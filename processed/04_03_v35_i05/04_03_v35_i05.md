Out of Africa 
ON A WARM AuGuST EVENING IN 1999, 
when New Haven was quiet and slow, a 
pianist from Columbus, Ohio, rook his last 
request at Amalfi Grill and stepped outside 
for a break. He walked down Temple 
Street, past the Omni Hotel, around the 
shadowy Green, and made his way back for 
his second set. Except that just past the cor-
ner, something in a window of a 
newly opened restaurant caught 
his eye, a certain fabric hanging 
from a ceiling over faces that 
somehow looked familiar. He 
p~ered in, realized chat the fabric 
and the faces were Ethiopian, 
and opened the door to soft 
lights and lentils. With a smile, 
he walked up to the man who 
was standing by the menus, and 
greeted him in Amharic. Yonas 
Asfaw, the owner of the restau-
rant, Lalibella, was taken aback. 
He had no idea chat this call man 
with a nice smile was none other 
than Charlie Sutton, the talented musician 
known in Ethiopia as the American who 
learned to play the one-stringed mesenge in 
Addis Ababa, the very man who first 
brought Ethiopian music to America near-
ly thirty-five years ago. 

This chance meeting was a wondrous 
surprise for Sutton, a "flashback," as he 
puts ic, to his days as a Peace Corps volun-
teer in Addis Ababa in the 6os. In those 
days, Ethiopia and irs music were unknown 
co most Americans, a rime when Sutton 
was strumming his guitar in his dorm at 
Harvard, and everywhere the rhythm of the 
day was swinging and shifting. The young 
musician transferred out of Harvard for 
two years to study at the Berldee School of 
Music with Andres Segovia protege 
Sophocles Papas, all the while trying to 
decide what to do next. And then, the day 
after graduation, when the walls of acade-
mia come rumbling down for every college 
student:, the 23-year-old musician, with a 
guitar and accordion in hand, boarded a 
plane bound for a Peace Corps training 
center in Salt Lake City. 

Sutton began to learn the Ethiopian , 
language of music even before he left Sale 
Lake City. He had been sitting out one 
evening, with his guitar and the Utah 
mountains for company, when his Amharic 
language teacher suddenly began to sing a 
popular Ethiopian harmony. It was the 
most haunci 
and beautiful melody 
Charlie had ever heard. Months later, in a 
darkened auditorium in Haile Selaissie 
University, the school where he caught 
English, Sutton was again mesmerized by 
the unique beauty of Ethiopian melodies. 
There before him on the stage, spinning 
these exotic melodies, was a band called 
Orchestra Erhiopia, made up of eleven 
musicians, each an expert at a particular 
traditional instrument. After the applause 
ended, Sutton approached one of the musi-
cians, Gecamesay Abbebe, to ask if he 
would teach him to play the mesenge. And 
so, Sutton, a man who now carries an 
Ethiopian joke book in his right coat pock-
et, began co learn how to make music with 
one string. 

Over the next five years, Sutton 
became a full-fledged member of Orchestra 
Ethiopia. Wearing traditional Ethiopian 
dress and carrying his second-hand mesen-
ge, he and the band traveled throughout 
the Ethiopian provinces. They played 
together in Addis Ababa hotels, enterrained 
at festivals, and even performed for the 
Emperor Haile Selassie in his royal palace. 

In some ways, you could say they helped 
keep traditional Ethiopian music alive. In 
1969, when funding for the group ran 
short, Sutton came up with the idea of a 
tour beyond the provinces to a country that 
had never heard a one-stringed instrument. 
And so that February, the Peace Corps vol-
unteer who had set out with an accordion 
and little idea of what would hap-
pen next, returned to the United 
S"cares a master of the mesenge. 

The group traveled to 20 cities, to 
Bronx college campuses, to town 
halls and high schools. And for 
three sweet minutes, Sutton and 
his band played their beautiful 
melodies on the Ed Sullivan Show 
for 40 million American viewers. 

Sitting near the window of 
Lalibella, where he and his wife 
have made a habit of dining on 
Tuesday nights, Sutton remem-
bers those days with a nostalgic 
smile. Sutton, who now calls Old 
Saybrook home, has three regular gigs now, 
and has just co-released a CD of piano jazz 
music. He still has the video of the Ed 
Sullivan show, and still sometimes plays the 
mesenge. And every Saturday night, Sutton 
sits at the upright piano at Lalibella and 
plays jazz standards, to an audience of din-
ers that may not know that the man at the 
piano once played for an Emperor.

Comic Relief 
REcENTLY, I FOUND MYSELF SITTING in the 
multi-purpose room of the Madison 
Library, clenching a straw between my 
teeth. JoAnne Kacillas, founder of "Surfing 
the Stress Laughter Clubs," was leading 
one of her hour-long laughing sessions. My 
classmates were a group of old ladies who 
called themselves "The Empey Nesters," or 
"Nesters" for short. "Careful now, don't let 
your lips touch the straw," our reacher 
instructed us. 

Kacillas, a former corporate lawyer, 
runs just the local leg of a global laughter 
movement. In 1995, Dr. Madan Kataria 
founded the first laughter club in Mumbai, 
India to promote the physical and psycho-
logical health of Indians, whom he believed 
were suffering from laughter deficiency. 
His classes, which allegedly reduce stress 
levels, benefit the immune system, and 
provide cardiovascular exercise, caught on 
quickly. Currently, there are over 800 
Laughter Clubs worldwide, with new chap-
ters opening in Budapest, Vietnam, and 
Iran in the near future. The laughter capi-
tal of America is Columbus, Ohio, where 
"Joyologist" Steve Wilson leads the "World 
Laughter Tour." Kacillas, who has a B.A. 
from Brown and a J.D. from Cornell, 
became a C.L.L. (Certified Laughter 
Leader) in 2002. Since th en, she has 
brought her "Surfing the Stress Laughter 
Clubs" to companies, hospitals, and 
schools throughour Connecticut. 

Though Wllson and Kataria are hard-
ly household names, the laughter move-
ment is receiving more and more publicity. 
Over the 
past year, 
a 
handful of 
Connecticut newspapers, radio stations 
and even television programs have featured 
Kacillas. She has not, as of yet, led a laugh-
ter class at Yale, but perhaps she should. 
Like other Yalies, I like to embrace my mis-
ery from time to time. I am a player, nay, 
master, of the "I-have-more-work-than-
you-and-haven't-slept-in-three-no-four-
days" contest. Bur Kacillas, who signs her 
emails "Together in Mirth, JoAnne," had 
encouraged me ro visit a class. As any 
C.L.L. will tell you, you don't have to be a 
natural giggler to benefit from a laughter 
club. Laughter Leaders don'r recommend 
telling jokes, arguing that few people find 
the same things funny. Instead of gags, they 
recommend a sequence of laughing exercis-
es that can give the benefits of laughter ro 
anyone, even those of us with no sense of 
humor. 

On my first Laughter C lub visit, I 
found myself the only non-Nester in the 
room, the youngesr student by about fifty 
APRIL 2003 
years. The women were very welcoming, 
and directed me to rhe rea rable w here 
muffins and cookies had been carefully 
arranged around an Easter centerpiece. 
"Oh what a beautiful papier-mache rab-
bit," one lady raved to her friend, "Audrey, 
you're so ralenred." Afrer sampling a cook-
ie, I took my seat in the communal circle 
with the mistress of papier-mache biting 
her straw to my left. Forcing your face inro 
the expression of a smile, we were 
informed, produces beta endorphins and 
gives your body the same benefits as a gen-
uine grin. I let my endorphins go to work 
and surveyed the rest of the group. The 
Nester opposite me was a tiny woman wirh 
bright red hair, whose stick-like body and 
large head gave the general impression of a 
lollipop. Another woman held her straw 
with an easy smile. She was, I noted, rhe 
only one wearing a skirt, though she had 
surprisingly nice legs rhat she wasn't afraid 
to show off. My cheeks were getting tired. 
T he smallest woman in rhe group, whose 
black orthopedics dangled several inches 
above rhe grey carpet, seemed to be feeling 
my pain. Clenching her straw dutifully, she 
raised her eyebrows in a desperate plea to 
our leader. 

Finally, JoAnne instructed us to 
remove our srraws and proceeded to lead us 
through a sequence of exercises. "Laughing 
is like jogging for your insides," she 
informed us. First, we walked around the 
room, shook each other's hands, and 
laughed "just because." Then came the 
"bow and arrow exercise." As we pulled 
back our imaginary strings, we began with 
light, "ha ha ha's." Then, when we released 
the arrow (taking care, as our reacher had 
instructed us, not ro hir anyone), we raised 
our hands above our heads and emitted a 
peal of "hee bee bee's." "One minute of 
deep laughter is equal to ten minutes on a 
rowing machine," JoAnne reminded us. 

We went on ro play the "Old 
Stony Face" game, in which one person 
tries to keep a straight face while her part-
ner tries to make her laugh. Across the 
room, Legs raised her arms in a "praise be 
hallelujah" sort of way, shaking her hands 
and asking the rhetorical quesrion "am-I-
funny-or-am-1-fwmy?" with bobbing eye-
brows. 

Next came the "lion laugh." With 
their eyes wide, fingers splayed, and 
tongues hanging loose, I could barely rec-
ognize les belles dames Lollipop and Papier-
Mache. Luckily, we quickly moved on to 
rhe "remote control exercise," which 
involved walking through the group and 
clicking at each other. As Lollipop clicked 
at me, I found myself searching for new 
ways to laugh, the "ho ho's," "hee bee's" 
and "ha ha's" seemed to be getting redun-
dant. I am proud to say that in the course 
of the exercise I upgraded from three fuzzy 
channels to basic cable. I am particularly 
fond of my husky "huwaaah ha ha ha'' and 
ascending "hoaaeee hee hee hee." 

As the class started to wind down, 
JoAnne spoke about the broader goals of 
laughter clubs. "The World Laughter Tour 
has as its mission inner peace and world 
peace." "Think globally, laugh locally," she 
advised, and gave us The Spirit of Laughter; 
Sensible Living Guidelines. 

On my way out, I asked some of my 
classmates wherher they liked the club. "It 
was fun to do once," one Nester replied, 
"but I wouldn't want to do it every week." 
As for me, I've got a straw in m y 
reerh right now.

Brain Drain 
SrrnNG IN HIS NEUROSCIENCE LAB ar Yale, 
with its laser scanning microscopes, the 
small village where Nenad Sescan grew up 
seems very far away. His story began in 
Croatia where his intelligence helped him 
ger inro a top-notch high school in a neigh-
boring rown. Despite his good grades, he. 
recalls char the reachers there made fun of 
his rural dialecr. 

While in high school, Sestan .:,.;as 
inspired by neuroscience, and decided to 
devote his life to research, enrolling in 
medical school in Zagreb, Croatia's capital. 
He even knew which lab he wanted to 
work in. When the professor there rejected 
him, Sestan would not give up. He got 
himself hired as a "slave," as he puts it, to a 
postdoctoral student in the lab, washing 
piles of Erlenmeyer flasks in order to watch 
real science happen. 

Ironically, luck came to Sestan in the 
form of the Yugoslavian civil war. The prin-
cipal investigator of the lab became 
immersed in politics, the Serbian student 
who hired him fled, and Sestan himself 
escaped t~e draft, leaving him alone in the 
lab, to work with only occasional guidance. 
When the war effort took away the lab's 
funding, Sestan looked frantically for other 
sources of money. He wrote to the Croatian 
community in the United States, asking its 
members to contribute to the war effort by 
supporting science. He got what he want-
ed. Equipped with new tools and chemi-
cals, he spent all his waking hours in the 
lab. His diligence paid off. At the age of 
twenty-one, Sestan published his first 
paper. 

With his new success, Sestan felt he 
had to go West. In Croatia, tenured acade-
mics srayed in their sears for decades, 
squeezing out young people, and there sim-
ply wasn't room for new scientists. The lack 
of resources also hindered research and stu-
dents 
scrounged 
to 
find 
organs. 
Pathologists were the only ones authorized 
to remove organs for examination. In order 
to have access to the human tissue needed 
to study neuroanatomy, "everyone wanted 
to have a pathologist as a friend," Sesran 
chuckles. 

Today Sestan feels that he has achieved 
his dream at Yale: he has the resources and 
dynamic colleagues he always wanted. 
Here, he says, "there is a constant flux of 
fresh young minds." 

Sestan has devoted most of his life to 
the study of science, and continues to do 
so. His foil, so to speak, has always.been the 
medical professional-in Croatia, and in 
America. Back home, the village doctor 
enjoyed high social status. It was customary 
to honor--or, rather, to bribe-the doctor 
for better care. Villagers consulted him for 
advice on a range of topics, from wine-
tasting to politics. Though academia was

also respectable, it did not convey the social 
currency of medicine, and many were 
seduced by that rival profession. In 
America, Sestan is also tempted by medi-
cine because it promises financial prosperi-
ty. He describes the medical students he 
teaches at Yale as lazy and uninterested; it 
seems co him chat they prefer good 
grades-the key to the coveted high 
income-to learning nature's secrets. 
This 
scientist-doctor 
dichotomy 
assumes a broad meaning for Sesran. He is 
troubled by the American lust for money; 
sometimes, he almost misses Communism. 
"There is so much social pressure here co be 
rich," he says. He knows that he is doing 
unpopular work. "Here, people say, 'Why 
be an underpaid biology grad student for 
six years? People want to make money"'-
so they stay away from science. The social 
ambitions surrounding Sestan in Croatia 
have been replaced by financial ones here, 
leaving him once again a member of a ded-
icated minority. 

In America, scientists come under a 
new kind of pressure. They are pressured to 
compete, co publish, and to be first on 
every discovery. But Sestan's passion for sci-
ence, cemented by years of hard work, has 
a special strength. "I love science, chat's 
what I want co do," Sestan says again and 
again, "and I am happy."

Reel to Real 
A SLACK GIRL COMES HOME ro find her 
stepfather sitting on a couch surrounded by 
liquor bottles, cigarette butts, and blunt 
wraps. The rwo argue about why she's skip-
ping school and getting bad grades. The 
stepfather pushes her against the wall and 
raises his belt. She cowers, covering her 
face. Outside, a police officer cuffs a loiter-
ing black teenager and pats him down. The 
cop gets in his face, and the boy shakes his 
head in fear. The camera curs again to the 
girl, who is running up to the officer. He 
blows her off with a skeptical remark, 
threatening co arrest her for interfering. 
She walks away and sits down on the curb, 
holding her hands to her face. 

In a later scene, the same police officer 
climbs out of bed in the morning and pulls 
on his dark blue socks and shiny black 
combat boots. At the same time, in his own 
bedroom, a sixteen-year-old boy pulls on 
his beige Timberland boots. The officer 
puts on his blue uniform and his badge, 
while the boy ties a belt around baggy jeans 
and pins a button on his shirt with a photo 
of his dead uncle. Later, a group of students 
corner him at his locker and pressure him 
to cut class. The police officer's superiors 
pressure him to participate in a corruption 
scheme. 

These scenes are part of a film shot by 
eight New Haven youths. The movie is half 
drama-written by the teens and scarring 
themselves and police academy cadets-
and half documentary. Starting next year, 
the New Haven Police Academy wi II use 
the film to train graduating cadets to 
respect the youth population they will 
patrol. 

Four groups collaborated on the film. 
American Beat, a local documentary film 
company, is producing, New Haven high 
school students are writing, acting, and 
directing, the New Haven Police Academy 
cadets star. But the driving force behind the 
project has been Youth Rights Media 
(YRM}, a non-profit incorporated by Yale 
Law students in 2002. 

Youth Rights Media is a group of 
twelve Yale law students who teach about a 
dozen students per year about their judicial 
rights. This year, the group has visited 
every freshman classroom in New Haven, 
giving ninety-minute presentations dealing 
with everything from Miranda rights to 
search-and-seizure laws to the conse-
quences of resisting arrest. Now YRM has 
brought police into the solution, allowing 
them to act with rhe srudents to educate 
their Academy peers. 

Most of the youths involved with the 
project have had bad experiences with the 
police or know of people who have. Shari 
Cabiness, a 17-year-old who attends 
Gateway Community college, remembers, 
"I was being harassed for loitering when 
there's no place to go but in the street. 
[When cops see you) on the corners, they 
act like there's some place co go. You can't 
even be in your community without them 
chinking you're selling drugs or making 
trouble." The problems differ by genders. 
"Males feel stigmatized by sight. Females 
are concerned abour nor being taken seri-
ously when they need the police's help, 
being thought of as hysterical," said Taylor. 

The young filmmakers compiled these 
experiences to create the script for the film. 
While the movie allows the students to 
act as teachers, they have also learned from 
production. In a classroom in the Latino 
Youth D'evelopment Center on the edge of 
the Hill neighborhood, Taylor, YRM's . 
Laura McCarger, and six high school stu-
dents plan the movie's audio, visual, and 
logistical details for six hours a week. Taylor 
stands next to a blackboard and challenges 
the group: "What's going to happen after 
the close-up on his face, Shari? What hap-
pens after a close-up of someone looking at 
something?" Meanwhile, in another room, 
set-director TaycheUe Gordino, 15, is typing 
rhe filming schedule for the students' 
spring br~k. As the set director, Gordino 
must get written permission from property 
owners to film in their buildings. Aside 
from learning the "nitry-gritry" of filmmak-
ing, the students learn how to voice their 
message. "[They are] learning the value of 
tempering and refining their point of view. 
They realize they can't just be reactionary 
and lash out at their audience because it's 
nor going to be effective," said Taylor. 

One of the most important by-prod-
ucts of the project has been the personal 
connections forged between police and 
youth during interviews and production. 
"They helped us chink about officers dif-
ferently, because they're the same people we 
are and had the same experiences we had," 
said Cabiness. 

The message of Gordino is, "T he 
badge don't make you who you are. You 
make what the badge is to you." Ideally, 
says Cabiness, "I would wane [the police] 
to learn interaction and communication 
with the youth, understanding with the 
youth, how to approach them on a differ-
ent level." It remains co be seen whether 
Gordino's message, spinning off the reels of 
American Beat, will make a difference in 
the real world.

**Title: English Station: A Fair Haven Story**

**Page number(s): 10-11**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
E
NGLISH STATION WAS BUILT lN THE LATE 1940S on a small spit 
of land, just off the banks of the Mill River. The plant was 
designed co provide electricity from hydraulic energy and to 
burn oil. Bordered by Grand and Wolcott Streets, English Station 
lies near the heart of Fair Haven and has been a thorn in the sides 
of its owners for decades. In the 1980s, federal standards became 
more stringent for factory emissions. This meant char United 
Illuminating (Ul), the owner of the plant at the rime, was running 
a dinosaur that would have co be shut down or cleaned up. The 
obsolete boilers were designed to burn oil so crude it was essential-
ly tar, at some temperatures thick enough to walk on. Clean-up 
would have cost several hundreds of millions of dollars. In addition 
to this, a new regulation, aimed at curbing monopolies on power, 
required companies to choose between being generators or distrib-
utors of energy. UI, owning several ocher power plants and also 
some power lines in New Haven, chose co cur its losses and aban-
don its plants. 

United Illuminating managed to sell all of its plants e~cept for 
English Station, which stood deserted until 1998. Because the envi-
ronmental liabilities and the cleanup necessary co restart the power 
plant were so significant, English Station rotted on the market for 
years before a tiny privately owned offshoot of UI, Quinnipiac 
Energy (QE) acquired it. UI handed QE a lump sum of $4·5 mil-
lion to take the plant off its hands. Scott DeGeeter, project manag-
er for QE, makes no bones about the transaction: "It is public 
knowledge that we were paid to rake it. UI could have spent $15 mil-
lion to tear the place to the ground or they could have paid us $4.5 
million to rake the property and all the environmental liabilities and 
ongoing responsibilities of the property for one third the cost." 

DeGeeter readily admits that the plant was unwanted: "As 
soon as you walk into an old station with environmental liabilities 
that are unknown, you need to be able to make a lor of money right 
away off of that piece of property to make ir attractive enough to 
take those liabilities. You could be buying tens of millions of dollars 
of clean-up costs." But Quinnipiac Energy was far from an unsus-
pecting buyer. Because QE was originally part of Ul, it was famil-
iar with the plant and irs risks. 

Despite the unusual terms of the transaction, rhe owners ofQE 
saw English Station as a profitable venture. Mark Minninberg, for-
mer front man for Qunnipiac Energy, tried ro sell the community 
on the purchase. He staged slideshows for Fair Haven and New 
Haven residents, oucling propositions that seemed too good to be 
true. And they were. Originally, QE claimed ir wanted to burn oil 
only until it could afford co convert to natural gas, which, incred-
ibly, was projected to have a net clean air benefic. Yer when the com-
pany presented its final proposal, there was no mention of natural 
gas. 

The proposal was immediately met with protesr in Fair Haven 
and across the state: Connecticur Fund for rhe Environment, New 
Haven Enviornmental Justice Coalition, and New Haven's Mayor 
John DeStefano formally opposed the permit to the Department of 
Environmental Protection (DEP) during several public hearings. 
Quinnipiac Energy won the first two rounds: The permit was rec-
ommended by the staff of the DEP and later by an appeal officer, 
Janice Deshais. On March 19, the opposition made a final attempt 
co get the permit denied in a hearing in front of the Commissioner 
of the DEP, Arc Roque. 


**Title: A New School for Fair Haven**

A
S THIS LITTLE BATTLE ESCAJ-ATEO, in another part of tOwn, 
Fair Haveners were celebrating a victory. The School 
Construction Project, an organization affiliated with the 
New Haven School Board, had been granted funding co build a 
new school in the community. The school would serve children in 
kindergarten through eighth grade-the first of its kind in the city. 
''All our other buildings are renovations and additions, and we have 
a couple of new buildings to replace some older buildings, but this 
one is a complete start from scratch," said Susan Weisselberg, coor-
dinator of the School Construction Project. 

The new school is greatly needed. Like many low-income com-
munities, Fair Haven is plagued by overcrowded schools and is 
forced to bus hundreds of students to other districts every day. In 
fact, it has been 30 years since Fair Haven built a new school. At 
s36.7 million, it is one of the most expensive education projects in 
Connecticut, and a high profile success story for the community. 

Unfortunately, the school will sit just a few hundred yards from 
the plant. Weisselberg said the Board of Education looked at many 
different locations and finally decided on this one for several rea-
sons: "This was a part of Fair Haven that was underserved by 
schools. Another aspect is that New Haven is quire developed and 
it is very difficult co find land for almost anything but particularly 
for new schools. We looked at almost anything ... residential prop-
erties, industrial properties, vacant lots." They could nor build on 
wetlands or park land, and they wanted the school to be on James 
Street, so the choices were limited. In a city nearly filled co capaci-
ty, there was simply no other space. 

In other words, there was no lapse of judgment on the part 
of the School Construction Project. The Project was keenly aware 
of the nearness of the power plant; they just had roo little to work 
with. Weisselberg insists that the proximity of English Station was 
taken into account when designing the school. Models showed that 
the effects of the plant would be minimal. But Jay Brotman, the 
architect, was skeptical. So when designing the air conditio~ing sys-
tem for the school, Brotman made sure to leave room for extra fil-
ters and scrubbers to purify the incoming air. In addition, the gym 
and the pool were placed on the plot ofland nearest the plant, while 
the main facility would be adjacent to it. But English Station was 
not the only industrial concern. Brotman was more worried about 
the Talmage Brothers oyster shell operation. "There is an at odor 
certain times of the year" -another reason why an internal air sys-
tem is a necessity. 

English Station seems to loom like a black cloud over the new 
school. But the power plant was initially not a concern of Fair 
Haveners. "To be honest with you, the concerns we have heard are: 
When will it be done, we can't wait to send our kids there," says 
Weisselberg. "We had a 
lot of support from the 
community 
to 
build 
something there, to put a 
school there. They were 
very excited about it 
because Fair Haven K-8 
will have a swimming 
pool and a full sized gym." 
Weisselberg also noted 
that if English Station 
refires, the particulates 
released will go beyond 
the school's boundaries. 
Because most of the chil-
dren who will be attending the school live in the area, they will 
already be dealing with pollution on every corner.

**Page number(s): 11**

I
N A CITY WHERE AIR QUALITY already fails co meet standards, one 
more plant may be one too many. But QE has found a way 
around such objections. 

Quinnipiac Energy's plan for operation is clever, perhaps even 
insidious, but ultimately legal. The only way QE could be granted 
a permit ro burn oil is if English Station operates as a "minor 
source" of pollution. To fall under this classification, the plant will 
have to adhere to strict emissions regulations. Emissions are regu-
lated in cerms of tons of particulates released per year. Even low-sul-
fur diesel oil (relatively clean fuel) would be tightly monitored-
only 25 tons of nitrous oxide and 6. 5 tons of sulfur dioxides per year. 

But the loophole is that these tons of particulates can be released 
any time, whether that be over one day or three hundred. To max-
imize profit, English Station will run as a "peaking plant," meaning 
ir will burn only 23 calendar days each year, for three to five hun-
dred hours, but it will produce as many tons of particulates in this 
condensed period as a "minor source" is allowed to produce all year. 

QE will sell the energy on high demand days, including the honest 
days of summer and coldest of winter, when air conditioning and 
hearing-use are at their peaks, allowing them co rurn a profit despite 
the immense carrying costs. 

These short bursts of energy are usually sold on an electricity 
spot market, similar ro a stock market. On high demand days, 
transmission companies that exceed their allotment of contracted 
electricity must purchase extra power. Sellers with the lowest bids 
get picked; but sellers don't know what their competitors are offer-
ing, making the business quite a gamble. Shrewdly, QE has con-
tracted with UI and Connecticut Light and Electricity. This takes 
the risk out of the peak demand market for QE and also sets the 
prices for the transmitters, blurring the generator-distributor dis-
tinction and circumventing anti-monopoly regulation. 

Ultimately the plant will provide only seven new jobs for Fair 
Haven and without question 
will add pollutants to the air. 
On the other hand, it will gen-
erate over half a million dollars 
in tax revenue for the city of 
New 
Haven. 
Quinnipiac 
Energy has even opted to use 
relatively clean fuel. According 
to DeGeeter, QE's fuel con-
tains one-sixth the sulfur of the 
fuel used to heat homes. He 
equated the additional English 
Station emissions to adding 
four new transit buses to the 
city. 

Bur whether English Station will be equivalent to four or four 
million new transit buses seems beside the point: Quinnipiac 
Energy is acting within the scope of the law. As DeGeeter emphat-
ically stressed, "You cannot under law impose on me anything more 
stringent than if I meet the current regulations ... We exceed the 
current regulations, therefore there is really legally no way that they 
can deny you a permit. That's the basis of all the law in this coun-
try, right? You set a standard; you meet a standard; you can conduct 
your business." In March, the DEP agreed. 


**Title: The DEP and the Interveners**
**Page number(s): 11-12**

T
HE DEP RECOMMENDED QuiNNIPIAC ENERGY be granted 
the permit because QE met the regulations. But for the 
interveners, there is still hope. There are a few sentences in 
the Connecticut Protection Act that give an agency the right to 
impose stricter standards than the law requires. Elizabeth Gilson, a 
lawyer representing the Mayor, summed up the argument: "In this 
case, there is one teeny-weenie footnote that we hang our hat on. In 
cases where it's an agency hearing, the agency has the expertise to 
look at where there's unreasonable pollution, regardless of the exis-
tence of the regs. And because this is a minor source that's blowing 
irs wad in 23 days, I'm going to argue that the regs don't apply so 
the Commissioner doesn't even have ro look at them." In other 
words, because there will be intense emissions over a short period of 
time, the agency has the right to step in. But Gilson faces an uphill 
battle since the DEP rejected this argument in the first two hear-
ings. 

In fact, the DEP has put a lor of time into this case over the 
last several years. Ric Pirolli, a representative from the DEP and 
head of Air Pollution Control, even made a presentation to the 
commissioner. "We're not on a side," Pirolli said. "We were just 
there ro present what we did and what actions we rook on the appli-
cation, but we did propose to grant these 
permits." This raises the question of 
whether there is an argument compelling 
enough to justify the commissioner over-
ruling his staff. Will Rocque really side-step 
the laws for the sake of a minor polluter? 

But that is not to say an argument 
does not exist. The New Haven emergency 
room admissions for asthma are among the 
highest in the state. Asthma is exacerbated 
by particulates in the air, and particulates 
are exactly what English Station will be 
spewing. Or. Mark Mitchell, President of 
the 
Connecticut 
Coalition 
for 
Environment, testified on this subject dur-
ing each 1-),earing. "As a physician, I'm say-
ing that these people are at risk-they are 
at risk for more asthma attacks, they are at 
risk for death from asthma, and because of 
the particulates in the air, they are at risk 
for sudden death from heart disease and 
respiratory disease. We would expect to see 
a significant increase in the deaths during 
the time this plant is operating." OeGeeter, 
unsurprisingly, does not see any cause for 
alarm. In fact, in the hearing before 
Deshais, QE brought in an expert to calm 
any nerves about possible health risks. The 
expert testified that the sulfides English 
Station will emit are as benign as those 
breathed in an asthma inhaler-an asser-
tion Gibson considered "egregious." 

Obviously sucking on a smokestack is 
not equivalent to puffing an inhaler, but 
even an increase in asthma rates, an issue 
that could legitimately tip the scales, is 
uncercain. Because of plants like English 
Station, which have been pumping our pol-
lutants for decades, Fair Haven already has 
an unusually high number of asthmatic 
children. But asthma is not caused by a few 
exua particulates in the air; parciculates just 
worsen the condition. So although keeping 
English Station closed might prevent a few 
additional asthma attacks, it would not 
solve the asthma problem. 

Asthma is just one component of what 
Dr. Mitchell identifies as the "English 
Station problem." English Station is an 
environmental justice issue because Fair 
Haven's ambient air quality affects poor 
blacks and Hispanics. Fair Haven is over 50 
percent Hispanic and nearly 25 percent 
black. The irony of this debacle is that on 
those hot summer days when English 
Station is spewing its particulates most 
intensely, Fair Haven residents, most of 
whom live near the plant, will be opening 
their windows wide and breath-
ing in even dirtier air.

whom do not have air conditioning, will be 
opening their windows wide and breathing 
in even dirtier air. Meanwhile, English 
Station's energy will be traveling on high 
speed power lines straight out of Fair 
Haven to Great Gatsby mansions on Long 
Island and country estates in Fairfield 
County. "It is clearly not fair by any stretch 
of the imagination," Mitchell said. 

While it might be true that Fair Haven 
residents use less energy for air condition-
ing, to claim that English Station is sub-
jecting the poor people of Fair Haven to 
harm for the sake of the rich seems arbi-
trary. In the end, English Station is no dif-
ferent than any of the other industries cur-
rently operating in Fair Haven. Residents 
will bear the brunt of the harm associated 
with plants that serve people elsewhere. 

Art Rocque has two options. He can 
follow his job description and "well and 
faithfUlly enforce the law" or he can use 
discretion and invoke a footnote for the 
sake of the community. If Rocque simply 
enforces, QE will be granted its permit and 
start operating as construction begins on 
the neighboring school. 

Could this little dinosaur of a power 
plant eclipse one of Fair Haven's greatest 
success stories in 30 years? Perhaps. But 
who would shoulder the blame? The DEP 
is 
enforcing 
the laws; 
the 
School 
Construction Project could not find a bet-
ter spot; the rich people of Long Island are 
legitimate 
energy 
consumers. 
And 
Quinnipiac Energy, the obvious target, is 
just following the rules.

A
S WORKERS AT YALE READIED FOR BATTLE against the University 
late last February, a senior member of their team was conspic-
uously absent. John Wilhelm, the grizzled leader of the Hotel 
and Restaurant Employees International Union (HEREIU) and a 
top negotiator for the Yale unions currently seeking a new contract, 
had slipped away to a resort hotel in southern Florida. He was there 
to address an urgent problem: the decay of America's national labor 
movement. As a result of the recent economic downturn, a strong-
ly anti-union federal government, and an expanding global market, 
union membership across the country was in a downward spiral. 

For more than a year, Wilhelm's own union's membership had 
diminished by as much as 40 percent, and the numbers for many 
other unions were worse. All of the big players in the American 
Federation of Labor and Congress oflndustrial Organi~tion (AFL-
CIO), the largest union al.liance in the country, had convened in 
Florida for the group's annual conference, where they scrambled for 
a solution to save the dying labor movement. 

After the conference, Wilhelm returned to New Haven, where 
he joined a raucous army of over 4,000 striking custodians, clerical 
workers, hospital workers, and graduate srudencs. They marched up 
Elm Street behind a stern-faced Jesse Jackson, who bellowed phras-
es of condemnation into the cold night air. For the next week, pick-
eters protested oucside important Yale buildings in the mornings 
and attended motivational speeches and rallies in the afternoons. 

AFL-CIO President John Sweeney made an appearance, as did 
Princeton professor Cornel West. It was a carefully orchestrated 
show, a calculated demonstration of hard-won union strength. 

Then the news hit: At the conference in Florida, far from the 
limelight of the Yale strike, John Wilhelm and several other labor 
leaders were reported to have staged "something of a palace coup" 
at the AFL-CIO, according to Businm ~ek magazine. They had 
forged a "new governing body to run the federation" -a committee 
of 15 labor leaders who would meet every month in Washington, 
D.C. and advise President Sweeney. Business wt-ek strongly implied 
that Wilhelm was the brains behind the takeover. "Today's labor 
movement was invented in the 1950s and hasn't changed much 
since," Wilhelm declared. "We noed dramatic change." Wilhelm, it 
seemed, had much more on his mind than mere contracts for Yale's 
workers and recognition for ics graduate students as he marched 
alongside his comrades. The swirl of union activity at Yale was turn-
ing out to be something far more complicated than it seemed-and 
John Wilhelm was beginning to look like the possible key to an 
unfurling trade union revolution. 

W 
ILHELM DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A MAN EAGER TO SEIZE the reins 
of the national labor movement. His face and body are 
worn by years of service to his cause. At 58, he walks with a 
cane to support his newly-replaced hip. His gait is that of an elder 
statesman, one who has put in his time and now wanes simply to 
relax and enjoy his memories . 

But there is a fighter beneath Wilhelm's weary facade. He is the 
quiet mastermind behind the last 35 years of Yale union activity, the 
organizer of thousands of workers, the overseer of nine contract 
negotiations, and the figurehead of seven acrimonious strikes. For 
as long as Yale's custodial and clerical workers have stood together 
against Yale, Wilhelm has been there. The story of the present labor 
strife is, in essence, the story of John Wilhelm's life. 

Ironically, Wilhelm found his calling at the very University that 
he later made a career of tormenting. A member of the class of 1967, 
he graduated Magna Cum Laude from and was a member of the 
Phi Beta Kappa. For the most pan, he spent his time at Yale 
immersed in 6os radicalism. Trips to civil righcs and anti-war 
protests were supplemented by investigative journeys into the slums 
of New Haven and academic work focused on left-wing heroes. 

Wilhelm attributes his radical politics to his single mother, an 
uncommonly progressive woman from Virginia coal coumry who 
raised him on the twin doctrines of liberalism and traditional 
unionism. When the question of de-segregating the schools in 
Wilhelm's home county of Arlington made its way into federal 
coun in 1958, he remembers that she surprised him and his siblings 
by telling them to take the day off from school and go down to the 
courthouse. "She said, 'You'll learn a lot more in that courthouse 
than you will in any schoolroom today,"' he recalls. 

But nothing jolted Wilhelm's political consciousness like expe-
riencing fir~t-hand one of the poorest cities in the country. Near the 
end of college, he joined a group called the American Independent 
Movement that was working to reinvigorate the dilapidated Hill 
neighborhood. His daily encounters with decaying neighborhoods 
and prosperous slumlords convinced him of a simple idea: poverty 
needs to be eradicated. "It seemed to me that virtually all the prob-
lems that people in the H ill neighborhood were wrestling with 
were, at bottom, because they were poor," he remembers. " You 
could fight about schools, housing, lots of things-but if people 
remained poor, it seemed to me they were going to remain power-
less." Frusuated, he remained in New Haven after graduation, 
working to help the destitute and preaching the gospel of econom-
ic empowerment. 

Then, one day in 1969, he came across a small want ad in the 
Nnu Hawn Rqjstn: "Labor leader trainee wanted. Long hours, low 
pay. Must be single." With the exception of the last stipulation, 
W Uhelm thought himself a good fit, and responded to the ad and 
arranged an interview. He landed the job and suddenly found him-
self at the head of a small New Haven service union, Local217, with 
little idea of what he was getting into. 

As it turned out, the man who hired him, Vincent Sirabella, 
was kicking off a massive campaign to revamp union activity at 
Yale. He had recently become the first leader ofYale's only union, 
the custodial and dining hall workers' Local 35· When Sirabella 
came on board, Local 35 was in bad shape. A year earlier, Yale had 
defeated the leaderless and ineffective union in its first strike in two 
decades, and had recently hired two notoriously anti-union execu-
tives. The contracts of the sos and 6os were based on a ~ry infor-
mal, quid pro quo understanding between labor and management-
low but secure wages, in exchange for peace and stability. But now 
the University seemed to have strayed from its former path, and the 
unions were terrified. 

In the ensuing struggle, which produced three strikes in the 
span of a single decade, WUhelm found not only a home. but a 
father. For ten years, he tagged alongside Sirabella as an apprentice. 
For Wilhelm, Sirabella embodied the possibility of an enlightened 
unionism--one that could reconcile liberal ideas of respcc::t and 
inclusion with old-fashioned union muscle. •Vinny was an cctraor-
dinary man," Wilhelm remembers. "He had an unusual theory: In 
order for the labor movement to revitalize and re-energize icsdf, it 
had to tap into the kind of energy typified by the civil rights moYe-
ment and the anti-war m~ment." 

To many union leaders, Sirabella and Wdhdm musr have 
seemed eccentric and idealistic. At mat time, the trade union .IDOV'e-
ment was openly xenophobic and often very conservuiw. But 
something in Sirabella's vision captivated Walhdm. He tboupt that 
he could use it to bring about serious change at Yale and pollihly 
elsewhere. When Sirabdla left his ~t at Local3s in 1978, WDbelm 
gladly stepped up to replace him.

T 
HE YALE OF THE EAIU.Y 8os WAS THE TESTING G.OVMD for 
Wilhelm's idealism. It was clear that the University wu going 
to make life tough for the unions in at least the fOreseeable 
furure, and Local 35 was determined to preempt agression. Finally,

APRIL 2003 
a plan crystallized: Moum a campaign ro 
organize rhe University's mostly white, 
female, and middle-class clerical and tech-
nical workers. The logic was simple; if 
Local 35 could bring in these workers, they 
could create an alliance with a monopoly 
on the University's most essential workers. 

So in 1980, Wilhelm enlisted the help 
and resources of Local 35's parent union, 
the Hotel and Restaurant Employees 
International Union (HEREIU), to initiate 
a massive organizing campaign. Outside 
unions had tried to organize Yale's white-
collar set a number of times to no avail. But 
the HEREIU organizers were confident 
chat this time would be different. They 
had inside connections: Many of the Local 
35 members had spouses and relatives who 
worked clerical and technical jobs at the 
University. The organizers quickly found 
hundreds of people interested in unioniz-
ing and filed for a National Labor Relations 
Board (NLRB) election, the standard 
process for organizing a new union. In the 
meantime, workers and students went 
down to the NLRB hearings to agitate. In 
May of 1983, the hard work paid off: Yale's 
clerical and technical workers narrowly 
won the election, and Local 34 was born. 

Bur the fight to establish Local 34 had 
just begun. The union's attempt to negoti-
ate its fuse contract with the University 
stalled at the end of 1984. The cause of this 
breakdown was unclear, but union mem-
bers suspected that the University was try-
ing to break the fledgling local's back 
before it got off the ground. As Wilhelm 
put it, "The University basically dared 
them to go on strike." Indeed, a strike 
could mean good things for a University 
itching to get rwo unions off its back. The 
loose alliance formed ben.veen Locals 34 
and 35 dyring the organizing drive matched 
up rwo very different workforces-a set of 
mostly white women and a group of most-
ly working-class men, many of whom were 
minorities. For this reason, it stood to 
crumble far more easily than the average 
u11ion coalition. 

After Local 34 officially went on strike 
in September of 1984, Yale told the mem-
bers of Local 35 that they would be fired if 
they supported che strikers. Even Wilhelm 
wasn't sure rhat the custodial and dining 
hall workers, whose contract didn't expire 
until the beginning of the next year, would 
stand up for their co-workers. But they did. 
An estimated 90 percent ofLocal35 walked 
out the next day and lent their support to 
what turned out to be a ten and a half week 
strike. When I asked Wilhelm to explain 
how that seemingly miraculous turn tran-
spired, his response was cryptic. He 
referred ro his old reacher: "Vinny always 
used ro say, 'If you told the workers the 
truth, if you gave them the facts they need-
ed, they would figure out the right thing ro 
do."' 

Ir takes more than the truth to orga-
nize workers, however. The campaign that 
Wilhelm engineered was a product of care-
ful srraregizing and skillful politicking. He 
played a forceful role behind the scenes, 
cozying up to the union membership while 
still playing hardball with the University. 
Several weeks into the strik~ Wilhelm 
urged workers to return to their jobs while 
students were away for the holiday. The 
idea was not only that strikers would get a 
break from the picket lines, but that the 
unions would be in a position to strike 
again when students returned. The tactic, 
dubbed "Home for the Holidays," turned 
our ro be decisive. In January of 1985,

Nobody thought a week-long_ strike would 
settle things bJ itself, but we thought it was 
necessarv to disprove all that bullshit. 
Wilhelm negotiated a contract for Local 34 
that increased wages by more than 20 per-
cent for its traditionally underpaid female 
workforce. Later, Local 35 received a con-
tract as well-one that Wilhelm considers 
the best in the union's history. 


The organizers held a jubilant celebra-
tion in Center Church on the New Haven 
Green, where they praised Wilhelm's work. 
The press heralded the settlement and 
overall organizing drive as a watershed 
moment in labor history, a time of 
unprecedented success for female and 
minority workers in the expanding service 
sector. One member of Local 34 raved to 
Th~ Ntw York Tim~ about Wtlhelm, "He's 
interested in everybody as a person, not 
just a number. I would trust him with the 
lives of my kids. That's how I feel about 
him." Wilhelm, for his part, down plays his 
leadership during the strike. "I certainly 
played a role in it," he told me, "and I'm 
proud of my role in it, but that was a vic-
tory of literally hundreds of people. You 
can't win something like that without a lot 
of people deciding, 'I'm going to be a 
leader."' He prefers instead to talk about 
what he got from it all: "That was a very, 
very wonderful learning experience for 
me-an inspirational experience." Indeed, 
Wilhelm was just getting started. 


W 
H.EN I MET WILHELM at a coffee 
shop several weeks after March's 
busy five-day strike, he casually 
tossed around the buzzwords that have 
made him famous in recent years: 
"respect," "partnership," "cooperation," 
"give and take." Since his promotion from 
leader of Local 35 to Western Regional 
Director of HEREIU and then to the 
AI>RJL 2003 
Presidency of HEREIU he has broken the 
mold of union leaders who antagonize 
CEOs. 


Many, 
including 
Yale 
President 
Richard Levin, still paint Wilhelm's ideolo-
gy as a front for more insidious interests. 
But out West in the desert, where Wilhelm 
started working in 1987, he proved that it is 
more than just talk. In Las Vegas, where he 
helped initiate one of the biggest organiz-
ing campaigns of the 20TH century, he 
devised a novel strategy of enlisting promi-
nent casino and hotel owners to fight other 
owners who were giving unions a hard 
time. He went straight to the big guys: 
Steve Wynn, the owner of the Bellagio, and 
Terri Lanni, CEO of the MGM Grand, 
were recruited to aid in two bitter, but suc-
cessful strikes in the early 90s, one of which 
lasted over six years. In a 2002 speech, 
President Bush's Director of the Office of 
Personnel Management, Kay Cole James, 
praised WUhelm's approach, saying she 
wanted "everyone to see the incredible way 
this union leader and casino manager work 
together. It was just incredible. John 
Wilhelm . . . and Terry Lanni .... Both of 
these guys are tough. It was interesting to 
me that, in the midst of negotiations, when 
their issue and their industry came under 
attack, those guys locked arms." 


Wilhelm has also sought alliances with 
political leaders, even those on the opposite 
side of the fence. He is reported to consort 
with a vast array of in.Buential figures, 
including New York Governor George 
Pataki, former Mexican Foreign Minister 
Jorge Castaiieda, and Connecticut Senator 
Joseph Lieberman (whose first state senate 
bid was co-organized by WUhelm's mentor, 
Vinny Sirabella). When pressed on how 
these relationships have helped his cause, 
he demured, saying that sometimes politi-
cal leaders can be valuable strategically, but 
that " there's no real political influence 
based on personal relationships with politi-
cians. 


Republican SenatOr John Ensign 
from Nevada tells a different story. In a 
speech given at the Teamsters Union 2001 
Convention, he outlined how WUhelm 
once influenced his vote on an important 
UniOn ISSUeS: 

Initially, you know, my party was 
for the Paycheck Protection Act and 
most people in my party still are. 
But ... John Wilhelm, because he 
had a relationship with me, he came 
and he talked to me about how this 
was really a states' rights issue. This 
should be left up to each state, and 
each state individually. So as a US 
Senator, we should not vote for any 
kind of paycheck protection. It was 
because of that relationship that he 
had with me that I sat down, he 
convinced me of it, and it was pret-
ty easy to support him in that effort 
and the rest of the union movement 
in that effort. 


In the early 90s, Wilhelm returned to 
negotiate another contentious contract 
with the tools he had sharpened in Las 
Vegas. But New Haven is not Las Vegas, 
and Wilhelm found it difficult to apply his 
tactics. The Yale administration, led by 
newly hired President Richard Levin, had 
little interest in working with the unions, 
or at least in working with them on their 
terms. Wilhelm calls this "fuck-you time, 
again" -a period marked by active disre-
gard for honest bargaining on the part of 
the University. He does nor understand


--- Page 20 ---

how a University so focused on intellectual 
debate could be so averse to treating its 
employees as equals worthy of collabora-
tion. "Ironically, I couldn't ·learn anything 
about genuine labor-management coopera-
tion in the best interests of employers and 
workers at Yale," he told me. "But some-
how I learned volumes about it in Las 
Vegas." 


For its part, the University has in 
recent years adopted some of the catch-
phrases that WUhelrn champions as his 
own." . Last 
spring, 
Levin 
announced, "We are eager to work with 
Locals 34 and 35 to find a new way of struc-
turing our relationship, relying on day-to-
day collaboration rather than periodic con-
frontation." But no action followed. 


Despite using the S3.1Jle rhetoric, all that the 
unions and management have achieved at 
this point _is one expired contract and a 
week-long strike. 


ITH THE ADMINISTRATIONS DOORS 
closed, Wilhelm moved on to new 
strategies. He advocated fostering 
inclusion not only with employers, but 
within unions themselves. In the late 90s, 
he focused his efforts on an issue tradition-
ally ignored in labor movement politics: 
the working rights of immigrants, both 
legal and illegal, and of minorities overall. 


At the AFL-CIO convention of 1999, 
Wilhelm lobbied for the federation to rec-
ognize the rights of illegal immigrants to 
organize. The issue was tabled, but 
John 
Sweeney 
appointed 
WUhelm chair of a new committee to 
explore the issue further. WUhelrn used the 
position to engineer another unexpected 
victory. After his committee voted unani-
mously to reject the AFL-CIO's hostile pol-
icy on illegal immigrants, the Federation's 
executive council did the same in 2000. 


It was a stunning move by an organi-
zation that had historically viewed illegal 
immigrants as obstacles to its own mem-
bership's well-being. It was also a welcome 
PR move for HEREIU, which, despite hav-
ing done a great deal of progressive orga-
nizing. was still considered one of the most 
corrupt and least visionary unions in the 
country. The union's largest local, in Las 
Vegas, had been in cahoots with the infa-
mous gangster Bugsy Siegel in the 40s, 
while the founder of that local is said to 
20 
have been shot to death and abandoned 
naked in the desert. The last president of 
HEREIU, Edward Hanley, was ushered 
out of office by allegations of ties to 
Chicago 
mobsters, and even when 
Wuhelm took over in 1998, the Justice 
Department kept close tabs on his admin-
istration. 


With the Justice Department on their 
backs, progressive organizing was sweet 
relief for Wilhelm and the union. This 
highly pragmatic strategy was aimed both 
at bringing more bodies to the union and 
in fostering strong bonds among existing 
members. "When unions don't reach out, 
they are inherently unable to represent 
their members properly," he told me. 
"When unions .look narrowly at a group of 
employees working for an employer, they 
don't think about the fact that those 
employees are not just workers-they're 
parts of communities, they belong to 
churches." 


In the summer of 2001, Wilhelm took 
another step toward transforming the 
American labor movement. After traveling 
to Mexico to meet with Mexican Foreign 
Minister Jorge Castaneda to discuss illegal 
workers in the United States, he persuaded 
Castafieda to speak at the HEREIU annu-
al convention. It was the first time that an 
American union had conversed seriously 
with a foreign government about labor 
issues. 


In this context, the recent union strife 
at Yale-already forgotten by many-has 
been decisive for Wilhelm's plan to change 
the labor movement. The partnership 
between Locals 34 and 35, the Graduate 
Employees and Students Organization 
(GESO), and the Yale-New Haven 
Hospital workers is a serious test of 
Wilhelm's unique brand of unionism. It 
represents the ultimate motley crew: loyal 
custodial, clerical, and technical workers; 
educated graduate students who will leave 
campus after seven years; and poor, unor-
ganized hospital workers. So far, the 
alliance has held, but it hasn't yielded any 
substantive gains in terms of organizing or 
contracts. GESO and the hospital workers 
are still out in the cold, while Locals 34 and 
35's contract negotiations have been some 
of the most unproductive in the history of 
the unions. 


Wilhelm admits that the fight is as 
much about solidarity as it is about con-
crete gains. The strike, which strategically 
exhibited the racial, economic, and educa-
tional diversity of the coalition, was orga-
nized precisely to prove that the alliance is 
still strong. "The reason that we set upon 
that strike strategy for that week was we felt 
that it was necessary to demonstrate to 
everyone at the University and in the com-
munity that all of Yale's predictions were 
wrong." he told me. "Nobody thought a 
week-long strike would settle things by 
itself, but we thought it was necessary to 
disprove all the bullshit." 


But according to Wilhelm, the strike 
was also organized to open a dialogue with 
the Uqjversity. The unions want the 
University to sit down with them and " 
bargain," as opposed to just making "pro-
nouncements." They want "give and take," 
"discussion and debate," and " ompro-
mise." 


The University, however, surely 
knows that to fall into that trap could allow 
for unprecedented union growth-some-
thing that it disagrees with not only on a 
theoretical level, with regard to the status of 
graduate students as employees, but on a 
practical level. Unlike most businesses, Yale 
does not have the luxury of relocating or 
selling itself. It cannot afford to be ham-
strung by its workers, who, as any adminis-
trator will tell you, do nor supply the key 
products that attract customers to Yale-
reaching and scholarship. Wilhelm under-
stands this. Still, he has hope: "We'll have 
to tty to persuade the University and put 
pressure on the University in whatever 
ways we can." 


The unions have little 
choice. If they don't take the long road, 
they face irrelevance-or, worse, extinc-
tion. 


J
OHN WILHELM DENIES THE RUMORS 
about his designs on the AFL-CIO 
presidency. When I asked him point-
blank whether he covets the office, he 
answered, "It's not a job I'm personally 
interested in." He would prefer someone 
younger, perhaps in the 40-to~o-year-old 
range, to ensure that his or her job would 
be a long-term post. That hasn't been the 
trend in recent AFL-CIO history-John 
Sweeney was 62 when elected, and Lane 
Kirkland, 
before him, was 57-but 
Wilhelm hopes that will change. The 
reports about the "palace coup," he claims, 
are greatly exaggerated. The way Wtlhelm


--- Page 21 ---

sees it, the Federation's power structure was 
reorganized to assist the president, and to 
help Sweeney and thus render the organiza-
tion as a whole more relevant and effective. 


Yet Wilhelm is no pushover. He wan ts 
the labor movement to change profoundly, 
and he remains the most vocal and most 
active force on this front in the country. In 
Wilhelm's ideal world, the labor movement 
will focus aJI of its efforts on organizing, 
politics, and growth. "I get impatient with 
the AFL-CIO as a whole," Wilhelm says." 
It has a history of trying to address aU the 
needs and concerns that exist in the labor 
movement . .. . My view is that if we don't 
put most of our resources into organizing 
and politics that supports organizing, then 
the labor movement, at least in its present 
institutional form, would be dead." I asked 
him whether he thought he could make 
that happen. H is answer was yes, but he 
hinted ominously that it might require 
some kind of "upheaval" or "new struc-
ture." 


Wilhelm doesn't see an end in sight for 
the tortuous contract negotiations between 
Yale and its unions. As the unions press 
even harder for collaboration, Yale seems to 
recoil even faster--despite its claim to want 
the very same thing. The University recent-
ly offered the unions an unprecedented 
ten-year contract, which was swiftly reject-
ed by negotiators on the grounds that it 
failed to offer a plan for cooperation and 
forced workers into too rigid a situation, 
one that could hurt people down the road 
when economic conditions inevitably 
change. This fight may well turn out to be 
one of Wilhelm's most difficult. It is hard 
to predict whether this will be a good or 
bad chapter in Wilhelm's life, or whether 
his ideafism will ultimately be a blessing or 
a curse, but at the very least, it will be a 
learning process. "Every struggle you 
engage in in life either sets you back or 
improves you," Wilhelm says. "I like to 
think that these kinds of struggles improve 
both me and others."

A student service organization goes national,
but continues to struggle at home
0
NE DAY LAST FALL, Charlie Johnson, a middle aged New
Havener who had relied on the government for subsis-
tence came to a realization: he simply couldn' t make it
on welfare. He couldn't communicate with his casew<?rker and
found the government bureaucracy so impersonal and slow-mov-
ing that it seemed more a hindrance than a benefit. "They' re
always condemning you and saying you're not doing nothing to
try to help yourself," he told me. "They're not really hearing
you." Like hundreds of people in New Haven cut off from federal
subsidies as a result of recent welfare reform, Johnson longed to
pull himself our of destitution, but was unsure how.

After holding a string of fleeting, low-paying jobs, he found
his way to the steps of 178 Temple Street on the advice of a flyer
he noticed at a homeless shelter. Here, he thought, was a chance
he might receive the help he needed. Inside the Temple Street
office, he spied a few armchairs, a shelf full of books and papers, a
fax machine, and a large sign on the wall: "Welcome to National
Studenr Partnerships."

National Student Partnerships (NSP) is a Yale undergraduate
organization with an uncommonly ambitious goal: to compensate
for a governmenr welfare system that it perceives to be an utter
failure. The group' s mission statemenr is "to ensure that all
Americans have access to the services, opportunities and attention
that they need in their pursuit of employment, self-sufficiency,
and personal success." In theory, NSP acts as a medium, connect-
ing clients with employers, housing authoriry, and healthcare
providers that would normally be out of reach. In acrualiry,
though, this process is far more complicated. NSP tries to improve
people' s lives, but ultimately reveals the frustrations and paradox-
es of trying to fix sociery &om the ground up.

National Student Partnerships was the brainchild of rwo
intrepid Yale students, Kirsten Lodal and Brian Kreiter. Midway
through their college careers, the rwo began to see their fellow stu-
dents in a new light, as the potential work force of an efficient ser-
vice organization. In November of 1998, they launched "NSP Kick
22.
Off" festivities, attracting 700 students and supporters, and rais-
ing almost $4,000 to offset start-up costs. NSP soon leased its first
office in New Haven, which was staffed by student volunteers. In
Lodal's eyes, altruistic Yalies seemed the perfect antidote to the ills
of government bureaucracy.

Today, proceedings remain informal in the one-room office,
whose carefully planned decor-from freshly painted blue walls to
complimentary coffee--fosters an atmosphere of laid-back profes-
sionalism. The students who work at the office are given a great
deal of autonomy and discretion when it comes to helping their
clients; each is expected to learn the client' s background and to
think creatively about how best to get him or her the necessary
services. The work is meant to be as unstructured as possible--a
perfect match for idealistic college students.

Success, NSP leaders say, is hard to define. Though the orga-
nization' s standards are high, student volunteers are obviously
limited in their capacities to achieve substantive gains for clients.
NSP counters this by valuing even the most minor accomplish-
ments, such as driving a person to a government office or consol-
ing them emotionally, because that is often the kind of work col-
lege students are most qualified to do. As Business Outreach
Coordinator Justin Loring put it, " The abiliry of a fresh perspec-
tive to find the answers to the problem or to motivate [a client] to
keep going is success in itself."

Coming from an organization that has attained national
prominence, this contentment with small victories is puzzling.
From September of 2.002. until February of this year-the months
ha.rdest on the poor and homeless-NSP's success rate was dubi-
ous: of the 2.8 people who sent in requests for education and job
training, only 13 people' s needs were met; of the 74 who applied
for housing, only 6 were rewarded; and of the 150 who sought
work, a paltry 14 had luck.

National Student Partnerships has a simple solution for its
shortcomings, however: expansion. After college, Lodal and
Kreiter worked vigorously to transform NSP into a national orga-

Revolution for Sale
Yale Stude~ts pay a visit to Castro's Cuba
T HAS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE THE IMAGE of a Stern-faced Fidel
Castro with his trademark beard and military fatigues has
reminded any American of immi.nent military threat. But any-
one who thinks the Cuban Revolution is a closed chapter in 20th-
century history books would find plenty to surprise them in con-
temporary Cuba, beginning with the billboards that greet visitors at
Jose Marti International Airport in Havana. The slogans-"44 years
of glory!" "With intelligence and perseverance, we will triumph!"
"In every neighborhood, Revolution!"-make a strong case chat the
Revolution is alive and kicking in Cuba. And anyone who wants to
understand what that means for the island's twelve million inhabi-
tants has taken on a challenge that is mammoth, if not downright
impossible.

The group of 16 Yalies with whom I traveled to Cuba this past
spring break knew that we would have to face this challenge. For
two months we had raised questions and qualms about the Cuban
revolution-focusing on environmental studies, medicine, architec-
ture, music, political science-in a student-designed anthropology
seminar. Now, in a plane over the Atlantic, my curiosity was tucked
neatly between the medical supplies and SPF-45 sunscreen in my
suitcase. We were finally on our way co the island for a firsthand
view of our class's nebulous subject matter

But in order to get this far, we had to sign on as political
tourists, to be shuttled between appointments with government
agencies, health clinics, and cultural houses. A governmem agency
with the suggestive title, "Cuban Institute for Friendship Among
Peoples" had created an itinerary for us according to our hazily
articulated interests, and a guide with a bus and driver awaited us
on the other side of customs. We were not the only group of
American college students spending their March vacation in Cuba:
groups from Cornell, Princeton, and the University of Illinois were
in Havana that week as well. Increased demand from the United
States has meant flights filled weekly with students, conference
attendees, and Cuban-Americans returning to visit family and
friends.

We stayed in the Vedado section of Havana, a luxurious neigh-
borhood stretching north to the Malec6n, Havana's seaside high-
way, and west towards the myriad alleyways and colonial architec-
ture of .Central and Old Havana. Vedado's quiet streets are lined
with the decaying mansions of Cuba's pre-Revolutionary glitterati.
The window panes on the houses are mostly broken now, and their
columns and balconies are crumbling, peeling, slowly relinquishing
their old-world gallantry to the thick island heat. Children play in
empty side streets off the main arteries of Lfnea and Paseo; old cars
and motorbikes with sidecars pass in isolated precessions. As far as
we could tell, traffic is almost unknown in today's gas-strapped
Cuba.

Even before the Revolution, Cuba held an almost mythic
appeal to American travelers. The opportunity to go there legally,
under the auspices of a Yale-sponsored Cuban studies program, had
brought to the surface my latent desire to explore untraditional
places, particularly one as rich in contradictions as Cuba. I knew the
limitations of what I could learn in a mere ten days: Still, I had lit-
de sense of the profound ambiguity presented by a government
both visionary and opportunistic-one that decries imperialism on
the one hand and bends over backwards to accommodate foreign
tourists on the other. Cuba today, we quickly learned, is a hall of
mirrors, a place from which visiting students are likely to leave with
little more than improved rhythm and a few boxes of Cuban cigars.

H
AVANA IS NOT AN EASY CITY TO GET TO KNOW. At times, it
seemed the city's inhabitants were finishing 01lt the ninth
inning of a long-decided baseball game, playing more out
of habit than conviction. The neglected buildings collapse at a rate
of more than one a day. Chalkboards listing ration allotments at
neighborhood distribution centers always have empty spaces next to
chicken, fish, and cigars. In the evenings, the exoticism of crowds
standing idly along the Malec6n conceals the boredom on the faces
of SO many young people. Without dollars, they cannot afford tO
hang out anywhere else.

The Cuba of the 8os must have presented a starkly different 
picture. In those days, the island received almost five billion dollars 
a year in subsidies from the Soviet Union. It was only with the col-
lapse of the Soviet bloc that the crisis Castro calls the Special Period 
began, spawning an exodus of desperate Cubans, many of whom 
captured headlines in the world press by trying tO reach Florida in 
homemade rafts. In 1994, eager to redress its currency crisis, the 
government legalized the use of the US dollar and launched a major 
effon to attract tourists to the island. Today, the island's economy is 
divided berween Cubans with access to dollars (those who work in 
the tourist industry or receive remittances from relatives abroad) 
and those reliant on meager peso salaries, usually worth fewer than 
$15 a month. For those with dollars, life's great delicacies are avail-
able in stores throughout the island. But for everyone else, nice 
clothes or an evening at one of Havana's trendy nightclubs, restau-rants, or hotels is far out of reach. 

For a generation of Cubans weaned on the promise of equali-
ty, the new social order must look a lot like betrayal. "The whole 
country js for the tourists," a 22-year-old guide in the Museo de Ia 
Revoluci6n told me indignantly. But she probably didn't want us to 
leave, either. My four-dollar museum ticket helped pay her salary, 
and she admitted that hers was a good job given the present econ-
omy. 

Still, our group was unavoidably implicated in the rransforma-
tive effect that tourists have had on contemporary Cuba. Despite 
our best efforts, it was proving impossible to conform to the 
tourist's mandate: take only photos, leave only foorprints. 
e University of Havana's campus is a regal grouping of pil-
ared buildings and stone steps situated on the border of 
Vedado and Central Havana. Berween classes, srudents flood 
the walkways, strolling together berween departments or lounging 
in the shade of the central courtyard. On one side of the plaza, 
though, the tree branches are cut back. In their place, the original 
steel tank in which Fidel entered Havana sits with its gun cast for-

ever at the ready. A plaque nearby com-
memorates the tank's historic role in the 
triumph of the Revolution 44 years ago. 
Our visit to the University marked an 
important juncture in our trip. While 
there, we heard a prominent professor of 
sociology explain life in Cuba with 
greater intellectual depth and 
ease than anyone we 
had met. ("We are eric-
ical of the Revolution," 
she told us. "But we are 
critical in ways that can 
help make a better soci-
ety. ") My assumption 
that Cuba's acceptance 
of the Revolution 
implied some measure 
of willful ignorance 
was dealt a crippling 
blow. 

Afterwards, 
I 
befriended some pass-
ing students from the 
University's language 
school, an especially popular department 
since jobs in the English-language tourist 
sector are among the most coveted in 
Cuba. Noel, Ali, Alberto, and James soon 
became our group's frequent companions. 
They seemed co relish the chance to tell us 
about Cuba and to practice their English, 
though they could not afford to accompa-
ny us to fine restaurants or discos. They 
could not even meet us on the lawn at the 
Hotel Nacional, the city's most prominent 
lodging, as most Cubans cannot approach 
the building unless accompanied by a for-
eign tourist. None of us knew how co 
respond to Noel and Ali's quiet indignation 
at being barred from the hotel. Generously, 
they did not ask us to. In fact, they apolo-
gized for the social hindrance that they 
posed. On our second-co-last night, a few 
of us finally convinced Noel and Ali to let 
us pay their way at a club. Inside, they 
shyly out-danced us and translated for us 
when a stand-up comedian rattled off jokes 
at lightning speed. We were, after all, still 
in their country; we just happened to be 
able to pay the entrance fee. 

The next day several members of our 
group bought University of Havana r-shirts 
at a store across the street from the school's 
historic front steps. Noel and Alberto 
laughed dryly at the irony. The Cuban 
Revolution had been a profound ideologi-
cal undertaking, intended co drive out the 
foreign mobsters and landowners, and 
complicit dictators who ran the country as 
though it were a giant casino. It was not 
intended 
to 
boost 
t-shirt 
sales. 
Revolutionary faithfuls justified this awk-
ward dichotomy by pointing out chat 
tourism was necessary to pull the country 
through temporary economic woes, woes 
which, as they never failed co point out, 
were exacerbated by the US blockade. As 
usual, I had little way of knowing whether 
the politicians actually believed what they 
told us. 

We spent most evenings at the guest-
house, where we spoke continuously about 
the credibility of the information we 
received each day. At times, I wondered 
how much of the support for the 
Revolution was contrived-a requisite for 
advancing professionally and avoiding 
notice by the authorities-and how much 
was well-reasoned and heartfelt. Even more 
confusing was the frequent reminder from 
government officials char, in face, criticism 
of the Revolution is welcome, as long as it 
is constructive. 
Fidel himself set 
the rule in a 1961 
speech: "Inside the 
Revolution, there 
is everything. 
Outside, 
nothing." In theory, 
Cubans can voice 
any critique short 
of advocating the 
overthrow of the 
government. But 
then, one doesn't 
need a Yale degree 
to know that the 
line between con-
structive criticism 
and complaints 
that carry 20-year 
jail terms is not likely to be set in stone. 
The only people free ro straddle the divide 
are the tourists. 



NO EXPERIENCE CONFUSED ME MORE 
than my visit to a Committee for 
the Defense of rhe Revolution 
(CDR) in the picturesque provincial town 
ofVifiales. CDR's are the most basic units 
of Cuba's complex system of governing 
bodies: since 1961, when the Bay of Pigs 
invasion and the collective anger of recent· 
ly departed exiles appeared to threaten the 
revolmionary government each neighbor· 
hood in the country has been organized 
into a CDR. 

The director of the CDR in Vifiales 
was an elderly woman in bright blue shores 
and tank top. She energetically explained 
to us chat her CDR is mostly concerned 
with block parties ana guard duf}'· 
Everyone who is able must patrol at least



one night a month-women from n:oo PM 
to x:oo AM, men from I:oo to 5:00AM. 
"They look for people who aren't from 
here and ask them what they're doing," she 
explained, adding that in a small commu-
nity like theirs spotting outsiders wasn't 
rough. Glancing around at our pale-faced 
group of Reef-clad Yalies, I decided that 
they must have turned off the alarm bells 
for the evening. 

The festivities marking our visit began 
abruptly, but before joining in the revelry, I 
had a few more questions for the director. 
She had said membership in the CDR was 
voluntary, but I wondered if there was any-
one in the town who had opted not to join. 
"No, everyone joins when they are 14,'' 
she explained with a kind smile. 

She mentioned that elections for lead-
ership of the CDR are held every three 
years, and anyone can be selected. "How 
long have you been the head?" I asked. She 
beamed proudly: "42 years!" "She is always 
re-elected by everyone," a lady standing 
nearby added. Finally catching on, I smiled 
obligingly. 



C
UBA HAS CONTINUED TO ELUDE ME 
even after my return to the US. Back 
in Miami, I visited the office of the 
Cuban-American National Foundation 
and wandered through Little Havana, 
Miami Cubans' capitalist reincarnation of 
the island they left behind. Here the vitri-
olic anti-Castro rhetoric, the signs con-
demning the Clinton administration for 
returning Elran Gonzalez, and the monu-
ment to the "martyrs" of the Bay of Pigs 
invasion struck a familiar chord. The 
numerous daily articles in the Nuevo 
Herald about human rights abuses and 
righteous exile efforts to stop them, 
cemented the argument I had often heard 
defensive Cubans spout: Americans don't 
have a lock on objectivity either. 

Still, the news that emerged from 
Cuba in the following weeks stung. Within 
days of our departure, dozens of indepen-
dent journalists, economists, and alleged 
dissidents were rounded up from across the 
island by the authorities. The second week 
of April, several of them received sentences 
ranging from 20 to 27 years in prison, often 
preceded by trials of no more than a day. 
The headlines reminded me of my friends 
at the University of Havana, and what they 
had told me about the difficulties faced by 
students who refuse to march in govern-
ment-organized demonstrations or join 
Communist youth organizations, and 
about their isolation as intellectual dissi-
dents. 

"You hear things from other students," 
Noel had rold us, "about small protests in 
outlying towns or the deaths of people who 
tried to escape through Guantanamo-but 
nothing is ever reported." 

For myself as well, any lesson on mod-
ern day Cuba would be fragmentary at 
best. I was, after all, still in their country; I 
just happened to be able to pay the 
entrance fee.

N Areopagitica MILTON FAMOUSLY WROTE, "Who kills a man kills 
a reasonable creature, God's image; but he who destroys a good 
book, kills reason itself, kills the image of God, as it were in the 
eye." These words, from the poet's invective against 17TH-century 
England's oppressive censorship laws, elevate books--or at least, 
"good" books-to something far r-----------------------, Human Stain, as well as in the theoreti-
grander than repositories of know!-
edge, something with a "life-blood" 
and a pulse, something that, like us, 
can die. There is something appealing, 
even seductive, about the idea of a text 
as a living being. It invites a kind of 
identification between the reader and 
the written word that holds all the 
promise of a new life, a new person to 
discover. 

In her book The Holocaust of Texts: 
Genocide, Literature, and 
Personification, Amy Hungerford, an 
assistant professor of English at Yale, 
explores the implications of texts as 
persons, or, personified texts through 
the lens of post-World War II literature, in particular, literature that deals 
with the legacy of the Holocaust. Over 
the last three decades, Hungerford 
claims, critics and readers have begun 
to regard books as embodiments of 
individual lives and even entire cultures. Viewed in these terms, the 
destruction of a text becomes not simply murder, but genocide. 

Hungerford rejects this "confla-
gration of text and person," but nonetheless acknowledges that the personification of texts has shaped our 
contemporary understanding of identity, genocide, and the ability 
of language to represent these concepts adequately. Regardless of 
whether a novel addresses these issues directly, how we perceive it is 
colored by our insistence on identifying people as members of specific racial or cultural groups-Jewish, black, female, Indian, 
Catholic, etc. In this context, a personified text assumes an identity in keeping with our notions of group classification. Hungerford 
perceives this way of thinking and reading as peculiarly postmodern. She weighs its consequences in works as diverse as Sylvia Plath's 
poem "Daddy," Art Spiegelman's Maus and Philip Roth's The 
Human Stain, as well as in the theoretical musings of critics such as Jacques 
Derrida, Paul de Man, and Jacqueline 
Rose. Hungerford debunks the presumed benefits of multiculturalism, 
namely, the assumption that a person's 
experience possesses value because of his 
or her identification with a specific cultural group-asserting that this mindset 
is both absurd and restrictive. She 
applies this thesis with penetrating 
astuteness, despite occasional lapses into 
the dense and at times impenetrable 
ruminations that characterize so much 
postmodern literary criticism. But if The 
Holocaust of Texts is typical of contemporary literary theory in this respect, the 
questions it raises are anything but ordinary. 

Hungerford demonstrates the distorting effect of personifying texts most 
effectively in her examination of critical 
reactions to Plath's "Daddy." The poem's 
speaker, an unidentified woman, 
invokes Hitler's persecution of Jews as 
an analogy to her relationship with her 
tyrannical father, explicitly identifying 
her suffering with that of Holocaust victims. Since "Daddy's" publication, readers and critics alike have decried Plath, who is neither Jewish nor a 
Holocaust survivor, for what they believe to be a shameless exploitation 
of a highly personal event. These critics demand a biographical 
connection between Plath and her writing, one that effectively limits 
the scope of her poetry to the scope of her personal experiences. 
Hungerford disagrees: With a nod to the New Critics, she rejects 
biographically influenced readings, eschewing the question "Who 
was Sylvia Plath?" in favor of "Who is Plath's writing?" With the 
poem freed from the constraints of authorial biography, the text 
itself reveals answers to identity questions-it is "both a Jewish survivor and a woman" because its language identifies with both of 
these groups. The poem has been elevated to the status of person-
hood only to be constrained by the narrow categories of "Jewish" 
and "female." The poem's personification invites the same restrictions that biographical critics imposed on Plath. As soon as it is perceived as a person, the poem loses its autonomy as a work of art 
independent of its author. 

But if personification limits Plath's poetry in undesirable ways, 
as Hungerford suggests, the consequences are even more dire when 
the text presents itself as non-fiction, as in the case of Art 
Spiegelman's Maus. Maus, a Pulitzer Prize-winning comic, chronicles 
the survival story of Spiegelman's father, using animal heads to 
depict human characters, with mouse heads for Jews and cat heads 
for Nazis. For Hungerford, this kind of representation is predictably 
repellant. Not only does it define individuals along cultural lines via 
animal heads, but these cultural identities perpetuate the legacy of 
the Holocaust. "All persons in the present," Hungerford writes, "are 
in effect identified in relation to the Holocaust ... rather than in 
relation to some other source of identity in the present." All of 
Spiegelman's characters, regardless of their personal experiences, are 
portrayed in terms of a single historical event. The author depicts 
himself as a mouse, not because he is Jewish, but because he is the 
descendent of a Jewish Holocaust survivor. The past permeates and 
defines Spiegelman's present, identifying characters with a kind of 
chilling determinism and suggesting that we will never step out of 
history's shadow. The story of Maus, then, becomes as much 
Spiegelman's as his father's. He, too, is a survivor, and the text of 
Maus is an embodiment of that survival. 

Surprisingly, Hungerford finds support for her rejection of 
identity politics in the fiction of Saul Bellow and Philip Roth. 
Whereas critics have traditionally discussed these authors in terms 
of their status as Jewish Americans, Hungerford, in a radical reinterpretation, heralds them as champions of liberated identity. In her 
view, their fiction breaks free of all constraints imposed by culture, 
family, tribe, religion, or history. To cite one example, in 
Hungerford's reading of Roth's novel The Human Stain, Coleman 
Silk, a black man who passes himself off as a white Jew, manages to 
"resist identity categorization in a very particular way." By concealing 
his cultural background, Silk maintains a vital separateness, 
making his identity "secret" and "absolutely particular." Given the 
prevalence of Jewish protagonists and the emphasis on ethnicity in 
Roth's novels, Hungerford's claim that Jewish identity, and in a 
larger sense, cultural identity, is secondary to "personal particularity" seems at best refreshing and at worst contrived. The notion that 
we are all at core dissimilar is appealing, but its presence in Roth's 
fiction still seems somewhat dubious. 

Ultimately, Hungerford argues convincingly against the seduction 
of the personified text. The quality that makes it so appealing-namely, the desire to experience another person, another identity, by experiencing the text-is exactly what constrains both post-
modern literature and literary theory. When the personal is bound 
by the restraints of multicultural categorization and the legacy of 
history, identity and capacity for creative thought suffer. By rejecting 
these narrow limitations we embrace a freer, albeit lonelier, conception of ourselves. We can never truly share the experience of 
another living being, whether that being is conceived as a person or 
a personified text, because in the end, we are unique, "particular all 
the way down." In exchange for relinquishing our fantasy of the living text, we are given back our imagination.

**Title: Trooper One**
**Author: Concha Mendoza**
**Page number(s): 30**

"Every game you play, every night you 
stay, I'll be watching you." Twenty-
four hours a day the police-the 
Connecticut State Police, that is-sends 
out a similar message to terrorists. Since 
July 2001, the department's Bell 407 has 
patrolled the skies watching for terrorists 
while keeping an eye on civilian activity. 
The helicopter is a monument of American 
strength, power, and extravagance. For the 
bargain price of $2.3 billion, Connecticut 
taxpayers have stocked up on terrorist-
stomping technology in a single helicopter: 
Trooper One. But fear not New Haven, 
this one chopper show is equipped with 
some of the freshest gadgets in aviation 
technology. 

Steve Sampson, a Trooper One pilot-
in-training, knows all the jewels hidden in 
this terror-fighting machine. Its wire strikers come in handy during drug busts. They 
are crucial for slashing those low-hanging 
copter-flipping wires strung over marijuana 
fields. The helicopter's two cameras offer a 
cure for the "It Wasn't Me" syndrome common to hit-and-run drivers. The craft's 
Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) scanner 
once spotted a man standing half-sub-
merged in a freezing river, only a few hundred 
feet from where he had hidden a 
stolen (and subsequently totaled) car. 
Sampson explained that with the help of a 
Global Positioning System, state police 
once tracked down the abode of an "intoxicated gentleman" who, in a modified game 
of whack-a-mole, would "pop out of his 
house and shoot off a couple of rounds," 
then disappear back inside. The helicopter, 
using its infrared scanner identified the 
man's final popping place, enabling ground 
police to promptly restrain him. 

Armed with the necessary equipment, 
Trooper One is an eager watchdog with a 
sharp bite-but not always a good eye. 
Shortly after September 11, 2001, the blue 
and yellow helicopter investigated a suspicious case, in which two men in a law office 
parking garage were spotted carrying 
"sniper rifles." With the help of a FLIR 
scanner and a Microwave Data Downlink 
system, Trooper One used the men's body 
heat to pinpoint their location. Troopers 
stormed the garage, startling two cameramen with tripods in their hands. 

Another red herring led Sampson to a 
"very suspicious" un-lit boat floating 
underneath Gold Star Bridge at midnight. 
Sampson alerted the Coast Guard, who 
discovered that the boat's occupants were 
just a couple of guys out fishing. The helicopter has helped bring down suspicious 
aircraft, intercepting six so far. Sampson 
explains that, similar to a highway patrol 
car, the helicopter signals for the offending 
craft to land, then follows them down to 
earth. Unfortunately, in every instance so 
far, the pilots have been unaware that they 
were flying in restricted areas. And one has 
to wonder: Do terrorists respond to hand 
signals? 

With the inception of the war in Iraq 
and the heightened terror alert, the helicopter has turned its attention to hunting 
terrorists, and has given a back seat to the 
unrelated "flood of calls" received by the 
Aviation Unit. Everyday, Trooper One performs a routine infrastructure check. It 
zooms over power plants, the U.S. Navy 
submarine and military base, Pfizer's 
research facility in Groton, airports, major 
cities, and bridges, primarily the Gold Star 
Bridge in New London and the Pearl 
Harbor Memorial Bridge in New Haven. 

As a part of "Operation Liberty Shield," 
five National Guard Black Hawk helicopters have joined up with Trooper One 
to patrol Connecticut skies twenty-four 
hours a day. 

Despite the helicopter's recent success 
in tracking down a drug dealer on the run 
and locating two lost nine-year-old girls via 
the signals from their toy store walkie 
talkies, the community has expressed some 
doubt as to whether the helicopter is an 
efficient use of state money. With extensive 
budget cuts, $1,000 per flight hour seems 
excessive, given the lack of terrorist threats 
averted thus far. 

However, many states look 
to Connecticut's aviation program as a prototype. Nevada has already purchased a helicopter similar to Trooper One, and the 
New York Police Department has also 
shown interest. Sampson welcomes to the 
station citizens who want to learn more 
about the mysterious helicopter they see 
flying around. He feels it is important to 
inform people about exactly what their 
money is buying. When someone gawks at 
its extremely high price, Sampson has a 
ready reply: "You can't put a price on life." 

Though the unlucky cameraman who 
was mistaken as a sniper might not agree, 
the pilot has a good point. For the rest of 
us, when the terrorist warning reaches 
super-bright hunter orange, we will be able 
to look into the sky and feel comforted to 
know that Trooper One is watching over us 
as we mow our lawns.
