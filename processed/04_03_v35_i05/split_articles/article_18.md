The Cuba of the 8os must have presented a starkly different 
picture. In those days, the island received almost five billion dollars 
a year in subsidies from the Soviet Union. It was only with the col-
lapse of the Soviet bloc that the crisis Castro calls the Special Period 
began, spawning an exodus of desperate Cubans, many of whom 
captured headlines in the world press by trying tO reach Florida in 
homemade rafts. In 1994, eager to redress its currency crisis, the 
government legalized the use of the US dollar and launched a major 
effon to attract tourists to the island. Today, the island's economy is 
divided berween Cubans with access to dollars (those who work in 
the tourist industry or receive remittances from relatives abroad) 
and those reliant on meager peso salaries, usually worth fewer than 
$15 a month. For those with dollars, life's great delicacies are avail-
able in stores throughout the island. But for everyone else, nice 
clothes or an evening at one of Havana's trendy nightclubs, restau-rants, or hotels is far out of reach. 

For a generation of Cubans weaned on the promise of equali-
ty, the new social order must look a lot like betrayal. "The whole 
country js for the tourists," a 22-year-old guide in the Museo de Ia 
Revoluci6n told me indignantly. But she probably didn't want us to 
leave, either. My four-dollar museum ticket helped pay her salary, 
and she admitted that hers was a good job given the present econ-
omy. 

Still, our group was unavoidably implicated in the rransforma-
tive effect that tourists have had on contemporary Cuba. Despite 
our best efforts, it was proving impossible to conform to the 
tourist's mandate: take only photos, leave only foorprints. 
e University of Havana's campus is a regal grouping of pil-
ared buildings and stone steps situated on the border of 
Vedado and Central Havana. Berween classes, srudents flood 
the walkways, strolling together berween departments or lounging 
in the shade of the central courtyard. On one side of the plaza, 
though, the tree branches are cut back. In their place, the original 
steel tank in which Fidel entered Havana sits with its gun cast for-

ever at the ready. A plaque nearby com-
memorates the tank's historic role in the 
triumph of the Revolution 44 years ago. 
Our visit to the University marked an 
important juncture in our trip. While 
there, we heard a prominent professor of 
sociology explain life in Cuba with 
greater intellectual depth and 
ease than anyone we 
had met. ("We are eric-
ical of the Revolution," 
she told us. "But we are 
critical in ways that can 
help make a better soci-
ety. ") My assumption 
that Cuba's acceptance 
of the Revolution 
implied some measure 
of willful ignorance 
was dealt a crippling 
blow. 

Afterwards, 
I 
befriended some pass-
ing students from the 
University's language 
school, an especially popular department 
since jobs in the English-language tourist 
sector are among the most coveted in 
Cuba. Noel, Ali, Alberto, and James soon 
became our group's frequent companions. 
They seemed co relish the chance to tell us 
about Cuba and to practice their English, 
though they could not afford to accompa-
ny us to fine restaurants or discos. They 
could not even meet us on the lawn at the 
Hotel Nacional, the city's most prominent 
lodging, as most Cubans cannot approach 
the building unless accompanied by a for-
eign tourist. None of us knew how co 
respond to Noel and Ali's quiet indignation 
at being barred from the hotel. Generously, 
they did not ask us to. In fact, they apolo-
gized for the social hindrance that they 
posed. On our second-co-last night, a few 
of us finally convinced Noel and Ali to let 
us pay their way at a club. Inside, they 
shyly out-danced us and translated for us 
when a stand-up comedian rattled off jokes 
at lightning speed. We were, after all, still 
in their country; we just happened to be 
able to pay the entrance fee. 

The next day several members of our 
group bought University of Havana r-shirts 
at a store across the street from the school's 
historic front steps. Noel and Alberto 
laughed dryly at the irony. The Cuban 
Revolution had been a profound ideologi-
cal undertaking, intended co drive out the 
foreign mobsters and landowners, and 
complicit dictators who ran the country as 
though it were a giant casino. It was not 
intended 
to 
boost 
t-shirt 
sales. 
Revolutionary faithfuls justified this awk-
ward dichotomy by pointing out chat 
tourism was necessary to pull the country 
through temporary economic woes, woes 
which, as they never failed co point out, 
were exacerbated by the US blockade. As 
usual, I had little way of knowing whether 
the politicians actually believed what they 
told us. 

We spent most evenings at the guest-
house, where we spoke continuously about 
the credibility of the information we 
received each day. At times, I wondered 
how much of the support for the 
Revolution was contrived-a requisite for 
advancing professionally and avoiding 
notice by the authorities-and how much 
was well-reasoned and heartfelt. Even more 
confusing was the frequent reminder from 
government officials char, in face, criticism 
of the Revolution is welcome, as long as it 
is constructive. 
Fidel himself set 
the rule in a 1961 
speech: "Inside the 
Revolution, there 
is everything. 
Outside, 
nothing." In theory, 
Cubans can voice 
any critique short 
of advocating the 
overthrow of the 
government. But 
then, one doesn't 
need a Yale degree 
to know that the 
line between con-
structive criticism 
and complaints 
that carry 20-year 
jail terms is not likely to be set in stone. 
The only people free ro straddle the divide 
are the tourists. 



NO EXPERIENCE CONFUSED ME MORE 
than my visit to a Committee for 
the Defense of rhe Revolution 
(CDR) in the picturesque provincial town 
ofVifiales. CDR's are the most basic units 
of Cuba's complex system of governing 
bodies: since 1961, when the Bay of Pigs 
invasion and the collective anger of recent· 
ly departed exiles appeared to threaten the 
revolmionary government each neighbor· 
hood in the country has been organized 
into a CDR. 

The director of the CDR in Vifiales 
was an elderly woman in bright blue shores 
and tank top. She energetically explained 
to us chat her CDR is mostly concerned 
with block parties ana guard duf}'· 
Everyone who is able must patrol at least



one night a month-women from n:oo PM 
to x:oo AM, men from I:oo to 5:00AM. 
"They look for people who aren't from 
here and ask them what they're doing," she 
explained, adding that in a small commu-
nity like theirs spotting outsiders wasn't 
rough. Glancing around at our pale-faced 
group of Reef-clad Yalies, I decided that 
they must have turned off the alarm bells 
for the evening. 

The festivities marking our visit began 
abruptly, but before joining in the revelry, I 
had a few more questions for the director. 
She had said membership in the CDR was 
voluntary, but I wondered if there was any-
one in the town who had opted not to join. 
"No, everyone joins when they are 14,'' 
she explained with a kind smile. 

She mentioned that elections for lead-
ership of the CDR are held every three 
years, and anyone can be selected. "How 
long have you been the head?" I asked. She 
beamed proudly: "42 years!" "She is always 
re-elected by everyone," a lady standing 
nearby added. Finally catching on, I smiled 
obligingly. 



C
UBA HAS CONTINUED TO ELUDE ME 
even after my return to the US. Back 
in Miami, I visited the office of the 
Cuban-American National Foundation 
and wandered through Little Havana, 
Miami Cubans' capitalist reincarnation of 
the island they left behind. Here the vitri-
olic anti-Castro rhetoric, the signs con-
demning the Clinton administration for 
returning Elran Gonzalez, and the monu-
ment to the "martyrs" of the Bay of Pigs 
invasion struck a familiar chord. The 
numerous daily articles in the Nuevo 
Herald about human rights abuses and 
righteous exile efforts to stop them, 
cemented the argument I had often heard 
defensive Cubans spout: Americans don't 
have a lock on objectivity either. 

Still, the news that emerged from 
Cuba in the following weeks stung. Within 
days of our departure, dozens of indepen-
dent journalists, economists, and alleged 
dissidents were rounded up from across the 
island by the authorities. The second week 
of April, several of them received sentences 
ranging from 20 to 27 years in prison, often 
preceded by trials of no more than a day. 
The headlines reminded me of my friends 
at the University of Havana, and what they 
had told me about the difficulties faced by 
students who refuse to march in govern-
ment-organized demonstrations or join 
Communist youth organizations, and 
about their isolation as intellectual dissi-
dents. 

"You hear things from other students," 
Noel had rold us, "about small protests in 
outlying towns or the deaths of people who 
tried to escape through Guantanamo-but 
nothing is ever reported." 

For myself as well, any lesson on mod-
ern day Cuba would be fragmentary at 
best. I was, after all, still in their country; I 
just happened to be able to pay the 
entrance fee.
