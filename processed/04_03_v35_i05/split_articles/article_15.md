Nobody thought a week-long_ strike would 
settle things bJ itself, but we thought it was 
necessarv to disprove all that bullshit. 
Wilhelm negotiated a contract for Local 34 
that increased wages by more than 20 per-
cent for its traditionally underpaid female 
workforce. Later, Local 35 received a con-
tract as well-one that Wilhelm considers 
the best in the union's history. 


The organizers held a jubilant celebra-
tion in Center Church on the New Haven 
Green, where they praised Wilhelm's work. 
The press heralded the settlement and 
overall organizing drive as a watershed 
moment in labor history, a time of 
unprecedented success for female and 
minority workers in the expanding service 
sector. One member of Local 34 raved to 
Th~ Ntw York Tim~ about Wtlhelm, "He's 
interested in everybody as a person, not 
just a number. I would trust him with the 
lives of my kids. That's how I feel about 
him." Wilhelm, for his part, down plays his 
leadership during the strike. "I certainly 
played a role in it," he told me, "and I'm 
proud of my role in it, but that was a vic-
tory of literally hundreds of people. You 
can't win something like that without a lot 
of people deciding, 'I'm going to be a 
leader."' He prefers instead to talk about 
what he got from it all: "That was a very, 
very wonderful learning experience for 
me-an inspirational experience." Indeed, 
Wilhelm was just getting started. 


W 
H.EN I MET WILHELM at a coffee 
shop several weeks after March's 
busy five-day strike, he casually 
tossed around the buzzwords that have 
made him famous in recent years: 
"respect," "partnership," "cooperation," 
"give and take." Since his promotion from 
leader of Local 35 to Western Regional 
Director of HEREIU and then to the 
AI>RJL 2003 
Presidency of HEREIU he has broken the 
mold of union leaders who antagonize 
CEOs. 


Many, 
including 
Yale 
President 
Richard Levin, still paint Wilhelm's ideolo-
gy as a front for more insidious interests. 
But out West in the desert, where Wilhelm 
started working in 1987, he proved that it is 
more than just talk. In Las Vegas, where he 
helped initiate one of the biggest organiz-
ing campaigns of the 20TH century, he 
devised a novel strategy of enlisting promi-
nent casino and hotel owners to fight other 
owners who were giving unions a hard 
time. He went straight to the big guys: 
Steve Wynn, the owner of the Bellagio, and 
Terri Lanni, CEO of the MGM Grand, 
were recruited to aid in two bitter, but suc-
cessful strikes in the early 90s, one of which 
lasted over six years. In a 2002 speech, 
President Bush's Director of the Office of 
Personnel Management, Kay Cole James, 
praised WUhelm's approach, saying she 
wanted "everyone to see the incredible way 
this union leader and casino manager work 
together. It was just incredible. John 
Wilhelm . . . and Terry Lanni .... Both of 
these guys are tough. It was interesting to 
me that, in the midst of negotiations, when 
their issue and their industry came under 
attack, those guys locked arms." 


Wilhelm has also sought alliances with 
political leaders, even those on the opposite 
side of the fence. He is reported to consort 
with a vast array of in.Buential figures, 
including New York Governor George 
Pataki, former Mexican Foreign Minister 
Jorge Castaiieda, and Connecticut Senator 
Joseph Lieberman (whose first state senate 
bid was co-organized by WUhelm's mentor, 
Vinny Sirabella). When pressed on how 
these relationships have helped his cause, 
he demured, saying that sometimes politi-
cal leaders can be valuable strategically, but 
that " there's no real political influence 
based on personal relationships with politi-
cians. 


Republican SenatOr John Ensign 
from Nevada tells a different story. In a 
speech given at the Teamsters Union 2001 
Convention, he outlined how WUhelm 
once influenced his vote on an important 
UniOn ISSUeS: 

Initially, you know, my party was 
for the Paycheck Protection Act and 
most people in my party still are. 
But ... John Wilhelm, because he 
had a relationship with me, he came 
and he talked to me about how this 
was really a states' rights issue. This 
should be left up to each state, and 
each state individually. So as a US 
Senator, we should not vote for any 
kind of paycheck protection. It was 
because of that relationship that he 
had with me that I sat down, he 
convinced me of it, and it was pret-
ty easy to support him in that effort 
and the rest of the union movement 
in that effort. 


In the early 90s, Wilhelm returned to 
negotiate another contentious contract 
with the tools he had sharpened in Las 
Vegas. But New Haven is not Las Vegas, 
and Wilhelm found it difficult to apply his 
tactics. The Yale administration, led by 
newly hired President Richard Levin, had 
little interest in working with the unions, 
or at least in working with them on their 
terms. Wilhelm calls this "fuck-you time, 
again" -a period marked by active disre-
gard for honest bargaining on the part of 
the University. He does nor understand

how a University so focused on intellectual 
debate could be so averse to treating its 
employees as equals worthy of collabora-
tion. "Ironically, I couldn't Â·learn anything 
about genuine labor-management coopera-
tion in the best interests of employers and 
workers at Yale," he told me. "But some-
how I learned volumes about it in Las 
Vegas." 


For its part, the University has in 
recent years adopted some of the catch-
phrases that WUhelrn champions as his 
own." . Last 
spring, 
Levin 
announced, "We are eager to work with 
Locals 34 and 35 to find a new way of struc-
turing our relationship, relying on day-to-
day collaboration rather than periodic con-
frontation." But no action followed. 


Despite using the S3.1Jle rhetoric, all that the 
unions and management have achieved at 
this point _is one expired contract and a 
week-long strike. 


ITH THE ADMINISTRATIONS DOORS 
closed, Wilhelm moved on to new 
strategies. He advocated fostering 
inclusion not only with employers, but 
within unions themselves. In the late 90s, 
he focused his efforts on an issue tradition-
ally ignored in labor movement politics: 
the working rights of immigrants, both 
legal and illegal, and of minorities overall. 


At the AFL-CIO convention of 1999, 
Wilhelm lobbied for the federation to rec-
ognize the rights of illegal immigrants to 
organize. The issue was tabled, but 
John 
Sweeney 
appointed 
WUhelm chair of a new committee to 
explore the issue further. WUhelrn used the 
position to engineer another unexpected 
victory. After his committee voted unani-
mously to reject the AFL-CIO's hostile pol-
icy on illegal immigrants, the Federation's 
executive council did the same in 2000. 


It was a stunning move by an organi-
zation that had historically viewed illegal 
immigrants as obstacles to its own mem-
bership's well-being. It was also a welcome 
PR move for HEREIU, which, despite hav-
ing done a great deal of progressive orga-
nizing. was still considered one of the most 
corrupt and least visionary unions in the 
country. The union's largest local, in Las 
Vegas, had been in cahoots with the infa-
mous gangster Bugsy Siegel in the 40s, 
while the founder of that local is said to 
20 
have been shot to death and abandoned 
naked in the desert. The last president of 
HEREIU, Edward Hanley, was ushered 
out of office by allegations of ties to 
Chicago 
mobsters, and even when 
Wuhelm took over in 1998, the Justice 
Department kept close tabs on his admin-
istration. 


With the Justice Department on their 
backs, progressive organizing was sweet 
relief for Wilhelm and the union. This 
highly pragmatic strategy was aimed both 
at bringing more bodies to the union and 
in fostering strong bonds among existing 
members. "When unions don't reach out, 
they are inherently unable to represent 
their members properly," he told me. 
"When unions .look narrowly at a group of 
employees working for an employer, they 
don't think about the fact that those 
employees are not just workers-they're 
parts of communities, they belong to 
churches." 


In the summer of 2001, Wilhelm took 
another step toward transforming the 
American labor movement. After traveling 
to Mexico to meet with Mexican Foreign 
Minister Jorge Castaneda to discuss illegal 
workers in the United States, he persuaded 
Castafieda to speak at the HEREIU annu-
al convention. It was the first time that an 
American union had conversed seriously 
with a foreign government about labor 
issues. 


In this context, the recent union strife 
at Yale-already forgotten by many-has 
been decisive for Wilhelm's plan to change 
the labor movement. The partnership 
between Locals 34 and 35, the Graduate 
Employees and Students Organization 
(GESO), and the Yale-New Haven 
Hospital workers is a serious test of 
Wilhelm's unique brand of unionism. It 
represents the ultimate motley crew: loyal 
custodial, clerical, and technical workers; 
educated graduate students who will leave 
campus after seven years; and poor, unor-
ganized hospital workers. So far, the 
alliance has held, but it hasn't yielded any 
substantive gains in terms of organizing or 
contracts. GESO and the hospital workers 
are still out in the cold, while Locals 34 and 
35's contract negotiations have been some 
of the most unproductive in the history of 
the unions. 


Wilhelm admits that the fight is as 
much about solidarity as it is about con-
crete gains. The strike, which strategically 
exhibited the racial, economic, and educa-
tional diversity of the coalition, was orga-
nized precisely to prove that the alliance is 
still strong. "The reason that we set upon 
that strike strategy for that week was we felt 
that it was necessary to demonstrate to 
everyone at the University and in the com-
munity that all of Yale's predictions were 
wrong." he told me. "Nobody thought a 
week-long strike would settle things by 
itself, but we thought it was necessary to 
disprove all the bullshit." 


But according to Wilhelm, the strike 
was also organized to open a dialogue with 
the Uqjversity. The unions want the 
University to sit down with them and " 
bargain," as opposed to just making "pro-
nouncements." They want "give and take," 
"discussion and debate," and " ompro-
mise." 


The University, however, surely 
knows that to fall into that trap could allow 
for unprecedented union growth-some-
thing that it disagrees with not only on a 
theoretical level, with regard to the status of 
graduate students as employees, but on a 
practical level. Unlike most businesses, Yale 
does not have the luxury of relocating or 
selling itself. It cannot afford to be ham-
strung by its workers, who, as any adminis-
trator will tell you, do nor supply the key 
products that attract customers to Yale-
reaching and scholarship. Wilhelm under-
stands this. Still, he has hope: "We'll have 
to tty to persuade the University and put 
pressure on the University in whatever 
ways we can." 


The unions have little 
choice. If they don't take the long road, 
they face irrelevance-or, worse, extinc-
tion. 


J
OHN WILHELM DENIES THE RUMORS 
about his designs on the AFL-CIO 
presidency. When I asked him point-
blank whether he covets the office, he 
answered, "It's not a job I'm personally 
interested in." He would prefer someone 
younger, perhaps in the 40-to~o-year-old 
range, to ensure that his or her job would 
be a long-term post. That hasn't been the 
trend in recent AFL-CIO history-John 
Sweeney was 62 when elected, and Lane 
Kirkland, 
before him, was 57-but 
Wilhelm hopes that will change. The 
reports about the "palace coup," he claims, 
are greatly exaggerated. The way Wtlhelm


--- Page 21 ---

sees it, the Federation's power structure was 
reorganized to assist the president, and to 
help Sweeney and thus render the organiza-
tion as a whole more relevant and effective. 


Yet Wilhelm is no pushover. He wan ts 
the labor movement to change profoundly, 
and he remains the most vocal and most 
active force on this front in the country. In 
Wilhelm's ideal world, the labor movement 
will focus aJI of its efforts on organizing, 
politics, and growth. "I get impatient with 
the AFL-CIO as a whole," Wilhelm says." 
It has a history of trying to address aU the 
needs and concerns that exist in the labor 
movement . .. . My view is that if we don't 
put most of our resources into organizing 
and politics that supports organizing, then 
the labor movement, at least in its present 
institutional form, would be dead." I asked 
him whether he thought he could make 
that happen. H is answer was yes, but he 
hinted ominously that it might require 
some kind of "upheaval" or "new struc-
ture." 


Wilhelm doesn't see an end in sight for 
the tortuous contract negotiations between 
Yale and its unions. As the unions press 
even harder for collaboration, Yale seems to 
recoil even faster--despite its claim to want 
the very same thing. The University recent-
ly offered the unions an unprecedented 
ten-year contract, which was swiftly reject-
ed by negotiators on the grounds that it 
failed to offer a plan for cooperation and 
forced workers into too rigid a situation, 
one that could hurt people down the road 
when economic conditions inevitably 
change. This fight may well turn out to be 
one of Wilhelm's most difficult. It is hard 
to predict whether this will be a good or 
bad chapter in Wilhelm's life, or whether 
his ideafism will ultimately be a blessing or 
a curse, but at the very least, it will be a 
learning process. "Every struggle you 
engage in in life either sets you back or 
improves you," Wilhelm says. "I like to 
think that these kinds of struggles improve 
both me and others."
