whom do not have air conditioning, will be 
opening their windows wide and breathing 
in even dirtier air. Meanwhile, English 
Station's energy will be traveling on high 
speed power lines straight out of Fair 
Haven to Great Gatsby mansions on Long 
Island and country estates in Fairfield 
County. "It is clearly not fair by any stretch 
of the imagination," Mitchell said. 

While it might be true that Fair Haven 
residents use less energy for air condition-
ing, to claim that English Station is sub-
jecting the poor people of Fair Haven to 
harm for the sake of the rich seems arbi-
trary. In the end, English Station is no dif-
ferent than any of the other industries cur-
rently operating in Fair Haven. Residents 
will bear the brunt of the harm associated 
with plants that serve people elsewhere. 

Art Rocque has two options. He can 
follow his job description and "well and 
faithfUlly enforce the law" or he can use 
discretion and invoke a footnote for the 
sake of the community. If Rocque simply 
enforces, QE will be granted its permit and 
start operating as construction begins on 
the neighboring school. 

Could this little dinosaur of a power 
plant eclipse one of Fair Haven's greatest 
success stories in 30 years? Perhaps. But 
who would shoulder the blame? The DEP 
is 
enforcing 
the laws; 
the 
School 
Construction Project could not find a bet-
ter spot; the rich people of Long Island are 
legitimate 
energy 
consumers. 
And 
Quinnipiac Energy, the obvious target, is 
just following the rules.
