A student service organization goes national,
but continues to struggle at home

NE DAY LAST FALL, Charlie Johnson, a middle aged New
Havener who had relied on the government for subsis-
tence came to a realization: he simply couldn' t make it
on welfare. He couldn't communicate with his casew<?rker and
found the government bureaucracy so impersonal and slow-mov-
ing that it seemed more a hindrance than a benefit. "They' re
always condemning you and saying you're not doing nothing to
try to help yourself," he told me. "They're not really hearing
you." Like hundreds of people in New Haven cut off from federal
subsidies as a result of recent welfare reform, Johnson longed to
pull himself our of destitution, but was unsure how.

After holding a string of fleeting, low-paying jobs, he found
his way to the steps of 178 Temple Street on the advice of a flyer
he noticed at a homeless shelter. Here, he thought, was a chance
he might receive the help he needed. Inside the Temple Street
office, he spied a few armchairs, a shelf full of books and papers, a
fax machine, and a large sign on the wall: "Welcome to National
Studenr Partnerships."

National Student Partnerships (NSP) is a Yale undergraduate
organization with an uncommonly ambitious goal: to compensate
for a governmenr welfare system that it perceives to be an utter
failure. The group' s mission statemenr is "to ensure that all
Americans have access to the services, opportunities and attention
that they need in their pursuit of employment, self-sufficiency,
and personal success." In theory, NSP acts as a medium, connect-
ing clients with employers, housing authoriry, and healthcare
providers that would normally be out of reach. In acrualiry,
though, this process is far more complicated. NSP tries to improve
people' s lives, but ultimately reveals the frustrations and paradox-
es of trying to fix sociery &om the ground up.

National Student Partnerships was the brainchild of rwo
intrepid Yale students, Kirsten Lodal and Brian Kreiter. Midway
through their college careers, the rwo began to see their fellow stu-
dents in a new light, as the potential work force of an efficient ser-
vice organization. In November of 1998, they launched "NSP Kick
22.
Off" festivities, attracting 700 students and supporters, and rais-
ing almost $4,000 to offset start-up costs. NSP soon leased its first
office in New Haven, which was staffed by student volunteers. In
Lodal's eyes, altruistic Yalies seemed the perfect antidote to the ills
of government bureaucracy.

Today, proceedings remain informal in the one-room office,
whose carefully planned decor-from freshly painted blue walls to
complimentary coffee--fosters an atmosphere of laid-back profes-
sionalism. The students who work at the office are given a great
deal of autonomy and discretion when it comes to helping their
clients; each is expected to learn the client' s background and to
think creatively about how best to get him or her the necessary
services. The work is meant to be as unstructured as possible--a
perfect match for idealistic college students.

Success, NSP leaders say, is hard to define. Though the orga-
nization' s standards are high, student volunteers are obviously
limited in their capacities to achieve substantive gains for clients.
NSP counters this by valuing even the most minor accomplish-
ments, such as driving a person to a government office or consol-
ing them emotionally, because that is often the kind of work col-
lege students are most qualified to do. As Business Outreach
Coordinator Justin Loring put it, " The abiliry of a fresh perspec-
tive to find the answers to the problem or to motivate [a client] to
keep going is success in itself."

Coming from an organization that has attained national
prominence, this contentment with small victories is puzzling.
From September of 2.002. until February of this year-the months
ha.rdest on the poor and homeless-NSP's success rate was dubi-
ous: of the 2.8 people who sent in requests for education and job
training, only 13 people' s needs were met; of the 74 who applied
for housing, only 6 were rewarded; and of the 150 who sought
work, a paltry 14 had luck.

National Student Partnerships has a simple solution for its
shortcomings, however: expansion. After college, Lodal and
Kreiter worked vigorously to transform NSP into a national orga-
