"Every game you play, every night you 
stay, I'll be watching you." Twenty-
four hours a day the police-the 
Connecticut State Police, that is-sends 
out a similar message to terrorists. Since 
July 2001, the department's Bell 407 has 
patrolled the skies watching for terrorists 
while keeping an eye on civilian activity. 
The helicopter is a monument of American 
strength, power, and extravagance. For the 
bargain price of $2.3 billion, Connecticut 
taxpayers have stocked up on terrorist-
stomping technology in a single helicopter: 
Trooper One. But fear not New Haven, 
this one chopper show is equipped with 
some of the freshest gadgets in aviation 
technology. 

Steve Sampson, a Trooper One pilot-
in-training, knows all the jewels hidden in 
this terror-fighting machine. Its wire strikers come in handy during drug busts. They 
are crucial for slashing those low-hanging 
copter-flipping wires strung over marijuana 
fields. The helicopter's two cameras offer a 
cure for the "It Wasn't Me" syndrome common to hit-and-run drivers. The craft's 
Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) scanner 
once spotted a man standing half-sub-
merged in a freezing river, only a few hundred 
feet from where he had hidden a 
stolen (and subsequently totaled) car. 
Sampson explained that with the help of a 
Global Positioning System, state police 
once tracked down the abode of an "intoxicated gentleman" who, in a modified game 
of whack-a-mole, would "pop out of his 
house and shoot off a couple of rounds," 
then disappear back inside. The helicopter, 
using its infrared scanner identified the 
man's final popping place, enabling ground 
police to promptly restrain him. 

Armed with the necessary equipment, 
Trooper One is an eager watchdog with a 
sharp bite-but not always a good eye. 
Shortly after September 11, 2001, the blue 
and yellow helicopter investigated a suspicious case, in which two men in a law office 
parking garage were spotted carrying 
"sniper rifles." With the help of a FLIR 
scanner and a Microwave Data Downlink 
system, Trooper One used the men's body 
heat to pinpoint their location. Troopers 
stormed the garage, startling two cameramen with tripods in their hands. 

Another red herring led Sampson to a 
"very suspicious" un-lit boat floating 
underneath Gold Star Bridge at midnight. 
Sampson alerted the Coast Guard, who 
discovered that the boat's occupants were 
just a couple of guys out fishing. The helicopter has helped bring down suspicious 
aircraft, intercepting six so far. Sampson 
explains that, similar to a highway patrol 
car, the helicopter signals for the offending 
craft to land, then follows them down to 
earth. Unfortunately, in every instance so 
far, the pilots have been unaware that they 
were flying in restricted areas. And one has 
to wonder: Do terrorists respond to hand 
signals? 

With the inception of the war in Iraq 
and the heightened terror alert, the helicopter has turned its attention to hunting 
terrorists, and has given a back seat to the 
unrelated "flood of calls" received by the 
Aviation Unit. Everyday, Trooper One performs a routine infrastructure check. It 
zooms over power plants, the U.S. Navy 
submarine and military base, Pfizer's 
research facility in Groton, airports, major 
cities, and bridges, primarily the Gold Star 
Bridge in New London and the Pearl 
Harbor Memorial Bridge in New Haven. 

As a part of "Operation Liberty Shield," 
five National Guard Black Hawk helicopters have joined up with Trooper One 
to patrol Connecticut skies twenty-four 
hours a day. 

Despite the helicopter's recent success 
in tracking down a drug dealer on the run 
and locating two lost nine-year-old girls via 
the signals from their toy store walkie 
talkies, the community has expressed some 
doubt as to whether the helicopter is an 
efficient use of state money. With extensive 
budget cuts, $1,000 per flight hour seems 
excessive, given the lack of terrorist threats 
averted thus far. 

However, many states look 
to Connecticut's aviation program as a prototype. Nevada has already purchased a helicopter similar to Trooper One, and the 
New York Police Department has also 
shown interest. Sampson welcomes to the 
station citizens who want to learn more 
about the mysterious helicopter they see 
flying around. He feels it is important to 
inform people about exactly what their 
money is buying. When someone gawks at 
its extremely high price, Sampson has a 
ready reply: "You can't put a price on life." 

Though the unlucky cameraman who 
was mistaken as a sniper might not agree, 
the pilot has a good point. For the rest of 
us, when the terrorist warning reaches 
super-bright hunter orange, we will be able 
to look into the sky and feel comforted to 
know that Trooper One is watching over us 
as we mow our lawns.
