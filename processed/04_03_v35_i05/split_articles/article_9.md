Comic Relief 
REcENTLY, I FOUND MYSELF SITTING in the 
multi-purpose room of the Madison 
Library, clenching a straw between my 
teeth. JoAnne Kacillas, founder of "Surfing 
the Stress Laughter Clubs," was leading 
one of her hour-long laughing sessions. My 
classmates were a group of old ladies who 
called themselves "The Empey Nesters," or 
"Nesters" for short. "Careful now, don't let 
your lips touch the straw," our reacher 
instructed us. 

Kacillas, a former corporate lawyer, 
runs just the local leg of a global laughter 
movement. In 1995, Dr. Madan Kataria 
founded the first laughter club in Mumbai, 
India to promote the physical and psycho-
logical health of Indians, whom he believed 
were suffering from laughter deficiency. 
His classes, which allegedly reduce stress 
levels, benefit the immune system, and 
provide cardiovascular exercise, caught on 
quickly. Currently, there are over 800 
Laughter Clubs worldwide, with new chap-
ters opening in Budapest, Vietnam, and 
Iran in the near future. The laughter capi-
tal of America is Columbus, Ohio, where 
"Joyologist" Steve Wilson leads the "World 
Laughter Tour." Kacillas, who has a B.A. 
from Brown and a J.D. from Cornell, 
became a C.L.L. (Certified Laughter 
Leader) in 2002. Since th en, she has 
brought her "Surfing the Stress Laughter 
Clubs" to companies, hospitals, and 
schools throughour Connecticut. 

Though Wllson and Kataria are hard-
ly household names, the laughter move-
ment is receiving more and more publicity. 
Over the 
past year, 
a 
handful of 
Connecticut newspapers, radio stations 
and even television programs have featured 
Kacillas. She has not, as of yet, led a laugh-
ter class at Yale, but perhaps she should. 
Like other Yalies, I like to embrace my mis-
ery from time to time. I am a player, nay, 
master, of the "I-have-more-work-than-
you-and-haven't-slept-in-three-no-four-
days" contest. Bur Kacillas, who signs her 
emails "Together in Mirth, JoAnne," had 
encouraged me ro visit a class. As any 
C.L.L. will tell you, you don't have to be a 
natural giggler to benefit from a laughter 
club. Laughter Leaders don'r recommend 
telling jokes, arguing that few people find 
the same things funny. Instead of gags, they 
recommend a sequence of laughing exercis-
es that can give the benefits of laughter ro 
anyone, even those of us with no sense of 
humor. 

On my first Laughter C lub visit, I 
found myself the only non-Nester in the 
room, the youngesr student by about fifty 
APRIL 2003 
years. The women were very welcoming, 
and directed me to rhe rea rable w here 
muffins and cookies had been carefully 
arranged around an Easter centerpiece. 
"Oh what a beautiful papier-mache rab-
bit," one lady raved to her friend, "Audrey, 
you're so ralenred." Afrer sampling a cook-
ie, I took my seat in the communal circle 
with the mistress of papier-mache biting 
her straw to my left. Forcing your face inro 
the expression of a smile, we were 
informed, produces beta endorphins and 
gives your body the same benefits as a gen-
uine grin. I let my endorphins go to work 
and surveyed the rest of the group. The 
Nester opposite me was a tiny woman wirh 
bright red hair, whose stick-like body and 
large head gave the general impression of a 
lollipop. Another woman held her straw 
with an easy smile. She was, I noted, rhe 
only one wearing a skirt, though she had 
surprisingly nice legs rhat she wasn't afraid 
to show off. My cheeks were getting tired. 
T he smallest woman in rhe group, whose 
black orthopedics dangled several inches 
above rhe grey carpet, seemed to be feeling 
my pain. Clenching her straw dutifully, she 
raised her eyebrows in a desperate plea to 
our leader. 

Finally, JoAnne instructed us to 
remove our srraws and proceeded to lead us 
through a sequence of exercises. "Laughing 
is like jogging for your insides," she 
informed us. First, we walked around the 
room, shook each other's hands, and 
laughed "just because." Then came the 
"bow and arrow exercise." As we pulled 
back our imaginary strings, we began with 
light, "ha ha ha's." Then, when we released 
the arrow (taking care, as our reacher had 
instructed us, not ro hir anyone), we raised 
our hands above our heads and emitted a 
peal of "hee bee bee's." "One minute of 
deep laughter is equal to ten minutes on a 
rowing machine," JoAnne reminded us. 

We went on ro play the "Old 
Stony Face" game, in which one person 
tries to keep a straight face while her part-
ner tries to make her laugh. Across the 
room, Legs raised her arms in a "praise be 
hallelujah" sort of way, shaking her hands 
and asking the rhetorical quesrion "am-I-
funny-or-am-1-fwmy?" with bobbing eye-
brows. 

Next came the "lion laugh." With 
their eyes wide, fingers splayed, and 
tongues hanging loose, I could barely rec-
ognize les belles dames Lollipop and Papier-
Mache. Luckily, we quickly moved on to 
rhe "remote control exercise," which 
involved walking through the group and 
clicking at each other. As Lollipop clicked 
at me, I found myself searching for new 
ways to laugh, the "ho ho's," "hee bee's" 
and "ha ha's" seemed to be getting redun-
dant. I am proud to say that in the course 
of the exercise I upgraded from three fuzzy 
channels to basic cable. I am particularly 
fond of my husky "huwaaah ha ha ha'' and 
ascending "hoaaeee hee hee hee." 

As the class started to wind down, 
JoAnne spoke about the broader goals of 
laughter clubs. "The World Laughter Tour 
has as its mission inner peace and world 
peace." "Think globally, laugh locally," she 
advised, and gave us The Spirit of Laughter; 
Sensible Living Guidelines. 

On my way out, I asked some of my 
classmates wherher they liked the club. "It 
was fun to do once," one Nester replied, 
"but I wouldn't want to do it every week." 
As for me, I've got a straw in m y 
reerh right now.

Brain Drain 
SrrnNG IN HIS NEUROSCIENCE LAB ar Yale, 
with its laser scanning microscopes, the 
small village where Nenad Sescan grew up 
seems very far away. His story began in 
Croatia where his intelligence helped him 
ger inro a top-notch high school in a neigh-
boring rown. Despite his good grades, he. 
recalls char the reachers there made fun of 
his rural dialecr. 

While in high school, Sestan .:,.;as 
inspired by neuroscience, and decided to 
devote his life to research, enrolling in 
medical school in Zagreb, Croatia's capital. 
He even knew which lab he wanted to 
work in. When the professor there rejected 
him, Sestan would not give up. He got 
himself hired as a "slave," as he puts it, to a 
postdoctoral student in the lab, washing 
piles of Erlenmeyer flasks in order to watch 
real science happen. 

Ironically, luck came to Sestan in the 
form of the Yugoslavian civil war. The prin-
cipal investigator of the lab became 
immersed in politics, the Serbian student 
who hired him fled, and Sestan himself 
escaped t~e draft, leaving him alone in the 
lab, to work with only occasional guidance. 
When the war effort took away the lab's 
funding, Sestan looked frantically for other 
sources of money. He wrote to the Croatian 
community in the United States, asking its 
members to contribute to the war effort by 
supporting science. He got what he want-
ed. Equipped with new tools and chemi-
cals, he spent all his waking hours in the 
lab. His diligence paid off. At the age of 
twenty-one, Sestan published his first 
paper. 

With his new success, Sestan felt he 
had to go West. In Croatia, tenured acade-
mics srayed in their sears for decades, 
squeezing out young people, and there sim-
ply wasn't room for new scientists. The lack 
of resources also hindered research and stu-
dents 
scrounged 
to 
find 
organs. 
Pathologists were the only ones authorized 
to remove organs for examination. In order 
to have access to the human tissue needed 
to study neuroanatomy, "everyone wanted 
to have a pathologist as a friend," Sesran 
chuckles. 

Today Sestan feels that he has achieved 
his dream at Yale: he has the resources and 
dynamic colleagues he always wanted. 
Here, he says, "there is a constant flux of 
fresh young minds." 

Sestan has devoted most of his life to 
the study of science, and continues to do 
so. His foil, so to speak, has always.been the 
medical professional-in Croatia, and in 
America. Back home, the village doctor 
enjoyed high social status. It was customary 
to honor--or, rather, to bribe-the doctor 
for better care. Villagers consulted him for 
advice on a range of topics, from wine-
tasting to politics. Though academia was
