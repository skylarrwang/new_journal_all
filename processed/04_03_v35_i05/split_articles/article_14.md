A
S WORKERS AT YALE READIED FOR BATTLE against the University 
late last February, a senior member of their team was conspic-
uously absent. John Wilhelm, the grizzled leader of the Hotel 
and Restaurant Employees International Union (HEREIU) and a 
top negotiator for the Yale unions currently seeking a new contract, 
had slipped away to a resort hotel in southern Florida. He was there 
to address an urgent problem: the decay of America's national labor 
movement. As a result of the recent economic downturn, a strong-
ly anti-union federal government, and an expanding global market, 
union membership across the country was in a downward spiral. 

For more than a year, Wilhelm's own union's membership had 
diminished by as much as 40 percent, and the numbers for many 
other unions were worse. All of the big players in the American 
Federation of Labor and Congress oflndustrial Organi~tion (AFL-
CIO), the largest union al.liance in the country, had convened in 
Florida for the group's annual conference, where they scrambled for 
a solution to save the dying labor movement. 

After the conference, Wilhelm returned to New Haven, where 
he joined a raucous army of over 4,000 striking custodians, clerical 
workers, hospital workers, and graduate srudencs. They marched up 
Elm Street behind a stern-faced Jesse Jackson, who bellowed phras-
es of condemnation into the cold night air. For the next week, pick-
eters protested oucside important Yale buildings in the mornings 
and attended motivational speeches and rallies in the afternoons. 

AFL-CIO President John Sweeney made an appearance, as did 
Princeton professor Cornel West. It was a carefully orchestrated 
show, a calculated demonstration of hard-won union strength. 

Then the news hit: At the conference in Florida, far from the 
limelight of the Yale strike, John Wilhelm and several other labor 
leaders were reported to have staged "something of a palace coup" 
at the AFL-CIO, according to Businm ~ek magazine. They had 
forged a "new governing body to run the federation" -a committee 
of 15 labor leaders who would meet every month in Washington, 
D.C. and advise President Sweeney. Business wt-ek strongly implied 
that Wilhelm was the brains behind the takeover. "Today's labor 
movement was invented in the 1950s and hasn't changed much 
since," Wilhelm declared. "We noed dramatic change." Wilhelm, it 
seemed, had much more on his mind than mere contracts for Yale's 
workers and recognition for ics graduate students as he marched 
alongside his comrades. The swirl of union activity at Yale was turn-
ing out to be something far more complicated than it seemed-and 
John Wilhelm was beginning to look like the possible key to an 
unfurling trade union revolution. 

W 
ILHELM DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A MAN EAGER TO SEIZE the reins 
of the national labor movement. His face and body are 
worn by years of service to his cause. At 58, he walks with a 
cane to support his newly-replaced hip. His gait is that of an elder 
statesman, one who has put in his time and now wanes simply to 
relax and enjoy his memories . 

But there is a fighter beneath Wilhelm's weary facade. He is the 
quiet mastermind behind the last 35 years of Yale union activity, the 
organizer of thousands of workers, the overseer of nine contract 
negotiations, and the figurehead of seven acrimonious strikes. For 
as long as Yale's custodial and clerical workers have stood together 
against Yale, Wilhelm has been there. The story of the present labor 
strife is, in essence, the story of John Wilhelm's life. 

Ironically, Wilhelm found his calling at the very University that 
he later made a career of tormenting. A member of the class of 1967, 
he graduated Magna Cum Laude from and was a member of the 
Phi Beta Kappa. For the most pan, he spent his time at Yale 
immersed in 6os radicalism. Trips to civil righcs and anti-war 
protests were supplemented by investigative journeys into the slums 
of New Haven and academic work focused on left-wing heroes. 

Wilhelm attributes his radical politics to his single mother, an 
uncommonly progressive woman from Virginia coal coumry who 
raised him on the twin doctrines of liberalism and traditional 
unionism. When the question of de-segregating the schools in 
Wilhelm's home county of Arlington made its way into federal 
coun in 1958, he remembers that she surprised him and his siblings 
by telling them to take the day off from school and go down to the 
courthouse. "She said, 'You'll learn a lot more in that courthouse 
than you will in any schoolroom today,"' he recalls. 

But nothing jolted Wilhelm's political consciousness like expe-
riencing fir~t-hand one of the poorest cities in the country. Near the 
end of college, he joined a group called the American Independent 
Movement that was working to reinvigorate the dilapidated Hill 
neighborhood. His daily encounters with decaying neighborhoods 
and prosperous slumlords convinced him of a simple idea: poverty 
needs to be eradicated. "It seemed to me that virtually all the prob-
lems that people in the H ill neighborhood were wrestling with 
were, at bottom, because they were poor," he remembers. " You 
could fight about schools, housing, lots of things-but if people 
remained poor, it seemed to me they were going to remain power-
less." Frusuated, he remained in New Haven after graduation, 
working to help the destitute and preaching the gospel of econom-
ic empowerment. 

Then, one day in 1969, he came across a small want ad in the 
Nnu Hawn Rqjstn: "Labor leader trainee wanted. Long hours, low 
pay. Must be single." With the exception of the last stipulation, 
W Uhelm thought himself a good fit, and responded to the ad and 
arranged an interview. He landed the job and suddenly found him-
self at the head of a small New Haven service union, Local217, with 
little idea of what he was getting into. 

As it turned out, the man who hired him, Vincent Sirabella, 
was kicking off a massive campaign to revamp union activity at 
Yale. He had recently become the first leader ofYale's only union, 
the custodial and dining hall workers' Local 35· When Sirabella 
came on board, Local 35 was in bad shape. A year earlier, Yale had 
defeated the leaderless and ineffective union in its first strike in two 
decades, and had recently hired two notoriously anti-union execu-
tives. The contracts of the sos and 6os were based on a ~ry infor-
mal, quid pro quo understanding between labor and management-
low but secure wages, in exchange for peace and stability. But now 
the University seemed to have strayed from its former path, and the 
unions were terrified. 

In the ensuing struggle, which produced three strikes in the 
span of a single decade, WUhelm found not only a home. but a 
father. For ten years, he tagged alongside Sirabella as an apprentice. 
For Wilhelm, Sirabella embodied the possibility of an enlightened 
unionism--one that could reconcile liberal ideas of respcc::t and 
inclusion with old-fashioned union muscle. •Vinny was an cctraor-
dinary man," Wilhelm remembers. "He had an unusual theory: In 
order for the labor movement to revitalize and re-energize icsdf, it 
had to tap into the kind of energy typified by the civil rights moYe-
ment and the anti-war m~ment." 

To many union leaders, Sirabella and Wdhdm musr have 
seemed eccentric and idealistic. At mat time, the trade union .IDOV'e-
ment was openly xenophobic and often very conservuiw. But 
something in Sirabella's vision captivated Walhdm. He tboupt that 
he could use it to bring about serious change at Yale and pollihly 
elsewhere. When Sirabdla left his ~t at Local3s in 1978, WDbelm 
gladly stepped up to replace him.

T 
HE YALE OF THE EAIU.Y 8os WAS THE TESTING G.OVMD for 
Wilhelm's idealism. It was clear that the University wu going 
to make life tough for the unions in at least the fOreseeable 
furure, and Local 35 was determined to preempt agression. Finally,

a plan crystallized: Moum a campaign ro 
organize rhe University's mostly white, 
female, and middle-class clerical and tech-
nical workers. The logic was simple; if 
Local 35 could bring in these workers, they 
could create an alliance with a monopoly 
on the University's most essential workers. 

So in 1980, Wilhelm enlisted the help 
and resources of Local 35's parent union, 
the Hotel and Restaurant Employees 
International Union (HEREIU), to initiate 
a massive organizing campaign. Outside 
unions had tried to organize Yale's white-
collar set a number of times to no avail. But 
the HEREIU organizers were confident 
chat this time would be different. They 
had inside connections: Many of the Local 
35 members had spouses and relatives who 
worked clerical and technical jobs at the 
University. The organizers quickly found 
hundreds of people interested in unioniz-
ing and filed for a National Labor Relations 
Board (NLRB) election, the standard 
process for organizing a new union. In the 
meantime, workers and students went 
down to the NLRB hearings to agitate. In 
May of 1983, the hard work paid off: Yale's 
clerical and technical workers narrowly 
won the election, and Local 34 was born. 

Bur the fight to establish Local 34 had 
just begun. The union's attempt to negoti-
ate its fuse contract with the University 
stalled at the end of 1984. The cause of this 
breakdown was unclear, but union mem-
bers suspected that the University was try-
ing to break the fledgling local's back 
before it got off the ground. As Wilhelm 
put it, "The University basically dared 
them to go on strike." Indeed, a strike 
could mean good things for a University 
itching to get rwo unions off its back. The 
loose alliance formed ben.veen Locals 34 
and 35 dyring the organizing drive matched 
up rwo very different workforces-a set of 
mostly white women and a group of most-
ly working-class men, many of whom were 
minorities. For this reason, it stood to 
crumble far more easily than the average 
u11ion coalition. 

After Local 34 officially went on strike 
in September of 1984, Yale told the mem-
bers of Local 35 that they would be fired if 
they supported che strikers. Even Wilhelm 
wasn't sure rhat the custodial and dining 
hall workers, whose contract didn't expire 
until the beginning of the next year, would 
stand up for their co-workers. But they did. 
An estimated 90 percent ofLocal35 walked 
out the next day and lent their support to 
what turned out to be a ten and a half week 
strike. When I asked Wilhelm to explain 
how that seemingly miraculous turn tran-
spired, his response was cryptic. He 
referred ro his old reacher: "Vinny always 
used ro say, 'If you told the workers the 
truth, if you gave them the facts they need-
ed, they would figure out the right thing ro 
do."' 

Ir takes more than the truth to orga-
nize workers, however. The campaign that 
Wilhelm engineered was a product of care-
ful srraregizing and skillful politicking. He 
played a forceful role behind the scenes, 
cozying up to the union membership while 
still playing hardball with the University. 
Several weeks into the strik~ Wilhelm 
urged workers to return to their jobs while 
students were away for the holiday. The 
idea was not only that strikers would get a 
break from the picket lines, but that the 
unions would be in a position to strike 
again when students returned. The tactic, 
dubbed "Home for the Holidays," turned 
our ro be decisive. In January of 1985,
