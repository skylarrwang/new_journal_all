Revolution for Sale
Yale Stude~ts pay a visit to Castro's Cuba
T HAS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE THE IMAGE of a Stern-faced Fidel
Castro with his trademark beard and military fatigues has
reminded any American of immi.nent military threat. But any-
one who thinks the Cuban Revolution is a closed chapter in 20th-
century history books would find plenty to surprise them in con-
temporary Cuba, beginning with the billboards that greet visitors at
Jose Marti International Airport in Havana. The slogans-"44 years
of glory!" "With intelligence and perseverance, we will triumph!"
"In every neighborhood, Revolution!"-make a strong case chat the
Revolution is alive and kicking in Cuba. And anyone who wants to
understand what that means for the island's twelve million inhabi-
tants has taken on a challenge that is mammoth, if not downright
impossible.

The group of 16 Yalies with whom I traveled to Cuba this past
spring break knew that we would have to face this challenge. For
two months we had raised questions and qualms about the Cuban
revolution-focusing on environmental studies, medicine, architec-
ture, music, political science-in a student-designed anthropology
seminar. Now, in a plane over the Atlantic, my curiosity was tucked
neatly between the medical supplies and SPF-45 sunscreen in my
suitcase. We were finally on our way co the island for a firsthand
view of our class's nebulous subject matter

But in order to get this far, we had to sign on as political
tourists, to be shuttled between appointments with government
agencies, health clinics, and cultural houses. A governmem agency
with the suggestive title, "Cuban Institute for Friendship Among
Peoples" had created an itinerary for us according to our hazily
articulated interests, and a guide with a bus and driver awaited us
on the other side of customs. We were not the only group of
American college students spending their March vacation in Cuba:
groups from Cornell, Princeton, and the University of Illinois were
in Havana that week as well. Increased demand from the United
States has meant flights filled weekly with students, conference
attendees, and Cuban-Americans returning to visit family and
friends.

We stayed in the Vedado section of Havana, a luxurious neigh-
borhood stretching north to the Malec6n, Havana's seaside high-
way, and west towards the myriad alleyways and colonial architec-
ture of .Central and Old Havana. Vedado's quiet streets are lined
with the decaying mansions of Cuba's pre-Revolutionary glitterati.
The window panes on the houses are mostly broken now, and their
columns and balconies are crumbling, peeling, slowly relinquishing
their old-world gallantry to the thick island heat. Children play in
empty side streets off the main arteries of Lfnea and Paseo; old cars
and motorbikes with sidecars pass in isolated precessions. As far as
we could tell, traffic is almost unknown in today's gas-strapped
Cuba.

Even before the Revolution, Cuba held an almost mythic
appeal to American travelers. The opportunity to go there legally,
under the auspices of a Yale-sponsored Cuban studies program, had
brought to the surface my latent desire to explore untraditional
places, particularly one as rich in contradictions as Cuba. I knew the
limitations of what I could learn in a mere ten days: Still, I had lit-
de sense of the profound ambiguity presented by a government
both visionary and opportunistic-one that decries imperialism on
the one hand and bends over backwards to accommodate foreign
tourists on the other. Cuba today, we quickly learned, is a hall of
mirrors, a place from which visiting students are likely to leave with
little more than improved rhythm and a few boxes of Cuban cigars.

H
AVANA IS NOT AN EASY CITY TO GET TO KNOW. At times, it
seemed the city's inhabitants were finishing 01lt the ninth
inning of a long-decided baseball game, playing more out
of habit than conviction. The neglected buildings collapse at a rate
of more than one a day. Chalkboards listing ration allotments at
neighborhood distribution centers always have empty spaces next to
chicken, fish, and cigars. In the evenings, the exoticism of crowds
standing idly along the Malec6n conceals the boredom on the faces
of SO many young people. Without dollars, they cannot afford tO
hang out anywhere else.
