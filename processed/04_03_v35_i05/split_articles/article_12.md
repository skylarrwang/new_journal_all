NGLISH STATION WAS BUILT lN THE LATE 1940S on a small spit 
of land, just off the banks of the Mill River. The plant was 
designed co provide electricity from hydraulic energy and to 
burn oil. Bordered by Grand and Wolcott Streets, English Station 
lies near the heart of Fair Haven and has been a thorn in the sides 
of its owners for decades. In the 1980s, federal standards became 
more stringent for factory emissions. This meant char United 
Illuminating (Ul), the owner of the plant at the rime, was running 
a dinosaur that would have co be shut down or cleaned up. The 
obsolete boilers were designed to burn oil so crude it was essential-
ly tar, at some temperatures thick enough to walk on. Clean-up 
would have cost several hundreds of millions of dollars. In addition 
to this, a new regulation, aimed at curbing monopolies on power, 
required companies to choose between being generators or distrib-
utors of energy. UI, owning several ocher power plants and also 
some power lines in New Haven, chose co cur its losses and aban-
don its plants. 

United Illuminating managed to sell all of its plants e~cept for 
English Station, which stood deserted until 1998. Because the envi-
ronmental liabilities and the cleanup necessary co restart the power 
plant were so significant, English Station rotted on the market for 
years before a tiny privately owned offshoot of UI, Quinnipiac 
Energy (QE) acquired it. UI handed QE a lump sum of $4Â·5 mil-
lion to take the plant off its hands. Scott DeGeeter, project manag-
er for QE, makes no bones about the transaction: "It is public 
knowledge that we were paid to rake it. UI could have spent $15 mil-
lion to tear the place to the ground or they could have paid us $4.5 
million to rake the property and all the environmental liabilities and 
ongoing responsibilities of the property for one third the cost." 

DeGeeter readily admits that the plant was unwanted: "As 
soon as you walk into an old station with environmental liabilities 
that are unknown, you need to be able to make a lor of money right 
away off of that piece of property to make ir attractive enough to 
take those liabilities. You could be buying tens of millions of dollars 
of clean-up costs." But Quinnipiac Energy was far from an unsus-
pecting buyer. Because QE was originally part of Ul, it was famil-
iar with the plant and irs risks. 

Despite the unusual terms of the transaction, rhe owners ofQE 
saw English Station as a profitable venture. Mark Minninberg, for-
mer front man for Qunnipiac Energy, tried ro sell the community 
on the purchase. He staged slideshows for Fair Haven and New 
Haven residents, oucling propositions that seemed too good to be 
true. And they were. Originally, QE claimed ir wanted to burn oil 
only until it could afford co convert to natural gas, which, incred-
ibly, was projected to have a net clean air benefic. Yer when the com-
pany presented its final proposal, there was no mention of natural 
gas. 

The proposal was immediately met with protesr in Fair Haven 
and across the state: Connecticur Fund for rhe Environment, New 
Haven Enviornmental Justice Coalition, and New Haven's Mayor 
John DeStefano formally opposed the permit to the Department of 
Environmental Protection (DEP) during several public hearings. 
Quinnipiac Energy won the first two rounds: The permit was rec-
ommended by the staff of the DEP and later by an appeal officer, 
Janice Deshais. On March 19, the opposition made a final attempt 
co get the permit denied in a hearing in front of the Commissioner 
of the DEP, Arc Roque. 


**Title: A New School for Fair Haven**

A
S THIS LITTLE BATTLE ESCAJ-ATEO, in another part of tOwn, 
Fair Haveners were celebrating a victory. The School 
Construction Project, an organization affiliated with the 
New Haven School Board, had been granted funding co build a 
new school in the community. The school would serve children in 
kindergarten through eighth grade-the first of its kind in the city. 
''All our other buildings are renovations and additions, and we have 
a couple of new buildings to replace some older buildings, but this 
one is a complete start from scratch," said Susan Weisselberg, coor-
dinator of the School Construction Project. 

The new school is greatly needed. Like many low-income com-
munities, Fair Haven is plagued by overcrowded schools and is 
forced to bus hundreds of students to other districts every day. In 
fact, it has been 30 years since Fair Haven built a new school. At 
s36.7 million, it is one of the most expensive education projects in 
Connecticut, and a high profile success story for the community. 

Unfortunately, the school will sit just a few hundred yards from 
the plant. Weisselberg said the Board of Education looked at many 
different locations and finally decided on this one for several rea-
sons: "This was a part of Fair Haven that was underserved by 
schools. Another aspect is that New Haven is quire developed and 
it is very difficult co find land for almost anything but particularly 
for new schools. We looked at almost anything ... residential prop-
erties, industrial properties, vacant lots." They could nor build on 
wetlands or park land, and they wanted the school to be on James 
Street, so the choices were limited. In a city nearly filled co capaci-
ty, there was simply no other space. 

In other words, there was no lapse of judgment on the part 
of the School Construction Project. The Project was keenly aware 
of the nearness of the power plant; they just had roo little to work 
with. Weisselberg insists that the proximity of English Station was 
taken into account when designing the school. Models showed that 
the effects of the plant would be minimal. But Jay Brotman, the 
architect, was skeptical. So when designing the air conditio~ing sys-
tem for the school, Brotman made sure to leave room for extra fil-
ters and scrubbers to purify the incoming air. In addition, the gym 
and the pool were placed on the plot ofland nearest the plant, while 
the main facility would be adjacent to it. But English Station was 
not the only industrial concern. Brotman was more worried about 
the Talmage Brothers oyster shell operation. "There is an at odor 
certain times of the year" -another reason why an internal air sys-
tem is a necessity. 

English Station seems to loom like a black cloud over the new 
school. But the power plant was initially not a concern of Fair 
Haveners. "To be honest with you, the concerns we have heard are: 
When will it be done, we can't wait to send our kids there," says 
Weisselberg. "We had a 
lot of support from the 
community 
to 
build 
something there, to put a 
school there. They were 
very excited about it 
because Fair Haven K-8 
will have a swimming 
pool and a full sized gym." 
Weisselberg also noted 
that if English Station 
refires, the particulates 
released will go beyond 
the school's boundaries. 
Because most of the chil-
dren who will be attending the school live in the area, they will 
already be dealing with pollution on every corner. 


**Title:  Quinnipiac Energy's Plan**
**Page number(s): 11**

I
N A CITY WHERE AIR QUALITY already fails co meet standards, one 
more plant may be one too many. But QE has found a way 
around such objections. 

Quinnipiac Energy's plan for operation is clever, perhaps even 
insidious, but ultimately legal. The only way QE could be granted 
a permit ro burn oil is if English Station operates as a "minor 
source" of pollution. To fall under this classification, the plant will 
have to adhere to strict emissions regulations. Emissions are regu-
lated in cerms of tons of particulates released per year. Even low-sul-
fur diesel oil (relatively clean fuel) would be tightly monitored-
only 25 tons of nitrous oxide and 6. 5 tons of sulfur dioxides per year. 

But the loophole is that these tons of particulates can be released 
any time, whether that be over one day or three hundred. To max-
imize profit, English Station will run as a "peaking plant," meaning 
ir will burn only 23 calendar days each year, for three to five hun-
dred hours, but it will produce as many tons of particulates in this 
condensed period as a "minor source" is allowed to produce all year. 

QE will sell the energy on high demand days, including the honest 
days of summer and coldest of winter, when air conditioning and 
hearing-use are at their peaks, allowing them co rurn a profit despite 
the immense carrying costs. 

These short bursts of energy are usually sold on an electricity 
spot market, similar ro a stock market. On high demand days, 
transmission companies that exceed their allotment of contracted 
electricity must purchase extra power. Sellers with the lowest bids 
get picked; but sellers don't know what their competitors are offer-
ing, making the business quite a gamble. Shrewdly, QE has con-
tracted with UI and Connecticut Light and Electricity. This takes 
the risk out of the peak demand market for QE and also sets the 
prices for the transmitters, blurring the generator-distributor dis-
tinction and circumventing anti-monopoly regulation. 

Ultimately the plant will provide only seven new jobs for Fair 
Haven and without question 
will add pollutants to the air. 
On the other hand, it will gen-
erate over half a million dollars 
in tax revenue for the city of 
New 
Haven. 
Quinnipiac 
Energy has even opted to use 
relatively clean fuel. According 
to DeGeeter, QE's fuel con-
tains one-sixth the sulfur of the 
fuel used to heat homes. He 
equated the additional English 
Station emissions to adding 
four new transit buses to the 
city. 

Bur whether English Station will be equivalent to four or four 
million new transit buses seems beside the point: Quinnipiac 
Energy is acting within the scope of the law. As DeGeeter emphat-
ically stressed, "You cannot under law impose on me anything more 
stringent than if I meet the current regulations ... We exceed the 
current regulations, therefore there is really legally no way that they 
can deny you a permit. That's the basis of all the law in this coun-
try, right? You set a standard; you meet a standard; you can conduct 
your business." In March, the DEP agreed. 


**Title: The DEP and the Interveners**
**Page number(s): 11-12**

T
HE DEP RECOMMENDED QuiNNIPIAC ENERGY be granted 
the permit because QE met the regulations. But for the 
interveners, there is still hope. There are a few sentences in 
the Connecticut Protection Act that give an agency the right to 
impose stricter standards than the law requires. Elizabeth Gilson, a 
lawyer representing the Mayor, summed up the argument: "In this 
case, there is one teeny-weenie footnote that we hang our hat on. In 
cases where it's an agency hearing, the agency has the expertise to 
look at where there's unreasonable pollution, regardless of the exis-
tence of the regs. And because this is a minor source that's blowing 
irs wad in 23 days, I'm going to argue that the regs don't apply so 
the Commissioner doesn't even have ro look at them." In other 
words, because there will be intense emissions over a short period of 
time, the agency has the right to step in. But Gilson faces an uphill 
battle since the DEP rejected this argument in the first two hear-
ings. 

In fact, the DEP has put a lor of time into this case over the 
last several years. Ric Pirolli, a representative from the DEP and 
head of Air Pollution Control, even made a presentation to the 
commissioner. "We're not on a side," Pirolli said. "We were just 
there ro present what we did and what actions we rook on the appli-
cation, but we did propose to grant these 
permits." This raises the question of 
whether there is an argument compelling 
enough to justify the commissioner over-
ruling his staff. Will Rocque really side-step 
the laws for the sake of a minor polluter? 

But that is not to say an argument 
does not exist. The New Haven emergency 
room admissions for asthma are among the 
highest in the state. Asthma is exacerbated 
by particulates in the air, and particulates 
are exactly what English Station will be 
spewing. Or. Mark Mitchell, President of 
the 
Connecticut 
Coalition 
for 
Environment, testified on this subject dur-
ing each 1-),earing. "As a physician, I'm say-
ing that these people are at risk-they are 
at risk for more asthma attacks, they are at 
risk for death from asthma, and because of 
the particulates in the air, they are at risk 
for sudden death from heart disease and 
respiratory disease. We would expect to see 
a significant increase in the deaths during 
the time this plant is operating." OeGeeter, 
unsurprisingly, does not see any cause for 
alarm. In fact, in the hearing before 
Deshais, QE brought in an expert to calm 
any nerves about possible health risks. The 
expert testified that the sulfides English 
Station will emit are as benign as those 
breathed in an asthma inhaler-an asser-
tion Gibson considered "egregious." 

Obviously sucking on a smokestack is 
not equivalent to puffing an inhaler, but 
even an increase in asthma rates, an issue 
that could legitimately tip the scales, is 
uncercain. Because of plants like English 
Station, which have been pumping our pol-
lutants for decades, Fair Haven already has 
an unusually high number of asthmatic 
children. But asthma is not caused by a few 
exua particulates in the air; parciculates just 
worsen the condition. So although keeping 
English Station closed might prevent a few 
additional asthma attacks, it would not 
solve the asthma problem. 

Asthma is just one component of what 
Dr. Mitchell identifies as the "English 
Station problem." English Station is an 
environmental justice issue because Fair 
Haven's ambient air quality affects poor 
blacks and Hispanics. Fair Haven is over 50 
percent Hispanic and nearly 25 percent 
black. The irony of this debacle is that on 
those hot summer days when English 
Station is spewing its particulates most 
intensely, Fair Haven residents, most of 
whom live near the plant, will be opening 
their windows wide and breath-
ing in even dirtier air.
