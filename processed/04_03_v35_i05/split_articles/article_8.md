Out of Africa 
ON A WARM AuGuST EVENING IN 1999, 
when New Haven was quiet and slow, a 
pianist from Columbus, Ohio, rook his last 
request at Amalfi Grill and stepped outside 
for a break. He walked down Temple 
Street, past the Omni Hotel, around the 
shadowy Green, and made his way back for 
his second set. Except that just past the cor-
ner, something in a window of a 
newly opened restaurant caught 
his eye, a certain fabric hanging 
from a ceiling over faces that 
somehow looked familiar. He 
p~ered in, realized chat the fabric 
and the faces were Ethiopian, 
and opened the door to soft 
lights and lentils. With a smile, 
he walked up to the man who 
was standing by the menus, and 
greeted him in Amharic. Yonas 
Asfaw, the owner of the restau-
rant, Lalibella, was taken aback. 
He had no idea chat this call man 
with a nice smile was none other 
than Charlie Sutton, the talented musician 
known in Ethiopia as the American who 
learned to play the one-stringed mesenge in 
Addis Ababa, the very man who first 
brought Ethiopian music to America near-
ly thirty-five years ago. 

This chance meeting was a wondrous 
surprise for Sutton, a "flashback," as he 
puts ic, to his days as a Peace Corps volun-
teer in Addis Ababa in the 6os. In those 
days, Ethiopia and irs music were unknown 
co most Americans, a rime when Sutton 
was strumming his guitar in his dorm at 
Harvard, and everywhere the rhythm of the 
day was swinging and shifting. The young 
musician transferred out of Harvard for 
two years to study at the Berldee School of 
Music with Andres Segovia protege 
Sophocles Papas, all the while trying to 
decide what to do next. And then, the day 
after graduation, when the walls of acade-
mia come rumbling down for every college 
student:, the 23-year-old musician, with a 
guitar and accordion in hand, boarded a 
plane bound for a Peace Corps training 
center in Salt Lake City. 

Sutton began to learn the Ethiopian , 
language of music even before he left Sale 
Lake City. He had been sitting out one 
evening, with his guitar and the Utah 
mountains for company, when his Amharic 
language teacher suddenly began to sing a 
popular Ethiopian harmony. It was the 
most haunci 
and beautiful melody 
Charlie had ever heard. Months later, in a 
darkened auditorium in Haile Selaissie 
University, the school where he caught 
English, Sutton was again mesmerized by 
the unique beauty of Ethiopian melodies. 
There before him on the stage, spinning 
these exotic melodies, was a band called 
Orchestra Erhiopia, made up of eleven 
musicians, each an expert at a particular 
traditional instrument. After the applause 
ended, Sutton approached one of the musi-
cians, Gecamesay Abbebe, to ask if he 
would teach him to play the mesenge. And 
so, Sutton, a man who now carries an 
Ethiopian joke book in his right coat pock-
et, began co learn how to make music with 
one string. 

Over the next five years, Sutton 
became a full-fledged member of Orchestra 
Ethiopia. Wearing traditional Ethiopian 
dress and carrying his second-hand mesen-
ge, he and the band traveled throughout 
the Ethiopian provinces. They played 
together in Addis Ababa hotels, enterrained 
at festivals, and even performed for the 
Emperor Haile Selassie in his royal palace. 

In some ways, you could say they helped 
keep traditional Ethiopian music alive. In 
1969, when funding for the group ran 
short, Sutton came up with the idea of a 
tour beyond the provinces to a country that 
had never heard a one-stringed instrument. 
And so that February, the Peace Corps vol-
unteer who had set out with an accordion 
and little idea of what would hap-
pen next, returned to the United 
S"cares a master of the mesenge. 

The group traveled to 20 cities, to 
Bronx college campuses, to town 
halls and high schools. And for 
three sweet minutes, Sutton and 
his band played their beautiful 
melodies on the Ed Sullivan Show 
for 40 million American viewers. 

Sitting near the window of 
Lalibella, where he and his wife 
have made a habit of dining on 
Tuesday nights, Sutton remem-
bers those days with a nostalgic 
smile. Sutton, who now calls Old 
Saybrook home, has three regular gigs now, 
and has just co-released a CD of piano jazz 
music. He still has the video of the Ed 
Sullivan show, and still sometimes plays the 
mesenge. And every Saturday night, Sutton 
sits at the upright piano at Lalibella and 
plays jazz standards, to an audience of din-
ers that may not know that the man at the 
piano once played for an Emperor.
