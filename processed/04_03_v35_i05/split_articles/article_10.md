also respectable, it did not convey the social 
currency of medicine, and many were 
seduced by that rival profession. In 
America, Sestan is also tempted by medi-
cine because it promises financial prosperi-
ty. He describes the medical students he 
teaches at Yale as lazy and uninterested; it 
seems co him chat they prefer good 
grades-the key to the coveted high 
income-to learning nature's secrets. 
This 
scientist-doctor 
dichotomy 
assumes a broad meaning for Sesran. He is 
troubled by the American lust for money; 
sometimes, he almost misses Communism. 
"There is so much social pressure here co be 
rich," he says. He knows that he is doing 
unpopular work. "Here, people say, 'Why 
be an underpaid biology grad student for 
six years? People want to make money"'-
so they stay away from science. The social 
ambitions surrounding Sestan in Croatia 
have been replaced by financial ones here, 
leaving him once again a member of a ded-
icated minority. 

In America, scientists come under a 
new kind of pressure. They are pressured to 
compete, co publish, and to be first on 
every discovery. But Sestan's passion for sci-
ence, cemented by years of hard work, has 
a special strength. "I love science, chat's 
what I want co do," Sestan says again and 
again, "and I am happy."
