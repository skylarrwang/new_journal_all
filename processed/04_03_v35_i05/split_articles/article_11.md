Reel to Real 
A SLACK GIRL COMES HOME ro find her 
stepfather sitting on a couch surrounded by 
liquor bottles, cigarette butts, and blunt 
wraps. The rwo argue about why she's skip-
ping school and getting bad grades. The 
stepfather pushes her against the wall and 
raises his belt. She cowers, covering her 
face. Outside, a police officer cuffs a loiter-
ing black teenager and pats him down. The 
cop gets in his face, and the boy shakes his 
head in fear. The camera curs again to the 
girl, who is running up to the officer. He 
blows her off with a skeptical remark, 
threatening co arrest her for interfering. 
She walks away and sits down on the curb, 
holding her hands to her face. 

In a later scene, the same police officer 
climbs out of bed in the morning and pulls 
on his dark blue socks and shiny black 
combat boots. At the same time, in his own 
bedroom, a sixteen-year-old boy pulls on 
his beige Timberland boots. The officer 
puts on his blue uniform and his badge, 
while the boy ties a belt around baggy jeans 
and pins a button on his shirt with a photo 
of his dead uncle. Later, a group of students 
corner him at his locker and pressure him 
to cut class. The police officer's superiors 
pressure him to participate in a corruption 
scheme. 

These scenes are part of a film shot by 
eight New Haven youths. The movie is half 
drama-written by the teens and scarring 
themselves and police academy cadets-
and half documentary. Starting next year, 
the New Haven Police Academy wi II use 
the film to train graduating cadets to 
respect the youth population they will 
patrol. 

Four groups collaborated on the film. 
American Beat, a local documentary film 
company, is producing, New Haven high 
school students are writing, acting, and 
directing, the New Haven Police Academy 
cadets star. But the driving force behind the 
project has been Youth Rights Media 
(YRM}, a non-profit incorporated by Yale 
Law students in 2002. 

Youth Rights Media is a group of 
twelve Yale law students who teach about a 
dozen students per year about their judicial 
rights. This year, the group has visited 
every freshman classroom in New Haven, 
giving ninety-minute presentations dealing 
with everything from Miranda rights to 
search-and-seizure laws to the conse-
quences of resisting arrest. Now YRM has 
brought police into the solution, allowing 
them to act with rhe srudents to educate 
their Academy peers. 

Most of the youths involved with the 
project have had bad experiences with the 
police or know of people who have. Shari 
Cabiness, a 17-year-old who attends 
Gateway Community college, remembers, 
"I was being harassed for loitering when 
there's no place to go but in the street. 
[When cops see you) on the corners, they 
act like there's some place co go. You can't 
even be in your community without them 
chinking you're selling drugs or making 
trouble." The problems differ by genders. 
"Males feel stigmatized by sight. Females 
are concerned abour nor being taken seri-
ously when they need the police's help, 
being thought of as hysterical," said Taylor. 

The young filmmakers compiled these 
experiences to create the script for the film. 
While the movie allows the students to 
act as teachers, they have also learned from 
production. In a classroom in the Latino 
Youth D'evelopment Center on the edge of 
the Hill neighborhood, Taylor, YRM's . 
Laura McCarger, and six high school stu-
dents plan the movie's audio, visual, and 
logistical details for six hours a week. Taylor 
stands next to a blackboard and challenges 
the group: "What's going to happen after 
the close-up on his face, Shari? What hap-
pens after a close-up of someone looking at 
something?" Meanwhile, in another room, 
set-director TaycheUe Gordino, 15, is typing 
rhe filming schedule for the students' 
spring br~k. As the set director, Gordino 
must get written permission from property 
owners to film in their buildings. Aside 
from learning the "nitry-gritry" of filmmak-
ing, the students learn how to voice their 
message. "[They are] learning the value of 
tempering and refining their point of view. 
They realize they can't just be reactionary 
and lash out at their audience because it's 
nor going to be effective," said Taylor. 

One of the most important by-prod-
ucts of the project has been the personal 
connections forged between police and 
youth during interviews and production. 
"They helped us chink about officers dif-
ferently, because they're the same people we 
are and had the same experiences we had," 
said Cabiness. 

The message of Gordino is, "T he 
badge don't make you who you are. You 
make what the badge is to you." Ideally, 
says Cabiness, "I would wane [the police] 
to learn interaction and communication 
with the youth, understanding with the 
youth, how to approach them on a differ-
ent level." It remains co be seen whether 
Gordino's message, spinning off the reels of 
American Beat, will make a difference in 
the real world.
