N Areopagitica MILTON FAMOUSLY WROTE, "Who kills a man kills 
a reasonable creature, God's image; but he who destroys a good 
book, kills reason itself, kills the image of God, as it were in the 
eye." These words, from the poet's invective against 17TH-century 
England's oppressive censorship laws, elevate books--or at least, 
"good" books-to something far r-----------------------, Human Stain, as well as in the theoreti-
grander than repositories of know!-
edge, something with a "life-blood" 
and a pulse, something that, like us, 
can die. There is something appealing, 
even seductive, about the idea of a text 
as a living being. It invites a kind of 
identification between the reader and 
the written word that holds all the 
promise of a new life, a new person to 
discover. 

In her book The Holocaust of Texts: 
Genocide, Literature, and 
Personification, Amy Hungerford, an 
assistant professor of English at Yale, 
explores the implications of texts as 
persons, or, personified texts through 
the lens of post-World War II literature, in particular, literature that deals 
with the legacy of the Holocaust. Over 
the last three decades, Hungerford 
claims, critics and readers have begun 
to regard books as embodiments of 
individual lives and even entire cultures. Viewed in these terms, the 
destruction of a text becomes not simply murder, but genocide. 

Hungerford rejects this "confla-
gration of text and person," but nonetheless acknowledges that the personification of texts has shaped our 
contemporary understanding of identity, genocide, and the ability 
of language to represent these concepts adequately. Regardless of 
whether a novel addresses these issues directly, how we perceive it is 
colored by our insistence on identifying people as members of specific racial or cultural groups-Jewish, black, female, Indian, 
Catholic, etc. In this context, a personified text assumes an identity in keeping with our notions of group classification. Hungerford 
perceives this way of thinking and reading as peculiarly postmodern. She weighs its consequences in works as diverse as Sylvia Plath's 
poem "Daddy," Art Spiegelman's Maus and Philip Roth's The 
Human Stain, as well as in the theoretical musings of critics such as Jacques 
Derrida, Paul de Man, and Jacqueline 
Rose. Hungerford debunks the presumed benefits of multiculturalism, 
namely, the assumption that a person's 
experience possesses value because of his 
or her identification with a specific cultural group-asserting that this mindset 
is both absurd and restrictive. She 
applies this thesis with penetrating 
astuteness, despite occasional lapses into 
the dense and at times impenetrable 
ruminations that characterize so much 
postmodern literary criticism. But if The 
Holocaust of Texts is typical of contemporary literary theory in this respect, the 
questions it raises are anything but ordinary. 

Hungerford demonstrates the distorting effect of personifying texts most 
effectively in her examination of critical 
reactions to Plath's "Daddy." The poem's 
speaker, an unidentified woman, 
invokes Hitler's persecution of Jews as 
an analogy to her relationship with her 
tyrannical father, explicitly identifying 
her suffering with that of Holocaust victims. Since "Daddy's" publication, readers and critics alike have decried Plath, who is neither Jewish nor a 
Holocaust survivor, for what they believe to be a shameless exploitation 
of a highly personal event. These critics demand a biographical 
connection between Plath and her writing, one that effectively limits 
the scope of her poetry to the scope of her personal experiences. 
Hungerford disagrees: With a nod to the New Critics, she rejects 
biographically influenced readings, eschewing the question "Who 
was Sylvia Plath?" in favor of "Who is Plath's writing?" With the 
poem freed from the constraints of authorial biography, the text 
itself reveals answers to identity questions-it is "both a Jewish survivor and a woman" because its language identifies with both of 
these groups. The poem has been elevated to the status of person-
hood only to be constrained by the narrow categories of "Jewish" 
and "female." The poem's personification invites the same restrictions that biographical critics imposed on Plath. As soon as it is perceived as a person, the poem loses its autonomy as a work of art 
independent of its author. 

But if personification limits Plath's poetry in undesirable ways, 
as Hungerford suggests, the consequences are even more dire when 
the text presents itself as non-fiction, as in the case of Art 
Spiegelman's Maus. Maus, a Pulitzer Prize-winning comic, chronicles 
the survival story of Spiegelman's father, using animal heads to 
depict human characters, with mouse heads for Jews and cat heads 
for Nazis. For Hungerford, this kind of representation is predictably 
repellant. Not only does it define individuals along cultural lines via 
animal heads, but these cultural identities perpetuate the legacy of 
the Holocaust. "All persons in the present," Hungerford writes, "are 
in effect identified in relation to the Holocaust ... rather than in 
relation to some other source of identity in the present." All of 
Spiegelman's characters, regardless of their personal experiences, are 
portrayed in terms of a single historical event. The author depicts 
himself as a mouse, not because he is Jewish, but because he is the 
descendent of a Jewish Holocaust survivor. The past permeates and 
defines Spiegelman's present, identifying characters with a kind of 
chilling determinism and suggesting that we will never step out of 
history's shadow. The story of Maus, then, becomes as much 
Spiegelman's as his father's. He, too, is a survivor, and the text of 
Maus is an embodiment of that survival. 

Surprisingly, Hungerford finds support for her rejection of 
identity politics in the fiction of Saul Bellow and Philip Roth. 
Whereas critics have traditionally discussed these authors in terms 
of their status as Jewish Americans, Hungerford, in a radical reinterpretation, heralds them as champions of liberated identity. In her 
view, their fiction breaks free of all constraints imposed by culture, 
family, tribe, religion, or history. To cite one example, in 
Hungerford's reading of Roth's novel The Human Stain, Coleman 
Silk, a black man who passes himself off as a white Jew, manages to 
"resist identity categorization in a very particular way." By concealing 
his cultural background, Silk maintains a vital separateness, 
making his identity "secret" and "absolutely particular." Given the 
prevalence of Jewish protagonists and the emphasis on ethnicity in 
Roth's novels, Hungerford's claim that Jewish identity, and in a 
larger sense, cultural identity, is secondary to "personal particularity" seems at best refreshing and at worst contrived. The notion that 
we are all at core dissimilar is appealing, but its presence in Roth's 
fiction still seems somewhat dubious. 

Ultimately, Hungerford argues convincingly against the seduction 
of the personified text. The quality that makes it so appealing-namely, the desire to experience another person, another identity, by experiencing the text-is exactly what constrains both post-
modern literature and literary theory. When the personal is bound 
by the restraints of multicultural categorization and the legacy of 
history, identity and capacity for creative thought suffer. By rejecting 
these narrow limitations we embrace a freer, albeit lonelier, conception of ourselves. We can never truly share the experience of 
another living being, whether that being is conceived as a person or 
a personified text, because in the end, we are unique, "particular all 
the way down." In exchange for relinquishing our fantasy of the living text, we are given back our imagination.
