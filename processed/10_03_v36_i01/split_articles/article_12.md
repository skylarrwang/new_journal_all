MIN also offers legal advice to fathers try-
ing to rejoin their families. Herein lies the 
greatest challenge for MIN. The definition of 
family in the state of Connecticut has essen-
tially "reduced fathers to a paycheck," claims 
Mr. Kimbro. His network challenges the 
courtroom perception of estranged fathers as 
"deadbeats," by fighting for the rights of 
those who are not aware of their obligations 
as claimed paten. "Some of these men need to 
be reprogrammed as to what their role as men 
is," Kimbro said. 

At first, Kimbro took his fight to the 
streets. He would sit in his parked car outside 
one of the most "notorious housing develop-
ments in New Haven," and try to recruit men 
who looked in need of help. That was six 
years ago. Today, as MIN's project coordinator, 
Kimbro deals with administrative issues, and 
works cowards improving the delivery of 
social services as a whole. In the last quarter, 
115 men were enrolled in MIN, and in the last 
month and a half, MIN has gained another 40 
clients. Mr. Kimbro stressed the mental 
aspect of the development program, arguing 
that for decades African Americans have had 
a cultural aversion to accessing mental health 
and clinical services, explaining. "With 
poverty, comes unhealthy and dysfunctional 
behavior," he told me. 

The lessons caught in MIN may seem 
ridiculously basic, reminiscent of an awkward 
middle school health class. And, indeed, these 
fathers are nurtured as if they were children. 
But it is all a part of Kimbro's plan, a sort of 
cyclical approach where he treats f.uhers as 
they ought to treat their own children. A trip 
to the zoo, or that first breakthrough that 
OCcurs between a child and his father, vali-
dates MIN's mission. The simple lessons are 
what linger and resonate in people's lives and 
communities.

**Title: New Haven's Music Scene**

here is something shaking New Haven. It is big enough to swal-
low up faith, politics, and maybe even the universe. Two local 
guys claim to understand ir. They are harnessing the power of 
music co pur New Haven on the culniral ma~ne by exponing local 
talent and the ocher by bringing national talent in. An artistic revolu-
tion may be just around the corner-or so they say. 

One of these venues is The Space, leased and operated by Steve 
Rodgers, rhe man set on releasing local talent to the nation. Rodgers 
has jet black hair, tattoos, spits when he smokes, and looks just weath-
ered enough co be credible. Bur his appearance is deceiving: Hipster he 
may be, bur he is first and foremost rhe son of Peter Rodgers, former 
preacher at St. John's Episcopal Church on Humphrey Street, and a 
recendy born-again Christian. He works as the music director for a 
church and is active with a Christian mission group. After troubles with 
alcohol, Steve said he cleaned up and found what he needed just 
around rhe corner, literally. The Space is only a few minutes from where 
he lives and just blocks from where his father praised God rwice a week 
for 35 years. Ir is his salvation and a natural extension of his father's 
good work-Steve, like his dad, is interested in building a community. 

Bur unlike Reverend Rogers, Steve ministers to a congregation that 
worships music. As one Space patron pur it, "Some people go co 
church, bur my church is right here on Tuesday nights." 

New Haven's other burgeoning music mecca, BAR, located on 
Crown Street, could not be mistaken for a church, and Rick Omante, 
its new promoter, is unlikely to be mistaken for a rock star. But he was 
one: His old band Spring Heeled Jack usA played the Warped Tour, 
toured internationally and cur rwo full length records. Despite his 
whirlwind past, the former hipster has a young face and an irreverent 
attitude. "I'm convinced my pact with the devil keeps me looking 
young," he jokes. After his band broke up, he came to New Haven and 
starred booking Sunday night shows for BAR. In his shore tenure, rhe 
club has gone from hosting open mics co attracting national aces-a 
formidable accomplishment. But still more work must be done if Rick 
plans co resurrect New Haven as a musically important ciry, lee alone 
have it surpass what it once was.

cw Haven's claim to national prominence has nor always been 
so tenuous. Forry years ago, The Schubert was a testing ground 
for Broadway shows. Thirry years ago, Toad's drew the likes of 
Bob Dylan, BB King, and the Rolling Stones. Until recendy, rhe Tune 
Inn, a club located on Center Street near the newly redeveloped Ninth 
Square, was the epitome of hip. W ith room for 500, Tune Inn lines 
often coiled around the block. Owner Fernando Pinke brought in 
everything from industry giants like Nirvana to indie darlings like the 
Dismemberment Plan. "It was a dump, and it was awesome," remem-
bers Omanre. "It was just what you'd expect-bath rooms didn't work, 
stickers everywhere, weirdo people working the door." Sadly, the Tune 
Inn, in all its glory, was a doomed venture. O ur of sync with the aims 
of the Nimh Square developers, fire marshals and cops began turning 
up at concerts with measuring tape and concerns about capaciry. In 
2001, the last holdout from New Haven's once great music scene closed 
its doors. 

Memories of these good old days still inspire some, though, and 
the Tune Inn's furniture, at least, is being put to good use. The Space 
acquired the old bar from the Tune Inn, which spores a "Fernando's 
Liquor" sign in the far corner. But there is no boozing at The Space. 
Nor is there smoking, misbehaving, or talking. The Space is different-
"Nighr and day from the Tune Inn," says Rick. "Like if J dropped an 
M&M on the floor ofThe Space, I would probably pick it up and eat it. 
O r at lease I wouldn't have a problem picking ir up off the ground. At 
the Tune Inn, you know, it hie the ground and you left it for dead. Even 
if your friend fell over, you wouldn't pick anybody up once they hit the 
ground." 

Bur cleanliness isn't the only characteristic that separates the rwo 
venues. The music scene Steve envisions for New Haven will be order· 
ly in a way that the Tune Inn never was. Steve describes The Space as 
"a classroom with velvet lights." Like in any classroom, there are lots of 
rules, the most notable of which are printed on pocket-sized fliers sit-
ting on a card table that serves as the ticker booth: "No drugs or alco-
hol allowed; No smoking inside; Dispose of gum in the crash (not on 
rhe floor); No fighting (even verbally); No rough playing."
