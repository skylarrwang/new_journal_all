Heading into the bottom of the sixth inning on the evening of 
September 10, the New Haven Ravens trailed the Akron Aeros 
by a score of 9-0. The emerging story line seemed all too famil-
iar: Things forever getting drearier. This was the second game of the 
Double-A Eastern League Championship Series, the last baseball game 
the Ravens would ever play in New Haven. In January, a group of 
Massachusetts businessmen purchased the Ravens, a minor league 
afftliate of the Toronto Blue Jays, and announced that they would 
move the franchise to Manchester, NH, at the end of the year. 

Attendance, which had been dwindling since 1995, plummeted to 
record lows. To cut costs, the team cancelled its radio broadcasts for 
the season, opting to broadcast games only via the internet. A month 
into the season, however, they cut the internet broadcasts as well. With 
almost mocking irony, the Ravens went on to clinch its first division 
title in its 10-year history, and General Manager Adam Schierholz con-
vinced rwo local businesses to sponsor the team's postseason, making 
all playoff tickets free to the public. The parting gift appeared to be a 
fmal act of kindness for Ravens' fans-or at least a fool-
proof way to fill the seats. But as Schierholz sur-
veyed the crowd at Yale Field that night, his 
team weU on its way to dropping its second 
game of the championship, it appeared that 
his generous promotion had failed. Only 5,235 
fans had attended the game, and, by the mid-
dle of the sixth inning. a third had already 
left, believing they'd finally gotten their 
money's worth. 

I was among those who stayed. Growing up, I had always rooted 
against the Ravens, a team founded in 1993 as part of the farm system 
for the Colorado Rockies, a Major League expansion dub. The same 
year, a new Eastern League team moved into my hometown of 
Portland, ME-The Sea Dogs, the Double-A affiliate of the Florida 
Marlins. So I grew up a Sea Dogs fan, and always hated seeing the 
Ravens come to town, because, most of the time, they beat my beloved 
home team. Those dastardly Ravens and their winning ways became 
an inside joke among my friends. But although I had always prayed for 
the Ravens to fail on the field, I never wished them ill will as a fran-
chise. Partly co pay my last respects to a worthy enemy, partly out a 
love of the game, and partly out of my nagging curiosity, I went to Yale 
Field that night to see how a baseball team died, and to see how the 
community, notorious for its indifference, would react. 

Schierholz stood in the press box, watching disaster unfold on the 
field, his eyes panning empty rows of grandstand seats. "We're disap-
pointed," he told me quietly. "We're giving away free rickets and still 
the stadium's only half fUll." Half-full stadiums-or worse--were the 
norm this year for the Ravens. The team drew only 140,000 fans the 
entire season, while the New Britain Rock Cats, a rival Eastern League 
team in Connecticut, broke its own single-season attendance record 
for the fourth consecutive year, topping 268,000. There were a million 
reasons why the Ravens were a diseased franchise in New Haven, 
Schierholz said. The most common excuses floating around the stadi-
um and the sports pages were that Yale Field was an outdated facility; 
the tearn"路tacked significant political or corporate support from the 
town; New York and Boston were more attractive venues to see base-
ball; the team lacked a coherent identity, bearing New Haven's name 
but playing on a West Haven field owned by Yale. Secretly, I wondered 
if perhaps New Haven thought itself too sophisticated to support a 
working man's game. But whatever the root cause, an overwhelming 
apathy had settled around the Ravens. I asked Schierholz If he had tried 
to keep the team in New Haven, since he would lose his job when the 
Ravens headed north. He replied without a trace of discernible sadness: 
"No attempts." Schierholz seemed impatient for the end, ready per-
haps to forget his personal responsibility for a team that was now down 
by nine runs. It seemed to me that the team had long been dead to 
New Haven. The words, "Thank you fans, 1994-2003," chalked into 
foul territory along the base paths looked 
particularly morbid. 

But at that moment, the flounder-
ing black birds rallied their strength for 
one final Sap toward victory. The Ravens 
picked up rwo runs in the bottom of the 
sixth and five more in an exhilarating bot-
tom of the eighth, bringing the score to 9-7, and the 
paltry crowd finally came alive. When the Ravens 
路brought the potential eying run to the plate in the bottom 
of the ninth with rwo outs, the fans reached a rare state of euphoria. 
One man removed his shoe and started "whapping it against the alu-
minum benches, while others shouted, stomped, and chanted. Some 
even prayed. The crowd's desire for the Ravens to end on a soaring, 
improbable high note was almost tangible. But on a 2-2 pitch, in front 
of a crowd on its feet, mighty Tyrell Goodwin struck out. 

Yet instead of dejected fans shuffiing from the stadium, an unex-
pected celebration ensued. Schierholz and the Ravens staff invited 
everyone down to the field for "one final fun run" around the bases, an 
activity usually reserved fo_r kids after home games. But that night 
everyone funneled onto the field, as if unconsciously filling die void 
left by that last strikeout. A strange infectious force began to rise out of 
the fans as they approached the infield. Everyone circled the bases, 
some jogging, some walking. some scoring the winning run in the sev-
enth game of their imaginary World Series. Schierholz stood a few feer 
up the third base line, slapping high fives to fans that used to root for 
a baseball team here. A few people required more路 than a high five, 
embracing Schierholz with tear-streaked cheeks. One woman larehed 
on for a long hug, confiding. "My husband's heart is being ripped out." 
Then people spread into the outfield and foul territory, searching for 
the perfect spot to internalize the moment and contribute in a person-


**Clean Elections in New Haven**
**Page number(s): 22-23**

In the 2001 New Haven mayoral primaries, incumbent John 
DeStefano, Jr., and Connecticut State Senator Martin Looney 
competed for the Democratic Party nomination like two siblings 
in a Monopoly game. Having served four consecutive terms as mayor, 
DeStefano already owned all the prime real estate and was raking in 
rental fees with every role of the dice. Checks made out to "DeStefano 
for Mayor" poured in from school administrators, police unions, city 
employees, and local contractors--a testament to DeStefano's well-
oiled fundraising machine. In the primaries alone, he managed to raise 
over $550,000 in contributions. Without DeStefano's incumbent edge, 
Looney was sitting on a considerably lighter campaign coffer, but still 
had enough political clout to give 
DeStefano a run for his money. A 
New Haven native, Looney had 
represented the Elm City in the 
Connecticut General Assembly 
from 1980-1992 before going on to 
become a five-term state senator. 
In his most recent senatorial cam-
paign, he had spent over $40,000. 
For the mayoral primary, he raised 
路 five times that amount. 

Besides putting a handsome 
feather in his cap, instituting 
clean elections could prove 
immeasurably useful for some-
one with larger aspirations. 

all-out war: Fundraising on both sides surged to levels never before 
seen in any city in Connecticut. By September ll, the day New York's 
financial center collapsed, the New Haven mayoral primary had 
amassed more than $800,000 in campaign contributions. After 
DeStefano beat Looney by a margin of 24 percent, new partisan oppo-
nents brought even more money to the race. One month after the 
Democratic primary, the candidates' total campaign contributions 
amounted to more than $1,000,000-making this by far the most 
apensive election in New Haven's history. In a city where registered 
Democrats outnumber Republicans 13 to 1, no one was panicularly 
surprised when DeStefano won. It was his spending that was so 
unnerving. Even more shocking 
was the fact that only 18 percent, 
or 27 of DeStefano's 149 contrib-
utors, lived within the New 
Haven city limits. Rumors of 
unfairness began to circulate. 

It was in this contat, in the 
days following his inauguration, 
that DeStefano suddenly changed 
course. Claiming that he was fed 
up with raising money, he adopt-
ed the platform of his former 
opponent Looney: Campaign finance reform. If he succeeds, within a 
year New Haven may become the first city in Connecticut, and the 
founeenth in the country, to publicly finance municipal elections. A 
group comprised of the Mayor and a handful of aldermen is currendy 
pushing to bring into law a "Clean Elections Bill." The hope is that the 
bill will prevent the acessive spending that characterized the 2001 elec-
tion from happening again and encourage those without adequate 
resources or political clout to participate in what has traditionally been 
a closed political process. In other words, this is a bill that could revo-
lutionize New Haven politics. 


With stakes this high, and 
with money in hand, what began as friendly compennon soon 
devolved into nasty squabbling. When Looney staged a fundraiser at 
the home of former State Democratic Chairman Edward Marcus, 
DeStefano lost no time pointing out that Marcus' law firm represent-
ed a housing development corporation under investigation by the FBI 
for misallocation of federal funds. In retaliation, Looney attacked 
DeStefano for his own campaign tactics. Calling for campaign finance 
reform, he accused DeStef.uto of squeezing contributions from people 
through intimidation. He alluded to one particular fundraising invita-
tion DeStefano had sent out to city employees and contractors, 
denouncing its language as "coercive." In addition, Looney claimed 
that DeStefano's citywide network of supponers sent the message that 
"the city is for sale and continues to be for sale." DeStef.uto quickly 
reacted by emphatically pointing out how he had rejected $1.750 from 
Sal Brancati, a former director of New Haven's Office of Business 
Development who had been accused of accepting $65,500 in bribes 
from the owner of a financial planning firm in achange for sending 
him business. 

Ultimately, neither candidate was actually able to find anything 
illegal about the other's fundraising strategies in this high stakes game. 
Emotions nevertheless ran high and the campaign morphed into an


o realize his vision of "clean elections," DeStefano appointed 
his aecutive assistant Julio Gonzalez, cc '99 to draft a bill and 
amass the necessary suppon to get it passed. In his Yale days, 
Gonzalez had served as New Haven's Ward 1 alderman. After gradua-
tion, he joined forces with DeStefano, working as his campaign man-
ager in 2001 and as his primary political advisor after the election. 
Throughout the campaign Gonzalez's press-saviness had distinguished 
him from the other advisors. When reponers confronted路 DeStefano 
about contentious issues, more often than not the mayor passed the 
questions to Gonzalez. According to Gonzalez, the mayor took up the 
clean elections cause at least pardy in response to concerns expressed by 
alderman Vincent Mauro about his fundraising methods in the fall 
2001 campaign. "The mayor felt strongly that we needed to change the 
system," Gonzalez said. "We started asking, what is a meaningful 
reform that will solve these problems and allow free speech?" 

Gonzalez enlisted the aid of Ward 29 Alderman Carl Goldfield, 
another one of DeStefano's political advisors, to help draft the Clean 
Elections Bill. Together, they assembled a diverse wk force of civic-
minded citizens, including Joe Jolly, a Fair Haven resident and employ-
ee of the Peabody Museum; Elizabeth Adonizio, a Yale political science 
graduate student and member of the League of Women Voters, and 
Ray Weber and Lee Cruz, both of the New Haven Environmental 
Justice Nerwork. In the ensuing months, the team devised a bill that 
outlined the establishment of what they called the "New Haven 
Democracy Fund." The city's annual budget would allocate at least 
$100,000 to the fund, costing taxpayers roughly 80 cents per yea~, 
making it one of the smallest line items in the New Haven budget. 

The process would be fairly straightforward: Candidates seeking 
public funding would first be required to raise 200 donations of 
between $25 and $300 each, at which point they would qualify for a 
$15,000 block grant. They would then receive funds matching those 
they had already raised rwo to one, up to $200,000. Every additional 
dollar they raised would be matched up to $200,000. If a privately 
funded candidate's spending exceeded $200,000, publicly funded can-
didates would have the choice of either receiving an additional $25,000 
grant from the Democracy Fund or raising funds independently. 

Despite the apparent temptation for candidates with political 
clout and independent resources to bypass public fmancing, other 
cities with similar systems have shown that even well-connected candi-
dates usually find it in their best interest to take advantage of public 
funds. In addition to saving a candidate money, public financing gives 
the appearance of democratic fair play. Because the u.s. Consitution 
protects campaign contributions as free speech, there will always be 
individuals like New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, who can afford 
both to outspend public funds and to suffer the bad publicity that goes 
along with it. But at least at the local level, the Bloombergs are more 
often the exception than the rule. 

Gonzalez admits that the Clean Elections Bill will be difficult lo 
implement. The major obstacle to public fmancing is that political 
incumbents are often reluctant to advocate a system that would under-
mine their existing nerwork of financial supporters. Out of $53,379 that 
DeStefano raised during the third quarter of 2003, at least $26,985 
carne from executives at contracting firms, including companies work-
ing on the city's $1.5 billion construction program. School developers, 
Long Wharf Mall consultants, and demolishers paid thousands of dol-
lars for a piece of the mayoral pie. Gonzalez and the wk force are nev-
ertheless pushing the idea publicly. According to Gonzalez. "[We are] 
organizing public hearings and neighborhood meetings with the hope 
of convincing people that clean elections are good for everyone." 

ohn DeStefano's motivation to undetake a project like the 
Clean Elections Bill is, to say the least, unclear. It is hard to 
believe that DeStefano would bite the hands that have funded 
him for so long. But besides putting a handsome feather in his cap, 
instituting clean elections as the five-term mayor of a small city could 
prove immeasurably useful for someone with larger aspirations. 

Whatever DeStefano's ultimate agenda, the bill faces a more 
immediate obstacle: The state has effectively vetoed it. Once 
DeStefano's team fmished drafting the bill in late 2002, they petitioned 
the Connecticut legislature for "enabling legislation," without which 
the bill would be vulnerable to lawsuits challenging its constitutional-
ity. Withour pull at the state level, the odds of passing enabling legis~ 
lation were formidable. But the bill faced more than mere lack of 
influence. After losing the 2001 primaries, Martin Looney had 
returned ro his post as State senator in Hartford and become House 
Majority Leader. Formerly a firm supporter of public finance reform, 
Looney did not openly oppose DeStefano's bill, but when the request 
for enabling legislation came before the Senate, he did not lift a finger 
to support it. In January 2003, the bill was referred to the Joint 
Committee on Government Administration and Elections, where it 
may remain indefinitely. 

DeStefano is in his fifth two-year term and campaigning for a 
sixth. After stay-ing in the saddle during some of New Haven's rockiest 
rimes, he may be confident that he can stay there as long as he wants. 
But according to Gonzales, "He's closer to the end than the beginning. 
So clean elections will affect the transition between DeStefano and the 
next mayor. The reason we engage it is because we like having the 
fights, we like the competition," claims Gonzalez. "We want to have a 
system that is healthy and works well." A more skeptical analysis of his 
motives would cast DeStefano as a successful self-promoter. If he is 
aimiilg for higher office, having enacted the first Clean Elections sys-
tem in Connecticut would be an invaluable asset.
