hIS A CRAY AFTERNOON, and Ernesto Zedillo 
Rands at the front of a packed campus audi-
torium ready to speak. The former President 
of Mexico and current head of the Yale 
Center for the Study of Globalization is slat-
ed to enlighten the audience with a rigorous 
diaecrion of the collapse of the September 
World Trade Organization (wro} conference 
ia Cancun. He gets straight to the point: 
~2003 
Free trade is good, and the Western World 
has abandoned the cause. With stately poise, 
he castigates the United States as "foolish," 
even "incompetent," and demands a renewed 
commitment ro laissa.-foire capitalism. 

Zedillo's speech confirms a fact that has 
become glaringly obvious in recent months: 
The Globalization Center does not exist to 
study globalization so much as to exalt it. 
Since ZediUo began his tenure last spring, the 
Center has committed itself to spreading the 
gospel of the free market. The question at 
hand for ZediUo and his colleagues is not 
whether globalization is good or bad, real or 
imagined, but how it can most quickly and 
effectively be realized so as to shower us all 
with its gifts-economic stabilization, allevia-
tion of poverty, world peace. The Center's 
decidedly ideological aim is meant to go hand 
in hand with the expansion of the University 
itselÂ£ Yale founded the center primarily to 
attract international scholars and students 
and to extend Yale's relevance beyond 
America's borders. 

In choosing a direccor it would have 
been hard to come up with a more controver-
sial choice than Zedillo. His presidency in 
Mexico was riddled with corruption. His 
party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party 
(PRJ), is notorious for having laid the 
groundwork for the effiorescence of 
the narcotics trade, Mexico's largest 
and most profitable industry. The 
details of Zedillo's 
alleged 
crooked dealings are hazy at 
Publicly, he is considered 
an outsider, a good man who 
came into power accidentally (he 
stepped in at the last minute to run for the 
presidency in 1994 when PRJ candidate Luis 
Donaldo Colosio, whose campaign Zedillo 
ran, was murdered) and took a hard-line 
stance against drugs and government corruP' 
tion, despite alleged ties berween members of 
his administration and narco-traffickers. 

Beneath the public veneer, however, 
whispers abound. Soon afrer his election, the 
United States' Drug Enforcement Agency 
(oEA) alleged that the president received $40 
million from the Cali cartel for his campaign; 
Zedillo immediately denied the allegation 
(and, mysteriously, the DEA followed suit 
shortly thereafter). Another U.S. investiga-
tion in 1998 tipped off by drug lords uncov-
ered a possible link berween Zedillo and a 
multi-billion 
dollar 
money-laundering 
scheme. His family, too, has been implicated. 
Zedillo's former drug czar, afrer being impris-
oned for corruption, told a judge in 1997 that 
he once investigated Zedillo's relatives for 
connections to the business; rumors have his 
brother dealing methamphetamines. 

Whatever the extent of ZediJio's direct 
involvement in the Mexican drug trade, one 
thing seems clear: His government was cor-
rupt, and it could not have functioned any 
other way. Mexico runs on drugs. The market 
infiltrates every corner of its society, making 
the idea of clean politics in Mexico meaning-
less. Journalist C harles Bowden, who has 
written extensively about the drug war, put it 
to me bluntly: "There is no yardstick for hon-
esty down there." 

Critics of Zedillo miss the point when 
they charge that a former backroom politician 
is too dishonest to lead the Globalization 
Center. To the contrary, Zedillo is extremely 
well qualified to lead a center committed to 
liberalizing global trade: He is a man who 
understands first-hand the workings and 
power of one of the world's only ttue free 
markets, one which has brought immense 
wealth imo a country that wouJd otherwise 
be devastated by poverty. 

In that sense, the Globalization Cemer 
may be one of the most covertly radical 
think-tanks in the country. In a recent article 
in YakG/.obaL Onlin~ that he wrote to accom-
pany his talk on the wro, Zedillo does not 
hide the grandiose plans that lie at the back of 
his mind. "The international communiry," he 
writes, "should set itself a goal that the world 
should be free of aJI barriers to trade in goods 
and services by no later than 2025." These 
staid words may sound innocuous in the 
stuffy pages of a universiry magazine, but we 
should not underestimate the political will 
that lies behind them.
