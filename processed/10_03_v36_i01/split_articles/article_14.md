EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
It's clear that money is not what's driving 
either of these two hopeful revolutionaries. In 
addition to BAR, Rick works three jobs at the 
School of Architecture to support this "labor 
oflove." Steve is putting in 60, 70, and sometimes 
80 hour weeks at The Space, but he too 
also holds several other jobs to support him-
self and his wife. "I was never in it for the 
money; if I were I would have quit in 1992," 
Steve says. 


Perhaps the pay off is merely pushing this 
city to the cusp and watching what hap-
pens. Both promoters decided long ago that 
music is a force that can be controlled, 
manipulated, and used to power change. 
Steve may bring notoriety to this town by 
building a music community, currently a tiny 
but devoted group that takes a chance on 
local artists every week. "I've always wanted 
to see people get together for a positive thing. 
People rally against stuff all the time, but you 
never see people coming together for some-
thing or just to be with people." He has chan-
neled music to build a community, but ultimately 
it is relationships, not music, that hold 
it together. 


Rick has something else in mind. He sees 
music as a means of changing people. For 
Rick, the more lives changed, the more "slam-
min'" this town will be. "The first time Dead 
Meadow played at BAR a lot of people had 
never heard of them, it was probably the most 
crowded I've ever had that room. I'm positive 
it changed people's lives. Jaws were on the 
ground. Eyes were tearing and you know peo-
ple were just floored. People were just amazed 
that like these three skinny young dudes 
could just belt out this sonic wall. That is the 
juice into the vein," he said gripping his fore-
arm, "That is what I'm booking shows for." 


But sweeping revolution has yet to 
engulf New Haven. Rick and Steve have not 
overthrown the cultural pecking order of 
New England. And New Haven's music scene 
still cannot hold a candle to New York's. But 
the belief that music has the power to trans-
form lives might just be revolutionary enough 
to light the fire.
