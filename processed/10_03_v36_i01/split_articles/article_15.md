n the small kitchen attached to the com-
munity room of a massive apartment com-
plex, Jorge's wife stood stirring a big pot of 
boiling broth filled with pasulu, a combina-
cion, she explained, of vegetables, potatoes 
and chunks of tender meat, all rolled into 
ucca leaves and wrapped in paper tied with 
tring. "Don't worry, though" she said with a 
smile. "We mke the paper off." The ocher 
dishes were already laid out on rhe table: 
couscous, chicken, rice and beans, and, the 
fastest to disappear, a tender blend of pork 
and onions. 

Across the room, Jorge and Gilberto 
in continual revolutions around the 
table, Jorge still trying to explain to Eric 
his own special rules for calling rhe eight-ball; 
Luis and Alberto manned a small round table 
covered with dominoes; and outside, occa-
sionally tapping their cigarette ends into a 
plastic cup drained of its un-na, the others 
were talking, their words drifting off into the 
warm air of a Saturday night in Fair Haven. 

In houses across the city, there was much 
cause for celebration the weekend of 
September 20: After three and a half long 
weeks on strike, members of Yale locals 34 
and 35 would be back at work by Monday, 
flush with the triumph of a new contract that 
promised higher wages and better pensions. 

But no one in the crowd at 50 Grand Avenue 
was a union member. In fact, as of Monday 
morning, none of them would even be 
employed. 

The road that runs between this pre-
dominantly Hispanic immigrant neighbor-
hood and Yale is not an easy path to trod: 
Though Hispanics make up more than a fifth 
of the city's population, they hold only three 
percent of University jobs. And even those 
who do succeed in penetrating the ranks of 
Yale employees are ultimately shortchanged 
in the benefits they receive. Although the 
University offers some employees assistance 
through its much vaunted Homebuyer's 
Program, the program does not cover any 
houses bought in Fair Haven. Thus chances 
seemed pretty slim that any of the ten Puerto 
Rican, Mexican and Peruvian-Americans 
enjoying the party that day would ever bene-
fit from the unions' triumph. The absence of 
anyone at the gathering from the local 
unions, much less the University administra-
tion, did not improve matters. 

But the pasulu and stewed pork told a 
different story, and the people enjoying them-Jorge Rivera, Angie Aponte, Luis 
Loyola, 
Alberto 
Mendieta, 
Gilberto 
Cintrone, Luis Velazquez, Marta Ramos, 
Pablo Soto, Anibal Garcia, and Laura 
Hernandez-saw a different future at Yale. 

They knew firsthand what a place on the 
University's dining hall or custodial staff 
would look like. For several weeks, they had 
each held a temporary job through a sub-
contracting 
firm 
called 
Sanitation 
Management, cleaning residential colleges 
and dining halls at Yale in place of striking 
members of Local 35. These were highly cov-
eted positions, even though, as sub-contrac-
tors, the workers did not enjoy union pay or 
benefits, and they accepted the job knowing 
that when the strike ended, they would be 
forced to give it up. With this in mind, a 
week before their party, the ten workers 
made a surprising career move for people on 
their rung of the employment ladder: They 
went on strike. 

THis New Haven

Instead of mopping stairwells or cleaning 
bathrooms, the ten joined union members 
on the picket lines to protest the injustices 
of an employer for whom, technically, they 
had never worked. It seemed an unlikely way 
to get a foot in the door at Yale. But then, 
after years of fruitless efforts on the part of 
New Haven's Hispanic community to forge 
closer relations with the city's largest employ-
er, extreme measures seemed necessary. 

Weeks later, the most surprising part of 
the decision is not that ten people, most of 
whom had never met, banded together to 
walk away from a job with better wages than 
any of them had earned in months, or that 
they all left all in the hope of blazing a trail 
into the unions whose picket lines they had 
just been breaking. Rather, the most remark-
able twist in this story is that it just might 
have worked. 

To hear union leaders tell it, Yale has a 
deeply institutionalized bias against 
hiring Hispanic workers. Even the paltry 
three or four percent Hispanic workforce 
that the University boasts of employing 
includes, according to one union member, 
"every half-Spanish professor or part-timer 
they could find." 

So for the last two years, the unions, 
through their political arm, The Connecticut 
Center for a New Economy, have lobbied as 
part of the "Social Contract with Yale" cam-
paign to extend employment to more 
Hispanic workers. Leading the effort is Dan 
Smolderon, whose fresh face and brightly 
colored yarmulke are a frequent sight at 
churches and community meetings through-
out Fair Haven. When Smolder first began 
organizing in Fair Haven two years ago, he 
was shocked to find that in a city where one 
in four workers is employed by the 
University, almost none came from the 
Hispanic community. Things have come a 
long way since then. This summer, for exam-
ple, a group of Hispanic clergymen whom 
Smolder had organized met with Yale 
President Rick Levin to discuss hiring and 
promotional opportunities for Hispanic 
workers. The results of these efforts are diffi-
cult to tabulate. According to the Office of 
New Haven and State Affairs, the number of 
Hispanic employees at the University has 
increased 39 percent in the last five years, 
while the total workforce has grown by only 
9 percent. Five of eight trainees in the current 
class at the New Haven Residents' Training 
Program are Hispanic. Some anecdotal evi-
dence suggests that this hiring binge might 
have been concentrated within the last six 
months, as a mounting press campaign left 
the University scrambling to mask its historic 
paucity of Hispanic workers. 

Still, to most observers, efforts to inte-
grate the workforce have remained the same 
for decades, as evidenced by the workforce's 
racial stratification. Black workers clean the 
floors, white managers oversee them, and 
Hispanic faces are nowhere to be found. 

All of that changed, though, on August 
27, when Yale's unions began their ninth 
labor action in 35 years. Soon afterwards, 
busloads of predominantly Puerto Rican and 
Mexican 
workers 
began 
arriving 
in 
unmarked vans each day to take up the 
mops and trash bags the strikers had left 
behind. The sub-contractors offered Yale an 
unmistakable advantage: They accepted 
lower wages, no benefits, and no guarantee 
as to the duration of their employment. 

Union leaders, of course, were out-
raged. To them, it was obvious that Yale was 
taking advantage of the Hispanic workers 
not only because they were immigrants, a 
historically vulnerable group, but also 
because they were not a group traditionally 
employed at Yale and thus not likely to iden-
tify with the strikers. Some of the union 
workers, it turned out, did not identify with 
the sub-contracted workers either. One 
evening during the strike, for example, stu-
dents reported hearing striking union mem-
bers shouting, "Go back to Mexico!" as the 
sub-contracted workers stepped off the 
bus. 

At a press conference during the second 
week of the strike, the unions convened 40 
Hispanic and African-American clergy and 
representatives of the National Hispanic 
Caucus to denounce the University's alleged 
effort to exploit racial tensions. One clergy-
man told the New Haven Register that the 
Hispanic strike-breakers were, "by igno-
rance, being given scraps." 

Yale officials begged to differ. They 
insisted that the University was only trying 
to fulfill its educational mission, without
