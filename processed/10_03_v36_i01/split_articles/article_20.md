lfTolstoy were alive today one can spec-
ulate that he would be more than pleased to 
see the ways in which this epitaph manifests 
itself in the lives of his fellow characters on 
stage. One of the more touching moments of 
forgiveness takes place between Santiago and 
Ofelia. After Santiago has gambled away 
much of the f.unily's money, he asks Ofelia, 
"Have I lost you?" to which she responds, "If 
you had lost me, I wouldn't be here. If you 
had lost me, I wouldn't be by your side. How 
can you say that you've lost me?" Tolstoy's 
epitaph, it seems, has followed him onto the 
stage. 


Add to this Tolstoy's interest in games as 
literary devices, and it is even more apparent 
why he is well cast. Readers of Anna Karmina 
will remember the many colorful scenes of 
horse-gambling, croquet-playing, card-cajol-
ing, and chess-maneuvering. It is appropriate 
then that the play in which Tolstoy appears 
commences with a cock-fight-a contest 
whose outcome is determined by forces out-
side of the individuals' control-and revolves 
partly around a character with a penchant for 
gambling. 


Finally, and perhaps less overdy, Tolstoy's 
opinions on mechanization and its corrupt-
ing influence neady parallel those embodied 
in Anna in th~ Tropics. In Anna Karmina, 
Tolstoy creates a near-utopian realm in the 
Russian countryside, which for his character, 
Levin, is "the place of life, that is, of joy, suf-
fering, labor." It is here that Levin, who 
"despises and hates the city and city-
dwellers," experiences utter happiness while 
mowing the fields: 
The longer Levin mowed, the ltlore 
often he felt those moments of obliv-
ion during which it was no longer his 
arms that swung the scythe, but the 
scythe itself that lent motion to his 
whole body, full of life and conscious 
of itself, and, as if by magic, without a 
thought of it, the work got riglidy and 
neady done on its own. 
THE NEW joURNAL 


Tolstoy is thus well-placed in a play that 
also examines the two contrasting realms of 
modern technology and nature, and ultimate-
ly falls on the side of nature. These realms are 
less well-defined in Anna in tht Tropics, deci-
pherable only through the characters allu-
sions to a park in the middle of a city where 
time slows and the pace of life is at its best, 
free of the threat of machines. Tolstoy would 
likely find himself in good company with 
Juan Julian, who admits: 
I don't really like cities. In the country 
one has freedom ... as my father used 
to say, living in a city is like living 
inside the mouth of a crocodile, 
buildings all around you like teeth. 
The teeth of culture, the mouth and 
tongue of civi.liz.ation. Every time I go 
to a park, I'm reminded of how we 
always go back tO nature. 


Thus, when Cheche, Santiago's brother, 
calls for "Modernity, Progress, Advancement," 
Juan Julian, speaking almost as if channeling 
Tolstoy's own Levin, responds, "The ttuth is 
that machines, cars, are keeping us from tak-
ing walks and sitting on park benches, smok-
ing a cigar slowly and calmly." Tolstoy, it 
seems, would approve. 


Next month, when the lights go up, the 
curtains go down, and the actors march on 
stage for the opening act of Anna in tht 
Tropics, audiences will see for themselves how 
Tolstoy rues as a character. Those seated in 
the darkness will find themselves in a rare 
moment in which the voices of two literary 
masters will carry them up outside the walls 
of the present and into worlds that reflect 
their own.
