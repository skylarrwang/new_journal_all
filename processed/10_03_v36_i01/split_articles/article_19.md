**Title: Casting Tolstoy**
**Author: Nilo Cruz**
**Page number(s): 26-27**

A long time ago, when the city was new 
:.J""'\!"d hemmed in by swamp, the voices 
of authors dead but still revered arose 
in the cigar factories of Ybor City, Florida. 

The stories usually came in the afternoon, as 
the sun fell through the windows. By that 
time, most of the 
cigar rollers would 
have already finished 
five hundred or so 
cigars and the f.lcto-
ries, then empty of 
machines, would be 
quiet, save for the 
sounds of the stories. 

The cigar 
rollers, 
some of them illiter-
ate, 
all of them 
skilled 
and 
classics in the afternoon, ,as fmgers silently 
spun cobacco and minds wandered out from 
the walls of the warehouse into elastic worlds 
defined by stories. 

It is in this city of cockfights and shaded 
parks, where the clouds look as though they 
many 
newly-emigrated 
from Cuba, would sit 
roll 
to 
the 
rhythm 
of 
Shakespeare's 
son-
nets, 
Cervantes's 
poetry, 
Leo 
Tolstoy's prose, as the 
words read aloud 
changed the reality in 
their hands.

have "soaked up the 
whole 
sea," 
that 
Nilo Cruz sets his 
Pulitzer-Prize win-
ning play, Anna in 
tht Tropics. 

Next 
month, this city of 
cigars will be recon-
structed in a New 
York theatre, and 
actors who are cur-
rently learning their 
roles will give breath 
to the story of a 
family whose lives 
~ere changed by a 
povel read tO them 
in a warehouse. And 
on that November 
pight, Leo Tolstoy, a 
writer long dead, a 
man who was not 
one for the stage 
and cared less for 
the city, will find 
himself in a leading 
role in Broadway. 

The cigar rollers 
in Ybor were not the 
first to hire a lector. 
Across the gulf and many years before the city 
was founded, a group of artisans in Havana 
decided to find someone to read to them 
while they worked. The artisans pooled their 
wages and hired a deep-voiced lector who 
arrived each morning with a newspaper and a 
book in hand. He sar on a platform in the 
middle of the room and read in his booming 
voice. The workers were pleased, and the tra-
dition of the lector stayed alive with those 
who left to work in what was then the cigar 
capital of the world. On a summer day before 
the depression, strolling down the brick 
streets of Ybor, you might have overheard a 
lector from Cuba reading aloud from a 
Spanish newspaper in the morning and the
26 
(ln his complex and captivating play, 
·J. Cruz, who teaches playwriting at the Yale 
School of Drama and, in April of this 
year, became the first Latino co receive a 
Pulitzer Prize, explores the ways in which lit-
erature can become a provacatrice, affecting 
not only the way one perceives the world, but 
also the decisions one makes in the most inti-
mate of settings. Cruz relays the sobering and 
sometimes magical turn of events that result 
after Ofelia, a middle-aged woman with a 
pragmatic streak and a penchant for stories, 
hires 38-year-old lector Juan Julian to read to 
the workers in the cigar factory owned by her 
gambler husband, Santiago. Juan Julian has 
chosen as his first book, Tolsroy's novel of 
lust, 
betrayal, 
forgiveness, 
Anna 
Karmina. The novel quickly becomes both a 
window through which the cigar rollers can 
escape the grueling monotony of factory life, 
and more importantly, a mirror in which they 
can glimpse reflected truths about themselves. 

Marela, Ofelia's twenty-two year old daugh-
ter, a dreamer and a romantic, becomes 
enchanted with the images of Anna waltzing 
in St. Petersburg's ballrooms, while her older 
married sister, Conchira, lives out Anna's 
affair on a factory table, and her parents 
relearn what it means to forgive. 

The beauty of the play's dialogue, which 
some critics have called "stage poetry," is 
undeniable. As Marela tells Conchita, 
"Everything in life dreams. A bicycle dreams 
of becoming a boy, an umbrella dreams of 
becoming the rain, a pear dreams of becom-
ing a woman, and a chair dreams of becom-
ing a gazelle back to the forest." It is in part 
this dreamy playfulness of language that con-
vinced judges who had never seen a staged 
performance of the text to award the play a 
Pulitzer. 

When Anna in tht Tropics makes its 
Broadway debut, the task will fall to actors 
who have been carefully cast to bring this 
well-crafted stage poetry to life. And yet the 
one figure upon whom much of the story 
depends, Tolstoy himself. will have under-
gone no formal audition process. Tolstoy 
makes eight appearances in the play, in the 
form of the excerpts from his novel that are 
spoken by other characters. Cruz, who has 
noted that if his play had a main character it 
would be Tolstoy's novel, said that he chose 
Anna Karmina in part because it Is a love 
srory. And a Russian love story at that, which 
would have been of immense appeal to many 
socialist cigar-workers in the 1920s. 

The reader might wonder: If another 
master writer of romances or one of socialist 
leanings had been chosen for ~e part, say 
Emily Bronte or Fyodor Dosteovesky, would 
the play have so successfully portrayed the 
power of literature to effect change? Indeed, 
as Juan Julian tells the audience. "I could pick

another book. I've brought many." A com-
parison ofTolstoy's world view as expressed 
in Anna Karmina, and embodied in Anna in 
th~ Tropics, suggests that if the criterion is the-
matic compatibility, Tolstoy uniquely fits the 
bill. 

For a start, Tolstoy's world view is con-
sistent with some of the play's most impor-
tant ideas. One can imagine, by comparing 
these overlapping themes, that Cruz and 
Tolstoy would have had much to chat about. 
Tolstoy, like Cruz, was interested in the 
potential that art has to offer us a glimpse of 
something beyond ourselves. Throughout 
Anna Karmina, Tolstoy frames reading, as 
well as other art forms, as an act that can 
inspire transcendence. For example, in a 
scene from Anna Karmina that is excerpted 
in the play, Anna reads on a train shuttling 
through snowy Russia. The experience 
invokes a desire to act like the characters, to 
escape the present reality: 

Anna Arkadyevna read and under-
stood, but it was unpleasant for her to 
read, that is, to follow the reflection 
of other people's lives. She wanted too 
much to live herself. When she read 
about the heroine of the novel taking 
care of a sick man, she wanted to walk 
with inaudible steps round the sick 
man's room; when she read about a 
Member of Parliament making a 
speech, she wanted to make that 
speech; when she read about how 
Lady Mary rode to hounds, teasing 
her sister-in-law and surprising every-
one with her courage, she wanted to 
do it herself. But there was nothing to 
do, and so, fingering the smooth 
knife with her small hands, she forced 
herself to read. 

('l A irroring 
these 
words, 
Cruz 
J, V L describes the young Mariela's 
response to hearing Anna Karenina 
being read aloud: 

Ocroa£R 2003

Communications §rouy, 2003) J'J'·112 
I let myself be taken. When Juan 
Julian statts reading, the story enters 
my body and I become the second 
skin of the characters. 

Yet despite this reflection on literature, 
the idea of a text as a means of communicat-
ing ideas troubled Tolstoy. For every scene in 
his novel in which art offers Anna a glimpse 
of something greater than herself-a land-
scape that inspires awe, a book that inspires 
her to chase hounds-there is a scene to 
counter it. Tolstoy believed that the act of 
reading is an imperfect means of communica-
tion. First, the reality of the present cannot be 
escaped by merely picking up a good book. 
When Anna reads on the train, she is unable 
to escape a burning sense of shame, even as 
the heroine in the book in her hands 
approaches happiness. Secondly, as at least 
one eminent scholar has pointed out, Tolstoy 
emphasizes that a single text can give rise to a 
multitude of interpretations. In this way, the 
author's message cah be convoluted. A lover's 
note is misunderstood by the wife of the adul-
terous husband who fmds it, while a book 
that a socialist spends a lifetime creating is 
lost on all who read it. 

In both these respects, insofar as is evi-
dent in Anna in the Tropics, Cruz seems to 
agree with Tolstoy. Just as Anna cannot escape 
from her shame, the cigar workers cannot 
escape the material world of factory life. As 
Ofelia warns her daughter Mariela: "But my 
child, people like us ... We have to remember 
to keep our feet on the ground and stay living 
inside our shoes and not have lofty illusions." 
And just as none of Tolstoyls characters are 
able to understand books and plays and 
paintings in the same way, so too are his fel-
low-stage characters in Anna in the Tropia 
stymied by the problem of interpretation. As 
Conchita tells her husband Palomo during a 
marital dispute, "I pay attention to what he 
reads. I just don't take everything to hean the 
way you do ... for some reason I never hear 
the story the same way you do." 

One might wonder, then, whether 
Tolstoy, a writer who in his time decried writ-
ing as an imperfect means of communication, 
still makes a good choice for a play about the 
power of literature to effect change. A further 
look into both texts suggests this is not as 
problematic as it seems. Both Tolstoy and 
Cruz seem to believe that the limitations of a 
text can be overcome by the non-verbal com-
munication within it. Symbols such as a 
stolen glance, a song, the touch of a hand, can 
convey meaning in places the fallible written 
word cannot. In Anna Karmina, these 
moments of understanding occur most ofren 
when characters communicate through their 
eyes. When Anna meets her lover Vronsky at 
the train station, they exchange glances and 
Vronsky is able to decipher Anna's story: "In 
that brief glance Vronsky had time to notice 
the restrained animation that played over her 
face and fluttered between her shining eyes 
and the barely noticeable smile that curved 
her red lips." Or when Stepan Arkadyich 
awakes to the memory that his wife has dis-
covered his affair, his guilt and past is under-
stood: "From their eyes, which met in the 
mirror, one could see how well they under-
stood each other." 

This type of non-verbal communication 
is embodied i~ several moments throughout 
the play, when Cruz's characters understand 
each other not through spoken means, but 
through symbols. At the end of the first act 
Conchita tells Juan Julian that she used to cut 
her hair every second day of February. For 
Conchita, her hair tells a story. Juan Julian 
asks, "And how does one read the story of 
your hair," to which Conchita responds, "The 
same way one reads a face or a book." 

Tolstoy's views on betrayal and forgive-
ness offer another reason to cast him as prin-
ciple actor in Cruz's play. Tolstoy, who 
wavered in his religious beliefs, opens his 
novel with an epitaph from Romans 12:19, SL 
Paul, in which St. Paul announces the exis-
tence of a divine law. Tolstoy, in his trunca-
tion of the phrase, implies that it is not our 
place to enact judgment or take revenge upon 
those who have harmed us, for God says: 
"Vengeance is mine. I will repay."
