Jolly Green Giant 
THERE IS A SCENE IN Groundhog Day in whlch 
Phil Conors (played by Bill Murray) sits like 
a king in a Punxsutawney diner, chewing hls 
way through an array of the town's most deli-
ciously fatty offerings. In this small town 
haunt, an everyman can seem like an emper-
or-and that's just what Murray is. 

Customers stare curiously at this plain-look-
ing man over their apple pies and cheeseburg-
ers. "I don't know how to thank you," a 
young man says, "You saved my life." A sec-
ond later a woman cannot help but hug him 
and cry, "You saved my marriage!" 

The only newcomer to the diner looks 
on, and finally blurts our, "How is it that all 
these people know you?" 

Sitting in Willoughby's with Jake 
Weinstein, I feel like that newcomer. Like 
Phil Conor's fellow diners, everyone in this 
Chapel Street coffee shop seems to know 
Weinstein. A regular guy who prefers organic 
herbal Raspberry tea to Conor's selection of 
artery-clogging indulgences, Weinstein has a 
similar local celebrity and a good grasp on 
life. 

A bespectacled man with a bicycle in tow 
is one of the many customers who recognizes 
Weinstein. Though he falls short of crediting 
Jake for saving his marriage, he can't help 
extol Weinstein's virrues: "Jake's the greatest. 
He's very devoted to everything he does. He 
is very simply a remarkable human being." 

And, not to mention, a clown. You may 
have seen him floating above the Chapel 
Street crowd on his nine-foot stilts, and if so, 
you may even count yourself among his 
legion of followers: The students who gleeful-
ly recognize him on sidewalks, the children 
who worship him each Saturday, or the busi-
nessmen who love to engage him in debate on 
local politics. "I have some regulars," 
Weinstein concedes humbly. "A few people 
make a point of coming out every Saturday. 
There are even some 
homeless 
people 
who really enjoy it." 

Admitting even 
this much is a 
con cession 
for 
Weinstein, who is 
modest about every-
thing. Stop and chat 
with him and he 
probably won't men-
tion that he's a regis-
tered nurse, a politi-
cal activist, a teacher 
of "circus artS," and 
the founder of New 
Haven's first recy-
cling program. But 
despite his impres-
sive resume, he is 
still best known for 
his street perfor-
mances. 

He's 
been 
working Chapel Street for over 
ten years, and though he admits 
he got into it for the money, it has 
evolved into something more. 
"I'm really passionate about street 
performing." he explains. "Ideally 
I'd like to be able to use laughter to bring out 
injustices in the world. I don't believe by any 
means that everything in clowning needs to 
be political, but we can use laughter as a tool 
for healing." 

Weinstein is one of New Haven's most 
eccentric, and most overlooked, minor 
celebrities, a kind of local saint spreading joy 
wherever he goes. For the past two years, Jake 
has toured the city as a clown, visiting chil-
dren's hospitals and performing for young 
patients. As the Circus Director for Roger's 
Barn Community Circus, he has ample 
knowledge of subjectS ranging from puppet 
set construc-
tion. Earlier this 
year, he worked with 
students from two New 
Haven schools constructing enor-
mous puppets that were later fes-
tooned with protest banners and re~ 
used by the Yale strikers. Weinstein 
also teaches downing and street per-
formance, and he spends his sum-
mers as the set designer for the 
Children's Circus of Middletown. 

And, of course, he's a family man 
with a daughter at Boston University 
and a son who bikes with rum all over 
town. 

This month, Weinstein is plan-
ning to travel down the east coast 
with half a dozen "Puppetistas", or 
political puppeteers. They will per-
form at various stops on the road to 
Georgia, where they will join thou-
sands of protestors outside the 
School of the Americas. Their show 
is called "Uncle Sam's Little Global 
Circus." Weinstein explains it as a 
satire of globalization: "Uncle Sam 
has a map of the world and he tears 
off one continent at a time and eats 
it. The play concerns how he deals 
with his indigestion." 

But Weinstein bas not always been a 
down. He started out as a nurse delivering 
babies, but quit to found New Haven's first 
recycling service, a non-profit called Rainbow 
Recycling. "At its zenith," Weinstein recalls 
with a chuckle, Ratnbow Recycling was 
"seven hippies and a truek-" In addition to 
recycling. the group visited local schools reg-
ularly and led workshops on environmental 
issues. But Weinstein's interest in education 
took the program a step funher. "We had a 
upe called 'Songs for the Compost Pile' 
which really grew, and that's actually how I 
got started in theater," he says. "We started 
making puppets for the shows and downing 
and I loved it." 

So he started performing on the side, 
picking Chapel Street because of its broad 
sidewalks and wealthy patrons. "It has its ups 
and downs," he admits. "The worst that hap-
pens is some people might be intoxicated and 
they start dancing and singing and perform-
ing with you, but that's the life of a street per-
former." 

Sirting in a friendly coffee shop, 
Weinstein may be recognized as the local 
renaissance man, but to the random passerby 
be is simply a man on the street, embarrassing 
himself as a glorified panhandler. "People on 
the street get upset about clowns sometimes," 
be confesses. "They'll mutter under their 
brath as they walk by and shake their heads. 
But. you know, they think we're people who 
can't do anything else, because a street per-
former is not an elevated station in life--
whkh is ironic because, of course, I'm on 
stilts ...
