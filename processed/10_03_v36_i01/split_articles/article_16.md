This press blitz, though, may have 
helped pave the way for change. By the time 
the srrike was resolved two weeks later, nego-
tiations had yielded a surprising benefit: The 
creation of a new community training com-
mission whose aim, according to one union 
organizer, is "desegregating the workforce." 
Irs members would be drawn in equal parts 
from the unions, the University, and the com-
munity. Then, last Friday, the University 
passed yet another historic landmark, orga-
was discouraged by the complexity of the hir-
ing process. Besides, with so few Hispanic 
workers on board already, the possibility of 
working at Yale seemed remote. Now, he says, 
recalling the three or four percent figure that 
helped convince him ro support the unions, 
"I'll be happy if we see that number go up--
if we get 10 or 15 percent. I don't know what 
the ten of us will do to that [number] but 
we'll see." 

Two of the h~/gistas, Pablo Sato and 
Anibal Garcia, were actually fired by their 
Yale supervisor before they decided to join 
staked out the sub-contractors while they 
waited for their bus home from High Street 
Gate. He tried to convince the skeptical 
workers that the generous wages they were 
receiving wouldn't last long, and that the 
University was using them as pawns in its 
twisted race game. The workers kept their dis-
tance. When the bus pulled up, they boarded 
quickly and asked Smokier not to follow 
them. 

nizing a meeting with a com-
bined group of 26 representa-
tives from over half a dozen 
social services agencies in the 
Hispanic 
community. 

The 
group discussed the mechanics 
of University hiring and what 
prospective workers could do to 
better their chances of landing a 
job. 

While the press may have 
gorren things rolling, Smokier 
But the next day the union organizers 
changed tactics. Instead of waiting for the 
workers' bus ro arrive at Yale, they drove to a 
West Haven parking lor 
where rhcy attempted to 
board the bus. Sanitation

workers why they should 
support the people in the 
unions ... Why should the 
people working inside care?" 
managers responded by call-
ing the police. Refusing to 
be deterred, Smokier and 
Francesci tailed the bus in 
their cars and followed it to 
an abandoned lot in Fair 
Haven. T hey looked on as 
workers were transferred 
into unmarked Yale vans 
and others believe it was the ln«lgistas who 
were responsible for these latest triumphs. As 
part of the union's attempt to encourage 
workers co walk off the job, they promised-
by way of Smokier and the other activists who 
made contact with individual temp work-
ers-co help the ln«/gistas secure permanent 
positions when the strike ended. If successfUl, 
it would be an unprecedented breaking of the 
barriers, said union organizer Mark Wilson, 
the man responsible for fielding phone calls 
from the hu~/gistas and for finding them work 
as casuals. "In the past, H ispanic workers 
have always come in one or two at a time 
every five or ten years. So we're on the brink 
of something very important here: We have 
between seven and thirteen workers who are 
all going to start," said Wilson. "To be part of 
Yale opening its doors co more Latino and 
Hispanic workers is an awesome thing. And 
we'll look back years from now and remember 
this as a historic event." 

Jorge Rivera, one of the group's ringlead-
ers, along with Gilberto Cintrone, always 
thought the walk-ours had broader signifi-
cance. He walked out, he recalled later, "For 
all the Latinos who've been passed over, 
who've been stepped on." He had considered 
applying to work at Yale several years ago, but 


the strike. According to Sato and Garcia, their 
supervisor approached them during a break 
and let loose a barrage of personal and racial 
insults before firing them on the spot. The 
incident left them little reason not to come 
on board with Rivera and Cintrone. 

Yet weeks later, the memory of the man-
ager's racist slurs still stung. "You can tell in 
the way they treat you," he said, sitting in the 
living room of his first-floor apartment in the 
Hill neighborhood. "They're one way with 
gringos, then with Spanish people they 
change." Anibal's experience during his rwo 
years in New Haven has had a similarly dis-
couraging effect. If things don't pan out with 
work at Yale in the next month, he is consid-
ering returning to Puerto Rico. 

For the sub-contractors assigned else-
where, though, the decisiof! to strike carne 
less easily. The first day that Smokier and a 
well-known union activist in the Hispanic 
community, Norma Francesci as well as sever-
al Hispanic clergy met the arriving workers at 
the High Street Gate, a few of the furure ln«/-
gistas were more annoyed than inspired. 

Happy to have been chosen for one of 
Sanitation Management's 60 jobs from an 
applicant pool of over 180, they preferred to 
be left alone. That afternoon, Smokier again 
which would carry them past strikers and 
safely to the campus. 

When the workers finally arrived that 
morning, they were more than an hour late. 
Later that day, taking a break from work in 
Davenport, Angie Aponte, Luis Loyola, and 
Martha Rames enjoyed a good laugh at the 
organizers' expense. Who did they think they 
were, interfering with people who were just 
trying to make a living? 


But what really bothered the three of 
them was the N~w Havm &gistn- arti-
cle describing the union leaders' press 
conference the day before, at which union 
representatives had denounced the University 
for playing the race card. 

Loyola, who at 24 is more than five years 
older than both Ramos and Aponte, was 
indignant: "See why arc they making this a 
race thing? That offends me." 

Ramos seized on the quote from one of 
the pastors who said that the workers were 
acting "by ignorance." 

"Are they saying we're ignorant?" she 
asked indignandy. "We're not the ones chas-
ing the union people in our cars. Who's the 
ignorant one?" Aponte and Loyola laughed in 
agreement. 


But less than two days later, all three of the former Davenport cus-
todial workers were on the Green, accepting hugs and congratulations 
from union members and activists who said their decision not to go to 
work that day had been a watershed in race relations at Yale. Aponte 
and Ramos had both brought their babies, and in the warmth of a 
sunny Friday morning. their news created an especially celebratory 
atmosphere: Black union members took up chants of solidarity in 
Spanish, and everyone professed their firm intention never to be divid-
ed by race again. 

When the television cameras began rolling. Aponte took the 
microphone and spoke on behalf of the huelgistas. They were tired of 
being abused as Yale's pawns, she said: "We want to be treated like other 
people." 

The next week, afrer the press con-
ference, some of the once reluctant hu~l­
gistas even helped try to convince other 
Sanitation workers to walk out. Most 
were too afraid to talk to them, but the 
huelgistas knew flfSthand that even the 
most seemingly deaf ears can be open to 
new ideas. 

As Rivera recalled afrer the strike: 
"When people talk, you listen. At the 
beginning they said they were going to 
get us this and it sounded sketchy. You 
don't want to jump into something you 
don't know." For him, the leap of faith 
had been largely personal. ''I've known 
Norma {Francesci] from around the 
neighborhood for a long time; she was-
n't going to try to play us around." 

Los mormos is a term used among the characteristically blunt 
Hispanic community to refer to union members. It means, more or 
less, the "black people." For Alberto Mendieta, another huelgista, the 
significance of the union's racial compostion is unavoidable. "There are 
black and white people on the inside," he explained with a shrug. "and 
they want to help bring in their people."

f course, neither of Yale's unions is entirely devoid of Hispanics. 
Hispanic members of Local 35 have been doing their job more 
or less unconcerned by the race issue for years. The obstacles to 
Hispanic employment, rather, seem to crop up earlier in the process. 
According to Ramirez, Yale is too stringent about demanding English-
language fluency and verifying the authenticity of immigtation papers, 
two tendencies that bespeak more racial bias than 
they do quality control. "Why do they do that?" he 
asked quizzically. "You don't need to speak English 
to sweep." 

In fact, the employment test required for appli-
cants seeking a position in Yale's custodial or dining 
hall workforce requires only a basic level of English 
profeciency. Although it features mainly basic arith-
metic questions, its instructions are in English. A 
score of 70 percent is required to pass. Mike 
Morand, Associate Vice President ofYale's Office of 
New Haven and State AffiUrs, points out that the 
University's minimum threshold of language compe-
tency is no higher than that held by the city or most 
other universities and companies across the nation. 
It is certainly higher, however, than the StAtnda.rds 
held by Sanitation Management, Inc., among whose 
Yale-based workers were dozens who spoke no 
English at all. Hispanic workers already in the door 
at Yale offer a mixed assessment of their employers' 
track record on race. Though he has never felt tar-
geted by racial prejudice, Dolores Cadilla, a Puerto 
Rican immigrant who has been working at Yale since 
1958, knows many from the Hispanic community 
who have sought work at Yale but to whom, he says,

Yale has not had the courtesy to respond. Ca.dilla 
But the unions' low number of 
Hispanic members meant that there 
weren't many neighborhood people 
huelgistas could turn to for advice con-
cerning the walkout. Instead, the hu~l­
gistas made new friends with other 
union members on the picket line. 

Ramos and Aponte continued to bring 
their kids most mornings, and everyone

in the basement of First and Summerfield Church. 

Afrer the walkout, union organizers kept an eye on the group, 
meeting with them each morning beneath the strike tent or outside the 
union office on Chapel Street. They repeated their promise that when 
the strike was over, the huelgistas would be well positioned to get per-
manent jobs at Yale. Nery Ramirez, an immigrant from Guatemala and 
a Boston-based organizer understood the difficulty in getting Hispanic 
workers to leave a well-paying job in support of predominandy black 
union members: •It's not obvious to the workers why they should sup-
port the people in the unions. Wal.king out would help los 71UJ1'mOS get 
a contract faster but why should the people working inside care?• 


Another Puerto Rican member of Local 35 who has 
worked at Yale since 1964 agrees. He estimates that he knows ZOO pec>-
ple in the Hispanic community who would love to work at Yale, but 
who either don't know how to apply, or when they do drop off an appli-
cation at the Human Resources (HR) office, hit a stone wall. They are 
simply never called back. 

L
ast week's ~storic meeting between_ Yale ~d His. panic ~resenta­
tives was mtended to address precisely this lack of clarity about 
Yale's hiring practices. University officials say that opening com-
munication channels and improving job access for Hispanics has been 
a goal since long before this fall's strike. The biggest hindrance to bring-
ing in more Hispanic workers, Morand explained, is simply the lack of 
job turnove.r in Yale's unions. The average tenure of a Local 35 worker, 
for instance, is about 15 years, and the union only has 1100-odd mem-
bers. 

According to Smokler, though, combined job openings for Locals 
34 and 35 are still around 800 per year. But like all jobs at Yale, these 
positions are in high demand. The University's Human Resources 
Office estimates that it receives 100 resumes per day for positions across 
the university. Morand adds that in the past when the HR office has 
done "open resting" for union positions, the line could have stretched 
past his offic~almost a half-mile from HR. Instead, the horde of over 
1,000 applicants snaked around the HR building. 

The discrepancy between worker supply and university demand 
makes securing a job here difficult for anyone--white, black, or 
Hispanic. And according to the 2000 census, although Hispanics make 
up a quarter of the city, they are only 13 percent of its high school grad-
uates. Bur, as Morand points our, that hasn't stopped rhe staff at 
Human Resources from doing the same presentations on Yale employ-
ment opportunities in Fair Haven as it does at public libraries around 
the city. 

Recently, members of the Hispanic community have noticed a 
spike in the number of Spanish-language advertisements routing Yale'y 
commitment to diversity and bumas relaciones with the Hispanic com; 
munity. One full-page ad that appeared on page two of La \.0z Hispana 
last week read, "Yale University is dedicated to having diversity in its 
employee community and to looking for qualified candidates from the 
community for regular employment." The advertisement, though, did 
not specify whether Yale was currently hiring and only referred readers 
to HR's website for more information. On an afrernoon last week, when 
La \.0z was distributed free of charge in a Fair Haven deli, none of the 
customers thought the ad was sufficient. 

Deli owner and activist Francesci put the question to several of her 
customers from behind the counter of her Main Street shop: "Have you 
ever seen an advertisement in a Spanish-language newspaper or any-
where dse for hiring at Yale?" The chorus of responses was in agree-
ment~ Not one. On her own, Francesci has assured her friends among 
the huelgistas that they will be taken care of and placed as casuals with-
in the next few weeks, the first step to procuring a union job perma-
nently. But then again, she sees little in the history of interaction 
between Yale and the Hispanic community to give her complete confi-
dence. The huelgistaswill have ro wait and see. 

A
fter the dishes were cleared at the Grand Avenue parry, Cintrone 
announced that he wasn't going to do his waiting quietly. The 
day before, the group had received the home phone number of 
Local 35 manager Mark Sullivan with instructions to call him on 
Monday about job placement. By Saturday afternoon, though, 
Cintrone had already called Sullivan once, and he knew what time on 
Monday be was going to call again. He told the others to do the same. 
·rm calling that guy everyday. I'll call him a hundred times a day 
if I have to, everyday for a month, until pretty soon he's going to get 
sick of me calling and be's going to give me a job," he said confidently. 

Seated on the patio outside with a cigarette in his hand, Aponte said 
OcroeER 2003 
that was her plan as well. She promised to pass along whatever infor-
mation she got co Loyola and the others who didn't speak English . 

Though Mark seemed eager to help, he does not know Spanish. 

I 
f Rivera's dream of a stronger Hispanic workforce at Yale pans out, 
rhe lack of Spanish-speakers in union management shouldn't last 
long. As it is, when Loyola stopped by the office one day last week to 
speak with Sullivan about the status of the h~lgi.stas' forthcoming 
employment, Smokler had to translate. Still, his advice to Loyola was 
promising: Give it another two to three weeks, Sullivan said, and you 
should all be taken care of. 

In the meantime, the huelgi.stas have become a tight-knit bunch, 
often congregating at one another's homes or meeting ar the union 
office to check in with Sullivan. Rivera is eager to throw another get-
together like the one che day after the strike ended, when his wife 
cooked past~ks. But for now his plans are on hold, as the couple awaits 
the birth of their second child, a girl due in mid-Oetober. Besides, the 
real cause to celebrate will only come once the whole group has steady 
jobs at Yale, and then again when they have accumulated 380 hours and 
can graduate from casual status ro full-fledged union membership, with 
benefits and a fixed schedule. 

Smokier is confident they will receive a warm reception. Members 
of both Locals 34 and 35, he says, understand their struggle wich Yale: 
"They know that if rhey don't grow and expand they can't win." 

For Yale's parr, the necessity to welcome Hispanic workers into the 
fold certainly appears ro have become more pressing. But according to 
Morand, the only change of late is that the University has more time 
for city outreach now that months of tense labor negotiations are at last 
ar an end. Bur fundamentally, he says, che University has nor changed 
its course. 

Not surprisingly, the reading from the union office is a bit differ-
em. Wilson, rhe hu~lgistas' point person, sees the University's new 
acceptance of diversity as a capitulation: "The cry for assistance from 
the Hispanic community has finally gotten loud enough char Yale has 
to listen." 

To the huelgistas, though, the motive for change hardly matters. 
Standing outside the union office after a meeting with Sullivan two 
weeks after che strike, Aponte, Velazquez and Rivera conferred. 
"He says a couple weeks," Rivera reported. 

Aponte replied with a touch of regret, "But we won't all be togetb-
er. .. 

"I don't care; I told him any shift, anytime, graveyard, whatever," 
said Rivera. "Even part-time. Any job here and I'll be set." Many of his 
frieAds in Fair Haven are sure to agree.
