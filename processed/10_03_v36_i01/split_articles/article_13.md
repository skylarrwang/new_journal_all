EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The Space sits in an industrial park on 
the border of Hamden and New Haven. It 
shares the asphalt and concrete terrain with 
five inner city churches and a handful of 
shops. In its previous life, The Space was the 
sixth church in this no man's land. A week 
before the 
church 
closed, Steve Rodgers 
was evicted from the 
warehouse where he 
had 
lived 
and 
entertained, hosting 
underground 
(and 
illegal) open mics for 
nine years. The tim-
ing was serendipitous. 
He signed the lease 
for 
what 
would 
become The Space 
just days after he lost 
his home. 
The Space 
is a 
place for music 
lovers of 
the 
purest kind. 
Even 
so, the acts run 
the gamut from 
dud to "duuuude!"


From the outside, The Space doesn't look 
like a church, a club, or much of anything for that matter. But a peek inside reveals 
an explosion of idiosyncratic life. The venue 
is in a basement, and every inch is covered. 
Baby carriages, a miniature Winnebago, 
Christmas lights, old records, a mannequin, 
and a beauty salon chair crowd every nook. 
There is something happening at The 
Space nearly every day. But the venue is perhaps most legendary for its Tuesday night 
open mic. The shows start at 8:00 sharp and 
every performer gets just two songs. Before 
each session, Steve reminds everyone that this 
is a "listening space" and that there is no talking during performances. Although Steve 
goes out of his way to nurture local musicians, there is an 
unspoken rule 
that open mic-
ers should play 
original music. 
Covers 
are 
frowned upon. 
This, combined 
with the class-
room 
feel, 
makes 
The 
Space a place for 
music lovers of 
the purest kind. 
so, the acts 
run the gamut from dud to "duuudef" 
Ron Anthony, for one, can bring a crowd 
to tears. "Country blues or a pretty rune?" he 
asks. The audience calls for blues and so he 
plays, crooning from behind a thick grey 
mustache and oversized glasses. He starts to 
pick a simple blues progression. After a few 
bars, his Southern-edged, steady voice fills the 
room and nobody moves a muscle. You can't 
download Anthony's music on the internet 
and he's never cut a record. The only place 
you can count on him playing from one week 
to the next is in the basement of this squat 
building on a little road off of Dixwell 
Avenue on edge of New Haven. 
Obviously not every act is as sweet as 
Ron Anthony. Casper, Big Dog, and 
D-Money, for example, couldn't be more different. "Give these s.1ys a hand," Steve tells 
the crowd as he motions the band of 12-year-
olds up to the stage. Casper's dad had 
dropped them off and was probably still waiting in the parking lot. "Yo, yo ya yo, check it, 
yo ya yo yo, yo," makes up the bulk of the rap 
but there are also several near-rhymes about 
Big Dog's braces and about how Casper is 
going to get stuffed in a trash can. When they 
finish, Steve thanks them and asks for two 
more rounds of applause. One 45-year-old 
guy gives a standing ovation. This is not special treatment, though-he awards every act 
this respect. 


When the middle schoolers stomp off 
the stage, a middle-aged woman with messy 
blond hair scoots on. "Who would I be? 
What would I do? If you wanted me too?" As 
she sings, she crinkles her face in a way any 
agent would be quick to correct if her objective were fame. "I think with local music 
there is an obvious struggle to it," Steve said 
later. "There is a young guy or girl or group 
that wakes up everyday and goes to a crappy, 
crappy job, or wakes up and goes to classes 
that they couldn't care less about and the 
thing that's pushing them in life is music." As 
the blond woman walks off, catharsis complete, the crowd cheers. Afterwards, the audience members congratulate her by name and 
ask where she has been for the last few weeks. 
Steve Rodger's community is small enough 
that people are missed when they don't show 
up.


**BAR**
**Page number(s): 11**

BAR is much more hip and self-aware. 
Here, designer jeans are paired with low 
top Converse All-Stars in traditional black. 
The drink of choice is a glass of red wine or 
pale ale, depending on the show. Sunday 
night shows at BAR are advertised as starting 
at 9:00, but most begin at least an hour late. 
This tardiness is not an oversight; these shows 
are financed by bar proceeds, so Rick likes to 
give people time to drink. This system allows 
Rick to roll over profits from show to show, 
and gives him more flexibility in choosing 
what to book. If he books a profitable show, 
next week's show can be more experimental, 
and the bar can take a hit if the cut from pre-
show drinking is not enough to cover the 
band's costs. Standard fare is a couple hundred bucks per show. 


At BAR, like at The Space, musicianship 
is taken seriously. "I book four shows a 
month- I want every one to count. I want 
people to have their ass kicked, their lives 
changed." Ass kicking, however, doesn't necessarily translate into dancing. During one of 
BAR's concerts, the lead singer of Soviet, the 
main act for that night, remarked, "All across 
the country, this is the only place we've played 
where not a single person was dancing," at 
which point he rushed the floor and spun 
around in circles while stomping his feet up 
and down and clapping enthusiastically. The 
crowd just watched from their seats. 


During concerts Rick perches on a platform that looks like a tree house, hardly visible as he adjusts knobs and presses buttons. 
He is the sound guy and he likes it loud. As 
the synth pop of Soviet crescendoed and 
everyone in the room bounced in place, you 
could forget you were one of only 60 people 
in a room designed for dance parties in a 
pizza place in New Haven. You could feel like 
you were at a show. 


For many in the New Haven community, Connecticut is, as Rick puts it, "the gas 
station between New York and Boston." And 
although this reputation may not sound like 
much, promoters can use it to their advantage. Sometimes Rick can even get national 
touring acts to play at BAR on Sunday nights, 
because it's an off night when bands are on 
the road between gigs. Until New Haven creates its own identity for itself, it must be satisfied to feed off the vibrancy of New York 
and Boston. 


But then, an identity is precisely what 
Rick is trying to create: "New Haven will 
never be New York part two and I wouldn't 
want it to be. There are a million reasons why 
New Haven is slammin' and it just has to step 
it up. You look at how many things are going 
on in New York. Boston's got it. Providence 
has got it. And I've played those rooms. 
They're not all real fancy." 


The question remains, though, why 
choose to take on this battle in New Haven? 
"Because I know this town is amazing," says 
Rick. "I've traveled to all but five states in the 
United States numerous times. Florida, 
California, Texas, New Mexico. New Haven 
rocks!" 


Most national bands, not surprisingly, 
don't think of New Haven as a rocking 
town, making it incredibly difficult, if not 
downright impossible, to get them to come 
here. Rick knows this better than anyone. In 
his quest to make New Haven a musical 
hotbed, he has been repeatedly shot down. 
Getting bands to come to New Haven is hard 
enough, but getting them to come to 
BAR--one of the city's lesser known music 
venues-is particularly challenging. Most 
recently, Kristin Hersh and Alice Donut 
declined to play a show there. "A lot of it is 
just having the reputation," says Rick. "I have 
nothing right now." He relays a dialogue that 
by now is all too familiar-'"Where, what is 
it called again?' 'BAR' 'Okay, but what's the 
name of the place?' 'BAR."' Rick shakes his 
head. "I just have to remember to keep myself 
grounded."


**BAR Continued**
**Page number(s): 12**

The ways Rick could move BAR up the 
musical ladder are pretty straightforward. 
Booking an artist with a high profile record 
label is currency in this business. The more 
high profile labels that are represented at a 
venue, the easier it is to convince an agent 
that his band should play there too. Working 
with an agent from one firm gives a promoter an in with a different agent from the same 
firm. Agents, record labels, and name recognition are the medals of honor. "You know 
like the Kristin Hersh, Alice Donut thing was 
super 
over ambitious," 
Rick admits. 
"Especially Kristin Hersh-getting into it I 
knew her agent was going to say no. He said 
probably not and I pushed him. He said no 
and I asked him to compromise and tell me 
why. He told me why and I'm still pushing. 
Even my last email to him was like I know 
you can't do it, but let me know if something 
changes and please consider me next time 
around." 


As if his dream of putting New Haven 
on the map doesn't face enough obstacles, 
even locals are skeptical. "'Nothing ever happens in New Haven,"' Rick whines in imitation. "Students show up--'Nothing is going 
on in New Haven, I can't wait to go back 
home.' It's like you know what? This is my 
response to everybody who has that to say," 
he said dragging out the 'everybody.'"Fuck It. 
That's my response. Anybody who said there's 
nobody good playing rock, anybody who said 
there is nothing for me--that's bullshit. I'm 
positive I will have one of every kind of band 
play in that room at some point."
