ON NoVEMBER 8, THE YALÂ£- AFFtLIATED com-
muniry service organization Present Fathers 
plans to take a trip to the Bridgeport Zoo--
but not just to admire the aardvarks or wave 
to the walruses. Present Fathers is an offshoot 
of the Male Involvement Nerwork (MIN), a 
New Haven-based initiative which operates a 
social service nerwork for fathers in New 
Haven. MIN's mission is to reconnect divorced 
fathers with their estranged children and to 
improve family life by providing dads with 
healthier life options. A trip to the zoo may 
not erase the pain of growing up without a 
father, or help a lonely man who cannot 
support himself, but it may be enough 
to start building a f.unily. At least, that 
is what Germano Kimbro is hop-
ing for. 

Kimbro, born and bred in 
New Haven, embraces the chal-
lenge of providing help for fami-
lies in MIN, and in the present 
economic slump, with high 
demand for social services and 
little money, it is quite a chal-
lenge. As project coordinator of 
MJN, Kimbro is fully responsible for expand-
ing MIN's influence and taking the program in 
new directions. Perhaps his impact is best evi-
denced in the less than idealistic approach 
MIN has taken to irs services. The program 
does not promise a social soma to eliminate 
poverry, but aims to encourage fathers to set 
an example for their families through healthy 
decision-making. MIN's goal is not to aug-
ment a pauilineal hierarchy by reestablishing 
the man as the leader of the family; instead, 
MIN's aim is to enable men to define their 
roles in relation to women and children and 
to recognize that what they can give, whether 
it be money or just their free time, can help 
their kids. "We are interested in strengthen-
ing the family through father involvement by 
connecting them to housing, education, 
employment and health opportunities," Mr. 
Kimbro explained. 

The program takes a holistic approach to 
emphasizing physical well-being and emo-
tional stabiliry. The project coordinators and 
staff urge men co make an "emotional com-
mitment" to their program, which is intend-
ed to be an "aggressive outreach before the 
point of crisis." The center provides an eight 
week seminar class covering topics 
like nutrition, pre-natal care, and 
the responsibiliry of a father to his 
children. MIN builds a safery net 
so that participantS in the pro-
gram do not revert back to old 
habits. Kimbro stressed the 
need to stop perpetuating the 
cycle of abandonment by not 
exposing children to the same 
risks - their parents were 
exposed co. He urges the 
men in the program to real-
ize a connection berween 
the physical, mental, and 
spiritual forces of their 
lives--a somewhat organic 
approach to social service.
