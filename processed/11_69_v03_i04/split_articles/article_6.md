Seymour Melman may wear a three-piece suit, 
but he was fighting the Pentagon before you were . 
by George Kannar 
Frank talking and straight shooting have 
always been part of the American self-
image. All good Americans pride them-
selves in "getting down to business" and 
"caJiing a spade a spade." All that honesty 
began to wane, however, about twenty 
years ago when the United States gov-
ernment decided to abolish the War 
Department and set up the Department of 
Defense instead. Though the Department 
continued to send invading forces all over 
the world, now they were not in the name 
of agression, they were for "defense." 
And through the 1960's, the progression 
to greater and greater euphemisms has 
continued. 
Seymour Melman has suggested that the 
next logical step would be to rename the 
Department of Defense the Department of 
Deterrence. It would be much more in 
line with the Pentagon's current excuse for 
making war. 
Melman was being facetious, of course. 
But his misgivings about the American war 
machine go far deeper than the hypocrisy 
of its name. Melman, a professor of 
industrial engineering at Columbia and the 
leader of a Calhoun Collge seminar, is 
probably the original critic of the nation's 
military-industrial complex. And as the 
talk moves away from nomenclature and 
into guns and bombs, his joking tone 
becomes dead serious. 
Our very concept of defense, Melman 
believes, is actually a misnomer, for 
defense as such, be feels, no longer exists. 
In the nuclear age it cannot be purchased 
at any price, not even for an $83 billion 
annual budget. Furthermore, Melman 
says, the defense establishment is actually 
harming the chance for peace through its 
lust for organizational expansion. The 
primary way of satisfying that lust is war. 
Melman's voice is not as loud as that 
of some of the more recent outspoken 
opponents of the defense establishment, 
but he is no armchair critic either. 
Although his objections are the same as 
those of left-wing politicians and disaf-
fected students, his approach is basicalJy 
different: he is taking on the military-
industrial complex on its own terms. He 
researches his critiques fully and he 
provides concrete alternatives to present 
policies, such as his itemized plan for 
cutting $55 billion from the current 
military budget. 
Melman's suggested budget shows a 
basic element of his approach to the 
military-industrial machine. His writings 
and speeches are low on ideology but high 
on facts and figures. A fundamentalist 
old-fashioned patriotism runs through his 
critique; he opposes the military-industrial 
machine because it is betraying his vision 
of what America ought to be, because it is 
creating a totalitarian atmosphere directly 
contrary to the officially professed 
American dream. A "left conservative" 
like Norman Mailer, Melman wants the 
nation to steer itself back: to the democratic 
and humanitarian course it once struggJed 
to follow. 
The Pentagon·s technocratic infrastruc-
ture, says Melman, is ruining the United 
States not only through what he calJs its 
"Vietnam wars program" but also through 
the general economic and moral orienta-
tion it has created. The costs of this 
orientation are high, be says, and the 
benefits none. The nation spends too much 
time, talent and energy piling up useless 
military hardware at the expense of 
everything else. His work: at Columbia has 
largely centered on determining just what 
"everything else" is, and on figuring out 
how to begin getting some of it. 
"I've spent most of my time working on 
the economic determinants of technology 
and of alternative ways of doing things," 
Melman says. ''The alternative theme is an 
important one to me because you have to 
have alternatives to present when you 
argue with the status quo." 
Instead of merely stating that the status 
quo is immoral, Melman says it is stupid, 
inefficient and costly. And be proves it. 
From outward appearances there is no way 
of telling whose side Melman is on. He 
clothes his bulky frame in J. Press style 
elegance, he carries a battered briefcase, 
and his syntax is straight whiz-kid stuff, at 
least on the surface. Melman does not talk 
about setting up a due date for a term 
paper, he "determines the best means of 
achieving that objective." He sits in a 
seminar room as if be were sitting before a 
Senate subcommittee: back rigid, leaning 
slightly forward, hands folded on the table 
with his documents and position papers 
stacked neatly beside them, looking 
straight ahead with a suspiciously mani-
acal beam in his eyes. In precise but not 
inelegant language, he tears apart the mil-
itary machine from top to bottom coolly 
and unhurriedly. With his Cyrus Vance-
like granny glasses, Melman comes across 
as a slightly jowly member of the Kennedy 
set, a stocky Theodore Sorenson with his 
mouth fuJI. 
Melman fits the John Kennedy intellec-
tual style. He looks and talks like the 
original Kennedy crowd: a cool Ivy league 
professor, competent and committed, 
willing to come down from his ivory tower 
if the nation calls for his skills as an 
organizer and social manipulator. 
But Melman has nothing good to say 
about the Kennedys and what they did. 
They centralized the Pentagon machinery, 
and they brought in new techniques of 
data processing to keep track of what they 
were doing. Time after time McNamara 
and his band would appear at a press 
conference or Congressional hearing with 
charts, diagrams and tables all designed 
to prove, for example, that there really was 
light at the end of the Southeast Asian 
tunnel. Melman's approach is the same. He 
makes no statements he cannot back up 
with the appropriate statistics. Only he is 
proving that what sounds reasonable is 
true-not that what sounds cra.zy is true. He 
talks about reality, not think-tank 
scenarios. 
One of the first to realize that the whiz-
kid technocratic extravaganza was a 
put-on, Melman tried to warn the then 
Senator John Kennedy of the disastrous 
consequences of the ideas which his 
"expert" advisers were advancing so 
skillfully. Needless to say, the warning 
went unheeded. 
" I began to see what was coming with 
that Harvard-MIT axis. I was outraged. 
They thought they knew all the answers. 
It was real arrogance. They thought they 
had a monopoly on the brains, the money 
and the organization. They thought 
military power was the main way of 
solving international problems. 
"I was outraged and frightened, and I 
turned my hand to oppose them. Even if 
there were no institutions, even though 
there was no money. still I had two hands 
and a pen, so I decided to use them;• and 
his career as a professional voice of 
common sense was underway. 
One of his first targets was that part of
