New Haven's finest 
continued from page 2 
arrived. One policeman leapt towards us; 
the other was already pulling. I obliged 
their efforts. 


As we were herded into the paddy-
wagon, we asked what charges were 
pressed against us. 
"Disorderly conduct." 
"And on him," said one officer pointing 
to me, "resisting arrest and abusing." 
"Abusing? What does that mean?" 
"It means using bad language to a police 
officer." 
"We didn't." 


No profanity or insult was used, but that 
seemed of little import as the rear doors 
slammed shut in our faces. We sat speech-
less, facing each other as the truck made 
its half circuit around the Green, which, 
through the narrow wagon windows, 
took on a different demeanor. The entire 
city did. A hidden driveway leads from 
Court Street into the bowels of City Hall. 
We were driven into a garage. Its door 
closed. 


Four students arrived at the New Haven 
city jail at approximately 11 :00 PM where 
booking was made. No mention of bond or 
right to counsel was made. We were Jed to 
cells in two's after effecting belt-removal 
to prevent self-hanging. "Yale students are 
going to find out that when somebody says 
move, you move. They're going to find out 
that some New Haven cops aren't going to 
stand for the kind of stuff you kids try to 
pull." 


The first cell block was well sprinkled 
with hippies from the Green. The raid had 
been effective. Our block had mostly 
blacks from Haven and James Streets, 
from Henry and Dixwell. The jail was an 
unreflective green. And, like most jails, the 
toilets which are supposed to flush never 
do. Ours had four strata of urine in it 
representing prisoners of various pasts. 
Seven cigarette butts floated on top. The 
six by ten foot floor had a large puddle in 
it, whether from spittle, urine, or sweat it 
was bard to tell. 


I had asked for a telephone, but it was 
now apparent our hosts wanted us to stay 
the night. 


The jail keeper appeared. "What's your 
charge again?" He was a young Puerto 
Rican, socialized by the police and anxious 
to assert his fiefdom of power. 
"Disorderly conduct," I repeated. "And 
when do we get a telephone?" The keeper, 
however, obviously enjoying his position, 
proceeded to show us how the police can 
control a prisoner by simply tightening the 
handcuffs. He demonstrated on my wrist 
by closing the cuffs as hard as he could. 
"See, they can hurt if you get rough." 


Frank, the other student in the cell, was 
remarking that jail was not so bad. It was 
his first experience. "Rather pleasant in a 
way,like working in a factory for the 
summer. It. takes patience. The wheels of 
justice grind exceeding slow so policemen 
don't come out looking foolish." 


An unfamiliar police face walked by, 
which, at our insistence, produced a 
telephone. I called a lawyer, well-known 
enough to police so that he could have us 
released on our own recognizance. The 
attorney said we would be out in ten 
minutes, once be telephoned the desk 
sergeant. The desk sergeant agreed to 
this, yet two hours later we were still 
incarcerated. 


So, we took to singing songs, "Here we 
sit like birds in the wilderness ... " and 
trying to read the profuse graffiti. 
Don't laugh 
I did it 
and I came 
back here too 
many times 
Remember, don't laugh. 


The keeper returned to ask, for the second 
time, bow we liked it in jail. Our neighbor 
in the adjoining cell, a black, asked when 
be was getting out and was told "Never." 
I asked the keeper if he had been given the 
use of a phone. 
"But he don't get one." 
"He has a constitutional right to one." 
"No, he doesn't." 
"Why is that?" 
"He's mental. He tries to bang himself 
with the phone cord. He's mental 
retarded." 
''That doesn't make any difference; he's 
stiiJ guaranteed right to counsel," said I in 
my best liberal voice. ''You can watch him 
make the phone call if you're afraid of a 
suicide on your hands." 
"But I was told not to. Besides, he don't 
mind." 


We did mind and resorted to calling the 
Yale police. Two of them arrt\Â£ed within 
the half hour, apologizing for the delay: 
They had not known of our arrest. The 
proverbial Yale bail fund for students 
arrested performed its work quickly. We 
drove ho.me to Phelps Gate in the early 
morning rain. 


Two weeks later the court dropped the 
collective charge of 'disorderly conduct.' 
"These are Yale students, your honor, and 
have sanction to be at the corner of College 
and Chapel." We bad requested our lawyer 
to build his case upon our actions as 
ordinary citizens acting perfectly within 
our rights. But the prosecutor evidently 
ignored our defense, and forgot as well to 
drop the charge of resisting and abusing 
against me. 


When my lawyer and I returned to City 
Hall the following month, the arresting 
officer was sitting in the nearly empty 
courtroom. The lawyer grimaced, ''The 
prosecutor said he'd nolle it yesterday." 
The cop looked quite harmless in this 
setting. Looking carefully, I found that he 
was actually. quite uneasy. 
"All he wants is an apology, the cop. 
Apologize and you can walk out of here.'' 
My lawyer. 
"I didn't say 'fuck you'. I used no 
abusive language. How can I apologize?" 
"Look, his authority has been ques-
tioned. He wants to save face. He was 
ordered to clear the Green, got himself 
into a bind with you guys and now he 
wants a way out." 


I spoke to the policeman but did not 
apologize. He was anxious to accept 
anything I said. 


And so the judge walked in. Once 
again the prosecutor presented his case. 
Perfunctorily he explained that as a 
student at Yale, an arrest would destroy 
my career, that I was profoundly 
apologetic. The judge agreed; my attorney 
shook my hand; I left, remembering not 
to laugh.


**Letter from Cambridge**
**Author: Bill Hamilton**

Letter from Cambridge 
Exhaustion and the reality of reading 
period and final exams served to check the 
intense and agonizing self-examination 
Harvard was forced to undergo after last 
spring's bust. But anxious administrators 
and eager radicals were even then looking 
ahead to the coming academic year with 
mixed feelings <Jf apprehension and ex-
pectation. Every faction bad its own 
prediction of what was to follow; all 
agreed that the turbulence would not end. 


But after the first month of the fall 
semester, it has become apparent that 
at least for the time being an entirely 
unexpected return to normalcy bas in fact 
taken place. This is not to say that the 
issues and emotions of last April have been 
forgotten-the endless committee reports 
and the red-fist posters now sold at the 
Coop prevent that-but that the sense 
of community and concern that came out 
of the confrontation last year bas been 
scattered. 


There seems to be little sense of di-
rection on anybody's part this year. SDs-
with its endless blood-letting between 
factions -has lost its position of political 
dominance, and its meetings attract only 
a few diehards. There is no such thing 
as a moderate organization: Young Dems 
almost voted to disband, and the acrony-
mic student government organizations-
SFAC, HUC and HRPC-seem to have 
disappeared entirely. Into their places 
have stepped a number of new orga-
nizations-the Student Mobilization 
Committee, the November Action 
Committee and the Moratorium. October 
15th was certainly a success; hardly 
anyone held or attended classes, and the 
rally on the Boston Common was the 
largest in the country. But then, who isn't 
against the War, and anyway it was a 
nice day and fun to march. 


As early as the fourth day of classes the 
Administration was served a reminder of 
times past when the Weathermen dis-
rupted Henry Kissinger's old home, the 
Center for International Affairs. But 
the tactics of the disruption were so 
repugnant and the motives behind it so 
unclear, that the action was met by 
universal condemnation. It is likely that 
the CIA as well as the Cambridge Project-
a Defense Department-funded social 
sciences survey-will continue to be 
under fire. 


What activism there is focuses on the 
university's role in society and within its 
own community, and there is hardly any 
discussion about the actual quality of 
the education Harvard offers its students. 
The Fainsod Committee-set up by the 
Faculty last winter-recently released its 
report on the operation of the faculty and 
the ways students can be brought into 
the decision-making process, but unfortu-
nately it is remarkable only for its vague-
ness and statements of the obvious. 


Perhaps, as one tutor who was active 
in the strike has suggested, there is a 
cyclical pattern of activism and protest, 
and the pendulum will begin to swing 
back to where it was last spring. As the 
memories of summer begin to fade, the 
initial interest in course work begins to 
wane and it is no longer possible to 
lie in the sun on the banks of the Charles, 
there is bound to be a change in mood. 


But what person, as be surveyed the 
blood-stained Yard last April and thought 
of the coming year, could have imagined 
that the next time it would contain 
shouting students and alerted police would 
be a panty raid by several hundred fresh-
man on Radcliffe early in the semester. 
From "On strike, shut it down" to 
"Cliffies want sex" and "statutory rape" 
five months later-and somehow you know 
Warren Harding would have understood.
