In a sense, Melman says, the military industrial system is pro-
ducing in America the conditions of a backward country. 
air. He said, 'Well, why don't we get 
working on it?' I said, 'The people and the 
money just aren't there.' He said, 'Where 
are they?' I said, 'You've got them.' 
McNamara blew his stack, but he could 
not change the facts. He did have them. 
"The critical element in an industrial 
society is the supply of skilled manpower. 
The number of skilled people and the 
number of people who can be trained at 
any one time is finite. The money spent 
for military research-which makes up 
more than half of all research and 
development expenditures for everything 
in the whole country-is unavailable for 
improving the New H aven Railroad." 


Melman, who says he tries hard not to 
be paranoid, attributes this depletion to 
Sputnik, which started the space race, and 
to Robert McNamara, who converted 
the Department of Defense into a highly 
centralized and immensely powerful 
military-industrial machine. Before the 
Kennedy team took over in 1961 the 
military-industrial complex was just that, 
a complex, a loose web of governmental 
procurement agencies and private in-
dustrial firms. But Robert McNamara 
and his Wunderkinder changed all that, 
acording to Melman. They tightened up 
the organization, and, for all practical 
purposes, made the private firms into 
mere subsidiary arms of the Department 
of Defense. 


In the new "State Management," as he 
calls the Department of Defense, orders 
come down from the top and are obeyed 
below. The dependent firms have nowhere 
else to go with their products. They have 
to sell them to the D epartment of Defense 
or not at all. 


The device which brought about this 
centralization was the Defense Supply 
Agency. McNamara replaced the various 
service procurement agencies with a single 
department-wide buyer. Everyone who 
wanted to sell something had to deal with 
the same people in the government. It no 
longer paid to play off one service against 
the other. 


The Department of Defense exercises 
a startling degree of control over its 
suppliers, says Melman. It can dictate 
salaries and wages, as well as materials. 
It not only sets quality requirements, but 
also procures capital for the firms to work 
with. The capital, $83 billion of it this year, 
comes from Congress. Melman sees the 
defense budget as an $83 billion leech on 
the body economic. 


"Military expenditures are parasitic. 
Military growth is parasitic. The difference 
is that goods and services that are func-
tionally productive are either part of the 
standard of living or are useful for further 
production. Parasitic developments 
are things that are not part of living 
or producing .... 


"As for the so-called spin-off effects of 
military research ... you don't do 
something best by doing something else. 
You do something best by doing it. Sure, 
we get some benefits from military re-
search, but we would get them a lot more 
quickly and efficiently if we went out 
looking for them instead of getting them 
as by-products of some useless Department 
of Defense or NASA project.'' 


The Vietnam war clearly qualifies as the 
most useless of all useless Department of 
Defense projects, and Melman caught on 
to what was happening there before most 
other people did. A signer of the pamphlet 
"A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority," 
later used as evidence of conspiracy in the 
trial of the Boston Five, he also personally 
warned MeN amara in 1965 about what 
was going to happen in Vietnam, only 
to receive a confident reply to the effect 
that Melman did not know what he was 
talking about. He describes looking at the 
grinning McNamara sitting serenely in 
his office beneath a portrait of the first 
Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal 
(who killed himself by jumping from the 
window of a mental institution), as "one 
of the few truly terrifying moments of my 
life." 


According to Melman, the military-
industrial machine gets away with all the 
legal and moral atrocities of Vietnam 
largely because it just has more resources 
at its disposal than anyone else. No one can 
stand up to it. It is twice the size of General 
Motors; it spends ten times as much as 
the Department of State on foreign policy 
research. In the name of "security" the 
Department of Defense can hire millions 
of technologists to spin out plans for 
different contingencies. The Pentagon 
even has a detailed contingency plan for 
American forces to fight their way 
through South Vietnamese troops to reach 
debarcation points in case of a sudden 
United States withdrawal. 


In addition, the Department of Defense 
has drawers full of contingency plans for 
the production of many weapons it does 
not already have or realistically need. As a 
result, when the President wants to pump 
some money into a sagging economy, as 
Kennedy did in the early sixties, he turns to 
the Department of Defense. The plans 
are already there; all he has to do is im-
plement them. The other branches of the 
government simply did not and do not 
have the funds and manpower on hand to 
draw up similar plans for hospitals, 
medical schools, libraries or rapid transit 
systems. 


Melman has been busy developing these 
peaceful contingency plans, working out 
the conversion of the economy to a non-
military economic base. There are, 
however, too many people dependent for 
their livelihood on the military-industrial 
state to permit its easy dismantling. 


Something has to be done with all those 
people, whose number, counting workers 
in subsidiary industries and their families, 
Melman estimates is a multiple of eight 
million. He will publish in February a five 
volume collection of papers, written 
mostly by his graduate students at 
Columbia, suggesting possible ways of 
carrying out the basic transformation 
of the economic structure of the United 
States which would be necessary to stop 
the war machine once and for all. He 
hopes the collection will be a starting point 
for a new national debate on how to avoid 
a military state. 


In a sense, Melman says, the military-
industrial system is producing in America 
the conditions of a backward country. 
'Â·One of the big things we point to when 
we are talking about the underdeveloped 
nations is their lack of an economic 
infrastructure: they don't have reliable 
communication, or transportation, or 
central power. Well, all those conditions 
occurred in New York City during July 
and August of 1969. The electrical supply 
sy;;te:m, Consolidated Edison, just broke 
down. There was no electricity. Trains 
and subways were hours late. Tele-
phone service got so bad that firms were 
taking full-page n.ewspaper ads just to Jet 
their customers know that they were 
still in existence. 


"In parts of New York the infant 
mortality rate compares unfavorably with 
that of several Latin American nations, 
usually the most notorious spots in that 
statistic. 


"We are not even holding our own any 
more; we're falling behind." 


The argument that all these problems 
are brought by the nature of modern 
technology itself leaves Melman cold. In 
fact he does not even explicitly condemn 
modern capitalism as one might expect. He 
just thinks that American capitalism is 
making its decisions on the basis of 
outdated criteria. The technology itself, 
he says, is neutral. 


"Two generations have been brought 
up in the present scene. In their lives, para-
sitic technology has consistently been 
portrayed as the important technology. 
And as a result many members of these 
generations identify 'technology' as 
parasitic military technology. There is a 
feeling that this is all that technology is, a 
feeling that technology is a Frankenstein's 
monster with an initiative of its own. But 
technology does not have a mind. It does 
not make decisions. It does not make 
choices among alternatives. Only man does 
these things." Only when man changes 
his social requirements will technology 
change. 


But technology has come to symbolize 
more than just the particular gadgets we 
' use in daily Hfe. The industrial system 
structures our society in its organizational 
image: a clear-cut hierarchy with bosses 
and workers, with some one to tell you 
what to do or what not to do. The alien-
ation that results comes not only from the 
technological minutiae of the production 
system itself but from the social relations 
which it fosters as well. 


Melman recognizes this and concedes 
that once a certain kind of technology gets 
going it does build up a momentum, if not 
initiative, of its own. Technology may have 
man's social preferences built into it, but 
after a while it has a hand in determining 
his social preferences as well. The sex 
machine advertising of the automobile 
industry makes this all too clear. Live 
vicariously in a Pontiac while you poison 
your children's air. 


If the only way to change the technology 
is to change man's requirements, the 
hierarchical system of organization would 
seem to be among the first things to go. 
Melman considers the former SDS ideal of 
participatory democracy as an alternative 
way of structuring economic production, 
and perhaps society at large. Until now the 
argument for participatory decision-
making has always run aground on the 
question of the alleged inefficiency of its 
operation. Critics contend that workers 
will spend as much time in meetings as 
they will on the production line. Melman 
claims that the critics are short-sighted.ln 
modern industry there are four managers 
for every ten workers anyway, he says, 
and the savings in administration overhea'd 
could offset the loss of work time which 
would result from a cooperative, societal Â· 
and economic structure. 


The implications of Melman's careful 
and painstakingly executed research are 
vast; they indicate that there may be a way 
out if the American people can somehow 
be persuaded that it is worth a try. Per-
suading the people is the important part. 


"We'll know we're getting somewhere 
when the day comes that no one can get 
elected to any office-not even to dog 
catcher-unless he is against Vietnam and 
anything like it. Yes, and anything like it. 
The Pentagon just churns these things out 
operationaly. It won't stop by itself. When 
enough people are against all these wars, 
the structure of the Department of Defense 
and the whole set of national priorities 
will have to change. But as long as Con-
gress supplies the money and soldiers obey 
their orders they will continue. 


"The problem is that tl1e technology 
of American foreign policy bas changed, 
but the imagery which accompanies it has 
not." The professor, who conducts sem-
inars with businessmen all over the 
country trying to explain the changes in 
foreign policy, uses the example of the 
TV western to illustrate the problem. 


"Most people still look at international 
relations with the 'High Noon' model. 
They see international affairs as a con-
frontation between states. In a confronta-
tion between the sheriff and the bad man, 
it makes a difference whether or not the 
sheriff is well trained, quick on the draw, 
and has a good pistol- maybe two pistols 
(two is better than one, you know). And 
the sheriff and the bad man face each 
other and draw, and one of them is killed. 


"Well, we're playing the game with 
nuclear bullets now. And suddenly it no 
longer matters who shoots first. As soon 
as a shot is fired-by anyone-the bad man 
goes up in smoke, the sheriff goes up in 
smoke, the whole country goes up in 
smoke." 


For ten years Seymour Melman was the 
lonesome sheriff going out to face the 
bad military-industrial machine, a lonely 
but insistent voice crying out in the tech-
nological wasteland. Now things are 
different. Even MIT, that decadent arm 
of the bankrupt society, is holding con-
ferences on how to convert to a peace-
oriented economy; now even the whiz 
kids care about a conversion. But the 
whiz kids do not have power any more. 
They have been replaced by another 
administration, another party. Maybe the 
whiz kids learned a lesson from the last 
five years, but it no longer matters. Mel-
man is not alone any longer, but that is 
small consolation as the military-industrial 
machine grinds on and on. 


America's infinite misfortune is that it 
took Vietnam- where the military-indus-
trial leviathan wastes $400,000, 75 bombs, 
150 artillery shells, and countless rounds 
of small arms fire to kill each poorly 
equipped VietCong soldier-to make even 
those few, now powerless, technocrats see 
the point. What will it take to convince 
the ones who are now in power? ~
