EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Do our schools, then, intentionally 
foster an economic system contrary to the 
expressed ideology of the society for 
which it is preparing its students? It would 
seem so, although the paradox is not 
as acute as it would seem at first glance. 
There are clear reasons for the refusal 
to practice the system that is preached. 
Commercial barons have not been 
traditionally concerned with the creation 
of other commercial barons. They are 
interested in instructing their future labor 
force in areas and habits which will 
increase individual productivity and sus-
tain the factory owner as a wealth owner. 
Moreover, to suggest that large num.bers of 
the economically disenfranchised should 
be informed in the subtleties of market-
place behavior is to make the mistake 
of taking capitalism at its word. Tutoring 
the common man in rudimentary financial 
practices would turn the exploited into 
the exploiters while simultaneously 
equipping poor people with the 
knowledge they need to calculate the 
liabilities of the market system they enter. 
The absence of practical education in 
economics is contrary to the basic premises 
of a capitalist society within a democratic 
setting. We are producing high-school 
graduates who have had no systematic 
instruction in the rationale of the world in 
which they live. They fail to understand 
the market economy; they are unable 
to conceive of the abstract idea of invest-
ment, the power of money to earn money. 
Public schools fail to prepare stu-
dents to earn income or to preserve the 
wealth they do manage to obtain. What 
economic experience is available is 
generated from the ruthless environment 
of the street with its thieves, hustlers and 
prostitutes and from its drug merchants 
who cruise school corridors. If student 
experience in economics is limited to 
illicit activities, then the school's structure 
reinforces the extra-legal behavior and 
systematically destroys his respect for law. 
The administrative hierarchy of a school 
has much in common with government, 
but many of its judicial practices seem 
designed to warp the student experience 
with law and with governance. The legal 
system of the school appears to be at odds 
with the avowed purpose of socializing 
the student so he can function in a 
democratic society. What public school 
student has been guaranteed due process 
when a member of the official hierarchy 
has lodged a complaint against him? 
Does the student stand trial before a ran-
domly selected group of peers, or 
before a group whose membership in the 
ruling elite convinces itself that leniency 
on any one count precedes the total break-
down of the school's social order? In 
which schools are students, who must 
defend themselves against the charges of 
illegal behavior, actually confronted 
by their accusors? Can anyone remember 
an occasion when a student has been 
permitted to ask witnesses to appear in his 
defense? Do we even allow student 
defendants an understanding of their 
rights and privileges before the law? 
Few if· any measures are taken to insure 
the fairness of officials who judge student 
offenders. Processes unthinkable in even 
the most conservative courtrooms are 
standard procedure in the most liberal 
schools. And if we turn the coin over, and 
imagine the administrators of the school 
legal system subject to the identical process 
applied to students, we immediately see 
that school-law is a one-way street. 
Teachers are above the legal system, and 
it is nearly impossible for a student to 
even lodge charges against a member of 
the faculty. There are no precedents 
for fair hearings of disputes between 
student and teacher when the action is 
brought by the student; law is synonomous 
with the "establishment" in the school. 


The impartial administration of 
justice is fundamental to the ideology 
of democracy, but our school systems 
fail to employ acceptable standards of 
justice within their spheres of influence, 
and neglect to follow by example what 
they preach. The absence of impartial 
panels leads to a system of presumed 
student guilt in all conflicts between stu-
dents and teachers. One of the most 
disturbing aspects of school judicial 
process is the utter absence of the right of 
the accused to a trial. He is often judged 
secretly, and notations are added indis-
criminately to his permanent file. Even the 
common criminal has better protection 
under democratic law than children do in 
their schools. 

As it happens, circumstantial evidence 
is sufficient for conviction of an alleged 
offender, and students are frequently tried 
for their associations with the "bad crowd" 
rather than for particular offenses. 
The permanent file which records the 
transgressions of students against duly 
constituted authority, is identical in 
purpose with the state's usage of the 
criminal record; both records follow the 
offender as written history throughout 
his association with societal institutions. 
The permanent file eventually becomes 
the possession of the school guidance 
counselor who uses the information there-
in to write an otherwise anonymous 
recommendation to the college the student 
hopes to attend. It follows that the student 
who allows himself to be embroiled in 
controversies or protests against the indig-
nities of his educational environment 
stands a poor chance of entering a highly 
selective college. 

If the school's limitations on student 
communication and mobility are combined 
with the added restrictions on his legal 
rights and the irrelevance of the curricu-
lum and educational structure to his 
ultimate professional and economic goals, 
we begin to recognize a form of govern-
ment consistent not with democracy 
but with corporatist and oligarchic ideol-
ogies. The Constitution says that the 
citizen has the "right to be free of searches 
and seizures," yet searches and seizures 
of personal property are a common 
occurrence in the school. The denials of 
student rights extend to other articles 
of the U.S. Constitution. Press censor· 
ship, prohibitions against assembly, the 
regulation of speech, denial of right to 
petition for redress of grievances are 
commonplace in our schools and are 
becoming more and more frequent as the 
student protest movement filters down 
to the public school level. The principles 
in the Constitution granting and limiting 
power, which are designed to prevent the 
depositing of unlimited aut!,lority in the 
hands of the government, are absent in 
the process we call education. 

It is remarkable that the agent for the 
perpetuation of the hallowed traditions 
and institutions of the United States 
should itself so lack these qualities. 
The components of our system of 
educational coercion are derived from 
state compulsory education laws. In 
saying this, I do not mean, of course, to 
suggest that the system of coercion can be 
overhauled by the simple abrogation of 
a handful of statutes. But still, compulsory 
education laws have done much to turn 
our schools into custodial institutions, and 
have added to the confusion of purpose 
which diminishes the viability of the 
educational offerings. Schools have been 
asked to perform the dual role of 
stimulator of the educational demand 
and supplier of educational services, 
which is unfortunate because ideally the 
students themselves should stimulate the 
demand. This is not a healthy relationship, 
since it leaves the institutions unaccount-
able to anyone but themselves, and permits 
their student populations to be captive 
markets with no influence over the supply 
of goods offered to them.


What is the significance of this type of 
school system? When students do not 
know why they are in school, and are not 
consulted about their own goals, they 
see no purpose in the curriculum offerings, 
and their presence becomes counterpro-
ductive to the attempted learning activities. 
Instead of concentrating on irrelevant and 
often boring academic work, those who 
reject course offerings create for them-
selves a political and social life inside 
the classroom that is far more interesting 
than the fare forced on them for 
consumption. The dynamics of this 
"extra-curricular" life can be described as 
war between the social factions within 
the school, or, stated in a more rhetorical 
way, as a miniature class struggle. 

This class struggle becomes the real 
curriculum of the school. It pits five groups 
against one another: the administration, 
the faculty, and three student factions-
the "monitors," or students who cooperate 
with the existing system and perform the 
tasks it requires; the "mafiosini," or 
students who refuse to cooperate with the 
totalitarian classroom state and become 
discipline problems instead; and the 
passive students, who are caught between 
the approved hierarchy of the monitors 
and the underworld of the mafiosini. The 
passive student does not rebel against 
the school; he accepts it, but he must live 
out his days dealing with both extreme 
power groups if he is to survive. 

The struggle between these groups is 
the result of many social forces outside 
the school, of course, as well as the actu-
al system within the classroom. But it is 
highly certain that the struggle would take 
a markedly different form were our 
school systems not dictatorial institutions 
of coercion. 

Coercion in urban schools begins with 
the requirement of compulsory atten-
dance, which is a curious inversion of the 
historical intent of state legislation on the 
subject. This legislation, which enabled 
every citizen to be educated at state 
expense, was considered the great 
equalizer in its time, since it prevented 
parents from sending their children into 
factories instead of to school. But times 
have changed, and what was progressive 
in Horace Mann's era may have become 
oppressive in our own. Student confine-
ment has forced schools to develop 
programs to satisfy those who wish to 
involve themselves in activities outside 
the academic program. The academic 
curricuJum of the school is a compromise 
incorporating the wishes of those who 
are content with those who are alienated. 
In the process of pleasing such divergent 
interests it debases the integrity of its 
programs by planning for the median 
student and sacrificing both the bright and 
the dull to its standardized fare. 

Forced attendance implies, furthermore, 
that the student would not be willing to 
seek out an education, and from this 
implication are derived others which are 
fundamental elements of a despotic, 
custodial regime. As this regime matures, 
it is only natural that it begins to prescribe 
in detail, minute regulations for the effi-
cient running of its society. In turn, these 
regulations must be enforced, implying 
the need for a penal code associating 
offenses with penalties. 

This sedimentary process, years of 
creating and amending legal and penal 
codes, consumes the major energies 
of personnel within the school. The "class 
war" becomes the hidden curriculum 
that teachers unwillingly teach, and that 
students willingly learn. 

Nothing instructs so effectively or as 
systematically as the structure of the 
school. The medium is the message; 
curriculum developers who insist on 
devoting effort to improve lesson plans 
and to apply instructional technology 
face ceaseless frustration, for what they 
are tinkering with is only peripheral to 
the problem. Changing the academic 
curriculum misses the point, for the 
primary deficiency of our schools is in 
structure, not in content. It is the 
structure, the structure so inconsistent 
with the stated goals of democracy, that 
creates the "class war" which students 
so eagerly engage in at the expense of 
learning. And who can blame them? Even 
the most extraordinary innovations in 
curriculum content are weak in contrast 
to the dynamics of a structural process. 
It is so much more exciting to play 
the power game in school than to read 
the books. 

But if the cancer of public education is 
located within the medium itself, then 
change is possible-insofar as educators 
can replace the present custodial structure 
with one that will instruct our children 
in the real economic, political and social 
spheres. In short, schools must be 
reflections of the present, rather than the 
remnants of a feudal era.~
