Designs in the sky
Chris Argyris was playing the devil's advocate. The skywriting of a large peace sign over the Boston Common on Moratorium Day, said the professor of administrative sciences, actually served to polarize those who saw it, not to unite them. 

Marvin Torffield, a Yale artist now about to embark on an experiment with skywriting as an art form, saw it otherwise. "We are too isolated, too separated in the urban environment," he said. "We don't have enough collective experiences." 

Torffield's idea is to make large skywriting designs over urban areas, thus aiding residents in establishing the sense of community their cities so lack. He presented his plans at a seminar for invited guests from the Yale community one evening last week. The scene was the Art and Architecture Building conference room, so it looked like it was going to be pretty formal. But Torffield and Argyris clashed anyway. 

"It's not unfair for a citizen to ask, 'What do you want to do with my sky and my community?' " said Argyris. "Is that sort of Woodstock closeness that you're trying to establish here necessarily good over a long period of time?" 

"The individual isn't strong enough to face all that is fighting him in his environment and still attain a closeness," retorted Torffield. 

But whether making designs in the sky was the right way to start bringing people together was never quite established, and most of those present remained skeptical. 

"Are you looking for how to get a welfare mother in New Haven to feel a common bond with a welfare administrator?" one guest asked Torffield. "Well, the way sure as hell isn't skywriting." 

Wayne Mansfield, the skywriting pilot who created the peace sign over the Boston Common and inscribed a similar one over the Woodstock Music Festival last summer, was also present, and gave a down-to-earth explanation of skywriting. 

"I felt pretty good about making those peace signs, and having 100,000 people below all looking up together because of me," he said. Mansfield explained that the line of smoke that forms skywriting letters is three hundred feet in diameter, and the average letter is about three-quarters of a mile long. Many designs run as long as fifteen miles through the sky. Torffield likes that large size. One of his planned projects is an outline of thirteen-mile long Manhattan Island, which he plans to have written in New Jersey and float gently across the Hudson River to come into place right above Manhattan. 

Many of those attending Torffield's presentation were not antagonistic toward skywriting itself-they just felt it was irrelevant to the real problem of bringing unity to a community. "To inject skywriting into the problems of the world is like playing court jester," said one student on his way out. 

Torffield hopes to counteract skywriting's image as an advertising device by creating shapes and forms, rather than words, in the sky. But here too, he ran up against opposition. Someone suggested a butterfly: "That would surely bring us closer." 

"No," someone else said. "It would make us think that someone was selling butterflies."

It was not that we sought to withdraw into that privileged sanctuary of Yale when we moved fifteen feet down College Street and onto Yale property after the police had told us to move. We were removing ourselves to a place where we thought we had a right to be. 

The four of us had been talking on College Street about community control of education, of commercial facilities, and of the police when the New Haven police arrived. 

"Get moving there or we'll put you under arrest!" 

Since our discussion had just gotten us to that precise point where the viability of the American Constitution was questioned, I responded, choosing for the sake of discussion to defend the system. 

"Why? We live right here," pointing to the Old Campus. Three of us indeed did live on the Old Campus, and we were having a conversation on what was virtually our front stoop. So that when one officer repeated, "Look, you punks, you're on a public sidewalk and when we tell you to move, you move," we thought it quite reasonable to step off the sidewalk and onto the Yale campus. I pointed out to the gentlemen that we were no longer on the public sidewalk. 

By this time, the two policemen had left their squad car; three of us had paused farther down the street while one, more radical than the rest of us, was still walking down the sidewalk shouting back to us, "Okay, stick up for your constitutional rights and see where they'll get you." 

Another one of us walked over to the police and explained that we were Yale students simply holding a discussion and that we lived on the Old Campus. We're clearing the Green tonight, they answered, and Yale students are no exception. 

"But we're not on the Green." 

"Are those your steps?" asked the cop pointing to old, unused steps at Welsh Hall. 

"Well, no, not exactly." 

"Then you're loitering. Do you want me to spell it? L-0-I-T-E-R-I-N-G." He flicked on the radio and began speaking to headquarters. Both policemen approached and asked us to step down onto the sidewalk. We were under arrest. Unwilling to be arrested, I politely declined and suggested they talk to the campus police. 

"We don't need any campus police. If you don't come down, we'll drag you down." 

"Do you have a warrant?" 

But the police wagon had already continued on page 15
