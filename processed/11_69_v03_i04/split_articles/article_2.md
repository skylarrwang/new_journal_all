Quite Lowell, Mass., Friday morning, clear cold, clean, workaday Lowell with deserted textile mill, biggest, emptiest building in the world behind St. Jean Baptiste ("He went about doing good") Catholic church, grey on the outside but saintly cavernous on the inside, marble cupola alter, saint glass windows-half the wealth of dying Lowell exhibited at Jack Kerouac's original and final church. 

Groups of two and three pea-coated college gurus and would-be saints leaning and sitting across the street at a boarded-up drug store before entering the church, thinking Lowell and not understanding at all ... "This town, it meant so much to him .... " 

Where was Dr. Sax, chthonic saint of Kerouac's beautiful childhood, whose shadowy Basil Rathbone essence lurked and haunted him on Fall nights? Fall nights. October. Kerouac's favorite month. Month of long cold walks from Maggie Cassidy's house, walks of sweet-sick adolescent love ... French Canadian high school innocence and wondering ... 

October nights later in misty Southern Pacific freight train yards ... October nights of Wolfean Manhattan discovery walks ... October nights of warm Florida loneliness, drunkenness and death. 

WHDH News crew, Channel Five Boston, stationed in front of the church, their cameras recording the more colorful attenders of the Beatnik writer's funeral. But they have to scramble; the crowd is somber and dull. Relatives, readers, neighbors, and poets Corso, Orlovsky, Ferlinghetti. And Ginsberg a pall bearer with boyhood friends of Kerouac's. 

The casket is rolled to the front of the aisle and solemn Requiem Mass begins with the uncertain, unrosaried congregation standing and sitting only on direction of the priest who reads from Revelations: "Write the things which thou hast seen and the things which are, and the things that shall be hereafter." Then he tells how Kerouac had come to them in his youth for advice, encouragement and comfort, then left Lowell to chronicle himself for others, living among "the mad ones, mad to talk, mad to live, desirous of everything at the same time," and finally returning to share the visions of Gerard, his nine-year-old brother who died when Kerouac was four. 

Kerouac spoke of other visions in his books ("All I write about is Jesus"); shrouded desert figures always following. To him a reminder of some lost bliss of the womb, never experienced again till death. He told Neal Cassady about this and "because we're all of us never in life again, he rightly, would have nothing to do with it, and I (Kerouac) agreed with him then." 

But later he envisioned death as eternal peace and freedom
... I wish I was free
Of that slaving meat wheel
And safe in heaven dead.

And now he was. Followed out to the hearse by the hundred and fifty who hadn't half-filled the church. Somebody dropped a toothbrush in the aisle, Gregory Corso was taking movies on the church steps, and Peter Orlovsky waved at some acquaintances while police untangled traffic for the procession to graveside.


**Title: Are our schools really preparing us?**
**Author: George Richmond**

Our schools are more than bad; they are incompatible with the very structure of our society.

The right to self-determination is denied to three groups in this country: convicts, the insane and students. Membership in any one of these groups carries with it a suspension of legal and property rights, and a precedent of subservience contrary to the intentions of the Constitution. While the curtailment of the legal and property rights of convicts and the insane is dangerous to all who seek the protection of the Bill of Rights, the abatement of law, of justice and of ownership as applied to the student population poses an even more serious threat. 

Our youth are the inheritors of both our wealth and our democratic traditions. Neither will remain safe if we continue to school our young through a system that so totally ignores both their legal and their property rights. 

From our educational system, it would seem as though our children were being prepared for a propertyless state, whose laws are legislated and administered by a despot. Selected from among a group of card-carrying civil servants, the despot-the teacher-is a vestige of the form of colonialism that characterized the first half of the twentieth century. He is the inheritor of the "white man's burden" and he is equally unwilling to allow the natives to govern. That public schools offer no practical, experiential education in governance and in the economic or legal enterprise that is so vital to the "American system" is remarkable in a society so imbued with the ideology of capitalism and democracy as is the United States. 

George Richmond '66, Director of the Transitional Year Program at Yale, has devised an entire curriculum based on the use of play money and game theory for use in urban schools. An experiment with his system during this past summer was the subject of a major article in New York magazine last September. Besides being an educator, Mr. Richmond is also an accomplished artist. 

The reality of the school is at variance with the ideology expressed in our traditions and vocalized as the "national interest." Few ownership experiences are available to children via the school. All the resources of the classroom-the desks, the chairs, the blackboards, the paper, the books and other school materials-are the property of the state. Teachers preach an ethos of sharing, of equal opportunity, and of an equal division of wealth that is surprisingly unfaithful to reality. If a child brings a sweet to school, he is under strong pressure to distribute a portion of his treasure to his peers. Student sale of goods and services within the school building is discouraged where it is not met with strict prohibition. Only the teacher can sell cookies, but even here the profits go to the state. 

These are hardly the principles that form the underpinnings of a capitalist state. 

Even the dominant economic institutions of our society are absent in our schools. Which of us has ever encountered a marketplace in a school? Yet the marketplace is central to the efficient functioning of our economy. Similarly, the absence of a marketplace in our schools implies an absence of tutoring in the behavior of markets, and, in fact, this is the case. Most of the students who graduate from public school systems are frozen out of the economy both in terms of what they have to offer to the labor market, and in terms of their understanding of the market economy. 

There are two ways for poor children to acquire property. The quickest way is to steal it, and this manner of acquisition is widely practiced, in various forms: extortion, confidence games, pickpocketing, etc. One student from a New York high school reported that the football team in his school made a regular practice of collecting loot from the gymnasium lockers since they had access to the lock combinations. When students uncovered the thieves, the football team threatened the discoverers with physical harm if they exposed the thefts. 

The second way to acquire property is to barter one item for another or to sell goods for currency. In a sense, the teacher demonstrates a barter economy as he trades grades and privileges for cooperation and other forms of reciprocation. The exchange of an item for currency, however, is infrequent, since students, by and large, have only indirect access to legitimate sources of funds. One exception to the otherwise primitive economic activity in the schools is the recent development of a drug market within the urban high school. Within this market sellers, buyers and middlemen are easily distinguished while profits are reaped at every level of the distribution ladder. The medium of exchange is U.S. currency.
