Drest in a little brief authority 
Most ignorant of what he is most 
assured 
His glassy essence like an angry ape 
Plays such fantastic tricks before high

Gentlemen, Let's get one thing straight 
once and for all: The policeman isn't 
there to create disorde r. The police man 
is there to preserve disorder. 
- R. Daley, Aug. 1968



Come sit and cack 
With lusty back 
But leave no wrack 
Beside our closet 
Void, spurt and pump 
Yourturdous rump 
But leave no lump 
He re for deposit 
He shall shame 
Who misses aim 
Let St. Anthony's flame 
Burn his scut sear. 
Who does not swab 
His thingumbob 
All the last blob 
Ere he leave here

I pray thee now my good stout lads 
with handsome pricks held betwixt 
half-hidden in your bone y heads, pass 
on in detail all thy truths that w e might 
be amused in learning. Describe to us 
in good faith and in good nature and, 
pray Thee, spare not one horrid tale 
that ye may know, for the likes of us are 
wont of better things and better places 
and any grain of truth that might

The quality of female graffiti at Yale 
has been quite inferior. But until this 
year the sample has been quite limited. 
Moreover Kinsey reports that " relatively 
few females ever make wall inscr ip-
tions. When they do, fewer of the in-
scriptions are sexual and only a small 
proportion of the sexual material seems 
to provide erotic stimulation for the 
inscribers or for the persons who ob-
serve the inscriptions." How Kinsey 
obtained this latter conclusion is indeed 
questionable. Nevertheless, most of the 
feminine artistry consists in " Gather ye 
rosebuds while ye may," which appears 
from Hungry Charley's to Connecticut 
Hall. The prose is always too flowery 
and often unintelligible: 
Love looks not with the eye, but with 
the mind and therefore is winged 
cupid blind

Whatever a human being's relation-
ship is to his graffiti has yet to be 
examined. The subject has evinced 
little research money. A re graffiti folk 
art? Simple communication? Does it 
have a formal vocabulary and what are 
its myths? To measure men by their 
graffiti may not be truly successful or 
fair. As one Yale student wrote at the 
end of a sociology paper in good 
graffiti style, "The reductionistic pitfalls 
have caused nostalgia to lose its norma-
tive st ructure." ~
