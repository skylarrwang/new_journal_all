71 The New Journal I November 9, 1969 
This is an anthology of Yale writing 
first and a compendium of libelous 
claims and offensive pornography 
second. Time did not allow the author 
to pore over the hundreds of desk tops 
in Yale classrooms where a virtually 
untapped resource for future graffiti 
research is to be found. In all cases the 
original diction, grammar, and punctua-
tion has been preserved. The author's 
gratitude extends to the anonymous 
and unsung creative spirits at Yale 
whose tireless efforts in restrooms 
have made this article possible. 
Unlike ambiguity there are eight 
types of graffiti: Doggerel, punning, 
dialectic mimesis, caricature, parody, 
directives, memorials and obscenity. 
This last is unfortunately the most 
familiar type. In Cannibals and Chris-
tians, however, Norman Mailer ob-
serves that "some of the best prose in 
America is graffiti found on men's 
room walls." While Mailer would 
not have slighted women's rooms had 
he visited Yale's School of Art and 
Architecture, he is shrewd to point out 
that with the rise of the educated and 
professional-and thus repressed-
classes, more sophisticated and sub-
limated forms of graffiti have sprung 
up in San Francisco pubs, Manhattan 
office buildings and at colleges across 
the country. 

The Yale community, for example, 
can luxuriate in such doggerel as this 
found in the Freshman Buttery: 
In the Fuzz 
Once I was 
Now lam 
But are you fit 
To be full of shit 
Forever seek the proper hole 
or resign yourself a mole 
It will seep 
If you beep 
Porforapeep 
'Quizonimpeep 
While you sleep 
And as you keep 
As one of the sheep 
Rememberopeep 
The past tense of rape 
Is .... reep 
Or in this dialectic mimicry from the 
Art and Architecture Building: 
A Amelia Earhardt is alive and well 
selling girdles in Macy's basement. 
B That's strange, you don't look 
Jewish 
C I don't smoke 
D Neither does Judge Crater look 
Argentinian. 
Or such directives as "Pray for Piece" 
and " Fantasy must be fulfilled." One 
could say that graffiti writing itself is 
fantasy-fulfilling. 
Mike Deasy, an M.A. candidate in City 
Planning, is president of the new 
Student Community Housing Corpora-
tion in New Haven. 

Freud in his Jokes and Their Relation 
to the Unconscious describes parody 
and travesty as that comic attempt to 
destroy "the unity that exists between 
people's character as we know them 
and their speeches and action, by re-
placing either the exalted figures or 
their utterances by inferior ones." Yale 
restrooms abound with this type of 
graffito. Once again the Art and A rchi-
tecture Building demonstrates this: 
Jesus was a haploid 
A What would Marshall Mcluhan write 
on this wall? 
B Nothing unless he was paid 
C Nothing, he can't write 
But the most devasting travesty of all: 
A Donald Duck is a lesbian 
B AQuack 

The array of Yale graffiti defies cate-
gorization. The form, content, quantity 
and level of perception vary with school 
and department. This would suggest 
that even graffiti are susceptible to 
sociological analysis even though hu-
manists undoubtedly would rebel at 
reducing man to his anonymous mural 
outbursts, and social scientists would 
quake to scrutinize the subjective and 
random evidence occasioned by ali-
mental evacuation. What scholar could 
submit the following to content 
analysis? 
whereat 
wear a hat 
chew the fat 
rat-tat-tat 
Dirty rat 
Have a Chat 
Brand New Hat 
Here I sat 
Dont Stand Pat 
Skin the Cat

MTARRARAT 
EMPTOR CAVEAT 

What zealots wash away, anthropolo-
gists should hold dear for the study of 
contemporary society. The humblest 
artifacts are often the most revealing, 
and the commonest graffito could re-
veal the deepest unconscious of an 
entire society. "The joke, it can be said, 
is the contribution made to the comic 
from the realm of the unconscious," 
writes Freud. If graffiti, like dreams, are 
really the condensed formats for 
societal wishes, then the freshman 
who wrote on the Durfee Buttery walls 
"God is alive and living in terror" could 
be said to have made a reflection upon 
the over-awed state of mind upon leav-
ing the fishbowl and entering the 
ocean. 

A. W. Read, a scholar from Columbia 
University, remarks that "a sociologist 
does not refuse to study certain crim-
inals on the ground that they are too 
dastardly; surely a student of language 
is even less warranted in refusing to 
consider certain four letter words be-
cause they are too 'nasty' or too 'dirty'." 
It is clear that graffiti warrant more 
study both as to their genesis and to 
their use as social indicators. 

A Why should the bathroom be such a 
vessel for repressed sexual feeling? 
B Queer you should bring that up. 

Indeed the response to this question is 
not accurate. Hopefully, graffiti demon-
strate more than what is queer, but 
rather the inner thoughts, unconscious 
wishes and repressed feelings of a 
broad spectrum of society. When a law 
student or professor writes in the Ster-
ling law Building basement, "Where 
can I find a good whorehouse?" he is 
expressing virtually the same sentiment 
as "Virginity is like a bubble" when 
written by the scientist in the Kline 
Chemistry men's room or the senti-
ment, "love me that I may fuck you 
with a pure heart" when w ritten in the 
Freshman Buttery. And yet the form 
varies from the logical, to the analogi-
cal, to the idealistically exhortatory of 
the undergraduate. No such sentiment 
has been written yet on the walls of the 
Hall of Graduate Studies. The form is 
consistent from school to school with 
other sentiment as well. Thus, one 
expects the walls of the law School 
johns to speak clearly but not always 
forthrightly: 
A Montana is a myth 
B law is a myth 
C Yale is a myth 
D (Invocation and application) 
E Sowhat? 
F (Appraisal) 
G Smart ass law student 
H Nothing is absolute 
A Good night, David. 
B Good night, Goliath 
A Une pierre qui roule n'amasse pas 
de mousse. 
B A perambulating lithoidal accrues no 
lichen. 

Undergraduate writing, on the other 
hand, is expected to be pretentious, ex-
tended, self-conscious and often politi-
cal. Once again, the Freshman Buttery's 
1968 edition provides a clue to under-
graduate effort: 
A I'm in love with a girl but I don't 
know she exists. 
B How do you know you don't know? 
C How do you know you know you 
don't know? 
D Because, douchebag. 
E Self referential problem. (cf Russell's 
Theory of) 
A Gametes of the world unite! 
B Good people of the earth, leave Yale. 
It is 2 AM-I'm starving and the god-
dam door is locked 

This graffitii is definitely inferior to the 
1971 edition. In fad it sucks.

most Durfee entryway generated what

most certainly is the distillate of fresh-
man mural writing. Hanging conven-
iently near the toilet to prevent 
plagiarism was the pamphlet-sized 
anthology Graffiti written by Robert 
Reisner in 1967. It served to insure a 
healthy originiality and continuous 
dialogue that recognized itself as par-
ticipating in an art form: 
A Mozart is alive and in Haydn. 
B Can you Bach that up with a Lizst of 
facts? 
C What a Barbarous question. 
D lves shown that the Rameaufications 
are endless so that I couldn't begin 
to Janecek it out; be Cagey, or you'll 
never un-Ravel it.

A Sex is not a cure for loneliness. 
B Profound, that 
Malthus is a spoil sport. 
A Psychiatry transcends Marxism 
B Theology transcends God. Oh yeah, 
God. 
C Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.

Get ahead-that's where it's at.

Marxism is the opiate of the intel-

Jiggedly, jingle, jaunty, j01unty Joyce

Think how lucky the lndi01ns would 
hilve been if Columbus had filllen over 
the edge. 

Yet another center for undergraduate 
writing (not to exclude the faculty 
fellowship) has been the men's room off 
the Berkeley College common room. 
The 1968-1969 edition was entitled 
'The Existential Reader': 
A You can't trick our Dick! 
B (A common penis?) 
C No, our president 
You feel such 01 luk of inter01ction and 
communic01tion with your fellow man 
that you resort to writing on these walls. 
A Purge the walls, we need a new 
generation of graffiti 
B Then it seems we are in a generation 
gap 
C At least 9 months 
You write on walls? Do you shit in your 
notebooks? 
A Th01nk god for mixers, when all those 
girls get frustrated they let it out on

B I wish it were on our balls 
Gr01ffiti: ink washed by the seas of time 
(and by the janitor) 
Dear janitor: you clean the walls OK, 
try the floors sometime 
A Classicism: 
Fuck you 
B Romanticism: Fuck me 
C Realism: 
Masturbation 

Although one contributor to the above 
Berkeley edition protests graffiti as an 
unsocial act, Freud insists over and over 
again that jokes....:and graffiti a re a 
species of jokes-are "the most social 
of all mental functions that aim at a 
yield of pleasure." One of the most 
notorious examples of graffiti communi-
cations has accumulated in Hendrie 
Hall. Despite numerous attempts at 
whitewashing, good specimens can 
still be seen. 
A I'd walk a mile for a camel 
B Think how far you'd walk for a 
woman! 
C Oh, I don't know-after all, a umel 
does have a bigger hump. 
D Hell, I'd walk a mile for a hump 
E Ever try fucking a camel after walk· 
inga mile? 
F Ever try walking a mile after fucking 
a camel? 
G What happened to the woman? 
Support A,E,I,O,U 
Start a vowel movement 
A Boy, Candy was a shitty movie. 
B Yeah, Candy was a box orifice 
smuhl 
Fuck, why be so subtle 

The lack of graffiti may be as telling 
as their presence. The Kline Biology 
Tower restrooms, the women's rooms 
of the residential college dining halls; 
Dwight Hall; the bathrooms of the 
academic departments except political 
science, English, history, and Slavic 
languages; and most bathrooms in the 
residential colleges-all lack graffiti and 
betray the character of their users. 
(Curiously, Philip Johnson designed 
excellent walls to induce graffiti writ-
ing in the Biology Tower: The restrooms 
are completely paved with white tile, 
yet the pristine sterility is respected.) 

What is w ritten in the Graduate 
School tends to be written in quite 
small and orderly letters. A whole graf-
fito in good compositional form can 
often be found lurking in an inch-square 
tile in HGS. The graffiti of scholars are 
well endowed with literary and phil-
osophical references, such as the Eng-
lish Department's "The thing-in-itself 
is alive and well in Konigsberg." Al-
though empirical research would show 
that the thing-in-itself no longer takes 
strolls in Konigsberg, fiction writing 
is allowed by English critics in the bath-
room where they are free from the con-
straints of facticity. Fiction is alive in the 
English Department. In other depart-
ments, graffiti writing ranges from the 
political to the Freudian travesty: 
USSR = SS

Where did all the wonderful graffiti go? 
Some people have no appreciation for 
contemporary art forms these days. 

Beyond any doubt the best graffiti at 
Yale can be found in the Art and Archi-
tecture Building. It is here that the 
limits of the form are tested, expanded 
and changed. Graffiti here cannot be 
said to only arouse titillation or disgust 
o r to fulfill unconscious desires. Graf-
fiti at the School of Art and Architecture 
realize the quest of the artist to fill the 
mural void. Certain technical develop-
ments over the last decade have made 
graffiti as an art form possible: Clear, 
light-colored tile that has taken the 
place of d ark marble-walled stalls; 
better bathrom lighting; but most 
especially the felt-tipped pen. Color, 
painterly effects, the variety of line 
and texture had not been possible be-
fore the felt tip. Much of the visual 
artistry of the A&A g raffiti cannot trans-
late into written words and should be 
viewed first hand:

B He thinks you can't spell, you

C He doesn't think. Do you think he 
put up these walls? 

There are, however, the disgruntled 
in any subculture who find art either 
unproductive or too critical: 
A This is the most insipid graffiti any-
where. It doesn't achieve any 
positives; it is not obscene or funny 
or clever or nihilistic or anarchistic 
or affirmative. It is ve ry dull graffiti.

D Since when is dullness a drag 
E It's not meant to be graffiti- it's 
fagritti 
F This is all pathological exhibitionism 
If protesting is alright 
Then solving is our duty. 

Some of the disgruntled in this case are 
those in power who have been waging 
a five year war against the defacing of 
Paul Rudolph's sculptured walls. A 
g raffito explains it best: "There has 
been an attempt to whitewash the 
facts. The system hides and trys to 
ignore what it does not like, FIGHT 
BACK." Some of the best editions of 
graffiti have been lost to posterity 
beneath the layers of whitewash. long 
before the controversies over financial 
equity and the City Planning Depart-
ment, there had been the controversy 
over the bathroom walls. The con-
troversy sprung its quiet furor over the 
very walls under protest: 
Blue Meanies strike again 
A Sic transit gloria mundi 
B Who's she? 
C Cousin of Myra Becken ridge 
A The walls belong to the people. 
B OK Let's start all over again, even 
tho 'twas ever thus! 
A The words shall be raised RAZED 
B Them words shall rise again 
C My eyes have seen the glory of the 
coming of the words 
D They have trampled down the vine-

A The paint on these walls merely ex· 
poses the superficiality of all 
institutions. 
B I think the old graffiti developed 
organically over the yeus was 
better. 

Much of the wall conversations 
naturally avert to architecture and its 
p ractice:

sincere:

B No, rather minced and served with

able height!"

Much of the dialogue reveals something 
of a literate background. Have archi-
tects w ritten these pieces or visitors to 
the building who receive inspiration 
from the bare concrete? Or are these 
pieces written by that singular soul 
known as the Fourth Floor Poet?
