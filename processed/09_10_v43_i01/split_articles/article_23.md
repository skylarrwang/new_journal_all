**To Be Remembered: A Quest for Zoological Nomenclature**
**Author: Zara Kessler**
**Page number(s): 30-31**

HIS SUMMER, a 75-million 
year old dinosaur skeleton was 
baptized the mojoceratops by 
Yale paleontologist Nicholas Longrich. 
If one Yalie made his mark this way, I 
thought, surely another can as well. 

A NEW GENUS 
OR SPECIES-GROUP 
NAME SHOULD BE SHORT AND 
EUPHONIOUS IN LATIN. 

I, Zara Kessler 
have decided to 
make a name for myself. To go down 
in history. To be eternally remembered. 
You'll find this nineteen-year-old in 
your textbooks one day. You'll search for 
this college sophomore in the depths of 
the jungle. You'll watch me swim by at 
the bottom of the sea, study me under 
your microscopes.· One day you'll write 
E. zarae in your notebooks. You'll mark 
A. kessleri on your tree of life. 

IN FORMING A SPECIES-GROUP NAME 
FROM THE NAME OF A WOMAN, A FINAL 
-A OR-E MAY BE ELIDED FOR EUPHONY, 
E.G., JOSEPHINEAE OR JOSEPHINAE 
(JOSEPHINE). 

I have set out to have a species 
named after me, to be memorialized 
by a zoological specimen. In the last 
two hundred years, about 1.8 million 
species have been named; and yet, still 
millions more await classification. Most 
such creatures will be stuck with banal 
titles, Latin words describing where 
they were found or what they look like. 
Some fortunate creatures will instead 
be named after people. And soon, one 
particularly lucky young species will 
bear my name. 

The honor of becoming a zoological 
namesake has been bestowed upon 
all types of living individuals, even 
laboratory-fearing laypeople like myself. 
J email Dr. Eric Sargis, Yale Professor 
of Anthropology and curator at the 
Peabody Museum of Natural History, 
to inquire about the ro·ute to Linnaean 
permanence. He responds with a single 
sentence: "People name species after 
distinguished colleagues (see etymology 
for Dryomomys szalayi in-attached), not 
themselves:' 

IN FORMING A ZOOLOGICAL NAME 
FROM A COMPOUND PERSONAL NAME, 
A ZOOLOGIST SHOULD CONSIDER 
USING ONLY ONE OF THE COMPONENTS, 
GIVING PREFERENCE TO THE BETTER 
Since 2005, Wheeler 
has helped christen 
.beetles or George 
Bush (Agathidium 
· bushi), Darth Vader 
(Agathidium vaderi), 
and Stephen Colbert 
( Agaporomorphus 
colberti). 

KNOWN, E.G. BAKER! (BENTHUNE 
BAKER), GUERIN! (GUERIN MENIVILLE) 

I may not be a "distinguished colleague" 
but I'm pretty sure this campus holds 
a couple of the sort. Unwi11ing to give 
up my quest, I set out to find someone 
who has already achieved taxonomic 
recognition. 

Enter Carl Zimmer, Yale lecturer, 
famed science writer, and namesake of 
parasitic 
tapeworm 
Acanthobothrium 
zimmeri (the genus name is typically 
set, leaving only the species name up for 
grabs). "It's really nice;' says Zimmer. "It 
gives me a surprisingly warm feeling to 
know that there's a tapeworm out there 
that's got my name:' Zimmer's Linnaean 
legacy A. zimmeris name was officially 
published earlier this year was the 
gift of Carr!e Fyler, a student who was 
inspired to become a parasitologist by 
Zimmer's book Parasite Rex. When she 
set about the detailed and highlyformal 
process of naming shark parasites a few 
years later, Fyler figured shea return the 
favor to Zimmer. 

Ziiruner doesn't take his taxonomical 
fame for granted: "It's neat to know 
that you're in the books somewhere, 
even if it's a parasitology textbook or 
something:' As for my own entrance 
into the books, though, Zimmer offers 
minimal assistance. 
He does admit 
that even Linnaeus, the patriarch of 
taxonomy, had some fun with his names: 
''Apparently, when he would describe a 
really noxious weed he would sometimes 
name it after his enemies:' Zimmer also 
narrows my competition when he reveals 
that, as far he knows, egomaniacal 
taxonomists are not allowed to name 
species after themselves. I'm relieved 
by the his confession that he would 
have trouble identifying A. zimmeri 
from among a lineup of tapeworms. 

Zimmer also has to cope with every 
seasoned namesake's fear of, dare I say it, 
extinction. If A. zimmeri were to die out, 
Zimmer admits, "You know I would be 
very sa

Despite 
Zimmer's 
wisdom, 
he's 
unable to lead me far on my quest . . 
His tapeworm was a gift, and thus he 
has little counseJ to impart on how to
