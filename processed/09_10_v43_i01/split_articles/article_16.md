WALLER 
'09 INTERNED 
on 
Capitol Hill in the summer of 2006. 
His time there left him with little desire 
to return. Waller now lives in the capital 
and works for IBM. 
I've met him for lunch at Ben's Chili 
Bowl, a Washington landmark and 
guidebook destination. Ben's is noisy and 
crowded on a Saturday afternoon. There 
isn't room to stand on the restaurant's

booths are occupied. Large grills behind 
the counter are covered with roasting 
hot dogs.

Ben's is about twelve blocks away 
from the part of the city dominated 
by federal office buildings, and the 
atmosphere is different. A crowd of 
tourists and locals with their families has 
replaced the mix of government officials, 
political operatives, and wonky-looking 
economists that flood lunch spots 
downtown during the week. 

Waller contrasts the distribution of 
ages in Congress with the corporate· 
world. "We have a range of ages in the 
office, riot a gaggle of 17 -year-olds:' 
"The 
Hill is very young, very 
personality-driven, very partisan;' · he 
adds. The policy research congressional 
aides do can be fascinating, he admits, 
but "even when you are way down on the 
totem pole, as I was as an intern, you can 
sense the desire for power and (federal) 
money that many on the Hill have:'

Waller 
points out 
the 
black-and-white 
photographs 
decorating the walls, which show Ben, 
the restaurant's owner, with a number of 
civil rights leaders. Ben's, one of the few 
establishments to survive the race riots

that devastated this neighborhood in 
1968, is a local symbol of reconciliation.

Washington, even in this back room of 
Ben's, but it's different on Capitol Hill. As 
Waller puts it, "The Hill has· a crassness

Waller's colleagues there loved to talk 
about elections, which frustrated him. "I 
take great pride in being well-informed 
and I like knowing what's going on, but I 
don't feel the need to discuss a Montana 
primary race, being a D.C. resident and 
a Louisiana native. That's the kind of 
thing the Hill does;' he says. To Waller, 
Congress is as much about playing an 
intricate and high-stakes game as it is 
about creating a more perfect union. 

LLISON SEES IT DIFFERENTLY. Even a 
.veu-designed bill won't become law 
unless enough legislators vote for it, so 
it matters who and what has the support 
of the public and of key interest groups. 
"Politics and policy can't be separated. 
You need both to get anything done;' he 
says. 

Most congressional .offices have two 
components, he explains. Part of the staff 
focuses on legislative issues researching 
problems in society and designing laws 
to address them. But another part of the 
staff is dedicated to communications-
talking to constituents, representatives 
of interest groups, and other lawmakers. 
The intersection of politics and policy 
makes Congress intriguing for Ellison-
and it's why he wanted to work in the 
Majority Whip's office. Clyburn has a 
third group of staffers, the floor team, 
who are responsible for counting votes 
and making sure that bills the speaker 
brings before the House have enough 
support to pass. They have an important 
responsibility in the chamber, and 
. Ellison hopes to work with them in the 
future. 

Congress is not for everyone, Ellison 
concedes. "There are some people who 
had some connection to an office and got 
the internship, and this may be a good 
way for them to decide that politics is not 
what they want to do;' he says. 

Ellison, however, hopes to continue 
working here as long as the opportunity 
lasts. He will matriculate at Georgetown 
Law School in the fall of 2011 and take 
night classes there while continuing 
to work on Capitol Hill during the 
day. Hopefully he will have a position 
with more flexible hours by that time. 
Currently, Ellison works late, taking 
messages for the chief of staff, drafting 
emails to Democratic members of the 
House, or supervising the office's interns. 
Every Thursday morning he helps 
set up the whip's weekly breakfast for 
House Democrats. Clyburn's office also 
provides dinner for the caucus whenever 
the chamber holds an evening vote. The 
office orders take-out, and Ellison and 
his coworkers bring the food on carts up 
to a conference room where lawmakers 
can help themselves. 

For Ellison, even these small tasks are 
rewarding. "Everything we're doing has 
an impact on a huge number of people 
if we're doing our job right;' he says . 
"If we get the votes for something we 
support, then people's lives ·improve. If 
we don't get the votes, people's lives don't

Improve. 

IPPING A GIN AND TONIC in the 
Hawk and Dove, a Capitol Hill bar 
that serves congressional staffers of all 
stripes, Hu recalls the 2000 presidential 
election. On Election Night that year, his 
homework was to watch the news and 
color each state on a map of the United 
States red or blue as the newscasters 
announced results in favor of then 
Governor George Bush or then-Vice 
President AI Gore. 

Hu's relationship to politics in high 
school, however, was . "kind of like 
cheering for a sports team, an undying 
faith in the Democrats or liberalism:' 
None of his friends were interested in 
politics or read the news regularly. Hu 
began to develop his political views 
seriously only when he joined the Yale 
Political Union. He became interested in 
social justice, an issue for which Chu has 
a record as a firm advocate. 

Now, Hu has a place at the source 
of decisions on social justice but his 
experience working on Capitol Hill has 
made him less idealistic. "It's made me 
appreciate the complexity of the political 
process a lot more;' he explains. 'Ihings 
are no longer so black and white, or red 
and blue, as the case may be.
