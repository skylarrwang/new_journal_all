Say Cheese 
INSIDE THE CHEESE TRUCK, I AM 
sweating like a wedge of parmesan 
- it's just a quarter past twelve, but 
already, a lin:e has formed outside. 
Caseus, the three-year-old bistro 
and fromagerie at 93 Whitney Av-
enue, officially owns the vehicle, but 
Jeff, a Caseus chef and self-identi-
fied "cheese truck dude;' calls it his 
"current babY:' Jeff's helpers today 
are Krystle, whose favorite topping 
is guacamole, a new trainee named 
Raven, and me. 
The four of us are packed so tight-
ly· that _only I can reach the fridge, 
so they· let me serve Perrier, Coke, 
and Di~t Coke to customers. Krys-
•• 
tle explains that the soda in glass 
bottles, made with real sugar, not 
corn syrup comes from Mexico. 
The sandwich du juor is a grass-fed 
beef patty, and today's tomatoes hail 
from a farm in Washington, Con-
necticut. "I know the farmer;' -says 
Jeff, who likes his ingredients to be 
as local as possible. 
Besides four people and a fridge, 
the small van contains a grill (Jeff's 
hands deftly feel out the hottest 
zones), a vat of tomato soup, a stack 
of sliced sourdough, coolers of veg-
etables, a prep surface for salad, and 
a big box of grated cheese: comte, 
cheddar, swiss, gruyere, gouda, and 
provolone. The walls are clean, shiny 
metal, and the skylight is propped 
open. Caseus found this specially 
outfitted vehicle through a Craigslist 
post from New Jersey. 
When business is slow, custom-
ers take time to chat, usually to ex-
SEPTEMBER 2010 
press happiness at stumbling upon 
the truck: "I was just walking by 
and I was like, wait, Caseus truck! 
Awesome:' When the line grows 
long, Krystle begins to yell orders-
"Tomato!" to Jeff, who stands just 
two feet from her and confirms, 
"Tomato!" 
"The challenge of trying to hustle 
sandwiches as fast as possible"-
Krystle pauses to confess 
"is a lot 
of fun:' 
Within minutes of each other, 
two young men ask us about The 
Challenge. To rise to The Challenge, 
customers must design a sandwich 
and down ten within an hour. Sur-
vivors win a t -shirt, naming rights, 
and free sandwiches for life. "If you 
don't make it;' the truck's menu cau-
tions, "you must pay in full and you 
get nothing but full of cheese sand-
wiches:' 
"Does it say without vomiting?" 
asks one curious customer. (It does . .) 
"Don't come overly hungry;' Ra-
ven warns. "Your stomach shrinks:' 
Another customer asks whether it 
is enough to add just one topping 
to the sandwich. "Yeah;' shouts Jeff 
from the grill, "but you don't want to 
be that arugula guy:' 
The man who came closest to 
meeting the challenge inhaled seven 
guacamole and onion cheese sand-
wiches before throwing in the nap-
kin. Only one other person has at-
tempted, and he topped out at only 
four. Will anyone ever succeed? "I 
hope so:' says Jeff. "SQmebody has

Caseus owner Jason Sobochinski 
and his brother, Tommy introduced 
the cheese truck in February. The 
truck brings publicity to the restau-
rant, but Jeff describes its main mis-
sion as bringing sandwiches to the 
masses. "Everybody;' he says, "loves 
grilled cheese. I see people s1nile be-
cause they eat grilled cheese .. That 
makes me happy:' 
Many Yalies are familiar with the 
truck's Tuesday and Friday visits to 
York Street and its Wednesdays on 
Cross Campus. Other regular stops 
include Yale-New Haven Hospital on 
Thursdays and the Wooster Square 
Farmers' Market on Saturdays. The 
truck also made an appearance at 
. the September 1Oth Train concert in 
Trumbull, Connecticut. "It's the first 
concert we've done;' Jeff says. That 
same weekend, the truck served cus-
tomers at the Fall Festival and Green 
Expo in Edgerton Park. 
The cheese truck may be going 
places, but its heart will always re-
main a good grilled cheese sand-
wich. I ask Jeff for tips. "The trick 
is butter;' he replies, dipping a ladle 
. into a Tupperware container and 
splashing it on the grill. One ounce 
per sandwich. "Let the bread swim 
in the butter:' Then, add cheese, 
''squish it together;' and fry. Perfect, 
every time.
