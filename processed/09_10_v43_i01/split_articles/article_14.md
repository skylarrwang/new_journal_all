**Yale Students on Capitol Hill**

HE WEEK OF JULY 4, Congress is 
in recess. The cafeteria's patrons, 
lining up with trays of food at the 
row of checkout counters, are dressed 
casually in polo shirts, tank tops, and 
khaki pants-no neckties. The cafeteria 
is in the basement of the Longworth 
House 
Office 
Building on Capitol 
Hill, one of several granite and marble 
blocks clustered around the Capitol 
in Washington, D.C., where members 
of Congress and their staff have their 
offices. 

The mood is lighthearted, almost 
merry. Press assistants trade jokes across 
the salad bar, and interns waiting in line 
for the grill talk about the menu. You 
wouldn't know that partisan acrimony is 
especially intense right now, but midterm 
elections are just three months away-
eating here are two opposed camps. By 
the way they gossip over bagels, you 
might forget that these people spend 
their days butting heads. By the way they 
talk over their coffee, you might forget 
that their bosses' decisions can affect 
millions of people. 

In fact, you might think for a 
moment that you're in a cafeteria at 
a large university. Most of the several 
thousand staffers running the day-to-
day operations of the nation's legislatl,lre 
are under thirty. They are recent 
college grads, off to research for their 
senator. They are high-school interns 
and undergrads, off to sort papers in 
exchange for just being here in this place. 
A few of the bunch will rise quickly to 
take on responsibility and influence. 
One or two of them will be leading our 
country twenty years down the road. But 
for now, they're running the show from 
behind the scenes. Capitol Hill has a 
culture of youth, ambition, and idealism, 
and it is the source of federal law in the 
United States. 

NE OF THE CAFETERIA'S PATRONS 
today is Matthew Ellison '1 0, a 
newly-nlinted staff assistant in the 
office of Rep. Jim Clyburn, the Majority 
Whip and third-ranking Democrat in 
the House of Representatives. He is 
one of about twenty-five current Yale 
students and recent graduates working 
for members of Congress in Washington 
this sununer. 

"I love the Hill;' Ellison tells me. 
Like many others who seek jobs in 
Washington, Ellison moved to the capital 
after graduation without knowing where 
he would work. Graduates entering 
other fields may be able to line up a 
job in January of their senior year, but 
vacancies in politics need to be filled 
quickly, he explained. Most people have 
to be in the District before they can have 
a chance of finding a position. 

Ellison knew when he arrived in 
Washington that he wanted to work for 
Clyburn, a powerful legislator from his 
home state of South Carolina, and was 
able to meet with the chief of staff for 
Rep. John Spratt, who also represents 
South Carolina, through a friend of 
the family. Spratt's chief of staff was 
impressed enough to put Ellison in touch 
with her counterpart in Clyburn's office, 
who got him a position. 

Ellison started as an intern, working 
without pay, a few weeks before I met 
him. When one of the staff assistants 
left, Ellison stepped in to fill the role. I 
met him during his first week in this new 
capacity. 

This summer wasn't the first time 
Ellison had been inside an influential 
lawmaker's office; 
In 
the summer 
before his freshman year at Yale, Ellison 
interned under then-senator Joseph 
Biden from Delaware. 

As Ellison tells the story, his geometry 
teacher's band 
was 
performing at 
an event that Biden happened to be 
attending. Ellison-in what would later 
become a wise political move-came 
along too, and introduced himself. After 
the show, Biden spoke with the members 
of the band, and the geometry teacher 
let it slip that Ellison would be attending 
Yale in the fall. The senator decided there 
was room for this student in his office. 
By the end of that first summer, Ellison 
was hooked. "The Hill is where all the 
action is;' he says. It's where lawmakers 
and their aides are creating national 
policy, and there are opportunities even 
for a junior staff member to make the 
country a better place. He worked at 
a federal agency last summer but was 
frustrated by the bureaucracy there. He 
says there's less red tape in Congress, 
which answers only to voters. 

HE FIRST TIME KEVIN Hu '11 walked 
into 
the 
Longworth 
building's 
basement cafeteria, he recalls seeing 
Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts 
Democrat with thirty years experience, 
just sitting at a table there, with his jacket 
off and his shirt un-tucked. "It's always 
shocking;' Hu says of sightings like these. 
Unlike Ellison, however, Hu and most 
of the other Yalies working on the Hill 
I talked to got their positions through 
the front door, by applying online or 
submitting a resume and cover letter. 
One of Hu's fellow interns, however, 
is the congresswoman's nephew. It is 
not unusual for one of the interns in a 
congressional office to be a relative of 
the legislator, especially since the tasks 
interns complete don't require much 
expertise. Interns, according to Hu, are 
"the moat that separates the staffers from 
everyone else:' They take calls, respo~d to 
letters from constituents, and give tours 
of the Capitol. They're also given tedious 
research assignments. Hu recently was 
tasked with fact-checking hours of 
testimony from Supreme Court Justice 
Elena Kagan's confirmation hearings in 
the Senate. 

But there are other assignments that 
make interning worth it. Emily Villano 
'13 says her interest in the legislative 
process led her to apply for an internship 
with Rep. Greg Walden, who represents 
her home district in Oregon. The 
internship allowed her to listen in on 
briefings and hearings and to see how 
a congressional office operates from the 
inside. 

Villano 
recalls 
one 
memorable 
hearing on the controversial Arizona 
law aimed at reducing undocumented 
immigration. The witnesses, all women, 
testified on how the law would impact 
their lives. They spoke of the abuse they 
had suffered at the hands of deputies and 
the trauma of children whose mothers 
were detained. Some listening were 
moved to tears. (The law is currently 
suppressed under a court injunction.) 

Experiences like this made Villano's 
time on Capitol Hill worthwhile, despite 
other, less glamorous assignments she 
received. She recalls days spent entering 
names into a database. "That would 
just be mind-nuil}bingly boring," she 
remembers. "I felt like I was wasting my
