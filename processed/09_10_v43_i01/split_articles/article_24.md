IN FORMING A SPECIES-GROUP NAME 
) 
FROM YOUR OWN NAME YOU LL NEED 
A FRIEND. THAT FRIEND SHOULD BE 
A SKILLED IN THE RESEARCH OF TINY 
CREATURES, E.G. AN ENTOMOLOGIST OR 
"· 
PARASITOLOGIST. 

I 
need-· ~ to make some friends. I 
summon all my charm and cunning, and 
• 
I proceed. I must not solicit someone 
who's already achieved nomenclatural 
triumph but instead find someone who 
baptizes creatures himself. I try for 
Quentin Wheeler, Vice President and 
Dean at Arizona State University. And -
insect taxonomist extraordinaire. 

Wheeler is 
famous 
for leading 
celebrities into the taxonomic world, 
much to the chagrin of his more 
straight -laced colleagues. His retort 
is that he works in an underfunded, 
unnoticed field: "Why not spin it in such 
a way so that it brings media attention 
to the whole effort?" 

Hence, since 
2005, he's helped christen beetles for 
George Bush (Agathidium bushi), Darth . 
Vader (Agathidium vaderi), and Stephen 
Colbert 
(Agaporomorphus 
colberti), 
among many others. 

"President Bush phoned me up to 
thank me for the honor of having a · 
species named after him-that was a 
thrill-and actually followed up with a 
little handwritten note. And, I daresay-
SEPTEMBER 2010 
. 

these were slime-mold feeding beetles 
-so I like to say that this is probably the 
only time in the history of the Union 
that the word 'slime-mold' was penned 
in the Oval Office;' Wheeler proudly 
announces. 

I don't see why Bush and Colbert, 
whose names will be memorialized 
regardless 
of their 
entrance 
into 
zoological 
taxonomy, 
need species 
when so many of us underdogs want 
to be remembered. I'm also resentful of 
Wheeler's nonchalant comment that he's 
got around four or six species named 
after him. He has stopped keeping track. 

Zimmer also has to cope 
with 
every 
seasoned 
namesakes 
ear o > dare 
I say it> extinction . .l A. 
zimmeri were to die out> 
Zimmer admits> 
ccYou 
know I would be very sad. n 

He doesn't fail, though, to rub it in: "You 
know it's your little piece of immortality:' 

Yours if you can get it, Wheeler. 

But as would any noble crusader, I 
lay aside my jealousy and frustration 
and concentrate on the task at hand: 
persuade this patronymic patriarch to 
put zarae in the books. After 15 minutes 
on the phone, I finally pop the question 
to Wheeler: Let's just say I wanted to 
name a species after myself. How would 
I do it? 

"Do you have a checkbook handy?" 
he laughs. I'm on board, reaching into 
my pocket. Sure I'll pay twenty, even 
fifty, dollars for immortality. Sign me up. 
I'll give up Starbucks for a few weeks. 
Welcome to the world young T. zarae. 

"You know it's funny, I led a 
fundraising tour cruise to the Galapagos 
this spring. And one of the guests along 
on the yacht told rne and I haven't done 
it yet but I'm going to follow through-
she said she would gladly pay $5,000 to 
have a species named after her;' Wheeler 
explains. ·~nd I told her as soon as I 
found one elegant enough I'd be back:' 

Maybe I'll have to give up Starbucks for 
life . 

Or maybe I'll just have to give up. 

But Wheeler admits, though his price is 
high, he's not my only hope. Anyone who 
describes a species, follows the rules laid 
.. out by the International Commission on 
Zoological Nomenclature, and publishes · 
his work in the appropriate place, can 
be a taxonomist. "So frankly the only 
gatekeeper is that individual. Someone 
might do it for a pint of good beer, I 
don't know, it's entirely up to them:' 

If only I could find that person, l(:l be 
happy to provide him with several pints. 
Then again, marrying Wheeler might be 
a cheaper option. "I named one species 
after my wife and another one after my 
ex-wife!" he laughs. "So there's all kinds 
of possibility:• 

"So my best bet is to befriend 
someone who finds species often?" 

"Yes, absolutely the best way to go!" 

But Dean Wheeler, I want to plead, I 
was hoping you could be that friend. "Keep 
me in mind if you're naming any new 
species!" I make a last pathetic stab. 

"Will do. Absolutely." Wheeler's reply 
seems less than sincere. 

IN FORMING A ZOOLOGICAL NAME 
FROM YOUR OWN PERSONAL NAME, YOU 
NEED SOME CASH. A FEW HUNDRED 
THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULD BE 
HELPFUL, THOUGH YOU MAY BE ABLE 
TO GET BY WITH ONLY A COUPLE OF 
THOUSANDS.


---

Perhaps trying to avoid becoming my 
taxonomic sponsor, Wheeler later emails 
me a set of hyperlinks, which usher me 
• to my· next destination: organizations 
that formally sell species. 

First, there's a stop in Germany, 
which boasts BIOPAT (Patrons for 
Biodiversity), a nonprofit group founded 
in 1999. "Name a frog or an orchid!" 
flashes across my computer screen as I 
~rrive at the BIOPAT website. "Names 
are meaningless?' Not at all since a name 
identifies individuals:' it clarifies. "With 
a ~ingle donation of at least 2.600 Euro to 
BIOPAT e.V. you can eternalize a name 
of your choice by baptizing a newly 
discovered plant or animal species:' 

Despite this homepage, Dr. Jorn 
· Kohler, a zoologist at the National 
Hessian Museum, insists that BIOPAT 
isn't really selling anything: "It's a honor 
for support of nature conservation and 
biodiversity research via · a donation 
(acquiring funds for these fields is 
the major aim of BIOPAT):' But, as I 
browse the site's catalogue of species, 
it's crystal clear that for 2.600 Euro, the 
beetle, Penthoscarpha zarae, can be mine. 
Upgrade to 3.500 Euro, and I can instead 
christen, Milichiella zarae, a fifteen to 
twenty million-year-old fly species. A 
· Google currency converter computes 
that the cheaper beetle will cost me 
$3,843. Thanks, but no thanks. 

Hoping 
that 
Europeans 
attach 
a higher value to taxonomy than 
Americans do, I travel closer to home 
seeking a better deal. San Diego holds 
the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 
a 
Name-a-Species 
program 
and a website asserting, "Every year 
collections staff and researchers discover 
new species of marine creatures. The 
cost to name one of Scripps's newly 
discovered species ranges from $5,000 
to $100,000:' I start to hope that with· 
a phone call to Greg Rouse, curator of 
the Benthic Invertebrate Collection at 
the Institution, something cheaper can 
be arranged for an enthusiastic Linneaus 
fan. 

Not exactly. Rouse explains to me 
that when he finds a new species, if it 
seems suitable, he turns it over to. the 
development office: "What we normally 
want is something that looks pretty good, 
that we have a good photograph of:' If no 



A slime beetle (shown above) was named after President Bush by scientist Quentin Wheeler. 
one purchases the species, Rouse doesn't 
delay the publication of his scientific 
paper nor does he lower the price to 
increase demand (apparently he's not 
in contact with the Scripps Economics 
department). Instead, he names the 
species himself. Since the Scripps project 
began in 2008, only one $10,000 worm 
and three $5,000 species have been sold. 
Rouse doesn't see the pricing scheme as a 
problem. The problem, he gripes, is that 
he underwater invertebrates, "People 
are mainly attracted to vertebrates. It's 
difficult to sell a worm:' When I press 
him to expound on the exorbitant 
pricing, hoping he'll offer me a discount 
for my valiant efforts, he only grows 
perturbed. "It costs a lot of money for us 
to name the species. It takes a lot of time 
and a lot of effort:' 

Apparently, finding an economical 
means 
of 
achieving 
taxonomical 
permanence also takes a lot time and 
effort, and I'm growing tired: Perhaps 
sensing my impatience, Rouse explains 
that, in the past, people have come to 
him, explaining their desire to name 
a species and support the project-but 
without the requisite 5,000-plus dollars. 
He soothes them by telling them not 
to fret but instead to start saving. With 
millions of species to name, a worm will 
be waiting when you can cough up the 
cash. 

But I've no patience for starting a 
piggy bank. Wapting my species and 
wanting her now, I'm contemplating 
· backtracking to bargain with Wheeler. 
THE NEw JouRNAL 



"Name 
orchid!" 
og or an 
ashes across my 
computerscreen as I arrive 
at the BIOPAT website. 
onto the aptly-titled Nameaspecies.com, 
the brainchild of 24-year-old Hunter 
Williams. 

When 
the 
website 
loads, 
immediately see her. A charming tan-
colored midge. For $500 she's mine. For 
$500, I can have Telmatogeton zarae, a 
two-winged fly from Iceland. She's not 
pretty, enchanting, or particularly exotic. 
She also doesn't cost the fifty dollars I set 
out to spend. But I have four months 
until Chanukah. Just enough time to 
convince my parents that all I want for 
the holidays is to be memorialized by 
taxonomic offspring. 

While completing a Master's Degree 
at 
Cambridge 
University, 
Williams 
became fascinated by the fact that his 
-
friend, a .paleobiology PhD student, had 
the chance to name some species. But 
Williams never garnered a namesake 
for himself, he laments, because his pal 
soon switched fields. Williams realized 
that graduate students, always in need 
of a little extra cash, name many of the 
world's newest species and got the idea 
to launch a site to sell more affordable 
species names. "I thought- there was 
a real opportunity for a retail way for 
average people to be participating and 
supporting science;' Williams says. 

Finally, someone has heard my wallet's 
cnes. 

"I wound up;' he continues, "only 
being able 
to find 
one scientist, 
Norwegian 
entomologist:' 

The 
Norwegian handed over information 
about a handful of insects he needed to 
name in his next paper, and Williams 
agreed that he would give him a sizeable 
portion of the proceeds, which due to 
William's focus on accessibility and 
the species' lackluster natures, would 
be meager: "I didn't-think people were 
going to be willing to spend more than 
' 

a few hundred dollars for a microbe or. 
a midge:' Nameaspecies.com launched 
in August 2008, to the delight of bargain 
species-shoppers like myself. 


But the fate of young T. . zarae is 
less delightful. Midway thrbugh our 
conversation, Williams admits that none 
of the initial species up for sale sold, 
perhaps due their lack of "sexiness:' 

Had I clicked Telmatogeton, I would have 
found that she's been removed from the 
website's inventory. In Jact, none of the 
website's species are up for sale any more. 
The Norwegian scientist published his 
paper; the nameless flies were baptized. 
Williams is now a strategy consultant 
in Shanghai, lamenting the pending 
extinction of his website: "It's a concept 
that is currently in mothballs:' Goodbye 
T. kesslerae. Good thing I hadn't ordered 
the personalized stationery yet. 


So what, Mr. Williams, should a 
weary traveler with a college student's 
budget do about her aspirations for 
taxonomic immortality? 

"Meet some grad students who are 
in the right kinds of fields and get to be·· 
their girlfriends - that may be a pretty 
good waY:' 

A NEW GENUS 
OR SPECIES-GROUP 
NAME 
IS ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO 
ACQUIRE FOR ONESELF CHEAPLY. 

I'm ready to log onto Facebook 
to scrutinize the profiles of graduate 
students 
in 
paleobiology 
and 
entomology. And then an email brings 
me within sight of the promised land, 
swarming with bugs and beetles. It's 
the messianic Hunter Williams, hailing 
from Shanghai. He wonders if I want 
to be put in contact with Iiis friend the 
Norwegian entomologist. "If you would 
like a species named after you and do 
not mind that it is a midge, he might be 
willing to oblige:' 

Yes 
please, 
pretty 
contact 
the Norwegian. I reply immediately. 

After weeks of anxious waiting and 
number of insistent reminders, 
Williams finally fulfi11s his promise. 
Apologizing for his tardiness (he's been 
busy at his real job), Williams copies 
me on an email to the one-and -only 
Professor Saether, requesting that the 
Norwegian entomologist speak with me. 

Microscopic bugs and parasites again fly 
through my daily thoughts. But pleading 
emails from Williams and from myself, 
remain unanswered by the Norwegian; 
perhaps Saether deems neither of us his 
"distinguished colleagues:' 

I've been on the road towards 
taxonomic permanence for over two 
months, and I don't feel any closer to 
the zoological Holy ·Grail than when 
I began. Late one November evening, 
I send Saether one last beseeching 
email, for closure more than anything 
else. Then I purge all memories of the 
Norwegian and his midges. 

I wake up the next morning to find 
Saether's name in my e-mailbox and 
curse my rash actions of the previous 
night. What kind of crusader gives up on 
a quest? When did I lose my zoological 
zeal? My heart beats as I open up what 
just may be my acceptance letter into the 
world of taxonomy. 

"I did not answer you previously 
since I was quite busy and I did not 
have anything to say except the whole 
business seems to have been a failure;' · 
Saether's message opens. I pray that the 
next sentence reads Nevertheless would 
you prefer to bestow your name on a midge 
from Iceland or would one from an island 
in the South Atlantic better suit your tastes? 

It does not. Instead, the Norwegian 
entomologist launches into his own sad 
tale. A couple of years ago, he officially 
bid adieu to the world of science, and, 
in his retirement, lost his funding. 

Post-retirement and still christening 
little bugs, Saether hesitantly entered 
the world of species selling as a way 
of amassing money for his work. But 
when no one wanted to buy his midges, 
he baptized them himself. Changing 
their names now would be an arduous 
process. 

Saether makes no offers to name a 
species after me and, in fact, he seems 
to be contemplating withdraw! from 
commercial taxonomy all together. 

When I close my laptop, there is only 
one word of his email that lingers in my 
rnind: retirement. 

A 
NEW 
GENUS 
OR 
SPECIES-GROUP 
NAME IS NOT ALL THAT IS OUT THERE. 

To save the day, I turn to Bond. Jason
