cally, is the closest many of these chil-
dren will come to a normal childhood. 
"Rau1on has witnessed staff hurting 
children by bending their arms and 
legs until they cry, slamming them on 
the floor, and dragging them across 
the rug." 

Fitzgerald knows that most kids come 
to the Center fearful. "Their only glimps-
es of detention come from shows like 
Lockup Raw;· he says. In the 1990s, those 
fea.t;'s would have been justified. Perhaps 
nowhere are the changes in the New Ha-
ven Center as noticeable as in the use 
of discipline. Until Emily ] brought the 
practices to the attention of the courts, 
• the line staff in the Center were beating 
children as young as eight years old on a 
regular basis. "We used to restrain kids 
using very barbaric and crude meth-
ods;' recalls Joe Mirto. Training was 
purely physical: karate, jujitsu, submis-
sion holds. Mirto remembers working 
an overnight shift and being taken by the 
local FBI into a back classroom around 
three in the morning. "They taught us 
how to kick, punch, how to hit with the 
heel of our hand:' At the time, it was 
standard operating procedure. "We used 
to use something called an arm bar a lot. 
That's when ·you lift a child's arm behind 
his back, whichever arm you want, as far 
as you can go without breaking it:' 

Room confinement was the other 
major form of discipline before Emily J 
"If a kid swore at you in 1991, he or she 
was probably given 'room time;" says 
Mirto. «We'd use a method of punish-: 
ment called stacking. If you were a kid, 
and you told me to go reproduce myself, 
you got 24 hours of room confinement. If 
you told me to fuck off when I gave you 
room time, you'd get another 24 hours 
stacked on the first 24 for basically the 
same offense:' 

Staff in the 1990s resorted to violence 
and room time because they were not 
trained on how to treat the children as 
anything but criminals. "If the only thing 
a carpenter had was a hammer and nail;' 
explains Karl Alston, now deputy direc-
tor of juvenile residential services for 
CSSD, «that's all he would use. But if he 
had a full toolbag- his router, his screw-
driver, the hammer and nail, a saw - he'd 
be more productive. That's how we look 
at our staff. The more we give them tools 
to use, the better our environments will 
b ,,
e. 

Both Mirto and Fitzgerald are quick 
to point out that the Center how strives 
to minimize room time and physical 
submission. When Fitzgerald came to 
the facility as superintendent in 1999, he 
started by retraining the staff. "In reality, 
the JDOs are closer to your parent than 
your prison guard;' he says. "They need-
ed to start thinking that way, in order for 
the kids to start thinking that waY:' 

· Training is no longer on how to hit 
a child effectively. It was imperative· to 
Fitzgerald that staff be tra~ned "not tore-
act, but to interact. We spent more time 
on interaction, communication, avoid-
ing conflict. When they learned those 
concepts, it transformed the facility:' 

The job of a juvenile detention officer 
can lend itself to power trips, and some 
still have their moments, says Mirto. 
"Some staff think they're officers. We're 
not really officers. I'm a caretaker. I take 
care of your ld.ds:' 

Most of the boys who come through 
the Center have no positive male figure 
in their lives. It is paramount to Mirto, 
he says, that he act as a role model, not 
another disappointment. He is known 
throughout the Center for his hesitance 
to lay a }:land on a child. "Regardless of 
what your child may have done - mur-
der, rape, not going to school - I take 
care of your child. Do I get mad? Of 
course I do. Do I abuse them? No waY:' 

S FITZGERALD POINTS out often, the 
New Haven Center's dual accredita-
tion by the American Correctional Asso-
ciation and the National Commission on 
Correctional Health Care place it among 
the best in the nation. In his office, the 
certificates from the first time New Ha-
ven was accredited in 2003 hang behind 
his desk, so that guests who sit and face 
him cannot help but notice. 

His voice swells with pride when he 
talks about working on that first accredi-
tation. "When I was preparing for ACA, 
I called fifty facilities in the country that 
had been through the process to really 
learn how it was done and what we had 
to do:' Like many of those facilities, New 
Haven was motivated by a court order 
to make changes to the facility. But un-
like most, the Center, under Fitzgerald's 
leadership, decided to try for regular 
reaccreditation every three years. "We 
want to continually test ourselves against 
the national waters, to ensure that we are 
continually at the forefront of juvenile 
detention:' 

The accrediting organizations look for 
excellence in all of the areas where the 
Emily ] consent decree ordered change: 
living conditions, medical and mental 
health care, recreation, education, disci-
pline. And by those organizations' stan-
dards, thanks to the hard work of people 
like Jack Fitzgerald and to the empathy 
of people like Joe Mirto, the New Haven 
Center is nearly perfect. 

But what does it mean to be the per-
fect juvenile detention center? 
What 
does it mean to be the best of all the fu-
tures that parents fear for theit children: 
the best of all the places no one wants to 
'· 
end up? 

Group therapy and real classrooms 
and African drums can go a long way 
towards making a child forget that the 
rest of the world sees him as a criminal. 
But when beds made of plastic and not 
metal are a victory, when strip searches 
are routine and when privacy is an unre-
alistic wish - through no fault of Fitzger-
ald's, or Mirto's, or maybe anyone's at all 
- the shadow of being in an institution 
will always preclude some light from 
shining through. 

Nonetheless, it is important work to 
try to give children their youth back. And 
the detainees that Fitzgerald and Mirto 
care for are just that: children. They are 
young, and have been taught badly by 
the people and places where they grew 
up. Thanks to Emily ], the staff in the 
New Haven Center understand that it is 
someone's duty not only to teach these 
children but to teach them well. You are 
worth teaching, Fitzgerald seems to say.
