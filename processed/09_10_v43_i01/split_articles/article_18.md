EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
He used to think he<i be the new-age Jor-
dan. But then he came to his senses. He 
realized that his dream team "The Se-
cret" would never be and that the NBA 
wouldn't be calling. So after years of per-
fecting his made-up moves, Ike called it 
quits. It was time for him to come back 
to the real world. Now, Ike only plays 
for fun. At lunch he can be seen play-
ing taps with Mercedes, another one of 
his students. People say that she sleeps a 
lot, but if you put a basketball in front of 
her, she becomes wide-eyed and bushy-
tailed. But enough about her. 

Mr. Wilson is a sneaker freak. When 
asked how many pairs of sneakers he 
has, he obnoxiously replied, "I have like 
somewhere around 40 pairs. Sometimes 
I Nike ID them, but most of the time I 
buy them as is:Â· 

Ike is obsessed with his name. On 
his Nike ID'd sneakers the "N" is in one 
color and the "IKE" is in another. If you 
haven't noticed, he highlights the part 
of Nike that is his name. If you take the 
"N" off of "Nike': what do you get? IKE! 
Ike Wilson, that's his name, and playing 
basketball is his game. 

But as of right now, Ike isn't play-
ing ball He's playing with his black 
and yellow pen. It sort of looks like a 
bumblebee. Now he's looking at some 
black and white "Thank You" cards that 
sit on a very manly hot pink file orga-
nizer thingy. Now Ike seals the envelope 
with a lick of his tongue. Ewwwww! Get 
some tape, man. 

Mr. Wilson is a rising senior at Yale 
University. I don't think he has a girl-
friend. He's never texting and doesn't 
have any pictures in his wallet. He also 
mopes around all day like he doesn't 
have a care in the world. Ladies, there's 
a single man on the loose. For all you 
cougars out there, Mr. Wilson is lonely. 

Mr. Wilson has an odd-looking piece 
of hair that sticks off the top of his head. 
It looks like this Greaser needs a hair-
cut! Maybe Mr. Tern us can hook him up 
with a fade and a fresh edge. 

Mr. Wilson loves to hit the books. 
He hasn't gotten more than five hours 
of sleep in eight years. No wonder he's 
always so grumpy. Or at least that's what 
he says about how many hours of sleep 
he gets. 

Ike loves to visit his family. Sadly, his 
mother and brother were in a car acci-
dent recently. The car flipped over four 
times! Luckily no one was hurt. 

Ike is from California. He lives in San 
Francisco. Yeah, I was disappointed too. 
I thought he lived in Hollywood. But 
what man in his right mind would leave 
HOLLYWOOD and come here, all the 
way across the country to New Haven, 
Connecticut?! 

Mr. Wilson has his own style. Some-
times his skinnies have a few wrinkles. 
That just makes me wonder what his 
room looks like. I'm going to just take 
a guess. 

No man who gets just under five 
hours of sleep has time to keep a neat, 
clean room. I get nine hours of sleep 
and my room's still a mess. 

According to Ike, his childhood Nerf 
goal is on the back of his dormitory door 
facing the big common room. He says 
his dorm consists mostly of a desk and 
bed, so where does he store his clothes? 
There has to be someplace he stores all 
those old-man loafers. And what about 
those pants? He has to have at least five 
pairs: two blue, two khaki and a black. 
Then there are all those shirts. On July 
13th, Ike was wearing a blue, grey, and 
white striped polo with his blue skinny-
legged jeans. And last but not least, he 
was wearing his navy blue old-man loaf-
ers. Now, that outfit deserves to be on 
the cover of a magazine. NOT! 

Today, Ike edits more work. He could 
really use a break. Maybe while he's on 
that break he could brush up on those 
handwriting skills. I mean, he writes 
like my doctor in that yet-to-be famous 
chicken scratch. 

But there are some things that Ike is 
good at. like basketball and teaching. If 
he puts those skills together he could be 
a basketball coach. It's a very doable job. 
My Social Studies teacher, Mr. Civ, does 
it and he works full time. Coaching bas-
ketball is just his side hustle. 

On a regular basis, Ike is a pretty cool 
dude. Although he is often tired, he gets 
his work done. Ike is dedicated and that 
is why he's # 1. That is why I like IKE.
