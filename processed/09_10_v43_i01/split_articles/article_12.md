HE CLASS 
OF 
2014 effectively 
shares a birthday with the Inter-
net. Netscape Navigator, the first 
major lnternet browser, was released 
·for public consumption in 1992. The 
newest Yalies were still growing teeth 
while Netscape and Yahoo were grow-
ing roots, and by their first high school 
term in 2006, 57 million households in 
the U.S. were already broadband sub-
scribers. That number has since grown 
to over 81 million, according to 2009 
statistics from the OECD, which tracks 
Internet ~sage in 33 countries.

Brainpower, 
revved up 
by signal strength. That's 
the 
core 
idea 
behind 
Yale's many tech exertions 
and 
expenses~-that the 
Internet 
can 
improve 
what was already good to 
begin with. 
A Yale student computing survey 
conducted in 2007 by Information Tech-
nology Services (ITS) revealed that 80 
percent of students were using the Uni-
versity wireless network that year, com-
pared with just 20 percent in 2003. 2007 
also marked the first year the university 
took interest in students' online activity, 
asking about their Facebook use (78 per-
cent were members then), their online 
music purchases (56.5 percent had pa-
tronized iTunes). Nationwide, trends are 
sitnilar. An exhaustive report published 
SEPTEMBER 2010 
last year by EDUCAUSE, a nonprofit 
association devoted to IT initiatives in 
higher learning, found that 90 percent 
of the 29,000 students at American and 
Canadian universities surveyed used so-
cial networking sites every day, and "84 
percent were downloading music or vid-
eos on a weekly basis. 


Like the printing press before it, the 
Web marks an epistemological turning 
point: a moment when what we know· 
and how we know are critically ex-
panded and transformed. While univer-
sity authorities might once have taken 
a tongue-in-cheek or turn-the-other-
cheek approach to today's prevailing 
fads, they're now following them closely, 
because the what and how of knowledge 
are the basis of their careers. How should 
a university react when the mental pro-
cessing of its students is fundamentally 
altered, at times even replaced, by com-
puter processing? How, and what, does 
one teach this new generation of savvy 
undergraduates? 


URING THE 2009-20"10 academic 
year, the Yale College Programs of 
Study offered 15 undergraduate courses 
that featured web-related topics. 
But 
these classes are anomalies among a 
mostly Internet-free curriculum. How-
ever, the Internet has significantly 
changed the ways in which Yalies expe-
rience their education. 


Online scholastic resources are ubiq-
uitous. The Classes*v2 server is the 
most familiar, hosting some 1500 un-
dergraduate and graduate courses each 
semester. Of the $115 million spent each 
year on Information Technology (IT), 
roughly $5.5 million goes to tec4nologi-
cal resources in teaching and learning, 
which covers everything from installing 
and distributing clickers in large-lecture 
. 
' 
courses to creating downloadable virtual 
art museums for the Art History depart-
nient.

Chuck Powell, the Senior Director 
of Academic Media and Technology a 
subdivision of ITS has observed mark-
edly positive trends in digital education 
on campus. "The bar keeps rising ev-
ery year;' he says. "Four years ago, the 
percentage of faculty who wen~ ; using 
installed projectors to display media or 
PowerPoint in the classroom was prob-
ably around ten to twenty percent. These 
days, we count it at around sixty, sixty-
five percent:' 


Many of these faculty members, in-
cluding tenured professors and the occa-
sional Luddite Emeritus, have sought to 
push the envelope further than Power-
Point. One famously taught Beowulf 2.0, 
using student wikis to promote ·arid ex-; 
pand conversation about the epic poem. 
Another used 3D and geo-technology 
to enhance the study of ancient Rome, 
making artifacts and historical geology 
pop and, in the words of Powell, "bring-
ing that ancient subject to life:' 


In this regard, Yale's humanities de-
partments respond more or less like the 
rest of the community, greeting online 
resources with vigor rather than vinegar. 
They upload their syllabi to Classes*~2 
and readily communicate by email. They 
have vocally endorsed Yale's digitiza-
tion projects, which involve the ongo-
ing transfer of hundreds of thousands 
of slides, manuscripts and news archives

Books and computers join forces as educational resources. 
from the shelves of Yale's libraries to a 
tagged -and -searchable online sanctuary. 


Some professors, like Pericles Lewis 
of the English and Comparative Litera-
ture departments, have even ventured 
into cyberspace on their own. Lewis 
founded the Modernism Lab, a collab-
orative research site on early 20th-cen-
tury writers, which hosts around 4,000 
primary sources and a wiki of editable 
articles. He has encouraged his un-
dergraduate classes to use the site as a 
research tool, which is widely praised 
among administrators, faculty, and ITS 
staff metnbers as an exciting step for the 
8 
digital humanities at Yale. 


If humanists like Lewis are embrac-
ing Web-based classroom tools, it may 
· be because these pose no direct threat 
to their disciplines. "The approach to 
studying the material may be different, 
but ultimately the questions at the center 
of it are still traditional humanistic ques-
tions;' Lewis says. 


Answering those questions today 
might involve a six -second Google 
search for "Shakespeare" and "water:' as 
opposed to six weeks reading the Bard's 
entire oeuvre with a highlighter. Still, 
Lewis argues, "the scholarly work of fig-
uring out what's going on with a symbol 
still hasn't changed very much:' In other 
words, the word "water" might appear 
177 times in Shakespeare's plays that 
figure thanks to open-source site Open-
Shakespeare.org but no algorithm on 
the Net will turn that number into an 
argument. 


Online textual concordances like 
those found on OpenShakespeare.org 
are beloved by undergrads. Though it's 
easy to envision their abuse (why read all 
of Moby Dick when you can just query 
"Thar she blows"?), they're considered 
benign by most educators a conve-
nience, rather than a chance to cut cor-
ners. The intellectual activity involved 
in research remains the same, though 
computational data has the potential to 
energize, expand and enhance it. 


Brainpower, revved up by signal 
strength. That's the core id~a behind 
Yale's many tech exertions apd expens-
es 
that the Internet can improve what 
was already good to begin with. It's also 
the idea that motivates Ken Panko, the 
manager of Yale's Instructional Technol-
ogy Group and the man responsible for 
turning Lewis' classroom vision into 
virtual reality. 


Part of what Panko likes about tools 
like class blogs and wikis, he explains, is 
that they boost student creativity onto 
a level where their ideas have practi-
cal, tangible value. "When you write an 
academic paper and you give it to your 
professor, what's the authentic value of 
that? Obviously you've learned a lot in 
the process of creating it, but the artifact 
of your knowledge isn't useful in a way 
that can be shared with the rest of the 
world. But when you publish to a blog, 
you have the opportunity to show peo-
ple what you've done:' 


Panko also favors "active learning;' 
a buzzword among educators and tech-
nophiles. "Try to envision a model of 
teaching where instead of going to lec-
tures, you get that content online;' says 
Panko. "Course sessions would then in-
volve the kind of close interaction you 
might get in seminars, or actual hands-
on work. And the professor becomes 
more of a guide and mentor, rather than 
someone who just stands onstage and 
delivers content:' It would be a turning 
point in Web pedagogy: the moment

Classes*v2 is a popular way for students to download course information. 
when these tools become not just facili-
tators, but educators in their own right. 


In a way, active learning has already be-
gun at Yale. Video recordings oflectures 
have been online at Open Yale Courses 
since 2007. The courses can't be taken 
for credit and there are no discussion 
sections·: But for undergrads who over-
slept and those who weren't enrolled in 
the first place, the online courseware 
system is an important and valuable de-
velopment. 


Of all the ways that Yale has imple-
mented the Internet as a teaching tool, 
Open Yale Courses might also be the 
most surprising a bit, one might ar-
gue, like thunking down the drawbridge 
to the ivory tower. But professional 
Web innovators think that free, online 
courseware is a natural upshot of larger 
trends toward self-directed learning, 
international presence, and the value of 
knowledge as a public good. 


One such innovator is Eric Jansson, 
Director of Labs at the National Insti-
tute for Technology in Liberal Educa-
tion (NITLE). "Networks have exposed 
us to an enormous amount of resources, 
which are increasing in sophistica-
tion all the time:· he says. "Projects like 
MIT's OpenCourseWare are emblem-
atic of this. You're taping some of the 
finest undergraduate lecturers out there, 
and publishing that online it creates a 
really incredible resource:' 


But as Jansson points out, not even 
Web-based tools come risk-free, and 
Yale's investment in these resources 
could eventually backfire. Thanks to 
open course offerings in particular and 
the Internet in general, Jansson says, 
"there's been an explosion of this abil-
ity to manage your own education. The 
question is, how do you react to this 
institutionally? Do you let students con-
sume this material on their own, and 
assume more of a guide-on-the-side 
model?" 


These are the same questions that 
Yale administrators have already been 
asking themselves. By placing course 
materials online, or condoning the use 
of concordances, or . introducing class 
blogs and wikis into the- syllabus, Yale 
is fostering the very skillsets that could 
throw its institutional value into ques-
tion. Sooner or later, someone's going 
to wonder: if all this stuff is online, then 
why am I still sitting here? 


Someone 
has 
been 
wondering, 
namely Anya Kamenetz '02, former 
New Journal editor and the author of 
the recently published DIY U: Edu-
punks, Entrepreneurs and the Coming 
Transformation of Higher Education. 


She writes, "Rather than layering new 
technologies as bells and whistles onto 
existing classes ... courses need to be 
completely redesigned using informa-
tion technology strategically:' If the 
classic liberal-arts model isn't reformed, 
what Kamenetz calls "edupunk" do-it-:-
yourselfNet-based learning will even-
tually dominate the pricey, elite system 
that currently reigns supreme. 


But how likely is "edupunk" to affect 
Yale and institutions with similar values 
and methods? Could the Internet ulti-
mately destroy the liberal arts establish-
ment? 


Jansson, for one, believes that lib-
eral arts education will continue to be 
valuable in the Internet age. "In fact, we 
really need more of it;' he argues. "The 
modern world is really telling us that we 
don't need people with discrete profes-
sional skills, but people who are lifelong 
learners:' 


Modern-day success requires rapid 
adaptability: to new media, new voices, 
new careers. In 2008, the U.S. Bureau of 
Labor Statistics reported that the aver-
age job tenure was 4.1 years, a figure 
that suggests that if you want to join to-
day's workforce, you'd better keep your 
bags by the door and your brain fully 
charged. 


Unlike for-profit and vocational 
schools, liberal arts institutions pride 
themselves on creating exactly that kind 
of flexible intellectual. "The goal is not 
to prepare students for any particular
