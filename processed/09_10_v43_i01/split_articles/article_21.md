EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
common tendencies of boys and girls he 
has seen over almost twenty years in the 
Center. But in his plainspoken way, the 
habit seems respectful, as though the 
children who confide in him have a right 
not to have their vulnerabilities shared 
with the world. 


Back then, medical care began and 
ended with that med box. About a third 
of the children were given no physical 
examination while in the Center. Doctors were only available a few days a 
week, so staff with no medical training 
• 
performed the exams instead. According 
to Stone's federal complaint, children 
were admitted to the general population 
of detainees «with significant communi-
cable diseases such as hepatitis, chicken 
pox, measles, and · staph infections, as 
well as conditions such as ring worm, 
lice, and· scabies" because there was nowhere to quarantine them. 


The consent decree brought major 
changes in the medical treatment given 
to children in the Center, according to 
Bill Carbone of the Judicial Branch. Doctors and nurses are now available around 
the clock in the medical suite, a small 
-
room that looks exactly like an elemen-
tary school nurse's office, complete with 
the requisite posters ("How to Prevent 
the Common Cold;'' 
'~bstinence lets 
you choose your future"). Medicine is 
SEPTEMBER 2010 
no longer dispensed by the line staff, but 
by a licensed nurse. · Yale psychiatrists 
regularly examine those on psychotropic 
medication. Every child is given a physical, and children in need are taken to 
dentists. For some, this is the first check-
up they've had in years. For others, it is 
their first check-up ever. 


Medical care was one of the easier 
things to improve· in . the building, it 
seems. Carbone, who controls most of 
the New Haven Center's budget, was 
((very insightful of the · need" for better 
healthcare, says F:itzgerald, and the superintendent was thankful for this. "You 
can't do this on the cheap;' says Fitzger-
ald. "It's kids lives we're talking about:' 


"Emily has not received any counseling 
juvenile Detention Center, New Haven 
or other mental health interventions. 
She has gone to bed crying at night." 


By the time a child reaches the New 
Haven Juvenile Detention Center, he or 
she has usually seen things that would 
drive most adults to therapy. Though detention isn't intended as a permanent residence, both Joe Mirto and Jack Fitzger-
ald understand that some kids don't want 
to go home. "Some kids are going home 
to things that are worse than what they 
have here:' says Mirto. "Mom may have 
five other kids. She might be 33, and I'm 
a fifteen-year-old kid and I come home 
at night and see her on the couch ... you 
know ... with a man. You can understand 
how that would make me feel:' 


Single mothers aren't the worst of it. 
A 2001 study published in the Review 
of Psychiatry . series found that over 
90% of children in juvenile detention in 
America have experienced at least one 
traumatic incident. Often, this includes 
physical or sexual abuse, or domestic, 
community, or gang violence. It should 
be no surprise, then, that depression and 
suicidal thoughts are common among 
youth in detention. Yet before Emily], 
children with mental health needs were 
not counseled - they were reprimanded 
for acting out. «From what I understand, 
fifteen years ago, it was a largely punitive 
system:' says Donna MacComber, Director of Social Problem Solving Training 
(SPST), a program that educates children 
at the New Haven Center about how to 
manage stressful situations. "There were 
very few therapeutic opportunities:' 


Today, an awareness of mental health 
and suicide prevention is behind every-
thing the children do. WELCOME TO 
DETENTION reads a letter taped to the 
desk on the intake room where children 
are sent when they first arrive. It continues: The first thing you need to know is that 
you are safe. You are going to be fine. 'We are

:~ -:~:.- . every -rep;' he says. "It's not supposed to 
~ ~- ? 
.:~ be p son:' Fitzgerald's own appearance 
echoes this. As he makes his way around 
the building, stopping to meet with children and go over paperwork with staff, 
he cl ps a white ceramic coffee mug with 
"MICI\:EY!" painted in bright red letters 
und 1 a picture of the grinning cartoon 
mou S"' It is difficult to feel scared of a 
gro n man toting Mickey Mouse. 


It is easier to be scared of other parts 
of the Center. Later in the welcome letter taped to the intake desk, the seventh 
thing a child needs to know is this: A staff 
person who is the same sex as you is going to 
do a strip search of you. No one is going to 
touch you. 1hey will have you go in the shower area and have you remove your clothes and 
observe you from several feet away. 1his is to 
make sure you have no injurT.es. The letter 
is calm, understanding, even comforting, but upsetting nonetheless. The same 
might be said of the Center itsel£ 


During intake, children are screened 
for traumatic events that may have occurred in the past. They are asked about 
scho :.1l, family and friends, as well as 
about their history with alcohol, drugs, 
. · and other red flags. "We aren't just looking for how they answer the questions 
verbally;' says Ezekiel, Fitzgerald's deputy. "We pay attention to how they say it, 
if th ·'re forthcoming:' 


What they're looking for, among other 
things, is how closely the child needs 
to be watched. In response to Stone's contention that the Center made no effort at 
suicide prevention, Fitzgerald installed 
a watch system. Next to every residential room is a small, circular metal "hit 
pad:' When children are in their rooms, 
a JDO is responsible for "the pipe;' a 
data recorder that looks like a flashlight · 
with no bulb at the end. Every fifteen 
minutes, the JDO must walk the line 
of rooms, looking through the doors at 
each child and touching the pipe to each 
hit pad. The pipe's internal data recorder 
keeps a history of the times that the pipe 
made contact with each hit pad. At the 
end of each day, the information in. the 
pipe is downloaded onto a computer that 
· cha 
he hits, showing Fitzgerald that 
- his c. 
· -"es are being cared for. Children 
26 
. who raise suspicion during their intake 
screening - through what they say, how 
they sit, whether they make eye contact 
- are checked every four minutes rather 
than every fifteen. And about once every 
two months, the Center has a child on 
"constant'' - acute suicide watch that requires a JDO to be within arm's length of 
the child 24 hours a day. 


Staff note how seriously Fitzgerald 
takes what he refers to as the most pervasive suicide prevention plan in the 
country. ''Jac;:k will never take a kid off 
constant;' says Ezekiel. "He doesn't feel 
he is medically trained to judge mental 
health with such high stakes, and so he 
will keep a kid on constant, even if the 
JDOs think the kid doesn't need it, until 
the child can be examined by a trained 
mental health professional:' 


What they~re looking or, 
among other 
things~ is 
how closely the child needs 
to be watched. 


Fitzgerald defends this paranoia. ''A 
kid doesn't have to say they have a plan 
to hurt themselves for me to put them on 
constant. If I feel he doesn't look right -
that's good enough for me:' The bottom 
line, h~ says, is this: "I am their guardian here. I am responsible not just to the 
court, but to their parents:' Because he 
has children of his own, Fitzgerald says, 
he tries to give other parents' children 
the same attention that he would want 
his kids to have if the situation were reversed. 


Ezekiel is more blunt: "Kids harm 
themselves;' he says. "If they're doubled 
up, they might harm each other. This 
way, they know we're always watching 
them:' 


The watch system is just a small part 
of what is now a facility-wide hyper-
awareness of mental health. The once-
idle afternoon hours have been filled 
with group counseling sessions and education programs developed by psychologists. These programs - Social Problem 
Solving Training ( SPST) and Trauma 
Adaptive Recovery Group Education 
and Therapy (TARGET) - encourage 
children to talk about their feelings and 
experiences and teach them how to best 
manage the two in a way that won't land 
them back in custody, or dead. 


Even before the Center started running SPST and TARGET in response to· 
the consent decree, Mirto say~, he operated under the philosophy that the children in the New Haven Center needed to 
be taught how to articulate their darkest 
thoughts. If a child acts out, he says, he 
rarely chooses to "punish" the child. "I 
rather talk you down - teach you how to 
calm down:' 


It is difficult to tell, in 2009, if Mirto 
really did have an awareness of mental 
health in the early 1990s, but the evidence is strong: of the more than fifty 
JDOs who work in New Haven, Mirto 
is the only one who has spent his career 
representing children in hearings when 
they act out in detention and face disciplinary measures, like solitary room 
time. Mirto insists on advocating for 
-. 
minimal punishment even for the children who are in trouble for disrespeCting 
Mirto himsel£ For this, he has earned the 
nickname "Crazy Joe": crazy, he laughs, 
because he is nearly impossible to anger. 


'"William has not been outside since 
being incarcerated except for a one 
and a half hour furlough for a fu-
neral and a preplacement visit." 


Outside the Center, a basketball court 
sits waiting for good weather. If it 
weren't for the fact that entering the 
Center's indoor gymnasium requires 
going through many locked doors that 
must be opened by staff, recreation 
here would feel like that in any middle 
school gym, complete with professional 
looking floors and a hoop for half-court 
ball. The walls are covered with standard 
blue gym mats for safe games of tag, and 
the ceilings are high, giving a sense of 
freedom to the place. The weight room 
adjacent to the gym looks like a small 
sports club: treadmill, bike, free weights, 
weight machines, and exercise balls fill 
the space. "The boys spend a lot of time 
here;' says Ezekiel. 


In the 1990s, recreation at the Center, if it existed at all, consisted of cards · · 
and outdoor basketball. Girls sat idly 
while boys monopolized the court. On 
cold days, there was nowhere to move 


--- Page 27 ---

around, so everyone sat idly, stadng 
at a TV in a room that might have also 
housed English class earlier that day. Because school and group counseling only 
lasts from about Sam to 4pm, Fitzgerald 
now schedules structured recreation to 
fill the hours between counseling and 
bedtime at 9 or 1 Opm. "We want you to 
be a kid here, too:' he says. "Recreation is 
an important part of being a kid. We try 
to create environments here where you 
can thrive, where it's not just basketball 
every day:' A typical monthly rec schedule rotates small groups around different sports and activities one might find 
at a summer camp: Knockout, Reading, 
Weight Room, Sorry, Checkers, Spelling 
Bee, Blob Tag, Crossword Puzzles, Wiffle 
Ball, Drawing, Obstacle Course. Shat-
. tered is the stereotypical scene of lifting 
barbells in a prison yard. 


Around the Center, rec rooms are 
filled with art supplies, Ping Pong tables, 
Guitar Hero, and board games. One 
locked cabinet holds real African drums 
- "two grand each, at least:' says Ezekiel 
- that the Connecticut Ballet uses on 
Monday nights when they visit the Center to teach the kids about African music 
and dane~. The Open World Leadership 
Center ~nds trips to New Haven for visiting dignitaries. Last year, the Chief Jus-
tice of Liberia came to speak to the children, says Fitzgerald. "That's like Chief 
Justice Roberts coming to speak in your 
classroom, ya know?, 


not been more than two hours a day. 
on many occasions it consisted 
of watching nature films, he has not 
been attending school." 


Every day, Mrs. Michaud begins Eng-
lish class in the Center with the same 
greeting: "Good morning my shining 
stars:' The classrooms at the Center look 
like a regular middle school, and the 
students are treated, to the best of everyone's ability, like they would be "on 
the outside:' In Michaud's room, rows of 
individual desks - grey metal tabletops 
and maroon chairs bolted together - face 
a SmartBoard that doubles as a slide projector. In the far corner, her desk is piled 
high with files, papers, and framed photographs of her family. The walls are covered with possible role models: Martin 
Luther King Jr, Gandhi, the Dalai Lama,, 
John F. Kennedy, Rodin. Everywhere, 
students are confronted with · people · 
meant to inspire them.

They are sons and daughters.
