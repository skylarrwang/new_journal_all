ERHAPS I WILL BE a teacher when 
I grow up. 
I taught this summer and it 
. was wonderful. There was Ryder, who's 
tiny, and writes with neat handwriting, 
and J enna, who walks that fine line 
between popular and kind. There's 
Raheem, who, at eleven years old, is an 
adorable lump, and Jorge, who doesn't 
know how to be cool, who has the most 
earnest eyes and the most staggering 
optimism. 

When 
you're 
a 
teacher, 
each 
day brings rollicking surprise and 
comforting 
consistency. 
You 
read 
sentences about cars made out of 
purple pizza sauce, about instruments 
of cow bones that a dinosaur plays. You 
get used to the student who raises her 
hand every time, and you get used to 
the student who wishes he were a fly on 
the wall so he could just, please, listen, 
without being asked to speak. 

I adored the children I taught. I was 
stunned by the curve of their learning 
and the depths of their hearts. I thought, 
daily; that I had the most wonderful job 
in the world, that 'I could do it forever. 
But then ·came the nagging Yale 
Voice. The nagging Yale Voice that says, 
Kate, you need to run the school system. 
You can teach for two years - Teach For 
America, obviously--- and then you can 
go to law school, and then you can be 
the superintendent .... 

This is the voice that puts the word. 
"just" before the word "teach;' the 
voice that asks if it's the "best use" of 
my education, the voice· that suggests 
that I'd be bored by the daily grind of a 
seventh grade classroom. 

But teaching is harder than Yale 
exams. Teaching is the hardest job I've 
ever done. You need to be on. You need 
to be on from the moment you walk in 
at eight thirty, thinking you've got half 
an hour unt'H the kids come and then 
realizing they're already arrived. You 
need to be on at lunch. You can't just 
corral and silence them, because you 
want them to talk. You want to smile 
enough but not too much and you 
want to be real, but not like a friend. You 
can't swear. You lose your first name . 
You're trying to keep up with this flock 
of chatty h:uman hummingbirds, and 
your feet hurt. You wonder if they won't 
learn if you make jokes. You wonder if 
they won't learn if you're too serious. 
You wonder if they won't respect you if 
you are too kind; you wonder if they'll 
hate you if you're stern. You can't go 
out at night. You've got to sleep. You get 
home hungry, and tired, wishing you 
had the ener~y to run, or to talk, but 
you are beyond exhausted. And in the 
morning, it all begins again. 

R MAYBE,· I'll be a writer when I 
grow up. I think writing is a high 
form of magic. A writer gets to send 
pictures to your head, like telepathy. 
A writer can conjure those slippery 
sliver-memories: she can bring you the 
wet-fresh sumrrier camp art room, the 
lemon-salt air of a laundry machine, the 
spice of your aunfs kitchen. 

So I proudly told a friend the other 
morning that I would bartend when I 
graduated from Yale. 

I was as bold as Kerouac. I told 
him I'd travel the country, hitting up 
six states in one year, six new bars. I(l 
stand each evening pouring drinks and 
drinking in stories. ICl write by day, 
observe by night. I'm not sure when I'd 
sleep, or where. I would eat peanuts and 
pretzels for meals. I'd have bags beneath . · · 
my eyes. My· hair would get curlier, 
messier, and my clothes might fray. I felt 
brave just thinking about it.

Fifteen minutes later, 
sitting in 
lecture, I started to fill out an application 
for Bain & Company a multi-national 
management consulting firm. I couldnt 
even wait until class ended. And · while 
I ignored my professor's lecture on 19th 
Century Mexican immigration, I crossed

But in my three years of college,

I've dropped out of Intra -Economics

sad that I couldnt title the "incentives" 
section of a management case report 
"Good things!" and that there wouldnt 
be time to hear the 'highs and lows' 
of all my co-workers' days amidst the 
New York abustle. I think I'd get lost in 
imagining stories about my clients-
wondering whether or not the CEO of 
the Nature Conservancy we're working 
for has a favorite place in Central Park.
