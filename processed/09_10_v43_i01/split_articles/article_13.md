vocation;' says George Levesque, Yale's 
Assistant Dean of Academic Affairs, "but 
to give them the skills to be prepared for 
anY:' So even as the Internet alters the 
need for Yale's teachers, it creates a need 
for the supple minds they produce. 

But even if liberal arts education 
endures, that doesn't mean liberal arts 
schools will. "One of the problems is, 
we're not sure how stable the vessel for 
that type of education is;' says Jansson. 
He explains that a place like Yale is pro-
tected by its sturdy reputation and gen-
erous endowment, but smaller institu-
tiOil,S might have to make major changes 
in order to survive. 

While Yale students use the Inter-
net extensively, Adam Lior Hirst '1 0, a 
recent graduate and history major, ex-
presses reservations about the changes 
brought about by new media. "Look, I'm 
the kind of guy who'll get really bored 
during lectures, and sit there respond-
ing to emails;' he confesses, "but I think 
there should be a switch to turn off the 
Internet in classrooms!' 

When asked why, Hirst offers sur-
prising rationale for someone of his 
generation: Yale is a liberal arts school, 
not a WiFi hotspot. "The purpose of Yale 
seems to be to spend four years consid-
ering the best that's ever been thought, 
written, said and so on:' he says. "The 
university should force us to do that if 
we can't do it ourselves!' 

Hirst points out that student profi-
ciency or fixation does not always equal 
enthusiasm. We "digital natives" log on 
because we don't know how not to, but 
just because we're media-literate doesn't 
mean we value media literacy, or seek its 
implementation in a classroom. In fact, 
by the time they reach college, many 
students feel quite the contrary. The 
Web may be a teeming information eco-
system, but a flesh-and-blood professor 
provides the invaluable service of orga-
nizing, prioritizing and situating that 
information. We can surf on our own, 
but how effectively can we learn on our 
own? 

Nor is this tepid response to Web 
learning just a Yale phenomenon. EDU-
CAUSE's 2009 report found that while 
70 percent of surveyed students felt 
positively about the use of information 
technology in their courses, 60 percent 
wanted just a "moderate" amount, and 
only a few loose cannons 3.5 percent 
of the sample craved an exclusively 
digital experience. 

If Yale students aren't lobbying for 
digital freedoms, then why have Yale 
faculty members and administration 
worked so hard to bring the Web into 
curricula? Is reframing education still 
an issue if student ambitions are the 
same as they always were? For all the 
Web's purported interfacing, it looks as 
though something important has failed 
to transmit. 

Maybe Yale students are just more 
shortsighted about their education than 
those who provide it. The current crop 
of Yale undergraduates might still bow 
down to the historic mystique of the Ivy 
League, but that doesn't mean that fu-
ture generations will feel the same way. 
As the Net Generation, we feel the loss 
of a culture that we never had in the first 
place. We are not digital natives at all, 
but the children of digital immigrants, 
raised in a virtual society but molded 
equally by the views of our analog for-
bears. 

An inherited sense of old-world nos-
talgia is what makes students pore fond-
ly over the archived, handwritten note-
books of old Elis and wonder if they're 
missing out, even though they can take 
the same notes on a laptop in a quarter 
of the time. It's why Yale is still a tourist 
attraction, and why the campus book-
store can still sell Yale sweatshirts that 
cost more than a WiFi router. 

But that nostalgia won't last forever. 
Jansson's prediction that Yale can subsist 
on its reputation and endowment will 
only hold true as long as we continue 
to value academic isolationism, and the 
idea that spending four years reading 
Kant in a wood-paneled wonderland 
still constitutes a modern education.
