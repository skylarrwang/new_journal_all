FEW BLOCKS WEST of Yale Uni-
versity, on a gritty stretch of 
Whalley Avenue where dishev-
eled old men gather in the morning with · 
paper bags full of scotch, sits a squat tan 
building where children were beaten, 
routinely, as recently as a decade and a 
half ago in what was then one of three 
abysmal juvenile detention centers in 
Connecticut. 


A few blocks west of Yale Univer-
sity, on a gritty stretch of Whalley Av-
enue where young men set up carts in 
the morning selling used cassettes and 
greasy hotdogs, sits a squat tan building 
where children . are given the chance to 
play, to learn, and to start over, in what 
may now be the best juvenile detention 
center in the country. 

What happened? 

The answer lies partly in children 
charged with delinquency, assault, rob-
bery, and sometimes nothing at all, who 
found someone to fight on their behalf. It 
lies partly in an obscure document from 
1997: a consent decree, approved by a 
federal court to settle a 1993 class action 
lawsuit against the state's juvenile de ten-
tion centers. But mostly, the answer lies 
in a decade and a half of hard work car-
ried out by a handful pf individuals who 
believed that Connecticut's most at-risk 
youth deserved more than solitary con-
finement and systemic abuse. 


HE NEw HAVEN JuvENILE Deten-
tion Center is a holding ground. 
Children are brought here on charges 
of assault, sexual assault, robbery, or be-
cause they have broken probation. They 
are ordered to detention w_hile they wait 
for court dates, or for the state to figure 
out where to put them. But jqY;~nile de-
tention is never a final destination, never 
the place for a sentence to be carried 
out. The· average. ti~e a . child ,spends in 
the Centet 'is le'ss than two weeks. In the 
early 1990s, however, juvenile detention 
in Connecticut was closer to hell than to 
purgatory. 

"We had conditions of confinement 
that no one was especially happy with;' 
says Bill Carbone, executive . director of 
the Court · Support Services Division 
(CSSD), the part· of the Connecticut 
Judicial Branch tasked . with manag-
ing juvenile detention: "In addition to 
overcrowding, we didnt feel we had the 
appropriate medical or mental health 
services or recreation services:' Detain-
ees were forced to sleep in pairs on the 
floor of small, overcrowded cells. Medi-
cine, surgery, and food were withheld 
from the children .. Tackling, hitting, and 
twisting the limbs of youth were all en-
couraged as disciplinary tactics. Con-
necticut's two other juvenile detention 
facilities are in Hartford and Bridgeport, 
two of the state's most dangerous cities 
during the 1990s. In all three Centers, 
the state swept its youngest troublemak-
ers off the streets and, f():r lack of a better 
option, forced them into detention. 

Joe Mirto has been.a J~venile Deten.,. 
tion Officer at the New Haven Center for 
twenty years. He is one of fifty-five JDOs, 
the direct care staff responsible for the 
wellbeing of the detainees on a minUte-
to-minute basis. Mirto is a small, pale 
man with a pointed nose and a slight 
paunch. He moves slowly and jokes eas-
ily, but sometimes, like when he talks 
about ~'back then:· he ·is somber. He re-
members the days when ·the average 
daily population in the Center was over 
40 children, though capacity was just 24 
back then. Everything-doctors, beds, 
patience-was in short supply. 

In 1993, conditions were so bad that 
then-director of the Connecticut Civil 
Liberties Union Martha Stone filed a 
lawsuit against the state's three juvenile 
detention centers. "We had been noti-
fied by the public defender's office about 
overcrowding;' recalls Stone. "The places 
were in poor condition - there were not 
enough services, especially mental health 
services, for the children:' Stone's class-
action lawsuit, Emily ] 
v "Weicker, was 
filed on behalf of eight specific children 
and, more broadly, .all the young people 
detained in New Haven, Bridgeport, and 
Hartford. The suit accused the state Ju-
dicial Department, the Department of 
Children and Families (DCF), and the 
three city education department~ of 114 
kinds of mistreatment and neglect of de-
tained youth. 


In 1995, two years after Stone filed 
Emily ], the suit was still stuck in the 
courts when the Director of Detention 
Services, Tom White, decided to try to 
move it along. White asked Stone and the 
federal court to settle the case in a con-
sent decree, rather than continue the case 
through a trial and a potentially lengthy 
appeals. process. In doing so, he acknowl-
edged the merit of many of Stone's alle-
gations and agreed to work towards her 
proposed changes. "I felt that the condi~ · 
tions in the centers were unacceptable;· 
White explained. "If we felt we wanted 
to make dramatic changes to detention 
in the state, why fight the lawsuit when 
we could partner with the court and the 
CCLU under the consent decree?" Do-
ing so, White explained, would be less 
expensive in the long term and would 
give the state . a court -ordered reason to· 
continue to improve conditions . 

The suit accused the state 
judicial Department, the 
Department o Children 
and Families (DCF), and 
the three city education 
departments o 114 kinds 
o 
mistreatment 
and 
neglect o detained youth. 


The 1997 consent decree and addi-
tional agreements negotiated in 2002 and 
2005 have transformed the Connecticut 
juvenile detention centers from some 
of the worst in the nation to some of 
the best. Today, Connecticut is the only 
state nationwide whose public juvenile 
detention centers are accredited by both 
the American Correctional Association 
(ACA) and the National Commission 
on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC), 
the two standard-bearing organizations 
in the field. These accreditations are not 
nominal. To be accredited by ACA alone, 
detention facilities must go through an 
involved, three-year process that mea-
sures more than four hundred criteria, 
down to the types of screws used in win-
dow frames. Dual accreditation signals 
that the Connecticut centers are among 
the· most progressive in the nation, em-
phasizing detention as an opportunity 
not just to house children but to rehabili-
tate them. The New Haven Center scored 
above 99% on both accreditations, an 
unprecedented feat. 

The progress has been a direct result 
of the original lawsuit filed by Martha 
Stone. It is no surprise, then, that the al-
legations Stone laid out in the "statement 
of facts" portion of her lawsuit act as a 
guide to the biggest changes that were 
needed, ·and made, in the New Haven 
Center over the last decade and a half. 

The difference, says current New Haven 
detention superintendent Jack Fitzger-
ald, is night and day. But really, the dif-
ference is Fitzgerald. For it was he- a sil-
ver-haired, professorish man who talks 
just as frequently about feelings as about 
actions - who brought on the dawn . 

"1993 Statement of Facts 
Description ofPJaintiffs: 
Michael is sleeping on the floor be-
of the overcrowding, locked in a 
room with another child." 

After four consecutive years of de-
cline in the number of juveniles detained 
in Connecticut, the state's detention cen-
ters began to crowd again in 2010. Ow-
ing to Stone's lawsuit, the New Haven 
Center, at least, is better equipped to deal 
with the uptick. It has improved medical 
and mental health services, recreational 
options, education, and disciplinary tac-
tics. But most obvious to the naked eye 
are the changes to the building itself. 

Superintendent since 1999, Fitzgerald 
is a congenial man with small, piercing 
eyes behind round silver frames. He is 
tall, a commanding presence softened 
by tweed jackets, nubby sweaters, and 
a constant, vaguely Southern-sounding 
"ya know?" that punctuates his sentenc-
es. On first impression, and even second, 
he seems more like a librarian than a 
warden. Fitzgerald has perfected the air 
of a man charged with overseeing a high-
stress environment: relaxed but u nques-
tionably firm. And at the core of his work 
is his conviction that he runs a detention 
center, not a prison. He seems to have a 
personal stake in the distinction. 

The consent decree mandated better 
living conditions, and Fitzgerald obliged. 
"The original plant was poorly designed 
for children;' he explains. "It was more 
like a prison than any prison we had built 
for adults:' The interior had minimal rec-
reation space. Sparse, dark rooms tripled 
as classrooms, rec rooms and spaces for 
gro.up meetings. The building was de-
void of any natural light. For twenty-four 
hours a day, children lived, worked and 
fought under a dull fluorescent glow. 


"The rooms were dark, dank;' he says. 
"The upkeep of the painting wasn't done:' 
In the cells, beds - of which there were 
usually too few - were steel platforms 
jutting out of the wall a few feet from a 
steel toilet. Children who didn't have a 
bed got a sleeping pad on the ·floor. 

He points to the paint 
trim aro.und the hallways 
and inside the classrooms: 
C(Maroon and Connecticut 
Blue, the same colors that 
are inside public schools 
across the state. · It looks 
like the outside world." 

Perhaps because they no longer feel 
like jail cells, no one who works in the 
Center calls them "cells" anymore. They 
are "individual bedrooms" on the "resi- · 
dential side" of the building. Now, each 
small room· has a bunk bed made from 
smooth, curved tan plastic that matches 
a few other pieces of furniture in the 
room. The bed looks, if not quite like a 
bed, at least like a comfortable resting 
place in a child's jungle gym. On each 
bunk is a thin mattress and the types of 
pillows, sheets, and blankets you would 
find at an airport motel. There are no 
toilets in the renovated bedrooms. "You 
shouldn't have to go to the bathroom 
in front of anyone else;' says Fitzgerald. 

There is still little natural light on the 
residential side - just a square foot of 
glass close to the ceiling of each room -
but the overall effect, Fitzgerald says, is a 
vast improvement. He is right. A room 
full of plastic furniture and no light can't 
be called inviting, but at least it does not 
feel like punishment. 


In the 1990s, . overcrowding com-
pounded the already depressing condi-
tions, making the Center unbearable. 
Today, JDOs like Joe Mirto work one or 
two of three eight-hour shifts at the Cen-
ter. When it was filled above capacity in 
the 1990s, Mirto remembers, Fitzgerald 
would need to staff twelve JDOs on each 
of the two daytime shifts and . six JDOs 
on the graveyard shift from midnight to 
eight in the morning :... in total, sfx more 
officers daily than he now needs.· Back 
then, Mirto recalls with a shake of his 
head, everyone was stretched thin. 

Today, capacity in the facility is 42, 
but no more than twelve are generally 
there on a given day. Until 2005, children 
identified by DCF, Connecticut's child 
welfare agency, as members of Families 
With Service Needs (FWSN) were de-
tained in the Center. "They didn't have to 
have done anything illegal;' says Joe Eze-
kiel, one of Fitzgerald's deputies. "FWS~ 
(pronounced fwiz-en) kids coul4 be run-
ning away from home, skipping school, 
having sex too young - anything that 
made the parents nervous. The parents 
could ask DCI:' for help:' 1hroughout 
the 1990s, most of the children in deten-
tion were designated as FWSN 14ds ... ~y 
the time Martha Stone filed Emily], the 
state had filled one of the more violent 
detention centers in the country beyond 
capacity with children who often hadn't 
actually broken the law. 

In 2005, Connecticut decriminalized 
FWSN so that in most cases, children 
could no longer be placed into deten-
tion merely for worrying t~eir parents. 
The population at all three centers has 
_dropped dramatically as a result. 

The biggest changes to th~ building 
are the most recent. In September 2008, 
New Haven finished construction on two 
new classrooms, an administrative wing, 
a weight room, two recreation rooms, a 
recreation office, and a gymnasium ;with 
high glass windows that fill the entire 
new wing with natural light. The extra 
space has given the Center more op-
tions for how to keep children occupied 
throughout the day. "These changes im-
pact the rest of the environment;' says 
Fitzgerald. "We build our programming 
so that kids can be in that area, exposed 
to the natural light as much as possible:' 

Fitzgerald speaks constantly about 
bringing light to the building, not just 
for the children, but for the staff who 
spend their days inside. One of the worst 
parts about working in the Center in the 
1990s, he says, was that no matter which 
shift you worked in the winter - 12am to 
Sam, Sam to 4pm, or 4pm to 12am - it 
would still be dark on the way to work, 
dark all day inside the building, and 
dark again when the shift was over. "You 
could go entire weeks without seeing re-
ally any natural sunlight;' he explained. 
"Can you imagine? And if the staff were 
so down because of this - how must the 
kids feel?" 

Fitzgerald i$ good at his job and the 
New Haven Center is one .of the best 
nationwide precisely because 'the super-
intendent makes it a point to imagine 
how the kids feel. Every other week, he 
has lunch alone with the children, using 
the time to ask what they would change 
about the Center. Often, Mirto says, 
Fitzgt;rald takes these suggestions. 

"Michael has been diagnosed as having 
a systolic heart mununr and an umbili-
cal herliia. Although he is in need of 
an operation, he has not yet received 
"t , 

Before Emily J, remembers Joe Mirto, 
the Center's veteran JDO, medical care 
was almost nonexistent. Mirto talks of-
ten of the years when the job was done 
differently. "We had a med box that we 
kept in the control room:' he says. "It 
wasn't kept locked. A lot of kids come in 
here on controlled substances - lithium, 
Ritalin, l)epakote. The kids would line 
up outside the window and weo yell out 
for him: 'Jimmy, it's time for your lithi-
um: We realized, if I'm a fifteen year old 
kid, I'm probably not too happy if that's 
being yelled out in front of everybody:' 

In conversation, Mirto is careful 
never to tell stories of specific children. 
He makes oblique references: Imagine if 
you were fifteen... When you come into the 
Center with mental health issues. . . Prob-
ably, -the references are composites - the
