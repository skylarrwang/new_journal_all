Dinner in 5771 
. JEWISH LAW HOLDS THAT meat and 
dairy must be stored apart, served with 
different utensils, and consumed sepa-
rately. Shaking his head in somber em-
barrassment, Timothy Frye, who has 
. been head chef at Yale's Slifka Center 
for five years, admits he doesn't know 
why. He must not realize he is in the 
majority. Stumped by the $arne ques-
tion, medieval Torah guru Maimonedes 
reasoned that meat boiled in milk was 
too filling and "undoubtedly gross:' But 
most follow Kashrut, Jewish dietary law, 
because it is just that: unequivocal, con-
crete, law-the will of God as expressed 
to Moses and codified in the Mishnah. 
Tonight, Rosh Hashanah, is a meat 
night. 
. 
· The sun has set behind West Rock 
and the evening is one · of mandatory 
rest, just not for the staff of the Slifka 
center's Kosher Kitchen. Yamulked boys 
and girls with pearl necklaces stream up 
to the serving station in droves, platters 
extended. 
"Is the peanut butter on the table 
parve?" a bespectacled girl shouts over· 
the line. 
"Can we get more challah?" asks an-
other. 
"Shana tova!" calls a girl in ·a lace 
dress, to no one in particular. 
The serving station resembles the 
skeleton of a steel barn, the gabled roof 
gently dividing the servers and the 
served. The kitchen itself is split into 
two chambers that join in front at the 
serving area: dairy in the smaller left 
ventricle, and meat on the right. 
Dressed in a black double-breast-
ed cooking shirt with woven balls for 
buttons, Tim flits around the kitchen, 
gingerly lifting Saran wrap veils off of

-
his creations. A chef of nearly two de-
cades, he casts a trained eye over each 
pan, straightening the rows of chicken 
breasts and tossing the melange of pearl 
onions, peas, eggplant and peppers so 
that it resembles . an avant...,garde chil-
dren's ball pit. Scratching his head, Tim 
wonders out loud where the cauliflower 
is. He spies it across the kitchen and 
nods. Satisfied, he claps his hands and 
his staff grab red-handled tongs and 
prepare to start serving. 
A formidable army of such blood-
. . 
colored utensils hangs at attention on 
a steel rod above the meat sink, like 
disembodied lobster· claws-though ac-
cording to Kashrut, real lobster would 
never be allowed in the · kitchen. Over 
the dairy sink a complementary infan-
try of blue tongs dangles idly, off duty. 
Dante, a hulking man in a red and 
black flat-brimmed hat, heaps flakey 
mountains of brisket onto platters next 
to Jezarelle, who handles the roast 
chicken and tomatoes. A wing tip of her 
butterfly tattoo peeping from behind 
her hoop-laden ear, Ronesha hacks 
away at a pan of sweet noodle kugel, 
sliding ragged -'edged rectangles onto 
students'· plates. She doesn't like the 
stuff herself-"Sweet pasta? Weird:' -but 
seems pleased that her a dairy-free con-
coction of egg noodles, brown sugar, 
eggs, cinnamon, ·margarine and raisin 
studs is disappearing faster thari. the po-
tato version Dante baked. 
While the meat side of the kitchen 
hums, the dairy side sleeps. Leek stalks 
lie in the sink, their fuzzy roots still cov-
ered in water droplets, and beet plants 
rest on a cutting board next to a bowl 
full of pomegranates. Six small pump-
kins beg to be carved, or at least made 
into pie. On top of a heated convection 
oven sit cobalt cooking mitts labeled 
. DAIRY, in white lettering. Small images 
of a fork, spoon and knife follow the Y 
like exclamation points. 
None of the staff is Jewish, but out 
of habit, Tim shops kosher for himself 
as well as for the Slifka kitchen. On 
the wall of his Lilliputian office in the 
back corner of the meat kitchen, he has 
tacked a sheet of permissible kosher 
symbols-block letter Ks, encircled Us, 
and Cs enveloping the letters HK and 
topped with regal crowns. Tim must in-
spect every processed food item that en-
ters the Slifka building for such a mark. 
It has taken him years, but he has finally 
memorized all 96. 
Meats pose an even greater chal-
lenge. Only animals that have both 
cloven hooves and chew their cud are 
considered kosher; this bars hares, pigs, 
hyraxes and camels-though Tim men-
tions those last two are rarely missed. 
These pronged-footed masticators must 
die at the hands of Rabbis who slit the 
animals' throats to most quickly end 
their pain. Jews must not consume the 
creatures' blood, and once their veins 
and capillaries have run dry, meat must 
be hewed from the animals' shoulders, 
never the rump. Leviticus pronounces 
all fish with both fins and scales pure, 
and dismisses the rest -shellfish, squid, 
shark, and catfish-as filth. 
Tim views_ the Slifka kitchen as aha-
ven - a place where kosher students can 
enjoy meals without worry and non-ko-
sher students can relax and simply enjoy 
good food. "A home away from home:' 
he calls it. Tim urges kids to bring him 
family recipes and immortalizes regular 
patrons like Nate Glasser '11-the inspi-
ration for "Nate's Famous Corned Beef" 
-on his menu. Josh Price '11 still awaits 
a namesake, but not for lack of rapport 
with the Slifka kitchen staff. He has eat-
en almost every lunch and dinner there 
since his freshman move-in night and 
often hangs to shoot pool with Tim and 
Dante after they close down the kitchen. 
"Dante taught me most of what I know 
about pool;' Josh says. "_But I beat him 
pretty regularly now:' 
It is an unlikely image: Josh, a com-
pact Judiac Studies major predisposed 
to cable-knits and side-parts, taunting 
the colossal Dante across Slifka's well-
varnished pool table. But it's what the 
Slifka kitchen-where muscle and milk 
cannot touch, but Muslims who observe 
Halal and Jews who keep kosher discuss 
-literature over Parve pasta cooked by 
bacon-loving Christians-is all about. 
A place where food must bear a kosher 
label, but labeled folk-"football jocks': 
"section assholes': "uber jews·: "hip-
sters': "staff': "students" -Inix like racked . 
stripes and solids before the break.
