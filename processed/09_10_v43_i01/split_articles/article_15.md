life away:' 
Friends and family from home tend 
to view these internships as prestigious, 
even though entry-level work in an office 
on Capitol Hill, as in any other office, can 
be dull. 
"We're certainly expendable;' jokes 
Hu. ''There's an army of us:' 
There are about two thousand interns 
on Capitol Hill every summer, sprinkled 
across all 535 congressional · offices. It's 
enough undergraduates to form a small 
liberal arts college. 
Hu expresses frustration over those 
interns who aren't humble about their 
. 
jobs. "You need some perspective:' he 
said. A congressional internship "inflates 
people's egos. It's horrifyfng:' 
David Manners-Weber '1 0 spent two 
of his undergraduate summers working 
on Capitol Hill. "I think there is an 
impression that Hill interns are bright, 
ambitious, and sometimes a little too big 
for their britches. As far as stereotypes 
go, it's not a bad one:' he wrote in an 
email message. "You go to work in 
important -looking buildings and are in 
close proximity to important people it's 
easy to get it into your head that you're 
an important person:' 
There is even a widely-read blog 
dedicated to mocking interns who think 
too highly of themselves called "Spotted: 
DC [Summer] Interns:' The blog's 
readers e-mail the editors with stories 
about interns embarrassing themselves. 
The following post is from this July: 
Heard: The Fifth of July 
I was in Longworth Cafeteria last week 
when I overheard two valley girls with red 
badges the table over. There was nothing out 
of the ordinary until the following exchange: 
Intern 1: Is july 5th, like, a federal 
holiday? 
Intern 2: Ummm. I don't think so. 
Intern 1: Then, why do we have offi 
Intern 2: Maybe it's because, like it was 
the first full day they really got to celebrate 
the Declaration of Independence. 
Posts on the site feature interns all 
over the city, but most of the blog's 
unwitting protagonists are wearing the 
ubiquitous red identification badge of 
congressional interns, which the blog's 
editors have nicknamed "the red badge 
f 
, 
o courage. 
"God, it's awful," says Hu, when I ask 
him about the site. 
Villano thinks this stereotype of 
congressional interns isn't quite fair. 
"Potentially, people come in with greater 
ambitions -- and then they end up 
making coffee;' she says. "But for the 
most part, the interns I interacted with 
were good-natured people who were 
interested in politics the way I was." 
Waller 
contrasts 
the 
distribution o 
ages in 
Congess with the corporate 
world. ''We have a range 
o ages in teh o ce, not a 
gaggle o _ 17-year-olds. "

the city, congressional interns 
and staff can enjoy a busy social life. 
Hu and the other interns in Chu's office 
go out for dinner regularly, and when 
there's a chance to eat for free anywhere 
on · Capitol Hill, they take advantage. 
When I met with Hu, they had recently 
sampled corn products at CornFest, 
an everit for congressional staffers and 
interns sponsored by the National Corn 
Growers Association. 
And at nighttime, Hu and his roomate 
band with other Yalies to visit dubs and 
bars around Washington, which are 
filled with revelers working in advocacy 
groups, lobbying firms, policy research 
centers, the press, and every branch of 
government. 
"It's amazing how much of the 
government is run by people under 35;' 
as Manners-Weber wrote . 
This is especially true of Congress, 
where legislators depend heavily on their 
aides' advice. ccThere is no way members 
of Congress 
can 
make 
informed 
decisions on every vote:' Hu insists. 
There are too many issues, committee 
meetings are scheduled for overlapping 
times, and most members return home .·· 
on weekends to talk to voters. 
That leaves much of the work of 
legislating with senior staff, who are often
