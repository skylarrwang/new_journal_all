at airports. Recalling the voice of the 
woman on the phone, my skin prickled. I 
feared the worst. I called my mother. She 
suggested a companion, but this was out 
of the question 
I needed to undertake 
this 
mission 
alone. 
I 
wasn't 
even 
getting tattooed. I was going to gather 
• 
information, compare prices, finalize the 
details of my design. This, like buying 
a car or choosing a boyfriend, required 
serious thought, diligent research, and 
extreme circumspection. I was preparing 
to make a permanent commitment, and, 
true to form, I refused to be rash. I had 
to be fully informed. 


Nonetheless, I was gradually letting 
go of my vice-like grip on the direction 
of my life. I felt like Emma Bovary on 
her way to a clandestine rendezvous with 
one of her lovers: restless, deterinined, 
manic. Seduced, I was definitely not in 
total control. Though I told my next-
door neighbor that I was going to 
interview a "local artist" (a stretch, but 
tattoos are art, I thought to myself), I 
was subconsciously tapping a dark, deep-
running current, refusing to acknowledge 
34 
•• 
that I was following its course. And yet I 
was listening, acting, allowing myself to be 
/ 
pulle forward. Coursing in my blood was 
som thing the Spanish call duende, a word 
th~i is untranslatable because the concept 
is· too fundamental to permit dissection. 
It is a basic attraction to the mysterious 
and the passionate, an understanding of 
the connection between suffering and 
love, and a deep respect for the aesthetic 
and the sensual. Like the opening strains 
of the flamenco guitarist, this inner 
voice painfully stirred something in my 
bones. It was irresistible, a call to action, 
a 1/amada. This bizarre pull explained the 
presence of leopard print in my wardrobe 
alongside oxford and argyle, the continual 
dancing, the awe of physical grace, and 
the persistent desire to emblazon an 
image permanently on my skin. 


at kind of clientele do you have?" 
I asked, looking hard into the 
young tattoo artist's pale, bright eyes. 
"That's like asking what the weather's 
going to be like today. We get everybody. 
We get doctors, lawyers, kids off the 
street who think they're gangsters. We 
get Guilford moms ... Tattooing went 
mainstream in, say, 1995." 


As I looked at the striking maroon 
walls and gold curtains, the spotless 
office, 
and 
kind 
man 
who 
approached his vocation with gravitas 
and skill, I realized the depth of my own 
pretensions. Tattoo art was not a game. 
People inside Studio Zee were fulfilling 
their vocational callings; their work was 
serious; their business, clean and highly 
professional. These artists could discern 
all kinds of motives in their clientele. I 
could only wonder what this man thought 
-. 
of me, with his clinical directness, his 
strong handshake, his gentle humor. He 
patiently listened to my specifications for 
the tattoo's design and location. He gave 
me prices, medical information, time 
restrictions. He ignored the slight waver 
in my voice, my breathlessness, and my 
·air of inexperience. 


"Why do you do this?" 
''What, tattooing? Because I love it." 


Oddly, during our brief exchange we 
found common ground. I was soothed;

During the bus ride home, scribbling, 
I felt nauseous and gleeful. I was drunk 
on the thrill of this strange hunt. I had 
stood calmly and somewhat coherendy in 
the lobby of a New Haven tattoo parlor 
jotting cold, hard facts about turning. 
my smoky imaginings into an inky black 
reality. I didn't run away when one of 
a

''Yeah, he should be done soon. They're 
doing the red of the stripes in the flag."

thought back to my next-door neigh'

Why had I evaded his question? The

s August persisted in its russet, 
languor, I found I cou:ld not abandon • 
my quest. I perversely craved permanent : 
evidence of a decision entirely my own. I ' 
on 
kept finding hints scattered through the 
summer da s. Dictionar y.com's word of 
the day on August 18th was "tattoo": "1.) 
A rapid, rhythmic dr 
· g or rapping. 
2.) The beat of a drum, or . sound of a 
trumpet or b:ugle, giving notice to soldiers 
to go to their quarters at night" 
the same 
rhythmic call I was increasingly unable to 
ignore. I found 
1a black card amongst the 
remains of my trip to Rome. I had picked 
up at a club party held in a huge wh4-_te 
buH.ding, a vestige of Mussolini's attempl 
\ to build a new Rome. Beneath a drawing 
. 
pf':a bleeding hand, it read: ''Mela Tattoo 
tu&io." The studio of apples. Tempted, 
I }>ondered. The strains of that hidden 
guitar called to me, the steps of the 
• {famadrz unfolding in my brain. I could feel 
the pounding of my heels, the rushing of 
adrenaline, the burning of the muscles in 
my legs. The composition birthed already 
in my mind, I felt the weight of my own 
role in its execution, subsumed in its 
larger unity. 


I visited other tattoo parlors. In each, 
I listened and watched, heart thumping. 
I was a voyeur, blending with my 
surroundings, feigning total confidence. 
In one, I overheard a woman dressed 
sharpl in a pencil skirt and leather sling-
backs discuss in low tones the script she 
wanted written on her inner wrist. The 
35 


tattoo artist was reluctant. Her 
was too small and he feared it 
over the next decade. Perhaps

piece of paper. 'J'ifu trained grace and

asked if the studio had time for a walk-

business card into my bag and returned ·""

ate in the month, I was on the phone 
the library of my house. I had been 
muHing over my idea for days, replaying 
reconsidering 
my 
experiences, 
wavering between total conviction and 
terror. As I sat tracing the designs of the 
· rug, I listened to the low, male voice on 
the other end tell me he had something 
to say about tattoos. Really, I . thought? 
More dissuasion, no doubt. · Like many 
close to me, he was perturbed by my 
quest. Though he had never articulated 
his qualms, I could pick them out of 
his mind. My fascination with tattooing 
myself seemed odd, out of line, unduly

weeks previously,

He had looked up at me,

,u., fresh composure and apparent

at the note, paused, and asked, 
';>" 


That day on the phone he carefully told 
me about a new technology that injects ink 
in the f<:>rm of tiny sealed pellets, forming 
a picture in the way a color printer forms 
a comic strip illustration. The benefit, he 
said, is that these tattoos disappear when 
struck with a laser, since the pigment 
does not bleed into the skin. Voild. Easily 
removable. "Thought you might want to 
know," he said. 


Yes, I thought, good to know. And for 
a while after our conversation, it seemed 
like an easy solution to the objections, 
the insistence that I would be dissatisfied, 
that I would change my mind. But no. 
These long summer afternoons had given 
me time to digest the magnetic pull of my 
quest. Freshly twenty years old, I had a. 
great sense of both the fertility latent in 
the future and the rare, transient power 
of this moment in time. A quarter of 
the way through my projected lifespan, 
something primal- stirred within me, 
drawing me towards a private act of self-
claiming. I felt a need to stand alone, 
stripped free of the identities that had 
clung ·to me through life. Ultimately, I 
found tattoos beautiful and my skin a 
blank canvas all my own. 


This was not an act of rejection, but 
of renewal. It was no longer about toeing 
the line. A sudden shedding had left me 
raw, shell-shocked by a newfound sense 
of power. I owned this vessel, and I felt 
compelled to run its young, smooth hull 
through risky straits. I was not .sailing in a 
fleet of other boats, I was in full control 
of the rudder, and my course was not to 
be influenced by the destinations of the 
boats native to my calm harbor. 


When I'm ready, there will be no tiny, 
sealed pellets and no painkillers. I will be 
alone, in New Haven, with no minibus, 
no companion, and no doubts. No one 
will know the day or the hour. I will take a 
cab, wear jeans, and bring cash. There will 
be no going back. As I feel the first sting 
of the needle, my brain will play back the 
opening strains of the llamada. It will be 
full-throttle or not at all.
