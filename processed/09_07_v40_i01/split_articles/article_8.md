**Stitch 'n Bitch**
**Author: Mai Wang**
**Page number(s): 5-6**

IN THE BATHROOM OF AN AIRPLANE; AT 
the back of ABP; even in the middle of 
jury duty, across the country bored and 
frustrated women are doing it everyw-here, 
letting loose and rediscovering the joy 
of an age-old past-time. In a world of 
ready-made blankets and store-bought 
scarves, women have begun to rem~mber 
the pleasure of making things with their 
hands. In recenLyears, kniu ing has come 
back in a big way, and with its rise have 
come legions of women looking to join 
social networks: New Haven's chapter of 
Stitch 'n Bitch, a nationwide group that 
organizes local kniu ing circles, now claims 
September 2007 
283 members. Local founder Karen 
explains, "I bought Deb Stoller's first 
book, Stitch 'n Bitch: The Knitter~ Handbook 
in December 2003, and taught myself how 
to knit. I made a New Year's resolution to 
join a knitting group, but I couldn't find 
one. So I convinced my friend Aileen to 
knit with me every Wednesday evening 
at Koffee? on Audubon St." As others 
filtered in, the small, local coffee shop 
couldn't afford to lose its chairs to a sit-
in of a dozen women not buying drinks, 
so now they meet four times a week in 
retail chains throughout Connecticut. 
Sundays are held in the Yale Bookstore, 
Mondays in Woodbridge, Thursdays at 
the Pan era Bread in North Haven, and 
tonight it's Wednesday at the Au Bon Pain 
on the corner of York and Elm Streets. 

S'nB is refashioning the classic image 
of the knitter. Although the women 
continue the long tradition of gathering 
in a room with sewing projects on 
their laps, thete are no white granny 
caps to be seen, and no one's hair is 
in a bun. Despite its name, none of 
the members..,. are particularly prone to 
complaining; once in a while, someone 
will mention a dropped stitch. It's a bevy 
of bespectacled women in their 20s and 
30s, and the gossip is strictly fiber-centric. 

Early on, only Heather and Katy 
have arrived, two quiet women with 
skeins of yarn. Heather is busy knitting 
miniature pink and brown socks for her 
four-year-old daughter. "My daughter's 
tiny," she explains. "She doesn't grow." 
Right now she's teaching her how 
to knit. "I have hign hopes for her," 
she says, crossing her fingers on one 
hand and her needles in the other. 

Katy is making a sweater for herself, 
her most ambitious project yet. One 
sleeve 
dangles 
complete, 
and 
she 
contentedly tries it on as she goes. But 
when she's knitting for others, Katy's 
projects sometimes involve a kind of 
vague sorcery. ''Every time I start making 
a baby blanket, someone tells me they're 
pregnant!" she says with a shrug, as if her 
knitting were somehow entwined with 
the reproductive future of her friends. 
Mostly she knits as meditation, and she 
loves to sneak her needles into forbidden 
places. ''I did it on jury duty," she admits, 
"and it takes away the frustration of 
siu ing on the airplane." She stitches away 
while we talk, her needles clicking steadily. 

Jackie 
Nancy, 
first-time 
· Stitch'nBitchers, turn up next. They're 
coworkers· at the New Haven Courthouse 
who've decided to extend their lunch 
break addiction into the evening hours. 
Nancy started knitting three years ago, 
and Jackie is her blonde protegee. Besides 
the standard sweaters, socks, and scarves, 
they've also made fingerless gloves, 
handbags, ponchos ("we never wear them, 
but they're beautiful") and stuffed animals: 
"I knit turtles with detachable shells for 
my kids last year," Jackie shares proudly, 
but reveals that they repaid her by playing 
limbo with her yarn, stretching a thread 
across the room and running under it. So 
tonight Jackie is a self-confessed "selfish 
knitter": she's making a checkerboard 
wrap, a patchwork of purple, gray and 
black squares,· which she plans to ·use 
as a winter staple in her own wardrobe. 

''Actually," she says, "I recycle a lot 
I'll 
wear a sweater a couple of times, rip it 
out and reuse the yarn." She's constantly 
inventing new clothes from . old fibers. 

The women arrive in pairs, but no 
one shares the same pattern or color of 
yarn. The methods. vary, Heather tells me. 
Stitches can be traced to their owners' 
strings of DNA: differentpeopleknitwith 
tighter or looser stitches, so their swatches 
will come out smaller or bigger, and each 
woman has her own trademark stitch. 

Soon there are 15 gathered at the 
wooden table, and it's clear from the 
varying speeds of the needles that the 
world of kniu ing comes wrapped in 
its own hierarchy. The best knitters can 
produce a basic scarf in a few hours. A 
tote bag is a. day, a sweater four weeks, and 
lace shawls can bleed into two seasons. 

A cedar chest is a must to keep moths 
away from fluffy skeins of wool, although 
a bag of lavender will also do the trick. 

As with any ancient art-form, knitting 
too has its own set of old wives' tales and 
superstitions: ''Heather, you never get 
second sock syndrome?" Jackie asks in 
wonder. This happens when a knitter has 
finished one perfect sock but suddenly 
gets bored with the prospects of making 
its identical twin. Later, Karen tells me 
of the Boyfriend Sweater Curse: ''Never 
knit a sweater for your boyfriend. He 
won't appreciate the effort you put into 
it, and it'll cause your break." Others in 
5 


the_ circle propose a remedy to ward off 
such mishaps. They bring out a book of 
"Naughty Needles: Sexy, Saucy Knits 
for the Bedroom and Beyond," and are 
greeted by a round of general giggling. 
"That's probably the only kind of knitting 
my husband would like," jokes Jackie. I 
learn that it is possible to knit a corset, 
a whip, and even a straitjacket. A more 
benign sequel arrives with "Charmed 
Knits: Projects for Fans. of Harry 
· Potter." The book includes elaborate . 
diagrams for making wizard robes, wand 
cozies, elf hats for babies, golden snitch 
balls, and even an invisibility cloak. 

Karen points to the glass windowpanes 
behind us. Pedestrian onlookers stare as 
they cross the street. Suddenly it feels 
as if the group is inside an aquarium 
being watched by an audience. "I like 
knitting in this spot," she confesses. 
"It feels like performance art." For the 
women of Stitch'n Bitch, knitting is a 
chance to. air out their domestic selves. 


**How Bequests Are Made**

How Bequests Are · 
on 

THIS SEMESTER, THE YALE UNIVERSITY ART 
Gallery will debut its most recent and eye-
popping acqwsitions. From September 
to January, an exhibit titled "Art for 
Yale" will display works the Gallery ·has 
received or purchased since Director 
Jock Reynolds' arrival in 1998. 
The 
exhibit will include over three hundred 
major works, only a few of which are 
currently on display. Jill Westgard, the 
Gallery's 
Director of Development, 
described all the works as "ones a student 
would study in Art History 1 01." Chief 
Cuq.tor Susan Matheson hopes the 
exhibit will embody the Gallery's recently 
revitalized aim "to inspire artists as much 
as art historians" and to incorporate 
the personal interests of Yale students, 
faculty, museum staff, and donors in 
their efforts to create an active dialogue 
and a dynamic, . far-reaching institution. 

As students and faculty rediscovered 
the Gallery's ·masterpieces at the Kahn 
Building's reopening last year, many may 
have wondered how such world-renowned 
art found its way to ·New Haven. The 
YUAG receives some bequests and 
endowments as unexpeeted windfalls. 
Several years ago, an elderly amateur 
art collector joined her local retirement 
home's field trip to the Yale University Art 
Gallery. She fell in love with the Gallery, 
and decided to anonymously donate her 
fifty Greek and Roman pieces to Yale. 

However~ most gifts result from an 
extensive series of conversations among 
museum curators, private collectors, 
and University faculty. With knowledge 
of the major private collections in his 
or her field, .each curator approaches 
poten~al donors and works with the 
Development Office to capitalize on any 
Yale connections. Each of the Gallery's 
departtnents compiles a wish list of the 
art it is seeking. While these goals guide 
curators' recruitment efforts, flexibility 
also proves · essential in order to seize 
singular opportunities, like an unexpected 
trove of antiquities recently acquired 
when the Albright-Knox Museum in 
Buffalo, NY auctioned off its collection. 

When recruiting potential donors 
and negotiating conditions for gifts, the 
YUAG emphasizes its unique role as 
an active teaching museum. 
Still, the 
Gallery competes with other museums 
in its acquisition efforts. To persuade 
families to leave their art to Yale, curators 
remind donors that art from the YUAG 
often replaces slides in Yale classrooms 
while works at large civic museums may 
remain in storage for long and dusty 
stretches. 

Some donors to the YUAG 
take this further than the museum would 
like, and impose conditions on their 
gifts that stipulate how often the works 
can travel or how many of their pieces 
0 
must be on display at a given time. The 
Gallery, however, prefers "thf flexibility 
to rotate exhibitions and loan· items, and 
typically enters such negotiations only 
for extremely significant works. It also 
foregoes offers that overlap the existing 
collection, and instead works with donors 
to procure gifts that complement Yale's 
existing collection. If a person wants to 
donate twelve chairs by the same artist, 
the Gallery may negotiate to display two in 
its permanent collection, while selling the 
other ten to create an acquisition fund in 
the donor's name. The museum allocates 
such funds for purchasing art, usually 
in the style that the donor collected. 

The YUAG hopes to parlay its new 
bequests into an :·increased presence in 
the acadeinic life of the University. The 
Gallery has traditionally focused on 
acquiring pieces in areas, like American 
and Asian 
(especially Chinese) 
art, 
especially representative of the strengths 
of the History of Art Department. Since 
Reynolds became Director of the Gallery 
in 1998, however, he has sought to build 
the collection in all areas, encouraging 
curators to strengthen their research 
and address gaps in their collections. 

The Curator of Academic Initiatives, 
a position established in 2004, seeks 
out professors and develops programs 
that take advantage of the new exhibits. 
The YUAG has begun to work with 
faculty from departments ranging from 
Medieval Studies to Gender Studies to 
Anthropology. Language classes now 
include field trips to the Gallery, where 
students practice conversational skills as 
they discuss foreign art. Students from 
the Law School study art law, while School 
of Management students have capitalized 
on Gallery resources to learn about 
the art market. In an exclamation that 
perhaps applies to the Yale University Art 
Gallery's new future as much as it does 
to the new exhibit, Mates on said: ''You 
won't believe what you're going to see."
