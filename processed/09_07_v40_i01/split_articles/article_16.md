Fresh vegetables, sustainable or
not, are important to a healthy
diet, and the market provides a
rare opportunity for lower-income
households to access them. "It's
not just buying food here, it's being
out here," he says, describing the
virtues of CitySeed's endeavor.
"Usually, you think of farmers'
markets as,
frankly,
a yuppie
thing."

That the Fair Haven market
breaks this mold is credit not only
to CitySeed and its donors but
also to a pair of federal programs:
Food Stamps and WIC Checks.
The former, distributed under an
entitlement program established
by the federal government in 197.1,
are no longer issued on paper
but embedded in a swipe card as
an Electronic Benefit Transfer.
25.7 rni11ion Americans receive
a maxirnum of $155 dollars per
person in food stamps each month.
The same wireless technology
that permits wealthy marketgoers
to use their credit cards allows
those closer to the poverty line
to pay for fresh, nutritious food.
September 2007


The CitySeed booth, equipped
with the correct device, allows
customers to spend their food
stamps in exchange for wooden
disks, each the approxirnate size
and exact worth of a silver dollar.
Those tokens are accepted at all
other stalls. CitySeed markets were
the first in the state to accept such
wireless payment and to open its
stalls to those on welfare.
More
prevalent than
food
stamps are WIC checks

Special Supplemental Nutrition
Program for Women, Infants, and
Children. A · grant a
· · stered
by local officials, WIC spends
nearly five billion dollars each year
providing for over eight mi11ion
low-income, nutritionally at-risk
pregnant women, breastfeeding
women, and children through the
age of five. Forty-five percent of
all American children benefit from
the program.

Since 1992, a subset of the
grant has been earmarked for the
WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition
Program, which provides over 2.5
n1illion people with packets of
between five and ten three-dollar
checks that can be redeemed
only for locally-grown produce.
Operative under the USDA in 38
states, the District of Columbia,
Puerto Rico, Guam, and four
Indian tribal organizations, WIC
FMNP allocated $409,879 to more
than fifty thousand Connecticut
residents in 2005.

The program has been criticized
for linuting the choices of those
below the poverty line and forcing
them to purchase uncooked food
· that busy schedules may not allow·
them to prepare. In President
Bush's budget proposal for 2005,
spending for the Farmers' Market
Nutrition Program was cut by
26°/o, to twenty mi11ion dollars-
an action less severe than the
administration's earlier statements
that the
program should be
eliminated entirely.

But WIC checks have survived
their critics and federal budget
cuts . thanks
to
overwhelming
support from the public health
and agricultural communities. Its
advocates condemn the President
and
his
fellow
antagonists
for trumpeting the cause of
agribusiness
money authorized
as WI C checks flows predotninantly
into the pockets of small farmers-
and respond to concerns about
underprivileged
consurners'
Jirnited freedom of choice by
pointing to the comparatively
small amount of money changing
hands
just slightly more than
one-half of one percent of total
WIC spending, to a maxirnum
of thirty dollars per person each
season. In all, the produce and
meat farmers benefiting from the
WIC FMNP programs receive less
than one-tenth of one percent
of the billions of subsidy dollars
the federal government gives to
cereal, fiber, and other conunodity
producers.

Berube says it wouldn't be· a
market without Monahan; he says
it wouldn't be a market without
WIC. He esrirnates that "a good
percentage, ntaybe seventy" of his


income at the Thursday markets
is in WI C checks. His wife agrees,
adding that this is nearly three
times the percentage of other area
markets. The Monahans make sure
that all of their goQds are neatly
priced in multiples of three to ease
the transaction
no ; matter the

language. What's more,? by selling
produce directly to consumers
rather
than
wholesalers,
Monahan and his fellow vendors
are able to offer prices competitive
with local grocery stores and still
make a livable profit. Consul)lers
also benefit, able to eat food gro_wn

food, most recipients are

Though all the produce sold at
Thursday's. markets is Connecticut
grown, it is not entirely organic;
thi's is fine with Neil and the Haven
Free Clinic. "It's vegetables," he
says. "So it doesn't really matter to
me if it's sustainable or not." More
paramount is "food security," an
increasingly widespread term that
describes a community's access
· to an affordable, balanced diet. A
report by the Connecticut Food
Policy Council in 2005 ranked New
Haven 163rd out of 169 cities in
the state and criticized its poor bus
routes for making grocers hard
to reach for the working poor.
CitySeedis fixing the transportation
gap another way, bringing food
from the farmers who need to sell
it to consumers who need to buy
it. Berube says that this season,
they're succeeding. "It's a better
market this year. If we manage to
keep it like this, I'll be happy. And
the community will be happy."
