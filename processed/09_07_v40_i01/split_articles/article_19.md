devoted to the Glass House often depict 
Johnson standing before one of his 
walls, gazing out at his 4 7 acres. From 
this familiar place, he could see Ponus 
Ridge with its stretches of field grass 
and trees. He could see the stout stone 
fence he constructed to line the edge of 
the tumble of boulders and he could see 
the Rippowam Valley. And, imposed on it 
all, he could see his reflection, a portrait 
etched in the glass of the walls of his 
house, a representation of himself as 
he was in the precise moment he stood 
facing the landscape. 

As I looked at these photographs, I 
was reminded of a song I heard once on 
the radio composed of only three lines, 
two of which were Bring a mirror to my 
face/Let all my memories be gone

an anthem for a glass house as I have ever 
heard. 

n a review of the Glass House 
published two weeks after its public 
opening, Nicolai Ouroussoff of the 
Times said that, "What mattered most 
about Johnson might have less to do 
with his gifts as an architect than with 
his intellectual openness ... a willingness 
to test new ideas, to push limits ·to their 
extremes, to stay firmly rooted in the 
present." In the end, the Glass House 
exists mostly as a testament to someone 
who, for all his weaknesses, could always 
make architecture feel wonderfully alive. 
This conclusion is apt. The Glass 
House rooted Johnson in the present, 
allowed him to experience life as it 
evolved within his 4 7 acres, filled him 
with.a satisfaction that could last for days . 
The test of architecture was to build a 
building, go inside, and let it wrap itself 
around you. "When people come into 
my house," Johnson said, "I say, just shut 
up and look around."'

An ingenue considers ta · g the tattoo plunge. 
phone was ringing, ringing~ 
please don't pick up 
ringing, 
ringing ... rigid with . suspense, I 
waited. I bit my lip. I was getting cold 
feet. 

"Studio Zee." Low and jaded, a 
woman's voice cut across my lingering 
apprehension. 

"Oh! Hello ... " I fumbled, tossed out 
my sweetest phone voice. 

"Tattoo or piercing." The response 
was clipped and icy. This was a statement, 
not a question. She was a bore9. traffic 
cop, herding me to the left or the right, 
and she had answered the phone this 
way thousands of times. I somehow 
managed to regain my voice, and, setl ing 
a consultation for 7:30 that evening, I 
snapped my cell phone shut. 

The August sun splashed across the 
office, slicing through the towering stacks 
of volumes and .documents lining the 
walls. Over a hundred footnotes, red 
pens, Post-It flags, and a_ heap of books 
on Dutch courthouses lay scattered in 
familiar chaos over my huge desk. I was 
alone in my summer office, deep within 
the Yale Law School. 

As a research assistant for a law 
professor, I was striving to excel as an 
intellectual. 
I knew the rhythms and 
movements of this high-stakes academic 
game, its strategies and pitfalls, its risks 
and payoffs. I was comfortable in my 
element, armed with 
a 
highlighter, 
reference texts, and rny own drive. 

And yet I was wave~g at the brink of 
an imminent foray into the un.lqlown. 
Convinced of my own insanity, I · said 
to myself, "Tess, tonight you have an 
appoinunent at a 'tattoo parlor."

on the rules of lacrosse and the Hail 
Mary. I spent my days cloistered in an 
all-girls' Catholic school perched on 27 · 
roW.Og green acres of Maryland suburb. 
Afternoons slipped by as I stretched at 
the ballet barre. I did all my homework on 
time, and I never once skipped school. 
I was not popular, I played by the rules, 
and, for two weeks when I was twelve, I 
wanted to be a nun when I grew up. 

Even during high school in the District 
of Columbia, I didn't feel the attraction 
of the unexpected until my senior year. 
I was still a nerd through and through, 
but I broke out a bit on the brink of Yale. 
I ate lunch with boys. I flirted with the 
skater guys and hot shots. I did flamenco 
in the hallways. I used four-letter words in 
my creative writing assignments. During 
spirit week, I came to class dressed in 
black denim and leather. And yet, by 
most standards, I was a shockingly vanilla 
second-semester senior immune to the 
allure of serious rebellion. I successfully 
confused everyone by barely toeing the 
line, and I loved it. 

After I marched dqwn the graduation 
~ 
aisle in crisp white, Yale handed me a 
blank slate and no bridle, so I naturally 
ran a little wild in the costume closet, 
picking and choosing and layering and 
casting off. I slacked off occasional1y, 
stayed out till the wee hours of. the 
morning, cursed to elicit reactions, began 
my weekends midweek. I relished the fact 
that people knew nothing about me and 
fully exploited the opportunity to avoid 
simple definition. Nonetheless,· I never 
went off the deep end. I remained unable 
to relinquish my desire to be in control. 

Truthfully, I barely dipped my toes in 
the rapids. I was in Directed Studies, 
frequently "that sober girl" at Beta, and a 
witness to many long nights erased from 
everyone else's blacked-out memories. 

Impossibly, I have managed to blaze 
. 
through two years at Yale without waking 
up dazed in an unknown bed, arriving hung 
over to a morning seminar, or beginning 
a term p aper the night before. And yet, I 
'never stayed in on T hursday nights, rarely 
even on Wednesdays. What was wrong 
with me? Was I going to utterly lack tales 
of my mischievous college days? What 
was I going to tell my grandchildren? 
That I was occasionally tipsy off cheap 
champagne? I resigned myself to the fact 
that I was still an incorrigibly good girl 
from pony tail to high heels. 

So when I considered permanently 
injecting ink into my mostly pristine life 
this past summer, the idea hit my plaid-
clad, book-hugging self hard. And that, 
of course, is why I couldn't shake it. 

n the evening of my August phone 
call, I revisited the results of my 
Mapquest search: 920 State Street, well 
beyond my stomping grounds and light 
years past my comfort zone. I stood on 
the front porch of my summer apartment 
building on Lynwood, fidgeting as I 
waited 
for the Yale Transportation 
Service. I was minibussing-it to a tattoo 
parlor. I reflected on my clothing choices. 
A navy polo dress, pearl earrings, bronze 
flip flops, a messenger bag with the 
Berkeley Crest. I looked every inch the 
fresh, young, well-kept female off to a 
beach town coffee shop to get in some 
good reading before supper. 

Who did I think I was? I tried to 
visualize myself with my sun-bleached 
locks, scrubbed, moisturized skin, and 
Moleskine notepad strolling into an 
establishmentthatspecializesin permanent 
body art and piercing, whatever, wherever. 
I really, really needed a motorcycle and 
some mean; studded boots. In my mind, 
the place was definitely dark, on a less-
than-inviting street, manned by nocturnal 
individuals who set off metal detectors
