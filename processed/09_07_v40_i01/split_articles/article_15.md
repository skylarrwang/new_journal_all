ummer days afford Fred 
Monahan 
little 
ti rne 
to 
consider the lilies of the field. 
As a dedicated vendor at four New 
Haven farmers' markets, he is too 
busy with the land's othe~, edible 
bounty: the sweetness of corn, the 
firmness of squash, the odor of 
garlic, the length of cucumbers, 
and the lush, juicy ripeness of 
·peaches. Today, he is particularly 
concerned with peppers. And, on 
account of it being Thursday, he 
is out of his element. 

A broad-faced, affable man, 
Monahan is dressed in the satne 
n~vy hoodie and tan overalls that 
he wore to market the day before. 
He and his wife, .Stacia, own 
Stone Gardens Farm, 33 acres 
of sweet corn and vegetables 
in nearby Shelton, CT. Today, 
however, he finds himself in a 
• 
more urban environment. Each 
Thursday in Fair Haven, as Grand 
Avenue prepares to plunge across 
the Quinnipiac River and scale 
the hills of Fair Haven Heights, 
a cluster of white tents and 
a rainbow of picnic blankets 
assemble across· the wide, grassy 
expanse of riverbank. Here, a 
three-year-old 
not-for-profit 
named CitySeed hosts the most 
unusual of its four weekly farmers' 
markets. And here, set against the 
bucolic wooded knolls and white 
steeples of the opposite bank and 
surrounded by a predominantly 
Hispanic neighborhood, Monahan 
is nonplussed. 

Unable to ·speak Spanish, h~ 
says that the language barrier 
at the Fair Haven market "can 
make you want to throw your 
hands up and walk away." He has 
mastered the nurnbers 
through 
twenty, at least 
and the narnes 
of certain vegetables, but is at 
a loss in the face of rarer, more 
complex questions. Confronted 
with an elderly woman who wants 
to know cuantas semanas tienen 
sus habaneras, he can only shake 
his head and observe, dryly, that 
"these markets are very good for 
.. 
. ·.: . 
::•.«' 
-;::\ 
stress management." The age of 
a habanera pepper determines 
how hot it tastes; unable to get an 
answer, the woman is reluctant to 
purchase the small, vibrantly orange 
vegetable. Monahan, though here 
to sell peppers, is not concerned. 
Business at the CitySeed markets is 
regularly brisk; another customer 
will likely buy him out of peppers: 
habanera, bell, and jalapeno. If 
not, he describes how he would 
go about eating them 
slicing 
off the tops, stuffing them with 
prosciutto and provolone from a 
neighboring stall, and marinating 
them in olive oil. ''That's the 
only vegetables we get to eat, the 
ones people don't buy," he says. 
"I haven't eaten a good vegetable 
all 
"A 
. 
sununer. 
passmg customer, 
car 1 ing off a particularly nice set 
of bell peppers, describes hiln as 
"a prince among men." 

CitySeed, 
like 
any 
civic-
tninded not-for-profit, is full of 
such princes. Its three full-ritne 
employees Jennifer McTiernan, 
Benjarnin Gardner, and Nicole 
Berube 
wander 
each 
market, 
their faces exuding cheer from 
behind woven baskets, jars of 
honey, stacks of recipes, and 
• • 
loaves of bread. It is their work, 
and particularly the dedication 
of Berube, the program director 
responsible 
for 
the Thursday 
market, that brings Monahan and 
his pregnant wife to Fair Haven 
week after week. They know that 
underneath this idyll, under the 
mounds of red tomatoes and 
clusters of lettuce, is a struggle for 
the soul of America's food system 
and the health of its inner cities. 

Here in Fair Haven, CitySeed is 
on the front lines of the battle 
for farmers' markets 
a battle 
that pits small farmers, charitable 
foundations, and the inner-city 
poor against the diverse specters 
of agribusiness and urban decay. 
Viewed for thirty years as an icon 
of the liberal bourgeoisie and 
a I 
for the rich, farmers' 
markets are being transformed 
from a symbol of yuppie excess 
to a concrete medium of renewal 
and public welfare. CitySeed's 
three other markets are self-. 
supporting 
the farmers 
make 
enough money each week to 
cover their costs and rirne. But 
here, against the edge of a major 
thoroughfare in a depressed New 
England 
manufacturing 
town,

a novel idea is in the midst of 
its third and strongest season. 

Government spending, charitable 
donations, and a tiny not-for-
profit are giving sm:all farmers 
and low-income city dwellers, the 
widespread underdogs of our rural 
and urban landscapes, the chance 
to help each other out 
and to 
plant, in the midst of the city, the 
seed of a connnunity. 

years before this idea 
took root, Jennifer McTiernan 
stood 
at 
CitySeed's 
inaugural 
market in Wooster Square, the 
city's Italian district. Then, as 
now, she was an upbeat twenty-
something with chestnut hair 
falling straight past her shoulders. 
A graduate of the Yale Class of 
1999 with a B.A. in American 
Studies, she had returned to New 
Haven with a baby daughter, a 
year of experience in an organic 
restaurant, and the determination 
to bring New Haven residents and 
farmers together. On the 17th 
of July, 2004, she was CitySeed's 
founder and sole employee; today 
she is its executive director. As the 
New Haven Register's ''Person of 
the Year 2006," her title, increasing 
visibility, and expanding staff are 
testament to the · organization's 
success. 

At the market on that 
a 
or 
first Saturday, New Haven Mayor 
John DeStefap.o, Jr., a camera 
tearn from News ChannelS, and a 
bevy of excited passersby watched 
as 
CitySeed 
board 
members 
costumed 
plush tomatoes, 
September 2007 
purple eggplants, and ears of corn 
danced in front of vendors from 
seven organic and pesticide-free 
farms. By the end of its first day, 
the market featured many vendors 
who had sold out of produce so. 
early that they . phoned spouses 
or farm hands for emergency 
deliveries. By the end of its first 
season, the market boasted regular 
attendance 
from 
dedicated 
customer base and more than 
15 farmers. New Haven County, 
home to more members of the 
Connecticut Farm Bureau than 
any other in the state, finally had 
the market it deserved. 

· 
Over the course of 2005, the 
Wooster Square market would be 
joined by not only the Fair Haven 
market, but also by start-ups in a 
corner of Edgewood Park and in 
front of City Hall. Each has its 
own flavor, its distinct composition 
of vendors and customers. The 
Wooster Square 
market is 
destination; neighborhood Italians 
and graduate students are joined by 
far-flung shoppers from Hamden 
and Meriden, car keys dangling at 
their hips. Edgewood Park is a more 
local affair, while the downtown 
market lures a more suit-and-tie 
clientele. The vendors know their 
customer base and target the 
appropriate market; there is more 
food to grab and go on Church 
cro 
oun 
Street, more high-end products at 
Wooster Square. While vendors at 
the first CitySeed markets hailed 
from within 25 miles of the city, 
many now spend over an hour 
with their foot on the gas pedal, 
cross-pollinating the Elm City 
with food from farms across the 
Nutmeg State. In Wooster Square, 
Two Guys From Woodbridge sells 
hydroponic microgreens from the 
oldest farm in Hamden. It has been 
joined by Beltane Farm, which 
owns forty goats in Lebanon and 
drives more than sixty miles to sell 
its wool, n1ilk, and fresh chevre in 
New Haven. 

But neither of these farmers 
comes to Fair Haven, where 
customers expect more everyday 
offerings. ''We sell things people 
.regularly cook with all the tirne," 
Berube explains. "They expect 
corn. They expect fruit. Swiss 
chard probably isn't your biggest 
seller here." 

These customer demands make 
the Fair Haven market a bit less 
attractive to farmers. But regardless 
of consumer preference, capable 
vendors at every market can recoup 
ninety cents per dollar spent on 
their goods 
a sight better share 
than what they make selling to 
supermarkets, where a chain of 
middlemen and marketers leave 
farmers to gross only twenty cents 
off every dollar. 

The population of Fair Haven 
has been majority-immigrant for 
most of the previous century, and 
many of the Puerto Ricans and 
Africans who dominate its cultural 
een 
ren 
zn 
landscape 
are 
ill-accustomed 
to farmers' n1arkets, unused to 
New England produce, merely 
proficient at English, and without 
the money to spend on lnxur y 
foods. Their purchases do not 
23

always allow vendors the money 
to justify transportation costs and 
time spent away from the fields. 

To draw farmers to Fair Haven, 
CitySeed has worked to define and 
operate a "community-supported 
market." To bring together two 
groups very much in need of 
other, 
the 
organization 
. coordinates large produce orders 
from local businesses 'to cover 
farmers' operating costs. Each 
week, CitySeed fills boxes with a 
melange of produce from three 
participating farms 
"a good 
number for us," Berube says, "a 
good number for logistics"-
which 
it then 
distributes 
customers who have . arranged in 
advance for a long-term share. It's 
a sort of season ticket. 

In 2006, employees at three 
organiza~ons were targeted for the 
progn;un: Yale's Rudd Center for 
Food Policy and Obesity, the law 
firm Wiggin & Dana, and the Fair 
Haven Community Health Center. 
Together, purchases of ten- . and 
twenty-dollar 
shares . grossed 
$7,111 forCitySeedand the farmers 
at its Fair Haven market. This 
summer, Berube drives the newly-
purchased "CitySeed-mobile" 
gray-green Honda Element with 
peas stenciled on the side 
two more participating offices: a 
group at the Yale Forestry School 
and Junta for Progressive Action, 
a community Latino organization 
and CitySeed's partner at the Fair 
Haven market that offers micro-
loans to neighborhood residents, 
24 
covering the start-up costs of a 
booth to sell jewelry or crafts. She 
is proud of her new infrastructure 
and her snazzy delivery method, 
and, thanks to a higher handling 
fee and increased interest in the 
new 15-dollar shares, expects the 
community-supported market to 
gross even more this year. But, 
Berube says, "I haven't done any 
data gathering yet." She laughs 
· ruefully, a little tired. "That's for 
the end of the season." 

y the time she retires to the 
office and begins crunching 
numbers, Berube will have hosted 
a whole series of events at the 
Fair Haven market. While the 
commuhity-supported 
market 
system 1s an 11novat1ve structure 
responsible · for much of the 
location's success, it is not at 
the heart of her effort. Rather, 
those purchases by the relatively 
well-off are designed to·· ensure 
that farmers .continue coming· to 
Fair Haven and continue selling 
to those who can't afford to 
have a weekly share delivered to 
their office. Their money, along 
with a well-tailored . government 
program and the support of other 
foundations and not-for-profits, 
ensures that the Fair Haven market 
is a worthwhile venture for more 
e 
than the English-speaking vendors 
who frequent it 
the community's 
consumers, too, are busy exploring 
its potential. 

One of the initiatives that 
keeps these customers coming 
back is advertised prominently at 
the booth on a flapping, plastic 
banner, whose blue lettering picks 
out the following message: 
"We gladly accept food stamps/ 
EBT. Get your tokens here. 
((Con mucho gusto aceptamos cupones 
para alimentos / EBT. Obtenga sus 
fiches (tokens) aqui. 
"(Connecticut 
Department 
of Social Services. Caring for 
Connecticut.)" 

This message has been posted 
at each of the week's markets, but 
nowhere is it more important to 
business than in Fair Haven. The 
steady stream of professionals that 
characterized the other markets 
has been· replaced by a crowd of 
complete families, or women with 
young· children in tow. 

The Fair Haven Community 
Health Center, one of the three 
organizations participating in the 
community-supported 
. market, 
contributes to this market r in 
other ways: its patrons are often 
marketgoers. The Haven Free 
Clinic, 
collaborative 
project 
of Yale undergraduates, medical 
students, and the Center, has run a 
booth at the Thursday markets and 
taken children on tours. Providing 
information rather than selling 
goods, Neil Desai, Med. '09, has 
tempted kids with crayons or an
