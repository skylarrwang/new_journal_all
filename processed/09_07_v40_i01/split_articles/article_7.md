**Newton's Kettle Corn**
**Page number(s): 4-5**

FROM THE SOUND OF HIS NAME, NEWTON 
Carroll III could be a federal judge or a 
member of the British Royal family, but 
he presides over neither a palace .nor 
any court of law. .Carroll's domain is a 
· street corner in downtown New Haven 
from which, for the past three years, he 
has been selling his own variety of kettle 
corn. Here, he reigns supreme 
the 
. only vendor on his side of the street. 

Across the way, in the delta where 
medical school students, doctors, and 
hospital staff empty out of Yale-New 
Haven Hospital for lunch, food vendors 
abound. Steam and smoke rise up from 
shining metal carts; sweat pours down 
from the arms and faces of vendors; 
swells of scrubs-clad customers clog 
the sidewalks; shouted orders mingle 
with the clink of tendered change 
and the occasional wail of a siren. 

Spotl ing easy pickings in over-zealous 
kernels that pop their way straight onto 
the sidewalk, birds are the most clamorous 
customers 
around 
Carroll's 
eclectic 
cart. Painted in primary colors, printed 
with the words, 'cprotected by God's 
Hands," and sporl ing a pink-orange-and 
white-striped deck umbrella, the cart 
was built by Patricia Carroll when she 
and her husband founded the Elm City 
Kettle Corn Company in June of 2004. 
Their treat will soon be available away 
from the cart and free from the birds. 
When the renovated 
Cross 
• 
Six by nine feet in footprirtt, the 
cart Patricia 
built is 
fashioned of 
wooden boards and 2x4s. 
Mounted 
onto its base is a large box that houses 
a 
propane~fired . flame. The stainless 
steel bowl that is Newton's kettle sits 
sunken into the box's hinged lid, which, 
when opened, causes the kettle to dump 
1ts contents mto an enormous copper 
container called "the bin." From here, 
Newton bags and serves his kettle corn. 

Kettle corn 
shares 
its 
essential 
ingredient with popcorn, . though it 
bears very little relationship to the too-
yellow, cheap-smelling, "I Can't Believe 
It's Not Butter" -saturated variety one 
finds in movie theaters. 
Perhaps best 
characterized as a confection, kettle corn 
is popcorn popped with sugar and hot 
oil until a thin, caramelized crust forms 
over the burst kernel, then sprinkled 
generously with salt. Sweet and salty, 
bite-size and slightly crunchy, kettle corn 
might just be the perfect snack food. 
Carroll's customers certainly think so. 

On a good day, Carroll can sell as many 
as one hundred three- and five-dollar 
bags of kettle corn. 
On the sidewalk 
and in the road beside his cart, people 
and cars line up to wait for service. And 
according to one woman who bought a 
large bag as she was leaving work, "the 
hospital people swear by this stuf£" 

Carroll has only recently become a 
kettle corn aficionado, but his skill and 
finesse on the job come from years of . 
popping at home. To hear him tell the 
story of Elm City Kettle Corn, selling 
popcorn was a simple, almost obvious 
choice. ''I just like popcorn," he says, 
-
explaining how he used to make it at 
home, "and evetybody says how good it 
is." Reca11ing how highly his coworkers 
used to praise the popcorn Carroll 
brought them, and seeing her recently 
retired husband "at loose ends," Patricia 
suggested he sell the confection. A few 
internet searches later, the two of them 
had discovered the kettle corn business, 
found a man in Alabama who was selling 
his equipment, driven south to pick it up, 
and set to work. Now, Carroll pops kettle 
corn· every weekday from noon to five. 

Though 
enthusiasm 
for 
his new job is contagious, there are few 
other retirees who would choose to 
spend their free time risking constant 
burns over a huge pot of hot oil and 
bursting corn kernels. Newton must 
don protective gear for ·his hands and 
arms 
gl~ves and what look like arm 
socks that reach from his Wrists past 
his elbows 
before making each batch. 

Suited up, and wearing a bright yellow 
"Elm City Kettle Corn Co." shirt, a blue 
apron, and a Yankees cap, Newton looks 
like something of. an ailachronism as he 
stirs the corn with both hands; gripping 
a three-foot-long wooden rod that might 
well be the end of a sawn-off broom 
handle. His feet planted wide, his arms 
working in clockwise circles, he recalls one's 
childhood visions of witches bent over 
boiling potions in dark, enchanted woods. 

But there is nothing magical about 
Newton's brew, and his recipe is no secret: 
three cups vegetable oil to two cups corn 
and one cup sugar, with salt to taste. 
The cooking instructions are equally 
straightforward: 
heat oil in the kettle, 
add corn and sugar, stir until the rapid-
fire staccato of bursting kernels beating 
against the sides of a steel pot subsides, 
add salt, allow to cool, serve. Nonetheless, 
Carroll will allow no apprentices 
he 
does all the preparation himself. "I'm 
very particular about the way it comes 
out," he explains. 'CVery particular." 

Even as Elm City Kettle Corn begins to 
expand its operations, Carroll will continue 
to man the kettle. But what will happen 
if he is suddenly faced with a de111and for 
thousands of bags a day? Selling to Yale 
could be the first step toward puu ing his 
kettle corn on the shelves of local shops. 
Even if such expansion is years away, 
Library Cafe may soon be knocking on 
the Carrolls' door, asking . for more. Will 
Carroll still spend time at his homemade 
. 
cart, 
trading 
popcorn 
stories? 
On this point, his regulars needdt 
worry. For Newton and his wife, selling 
to Yale is a boon, a sign of God's 
providence. But only misfortune; never 
felicity, could cause Carroll to leave his 
York Street customers. Of the corner 
on which he has spent most of his 
afternoons for three years, Carroll says: 
"This is home; these are all my friends.''
