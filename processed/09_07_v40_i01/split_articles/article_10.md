Whidock with a very different issue. -
She'd been dating someone new, and 
though things weren't serious yet, she had 
thought they were starting to take off. 
When her boyfriend asked her to loan him 
sixty thousand dollars, she agreed. Shortly 
thereafter, as Whitlock pithily puts it, "he 
screwed her and took off." Whidock has 
been charged with the daunting task of 
tracking down the runaway beau. 

Often, insurance companies ask him 
to monitor employees who have allegedly 
been injured so badly on the job that they 
are seeking compensation. In such cases, 
he has videotaped "gravely injured" 
employees waterskiing, playing 18 holes 
of golf, or up on ladders painting houses. 
Whidock often has to testify in court. 
Sometimes, people get angry. ''You think 
about the danger," he says. "But I'm 
trained to use firearms and I have a gun. 
I'm a brown belt in karate. And there's 
always pepper spray if you need it." 

Compared to Whitlock's childhood 
heroes, his investigative tactics are fairly 
standard: 
internet 
research, 
special 
databases, surveillance, which generally 
includes 
videotaping 
and 
following 
people. According to Whitlock, ''It's all 
pretty old-fashioned. Being in the right 
place at the right time. Sometimes nothing 
will happen all day." Other days, he says, 
he'll be out tailing people, making sure 
they don't know they're being followed. 
"Tailing someone is really an art," he 
adds. Tracing devices are a legal grey 
area, so he stays away from them. But he 
does use night-vision goggles and certain 
specialized cameras, which he describes 
with boyish gusto as "all the little toys 
which make it fun." 

Whidock's 
exploits 
have 
attracted 
some -local attention. Several years ago, 
The Newtown Bee ran an article outlining 
Whidock's successful mission to track 
down the girlfriend of a dead soldier. 
In the photograph, he poses at a 
cluttered desk, hands clasped solemnly 
over mounds of- paperwork. With his 
lopsided smile, button-down shirt, and 
wire-rimmed glasses, he looks every inch 
the suburban dad 
which, in fact, he is. 

Whitlock has two sons and one daughter, 
all of whom are already out of the house. 
His voice swells with pride as he describes 
his daughter 
she works in a nursing 
home, "just brightening people's lives"-
his younger son studying to be a surveyor, 
and his eldest son, who now runs his own 
private investigation business in Rhode 
Island. 

At 55 years old, Whitlock is salt-and-
pepper-haired, somewhat paunchy, not 
quite the smooth-talking, sharp-shooting 
FBI agent that he once imagined. But he 
has worked Â·long and hard at this business 
of intrigue and inquiry, and has managed 
to forge a career for himself that is 
somewhat in line with the aspirations of 
his youth. His biggest challenge has been 
competing with national investigative 
agencies that have a much broader reach 
and impact. Whitlock's small enterprise is 
holding its own, though he worries that 
competition will grow stiffer. "It's kind 
of like how the big supermarkets come 
in and force the mom and pop markets 
out of business." He pauses and exhales, 
pondering. "But," he says with a smile, "I 
guess they call that progress."
