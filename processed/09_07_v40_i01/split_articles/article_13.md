Province website, too." Even outside the 
academic bubble, the Masons are making 
an unprecedented push for recruitment. 
"There's a big fancy website, radio ads," 
points out Rosen. "There's a TV ad with 
Benjamin Franklin saying 'You can help 
your country. 
· Additionally, 
the 
Masons 
have 
streamlined ascendancy within 
their 
ranks-which move up by numbered 
degrees-by accelerating the process of 
awarding degrees. "There was one time 
when I had to memorize a dialogue to 
move up," recalls Rosen. ''But once I got 
to the rneeting they didn't make me recite 
it, and I advanced anyway." Rosen was 
somewhat disappointed by the experience 
and 
he 
recognized 
its 
underlying 
contradiction: To make the order more 
palatable · to prospective members, the 
Gloucester 
Freemasons 
had 
opted 
to downplay the very rituals that had 
attracted the Harvard sophomore to the 
organization in the first place. In order 
to reach a larger audience, the lodge had. 
pulled back the veil of secrecy that many 
young initiates view as their impetus for 
joining. "I had always been interested 
in secret-society type things 
having 
something I couldn't tell people about, but 
at the same time helping people through 
philanthropy," explains Rosen. For him, 
the ongoing change-of-face within the 
Masonic community seemed out of step 
with the group's intrinsically mysterious 
appeal. An oft-repeated mantra of the 
fraternity, one quoted abundantly in the 
press and alluded to by Rosen, sums up 
the Freemasons' public image for the 
new century: ''We're not a secret society, 
we're a society with secrets." 


William Greene, the Grand Master 
of the Grand Lodge of Connecticut, 
echoes this sentiment. Responsible for 
overseeing the conduct and organization 
of Masonic communities throughout the 
state, Greene describes the current order 
as a charity rather than an underground 
association of arcane rituals and covert 
gatherings. 
Today, 
donate $2 mVJ.ion a day to philanthropic 
causes across the country, raising money 
and awareness for diabetes and cancer 
patients in addition to supporting a host 
of renowned medical facilities. ''We 
have a few secrets, but they're more like 
personal things," notes Greene, who has 
been a member of the fraternity for over 
thirty years. "Even from the beginning, 
the Masons were community-minded. 
The biggest difference is that now we talk 
about it, and before we didn't." According 
to the Grand Master, the group's 
newfound transparency is beginning to 
pay of£ "In the last two years, there's 
been a huge turnaround," he explains. 
"This is the definite start of a surge in 
membership." While Greene says that he 
hasn't explicitly reached out to colleges a.s 
a source of new blood, the organizatior. 
has begun to make extensive use of .e 
internet as a source of informatio 
r 
interested parties. ''Young people s us 
online and appreciate our moral 
d 
our civic-minded agenda," continu. the 
Grand Master. 'We don't actively recruit 
new members, but the website gives 
students a· chance to reach out to us and 
ask us, 'What's this about?' A majority of 
our new members aren't coming from 
Masonic families, as was traditionally 
the case, but from a personal interest in 
what we do." 


But do the benevolent 
and perhaps 
surprisingly public 
behaviors of the 
real-life Masons gel with the expectations 
of youthful inductees, raised on the 
fabulist tales of Nicholas Cage and Dan 
Brown? Greene, for one, pinpoints the 
present generation of Freemasons as 
unusually well-informed. "The younger 
members coming to us today are used to 
finding things out about our organization 
before they ask," he relates. "They know 
so much more about it from the internet 
and research they've conducted on their 
own." Indeed, the process by which Rosen 
became a Freemason reflects Greene's 
account almost exacdy. As no one in his 
immediate family was affiliated with the 
order, the student looked into his local 
lodge independent of adult influence, 
eventually asking his car mechanic about 
joining. "He probably told me a bit more 
than he should have," Rosen recalls. 
"But he ended up sponsoring me when 1 
applied for membership." 


Still, Rosen's self-motivated approach 
to Freemasonry is hardly typical. Within 
collegiate lodges the process of inquction 
is inevitably more peer-oriented, with the 
order drawing membership from a pre-
existing academic and social community. 
"Membership of the University Lodge 
is open only to matriculated members 
of Oxford University," explains Bourne-
Taylor. "In truth, such discrimination is 
contrary to the spirit of Freemasonry, but 
informal rules usually work out for the 
best. It is common knowledge that like 
groups attract. Within the lodge, we see 
this happening, too, as one new member 
will encourage the other members of 
the boat crew to join.'~ But despite this 
group mentality, Freemasons insist_ that 
they foster the individualism of younger, 
tech-savvy 
gen~rations 
they 
simply 
want to provide them with a venue for 
old-fashioned male-bonding. Above all, 
the group has made a name for itself as 
a cotlltJ}unity of exceptional individuals. 
''I just got back from a conference in 
September 2007 
in Washington, D.C.," remarks Greene, 
"and I was sitting a table away from Buzz 
Aldrin and John Glenn. All these great 
people· were Masons, but they didn't talk 
about it. Now, people are becoming more 
aware of the history of our organization." 


Rosen, on the other hand, feels that the 
Freemasons' lack of elitism correlates 
direcdy with their appeal: "They'll pretty 
much accept anyone unless they're a 
convicted rapist." 


Bourne-Taylor emphasizes a slighdy 
different angle: "I think that, in the 
changing world in which we live, Masonry 
is still very much a cardinal point whence 
students can take their bearings. It is 
that well-loved book that orte can take 
from the shelf, read with pleasure from 
a well-thumbed page, and replace, to 
be waiting for one's next opportUnity, 
that disinterested friendship that has 
nothing to prove and does not place 
barriers of religion or politics between 
its members. Its ritual seems to fascinate 
these clever young men; they are a joy to 
see and hear." 


It is important not to overstate the 
presence of undergraduates within the 
larger Masonic community 
Bourne-
Taylor concedes that students probably 
account for only a "miniscule proportion" 
of the Grand Lodge of . England but 
burgeoning 
influence 
on 
venerable society is beginning to take 
effect. "I'm hoping that some of these 
y~ung people like what we do and say 'I'd 
like to be associated with these men,"' 
says Greene. "I hope that this is the start 
of a tsunami of new members joining the 
Masons."
