the Glass House. Every flower knew its 
proper position in 'the vase." 
The Glass House was the last in 
which Johnson lived, but certainly not the 
first. He spent his childhood summers 
in an Ohio country house of the Greek 
Revival style where his mother projected 
"lantern" slides of Italian paintings upon 
the walls to educate her children about 
art: When Johnson enrolled at Harvard 
in 1920, he continued to impose art 
upon walls, hanging reproductions of 
Simone Martini and Piero della Francesca 
around his dorm room. He remained· an 
undergraduate longer than most 
seven 
years 
due to a nervous breakdown, after 
which a Boston neurologist advised him 
to "take six months" and return home to 
Ohio, where he read two detective stories 
a day between tears. 

Johnson took the six months, returned 
to school, and completed his degrees in 
philosophy and G reek only to re-enroll at 
Harvard in 1940, this time at its Graduate 
School of Design, where he conceived 
and constructed a house on Cambridge's 
Ash Street for his graduate thesis. It 
was composed of a wooden rectangle 
covering half the lot and one glass wall 
28 
. 
that enclosed the front garden in such a 
way as to make it appear part of the living 
room. 

As this house was not merely a project 
but a home in which to live, Johnson 
erected a nine-foot wall between it and 
the street for privacy, a move that upset 
his neighbors and provoked unsuccessful 
lawsuits requesting its removal. Many 
people disliked the Ash Street house. 
Even Johnson admits, "People felt that 
it didn't jibe with the street, and they 
were right 
it didn't." But the parties 
he threw there, replete with fine drinks, 
hors d' oeuvres, and high conversation, 
were grand enough to triumph over the 
criticism and the house itself attractive 
enough to sell for 24,000 dollars, the 
approximate cost of its construction. 

Following design school graduation 
and 
the 
sale of the 
Ash 
Street 
home, Johnson moved to 751 Third 
Avenue, a small house in Manhattan that 
he had rented in 1939 and in which his 
younger sister, Theodate, had lived after 
his return to Cambridge. (I'heodate 
affectionately 
dubbed 
7 51 
"Hidden 
House," because of its location behind a 
row of apartment buildings fronting the 
street.) 

In the late 1940s, Johnson, desiring a 
break from city life, searched for property 
·· in New Canaan, a Connecticut suburb. 
The five acres to which a local realtor 
directed him were part of Ponus Ridge-
" a nearly impenetrable tangle of woods, 
·mostly of second and third growth 
relieved by an occasional stretch of field 
grass and some older trees," which sloped 
gently downward from the road. The 
land stood on the edge of a tumble of 
boulders, beyond which lay a vast view 
of the Rippowam Valley. Within an hour 
of his first visit to the site, Johnson had 
walked down from the road, reached 
the field grass, surveyed the valley, and 
bought the five acres. 

ohnson's five acres have since grown 
to 47~ The stretch of field grass now 
a brick guest house, a pool, a lake 
pavilion, painting and sculpture galleries, 
a concrete and aluminum entrance gate, 
' 
and a library which houses Johnson's 
collection of architecture books. It 
includes a number of small pavilions-a 
"Ghost House" composed completely of 
chain-link, a tower 35 feet tall inspired by 
Balanchine choreography and named for 
Ijncoln Kirstein (to dirnb it, one observer 
noted, "you have to choreograph your 
own dance''), a gatehouse composed of 
red and black "warped" blocks called "Da 
Monsta" and 
the site's namesake 
Glass House. The property, recently 
labeled a National Trust Historic Site, 
opened to the public in June. Over five 
hundred guests attended the Inaugural 
Gala Picnic, which included an open 
house, gourmet lunch, and performance 
by The Merce Cunningham Dance 
Company. 

All 4 7 acres are now collectively 
called the Philip ohnson Glass House, 
but the transparent structure remains a 
single room built by Johnson in 1949. It 
is 56 feet long and 32 feet wide, the space 
defined by a floor, a flat roof, and four 
walls made entirely of glass. Steel coluniils 
at each corner and at the center of the 
house's long sides allow for a pristine 
· interior. Excluding these piers, the only 
element that obstructs one's latitudinal 
view is a cylindrical brick structure, 
which occupies a protninent spot in the 
northeast corner and protrudes slightly

above the roof. One half of it contains 
a bathroom, the other a fireplace. The 
cylinder divides th~ "liv,ing room" and 
"kitchen" 
a head-high cabinet and table-
higit&gljlnt-e; 
~rqm, the "bedroom," also 
located ,~~ the house's northern end. The 
Glass I;fouse contains only two works of 
art: a sculpture of two women by Elie 
N adelman displayed near the kitchen 
and "The Death of Phocion," a painting 
by Nicolas Poussin on an easel by the 
fireplace. It was, from 1949 until his death 
in 2905, Johnson's weekend and then 
primarY. residence and has been hailed by 
l 
many ~ince its construction as one of the 
greatest architectural achievements of 
the twentieth century. 

hroughout the complex, one senses 
the strict routine by which Johnson 
and Whitney lived. Nothing was ever out of 
place in the Glass House. It was all of a piece. 
According to biographer Franz Schulze, 
Johnson only permitted slight changes 
to tl}f; _ ,Pl~cement of items and furniture 
inside the house once he had set them 
down. The dining room table remains 
where it stood when he first entertained 
at it; the writing desk where it stood-when 
he first wrote at it; and the bed where it 
stood when he first slept in it. Even when 
reading, Johnson would not move "as 
much as a pillow to prop up his head." 
Anecdotes such as this surround the 
Glass House, reiterating the constancy 
of the place. There is the story of the 
guest who, without thought, dropped her 
handbag on the table-high counter and 
was prompdy scolded: ''You can't put that 
there!" There is the tale, told by biographer 
Hilary Lewis, of the 
photographer 
who moved some objects 
an ashtray, 
a 
malachite 
box 
around Johnson's 
Barcelona Table during a photo shoot 
to achieve a better shot. The story goes 
that Whitney walked quietly over to the 
table and moved the ashtray and the box 
back to their original positions. "Johnson 
nodded to the photographer and said, 'I 
think it's better."' 

These stories paint Johnson as stiff, an 
obsessive who would not tolerate any way 
but his own. Yet his house was anything 
but lift;less and severe. Other narratives, 
~ 
thos,~. of friends closest to him, portray 
Johnson as full of humor and possessed 
of distinct taste. To his neighbor and 
September 2007 
writer Fran Lebowitz, he was "a big lover 
of ·gossip and wit and other people's 
problems." To artist Frank Stella, he was 
"ferociously entertaining," and to Port 
Draper, the engineer responsible for 
maintaining his property, "the most fun 
person I ever worked for." They knew 
the Johnson who thiew a good party. The 
Johnson who hosted weekend lunches 
for up to 14 and whose frequent visitors 
included Andy Warhol and Jasper Johns. 
The Johnson who invited the Velvet 
Underground over to jam, and who 
pissed off the neighbors when the music · 
grew too loud. The Johnson who, on the 
stormy New Canaan night that a branch 
crashed through his wall, shattering glass 
and allowing rain to pour in over his head, 
sat stunned and blinking in his chair, then 
laughed. 

onsider one of Johnson's own stories: 
'--" At the age of 13, he accompanied 
his mother to France and saw Chartres 
Cathedral 
one of his "great architectural 
experiences" along with the Parthenon 
and Kyoto's Ryoanji Temple. "There 
was a funeral going on," he told Calvin 
Tomkins of The New Yorker. "I was so 
moved I don't know why I wasn't dead." 
This was, however, only the first of many 
occasions on which Johnson was moved 
by architecture. Throughout his career, 
he sought to recapture that pathos with 
every design and structure he devised. 
"To be in the presence of a great work 

a focus on functionalism, a movement 
characterized by a break from ornamental 
historicism,_ the use of new technologies 
and building materials like glass and 
reinforced concrete, the insistence of 
"structural integrity," - and the notion 
that a building's form must follow its 
function. Johnson delineated these rules 
himself, first in a 
193~ exhibit at the 
Museum of Modern Ait titled "Modern 
Architecture," and then in The International 
Style: Architecture Since 1922, a book he 
authored that same year with architectural 
historian Henry Russell Hitchcock, which 
gave the subsequent movement its name. 

" 
Later, when he stopped preaching 
the art and started to practice it, he 
sang a decidedly different tune. Johnson 
determined that architecture should be 
created not to serve a functional purpose 
but to evoke a feeling. In 1977, he told 
Tomkins that he was "beginning to think 
that maybe the terms 'form' and 'function' 
were always meaningless." "What is 
function in Chartres?" he asked. ''When 
the people come in and see the .high altar, 
with the ceiling over a hundred feet up, 
and experience all that religious emotion, 
is that aesthetics or is it function?" 

He told Charlie Rose, in a special 
interview to mark his ninetieth birthday, 
that architecture at its best should 
exhilarate people as a symphony does. 
When you listen to a great symphony, 
he explained, you feel "you could float, 
but you can't analyze why." The test of

nson cone. u e J 
of architecture is such a satisfaction that 
you can go hungry for days," Johnson 
said. "To create a feeling such as wine in 
Chartres Cathedral when I was thirteen is 
the aim of architecture." 

There was a degree to which Johnson 
always infused architecture with ontology, 
a reasonable approach for a scholar of 
philosophy and classics who committed 
himself to the arts late in the game. And 
yet for all his philosophical influences, 
Johnson broke into the profession with 
• zn t e tumm '' 
architecture was equally intuitive: "build 
a building, go inside and let it wrap itself 
around you." A 
visceral connection 
should transpire between an individual 
and the place he inhabits. "What more 
could you ask of architecture," Johnson 
concluded, but to "feel very good in the 
tummy.''

American Art wrote the following about 
Johnson's famous home: "The successful 
occupant of the Glass House or any 
other pristine, severe, and hyperorganized 
environment lives in the house in perfect 
4armony with its formal configuration 
and artistic meaning." I think it's better, 
Johnson said, when the ashtray and 
box were moved back to their original 
positions on the table: words spoken by 
an occupant in perfect harmony with the 
formal configuration and artistic meaning 
of his home.

When I read that quotation in the 
Times this past June, I recalled a slow 
summer afternoon I spent talking with 
my grandmother in which she asked how, 
if I followed through with my intention 
30 
to clean my closet of all my old dresses, 
would I remember where I had come 
from. This seemed an odd question at. 
the time, but I see now it was not. She 
had sewn my past into fabric, considered 
these clothes material artifacts, physical 
reminders of who I once was. She wanted 
to ensure .that the person I had become 
did not lose touch with the person I had 
been. 

asse 
unique point, one in which the necessity 
to retain ties to the past becomes 
undesirable or irrelevant and the decision 
to let it all go seems a wiser, cathartic 
alternative. The Glass House was and 
remains devoid of clutter. The way in 
which Johnson chose to live there-

from his own narrative. He relinquished
