n a ridge in New Canaan stands
a house where the light shoots
straight through. This past June,
the New York Times dedicated a quarter
of its «House & Home" section to this
Glass House, a <2onnecticut landmark in
which architect Philip Johnson and his
partner David Whitney lived for over half
a century. The article, entitled «Behind
the Glass Wall: Memories of life and
death in an architectural masterwork,"
consisted largely of personal accounts
from guests Johnson had entertained in
the house during the years he lived there.
They included that of Barbara Jakobson,
a trustee of the Museum of Modern
Art, who remembered that "there was
a certain ritualistic aspect to visiting the
Glass House. The greeting; to the lunch;
the walk; the finish, so Philip could
take his nap and work. You always felt
welcome, and you always knew when it
was over."

They included that of architect Frank
Gehry. c'It made sense: their activity, their
dress, the room and the site, it all had a
symbiotic relationship that was uncanny.
It was grand and generous and eloquent,
and all of a piece."

Another visitor, another memory.
