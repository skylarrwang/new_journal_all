jobs to New Haven residents, in a city 
where "in some neighborhoods, the 
unemployment rate is above 20 per-
cent, while an additional 40 percent or 
more of adults are no longer even look-
ing for jobs," according to the Poverty 
Commission's 1984 report. In fact 
more than two-thirds of the full 
Shubert staff live outside the city. The 
vast majority of the house staff workers 
from the city are elderly or members of 
the Urban Youth League, and are vol-
unteers. Only half the full list of ern: 
ployees work for each show; the other 
half are temporarily laid ofC 
Second, the Shubert brings up the 
issue of gentrification. "While New 
Haven's powerful heap praise on Uoell 
Schiavone," wrote Paul Bass in the 
June 1983 New Haven Magazine, "others 
-like the tenants he evicted (in 1982) 
from the El Dorado Apartments on 
Chapel Street so he could fix the place 
up and charge higher rents-don't. He 
refused to give them any money or 
help in finding new houses until legal 
aid lawyers took him. to court." The 
same thing happened again with other 
apartments Schiavone wanted to 
rehabilitate. 
"Progress hurts minority, low-in-
come people," said prominent real 
estate developer Schiavone in the 
same issue of New Haven Magazine, 
"and when you get down to it, we're in 
the real estate business, and not in the 
business of solving social problems ... 
Unfortunately, the economics mean 
that downtown areas should be the 
most expensive real estate, not the 
cheapest. But it hurts (the poor] and 
it's too bad." 

Gentrification is also an issue in 
Yale's commercial and housing real 
estate. The University owns most of 
the commercial properties near cam-
pus, including Naples, WaWa, The 
Blossom Shop, Rosey's Cleaners, all 
the stores under the Center for British 
An on Chapel Street, and many others 
along Broadway, Elm, York, Park, 
Wall, Church, Chapel and Edwards 
Streets. 
"Over the years, Yale has acquired 
these so that the nature of retail

or even trickle from 
the Shubert.

business stays small 
and oriented 
toward the University," said Buckman. 
These stores cater particularly to Yale 
students' tastes, which account for the 
disproportionate number sellin g ice 
cream, cookies and Yale clothing. 
The University has purchased and 
renovated many dwellings in New 
Haven for the specific use of Yale 
students and faculty. Buckman called 
Yale's efforts to renovate housing 
facilities along Dwight, H owe and 
Park streets in the Chapel Street com-
mercial area "an example of how an in-
stitution can contribute to the com-
munity with its own investments in 
mind." 
Marcia Ryan, director of Yale's real 
estate office, said one of Yale's recent 
housing projects - the Lake and Dix-
well Development- "renovated 
the 
area from one of prostitutes and drugs 
to 23 units of nice apartments rented 
out to the Yale community." 
First Ward alderwoman Janet 
Stearns, '84, who lives on Lake Place, 
points out that building nice houses 
does not make prostitutes and drugs 
disappear. "Yale is certainly gentrify-
ing the area. That's a fact. Yale is 
pushing back poverty on my block but 
is not dealing with the people who are 
there, whom I have to pass every day 
on my way to or from home. The 
worst problem Yale faces right now is 
dealing with poverty and crime in New 
Haven. One of the major reasons why 
people tell you they won't come to Yale 
is New Haven." 
Buckman thought it unlikely that 
Yale would invest in projects such as 
low-cost housing for the New Haven


community: "I don't think we've ever 
done anything concerned that directly 
with community interest, and I would 
doubt that we ever would. We do have 
investment criteria for this money. It's 
not money that is just sitting there and 
can be invested with no return." 
"I don't think Yale's investments are 
all that locked in," said Reverend 
Charles King of Immanuel Baptist 
Church in New Haven and a Yale 
Divinity School graduate. "Yale cer-
tainly .could shift more of its in-
vestments into New Haven than it has 
without threatening its income." 
Halsey denied that Yale should take 
leadership resp0nsibility in changing 
New Haven. "To say that any large 
employer has the responsibility to 
change the life of the city by changing 
the life of its citizens is just not part of 
its mission." Yet' the University's very 
presence in New Haven changes the 
lives of its citizens. Although Yale pays 
taxes on only a small part of its 
holdings in the city, it brings culture, 
jobs and thousands of people, with 
purchasing power in the millions of 
dollars, to New Haven throughout the 
year. 
"Yale's 
relations with the New 
Haven community are very good," 
said Maureen Murphy, assistant direc-
tor of Yale's Community and State 
Relations Office. "They aren't perfect, 
but they're very strong. Only a small 
group sees Yale as something else that 
they don't really like. Others see it as a 
positive influence." 
Stearns disagrees. "I think that 
there's a lot of underlying bitterness in 
the community which shows itself in 
different forms." 
It will be a long time before Yale 
resolves, if it ever does, its roles as a 
private educational institution and as a 
leading citizen of New Haven. Said 
Buckman, "There's some amount that 
Yale ought to be prepared to invest in 
New Haven as a member of this city. I 
don't know what that investment is. 
We are trying to determine it. It 
varies. It tends to move very slowly 
over time."
