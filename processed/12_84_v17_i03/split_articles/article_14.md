jeans and workboots. Dillon recalled the 
time in 1980 when he first attended an 
IE rally in Scotland, Connecticut, 
where he heard Bill Wilkinson speak. 
"It wasn't a band of people running 
around in sheets at night lynching peo-
ple. I didn't hear any hate talk or 
anything like that. What I did hear was 
patriotism, conservative values, preser-
ving the rights of white people, but not 
at the expense of anybody else's Con-
stitutional rights. It's equal rights for 
everyone, and I hadn't heard too many 
other groups saying that. I've been ac-
tive in it ever since." 

Dillon was most concerned about 
issues like affirmative action and racial 
quotas, 
which 
he 
labels 
special 
privileges for minorities. The Great 
Titan b~tterly recalled losing a job as an 
apprenttce carpenter during a company 
lay-off to a black co-worker who seldom

showed up for work. "Some people call 
it reverse discrimination. I just call it 
discrimination." 

According to Dillon, the IE is chiefly 
a political group whose attitudes toward 
issues such as affirmative action, racial 
quotas and forced busing are shared by 
the Republican Party and President 
Reagan. "We like Mr. Reagan very 
much," Dillon stated. "We endorsed 
him for President in 1980 and we en-
dorsed him again in 1984. In 1980 he 
immediately disavowed our endorse-
ment but in 1984 it took him two weeks 
and a threat of a Justice Department in-
quiry for him to denounce it." 

Dillon believes Klan support was 
partially responsible for Reagan's vic-
tory. "I think in general people whose 
beliefs are similar to ours have helped 
R eagan. In 1980 most of the white peo-
ple voted for Reagan and an over-
whelming majority of the blacks voted 
for Carter. When I went to see Reagan 
speak at Fairfield I could practically 
close my eyes and be at a Klan rally. He 
speaks out very clearly on everything 
we say." 

Klansman Dillon resents the IE's 
violent reputation, saying "The Klan is 
a 
fraternal, 
political organization 
dedicated to promoting patriotism and 
the Constitutional rights of white peo-
ple. We're not a violent organization at 
all. Violence doesn't solve problems it 
m~es them worse." 

Much of the Klan's notoriety, Dillon 
believes, 
is due 
to 
media bias. 
"Reporters come and say 'Isn't your 
group anti-Catholic?' 'No,' I'll say, 'I'm 
Catholic, the Grand Dragon's Catholic, 
probably 75 percent of the members in 
Connecticut are Catholic.' Then they'll 
go ahead and print 'The Klan, a 
notorious anti-Catholic, anti-Jewish, 
anti-black organization ... ' In one ear 
and out the other. They print what they 
want." 

Because of this, a principal function 
of the IE in Connecticut is to educate 
people about the Klan through public 
rallies and Klan literature. The IE occa-
sionally distributes literature to students 
at schools such as Harnden High, and 
has also shown up in Groton to support 
the Trident submarine launchings. 
Dillon explained, "We don't like being 
secretive because if you're running 
around being secretive you're not get-
ting anything done. You can get a lot 
more done if you're out in the open.'' 

Dillon became most passionate when 
speaking about anti-Klan forces in 
Connecticut. "It's not so much that anti-
Klan groups help us, they discredit 
themselves. They're out there scream-
ing 'The Klan's a bunch of racist 
murderers' and throwing rocks at us." 

For the Klan leader, the march at 
Meriden proved this. "' hope I never 
see anything happen like that again. 
Everything was fme until they got up on 
the high ground with knapsacks full of 
bricks, chunks of concrete, bottles, just 
about everything. And they just started 
throwing the stuff down. I've never seen 
so much stuff raining out of the sky at 
once. They were ripping up peoples'

watching themselves 
on TV." 

porches . . . cars were attacked and 
windows smashed. We had one Klans-
lady hit in the head with a chunk of con-
crete and she almost died. It caved in 
her skull. They had to remove bone 
splinters from her head; she's got a steel 
plate now. This is in the name of 
brotherhood and love and justice. We 
had several Klan members at the time 
who were armed, but we didn't even 
pull any weapons because ! NCAR was 
out in the crowd. But if Pd seen who 
was throwing the rocks I would have 
shot them." 

Dillon predicted the IE will soon be 
in every community with a substantial 
white population in Connecticut, and 
ch arged, "The only thing stopping us is 
the Gestapo tactics of the state police. If 
you want to attend a Klan rally in Con-
necticut you'll be stopped better than a 
mile away from the rally site. If the ral-
ly's being held on public property they 
will have blocked all the roads and put 
out a parking ban. They'll search your 
car very thoroughly, under the hood, in 
the air cleaner, under the hubcaps. 
They'll search you very thoroughly, the 
next best thing to a strip search . As a 
matter of fact, the last rally we had they 
had three cops searching an eight-
month-old baby. Right down in the 
diaper. This was done in the interest of 
public safety." 

Chief George Caffery of the Meriden 
police force firmly denied Dillon's 
charges, explaining only certain in-
dividuals were sea.rched at Klan rallies 
after court injunctions were issued. "I 
know of no incident in Meriden where

we have manhandled a Klansman," he 
firmly stated. 

Dillon admitted the IE is not the only 
branch of the Klan in Connecticut, but 
disavowed any connection with the rival 
Northeast United Ku 
Klux 
Klan 
(NUKKK). "They're a splinter group 
that broke off from us last summer," he 
~aid. "They are comprised of some 
former members and some people we 
w0uld 
never accept 
as 
members. 
ney're in my opinion kind of a lunatic 
fringe."

Kar; Peterson, the leader of the North-
east United Ku Klux Klan, drives a 
Mercury Zephyr decorated with five 
Confederate flags and an "I Hate Draft 
Dodgers" bumper sticker. In his glove 
compartment Peterson carries a photo 
of himself and a man he claims is Billy 
Carter, both wearing Klan 
robes. 

Peterson is in his late twenties, a large 
vivacious man with long hair and a 
beard and blue eyes that blink furiously 
when he gets excited. Underneath his 
leather vest he carries a Smith and 
Wesson .44 Magnum strapped to his 
chest. "Don't worry about that," he 
laughed, "it's my Constitutional right. 
I've had enough repercussions from 
joining the Klan- rve had death 
threats, mostly from blacks. They don't 
seem to understand why I joined the 
Klan." Peterson laughed again. "I'd be 
lying if I said it didn't make me ner-
vous. But I'm just a nervous kind of 
person." 

Despite the gun, Peterson's manner 
was disarmingly amiable as he spoke 
about why he joined the KKK. "I've 
never rea.lly thought about the Klan too 
much until they had the rally up in 
Meriden. They had that rally in sup-
