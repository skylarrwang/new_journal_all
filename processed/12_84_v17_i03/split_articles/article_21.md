"America: the land 
where any kid can 
grow up to be Presi-
dent, or, if he's 
luckier, Elvis."

Friday night at the Cafe Grotto isn't 
what you expected. When you heard 
the Grotto was a punk club, visions of 
the Sex-Pistolized kids who hang out on 
Cross Campus probably slam danced in 
your head, but now that you've finally 
sl,lmmon~d the courage to walk all the 
way down to 130 Crown Street, a mere 
six blocks from Phelps Gate, you find 
you don't really need a purple mohawk 
to fit in. Pay your four dollars, walk in, 
grab a beer, pass a group of serious 
punks (clothes torn in all the right 
places) and take a seat with a good view 
of the new-wavers bopping on the dance 
floor. The fashions are courtesy of Lon-
don Touch; neon is in this month. 

Tonight's warm-up band is a local 
punk-funk group, just good enough to 
keep a small crowd dancing. To the 
right, a thirtyish couple who look llke 
they might have been extras for Saturday 
Night Fever drop another quarter in the 
pinball machine. Two girls dressed in 
black gowns with black lace gloves and 
veils walk by, closely followed by two 
guys in flannel shirts, jeans and 
sneakers who look like they just might 
ask the two girls to dance. T he fifty-
year-old man who's been standing at the 
back of the dance floor comes by and 
picks up your empty. The crowd at the 
Grotto is surprisingly cross cultural, 
cross racial, and cross generational. 

The crowd knows the Grotto is the 
only place around New H aven where 
every night of the week someone will be 
playing real live rock and roll, true to 
the spirit of the garage bands of the '60s, 
true to the idea that anyone can play 
rock and roll and everyone should. 

T he bands at the Grotto- local high 
school groups, unknowns from New 
York City and Boston, little-k nown na-
tional acts- prove something night 
after night: the American rock and roll 
dream still lives. If you want to be a 
rock and roll star, just get yourself an 
electric guitar and learn how to play. 

T he headline band tonight is from 
New York City. They're called Singing 
Beach. No one really knows who they 
aoo, and they've performed live twice 
before. When they take the stage, they 
launch into a neo-psychedelic instru-
mental no one can dance to, but then 
start playing some real pop tunes, with 
words, a beat and everything. People 
start getting out of their seats. The 
Grotto is small, and if you walk up to 
the front of the stage you can see the tall 
blonde vocalist, Janet Wygal, has a 
greeting card and a small doll at the top 
of her amp. If you try hard enough you 
can even read the card. It's her birth-
day. 

By the time Singing Beach finishes 
their set the crowd is really into it. Peo-
ple clap and whistle for an encore. 
Someone starts banging on the stage. 
The band comes back and reprises 
"Gathering Roses," the song they want 
to release as a single, if anyone ever 
signs them to a record label. A guy in a 
grey polyester suit and black turtleneck 
who's been pushed up against the stage 
all night starts fanatically snapping 
photo after photo. His camera strap 
adds the perfect new-wave touch to his 
outfit: it's red, white and blue striped 
with little white stars along the edges. 
Someone on the dance floor is really 
getting down and doing the dog. His 
feet slap the floor in a Snoopy shuffie, 
his hands are drawn up against his chest 
like paws. He barks in time to the 
music. W hen the band finishes, Wygal 
steps up to the mike. "We can't play 
anymore," she says. ~That's all the songs ;;; 
we know." 


After the show the band retreats to 
the little white dressing room on the side 
of the stage. T he guy in the grey 
polyester suit follows them. He knows 
all about them. He knows they used to 
be called the Individuals, and that they
