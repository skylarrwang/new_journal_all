Yale's Secret Gardens 
In his recent book Campus, Paul Turner advances the unex-
ceptionable thesis that the campus~ of American colleges 
and universities are "communities in themselves . . . cities 
in microcosm," and that their forms are "different from 
everything else" in American architecture. This is certainly 
true of Yale in New Haven. Yale shapes a closed-off, secret 
world. It is a walled garden, a true Paradise set in an urban 
matrix which is becoming sadder with every passing year . 
But Yale's enclo~ure, its special secretiveness, cannot be 
due exclusively to its urban situation. Harvard, in hostile 
Cambridge, is not nearly so closed. One can filter into the 
Yard from almost anywhere. The Harvard ho~ses on the 
·whole turn much less inward than the Yale colleges do. 
Princeton and Dartmouth, off in Cloud-Cuckoo Land, are 
wide open, but so is Penn, if not Columbia. So it is worth 
thinking about how Yale got to be the way it is. 

At first it was open to the town. Old Brick Row, of which 
Connecticut Hall is the sole survivor, consisted of a splen-
did rank of buildings, alternating some like Connecticut 
HaU with others like churches with frontal towers -like, in 
fact, the churches which came to be built on Temple Street 
during the early nineteenth century. Entrance, as at Con-
necticut Hall, was from either side, so that nothing 
separated Yale from the town but its symbolic Fence along 
College Street. Here Town and Gown met, mingled and 
sometimes fought. Those fights got rougher as the city 
grew bigger and more industrialized. 

At the close of the Civil War there was an exceptionally 
bloody riot (there was a bad one when the troops came 
home after World War I as well), and the University decid-
ed to close itself off from the town. Farnam Hall was 
planned that very year and completed in 1869. It was a 
medieval fortress right on College Street. Entrance was 
possible only on the side away from the Green. All the 
other buildings along the street followed that pattern; Noah 
Porter Gate, with Phelps Hall, flaunting its character as a 
Tudor palace, was set in place in 1895. At the corner of 
Chapel Street a splendid building by Bruce Price, Osborne 
Hall, still opened its grand Romanesque portals to the city, 
but in the 1930s it was replaced by Bingham, a corner 
bastion. Brick Row was torn down, so creating an en-
closed quadrangle, the Old Campus, which is still the only 
satisfactory large communal open space to be found at 
Yale. Cross Campus lacks vc.lumetric shape; Beinecke 
Plaza is unsympathetic, appropriate oply for angry 
demonstrations; and the college courtyards are just that, 
collegial perhaps but surely not universal. 

They are Yale's ultimate gardens and, unlike the Old 
Campus as it can be seen from High Street, they are wholly 
invisible, and thus secret, from the townspeople's point of 
view. Upon them, too, Yale lavished its most elaborate ar-
chitecture. It is interesting to note that James Gamble 
Rogers, (who graduated from Yale in 1889) who has to be 
regarded as their creator, built very little else worth looking 
at (on which short list New Haven's Post Office should rank 
high). The colleges were Rogers' major work, really his 
life's work, and he poured his special devotion to Yale into 
them. Their decoration, soon to be discussed in a study by 
the young historian Stephen Fitch. '81, indeed reveals 
Roger? preoccupation with Yale's more arcane secrets, but 
the major form nf the colleges, the dosed quadrangle, is 
secret enough. Then, too, they are all marvelously escapist; 
Gothic first, Colonial later, and they were attacked as such 
during the early days of their construction by a lively 
undergraduate publication called The Harkness Hoot. 

Still, modernist contempt for their eclecticism, in which 
my generation was brought up, can now be disregarded. 
They are marvelous architecture, shaping as they do splen-
didly realized courtyard spaces with highly convincing, 
beautifully built and detailed building forms. Indeed, Stiles 
and Morse, the latest to be built-and designed not by 
Rogers but by Eero Saarinen- are much the least convin-
cing, 
precisely bec;ause modernist reductionism has 
seriously impoverished their architectural vocabulary. It is 
a touching sidelight on their planning, nevertheless, that 
Saarinen designed them on the diagonal in order to en-
courage townspeople to walk through the block, rather than 
to be forced always to the periphery as they are by Yale's 
quadran~les. Saarinen did not even want his colleges to 
have gates. Now, alas, those gates seem to have to be closed 
ti~ht a good deal of the time. 

The very first of the colleges, Branford and Saybrook, 
are the most elaborate and probably the best. They were 
not originally intended for colleges but were begun in the 
191 Os 
as one great residential complex, 
Harkness 
Memorial Quadrangle, and were subdivided in the early 
1930s when the college system was brou~ht into being. 
H ere the courtyard spaces, overlooked by the great tower, 
are among the strongest in any of the colleges and at the 
same time the most labyrinthine, in that sense the most 
secret, with many tiny courts tucked away, so making 
much play with the age-old idea of the secret garden. The 
decoration too is the richest and at least one of the most 
elaborately iconographic, full of more or less veiled 
references to Yale's peculiar ways. 

It is interesting that the first contemporary study of the 
Yale r.olleges to take them seriously as architecture was 
made by Paul Goldberger, '72, then one qfthe early editors 
of The New journal and now architectural critic for the New 
York Times, as his senior thesis at Yale. Goldberger, who 
won the Pulitzer Prize last year, concentrated on the forms 
of the buildings, which, if I remember correctly, he called 
something like "Banker's Gothic" and "Banker's Georgian." 
So while he was among the fU"St to look at them sym-
pathetically he still seemed to feel the need to strike a 
somewhat pejorative note in their stylistic naming. The 
present study by Fitch, however, is involved much less with 
style than with meaning, and it will surely teach us a good 
deal about Yale and so, one supposes, about ourselves. 

One thing is clear right now: Yale is an unusually secret 
place. It closes in upon itself in an attempt at isolation 
which cannot be ascribed only to its urban situation, but 
has to be regarded as deeply systemic, elaborately tribal 
and surely rather proud.
