Yale's Decaying Colleges 
Rich Blow 
"In many places the colleges look like 
high class slums," said Berkeley Master 
Robin Winks. 

Yale President A. 
Bartlett Giamatti felt differently, say-
ing that the colleges are "splendid 
residences" which "provide an oppor-
tunity for combining living and learn-
ing unparalleled in this country." The 
disparity between Winks' and Giamat-
ti's views shows that, after 51 years of 
residential colleges, Yale students and 
faculty still have trouble assessing the 
status of the Yale colleges. 

Today the gulf between the college 
system in theory and the realities of 
college life is increasingly apparent to 
students and faculty alike. After half a 
century the colleges are crowded far 
beyond their original capacity, des-
perate for new space and facilities, and 
weakened by the onslaught of old age. 
The consequence is a noticeable drop 
in both the quality of on-campus living 
and the educational potential of the 
college system.

"When I lived on campus it seemed 
to me that everything was just falling 
apart," explained Sarah Lyall, DC '85, 
who moved to a house on Dwight 
Street after her sophomore year. "The 
bathrooms were always d isgusting and 
there was never any quiet because 
there were so many people around. In 
my room you could hear everything 
that went on in the suite through the 
fire door- so we all knew about it 
when one of the guys there had a new 
girlfriend." 

Lyall is one of about 500 students 
annually who opt to leave the colleges 
and live elsewhere. When the first 
seven residential colleges were com-
pleted in 1933, each housed 150-200 
students; now, even with the addition 
of Berkeley, Timothy Dwight, and 
Silliman later in the 30's, and Morse 
and Stiles in 1962, each college holds 
about 100 more students than original-
ly planned. The first seven colleges 
held about 1240 students; by 1983 that 
number had risen to 1780. Rooms 
meant to be singles are now doubles, 
doubles are now triples, and so on. For 
many students, off-campus or annex 
housing is the best way to escape such 
crowded conditions. 

From her apartment on Edgewood 
Avenue, Marie Wilkinson, PC '86, 
spoke about why she left campus. 
"Studying in college rooms is next to 
impossible because you can never shut 
out the noise of the people around 
you," Wilkinson said. "You can always 
hear their stereos, their telephones, 
even their bathrooms." 

Junior Brad Berenson lives in Mc-
Clellan Hall on the Old Campus with 
students from Jonathan Edwards, 
Branford and Calhoun. Berenson has 
no regrets about leaving J E: "If I were 
still living in the college I would be 
squeezed into a run-down three room 
triple. Now I live in a renovated four-
person suite with three bedrooms, a 
large living room and a private

bathroom. Why should I miss living in 
J E?" 

But Berenson's 
roommate Matt 
Holmes said he regretted having to 
choose between the advantages of liv-
ing in a college and those of living in 
McClellan. "I do miss the college," 
Holmes said. "There's no atmosphere 
here, no sense of community. We don't 
really feel like we're part of the college 
system." 

College masters find the problem of 
overcrowding equally frustrating. As 
Calhoun Master Ramsay MacMullen 
"What the colleges 
need is a lot more 
money and a lot 
fewer bodies." 
commented , "If I had some god-like 
power, the first thing I would do is cut 
enrollment by a lot. I've often said that 
what the colleges need is a lot more 
money and a lot fewer bodies." 

President Giamatti has 
slightly 
trimmed Yale's enrollment, limiting 
the size of the freshman class to 1250 
students when in past years it ap-
proached 1400. But cutting enrollment 
is an expensive proposition, both 
financially and otherwise. As jonathan 
Edwards Master Frederic Holmes 
pointed out, "If you cut enrollment, 
then fewer people are going to get a 
Yale education, and is that worth it?" 

Donald Kagan, former T imothy 
Dwight master and chairman of the 
Committee on the Future of the 
Residential Colleges, argued that the 
only feasible way to reduce crowding 
was to build a 13th college. "Right now 
there are definitely more students who 
want to live in the colleges than they 
can hold- but there are also too many 
students who ought to be at Yale to 
reduce enrollment. That's why the 
Committee saw the addition of a new
