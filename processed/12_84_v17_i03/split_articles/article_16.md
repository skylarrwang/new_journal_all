Uniting Two New Havens 
The New Haven in which Yale students live, the gothic and granite 
enclave surrounded by bright street lights, is a centrally located suburb 
of the other New Haven, the nation's seventh poorest city. Twenty-three 
r~.rcent of the residents 9fthe latter live below the poverty level, while a 
much larger percentage of the former will join the nation's economic 
elite within a few years. 

Historically. the University's tax status and co~mitment to the 
economic development of New Haven have repeatedly been called into 
question. Now, dueÂ·to the city's economic renais.sance, Yale's relation-
ship to New Haven has once again become a topic for debate. Alison 
Gardy outlines the two sides . of the controversy about Yale's civic 
responsibilities and its recent investments in the city's reqevelopment . 
. Tina Kelley describes a major cooperative effort, Science Park, one of 
the city's and University's more adventurous and innovative attempts to 
unite the two New Havens.
