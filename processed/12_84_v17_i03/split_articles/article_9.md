An Artist's Legacy 
Photos of bodies, faces and landscapes 
hang on both sides of the unused fire-
place. Light filters through open win-
dows into the va:cant room. R oom 1787 
Silliman College, Maya's Room, is the 
only undergraduate-run, 
permanent 
gallery space at Yale. Although hidden 
far above the well-traveled paths of the 
University, the gallery and its many of-
ferings 
are gradually attracting 
students. 

Maya's Room opened in spring 1982 
with a retrospective of multi-media 
work by the late Maya Tanaka Han-
way, SM '82. "Originally Maya talked 
with (Silliman Master William Bennett, 
J r.) about establishing a student-run art 
gallery," 
Fran 
Bennett, 
Master 
Bennett's wife, explained. "After her 
death in J anuary 1981, as a memorial 
to Maya, her parents donated the bal-
ance of her tuition to this cause." In fall 
1981, Master Bennett, together with 
Resident Fellows David and Meryl 
Blinder and a group of students, began 
converting Room I 787 into an art 
gallery. 

"'We've had an eclectic kind of ex-
posure up until this point," Mrs. Ben-
nett said. "It's been very exciting." Ex-
hibits have included a landmark show 
commemorating the Solidarity move-
ment, incorporating posters and but-
tons designed by political prisoners. 
Maya's Room also d isplayed children's 
drawings and paintings done by Polish 
surrealists in response to the implemen-
tation of martial law. In spring 1983, 
freelance illustrator David Suter, whose 
work appears in The New York Times, 
displayed his political drawings at the 

Despite the ambition and dedication 
invested in the undertaking, the gallery 
has been virtually unrecognized by 
most Yale students. "Part of what we 
wanted was to create a gallery that 
would not only be a link between 
students and the Yale community, but 
also one for New Haven and New York 
artists," commented Sarah Whiting, 
SM '86, originally one of the guiding 
forces of the gallery. "But there's really 
been no following outside Silliman. 
There's just so much happening on 
campus that if you didn't have big 
names, people wouldn't come. It was 
demoralizing." Furthermore, Whiting 
found artists, architects and sculptors 
outside of New Haven were frequently 
so occupied with their work they didn't 
have time to exhibit. 

This year, however, under the d irec-
tion of T im Peterson , SM '86, and 
Katie Winter, SM '87, Maya's Room 
h;,s changed its focus: they plan to con-
ceutrate solely on undergraduate art. 
"It\ the only chance for undergrads to 
get response from their peers," Winter 
1787 Silliman College. 
said. "In class you just don't get a feeling 
of what it's going to be like as an artist 
in the real world." Mervl Blinder add-
ed, "There's lots of tale~t hidden away 
at Yale. I think this year we may have 
found something." 

Following an extensive and extreme-
ly effective publicity campaign, the first 
undergraduate 
phowgraphy exhibit 
opened on November 9, entitled "The 
Undergraduate Lens." "I was unsure of 
what to expect after last year's lack of in-
terest," Winter explained. "But people 
seemed really excited by the work at the 
opening." 

Most of the seven photographers in 
the show had never before exhibited 
their work. Hanna \IVeg, MC '87, one 
exhibitor, commented, "Katie was will-
ing to choose a number of different 
kinds of photography and a number of 
different styles. Students appreciated 
the fact it was purely an undergraduate 
show, and it was the best turnout 
Maya's Room has had . ., 

Future plans include exhibits of ar-
chitectural models and drawings and a 
graphic design show. "It's incredible," 
W hiting said. "Artists may bring all the 
work they have to the gallery, and each 
show somehow seems to come togNher 
in a new and different way. There's 
something magical about that."
