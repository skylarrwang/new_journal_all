meetings with local residents, often 
working to find reasonable mortgages 
and other financial 
assistance. 
Chauncey recalled: "They said to me, 
'Do anything you can to create jobs. 
We'll decide how 
to spend 
the 
money.' " 
"I don't think Science Park's in a 
position to help us," said Willie Green, 
executive director of the NewhallVITle 
Neighborhood Corporation. "Science 
Park is in a Catch-22 situtation. It's 
caught between the city and the com-
munity. The Neighborhood Corpora-
tion lost $56,000 through the Com-
munity Development Act. The city 
says the funds went towards the 
$200,000 they gave to Science Park, 
but this has no impact on the com-
munity on the whole. 
"The city says Science Park's our 
savior, and we see it can't get us jobs. 
There are very decent individuals [in 
the SPDC] who've tried to be a re-
source for us, and they've called us in 
when they had no job openings, but 
the Park offers hi-tech jobs, and the 
community's not qualified for them." 
To help remedy this situation, the 
Corporation has instituted training 
programs specifically for the benefit of 
New Haven youth. Downstairs from 
Science Park headquarters, 
Regional Council 'On Education for 
Employment (RCEE) cond!-lcts the 
first training program jointly spon-
sored by the federal government and a 
private corporation. IBM has donated 
$250,000, business equipment and in-
structors who teach disadvantaged 
high school graduates word processing 
and office skills. Of the 25 participants 
in the second 15-week cycle of the pro-
gram, all but one have found full-time 
jobs. Half of them are from Dixwell-
Newhallville. "Science Park has af-
fected Dixwell-N ewhallville in a very 
positive way," said Willie Bradley, a 
RCEE career counsellor and Newhall-
ville resident. 

Along with tax abatements and new-
job grants Science Park companies will 
receive under state enterprise zone 
legislation for employing area resi-
dents, the RCEE program is a first 
step in the Park's efforts to spur the 
economic recovery of the surrounding 
area. Eventually, the SPDC hopes to 
attract $1 million in new tax revenues 
for the city and 2,000 jobs, half of them 
for Dixweli-Newhallville residents. 
Since June 1, 1983 the Corporation 
has created 413 new jobs, 104 for 
neighborhood residents, for a total of 
489 Dixweli-Newhallville employees. 
As more companies move into the 
complex, job openings in food 
preparation, security and maintenance 
can be earmarked for the predomi-
nantly 
unskilled 
neighborhood 
residents. 

Still, Chauncey balks at the slow 
T ace of development. "How has 
Science Park helped the neighbor-
hood? To give a vivid answer, it 
hasn't," he said. "I think it has, but it's 
important to realize that it's not going 
to happen overnight. 
It's terribly 
frustrating for me and the people who 
live around here. If you come in and 
say that improvements will take place 
20 years from now, it's frustrating for 
everyone." 
The three-year grants Science Park 
received from Olin and New Haven 
expire this month, and Chauncey will 
be asking his sponsors for further fund-
ing. "We'll have to show them what 
we've done already with practically no 
money," he said. "Economic develop-
ment is by nature a very slow process. 
We'll soon see psychological advan-
tages because of the building of the 
first new building, and the place will 
begin to look a little better with its new 
parking lot and plantings, but it will be 
15 to 20 years before we can really tell 
how successful we'll be." 
Though slow, the process is crucial 
for everyone involved. "If New Haven 
fails," Chauncey said, "Yale fails, and 
vice versa."
