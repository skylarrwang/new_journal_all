A Summer at War 
"I learned that you had to be tough, and 
not particularly nice, to survive the 
H olocaust," said Reuel Schiller, SM 
'88. "I dealt with many people, in-
cluding the producer, who had survived 
it, and I found myself saying, 'There is 
no way I would have survived if I had 
been in the Warsaw ghetto, because I'm 
just not that kind of person.'" A year 
ago, however, Schiller did enter the 
Nazi-occupied Warsaw of World War 
II. In his first film role Schiller por-
trayed aJewish partisan in The Children's 
War, 
which 
will 
be released 
this 
January. 

Reuel Schiller

Schiller learned of the film 
in 
February 1983 when casting agent Deb-
bie Brown canvassed New York high 
schools seeking young actors. "The 
director wanted to work with actors who 
weren't really experienced because he 
wanted to be able to mold them," 
Schiller said. Schiller, then a junior at 
St. Ann's School in Brooklyn H eights, 
met with Brown on a whim, but soon 
forgot about the movie and got a sum-
mer job working in a law firm. In late 
April, however, he received a call from 
B'rciwn, met with the director and then 
made a screen test. A week later he 
received a major role in the new film. 

The Children's War details the 1943 
Jewish uprising in the Warsaw ghetto. 
The film's main character is Jasek 
Eisner, a young Jew who smuggles food 
and weapons into the ghetto until he is 
caught by the Nazis. Schiller plays 
Lutek, Jasek's quiet but cynical smug-
gler friend. "Lutek was the son of a 
wealthy Jewish merchant. Without the 
war, he would have grown up to be a 
good-for-nothing, a playboy," Schiller 
said. "He was the wrong kind of person 
to be fighting in the ghetto uprising. 
Thd 'only r~ason he survived so long 
was because he was so bitter." 

The crew filmed for two months in 
Budapest, Hungary, and then at the 
Birkenau concentration 
camp 
Poland, where Jews were sent as 
laborers if they were not sent to 
neighboring Auschwitz. The Children's 
War was the first American production 
o; 
to be filmed at Birkenau. 

As a Jew, Schiller found fUming at 
~ 
!t Birkenau disturbing. "When I was in 
~ Budapest, being Jewish had less of an 
~ effect, but at Auschwitz and at Birken-
~ au - it was a nightmare there. I could 
Â· ! not believe that anything had actually 
6 happened there. It was inconceivable," 
he said. 

The Children's War was directed by 
Moshe 
Mizrahi, 
the 
well-known 
French-Israeli director who won the 
1977 Best Foreign Language Film 
Oscar for Madame Rosa. Jack Eisner, the 
Jasek Eisener of the film, produced The 
Children's War, which is based on his 
book 
The 
Survivor. 
Although 20th 
Century Fox will probably distribute 
the film, Schiller doubts that such a 
serious production will be commercially 
successful. 

In addition to The Children's War and 
high school productions, Schiller has 
recently 
appeared in 
the Timothy 
Dwight Dramat production of Woody 
Allen's God and Death. Despite his in-
terest in drama, Schiller does not plan 
to make it a profession. "I met so many 
people who had just wasted their lives 
being actors while ftlming," he said. 
"The movie, when I did it, was for fun, 
and I want to keep my acting that way."
