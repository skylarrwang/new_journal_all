EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Liberal Confusion 
To the Editor: 
In your article on rape, "Among 
Friends" (TNJ, Oct. 19, 1984), I was 
sorry to make the acquaintance of yet 
another new abuse our masochistic so-
ciety seems to be heaping upon itself 
(from acid rain neurosis to nuclear 
neurosis) -your so-called "acquain-
tance rape." 

The very notion of "acquaintance 
rape~ as you describe it in particular in-
stances in 
that article effectively 
eradicates the achievements of the last 
ten years of Women's Liberation by 
portraying woman as a frail, mute, in-
decisive, helpless blob of protoplasm 
who, when mounted by a drunken 
preppy, doesn't know how to deal with 
the situation. 

Has she no mouth to scream, no 
teeth to bite, no fingers to scratch, no 
hands to pull hair, no knees to kick? 
Come now, let's get sensible about 
this new abuse which is plaguing up to 
"twenty percent" of campus under-Â· 
graduates, so-called "acquaintance 
.rape." The same rapport which causes 
the victim's confusion about whether or 
not she is being violated may also be 
causing the 
perpetrator's confusion 
about whether or not he is violating her, 
especially when you cite the violator as 
an inebriant. 

Do you actually expect drunks to be 
courtly? Katherine Hepburn has taught 
many leading men that that is precisely 
what a well-placed slap across the face is 
for: to put a man back in his place. 

Do you mean to tell me that a 
modern undergraduate woman at Yale 
is so desperate for peer approval-or 
preppy approval- that she wouldn't 
slap a fresh fellow in the face? 

I'm sick of this Liberal confusion 
about boundaries. When acid rain falls 
on my garden or nuclear waste is 
dumped ofT my shoreline, I scream! 
When a man ~ets fresh, girls, I suggest 
you do the same, and more: scream, 
slap him in the face, pull his hair, bite 
him, scratch him or kick him in the 
groin. After all, he is your "acquain-
tance," he knows he can't just run away 
and disappear without being identified. 
Establish your boundaries! Don't just 
ponder whether or not you are being 
violated and then surface a year later 
with an allegation attached to the latest 
label in our society's self-abuse parade. 

The real problem- which our diseased 
consumer society refuses to face- is 
that we have turned even sex into a 
commodity to be consumed, and for-
gotten that it is a favor and privilege to 
be granted. 

Sincerely,

Sexual carelessness 
When I read Joyce Banerjee's article 
I find myself wanting to respond in 
slogans: "Sexuality- not just genitalia!" 
"Protect the 
whole 
person!" "Stop 
'casual' 
sex!" "This is 
a 
sick 
society- caveat emptor!" as though 
words would 
stem 
the tide of 
carelessness in our treatment of others 
and ourselves. 

The difficulty of acquaintance rape: 
who is to blame? He is, of course- but 
he was confused, sick, demoralized. He 
isn't female; how could he know how 
she would feel? (She is female; why 
doesn't she look after herself?) 

It must be very hard to help one 
another with moral behavior. Perhaps 
most of us find it too difficult; we may 
have enough to do to become ethical 
ourselves. 

Still 
there 
should be, 
minimally, correctives to offer when 
something is badly wrong. In cases of 
injury or theft or of the simpler 
varieties of violence, 
surely ad-
ministrators would help. 

Sexual violence may be the prover-
bial painful matter, where everyone 
wants to look away. It is precisely in 
such instances that each of us must 
learn to see. There is no arena where 
the confusion of passions can be more 
destructive than in the sexual en-
counter. Not only rape but even death 
can ensue out of a collision of wills-as 
this community m ay remember. 

Committees and streamlined pro-
cedures perhaps may help. Some prac-
tice of confrontation m ay also have to 
be instituted. The man who hurt 'Sarah' 
and would have hurt 'Joan' needs to 
know that he has to stop. The aggrieved 
may be unable to get the point across; 
perhaps there is someone who can . 

Granted the.structural difficulty, sex-
ual carelessness is a problem much too 
pervasive and too intimate to be ade-
quately addressed by bureaucratic 
means. At most the System can ratify 
work that has already been done- work 
that comes closer to home. 

My thanks to J oyce, to 'Sarah' and to 
:Joan'. 

In peace,
