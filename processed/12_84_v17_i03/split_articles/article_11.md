college as the only option." 
But Yale will probably not soon, if 
ever build a 13th college; the estimated 
cost of such a project is between 
S40-S50 million, and the administra-
tion has no plans to raise so much 
money for an unsettled issue. 

In the meantime overcrowding also 
curtails the productive potential of 
Yale's student organizations, most of 
which look to the colleges for badly-
nef"ded office and meeting space. 
Publications, college dramats, even 
college councils are aU forced to com -
pete for the limited public space within 
the colleges. 

Leo Charney, '86, president of the 
Branford Dramat, explained how his 
group views the problem: "We have no 
space for auditions or rehearsals, so we 
have to make do with unused space in 
the Branford basement. That's hardly 
ideal, but it could still be worse- a lot 
of shows have to rehearse in places like 
Linsly-Chittenden 
Hall 
because 
there's no room for them elsewhere." 

Most dramats turn to the college 
dining haJls to put on their plays, 
although the dining haJls are already 
more than comfortably full. Theoretically places for intellectuaJ thought 
and conversation outside the class-
room, at peak hours the dining halls 
are transformed into mob scenes, 
noisy, cramped and uncomfortable. 

Robin 
Winks commented, "The 
Berkeley dining haJl was built for 280 
orderly people, sitting down in coats 
and ties and waiting to be served. 
Now, with freshmen. fellows, Â·.-ansfers 
and off-campus students comin~ in, we 
can expect 550-600 people crammed in 
there on any given night." 

Likewise, coiJege facilities for in-
dividuaJ academic work cannot meet 
the demands of YaJe undergraduates. 
Students who need the colleges for 
music rooms, language labs, athletic 
facilities and th~ like often find these 
facilities broken, run-down or entirely 
absent. The situation can impede a 
student's work and make a master's life 
miserable 

Pierson Master H arold Morowitz 
has tried to solve the problem by 
spending hours 
of 
physicaJ 
labor 
rebuilding Pierson facilities. With stu-
dent help he has carried boxes, cleared 
rooms and painted waJls whenever it 
seemed the only way things would be 
improved. As a result Pierson has 
some of the nicest facilities at YaJe, in-
cluding an exercise room, an espresso 
lounge and an extensively equipped 
computer room. Still, M orowitz con-
ceded every hour he spent on such 
endeavors was an hour he could have 
devoted to overseein g the inteiJectual 
life of the college. "You don't want a 
master who's consigned to plumbing," 
Morowitz said. "That's not supposed to 
be part of the job, but it often turns out 
to be the biggest part." 

Some students take it upon them-
selves to redress college shortcomings. 
When Adam Stock, SY '85, andjulien 
Mininberg, SY '86, decided that their 
college needed a printing press, they 
turned to Saybrook alumni for help. 
"We were one of the only colleges at 
YaJe not to have a press and we figured 
we'd have better luck asking the aJums 
for money than asking the adrninstra-
tion," Mininberg said. "In the end it 
worked out great, but I'm not sure that 
it's the students who should have to 
tackle this kind of problem." 

Not only overcrowding and short-
ages of facilities limit the productivity 
of the college system; after five decades 
of Connecticut winters, the buildings 
themselves are deteriorating, plagued 
by leaky roofs, broken plumbing and 
inadequate heat. In 1984 Yale will 
spend some S7 million on routine 
maintenance aJone, yet even this huge 
sum will not arrest the threatening ef-
fects of age. 

"YaJe can never rebuild these col-
leges," said Davenport Master Henry 
Turner. "To have let them faJI into 
such a state of disrepair is tragic." Like 
most masters Turner deaJs extensively 
with maintenance problems, and he 
feels this lessens his contributions to the 
educational experience of students in 
his c~!l<!~e. "Wht>n I came here in 1981 
I assumed I was here to enrich the in-
tellectuaJ life of D avenport students. 
But to my great aJarm I discovered that 
no one was taking care of the college." 

The first challenge Turner faced as a 
new master was a longtime problem 
with leaking gutters built into one wing 
of the college. Every rainfall saturated 
the walls of student rooms, causing 
them to smell and grow mold. It took 
T urner three-and-a-half years to cut 
through red tape and get the gutters 
fixed. The frustrated master said, "I've 
been fighting these problems since I 
became master and now J!m getting 
tired of it. I teach, I write books, I try 
to make the life of the college more in-
teresting, but this is just a drag." 

Physical plant problems hit students 
hardest in winter when low Connec-
ticut temperatures force students in-
doors. As almost any student will 
attest, most dorm rooms are either 
boiling hot or cold. One Branford 
junior stills remembers his struggles 
for warmth in his room last winter. "In 
the mornings from about five to six the 
heat would just come pouring on; in-
evitably I'd wake up in a sweat. But 
there was so little insulation in my 
room that by the time I had to get up I 
could see my breath in the air. I don't 
know how many classes I skipped 
because 50 minutes of education 
weren't worth the misery of getting out 
of bed."
