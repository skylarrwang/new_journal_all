â€¢ recorded an album under that name at 
~ Mitch Easter's Drive-In Studio in 
~ North Carolina. Easter is a music pro-
! ducer whose chirpy, energetic, neo-
:; garage production techniques have 
J been dubbed the "new American sound" 
e by Rolling Stone. In a quirky literaliza-
=; tion of the ideal of garage band rock, 
Easter converted his parents' garage in 
Winston-Salem, North Carolina into a 
rc;yording studio. Bands like R.E.M., 
the Bongos and Easter's own Let's Ac-
tive hole up in the Easter house, eat 
Mrs. Easter's cooking and make the 
sort of music which just might get every 
American kid thinking he could be a 
rock and roll star. 

The hand-lettered sign of the dress-
ing room door isn't exactly tough or 
authoritative: 
BAND MEMBERS ONLY 
PLEASE 
It doesn't stop too many people from in-
viting themselves backstage, and it sure 
doesn't stop the guy in the grey poly-
ester suit from living out his rock and 
roll dream: backstage with the band 
after the gig. But then that's just the 
point. The Grotto's a place where rock 
and roll dreams can still come true, a 
place where anybody with an electric 
guitar can be a star, a place where peo-
ple can dance to living music instead of 
records, a place where anyone, even a 
guy in grey polyester, can end up 
backstage with the band after the gig. 

Backstage tonight things are a bit 
confused. The dressing room is a jungle 
of black cables leading to black boxes. 
Someone in the band tries to figure out 
just how many free beers they're en-
titled to. Lead guitarist David Hoaston, 
whose accent is a sure tip-off he's from 
somewhere in England, explains to a 
friend that the band almost didn't make 
tonight's show. Someone changed the 
lock on their practice space in New 
York and locked up all their equipment, 
and to top it ofT they lost their bass 
player. Wygal tries to convince the bass 
player they found for tonight, Ilene 
Markell, CC '85, to join the band. 
Markell's no stranger to the dilemma of 
balancing rock and roll and academics 
-she's back at Yale after a two-year

"The almost gone days 
of rock and roll as a 
radically democratic 
art form live again." 
leave to play with her last band, 
Skunkadelic- nor is she a stranger to 
the Grotto- Skunkadelic was the first 
band to play the Grotto when it opened 
November 25, 1983. 
"It's a great place," she. says of the 
Grotto. "It's cheap as hell and you can 
just walk down here. I don't know why 
more Yale people don't come. I still 
think they're afraid to leave a ten-foot 
radius." 

Wygal agrees with Markell about the 
G rotto. "It feels great to play here. It's a 
little tomb-like, no, make that womb-
like; it's got a real comforting feeling. 
But then I like a dark cavernous place." 

The Grotto's basement location does 
make it a little dark and tomb-like; at 
least that's the feeling you get from the 
plaster stalactites on the ceiling and tiny 
monks' heads sculpted into the capitals 
of the columns in the barroom. "All 
those 
stalagmites or stalactites or 
whatever are leftover from when the 
place was some bizarre bondage club," 
booking director Mark Mullcahy ex-
plained. 

The decor is late art-drecko. In the 
stage/dance floor area there are at least 
three kinds of mismatched wallpaper, a 
non-functional fireplace (probably from 
the G rotto's days as a German Beer 
Palace) and Day-Glo squiggles painted 
on the walls to pick up the black lights 
over the dance floor. Those black lights 
are the only lighti!lg on the dance floor 
-none of the flashing strobes and puls-
ing colored lights usually found in a 
dance club, but then, the Grotto's no 
disco.
