similar experience in Branford. Stre-
beigh, who teaches a class in a cold, 
wet seminar room in the college, ad-
mitted how difficult teaching can be 
under such conditions. "There've been 
times I've been trying to teach and I 
see students bundled up in hats and 
gloves, so cold they can't even concen-
trate. It makes me feel like I might as 
well just end the class early," Strebeigh 
said. 

The. cause of the heat problem is the 
inadequacy of Yale's antiquated 
heating systems. Except for Morse and 
Stiles all the colleges are warmed by 
steam pumped into 50-year-old 
radiators. "It is a noisy, erratic and 
wasteful system," explained Ken Borst, 
Director of Construction Manage-
ment. "Back when heat was cheap they 
pumped so much steam into the rooms 
that people would control the temper-
ature just by opening their windows. 
We can't afford to do that anymore, 
but there's no way to fix these systems 
short of replacif!g them." That job, 
Borst estimated, 
would cost over 
$500,000 per college, and Yale has no 
plans to allocate funds for something 
considered a low priority project. In 
the meantime students will keep com-
plaining to Physical Plant, which 
receives up to 250 complaints about 
heating problems a week. 

Clearly what the colleges need to 
restore their full residential attrac-
tiveness and educational capabilities is 
money, a lot of money. Whether they 
will get those funds depends in large 
part upon Terry Holcombe, Vice-
President for Development and Alum-
ni Affairs. Holcombe is working to 
raise some S80 million for Yale this 
year. Only about six percent of that 
money will go to the colleges, however, 
and only about half of that sum will be 
spent on maintenance. Restoration, 
Holcombe admitted, is a difficult pro-
ject. "After fifty years there's a lot that's 
beyond repair, and after decades of 
deferred maintenance, boom! The bill 
comes due. But we're just shooting for 
preservation 
now. 
Restoration-
"Yale can never 
rebuild these 
colleges." 
bringing the colleges back to what they 
used to be- is something that we could 
never afford." 

Holcombe added most alumni 
would rather contribute to a new gym 
than to new heat or plumbing systems. 
"Just try raising money to put a new 
roof on the Pierson dining hall. What 
are we going to tell them, that we'll put 
their name on the roof of Pierson Col-
lege?" 

Many masters try to pick up where 
Yale fund raising leaves off, starting 
small financial campaigns of their own. 
But as with maintenance issues, most 
masters don't think fund raising is 
something they should be forced to do. 
"I'm uncomfortable with that role," 
said Frederic Holmes, "but a lot of 
times there just is no other option. Get-
ting money from Yale is like getting 
blood out of a turnip." 

Yet money alone will not cure the ills 
plaguing the colleges. First Yale must 
recognize that the physical well-being 
of the colleges is a prerequisite for Yale 
students' optimum education. The 
problems of age and overcrowding 
have diminished 
the 
educational 
opportunities the colleges were de-
signed to foster,and until those prob-
lems are solved the college system will 
never be able to reach its full educa-
tional potential.
