Yale: A Good Neighbor? 
"Go to P ayne-Whitney Gym, look out 
the back window from the running 
track, and see 'Yale's backyard,' the 
Dixwell neighborhood ," said Frank 
Logue, former mayor of New H aven 
and a Yale Law School graduate. "I 
think it's in Yale's interest to do 
something about that backyard." 

"Yale as an institution shouldn't get 
involved in things it doesn't know 
anything about," said Ralph Halsey, 
'71, former director of Community 
and State Relations at Yale and now 
with the Science Park project. "Social 
services is at the top of th e list. We 
don't have any professional schools in 
that area. To believe Yale knows more 
about social services than the man in 
the moon is incorrect." 

The debate is almost as old as Yale 
itself. T he unresolved question of how 
Yale can balance. its obligation s to itself 
and to New Haven has surfaced once 
again- but this time with a new twist. 
Over the past five years Yale has 
become an increasingly active capital 
investor in the city, where approx-
imately 30,000 residents, over 23 per-
cent of the population, live below the 
poverty level. 

For those who see Yale as primarily 
an academic institution which happens 
to exist in New Haven, Yale's con-
tributions seem impressive. For those 
who stress Yale's role as the leading in-
stitutional citizen in New Haven, 
Yale's contributions are not enough. 

Some feel the University, as the 
number one employer, third largest 
taxpayer and owner of seven percent of 
the property in New Haven, is the 
city's leading institutional citizen. Yale 
has a responsibility to be a model con-
tributor, to use its vision and expertise 
to rebuild the city and to lead other in-
stitutions and businesses to 
make 
larger commitments to New H aven's 
renewal. 

The Yale administration disagrees; 
it feels the University helps New 
Haven by its very presence. It attracts 
culture and visitors, and through U.S. 
Grant, the New Haven Teachers' In-
stitute and Dwight Hall volunteer pro-
grams, performs social services for 
New Haven. 

But Yale first and 
Alison Gardy 
foremost is concerned with the educa-
tion and well-being of its own com-
munity. Its primary consideration in 
any investment must be its endow-
ment, the measure of Yale's security. 
The University's investment policy 
must be cautious and self-interested. 

"Yale has always had a very tentative 
approach to the community-one foot 
on the brake," Logue said. "I'm very 
aware of Yale's contribution to the city, 
but I don't see any sign that it thinks of 
itself in citizen terms and I think it 
should." Logue suggested Yale set 
aside 
more money

social purpose and are not expected to

something to do it and not to do it," he 
said. H e encouraged investments in

system, which only five years ago had a 
30 percent dropout rate among 16- to 
19-year olds. Compared to suburban

dropouts,

graduates have a 20 percent lower 
chance of finding jobs. "The New

sion. 

. John Buckman, vice president for 
finance at Yale, defends Yale's caution 
in investing. "I think some members of 
the community expect Yale to do an in-
ordinate amount. Yale can not single-
handedly bring economic well-being 
back to New Haven. That requires a 
community effort." 

Reverend John Hay of the United 
C hurch in New Haven and a graduate 
of the Yale Divinity and Drama 
Schools sees the issue as part of a larger 
problem. "The trend of the country is 
individualistic," he said. "Opportunity 
is a self-centered word. I would hope 
Yale would tune into the older vision of 
. community, but I think it's drifting 
with the rest of the country toward a 
more individualistic philosophy. The 
history of Yale could be written as a 
history of withdrawal. Yale is denying 
its roots." 

On the other hand, John Wilkinson, 
secretary of the University and chair-
man of the Economic Development 
Commission of New Haven, said 
Yale's involvement in New Haven has 
grown increasingly active. "Starting 
with World War I, Yale closed the city 
out. The doors on Old Campus going 
out into the city were closed. We 
turned our backs on the city. As Bart 
Giamatti says, 'Yale didn't discover it 
was an urban university until 1970.' 
We've been trying in the last 15 years 
to be more involved." 

A major sign of Yale's recent in-
volvement in New Haven is its increas-
ing number of capital investments. In 
1961 Yale contributed $4.5 million to 
the construction of the Chapel Square 
Mall, then for two decades made vir-
tually no further investments in rhe 
city. 

"It's only in the last five years that 
Yale has done much of this kind of in-
vestment," said Buckman. "Prior to 
that, New H aven was in a difficult 
period- the early '70s- as it went 
through the urban crises that many 
cities went through, symbolized by the 
Black Panther trial and all of the urban

violence and rioting that occurred 
here. And I don't think anyone was . 
very excited, including the Yale invest-
ment committee, about 
investing 
money in downtown New Haven. It 
just looked awfully risky. So it's a com-
bination of change in attitude and of 
New Haven becoming a safer, more 
interesting place to inve.st money. It's 
sort of a fortuitous coincidence." 

In 1979 Yale began a five-year spree 
in New Haven downtown develop-
ment by lending $350,000 to help 
finance conversion of the Taft Hotel. 
Two years later, the University com-
mitted property, funds and office space 
to Science Park, and extended a 
ground lease for converting the Ster-
ling Nursing Dormitory to apart-
ments. In 1982 Yale loaned $500,000 
for the purchase and renovation of 
One Broadway and anqther $1.45 
million to Schiavone Realty for the 
Shubert Square project. A year later 
Yale loaned $1.5 million toward the 
renovation of the Chapel Square Mall, 
and this year the University is selling 
its property at Whitney and Grove 
Streets for a mixed-use project. 

"As the city improves, more people 
become interested in investing," Buck-
man said. "I could easily conceive of 
investments being proposed as if they 
were the same quality as the endow-
ment investments that we make." 

But Logue criticized Yale's in-
vestments as meek. "Yale made a small 
loan guarantee to the Taft and only a 
six or seven percent contribution to the 
Chapel Square Mall development." 

Logue further said investments in 
downtown development alone will not 
really help New Haven where it needs 
help most. "Hartford is the classic ex-
ample that downtown development 
does not solve a city's most pressing 
problems. 
Hartford is 
the fourth 
richest financial center and fourth 
poorest city in the U.S. It has the 
fastest percentage growth of office 
space, yet it is the poorest city per 
1 fa pita. The Hartford community and 
city government are now proposing a 
'linkage concept' of investment: if you 
want to have a big development in 
H artford, you have to do something 
for the neighborhood. Business people 
are beginning to understand that this 
has to happen. We [in New Haven) 
don't even have the business leadership 
that Hartford has. It is in Yale's self-
interest to provide that leadership." 

The University has not followed this 
linkage concept, however. The 
Shubert Square project is a good ex-
ample of the type of large investment 
Yale is willing to make in New Haven. 
The project is supposed to create an 
entertainment district on 
College 
Street and attract prosperity to the 
area, though it has yet to benefit 
poorer city residents. Mayor Biagio 
DiLieto, in a presentation to the Board 
of Aldermen in 1982, spoke of the pro-
ject as a necessity: "We cannot afford 
the loss of more retail business. We do 
not want our downtown to be the dis-
count center of the metropolitan 
region. We do not want our downtown 
to shut down for the night at 6:00 
p.m." 

The Shubert Theater, the center-
piece of the project, opened last winter 
and the Palace opened in September 
1984. Profit, a business newsletter, 
hailed the Shubert's gala opening and 
predicted its benefit to New Haven 
business: "Y~u can park your car, have 
a meal, go dancing and drinking after. 
Money flows." 

But for many people in New Haven, 
the money does not flow or even trickle 
from the Shubert. The project has 
problems that could be inherent in 
Yale's other capital investments. First, 
the Shubert does not provide manY
