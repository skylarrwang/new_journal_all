munism in the United States. "Did you 
vote on November 6? See who's on the 
ballot? Gus Hall and Angela Davis," 
Peterson said. "Things like that just 
drive me up the wall. That's why the 
veterans usually tend to come toward 
our group, when they see something 
like that." 

The Klansman explained the source 
of his strong dislike for communism: 
"Probably Vietnam, and maybe wat-
ching 'M *A*S*H' on TV. Korea. I 
never liked people joking about war. 
Sitting there and it's a big joke about 
wounded people." 

Peterson himself 
never fought in Vietnam. "They did 
away with the draft when I turned 18 in 
1972, but I definitely would have gone. 
My brother got his draft number 
changed, so he went from number 3 to 
be drafted 
to 
number 
300-and-
something. My father hate him to this 
day." 

World War II has also had a great ef-
fect on Peterson, who now says, "The 
Nazis are a bunch of jerks. My father 
fought them in World War II, and my 
father was German but he came to the 
United States. What the Nazis tried to 
do I don't go along with at all. They 
were suppressing 
people. 
Nobody 
should be suppressed. I don't care 
whether you're black or white or J ewish 
or green, everybody's entitled to their 
freedom." 

Despite his claims that his organiza-
tion is not racist, Peterson believes that 
the white people are a "dying race." At 
the same time, his involvement in the 
KKK stems more from personal than 
social goals. "You join to get yourself 
written up in the history books. Once 
you get your name written in the 
newspapers you want to have it written 
every day. No matter where I go I'm 
associated with the IE. Every time the 
Klan ha!~ d rally there's somebody there 
and you can see it on TV. There's 
nothing more exciting than a room full 
of Klansmen drinking beer and watch-
ing themselves on TV." 

AJ Groth, former Invisible Empire 
Kleagle and a NUKKK leader, was 
born and raised in Connecticut. When 
he turned 17 he volunteered for military 
service and fought in Vietnam during 
the Tet offensives of 1967 and 1968. H e 
served as a Green Beret paratrooper 
sergeant and earned three Purple 
Hearts. "T wo of 'em I got hit by mortar 
shrapnel in the hands and back. The 
third, the kid who shined shoes every 
day shot me in the leg. H e was Viet 
Cong. A spy." Groth remembered 
racial friction among the American 
troops fighting in Vietnam. "Nobody 
got along. Everybody hated it over 
there. Most of the blacks over there 
were killed by our guys. The blacks 
were running away. 

"I volunteered because I thought I 
was doing something good," Groth con· 
t4nued. "Then I find out the govern· 
ment was just trying to get oil rights out 
of the land. I was treated like shit when 
I got back. By everybody. The real 
liberal people, people like the John 
Browners." 

As far as Groth is concerned, the 
communist invasion of the United 
States has already begun. "What the 
hell! They sent us over there and told us 
to kill 'em and now over here they're 
running for President. What kind of 
crap is that? We need some more guys 
like McCarthy in the Senate. I mean, 
it's supposed to be a free country." 

Groth, who left the IE with Peterson, 
does not have fond memories of Dillon. 
"Dillon was a Nazi; he's still got the 
swastika on his arm. Ask him how 
many bars he got them thrown out of 
for doing 'Heil Hiders.' He speaks Ger· 
man and got some good anti-Jew stuff. 
Get him a little looped and he'd go crazy 
on the Nazi shit. I can't stand that." 

Groth continued, "Dillon's also into 
black magic. He was locked up for a 
while. He flipped out- too much drugs 
or something. He tried to kill somebody 
or knife them or something like that. 
Dillon always tried to act tough. He'd 
say, 'Yeah, you should have seen me, I 
beat up six black guys last week.' But he 
never did. Dillon's got no guts." 

Groth provided a different version of 
what happened at Meriden than Dillon 
did. "That coon that beamed the girl 
with a rock- I got him with a Louisville 
Slugger right across the throat. I was 
going to fmish him off, but a cop grabb-
ed me and said 'One hit per nigger.' I 
thought that was a pretty funny thing to 
say. As we were leaving, we said, 
'Come on out and get us,' and we pulled 
out ARI5s and semi-automatic rifles. 


That's the first time I pulled a gun and 
didn't get no flack for it. 

"I've lost a couple of jobs because I've 
been chucked out by minorities," Groth 
said, with resentment, but he does not 
consider himself a racist, "I just hate 
niggers, but there are white niggers 
too." Groth believes the racial tensions 
present in American society will even-
tually lead to a violent showdown. "I'm 
sure the country will lead up to a race 
war. I've been prepared for years." 

Groth carries several guns with him, 
but he favors a .44 Magnum and a .9 
millimeter pistol. "I figure it you've got 
to shoot somebody and it comes right 
down to it, you might as well do a com-
plete job of it." 

When I first saw the KKK. sign I thought, 
«They've got to be kidding, or I'm really in 
trouble. This is Yale, a liberal arts school. "I 
don~ know which would have been worse-if 
they turned out to be the real Klan or who they 
actually were. And the thing is, they said they 
didn't think of it as racist. I said to the half-
Mexican guy, .«You don't think of it as racist? 
How can you think of it as not racist? The 
KKK persecutes Mexicans in Texas. How 
could you not understand?"' I said, "I'm an 
Asian female, I can't change the way I look. " 
And he said, "Well, you should change 
yourself." 

The three freshman vandals may 
think of the Klan as a relic from 
America's history, an organization of 
southern rednecks far removed from 
Yale's liberal arts world. Yet while 
these students consider the KKK no 
more than a college prank, Dillon, 
Peterson, Groth and their fellow Con-
necticut Klansmen will continue to 
don their white robes and rally for 
white rights only a few miles from cam-
pus. As Robert C. Scoggins, Emper-x 
of the Invisible Empire said, "T:-.e 
Klan's going to be here when the wor;d 
ends. Don't ever let anyone tell you dif-
ferent. "
