I came. back to the Old Campus from the 
library at 10:30 that night. That's when I 
saw the sign on my door. They'd taken that 
phony blood you get from drama productions 
and crossed out my name with it. And there 
were three big ktters-KKK -wn'tten in that 
phony blood on my door. 

The guys who did it thought it was all a 
big joke. I walked into my btdroom and looked 
at the wreckage and I just started to cry and cry 
and cry. I took this as a really personal attack 
against me. I mean, I was jn'endly with a 
coupk of them. 

The weird thing is I don't think they even 
lcnew what the •KKK• means. The guy whose 
itka it was is half-Mexican and a Catholic. 
How could he not undn-stand?

room was vandalized on October 29. 

Ironically the Ku Klux Klan had 
nothing directly to do with this incident, 
which the University's Executive Com-
mittee is now reviewing. The KKK of 
the 1980s shuns association with such 
overt acts of racism. Today's Klan is a 
polished, 
efficient and 
g rowing 
organization, working to broaden its 
appeal among white Americans. Since 
1970, Klan membership has doubled to 
nearly 10,000 members, flourishing 
even in Connecticut, a state usually 
considered free of the intense bigotry 
traditionally linked with the Klan. To-
day there are some 350-400 KKK 
members in Connecticut, more than in 
any other northern state. Though it is 
unlikely the Klan will have much direct 
impact at Yale, this year's vandalism 
shows the ramifications of an increasing 
KKK presence in Connecticut cannot 
be underestimated. 

David Duke, a handsome and articu-
late young graduate of Louisiana Sta.te 
"Nobody should be 
supressed. I don't 
care whether you're 
black or white or 
Jewish or green, 
everybodys entitled to 
their freedom." 
-Karl Peterson, leader of 
Northeast United Ku Klux 
Klan 
University, master minded the resur-
gence of the KKK. During his under-
graduate years at LSU Duke had 
paraded around campus in a Nazi 
uniform and was once arrested for 
possessing the makings of a homemade 
bomb. He took it upon himself in the 
early 1970s to revive the Klan, and his 
soft-sell racism soon became a media 
sensation. Duke successfully presented 
an essentially non-existent organiza-
tion, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, as a 
legitimate non-violent political force. 

Duke's right-hand man was Bill Wilkin-
son, a high school dropout who in 1976 
formed a Klan of his own, the Invisible 
Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, 
based in Louisiana. The Invisible Em-
pire (IE) soon outgrew the size of the 
original Knights and became the largest 
branch of the Klan in the nation. 

Bill Wilkinson's Invisible Empire 
claims it is merely a political organiza-
tion fighting for white rights, but until 
recently it was regarded as the most 
violent and dangerous Klan group. In 
1979 for instance, 100 of Wilkinson's 
Decatur, Alabama Klan members, 
armed with ax handles, clubs and lead 
pipes, 
confronted 
about 60 black 
members of the Southern Christian 
L~:adership Conference peacefully 
m11rching in protest of the rape convic-
tior of Tommy Lee Hines, a retarded 
black man. In the resulting riot some 30 
Bill Wilkinson, founder of the Invisible Empire 
shots were fired and four people were 
wounded. 

According to Randall 
Williams, director of a public interest 
group called Klanwatch, "Bill Wilkin-
son can stand there and make his speech 
on how 'we are simply a non-violent 
political organization' and then, as in 
Wrightsville, Georgia, 1980, two of his 
members will leave that speech, drive 
two miles down the road and shoot their 
. 12 gauge shotgun into th~ face of a 
nine-year-old black girl. Anybody who 
says he got into the Klan thinking he 
was getting into a political organization 
and intends to advance a political pur-
pose is either incredibly naive or a liar." 

Although racism is not unique to the 
South, the question remains how Con-
necticut became the Klan's northern 
stronghold. Wilkinson first established 
the Klan here in 1980 by exploiting a 
racially tense situation in Meriden, 
where disciplinary hearings were being 
held over the shooting of a young black 
man by a white policeman. The IE 
staged a march down Main Street in 
support of the officer and was attacked 
by members of John Brown's Interna-
tional Committee Against Racism (IN-
CAR), an often violent communist 
organization. The subsequent sym-
pathetic popular 
reaction, 
mostly 
among white blue-collar workers, gave 
the Klan a foothold in Connecticut. 

Media attention also gave the Invisible 
Empire credibility, and the group has 
been here ever since. 

John Dillon, the Invisible Empire's 
Great Titan in Connecticut, looked like 
the sterotypical Klansman; late 20s, 
longish hair, scruffy 
beard and 
mustache and numerous arm tatoos, in-
cluding the cross of the IE. He wore a 
baseball cap, vest, long-sleeved shirt,
