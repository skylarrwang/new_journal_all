EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
bass and drums, and a couple of six 
packs- instant rock and roll. The 
Beatles and the Stones both started out 
playing Chuck Berry tunes in some-
body's basement; if they could go all the 
way to the top, anyone could. That the 
dream of Everyman as artist, the dream 
that anybody who could bang out the 
chords to "Louie Louie" might one day, 
for one second, be a star, that this 
dream sometimes comes true is what 
rock and roll is all about. And it's 
democratic. America: the land where 
~y kid can grow up to be President, or, 
tf he's luckier, as big as Elvis. 

Now things have changed. Bands 
!pend more time in the studio than on 
the road, and you don't hear much rock 
and roll live these days. If you do you're 
hlore likely to see it in an arena the size 
of the New Haven Coliseum than a 
llnall club that offers personal contact. 
COmmunication and participation like 
the Grotto. People don't participate in 
~k any more. They listen to records 
~nstead of jamming in the garage. And 
if the medium is still the message, 
What's the message of a medium like
techno-pop? That modern man is 
estranged from his music. What hap-
pened to the days of human rock â€¢and 
roll, when instruments were played, not 
programmed? 

Well, on a Wednesday audition night 
at the Grotto when an unknown local 
band takes the stage, kicks out the jams 
and achieves those moments of stardom 
(even if it isn't Superstardom), the 
almost-gone days of rock as a radically 
democratic art form live again. For just 
one second the dream of Everyman as 
artist comes true. And it comes true at 
the Grotto.
