The steel door of the old brass works factory opened on a huge, empty room. A pigeon flew across the large space beneath the steel girders supporting the structure. Strips of blistered paint hung from them. Henry "Sam" · Chauncey, Jr., president of the non-profit Science Park Development Corporation (SPDC) and former secretary of Yale, stepped inside, escorting prospective investors through Science Park, the first high-technology complex in the nation created by a corporation, a university and a city. 

"If you believe universities are going to have a growing relationship with the business community, and I do, it may be that having that relationship in a neutral facility halfway between is a good thing," said Chauncey, '57, describing how Yale could benefit from its new neighbors. "If what has happened so far continues, there will be a ·variety of types of work here for Yale students, who could then supplement wages to pay for their education. Our presence might well induce Yale graduates to stay here permanently, especially if they've worked at Science Park as students. Then there's the neighborhood value- Science Park represents a major chunk of Yale's western perimeter. Any Improvement here is bound to benefit Yale." 

For Chauncey, one of the most important goals of the Park is to help revive the Dixwell-Newhallville neighborhood. "The worst result for ~ Science Park would be to have a high-~ class, modern scientific technical park l and not have a good influence on the ! neighborhood, a park that didn't create ; jobs and economic help." 

Located west of Science Hill on Sam Chauncey s Division Street, the industrial complex provides space for newly incorporated or "embryo" companies, light industrial plants and established firms. Science Park now offers its tenants computer, bookkeeping and secretarial assistance, telecommunication lines and access to investors. "There is no lack of venture capital in the United States today," s~id Chauncey. "There is no lack of good ideas. But there is a terrible lack of good management to implement them. These services will free an embryo company to concentrate on the real work." 

There are now 40 ·corporations housed on the 80-acre tract, with only 13 acres developed. Although Science Park lacks the futuristic glitter of other industrial complexes, it attracts about three inquiries each week from prospective settlers. "We currently can't j\CCept any new tenants unless they build," Chauncey explained later, as he sat in his office in Five Science Park, a renovated munitions factory built in 1912. SPDC has plans for opening a similar facility this winter. 

The hall outside Chauncey's office passes by such companies as the Olin Chemicals Medical Facility, Micro-Gene Systems, Aqua-Tech and American Sun Systems, and opens on another era, a sprawling empty factory room with desks piled in the corner. An unplugged water fountain stands by a column in the center, and light streams in through walls of windows. The whole building looked like this less than a decade ago, but now it is filled to capacity with 25 start-up companies. 

"I had no idea that it'd fill up so soon," Chauncey said. "Entrepreneurship in America is exploding. When I started this program virtually everyone I talked to thought I was a fool. Now they can see how it is possible." 

Before 1981 the prognosis for the site was grim. Between 1955 and 1981, 16,000 jobs had evaporated from the area's heavy manufacturing companies such as Olin and Winchester Repeating Arms, a number equal to Dixwell-Newhallville's population today. Unemployment and crime threatened to turn the neighborhood into a slum. 

Chauncey worked in the Yale administration for 24 years and served on the New Haven Development Commission for more than ten. He helped bring the SPDC together in an attempt to unite the diverse interests of the University, the city and the Olin Corporation, which donated 80 acres to the project. By the end of 1983, city, 28 The New journal/December 7, 1984 RCEE closes the gap between the neighborhood and the working world.
