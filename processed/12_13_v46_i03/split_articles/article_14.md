lem Community College and Lancaster, and 
worked part time for the rest of the semester. 
During the summer of 1986, he began working 
full time.
As the summer drew to a close, Smith found 
out that his wife was pregnant. In order to keep 
their health insurance, he needed to work full 
time, Smith said, “That was like, bust-ass time!” 
He spent sixty hours a week—twenty at school 
and forty at his job—blowing glass to support 
his growing family. He left the program after 
completing his second semes­
ter so that he could focus more 
on his job, so he graduated with 
a certificate as opposed to a 
degree. By that time, he was 
already building pieces for At­
mar’s regular catalogue, such 
as boiling flasks, addition fun­
nels, and drying apparatuses. 
His daughter Mallory was born 
in 1987, and her brother Pres­
ton followed two years later.
Smith often moved for 
work at the beginning of his 
career, but he set up a minia­
ture glass studio wherever he 
lived. One of his houses had an 
adjoining gray, two-story barn 
about the size of a one-car ga­
rage. He set up a torch on the 
second floor and worked on re­
pairs during nights and week­
ends. “It’s shaking in the wind,” 
Mallory said, recalling one day 
from her childhood. “But Dad’s 
up there with the radio on, 
blowing glass.” 
Mallory was six or sev­
en years old when she first 
learned how to use a glass­
blowing torch herself. Her 
father guided her hands for 
the first hour or so, and then 
stepped back, watching at a 
safe distance. She made mar­
bles, pendants, and Christmas 
ornaments. “It was a cool expe­
rience to have him say, ‘You are 
smart enough and trustworthy 
enough that you can handle 
this,’” Mallory said. Still, work­
ing with a flame frightened her. Making larg­
er pieces of glass required big flames. “When 
you’re knee-high with a grasshopper, you’re 
scared of it,” she said. Her younger brother 
was often there, right beside her. He learned to 
blow glass from his father as well.
Smith spent the next few years working for 
small glass companies on the east coast before 
he landed a job with Kontes Glass, the largest 
glass manufacturer in the United States at the 
time. At Kontes, Smith pushed his craft beyond 
standard scientific glassware and began mak­
Daryl Smith calls this torch the “workhorse of the 
glassblowing industry.”

ing more challenging or extravagant creations. 
He made yard-long test tubes with diameters 
as wide as your wrists. He was told that they 
were horse bloodletting tubes. “Oh my God, 
those things are huge!” Smith says in recollec­
tion. “Poor horse!” To this day, he doesn’t know 
who placed the order or why. “I kind of didn’t 
want to find out.” Smith made about two dozen. 
Each took twenty minutes.
After five years at Kontes, Smith heard 
about an opportunity too good to pass up. Word 
was spreading that Joe Luisi, the glassblowing 
instructor at Salem Community College, was 
retiring. “It was the job,” Smith said. His appli­
cation was accepted, and he started teaching in 
the fall of 2000. 
While Smith was an instructor, the college 
got rid of the one-year certificate program, 
keeping only the two-year degree. They deter­
mined that anyone who had completed the one-
year certificate program and attained signifi­
cant experience could receive the degree. “So I 
eventually got my associate of applied science 
while I was an instructor,” Smith said.
Smith enjoyed his job, but started to regret 
that he spent most of his time teaching as op­
posed to glassblowing: “I kind of missed build­
ing things—the gratification you get from mak­
ing the apparatus,” he said. After five years of 
teaching, he took a position at Yale that would 
allow him to both teach and blow glass. Smith 
fixes broken equipment and helps researchers 
with specialty pieces, in addition to teaching a 
workshop on the basics of scientific glassblow­
ing.
His class is always oversubscribed. It is 
listed as a graduate-level chemistry laboratory 
class but is open to all Yale students. This year, 
all of the participants happen to be graduate 
students in the chemistry department, but in 
past years workshop has been entirely under­
graduates. The semester follows the course of 
his daughter Mallory’s lessons: first they make 
marbles, then Christmas ornaments, before 
moving on to more advanced concepts.
Students also learn techniques that they 
can apply in their research. Louise Guard, a 
fourth-year chemistry graduate student who 
took Smith’s class last fall, learned how to seal 
samples of chemicals in glass chambers under 
vacuum to send out from the lab for outside 
analysis. “It’s especially helpful if he’s on holi­
day and you want to send some compounds out.”
Other skills take more time to master. Dur­

ing class on a Tuesday in early October, fifth-
year graduate student Sahr Kahn struggled to 
create a straight seal, which involves smoothly 
fusing two glass tubes together, end-to-end. 
Khan bemoaned her work—the glass had wrin­
kled near the attachment, where it should have 
been even. “You’re not going to master it in this 
class,” Smith reassured her, “It takes years.” He 
had taken four or five years to become profi­
cient at the technique. “What?” Khan whipped 
around, a mangled piece of glass tubing grasped 
in hand. “Okay, good!”
While Smith enjoys teaching, he came to 
Yale so that he would be able to get back be­
hind the torch. Often, his work simplifies oth­
erwise arduous processes. Guard walks around 
her laboratory, pointing at large apparatuses of 
connected glass tubes and pipes sitting behind 
fume hoods. “Without those, we couldn’t do any 
of our chemistry,” she says. These are Schlenk 
lines, which Smith builds for the lab. They have 
eight of these set-ups, which allow chemists 
to conduct reactions without air getting in the 
way. Otherwise, they would have to conduct 
their experiments in a glovebox, which would 
require them to use unwieldy rubber gloves to 
manipulate their samples. 
Some of Smith’s work is less routine. The 
strangest request he ever received came from 
Patricia Brennan, then a postdoc in the De­
partment of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology 
at Yale. Brennan, a graduate student, and re­
nowned ornithology professor Richard Prum, 
were studying the mechanics of the duck penis. 
In order to observe it in action, they needed a 
transparent alternative to a female duck’s gen­
italia. 
Silicone models were life-like, but too 
weak. “When we tested them with the males, 
the males actually broke through every single 
one,” Brennan said. “The conclusion is: they 
have an explosive eversion.” 
While a noteworthy observation, it also 
meant that Brennan and her team needed a 
different model. Brennan and her team ap­
proached Smith to request a glass duck vagina, 
which would be stronger but still transparent. 
Smith wasn’t as surprised as Brennan and her 
team thought he would be. He had made strange 
equipment before while working for Kontes 
Glass, including glass condom molds. And the 
glass vagina didn’t require any specialty tech­
niques. “It was just bending,” Smith said. Bren­
nan asked for a few different models: one was a 
straight tube; two more were spirals with three 
twists each; a fourth was short and squat, bent 
like an elbow. They didn’t exactly look like va­
ginas, Brennan concedes, but the geometry and 
shape were life-like enough for her purposes.
He is happy with his work, but Smith hopes 
to push the boundaries of glassblowing—maybe 
even beyond Earth’s atmosphere: he tells me he 
wants to be the first glassblower in space. With 
space technology advancing, he anticipates 
a need for an on-site glassblower, perhaps at 
a space station. “I hope they hurry up,” Smith 
said. “Because I’m getting older.”
Glassblowing in space could be a whole 
different art form. So much of the skill asso­
ciated with glassblowing is knowing how to 
turn pieces of hot glass, which would normally 
flow downward due to gravity, in order to off­
set gravity’s effects. “It’s so ingrained and so a 
necessary part of glassblowing,” Smith said. “To 
actually be in a non-gravity situation, and to 
see what it would be like and what you could do 
with it? Just wild. Mind-blowing.”
Until then, Smith will have to content him­
self with blowing glass on Earth, a life he en­
joys. “It’s like his natural habitat,” Mallory said. 
“Seeing my dad there, watching football on Sun­
days, cooking in the kitchen, or blowing glass—
he just owns the situation and looks completely 
in his element.” It’s the same at Yale, whether 
he’s making a round bottom on a glass tube us­
ing a hand torch or fusing a piece of tubing onto 
a spherical flask. His hands move by instinct, 
the radio always playing in the background, his 
concentration never wavering from the glass.
