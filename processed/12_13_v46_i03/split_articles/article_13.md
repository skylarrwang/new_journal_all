His Glass

at Yale.

our thin blue flames lick the underbelly 
of a glass flask as Daryl Smith steadies 
his blowtorch. With sweat dripping from 
his forehead, he directs the heat at one of 
three stumpy tubes attached to the spherical 
flask. The glass glows white-hot and starts to 
melt. Just as the tube begins to droop, Smith 
snatches it away with a pair of tweezers. The 
tube stretches until all that connects it to the 
flask is a long, thin thread. When the thread 
breaks, a spark of light appears as the chemical 
bonds in the glass split apart. The glass closes 
around the quarter-sized hole where the tube 
once was. During this minute-long part of the 
process, Smith has been holding a hose between 
his teeth that connects his mouth to the sphere. 
He breathes a puff of air into the sphere, and 
the hole reappears, leaving space for Smith to 
push the tube in again. He works without talk­
ing; the only noise in the studio comes from the 
jazz playing on a radio in the background.


A soft-spoken man with short brown hair, 
Smith is Yale’s scientific glassblower. He spends 
his days building and repairing glass laboratory 
equipment in a cramped room filled with a me­
chanical lathe, gas canisters, torches of differ­
ent shapes and sizes, and boxes of glass pipes, 
stoppers, and joints. Today’s job comes at the 
request of Timothy Newhouse, a chemistry pro­
fessor who inherited the flask, along with other 
old glassware, from another faculty member. 
He uses the flask to conduct chemical reactions 
isolated from the atmosphere. But he needed 
the protruding pipes replaced so that they were 
the same shape as and could plug into his other 
glass equipment.


Smith uses the lathe to rotate the sphere, 
bathing it uniformly in a blue flame from anoth­
er torch, to prevent it from cracking as it cools. 
The final step is to place the piece in a special 
oven that gradually heats and then cools the 
glass to strengthen it. After four hours, it will 
be ready for use in Newhouse’s lab.


Smith has been a glassblower for nearly 
twenty years. He grew up in Lancaster, Penn­
sylvania, a few hours away from southern New 
Jersey, the heart of the glassblowing industry. 
But he had never considered a career in glass­
blowing until after college. He was a year out 
of Texas A&M University when he came across 
an article in his local newspaper titled, “Glass 
Blowing: A Job With a Future.” It was 1985, and 
his job at the time in fisheries science had en­
couraged him to skew the data in favor of his 
employer, and Smith recalls thinking, “This is 
not science.” The article presented a lucrative 
alternative—and the chance to work with fire. 
When Smith moved to New York for his wife’s 
work two weeks later, he brought the clip with 
him.


Neither Smith nor his wife found success in 
New York. She didn’t get the job she had want­
ed; Smith started working for a furniture man­
ufacturing company, where he was passed over 
for a promotion. His thoughts kept straying 
back to the article. It had promised a starting 
salary of around thirty thousand dollars, the 
equivalent of over sixty thousand dollars to­
day. And North America’s only scientific glass­
blowing academic program, at New Jersey’s 
Salem Community College (SCC), happened to 
be within commuting distance of his in-laws in 
Pennsylvania.


But before applying to the program, Smith 
wanted to learn more about what scientific 
glassblowers actually did. So he talked with his 
father, a plant manager at Radio Corporation of 
America, and his brother, a graduate student at 
Rutgers, who both worked with scientific glass­
blowers. They told him that glass tradesmen 
are crucial to the maintenance of industry and 
research. “It sounded like something interest­
ing to do because it does involve some scientific 
training, and it does involve working with your 
hands,” Smith said. “I’ve always enjoyed that. So 
I gave it a shot.” He enrolled in SCC’s program in 
January of 1986.


The school still boasts the only academic 
program for scientific glassblowing in the 
United States. South Jersey was the birthplace 
of the glassblowing industry in colonial times. 
Located at the confluence of major shipping 
lanes, it’s where glassblowing grew up, says 
Dennis Briening, current chair of scientific 
glass technology at the community college. The 
program currently accepts forty-four students 
each year, who go on to work at institutions 
such as the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology and GE Global Research.


During his first few weeks at the college, 
Smith practiced making round bottoms on glass 
tubes and attaching tubes to each other at right 
angles. The work was, in Smith’s words, “im­
mensely boring,” but he didn’t give up. To learn 
more, he found a job at Atmar Glass, a small, 
family-owned glass shop halfway between Sa­
