to her, they brought in some young men who 
aren’t actively involved in violence, like her 
son, and they didn’t call in some young men who 
are. She seems uncomfortable with the basic 
premise of the program—that people should be 
accountable for the actions of their networks 
of friends.  

Second, she has no idea what the program 
does or how it works. If they’re trying to bring 
the community together to help fight violence, 
she says this program isn’t a good way to do it. 
Her son, who shows up mid-way through our 
conversation, received a letter from his proba­
tion officer about the call-in. He didn’t know 
what it was about, and didn’t want to show up, 
but his probation officer made him. “I don’t even 
understand what Longevity is,” Miller says. “Is 
it for drugs, is it for guns, is it for both?” 

Her son would not give me his name, and 
most people I spoke to who had been called in 
wanted to stay off the record. This, of course, 
helped explain why their voices were largely 
missing from the media coverage of Project 
Longevity. Because they wouldn’t give their 
names, it was difficult and often impossible to 
fact check their stories, or go back to them for 
more information. Their critiques lacked the 
specificity offered by the sociologists and po­
lice officers I spoke with, but ultimately, they 
were the ones with firsthand information about 
the experience of being called in. 

Miller’s son says the program doesn’t actu­
ally give people the tools to change. 
“It’s bullshit,” he says. He and other young 
men in the neighborhood were told to get off 
the streets—but no one can get a job, and, he 
says, the street is the only place to make a liv­
ing. He thought the social workers connected 
to Project Longevity would get people jobs, but 
they haven’t.
“Us being from the streets, we don’t know 
if they’re pushing their power,” he tells me. His 
criticism challenges the basic trade-off pro­
posed by Project Longevity—that the police 
will help you out with jobs and social services, 
if you’ll help them by not shooting. But to Mill­
er’s son, the power disparity between the police 
and the alleged gang members is so wide that 
a give-and-take model just seems unfair. How 
could he trust police after years of watching 
them round up his friends? 

The other Kensington Street residents who 
were called in to Project Longevity had similar 
criticisms. One young man in a red sweatshirt

is angry about the infringements on rights. He 
says the cops are targeting whole groups of 
people for individual crimes, even when many 
of those targeted have nothing to do with those 
crimes. He says he’s not in a gang and he doesn’t 
want to be treated as if he is.  The loose red 
sweatshirt he’s wearing now is the same one 
he was wearing recently when a cop stopped 
him and said he could go back to jail for wear­
ing red, because this is a Bloods area. But he just 
got out of jail, he says, and he has to wear what 
he has. Another teenager 
says he isn’t a Blood, and he 
doesn’t understand why he 
was called in as an alleged 
member of the gang. A third 
young man pulls a Project 
Longevity business card out 
of his pocket, and says the call-ins weren’t use­
ful because there was “too much police there.” 
The negative associations he had with the po­
lice were simply too strong to overcome in one 
meeting.  

When I tell Chief Esserman that some par­
ticipants feel like they are being wrongly iden­
tified as gang members just because they’re on 
probation and parole, he responds quickly and 
firmly. 
“They’re bullshitting you,” he says. “We 
didn’t just call you in because you’re on proba­
tion and parole, because how come we didn’t 
call in ninety percent of everyone on probation 
and parole?” Esserman says the Project Longev­
ity team did careful, precise research for the 
eleven months before the call-in. They went 
through five years of records. They did link 
analysis, creating maps of social networks. 
When I ask if it’s possible that they’ve made 
mistakes, or misidentified people, he says, 
sure—
“That bullet could have gone into their 
body by accident when they were in the Yale 
emergency room, and the guy we arrested and 
convicted for shooting them could have been 
wrong, and the gun could have been make-be­
lieve and they could have been from Mars and 
they really weren’t the person who was dying 
in the hospital that day.” He looks at me as if I 
could not be more naïve. 

He says his team is not “fishing,” that those 
called in were summoned for specific, re­
search-backed reasons. They are not dragging 
a net down Kensington Street, looking for poor 
people or black people or people with a crimi­
nal record. “We’re doing the exact opposite,” he 
says. “We’re surgeons.”
And even as some of the participants in 
Project Longevity say the program is at odds 
with the community’s interests, there are also 
residents on Kensington Street who agree 
with the police’s crime-fighting efforts. Gus, 
who works at the corner store, tells me the 
neighborhood has changed for the better, and 
that “the police are doing a good job.” A young 
mother named Mary says 
community policing can 
be frustrating, but she’s 
also grateful for their vigi­
lance, because she has a 
little girl. 	
“That’s why the cops 
are taking everyone,” she says. “’Cause we have 
to think of the children.”
	

Project Longevity isn’t taking every­
one. But the main challenge for the police is 
that their surgical work can look and feel to ev­
eryone else like an arbitrary round-up of all the 
young men in the neighborhood. 

Scot Esdaile, the president of the Connecti­
cut NAACP, is one of the most vocal critics of 
Project Longevity. He grew up in Newhallville, 
another neighborhood whose gang population 
has been targeted through the initiative. He 
says he knows everyone in the neighborhood, 
and that the kids who were called in com­
plained to him afterwards. 
“The kids said, ‘Scot, they brought us in, 
they bought us pizza and soda, and all they did 
was threaten us,’” Esdaile recalls. Esdaile is 
frustrated because he says the program seems 
like it was simply imposed by law enforcement 
without considering the input of the commu­
nity. 

Reverend Mathis and Chief Esserman con­
tend that they held a series of meetings with 
the community before they launched the ini­
tiative. They briefed local politicians, clergy 
members, and activists on Project Longevity, 
and asked particularly interested people to 
join the team. 

The debate over Project Longevity raises 
the question of what constitutes “the commu­
nity.” All the people I talk to are trying to speak 
for the community, either implicitly or explic­
itly: Scot Esdaile, Reverend Mathis, the New

Haven Police Department, the residents on 
Kensington Street. But the community is het­
erogeneous, and in this case, it’s divided. Even 
if Project Longevity is a thoughtful, precise 
program based on months of data collection, 
there is still the challenge of making sure those 
affected understand the program and support 
its results. 

It is much too early to tell what impact 
Project Longevity is going to make. The num­
bers in New Haven are small, and the call-ins 
only began a year ago. Its official evaluation 
will happen in three years, and will be con­
ducted by Professor Papachristos and a team of 
colleagues. They will determine the success of 
the program based on whether there is a statis­
tically significant reduction in shootings and 
arrests for violent crimes among the groups 
they’ve been working with. Papachristos’s re­
search team meets weekly and tracks every 
single shooting that occurs within the city, to 
determine whether or not it was gang-related. 
The team hopes to steadily collect enough data 
to establish if Project Longevity is helping to 
stop the shootings.  

One Sunday morning, I attend Reverend 
Mathis’s church service on Sperry Street, one 
block away from Kensington. The Springs of 
Life Giving Water Church is not large—it has 
only twelve chipped black pews in its center 
aisle—but it is lively. There is a full drum set 
and keyboard; the music is so loud I can’t quite 
hear what the fellow congregants say when we 
lean in to bless each other. Reverend Mathis 
wears a long black robe with red buttons. He 
wipes the sweat from his forehead as he deliv­
ers a spirited sermon and leads us to Hebrews 
10:24: “And let us consider how to stir up one 
another to love and good works, not neglecting 
to meet together, as is the habit of some, but 
encouraging one another, and all the more as 
you see the Day drawing near.” 

Reverend Mathis tells us that we must be 
encouragers for those around us who have lost 
their way. Seeing me in the audience, he adds 
to his sermon that Project Longevity is about 
encouraging the people who commit violence 
in New Haven to change their course; it is about 
showing them that the community cares about 
them, and is affected by them. 

In Reverend Mathis’s view, as in Project 
Longevity’s view, we are all our brothers’ keep­
ers. It is our job, as community members, or ser­
vice providers, or police officers, to steer gang 
members towards the right path.  It is up to 
those who can to prevent the man on his right 
from pulling the trigger, and to keep the man 
on his left from drawing a knife. 

But whether or not Project Longevity suc­
ceeds in numerical metrics, a question remains. 
How can a program overcome a divided commu­
nity and years of mutual mistrust between po­
lice and people on the street? When we discuss 
“community,” who is responsible for whom? 
There is an enormous gap between the people 
trying to provide encouragement and the peo­
ple who are supposed to receive it. Even while 
Reverend Mathis and Chief Esserman and a 
host of other leaders encourage gang members 
to be their brothers’ keepers, many of the par­
ticipants in Project Longevity don’t agree that 
they are brothers. They do not want to be kept.
