She interrupted me. “And that’s the op­
posite of what we’re trying to do with the pag­
eant,” she said. “It’s against bullying.”

I asked Belardo what she thought the dif­
ference was between the kind of judging that is 
implicit in bullying and the kind that makes up 
pageants.

“You’re bringing the best out of you,” she 
answered. “Your fashion sense, the way you 
express yourself.” Middle and high schoolers 
are disapproving rather than supportive in its 
judgment, she said, and without the confidence 
boosters of beauty pageants.

Belardo stumbled as she thought aloud 
about the drawbacks. “We should all equally 
win. I think that would be a better way…I’m not 
really sure.”

She ultimately answered that the way pag­
eants combat bullying is through the confi­
dence they give people to stand up on stage and 
know that “you don’t have to be accepted every­
where you go.”

When Belardo finishes my makeup, I am 
wearing so much I can see it in my peripheral 
vision. She shows me how I look in a compact 
mirror. My T-zone is now hairless and my eye­
brows don’t look dramatically different, just 
more even. Seeing the makeup, I understand 
for the first time why they call it “eyeshadow”—
the sparkly dark blue powder looks indeed like 
a long shadow cast by my eyes and extending 
almost up to the arches of my newly-slimmed 
brows. Belardo has extended the black eyeliner 
ever so slightly into the crow’s feet that ring the 
corners of my eyes.

“True beauty is what shines out when you 
compete,” I remember Patricia West saying to 
me. “You can have the most beautiful body and 
face. But if inside there’s not just a genuine love 
for others and community, you’re not going 
to look so pretty on stage. Pageants teach you 
about being a total package. You’re well-spo­
ken, give back to community, and you’re smart, 
and happen to be pretty.”

Everyone in the room tells me I look beauti­
ful and that my face will look dramatic from the 
audience’s perspective. They praise Belardo for 
her masterful work.

My friend Salma Dali, who is also compet­
ing, borrows my fanciest dress for pageant day. 
It is a fuchsia floor-length gown with a halter-
top, a criss-crossed back, and tiny jewels on 
the bust. When Salma answers her onstage 
question in it (“As a neuroscience lab assistant, 
what are your goals to make a change in our 
society?”), she looks beautiful, poised, and well-
meaning—everything this pageant loves. She 
wins the “Miss” division.

Yet Wong, the head judge, reveals that she 
had actually pegged me as her winner after the 
interview. I’m shocked by this. “You answered 
every question as if we were having a conver­
sation,” she said. “You didn’t come in expecting 
to win. You came in like, this is who I am, this is 
what I’m doing.”

Everything I’d been told about this pageant 
suggested that it was meant to give people the 
opportunity to work specifically on building 
self-confidence. But hearing the judge’s ratio­
nale still left me with questions about what it 
means to win pageants, why pageant culture 
rewards what it does, and what participants—
winners and losers—want from the experience. 
It seems that everybody gets something a little 
different. Through pageants, West has gained 
a substantial platform from which to promote 
her organization. Ross has learned how to ex­
ude grace and speak with poise on a stage. Car­
lina Moore has gotten to feel like a princess. 
All of them have chosen to do something 
that I learned is both nerve-wracking and dif­
ficult. They subscribe to a values system about 
responding to judgment with poise, and accept­
ing it. They believe that the skills necessary 
to excel in pageants are valuable outside the 
pageant world—and that within it, those fac­
tors can be evaluated, without making deeper, 
possibly damaging judgments about beauty or 
personality. They believe this with mission­
ary zeal, and though I don’t trust all the tenets 
of this religion, there is something about their 
faith that tugs at me.

I re-watch the video of my performance at 
the pageant. It’s both me, and distinctly not me. 
I remember shaking on stage, but that doesn’t 
come across. My voice hadn’t tremble as much 
as I’d thought it had. I walked faster than I was 
supposed to. I did smile awkwardly, like I was 
trying to show I’d understood a joke that I didn’t 
really get, when Carlina yelled, “Go, Arielle!” 
The audience clapped when I left.
