assistant to the executive director, says, “De­
cember is looking bad, and January is going 
to be worse.” A former Michigan resident and 
AmeriCorps volunteer, Durance moved to Con­
necticut to work at Christ Church Episcopal 
in downtown New Haven, which runs the soup 
kitchen. In that time, he’s seen the numbers 
of meals the kitchen serves jump. Now, in the 
last week of every month, the one-room dining 
hall prepares to serve an unprecedented three 
hundred lunches. Durance expects the figures 
will only increase as New Haven starts to feel 
the effects of the SNAP cuts. “Folks are feeling 
shunned,” he says, “We’re feeling unable to pro­
vide for a community we care about.”

David O’Sullivan, Durance’s soft-spoken 
boss, tells me that the clientele has changed 
considerably in the twenty-seven years he 
has worked at the kitchen. When he started, 
he says, the typical beneficiary was an older 
male with a drinking problem. Now, the people 
who come looking for a meal are, on the whole, 
younger, whiter, more well-to-do, and some­
times toting kids. “For a lot of the newer folks, 
you can sense the stress levels are higher,” he 
tells me. They come in asking for assistance 
the soup kitchen cannot provide—diapers, baby 
food, rent assistance. Though a SNAP coordi­
nator is sometimes on hand to direct them to 
the Department of Social Services, O’Sullivan 
says, “The government has stepped back.” The 
annual twenty thousand dollars in governmen­
tal funds that Christ Church Episcopal had re­
ceived for the past five years has been cut. Now 
the directors have to rely on grants, donations, 
and fundraisers.

I leave just as the first of the lunch crowd 
files in. They make their way towards stacks of 
bread and pots of hot food fresh from the ad­
joining stainless-steel kitchen. With Farm Bill 
cuts of anything between four and forty billion 
dollars over the next ten years, Durance fears 
that soup kitchens and food pantries will not 
be able to handle the demand. “They will close, 
unequivocally,” he says, with a hard look in his 
eyes. He hopes, however, that his kitchen will 
be an exception.

Those who cannot line up for cooked meals 
often stock their own fridges and cupboards 
with the help of food pantries instead. The fol­
lowing Saturday, I am standing in front of the 
Episcopal Church of St. Paul and St. James. The 
church runs Loaves & Fishes, the largest week­
ly New Haven pantry that allows its guests—as 
the program manager, Reverend Keith Voets, 
calls them—to pick out their own food. Voets 
had told me that people line up well before the 
pantry’s 9 a.m. opening. When I arrive at 8:30, 
there is already a line around the block. 

Inside, John Castillo, the church’s good-
natured caretaker, directs me to the serving 
area. A food stamp recipient himself, he seems 
mostly unfazed by the SNAP reduction: “It has 
caused me to cut back a little on red meat, but 
other than that it’s basically the same.” Yet the 
times are not easy for him: he tells me about his 
multiple sclerosis and how his household in­
cludes his six younger siblings, all in the same 
cheerful tones with which he had given me 
directions. Pay from the church is not enough 
for Castillo to go without assistance, but he 
says that New Haven has offered him much 
more support than New York, where he grew 
up. Plus, he insists, he fares better than some 
others who are struggling here. As we speak, 
someone in the next room yells, “We’re about to 
get started,” and the volunteers’ opening prayer 
drifts through the door: “Give us today our daily 
bread…”

Loaves & Fishes gets most of its food from 
the Connecticut Food Bank, one of two large 
food assistance banks in the state. The CT Food 
Bank, whose central location is in nearby East 
Haven, also relies on donations from local mar­
kets and growers. Government food provisions 
have run thin, and the decline is expected to 
continue. Neither the Food Bank nor the pan­
tries know how many of the people who come in 
are on food stamps, but with more cuts to come, 
CT Food Bank Communications Director Mary 
Ingarra says the Food Bank is expecting more 
of a strain on its programs.

Back in the volunteer area of Loaves & 
Fishes, the strain is visible. Volunteers shuttle 
around quickly, cutting pie for guests and bag­
ging bread to deliver to elderly people at home. 
A teenage girl hurtles by, saying, “We have an 
egg spill. Eggs are down.” A white-haired man 
peers out of the kitchen to ask, “Does anyone 
know how to make coffee in these things?” 
Another, wearing a pink sweater and jeans, de­
clares, “Straight-up chaotic today.” 

In the next room, a volunteer holds up num­
bered laminated papers to make sure guests 
reach the food tables in an orderly fashion.

Individuals who arrive with their own bags 
get an extra item from a table with Thanks­
giving staples like stove-top turkey stuffing, 
while the rest move on to the standard fare: 
packets of rice, cans of sweet corn and green 
beans, bags of potatoes, and fresh zucchini. A 
chart on the wall displays pictures and labels of 
lesser-known fruits and vegetables, including 
yucca and various kinds of yautía—presumably 
part of the young new reverend’s plan to make 
guests’ diets more nutritious. Loaves & Fishes 
also runs a small free medical clinic, and the 
rates of diabetes and obesity that volunteers 
see are staggering, Voets says.

Two older women cross in front of me. 
“Venga por aquí,” one says to the other. An­
other woman runs forward saying, “Wait, wait, 
wait,” before grabbing the hand of a small child. 
Loaves & Fishes does not ask any questions of 
its guests, so it does not have statistics on its 
clients’ demographics, but one can observe the 
people who mill about. The pink-sweatered 
volunteer declares that many are drug addicts 
who trade in their SNAP swipes for cash at local 
grocery stores and then show up at the pantry. 
Nationally, only one cent on every SNAP dollar 
spent is illegally exchanged for cash, a fraud 
rate that has dropped in recent years. Both 
Voets and volunteer captain Sally Fleming tell 
me that many of their guests are working poor, 
people with one or more low-wage jobs who still 
struggle to make ends meet. Fleming, a small, 
gray-haired woman who slips in and out of sight 
as other volunteers ask for her assistance, says, 
“I don’t think anyone’s starving, but there are 
certain families that run out of food and have 
to live on pasta by the end of the month.”


For the homeless, who have nowhere to 
store food or cook meals, options are even more 
limited. Yet the shelters they turn to are not 
always able to provide the food they need. At 
Columbus House, one of New Haven’s largest 
homeless shelters and social service organiza­
tions, Paula Bowe explains that she is border­
line diabetic, and it’s crucial that she maintains 
a healthy diet—with fresh vegetables, lean 
meat, fish, and not too many carbs—to prevent 
the disease from worsening. “It’s the stuff that 
you’re not supposed to have that you can afford,” 
she says, seated at a table in the shelter’s office 
space. Columbus House Intake Specialist Mar­
tha Deeds, a young woman with short-cropped 
blonde hair, points out that though homeless­
ness often exacerbates people’s health issues, 
the shelter cannot cater to all dietary restric­
tions. “The options are limited,” she says. 

Bowe speaks vehemently about her fight 
to support herself—and her adult disabled 
son—within the system she depends on. She 
lost her longtime job as a clerk at Stop & Shop 
three years ago, after a car accident sent her to 
the hospital. She lived off savings and settle­
ment money for months, but both have run out, 
forcing her to seek help at Columbus House. 
She struggled with the Department of Social 
Services; her SNAP benefits were cut off when 
her renewal form was sent to her old mailbox. 
When she applied again, the office misplaced 
her documents. Like others, she has become 
jaded: “If my body would let me, I’d rather work 
eighty hours a week than deal with the federal 
or the state government.” I ask her about the 
department’s new office, which has made use 
of a statewide system to manage clients’ ac­
counts online and a new scanning process to 
prevent lost documents. There’s more staff and 
wait times have decreased significantly, but af­
ter her fight, Bowe remains skeptical: “It’s the 
same old welfare office.”

Work is hard to come by for Bowe, giv­
en that she cannot operate a computer eas­
ily, which she says is required for most jobs. 
Though the state has stepped in to cover her 
future rent, paying utilities without an income 
is impossible. She hopes to move out of Colum­
bus House as soon as possible, but she worries 
that even with a kitchen, she will struggle to 
prepare healthy meals. For now, she practices 
her computer skills in the hopes of finding em­
ployment.

To successfully advocate against future 
cuts, those affected need to tell their stories, 
says William Bromage, chair of the Food As­
sistance Working Group, and they need to do it 
well: “Everyone can tell their story, but not ev­
eryone can do it concisely and powerfully.” 
The group is part of the New Haven Food 
Policy Council, which has banded together with 
local nonprofits to train a few people to do so. 
The twelve chosen food advocates come from 
all over New Haven, and most rely on assis­
tance—whether from SNAP, soup kitchens, or 
food pantries. In October, they attended a five-
hour training session to learn how to speak at

a legislative hearing, write letters to newspa­
per editors, and reach out to fellow community 
members. 

The advocates are paid for an eleven-hour 
internship, anything from attending confer­
ences to assisting with surveys to—I’m un­
nerved to learn—speaking with reporters. But 
Bromage points out that the $12.50-per-hour 
compensation is necessary when dealing with 
such a low-income population. There are, of 
course, barriers to what they can do. At one 
council meeting, food advocate Kimberly Hart 
complains, “Policymakers can testify for hours. 
When I testify? Three minutes.” And perhaps 
there is some heartstring-pulling. 

Patricia Stuart, who lives in Fair Haven, is 
another one of the food advocates. Initially she 
speaks of the food stamp cuts with resignation: 
“There’s no sense in trying to fight it, because 
you won’t win.” But she attended part of the 
food advocate meetings, and plans to return. 
Among people like her, there’s a sense of col­
lective vulnerability. The poor, especially those 
who struggle with multiple jobs or imperma­
nent housing, are often not the ones closely 
following federal debates. Faraway politicians 
hand down decisions, and the consequences, 
announced in the formal language of legisla­
tion, translate to a lost gallon of milk, or one 
more bruised tomato. 

The food advocates are just a handful of 
New Haven citizens, but they represent many 
others. In conversation, they tell the stories 
of people—a friend with kids, a woman in the 
street, a couple featured in the paper—who are 
struggling more than they are. They speak not 
the language of policymakers but instead the 
language of empty shopping carts and skipped 
meals. Their perspective, they hope, will 
change the spirit of the debate—if lawmakers 
hear them.
