EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
There are many ways to sleep that are not
restful.  There are lakes that are open
or closed in different seasons as though
by some kind of door. 

Tonight the eels migrate: 
they know where they are going: 
they have been there once before.  
They are like sound particles traveling 
outward from a single source, acquiring 
the behavior of the space they 
interact with, now returning less loudly 
back to the place they came from 
in order that they may be heard.  I turn the lock
against the eels, scatter salt: 
my house is not a sea. 

One could sleep all night through 
the migration, a sharp instrument 
in one’s hand, as if a dream were a way 
to measure the angle between two objects: 
one real, and one wriggling, slow 
but urgent, across the frost and asphalt,
making an undecipherable sound.


**Title: I Can Imagine a Terrific Rain**
**Author: Elliah Heifetz**

I can imagine a terrific rain and ten thousand people screaming in 
the Canadian north. All of my professors are there and the wind is 
actually so strong that it breaks my arms. In the same way that I 
hate my body, I see a wide disc of earth covered with people that I 
know, screaming, launched from the surface of the earth towards 
Prince Edward Island or into green waters near Ellesmere Island.
Where are my shoes? I lie in your bed while you rinse, my head in 
halves like a nut and rain cutting me long-ways. Walking north 
towards Newfoundland, I see everything from up top sluiced by a 
horrific rain over the Baffin Bay, completely destroyed by nature. 
You unplug a quarter inch from the stereo and wrap it up. In the 
yellow light, you throw me a glance in passing. 

When I continue to do worse than everybody else, I have visions 
of lines of rain across my neighborhood. I sleep because I smoke 
enough weed but otherwise I watch the flood make cleavages in 
the earth. It is so frustrating to me that I am not miles away in 
Greenland, refrigerating with the birches like a tired buoy – that 
far north I think I could myself be a work of art, at least an ice 
sculpture bobbing forever.
