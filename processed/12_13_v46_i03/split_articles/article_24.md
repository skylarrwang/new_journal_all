they felt that nursing was just an extension of 
that male-created role.” Cassandra, an explic­
itly radical movement, valued nurses’ ability to 
nurture their patients while providing quality 
health care. Liberal feminists objected to this 
emphasis on traditionally feminine qualities.

Chinn seems to look back on that time 
with fondness, despite her frustration. It was a 
heady time, she says, when feminism felt new 
but was “starting to really blossom.” Earlier in 
her career, she had worked as a pediatric nurse 
at a hospital, but hated it. “It was like nurses 
didn’t have a brain and should just be a robot,” 
she explained. They were expected just to carry 
out the tasks they were given. She spent a few 
years in a physician’s office, which offered a 
better workplace, and then moved on to teach­
ing college- and graduate-level courses in nurs­
ing at the University of Buffalo, and then at the 
University of Connecticut. “I knew I wanted 
to teach differently,” she explained. Inspired 
by Paulo Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed, 
she developed a teaching technique that saw 
education as a process of solving problems, not 
memorizing information. It meant asking ques­
tions, and not necessarily having the answers.

Almost all of the nurses I talked to seemed 
satisfied with the technical aspects of their 
nursing education—the skills and the science. 
But they can face some unlikely adversaries 
in their non-nursing peers. Madeleine Wilson, 
a senior undergraduate nursing major at Penn 
unaffiliated with the Rebellious Nursing move­
ment, describes her high-school self as a “very 
typical, straight-A, AP student that wanted 
to be a premed and have my elite life set out.” 
When her mother suggested the idea of nurs­
ing, she hated it. “No way someone like me who 
is top of the class is going to consider it,” she re­
members thinking. She ultimately decided on 
nursing after being won over by the opportuni­
ties and faculty at Penn. Now, nearing the end 
of her undergraduate nursing degree with a mi­
nor in health care management from Wharton, 
she has spent four years hearing that attitude 
reflected in her peers’ opinions on nursing. “I 
get a lot of shit about how nursing is easier—
‘why don’t you be a doctor?’” she explains.

Sometimes this tension plays out in institu­
tional dynamics. Lola Pellegrino, who graduat­
ed from the school of nursing last year, told me 
found herself feeling uncomfortable in some 
of her classes. Once, she tells me, jokingly, a 
class on psychiatric nursing was so hetero- and 
gender-normative that she “wanted to throw a 
Molotov cocktail at the Powerpoint” in one par­
ticular lecture.

an early avenue for women to be part of Yale: 
it was founded in 1923 as the first autonomous 
school of nursing in the country, and all eight 
of its deans have been women. YSN is progres­
sive in many ways: it has a strong community 
of LGBT students, a respected midwifery pro­
gram, and an academic approach that recogniz­
es nursing as an important academic—as well 
as practical—field. 

The Yale School of Nursing is far removed 
from the rest of the university. The school’s 
move this October to Yale’s “West Campus” site 
in Orange, Connecticut—a twenty-minute drive 
from our bench on Cross Campus—allowed the 
school to expand and improve its facilities, but 
it also moved the school away from the rest of 
Yale’s medical community. The seven-mile dis­
tance between the nursing school and the med­
ical school seems to reflect stark differences 
in resource distribution. Commenting on the 
move, YSN nurse-midwife student Emily Mar­
tyn says she no longer feels like she is “in the 
middle of the medical community.” But while 
nurses undertake rigorous courses and provide 
important care, in the eyes of some, they will al­
ways be “just nurses.” 

Beyond anatomy and physiology, it’s clear 
that there are bigger lessons that need to be 
taught in nursing school. After all, there’s no 
“Racism, Sexism, Ageism, and Homophobia 
101,” but these problems are just as serious, 
many rebellious nurses might contend, as any 
medical emergency. Like illness itself, health 
disparities among minority or disadvantaged 
populations also bring suffering—just on a 
slower, and often more insidious, level. These 
societal problems are particularly dangerous in 
the life-or-death medical world. 

That brings them to the elephant in the 
room: money. Nurses stare huge economic ob­
stacles in the face on a daily basis. Health care 
is expensive, and people will often go without 
it if money’s tight. For patients on Medicaid or 
other forms of government-funded health in­
surance, reimbursement rates are so low that 
providers must see patients in rapid succes­
sion, which leads to lower-quality care. “You 
might not realize that something’s going on,” 
Martyn says. “You have to actually sit with a 
patient to hear what they have to say and give 
them the care they deserve.” For many provid­
ers and patients, taking that time is simply im­
possible. Obamacare, Pellegrino says, will “push 
us there…It’s a step in the right direction,” but 
change will likely be slow.

Even the division of labor between doctors 
and nurses reflects economic tensions: nurses, 
Chinn says, have the most power when they are 
“taking care of people who no one else wants 
to take care of”—that is, populations that don’t 
bring in money. For example, nurses have a lot 
of latitude when working on a Native American 
reservation, but in mainstream environments 
where they can compete with nurse-midwives 
and nurse-anesthesiologists, their authority is 
limited. And traditional avenues of advocacy 
might not be available, since most nurses aren’t 
unionized. The nation’s largest nursing union, 
Nurses United, will only accept nurses with 
certain credentials, excluding many nurses and 
medical professionals. 

Chinn is blunt: “Systems are set up by phy­
sicians or administrators who are out to make 
the most profit. As long as our health care sys­
tem is a profit-based system, this kind of thing 
is going to happen”—that is, quality of care will 
be affected by who can pay for it and how much 
doctors will make.

Emma Dorsey, a nursing student at Penn, 
tells me that she came to the conference be­
cause she believes that nursing is a radical 
profession and wanted to “connect with other 
radical nurses, learn from them, draw strength 
from them, and have some fun.” She writes 
that she gained “all of the above” as well a tat­
too. Her biggest unanswered questions: “What 
next?  Can we make a publication? Can we have 
another? More, please! More! How can we make 
more nurse-managed clinics and build a radical 
health option for the poor?”

For Dorsey and others, this is the state of 
living and working in the space between ques­
tions and the answers. What gets these nurses 
from shift to shift is their renewed sense of 
purpose: the idea that new conversations can 
take place in emergency rooms, in clinics, and 
across the profession. I had gone to find the 
revolution, and I’m still trying to make sense of 
what I saw.  But the work of building a healthier 
world might just start with rebellion.
