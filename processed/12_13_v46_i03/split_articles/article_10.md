mingle with futons and bedspreads. 

Drifting in a sea of establishments that 
cater to adults with cars and steady employ­
ment, sixty-four-year-old Zito has spent much 
of his long career thinking of creative ways to 
draw Yale students up Whalley. Despite years 
of mixed success, he is convinced that students 
would love the shop—if they’d just walk past 
Popeye’s to find it.  

Rubber Match has a decidedly sixties vibe, 
which Zito notes ought to appeal to college 
students nostalgic for a decade they never ex­
perienced. Signs out front saying “Undefeated 
Champs!” and “Introducing George-O-Pedic 
Memory Foam!” are printed in colorful, bubbly 
lettering that begs to be described as “groovy.” 
At the back of the first floor, a head shop coun­
ter offers hookahs, tobacco, and a variety of 
marijuana paraphernalia. A Yale sophomore 
named David Rico visited the shop early last 
fall and noted that the furniture store and 
head shop seem oddly segregated, united only 
by their presence under the same roof. Zito, 
however, believes the inventory to work well 
together.
“I call it ‘beds and heads,’” he said of his busi­
ness model. “We couldn’t say that in the eight­
ies.”

Zito offers discounts to Yale students and 
free delivery directly to dorm rooms. Aaron 
Gertler, a Yale junior, purchased a futon there 
for his suite this year. He said he paid less than 
a comparable futon at IKEA would have cost. He 
was also pleased when Zito himself delivered 
the futon within thirty minutes. 

As the shop’s owner, marketing strategist, 
and primary salesperson, Zito is perhaps Rub­
ber Match’s most intriguing draw. The heavy-set 
grandson of Italian immigrants, Zito is New Ha­
ven born and raised, and not embarrassed to tell 
one story after the other about himself and his 
time here: the time he entered a waterbed in a 
charity bed race down the New Haven Green to 
generate publicity, the time he gave money to a 
homeless man who then became a preacher and 
repaid the money years later, the time he saved 
a Yale student from a mugging by hurling a club 
across Whalley Avenue. He corroborates many of 
these stories with newspaper clippings saved in 
binders on his desk or framed on Rubber Match’s 
walls, but they retain mythic proportions. 

“People like to claim that New Haven kind 
of lacks that small-town charm, and certainly 
Yale has done a great job of commercializing 
it into chain store oblivion,” Gertler said. “But 
I think there are opportunities for people to 
get some of that small-town charm back, and I 
think one of the ways to do that is by shopping 
at a place that’s been here since Kingman Brew­
ster was keeping things cool with the Black 
Panthers in the late seventies.”

Zito thinks the museum is already starting 
to bring in new customers—but even if that’s 
true, he will mostly just be making up recently 
lost ground. The arrival of IKEA in 2004 to New 
Haven’s retail scene amplified the challenge 
posed by Rubber Match’s physical distance from 
campus. Zito estimates his sales in the months 
of August and September, when students gen­
erally outfit their common rooms with futons 
and beanbag chairs, have been down by ten to 
fifteen thousand dollars since IKEA opened. He 
seems to relish the challenge of turning back 
the clock. 

“This for years has been my fight: how do I 
get my business back again?” Zito said. “I don’t 
know if we’re going to get it back, but we’re go­
ing to get a bigger market share soon.”

Zito’s confidence aside, Rubber Match is 
still not widely known on Yale’s campus. After 
more than forty years in business, Zito feels 
that it’s time to finally solve the puzzle of how 
to lure students far enough up Whalley to see 
his futons, his hookahs, his Jim Morrison fin­
gerprints, and the pictures of his grandchil­
dren. He says that if the Rock ‘n’ Roll Museum 
doesn’t work, he’ll think of something else. Af­
ter all, in the natural ebb and flow of a college’s 
population, seniors depart each May and fresh­
men arrive each August, ready to be persuaded 
to buy futons and hookahs, and perhaps even a 
waterbed. Meanwhile, Rubber Match floats on.
