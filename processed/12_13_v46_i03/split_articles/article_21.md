EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
On November 26, 2012, twenty-five alleged members of two of the most violent gangs in New Ha­
ven filed into the Hall of Records, an imposing stone building with wide white columns on Orange 
Street. At the door, Reverend William Mathis greeted the young people, all of whom were on probation 
or parole. Those twenty-five were about to attend the first “call-in” of Project Longevity, a new police 
initiative that has come to exemplify the practical challenges even the most progressive anti-violence 
programs face. 


New Haven is a small city with a high homicide rate. Between 2003 and 2012, 185 people were 
killed in the city. In 2011, violence reached a twenty-year high, with thirty-four homicides and 133 
non-fatal shootings. At the end of that year, the mayor hired a new chief of police, Dean Esserman, and 
gave him clear orders: stop the shootings. 


Esserman already knew New Haven well. He had been the assistant chief of police in the nineties, 
when he helped institute community policing in every area. Cops walked neighborhood beats instead 
of driving in circles, gathered intelligence on gang leaders instead of petty criminals, and steered 
people towards social services instead of jail. In 1993, Esserman left for a job in New York. The depart­
ment’s budget was cut and subsequent chiefs reverted to more traditional law enforcement methods, 
which saturated violent areas with police and racked up arrests.


Now Esserman is back, and so is community policing. In 2012, he helped launch Project Longevity, 
a program that, though widely praised, has left some in the community feeling unfairly targeted and 
unwilling to buy in. 


For eleven months before the first call-in, a 
team of cops, detectives, academics, and activ­
ists studied the perpetrators and victims of the 
worst violence in New Haven. Officially, these 
are “groups,” just a step or two above cliques, 
and not “gangs,” which are fairly established, 
with an internally-recognized hierarchy. The 
team went through five years of police records. 
They interviewed neighborhood cops, proba­
tion and parole officers, federal agents, and 
family members. They analyzed relationships 
between individuals. If you murdered Jim, they 
asked, who else was in the car? What was your 
relationship with Jim before the shooting? Who 
do you hang out with? 


The cops used to just track down and ar­
rest an individual in connection to a crime, but 
Project Longevity has expanded the scope of 
their inquiry. Police can react to a gang-related 
murder by focusing their attention on an entire 
network. And the police aren’t working alone—
state and federal law enforcement have also 
promised to crack down on whole groups who 
do not heed Project Longevity’s message.  


In November, Project Longevity brought in 
alleged gang members for a two-hour meeting. 
They displayed the initiative’s “table of organi­
zation” they had created over the past eleven 
months, a map of relationships that visually 
linked each person in the room. The team’s mes­
sage was clear: we know who you are. We know 
who your friends are. The body count ends now. 


“The first of you who goes to kill—we don’t 
just go after you,” Esserman says, summarizing 
his speech at the first call-in for me one after­
noon in his office. “We go after all of you. You 
might not be responsible for the murder, but 
you are responsible for being part of the gang. 
Look to your left and look to your right—you are 
your brother’s and your sister’s keeper. What 
one does, the gang pays for.” 


Project Longevity’s “focused deterrence” 
approach originated in Boston in the nineties 
with David Kennedy, now a professor at the 
John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New 
York. In his book Don’t Shoot, Kennedy writes 
that the people committing violent crimes are 
“not an entire generation, not everybody in 
the hot neighborhoods, not all the young black 
men. Not everybody exposed to violent video 
games or rap. Not everybody from a single-par­
ent family. Not everybody who could get a gun 
if they wanted one.” 


Focused deterrence is based on a com­
mon pattern identified by criminologists: the 
overwhelming majority of violence in cities is 
caused by a very small percentage of the popu­
lation that moves in identifiable groups. The 
opposite of focused deterrence is general de­
terrence—the “stop and frisk” program in New 
York City, for example, which was recently 
declared unconstitutional by a federal appeals 
court—where everyone gets police attention, 
whether or not they are violent offenders. 


According to a 2009 New Yorker article, 
Kennedy began developing the roots of what 
would become the Project Longevity strategy 
in 1994, when the National Institute of Justice 
gave him and two colleagues a grant to study 
gang violence in Boston. Kennedy met Paul 
Joyce, the leader of a city police unit focused on 
gangs. Joyce had been quietly and successfully 
reducing homicides among some of Boston’s 
most violent gangs. 


Joyce had realized that law enforcement 
officials and punitive measures alone couldn’t 
make people stop shooting. No matter how long 
prison sentences were, or how many young men 
got arrested, the number of homicides stayed 
constant. But if people with moral authority in 
the community—local clergy, grandmothers, 
and victims of violence—told violent offenders 
to stop shooting, they were more likely to listen. 


Kennedy studied Joyce’s tactics for six 
months, eventually developing a framework 
for focused deterrence as a citywide program. 
Instead of asking cops to deliver informal noti­
fications to individual gang members, Kennedy 
and his colleagues designed a forum—the call-
in—where they identified members of gangs 
to come together and hear the clear message: 
if one member of a gang commits murder, the 
whole unit will be placed under a microscope. 


Five months after the first call-in, the homicide 
rate had gone down by seventy-one percent. 
People started calling it “The Boston Miracle.” 


The first person I met who had been “called 
in” to Project Longevity, Sean, seemed to be a 
homegrown New Haven miracle. I was taking a 
sociology class called “The Urban Street Gang” 
with Project Longevity researcher and Yale 
professor Andrew Papachristos, who identi­
fies gang members in New Haven and analyz-


es their links to each other. We learned about 
Project Longevity from four panelists: Rever­
end Mathis, the director of the program; Doug 
Bethea, a street outreach worker whose son 
was murdered in 2006; Thomas McDaniels, who 
founded a support group for grieving family 
members called “Fathers Cry Too”; and Bethea’s 
son Sean, a twenty-two-year-old convicted fel­
on who was on probation and had been called in 
to one of Project Longevity’s first meetings. 


Sean sat quietly at our seminar table while 
Reverend Mathis explained the basics of the 
program. Then it was Sean’s turn to speak. He 
told us that in 2009 he went to jail for robbery; 
he has since been released and is now on pro­
bation until 2015. His probation officer man­
dated he attend Project 
Longevity’s meeting. He 
has since moved out of 
his old neighborhood, he 
dresses differently, and 
he doesn’t hang out with 
the same people.
“I 
wanna 
change,” 
Sean said. “I don’t wanna die out here.”  


The people in charge of Project Longevity 
are optimistic that there are many others like 
Sean who want to change, and who will change. 
Reverend Mathis said that the program will 
lead violent offenders to “life—and life more 
abundantly.” Attorney General Eric Holder gave 
a press conference in New Haven the day after 
attending the city’s first call-in and said, “Proj­
ect Longevity will send a powerful message to 
those who would harm their fellow citizens.” 


Chief Esserman said Project Longevity will 
have a profound effect on the relationship be­
tween the community and the police because 
“the community—in the full light of day—sees 
us giving their children a second chance.” 


As I learned more about the program, I 
found that the voices of one central constituen­
cy are absent from the media coverage. Where 
were the people who had been called in? What 
were they saying?


Reverend Mathis would not release the 
names of the call-in invitees, and neither would 
Professor Papachristos or Barbara Tinney, 
who leads Project Longevity’s social services. 
The formal avenues had failed, so I went to the 
street. 


Kensington Street is a wide city street a few 
blocks west of downtown New Haven. Large 
white and beige houses with two-story porches 
are interspersed with brick apartment build­
ings and smaller row houses. At Kensington 
and Chapel, a steady flow of people enter Dux 
Market to buy cigarettes and lottery tickets, 
or stand by the curb to catch up with neighbor­
hood friends.  


The consensus among the residents I speak 
with is that Kensington Street used to be crazy. 
Asia and Joshua, who look about eighteen and 
are standing by a grassy park halfway down 
the street, say the neighborhood used to be 
so crowded, you could look to either side and 
only see people. Gus, a middle-aged man who 
works at Dux, says there used to be people sell­
ing drugs outside his shop 
in broad daylight. An older 
woman tells me in the eight­
ies Kensington was “really 
rough.” 


Everyone 
agrees 
that 
Kensington is calmer than it 
used to be, though the cause 
and timing of this transformation are up for 
debate. Some say it happened a year ago, when 
everyone got arrested; others say it happened 
eight years ago, when everyone got arrested. 


When I walk down to Kensington one after­
noon, there are clusters of people sitting on 
stoops, hanging out in yards, pushing strollers, 
and leaning out of parked-car windows. 


Laquanna Miller is standing outside her 
sister’s house, watching her two-year-old neph­
ew Tramire. Miller remembers standing on the 
porch of this same house in October, when a 
drive-by shooter on Kensington accidentally 
shot Tramire in the chest. The bullet fractured 
his pelvis and caused citywide outrage. Today 
Tramire is grinning, wearing a blue sweatshirt. 


Miller’s son was called in to Project Longev­
ity, and she has less than glowing things to say 
about the program. 


“Basically, I don’t think it’s working,” she 
says. “Still people getting shot, still people sell­
ing drugs.”


Her criticisms are two-fold: first, by going 
through the probation and parole lists, the re­
searchers and cops working on Project Longev­
ity aren’t necessarily targeting people actively 
making trouble on the street. 


“Just because you hang in the area doesn’t 
mean you’re in a gang,” Miller says. According
