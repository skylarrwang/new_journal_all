trant works with a facilitator from Emerge. 
The facilitator serves as a coach, motivator, 
and support system, which has led to dramatic 
results: in some cases, Justino says, individuals 
have advanced one grade level in just twenty-
four hours of coursework.


“Real Talk,” the third component of the pro­
gram, encourages reentrants to work through 
problems from their past and present through 
discussion groups. For Justino, a goal of these 
talks is for reentrants to shed what he refers to 
as “angry black man face.” He says, “It served us 
well in our communities. It kept us alive in the 
hood, in the yard. But where we’re headed, it no 
longer serves us well.”


Reentrants work through unresolved child­
hood traumas that continue to affect their be­
havior. Over twenty-five percent of the men 
have struggled with substance abuse that has 
never been addressed, and many, including Jus­
tino himself, have struggled with mental health 
issues. “Two months ago, these guys were sit­
ting in the yard,” Justino tells me. “And now, 
they’re beginning to talk about abuse, and more 
importantly, how to stop it here, how to not per­
petrate it on their children. That’s the magic.”


Anthony Torres, a quiet 22-year-old with 
soft eyes, came to Emerge four months ago. For 
him, Real Talk also presents an opportunity 
to work through problems with his co-work­
ers. Upon arriving at Emerge, he immediately 
clashed with another reentrant. But he has 
learned how to sort out conflicts. “We’re grown 
ups, we can talk stuff out to reach a better out­
come,” Torres says. “Our communication has 
now grown a lot, and he’s actually a pretty good 
guy. We just hadn’t gotten to know each other.”


Emerge only reaches sixty men per year, 
and both Justino and Woodcock are uncertain 
if their resources can effectively support a 
larger program. The small size fosters a strong 
sense of community, as the men help one an­
other in the field and at the table during “Real 
Talk.” But the success of the program depends 
on each reentrant’s commitment. Justino cites 
Darius Jones as one of the organization’s suc­
cess stories, calling him Emerge’s “poster child.” 
He first arrived at Emerge when it began three 
years ago after learning about it through his pa­
role officer. After going through Emerge, Jones 
received a degree in business administration 
from Gateway Community College, and became 
the organization’s bookkeeper.


Sitting in the office in a neat brown polo 
shirt, tapping away at his computer, Jones tells 
me that the police gave him a lot of trouble 
where he grew up, in Wellington, Connecticut. 
I’m surprised when Justino interrupts: 
“That’s easy to blame them. What was your role, 
what was your fifty percent? I can’t change 
that police officer. That’s as useless as sitting 
in a rocking chair and hoping to get to Manhat­
tan. It ain’t happening.” Then he asks, “The only 
thing you can change is who?”


“Myself.”


“That’s right. Don’t ever forget that.”


Reentrants are taught to carry this at­
titude out of the program and into the rest of 
their lives. But however often Justino and the 
staff repeat the words, they remain difficult to 
practice. Though Emerge ensures that former 
prisoners are no longer abandoned at the door 
of the Whalley Avenue jail, and helps them gain 
skills and a community, individuals face the 
ongoing challenge of making their way in the 
world.
