“C
ontestant number 19.” The announc­
er’s 
amplified 
voice 
reverberates 
through the auditorium. I look down 
at the number pinned to my dress. My legs 
snap into position, and I begin my walk into the 
bright light: one and a half large circles around 
the stage, just as I practiced this morning. I try 
to smile at the three female judges seated at a 
table below me and at the audience in rows of 
school cafeteria chairs beyond, but it’s the me­
chanical smile of a news anchor. When I pose 
for the first time, stiffly shifting my weight 
leftward, everybody claps. I’m not sure what 
they’re clapping for. 

My legs jitter as I walk, even though my 
sparkly heels are only two inches high. An 
iridescent mother-of-pearl necklace hangs 
around my neck. My satin dress swishes qui­
etly. I’m wearing more eye makeup than I ever 
have in my life. And yet, I have a strange feel­
ing—novel to me—that from where the judges 
and audience are sitting, I look beautiful, enig­
matic, older, even seductive. 

After completing my circuit, I stop in front 
of the pageant’s creator and emcee, Logan West.
 “If you could change one thing about so­
ciety’s attitude toward women, what would it 
be?” West asks, passing me the microphone.
Three empty seconds pass. 
“I think I would want everyone to be able 
to define feminism for him or herself,” I begin, 
my voice trembling. “I think that that’s sort of a 
loaded word, umm, and unfortunately, it usual­
ly has negative connotations. And I would love 
for everybody to be able to think about what 
fen-fenim-feminism means for him or her and 
to be able to express that.” I pass the micro­
phone back to West and exit the stage. 

A few weeks earlier, I would have answered 
West’s question very differently: “Make society 
stop objectifying women through institutions 
like beauty pageants.” But I was also curious 
about their widespread allure, to the point of 
entering a pageant myself: the 2013 Connecti­
cut USA Extravaganza Pageant in New Haven. 
Maybe pageants offered  more ways to be beau­
tiful than I’d realized.
The Miss America pageant began in 1921 
as an Atlantic City summer resort festival. That 
first year, fifteen-year-old Margaret Gorman 
was crowned the winner because the judges 
deemed her capable of handling the responsi­
bilities of motherhood. Girls like Gorman rep­
resented an idea of American morality expect­
ed to hold the nation together after World War 
I in the age of Jay Gatsby, jazz, and the flapper’s 
loosening sexuality. Women had won the right 
to vote just the year before. In the twenties and 
thirties, Miss America winners exemplified 
conservative definitions of femininity: docile, 
unassuming, and chaste. 

The expectations for contestants have 
changed. The women who compete must per­
form a talent and have a social platform that 
they would use their title to promote. An oft-
cited fact about the Miss America Organiza­
tion is that it is the top scholarship provider for 
young women, doling out more than forty mil­
lion dollars each year. A re­
cent ad for the organization 
featured a young woman in 
a strapless dress holding 
a tiara, looking up at the 
words: “Some people call 
her a beauty queen. We call 
her a scholar.” Many of the 
women who have won the 
pageant in the last decade 
have been college graduates hoping to finance 
an education in law, medicine, or another pro­
fessional field. All of them have professed pas­
sion for community service. All of them have 
been confident and well-spoken. 

But does the proclaimed shift in values re­
ally reflect a deeper change in pageant philoso­
phy?
Logan West, a junior commercial dance ma­
jor at Pace University, claims that her pageant, 
the Connecticut USA Extravaganza Pageant, is 
different.
“I don’t really think it’s about the glitz and 
the glamour that most people expect. It’s re­
ally a fundraiser for my program, Unite Against 
Bullies Today.”
That’s how West billed her project to a Fox 
Connecticut news anchor in a September inter­
view. She insisted on the ways that her pageant 
didn’t fit the stereotype. Like many pageants, 
it included an interview, a swimsuit competi­
tion, an evening gown competition, and an op­
tional talent portion. But “swimwear” could be 
interpreted so loosely as to mean “anything you 
would wear to the beach.” It was open to boys 
and girls, men and women of (literally) all ages. 
And the forty-five-dollar entry fee supported 
a good cause, the anti-bullying organization 
West started when she was fourteen. The pag­
eant system isn’t based on judging the bodies 
of young women; with its alternative rules and 
overwhelmingly positive branding, West saw 
her pageant as a potential force for good.
At nineteen years old, West knows a thing 
or two about pageants, and the mainstream 
pageant circuit. In 2012, she won a crown at 
Miss Teen USA—a giant, pink-jeweled tiara, and 
a glimmering sash, to be specific. The title came 
with a $25,000 check. Originally from South­
ington, Connecticut, she became the first girl 
from the state ever to win the title. 

West spent the following year serving as a 
figurehead of the Miss Uni­
verse Organization.
During her reign, she 
promoted 
Unite 
Against 
Bullies Today, which teach­
es students in grades three 
through seven how to rec­
ognize and stop bullying us­
ing a five-step plan. School 
principals were much more 
willing to let her into classrooms to conduct 
anti-bullying workshops when Miss Teen USA 
was calling.
West and I Skyped a few weeks before the 
Extravaganza Pageant. Sitting in her Pace Uni­
versity dorm room, she looked nothing like she 
did in her TV appearances: no makeup, hair 
tucked away in a bun, body swallowed by a gi­
gantic gray sweatshirt, eyes framed by rect­
angular glasses. Her voice was still a bit nasal 
from the cold she’d had earlier in the week.
“I’m just a normal girl. I went to a normal 
school. I go to a normal college,” she said. “I just 
get to wear a crown sometimes.”
West had won a local pageant when she was 
four years old, but didn’t return again until she 
was thirteen, the year she started being bullied 
for not “acting her race.” West is the daughter 
of a white father and African-American moth­
er. For six months, another biracial girl in her 
class criticized her tastes in music, her friends, 
and her clothing—then slammed her into lock­
ers and spat on her. West entered the Miss 
America pageant system as a way to reclaim 
herself post-bullying. She was judged there too, 
but this time she was told that her clothes, her 
manner, and her opinions were right. Although
