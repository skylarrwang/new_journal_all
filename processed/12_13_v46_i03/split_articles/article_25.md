As you write course evaluations for your fall 
classes or read them compulsively to pick your 
spring ones (and then throughout the semes­
ter to bask in what could have been), pick and 
choose from these categories of answers to: 
“How would you summarize this course for a 
fellow student? Would you recommend it to an­
other student? Why or why not?” 

These quotes are real. So is their pain and their 
ecstasy.   

Short & sweet:
Sure

Matter of fact: 
I would recommend [Ethnography of Ev­
eryday Political Life] for those interested in 
learning about what it’s like to be a politician, 
to be involved in the political world, and what it 
takes to be a politician. Also those interested in 
ethnography.

Overdramatic:
To say this was a bad class is an understate­
ment akin to “the ocean is wet.” Without a doubt 
it was the worst educational experience, if one 
can call it that, I have suffered since the sev­
enth grade 

Ass-kissing:
American Novel should be called Amy’s 
Book Club because it feels less like a class than 
an enjoyable commitment to becoming more 
cultured and well-read 

Openly hateful:
          you might as well google figure drawing and 
learn from that.

Warning: 
if you don’t like dancing in front of people, 
avoid it. He’ll make you dance, no matter where 
you hide.

Rambly:
This is the worst class I’ve taken at Yale…I 
wish its terribleness had revealed itself before 
the drop period ended...I hated every minute 
of the purgatory that was taking place in front 
of me…This is nothing you haven’t seen in a 
Malcolm Gladwell book…Worst of all, there’s 
no Internet in YUAG, so you have no choice but 
to sit and suffer without even the respite of 
Sporcle…He takes 15 minutes to start lecture 
every day, often giving information he already 
emailed to us. He’ll acknowledge that he sent 
this information in an email, AND THEN RE­
PEAT IT AGAIN WORD FOR WORD. He goes off 
on random tangents during class; I once timed 
it, and he spent 18 minutes discussing a prena­
tal class he took before his kid was born. Once, 
we wasted 40 minutes playing the Prisoners’ 
Dilemma; what Yale student HASN’T heard of 
the Prisoners’ Dilemma? How many times must 
we look at the covers of Neal Stephenson books 
just so you can make some stupid puns? …Over­
all, I’ll probably do well in this class. Heck, I’ll 
probably get an A. But was it worth it? Was the 
soul-crushing agony and slow torturous death 
of my passion worth it? Absolutely not. 

Befuddling:
It squeezes all the major western philo­
sophical ideas into my mind in one year and it 
really helped me to think better like a real man.

And the lingering historical grudge:
I would recommend [The Civil War & Re­
construction, 1845-77} to Yankees.
