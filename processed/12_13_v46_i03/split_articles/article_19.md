n a small apartment in Fair Haven, Patricia 
Stuart goes to get a letter from her bedroom. 
Family Feud plays in the background as she 
emerges with an envelope in hand, and begins 
to read in a low, gravelly voice: “In accordance 
with the American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act of 2009, maximum allotments can only 
remain the same each year until the regular 
Thrifty Food Plan adjustment increased allot­
ments above those set by the Recovery Act.” 
In comprehensible terms, the news is bad: her 
food stamp benefits have been cut from two 
hundred dollars a month to $189. 
“What are we supposed to do?” she had 
asked soon after I walked in. Stuart, a tall, mid­
dle-aged woman wearing a colorful robe, spends 
most days at home or in the doctor’s office. Seat­
ed at her living room table, she shows me why 
she has been out of work for the last few years—
she cannot lift her right arm more than a couple 
of inches. “Just moving it hurts right now,” she 
says softly, before laying it gently back in her 
lap. When she needs to leave the apartment, 
her goddaughter drives her, because taking the 
bus causes panic attacks. She places the letter 
alongside financial statements, pill bottles, and 
a bouquet of plastic roses. 

Stuart is one of over 36,000 New Haven 
residents who receive food stamps, officially 
known as SNAP benefits, through the Supple­
mental Nutrition Assistance Program. In 2009, 
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 
gave people like her across the country ex­
tra food dollars to get them through the hard 
times of the recession. That temporary boost 
ended on November 1, forcing many to adjust 
their budgets. Legislators had assumed that the 
economy would pick up by the law’s expiration 
date, but in the New Haven, unemployment has 
stubbornly remained at twelve percent, and the 
cost of living has gone up. Some Connecticut 
representatives are part of the battle: Repre­
sentative Rosa DeLauro has protested vehe­
mently against additional reductions, and Sen­
ator Chris Murphy made headlines for eating 
on a SNAP budget for nearly a week last spring.

Since the cuts, Stuart has kept an especially 
sharp eye out for coupons and sales. She bought 
five pounds of potatoes and a five-pound bag of 
flour for ninety-nine cents each at ShopRite. 
Once a month, she stops at a food pantry to get 
additional supplies. “I don’t eat too much of the 
fresh stuff,” she notes. In fact, she tries not to 
each too much at all. She grows weary when I 
mention that under the Farm Bill being debated 
in Congress, several billion food stamp dollars 
may be cut once more.


On a map of food insecurity in Con­
necticut, New Haven is a dark stain, indicating 
that people here are worse off than those in the 
rest of the state. The portion of city residents 
on food stamps has approached thirty percent 
in the past few years, and the problem is wors­
ened by governmental disorder. In the spring of 
2013, a federal judge ordered that the Connect­
icut Department of Social Services (DSS) fix its 
“systemic deficiencies,” including illegally long 
wait times and frequent loss of applications. 
But by the numbers, fewer people go hun­
gry in Connecticut than in other parts of the 
country. In New Haven, the DSS has embarked 
a path of modernization, and nongovernmen­
tal resources are also readily available to resi­
dents. There are numerous soup kitchens, food 
pantries, and shelters. People spend at farmers’ 
markets, which double the value of their SNAP 
dollars and give them greater access to fresh 
fruits and vegetables. When asked if people 
are hungry in New Haven, Robert Jackson, a 
supervisor at the New Haven Community Soup 
Kitchen, says they shouldn’t be.  Holding a mop 
in his emptied dining hall, he notes matter-of-
factly: “There are so many places that feed you.” 
But the lines keep getting longer. With the 
food stamp cuts arriving right before Thanks­
giving and not long before the winter cold, peo­
ple have turned increasingly toward nonprofit 
aid. The city’s charitable network finds itself 
spread thin.
