W
hen Dan Justino addresses you, he re­
peats your name at least twice, once 
toward the beginning, and again at the 
end. “Juan, come talk to Lara here. Come over, 
Juan,” Justino calls to Juan Figueroa, a small 
35-year-old with jet-black hair. Other than his 
tan work boots, he wears all black. When asked 
what his first impression of Justino, his boss, 
was, Figueora immediately responds in a soft-
spoken voice: “Intimidating.” Two nearby work­
ers nod in agreement. Justino believes in hon­
esty and has a strict “no-bullshit” policy. He’s 
not afraid to tell his employees when they’re 
not working hard enough—or tell me when I’ve 
asked the wrong question. This delicate bal­
ance of power and intimacy serves Justino well 
with the population he works with: recently re­
leased prisoners. 

New Haven suffers from a dearth of re­
sources for former prisoners and a high recidi­
vism rate. After release, prisoners are generally 
dropped off in front of the Whalley Avenue jail 
and must find their own way from there. Often, 
they have no form of identification or home. 
Many return to crime, leading to a recidivism 
rate of sixty-five percent, much steeper than 
the nationwide rate of forty percent, according 
to Justino.

The New Haven Prison Reentry Initiative 
coordinates the efforts of various government 
nonprofits to lower the city’s recidivism rate. 
Emerge, the program Justino directs, is its 
newest member. Since its founding a year ago, 
Emerge has helped former prisoners through 
the often lonely and unwieldy process of rein­
tegration.

At Emerge, reentrants are employed at ten 
dollars an hour in construction jobs. The occu­
pation primarily attracts males, but Justino has 
considered opening a bakery to bring women 
into the program. Participants take online 
classes to become proficient in math and read­
ing at the tenth and eleventh grade levels. Re­
entrants also attend weekly discussions called 
“Real Talk,” to discuss topics like mental health, 
addiction, or childhood trauma. Justino, an ex-
offender himself, leads the group each Friday 
morning aiming to understand how each indi­
vidual landed behind bars, and how he can keep 
himself from being sent back.

Alden Woodcock is responsible for inter­
viewing each candidate and determining his 
potential to thrive at Emerge. A clean-shaven, 
young white man who dons large square glasses 
and smiles often, Woodock said he looks for re­
entrants who are committed to their own suc­
cess in the program. “The first question I ask 
everyone I interview for this job is, ‘Do you have 
another bid in you?’” Woodcock said. “And if 
they hesitate, then they’re not in the program. 
The ones that say, ‘I’m done. I need this,’ those 
are the guys that I’m excited to work with.” 

Emerge is designed to act as an individual­
ized bridge program between prison and per­
manent employment. It was launched in 2010 
under the umbrella of a city initiative called 
Empower New Haven before becoming inde­
pendent in 2012. The program was modeled 
after San Francisco’s Delancey Street Founda­
tion, which has rehabilitated ex-convicts, drug 
addicts, and the homeless for over forty years. 
The foundation currently operates a café and 
restaurant, catering and limousine services, a 
landscaping business, and a moving and truck­
ing company, each staffed by reentrants and 
people who have struggled with substance 
abuse. A portion of the profits helps cover hous­
ing, food, and clothing costs for the employees. 

Emerge tries to fill a void in New Haven 
with its combination of employment, educa­
tion, and character-building. This personalized 
model mandates that each individual carry 
a performance journal on the job to jot down 
notes about the day’s work. They turn it over 
to Woodcock, who reads each journal to follow 
each reentrant’s progress and interviews each 
reentrant to talk about how he has progressed 
and how he can continue to improve. Since its 
inception, the program has seen a twelve per­
cent recidivism rate among its participants, a 
significant drop from the statewide average of 
sixty-nine percent.

Emerge’s construction teams work on 
projects in six New Haven neighborhoods. Em­
ployees work three days a week for a total of 
twenty-five hours per week. Justino limits the 
number of work hours to remind reentrants 
that this should be a stepping-stone, not a per­
manent job. “It gives them incentive to leave 
us,” he said. Some find jobs in construction 
similar to their work at Emerge, while others 
go into completely different industries. Several 
Emerge employees have found permanent em­
ployment with the administration at Emerge.

Justino recruits many participants through 
parole and probation officers, but most par­
ticipants find out about the program through 
word-of-mouth. The crew members wear bright 
orange vests that advertise “Emerge” in bold 
lettering across the back, with C.O.R.E. just 
below it, signifying “Community Offender Re-
entry Experience.” Justino credits visibility as 
the main recruitment tactic. Most importantly, 
they work in neighborhoods that have some 
of the highest incarceration rates in the state, 
neighborhoods many Emerge members have at 
some point called home. 

For Roger Johnson, a soft-spoken thirty-
three-year-old, a friend’s orange vests worked. 
Johnson, who served a fourteen-year sentence 
for committing manslaughter, was released and 
then saw federal agents round up a group of his 
friends. They were being incarcerated again for 
alleged drug-dealing and murder. “That was a 
sign that I needed to get serious about chang­
ing my life, or I was going to end up in the same 
boat as my friends,” Johnson said. “I wasn’t firm­
ly rooted. I was dibbling and dabbling, moving 
to and fro. I needed structure.” This convinced 
him to follow his friend’s lead and join Emerge.

He has now been at Emerge for eighteen 
months, where he supervises a twelve-man 
work crew. Each work crew is supervised by a 
reentrant, who serves as both a role model and 
a leader, to promote a healthier relationship 
with authority. “They can hang out, they can be 
boys on the street,” Justino said. “But here, this 
is work. He’s a supervisor. He’s my enforcer.”

Yet some important distinctions remain 
between this program and conventional work 
settings. Justino recognizes that offering the 
men temporary employment is not enough to 
get reentrants on their feet for good. In order 
to improve full-time opportunities, one day 
each week is dedicated to academic education, 
until participants test at tenth- or eleventh-
grade reading and math levels. Once they do 
so, they can have those hours back for work, 
creating a financial incentive to complete the 
education component of the program. Since 
October 2012, Emerge has used Khan Academy, 
a nonprofit education website created in 2006 
by MIT and Harvard Business School graduate 
Salman Khan. There are no teachers, since Jus­
tino said they unintentionally made reentrants 
feel belittled in the past. Instead, each reen
