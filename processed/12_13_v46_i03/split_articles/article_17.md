she has only ever done six pageants total, she’s 
won five out of the six. The exception was Miss 
America’s Outstanding Teen, a national title. 
The rules stipulated that she couldn’t enter 
herself in the contest again, but West was ea­
ger to win a national title. Doing so meant she 
had to switch to the Miss Universe system, and 
her mother and coach, Patricia West, was con­
cerned about that change. The Miss USA sys­
tem is more explicitly focused on beauty than 
Miss America: it doesn’t include a talent por­
tion or award scholarship money, and doesn’t 
ask contestants to have a social platform. 
“I’ve always told the girls, don’t rely on your 
beauty,” Patricia, who also coaches her other 
daughters, told me. “You’re going to have to 
have something more to back it up.”


Patricia supported Logan anyway, driving 
her to a martial arts center in West Haven five 
days a week so that she could get in shape with 
a world-class fitness coach for the dance por­
tion of her training. Every day, she drilled West 
on questions about current events to keep her 
up-to-date and able to express her opinions elo­
quently. “If you talk to me too quickly, I’ll say, 
‘Start that sentence over again.’ I know I can 
drive my kids absolutely insane,” Patricia said—
but she’s proud of the results, and she believes 
in pageants. “They force you to stay up on cur­
rent events, to know who you are, to know what 
you stand for.”


Then she made me an unexpected proposi­
tion:
“Have you considered entering the pageant 
yourself?”


I clammed up, then. I balked, making some 
excuses, stammering.  Finally, I took a deep 
breath. “I’ll think about it.”


A week later, I say yes.


I am not the first person Patricia has con­
vinced to give pageants a try. Her converts in­
clude Patrick Moore, the 2013 Extravaganza’s 
co-director, who met the Wests after a Tae 
Kwon Do class at the West Haven martial arts 
center (where Logan trained for Miss Teen 
USA). At the time, Moore didn’t know much 
about beauty pageants, but he knew he didn’t 
want his then four-year-old daughter Carlina 
to enter any. But Patricia convinced him to con­

sider the 2012 Extravaganza. 


In the months that followed, Moore worked 
on interview questions with his daughter a few 
nights a week. Questions necessitated explana­
tions. “Why is purple your favorite color?” he 
would ask her. He explained to me, “You bring 
it down to the fact that grapes are my favorite 
food and I like sunsets, so I like purple,” he said. 
“You have to bring it down to that level.” Some­
times, exhausted and impatient, Carlina cried, 
so they would pause in her practice. 


But Moore felt it was a vital supplement to 
her education. “What course in school do you 
take to get on stage and demonstrate inter­
viewing techniques under pressure?” he asked 
me.  “If she was uncomfortable with it, we would 
take a break for couple of days. We had no ex­
pectations of winning anything.” Carlina won 
the four- to six-year-old age division, as well as 
an award for Best Interview, beating out con­
testants nine years older than her.


I wait for my interview in the 2013 Extrav­
aganza Pageant, sitting in the airy auditorium-
cum-cafeteria at the John C. Daniels Interna­
tional School. The seven other contestants in 
the “Miss” (unmarried female adult) category 
gather around one of the lunch tables. Among 
us are a twenty-five-year old model, a bulldog 
breeder, a junior from Southern Connecticut 
State University (SCSU), and two of my friends 
from Yale (Patricia and Moore strongly encour­
aged me to get my friends to sign up). The judg­
es call us in one by one.


At the table with me is 24-year-old Tayler 
Ross, who I had met before the pageant itself. 
She’s been doing pageants since she was five, 
but she tells me the interview portion always 
freaks her out. Ross is the real reason my two 
friends and I are in this pageant; Moore had 
given me her contact information when I had 
only just learned about the pageant. During our 
interview a month ago, she’d promised to help 
me if I entered: “I’ve always wanted to coach 
someone and see if my coaching helped them 
do better.”  She then worked with me on two 
skills that her six-month-old baby, Jayana—also 
a pageant contestant—would be acquiring soon: 
walking and talking.


 “So let’s see your heels,” Ross said first 
while I pulled out my wedges. She donned four-
inch gray suede stilettos. Cuing up a Justin Tim­
berlake song on her tablet, she demonstrated 
her walk: a series of deliberate bounces, each 
step replacing the one before it in a seemingly 
straight line. She looked natural and unaffect­
ed. At the end of her walk, she twirled elegantly 
without once breaking eye contact. When it was 
my turn, I was supposed to follow her lead while 
also crafting a walk that somehow “expressed 
my personality.” Instead, I tried to replicate 
Ross’s movements.


With that, Ross quickly moved on to inter­

view practice. 
“Arielle, tell me what it’s like being a tour 
guide at the Yale Art Gallery. What is your fa­
vorite piece of art?”


I started babbling about a Futurist painting 
of an amusement park, but Ross interrupted me.
“Yoo-hoo, where are you looking?” My gaze 
had strayed to the side to avoid eye contact. 
“Eyes right here.” She pointed to her own eyes. 
She added that I had already said too many 
“umms” and “likes” and that I was connecting 
all my sentences with “and” instead of pausing 
between ideas. She had me try again.


It turned out Ross was a good coach. In 
front of the judge panel at the 2013 Connecti­
cut USA Extravaganza Pageant interview, head 
judge Liz Wong asks me the same exact art gal­
lery question. I feel confident when answer­
ing, making sure to pause be­
tween sentences.


But 
the 
judges’ 
next 
brings me to a stumbling halt.
“At this point in the pag­
eant, what is the title of your 
article going to be?”
 “Oh, good, good question.” 
I stall. The judges chuckle. 
“Maybe something like ‘judg­
ing beauty.’”


Knowing that I’d come 
in to test the beauty pageant world, their re­
sponse had been to test me.


In the afternoon comes the onstage com­
ponent of the pageant. Wong told me that girls 
win pageants from the neck up. “You only have 
the stage for fifteen seconds,” she said. “If you 
can get a judge to only focus on your face be­
cause you are exuding that much confidence 
and positivity, by the time you come offstage, as 
a judge I’m like, ‘Oh my gosh, I forgot to look at 
her body.’ It really isn’t about what you’re wear­
ing. It’s about what your face is doing.”


Still, I choose not to walk onstage in a biki­
ni. I wear a modest one-piece and on top of that, 
I wear a cover-up that probably sheaths more 
of my body than my evening gown will. I don’t 
want to feel like a piece of meat, and luckily 
I’ve entered a pageant that will forgive—even 
support—that impulse. At Patrick’s encourage­
ment, all of the contestants in the Miss catego­
ry are wearing cover-ups except for one.


The swimsuit portion is my first walk of the 
competition. When I get onstage, I’m distracted 
by the lyrics of the Keri Hilson song playing 
over the loudspeakers, “Don’t Hate Me ‘Cause 
I’m Beautiful.” (“All eyes on me when I walk in,/ 
No question that this girl’s a ten,/ Don’t hate 
me ‘cause I’m beautiful.”) I’m walking too fast. 
I pose awkwardly. I don’t know when to smile, 
when to look at the judges or the audience. 
My body feels like a machine whose manual I 
haven’t bothered to read. Distracted, I forget to 
do the graceful final turn that I practiced this 
morning and walk offstage abruptly.


Before the evening gown competition, I ask 
Angelica Belardo, the SCSU junior, if she will do 
my makeup. Five minutes later, she is thread­
ing my eyebrows. 


I’m terrified. I can wash makeup away, but 
my eyebrows are not going to grow for a long 
time, according to an­
other 
contestant. 
She 
says I won’t have to pluck 
them again for a month 
after they’re threaded. 
I’m touched when Belar­
do, seeing the concern on 
my face, apologizes for 
throwing all of this at me 
at once.


This is her first beau­
ty pageant, too. Belardo 
signed up wanting to support the anti-bully­
ing cause. She had told me about being bullied 
from the age of twelve through her senior year 
of high school. Her friends spread rumors us­
ing instant messaging, and talked about her 
at school. She would come home crying, and 
dreaded having to return the next day. 
“I didn’t really think of it as bullying,” Belar­
do had told when we talked before the pageant. 
“I thought of it as drama, and one of the normal 
things that people go through. It’s something 
that adolescents do.”


Her experience shaped her interest in 
how the mind works, leading to her major in 
psychology. Belardo hopes to get a master’s in 
social work, and eventually work with teenag­
ers who struggle with depression or substance 
abuse.


When we came to a discussion of my inter­
est in the pageant, I had told her I wanted to test 
my preconceived notions—that I came into the 
experience with a belief that beauty pageants 
were outdated, objectifying, and judgmental. 
I’m walking too fast. I 
pose awkwardly. I don’t 
know when to smile, when 
to look at the judges or 
the audience. My body 
feels like a machine 
whose manual I haven’t 
bothered to read.
