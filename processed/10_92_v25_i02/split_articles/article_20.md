In 1962, the 
TO team created a 
set of rules for Tang • 
in 
reaction 
to 
Silliman's sloppy 
performance the 
year before. The 
captains agreed on 
penalties for minor 
and gross spills, 
leaving beer in the 
glass, and false 
starts. "We're tired 
of seeing them toss 
beer 
over their 
shoulders," 
said 
captain Pete Gale 
(TO '62). "What 
we're interested in 
is a test of skill and 
a gentlemen's game, 
and this year we've -......-.

and some teams 
meet four or five 
times during the 
last week, no holds 
barred. "In Morse, 
12 
guys 
go 
through a keg in 
an hour," said 
team 
captain 
Shaw. 
"Usually 
guys throw up two 
or three times in 
that many hours. 
We're famous for 
what we call the 
'booting window' 
in the basement 
room that we use 
that way." 

Today the same rules apply, with a 
few refinements: a standard measur~ 
for the amount of beer left undrunk 
(the bottle cap) and a five-second 
penalty for cheating. Complaints 
about fairness and foul play still 
abound. According to DKE brothers, 
Tang judges make some of the tough-
est umpire calls outside of professional 
sports and must be well-seasoned to 
stay on top of the job. "We train a 
couple of young brothers each year, so 
there are always people with experi-
ence at the table," said Holland. 

Tang organizers chalk up most of 
the accusations about unfair calls to 
the special mixture of victory-driven 
and beer-befuddled competitors that 
the event produces. "When people 
have been drinking all day and practic-
ing all year, they're going to be frus-
trated and mad if they lose," Holland 
said.

Some Tang teams tap their first keg 
in the initial weeks of the school year. In 
most colleges, practice sessions often turn 
into parties. Regulars see Tang as the 
excuse that students need to let go. "It's 
hard for Yale students just to be social 
sometimes," said O'Neal. "Tang practice 
is an organized framework, so people fed 
better about spending time on it." 

Many Tangers point to the social 
benefits of hanging out with fellow ream-
members-people they might not other-
wise have known. Frosh meet older stu-
dents and different parts of the college 
community come together, all in the 
name of Tang. "The best thing about 
Tang was that I met a group of senior 
women who I wouldn't have had a way 


to practice in." 

Tang captains claim that team 
members who drink themselves into 
oblivion do so of their own free will. 
"If there's peer pressure, it's because 
you feel you're part of something and 
everyone's there and you want to do 
your best," said Stockmayer. At some 
practices, members who dorrt w'ant to 
drink chug water instead of beer. And 
a high level of alcohol consumption 
doesn't 
promise 
victory. 
The 
Davenport women, last year's winners, 
practiced with water and didn't start 
meeting until the last two weeks of 
classes. 

At practice, veterans coach bud-
ding young talent in the technique of 
the open throat that is key to speed 
drinking. "Chugging beer is really a 
mental thing," said Holland. "You 
have to force your body to do some-
thing it's not supposed to." 

To conquer the gag reflex, individ-
uals lean on the support of the group. 
"Tang is more than drinking, it's deep 
bonding," said Shaw. "It's important 
to get together a bunch of guys who 
care. " 

Rumors fly about teams who 
bond by mixing their beer with each 
other's bodily fluids. Even if such tales 
are exaggerated, most competitors 
make Tang practice a priority. "People 
must be taking Tang pretty seriously," 
said Darren Grow OE '93), "if all year 
they're saying 'No, I can't do my 
homework tonight, I have to get shit-
faced."' 

More and more students crowd into the 
yard to watch the final rounds. The frat 
house and port-a-potties can't absorb the 
rush for toilets, and when the urge hits, 
some stutknts stumble into the comer of 
the yard. Their work done, they zip their 
flies or wipe their mouths and go back 
for another beer. A cop car slows down as 
it approaches the house, and then drives 
on. 

The Yale and New Haven police 
handle Tang like other frat events: 
with caution. Yet they have never bro-
ken up Tang by enforcing underage 
drinking laws. DKE brothers say that 
for the last few years they have 
received threats from the police about 
Tang weekend. But most of the ten-
sion arises over keg suck, which takes 
place at a secret location at the intra-
mural playing fields each year, rather 
than Tang. The DKE house seems to 
lie outside the boundaries of police 
action. "I think the police mostly play 
it by ear," said Bustillo. "They keep an 
eye on us, but they tend to assume that 
Yale students are responsible drinkers. 
I think it's true of drinking in general 
here that there's a lot of trust on the 
part of the police." 

To DKE brothers, the lack of 
interference on the part of Yale's 
administration and police is welcome, 
if puzzling. Although Tang takes place 
off-campus, the university could still 
step in because the participants are 
students. Yale's willingness to turn a 
blind eye especially surprises DKE 
brothers because they feel that their 
fraternity gets a bad rap from the uni-
versity. "Let's put it this way: If Dean 
Trachtenberg wanted to rush, she 
wouldn't choose DKE," said Grow. "I 
don't know why she doesn't do any-
thing about Tang." 

Yale's administratotS hope every 
year to hear Tang's death knell. "That 
a frat has seen fit to take it over signals 
to me that it's a tradition whose time 
has come and gone," said Dean 
Trachtenberg. "Most students care 
about more important ways to express 
themselves." 

To Trachtenberg, the participa-
tion of women in the down and dirty 
frenzy only adds to Tang's utter lack of 
charm. "For women to feel that they 
have to prove themselves by taking 
part in that kind of traditionally male 
macho behavior is a violation and 
denial of the inherent strengths that 
women have," she said. 

Some students try to play down 
the competition's seamier side. "You 
can see Tang as a meat market that 
glorifies drinking, but it's also other 
things," said Davenport's Groeber. 
"We're doing something silly, but we're 
also competing for our college." 

Although Tang is not for everyone, its 
fans always show up, either to show off 
or to watch the show. Despite the 
social changes of the last four decades, 
the beer continues to flow, leaving 
naked, screaming, and most of all 
drunken students in its wake. 

At the day's end, a ftw stragglers sit 
propped against the DKE house, too sick 
to Leave. Their faces and clothes are 
streaked with mud. The goat comes wer 
to sniff them, and then wanders off to 
check out the more appealing mud in the 
comer of the yard.
