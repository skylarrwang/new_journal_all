T
wo months after high school graduation, Ben 
Murray (DC '95) was about to embark on the next 
major stage of his life. Not one to prolong good-
byes, he assured his parents that they had nothing to fear and 
walked out the door. He marched to the end of his driveway 
and turned left. 

Any similarities between Murray and other Yale-bound 
students ended there. Instead of heading for Yale, Murray 
continued walking until he had covered almost 15 mile.s, 
and he did the same thing every day for the next two weeks. 
All told, Murray wandered along the east coast for six 
months, going as far south as the Everglades and travelling 
by train, foot, ferry, bus, canoe, and thumbed rides. Along 
the way he supported himself with whatever work he could 
find, including a job making pizzas and a three-week stint at 
a Kentucky Fried Chicken in Daytona Beach. He befriend-
ed a 36-year-old ex-con and his pregnant wife, a hippie 
botanist, and a woman who let Murray stay with her and 
her family if he promised not to kill her. 

Though Murray rarely knew his itinerary for more than 
a day in advance, the trip itself resulted from months of 
planning. Since the beginning of his junior year, Murray 
had been contemplating an alternative to the standard high 
school-college progression. "I wanted to see stuff that I 
hadn't seen, and I wanted to do it on my own," he said. "I 
wanted to be self-sufficient on the bare minimum level. The 
trip was a confirmation of myself."

From the earliest stages of arranging his year off, 
Murray encountered opposition to his idea. Yet he remained 
determined. When his parents' apprehension crescendoed 
into a threat not to pay his tuition if he meandered for a 
year, Murray retorted, "Then maybe I'm taking the year off 
and not going to college afterward." He was even willing to 
forego Yale's offer if the university did not approve of his 
plans. 

Murray had no reason for concern: Â¥ale has never 
refused a deferment request. Indeed, the university looks 
quite favorably on the option, known as "postponed matric-
ulation" in admissions lingo. "I thin~t's a great idea, and I 
wish many more students would do it," said Yale Director 
of Admissions Margie Dahl. "The extra year of maturity 
and life experience makes kids that much more ready to 
tackle college." 

Students generally fill their year off with work, travel, 
or study, and they push these categories to new limits in the 
quest for "life experience." One student interned with a 
renowned puppeteer in Italy. Another worked in a hotel to 
raise money for college. Others have danced with the New 
York City Ballet. Many have participated in exchange pro-
grams or taken courses at other colleges. An interest in biol-
ogy led one Yalie-to-be to the top of the Andes, where she 
studied indigenous birds. 

A typical crop of deferring students also includes at 
least one person involved in a significant dramatic role. 
Because she could not back out of her current contract this 
season, Sara Gilbert postponed Yale's offer last spring and 
continues to play Darlene Conner, the younger daughter on 
ABC's "Roseanne." A promising career, however, has not 
altered Gilbert's plans to study psychology at Yale starting 
next year. 

Whatever the interim activity, postponed matriculation 
now enjoys the approval of many major American universi-
ties. At a conference Dahl attended, the dean of admissions 
of a prominent university suggested that Ivy League schools 
require all future students to defer a year. Postponement 
advocates cite potential benefits &om a year off, but one perk 
consistently tops their lists: postponement's ability to rekin-
dle waning academic motivation. For this reason Dr. 
Lorraine Siggins, chief psychiatrist for Undergraduate 
Health Services at Yale, staunchly supports deferment. "A&er 
12 years of school, it's often very useful for someone to have 
experience doing something else for a year, to see themselves 
as a fuller person," she said. "If they take a year off, it's free-
ing to them. They feel they need to get off the treadmill." 

Amanda McKenna (BK '95) realized that she needed 
such an academic respite only after she graduated from high 
school. "I was very tired of studying," she said, "and I just
