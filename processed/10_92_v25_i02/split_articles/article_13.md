But Fisher remembers the interview differently. "Streets 
took a less clear stand on the issues than any of the other 
candidates," she said. "He was asked about the abortion 
issue and simply did not answer." 


Students repeatedly questioned Streets about his stance 
on homosexuality. The chaplain condemned homophobia 
and said that he would be extremely unsympathetic to any 
religious group that wanted to exclude a person from its 
membership on the basis of sexual preference. "I am glad to 
be part of a congregation that is open and affirming of peo-
ple with different sexual orientations,., he said. Many evan-
gelicals believe that Streets' tolerance of homosexuality 
directly contradicts the Bible. 


As a result of his stance toward the authority of 
Scripture, Streets' most formidable challenge may be recon-
ciling the position of university chaplain with his role as 
pastor of the United Church of Christ's Batte!! congrega-
tion. As chaplain, Streets has pledged to promote and cele-
brate 
diversity. 
Yet 
evangelicals 
argue 
that 
a 
Congregationalist pastor must advocate a particular set of 
religious beliefs. According to Reginald Roberts (TC '94), a 
member of the Black Church at Yale, Streets has so fur failed 
to explain his plan to negotiate the tensions between his two 
responsibilities. The university itself recognizes that they are 
separate and perhaps even contradictory; on Oct. 4 it broke 
with tradition and installed Streets into the two roles at sep-
arate ceremonies. 


Streets contends that his emphasis on tolerance will 
facilitate rather than hinder the reconciliation of his duties. 
"As chaplain, I am informed by my faith community, but 
my role is not to make the university-nor its students and 
faculty-
Congregationalists," he said. ''I'm there to help 
people to address the questions of faith in their lives." 


Former chaplain Adams defends Streets' position. "There is 
a great difference between affirming one's own tradition and 
denying other people's traditions," he said. Adams added 
that a chaplain who aggressively sought converts would not 
be appropriate in a university serting. 


Evangelicals label such assertions as rationalization. 
"There is a feeling of disillusionment among students with 
this mealy-mouthed approach to the chaplain's position," 
said Fisher. "If you're going to have a chaplain that is worthy 
of the name, he ought to be first and foremost committed 
to his religion. There is an earnest desire among students to 
have a chaplain who believes in something." 


The schism between Streets and the evangelical com-
munity at Yale places the chaplain in an unusual position. 
While he may be in line with the mainstream views of his 
constituency-the university as a whole--he stands at odds 
with a large proportion of those who will take the most 
OcToBER 16, 1991 
active interest in his tenure as chaplain. Streets seems ready 
to grapple with this quandary. "I will be called a heathen or 
a converted person by some in the Christian community," 
he said. "One might even say I am being hypocritical. I 
don't think so. I think I am being faithful to my under-
standing of the Gospel." 


T
he chaplain will fuce less opposition in his efforts to 
draw Yale and New Haven closer together. Streets 
bridges both worlds. While completing his studies 
at the Divinity School, he served a term on the New Haven 
Board of Aldermen. In addition, he has been the pastor of 
an inner city congregation in Bridgeport for the past 16 
years. "Over time, he has built up a network of relationships 
in the city which will be a tremendous resource to the uni-
versity," Adams said. 


Within the university, Streets will preside over ceremo-
nial functions, such as memorial services, Association of 
Yale Alumni meetings, and Fresh person Assemblies. He will 
coordinate the umbrella organization for all of Yale's 
denominational groups and will act as a counselor to mem-
bers of the university community. In addition, Streets will 
continue Adams' policy of mediating disputes between the 
university and its labor force. 


Streets' background amply qualifies him for these vari-
ous roles. He holds a master's degree in social work from 
Yeshiva University and, as pastor of Bridgeport's Mount 
Aery Baptist Church, helped establish programs to provide 
affordable housing, health care, education, and daycare to 
city residents. He also founded the first church-based AIDS 
outreach program in Fairfield County. "We were looking 
for a person who could be a moral leader within the univer-
sity and at the same time be a human being people would 
really respect," Associate Dean Hackman said. "Jerry Streets 
fulfills these expectations, and does so with great humility." 


Streets' ability to focus on a variety of activities at once 
is perhaps the greatest asset he brings to the multi-faceted 
position of university chaplain. His capacity to keep a finger 
in every pie will be severely tested in the coming years, as he 
attempts to act as a spiritual leader within the university, 
while guiding Yale into a closer relatio nship with New 
Haven. H owever, the new chaplain will likely face his 
toughest challenge from campus evangelicals. The approach 
Streets rakes to the dash between tolerance and scriptural 
authority will redefine the chaplain's role in a university that 
in recent years has come to embrace faiths beyond the 
Christian fold.
