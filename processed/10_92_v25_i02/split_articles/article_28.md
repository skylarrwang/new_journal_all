**Yugoslavia: A Disaster of Western Policy**
**Author: Ivo Banac**
**Page number(s): 31-32**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
atic violation of Albanian national and 
human rights in Kosovo, where the 
Albanians constitute the absolute 
majority, are the most egregious exam-
ples of an apartheid state policy under 
European conditions. Not only has 
Albanian language and instruction 
been almost entirely eliminated from 
the public realm, but Albanians have 
been banned from virtually all profes-
sions. 

The essence of the Yugoslav politi-
cal problem was from the outset con-
nected with the illegitimate aspirations 
of Serbia. The political and intellectual 
leadership of Serbia took all of former 
Yugoslavia on a course that started with 
mythologized and falsified history and 
ended in bloodshed and genocide. 

This is something that ought to be 
pondered by those who are tempted to 
seek blame in abstract nationalism. 
There is plenty of nationalism in 
Russia, for example, and not a few for-
mer Communists with nationalise lean:. 
ings in power-yet Yeltsin is not a 
Milosevic. The Milosevic phenomenon 
is not a product of predetermined 
forces. It is a result of special circum-· 
stances and individual ambitions and 
obsessions. The cure will therefore 
have to be nuanced, but at the very 
least must include a repudiation not 
just of Milosevic, but of Serbia's expan-
sionist political program that dates 
from the 1840s, with or without the 
guise ofYugoslavism. 

Western policy toward Yugoslavia 
and former Yugoslavia, and especially 
the policy of the Bush Administration, 
has generally been a disaster. Instead of 
upholding political principles, by force 
if need be, Bush has settled for unrealis-
tic rhetoric and the appeasement of 
Milosevic. Appeasement has taken the 
form of entirely unrealistic alternatives 
to Milosevic: first the federal govern-
ment of Ante Markovic, then nothing 
from June 1991 to the beginning of 
1992, then the itinerant Prince 
Alexander Karadjordjevic, and now the 
returnee premier Milan Panic. Panic is 
a phrasemaker premier for Milosevic-
sponsored Dobrica Cosic, the president 
of Milosevic-created SRJ. Panic has no 
power. Cosic's power depends on 
Milosevic. 

As a friend put it, 
"Metaphorically speaking, in Belgrade 
we have a Stalin (Milosevic), a 
Chernenko (Cosic), and a Yeltsin 
(Panic). Only a Gorbachev is missing 
to tell them that the game is over." 

It would be an additional grave 
mistake for the U.S. to "play with 
Panic" to the detriment of real security 
arrangements that would prevent the 
escalation of war in the Balkans. The 
key strategic question: Can fascist 
regimes collapse without a powerful 
mass movement based on a real ideo-
logical alternative or without an outside 
military threat? Milosevic can be 
replaced by a Badoglio, but a Badoglio 
became possible only two weeks after 
the invasion of Sicily. The Serbian 
opposition is currently concentrating 
on weakening the determination of the 
West to maintain the sanctions. They 
argue, rather like Dusan Reljic in Vreme 
on Sept. 21, that the "West unaccount-
ably exaggerated with its disciplining of 
Serbia, using only the stick without any 
carrot for Panic." 

If they are incapable of toppling 
Milosevic, the oppositionists would do 
better to concentrate on fighting 
against his ideology rather than against 
the little that the West has done to stop 
him. Otherwise, the current whirlwind 
of activities around Panic will simply 
postpone the final reckoning. In the 
meanwhile, since Milosevic will cer-
tainly not give up without a fight, the 
chances of escalation are mounting. 
We shall soon know by how much.

To us, it's as easy as going 
to the faucet. To millions 
of children in the develop-
ing world, it's a lifesaver. 
Over 3.5 million children 
die each year of diseases 
resulting from unclean 
water, but the Peace Corps 
is doing something about 
it. Volunteers are at work 
on 5 continents, educating 
developing communities 
about health and nutrition, 
building wells and sanita-
tion systems, and helping 
to eradicate water-borne 
diseases that unnecessarily 
cause the deaths of millions. 
Your degree or experi-
ence in nutrition, nursing, 
other allied health fields, 
or even construction can 
be put to use in Asia, 
Africa, the Pacific Islands, 
and Latin America. Join 
those who are person-by-
person bettering the health 
of the world. And coming 
back with an edge on the 
competition for graduate 
school or a boost up the 
career ladder. Lend a 
hand. Share your heart.
