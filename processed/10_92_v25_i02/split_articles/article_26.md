to grasp this logic. "When people say, 
'It's going to set you back a year,' I miss 
where it's setting you back from," she 
said. "They say you're a year farther 
away from being a doctor or a lawyer. I 
would hope that life doesn't begin when 
you become a doctor or lawyer." 
While some postponed matricu-
lants do experience an initial disen-
chantment with college, the phe-
nomenon usually dissjpates quickly. 
Jane Murphy (BK '95) toyed with the 
idea of deferring again during the first 
week of her freshman year after having 
spent nine months in Turkey, where the 
widespread poverty made a lasting 
impression on her. "It seemed very easy 
to get caught up with just work and 
classes, and I was upset with myself and 
what I was doing," she said. Though 
the fe.eling still lingers, Murphy has 
realized that she can make a differ~nce 
in New Haven while studying at Yale. 
As it did for Murphy, time off 
from the conventional paths of sec-
ondary and higher education can dra-
matically recast the way students view 
their lives. "There are certainly a 
number of people I know here who 
would enjoy their lives now more and 
enjoy college more if they had taken 
some time off;" the well-traveled 
Wishcamper said. While on the road, 
he had to fend for himself--economi-
cally and otherwise--for the first time, 
which significantly eased the move to 
college the following year. The novelty 
of taking classes after a year off and 
the painless transition convinced 
Wishcamper that he had done the right 
thing, and that others could benefit as 
well. "When you go to a private high 
school and then you're planning to go 
to an Ivy League school, there's a lot 
you miss," he said. By taking a year off, 
students like Wishcamper get a taste of 
the world before they enter the ivory 
tower.
