Is there any such thing as Yugoslavia? The terminology 
itself is confusing. Four of Yugoslavia's republics have 
declared independence. They are, in ch·ronological order, 
Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, and Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
Three of these (Croatia, Slovenia, and Bosnia-Hercegovina) 
have received recognition by most governments, including 
the U.S., and are members of the United Nations. The 
remaining two (Serbia and Montenegro) call themselves the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SRJ}, claim linear descent 
from Marshal Tito's Socialist Federative Republic of 
Yugoslavia (SFRJ), but recognize none of the SFRJ's institu-
tions, including the autonomy of Serbia's two autonomous 
provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo, and have unilaterally 
promulgated a new constitution. 
The status of the SRJ is unclear. Its claim to be the 
exclusive successor to the moribund SFRJ is based on the 
notion that the other republics 
"seceded" from Yugoslavia, but this 
is disputed by the other successor 
states who claim that Serbia 
destroyed the Yugoslav federation 
and cannot now expect the benefits 
of former federal property and mem-
bership in international organiza-
tions. To Croatia and Bosnia-
Hercegovina, Yugoslavia is the inte-
gral and irretrievable sum of its for-
mer parts, not just any redefined 
portion of its former territory. To 
the United Nations, it is a rogue 
country that had to be expelled from 
this year's membership in the 
General Assembly, presumably to 
reapply at a later date as a new state 
(or states), but not as the equivalent ofTito's Yugoslavia, one 
of the United Nations' founding members. 
Then there is the question of the "war in Yugoslavia." 
War is certainly raging in Bosnia-Hercegovina and is still 
simmering in Croatia, but not a smgle shot was ever fired in 
the country that still calls itself Yugoslavia. Is it simply our 
inability to catch up with the new political realities, or does 
something in Western political culture rebel against the frag-
mentation of states, even when (or perhaps especially when) 
the fragmented states are federal conglomerates? 
The bloodshed started in June 1991 when the Yugoslav 
People's Army ONA), with the connivance of the federal 
0crOB£Jli6, 1991 
government of Ante Markovic, initiated an attack against 
Slovenia, which had just proclaimed independence. Croatia, 
which asserted its independence at the same time, was 
sidestepped in the attack and avoided resisting the army on 
behalf of its friendly and allied Slovenian neighbor. Croatia 
was already under attack, since its internal Serb insurgency, 
which was to a significant extent organized by Serbia's securi-
ty agencies, was armed and backed by the federal army. 
After the army's half-hearted showing in Slovenia, which 
the Slovenes resisted with all of their limited might, the JNA 
agreed to the withdrawal from Slovenia. The federal army 
had already become an agency of Serbian expansionism. 
With no Yugoslavia in sight and no Communist vision pos-
sible, the men of Tito's army transferred their loyalties to 
their national communities. In most cases that meant that 
their loyalties were transferred to Serbia and its policy of 
carving out a Serbian state from 
parts of Croatia and Bosnia-
Hercegovina. 
The professionalism of the 
army was no longer evident. In 
Varazdin the CroatS l:>ought peace 
with cash. Elsewhere, the army 
took on various "reservists" and 
"volunteers," who then proceeded 
to establish their reputation for 
murder and pillage throughout 
the inner rim of Croatia, from 
Vukovar to Dubrovnik. These 
vicious "militias" spearheaded the 
expulsion of Croats from the Serb-
occupied areas of Croatia. They 
continued this practice, now com-
monly called "ethnic cleansing," 
against Muslims and Croats in Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
What is the ideological basis of "ethnic cleansing"? The 
collapse of communism has engendered lethal and mutant 
forms of ideology. For example, until 1990 Serbia's strong-
man Slobodan Milosevic was the president of the League of 
Communists of Serbia, Serbia's branch of Yugoslavia's 
Communist party. Then he had his party renamed the 
Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS). The controlled Belgrade 
press celebrated the event by setting Milosevic's portrait 
alongside those of Fran9ois Mitterand, Willy Brandt, Neil 
Kinnock, Bettino Craxi, and Felipe Gonzalez. 
The Western press kept saying that Milosevic was acru-
