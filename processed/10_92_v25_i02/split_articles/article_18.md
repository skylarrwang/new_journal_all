en Anne Graham was dying of cancer, she didn't 
want to burden her family and friends with the 
onstant care that she required. Her doctor told 
her about Connecticut Hospice, a program that provides ser-
vices for the terminally ill. Graham thought the idea verged 
on the morbid. "Some people are just attracted to tragedy," 
she said. But when she called a volunteer, she found that the 
woman had once been ill herself and had hated being depen-
dent on others. The woman brought Graham medications 
and did errands, freeing Graham's family to spend more time 
with her. 

Over the years, thousands of people have turned to 
Connecticut Hospice. Founded in 1974, the non-profit orga-
nization specializes in anticipating and treating the needs of 
the terminally ill. While its focus appears unconventional to 
some, Hospice staff and volunteers believe that dying people 
and their families have unique needs that merit special care. 

Community leaders, hospital administrators, and 
physicians throughout the state praise Connecticut 
Hospice for not only providing superior medical care, but 
also for coordinating the services of physicians, nurses, 
volunteers, and agencies such as AIDS Project Mew Haven 
and the State Welfare Department. The organization pro-
vides home care to over 1 ,000 patients each year, regard-
less of their ability to pay, and operates a 52-bed hospital 
in Branford. Connecticut Hospice, ranked among the top 
five percent of health care providers in the United States, 
has become a leader in the movement to personalize 
health care, matching advanced medical techniques with 
individual attention. "Hospitals would be well-advised to 
study the pain control methods used by Hospice," said Dr. 
Robert H. Gifford, Associat~ Dean at the Yale School of 
Medicine.

symptom manage-
ment and the alle-
viation of pain. 
Patients who have 
more 
than 
six 
months to live, or 
who want to seek 
curative treatment, 
are not eligible for 
the program. "I 
understand why 
Hospice has to 
limit their ser-
vices," said Dr. 
Margaret 
Drickamer, 
Associate Chief of 
Staff for Geriatrics 
and Extended Care 
at the West Haven 
Veteran's 
Administrat ion 
Hospital. "If they 
tried to do all sorts 
of other care as 
well, they would use 
up their resources 
on ten patients."

said Peter Kuritt, Director of 
Pastoral Care. After careful 
screening by Hospice, volun-
teers enter a seven-week ori-
entation program in which 
they learn about bathing, 
feeding, and dental hygiene 
in order to assist the home-
care nurses. "I've done every-
thing from taking people on 
walks to making soup," said 
volunteer William Farrell, 
New Haven's retired chief of 
police. 

Patients turn to Hospice when they have exhausted possi-
bilities for a cure. "A lot of times the patient tells you that they 
don't want any more high-power invasive procedures," said 
Dr. Fitzhugh Pannill, assistant professor at the Yale School of 
Medicine. Hospitals, concerned with fighting disease, often 
make pain management and family input lower priorities. 
Hospice tries to offer an alternative tailored to the desires of 
the patient. 

Palliative care, however, has met with criticism from med-
ical professionals, who feel that Hospice over-prescribes nar-
cotics. Hospice workers argue that if a patient is at the last 
stage of a disease, fear of addiction has less relevance. The 
organization's pharmacists specialize in preparing medications 
to maintain a high level of alertness in the patient. "Our goal 
is to improve life in the short term," said Dr. Fred Flatow, a 
Hospice physician. Hospice has received hundreds of letters 
from grateful families, who say that the expert alleviation of 
pain gave them important moments with their ill relatives. 

H
ospice patients stay at home with their families, while 
doctors, nurses, social workers, and volunteers help 
the household to anticipate the needs of the patient. 
"Every week there's something new that's lost, like her being 
able to hold a coffee cup by herself," said the husband of one 
Hospice patient. "It makes you wonder what's going to hap-
pen next." After a patient dies, Hospice stays in contact with 
his or her family for at least a year. "The emotional support 
that the families receive is enormously effective for the sur-
vivors," said Rosemary Johnson-Hunder, CEO and President 
of Connecticut Hospice. "They can get back to life and pick 
up the pieces." 

Connecticut Hospice relies heavily upon 400 trained vol-
unteers, 50 of whom work in the greater New Haven area. 
Although the program offers spiritual support through a net-
work of clergy, Connecticut Hospice has no religious affilia-
tion. "Proselytizers are gently dissuaded from volunteering,"

Hospice has also created 
a network of artists and writers who encourage self-expression 
and creativity in patients. A metalsmith helped a die cutter 
craft two swan pendants for his daughters. Yale writing 
instructor Donald Faulkner, a former Hospice staff member, 
engaged patients with srories and poems. "I have come to rec-
ognize the value of the story that each individual has to tell, 
and of the deep value of memory as a cohesive process that 
lends. itself to the transcendence of pain," he wrote in 
C"ativity and th~ Clcs~ of Life, a Hospice publication. 

Hospice concerns itself with the needs of the individual, 
rather than the disease to resist a 'professionalization' of death. 
"In a situation like Hospice's, where staff interactions are so 
tightly-knit and family input is actively sought, patients receive 
better care," said Lynn Hallarman, a student at the Yale School 
of Medicine who spent a rotation at the in-patient facility in 
Branford. The hospital assigns each nurse to only three patients 
so that he or she can provide emotional support as well as med-
ical care. "You have to be ready to do this kind of nursing," said 
Kathy Miller, Head Nurse at the in-patient facility. "However, 
the nurses here really support each other. The high ratio of 
nurses to patients makes the work very satisfying." 

Through its network of support services, Hospice offers a 
unique, inclusive approach to health care. Dr. Gifford believes 
that families have popularized the program because it fills a gap 
within health care and community service. "Hospice wouldn't 
exist," he said, "if families didn't want it." 

Patients claim that Hospice helps them to maintain their 
dignity. "Before they come, most people consider the Hospice 
facility as a waiting room for death. I know I did," said a cur-
rent patient. "That is not its primary function. Hospice has 
made me stronger, taken away my pain, and helped me make 
my own decisions."
