Hillary Clinton strode to the microphone ac a 
recent rally on the New Haven Green, prominent 
ocal Democrats flanked her on every side. Smiling, 
waving, and looking for all che world like an 
Osmond family snapshot, che politicos attempt-
ed co conceal the factionalism that divides their 
party and the city it dominates. But only the 
Secret Servicemen were fooled. To jaded resi-

Biagio DiLieto took City Hall back for the 
machine. Despite such shifts, the office has 
remained firmly in Democratic hands ever since 
1953. 

Younger city voters tend to shudder at the

he then calls it an organization," said Arthur Barbieri, who
