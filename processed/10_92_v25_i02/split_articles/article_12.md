After Harry Adams retired from his post as Yale's university chaplain last year, a special search committee sought 
to fill his shoes with a bridge builder-someone who could 
serve as a liaison between Yale and New Haven. They chose 
Rev. Frederick J. Streets (DIV '75), a pastor at an inner-city 
congregation in Bridgeport and a committed urban advocate. Streets, the first black and the first Baptist to serve as 
university chaplain, brings with him a reputation for tolerance and a commitment to the community. But his 
appointment has alienated some of Yale's most religiously 
active students. 

The controversy surrounding the new chaplain centers 
on his refusal to reject non-Christian religious beliefs. "I 
have come to understand that there is more than one way to 
God," Streets said. "The way that I have found is through 
Jesus Christ, but I would not insist to someone else that this 
is the only way." 

As university chaplain, Streets hopes to help students 
explore various paths to spiritual truth. One of his goals, he 
says, is to foster an atmosphere at Yale in which spiritual 
questions receive attention as legitimate and worthwhile 
areas of inquiry. But he emphasizes the process of inquiry 
itself, rather than the validation of any particular belief system. "I would be honored if a student were to say it was 
because of my involvement that he opened up to becoming 
a Buddhist," Streets said. 

Streets' relativistic position has alarmed members of 
Yale's evangelical community. "Most of the people I've spoken to tell me they are disappointed with him," said Sean 
Robertson (MC '94), a member of the Campus Crusade for 
Christ. According to Marena Fisher (GRD '92), a member 
of the Yale Standard Bible study group, evangelism insists 
upon the absolute and ultimate authority of Christian scriptural texts. "Streets' position is an outrage for anyone who 
has really committed himself to Christ," Fisher said. 

In light of Streets' stance toward non-Christian faiths, 
evangelical students feel that the university chaplain is 
not a true Christian. "The idea that one can say, 'Jesus 
might be Lord, but I might be wrong,' is to say that one has 
not met with the Lord," Fisher said. "Streets is either fudging his position, or he is not a believer. He is talking out of 
both sides of his mouth. If he is a Christian, he has 
betrayed his Lord with that kind of a position." 

The breadth of the theological gulf between Streets and 
Yale's evangelical students first surfaced during the chaplain 
selection process. During meetings between the university 
community and prospective candidates, students asked 
Streets to address a wide range of issues, including the 
morality of abortion and homosexuality. Associate Dean 
Judith Hackman, who co-chaired the chaplain search committee with religious studies professor Wayne Meeks, said 
that students were extremely rigorous in their questioning. 
During the meeting, Streets emphasized the good that 
can come from people with different viewpoints disagreeing 
in a spirit of "Christian love." "That's extremely important 
in an ecumenical community," said Rebecca Parkhill (DIV 
'93), who participated in the discussion. "The big point he 
tried to make was that he wanted to have an open line of 
dialogue. He's a really good listener."
