th its dilapidated buildings and closed store-
fronts, New Haven begs for the Midas touch. 
Developer Joel Schiavone (BR '58) thinks he's 
the man for the job, but no one seems to be listening. "I've 
been working 15 years on my vision of New Haven," said 
Schiavone. "I have spent $10 million on neighborhood revi-
talization and never made one penny back." In the past, 
Schiavone could afford to run his business on a vision. 
Now, as the city reels from the recession, his vision is crum-
bling before his eyes. Schiavone blames the city for his woes. 
Meanwhile, his critics wonder whether he wants to help the 
people of New Haven or just himself. 

When Schiavone talks about improving New Haven, 
he talks about neighborhoods. "New Haven is the only 
walkable, pedestrian-sized city in the state of Connecticut," 
he said. "The city needs low-scale restoration. That means 
neighborhood restoration." The Chapel Street district, 
which Schiavone renovated, embodies his hopes for New 
Haven. On a short walk through the slick and safe urban 
neighborhood, New Haveners can shop, go to a show at the 
Palace or Shubert theaters, and have a bite to eat at any of a 
dozen restaurants. 

Schiavone became a New Haven neighborhood icon as 
'24 THE NEW jOURNAL 
he built his high-profile business empire. His career began 
at the Harvard Business School with a pizza chain called 
Your Father's Moustache, branched out into such ventures 
as Connecticut Limousine and Grey Line Tran~rtation of 
New York, and peaked during the 80s with the rise of 
Schiavone Realty and Development Corporation of New 
Haven (SRDC), which owns much of the property along 
Chapel Street. 

Schiavone combines business acumen with his own 
unique style. He has camped out on the roof of the 
Coliseum to promote the New Haven Nighthawks, played 
banjo in The Galvanized Jazz Band, posed nude for his Yale 
25th reunion book, and launched a campy gubernatorial 
campaign. At one event, he mounted a live elephant and 
proudly rode the Republican party mascot down Chapel, 
the street that symbolizes his 
success. "You need an ounce of 
flamboyance to move rev-
enues," he said, linking his 
shenanigans back to business. 

Lately, 
however, 
Schiavone's style has not 
brought him success. His real-
ty company faces serious finan-
cial difficulties, and Schiavone 
recently lost his New Haven 
landmark, 
the 
Taft 
Apartments, to Mutual of New 
York. The bank completed the 
foreclosure in September, 
three months after Schiavone's 
$7.5 million mortgage pay-
ment came due. At least one 
former tenant has accused him 
of bad business practices, and 
Schiavon~ has drawn Local 74's ir~ for mzploying non-union stag~ cr~s at his Palac~ Th~att!r. Schiavone is also waging war 
against a local union. 

Schiavone claims that his business difficulties result from 
the expiration of tax programs that helped his company 
mushroom during the 80s. For years, Schiavone relied on 
phase-ins, the incremental tax payment plan that helped busi-
nesses get off the ground by allowing them to pay gradually 
higher tax rates over a five year period. The city has recendy 
discontinued the program for Schiavone's properties. 

Schiavone's critics claim that although he blames the
