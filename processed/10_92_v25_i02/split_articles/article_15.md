For the first time in United States history, two Yale University alumni face each other in a battle for the presidency. The election is not only a contest of Republican versus Democrat, but also of Old versus New Blue. While incumbent George Bush (DC '47) will try to break the curse of single-term Yale alum presidencies, Governor Bill Clinton (LAW '73) hopes to introduce a completely new concept to the Oval Office: a Democratic President from Yale. The outcome of the contest will either preserve or destroy the small and exclusive club of presidential Yalies with traditionalist Republican leanings, short terms in office, and monosyllabic names like Taft, Bush, and Ford. 


Weighing a portly 225 pounds, William Howard "Big Bill" Taft graduated in 1878. At that time, Yale offered only required courses like Latin and Euclidian geometry. "A few ancient things were studied intensively under tutors," wrote historian George Pierson, "while many modern things were examined briefly and rather superficially under the professors." 

Yale permeated Taft's life. He had a family well-stocked with alumni, and after his own graduation he went on to serve as a Yale Corporation member and Kent Professor of Law. Whatever his country might have thought of him, Taft could take comfort in the fact that Yale and its alums considered him the university's finest product. "He was immensely popular with his own class and by the time he was a senior, he was the best known and most admired man at Yale," wrote historian David H. Burton. "To know him was to believe in him." Members of Taft's class even argued about who first gave him political backing. 

Taft was more an amiable Bonesman and man-about-campus than an intense intellectual. Although he earned salutatorian honors upon graduation, the future president viewed his school exercises as obstacles to overcome. "Taft stood high," wrote classmate Herbert W Bowen, "but that was because he was a plodder-not because he was bright." 

In all his pursuits, Taft felt pressure from his overbearing father, who filled his son's college days with the anxiety of inadequacy. "You expect great things of me," Taft once wrote to his father. "You mustn't be disappointed if I don't come up to your expectations." At times his frustration exploded into violence. One evening two classmates visited Taft, who asked them to leave him alone to study. When they refused to go, he became dangerously angry and flung books and other objects at the fleeing men. Nevertheless, Taft's diligence inspired classmates, who admired the moral example he set by avoiding liquor, tobacco, and most rowdy social events. 

Upon graduation, Taft entered the Cincinnati bar, obediently following the path prescribed by his father. His prominent family and Ivy League background ensured a steady progression of political appointments. In a few years he rose from assistant prosecuting attorney in Cincinnati to become the first American Governor General of the Philippines. His energy and zeal caught the eye of President Theodore Roosevelt, who designated Taft as his preferred successor. 

But Taft never wanted the presidency. His was a judicial rather than a political temperament. As in his coursework, Taft viewed each political appointment as another obstacle to the Supreme Court. "I would much prefer to go on the Supreme Bench for life than to run for the presidency," he lamented. "In 20 years of judicial service I could make myself more useful to the country than as president." 

Although Taft eventually reached his goal, he first blundered through a frustrating term in the Oval Office. "Taft had the ill fortune to be a conservative at a time when the country was consumed by progressivism," said history professor emeritus John Morton Blum. "He was not a mediocre man, merely a mediocre president." Taft's privileged upbringing did not prepare him to tinker with the status quo or accept reforms. Comfortable with a hands-off presidential role, he shied away from the strong executive style of his predecessor Roosevelt. Congress rather than Taft initiated the notable legislation of his Presidential term. 

George "Poppy" Bush came to Yale from patrician Old Blue roots similar to Taft's. Yale counted Bush's great-grandfather, father, and several other relatives among its graduates. The future president deviated only slightly from his family's scholastic path. Instead of heading directly to Yale from Andover, Bush enlisted in the Navy in 1942. When he finally reached Yale after the war, Bush found its sport jacket and grey-flannel conservatism to his liking. He attended a university that had evolved remarkably little since the days of "Big Bill" Taft. 

But a few things had changed. Five thousand servicemen entered the university in 1945-the largest class in Yale history. Bush participated in a special program for ex-Gis, completing his course of study in two and a half years. Like the rest of the former soldiers, he was obsessed with doing well, getting ahead, and making up for lost time. Bush concentrated less on intellectual inquiry than on the codified "vision-free Yale experience." 

"Poppy," with his Skull and Bones and varsity baseball credentials, exuded the same charismatic confidence as Taft. "He was one of those fellows who was sort of a golden boy. Everything he did, he did well," noted classmate Senator John Chafee (R-RI). "I guess my first impression of him was that he was in the inner set, one of the movers and shakers." But in his classes at Yale, Bush never demonstrated unusual initiative. 

"Bush took the curriculum that was there," Smith commented. "There was no quest for an overriding sense of purpose." In contrast to other Presidential alumni, however, Bush appeared to have set his sights on the Oval Office. 

Gerald Ford (LAW '41) had to beg his way into Yale. A star football player at the University of Michigan, the future
