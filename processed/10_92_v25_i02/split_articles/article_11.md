EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Culture shock, you hope, means stumbling off the 
plane in Paris on a freezing January night and letting the 
reality of all those movie images overwhelm 
you. In an instant, you find what lures the thousands of 
backpackers who sleep on train station floors each summer. 
Culture shock means falling in love with strangers in the 
Metro and never letting the trivial bother you, because in 
Paris even trivialities feel profound. 

In May, after four months in Paris, I was still 
waiting for culture shock. The last 
weeks of the 
semester rolled 
by and the city 
still eluded me. 
Prague's buildings, the giant angels on the roof of the Musee 
d'Orsay in Paris. But I worried (mostly in the company of 
other Americans) that I had not learned to stop seeing 
things academ1cally, that I couldn't stop reducing all but the 
most overwhelming encounters to a cool discourse on 
Culture. After a day of museums in Rome, I wrote: "Do I 
spend all my energy packing 
these things into a series of 
stereotyped cubbyholes in 
my memory?" 

When May came and 
my Eurail pass expired, I 
wanted a summer job. 
"You'll never find a job," 
said my host family's 
maid, a 
Moroccan 
woman 
who 
has 
cooked for them and 
cleaned their plush 
apartment for the last 
25 years. "Are you 
crazy? What can you 
do, 
anyway?" 
I 
winced. In spite of 
my 
triumphant 
independence, I 
felt 
useless. 
could argue with 
train conductors, find free 
toilets, and scrape by academically, serious 
about nothing except my frustrated gropings for the "real" 
Paris. But I wanted to do something: As it turned out, I 
could have herded goats in the Pyrenees, but before I got 
that offer I had accepted another from Evelyne, the ruth-
lessly cheerful matriarch of a bed and breakfast and dairy 
farm in Courtomer, Normandy, a town with fewer people 
than it has cows. 

Courtomer presented the kind of culture shock you 
might expect from joining the circus. To make ends meet, 
Evelyne had just added evening meal service to the bed and 
breakfast. Her lively two-year-old, the 40 cows, and her 
hopeless disorganization made exploiting a foreigner like 
me the only way to get through the day. I discovered within 
a couple of days that Evelyne had wildly misrepresented 
what she expected of me. In exchange for room, board, and 
$20 a week, I scrubbed toilets, pumped gas in the rain, and 
played "Happy Birthday" on the violin for guests. After a 
12-hour workday, I scrambled to help serve dinner to 14 
people, while the eight members of the household juggled 
their own meals in the kitchen. Marcel, the nutty old gar-
dener, was supposed to finish the dry bread, as Evelyne's 
husband and mother-in-law dutifully ate the leftovers of 
two-year-old Marie. Marie ate whatever she felt like, her 
sheer stage presence and sense of humor dissolving any 
attempt at order. The teenaged sons and hired help fought 
over the ketchup, teased each other, and conspired against 
Evelyne, who came back into the kitchen to stomp ruthless-
ly over the rebels and turn down the music. 

"Why do you put yourself through these things?" said a 
friend who visited me in July. "This place is hell." I thought 
of the few hours I had to myself as heaven, but when I came 
back down into the big kitchen, I felt more awake and 
engaged with the world than I have since the excitement of 
freshman year at Yale. Everyday life as a contact sport in a 
circus ring left me no time to wait around for culture shock 
the way I had in Paris. Neither did life in Courtomer leave 
time to develop "cultural understanding," that erudite state 
too many people confuse with looking for more accurate 
stereotypes. More than anything else, life with Evelyne 
demanded attention, usually in eight directions at once. 

The day her 15-year-old son chased 23 escaped cows across 
his grandmother's pasture, I tried wildly to appreciate the 
humor and French-ness of the crisis, but I had to chase cows 
too (I lost a shoe at the critical moment, and the cows 
plunged into the corn patch). Looking at postcard figures in 
Paris and running after cows in Courtomer felt as different 
from each other as listening to music and playing it. 

But six months in Europe don't undo three years at 
Yale. After months of trying to experience France on 
its own terms, I stopped fighting my own mental 
mannerisms. I would not have survived the first grueling 
month in Courtomer without Middlnmarch to retreat into, 
and Evelyne's tyranny would have driven me crazy if I 
hadn't been able to stash her away in a long series of imagi-
nary five-page papers. Chaos made the experience, but my 
own efforts to give the chaos an intellectual structure kept 
me from drowning in it. 

When Evelyne left me in charge of Marie at a family 
reunion, I tried to keep her from running all over the room 
and finally surrendered. I recorded: "I'm completely encircled 
by dancing French people in a long line holding each 
other's shoulders. Accordion music makes the whole thing 
feel like a cross between Faust and Our Town, some can 
keep a beat and some can't, smiles and hands reach down to 
us, I am sitting on the floor with Marie ... " Evelyne would 
find it hilarious that I couldn't simply remember this event, 
but also had to label it as the perfect metaphor for the 
whole summer. Whatever else Yale does to your mind, it 
teaches you to try to make sense of circuses. And a university 
education also gives you enough of a taste of what's out 
there that you can and will stumble around the world until, 
through persistence or just luck, you find it-whether you 
call it circus or culture.
