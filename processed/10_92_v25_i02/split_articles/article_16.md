"I really don't have any particular agenda in mind," Siggins said. 

"Obviously we want to get started as soon as possible, but there are issues of organization and training and people getting to know one another." 

Dean Trachtenberg wants the new group to shift from an exclusive focus on peer counseling to include educational outreach, moving more of the task of providing care to UHS. The dean hopes that student ideas will further shape the new group. "I want to open this committee up to the community," she said. 

Yet the Dean's office has put out little publicity about a steering committee for the new peer counseling group, and students remain skeptical about the administration's attempts to replace Response. "I think the committee is a step in the right direction," said Schneider. "But I am a little wary that setting up the committee is just another way of avoiding the real issue--which is that rape is becoming a bigger problem on campus." 

For students, the current confusion raises questions about Yale's commitment. "I think that generally Yale doesn't see sexual assault as a serious problem," said former Response counselor Kim. 

Yale's existing services do not seem to inspire student confidence. Last year, no undergraduate pursued a case before the Sexual Assault Grievance Board. And Mental Hygiene is a common target of student complaints. To supplement Mental Hygiene care, students express hope that the peer counseling aspect of Response will be resurrected. "While UHS is equipped to deal with sexual assault, one of the purposes of peer counseling is that you're talking to a peer, not a professional," Kim said. "That can be very therapeutic." 

But with ties between RCS and Yale severed, Kelly will no longer permit students to train at RCS and counsel at Yale. She instead envisions a relationship with Yale like the one RCS has with other area campuses, where it trains resident advisers, speaks in classes and dormitories, and meets with administrators. "We will come to Yale," she said, "if Yale wants us." 

Students also suggest new directions for the educational efforts of the future group. "I'd like to see a lot more outreach to men," said Alexander. Wesleyan has tried men's outreach through a pamphlet entitled ''Aquaintance Rape: The Facts. Not for Women Only," written by a former undergraduate. Currently, Yale provides no such literature to its students. 

But the present lack of action on issues of sexual assault at Yale may soon end. While many students criticize the Administration's past record, they also recognize the new group as a positive development. "I think it's too bad there's a gap right now," said one former Response counselor. "But I can see Trachtenberg's group being successful, certainly in terms of providing education to the campus." 

Student opinions hinge on the question of when and how the new collaboration between students, administration, and UHS will take shape. If university officials want student counselors to channel survivors to Mental Hygiene, UHS must ensure that it can provide competent and timely care. 

While most students support the administration's concept for future services, they wonder how it will operate in practice, and fear the void that exists in the meantime. "I am really confident that Dean Trachtenberg is sincere in doing what's best for the students," said fresh person counselor Alexander. "But it will take a long time for Yale to do a responsible job--and I don't know if Yale can afford that time."
