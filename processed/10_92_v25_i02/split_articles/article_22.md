things like that. There has to be some

ment money. But today, the scarcity of 
city dollars has crippled the machine's 
power to deliver. In fact, younger New 
Haven Democrats argue that Barbieri's 
beloved "organization" is only a mem-
ory. "The reality is that there is no 
machine," said Alderman Michael 
Morand (D-1). "Today, New Haven 
politics are based on individual candi-
dates. Barbieri is a symbol of what has 
been, and while that's important to a 
lot of people, it's also the past." 

Without an omnipotent party to 
steer the city's course, the checks and 
balances of New Haven's "system" have 
hampered political action in recent 
years. Despite its small size, New 
Haven is broken up into 30 wards, 
each represented by an elected alder-
man. Together, these representatives 
form the Board of Aldermen: a legisla-
tive body that has veto power over the 
mayor's budget, the allocation of fed-
eral grants, and some appointments to 
various departments of the city. However, the mayor 
does not need an aldermanic seal of 
approval for his choices of police com-
missioner and members of the influen-
tial boards of finance and education. 

The competing interests of alder-
men, boards, the mayor, and other 
groups often stymie the decision-mak-
ing process. "If I had my choice, I'd

probably reduce the size of the Board 
of Alders from 30 to 18," said 
Morand. "While it's important that 
parochial interests not be sacrificed, 
the system often leads to gridlock." 

Parochial battles not only occur 
between parties, but within them as 
well. 
"The 
Democratic 
Town 
Committee meetings drag on because 
there are a lot of factions," said com-
mittee member Janna Wagner (JE 
'95). "Everyone wants to speak, which 
is good, but we never resolve the ques-
tions we first addressed." 

Old members of the Democratic 
Party acknowledge that they can no 
longer keep disagreements private and 
internal. 
For 
instance, 
Chairman Barbieri endorsed John 
Daniels' primary opponent John 
DeStefano in the 1989 mayoral con-
test, and other older party members 
deserted Daniels when he stood for 
reelection in 1991. 

Nothing has arisen to take the 
place of the old Democratic monolith. 
"Mayor Daniels is a product of the old 
machine," said Paul Bass OE '82), edi-
tor of the New Haven Advocate. "But 
when he ran against it in 1989, he 
never really built an organization of his 
own." Bass cites the growth of "mini-
machines" as the wave of the future. 
"Wendell Harp is really the power 
behind the scenes in the black com-
munity," he said. "He has his own 
kind of machine and people depend 
on him, while Arthur Barbieri is still 
the head of the remnants of the old 
Italian machine." 

Despite the existence of such fac-
tions within the party, drawing clear 
lines based on race, ethnicity, or class 
had become impossible in New Haven 
politics. The Advocate recently ran an 
article claiming that local businessman 
Harp, angered at the independence of 
ex-crony and State Senator Chuck 
Allen (D-1 0), pushed his wife Toni 
Harp to announce her candidacy for 
Allen's office. Regardless of what actu-
ally inspired Harp to throw her hat 
into the ring, she split the African-
American vote and carried off the 
party's endorsement. 

Factionalism divides the party 
rank and file as well as insiders. 
Indeed, the city's Democratic party has 
suffered from the same defections that 
have cost its national counterpart the 
past three presidential elections. 
"There are a good chunk of 
Democrats in this city who are what 
you'd call 'conservative' Democrats," 
said Andy Siegel (TC '93), chairman 
of the Democratic Coordinated 
Campaign at Yale. "They have no 
qualms 
about 
opposing 
local 
Democratic candidates. For instance, 
there are five Republicans on the 
Board o£ Alders now, which is a sub-
stantial increase from four years ago." 

The Elm City's GOP minority has 
taken advantage of the rise in conser-
vatism. "Th~ Republicans have a great 
deal of support on the East Shore, and

lot more Republican," said Bass. 
"There are a lot of working-class white 
people there who feel the Democratic 
party is too black now." 

Republican leaders see the swing 
to the right as a ballot-box rebellion 
against the overarching control of the 
Democratic party rather than as a 
racial issue. "People don't want to reg-
ister Republican because they know 
that the Democrats rule everything. 
It's not smart to declare yourself their 
enemy," said Republican Town

Committee 
Chairman 
Ralph 
Marcarelli. "But obviously a lot of 
people are not loyal Democrats. If you 
count all the Republicans and unaffili-
ated voters in New Haven, that num-
ber would still not account for the 44 
percent of the vote we won in the 
1991 mayoral election." 

Indeed, Alderman Jonathan 
Einhorn's (R-25) close loss to Daniels 
in the 1991 race inspired more hope 
than disappointment. Bass and others 
believe that Republican leaders are try-
ing to convince former State Senator 
John Esposito to run for mayor in 
1993. His popularity and high name 
recognition may give his party a good 
chance of recapturing the mayor's 
office for the first time in 40 years. 

A 
in 1991, Yale's tax-exempt 
tatus might again become one 
f the most heated issues of the 
next mayoral race. As the city's larges-t 
landowner and second-largest employ-
er, Yale is a key player in the city's 
political game. Almost all of Yale's-. 
properties are tax-exempt, angering, 
local leaders strapped for cash. But 
Yale's substantial political influence 
has enabled the university to control 
much of the debate surrounding the 
taxability of its property. "The univer-
sity has used its clout both locally and 
nationally to prevent a serious exami-
nation of whether it has the responsi-
bility to pay taxes or not," said Bass. 
"One of the reasons that New Haven 
is so poor is that Yale has all of this 
non-taxable property." 

More than a few local politicians 
in both parties hope to pull the rug 
out from under Yale tax-free status. In 
the late 1980s, New Haven-based state 
representatives Paulicia Dillon (D-92) 
and Martin Looney (D-96) intro-
duced a bill that would have removed 
many of Yale's tax privileges from the 
State constitution. ·But Daniels 
opposed the bill and helped persuade 
the legislature to kill it. He then struck 
OcrosER 16, 1992. 
his own deal with Yale. In exchange for 
allowing the university to buy the 
rights-of-way on parts of High and 
Wall Streets, Yale agreed to pay taxes 
on its golf course and to ante up for 
city-provided fire services. A fiery rati-
fication battle ensued at the Board of 
Aldermen, and while Daniels won, the 
Yale agreement became a major elec-
tion issue in 1991. 

Although the "tax Yale" issue and 
the battle between Harp and Allen 
indicate the extent of disagreement 
within the Democratic Party of New 
Haven, the group appears somewhat 
more united when supporting officials 
on the national level. Indeed, the abili-
ty 
of 
candidates 
like 
U.S. 
Representative Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) 
to unite the city's various groups is 
nothing short of amazing. "She's man-
aged to stay above the party warfare 
within the city," said Morand. "At the 
same time, many people feel that she 
should do more to bring the local 
party together." 

For the time being, factions with-
in New Haven's ruling Democratic 
party have set aside their own petty 
interests for the sake of candidates like 
DeLauro and presidential hopeful Bill 
Clinton (LAW '73). Still, the post-
election period promises a return to 
divisive politics as usual. 

But to the chagrin of the city's 
Republicans, the fractured Democrats 
still manage to maintain their electoral 
advantage in New Haven. "The genius 
of the Democratic Party here in New 
Haven is that, despite the factions, 
they ultimately come together by 
always keeping their eye on the ball, 
which is power and money," said 
Marcarelli. "They're not what you'd 
call a principled party. But I'm certain 
that if the Republicans had controlled 
the city and its money for 40 years, 
we'd have turned out the same." ..,.
