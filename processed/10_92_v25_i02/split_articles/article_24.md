city's tax policies for his financial misfortunes, his own mis-
management is the true culprit. He has often referred to his 
real estate business as a hobby. When Schiavone ran for gov-
ernor of Connecticut in 1990, SRDC t9ok the back seat to 
his unsuccessful political campaign. He spent $1.1 million . 
of his own money to pay for gimmicks like the circus parade 
on Chapel Street. Still, Schiavone defends his political aspi-
rations as a means to bring change to the city he says he 
loves. 

But some say that Schiavone's actions do not back up 
his professed devotion to New Haven. Although he lives in 
the Taft Apartments, works on Chapel Street, and often eats 
lunch at Spanky's, a local diner, some think his behavior 
masks less friendly intentions. Speaking from personal expe-
rience, they assert that Schiavone cares more about profits 
than people. Both Shalom Lemel, owner of Taft Cosmetics, 
and Ed Mangini, President of Union Local 74, view the 
development tycoon's business practices as anything but 
neighborly. 

L
emel relocated his store from the corner of College 
and Chapel Streets to Whitney Avenue as a result of a 
fallout with Schiavone. Th_e Gap, a nationwide 
clothing chain, has taken over the space that the drug store 
occupied for decades. Lemel finds the new tenant a strange 
choice for someone who touts the importance of neighbor-
hoods. "My store was a social spot where everyone could go 
to get their pharmacy goods or just get a Coke," he said. 
Lemel believes that Schiavone wanted him out and raised 
the rent so that he could not afford to stay. 
Schiavone ,disputes the charge, claiming that he wanted 
Lemel to renew his lease, but could not afford to settle for 
the low rent Lemel asked. Lemel refused to pay any more 
than $12 a foot, which Schiavone says is below the going 
rate for that property. "That guy," said Schiavone, "is the 
biggest pain in the ass I've ever dealt with." 
Lemel is not the only sore spot in Schiavone's life these 
days. For several weeks, Local 7 4 has picketed his Palace 
Theater since Schiavone locked them out when union nego-
tiations broke down in late September. The Local 7 4 stage 
crew is now out of work because Schiavone has hired cheap-
er, non-union labor from Poughkeepsie, New York. 
Mangini, president of Local 74, questions why a commited 
neighborhood advocate would deprive New Haveners of 
jobs. "If this is the city he loves, has invested in, and taken 
to heart, then what he seems to be doing is taking the peo-
ple of New Haven, slapping them across the face and saying 
'to hell with you, I gotta get what I gotta get,'" Mangini 
OcrosER 16, 1992 
said. "He thinks he should own New Haven. He's a man 
who would be king." 

In defense of his decision to lock out Local 74, 
Schiavone asserts that the Palace Theatre cannot afford 
union labor. He said that the negotiating process has been 
going on for over 15 years with little progress. Schiavone 
attributed the lack of headway to the union's refusal to 
lower its rates and to Mangini's huffy behavior. "The guy is 
acting like a 1930s labor boss," he said. Schiavone added 
that he would hire non-union New Haveners if he could 
have found a qualified non-union stage crew in the area, but 
since none existed, he had to go elsewhere. 

A
lthough he sits atop a crumbling empire, Schiavone 
finds time to rail against the city. The proposed 
Taubmen shopping mall, ~ pet project of Mayor 
John Daniels, particularly incenses him. Schiavone believes 
that the interest alone on the city money needed to build 
the mall would pay for him to restore the area from Wooster 
Square all the way up to St. Raphaels Hospital. "New 
Haven needs revitalization through lower taxes for city 
neighborhoods," he said, "not revenues from tax increases 
which are funneled into city projects." 

The Daniels administration has a different vision for 
city development. The mall, a longtime Daniels dream, will 
cover 20 acres, spanning Route 34 on a transfer platform 
and incorporating land south of the highway. City officials 
estimate that it will generate approximately $5 million a 
year for government coffers and create 4,000 jobs. Tony 
Bialecki, Economic Development Officer for the City of 
New Haven, argues that without the mall, New Haven faces 
fiscal doom. The city's already-faltering downtown retail 
district will soon have to compete with the new Ha~Y!den 
Court mall. The mall will draw customers from New Haven 
and surrounding cities and could put Chapel Square MaJl 
and swank upper Chapel Street out of business. 

Because New Haven must raise taxes to pay for the new 
mall, Schiavone thinks the city's plan will ultimately destroy 
his development business. With his Chapel Street properties 
already in trouble, he cannot afford to take many more loss-
es. But despite his economic woes and the harsh words of 
his detractors, he still boasts about his accomplishments on 
Chapel Street. "Now it looks like I will lose my $10 mil-
lion," Schiavone said. "But the work I've done here, I 
think, will last a long time."
