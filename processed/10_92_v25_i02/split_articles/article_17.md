presidenr dreamed of going on to law 
school. Yet his lack of funds forced 
him to rake a coaching job at Yale 
College rather than enrolling in the 
university. Yale's deans, who did not 
want to burden Ford with the dual 
responsibilities of coaching and study-
ing, refused to allow him to enter law 
school. After several 
seasons of coach-
ing, Ford con-
vinced them 
to relent. In a 
class that 
included 
Potter Stewart, 
Byron Whi re, 
Sargent Shriver, 
andCyrus 
Vance, Ford per-
forma:! solidly. 
The future president's resilient 
determination to get through law 
school characterized his future politi-
cal 
career. 
He won 
his 
first 
Congressional race with resourceful 
perseverance, campaigning from one 
farm in Michigan co the next. Once in 
Congress, Ford progressed chrougiJ 
che leadership ranks as easily as Taft 
and Bush had climbed the govern-
ment ladder. 

Still, Ford seldom demonstrated 
much imagination. "Although I 
believe that Ford is underestimated, I 
also think chat he was just an able guy 
who didn't want to gee beyond a cer-
tain level," said Yale Law School Dean 
Guido Calabresi. "He was just com-
fortable not being out on a limb too 
much." 

Professor Smith agreed. "Ford was 
che center on the football team, not 
the quarterback," he said. "The center 
helps carry che line through. Ford 
could work with people of a broad 
range of views to generate consensus, 
bur he was noc the executive leader 
type." No one, especially Ford him-
self, ever considered him presidential 
material. 

Unlike Bush and Taft, Ford was a 
OcroeeR 16, 199:1. 
self-made man who originally had no 
elite family connections to ensure his 
success. Yec no matter what road these 
three men took co prominence, they 
all rode into the Oval Office on the 
coattails of predecessors who were 
impressed by their steady and work-
manlike dependability. Taft, a loyal 
'trouble-shooter under Roosevelt, 
attracted that presidenr's eye and later 
his endorsement. George Bush wooed 
moderates to the Reagan ticket while 
tailoring his policical views to those of 
his running mate. And Ford joined 
Nixon to shore up his floundering 
administration at a time when 
Watergate threatened the president's 
future. 

Political science professor Sceve 
Skowroneck suggests that the same 
men who brought these Yale alums to 
power doomed them. Roosevelt, dis-
gusted by Taft's inertia, ran against 
him on the Bull Moose ticket in 1912. 
Ronald Reagan's fatherly persona and 
immense popularity boosted Bush 
into office, but the vice-president 
never attracted a similar following. 
And tainted memories of Nixon 
haunted Ford from the time he par-
doned the ex-leader until Jimmy 
Carter defeated him in 1976. 

No matter what the result, Nov. 3 
promises to change che history ofYale 
presidencies. If George Bush wins the 
election, he will become the first ever 
Yale president to capture a second 
term in office. And if Bill Clinton suc-
ceeds in his bid for the presidency, he 
will be the first alumnus of the post-
1960 "New Blue" university to occu-
py the Oval Office. Wichouc the shad-
ow of a strong president to hang over 
him, Yale's first Democratic president 
could break with several of the less 
illustrious precedents set by Taft, 
Bush, and Ford.
