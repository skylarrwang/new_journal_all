When Tang drinkers kneel at the table in the backyard 
of the Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE) fraternity, they become 
part of a Yale tradition that refuses to die. Yale's campus 
today bears little resemblance to the all-male bastion of old-
time prep schoolers who created the drinking competition. 
But to the delight of some of today's (supposedly) more 
sophisticated students, Tang sloshes on. 
According to myth, Air Force soldiers in T imothy 
Dwight and Silliman Colleges began the drinking duel in 
1940. The first record ofTang dates from 1951, when 10 
men from the TO "Prexies" and the Silliman "'Manders" 
downed 40 glasses of beer in two rounds and attracted over-
flow crowds to the back of one of their college courtyards 
during Derby Day, then Yale's annual end-of-the-year 
extravaganza. The competition has since developed a 
detailed set of rules, expanded to include all the residential 
colleges, survived a university ban by moving from Cross 
Campus to DKE, and adjusted to coeducation by including 
women in 1988. 
What began as a lark turned first into a popular event 
on Cross Campus and then into Yale's biggest frat party, fea-
turing die-hard competition and live entertainment. 
Scheduled for the first Saturday of reading period, Tang 
absorbs the wave of spring fever that hits the campus as 
classes end. DKE claims that between 20 and 25 percent of 
Yale undergraduates show up during the day to drink about 
85 kegs of Milwaukee's best. 
The crowds also come to cut loose. "People here are so 
uptight and wound up, they forget how to have fun," said 
Gretchen O'Neal OE '94). "If drinking is the only way to 
break down those barriers, then maybe we should do it 
more often."

In the 70s, Tang's popularity led the university's Social 
Activities Committee (SAC) to sponsor pre-race practices. 
The competition expanded to include t~ams from all the 
residential colleges and moved to Yale's most spacious and 
central location: Cross Campus. In those glory days, Tang 
featured live bands, 100 kegs of free beer from the Miller 
Brewing Company, and the tacit support of the administra-
tion. 

But in 1983, the Connecticut legislature raised the

drinking age from 19 to 20, and President A. Bartlett 
Giamatti pressed the Council of Masters to cut the tap. 
When the council prohibited the use of SAC funds and 
banned the race ftom the Yale campus, Tang's future seemed 
doomed. 

DKE, then Yale's only fraternity, stepped into the 
breach. Tang moved off-campus to the frat house, where it . 
has remained in residence ever since. Team members chip in 
$10 each to cover the cost of practice beer, but DKE pays 
for the parry and runs the show. "It's a lot of work, but we

the evem lase year. DKE has made Tang the centerpiece of 
Wooly Goat Weekend, which also includes keg suck, an 
endless round of pre and aft:er parties, and, of course, a live 
goat.

In 1988, DKE nodded to equal opportunity and added

a women's competition. "We started women's Tang to be

the P.C. DKE that everyone knows and loves," said Jim 
Gretchen Stockmayer (SM '93). "I know that there's no

way, with laws and image the way they are, chat the univer-
sity could allow it to happen on Cross Campus. But it 
would be nicer. We wouldn't have to kneel in sloppy beer 
mud." 

Today's administrators have no plans to lift the ban 
imposed by Giamatti. Indeed, the very thought of the evem 
makes them bristle. "I think chat Tang is disgusting," said 
Betty Trachtenberg, Yale's Dean of Studem Affairs.

But some male Tangers chink chat the women are fool-
{ ing themselves. "Women's Tang started to make things 
equal, and because there were some good women drinkers, 
but it's not the same serious tradition," said Adam Shaw 
(MC '93). He believes chat most men watch the women 
for the spectacle, not their drinking prowess. "Guys are 
more of the audience, and they won't remember which 
women's team won. People are imo women's Tang more for 
the entertainment chan the competition."

Tang teams have always looked for clever ways to strut 
their scuff. Once in the days of old, TO entered on the 
shoulders of toga-dad freshmen, while "slave girls" fed them 
grapes and trumpets heralded the entrance of the caravan. 
Not co be outdone, Silliman sec up an outhouse over a man-
hole in their college courtyard. Team members dressed in 
black tie climbed up from the manhole and exited one by 
one from che outhouse onto the field as an emcee 
announced their names over a loudspeaker. 

In the '80s, some men's and women's teams started to 
use body paint, team uniforms, and 
strip teases to add to their allure. 


When watching the race becomes 
tedious, the crowd can ogle the team 
with the craziest style. "I guess the 
actual competition isn't that interest-
ing," said Raoul Bustillo QE '93). 

All the hoopla has an added bene-
fit: in the women's competition, what 
you don't wear can help your score. 
"Sometimes the judges start the watch-
es later because a team wears risque 
outfits or is good-looking," said one 
female Tanger, who declined to be 
identified. "The whole reason we took 
off our shirts was that we thought we'd 
get points for it," said another woman. 
"The DKE brothers were telling us 
that the more clothes we took off, the 
better we'd do." 

Hollarid dismisses the accusation 
that judges favor women in bras. "A 
judge would never tell someone to 
· take their clothes off," he said. "That's 
just some DKE brother joking who 
people took too seriously." 

Not everyone buys DKE reassur-
ances. "With the women, of course the 
hotter team might have the edge." said 
Shaw. "What do you expect? They're 
frat boys." 

For some women, the attitude of 
some judges and spectators comes as 
an unexpected blow. "Regardless of 
how good our team felt going into it, 
when we got there we were hit with 
th is attitude of men gawking at 
women, and it's not right," said 
O'Neal. "It's almost like the team with 
the biggest set has the advantage." 

In the playoffi, the bleary-eyed competi-
tors hoist themselves onto the stage with 
difficulty. Two drinkers fail to finish 
their glasses to the last drop, and two 
more spill beer Mwn their chins. A judge 
who wears a wet suit comes over to make 
a penalty call When he adds the one and 
two second penalties onto the drinking 
times, the judge declares the team that 
apparently finished last the winner. A 
shouting match follows, full pitchers fly,
