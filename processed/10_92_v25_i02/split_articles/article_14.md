**Title: The Struggle to Respond**

L
ast July members of Response, Yale's rape crisis hoc-
line, received a disturbing letter from their parent 
organization, Rape Crisis Services (RCS) of the 
Greater New Haven YWCA. Since 1986, state-trained stu-
dent rape crisis counselors have staffed a nightly hotline at 
Yale. But RCS director Marianne Kelly abruptly informed 
them that as of September, Response would shut its doors. 


The closing of Response has thrown the future of rape 
crisis peer counseling at Yale into doubt. Without RCS on 
board, Yale administrators may try to shift students from an 
independent hodine to university-sponsored outreach · 
efforts. And the process of reassigning Response's role has 
pushed administrators, former counselors, and students to 
examine the services that Yale provides for both prevention 
and treatment of sexual assault. 


Without Response, students who want crisis counseling 
must turn to the general RCS hotline. Student counselors 
hope to set up hours three times a week when callers can 
request a Yale counselor, but no such schedule currently 
exists. And no organization has yet taken over the sexual 
assault educational outreach that Response provided. 


"Certainly something's wrong," said Danna Schneider (BR 
'93), a member of Women Breaking the Silence, a group 
formed last year in reaction to an alleged campus date rape. 
"We need services and we need them fast." 


RCS Director Kelly gave several reasons for her decision 
to close Response. Because the organization received an 
average of only two to four calls every month, with most 
callers asking for information rather than crisis counseling, 
Kelly questioned the need for the hotline. Even for crisis 
callers, Kelly dismissed the idea that peer counselors could 
help where others could not. "When you're in crisis, all cat-
egories slip away," she said. "You don't care if you're speak-
ing with a Yale student or not." 


Kelly also expressed concern that student counselors 
worked too independently of RCS. "I felt my own ability to 
supervise the Yale counselors was unsatisfactory," she said. 
As a working mother, she often found it difficult to attend 
the evening meetings most convenient for student coordi-
nators. 


Kelly's memory of working as a student rape crisis 
counselor at the University of Connecticut in the 70s fueled 
her fear that without proper supervision, students could do

more harm than good. "I remember feeling totally over-
whelmed, like I'd been thrown to the wolves," she said. "It's 
a huge responsibility for a college person involved in a mil-
lion other things." 


Kelly's misgivings led her to worry about student dis-
cretion. Concerned that a slip-up could further traumatize 
survivors, as well as jeopardize RCS state certification, Kelly 
did not allow the Yale counselors to speak to anyone other 
than RCS supervisors about any facet of their cases. "You've 
got to be very careful," she said, "or you might make sur-

vivors think that they can't come to you or trust a coun-
selor's confidentiality." 


Bound by RCS's strict confidentiality policy, Response 
never issued public statements, either about individual cases 
of alleged sexual assault or about general patterns of behav-
ior. Response gave priority to providing help for individual 
survivors and their loved ones and spent less time on 
activism. The organization limited its outreach efforts to an 
annual Rape Awareness Week in April and periodic table-
tents. 


Response's refusal to divulge information brought it 
into conflict with the Yale administration. Because they had 
no authority over student counselors' decisions, Yale admin-
istrators viewed the group with apprehension. "Response 
got little support from Dean Trachtenberg," said Norman 
Kim (TD '93), a former Response member and current 
Walden counselor. 


While they valued counselors' commitment to keeping 
their cases secret, administrators objected to Response's 
insjstence on withholding basic facts. Despite adminstra-
tors' promises to protect survivors' identities, Response 
counselors refused to speak with Yale officials about their 
cases, and the administration claimed that the group's confi-
dentiality policy prevented the university from aiding sur-
vivors, either by providing counseling or taking legal action. 


"We can't act on hearsay," said Betty Trachtenberg, Yale's 
Dean of Student Affairs. "We need people to come forward. 
How can we be responsive if we don't jcnow what's going

he present dearth of sexual assault services on cam-
pus does not reflect Yale's past record. In 1986, Yale 
became one of the original members of the 
Connecticut Consortium for the Prevention of Sexual 
Assault on University Campuses, founded by former RCS 
director Barbara Moynihan. The Consortium, which RCS 
operated from its New Haven office, quickly expanded to 
include most colleges in Connecticut. Then-Associate Dean 
Patricia Pierce became one of the most active college repre-
sentatives in the Consortium, and spent about 20 percent of 
her time working on issues of sexual assault. 


However, because of budget cuts the university chose to 
eliminate Pierce's position as Dean of Academic Life. Dean 
Trachtenberg, whose job already included student affairs 
and freshman life, inherited Pierce's responsibilities. "It was 
really a big job to add on to Dean Trachtenberg's existing 
duties," said Pierce, now Dean of Student Affairs at the 
School of Management. 


At some universities, health service staff guide effons to 
address sexual assault as well as care for survivors. Wesleyan's 
health service employs a medical educator who creates pro-
OcToa£Jt 16, 1992 
grams for sexual assault prevention, substance abuse, and 
eating disorders. "One of my first efforts was to create a 
campus-wide coalition on sexual assault," said Carol Grant, 
Wesleyan's director of Health Education. Grant brought 
members of the faculty and administration into a campus 
coalition on sexual assault and helped form two student 
groups: one to hold informational talks at residence halls, 
and another to prepare resident advisors to deal with date 
rape. 


Yale's University Health Services (UHS) has no compa-
rable position. Joan Wexler, a social worker on the UHS 
staff, spoke with this year's freshperson counselors about

how to discuss sexual assault with first-year students. 


Several counselors expressed dissatisfaction with Wexler's 
talk, saying she gave the wrong legal definition of rape, 
neglected to mention basic procedures that survivors who 
want to prosecute must follow, and gave scant attention to 
date rape. "Overall, the freshperson counselor preparation 
was very good," said freshperson counselor Karen Alexander 
(BK '93). "But the sexual assault talk was the weakest part." 


RCS has also reduced its support of campus services. As 
director, Moynihan helped two Yale students found 
Response. "When I left RCS, things with Response were in 
place," she said. But when Kelly replaced Moynihan in 
1989, she lost the help of an RCS staff member who had 
previously stayed in touch with the campus. 


In hindsight, Yale officials question the wisdom of 
Response's past connection to RCS. "Many of Kelly's con-
cerns were always present," said Dean Pierce. "It may have 
been a mistake for students to affiliate themselves with an 
outside group." Because Response counselors answered only 
to supervisors at RCS, Yale officials remained outside the 
loop and lost the opportunity to work with students on sex-
ual assault prevention. 


Without an RCS liaison or specific staff member from 
UHS's Mental Hygiene department to spearhead the effort, 
Yale has not yet charted a course for the future of sexual 
assault services. "We're trying to figure out how concerns 
can be dealt with," Wexler said. "We have no conclusions 
yet." Dean Trachtenberg and Lorraine Siggins, chief psychi-
atrist at UHS, have called for the formation of a committee 
to establish a new peer counseling group, but have not yet 
defined the way in which they want the group to function.
