EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The bulldog may not have 
a mane or know how to roar, 
but he’s still the most lionized 
animal in the New Haven jungle. 

There are animals stronger in 
number—pigeons, 
seagulls, 
tiny brown birds that hop, and 
squirrels fat from acorns and 
pizza—but as far as notoriety 
goes, 
the 
bulldog 
is 
king. 

Celebrated with fanfare and 
immortalized 
in 
iconography, 
Handsome Dan graces T-shirts, 
shot glasses and mugs: a blue and 
white swirl of protruding cheeks. 

He frowns down from a bright 
yellow poster in the Berkeley 
College Dean’s Office and appears 
in black-and-white photographs 
at Yale’s Mead Visitor Center. 

In real life, there’s Sherman, 
a beautiful dog with a silky 
coat, a muscular, proud torso, 
and large, doleful eyes. Yale’s 
seventeenth 
Handsome 
Dan, 
Sherman came to Yale at eight 
weeks old from an English 
Bulldog breeder in Tennessee. 

He was aptly named after the 
tanks of the Second World War. 

Sherman’s owner and trainer, 
Chris 
Getman, 
has 
coached 
Sherman’s 
predecessors 
since 
1983. Sherman’s strict regimen, 
which consists mostly of walking, 
preserves his fine physique. In 
Getman’s words, he’s built like 
a “linebacker, not a lineman”—
powerful, but compact. Most 
bulldogs are fairly sedentary, but 
Sherman’s fitness is of the utmost 
importance. At charity auctions, 
people bid thousands of dollars 
for the opportunity to walk him. 

Recently, I had the privilege 
of visiting Sherman and his trainer 
at their home on Whitney Avenue. 

At one point Sherman came to 
my side, a rope toy in his wide 
mouth. I struggled to pull the 
toy from the grip of his powerful 
jaw. His muscles stretched taut 
as he tilted his oversized head 
and stared me down in silence 
from behind calm eyes. A dog like 
Sherman does not need to bark. 

The original Handsome Dan 
was purchased for $5 from a local 
blacksmith in 1889. Majestic even 
in death, his fine, taxidermized 
form still graces Payne Whitney 
Gymnasium’s 
Membership 
Services Office, where he is 
encased in his own glass cube 
next to a larger display of trophies. 

I recognize his face from the plush 
bulldogs lining the shelves at the 
Yale Bookstore. From behind the 
glass, he keeps watch, his ears


**Dog's Life**

When 
Dave 
Duda 
first 
opened the Book Trader Café 
and Bookstore twelve years ago, 
he stood behind the counter 
and announced, “This is it. I’m 
closing the book here. This is 
where I’m going to spend the 
rest of my life.” At the time, 
the store was one of four used 
bookstores in New Haven, each 
vying for Yale business. Today, 
it is the only one that remains.

My 
mother 
owns 
an 
independent bookstore and I’ve 
been browsing through books 
my whole life. And yet I am one 
of many students who resort 
to finding books online. With 
hyperlinks, pics, video clips, and, 
of course, cheaper prices, it is 
increasingly enticing to opt for 
accessible digital resources. But 
the sad truth is, as more and more 
people exchange the printed 
page for the electronic screen, 
more and more independent 
bookstores face financial decline.

But at 12:30 on a Friday, Book 
Trader is packed. A quick glance 
into the glass-paned, greenhouse-
like sitting area reveals no empty 
chairs. The line to the café counter 
at the back of the store is long, 
and the front door doesn’t stay 
shut for more than a minute. 

Through the brick archway to 
the left of the entrance, there is 
little room to navigate between 
the high shelves, as people stand 
flipping through an array of books 
about art, architecture, poetry, 
drama, philosophy, and religion. 

Duda’s career in used books 
began when he walked into a 
used bookstore on a job-hunt 
after college and was hired on 
the spot. At first, the job seemed 
like a waste of time, but in 
retrospect, Duda recognizes that 
it served as his apprenticeship: 
he developed the instincts for 
knowing what to buy and what 
to write on the price sticker. 

Of the thousands of used 
books that sellers offer him 
weekly, Duda has to pick and 
choose which ones he wants to 
buy. “Some people think if you’ve 
got a one hundred year old book 
it’s worth something,” he explains. 
“Most of the time it isn’t.” He 
calls this one of the most basic 
problems facing the printed page 
today. As more and more people 
want to sell their books and 
make a quick dollar, the market 
is flooded with used books, a 
phenomenon which drives down 
the price. Since his beginnings, 
Duda has seen the price of a used 
book fall from $10.95 to $4.95. “I 
wish anybody luck opening a new 
bookstore these days,” he says. 
“There’s so much more media 
competing with the printed page.”

Many 
independent 
bookstores, 
including 
my 
mother’s, have responded to this 
price decrease by supplementing 
their literary stock with toys, 
stationery 
goods, 
and 
other 
knick-knacks. The number of 
books in an average bookstore 
has slowly decreased, and those 
that remain are hidden from 
view by other products. The 
store survives financially, not as 
a bookstore—but as a toy store. 

At Book Trader, sandwiches, 
soups, coffee, and baked goods 
have, as of yet, kept the plush 
animals and artisan cards at bay. 

Duda acknowledges that the café 
portion of Book Trader provides 
much of the store’s revenue. 

When I tell friends that I’m writing 
about Book Trader, they’re more 
likely to bring up the Jane Rare, a 
delicious roast beef sandwich with 
horseradish mayo, or the amazing 
hot chocolate, than the books. 

The café’s success is what allows 
Duda to pay a little more for books 
and sell them for a little less. But 
the edible bounty takes nothing 
away from the literary stock. 

Unlike 
owners 
of 
independent bookstores, Duda 
remains committed to keeping 
it about the books: “We think 
we’ve created something kind of 
special that people appreciate. 

There’s a community of people 
that enjoy this establishment 
and what we’ve done. I don’t 
have too many desires about 
how to make it better.” The café 
brings in a lot of money, but the 
bookstore part of the business 
still draws in locals and out-of-
towners alike, whether they want 
to buy books or, more often, 
spend an afternoon browsing. 

Sadly, a time may come when 
Google Books and the Kindle 
become our primary media for 
reading literature. But there is 
a hope that other independent 
bookstores 
will 
learn 
to 
supplement their literary stock 
with whatever products allow 
them to stay financially afloat.
