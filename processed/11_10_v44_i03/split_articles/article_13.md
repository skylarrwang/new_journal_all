accomplish. We longed for the Ivy 
League ring—the mark of an athletic 
championship win amongst eight 
schools known for their academics. 
“Student-athletes that come here 
don’t make the decision to come to 
Yale lightly,” says teammate Miyuki 
Hino ‘12. “There are athletes that 
choose not to come to Yale because 
it’s too much academically, and they’d 
rather go somewhere they can coast 
through their four years while focusing 
on sports. It’s often overlooked, but it’s 
a rare breed that is willing to compete 
academically with non-athletes,” she 
explains. 


On YWS, we came to Yale 
with a drive for academics and thrive 
on soccer’s fast-paced competition. 
For this reason, Rudy says, “We train 
4-5 times a day like a professional team 
anywhere in the world. Obviously 
they have class everyday but people are 
working hard to achieve their goals. I 
am preparing kids to be productive. 
The Yale name can only take you so 
far if you are not productive.” 
Under the pressure of Division 
I competition, we learn to push 
ourselves 
through 
game-time, 
midterms and papers. We want to win 
against the other Ivies--Brown, Penn, 
Cornell, 
Columbia, 
Dartmouth, 
Harvard. Even Princeton matters. 
When the season moved to 
Ivy-League play, however, we were 
disappointed by loss after loss. On 
occasion we would pull a win, but 
things would never quite work when it 
mattered. Finishing fifth in the league 
did not reflect our hard work or our 
capabilities. Win or lose, we are very 
grateful for everything YWS has given 
us. “After playing for four years, I’ve 
learned that the important things are 
not having the most championships, 
but maintaining a constant love for 
the game surrounded by a family (the 
team),” explains Natalie Romine ‘11. 
Yale Women’s Soccer is about the 
team. For athletes and non-athletes 
alike, the best times in college are 
not those spent in lecture halls or 
the bent over textbooks—our social 
interactions are most important. 
Be it on the field, on the stage or in 
the newsroom, challenges bring us 
together.   On YWS, we bond over high 
competition in soccer and school. Says 
teammate Emma Mullo ‘12, “Playing 
three seasons, I am blessed to say that I 
got exactly what I was looking for—an 
extremely rigorous academic setting 
and immensely competitive athletic 
world. I could not ask for more out of 
my experience.  I love my YWS family 
here. I have learned more from being 
part of this team than anything I could 
have learned in books,” she shares. 
Senior day—for reasons perhaps 
more social than athletic—was the 
pinnacle of our season.  Senior Day 
is the last home game of the season—
it’s always marked by speeches and 
celebration for our oldest players. Our 
game was scheduled after the men’s 
game, but theirs went into overtime, 
and we had to wait. The women’s 
team sat in the locker room as Rudy 
gave the pre-game talk. Suddenly, 
Rudy said “I have a surprise for you 
guys.” We looked at each other and 
shuffled our cleats in anticipation. 
The lights dimmed and a projector lit 
up the white board. Rudy sat down in 
a chair at the front and pulled out a 
saxophone. He shifted his chair a little 
and drew deep breaths. “All right, I’m 
a little nervous,” he told us. “Whew.” 
He lifted his instrument to his lips 
and began to play “My Heart Will Go 
On.” A slideshow started. Pictures of 
the seniors faded in and out as Rudy’s 
music brought us to tears. 


When the slideshow finished, 
Rudy played Stevie Wonder’s “I Wish” 
with CD accompaniment, and we 
all danced.  It was like a live band 
was right there just for us— we just 
hopped, skipped, and boogied with 
not a care in the world. I sweat with 
these girls everyday—it felt good to 
let loose in celebration. We rode the 
high enthusiasm from the dance party 
into the game versus Columbia. We 
celebrated our first goal with a group 
dance on the field. The energy we’d 
had in the Penn game was back. We 
beat Columbia, 2-0. And it wasn’t the 
best part of the day.

efore I met David Koskoff 
’61 LAW ’64 and his wife 
Charlotte Koskoff, I sat 
behind them during an undergraduate 
performance of Tom Stoppard’s 
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead 
this October. Mr. Koskoff was the 
one leaning over and explaining a joke 
to his wife, loud enough that I could 
hear, too. I had seen the pair in many 
Yale audiences, but they were no one’s 
parents or professors that I knew. 
Curious, I found them after the play, 
and Mr. Koskoff confirmed proudly 
that he and his wife see between 
one and three undergraduate shows 
every weekend. Eager to share his 
thoughts on these shows, he invited 
me to dinner at their apartment 
on York Street in New Haven.
Though 
the 
Koskoffs’ 
interest is in Yale theater, I’ve never 
appeared on a Yale stage, so when 
I e-mailed, hoping to establish my 
credentials, I dropped the name of 
the play I was directing that opened 
in December. “We are definitely 
looking forward to your  show,” 
Mr. Koskoff wrote back cordially. 
“Though I don’t think we have 
prior familiarity with your work…”


T
he Koskoffs spend only weekends 
     at their York Street apartment, 
where they’ve lived since September 
2009. They spend the rest of the 
week in in Plainville, Conn., where 
Mr. Koskoff recently retired from 
his law firm. Also a writer, he has 
published three nonfiction books. 
One, Joseph P. Kennedy: A Life 
and Times (1974), made the front 
page of the New York Times Book 
Review. He still has the clip. He is 
currently at work on a biography 
An evening of scenes with scenes from the life of David Koskoff ’61 LAW ’64, Yale un-
dergraduate theater’s biggest fan.
When it comes to baseball, we’ve stepped up to the plate. At basketball,
we’ve got a slam-dunk. For football, we need no Hail Mary. 
Soccer, however, is a whole different ballgame.
