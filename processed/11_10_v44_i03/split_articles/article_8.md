Austin stared straight past the Rolos, Snickers, and Skittles at the New York City subway map taped to the newsstand window. When I called to him, he merely blinked and continued tracing the map’s lines with his eyes. I took his hand and tried to pull him down Third Avenue, but he dug in his heels and screeched. 

Reaching into my pocket, I fished out two quarters and plonked them on the counter. “Here you go, Columbus,” the vendor joked as he slid Austin a flimsy paper map. “Happy exploring.” 

At home, I watched Austin unfold the map on his floor, next to his perfect column of Hot Wheels. Red, green, and orange lines dashed through the map’s ochre boroughs and gray-blue waterways. At the top, in the Bronx, they diffused like a child’s outstretched fingers, curving to their respective termini: Van Cortlandt, Woodlawn, Wakefield, Eastchester, Pelham Bay. 

Austin gazed hardest at upper Manhattan, where the routes straightened out and were joined by the cobalt A-line. Like many autistic children, Austin has always preferred straight to twisting. Straight is predictable. Straight is safe.  

Below 59th Street, south of the mossy rectangle of Central Park, the red, green, orange, and blue routes bisected cross-town yellow, gray, and purple routes in such a jumble Austin had to use his finger to keep himself on track. At Manhattan’s southern tip, the lines extended through the East River, splitting suddenly when they hit Brooklyn’s shore and dispersing inland like capillaries. 

The map quickly revealed Austin’s obsessive study habits. The lines became sticky: he had paved them in syrup as he traced their contours over breakfast. The starchy paper wrinkled and ripped: he often slept with the map under his pillow, as if hoping its contents would osmose into his memory. The bottom eighth of the map was torn away: Austin had inadvertently submerged the Upper Bay in real water during a bath. 

After a few weeks with the map, Austin knew how to travel from Columbia to NYU, the Financial District to Harlem, and DUMBO to the Upper East Side. He could tell you the 6 train’s every stop, where the F crossed the East River, and the exact street where the 1 merges with the 2 and 3. And yet he had never actually traveled by subway. 

Though he has become more flexible, Austin once responded to unexpected situations with the virulence most save for life-threatening emergencies. Abrupt noises led to howls, surprising sights to foot-stomping, and unanticipated contact to head-banging. Exposing
