Long before ABP, Liggett’s Drugs occupied the corner of York and Elm.
Iannuzzi, and Cobden spoke of 
Kerin, an pricy eco-fashion store 
that lasted less than a year at the 
southwest corner of Broadway 
and York in the space that Gant 
now occupies. “I think people just 
thought, well it’s Yale so we can go 
really high-end,” Johnson mused. 
Kerin is not the only business that 
has failed in recent years. Whims-
el’s, a creperie owned by two Yale 
graduates, closed less than two years 
after opening. York Square Cinema 
stopped playing films in 2005 after 
years of struggling with motion 
picture companies to obtain rights 
to blockbuster films. Cosi closed 
in 2008, citing a drop in customers.

The current make-up of the block 
reflects a comprehensive and sys-
tematic plan for the development 
and operation of the Broadway 
district by the two groups that pos-
sess nearly all the real estate. Besides 
Yale, the largest landowner in the 
Broadway district is the Vitigliano 
family. These New Haven real es-
tate magnates own the buildings 
where Campus Customs hawks Yale 
gear, Urban Outfitters sells trendy 
clothing, and the Educated Bur-
gher serves up greasy diner food. 
In December 2003 the holdings of 
the Vitigliano family were placed in 
the care of a real estate investment 
group called the Yale Mall Partner-
ship, which represents the shared 
property of the Vitagliano siblings, 
according to the online records of 
the New Haven town clerk. The 
Vitaglianos have worked alongside 
Yale’s urban renewal initiatives, en-
tering into multiple agreements with 
the University regarding leasing 
practices on the block since 2007. 
From their University Properties of-
fice, Yale arranges extensive Broad-
way promotion, including College 
Night, which draws students from 
local colleges and universities for a 
night of discounts, live music, and 
prizes. According to Cobden, Ian-
nuzzi, and Anne Johnson, the man-
ager of Laila Rowe, the night pro-
vides increased profits for the stores 
that take part. All three credited 
Yale for planning and promoting 
the event--the university, in its role 
as landlord, even arranged for the 
sidewalks to be cleaned before and 
after. That dual act of promotion 
and maintenance is a part of the 
regular routine on Broadway. Drew 
Ruben ’11, owner of Blue State 
Coffee which has five locations in 
Boston, Providence, and New Ha-
ven, said he is not aware of any 
other landlord who does so much 
active marketing for their tenants.


Iannuzzi readily acknowledges that 
“Yale put together the plan to de-
velop the area. They spent a lot of 
money and made the place look 
great.” That said, the extra-special 
treatment comes at a price.  In ex-
change for its services, Yale requires 
adherence to certain standards of 
operation from its occupants. The 
commandments are few: Stores must 
stay open until at least 9 o’clock Sun-
day through Thursday and they must 
keep generous holiday hours. Gour-
met Heaven has to display fresh 
fruit on the sidewalk. When a tenant 
breaks the rules, they pay a fine. Yet 
this strong discipline has strength-
ened 
Broadway’s 
renaissance. 
Before Kerin, a fast-food chain 
claimed the southwest corner on 
York and Broadway, recalled John-
son. As he tells it, Yale “got them 
out of there.”  The restaurant served 
lunch and dinner, sold liquor and 
played music for dancing. They va-
cated the premises about a year after 
the property transferred into Yale’s 
possession, according to Cobden. 
He says the owners became “disen-
chanted with the area,” and then cau-
tiously added that he does not know 
if Yale was involved in the move. It 
certainly wouldn’t be the only time. 
The University has publicly used its 
ownership to ease out stores that 
“didn’t add to the district,” as Matt 
Jacobs ’98, Director of Operations 
for Yale University Properties in 
the early ’00s, put it. For example, 
in 2000, the University refused to 
renew the lease for the convenience 
store Krauszer’s, citing its high pric-
es and poor selection. University 
Properties also cited the failure of 
Bill Kalogeridis, owner of the Cop-
per Kitchen on Chapel Street, to 
comply with safety regulations to 
explain why Yale never offered him 
the security of five-year lease con-
tract instead of month-to-month 
payments. In an interview with the 
Yale Daily News, however, Kalog-
eridis suggested that the University 
wanted to force his business out to 
make room for another boutique. 
Cobden acknowledged that the 
changes Yale has made along the 
way—the corporate presence, the 
rules—did not always feel good. But 
a relativist appreciation for Yale’s in-
volvement prevails. For now, Broad-
way merchants like Cobden are ready 
to believe that Yale’s involvement 
is for the best. “This is not change 
that really hurts,” he explained. 
The merchants are not about to 
bite the hand that feeds them even 
if it does demand some new dis-
