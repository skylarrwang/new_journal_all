   ENDNOTE
’12, “that little girl with the same 
name as you.” As Mrs. Koskoff 
readied herself for the Yale-
Princeton Glee Club concert, Mr. 
Koskoff and I left to get good seats.

“W
hen I go to Sudler shows, 
                                     it’s like crashing a wonderful 
party,” confided Mr. Koskoff, as 
we walked down York Street. We 
entered Morse College, passing 
three girls in costume, and Mr. 
Koskoff shouted, “Are you in the 
play?” He found two middle-
aged women outside the theater 
and approached them, asking: 
“Got someone in the show?” In 
fact, Mr. Koskoff was delighted 
to learn, one was the mother of 
the director, Danielle Tomson ’12. 
He complimented The History 
Boys, the last play Tomson 
directed, gushing: “It was the 
high point of last year’s theater!” 
I excused myself for a 
moment and returned to find Mr. 
Koskoff rubbing elbows with 
another adult couple—one actor’s 
parents, he had discovered. We were 
still five minutes early, and the doors 
hadn’t opened. “The students always 
get here late,” said Mr. Koskoff, 
“but I always get there right on time, 
so they don’t give my seat away.” 
(Normally, house managers of 
Yale shows don’t close the theater’s 
doors until 10 or 15 minutes 
after the play’s scheduled start.)

As 
Mr. 
Koskoff 
had 
learned from the Yale Drama 
Coalition site, this was the North 
American premiere of a Kosovar 
playwright’s work—and even by 
Yale standards, the play, billed as a 
comedy, was weird. Some scenes 
occurred with the lights completely 
off. An actor dressed as a bride ran 
up an aisle screaming; later, she 
married a snake-man. There was 
nudity, murder, waxing of hair. 
Always, a television flickered in the 
background, showing singers, war 
footage, burning film. It was a typical 
example of the undergraduate 
theater that Mr. Koskoff called 
“too cutting-edge” for his tastes. 
At one point, an actor 
addressed the audience, and 
coming close to where we 
were sitting, she focused on 
Mr. Koskoff. I snuck a glance at 
his face. While another watcher 
might 
have 
looked 
away 
uncomfortably, Mr. Koskoff was 
holding her gaze contentedly—
unfazed. He had seen it all before.

A
s the play ended, Mr. Koskoff 
           turned to me. “I don’t know 
where they get off calling it a 
comedy,” he said. A true critic, 
Mr. Koskoff respects the efforts 
of these undergraduates enough 
to expect professionalism, while 
parents and friends will simply 
smile 
unconditionally 
and 
congratulate the cast. Audience 
members with an understanding 
and appreciation as acute as Mr. 
Koskoff’s are unusual at these 
plays. As he and I stood to go, the 
producer asked the audience to 
recycle our programs, returning 
them to a bin for use the next night. 
In spite of his critique, 
Mr. Koskoff ignored the producer’s 
request. When we left, he was 
still holding his program. I asked 
if he would keep it. “I always 
keep them,” he said, and we 
walked out of the Morse College 
basement, programs in hand.
