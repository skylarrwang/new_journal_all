Austin to the subway, it seemed, 
would not be wise. If it weren’t 
the blaring jazz bands, the jostling 
businessmen, or the homeless 
panhandlers, something was sure 
to set Austin off.

But one day, Austin and 
his babysitter, Bara, had no 
choice. Late for Austin’s therapy 
appointment, they rushed from 
our apartment building to find 
it was pouring and there were 
no available taxis. Braving the 
subway was the only sure way to 
be on time.  

As he tiptoed down the 
slippery steps of 76th Street station, 
Austin held Bara’s index finger 
with his left hand and covered 
an ear with his right, trying 
to muffle the din. When they 
reached the platform, commuters 
stared as he rhythmically shifted 
his weight from foot to foot 
and compulsively clicked his 
tongue.  After a few interminable 
minutes, the 6 train rolled in and 
he released Bara’s hand, bursting 
into a flurry of arm-flapping. 
“Calm 
hands, 
Austin,” 
Bara pled. They sidled into the 
smooth plastic chairs, still warm 
from their previous occupants, 
and he continued flailing. As 
he reached around for a safety 
belt out of habit (in the subway, 
there are none), Austin glimpsed 
something 
familiar: 
a 
huge 
subway map hanging behind his 
seat. He faced forward and rested 
his hands in his lap. Under his 
breath he muttered the stops he 
knew came next: 68th Street, 59th 
Street, 51st Street, Grand Central 
Station.  

“See,” Bara said, more to 
herself than to Austin. “Not so 
bad.”

The train jolted out of the 
station, and a woman holding 
a cat carrier lunged forward, 
steadying herself by pressing a 
wrinkled hand against Austin’s 
knee. Bara braced for an explosion 
--—Austin 
abhorred 
being 
touched, even by our mother—
but it never came. Instead, he 
stared blankly at the woman, 
then calmly turned his gaze back 
toward the map, his sliver-thin 
lips pursed in contentment. 

He knew where he was 
going. 

Austin’s experience on the 
subway fueled his fixation with 
maps. Like a safety blanket, a 
map came to mean comfort. 
Maps made him master of the 
unforeseen. 

After digesting the subway’s 
24 lines and 468 stops, he 
memorized 
the 
meandering 
metropolitan highway system 
that connects New York City to 
our grandmother’s nursing home 
in Rye. By his first visit to Yale, 
he could instruct me to walk 
down Chapel Street past College, 
Temple, Church, Orange, State, 
and Olive to meet my family 
at Pepe’s, a pizzeria over a mile 
from central campus in an area of 
New Haven I had never explored 
and he had seen only on a map. 
After inhaling a mozzarella pie, 
he navigated as my Dad drove 
his SUV through the Elm City’s 
byzantine network of one-way 
streets back to Route 34. 

For the last few years, Austin’s 
obsession has included imaginary 
maps. When I come home from 
school, he insists that we play The 
Game of LIFE with my middle 
brother, Jared. He doesn’t fully 
understand the rules but gleefully 
plops his plastic station wagon 
along the serpentine track. He 
reminds Jared and me to “STOP!” 
at the red spaces signifying major 
life events: JOB SEARCH, GET 
MARRIED, FIND A HOUSE. 

According to the game’s rule 
manual, “players must stop on 
these spots “even if the spin is 
greater than the number needed 
to land on them.” 

I’m not an expert—in my 
own life I’ve yet to reach the first 
of those red squares—but I know 
that real life doesn’t resemble 
either a LIFE game board or 
a subway map. Journeys get 
derailed, paths change, and there 
are no scheduled stops. This is 
particularly true for Austin. 

	
Maybe one day he will 
experience the rites of passage 
LIFE demands of its players. 
Maybe, as he has done in the 
game, he’ll buy a Victorian 
mansion, find a wife, and land a 
job as an airplane mechanic. Or 
maybe he’ll live with one of us—a 
small blue action figure in one of 
our station wagons. We just can’t 
know. There is no map.
