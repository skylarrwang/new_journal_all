NUMBERS
GAME: an investigation of eating disorders at Yale
    FEATURE
that when most people hear about 
someone with an eating disorder, 
they want to ask, “Why can’t she just 
go eat a hamburger?” not realizing 
how little these mental illnesses 
have to do with the food itself. It’s 
the same question parents and 
friends want to ask when they first 
confront one of these illnesses—
the  simple, naïve, and desperate 
question: Why can’t you just eat?
For 
God’s 
sake, 
just 
eat!
A
lex is unusual in that she may 
       be exactly what many 
people think of when they think 
of a girl with anorexia. (She has 
also been through periods of 
bulimia, exercise bulimia, and binge 
eating.) In high school, she was a 
valedictorian and a cheerleader. 
“In Texas, we do cheerleading the 
way people do piano lessons,” she 
says. She started in fourth grade. 
Cheer was a class in high school, 
in addition to practice after school. 
She was also on a competitive 
cheerleading 
team 
unaffiliated 
with the school. “I was expected 
to be a certain way,” she says. The 
uniforms for her competitive cheer 
squad had low necklines and were 
cut just above the girls’ thighs.
As I have done with the names 
of the other students in this piece, 
I’ve changed Alex’s name to write 
about her eating disorder, which 
began to develop when she was in 
tenth grade. In eleventh grade, her 
cheer coach told her she couldn’t 
continue at her low weight, but Alex 
didn’t make any effort to change her 
eating patterns. So when she came 
to Yale, the weekly weigh-ins made 
her eating unpredictable. “Numbers 
just make you more paranoid. If you 
gain a pound, you don’t see it as a 
good thing,” she said. “Unless you’ve 
made the decision to get better, 
you’re really pissed at yourself.”
If 
Alex’s 
weight 
increased 
during a week, she would be more 
restrictive in the following week. 
Yet Alex wanted to stay at Yale, so 
when she lost weight, she would 
binge. “It’s the scariest situation,” 
she told me. “You just can’t stop.”
case 
shows 
what 
mandatory weigh-ins can and can’t 
accomplish. Yale can effectively 
force students to accept treatment 
by offering them a choice between 
going to the clinic and going home. 
But since nobody can begin to 
recover from an eating disorder 
until he or she has decided that 
she wants to be healthy, the 
school can’t force anyone to be 
healthy. All the system can really 
do 
is 
prevent 
hospitalizations.
When I wrote Yale psychiatrist 
Dr. Carole Goldberg to ask about 
the 
weigh-ins, 
she 
responded 
simply, “Weigh-ins are necessary 
when someone’s weight is at a 
dangerous/life threatening BMI,”1 
and added that students have the 
choice whether they want to see 
their body weights, in other words 
whether they step on the scale 
forward or backward. Alex noted 
that the choice is never made clear 
to students who are coming in to be 
weighed. She adds that if a person 
with an eating disorder hasn’t 
decided they want to improve, they 
won’t ask for their weight to remain 
hidden, and even if they are given 
the choice, they might still want 
to know. A better policy might be 
to require Student Medicine staff 
to explicitly offer every student 
being weighed the choice of seeing 
her weight or even to disallow 
her 
from 
seeing 
weight.
Alex is still alarmingly thin, and 
food can still be difficult for her. She is 
barely above the school’s minimum 
BMI right now, she confides. “I’ve 
been above and below the line 
so many times, I can’t count.”
I
t 
almost 
impossible 
for 
a 
person 
    who has not experienced 
an eating disorder to understand 
what it is like to suffer from one. Try 
imagining, I’m told, that someone 
follows you around everywhere 
you go, berating you for what 
she sees as your shortcomings. 
This person also talks incessantly 
about food, telling you how many 
calories are in the food around you, 
calculating how many you’ve eaten, 
multiplying calories by servings, 
adding up meals and subtracting 
how long you’ve exercised and 
how many steps you’ve taken. She’s 
exact. She will certainly remind 
you about things like mayonnaise 
on a sandwich or the milk and 
sugar in your coffee (although 
people 
with 
eating 
disorders 
tend to drink their coffee black).
Or imagine that not eating for 
you is like cigarettes for a chain-
smoker; that vomiting puts you in a 
good mood. Imagine that you have 
suppressed your body’s ability to 
feel hunger and satiety, that food is 
no longer food for you. A longtime 
family friend offers you a plate of 
homemade cookies, and when you 
take one you pick it up as you would 
pick up a spider. When you eat it, 
you pledge, “This is the last cookie 
I will ever eat in my life.” When you

of scar on Alex’s 
mind; for just about 
every food she has 
eaten, the disease 
carved a number 
into her memory.
lex 
knows 
how 
many 
calories 
     are in an egg. 
She knows how many calories 
are in a yolk, and how many are 
in the white. “That’s something I 
will know for the rest of my life,” 
she said. “That’s a raw fact. That’s 
like three times three for me.”
The number of calories is only 
one side of the equation, though. 
The number of pounds is the other, 
and for a while, Alex wasn’t the only 
one closely tracking Alex’s body 
weight. Yale requires some students 
with abnormally low body weights 
to present themselves at Student 
Medicine once a week to be 
weighed. Students whose weights 
do not increase are asked to leave 
the school for medical reasons. Alex 
was weighed once a week when she 
was a freshman. At the clinic, she 
would list what she had eaten that 
week on a form, though not always 
truthfully, urinate in a cup so she 
couldn’t water-load to hide weight 
loss, and change into a paper gown 
so she couldn’t hide weights in 
the pockets of her clothes. Then 
she would step onto the scale.
For me, a young adult male of 
average height and weight, it was 
hard to see why the school would 
consider treating Alex’s case with 
such draconian severity. In a society 
obsessed with food, what makes 
these  particular students’ obsession 
with food so dangerous? And I was 
taken aback when Alex, who on the 
whole seems healthy and perfectly 
sane, revealed she could still recite 
caloric contents for so many foods. 
Anorexia left a kind of scar on 
Alex’s mind; for just about every 
food she has eaten, the disease 
carved a number into her memory.
