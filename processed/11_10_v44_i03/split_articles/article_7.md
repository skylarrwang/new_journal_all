wake up in the morning on a day 
when you know you won’t have 
time to work out, you start figuring 
out how you will eat less to make 
up for it. You never weigh yourself, 
because the last time you weighed 
yourself the amount of weight you 
had gained was so terrifying you 
didn’t leave your room for four 
days, nauseated with despair. It’s 
easier not to go to social gatherings 
than to go and refuse food that’s 
offered to you, and it’s easier not 
to talk to anyone than to have 
to answer questions about what 
you’re doing to yourself, so you 
spend a lot of time on your own. 
You hide from your roommates so 
they don’t notice you coming back 
from your second trip to the gym in 
a day. You start measuring bananas 
to make sure they aren’t longer 
than the standard size for bananas 
used in calculating caloric intake.
Measuring 
bananas 
is 
important, 
because 
there 
are 
always numbers in your head. 
Calories, grams, cups, servings, 
steps, miles, bites, pounds. Smaller 
numbers are good and exciting; 
larger numbers are frightening. 
If it seems as though everything 
you know is falling apart, numbers 
are something you can control. 
They reduce all your problems into 
one problem, like a math problem 
with one right answer, and losing 
weight is like solving the problem 
and getting the right answer.


That was the mindset of Aimee 
Liu, a junior at Yale in 1974, when 
eating lunch with Jen, a Political 
Science-African 
Studies 
double 
major, and Lia, an Economics major. 
That day, Liu remembers in her 
2007 bestseller Gaining: The Truth 
About Life After Eating Disorders, Jen 
and Lia, both seniors, were planning 
out their lives after graduation.
“As Lia chewed her tuna 
fish 
sandwich,” 
Liu 
writes, 
“I 
was calculating that one bite 
contained 50 calories, five grams of 
carbohydrates, and four grams of fat. 
The mayonnaise made the waxed 
paper glint in the bright sun. I tried 
to imagine not noticing the oil, not 
thinking about the water weight 
the salt from the Fritos would cause. 
I tried to understand how Lia could 
ignore what she was putting into 
her mouth and focus on her future.”


This was in 1974, although it 
might as well have been written 
in 2010. Liu was in the third class 
of women to graduate from Yale. 
“There were a lot of us walking 
around campus with anorexia, 
and a lot of us, less obviously, with 
bulimia,” she told me. “It appalls 
me now to look back on what I 
squandered when I was at Yale. 
The eating disorder had really 
stunted my brain. I couldn’t read 
properly, I couldn’t think properly, 
because my brain was starved.”


Liu has spent much of the 
intervening decades learning and 
writing about eating disorders. She 
asked me to make sure I mentioned 
the book in this article, since she 
feels that it offers useful advice on 
how to recover or help someone 
recover from an eating disorder. 
Her own recovery took several 
years, and began, as she recalls in 
Gaining, with a love affair. In her 
junior year, she met a graduate 
student studying sculpture. People 
with eating disorders, she told 
me, need “friends, lovers, who are 
not judgmental, who have the 
patience to look past the eating 
disorder and really separate the 
person from the condition, who 
treat food as an expression of love 
and affection and acceptance,” who 
can help someone learn not to 
see food as being right or wrong.


An 
estimated 
percent 
of 
college students suffer from an 
eating disorder (most of whom are 
women—there are about seven 
women with anorexia or bulimia 
nervosa for every man).  Yet there are 
at least two reasons why students 
at a school such as Yale might 
be more likely to develop eating 
disorders, 
especially 
anorexia. 
There’s 
a 
correlation 
between 
anorexia and personality traits 
that could make an anorexic high 
school senior more likely to attend 
a selective college. “Obsessional 
perfectionists are at increased risk 
for anorexia nervosa, so vulnerable 
individuals are often high achievers 
academically,” Dr. Angela Guarda, 
director of the Eating Disorders 
Program at the Johns Hopkins 
Hospital, explained in an e-mail. 
Other researchers noted that the 
stress of leaving home for the 
first time, which brings on eating 
disorders in many predisposed 
freshmen, might be compounded 
by 
the 
intensely 
competitive 
environment at a school such as Yale.


Eating disorders were not yet 
recognized as mental illnesses 
when Liu was at Yale. “There wasn’t 
any treatment,” she said. “I went to 
DUH (Department of University 
Health) and actually tried to get 
some help, and instead, people 
just said, you need to gain a little 
weight. Period. End of story.”


I briefly described Alex’s weigh-
ins for Liu. “The weighing thing 
is really tricky—it’s really really 
tricky, because it’s not the only 
barometer of health, and it’s such 
a humiliating exercise for people 
to go through, especially if they’re 
singling out certain people for 
this treatment,” she said.“It doesn’t 
sound like a great policy to me, 
but on the other hand I don’t have 
an easy solution or an alternative.”


S
ymptoms of anorexia are 
   commonly described in 
medical literature of the 17th, 18th, 
and 19th centuries, but physicians 
then did not distinguish eating 
disorders from other psychological 
conditions. They termed these 
behaviors 
melancholy, 
hysteria, 
or something equally nonspecific 
and chalked them up to the 
mysterious 
and 
unpredictable 
anatomies 
women.


But as historian Rudoph M. Bell 
argues in his book Holy Anorexia, 
an epidemic which can now be 
identified as anorexia nervosa 
struck European convents in the late 
medieval period. The sisters aspired 
to an ideal of holiness as some 
anorexic women of today aspire to 
an ideal of beauty. According to Bell’s 
research, more than half of the 170 
female saints who lived in Europe 
since the year 1200 and for whom 
a reliable historical record exists 
“displayed clear signs of anorexia”. 
St. Catherine of Siena, born in 
that city in 1347, was “the classic 
anorexic,” in Liu’s words. She was 
also an active and influential figure 
during her life, tirelessly caring for 
the sick in convent hospitals and 
helping to persuade Pope Gregory 
XI to return the papacy to Rome 
from Avignon, France, where the 
papal court had lain since 1309. 
Her restrained eating habits were 
also well known, however, and 
many, including her family, thought 
she was possessed or a witch.


No one really understands the 
combination of social, psychological, 
and genetic or chemical factors that 
cause eating disorders. But fasting 
in Catherine’s day suggests those 
mechanisms predate our time. 


 think this campus has a 
terrible problem, and I think 
people need to talk about it,” 
Tonya had said at the end of our 
first meeting. We had been talking 
outside a coffee shop, smartly 
dressed graduate students and 
older, professorial couples with 
foreign accents going by on the 
sidewalk. The noise of construction 
equipment came from across the 
street, where a university building 
was undergoing renovations. It 
was a warm fall day, the leaves just 
beginning to turn. At one point, 
someone Tonya knew to have 
an eating disorder walked past 
us. “This is not the best place to 
be in recovery,” Tonya remarked.


Eating disorders, particularly 
anorexia, can make people viciously 
competitive, driven to look thinner 
than the thinnest of their peers, to 
push unhealthy habits to further 
extremes. At Yale, this aspect of the 
illness has created a kind of invisible 
sisterhood whose members are 
often engaged in unspoken and 
potentially dangerous contests with 
one another. Alex called it “a gym 
cult.” “You’re running on the elliptical 
next to a girl,” she said, “and you’re 
like, ‘Her thighs are smaller, but oh, 
my calves are smaller, so it’s O.K.’ It’s 
a sick, sadistic competition, because 
really, 
you’re 
hurting 
yourself.”

Today, Tonya is waiting for 
me just inside the cavernous maw 
of Payne Whitney, Yale’s castle 
of a gymnasium, at the base of 
its nine-storey tower. “So how 
do you envision this working?” 
she asks after we’ve gone inside. 
I didn’t really have a plan. I just 
wanted to follow Tonya to the 
gym and work out with someone 
who 
works 
out 
obsessively.
“I just have to say,” she goes on, 
“cardio is the most solitary thing I do.”


Tonya’s 
symptoms, 
overexercise and daily alternation 
between binges and periods of 
restriction when she was in high 
school, fall into the category 
psychologists call “eating disorder 
not otherwise specified,” or EDNOS. 
She is healthier now than she was 
then, but she still counts calories 
obsessively, and she had recently 
gone to the gym at 10:30 at night 
because she was feeling anxious. 
After working out, she felt better.


“I can never look in the mirror 
and know how I really look, because 
I can’t trust anything about my 
mind,” she had told me. When 
she looks at her abdomen in the 
mirror, “probably 85 percent of the 
time it’s this gross cellulity mass of 
disgustingness. I know that can’t be 
true—physically it just can’t be true.”


She has spent too much time in 
the gym for it to be true, and after 
we’ve taken the elevator to the 
fitness center on the fourth floor, 
I also wonder how she could ever 
think that it could be true. She walks 
past me toward the treadmills—her 
body is muscular and lean. “For 
people I know who have eating 
disorders, it’s not about being thin 
or fit,” Tonya told me. She swam for 
ten years and played field hockey 
in high school, so she was always in 
good shape. She’s never looked thin, 
she told me (“I have a lot of muscle 
mass—thank God, frankly, because 
I would have been dead”) but I can’t 
imagine her ever looking fat either.


She talks rapidly, and I usually 
have to interrupt her if I want to 
ask her a question. “This is what 
it’s like when my eating disorder 
is in the driver’s seat,” she once 
apologized.“Talking so fast and from 
so many angles I want to scream. 
Instead I just work out or deprive 
myself of food.” When Tonya says 
something darkly self-deprecating 
like that, it’s hard to know how to 
respond. On the one hand, her 
jokes can be very funny, and you 
have the feeling she’d like you to 
laugh at them. But you also know 
that she’s joking because it’s a way 
of dealing with what’s happened to 
her, with what she’s done to herself.


I step onto a treadmill beside 
her, and glancing at the numbers on 
her display, set the speed to one or 
two tenths of a mile below hers. I’m 
reasonably fit, but I have no desire to 
race Tonya, since I’m sure she would 
win. Besides, in the back of my mind 
there’s a story she told me about 
a trip to the gym in her residential 
college 
one 
day 
last 
spring.


The gym was busy, and there 
was only one treadmill free. Tonya 
left her wallet and keys on the 
treadmill to reserve it and went 
to the bathroom, but when she 
returned another girl had moved 
her things off the treadmill and was 
running on it. The other girl was also 
struggling with an eating disorder, 
Tonya knew, by that frightening 
instinct many people with eating 
disorders seem to have for picking 
out others with similar problems. 
Tonya and the girl on the treadmill 
began to argue and scream at 
each other. Later, Tonya wrote an 
enraged email to her therapist 
and nutritionist. “I hope she falls 
down five flights of stairs, breaks 
both legs, and gains 50 pounds,” 
she 
remembers 
telling 
them. 
“That’s how I felt,” she tells me. 


I look over at a girl stretching 
on the mats next to us. She is very 
flexible and bony, and I find myself 
wondering about her, though I 
wouldn’t have given her a second 
thought before I began reporting 
this article. I steal glances at her 
elbows, her hair, the tendons in her 
neck, and the knock of her knees, 
looking for anything abnormal. 
That’s not how Tonya would see her, 
I realize, even if Tonya were still as 
sick as she once was. Would Tonya 
instead have admired the bones 
in her calves, the self-denial in her 
drawn cheeks? I can only imagine.


The gym is strangely quiet. It’s 
a big room, and any human noise 
is lost in the whirr of the ventilation 
and the machines. The girl on the 
mat leaves, and a while later, after 
Tonya has gone for a spin on one of 
the stationary bikes, she and I are on 
the treadmills again, cooling down.
“You 
caught 
me 
on 
an 
abnormally good workout day,” 
she says. “I’m not, like, dying.”
“I am, a little bit,” I admit.


The two of us run through 
some sit-ups and push-ups and 
get ready to go. “I have mountains 
of work,” Tonya says. The life 
of a Yale student: reading and 
studying until late tonight, at 
work until 1 tomorrow afternoon, 
and class at 2:30 until evening. 
We walk down rows of people on 
treadmills, ellipticals, stair-steppers, 
stationary 
bikes, 
recumbent 
bikes, and rowing machines. Is 
this an especially healthy subset 
of the Yale population, or one 
that 
peculiarly 
diseased?


“One more thing,” Tonya offers, 
as we descend the stairs down to 
the main floor. She takes the stairs 
down from the fourth floor fitness 
center, but she always takes the 
elevator up. “That’s my concession 
to myself, that I don’t have to do 
everything. Basically, I’m weird.”


I tell Tonya she seems quite 
healthy to me. She does, especially 
given some of the stories I’ve heard 
about people who are very ill.
“I’m working on it. I’m working 
on it, and that’s what counts.”


I
t can be difficult not to feel in 
    awe of someone like Tonya 
her 
inhuman 
routine 
workouts and restricted eating. 
As Kelly put it to me, “Anorexia 
makes you superhuman in ways 
that eventually make you die.”


A year ago last summer, Kelly 
decided to go for a run. She came 
home tired out after about five 
minutes. The next day, she ran for 
fifteen minutes. The day after that, 
she ran for three miles. She ran every 
day after that, adding other exercises 
to her routine and beginning to 
restrict her eating. She was anorexic 
before leaving for Europe for a term 
abroad at the end of the summer.


Much of the time she was sick 
she does not remember. “It feels 
like a different person,” she told me. 
“In a lot of ways I think it was. It is.”


Kelly remembers announcing 
to her friends one day in high 
school that she could never become 
anorexic because she would be 
too hungry. “I was a dorky kid who 
watched the Food Network,” she told 
me. As a teenager, she would throw 
fancy dinner parties at her house for 
her friends on her birthday, cooking 
and baking all day. Her mother 
was the sous-chef and her father, 
with a towel over his arm, was 
the waiter. I asked Kelly about her 
favorite dishes to prepare: squash 
soup, handmade gnocchi with 
homemade pesto and tomatoes 
and red peppers, crème caramels, 
trifles, berry compotes and coulis. “I 
loved macerating berries in alcohol. 
That was one of my favorite things 
to do.” In fact, many people who 
suffer from eating disorders loved 
to cook as children or become 
fascinated by cooking, cookbooks, 
and cooking shows, perhaps as a 
way of vicariously enjoying food.


Now, Kelly is earnest and 
cheerful 
deliberately, 
exaggeratedly sarcastic (“Oh, that’s 
interesting!”). When 
came 
home from Europe in the middle of 
her program there, almost exactly 
a year before I met her, she was 
lifeless. Her physician explained 
to her family that her brain had 
enough 
energy 
for 
breathing 
and walking and not much else.


Kelly was able to return to 
Yale in time for the start of the 
spring term. Compared to many 
students here who have suffered 
from eating disorders for years, 
Kelly thinks she’s fortunate. Her 
recovery is indeed impressive. “This 
was a real disease, and I needed to 
make it better,” she said. “It’s not 
just a condition, but a malfunction, 
and I could correct it.” She did.
“I am a smart person. I 
know that not eating is not 
smart 
idea,” 
laughed.


I met Kelly’s parents the day 
they came to Yale to see her last a 
cappella concert, where they sat a 
few rows in front of me, her mother 
watching the show through her 
digital camera, even though the 
group records all its shows with 
professional equipment. Kelly is an 
alto. She had a cold that afternoon, 
but couldn’t bear to miss her 
Measuring is important, 
because there are always numbers in your head. 
Calories, grams, cups, servings, steps, miles, bites, pounds.

final show. She soloed on the 
closing medley, one hand in the 
air, wagging her finger at the 
audience. Sass is the only word for 
what Kelly has on stage. “Thanks 
so much for coming,” she told the 
audience as the singers continued 
behind her. In a moment the song 
was over, someone gave Kelly a 
bouquet for her last performance, 
lights 
on.


A 
scene 
like 
that—the 
hall’s elaborate oaken ceiling 
disappearing into shadow near 
its high peak, Kelly in the center 
of a series of group embraces 
on stage—belongs in a Yale 
College admissions video. But 
the materials Yale sends out to 
tens of thousands of prospective 
freshmen each year do not include 
the stories of those students 
for whom an eating disorder is 
another central component of the 
liberal-arts college experience.


B
y the time St. Catherine of 
     Siena was seven, she 
was throwing meat under the 
table when her mother tried to 
force her to eat. This may not yet 
have been symptomatic of an 
eating disorder, but Catherine 
was almost certainly anorexic by 
her adolescence, when mother 
wanted her to marry her sister’s 
widower and Catherine rebelled 
by fasting continually. Her family 
sent her to their priest, who told 
Catherine to eat once a day. She 
did eat, but she would always 
vomit afterward. This continued 
throughout her life and even 
after she joined a convent—
others would urge her to eat, and 
when she ate she would purge, 
gagging herself with a twig of 
fennel or a goose feather. (She 
continued to take communion.)


Catherine starved to death at 
33. Anorexia nervosa, that very real 
demon born of the human mind’s 
imperfections, is the deadliest 
psychiatric illness. Women with 
anorexia are twelve times more 
likely to die young than women 
without the disease. By the 
sixteenth 
century, 
asceticism 
was heresy, and the Church was 
burning anorexics at the stake.


 few weeks after I first met 
          Alex, I had been taught 
quite a bit about eating disorders, 
but there was still something I 
wanted to try for myself. I had 
written Kelly an email after 
she had told me about a kind 
of tofu-based noodle with no 
carbohydrates called shirataki 
(“because 
pasta—pasta 
has 
actual sustenance! You can’t have 
that.”). She replied with a link to a 
website offering women recipes 
with very-low-calorie ingredients. 
According to the site’s author, 
Lisa Lillien, the noodles are “an 
AMAZING pasta swap…As long 
as you prepare them right. It’s 
really important to rinse them, 
drain them, and dry them. Sure 
they’re a little high maintenance, 
but they’re totally worth it. I 
mean—HELLO!?—they 
have 
only 20 calories per serving!!!”


I find the noodles at 
a small grocery store around 
the corner from my dormitory 
where Kelly directed me, along 
with a small wheel of low-calorie 
cheese that she suggested in 
her email “(which, P.S., if you 
have only 35 calories YOU ARE 
NOT CHEESE).” While the clerk 
swipes 
noodles, 
cheese, 
and a can of tomato sauce, I 
ask if the shirataki are popular. 
He restocks them every week.


I’ve arranged to use my 
friends’ kitchen this evening. 
Before the apartment’s tenants 
leave 
with 
key, 
my 
notebook, and my very-low-
calorie food, I have to ask one of 
them to look up a word for me. 
Next to the logo of Lillien’s web 
site indicating her endorsement, 
the instructions on the back of 
the packages of the shirataki 
read, “Parboil for 2-3 minutes to 
remove authentic aroma. Dry 
very well.” To parboil just means to 
boil partially, although, according 
to Wikipedia, “Parboiling can 
also be used for removing 
poisonous 
or 
foul-tasting 
substances 
from 
foodstuffs.”


The 
noodles 
packaged in liquid and need to be 
drained first in a colander in the 
sink. They are weirdly white and 
gelatinous, sitting in the colander, 
but otherwise unremarkable. I lift 
a forkful to my nose to see if I can 
pick up the “authentic aroma.”


It’s 
certainly 
there—faint, 
but entirely nauseating, like 
rotting fish, but sweeter. The 
noodles go into a pot of boiling 
water, and the smell fills the 
kitchen for a few moments before 
dissipating. I let them parboil 
longer than the recommended 
two to three minutes to be safe. 
It’s not long enough to cook 
them, though, and it’s now 
apparent to me that the noodles 
must be edible directly out of 
the package and that boiling is 
only necessary to eliminate the 
smell. After straining, rinsing, 
and drying, I throw some of the 
noodles on a plate, ladle tomato 
sauce on top, and sit down.


The sauce is too red, the 
noodles are too white. And there 
is still something sickly sweet, 
papery, and foul about the 
smell—I feel my gag reflex when 
I raise my fork to my mouth. Kelly 
definitely didn’t warn me about 
this. The noodles have no flavor, 
though. Apparently shirataki, like 
some other Asian foods, smells 
much worse than it tastes. Except 
that when you bite the noodles 
as you would pasta, they squish 
but don’t quite come apart. 
You have to slurp them down 
your throat or chew for a longer 
time than feels comfortable.


The second course is 
the “horribly fake alfredo” Kelly 
mentioned in her e-mail, made 
with the cheese that is not cheese. 
The noodles don’t smell as much, 
presumably since they’ve had 
a little more time to dry. But the 
cheese tastes just a little sharper 
than cheese should. It’s a chemical 
flavor. And you’d never know 
how much flavor plain pasta has 
unless you were to try shirataki.


It’s very filling. Since 
I’m not anorexic, I made sure 
to eat a healthy dinner before 
coming 
here, 
but 
should 
have listened more carefully to 
Kelly—the noodles don’t have 
many calories, but they take 
up space in your stomach. It’s 
like drinking too much water. 


 week after her concert, 
          Kelly and I had agreed 
to meet up outside of Froyo 
World (110 calories per K serving, 
I later learned). But there was a 
bit of a chill in the autumn air 
that afternoon, and Kelly was still 
getting over her cold, so instead 
we decided to walk a couple of 
blocks to a bookstore and café 
where we had met before. Kelly 
apologized and suggested the 
two of us have dinner sometime 
when she was feeling better. Not 
wanting frozen yogurt because 
you have a cold shouldn’t be 
anything to apologize for. “If I were 
a normal human being, I would 
just do what I wanted,” she said. 
As long as she can’t without 
second-guessing 
herself, 
hasn’t recovered entirely. “It’s not 
something that just goes away,” 
she told me. Her boyfriend had 
been asking about her eating 
since she’d come down with the 
cold. That week she had also asked 
her Biological Anthropology T.A. to 
be excused from an assignment on 
human diet that involved keeping 
track of everything she ate for 
several days. “I can remember 
being so normal, and then this 
block of crazy, and now I’m here.”


Few 
people 
would 
call 
students at a school such as Yale or 
the environment in which we work 
and live “normal,” but that does not 
mean we all have eating disorders. 
When Kelly says she is not normal, 
she means it differently. Yale 
students are more susceptible 
than the general population to the 
common cold, because we don’t 
sleep enough and spend much 
of our time in close proximity to 
one another. That does not mean 
a person with a disease is healthy, 
that there is nothing that can be 
done to prevent the spread of 
illness, or that people who are sick 
can never get well. That much is true 
of eating disorders as well as colds.


Like Kelly’s, my nose was 
running earlier this fall, too. But I 
have never had an eating disorder, 
and no matter how much I learn 
about obsession and addiction, 
about prevention and treatment or 
about the complicated arithmetic 
that is Kelly’s illness, I will never 
really be able to understand what 
she has experienced. Tomorrow 
morning I can eat something 
nutritious and tasty and enjoy 
it, as I will at lunch and dinner 
and at breakfast the next day. 
For 
some, 
every 
meal 
as 
repulsive 
thisone.
