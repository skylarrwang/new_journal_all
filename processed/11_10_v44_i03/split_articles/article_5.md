The New Journal
WInter 2010-2011
though she likes to thinking things 
have improved.
Even so, this fall, the story of Delta 
Kappa Epsilon’s (DKE) freshmen 
pledges chanting, “no means yes, yes 
means anal,” on Old Campus made 
national news, and Marcus heard 
disturbing echoes of her time here. 
It was as though, in spite of all the 
efforts she and students have made 
since to raise awareness and promote 
sexual respect, nothing had changed. 
Marcus was only slightly heartened 
when she heard that administrative 
action had been taken because, she 
feels, “that doesn’t change the fact 
that the male culture of being a 
douchebag still persists.”
Miller, by contrast, said she 
feels safe here speaking out about 
her sexuality. “It’s great to be 
able to say, ‘Yeah, I was part of a 
progressive institution,’” she said. 
Soon after she arrived on campus, 
she was receiving e-mails from the 
Women’s Center and the LGBTQ 
Co-op about phone campaigns to 
encourage congressmen to repeal 
Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. And when 
Miller, who became something of 
a media celebrity after coming-out 
and leaving West Point publicly 
last spring, needed to miss class for 
an interview or for other advocacy 
activities, she found her professors 
were supportive.
Marcus thinks that if she had 
experienced what she did in 2010 
instead of 1997, somebody might 
have listened. Seeing the mass of 
signatures on an online petition for 
the administration to take action 
in response to the DKE incident 
made her hope that the Internet has 
made it easier to “harness outrage” 
and publicize traumatic events. 
Indeed, this year, the administration 
responded to the incident within 
a week by setting up a task force, 
chastising DKE, and holding a 
number of campus events. When 
Marcus was at Yale, “there was 
nobody to tell,” but this story, and 
that of Katie Miller, suggest things 
have changed. Still, at the same 
university where a story like Marcus’ 
took so long to come to light, there’s 
no way to be sure.

  SHOTS IN THE DARK
“We took our bikes and ex-
plored areas around New 
Haven that people may not 
usually see. We documented 
our travels and ended up 
finding a lot of interesting 
places to explore.”
