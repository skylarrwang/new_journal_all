Tyco beats like the 
heartbeat of a marathoner gone 
aerobic. Founded by Michael Ian-
nuzzi in 1971, the copying and 
printing company is one of the 
few small business that have seen 
the transformation of Broadway. 

Educated Burgher is an-
other. There, a 1984 map of New 
Haven’s businesses still hangs on 
the wall, faded and irrelevant. 

Fewer than half of the businesses 
depicted still exist. There was once 
a movie theater, a wine shop, a re-
cord store, a bar, two more Cut-
ler’s outposts, and a florist—but 
they’ve all gone under, most of 
their properties bought up by Yale. 

Today, Campus Customs, Educated 
Burgher, Blue Jay Cleaners, Toad’s 
Place, Yorkside, and J. Press are 
all that remain from the old guard. 

The revolution began with 
the sidewalks. In the mid-1990s, 
Yale and New Haven partnered 
to make infrastructure improve-
ments — changing traffic patterns 
and storefront signs, renovating 
buildings, burying utility lines, and 
planting elm trees — to combat 
what Iannuzzi classified as the 
sentiment that, as an urban area, 
“we were decaying, but not from 
the standpoint of the business.” 

The New York Times put it more 
bluntly in 1994, stating that the 
area was “plagued by traffic con-
gestion and rampant shabbiness.” 

Yale’s goal was to make it more 
welcoming—to students, busi-
nesses, and those in the community. 

According to Bruce Al-
exander ’65, the Vice President for 
Yale’s office of New Haven and 
State Affairs (NHSA), the trans-
formation he initially imagined ten 
years ago is almost complete—only 
the installation of a handful of fine 
dining spots remain. The change 
has been made possible by Yale’s 
careful management of inter-store 
competition. Yale, which owns 
most of the properties, leases to 
stable corporate businesses such as 
J.Crew, Origins, and Au Bon Pain. 

The University began 
buying up properties from local 
New Haven families who wanted 
to sell, a process accelerated when 
university president Richard Levin 
hired Alexander in 1998. Alexan-
der aggressively recruited new mer-
chants such as Laila Rowe, Urban 
Outfitters, and Thom Browne, and 
brought in Ivy Noodle to serve late-
night dining needs. In a 2001 press 
release, then-University Properties 
financial analyst Andrea Pizziconi 
’01 said that to identify an appropri-
ate 24-hour convenience store “we 
literally walked the streets of New 
York for days,” before deciding on 
Gourmet Heaven. “I don’t think 
the Yale community realizes it,” she 
said. “But Yale is doing some of 
the most innovative and aggressive 
development projects among uni-
versities throughout the country.” 

One of the biggest chang-
es was to introduce national corpo-


rations to Broadway—the first of 
which was Barnes and Noble. Independent businesses owners often 
fear that corporations will be aloof 
and dissociated. In the merchant’s 
association of Broadway, however, 
Iannuzzi said the bookstore is “pro-
gressive and aggressive in being a 
part of the community,” a refresh-
ing reprisal for the smaller business-
es. Despite this diplomatic cour-
tesy, phrases like “elbow their way” 
found their way out of the mouths 
of both Iannuzzi and Barry Cob-
den, manager of Campus Customs, 
when they spoke of larger compa-
nies. Iannuzzi observed that the ar-
rival of stores like J. Crew on a city 
block signaled a change in shopping 
culture — a decade ago, he claimed, 
they would have stayed in the malls. 
“A lot of times you lose if you get 
a corporate coming in,” he con-
cluded. That said, New Haven does 
not have a significant department 
store to draw in traffic, so Barnes 
and Noble now acts as an economic 
anchor. “The nice part about the 
area,” Iannuzzi continued. “Is that 
Yale has sort of wrapped around 
the idea that the environment 
is for the students and the city.” 

The newest addition to the Broad-
way Shopping District, Gant, 
opened this November. Founded 
in New Haven in 1949, the now 
Swiss-owned purveyor of American 
sportswear has 590 stores world-
wide, and likes the idea of “coming 
home,” said Ari Hoffman, CEO of 
Gant U.S.A. in an interview with the 
New Haven Independent in Octo-
ber. “Some people may say, ‘Paris, 
Milan, Italy.’ We say, ‘New Haven.’” 

Gant’s webpage credits founder 
Bernard Gant with introducing the 
classic “button-down shirt” and 
outfitting “the good life and leisure-
ly lifestyles on the American East 
Coast.” Mr. Gant arrived on that 
coast in 1914, a Ukrainian emigrant 
who found employment in New 
York City’s garment district. Yet the 
company uses definitively WASP 
iconography to woo its customers. 

The New Haven Gant store displays 
Take Ivy, a photograph collection 
of Ivy League fashion in the sixties, 
at the register. The Gant catalogue 
narrates in saccharine stereotypes 
the lives Gant men and women liv-
ing in Washington D.C., offering po-
etical summaries of lacrosse games 
and the social lives of politicians. 

A reflection on “The Art of Net-
working” fills the back pages. When 
Gant’s imminent arrival was an-
nounced in October, Abigail Rider, 
Director of University Properties, 
said, “the addition of Gant to the 
retailers on Broadway reaffirms our 
connection with our New England 
traditions.” Gant’s presence suggests 
that these are perhaps traditions of 
aspiration—though only time will 
tell if pricey flannel and football 
jackets will keep the store around. 

After all, University backing does 
guarantee a business’ success. Establishing a commercial business 
remains an exercise in hope and 
crossed fingers. Even when all the 
operative variables are aligned, un-
expected failures occur. Johnson,
