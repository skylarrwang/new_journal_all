T
he Beautiful Game. The 
game said to bring the whole 
world together. I watched 
this summer’s World Cup in Paris, 
France; I have never seen much 
fervent passion, pride and celebration 
surrounding the game of soccer. 
There, banners and flags waved from 
terraces; thousands sat in front of 
JumboTrons; wine glasses and beer 
mugs clinked after victories. There 
were hurrahs, yipees, and profanities. 
Sometimes, there were riots in the 
streets. Before the kickoff, bets 
were high on Brazil, Spain, and the 
Netherlands. Nevertheless, folks from 
across the world wore the flags, shirts, 
and jerseys of their home country—
and could proudly tell you their own 
team would win. Americans, however, 
were quieter about their allegiance. 
Bold as our country’s reputation may 
be, we aren’t quick to proclaim soccer-
supremacy.  We have yet to win a 
World Cup. The fact of the matter is, 
in the soccer world, America does not 
get much respect even from its own 
citizens.  When it comes to baseball, 
we’ve stepped up to the plate. At 
basketball, we’ve made a slam-dunk. 
For football, we need no Hail Mary. 
Soccer, however, is a whole different 
ballgame.  

Some Europeans say our weakness 
lies in the way we train our players. 
In Europe, kids are sent to rigorous 
soccer training schools in hopes of 
someday scoring in a professional club 
contract. Often, they push education 
aside. There, passion for the game 
is inseparable from a drive to win. 
In America, where 
professional 
soccer 
takes a back seat to 
other 
sports, 
the 
primary stage for the 
sport’s higher levels 
are on college fields. 
There, players often 
prioritize school over 
sports, especially at 
rigorous schools like 
Yale. But the teams’ 
passion for the game 
runs strong regardless 
of the score. 

I 
am 
a 
sophomore on Yale 
Women’s 
Soccer 
team, and I’ve witnessed our season—
the growth and the disappointments. 
Our competitive line-up proved 
difficult, stacked with nationally 
ranked teams: Duke, Boston College, 
Illinois, UConn. It was a tough road 
to travel as we faced many losses. 
While an outsider might use more 
colorful adjectives to sprinkle salt 
on our turf burns, many of these 
games were close (1-0, 2-0). Against 
such great competition we began to 
develop our style of play.  

Our coach, Rudy Meredith, 
provides his wisdom. “Number 1: 
We want to play against the best. 
Number 2: This way we have a 
better understanding of where we 
are. Maybe we scheduled too many 
tough games in a row, but it is the 
best feeling in world when you can 
get such an upset,” he says of facing 
difficult opponents. 

The odds are against us. Since Yale 
holds high academic standards, and it 
doesn’t offer athletic scholarships as 
many of its counterparts do, we’re 
at a disadvantage in recruitment. 
“Stanford has the best model,” Rudy 
explains.  “They have good academics 
and scholarships and they are top 
five in the country. And they went 
to the Final Four last year too. If we 
had scholarships we could be just 
like them.” The academic standard 
for Yale’s prospective recruits is 
only increasing. “It’s tough. You 
are narrowing the pool again to get 
the best athlete. But we are at Yale 
University,” he continues. 

For an Ivy League school, 
beating the odds takes a lot of work, 
determination, and dedication.  In 
2004, Princeton made it to the Final 
Four. And I am sure no one on our 
team can forget 2005 (since there 
is not a week where Coach does 
not bring it up); that year, Yale was 
ranked 13th in the nation with a win 
against Duke under its belt. Eleni 
Benson, the captain at the time, 
graduated with the best GPA on the 
team and went off to play with the 
Greek national team in the women’s 
World Cup. During her Yale Career, 
she helped lead YWS to win the Ivy 
League Championships and enter the 
NCAA tournament. 

I am happy to say that I was a 
part of the shake-up of 2010. In our 
season opener we faced Penn State, 
then 16th in the nation. Shaking with 
anxiety, we had no idea what to expect 
from our preseason preparation—and 
Penn State strolled in unfazed, ready 
to crush an Ivy. But 
when the whistle blew, 
I felt a raw energy in 
the air, and my chest 
burned 
with 
nerves 
and excitement. The 
exhilaration rose when 
we realized we were 
dominating the head-
balls, dribbling through 
defenders, and tackling 
dangerous plays. On 
the bench, we stood 
up chanting “Let’s go 
Blue!” with zeal.  In 
the game’s last half 
hour, 
Becky 
Brown 
’11 slotted one in on a 
breakaway, and all the Bulldogs on 
the sideline jumped up, screaming, 
hugging, and laughing. The game 
ended: 1-0, Yale. We all took scissors 
to the Yale Daily News article the next 
day to post that large picture of the 
team running to embrace Becky on 
our Walls: Elis pulled off the upset of 
Nittany Lions, earning the program’s 
first win against a Big Ten team in 
school history.

From that tremendous high, 
we stumbled through the next few 
games, but every day, we kept Penn 
State in the back of our minds, never 
forgetting what we knew we could 


“There are athletes that choose not to come to Yale because it’s too much  
academically, and they’d rather go somewhere they can coast through their 
four years while focusing on sports. It’s often overlooked, but it’s a rare breed 
that is willing to compete academically with non-athletes,”
