his fall, Katie Miller ’13 left 
the United States Military 
Academy at West Point in 
protest of the military’s Don’t Ask, 
Don’t Tell policy, and transferred to 
Yale. “Even before I was interested in 
transferring, I knew it was LGBTQ 
friendly,” she says of the college. 
After all, in 1986, Yale became 
one of the nation’s first universities 
to add sexual orientation to its 
nondiscrimination clause. The next 
year, an article in Rolling Stone 
dubbed the school the “gay Ivy”—an 
epithet that Miller finds appealing. 
She has not been disappointed 
in her first term here, saying she 
has appreciated the support of the 
University as well as her friends and 
classmates.

Fourteen years ago, however, 
a young woman named Sarah 
Marcus transferred from Yale for 
reasons of sexual orientation. By 
her account, Marcus’ and several 
others were harassed and threatened 
with violence because of their 
sexual identity. Marcus felt the 
administration’s responses to these 
incidents were unsympathetic at 
best, and she left Yale for Oberlin 
College in Ohio after the first term 
of her sophomore year. Marcus’ and 
Miller’s stories run parallel, but in 
opposite directions: both transferred 
away from a school where they felt 
repressed, and both, to some extent, 
became 
spokeswomen 
for 
the 
LGBTQ community on campus. 
What can their stories tell us about a 
movement, about the nature of civil 
rights activism, about the history of 
a school?

Today, Sara Marcus is a freelance 
writer who lives in Brooklyn and 
works as an editor for artforum.
com, the online component of 
Artforum International Magazine. 
She came out during her freshman 
year of high school in Maryland—
“but I never really knew what I was 
coming out as,” she says. “Because 
at that time, bisexuality was like, 
Madonna and Sandra Bernhard—it 
wasn’t a legitimate subject.” 
High school was tough, but 
Marcus believed that college would 
bring bigger, better things. She had 
visited her older brother at Oberlin, 
and what she saw there gave her “this 
vision that going to college meant 
everybody’s a feminist, everybody’s 
cool if you’re queer or whatever, 
people hang out in co-op kitchens 
late at night baking loaves of whole 
grain bread listening to punk rock.” 
It never occurred to her that not all 
liberal arts colleges were as tolerant. 
She had high hopes for Yale until 
she arrived on campus.   “And 
then, of course,” she says, “Yale was 
tremendously different.”

Marcus entered Yale a member of 
the class of 1999. She was assigned 
to Morse College—“it felt really 
freeing not to be trapped by this 
weight of history and classical 
pretension of the other colleges”—
and involved herself in student 
labor activism.  By her sophomore 
year, she’d been arrested twice for 
protesting workers’ rights. Soon, 
however, her interest in activism was 
forced to take a different tack. 
Self-defining as queer, Marcus 
joined the LGBTQ Co-op. At a 
coming-out day rally in October 
1996, Marcus, then a sophomore, 
gave a speech condemning the recent 
passage of the Defense of Marriage 
Act, which declared that states were 
not obliged to recognize same-
sex marriages sanctioned by other 
states. Then, she went away on a 
weekend trip. When she returned to 
school, there was a voicemail on her 
answering machine from a man who 
had heard her speak at the rally. 
“Hi Sara, you little dyke,” he had 
recorded. “I’m calling to say that I 
think it’s a shame that you’re a dyke, 
because personally, I’d like to fuck 
you. But I can’t touch you because 
you’ve been licked so much. So I’ll 
just take my fist and fucking tear you 
apart. Thank you.” 

Horrified, Marcus sent an email 
to the Co-op panlist to ask if anyone 
had experienced anything similar. 
What had happened to Marcus 
paled in comparison to the responses 
she 
remembers 
receiving. 
One 
student, Chrysanthi Leon, then a 
visible campus lesbian (she and her 
girlfriend had been featured in a 
Valentine’s Day issue of The Herald) 
and now an assistant professor of 
sociology and criminal justice at the 
University of Delaware, had also 
received threatening phone calls. She 
and her girlfriend had experienced 
other acts of violence, such as being 
surrounded on Chapel Street by 
men who spat on them, which they 
believed to have surged up from an 
undercurrent of violent homophobia 
on campus. Marcus thought, “I’m 
going to organize around this.” She 
pushed aside her work with labor
