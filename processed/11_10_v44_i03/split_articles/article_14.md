occasionally sits in on movie 
screenings for introductory film 
courses, but comedy shows, 
he complained, are too late at 
night. “We still haven’t made 
the 
Masters’ Teas,” 
said 
his 
wife, “and I want to do that.” 
They tried renting an 
apartment in New York, Mr. 
Koskoff explained, then settled 
instead for this pied-à-terre in New 
Haven precisely because it offers 
everything the big city does—
except here, he crowed, they can 
walk everywhere. The Koskoffs 
used to go to the Edinburgh 
Festival Fringe each year, but 
now that they’re in New Haven, 
“every weekend is the Edinburgh 
Fringe!” Mr. Koskoff and his wife 
can readily recall dozens of plays 
they’ve seen; a favorite, Amadeus, 
“was such a wonderful production 
that they could have lifted it up 
and taken it straight to Broadway.” 
“We’ve 
seen 
such 
wonderful things,” cooed Mrs. 
Koskoff, “Only every fourth show, 
of Tom Dodd, the former U.S. 
Senator 
from 
Connecticut. 
Mrs. Koskoff, also a lawyer, 
teaches at Central Connecticut 
State University, serves on the 
Plainville Board of Education, 
and has run for U.S. Congress 
twice. They have no children, 
and 
shouting 
through 
house, they call each other “love.”


As 
Mr. 
Koskoff 
tells 
the story, he and his wife were 
just “casual theater consumers” 
until a 1989 production of Sweeney 
Todd converted the pair to self-
described “Sondheads,” traveling 
cross-country to see productions 
of Stephen Sondheim’s work in 
Chicago and San Francisco. By 1998, 
they were meeting a devoted group 
of fellow Sondheads for dinner 
before a production of Sondheim’s 
Follies in New Jersey. Today, Mr. 
bemoans 
Sondheim’s 
popularity, saying, “the public has 
snatched him away from us,” but he 
still dates his and his wife’s passion 
for theatergoing to this period. 
Now, according to Mr. 
Koskoff, “living on York Street, at 
the edge of the Yale bubble, is the 
very best place for a theater buff 
to be.” He and his wife prefer the 
intimacy of Yale’s undergraduate 
theater to professional plays at 
the Yale Repertory Theatre or 
the Long Wharf Theatre in New 
Haven. In every student show, he 
says, they find at least one actor’s 
performance 
worthwhile—
sometimes 
breathtaking. 
Mr. Koskoff rattled off a list 
of names of stars to watch.


However, before I arrived 
at their apartment for dinner, I 
knew none of this. I knew only that 
the couple I’d seen were faithful 
followers of Yale’s undergraduate 
theater—a scene often considered 
insular. Undergraduate theatergoers 
 “Living on York 
Street, at the 
edge of the Yale 
bubble, is the 
very best place 
for a theater buff 
to be,” says Mr. 
Koskoff.

tend to be theater people themselves, 
and while some plays generate 
considerable excitement within their 
community, that buzz rarely spreads 
across campus. True audience 
members—people who see plays 
not out of obligation to friends, 
but to be entertained—are rare, too.


 “O
h, you didn’t have to bring 
         flowers!” Mr. Koskoff shouted, 
as he opened the door to his 
apartment that night. But his 
wife would love them, he added. 
“Would you like a glass of bad 
white wine?” It’s truly awful, he 
said, but Mr. Koskoff used to own 
a bar, and when it closed, he was 
stuck with this. “I inherited it,” he 
said, sweeping me into a side 
room he called his study, past 
a spacious living room with a 
crowded bookcase,  a massive 
potted rosemary plant, and coffee 
tables topped with David Sedaris 
books—and then Mr. Koskoff cut 
to the chase. From his massive 
desk chair, wine glass in hand, he 
looked me in the eye and said:
“I largely select shows 
based on people that I know, and 
here’s a question for you. In Dead 
Man’s Cell Phone, you have Allison 
Collins [’11]—who is the best 
Charlotte and David Koskoff in their York 
Street apartment.

among her crop—and Hunter Wolk 
[’12]—and Jeremy Lloyd [’12]—
how is it that someone like you, 
who doesn’t have many credits to 
your name, got such good people?” 
I started to squirm and 
stammer out some answers: they’re 
my friends, it’s a fun play. But 
from the way he talked about Yale 
undergraduate theater, I knew 
Mr. Koskoff wouldn’t be so easily 
convinced of my authority. When 
his wife arrived, his monologue 
turned to the play they saw last 
weekend, in the theater in the 
basement of Morse College.


	
“You 
know,” 
Mr. Koskoff, “I’d never seen 
Will Smith [’12] before last 
weekend 
in 
Julius 
Caesar.” 
	
“No,” 
called 
wife from the kitchen, “we’ve 
seen him in lots of things.”


The Koskoffs see plays 
every weekend with the help of 
the website of the Yale Drama 
Coalition, which offers showtimes 
and tickets for all undergraduate 
performances. “I told two or three 
people about it,” said Koskoff of 
the site, “and then thought, no, 
no, if all the AARP people come, 
they’ll have to close the shows 
except to Yale and Yale family. 
So we don’t talk much about it, 
but we bring people—once in a 
while.” They also show guests a 
DVD of the 2009 production of 
Cabaret directed by Kate Berman 
’11, which Mr. Koskoff said he 
obtained 
Berman’s 
mother. It’s a perennial favorite. 
“Everything about it is wonderful,” 
he said. “And Jason Perlman 
[’11] 
plays 
spymaster.”


	
“It’s like going to Yale 
without the papers,” said Mrs. 
Koskoff, who makes a habit of 
seeing undergraduate singing 
performances as well. Mr. Koskoff 
or fifth show is disappointing.”
“That’s 
not 
true,” 
interrupted Mr. Koskoff. “We’re 
often disappointed.” After all, 
his standards are quite high. 
He frequently e-mails student 
directors about their projects, 
often to complain that the 
plays they’ve chosen are too 
depressing. “For some reason, a 
lot of these Yale undergrads like 
these real downers,” he puzzled. 
“Did you see the play with 
Cooper Lewis [’11] a month ago? 
A virtuoso performance,” he said 
of Lewis—but the play, Home 
Free, about an incestuous brother 
and sister, was another downer.


Recently, 
e-mailed Michael Knowles ’12 
to ask about Phantoms Go 
Down, a play by Ariel Sheperd-
Oppenheim ’10, which Knowles 
directed. “What’s the plot line of 
Phantoms?” Mr. Koskoff wrote 
simply. To Knowles’ response, 
Mr. Koskoff wrote: “I am a great 
admirer of Julie Shain’s [’13] and 
also of Jeremy Lloyd [’12], but 
my wife and I are still depressed 
from  Cornered  and  Home Free, 
and as your show sounds like a 
real downer, I’ll probably pass 
on it.” Mr. Koskoff explained that 
he finds it easy to contact Yale 
students because of our formulaic 
e-mail 
addresses. 
Last 
year, 
he e-mailed Elizabeth Sutton-
Stone ’10, who was directing 
a production of Measure for 
Measure, to demand a reason to 
see yet another Shakespeare play.


Knowles’ play was one 
of the shows Mr. Koskoff turned 
down the night I had dinner 
with him. Instead, he chose War 
in Times of Love, a play directed 
by Danielle Tomson ’12, saying 
he always enjoys actors Peter 
Kaufman ’12 and Timmia Feldman
