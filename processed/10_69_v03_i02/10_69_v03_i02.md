**Title: Boys will be boys ...**
**Author:  (unattributed)**
**Page number(s): 2**

Well, it's time to end the war again. As
the first touches of brown begin to burrow
into green leaves, we are all reminded that
time is indeed passing. Sometime,
though no one is sure quite when, after
a quiet spring and lethargic summer, the
secret seeped out. We ended the war
when we marched in April, years ago. We
ended the war when we marched on the
Pentagon. We dumped Johnson and ended
the war. The politics of boredom took
their toll, but as the air cools and darkness comes earlier with each day, as we
realize we are on the edge of winter hibernation, it is time for yet another last
scream to end the war.


But the October 15 war Moratorium
will be different from earlier attempts to
end the war. In the past, war protest was
run by steatping-mad people who called
themselves radicals. This Moratorium is
distinguished by its moderate tone: it is
being run by students who still dream
about being president, or maybe senator,
or, if Yale has taken its toll, about being
an advisor to presidents.


The call is "ecumenical": that the
members of the New Haven community
should all unite in opposition to the war,
forgetting for the moment lesser political
differences. That seems to be a damn good
idea. The name of the game is still politics
-and a moderate war protest may well
amass the greatest base of support.


But there are problems. With the effort
to get prominent community and national leaders to speak against the war, it
is too easy to forget that Richard Nixon
could get up on that platform and state
that he is opposed to the war and thinks
it should be ended as soon as possible.
He's already said that in living color on
prime time. It's too easy to start believing
that the war is some ugly mistake, that
Thieu and Ky are tinhorn dictators, that
all we have to do is "bring the boys home"
and everything will be hunky dory.


The exercise of power changes not
only those who are bombed, but also those
who drop them. The war is not an honest
mistake; it is the result of many complex
forces, many of which we probably do not
yet understand, but which nevertheless
create the reality with which we must
cope. We should march; we must march,
but let's not buy a sophisticated myth of
innocence: we are not going to be the
same as we were, when the war ends, if
it ever ends.


It's about time that prominent community and national leaders took their
stand against the war. But we should be
aware that because they are committed to
the forces that entangled us in the moral
atrocity, they are going to try to make the
war look like an ugly wart to be scraped
off and forgotten. It's no wart, it's a malignant tumor. And it's been on the body
long enough to spread, and spread deep.


**Title: ... Another End**
**Author: Jonathan Lear**

Well, the cultural revolution has finally
hit the east coast. Starting last Sunday
and for every Sunday henceforth, the
Electric Circus announced that it will admit
any girl without a brassiere free. My,
times are changing, and change may be
one of the few things good for its own
sake; and so in keeping with what we
hope will be a growing spirit, The New
Journal is going to effect a small change
of its own.


This is the last issue of the New Journal
that I will edit. Like the Chinese general who becomes a private, it's time to
go back into the ranks. Power, on no
matter how small a scale, is a tough thing
to deal with, and if one stays in a position
too long, he runs the risk of taking himself seriously.


**Title: Jailing a Revolution**
**Author: Charles Draper**
**Page number(s): 3**

You can jail a revolutionary,
but you can't jail a revolution.


Last May 19 on Malcolm X's birthday,
Bobby Seale, the chairman of the Black
Panther Party, arrived in New Haven to
give a speech at Battell Chapel. After the
speech he went to the local Panther headquarters to discuss problems and issues
with the three-month-old New Haven
chapter. The discussion lasted until early
in the morning when Seale left to catch
a plane back to the west coast.


Three months later in Oakland several
cars filled with armed federal agents
forced Seale off the road on his way back
from a wedding. They arrested him for
"unlawful flight to avoid prosecution," a
federal offense. This was surprising because Seale was in no way "fleeing" at the
time: he was openly carrying on his functions at the national Panther headquarters. Moreover, he was unaware of any
prosecution against him. He put up bail
but was arrested again before he got out
of the courthouse, when Connecticut
charges were brought against him on six
counts of murder, kidnapping and conspiracy. These charges will involve him in
what may be one of the most political
trials ever held in America. It begins early
next year in New Haven.


On May 21, a fisherman found the mutilated body of Alex Rackley, a Panther
from New York, in a shallow river near
Middlefield, Connecticut. In the early
morning hours of the 22nd, police
swooped down on Panther headquarters
on Orchard Street and the next morning
the New Haven Register convicted the
eight arrested Panthers with a full banner
of mugshots and all the gory details. Over
the summer seven more Panthers were
picked up as fugitives in various cities
across the country, the latest being Bobby
Seale, who is said to have given the death
order for Rackley when he visited the local headquarters. As evidence the police
say they have a tape which they seized
during the initial arrest that apparently
recorded a torture session in which several
Panthers are said to have identified themselves. The police also have a confession,
which is said to be the basis for the charge
against Seale, from a Panther named
George Sams who was caught burglarizing
a house in Toronto in mid-August.


In order to understand the background
of these events, it is necessary to review
the history of the Panthers on the east
coast last spring. They were in a deep
state of disorder, due largely to the infiltration of many of the chapters by police
agents and informers. Many chapters
were new and unorganized because of the
rapid national expansion of the Panther
Party and were susceptible to the more
subtle methods of police surveillance.


The Panthers were tightening up their
ranks nationally, expelling both possible
agents and possible criminals. Being both
black and radicals, they were becoming
extremely aware of their vulnerability to
repression and were taking pains to remove any justification for the increasing
attacks and harassment by law-enforcement agencies. They wanted it to be clear
that these were acts of political repression
and not the policing of criminals.


In April, twenty-one Panthers were arrested in New York City for allegedly conspiring to blow up a police station, some
downtown department stores and the politically dubious goal of the Bronx Botanical Gardens. For this crime which
never happened, in spite of the "dependable" information that they had intended
to commit it, the Party in New York has
been effectively destroyed with a collective
bail of about two million dollars. Conspiracy had long been used against political
movements and radical labor
unions. It places the burden of proof on
the defendant, despite all guarantees of
his assumed innocence, and ascribes guilt
by association, which can, in a case such
as Reverend Coffin's, include people the
defendant has never met. At any rate, the
indictments tie up leaders in individual
legal defense and effectively hinder their
organizations and their political activities.


As Ronald Steele said in his article on
the Panthers in a recent issue of the New
York Review of Books:


Is it likely that members of a white political
organization, even the Ku Klux Klan, would
be rounded up in the middle of the night,
thrown into jails dispersed around the city,
kept under maximum security and even solitary confinement, detained in prison for
months on exorbitant bail for a crime that
was never committed, and charged with
plotting irrational actions without the liberal
press voicing its indignation? Yet this is
precisely what happened to the New York
twenty-one. If you let it happen to us, the
Panthers are saying to white liberals, it will
happen to anyone who dissents. After the
lessons of Chicago and Berkeley, white radicals, at least are beginning to believe the
Panther contention that we're all niggers
now.


Rory Hithe and Landon Williams came
east from the Bay Chapter to help the
floundering organization in New York.
With them came a Panther of questionable
reputation and of extreme importance to
the forthcoming trial in New Haven: his
name is George Sams. Sams, known as a
street fighter from Detroit, had been expelled from the Party for several offenses
which could not be tolerated, including
raping several Panther sisters and stabbing
a brother during an argument. He was
reinstated in the Party on the personal
request of Stokely Carmichael, who decided later that Sams was a police agent
but was unable, he said, to inform the
Party because his letters were never received at national headquarters. Sams,
Hithe and Williams drove up to check
the New Haven chapter in the middle of
May. The fourth person in the car was
Alex Rackley. According to the police
they turned on Rackley, accused him of
being an agent in the New York bust, held
him hostage for several days at the New
Haven headquarters, tortured him in a
prolonged and painful session and, on the
order of Seale, executed him.


It seems unlikely that a chapter anxious
about infiltration and already subject to
increased police harassment would record
the supposed torture and then kill and so
clumsily dispose of such an obviously
identifiable body. It is also hard to believe
that a chapter which at that time was
spearheading the search for a missing
eleven-year-old black girl, and which was
respected for its tight Panther discipline
and its constructive community action,
would spend its energies glorying in the
savage mutilation of a man and providing
such incriminating evidence for the police.


These alleged actions seem considerably
more likely in the context of the image
which the national media has presented
of the Panthers. They are vilified as shotgun-waving hooligans filled with black
despair and white hatred as well as a
penchant for destruction and crime. This
image has dulled the public consciousness

71 The New Journal! October 12, 1969 
black man sporting 'black capitalism,' 
wearing a dashiki and pulling down 
$15,000 frQm Community Progress Incor-
porated. "The cultural nationalist " ac-
cording to Huey Newton, "doesn't under-
stand the white revolutionaries because 
be can't see why anyone white would turn 
o~ t~e system. So he thinks that maybe 
thiS 1s .some more hypocrisy being planted 
by whtte people." The confiict between 
the Panthers and the cultural nationalists 
came to a head last January on the UCLA 
campus when Ron Karenga's cultural na-
tionalists shot the Panther's Deputy Min-
ister of Information, John Huggins, in 
the back. 

Huggins grew up as a middle-class black 
in ~ew Haven, and, although he was in-
telligent, he was eventually discouraged 
by the discrimination and irrelevance of 
the education he was given. Consequently, 
he droppe~ out of sch.ool to join the Navy. 
Fred HarriS, of the Hill Parents Associa-
tion, said, "I think that the thing that 
really gave him a jolt was when he was 
on an aircraft carrier off the coast of 
V~et~am when the little girls got killed in 
Brrmmgham. He said that really blew his 
mind; he didn't know how to deal with 
it, and he just started to cry. And all the 
time people were giving him orders telling 
him what to do." 

' 
W-orking for the Hill Parents' Associa-
tion after leaving the Navy, Huggins be-
gan to find a real common bond with 
lower-class blacks. In November 1967 he 
went to Los Angeles where he joined the 
B~ack Panther Party. He developed a 
Widespread reputation as an eloquent 
spokesman for the freedom of blacks and 
was famous for the patience and gentle-
ness with which he could make the 
Panther program make sense in the lives 
of everyone he met. As Karenga and the 
cultural nationalists in the Black Student 
Union at UCLA felt more and more 
threatened by Huggins' popularity and 
the .growing appeal of Panther politics, 
they trapped Huggins and the Panther 
poet AI prentice "Bunchy" Carter and 
murdered them both. 

After the killing, Huggins' twenty-one 
year-old widow, Ericka, and their new-
born baby came to live in New Haven. In 
February she began to set up a local chap-
ter of the Panthers. By the middle of May 
they had a small group of very solid 
members and were moving on a number 
of community projects. They held a "free 
Huey" rally in front of the courthouse 
on May first. They were collecting money 
to set up the Breakfast for Children 
Pro&!am, and they held a meeting at the 
Medtcal School to set up a free clinic in 
the ghetto. That meeting was dispersed by 
a bomb scare. The liberation school was 
<?pen and teaching despite heavy police 
surveillance and frequent harassment. 

Ericka Huggins was also instrumental 
on a national scale in raising the position 
of Panther women from the degraded 
position of "Pussy Power" to one of re-
spected equality in the struggle through 
her enthusiasm, energy and sacrifice. 

After her arrest Eldridge Cleaver wrote 
to her in prison : 
Tb.e incarceration and the suffering of Sister 
Encka should be a stinging rebulce to all 
manifestations of ma.le chauvinism within 
our ranks. Because the liberation of women 
is one of the most important issues facing 
the world today. Great efforts have been 
made in various parts of the world to do 
something about this, but I know from my 
own experience that the smouldering and 
the burning flame descending for the libera-
tion of women in Babylon [America] is the 
issue that is going to explode, and if we're not 
careful it is going to destroy our ranks, de-
stroy our organization, because women want 
to be liberated just as all oppressed people 
want to be liberated. 

We have to be careful about that and 
Sister Ericka Huggins is a shining e~ample 
of a revolutionary woman who's meted out 
the same kind of injustice from the pig powe~ 
structure that a revolutionary man receives. 
So the~ didn't put her in a powder puff cell. 
T_hey dtd not make life easy for her. But the 
p1gs recognize a revolutionary woman to be 
as much a threat as a revolutionary man. 
Appaz:ently the Panther women in jail 
are bemg held under worse conditions 
than most of the men. Rose Smith, who is 
expected to give birth to a child in De-
cember, is still forced to live in a prison 
cell. 

The Panthers are scattered throughout 
the state where they have been held with-
out bail and primarily in solitary confine-
ment for over four months. Four of the 
fifteen are in various stages of extradition 
from Denver, Salt Lake City and Detroit. 
Bobby Seale is in Chicago at present, as 
part of the "Conspiracy 8" that was 
accused of conspiring to incite the riots 
that occurred during the Democratic Na-
tional Convention. He spent a total of 
four hours in Chicago during that week 
of documented police riots. 

Seiil~ lack~ the c~arisma and the rap-
port w1th whtte audtences which have 
made both Cleaver and Newton famous, 
but be speaks excellently to blacks and 
is the master organizer of the party. He 
and Huey Newton co-founded the Pan-
th.ers when they both became discouraged 
w1th the Afro-American Society to which 
they belonged at Merrit College. His style 
expresses itself in poems like "Uncle 
Sammy Call Me Fulla Lucifer," which he 
used to recite on street corners in the 
~hetto . ~e tight and effective organiza-
tion of the party on a national scale is due 
largely to his talents and genius as a 
leader. Now, even if he wins his cases 
both in Chicago and New Haven he ~ill 
be incapacitated, as far as the pa:ty is 
concerned, for at least six months. If his 
efforts fail, be may be the victim of the 
destruction of one of the most volatile 
forces for liberation that has ever con-
fronted this country. 

All fifteen Panthers are in jeopardy of 
the death penalty. In Connecticut, mur-
der, being an accessory to murder and 
kidnapping are all capital crimes. The 
trial might begin as early as late Novem-
ber or early December, but it is not likely 
to get started until January or February. 
It may very well be that the New Haven 
case will be the classic trial of the Black 
Panther Party. It will probably demarcate 
the harsh boundaries of our cherished 
freedom of political dissent. The Pan-
thers believe that in early December the 
Party will be declared illegal for being sub-
versive, a result of hearings of Senator 
McClellan's Permanent Subcommittee on 
Investigations which spent most of its 
time listening to police chiefs and ostra-
cized members of the Panther Party. 

Considering the political explosiveness 
of the issues involved, this trial will be a 
severe test of the American legal system. 
Assuming the truth of the Panthers' con-
tention that this is a frame-up which in-
tends to make political repression sound 
like common crime enforcement, we 
must realize that the state has vast re-

BlackPdnthers in Algiers 
by David Matthews Schaffer 


• 
11 I The New Journal! October 12, 1969 
On Tuesday afternoon, July 22, the 
day after the opening of the first Pan-
African Cultural Festival, I was walking 
down mainstreet Algiers for the fourth 
time that day. The one and one-half 
· miles from Festival Information Center, 
126 Rue Didouche Mourad, towards the 
press center just past the Great Post Office 
were becoming country miles. About 
half-way there I passed by the Black 
Panther exposition center where workers 
behind locked glass doors had mysteri-
ously been putting up exhibits for two 
days. It should have been less of a surprise 
when a Festival guide ran up behind me 
to say that the center was finally going 
to open officially. I turned around and 
hurried into the display room filled with 
Emory Douglass revolutionary art and 
Black Panther Party posters. The room 
was only beginning to fill up with people. 
As a crowd entered I walked to the rear 
and found myself facing Eldridge 
Cleaver. 

There was no planned program beyond 
Madame Erve's welcoming speech, stress-
ing that the Panthers had come to the 
Festival to dramatize their solidarity with 
the oppressed people of the world and 
that this "historic link-up" was 
"beautiful." By now the room was packed 
and newsmen were pushing their way 
towards Cleaver. Near him were his 
pregnant wife Kathleen, Ted Joans, 
David Hilliard, the Party's minister of 
culture Ed Bullins, Skip Malone, George 
Black and other Panthers. An impromptu 
press conference began. 

Eldridge Cleaver, minister of informa-
tion for the Black Panther Party, had 
only recently flown to Algiers from 
Havana, where he had been in secret 
self-exile. For nearly two years since skip-
ping bail in California the author of 
Soul on Ice had vanished from public 
sight. It was only towards the end of 
his seclusion, when a reporter from 
Reuters stumbled on to him in Havana, 
that the world found out where Cleaver 
had been in hiding. There was under-
standable excitement among the four or 
five American newsmen in the exposition 
room in Algiers, who would become the 
first of their country's journalists to make 
contact with Cleaver in two ye.ars. 

Eldridge Cleaver was first asked what 
he thought of the moon landing the day 
before. In response, he relied on Ted 
Joans who read his newly composed poem 
describing the event. "Soar Grapes." 
"Into their concept of perfect blue 
they took millions of dollars .. , " began 
Joans. Cleaver himself added that "if the 
moon shot was calculated to help human-
ity it was a dismal failure!' In 
fact he wished that "Tricky Dick had 
been one of the astronauts" and that the 
space capsule had remained on the moon. 

The crowd and the movie lights sur-
rounding Cleaver made the heat in the 
room intolerable. His dashiki was drip-
ping wet, and he seemed alone, sullen 
and somehow trapped-a kind of existen-
tial hero. He was a man without a 
country, and he made no attempt to 
conceal his hostility for the US press and 
government. An American AP reporter 
asked if the Algerian government helped 
finance the Black Panther Party. Eldridge 
blurted, "Identify yourself!" TI:ien he 
followed, "Tell J. Edgar Hoover, Richard 
Nixon and Senator John McClellan 
that Lady Bird Johnson finances the 
Black Panther Party!" Kathleen Cleaver, 
seated beside her husband, showed a cool 
disdain for the American reporters. When 
one of them became intrigued by the 
flamboyant color of her dress, he asked 
shyly, and innocently enough, if it were 
African. "Hell no," she smiled, "It's a 
maternity dress." 

In a later interview Cleaver implied 
that he missed the United States and that 
he might like to go back and face the 
trial for which he had skipped bail. He 
explained that he was not a fugitive from 
j.ustice as he had never been convicted. 
Maintaining that his only crime was 
skipping bail, he said the United States 
didn't want him to stand trial because it 
"knew" he would win. 

The opening press conference left a 
direct discussion of the United States and 
turned to the crisis in the Middle East. 
Cleaver said that the Black Panther Party 
understood the Jews' long tradition of 
suffering. But it distinguished between 
their suffering "and the problems they 
now cause for other people." Thus 
Cleaver expressed the solidarity of his 
party with El Fatah, the Palestinian 
liberation movement. Hilliard summed up 
Panther policy and reopened the indict-
ment of the US by snarling, "Whatever 
the enemy supports we oppose; whatever 
the enemy opposes we support." 

Throughout the Festival, Cleaver 
stated again and again that "culture is 
invalid unless political." It was the theme 
of the entire Festival. The Black 
Panthers incarnated the theme, and it 
was probably why they were even invited 
to Algiers and why the Algerian govern-
ment provided them with the exposition 
center. In addition to the thirty-six African 
nations which attended, the Festival 
committee had invited the Black Panthers, 
El Fatah, the NLF and six African 
nationall.iberation movements: ANC 
(South Africa), MPLA (Angola), 
PAIGC (Guiney Bissau and the Cape 
Verde Islands), Frelimo (Mozambique), 
Swapo (Nambia) and ZAPU (Southern 
Rhodesia) . All these groups used the 
Festival as a forum for their revolutionary 
propaganda. 

Ha-Xuan-Trong, vice minister of cul-
ture of the Democratic Republic of 
Vietnam, addressing a writer's collo-
quiem at the Festival, expressed the soli-
darity of his people with the various 
liberation movements and presented a 
definition expanding Cleaver's criterion 
for cultural validity. 

Culture is a front of struggle, and each cul-
tural worker is a militant. True culture is 
above all humanistic and revolutionary, in 
the sense that it does not delight with the 
comfortable surrogate that the oppressor 
offers it to better incite it to the inaction 
and apathy that serve only his egotistical 
interests. It has to be dynamic and carry in 
it the virtue of exhorting, discovering and 
edifying the humane, the beautiful, the 
useful. 

The North Vietnamese delegation 
headed by Vice Minister Trong later 
visited the Panthers at their center for a 
short while. David Hilliard, after first 
asking for someone among the spectators 
to translate his words into French. stated 
that the two movements were striving 
for a mutual goal, the liberation of their 
oppressed peoples. The two ministers 
then shook hands, as George Black, 
Yale '66, explained that if other move-
ments and governments could have a party 
hierarchy so could the Black Panthers. 
In fact the Panthers could even have a 
foreign service, another reason why they 
h~d come to Algiers. It is this point of 
view, coupled to their cooperation with 
whites, that separates the Black Panthers 
and Stokely Carmichael. 

Cooperation with whites became crucial 
to the Panther's legitimacy, as the oppro-
brium "racist," intrinsic or merely 
attributed, became the Achilles heel of the 
Black Panthers in Algiers. The Black 
Panther Party of today maintains that it 
aims at cooperation with white radicals, 
though it may have begun as a racist 
organization. When Stokely Carmichael, 
who still clings to black racism, flew to 
the Festival, he viciously attacked the 
Panther's claim. When Stokely first 
ambled down the streets of Algiers, he 
did not attract attention. To the few, 
there was the recognizable lean, mad 
look. At the Festival his racist philosophy 
drf!w little support, while it did foster 
among whites even more suspicion of the 
Panthers, who are seeking their coopera-
tion. He was bellicose, cantankerous and 
more dogmatic than usual in maintaining 
that the Panthers had "betrayed" black 
men everywhere. Stokely had flown to 
the Festival late as a kind of self-appointed 
delegate, stayed at the Georges V, the best 
hotel in town, and returned to Guinea 
where he was .reportedly learning French 
with his new wife, Miriam Makeba. 

Algerians had filled the Panther center, 
even if cautiously, to meet Cleaver, but 
they, and the Panthers, avoid Carmichael. 
In the Tuesday conference, Cleaver him-
self dismissed Stokely with a quip about 
the split between the Panthers and 
Carrnichael-''We meet with Stokely only 
when we run into him." On several 
occasions Cleaver also felt obligated 
to hold special conferences to explain 
the non-racist policy of his party. These 
meetings usually ended as shouting 
matches with doubting Algerians. But 
try as they did to convince Algerians 
of their non-racism, the Panthers didn't 
succeed, because of an ironic and tragic 
fault not of their own making. 

If the Festival revealed anything about 
the personality of the African continent . 
it demonstrated once and for all the deep 
racial prejudice between generally white 
Arab North Africa and black Africa to 
the south. Algerians taunted members of a 
black cultural delegation with "Salut 
Negre." A black African would retort, 
"Salut Arabe." In short, many Algerians 
seemed to dislike Negroes more than 
Jews. The Black Panthers were popular 
at the Festival often solely because they 
were professed revolutionaries. They were 
suspected on two rather incompatible 
counts-because they couldn't shake their 
former racist image, and more simply, 
because they were black. 

This suspicion and distrust OR the part 
of the Algerians was countered by the 
fraternity with the black African Libera-
tion Movements. At a dinner Denis 
Brutus, of the African National Congress, 
a South African poet in exile, expressed 
fear for Rhodesia, Australia and the 
United States as a result of the infectious 
appeal of apartheid, and casually dropped, 
"I hope that when the USA pulls out of 
Vietnam it'll have a few extra B52's for 
sale. By this time the only way to get rid 
of apartheid is to blow it out." Sirens, 
Knuclcles and Boots is the poet's label for 
his country's racial segregation and the 
title for his own book of poetry which 
includes "Nightsong City": 

Sleep welJ, my love, sleep welJ: 
The harbor lights glaze over restless docks; 
Police cars cockroach through the tunnel 
streets; 
From the shanties creakiilg iron-sheets 
Violence is tossed like a bug-infested rag 
And fear is imminent as sound in the wind-
swung bell; 
The day's long anger pants from sand and 
rocks; 
but for this breathing night at least, 
my land, my love, sleep well. 

The poet also poses a question that 
faces the Panthers. As they popu-
larize their movement with white radicals 
and become even more of a political 
threat to the government, will repression 
be initiated to end the party itself? More 
than a few feel this has already begun. 

The Black Panther center at the 
Festival was a constant curiosity. But 
oddly it was Algerian students, and not 
black Africans visiting Algiers, who 
flocked there all day every day. Even in 
the evenings after the center's glass door 
were once again locked, one would see a 
group of them looking through the glass 
at Eldridge Cleaver, standing in the 
camera lights of the European press. At 
the close of that memorable press con-
ference of early Tuesday afternoon, 
George Black hastily gathered a pile of 
Emory Douglass posters which ambiti-
ously proclaimed, "Solidarity with the 
Oppressed Peoples of the World" and 
carried them outside in front of the 
Panther center. He climbed on a car and 
began distributing them to the out-
stretched hands of the Algerian students 
who were swarming around him. All of ~ 
sudden, as if possessed with the dream 
of every revolution ever made or begun, 
they began chanting again and again, in a 
roar that must have been heard down 
mainstreet Algiers all the way from 126 
Rue Didouche Mourad to just past the 
Great Post Office, "Le pouvoir 
aupeuple."e

121 The New Journal I October 12,1969 
Could it be that the force of erotic 
dreaming in our society is even stronger 
than that of public relations? Unbeliev-
able, but so it seemed the night of the 
world premiere of Butch Cassidy and The 
Sundance Kid, with College Street muffled 
up tigl;lt in the red tape, ticker tape of 
publicity (a searchlight that must have 
knocked on the windows from Strathcona 
to the Yale-New Haven Hospital, the 
Yale Band, the fuzz, saw horses blocking 
off the street, radio announcements, TV 
cameras, the Taft Hotel, drooling life 
from every window and on and on)-one 
might have thought that only a C. B. De 
Mille, paying twenty-five dollars a day to 
extras and bullying them through mega-
phones, could have hopped up such an 
inconceivably roaring crowd. And yet 
no; in this case the Newmena outdistanced 
even the extraordinary squirreling PR 
phenomena, and one felt that if Paul 
Newman had come unannounced to the 
corner of College and Crown, only for 
five minutes, to pick his nose, that the 
effect would have been quite the same. 

Oh sure, there were probably about 
four people there with enough distance 
from it all to whisper "masscult, masscult" 
under their breath, but for the most part 
the crowd, consisting of panters and 
droolers, many of them men (is Paul 
le /avori pin-up of the Mattachine Society 
we began to wonder?) and lots of them 
perfectly middle-aged, was utterly lost 
and gonesville under the oceanic smash 
of passion. 

It was a crowd you could get pregnant 
in, just by the accident of proximity, and 
at any time one was ripe for the very 
fainting from asphyxiation if not from 
that psychosomatic thing that buckles 
fans at such moments; but one was saved 
time and time again by the rumor that 
this car just now nosing ominously 
through the crowds compliments of the 
police was IT!-the crowd would repeat-
edly arch up (one man in particular 
kept on groaning "ooh, ooh" in a despe-
rate voice) only to crash down on a 
decoy car full of simply no one. Was 
the old slyboots maybe concealed in the 
trunk? 

After knifing your way inside with 
long, menacing tickets (costing five 
dollars, or twenty-five dollars, or fifty 
dollars), there you saw a black tie replica? 
tion of the scene outside; this was one 
time when privilege didn't elevate you to 
the cool jaded heights of anything, it just 
meant that the dress that got ripped 
here was long and silk and ex.pensive. 

The lobby was full of valid grown-
ups like the Robert Liftons and C. Vann 
Woodward, but the fan-mag fever of 
the event made the whisper of his name 
seem like a great "aaaaapril fool" that 
deflated the two-second belief that it was 
actually Joanne, the little woman behind 
the blue eyes. Photographers kept on 
bending back like trampled friends, in a 
Fellini dreamy nightmare of clicking-
but whom?-it was worse than the Oscars 
for maddening little gray men who do 
all tbe work, but, alas, don't got what 
Paul's got. 

Some usherette, as if put there by 
conscience to punish the crowds for their 
fantasies, and who kept on saying crossly, 
"Look I really mean it, will you get the 
hell over there, move!!"-was the last 
raging voice one heard before two ex-
tremely sweaty and cross-looking people

appeared (Joanne Woodward and Paul 
Newman), snapping their heads this way 
and that as if looking in panic and rage 
for the exit in a fire. There was none 
of this darling, darling Janis, forever and 
ever yours. Bobby Vinton stuff in his 
demeanor-indeed he looked like the first 
person laboring under the influence of 
normalcy one had seen in the last thirty 
minutes. Here he was being thrown Ego-
Dog-Yummies by thousands of people, 
and being swaddled by a love that our 
mothers and our math teachers warned 
us never to expect from life-and yet here 
be was in the middle of it, preserving 
his mental health in a cocoon of fed-up 
maturity. It was most admirable, and if 
anyone was looking for something new 
in him to admire, there it was. Also one 
noticed that, after a lifetime of looming 
larger than life on the screen, that he 
looked rather smaller than life in life, that 
he was chewing gum or perhaps some 
gangster toothpick, that he had this orange 
thing around his neck, and that despite 
his crises of ontology and identity on 
movie marquees (Paul Newman IS Hud, 
Paul Newman IS Harper, Paul Newman 
IS the Hustler) that after aU he seemed 
to be rather Himself. 


After that, the most consciously con-
sumed person to come in-hey! and the 
little egomaniac isn't even in the movie-
was Barbra Streisand (yes, but she turns 
out to have formed a company for pro-
ducing movies with Poitier and Newman 
"to beat down some of the old Hollywood 
dinosaurs" as he explained it). Some 
of us who know and love her for her 
work were forced to admit that she is 
probably the most photogenic person on 
earth, given how much she looked like 
cause for teenage tears in Brooklyn 
bathroom mirrors in the flesh. In photo-
graphs what there is of the belle-/aide in 
her achieves a crazy style-but in real life 
her mouth wanders all over her face like 
a huge snake trying to get comfortable 
in a small bathtu~e sort of mouth 
Seventeen wants you to minimize by 
outlining weU inside the borders-and that 
remarkable nose seems like some un-
checked Co-op City growing disastrously 
in the middle of her face. And yet we 
absorbed this shock, grateful that looks 
weren't everything, Paul. 


After Newman and his entourage sat 
down, the brazen hordes stood stock still 
in the aisles, sinning already with him in 
their hearts and staring at him as delib-
erately as if he were the bottom line in 
an eye chart-and the usherette had her 
work cut out for her for another fifteen 
minutes, slicing hopelessly through 
the crowds with her hoarse voice. 


Yes, all right, but apart from mass 
sexual hysteria what was it that brought 
all these people so expensively and de-
votedly here? Something serious but 
swinging called the Yale Film Associates, 
with a board full of heavies and groovies, 
which is here to "support and encourage 
the study of film at Yale ... " for anyone 
" .. who believes that film is a significant 
and relevant subject for study .... " YFA, 
perhaps sensing a Bonnie-and-Clyde type 
mythic-landmark-of-the-screen whiff in 
the air, and capitalizing on the fact that 
both director George Roy Hill and Paul 
Newman were at Yale in some form (the 
latter a drop-out from the drama school 
but obviously of prodigal proportions), de-
cided to bunch itself through the medium 
of this benefit world premiere of Butch 
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and to give 
suckers, the rich and the star-mad, a 
chance to disguise themselves in the 
loftier category of lovers of art. And to 
add to the "big-firsts" of the evening, 
it was also the first major movie premiere 
ever held in New Haven. 


There was a lot of underlying reverence 
and seriousness and big guns rivalling 
the easy attraction of Newman. One was 
made to feel that beyond everything 
visible and big going on, that there lay 
something bigger (that same way Vogue 
has of bullying you into thinking about 
Vidal Sassoon, "There's more at stake 
here than just hair"). One could even 
begin with PN's presence as the smallest 
thing going on, and ascend by steps to 
the movie, the seminar the next day 
about the movie, the seriousness given 
to even the light aspects of the film by 
having them discussed by a panel con-
sisting of the stars, the director, the 
writer, Standish Lawder, etc., the movie 
made about the making of the movie, the 
Yale Film Associates with its impressive 
roster of names, the Art of Film-and also 
still feel that the ghost of the McCarthy 
Campaign was hovering about in the air 
somewhere, too. 


The presentation was finally tugged 
back into, as McLuhan would say, a 
"linear" context. Spencer Berger, the 
president of the YFA, stood up there 
behind a podium bravely talking on in the 
method of schoolteachers, until the fren-
zied crowds heard that he was talking 
and eventually left their vigil in the 
aisles, and sat down and shut up. There 
was something wonderfully polite and 
superfluous about "extending a warm 
welcome" to this man who we'd practically 
winepressed out of existence, but it re-
minded us of a world of rationality behind 
it all. 


Newman was to say the next day at the 
seminar, in response to something adula-
tory that had been said of him, "what he's 
trying to say is that the campus drunk 
f'mally made it." The air was thick with 
that sprt of myth that night (the line of 
privilege and talent and hot fortune forms 
on the right); people were being taken 
seriously and having fun at the same 
time, and they were somehow getting 
away with stuff on a large scale. The 
Yale Film Associates were blasting off 
with panache, certainly without stuffiness. 
William ("Boys and Girls Together," 
"Harper") Goldman's screenplay was 
being talked about at the seminar as 
groovy innovation, loose and free and 
anachronistie-and scenes and themes in 
George Roy Hill's direction were talked 
about at the seminar in a way that made 
us feel that we'd gotten even more for 
our money ... that was no movie, that 
was our homework. 


Butch Cassidy is the latest approach to 
the idea of hating westerns in general but 
liking this one right here a lot. Where 
your basic western (and even sometimes 
your basic antiwestern) tends to be bor-
ingly ballsy and afraid of displaying vul-
nerability especially in men, B.C. is full 
of cool or nervous little crimes (they rob a 
bank in Bolivia by reading their threats 
from a phrase book), awe of the other 
guys, self-doubt, remorse about killing, 
and even fear of the sort of stunts that 
westerns are made of (Redford tries to 
get out of jumping off a cliff into a fierce 
river because, as he finally confesses, he• 
can't swim). It is also elevated above 
the average by its similarity to Jules and 
Jim, because of the friendship between the 
two men and the lyrical presence of the 
girl shared emotionally, if not physically, 
between them. During the showing of the 
movie, PN took it upon himself several 
times to go "shhhh" in his role of the 
responsible member of the group sur-
rounded by lunacy, and finally about 
fifteen minutes before the end he, Robert 
Redford, Joanne Woodward and Barbra 
Streisand, flanked by the ubiquitous pro-
tectors, shot out a side entrance and 
went off to a party being given at Mory's. 


That party (although it looked like a 
whorehouse raid from outside, what with 
the cop cars) represented some kind of 
upward mobility in fandom. Yes, the 
windows were blacked out with bodies 
standing outside on the ledges and looking 
in, and yes, Paul Newman sat at the end 
of a long table next to Barbra and a few 
other insiders and was watched again as 
if he were the corpse in Dr. Tulpe's 
anatomy lesson-but at last the crowd had 
thinned itself out and refined itself 
(through tight invitations and bouncing) 
down to the people who realized how 
you possibly tell Paul Newman about 
how non-negotiable fan passion is. What 
can you possibly tell Paul Newman about 
himself thai he hasn't gathered through 
the evidence of his senses already? Here 
the crowd had, in some little way, grown 
up. Some of it may have been the com-
passionate looking away into the shrimp 
dish of people who have to put up with 
being stared at themselves. Some of it, 
inevitably, was just the bad luck of not 
fitting into the room where Himself was 
sitting. 


And yet, despite the relative elegance 
and discretion of the starers, there they 
were, interrupting their own conversations 
with jerky eye jumps over to Newman's 
chair, grilling his every casual act, and 
studying each turn of the head for new 
information on his profile. When he 
cocked his head toward the Whiffenpoofs 
with a roguish, gallant, "get-this-boys!" 
gesture as they sang a song from his 
movie to h~veryone watched. When 
Barbra pulled out her long hands which 
appear to begin just south of the elbow 
to clap at someone else's singing-we 
watched. It was too hard to believe that 
these people who are paid to fake laughs 
and smiles and tears and looks of doe-like 
surprise can have such a thing as a real 
life. It was easier to imagine that we were 
just watching him in the performance of 
apparently (but not really) spontaneous 
acts, and to posit an offstage voice saying 
"OK, now Paul, as naturally as you can, 
· pick up a match. Now sip some beer. 
Now lower your head and lift up your 
eyebrows-slowly, slowly-that's it." 


When you're in that racket, all the world's 
a screen test.

Revolution 
continued from page 7 
sources which could be used to make the 
charges appear exceedingly plausible. 
The news coverage of the case has been 
very slanted and prejudicial, and the pub-
lic consciousness has not been awakened 
to the injustice of their present situation. 
Many of the Panthers' rights were 
abridged during the arrest and the subse-
quent imprisonment. The police didn't 
have a warrant when they smashed into 
the headquarters and most of their evi-
dence, including the now legendary tape, 
was seized illegally. They were denied 
access to an attorney both the night of the 
arrest and sometime afterward, and no 


bail was ever set for their release. Neither 
the defendants nor their attorney were 
notified of the grand jury proceedings, 
nor were they represented at the inquest, 
which determines cause of death in the 
victim. They were denied a preliminary 
hearing and were indicted by the grand 
jury, the weapon of the prosecution, 
which met in secret. The "felons" are kept 
in solitary confinement for the most part 
and dispersed to prisons throughout the 
state. In a conspiracy trial it is extremely 
useful to isolate the defendants, especially 
the young ones, in order to gain contra-
dictory and incriminating testimony. 


One of the points of the defense will 
be the constituency of the jury and the 
process of selecting it. Point nine of the 
Panther program states "We want all black 
people when brought to trial to be tried 
in court by a jury of their peers or people 
from the black communities, as defined by 
the Constitution of the United States." 
This is intended to dispell the hoax that 
"all Americans are equal" whch allows, 
for instance, the crimes of a broken, old 
black man to be tried by ten middle class 
white businessmen, one woman and a 
token black from the bourgeoisie. A New 
Haven attorney recently stated that he 
was unable to remember ever seeing any 
black man in a New Haven jury. To com-
bat the inherent racism of the jurors at 
Huey Newtons' trial, Dr. Robert Blauner, 
from the University of California, a spe-
cialist in racism, presented this four-point 
yardstick: 


The juror, he said, should know something 
about black history and culture; be should be 
aware of his own racism and be working 
to overcome it; be should have lived a life 
more equalitarian than segregated-one 
which includes experience with blacks and 
other minority people; and be should be ac-
tively concerned with changing the racist 
structure of his society, not in his spare 
time, but in his daily life. 


Gene Marine. The Black Panthers. 
The Panthers say, "We have been, and 
are being tried by aU-white juries that 
have no understanding of the average 
reasoning man of the black communty." 
Needless to say, neither the all-black jury 
nor the racially self-conscious jury were 
accepted as models for the jury in Oak-
land, nor will they be in New Haven. 
But the questions must be raised. 


Another part of the defense will deal 
with the prejudicing of the case that is 
part of the hysteria generated by the in-
flammatory articles and impressions 
given by the national media, and par-
ticularly by New Raven's own blind spot, 
The New Haven Register. Evidence has 
been introduced and conclusions have 
been made in the Register, as a result of 
possibly intentional news leaks from po-
lice sources, which should only be maae 
public during the trial. The presumption 
of innocence which is necessary to every 
fair trial, the defense feels, is impossible 
because every newspaper reader in the 
New Haven area "knows" the incontro-
vertible "facts" about the case. 


The Panthers can be expected to push 
their politics in relation to this trial. As a 
response to what they feel to be a con-
certed effort to destroy their organization 
by the government of this country, the 
Panthers are going to build their move-
ment. They are involved in a vivid demon-
stration of the failures of the system that 
they are trying to destroy. They propose 
to show the huge injustice and inequality 
of the society in which we Jive by laying 
their lives on the line and by encouraging 
others to "join them in a conspiracy to 
make a world in which people have con-
trol over their lives." It is necessary to 
discern the forces that control judgment 
and to interpret the facts of this case be-
cause of the huge political implications 
involved. 


"It's not an overstatement to say that 
the destiny of the entire human race de-
pends on the outcome of what is going 
on in America today .... and the most 
serious question before the American peo-
ple is who now, in this post civil-rights era, 
are the true patriots, the new right or the 
new left?" said Eldridge Cleaver in Soul 
on lee. Depending on your viewpoint, the 
Black Panther Party, as a manifestation of 
the heightened consciousness of the 
awakening black masses, poses the most 
serious threat or the brightest hope in this 
country today.lt is therefore vitally impor-
tant, if we still make claim to be a just so-
ciety, to ascertain whether they are on trial 
for their alleged crimes or for their politi-
cal beliefs. The Panthers have established 
camp in that precarious area of the politi-
cal spectrum where they find the needs of 
the people in conflict with the interests of 
the government and the status quo. We 
held such positions as the vanguard of 
freedom in countries of Eastern Europe 
and pride ourselves on our latitude of 
political stance in this country. It is neces-
sary to guard that freedom both for our-
selves and for others if this society is ever 
to remain flexible and responsive to our 
needs. Cleaver is right when he says "If we 
can't walk down the street in security, you 
can't walk down the street in security."
