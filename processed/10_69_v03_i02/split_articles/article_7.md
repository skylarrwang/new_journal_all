black man sporting 'black capitalism,'

$15,000 frQm Community Progress Incor-
porated. "The cultural nationalist " ac-
cording to Huey Newton, "doesn't under-
stand the white revolutionaries because 
be can't see why anyone white would turn 
o~ t~e system. So he thinks that maybe 
thiS 1s .some more hypocrisy being planted 
by whtte people." The confiict between 
the Panthers and the cultural nationalists 
came to a head last January on the UCLA 
campus when Ron Karenga's cultural na-
tionalists shot the Panther's Deputy Min-
ister of Information, John Huggins, in 
the back. 

Huggins grew up as a middle-class black 
in ~ew Haven, and, although he was in-
telligent, he was eventually discouraged 
by the discrimination and irrelevance of 
the education he was given. Consequently, 
he droppe~ out of sch.ool to join the Navy. 
Fred HarriS, of the Hill Parents Associa-
tion, said, "I think that the thing that 
really gave him a jolt was when he was 
on an aircraft carrier off the coast of 
V~et~am when the little girls got killed in 
Brrmmgham. He said that really blew his 
mind; he didn't know how to deal with 
it, and he just started to cry. And all the 
time people were giving him orders telling 
him what to do." 

' 
W-orking for the Hill Parents' Associa-
tion after leaving the Navy, Huggins be-
gan to find a real common bond with 
lower-class blacks. In November 1967 he 
went to Los Angeles where he joined the 
B~ack Panther Party. He developed a 
Widespread reputation as an eloquent 
spokesman for the freedom of blacks and 
was famous for the patience and gentle-
ness with which he could make the 
Panther program make sense in the lives 
of everyone he met. As Karenga and the 
cultural nationalists in the Black Student 
Union at UCLA felt more and more 
threatened by Huggins' popularity and 
the .growing appeal of Panther politics, 
they trapped Huggins and the Panther 
poet AI prentice "Bunchy" Carter and 
murdered them both. 

After the killing, Huggins' twenty-one 
year-old widow, Ericka, and their new-
born baby came to live in New Haven. In 
February she began to set up a local chap-
ter of the Panthers. By the middle of May 
they had a small group of very solid 
members and were moving on a number 
of community projects. They held a "free 
Huey" rally in front of the courthouse 
on May first. They were collecting money 
to set up the Breakfast for Children 
Pro&!am, and they held a meeting at the 
Medtcal School to set up a free clinic in 
the ghetto. That meeting was dispersed by 
a bomb scare. The liberation school was 
<?pen and teaching despite heavy police 
surveillance and frequent harassment. 

Ericka Huggins was also instrumental 
on a national scale in raising the position 
of Panther women from the degraded 
position of "Pussy Power" to one of re-
spected equality in the struggle through 
her enthusiasm, energy and sacrifice. 

After her arrest Eldridge Cleaver wrote 
to her in prison : 
Tb.e incarceration and the suffering of Sister 
Encka should be a stinging rebulce to all 
manifestations of ma.le chauvinism within 
our ranks. Because the liberation of women 
is one of the most important issues facing 
the world today. Great efforts have been 
made in various parts of the world to do 
something about this, but I know from my 
own experience that the smouldering and 
the burning flame descending for the libera-
tion of women in Babylon [America] is the 
issue that is going to explode, and if we're not 
careful it is going to destroy our ranks, de-
stroy our organization, because women want 
to be liberated just as all oppressed people 
want to be liberated. 

We have to be careful about that and 
Sister Ericka Huggins is a shining e~ample 
of a revolutionary woman who's meted out 
the same kind of injustice from the pig powe~ 
structure that a revolutionary man receives. 
So the~ didn't put her in a powder puff cell. 
T_hey dtd not make life easy for her. But the 
p1gs recognize a revolutionary woman to be 
as much a threat as a revolutionary man. 
Appaz:ently the Panther women in jail 
are bemg held under worse conditions 
than most of the men. Rose Smith, who is 
expected to give birth to a child in De-
cember, is still forced to live in a prison 
cell. 

The Panthers are scattered throughout 
the state where they have been held with-
out bail and primarily in solitary confine-
ment for over four months. Four of the 
fifteen are in various stages of extradition 
from Denver, Salt Lake City and Detroit. 
Bobby Seale is in Chicago at present, as 
part of the "Conspiracy 8" that was 
accused of conspiring to incite the riots 
that occurred during the Democratic Na-
tional Convention. He spent a total of 
four hours in Chicago during that week 
of documented police riots. 

Seiil~ lack~ the c~arisma and the rap-
port w1th whtte audtences which have 
made both Cleaver and Newton famous, 
but be speaks excellently to blacks and 
is the master organizer of the party. He 
and Huey Newton co-founded the Pan-
th.ers when they both became discouraged 
w1th the Afro-American Society to which 
they belonged at Merrit College. His style 
expresses itself in poems like "Uncle 
Sammy Call Me Fulla Lucifer," which he 
used to recite on street corners in the 
~hetto . ~e tight and effective organiza-
tion of the party on a national scale is due 
largely to his talents and genius as a 
leader. Now, even if he wins his cases 
both in Chicago and New Haven he ~ill 
be incapacitated, as far as the pa:ty is 
concerned, for at least six months. If his 
efforts fail, be may be the victim of the 
destruction of one of the most volatile 
forces for liberation that has ever con-
fronted this country. 

All fifteen Panthers are in jeopardy of 
the death penalty. In Connecticut, mur-
der, being an accessory to murder and 
kidnapping are all capital crimes. The 
trial might begin as early as late Novem-
ber or early December, but it is not likely 
to get started until January or February. 
It may very well be that the New Haven 
case will be the classic trial of the Black 
Panther Party. It will probably demarcate 
the harsh boundaries of our cherished 
freedom of political dissent. The Pan-
thers believe that in early December the 
Party will be declared illegal for being sub-
versive, a result of hearings of Senator 
McClellan's Permanent Subcommittee on 
Investigations which spent most of its 
time listening to police chiefs and ostra-
cized members of the Panther Party. 

Considering the political explosiveness 
of the issues involved, this trial will be a 
severe test of the American legal system. 
Assuming the truth of the Panthers' con-
tention that this is a frame-up which in-
tends to make political repression sound 
like common crime enforcement, we 
must realize that the state has vast re-
