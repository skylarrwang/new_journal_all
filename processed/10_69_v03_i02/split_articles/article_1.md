Well, it's time to end the war again. As
the first touches of brown begin to burrow
into green leaves, we are all reminded that
time is indeed passing. Sometime,
though no one is sure quite when, after
a quiet spring and lethargic summer, the
secret seeped out. We ended the war
when we marched in April, years ago. We
ended the war when we marched on the
Pentagon. We dumped Johnson and ended
the war. The politics of boredom took
their toll, but as the air cools and darkness comes earlier with each day, as we
realize we are on the edge of winter hibernation, it is time for yet another last
scream to end the war.


But the October 15 war Moratorium
will be different from earlier attempts to
end the war. In the past, war protest was
run by steatping-mad people who called
themselves radicals. This Moratorium is
distinguished by its moderate tone: it is
being run by students who still dream
about being president, or maybe senator,
or, if Yale has taken its toll, about being
an advisor to presidents.


The call is "ecumenical": that the
members of the New Haven community
should all unite in opposition to the war,
forgetting for the moment lesser political
differences. That seems to be a damn good
idea. The name of the game is still politics
-and a moderate war protest may well
amass the greatest base of support.


But there are problems. With the effort
to get prominent community and national leaders to speak against the war, it
is too easy to forget that Richard Nixon
could get up on that platform and state
that he is opposed to the war and thinks
it should be ended as soon as possible.
He's already said that in living color on
prime time. It's too easy to start believing
that the war is some ugly mistake, that
Thieu and Ky are tinhorn dictators, that
all we have to do is "bring the boys home"
and everything will be hunky dory.


The exercise of power changes not
only those who are bombed, but also those
who drop them. The war is not an honest
mistake; it is the result of many complex
forces, many of which we probably do not
yet understand, but which nevertheless
create the reality with which we must
cope. We should march; we must march,
but let's not buy a sophisticated myth of
innocence: we are not going to be the
same as we were, when the war ends, if
it ever ends.


It's about time that prominent community and national leaders took their
stand against the war. But we should be
aware that because they are committed to
the forces that entangled us in the moral
atrocity, they are going to try to make the
war look like an ugly wart to be scraped
off and forgotten. It's no wart, it's a malignant tumor. And it's been on the body
long enough to spread, and spread deep.


**Title: ... Another End**
**Author: Jonathan Lear**

Well, the cultural revolution has finally
hit the east coast. Starting last Sunday
and for every Sunday henceforth, the
Electric Circus announced that it will admit
any girl without a brassiere free. My,
times are changing, and change may be
one of the few things good for its own
sake; and so in keeping with what we
hope will be a growing spirit, The New
Journal is going to effect a small change
of its own.


This is the last issue of the New Journal
that I will edit. Like the Chinese general who becomes a private, it's time to
go back into the ranks. Power, on no
matter how small a scale, is a tough thing
to deal with, and if one stays in a position
too long, he runs the risk of taking himself seriously.
