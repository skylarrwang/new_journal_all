**Title: Jailing a Revolution**

You can jail a revolutionary,
but you can't jail a revolution.


Last May 19 on Malcolm X's birthday,
Bobby Seale, the chairman of the Black
Panther Party, arrived in New Haven to
give a speech at Battell Chapel. After the
speech he went to the local Panther headquarters to discuss problems and issues
with the three-month-old New Haven
chapter. The discussion lasted until early
in the morning when Seale left to catch
a plane back to the west coast.


Three months later in Oakland several
cars filled with armed federal agents
forced Seale off the road on his way back
from a wedding. They arrested him for
"unlawful flight to avoid prosecution," a
federal offense. This was surprising because Seale was in no way "fleeing" at the
time: he was openly carrying on his functions at the national Panther headquarters. Moreover, he was unaware of any
prosecution against him. He put up bail
but was arrested again before he got out
of the courthouse, when Connecticut
charges were brought against him on six
counts of murder, kidnapping and conspiracy. These charges will involve him in
what may be one of the most political
trials ever held in America. It begins early
next year in New Haven.


On May 21, a fisherman found the mutilated body of Alex Rackley, a Panther
from New York, in a shallow river near
Middlefield, Connecticut. In the early
morning hours of the 22nd, police
swooped down on Panther headquarters
on Orchard Street and the next morning
the New Haven Register convicted the
eight arrested Panthers with a full banner
of mugshots and all the gory details. Over
the summer seven more Panthers were
picked up as fugitives in various cities
across the country, the latest being Bobby
Seale, who is said to have given the death
order for Rackley when he visited the local headquarters. As evidence the police
say they have a tape which they seized
during the initial arrest that apparently
recorded a torture session in which several
Panthers are said to have identified themselves. The police also have a confession,
which is said to be the basis for the charge
against Seale, from a Panther named
George Sams who was caught burglarizing
a house in Toronto in mid-August.


In order to understand the background
of these events, it is necessary to review
the history of the Panthers on the east
coast last spring. They were in a deep
state of disorder, due largely to the infiltration of many of the chapters by police
agents and informers. Many chapters
were new and unorganized because of the
rapid national expansion of the Panther
Party and were susceptible to the more
subtle methods of police surveillance.


The Panthers were tightening up their
ranks nationally, expelling both possible
agents and possible criminals. Being both
black and radicals, they were becoming
extremely aware of their vulnerability to
repression and were taking pains to remove any justification for the increasing
attacks and harassment by law-enforcement agencies. They wanted it to be clear
that these were acts of political repression
and not the policing of criminals.


In April, twenty-one Panthers were arrested in New York City for allegedly conspiring to blow up a police station, some
downtown department stores and the politically dubious goal of the Bronx Botanical Gardens. For this crime which
never happened, in spite of the "dependable" information that they had intended
to commit it, the Party in New York has
been effectively destroyed with a collective
bail of about two million dollars. Conspiracy had long been used against political
movements and radical labor
unions. It places the burden of proof on
the defendant, despite all guarantees of
his assumed innocence, and ascribes guilt
by association, which can, in a case such
as Reverend Coffin's, include people the
defendant has never met. At any rate, the
indictments tie up leaders in individual
legal defense and effectively hinder their
organizations and their political activities.


As Ronald Steele said in his article on
the Panthers in a recent issue of the New
York Review of Books:


Is it likely that members of a white political
organization, even the Ku Klux Klan, would
be rounded up in the middle of the night,
thrown into jails dispersed around the city,
kept under maximum security and even solitary confinement, detained in prison for
months on exorbitant bail for a crime that
was never committed, and charged with
plotting irrational actions without the liberal
press voicing its indignation? Yet this is
precisely what happened to the New York
twenty-one. If you let it happen to us, the
Panthers are saying to white liberals, it will
happen to anyone who dissents. After the
lessons of Chicago and Berkeley, white radicals, at least are beginning to believe the
Panther contention that we're all niggers
now.


Rory Hithe and Landon Williams came
east from the Bay Chapter to help the
floundering organization in New York.
With them came a Panther of questionable
reputation and of extreme importance to
the forthcoming trial in New Haven: his
name is George Sams. Sams, known as a
street fighter from Detroit, had been expelled from the Party for several offenses
which could not be tolerated, including
raping several Panther sisters and stabbing
a brother during an argument. He was
reinstated in the Party on the personal
request of Stokely Carmichael, who decided later that Sams was a police agent
but was unable, he said, to inform the
Party because his letters were never received at national headquarters. Sams,
Hithe and Williams drove up to check
the New Haven chapter in the middle of
May. The fourth person in the car was
Alex Rackley. According to the police
they turned on Rackley, accused him of
being an agent in the New York bust, held
him hostage for several days at the New
Haven headquarters, tortured him in a
prolonged and painful session and, on the
order of Seale, executed him.


It seems unlikely that a chapter anxious
about infiltration and already subject to
increased police harassment would record
the supposed torture and then kill and so
clumsily dispose of such an obviously
identifiable body. It is also hard to believe
that a chapter which at that time was
spearheading the search for a missing
eleven-year-old black girl, and which was
respected for its tight Panther discipline
and its constructive community action,
would spend its energies glorying in the
savage mutilation of a man and providing
such incriminating evidence for the police.


These alleged actions seem considerably
more likely in the context of the image
which the national media has presented
of the Panthers. They are vilified as shotgun-waving hooligans filled with black
despair and white hatred as well as a
penchant for destruction and crime. This
image has dulled the public consciousness
