Could it be that the force of erotic 
dreaming in our society is even stronger 
than that of public relations? Unbeliev-
able, but so it seemed the night of the 
world premiere of Butch Cassidy and The 
Sundance Kid, with College Street muffled 
up tigl;lt in the red tape, ticker tape of 
publicity (a searchlight that must have 
knocked on the windows from Strathcona 
to the Yale-New Haven Hospital, the 
Yale Band, the fuzz, saw horses blocking 
off the street, radio announcements, TV 
cameras, the Taft Hotel, drooling life 
from every window and on and on)-one 
might have thought that only a C. B. De 
Mille, paying twenty-five dollars a day to 
extras and bullying them through mega-
phones, could have hopped up such an 
inconceivably roaring crowd. And yet 
no; in this case the Newmena outdistanced 
even the extraordinary squirreling PR 
phenomena, and one felt that if Paul 
Newman had come unannounced to the 
corner of College and Crown, only for 
five minutes, to pick his nose, that the 
effect would have been quite the same. 

Oh sure, there were probably about 
four people there with enough distance 
from it all to whisper "masscult, masscult" 
under their breath, but for the most part 
the crowd, consisting of panters and 
droolers, many of them men (is Paul 
le /avori pin-up of the Mattachine Society 
we began to wonder?) and lots of them 
perfectly middle-aged, was utterly lost 
and gonesville under the oceanic smash 
of passion. 

It was a crowd you could get pregnant 
in, just by the accident of proximity, and 
at any time one was ripe for the very 
fainting from asphyxiation if not from 
that psychosomatic thing that buckles 
fans at such moments; but one was saved 
time and time again by the rumor that 
this car just now nosing ominously 
through the crowds compliments of the 
police was IT!-the crowd would repeat-
edly arch up (one man in particular 
kept on groaning "ooh, ooh" in a despe-
rate voice) only to crash down on a 
decoy car full of simply no one. Was 
the old slyboots maybe concealed in the 
trunk? 

After knifing your way inside with 
long, menacing tickets (costing five 
dollars, or twenty-five dollars, or fifty 
dollars), there you saw a black tie replica? 
tion of the scene outside; this was one 
time when privilege didn't elevate you to 
the cool jaded heights of anything, it just 
meant that the dress that got ripped 
here was long and silk and ex.pensive. 

The lobby was full of valid grown-
ups like the Robert Liftons and C. Vann 
Woodward, but the fan-mag fever of 
the event made the whisper of his name 
seem like a great "aaaaapril fool" that 
deflated the two-second belief that it was 
actually Joanne, the little woman behind 
the blue eyes. Photographers kept on 
bending back like trampled friends, in a 
Fellini dreamy nightmare of clicking-
but whom?-it was worse than the Oscars 
for maddening little gray men who do 
all tbe work, but, alas, don't got what 
Paul's got. 

Some usherette, as if put there by 
conscience to punish the crowds for their 
fantasies, and who kept on saying crossly, 
"Look I really mean it, will you get the 
hell over there, move!!"-was the last 
raging voice one heard before two ex-
tremely sweaty and cross-looking people
