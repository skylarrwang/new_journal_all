appeared (Joanne Woodward and Paul 
Newman), snapping their heads this way 
and that as if looking in panic and rage 
for the exit in a fire. There was none 
of this darling, darling Janis, forever and 
ever yours. Bobby Vinton stuff in his 
demeanor-indeed he looked like the first 
person laboring under the influence of 
normalcy one had seen in the last thirty 
minutes. Here he was being thrown Ego-
Dog-Yummies by thousands of people, 
and being swaddled by a love that our 
mothers and our math teachers warned 
us never to expect from life-and yet here 
be was in the middle of it, preserving 
his mental health in a cocoon of fed-up 
maturity. It was most admirable, and if 
anyone was looking for something new 
in him to admire, there it was. Also one 
noticed that, after a lifetime of looming 
larger than life on the screen, that he 
looked rather smaller than life in life, that 
he was chewing gum or perhaps some 
gangster toothpick, that he had this orange 
thing around his neck, and that despite 
his crises of ontology and identity on 
movie marquees (Paul Newman IS Hud, 
Paul Newman IS Harper, Paul Newman 
IS the Hustler) that after aU he seemed 
to be rather Himself. 


After that, the most consciously con-
sumed person to come in-hey! and the 
little egomaniac isn't even in the movie-
was Barbra Streisand (yes, but she turns 
out to have formed a company for pro-
ducing movies with Poitier and Newman 
"to beat down some of the old Hollywood 
dinosaurs" as he explained it). Some 
of us who know and love her for her 
work were forced to admit that she is 
probably the most photogenic person on 
earth, given how much she looked like 
cause for teenage tears in Brooklyn 
bathroom mirrors in the flesh. In photo-
graphs what there is of the belle-/aide in 
her achieves a crazy style-but in real life 
her mouth wanders all over her face like 
a huge snake trying to get comfortable 
in a small bathtu~e sort of mouth 
Seventeen wants you to minimize by 
outlining weU inside the borders-and that 
remarkable nose seems like some un-
checked Co-op City growing disastrously 
in the middle of her face. And yet we 
absorbed this shock, grateful that looks 
weren't everything, Paul. 


After Newman and his entourage sat 
down, the brazen hordes stood stock still 
in the aisles, sinning already with him in 
their hearts and staring at him as delib-
erately as if he were the bottom line in 
an eye chart-and the usherette had her 
work cut out for her for another fifteen 
minutes, slicing hopelessly through 
the crowds with her hoarse voice. 


Yes, all right, but apart from mass 
sexual hysteria what was it that brought 
all these people so expensively and de-
votedly here? Something serious but 
swinging called the Yale Film Associates, 
with a board full of heavies and groovies, 
which is here to "support and encourage 
the study of film at Yale ... " for anyone 
" .. who believes that film is a significant 
and relevant subject for study .... " YFA, 
perhaps sensing a Bonnie-and-Clyde type 
mythic-landmark-of-the-screen whiff in 
the air, and capitalizing on the fact that 
both director George Roy Hill and Paul 
Newman were at Yale in some form (the 
latter a drop-out from the drama school 
but obviously of prodigal proportions), de-
cided to bunch itself through the medium 
of this benefit world premiere of Butch 
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and to give 
suckers, the rich and the star-mad, a 
chance to disguise themselves in the 
loftier category of lovers of art. And to 
add to the "big-firsts" of the evening, 
it was also the first major movie premiere 
ever held in New Haven. 


There was a lot of underlying reverence 
and seriousness and big guns rivalling 
the easy attraction of Newman. One was 
made to feel that beyond everything 
visible and big going on, that there lay 
something bigger (that same way Vogue 
has of bullying you into thinking about 
Vidal Sassoon, "There's more at stake 
here than just hair"). One could even 
begin with PN's presence as the smallest 
thing going on, and ascend by steps to 
the movie, the seminar the next day 
about the movie, the seriousness given 
to even the light aspects of the film by 
having them discussed by a panel con-
sisting of the stars, the director, the 
writer, Standish Lawder, etc., the movie 
made about the making of the movie, the 
Yale Film Associates with its impressive 
roster of names, the Art of Film-and also 
still feel that the ghost of the McCarthy 
Campaign was hovering about in the air 
somewhere, too. 


The presentation was finally tugged 
back into, as McLuhan would say, a 
"linear" context. Spencer Berger, the 
president of the YFA, stood up there 
behind a podium bravely talking on in the 
method of schoolteachers, until the fren-
zied crowds heard that he was talking 
and eventually left their vigil in the 
aisles, and sat down and shut up. There 
was something wonderfully polite and 
superfluous about "extending a warm 
welcome" to this man who we'd practically 
winepressed out of existence, but it re-
minded us of a world of rationality behind 
it all. 


Newman was to say the next day at the 
seminar, in response to something adula-
tory that had been said of him, "what he's 
trying to say is that the campus drunk 
f'mally made it." The air was thick with 
that sprt of myth that night (the line of 
privilege and talent and hot fortune forms 
on the right); people were being taken 
seriously and having fun at the same 
time, and they were somehow getting 
away with stuff on a large scale. The 
Yale Film Associates were blasting off 
with panache, certainly without stuffiness. 
William ("Boys and Girls Together," 
"Harper") Goldman's screenplay was 
being talked about at the seminar as 
groovy innovation, loose and free and 
anachronistie-and scenes and themes in 
George Roy Hill's direction were talked 
about at the seminar in a way that made 
us feel that we'd gotten even more for 
our money ... that was no movie, that 
was our homework. 


Butch Cassidy is the latest approach to 
the idea of hating westerns in general but 
liking this one right here a lot. Where 
your basic western (and even sometimes 
your basic antiwestern) tends to be bor-
ingly ballsy and afraid of displaying vul-
nerability especially in men, B.C. is full 
of cool or nervous little crimes (they rob a 
bank in Bolivia by reading their threats 
from a phrase book), awe of the other 
guys, self-doubt, remorse about killing, 
and even fear of the sort of stunts that 
westerns are made of (Redford tries to 
get out of jumping off a cliff into a fierce 
river because, as he finally confesses, he• 
can't swim). It is also elevated above 
the average by its similarity to Jules and 
Jim, because of the friendship between the 
two men and the lyrical presence of the 
girl shared emotionally, if not physically, 
between them. During the showing of the 
movie, PN took it upon himself several 
times to go "shhhh" in his role of the 
responsible member of the group sur-
rounded by lunacy, and finally about 
fifteen minutes before the end he, Robert 
Redford, Joanne Woodward and Barbra 
Streisand, flanked by the ubiquitous pro-
tectors, shot out a side entrance and 
went off to a party being given at Mory's. 


That party (although it looked like a 
whorehouse raid from outside, what with 
the cop cars) represented some kind of 
upward mobility in fandom. Yes, the 
windows were blacked out with bodies 
standing outside on the ledges and looking 
in, and yes, Paul Newman sat at the end 
of a long table next to Barbra and a few 
other insiders and was watched again as 
if he were the corpse in Dr. Tulpe's 
anatomy lesson-but at last the crowd had 
thinned itself out and refined itself 
(through tight invitations and bouncing) 
down to the people who realized how 
you possibly tell Paul Newman about 
how non-negotiable fan passion is. What 
can you possibly tell Paul Newman about 
himself thai he hasn't gathered through 
the evidence of his senses already? Here 
the crowd had, in some little way, grown 
up. Some of it may have been the com-
passionate looking away into the shrimp 
dish of people who have to put up with 
being stared at themselves. Some of it, 
inevitably, was just the bad luck of not 
fitting into the room where Himself was 
sitting. 


And yet, despite the relative elegance 
and discretion of the starers, there they 
were, interrupting their own conversations 
with jerky eye jumps over to Newman's 
chair, grilling his every casual act, and 
studying each turn of the head for new 
information on his profile. When he 
cocked his head toward the Whiffenpoofs 
with a roguish, gallant, "get-this-boys!" 
gesture as they sang a song from his 
movie to h~veryone watched. When 
Barbra pulled out her long hands which 
appear to begin just south of the elbow 
to clap at someone else's singing-we 
watched. It was too hard to believe that 
these people who are paid to fake laughs 
and smiles and tears and looks of doe-like 
surprise can have such a thing as a real 
life. It was easier to imagine that we were 
just watching him in the performance of 
apparently (but not really) spontaneous 
acts, and to posit an offstage voice saying 
"OK, now Paul, as naturally as you can, 
· pick up a match. Now sip some beer. 
Now lower your head and lift up your 
eyebrows-slowly, slowly-that's it." 


When you're in that racket, all the world's 
a screen test.
