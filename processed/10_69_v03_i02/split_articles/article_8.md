11 I The New Journal! October 12, 1969 
On Tuesday afternoon, July 22, the 
day after the opening of the first Pan-
African Cultural Festival, I was walking 
down mainstreet Algiers for the fourth 
time that day. The one and one-half 
· miles from Festival Information Center, 
126 Rue Didouche Mourad, towards the 
press center just past the Great Post Office 
were becoming country miles. About 
half-way there I passed by the Black 
Panther exposition center where workers 
behind locked glass doors had mysteri-
ously been putting up exhibits for two 
days. It should have been less of a surprise 
when a Festival guide ran up behind me 
to say that the center was finally going 
to open officially. I turned around and 
hurried into the display room filled with 
Emory Douglass revolutionary art and 
Black Panther Party posters. The room 
was only beginning to fill up with people. 
As a crowd entered I walked to the rear 
and found myself facing Eldridge 
Cleaver. 

There was no planned program beyond 
Madame Erve's welcoming speech, stress-
ing that the Panthers had come to the 
Festival to dramatize their solidarity with 
the oppressed people of the world and 
that this "historic link-up" was 
"beautiful." By now the room was packed 
and newsmen were pushing their way 
towards Cleaver. Near him were his 
pregnant wife Kathleen, Ted Joans, 
David Hilliard, the Party's minister of 
culture Ed Bullins, Skip Malone, George 
Black and other Panthers. An impromptu 
press conference began. 

Eldridge Cleaver, minister of informa-
tion for the Black Panther Party, had 
only recently flown to Algiers from 
Havana, where he had been in secret 
self-exile. For nearly two years since skip-
ping bail in California the author of 
Soul on Ice had vanished from public 
sight. It was only towards the end of 
his seclusion, when a reporter from 
Reuters stumbled on to him in Havana, 
that the world found out where Cleaver 
had been in hiding. There was under-
standable excitement among the four or 
five American newsmen in the exposition 
room in Algiers, who would become the 
first of their country's journalists to make 
contact with Cleaver in two ye.ars. 

Eldridge Cleaver was first asked what 
he thought of the moon landing the day 
before. In response, he relied on Ted 
Joans who read his newly composed poem 
describing the event. "Soar Grapes." 
"Into their concept of perfect blue 
they took millions of dollars .. , " began 
Joans. Cleaver himself added that "if the 
moon shot was calculated to help human-
ity it was a dismal failure!' In 
fact he wished that "Tricky Dick had 
been one of the astronauts" and that the 
space capsule had remained on the moon. 

The crowd and the movie lights sur-
rounding Cleaver made the heat in the 
room intolerable. His dashiki was drip-
ping wet, and he seemed alone, sullen 
and somehow trapped-a kind of existen-
tial hero. He was a man without a 
country, and he made no attempt to 
conceal his hostility for the US press and 
government. An American AP reporter 
asked if the Algerian government helped 
finance the Black Panther Party. Eldridge 
blurted, "Identify yourself!" TI:ien he 
followed, "Tell J. Edgar Hoover, Richard 
Nixon and Senator John McClellan 
that Lady Bird Johnson finances the 
Black Panther Party!" Kathleen Cleaver, 
seated beside her husband, showed a cool 
disdain for the American reporters. When 
one of them became intrigued by the 
flamboyant color of her dress, he asked 
shyly, and innocently enough, if it were 
African. "Hell no," she smiled, "It's a 
maternity dress." 

In a later interview Cleaver implied 
that he missed the United States and that 
he might like to go back and face the 
trial for which he had skipped bail. He 
explained that he was not a fugitive from 
j.ustice as he had never been convicted. 
Maintaining that his only crime was 
skipping bail, he said the United States 
didn't want him to stand trial because it 
"knew" he would win. 

The opening press conference left a 
direct discussion of the United States and 
turned to the crisis in the Middle East. 
Cleaver said that the Black Panther Party 
understood the Jews' long tradition of 
suffering. But it distinguished between 
their suffering "and the problems they 
now cause for other people." Thus 
Cleaver expressed the solidarity of his 
party with El Fatah, the Palestinian 
liberation movement. Hilliard summed up 
Panther policy and reopened the indict-
ment of the US by snarling, "Whatever 
the enemy supports we oppose; whatever 
the enemy opposes we support." 

Throughout the Festival, Cleaver 
stated again and again that "culture is 
invalid unless political." It was the theme 
of the entire Festival. The Black 
Panthers incarnated the theme, and it 
was probably why they were even invited 
to Algiers and why the Algerian govern-
ment provided them with the exposition 
center. In addition to the thirty-six African 
nations which attended, the Festival 
committee had invited the Black Panthers, 
El Fatah, the NLF and six African 
nationall.iberation movements: ANC 
(South Africa), MPLA (Angola), 
PAIGC (Guiney Bissau and the Cape 
Verde Islands), Frelimo (Mozambique), 
Swapo (Nambia) and ZAPU (Southern 
Rhodesia) . All these groups used the 
Festival as a forum for their revolutionary 
propaganda. 

Ha-Xuan-Trong, vice minister of cul-
ture of the Democratic Republic of 
Vietnam, addressing a writer's collo-
quiem at the Festival, expressed the soli-
darity of his people with the various 
liberation movements and presented a 
definition expanding Cleaver's criterion 
for cultural validity. 

Culture is a front of struggle, and each cul-
tural worker is a militant. True culture is 
above all humanistic and revolutionary, in 
the sense that it does not delight with the 
comfortable surrogate that the oppressor 
offers it to better incite it to the inaction 
and apathy that serve only his egotistical 
interests. It has to be dynamic and carry in 
it the virtue of exhorting, discovering and 
edifying the humane, the beautiful, the 
useful. 

The North Vietnamese delegation 
headed by Vice Minister Trong later 
visited the Panthers at their center for a 
short while. David Hilliard, after first 
asking for someone among the spectators 
to translate his words into French. stated 
that the two movements were striving 
for a mutual goal, the liberation of their 
oppressed peoples. The two ministers 
then shook hands, as George Black, 
Yale '66, explained that if other move-
ments and governments could have a party 
hierarchy so could the Black Panthers. 
In fact the Panthers could even have a 
foreign service, another reason why they 
h~d come to Algiers. It is this point of 
view, coupled to their cooperation with 
whites, that separates the Black Panthers 
and Stokely Carmichael. 

Cooperation with whites became crucial 
to the Panther's legitimacy, as the oppro-
brium "racist," intrinsic or merely 
attributed, became the Achilles heel of the 
Black Panthers in Algiers. The Black 
Panther Party of today maintains that it 
aims at cooperation with white radicals, 
though it may have begun as a racist 
organization. When Stokely Carmichael, 
who still clings to black racism, flew to 
the Festival, he viciously attacked the 
Panther's claim. When Stokely first 
ambled down the streets of Algiers, he 
did not attract attention. To the few, 
there was the recognizable lean, mad 
look. At the Festival his racist philosophy 
drf!w little support, while it did foster 
among whites even more suspicion of the 
Panthers, who are seeking their coopera-
tion. He was bellicose, cantankerous and 
more dogmatic than usual in maintaining 
that the Panthers had "betrayed" black 
men everywhere. Stokely had flown to 
the Festival late as a kind of self-appointed 
delegate, stayed at the Georges V, the best 
hotel in town, and returned to Guinea 
where he was .reportedly learning French 
with his new wife, Miriam Makeba. 

Algerians had filled the Panther center, 
even if cautiously, to meet Cleaver, but 
they, and the Panthers, avoid Carmichael. 
In the Tuesday conference, Cleaver him-
self dismissed Stokely with a quip about 
the split between the Panthers and 
Carrnichael-''We meet with Stokely only 
when we run into him." On several 
occasions Cleaver also felt obligated 
to hold special conferences to explain 
the non-racist policy of his party. These 
meetings usually ended as shouting 
matches with doubting Algerians. But 
try as they did to convince Algerians 
of their non-racism, the Panthers didn't 
succeed, because of an ironic and tragic 
fault not of their own making. 

If the Festival revealed anything about 
the personality of the African continent . 
it demonstrated once and for all the deep 
racial prejudice between generally white 
Arab North Africa and black Africa to 
the south. Algerians taunted members of a 
black cultural delegation with "Salut 
Negre." A black African would retort, 
"Salut Arabe." In short, many Algerians 
seemed to dislike Negroes more than 
Jews. The Black Panthers were popular 
at the Festival often solely because they 
were professed revolutionaries. They were 
suspected on two rather incompatible 
counts-because they couldn't shake their 
former racist image, and more simply, 
because they were black. 

This suspicion and distrust OR the part 
of the Algerians was countered by the 
fraternity with the black African Libera-
tion Movements. At a dinner Denis 
Brutus, of the African National Congress, 
a South African poet in exile, expressed 
fear for Rhodesia, Australia and the 
United States as a result of the infectious 
appeal of apartheid, and casually dropped, 
"I hope that when the USA pulls out of 
Vietnam it'll have a few extra B52's for 
sale. By this time the only way to get rid 
of apartheid is to blow it out." Sirens, 
Knuclcles and Boots is the poet's label for 
his country's racial segregation and the 
title for his own book of poetry which 
includes "Nightsong City": 

Sleep welJ, my love, sleep welJ: 
The harbor lights glaze over restless docks; 
Police cars cockroach through the tunnel 
streets; 
From the shanties creakiilg iron-sheets 
Violence is tossed like a bug-infested rag 
And fear is imminent as sound in the wind-
swung bell; 
The day's long anger pants from sand and 
rocks; 
but for this breathing night at least, 
my land, my love, sleep well. 

The poet also poses a question that 
faces the Panthers. As they popu-
larize their movement with white radicals 
and become even more of a political 
threat to the government, will repression 
be initiated to end the party itself? More 
than a few feel this has already begun. 

The Black Panther center at the 
Festival was a constant curiosity. But 
oddly it was Algerian students, and not 
black Africans visiting Algiers, who 
flocked there all day every day. Even in 
the evenings after the center's glass door 
were once again locked, one would see a 
group of them looking through the glass 
at Eldridge Cleaver, standing in the 
camera lights of the European press. At 
the close of that memorable press con-
ference of early Tuesday afternoon, 
George Black hastily gathered a pile of 
Emory Douglass posters which ambiti-
ously proclaimed, "Solidarity with the 
Oppressed Peoples of the World" and 
carried them outside in front of the 
Panther center. He climbed on a car and 
began distributing them to the out-
stretched hands of the Algerian students 
who were swarming around him. All of ~ 
sudden, as if possessed with the dream 
of every revolution ever made or begun, 
they began chanting again and again, in a 
roar that must have been heard down 
mainstreet Algiers all the way from 126 
Rue Didouche Mourad to just past the 
Great Post Office, "Le pouvoir 
aupeuple."e
