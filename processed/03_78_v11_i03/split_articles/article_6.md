could not reach by foot. Long and 
beautiful beaches stretched the whole 
l~ngth of the island. 

Occasionally I would find an old 
bit of an anchor or hull buried in the 
sand, casting shadows on the grainy 
shore; bits of broken glass which had 
been worn down by the sea sparkled 
next to it. Some of the dunes near the 
island's only hotel, The Third Turtle 
Inn, rose to heights of twenty feet or 
more, populating the calm horizon. 

From· the moment I arrived at 
Provo, as it has come to be called, 
there was music. As soon as the plane 
landed, I heard a band of simple 
instruments. A middle-aged man 
began to dance and children joined in 
around him. I felt as though I had 
interrupted some ancient ritual. I later 
realized that the landing of the plane 
was a ritual -
it brought food, the 
latest Time magazine, shoes, supplies 
for the two stores on the island. In 
the undulating pattern of life on 
ProvidenciaJes, its arrival was an 
exotic motif, forcing a comparison of 
the world I came from and that of 
Providenciales, on the island's terms 
instead of mine. 

One morning I went to the airport 
to wait for the plane among the 
variegated crowd of islanders, 
musacian!>, and interlopers like myself. 
The band began to play at eleven. 
The plane had not arrived at noon, 
and by one o'clock waiting faces 
began to show signs of worry. At two 
we wondered if the clumsy DC-6 had 
finally plummeted into the blue-green 
Caribbean. Finally a tall, officialJy 
dressed man stepped out of the scant 
airport building and announced that 
the plane had just left Miami, would 
arrive at four that afternoon. We 
heard on the one-way radio that 
someone had made an emergency 
landing on South Caicos the night 
before. Amidst the general relief, a 
little boy ran up to me ... Will you 
take my picture? You haven't taken 
my picture yet." 

The sun set as the plane arrived; it 
would have to take off by moonlight, 
since the runway had no electricity. 
Gradually, lights from the shanties 
glanced off the retreating waves, the 
heavy plane lifted itself into the sky, 
and I walked on to Blue Hill!> to 
recapture the music of the morning.

Human Brain 
Assembly Instructions 
Items needed: 
Two large (22" X 28") sheets of thin poster board 
Rubber cement or paper glue 
Single edge razor blade or X-acto knife 
Scissors 
Paper tape 
Tacks 
Sma/1 board (4" X 5" or larger) 
Carefully remove all brain model pages from the centerfold. Lay out and glue 
or cement the pages on the poster board. Carefully cut out all the individual 
pieces, notching the tabs a little more than indicated. Stack the pieces in order not 
to lose any. Using a single razor blade or an X-acto knife, cut all the slots, 
making sure to cut all the way through the entire length of the slot (better a little 
too much than not enough, but do not get carried away). Fold any pieces on 
dotted lines if so indicated. Arrange the pieces before you so that all are visible. 
The pieces are identified by their distinctive tab, slot, or tack numbers. 
Take the ·rectangular stand piece with tack numbers and place it on a small 
piece of wood. Tack it to the wood with tacks 1-4. Take the piece containing tab 
1 and place it in slot I , slipping the cerebellum through slot zero and the splenium 
in the slot above it. Align tack positions 5-16 on the piece containing slot zero 
with those on the board and tack it down. Continue-assembling tabs and slots in 
order: flrst numbers, then letters, and finally Roman numerals. 

It would be best to tape each · letter tab and slot combination on the back side 
as they are assembled. Once the Roman numerals are completed, the finished 
cortex can be split apart slightly on the midline and slid over the stand. After 
careful assembly, this brain model becomes a welcome study aid. 

A numbered guide which provides easy identification of each puzzle piece is 
available, free. Write HUMAN BRAIN, cf o The New Journal, 3432 Yale Station,
