**Title: Statement from the Hearing on the P. Bear Incident**
**Author: Alfred Sturtevant**
**Page number(s): 3**

Well, it happened at the victory celebration over at Piglet's house. That was one for Owl's re-election to the post of Governor-General of the Forest - you remember, the one with the 99% turnout at the polls? We were all understandably pleased with the way things had gone, though not unprepared; in fact, the invitations had been out for weeks, and of course the memorial and the catering were arranged two months in advance. But really, an election in a one-party police state is never much of a surprise.


What's that? Oh yes, I admit it - you'd have to be rather a fool not to recognize the set-up here, despite all that "People's Democratic Republic" nonsense (incidentally, this is a closed hearing, isn't it?). We all feel quite happy with the way we've arranged things in the Forest. Once we got CR out of the picture - oh, did you like that? yes, that was Roo's idea; ingenious, wasn't it? Though really, most of this was Roo's idea. He'd been reading some of CR's history books, and later, well, we all helped him get more material. Of course, we were shattered, simply shattered, by hls death - such a waste, we all felt ... and we'd no idea his mother was a loyalist; one wouldn't have thought, with the way CR treated her in the old days - but I suppose we'll never know.


The party, yes of course. It was very nice - lots of food and drink, and Tigger had persuaded a troop of those young Mousettes to come along, so after the ceremony with the Roo memorial things began to get quite jolly. I remember Piglet said something about his neighbors and the noise, but we sent Rabbit and a few of his friends over and there wasn't any more trouble.


Well, we had music, and then dancing, and then a lot of speeches about the Glorious Martyr, and how-moving-such-a-noble-display-popular-affection-anniversary-his-infamous-murder, and then more dancing. As I said, it was quite jolly.


I think it was about then that Pooh got up and started sounding off. Actually, he'd been at it for a while before we noticed - there was rather a lot else to do, you see. Pooh bad been acting glum for weeks, and we all felt he was hitting the bottle a bit hard; Piglet says he saw him crying on some little mouse-girl's shoulder earlier in the evening. At any rate, none of us were particularly surprised to see him cutting loose, so when we realized he was talking we all gathered round to listen. A couple of mice cheered, and a few others began laughing and jeering. He didn't seem to appreciate that, so I ... well, I'd always rather liked old Pooh Bear, especially after that tail incident, so I had them discreetly bushed up. We couldn't make out what be was saying, there was a lot of competition, what with Tigger and Rabbit returning, and Pooh had to start shouting - I believe he mentioned Kanga, and then plots, and traitors, and something about conscience. We all felt this was in rather questionable taste, considering the day, and were 9 about to suggest he move on to a more congenial topic, when suddenly be gave a funny sort of wheeze and clutched his chest. At first we were very alarmed, particularly when he fell off the table, but Owl pointed out it was just aU that drink hitting old Pooh at last, and some of Rabbit's friends helped us to carry him over to a corner to sleep it off. We all agreed he looked quite comical; the mice were hysterical with laughter.


When? I understand it was about a half-hour later. Actually I wasn't there when they found out, I'd left with a friend. But, again as I understand it, some mouse-girl was going through Pooh's pockets when she began to shriek, and then of course they all saw. It came as a terrible shock to me, simply terrible; after all, Pooh had been one of us from the start, CR's favorite, so a marvelous source. I think you'll understand if I tell you I broke down and cried at the State Funeral, and Piglet -


Oh. Well, you're more than welcome - I'm anxious to help in any way I can to apprehend the party responsible for this monstrous crime against the State (that's from my new poster- have you seen it yet?). I'm sure that you are all as confident as I am that the perpetrator shall be brought to justice by the time the year is out, and that you will show no leniency. I know he would have wanted it that way.


Thank you, gentlemen.


**Title: Commacal**

Recent scholarship has provided a fundamentally new approach toward understanding John Milton's syntactic and semantic usage in Paradise Lost.' By systematically applying the vast compendia of modern linguistic procedures of deep structure analysis, one garners new cognitive interpretations '6f this epic poet's manipulation of grammatical, syntactical, and punctuational devices. The present study focuses our attention on Milton's punctuational notation: particular emphasis being laid to rest on his heroic use of the seemingly banal: the rudiments of English punctuation: the comma (,), the semicolon (; or â€¢ ), the colon (:), and the period (.) The occurrences in his works of the exclamation mark (!) and the question mark (?) are so rare as not to warrant their serious consideration in this study. (The interested reader is commended to two f'me articles on the frequency and specific usages of these two punctuational marks in E. I. Symington-Bradshaw's classic nineteenth century treatise: The Renaissance Comma (Princeton, 1825).)


Of the many laudable exempla available for our consideration, one is chosen as a model for our comparative analysis. This aesthetic masterpiece of style far exceeds the exigencies of our explication:


Not just, not God; not fear'd then, nor obey'd: (IX, 701)


The casual perusal of even the disaffected reader cannot help but make him yield in submission to the wealth and regal majesty of this dulcet clause. The fJrSt comma breaks forth with a gasconade of Milton's prosodic acumen: it initiates our analytical process. The fJrSt comma, standing in the critical position following the second word and signalling the first of two caesurae in this line, stands as an continued to page 15
