The Rise and Fall of V 
by Lee Lieberman and 
Richard Vigilante 
V's fruit selling period marked the 
apex of a distinguished career. The 
fruit business is no rags to riches 
fly-by-night enterprise for shifty spec-
ulators. It takes hard honest toil. But 
at last, V was a man of station, 
honored by those he loved -
which 
is a kind of greatness. 

V had shifted his comer. The Greek 
had disappeared, a disappearance 
which may seem providential to the 
reader. The Greek had a truck. He 
had driven it away. Without seeming 
overeager, V's plywood fruit cart built 
on top of a shopping wagon and 
covered with a sheet (for decoration) 
approached the corner and took its 
place. The response of the public was 
gratifying. V's income doubled over-
night and grew steadily after that. No 
longer was he put to shame by giving 
away bananas at three o'clock. V 
made confident predictions about the 
state of the fruit market to his 
friends, and his family acclaimed him 
as a genius. 

V, his father, had not always had 
such a fine opinion of his son. His 
son was a bum; a congenital and 
worthless bum. His son only a few 
months before had left Yale halfway 
through a tuition payment. "Leaving 
Yale" perhaps gives an impression of 
more activity on his son's part than 
actually took place. Better to say that 
there came a time when his son was 
no longer at Yale. Nor was he 
anywhere else. He was relaxing. His 
mother Va, who had no more regard 
for her son than did her husband, got 
V a job in a matzoh ball warehouse. 
This was a bit strange, since V is a 
notably Italian name. But V's father, 
who had had scholastic training, 
pointed out that V would not actually 
be working in the warehouse but on 
the delivery truck. Va was a bit 
concerned about her son's plight. But 
her husband, who felt strongly about 
the matter, laid down the law in no 
uncertain terms. Like Sisyphus, V was 
atoning for his sins by rolling an 
eternal matzoh ball up an endless hill. 
Va was much comforted. V was fired. 

V was next employed as a clerk 
on Wall Street. He flourished for a 
while, writing down numbers and 
adding or subtracting them, and 
answering the telephone. During his 
lunch hour, V watched the Greek. 
The Greek was a genius. He sold 
apples and oranges for 25e a piece 
and bananas at two for a quarter. He 
sold I ,200 pieces of fruit a day and 
made 900 dollars a week. V earned 80 
dollars a week after taxes. V decided 
to emulate the Greek. 

Va was distressed at the notion of 
replacing my son at Yale with my son 
the peddler. V's brother, at pains to 
help, quietly offered to get V a job 
writing symphonies, so the family 
shouldn't worry. V senior smiled 
sardonically, pleased with the ac-
curacy of his predictions. His son 
would be a bum after all. V obtained 
a licence, stole a shopping cart, 
bought materials, and talked eagerly 
about the conflict between a fast 
moving banana and a high priced 
apple. His friends regarded him with 
sadness. 

At trrst V's fruit was not greeted 
with enthusiasm. The passersby 
noticed V and the fruit, but were not 
impressed by the fact that he was 
selling it. They did not seem to realize 
that they were part of the process. V 
was forced to rechannel some of his 
product. He made many apple pies. 
V's father was pleased -
he liked 
apple pies. But with the departure of 
the Greek, everything changed. 

Crowds swarmed around V's cart. 
Women grabbed and squeezed the 
fruit, even the bananas. It was okay: 
they sold anyway. Businessmen man-
fully plucked apples off the top of the · 
cart. Children screamed for more fruit 
and waved sticky orange-juice-covered 
hands over their heads. Wandering 
minstrels attracted by the crowds sang 
their lays and plucked their guitars 
and passed their hats. V gave them 
free apples in remembrance of his 
brother. 

V did not forget his family in· his 
days of greatness, and they were 
humbly grateful. Va, moist-eyed, 
marvelled over her son. V muttered 
something about Prince Hal. but 
neither came o'er his son with his 
wilder days nor measured what use he 
had made of them. In fact, he 
wavered between deference and a 
dignified and distant respect. With the 
hopeful awe of the amateur ad-
dressing the professional, he gave his 
son advice about handling bananas. 
Once the object of scorn and derision, 
but now righteous and successful (or 
successful and righteous), V was 
clutched to the bosom of his family 
and beamed light upon them. 

. The next day, a policeman appeared. 
A local merchant had complained that 
V's cart was interfering with his own 
business. Jealousy, that green-eyed 
monster, hath ever been a rag tag 
camp follower to the fortunes of the 
great. The policeman told V to vacate 
the premises, suggested that this 
might be accomplished simply by 
pushing the cart round to the other 
side of the comer, wrote a summons 
(for a minor violation), winked, 
pocketed an apple, and strode away, 
having fulfilled his duty as the 
defender of the public peace. V's 
fortunes, however, were not secure. 

The next morning a second policeman 
appeared. He politely informed V that 
he and his cart were in a restricted 
area. V, firm in the knowledge of the 
municipal regulations concerning fruit 
sellers and their carts, politely in-
quired where wasn't a restricted area. 
The policeman informed V with pride 
that there were no non-restricted 
areas in his precinct, and that his 
precinct extended several miles in 
every duectiori. V's ~rt was carrying a 
large, heavy, expensive load, and it 
was almost lunch hour. V continued 
to sell fruit. The sight of V selling 
fruit drove the policeman to a frenzy. 
He began to write summonses very 
quickly. He wrote thirteen of them. 
Then he began· to yell and threaten V 
with the paddy wagon. When he 
finally left, he was quite red in the 
face, and V's profits for the day had 
evaporated. 

In the morning, the Greek was 
there. On the comer. V's corner. The 
Greek's comer. V pushed the cart into 
its usual position. The Greek walked 
over and smiled. "Hello my friend," 
said the Greek. "What are you 
doing?" V replied that he was selling 
fruit, 25¢ for apples and oranges and 
bananas 2 for a quarter. "This is my 
corner," said the Greek. "You go 
back to your comer." V explained 
that since the Greek had been away 
for quite some time, this was now V's 
corner. "This is my corner," the 
Greek repeated. "You must go away." 
V began to set up for the day's work. 
"Okay," said the Greek. "I am going 
to kill you." 

Fortunately, this was unnecessary. 
When the crowds began to come, they 
came to the Greek. Not all of them, 
of course. The laws of chance 
wouldn't stand for that. V got an 
occasional customer. Probability, it 
seems, is only reliable when dealing 
with very large numbers. How many 
businessmen did not want an apple at 
the moment they passed V's cart, and 
were yet ravenous with apple hunger 
a few seconds later when they passed 
the Greek? By the end of the day all 
thoughts of murder had vanished 
from the mind of the Greek. The . 
Greek, no doubt, realized that 
Hercules was with him. At any rate, 
at three o'clock, the Greek, fruitless 
and smiling, closed down his truck 
and drove away. 

On the opposite side of the street, 
o·n a comer a block away, an old 
woman tended a hot dog stand. She 
was very ugly' and entirely round 
except for her legs, which were 
square. Finished for the day, she 
pushed her cart over to V. "You did 
not do much business today. I buy 
from you. Give me some apples." V 
sold her half a dozen. She pushed her 
cart away, and V began to pack up 
his merchandise. 

It had begun to rain before V 
reached the subway station. The 
soggy blue cardboard apple box 
smeared all over V's shirt, turning it 
blue as well. His fruit under one arm 
and six frozen pie shells in the o~her, 
V occupied more than his share of an 
already irritable subway car. 

The subway car was made more 
irritable by the progress of a blind 
man down the aisle. He was a beggar. 
He held a tin cup in his hands and 
shook it very loudly under the noses 
of the passengers. As often as not, 
they gave him something, and he 
stumbled down the aisle, leaving them 
in peace. He stepped neatly around 
the pole and stood in front of V. He 
was a fat, well-fed blind man. 

The beggar cast a contemptuous 
glance at V, smiled at a woman 
wearing a fox, and collected a crisp 
dollar bill. V began to muse. He 
considered .his profits for the day, his 
status in the community, and, on the 
other hand, the rewards of the 
mendicant life. V calculated carefully. 
And so, like Homer, Milton and 
the glorious Panikofsky, V became a 
blind man. V's father was pleased by 
his son's classical afflliations; and 
after bottoming out, V's tmancial 
condition stabilized.
