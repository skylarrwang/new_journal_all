**Title: The Disney Manifesto**
**Author: Roberta L Baker**
**Page number(s): 2**

In 1971, two Chilean exiles wrote a book about Donald Duck. They called it Imperialist Ideology in the Disney Comic, and set out to expose a familiar water fowl as a fiend of fiends: the child imperialist. The Christian Science Monitor's man in Santiago, Brother Sebastian, remarked that "as long as the smiling face of Donald Duck parades innocently throughout Chilean cities, as long as Donald Duck means power and collective representation, then imperialism and the bourgeoisie can sleep peacefully."


Evidently, the allegations against one of America's favorite beasts stem from what he di4 to the Abominable Snowman: in one comic strip D. Duck swindled the tundra despot out of Ghengis Khan's precious stones - for which he swapped a cheap watch. It was Timex model 117, with luminous digits and an imitation leopard band.


From accounts contained in The Collected Abominations, the snowman's posthumously published diary, it is clear that two days before the transaction, a pregnant Kodiak bear identified by the Sierra Club as Daisy threatened to maul the aforementioned snowman if he did not hand over his Bulova "Marquis." Fearing for his life, he complied with the angry bear's requests.


In a subsequent entry, A. Snowman confessed that he was a "sucker for beasts of burden" and "fair birds from temperate regions." Lottie Mendoza, a housekeeper in Fort Jeffrey, Saskatchewan, testified that on the night of January 20, 1942, a creature wearing Muk-luks and aT-shirt, toting a shopping bag and answering the description of A. Snowman, entered a bar and grill in the Italian section of Fort Jeffrey with a large canary slung over his shoulder.


Joanne Watson, the harassed bird, told police that "the son of a bitch thought I was a duck. We got to this room at the back of this bar, and he took some kind of feather suit out of a shopping bag and said 'Put this on.' Then he blew up this kiddie pool, you know the kind from Sears. He filled it with water and said, 'Get in.' He was making these duck calls and splashing around me. He was starting to melt. That's when the police came in."


The Abominable Snowman was· arraigned in Fort Jeffrey municipal court on January 21, 1942, on two counts of disturbing the peace, and bestiality.


A. Snowman's biographer, D. Edgeworth Stickwell of Cambridge, disclosed information on Snowman's youth to Scotland Yard, after the hardbound edition of Imperialist Ideology in the Disney Comic hit the U Diversity bookshelves. According to Stickwell, A. Snowman was of Chilean descent. Anatomically, he represented a rare genus of high altitude Andes mammalia that, because of Peace Corps reforestation and guerilla warfare, migrated south to the Cape of Good Hope and north to the Aleutian Islands. It is possible, states Stickwell, that Snowman "was sidetracked" to Saskatchewan, or "got lost." At any rate, Stick well revealed the identity of Snowman's paternal grandfather to Yard officials. Juan (Gem) Fritato, alias "Pop-Pop" in Snowman's Collected Abominations, operated a small jewelry store in Santiago and served until 1971 as quality control consultant at Timex International of Santiago.


Stickwell, upon close examination of Snowman's estate, discovered a medium-sized cardboard box; it contained forty-three discontinued Timex watchbands - veritable collector's items. The most valuable one, according to the Chase Manhattan Diamond Exchange, is the imitation leopard band, which Snowman purchased from Donald Duck.


This points to the fact that the Abominable Snowman was not swindled by an American bird. But it does not vindicate Donald Duck from Chilean accusations of imperialism, or Walt Disney from being American. The evidence lies in How to Read Donald Duck: Imperialist Ideology in the Disney Comic, which reads like the Communist Manifesto. Ariel Dorfman and Armand Mattelart think and write on that thin line between absurd viability t and viable absurdity. The book is not a work of enduring literary distinction, and the two gentlemen of Santiago remain in exile.


**Title: A Modest Proposal**
**Page number(s): 2-3**

Yale University finds itself in the midst of a financial crisis of unprecedented proportions. In order to achieve lasting economic equilibrium, Yale must adopt a new philosophical stance towards education. The age of carefree expansion and economic largesse is over. It is time to buckle our belts.


The notion of "pay-as-you-go" has never been strong currency in the academic marketplace. It is time for the Invisible Hand to make its appearance. We must restructure Yale.


In the future, all applicants to Yale must submit a non-refundable $1000 application fee. The first 2500 applications received after January I will determine the following September's freshman class. All those students matriculating will be required to post a $100,000 bond in advance to pay for four years at Yale. There will be no scholarships or student work programs, thereby eliminating the stigma of financial inequality.


In order to accommodate the great influx of new students (which will follow from the doubling of each class' size), several steps will be undertaken. All college libraries will be closed, their books auctioned, and their space converted to dormitory rooms. All living rooms in suites will become bedrooms for four students, and all off-campus housing will be prohibited.


Within each college, masters and deans and their staffs will be replaced by one College Manager. Hot water will be limited to the hours of 6 to 7 a.m. Electricity will be available only during the night hours. All electrical appliances (e.g., clocks) will be subject to stiff energy surcharges.


Students will voluntarily perform all custodial services in all University buildings. (Yale's blue collar strike experience has ably demonstrated the University's capacity for self-sufficiency in this regard.)


All dining hall service will be contracted to the Macke Company. As they are currently run, the dining halls are both expensive and inefficient. By the introduction of automatic food vending machines, a cautious balance between cost efficiency and the dining halls' traditional dignity could be struck. Only three dining halls would be open; this is sure to guarantee greater inter-college communication. Students might not eat what they pay for, but at least they would pay for what they eat.


Several far-reaching academic changes are foreseen. All special programs would be eliminated (e.g., Directed Studies). No double majors would be permitted without surcharge. Each student would take at least 75 per cent lecture courses. Summer terms will be mandatory, graduate students will be required to be unpaid teaching assistants, and undergraduate students will also be encouraged to take on teaching responsibilities.


In the future, faculty salaries will be based on enrollment levels in the individual professors• courses. Tenure will not be given. Professors will be subject to a mandatory publication schedule, and in order to increase faculty competition to publish, Yale U Diversity Press will close. Early continued to page 15
