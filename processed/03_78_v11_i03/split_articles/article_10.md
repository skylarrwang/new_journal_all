Two voices; one of them, his. 
The carving of paper is blessed 
by these, my colored hands,

Echoing lively as creatures seen in the brown a1r of the stud1o, 
And building, sweet hot creatures out of the white a1r, shapes 
fit to jar the kisses in this old man's brain -
The paper is obviously 
Blessed out of need. 
Out of· the need for smoking grades, 
Out of the need for blending. 
Its clearest texture 
Is the prtss of 
shape .. . 
And what shapes 
I've given 
to the tones of that earthwork land!

ominous precursor to the triumphal 
conclusion of the line in the colon 
itself. As if this were not enough, 
Milton teases the reader's unsatiated 
philological hunger with the semi-
colon immediately juxtaposed to the 
comma in the succeeding phrase. Both 
commas, like the fire of simultaneous 
artillery during the pre-dawn hours of 
a long and rancorous war, herald 
central preeminence of this semicolon. 
This is the Implied Majestic Depend-
ency Usage of the semicolon, 
according to R. Winslow's gram-
matical and punctuational classifica-
tions. 

The succinct and indefatigable 
colon, falling at the end of the line 
when the reader is least suspecting of 
but another mark of punctuation, 
fulfills but again the Grand Design of 
the epic voice incarnate. Would that 
this might be enough, but the never 
tiring master delivers to us still 
another treat: perhaps the penultimate 
literary achievement: the two occur-
rences of the noble apostate 
apostrophe: a fitting conclusion.

retirement without pensions will be 
promoted. In addition, every depart-
ment will be asked to fiscally justify 
its existence each year. 

All University buildings (except 
Woodbridge Hall) will be subject to a 
modest admission charge. Library 
hours will be strictly limited to two 
hours a day, five days a week. 

Students will assume the responsi-
bility for reshelving all library 
materials. All underutilized library 
collections will be liquidated, and 
book and periodical purchases will 
cease. Book gifts will continue to be 
received, but they will be liable to 
auction. Beinecke Library will be 
cleared of all books and will be 
converted into administrative offices. 

Payne Whitney Gymnasium will be 
sold to the City of Cleveland, and 
only pr.ofitable sports like football 
and hockey will continue. Yale 
University Police Officers will be 
fired. In their place, student vigilante 
groups will be asked to maintain law 
and order. Formal graduation will be 
eliminated; modem computer print-
outs will replace anachronistic 
diplomas. All social activities will be 
run for profit by the University. 

What has been described above, 
and more, has been modestly termed 
.. Project Profit" by its planners. 
Preliminary figures project a $370 
million budget surplus by 1984. As 
early as 1981, it should be possible to 
begin aggressive reinvestment of this 
money in diversified profit-making 
enterprises. Target areas for capital 
concentration would include oil pro-
duction and military hardware. The 
planners look towards a time when 
Yale University as we now know it is 
but one small part of a giant and vital 
enterprise: the Yale Corporation.

**Title: Meeting Malle**
**Author: Jan Kie**

Meeting Malle 
In his talk two weeks ago at Yale, 
Louis Malle told of his ftrst directing 
experience for deep-sea diver Jacques 
Cousteau ... In the beginning, I treated 
my actors as if I were direcf,ing fiSh." 
Certainly this is the kind of directing 
that Malle is rebelling against now, 
and this rebellion of immediacy is 
exactly what makes his movies great. 
It wiU be interesting to see what he 
does in his first American movie, 
Pretty Baby, a story exploring child 
prostitution, which wiii soon be 
released. Until now, our reaction to 
his movies has been that of deep-sea 
divers in an alien French ocean, and 
if the Yale audience is any indication, 
it is an ocean of over-intellectualiza-
tion and trivialization. Louis Malle 
managed to cope quite nicely with the 
vacuous questions in Linsly-Chit, 
answering, as his movies do, with 
anecdotes and imagery. 

His films convey their beauty in a 
very special way. Lacombe, Lucien 
traces the affair of a young French 
Nazi and a wealthy Jewish girl. The 
most important scene in the film 
starts with a shot of Lucien, the 
protagonist, crouched naked next to 
the body of France, who is sleeping 
with her back towards us. Slowly, he 
traces the outline of her lower back 
and hips, with a motion that is highly 
erotic, loving, and awed by the reality 
of the touch. The following scene 
shows the mutilated corpses of his 
friends in the harsh sun and dust of 
southern France. In this series of 
images, Malle has brought together 
some of the more striking contrasts 
and feelings possible, reminiscent of 
Alain Resnais' (by comparison crude) 
intercutting of the Hiroshima 
bombing with love scenes in Hiro-
shima, mon amour. The secret of 
Malle's oeuvre is a series of very 
simple shots: the image we can touch 
as the film is touching the object, thtt 
synthesis of all the various levels of 
the movie in a series of tactile images. 

Malle's stories are simple, almost 
cliched: Le Souffle au Coeur (Mur-
mur of the Heart) deals with a young 
man's rites of passage from puberty 
to manhood. But in the images of this 
simple plot, Malle offers a probe into 
emotional, political and intellectual 
crises. Humor is often the centerpiece 
for such observations, for example, 
the ironic, understanding horror on 
the face of the young protagonist 
while a homosexual priest strokes his 
knees, or the apparently brutal slash-
ing of the parents• "adored .. Corot by 
his brother, who has replaced it with 
a fake. 

Watching Malle on the stage, 
unpresum.ing and brilliant, was 
enough to restore my faith in The 
Great Director as well as reinforce my 
prejudices about Yale. Louis Malle 
and his movies are about that simple 
identification of the fictional reality 
with our own; we feel what the 
(usually non-professional) actors feel, 
see what Malle sees, laugh with the 
fated irony of his plots. Perhaps the 
best way to sum up Louis Malle's 
work is with his (improvised, 
according to him) last scene of Le 
Souffle au coeur": slowly, one actor 
after another breaks out laughing 
over a situation that could be 
potentially destructive -
the dis-
covery of the son's affairs. Staged in 
curtain call fashion, their laugh grows 
and grows until it reaches out into the 
audience, without subtracting or 
adding anything, to envelop us.

**Title: Mauling Malle**
**Author: Cina Inamorata**

Mauling Malle 
I have come away from Linsly-
Chittenden thinking Louis Malle is a 
nice man. My friend tells me that he 
looked, nay, glanced (like a search-
light) at me for several seconds this 
evening. Maybe he will make me a 
star. Instead of sleeping tonight I 
shall .think on his white sweater pure 
as virgin snow. 

Louis Malle does not make films 
about incest, lust or anything else 
which might unsettle his public. He is 
a nice man: good-looking, unimagina-
tive and evidently dynamic on the set 
(running about in sweatbands, smok-
ing dope). And he just sort of wishes 
that everyone, everybody together, 
could be good-looking and dynamic 
on the set; mothers and sons, jews 
and nazis ... the works. This simple 
formula may beg too much patience 
from the more intellectually blood-
thirsty of his audience. Perhaps 
someone could be mean to little 
children, someone could be in despair, 
or (HUSH) someone could be ugly. 
But Louis Malle doesn't believe in 
ugliness, he believes in me. 

Lacombe, Lucien and Murmur of 
the Heart, the two films recently 
shown on campus, involve a tricky 
dialectic; the first -
how complicated 
everything is when nothing happens, 
and the second, how simple it is when 
everything happens. From what I 
understand New York critics have 
been going mad with joy. Maybe I 
too would go mad with joy if I were 
being paid to write reviews. I would 
buy a white sweater pure as virgin 
snow instead of the bathrobe my 
grandmother chose. If you had to 
wear the bathrobe your grandmother 
chose you'd be mean too.
