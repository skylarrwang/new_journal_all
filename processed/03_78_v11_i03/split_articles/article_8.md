Head(s) 
by Zimmer Voss 
All around the walls. Thick coffee 
and cream colored wood -
thirty feet 
tall. They looked the color of infant's 
vomit on concrete. 
"It's a shame," I say to Sam, "that 
with all the money spent killing plants 
they end up with these walls the color 
of baby puke." 
"Chartle Chartle," says Sam know-
ingly, that being the way he laughs. 
He laughs the way all of Them in the 
Circle laugh. They all practice it 
together -
between trips to the 
bathroom to compare the sizes of 
their zipper stuffers -
over coffee the 
color of infant's vomit. 
He will quote me in the Column 
tomorrow. He will print my "A 
Shame" as "asha-m." I have told him 
that is the way I think it and that is 
the way it should be printed. I told 
him that the night before when he was 
drunk and I had just put every pill I 
owned in a Vita-Mixer and blended 
the shit out of them. I did it in the 
privacy of Frank's twelfth floor pent-
house. It was Frank's though I'd 
never met him, because he was a 
super rich faggot interior decorator 
with no taste who died. I had 'bought 
it and everything in it. I left it just the 
way it was. I have no need to change 
the world for me. The world changes 
its self for me. The change is not 
voluntary. The world wishes that it 
-didn't have to keep up with me, that 
it could just go off on its own and 
just Be. But that is impossible. If it 
weren't for people like me the world 
would be nothing. It knows that. It 
tries to hide the fact from me. It 
doesn't know that I knew this long 
ago. 

Sam was at a cocktail party to 
honor me. He had gotten bored and 
left. Right away because I wasn't 
there. He found me at the next party 
he went to. Standing alone in the 
corner. I was surrounded by faggots 
and frigid women who had heard 
stories. They eyed my unremarkable 
features with wonder lust. 

The women were impressed by the 
whispered stories. The faggots were 
impressed by their own opinions. 
These were not the people that I 
wanted to impress. 

· I could only at the time think of 
one person that i wanted to impress. 
She is not impressed by any stories or 
opinions that she hears, though she 
believes them all. She knows that 
everything is true. She is impressed by 
nothing. That is why she impresses 
me. 

Sam is drunk and in public. So is 
everyone. 

Except me. I am full of new jersey 
chemicals. A spoon full of them, 
scooped from the pile of rain bowed 
powder in the Vita-Mixer. In p.rivate. 
No one knows. 

Today it is Sunday. They have 
finally gotten around to the source of 
all the excitement. It is nothing by 
itself. 

But I did it. It is now the best. 
They have no idea why. They are 
moved, genuinely moved. That is 
because it is me that moves. They 
stand still. They are on a stationary 
train with no point of reference. I 
move, I am their reference, they are 
genuinely moved, standing stock still, 
eyes leaking in the speeding air. 

I am the best in their standards. 
Their standards have conformed to 
me. She is the best in my standards. 
My standards conform to her. But, 
because no one knows this, my 
standards never change. 

After I tell Sam how to spell 
ashamed, the curious do not under-
stand. 

I look at their smiling, terrified 
faces. They need me to make them 
feel good. To do this my only choice 
is to hurt them. They appreciate my 
talent. They do not understand theirs 
is much better. It is invisible to them. 
They only see what is not there. I 
only see what is. 

Contact. I drill one in the eyes. She 
is screamingly beautiful though she 
looks nothing like the one I am 
destined never to impress. "Don't you 
think, love," (I call everything love, 
it's such an easy word to say.), "that 
there are no men too small, only 
women too big." 

A faggot on the fringe mumbles 
something about Oscar Wilde, made 
braver, no doubt, by his distance from 
me. I want to sneak through the New 
York City Sewer System. Up from the 
river, up through the trunk lines, 
squeezing up through the graduated 
capillaries, all the way up to his 
apartment where I would lunge up 
through his toilet and shove a flame 
thrower up his ass. 

I do not fear albino crocodiles. 
I am unlike anyone I have ever 
known. That is because I am just like 
everyone I've ever met. 

Here we are the morning after. We, 
all of us that make up this fragile, 
twisted, world shaking power system. 
My paintings surround me in the huge 
circle of flat, square walls. In the first 
ring stand the critics experts collectors 
dilettantes and media remorra. They 
look a lot alike. They wear the same 
faces. It doesn't matter who made 
their clothes. No matter if the clothes 
were expensive. Still the being · 
who made them will never wear the 
stupid face of those who wear them. 

There is no second ring. If there 
were, perhaps it would be manned by 
the sweat shop labor. But it is not. If 
it were, they would be just as defense-
less as the first line. 

But then there is me. I have 
absolutely no defenses. I am never on 
the defensive. 

The critics do not look at me. They 
have nothing to say. I don't tell them 
anything, either in my paintings or in 
my press releases. I paint and speak a 
great deal. 

They have pronounced the .collec-
tion an amalgam of masterpieces. The 
artist has come out of nowhere to 
dazzle the world. It is the only thing 
they can say. It is their world that is 
meant. 

The paintings are shades of blue 
with pink outlines. 

The one I wanted to impress 
arrives. 

Sam disappears in a cloud of self-
inflicted insignificance. So do they all. 

She sits down next to me. We don't 
look in each other's eyes. X-ray vision 
startles the brain. 

It has been years since we met. We 
never parted. There was nothing to 
part. 

Sh~ stares straight ahead. She is 
looking at one of the paintings. She 
doesn't survey the room or examine 
closely, the way the others do. She 
just looks. Straight ahead. Her only 
mistake is that she is looking at 
another's work. It is a painting that I 
don't remember doing. That doesn't 
really matter. I don't remember doing 
any of them. 

She nods. I smile and watch her 
nod. She was small and light and 
dirty as tar. But the dirty part was the 
part you couldn't see. At twenty she 
could have been the girl on the box of 
Ivory Snow. 1 wanted her then. I 
would stand at my window and 
scream for her. But never out loud. 
That is foolish. I knew it intuitively, 
even then. I remember my incarna-
tions. That is the only recall that 
works. That is my advantage. 

She is now dirty on the outside. 
She talked it so long that it oozed like 
puss spittle out of her mouth and 
across the virgin fiber of her armor. 
Her hair hangs down in cottony 
swatches of chemical elegance. It is 
full of squeaky filth. It is now the 
color of dried blood. Her face has 
been re-upholstered poorly. 

She says that I have done a good 
job. She has no perception of how 
accurate she is. Only I do and th,at 
doesn't count. 

She has spent her life looking at 
paintings, studying paintings, copying 
paintings, talking of paintings, 
theorizing about paintings. She has 
been painting since she was six. She is 
slowly starving to death. 

I have studied people. I painted 
three months. I started with that one 
over there and finished with that one 
over there. I ran out of blue. 

She talks but her words are for 
herself. Everyone's are. Except mine. 
Mine are for God. God is blind. He 
doesn't see all, rather, he hears all. I 
tell him what he wants to hear. 

She says she dreams of paintings. 
I say that's the difference between 
us. 

I wake up exhausted with a picture 
in my head. I draw it.
