Layaway for Judgment Day 
by Aaron Betsky 
The scales of justice are held by 
Liz, open-eyed clerk of the Superior 
Court of New Haven. She sits in her 
glass booth on the ninth floor of the 
Court Building on Church Street and 
controls the entrance to the jury 
elevator. Her captive audience (in the 
form of several hundred bored citi-
zens) sits around her waiting for the 
crackle of the intercom, which Liz 
relinquishes four or five times a day 
to one of the sheriffs ... Numbers 808, 
2357, 2368, 2418 ... " As the numbers 
are called out, corresponding faces 
Light up, sigh, or return to their 
waiting, reading and needlepoint. 
Those called will form the basis for a 
jury, lost somewhere in the entrails of 
this large building or the criminal 
court across the street, pronouncing 
judgment on their peers. The captive 
citizens ar~ engaged in an exercise of 
patience and aggravation called Jury 
Duty. 

Most people are not alarmed when 
they receive the first notice from the 
court system that they have their 
number. Only when they open the 
mail and find that four weeks of their 
Life is going down the drain of public 
responsibility in support of the law . 
schools do they start to curse, connive 
and generally work: themselves out of 
this God-given right. They do this 
with varying degrees of success. I was 
one who lost. 

I showed up at the courthouse early 
one Monday morning in my best 
clothes, secure in the knowledge that I 
was a smart-ass Yalie, not a real 
townie. For an hour, the roll call was 
taken. For an hour, we watched a 
movie on jury duty QOt unlike those 
shown to snickering audiences in sex 
ed or driver ed. The Honorable Judge 
Aaronson lectured us for half an 
hour. For an, hour, I waited, until it 
was finally my turn to whisper my 
confession to the judge: that I was a 
Yalie, unacceptable and with many 
obligations. The wearied judge wiped 
his forehead, told me about the 
importance of youth and intelligence, 
and let me off with a two-week: 
sentence. Stunned, I retreated to my 
Dean in search of pity, but Mother 
Eli was helpless. So I told my teachers 
to behave and took: off for my two-
week stint. 

The view from the ninth floor is 
actually quite magnificent. From the 
large Assembly Room, you can look 
through three large circular windows 
out to the golden New Haven harbor 
and the Sound, or to the hills rolling 
out to Sleeping Giant. From the 
various lounges, Yale and Downtown 
stretch out in all their urban might. I 
chose a lounge from which I could see 
my neo-Gothic home, the classrooms 
I should have been in, the library I 
should have been buried in, the bed I 
should have been sleeping in. But Liz 
watches my every movement at the 
elevator, tells me when to come and 
when to go, dispenses proofs of 
attendance, allows favors. One ab-
sence could cost me $50. So I am 
confmed to the dirty, yellow-and-
white lounges, the air filled with 
heavy smoke, tbe temperature in the 
eighties. Card games, puzzles flourish, 
pieced together by changing bands. 
Knitting and talking transcend old 
ladies; .. My tongue is so tired, it really 
hurts," exclaims one worried woman 
at the end of the day. Forced together 
unnaturally, a representative cross-
section of the population of Southern 
Connecticut must spend sixteen days 
together in close contact, forming an 
extended family. Jury Duty is waiting, , 
becoming a peer among peers. 

I have unconsciously chosen, along 
with my lounge with a view of Yale, a 
group of fellow waiters. Barbara is a 
school teacher in West Haven. Bill is 
an industrial engineer. Janet, a sec-
retary, Bunny, a key-punch operator. 
Bill is retired, John unknown, small 
and intently interested in everything. 
Sidney is the mystery, of unknown 
profession, quick, the cynical card 
player. Several minor players fill the 
fringes of the room, sometimes enter-
ing the conversation. The conver-
sation is aimless, searching. Barbara 
and I discuss education. "It's the 
toughest job in town," she says, 
adjusting her glasses. "They're just not 
keeping to basics anymore," she 
smoothes her skirt, "no discipline." 
She discusses the trouble finding 
substitutes, the glut in the teacher 
market; I drift away. Her manner is 
easy, stem, I close my eyes and sec: 
my high school German teacher. Bill 
is also worried about education. about 
the quality of life. They discuss West 
Haven. Barbara is missing her vaca-
tion for this, Bill just his salary. The 
state pays $10 a day, plus JOe a mile. 
"That just about covers the cost of my 
sweat up here." People wonder 
whether to have lunch, discuss brands 
of cigarettes. The other Bill doesn't 
mind the duty. He gets a chance to 
work on his needle point. He is 
embroidering orange flowers. He 
frames the works himself, hangs them 
or sells them. He has another hobby 
as well. The next day, he produces 
slides and samples of his work, 
carefully ignoring the oohs and ahhs. 
There are mostly partridges and other 
birds of the woods, painstakingly 
painted on canvas or on clay models 
in woodland colors. A UConn student 
intrudes into our snug group, tries to 
talk about Whitman with me, telling 
me the others are not students. The 
others compare houses, places of 
work, addresses, friends, tell stories. 
"You know, there was this girl, came 
to work at the office, never said 
anything to anyone. Turned out, she 
had this problem, you know, but she 
didn't dare tell it to anyone, you 
know, she was sort of ashamed." 
"That's the way it is, these people 
with problems ... " I feel very 
problematic. 

As the days drag on, we try and 
remember the chant the ftlm gave us, 
repeated over and over again: "He 
who waits also serves ... he who 
waits also serves." We sit and wait, 
trying to amuse each other. After a 
while, you long to be called. Then: 
"2609 ... " A jump up, a wait. I enter 
the elevator, face new faces in silence, 
step off in a floor, white corridors in 
office light. We wait in little rooms, 
not Icnowing what will happen to us. 
The thought of judgment lurks in our 
minds, somewhere. We are ushered 
into a small courtroom, no windows, 
stylized furniture and the bright 
American flag, bidden fluorescent 
lights. The judge instructs us. The 
case seems somewhat byzantine: a 
the new journal, March 3, 1978 
mother, daughter and two friends are 
suing the son and brother for a car 
accident that happened five years ago; 
it slowly emerges that Hertz is a co-
defendant, that they are paying the 
lawyer. Five impatient, black faces 
scan the twenty-four members of the 
panel, until we are led out so that 
questioning of the jurors can begin. 
The plaintiffs lawyer bas frizzy hair 
wears a green tie and green suit with a 
yellow-grey shirt. He is overweight. 
The defense attorney wears a J. Press 
suit, has a classically chiseled New 
England face and smiles at the jury 
over his Ben Franklins. This could be 
tough. We ftle out, wait interminably, 
twelve blank faces facing each other 
and the empty SNETCO offices 
across the way. Finally, we are called 
in again. The case has been settled out 
of court, as most cases are. Relieved 
and disappointed we reascend our 
lofty perch overlooking New Haven. 
The next day presents a repeat.of 
the same procedure. Same number 
called, same courthouse. The steno-
grapher looks at us, bored, chewing 
gum with her mouth open. At the 
meat depot on Long Wharf, one 
worker had attacked another and 
caused him grievous bodily injury, for 
which he wants money. Jurors are 
actually called. Some are taken, some 
rejected. The tension in our little 
waiting room rises. A nationalized 
French woman complains about the 
government, everywhere and on all 
levels. "They don't care, they treat 
you like this. You know nothing. 
They know it all Just power, that's 
all, we elect them, and they get the 
money, and that's all they care." 
There is much agreement in the room. 
John and I discuss Washington and 
the allurements of power until John is 
called and, after half an hour of 
questioning, accepted. I too am called, 
after several more have been accepted 
or rejected. The first question from 
that same chiseled defense lawyer: Am 
I still at Yale. Yes. Oh yes. Do I 
believe that it is just to demand 
money in return for bodily harm? 
Trying to wipe the nervous smile off 
my face, I answer that, given the 
present structure of our society and 
the importance of money in it, I think 
money is as fair a reward for harm to 
your body as any. I am excused after 
this question. 

So goes the procedure, running 
through the mill, sometimes falling 
through it into a jury, or else stepping 
off for a while until we have a chance 
to run a couple of laps and get a 
glimpse of justice. Back upstairs, we 
play our own games now, and they 
make the days go quickly. Sidney, our 
favorite wheeler-dealer, runs the 
games. Dealing the cards for five-card 
stud, he talks of his vacation in 
Vegas, of the Arabs there. "They're 
buying up everything. What's money 
to them? They just pump it out. Sit 
down at the table. be says, this Sheik:, 
I drop couple hundred thousand. 
Nothing to them. The English own 
the Mall down here, know that? Sure, 
sure ... " Time flies, as monopoly-
money changes hands, greed comes 
out and disappears. We play 
monopoly, poker, learning new tricks 
and variations. We propose to ask the 
judges to join us up here. Our comer 
has become a hideout for decadence, 
full of smoke, gambling, risque jokes 
and even an occasional four letter 
word puncturing the eardrums of the 
silent ladies in the far comer of the 
lounge. I tried to work here, but gave 
it up. Fiercely, rm trying to unload 
Baltic. The jokes come quick, leaden.
