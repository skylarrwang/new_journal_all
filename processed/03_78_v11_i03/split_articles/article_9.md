"Aaron, you get so involved, so 
intense," Bunny says. Ah, shucks. 
And so the days wear on, the 
puzzles become clearer, the dealing of 
the hands faster, smoke and drab 
colors become a drab backdrop for 
the unfolding of time, the presence of 
the intercom intermittently blaring. At 
lunch or five, we all gather in front of 
the elevators like a herd of cattle in a 
corral, waiting to be let out. Barbara 
has been called to the Criminal Court 
across the street, a feared place of real 
decisions and hard chairs in a 
practically windowless room. We were 
just in the middle of a two- to three-
hour discussion of our vacations in 
Europe when the loss came. Sidney 
finished his story of the medieval meal 
he had in Ireland, and then we switch 
back to poker. Bill and John ask me 
to identify the various parts of Yale, 
which I do gladly, pointing from the 
window at Sterling, Branford, the 
gym. We talk of children,Â· their tricks 
and fears. We lose Janet to a trial, 
but not her monopoly board. The day 
goes quickly. 

I am called again the next day, to a 
different court. A tenant is suing his 
landlord because he slipped on some 
steps hanging his wife's wash. The 
judge jokes with the attorneys, we 
wear stony masks. We wait in our 
little rooms, talk about Carter. 
Nobody likes him. Slowly, a jury is 
called together. In the end, there are 
only five people left in both rooms. 
Four of us are excused. The routine is 
by now familiar. The week is over, 
and I look forward to not having to 
get up at nine in the morning. 

The snowstorm keeps us apart for. 
most of the week. I find myself 
missing the decadent idleness, the 
security of inactivity on the ninth 
floor, the companionship of people 
who will never know each other. I 
know the homes and gardens a nd 
neighborhoods of five people, I know 
of Bill's tennis games, of the other 
Bill's painting and his passionate 
hobbies, the fineness of his hands. I 
know John's political attitudes, I 
know Barbara's frustration, Sidney's 
mysteriously financed vacations in 
plaid pants and Hawaiian shirts. They 
know about my courses, my interest 
in architecture, my youth in Europe. I 
took Bunny and Janet to Claire's 
where they were totally astonished: 
"I've never had an avocado, and I 
don't plan to. You know, I could 
never get my husband in here. Never." 
They are astonished at Syrian bread, 
and I am ashamed to have brought 
them here, bewildered by their reac-
tions. After lunch, they go off to the 
Mall, and I go off to Yale. The last 
afternoon, on Friday, I talk to Bill 
and Sidney about being a student. "If 
you ask me, it's mucho money for 
nothing," Sidney says, "no jobs. 
Forget it." "I'll find something," I say. 
"If I didn't think that, I wouldn't be 
at Yale. I have faith I can make 
myself a life." Sidney shrugs. "It's a 
great school, though," Bill says. We 
talk about various relatives at dif-
ferent colieges. I am called suddenly, 
two hours before it's all over. I stand 
up in the Jury Box, and ask the J udge 
to be excused. He releases me and 
eight others. Several people thank me 
for asking him. It was a dull traffic 
case, anyhow. We go back upstairs, 
where the remnants of the group, 
Bunny, Bill and John, are sitting 
silently. We don't really have much 
more to say, it is the last day, after 
all. I start on a .puzzle, and frantically 
start piecing together windows and 
door, trying to get something coherent 
before the intercom crackles for the 
last time. Some impatient ladies are 
discussing Liz, angry at what they 
think is her arbitrary use of power. 
"She just loves it, like all of us," one 
half-whispers to another. Finally, she 
speaks: "O.k., five, you're all excused 
for the week. For those of you that 
are leaving us today, I'd like to say 
that it's been nice knowing you, 
you're really a nice bunch. Take care 
of yourselves, now." I say a very 
hurried goodbye, rush to the elevator, 
ride down silently, smiling. Outside, 
the traffic is absolutely jammed. I'm 
the only pedestrian, and feel apolo-
getic that I'll actually be home in ten 
minutes. It's all over. 

I did not get a single chance to 
judge in these two weeks, as is the
case with many people. The system of 
justice seems closer, but still foreign 
to me. I feel like a traitor, pretending 
to be a citizen of New Haven. But for 
two weeks we were all traitors, 
pretending to be one large extended 
family, deriving an identity from the 
little blue buttons we wear. We are 
constituent parts of this manipulated 
court system, but we are innocent. In 
our innocence, we knew each other, 
we tried each other. We have per-
formed our true civic duty: we have 
sat side by side, and talked, and 
waited.
