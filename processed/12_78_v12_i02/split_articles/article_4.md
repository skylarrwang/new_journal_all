Jackaroo: 
I met an Australian couple in the 
Lake District in England a couple of 
weeks before leaving for Australia. I 
told them of my plans and the woman 
gave me three things to look out for: 
sun, dust and flies. I found all three .. I 
asked the cook my first day about the 
heat, hoping to have my fears allayed. 
He told me to cover my body or rd 
burn severely ... No one stands in this 
sun for more than thirty minutes, 
Eddie, you bum." I had six months of 
nine-hour workdays coming up. I had 
committed myself to being a jackaroo 
before being a freshman. 

I rode into Perth. The sky was 
bright blue and Perth was spotless, 
green parks, flowers and beautifully 
quiet. I spent a day there, my intro-
duction to Western Australia, then 
flew to Esperance. As we circled the 
airstrip I scanned the flat, green 
landscape. Tiny white spots 
scampered away as we buzzed by. 
Sheep, my companions for six 
months. Nearby the ocean was clear 
blue, smooth and alluring. Esperance 
itself is stark, flat land that has either 
been cleared for grazing or cropping 
or has been left untouched; virgin 
land. In Esperance, I could see the 
horizon forming and the sky stretched 
over the fields, making me feel small. 
Zooming around 300-acre paddocks 
on a motorcycle in the sweet smelling 
heat, herding sheep, I didn't need 
college -
I didn't want college. The 
farm was quiet, unstructured, slow-
paced -
everything life in America is 
not. Where was I? On a sheep farm in 
Australia twenty hours on a plane 
away from home, but it seemed 
farther than that, so foreign was the . 
landscape. The forests and mountains · 
of home were in another space 
entirely, completely out of mind. 

My most serene moments came in 
the early morning and evening. I was 
up at six nearly every workday. I rose 
easily, feeling sore from the previous 
day, but not reluctant. I would grab a 
two-gallon pail and walk across a 
small field to the milking shed, where 
the cows and their full udders waited. 
At that hour, no one else was awake. 
The sun was just rising and I felt 
exhilarated, not knowing the world 
could be so still and bright. In the 
evenings I took long walks. When the 
sky had been clear during the day, the-
stars would dot the night in all direc-
tions, making me feel as if I were on 
the middle of a pincushion. 

But during the day the heat was 
like the blueness of the sky -
always 
there. It seared our backs and soaked 
us with sweat. At the beginning of a 
day, we would sense how hot it would 
feel. Before lunch, a hot wind would 
often sweep down on us from the 
northern deserts. Lips would dry and 
the sheep would be reluctant to move. 
If we were working closely with the 
sheep, it became especially trying. 

My first days, we were busy jetting 
sheep. This, I learned, meant forcing 
them through a narrow walkway. A 
horizontal series of bars was pressed 
aside as each sheep walked through, 
triggering a spraying mechanism. The 
chemical would prevent, for a few 
short ~lc:s, flies from laying eggs on 
them. 

One week I was part of a conver-
sation which left me shaken. Peter, a 
fellow jackaroo, turned to another 
one· of us and asked: "Has Ed killed 
his first sheep yet?" Ed said to 
himself, with a mixed expression of 
disbelief and surprise, .. He's joking, 
right?" Then, out loud: .. What d'ya 
mean -
why kill them?" "We eat 
mutton out here. Ever have mutton?" 
I began phrasing arguments in my 
head. Can't stand blood. That's it! 
Hopelessly squeamish. Maybe a little 
fainting would do the trick. Or how 
about the philosophical approach: 
preservation of life, inhumanity, 
cruelty to future lamb chops ... ? I 
tucked these forensic gems aside and 
glossed the discussion over with a 
laugh. Maybe they'd forget ... 

The following week, my initiation 
took place. Chris and I drove to the 
paddock of ration sheep or "killers," 
selected three, tied their legs and 
brought them to the killing block. In 
clinical fashion, Greg and Chris each 
demonstrated their styles, discussing 
fine points (removal of bladder, 
snapping of forelegs) as they went. 
Then it was my turn. I didn't want to 
do·this, and the pathetic, shaking 
sheep didn't like the vibrations either. 
All I could see was one of its eyes 
staring at me. It began to bleat, and I 
thought I could hear my name: 
"Eheehd ... Eeehed." An hour and a 
half later I was covered with blood 
and fat, panting and finished. By the 
end of six months, I would do it in 
fifteen minutes. 

A month later, hay carting began, 
tlie most physically exacting job I did .. 
The hay had been cut, raked and 
baled. Now we were to collect the 
5,000 odd bales and create two huge 
stacks. One drove the truck, a second 
grabbed the bale as it came flying up 
the elevator and the third would stack 
the bales on the truck's boarded floor. 
My first time out produced sore 
shoulders, blistered hands and a new 
conception of the word hot. The straw 
dust blew its way through my long 
sleeve shirt and blue jeans, making me 
itch. But the steady rhythm of lift, 
place, lift, place would soon take 
hold, and the smooth, soothing sea 
breeze would seep in, blowing back 
the hot winds. 

In January we put the rams in. 
Backing the covered truck against a 
hill, we would release thirty of them 
to attend to a flock of 600 ewes. This 
happened once a year for these 
horned beauties and when you let 
them off, they ran. A month later, we 
returned to reverse things, using 
motorcycles and the ever-present 
dogs. There were three of us: Mike, 
Colin and I. The other two had dogs. 
This left one of us to wade through 
the sheep, grab the unhappy rams and 
drag them back onto the truck. The 
rams knew what was going on. They 
watched me from the comers of their 
eyes and shifted nervously. The dogs 
themselves were perhaps more 
valuable than I was. They could run 
faster, understood instructions well, 
didn't crash into fences and always 
did as they were told. They only 
respond to one person: Until you run 
down a sheep in the middle of a 
paddock you can't realize what an 
uset these srriall pups could be. They 
•ode on the back of the Land Rovers 
and, on command, would jump off 
and wrestle down a sheep pointed to. 
They'd bring a mob down a hill and 
run them in a circle for us to inspect 
or push them up a race to be counted 
and cured. And they did it all for a 
can of ground pseudo-meat. 

I had less luck with horses and 
cows. The former were too big and I 
didn't like their eyes. Like the rams, 
they understood too much. When it 
came down to it, I didn't want to hop 
on the back of one, but the inevitable 
occurred after two weeks of anxiety. 
We steered the lucky five horses into 
a small pen. Chris hopped on his bare 
back. Bareback! Amazed, I moved 
hesitantly toward Duke, my mount. 
He eyed me knowingly. Be a good 
poker player, I thought. I walked with 
my saddle, which I handled like an 
amateur. Duke didn't want me, and I 
wasn't too happy about crawling on 
top of him either. Luckily, the 
confrontation was delayed for a few 
days. We were to round up cattle and 
herd them across a stock route to 
another paddock. I was riding Duke 
again. Mike left for a few minutes, 
telling me to saddle up and wait. I 
was feeling cocky by this time, since a 
couple of uneventful weelc.s of riding 
left me thinking I could do it easily. I 
hopped on and scanned the horizon. 
Ah! life in the outback. Then, I saw 
three stray bead o' cattle in the 
corner. I set off, in a canter. Then 
Duke, quiet, peaceful Duke, the horse 
they gave to green city boys, bolted, 
just took off at full gallop. My foot 
immediately slipped a stirrup and my 
attempts to pull up Duke fell 
ridiculously short .- leaving me 
scared sbitless. Duke began a sweep-
ing turn back toward the fence. At 
this point, my thoughts bad no 
coherence. Somehow I thought that 
the horse would jump the fence -
quite a trick at that speed. Instead, he 
abruptly pulled himself out of his 
hellish run ten yards from the fence. 
His momentum threw me headlong, 
and I landed at the foot of the fence. 
Too white and trembling to be angry, 
I got up and shook my arms. 

My easiest job was when I had to 
take care of Stan. Stan was the 
exceptional ram. $1 1,000 worth of 
horns, fleece and, it was hoped, 
semen. Stan was housed alone and 
indoors, hand fed and watered, given 
~very privilege a well-born young ram 
should have. These included an 
unlimited sexual life ... Family" was 
the mob of 200 ewes that Stan 
fathered. Unlike the other rams, 
though, Stan had individual ewes 
brought into his pen, sometimes 
unwillingly. We wrote the ear tag 
number of each ewe in the stud book 
and waited for Stan to deliver an 
$11,000 screw . . 

When I first saw my fellow jacks 
and a stockman kick and throw sheep 
around I was disgusted and appalled. 
Their insensitivity was incredible, I 
thought. Then I wondered if I would 
become that way by the time I left. Is 
this. what my experience wilt mean to 
m.e? Traditionally, jacks are the worst 
offenders when it comes to this sort of 
irresponsible behavior. I watched the 
others, though, and noticed that both 
overseers and the stockman, Peter (an 
egregious offender) would often do a 
number on an uncooperative sheep. 
Greg Bannon, the manager, never did, 
though. He had a sardonic life view, 
an easygoing manner, and he seemed 
above our fits of pique. I retract the 
word .. never," however. Once he, 
Chris and I were selecting rams to be 
trucked to another stud farm. Greg 
was handling each animal's balls in an 
effort to judge its breeding potential. I 
enjoyed work that day -
Greg was in 
good humor. Then one ram refused to 
remain quiet and still. Greg cursed 
and, grabbing it by the horns, flipped 
the ram on its back roughly. Chris 
and 1 exchanged glances. Ah -
even 
Greg loses it sometimes. 

In December, the Australian 
summer begins to peak. The bright 
green fields become brown, dusty and 
dry. The little yellow flowers shrivel 
and vanish. I wondered how the sheep 
stayed alive, having so little to eat. I 
would wander about the beaches. 
Only twice did I find more than five 
people walking on the sand. I could 
swim alone, jumping from the chunks 
of granite into cold, shining water. 
The days became hot and bright, and 
continued t• rJag.
