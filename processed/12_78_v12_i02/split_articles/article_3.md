Fragmentary lntrodul'lions 
A slickly crammed eye, peering out 
on 59th St. between Park and 
Lexington, with a loud madly 
coloured labyrinthine brain stretching 
behind. Fiorucci. a store. 

An elongated face, mummified by 
strips of colour, blinking under 
pulsing light; bobby-soxed feet boxed 
into platform sandals. Fiorucci. a 
salesgirl. 

A dark young punk. arabesque 
smile dreaming on his face, perches a 
half-!lobe of yellow plastic on his 
acrobatic hair. Fiorucci. a shopper. 

A thin ellipse of the female genre 
high-steps adroitly. gleaming in the 
mirrors. blissful eyes smiling. 
Fiorucci. a cruiser. 

A Story 
Elio Fiorucci speaks: "Freedom is 
the most important thing. People 
must unlearn arbitrary and capricious 
rules and follow their own unbounde( 
spirits ... 

Fiorucci began in 1967. in Milan. 
The concept behind the store has not 
changed. he says: it is meant to be a 
gallery. a meeting-place. a refuge. an 
intelligent business overflowing with 
brilliantly-coloured witty or witless 
gadgets. accessories and clothes. A 
jim place: music insistently ber7.erk. 
colours leaping out of corners like 
cra7cd animals. roaring neon. Fiorucc 
says he wanted to break the rules of 
fashion. to propose a life-style and a 
persona that would trash and clash 
with neat middle-class tastes. The 
emphasis in the design of the store is 
on colour and space and movement: 
the clothes arc moved almost daily. 
the trinkets pop precariously from 
counters. hombastic graphics hlast 
across walls. Fiorucci persistently 
uttcmpts to avoid permanence. prc-
dictahility. horedom. Otherwise. their 
market would vanish. Buyers comb 
not only Europe hut also Thailand. 
Hong Kong. Taiw:m. and Japan for 
:.mything that will he hmsh. new. and 
l>alcahlc. However. most of the major

that alter two weeks. the idea is stale 
and old already. The item is then 
consumed in a few days and thrown 
out, even. it seems. if it sells 
remarkably well. Pants are an 
exception: they are not exactly cheap 
and are not meant to be. With respect 
to the glittering pinked-out and 
redded-in accessories. the themes are 
kitsch Miami Beach: palm trees. 
UFO's. pin-ups. cherubs. propellor 
planes.

The Rest of the Story 
"We are not Saint Laurent. .. 
concedes Angelo Careddu. Fashion 
laughing at its own presumption. 
perhaps. for people who want to 
make witty flings at solid and sturdy 
quality clothes that people \\car in 
banks. That image has stra~ed and 
become stable in the fashion world. 
Elio Fiorucci's clothes are not only 
worn to discos. All sorts of types 
wander and flit around in them. 
jading an eye (mine). "hich becomes 
unamused b\' all this tiresome cQlour. 
manufactured and stamped humour. 
Most of the clothes are made of 
cotton alone. or mixes of artificial 
fabrics. Highly flammable stuff. Th~ 
image of tacky clothes and accesso.nes 
has become a paradox. Like all agmg 
re\ olutionaries. Fiorucci wants to 
insist on the essential quality of its 
items. It now wants to use more 
wools and other fabrics that lasr -
while keeping up the glittering 
pretense of momentary splendour. 
amid \Oiatile whips and swaths ot 
colour. 

Fiorucci·s ofticial philosophy is to

those "ho are deemed. in a boring
