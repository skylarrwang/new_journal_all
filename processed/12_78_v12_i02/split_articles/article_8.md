EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
When is a New Woman Not a New Woman?
New Woman magazine bills itself as "a digest for the woman of the Seventies." It should specify which century it represents. Although the slogan presumably refers to the present decade, the articles, ads, and attitudes expressed are basically as sexist and degrading as any published long before female suffrage, much less women's liberation.


The table of contents for the December, 1978 issue reinforces the magazine's schizophrenia - it dedicates itself to the independent "new woman," but is convinced that she needs a man to make her happy. "Are You Overly Concerned with the Opinions of Others?" and "How Popular are You?" cannot both appeal to the same new woman. "Are You Capable of Sexual Beauty?" follows an article stressing, "The key to sexual beauty is to go beyond the sense of sight," and suggesting "we get out of the Playboy environment." But the magazine has a monthly feature called "Reducing," and gives a painful but supposedly very effective method for removing cellulite (apply boiling water and ice cubes to the skin) in another section called "Doctor's Office." Be happy with your body and disregard those gorgeous models, says one article, while others tell you how to become one of those skin-deep beauties.


Under the liberated woman-type heading Successful Living New Woman presents the article, "If You Want to Meet Men." Its feminist conviction, "Your worth as a human being does not depend upon your popularity nor upon any man's reaction to you," would provide a welcome note of liberation if the article did not elsewhere promise, "Just five principles hold the key to scientific man-meeting. Once incorporated into your thinking, these put man-meeting within your control." "Yes, now you can develop the kind of magnetic attractiveness and sex appeal that excites and arouses others the moment you walk into a room ... thanks to the great new mind-reprogramming book called Inner Looks." Although these two mind-control quotes seem to be from the same article, the second one is actually part of the blurb for the $7.95 book Inner Good Looks advertised on the opposite page. Inner Good Looks promises a "sure fire way to get others to fantasize about you sexually," and is "unconditionally guaranteed to improve your good looks in two weeks."


Mind over body - to diet, to glow, and to arouse. Is this what a truly liberated woman would waste her brain power on - feeling good about herself just so others will too, hopefully men?


Of course! claims New Woman in another two articles called "Relating to Others," and "Relating to a Lover." Both stress advertising your true self while being a good listener, empathetic, and quiet about your own problems because your friends and lovers "have enough of their own."


What happens if the woman who wants a relationship happens to be impatient or troubled? Mind over personality, of course. Although the author advises that "to misrepresent yourself is a waste of time, because any relationship evolving from such a meeting will be in big trouble when the real you is discovered," he directly contradicts himself later saying you must act a certain way to make and keep friends, whether you feel comfortable that way or not.


"Can you buy friendship? You not only can, you must," emphasizes the "Relating to Others/ a Lover" author. "Every person has needs. When you fill one or more of those needs, you're paying for someone's friendship." But, the author warns a page later in bold type, "Friends won't respect you for trying to be unselfish." You're out for yourself, honey, so grab some friends and be sympathetic, but not for their sake; and be yourself, but only if you're an angel on the make.


If you're a liberated woman on the make (and after all, aren't all new women horny, hedonistic, husband-hunters?), remember that "If you want to be liked - and loved," you cannot "keep yourself - your real self - in hiding." Dr. George Weinberg, author of the article "If You Want to be Liked - and Loved," says that you must also enjoy life. Never mind that the "you must enjoy yourself" attitude is the basic American guilt trip as defined by Martha Wolfenstein in her essay "Fun Morality." For others to like you and for you to like yourself you must, as the New Woman author stresses, "get involved in as much as you can in the world around you," and enjoy it, goddammit. While Wolfenstein says this indoctrination makes us less able to enjoy life and hence guilt-ridden, New Woman says it makes us more us. While Wolfenstein says this reduces our pleasure play to a duty, New Woman thinks this is not the case, and that we do it to please ourselves. The fact that the magazine insists that to be liked - and loved we must do it, however, proves that we are living and enjoying life for someone else in the hopes that she or he will love us for it. "To be liked, don't try to please others," says the author hypocritically after eight tips on how to win friends and influence people which seem almost lifted from Dale Carnegie.


When you are finished or tired of winning and influencing new lovers and likers, perhaps it is time to turn to your own spouse. Dale Carnegie includes a section on domestic tranquility, why should New Woman be any different? "What can YOU do to make your relationship better?" is the unlikely lead sentence in an article titled "Fighting Fulfills a Function for Staying Together." You must "make yourself more attractive and thus make working at the relationship easier for him."


With this advice the New Woman goes beyond Dale Carnegie's sycophancy to Maribel Morgan's sick Total Woman-ism. Just as Maribel suggests each wife greet her husband with a kiss and a compliment every evening when he comes home, New Woman exemplifies "Judy, an elementary school teacher," who, when her husband "came in the door after work each day would give him a kiss, smile, and say, 'Hi, handsome.' No matter how she felt." Italics. New Woman's. This same article later admonishes "the woman who regularly 'fakes' orgasm to please her mate," because she is "not solving their sexual problem but preventing it from being solved." Why should she fake joy and lust in the front hallway, but not in the bedroom? Because she is a new woman, buffetting between liberation and subservience.


Obviously New Woman's advertisers realize the reader's fantasies, because over one-third of the ads are for beauty, fashion, and general man-catching aids; including make-up kits, jewelry, clubs, and individually prepared Natal Horoscopes which "can bring you love, romance, and improve your Life." The other ads sell cigarettes (for the independent woman look), convenient contraceptives (for the independent woman who proves her liberation through "spontaneity"), and liquid paper (for the independent secretary). To be fair, they also advertise insurance, liquor, and New Woman subscriptions.


The new woman herself is a female without well-defined feminist or anti-feminist convictions. Appearances are all that count for her. If she seems independent, self-confident, and well-adjusted, that serves her purposes just as well as if she really were. If she says she is liberated, she is, and with that out of the way, she is free to continue chasing men, youth, and beauty with unabated ardor. The happy ending she dreams of could be Cinderella's - she wants to find a man who will love her and take her away from her forced self-reliance. She can go it alone if she must, but she'd really rather not. Hence she is willing to play with her face, clothes, personality, and values to snag a man. Labeling herself as liberated is just another ploy - maybe if she flirts with independence as well as men, they will find her more attractive.


"The more you realize that there is more to life than men - the more men you will have in your life," the article "So You Want to Meet Men" explains. Since meeting men is the object of the article to begin with, clearly the "more to life" is insignificant once the new woman has attained her goal and secured a male.


So, come on, new woman. Prove yourself - desirable. Show us what you've got - up front. Come out of the closet - into the bedroom. And burn your bra - he'll think that's cute.
