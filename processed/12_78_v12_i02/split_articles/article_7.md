One wonders how well the field of architecture has weathered the twentieth century. The overwhelming move towards technology has created an environment littered with memorials to function, economy, and formalism. Recently, however, the images of technology have lost their ability to excite, and the axiom "Form follows Function" is less mighty than it once was. It seems society was not prepared for an aesthetic lacking ambiguity, complexity, or a sense of humor.


The more recent past has witnessed the resurgence of a more humanistic approach to architecture. Post-modernism, a catch-all phrase for the growing number of current styles, has opened the profession to a re-evaluation of its aging dogmas. Most popular among these trends is an increasing interest in eclecticism. The icons of the past are an attractive alternative to the stark brutality of the present. But eclecticism seems strangely out of place in a society based on suburbs, shopping centers, automobiles, and technology.


SITE, Inc., of New York, tias been dealing with some of these problems since its conception in 1970. Aware of the growing-pains of the architectural profession, a group of artists, headed by James Wines, began looking closely at the role of architecture and public art in today's society. Two problems became clear: the inability of architecture to communicate to more than a handful of members of our society and the fissure which has grown between the arts and architecture.


Originally concerned with large scale public sculpture, SITE (for Sculpture In The Environment) became interested in the iconographic possibilities of architecture. The SITE group realized the impact that changes in the traditionally perceived built world could have if buildings were treated less as designed objects and more as a vehicle for social commentary. They postulated that if the accepted axiom that architectural form should relate to internal function was minimized, architecture could communicate to a much wider range of society. For SITE, the continuity between outside and inside is of little importance; the external influences of the social and cultural context are the dominant factors in their work.


Contrary to the great percentage of present day architectural thought, SITE's ideas evolve from the outside in, freeing the facade of the building to inform or comment.


SITE's most widely known work is a series of buildings for Best Products Company, a catalogue-showroom merchandiser. The first project for the Best Company was completed in 1972. To an existing box-like structure, SITE added a brick veneer facade with peeling corners, giving the building a feeling of tentativeness and instability - the facade ln<?ks as if it is falling off the building. Rather than a static piece of architecture, the building is shown in a state of flux, either in_ a period of growth or decay.


In 1975, S ITE designed the "Indeterminate Facade," another Best building for Houston, Texas. The building, located in a typical suburban shoppingÂ·area, was given a brick face which extended above the roofline. The top of the facade was arbitrarily chipped away, leaving a ragged brick edge. At one point, the facade was fragmented to allow a cascade of bricks to fall over the entrance canopy. Here again, the idea of architecture in the process of becoming or reducing changes our perception of building. This ambiguity establishes a discontinuity between what we perceive and what we already consider as valid.


ln the NOTCH project, a corner of the typical white brick box was cut away. The remaining notch was fixed to a rail system incised into the pavement so that it could be added or subtracted from the building. This fragmented notch moves forty feet out from the building to expose the entrance. Within the standard shopping center context, SITE has changed our subconscious perception of the environment by changing very little of the actual physical reality. In the case of NOTCH, fragmentation has led to the addition of meaning.


In the latest project, TILT, the entire masonry block facade is casually tilted to reveal the in_side of the building. In an environment of strict linearity, the use of a precariously tilted facade establishes a visual dialogue between what we know, the traditional shopping center, and what we perceive, the plane of brick unexpectedly lifted from the building. Such a casual comment forces a questioning of both the perceived and the accepted.


SITE treats the building as a found object, changing the formal aspects of the structure only slightly. A peeling facade, the addition of a cascade of bricks, the subtraction of a corner, or the casual tilting of a facade are seemingly simple devices accomplished with an economy of-means. The interior of their buildings function under the same grid pattern as most other large shopping centers, allowing the owners to use the space as they wish. However, by using the skin of the building as a vehicle for art, SITE allows us to reevaluate our perception of the environment. In this way, the questions which these buildings generate both enrich and strengthen their context.


Working within a strict set of professional dogmas, traditional architecture appears fixed on proliferating and strengthening those institutions and values which our society has begun to question. To these fixed ideologies, SITE offers an alternative. The ambiguity, irony, and humor of the Best buildings seem a welcome change.
