the physical routine no longer made 
me ache in the early morning. 
Christmas came. It was I ()40 on 
Christmas day, and I thought of the 
Northeast, buried in white. 
On Christmas night, the moon was 
full and the stars were shining 
brilliantly. As always, the quietness 
sent quivers up my back. Gazing at 
the southern hemisphere night lights 
and walking along the dirt road which 
boundaried the homestead, it seemed 
as if Esperance was the only place on 
earth. Indiana, Pa.? How could I 
conjure more than a thin, two-
dimensional image? College was 
someplace my friends were "going to." 
"Where are you going this fall, Ed?" 
"Oh, I don't know," was my answer 
all summer. Pause. "Oh," said the 
questioner. Now I was in Australia, 
learning about rams and ewes, horses 
and cows, dust and flies, stars and 
stretching beaches. 
Just as summer began to fade I got 
ready to leave. By this time, I was the 
only jack left. I packed my bags and 
Greg drove me to Esperance. I wasn't 
entirely reluctant or excited. 
I was eager to travel and see other 
parts of Australia and yet, I enjoyed 
being a part of the farm's rhythm. I 
walked along the beach one more 
time, wondering how much the days 
at Yerritop Creek Station had 
changed me. "It'll make a man out of 
you!" Man-boy, maybe. I picked up 
my duffel bag and hustled to the one-
room bus station. I hopped on, took a 
last look, and began the slow grind to 
Perth.

money here. Forget about the poor 
slobs at home. 
.. I am seeing one girl. We've been 
having a steady relationship. If I have 
V.D. that would mean she's been 
cheating!" 
The doctor looks at me blankly. 
"Well, I can't say anything about 
that." 
That bitch. That goddamn bitch! 
Couldn't do without it for a week 
while I studied for finals. Couldn't 
give a guy a fucking break. I'm not 
even going to tell her. I'm going to let 
her find out for herself. And if she 
doesn't (the symptoms often go 
undetected in women), then I'll stand 
by silently as it eats out her tubes and 
ovaries, leaving her as sterile and 
barren as her conscience. 
"You haven't even told me ... 
Doctor. You haven't even told me 
how long it takes. I mean, how long 
before I can have sex again?" 
He looks at me disdainfully. So is 
that what you're worried about? "Two 
weeks." 
"And what if it is something else? 
How will I know?" 
"If it's something else the penicillin 
will kill it. You can call back if you 
want and find out the test results. Call 
the operator and ask for the V.D. 
clinic." 
Not too loud. Everyone heard that 
last one. I get up and walk down the 
long corridor, past the multitudes of 
smirking eavesdroppers, head held 
high, proud. Oh, I wish I'd bought 
one of those jackets that say Yale on 
them like my ~other kept telling me 
to. Look at that big fat cop with the 
stupid grin. Walk up to him and say 
loudly Don't worry I didn't tell them I 
got it from you. Head for the door. 
Oh God, don't let pte trip . 
When I get home, I can't keep my 
mouth shut. "They tried to tell me I 
have V.D.," I cry, hurt and innocent. 
"It was so degrading, so humiliating." 
When I undressed for bed, there 
were two large blood stains in the seat 
of my underpants. 
I didn't sleep at all that night. 
Nightmare visions of the man with no 
legs, thrashing his arm in angry 
frustration. I hate doctors. I hate 
medicine. I bate doctors. Franken-
steins, all of them. My old roommate 
wants to be a doctor. Ob John, John, 
when you are, avenge these atrocities. 
Become the Me~siah of medicine. I 
am sorry, I am so sorry for that night 
when I told you to pack it in, that 
you didn't have what it takes. 
Remember you told me how much 
you liked Camelot? I saw it on T.V. 
last night and now I understand. It is 
my only comfort in this tear-stained 
night. There simply is not a more 
congenial spot for happy-ever-aftering 
t.'1an here in Camelot. Run, boy! 
Ruuuuuuunnnnnn! 
In the morning, at breakfast, 
Mother asks, "How is your problem'! 
Did it go away?" 
"Yes it did, as a matter of fact. It 
fell off." 
Grandmother drops her teacup, but 
Mother is sneaking a laugh behind 
her napkin. 
A week later I call for the test 
results. I ask for the V.D. clinic and 
15 
. _they connect m~ with Family 
Planning. When I call back agaan they 
connect me with another outside 
caller who is trying to reach Family 
Planning. A third call gets me Family 
Planning, and they inform me that the 
hospital doesn't have a V.D. clinic. I 
am advised to call emergency. They 
are busy in the emergency room and 
they want me to call back at four 
o'clock. 
"I won't be here at four o'clock. 
I've got to catch a train back to 
school in half an hour." 
"Well, can you wait a few minutes, 
and rn call you back." 
When she calls back, her voice is 
the voice that they use to inform a 
father that his wife has given birth to 
a set of twins. 
"P __ , I have your test results. 
Negative. Congratulations." 
••Negative!" I run through the 
house shouting. Down the stairs. 
••Negative!" I cry. "NEGATIVE! 
NEGATIVE! NEGATIVE!" 
It is joy. It is rebirth. It is baptism.
