**Yalies Don't Get V.D.**
**Author: Anonymous**
**Page number(s): 11-12**

Christmas morning and ... pus. I stare down at myself in horror thinking No it can't be. Urination isn't painful, thank God for that. But after breakfast, after we've unwrapped our presents, after church (Church? What am I doing in church, loathful sinner, bringing my disease to this house of God? How many others here have it too? And the priest, has he ever had it?), it is painful.


But it can't be, I've only been seeing one person. It's an infection, just a urinary infection, and I pore over my mother's nursing books searching for some kind of clue - big words that I don't understand and they all look worse than the clap.


No doctor, and DUH is two hundred miles away. It would be so easy if I were home at Yale. (Home? I am home, and it's not Yale.) My pediatrician shook hands good-bye when he gave me my college physical. Now I realize why pediatricians are pediatricians; they can't deal with adult problems. Tell my parents? No. A V.D. clinic? But it's not V.D. And if it is, it can wait. Oh, but it hurts when I go to the bathroom and I never know what direction it's going to come out. Mop it up with toilet paper. (They're going to wonder why it's going so fast.) Another piece - fold it in half and put it in my pants so they don't get stained.


Baby brother's two years old and he charges at me on the yellow horse with the blue wheels. Don't touch him, don't let him get near you. Babies get it in their eyes and go blind. (Then there was the guy who kissed his children good-bye when he went to work and they all got syphilis. Toddlers with oozing chancres on their innocent lips.) He calls me "P." "P," ploy. Sorry, "P" can't play; don't cry, play with Ba-ba.


What to do? Two days go by and I do absolutely nothing. But the pus is turning color, from a pure friendly white to an evil, ominous beige-yellow that dries to the color of the beige stripe (next to the green and the red) in the Gucci insignia. I am scared. I have to talk to someone.


My father always complains that I never talk to him, which is true. He is a space-scientist, and I am an English major. He used to take me to planetariums when I wanted to go to the movies. I interrupt his reading after dinner. "Dad, can I talk to you?" He looks up from his book and his heart is touched ... In private. He follows me upstairs to my bedroom. This is going to be an event - communication.


It is a disappointing event for both of us. "Have you been sleeping with unclean women?" he asks. He doesn't know anything about V.D. He doesn't ask to see it. (I wonder whose is bigger?) He wants me to visit my pediatrician. I have younger brothers and sisters who still see him, and I don't want to disgrace the family. "I think you should ask your mother," he suggests. "Maybe she can set up an appointment with one of the doctors at the hospital. Or I could take you to the emergency room at the Medical Center." Mother is called in and at this point I don't care who knows. I just want help. We decide on the emergency room. Before I leave my mother assures me, "I just want you to know that gonorrhea can be transmitted by toilet seats. It's not just an old wives' tale. They taught us in training."


At the hospital, I have to fill out forms; the nurse has to fill out forms. "Religion?" she asks. I pause a moment, measuring principles and priorities, but this is no time for a religious crisis. "Catholic." I sneak a glance at my father. He winks broadly.


We are separated and I am led through a maze of hallways. I try to concentrate so that I don't look like a lost jerk on my way out. The nurse brings me to a large room sectioned off by curtains and points to a bed in one of the sections. "Someone will be with you."


I am alone for quite a while. There is something wrong about the man behind the curtain across from me. I can't see most of his body, just the edge and the bottom of the bed. But there is something strange about the way his hand rests on the side of the bed. The woman next to me has a hernia. The doctor explains, "When you fell down the stairs, a piece of your intestine got pushed through your diaphragm ... ."


A big black nurse comes into my section with a little gadget. It is a digital thermometer. I get to watch the lighted numbers mount higher and higher until they reach 101. The nurse takes my blood pressure. She looks at the dial and laughs. "Scared, huh? Don't worry, we don't bite here." She disappears.


There are doctors gathered around a station outside. What the hell are they doing? Why don't they come see me? Another doctor joins them. They are laughing.


"Where is he?"


They point to the curtain across from me. The doctor looks in. "My God." He looks away ... "What is the nature of his addiction?"


"Morphine."


The doctor looks again. "Well, you can tell he's a sterling citizen by the protuberance of his mandible."


Laughter. "What happened to him?"


"We don't know. Either he was hit by a truck or someone shot his stomach full of aluminum bullets. Or he ate them." More laughter.


The addict's hand comes alive. It swings wildly, thrashing through the air, then dies. The doctors didn't see. One goes in and leans over the bed. False friendliness. "Hi! How 'ya doin'? Oh, I see. Gee, that's too bad."


The doctors are all laughing. They leave and the hand is thrashing again. I suddenly realize what's wrong. The hand is too close to the bottom of the bed, and the sheets are gathered strangely. The addict has no legs. The doctors are still laughing.


Finally a doctor comes to see me. I tell him my problem. My voice is choked.


"Have you had sexual congress recently?" His accent is thick and strange.


"Yes."


"When was the last time?"


The last day at school, before she left to go home. Let's see, that would be ... "Eight days ago."


"I see. Let's have a look ... Uh-huh."


Before he touches it, he puts on thin rubber-gloves from a roll hanging on the wall. They look like five-fingered condoms. I am hurt. Leper. He feels around.


"This is a venereal disease," he announces.


Injury to insult. I object. "I'm sure it's not. It must be something else." Sure kid. Something else. Your penis just has a bad cold, that's all.


"We see this all the time. It's very common."


I am not common. I go to Yale.


The doctor has a Q-tip. Oh my God, what is he going to do with that? "I have to take a sample." I don't believe it. It won't fit! I prepare for intense pain. The head of the swab disappears, but I don't feel a thing.


"Now we'll take a blood test to see if you have syphilis, too. It won't hurt."


It does. The girl who gave me a blood test at Yale was a cold bitch, but when I exclaimed, "That was painless!" she smiled proudly and said, "Thank-you."


"We will give you treatment tonight, and it will be all over." The doctor exits, and I wait. Alone.


About fifteen minutes later a young nurse comes in. Slim, good-looking, jet-black hair, trying very hard not to laugh uncontrollably. She hands me two yellow pills ... "You take these first, then the shots." She exits.


She returns later with two large hypodermic needles, each containing about a quart of penicillin ... "Lower your pants to your hips and turn over."


"You've got to be kidding."


"No. I'm not."


I stand up and lower my pants, then struggle to get back onto the table. It is difficult.


"Lie flat on your stomach if you can. It'll hurt less."


Of course I can. You think you've given me an erection or something? Don't flatter yourself.


The first needle stabs. The pain is unbearable and I stifle a yell into the sheets.


"Relax. Relax the muscle. You're making it worse."


I try. The nurse is pushing hard. It feels like she's twisting the needle. There is a plopping sound. Air in my muscle? The nurse giggles. She pulls out the empty tube.


"Oh. I forgot to ask. Are you allergic to penicillin?"


"You're a real riot, you know that?"


She stabs me again, the other cheek. Punishment. There are tears in my eyes.


When it's over, I pull up my pants. "O.K., you can go."


Go? But no one's told me anything. I thought they asked questions, tried to take names ... But ... but ... "I want to see the doctor."


She frowns ... "He's outside." There'll be no privacy.


I walk through the curtain. The room is filled with people. Patients, relatives, doctors, police, nurses. They all look at me. They all know. They smirk and nod to each other.


I find my doctor. He is busy filling out forms. He seems annoyed, that I'm bothering him.


"But you haven't told me anything. You have to tell me something."


"What do you want to know?"


"Can it be something else? It has to be something else."


The doctor stalls. "There are some things. About four or five, but they're very rare."


"But you don't understand. You see, I'm seeing one person."


"It only takes once ...


Goddamn foreigner. He doesn't understand what I'm trying to say. Can't even speak English. Why the hell don't they stay in their own fucking countries instead of coming here, taking up space in our medical schools, our hospitals. Won't even go back like he's supposed to. Too much
