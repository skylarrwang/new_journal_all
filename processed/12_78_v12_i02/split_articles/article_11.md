EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Dear Eva, 
I went to the Calhoun Happy Hour 
last week, where you arink cham-
pagne and it tastes just like coca-cola. 
Then this girl walked up to me and 
she asked me to dance! Well, I'm not 
the world's most passionate guy, but 
when I looked in her eye, I almost 
fell. She picked me up and sat me on 
her knee, and said, "Little b<ty, would 
you come on, please?" Well, I'm not 
the world's most physical Â·guy, but 
when she squeezed me tight, she 
nearly broke my spine. (I left home 
just a week before, and I never ever 
kissed a woman before.) Well, I'm not 
the world's most masculine man, but I 
know I'm a man and I'm glad I'm a 
man, unlike some people I might 
mention. Just one thing confuses me: 
I'm not dumb but I can't understand 
why she walked like a woman and 
talked like a man?

Not Dumb 

Dear Not, 
What is this, an epidemic? Stop 
worrying and give yourself over to 
absolute pleasure, as Kierkegaard 
wrote in Fear and Trembling in !.As 
Vegas. AND I WOULD APPRECI-
ATE IT VERY MUCH IF PER-
VERTS STOPPED WRITING TO 
ME! 


**Name Withheld: Dear Eva**
**Author: Name Withheld**

My husband batters me, my 
daughters look like Shelley Duvall, 
my sons are homosexuals or worse. It 
has been snowing since mid-June, the 
dog has eaten the cat, and the bill 
collector's beating at the door. (Our 
life savings were invested in Flavour-
Aide and the Midi.) On top of all 
that, I didn't even make The New 
York Times' " Hundred Neediest 
Cases." Quoi faire? 
Name Withheld 

Dear Name, 
We must not blame others for our 
own inadequacies, Name. You should 
look inward, speak to your astrologer, 
and take up smoking unfiltered 
Camels. 


**Official Memo**
**Author: A. Bartlett G.**

Official Memo: 
I've read every column you've ever 
published and I think you're doing a 
swell job. For the life of me, I can't 
see why anyone would want to 
criticize Eva.

**Yale Hooker Service**
**Author: Dino, Calhoun '81**

I was sittin' in my truck outside of 
Berkeley College, just seJling some 
firewood, and I thought up a great 
way to make some bucks. Why not 
start a Yale Hooker Service? It could 
go on the Bursar's Bill as Y.H.S. and 
serve "handfulls" and "mouthfulls," in 
the grand old tradition of the 
Calhoun Cabaret. Then folks like me 
wouldn't end up groanin' over our 
cornflakes on Sunday mornings. Y'all 
interested?

P.S. Don't want this to sound SEXIST 
or anything. 

Dear Dino, 
It's always gratifying to hear from 
students who really want to contribute 
something to the community. I'm sure 
you could get backing from your 
college's social committee. If not, you 
should try to organize it through Mrs. 
Rosen at Mental Hygiene or through 
Christ Church. Keep me posted on 
your progress! 


**A Million Dollar Baby**
**Author: Anonymous, Andover '76**

I found a million dollar baby in a 
five-and-ten-cent store, but she won't 
give me the time of day! I took her to 
see Fritz Lang's Salamanders in 
Salamanca (1943) at the Lincoln, but 
she still insisted we keep "three feet 
on the floor" when we got back to her 
apartment. I feel like I'm squinting at 
a mirage -
if mutton at Mory's 
doesn't do the trick, I'll kill myself! 
Anonymous, Andover '76 

Dear Anon, 
As Walter R . Cove and Jeannette 
F. Tudor's Sex Roles and Mental 
Illness so succinctly expressed it, 
"although not a form of mental 
illness, suicide reflects a high degree 
of mental distress." Therefore, don't 
do it. You have overlooked the Yalie's 
usual seduction site, the top floor of 
Connecticut Hall. You might also try 
giving her a pineapple. If all else fails, 
fall down and die before her; thus 
dying live, and living do adore her.

Moo!

Moo to you too. Cherchez La

**Hester P.: Dear Eva**
**Author: Hester P.**

I live in a small and provincial New 
England town. I am an outcast, a 
pariah, a marked woman. Censurious 
townfolk ostracize me, hypocritical 
clergymen insult me, I wear a mark of 
shame always. All because I don't 
conform! Can you help me? 
Hester P. 

Dear Hester, 
Believe me, I know just how you 
feel. But don't be discouraged. Take 
heed of the immortal words of 
Howard Parish: "It is from number-
less diverse acts of courage and belief 
that human history is shaped. Each 
time a man stands up for an ideal, or 
strikes out against injustice, .or acts to 
improve the lot of others, he sends a 
tiny ripple of hope; and, crossing each 
other from a mimon different centers 
of energy and daring, those ripples 
build a current which can sweep down 
the mightiest walls of oppression and 
resistance."' Amen.
