It is the middle of autumn in Hempstead Heath. An old man seated between a grey bomber hat and a park bench contemplates a father and son. They - both wearing khaki knickers and knee socks - are progressing slowly through a light underbrush which they fight through and away with the aid of canes, warped legs of wood which the trees have shed in a recent wind. A black thrush rushes whistling through the branches of a tree that has turned purple with the late heat of the season. The leaves flutter, as if the bird's wings had power to set them in motion. The man seated on the bench notes to himself that the color of the leaves, a wine color, is something which is arrived at only after many months and then endures only briefly for the glint of several afternoons.


The black of the bird is a spectacular and darkening shadow against the color of the leaves. The man thinks he will paint the scene when he has returned to his Studio and feels the strength. He thinks about what he shall do with the father and son, must analyze their character and relationship, pin them down with perfect clarity beneath the scudding clouds. The rest is murky enough, he thinks, the human element must be crisp, distinct.


Using their canes the father and son poke about the roots of a knotted oak tree. The son thrashes at the leathery bark trying to cut to the green blood of the wood which he wishes to expose underneath. He slashes his weapon like a scythe-sledge-sword. His father taps at the tree trunk huge around without any hurt, to pass the time. They do not talk. The father's sound is a steady breathing beating, the son's a furious wracking, young and uneven. Gesturing with one arm up and pointed forward, the man on the bench interprets the two figures as foresters chopping trees ... "A Corot," the man says, "and the trees will be taller and the air thicker and more substantial."


The son kicks at the caked ground with the heel of his shoe. He manages to dislodge a smooth stone, wet with the dewy clay underneath. He measures it in his palm, fixing it into the sling of his index finger, and heaves it - a slicing spinning saucer - into the bloom of the tree in which the thrush has been chattering. The boy jumps up gleefully with the crack of the stone against the first bough, and then its sound as it ricochets thuds through the tree like the banged pipes of a wooden organ. The father watches in an attitude of condonement, following the slice of the rock as if it were an extension of his son's arm. The man on the bench admires the admiration of the father. "This is the representation of love," flashes the man to himself in images of harmony: streaked shades of autumn in the boy's burnt-blond hair firing the orange brown in his father's. There is a coordination. The painter sees it and notes it and finds himself raising his hands and poising them, paletteless, in the grey air. He conducts the song of the thrush.


The father and son walk through the shaggy grass of the open spaces. The man on the bench considers whether they are returning or departing. He considers the angle at which he sees them - oblique, never scheduled for a meeting. He considers it otherwise, and experiments with the other possibilities - flipping the mental image of their bodies from one side to the other, playing with their embodiment as if turning over a negative or inverting a mirror. The man on the bench translates the father and son countless spaces forward, then rewinds them back to their original position; next he re-aligns their direction in the grass, shifting them over several degrees. Finally, he flips them over entirely: they are standing on their heads.


The man on the bench blinks and the father and son are both walking on their feet, but he notices that they are limping, that both of them are dragging the same foot, plumping it down unsmartly. "No wonder the canes," he says to himself and changes the shape of the wood, straightens it, varnishes it, and hooks the handle around to make it easier to clasp. The father and son are suddenly changing their direction, walking now unquestionably straight for the man on the bench; yet they do not see him.


The father and son are headed dead straight for the man on the bench. In the same instant as the painting of his mind registers the change in their direction, he sees the collision, the collision between himself, the man on the bench, and the father and son. He shudders and protects his hands in the cradle of his chest. He will not have them harmed. Now he notices that the father and son both wear identical sunglasses, ugly black plastic. They are the black-eye covering kind, he thinks to himself, no one wears them unless there is a wrong. The sky is the white color of dirty snow. If the sun shone it would be diluted to one dimension ... "They are blind," the man on the bench realizes, "and those are not bits of wood, but canes."


The man on the bench tries to uncross his legs. The upper leg won't unlock and he is stuck in that seated position while father and son toss away into a bush the pieces of wood they have been carrying in their hands and scamper lithely across the field. They are not even wearing glasses.


The man on the bench waits for his nurse to come to pull his legs apart and wheel him home. She has his wheel chair.
