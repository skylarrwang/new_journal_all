EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
In the spring of Wendy's ftrst year at Yale, a painful break-up 
with her boyfriend led her to visit Mental Hygiene, the 
psychological counseling department of Yale University 
Health Services (UHS). As the daughter of a recovered cocaine 
addict, Wendy had considered therapy before but had never 
followed through. Her frantic state finally convinced her to 
seek help. After one session, the counselor told her to come 
back in the fall. Although Wendy joined Mental Hygiene's 
group for children of substance abusers, she did not return for 
private treatment. 


Yale's counseling service has two functions: handling 
emergencies and providing long-term therapy. Along with 
private counseling, Mental H ygiene staffs a 24-hour 
emergency hotline. It also provides each residential college 
with a liaison counselor, to whom Freshman Counselors and 
deans can tum with questions. For campus-wide crises, the 
service offers special sessions. After the death of Christian 
Prince (PC '93) in February, for instance, a counselor met 
with Prince's lacrosse teammates. 


Mental Hygiene's main function is to provide weekly 
counseling sessions. "We are here to deal with acute 
problems, but we also have a mission to help students better 
understand themselves," said Dr. Lorraine Siggons, director 
of Mental Hygiene. "College is a good time to be thinking 
"Yale's policy is very difficult for 
students. If you don't decide to go 
in September, you're up a tree. " 
about one's self--one's wishes, aspirations, and past." The 
department provides students with up to four months of once-
a-week treatment each year. Students average nine visits, 
more sessions than most universities. But long-term treatment 
for some means fewer open slots for people like Wendy, 
whose problems do not seem urgent to the counselor at the 
initial appointment. Many students who request treatment 
after September go on a waiting list for four to eight weeks. 
For students who are reluctant to try therapy, waiting can 
shatter already tentative resolve. "I'm the kind of person who

has trouble asking for help," Wendy said. "When the 
counselor told me to wait, I thought I was being 
melodramatic." Rebecca went to Mental Hygiene to sort out a 
difficult housing situation for the upcoming year. She stuck 
out a two-month wait, but because 'the time for housing 
decisions had already passed, she felt sheepish about entering 
treatment when .her turn came. "I decided to go anyway 
because there were other things I wanted to work <:>ut," sbe 
said. "But when I felt really distraught and needed someone 
to talk to, they just weren't there." 


Â· 
Still, the co-coordinators of Yale's peer couns.eling 
service Walden, Margot Klimczak (BK '92) and Craig 
Motlong (CC '92), believe that Mental Hygiene does an 
excellent job. "Whenever I've dealt with them I've been 
impressed," Motlong said. "And I've heard only positive 
feedback from students." A Mental Hygiene counselor 
supervises training at Walden. Peer counselors often send 
students who need long-term therapy to Mental Hygiene. 
According to Klimczak, such !l referral usually translates into 
less time on the waiting list. 


Sarah bypassed the waiting list entirely. She called for an 
appointment last March when she was depressed and drinking 
heavily. Within three days, she began treatment that 
continued for the rest of the semester. "At the time, I wasn't 
sure if I had a problem," Sarah said. ''They told me I was in 
trouble and were willing to begin therapy immediately." 


Siggons claims that only some students get the 
immediate care that Sarah received because Mental Hygiene 
lacks office space for more counselors. However, Siggons 
believes that Yale allots Mental Hygiene an adequate budget. 
"We could always use more money and space," she said. 
"But the resources the University commits are certainly more 
than at some other schools." Siggons believes that Yale's 
high number of average visits justifies the delay in services. 
Sarah thinks that explanation is a cop-out. "For someone 
who's feeling fragile, having to wait can be really hard," she 
said. "Depression is such a big problem at Yale that the 
administration should put more effort into dealing with it. 
The waiting list is not inevitable. Someone is malting a 
choice about how many counselors to hire." 


Other colleges emphasize providing services to as many 
students as possible rather than long-term treatment for each 
student. Dede Laveran, a counselor at Bryn Mawr, believes 
this policy works. "We can deal with a lot of problems

satisfactorily in six visits," she said. At small colleges like 
Bryn Mawr, every student receives treatment within a few 
days. "Yale's policy is very difficult for students," said 
Laveran. "If you don't decide to go in September, you're up a 
tree. And the crisis times come later in the year." At larger 
universities such as Harvard, Duke, and the University of 
Pennsylvania, no one waits more than ten days for treatment, 
although students average fewer visits than at Yale. 


To relieve the pressure on their counseling services, some 
universities refer students to community clinics. These clinics 
"It sounds like you're going to 
have your soul scrubbed or 
something. " 
have sliding-scale fees, charging patients according to their 
income. Boston has several well-respected clinics, said Dr. 
Randoph Catlin, head of Harvard Psychiatries. Penn also uses 
local services, although Penn counselor Zoe Friedberg does 
not have the same confidence in Philadelphia's clinics that 
Catlin has in Boston's. "I've heard mixed reviews of the 
clinics," she said. "But realistically we don't have the staff to 
handle long-term therapy." New Haven has only one public 
clinic: the Connecticut Mental Health Center. But the state 
has set up this facility for people who are poor and mentally 
iU, leaving few openings for Yale students. 


Durham, North Carolina, home of Duke University, also 
suffers from a dearth of public clinics. Duke's Counseling and 
Psychological Services (CAPS) fills this void by referring 
students to its Medical School's Psychiatric Outpatient 
Service. Post-doctoral interns staff the service for nominal 
fees in return for job experience. "CAPS is not set up for 
treatment lasting more than one semester," said Rolph 
Pinkerton, assistant director of CAPS. "But the Outpatient 
Service takes care of students who need long-term treatment 
and can't afford private therapy." Although post-doctoral 
interns at Yale work at Mental Hygiene, the Medical School 
offers no outpatient service equivalent to the Duke program. 
Faculty doctors as well as interns staff Yale's Psychiatric 
Department Clinic, charging $80-90 an hour.
