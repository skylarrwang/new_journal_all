broken off and watched her sink it into 
the dusty ground. In the winter when it 
wasn't too cold, the child used it to slice 
into the snow, or to chip away at the ice 
frozen thick on the stairs. The wooden

handle, one chunk chipped out of it, was 
barely long enough to fit the child's 
hand, the blade so clean the sun 
gleamed off the metal. Every day the 
child brought the spade with her when 
Yoshi led them both to the cemetery; 
there the child ran laughing through the 
graves as Yoshi spoke to her family, 
prayed that she would join them, that 
the winter and the war would spare the 
only one she had left, her son. 

Yoshi was always cold. Even when 
she lay in her cot under a mountain of 
clothes, even when Kenji held her so 
tight she thought he would crush her 
spine, even when she sat so close to the 
stove her skin blistered red from the 
heat, she felt the chill down to the 
bottom of her bones. She dressed now 
in men's clothes, khaki trousers and 
peacoats and green earmuffs left over 
from World War I, black boots and knh 
caps the officials handed out after three 
people died of exposure; huge, ugly 
clothing everyone had to take because 
they had nothing else, because they had 
only been allowed to bring what they 
could carry. Kenji wore his cook's shirt, 
an old army jacket, and the same pair of 
gray work pants every day. The child 
wore a blue button-up sweater that hung 
off of her, an old woman's sweater, 
trailing almost to the ground like a 
dress. The child was never cold because 
she never stopped moving. In the

daytime she ran around and around the 
barracks, past the hundreds of families 
boxed inside, past the bare trees that 
reached out to her with their spindly, 
skinny fingers, through the line of 
people outside the mess hall whose 
words rose in a white mist like one 
huge collective breath, through the 
shadow of the guard tower that stood a 
few hundred feet away. The shadow 
pushed down on everybody, even when 
there was no sun. 

Kenji knew also that the child was 
a ghost. But this did not stop him from 
holding her upside down, from 
bouncing her on top of his knees. 
Sometimes when the silence in the 
room grew so large he thought it would 
swallow him, he left his mother and 
took the child, walked her around the 
camp. They walked slowly, knowing 
there was only so much they could see, 
he singing to Jhe child in a voice that 
made old men nod their beads and 
smile. Sometimes he was interrupted by 
the ringing of the bells, announcing a 
birth or a death or a meeting. The child 
took everything in as they walked. She 
saw other children run by her, laughing; 
sometimes they would stop in front of 
her and stare. She saw young women 
lean their heads together in doorways. 
She saw boys playing stickball, and 
older women with their faces powdered 
white with flour, silent phantoms. 
Together she and Kenji walked past the 
Buddhist church, a tar-paper covered 
building like every other except for the 
sign on the top and the white doors 
flung open like the arms of a loved one. 
Past the church they reached the edge 
of the camp, the barbed wire, the long 
strings of metal with teeth. They looked 
out at the brown land and the mountains 
standing silent behind it. They saw the 
endlessness of it, California desert, 
ground and sky opening up into each 
other. There the child let Kenji hold one 
of her tiny hands; with the other she 
tapped the wires with her spade. 

Sometimes, while the child thrust 
her hand through the gaps in the floor 
and tried to touch the ground, Y oshi 
and Kenji would argue. She worried 
about the unease that had been rippling 
through the camp, worried it would 
build into a wave, that her only son 
would be picked up by the momentum, 
carried, smashed against the ground. 
"We must be patient," she told him, 
"Good will come." He shook his head 
from side to side as the child pulled 
brown weeds up from the cracks 
between the floorboards. 

Kenji worried about his mother 
almost as much as his mother worried 
about him. With each week that passed 
she spoke Jess, as if opening her mouth 
would Jet in more of the cold, as if grief 
could not be carried by language. She 
sat silently and made clothes for the 
child, cutting and sewing and pinning 
her daughter's old dresses and sweaters. 
Kenji would pull a chair up in front of 
her and place his fists on her knees, 
trying to get her to meet his eyes. When 
she wouldn' t'look back he moved 
across the room and sat on his cot. The

against his knees and then touched his 
face. His eyebrows were the width of 
her fmger, caterpillars crawling across 
his brow.
