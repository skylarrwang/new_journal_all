America's militarism will cause its 
decline. 
In The Next Century, David 
Halberstam, a Pulitzer Prize-winning 
journalist, speculates that Japan's 
economic strength will soon present the 
greatest threat to America's national 
security. Halberstam believes that with 
the end of the Cold War, militarism has 
become obsolete. The new international 
"battles," he says, will be fought over 
education, economics, and technology. 
On all three fronts, Halberstam 
sees the u.s. failing because the country 
has become a war machine, eager to 
attack problems abroad while ignoring 
them at home. "Our political system is 
still based philosophically on the glory 
days of hegemony, but our economic 
(and social) system is stumbling 
clumsily in the early days of the 
new international economy," 
he writes. "The result is a 
society oddly oblivious 
of of its new realities, a 
people and a nation 
living above their 
heads, 
politicians 
who dare 
not tell the 
truth to the 
population." 
Halberstam's 
description rings painfully 
especially in light of the 
s&L scandal, the growing gap 
between rich and poor, and a decade of 
record deficit spending. 
While the u.s. strives to maintain 
its military hegemony, its economic 
empire slips into decline. Halberstam 
clearly considers military foreign policy 
a waste of time in a new world order

powered by the microchip, fiber optics, 
and multinational conglomerates. He 
believes that an integrated international 
economy will bring world peace. It 
hasn't so far, however; the inherently 
peaceful new economy just caused a 
war in the Persian Gulf. He simply 
ignores this paradox. The deployment 
of u.s. troops to the Persian Gulf, well 
underway when Halberstam wrote his 
book, merits scarcely a paragraph. 
"Even if we win that war, we may 
lose 
in 
more subtle and 
complicated ways," he warns, 
without further elaboration. 
In hindsight, the 
events of the Gulf War

worldwide, 
shows no signs 
of abating. Whether 
Halberstam likes it or 
not, militarism provides a 
crucial base for America's self-
image and foreign policy. By sheer 
force in the Gulf War, the country has 
preserved its dominant position among 
world powers. Perhaps u.s. military 
power will wane as Japan and Germany 
surge past America economically, but 
for now might still makes right. 
And for now, winning wars abroad 
seems to make America feel better 
about a disintegrating society at home. 
Last summer, 
President Bush's 
popularity plummeted after the budget 
crisis and his vetoes of the Civil Rights 
and Family Leave bills. Now, the victor 
in a lightning war, he is the most 
popular president in American history. 
A country that can rule the world need 
not worry about racial strife and 
latchkey kids. A country that boasts 
about 
crushing 
Saddam Hussein 
can ignore the 
fact 
that 
many of 
its own 
cities· 
resemble 
the ravaged

City. 
ntil a miraculous 
economic and social 
healing occurs in, this 
country, militarism is the crutch 
upon which the American ego l«~ans. 
Halberstam argues convincingly 
that the u.s. must learn to succeed 
without that crutch. He wants to 
abandon militarism completely and 
substitute greater educational and 
economic competitiveness in its 
place-the standard "peace dividend" 
line. But he offers no suggestions about 
how to bring the u.s. into the 21st 
century without fueling a tremendous 
American inferiority complex. He 
seems to feel that if America will only 
stop building bombers, everything will 
be peachy. In an economy where the 
military and defense industry provide 
millions of jobs, and in a world where 
many look to the u.s. as global 
policeman, Halberstarn's view is 
simplistic. 
He does make a convincing case 
for dismissing the Soviet Union as an 
enemy. Halberstam argues that for 
nearly 50 years America has wasted its 
resources fighting the Cold War. Now it 
appears that the Soviet Union has been 
a vastly overrated foe. 
As it 
disintegrates, Halberstam fears that the 
USSR may pull America into the ashes 
alongside it, if the u.s. continues to

view national security in military terms. 
Both America and the Soviet 
Union have lost the Cold War, 
according to Halberstam's definition of 
national security as an index of social 
and economic well-being. Victory has 
gone to a noncombatant, Japan. "As the 
Cold War was ending, those immune to 
it, or skilled at paying lip service and 
getting on with their new agenda, like 
the Japanese, prospered," he writes. 
Because Japan was demilitarized 
after World War II, it has poured all of 
its resources and nationalist spirit into 
becoming 
an 
economic 
giant. 
Halberstam noticed the trend as a 
correspondent. in Saigon during the 
Vietnam war. "My clearest memory 
from 1967, pre-Tet, was thousands of 
Americans wandering around Saigon in 
combat gear and hundreds of Japanese 
businessmen in their civilian clothes 
doing business in the city's best hotels 
eating 
at 
new 
Japanese 
restaurants," he recalls. "We were 
obsessed with the Cold War and now 
the Hot War, but the Japanese were 
obsessed with commerce." 
In Halberstarn's vision of the 21st 
century, Japan will dominate, followed 
by Germany. With their well-educated 
workers and self-sacrificing drive to 
succeed, he says, the two countries 
simply can't lose. By contrast,

overconfident, lazy. The country bas 
lost the entrepeneurial spirit it once bad. 
"Three generations of affluence ... in turn 
created a culture of high expectations, 
which in tum created a politics based 
on high assumptions and high 
consumption. What had started in the 
early fifties as a sense of possibilities 
gradually became expectations and then 
finally entitlement." Americans now 
live for pleasure and self-gratification 
more than for · freedom and equality. 
Compared 
to 
Japan, 
says 
Halberstam, the U.·S. lacks vision, drive 
and know-how when dealing with 
education and the economy. But be 
offers no concrete solutions for the 
problems he attacks. As a pluralistic 
society in every sense, America can 
hardly model itself on Japan, a nation 
so tightly knit, he argues, that its 
citizens consider themselves a separate 
race. Without a course of action, 
Halberstam sounds like just another 
liberal reciting a familiar litany of 
societal ills. 
Halberstam writes in vague 
generalizations, relying on anecdotes 
and personal impressions rather than 
cold hard facts to back up his 
assertions. He wants to provoke thought 
and debate about America's problems; 
be never claims to have all the answers 
to them. Still, some solutions would be 
nice. Moreover, Halberstam is 
hopelessly naive if he expects America 
to abandon militarism immediately and 
entirely. As the recent war with Iraq 
indicates, war spurs American 
nationalism as economics fuel Japanese 
nationalism. Such a nationalistic force 
may be impossible to replace, even if it 
drags America as far down as 
Halberstam believes it will. As the 
situation worsens at home, Americans 
may turn gladly to wars abroad. The 
u.s. doesn't seem ready to abandon 
militarism and cure its societal ills. 
At a time when most of America is 
wrapped in the flag, bailing Bush's 
militaristic 
New 
Order, 
Halberstarn cautions that success abroad 
cannot erase, and may even undermine, 
success at home. He has an excellent 
point. But as long as Americans measure 
success by wars won, not GNP gained, 
Halberstarn's warnings will fall on deaf 
ears.
