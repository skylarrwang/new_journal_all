"If they don't come to you, then you've 
got to go to them," said Dr. Wilfred 
Reguero, Chairman of Obstetrics and 
Gynecology at Saint Raphael' s 
Hospital. For the hundreds of women 
in New Haven who fail to receive 
prenatal care, Reguero offers a 
revolutionary solution. Forty-eight feet 
long and set on wheels, Saint Raphael's 
Neighborhood Mobile Clinic parks in 
front of schools, community centers, 
and housing projects, providing free 
services ranging from 
medical 
checkups to nutrition counseling. 

The van is a branch of Project 
MotherCare, an innovative effort by 
Saint Raphael's to combat the soaring 
infant mortality rate in New Haven. In 
the Dixwell area north of Yale, 23 out 
of every 1000 babies die in their first 
year-more than twice the national 
average. Reguero believes that prenatal 
care can overcome the poor nutrition 
and substance abuse that cause infant 
death. 

But in areas of the city that lack 
adequate transportation and medical 
resources, many women cannot get the 
treatment they need. According to 
Reguero, others do not realize the 
importance of prenatal care. "It's not a 
priority on their list," he said. Louise 
En do of Saint Raphael's Foundation 
Board thinks some women are daunted 
by the forbidding atmosphere of 
hospitals. "When a woman enters the 
emergency room, first she sees a guard, 
then someone asks her about 
insurance," Endo said. "Hospitals are 
very inhospitable for people without 
money." 

Intensive care for an unhealthy 
newborn costs up to $100,000. But 
according to a national study, a hospital 
saves $3.38 on neonatal care for every 
dollar invested in prenatal care. 
Although the MotherCare van will cost 
Saint Raphael's nearly $500,000 in its 
first year, the program eventually 
should pay for itself. 

The van makes regular stops in 
neighborhoods such as Dixwell, 
Newhallville, and Fairhaven, where 
medical services are scarce. "We're 
trying to reach areas of the community 
where there's not another immediate 
source of health care," said Lisa 
Collison, a physician's assistant in the 
mobile clinic. The New Haven 
community bas welcomed the facility. 
On the first day alone, 134 patients 
sought treatment from the MotherCare 
van. 

Not all MotherCare patients are 
pregnant women. The van also offers 
primary care for men and children-
from routine blood tests and throat 
cultures to alternative medicine such as 
acupuncture. One cocaine addict has 
come to the clinic weekly for the past 
three months for acupuncture. He 
claims that the treatment lets him relax 
and concentrate on his determination to 
give up drugs. "We try to do what we 
can for everybody who walks in," 
Collison said, "whether that means 
making an appointment or getting them 
booked into a service." 

Collison sees patients in one of two 
examining rooms. The van also has 
small rooms for a registered nurse and a 
receptionist, and offices for a substance 
abuse counselor and nutritionist. This

concentration of varied health services 
allows for one-stop health shopping. 
"Patients may come in for something 
and end up getting connected with a lot 
of services that they may not have 
known about," said Robin Illing, the 
nutrition counselor. If patients miss 
follow-up appointments, the driver and 
a social worker seek them out in their 
homes and encourage them to return.

program is an evening clinic at Saint 
Raphael's, open three nights a week for 
women unable to get help during the 
day. Yale-New Haven Hospital hopes 
to open a similar clinic on the nights 
Saint Raphael's unit is closed. As part 
of his project, Reguero also envisions a 
monetary incentive to boost prenatal 
care-he wants to pay women for going 
to a certain number of prenatal 
appointments. Such a program would 
save money on neonatal expenses. 
Although Reguero reports that a similar 
plan has had tremendous success in 
Europe, it has not yet been accepted in 
this country. In the United States, he 
said, "We are archaic. We are a 
disgrace."
