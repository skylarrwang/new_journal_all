too late. I was wreaking sweet revenge 
on everyone who preyed upon the 
emotional rollercoaster of wedding 
planning. 

Such moments of triumph helped 
me feel powerful in a sleazy system that 
was beyond my control. I met reputable 
florists who told me that the moment 
someone walks into their shop and says 
"wedding" they increase their prices by 
300%. Three out of four magazine 
covers feature a blonde because, 
although brunettes are 58% of the 
population, blondes sell more wedding 
dresses. Regardless of how many 
letters we received from established 
bridal free-lancers, my editors weren't 
interested in buying any new articles. 
Since the average length of a 
subscription to a bridal magazine is one 
year, the editors recycle all copy. To the 
accountants in the back room, new 
articles seem unnecessary, especially 
when each full-color, full-page 
advertisement brings in more than

industry isn't wine 
and roses, or even 
weddings-the heart 
of it all is money.

$10,000 for the magazine. If you're 
putting out a 500-page magazine, that 
consists of 65% advertisements, you get 
some staggering profits. 

No industry knows how to prey 
upon its consumers like the bridal 
industry; it victimizes women by 
exploiting the very dreams it fosters. 
Even the most rational woman is not 
immune to its schemes. One bride I 
know spent $1600 on her silk designer 
gown, twice what she planned to spend. 
When it came time to purchase the veil, 
though, she was determined to be 
frugal. She found the perfect headpiece, 
a simple bow with demure appliques 
and a cathedral-length veil. The price 
on the headpiece said $250, complete. 
Standing on a pink pedestal, surrounded 
by mirrors and seven saleswomen 
cooing over how important it was to 
have the perfect veil (read: dress, shoes, 
slip, stockings, 
make-up, 
bra, 
underpants, deodorant, etc.) on "her 
special day," she asked if the veil came 
in the soft white color of her dress. 
"Oh, that color is only available in 
silk, and there's an extra charge for 
that." How much? "In silk, which you 
need in order to match your silk dress, 
that would be $600." 

The room started to spin. $600 for 
a seven-inch bow with some netting? 
The bride shook her head sadly, said 
that it was too expensive, and left the 
store. Unfortunately, on the 45-minute 
drive home she listened to the "Love 
songs, nothing but love songs" radio 
station, and by the time she pulled into 
her driveway, she had rationalized the 
purchase. MasterCard in hand, she was 
ready to close the deal over the 
telephone when a summer's worth of 
disillusionment flooded back to her. 
Yes, I admit it. I am that bride-to-be; I 
got engaged during the last week of my 
internship. And even well-armed with 
what I knew of the charlatans waiting to 
take advantage of my excitement and 
emotion, they almost got me. 

But at least I knew better than to 
fall in love with a crystal-beaded gown 
and its stand-away portrait neckline.

gets married in July, she'll be wearing 
a different veil.
