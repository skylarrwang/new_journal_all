If you have a college degree, you 
won't be doing manual labor: this is 
one of the tacit understandings of 
contemporary work. The Nature of 
Work, 
a 
collection of earnest 
sociological essays, pries into such 
assumptions. The volume's writers 
examine class divisions in our society, 
try to account for patterns of 
unemployment, and discuss the futures 
of dirty industry and high technology.

"On Work and Alienation," nimbly 
traces the restrictive, draining, and 
emotionally paralyzing world of 
assembly lines and computerized work 
stations. Erikson claims that a growing 
mass of people have shunned the notion 
that work deserves an ethic of 
dedication. Instead, they "turn to 
activities outside the sphere of paid 
work for a sense of meaning and 
identity." 
Americans often view human 
activity along a work-or-leisure 
dichotomy: life is either tie-tight-and-
top-button-buttoned office work, or 
parasol-and-sunscreen relaxation. What 
matters to workers, claims Erikson, is
