EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Contemporary Neon features Hepburn's 
work. "By successfully breaking the 
rules of neon manufacture he has 
created a very individual form of 
expression." 

Hepburn himself may be more 
intriguing than his work. At age eight 
he was so entranced by a man working 
glass at a fair that he began melting 
light bulbs over the gas stove at home. 
Hepburn is a self-taught scientist who is 
happier talking about chemistry and 
physics 
than 
making 
aesthetic 
declarations. When asked what he 
wants his pieces to communicate, he 
quipped, "Do you mean are they 
fraught with deep inner meaning?" 
Hepburn has never lost his 
childlike curiosity and desire to invent. 
He builds all his major pieces of 
equipment-torches, 
vacuums, 
furnaces, gas gauges-from salvaged 
materials. His latest technical challenge 
is to make glass from raw ingredients: 
sand, soda, and lime. This glass differs 
from the flawless prefabricated tubes he 
used for the Neon Garage sculptures. Its 
thick, bubbly texture provides Hepburn 
with a more sculptural medium. When 
he illuminates this glass with neon, the 
light emphasizes the irregularity of its 
surface. 

Eventually, Hepburn wants to 
make gigantic neon forms with his 
homemade g lass, still impossible 
without better technology. To achieve 
this goal, he must ftrst develop the tools 
and techniques necessary for large-
scale work with his temperamental 
medium. "I'm awakeni ng to the 
possibilities of the technology," he said. 
The concept of a garage-exhibition 
space has not significantly improved 
the parking business, but it gives 
Hepburn good exposure. "People stop 
in off the street all the time," Coppola 
said. Some even have purchased or 
commissioned sculptures for their 
homes. The idea of neon as art seems to 
be catching on. "The momentum of my 
life is picking up," said Hepburn. "Now 
I am much less the mad scientist in the 
basement."
