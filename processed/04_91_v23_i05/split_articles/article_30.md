child's head and stared at the shrunken 
form of his mother. It was hardest on 
the old people; the walls of the barracks 
closed in on them most tightly. Kenji 
brought the best things home from the 
mess hall but Yoshi' s bowels still 
protested against the greasy, tasteless 
food. Many days the child led Y oshi to 
the bathroom, helping carry the folding 
cardboard refrigerator box Kenji had 
given his mother to bring. There they 
waited half an hour to catch a glimpse 
of the overflowing toilets, where the 
child waited another half hour while 
Y oshi sat in silence, the cardboard box 
her only means of privacy. Kenji was 
glad the child had appeared; she made 
his mother's days go faster. Even with 
her bottomless black eyes and dirty hair 
and silent mouth, he felt in her his best 
memories of those he had lost-if she 
was a ghost, she was a good one. He 
carried her on his hip and watched her 
catch snow on her tongue; he set her 
down and watched her dig into the ice 
with the spade. 

In December, though, the wave of 
unease overtook them. Yoshi had 
known it for months, fear strangling her 
out of her sleep. 

One morning Kenji came home 
from work and told her a man had been 
beaten, an informant. One of the 
attackers had been identified, and had 
been taken away from the camp the 
night before. He was supposed to be 
brought back inside that day. When her 
son went back to work Yoshi sat 
shivering. Around the camp the 
whispers flowed like water; alone on 
her cot she could feel them. In the 
afternoon the child came and pressed 
her face against Yoshi' s shins. Soon 
Kenji came home; people were going to 
the jail to ask questions about the 
prisoner, perhaps to protest. He told this 
to his mother and then left again, pulled 
away by the growing wave. 

Yoshi gathered herself up a few 
minutes later and followed. She limped 
outside and the child trailed after her 
with the spade. She saw men waver in 
doorways and then step out to meet 
each other. The wave swelled larger, 
washed toward the center of camp. 
Yoshi walked with the child, the sky 
dark gray above her, through block 
after block of the barracks. She had lost

sight of Kenji long before. Ahead of her 
the wave lapped up to the jail, to the 
feet of the camp police standing in front 
of it. The wave grew louder, 
questioned, shouted so that the police 
could not understand. Yoshi saw the 
wave rise up, huge but harmless. Then 
she heard them, loud cracks like the sky 
was ripping open: the police were 
firing. Screams rose up around her as 
she tried to keep from being pushed 
down; young men ran past her with 
their hands pressed to their ears. Still 
the sound of the gunshots, the echoes 
welling out into the air. Y oshi pushed 
through the crowd yelling Kenji' s 
name. She pulled the peacoat around 
her and limped through people. The 
cracks of the rifles stopped but she still 
heard them. Through the wave of 
people she saw the cook's coat, the 
gray work pants: Kenji. He grabbed her 
by the arm and led her into the flow of 
the crowd, away from the jail, away 
from the screaming and now crying 
people. In the doorways of the barracks 
men shook their heads and mumbled; 
children cried and pushed against their 
legs, covering their ears against the 
echoes. Kenji led his mother through 
the barracks. When they reached their 
own they rushed in and held each other 
on Y oshi' s cot. 

Somewhere outside of Yoshi's 
head the bells began to ring, the 
meeting bells; someone was striking 
them. All night she heard them as she 
lay huddled on the cot with her son. 
Yoshi pressed her hands against the 
thick cloth that covered Kenji's chest, 
his back, his shoulders-he had been 
lucky, nothing had happened to him. 
Yoshi sank under the weight of relief. 

At dawn, when they could feel the 
darkness begin to lift, Kenji raised his 
head. He stood up and hugged his 
shoulders, turned to his mother. "Where 
is the child?" he asked. Yoshi looked at 
him; she had forgotten. "She is 
probably back at the Children's 
Village," Kenji said, but Yoshi did not 
reply. She knew that she was not. She 
knew the child had run, bad fled; she 
felt fear tum itself over in her stomach. 

Yoshi thought of the child, her 
bottomless black eyes-she would find 
her. "Where are you going?" Kenji 
asked as she made her way to the d~. 
but his mother did not answer. She 
wrapped a blanket around herself and 
stepped outside. She had to find the 
child. Even if she had to limp through 
all of the barracks, black shadows now 
against the brightening sky. Even if she 
had to go into the Children's Village 
and pull the covers back from every 
cot, she would find the child. She knew 
this, felt the certainty lodge in her mind. 

After a night with no sleep she had 
never been more awake. Deafened by 
the bells, she had never heard herself 
more clearly. Yoshi took her first steps 
onto the frozen snow and felt it crunch 
beneath her feet. She turned right and 
walked quickly, her muscles fluid 
again, muscles of a 20-year-old, still 
young. 

The camp was deserted, all the 
doors shut tight. It was emptied of life, 
a ghost town. Yoshi knew of the 
families locked inside the barracks and 
At dawn, when they 
could feet the 
darkness begin to lift,

felt their deafening silence. She limped 
through snow and through dirt paths, 
the cold dry ground. Across parts of the 
camp bushes were spread like a rash. 
Scattered throughout were leafless trees 
that seemed to be shrinking, only 
skeletons. Yosbi pushed through the 
camp alone, did not see another person 
except for the tiny green figures at the 
top of the guard towers, their rifles 
pointed out like black serpents. She did 
not see any of those shut inside, they 
did not venture out to watch her pass, 
but she felt them. She felt their anger 
and sorrow in the bells that still rang

out all around her. She felt them with 
her as she called out to the child, longed 
for the warmth of the child's face 
against her knees. And as she circled 
back from the center of camp toward 
her own barracks again, she stopped 
feeling the others and began to feel the 
child, drawing her closer, pulling her by 
an invisible string. 

As Y oshi turned the comer to the 
back side of her own barracks, the child 
appeared before her suddenly like a 
photograph. Yoshi saw the blue sweater 
there, the tiny heap. Pressed up against 
the side of the barracks was the form of 
the child, frozen, covered with a thin 
layer of white. Yoshi ran to her. And as 
soon as she saw the child she saw the 
little hand that held the spade. There 
was a hole beneath the spade; she had 
used the. tool to dig into the frozen dirt 
right next toÂ· the barracks, into the 
ground away from the bells and 
gunshots. The child was half-way 
inside the hole. She had tried to dig 
herself through, to escape. The tiny 
hand was frozen around the handle of 
the spade. The child was covered with 
snow. Next to her the barracks stood 
black and silent, a giant tombstone. 
Behind her, the sky was frozen white. 
Y oshi saw this all in an instant. And as 
Yoshi saw the child lying there, she felt 
a hole open up in her brain; and as she 
felt her feet pull her forward she heard 
the scream that streamed out from her 
stomach; and as the hole in her brain 
opened wider she felt it sucking in the 
sound of the bells, ringing and 
pounding against the walls of her head 
until she felt her mind explode.
