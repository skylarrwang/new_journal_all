Mundy Hepburn's work redefines the art of parking-under the neon lights. 
New Haven's Neon Garage may be the 
only parking garage that doubles as an 
art gallery. The rafters and walls of the 
garage display examples of an unusual 
art form-luminous sculptures made 
from glass, chemicals, and electricity. 
Usually associated with glaring 
commercial signs, neon is gaining 
acceptance as a medium for high art. 
Since 1988, the garage-located on 
Crown Street between College and 
High streets-has exhibited the work of 
Mundy Hepburn, an artist fascinated 
with manipulating molten glass.


Hepburn's creative impulse used to 
eclipse his concern for profit. But 
financial necessity and the prospect of 
reaching a large audience made him 
receptive to the idea of bringing his 
work into the mainstream. The owners 
of the Neon Garage saw marketing 
potential in neon that Hepburn did not 
realize. "He used to just give things 
away," said Joe Coppola, one of the 
owners. "If you said you liked 
something, he'd say 'take it."' Now 
some of Hepburn's pieces sell for 
several thousand dollars. "The garage 
was my first foray into reality," said the 
artist, who is currently exploring other 
venues for his work.


Hepburn's sculptures defy popular 
notions about neon. Some pieces are 
stark, clean, and geometric; others are 
malleable tangles of soft color with 
painterly strokes and patterns. Layers of 
multicolored triangles hover above the 
entrance to the Neon Garage. Behind 
them, iridescent glass ribbons drip with 
colored paint. At the back of the garage 
hangs a bouquet of flowers-one small 
example of Hepburn's elegant neon 
foliage. Magic Garden, his large 
sculpture permanently installed at the 
Panasonic headquarters in Osaka, 
Japan, is an exotic collection of 
glowing otherworldly flowers and 
"dweaselators." Sparks from electrified 
gas crackle inside these irregular, bulb-
like glass vessels. "Hepburn is an 
alchemist-a magician with light," 
writes Rudi Stern, whose latest book
