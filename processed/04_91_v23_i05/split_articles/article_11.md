So there we were. Ten people-the new TNJ executive board--crammed into a very 
small elevator. Four others from the old board lingered outside, but we coaxed 
them in. We hit "5." The elevator started up ... l ... 2 .. .it lurched to 3 .. .4. The "5" lit 
up for a second, and we waited for the doors to open. They didn't. Slowly the 
elevator began to sink. 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... l ... B. Basement. 

The old editors got out, and we closed the doors to try again. Nothing 
happened. After a few more tries we decided to find the stairs. The basement was 
dim, dank, and filled with recycling containers. We thought briefly about setting up 
an office down there, but more on that later. After several misguided wanderings 
into closets and bricked-over doorways we found the right staircase. We groaned at 
the five flights of stairs-the easy path was clearly not ours. But finally we made it 
up to a wildly successful dinner party. And Joey's zucchini pasta was a big hit. 

We knew this experience must be a paradigm for something, but we weren't 
sure what. Here's what we came up with: in our exuberance to take the helm we 
tried to do too much at once. We've learned our lesson, but we still have a lot on 
our plate for next year. 

We're courting new readers by distributing TNJ outside Yale's gates: to places 
like City Hall, the New Haven Public Library, and Ashley's Ice Cream. In our 
inaugural issue we've tried to strike a balance between Yale and New Haven, with 
features on each and a cover story that connects both communities. We've revived 
the book review section, and we're printing a longer-than-usual 40 pages. We've 
also run the first piece of fiction in TNJ history. 

But we're trying not to lose a sense of our roots. In anticipation of our tenth 
anniversary in September, we looked through some old issues and found a 
statement of purpose written in October 1981. Having rescued a magazine that had 
died of what they called "bad luck and indifference," TNJ's second founders 
published their statement of purpose. They captured our aims so well that we want 
to reprint just one paragraph: 

We cover almost exclusively Yale and New Haven stories. We don't do this 
because our view of the world is myopic, but because we want to do what we 
can do best. With our limited resources, and your limited time, we think it wise 
to provide you with information you probably can't get in Time or Newsweek. 

Last year's board really lived up to this creed, with their commitment to hard-
hitting New Haven stories. We thank them for their leadership and we hope to fill 
the large shoes they have left. With commencement approaching we'd like to say 
farewell to the class of 1991: Mark Badger, Laura Heymann, Ellen Katz, Sean 
O'Brien, Josh Plaut, Motoko Rich, Lisa Silverman, and Roy Tsao. 

A special thanks must go to Lisa, our former Publisher, under whose 
leadership the magazine saw a quiet revolution. It was Lisa who made the decision 
to switch from typesetting to desktop publishing. With Mark, our designer, and 
Masi Denison, our production manager, she convinced the staff and the Board of 
Directors to enter the modem age. This means flexible design, no more crooked 
lines of type, and an end to last-minute dashes to the typesetter. 

Our final thanks go to Master Turan Onat and especially to Dean Christopher 
Taylor of Calhoun, who gave us a room of our own. We knew we had arrived when 
we booked up our phone and answering machine, bung photos and old TNJ covers 
on the walls, and brought in our recycling bin. And the office is in the basement-
we knew there was something in that elevator paradigm.
