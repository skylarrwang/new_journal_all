Friday, March 1, 2:00p.m New Haven 
Coliseum. 
The bus waits inside the Coliseum. 
Though the Nighthawks joke around 
before piling in, they know the next two 
days will either make or break their 
playoff quest. New Raven's minor-
league hockey team has spent most of 
the season in the cellar of its division, 
but the team still has an outside chance 
to make the playoffs. It's a five-hour 
drive to Portland, home of the Maine 
Mariners. On the bus, the players avoid 
talking hockey. But even now coach 
Nick Fotiu cuts through their chatter to 
discuss business. "If any of you guys 
think you can't win these two games, 
get off the fucking bus right now." 
Players immediately put on their 
"game-faces. " The bus grows silent. "Even professional 
players need to be reminded 
about the importance of winning," Fotiu explains. The 
bu_s remains qu~e~forabout ten mmutes after hmmg the road. 
The Nighthawks are the National 
Hockey League's (NHL) Los Angeles 
Kings' minor-league affiliate in the 
American Hockey League (AHL). The 
' Hawks have been the only professional 
sports team to stick by New Haven for 
the past 19 years. NHL stars like Bernie 
Nicholls (now with the New York 
Rangers), Bob Kudelski (DC '87), and 
Steve Duchesne (both with the L.A. 
Kings), all got their start with the team. 
The Nighthawks serve as a training 
ground for younger players and a pit-
stop for older ones, who are called up to 
the big leagues when needed. 
Before players earn a spot on the 
big-league roster, they must prove 
themselves on minor-league ice. AHL 
schedules are fast-paced, and the level 
of play is high. Players travel on the 
road for . weeks at a time, venturing to 
distant cities like Peoria, Kansas City 
and Kalamazoo. Many minor-1C:~ague 
teams play three games in three nights, 
in three different towns. "In college, 
you play 46 games, and that's if you go 
all the 
way 
to 
the 
national 
championship," said defenseman Rene 
Chapdelaine, who joined the 'Hawks 
last year right out of college. "Here you 
play 80. You really have to pace 
yourself." This year, Chapdelaine got 
what every minor leaguer wants-a 
shot at the big leagues. It was a short 
one, though. He played ten games with 
the Kings before the team dropped him. 
NHL teams draft players as young 
as 17. But while the draftees may have 
been superstars in high school and 
college, many still have to serve time in 
the minors before getting called up. 
Picked by the Kings when he was in 
high school, 'Hawks goaltender Robb 
Stauber had a stellar collegiate career. 
Named First-Team A ll-American, 
Stauber won the- coveted Hobey Baker 
A ward-for college hockey's top 
player-as a sophomore. Last year, 
though, he struggled through his first 
year in pro hockey because of a back 
injury. "I think I can play at the NHL 
level," Stauber said. "But I haven't 
proven it down here yet." 
4:00 P.M. Somewhere in New 
England. 
As the bus speeds to Portland, 
players settle into their bus 
routines. 
A group of five 
players hits the poker table. 
Stauber and Nighthawks broadcaster 
Dan Rusanowsky begin a best-of-seven 
match in chess. When Stauber loses the 
series, he raises the stakes, betting 
"Snuz"a lunchfor the last game. With 
goa/tending grit, Stauber rallies to win 
the game and the lunch. "Snuz always 
folds under pressure," Stauber 
comments. The bus arrives at the 
Holiday Inn in Portland at about 6:30. 
The younger guys set out to find a place 
to eat. Some of the veterans meet their 
wives for dinner. 


While the Nighthawks exist 
primarily to prepare youngsters for the 
rigors of the NHL, the team relies 
heavily on its core of veteran players. 
The veterans act as insurance for the 
Kings. While many younger players are 
not ready to play at the big-league 
level, veterans can easily fill in for 
injured NHL players. "I'm in a position 
here to fill the holes," said defenseman 
Don Dietrich, a former Chicago 
Blackhawk and New Jersey Devil. 
"When I'm needed, if I'm needed, I'm 
ready." 

More importantly, the veterans 
serve as mentors for younger players. 
"On the ice, I try to show them how to 
be consistent," said defenseman and 
assistant coach Murray Brumwell, a 
two-year NHL veteran. "Off the ice, I 
remember when I first started out, being 
away from home for the first time, and I 
try to give them some pointers. I tell 
them 'spend your money wisely, take a 
course in school or something, stay 
active.'" Many of the veterans are 
married with children, and they try to 
set an example of familial stability for 
the younger members. 

The junior teammates appreciate 
the special attention. "When the 
holidays came around and we couldn't 
go home, they were the first guys to 
say, 'Hey, come over to our house and 
we'll look after you,"' said center 
Shawn McCosh. "It's a real family 
atmosphere." 

Veterans enjoy their big-brother 
role, but it doesn't compensate for the 
knowledge that they may never return 
to full-time NHL play. Most veterans 
have college degrees and could find 
work elsewhere, but love of hockey 
keeps them playing. Jim Pavese played 
ten years in the NHL with four different 
clubs before he retired last year to work 
on Wall Street. But he quickly 
abandoned his three-piece suit to don a 
hockey sweater again. "At this point in 
my career, the job gives me a place to 
play and get my skills back," he said. "I 
could make the jump back to the NHL, 
but I would rather stay here. After 
missing a year, it would be nice to 
spend a season with just one team." 

Saturday, March 2, 
2:00 p.m. 
Cumberland County Civic Center. 
Portland, ME. 
Darryl Gilmour starts in goal 
because of his past success against the 
Mariners. The Mariners boast an 
experienced squad, including Boston 
Bruins regular Allen Pedersen. He is 
shocked at his sudden demotion, but he 
makes his presence felt with bruising 
body checks throughout the game. The 
next day the Bruins call him back. 
The 'Hawks also get some extra 
support. Decimated by injuries to key 
players, they receive two men from 
Phoenix, L.A.'s other minor-league 
affiliate. One of them, Jeff Rohlicek, 
arrives just two hours before the game. 
His equipment takes another hour to 
appear. He barely has time to suit up 
and join his teammates on the ice. 
Rohlicek later scores a goal, but he 
can't give the Nighthawks a win. 
Former 'Hawk Ken Hammond scores 
on a rush late in the third period to 
break a tie and give Maine a 4-3 
victory. The 'Hawks are frustrated, but 
the worst is yet to come-an eight-hour 
drive to Binghamton, NY. At least 
Rohlicek has his equipment for 
tomorrow's game. 

The Nighthawks suffer from a 
constant turnover of team members. 
Players bounce not only between the 
NHL and the AHL, but also among other 
teams and even other leagues. Some 
join the Nighthawks for only a few 
days-Rohlicek's stint with the team 
lasted two games before he returned to 
Phoenix. 

Some, like Graham Stanley, come 
to the 'Hawks after spending time in 
inferior professional hockey leagues. 
Passed over by NHL teams, Stanley 
played briefly in the East Coast Hockey 
League (ECHL), renowned more for its 
goonery than for its hockey skills. 
Stanley caught the Kings' eye with his 
scoring ability and physical prowess. 
His arrival at the Nighthawks brought 
him to a higher level of professional 
play. "There wasÂ·a lot more shuffling of 
players in the ECHL, two or three new 
guys everyday," he said. "In the 
'Cocktail League' we used to travel 
from Virginia to Erie, about 12 hours 
on a bus. We'd get maybe an hour of 
sleep and then go play the game. This is 
better." 

Sunday, March 3, 2:00p.m. Broome 
County Veterans Memorial Arena. 
Binghamton, NY. 
In the locker room before the 
game, the players seem psyched, 
gossiping about Binghamton bars and 
guys on the Ranger team. But psyched 
or not, the 'Hawks aren't prepared for 
the Ranger blitzkrieg. Pavese injures 
his groin in the first period and does 
not return to the game. To stir up the 
'Hawks, Captain Dennis Smith gets into 
a scuffle with Dennis Vial of the 
Rangers, but he hurts his neck in the 
fight. The Rangers bombard goalie 
Stauber with 15 shots in the first 
period, finding the net four times. Ron 
Scott replaces Stauber, but Binghamton 
scores three more tallies to win 7-2. It's 
the Nighthawks' fifth consecutive loss. 
The playoffs now seem a distant dream, 
and most of the players just want to 
sleep. With the NHL trading deadline 
approaching, some speculate that a few 
Binghamton players will join the New 
York Rangers soon. There is no similar 
talk in the Nighthawk camp. 

Even for some of the most talented 
players, the dream of playing in the NHL 
remains just that-a dream. Signed by 
the New York Rangers in 1983, Ron 
Scott was billed as "the goalie of the 
future." For the next seven seasons, 
however, he bounced back and forth 
between New Haven and New York, 
never getting a real opportunity to 
prove himself in either place. The 
Rangers felt they had enough goalies. 
Even a strong finish with the L.A. 
Kings last year did not earn Scott a spot 
in the club. "I'm not bitter about 
anything that's happened," he said, "but 
I would have liked a better chance. For 
anybody to be'successful, someone 
along the line has to say, 'Hey, this 
guy's got 40 games to prove what he 
can do."' 

Forward Scott Harlow also fell into 
the minor-league rut. A two-time All-
American at Boston College, he 
graduated as the school's all-time 
leading scorer. Three of his teammates 
have become NHL stars, and he thinks 
he should join them. ''I'm frustrated 
because I haven't really gotten the 
chance yet," Harlow said. "I'm happy 
doing my job. Hockey has been good to 
me. I got a house out of hockey and a 
free education, but honestly, all I want 
is that chance. If I can't do it, hey, fine. 
I'll pick up my hockey skates and hang 
them up in the garage." 

8:00 p.m. Somewhere in upstate New 
York. 
As the bus rumbles home, players 
get back to their normal routines. 
Stauber wants to take everyone on in 
chess. Bob, the Nighthawks' bus driver, 
gets everyone back to the city at 9:45, 
almost an hour ahead of schedule. A 
great job as usual, the players 
comment. They head home to get some 
sleep for tomorrow's 9:00 a.m. 
practice.
