New Haven Fights Back 
Katherine McCarron 
Cremate the dust of a guy who got bust 
Left back his girl with invasion of lust. 
Based out crack and that don't stop 
I wonder how much crack can these people pop? 
Robert Taylor taps his foot to the rhythm of a rap he is 
writing about crack. Taylor will perform his rap next month at 
a youth conference sponsored by a community group called A 
Way Out. For Taylor, who usually performs at night clubs 
like Third World Cafe, the conference offers a new platform 
for his anti-drug message. At 20, he is one of the oldest 
members of A Way Out, a group of more than 30 kids who 
want to end drug abuse and gang violence in their 
neighborhoods. Some of the members meet in the basement 
of the Hill Health Center, a community health clinic, while 
others meet at Wilbur Cross High School, to talk weekly with 
each other and several adult coordinators about whatever is 
on their minds. "The idea is that kids tell us what they need," 
said Allen London, a leader of the group and a sociology 
major at the University of New Haven. ''They target issues 
that are a problem to them-like substance abuse or 
violence-and work out the solutions themselves." 

Fighting Back Program Director Lauri Winter keeps health and 
social service programs in touch with each other. 
14 THE NEW JOURNAL 
A Way Out is part of a larger effort to combat drugs in 
New Haven. In March 1990, New Haven became one of 15 
cities--chosen out of 369-to win a1$200,000 grant from the 
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The Johnson and Johnson 
"Some people are frustrated that 
Fighting Back is not doing 
anything. It is difficult to plaf!, ... 
when people want something 
done." 
Co-mpany established the foundation to improve health care 
in the United States. Its latest effort, the Fighting Back grant, 
targets substance abuse. If New Haven can develop a 
convincing plan to beat its drug problem, the city stands to 
gain $3 million over the next five years to implement the 
programs Fighting P Jck has developed. 

The $200,()()(. planning grant from the foundation is an 
investment in the future. To make the most of scarce 
resources, New Haven's Fighting Back organizers want to 
unify existing programs before independent block watches 
and clean-up campaigns further fragment the city's drug 
prevention efforts. While the Fighting Back leaders sit in 
committee rooms, however, many community members want 
results now. "Some people are frustrated that Fighting Back 
is not doing anything," said Lauri Winter, New Haven's 
Substance Abuse Service Coordinator. "It is difficult to plan 
when people want something done." But it's careful planning 
that will give the Fighting Back movement staying power and 
offer New Haven a way out of the problems of drug abuse. 
"What's new about Fighting Back is that it's about 
collaboration," Winter said. "We ask the existing programs in 
New Haven to keep in mind that they are interrelated." While 
collaboration seems like a good idea, it's hard to integrate 
independent programs. "There are lots of chiefs and no 
Indians for the amount of work that needs to get done," she 
said. 

Although more than 200 people sit 
on the 
various Fighting Back 
committees, 
Winter 
dismisses 
allegations that the program is an 
ineffective bureaucracy. "We' re well 
staffed, but we want to keep the 
bureaucracy light," she said. "If the 
implementation grant is won, the 
majority of the money has to get out to 
the people who need it, rather than 
getting stuck in red tape." 

According to Alderman Mike 
Morand (D- 1), the most effective way 
If New Haven can 
develop a convincing 
plan to beat its drug 
problem, the city 
stands to gain $3 
million over the next 
five years to

programs Fighting

to use the money is to invest in present 
resources. " Building on existing 
strengths is the surest success, not 
trying something new," Morand said. 
Fighting Back draws on intervention 
programs such as those already offered 
at the YMCA, the Hill Health Center, and 
Members of A Way Out plan an anti-drug skit for a youth conference in May.
