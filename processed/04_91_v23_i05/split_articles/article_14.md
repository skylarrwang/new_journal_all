EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Long tendrils of ebony curls 
swirling in the wind. Smoky eyes 
peering with the innocence of a 
doe. Pouted lips parted in 
anticipation of the first kiss. A sparkling and 
shimmering ball gown, a peek of blushing 
cleavage. Pearl andÂ· diamond earrings. Armfuls 
of meadow flowers. A barefoot bride kicking up 
sand on the beach. Grace. Softness. Perfection. 
The cover bride had a zit. 
Smack dab in the middle of her forehead,. a zit the color 
of her lipstick. Five editors, two art directors, and I, the lowly 
intern, circled around the print proof; the editor-in-chief 
collapsed in a chair, mumbling feverishly to herself. But the 
worst was yet to come. "Maybe it's just me, but does anyone 
else see ... freckles?" I asked. We lowered our faces still closer 
to the proof. We looked, we saw, we groaned. What was 
there to say? A bride can't have zits or freckles. 
We called the printer, stopped the presses, airbrushed the 
zit, and lightened the tones to fade the freckles. Though we'd 
saved the bride's porcelain complexion, we couldn't deny 
that she was (gasp!) imperfect. For when her face was 
lightened to pale the freckles, her neck and shoulders 
remained a good two shades darker than her face, an 
unforgiveable make-up faux pas right on the cover. But had 
we also lightened the bride's neck and shoulders, her skin 
would have blended right in with the dress's ivory-silk-lace-
fichu-collar neckline. And that would have been a mistake 
beyond compare, for if that ivory-silk-lace-fichu-collar 
neckline didn't stand out on the cover, Priscilla of Boston 
wouldn't loan us any more $3,200 dresses for our shoots. It 
was a choice between a two-toned bride and an angry 
advertiser--one who forked over $10,000 in ads each issue. 
We opted for the Technicolor bride. 

I had accepted the bridal magazine internship 
anticipating a summer of lipstick and roses, a taste of 
publishing, and a complete switch from the androgyny of 
Yale. At 22, I was jaded. Few things seemed magical 
anymore; I had discovered that----------------------- in

year people usually don't kiss 
in the rain or set aside $25 a week for flowers and Boynton 
greeting cards. I had become a cynk. 
But when I flipped through a 500-page bridal magazine, 
page after page of champagne, diamonds, and glass slippers 
beckoned, and the princess deep inside me reared her non-
feminist head. With those magazines I bought into romance 
all over again, and I believed. I believed that the dresses were 
actually wearable, the brides were actually beautiful, and the 
people behind the magazines actually cared about helping 
stressed-out brides-to-be. Ignorance was bliss. 
Like all good things, that illusion came to an end. I soon 
discovered that the magazines, dressmakers, caterers, and 
florists are engaged in a conspiracy to make the average bride 
covet a wedding beyond a Rockefeller's dreams. The heart of 
the industry isn't wine and roses, or even weddings-the 
heart of it all is money. This fact became painfully obvious 
the first time I worked on a photo shoot. Bridal magazines 
borrow prohibitively expensive gowns from manufacturers 
hungry for free advertising. These gowns range in price from 
$2500 (which, surprisingly, is not outrageous) to over 
$10,000 (which, shockingly, is not uncommon). Such 
expensive gowns give the magazine an exclusive, Town and 
Country allure, and desensitize the bride to the 
manufacturer's outrageous prices. If a bride-to-be has fallen 
in love with dozens of $4000 
wedding goW'OS, when she 
walks into a bridal shop and 
discovers the "perfect dress" 
for $1500, it seems like quite a 
bargain. There's one born 
every minute. 
In one layout we featured 
an $11,000 fairy-tale 'dress that 
would have put Cinderella to shame. The entire Alen~on lace 
bodice was band-beaded with miniature, Austrian lead crystal 
beads-not plastic, not glass, but fine lead crystal. They 
sparkled like light on water; never mind that dozens of the 
Lilliputian beads shattered each time the model 
temperamentally folded her hands across her chest. And what 
a chest there was. For $1100 a day we got a model with the 
right coloring and figure to wear the size-six ivory dress, but 
a size-six model doesn't have any chest of consequence, 
certainly not enough for a dress with a neckline emphasizing 
cleavage. So we handed her a push-up bra, and the make-up 
artist went to work with his fairy dust and magic brushes, 
creating light and sultry shadow where there were none. 
Absolutely none. 
The most striking feature of the dress was its portrait 
neckline, a collar that stands aw~ from the body, showcasing 
the shoulders, cleavage, and collarbone. And this was 
supposed to be a portrait collar to outdo all others. It was to 
plunge gracefully in front, showing not too much make-
believe breast, and stand regally away from the shoulders, 
casting a slight shadow on the upper arms. Or so promised 
the manufacturer. In reality, the weight of thousands of 
crystal beads caused the shoulders to sag, revealing half the


bride's pretend breasts: fine for the 
June issue of Playboy, but no good for 
us, the purveyors of true romance. We 
stuffed the collar with crumpled toilet 
paper; it flopped. We tried holding it in 
position and whipping away our hands 
as the pictures were snapped; it 
crumpled. We tried asking the modeJ to 
flex her tiny biceps to support the 
collar; she couldn't. (Of course not-
how strong could she be, eating nothing 
but radicchio?) Finally, we told the 
model to lean suggestively against a 
paneled mahogany wall while we 
carefully secured the sleeves to it with 
masking tape. The neckline stood away. 
it stayed up, it was perfect. And 
because she smiled so sexily, so coyly. 
we captioned the photograph: "Jennifer 
smiles sweetly with a secret for her 
groom ... " No kidding: she was taped to 
the wall, bad pushed-up cleavage, and 
shards of crystal shattered at her feet 
every time she moved. That's some 
secret. 

By mid-summer, the magazine's 
sneaky tactics had tainted me. On one 
assignment I visited all the exclusive 
bakeries in New Jersey. Claiming that I 
was getting married the next summer, I 
requested a free taste of their cake. 
When 
you 
consider 
that 
a 
professionally decorated wedding cake 
for 150 guests costs upward of $450, 
it's a reasonable request. The bakers 
who smiled and gave me that free taste 
of cake earned kudos in my article on 
the best wedding cakes in the state. To 
the ones who wouldn't comply with my 
wishes, I flashed my bridal press pass. I 
informed them our readers would love 
to know just how miserably they treated 
brides-to-be. With that. entire cakes and 
apologies showered upon me, but it was 
I was wreaking sweet 
revenge on everyone 
who preyed upon the 
emotional 
rollercoaster of 
wedding planning.
