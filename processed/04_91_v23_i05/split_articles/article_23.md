**Mental Hygiene: A Student's Perspective**
**Author: Emily Bazelon**
**Page number(s): 28-29**

Like most university counseling 
services, Mental Hygiene is free. But 
when students have completed the 
maximum four months of treatment, or 
are on the waiting list, Mental Hygiene 
can only refer them to private therapists. 
For students who cannot afford visits 
that cost an average of $100 ao hour, 
the lack of alternatives to private 
therapy poses a problem. Mental 
Hygiene, however, does not abandon 
those they see as extreme cases, and 
some New Haven therapists will agree 
to a partial reduction in fees for 
financially strapped students. 

For students who want and can 
afford private treatment, Mental 
Hygiene counselors routinely make 
referrals. But policy limits these 
referrals. to therapists who do not work 
at UHS-meanirig that students ~annot 
add private visits with the same 
counselor to their weekly tr:eatment. 
"Our referral policy is intended to avoid 
conflicts of interest," said Siggons. She 
believes that allowing Mental Hygiene 
counselors to see students privately 
would suggest that counselors were 
using the service to recruit patients. 

Both Harvard and Bryn Mawr offer a 
combination of university-sponsored 
and private therapy. "For the people 
who need to see someone twice a week 
or more, our counselors are doing the 
college a service by agreeing to see 
them privately," said Bryn Mawr's 
Laveran. "It benefits the students by 
giving therapy continuity." 

In addition to the waiting list, 
impersonal evaluations at Mental 
Hygiene also discourage students who 
are unsure about pursuing treatment. 
Coaxed by friends who noticed she had 
stopped eating, Allison went to Mental 
Hygiene last year. "I had misgivings 
about going," she said. ''The counselor I 
saw confirmed my worst fears. He made 
me feel that ' ' my problem was 
insignificant, which really undermined 
my faith that therapy was the right . 
action to take." 

Rebecca d~scribed her evaluation 
as a slap in the face. "I was very 
depressed, and having to answer a.Jot of 
questions about whether there was 
insanity in my family and how many 
brothers and sisters I had made me feel 
like a case study," she said. "And then, 
after pouring out my whole life, they 
told me I had to wait." 

Students list other complaints about 
Mental Hygiene. The office's location 
on the third floor of UHS right across the 
hall from Student Health, does not 
afford much privacy. "It's strange to be 
on the elevator with someone you know 
and then tum left instead of right when 
you get out," said Rebecca. "There's 
still enough prejudice about therapy that 
people might think you're weird." At 
Duke, CAPS moved to the building that 
houses the Career Development Center 
to make students feel more comfortable. 

Other students find that the name 
Mental Hygiene itself conjures up odd 
images. "It sounds like you're going to 
have your soul ~crubbed or something," 
said Wendy. 

Student evaluation of university 
health services ultimately rests on the 
success of their experience. "When I 
ask Duke students about the quality of 
care at CAPS, I get a lot of different 
answers," said Chris Bragg, former 
head of PISCES, a peer counseling 
service at Duke. "It's important to 
remember that counseling is a very 
individual experience based on a 
personal relationship." Mental Hygiene 
addresses this issue by allowing 
students to switch counselors if 
necessary. 

Naomi, who avoided Yale's 
waiting list by signing up for therapy in 
September, believes her treatment has 
been helpful. "I've heard a lot of 
negative things about Mental Hygiene, 
but I really like my therapist, and that's 
what counts," she said. For Allison, 
Mental 
Hygiene provided only 
disappointment. ''I'm eating normally 
now," she said. "But I still have the 
same grief and mind-set, which kills me 
because I took the step of going to UHS 
and asking for help. I should have 
gotten it."
