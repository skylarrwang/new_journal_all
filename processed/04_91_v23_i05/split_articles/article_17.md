plans to make the health system in New
Haven more accessible by referring
substance abusers and their care
providers to available programs.
Fighting Back also hopes to draw
New Haven's many grassroots
organizations into its network. Now,
most volunteers either work in
fragmented groups or give their time to
churches and other established
institutions. This fragmentation bas
kept many programs from succeeding
in the past. "People are more concerned
about turf issues than about providing
services," said Dennis Hart, the co-
chair of Fighting Back's prevention
committee. According to Hart, Fighting
Back must unite with well-established
institutions to gain respect. "We need to
tap into the church's credibility," Hart
said. "We need to find out what the
youth groups and Sunday schools are
up to and get them involved."

But Fighting Back wants to be
more than a glorified referrai service.
The movement hopes to improve
substance-abuse care in New Haven by
supporting new intervention programs
like Project MotherCare (see page 8)

"Intervention will
keep New Haven
off the list of the
highest
infant
mortality rates in
the country," said
Bonita Grubbs of
Christian
Community
Action.

For now,
though,
New
Haven
needs
more beds in its
hospitals ,
and
treatment centers.
To
this
Â·end,
Fighting Back supports such advocacy
groups as the Consortium of Substance-
Abusing Women and their Children,
dubbed Moms and Babies. Last year,
Moms and Babies secured eight
additional beds at the Crossroads
treatment center from the state
legislature. Crossroads is the only in-
patient center in New Haven that allows
substance-abusing mothers to keep their
children with them while they go
through treatment, rather than placing
the kids in foster homes. But eight beds
are clearly not enough. Addicts who

need treatment and have no private
health insurance still face six-month
waiting lists at public and grant-funded
facilities like Crossroads and the
Addiction Prevention and Treatment


The real question is where Fighting
Back will find the money to implement
the treatment programs they demand.
" The Johnson grant will not fund
treatment," said Cynthia Farrar, director
of the Special Commission on Infant
Health. "The Foundation never saw
itself as responsible for having to pay
for everything. They
want to
concentrate
their
support
on
prevention."

One of Fighting Back's main goals
is to learn what New Haven needs from
the people who themselves are at risk.
The A Way Out conference scheduled
for this May will give New Haven
youth a chance to tell their peers and
the community that the problems
related to substance abuse need to be

solved. Their raps, skits, and banners
are an important first step toward
raising community consciousness.

Fighting Back hopes to become
synonymous with collaboration in New
Haven. "We are not out there to say
we're the answer," Winter said. "We're
not here to take anyone over. We're
like a thread that binds existing
programs together." If New Haven does
not land the $3 million implementation
grant from the Johnson Foundation next
year, Winter believes that the program
will find other sources of funding.
"We' ll use our Johnson grant as seed
money to start the program and
continue to press for funding from other
sources," Winter said. "Fighting Back
is here to stay."
