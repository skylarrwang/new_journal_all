The author responds:

• I entered St. Raphael's Hospital with full permission from officials there and followed the proper pass procedures. My name was entered in the guestbook and I was given protective clothing by the floor nurse before entering the patient's room. Our photographer received formal permission from the floor nurse at Yale-New Haven hospital to take photographs of the isolation rooms.

• I did not "force my way" into the patient's room. My visit was announced by the nurse. I knocked on Lana's door and was invited in. She spoke with me for almost an hour, fully aware my account would be reported in a Yale magazine. I honored her wish not to be directly quoted or cited by name. The resulting paraphrase is entirely accurate.

• I made every effort to protect Lana's anonymity. I understood the potential consequences that my reporting might have for her from the beginning. Our decision to run the story came after much soul-searching. The executive board of the magazine felt then and now that the public issues and dangers were too important to conceal.

• My assertion that Lana's baby "will probably die within a year" was supported by Lisa Stone of the New Haven Health Department and reported in several articles by Joan Barbuto of the New Haven Register. According to the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, no stage-three AIDS patient has ever survived.

• My statement that "doctors are waiting for Lana to develop the devastating extreme form of AIDS" was based on information supplied by Ms. Stone.

• Dr. Dwyer refused to be interviewed for the story about Lana, despite my several requests. According to his secretary he was "too busy" and referred me to Dr. Randolph Young, whom I cited in the article. However, Dr. Dwyer, who appeared on 60 Minutes on February 19 with Morley Safer, confirmed not only that Lana has second-stage AIDS, but admitted that she posed a significant threat to public health.

• As for "faculty supervision," The New Journal has no faculty supervisors, nor does it intend to get any.

**In Appreciation**

TNJ would like to thank the Masters' Offices for their generous contributions to this project, offered in honor of graduates and students of their colleges who gave their lives in Vietnam.

Without the support of the Masters, this issue, reflecting on Yale's involvement in the war, would not have been possible.

Berkeley, Branford, Calhoun, Jonathan Edwards, Morse, Saybrook, and Timothy Dwight Colleges have all contributed.
