including aduh education, sheller for

between the <·urrent situation and the 
events in Southeast Asia twenty years

Coffin has already be<.•n tc> Nicarai{Ua 
twice, just as he went to H.mot in IQ72. 
Riverside boasts an unusual numlx•t of 
speakers and \'isuors from Ct•ntral 
America and has been the site of s<.'v<.·ral 
protest fasts. 


Coffin's rdati-.e silence doesn't bothl·r 
him, because he confidently prt•dicts the 
return of the "ethical unrest" of the six-
ties. He perceives two dominant tradi- 
tions in American politi(al l<·ader'ihtp, 
one represented by the zealous sdf-
righteousness which led to Vietnam, 
and the other by the "Socratic gadnies" 
who opposed it. "Unrest has to return," 
he 
says, 
shrugging his shoulders, 
"because the line of oppression won't 
stop, and more and more people will get 
fed up. Besides, anger maintains your 
sanity- if you 
don't 
argue when 
Reagan says, 'the US hils never been an 
a~grt·ssor,' you've already slipped into 
some unreal situation. Or," he chuckles, 
"you might say a significant Satanic 
triumph has taken place." 


What Coffin does miss is the "decent 
ang<.·r" which he felt among students in 
the sixties. He concedes that there were 
a 
"lot 
of 'right-ons' which 
were 
substituu.·s for good thinking," but 
nothing annoys him more than the 
apathy he so often encounters today. 
estx•<:ially when it is evinced by students 
at places like 
Yale. 
"It's so self- 
indul~ent. For a bunch of Yale students 
to feel like there's nothing they can do is 
just an excuse to lake another trip tO 
Mory's. If you're disillusioned, you 
have to take vourself to task for having 
illusions in the first place. Reality is 
wugh." 


Because of the power and prestige of 
its alumni and students, Coffin also has 
a special fear of what apathetic Yalies 
can achieve: "It takes a Ph.D. to blow 
up the world." H is feeling is that the 
university's moral relativism tended to 
produce "kids who were so bright, so 
clever, and so lacking in wisdom and 
compassion." 


Coffin himself hasn't slackened, nor 
does he believe most of his closer 
associates from his Vietnam protest 
days have. In his case, one reason for 
perseverance despite changing 
political winds has been his religious 
orientation, which not only doesn't 
preclude political activism, but is in fact 
the source of it. He considers himself an 
orthodox believer, although his church 
is inter-denominational. H is religion is 
one of optimism; he believes that "the 
whole C hristian understanding of sin, 
as well as the fact that there's more mer-
cy in God than there is sin in us is ab-
solutely central to my own personal 
well-being." Coffin's book~helves, which 
contain ponderous-looking theological 
commentaries alongside the Journals of 
Sylvia Plath, My Harvard, My Yale and 
Soviet Policy in the Arc of Crisis, testify to 
the nearness of his religious beliefs to his 
other interests. 


Most importantly, Coffin believes 
that 
the triumph of the "gadflies" 
ultimately depends upon an ability to 
see the wider moral implications of 
one•s activities. "Of course if we had a 
really hot war on our hands, the reac-
tion would be, 'Our sons should not be 
dying in a foreign land for a bad cause,' 
and you'd see protest. Now you'd hope 
people would take the next step: nobody's 
sons should be dying anywhere for a bad 
cause." A glint reappears in Coffin's 
eye. "After all," he adds "moral excite-
ment keeps things interesting." And he 
has faith; he still believes that "T hings 
do change. Things did change. And if 
you care about poor people at all, 
you've got reason enough to knock 
yourself out. All we have to do is take 
democracy more seriously at home, so 
we don't destroy it abroad."
