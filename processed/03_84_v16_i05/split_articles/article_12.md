Rethinking the Sixties Myth

The last Amt•t ican soldit•t kfl Sai~on II years ago this 
month. but tht· \'i<.·tn.un <.'ta hng<-rs in its own way. For 
some tht• period of <,tudcnt protest now seems a quirk of 
history, a frivolou-. and misguidt·d amtir. But for many 
young peoplt•. it ha)i hl'f011ll' a subconscious soun·e or in-
timidation: Why, W<' may ask oursdves, "A-ere the P<'opk 
and th<.· idt•as and tlw music so alivt• and novel and spon-
taneous then? Why docs collq.{<' life appear so static and 
picked over today~ \\'hy ha\l' we !'<tiled to break m·w 
ground? 

Living in the shadcl\\ of.John Lt·nnon and Abbie Hofl'-
man and Martin l.uthn King. Wl' cannot<.·asil~ picture our 
C1wn timt· a~ a part of hi,ton . l\1anv of out· t'ndea,·ors seem 
to palt• into tn'iignifirann: wlwn compared to the glamour 
and tht• gravity of tlw rnolution that pn•ceclcd us. Some of 
us wish that\\(' too 1 ould bt• pluggt•d into sonwthing- larg<.·r

who suppowdh man lwd "ith angt·r· through tear gas. 
against tlw flag. It ts ,, dilli< uh fi>lklorc to get beyond. 

Of course, the Vit•tnam t•ra could not rt'allv have been as 
glamorous as all that. The students who li~ed through it 
were surely just as confused and st'lfish as we are today. 
Those glorious marcht•s on Washin~lOn, I am wid, were 
often nothing mon· than grandiose t'xcuses for socializing. 
The difference was that the draft was clamping down on 
them. Nineteen-year-old kids were dying in what seemed a 
senseless war on the other side of the planet. So Vietnam 
enabled students at home to throw themselves into an 
uncertain situation and come away from it with a feeling 
that they had left a mark. However naive or self-indulgent, 
they were surely part of something, part of some momen-
tous scene running through time. 

In the liH·ral sense, tlwse arc conservative times at Yale, 
and conservatism bv its nature abhors a fire. What are we 
conserving? Tht• fu~·l of the sixties without its flame. The 
methods of the sixties without that passion for st'cing novel-
ty around cverv bend. Instead of thinking of the upheaval 
in Central America as ant'"" and distinct problem, we tend 
to think of it a!> "another Viet narn. ~ The mvth of the sixties 
has also had the unfortunate t'llect of making students feel 
as though they must wt•ar the mantle of some political per-
suasion, that they must expr<.·ss themselves in some ,-ocal or 
visible way, without kno'"ing \\hy. Activism has for many 
become an end in it'>t'lf.

Ovt•r three million Americans served in Vietnam, and 
more than 57,000 never returned. Thirty-four of those who 
died wt•rt• Yak· alumni or students, their names now etched 
into the.• marbk of Woolsey H all alongside the fallen war-
riors from Amt•rica's past.

In this issue we tell the stories of five less familiar Yale 
people and their lives during the Vietnam era: Dick Per-
shing. grandson of Gt'neral John Pershing and a 1966 
graduate of Yale, who died in combat in Vietnam in 1968; 
Arthur Galston, a Yale plant biologist, who unwittingly 
discoven·d an early formula for the chemical defoliant 
Agent Orange in 1943 and later played a major role in the 
governmt•nt's decision to stop the spraying in Vietnam; 
William Sloam· Collin, Yale's outspoken chaplain from 
1<>58-1974. who was criticized for providing sanctuary to 
draft resistt•rs and praised for holding the university 
together during the most radical years; John Kerry, Yale 
'66, who fought in Vietnam, won three Purple Hearts, 
or~anized tht· Veterans Against the War and is now run-
ning for Senatt• in Massachusetts; and Dr. Kristaps Keggi, 
a Yale.• Collc.·ge and Medical School graduate, who served 
from 1965 to 1967. V..'e have also reprinted a story from Tht 
.\'n( Journal of 1971 by Yale Law graduate Jack Fuller, 
\\ho'ie new novel about Vietnam, Fr~ts, was published 
la<;t month. Finally, the co-founder of ThL Ntw Journal of 
I 967. .Jcrrv Bruck, writes about his days at Yale. 

Throughout, '"e hope to sh<'d light on the Vi~tnam period 
at Yale bv putting a face on this polemical subject. 

Our goal is to try to see Vietnam for what it was: an 
event of human proportions, an event that did not simply 
transpire.• in the pages of history, but was shaped by people 
ht•rt• at Yak \\hose lives were not so different from our 
O\\ n .
