In 1943 the United States Army Chemical Corps at Fort Detrick Laboratories in Frederick, Maryland, was at work on a scientific solution to the problem of visibility in jungle warfare. Thousands of American combat soldiers were being killed by the Japanese on island strongholds in the Pacific theater of World War II, cut down by an unseen enemy hiding in the dense underbrush.

In 1943 Arthur W. Galston (now a renowned plant biologist at Yale) was spending most of his time in a laboratory at the University of Illinois. He must have seemed innocent enough in those days, a 23-year-old botanist from Cornell, working away at his soybean pods for a Ph.D. He had discovered that by spraying his plants with a certain concentration of a chemical compound known as TIBA, he could enhance the budding process and improve soybean yields by as much as 30 percent. Galston was pleased with his discovery ("I felt good inside," he later said, "you know- more soybeans, more happiness"). So he gathered together his evidence, wrote up his thesis and gave it the innocuous title, "On the Physiology of Flowering, With Especial Reference to Soybeans."

When Galston handed in his thesis and headed off for the Navy in 1944, he thought he was through with TIBA. Soon a company in Skokie, Illinois, patented a form of TIBA and successfully marketed it as a productive agricultural compound. Meanwhile, Galston, who never made a cent off his formula, served as an agriculture officer for the U.S.N. Military Government at Okinawa.

Others became interested in TIBA as well. The boys at Fort Detrick got wind of Galston's discovery. They were paying special attention to one inconspicuous paragraph in Galston's thesis in which he had noted that TIBA, when applied in slightly higher concentrations, caused the leaves to fall off his soybean plants. Soon Army officials were contacting him to find out more. "They weren't interested in my soybean pods," said Galston, "They were interested in defoliants." The Chemical Corps spent months studying the "abscission-promoting properties" of TIBA, mixing up other compounds, synthesizing chemical analogs, narrowing in on the perfect herbicide. In a time of all-out war, Galston was not going to argue with the military over the rights to his soybean compound. "That was in those dark days, when we were all working furiously to clobber Hitler," Galston recalled. "Even had I been fully aware then of the potentially destructive nature of my research- which I wasn't- I still wouldn't have balked. We were all in this together."

The chemists at Fort Detrick did not find the formula they were looking for in time for World War II. President Truman ordered the bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and soon thereafter interest in strategic defoliants diminished.

Not until 1961, when the United States first entered the conflict in Vietnam, was the Pentagon convinced that the time was ripe for defoliants. "Unwittingly, in my attempt to solve a basic problem, I had spawned a destructive weapon."

Military experts argued that chemicals could be used not only to expose the hidden trails in the Asian jungles, but also to starve out the Viet Cong. Another purpose for employing chemicals would later be revealed: by spraying and destroying crops in civilian areas, it was thought the Army could create a flow of refugees from Communist-controlled villages into regions occupied by the South Vietnamese government.

The new chemical the Department of Defense was boasting about was known as Agent Orange, so named because it was initially stored in 55-gallon drums identified with orange stripes painted on the sides. Modeled after Galston's prototype TIBA, Agent Orange was essentially composed of two chemicals which in 1960 were generally thought to be safe, although DOD had done little testing to determine precisely how toxic they were to humans. Biochemists did know that one of the chemicals, called 2,4,5-T, contained dioxin impurities. It was also known that 2,4,5-T could cause a skin condition known as chloracne, and that it could produce serious birth defects in laboratory rats. But DOD maintained that the potential hazards to humans were "so small as to be inconsequential."

"The Department of Defense made a less-than-zealous attempt to understand the possible biological consequences of using this chemical," said Galston. "DOD was saying, 'Look, we can do this cleanly! All we have to do is knock the leaves off the trees and we can fight our own war.' That was a message the field marshals were eager to hear."


So at the insistence of his military advisors, President Kennedy authorized the first experimental spraying of Agent Orange over Vietnam in 1961. In the 10 years that followed the United States Air Force sprayed over 100 million
