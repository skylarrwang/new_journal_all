EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
My tutor C. Vann Woodward was a patient and forgiv-
ing gentleman. I remember him ensconced in his corner of-
fice, looking like a melting icc cream cone, his eyes that 
seemed forever searching a library shelf in his mind. He 
said little in our meetings and then usually to ask, "Where 
is your evidence?" 

But one day he said, "Why study history?" 
"Why?" 
"Yes. Why?" 
"Well, to show where we've gone wrong, to find the 
reasons beneath it, to help keep it from happening again 
" 
"Nonsense," he said. 

The angel of silence settled in the room. 
"Then . . . why do you 
study history?" 
"Because I like to." 

Though Professor Woodward's contempt for racism 
helped distinguish him from 
the start of his long career, 
4 and his history of segrega-
tion, undertaken at the urg-
ing of the NAACP, was said 
to 
have influenced 
the 
Supreme Court in its 1954 
Brown decision, he'd under-
taken this last reluctantly and 
refused credit for his role. He 
wanted it understood that he 
would never compromise the 
web of curiosity and suspi-
cion that partly formed his 
craft for the sake of serving 
the present. Not on purpose, 
anyway. 

What a year to lose to 
school. At 
the very last 
minute I retreated to an 
underground seminar room 
at Yale, coming and going 
only for food or sleep through 
the subterranean tunnels that honeycomb Berkeley Col-
lege, looking for order in a sea of notes spread across six 
banquet tables, sometimes standing on a chair pushing 
scraps of paper into patterns with a stick. 

A standard Civil War bullet, huge and heavy. lay on the 
desk. It helped me understand the gruesome 1869 Surg~on 
Gmaal of tlu Unit~d Stat~s R~port on War Wounds-such a 
bullet in the arm or le~. to give you that war's ambience, 
didn't make a hole, it could tear the limb off. But my sub-
jects stayed strapped to the rails of history and I could only 
watch as the men gallantly tied themselves down in its 
locomotive's path and the girls and women cheered them 
on. (Thank goodness, at least, that they lost.) The tale of 
how the slaves were freed and then enslaved again was so 
full of surprises and pathos that I used to prowl around late 
at night in scan·h of someone who might like to listen to the 
latest installment. 

Problems, problems- my actors faded in and out-
when two good letter-writers got back together the record 
vanisht·d. I thought for a while I had all of history decoded, 
until my friend the nursing student, looking in, said, "This 
Dexadrinc I got you, you don't just keep taking it!" so I 
learned to sleep on sec·ond nights. 

"Where is your evidence?" the relentless Professor Wood-
ward would ask whenever something caught his eye, and 
I'd have to recite chapter and verse. !'Jight after night my 
nose got rubbed in an irreducible, specific, blood-real past, 
chained to the tables by ribbons of footnotes that grew to 
seventy 
pages

:; execution and stared in mor-

i One met and questioned 
President-elect Lincoln; 
another led Virginia out of 
the Union. Yet for all their 
inside vantage points they 
couldn't 
anticipate their 
future any more than I could 
mine. 

I clung to my superiority 
-all of them were dead, after 
all; didn't that make me 
smarter? Irony or sarcasm 
broke through into the pages 
here and there, but I was 
beginning to see my su~jects 
trapped 
in 
immense 
glacier that was history. You 
have to grow cold-blooded to 
get down in-side that ice. 

The obscure few who saw a little ahead could only work 
their vein and hope the effort would fertilize an unknow-
able future. They sometimes paid a terrible price. But 
renegades and troublemakers made this modern world, all 
of it. 

I visited Yale last fall; it was a shock to find most of the 
gates locked most of the time. I know you study more than 
we did, that you have to work harder against the future, 
that it's more of a risk now to step out and run the risk of 
being foolish. Listen to an ancient alumnus who hopes to 
look up to you one day and don't grow old before your 
time.
