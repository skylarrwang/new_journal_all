P ersh with varsity lacrosse teamma tes Jim Howard and John K erry in 1966. 
fleer Candidate School (OCS) where 
they taught him to use an M-14 rifle. 
The following spring, they sent him to 
Fort Benning, Georgia, to learn to 
parachute. On August 17, 1967, he was 
made a Second Lieutenant and assign-
ed to the 101st Airborne Division. 
Persh's 
friends 
report 
that 
the 
military began to interest him more 
afte•· he joined it. "H e got caught up in 
the whole OCS thing." Cross recalls. 
"He seemed anxious to succeed in the 
military." 
Jim Howard remembers 
driving Persh down to Fort Dix after a 
weekend together in New York. "He 
was pleased with what he was doing, 
but he didn't know what to expect in the 
future." 

In the fall of 1967, Lieutenant Persh-
ing began preparing to go on active du-
ty in Vietnam. The Army sent him and 
his unit to Fort Campbell, Kentucky, 
for a series of exercises in preparation 
for combat. Persh also got engaged to 
Shirley Gay. a woman he had been 
dating since he broke up with Kitty 
H awks, his college sweetheart, just after 
graduation. His parents threw an enor-
mous engagement party at their house 
on Long Island and invited all of Persh~ 
old friends. They were surprised when 
D_ick wore his uniform to the party. 
Persh was nervous about his upcom-
ing tour of duty though he took pains 
not to show it except to his close 
friends. Laidley remembers seeing him 
for the last time at the Yale-Harvard 
game. "We went to some bar some-
where and ordered a couple of glasses 
of champagne. He threw his arms 
around my neck and we started wrest-
ling, just like old times. Suddenly he 
grabbed me as hard as he could and 
hugged me. 'God I'm scared,' he said. 
We both started crying. The moment 
passed and soon he was jumping up on 
the table doing his Zorba dance again." 
In December, Persh received his 
orders w assume active duty in Viet-
nam. 
. . . The "VC can be workin,{? in the paddies 
one minute and in a clump of trus the next 
firing at _you - _you can i tell who or when or 
wherr-and finally-why . . 
It may .be 
r~y worm's c_ye vit'w of thr co'!flict, but iJ 
makes no sense. These people could care less 
about words like democracy or popular repre-
sentation or elections. They want to farm, to 
grow rice and chickens, to make love and to be 
lt;ft alone ... 

Many of Persh's friends were shaken 
by the change that had come over th eir 
friend since he had gone to war. At 
Yale, "he was rather apolitical, not 
really all that well -mformed. But I 
guess he was fairly conservative," 
recalls Thorne, now a consultant work-
ing in Boston. From Vietnam, his let-
ters indicated at least a new awareness 
if not a change of heart. More striking 
than the change in his view of the war 
was the new seriousness and the weight 
of Persh's responsibility. "It was a dif-
ferent Dick Pershing who wrote me 
from Nam," Laidley recalls. "No more 
igel." His roommate also detected a 
change. "In the war, he found a group 
of people whose Ji,·es he was responsi-
ble for," Singer explains. "That was not 
something he'd had before and I think 
he became responsible as hell when he

Dear Bo, 
Just a short note to let you know that Persh 
is still in the pink of good health despite half 
of the slope heads in SE Asia taking out their 
own personal vendella against him. On the 
bad guys' side may be numbered the myriad 
beasties that go bump in the n~t:ht ... and 
believe me a 3 7 lb. mosquito will go bump as 
he busts against the crust of dritd sweat, 4 
day old insect repe/lant, conl:ealtd C-Ration 
juices and dessicated night 
soil-bloated 
leeches. 

. . . We move into paddies tom'w for 10 
days of combat assaults by chopper- workin.t: 
company stu units in an area reputed to 
house 3 NVA REGIMENTS-a lillie like 
the Parsons' Institute for the Blind playing 
the Padcns in Green Bay 
Two weeks after Persh wrote that 
letter, the IOist infantry received 
orders form the American command in 
Thua Thien to lead a combat assault 
on Hung Nohn, a small village some 
400 miles North of Saigon reported to 
contain a North Vietnamese baualion 
headquarters. The routine was not 
new to the 101 st. They had been on 
several missions like this one since 
Lieutenant Pershing took command of 
Company A in Dccembet·. 

. .. Presently workin.t: near the DMZ in the 
town of Quang Tri. R1:~ht wlurl' thl' action 
is -to be sure- but thr .~to~}' of war doern 't 
come on as strong as its suppoud to- We've 
killed nearly 700 NVA troop.1 in this area in 
the last three days and the on(y results I've 
seen are random bod irs -luadleu or without

As 
American 
soldiers 
ap-
proached the village, the North Viet-
namese opened fire on them. The 
Americans began to retn.·at. but Com-
pany A and 
Lieutenant 
Pershing 
stayed behind to provide a base of (ire 
to allow the Americans to pull back. 
Unfortunately.

headquarters that night. The fighting

real.'" 
had been intense: There had been 
casualties. One of the men had fallen 
in the field and remained unaccounted 
for. Lieutenant Pershing decided they 
should go back and look for him. 
The 101st returned to Hung Nohn 
the next day and began searching for 
their fallen comrade. They were met 
again by enemy gunfire, but they con-
tinued to search through the knee-deep 
mud in the rice paddies on the out-
skirts of the town. Lieutenant Pershing 
called for a troop deployment from his 
exposed point position at the head of 
the platoon. "Shift over to the left," he 
yelled with a wave of the hand. Just 
then, a rocket-propelled grenade round 
flashed in from a bunker. It hit a rice 
dike with a blinding flash. The force 
threw him to the ground. Fragments of 
the grenade tore into his neck and 
shoulders. 
Though critically wounded, Lieute-
nant Pershing refused to relinquish his 
command. He attempted to withdraw 
to a better vantage point from which to 
direct his troops and reassess his situa-
tion. Minutes later, he was wounded 
again, this time by ..1 gunshot to the 
neck. His shoulders, neck and face 
now ragged, he died in the field. 

. . . I'm a little tired to wax long on political 
philosophy but all I want to do is put in my 
time and come home. There are too many peo-
ple over here sweating and cb!_ing and getting 
crippled to leave now-even ij I could- and 
maybe I can keep some of our people healthy if 
I can imbue them with my own brand of or-
thodox cowardice. Fear is there all the time, 
but generally too busy or uncomfortable to 
notice-you become pretty resigned and just 
hope you'll be Lucky ... 
Persh's friends felt that in dying 
while searching for a lost comrade he 
had lrved up to his own character 
rath~ than any military code he might 
have' learned. "His belief was in peo-
ple more than in the military," AI 
Cross claims. "I don't think he wen~ 
back to look for his friend out of 
military commitment. His friend was 
out there and he needed help." 
Even more than the grief that
