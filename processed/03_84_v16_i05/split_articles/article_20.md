teaching full-time at the School of 
Medicine upon his return to the States 
in 1966. He had decided to teach or-
thopedic surgery while working in Viet-
nam. Due to what he calls his "medical 
idealism," Keggi felt a great need to 
share his unique experiences with 
students. 

At the 
med school, 
he 
established a war surgery lecture series, 
drawing almost entirely from his work 
in Vietnam. 

Initially, most people within the Yale 
community reacted to Dr. Keggi and 
his Vietnam service with curiosity and 
sympathy. "But the lines were drawn by 
1967," saxs Keggi, alluding to the deep 
division o
f opinion over the war. "Any 
debates about Vietnam would degen-
erate into shouting matches. There was 
so much emotionalism over the war 
that, instead of seeing shades of grey, 
people would call you a fascist pig." • 

Keggi quickly recalls a psychiatric social 
worker whose son had a broken arm. 
The social worker refused to let Keggi 
treat the boy because of Keggi's volun-
tary service in Southeast Asia. 

Beyond his own experiences, Dr. 
Keggi remembers the harassment of 
student veterans at Yale. "They were 
spat upon," says Keggi, his slow, casual 
speaking style growing emphatic. "The 
Yale undergrads who returned here 
were typically looked upon as war-
mongers or as idiots who had allowed 
themselves to be drafted. The average 
Yale student did everything to avoid the 
war, the idea being that you shouldn't 
sacrifice intelligent lives." 

But Keggi sees Yale and the nation 
atoning for their hostility toward Viet-
nam veterans. "The war is viewed now 
in realistic terms, unemotionally and 
impartially," he says, "The discussions 
over Vietnam are much fairer. Now, 
General Westmoreland could lecture at 
Yale without being called a baby killer." 

Though the actions of the anti-war 
supporters bothered Keggi, he bears no 
grudge against the majority of Yale ac-
tivists. Rather, he perceives most of 
them as sincere but misguided people. 
"They were all well-meaning," explains 
Keggi, "but they played right into the 
hands of world communism. Of course, 
none of them were communist spies or 


on the KGB payroll, but the R ussians 
were very clever about manipulating 
American peace movements for their 
own needs." 

Keggi 
believes the Vietnam-era 
chaos had a number of effects on Yale. 
He believes the university lost substan-
tial alumni moneys due to then-Presi-
dent Kingman Brewster's attacks on 
American involvement in the war. 
More importantly, Keggi maintains 
that the past activism at Yale has in-
stilled a "reverse M cCarthyism" in the 
faculty. "It used to be if you had com-
munist ties, you couldn't work," ex-
plains Keggi, "But now the faculty is so 
liberal that anyone who has an opinion 
to the right of the far-out views of the 
department is looked upon as a nut and 
denied a job." 

Through all his experiences, Kristaps 
Keggi remains true to his ideals. T he 
events of the sixties have reinforced his 
belief in a strong national defense and 
universal civilian and military service. 
Since the dismantling of ROTC at 
Yale, Keggi no longer contributes to 
unrestricted 
alumni 
funds. 
Yale's 
guarantee of financial aid to registration 
resisters prompted Keggi to voice his 
dissatisfaction to President A. Bartlett 
Giamatti, whom he had known as an 
undergraduate. According to Keggi, 
their brief correspondence ended with 
each man telling the other he was 
wrong. 

Today, Keggi has a private practice 
and continues to teach med school 
residents the skills of reconstructive 
surgery. 
Methods of coping 
with 
pressure he learned as a resident helped 
him greatly in both V ietnam and New 
Haven. "As a surgeon," K eggi says, 
"you develop 
a 
certain defense 
mechanism to cope with the grim facts 
of life. It was a tremendous waste to see 
18-year-old boys come in wounded who 
shouldn't have been wounded. I've 
learned to minimize and forget a lot of 
memories because it's so . 
unplea-
sant."
