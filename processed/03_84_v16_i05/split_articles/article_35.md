RenegaCies and Troublemakers 
Gerald Bruck 
I'm told there's a 
feeling 
school is dull and aimless 
now, whereas in the sixties 
we had ideas, purpose, pas-
sion; that causes were worth 
it then and not today. Is this 
true? Does anybody really 
think that? As I remember 
the golden age we were 
typically young and stupid 
and unprepared 
for 
the 
education we were offered. (I 
hope this wasn't only me.) 
Anyway: 
Magazines in 1964 said the 
world of youth had now 
begun. 
The elders 
were 
jumping to the sidelines, 
watching our arrival with 
awe. Cdlleges were "impossi-
ble" to get into; the new Ivy 
Leaguers 
would 
be 
"brilliant." I'd dreamed in 
hi ~h school 
of winding 
autumn roads, the weekend 
company of smart and 
perfect-looking girls, the dai-
ly 
fellowship of friendly 
geniuses and all of this and everything around us obscured 
in a golden, historical kind of mist. Admissions Director 
Inslee Clark, another dreamer, let me in. 
I met some classmates and realized we were an ordinary 
bunch after all. Yet waiting for us just inside the gates were 
famous teachers and officials of the University, a Greek 
chorus of J ewish mothers disguis~!d as elegant old WASPs, 
telling us how special we were, how brilliant, how needed 
by the world. This strange sermon was preached by adults 
who must have known better, employed by an outfit whose 
motto was Light and Truth. It was Yale's way of minting its 
own Chosen. "Freshman: look on your God! H e's bigger 
and better-connected than anybody else's, and He loves on-
ly you." 
Activities 
I heard Bob Dylan sing "Mr. Tambourine Man" in 
Woolsey Hall before the record came out. I met Alexander 
Kerensky. On field trips for "Rocks & Stars" (that is, 
geology and astronomy intros, the easiest way past science 
requirements) I discovered we were specks in time, living 
on a giant shifting granite geosyncline. I turned my visiting 
seventeen-year-old brother on to marijuana in 1966 and 
marvelled at his ability to keep laughing no matter how 
many serious people I introduced him to (he seemed to find 
the Dean especially amusing). We had the Beatles, fresh, 
through &rgeant Pepptr. 
The University-sanctioned way to court the female was 
48 The New .Journal/Man·h 2, 1984 
the weekend "mixer." College 
girls arrived 
Fridays on 
chartered buses. The boys 
formed a double-line from 
street to residential college 
dance floor and the visitors 
walked the gauntlet of our in-
solent eyes. Beer drinking 
and dancing followed; Yale 
had an unwritten agreement 
allowing it to violate the city's 
liquor laws. 
Trips to female turf were a 
private enterprise. They were 
called "road trips." Go ahead 
and laugh, go ahead and 
~narl, but College was just 
boys, so you went campaign-
ing for a woman's touch . 
Even 
from 
those crazy 
women, who had no sense of 
what they were, only what 
they wanted to be. Hunting 
grounds of choice like Smith 
or Vassar were .far away, and 
road-trip crashes 
topped

suicide and mountaineering 
accidents as the leading cause 
of undergraduate mortality. 
It could be bleak, being Yalies together. One consolation 
was the Yale Dai(v News, of which our class produced a very 
dull version. 
One reason for this was that the fvews, with its own stone 
building, panelled boardroom, and oversized attention 
from the outside world, stood in for student government 
and many of our most t•ncrgetic members were politicians 
before they were journalists or entertainers .• The trademark 
of the News politician in my day was bland, precocious 
solemnity. He loved the big issues and he loved to fill up 
space, which was how one rose through the ranks. Our 
front page was standard college mess: a visiting lecturer 
reduced and misunderstood, the central fact of a news story 
completely overlooked, the wrong thing covered in the first 
place. Even so, we inmates wanted to take over the asylum. 
The News focused on education: reform of the grading 
system, an undergraduate say in tenure decisions, cur-
riculum changes, coeducation. 
Kingman Brewstt·t· was Yale's new president, an impec-
cably dressed man. Soon Prokssor Lynd would be among 
the first Americans in H anoi, aiding and comforting the 
enem)': later Chaplain Collin would offer a campus church 
as sannuary to draft resisters, while the thousands of rich 
old men who financed Yale threatened to storm to gates. 
Brt·wster's speeches were written in numbing generalities 
that took on meaning only through the exegeses of others, 
imnpretations he remained free to deny. He'd even
