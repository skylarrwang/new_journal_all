**The Uncomfortable Gospel**
**Author: Anne Applebaum**
**Page number(s): 29-30**

Reverend Coffin turns from his window 
overlooking 122nd Street, and with 
characteristic irony says, "When I'm in-
troduced, it's always, 'who became 
famous in the sixties,' as if I'd slipped or 
disappeared." He smiles. "You know 
what I mean- they say, 'here he is, less 
hair, gained a little around the waist.' 
Of course, I think I'm working harder 
than ever, but I guess it's only if you're 
on TV, then you're really doing some-
thing." 

Yet undeniably, as Yale Chaplain 
from 1958 to 1974, William Sloane Cof-
fin did become famous in the sixties. 
"The greatest sin in the world is to be 
boring," Coffin said in 1967. The image 
of him exhorting Yale students to resist 
the draft, waging verbal warfare with 
Kingman Brewster, and going to jail in 
protest remain the epitome of Yale in 
the sixties for many students whose lives 
he affected, as well as for alumni who 
looked on in horror. He was castigated 
as a corrupter of youth, characterized 
both as excessively flamboyant and 
tremendously dedicated, and immor-
talized by Gary Trudeau as Doontsbury's 
"fighting young priest who can talk to 
the young." 

Yale was forewarned . Richard Se-
wall, a former Yale English professor, 
remembers Coffin telling the Yale 
Chaplain Search Committee, .. 1 preach 
the uncomfortable gospel." As soon as 
he arrived, Coffin began to fulfill his 
promise, not an easy job in a secular 
university setting, especially one as con-
servative as Yale in 1958. He remem-
bers his job requiring him to .. take peo-
ple who have roots in faith and try to 
show them that the purpose of having 
roots is to grow branches. At Yale you 
take the majority of students- those 
with branches-and teach them to 
develop roots. I discovered that it's 
easier to develop branches from roots." 

Despite what he calls the "dullness" of 
the fifties, Coffin realized early on that 
problems which were dormant had to 
emerge. Civil rights in particular was a 
movement whose time had come. Cof-
fin's 
dislike of racism 
began 
in 
childhood, was exacerbated by the ar-
my, and became his most important 
cause after he was arrested and jailed 
for taking his first "Freedom Ride" in 
the back of a segregated bus in Mon-
tgomery, Alabama. He laughs recall-
ing, "I didn't think that Freedom Ride 
would be all that big a deal. I just 
thought it was something I should be 
doing. But after that I was a civil rights 
expert, so I had to quickly do a lot more 
reading." 

When he returned to New H aven 
after being jailed in Montgomery, Cof-
fin not only got publicity for civil rights, 
but a great deal of criticism from alum-
ni and certain members of the Yale ad-
ministration. Stephen Buck, then Yale's 
provost, asked for his resignation: "It's 
damned undignified for the chaplain of 
the university to go to jail." Coffin was 
deluged with hate letters and anony-
mous phone calls. He was criticized for 
mixing religion with 
politics, 
especially for dragging Yale's name into 
political squabbles and the limelight of 
national media attention. None of the 
criticism affected him in the slightest, 
except perhaps to make him angrier. 
"It was no accident that other campuses 
were blowing up and Yale was calm and 
civilized." 

C riticism grew to condemnation, 
however, when Coffin became aware of 
the Vietnam War, and the newly 
emergent resistance movement. He 
conducted a church service at Battell 
C hapel during which sixty resisters 
burned their draft cards. Coffin really 
had gone too far, even for an increas-
ingly liberal Yale administration. About 
this time, his famous series of confron-
tations with Yale President Kingman 
Brewster began. Although both men 
claim a great deal of respect for one 
another, Coffin recalls his relationship 
with Brewster as "tifTy. I got on his 
nerves-a lot. I would say to him, 
'Aren't you lucky you have me around 
to say all the things you're dying to say 
but you can't because you're president?' 
He accused me of being strident, and I 
think he was probably correct." 

Coffin's stance against Vietnam 
resulted in an indictment in 1968 for 
assisting draft evasion, a trial in Boston 
which attracted national media atten-
tion, and an uproar among alumni who 
threatened to cut ofT their support for 
Yale. But C_offin's liberal image may 
have helped the University more than 
the alumni realized. "It was no accident 
that other campuses were blowing up 
and Yale was calm and civilized," said 
John Wilkinson, Secretary of Yale. 

At Yale's most volatile moment, 
when 13,000 demonstrators came to 
New Haven on May Day 1970 to pro-
test the jailing of Black Panther leader 
Bobby Seale, Brewster welcomed them 
with open arms, and Coffin made sun-
the demonstrators 
were 
fed 
ancf 
sheltered. "My interest was not in sav-
ing Yale," Coffin remembers, "but in 
keeping attention where 
it 
should 
be-namely, on Washington." 

Coffin was anxious to avoid what IH· 
calls the "misdirected" anger against rlw 
administration which was so potent .11

Coffin and playwright Arthur Miller 
lead over 5,000 people in an an ti-
war protest on the New Haven 
Green. 
"I would say to Brewster, 'Aren't you lucky 
to have me around to say all the things 
you're dying to say but can't because you're 
president?'" 
Manhattan parents, and his childhood 
included years spent in Paris and 
Geneva, and at Andover and Yale. 
There was talk of a possible career as a 
concert pianist. "But one can always 
transcend one's background." he says. 
"The war made a democrat out of me, 
with a small "d" if you will." Not that 
Collin's war career was particularly 
average either; he not only spent time 
in the infantry, but also served as an ar-
my intelligence officer , and later as a 
C IA agent, mostly due to his ability to 
learn nearly fluent Russian in three 
months. H e remembers being "very 
much a Cold Warrior," in those days. 
Only Yale Divinity School, Union 
Theological Seminary, and marriage to 
Arthur Rubinstein's daughter Eva set-
tled him down enough to become 
chaplain of Andover, Williams and 
finally Yale. 

The diversity of Coffin's background 
and interests, and his u nusual ability to 
bridge 
the gaps between different 
worlds is perhaps what stands out most 
strongly in the memories of Coffin's 
friends. W ilkinson recalls driving back 
to New H aven with Coffin after both 
had spent the night in jail after a 1963 
Baltimore civil 
r ights 
p r otest 
demonstration, and asking Coffin to 
slow down. "I'm sorry," replied Coffin, 
"I have to have dinner with J ock 
Whitney," one of the most powerful 
financial magnates in America. Coffin 
remembers telling Whitney, "I don't 
know what's more real, Jock, sleeping 
on the floor of that Baltimore jail or 
sleeping on 
you r 
monogrammed 
sheets."H is ability to JO<:late to extremely 
disparate groups of people helped Cof-
fin attain the mediator's status he held 
at Yale in the sixties. H is aristocratic 
background and liberal convictions 
enabled him to talk with both conser-
vative alumni and radical students, and 
his army and C IA records allowed him 
to denounce the Vietnam War without 
being called a traitor. 

In 
this 
respect , 
hasn't 
changed. Today, he is the senior 
minister of Riverside Church, an im-
posing edifice along the Hudson. River-
side was buill with R ockefeller money, 
but Coffin's congregation of 3,000 is 
one-third black, one-third H ispanic, 
and one-third white. H is vocal sixties 
activism had been translated in to the 
more subdued job of running the
