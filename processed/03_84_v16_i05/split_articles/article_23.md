Persh's death caused his friends, it also 
brought a new awareness of the war 
which they had hardly thought about 
two years before. "It was the first time I 
thought what a waste this is," recalls 
Mack Bradford. "The feeling was no 
longer 'what's going on over there?' It 
was, 'Oh God, this is real."' Others had 
similar reactions. "It contributed to the 
futility. It brought home the senseless-
ness. It crystalized my feelings of the 
waste involved in that effort," accor-ding to Stanberry. "I was ambivalent 
to the war at th.e time we graduated-
If I had a view, it was probably more 
pro than con- but by 1968 and Persh's 
death, all that changed." 

The funeral tOok place in New York 
on February 27. Most of the old clique 
,., was there: Laidley, Bradford, Cross, 
Dalby, Stanberry, 
Howard. 
After 
the ceremony, several of them boarded 
a private plane with the coffin and flew 
to Washington. A funeral cortege met 
them at the airport and carried them to 
Arlington National Cemetery where 
Lieutenant Pershing was buried with 
full military honors. 

After the coffin was lowered into the 
ground, the group flew back to New 
York in time for cocktails and dinner. 
It was the last time they were all 
together.

continue to spread the good word about apple 
pie, motherhood, the .flag-and the glory of 
the great American way to a body of people 
who share their dirt floor with chickens, P~t:s 
and water b~ffalo. No, I'm not b~t:.for flower 
power, but you can't force feed a programmed 
system to people who work on a candle power 
land- no matter what the tall 1 e.>. an ltlYf . ..
