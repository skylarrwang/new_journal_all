Bo, of the monolithic mandible, 
... A 
thought from 
the 
mysterious 
East . . . Happy New Year and all trite 
things that are customarily uttered at this time 
of tlu year. How was your Christmas? There 
is no way it could have compared to an evening 
in the T a little over a year ago when you and 
your elf had your finest hour. Many moons ago 
and Jar away . . . 
We have run a couple of operations over here 
and the battalion was bloodied two days after 
Christmas . .. 
Richard 
W. 
Pershing, 
Lieutenant, 
lOlst Airborne. Division, United States 
Army, had seen his friends for the last 
time barely a month before at the Yale-
Harvard football game. It somehow 
made sense that Persh, as his friends 
called him, would see the group for the 
last time at The Game. For even though 
~e never ceased poking fun at tradi-
tiOns, he could not seem to escape them 
either. 

As his father before him, Persh at-
tended Yale where he stood out as much 
for his flamboyant personality as for his 
athletic prowess. On Tap Day, in the 
spring of '65, he was selected to par-
ticipate in one of the most traditional 
aspects of a tradition-bound institution, 
Skull and Bones. And when Persh left 
~ale, he decided to enlist in the army, 
like his father and his grandfather, 
General J ohn J. "Black J ack" Pershing, 
Commander of American Forces in 
World War L His friends remember 
that_ Persh never bragged about his 
famtly but, as one of his close friends 
recalls, "There was no other honorable 
thing for him to do but join the army. It 
was a legacy for him as much as being 
at Yale was a legacy for him." 

Yale in 1966 was not radically dif-
ferent from the Yale of the 1950s. Peo-
ple still wore ties to dinner. The resi-
dential colleges had guards posted at 
gates that were left unlocked. There 
were no women either. "Ironically, the 
war was almost a non-issue at that 
time," fellow Bonesman Chip Stanberry 
recalls. "It was distant, almost non-
existent, not something worth thinking 
about, certainly not something worth 
protesting about." 

Persh formed many special bonds 
with his fellow members of Skull and 
Bones: Mack Bradford, the Captain of 
the lacrosse team, Michael Dalby, a 
scholarly intellectual studying Asian 
history, Ron Singer, Phi Beta Kappa 
graduating 3rd in his 
class, Jim 
Howard, a lacrosse player and offensive 
halfback on the football team. "We 
shared a lot of emotions," recalls Dave 
Laidley, the captain of the football 
team, dubbed "Bo of the Monolithic 
Mandible" by Persh. "It was a highly 
charged, very candid year." All of the 
original group have been successful: 
some have gone on to national prom-
inance: J ohn Kerry, now the Lieute-
nant Governor of Massachusetts and 
Freddie Smith, 
the president and 
founder of Federal Express. The group 
met twice weekly and spent much time 
together outside of their society. 

Persh was not the only person in 
Bones that year who went to Vietnam. 
John Kerry," David Thorne and Fred 
Smith also saw combat. They went 
partly out of curiosity and also because 
"He had this crazy kind of luck and ability. 
We all thought this pluckiness would get 
him through Nam." 
they didn't want to go to graduate 
school or Canada, the only alternatives 
to military service for young men just 
out of college. "We were all, even Persh, 
interested in the question of war in our 
generation. Would you run away or 
would you go deal with it, look at it?" 
David T horne, another Bonesman who 
served as an officer in the Navy recalls. 
"There was a certain adventure about 
it." 

Of all the Bonesmen who served in 
Vietnam, Persh was the only one who 
did not return. Now, a white tombstone 
sits atop a hill overlooking Washington, 
D.C. It is isolated from the rows upon 
rows of similar slabs which dot the land-
scape of Arlington National Cemetery 
like daisies in a spring pasture. OfT in 
the distance are the Washington Monu-
ment and the United States Capitol. 
Persh's tombstone stands in a small 
clearing near the grave of his grand-
father, one of the country's great war 
heroes and the namesake of the Per-
shing II missile. 

. .. In the same fi.refight a Huey 1-B gun-
ship (helicopter) was blown om of the 
sky-carbonizing two pilots and two gunners. 
I cam'ed one of the bodies in to be taken back 
by chopper-and was shaken by that as I have 
ever been in my short life. The immediacy of 
death is startling. One man was shot through 
the temple so it was instantaneous but ug!Ji as 
sin. Now it seerns remote and almost not im-
portant, but at the time, it twists you up in-
side . .. 

At a lean 6'2", Persh cut a dashing 
figure 
on campus. 
His theatrical 
mannerisms and wild antics gave him a 
high profile both in and out of Pierson 
College. In Skull and Bones, Persh was 
iconoclast, 
the one who kept 
everybody from taking themselves too 
seriously. "Suddenly he'd be Nigel, a 
character he invented in a debate at 
Mory's, with an English accent," recalls 
Laidley. "H e'd pick up a soup bowl and 
use it for a helmet. 'Nigel standing at 
the head of the Sahara sands,' he'd say." 

Inside the H all on High Street, few of 
the solemn rituals of Skull and Bones 
escaped Persh's ridicule. "We'd get to 
taking it all a little too seriously, and 
suddenly he'd be Cyrano de Bergerac," 
adds Laidley. "H e'd slap somebody with 
a glove and challenge them to a duel." 

In a time conspicuously devoid of 
protests or inspired causes, Persh's 
friends remember him for his warmth 
and generosity. Born into a prominent 
New York family on October 25, 1942, 
Persh was the son of a successful stock 
. broker who was well-known in New 
York social circles. The family had a 
large apartment on Park Avenue and a 
summer house in Southampton. Persh 
often liked to treat h_is friends at one of 
his favorite spots in the city. 

"He knew all the good bars on the 
East Side," says j im H oward. "H e could 
go to Trader Vic's without money 
becau se everyone knew him there." 

Often the group wou ld end up sleeping 
in the City at the Pershings' place after 
Persh had treated everyone to dinner 
and drinks. "We used to call those our 
Trader V ic's seminars," recalls Laidley. 
These trips were an important time for 
Persh and his friends to get together. 
"H e was the catalyst for that whole 
grou p," recalls M ary Ann Howard, j im 
H oward's wife. "H e was the one who 
would call and get them all together." 

At times, Persh's antics bordered on 
the reckless. Howard recalls flying back 
to New Haven on Fred Smith's private 
plane, after a party on Long Island . "At 
one point, I looked up and Persh was at 
the controls. I'm certain he'd never 
flown anything before, but he insisted 
on doing it." Stunts like this both am-
used and annoyed Persh's friends. "tie 
was so delightful and funny, you 
couldn't get mad at him," recalls Ron 
Singer. "H e could flick cigarette ashes 
on your clothes and you had to laugh." 

. . . This is an ugry, amorplwus on again, 
qff again war. When in base camp, its touch 
football, beer and bridge- On our operations 
it.r sw~at, slogging Lhrou.~h lcnee deep wale" in 
the paddies, vicious red ants and bugs. Tht 
heat is ungodry dun"ng the day and while it 
cools off at night, the mosquitoes have been 
known to band together and carry men and 
machines off . . . 

Persh's friends recall that he never 
worked very hard at anything, prefer-
ring instead to rely on his natural grace 
and intelligence. Often he would stay 
out late drinking and smoking cigar-
ettes the night before a lacrosse or soc· 
cer game and deliver a stellar perfor· 
mance on the field the next day. "He 
was serious about the-.games, but he 
partied hard after them," recalls Mack 
Bradford. Persh brought his antics out 
onto the field as well. "We used to carry 
him out onto the field in a laundry 
basket. H e'd get out' and dance around 
in 
a 
really 
funny 
way," Kerry 
remembers. 

Exams were always a crisis. "He used 
to hit the infirmary during exams: 
Laidley says. Despite the u nending 
academic crisis, Persh graduated with a 
BA in English. "H e didn't have much in 
common with the English metaphysical 
poets, but I guess he liked them: 
Michael Dalby says, remembering the 
drawn out cram sessions he and Persh 
had together. After their last exam, the 
Bones group took a trip to Deer Island, 
the StK'i<'ty's private island on the St. 

Lawrence R iver. Thev returned to New 
Haven after only a few days to hear 
Kerry deliver the Class Day speech. 

Looking ba<·k on those close calls, 
Persh's friends remember that pan of 
his charm was his ability to get out of 
tight situations. "lie was the kind of guy 
who could write excellent term papers 
on subjects he knew nothing about," 
recalls AI Cross, a fellow Bonesman. 

Academic trouble was not the only pro-
blem Persh got himself into. Howard 
tells ho"" ht· and Pt·rsh wound up in 
Grand Central Station om• morning at 
5:00 a.m. afrt•r a long night on the 
tovm. They had spent all of tht·rr money 
and had no ""•l\ to get back to New 
Haven. Pt·...-h approached somebody in 
one of the caflott•rias and <·on" inced him 
to lend tht·rn SIO .. He "'as ah .. ays get-

T o some of hr., fnends, it st·emed as if 
Pe...-h had a guardian angel. .. He had 
this craz\ kind of luck and ability,~ 
Laidley <;ays 
.. We all thought this 
pluckiness would 
get 
him through 
Nam."
