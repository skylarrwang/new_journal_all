EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
To the Editor:

It was with considerable disappointment and frustration that I read your article, "Lana: A Story of Scarlet Letters and Public Risks" that appeared in the December 9th issue of The New journal.

Yale University has always been a champion of the rights of the individual, stressing the uniqueness, importance and dignity of each person. Therefore it was extremely disappointing to find a Yale student publishing information in a Yale journal that ignores these basic values. You can certainly argue strongly that in the current epidemic of AIDS the public has a right to know any epidemiological information that may help prevent theÂ· further dissemination of this serious illness. On the other hand, one would hope that as a responsible journalist you would make sure that in presenting such knowledge to the public you would not risk damaging one or more lives that are already seriously compromised and underprivileged.

Your story is doubly disturbing for apart from the callous disregard of one less fortunate's privacy, you have also been dishonest. Entering the hospital without permission, tracking down a patient whose name and condition were no business of yours, forcing your way into her room and offering to pay her if she would give you her story are all reprehensible acts. While, of course, I cannot prove it, I have reason to believe that the statements made to you by my patient were at best misquoted or perhaps even fabricated. Obviously what was said at that meeting is known only to you and my patient but I know her well and in discussing her problem with her frankly on numerous occasions, she has never suggested that she was unconcerned about her potential for infecting others. She has never verbalized thoughts such as, "It's too late to start worrying about it now." Your publication of such words, carrying with it all the inferences that suggest a lack of concern for one's fellow man, are most unfortunate.

Your photographer had no right to take his photographs inside St. Raphael's Hospital and then compound that violation with the dishonest inference in the article that the isolation room shown was where the baby in question was being kept. A number of readers have commented to us that it seems cruel to have kept the baby in such a small crib for such a long period of time. The fact, of course is that the baby, who is now walking, is not confined in such a manner at all. Obviously the article was read by my patient. In it she reads that the doctors feel that her baby will probably die within the next year. Neither I nor the attending pediatrician on the case believe that. We have never said such a thing to the mother. Obviously her confidence in us is shaken to read such a thing in the press. A cruel and inaccurate statement on your part.

Equally disturbing was your comment that doctors are waiting for her to develop the devastating extreme form of AIDS. Again, all my efforts have been directed in assuring her, on the basis of the strong evidence that we have collected, that were she to avoid further exposure to those situations known to be associated with the risk of contracting AIDS, her disease would be unlikely to progress.

Obviously there have been many breakdowns in the privacy any patient should expect when giving information to medical providers. Much of the information that you have obtained you simply had no right to know and certainly no right to use. Who told you that her routine urine tests had revealed that she was back on heroin and that subsequently she had been dropped from a methadone program? How was it that you could obtain the results of her T cell counts? Your ability to find out such matters obviously makes all the patients with AIDS and AIDS related problems that we care for concerned that confidentiality in their case may break down.

In my mind the whole matter raises serious questions about whether some closer faculty supervision should not be supplied for the work of The New journal. If you use these comments constructively then it is my hope that the bad judgement that you showed on this occasion will not be repeated.

Sincerely, 
John M. Dwyer, M.D., Ph.D.

Since February, Dr. Dwyer has acknowledged to the local press that Yale-New Haven Hospital is currently treating three other patients for early stages of AIDS. In addition, the AIDS clinic has seen three males whose only suspected exposure to AIDS is through contact with prostitutes.
