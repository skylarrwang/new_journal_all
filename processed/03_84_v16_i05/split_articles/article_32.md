More than an occasional stammer of 
fear accompanied me back to Yale after 
my two· year sabbatical in the Army-a 
fear that time had diluted my brain, 
and still more ominous, a fear that war 
had depraved my sensibilities. What if 
Yale had changed, too? There were too 
many variables to permit a methodical 
readjustment to the place. It had to be a 
matter of blundering. If I had lost my 
youth overseas, if I had lost my in-
tellect, I would just have to stumble 
through the rest of m y education as best 
I could. 

I had been drafted out of law school 
after only a semester and stumbled into 
an improbable labyrinth that twisted 
finally back to its origin. The Vietnam 
maze is "365 days or life, whichever 
comes first," according to the black 
humor of combat. I had been lucky. 
Now I was back, a little less confident 
than before and troubled by a few 
recurring, 
terrifying memories that 
seemed inconsistent with Yale's strong 
stone fortresses, droll stained glass win-
dows and fireplaces in nearly every 
room. 

But perhaps there were even more 
startling similarities lurking here. 
M aybe the maze I'd followed was more 
intricate than extended. That was 
something I'd have to find out in time. 

It was one of those sharp cold nights 
when the snow along the edges of the 
sidewalk squeaks underfoot. I was walk-
ing to a party, smiling anq thinking 
what a wonderful and mysterious stuff 
is snow. (One acquaintance of mine 
who served in Vietnam some years back 
told me he smiled a lot at things like 
snow.) I lit a cigarette. 

' Two years ago I had thought about 
breaking the habit. T~e evidence about 
cigarettes all supported a decision to 
quit. But then I spent an evening with a 
friend on his first leave from army ad-
• vanced infantry training. H e set forth a 
wager there was something to be said 
for postponing a decision about smok-
ing at least until all accounts with the 
Arm'y were settled in full. I must have 
looked unconvinced, because he per· 
sisted. He explained that two yead 
worth of tar and gunk in the lungs 
didn't make much difference in the long 
run, if there was a long run. But, he 
said, what if you were to quit the weed, 
go through the pain and torment of 
withdrawal, forgo the pleasure of that 
first nut-like drag after a satiating meal, 
and then walk into an evil bit of mortar 
shell or bullet that lodges where the 
tumor would have grown? The weight
