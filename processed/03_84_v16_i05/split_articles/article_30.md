**Vietnam: The Defoliation Controversy**

President Nixon's science advisor, Lee 
A. Dubridge, and demanded that the 
!ipraying be stopped. The government 
soon relented. In 1970 the Nixon Ad-
mtn tst rat ion 
officially 
terminated 
Operation Ranch Hand, although some 
unauthorized defoliation continued for 
several years. 

However, 
the long-term en-
vironmental effects of the spraying in 
Vietnam 
still 
concerned Galston. 
"Whether I liked it or not, I was 
hooked," he said. "I had to engage in 
whatever kind of social functioning was 
needed to .set the situation straight." 

When Galston first went to Vietnam 
with Ethan P. Singer of MIT in April of 
1971, he did so with mixed emotions. 
For one thing, the Government viewed 
the trip with considerable displeasure . 
"We were in contact with the Far 
Eastern desk of the State Department," 
said Galston, "and we notified them of 
our intentions to go to North Vietnam. 
The State Department knew the North 
Vietnamese might try to usc us for 
propaganda purposes-which they did. 
For instance, they lead us through an 
American War Crimes Museum in 
which we were shown all sorts of 
deformities supposedly caused bv 
America's use of chemicals. So we got 
the very definite impression that the 
State Department wasn't happy about 
our going. Here I was, an outspoken 
opponent of the defoli~rion program. I 
guess they sensed that if I found 
something and made it public, well, it 
just might light a fuse." 

There were also those at Yale who 
viewed his trip as a political statement 
against United States involvement in 
Vietnam. "I was both applauded and 
casligated," Galston 
remembered. 
"There were even some in the student 
body, who thought I was traitorous for 
going to North Vietnam. I had col-
leagues on our faculty who said I had 
done our country a disservice, science a 
disservice, the University a disservice, 
and so on." And when GaJston sat down 
with President K ingman Brewster and 
notified him of his forthcoming travel 
plans, Brewster was not thrilled about 
the idea. "Brewster said some wry 


thin~s . Sonwthin~ to llw t•flnt that Yak

war was just anotlwr turninl{ ol thl'

Galston has devoted a significant 
portion of his professional 
life 
to 
figuring out how scientists in the future 
m ight avoid similar perversions of their 
discoveries. His numerous writings and 
lectures on bioethics have touched upon 
one central 
theme: 
that 
socially 
concerned scientists must now follow 
their discoveries outside the lab to 
insure that they will not be used for 
destructive ends. "I used to think that 
one could avoid involvement in the 
antisocial 
consequences of science 
sim ply by not working on any project 
that might be turned to evil or des-
tructive ends. I have learned that things 
are not all that simple, and that almost 
any scientific discovery can 
be 
perverted or twisted under appropriate 
societal 
pressures 
The only 
recourse for a scientist concerned about 
the social consequenc:es of his work is to 
remain involved with it to the end ...
