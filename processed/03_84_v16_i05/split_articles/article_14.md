Campaigns of the New Soldier

WASHINGTON DC, April 19, 1971 
- They call it O peration Dewey Can-
yon III, successor to previous military 
moves in Vietnam. Eleven hundred 
men dressed in camouflage march 
towards the Capitol building, some in 
wheelchairs, some on crutches, all call-
ing for an end to fighting in Southeast 
Asia. T hey are the Vietnam Veterans 
Against the War, the first group of 
soldiers in American history to demand 
the end of a war still in progress. Dur-
ing this week some camp out on the 
Mall, some throw their medals on the 
steps of the Capitol and some turn 
themselves into the Pentagon for their 
war crimes. One hundred ten demon-
strators are arrested and later released. 

john Forbes Kerry, a clean-cut Yale 
graduate described as "the least likely 
protester in the entire organization," 
speaks before the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, justifying this "limited 
incursion into the country of Congress." 
Dressed in an olive drab uniform, he 
asks, "H ow do you ask a man to be the 
last man to die in Vietnam? How do 
you ask a man to be the last man to die 
for a mistake?" 

BOSTON MA, January 26, 1984-
Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts 
john Kerry announces his intention to 
run against 
Republican Edward 
Markey for the U.S. Senate seat 
vacated by Paul Tsongas. Kerry hopes 
to return to the country of Congress to 
work inside the Capitol, not on its steps. 
"fve always said basically the same 
thing. I think I'm being true to the 
points of view I came back from Viet-
nam with," Kerry says in his persistent 
baritone. "I think I've grown up a bit 
since then, but my basic thrust is for a 
government that cares for its people, 
cares for the rest of the world , and cares 
to protect itself." 

NEW H AVEN CT, June 12, 1966-
John Kerry addresses his graduating 
class on the Old Campus of Yale 
University. 
"We suddenly 
find 
ourselves ... dubbed the revolutionary 
generation," says Kerry, a member of 
Skull and Bones and the varsity soccer 
team. "This revolution is one of the 
strangest in history, for the revolu-
tionists bear no arms against their 
government, set up no street barricades 
. . . and with remarkably few excep-
tions, initiate no violence ... We are 
all entitled to choose our own battle. 
Society cannot force a man to join a 
fight he doesn't want." 

SOMEWH ERE NEAR THE ME-
KONG DELTA, VIETNAM, April 
1969- Lieutenant John Kerry, one of 
the most decorated naval officers of the 
war, earns his third purple heart for 
shrapnel wounds during his year-long 
tour of duty in Vietnam. Previously an 
officer on a guided missile frigate in the 
Gulf of Tonkin, he has served as the 
skipper of a patrol boat in the Mekong 
Delta. Kerry returns home to Mass-
achusetts, determined to protest against 
a war he has found to be immoral and 
wasteful. 

The tall, brown-haired young man with 
the Irish face was not earmarked for a

even to becoming President. It was very 
much in his political goals to model 
himself after Kennedy." 

career as a radical spokesman against 
the war. Kerry, whose father worked 
with the State Department and Army 
Air Corps during World War II, did not 
participate in anti-war activities as an 
undergraduate. "I think I was fairly 
moderate at that time," he now recalls. 
"I was not yet opposed to the war on 
ideological terms." The year he 
graduated a Yale Political Union poll 
found 
strong student 
support 
for 
continuing the war in Vietnam. Kerry 
had been president of the Union his 
junior year, and served as chairman of 
the Liberal Party and as treasurer of the 
Young Democrats. H e also won several 
oratory prizes, and was a member of 
the Yale Debating Association. 

"As far as I thought, he was, even at 
that time, very ambitious and very 
much one to carve out a political 
... career," said a fellow member of 
Skull and Bones that year. "He wanted 
· to go as far as possible, even to becom-
ing President. It was very much in his 
political goals to model himself after 
Kennedy." 

Kerry had signed a contract with the 
Navy in 1965 as an alternative to going 
to graduate school. He felt a respon-
sibility "to give something back to the 
country." But by the time he arrived in 
Vietnam in 1968, Yale's view of the war 
had changed significantly, and so had 
Kerry's. 

"By the time I went over, there was 
considerable unrest here," he says. "I 
had 
some serious reservations. 
I 
doubted if the United States was follow-
ing actions which could achieve its 
ends, I questioned the legality of the 
government we were working with, and 
I wondered if we should be part of a 
civil war, if we could have any impact 
there. A lot of us in the service were 
asking that at that point, questioning, 
but finding no real answers." He sensed 
a similar uncertainty in the South Viet-
namese. "In the Vietnamese Regional
