developed a languagt' of hurnphing sounds that sounded 
friendly and direct but was not, in fact, composed of words. 
We were living in the nursery of then-powerful men; I 
could feel the strong temptation to want to fit in. Connec-
tions existed. Perhaps 
forclx~aring, we could become 
powerful too. Neophyte politicians who thought like this 
dressed carefully. joim:d the Political Union and sucked up 
to senators. They tended to be Republican and resembled 
the Young Komsomols I met on a summer trip to Russia in 
1966. They didn't seem to notin.: that the action had moved 
elsewhere. 

Movement 
Ours was the first generation since the abolitionists' 10 grow 
up with some sense of the ra(·ist burden of American 
history (and very few of the abolitionists were much con-
cerned with racism). It was a th··ill and a relief to see this 
burden start to lighten. I thought then we were the first to 
see things str·aight. 

Religion at Yale was limp good will and empty chapels; 
the civil rights movement and then the war gave it 
something dignified to do. In 1964, the College was a 
center for student organizing in the South, thanks in part to 
the Campus Ministr·ics and Rev. Coflin. I can see the stu-
dent leaders on a lecture-hall stage, late at night, 1964, 
handsome young men with old-American names like 
Payne and Wilcox. A standing-room-only crowd jams the 
Law School Auditorium. an Emeq:{t:ncy Meeting. A panel-
ist arrives, late and out of breath, straight from a distant 
hot-spot. Another rushes out to arrange bail for· a jailed 
rights-worker in Mississippi. They look tormented. they 
are always exhausted, they are ha,·ing the time of their 
lives. 

Midway between the Political Union and martyrdom 
was a humming zone called Allard Lowenstein. Lowen-
stein, now dead, was a Law Sd10ol graduate, untitled na-
tional politican and a speaker of real bt·illiance. 

AI was always zipping in and ou1. gatherin~ lieutenants 
for crusades- now for the civil rights sit-ins, now against 
SNCC, now to influence the President, now to dump John-
son. His method was the familiar "you. you, and only you" 
(are great; can run the world) coupled ''ith inside info on 
Communist conspiracies among people you thought you 
could trust and vague promises of a pt·ivate meeting with 
Lyndon Johnson next week. 

AI was tomorrow's Washington. a real Hollywood pro-
ducer. You never knew what the hell was going on, what 
with midnight meetings and phone calls to the moon, but 
whatever it was, it was fa:.cinating. Polite, isolated 
moralists were drawn as if by ma~nets toward the flame of 
power, drawn by dreams .and the confusing glow of Al's 
deeply-veiled homosexual advances. 

Selma, Alabama 
I remember being 17, standing 111 my dat·kcncd room, 
looking through the window at the ghostly winter trees on 
the Old Campus. In a breath it will be next year, in a 
breath school will be over, in a b1·eath it will be twenty 
years from now. My freshmen friends and I were doing our 
homework, heeling the News, and growing daily dully slug-
gardized at Yale the winter of early '65. Outside our gates 
the world was breathing, turning, changing, while we 
played Requirement, manipulating abstractions, ignorant 
of whatever realities the symbols were supposed to repre-
sent, and knowing it. 

The newspapers were full of gory sensation from 
Alabama, Martin Luther King, a coming voting rights 
march. The Campus Ministry provided warnings, the 
Chairman of the News typed out a press card, and I set out 
on my first-ever independent trip on an airplane. 

I landed at the Montgomery airport in the aftermath of 
beatings there. The few agitators around tried not !O stand 
out and we waited for a convoy of cat·s the way people in a 
burning building wait for the ladder and try to keep calm. 
This airport felt planets away from any kind of government 
I'd learned about in high school. In it I thought thoughts 
like, does it hurt to have your teeth kicked out? How would 
I behave when danger arrived? What does pride cost? How 
much for loyalty? 

This threat of lead pipes and kicks was new, and it stayed 
new, day after day. Press attention protected the marchers 
from Selma to Montgomery, but fmm that visit on I could 
imagine what it might be like clsewhe,·e, or have been like 
before. Within a week my eyes had changed for good. 

Businessmen, officials, community leaders, well-dt-essed 
men who didn't look much different from our fathers 
behaved with a viciousness I would never have believed at 
second hand. The police were much worse. It started as a 
vision of the end of everything, in this decent, known, 
American place. And then a motley crowd's passive 
resistance worked a kind of magic in the world. It was as if 
a crack was opening in reality, and the adrenalin of all our 
favorite songs could rule the future. 

The non-violent struggle has come and gone. Some 
writers have belittled its nature and achievements. \YelL it 
was something to see! The organizers in Mississippi (a 
place so mean I saw blacks in Jackson scoot at my ap-
proach, from the sidewalk to the gutter, as if guided by in-
visible rails), the voter registration workers and the 1964 
"Freedom Summer" educators, the locals who dared to 
follow and then to lead, will remain for me the heroes of my 
generation. 

Reverend King still led events in Selma, but tensions 
between black and white, young and old, reformer and 
revolutionary, were just then bubbling up within the move-
ment. Blacks our a~e were getting sick of having the 
glorious roles stolen. Racial culture became an issue. As dP 
jw. ,cgrco:ation died. the choice of the next direction started 
to matta. Battle lines sprang up everywhere. Everyone 
sounded convincin~ to me.

I watched all this, moving through the barricades and 
scribbling notes for the News. I returned determined to 
learn what it was all about. My South stories got me on the 
News and Staughton Lynd admitted me to his survey of 
Southern history. 

Assistant Professor Lynd was a radical. He argued the 
existence of a moral code to which everyone everywhere 
was accountable. This sounded Christian to me, but he 
said it was independent of revealed religion. Demands of 
the state could not diminish personal responsibility. The 
historian's job was to find traditions and heroes to inspire 
the crushed. One of his extracurricular preoccupations was 
encouraging the poor and illiterate to record their stories, 
filling a perennial gap in the primary sources for future 
historians. His life over the past five years was wove.n with 
the Movement's. 

Crowds turned up at Lynd's office hours, filling the 
folding metal chairs that ringed his study, each visitor 
speaking in turn. There were white civil rights workers, 
unsure of their role in the face of Black Power; students 
with draft dilemmas; Christians in a crisis of belief; adver-
saries eager to tell him off; grinning undergraduates 
desperate for term paper extensions. 

If the matter was substantial, Lynd would hear his 
visitor out and meticulously summarize what he had heard, 
sometimes adding what he thought was meant or implied. 
Then Staughton would say what he thought. Perhaps he 
would suggest the nature of a choice. He allowed everyone 
his mystery and gave full, sympathetic attention. In this 
way he disarmed his enemies and made us all simpler. 

VIetnam 
By the fall of '66 the war was poisoning life at school. It 
started with the tightening noose of the draft, which in 
combination with the automatic exemption for full-time 
undergraduates, trapped what began t? seem like half the 
class on campus. Our situation grew so alarming that it led 
to thinking. Disaffection spread not because our leaders 
proved stupid, corrupt, and cruel, which they did, but 
because they started coming after us. 

I think we had enough energy to fight two wars-
haven't you felt the urge? Hence the later macho posture-
"going to war against the war makers" became a slogan. I 
think many of us envied our fathers the clear and evil threat 
they'd been given to meet, the contribution they'd been 
allowed, the solidarity of their generation. But this war was 
something else. 

No one seemed to know for sure what it was even about. 
Was it against Communism? Was it against China without 
having to fight in China? Was it to help Vietnamese have a 
better life? Was it to use them as cannon fodder for our 
global strategy? Or was the goal of each new escalation to 
protect the Gls who were already over there? (A lot of peo-
ple were hypnotized by Johnson into forgetting that the Gls 
were endangered in Vietnam because Johnson kept ship-
ping them to Vietnam.) 

It very slowly dawned on us we weren't just in the wrong 
spot but on the wrong sick in the wrong spot, trying to 
rescue a feudal order many times worse than anything that. 
had provoked the American Revolution. What looked at 
first like bad management revealed itself as evil. Our 
elected leaders were war criminals, personally responsible 
for hundreds of thousands of murders. They shamed our 
country to the world and undermined its faith in itself. 

Hundreds of thousands with the innocence or sense of duty 
to follow them were left in their wake, maimed in body or 
in spirit. These creeps step out in public today with their 
heads held high. They've never even apologized. 

T he political spectrum seemed to split between gangsters 
and outlaws, with less and less in between. The lies from 
the top became increasingly lazy, as if Americans were 
morons who'd believe anything. So much for the illusion 
that law, words, logic or morality ruled the world, or at 
least our side's part of it. Much later on, when it finally 
became apparent that tomorrow's leaders were getting too 
alienated, acting too outrageous in greater and greater 
numbers, 

Brewster-types recast themselves as social 
healers, against the war at last because it caused division at 
home. 

A Field Trip 
In early 1966, Staughton assigned me a paper on the 
political odyssey of Julian Bond, a black state legislator and 
leading member of SNCC . .Julian read what I wrote and 
invited me to co-author another stab at his memoirs, the 
publisher's advance for which he'd long since spent. 

That's another thing about those ti~es: we could do 
anything, anything at all, everything was possible. To ex-
pose the world was to change it. Everyone was welcome to 
help draw the new map, even sophomores. 

J ulian had been elected w the Georgia legislature from 
Atlanta in 1965 only to be barred for endorsing an anti-war 
statement. An historic voting reform had made his election 
possible; now the Georgia House was putting Soviet-style 
limits on what this newcomer could actually say or do. It 
took the US Supreme Court to set this straight. The inci-
dent seemed an omen of the pro-war orthodoxy LBJ was 
trying to promote, and it became a national issue. 

My task was to detail the State's doings in this affair. In 
early 1967 I lugged my files to Atlanta ro prove my hunches 
about the political establishment's secret machinations. To 
do this I needed to move in high circles, put in time by the 
spittoon, banter with secretaries, whatever. But how do 
you make friends with Lester I\.1addox, who was famous for 
beating blacks away from his chicken restaurant with an ax 
handle and who'd just become Governor? There wasn't 
anything in the library on that. (These people may sound 
like jokes wday, but they weren't at the time, believe me.) 

Then I learned that Maddox's Executive Secretary was a 
Yalic, he'd majored in sociology. I invented a Yale Daily 
News series on "distinguished alumni" and asked for an in-
terview. ''Terrific," said the Maddox man- I'll call him 
Buddy-but first he insisted on showing me a good time 
and there was no getting out of it. 

There were four of us. Willie, who resembled Slim 
Pickens as last seen riding an H-bomb into the clouds over 
Russia, was the college freshman son of one of Buddy's 
business associates. Buddy procured two girls from the 
Governor's office. Mine ehe<.:kcd Maddox's letters, wrote 
some of them, and was authorized to sign. H er name was 
Kate. 

Buddy fed us at a Chinese restaurant and brought us 
back to the Democratic Party's suite at the Henry Grady 
Hotel, where he took a guitar off the wall and sang the 
"Lester Maddox Fight Song- South Georgia version, not 
for publication." 

"Mmmm! Are we eve1· going to have fun!" said Willie as 
Buddy released us with one of the Governor's cars. Willie 
drove it around, on two wheels, for a while. It turned out 
that to have fun you had to "get a bottle." 

But if God was sound asleep and all of our parents far 
away, the liquor store clerks took us for the teenagers we 
were, so Willie led us back to the H enry Grady, where we 
found Buddy, and he went out and bought liquor for us. In 
a suburban parking lot near a children's night club called 
the Comic Strip, at the point of taking our first sip, we were 
arrested by two hundred cops guided by aircraft landing 
lights. 

Here's your researcher, inside a windowless police van 
racing through Atlanta at what feels like 100 mph, but 
nobody's singing "We Shall Overc<;>me," they're singing the 
"Lester Maddox Fight Song!" 

"They're going to ask us, 'Who bought the stufl?"' said 
Willie, as the chief radioed ahead to "make accommoda-
tions for two white girls and their escorts." 

"And what do we say? I've got it. We say that we saw a 
nigger on the street and he went and bought it for us, 
rightr 

Kate was sure our connections would get us out, but 
Maddox had campaigned in the countryside against Atlan-
ta and its soft cops. The city's police and politicans hated 
him. More, Governor Maddox was a Bible-thumping tee-
totaler. \".'here would that leave our host? 

"All right, where'd you 
~et the booze?" asked the 
sergeant. "Don't fool around with me or you'll really be in 
trouble.~ 

"Freshman: look on your God! H e's bigger 
and better-connected than anybody else's, 
and H e loves only you ."
