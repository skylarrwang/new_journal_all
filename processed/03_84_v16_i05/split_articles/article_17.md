An Army M.D:s Second Opinion 
Joyce Banerjee 
In one room of the large Victorian 
house in Middlebury, Connecticut, 
portraits of past Yale fencing teams line 
the wall. On a nearby bookcase, Anthony Grey's Saigon leans against a 
volume of Cmtury of Surgery. Close to the 
bookcase stands the slide screen. Dr. 
Kristaps Keggi of the Yale School of 
Medicine leans forward in his chair and 
presses the control button. The slide 
snaps into place. 

A group of white-coated men hides 
the soldier's face. His arm lies over the 
edge of the stretcher, and someone's 
hands rest delicately on his throat. His 
chest is tan and hairless, his pants tattered and muddy, and each of his thickly 
bandaged legs ends just below the 
knee. 

"They arrived by helicopter like this," 
says Keggi, "I operated on this guy five 
times and I couldn't save him." 

"The daily picture of the wounded 
was this soldier coming in. He was a 
radio operator hit by a Claymore mine: 
a little gadget that looks like a cigar box. 
It explodes into high velocity pellets, 
and it's close enough and low enough to 
blow the legs off. Everyone in his squad 
was wounded. He put on his own tourniquets, crawled to his radio, calibrated 
it and called in the helicopters. He 
stayed on the radio until every last man 
was evacuated. He was the last one 
brought in. He developed a malignant 
infection in his legs similar to gangrene, 
and it spread up and up and up ... " 

Dr. Keggi walks to the back of the 
room and turns on the lights. The tall, 
silver-haired man does not resemble the 
stereotypical anguished Vietnam survivor. His memories do not torment 
him. Rather, Keggi lives comfortably 
with his decision to serve in Vietnam 
and to return to a Yale violently opposed 
to the war. 

Born in Latvia in 1934, Kristaps 
Keggi grew up in the midst of World 
War II. Fleeing from the Russian Army, 
Keggi's family moved to Germany 
when he was ten. He still remembers 
the sound of planes strafing a train and 
the saturation bombings of Cologne. In 
1949, his family left Europe for the 
United States. Two years later Keggi 
entered Yale. He majored in French 
and was a nationally ranked fencer. 
Graduating in 1955, he studied surgery 
at Yale School of Medicine, where he 
later received his commission from the 
Army. 

In 1964, Keggi joined the Army and 
taught orthopedic surgery in El Paso, 
Texas. Then in February, 1965, he was 
placed on 12 hour alert, issued a duffle 
bag and rifle and asked to make out his 
will. Keggi left in August for Indochina 
with the 173rd Airborne Division, the 
first regular Army unit deployed in the 
Vietnam war. 

He had no moral qualms with 
American involvement in Southeast 
Asia. "We were there for a very 
idealistic reason: to give the average 
Vietnamese the chance for self-determination. I believe in that 100 percent," 
he explains. "We had no intention of 
staying in Vietnam as a colonial power. 
Had South Vietnam remained, 
it 
would've been like West Germany or 
South Korea. Under our system, the 
average Vietnamese would've had a lot 
"There was so much emotionalism over the 
war that, instead of seeing shades of grey, 
people would call you a fascist pig." 
more choice in what he wanted to do 
than under any other system." 

Upon his arrival in Saigon, Dr. 
Keggi traveled 15 miles north to Bien 
Hoa, the site of the Third Surgical Army 
Hospital. Quickly, Keggi realized 
he would not be working in ideal conditions. The hospital consisted of canvas 
tents arranged in a rectangle, with an 
artillery unit uncomfortably close by. 
Dust blew into the operating rooms 
from flights at a nearby airstrip. The 
unit had no blood storage facilities, and 
medicine was often limited. As Keggi 
remembers, the first time he asked for 
plaster of Paris, the corpsman gave him 
a box containing enough plaster for a 
half-dozen casts- the unit's entire supply. 

Though later in the war many physicians would protest any doctor's support 
of the Army-"an organization whose 
primary function is to kill"- Keggi does 
not see a conflict between his Hippocratic oath and his military career. 
Rather, he believes that his war experience proved to him the importance 
and humanity of his profession. "Our 
achievement in Vietnam was the saving 
of arms and legs and lives," says Keggi. 
"We were sending people back to walk 
again, to live, to function. It was a good 
job, it had its rewards and we did it as 
well as anyone." 

The attempt to save life and limb 
placed great demands upon the physicians of the Third MASH (Mobile Army 
Surgical Hospital). Operating sessions of 
12 and 14 hours were commonplace, though Keggi remembers 
one session which lasted over 30. At 
times of fewer casualties, the tedium of 
MASH life increased. Keggi and his 
tent-mates sometimes 
resorted to 
Hawkeye Pierce-type feats to relieve the 
boredom. Recalling his theft of a convoy of Navy goods, Keggi smiles wryly 
and explains, "On R&R in Bangkok, I 
met a Navy lieutenant who was number

three in charge of the port of Saigon. I 
told him stories about our lack of 
penicillin and refrigeration, and he said 
we could get whatever we wanted at the 
Saigon Navy warehouses. Later, I filled 
out a stack of requisitions and went to 
Saigon. Well, the Army had sent a new 
colonel to be in charge of the port. We 
needed him to countersign the forms, 
but when we went to his office, he blew 
his stack. He signed only one of our 
1000 or so requisitions. So after we left 
his office, the lieutenant and I went to 
the Saigon PX and got some Army second lieutenant to countersign all the 
other forms. Pretty soon, we had the 
best outfitted MASH in Vietnam." 

Pranks like these helped Keggi cope 
with the tedium and strain. On a 
broader scale, Washington's handling of 
the war constantly frustrated and 
angered him. Keggi feels the fighting 
would have ended in six months had 
America properly utilized its great 
military superiority. "Fifty thousand 
deaths would have been avoided if we 
had fought the war the way it should've 
been fought: if we had been allowed to 
go after the North Vietnamese into 
Cambodia, if we would've bombed 
Hanoi and Haiphong and all the other 
places from where they were running 
arms into the south in 1965-66. The only time we bombed Hanoi like we 
bombed Europe in World War II was 
during Christmas of 1972. Soon after 
that, we were talking peace. It was the 
first time in the entire war when we 
fought realistically." 

While in Vietnam, Keggi learned 
that the national sentiment toward the 
war differed greatly from his own. 
Yale's anti-war position particularly annoyed him, and he was infuriated by 
faculty member Staughton Lynd's role 
in the peace movement. Lynd, an assistant professor of history from 1964 to 
1968, visited Hanoi during the winter 
of 1965-66. Keggi believes Lynd's actions indicated support of the North 
Vietnamese communist regime. Moreover, Lynd's trip proved to Keggi that 
civilians knew very little about the Vietnam situation. "People can do whatever 
they want in our democratic society," 
says Keggi. "But Lynd went to Vietnam 
when we had POWs there and was actively supporting the enemy. Our 
POWs were being tortured and shot, 
and some idiot from Yale went over 
there and came back with glorious 
reports saying that they were being 
treated well. Under normal circumstances of war, that's called treason." 

Despite his disagreement with Yale's 
anti-war stand,

Keggi began
