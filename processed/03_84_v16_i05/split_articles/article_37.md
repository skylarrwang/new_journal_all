"Well, you see, we saw .. : that nigger on the street, 
okay? And he, well he ... " 
"Mr. Buddy bought it for us," said Kate, "but he really 
isn't to blame." 
"Who's Buddy?" asked the cop, already fascinated with 
the registration of our car. "I've heard that name before." 
That was enough for Kate, who thought she'd found a fel-
low fan and told him everything. 

Hour after hour we sat in the Fulton County jail tank, 
decked in all our finery and whiteness, while· police captains 
and state officials overrode one another's authority and the 
bail went up, then down, then up again. Our arresting of-
ficers "forgot to appear" at the subsequent trial and we were 
freed without any of it getting into the papers. 

There is life after arrest. Before this debacle, in fact, on 
the day Lester Maddox was elected, I'd discovered Ann 
Darling (that's really her name) who wrote for UPI, was 
beautiful, wore a pink miniskirt and zipped around Atlanta 
on a motorcycle. 

I had our future together all worked out, though she 
didn't know it yet. First, I'd steel her tender woman's heart 
to ruthless practice. Together then we'd roam the South, 
unmasking villains no matter what the danger, escaping on 
her Honda 50 into the soft Southern night. Annie pitied me 
my night in jail and took me out to supper. 

Her bureau chief joined us. They gave me all the week's 
gossip, wonderful inside stories that make you wish you 
had one just as good. I asked him how he stayed so relaxed 
that nothing ever seemed to surprise him. Alcohol helped, 
he said, and he bought me drinks. 

The room became a dancer, life on earth was fine, I am 
in love with Ann. Maybe she loves me too. She acts like she 
does. She asks lots of questions, especially about my night 
in the Governor's car. Yale was never like this. I traded in 
my story for her vows of secrecy, and we three friends 
laughted till the tables shook. 

Ann Darling's expose, citing me-of-Yale as the source, 
appeared two days later on the front pages of both Atlanta 
newspapers. I hid out, eating Rolaids. Maddox fired Bud-
dy and the girls; Buddy was sure I had set him up, for fun. 
Ann and her chief turned out to be lovers. Spring vacation 
was over. 

The Deep North was a lot less inspiring than the Deep 
South. Articles about the squalor of black New Haven, the 
• uphill fight of community organizers against the City and 
against Yale, aroused zero interest. Wasn't helping New 
H aven's underclass a challenge and an obligation? But Yale 
reasonably saw its job as investing in those most likely to 
pay !t back with interest, i.e., us. 

Meanwhile, five courses. '"A dominant of the dominant starts, 
bar thirty-two, and the dominant of the dominant that closes bar 
fortyjive leads into the dominant and theme 'B'. "'I was beaten un-
conscious in the slums one night by six black guys, 
strangers who did it for fun. "The work of Francesco Raiboldini 
may be characterized by the representation of finely-molded and 
delicate things that do not transcend, as it were, their separateness 
from surrounding objects . .. "On the back of an envelope: "E, 
Sarah Lawrence Fri: train to Bxvl, uphill rd to lst dirt path 
on left, hole in fence. After 11." 

By indirection we were learning how to bluff, bullshit, 
and sneak by. This was arguably an important discipline 
for later life, but the glowing transcript meant nothing 
more. (Trapped in a crucial Poli-Sci final valued one-third 
on a book I hadn't read, a survey of political philosophies of 
emerging Africa's leaders t"Be specific! Name names!"] I 
closed my eyes and tried to imagine the boss. H ere he is, 
emerging from a limousine. He smokes filter-tip cigarettes 
through a holder and has nostalgic memories for his days at 
Yale or Harvard or Cambridge. At one of those places, he's 
read the same books I've been reading. I invented three ar-
.chetypes, including a Poet of the Future, and by the time I 
got to the names and specifics, I had so much to say that the 
pen could not keep up! I was generous with those names and 
places, every single one illegible. For this I received a 
perfect score and the second highest final grade in the class 
of 300.) 

In 1967 a crew of radicals captured the US Student Press 
Association (which grouped hundreds of college papers 
throughout the country) and planned to use it on the cut-
ting edge of World Revolution. They'd invited me to edit a 
student magazine, to be financed by diverting the Associa-
tion's savings and its grants, that would begin with a cir-
culation of one million. The chief wanted me to drop out of 
school for this. H e argued that we were living in the era of 
America's Third Reich. The future wouldjudge us as jews 
judged Germans. The times did feel that bad, and my 
generation's sometimes morbid preoccupation with its im-
age linked us to our parents' obsession w;th propriety. 

The radicals were deposed in a bizarre coup at the 
Association's national convention, and in the course o( an 
unsuccessful effort to patch this up, I got myself elected 
Chairman. The deposed founded their own "Liberation 
News Service (LNS)," lived on the edge, danced with the 
Vietcong, and expanded their imaginations with fantastic 
quantities of dope. 

A role in the apocalypse stayed open. Why, for example, 
didn't I invite Robert McNamara to address our mid-year 
convention? LNS and its far-flung allies would take care of 
the rest: a burst of smoke would obscure the Defense 
What did we do in the Templum? We pon-
tiffs put on our red pontifical robes, sat on 
benches and read each other essays!

Secretary mid-speech, the curtains behind him part, and 
there would be The Beatles, who'd start to play! This would 
signal the start of peasant uprisings around the world and 
in every American ghetto. 

"But McNamara will have guards," I said. "Don't you 
think they could panic and shoot The Beatles?" If this was a 
convincing objection for my friends at LNS, there were 
others who saw only the potential ("GOVERNMENT 
SLAUGHTERS BEATLES!" "FIFTY MILLION TAKE 
TO STREETS!") 

My LNS pals heard even weirder schemes. "Jerry Rubin 
called today," Ray Mungo told me, "very excited with a 
new idea. He wants to organize book burnings at every col-
lege in the country and he wants us to help him do it." 
"Any books in particular?" 
"Doesn't matter, all of them. There's something there 
and I told him I appreciated the idea, but there was a con-
notation ... well, I just told him it might be misinter-
preted." 

Logic, committees, professionalism, books, what was the 
use of any of it? Madness ruled the world. There was an 
element of envy in my horror at LNS's proclivity for stories 
that were "truer than true," or which "ought to be true," 
news stories, in other words, that their writers had invented 
from scratch. 

To be as free and ruthless as our government, to fight 
fire with fire: hadn't the President himself wrecked the 
worth of fair practice and restraint? Every sensible, logical, 
moderate path seemed a trap in his game of dirty pool. If 
Sir Thomas More himself had come back from the dead to 
preach the rule of law in 1967, he might well have been 
written ofT as an agent for LBJ. 

Beth Callaghan/The Naw Journal 
Yet to take up the rock, or the joint, or revolutionary 
disciplines to escape the dustbin of history, was to land 
squarely in the junkyard of contemporary politics. 

There was a romance to that alien and helpless feeling, 
the romance of a link to hounded bands in history-
Rome's enslaved Greeks, perhaps, or the Jews of Ren-
aissance England or of Russia, or Victoria's homosexuals, 
huddled in secret smokey rooms, alone in their time to see 
the whole world upside down. The guy in the bar knows 
what he knows, and so did we. Issues were decided by the 
inner eye; none of us with all our reading could know much 
about Vietnam, and going there to learn the truth just 
warped you worse. My certainties all came from one week 
in Alabama three years before. 

Though we were by nature troublemakers who wouldn't 
have lasted three minutes in Russia, few of us dreamed of 
getting down on Russians or other types of adversaries. 
Vocal anti-Communists were almost without exception 
America's own worst types. Sex-obsessed Bible-thumpers, 
virulent racists, war-lovers, they were the dregs of geo-
politics and religion. In their contempt for the exercise of 
liberty, love of regimentation, consuming paranoia, they 
closely resembled the foe they professionally opposed. 

Above all, they stood for "no fun." The anti-war movement 
willingly surrendered to them flag and patriotic turf. 

My generation, for all its alienation, lacked political 
culture. We were spoiled, used to getting our way. We ex-
pected fast action on our complaints. We Jacked the pa-
tience and the discipline and the generosity to do real work. 
slow, steady, compromised and undramatic. What was the 
real work, anyway? 

The Vietcong would continue to kill our fellows; thar"s

how they vott·d on their future. Many of the war's op-
ponents would continue to bait or confuse this country's 
votet·s in the name of peace. of "bringing home the war," 
(bombings, stret·t fighting,) of creating the New Order, etc. 
All of this would melt into air· when the draft ended, and for 
ye<us thereafter almost everyone on every side would pre-
tend that none of it had ever happened. 

We had some cflect. Led by events, limited by who we 
were, we were hardly her·oes. But we dreamed heroic 
dreams. 

Today's nuclear war and peace debate is much harder. 
We're in a mortal fix because of the too-smart-for-our-own-
good animals we've become. It's obvious the species has to 
g<'t more than a little like Jesus to save itself, and it's even 
more obvious that it won't. Can we be forced, like the 
South was forced by .Johnson's dvil right~ laws? Can we be 
trit·kt·d? 

Neophytc nostalgia-buffs: a dr·awn-out invasion of Cen-
tral Am.crica, fueled by a universal draft, will give you the 
sixties experience in person. Then you can call it the 
eighties. Central Amer·ica may not interest everyone, but 
few of us were interested in Vietnam either. It's amazing 
how quickly interest can pick up given the danger of being 
for<·ed to fight in a hot, wet, distant country on the wrong 
side against passionate .locals. 

Back at the ranch 
What lurked inside the engine, in this hurricane's eye? I 
joined a spook. I don't remember what my doom was to 
have been for telling, but in the spirit of those fabulous six-
ties r invite you in to my Secret Society: 

Scroll and Key still occupies its own prominent corner in 
back of Woodbridge Hall, a leafy spot so still and dead f'd 
walked by it daily for three years without ever realizing it 
was there. Through it had passed leading war hawks, the 
then-Mayor of New York and his predecessor, even Dr. 
Spack. "Keys" was said by its proponents to be "as impor-
tant" as Skull and Bones and "the best intellectual ex-
perience around," to boot. 

We initiates entered a world of schoolboy secrets, com-
plete with printed notices that said "DESTROY!" We were 
given keys to the immense outer double-doors of steel and 
the combination to the unseen vault just past it. Three 
levels of Tomb, a library and living rooms with green 
leather couches, an eternally-stocked fridge and freezer in 
the huge basement kitchen, absolute unbotherability and 
the valet services of a Negro servant whom we had to ad-
dress as Wamba; all this was ours. A safe ;n the library con-
tained bound volumes of essays handwritten by earlier 
~cnerations. Behind their latinate mumbo jumbo was the 
unmistakable tone of adolescent girls weeping away the last 
. week of summer camp, mixed with that local combination 
of great expectations and pretension. 

'1/1/e were known generically to one another as pontiffs, 
and '"·e had to assemble twice-weekly in the cavernous

basement to feast. On one of those days we gathered after-
ward in the top noor Templum, a wood-panelled vault-
within-the-vault, sealed off from Wamba and the inner-
outside bv a heavy wooden door and brass lock. 

What did we do in the Templum? I wish I could confess to 
non-stop nights with pretty slave-girls bathing us in oil and 
cheerfully performing exotic pleasure rites we'd never have 
dared to ask of our girlfriends. Instead we pontiffs put on 
our red pontifical robes and, addressing one another by the 
secret names passed down pontiff-to-pontiff for one hun-
dred twenty-five years, sat on benches and read each other 
essays! 

No wonder the tomb had no windows; it was a monu-
ment to human frailty . We pontiffs were young and 
healthy. which in itself certified us in those youth-
worshipping years as the crown of creation. We lived on the 
planet's richest and freest surfac<.~. protected by vigilant ar-
mies tnat kept the world in fear. We were part of one of this 
America's great t'lite institutions. And yet-or perhaps 
because of all this-in order to feel safe, to relax with one 
another, to confess our fears and ambitions, we were 
assumed to need all this as well. 

I was the worst pontiff Scroll and Key ev~r bad. I snuck 
in girls, I skipped the meetings, lost my pin, forgot the 
secret words for the sacred initials. complained about call-
ing Wamba, Wamba and finally quit. When T was in town 
- and I had to be away a lot- I tried to focus on my fellow 
pontiffs in the Templum, God knows I tried, but that 
hallucination of a setting just defeated me. I set upon the 
others and myself Chekhov's cold and gentle laughter, 
Gogo! wild with wicked glee. 

Home work 
Talk your way into Scholar of the House and you get a year 
free from everything, in r·cturn for handing in something 
big at the end. I proposed a history of Rockbridge County, 
Virginia, from the Great Slavery Debate of 1832 to the 
denouement of Reconstruction less than fifty years later. It 
weighed in (late) at 150,000 typewritten words. 

My cast included two locals who became Virginia 
Governors. Stonewall Jackson, even Robert E. Lee, who 
lived out his post-war years running Washington College, 
but most of my lives were obscure. Thousands of pages of 
letters, diaries, ledgers, and newspapers were miraculously 
preserved in archives at Yale, Washington, D.C., Rich-
mond, Charlottesville, Lexington (Virginia) and Madison, 
Wisconsin. It was a giant jigsaw puzzle and I worked in 
hopes that accumulated elements would start to glow and 
tell me everything. v\'e lived with Vietnam but they lived 
with slavery. How?
