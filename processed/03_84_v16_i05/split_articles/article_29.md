chemical campaign that was given the 
code name Operation Ranch H anel. 
"We were engaged in the;: largest 
opt·ration of its kind in hisrory," said 
Galsron. "It has bc.Tn !{ivc.·n the name of 
't•cocicfto .' We sprayc.·d many tons of 
various kinds of dwmicals ove•· 5 
million acres, whit·h is a mnsidt·rable 
piece of real estate, almost the size of 
Massachusetts. And in so doing, ·we• not 
only caused vast devastation to the 
mangroves and the upland fclrests. and 
to a certain extent to cultivated lands. 
but we also caused va<;t devastation to 
the wildlife, and possiblv to man as 
well." 

Today, many scientists in Vit•tnam 
and the US are convmced that Agent 
Orange has caused substantial long-
term damage to human ht•alth in 
Southeast Asia, most notably in the· 
form of congenital birth defects and a 
high rate of miscarriages among Viet-
namese women. Also, some 60.000 
Vietnam veterans at 
VA hospitals 
around the US have complained of 
medical 
problems - ranging 
from 
respiratory ailments 10 skin cann-r to 
sterility-which they daim resulted 
from exposure to Agt•nt Oranl{<'. The 
war veterans in .January of f979 filed a 
class action suit in a Feckral Distriu 
Coun on Lon!{ Island again<;t tht· 
government and the 
Do"~ Chemical 
Company (the major manufanurer of 
Agent Orange durin!{ the· "'ar). "Do\' 
officials knew of the· harmful com-
ponents of Agent Oranl.{e' bat k in tlw 
fifties," said Galsron, "and it'" on that 
basis that the vt·terans han· indudt•d 
Dow in the J;m.,uir. Bt•ntu.,t• if thn 
knew about the harmful compom·nt·, 
and did not tell tht• governnwnt. "h1c h 
was solidting 1he rnanuf~ll turin'{ of it. 
then Dnw is equally c.ulp.tbk." 

Arthur Galston. the 64-yc.:ar·-olcl Eaton 
Professor of Botany at Yale feels partly 
responsible for the whole amtir. "Unwit-
tingly, in m y attempt 10 solve a bask 
p•·oblcm," Galston later cold the 
Yal~ 
Daily New'S, "I had spawned a destruc-
tive weapon." He latc..·r wrote: "Evt•n the 
botanist, one of the last of the scientific 
innocents, can be..· involved in problt-ms 
permeating every aspc..·<·t of s<x·ic..·t y. 
M any scientists arc nm' comin~ to f~·d 
that they cannot su1-rc..·nckr control of 
their findings w busine'lsme·n. politi-
cians or others for indisniminatc..· and 
unregulated use in so<:ial or military 
contexts." 

Galston's conscicn<·c prompted him 
to study the cfTects of Al{ent Oranl{c.· in 
tht· rice fields and manl{rm·t•s of Vit·t-
nam. He has travdkd there on fiv1• dif-
ferent occasions sinn· 1971 t<l studv tlw 
environmental impact of the..· <It-foliation 
campaign. "It seemed to nw that it 
wasn't right to usc my education 
- \•.'hich after all the public had gi\'1'11 
me-w find snmethi ng whkh could lx· 
socially detrimental and tlwn just wa~h 
my hands of it and walk away. r didn't 
think that was an cthic·al way 
to 
behave." 

Galston is a short, pleasant man 
whose hair is now silvery gray. In his 
office on the ninth floor of Kline 
Biology Tower he keeps a small sample 
bottle of a Dow product marked, 
simply, ~oRANGE." On the walls are 
photographs of Galston posing with 
Asian leaders, among them, Chou En-
Lai of the People's Republic of China. 
Galston. in fact, was the first Amerl<:an 
scientist to go to Red China. back in 
1971. He has a way of making his 
listeners forget how unusual his life's 
work has been. He can make the most 
dramatic episodes in his life seem rather 
commonplace, like the time he was 
interviewed by the State Depanment as 
a "'China expert,"' after having spent 17 
pre<·inus days on the main land. O r the· 
time he testified in a Congressional 
hearing on defoliation in Vietnam. Just 
a week ago he was in Cuba on a scien-
tific tour. Yet he always seems to come 
across as the same unassuming botanist 
who could spend a year working with 
soybeans back in Illinois. 

Galston played an indispensible role 
in denouncing Operation R anch H and. 
"By 1966 I was convinced that there was 
something to worry about, so I was now 
taking a ~il.{orous anti-herbicide spray-
ing point of view. In the name of the 
American people, we wert' spraying 
chemicals bver Vietnam that were kill-
ing plants, ruining the ecology, altering 
things. I started asking my colleagues, 
'Is that what we as American people 
ought to be doing over there?' I mean, 
the whol<.- Vietnam busine ., was so 
complicau·d anyho~' ." 

First, there was the que<>tion of 
whether we w<.-re violating the Geneva 
Gas Protocol of 1925 which outlawed 
chemical and biological warfare. The 
United State'! had never actually signed 
that document, but it had approved a 
UN Resolu tion which banned the us,.. 
of "asphvxiatin~. poisonous or other 
ga.;es., or •analt'X{ous liquids, materials, 
or devices" in war. Galston was not 
prepared to say whether the Americans 
were violating the letter of the Resolu-
tion ("that is a lawyer's question," he 
said) but he was fairly certain they were 
violating ItS spirit. Not "only was the 
United States using herbicide , Galston 
learned, but also millions of pounds of a 
"riot control" gas known as CS to flush 
out caves and structures occupied by 
the Vi<.'t Cong. 

Ev<.-n more troubling to Galston was 
the fact that the milital")· spraying 
operation was affecting civilian popula-
tion.;. Tht•n· wa~ im n'asin\{ t''- idcnc-t'

Froru early on II lx·ntrnt• ap-
pan:nt that the I{OVt'rnment was covt'r-
ing somethin~ up. "The American and 
South V1etnamese authorities in Saigon 
were hmdering our attempts to figure 
out "hat wac; 
~oing on Clearly we 
"'ert'n't getting the facts about the ex-
tent of the d<.-foliation. Until we staned


to scream abbut it, the whole operation 
was kept secret. Operation Ranch 
Hand was carried out with great scien-
tific rigor. The planes sprayed in forma-
tions, and the dosages were all very 
clearly worked out." 

At a meeting of the influential 
American Society of Plant Physiologists 
in 1966, Galston suggested sending an 
official letter to President Lyndon 
Johnson protesting the spraying of 
Agent Orange. The Society's executive 
committee voted down Galston's pro-
posal. (Galston later discovered that the 
executive committee's chairman had 
held a research contract on defoliants 
from Fort Detr·ick laboratories.) So as a 
substitute, Galston and a dozen of his 
colleagues sent Johnson a letter of their 
own:

J ohnson's response came in the form of 
a letter from Undersecretary of State 
Dixon Donnelly, dated September 28, 
1966:

This admission made Galston and his 
colleagues all the more concerned. They 
continued to pressure the government 
until 1969, when Galston met with
