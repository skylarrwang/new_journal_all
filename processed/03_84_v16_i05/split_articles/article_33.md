of his argument fell heavy upon me, 
though I 
wondered academically 
whether continuing smoking and then 
getting zapped was winning or losing 
under his macabre odds. I didn't ask, 
but I stopped thinking about quitting 
for the time being. Sometimes the long 
run is no later than tomorrow. 
Now 
the 
probability of getting 
zapped was slim, indeed. The odds 
seemed tipped. Now there probably was 
a long run worth considering. I pulled 
long on my cigarette in contemplation 
of the new calculus and inhaled deep. I 
tossed the cigarette into a pile of snow 
near the doorway to the party and 
entered. 

A 
conversational clatter ' 
greeted me from the large, slightly 
unkempt living room. A thin, tiny 
phonograph played softly. Knots of 
11 
people talked about law and other ap-
propriate topics. 

In 
one corner, 
somebody was defending Charlie 
Reich. I didn't recognize many of the 
people or the notions they expounded. 
One of the two people I had known 
from two years before asked if I was out 
of the army for good. I told them it was 
hard to tell- if I had learned anything 
in two years, it was that the future is 
equivocal. Another guy asked if my 
ideas about the war had changed. I said 
I wasn't sure my ideas were changed in 
direction, just 
in substance. Ti¥tt 
seemed to make sense to him, though I 
don't know why. Then a girl came 
toward me through the lagging conver-
sation to introduce herself. 

She was small, with long black hair' 
She wore a sweater, pants and long 
boots. I vaguely recognized her from 
my first stay at Yale, and she said she 
vaguely recognized me. She was attrac-
tive and assertive at once, talking to me 
as easily as a man to a man. That was 
good, but I wondered what a horror it 
must be to the grunts (light weapons in-
fantrymen) when they return and meet 
their first 
liberated woman. The 
political consciousness on the issue of 
women's lib is about as low in the infan-
try as it is in a professional hockey 
team's locker room. The only chauvin-
ism a grunt has in combat is male 
<·hauvinism. Sex deprivation and the 
extreme tension of the fight carry the 
grunts' sexist orations beyond mere hor-
niness. 

"When I get back across the pond 
there better not be no woman waiting 
there in pants." 

"There it is." 

"No woman's gonna be talking shit to 
me. They're just gonna be fucking." 

"Roger that." 

" "Yeah, but it's OK what they say 
about going without l:kas. I'm for that." 

"That's a rog." 

I imagined the sc4me of one of those 
surly one-year killerS trying to make a 
pass at a feminist at the San Francisco 
airport on. the way home, and I laughed 
out loud. Despite their virile liturgies, I 
supposed, the grunts learned to live 
with American women eventually, just 
as they had learned to live with com-
bat-as a matter of survival. 

The girl asked me if I had seen any 
fighting. I said yes and half smiled. I 
didn't know why I had smiled. Maybe I 
was amused at the idea of how she 
would ask the question that probably 
·bothered her a little-whether I had 
killed anyone. She never asked. Or 
maybe I smiled at the very unlikelihood 
of a chain of events that had forced me 
to answer that, yes, I had been in com-
bat. Whatever, I didn't like my half-
smile. It was depraved. "Shit," was all 
she said in awe or condemnation. The 
silence between us was filled by the folk 
rock background music. 

"They invaded Laos today," she final-
ly said. 

"The Americans?" I asked. 

"Advisors, I guess, and some planes 
and shit." 

"Christ." 

My memory wrenched me back to 
the Cambodian invasion, back through 
all the terror of that first trip across the 
border into areas the North Vietnamese 
Army had held for so many years, 
through despair at the death and cap-
ture of colleagues trying to report the 
new war and through the awe at the 
destructive power of American forces 
on the move. For some moments there 
was no more smoky living room at 
Yale, no more folk rock. J ust vignettes 
of armor columns gnashing up quiet 
Cambodian roads, of the town of Snuol 
destroyed by American tanks and jets, 
of the little children's bodies laid out in 
what was left of the town square, of an 
American grunt on a reconna~~sance 
assault poking his head up from a little 
clump of weeds where he had run for 
cover and saying, "Jesus this is a 
beautiful 
place. 
We're going 
to 
fuck ... it ... up." 

"It's too cold out for the kind of 
demonstrations they had after the Cam-
bodian thing," she said, snapping me 
back to the living room. I halt excused 
myself and walked away. I realized I 
had been impolite, but I couldn't talk 
about the war in moral terms. It was 
easy to discuss in political and economic 
terms. 

I 
had 
thought 
out those 
arguments at length, but whatever 
moral arguments there were always 
stayed just below the surface, inar-
ticulate and maybe even metaphysical, 
yet shaping every phrase. I couldn't 
recite them. Now I was back into the 
most visceral of memories, and I didn't 
have the fortitude to explain them. How 
could I make someone understand the 
difference between morality and what 
happens to a man's soul when he leaps 
out of a helicopter on a combat assault?

How could I relate ethics to the smell of 
carnage and cordite? That would take a 
novel to do, and maybe it was even im-
possible to do in a novel this late in the 
day. I certainly had nothing prepared 
for conversation this late in the evening, 
. so I accepted the burden of being im-
polite and left the party. 

The Sunday Times at the 'newsstand 
carried nothing of the invasion. A brief 
report on the radio indicated that the 
girl was wrong about American ad-
visors, but that didn't change the feeling 
deep in my gut. It was too cold out for 
the kind of demonstrations they had 
after the Cambodian thing. One more 
tight knot in the intestines. I put a 
record on the phonograph and lit a 
cigarette. 

I didn't hear the song first at Yale, 
but that night I heard it best: a song by 
Joni 
Mitchell called 
Woodstock, 
a 
beautiful song. Its harmonies are at 
once disconcerting and enchanting, and 
the melody is one of her best. But when 
the lyrics reached the final stanza, I was 
jarred: 

By the time we got to Woodstock 
We were half a million strong 
And everywhere there was song and 
celebration 
And I dreamed I saw the bombers 
Riding shotgun in the sky 
And they were turning into butterflies 
Above our nation. 

We are stardust 
We are golden 
And we've .t:ot to get ourselves 
Back to the garden 

Bombers into butterOies. There it was. 
The nitch, the inevitable Oaw in the 
rapturous schemes I had been hearing 
so much about and feeling so uneasy 
about since returning to Yale. Con-
sciousness III. The other kind of 
Journey to the East. Shaping a new na-
tion: an imagination. Maybe it was 
merely a matter of my own limitations, 
but even imagination recoiled at the 
thought of turning bombers into but-
ternies by a quick stroke of the mind. 
When a bomber does its job, there is no 
mistaking what the job is. The ground 
shakes as if the world were suffering a 
seizure. The air is filled with fire and 
smoke·and a roar so profound that the 
whole earth is its sounding board. If ' 
you are a few kilometers from where a 
B52 strike comes raining down, it is an 
earthquake. Any closer and it is prob-
ably death. When there are survivors of 
the bombings, they are dazed, bleeding 
at every orifice from the concussion, 
deaf, and nearly insane with fear. The 
bombers that truly ride shotgun in the 
. sky do nothing but kill. They are no 
kind of butterfly. They are products of 
another imagination than that fired by 
the Woodstock experience, an imagina-
tion far less shifting as the foundation 
for a nation, an imagination as old as 
man- the imaginatiotr of Power. I told 
an old college friend about all this once 
and he branded me too literal. I told an 
ex-grunt, anti-war activist about it and 
he nodded and said, "No amount of 
grass or fantasy will turn a machinegun 
into a vase for flowers." 

I wanted to believe those lyrics, sit· 
ting in my solemn room the night of the 
Laotian invasion, but I simply could 
not. The 
sentiment -like the sen· 
timents turning and churning in the 
counter culture movement - was pret· 
ty. It worked only if the bombers were 
in the imagination as well as the but· 
terOies, if everything for a time were a 
pipe dream. J ust as counterculture 
probably works for any one individual. 
There is an ugly catch, though. Despite 
absolute idealism. people die under 


bombers. And despite the raised con-
sciousness of one man, a fact remains: 
power fills the vacuum left by the 
abrogation of power. In other words, 
there is always someone waiting to do 
despicable things if no one is there to 
stop him. 

Something deeper than just the 
fatuity 
of the 
lyrics distressed me. 
After all, it was a pleasant sort of inani-
ty. And weren't civilization's geniuses 
and augurs often a little ingenuous? 
What nagged at me that night was not a 
condescending disgust at a set of easy 
answers chanted in the cloister. I felt no 
disgust or condescension at all. In the 
bowels of all this there was something 
that brought Yale with its soirees and 
carillons and broad greens in tight with 
the Indochina war. A diabolical connec-
' "' 
tion linked them together like two 
prisoners in transit. No, I thought as I 
smoked a final cigarette before trying to 
sleep, this is not condescension or 
disgust. This. is dread. 

T he Vietnam Witness promised to be 
all about Laos. It promised, in addition, 
a clue to where it was I had returned. 
Averell Harriman and Cyrus Vance, 
the Johnson-era negotiators at the Paris 
Peace Talks, spoke early in the evening 
at the Law School. The scenario called 
for short statements by each followed by 
questions from the audience. P redic-
tably, the meeting actually consisted of 
short statements from the statesmen 
and long statements from the audience. 

At Woolsey Hall, the entryways were 
gauntlets of leafletters. The broadsides 
proclaimed everything from a national 
"class action" strike against the war to 
the promulgation of a separate peace 
treaty between right-minded Americans 
and right-minded Vietnamese. 

The hall filled slowly to capacity. 
William Sloane Coffin was to moderate 
the alTair. I wondered whether this 
meeting would be more than just 
another long mea culpa for national sins. 
So unsure was I as to what exactly a 
"witness" entailed that i brought a 
camera and two long lenses to record 
the action. There was no action. T here 
were mea culpas and contumelies against 
the evil, vileness, brutality and im-
morality of the war and its sponsors that 
were all accurate. But some of the 
speakers offered up their invective un-
convincingly, more like cocktail party 
matrons carping about a new painter 
than like tormented souls expressing 
real outrage. Others like Frank Branf-
man, a graduate student who had spent 
time in Laos with the International 
Volunteer Service, almost wept at the 
images of "life under the bombs" he 
dredged up from a troubled memory. 

The audience remained reserved 
throughout; it responded in blocs. A 
speaker dropped a good word for Mao, 
and the scattered Maoists rose to cheer. 
A speaker pleaded for non-violent con-
frontation, 
and 
pacifists 
rose. 
Groups rose like sympathetic chords ad-
ding occasional depth to their favorite 
melodies from the stage. The move-
ment had broken apart since I knew it 
last. Speakers hearkened wistfully back 
to previous rallies, former victories, the 
abdication of LBJ. This time it just 
wasn't the same. Jane H art, wife of the 
Michigan senator and a long-time 
peace activist, hinted at the reason. She 
told the students gathered to bear 
witness that they sltould not let Nixon 
get away with his scheme to undercut 
peace by ending tht" draft and cutting 
US casualities without reducing the ag-
gregate level of violence in Southeast 
Asia or even that violenc<- attributable 
to America. 

There was the crux nf it, that 
demonic link between Yale and the 
southeast Asian war that had eluded me 
for weeks since my return. There was 
the origin of my dread that evening 
listening to a song and remembering an 
invasion. 

America has finally learned how to 
fight its land war in Asia, learned what 
the French never learned, learned that 
the war involves two fronts. The 
American strategy that involved only 
the Asian battlefield was destined to 
defeat by the sophisticated plan of pro-
tracted war, originally developed by 
Mao Tse-Tung against the Japanese. 
The protracted war concept is nothing 
more than a plan built on a recognition 
of the material weakness of the com-
