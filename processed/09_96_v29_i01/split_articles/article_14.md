A
small army of teenage boys has labored on Old Campus for 
the past several days, setting thousands of plastic folding 
chairs along a pattern that would make a civil engineer 
proud. On this Saturday evening, two days before 
Commencement, couples contemplating their last days in New Haven 
and families proud of their graduates-to-be stroll through the perfect 
rows. Like the groups of newly-acquainted freshmen that arrive each 
fall, dumps of graduating seniors linger on Old Campus until well past 
midnight. 

Watching over the scene from a chair on the stage is a security 
guard, silhouetted against the bright lights in the Lanman-Wright 
courtyard. For the first time in as long as the guard can remember, Yale 
has kept a vigilant watch over the preparations for Commencement. 
"I'm not supposed to let kids up here," says the guard working the 4 
p.m. to 12 a.m. shift. "They just wanna sit up here and look out, so 
sometimes I let them-but not now because my boss could be coming 
soon." The guard used to watch the stage from the inside of his car 
parked at the High Street gate, but his boss wants him on the stage 
now. 

The 24-hour guards are just one of several noticeable differences 
this spring. Wrapped in camouflaging green fabric, six setS of speakers 
on 12-foot platforms ring Old Campus. Over the past two days, the 
sound system has been piping in Bob Dylan and other rock classics. 
Locals 34 and 35 have their own sound system. The previous day, 
Bob Proto, president of Local 35, and three union members unloaded 
two huge, yellow speaker lifts into the parking lot of the Center ChurGh 
on the Green. "They're gonna rise up 30 feet high," Proto says proudly. 
"We wanna make sure aiL of our people can hear us," he adds, grinning 
and raisin_g a knowing eyebrow. 

Just before dark on Saturday, Deborah Guber (GRD '96) slowly 
walks her parents down an aisle between the chairs .. All three are 
dressed as if they are going to church. Deborah will receive her 
Ph.D. in political science on Monday. Her parents have come from 
Pennsylvania to be with her. 

More than most Yale parents, Francis Guber and his wife, Dolores 
Linfield, would seem to be the natural allies of Locals 34 and 35. 
Francis is a maintenance man and belongs to a union, while Dolores 
works in a school cafeteria where her union has been fighting an 
attempt to subcontract union jobs. "They want to bring in outside 
companies," she says. Dolores is opposed to subcontracting, which is 
also the largest issue the Yale unions are fighting. "We can do a better 
job than them. We care about the students more than some strangers," 
she says. Dolores and Francis, however, don't know much about the 
contract negotiations between Yale and the unions. "All we know is 
what Deborah tells us and what we read in the newspaper." 

Yet, these parents are dead set against Locals 34 and 35's plan to 
disrupt their daughter's graduation. "It's not so much that we disagree 
with their ideas and ideals, as much as we do with their methods," 
Francis says. "It's wrong. They're just using the students. I've been on 
strike for 13 weeks without benefits or pay, and Jesse Jackson didn't 
come out for us. If it wasn't at Yale and the national media wasn't going 
tO be here, he wouldn't come," he says. "It'd be one thing if they wanted 
to make their view known, but this is not the way," Dolores adds. 

Deborah Guber and her parents aren't alone in their anxiety about 
Commencement. For weeks the unions have widely spread their plans 
to make a ruckus. AFL-CIO organizer Vinny O'Brien suggested 
cancelling Commencement entirely if Yale was worried about too much 
noise. Jesse Jackson told a Boston Glo~ reporter he planned to march

"seven times around Yale campus ... and bring the walls of Jericho 
tumbling down." Yale, anxious to paint the unions as screaming 
radicals, hasn't done much to downplay the hysteria. The Office of 
Public Affairs even reprinted some of O'Brien's most incendiary words 
in full-page newspaper ads. In prominent stories on Commencement in 
the Boston Glob~, the N~ York Tim~s, and the Los Angeles Tim~s, 
student opinion uniformly opposes the unions' Commencement rally. 
But some graduating seniors say the rally might make the otherwise 
boring Commencement exercises a little more memorable. 

Behind the rhetoric, however, Yale administrators are worried about 
being embarrassed in front of the national media, the unions are 
worried that no one will show up at their rally, and students and parents 
are worried Commencement will be ruined. On the Saturday before 
Commencement, everyone is asking, "What's actually going to 
happen?" 

No one knows the answer because any single group's control over 
the situation has long since evaporated. Yale lost control of its own 
Commencement as soon as Locals 34 and 35 decided to have a rally 
across the street. Locals 34 and 35 lost control of their rally when the 
AFL-CIO decided to make it a national priority. The AFL-CIO lost 
control when Jesse Jackson decided to use the rally to promote his 
Rainbow Coalition. New forces supplanted older forces, creating a 
camivalesque tangle of the unexpected. As staffers in the unions' Chapel 
Street office have been saying, "It took on a life of its own." 

grandmother, father, mother, and graduating senior, all of them dressed 
up for the occasion, walk across Elm Street. The grandfather screws his 
face into disapproval and yells from the middle of the street, "Stop 
saying that!" 

"Mr. Levin, I know you want us to act a little nice the next few 
days," the man with the megaphone continues. "Everything's fine on 
the plantation!" 

A young man in a blue oxford shirt walks by. "That's right, can't 
wait to hop on 95," he mutters to his friends. "I can't wait to go back 
home." 

"Watch the swimming pools in the backyardr-HAH!-50 miles 
away from the city!" the man screams. "They wouldn't let this happen 
in their communities!" 

The man with the megaphone is about as close as the Yale families 
will come to confronting the unions on Class Day. On Old Campus 
the only noises are synthesized Latin beats coming from the speakers 
and idle chatter about seating and parking. 

When the Class of '96 enters through the Elm Street gate, parents 
abandon their hard-won seats to get an up-close shot of the graduates. 
Some students smoke cigars, others drink champagne. A few wear 
yellow and blue "Yale Settle" stickers. One wears a Local 34, Local 35, 
and GESO pin with a heavy black line crossed through it. Henry 
Winkler (ORA '70) appears to a cheering crowd, and after dishing out a 
speech full of Democratic platitudes, he tells the Yale graduates, "The 
world is yours! Go and take it!" 


**Class Day at Yale**

By 1 p.m. on Class Day, parents of the Class of 1996 
have claimed their seats on Old Campus to hear Henry 
Winkler's address. At the head of Rose Walk on Elm 
and High Streets, amid swarms of Yale families, a man 
wearing a blue utility jacket and a black eye patch stands, jji!liii~~;11lll~~~~~~ 
screaming through a megaphone. "This is where wt live at, 42 
percent of the city they own," he screams, "and not a dime in 
property taXes!" This statistic is one of his favorites; he's been 
ydling it repeatedly for about 20 minutes. 

Most of the passers-by ignore the man in the utility 
jacket, averting their eyes and temporarily stopping their 
IIIII!~==~ 
conversations. There is no sense in letting a maniac with a .... ~~;! 
megaphone ruin this day. The two Yale cops standing on 
~·~~~iilj~~~ 
either side of Rose Walk look unconcerned as the man 
continues his tirade. As a Yale garbage truck passes by, the 
driver honks the hom in approval

**The "People's Commencement"**
**Page number(s): 18**

Later that evening in Bridgeport, outside 
the Prayer Tabernacle Church of Love, 
parishioners dressed in flashy clothing 
mill 
around 
the 
sidewalk. 
Yale's 
Commencement is far from anyone's mind, 
but the Prayer Tabernacle Church is hosting a 
"Community Rally for Justice and Equality" 
with guests, Reverends Jesse Jackson and AI 
Sharpton. Bridgeport is the first stop on the 
Jackson publicity train. Next stop: New 
Haven and the "People's Commencement." 

Jackson and Sharpton are over an hour 
late; inside the church, the choir is already 
singing. When they finally roll up in a new 
Chevy Crown Victoria, Jackson rides shotgun, 
and Sharpton rides in the back behind the 
driver. Children and church representatives 
crowd around the special guests. 

The pews inside the Bridgeport church 
are crowded. Ushers wearing white dresses and 
gold badges set up folding chairs at the ends 
of the aisles for late-comers. The choir is 
literally rocking. Once inside, it's hard to keep 
still-this music makes you believe. As the 
choir closes its song, the rough, low voice of 
Bishop Ivory Holden asks, "Can you say 
18 
'Praise the Lord'?" and is 
answered by a forceful, 
"Praise the Lord!" As the 
organ starts up again, Holden 
booms, "Sometimes it makes 
your hands go up! Sometim~ 
it makes your feet get light!" 

Moments after a young 
man on the crowded stage 
bursts into tears, Jackson 
enters, followed by Sharpton. 
The band kicks in again, the 
parishioners rise to their feet, 
and 
Jackson 
embraces 
everyone that comes clo.se to 
his open arms. Holden still 
has the microphone. "That's 
Jesse Jackson-give him some love! Give him 
some love!" The church crackles with holy 
electricity as the twO guests take their seats in 
high-backed wooden chairs on the stage. After 
speeches and songs by a number of local, 
honored guests, Sharpton stands up to 
introduce Jackson. "It's one thing to have a 
rally. It's another to have a meeting in a 
church," he says. "Many are leading but few 
are dealing with the spiritual decay. Unless we 
change the values, our children will think 
right is wrong and wrong is right. That's why 
we are going to Yale University, because they 
are practicing greed." The Rainbow Coalition, 
Sharpton says, is like the angel of death 
coming to check for blood above the doors of 
the Israelites. "Are you on the side of 
affirmative action?! Are you on the side of 
Medicare?!" And then he introduces Jackson: 
"My leader, our teacher, our friend, Jesse 
Lewis Jackson!" 

Jesse Jackson rides to the stage on a wave 
of cheers and applause. "I AM!" he says. "I 
AM!" the crowd responds. "SOMEBODY1" 
he says. "SOMEBODY1" they repeat. "STOP 
THE VIOLENCE!" he says. "STOP THE 
VIOLENCE!" they respond. "SAVE THE 
CHILDREN!" he says. "SAVE THE 
CHILDREN!" they respond. This call-and-
response routine cycles through again and 
again until the voices of the packed-in 
parishioners reach a near-impossible volume. 

"We got to go to Yale tomorrow. We got to 
act intelligent, so I thought I'd cut up 
tonight," Jackson says. 

"We're having a great demonstration in 
New Haven tomorrow. An institution with a 
$4 billion endowment can't afford to pay its 
workers. We're gonna walk around the walls 
of Yale until those exploitative leaders come 
tumbling down!" 

Jackson is a reverend, and tonight it 
shows. After every other sentence, people in 
the pews yell out phrases like, "Say it sir!" 
"That's true!" "Amen!" and "That's right!" 
The line between biblical and political is thin. 
Jackson brings the unregistered voters to the 
front of the church and lectures them on the 
virtues of voting. He wraps his politics in 
Bible stories. "We have upon us the building 
of an ark. We put a lot of focus on who can 
swim, but when God spoke to Noah, he said 
even good swimmers could not swim for 40 
days and 40 nights. Those who could swim 
outside the ark drowned. Those who could 
not swim inside the ark survived. As we fight 
these forces we must choose between ark-
building and individual stroking." 

After Jackson finishes his speech, he 
makes a personal appeal for donations: "If you 
are willing to give $100 or more, please 
stand." No one stands up. Jackson repeats his 
plea two more times. Fmally, Bishop Kenneth 
MoaJes, the host pastor, stands, but he is the 
only one. Jackson then says, "Bishop Holden, 
stand up. Sorry to call your name, but we 
need the money." 

Jackson continues, "If you will give at 
least $50, please srand." A few people sWid.
