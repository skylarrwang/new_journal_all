we have a problem with-with no say-
we ... are ... the employers. They are the 
employees. They're telling us what to do. 
It's not supposed to work that way." 
I was able to overlook the dubious 
truth-value of her contention that 
evangelical Christians provide the majority 
of jobs in the state. But it gave me pause to 
hear a leader of a populist movement use a 
rallying cry for class warfare that incites 
the wealthy and powerful to act against the 
less fortunate. Is this what the Coalition 
uses in Alabama? 

Bert Hilberger, former President of the 
Connecticut Tax Law Association and the 
man in charge of the night's presentation 
on abortion, followed Salce. Bert was alone 
that night; he usually co-presents with a 
nurse and an obstetrician. Together, the 
three refer to themselves as the "Truth 
Squad," and they tour around the state 
giving a presentation they call "Abortion: 
Scourge of the Twentieth Century." 

Hilberger's presentation consisted of a 
monologue accompanied by slides and a 
videotape. The question-and-answer 
session that followed began with an 
uncomfortable silence. It was broken when 
one woman told Green that the videotape 
Hilberger showed was too gruesome to be 
seen by children. I smiled to myself. These 
people are clearly a lot less cynical, a lot 
less desensitized, a lot more easily fazed 
than the youth they want to protect. 

An audience member suggested the 
Coalition strive to involve members of 
non-Christian faiths in its effort to 
eliminate abortion. Green used her 
comment to launch into his vision of the 
Christian Coalition's big tent: "Our 
enemies are not people of different faiths. 
Our enemies are people who have no 
faith." Then he looked directly at me for a 
moment, and I ·wondered if that was my 
cue to get up and leave. The look on my 
face must have betrayed my family's proud 
and centuries-old tradition of fervent 
atheism. 

Every momenr of the night had been 
spent preaching to the converted. Though 
SEPTEMBER 6, 199.6 
Green's rhetoric about the Coalition's 
mission was unequivocal, I left the meeting 
unconvinced that anyone has a strong 
sense of what the Coalition is trying to 
accomplish in New Haven. If Green really 
believes that his enemies are New Haveners 
who have no faith, he is going to have a 
city's worth of enemies.

Summer in New Haven is about seeing 
the city differently. After all, the hordes of 
students who daily consume any Yalie's 
line of vision during the academic yea.r are, 
simply, gone. The day after Commencement, a new map of New Haven is drawn 
as the graduating class drives out of the 
city. It's not that familiar streets suddenly 
move to new and unexpected places or that 
restaurants and stores relocate. What I 
sensed was a geography of vision different 
than what I face during the academic year. 

This new geography contours the 
movements of a group that I think goes 
sadly unnoticed during the school year: the 
people who live and work in New Haven 
on a more permanent basis than most 
Yalies. What highlighted these daily 
movements for me was the way I became, 
at least temporarily, part of them. Every 
morning from Monday to Friday, I got up 
at 7:30a.m. and walked to my job at Yale 
University Press. For the first time, I felt 
like I really saw the commuters and 
residents who were, and still are, walking 
and driving and biking to their respective 
jobs-a people's movement veiled by the 
masses of Yalies who take over from late 
August to late May. 

I didn't really live far from campus, 
subletting an apartment in the Oxford 
with what seemed like most of my class in 
Saybrook College. The subtle change in 
vision effected by my stay h·ere this 
summer suggests how porous the walls are 
that segregate New Haven from Yale. The 
university and the city are not totally 
disconnected. Yet while they occupy the 
same urban center, they remain unwed as 
an urban community. It would be a lie for 
me to say that this contradiction was one I 
had never seen before. When I drive 
around New Haven during the school year, 
I have an urge, which I believe is common 
to many New Haven drivers, to run a few 
Yalies down. We, and I am as guilty as the 
next Yalie, assume that cars are made of 
ether in New Haven. Or maybe they're 
simply invisible to us because we allow 
them to go unseen. 

This summer's shift in vision was no 
burst of light and truth: in fact, light and 
truth may have been eclipsed by my 
summer in New Haven.
