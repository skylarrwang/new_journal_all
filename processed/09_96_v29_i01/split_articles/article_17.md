In the Montana wilderness, loggers and environmentalists have 
learned to work together to settle their differences, raising hopes of a 
new approach to managing the nation's forests. 

cuttin' it for our families here in the U. S. of A., we're bringin' in 
wood from goddamn Siberia and Chile. Make me sick." He spat out 
these last words. 

Sitting next to me was Bob Love, an independent logger from 
Columbia Falls and a member of FFP. He looked average-medium 
height and build, medium brown hair with some gray, Levi's and a 
plain t-shirt-but his eyes and voice seemed particularly calm. "When 
it comes right down to it," he said, "our forests have survived pretty 
well without us." He shrugged while Fauth's face turned red and 
quivery. 

"Let's move on," said the moderator at our table, walking 
nervously toward the flip-chart, his hands, legs, and eyeglasses going 
in all different directions. 

A 
month later, the Forest Congress office had consolidated and 
refined the comments from the roundtable into vision 
statements and sent them to the ballroom floor of the 
Sheraton Hotel in Washington, DC. The 1,300 congress participants 
spent four days modifying and voting on these statements of intent. 
The process was part bargain and part bully, part reason and part 
reflex. One table had just taken up principle 33. which states that 
roadless areas of at least 5,000 contiguous acres, including old growth 
forest, should be retained for biological refuge and scientific controls. 
The table was quiet for several minutes, each person considering 
what the others might be thinking. Hidden sounds became loud: 
people adjusting their bodies, licking their lips. Elizabeth Estill, a 
forester for the U.S. Forest Service in Colorado and chair of the table 
for the day, spoke first. "I basically agree with this," she said. 
"Roadless areas are necessary." 

"Yes," replied Herb Winer, a forest consultant and adjunct 
professor at the Yale Forestry School, "but I don't like the idea of a 
broad prescription where decisions need to be made for a specific 
area." 

"We're hounded all the time about protecting old growth," said 
Jerry Duffy, the manager of two biomass-powered electrical plants in 
Georgia, "but most of it's not even natural. Most of it's from fire 
suppression." 

"I think this principle is too specific where it needs to be more 
SEPTEMBER 6, 1996 
vague," pressed Winer. 

"Does this apply to all private and public land?'' asked Billy Jo 
Christy, a mill worker for Stone Consolidated Paper Company in 
Washington. 

"I don't know, but I think it puts too many constraints on 
managers," Duffy said. "I'm not going to give away my keys and 
checkbook with this one." 

There was another silence. "I guess we just don't agree on this," 
said Estill. "But we're running out of time, so let's take a vote." 

Three voted red (against), one green (for). Other tables voted 
similarly, with only 15 percent of the congress supporting the 
principle. 

Voting finished two days later. The participants voted for 12 of 
the 13 vision statements and nearly 17 of the 21 main principles, 
emphasizing sustainable management and the diverse uses of forests. 
Duffy and Christy firmed their friendship with a handshake; Winer 
and Estill traded business cards. Participants at neighboring tables 
sighed in exhaustion; some tossed their hats into the air. A few 
hugged and cried. Everyone applauded. 

This million dollar conference was just vaporous talk, some 
environmentalists complained. Most of the vision statements 
spoke of "sustainability" and "stewardship," but the one 
statement that was not accepted advocated more recycling and the 
efficient use of forest products. The Forest Congress also promoted 
the use of open legislative procedures, but did not speak out against 
the emergency salvage rider, which was rolled onto section 2001(a) of 
a spending recessions bill last fall and has protected qualified timber 
sales from citizen appeals. Steve Kelly, an environmentalist with 
Friends of the Wild Swan, said the thousand-odd citizens should have 
marched to the Capitol and demanded legislative reform, including 
the repeal of the salvage rider. "Consensus," said Kelly, "seems like just 
another word for status quo." 

The Forest Congress was not meant to address specific legislation 
or solve knotty resource problems, Gordon said, but simply to 
develop a vision for the nation's forests. The congress humanized local 
disputes, enabling new coalitions to develop. People who would never 
have been seen together at home shared stories about hobbies and 
families over drinks in the hotel bar. "Specific 
changes in forest management will come 
locally from groups that develop out of the 
congress," Gordon said. Gordon points to 
FFP as a model for the local groups he hopes 
will form. 


FP formed in the winter of 1994 when 
Keith Olson of the Montana Logging 
Association got some friends together 
over coffee. He invited Brent Mitchell of the 
Audubon Society, who said he wanted to 
open dialogue with timber workers; two 
loggers, Floyd Quirum and Jack Jay, who 
told Olson they wanted to get more "diesel 
smoke blowin' and wood chips flyin'" on 
federal land; a community college professor 
active in consensus processes; and a forestry 
professor from the University of Montana. 
"We wanted to sit down and have a talk," 
Olson said, "maybe work some things out." 

The meetings started with democratic 
rules: each participant would speak as an 
individual, not as an organizational 
representative; each would speak honestly 
and politely; the group would work together 
on actions upon which everyone agreed. 

Conversation at the early meetings, Mitchell 
recalled, was charged with the feeling that 
something important was happening. After 
six months, the meetings opened up. 

As many as two dozen community 
members now attend the bimonthly 
meetings and about 80 receive the meeting 
minutes. Still, some environmentalists 
denounce the meetings as "foot rubbing 
sessions with the timber industry," and some 
loggers say they won't put their livelihood on 
the table for "flower-lovin' environmentalists." 

Last year, three members of FFP-Carol 
Daly, a mediator with the Flathead 
Economic Policy Center, Steve Thompson of 
the Montana Wilderness Association, and 
Olson 
of the 
Montana 
Logging 
Association-wrote the Forest Stewardship 
Demonstration Bill to encourage more 
small-scale logging on federal land. The bill 
has been introduced in the U.S. House by 
Rep. Pat Williams (D-MT) and in the 
Senate by Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT). 

Currently, the Forest Service sells trees 
directly to mills, which usually hire the 
lowest-bidding logger to harvest the wood. A 
stewardship contract authorized by the bill 
would allow the Forest Service to choose 
loggers directly, as private land owners do, so 
the agency could select loggers on the basis 
of experience and past performance as well as 
price. 

Once selected, the loggers could make 
their own harvesting decisions, following 
certain guidelines, rather than mechanically 
cutting marked trees. "Giving a skilled logger 
marked trees," Love says, "is like giving an 
artist a paint-by-numbers set." 

Stewardship contracts would be small-
the volume would be limited to 300,000 
board feet (300 MBF), about one-quarter 
the size of an average sale today, and would 
favor small loggers since bidding would be 
restricted to contractors with 25 employees 
or less. There are over a dozen contractors of 
this size in the Flathead region, compared to 
about five mills. Lastly, a citizens' 
stewardship council, drawn from volunteers, 
would meet in open-door sessions with the 
Forest Service to help plan the contracts and 
choose the loggers. "This would be an 
optional program," stresses Daly. "Just 
another tool in the toolbox." 

One afternoon during the Forest 
Congress, Daly, Thompson, Love and I met 
with Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) to try to 
solicit his support for the stewardship bill. 
After we waited half an hour, the senator 
finally greeted us with a big country grin. 
Burns was a radio announcer for crop and 
cattle prices before running for the Senate. 
After six years in office, he still has a voice 
deep enough and gut large enough to make 
him look like a Montanan. We sat down on 
a leather couch with Burns in an oak chair 
across from us. Daly and Thompson talked 
about the rationale of the bill and Love 
discussed some of its practical implications. 
Burns said he was wary of supporting a bill 
sponsored by his Democratic cohorts. 

We walked out of the room tired. 

Someone asked, "So, do you think he'll 
support it?" I don't remember who asked 
because we were all thinking the same 
question. Each of us was afraid to answer it 
out loud. I looked at Love and he just 
shrugged. Months later, Burns called a 
Senate committee hearing on the 
stewardship bill, but he still did not commit 
his full support. 

THE NEW JOURNAL 


Last summer, months after the Flathead 
roundtable and the forest congress, I 
traveled back to the Flathead region. 

Before going to an FFP demonstration 
harvest, which used the stewardship council 
promoted in the legislation, I spent the 
morning with Love. More than anyone, Love 
epitomizes FFP's mix of corporeal workers 
and activists. During the day, he'll install new 
valves on the engine of his bulldozer, then 
over warm dessert with his family at home, 
he'll tell stories of Indian spirits and chakras. 

He and I went out to one of his logging 
jobs and spent the morning chipping tree 
limbs. He chips the cut limbs after 
harvesting, which allows him to cover 
machinery trails and keep nutrients on-site, 
while also meeting state standards for fire 
control. Most loggers pile "slash" and burn it, 
leaving fire scars and exposed sites for weed 
infestation. I stuffed tree limbs into the 400-
pound blade of the drum chipper. It pulled 
the wood in fast and thrust out the chips 
with a sound almost as loud as an airplane 
engine. I wore earplugs, but took them off 
occasionally for the thrill of the noise. 

Meanwhile, Love cleaned up an area near 
the log house. He drop-started his saw to cut 
large pieces of slash into manageable sections 
and directed the 28-inch-long blade 
unconsciously, as if it were a part of his hand. 
Around the big logs he quickly tightened 
choker cables, as if the wood were greased, 
and pulled them to the landing with his 
bulldozer. 

Over lunch he told me stories: his having 
to hike two miles back to his truck after a 
rotten spruce settled back and broke his 
ankle; a fellow sawyer slicing his trigger finger 
down to the bone; another sawyer cutting a 
lodgepole pine which snapped down another 
and another in a quick circle until one 
knocked him dead as he was running off. 

Love has the grit of working almost 20 years 
as a logger. 

Love believes that the best he can do for 
the forest is to leave as much as possible of 
what's already there. He rejects the moral 
relativism that all forestry treatments are 
acceptable as long as they meet the manager's 
objectives. He speaks out against Plum Creek 
Timber Company's clearcutting in the local 
newspaper. 

Love practices what he calls "wild 
forestry." He thinks of trees as a hunter thinks 
of its prey: eliminate cripples in a herd and 
leave strong bucks to reproduce. "Wise 
hunters," he said, "know when to stop 
hunting so the populations stay strong the 
next year." If he's not fully confident he 
should take a tree, Love leaves it standing, 
just as a hunter might let his prey run, even if 
he had it in his sights. 

Under that afternoon, I went to the FFP 
demonstration project on the Flathead 
National Forest. Before it was cut, the 
30-acre stand had dense patches of Douglas fir 
and lodgepole pine, tightly pressed against 
ponderosa pine. Cutting thinned out the fir 
and lodgepole and revealed ponderosa, which 
are so tall and ancient that my pace 
necessarily slowed out of respect when 
walking under them. These ponderosa-
named after the Latin *pond*osus meaning 
"heavy, weighty, significant"-are about 200 
years old, with stout trunks and branches 
thick as muscular arms. In the wind, their 
limbs stand firm, while the boughs of Douglas 
fir jangle as if ornamented. 

After FFP called for volunteers for the 
stewardship council over one year ago, a 
group of about 20 area residents came 
forward. The group directed the harvest from 
the start-choosing the site, selecting the 
harvest treatment after consulting with Forest 
If he's not fully confident 
he should take a tree, 
Love leaves it standing, 
just as a hunter might let 
his prey run, even if he 
had it in his sights. 
Service officials and forestry professors from 
the University of Montana, and monitoring 
the logging practices to make sure they met 
contract specifications. 

About 25 percent of the stand's original 
volume was removed in the harvest. The 
tough western larch and ponderosa pine that 
remained had dominated the stand before fire 
suppression this century. All harvesting was 
done on frozen ground to reduce ground tear; 
some thick patches of fir and lodgepole were 
left where deer and elk bedded; and dead 
standing trees were retained for bird nesting. 
Prescribed understory fires will now be 
introduced to the stand: one section will be 
burned every three to five years, another every 
20, and another not at all, as a control. One 
forester called it a "light-footed, selective 
harvest," another said it "looks like it's been 
done in night slippers."
