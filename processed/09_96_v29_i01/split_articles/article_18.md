"We had good luck with this group," 
said Swan Lake District Ranger Charles 
Harris. "I had final authority, of course, but 
we all basically agreed on things or talked 
them out, so I didn't have to override 
anyone." The process took months longer 
than a conventional sale, where the Forest 
Service decides which stands to harvest and 
which treatments to use, and then seeks 
public comment. But Harris hopes that 
public involvement early on will preclude 
lengthy judicial and administrative appeals. 
He wants to use the stewardship council 
again next year, he said . 

Love was glad to see citizens working 
with the Forest Service in Condon, but was 
disappointed that much of the small yet 
usable timber was discarded into large brush 
. piles for burning. Stewardship contracting is 
needed to get the right person for the job. 
Love, for example, uses the whole animal 
during his harvests, even some of the smallest 
parts-firewood, pulp, posts and poles. 

T
he next day I joined a meeting on 
stewardship contracting sponsored by 
FFP and the Pinchot Institute for 
Conservation, a Washington, DC, forest 
policy organization, in a windowless 
conference room in Kalispell. Some Forest 
Service officials at the meeting argued that 
the current timber bidding system can be 
patched into a stewardship-like package. 
"The solution Lies more in the creative use of 
the current system than in the creation of 
more processes and Laws," said Jeff Sirmon, 
formerly with the Forest Service and now 
working for the Pinchot Institute. 

"We need this bill to change the 
paradigm from getting the logs out to caring 
for the forest," countered Thompson of the 
Montana Wtlderness Association. 

"Look," said Mitchell of the Audubon 
Society, cocking one eye to Forest Service's 
Dave Spores at the front of the room, "We've 
spent a long time coming up with this bill 
and now we need your agency's support to 
get it through." 

Spores had feathered silvery hair and 
wore a green polo shirt, tan slacks and a 
silver watch. I pictured him with his wife 
and family, barbecuing burgers in a trim 
suburban yard. Love wishes there were fewer 
Forest Service employees like him and more 
who were familiar with the land, who 
appreciated a simple meal and shady place to 
rest more than backyard barbecues and 
VCRs. 

"The Forest Service generally doesn't 
support legislation. We just respond to it," 
Spores said to Mitchell. "The Code of 
Federal Regulations is our bible and doing 
things in the best interest of the public is our 
golden rule." 

"Come on," Mitchell tightened up, "our 
community wants these stewardship sales 
and we will give you all the support and 
manpower you need. Just tell us who's in 
charge so we can get this through." 

"It's hard to say," said Spores. "These 
things move up a variety of levels. 
Oftentimes substantial policy viewpoints are 
not shared. But we're trying to be responsive, 
at least at the locallevd." 

I thought of Love, who, earlier in the 
summer, took a group of Forest Service 
officials to a lodgepole pine stand on public 
land that had been attacked by mountain 
pine beetles. The trees were all brambled up, 
the branches of one tree twisted into those of 
another, and the needles were aU brown and 
red, as in an overexposed photo. Here were 
30 acres, with a decent volume of fully dead 
timber needing to be removed so shade-
intolerant seedlings could grow. This was 
one of many small stands Love had seen near 
existing roads and mills and outside of trout 
or bear habitat. But Forest Service officials 
said they were under time pressure and had 
to prioritize large volume salvage sales, even 
if that meant building new roads or cutting 
live trees. 

I saw the irritated and frustrated feelings 
of most FFP members in Mitchell's face: 
pinched-up and angry, then wan and drawn 
down. 

O
n the drive home from the 
stewardship conference, I stopped 
by to see Love and his wife Inez 
once again. Love and I stayed up late that 
night, talking through a full moon in his tall-
windowed dining room. I 
remember 
smelling dirt and diesel on his clothes and 
hearing him say he liked to keep his eyes 
adjusted to the natural light of the sun and 
moon. 

He saw me off early the next morning. 
The grass was thick with dew in the woods 
near his house, so each breath I took felt like 
a drink. Wet air soaked into my mouth, ran 
down my throat. A gray jay scolded us from 
nearby. 

I asked him about FFP. "Will it last?" 
"I don't know," he said simply. "We've 
done our part, so it depends on the Forest 
Service now. None of us can afford ro spend 
another two years on 60 acres of 
demonstration harvests." 

"What are you going co do?" I asked. 
"I'll just keep logging, keep writing 
editorials," he said. "Heck, I'm just starting." 

When I took a few seeps back, the tall 
lodgepole seemed to be surrounding him like 
guardians.
