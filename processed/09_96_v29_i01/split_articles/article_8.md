To the editor: 
I have been a volunteer escort for 
women seeking medical assistance at the 
Summit Women's Center in Bridgeport, 
CT for the past six months. From this 
work I have observed Stanley Scott's 
behavior quite well. And the description 
written by Eva Bonime (TN], April 19, 
1996, "Stanley") gave him more credit 
than he is due. 

"A rapport borderin g on affection 
develops berween Stanley and the escorts." 
To me this is an outrageous observation. 
During the last six months, I have seen 
Stanley use the sign that he always carries 
to shove escorts who were helping women 
avoid his verbal and physical harassment. 
Male escorts and the men who have 
accompanied women into the clinic have 
been no more immune to his wrath than 
the women. I am a 24-year-old male at six 
feet, one inch, weighing 200 pounds, and 
Stanley has shoved me on numerous 
ocassions. Recently, I was shoved rwice by 
Stanley while I was helping a woman get 
out of her car. Stanley's strategy is to run 
up to cars that pull into the parking lot 
and block one of the doors of their car. 
He then yells a repertoire of obscene 
language, demanding to know if they are 
"here to murder your baby!" And while 
doing this he plasters his sign across their 
window. On a different occasion he tried 
to trip me by putting his feet between 
mine while I was escorting a woman to 
the entrance of the clinic. 

Stanley and other anti-choice 
protesters have continually threatened the 
other escorts and me with threats of 
violence, speaking for God, who they say 
will arrive to torture and kill us in many 
different ways, depending on the 
imagination and mood they might be in 
that particular day. On the Saturday of 
May 4, one of the escorts was told she 
would burn in hell while worms 
consumed her body. 

I 
have 
never 
heard 
Stanley 
"compliment the escorts for being 
dedicated, even if their morals are wrong." 
SEPTEMBER 6, 1996 
But I have heard him say to one of the 
older female escorts of our group, at the 
end of a morning after all of the patients 
were helped getting into the clinic, that 
she had one foot in the grave and the 
other sure to follow. 

On the Saturday of May 4, one 
member of the staff of the Summit 
Women's Center was driven to the 
e~trance of the clinic to be dropped off 
by her husband who was driving the car. 
The woman's child, no older than four 
years of age, was also in the car riding in 
the back seat as the staff member got out 
of her vehicle to enter her place of work. 
Stanley approached the car, placed his 
sign on the window, and yelled at the 
child of the worker, "Do you know that 
your mother is a murderer?" 

There is no "buffer zone," as Ms. 
Bonime has written, berween Stanley and 
the escorts or the clinic building. Anti-
choice protesters, including Stanley, shove 
escorts and stand directly in front of the 
clinic entrance every week to intimidate 
the patients and the escorts. At the time 
of this article's appearance in your 
journal, Stanley was arrested on a 
Saturday at the clinic by the Bridgeport 
police on charges of third-degree assault. 
He eventually posted $1,000 for bail and 
was released. On the following Tuesday, 
the next time the clinic was open after 
Saturday, he was back, loud and forceful 
as ever. I do not know the exact number 
of times he has been arrested for assault 
or on other charges related to the clinic, 
but this arrest was definitely not his first. 

Stanley and the other people with 
whom I have contact at the Bridgeport 
clinic need no help in their cause to 
dictate what is correct and the "Truth" 
they say is missing from our lives. Two 
bumper stickers that Ms. Bonime did not 
mention in her article grace Stanley's van 
and the vehicle of one other member of 
their gang: "Pat Buchanan for President" 
and "U.N. out of U.S." 

"Where are the people on the life 
side?" Stanley says in the article. I think 
the people he is looking for are actively 
engaged in many circles at the city, state, 
and federal level.

I was upset by "Stanley" (TN], April 
19, 1996). Surely, with dozens of 
articulate, sensible pro-life activists in the 
Yale community to choose from, Eva 
Bonime could have foun d a better 
representacive. I have found that the great 
majority of the pro-lifers at Yale focus 
their efforts on helping women, not 
harassing them, yet she portrays someone 
at the opposite extreme. At best this is 
sensationalism, but in all probability it's 
stereotyping. We've all seen these 
stereotypes before (pro-life men are 
vioh!nt and incoherent, pro-life women 
are submissive and overly religious), but 
I'm disappointed that a magazine as 
scholarly as The New journal would 
further their use. 

It is understandable why a viewpoint 
which disdains religion and ignores 
science would resort to personal attacks 
to promote its case. It is easier to make 
fun of a 72-year-old man and indirectly 
insult him for being a virgin than it is to 
face the facts. It is not understandable 
why a society which recognizes that 
parasites and bacteria are alive, which 
does not discriminate due to size or 
intelligence, and which realizes that the 
immense changes which take place during 
conception take place at no other time, 
does not value human life before birth.
