I don't want to 
work for The New 
Journal! I have better 
things to do with my 
time than work for a 
magazine that has 
received every major 
writing prize at Yale 
as well as numerous 
awards from the 
Columbia Scholastic 
Press Association. 
Besides, The New 
Journal is just a training 
ground for media types 
like TNJ founder and 
Pulitzer Prize 
winner, Daniel Yergin, 
or past TNJ staffer and 
editor of the 
Chicago Tribune, 
Jack Fuller. And you 
~~r,... think just because The 
' . .., 
New Journal is the 
oldest magazine at 
Yale and also has the 
largest circulation, 
I'm supposed to be 
impressed? Give me 
some credit. So, I beg 
of you, go ask someone 
who cares. 

Well, while we won't be seeing him at any TNJ meetings, we would 
love to see you! The New Journal is looking for innovative writers, DTP demigods, 
cutting-edge designers, dynamic photographers, artistes extraordinaires, business 
tycoons, and interested, interesting Yalies in general. If one of the above 
applies to you, look out for posters for our organizational meetings or 
call The New Journal office at 432-1957.
