Pre-printed Rainbow Coalition envelopes are 
distributed around the church. Along with 
becoming a member for $35, tonight's 
church-goers can also sign up for the Rainbow 
Coalition's own long distance phone service. 
Bishop Moales and the rest of the church 
leaders on the stage begin filling the envelopes 
out. After dramatically sealing and folding his 
envelope, Moales says, "Can we have a few 
baskets here? Just pass your envelopes down to 
the end. We'll give y'all a few 
minutes to finish filling those out. 
You still have time to fill those 
envelopes out." 


It is drizzling on the morning 
of Commencement. According to the schedule, Jackson 
and Sharpton will lead a march of 
community members at 8:30 a.m. 
from the Q-House down Dixwell 
Avenue and Elm Street to the 
New Haven Green. For days, the 
unions have been advertising the 
rally by broadcasting Jackson's 
voice on the radio and driving cars 
through neighborhoods with 
loudspeakers. Behind the scenes, 
Mayor John DeStefano has 
arranged for the unions and Yale to meet 
together and seek a settlement before 
Commencement. Yale's main negotiator, 
Brian Tunney, has met with the unions' main 
negotiator, Michael Boyle (PC '79), several 
times in DeStefano's City Hall office. The two 
sides both say that a settlement is very near. 
Boyle says he wouldn't expect a settlement 
immediately after the rally—it would appear 
that Yale was caving in to strong-arm union 
tactics. But he adds, "I can't see any logical 
reason why it wouldn't be settled by 
September." 


At 8:25 a.m., the sidewalks in front of the 
Q-House are almost empty. The twenty-odd 
people present are almost equally split 
between Student Labor Action Coalition 
(SLAC) members wearing yellow "Yale Settle" 
signs and journalists. The people look a little 
bewildered, waiting for something to happen. 
That's when the socialists roll in, barreling 
onto the scene in small, fuel-efficient imports. 
Jason Coughlin is with the Socialist Workers' 
Campaign from New York City. "We knew 
about this fight for some months," he says. 
"Someone from Boston faxed us a leaflet." 
Armed with banners and literature, the 
socialists are prepared to march. 


Suddenly an 18-wheeler truck, with a red-
hot funk band playing on its flat-bed, 
shimmies and jives through the street. A 
handful of people excitedly crowd around its 
base. Behind the truck is the Crown Victoria 
that Jackson and Sharpton used in Bridgeport. 
As Jackson emerges, people seem to 
materialize around him. Graduating members 
of SLAC, in caps and gowns, shake Jackson's 
hand as they pose for press photographers. 
Jackson thanks the crowd for being there and 
asks them to march behind him in rows of 
five. The hundred people who have now 
gathered slowly begin to walk down Dixwell, 
following Jackson, who is arm-in-arm with 
the Yale graduates. Sharpton follows under a 
large black umbrella. 


While several "Yale Settle" signs dot the 
crowd, an equal number of banners and signs 
support other causes ranging from the 
overthrow of capitalism to nuclear 
disarmament. There is a noticeable 
lack of community members. 


During the march, 
Martha 
Havdendez, of the Socialist 
Campaign, aggressively tries to sell 
the party's newspaper, The Militant, 
to anyone within earshot. Nearby 
walks the Socialist Campaign's own 
presidential candidate, James Harris, 
a meat-packer from Atlanta. 


At York Street another hundred 
people chanting union slogans join 
the march. The crowd parades down 
Elm Street towards the Green and 
past Cross Campus where the 
graduating students are just 
beginning to line up for their own 
procession to Old Campus. 


By 9:15 a.m. the spittle of rain has 
stopped and the sun is out. Along the walk 
from Elm Street to Beinecke Plaza, there are 
signs for every residential college and graduate 
and professional school. Each class will line up 
and march onto Old Campus. Small, round 
"Yale Settle" stickers mix with the traditional 
additions to the mortarboards: flowers and 
leaves for the Forestry School, fleur de lys for 
Ezra Stiles, clocks showing the 13th hour for 
the Drama School. 


Deborah Elkin (GRD '96), who is 
receiving her Ph.D., is trying to convince 
another Ph.D. recipient to smuggle one of the 
large cardboard "Yale Settle" signs into the 
Commencement ceremony to stage a silent 
protest. When this woman declines, Elkin 
pushes her to wear a sticker instead. 


After the graduates fall into their 
marching formation, the band steps through 
Noah Porter Gate. Realizing the march is 
about to begin, relatives and friends of the 
graduates rush out of the gate. The drummers 
begin a drum roll and the band moves 
forward. Two motorcycle cops ride up to 
escort the parade the block and a half to 
Phelps Gate. The unions and Yale have met 
with the New Haven police to orchestrate an 
intricate schedule that prevents union 
supporters and Yale families from coming into 
contact with each other. 


The procession moves slowly onto Elm 
Street. Just before the corner at College Street, 
the rest of the band starts up with a sudden 
burst of noise. Parents crowd onto both sides 
of College Street, looking for their son or 
daughter. As the graduates pass, about 20 
union supporters begin to chant from the 
corner of the Green, "Hey! Ho! Union-
busting has got to go!" Others, behind the 
fence on College Street, simply cheer on the 
graduates. Kathy Cassidy (ES '96), a SLAC 
member, joins in on the union chant. The 
chanting and cheering blend into one noise. 


After some of the graduates have already 
entered Old Campus, the procession stalls, 
and a few graduates step up to the rail to hug 
union members. Reporters grill the graduates 
as they walk past. A reporter pulls Alana 
Conner (SM '96) aside to ask her what she 
thinks of the union rally. She comments, "It 
lends a carnival atmosphere—seriously, that's 
good for somber occasions." A graduating 
senior in Timothy Dwight says, "The protest 
is pretty ridiculous. I think it's quite funny 
that it's not as big as they thought. I guess it 
shows that people have more decency than the 
unions thought." 


As the last of the graduates pass through 
Phelps Gate, friends and relatives crowd in 
behind them. The people press in further; 
tempers flare. "Excuse me!" yells a man in the 
back of the crowd wearing a suit and thick, 
square sunglasses. He cups his hand around 
his mouth. "Can we get into this gate? Does 
anyone know? Do you see anybody moving?" 
His wife, embarrassed by his outburst, pulls 
his arm down, but the man's suspicions are 
correct. No one is being let in through Phelps 
Gate. More upset by this development than 
by the chanting unions, the crowd moves 
down College Street towards Chapel Street, 
where the gates in front of 
Vanderbilt Hall stand wide open. 


Yale put up posters the week 
before, offering students still on 
campus $7.80 per hour to issue 
tickets for Commencement. Each 
ticket is supposed to have the 
guest's name written on it, but as 
people walk through the gates, no 
one is checking for them. 


The speakers pipe in classical 
muzak today, and the events 
beyond the thick stone walls are 
very far away. After the graduates 
have found their seats, Yale Chaplain 
Frederick Streets walks to the podium to 
begin the program. "Welcome to Yale's finest 
hour!" he exclaims. There is a small rumble 
from the union rally, but that is the only noise 
during the program. Dean Richard Brodhead 
(BR '68, GRD '72) requests 
the 
undergraduate degrees. President Richard 
Levin (GRD '74) agrees to give them. 
Graduates in the seats cheer. Commencement 
proceeds as normal. The most conspicuous 
sign of the union protest is a plane circling 
above Old Campus pulling a sign that reads: 
"Save New Haven. Yale Settle." 


When Levin begins his speech at the end 
of the ceremony, about eight graduates march 
to the front of the stage and hold up their 
contraband "Yale Settle" signs. Many people 
do not notice them—the stage level is just 
above the protestors' heads. They calmly and 
quietly leave as soon as Levin is finished. 


On the New Haven Green, a band 
plays a rockabilly tune, "Trailer Park 
Baby," as several large puppets and 
props are set up behind a stage. Fifteen-foot 
cutouts of brooms, keyboards, mops, 
wrenches, and pencils are followed by equally 
large puppets of the Yale bulldog, Handsome 
Dan, in top hat and tails, and workers of all 
colors, ages, and genders. On the makeshift 
stage, the band sings lyrics that foreshadow 
the arrival of the oncoming throng: "Gonna 
get more/Gonna get more/Gonna get more 
than most would." 


About a half-hour after the parents and 
graduates withdraw into the safety of the 
ceremony behind the gates, the buses begin to 
roll in and the cavalcade of locals slowly 
emerges to fill the lawn. Each union group 
wears shirts bearing a unique supportive 
slogan and local union numbers from 6 to 
1707. After a host of speakers, Local 34 
president Laura Smith quickly takes the stage 
and makes the opening pronouncement: 
"Welcome. Thank you and let the party 
begin." 


"Are we in the parade? Are we in the 
parade?" a young girl huddled against her 
father's chest wonders, trying to understand 
her role in the proceedings. 


"Honey, we are the parade," her father 
answers. 


The multitudes enthusiastically cheer on 
the next few speakers, a collection of orators 
including graduating senior Jelani Lawson 
(MC '96), Local 35 president Bob Proto, and 
New Haven NAACP president Roger Vann. 


A troupe of puppeteers from Boston enacts a 
quick play, the climax of which entails the 
Handsome Dan puppet being beaten under a 
deluge of blows from the oversized tools. The 
cheers from the crowd, however, seem to be 
more in anticipation of Jackson's speech. 


But after last night's sermon, Jackson's 
show on the Green is a disappointing sequel. 
At times repeating himself word for word, 
Jackson follows the exact framework of the 
Bridgeport address—only softening the tenor 
of the speech and bringing the intensity and 
unhinged nature of his speaking voice down a 
few notches. He falls back on his familiar 
tropes: "We will keep hope alive. Let us march 
with dignity and discipline and non-violence." 


Leading the march off from the corner of 
Elm and College, a pack of more than 50 
journalists and photographers forges a 
comet's head around Jackson while 
hundreds of workers form a blazing tail. 


For the half-hour it takes the protestors 
to circle Old Campus, including a detour 
which bypasses High Street in favor of 
York, everyone present seems to have a 
sense of purpose: to awaken New Haven 
to the evils of the "dde administration. 


Like a fiery comet disintegrating in 
the atmosphere, the different members of the 
united group break up when they return to 
the New Haven Green. 


Individual interests and activities prevail as 
the group scatters. Dressed in matching hot-
pink lounge suits and brown shades, Dave 
Thomas, Tom Banks, and Arthur Stewart—
all members of Local 35—are the 
International Three, a rhythm and blues 
singing group which performed at the rally 
earlier today. "Yeah. We're trying to get a CD 
out," says Thomas. Unflustered by playing to 
such a large crowd, he minimizes the relative 
size of today's audience, saying, "Now, we've 
played for thousands of people before," then 
quickly acknowledging, "This is a big crowd, 
though." 


Reverend Scott Marks, the head of the 
New Growth Church and another performer 
on today's musical cavalcade of R&B, folk, 
funk, and soul, tries to sell a reporter on doing 
a story about his upstart ministry while 
cooling off in the backstage area. "We're 
different. We're not just a drop-in-here 
church, we're a community church. Come on 
down. Come on down." 


The Green has also become a socialist 
newsstand of sorts. No one would claim that 
they're in competition for the crowd's spare 
change, but it's fairly certain that the 
Proletarian Evolution, the Socialist Worker, 
Abolitionist NYC, Industrial Worker, The 
Militant, Worker Vanguard, People's World 
Weekly, and Labor at the Turning Point all 
share the same target demographic group. 


"Our politics are just working class 
politics," says Rayan Dlamime, with the 
International Socialist Worker Associations. 
"In a place like this it's easy to sell. You know 
there's a big market and you know, whatever, 
none of that red-baiting stuff." 


Perhaps the person having the most fun at 
this event, however, is Devin, a boy about 
nine-years old. He has joined in with a small 
mob of children that have been chasing after 
the Handsome Dan puppet. Modeling 
themselves after the puppeteers who swing 
giant screwdrivers and pens at the papier 
mâché dog, the kids are occasionally able to 
get in a good shot, almost disabling the 
puppet entirely. After a puppeteer finally drags 
the Handsome Dan puppet off to safety, 
Devin answers a few questions for a reporter 
following the scene. 


"Did you have fun hitting the dog and 
chasing around all the people in costumes?" 
the reporter asks. 


"Uhh-huh. Neat!" Devin replies. 


"What made you come down here?" the 
reporter asks. 


"I came with my dad. He's a 
photographer." 


Even though Devin probably doesn't 
understand the intricacies of socialism, the 
union struggle, the Rainbow Coalition, or 
even the ins-and-outs of getting a record deal, 
Commencement sure is fun. Everyone, in 
fact, was able to have their fun because 
nobody wanted to ruin the day for 
anyone else.
