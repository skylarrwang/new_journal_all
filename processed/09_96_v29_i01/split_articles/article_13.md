EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
tough-guy elegance, his hair combed back 
into a pony tail, sporting jeans and a wry 
smile, he talks in a slangy, streetwise way 
about "goin' after the bad guys." On the 
force, White had a reputation for being one 
of the most dedicated police detectives the 
town had ever seen, the kind of cop who 
was "out there" all the time, tracking 
suspects, orchestrating photographed buys, 
often putting in 24-hour days. 


Based on his experience, White knew 
that in an operation as complex as a 
drug raid, timing is everything. That 
means knowing exactly when to stop 
gathering evidence and start making 
arrests. If authorities strike too soon, U.S. 
attorneys may n~t have enough evidence to 
convict, and years of undercover work will 
go to waste. If they wait too long, the 
chances increase that their cover will be 
blown. 


Once a date for a raid has been set, 
timing becomes even more critical. Agents 
have to stay out of sight. If they reveal 
themselves too soon, suspects have the 
chance to bide in their homes, to flee, or 
worse, to arm themselves. The partici-
pating agencies try to choreograph their 
efforts so that every suspect gets a knock on 
the door at the same time. Delays between 
arrests allow suspects time to tip each other 
off by phone, and that means arresting 
agents arrive at empry houses. 


Even a perfectly synchronized raid can 
end in disaster. Drug gangs in New Haven 
have been known to carry Mac-lOs, M-16s, 
and AK-47 automatic assault rifles. As a 
result, the most common incident is the 
plain, old-fashioned shoot-out. To date, no 
New Haven officers have been killed in 
raids, but in 1994 an officer was badly 
wounded. The task force was carrying out a 
drug raid on an after-hours club when 
someone inside opened fire, hitting Officer 
Reginald Sutton in the chest. He owes his 
life to his bulletproof vest. 


As Sutton could testify, New Haven's 
criminals were well-armed. And while the 
legal arsenal provided by federal 
racketeering laws made it easier to bold 
defendants in jail without bail once they 
had been arrested, many of them were stili 
on the street. Merrill Parks, of the New 
Haven FBI, believes that members of 
violent narcotics gangs are past the point of 
no return. Gang members today, he says, 
grow up with a system of values that 
rewards violence. Parks recalls a gang 
member in Washington, DC, who had 
killed 19 people by the time he was 20 
years old. One of his victims was an elderly 
woman who had bumped into him crossing 
the street. He shot her in the head with a 
nine-millimeter pistol. Says Parks, "These 
people are growing up with the cultural 
values of a predator." This point was driven 
home for White one day in 1994. 


Billy White's oldest son, Tyler, was 22. 
He had graduated from Wilbur Cross 
University, where he played football, and 
was working as an orderly at a hospital. On 
the night of May 13, 1994, he met up with 
a young man named Arosmo "Ra Ra" Diaz, 
and the two went to a bar in New Haven. 
They left the bar some time later to go to a 
party in Bridgeport. Early the next 
morning, Tyler's body was found in his car 


Near the car was the bullet-ridden body of 
Diaz. 


Police believe that the Latin Kings 
suspected Diaz of being a police 
informant-a snitch. A godfather of the 
gang had ordered his death. Arosmo was 
the intended target, and Tyler was kilJed 
because he was in the car with him. 
Presumably, the murderers didn't want to 
leave a living witness. 


Three members of the Latin Kings were 
charged with racketeering and murder. 
White attended their trial in Bridgeport 
and listened as recordings were played of a 
conversation between two of the 
defendants, obtained from government 
surveillance. One particularly incrimin-
ating conversation probably clinched the 
guilty verdict when it was played in court: 
"Yo, we fucked up." 
"Why?" 
"Yo, now I know the man was a 
snitch." 
"How do you know?" 
"You know the one that was with them? 
He was a cop's son." 


All three defendants were convicted and 
are now serving life sentences in federal 
prison without the possibility of parole. 
They will be in prison until the day they 
die. 


After the death of his son, White 
continued to head the Drug Gang 
Task Force. The task force took 
the criminal enterprise strategy one step 
further. Just as the RICO statute allowed 
police to dismantle the chain of command 
within the hierarchy of a drug gang, the 
task force now sought to take down the 
next level in the drug gang pyramid. The 
Latin Kings and the Jungle Boys were low-
level distributors, that is, street dealers. 
The street dealers were getting their drugs 
from somewhere, and when police 
intelJigence suggested that the source was 
local, the NHPD decided that cutting off 
the lifeblood of the New Haven gangs 
might prevent them from coming back. 


The thinking behind this move was 
the same as the strategy for waging the 
war on drugs everywhere, from inner-city 
street gangs to international cartels. Drugs 
don't go directly from the farms in South 
America into a drug user's vein: they make 
stops along the way. At each of these 
stops, the drugs change hands, going 
through smaller and smaller suppliers 
until they reach street dis'tribution 
networks in U.S. cities. This is what 
police mean when they talk about 
different "levels" of dealership. The higher 
a dealer is on the drug distribution ladder, 
the more valuable the arrest is to the 
police. This principle holds true all the 
way up to the Colombian drug lords, such 
as the multibillionaire kingpins of the 
notorious Cali cocaine cartel, whose drug 
empire supplies 85 percent of drugs in 
America, and grosses about $7 billion per 
ye:u in U.S. profits alone. 


In 1993, NHPD already knew about a 
local crack dealer named Sal Bova. Rather 
than arresting Bova right away, police 
waited to see who his supplier was. They 
watched him sell drugs to a cocaine-
runner from Queens, then arrested them 
both. The supplier, it turned out, was 
Diego Alexander Holguin-a Colombian 
national. When the police searched him, 
they turned up three items of interest: 
eight ounces of cocaine, $12,000 in cash, 
and a scrap of paper. The scrap of paper 
had a telephone number scribbled on it. 
Police traced the number, eventually 


netting a goldmine of incriminating 
material: an address book of dealers and 
suppliers. Police stepped up surveillance, 
using court-authorized wiretaps to tap the 
phone lines of suspected suppliers. Things 
proceeded without too many surprises 
until police traced calls to Cali, 
Colombia's cocaine capital. FBI Special 
Agent Robert Grispino explains, "As the 
New Haven case developed, they 
identified Colombians-actual real live 
guys from Colombia, part of the cartel, 
who were distributing cocaine to the 
different areas." 


According to DEA head Thomas 
Constantine, the Cali cartel is "bigger 
than the Mafia in the U.S. ever was." In 
his words, the Cali cartel is "the biggest 
organized-crime syndicate there has ever 
been." Realizing that they had stumbled 
onto one of history's largest crime 
syndicates right in their own town, the 
task force turnedÂ· up the heat, sending 
officers in to pose as drug buyers. Using 
marked government money, undercover 
agents bought cocain e and heroin. It 
became clear the Fair Haven ring was a 
big supplier, probably supplying to many 
local gangs. 


Over the summer, the task force had 
secretly indicted 32 people, and now it 
was finally time to act on the warrants. At 
exactly 6 a.m., the task force executed a 
coordinated sweep, simultaneously 
arresting 29 out of the 32 people indicted. 
The arrests in the New Haven area all 
proceeded without incident. Afterwards, 
FBI special agent Robert Grispino was 
struck by the intensity of the emotion 
displayed. "It was quite a sight," he told 
reporters. "With some of the New Haven 
cops, there were tears in their eyes." Billy 
White, of course, was among them. "We 


got some big fish, too, guys that handled 
multi, multi, multi kilos," says White. 
"That was the biggest one we've ever 
done." 


Of the 29 arrested, about 13 were 
Colombian nationals. The task force had 
successfully apprehended many of the 
importers and distributors that had 
connections with source companies. "The 
core organization that they arrested here 
in New Haven had direct connections 
with Miami, San Juan, and Cali," says 
Grispino. "And that's proven." 


Meanwhile, the entire Cali cartel 
leadership has been apprehended by an 
elite Colombian police squad. In the past 
year, eight of the top nine Cali drug lords 
have given themselves up to Colombian 
authorities or been killed in gunfights 
with police. 


The task force's operations have 
proven to be so successful that they have 
attracted national attention. DEA 
Director Thomas Constantine touts New 
Haven as an example of the good that the 
war on drugs is doing on a community 
level by helping to "clean up the streets." 
In a recent White House news conference, 
Attorney General Janet Reno talked about 
the success of the war on drugs, citing the 
pilot program in New Haven, and 
pledging to "repeat New Haven's success 
across the nation." 


As for Billy White and his team, rhey 
continue to do what they have always 
done. "I think eventually we can win the 
war on drugs," says White. "I'll probably 
be gone by then. But I think someday, we'll 
work our way out of a job, and there won't 
be any more gangs left in this city."
