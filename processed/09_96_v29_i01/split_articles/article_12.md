Pollee Lieutenant Billy White and his task force are cleaning ap the 
streets of New Iavan. Last September they orchestrated lila

Around him, in the cavernous

police-issued weapons. Some 
were patrolmen, wearing police 
uniforms, while others were 
undercover. Around him, 
White recognized state troopers, special agents from the Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA), deputies from the U.S. 
Marshal's office, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) special 
agents, and other police detectives. There were anti-narcotics case 
agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), 
and intelligence officers from the West Haven, East Haven, 
Hamden, and New Haven police departments. White looked 
around. These were his people, the ones who would be by his side 
on the front lines. ftiS waa llle •e• HaweD Drag IMg

It was 3 a.m. on September 28, 1995, and most of the men had 
been up since the morning before. None of them would sleep that 
night either. They had a big 
day ahead of them.


Hours earlier, White had 
been in his office, writing out 
paperwork and preparing 
warrants. Meanwhile, Tweed-
New Haven Airport had 
quietly filled with federal 
agents, flying in from New 
York and Washington, DC. 
They had then rendezvoused 
at the southwestern corner of 
the city to talk strategy. The 
team's field headquarters that 
night would be Coxe Cage, a 
warehouse of a building 
conveniently tucked away in 
Yale's athletic fields on the 
very edge of town. 


The 300-man coalition of feds, state police, and local police 
had gathered to discuss the next step in the war on drugs. White 
listened as his friend Kevin Kline, an FBI special agent and one of 
the original members of the task force, delivered a r~~ng seeech 
to the law enforcement army that had assembled. ODe laid 
oat tbe battle plaD for Ole ........... nat: the 
agents were to organize themselves into tactical squads, forming 
arrest teams and back-up crews. The teams assigned to carry out 
raids received arrest packets containing the names, addresses, and 
photographs of each suspect, as well as search warrants authorized 
in federal court. At 5:30 a.m., the teams were to split up, each 
reporting to their designated arrest sites in New Haven, East 
Haven, West Haven, North Haven, and Branford to prepare for the 
final phase of the operation: making the arrests. As 
he listened, White asked himself whether this team 
could pull off a successful operation. 


Born and raised in New Haven, White still 
remembered a time when New Haven was 
considered a peaceful town. "This used to be a great 
city," says White. In 1960, only six murders, four 
rapes, and 16 robberies were reported. Ia 1110, 
tllare ware II audara, 118 rapa, ud 
1,714 rebllerlea. Gangs sprayed bullets at 
schoolbuses; they also killed a six-year-old girl, 
mistaking her parents' car for that of a rival gang. In 
1991, half of the homicides reported in the city were 
the result of gang violence. In the early 1990s, White 
was a patrol sergeant. "Back then it was hell," he 
recalls. "I thought, 'What are we doing?'" 


fte alhlatlea ••-•d llepeleaa fer 
... lavu, ud It did aet appear tllal 
llelp waa ea tile way. In Washington, DC, 
the White House was losing its own war on drugs. 
Despite the Republican administration's intensifying 
counterattacks, the government's efforts failed to 
make a dent in the supply on the streets. Law 
enforcement agencies tried everything: they deployed 
military forces equipped with superior hardware, 
increased federal drug seizures tenfold, and began to 
exert diplomatic pressure on drug-supplying 
counrries to curtail drug production. Border controls 
were tightened. But none of this seemed to have an 
effect on the tide of drugs flowing in. The supply of 
drugs kept mushrooming, and drug seizures that had 
always been measured in grams and pounds were 
now measured in tons. By the early 1990s, the 
physical proliferation of street drugs was so heavy 
that random laboratory tests showed that almost every U.S. bill in 
circulation bore trace amounts of cocaine. 


In New Haven, residents feared for their lives. laa1a were 
tarrarbla1 tile city, but at the time, the police chief would 
not acknowledge that gangs even existed in New Haven. Says 
White, "Maybe he didn't know we had a gang problem. I knew we 
had a gang problem." The transactional crime-fighting techniques 
used by the local police were not working. Sting operations where 
police bought drugs or guns on the street and then arrested 
members low in the gang hierarchy had little impact because small-
time dealers did not have much control over the market. Street 
level dealerships were easy to replace, requiring little money, 
influence, and firepower, so arresting street runners merely created 
vacancies for eager new dealers to move in. "They were in, they 
were out, they were back on the streets," recalls White. "We were 
banging our heads against the wall." 


The New Haven Police Department (NHPD) did the only 
thing it could do: it asked for help. Past attempts to coordinate 
federal and local authorities had failed as inter-agency cooperation 
degenerated into clashing egos and competition over who was in 
charge; but now, the federal agencies responded. A meeting was 
called berween federal law enforcement agencies and the NHPD. 
The New Haven Drug Gang Task Force was born. 


Task force members soon realized that involving federal 
agencies in the anti-gang offensive had distinct advantages. fte

scale aperatl••• and invest the necessary time and expertise 
to achieve the "takedown" of the drug gangs. 


Members of the task force knew that to shut down the gang 
leadership, federal prosecutors needed powerful laws, since many 
gang bosses seemed above the law. Some had never acrually pulled 
the trigger or sold drugs on the srreets themselves, choosing instead 
to control their operations by sending orders down and waiting for 
money to flow up. The task force began to target drug gangs 
systematically, beginning in 1992 with a narcotics street gang 
known as the Jungle Boys, which had been identified as the most 
violent gang in the area. 


To dismantle the leadership of the Jungle Boys and other 
criminal networks, federal investigators in New Haven rapidly 
became experts at going after racketeering indictments using a set 
of federal statutes known as the Racketeering Influenced and 
Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Originally enacted in 1970 to
