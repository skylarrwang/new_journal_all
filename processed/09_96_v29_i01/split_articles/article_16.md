the residents 
earn their living from timber harvesting and processing. Local 
environmental groups have held up hundreds of timber sales with 
administrative and judicial appeals. These appeals have decreased the 
volume of timber now sold from federal land (which makes up 75 
percent of the forest base cut in the region), to one-tenth of what it 
~ 
eight years ago. Tension between environmentalists and loggers is 
tight here, like a fist gripped behind every conversation. 
"The old ways of confrontation and polarization just don't work," 
said John Gordon, professor and former dean of the Yale School of 
Forestry and Environmental Studies. "With the spotted owl fight a 
couple years ago, no one really won. Sure, donations to 
environmental organizations went up, but with concessions under the 
recent salvage rider law, these groups are no more certain of saving the 
owl. Wood prices for industry also went up, but the companies laid 
off hundreds of employees, broke families." 
This past February, Gordon was the co-chairperson of the Seventh 
American Forest Congress in Washington, DC, a meeting that 
brought together loggers, environmentalists, and forestry experts from 
across the country to develop a shared vision for managing the 
nation's forest land. 


This congress, part of a series of meetings that have influenced 
national forest policy since 1882, is the first of its kind since 1975. 
This year it drew 1,300 people from across the country to develop 
broad goals for the nation's public and private forests. "Forest 
managers can't continue to operate without knowing what people in 
this country want from their forests," Gordon said. "And we can't 
come any closer to resolving major environmental problems until we 
find out where we all agree." 
The Flathead Forestry Project (FFP), an organization that started 
in Kalispell, Montana in 1994, has been called a model for local 
citizen efforts around the country. FFP aims to substitute honest 
discussion for faceless rhetoric and replace airless meetings with 
hands-on demonstrations. FFP is also one of the country's most 
ambitious groups; seeking to change logging laws on all federal land. 
T
he Fl~thead roundtable, held in Kalispell last January, was one 
of over 90 meetings across the country that led up to the 
Seventh American Forest Congress. Here, citizens developed 
"vision" statements to describe ideal forests, "principles" to further 
those visions, and concrete "next steps." All these comments were sent 
to the congress office in New Haven where words and phrases were 
added or extracted so each submission could carry the flavor of 
dozens. The refined visions and principles were voted on at the Forest 
Congress in Washington, DC, last February. 
Almost 50 people attended the Flathead roundtable, many of 
them members of FFP. Sitting at my table was Gideon Fauth from 
F.H. Stoltze Land and Lumber Co., a medium-sized timber company 
in the area. He was big and ruddy-faced and wore an old sweatshirt 
and jeans. "Our forests are in dis-gust-ing condition," he said, 
paunching his lips at each syllable. "They're bein' destroyed by fire or 
ice storms or dwarf mistletoe comin' in like cancer and instead 'a
