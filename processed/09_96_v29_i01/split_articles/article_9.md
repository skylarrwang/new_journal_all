Naples Hops on the Wagon 
A dark room, 1980s music on the 
jukebox, strange faces, and a plastic pitcher 
of beer perpetually on the table: this image 
of my first few nights at Yale resembles 
that of many undergraduates. 

For upperclassmen and alumni alike, a 
cold pitcher of watered-down beer at 
Naples embodies the very essence of their 
freshman-year experience. Traditionally, 
Thursday nights at Naples, which has 
called itself "the 13th residential college," 
are flooded with the younger members of 
Yale's beer-guzzling, pizza-loving crowd 
who want to hang out and drink. Indeed, 
sharing a pitcher at Naples with new 
classmates has cemented many a budding 
friendship and created many a blurry 
memory. 

But no longer, says Tony Prifitera, the . 
restaurant's manager. "Things have to 
change-we just don't have a choice." The 
pitcher, which formerly allowed one 
person to buy and others to drink, is now 
gone. Instead of these communal 
containers acquired at the counter, 16-
ounce glasses are served by one of five 
recently-hired waitresses, in accordance 
with Connecticut state law. And, to many 
people's dismay, a valid ID card is now 
required. 

This drastic measure is in direct 
response to a $2,500 fine imposed by the 
Connecticut State Liquor Control after 
Naples was busted last November for 
underage drinking. 

On Friday and Saturday nights, Sasha 
Mandl (MUS '96) now stands in the well-
lit entrance stamping a big black "21" on 
the hands of customers who intend to 
consume alcohol only after they have 
proven they are of age. After several years 
studying at Yale, Mandl knows what goes 
on in New Haven. "No one gets by me," 
he declares with confidence. "~d no one 
buys me, either." 

Many students have heard rumors 
about the social upheaval. One junior tried 
his luck on a Thursday night with a fake 
ID. The waitress called his bluff and 
confiscated the fake. In the end, the 
manager returned the bogus ID, but only 
after the underage drinker had signed a slip 
of paper ackno~ledging his responsibility. 
His signature would have protected Naples 
had the police conducted a raid that night. 

Disgruntled upperclassmen who have 
not yet turned 21 bemoan the loss of their 
pitcher-filled youth, while bewildered 
freshmen seem unsure what to 
make of the news. The Naples 
staff is confident, however, that 
students will continue to flock 
into the restaurant once more in 
accordance with Connecticut state 
laws and in keeping with an only 
slightly altered tradition of 30 
years.

**Can the Coalition Coalesce?**

Can the Coalition 
Coalesce? 
New Haven does not seem like 
fertile ground for the Christian 
Coalition. 

The 
Coalition's 
membership is overwhelmingly 
Republican, while New Haven is 
overwhelmingly Democratic. The 
Coalition is chiefly a Southern Baptist 
institution, and Southern Baptists are 
relatively scarce in this city. Moreover, New 
Haven is home to our fair school, which 
religious conservatives have damned for 
decades as a bastion of liberalism and 
atheism. 

None of which dissuades Brian Green 
(PC '80), founder of the Coalition's latest 
chapter. An evangelical Pentecostal, he 
contends that devout Christians in New 
Haven are underrepresented by com-
munity organizations, and that their 
churches have abandoned Christian 
principles by adopting liberal ways. New 
Haven also holds a particular place in the 
Coalition's history: it is the place where 
founder Pat Robertson (LAW '55) once 
studied. 

In spite of Green's enthusiasm, I was 
altogether skeptical of the new chapter's 
chances for success. When I ~ntered its 
first meeting-a "pro-life night" -ten 
minutes late as the last member of an 
audience that numbered only six people, I 
thought my suspicions were confirmed. 

Soon after I arrived, Green, a very tall, 
thin man, stood up in the front of the 
room and led the audience in a forgettable 
prayer. He introduced himself and spoke 
briefly about the mission of the New 
Haven Christian Coalition chapter: "Our 
job is to drag this society slowly but surely 
back toward the foundation of Christian 
principles that this nation was built on. It's 
a hard job, but somebody has to do it." 

Green then introduced Jane Salce, the 
leader of the Christian Coalition in 
Connecticut. A short, middle-aged woman 
with tan skin and hair tied back in a bun, 
Salce delivered a not-entirely-coherent 
series of words about the Christian 
Coalition's political agenda. In keeping 
with the Republican message of the 
moment-the meeting was held on the last 
night of the conven tion in San 
Diego-Salce attempted to downplay the 
significance of abortion by mentioning 
other issues. "We have a problem with 
taxes, we have a problem with education,
