EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
In early August, Cord Jefferson was hired as the West Coast Editor for online publication 
Gawker, after a job as a senior editor for GOOD magazine. In between editorial positions, Jefferson 
has built a rich repertoire of  articles freelanced for outlets including The Nation, National 
Geographic, NPR and The Root. He often writes on topics related to race and class. He sat down 
with The New Journal to discuss diversity in media today.


Aliyya Swaby: You’re the second black editor 
Gawker has ever had. Why is this significant?
CJ:  I think that there are things that you simply 
can’t do as a publication and viewpoints that are hard to 
come by without having a lot of diversity on staff. In an 
increasingly multiracial nation with an African-American 
in the White House; if you don’t have a significant 
number of people of color on staff, you’re approaching 
irrelevance.


Juliana Hanle: You wrote an article for BET 
News this summer about racial disparity in 
marijuana use  prosecution in the US. How and 
when do you decide to approach articles using a 
racial angle?
CJ: I have no interest in being the guy that’s 
cramming racial stuff down people’s throats. Having 
said that, I think there’s no way to get around the fact 
that race has influence over pretty much everything that 
happens in society -- from politics and criminal justice to 
music and fashion and real estate. 
I do often feel pulled to discuss the racial element 
because it fascinates me. Privilege is invisible. If you’re 
middle class or a wealthy white person in America, you 
don’t see how your race affects everything that you do. 
The thing that’s a blessing and a curse for brown, 
black, females, and other minorities, is that you’re able 
to see how often race influences your life. In most 
cases, “playing the race card” is just a person of color 
acknowledging that race is a real thing that exists, and 
that there’s a power dynamic that goes along with it. 


AS: In The Root last April you described being 
a “formerly angry black man” before going to anger 
management. Could you have written an article like 
that one in a publication that wasn’t specifically 
from an African-American perspective? 
CJ: Absolutely. Gawker has been open to me writing 
about racial stuff. They have never said no to pitches 
that deal with race. The smarter outlets and publications 
see that these are important issues. You can’t just publish 
something anymore that caters exclusively to straight 
white men. 


AS: What do you think mainstream media 
outlets should do to improve the diversity of  their 
newsrooms?
CJ: People should be very earnest and direct about 
fact that they want to hire people of color, women, and 
gay people. The fact that you’re looking for a diverse 
newsroom is not something about which to be ashamed.


Not having a diversity of opinion will start to 
make people look foolish, like it made Tina Brown and 
Newsweek look foolish for propagating nonsense about 
all Muslims being violent. 


JH: Can you point to one key lesson you took 
from your experience studying sociology in college?
CJ: Sociology helped me understand that the idea 
that certain groups of people are civilized and others 
are uncivilized is kind of meaningless. The barriers we 
put in place to restrict ourselves from one another are all 
manmade. I went to William and Mary—I would imagine 
Yale is kind of similar. Those kinds of environments are 
really tough places in which to get a real sense of what’s 
going on outside of campus. People struggle with things 
that many William and Mary or Yale students don’t 
struggle with. Sociology taught me that those people’s 
lives were not worth any less than the life I was leading. 
They were just as valuable, interesting, and important 
as mine. 


JH: At The New Journal, our writers, some of  
whom come from privileged backgrounds, find 
themselves writing about a city where a lot of  social 
issues deal with race and socioeconomic status. Do 
you have advice for a college student handling these 
issues?
CJ: I’m the same way. I’m a person of color but 
at the same time, my mom’s white. I also come from a 
middle class background–my dad’s a lawyer. The best 
advice I can give is not to be embarrassed not to know 
things, not to be embarrassed to feel uncomfortable in a 
place. Some of the greatest pieces I read, whether they’re 
creative fiction or creative nonfiction or journalism, are 
about people who find themselves in uncomfortable 
positions: places where they don’t know a lot, where 
they have to work really hard to understand why they’re 
feeling the way they are about what they’re encountering. 
The best piece of advice you can give anybody is, 
don’t go to a place with an agenda. 


AS: You have an active Tumblr you update 
regularly. How does the site interact with your 
journalistic writing? 
CJ: I can’t tell you how many times things I put on 
Tumblr and Twitter have become the kernel of some 
other bigger story that I was working on. Being able to 
put your ideas into a quick safe space like that and to see 
what people say about them is beautiful. 


AS: You recently came under fire for a Gawker 
article you wrote arguing that pedophilia should be 
considered a sexual orientation, and in subsequent 
blog posts, you apologized for some of  the article’s 
shortcomings. How should a writer deal with the 
possibility of  backlash when reporting on sensitive 
topics?
CJ: You have to have thick skin, especially when 
you’re going to write about topics that are really 
sensitive, like gender issues and race issues. You have to 
go in knowing people will be angry. The pedophile piece 
is a perfect example. I talked to my editors about it and 
we knew that it would make some people hate me right 
away. You have to be willing to admit that you may be 
wrong and be willing to discuss things. 

There were a lot of rational critiques of 
that piece, but there were also a lot of irrational ones. 
There’s a great Ricky Gervais quote, “Just because 
you’re offended doesn’t mean you’re in the right.” Right 
now we have to realize that the Internet is like the Wild 
West. You have to be willing to take heat, be yelled at. 
After that pedophile piece came out, this feminist writer 
and editor in New York who I really respect e-mailed 
me said, “Hey, if you want to talk about the responses 
people are having, then let’s talk.” We chatted for two 
hours. For me, that conversation was worth a million 
people yelling at me online.
