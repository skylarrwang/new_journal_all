Beads, Weeds, and Palaces
When Gabriel Prieto was a little boy, he ran around 
the hills of Huanchaco, Peru, collecting tiny beads and 
shiny ceramic fragments. As a fifth year PhD candidate 
at Yale, his perspective has changed, but he hasn’t 
stopped running his fingers through the soil. Prieto has 
spent the last two years excavating the 4000-year-old 
remains of the north coast Peruvian fishing village of 
Pampas Gramalote. Beginning in the summer of 2010, 
he picked carefully through layers of dirt, finding the 
decaying remains of totora reeds still twisted together in 
ropes as if just released from a fisherman’s hands. With 
surprise and delight he found that the ancient fishermen 
of Pampas extracted red pigments from plants and 
shark lipids in order to dye the cloths they tied to fishing 
nets—the same red cloths fishermen in Huanchaco tie 
on their nets today.

A century earlier, in 1911, Yale assistant professor 
of Latin American history Hiram Bingham III and two 
Peruvian colleagues followed a native boy high up into 
Peru’s mountains, where they stepped into the remains 
of Incan imperial city Machu Picchu. The tops of 
stone walls and terraces barely showed beneath a mass 
of jungle and wild vegetation. As he gazed out at the 
ethereal ruins, Bingham likely felt great awe.

Though separated by a hundred years, Prieto 
and Bingham shared what has now become a guiding 
principle of Yale’s archaeology department: the desire 
to academically, cross-culturally collaborate. Prieto 
thinks of today’s efforts as essentially finishing the 
project that Bingham began a century ago, when he 
entered Peru with the intention of studying its ancient 
culture. Until recently, the legacy of Bingham’s work has 
not represented this sensibility. In 2011, Yale and Peru 
agreed on terms for the repatriation of the artifacts that 
Bingham had excavated, with the Peruvian government’s 
blessing. By November 2012 the collection would be 
fully returned and available to both parties at the newly 
launched Universidad Nacional San Antonio Abad del 
Cusco-Yale University International Center for the 
Study of Machu Picchu and Inca Culture, accessible to 
faculty and students from both universities. 

Through the efforts of Richard Burger ’72, chair 
and director of graduate studies for Archaeology, Yale 
students should have the opportunity to take part in 
the excavation of the Casa Concha, a fifteenth century 
Incan palace and home to the center, next summer. They 
would work alongside archaeology students from the 
University of Cusco. The dig would serve as part of a 
practical course—provided it receives enough funding, 
likely from Yale donors.

And Prieto hopes to contribute to Professor 
Burger’s effort. Although Prieto has already worked 
with several students from Yale and from his Peruvian 
alma mater, the University of Trujillo, he wants to draw 
these two groups together in a formalized, meaningful 
way through collaboration on his project in Pampas 
Gramalote. He contextualized Burger’s work, saying, “it 
is all part of this larger dream.” 

Achieving productive cross-cultural collaboration 
has only become possible as archaeology departments 
have exhibited increased interest in non-Western 
civilizations. In the time since Burger was an 
undergraduate at Yale, the field of Peruvian archaeology 
has grown dramatically. He took the “Introduction to 
Peruvian Archaeology” course that he now teaches and 
claims that seventy percent of what he was taught then 
has been superseded by new information. At one point 
during his fifteen field seasons in Peru, he was able to 
name a previously-unstudied pre-Incan culture. “I always 
saw the work of Andean archaeologists as corrective 
[of] the biased and racist notion that there’s only one 
important center of civilization,” he said. The volume 
of information unearthed in the field of Peruvian 
archaeology during Burger’s tenure is a testament to the 
“I always saw the work of  
Andean archaeologists as 
corrective [of] the biased 
and racist notion that 
there’s only one important 
center of  civilization.”
