When she stood in front of the podium at Stony 
Brook, presenting the discoveries she and her colleagues 
had made about the die-off, Cuomo became the face of 
the scientific establishment. “I was personally vilified 
by Billy Joel,” she said. “He was out defending the 
lobstermen.”

Cuomo is sympathetic to the plight of the 
lobstermen. Her cousin is a lobsterman, and she 
supports the lobster-catching culture. “I am not anti-
lobsterman,” she said again and again. 

Yet lobstermen like Michael Fraenza still blame the 
government for the die-off, and hold a grudge against 
the scientists who determined that insecticides were 
not the primary cause. The Connecticut Department 
of Energy and Environmental Protection  continues 
to conduct research on the insecticides, as yet without 
conclusions. “They’re really killing us,” Fraenza told me. 
“I’ve been in the business for fifty years, and I’m just 
barely hanging on.”

In order to make ends meet, Fraenza traded his 
wire-mesh lobster pots for metal dredges that sweep up 
conches and clams. Shellfish get pushed into the bars at 
the back of the dredge by a jet of water. It is hard not to 
see the lobstermen’s fate in the work of the dredge. The 
lobstermen too have been pushed into a corner by an 
unfortunate confluence of circumstances. 

Fraenza still goes out at six every morning aboard 
the Rock’n’Roll, while the fishermen he has hired man 
his other two boats. New hires still lean overboard, 
puking their guts out for the first week. Fraenza keeps 
his eye on the horizon, checking for the next day’s 
weather. And families still brave the forbidding exterior 
of Fair Haven Clam & Lobster to buy fresh seafood. 
But it isn’t the same. The lobsters crawling around in the 
green, algae-covered basins now come from Maine and 
eastern Canada. 

“I hear stories of hundreds and hundreds and 
hundreds of lobsters coming in,” said Evette Gilbert, 
who sells the seafood for Fraenza from the basement 
room of Fair Haven Clam & Lobster. “They say people 
were lined up down the street to buy lobsters. Back then 
Michael was doing better.”

A family comes into the room, which is cooled by 
seawater cycling through the lobster tanks, and they pick 
out three crustaceans, one for each of them. They know 
that in a few hours, these antennae will stop twiddling 
and these tails will stop flicking. What they don’t know is 
how many tails and claws and antennae probed the mud 
a few nautical miles away just twenty years ago. They 
don’t know that these mud-dwellers gave rise to a unique 
lifestyle in and around New Haven; nor do they know 
just how rare that lifestyle has become.
