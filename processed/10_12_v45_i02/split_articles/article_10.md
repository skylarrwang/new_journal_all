Tom James stood at the head of his algebra 
classroom his back to a poster that urged students to 
“question everything.” For my benefit, he asked his 
students if they knew the basics of their school’s new 
philosophy. Why had High School in the Community 
decided to eliminate grades in favor of a mastery-based 
evaluation system? Fifteen first-year students stared 
back at him in brief, confused silence.


“So we can get ready for college and stuff,” one girl 
offered after a few seconds.


The magnet school’s new system replaces grades 
with numbers, one through four, to indicate how well 
students understand a certain concept, with a three 
indicating a satisfactory passing score. Although they 
still have homework and tests, in most classes that 
have implemented the system, students may choose to 
test out of a unit when they feel most prepared. The 
school hopes this change will create an environment 
of exploration and understanding, rather than rigid, 
systematic instruction. 


But many students are confused, which springs 
from the fact that they are barely acquainted with the 
new system. It has been in place only since the end of 
August. Administrators would like for them to eventually 
have a measure of control over their own education 
and for the current uncertainty to give way to clarity, 
awareness, and self-determination. 


In the cafeteria one Friday morning, throngs of 
students crowded around small tables for their lunch 
break, laughing and talking. Shawnece Jackson sat alone 
at a small round table, texting. Like the students in 
James’ class, she offered only a hesitant explanation for 
the change.


“It’s helpful…because they want us to graduate and 
[the mastery system] is making it easier,” she faltered. All 
courses for freshmen or “foundation level” students will 
apply the new mastery-based system, and so will some 
upper-level courses. The partial implementation leaves 
some upperclassmen feeling particularly confused.


High School in the Community doesn’t have a 
principal. Instead, it has a Building Leader, an elected 
position currently occupied by Erik Good, a former 
English teacher at the school. An affable, easygoing 
man, he rarely sits in his office, instead spending much 
of his time making rounds and visiting the school’s 
thirty-four teachers and more than two hundred fifty 
students. He maintains a decisive calm that suggests that 
his two years of experience at High School have made 
him comfortable with his position’s requirements.


Good said the school’s courses are designed to 
instill an element of “character education.” He believes 
the magnet school’s major goal is to allow space for 
its students’ individual self-expression within a larger 
community both inside and outside of the explicitly 
educational experience. “How do we function as a 
group, as a country, and still maintain our individuality?” 
he asked. This emphasis on civic values, formalized in 
the curriculum as a “Law and Social Justice” theme , 
hearkens back to the school’s roots in the liberal 1970s, 
when a collective of teachers founded High School in 
the Community as a magnet school.


Because the school transitioned to the mastery-
based system so recently, teachers and administrators 
have not yet decided how to apply it practically. One 
difficulty lies in determining the bare minimum students 
must know in order to “master” a subject. How can 
teachers determine the exact limit of comprehension 
while ensuring that students graduate in a timely fashion? 
Academic Coordinator Chris Kafoglis, who oversees 
curriculum and teaching at the school, stresses the 
commitment of the school’s employees to laying down a 
concrete framework for the mastery system, something 
they hope to develop over the next three years. 


The goal, Kafoglis asserts, is that the overall system 
emphasizes continuous, necessarily self-motivated 
learning.


“There are lots of kids who have been told in middle 
school, if you don’t do this you’re going to be held back, 
and over and over and over again they’re not held back,” 
Kafoglis stressed. “The difficulty [with mastery-based 
learning] is that when kids have been getting by with 
a sixty, they have to learn to make progress now.” 


To ease his students into the new system, James 
encourages them to think of each assignment as another 
“draft” until they reach the acceptable mastery levels of 
three or four. Students should only request to test out of 
a unit when they feel prepared. James said students who 
initially attempted to use the system as an opportunity 
to avoid all tests became self-motivated once they fell 
behind classmates who progressed independently 
through topics. 


“Every week that goes by, I see more students start 
to understand what the point is,” he said. Good said that 
he hopes they will by the end of the year.


More radical plans have yet to be implemented. 
Eventually, teachers and administrators say classes 
may be eliminated entirely, with students working at 
their own pace and receiving occasional guidance from 
instructors. But both student understanding and the 
mastery system itself have many stages of development 
ahead. Administrators must communicate their big ideas 
for the future first and foremost with students to ensure 
both develop in tandem with one another.
