Couch Surfing is changing the nature of 
travel. When I travelled around Europe last summer 
— without the help of Couch Surfing — I felt most 
connected to the cultures I experienced when interacting 
with the people I met along the way. Having meaningful 
conversations with the man renting me a bike a town 
outside of Paris, or the Swiss man and his mother on 
a train through the heart of Germany, or even a roofer 
from Oakland who had been at the running of the bulls 
in Pamplona the week before, made me feel like I was 
part of a greater global network and sharpened my sense 
of how the world works.


According to Jeremy Rifkin, a best-selling 
author and economic advisor to the European 
Parliament, the technological and economic innovations 
that have pushed human history forward are also pulling 
us together. In his book The Empathetic Civilization, 
Rifkin argues that we have a natural impulse toward 
empathy and that globalization 
nurtures this impulse by exposing 
us to more people from more 
places. We have moved, he claims, 
from a macro-society of diffuse, 
conflicting communities to a 
more cohesive, communicative 
one. I believe that Couch Surfing 
is both a result and an agent of 
this change—it exists because 
the world is increasingly tolerant, 
and it helps to connect individual 
communities even further. 


In 
the 
past 
three 
years, undergraduates living off 
campus at 216 Dwight St. have 
hosted many Couch Surfers, and 
it became a tradition of the house. Travelers slept in a 
sunny nook on the house’s first floor — last year, there 
were two comfortable black sofas perfect for weary 
bodies, and they had extra mats in case people come in 
groups larger than two.


When Brandon Jackson ‘13 lived there last year, 
he and his housemates hosted seven groups of Surfers 
from Germany, China, Poland, and Russia as well as 
within the US. One girl visiting from Asheville, North 
Carolina, came to New Haven to undergo month-long 
treatment for Lyme disease, and the housemates offered 
to let her stay for an extended period of time. The first 
night she was in the house, she figured out how to fix 
their house’s fireplace, which had been broken for years. 
She also offered to pay some money for the utilities bill.


There’s an unspoken code of ethics among Surfers, 
Jackson said. Many offer to help out around the 
house or contribute to the household in any way 
they can. People know and respect the etiquette. “If not, 
it quickly escalates into an uncomfortable situation,” he 
said. But the code differs by country. Like Song, Jackson 
took a year off from Yale, in his case after sophomore 
year. He has Surfed about fifty times in his travels 
around Europe and the United States. None of his hosts 
asked him to cook or clean in the European countries 
he stayed in. “When I was traveling, I was treated like a 
prince,” he said. 


Jackson lives on campus this year in Calhoun 
and plans to host travelers in his single this year. He 
said he would give up his bed and spend the night 
somewhere else. He said he hosts Couch Surfers because 
the happiness he gains from it never diminishes, even 
as he brings in more and more people. Each experience 
seems brand new.


The New Haven Couch 
Surfing community gets together 
once in a while—they had three 
or four meetups last spring. 
People connect through the 
online Yale/New Haven group 
on the Couch Surfing website, 
which consists mostly of Yale 
students and alumni. When I 
browse the site’s accompanying 
discussion board, I find a wide 
variety of requests. A Yale couple 
from Ohio, “Mike and Jing,” are 
looking for someone to move 
into a house a one-minute walk 
away from New Haven’s beach 
on the Long Island Sound. In 
July, a user named Dessi sent out a message asking 
for participants in “Tuesday Trivia.” Shawn and Molly 
Persinger advertised a musical event: “PRESTER JOHN: 
Live House Concert.” A man named Torsten asked the 
board where he could find 0.0 strength colored contact 
lenses near New Haven. The nature of the community 
allows them to ask for almost anything and they seem 
to expect their requests, no matter how peculiar, to be 
answered. In addition to connecting travelers in person, 
Couch Surfing has established a culture of expectation 
and reward, of communal exchange.  


Most Couch Surfers that stay with hosts from 
the Yale/New Haven group are students. Jeeva John, 
a fourth year medical student at the University of 
Glasgow, traveled from Scotland to New Haven to work 
with a Yale neurologist for five weeks last summer. She
