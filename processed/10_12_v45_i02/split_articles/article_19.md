said, is bathroom signs. The way the signs graphically 
represent men and women is alienating to those who may 
not identify with those representations. Ofosu, Reveiz, 
and DeLeon are searching for gender-fluid graphics–
one café in Santa Cruz has a robot graphic on one of its 
bathroom doors and an alien on the other. The point is to 
illustrate that choosing of a bathroom should primarily 
be based on personal preference, Reveiz said. After two 
brainstorming and planning sessions, they plan to gather 
a group to replace bathroom signs around New Haven 
on October 26. “It’s an intervention because it actually 
exists as a change in urban space,” Ofosu said. 
Ofosu and Reveiz both graduated from Yale last 
May, and DeLeon is a member of the class of 2014, 
currently taking a semester off to focus on PAC. 
They have all studied art since coming to New Haven. 
DeLeon is an actor and Theater Studies major. Reveiz 
is a poet and playwright. Ofosu majored in History of 
Art and started creating art of her own during junior 
year, inspired by Guy Debord’s Society of  the Spectacle and 
its interpretation of ethical representations and how 
images function under capitalism. The three share a 
progressive political worldview; Reveiz is a community 
organizer, and he, Ofosu, and DeLeon became close 
with members of the Occupy New Haven movement. 
They started PAC, Reveiz said, because they wanted 
to have an independent voice that was not dictated by 
“some bullshit art world standards, expectations, or 
definitions of success.” They said they are presenting an 
alternative way of living, one that “provides resources 
for people outside dominant modes of capitalism.” By 
creating a space where anyone can create art, they are 
empowering members of the New Haven community. 
Their Yale education may seem at odds with their 
radical language. By applying to and attending an Ivy 
League university, they have already sought out a very 
traditional measure of success. But they said they all still 
feel that they are outside the structures of privilege that 
govern the art world.  “What we look like and who we 
are is very much not the norm in the art world or who 
runs any organization,” they said. Ofosu came to Yale 
intending to major in classics. She found it difficult that 
her coursework was dominated by the traditional white 
male canon, and that her perspective as a black woman 
was not represented. Coming up against what she 
described as Yale’s “traditional, old boys’ club” taught 
her that she does not align with that aspect of Yale’s 
identity and reputation. At the same time, she says she 
wouldn’t be where she is now without her experience 
at the university. In fact, it seems unlikely that PAC 
would exist if the founders had not had access to Yale’s 
intellectual and institutional resources. Their place in 
New Haven’s art world is defined on some level by this 
privilege, and they hope to use it to create an alternative 
space for creation and expression. At an event called 
“Stew and Stencies” in October, the group of attendees 
was diverse: Yalies, curious passersby on the street, New 
Haven activists, homeless New Havenites, people who 
just wanted stew, and people who just wanted to make 
stencils. PAC passes out flyers in Fair Haven as well as 
downtown, and hopes to engage and empower members 
of multiple communities by giving them a space to make 
art and, ideally, change.

n October 13, “Hard Works” transferred from the 
DaSilva Gallery to the Afro-American Cultural 
Center at Yale. Before it closes on November 12, Skinner 
hopes that some of the art world insiders who did not 
make it to the DaSilva gallery will come to the show, 
perhaps drawn in by the Yale-centric location. “I’m really 
looking forward to being in institutions,” he said. But it 
is unclear what will come of the exhibition, and whether

it will draw the members of the Yale community that 
Skinner thinks it will. Over the summer, he sold his first 
three paintings to a private collector, and another during 
the “Hard Works” reception. But the income generated 
by those sales is not significant enough to allow him to 
leave his jobs, and he is still striving for wider recognition. 
According to Skinner, it is especially difficult 
to be an artist in New Haven. The city is much less 
cosmopolitan than New York and has fewer galleries and 
art institutions.	
But when I brought up this idea at 
Artspace, Culligan disagreed. “In some ways it seems 
like it’s easier to be an artist in New York, but there’s so 
much more competition,” he said. “You’re just a drop 
in the bucket, and New York’s a much bigger bucket.” 
Kauder said that New Haven’s location between Boston 
and New York makes it easier for Artspace to tap into 
the art networks in those cities and bring curators to 
events like Speed Networking, for which twelve of the 
art professionals came from other cities. 
After the “Speed/Networking/Live!” event, I 
looked up many of the artists who participated. Some 
of them had been showing in galleries and even small 
museums across the country for decades. They have 
fruitful careers, and yet most are unlikely to become 
household names.” The more I learned about Artspace 
and PAC, and about the different interpretations of 
recognition and success in the art world, the more I 
wondered whether Skinner was placing too much stock 
in a big break or the transformative powers of fame. 
Shortly after his birthday, Skinner told me, “I’m 
thirty five years old, and I can’t be a famous artist when 
I’m dead. I need that recognition now.” As thrilled as 
he is to be showing at Yale, he still says that he does 
not know what is going to happen next in his career. “I 
don’t know how to connect the dots. I don’t know where 
my break is going to come from.” Skinner’s background 
itself is not an impediment to fame, but his lack of 
access to important resources may be keeping him 
out of the inner circle. His big break may be realizing 
that the power of his voice need not be defined by the 
number of people who choose to hear him.
