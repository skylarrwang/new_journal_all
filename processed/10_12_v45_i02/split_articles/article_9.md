Outside the Lines
Waiting outside Never Ending Books at 810 State 
Street one Saturday afternoon, I saw how the store 
gained its local nickname, “Never Open Books.” Its 
red-screened door, I was told, hadn’t opened once all 
week. Owner Roger Uihlein does little to alleviate the 
mystery of the closed storefront. Press-shy, he cannot 
be contacted by phone. Aside from regularly scheduled 
live events, business hours follow Uihlein’s whims. “He 
likes to be elusive,” said Brad Jacobs, who runs the 
store’s open-mic concert series and whose cell phone is 
listed as Never Ending Books’ only means of contact. 
Just to speak with Uihlein, I sat on the pavement outside 
the store for four hours. 


Outside, just to the left of the door, a small built-in 
bookshelf sports an assortment of works. A handwritten 
sign in the opposite window reads: “All books, records, 
CD’s (etc.) are FREE. Please feel free to leave a donation 
(large or small)! With much appreciation, Never Ending 
Folk.”


Uihlein and his young son arrived to unlock the 
place around four p.m., and I entered. A single person 
could just barely pass through the labyrinth of towering 
shelves and stacks of crates and boxes near the storefront. 
The variety inside was even more pronounced than that 
of the small collection kept outside. Browsing, I found a 
copy of Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing alongside 
a thick book entitled Gem Elixirs and Vibrational Healing, 
Vol. 1.


Customers can take or leave whatever and however 
many books they want. “People come in and they assign 
a value to the book and donate what they want,” Uihlein 
said.


Never Ending Books started as a little bookstore 
called Books on State Street, Uihlein explained. He 
passed by often and would see a man sitting in a wicker 
chair among small, three-foot-tall bookcases. One day 
Uihlein entered the store and spoke with the man in the 
window–Frank Caso, the space’s owner. Caso told him 
that the business was failing and Uihlein decided to help 
out. He supplied more shelves left over from a carpentry 
job—he worked in carpentry at the time—and gathered 
a community to brainstorm and ultimately name Never 
Ending Books. 


New Haven has already seen a decline in 
independent books sales—Labyrinth closed last year 
and Atticus and Book Trader are sustained largely by 
their cafes. Without the publicity and local backing 
of nonprofit and book bank New Haven Reads, the 
crowd drawn to Never Ending Books is necessarily self-
selecting. It remains even more of a wonder that Never 
Ending Books has maintained business. By encouraging 
the physical experience of reading, Uihlein said he aims 
to support the cause of the entire book industry. 


The financial operation of the space remains 
shrouded in as much mystery, if not more, as the 
store’s hours. A donation jar on the countertop of the 
kitchenette in the back contains some crumpled bills 
and a great deal of change. Behind this, out of sight, are 
some offices, such as those of the Rainbow Recycling 
Company, one of the main financial contributors to 
Never Ending Books. Uihlein is not willing to divulge 
much about how he has kept his store running for the 
dissipation of that mode of thinking.


Over the past hundred years, artifacts have come to 
be viewed as both national and international patrimony. 
Right now, the Machu Picchu collection can leave Peru 
for no more than two years at a time for circulating 
exhibitions. Peru recognizes the educational significance 
of these objects, and that they should be made available 
to as wide an audience around the world as possible. But 
it would seem that the key to successful collaboration 
is the understanding that the artifacts should always be 
able to go back home.


Earlier this month, Prieto helped pack up the final 
set of the Machu Picchu artifacts for shipment back 
to Peru. They will soon make a journey that Prieto 
has made countless times, bridging a gap between two 
hemispheres.
