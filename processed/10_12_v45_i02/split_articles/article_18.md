not often represented in popular contemporary art. “I 
want to be a voice for the people,” he said. 

If the party also seemed like a prequel, it was 
because Skinner did not yet feel like he had been able 
to share that voice. He wanted more recognition from 
what he called the “elitist” and “pretentious” art world. 
He wanted to start selling his paintings so that he could 
quit his jobs and paint full time. He wanted, someday, to 
move from New Haven to New York, where there are 
more artists and arts-related events. 

A week later, I sat with Skinner outside the Brooklyn 
Museum, talking about an exhibit we had just seen by 
famed visual artist Keith Haring. Skinner told me that he 
hoped to someday have his work displayed in a museum. 
Before that, though, he just wanted to be able to paint 
on his own terms. “I’ve worked for people all my life,” 
he said. “This is my time.” 

When I met Skinner last spring, I knew nothing 
about the process of becoming a professional artist. 
The art world was more of a mystery to me than it was 
to him. Even after speaking to artists, collectors, gallery 
owners, and a Yale History of Art professor, I did not 
understand what qualities distinguished art shown in 
expensive Chelsea galleries from art that was never seen. 

In the process of exploring these questions, I 
found two different spaces in New Haven that try to 
break down these barriers in the art world. Artspace, 
a New Haven nonprofit, gives artists strategies to get 
their work seen within a traditional gallery framework, 
as well as exhibition opportunities in both conventional 
and unconventional spaces. People’s Arts Collective, a 
newly founded organization trying to break down the 
art world’s economic and racial boundaries, aims not to 
operate within traditional frameworks at all. I realized 
that while access to more resources might make it easier 
for an artist to reach a broad audience, some artists 
choose to define their own success instead of allowing it 
to be dictated by a standard measure of popularity. 

Artspace was founded in 1984 by a group of 
local artists seeking more opportunities to share their 
work with the public. It regularly hosts exhibitions in 
its gallery space on Orange Street and also helps artists 
get seen in other venues. This October, Artspace kicked 
off the fifteenth annual iteration of City-Wide Open 
Studios, which allows nearly three hundred artists in the 
area to share their work with the public–far more than 
could be featured in New Haven’s galleries in a year. 

The non-profit’s Executive Director Helen Kauder said 
CWOS “is a very democratic, inclusive event.” Anyone 
who defined him or herself as a visual artist was invited 
to participate, just as anyone can become an Artspace 
member. Over the course of the first three weekends 
of this October, CWOS will be bringing visitors to 
artists’ private studios in New Haven, North Haven, and 
Hamden, to the group of studios in a former factory in 
Erector Square, and to site-specific art installations in 
the New Haven Register building.

Because there are only four commercial galleries, 
three co-op galleries and three non-profit galleries in 
New Haven and only a handful more in the surrounding 
region, according to Cynthia Clair, the Executive 
Director of the Arts Council of New Haven, getting 
art into them often proves difficult. Skinner spent two 
years driving to galleries in New Haven, Bridgeport, 
Westport, and Stamford, a painting or two sitting in his 
trunk, hoping to convince them to display his work. For 
years, he had little success. 

On the last Sunday in September, twenty-three 
curators, gallery directors, and art scholars– the kind of 
professionals Skinner needs to impress to get his work 
seen–gathered at Artspace for “Speed/Networking/
Live!” Artists had three minutes 
to explain their work to the 
professionals, who responded 
with two minutes of feedback. 
“There are many occasions when 
an artist might meet a collector, a 
curator, or someone who works at 
a museum, and the artist doesn’t 
have his or her work there, 
but has an opportunity to say 
something,” Kauder said. “The 
question is, how does an artist 
put his or her best foot forward?” 

The event was an opportunity 
for artists to try up to twenty-
three ways of talking about their 
work in the most compelling way. 
Daniel Belasco, a New York-
based freelance curator who 
participated in the networking 
event both this year and last year, said, “[Artists] could 
practice their pitch in the shower. What’s most important 
is to get feedback.”

As Kauder prepped the professionals inside, JP 
Culligan, an artist and an Artspace employee, stood 
outside and asked the arriving artists to wait on the street 
until the event’s one p.m. start time. Culligan grew up 
in New Haven and graduated from the Hartford Art 
School with a degree in printmaking. He told me that 
because a lot of art internships, jobs, and exhibitions 
require resumes and artist statements, he values the 
opportunity to meet these professionals face-to-face. “I 
tend to do better with these things when I actually get to 
talk to people,” he said. Bryant Davis brought printouts 
of his digital art, which he calls “homoceptual blending” 
and which involves breaking down JPEG files. He 
agreed with Culligan. “It’s nice to actually get to meet 
somebody and talk to them,” he said. Like Culligan, 
Davis formally studied art, graduating from The New 
School’s Parsons School of Design.

Skinner, on the other hand, did not go to art school 
or college, and he didn’t know that Artspace hosted 
networking events in addition to being a gallery space. 
On September 20th, when his second solo show, “Hard 
Works,” opened at the DaSilva Gallery in New Haven’s 
Westville neighborhood, the reception was primarily 
attended by his friends, family, and previous supporters. 
He is frustrated by the difficulties in getting the other 
people he wants to see his paintings– including those 
who run art foundations, contemporary art museums, 
and large commercial galleries–to attend a show at a small 
gallery in Westville. “The biggest problem,” he said, “is 
the disconnect between myself 
and the movers and shakers in 
the art world.” His agent Albert 
agrees that getting art into 
galleries is difficult, “especially if 
you don’t have a resume already, 
if you haven’t shown at such and 
such galleries or graduated from 
such and such schools.” Albert, 
a cinematographer and self-
described “marketing consultant,” 
met Skinner at the Fernando Luis 
Alvarez Gallery in Stamford while 
Albert was filming a reception. 
The two men became friends, and 
Albert subsequently made a short 
documentary about Skinner. Like 
Skinner, Albert is an outsider in 
the art world, despite having some 
experience in the film industry.  

While Skinner may resent his separation from the 
more traditional art world, his position as an outsider 
also shapes his art. The poster for “Hard Works” was 
designed to mimic a timesheet, a reference to Skinner’s 
working class background and the eighty hours a week 
he works as an aide to developmentally disabled adults. 
Some of his paintings, like “Crack Baby” and “Jesus 
Piece” explicitly reference the poverty, drugs, and 
diseases he encountered during his childhood. 

Sometimes Skinner worries that gallery owners 
“want to see me in a cardboard box, living under my 
paintings or some shit,” so that they can swoop in and 
save him, and that his art isn’t as appealing to them once 
they find out that his personal narrative isn’t quite that 
dramatic. Trying to gain their approval, and crafting a 
compelling story to draw them in, frustrates Skinner on 
principle, but he believes that it is necessary. Seeking 
validation “can go against everything you stand for in

your work, but you kind of need that,” he said. 

Not everyone agrees that validation from the 
traditional art world is necessary for success. Kenneth 
Reveiz ’12, one of the founders of the People’s Arts 
Collective, said that “a lot of art spaces can be really 
alienating, whether it’s because people don’t have the 
money or because it’s not part of their culture or habit 
to go to galleries.” According to its website, PAC is a 
“group of artists and activists collaborating to address 
social, racial, economic, environmental and human 
injustices in New Haven.” Reveiz and his cofounders, 
Diana Ofosu ’12 and Gabriel DeLeon ’14, want to use 
art-based interventions to address these injustices.

PAC rents two formerly dilapidated storefronts 
on College Street for $250 a month. All of their events 
and services, which include a take-what-you-like pile 
of clothing and books and classes taught by members 
of the New Haven community, are free. During PAC’s 
weekday open hours, anyone is welcome to come in and 
create art–or just hang out.

When I visited PAC to speak with its founders, I 
did not understand their specific goals; I knew nothing 
beyond the mission statement. They told me that 
art-based interventions are highly aesthetic, mostly 
performative actions that create some change in the 
world. One tactile example of a solvable problem, Ofosu
