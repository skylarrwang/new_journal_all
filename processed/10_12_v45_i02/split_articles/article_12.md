Eva Song’s one-bedroom apartment, on the sixth 
floor of Taft Apartments at 265 College St., 
is cluttered. A tall black loft bed stands in the 
center, surrounded by various objects: a painting of a 
Venetian mask hangs to the floor with cardboard boxes 
full of rolled-up artwork underneath; a bookshelf on 
the other side of the room holds The Official Guide to 
the GRE, Frida Kahlo: Song of Herself, and manuals 
for Adobe Illustrator and InDesign; two coffee tables, 
both from Ikea, face each other at awkward angles. 
	

On the floor, Song has set up an air mattress 
for the strangers she regularly invites to pass through 
her apartment, when she temporarily pushes the bean 
bags and other colorful debris to the side. As I talk to 
Song in her room, I imagine her toiling on an art project 
while the stomach of an unfamiliar traveler rises and 
falls heavily across the room.
	

Song is a member of Couch Surfing, an online 
network through which travelers can contact locals for 
a place to stay and find people who will offer them a 
mattress to stay on, and possibly food, a tour, a party, or 
advice. Since she joined the network two summers ago, 
she has hosted and met students and travelers from all 
over the world. 
	

A small but vibrant community of New Haven 
Couch Surfers exists within and beyond Yale. Couch 
Surfing allows Song — and the few other Yale students 
involved— an escape from what she describes as a 
culture of single-mindedness at the university. For these 
students, inviting strangers into their homes is a way 


to connect with a network of travelers who envision a 
more interwoven, understanding world.
	

Song, an art and political science double major, 
is from Chengdu, China. Originally enrolled in the class 
of 2013, she took a gap year after a freshman year filled 
with confusion and self-doubt. “Before college I just 
knew I was going to go to America, that was the plan,” 
she tells me, while sitting in a pile of art supplies and 
cosmetics on her floor, “but when I came here I didn’t 
really have a goal anymore, a plan.” 
 She needed, urgently, to get away. In her year off she, 
among other things, worked at a radio show in Uganda, 
volunteered at a school outside Beijing, took a diving 
course in Australia, and travelled through Europe. 
Going away gave Song perspective, and after a year she 
was ready to return.
	

When Song came back to Yale for her 
sophomore year, she lived on campus in Pierson 
College. The following summer, she made a permanent 
move to her current apartment and began hosting 
foreigners passing through the city. Bringing in people 
with outside perspectives, like those she had observed 
while travelling, helped Song accustom to being at Yale 
once more. Couch Surfing has provided her an escape 
from the goal-oriented attitude that can pervade life at 
Yale. “People tend to get similar if they stick together 
for too long,” she explained.
	

Couch Surfing purports to be “a global network 
of travelers, adventure seekers and lifelong learners” 
valuing diversity, openness, and sharing. Based in San 
Francisco, the Couch Surfing project was conceived by 
Casey Fenton in 1999. Fenton came up with the idea 
after, finding an inexpensive flight from Boston to 
Iceland, he e-mailed 1,500 students from the University 
of Iceland asking for a place to stay, and received more 
than 50 offers. Couchsurfing.com went public in January 
2004; eight years later, the site has 5.2 million members 
and is the most popular free accommodation site on the 
web. The United States has the most Couch Surfers in 
the world, followed by Germany, France, England and
