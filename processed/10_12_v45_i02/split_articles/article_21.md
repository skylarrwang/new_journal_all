neath Clapp’s boots, the Ayesha’s rain-soaked teak deck, 
rich and dark, gleaming as though cast in lamplight, 
seems no better evidence.

Some say a wooden boat’s beauty comes from 
nature, just as the boats themselves do—that wooden 
boats, in reflecting the grain of trees, the wings of birds, 
evoke a visceral need to connect to the natural world. 
Lawrence Cheek, author of The Year of  the Boat, connects 
their beauty to biophilia, an innate tendency born of in­
stincts of survival and reproduction to “focus on life 
and lifelike processes.”  We can see the strong, fanning 
branches of the oak in a sailboat’s hull; the long, elegant 
arms of the cedar in its bowed planks; the buttressed 
roots of the mahogany in the boat’s lustrous brightwork.

The beauty of a wooden boat is also reflected in 
its craftsmanship. It is not manufactured, like fiberglass 
boats; it is built, by hand.  There is something beautiful 
about the sight of a Dutch Wharf employee sitting in 
the shadow of a 38’ sloop and lovingly sanding its tiny 
nameplate. A wooden boat does not just have a person­
ality within it.  It has a person behind it, a person with 
the skill to bend and shape wood and make dull things 
gleam. 

For Clapp, who spends much of the year perform­
ing repairs, part of a wooden boat’s beauty is its con­
struction. “A wooden boat is made of pieces,” he tells 
me frequently. The keel, the stem, the stern, the strake; if 
one of these becomes worn or aged, it can simply be re­
placed.  This is why a wooden boat lasts. Even after years 
of neglect and disrepair, a wooden boat can be put back 
together again, and Bill Clapp can do it. Fiberglass devel­
ops spots and stress cracks, but the beauty of a wooden 
boat, when it’s maintained, only increases with age.

“It’s simply elegant,” Clapp tells me of the Ayesha. 
“Its beauty comes from the craftsmanship, but also from 
being unchanged.” 

Clapp’s apprentice, Mitch, once told me the same 
thing about Clapp.  “Bill comes from another time,” he 
said. “He devotes everything to this. He’s single-minded. 
He’s not a modern guy. Everything everywhere is con­
stantly changing, but not Bill.” 


I 
am sixteen. Even after two years, my grandpa’s big brick house 
feels empty—of  purple, of  pretzels, of  giddy races down the 
front staircase. In the den, as always, sits a big model boat, its 
brass sails tarnished from age. Above the television is a framed 
photo of  Grandpa and Grammie on the deck of  the Squidulum, 
the lake glittering blue behind them. 

“I’ve been going to Lake Rathbun,” Grandpa tells me 
proudly, when he sees me staring at the picture. He spends time at 
the yacht club and sails on the mile-wide lake with his more agile 
friends. “It makes me feel young again,” he likes to say.

To me it feels like a betrayal.

hen I leave the Ayesha’s cabin, the rain is falling 
even harder, gusting in my face like sea spray. The

cube-shaped boatlift has been returned to its place, now 
straddling the slip on its four angular metal legs. After 
the lift’s slings have been lowered into the water, the 
boat—a small racing craft—is driven above them, and 
the slings are repositioned snugly around its hull. 

Clapp grins at me from the docks. “You can sit in 
the crane!” he calls through the downpour, gesturing to 
an old blue machine that is used to unstep—remove—
sailboats’ masts. “We’re just about to start.” 

The rain is inescapable, even in the shelter of the 
crane’s cab. It sheets through the open door and drips 
from the cracks in the ceiling. As I have taken to doing 
for the past few weeks, I pull out my notebook and be­
gin to scribble on the damp pages.  If my eyes wander, 
they go to the sailboats’ forebidding masts, their uneven 
decks. It’s better that they don’t.   

“Put down your notepad,” Clapp is used to telling 
me. “Look at this.” 

I look up to see Clapp standing at the door of the 
crane, the corner of his mouth open in a slightly sheep­
ish smile. Beneath the brim of his rubber hood, his an­
gular cheeks are flushed and ruddy from the cold; his 
crooked nose, mottled with a network of dark red veins, 
pokes out. After the boat has been lifted, he explains to 
me, it will be scrubbed, its barnacles scraped away, and 
sprayed with a pressure washing hose. “You could prob­
ably write a whole paper just about pressure washing,” 
he finishes, eagerly. 

Thunder growls in the distance.

“Come on up with me. I want to show you how it 
feels to lift one of these,” he says. 

Before I fully realize it, I am up on the platform 
of the boatlift, the soggy remains of my notebook still 
sitting in the crane. Clapp climbs up after me. Here, the 
wind cuts against us, and my jeans are soon soaked to 
the skin. 

While Clapp monitors the work on the deck of the 
boat below us, explaining to me the intricacies of the 
slings’ placement on the hull, I turn to stare out at the 
river. I know I’m imagining it, but the sky seems a little 
lower up here, pulled closer to the water and the reeds. 
The boats look smaller. Where the flat, low river turns 
away from us, their masts barely scrape against the ho­
rizon. 

“You ready to lift this?” Clapp asks me. He is still 
grinning, almost impishly. 

“Okay.” 

He puts my palm on one of the levers, and then his 
own gloved hand on top of mine. “You’ve got to go real 
slowly,” he says. 

Together, we pull the lever, and the boat begins to 
rise, rise until it is out of the water, until it hangs in front 
of us, suspended in midair, its keel exposed. 


am ten. My grandpa is determined to teach me, his oldest grand­
daughter, to sail, so he builds me a wooden boat in the backyard 
of  his Iowa home. In the single picture that exists of  it, the Molly 
Rose, a ten-foot catboat still without its mast, looks almost like a 
toy, child-sized and slick with new varnish. 

	
We’ll go out on the lake in the boat together, Grandpa 
promises, and he’ll show me how to work the rigging, and how to 
steer. When he mentions it, I say nothing. I don’t want to set foot 
in his boat, even if  it was made for me.

That summer, Grandpa is driving the boat to me for the 
first time when a man rear-ends him on the highway. Before it ever 
touches the water, the Molly Rose splinters apart.


F
our days later, Clapp and I go sailing. For me, it is the 
first time in sixteen years. For Clapp, it is the last sail 
of the season, the end of a summer’s worth of cruises.

	
The day is, like so many on the Connecticut 
coast, gray and still. The cove where Clapp moors the 
Vertue is lined with yellow-gray slabs of granite that 
seemingly slough off the banks into the water. Trees, 
and the umber shell of a long-defunct fishworks, pro­
trude like a spine from the granite island. We float into 
the cove in a dinghy that Clapp keeps tied in the shallows. 
Clapp rows, and I sit hunched in the bow, narrowing my 
eyes at the sailboat ahead of us and feeling my throat 
tighten with every stroke. A hundred or so feet away, the 
Vertue sits elegantly on the water. Its hull, made from 
solid teak, is a simple white with a green stripe at the 
water line, and its wooden bow curves slightly upwards. 
The mainmast, against the frame of the fishworks, looks 
like the needle-thin spire of a country church.

I told Clapp about my fear of sailing on the day we 
first met, almost a month ago. A the time, he only nod­
ded, and neither of us have brought it up since. Alone 
together in the dinghy, with only the faint sound of a 
motor puttering in the distance, I find myself wondering 
if he remembers.

As I climb onto the Vertue for the first time, Clapp 
offers me his hand, and I take it, knowing I could easily 
step on without him. He grips my hand tightly even after 
I am standing on the deck. 

When he lets go, I feel the motion of the boat 
worming into my stomach. The sail is still bundled away 
in a sail cover, but the bare mast looms uneasily above 
us.  

At first there is too little wind to sail, so we use 
the Vertue’s motor, a slow noisy thing that Clapp says he 
would “rather do without.” While we sit together in the 
cockpit, holding watery mugs of coffee, Clapp tells me 
stories of Branford Bay. Thoughts of my grandmother 


crackle like static over Clapp’s voice and the scenery 
around us. It’s impossible to listen to more than a few 
words before he, and the boat and the bay, are blurred 
out. 

Then the wind picks up, and Clapp switches off 
the motor. The silence is uneasy, cut by the occasional 
smack of a shallow wave against the hull. “Are you all 
right steering while I put up the sails?” he asks.

I nod, wordlessly, and take the tiller. The sail snaps 
in the first gust of wind, and suddenly I can feel the boat 
picking up speed beneath me, as though we are being 
lifted, shedding weight. 

“See, now the luff is tight,” Clapp says, tying the 
rope to a cleat. “Now we can start sailing.”   

Clapp returns to the cock­
pit, but he doesn’t take back the 
tiller. Instead, he sits next to me 
and explains the positions of the 
sails, the meaning of tacking and 
heeling and gybing. Sailing re­
quires focus, he tells me. Watch 
the waves, to see if they change; 
watch the white sails above you, 
to see if they Clappow and shift; 
watch the swinging jib, the heel­
ing hull. Feel the wind, smell the 
salt. 

Then the seam of clouds 
splits apart and thick, angular rays 
of sunlight fall on Branford Bay. The trees burst into 
flame, maroon and orange, and the steely water is swept 
with a rim of cerulean. The breeze flares and the sail 
cracks and fills and I can feel the tiller straining against 
my hand, and us, the boat and Clapp and I, caught up 
in the wind. The hull slices through the water, accompa­
nied by the deep groan of the mast in its step.

“There you go,” Clapp says. “Now you’ve got it.” 

He is perched on the edge of the cockpit, just beneath 
the boom, worn baseball cap blown back to reveal 
traces of stubbly gray hair. “The breeze is picking up, 
see? We’re going to tack.” He points ahead to where the 
waves are beginning to stir, to where the blue is tipped 
with glittering gold, and he takes the smooth wood of 
the tiller. We steady. 

I feel, in that gilded, breathless moment, a swell of 
grief. I look not at the boat but at the hand next to mine, 
calloused and rutted, guiding the tiller.

I’m thinking about a day last week when Clapp was 
trying to explain to me the beauty of wooden boats. At 
first, he tried to describe the experience of sailing Tern. 
Then he trailed off and began again with a story about 
his five-year-old grandson—they go sailing together in 
the summer, often for hours at a time. Clapp told me 
they had been meaning to go on a cruise yesterday, but 
his grandson was grounded; it was so late in October 
that the cruise would have to wait until next year. Next 
year, when Clapp will really teach him how to sail.

It’s only now, holding the tiller, listening to Bill 
Clapp explain how to catch the wind, that I understand 
what his grandson has to do with the beauty of a wood­
en boat. 


am 20. 

I call Grandpa after Clapp drops me off  in New Haven 
that afternoon. I tell him, not entirely untruthfully, that I liked 
sailing. I tell him about Clapp’s thick sturdy boat, gliding slowly 
through the Bay, and about how I took 
the tiller and held the jib sheet. I use the 
words Clapp has taught me, straining to 
remember the vocabulary that comes to 
him with such fluency. It is the longest 
conversation we have had since Gram­
mie stopped chiming in from the phone 
in the upstairs bedroom. 

“Did you get to the lake at all this 
year?” I ask. “To sail?” 

“Not this year,” he says. “I’m 
not walking so good nowadays. I can’t 
stand on a deck that’s pitching back and 
forth.” 

He’ll be 88 next year, and it’s the 
third summer in a row that he hasn’t been able to sail. While 
we talk, Grandpa cycles nostalgically through his own line of  
wooden boats: the Kevelle, the Squidulum, the Capella, the 
never-sailed Molly Rose... After that he trails off. Neither of  us 
mentions the last boat, though we are both thinking of  her. 

But I am thinking, too, of  Bill Clapp and his grandson. The 
grief  I felt on the sailboat today was not for my grandmother, but 
for the man whose hand should have been next to mine on the tiller. 
Now I have to think that it never will be. 

“I thought about you a lot today,” I tell my grandfather. “I 
miss you.”

“I’ve been missing you too, granddaughter,” he says. Then his 
voice grows low, strangled. “Maybe next year we can sail together.” 

Even after years of  
neglect and disrepair, a 
wooden boat can be put 
back together again, and 
Clapp can do it.
