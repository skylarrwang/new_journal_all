You are not good
at lying in wait
by slits in wooden hides
or crawling on your stomach
through moorland
to peer over cliffs
for a single, shimmering egg.
The specialists,
with their brimmed hats
and new binoculars,
their careful speech
and mind for populations --
“200, 000 off these cliffs, alone” –
delight you:
they talk of specimens 
and graphs,
their print marches birdlike
over lined pages.
Still, in these open places,
you always find yourself
wandering off
through common scurveygrass
and kidneyvetch,
past the delicate balloons
of sea campion
and the yellow tongue
of bird’s foot trefoil
speaking the names
of the unseen:
curlew, razorbill, skua,
wheatear, kittiwake --
this incantation of nothing
or wings.


**Couch Surfing: An Intimate Experience**

met up with Song a few times in New Haven and the 
two travelled together to visit Boston. John said taking a 
trip with a stranger “was sort of a leap of faith I guess, 
but it made the whole experience less lonely, more 
interesting.”


The intimacy that results from Couch Surfing 
is singular. “There’s an immediacy to the relationships 
formed through Couch Surfing,” said Hans Schoenburg 
’10, who has been hosting since his senior year at Yale, 
when he lived at 216 Dwight. “It’s not like ‘break the 
ice,’ it’s ‘go straight to the heart.” He still regularly hosts 
travelers in his New Haven home.


Song sometimes feels awkward around her 
Surfers when she first meets them, but that discomfort 
soon wears off. The intensity of Couch Surfing 
relationships is exciting to her. “People can be interesting 
in little bits—you get little tastes of people,” she said. 
She has had conversations with her Surfers about her 
problems, her relationships, her anxieties, ones that she 
wouldn’t have with her closest friends. 


Clément Casse, a student from France studying 
for a master’s in economics, stayed with Song for ten 
days last summer, and they took a spontaneous trip to 
Niagara Falls together. Couch Surfers often act at the 
spur of the moment, milking the personal connections 
they make. The interactions mirror Rifkin’s vision of a 
tighter-knit planet made up of transitory relationships 
between strangers.


The current residents of 216 Dwight — six juniors 
who moved in this fall — have not hosted any 
Surfers yet. They plan to have a house meeting to 
discuss the possibility at the end of this semester, after 
they get used to living together. Sebastian Monzon ’14 
said he is excited at the prospect of meeting new people 
from interesting places. He likes the idea of the network, 
of bringing people together and sharing stories, but he 
is also a little tentative about the responsibility hosting 
entails. 


Although technically he is bringing visitors into 
the Yale bubble by hosting Couch Surfers, Jackson said 
his experiences also help him step outside of the stress 
and pressure that comes with being an undergraduate at 
the university.


Once he hosted a man from southwest China 
who was “giddy” to be touring Yale’s campus. Jackson 
returned to his room one night, overloaded with 
homework and activities, and vented about it to his 
new housemate. He said the man ordered him to stop 
working and to have tea with him instead, snapping him 
out of his anger and giving him a better perspective on 
his situation. 


Song also indicated that part of Couch Surfing 
is almost therapeutic. Going away for a year balanced 
her, gave her perspective, prepared her to return to 
college. By bringing strangers into her home, she keeps 
her hand outstretched to the world that brought her in.
