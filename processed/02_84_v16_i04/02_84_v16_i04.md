The POR Feuds 
To the Editor: 
I suppose the appetite of your readers 
for rehashing old POR feuds is limited. 
I know mine is. But while we're on the 
subject, let the record show that Wen-
dell Bird's 
1976 "purge" of thirty 
members was illegal and void, and that 
Bird was duly censured, impeached and 
removed from office within a week. As 
for musical bedrooms and all those other 
lurid goodies, most of Bird's charges 
were exaggerated, and the rest were 
nonsense- no Party member, in my 
four years at Yale, sang Nazi songs. 
The Party has its share of turkeys and 
flakes, ·maybe more than its share. But 
through it, I made dear friends, en-
countered new ideas and lost some 
eminently losable illusions. What more 
can a student group give? I look for-
ward to attending the Banquet this 
winter. 
Sincerely, 
Richard Brookhiser 
Editor, National Review 
Sometime Chairman


No Animosity 
As the Chairman and Secretary of the 
Tory Party of the Yale Political Union, 
we read with great interest the recent 
article concerning the Party of the 
Right (TNJ, December 9, 1983). We 
must strongly protest, however, the 
reference to the Tory Party as "the 
POR's bitter enemy in the Political 
Union." Although we sometimes 
disagree with the Party of the Right 
about matters of Political Union policy, 
we fully recognize that it meets the 
needs of an important constituency at 
Yale. Since the purpose of the Tory Par-
ty is to provide a forum for political 
i:liscussion, no possible reason exists for 
animosity between it and any other par-
ty in the Political"Union. Suggestions of 
bitterness between the two groups can 
only help create the. situation they 
describe. 
Very truly yours, 
Walter C. Wagner, Chairman 
Alan D. Viard, Secretary


A Biased Approach 
To the Ed.itor: 
As a former editor of The New journal, I 
was thoroughly disheartened, while 
reading Anne Applebaum's article on 
the Unification Church in New Haven 
(TN}, December 9, 1983), to see the 
amount of non-professionalism that 
your publication now deems acceptable. 
Miss Applebaum's piece was predicated 
throughout on the assumption that 
Moon's followers are ridiculous and not 
worthy of serious consideration. In fact, 
the very title of the article reveals its 
slant: it u$es the term 'Moonies', an ap-
pellation considered derogatory to 
members of the Unification Church. 
Would you be willing to print an article 
about New Haven's J~wish community 
entitled "Yids at Yale"? 
To cite only one other egregious in-
stance of Miss Applebaum's biased ap-
proach, she periodically characterizes 
the Moon followers she interviewed as 
being "very pleased to meet you." Her 
snide repetition of the phrase is ob-
viously meant to evoke the popular im-
age of Unification Church members as 
bland, mindless automatons. While I 


have no more love for the Reverend 
Moon than anyone else, I do not think 
it fair for his organization to be 
publically examined by an observer 
who has no concept of impartiality. The 
Ntw Journal must learn to distinguish 
between true investigation and a super-
cilious gawking at others from a posi-
tion of presumed superiority.

The Hollywood Connection 
Your article on the Yale connection to 
"'War Games" ( TNJ, September 9, 
1983) only told part of the story. Direc-
tor John Badham went to Yale, but so 
did the writers who created the whole 
idea and perservered through several 
years 
of endless 
Hollywood 
"yes-and-no's"- Laurence Lasker and 
Walter Parkes. 
The omission deserves special correc-
tion in this publication, as Larry Lasker 
wrote memorably for The New J ournal 
in its first year of existence, and was 
subsequently its editor. So there is life 
after Yale.

OriginaUy, this was going to be a stu-
dent manifesto. It was going to say that 
Yal~ doesn't give a damn about its 
students anymore. It was going to talk 
about how this university is losing its 
soul and the spark of youth. Yes, my 
manifesto was going to talk about the 
joy of being a colle&e kid, the joy of te-
quila shots and the Saybrook Strippers 
on cold November Saturdays, and 
road trips to Long Island and frisbee 
on President Giamatti's lawn at three 
in the morning. It was going to be 
about the perfect oddity of24 glasses of 
flat beer lined up on Cross Campus on 
a spring day, the kidnapping of the 
Ezra Stiles moose, the colored armies 
on Bladderball afternoons, or the mid-
night my freshman year when 5,000 
Yale students emerged from their win-
dows during exam week in a staged 
event known as the Communal Groan, 
yeUing, "I'm mad as hell and I'm not 
going to take it anymore!" 
Yale, my manifesto would have said, 
is suffocating us, turning us into old 
people before our time. We were 
forfeiting our bright college years, 
refusing them, postponing them, and 
here we were peeping into microscopes 
and turning rhymes and forgetting 
how to laugh in our race to adulthood. 
We were succumbmg to the fretful 
preprofessionalism of our time, the 
academic pressure and the conser-
vative career worry that Yale fans in 
our faces. And now we the Young Peo-
ple were taking the punches, not 
delivering them, 
like middle-aged 
prizefighters stumbling against the 
ropes. 
Ironically, what prevented me from 
writing the manifesto was my own self-
consciousness about sounding young. 
It seemed a juvenile thing to do, draw-
ing battle lines in a place so nearly 
perfect as Yale. It was then that I 
reaJized.the truth, that the adversary of 
our youth is not Yale, but ourselves. 
At Yale we accelerate the process of 
growing up. Our lust for maturity has 
much to do with an image so many of 
us have of ourselves, the image of a 
sophisticated ctttzen, politicized, 
cultured, full of arguments, adroit with 
the Sunday Times. We rush to be that 
citizen. So we do not occupy ourselves 
in the same way that students at most 
universities do. We do not join frater-
nities or sororities; rather, we join The 
Prisoner Film Society and the Coali-
tion Against Apartheid. Yale is our 
grounding in matured elitism, where 
we learn to make lunchdates. Perhaps

**Title: A Case for Quarantine?**
**Author: W Hampton Sides**
**Page number(s): 8-9**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The case of a New Haven prostitute whose one-year-old infant· is being treated for AIDS in a special ward at Yale-New Haven Hospital continues to perplex health officials and medical authorities alike. Since The New journal broke the story in December ("Lana: A Story of Scarlet Letters and Public Risks"), the legal and ethical dilemma posed by this I. V . drug-abusing AIDS carrier has received national attention. CBS News is now working on a 60 Minutes segment about the special AIDS case which should be aired later this month. 

Meanwhile, a state legislator in Hartford has proposed a piece of legislation- as a response to this case- that would empower health department officials to quarantine certain individuals who present a "deathly" threat to public health in Connecticut. 

Richard Tulisano (D-Rocky Hill), Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, believes the quarantine statutes now on the books must be altered to address the unique epidemiological problems which , he believes, AIDS has presented in certain instances like this one. "We need a way to protect the public," Tulisano .told TN]. "This woman has a communicable condition and may be infecting lots of people. She may be creating a major health hazard." 

Tulisano's new quarantine proposal is fashioned after the civil commitment statutes of Connecticut which enable authorities to detain certain individuals, usually mentally-disturbed patients, who present a clear and present danger to others and to themselves. He wants to add to the commitment criteria anyone who has a communicable disease and who "presents a clear mortal threat" to the community . "I'm concerned about the woman's rights," said Tulisano, "but I'm more concerned about the community's right to public health. My legislation will address isolated individuals. It's not aimed at homosexuals or any other group. I don't want it to be used as a tool . of oppression." 

While the legislators and civil liberties attorneys in Hartford ponder the legalities of quarantine, the woman continues to work on the streets to support herself and her $200-a-day heroin dependency. And as the health department; the police d~partment and the physicians all argue, there is very little that can be done about the situation without violating her rights. Yale Chaplain, John Vannorsdall may be the only person who has offered a way out of the impasse. With the assistance of Paul Keane, Vannorsdall has proposed to her that money could be raised through Yale channels to keep her off the streets, pay her rent and grocery bill and secure her a full-time counselor. He has also proposed that a special half-way house of sorts could be located to accommodate her and others who may be in a "similar predicament." But the woman appears to be unwilling to accept Vannorsdall's proposal. "We don't, indeed we can't, do anything without her participation," explained Vannorsdall. "The problem is one of not wanting to force something on her. We've tried very much to protect her rights, but we need her cooperation." 


**Title: Pin-up Blues**
**Author: Paul Hojheinz**
**Page number(s): 8**

When a calendar bearing provocative photographs of 12 Yale women appeared in 1982, many people were upset. The controversy even spilled over into the pages of the Yale Daily News when several of the models who had posed for the calendar wrote that their photographs had been misused. 
But the creators of the Daughters of Yale Calendar may have quietly gotten into even deeper trouble than this public dispute. A year and a half later, they still haven't paid most of their bills-which may amount to as much as $10,000 of outstanding debt on the now worthless 1983 calendar. The photographer, S.M. Cooper, whose work has appeared on the cover of Genesis albums, says he is still owed $400. Mary Ann Rumney of the prestigious graphic arts firm Rumney Schiffer which designed the .calendar, says she still has outstanding receipts for for "over $2000" of work. Bill Josline of Eastern Press, which printed over 10,000 copies of the full-color, glossy calendar, says Eastern has received only one third of the money it is due. Finally, the state of Delaware, where American Ivy, Inc. is incorporated to produce the calendar, says the company owes $49 in back taxes. 
When Douglas Becker '81 and Amy Rothman began producing a parody of pin-up calendars ·in 1981, they thought they had a sure bet. The idea was to depict models from Yale in various stereotypes ranging from punk to preppy. Becker. would handle the financial arrangements and Rothman would oversee the artistic and creative work. 
The calendar never sold very well. Most of the 10,000 copies were still in a warehouse last April when the distributor, Inland Books, received permission from Rothman to throw them out. David Wilks, who oversaw . the distribution for Inland, said that sales were ."poor," adding that few bookstores even bothered to select the calendar for sale from Inland's catalogue. 
Meanwhile, Becker has left the country, making it difficult for his creditors to work out a financial solution to their problem. Last January, he went to Israel for three weeks. He was in California for a while in the spring, but last September he was back in New Haven on his way to Europe where he is "wandering around," according to his father. He says he hears from his son occasionally, though he doesn't know when-or if- his son Doug will return to New Haven. 
Rothman has stayed in New Haven where she worked as a waitress for a while. When Becker was here in September, she sold her share of American Ivy to him and says she suspects he will dissolve the company when he returns to the United States.

it is a good thing, this attitude we 
develop at Yale, but what happens to 
our youth in the process? 
Ah, how important it is to be young. 
How important it is to deposit a certain 
amount of shaving cream in an inconvenient place, at least once, and to 
assassinate each other with rubber 
darts. How indispensible it was, my 
sophomore year, when we plotted an 
elaborate scheme to steal the bladder-
ball from Phelps Gate, with steel cable, 
pulleys and a getaway car. Or, the 
time four years ago when a group of 
my friends broke into Sterling Library 
late one night and turned on a few 
dozen strategically-located lights in the 
windows of the stacks. They spelled an 
incandescent four-letter word over 
York Street, photographed this magnificent expletive, and gave the picture to 
our dean as a birthday present. How 
utterly vital it is to do these things, if 
for no other reason that because there 
is no reason at all. It is our youth striking back. 
It ts often forgotten that Yale 
students are also human beings and 
that they have tbeir own.growing up to 
contend with somewhere in between 
James Joyce and freshman chemistry. 
I think the pressure we heap upon 
ourselves to be adults during the week 
pushes us to extremes on the weekend. 
It makes us compress our immaturity 
into a limited time frame. 
Which brings me to the question of 
student violence. There has been much 
talk recently about the subject, thanks 
largely to a new group known as Yale 
Students Against Violence by Yalies. 
The group has come forward to denounce the intolerable number of 
violent deeds perpetrated by Yale 
students. Though the group seems to 
focus a disproportionate amount of attention on shaving cream and fire extinguishers and other petty white 
crimes, it has raised a serious issue. 
Any of us who have ever seen a gutted 
entryway on the morning after or who 
have known someone who has been 
raped must feel the same revulsion and 
infuriation that this group feels. 
But something puzzles me about this 
group's rhetoric. It is, I think, the 
assumption that Yale, unlike other collections of human beings, should 
somehow enjoy immunity from the 
cruder elements of human nature. "We 
offer you an opportunity," their 
literature reads, "to join in the creation 
of a community in which these occurrences are not tolerated." Co-founder 
Ken Dauber echoes this view in the 
YDN: "We hope to create a new culture 
where people who are violent will be 
embarrassed and others are repulsed 
by their violence. We want to change . 
the culture. When people are rowdy 
and others cannot study, 
that's 
violence ... We're not concerned with 
the degree of violence; we just want to 
stop it." 
How dangerously arrogant it is to 
think that Yale should be a perfect 
place, a place where things don't have 
to be "tolerated." What a terrifying 
denial of reality to think that going to 
any unversity for four years could cure 
people of their own nature. What 
puzzles me is that anyone should be 
surprised that Yale students behave 
like other students sometimes do, that 
they sometimes collapse into rage, irrationality, immaturity or meanness. 
This is a subtle form of elitism that I 
am afraid most of us share to some extent: the idea that Yalies make better 
neighbors, fuller humans, and that 
Yale is, or should be, a utopian community. It is reinforced every year 
when the President of Yale presents 
this lofty arrogance in some packaged 
form to the freshman class. "If at Yale 
you can experience the joy that the acquisition and creation of knowledge for 
its own sake brings," wrote President 
Giamatti last September, "the adventure will last your whole life and you 
will have discovered the distinction between living as a full human being and 
merely existing." 
What worries me about Yale Students Against Violence by Yalies, as 
much as I applaud their efforts, is that 
our crusade against "rowdiness" may 
be a sign that we have bought the 
rhetoric from on high. We should 
never let anyone convince us that we 
are a protected class, sliced from the 
inferior bulk of humanity, and thrown 
into an academic village where we are 
obligated to grow up overnight. 
That is what my manifesto would 
have said, anyway.

**Title: Tang Runs Dry**
**Author: Christina Bakr**
**Page number(s): 9**

It was the only University-sanctioned event of its kind, an inter-collegiate beer drinking competition which began in the 1940s and became an integral part of the annual Yale Spring Weekend. 
But on December 9th the Council of Masters rejected the JCSC's proposal for a modified Tang competition, thereby officially cancelling Tang once and for all. "It didn't seem to us that a drinking event was the kind of activity that a university should be putting itself · behind," Chairman of the Council of Masters Robin Winks explained. Well, fair enough, especially in light of the recently enacted legal drinking age of 20. But many feel that the dissolution of Tang leaves a hole in the social fabric of undergraduate tradition. 
The JCSC (Joint Council of Social Chairpersons),which ran the event, has considered several alternatives, but none of them qualified as a satisfactory substitute. Ezra Stiles sophomore Ben Eason, a new JCSC Co-Chairperson, went so far as to propose tanging with root beer, but the Tang people "wouldn't go for it." Milk Tang was vetoed as "unhealthy." Apparently, Tang just isn't the same without alcohol. 
But as long as Tang included alcohol, the University feared that it was sponsoring an illegal activity. "I think it's fair to say that if there hadn't been abuse of it in the past, Tang wouldn't be dead," explained Master Winks. "It's clear that the students who ran it did not take seriously the laws of the state." 
If the Masters are concerned about observing the legal drinking age, one may ask, then why can't the event simply be moderated to exclude students under 20? JCSC Chairperson Ming Tsai presented just such a proposal in November to the Council of Masters outlining strict regulation of Tang events, but it was rejected outright. 
"The reason· Tang was voted down wasn't because of the drinking age," claimed Tsai. "After talking to a couple of masters I realized that the issue is that the University doesn't feel it should sanction the event." 
A. Bartlett Giamatti has made his position on the issue clear. "I'm not anti-traditional," Giamatti explained. "But a tradition which somehow says the University is going to provide free beer and practice space for the sole purpose of drinking fast does not strike me, in the climate which we are in, as a tradition the University ought to cling to. Frankly, it's very hard to defend Tang." 
Despite the efforts of the administration to stop Tang, it is sure to continue in some form. In several colleges "secret" practices are held in students' rooms, and a number of Tang captains are planning underground Tang tournaments for the spring. There has been talk of trying to set up something formal at Toad's, or at the bastion of Yale tradition, Mory's. 
But at least one master believes that the responsibility belongs to Yale and not necessarily to the students. "I'll tell you one thing," Timothy Dwight Master Robert Thompson said, "this is going to make me fight for a Student Union Center-a place where you would have large dances and other social activities. I think Yale owes you one. They took Tang away; something must be given."

**An Interview with Carlos Diaz-Alejandro**
**Author: Morris Panner with Charles Wortman**
**Page number(s): 10-12**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Morris Panner 
with Charles V\brtman 
Carlos F. 
Diaz-Alejandro, professor of 
economics at Yale and an expert on Latin 
American economic development, served for 
the last six months as a Reagan appointee on 
the National Bipartisan Commission on 
Central America, better known as the Kissinger 
Commission. Since the release of the 
Commission's report on January 10, analysts 
have been debating its meaning and its recommendations for extensive 
military 
and 
economic aid to Central America. 
The only point of agreement is that the 
Commission has generated an unexpected 
amount of controversy. In July 1983, when 
the White House announced Diaz-Alejandro's 
appointment, the anti-Castro Cuban ex-
ile community in this country accused Diaz-
Alejandro, who describes himself as a liberal 
democrat, of being a Castro sympathizer and 
supporter and demanded his removal. Diaz-
Alejandro had, in fact, visited Cuba once in 
1977 on an academic trip as a guest of the 
Central Committee of the Cuban Communist 
Party and again in 1978 on a more political 
trip with the "Group of 75" to seek the release 
of Cuban political prisoners and the 
reunification of families. It was rumored for 
several days in July that the Diaz-Alejandro 
choice had been a case of mistaken identity 
and that the White House would replace 
him. But after the F.B.I. granted him a 
security 
clearance, 
Diaz-Alejandro 
was 
sworn in with the other 11 members of the 
commission at the White House on August 
10. 

After the report's release, Diaz-Alejandro 
again emerged as a controversial figure. He 
played an important role in securing the inclusion in the report of a "conditionality 
clause" which advocates that all U.S. aid to 
the nations in the region be conditioned upon 
demonstrated progress in human rights. This 
clause was considered a setback for the administration, which rejects any linkage of aid 
with human rights. Diaz-Alejandro also 
added a statement of dissent to the report, advocating that the U.S. should end all aid to 
the rebels in Nicaragua, the Contras. 
Morris Panner, Managing Editor of 
TNJ, and Charles Wortman, a fourth-year 
graduate student in economics, spoke with 
Diaz-Alejandro at his offices in Columbia 
University, where he is spending this year as 
a visiting professor. 
10 The New Journal/February 3, 1984 
An Interview with 
Carlos Diaz-Alejandro 
TNJ: 
Given the fact that you have no 
experience in commissions like this one 
and that you're a liberal democrat, why 
did you accept the post? 

Diaz-Alejandro: Well, I rehearsed 
reasons to say "no." One reason to say 
"no" was that the commission was an 
abomination named by a president I 
did not like very much and headed by a 
person whom I was not very enthusiastic 
about at the time. But this did not sound 
very convincing because if I have something 
to say on Central America, it did give me a 
platform. 
The second reason to say "no" was that 
I'm an academic. "My kingdom is not 
of this world." But that sounded a little 
wimpy, so I reluctantly said "yes." 

TNJ: Did the allegations of your connections to Castro cause any conflict 
with your fellow commission members? 

Diaz-Alejandro: I think my colleagues 
were at first unsure. Back in August at 
coffee breaks I would occasionally end 
up talking to a chair. But that may 
have just been my paranoia. Very 
quickly people got very friendly and at 
the end we had a great deal of 
senatorial courtesy. 

TNJ: You said in July you were warned that 
Kissinger was "the great 
seducer." Has your experience confirmed this? 

Diaz-Alejandro: I'm neither a priest 
nor a psychoanalyst, so I'm not going 
to comment either on his personality or 
whether he does or doesn't have trouble 
with his immortal soul. But what I 
can say is that he was a very good 
chairman. One thing which he does 
which is very appealing to an academic 
is think in terms of models, structures. 
Now you can happen to disagree with 
the validity of a lot of his models, but 
it's an interesting experience to discuss 
them with him. 

TNJ: Did you think the commission as 
a whole had a political bias? 

Diaz-Alejandro: Well, it was named 
by President Reagan. Obviously, 
President Carter would have named a 
very different commission. 

TNJ: Would it have written a better 
report? 

Diaz-Alejandro: Oh, yes, I would 
have thought so. Obviously, any document 
of this sort is a creature of compromise. 
We all had our special pet expertise. It 
was worth compromising about. 

TNJ: How would you evaluate the 
competency of your fellow commissioners on Latin American issues? 

Diaz-Alejandro: Hmmm ... It was 
not an expert group. An analogy to 
this group is a jury, a 
reasonably 
intelligent 
group 
of 
laymen. No women, so one doesn't 
have to say laypersons. This was a 
group presumably with an open mind 
to the evidence, and the report is 
suitably modest in pointing this out. 

TNJ: Would you call the report an instruction manual for your average congressman? 

Diaz-Alejandro: Yes. Exactly. That's 
a good phrase. And to the enlightened 
citizen who wants to read something 
about Central America without having 
to buy lots of books. But the Congress 
and other movers of public opinion are 
the main target. 

TNJ: In the report you state that you 
spent only six days in Central America 
and another three days in Mexico and 
Venezuela. How did this limited travel 
affect the outcome of your report? 

Diaz-Alejandro: Don't forget that a 
lot of the people on the commission are 
extremely busy and couldn't spend 
much time traveling. We talked to 
many Central and Latin Americans in 
Washington. Now the trip itself was 
very useful. Specifically, two days were 
most valuable. One in San Salvador 
was, I think, very influential, and I 
always say it was my proudest day as a 
member of the commission. That day, 
at least some of my conservative colleagues really became increasingly 
outraged, realizing that the death 
squads really existed and that they 
were not an invention of the liberal imagination. I think it opened their eyes 
to that. The other day which I would 
say was particularly useful was the day 
in San Jose (Costa Rica). Maybe it's 
fair to say that it was the day for 
liberals to learn. The Costa Ricans are 
very concerned about what's going on 
in Nicaragua, and they feel that the 
trends there are increasingly alarming. 
They of course were very anti-Samoza, 
and they originally supported the 
revolution in Nicaragua. 

TNJ: Did you speak to d'Aubuisson

even as G uatemala "needs" a revolu-
tion. T he d ifficulty intellectually is that 
if we all agree that Guatemala needs a 
revolution, how big a risk are we going 
to take in seeing that revolution come 
to pass? Because it would be nice if 
they had a good old democratic revolu-
tion, but I would not think it was so 
nice if they had a Marxist-Leninist 
revolution. 

TNJ: What do you think the prospects 
are for fair elections in March in El 
Salvador? 
Dia z-Alej and ro: 
I'm cautiously 
pessimistic. If there's hope of some sen-
sible solution in El Salvador, it has to 
come out of the March elections. I 
think the U.S. public should be told 
that the Salvadoran situation is bad, 
very bad, and there are few heroes 
there. 

TNJ: What would be the consequences 
should the March elections fail? 
Diaz-Alejandro: 
There are many 
ways of painting failures. Duarte could 
win and the right could cheat him out 
of it like they did in 1972. There could 
be assassinations, God forbid. T here 
could be a fraud that Jed to a 
d'Aubuisson victory. I find it very hard 
to believe that d'Aubuisson could win 
any honest election. AIJ these things 
would end El Salvador's future. Under 
those conditions I think the U.S. must 
cut ofT any aid- military or economic. 
U nder those conditions there's just 
nothing to build upon. 

TNJ: Will Congress reach the same 
conclusion? 
Diaz-Alejandro: The conditionality 
clause is so strong that those who read 
it fairly will get the point. The condi-
tionality clause is very unambiguous. 

TNJ: What was you r reaction to Larry 
Speakes' · statement, before the report 
was even 
released, 
that President 
Reagan would be "inclined to ignore" 
any conditionality of military aid on 
human rights? 
Diaz-Alejandro: The Speakes' state-
ment was just plain stupid, and the ad-
ministration backed down from it. The 
President was 
specifically very 
gentlemanly in saying that he would 
look into it and would keep an open 
mind. The administration has to. The 
President wilJ just have to take back his 
pocket veto. I think he made a very 
serious error in that. So I think they 
realize 
that without conditionality 
there won't be any aid to El Salvador 
and indeed to any of the other coun-
tries. 

TNJ : What would be the repercussions 
of ending aid to El Salvador? 
Diaz-Alejandro: One can imagine 
many bad sequences of events- first 
victory by the extreme right and then 
victory by the extreme left. It would 
not be good for the Salvadorans nor 
terribly good for U.S. interests. It's 
something the U.S. could live with, 
though, I think. 

TNJ: Even if that meant a Sandan ista-
type government in El Salvador? 
Diaz-Alejand ro: Yes. That's one of 
the issues we debated, and there were 
obvious disagreements. The Kissinger 
position is that a Marxist-Leninist 
triumph in El Salvador would be very, 
very serious for U.S. security interests. 
I would argue that this is an exaggera-
tion. The U.S. still has many friends. I 
like a phrase which I think Lane 
Kirkland (president of the AFL-CIO) 
used, that we just have to find "higher 
ground," and the U.S. can find higher 
ground in Central America. 

T NJ : What is that higher ground? 
Diaz-Alej a ndro: Certainly Costa 
Rica, 
certainly Panama, certainly 
Honduras, and certainly even Belize if 
they want the U.S., and last but not 
least countries like Colombia, M exico 
and Venezuela who would become 
seriously concerned about their own 
security. There is still a lot of earth be-
tween Central America and the U.S. 

TNJ: Do you think one of the keys to 
this is working with the Contadora 
Group (a diplomatic alliance among 
Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Ven-
ezuela) and some of the surrounding 
nations? 
Diaz-Alejandro: Yes, that would be 
extremely helpful. But it should not be 
used as an excuse for not doing 
anything. I think the U.S., the biggest 
country and the one with the most 
resources, has to take the leadership. 

TNJ: What is your reaction to the view 
among students against military aid to 
·El Salvador and against military in-
volvement in the region altogether? 
Diaz-Alejandro: If they are serious 
about finding out what's going on in 
Central America before they jump to 
wearing buttons, they should not just 
write the l:J .S. presence off, but talk to 
a Costa Rican, talk to a Venezuelan 
and get the whole nuanced picture of 
what's going on. 

TNJ: What do you think the chances 
are that today's students will end up 
fighting in Central America? 
Diaz-Alejandro: I think the chance is 
too high for comfort. Yes, I'm afraid 
I'd have to strike that pessimistic note. 
The chances are still much too high. 

TNJ: Do •you think war will be averted 
if the report is followed? 
Diaz-Alejandro: I would not have 
signed it otherwise. Someone said it 
was a blueprint for war. I hope it's a 
blueprint for peace. 

TNJ: In one of your written objections 
to the report you state, if I read it cor-
rectly, that aid to the Nicaraguan 
rebels should not be stopped but 
should be made overtly by the U.S. 
government. 
Diaz-Alejandro: I should have written 
more carefully. I think military aid 


should be stopped at once for the very 


simple reason that it's counterproduc-
tive. On balance, given the U.S. objec-
tives, it doesn't make sense. 

TNJ: No aid whatsoever to the rebels? 
Diaz-Alejandro: None whatsoever. I 
find both covert and overt aid equally 
objectionable. 

TNJ: The problem of debt plagues not 
only Central America but many coun-
tries in South America. The Interna-
tional Monetary Fund (IMF) has 
recom mended strict austerity measures 
in order to reschedule the debt. How 
do you reconcile these recommenda-
tions with the committee's report that 
advocated an across the board increase 
in 
living standards in Central 
America? 
Diaz-Alejandro: Austerity should at 
best be viewed as a very temporary 
stage. People may be surprised to 
know that there was almost unanimity 
within the commission, not to mention 
among the sen ior counselors (who in-
cluded Congressman J ack Kemp), in 
saying that the stabilization plans with 
which 
many 
Central and Latin 
American countries have been saddled 
overemphasize austerity and underem-
phasize growth. So if this is to be inter-
preted as a backhanded criticism of the 
IMF, it is. But in fairness, then you 
just have to have more resources. 
That's why we recommend such an 
ambitious economic program. 

TNJ: Without the IMF would there 
have to be some sort of arm twisting by 
the U.S. government to get bankers to 
accept the stabilization plan for Cen-
tral America? 
Diaz-Alejand ro: Well, if anything 
close to the aid program we recom-
mended gets approved, we won't need 
that arm twisting because then essen-
tially the U.S. would be providing such 
resources that banks would feel much 
more relaxed. 

TNJ: G iven your personal recommen-
dation that American markets should 
be opened to Central American ex-
ports, 
is 
it realistic to . expect a

beleaguered American economy to ac-
cept that? 

Diaz-Alejandro: What is very big for 
Central America may be very small for 
the U.S. The program we recommend 
is $8 billion in five years. Now $1.6 
billion per year is .8 percent of the 
U.S. deficit. It's not going to make this 
country go broke, but that represents 
big money for Central America. 

TNJ: Who do you think would be the 
best president to handle the problems 
in Central America? 

Diaz-Alejandro: Fritz Mondale, no 
doubt about it. Partly. because he had 
the experience with Carter and he was 
sympathetic to the Carter approach, I 
think Mondale would be much better 
than any Republican. 

TNJ: Many have claimed that the 
rhetoric of the report sounds very 
much like President Reagan. Do you 
think this report will help him get re-
elected? 

Diaz-Alejandro: You really think so? 
The New York Times keeps on saying 
that. It certainly wasn't our intention. 
The sad truth is that by November it 
will probably be forgotten at the level 
of most voters so that, no, I don't think 
I've gotten many votes for Reagan rth 
the report. 

TNJ: After reading the report, I came 
away with the impression that the 
dominant issue in the region had to do 
with the East-West conflict and that 
this was where we were going to make 
our stand. Do you think this will be the 
impression in Congress? 

Diaz-Alejandro: I was worried about 
that. I would have hoped that there 
was enough there about the history of 
the region even before Castro began to 
rule Cuba to try to offset that. The 
report at several points emphasizes 
that the roots of the Central American 
problem go back to the colonial days. 
On the other hand there is also a bit of 
truculent Cold War rhetoric which I 
was very uncomfortable with, although 
I became sufficiently convinced that it 
shouldn't be dismissed completely. But 
the report probably exaggerates that. I 
still like to argue that if one reads the


report that one should come out with 
the impression that it is predominantly 
an internal problem which is exacer-
bated by some East-West mucking 
about. 

TNJ: Many observers predicted that 
something like the emphasis on the 
East-West confrontation in the region 
could lead you and the other liberal 
members of the commission to file a 
minority report. How was such a 
report avoided? 

Diaz-Alejandro: By the conditionality 
clause. And by the changes in some of 
the rhetoric. You should have seen 
some of those earlier drafts. In that 
sense, the final outcome was better 
than my worst fears. The conditionali-
ty clause is a very strong point. It's ob-
vious I worried a lot about this Cold 
War rhetoric, and I worried with some 
dear friends in the commission. But we 
kept on saying, "Should we go ahead 
and junk the whole report and write a 
minority report?" The counter to that 
was to say, "Well, look, what's the 
operational significance of the rhetoric 
if one puts in a very strong condi-
tionality clause?" The Congress is not 
going to pass resolutions saying that 
the basic nature of the conflict is East-
West versus indigenous. They're going 
to say, "Well, if we give aid, under 
what conditions?" Were we right? 
History will tell. 

TNJ: Do you have plans of becoming 
an undersecretary of state in a future 
administration? 

Din-Alejandro: No. I kept on saying 
I was going to become an Hispanic 
Kissinger. After serious reflection-
it's kind of fun to fly on those Air Force 
jets and not to have to go through 
customs and to banter with the great. 
But, no, I think if's good to be an 
academic. Being on the commission 
wasn't too bad, but being there all the 
time ... no.

"You want to know about the steam 
tunnels, is that it? Then I guess you 
want to know about the monster." 
The monster? 
"The steam tunnel monster . Oh, it's 
never been proven or anything, but I've 
heard the legends: stories of students 
disappearing, workers in the tunnels 
terrified by strange unexplained noises. 
Me? All I've ever seen down there is a 
cat, but who knows? There could be 
anything in the tunnels." 
Tom Barone should know the steam 
tunnels as well as anyone. After all, he 
has worked in them for almost a quarter 
century. But the steam tunnels at Yale 
are far older than that, older even than 
the residential colleges. 

Like the veins and arteries of the 
human body, the tunnels carry essential 
nutrients to all the buildings on the Yale 
campus. Originating at Physical Plant, 
the command center of Yale utilities, 
these underground, concrete-lined 
passageways travel like a rodent's bur-
row under the Yale campus. Sheltering 
the pipes which carry heat, water and 
electricity to the University community, 
the ten miles of tunnel are essential to 
Yale's existence. 

Each one has its own special purpose. 
One tunnel keeps the water flowing in 
the rowing tanks at Payne Whitney 
gymnasium; another is responsible for 
shedding light on culture at the Yale 
Center for British Art; 13 different tun-
nels provide essential utilities to the 12 
colleges and the Old Campus. In some 
spots the passages are so narrow that 
only a child could crawl through them, 
while in other places workers use 
forklifts to get around. 

Yet pipes are not all that travels 
through this underground network. For 
some students, the mystique of the 
steam tunnels has always had an ir-
resistable allure. One senior in Ezra 
Stiles swears there was once a gorilla in 
the steam tunnels, perhaps adding to 
the legend of the tunnel monster. The 
former master of Pierson, John Hersey, 
remembers one student who lived for 
three years in a small room adjacent to 
a tunnel to avoid the cost of room and 
board. 

But the tunnels also support a 
substantial sub-culture of amateur ex-
plorers. A group of these people came 
together in the early 1970s to form the 
Berkeley Tunneling Team, an organiz-
ation committed to the penetration of 
Yale's subterranean lifelines. The 
organization died after its founders 
graduated, but now, there is another 
society going underground in New 
Haven. 

Numbering about 20 students, this 
new group calls itself the Society for the 
Clandestine Exploration of Steam Tun-
nels at Yale (SCESTY). The members 
of SCESTY are not amateurs. They 
maintain a strict hierarchy among 
themselves, taking into consideration 
seniority and tunneling expertise. Their 
goal is to explore every inch of the tun-
nels, and to find out as much informa-
tion about Yale as they can in the pro-
cess. And, because their activity is 
highly illegal, SCESTY has an almost 
impenetrable 
air of secrecy and 
anonymity around it. 

For 
these 
underground daredevils, exposure is 
dangerous, and not surprisingly, the 
group has thus 
far escaped the 
awareness of all but a tiny few at Yale. 
Before I met Mole, none of this was 
known to me as a fact. But Mole, who 
has been tunneling for years, knew the 
truth behind the rumors I had heard. 
After some convincing, he not only con-
firmed SCESTY's existence, he also 
agreed to act as my guide for a descent 
into the steam tunnels. 

Even with Mole's help, it wasn't easy to 
break into Yale's subterranean world. 
We started our quest in the early morn-
ing hours of a frigid December night, 
armed only with two dying flashlights. 
Our first destination was a small grate 
buried in a wall of Berkeley College. 
One good tug took care of the grate; un-
fortunately, before we'd gotten very far 
we came across a locked door where 
there had been none before. Mole was 
embarrassed by the delay; most locked 
doors at Yale are easily picked, especial-
ly for a tunneler. A thin piece of plastic 
that Mole had forgotten to bring would 
have quickly opened the door. 

Our next attempt was a padlocked 
grate outside of Commons. Through 
the grate we could see the descending 
rungs of a ladder, but our flashlights 
could not penetrate the inky blackness 
at the bottom. Much to Mole's chagrin, 
however, the padlock also thwarted us. 
"I wish I'd come better prepared," he 
sighed. "If I'd brought a hacksaw, we 
could simply have sawed off this lock 
and replaced it with a new one- for 
which I have the only key. Usually 
when I tunnel I come down with teams

the tunnels, I'm always listening." 
of three or four people: an expert at 
Jockpicking, an expert at bypassing 
alarms, and so on. It's really very easy 
to get in that way." 
On our third try, luck was on our 
side. A manhole cover in Branford Col-
lege lifted smoothly out of the ground. I 
climbed down a ladder leading into 
darkness below. Brick pressed against 
my back and made me wish I was just a 
little bit thinner. About 15 feet below 
the ground I felt concrete beneath me; 
above me, Mole was sliding the man-
hole cover back into place, blocking out 
the stars. 

I shined my flashlight around me. 
We were in a long, narrow, concrete 
corridor; the ceiling was uncomfortably 
low, and I had to stoop to avoid bitting 
my head. On one side of me were the 
steam pipes, hanging suspended from 
the ceiling and running farther than I 
could see. Steam hissed from small 
leaks in the pipes, and we could hear 
disembodied voices drifting down to us 
from the world above. The steam made 
breathing difficult; 
the pipes heat 
the tunnels to a minimum of about 110 
degrees, and I was dressed for the chill 
of a New England winter. 

With our flashlights swinging from 
side to side but not helping very much, 
we slowly made our way through the 
tunnel, taking care not to touch the 
scalding-hot pipes. We passed under-
neath York Street, though there was no 
sound of the traffic above. At the en-
trance to Davenport College, we found 
our w<J,Y. blocked by another locked 
door. 

"I could pick it," Mole said, "but I 
think I'll pass on this one. Take a look 
above the door." He pointed to a small 
red wire that I hadn't noticed before: an 
alarm, designed specifcally to keep 
people like us out of the tunnels. 

We went another route, tunneling 
underneath Saybrook College and Elm 
Street, quite possibly the safest way to 
get to the other side of that speedway. 
Across the street was another door. 
Unlike the last, however, this one had 
no little red wire. "I'm going to open 
this," said Mole, "but there could be an 
alarm on the other side. If there is, just 
get out of here as fast as you can. It 
doesn't take long for Yale police to get 
down here." 

Mole opened the door, looked up, 
and started to run. I deduced that there 
was an alarm after all, and followed in 
Mole's disappearing footsteps. Images 
burst through my mind of sirens blar-
ing out through Physical Plant, of 
policemen grabbing rifles and tear gas 
and heading into the tunnels, of me be-
ing escorted out Phelps Gate with my 
luggage strapped to my back. 

Fortunately, none of these night-
mares happened. In what seemed like 
seconds we were climbing up the ladder 
and into the cold air; the only person we 
saw was a lone woman too shocked by 
two men crawling out of a hole in the 
ground at three in the morning to do 
anything about it. 

The next night, Mole and I headed out 
again. This time the Law School would 
be our victim. Though it was again long 
past midnight, it seemed as if all the stu-
dents there were awake and sitting stiff-
ly at desks next to their windows. Mole 
and I felt conspicuously out of place, 
but none of the students we saw even 
looked up from their books. 

Mole had tunneled underneath the 
La~ School before, so we quickly found 
an entrance, a small opening in the 
basement. 
We dropped through, 
though there was only blackness below, 
and found ourselves in a large room, 
almost like a cave. A low hum vibrated 
through the dark, and we traced it to a 
bank of power switches against the wall. 
~ wouldn't touch that," Mole said. 
"You'd almost certainly wind up dead." 
We decided to move on. 

We passed out of that room, into 
another long, hot, and badly-lit cor-
ridor. In the wan beam of my flashlight, 
I 
spotted an old cover 
of Time 
magazine. Ronald Reagan's familiar 
visage beamed out at me from under-
neath almost a decade of dust. The cap-
tion below read "Reagan Heats Up The 
GOP." November 24, 1975. 

Shining ahead, our lights reflected off 
a row of black objects in a small, 
screened-off area. On closer inspection, 
they proved to be water drums, some 
200 of them. On the sides was the in-
timidating label, 
"Office of Civil 
Defense- Emergency 
Shelter 
Supplies." Here, 
ironically, 
tucked 
away underneath the room where Wolf-
gang Leonhard lectured on the Soviet 
Union, was a bomb shelter. These bar-
rels meant a chance at life for sur\ ivors 
of a nuclear war. 

Just ahead, we saw more cold war 
time capsules -loose bottles of various 
medicines, still sealed and probably still 
usable. The medicines were surprising-
ly familiar: aspirin, iodine, baking 
soda, laxatives. It all seemed too mun-
dane for radiation poisoning. Mole 
handed me a small pamphlet, crum-
bling and almost illegible. Dated July, 
1962, the cover read "Fallout Shelter 
Medical Kit- Family Guide to Emer-
gency Health Care." Inside were the in-
structions on the use of the various 
medicines we'd found, "to prevent and 
control emotional problems among 
shelter occupants." I wondered how 
much that aspirin and baking soda had 
done to make 1962 America more 
secure. But the shelter was more in-
triguing than depressing, like finding a 
secret buried in someone's past. 

Satisfied with our unusual find, Mole 
and I left the tunnel and ended that 
night's explorations, though not before 
I'd 
pocketed 
the 
pamphlet as a 
reminder. 

For all its appeal, tunneling is not 
without its drawbacks, being both 
dangerous and illegal. Workers and stu-
dent explorers alike consider the tunnels 
so risky that they will not enter the net-
work without at least one companion. 
One danger is the temperature, which 
in some parts of the tunnels can reach 
150 degrees, making maintenance and 
exploration almost impossible. As Tom 
Barone said, "If you're dm'V11 there alone 
and you faint, or hit your head and get 
knocked out ... well, no one will ever 
find you. God forbid if something ever 
happened." 


"If the steam doesn't burn you to death, it'll suffocate you 
almost immediately." 
A lone explorer could easily get lost 
or trapped in the tunnels. One "Student, 
caught in the tunnels after his way in 
had been blocked off, only escaped by 
squeezing past the whirling steel blades 
of a six-foot fan. 

But by far the greatest danger in the 
steam tunnels comes from the threat of 
a pipe explosion. Heated to some 400 
degrees, under tremendous pressure, 
the steam could easily kill. In addition, 
the pipes in the tunnels are over half a 
century old, and their consequent deter-
ioration makes the possibility of a pipe 
rupture ever greater with the passage of 
time. Bob Sherman, Director of Energy 
Management and Utilities, has in his 
office the remains of an exploded pipe; 
made of one quarter inch steel, the pipe 
was ripped wide open, as if by a giant 
can opener. "There was a man present 
when this happened," Sherman said. 
"He was lucky; he got out. Usually if 
the steam doesn't burn you to death it'll 
suffocate you almost immediately." 

If the tunnels are this dangerous, why 
do Mole and others like him frequently 
risk injury to explore them? An 
associate of Mole's and a member of 
SCESTY said," "We just love to ex-
plore. When you're · tunneling, you're 
maybe ten feet away from civilization, 
but it seems like a lot more. The risk of 
~ting hurt is acceptable; the risk of 
getting caught is a pain. Obviously, we 
don't want to get hurt ... but if we did, 
we sure wouldn't tell anyone how it hap-
pened." Several years ago, in fact, one 
tunneler burned himself on a steam 
pipe badly enought to warrant a trip to 
DUH. Once there, however, the tun-
neler refused to reveal ju~t how his arm 
had been so badly burned, much to the 
irritation of his doctor. 

Though romantics might think that 
the risk of getting caught would add to 
the excitement of exploration, most 
tunnelers disagree. Mole takes par-
ticular care to avoid Yale police. "It's my 
paranoia," he explained, "that keeps me 
from getting caught. In the tunnels, I'm 
always listening . . . for footsteps, loose

change, dangling keys, a policem an's

After my tour of the Law School, I 
decided that it might be interesting to 
go underground in an above-board 
way. And so I arranged with Bob Sher-
man to go on a tour of the Physical 
Plant that would be decidedly more 
legal than what I'd been doing. Sher-
man seemed a bit surprised that anyone 
could be so curious, but he agreed to 
allow me down into the tunnels. 

When I arrived at Physical Plant, one 
quick stop had to be m ad e at a place 
that I'd already come across, under 
somewhat different circumstances: the 
alarm center. Before we could actually 
descend into the tunnels, Sherman had 
to notify a guard of our presence so we 
could avoid tripping any of the hun-
dreds of alarm wires crawling through-
out the tunnel system. 

Before 1977 there were no ruaru1S. 
But in that year Local 35, Yale's blue-
collar union, went on a prolonged 
strike, and 
tensions 
between 
the 
University and the union grew high-
so high, in fact, that there were rumors 
of possible sabotage against the vital 
maintenance systems sheltered by the 
tunnels· by striking union members or 
their supporters. Though Sherman said 
that nothing ever happened during the 
course of that strike, the alarms were 
never shut off and are now used to keep 
students out of the tunnels. 

Sherman led me into a small, q uiet 
room where a uniformed man sat in 
front of a desk. Above him loomed a 
large electronic display screen brightly 
showing the tunnel network. Red lights, 
which flash when security has been 
breached, marked the en trances to the 
tunnels. The guard looked at us rather 
suspiciously, and only grudgingly ac-
cepted Sherman's explanation of our 
trip. 

Sherman and I went down a creaky 
metal staircase into the basement of the 
plant, the very center of the spider's web 
of tunnels. This enormous room bears a 
resemblance to Dante's Inferno. 
Machines pound at a .deafening level, 
making it impossible to talk without 
shouting. Steam seems to jet from 
nowhere, for no reason <~.nd with no 
warning. Murky lighting and twisting, 
hanging pipes force you to stay alert. 
The heat was nearly as intolerable as it 
was within the tunnels. 

Sherman draped his jacket over a 
pipe and led the way to a solid steel door 
embedded in one wall. He took a bunch 
of keys from his pocket and ch uckled. 
"Well, you wanted to see a tunnel, so 
here you go." The door opened quickly 
with a key. This was certainly easier 
than pulling grates out of walls, sawing 
through padlocks and jumping through 
basement windows. 

I followed Sherman into the tunnel, 
which I'd seen prominently displayed 
on the alarm screen upstairs. One of the 
longest of the underground pathways, 
the tunnel runs all the way to T imothy 
D wight in one direction, and the Yale 
Center for British Art in another. O nce 
inside this core, an experienced tun-
neler could make his way virtually 
anywhere underneath Yale. As we 
walked slowly down the tunnel, Sher-
man explained the difficulties of tunnel 
maintenance. The heat, he said, made 
it almost impossible to work in the tun-
nel for more than an hour at a time, and 
workers have to take frequent breaks. 
Maintenance is slow, painstaking and 
prohibitively expensive. 

After about a hundred yards we came 
to a fork in the tunnel. Beyond, ·pipes 
stretched out farther than I could see. 
Overhead, we could feel cars speeding 
down Tower Parkway. From this point 
on, the tunnel was sprinkled with turns, 
extensions, intersections and the like. 
"We have to turn back here," Sherman 
said. Reluctantly, I agreed, though my 
mind was straining at the leash of his 
authority. Still, as we walked back to 
the entrance, 
I glanced over my 
shoulder for one last look. I couldn't 
help but think of Mole, and of what he 
would do wiili ilie heavy keychain 
which dangled loosely from Sherman's 
outstretched hand.

**Title: The Making of a Poet**
**Author: Katherine Scobey**
**Page number(s): 27**

Four years ago the initials "H.D ." were 
unknown by just about everyone. Some 
scholars of English literature recognized 
them as the signature of Hilda Doolit-
tle, one of the earliest imagists. What 
they had read, they had forgotten. 

But in the past three years, H .D., 
who died in 1961, has begun to achieve 
a fame which one far-sighted American 
Studies professor at Yale believed she 
deserved all along. As early as 1936, 
Nonnan Holmes Pearson was prepar-
ing the ground and planting the seeds 
for the sudden flowering of H .D. H e 
collected her writings from a half cen-
tury into an archive now belonging to 
the Beinecke Library, and was respon-
sible for recognizing and publishing 
BOrne of her most important work. Yet 
Pearson, who died nine years ago, 
never saw the sudden rise in H.D.'s 
popularity that is largely the result of his 
efForts. 

Pearson's friend and colleague at 
Yale, Louis Martz, Sterling Professor of 
English, took up where Pearson left ofT. 
In November of 1983 New Directions 
Publishing Corporation published H. D. 
Coli«ud Poems 1912-1944, edited and 
with an introduction by Martz. It is a 
landmark volume which for the fU"St 
time makes her work available to the 
public as a coherent body. In addition 
to numerous volumes of poetry which 
have been out of print for up to 44 
years, CollecteJ Poems includes some 200 
pages of poems never before published 
or published only once in obscure jour-
nals. 

What is making even more of a 
splash than Martz's volume; however, 
ia a biography of H .D . published last 
month, Herself Defined, 
by Barbara 
Guest. Before the book was· available in 
ltores, it had already been reviewed in 
Vo,w, ·nu New York Times, and Time. 
Guest's is the third biography of H.D. 
to appear in the past three years. And 
three more critical volumes are under-
way. 

Pearson tried but was never able to 
put H .D. in the limelight she enjoys 
now posthumously. More than any-
thing else, the feminist movement is 
responsible for her current renaissance. 
H.D. is an important figure in poetry 
because "the women academics have 
talked about her as being a major 
figure," said Peter Glassgold, editor of 
H.D. material at New Directions. "She 
Left, H.D., Norman Holmes 
Pearson and Bryher in front of 
Sterling Memorial Library 
was the undiscovered major woman 
poet" the feminist critics were looking 
for. H.D. is a voice of the eighties, even 
though she wrote during the tens, twen-
ties, thirties, forties and ftfties. Her 
poetry and novels can be read as a 
feminist manifesto- one female artist's 
seeking and fmding herself and her 
work. 

The feminist reading, however, as 
only one which may be applied to 
H.D.'s wr1tmg. Feminism may have 
brought H.D.'s work to scrutiny, but a 
value beyond its apparent sympathy 
with a social movement is what must, 
and probably will, establish it among 
the classics. 

But who was H.D.? Her fans are 
familiar with the delightful storybook 
beginning of her career as a poet. As the 
account goes, Hilda, 26, had been away 
from her strict Moravian home in Up-
per Darby, a suburb of Philadelphia, 
about a year. She was living in London 
as a protegee of her fonner fiance, Ezra 
Pound, the irreverent expatriate from 
Hailey, Idaho, whose red hair stood 
straight up from his forehead and whose 
notions of poetry had been stirring up 
literati on the Continent and in 
England for several years. She had met 
him at age 15 when he was a student at 
the University of Pennsylvania. He left 
behind "Gawel's own, god-damn coun-
try," and a smitten Hilda followed, 
although the marriage never came ofT. 

Hilda had left Bryn Mawr midway 
through her sophomore year, having 
flunked English and barely passed other 
courses, owing, Barbara Guest sug-
gests, to Pound's unorthodox and un-
compromising ideas of what her cur-
riculum ought to comprise. Now, in 
London, she tried her hand at poetry, 
and Pound, the self-established critic 
and promoter of modern poetry, pro-
nounced it good. In a cafe near the 
British Museum, the two let their tea 
grow cold as Pound read Hilda's 
"Hennes of the Ways," signed it with a 
flourish "H.D. Imagiste," and sent it off 
to Harriet Monroe at Poetry magazine in 
Chicago. 

Using the initials "H.D." was a 
brilliant tactic. They wen: eye-catching, 
and they represented perfectly the main 
principle of the new movement, imag-
ism-a paring down of the prosaic, ex-
cessive vene of the end of the 19th cen-

"Pearson decided he was 
going to make H.D. well-
known. He felt, quite 
rightly, that here was a 
neglected poet, an immor-

Below, Louis Martz 
tury to bare essentials, to a single 'im-
age', an "intellectual and emotional com· 
plex in an instant of time," as Pound 
himself defined it. In a letter he 
characterized it as "objectivity-no 
sli.ther; direct-no excessive use of ad· 
jectives . . . It's straight talk." 

The imagists talked hour after hour 
in the tea shops of Kensington, which 
had become the imagist quarter of Lon· 
don. H.D., as Pound's pet disciple, was 
the favored imagist. Pound had in· 
troduced her to the Greek Anthology, and 
she was using the Greek forms for her 
images- figures of the gods from the 
Greek pantheon as masks through 
which to speak, images of Hellenic mar-
ble sculpture, bronze statuary, the 
hard, athletic Greek bodies, and the 
Olympian spirit of contest. H .D ., with 
her svelte five feet 11 inches and her ex· 
otic dress, might have been one of her 
own figures. She always drew a host of 
admirers, yet always she maintained an 
aloofness. She played the role of a 
.... r_..:...::.::::J••• iii Greek goddess who would engage in 
e play and contest with mortals, but who 
~ was ultimately apart. 

It was 1912 when Pound, H .D . and 
~ Richard Aldington (whom H.D. mar· 
~ ried a year later) initiated imagism, and 
i th• -novement grew in influence and at· 
~ trac..ed converts immediately. Within 
6 two years the sublime activity of poetry· 
wnting and tea-drinking came crashing 
to earth as the result of two things. In 
•}914 World War I broke out, and some 
poets, like Aldington, went to the front; 
others were left in. a city plagued by war 
and hunger. Second, imagism faltered 
as Pound, the master of ceremonies and 
promoter of the group with publishers, 
left it to found another movement. The 
bright lights of imagism faded, and 
while imagists certainly continued to 
write and publish, they had lost the 
glamour of the moment. 

Such was H.D.'s beginning. She con· 
tinued to write until her death, yet she 
never enjoyed a similar eminence. This 
was mainly because there was no Pound 
at her side, explaining and promoting 
her work among publishers. H .D . her· 
self was not the dramatic salesman that 
Pound was. She published in various 


important journals- Poetry 
in 
the 
United States, The Egoist and Ford 
Maddox Ford's English 
Review 
England, Transition in Paris and others. 
But not until 1925, 12 years after the 
first H.D. poetry was published in a 
magazine, did she collect a volume of 
her very considerable corpus. She ap-
peared in several anthologies of modern 
poetry, but mainly H.D. pursued her 
own publication erratically, continually 
withholding and revising poems. 

Ultimately H.D. found another pro-
moter-or rather he found her. It was 
Norman Holmes Pearson, a young pro-
fessor at Yale who was then collecting 
information for The Oxford Anthology of 
A71'1ri&an LiJerature. They first met in 
1936 in New York City on one of 
H.D.'s rare trips back to the United 
States, and the meeting proved to be the 
start of a relationship that would shape 
the second half of her career. "I 
remember his talking about her from 
then on," said Louis Martz, then a close 
associate of Pearson at Yale. H.D. was 
so pleased to be included in the Oxford 
anthology, Martz remembers, because 
"it was her first appearance with the 
classics of American literature- Stev-
ens, Whitman . . . " 

Evidently, Pearson was equally 
pleased with H.D. When he lived in 
London as an intelligence officer in the 
Second World War, working on a 
counter-espionage mission, he saw 
H.D. frequently. "H.D. trusted him 
and loved him," said Martz, and Pear-
son encouraged her to send him her 
work which he would preserve on a 
"shelf' at Yale. Pearson had become 
H.D.'s friend and literary represen-
tative; she had granted him power of at-
torney before the war to copyright her 
work and later made him her literary 
executor. Pearson's persistent effort is 
behind most of H.D.'s work published 
after the war, starting with &/ected 
Poems in 1957. 

Encouraging H.D. to collect her 
writing was Pearson's greatest service to 
H.D. Anyone acquainted with modern 
poetry knew H.D., but only as the 
writer of a few imagist poems which had 
appeared in anthologies. After 1931 the

upon the perfection of the female artist,

herself

The perfection of the female artist 
was H.D.'s ideal. Neither her life nor 
her poetry was perfect, but for H .D ., to 
assert and to celebrate a power all her 
own was the essence of art: 
At least I have the flowers of myself

**Taming the Nuclear Leviathan**

Yale Political Scientist Paul Bracken 
Taming the Nuclear Leviathan 
Bracken's analysis may 
render moot much of what 
has been written on the 
subject of nuclear war. 
Design by Tony Reese 
The ComTTUJ.nd and Control of Nuclear Forces 
by Paul Bracken, 1983 Yale University 
Press. $19.95. 252 pp. 
Nuclear theorists are not a reassuring 
lot. They are invariably haunted by 
two memories imprinted in modern 
history, memories which evoke a terror 
surpassed only by their visions of 
future devastation: Munich in 1939 and 
Hitler's subsequent march through 
Europe; and Sarajevo in 1914 and its 
escalation into a pointless world war. 
Yale political scientist Paul Bracken 
is haunted by the latter. He draws a 
parallel between the "fantastically com-
plex" nuclear command systems which 
have evolved in the United States and 
the Soviet Union and the interlocking 
alerts and mobilizations that swamped 
the political process in 1914. The 
modern day leviathan, however, has 
been built on a far more spectacular 
scale than its earlier counterpart. 
The Command and Control of Nuclear 
Forces is an important and readable 
book which, according to Eugene 
Rostow, may provide a new way of 
looking at nuclear arms issues for a 
generation of young scholars. Bracken 
illuminates the potentially catastrophic 
organizational weaknesses and physi-
cal frailties of the command structures 
which control our nuclear arsenal. The 
danger facing the world today, says 
Bracken, who was formerly associated 
with the Hudson Institute, is that the 
superpowers have institutionalized a 
major nuclear showdown. They have 
"built the most complex technological 
apparatus ever conceived without think-
ing through its purpose or how to con-
trol it." 
There was once a time when both 
superpowers regarded nuclear weap-
ons as so uniquely destructive that 
neither entrusted the military with 
their control. But because of the in-
creasing complexity of nuclear strate-
gies, the control of nuclear forces has 
shifted from the political leaders to the 
men in uniform. In theory, only the 
president has the authority to launch a 
nuclear war. In reality, authority has 
been pre-delegated to the military in the 
event that the president .is killed within 
the first few minutes of a nuclear war. 
Bracken believes that we are, in all 
likelihood, less secure today than we 
were 20 years ago. Both the Soviet

Union and the United States have con-
structed warning systems so complex 
and high-strung that a series of 
relatively 
minor events could 
be 
amplified and lead to an extremely 
dangerous escalatiol'l of tension. 
In peacetime this system of massive-
ly redundant checks and balances 
makes remote the likelihood of an ac-
cidental nuclear war provoked by an 
isolated event. A faulty computer chip 
or a Oock of geese which resembles a 
fleet of bombers will not trigger Arma-
geddon today. 
In time of crisis, however, our warn-
ing system takes on an erhircly new 
dimension. When forces are placed on 
alert, the system that ~as intended to 
provide redundant checks on isolated 
errors may, in fact, amplify those er-
rors. Under enormous time pressures 
human operators may misinterpret 
random unrelated events and fearing 
the worst, set in motion a chain reaction 
of reinforcing higher alerts; this danger 
would be particularly acute in a Euro-
pean war. 
During the Hungarian uprising and 
the British and French attack on the 
Suez in 1956, U.S. military command 
received reports that unidentified jet air-
craft were flying over Turkey, that 
Soviet MIGs were flying over Syria, 
that a British bomber had been shot 
down over Syria and that a Russian 
fleet was moving though the Dardan-
elles. The "jets" o~cr Turkey turned 
out to be a flock ofs\.,ans; the MIGs, a 
routine escort. The British bomber was 
downed by mechanical difficulties, and 
the Soviet fleet was engaged in long-
scheduled exercises. 
Catastrophe was averted in 1956. 
Indeed, we have skirted the nuclear 
abyss for 39 years. But the command 
and control system of today is more 
highly sensitized than ever before And 
with the presence of Sovi<•t submannes 
ofT the Atlantic coast who-.(' missiles 
could rea<.:h \'\'ashingwn m less than 
ten minutes and the deployment of 
Pershing II mi1.siles in Europe, the 
commanders must ht' pn·pan:o to 
make split-second cletisions. 
At any moment, warns Bracken, 
these forces can be put on alert, and 
decades of sleepy, unexamined con-
fidence would disappear. The fact that 
nuclear war hasn't happened after so 
many years has lulled some people into 
confidently projecting peace into the 
indefinite future. But Bracken is quick 
to note that a similar feeling of security 
dominated popular and elite opinion in 
the decade preceding World War I. 
People were caught by su rprise when 
the peqce was shattered in Sarajevo 
because the common wisdom was that 
no one would be so irrational as to in-
itiate a major war. Bracken wan ts to 
make sure we remember that lesson. 
Bracken's book has been hailed by 
hawks and doves alike. According to 
McGeorge Bu ndy, former advisor to 
Kennedy and Johnson, there is noth-
ing superior in 
the declassified 
literature to Bracken's analysis of com-
mand and control. Former R eagan ad-
visor Eugene Rostow has described the 
book as "brilliant and sophisticated" 
and "a powerful and constructive exer-
cise in rationality which fully con firms 
the good sense of the taboo against the 
actual 
use of nuclear 
weapons." 
Similarly, 
Paul Warnke, President 
Carter's chief arms n egotiator, believes 
that Bracken's work "demolished the 
myth that nuclear weapons can solve 
all our defense problems if only we 
ls:arn how to build them right and to 
use them flexibly., 
Bracken offers a new focus to the 
study of n u clear war. H is book is a 
rebuff to those whose analysis of the 
nuclear predicament is dominated by 
warhead counts. It is also a rebuff to 
those strategists who, in their pursuit of 
greater sophistication and "hardh~ad~ 
realism," have constructed scenanos rn 
which a limited nuclear war could be 
fought. These scenarios presuppose ra· 
tional 
decision-m aking, 
political 
bargaining during a n uclear exchange, 
and a perfect flow of in formation, each 
of which would be absent or impossible 
during the chaos of confrontation. In~ 
nuclear war , command and commum· 
cation structures would be shattered,

"The only thing worse than an uncontrollable force is a 
political leadership that mistakenly believes it has a 
controllable force." 
and surviving political and military 
leaders would be unable to control any 
conflict. 
"The only thing worse than an un-
controllable force," writes Bracken, "is 
a political leadership that mistakenly 
believes it has a controllable force." 
For the past several months a great 
deal of thought and anguish has been 
directed at the question of the sur-
vivability of our land-based missiles. 
Bracken makes clear, however, that 
regardless of whether one deploys MX 
missiles on a race track, in a dense 
pack or at sea, they will still be 
vulnerable as long as the systems which 
control them are vulnerable. 
The sheer size and survivability of 
American and Soviet nuclear forces 
have driven each side to search for 
weak links in the system. Command 
and control represents such a link. 
American forces could weather a first 
strike. But the command centers in 
Washington and elsewhere could not. 
It would require only a fraction of the 
Soviet arsenal- about 100 warheads-
to "decapitate" America's 
nuclear 
forces by destroying the authority 
needed to use and control them. A few 
warheads targeted at critical points 
along our commercial telephone lines 
could isolate and effectively paralyze 
?ur command system. Thus a strategy 
tn which our centers are targeted for 
destruction by the Soviets offers their 
best hope of escaping retaliation. 
. Yet because of the secrecy surroun-
~mg the flow of authority and the con-
tmgency plans of our command struc-
ture, the Soviet Union cannot yet 
launch an attack with the certainty of 
paralyzing our forces. Such an attack 
might instead set off a pre-arranged 
ch~in reaction of firing authorizations 
~h1ch would, in turn, trigger a mas-
Sive retaliation. This uncertainty, ac-
cording to Bracken, serves as a major 
deterrent to Soviet attack. 
The problem of cascading chain 
reactions is especially acute in Europe, 
perhaps the most likely battleground 
for a nuclear war. In Europe time 
would be compressed and distinctions 
blurred in the event of the outbreak of 
war. Bracken. believes that the line 
which separates a conventional from a 
tactical nuclear war would be difficull 
to discern. The distinction between a 
local tactical and an inter-continental 
strategic war would be even less clear. 
During an alert in Europe nearly 
6,000 warheads normally kept in 
storage and under "lock" would be 
dispersed from the North Sea to the 
plateaus of eastern Turkey. These 
weapons would fall under the sole con-
trol of the military commanders of 
eight different NATO nations. Too 
many decisions would have to be made 
by too many people in a matter of 
seconds. During a state of full alert a 
single European pilot could trigger 
World War III. 
Rather than constructing a means 
and strategy of defending against an 
attack once it occurs, Europe has, by 
choice, 
attempted 
to 
construct 
a 
"regional Doomsday 
machine" so 
unstable and uncontrollable that ·the 
Soviets would never dare step onto 
Western European soil for fear of 
automatically triggering an all-out 
nuclear war. 
Deterrence, 
therefore, 
rests 
not 
upon any elegant theory of escalation-
control and bargaining nor upon the 
careful quantitative comparison of 
nuclear forces, but upon a fear of the 
unknowable and uncontrollable, upon 
a fear that any major provocation-or 
perception of provocation- might 
launch a series of events beyond the 
control of the political leaders or the 
military officers themselves.

Out of the Blue 
Ten Simple Suggestions on How to be an Alumnus 
No matter how many classes 
you skip, no matter how 
many term 
papers you 
mangle, no matter- well, 
almost no matter- how 
many courses you fail, Yale 
is going to make an alumnus 
of you. And once you are an 
alumnus, you will realize 
that your undergraduate 
days were but the larval 
stage of your Yale ca~eer, 
the period in which Yale 
prepared you to become a 
prominent bread-winner for 
higher education. It is a dif-
ficult ·and exp~nsive proposi-
tion to. be a Yale alumnus, 
and one for which you are 
going to get very li.ttle formal 
training. I can't pretend to 
any great expertise or ex-
perience at this business; 
still, after 18 months of 
assiduous reading of the Yale 
Alumni Magazine, I think I 
can offer a few helpful sug-
gestions for everybody who 
feels the imminence of Commencement. 
1. Be rich. This is probably the most important qualifi-
cation for the successful alumnus. Class dues, the Quarter 
Century Fund, and the Yale Alumni Fund are just the 
beginning of the contribution that Yale imagines you 
owe. And as the veal parmigiana in the dining hall and 
the agonies of Bursar's Hold become memories more and 
more distant, you are going to find it harder and harder to 
say "no." But the successful alumnus must be rich not only 
to gratify Yale's material needs; he should be rich to pro-
vide 
titillating reading 
for 
the Alumni Magazine's 
subscribers. From th~ December 1983 issue: "The tomato 
reigned supreme at the magnificent costume party that 
Drue Heinz gave to celebrate jack's 75th birthday at their 
beautiful English home in Ascot. Queen Elizabeth came. 
And in New York City, at their Sutton Place residence, 
there was another superb celebration: mimes, mummers, 
jugglers, acrobats, tumblers, clowns, and a ketchup robot 
that passed out little Heinz pickle pins." 
2. Be thick-skinned. On those few occasions when you 
come into contact with Yale, without being asked for 
money, you will be left in no doubt that you are regarded 
as a senile, football-crazed fool. Don't let this bother you! 
3. Keep your mouth shut. It is something of a shock when 
you learn for the first time that people who did not go to 
Yale have not the slightest interest in that hilarious story 
about the night that you and your freshman roommates 
spent in the company of the New Haven police. For that 
38 The New JournaVFebruary 3, 1984 
matter, there probably aren't 
too many people who did go 
to Yale who want to hear 
it- your freshman room-
mates least of all. 
4. Drop your nickname. Do 
you 
really 
want 
go 
through 
life 
known 
as 
"Chip"? 
5. Live into your nineties. If 
you survive long enough, 
some whipper-snapper with 
a tape recorder from the Yale 
Daily News will decide that 
the hilarious story about the 
night that you and your 
freshman roommate spent 
with the New Haven pollee 
is "oral history." Then you 
can tell it as often as you 
want. 
6. Don't try to explain to your 
friends and relatives why a Yak-
Harvard game matters. 
7. 
Don't get sentimental. 
When you think of Yale, 
remember- the weather; the 
Beth Calleghan/The New Journal 
lines at freshman commons; 
what Mory's green cups really taste like; the lines in the 
Co-op's book section; midterms; mononucleosis; dean's 
excuses; the muck on the floor of Yale Station; the 
Political Union; "Seafood Newburg"; your first hangover; 
the distinctive smell of garbage in your entry-the distinc-
tive smell of your freshman roommate; all-nighters; 
library fines; the coffee at Yorkside; and the horrible mo-
ment when they handed you your diploma and you re-
alized that you still had not found a job. 
8. Don't write to the Magazine about your religious experience. 
It is embarrassing•for everybody. 
9. Resign yourself to the fact that Yale has been going downhill 
in every way since you graduated. Think of Evelyn Waugh's 
story about returning to Oxford in 1948: "A very polite, 
gentle young man got up at the end of the lecture and 
said, 'I should like to ask Mr. Waugh whether it is true, as 
we are always being told, that undergraduates today are 
much stupider, and less cultured, and amusing, than 
undergraduates were in his day.' And I had to say, Well, 
yes it is.' And he said very sadly, 'I thought so,' and sat 
down."
