After my tour of the Law School, I 
decided that it might be interesting to 
go underground in an above-board 
way. And so I arranged with Bob Sher-
man to go on a tour of the Physical 
Plant that would be decidedly more 
legal than what I'd been doing. Sher-
man seemed a bit surprised that anyone 
could be so curious, but he agreed to 
allow me down into the tunnels. 

When I arrived at Physical Plant, one 
quick stop had to be m ad e at a place 
that I'd already come across, under 
somewhat different circumstances: the 
alarm center. Before we could actually 
descend into the tunnels, Sherman had 
to notify a guard of our presence so we 
could avoid tripping any of the hun-
dreds of alarm wires crawling through-
out the tunnel system. 

Before 1977 there were no ruaru1S. 
But in that year Local 35, Yale's blue-
collar union, went on a prolonged 
strike, and 
tensions 
between 
the 
University and the union grew high-
so high, in fact, that there were rumors 
of possible sabotage against the vital 
maintenance systems sheltered by the 
tunnels· by striking union members or 
their supporters. Though Sherman said 
that nothing ever happened during the 
course of that strike, the alarms were 
never shut off and are now used to keep 
students out of the tunnels. 

Sherman led me into a small, q uiet 
room where a uniformed man sat in 
front of a desk. Above him loomed a 
large electronic display screen brightly 
showing the tunnel network. Red lights, 
which flash when security has been 
breached, marked the en trances to the 
tunnels. The guard looked at us rather 
suspiciously, and only grudgingly ac-
cepted Sherman's explanation of our 
trip. 

Sherman and I went down a creaky 
metal staircase into the basement of the 
plant, the very center of the spider's web 
of tunnels. This enormous room bears a 
resemblance to Dante's Inferno. 
Machines pound at a .deafening level, 
making it impossible to talk without 
shouting. Steam seems to jet from 
nowhere, for no reason <~.nd with no 
warning. Murky lighting and twisting, 
hanging pipes force you to stay alert. 
The heat was nearly as intolerable as it 
was within the tunnels. 

Sherman draped his jacket over a 
pipe and led the way to a solid steel door 
embedded in one wall. He took a bunch 
of keys from his pocket and ch uckled. 
"Well, you wanted to see a tunnel, so 
here you go." The door opened quickly 
with a key. This was certainly easier 
than pulling grates out of walls, sawing 
through padlocks and jumping through 
basement windows. 

I followed Sherman into the tunnel, 
which I'd seen prominently displayed 
on the alarm screen upstairs. One of the 
longest of the underground pathways, 
the tunnel runs all the way to T imothy 
D wight in one direction, and the Yale 
Center for British Art in another. O nce 
inside this core, an experienced tun-
neler could make his way virtually 
anywhere underneath Yale. As we 
walked slowly down the tunnel, Sher-
man explained the difficulties of tunnel 
maintenance. The heat, he said, made 
it almost impossible to work in the tun-
nel for more than an hour at a time, and 
workers have to take frequent breaks. 
Maintenance is slow, painstaking and 
prohibitively expensive. 

After about a hundred yards we came 
to a fork in the tunnel. Beyond, ·pipes 
stretched out farther than I could see. 
Overhead, we could feel cars speeding 
down Tower Parkway. From this point 
on, the tunnel was sprinkled with turns, 
extensions, intersections and the like. 
"We have to turn back here," Sherman 
said. Reluctantly, I agreed, though my 
mind was straining at the leash of his 
authority. Still, as we walked back to 
the entrance, 
I glanced over my 
shoulder for one last look. I couldn't 
help but think of Mole, and of what he 
would do wiili ilie heavy keychain 
which dangled loosely from Sherman's 
outstretched hand.
