"Pearson decided he was 
going to make H.D. well-
known. He felt, quite 
rightly, that here was a 
neglected poet, an immor-
tal," said Martz.

tury to bare essentials, to a single 'im-
age', an "intellectual and emotional com· 
plex in an instant of time," as Pound 
himself defined it. In a letter he 
characterized it as "objectivity-no 
sli.ther; direct-no excessive use of ad· 
jectives . . . It's straight talk." 

The imagists talked hour after hour 
in the tea shops of Kensington, which 
had become the imagist quarter of Lon· 
don. H.D., as Pound's pet disciple, was 
the favored imagist. Pound had in· 
troduced her to the Greek Anthology, and 
she was using the Greek forms for her 
images- figures of the gods from the 
Greek pantheon as masks through 
which to speak, images of Hellenic mar-
ble sculpture, bronze statuary, the 
hard, athletic Greek bodies, and the 
Olympian spirit of contest. H .D ., with 
her svelte five feet 11 inches and her ex· 
otic dress, might have been one of her 
own figures. She always drew a host of 
admirers, yet always she maintained an 
aloofness. She played the role of a

It was 1912 when Pound, H .D . and 
~ Richard Aldington (whom H.D. mar· 
~ ried a year later) initiated imagism, and 
i th• -novement grew in influence and at· 
~ trac..ed converts immediately. Within 
6 two years the sublime activity of poetry· 
wnting and tea-drinking came crashing 
to earth as the result of two things. In 
•}914 World War I broke out, and some 
poets, like Aldington, went to the front; 
others were left in. a city plagued by war 
and hunger. Second, imagism faltered 
as Pound, the master of ceremonies and 
promoter of the group with publishers, 
left it to found another movement. The 
bright lights of imagism faded, and 
while imagists certainly continued to 
write and publish, they had lost the 
glamour of the moment. 

Such was H.D.'s beginning. She con· 
tinued to write until her death, yet she 
never enjoyed a similar eminence. This 
was mainly because there was no Pound 
at her side, explaining and promoting 
her work among publishers. H .D . her· 
self was not the dramatic salesman that 
Pound was. She published in various 


important journals- Poetry 
in 
the 
United States, The Egoist and Ford 
Maddox Ford's English 
Review 
England, Transition in Paris and others. 
But not until 1925, 12 years after the 
first H.D. poetry was published in a 
magazine, did she collect a volume of 
her very considerable corpus. She ap-
peared in several anthologies of modern 
poetry, but mainly H.D. pursued her 
own publication erratically, continually 
withholding and revising poems. 

Ultimately H.D. found another pro-
moter-or rather he found her. It was 
Norman Holmes Pearson, a young pro-
fessor at Yale who was then collecting 
information for The Oxford Anthology of 
A71'1ri&an LiJerature. They first met in 
1936 in New York City on one of 
H.D.'s rare trips back to the United 
States, and the meeting proved to be the 
start of a relationship that would shape 
the second half of her career. "I 
remember his talking about her from 
then on," said Louis Martz, then a close 
associate of Pearson at Yale. H.D. was 
so pleased to be included in the Oxford 
anthology, Martz remembers, because 
"it was her first appearance with the 
classics of American literature- Stev-
ens, Whitman . . . " 

Evidently, Pearson was equally 
pleased with H.D. When he lived in 
London as an intelligence officer in the 
Second World War, working on a 
counter-espionage mission, he saw 
H.D. frequently. "H.D. trusted him 
and loved him," said Martz, and Pear-
son encouraged her to send him her 
work which he would preserve on a 
"shelf' at Yale. Pearson had become 
H.D.'s friend and literary represen-
tative; she had granted him power of at-
torney before the war to copyright her 
work and later made him her literary 
executor. Pearson's persistent effort is 
behind most of H.D.'s work published 
after the war, starting with &/ected 
Poems in 1957. 

Encouraging H.D. to collect her 
writing was Pearson's greatest service to 
H.D. Anyone acquainted with modern 
poetry knew H.D., but only as the 
writer of a few imagist poems which had 
appeared in anthologies. After 1931 the
