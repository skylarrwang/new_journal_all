the tunnels, I'm always listening." 
of three or four people: an expert at 
Jockpicking, an expert at bypassing 
alarms, and so on. It's really very easy 
to get in that way." 
On our third try, luck was on our 
side. A manhole cover in Branford Col-
lege lifted smoothly out of the ground. I 
climbed down a ladder leading into 
darkness below. Brick pressed against 
my back and made me wish I was just a 
little bit thinner. About 15 feet below 
the ground I felt concrete beneath me; 
above me, Mole was sliding the man-
hole cover back into place, blocking out 
the stars. 

I shined my flashlight around me. 
We were in a long, narrow, concrete 
corridor; the ceiling was uncomfortably 
low, and I had to stoop to avoid bitting 
my head. On one side of me were the 
steam pipes, hanging suspended from 
the ceiling and running farther than I 
could see. Steam hissed from small 
leaks in the pipes, and we could hear 
disembodied voices drifting down to us 
from the world above. The steam made 
breathing difficult; 
the pipes heat 
the tunnels to a minimum of about 110 
degrees, and I was dressed for the chill 
of a New England winter. 

With our flashlights swinging from 
side to side but not helping very much, 
we slowly made our way through the 
tunnel, taking care not to touch the 
scalding-hot pipes. We passed under-
neath York Street, though there was no 
sound of the traffic above. At the en-
trance to Davenport College, we found 
our w<J,Y. blocked by another locked 
door. 

"I could pick it," Mole said, "but I 
think I'll pass on this one. Take a look 
above the door." He pointed to a small 
red wire that I hadn't noticed before: an 
alarm, designed specifcally to keep 
people like us out of the tunnels. 

We went another route, tunneling 
underneath Saybrook College and Elm 
Street, quite possibly the safest way to 
get to the other side of that speedway. 
Across the street was another door. 
Unlike the last, however, this one had 
no little red wire. "I'm going to open 
this," said Mole, "but there could be an 
alarm on the other side. If there is, just 
get out of here as fast as you can. It 
doesn't take long for Yale police to get 
down here." 

Mole opened the door, looked up, 
and started to run. I deduced that there 
was an alarm after all, and followed in 
Mole's disappearing footsteps. Images 
burst through my mind of sirens blar-
ing out through Physical Plant, of 
policemen grabbing rifles and tear gas 
and heading into the tunnels, of me be-
ing escorted out Phelps Gate with my 
luggage strapped to my back. 

Fortunately, none of these night-
mares happened. In what seemed like 
seconds we were climbing up the ladder 
and into the cold air; the only person we 
saw was a lone woman too shocked by 
two men crawling out of a hole in the 
ground at three in the morning to do 
anything about it. 

The next night, Mole and I headed out 
again. This time the Law School would 
be our victim. Though it was again long 
past midnight, it seemed as if all the stu-
dents there were awake and sitting stiff-
ly at desks next to their windows. Mole 
and I felt conspicuously out of place, 
but none of the students we saw even 
looked up from their books. 

Mole had tunneled underneath the 
La~ School before, so we quickly found 
an entrance, a small opening in the 
basement. 
We dropped through, 
though there was only blackness below, 
and found ourselves in a large room, 
almost like a cave. A low hum vibrated 
through the dark, and we traced it to a 
bank of power switches against the wall. 
~ wouldn't touch that," Mole said. 
"You'd almost certainly wind up dead." 
We decided to move on. 

We passed out of that room, into 
another long, hot, and badly-lit cor-
ridor. In the wan beam of my flashlight, 
I 
spotted an old cover 
of Time 
magazine. Ronald Reagan's familiar 
visage beamed out at me from under-
neath almost a decade of dust. The cap-
tion below read "Reagan Heats Up The 
GOP." November 24, 1975. 

Shining ahead, our lights reflected off 
a row of black objects in a small, 
screened-off area. On closer inspection, 
they proved to be water drums, some 
200 of them. On the sides was the in-
timidating label, 
"Office of Civil 
Defense- Emergency 
Shelter 
Supplies." Here, 
ironically, 
tucked 
away underneath the room where Wolf-
gang Leonhard lectured on the Soviet 
Union, was a bomb shelter. These bar-
rels meant a chance at life for sur\ ivors 
of a nuclear war. 

Just ahead, we saw more cold war 
time capsules -loose bottles of various 
medicines, still sealed and probably still 
usable. The medicines were surprising-
ly familiar: aspirin, iodine, baking 
soda, laxatives. It all seemed too mun-
dane for radiation poisoning. Mole 
handed me a small pamphlet, crum-
bling and almost illegible. Dated July, 
1962, the cover read "Fallout Shelter 
Medical Kit- Family Guide to Emer-
gency Health Care." Inside were the in-
structions on the use of the various 
medicines we'd found, "to prevent and 
control emotional problems among 
shelter occupants." I wondered how 
much that aspirin and baking soda had 
done to make 1962 America more 
secure. But the shelter was more in-
triguing than depressing, like finding a 
secret buried in someone's past. 

Satisfied with our unusual find, Mole 
and I left the tunnel and ended that 
night's explorations, though not before 
I'd 
pocketed 
the 
pamphlet as a 
reminder. 

For all its appeal, tunneling is not 
without its drawbacks, being both 
dangerous and illegal. Workers and stu-
dent explorers alike consider the tunnels 
so risky that they will not enter the net-
work without at least one companion. 
One danger is the temperature, which 
in some parts of the tunnels can reach 
150 degrees, making maintenance and 
exploration almost impossible. As Tom 
Barone said, "If you're dm'V11 there alone 
and you faint, or hit your head and get 
knocked out ... well, no one will ever 
find you. God forbid if something ever 
happened." 


"If the steam doesn't burn you to death, it'll suffocate you 
almost immediately." 
A lone explorer could easily get lost 
or trapped in the tunnels. One "Student, 
caught in the tunnels after his way in 
had been blocked off, only escaped by 
squeezing past the whirling steel blades 
of a six-foot fan. 

But by far the greatest danger in the 
steam tunnels comes from the threat of 
a pipe explosion. Heated to some 400 
degrees, under tremendous pressure, 
the steam could easily kill. In addition, 
the pipes in the tunnels are over half a 
century old, and their consequent deter-
ioration makes the possibility of a pipe 
rupture ever greater with the passage of 
time. Bob Sherman, Director of Energy 
Management and Utilities, has in his 
office the remains of an exploded pipe; 
made of one quarter inch steel, the pipe 
was ripped wide open, as if by a giant 
can opener. "There was a man present 
when this happened," Sherman said. 
"He was lucky; he got out. Usually if 
the steam doesn't burn you to death it'll 
suffocate you almost immediately." 

If the tunnels are this dangerous, why 
do Mole and others like him frequently 
risk injury to explore them? An 
associate of Mole's and a member of 
SCESTY said," "We just love to ex-
plore. When you're Â· tunneling, you're 
maybe ten feet away from civilization, 
but it seems like a lot more. The risk of 
~ting hurt is acceptable; the risk of 
getting caught is a pain. Obviously, we 
don't want to get hurt ... but if we did, 
we sure wouldn't tell anyone how it hap-
pened." Several years ago, in fact, one 
tunneler burned himself on a steam 
pipe badly enought to warrant a trip to 
DUH. Once there, however, the tun-
neler refused to reveal ju~t how his arm 
had been so badly burned, much to the 
irritation of his doctor. 

Though romantics might think that 
the risk of getting caught would add to 
the excitement of exploration, most 
tunnelers disagree. Mole takes par-
ticular care to avoid Yale police. "It's my 
paranoia," he explained, "that keeps me 
from getting caught. In the tunnels, I'm 
always listening . . . for footsteps, loose
