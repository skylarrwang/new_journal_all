Ten Simple Suggestions on How to be an Alumnus 
No matter how many classes 
you skip, no matter how 
many term 
papers you 
mangle, no matter- well, 
almost no matter- how 
many courses you fail, Yale 
is going to make an alumnus 
of you. And once you are an 
alumnus, you will realize 
that your undergraduate 
days were but the larval 
stage of your Yale ca~eer, 
the period in which Yale 
prepared you to become a 
prominent bread-winner for 
higher education. It is a dif-
ficult ·and exp~nsive proposi-
tion to. be a Yale alumnus, 
and one for which you are 
going to get very li.ttle formal 
training. I can't pretend to 
any great expertise or ex-
perience at this business; 
still, after 18 months of 
assiduous reading of the Yale 
Alumni Magazine, I think I 
can offer a few helpful sug-
gestions for everybody who 
feels the imminence of Commencement. 
1. Be rich. This is probably the most important qualifi-
cation for the successful alumnus. Class dues, the Quarter 
Century Fund, and the Yale Alumni Fund are just the 
beginning of the contribution that Yale imagines you 
owe. And as the veal parmigiana in the dining hall and 
the agonies of Bursar's Hold become memories more and 
more distant, you are going to find it harder and harder to 
say "no." But the successful alumnus must be rich not only 
to gratify Yale's material needs; he should be rich to pro-
vide 
titillating reading 
for 
the Alumni Magazine's 
subscribers. From th~ December 1983 issue: "The tomato 
reigned supreme at the magnificent costume party that 
Drue Heinz gave to celebrate jack's 75th birthday at their 
beautiful English home in Ascot. Queen Elizabeth came. 
And in New York City, at their Sutton Place residence, 
there was another superb celebration: mimes, mummers, 
jugglers, acrobats, tumblers, clowns, and a ketchup robot 
that passed out little Heinz pickle pins." 
2. Be thick-skinned. On those few occasions when you 
come into contact with Yale, without being asked for 
money, you will be left in no doubt that you are regarded 
as a senile, football-crazed fool. Don't let this bother you! 
3. Keep your mouth shut. It is something of a shock when 
you learn for the first time that people who did not go to 
Yale have not the slightest interest in that hilarious story 
about the night that you and your freshman roommates 
spent in the company of the New Haven police. For that 
38 The New JournaVFebruary 3, 1984 
matter, there probably aren't 
too many people who did go 
to Yale who want to hear 
it- your freshman room-
mates least of all. 
4. Drop your nickname. Do 
you 
really 
want 
go 
through 
life 
known 
as 
"Chip"? 
5. Live into your nineties. If 
you survive long enough, 
some whipper-snapper with 
a tape recorder from the Yale 
Daily News will decide that 
the hilarious story about the 
night that you and your 
freshman roommate spent 
with the New Haven pollee 
is "oral history." Then you 
can tell it as often as you 
want. 
6. Don't try to explain to your 
friends and relatives why a Yak-
Harvard game matters. 
7. 
Don't get sentimental. 
When you think of Yale, 
remember- the weather; the 
Beth Calleghan/The New Journal 
lines at freshman commons; 
what Mory's green cups really taste like; the lines in the 
Co-op's book section; midterms; mononucleosis; dean's 
excuses; the muck on the floor of Yale Station; the 
Political Union; "Seafood Newburg"; your first hangover; 
the distinctive smell of garbage in your entry-the distinc-
tive smell of your freshman roommate; all-nighters; 
library fines; the coffee at Yorkside; and the horrible mo-
ment when they handed you your diploma and you re-
alized that you still had not found a job. 
8. Don't write to the Magazine about your religious experience. 
It is embarrassing•for everybody. 
9. Resign yourself to the fact that Yale has been going downhill 
in every way since you graduated. Think of Evelyn Waugh's 
story about returning to Oxford in 1948: "A very polite, 
gentle young man got up at the end of the lecture and 
said, 'I should like to ask Mr. Waugh whether it is true, as 
we are always being told, that undergraduates today are 
much stupider, and less cultured, and amusing, than 
undergraduates were in his day.' And I had to say, Well, 
yes it is.' And he said very sadly, 'I thought so,' and sat 
down."
