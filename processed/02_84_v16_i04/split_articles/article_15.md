Four years ago the initials "H.D ." were 
unknown by just about everyone. Some 
scholars of English literature recognized 
them as the signature of Hilda Doolit-
tle, one of the earliest imagists. What 
they had read, they had forgotten. 

But in the past three years, H .D., 
who died in 1961, has begun to achieve 
a fame which one far-sighted American 
Studies professor at Yale believed she 
deserved all along. As early as 1936, 
Nonnan Holmes Pearson was prepar-
ing the ground and planting the seeds 
for the sudden flowering of H .D. H e 
collected her writings from a half cen-
tury into an archive now belonging to 
the Beinecke Library, and was respon-
sible for recognizing and publishing 
BOrne of her most important work. Yet 
Pearson, who died nine years ago, 
never saw the sudden rise in H.D.'s 
popularity that is largely the result of his 
efForts. 

Pearson's friend and colleague at 
Yale, Louis Martz, Sterling Professor of 
English, took up where Pearson left ofT. 
In November of 1983 New Directions 
Publishing Corporation published H. D. 
Coli«ud Poems 1912-1944, edited and 
with an introduction by Martz. It is a 
landmark volume which for the fU"St 
time makes her work available to the 
public as a coherent body. In addition 
to numerous volumes of poetry which 
have been out of print for up to 44 
years, CollecteJ Poems includes some 200 
pages of poems never before published 
or published only once in obscure jour-
nals. 

What is making even more of a 
splash than Martz's volume; however, 
ia a biography of H .D . published last 
month, Herself Defined, 
by Barbara 
Guest. Before the book was· available in 
ltores, it had already been reviewed in 
Vo,w, ·nu New York Times, and Time. 
Guest's is the third biography of H.D. 
to appear in the past three years. And 
three more critical volumes are under-
way. 

Pearson tried but was never able to 
put H .D. in the limelight she enjoys 
now posthumously. More than any-
thing else, the feminist movement is 
responsible for her current renaissance. 
H.D. is an important figure in poetry 
because "the women academics have 
talked about her as being a major 
figure," said Peter Glassgold, editor of 
H.D. material at New Directions. "She 
Left, H.D., Norman Holmes 
Pearson and Bryher in front of 
Sterling Memorial Library 
was the undiscovered major woman 
poet" the feminist critics were looking 
for. H.D. is a voice of the eighties, even 
though she wrote during the tens, twen-
ties, thirties, forties and ftfties. Her 
poetry and novels can be read as a 
feminist manifesto- one female artist's 
seeking and fmding herself and her 
work. 

The feminist reading, however, as 
only one which may be applied to 
H.D.'s wr1tmg. Feminism may have 
brought H.D.'s work to scrutiny, but a 
value beyond its apparent sympathy 
with a social movement is what must, 
and probably will, establish it among 
the classics. 

But who was H.D.? Her fans are 
familiar with the delightful storybook 
beginning of her career as a poet. As the 
account goes, Hilda, 26, had been away 
from her strict Moravian home in Up-
per Darby, a suburb of Philadelphia, 
about a year. She was living in London 
as a protegee of her fonner fiance, Ezra 
Pound, the irreverent expatriate from 
Hailey, Idaho, whose red hair stood 
straight up from his forehead and whose 
notions of poetry had been stirring up 
literati on the Continent and in 
England for several years. She had met 
him at age 15 when he was a student at 
the University of Pennsylvania. He left 
behind "Gawel's own, god-damn coun-
try," and a smitten Hilda followed, 
although the marriage never came ofT. 

Hilda had left Bryn Mawr midway 
through her sophomore year, having 
flunked English and barely passed other 
courses, owing, Barbara Guest sug-
gests, to Pound's unorthodox and un-
compromising ideas of what her cur-
riculum ought to comprise. Now, in 
London, she tried her hand at poetry, 
and Pound, the self-established critic 
and promoter of modern poetry, pro-
nounced it good. In a cafe near the 
British Museum, the two let their tea 
grow cold as Pound read Hilda's 
"Hennes of the Ways," signed it with a 
flourish "H.D. Imagiste," and sent it off 
to Harriet Monroe at Poetry magazine in 
Chicago. 

Using the initials "H.D." was a 
brilliant tactic. They wen: eye-catching, 
and they represented perfectly the main 
principle of the new movement, imag-
ism-a paring down of the prosaic, ex-
cessive vene of the end of the 19th cen-
