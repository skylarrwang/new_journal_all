"The only thing worse than an uncontrollable force is a 
political leadership that mistakenly believes it has a 
controllable force." 
and surviving political and military 
leaders would be unable to control any 
conflict. 
"The only thing worse than an un-
controllable force," writes Bracken, "is 
a political leadership that mistakenly 
believes it has a controllable force." 
For the past several months a great 
deal of thought and anguish has been 
directed at the question of the sur-
vivability of our land-based missiles. 
Bracken makes clear, however, that 
regardless of whether one deploys MX 
missiles on a race track, in a dense 
pack or at sea, they will still be 
vulnerable as long as the systems which 
control them are vulnerable. 
The sheer size and survivability of 
American and Soviet nuclear forces 
have driven each side to search for 
weak links in the system. Command 
and control represents such a link. 
American forces could weather a first 
strike. But the command centers in 
Washington and elsewhere could not. 
It would require only a fraction of the 
Soviet arsenal- about 100 warheads-
to "decapitate" America's 
nuclear 
forces by destroying the authority 
needed to use and control them. A few 
warheads targeted at critical points 
along our commercial telephone lines 
could isolate and effectively paralyze 
?ur command system. Thus a strategy 
tn which our centers are targeted for 
destruction by the Soviets offers their 
best hope of escaping retaliation. 
. Yet because of the secrecy surroun-
~mg the flow of authority and the con-
tmgency plans of our command struc-
ture, the Soviet Union cannot yet 
launch an attack with the certainty of 
paralyzing our forces. Such an attack 
might instead set off a pre-arranged 
ch~in reaction of firing authorizations 
~h1ch would, in turn, trigger a mas-
Sive retaliation. This uncertainty, ac-
cording to Bracken, serves as a major 
deterrent to Soviet attack. 
The problem of cascading chain 
reactions is especially acute in Europe, 
perhaps the most likely battleground 
for a nuclear war. In Europe time 
would be compressed and distinctions 
blurred in the event of the outbreak of 
war. Bracken. believes that the line 
which separates a conventional from a 
tactical nuclear war would be difficull 
to discern. The distinction between a 
local tactical and an inter-continental 
strategic war would be even less clear. 
During an alert in Europe nearly 
6,000 warheads normally kept in 
storage and under "lock" would be 
dispersed from the North Sea to the 
plateaus of eastern Turkey. These 
weapons would fall under the sole con-
trol of the military commanders of 
eight different NATO nations. Too 
many decisions would have to be made 
by too many people in a matter of 
seconds. During a state of full alert a 
single European pilot could trigger 
World War III. 
Rather than constructing a means 
and strategy of defending against an 
attack once it occurs, Europe has, by 
choice, 
attempted 
to 
construct 
a 
"regional Doomsday 
machine" so 
unstable and uncontrollable that ·the 
Soviets would never dare step onto 
Western European soil for fear of 
automatically triggering an all-out 
nuclear war. 
Deterrence, 
therefore, 
rests 
not 
upon any elegant theory of escalation-
control and bargaining nor upon the 
careful quantitative comparison of 
nuclear forces, but upon a fear of the 
unknowable and uncontrollable, upon 
a fear that any major provocation-or 
perception of provocation- might 
launch a series of events beyond the 
control of the political leaders or the 
military officers themselves.
