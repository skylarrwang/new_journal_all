Yale Political Scientist Paul Bracken 
Taming the Nuclear Leviathan 
Bracken's analysis may 
render moot much of what 
has been written on the 
subject of nuclear war.

Nuclear theorists are not a reassuring 
lot. They are invariably haunted by 
two memories imprinted in modern 
history, memories which evoke a terror 
surpassed only by their visions of 
future devastation: Munich in 1939 and 
Hitler's subsequent march through 
Europe; and Sarajevo in 1914 and its 
escalation into a pointless world war. 
Yale political scientist Paul Bracken 
is haunted by the latter. He draws a 
parallel between the "fantastically com-
plex" nuclear command systems which 
have evolved in the United States and 
the Soviet Union and the interlocking 
alerts and mobilizations that swamped 
the political process in 1914. The 
modern day leviathan, however, has 
been built on a far more spectacular 
scale than its earlier counterpart. 
The Command and Control of Nuclear 
Forces is an important and readable 
book which, according to Eugene 
Rostow, may provide a new way of 
looking at nuclear arms issues for a 
generation of young scholars. Bracken 
illuminates the potentially catastrophic 
organizational weaknesses and physi-
cal frailties of the command structures 
which control our nuclear arsenal. The 
danger facing the world today, says 
Bracken, who was formerly associated 
with the Hudson Institute, is that the 
superpowers have institutionalized a 
major nuclear showdown. They have 
"built the most complex technological 
apparatus ever conceived without think-
ing through its purpose or how to con-
trol it." 
There was once a time when both 
superpowers regarded nuclear weap-
ons as so uniquely destructive that 
neither entrusted the military with 
their control. But because of the in-
creasing complexity of nuclear strate-
gies, the control of nuclear forces has 
shifted from the political leaders to the 
men in uniform. In theory, only the 
president has the authority to launch a 
nuclear war. In reality, authority has 
been pre-delegated to the military in the 
event that the president .is killed within 
the first few minutes of a nuclear war. 
Bracken believes that we are, in all 
likelihood, less secure today than we 
were 20 years ago. Both the Soviet

Union and the United States have con-
structed warning systems so complex 
and high-strung that a series of 
relatively 
minor events could 
be 
amplified and lead to an extremely 
dangerous escalatiol'l of tension. 
In peacetime this system of massive-
ly redundant checks and balances 
makes remote the likelihood of an ac-
cidental nuclear war provoked by an 
isolated event. A faulty computer chip 
or a Oock of geese which resembles a 
fleet of bombers will not trigger Arma-
geddon today. 
In time of crisis, however, our warn-
ing system takes on an erhircly new 
dimension. When forces are placed on 
alert, the system that ~as intended to 
provide redundant checks on isolated 
errors may, in fact, amplify those er-
rors. Under enormous time pressures 
human operators may misinterpret 
random unrelated events and fearing 
the worst, set in motion a chain reaction 
of reinforcing higher alerts; this danger 
would be particularly acute in a Euro-
pean war. 
During the Hungarian uprising and 
the British and French attack on the 
Suez in 1956, U.S. military command 
received reports that unidentified jet air-
craft were flying over Turkey, that 
Soviet MIGs were flying over Syria, 
that a British bomber had been shot 
down over Syria and that a Russian 
fleet was moving though the Dardan-
elles. The "jets" o~cr Turkey turned 
out to be a flock ofs\.,ans; the MIGs, a 
routine escort. The British bomber was 
downed by mechanical difficulties, and 
the Soviet fleet was engaged in long-
scheduled exercises. 
Catastrophe was averted in 1956. 
Indeed, we have skirted the nuclear 
abyss for 39 years. But the command 
and control system of today is more 
highly sensitized than ever before And 
with the presence of Sovi<•t submannes 
ofT the Atlantic coast who-.(' missiles 
could rea<.:h \'\'ashingwn m less than 
ten minutes and the deployment of 
Pershing II mi1.siles in Europe, the 
commanders must ht' pn·pan:o to 
make split-second cletisions. 
At any moment, warns Bracken, 
these forces can be put on alert, and 
decades of sleepy, unexamined con-
fidence would disappear. The fact that 
nuclear war hasn't happened after so 
many years has lulled some people into 
confidently projecting peace into the 
indefinite future. But Bracken is quick 
to note that a similar feeling of security 
dominated popular and elite opinion in 
the decade preceding World War I. 
People were caught by su rprise when 
the peqce was shattered in Sarajevo 
because the common wisdom was that 
no one would be so irrational as to in-
itiate a major war. Bracken wan ts to 
make sure we remember that lesson. 
Bracken's book has been hailed by 
hawks and doves alike. According to 
McGeorge Bu ndy, former advisor to 
Kennedy and Johnson, there is noth-
ing superior in 
the declassified 
literature to Bracken's analysis of com-
mand and control. Former R eagan ad-
visor Eugene Rostow has described the 
book as "brilliant and sophisticated" 
and "a powerful and constructive exer-
cise in rationality which fully con firms 
the good sense of the taboo against the 
actual 
use of nuclear 
weapons." 
Similarly, 
Paul Warnke, President 
Carter's chief arms n egotiator, believes 
that Bracken's work "demolished the 
myth that nuclear weapons can solve 
all our defense problems if only we 
ls:arn how to build them right and to 
use them flexibly., 
Bracken offers a new focus to the 
study of n u clear war. H is book is a 
rebuff to those whose analysis of the 
nuclear predicament is dominated by 
warhead counts. It is also a rebuff to 
those strategists who, in their pursuit of 
greater sophistication and "hardh~ad~ 
realism," have constructed scenanos rn 
which a limited nuclear war could be 
fought. These scenarios presuppose ra· 
tional 
decision-m aking, 
political 
bargaining during a n uclear exchange, 
and a perfect flow of in formation, each 
of which would be absent or impossible 
during the chaos of confrontation. In~ 
nuclear war , command and commum· 
cation structures would be shattered,
