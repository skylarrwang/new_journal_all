When a calendar bearing provocative photographs of 12 Yale women appeared in 1982, many people were upset. The controversy even spilled over into the pages of the Yale Daily News when several of the models who had posed for the calendar wrote that their photographs had been misused. 
But the creators of the Daughters of Yale Calendar may have quietly gotten into even deeper trouble than this public dispute. A year and a half later, they still haven't paid most of their bills-which may amount to as much as $10,000 of outstanding debt on the now worthless 1983 calendar. The photographer, S.M. Cooper, whose work has appeared on the cover of Genesis albums, says he is still owed $400. Mary Ann Rumney of the prestigious graphic arts firm Rumney Schiffer which designed the .calendar, says she still has outstanding receipts for for "over $2000" of work. Bill Josline of Eastern Press, which printed over 10,000 copies of the full-color, glossy calendar, says Eastern has received only one third of the money it is due. Finally, the state of Delaware, where American Ivy, Inc. is incorporated to produce the calendar, says the company owes $49 in back taxes. 
When Douglas Becker '81 and Amy Rothman began producing a parody of pin-up calendars ·in 1981, they thought they had a sure bet. The idea was to depict models from Yale in various stereotypes ranging from punk to preppy. Becker. would handle the financial arrangements and Rothman would oversee the artistic and creative work. 
The calendar never sold very well. Most of the 10,000 copies were still in a warehouse last April when the distributor, Inland Books, received permission from Rothman to throw them out. David Wilks, who oversaw . the distribution for Inland, said that sales were ."poor," adding that few bookstores even bothered to select the calendar for sale from Inland's catalogue. 
Meanwhile, Becker has left the country, making it difficult for his creditors to work out a financial solution to their problem. Last January, he went to Israel for three weeks. He was in California for a while in the spring, but last September he was back in New Haven on his way to Europe where he is "wandering around," according to his father. He says he hears from his son occasionally, though he doesn't know when-or if- his son Doug will return to New Haven. 
Rothman has stayed in New Haven where she worked as a waitress for a while. When Becker was here in September, she sold her share of American Ivy to him and says she suspects he will dissolve the company when he returns to the United States.

it is a good thing, this attitude we 
develop at Yale, but what happens to 
our youth in the process? 
Ah, how important it is to be young. 
How important it is to deposit a certain 
amount of shaving cream in an inconvenient place, at least once, and to 
assassinate each other with rubber 
darts. How indispensible it was, my 
sophomore year, when we plotted an 
elaborate scheme to steal the bladder-
ball from Phelps Gate, with steel cable, 
pulleys and a getaway car. Or, the 
time four years ago when a group of 
my friends broke into Sterling Library 
late one night and turned on a few 
dozen strategically-located lights in the 
windows of the stacks. They spelled an 
incandescent four-letter word over 
York Street, photographed this magnificent expletive, and gave the picture to 
our dean as a birthday present. How 
utterly vital it is to do these things, if 
for no other reason that because there 
is no reason at all. It is our youth striking back. 
It ts often forgotten that Yale 
students are also human beings and 
that they have tbeir own.growing up to 
contend with somewhere in between 
James Joyce and freshman chemistry. 
I think the pressure we heap upon 
ourselves to be adults during the week 
pushes us to extremes on the weekend. 
It makes us compress our immaturity 
into a limited time frame. 
Which brings me to the question of 
student violence. There has been much 
talk recently about the subject, thanks 
largely to a new group known as Yale 
Students Against Violence by Yalies. 
The group has come forward to denounce the intolerable number of 
violent deeds perpetrated by Yale 
students. Though the group seems to 
focus a disproportionate amount of attention on shaving cream and fire extinguishers and other petty white 
crimes, it has raised a serious issue. 
Any of us who have ever seen a gutted 
entryway on the morning after or who 
have known someone who has been 
raped must feel the same revulsion and 
infuriation that this group feels. 
But something puzzles me about this 
group's rhetoric. It is, I think, the 
assumption that Yale, unlike other collections of human beings, should 
somehow enjoy immunity from the 
cruder elements of human nature. "We 
offer you an opportunity," their 
literature reads, "to join in the creation 
of a community in which these occurrences are not tolerated." Co-founder 
Ken Dauber echoes this view in the 
YDN: "We hope to create a new culture 
where people who are violent will be 
embarrassed and others are repulsed 
by their violence. We want to change . 
the culture. When people are rowdy 
and others cannot study, 
that's 
violence ... We're not concerned with 
the degree of violence; we just want to 
stop it." 
How dangerously arrogant it is to 
think that Yale should be a perfect 
place, a place where things don't have 
to be "tolerated." What a terrifying 
denial of reality to think that going to 
any unversity for four years could cure 
people of their own nature. What 
puzzles me is that anyone should be 
surprised that Yale students behave 
like other students sometimes do, that 
they sometimes collapse into rage, irrationality, immaturity or meanness. 
This is a subtle form of elitism that I 
am afraid most of us share to some extent: the idea that Yalies make better 
neighbors, fuller humans, and that 
Yale is, or should be, a utopian community. It is reinforced every year 
when the President of Yale presents 
this lofty arrogance in some packaged 
form to the freshman class. "If at Yale 
you can experience the joy that the acquisition and creation of knowledge for 
its own sake brings," wrote President 
Giamatti last September, "the adventure will last your whole life and you 
will have discovered the distinction between living as a full human being and 
merely existing." 
What worries me about Yale Students Against Violence by Yalies, as 
much as I applaud their efforts, is that 
our crusade against "rowdiness" may 
be a sign that we have bought the 
rhetoric from on high. We should 
never let anyone convince us that we 
are a protected class, sliced from the 
inferior bulk of humanity, and thrown 
into an academic village where we are 
obligated to grow up overnight. 
That is what my manifesto would 
have said, anyway.
