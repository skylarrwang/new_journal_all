Carlos F. 
Diaz-Alejandro, professor of 
economics at Yale and an expert on Latin 
American economic development, served for 
the last six months as a Reagan appointee on 
the National Bipartisan Commission on 
Central America, better known as the Kissinger 
Commission. Since the release of the 
Commission's report on January 10, analysts 
have been debating its meaning and its recommendations for extensive 
military 
and 
economic aid to Central America. 
The only point of agreement is that the 
Commission has generated an unexpected 
amount of controversy. In July 1983, when 
the White House announced Diaz-Alejandro's 
appointment, the anti-Castro Cuban ex-
ile community in this country accused Diaz-
Alejandro, who describes himself as a liberal 
democrat, of being a Castro sympathizer and 
supporter and demanded his removal. Diaz-
Alejandro had, in fact, visited Cuba once in 
1977 on an academic trip as a guest of the 
Central Committee of the Cuban Communist 
Party and again in 1978 on a more political 
trip with the "Group of 75" to seek the release 
of Cuban political prisoners and the 
reunification of families. It was rumored for 
several days in July that the Diaz-Alejandro 
choice had been a case of mistaken identity 
and that the White House would replace 
him. But after the F.B.I. granted him a 
security 
clearance, 
Diaz-Alejandro 
was 
sworn in with the other 11 members of the 
commission at the White House on August 
10. 

After the report's release, Diaz-Alejandro 
again emerged as a controversial figure. He 
played an important role in securing the inclusion in the report of a "conditionality 
clause" which advocates that all U.S. aid to 
the nations in the region be conditioned upon 
demonstrated progress in human rights. This 
clause was considered a setback for the administration, which rejects any linkage of aid 
with human rights. Diaz-Alejandro also 
added a statement of dissent to the report, advocating that the U.S. should end all aid to 
the rebels in Nicaragua, the Contras. 
Morris Panner, Managing Editor of 
TNJ, and Charles Wortman, a fourth-year 
graduate student in economics, spoke with 
Diaz-Alejandro at his offices in Columbia 
University, where he is spending this year as 
a visiting professor.

An Interview with 
Carlos Diaz-Alejandro 
TNJ: 
Given the fact that you have no 
experience in commissions like this one 
and that you're a liberal democrat, why 
did you accept the post? 

Diaz-Alejandro: Well, I rehearsed 
reasons to say "no." One reason to say 
"no" was that the commission was an 
abomination named by a president I 
did not like very much and headed by a 
person whom I was not very enthusiastic 
about at the time. But this did not sound 
very convincing because if I have something 
to say on Central America, it did give me a 
platform. 
The second reason to say "no" was that 
I'm an academic. "My kingdom is not 
of this world." But that sounded a little 
wimpy, so I reluctantly said "yes." 

TNJ: Did the allegations of your connections to Castro cause any conflict 
with your fellow commission members? 

Diaz-Alejandro: I think my colleagues 
were at first unsure. Back in August at 
coffee breaks I would occasionally end 
up talking to a chair. But that may 
have just been my paranoia. Very 
quickly people got very friendly and at 
the end we had a great deal of 
senatorial courtesy. 

TNJ: You said in July you were warned that 
Kissinger was "the great 
seducer." Has your experience confirmed this? 

Diaz-Alejandro: I'm neither a priest 
nor a psychoanalyst, so I'm not going 
to comment either on his personality or 
whether he does or doesn't have trouble 
with his immortal soul. But what I 
can say is that he was a very good 
chairman. One thing which he does 
which is very appealing to an academic 
is think in terms of models, structures. 
Now you can happen to disagree with 
the validity of a lot of his models, but 
it's an interesting experience to discuss 
them with him. 

TNJ: Did you think the commission as 
a whole had a political bias? 

Diaz-Alejandro: Well, it was named 
by President Reagan. Obviously, 
President Carter would have named a 
very different commission. 

TNJ: Would it have written a better 
report? 

Diaz-Alejandro: Oh, yes, I would 
have thought so. Obviously, any document 
of this sort is a creature of compromise. 
We all had our special pet expertise. It 
was worth compromising about. 

TNJ: How would you evaluate the 
competency of your fellow commissioners on Latin American issues? 

Diaz-Alejandro: Hmmm ... It was 
not an expert group. An analogy to 
this group is a jury, a 
reasonably 
intelligent 
group 
of 
laymen. No women, so one doesn't 
have to say laypersons. This was a 
group presumably with an open mind 
to the evidence, and the report is 
suitably modest in pointing this out. 

TNJ: Would you call the report an instruction manual for your average congressman? 

Diaz-Alejandro: Yes. Exactly. That's 
a good phrase. And to the enlightened 
citizen who wants to read something 
about Central America without having 
to buy lots of books. But the Congress 
and other movers of public opinion are 
the main target. 

TNJ: In the report you state that you 
spent only six days in Central America 
and another three days in Mexico and 
Venezuela. How did this limited travel 
affect the outcome of your report? 

Diaz-Alejandro: Don't forget that a 
lot of the people on the commission are 
extremely busy and couldn't spend 
much time traveling. We talked to 
many Central and Latin Americans in 
Washington. Now the trip itself was 
very useful. Specifically, two days were 
most valuable. One in San Salvador 
was, I think, very influential, and I 
always say it was my proudest day as a 
member of the commission. That day, 
at least some of my conservative colleagues really became increasingly 
outraged, realizing that the death 
squads really existed and that they 
were not an invention of the liberal imagination. I think it opened their eyes 
to that. The other day which I would 
say was particularly useful was the day 
in San Jose (Costa Rica). Maybe it's 
fair to say that it was the day for 
liberals to learn. The Costa Ricans are 
very concerned about what's going on 
in Nicaragua, and they feel that the 
trends there are increasingly alarming. 
They of course were very anti-Samoza, 
and they originally supported the 
revolution in Nicaragua. 

TNJ: Did you speak to d'Aubuisson
