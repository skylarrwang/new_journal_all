new perception of herself. She focused 
upon the perfection of the female artist, 
establishing independence from the 
male. In two poems this artist is 
represented by a dancer: 
there is a rose flower 
parted wide, 
as her limbs fling wide in dance 
ecstatic 
Aphrodiu, 
there is a frail kwnui.er flown-
hidden in grass; 
0 God whaJ is it, 
this flower 
that in itself had power over tlu whole earth? 
for she needs no man, 
herself 
is that dart and pulse of the male, 
hands, feet, thighs, 
herself perfect. 
The perfection of the female artist 
was H.D.'s ideal. Neither her life nor 
her poetry was perfect, but for H .D ., to 
assert and to celebrate a power all her 
own was the essence of art: 
At least I have the flowers of myself 
and my thoughts, no god 
can taJce that; 
I have the fervour of myself for a presence 
and my own spin't for ligiU; 
and my spin't with its loss 
knows this; 
though smol1 against the black, 
smol1 against the formless rocks, 
hell must lmoJc lxfore I am lost; 
lxjore I am lost, 
heU must open liu a red rose 
for the deod to pass. 
Far from being lost, H.D. is ap-
proaching eminence commensurate to 
that of her male contemporaries. Said 
Martz: •1 wouldn't be at all surprised if 
10 years from now people were saying, 
'H.D.'s the one, not Pound.'•
