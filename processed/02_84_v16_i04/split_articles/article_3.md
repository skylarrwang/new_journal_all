The POR Feuds 
To the Editor: 
I suppose the appetite of your readers 
for rehashing old POR feuds is limited. 
I know mine is. But while we're on the 
subject, let the record show that Wen-
dell Bird's 
1976 "purge" of thirty 
members was illegal and void, and that 
Bird was duly censured, impeached and 
removed from office within a week. As 
for musical bedrooms and all those other 
lurid goodies, most of Bird's charges 
were exaggerated, and the rest were 
nonsense- no Party member, in my 
four years at Yale, sang Nazi songs. 
The Party has its share of turkeys and 
flakes, ·maybe more than its share. But 
through it, I made dear friends, en-
countered new ideas and lost some 
eminently losable illusions. What more 
can a student group give? I look for-
ward to attending the Banquet this 
winter. 
Sincerely, 
Richard Brookhiser 
Editor, National Review 
Sometime Chairman


No Animosity 
As the Chairman and Secretary of the 
Tory Party of the Yale Political Union, 
we read with great interest the recent 
article concerning the Party of the 
Right (TNJ, December 9, 1983). We 
must strongly protest, however, the 
reference to the Tory Party as "the 
POR's bitter enemy in the Political 
Union." Although we sometimes 
disagree with the Party of the Right 
about matters of Political Union policy, 
we fully recognize that it meets the 
needs of an important constituency at 
Yale. Since the purpose of the Tory Par-
ty is to provide a forum for political 
i:liscussion, no possible reason exists for 
animosity between it and any other par-
ty in the Political"Union. Suggestions of 
bitterness between the two groups can 
only help create the. situation they 
describe. 
Very truly yours, 
Walter C. Wagner, Chairman 
Alan D. Viard, Secretary


A Biased Approach 
To the Ed.itor: 
As a former editor of The New journal, I 
was thoroughly disheartened, while 
reading Anne Applebaum's article on 
the Unification Church in New Haven 
(TN}, December 9, 1983), to see the 
amount of non-professionalism that 
your publication now deems acceptable. 
Miss Applebaum's piece was predicated 
throughout on the assumption that 
Moon's followers are ridiculous and not 
worthy of serious consideration. In fact, 
the very title of the article reveals its 
slant: it u$es the term 'Moonies', an ap-
pellation considered derogatory to 
members of the Unification Church. 
Would you be willing to print an article 
about New Haven's J~wish community 
entitled "Yids at Yale"? 
To cite only one other egregious in-
stance of Miss Applebaum's biased ap-
proach, she periodically characterizes 
the Moon followers she interviewed as 
being "very pleased to meet you." Her 
snide repetition of the phrase is ob-
viously meant to evoke the popular im-
age of Unification Church members as 
bland, mindless automatons. While I 


have no more love for the Reverend 
Moon than anyone else, I do not think 
it fair for his organization to be 
publically examined by an observer 
who has no concept of impartiality. The 
Ntw Journal must learn to distinguish 
between true investigation and a super-
cilious gawking at others from a posi-
tion of presumed superiority.

The Hollywood Connection 
Your article on the Yale connection to 
"'War Games" ( TNJ, September 9, 
1983) only told part of the story. Direc-
tor John Badham went to Yale, but so 
did the writers who created the whole 
idea and perservered through several 
years 
of endless 
Hollywood 
"yes-and-no's"- Laurence Lasker and 
Walter Parkes. 
The omission deserves special correc-
tion in this publication, as Larry Lasker 
wrote memorably for The New J ournal 
in its first year of existence, and was 
subsequently its editor. So there is life 
after Yale.
