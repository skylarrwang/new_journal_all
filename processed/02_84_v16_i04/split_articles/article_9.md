even as G uatemala "needs" a revolu-
tion. T he d ifficulty intellectually is that 
if we all agree that Guatemala needs a 
revolution, how big a risk are we going 
to take in seeing that revolution come 
to pass? Because it would be nice if 
they had a good old democratic revolu-
tion, but I would not think it was so 
nice if they had a Marxist-Leninist 
revolution. 

TNJ: What do you think the prospects 
are for fair elections in March in El 
Salvador? 
Dia z-Alej and ro: 
I'm cautiously 
pessimistic. If there's hope of some sen-
sible solution in El Salvador, it has to 
come out of the March elections. I 
think the U.S. public should be told 
that the Salvadoran situation is bad, 
very bad, and there are few heroes 
there. 

TNJ: What would be the consequences 
should the March elections fail? 
Diaz-Alejandro: 
There are many 
ways of painting failures. Duarte could 
win and the right could cheat him out 
of it like they did in 1972. There could 
be assassinations, God forbid. T here 
could be a fraud that Jed to a 
d'Aubuisson victory. I find it very hard 
to believe that d'Aubuisson could win 
any honest election. AIJ these things 
would end El Salvador's future. Under 
those conditions I think the U.S. must 
cut ofT any aid- military or economic. 
U nder those conditions there's just 
nothing to build upon. 

TNJ: Will Congress reach the same 
conclusion? 
Diaz-Alejandro: The conditionality 
clause is so strong that those who read 
it fairly will get the point. The condi-
tionality clause is very unambiguous. 

TNJ: What was you r reaction to Larry 
Speakes' · statement, before the report 
was even 
released, 
that President 
Reagan would be "inclined to ignore" 
any conditionality of military aid on 
human rights? 
Diaz-Alejandro: The Speakes' state-
ment was just plain stupid, and the ad-
ministration backed down from it. The 
President was 
specifically very 
gentlemanly in saying that he would 
look into it and would keep an open 
mind. The administration has to. The 
President wilJ just have to take back his 
pocket veto. I think he made a very 
serious error in that. So I think they 
realize 
that without conditionality 
there won't be any aid to El Salvador 
and indeed to any of the other coun-
tries. 

TNJ : What would be the repercussions 
of ending aid to El Salvador? 
Diaz-Alejandro: One can imagine 
many bad sequences of events- first 
victory by the extreme right and then 
victory by the extreme left. It would 
not be good for the Salvadorans nor 
terribly good for U.S. interests. It's 
something the U.S. could live with, 
though, I think. 

TNJ: Even if that meant a Sandan ista-
type government in El Salvador? 
Diaz-Alejand ro: Yes. That's one of 
the issues we debated, and there were 
obvious disagreements. The Kissinger 
position is that a Marxist-Leninist 
triumph in El Salvador would be very, 
very serious for U.S. security interests. 
I would argue that this is an exaggera-
tion. The U.S. still has many friends. I 
like a phrase which I think Lane 
Kirkland (president of the AFL-CIO) 
used, that we just have to find "higher 
ground," and the U.S. can find higher 
ground in Central America. 

T NJ : What is that higher ground? 
Diaz-Alej a ndro: Certainly Costa 
Rica, 
certainly Panama, certainly 
Honduras, and certainly even Belize if 
they want the U.S., and last but not 
least countries like Colombia, M exico 
and Venezuela who would become 
seriously concerned about their own 
security. There is still a lot of earth be-
tween Central America and the U.S. 

TNJ: Do you think one of the keys to 
this is working with the Contadora 
Group (a diplomatic alliance among 
Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Ven-
ezuela) and some of the surrounding 
nations? 
Diaz-Alejandro: Yes, that would be 
extremely helpful. But it should not be 
used as an excuse for not doing 
anything. I think the U.S., the biggest 
country and the one with the most 
resources, has to take the leadership. 

TNJ: What is your reaction to the view 
among students against military aid to 
·El Salvador and against military in-
volvement in the region altogether? 
Diaz-Alejandro: If they are serious 
about finding out what's going on in 
Central America before they jump to 
wearing buttons, they should not just 
write the l:J .S. presence off, but talk to 
a Costa Rican, talk to a Venezuelan 
and get the whole nuanced picture of 
what's going on. 

TNJ: What do you think the chances 
are that today's students will end up 
fighting in Central America? 
Diaz-Alejandro: I think the chance is 
too high for comfort. Yes, I'm afraid 
I'd have to strike that pessimistic note. 
The chances are still much too high. 

TNJ: Do •you think war will be averted 
if the report is followed? 
Diaz-Alejandro: I would not have 
signed it otherwise. Someone said it 
was a blueprint for war. I hope it's a 
blueprint for peace. 

TNJ: In one of your written objections 
to the report you state, if I read it cor-
rectly, that aid to the Nicaraguan 
rebels should not be stopped but 
should be made overtly by the U.S. 
government. 
Diaz-Alejandro: I should have written 
more carefully. I think military aid 


should be stopped at once for the very 


simple reason that it's counterproduc-
tive. On balance, given the U.S. objec-
tives, it doesn't make sense. 

TNJ: No aid whatsoever to the rebels? 
Diaz-Alejandro: None whatsoever. I 
find both covert and overt aid equally 
objectionable. 

TNJ: The problem of debt plagues not 
only Central America but many coun-
tries in South America. The Interna-
tional Monetary Fund (IMF) has 
recom mended strict austerity measures 
in order to reschedule the debt. How 
do you reconcile these recommenda-
tions with the committee's report that 
advocated an across the board increase 
in 
living standards in Central 
America? 
Diaz-Alejandro: Austerity should at 
best be viewed as a very temporary 
stage. People may be surprised to 
know that there was almost unanimity 
within the commission, not to mention 
among the sen ior counselors (who in-
cluded Congressman J ack Kemp), in 
saying that the stabilization plans with 
which 
many 
Central and Latin 
American countries have been saddled 
overemphasize austerity and underem-
phasize growth. So if this is to be inter-
preted as a backhanded criticism of the 
IMF, it is. But in fairness, then you 
just have to have more resources. 
That's why we recommend such an 
ambitious economic program. 

TNJ: Without the IMF would there 
have to be some sort of arm twisting by 
the U.S. government to get bankers to 
accept the stabilization plan for Cen-
tral America? 
Diaz-Alejand ro: Well, if anything 
close to the aid program we recom-
mended gets approved, we won't need 
that arm twisting because then essen-
tially the U.S. would be providing such 
resources that banks would feel much 
more relaxed. 

TNJ: G iven your personal recommen-
dation that American markets should 
be opened to Central American ex-
ports, 
is 
it realistic to . expect a
