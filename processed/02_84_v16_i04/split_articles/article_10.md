beleaguered American economy to ac-
cept that? 

Diaz-Alejandro: What is very big for 
Central America may be very small for 
the U.S. The program we recommend 
is $8 billion in five years. Now $1.6 
billion per year is .8 percent of the 
U.S. deficit. It's not going to make this 
country go broke, but that represents 
big money for Central America. 

TNJ: Who do you think would be the 
best president to handle the problems 
in Central America? 

Diaz-Alejandro: Fritz Mondale, no 
doubt about it. Partly. because he had 
the experience with Carter and he was 
sympathetic to the Carter approach, I 
think Mondale would be much better 
than any Republican. 

TNJ: Many have claimed that the 
rhetoric of the report sounds very 
much like President Reagan. Do you 
think this report will help him get re-
elected? 

Diaz-Alejandro: You really think so? 
The New York Times keeps on saying 
that. It certainly wasn't our intention. 
The sad truth is that by November it 
will probably be forgotten at the level 
of most voters so that, no, I don't think 
I've gotten many votes for Reagan rth 
the report. 

TNJ: After reading the report, I came 
away with the impression that the 
dominant issue in the region had to do 
with the East-West conflict and that 
this was where we were going to make 
our stand. Do you think this will be the 
impression in Congress? 

Diaz-Alejandro: I was worried about 
that. I would have hoped that there 
was enough there about the history of 
the region even before Castro began to 
rule Cuba to try to offset that. The 
report at several points emphasizes 
that the roots of the Central American 
problem go back to the colonial days. 
On the other hand there is also a bit of 
truculent Cold War rhetoric which I 
was very uncomfortable with, although 
I became sufficiently convinced that it 
shouldn't be dismissed completely. But 
the report probably exaggerates that. I 
still like to argue that if one reads the


report that one should come out with 
the impression that it is predominantly 
an internal problem which is exacer-
bated by some East-West mucking 
about. 

TNJ: Many observers predicted that 
something like the emphasis on the 
East-West confrontation in the region 
could lead you and the other liberal 
members of the commission to file a 
minority report. How was such a 
report avoided? 

Diaz-Alejandro: By the conditionality 
clause. And by the changes in some of 
the rhetoric. You should have seen 
some of those earlier drafts. In that 
sense, the final outcome was better 
than my worst fears. The conditionali-
ty clause is a very strong point. It's ob-
vious I worried a lot about this Cold 
War rhetoric, and I worried with some 
dear friends in the commission. But we 
kept on saying, "Should we go ahead 
and junk the whole report and write a 
minority report?" The counter to that 
was to say, "Well, look, what's the 
operational significance of the rhetoric 
if one puts in a very strong condi-
tionality clause?" The Congress is not 
going to pass resolutions saying that 
the basic nature of the conflict is East-
West versus indigenous. They're going 
to say, "Well, if we give aid, under 
what conditions?" Were we right? 
History will tell. 

TNJ: Do you have plans of becoming 
an undersecretary of state in a future 
administration? 

Din-Alejandro: No. I kept on saying 
I was going to become an Hispanic 
Kissinger. After serious reflection-
it's kind of fun to fly on those Air Force 
jets and not to have to go through 
customs and to banter with the great. 
But, no, I think if's good to be an 
academic. Being on the commission 
wasn't too bad, but being there all the 
time ... no.
