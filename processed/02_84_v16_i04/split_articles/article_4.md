OriginaUy, this was going to be a stu-
dent manifesto. It was going to say that 
Yal~ doesn't give a damn about its 
students anymore. It was going to talk 
about how this university is losing its 
soul and the spark of youth. Yes, my 
manifesto was going to talk about the 
joy of being a colle&e kid, the joy of te-
quila shots and the Saybrook Strippers 
on cold November Saturdays, and 
road trips to Long Island and frisbee 
on President Giamatti's lawn at three 
in the morning. It was going to be 
about the perfect oddity of24 glasses of 
flat beer lined up on Cross Campus on 
a spring day, the kidnapping of the 
Ezra Stiles moose, the colored armies 
on Bladderball afternoons, or the mid-
night my freshman year when 5,000 
Yale students emerged from their win-
dows during exam week in a staged 
event known as the Communal Groan, 
yeUing, "I'm mad as hell and I'm not 
going to take it anymore!" 
Yale, my manifesto would have said, 
is suffocating us, turning us into old 
people before our time. We were 
forfeiting our bright college years, 
refusing them, postponing them, and 
here we were peeping into microscopes 
and turning rhymes and forgetting 
how to laugh in our race to adulthood. 
We were succumbmg to the fretful 
preprofessionalism of our time, the 
academic pressure and the conser-
vative career worry that Yale fans in 
our faces. And now we the Young Peo-
ple were taking the punches, not 
delivering them, 
like middle-aged 
prizefighters stumbling against the 
ropes. 
Ironically, what prevented me from 
writing the manifesto was my own self-
consciousness about sounding young. 
It seemed a juvenile thing to do, draw-
ing battle lines in a place so nearly 
perfect as Yale. It was then that I 
reaJized.the truth, that the adversary of 
our youth is not Yale, but ourselves. 
At Yale we accelerate the process of 
growing up. Our lust for maturity has 
much to do with an image so many of 
us have of ourselves, the image of a 
sophisticated ctttzen, politicized, 
cultured, full of arguments, adroit with 
the Sunday Times. We rush to be that 
citizen. So we do not occupy ourselves 
in the same way that students at most 
universities do. We do not join frater-
nities or sororities; rather, we join The 
Prisoner Film Society and the Coali-
tion Against Apartheid. Yale is our 
grounding in matured elitism, where 
we learn to make lunchdates. Perhaps
