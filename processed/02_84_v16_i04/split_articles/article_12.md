"You want to know about the steam 
tunnels, is that it? Then I guess you 
want to know about the monster." 
The monster? 
"The steam tunnel monster . Oh, it's 
never been proven or anything, but I've 
heard the legends: stories of students 
disappearing, workers in the tunnels 
terrified by strange unexplained noises. 
Me? All I've ever seen down there is a 
cat, but who knows? There could be 
anything in the tunnels." 
Tom Barone should know the steam 
tunnels as well as anyone. After all, he 
has worked in them for almost a quarter 
century. But the steam tunnels at Yale 
are far older than that, older even than 
the residential colleges. 

Like the veins and arteries of the 
human body, the tunnels carry essential 
nutrients to all the buildings on the Yale 
campus. Originating at Physical Plant, 
the command center of Yale utilities, 
these underground, concrete-lined 
passageways travel like a rodent's bur-
row under the Yale campus. Sheltering 
the pipes which carry heat, water and 
electricity to the University community, 
the ten miles of tunnel are essential to 
Yale's existence. 

Each one has its own special purpose. 
One tunnel keeps the water flowing in 
the rowing tanks at Payne Whitney 
gymnasium; another is responsible for 
shedding light on culture at the Yale 
Center for British Art; 13 different tun-
nels provide essential utilities to the 12 
colleges and the Old Campus. In some 
spots the passages are so narrow that 
only a child could crawl through them, 
while in other places workers use 
forklifts to get around. 

Yet pipes are not all that travels 
through this underground network. For 
some students, the mystique of the 
steam tunnels has always had an ir-
resistable allure. One senior in Ezra 
Stiles swears there was once a gorilla in 
the steam tunnels, perhaps adding to 
the legend of the tunnel monster. The 
former master of Pierson, John Hersey, 
remembers one student who lived for 
three years in a small room adjacent to 
a tunnel to avoid the cost of room and 
board. 

But the tunnels also support a 
substantial sub-culture of amateur ex-
plorers. A group of these people came 
together in the early 1970s to form the 
Berkeley Tunneling Team, an organiz-
ation committed to the penetration of 
Yale's subterranean lifelines. The 
organization died after its founders 
graduated, but now, there is another 
society going underground in New 
Haven. 

Numbering about 20 students, this 
new group calls itself the Society for the 
Clandestine Exploration of Steam Tun-
nels at Yale (SCESTY). The members 
of SCESTY are not amateurs. They 
maintain a strict hierarchy among 
themselves, taking into consideration 
seniority and tunneling expertise. Their 
goal is to explore every inch of the tun-
nels, and to find out as much informa-
tion about Yale as they can in the pro-
cess. And, because their activity is 
highly illegal, SCESTY has an almost 
impenetrable 
air of secrecy and 
anonymity around it. 

For 
these 
underground daredevils, exposure is 
dangerous, and not surprisingly, the 
group has thus 
far escaped the 
awareness of all but a tiny few at Yale. 
Before I met Mole, none of this was 
known to me as a fact. But Mole, who 
has been tunneling for years, knew the 
truth behind the rumors I had heard. 
After some convincing, he not only con-
firmed SCESTY's existence, he also 
agreed to act as my guide for a descent 
into the steam tunnels. 

Even with Mole's help, it wasn't easy to 
break into Yale's subterranean world. 
We started our quest in the early morn-
ing hours of a frigid December night, 
armed only with two dying flashlights. 
Our first destination was a small grate 
buried in a wall of Berkeley College. 
One good tug took care of the grate; un-
fortunately, before we'd gotten very far 
we came across a locked door where 
there had been none before. Mole was 
embarrassed by the delay; most locked 
doors at Yale are easily picked, especial-
ly for a tunneler. A thin piece of plastic 
that Mole had forgotten to bring would 
have quickly opened the door. 

Our next attempt was a padlocked 
grate outside of Commons. Through 
the grate we could see the descending 
rungs of a ladder, but our flashlights 
could not penetrate the inky blackness 
at the bottom. Much to Mole's chagrin, 
however, the padlock also thwarted us. 
"I wish I'd come better prepared," he 
sighed. "If I'd brought a hacksaw, we 
could simply have sawed off this lock 
and replaced it with a new one- for 
which I have the only key. Usually 
when I tunnel I come down with teams
