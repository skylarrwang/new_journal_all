((yale's tenure system itself is cumbersome," said 
Sara Suleri, associate professor of English. "It 
would be impossible to say whether it works or 
not. Is it changing? I think .it's changing considerably and 
that is a matter of concern to us all." Yale's procedures for 
appointing senior professors have long withstood attack 
from students and faculty. Unlike tenure at bureaucratic 
state universities, Yale's system relies on unwritten rules and 
flexible regulations. The process remains open to abuse by 
departments and the administration alike. And lately, in 
addition to their perennial charges against Yale's tenure sys-
tem, many harbor fears that ideological agendas play an 
inordinate role in the allotment of Yale's precious perma-
nent seats. 
At most teaching colleges and large state universities, 
junior professors who publish and teach adequately can 
expect tenure within seven years. "It's an uneven system-
people may turn out not to be very productive or distin-
guished scholars," said Robert Dallek, a history professor at 
University of California, Los Angeles. "But only a small 
group of elite schools can afford not to use a tenure-track 
system." 
Yale is one of the lucky few. According to Yale's "ladder" 
system departments promote junior faculty only to the posi-
cion of associate professor without tenure. Faculty without 
tenure can teach at Yale for no more than ten years. In theo-
ry, the university does not promote its own professors to 
tenure but rather reviews Yale faculty along with outside 
candidates whenever a tenure slot appears. A department 
compiles a list of the best candidates in the country by solic-
iting letters from experts in the field; these lists often 
include tenured professors from top universities. "What 
Yale engages in is a star search," said Jeffrey Sammons, chair 
of German. "We're looking for. Leonardo da Vinci if we can 
find him." Between 1960 and 1980, only 14 percent of 
associate professors won permanent posts, and Yale recruit-
ed nearly half of its tenure appointments from outside the 
university. 
Undergraduates benefit from Yale's system, say profes-
sors, for it ensures a constantly changing pool of excellent 
teachers in addition to a star-studded permanent faculty. 
Junior professors face the greatest problems at the hands of 
the ladder system. Because they are not "tracked" for tenure, 
young professors must expect to move on after a decade, 
while Yale replaces them with a new crop of young teachers. 
Junior professors bear much of the burden of undergraduate 
teaching and often stint on their scholarship as a result, 
damaging their chances for tenure elsewhere. "People feel 
the pressure to teach as though they're in a small teaching 
college," said Mark Wollaeger, associate professor of 
English. "If it comes down to a crunch they'll prepare for 
class rather than write a page of their article." 
Much of the undergraduate uproar over junior profes-
sors' failure to win tenure may derive from inflated expecta-
tions. "Undergraduates are very generous," said John 
Morton Blum, professor emeritus of history. "Reading the 
course evaluations, you would believe that nearly every lec-
turer here is perfect." Because Yale depends on a large num-
ber of junior professors for teaching, however, the university 
boasts perhaps three qualified junior professors for every 
tenure slot that opens. "People here look with some envy at 
places like UCLA or Cornell, where the expectation is that 
the person will get tenure," said one professor. "We see that


system as more humane-the junior faculty aren't abused in 
the same way. But if Yale switched to a tenure-track system, 
it would probably be a loss for undergraduates." 
With the loss through attrition of perhaps 30 tenured 
seats after Yale's restructuring, the ratio of qualified junior 
faculty to available permanent posts could skyrocket. "The 
loss of positions might really destroy morale among junior 
faculty," said Diana Wylie, DUS of history. "It's hard when 
you know you're as good as the people who have tenure and 
there are just no spots." But many professors believe that 
Yale's ladder system-similar to those at most Ivy League 
schools-succeeds at retaining the best teachers and schol-
ars. "I think these institutions have a batting average of 
about . 700; that is, seven out of ten people they choose to 
tenure turn out to be the right choice," said Blum. "And I 
would say that nine-tenths of those allowed to leave were 
correctly judged." 
Ten years ago, so many professors distrusted Yale's 
tenure judgments that they demanded an overhaul 
of the process. Yale College Dean Howard Lamar 
established a committee chaired by economics professor 
James Tobin to investigate the situation. The Tobin report 
tried to standardize the tenure process so that appointments 
would no longer succumb to the unwritten rules of depart-
ment politics that had governed Yale procedures for so long. 
Professors disagree on whether the Tobin report succeeded 
in Its mission. "Before the report procedures were too 
loose," said Claude Palisca, chair of music. 'Mer the report, 
tenure became standardized and fair; in general the tenure 
procedures now work well." 
According to many, however, the process remains 
abstruse. "One of the problems is the murky relationship of 
the Tobin report to what's now done," said classics professor 
Victor Bers. The report made recommendations rather than 
hard-and-fast rules, and departments still can bypass steps 
in the process. Despite the report's plea that departments 
communicate regularly with nontenured faculty, junior pro-
fessors claim they rarely know how Yale's tenure system 
works. They never learn ctte official rules, they sar, and they 
sense that unofficial rules play a disproportionate role in the 
process. 
Tenure originally arose to protect professors' freedom of 
speech, but many at Yale fear that when Donald Kagan 
became dean ofYale College, ideology intruded on the pro-
cess to prevent worthy candidates from gaining the academ-
ic freedom of a tenured spot. The once unconcroversial
