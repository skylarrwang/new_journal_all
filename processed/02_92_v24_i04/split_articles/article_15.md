Yale will admit "Yale sons of good 
character and 
reasonable good 
record ... regardless of the number of 
applicants and the superiority of out-
side competitors." 
-Yale Admissions Commi~~. 1929 
though Yale has opened its 
doors to a more diverse student 
ody since 1929, "legacies,"' 
those applicants whose parents attend-
ed Yale College or any Yale graduate or 
professional school, still receive special 
preference in admissions. For Yale and 
other Ivy League schools, the high rate 
of legacy admissions provides a way to 
recognize alumni and court their 
donations. Although the legacy policy 
comes from an earlier time, it contin-
ues to influence the composition of 
today's student body. 

Hopefuls who check the "Yale 
affiliation" box on their applications 
double their chances for acceptance. 
In choosing the class of 1995, the 
Admissions Committee rejected over 
three quarters of all applicants, for a 
general admit rate of 22 percent, but 
opened the doors to 45 percent of 
legacy candidates. 
The 
Yale 
Undergraduate 
Admissions Committee, like its 
counterparts at other Ivy 
League schools, classifies 
legacies, atheletes, and 
minorities as special 
preference groups. 
In the first round of 
the admissions pro-
cess, all candidates 
go through initial 
comparison on a 
regional 
basis.

Members of special preference groups 
who survive this test then go into a 
separate pool, in which they compete 
for admissions against each other. 
Most also receive an extra third read-
ing from the Admissions Committee. 
As a special preference group, 
legacies fare better than minori-

involvement in the school merits spe-

cants, termed "institutionally impor-
tant," can only benefit from such a 
label.

Yale justifies admitting lega-
cies in high numbers because 
they are an investment that 
pays off. Last year, the Yale 
Alumni 
Fund garnered 
affirmative action programs. 
Like the 45 percent of legacy 
"'\ 
candidates, 39 percent of 
Mrican-American applicants, 36 
percent of Mexican-American 
applicants, 32 percent of Native 
American applicants, 28 percent of 
Puerto Rican applicants, and 20 per-
cent of Asian-American applicants 
received acceptance letters. Legacies 
also enroll at higher rates than other 
acceptees, comprising 15 percent of 
this year's freshman class. 
Dean 
of 
Admissions Margie Dahl acknowl-
edges the "positive weight" of Yale 
affiliation, although she claims that 
legacies must meet Yale's standards · 
order to receive admission. "If

For some legacy can-
didates, 
preferential 
treatment goes one 
step further. The list 
of legacy applicants 
goes to Terry M. 
Holcombe (SY '64), 
president of 
pment and 
~~f!i~~ i Affairs, who 
$55.4 million from over 
·48,000 alumni donors to sup-
port Yale's operating budget and 
financial aid programs. Larger gifts 
have boosted Yale's endowment to over 
$2.5 billion. In a special fund-raising 
program called Yale Revisited, Yale tar-
gets selected alums, often with chil-
dren, to reacquaint them with the 
University and ultimately to win a 
substantial donation. With contribu-
tions to the rune of$ 55 million, alum-

Yale.

....,IITI,.v "The University depends on 
loyal alumni to volunteer their ser-
vices," said Holcombe. About 3,000 
alums spur Yale's fund raising drive by 
soliciting annual donations from class· 
mates. A nationwide network of about 
4,000 alums interviews local appli-
cants for the Admissions Office. 
Alums also defray administrative costs 
by serving as Yale Club officers and 
Association ofYale Alumni delegates. 
University officials also argue that 
the legacy statistic reflects the group's 
solid educational background. Dahl 
notes that many Yale alums place 2

this value on to their children. "Well-
educated parents tend to give their 
children a good education," said Dahl. 
Most alumni hold jobs that draw them 
to metropolitan areas, where they can 
live in neighborhoods with strong 
standards and a work ethic in their 
children." Brett Mersereau (SM '95), 
a fifth-generation legacy, believes that 
academic excellence runs in his family. 
"It's pretty valid to assume that if the 
father or mother succeeded here, 
there's a very strong 
chance that their kids 
will also," he said. 
In 1925, Yale led the 
Ivy League in setting 
legacy preference as 
official policy. In order 
to restrict the number 
of Jewish students, who 
were enrolling at Yale 
in record numbers, the 
university ensured that 
sons of its graduates 
would have first crack 
at admission. Yet today, 
other 
Ivy 
League 
schools have far higher 
levels of legacy enroll-
ment. Dartmouth and 
the 
University 
Pennsylvania accepted 
57 percent and 66 per-
cent of legacy candi-
dates respectively for 
the class of 1994. And 
at Harvard, affiliation 
triples a prospective 
student's chances for 
admission.

FEBRUARY 7, 1992 
U.S. Department of Education's 
Office for Civil Rights (OCR) 
opened Harvard University's 
admissions files because they 
had received 
complaints 
about the school's admissions 
decisions. The OCR conclud-
ed that between 1981 and 1988, 
the average legacy student had less 
impressive test scores, grades, and 
extracurriculars than the average non-
legacy candidate, but it determined 
that no laws had been broken.

cording to administrators, 
Yale legacies' qualifications also 
o not always match those of 
other applicants. In the April 1985 
issue of Th~ Nnu journaL, then Dean 
of Admissions Worth David said lega-
cies were "about as qualified" as their 
classmates, but conceded that some 
were not on par with other Yalies. 
According to a former member of the 
Minority 
Admissions 
Advisory 
Committee, scores and grades factor 
less heavily into legacy applications 
than they do into those of other appli-
cants. 

From a practical standpoint, high 
rates for legacy admissions serve the 
best interests of the university. When 
their children come to Yale, alums 
often feel a stronger link to the school. 
Their appreciation translates into 
donations of dollars and time. For a 
private university that depends on 
such resources to keep afloat, alumni 
carry a great deal of weight. Yet the 
legacy policy also sends a message that 
the university values tradition, ties, 
and money over a commitment to 
pure achievement. For the large num-
ber of non-legacy candidates whom 
Yale rejects, the consequences of leav-
ing the affiliations box blank on their 
application must leave a bitter taste.
