While government and nature 
have devastated Stanford, Duke mere-
ly suffers from the recession. The uni-
versity's administration promises to 
keep an eye on the economy instead of 
taking action through cuts or layoffs. 
"The administration has tried to keep 
its axe away from the academic aspects 
of the universiry," said Duke sopho-
more Michael Saul. "While each 
department has had to accept certain 
minor fund reductions, it's difficult to 
remember that we're running a 
deficit." 

While at Yale restructuring has 
called into question the status of the 
Jaynes and Rodin Reports on affirma-
tive action hiring, both Duke and 
Stanford pledge to continue their 
attempts to encourage diversity 
through faculry and other hiring. But 
just as Yale's Restructuring Committee 
has singled out certain departments to 
bear the greatest burden in the current 
crunch, "prioritizing" has become the 
key word at most universities. "We've 
appointed a committee of faculty 
members and senior administra-
tors to look at our priorities," 
noted Murphy. "They will 
decide where U. Chicago will be 
going in the next few years." 

Stanford and Duke plan similar 
assessments. 

Yale repeatedly has evoked 
the specter of budget crisis, while 
other schools merely take out a 
second mortgage on the farm. 
"What's going on here is in some 
ways the opposite of Yale's poli-
cy, .. said Andrew Gross, a senior 
at the Universiry of Chicago. 
"Our administration has almost 
tried to hide our fiscal shortfall, 
hoping not to scare anyone. 
They try to give no indication of

a CrtSlS. 

H
arvard especially shies 
from any inquiry into 
its budget problems. 
"While the faculty of arts and 
sciences is running a $10 mil-
lion deficit, there are ways to 
control costs," said Harvard 
spokesperson Peter Costa. "No 
cuts are planned for the imme-
diate future. The administration 
will take care of the problem." 

Costa refused to explain how the 
"problem" could be resolved without 
curs. 

Some students speculate that 
H arvard hired Neil Rudenstine as a 
fund-raising president who could miti-
gate their budget crisis. "Many people 
think that when the Harvard higher-
ups were looking for a new president 
to replace Derek Bok, one of the 
weightiest factors in their decision was 
mw 
char this person would immediately 
have to lead a new billion-dollar fund-
raising campaign," explained Dante 
Ramos, a Harvard junior. "That's 
about all students have heard about 
the deficit, although we know it's 
there." 

Administrators at Yale and 
Stanford stand out in their determina-
tion to enact permanent budget reduc-
tions. Both believe that their universi-
ties cannot sustain their current sizes 
even in times of economic expansion. 
But whiJe Yale gears up for the debate 
on the restrucruring plan in February, 
life at Stanford has returned to normal 
after the protests of the fall. According 
to Brockenbrough, senior editor of 
the Stanford Daily, "It's very difficult 
to be unhappy at a place where the 
weather is beautiful and the people are 
all extremely attractive and intelli-
gent."
