EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
tenure committees lie at the heart of 
the current debate over Yale's system. 
The four committees-for biological 
sciences, humanities, physical sciences, 
and social sciences-review candidates 
for tenure. In the past they generally 
approved a department's proposal, 
deferring to the expertise of scholars in 
the field. 

Many professors claim ·that the 
composition and role of the tenure 
committees changed with Kagan's 
appointment. They charge that 
Kagan, who officially holds jurisdic-
tion over undergraduate affairs, wrest-
ed undue control over the university 
through the committees. The chair of 
the tenure committees-a position 
that Kagan alternates annually with 
graduate school dean Judith Rodin-
appoints the members of each group. 
Rodin chairs the committees this year, 
though many members remain from 
previous terms. "Any time a dean or a 
president can arbitrarily appoint a 
committee without any accountability 
to the faculty, then the dangers of 
autocracy are evident," said Suleri. In 
the past a relationship of trust between 
faculty and administration-what one 
professor called a "gentlemen's agree-
ment"-prevented such autocracy. 

Critics of the current process 
charge that the committees have over-
stepped their limits as they exercise 
their newfound power. "The commit-
tees should be there to watch out for 
procedural violations," said one pro-
fessor. "Competent departments 
should be left to make their own deci-
sions. 
If a 
department shows 
favoritism or is disintegrating into fac-
tions, then the committees can step 
in." But religious studies professor 
Wayne Meeks, who served on the 
humanities committee for eight years, 
believes the recent changes allow the 
committees to perform effectively. "I 
welcome the changes that were made 
the year before last," he said. "We were 
abdicating our responsibility to people 
who had written letters from else-
where, and the unwieldy set of rules 
made Yale so slow that we would lose 
appointments." 

In the eyes of many professors, 
however, the current administration 
has violated their trust. "When Kagan 
became dean, he saw potentials for 
getting control and did two extremely 
smart things," said David Rodowick, a 
film studies professor who left for the 
University of Rochester last year after 
·he was denied tenure at Yale. "H e 
stacked the senior appointments and 
the course of study committees with 
his allies." The once unremarkable 
humanities tenure committee sudden-
ly attracted attention from across the 
university as it overturned a number of 
departmental 
recommendations. 

"Where the senior appointments com-
mittee should have been attending to 
procedural questions, they were over-
riding the experts," said one professor. 
Others believe that people who 
charge the administration with an ide-
ological agenda are crying wolf. Diana 
Wylie sees no evidence for the allega-
tions and thinks Kagan has been 
unjustly accused. "Because of his con, 
servative 
rhetoric-
notoriously 
provocative and inappropriate for a 
dean-Donald Kagan has become a 
bete noir for people who are worried 
about losing their jobs," she said. 


Some professors attribute inconsisten-
cies in the appointment process to the 
inevitable department politics and 
interpersonal relations. "Ideology is 
certainly not the whole story-some-
times it's the least important factor," 
said Victor J3ers. "The problem is 
more complicated than a nasty right-
wing dean denying tenure to left-wing 
professors." 

But many point to a pattern in 
rejections that they find too powerful 
to be written off as paranoia. They cite 
the review of David Rodowick's candi-
dacy for tenure as an example of an 
ideological process and an activist 
senior appointments committee. Last 
year, the comparative literature and 
American studies departments lobbied 
the administration to fund a tenured 
seat in film studies. After a national 
search the departments sponsored 
Yale's David Rodowick as a candidate 
and unanimously approved the recom-
mendation. Respected in his field, 
Rodowick was a popular teacher and 
almost single-handedly shaped Yale's 
film studies program. "There was a 
fool-proof case for David, so much so 
that his friends didn't even worry," said 
Suleri. "Two books, excellent teacher, 
administrator, international reputation 
as a scholar-what more could he do?" 

The humanities appointments 
committee denied Rodowick tenure. 
The decision provoked such outrage 
among a number of senior professors 
that the committee scheduled an 
unorthodox second hearing, claiming 
to have discovered material they had 
overlooked the first time. They denied 
Rodowick tenure at the second hear-
ing as well. 

Many faculty members familiar 
with Rodowick's work argue that ideol-
ogy influenced his tenure procedure not 
because of Rodowick's political views, 
but rather because the administration 
saw his specialty, film studies, as unde-
sirable. "It was clearly a decision made 
as a judgment on film theory itself and 
not on the merits of Rodowick's work 
in film theory," French professor Peter 
Brooks told the magazine Lingua 
Franca. "I think the people on the com-
mittee didn't particularly know or 
appreciate his work." Rodowick himself 
agrees. "I think that the objective in 
turning down my position was to elimi-
nate film studies," he said. "I felt abso-
lutely nothing personal about the rejec-
tion." 

Because many members of the 
tenure committee were unfamil iar 
with Rodowick's specialty, some 
observers speculate that his case repre-
sents an aberration in the tenure pro-
cess. Others fear a trend toward tenure 
decisions motivated by factors other 
than academic excellence. "We can't 
really refer to a case like David 
Rodowick's without asking 'how can 
this be unideological?'" said Suleri. "I 
think his case is symptomatic, and that 
is the danger." Many see the new 
tenure committees as tantamount to 
an ideologically active Supreme Court. 
"If you have an activist senior appoint-
ments committee, people who aren't 
experts in the field decide who gets 
tenure," said Marshall. 

Critics of the tenure process say 
that Yale must establish a less cumber-
some system, and they demand a 
rerurn to less intrusive tenure commit-
tees. The university's decision to elimi-
nate dozens of tenured slots through 
attrition has added urgency to the 
debate-fierce competition for seats 
will ensure the entire faculty's scrutiny 
of every appointment. Tenure slots 
will become scarcer than ever, and 
junior professors will find it even hard-
er to climb Yale's ladder. In a time of 
budget cuts and job scarcity, some pro-
fessors worry that Yale will tenure only 
the intellectual "safe hers." "We have 
an economic emergency and a non-
tenure-track system at Yale," said Bees. 
"These decisions have to be made with 
the greatest care and consistency."
