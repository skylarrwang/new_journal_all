T
he first time I heard of the possibility of sociol-
ogy being cut was in the Yak Daily N~ws," said 
sociology professor Deborah Davis. "People 
kept calling me to ask, 'Is it true your department is being 
cut?' I thought, 'This is madness. They can't cut an up-and-
coming discipline.' But the rumors kept coming." 
When the Restructuring Committee's report appeared 
on January 15, the gossip Davis had heard for month~ 
proved only half true. Though the department had faced 
possible elimination, the committee recommended cutting 
the number of faculty positions in sociology by close to 50 
percent. The sociology department's experience illustrates 
Yale's secretive and frequently autocratic decision-making 
process, which excludes most of the faculty from consulta-
tion and concentrates power in the hands of a few adminis-
trators. 
At least a year ago, President Benno Schmidt, Provost 
Frank Turner, and Yale College Dean Donald Kagan deter-
mined that a cut of about 15 percent in the faculty budget, 
along with deep reductions in other areas, was necessary to 
maintain the university's financial condition. By the time 
the Restructuring Committee first met in February 1991, 
both Turner and Kagan had developed personal visions for 
the restructuring. They gave the committee the now-famil-
iar list of departments-including sociology, linguistics, 
engineering, and operations research-which they believed 
fell beneath Yale's standards for excellence. They argued that 
the university should focus its resources and eliminate ics 
weaker departments instead of making an across-the-board 
cut that would devastate even strong disciplines. According 
to one committee member, the departments that the 
administration wanted to scrutinize were seen as "problem-
atic by most of the Yale faculty as well." 
The Restructuring Committee pressed the adminiscra· 
cion to demonstrate the necessity for budget reductions. 
"The president and the provost had to compromise on the 
size of the cuts," said Gerald Jaynes, chairman of African·
