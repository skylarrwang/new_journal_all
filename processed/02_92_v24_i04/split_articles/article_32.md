The Yale Police force has beefed 
up its own security efforts on 
Mansfield as well. And despite budget 
cuts throughout the university, the 
department plans to add six new offi-
cers by 1992, making the force an 
unprecedented 66 members strong. 
"The university is really moving ahead 
on police and security," said Perrotti. 
"They're not cutting back at all." 
The Secretary's office also has put 
money where its mouth is on security 
issues. In addition to the highly publi-
cized card-key access system in 
Old Campus, security improve-
ments include more lighting 
throughout campus and extend-
ed hours for the late-night stu-
dent escort service and the 
minibus. While the escon service 
only serves the central campus 
after 12:30 a.m., Mansfield resi-
dents can now take the minibus 
home until 7:30 a.m. Off-cam-

two years. She complained of long 
waits late at night for the shuttle ser-
vice. And de Valpine pointed out that 
while Mansfield is the first stop for 
shuttles coming from campus, if stu-
dents wish to take the shuttle to cam-
pus they must endure a ride through 
the outskirts of Yale that can fre-
quently last over an hour. "It's possi-
ble to be absolutely as safe off-campus 
as on-campus," he said. "But it's a real 
pain." 


pus students routinely complain 
about the lack of a late-night 
escort service to their neighbor-
hoods, but Sternheim calls the 
minibus a safer, more popular 
mode of transportation, especial-
ly for men. "Men typically don't 
take the escort service; they're 
more likely to take the minibus," she 
said. "I would like to make sure that 
men are using some form of security. 
Statistics show that men are greater 
victims of street crime because they're 
more likely to be walking alone." 

Students on Mansfield appreciate 
Yale's security efforts but remain dis-
satisfied. "The campus should be more 
supportive," said Shala Erlich (TC 
Some residents charge that as 
crime has dropped on Mansfield, so 
has police presence. Although the Yale 
police station stands jusr around the 
corner, students say they never see 
uniformed cops from Yale or New 
Haven patrolling the area on foot. "I 
think it would be good to have some-
one walking the beat around here," 
said Barbeau. "This is definitely a 
sub-unit of campus now, with so 
many undergrads and graduate stu-
dents living here. It bugs me that I 
still have to think twice or three times 
about going out after dark." 

But the risks of living on 
Mansfield have decreased dramatical-
ly since September. The new empha-
sis on cooperative crime-fighting has 
cut down on robberies and helped 
transform the area into a safer place to 
live. Mansfield residents remain 
determined to stay on the street, cit-
ing its proximity to campus, its com-
fortable houses, and its residential 
atmosphere. "I'm really h.appy here, 
and if I had to do it over again I 
would definitely live here," de Val pine 
said. "We just don't walk at night."
