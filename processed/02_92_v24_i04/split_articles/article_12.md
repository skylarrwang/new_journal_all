ABouT THIS IssuE 
Several months ago, one professor told 
a N~w ]our_nal writer that Yale had 
reached a turning point. As in the 50s, 
when a more diverse student body 
entered Yale as a result 
of the GI bill, 
and as in 1969, 
when Yale College 
admitted women 
for the first time, 
the university faces 
tough choices about 
how to adapt to a 
world in transition. 
Some members of the 
Yale community take 
issue with the university's 
responses to recession, 
growing cultural diversity, 
and the ivory tower's chang-
ing relationship to the outside world. 
"The restructuring report gives no 
sense that the world is any different 
today than it was 50 years ago," histo-
ry professor Gaddis Smith told us. 
"This is one of those moments when 
universities have to do more than 
restructure--they have to rethink their 
relationship to the world." 
Who defines that relationship? At 
Yale, a number of constituencies have 
advocated visions for the future. The 
restructuring committee wants to 
eliminate weak departments and forge 
a 
smaller, 
stronger 
university. 
Professors insist that academic excel-
lence mwt take priority over financial 
needs. And the unions and GESO 
struggle to retain a voice for workers 
and graduate students. A university 
thrives on controversy and debate, but 
without some sort of consensus, noth-
ing gets done. 
As we interviewed students, pro-
fessors, and administrators about Yale's 
identity crisis, we noticed that they 
frequently knew only what was hap-
pening in their own spheres of interest. 
In this issue, Th~ N~ 
journal hopes to 
inform 
disparate 
Editor's Note 
branches of Yale about 
other parts in the 
whole. The loss o f 
government research 
funds o n Science 
Hill could necessi-
tate 
trimming 
tenure slots in 
other 
depart-
ments.
