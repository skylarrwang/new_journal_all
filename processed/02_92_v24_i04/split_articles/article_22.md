n 1988, President Benno Schmidt and the Yale 
Corporation initated a top to bottom reorganization of 
Yale's School of Organization and Management. Since 
then, the school has endured attacks from disgruntled pro-
fessors, jilted alumni, and disenchanted students. SCM's 
Business ~ek ranking dropped from 19th to 26th in 1989, 
prospective recruiters shied away, and alumni giving plum-
meted from 70 percent participation to 10 percent in one 
year. 

The furor began in 1988, when Schmidt approved a 
dramatic shift in SCM's emphasis from a participatory, 
humanistic approach to management to a more traditional, 
"numbers-oriented" philosophy. Schmidt appointed recent-
ly arrived professor Michael Levine {LAW '65) as Dean of 
SOM and gave him cane blanche to institute sweeping 
changes at the school. Professor David Berg recalls Provost 
Frank Turner's remark, "We are trying to make SOM a 
ccwe see the value in history, but we 
want to look ahead. n 
more traditional business school." 

When Levine took office, Schmidt granted him "emer-
gency powers" and suspended the voting rights of tenured 
faculry on curriculum issues "indefinitely," a period of time 
that lasted for nine months. During this time, the Yale 
Corporation and Schmidt authorized Levine to dismantle 
20 THE NEW jOURNAL 
the Organizational Behavior depanment and move the 
Operations Research department to the graduate school. 

Operations Research (OR) and Organizational 
Behavior (OB) existed at Yale before President IGngman 
Brewster founded SOM in 1976. The two departments 
greatly influenced the management school's curriculum. 
OB became the most popular discipline, frequently over-
shadowing other areas such as finance. A survey conducted 
in 1989 reported that 70 percent of SOM alumni ranked 
OB as the most valuable aspect of the school. 

The new administration felt that the focus on OB was 
taking SOM in the wrong direction. Before the changes, 
OB focused on a distinctly experiential approach to man-
agement. "A disproportionate number of faculty members 
in the school belonged to OB and OR," said Richard 
Silverman, dean of admissions. "It didn't make sense given 
all the other interests that we had as a school and a faculry. 
It was like the tail wagging the dog." 

Some faculty members complained that a narrow focus 
and infighting prevented OB from communicating with 
other departments. According to Berg, the administration 
said, "All future OB appointments need to be able to have 
conversations with economists, in economic terms, and 
with a small faculty it is important to have a common lan-
guage." Using his emergency powers, Levine decided not to 
renew the contracts of any junior faculty in the 
Organizational Behavior department. 

In a second sweeping move, the new administration 
decided to move Operations Research out of SOM and

establish it as a department in the graduate school. Many 
administrators believed the discipline addressed business 
issues from an academic rather than a managerial perspec-
tive. According to Levine, "The people who moved to the 
graduate school tended to be constructing logarithms or 
other problems that had evolved into a branch of applied 
mathematics." The OR department will be completely 
phased out in the next few years if the Yale Corporation 
adopts the recommendations from the committee on 
restructuring. 

Continuing the effort to transform SOM, Levine 
assembled a core curriculum of classes in the first year. The 
core gives all students a common foundation in disciplines 
including accounting, finance, and marketing. "The first 
year is a kind of tool kit, a skill-building year," said 
Silverman. "In the second year applications are emphasized, 
through the use of cases and pragmatic uses of subjects you 
learn in the first year." 

Levine sees the core as an attempt to improve the mar-
ket value of SOM graduates. "A graduate of this school 
needs to be able to do the things the graduate of a tradition-
al business school does, because the market that hires them 
expects that of them," said Levine. Under the old program, 
students could graduate without basic business skills. "The 
old curriculum was very flexible," Levine said. "By stepping 
on stones, you could make it through the stream without 
getting your feet wet" in finance and accounting. "We make 
sure now that everybody has to do some wading." 

SOM alumni feel that the changes were a slap in the 
face. They resented Levine for not consulting them during 
the reorganization. The adminstration's dismantling of the 
OB department changed the face of the school. Alumni 
donations and participation in recruiting dwindled to a 
fraction of their previous levels. 

According to the SOM alumni president, Stewart 
Halpern (TO '78, SOM '82), Levine acts as though it is up 
to the alumni to decide if they want to rejoin the fold. "He 
hasn't done much to get alums back on board. He thinks, 'it 
is nor my problem,'" Halpern said. "People tell me that 
when they get mail from the school they just throw it away. 
No one did anything to reach out, and they were angry-so 
they said 'to hell with them.'"
