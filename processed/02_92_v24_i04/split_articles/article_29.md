From the philosophy department offices at the top of 
SSS, Yale's towers look stable and majestic. But just as 
the disintegration ofYale's buildings demands the 
university's attention, the philosophy department desperate-
ly needs an overhaul. "It's a time of suspense in the philoso-
phy department," said Patricia Blanchette, assistant profes-
sor of philosophy, who arrived at Yale last year. "Changes 
will occur, but it's not clear what form those changes will 
take." The department's greatest failing, its inability to 
retain a solid core of senior professors, has repercussions for 
everyone associated with philosophy at Yale. 


For graduate students, the departmental crisis has 
reached a boiling point. Of the department's four tenured 
professors, the only one teaching this semescer, Ruth 
Marcus, will retire in May. Because of the lack of senior fac-
ulty members, Yale decided to suspend graduace admissions 
for 1992. "Right now, we cannot offer secure training at che 
graduate level," conceded professor Allan Wagner, the 
department's interim chair. For the 31 graduate students 
already here, few senior professors means a dearth of advi-
sors and graduate-only courses. "If we let new grad students 
in, it would be under false pretenses," said David Schmidtt, 
director of undergraduace studies. 


Compared to the flourishing department of the 1960s, 
Yale's current philosophy department offers a sparse crop of 
courses. Experts once ranked Yale among Berkeley, 
Princecon, and the University of Pinsburgh as che finest phi-
losophy departments in che country. Yale had leaders in both 
analytic and continental philosophy, then the two major 
schools of thought. "Yale's suongest point was chat ic had 
representatives from more Wescern schools of philosophy 
than any other major university," said one junior professor. 


Departmental decline began when senior professors 
buned heads over tenure appointments. Alchough the press 
trumpeted "philosophical differences" as the reason for dis-
agreement, department insiders counter chat personality 
conflicts fueled the scruggle. As che tempesc raged, profes-
SOrs--including Harry Frankfurt and Sarah Broadie--fled 
the department. Yale's stringent tenure policy conrribuced 
to the high anrition rate-no junior faculty member has 
received and accepted tenure in philosophy ac Yale for over 


20 years. As other universities lured away Yale's biggest 
names with plum appointments, the department began to 
unravel. 


In 1990, the administration intervened to mend the 
damage. Provost Frank Turner asked Wagner, then psychol-
ogy department chair, to ace as interim chair of philosophy. 
"I have no technical expertise in the area of philosophy," 
said Wagner. "But I was persuaded that I could help to
