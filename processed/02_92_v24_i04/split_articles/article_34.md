The HOC's insistence on veto 
power stems from its experience with 
the construction of the Yale Psychiatric 
Institute (YPI). In 1989, Yale bought 
city land in the Hill to build YPI. 
Taking property off the tax rolls caused 
tempers to flare across the town-gown 
divide. "Yale just plunked this building 
down and damned be the neighbor-
hood," said Fernandez. After a bitter 
political battle among the HOC, some 
city officials, and Yale, the contenders 
negotiated an agreement. YPI would 
rent out a portion of the first floor to a 
taxable commercial establishment, and 
the university planned to develop a job-
training program at YPI for Hill resi-
dents. To date, no one has occupied the 
commercial space and only two people 
graduate from the training program 
every year. 

Some suspect that political 
advancement rather than neighborhood 
development may have moved HOC to 
protest. "The community somehow felt 
they had to beat up Yale to get these 
things at YPI," said Farnam. "Some 
people saw it as pure extortion."

On Winchester Avenue, the Dixwell 
Community 
Development 
Corporation (DCDC) will build 
McCabe Manor, a 31-unit condomini-
um partly financed by a $200,000 
loan from Yale. 

"We try to put out seed money, 
the kind that makes things go for-
ward," said Joni Barnett, director of 
Yale's Office of Community Relations. 
Godshall claimed that Yale's loans had 
provided the crucial construction 
financing that allowed DCDC's 
McCabe Manor to get off the ground. 
At times, the university's investment 
even becomes a stamp of approval for 
a particular project, helping it to 
attract more investors. "Yale's involve-
ment made Science Park possible," 
said Hogan. 

But the most promising steps 
toward a better rapport occur at the 
level of community contact. Every day, 
Barnett's office fields caJls from New 
Haveners asking for Yale assistance in 
one way or another. When DCDC 
needed someone to teach a seminar ro 
train their members on community 
economic development, they called 
Yale's Office of Community relations 
and asked for Barnett. Since Yale does 
not regularly teach courses or maintain 
faculty in rhe field of urban renewal,

n spite of its difficulties with the 
city, Yale slowly has increased com-
munication and cooperation with 
New Haven, partly in response to the 
dire situation in the streets. (See article

Barnett asked a contact at the 
University of New Haven for help.

DCDC's seminar.

Barnett. A Yale representative sits on 
the boards of the HDC, the DCDC, 
and the New Haven Development 
Commission. "If you're a big guy in 
the neighborhood," she added, "you 
have duties to the neighborhood." 

But many in New Haven think 
that Yale has shirked these duties for 
too long. Even with its present invest-
ments, Yale's involvement is not yet up 
to snuff. ·"Yale needs to be more 
aggressive in its investments," said 
Farnam. Although Yale contends that 
its investments help make things hap-
pen, only a handful of projects have 
received university support. 

And Yale's own problems may 
cause the university administration ro 
devote less time to improving town-
gown cooperation. Many New Haven 
leaders believe such a move may be a 
mistake. "It's now a friendly arm's-
length relationship," said Hogan. "But 
a lot more should be done." After a 
legacy of mistrust and competition,
