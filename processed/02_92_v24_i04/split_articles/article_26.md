**SOM's Shifting Sands**

Some students believe that 
President Schmidt has written off the 
SOM alumni who graduated before 
1988. In private meetings with some 
SOM students he has said that he 
plans to build a new alumni base with 
students admitted after SOM's restruc-
turing. For second-year students anx-
ious to find a job, cutting ties with 
SOM alums can hinder employment 
opportunities. "Building a new alumni 
base is very damaging," said John 
Boulet (SOM '92). "If you go to apply 
for a job with an alum who went to 
the school before the changes, they 
will tell you it is not the same school 
anymore." 


In order to rebuild the alumni 
network with people who graduated 
after the changes, SOM enlarged the 
school from 160 per class in 1988 to 
2 17 in 1992. "We have set a very 
ambitious task for ourselves," said 
Levine. "If you have a small student 
body, it is hard to teach courses in pol-
itics and accounting and interdiscipli-
nary courses too. You need more folks." 


According to the administration, 
SOM has managed to enlarge the size 
of the school without diminishing the 
quality of the students it accepts. 
Levine cited GMAT scores in the 95th 
percentile. 


Since his appointment as dean in 1988, Michael Levine has instituted sweeping changes at SOM. 
e changes in the SOM student 
body have progressed more grad-
ually than those in the curricu-
lum. Over the years, the number of 
women enrolled has steadily declined 
while the numbec of foreign students has 
increased (see graph). The number of 
women at SOM peaked in the mid-
1980s at 51 percent and has dropped off 
dramatically since then. Following the 
example of schools like Wharton and 
Harvard, SOM has recruited interna-
tional Students, especially Asians, to dou-
ble their enrollment since the mid-80s. 


The classes of 1992 and 1993 
express the flux of opinion surround-
ing the changes at SOM. Those who 
expected a participatory manage-

ment school feel disappointed in 
SOM's shift in emphasis and their 
lack of voice in administrative deci-
sions. "There are lots of ad hoc com-
munication channels, but not a more 
formal way for students to express 
their concerns," said Adam Feerst 
(SOM '93).

For the most part, the admis-
sions office has caught up with the 
administration's shift in philosophy. 
Most current students knew what to 
expect when they applied and are 
more oriented towards SOM's new 
approach to teaching traditional 
business classes. "There was some 
misunderstanding of what we were 
trying to do here and what was going 
on," Levine said. "People who come 
to the school now are attracted by 
what we are and have a pretty clear 
understanding of what we are doing." 


Most SOM students want to leave 
the controversy behind them and maxi-
mize their experience at Yale. "The vast 
majority are extremely happy," said 
Sean McCaffrey (SOM '92). "We see 
the value in history but we want to look 
ahead. We want to get the most we can 
out of the courses and professors." 


Some still long for a creative 
management school. 
Elizabeth 
Thompson (SOM '93) recalls that 
on the first day of class her professor, 
new from Wharton, responded to a 
request to study non-profit cases by 
asking, "Why would we want to do 
that?" Thompson sees herself as one 
of the last of a dying breed. "Many 
first-year students don't think the 
changes are a bad thing. I know a lot 
of students who came to business 
school," said Thompson. "I wanted 
to shake all these people and say 
'you're not in business school.' " 


When Kingman Brewster founded 
SOM, he intended to create a unique 
management school that would encour-
age its graduates to go out and change 
the world. Many of the students at 
SOM hold on to this vision. There are 
others, however, who believe that the 
changes instituted by the new adminis-
tration have set SOM on the path to 
conformity rather than innovation. "A 
unique place like SOM doesn't come 
along 
very often," 
said 
Berg. 
"Personally, I feel that another tradi-
tional business school is the last thing 
this world needs."
