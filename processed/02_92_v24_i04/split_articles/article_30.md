rebuild the department." 

Lase semester, the administration 
began an attempt to restore the depart-
ment's prestige. In one grand gesture, it 
tried to recruit five nationally acclaimed 
professors from top universities. The 
list, compiled by a panel of 100 
philosophers from around the country, 
included Peter Rail ton and Adam Coke 
from Michigan, Barry Stroud and Sam 
Scheffler from Berkeley, and Scott 
Soames from Princeton. 

The move has sparked mixed reac-
tions from faculty and students. 
Because the group includes only ana-
lytic philosophers, some students com-
plain that their appointment would 
make the department lopsided. "The 
administration has neglected the dis-
tinguishing trend of Yale's philosophy 
department: that it represents a variety 
of viewpoints," said one philosophy 
major. 

Most professors and students sup-
port the administration's attempts to 
restore the department but criticize the 
snail-like pace of its efforts. Although 
Yale has sene out feelers to its recruits, 
none has received final offers. "The 
administration is moving much too 
slowly in the right direction," said 
Blanchette. In the meantime, the 
administration risks losing its recruits. 
According to Wagner, Yale's success in 
wooing the recruits hinges on its 
promise to each that several of the oth-
ers will accept as well. Already one 
professor has declined Yale's offer. 

While big-name tenured profes-
sors may elude Yale's grasp, the depart-
ment has successfully attracted top-
notch junior faculry. This year, five 
new assistant professors, elected from a 
pool of over 100 applicants, joined the 
philosophy 
department: 
Lisa 
Downing, Michael Della Rocca, lrad 
Kimhi, Gyula Klima, and Paolo 
Mancosu. They hail from the nation's 
best programs at Harvard, Stanford, 
Berkeley, Pittsburgh, and Princeton. 
"The junior faculty are not just bright 
and engaged but also philosophically

diverse and broadminded," said one 
professor. "A group like that could 
really promote philosophy at Yale." 

J
unior faculty cite light teaching 
loads, good research conditions, 
and stellar undergraduates as Yale's 
greatest strengths. So far, departmental 
unrest has not kept people away. 
"People are still coming, t<> the sur-
prise of some," said assistant professor 
Randall Havas. But to junior faculty 
who have worked at Yale for a few 
years, the problems loom large. "No 
one is going to take the first bus out of 
town," said Havas. "But they might 
take the first bus to a decent alterna-
. , 
tlve. 

Because of Yale's highly selective 
tenure process, junior professors know 
that their days here are probably num-
bered. "We're here for a good time, not 
for a long time," said Schmidtz. To 
philosophy professors, the university's 
reluctance to tenure junior faculty and 
its insistence on published work seems 
particularly unfair. Because of the 
nature of the discipline, few philoso-
phers publish substantial work until 
their later years. Yale, however, looks 
especially hard at a candidate's first 
book before it awards tenure. "None 
of the great philosophers, past or pre-
sent, would be considered for tenure

According to Yale's current policy," said 
one junior faculty member. 

Despite the instability and tenure 
disputes, some undergraduates still have 
words of praise for their department. 
'Tm more chan satisfied with the 
major," says Quin Smith (DC '93). 
Undergradua-tes laud the department 
for its small seminar sizes, the high qual-
ity of visiting and junior faculty, and its 
accessible DUS. "It's easy to gee into 
seminars, which means chat you can 
make good, close concaccs with profes-
sors," said jeremy Fields (DC '93). 

Still, undergraduates charge chat 
the lack of continuity shortchanges 
their philosophy education. Although 
the blue book lists 46 philosophy 
courses, their subject matter does not 
always cover a broad range of top-
ics. "Courses appear for one term, 
never to appear again," said Isaac 
Wheeler (CC '93). "There's no natural 
follow-up, and no core of courses that 
are always taught." Majors cite a 
-
paucity of course offerings in Eastern, 
African, feminist, and Medieval phil-
osophy. 

Philosophy students also sense 
departmental discord, and some feel 
caught in the cross fire. "When you go 
co professors, much of their talk seems 
to center around the plight of the 
department," said one student. "The 
department's deterioration has eaten 
away at the philosophical spirit of the 
faculty and students." 

Until Yale either attracts outside 
professors or awards tenure to some of 
its junior faculty, the department wiJI 
remain in limbo. "We're all disap-
pointed in some respects," said 
Wagner. "The rebuilding is a difficult 
process. We would like it to be quick 
and easy, but it takes hard work and 
time to rebuild a department." 

In the meantime, philosophy stu-
dents take what they can from the 
department. "I'll certainly be able to 
graduate with a decem degree in phi-
losophy," said Wheeler. " But I'm 
jumping off a sinking ship."
