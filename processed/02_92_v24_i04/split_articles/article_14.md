American studies. "Initially, they came in saying they want-
ed 15 percent cut from the budget. The committee decided 
that would be totally intolerable, and we said so." After con-
siderable debate, the committee convinced the administra-
tion to endorse a reduction of 10.7 percent. 


Over months of meetings, the committee members 
underwent an intensive education on the condition ofYale's 
academic departments, conducting interviews with depart-
ment chairs and outside experts. The meetings transformed 
their attitudes coward the issues involved with restructuring. 
According co one committee member, "We arrived at con-
clusions that none of us would have anticipated at the out-
set." 


The committee agreed co concentrate the cuts in the 
weaker departments, but differed strongly with Turner over 
which ones to axe. Although they carne to a consensus on 
cutting linguistics and operations research, several commit-
tee members said they would not want to teach at a univer-
sity without sociology or engineering. While few who 
served on the committee would speak on the record on this 
topic, Jaynes acknowledged, "There are departments still in 
existence as of this report that wouldn't have been if the ini-
tial viewpoint of che provost had gone through." 


Faculty members worried that the committee, com-
posed of professors hand-picked by the president and the 
provost, would rubber-stamp the administration's agenda. 
Many of those tapped for che committee had served on 
Yale's Budget Committee and consequently might look on 
cuts more favorably. The committee's recommendations, 
however, assuaged the fears of most professors. Many seem 
to agree with the opinion of committee member Richard 
Brodhead: "The report does not represent anybody's parry 
line. This is the work of a lot of independent-minded peo-
ple working in the face of unpleasant necessity." 


Indeed, the committee included outspoken critics of 
university policy like Jaynes, who recently wrote an unfa-
vorable report on Yale's minority hiring practices. "I did not

see·the committee as puppets of the 
president or the provost, n said Jaynes. 
"In fact, one of the reasons I agreed to 
serve on the committee was its compo-
sition. It was clear to me that they had 
chosen strong individuals." 


The fact that the administration 
gave professors a limited but substan-
tial role in the restructuring process 
represents a major victory for the fac-
ulty. According to Kagan, "There 
has never been a subject of this sig-
nificance in which the faculty has 
had as much involvement." In the 
70s, the two committees that consid-
ered proposals to reduce the number 
of Yale professors had no faculty rep-
resentation at all. In 1978, a commit-
tee of four administrators proposed 
cutting Yale's faculty by ten per-
cent-a reduction that was never 
fully implemented because of the 
booming economy of the 80s. 


While the current restructuring 
committee may be Yale's most demo-
cratic yet, some professors believe 
that the fundamental problem was 
the committee's narrow agenda. As 
Yale cuts programs in response to 
deficits, it is adding new courses with 
recently acquired gifts. The adminis-
tration handed the committee the axe 
to shape the cuts, but left discretion 
over new programs for itself. "There 
is a kind of de facto restructuring 
going on," said Michael Denning, 
American studies professor. "We no 
longer have linguistics; we have Bass 
Western civilization. It wasn't even 
part of the charge of the committee 
to think about. Can anyone with $20 
million come in and decide what our 
educational priorities are?" 


With no formal restructuring 
plan, the administration alone evalu-
ates the needs of the university. The 
Development Office uses a list of pri-
orities set by the Provost's Office 
when it solicits donors. This so-
called "shopping list" serves as the 
university's academic blueprint. 


"Very often what donors want to do

when they come to talk to us doesn't 
line up with the priorities that the 
community has embraced. So it is 
our task to persuade people from 
whatever their original idea was to 
something that is a higher priority 
for us," said Terry Holcombe (SY 
'64), vice president for Development 
and Alumni Affairs. 


T
he Committee issued its 
report at the midpoint of a 
year that began with intense 
hostility between the faculty and the 
administration, a year that may end 
in a transformation of university 
power relations. Many faculty mem-
bers blame Dean Kagan in particular 
for their increasingly contentious 
relationship with the administration. 
As dean, they say, Kagan has played 
the role of partisan rather than mod-
erator. 


Kagan damaged his standing 
with the faculty early on. Over facul-
ty protests, the dean implemented 
the Kagan-Pollitt plan, which radi-
cally changed graduate education at 
Yale. The plan limited the time stu-
dents could spend in graduate pro-
grams to six years and capped the 
number of positions for teaching 
assistants. "It is unfortunate that facul-
ty suspicion and alienation, bred 
by certain administration actions in 
recent years, should have created the 
atmosphere in which the restructur-
ing report is being received," said one 
department chair. 


Yale's 
governing 
structure 
allowed the administration to impose 
the Kagan-Pollitt plan without facul-
ty consent. The university invests 
almost complete authority over aca-
demic programs and spending priori-
ties in the hands of four administra-
tors-the president, the provost, the 
dean ofYale College, and the dean of 
the Graduate School. Faculty have 
relied on what can no longer be 
called their "good faith" relationship 
with the administration for the pro-
tection of their interests. "What is 
unprecedented is not the high-hand-
edness of the provost and the dean," 
said Denning, "but that their vision 
is at such odds with the larger part of 
the faculty." 


Faculty trust in the administra-
tion, and in Kagan especially, 
reached its nadir last fall when an 
article the dean wrote for the journal 
Academic Questiom circulated among 
professors. In the piece, Kagan char-
acterized Yale's hum:tnities faculty as, 
among other things, "a bunch of 
funny guys." He seemed to disparage 
the faculty repeatedly with state-
ments like: "Consider what a cor~ 
[curriculum} constructed by the cur-
rent faculty would look like, and the 
consequence that would ensue if 
they also had the responsibility of 
teaching it." Kagan explained that he 
believed most Yale professors would 
not be qualified to teach his concep-
tion of a core curriculum because 
most of the faculty do not believe in 
the centrality of Western civilization. 


The full Faculty of Arts and 
Sciences packed Linsly-Chittenden 
1 0 1 to debate Kagan's article last fall. 
Professors lined up to give speeches 
denouncing the dean's views while 
he responded to their criticism. The 
faculty seemed relieved to get 
Kagan's ear and aired their grievances 
w~th the administration's policies. By 
the estimate of one professor at the 
meeting, over 90 percent of the 
speakers criticized Kagan. Many who 
spoke accused him of violating the 
"good faith" relationship between 
the faculty and the administration. 


During the course of the debate, 
many realized for the first time their 
powerlessness in the university's 
administrative structure. 


Reflecting on the experience, 
Kagan defiantly stands by his state· 
ments. "I expressed some views 
which I think are correct and that 
offend some of my colleagues," said 
Kagan. "They proceeded to tell me 
fEBRUARY 7• 1991 


what they thought of my views, which 
I think is a very fine exchange." 


In the wake of the meeting, many 
participants formed a committee to 
investigate ways for the faculty to 
influence administrative decisions. 
Some professors formed an explorato-
ry committee that will nominate facul-
ty members to a group called the 
Committee on Governance. They will 
study other universities for models of 
integrating faculty opinion into the 
decision-making process. 


Even those professors who respect 
the work of the Restructuring 
Committee believe that the way the 
committee was selected exemplifies 
Yale's autocratic power structure. 
Members of the committee and the 
administration counter that it would 
have been impossible for Yale's large 
and diverse faculty to reach a consen-
sus on cutting any departments. 


Faculty concerns are not diminished 
by Kagan's response to their fears. "I 
could not imagine an effective way of


How bad is the deficit? 
The -white Paper/ issued by Provost 
Frank Turner in December, projects that 
the deficit will grow to $101 .2 million 
by the year 2000 if earning and spend-
ing continue along their current paths. 
Yale financed its $8.8 million deficit for 
the 1991 -92 academic year with 
money from the unrestricted reserves 
fund. Years of relying on this "'cushion" 
fund leave it with only $264,000. 


Where is the deficit? 
Yale's operating budget totals $799 
million, but the deficit occurs only in the 
$265 million portion for generol appro-
priations. Funds allocated for specific 
PI'Oiects, programs, and facilities, such 
as research grants for the School of 
Medicine or the endowment for the 
~sh Art Center, comprise the remain-
•ng $534 million of the budget. This 
part of the balance sheet is, in fact, bal-
anced.

involving the faculty more than the 
one we did," said Kagan. "Shall we 
have an Athenian assembly where you 
put the citizenry up on a hill and have 
a debate on every point? That is mad-
ness!" 


While few professors seek a vote 
by the full citizenry on every restruc-
turing decision, many believe that the 
administration should have incorpo-
rated at least some democratic princi-
ples into the process. "There was no 
opportunity for dialogue," said sociol-
ogy's Davis. "There should have been 
an open and far-reaching debate on 
the crisis of the university and our 
vision for the 21st century. The under-
lying intellectual and scholarly issues 
should have been addressed." 


The restructuring report may 
soon provide a crucial test for the new 
faculty sentiment for self-governance. 
Members of the restructuring commit-
tee believe that their report is merely a 
recommendation to the administra-
tion and that faculty debate will play 
an essential part in the process. "The 
restructuring committee sees this as a 
report which the faculty is to com-
ment on," said Jaynes. "Our belief is 
that it is not set in stone." 


While Kagan and Turner have 
scheduled faculty meetings on the 
committee's proposals, both men 
believe that the Yale Corporation will 
almost certainly adopt the committee's 
report in full. "We are very unlikely to 
undertake a policy that is different 
than what is recommended by this 
committee," said Kagan. Turner, in an 
interview with the Yal~ Daily N~ws, 
made similar comments. With a facul-
ty debate scheduled for Febuary 13, 
the Yale community will know soon 
whether the university has begun to 
move toward the model of the 
Athenian assembly or that of its suc-
cessor, the oligarchy.
