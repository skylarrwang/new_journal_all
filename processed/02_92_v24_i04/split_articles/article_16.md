Paying Science Hill's Bill

t spring, a federal auditor investi-
ating Stanford University won-
ered why the school included a 
19th century fruitwood commode, 
chauffeurs for the president's wife, and 
flowers for the presidential mansion on 
its bill for government-funded scientific 
research. His report exploded into a 
national scandal. In the weeks that fol-
lowed, the government accused the uni-
versity of overcharges amounting to more 
than $300 million over the last nine 
years, and Stanford president Donald 
Kennedy resigned in disgrace. 

In the wake of these disclosures, the 
House Subcommittee on Oversight and 
Investigations conducted an exhaustive 
search into the fate of the ll billion fed-
eral dollars granted annually to scientific 
research. The Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) audited 14 
research universities, including Yale, and 
found inappropriate charges at all of 
them. 

At Yale, auditors questioned the 
school's use of research funds for items 
such as part of the cost of the memorial 
service for Kingman Brewster and flow-
ers for the recipients of long-term service

indirect costs. For the last four years, the 
game." 

The research money controversy 
hinges on "indirect costs," money that 
the federal government pays uruveJ'Sities 
to cover all the details that go into the 
cost of scientific research. Libraries, 
administrative salaries, utilities and cus-
todial services all fall under this heading. 
In reaction to the scandal at Stanford

versiry would lose more than $10 million 
a year. Since the current operating budget 
at Yale carries an $8.8 million deficit, such 
a forced reduction would more than dou-
ble the univei'Siry's budget woes. 

In the race for grant money, compe-
tition is fierce. According to Brown, the 
bleak climate in the scientific community 
imposes a stifling form of artificial 
selection upon researchers ... People are 
less likely to undertake risky proposals 
because they know they won't get 
funded," said Brown. "The current 
atmosphere selects for pedestrian, safe

projects, the sort of solid, short-term 
projects that get by reviewers, not the 
risky projects that might really be 
exciting."
