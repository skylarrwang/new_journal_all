ized in. If you say yes to that, then you 
say no to something else. In times of 
prosperity, you have to make these 
decisions as well. When you don't, 
that's part of how you get yourself into 
trouble. 

I'm impressed that Yale's decisions 
are based on sound scholarly and intel-
lectual considerations. We'll continue 
to do things that lose money, mainly 
because they are important. There are 
areas in which the university must be 
active or else it would re-define itself. 
Yale has identified those areas and is 
committed to staying active in those 
areas, even if they lose money. 
Sara Suleri, English 

If we have fewer faculty and fewer 
graduate students teaching, we run the 
risk of dispensing with what I regard as 
a luxury of undergraduate education at 
Yale-the seminars-where there is 
lllaximum contact between faculty and 
students. On the research level, if indi-
vidual faculty members are going to 
teach one-third more students than 
they do now, that will obviously affect 
the work they do themselves. 

I feel that the report is going to pit 
departments against one another. 
Departments will be fighting for their 
own turf. We're presented with a list of 
the various cuts, and it becomes 
almost humanly inevitable to say "x 
only lost three, why did we lose five?" I 
certainly feel that it is very divisive on 
a departmental level and does not 
address the critical question of inter-
disciplinary programs at this institu-
tion. In my department, we've always 
been generous in sending faculty out 
"[Departments wiLL say] X only lost thru, 
why did we lou five?m 
to work in interdisciplinary programs. 
If our faculty is cut and theTA assis-
tance is cut, we won't be able to enact 
the interdisciplinary programs that we 
want to see on campus. These pro-
grams are important because they are 
part of the vibrancy with which the 
departments are in dialogue with one 
another. I know I'm speaking for many 
of the faculty in artS and sciences when 
I speak of my regret that the report 
compartmentalizes the departments 
and does not consider the university as 
a community that represents a whole. 
Melvin Ely, History and African-
American Studies 

The cuts seem typical of things 
that are happening in a lot of places. 
The cutbacks affect the way people 
who are here feel about their work, 
and how people outside look at Yale, 
and in that way, they can have an 
effect beyond what the pure numbers 
indicate. Yet these things are happen-
ing in so many places that it is hard to 
say whether the restructuring will 
affect Yale's competitiveness. 

My understanding is that the fac-
ulty positions will be cut back while 
the student body remains at the same 
size or even grows a bit. That bothers 
me, partly because I see the precursor 
"The faculty wiO be cut back while the student 
body remains the same siu. • 
to that in the history department. We 
already have too many students to give 
each the time and energy that he or 
she deserves. Restructuring may make 
that problem more widespread. The 
amount of teaching that graduate stu-
dents do is being cue back, yet there is 
no decrease in the demand for TAs, 
and in theory the cutbacks in faculty 
will increase that demand. Either of 
chose trends would cause tensions. 
The two of them in concert will cause 
even greater problems.

I believe that Yale ten years from 
now will not be very different from the 
Yale I've known over the last 23 years. 
We have been up and down with good 
times and hard times, and through all 
that it still seems to me to be the same 
Yale. 

I can't see how anyone who 
looks at the hard information could 
come away without the conclusion 
that we are in difficult budgetary 
times. It would be wise of us not to 
encourage false pessimism, however; 
we shouldn't be poisoning the well

we are all going to live in. It is per-
fectly all right to criticize the plan-
you could even say the people chat 
proposed it are a bunch of fools. But 
I think it is harmful, unwise, and 
unjustified to say that chis plan will 
have disastrous results. Nobody 
knows that. 

On the foture of mginuring: 
Engineering was studied very carefully 
by the 12 senior faculty members on the 
oommittee. The people who knew best on 
our committee judged that if we simply cur, 
then what was lefi: would not be tenable, so 
we had not only to rut but to reorganize. If I 
had my way engineering would be a lot big-
ger. But we did what we had to do. My per-
sonal opinion is that we have a fighting 
chance to produa: a good engineering pro-
gram of the kind we can sustain at Yale.

In the biological sciences, the cutbacks 
will have little direct dfect. Since the medical 
school is so close to us, we'll be OK I do 
think che cutbacks will make us education-
ally more oonservative--cutbacks will airnp 
going out in new directions. We won't have 
the financial resources to renew ourselves by 
investing in new educational ventures, 
which are desperately needed. I think char 
Yale isn't paying attention to critical prob-
lems in our wodd today. World ovopopula-
tion is the paramount issue, and basi· 
cally, Yale doesn't deal with it. Another 
issue is the destruction of the environ· 
menc. Given the explosion of biologi· 
cal knowledge, the biology and 
MB&B depaitments put their mont)' 
into molecular biology, which is where 
the big advances have been happening for 
the p3st twenty ycus. !bat lefi: no resowt:CS 
to be put coward researching the destn..tctioll 
of the environment. New money came ill 
for this from the Bass brothers to establish 


the biosphere insriruce, which may evmrual-
ly address this issue. That's a good example 
of how with new money you can gee 
involved in new vencures. Bur when you're 
rutting back you can't do that. 

I'm sorry co see the recrenchmenc in 
engineering because it mortgages the long-
term hope co rebuild New Haven. 
ledmology builds around big science and 
engineering universities. Yale scarced up 
Science Parle to ay co gee high-ccch employ-
ers into the city. It's been a struggle bur it's 
had some sucx:rsses. If we lose the engineer-
ing faculty, we lose the actraaiveness for that 
kind ofindusay to move here.

As a third-year graduate student, I 
view the recently proposed restructuring 
plan as part of a broader pattern of recent 
administrative decisions char gravely 
threaten the quality of education at Yale. 
As a Yale-trained scholar, I am conscious 
of the fact char any lasting damage co 
Yale's academic reputation affoct:s me pro-
fessionally. I am also aware that while 
other universities are considering faculty 
~uaions, no institution ofYale's reputa-
tion and resources has attempted any-
thing Like the cutbacks currently being 
proposed h~ Had I realized before com-
ing to Yale with what ease the administra-
tion puts "bankbooks before textbooks," I 
might have chosen to attend another 
graduate school

Rog~rs Smith, Political Scimu 

I think the restructuring wiU affect 
Yale's fate as a a:nter of research more dra-
matically than it will undergraduate teach-
ing. We are cutting back faculty even 
though many of Yale's departments are 
already smaller than their counterparts at 
other major reseaoch universities. It will be 
difficult to attract top research scholars to 
Yale when we don't have the positions avail-
able, and it will be harder for the depart-
ments themselves to excel when they don't 
have the sheer number of excdJent research 
scholars chat our competitors have. For 
instance, if Harvard has 1.5 political scien-
tists for every political scientist at Yale, then 
evm ifYales political scientists are very good. 
Harv:mi will inevitably have a higher profile 
in the profession. It will be rough for every 
Yale political scientist to equal or excel every 
1.5 Harv.ud political scientists. 

The faa char sociology is being an so 
severely will have harmful repercussions for 
Yale's social sciences in general. People in 
other social science disciplines will think of 
Yale as not a very good place for them. 
When we're cutting back a laxge number of 
places, that is one of a number of factors thar 
raises the question of whedler Yale can cx>n-
cinue to compete ro be first. Yale isn't going 
ro dedine ow:might. but it will have diffia.d-
ty attrac:cing excdlent: research scholars in the 
future.
