From the perspective of individual 
scientists, a drive to lower indirect 
cost rates would make grant money 
easier to obtain. The more a grant costs, 
the harder it is to get. Unlike state 
schools, which can use tax dollars to 
defray some of their indirect costs, pri-
vate schools like Yale depend on funds 
from the federal government to finance 
their programs. '~t a private school with 
high rates, researchers are at a competi-
tive disadvantage to state schools where 
the rates are lower," said biology professor 
Charles Brown. "If the same amount of 
money is available and less goes to indi-
rect COSts, more research can be funded." 
Still, if the government reduced 
recovery rates Yale could no longer afford 
to provide its current level of services. 
"For my own research interests I'd like to 
favor lower rates," said physics professor 
Thomas Applequist. "But if I think insti-
tutionally, I share the concerns of the 
administration about the damage that a 
forced reduction would have." 
Donald Crothers, professor of 
chemistry and molecular biology and 
biophysics, believes that universities 
not only spend more to support 
research than they receive from the 
government but also have suffered 
unjustly in the aftermath of the scan-
dal. "Our research universities are 
under completely unwarranted 
attack," said Crothers. "My overall 
feeling is that the universities are 
underpaid for the cost of research. 
The disputed funds are somehow 
regarded as a tremendous expense 
when they support the finest research 
universities in the world." 
Unfortunately, scientists may be 
pinched between Yale's budget crisis 
and pressures to downsize from the 
federal government. For science at 
Yale to flourish, it needs both first-
class research and the resources to 
support it. While lower indirect rates 
could make it easier for individual 
scientists to obtain grants, the quality 
of life on Science Hill would suffer. 
With lower recovery rates, either ser-
vices will deteriorate or Yale will have 
to draw funds from other areas of the 
budget 
to 
maintain 
them. 
"Someone's got to cover the indirect 
costs of science," said Wyman. 
"Someone's got to mow the grass." ...
