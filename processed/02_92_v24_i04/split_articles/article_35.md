Reflections on the Future 

n an atmosphere of academic anxi-
ety, Th~ N~w journaL wanted to 
give professors and graduate stu-
dents a chance to speak directly on the 
topic of Yale's future. We asked mem-
bers of the Yale community what they 
thought about the restructuring com-
mittee's recommendations. We present 
their thoughts on the present and their 
concerns and hopes for the future. 

"Th~r~ isn't much of a spirit of an in~­
disciplinary approach. "

The restructuring report gives no 
sense that the world is any different 
today than it was 50 years ago. I think 
that the world has changed very radi-
cally in the last few years-with the 
end of the Cold War and with a grow-
ing recognition of the complex envi-
ronmental, sociological and economic 
problems that the human race faces on 
this planet. This is one of those 
moments when universities have to do 
more than restructure-they have to 
rethink their relationship to the world. 

My response after reading the report a 
couple of times was that it is confined 
to analyzing Yale within the little boxes 
of departments. Interdisciplinary pro-
grams are an after-thought. There isn't 
much of a spirit of an interdisciplinary 
approach. 

It's hard to say what the implica-
tions will be for undergraduate educa-
tion. The report discusses languages 
not in terms of their inherent impor-
tance, but in terms of savings that 
co'uld be made in the teaching staffs. 
It's hard for me to understand why 
things as essential to undergraduate 
education as languages and expository 
writing get brushed off.

Contact between faculty and stu-
dents has been an essential part of a 
Yale education. I don't see how that 
kind of education will be possible if 
the plan to restructure includes 
decreasing faculty while at the same

time not decreasing the number of stu-
dents admitted. Undergraduates won't 
have the same kind of individual con-
tact with professors. 

Another concern I have relates to 
the basis on which departments will 
make decisions about which faculty 
positions to cut. Cutting faculty posi-
tions forces the departments and the 
university ro confront hard issues 
about what is essential and what is a 
luxury in a college curriculum. Will 
the French department or the English 
department give up the people who 
work on feminism? Departments may 
decide that they need the "basics," and 
therefore cut the not so-called basics. 
What's going to prevent that from 
happening?

No single university can do every-
thing. There are too many planets and 
stars to teach about each of them. 
There are too many languages to offer 
courses in all of them. There are too 
many periods of history for one uni-
versity to encompass. A university has 
to decide if it is going to try to do 
everything, or if it is going to try to do 
fewer things well. The commitment of 
a research university is that the latter is 
where you start, and then you see how 
broad an encompassment you can gee. 

It's very important for universities 
to engage in a much more self-critical 
review than they usually do. It's sad 
that they tend to do so only in times of 
financial constraint. You make a 
choice every time a professor leaves. 
You have to decide whether you go on 
doing whatever that professor special-
