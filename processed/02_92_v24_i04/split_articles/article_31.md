M
ost of the students who rent 
houses on Mansfield Street, 
a quiet, tree-lined avenue 
that runs opposite Ingalls Rink, chose 
the area because of its roomy old hous-
es and its residential feel. "It's a little 
bit off the main drag," explained resi-
dent Jason Barbeau (TO '92). 

"Walking or biking up the street dur-
ing the daytime, it's just like you're liv-
ing in a 
neighborhood." 

Last 
September, however, Barbeau realized 
that his street wasn't as idyllic as he'd 
thought. After five guests left a party at 
his house, two men robbed them at 
knifepoint on Mansfield. 

The multiple mugging was only 
one of a series of robberies that 
plagued 
Mansfield 
throughout 
September. By mid-semester, students 
who rented houses there referred to 
their neighborhood half-jokingly as 
"Manslaughter Street." "It was dis-
tinctly scary," recalled resident Perry 
de Valpine OE '93). 

Fear lingers among Mansfield resi-
dents, but crime itself has declined sig-
nificantly around the area in recent 
months, thanks to the efforts of both 
the Yale and New Haven Police 
Departments. Not only did each 
department take new measures to pre-
vent crime on Mansfield, but in a 
promising step towards town-gown 
cooperation, the two departments 
have formed a joint task force to fight 
crime in and around Yale. These mea-
sures, 
combined with security 
improvements that the Yale Secretary's 
office has ordered, seek to make Yale 
an island of safety in a turbulent urban 
sea. "Crime is up everywhere in urban 
)0 THE NEW jOURNAL 
environments," said Marci Sternheim, 
assistant secretary of the university. 
"Crime is down on the Yale campus, 
however. This is a much more secure 
place than people would lead you to 
believe." 

Yale not only has tightened secu-
rity for its on-campus students bur 
has intensified joint efforts with New 
Haven to ensure the safety of those 
who live off-campus. Mansfield Street 
proved an excellent setting for an 
exercise in cooperation, since it falls 
under the jurisdictions of both the 
Yale and New Haven police. Yale 
owns several houses on Mansfield, 
and Yale Police responds to calls at all 
buildings the university owns and 
manages. "If the house is owned by 
Yale but managed by someone else, 
the calls are handled by the New 
Haven Police," said Yale Police 
Commander James Perrotti. "But we 
listen to New Haven dispatch calls, 
"Crime is down on 
the Yale campus. 
This is a much more 
secure place than 
people would lead 
you to believe. , 
and if there's a robbery on the street 
they'll call Yale police and we'll 
respond together. Obviously we don't 
just cover what belongs to Yale." 

The Yale and New Haven police 
departments formed a joint task force 
to cut down on crime around Yale on 
September 26, at the height of 
Mansfield's mini-crime wave. For rwo 
weeks, teams from each department 
patrolled the area &om Mansfield an4 
Sachem streets to Wall and High 
streets. Tense Mansfield residents felt 
reassured by the undercover vehicle 
that conspicuously cruised their street. 
"We felt very safe," recalled de 
Valpine. But in early October, when 
police nabbed a man suspected of sev-
eral robberies around the Yale campus, 
the force disbanded. 

According to Dean Esserman, 
assistant chief of the New Haven 
Police Department, such temporary 
Yale-New Haven police collaborations 
have long been common practice. 
"When problems occurred, the forces 
came together on an incident-by-inci-
dent basis, staging joint stakeouts until 
we caught the guy," he said. In early 
October, just as the temporary task 
force finished up its work, Yale and 
New Haven took steps to make their 
cooperation both more formal and 
more regular. The two departments 
formed a permanent task force to syn-
chronize law enforcement efforts 
around 
Yale 
and 
downtown. 
"Basically, we said, 'Look, we're polic-
ing the same area; let's get together and 
talk about it,'" said Esserman. The 
departments now share the same radio 
frequency, so that each hears the 
other's calls as a matter of course. "The 
feedback I've been getting is that coop-
eration has never been better," said 
Esserman.
