raditionally, Yale and New Haven have quarreled 
rather than cooperated. Yet both the city and the 
university insist that tough times have forced them 
to forge a new partnership stronger than any in Yale's histo-
ry. As joint development projects between town and gown 
proliferate, however, New Haven demands more. Yale's hes-
itancy to commit its resources to the city irks community 
leaders. "In order to save neighborhoods at risk, you've got 
to risk something yourself," said Peter Gray, president of the 
Dixwell Community Development Corporation. Although 
Yale and New Haven have discovered similar aspirations of 
security and stability, they have yet to build a working rela-
tionship. 

Yale views its involvement in New Haven as secondary 
to its educational mission. Concerned with training minds 
to recognize general truths, the university rarely p10vides

practical solutions for the social and economic problems 
New Haven faces. Pursuing Yale's academic enterprise also 
necessitates financial caution. "One of the investment com-
mittee's duties is essentially not to waste the assets of the 
Corporation," said Susan Godshall, assistant secretary of the 
university. "We're looking for investments-we're not a 
cha.ritable institution. We need to ensure that we will have 
the funds to go on teaching." 

Some community leaders feel that Yale's concern with 
its financial stability overrides its consideration for the city's 
welfare. The university made investments at regular market 
rates in its joint development projects with New Haven. "In 
essence, Yale's commitment to invest in New Haven is a 
commitment to do what it does anywhere else-make 
money," said James Farnam (TC '73), a partner at the New 
Haven-based consulting firm Holt, Wexler and Merchant. 

A little-known component of the 1990 Yale-New 
Haven agreement, however, seeks to put the university's 
intellectual and financial capital to New Haven's direct ben-
efit. Over the next five years, Yale will contribute a total of

$250,000 to help establish a Center for the City. Drawing 
on the faculty and staff of Yale, City Hall, and other univer-
sities in the area, the Center aims to study problems of 
poverty, education, and developmem in New Haven. The 
Center not only will propose solutions but also will help 
raise funds to turn proposals imo active programs. 

But the Center remains in its planning stages. In the 
meantime, policy makers have suggested that Yale help 
boost the city economy by purchasing more goods and sup-
plies from local merchants. At present, Yale buys less than 
10 percent of its goods from New Haven suppliers. 

According to Godshall, the sheer volume of Yale's needs 
rnakes purchasing in New Haven impractical. Yale 
University Dining Halls, for example, buys more orange 
juice than all the wholesalers in New Haven combined. The 
university spends nearly $1.5 million a year co buy 36,000

Administrators argue that Yale's considerable non-
E: financial contributions to New Haven go largely unnoticed. 
~ "We don't publish a big, thick, glossy report saying 'My, 
~ look at all the wonderfUl things Yale's doing for the commu-
j nity, "' Godshall said. "It's not Yale's way." In its publication 
''Economic Impact: Yale and New Haven," the Secretary's 
Office did include pictures of the Yale-sponsored Special 
Olympics, the DEMOS science tutoring program and vari-
ous initiatives that draw attention to Yale's commitment to 
New Haven welfare. 

Some, however, sense a certain duplicity in Yale's asser-
tions of wide community involvement. Although the uni-
versity takes credit for student volunteers and their contri-
butions to the life of the city, Yale provides almost no fman-
cial support to campus community-service organizations 
like Dwight Hall. Aside from one salaried position and 
maintenance and heating costs for the building, Dwight 
Hall receives no money from Yale. 

"A great deal of Dwight Hall's time is devoted to fUnd-
raising," said Josh Wallack (MC '93), former financial coor-
dinator of the Dwight Hall cabinet. "Meanwhile Yale gets 
all the PR from student work." Many students feel that they 
volunteer in New Haven despite Yale, not because of it. 
Without the burden of fUndraising, students could concen-
trate on developing and extending opportunities for com-
munity work. As Wallack suggested, "Community service is 
an incredible education. It's a pretty ridiculous and near-
sighted vision of education not to support it." 

Yale's wealth, size, and influence, some believe, allow 
it to ignore the needs of its neighbors. In the Hill neigh-
borhood, for example, Yale's continual construction of 
new buildings irritates community leaders. 
"The 
Hospital and the Medical School love to expand," said 
Angel Fernandez, assistant director of the Hill 
Development Corporation (HOC), a community group 
that oversees projects that affect Hill residents. "We're 
here to try to stop or try to control that expansion." Yale 
must get the approval of the HOC before constructing 
buildings in the Hill.
