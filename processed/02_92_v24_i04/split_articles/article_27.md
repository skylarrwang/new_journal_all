**Forestry: A New Leaf**

In 1900, just before Teddy Roosevelt made conserva-
tion a national priority, Gifford Pinchot's family endowed 
the Yale Forest School. Pinchot (Yale 1889) was the first 
Chief Forester of the United States. The school originally 
trained professionals to work in the timber industry and in. 
the administration of federal and state forests. It also pro-
pounded a conservation ethic that Pinchot defined as "the 
wise use of the earth for the good of present and future gen-
erations." In the beginning, the curriculum focused solely 
on trees and how they grow. "Forestry is the management 
of forests for production of wood, water, wildlife, and recre-
ational benefits," Smith explained. 


As the environmental movement evolved, so did the 
Forestry School. By the 50s the school focused on long-term 
forest management. When students became increasingly 
interested in environmental management in the 60s and 70s, 
the school added Environmental Studies to its name and 
introduced the master's degree in that field to Yale. 


Throughout its history the school's emphasis on an 
interdisciplinary approach to the ecosystem as a whole has 
set it apart from programs at other universities. Students 
examine the interactions among various parts of the ecosys-
tem, like forest and marine systems, and between different 
academic disciplines, such as biology and economics. Anne 
Black (FOR '92) chose Yale because "the other schools 1

ronment works as a system." Graduates of the ForestrY 
School apply their interdisciplinary training to jobs in gov-
ernment agencies, watchdog groups, academic institutions, 
and industry. 


at a meeting of the North American Forestry 
Commission of the United Nations in the 1970s, 
he delegates sang the national anthems of each of 
the countries represented. When it came to the United 
States, Yale graduates so dominated the delegation that they 
sang the Whiffenpoof song rather than the "Star Spangled 
Banner." "There is no doubt that the school is a leader," 
said Forestry Dean John Gordon. "For the most part stu-
dents have chosen us over Duke and Michigan, our tradi-
tional competitors." 


As concern for the environment takes center stage on 
the international agenda, Yale's expertise in the field could 
prove more valuable than ever. "Environmental issues have 
become increasingly important in certain sectors-espe-
cially government agencies, non-government organizations 
and industry," said professor Steve Kellen. "Now the aca-
demic sector has to grow. There is a need for the Forestry 
School because academics can mediate between the other 
sectors." 


The increasing demand for environmental professionals 
means that the school cannot rest on its laurels. When 
Dean Gordon steps down in May after a ten-year tenure to 
concentrate on research and teaching, he will leave the 
school in transition. While applications to programs in 
forestry and environmental studies at other institutions 
have dropped, applications to Yale have risen from 132 to 
375 since 1986. Class size has grown from 54 to 98. And in 
the same period, the school has lost six senior faculty mem-
bers: four retired and two became deans at other institu-
tions. 


The changes are not limited to Yale-the environmen-
tal field as a whole has expanded and grown more complex. 
"A degree in environmental studies can be too general to 
open doors," said Jackie Prince, (PC '84, SOM and FOR 
'88). "In the past five years, there has been a trend in the 
job market that calls for people with expertise in a particular 
area." The school has always prided itself on its interdisci-
plinary nature and close-knit atmosphere. But in an era of 
environmental crises, the school must adapt to both 
changes in environmentalism and its own growth.
