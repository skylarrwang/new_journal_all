Twenty percent of the students come from foreign coun-
tries. "Even among the Americans there is a lot of imerna-
tional experience--the Peace Corps, non-government orga-
nizations," said Black. "The diversity allows much more in-
depth discussion of what's happening elsewhere in the 
world." The Tropical Resources Institute (TRI), which the 
Forestry School established in 1983 to allow students to 
focus on the management of tropical resources, reflects the 
school's growing interest in international environmental 
issues. TRI offers courses that explore tropical issues and 
provides internships and research projects in the field. 
The school also has turned irs attention to industrial 
environmental issues. Environmentalists can help compa-
nies reduce costs as they meet stricter government regula-
tions and the growing consumer demand for environmen-
tally safer products. Some specialises hope ro change harm-
ful industrial practices such as pollution and deforestation 
by working within the industrial system. The school 
recently developed the Industrial Environmental 
Management Program to equip its students for the rask and 
to bring businesspeople to the school for short courses in 
environmental management. 


W:
ile these programs allow students co focus rheir 
rudies on a particular issue or concentration, 
rudencs remain fairly free to design their own 
programs of study. The school offers three master's degrees: 
in Forestry, Forest Science, and Environmental Studies. 
Most students pursue the most general of these, the degree 
in Environmental Studies. Many now obtain joint degrees 
with another Yale graduate school, especially the School of 
Organization and Management. 


With so much flexibility, students run the risk of grad-
uating without any area of expertise. "The level of sophisti-
cation is increasing in environmental jobs so rhat well-
developed skills in areas such as engineering, economics, 
and science are becoming more valuable than a general 
degree," said Prince. Responding ro studem demand for 
gt'cater specialization, the school began to offer formal con-
centrations a few years ago. Now students may choose to


concentrate in conservation biology or 
water resources policy, or they may 
design their own concentration, such 
as international development and con-
servation. 


Some students fear that specializa-
tion will restrict the curriculum or nar-
row the disciplines at the school. "It's 
fine if someone wants to come in and 
elect to specialize, but if everyone was 
forced to do that it would do the 
school great harm," said Warren Byrne 
(FOR '92). "It's true that a special 
concentration looks good on a resume, 
but when it comes down to the work 
being done, an understanding of the 
environment as a whole and the rami-
fications for policy formation are 
essential. The great thing about Yale is 
that people are able to come here and 
be generalists." 


Administrators want to preserve 
the school's interdisciplinary nature as 
well. "The school is resisting depart-
mentalization," said assistant dean 
Gordon Geballe. "The interdisci-
plinary approach is the intellectual 
underpinning 
of 
the 
school. 
Unfortunately, this means that the 
school cannot be sufficiently deep in 
every area." Born to train foresters, 
the school maintains its commitment 
to terrestrial studies. For example, only 
one professor teaches water resources. 


w;
ile no graduate program 
an 
achieve 
sufficient 
epth in every department, 
some reorganization might cure the 
Forestry School's other headaches. 
The faculty crunch and burgeoning 
student body, along with a disintegrat-
ing physical plant, have provoked 
grumbles from students and professors 
alike. Students complain about poor 
faculty-student contact, competition 
among students, and inadequate phys-
ical space. "Professors are making a 
serious effort to make the numbers 
work-that includes limiting partici-
pation in certain classes, a move stu-
dents grudgingly accept," said Black. 


"Still, there's a lot of frustration with 
the pace at which faculty positions are 
being filled. The searches may be 
going as fast as possible, but it's still 
slow." 


Students and faculty hope that the 
choice of a new dean will solve the 
space problems and bring new life and 
direction to the school. 


"Long-range 
plans are on hold and waiting for the 
new dean," Black said. 


Undoubtedly, long-range plans 
will have to address the school's grow-
ing pains and developments within the 
environmental field. "The greatest 
challenge facing the school is how to 
grow with the increased interest in 
environmental issues without losing its 
cohesiveness and its abiliry to provide 
specific areas of study," said Leslee 
Sheeline (FOR '91). If it can build on 
its past successes and retain its ability 
to change with the times, the school 
will prove equal to the task.
