"The student body is over-
whelmed by the budget 
cuts," complained Martha 
Brockenbrough '92. "There have been 
protests regarding what has been axed, 
and people see the administration as a 
monolithic beast that remains unre-
sponsive 
to 
their complaints." 

Although Brockenbrough's observa-
tions accurately characterize the events 
of Yale's 1991 faU semester, they actu-
ally refer to her own experience at 
Stanford University. Like Yale, most 
colleges throughout the United States 
currently face budget deficits because 
of the country's weak economy. As 
financial aid requests and general costs 
rise, gift and investment income has 
shrunk. 

Yale seems positively wealthy com-
pared with Stanford. "The provost 
recently released a campus report in 
which he explained that we have a $95 
million 'budget problem,"' explained 
Jake Veylupek, a Stanford senior who 
works at the Office of Public Affairs. 
"While some of this resulted from the 
1989 earthquake repair costs, much of 
it comes from previous deficits and the 
decreased rate and volume of govern-
ment research." Stanford's problems 
with the federal government began 
when a 1990 audit revealed that the 
university had defrauded the govern-
ment of 300 million federal 
research dollars (see story page 
12). As a result of the inspection, 
the Office of Naval Research can-
celled all of its agreements with 
the university. The loss of ONR 
revenues aggravated budget 
problems that had begun even 
before the 1989 Lorna Prieta 
earthquake forced building repair 
COSts sky-high. 

Normally, Stanford derives 
about 12 percent of its operat-
ing income from endowment 
funds, so the remaining 88 per-
cent must come from the same 
tuition, research, and unrestrict-
ed gift monies that have contracted in 
the recession. Even in a good year, the 
income derived from these sources 
would fail to remedy the acute 
budget deficit, so Stanford 
plans to cut programs and 
administrative costs and slow its 
building repairs. 

While Stanford's extreme sit-
uation makes it stand out 
among prestigious universities, 
schools that are relatively 
healthy in comparison-like 
the University of Chicago-also 
face significant budget prob-
lems. "We planned to have a 
shortfall of about $2.5 million, 
and we're right on target," said 
University 
of 
Chicago 
spokesperson Bill Murphy. "Still, we 
can't go on running a deficit forever, 
even if it's a planned one." After years 
of letting such small shortfalls accrue, 
many universities have found them-
selves forced to tighten their belts and 
cut budgets during the recession. 

The size of a school's actual 
deficit often helps to determine 
what will be trimmed back or 
completely cut to save money. 
Duke University faces cuts in 
every department. "We are look-
ing at coming up $2 million short, 
so we're spreading cuts across the 
board and asking the individual 
departments to absorb certain per-
centages," said Duke spokesperson 
David Robertson. "Still, we're not 
in anything like the dire situation 
facing other schools. For instance, 
no sections, TAs, or faculty will be 
cut." While considering possible 
department mergers and removals, 
Stanford also pledged not to cut 
any of its teachers.
