nity to learn what experiences have informed opposing perspectives 
should be a valuable exercise. But one society member expressed his 
doubt that the message really sinks in. "All our life we've learned just 
to judge things on the surface," he told me, "and I think that's 
tough to break down in just a year."

the best affections of the heart, and the highest powers of

Mack describes how as the liberal arts were folded into Yale's acad-
emic curriculum, and as Scroll and Key became an established and 
wealthy institution, the function, if never the ideals or the rituals,

of the society changed. Scroll and Key began to fund aca-
demic prizes, scholarships, and contribute financially to 
Yale in other ways, establishing a pattern that other soci-
eties have followed. At the same time, the new curriculum 
of liberal arts a Ia cart~ was perceived as a threat to the 
holistic autodidacticism ofYale's 19TH century education. 
Scroll and Key perpetuated the older, gentlemanly intel-
could excel. There was a dear ladder of popularity and accom-
plishment that could be climbed, with Skull and Bones looming at 
the top and the other tomb societies just below. This, at least, is the 
caricature drawn by F. Scott Fitzgerald and by Owen Johnson in 
Stover at Yale. The "best men" began their senior years as leaders and 
strong characters on campus; they left as Bonesmen. 

But the origins of the secret society system belie both its cur-
rent appearance and the role it seems to have played in Yale's least 
democratic days. Skull and Bones was founded in 1832, and Scroll 
and Key a decade later. At the time, Yale's academic curriculum 
consisted mostly of classical languages, mathematics, and the phys-
ical sciences. The rest of a liberal education was extracurricular and 
largely student run, and the organs that provided it were the sopho-
more, junior, and senior societies, the debating and honors organi-
zations, and the private student libraries of Linonia and Brothers in 
Unity. It is unsurprising that this collegiate atmosphere produced 
exclusive senior societies dedicated to debate, fraternity, and intel-
lectual ideals. The original atmosphere of 
Bones and Keys was much more that of 
D~ad Poet's Soci~ty than the New World 
Order. 

Maynard Mack's History of Scro/J and 
Kry describes the heady idealism and the 
activities of those early days with more 
detail than one would expect in a text avail-
able to the public. Scroll and Key was a lit-
erary, dramatic, and debating society, where 
students declaimed original poetry and 
drank whisky punch in a rented room with 
velvet-draped walls. In his book, Mack 
quotes an extended passage from the pream-
ble to the society's constitution: 

The love of ideal beauty is the 
peculiar distinction of a noble 
mind; that it is wise therefore to 
cherish an enthusiasm for perfect 
forms of grace, whether seen in the 
works of literature, science, or

lectual culture and continued to instill its qualities in the 
changing student body. Building up the Society had given way to 
conserving a culture. 

The demographics of the societies, especially the oldest and 
best-established ones, never quite kept pace with those of the 
University. Until World War II, the societies were dominated by 
white students, mostly from prep-schools, often Yale and secret 
society legacies. By the late nineteen-sixties, though, most of the 
societies were swept up in the democratic spirit of the time-which 
Mack refers to as "the recent unpleasantness." They began to admit 
students of color and women. In the early 1990S, Skull and Bones 
and Wolf's Head were the last two major societies to go co-ed. But 
the hyper-diverse character of the societies today is recent and hard 
won-a fact still on the minds of minority students within them. 

The guidelines for choosing the next tap class differ from soci-
ety to society, but the taps have historically run through organiza-
tions. The editor of the Daily News might have been all but guar-
anteed a place in Skull and Bones for much of its history, but today
