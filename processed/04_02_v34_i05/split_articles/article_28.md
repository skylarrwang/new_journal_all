EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
He offers some tips for starting my 
new job. Tips, he reminds me, that will 
help me throughout my life. Like "Watch 
your appearance!," "In your aisle, gets a 
smile!," and "Nobody waits at Walgreens!" 
The Walgreens-specific video is set to a 
raucous rap sing-along beat. It's really old 
school. It's really old. Groups of flat-topped 
employees are smiling, and yelling things 
like "Worlcing at Walgreens is great!" in 
unison. An African man with gapped teeth 
admits with a smile, "But worlcing at 
Walgreens can be hard." I can see myself in 
the reflection of the television: a little too 
much hair, collared shirt recently pur-
chased at Sal's, moth-bitten cartoonish 
mod tie, khalcis too short. I doubt I'll ever 
get in a company video.

This week I'm in training, 9 AM to 3 PM. 
Then I start my graveyard shift, from 11 PM 
to 7 AM. Kay, a motherly woman in her 
early fifties, is training me today and 
tomorrow. 

Run it through the red light. Do it 
again until it beeps. Press Total when all the 
dom, diaper, and Dorito is in the front of 
its shelf space and at a ninety-degree angle. 
I face the items as fast as I can. 

Ah, new fish! 

When I finish, I ask Mr. Narichania 
what to do next. He thinks for a second. 
"Do it again, I guess." 

I get lonely here in the wee hours 
between night and day. Sometimes we only 
get one customer an hour, sometimes none. 
When they come I hang around them, 
inspecting their movements for a twitch 
toward the cash register and hoping they'll 
strike up a conversation. I dote. I want to 
tell them that I'm lonely and glad to have 
them, bur I don't.

Strange things happen to my mind at 
Walgreens. Lee me explain. 

There is facing. I move an item a few 
inches forward so that it sits at the front of 
its display, right misplaced items, and turn 
items a few degrees this way or that, so that 
they are perfectly square. As always, it is the 
appearance of order that really matters. 

This work takes its toll on me. Absurd as it 
may seem, . the 
experience 
of 
cleaning up the 
store every night 
only to return the 
next evening and 
find it a jungle is 
something alcin to 
running 
on 
a 
treadmill, and I can't help harboring a 
secret animosity towards the customers for 
mussing up the displays. Then there is the 
repetitiveness of this work. I face thousands 
of items a night. There are over wo,ooo 
Walgreens employees in the United States 
of America; Wal-Mart employs "1.3 million 
associates worldwide"; Kmart, Target, Rite 
Aid, the list is endless, and the numbers 
pile up. Is this what human beings were put 
on this earth to do? 

Even though the work is mundane, 
purposeless, and repetitive, I have the 
intractable desire to do a good job and am 
often ashamed by it. 

The music is, to put it lightly, mad-
dening. It is omnipresent, persisting 
through the 2-5 AM hours despite the com-
plete lack of customers. In the break room 
I stand on a chair and turn the ceiling 
speaker off, but every night it's back on 
again. The osmosis of the Muzak's gray 
content into my brain is slowly driving me 
towards insanity. For once, I'm aware that 
some of my colleagues feel the same way, 
having discussed the matter with Joe the 
Security Guard. Husky country voices 
meld into overproduced pop ballads, an 
epidemic of synthesizers into pleading 
R&B tunes, pedestrian harmonicas into 
saxophone solos, painfully catchy odes into 
competitions over the use of the word 
"love." But it all sounds the same through 
these speakers. A friend reminds me that 
this music has probably been tested to 
ensure that it leads to a buying mood. I ask 
Mr. Narichania, and he confirms my suspi-
cion: The music is beamed into every 
Walgreens from a satellite. It comes from 
outer space! 

The day shift and night shift are com-
pletely different. During the day, there is 
action, movement, work to be done. 
During the night there is facing. During 
the day the workers talk to each other, 
laugh, do something to pass the hours and 
soften the job. During the night my col-
leagues are Janet and Mildred. Janet hasn't 
spoken a friendly word to me since I've 
arrived-she hasn't spoken 10 words to me, 
period. I like Mildred, but I worry that 
there's something wrong with her. A typical 
conversation: 

Me: You going to lunch? 
She: Yeah. 
Me [making quote symbols, smiling): 
"Lunch"? 
She: What you mean? 
Me: It's funny to have lunch at 4 AM ..• 
She: Yeah, that's lunchtime. 

The assistant manager before Mr. 
Narichania lasted only two months, and his 
predecessor's tenure was four weeks. So 
they shouldn't be too surprised that I'm 
planning on hanging up my blue vest in a 
few weeks. I feel guilty, of course. I don't 
think they'll mind too much, given that 
they get three or four new applications 
every night. The turnover is surprisingly 
quick in a high-profile gig like this. 

7:24 AM, March 3 
Kay walks in, finally. 
"My savior!" I yell with a grin. 

The customer in front of me, obese 
under her hospital garb, with Buddy Holly 
glasses and diagonally-slicked black hair 
asks, "T his means you can go home?" 
"Yeah. Gee a good night's sleep," I 
laugh. It's groggy, and I'm 7:23 AM. 
"I used co work nights, back when I 
started at the hospital, for three long years. 
The whole world is against you." 
"We should have our own neighbor-
hoods-" 
"Communities!" 
" ... where everyone gets a good day's 
sleep, and the calendar day stares at noon!" 
We pause. 
"It's a dream." 
I hand her some silver and a bag. 
"You have a good day." 

The trick here, as always, is to get 
through the next day, hour, and minute, 
and not to think about the weeks or 
months that may follow. It's just too 
depressing. So I sing at 2 AM, I dribble a 
children's bouncy ball at 3 AM, I dance at 4 
AM, and I almost lose my balance at 5 AM. 
I try to create a parliament of Happy 
Easter! balloons, and I build pyramids with 
a pile of Sony® 6 Hrs (EP) Brilliant Color 
and Sound Premium Grade videotapes. 

Bottom line is, my colleagues work the 
graveyard shift to get away from social 
interaction. 

3:40 AM, March 12 
A woman with brown hair and her left eye 
half-closed walks purposefully into the 
store and directly to the counter. 
"Other than these shirts here, do you 
guys sell, like, clothes?" I think for a second 
as her lame eye flutters. "My kid got all his 
clothes cut up yesterday," she confesses. 
I point her co aisle two, where 
Walgreens stocks a mysterious array of 
ghetto-fatigue XXL shirts and XS shorts in 
bright blues, oranges, and pinks. She runs 
over and returns with a shirt and a pair of 
socks. 
"What happened, if you don't mind 
my asking?" 
"Adam got in a car accident." My 
smile drops, and I ring up her Marlboros 
twice. "He and his ftiends were driving, 
and two quads-four wheelers, not cars!-
ran them off the road. The car flipped over, 
and he's in the hospital." 

11:00 PM, March 15 
As I show up to work one Friday night, my 
Honduran friend Jesus from the afrernoon 
shift is preparing to go, and we talk. 
''I'm leaving soon," I tell him. 
"But your shift just started!" 
"No, I mean this job." 
"Yeah? Me too. There's no life here." I 
know exactly what he means. "Three peo-
ple quit last week." 
"I guess it's going around, like some 
beautiful epidemic. What you doin' next?" 
"Computers. That's my field." I'm 
impressed, and I'm really happy for him. 

Lorna, short with pale features and 
reddish hair, ambles over to us. "I went to 
school to become an RN and a pharmacist. 
All those degrees, and I'm working,"-she 
lowers her eyes and her voice, pauses, then 
looks at me-"here. Nobody wanes to be 
here." 

A tall black woman steps up and inter-
rupts us. "Do you have an application?" 
I'm stoned, and I realize it's obvious as 
my hands reach like pincers for the form, 
which is missing. 
"Sorry, but we're all out."
