The Persistence of Memory 
An elegant young woman stares down at 
the director of the New Haven Colony 
Historical Society as he works in his office, 
a constant reminder that the eyes of histo-
ry are upon him. The director must decide 
what he owes the portrait. Is he a guest in 
her room, or she a guest in his? 

The Historical Society has long been a 
refuge from contemporary New 
Haven. Inside, cows still graze on 
che New Haven Green. Yet even 
the Society has not escaped the 
forces that have changed the city. 
Strolling through the galleries, I 
couldn't help but notice that I 
was alone, and I began to wonder 
if the Society itself was poised to 
fade away like so much of New 
Haven's past. 

For answers 
about 
the 
Society's past and its prospects 
for the future, I turned to former 
Executive 
Director 
Richard 
Hegel and current Executive 
Director Peter Lamothe. Hegel 
was the Society's 
Director in the late 1960s, "the 
Golden Age, back when every-
thing was perfect." Now 74, he is still on 
the Board of Directors, and a quintessential 
old-timer, always genteel. Lamothe, at 31, is 
the bright new hope. He came co New 
Haven to run the society in April of 2000 
with extensive experience in the museum 
field, first at the Thomas Jefferson 
Foundation, which runs Monticello, then 
at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in 
Boston. He speaks like a professional. 
"Historical societies and museums are 
moving away from being a trailitionally 
product-oriented organization and more 
into the service and experience industry." 
In other words, the Society is not just a 
resource for people to come and use; it 
should reach out and offer them new expe-
riences. 

Like most rooms in the Historical Society, 
the director's office has a fireplace. Inside it 
is Benedict Arnold's wrought-iron chim-
neypiece, from 1771. Staunch Arnold fans, 
4 
sifring through the society's archives, might 
also find the sign from his New 
Haven drugstore and his waste book, along 
with a silver tankard owned by Jonathan 
Edwards, a piece of Daniel Webster's 
deathbed, and endless other stuff that 
suaddles the fine line berween historical 
gems and oddball exotica. 

Such relics inspired 
founding. To the founders, 
the Society's 
history was a 
family affair, passed along in heirlooms and 
stories. However, by the 186os, some of 
New Haven's citizens sensed that times 
were changing and this was no longer suffi-
cient. What co do with these memories, 
this scuff? In 1862, they founded the 
Society. The emphasis on family history 
attracted not only antiquarians, but people 
like Mary Ellen Hotchkiss, the elegant 
young woman on Lamothe's wall, who 
fused the Historical Society with high soci-
ety. This association helped to sustain the 
Society for years, but after World War II, 
the old famjjjes began to move to the sub-
urbs, and the Society lost one of its main-
stays of support. "It was always broke," 
remembers Hegel. "Every rime it would 
rain, Ogden [President William Ogden 
Ross] and I would go up to the steel grid 
beneath the roof and push buckets around 
on the I-beams to catch the water so it 
wouldn't leak through the ceiling." 

Fundraising was a personal affair. For 
one exhibition, Hegel and the president 
approached a donor for $xo,ooo. The pres-
ident said, "You're familiar with what we 
can do, and we can do it well." The donor 
responded, "My arrorney will mail you a 
check for SIO,ooo." Once a show goes up, 
believes Hegel, the quality must speak for 
itselÂ£ "If you have a well-presented exhibit, 
it will attract." 

The 18TH century tableware exhibit 
irks Lamothe more than almost any-
thing. Aside from the tableware 
itself, there is nothing attractive 
about it. The room is dim and claus-
trophobic, the tableware crammed 
into small cases, some of them so 
poorly located that a normal-sized 
viewer staniling upright will find 
himself staring not at colonial-era 
china, but at cheap, painted ply-
wood ilisplay walls. Lamothe sees 
this "culture of mediocrity" as 
endemic to the Society he inherited. 
"I'm trying to smash that culture." 
Gesturing with his arm, he tells 
me that the entire display will soon 
be cleared away. "We're going to use 
this space to bouse a new special 
exhibition gallery. Our first show 
will be a photography exhibition on 
redevelopment and the Oak Street neigh-
borhood." The redevelopment exhibit is 
part of Lamothe's effort to move the 
Society away from its focus on 18TH and 
19TH century history. One of his first 
exhibits was on contemporary New Haven 
architects, which attracted 6oo people. The 
society 
also 
collaborated 
with 
International Festival of Arts & Ideas on 
"The 1901 Project," which represented 
turn-of-the~cenrury life through everyday 
items, like the steamer trunk that brought 
a family's possessions across from Europe. 
The crowds were so large that people had 
to be turned away. 

The difference berween Hegel and 
Lamothe isn't exactly that they disagree. It's 
that they agree while saying completely dif-
ferent things. To Lamothe, the Society is 
outdated and in need of reform. In Hegel's 
view, the society remains, and will remain, 
a place that interested people will seek out. 
Lamothe feels there are too many people

who don't yet know they're interested. 
Mary 
Ellen 
Hotchkiss 
watches 
Lamothe every day as he struggles to mod-
ernize the Society. However, she may not 
be watching for much longer. When I 
asked Lamothe about the portrait, he 
shrugged. ''I'm going to clear some of this 
stuff out of here. I want to put up some 
contemporary photography."
