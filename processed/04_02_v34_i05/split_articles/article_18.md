ng habit" would remain a problem throughout their tenure) to 
:eeping outsiders away. To the University, this new cask proved an 
nfinitely more valuable service than the original. There was, 
1ccording to Wiser, no shortage of "vagrant peddlers, and other 
objectionable persons" who posed a threat to the well-being of the 
students in their charge. But, he boasts, "We impressed upon their 
minds the inadvisability of any future visits from them and their 
friends." Ultimately, these services proved valuable enough that the 
University persuaded Donnely and 
Wiser to resign from the New Haven 
Police Department and establish a pri-
vate police force on campus-the earli-
est incarnation of the YPD, with the 
explicit goal of keeping outsiders out.

Far removed from these beginnings, 
the most recent revolution in the depart-

the role of community 
steward in a community 
that is not its own. 
Police Department was undergoing a transformation of its own 
under Chief Nick Pastore, who had taken its helm in 1990 and 
served unril1997. "Our strategy was to better engage the public. We 
faced issues head on with community policing, and Yale came on 
board," recounts Pastore, now a Police Policy Fellow at the Criminal 
Justice Policy Foundation and an outspoken advocate of the tactics 
of community policing. In subsequent years, guided by Pastore and 
then-YPo Chief Al Guyer, acrimony between the departments gave 
way to dose cooperation. "There was this symbiotic relationship 
that became a real friendship," Pastore continued. "We had com-
monality. Our vision was their vision." 

Now, the hour-to-hour functioning of both departments 
depends on constant communication and frequent collaboration.

in Phelps Gate, is linked to the NHPD's, and the forces share

,... resources and information on a daily 
basis. Most ofYale, however, remains 
the ypo's domain, a swathe across 
the center of New Haven with 
other enclaves around the 
City-a total of 910 acres 
that includes Yale build-
athletic fields, a golf 
and the grow-
number of com-
in cruis-
ers, but recent 
years have seen a 
growing emphasis 
on bike cops-
there 
are 
five 
patrolling 
the 
behind the ypo's strategy: Involvement in neighborhoods and com-
munities-maintaining a constant presence in people's day-to-day 
lives-is the best way to reduce overall crime. The reality in which 
the YPO works, however, means that its version of this strategy looks 
considerably different than it would in New York City. Though it is 
primarily responsible for property owned by the University, con-
fronting crime at the source means focusing efforts more and more 
on areas outside the campus itself. Perrotti explains this idea with 
ease: "You have to have some positive involvement in the commu-
nity because there's no wall around Yale. You have to build a bal-
ance." The new Dixwell headquarters is a marquis development in 
this respect. 

Aside from "community," the phrase that Perrotti throws 
around most when discussing the move to Dixwell is "quality of 
life"-the core value of community policing. He explains, "In tra-
ditional policing, you focus on the big stuff. Here, it's a much more 
proactive approach, because we're focusing on quality of life issues." 
Perrotti offers a scenario to consider. There is a string of broken 
down cars on a block. The owners of the cars are not nec-1~~~ 
essarily breaking the law, but the cars give the impres-
] 
sion of neglect, disorder, and danger. That 
impression, according to the holistic systems 
approach of community policing, turns 
neighborhood epidemic of broken down 
cars into a police problem-one which 
demands preemptive action 
and perhaps a bit of courte-
ous but forceful persuasion. 

Perrotti has no shortage of 
alternate examples: "Take 
public 
intoxication. 
Most people don't want 
to walk down the 
street and be both-
ered by someone 
who has had too 
much to drink-
that's a quality of 
life 
1ssue 
too. 

Traffic violations, same thing ... It's a total 
strategy." 

This prospective level of police 
involvement in the Dixwell community 
goes along nicely with other University and 
city plans for the neighborhood. The near-
by Elm Haven public housing complex is 
being demolished in favor of a new mixed-
income development, and Yale has toyed 
with the idea of buying another adjacent 
lot for townhouse development. Pastore, 
for one, calls the move to Lock Street "a 
stroke of genius on the parr of the admin-
istration and the Yale Police Department. 
It's time for Yale to really get down with the 
issues of neighborhood living and make the 
neighborhood tranquil and stable." This 
intention, echoed by Perrotti, Yale's admin-
istration, and New Haven city government, 
is community policing in its purest form. 

With the Yale Police no longer simply a 
security force for University properties, the 
move to Dixwell will mack the culmination 
of a trend-one which will, if all goes 
according to planned, force the YPD into 
the role of community steward in a com-
munity which is not its own. 

A
T A PUBUC MEETING EARLIER this year, 
YPD Lieutenant Michael Patten was 
accused of being part of the "military arm 
of the Yale Corporation." The accusation is 
18 
one the YPD knows well, and 
which-wrapped up with sen-
sitive and sticky issues of race, 
class, and Yale's place in New 
Haven-it has had consider-
able experience trying to 
counter over the last several 
years. 

The most recent high 
proflle incident carne during a 
Yale Law School minority 
recruitment 
weekend 
last 
spring. At two AM on a week-
end night, several Yale police 
cars went in pursuit of two 
young men in" "baggy pants" 
who had attempted to steal an 
air conditioner. On Chapel 
Street, Harold McDougall, a 
black student who attended 
the event, and his host were 
leaving a party when a squad 
car stopped in the street next 
to them. Two officers got our 
and demanded 10 from the 
two.srudents: "I was in a brown jacket, an 
orange sweater, and khaki corduroys-char 
were nor baggy by the way," McDougall 
remembers. "And the cops .said, 'Yeah, 
yeah, that's the description.' What I later 
found out was that the description that 
they gave was 'men in baggy pants,' and 
that was all they needed to stop us and 
question us for 20 minutes." The eyewit-
ness' description did not mention race. 

The problems raised by the incident 
last spring ace not specific to New Haven; 
nor do they allow for easy blame to be cast 
on the police force. "There was consider-
able unrest from people of color who felt 
uniquely challenged,'' says Pastore of the 
period when he was NHPD chief. "Racial 
profiling was a huge issue on campus." 
Jelani Lawson, a 1996 graduate of Yale 
College who served as Ward 2 Alderman 
before leaving New Haven last year, recalls 
an undergraduate and aldermanic career 
marked by periodic harassment by the YPD. 
"Let's say I received less than the average 
deference accorded to members of the 
University community," he says. "In con-
crete terms, it means that I was asked for 10 
while entering college gates. It means that I 
was harassed while standing on a corner 
waiting to get a haircut. It means that I 
always had to have my Yale 10, because if I 
were for some reason stopped by the cops, 
I had to have my 'Get Out of Jail Free' 
card." 

This perception of rampant racial pro-
filing and mistreatment of actual and sus-
pected outsiders persists in the New Haven 
community, despite rhe YPD's fervent denial 
and ongoing efforts to counter it. Recently, 
the University voluntarily agreed to keep 
statistics on traffic stops around campus 
and submit the records to the Chief State's 
Attorney's office, a requirement of public 
police departments from which private 
departments are exempt. Those statistics, 
according to Highsmith, disprove claims of 
favoritism or profiling. Perrotti, when con-
fronted by this type of criticism, points to 
the tremendous diversity of the YPD--17% 
of officers are female, and a quarter ace 
racial minorities, far outstripping the 
national average. "We are a very diverse 
work force, and that is a tremendous bene-
fit, particularly when you're dealing with 
issues on the street," he claims. "We just 
don't have problems with race and gender. 
That reflects our values." 

Bur community activists have long 
dismissed this sort of claim as empty 
rhetoric. Emma Jones is a New Haven res-
ident who has fought for the establishment 
of an aU-citizen police review board since 
her son Malik was gunned down by police 
officers in 1997. As head of the Malik 
Organization, Jones says, "I have had a 
number of complaints, pads of paper where 
people shared that just because they were 
African-Americans or had a certain hair-
style or drove a certain car, Yale police--
and they seem to be worse than the New 
Haven police--gave them bogus rickets, or 
stopped them for no reason, or gave them 
motor-vehicle violations." Jones has met 
with Perrotti and other representatives of 
the YPD in the past, but claims that few of 
their promises have been reflected in 
action. Voicing a widely held belief, she 
charges, "They're shielded from any kind of 
scrutiny because it's Yale." Even Pastore, an 
ardent supporter of the YPD, acknowledges 
the ubiquity of this view. "Much of the 
community feels like they're still not 
engaged, like it's" -here, he slips into the 
tone of either mock reverence or impend-
ing doom that many New Haveners 
employ when referring to the University-
"s.rill Yale." Half-jokingly, Pastore contin-
ues, "If I assigned six undercover agents to 
Yale for six months, I would make more
