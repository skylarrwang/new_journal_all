. whether they're cheering for their favorite 
quarterback or favorite stripper. 
Brett snaps his fingers, regains the 
crowd's attention, and silkily introduces 
"Marky Mark," AKA "Fireman Joe," AKA 
"the New Haven Fire Marshall, here to 
inspect the 'penal' code." 


Marky Mark runs out of the wings like 
a pro-wrestler. His entrance music is a 
crackly nursery rhyme chanted over a 
plinky music box melody. "He's a little fire-
man, he's a little fireman, everyone knows 
he has a great big hose." 


Barely 5'6" in boots, Mark is indeed 
little, but ·makes up for his height with a 
chest and shoulders that threaten to pop 
out of his yellow flame-retardant suit. A red 
fire helmet and coke bottle glasses top the 
outfit. This is Mark's act, his gimmick and 
hook. Ev~ry stripper has one, whether it's as 
a cowboy, a policeman,. or a fireman. 


Mark's hook is unique in that it taps the 
self-deprecating vein of the striptease, He's 
not just up there to strip; the face he puts 
on is one of good times, and he'll be 
damned if he leaves the dance floor with-
our making everyone smile. 


Mark reaches into his pants and pulls 
out a foot and a half length of fire hose. He 
fondles it in time to the song for a moment 
before it fires a jet of colored confetti from 
the nozzle. The women at my table burst 
out laughing. The ice is broken, and the 
show starts in earnest as the house's joyous 
cheers are drowned out by the muscular 
techno standard, "Y'all Ready For This?" 


Mark tears off his jacket, revealing a 
grotesquely built body that strains under a 
white elastic singlet. His bulk is no hin-
drance to his dance moves, however, which 
squirt out of him like hair gel from a bot-
de, setting the evening's standard at an 
impossibly high level. Amidst sidles and 
spins, he pulls off the singlet and heavy 
pants, temporarily keeping the white briefs 
and heavy boots where they are. His solid 
bronze body is unencumbered enough to 
leap through the air and land in a roll that 
pops him back up bopping. 


Mark brings the crowd to the cusp of 
panic before he executes the finishing 
move. He cocks his head and milks the 
moment, as if he can't hear the screams of 
"Take it offi" He grins, rips off the briefs, 
and poses there in all his green G-string 
glory. He swells his chest in happy pride as 
the crowd begins to wave dollar bills like 
green flags at a bull. 


He bounces over to his first lady, a 
wary college brunette whose head is framed 
by her friends' money. Her friends burst 
into cheers when Mark leaps into her lap 
and guides her hands to his rear, exhorting 
her to "Squeeze! Squeeze!" He takes hold of 
her hair and begins to gyrate, grind, and 
pump his hips with convincing sincerity. 


The lap dance lasts for two or three fero-
cious minutes, during which the girlfriends 
scuff the G-string with bills, which give 
Mark's modest package an ironic layer of 
virile padding-so virile, in fact, that he'll 
later have to transfer the wad to his boot to 
make room. 


Mark's performance is clearly meant to 
be rough and sexual, but there's a moment 
at which he becomes oddly sweet. He dis-
mounts, leans over, and gives the brunette 
a soft peck on the cheek, a move the strip-
pers repeat all night long. She looks up at 
him and smiles. This unexpected affection 
lasts for only an instant before Mark breaks 
the spell and twitches his tanned buttocks 
over to the next woman.

A 
THEME BEGINS TO DEVELOP in Brett's 
shtick between performers. He jogs 
out after Mark's maestro routine and asks, 
·~y women getting married tomorrow?" 


A suspicious third of the 100-woman 
crowd cheers, rallying around marital plans 
that may or may not exist. Brett takes the 
30 brides-to-be in perfect stride. The Red 
Hot Pony Express attracts the marrying, 
married, and temporarily unmarried co 
their shows on a regular basis. Brett turns 
to the openly wed women to offer their

counterparts some timely advice. 


"Don't do it!" yell the unrestrained 
wives to the college students. 


"D'gh , B 
"0 
~ t, 
rett says. 
o you want co 
know what SINGLE stands for? Stay 
Intoxicated Nightly, Get Laid Everyday." 


Another witty repartee between Brett 
and the crowd doesn't go as smoothly, but 
speaks to the same concerns. "Hey ladies, 
what's the difference between a tornado 
and a marriage?" 


A witty gal behind me slurs, "They 
both drive you crazy!" Her friends laugh at 
the bon mot. 


"They both drive you crazy ... " Brett 
mulls this over for a moment. "No that's 
not right. The answer is "nothing, 'cause in 
the beginning there's a lor of sucking and 
blowing and in the end you lose your 
house." 


Again and again over the course of the 
evening, Brett's jokes and the interactions 
between women and strippers riff on the 
marriage theme, if only ro make the lap-
dances and stripteases seem that much 
wilder and more forbidden. The sexuality 
gets positively violent at moments, quire 
often at the woman's prodding; the strip-
pers seem warier of the fine line between

sexy forcefulness and aggression. Someone 
behind me screams at a stripper, "Come on 
baby, right here! I got a whole pocketful! 
Get your ass over here!" She has five lap 
dances with him, each one a violent ride 
that leaves her partner with red scratches 
on his ass. 


By the time Brett announces the final 
little roo long. 
stripper, an t8-
year-old sailor, the 
crowd is hurting. 
It's 
unclear 
whether the ladies 
have anything left 
to give after two 
visceral hours of 
screaming, waving 
bills, and getting 
hauled up on the 
shoulders 
of 
ridiculously 
ripped men. The 
applause is weak 
and could be as 
much for the end 
of the show as for 
the stripper. The 
undergrads at my 
table 
have 
expressed an urge 
ro do their own 
dancing. 


T he 
show's gone on a 
Brett brings two beautiful undergrads 
onstage and seats them across from each 
other. A third chair, upon which rests a 
cane and top hat, is between them. The 
well-dressed girls, one blonde, the other a 
brunette, look nervous, bur share a smile 
when Brett growls, "He's your last naked 
man ... he's an officer and a gentleman ... 
his name is Corey!" 


The theme from Top Gun blazes over 
the sound system and Corey, 26 years old 
and a gym owner, strides into the spotlight. 


The over-30 crowd goes wild. They leap 
from their seats and join the collective wail 
of the music's screaming guitars. At 6'6," 
and blonde, blue-eyed, tan, and dressed 
head to roe in officer's whites, he's as close 
ro their dreams as they come. He marches 
past the lucky pair, pivots on his right foot, 
and stops at the edge of the stage, still at 
rigid attention. Corey snaps his right arm 
into a serious and sincere salute, oblivious 
to the cheering and catcalling crowd 
beneath him. 


Corey brings his arm back down and 
the music changes again, this time to Top 
Gun's canonical anthem, "Take My Breath 
Away." Corey stands rigid for a moment 
more, then melodramatically sways, a 
lover's swoon, towards his onstage girl-
friends. He rushes over to the blonde, gath-
ers her in his arms, and lifts her up as if she 
were as light as a feather. Corey looks at her 
sweetly. She puts her arms around his neck. 
And they spin once. Twice. Just like in the 
movtes. 


I freeze. I'm not the only one. All the 
cheering that had seemed so sexual, so deri-
sive, and so visceral, suddenly becomes 
everything I thought a striptease wasn't. 


Yes, a lap dance literally beats you over the 
head with sexuality. Yes, the money's roo 
damn good for these strippers to be in it for 
the love. But something happens in the 
exchange between these paid men and lib-
erated women that deserves to be under-
stood. A woman might come for rhe for-
bidden pleasure of paying a stranger to 
shower them with physical attention, but at 
the end of almost every lap dance, there's a 
gentle kiss that brings it all right back to 
romance, however superficial. It's the per-
fect relationship: three minutes of hot sex 
and sweet nothings with no messy break-
up. 


Not all of the women are touched by 
this sentimental moment. Some are laugh-
ing, and some women left Toad's an hour 
ago. But for the women who find sexuality 
and romance watching a suip show, who 
imagine themselves both in Corey's bed 
and in his arms, this Red Hot Pony Express 
is really something else. No wonder this 
place is packed.
