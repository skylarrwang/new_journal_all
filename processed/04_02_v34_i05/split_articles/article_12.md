"Very very few students . . . who come 
through social programs at Dwight Hall go 
on ro jobs and careers that affect the social 
conditions in the community of New 
Haven or any O[her community, as far as I 
know," George Edwards says as he sits in 
the Dwight Hall common room. 37 years 
ago, Edwards was on campus for the first 
time in this very room, jolting Yalies out of 
their wide-eyed stupor at a Students for a 
Democradc Society meeting. He's been 
around ever since, but chat's made him no 
less pissed off. 

Edwards is proud to be a pain in the 
ass, continually bothering institutions like 
Yale and the city government. His criticism 
of Yale's community-related programs is 
biting. "You look at the last 35 years, and 
there's a serious march to power at Yale to 
take almost total control of the institution-
al power ... in the city of New Haven. I 
don't think it looks good for the future of 
the power of the people in this city." 

He recaJis his first days in New Haven 
with pride. "I think what I had to say then 
was quite shocking to the persons present 
because I was advocating armed struggle as 
a revolutionary thrust, and that was fright-
ening -even my presence while I was talk-
ing." He has agitated, demonstrated, and 
been arrested countless times in the past 
three decades as a Black Panther and advo-
cate for social justice. Edwards and his 
friends used to barge into New Haven pub-
lic schools, demanding inclusion of black 
studies in the curriculum. They called 
themselves the Angry Young Black Men. 

Today, such tactics seem inappropriate 
co some. "People say I'm antiquated, I 
should shut up, retire, don't come to this 
meeting, oh there he goes again, here he 
comes again, oh my God he's got some-
thing ro say, he's gonna say something, he's 
gonna upstage everybody." Edwards does 
not refme those accusations. He does not 
seem ro mind them. "I think that I would 
be absolutely mad ifl didn't activate or give 
something back. I know that I would. I 
probably wouldn't even be sitting here--l'd 
probably be dead." For Edwards, activism 
is not a hobby, but an identity. 

He has not budged from his revolu-
tionary rnindsec; chat is obvious in his every 
word. He is convinced that the World 
6 
Trade Center bombing was an "inside job." 
He carries around anri-war propaganda, 
slapping posters on bulletin boards and 
greeting students he knows with a kind 
word. Speaking to Edwards sends you back 
to 197o-to a much older, tenser New 
Haven. 

For nearly as long as Edwards has been 
an activist, Yale studems have written 
senior essays, seminar papers, and journal-
istic accounts of New Haven-and George 
Edwards--in the late sixties. But Edwards 
can't think of himself as a historical figure. 
He is reticent about his role in the famous 
trial of Bobby Seale, preferring to talk phi-
losophy. I am sicring face to face with a liv-
George Edwards. center 
ing, reluctant historical document. 

Though he is willing co help students 
with their scholarly analysis, he does not 
distinguish what he has lived through from 
what he is living now. Students, decades 
removed from Edwards' Panther years, 
make a distinction between then and now. 
Edwards does not. 

Edwards is still doing what he's always 
done. His message hasn't changed since his 
days as a Panther: Stop exploiting us! His 
cynicism has grown from direct interaction 
with Yale and the New Haven political 
machine, and the short attention span of 
Yale activists infuriates him. "I've seen infil-
trators that get acknowledged as the activist 
srudent heroes, and ten years later, they cut 
the long hair, take off the ragged jeans and 
sneakers. They have two or three degrees 
from the university, and they're in the 
office, suit and rie, giving orders as an 
administrator. Case in point: 
Mike 
Morand. He was the leading anti-apartheid 
student activist. He's almost Secretary of 
the University. You wouldn't know Mike 
Morand now from the Mike Morand of 
'84, '85, '86. It's like a chameleon." 

Yale srudent activists recogniu: and 
even agree with Edwards' concerns, but 
hardly ever implicate themselves as sellouts. 
"I would guess there are some of us who 
don't [sell out]. But without a doubt, many 
of us will go on to work in banking, con-
sulting, industry, fmance, hi-tech, or cor-
porate law," says Justin Ruben, a Forestry 
student active in anri-globalizarion efforts 
who bas spoken with Edwards about his 
own work. 

Despite their differences, Yalies keep 
coming back to Edwards, and Edwards 
keeps corning back to them. Through the 
course of our discussion, Edwards softens 
his rone. "I've had community people, 
white and black, tell me, 'Why are you 
wasting your rime with Yale students?' ... 
but how can you denounce Yale students 
for being involved? People have studies, 
they have their own lives, they're young-
you have to put things in perspective."

Sergeant First Class {Retired) Jose L. 
Romero marches back and forth at the 
head of the room. "Who here can recite the 
cadet creed without srurnbling?" he barks. 
Student after srudent steps up. They all 
begin the same way, speeding through the 
memorized words, but eventually trip up 
and burst into laughter. Romero is disgust-
ed. "I tell you what, I'm going ro pick on 
one boy, and if he can't recite the creed, all 
the boys are going ro drop and give me 
fifty." When his chosen victim fails to recite 
it perfectly, he reminds them of what they 
discussed the day before: "You know what 
they say? They say black schools and inner 
city schools are the most difficult .... On 
Monday I talked to you about respect and 
discipline. Do I need to make you sir with 
your palms on the table again? The first 
thing [that goes wrong], guess what, I'm 
going to lynch you right our there: he 
says, pointing past the American Aag by the 
window, "and then I'm going to burn a taco 
so they know it was me." He calls our to a 
girl who has already failed her first anempr 
to recite the creed. "Williams, you said you 
were going ro come up here." "I can't, sir. 
. My hearr is beating!" "You're weak!" He 
screams, 
pointing at 
her 
violently.
