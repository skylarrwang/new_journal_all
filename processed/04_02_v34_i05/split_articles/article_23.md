T HE LADIES ENTER. ADJUST THEIR EYES to the dim lighting, and 
take their places in the horseshoe of chairs and tables around 
the dance floor. The college girls in the crowd, Saturday night war-
riors in bright tops, black panes, and slathered glitter, sit down 
quickly, and nervously order Mike's Hard Lemonade. The 30-and-
older set is more boisterous, with permed hair and half-buttoned 
denim blouses. They saunter in and belly up to the bar for an open-
ing round of cheap beer. By the time they take their sears, they've 
strapped a couple of beers on and are ready for the show to begin. 
It's Saturday night at Toad's Place, and the Red Hot Pony Express is 
about to leave the station. 

Toad's is infamous for its late night dance parties, semi-exclu-
sive affairs where men and women with proper 10 can grind their 
blues away to remixed hip-hop and strobed lighting. Once or twice 
a semester, things change. Courtesy of the Red Hot Pony Express, 
Toad's sheds irs dance hall skin and devolves into a raucous mess of 
a strip dub, where enthusiastic men in G-strings and boors will rub 
up against a woman's leg only if she's offered him a crisp dollar bill 
first. On nights when the Red Hot Pony Express is in town, no mat-
ter what their age, no matter whether they're leaving behind a high-
paying job, a sink full of rushes, or a sociology paper, these women 
squeeze sexual liberation until it bursts. 

w ITH THE EXCEPTION OF ToAD'S BOUNCERS and bartenders, 
tonight I'm the only man in a sea of more than a hundred 
women. In this sexually charged atmosphere, I'm a non-entity. I'm 
not getting onstage to shake my booty; I'm watching just like the 
rest of them. I sit at a table next to the stage with seven women who 
spend most of their time talking like I'm not there. Our quarters are 
tight, which keeps the experience vivid and dose, especially when I 
have to scoot over to allow my neighbor ample room for a lap dance 
later in the show. 

To my left, th,ree Yale students are psyching themselves up for 
their first male strip show. They're dressed for a night out, but are a 
little too put together for the lewd atmosphere. They're here for the 
full experience, but shy away from <liscussing the nearly naked men. 
For "health reasons," they're going to forgo the lap dances tonight. 
They will spend much of the show with their hands over their 
mouths, giggling and asking each other, "Did you see that?" One of 
their number is securely righteous when she tells me that she thinks 
it's the lewdest thing ever. (After the show, she changes her tune and 
says she'd certainly go again.) For now, though, the suitemates ner-
vously joke about the townified nature of the crowd. The New 
Yorker of the bunch leans over to me and advises, "Make sure you 
write down how scary the women are." 

"Which women?" I ask. 
"All of them." 
She could very well be tallcirig about 
the rest of the table, if by scary she means 
intent on seeing a man in a G-string. To my 
right are a pair of gravelly-voiced, tightly-
coiffed 40-year olds who work for Yale on 
weekdays. Although they've had strippers 
for birthdays, they've never been to a strip 
show and are enthusiastic. Their cameras 
will guarantee lap dances later in the 
evening. 

They've come with one of the final 
women at the table, a petite Yale undergrad 
they work with during the week. She sits 
across from me with her friend, another 
student who's been to a strip show before. 
They are visibly excited, loud, ready to 
embrace the endless parade of flesh. They 
will match the strippers' enthusiasm, 
scream for scre.am, grind for grind. When 
one of the girls gets her "birthday" lap 
dance, the stripper will cradle her face in 
his hands and gleefully yell, "C'mere, 
baby!" For her part, she will grab his ass as 
tight as anyone else does that evening. 

Everyone at the table, mys!!lf included, 
has a different reason for being here 
tonight. Its "the experience," "my friend's 
birthday," "a writing assignment," "to sup-
port a friend." These reasons, though indi-
vidually defensible, ignore the fact that it's 
8:45, the show was supposed to begin 15 

T HE EMCEE JOGS OUT TO the middle of 
the dance floor, drawing a few cheers 
of relief from the audience. He's dressed 
casually but smartly, in crisp blue jeans, a 
right silver shirt, and a black leather blazer. 
He's a smooth character and good at relax-
ing the nervous first-rimers into the enthu-
siastic sexual aggression shared by the rest 
of the audience. He hawks Niagara, 
Viagra's carbonated fruit cousin, smoothly 
assuring, "When these guys get you hot 
and horny, do whatever you want, cause 
you're the ones in control tonight." 

"How many girls here are just plain 
horny?" he asks. 

"Take it offi" screams someone in the 
audience. This is the battle cry of the 
evening, raised by the crowd when some-
one on the dance floor is doing too much 
teasing and not enough stripping. T he 
emcee's doing well, and the momentum is 
building. 

He laughs and says, "Okay, my name's 
Brett. Now you have to scream out your 
name on the count of three. One, two, 
three!" 

The women respond most heartily 
where I'm sitting, dubbed the "Sexy 
Erection Section" by Brett. Apparently I'm 
surrounded by "season ticket holders," 
ladies who have been to shows before and 
have mastered the proper "fold and stuff" 
technique for the placement of dollar bills. 
The first timers don't get off so easily. 
"Tonight you are all fucking virgins," Brett 
sarcastically intones. The season dcket 
holders cheer. "Tonight, ladies, this is your 
one true opportunity to be a virgin." 

The 40-year-old "virgin" to my right 
leans over and mutters to me, "Oh God, I 
gotta go home." 

"Okay, ladies, are you ready to see 
your first naked man?" 

Even the "virgins" join in as the crowd 
yells a forceful affirmative. The momentum 
of female sexuality breaks for a moment 
when three women behind 
me start yelling guttural 
"Yeah!"'s at Brett. Brett does 
a double take. The testos-
teronic irony is clear: 
T hey're playing the 
alpha male at the 
Kitty Kat Club, 
loud, abrasive, and 
confused 
as
