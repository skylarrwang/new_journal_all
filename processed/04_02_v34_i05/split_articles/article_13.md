"Everybody drop and give me ten!" The 
entire class drops to the floor and begins to 
do the push-ups. When they are done, he 
calls six students to the front. They recite 
the creed in unison: 
I am an army ]ROTC cadet. I will 
always conduce myself to bring 
credit co my family, country, 
school and corps of cadets. I am 
loyal and patriotic. I am the 
future of the United States of 
America. I do not lie, cheat,Â· or 
steal and will always be account-
able for my actions and deeds. I 
will always practice good citizen-
ship and patriotism. I will work 
hard to improve my mind and 
strengthen my body. I will seek 
the mantle of leadership and 
stand prepared co uphold che 
constitution and the American 
way of life. May God grant me 
the strength to live by this creed. 
The whole process cakes half a class period. 


Suddenly, the bell rings, and the students 
erupt out of their seats and dash to the 
door. 
This is the }ROTc's second year in 
operation at Hillhouse High School, a 
sprawling, newly renovated building on 
Sherman Parkway with mostly black and 
Hispanic students. For four years, Principal 
Lonnie Garris, a former ROTC cadet him-
self, lobbied to bring the program to 
Hillhouse in spite of bureaucratic red tape 
and community opposition. As Dana 
Charles, a senior ]ROTC cadet, explains, 
"Parents and a Joe of people were against it, 
because they thought it promoted violence. 
They signed petitions. They thought we 
would be using guns." 


}ROTC is not the military's only means 
of gaining access co Hillhouse students. 
Recruiters regularly come into the school 
cafeteria ac lunch and stop students in the 
hallways. According to cadet Shana Barton, 
recruiters will say anything to get a student 
to enlist. "My recruiter wasn't telling me 
[important information] cause he wanted 
me to join right then .... They get paid 
more money if they recruit more." While 
students are suspicious of recruiters, they 
see retired Colonel Donald B. Leazott, the 
}ROTC director, as an ally. The military is 
anxious co distinguish }ROTC from its direct 
recruitment programs. On the school's 
website, the JROTC at Hillhouse says its 
mission is "To motivate young people to be 
better citizens." Above all, Colonel Leazott 
wanes to emphasize that his program is not 
a recruitment tool. "We don't work with 
recruiters," he insists. "We are not a recruit-
ing program." 


Yet Shanavia Swepson, a freshmi'-n 
cadet, says that after joining JROTC "mostly 
everybody I know, most of the boys and 
some of the girls" are planning to join the 
military. Whatever the party line about the 
military's intent, it seems the effect of 
JROTC is to encourage enlistment. And 
Marilyn DeJesus, a second year cadet, 
recalls Army Sergeant Dorsey coming into 
the classroom several times. Her experience 
is typical. "[Before joining JROTC] when I 
thought about the army, I thought about 
wars. But it's not really like that. I had a 
whole different perspective. Sergeant 
Dorsey cleared that up for me." Now she 
says she is going into Basic Training this 
summer. Many of the other students with 
whom I spoke experienced similar conver-
sions after joining }ROTC. "Before, I was not 
serious about joining the military," said 
Charles, who was just accepted into West 
Point. "Then Sergeant Romero taught us 
about West Point in class ... [and the 
Colonel] drove me up to visit." 


Some parents and others worry that 
students are making uninformed decisions 
with 
serious 
repercussions. 
Joanne 
Sheehan, the New England coordinator of 
the War Resistors League, regularly goes 
into schools to give kids the information 
the military leaves out. To a girl like 
Barton, whose recruiter promised a job in 
"engineering," Sheehan would explain, 
"The actual assignment you get is com-
pletely at the discretion of the military." 
And beware, Sheehan warns, the promises 
of increased earning power. "Most job 
training in the military is not transferable 
to the real world," she explains. "One of 
the most potent recruiting tools is the 
notion that if you enlist it will pay for your 
education." 


Unfortunately, she says, 
"Statistics show that few people are able to 
take advantage of [this money]." And with 
increased 
reserve 
deplovment 
after 
September 11, enlistment itself may be a 
question of life and death. 


After the JROTC class ends, I ask 
DeJesus what she would do if she changed 
her mind about going to war after enlist-
ing. She looks puzzled. ''I'd probably get 
myself kicked out, or ask for permission to 
leave." Did she know what might happen 
to her? "I think you get disciplined or 
something." In fact, she could be jailed or 
dishonorably discharged. Had the Colonel 
or the Sergeant ever talked about stuff like 
that? Marilyn laughs. "They wouldn't want 
us to get a bad opinion about the army. 
They wouldn't want to talk about the real 
things." I ask her if she knows how long she 
will be committed to the army if she 
enlists. "I'm not really sur~I think it's 
two years minimum." The minimum com-
mitment is eight years, two of active duty 
and six in the reserves, during which time 
you can always be called into active duty. I 
asked her if she has ever done any research 
beyond asking her recruiter and Colonel 
Leazott about how enlistment works or 
about her rights once there. She shakes her 
head. "I pretty much know the things I 
need to know."
