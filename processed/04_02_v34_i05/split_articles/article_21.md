'I 
Y FRIEND COMMITTED suicide 
ll a year ago, although no one 
~ew it was suicide at the time. 
Julie died on April 3o--found on 
the floor of her Massachussetts 
Institute ofTechnology dormroom 
by her roommate-and nobody 
quite knew why. I went to Boston 
for a student-organized service and 
listened to people say great things 
about her character and life. I 
spoke to a man who had met her 
at a debate a week before her 
death; he could not comprehend 
the fact that someone so alive 
had just died. I headed home, 
still unable to accept that 
Julie was gone. I was scared 
to sleep alone, afraid that 
one night my heart would 
stop like hers did, without 
warning. 

On June 26, everyone's 
perspective changed. The 
coroners ruled her death a suicide by 
cyanide poisoning. The press did not seem 
surprised; Julie Carpenter was, after all, a 
chemical engineering major at MIT-which 
meant that she had access to aU sorts of poi-
sons-and her housemate had lit herself on 
fire and died from the burns just a year 
before. But I held fast to the idea that she 
had mixed up pills, intenrung to take No-
Ooz instead and discovering her mistake 
too late. I tried to resign myself to a sort of 
Zen acceptance of the fact that we'd never 
really know what happened. That worked 
until August. 

On August 9, the Boston Globe ran a 
front page story detailing an entirely differ-
ent scenario. "In the months before her sui-
cide in April," reporter Patrick Healy 
wrote, 
"Massachusetts 
Institute 
of 
Technology sophomore Julie M. Carpenter 
was stalked and harassed by a love-struck 
freshman and then endured an excruciating 
campus inquiry that initially failed to stop 
him." I had visited Julie the previous 
November. At the time, the student had 
been quietly and intensely attracted to her. 
Even though she made it clear to him that 
she was not interested, he still followed her 
through the halls, slept outside her door, 
and accessed emails she had written to her 
boyfriend. Distressed by the relentless 
attention, she finally complained to her 
student house committee in January. The 
committee stalled for a month while the 
harassment continued. 

Finally, the case 
was handed over to the Office of the Dean 
for Student Life, and the harasser was 
moved to another dorm. But it was two 
more months before the administration 
officially ruled that Julie had actually been 
harassed, and her assailant's punishment 
was minimal: He was required to arrend 
three therapy sessions, read three books 
about trauma, and write an essay on harass-
ment. Despite everything, he would be 
allowed to reapply to live in Julie's house 
the following year. 

Five days later, Julie 
killed herself. 

The connections between the sexual 
harassment case and Julie's death are 
srrong. Her boyfriend's father stated in a 
letter to MIT that "everyone who knew Julie
