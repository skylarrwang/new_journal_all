I walk into the new Walgreens, a shade of gray just lighter than 
death. Saccharine radio pop-rock-hip-hop blares from unseen 
speakers. This week's specials scream from all sides. 
'Could I have an application please?' I ask the cashier. He pulls 
one out from under the desk and smiles slightly. He knows some-
thing. I ask him about this shift. It's 4 PM co 12 AM paving the way 
for the graveyard shift, 12 AM to 8 AM. 
I figure that's where I want to be. Halfway berween New 
Haven gheuoes and Yale-New Haven Hospital, there's gona be 
interesting stuff going on at 4 AM under these fluorescent lighrs. 
But will I get shot? 
"Well, yeah, if the bullet's got your name on ir. .. "

Having returned the application and gotten the call I was waiting 
for, I show up for the "computer test." The questions on the test are 
strictly co ensure that I am right for Walgreens and Walgreens is 
right for me; it will be helpful only ifl am completely truthful. 
The first few questions have to do with how many crimes I've 
committed and how recendy. Then I move on to the drug section. 
"Walgreens understands that it is typical in American society co 
experiment with drugs. However, Walgreens is not inrerested in hir-
ing any addictS." 
The next screen is blum: "What kind of items have you stolen 
from your employer(s) in the past 24 months?" The choices include: 
{a) Food, candy, chips, etc. 
{c) COs, hair dryers, records, etc. 
(f) Cars, jewelry, etc. 
. 
To supplement: "What would you say is the total cash value of 
the items you've stolen from your employer(s) in the past 24 
months?" the options range <$J to >$100,000. 
Actual Walgreens employees come onto the computer screen. 
They tell me what they like best and worst. They like the ~Â­
raderie best. A chipper young woman intones that the most diffi-
cult thing to get used to is angry customers; she looks pretty angry 
herself. 

APRIL 2002 

Finally, the crucial 
test. A video of a cus-
tomer is to be shown, 
and I am to respond as 
I would m reality. A 
reddish, 
drooping 
woman in her 40s 
materializes. "Yesterday 
they told 
me 
chat 
they'd have my photos 
today. Now you tell me 
they're not here. I'll kill 
you if you tell me co 
come back tomorrow!" 
The 
following 
week l have an inter-
view. Afrer five mmutes 
of questions, my future 
boss sighs, "Well, I see no reason not to hire you. So, pending your 
passing a drug test, you're hired." She's clearly elated to be working 
with me, and we shake hands. 

9:00 AM, February 4 
A trainee watches three videos before beginning employment at the 
Walgreens on York Street, where Parking Is Limited To 60 Minutes 
Or Your Car is Towed. One of them is called "So You're Starting a 
New Job." 
It's the best by far. 
The 'host' is a man named John Astin. You may remember him 
from such films as G~t to Know ~ur Rabbit, /GUn Tomatoo Eat 
Franu! and Supmonsur, and as a leader of a Buddhist sect in Santa 
Monica, or a visiting professor at Johns Hopkins University. But 
we've all <>een him before in the nightmares of our collective sub-
conscious. He has smiling jowls that seem to curl and crinkle, and 
a strange rwink.Je in his eyes, like Vince Fontaine in Gm:u, or a hol>t 
on a variety show gone sour.
