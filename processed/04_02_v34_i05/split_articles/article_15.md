**Funny Girls**

Women aren't funny. That's the impression 
you get from watching them in comedy 
shows at Yale. But as a seven-year veteran of 
an all-female education, I knew women 
could be talented comedians. I hoped that 
I would find the same in college. But here, 
humor seems to be a man's domain in the 
performance world. When Marisa Bass told 
me she was starting an all-female comedy 
group, I was thrilled. The first show's 
sketches were diverse, spoofing everything 
from a cappella singing to Jesus Christ. It 
wasn't the funniest show I'd ever seen, but 
it was a good start. Bass' ensemble--the 
Sphincter Troupe--is a first step in liberat-
ing the Funny Woman at Yale. 


As it turns out, the group wasn't trying 
to liberate anyone. Rather, when they 
decided to start an all-female group, they 
were only trying to do something fresh. 
"The Fifth Humor was here first, so anyone 
else has to do something different to have a 
reason to be here," says Bass. Founding the 
Troupe was in part a reaction to the Fifth 
Humor. "[Co-founder] Jessica [Cohen] 
and I would go to Fifth Humour shows 
and see that the guys wrote all the sketches 
and the women didn't have any good 
parts," Bass says. "It didn't seem to me like 
it was because the girls weren't funny, but 
because the parts that were written for 
them didn't allow them to be funny." 


Unlike any other comedy group at Yale, in 
the Sphincter Troupe women write, direct, 
and perform their own work. And in an all-
female rehearsal environment, they can 
relax, be creative, and have fun. "What 
really works about our group is that every-
one listens to each other," Bass says. "We 
like each other, we spend time together, we 
don't have internal fights in the group, and 
I think it comes across in our shows that 
we're having fun, which makes the shows 
funnier." 


But taking men out of the equation 
may only perpetuate the problem by sug-
gesting that women can't match men joke 
for joke when they share the stage. The fact 
remains that in co-ed performances, 
women aren't quite pulling their weight. 
Take the Fifth Humor as an example. As a 
general rule, Humor women don't write 
sketches and have not yet directed or pro-
duced any of the group's shows. The 
women play the parts of wives or daughters 
or talk show hosts-mere supporting roles. 
Adam Wells, president of the Fifth Humor, 
says this is because "the sketches are written 
by males for males. Sketch ideas are hard to 
come up with, and when you think of an 
idea you want to write it. You don't want to 
put it off just to write a sketch with girls in 
it." According to him, the process is not a 
conscious attempt to exclude women from 
comedy. Rather, it's a response to the fact 
that most comedic archetypes are male. 
"When you're looking to make fun of a his-
torical figure or a certain profession, you're 
going to think of a guy, because it is so 
much more common for those figures to be 
men." Wells argues further that letting 
women play these roles complicates what 
could otherwise be straightforwardly 
funny. "A big part of the success of a sketch 
is figuring out what your joke is and stick-
ing to it. Adding other layers can some-
times distract from what you're really after." 
Humor is the first priority, even if success 
requires alienating half the members of a 
group. 


This male-dominated stage dynamic is 
also apparent when improvisational come-
dy groups perform. The women often seem 
inhibited. And nothing is less funny than 
someone trying to be funny when she obvi-
ously thinks she's not. Often, the funniest 
topics seem taboo for women to joke 
about. "Girls can rarely pull off dirty 
humor," says Molly Worthen, a junior who 
is a former member of the Viola Question. 
"We were playing one of the line games," 
she says, describing an experience she had 
as the only actress performing in vQ's 
twelve-hour improv marathon. "One of the 
guys was like, 'right, our topic is ... VAGINAS!' I was so alienated. As a girl, I just can't 
make those jokes." 


What's clear to Worthen, Bass, and 
other aspiring comediennes is that women 
can't just wait around until it's okay for 
them to be crass on stage. Women can be 
funny, but perhaps not in the same crude 
ways as men. They need to discover the 
comedic vocabulary that's natural to them. 
The Sphincter Troupe is an important first 
step in allowing women to do just that, and 
Yale audiences may soon be more comfort-
able with funny women. But before that 
happens, they must learn to crack a new 
kind of joke.
