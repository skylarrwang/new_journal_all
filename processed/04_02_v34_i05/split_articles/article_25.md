IF YOU PEER BEHIND THE IRON DOORS OF ONE OF YALE's secret 
societies on any given Thursday or Sunday night, you won't 
find 15 white men chortling at the world over cigars and brandy. In 
face, you will see a picture right out of a college admissions view-
book: Sirting around the dinner table will be a black man, a Latina, 
a South Asian woman, several Jews, and a few roken WASPs. They 
will be journalists, athletes, intellectuals, and activists; some will be 
gay, some will be Christian, and there will be at least one represen-
tative of Yale's rarest minority, the conservative. They are the new 
faces of the Yale elite, but in its old home. Within their halls they 
enjoy all the ancient trappings of mystery and luxury; they are 
served dinner by a staff and study in a private library. And among 
the privileges that they do not share with you is an educational and 
a social experience that Yale's best have tasted in one form or anoth-
er for over 150 years. 


I 
HAVE ALWAYS HAD A PRYING INTEREST IN SKUll and Bones and 
its younger siblings. After last year's tap night left me unaffili-
ated, my curiosity intensified and soured. But my interest in the 
societies as educa.cional institutions really sprung our of the uncer-
tain days after September 11. I was involved in a number of efforts 
to bring together students of different cultural backgrounds and 
political convictions tO talk about the attacks, and I found again 
and again that the gulfs between students' perspectives were too 
wide to bridge constructively in a public forum. The debate could 
not be civil. I realized thac the obstacles preventing dialogue were 
more personal than political, but ironically they belonged more to 
a public than a private conversation. The secret societies were, I 
began to suspect, a possible solution.

Secret societies are social experiments. Fifteen juniors from dif-
ferent backgrounds, who have distinguished themselves in different 
walks of Yale life, are thrown together in an environment structured 
to bring about meaningful interaction and self-reflection. After 
three years of building friendships and making names for them-
selves, about ten percent of every Yale class is chosen at the end of 
its junior spring to be a part of one or another of these groups. 
There are six societies with tombs, and a more fluid roster that meet 
in other spaces, following the original model with varying levels of 
seriousness. The shroud of each society's rituals, and the pro~ 
for its initiates that those rituals concal, differ from ball to hall and 
from rented bouse to borrowed room. But three things are almost 
universally shared: an emphasis on honest debate, candid autobiog-
raphy, and seaecy. 


Members liken the intensity of the social climate inside their 
halls to rhat of the lace-night discussions they had with friends and 
roommates when they first came to Yale. This may be chalked up to 
the excitement of a new environment and new friends, but the 
depth and the candor of society conversations seem to be staked 
upon the other trappings of the experience. "More than secret, 
maybe [societies] are just private, .. one member cold me. Without 
years to develop crusting friendships, members of a society are 
thrown into intimate contact. The secrecy creates a safe environ-
ment, and the oral autobiographies given by each member in most 
societies deepen the bonds betweeo stUdents quickly. Not all mem-
bers are equally enthusiastic about the biographies, though: They 
last as many as five hoW'S -and can be Yehides for .narcissism or exhi-
bitionism as easily as they can promote understanding.
