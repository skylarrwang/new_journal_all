narcotics arrests than I make in Dixwell in 
a year. When you put that in terms of inci-
dence of crime, it would be far higher on 
campus than in any neighborhood." He 
adds, of course, "That's not to say that I 
ever would." But the point resonates in a 
neighborhood like Dixwell, and this reso-nance wiU be something to contend with as 
the perceived agent of privilege, wealth, 
and whiteness moves its forces into a poor 
and almost exclusively black community.

THE 
DISCUSSION of 
"cooperation," "understanding," and 
"engagement," community policing is 
about one thing: the perception of safety. 
Taking that perception seriously, in fact, 
has been the greatest success of the strategy, 
and one that Perrotti and the YPO whole-
heartedly adopt. "Even if people are safe, if 
they don't feel safe, then it's a problem," 
Perrotti acknowledges, "Sometimes percep-
tion is reality." 

In that respect, the success of the YPD 
in Dixwell will have as much to do with 
factors outside of its control as with its own 
behavior. Above all, however, it will require 
that the YPO and the University as a whole 
take seriously the sense of injustice and 
rnisueacmenc rather than sticking by num-
bers and complaint records alone. In the 
past, Perrotti has been known to refuse 
interviews about racial profiling accusa-
tions, and the University's often vapid offi-
cial rhetoric remains unconvincing to large 
portions of New Haven. But in communi-
ty policing, as Pastore says, "If it's a percep-
tion, it m ust be dealt with." 

Over the course of the last decade, the 
University's heightened interest in the city 
has stemmed from the belief that what is 
good for New Haven is good for Yale. As 
the empty lot in Dixwell transforms into 
the headquarters of the YPO, the neighbor-
hood must begin to believe that the reverse 
is also true. As Pastore cautions, "When 
Yale opens up its doors on Lock Street, it 
has to remember that it's a visitor and it 
should act like a visitor who wants to be 
welcomed."
