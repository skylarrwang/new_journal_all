Novelist John Crowley rewrites history from the inside 
Th~ Translator by John Crowley (William Morrow, 2002.), pp. 285. 

F OR A FEW HOURS LAST FALL, we glimpsed history. Some of us 
watched from our sofas, others from rooftops in Brooklyn, and 
still others from the very jets that slammed into the World Trade 
Center. As the Twin Towers collapsed in a cloud of ash and smoke, 
the world changed irrevocably-yet in our sight. John Crowley, a 
professor of English at Â·Yale, tries to capture something like this in 
his new novel Th~ Translator. What, he asks, is it like to experience 
and to be a part of history? Modest, yet scrupulously crafted, Th~ 
Translator offers rare insight into the inner workings of the past. 

Critics tend to categorize Crowley's fiction as magical realism 
or fantasy, but Th~ Translator hardly fits that mold. The novel is a 
work of historical fiction. The angels, talking a:nimals, time travel-
ers, magical houses, and elaborate, otherworldly milieus that per-
vade Crowley's previous seven novels and numerous novellas are 
glaringly absent, supplanted by normal people and historical figures 
in familiar, earthly surroundings. Set mostly in the si:nies at an 
unnamed midwestern university, the world of The Translator looks 
something like a baby-boomer's college yearbook: Characters sing 
Pete Seeger songs, get drunk, read the poetry of A. E. Housman, and 
go to student protests. 

The story begins in early 1962, the year of the Cuban missile 
crisis, when the novel's heroine Christa "Kit" Malone starts her 
freshman year of college a semester late. Like most gifted poets, Kit 
has gone through some rough times in her childhood. During her 
senior year of high school, she gave birth to a fatally deformed baby; 
later, she attempted suicide. None of this seems to matter, though, 
when she finagles her way into a class taught by an exiled Russian 
poet named lnnokenti Falin, a Joseph Brodsky type, and quickly 
falls in love with him. Falin at first appears gruff-he startles his 
students on the first day of class with the warning that they will be 
graded solely on the memorization of poems ("Best to memorize 
all," he says. "Observe this motto of Soviet Young Pioneers: Be 
Prepared')-but Kit finds his icy fa~de enchanting. When she 
bumps into him one night at the library and subsequently has cof-
fee with him at an aU-night diner, an improbable friendship devel-
ops between them. As the summer approaches, with the Cuban 
missile crisis looming in the background, Falin and Kit grow clos-
er-so close that he asks her ro help him translate his corpus into 
English.

This storyline may sound sappy-and to some degree it is-
but Crowley has a knack for crafting beautiful sentences that 
redeem even the most mawkish narrative. As Kit hugs Falin before 
returning home for a few weeks, for instance, he writes, 

She knew-she knew by now-that there really can be a 
person, one at least, that you can embrace as easily and 
wholly as though the two of you were one thing, a thing 
that once upon a time was broken into pieces and is now 
put back together. And how could she know this unless he 
knew it too? It was part of the wholeness, that he must:
