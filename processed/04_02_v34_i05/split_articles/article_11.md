On March 19, Graham Boyd, a 
New Haven-based lawyer for the 
American Civil Liberties Union, 
went to court. Not just any court. 
He represented Lindsay Earls 
before the Supreme Court of the 
United States. When Earls, now a 
freshman at Dartmouth, was a 
sophomore at Tecumseh High 
School in Oklahoma, she was 
required as a member of the after-
school choir to give a urine sample 
to check for marijuana, heroin, 
cocaine, and steroids. Earls filed 
suit against the school board that 
had ordered the test, claiming it was an 
infringement of her constitutional rights. 
The ACLU took her case, and it slowly per-
colated through the judicial system, ending 
up in the Supreme Court. 

At five o'clock that morning, I stood 
shivering under a dark morning sky; I 
could just make out the words "Equal 
Justice Under The Law" glaring down at 
me. The argument was scheduled to begin 
at 10 AM, but public tickets were given out 
on a first come, first served basis. I had five 
hours to wait. 

Boyd, who graduated from Yale 
College in 1987 and Yale Law School in 
1992, oversees the ACLU's Drug Policy 
Litigation Project out of its New Haven 
office. This case, Board of Education v. 
Earls, Number 01-332, seemed simple. 
Boyd would argue that testing students just 
because they are involved in extracurricular 
activities is a violation of a provision of the 
Fourth Amendment-the right to be free 
from unreasonable search and seizure. 

What made the case more complicated, 
however, was that Tecumseh High School's 
policy seemed only a modest expansion of 
a drug testing policy approved in a 1995 
case. Then, the Supreme Court had ruled 
APRIL 2002 
that high school athletes in Vernonia, 
Oregon, could be required to submit to 
mandatory drug tests. But in Vernonia 
there was evidence of widespread drug use 
among athletes. At Tecumseh, there was no 
such evidence: Only five of 500 students 
tested in recent years have shown up posi-
tive for drug use. In fact, students involved 
in an extracurricular activity like choir 
seemed even less likely than the general 
population to be using drugs--a key point 
in Boyd's argument. 

A few minutes after ten, a dull buzzing 
noise filled the court's main chamber, and a 
hush senled over the observers and liti-
gants. The Crier swung his gavel down on 
a wooden block. We all stood as he 
announced, "The honorable, the Chief 
Justice and the Associate Justices of the 
Supreme Court of the United States. Oyez, 
oyez, oyez." From behind the fl~wing cur-
tains, the justices emerged in unison, clad 
in long black gowns. The simultaneous low 
buzz, whoosh of the curtain, and sudden 
appearance of nine of the most influential 
people in the world was overwhelming. I 
felt like I was watching a play, everything 
scripted and performed a thousand times 
before. 

As soon as Linda Meoli, the lawyer 
representing the Independent School 
District No. 92 of Pottawatomie County, 
Oklahoma, began her argument, I realized 
this performance would not go as planned. 
Before Meoli could get out a sentence, 
Justice O'Connor broke in with an unrelat-
ed question. Then Justice Souter noted that 
the Tecumseh school district has shown a 
very low incidence of drug use, to which 
Justice Rehnquist caustically replied on 
Meoli's behalf, "The existence of th~ policy 
might be expected to deter drug use, 
wouldn't it?" Justice Ginsberg, in a slow 
and roundabout response, drew a crucial 
distinction between the last drug testing 
case and this one. Through it all, the argu-
ment was easy to follow; the questions were 
supremely logical and free oflegalese, based 
on straightforward common sense. 

Boyd took the podium after 
an intense half-hour of argument 
dominated by questions from 
Meoli's opponents on the bench. 
The justices that laid low during 
Meoli's argument sprang to life 
when Boyd approached the podi-
um. Scalia brought his chair to its 
upright position, Kennedy stared 
intensely, and Rehnquist's eyes 
flashed red. (Only Justice Thomas, 
his undivided attention apparently 
devoted to the ceiling, remained 
aloof during both arguments.) At 
points during Boyd's argument, 
intensity grew to anger. Kennedy, 
presenting to Boyd a hypothetical 
scenario, referred to a school that 
did not test for drugs as "the druggie 
school." "No parent," he continued, 
"would send a child to that school-except 
maybe your client." This personal attack 
seemed strangely out of line, especially 
since Earls had tested negative for drug use. 

Both sides finished, and I descended 
from the highest court in the land in a 
daze. Both lawyers had endured a mental 
firing squad of the sharpest shooters in the 
country; just watching took it out of me. 
From the sea of supporters for both sides, I 
watched Lindsay Earls, my age exactly, 
walk down the front steps of the Supreme 
Court, the words "Equal Justice Under the 
Law" looming above her. Something 
clicked. Equal justice means accessible jus-
tice. Lindsey Earls, a regular teenager from 
a small town in Oklahoma had a problem 
with the way her school conducted busi-
ness, and it turned our to be important 
enough for the most influential judicial fig-
ures in the world to puzzle through. 

The Court will release its ruling on her 
case this SUfll..\Der.
