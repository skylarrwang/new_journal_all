and that too she knew. With her 
he was for a moment whole, they 
were whole: as whole as an egg, 
and as fragile. 

Though abstract, this is deeply affecting 
prose. 

Though the story centers on the tens-
est moment of the twentieth century, The 
Translator never turns into the sprawling 
war-epic, in the tradition of Tolstoy's ~r 
and Peace or Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, 
that one might hope for or expect. 

Although we learn that Falin is mysterious-
ly implicated in the Cold War and, what's 
more, that he is somehow responsible for 
the peaceful resolution of the Cuban mis-
sile crisis, the details of that plotline remain 
almost wholly unstated. When Kit asks 
Falin whether he is "some kind of ... 
agent," he replies cryptically, "Ah. But not 
all agents are secret. And not all secret 
agents are spies." Is the implication that 
Falin as poet somehow saves the world and 
changes the very direction of history? It is 
uncertain, and other details are similarly 
obscure. The full extent of Kit and Falin's 
relationship, for example, remains cloudy, 
even after Kit wakes up one morning in his 
bed. "You were lovers, then, in that sum-
mer?" a Russian scholar asks Kit as Crowley 
zooms out co a conference in St. Petersburg 
thirty years later commemorating what 
would have been Falin's 75th birthday. IGt 
fumbles for a second and then replies, "No, 
no . . . Not then. But yes a little later. Or 
maybe not. I mean ... I'm not sure." It is as 
if Crowley has purposely omitted four or 
five hundred pages of intrigue, action, and 
drama and left us with the more subdued 
interludes. 

This subdued quality is not without 
value, however. Much of the latent excite-
ment of the plot, as well as Crowley's affin-
ity for magical realism, seems "translated" 
into powerful metaphors and images. In 
one striking scene, right before Kit slits her 
wrists, she opens the mirrored door of a 
medicine cabinet, surprised "to find, 
behind her face, not the contents of her-
self," but only toiletries. This poignant 
mirror motif resurfaces throughout the 
work, especially in reference to Lewis 
Carroll's Through the Looking Glass, and 
What Alice Found There. Kit's favorite 
book, Through the Looking Glass comes to 
\.pRJL 2002 
symbolize (perhaps a bit too often) not 
only the Cold War, but also the sort of mir-
ror-image pas-tk-tkux in which she and 
Falin engage throughout the book. 

The verse that Crowley ghostwrites for 
Kit and Falin is an achievement in its own 
right. Few novelists dare to undertake such 
a difficult task. Crowley, though, manages 
both to construct independent voices for 
his two protagonists (though this is a major 
point of contention in the novel: whether 
true translation is possible, or simply "new 
poems") and to write a half dozen or so 
skillful poems. 

It is in this careful attention to lan-
guage, rather than in a grand, bloated plot-
line, that The Translator succeeds most as a 
novel. Precisely by rejecting an epic, multi-
character narrative, Crowley achieves 
something equally magnificient. He does 
not merely revise history; he puts a mysti-
cal, dreamy spin on what it means to be a 
part of it and to articulate ir. In reference to 
a childhood marked by constant relocation, 
Crowley writes of Kit, "To [her], the places 
[her family] lived were vivid, bur she 
remembered them like scenes from novels: 
separate and poignant and hers, but not 
her." In Crowley's own book, he has 
achieved something like this: not so much 
a coherent narrative as a series of punctuat-
ed moments, loosely connected to form a 
story. The Translator's retelling of the Cold 
War centers on individuals whose knowl-
edge of the past is vivid at times and frag-
mented or blurry at others. If nothing else, 
the novel offers a unique and deeply per-
sonal vantage point from which to reflect 
on the mysteries of language, history, and 
time. 

To be sure, The Translator is one of 
Crowley's least ambitious projects in recent 
years. It represents a turn to accessibility for 
an author whose novels have attracted only 
a small, mostly bookish following in the 
past. But this may be more a sign of versa-
tility than senility; Crowley is a profoundly 
talented writer, and he deserves far better 
than to fall through the cracks of history 
like his male protagonist.
