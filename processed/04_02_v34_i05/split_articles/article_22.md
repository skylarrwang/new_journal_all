believes the ruling in
the harassment claim ... was the trig-
gering event in her apparent suicide."
Then again, a college friend insisted that
Julie was stronger than that, and would not
have killed herself over a mishandled
harassment charge. I disagree. Julie was
stalked for over four months while MIT
failed over and over again to do anything
about it. Even in an environment of sup-
posed awareness, institutional safeguards
failed miserably. And that led me to won-
der: Could this happen at a similar institu-
tion? Could it happen at Yale?
No one knows how many women have
been harassed or assaulted because few
complaints are made official.
You may
never know who they are unless a close
friend happens to be one, but even then
silence can prevail; it took nearly four
months before the circumstances sur-
rounding Julie's death were known to any-
one save family and close friends at MIT.
The rest of us read about it in the paper.
Even at Yale, the silence that surrounds sex-
ual harassment conceals the staggering
number of women who have lived through
it.

N 1999, A YALE FRESHMAN NAMED
SARAH was sexually harassed by a junior
professor. A series of comments directed at
her both in and out of class culminated in
his asking Sarah to talk with him privately
about his teaching style. When she refused
to return with him to his apartment, his
comments grew increasingly inappropriate and finally
alone. "He was in his early
thirties, big on gun rights," she told me.
"That was a large contributing factor in my
decision to press charges. He owned lots of
guns, and I didn't like that he knew where
I lived."
Distressed and unable to work, Sarah
spoke to the dean of her residential college,
who contacted Professor Peter Parker, con-
vener of Yale's Sexual
Harassment
Grievance Board, and Dean of Student
Affairs Betty Trachtenberg, -a Board mem-
ber. Sarah did not have the option of pre-
senting her case to Yale College's discipli-
nary tribunal, the Executive Committee,
since
complaints
brought
to
the
Committee must involve only undergradu-
ates. In 1970, when a student first formal-
ly accused a faculty member of harassment,
the University created the Grievance Board
to handle cases like Sarah's.
Technically, the Board's function is
advisory rather than punitive. Board mem-
ber Brian Yolles, an undergraduate, empha-
sizes the Board's role in mediation.
"Ideally, everything can be solved informal-
ly," says Yolles.
"This is tough to bring
before a lot of people and generally not
what the accuser wants."
Frequently, a
student simply needs the Board's assurance
that what took place was harassment. This
validation can go a long way. "The institu-
tion is behind her-she knows he is wrong
and there is no way he can justify his
empowered-this has happened quite a few
times." Board members are quick to point
out the expediency with which a complaint
is handled, especially in potentially danger-
ous situations. When a student lodges a
complaint with the Board, the accused is
informed the same day, and forbidden to
contact the accuser. Any retaliatory acts are
treated as separate incidents.
After speaking with Sarah, Parker and
Trachtenberg met with her instructor and
warned him to keep his distance from her.
He was told to leave a public space should
he find her there and to avoid coming close
to her in any circumstantial meeting. They
advised Sarah to be careful when walking
alone.
Sarah remembers the situation as
extremely difficult. She says she felt "silly"
the whole time. "I wasn't raped, wasn't
attacked," she told me. "You feel like you
should deal with it. You feel silly, like a
whiny girl who couldn't deal." The Board
did offer some help. "Peter Parker told me
that given the situation of power, there
were certain rules, he was supposed to act
certain ways, and what he was doing was
egregious. He made me feel like I had done
the right thing," she said. Yet Sarah feels
that the Board could have done more after
the initial complaint was handled. At the
time, Sarah did not even know that the
Board had official student members whom
she could approach for information and
advice. "There was no particular amount of
follow-up," she says. "I continued to feel
unsafe.
But the situation was handled
pretty quickly-within a week. . . .
Nothing awful happened." In the end,
Sarah did not decide to lodge a formal
complaint. Her instructor was leaving
at the end of the semester, and the
incident was noted on his record.


CASES LIKE SARAH'S AND JULIE'S
illustrate that silence
may be the biggest
threat to resolving sexual harass-
ment issues. Confidentiality is healthy and
necessary for a victim, but potentially detri-
mental to the community as a whole. A
confused, frantic student who brings a con-
cern to the Grievance Board may find a
solution, but her public silence inadver-
tently masks the fact that such incidents
take place on the Yale campus in the first
place. Such silence perpetuates the belief
that sexual harassment and assault do not
occur here--leaving victims feeling isolated
and alone.
The members of the Grievance Board
expressed frustration with the lack of
knowledge about harassment on campus,
citing ignorance as the largest obstacle to
the Board's effectiveness. "This year has
been incredibly uneventful, which can be a
double-edged sword, as I believe that peo-
ple are reluctant to report cases," said
Yolles.
As Stephanie Schmid, a student
Board member, stated, "Reporting, if done
properly, makes people feel less alone and it
encourages more people to feel comfortable
enough to come forward."
Despite the dramatic nature of Julie's
death and the prolonged press coverage,
none of the Board members I spoke to
knew of it. Trachtenberg stressed the gen-
eral inaccessibility of this type of informa-
tion, "We can't possibly know everything
that goes on, and a little bit of knowledge,
some from one source, some from another,
is a dangerous thing. We just don't know
what takes place. We know case studies,
but we clinically can't open a file." While
communication sometimes exists between
individual administrators, professional
confidentiality must be maintained in spe-
cific cases-another ver-
sion of the double-edged sword.
The Board members do recognize a
need for some transparency in the system.
But, as Trachtenberg notes, the mandatory
confidentiality is restricting.
"We give a
pamphlet every year to each student, but a
particular case involving particular students
we can't talk about. And so we're left with
the reputation of not doing anything," she
said. "We cannot say that we had twelve
satisfied customers and their cases were
such and such."
For her part, Sarah suggests that
friendlier forms of advertisement, like
stickers and posters, might soften the
Board's intimidating image.
Describing
her own reluctance to lodge a complaint,
Sarah told me, "You feel as though it has to
be a bad situation and clearly defined.
You're unsure of yourself. You're not going
to go and say that you're unsure--boards
have old white guys on them."
The Board acknowledges these diffi-
culties. Trachtenberg emphasizes that the
Board frequently discusses its effectiveness
as well as the community's perception of it.
"We look at ourselves critically to see how
we're working. I'm not exaggerating about
this. We're always looking." But with the
constant tension between silence and pre-
vention, the only course available may be
vigilance. At MIT, careful vigilance within
the institutional framework might have
saved Julie. "Everything is handled here
until the student is comfortable,"
Yolles said, "but I'm sure people at MIT
would have said the same thing. There's a
bureaucracy ... students often get caught up
in that. Real life moves at rapid paces."
Julie and Sarah both courageously
came forward with their complaints-a
step many victims do not take. For Sarah,
the process was a difficult one despite the
speed with which Yale responded to her
complaint. For Julie, this difficulty became
unbearable when MIT, through rulings and
delays, made her feel like her complaint
was not legitimate and failed to guarantee
that the harassment would not continue.
No institution can eradicate harassment,
but without a system that eradicates a vic-
tim's feelings of inadequacy and isolation,
the next Yale Sarah could end like Julie.
