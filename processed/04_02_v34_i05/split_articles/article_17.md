EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Last November, Yale finalized a deal to 
pay just over $IOo,ooo for the two-acre lot 
at 63 Lock Street-an address that does not 
even lie within a current YPD patrol route. 
For now, it is vacant and overgrown, lit-
tered with bricks and broken bottles, and 
ringed by a sagging chain-link fence with 
holes cut into it. Public housing projects 
and a boarded-up brick building stand 
adjacent to the site, and the stone-walled 
expanse of Grove Street Cemetery shields it 
from the Yale campus irsel£ At dusk, sirens 
drown out the chimes of the carillon issu-
ing from Harkness Tower, just barely visi-
ble to the south. Except for the distant bus-
tle of a pickup basketball game, the block is 
empty. 

But when Perrotti talks about.the site's 
future, he articulates an idyllic vision of a 
bustling police station and community 
center-with the emphasis, of course, on 
community. He elaborates: "We're going to 
be right in the Dixwell community. We 
hope to · have some community meeting 
space in the new building, ~o the commu-
nity can come right to us. We want to facil-
itate tutoring by Yale students." He talks 
about youth athletic leagues, fixing broken 
windows, and getting rid of junk cars. He 
describes premature plans for community 
forums and block parties. He doesn't say 
much about muggings, stolen bikes, laptop 
theft, or breaches in dorm security though. 
When pressed, he shrugs, turns his palms 
upward, and explains, matter-of-facdy, 
"Partnering with the community solves 
more problems." 

T HE ROOTS OF THE YPD are found in the 
same kind of town-gown tensions that 
persist today. In September of 1894, two 
New Haven police officers ;,alked onto the 
Yale campus for the first time. This incur-
sion was, by all accounts, an outrage--a 
violation of an implicit code establishing 
the University as sacrosanct territory, 
exempt from the power of all external 
authorities. The police action had come in 
response to a rash of corpse thefts from 
New Haven cemeteries by Yale medical stu-
dents, culminating a period of general hos:-
tility bet'Ween cown and gown. It was by no 
means a goodwill gesture, and the two offi-
cers, Jim Donnely and Bill Wiser, came 
with the charge to subdue the student body 
and establish the city's policing authority 
on previously exempt territory. Wiser 
recorded those tense early days in his mem-
oirs. "No policemen before this time had 
ventured on these sacred grounds," he 
wrote, "and the campus had come to be 
considered a safe place of refuge for stu-
dents fleeing from the wrath of city police." 
Students reacted with expected resentment 
to this invasion of their "charmed and 
secret enclosure." They dashed with 
Donnely and Wiser over the restriction of 
practices like "tearing down the buildings 
for fire-wood" after football victories and 
"setting fire to the newly-erected electric 
light poles" that "shone into their rooms 
and kept them awake." 

Gradually, however, Donnely and 
Wiser saw their standing among students 
improve, and their role evolved according-
ly. No longer treated as insidious invaders, 
the officers shifted their focus from subdu-
ing students on campus (though the "booz-
