**Had Hill Residents Been More Proactive?**

Had Hill residents instigated their 
protest earlier, would the city have 
responded to their requests? When resi-
dents in the East Rock neighborhood 
learned that the school renovation plan 
included the demolition of residents' 
homes, a committee of parents immediate-
ly put together an extensive report on 22 
alternative sites and hired a lawyer 
to 
defend their property against the city's 
claim of eminent domain. David Cameron, 
a Yale professor and East Rock resident, 
recalls that the construction project was 
halted and the Mayor "created a different, 
more public process." 


Pastor Drews remains convinced that 
"that middle-class neighborhood of East 
Rock was treated incredibly differently." 
Sitting in her office, which is cluttered with 
drafts of sermons and city contracts, Pastor 
Drews contends "that it would seem to me 
in the u.s. you give equal treatment to 
neighborhoods of all classes. This is a poor, 
disempowered neighborhood, and it's diffi-
cult for people to see that they can oppose 
this." Drews believes that the apathy of Hill 
residents should have motivated the city to 
reach out to the community, and Cameron 
agrees. "Residents in East Rock most likely 
had more sources of information, more 
resources. We got information that the Hill 
residents weren't able to get." 


Walking down Ward Street, Pastor 
Drews points out three houses just named 
as part of a historic district that will soon 
be demolished. "These houses have been 
home to immigrants for 100 years and they 
are still standing," Drews says, "Even 
immigrants of modest means, a hundred 
years ago, were provided housing that had 
dignity, design and enabled them to live 
with a sense of respect. Now it's just 
blight." But the blight that we so often 
associate with neglect tells a different story 
in the Hill neighborhood-the story of res-
idents trying too late to empower them-
selves; and a city trying too hard to do 
what's best.
