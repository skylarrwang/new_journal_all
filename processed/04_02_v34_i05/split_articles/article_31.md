**Title: New Haven's Beeping Stoplights**

NEW HAVEN: HOME OF Pepe's pizza, Louis' 
burgers, sons and daughters of Eli, and the 
only buzzing, beeping, count-down savvy, 
two-way walk traffic lights I know. When I 
first encountered the beeping traffic light 
outside of Commons two years ago, I was 
taken aback. I stood and watched a few 
cycles of red and green. Back then, the light 
on the corner of Grove and College merely 
chirped. Now, it beeps and counts crossable 
time down from 30. If New Haven traffic 
controls continue to evolve at this rate, 
stoplights may soon be running the city. 

This breed of vocal stoplight is rapidly 
multiplying throughout New Haven. 

Sentient traffic lights can now be found at 
Chapel Â·and Temple, York_ and Elm, and 
Grove and Whitney. I was eager to learn 
more about these marvels of traffic-control 
technology. So I called Ernie LeGoya at 
the 
Connecticut 
Department 
of 
Transportation. He immediately informed 
me that when it comes to regulating traffic, 
New Haven is something of a renegade 
municipality. While the DOT manages traf-
fic for many Connecticut cities, LeGoya 
told me that "New Haven likes to be in 
charge of all their signals. They even do all 
their own painting. You know, the yellow 
on the curbs." LeGoya was kind enough to 
help me get in touch with the people in 
charge. 

Bruce Fischer of New Haven Traffic 
Control was baffled by my keen interest in 
his job. Explaining my mission, I began 
throwing questions at him. His responses 
were elusive: "You might think we're doing 
some things that we're not." Hmm. But 
why, I insisted, does New Haven have such 
unusual stoplights? Fischer explained that 
be and his staff were simply responding to 
public demand. The beeping stoplights are 
for the visually impaired, and the count-
downs arrived as a solution to the com-
plaint from senior citizens that they didn't 
have enough time to cross. "Older people 
got scared," he explains. The pre-count-
down era stoplights had eight seconds of 
white "walk" and then twelve seconds of 
flashing red "don't walk." The flashing was 
supposed to inform the pedestrian to finish 
crossing the street and to warn pedestrians 
on the curb not to begin. Fischer and the 
department received many complaints 
from elderly residents. "They saw the flash-
ing begin when they were half-way across 
the street and they thought they were sup-
posed to turn around." Fortunately, the 
countdown gives the ful[ allotted time. 

Fischer elaborated, "We just try to respond 
to the needs of an area." The countdown 
stoplight makes perfect sense: Who would-
n't love to get old people out of the middle 
of the road? 

As Fischer became more and more 
excited, he lost his reserve and revealed the 
secrets behind New Haven's advanced stop-
light technology. "We have a staff of people 
interested in the new technology. We see a 
new light and say 'Gee! We want that new 
. kind of walkway here!"' Fischer said proud-
ly, The truth is, the countdown stoplight 
has not been approved by all DOT's. In fact, 
the state opposes New Haven's use of the 
countdowns. Personally, I'm glad we have 
Fischer on the job. He has a bold vision for 
the future of intersections around New 
Haven. Some day, those boring yellow 
poles at every corner may begin to vibrate 
when the walk signal is up--a service for 
the seeing and hearing impaired. Crossing 
the street could become a sensory extrava-
ganza. 

Fischer's mission goes well beyond 
stoplights. He is every pedestrian's friend. 
"We want to make it easier for people to 
walk." Years ago, for example, Broadway 
was one wide street. The city and the 
University worried about students crossing 
at various locations, so they cooperated and 
built the parking lot and walkway system 
that now divide the street. Fischer's depart-
ment directs our feet, and the walls and 
marked waJkways make crossing Broadway 
a safe and even pleasant experience. 

Unfortunately, traffic lights and traffic 
laws are consistently abused. New Haven 
citizens-Yale students especially-take 
jaywalking to new extremes. The biggest 
problem for New Haven officials is the 
stretch of Elm Street at:weert 
College and ~ 
weekday arounJ 11:20 AM, 
cars must stop in their rradc.s 
as droves of eager 'Stude ts 
edge out into the streef. Fischer 
astutely observes, "People take 
shortest route. To encourage people 
to walk to the cross street is very dif-
ficult, especially young people dash-
ing across the street." Fischer and the 
department have talked about placing 
waist-high New York-style fences along the 
curb. He expects that there will be substan-
tial opposition and made it dear that it is 
only an idea. ''I'm only projecting that. It's 
a distant possibility." 

As you dart diagonally across the 
Comrnons-sss intersection, you probably 
aren't thinking about Bruce Fischer or the 
DOT, nor do you realize that you are break-
ing a city ordinance that Fischer takes quite 
seriously. I asked Fischer about the "diago-
nal cross" phenomenon (as I naively 
termed it). He didn't understand what I 
meant. 

I tried again in more technical 
terms, and soon we were on the same page. 
"Oh you mean the protected pedestrian 
phase? That is not a diagonal cross time." 
Fischer warned explicitly that no one 
should ever be crossing the street diagonal-
ly, even if the lights are beeping and count-
ing down. "I'm just trying to protect the 
most vulnerable people," Fischer told me in 
our conversation. The "protected pedestri-
an phases" are part of an intricate light pro-
gram intended to coordinate pedestrian 
and vehicular paths in the safest, most effi-
cient manner. The beep and countdown are 
there for our safety. They are a New Haven 
privilege, and yet we continue to disrespect 
the beep, the countdown, and the double 
walk, increasing our vulnerability with each 
"diagonal cross."
