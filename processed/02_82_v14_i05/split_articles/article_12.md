Everyone knows there was no strike. 


But few people understand what came 
out of Th~ Agreemmt b~tw~m Yal~ Univer-
siry and tM Ftdnation of Universiry 
Employus Local No. 35. The document 
is called an agreement, but the two 
parties that signed it disagree on what 
it means both for themselves and for 
the Yale community. 


They disagree, for example, on one 
of the Union's most important con-
cerns: job security. Under the terms of 
the new contract, employees in the 
bargaining unit who have worked at 
Yale for 10 years or more cannot be 
laid ofT for lack of work for the dura-
tion of the contract. The Union inter-
prets this provision to mean that a 
worker has a guaranteed right to his or 
her own job after 10 years of service to 
Yale. But the University maintains 
that the language of the contract does 
not prevent it from reassigning those 
workers to a different job, even if the 
job is in a lower wage scale. 


"What if something happened in the 
energy department and we decided all 
of the people in the power plant were 
going to be changed to something 
else," Donald Stevens, Director of 
Employee Relations and chief nego-
tiator for the University explained. 
The contract "says that all of those peo-
ple with 10 years of experience will be 
given some other position." 


Stevens described the process the 
University would use to give jobs to 
the workers protected by the contract 
as a "bumping down" process. "They 
don't maintain their own position, but • 
they use their seniority to bump down 
somebody else," he said. 


If the Administration's interpreta-



tion is correct, most of the concessions 
won by the Union on job security 
would mean effectively nothing. For 
example, the University could under 
certain circumstances 
transfer a 
Locksmith making S9.91 an hour to 
another position 
like 
Elevator 
Operator or Pantry Worker, where his 
skills would be useless, the work 
disagreeable, and the pay several 
dollars an hour less. After 15 or so 
years of being a Locksmith, he would 
most likely be driven away from the 
University, which would make the 
transfer into an effective layoff. 


The Union disagrees forcefully with 
Stevens' interpretation. 


"I'm interested if that's his inter-
pretation, because it's fundamentally 
wrong," said John Wilhelm, Business 
Manager and chief negotiator for 
Local 35, "If they stuck with that posi-
tion, we'd arbitrate it," he added. 


"There's no question we would win." 


Wilhelm cited a 1979 ruling by an 
impartial arbitrator that "the term 
'layoff' means 'from your own job.'" 


That ruling, made under the terms of 
the 1977 contract, precludes transfer-
ring a worker to another position. 


Most likely, the arbitration ruling 
still holds up, because the changes 
made in the new agreement do not 
depart significantly from the old con-
tract. Arbitration has a status similar 
to legal precedence; it is subject to 
review, but cannot be changed unless 
the factors surrounding the case have 
changed or the impartial arbitrator can 
be proven incorrect. 


"If that ruling is in order, the 
University wouldn't have a chance," if 
they took this statute before an ar-
bitrator, said Julius Getman, a Yale 
Law Professor who specializes in labor 
law. 


If the University cannot transfer 
employees at will, then the Union has 
won 
some substantial 
protection 
against layoffs by obtaining some small 
changes in the contract. The old con-
tract specified that no employees "shall 
be laid off for lack of work during the u-
mainder of the University fiscal year, • which 
begins and ends every July 1 . The 
language of the new contract reads 
"during the term of this agreement," 
which expires on January 17, 1985. 


Those few words give the Union a 
lot more job protection than they 
might seem to contain at f~rst sight. If 
the Union refuses to let the University 
remove that provision the next time 
the contract is renegotiated, then any 
worker with 10 years of service at Yale 
can hold his job as long as he wants it. 


"Assuming we retain that provision 
in the future, it protects those workers 
permanently," Wilhelm said. 


Who won? 


The 
Union 
and 
the 
University 
disagree not only on the issue of job 
security, but also on the more general 
question of who made the most conces-
sions at the bargaining table. Wilhelm 
maintains that the new agreement con-
tains "major breakthroughs in the non-
economic area ... including very 
strong new language on job security." 


Stevens maintains that the Union "did 
not get more than we can give an a 
reasonable fashion." 


"If they 
think 
they 
won, 
I'm 
delighted, because we think we won 
and that's what counts," Wilhelm said. 


The Union did get a number of 
benefits. Apart from the disputed 
clause on job security, it won full 
coverage of medicaJ costs for spouses 
and retired employees; a commitment 
by the University to make "good faith 
consultations" on how to reorganize 
departments, improve work load prob-
"In sheer power terms we 
don't have the ability to crlp· 
pie the University." 
lems, supply equipment and create 
entirely new jobs where they are need-
ed; a streamlined grievance procedure 
with penalties on the University for not 
acting on a filed grievance within a set 
time period; a commitment to pay 50 
per cent of tuition for classes taken by 
an employee; new strong language on 
sub-contracting; and an extended sick 
leave. 


But the Union accepted a small 
wage proposal to get these concessions. 
In the Union's original proposal made 
last November, it sought a 15 per cent 
across the board raise and a higher 
Cost of Living Allowance (COLA). 
That figure dropped over the next few 
weeks to 12 per cent, then nine per 
cent, and finally, six per cent three 
days before the contract was due to ex-
pire. In the last minute compromise, 
the negotiating committee agreed to a 
meager 1. 4 per cent raise with the 
same COLA from the old contract in 
exchange for the new language and 
benefits. 


"In every respect but wages, it's an 
outstanding proposal," Wilhelm 
reportedly told the workers before they 
voted whether or not to accept the con-
tract. "If you want to strike, do so on 
the wage issue and the Union leader-
ship will support you." 


The Union believes it got a good 
deal even with the low wage increase 
because it had already corrected the 
problem of salary in the past. In 1968, 
when Local 35 had its first strike, the 
workers' wages were scarcely above the 
minimum wage. Now three strikes 
later they are among the highest paid 
dining hall and maintenance workers 
in the country. 


"We've had the luxury of being able 
to concentrate on [other benefits] but 
it's a luxury we've created ourselves by 
the economic progress that we've made
