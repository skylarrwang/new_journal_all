' After 20 years of imprisonment in China, john Downey prepares to go home. 
He says he is not bitter about his im-
prisonment; the CIA had warned its 
agents that if they were captured the 
agency would not claim them, and he 
still feels the CIA is an "essential agen-
cy in the tough world we live in." In his 
public statements, Downey seems to 
pass off his 20 years in jail as nothing 
more than a nuisance, a minor setback 
in the life story of a successful Yalie. 

During his years of confinement, 
Downey said he remained patriotic 
even as news trickled through about his 
country's 
growing disillusionment. 

The Chinese let him receive outside 
magazines, including Time, Newsweek, 
and the Yale Alumni Magazine. Downey 
said he was able to keep abreast of the 
major developments of the sixties: the 
anti-war movement, the civil rights 
movement, Yale-Harvard football 
scores, and the advent of coeducation. 

After President Nixon's trip to 
China in 1973, Downey ·was finally 
released. His campai~n brochures to-
day include a picture of him crossing 
the border into Hong Kong. 

Downey said he had no troubles ad-
justing to his new freedom, but he was 
perplexed by the national mood upon 
his return to the U.S. "I considered the 
despair and Joss of faith in the system, 
especially during Water~ate, somewhat 
preposterous after what I'd seen in 
China." He decided to become active 
in politics because he was concerned 
with this "loss of purpose." 

Before embarking on a political 
career, he went back to school for a law 
degree. After graduating from Har-
vard 
Law 
School 
and marrying 
Audrey Lee, a graduate student at 
Yale, Downey began to practice Jaw in 
Wallingford, 
commuting from 
his 
home in New Haven. 

In 1978, Downey made an attempt 
to run for Lieutenant Governor of 
Connecticut. Although he received few 
votes, he feels the lesson was a valuable 
introduction to politics. At the time, he 
also met Governor Ella Grasso, who 
was to become his political mentor. 
She appointed him to the chairman-
ship of the Public Utilities Control 
Authority (PUCA) in 1978. 

Downey learned a lot in a short 
period of time under Grasso's political 
tutelage. "She was a terrific lady. The 
Hong Kong Information Services 
most intelligent person I've ever met. 
And she knew more about politics than 
anybody. She realized it was a largely 
symbolic affair, the benevolent gover-
nor sweeping down on the disaster-
struck town, then sweeping right out 
again." 

Downey did a creditable job at 
PUCA, balancing the interests of con-
sumer groups and financially pressed 
utility companies, and managing to 
alienate neither group. He resigned 
last April in order to "explore" the 
possibilities of a Senate run. 

After making hi~ candidacy formal in 
October 1981, Downey began to cam-
paign for the Democratic nomination. 
But his inexperiel'lce on the campaign 
trail qmckly showed through. "I think 
I'm better qualified to be a U.S. 
Senator than I am to campaign for the 
Senate," he said. "The important thing 
is that I'm learning as I go along." 

Although he was well-known in 
political circles, his name carried little 
recognition among voters when he first 
announced. His wife Audrey jokes 
about his relations with the media: 
"Before .Jack used to run away from the

Alumni 
Magazine. 

cameras. Now he looks for them." 

Recently, 
Downey 
has begu-n 
to 
receive increased attention in the 
press, with front page stories in the 
Hartford Courant and the Boston Globe. 

He has had trouble finding the 
money for a statewide campaign. So 
far he has raised a paltry S80,000 
"without a really cohesive fund raising 
effort." This figure is half as much as 
what his better-connected rival in the 
Democratic race claims to h<we raised. 

Downey has targeted $750,000 as his 
goal to be raised by the summer mon-
ths, and he estimates that the entire 
campaign could cost as much as S2 
million. 

But 
Downey's 
most 
formidable 
challenge is overcoming the advantage 
that most political analysts have given 
Toby Moffett, 
the popular and 
charismatic Sixth District Connecticut 
Congressman who announced his can-
didacy for the Democratic nomination 
in December. Downey has until the 
nominating convention in May to win 
20 per cent of the state's delell'ates in 
•order to torce Moffett into a state 
primary. 

"Obviously, I think it's winnable," 
said Downey. "Moffett will fade in the 
·long haul and I think even Weiker, the 
Republican senator, is vulnerable." 

Prescott Bush, a Yale graduate and 
brother of the Vice President has 
agreed with Downey's assessment. In 
January, Bush declared his candidacy 
for the R epublican nomination against 
incumbent Weiker. 

Downey is counting on support from 
conservative 
Democrats hopefully 
alienated by what he calls 
"Moffett's 
musty, outmoded brand of politics." 

As a fiscal conservative and advocate 
of an aggressive 
foreign 
policy, 
Downey has begun to attack Moffett's 
liberal positions on social services and 
defense spending. Although initially 
cautious about taking stands on issues, 
Downey has become increasingly can-
did about his views. He is a strong sup-
porter of defense appropriations for· 
Israel and the establishment of a peace 
keeping force in the Sinai. He has also 


denounced Reaganomic cutbacks in 
social welfare as well as the betrayal of 
the Democratic Party by its more 
liberal members. 

He feels he has some knowledge of 
Connecticut's e nergy problems 
because of his work at PUCA. He has 
proposed several ways to solve the 
state's outrageous electricity rates, in-
cluding the use of Canadian hydro-
power. The basic goal, said Downey, is 
to reduce dependence on oil, whether 
by converting oil plants to coal, or in-
creasing the number of nuclear plants 
in the state. 

Downey's support has picked up 
around the state as his campaigning 
has improved and his recognition has 
increased. While he started out with 
strong support among New Haven 
Democrats 
including 
Mayor 
Ben 
DiLieto and Democratic Chairman 
Vincent Mauro, 
his list of en-
dorsements has grown to include state 
"House of Representatives Majority 
Leader J ohn Groppo, and Yale Law 
School Dean of Admissions Jim 
Thomas. These men all serve on the 
65-member statewide steering commit-
tee. 

Just how strong this support will 
prove in the eventual showdown with 
Moffett remains a question on which 
not even Downey will speculate. But 
whatever the eventual outcome of the 
race, Downey is a man who has 
learned that time is on his side.
