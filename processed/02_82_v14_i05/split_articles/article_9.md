Fear and loathing 
at 
Career Advisory 
Walter Jacob 
January 18 was a pretty hectic day for 
the folks over at the Yale Career Ad-
visory and Placement Service. Seems 
like they had about 43 per cent more 
seniors than usual lining up for their 
On Campus Recruiting Program this 
year, and a whole bunch forgot about 
the deadline for turning in resumes. 
Ed Noyes, Director of Career Ad-
visory, said he was a little peeved when 
50 people he'd never even laid eyes on 
jammed the halls near closing time 
looking for a steady income. But he 
was still gratified to find people's opin-
ions changing about his line of work. 
"When I first got here," he rem-
inisced, "it really seemed like students 
ran home, got out of their good clothes 
and into their jeans so nobody'd fmd 
out they were coming here." 
Times have changed. What with 
unemployment creeping up near nine 
per cent and all, Mr. Noyes figures 
people are naturally just getting antsy 
about not having a place to hang their 
hats come May. And Mr. Noyes has a 
right to his opinion. Its just that things 
looked a little different from my point 
of view. 
I guess I chose the wrong day to go 
pick up an LSAT application form. I'd 
ignored the resume deadline warnings 
because I wasn't interested in the pro-
gram, but if I'd known they were stag-
ing a trial run of the Last Judgement, I 
would've brought popcorn. 
I ran into a couple of friends coming 
out of the door at 1 Hillhouse and 
mopping the sweat from their brows. 
"Hey, can I borrow your typewriter? 
I've gotta write my resume." 
"Hey, what're you going to do next 
year, anyway?" 
They looked pretty pleased with 
themselves, but I had this funny feel-
ing that if they had had tails they 
would have been holding them be-
tween their legs. 
Inside the windows were starting to 
steam up, but people were in too much 
of a hurry to take off their down 
jackets. Those who weren't running to 
beat the clock were looking at their 
shoes as if they wished they could fit 
more of themselves inside of them. I 
recognized a woman maki'tg herself 
small under an enormous recruiting 
Walt.,Jecob 
poster in the crowded corridor. 
"Last chance to get interviewed by 
Proctor and Gamble," she offered 
weakly, 
shielding her interview 
preference list with a sheaf of papers. 
The back room was the main attrac-
tion. That's where everybody was go-
ing through the job directories in a 
panic and writing down anything that 
looked worthwhile, and scribbling 
names on scraps of paper and holding

their heads and moaning about lost 
ideals. Some didn't even have time for 
that; they just entrusted their fortunes 
to the fates and copied down somebody 
else's preference list. I heard some 
great lines. 
"I need a job objective. Gimme a job 
objective." 
"You're into marketing. Didn't you 
say you wanted to go into marketing?" 
"Well, no. I mean yes! Oh, for 
Christ's sake!" 
And then there was the throng that 
had already finished their applications 
and could laugh about it, sporting one 
broad collective grin like the Israelites 
on the far shores of the Red Sea. One 
hooted to those still toiling: "Hey, 
how're you gonna pay the rent, huh?" 
Somebody had pinned up a hand-
scrawled sign that seemed to sum up 
the whole scene. 
"Welcome to the real world." 
Not that I think most of us are going 
to see a lot of the real world that most 
people know after we graduate. After 
all, Ed Noyes says even students with 
no technical background who get a job 
through his service will average around 
S 1 7,500 a year for a starting salary. 
That's S3,000 ahead of the national 
average for graduating liberal arts peo-
ple he says. And those with math or 
science backgrounds will be landing 
jobs at between $22,000 and $24,000, 
first time out. 
But it seemed like that sign almost 
sanctioned what was going on at 1 
Hillhouse that day; almost told those 
folks who were scrambling to make the 
deadline, to just fill those embarrassing 
blanks on the application form and 
pass the damned thing in so they'd still 
be runners in the race, that it was okay 
to tum off the brain and turn on the 
juice. 
It wasn't so much a question of look-
ing out for number one, you see. It was 
all those fears of the unplanned future, 
all those prying questions the parents 
and relatives asked over Christmas 
break, all those friends getting into 
nedical school, all those decisions that 
are so tough to make on your own. 
Sure, some people knew . what they 
wanted in a job and grabbed for it ear-
ly. But the ones bending over the 
reference books that afternoon didn't 
seem to want to know. The hour of the 
weighing of souls was at hand, and 
more than poverty, more than humil-
iation, more than betraying all those 
principles they had always held dear, 
the people I saw seemed to fear the 
responsibility of charting independent 
courses. They weren't applying for jobs 
because unemployment was up. They 
were applying because the deadline 
had come. They didn't need a better 
reason. They had indeed entered the 
real world, where things just get done a 
lot quicker if you shut up and stop ask~ 
ing questions. 
Ed Noyes says he thinks the crowds 
in his halls show that students are giv-
ing more consideration to business 
careers now than in the recent pcut. I 
don't think what's going on here has 
much to do with business or with con-
sidered opinions. From what fve seen, 
it looks like just another manifestation 
of that invincible human penchant for 
blind conformity. And I don't know 
why anybody should hesitate to con-
demn it.
