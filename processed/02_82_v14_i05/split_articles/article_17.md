EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
A scene from Fugard's Boesman and Lena 
can decide the man you're going to be, 
which was, in a sense, an equivalent 
moment for Piet Bezuidenhout when 
he'd stop his bus and listen to those 
(black) people and they slapped him on 
the back and they welcomed him, and 
he realized, as Master Harold has got 
to realize, that to sit on a "whites only" 
bench is to do something as profoundly 
damaging to yourself as it is to do 
something damaging to Sam. I just 
think that the South African ex-
perience involves that radical degree of 
choice. I've talked to young Ameri-
cans, I've talked to old Americans, I've 
talked to middle-aged Americans, and 
their sense of a radical choice is not 
very profound, whereas in South 
Africa it is, and to the extent that you 
get poised on going one way or the 
other, the degree of ambiguity and am-
bivalence must of necessity operate. 

H vS: An interesting thing about Piet 
Bezuidenhout is that at first, yes, he 
stops his bus. The moment of curiosity 
becomes a moment, very soon, of 
political transformation. H owever, by 
the end of the play, one has the feeling 
that, in spite of the clear , radical 
choices Piet has made, he is left dangl-
ing.
