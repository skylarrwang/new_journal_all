For most candidates, a campaign for a 
seat in the U.S. Senate is a product of 
many years of political preparation, a 
carefully constructed resume, and the 
cultivation of political and media con-
tacts. But John Downey, Yale class of 
1951 and a candidate for the 1982 
Democratic Senatorial nomination in 
Connecticut, has had to make up for 
lost time. For 20 years Downey sat in a 
Chinese prison camp, captured as a 
CIA agent during the Korean War. 

Only for the past three years has he 
pursued a political career. 

The first Democrat to enter the 
Senate race this year, Downey formal-
ly announced his candidacy October 
20, 1981 at a party at the Piccadilly 
Square Restaurant in New Haven. He 
took a stand against most of Reagan-
omics and called for federal protection 
of minority rights and care for the im-
poverished 'and elderly. After the 
speech, 
he 
shook 
bands with 
everybody he possibly could, yet his 
actions seemed harried- this was not 
the practiced slickness of an experi-
enced politician, but the effort of a 
man learning a new style. 

The eldest son of a judge probate in 
Wallingford, and the grandson of the 
chairman of the Wallingford town 
council, Downey said he "grew up with 
the ideal of public service in mind." 
Because success in politics meant get-
ting the best 
education 
possible, 
Downey attended the Choate School in 
Wallingford where he graduated in 
1947 before coming to Yale. 

In college Downey was more active 
in sports than politics. He played 
center on the football team and was a 
heavyweight wrestler, while majoring 
in English and working in the library. 
He was"' lso a member of St. Anthony's 
Hall. Downey said he always adm1red 
the diversity of student talent. "My 
roommates were involved in different 
things," he said. "One was a newsie. I 
played football. But at night we'd get 
together and talk about the things we'd 
done that day. That's how I learned 
the most, in those late night talks." 

While Downey attended Yale, the 
Korean War was in progress. "There 
was a clear sense of duty, a belief that 
we had to rid the world of the Soviet 
threat," Downey said. The political 
mood at Yale in the early 1950s was 
marked by a conservatism and a 
search for personal security above all 
else. "We were filled with a sense of 
elitism," Downey said. "I don't know if 
that's changed." A passage from the 
1951 Yale Banner reads: "A time of 
uncertainty . . . that is what the year 
was to most of us ... Would we crush 
the North Koreans? was question 
number one." 

Downey's sense of duty led him to 
service with the CIA upon graduation. 
After a training course in Texas, 
where half the participants were Yale, 
Harvard or Princeton graduates, he 
was shipped to Japan for 11 months in 
preparation for service in Korea. On 
his second mission contacting Chinese 
agents behind enemy lines, Downey's 
plane was shot down. After his cap-
!ure, he was sent to prison in China, -
where he was given a life sentence. The 
CIA refused to admit he was an agent, 
and negotiations for his relea_Â§e made 
little progress. 

Although 
the Chinese never 
physically abused Downey, he said, 
they did subject him to much psycho-
logical torment and solitary confine-
ment. "It was a very stressful situation. 
I was isolated from the normal prison 
life. They wanted us to believe that our 
people had given up on us, something I 
never fell for." Once, during the later 
years of his capture, he was ordered to 
clean out 
a 
room 
in which he 
discovered a mail bag full of Christmas 
letters and well wishes from Wall-
ingford children that had been kept 
from him. 

Downey tried to make the best of his 
years in prison. "You learn to keep 
busy. I think that's the key to life. I 
would get up, exercise for an hour, 
wash, study for a few hours (I studied 
Russian for many years), listen to an 
English language radio broadcast, take 
part in the Mao study group, exercise 
some more, sew, clean. I did a lot of 
shoveling snow, things like that. Youv 
do a lot of thinking. You learn that the 
world goes on without you. You learn 
patience."
