**A Review of Agon**
**Author: Elizabeth Wahl**
**Page number(s): 38-39**

Reading Harold Bloom's Agon for the 
first time gives one the peculiar and 
rather exhausting sensation of treading 
water in a bottomless sea. And then 
suddenly, when it seems as if the waves 
are going to close over one's head, the 
author draws his ideas together tightly 
in a net that saves the reader from 
drowning in the wash of his inter-
pretive forays. Agon is a unique work of 
literary theory, combining elements of 
philosophy, 
religion, and psycho-
analysis, as well as the close reading of 
a text, traditionally associated with 
literary criticism. 


Following A Map of Misruuiing, the 
book develops a theory of revisionism, 
a "reseeing" of literary works from one 
man's unusual and perceptive vision. 
Bloom sets th e background for this vi-
sion against the history of the gnostic 
tradition 
which 
he defmes as a 
knowledge of what is oldest in oneself, 
an "agon" or contest between a rational 
or intellectual interpretation of an idea 
and a 
more emotional, instinctive 
response to it. He defends the mode of 
criticism which he terms "misprision" 
or a strong "misreading" of a text, in 
his own case to ask of a text "what is it 
good for? What can it do for me? What 
can I make it mean?" H e writes, 
"American criticism 
ought to 
be 
outrageous and pragmatic." The con-
clusions drawn in Agon are both. 


Bloom has chosen to consider a wide 
variety of authors from Valentinius to 
Emerson to Freud as well as the 
literary genre of fantasy and what he 
calls the Sublime in mOdern literature. 
Such a smorgasbord of topics might 
appear to be rather farflung for any 
series of critical discussion to do them 
justice, but Bloom maintains a sense of 
coherence by the steadiness of his tone 
and constancy to his gnostic mode of 
interpretation. 


His discussions of Emerson and 
Whitman are his most successful. Both 
serve as frequent sources of quotation, 
their works seeming to embody for 
Bloom the eloquent expression of a 
Gnosis akin to his own. Both Emerson

and Whitman disavow Western liter-
ary tradition for a more personal self-
knowledge. Thus Emerson saw Ameri-
can poetry taking on the tremendous 
task of displacing Shakespeare which 
Bloom observes is the "doomed enter-
prise that shadows Moby Die/c. • And 
Bloom finds in Whitman an embodi-
ment of this peculiarly American poetic 
defiance. He executes a marvellous 
close-reading of Whitman's "Song of 
Myself," carefully and meticulously ex-
amining the intricacies and implica-
tions of each cited passage. 


Having thus connected Emerson 
and Whitman in the context of the 
development of an American poetic 
voice, Bloom abruptly changes pace by 
giving his own theory of fantasy in 
literature. This is his stated intent, but 
the chapter is just as much a defense of 
one of the author's favorite works of 
this genre, David Linsey's A Voyage to . 
Arcturus. It is difficult to separate 
Bloom's theory of fantasy from all the 
excess literary jargon surrounding it• 
but he seems to imply that fantasy as a 
literary form is structurally flawed; 
ultimately it cannot describe the unreat 
in terms that transcend literary con-
vention. 


J n choosing to illustrate this view 
with a book as little-known as Voyage to 
Arcturus, Bloom does the reader a 
disservice. By the time he has finished 
giving the names of the major 
characters and places 
and their 
allegorical meanings, the reader is so 
confused that he has lost sight of the 
point Bloom is trying to make. 


Fortunately, the concluding chap-
ters of Agon return their attention to a 
consideration of individual authors 
and how they are connected, begin-
ning with a short but convincing study 
of Wallace Stevens. This is Bloom at 
his critical best, dissecting a text not 
with surgical detachment, but with an 
intense spiritual love of language as 
well as content. Bloom is a writer and 
critic of no small subtlety and complex-
ity. In many instances, his ideas are 
almost inaccessible, especially when he 
retreats behind a barrier of obscure 
literary references. Yet he seldom loses 
• sight of his stated purpose in any 
meditation. Whether one agrees with 
his observations or takes exception to 
the means by which he draws his con-
clusions, one cannot help but be 
fascinated by his unique method of 
"reseeing" a text and his intense per-
sonal 
involvement 
m 
the act of 
criticism.
