About thla laaue 
One of the biggest editorial 
challenges we face is matching people 
with ideas, the right writer with the 
right story. We were particularly ex-
cited when Heinrich von Staden, 
Master of Ezra Stiles College, agreed 
to interview South African playwright 
Athol Fugard whose new play opens 
at the Yale Rep on March 12 . 
Von Staden grew up in South 
Africa and is a friend of Fugard. The 
interview, conducted earlier this 
month at Kavanagh's was an. emo-
tional reunion for the two men who 
hadn't seen each other in two years. 
During the course·of their conversa-
tion, they were frequently interrupted 
by people who affectionately praised 
Fugard and welcomed him back to 
New Haven. 
On another note, we'd like to con-
~ 
gratulate Paul Hofheinz and Jim 
Lowe who have been elected 
Associate Editors. This will be the 
fifth issue on which they have worked 
-
not only writing articles and 
editing copy, but also helping with 
business and production. 
Lowe is a freshman in Morse who 
wrote the article on the Political 
Union's identity crisis. Hofheinz is a 
sophomore in Silliman who wrote this 
issue's cover story on the new union 
contract. Hofheinz first began 
covering the labor beat last April. He 
wrote this story after carefully 
examining the new contract's terms in 
an attempt to sort out the union and 
university's claims and counterclaims. 
We think the story of organized labor 
,.
at Yale is one of the most complex 
and important stories on campus 
because it so greatly affects the cost 
and quality of life. 
Hope you enjoy this issue.
