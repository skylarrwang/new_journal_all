Yale's Donald Stevens sent them. Moreover, Local 35 began to distribute cards last fall Ollf which they will need the signatures of 30 per cent of the work force, around 800 people at Yale, to call for an election. Until that time, the Union had worked on establishing a rank and file committee of around 500 workers with at least one employee from every department at Yale. All of this means that white collar workers might have to decide sometime this spring whether or not they want union representation. 

With the prospect of a clerical and technical union lurking in the background, the University and the Union have an added stake in how the community perceives them and the contract. The UAW first approached Local 35 about withdrawing their organizing drive on Thursday, January 14, three days before the contract expired, but it withheld the announcement until after the settlement, perhaps so as not to cause the University to push the Union into a strike to take the steam out of its organizing drive. 

Both the University and the Union have taken much advantage of the Yale press to put forward their interpretations of the contract. "This contract should be a source of inspiration for the University clerical and technical employees," Sam Issacharoff wrote in an editorial in the Yale Daily News. Days later, Wilhelm followed up with a letter to the editor calling attention to the increases in blue collar wages from the COLA, something which white collar workers do not have. At the same time, Stevens gave much play to the "cents per hour" increase that the blue collar workers got in an unsigned article he wrote for the Weekly Bulletin and Calendar. He pointed out that the weighted salary increase was only 1.4 per cent per year, as well as that the old COLA, which is also in the new contract,only provides quarterly increases at 40 per cent the rate of inflation. 

And so, Yale and the Union find themselves once again on opposite sides of the bargaining table. While negotiations between the two parties have ended, the dialogue about how to interpret The Agreement between Yale University and the Federation of University Empwyees Local No. 35 goes on. Perhaps the real winner of this past contract settlement was not the Union, or the University, but the Yale community, who for only the second time in 14 years will go three years without a strike of one of its most essential work forces. 

"Quite frankly, I'm somewhat surprised we're not out on the streets," Wilhelm commented after it was all over. 

They are not out on the streets, and that in itself is quite an accomplishment. 

"I'm interested if that's his interpretation because it's fundamentally wrong."
