forced to confront the realities of 
limited resources. Comforted by this 
misperception of abundance, they ig-
nore environmental dilemmas. 


The "Global 2000 Report to the 
President," published in 1980 by the 
Council on Environmental Quality 
and the State Department, sums up the 
rather bleak outlook. The report con-
cludes, "If present trends continue, the 
world in 2000 will be more crowded, 
more polluted, less stable ecologically, 
and more vulnerable to disruption 
than the world we live in now." 


Without an appreciation for the en-
vironment, the world cannot avoid this 
ominous fate. 


Environmental laws 
may handcuff the most visible of-
fenders, but they do nothing to change 
cultural attitudes. The government has 
been equally ineffective. Since the 
publication of Global 2000, it has cut 
dramatically the budgets of the Interior 
Department and the Environment 
Protection Agency. Interior Secretary 
James Watt's controversial policies fur-
ther emphasize the need for a better in-
formed society which can responsibly 
evaluate environmental questions. 


While the future demands a basic 
awareness of environmentaJ 
pre-
dicaments, it also affords a variety of 
career opportumues. Engineering and 
computer science may have drawn the 
most attention as up-and-coming 
fields, but most people do not realize 
the wealth of available environmental-
ly related careers. 


Other Ivy League schools, such as 
Brown, Princeton and Harvard, all 
share a stronger commitment to en-
vironmental education than does Yale. 
Brown offers a major, and Princeton 
and Harvard refer interested students 
to the appropriate facuJty members 
and departments. 


Wolf, Smith and Forestry Dean 
WilJiam 
Smith have sought im-
provements in environmental studies 
at Yale. Dean Smith suggests the ap-
pointment of a new faculty member to 
work through both the Forestry School 
and American Studies to teach two in-
troductory environmental studies 
courses. Such an instructor would also 
coordinate existing offerings into a 
more cohesive presentation. 


Although a usefuJ idea, these recom-
mendations constitute only a first step 
in bringing environmental education 
to Yale. None of the world's multiply-
ing resource problems can be ad-
dressed if leading universities do not 
provide adequate environmental 
studies programs. 


Yale should offer more than just two 
introductory courses; it should bring 
environmental questions 
into the 
mainstream of academic life. The cur-
ricuJum needs many new courses, 
coordination of existing ones, and an 
enÂ·. ironmental studies major. Not un-
til Yale effects these changes can its 
students become environmentally 
literate.
