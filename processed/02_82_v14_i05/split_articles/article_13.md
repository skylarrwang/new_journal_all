Yale~ Centrex operators are some of the many clerical workers the union wants to organize. 
in which the people went out on the 
street," Wilhelm said. 


"They make more than anyone else 
in the area for their kind of work," 
Wilhelm added, "and that's one of the 
principal reasons why our members 
were willing to settle for a relatively 
modest economic package." 

As a result of the "modest" wage set-
tlement, the University saved a lot of 
money. Donald Stevens points out that 
the new contract contains a smaller 
percentage increase in overall costs to 
the University than e-ither the settle-
ment in 1977 after a 13-week strike or 
the one in 1974 after a 
10-week 
walkout. These figures indicate that 
the combined cost of the new benefits 
and the wage increase is less than the 
cost of the wage concessions made by 
the University in the past. 

"We shouldn't pay any group at Yale 
more or less than competitive wages, 
and that meant a little less for the 
bargaining unit and a little Jess over a 
three year period 
is 
a 
powerful 
number," according to Jerald Stevens, 
Vice-President of Finance and Ad-
ministration. 

Furthermore, Donald Stevens noted 
that the final settlement on wages is 
virtually identical to the University's 
first offer made last December. In the 
final proposal, the upper salary grades 
got a 30 cents an hour raise, up only 
five 
cents 
from 
the 
University's 
original proposal. The lower salary 
grades got a five cents an hour raise, 
the same figure that the University had 
proposed in early December. 

Moreover, the Union agreed to 
make the salary for people entering the 
workforce one dollar less for their first 
six months, and 50 cents Jess for their 
second six months. Wilhelm points out 
that this change will affect no one 
already 
in the bargaining unit, 
although it will be felt by people who 
are just starting to work for Yale 
including student dining hall workers: 
But at least one local labor leader 
feels that the substantial concessions 
the Union gave on wages are not offset 
by the benefits they got in return. He 
points out that job security means very 
little if the University is about to hire 
more workers as the Administration 
has hinted it will do. He also claims 
that the commitments to consult with 
the Union do not mean much because 
the Union has no recourse if there is 
disagreement between the two parties. 
•rd be embarassed to take that back 
to my bargaining unit," he com-
mented. 

"It's not like Yale is General Motors 
and you've got to save the institution" 
by accepting low wages, he added. "I 
think they (the Union] got clobbered" 
at the bargaining table. 


No matter who got the better end of 
the Agreement, both sides won a 
substantial victory by signing the first 
three year contract at Yale since 1965 
without a 
strike. Even with 
economic and working condition im-
provements that Local 35 brought 
about in the 1970s, the strikes were not 
easy on the workforce, especially the 
long ones that lasted 10 and 13 weeks. 

Likewise, the Administration is happy 
to have done away with much of the 
hostility that the strikes caused in the 
work place and the greater New Haven 
community. 

"No one knows what it's like to settle 
around here," Wilhelm commented 
just after the vote. 

How clo•• to • etrlke? 
The Union's and the University's vital 
interests were not in direct conflict this 
time around. They both seemed wil-
ling to settle for low wages and more 
benefits. But Union officials say there 
would have been a strike if the U niver-
sity had not given in on some of its 
more controversial demands, 
par-
ticularly the attempts to "take back" 
proposals from the old contract. 

"There is a school of thought which 
is popular in management these days 
that rather than going to the bargain-
ing table and in effect proposing the 
status quo and arguing about how 
much forward you ought to go, that 
the management ought to come to the 
bargaining table and talk about going 
backwards," Wilhelm said. 

Stevens maintains that the Universi-
ty's proposals were made to help 
management operate more efficiently. 

"We were proposing things that would 
help the University operate," he said . 
"I don't know if they were for bargain-
ing purposes." 

The University wanted to limit the 
number of times a worker could bid to 
switch departments in a year, make 
Good Friday into a floating holiday, 
and put a 40 cent cap on the COLA. 
But the most important "take back" 
was an attempted revision of Section 
2.9 covering job descriptions and job 
titles. Under the old contract, the 
University had to notify the Union of 
any job reclassification 10 days before 
it takes effect, thereby allowing the 
Union time to challenge their decision 
through the grievance procedure. The 
University sought to rewrite that 
statute so that it could reclassify at 
will without having to notify the Union 
in advance, according to Sam Issacha-
rofT, a second year Law School student 
and 
member of Local 
35's 
negotiating committee. 

"That change would have effectively 
put the Unions out of business," 
IssacharofT said, because, like the 
disputed job security 
policy, 
University could use the classification 
to manipulate the work force by 
switching their jobs around. 

IssacharofT maintains that, had the 
University not dropped the proposed 
change on the last day of negotiations, 
there would have been a strike. 

Wilhelm agreed. "If they'd insisted 
on those take backs, there would be a 
strike," he reportedly told the workers 
just before they voted on the new con-
tract. He said the University withdrew 
those proposals over the weekend of 
the vote, except for the reduction m 
starting salary which he described as 
"acceptable." 

Wilhelm also maintains that the 
"take backs" strategy backfired on the 
University. "If the University proposed 
(the 'take backs'] as a way of getting 
people to settle for less, I think they 
had the opposite effect," he said. "They 
pissed people ofT." 

Local 35 captialized on the "take 
backs," using them against the U niver-
sity. The Union negotiating team met 
regularly with "captains" elected from 
each department at Yale to report on 
the progress being made at the table. 
The news of the "take backs" spreading 
through the work force as a result of 
those meetings gave rise to much of the 
pessimism and anxiety felt by many 
members of the community as the 
deadline approached. 

Local 35 also had another ploy to 
bargain from a more powerful posi-
tion. They circulated a flyer entitled A 
Chalkngt to Yale University the same 
week that negotiations began. "We 
want Yale to let us increase our pro-
ductivity," it read, blaming "wasteful 
bureaucratic management" and "lack 
of consistency and effective planning," 
for the "productivity problem." 

By casting the University as the 
primary impediment to more efficient 
production, the Union used the same 
claim against the University that might 
have been leveled against itself. Many 
people felt that the University was go-
ing to hold that the members of Local 
35 were •Jazy" and "overpaid," as 
justificaton for the low salary increases 
they sought from the first day of 
negotiations. But Local 35 tried to 
deflate that charge with the productivi-
ty flyer. 

"That was a good ploy by John," a 
high ranking University official said. 
"The University certainly has an in-
terest in improving productivity, and 
he tried to capture the University's 
ground." 

Wilhelm also made many remarks to 
the press throughout the negotiations 
to the effect that the University's un-
willingness to cooperate with Local 35 
was hurting the negotiations. 

"There is a total lack of interest in


"Quite frankly, I'm somewhat 
surprls$d we're not out on 
the streets." 

doing something useful like [improv-
ing productivity) by the administra-
tion," he told the Yale Daily News four 
days before the contract would expire. 
'They want to continue to ignore prob-
lems like these," he added. 

"That was never said at the bargain-
ing table," Stevens maintained, adding 
that the Union and the University 
came to a conceptual agreement on 
"productivity" early on, but disagreed 
primarily on how much of a wage in-
crease the workers should get. 

"Wilhelm, as any union person will 
do, will seek out the news sources and 
give them statements because he's try-
ing to keep his constituency involved," 
Stevens said. "I don't have that prob-
lem." 

troublemakers in the negotiations, 
Wilhelm could either score points 
among the members of Local 35 · for 
winning concessions for them, or 
blame a strike on the University's un-
willingness to cooperate, if need be. 

But Local 35 was not able to get 
every improvement they sought even 
with these tactics. Wilhelm reportedly 
outlined to the workers before the vote 
some of the proposals that he would 
like to have gotten from the Universi-
ty, such as medical coverage for dental 
care and eyeglasses, improvements in 
the pension plan, free parking, and 
reform of the job classifications. 

"We'll never have any improvements 
in these areas until we have a clerical 
and technical union," he reportedly 
told the members of Local 35. 

White collar drive 
Wilhelm maintains that while Local 35 
had made significant improvements in 
working conditions at Yale, they have 
done so with rather limited resources. 
With over 9,000 employees at Yale, the 
1,373 employees in Local 35's bargain-
ing unit make up a small portion of the 
workforce. 

As Wilhelm explained in an inter-
view last summer: "In sheer power 
terms, we don't have the ability to crip-
ple the University. Our strikes harass 
the University, 
inconvenience the 
University, embarass the University, 
but just in terms of raw power, the fact 
is that we can't control the University 
by ourselves. That is always a fact 
which overshadows everything that 
goes on at the bargaining table. We 
know it and they know it. On the other..., 
hand if the clerical and technical and 
the service and maintenance people all 
stood together, 
that's another 
ballgame." 

Since November of 1980, Local 35 
has led a drive to organize the clerical 
and technical workers into a sister 
union called Local 34. If it is suc-
cessful, the two unions would have a 
great deal of power at the bargaining 
table especially if they chose to honor 
each others' picket lines. While they 
could use that strength to negotiate 
better settlements for the work force, 
the changes would no doubt raise the 
operating costs of the University, 
leading possibly to higher tuition or 
curtailed services. 

Recently, Local 35 has overcome 
many of the obstacles which kept the 
Union from calling for a vote on 
union representation by the white col-
lar workers. On January 21, just five 
days after the union ended its two 
months of negotiations with the 
University, the United Auto Workers 
(UA W) suddenly ended its three and a 
half year old drive to organize the 
clericals and technicals. Their 
withdrawal ended the confusion tha~ 
many workers had because two unions 
were competing for the nght to repre-
