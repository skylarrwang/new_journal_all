EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Winks accurately presents detective 
fiction as a genre "that compels atten-
tion to every word," and uses this state-
ment in the best defense I have read of 
Agatha Christie's tour-de-force, The 
Murder of Roger Ackroyd. Winks returns 
the reader to the critical point in the 
text to demonstrate that Christie was 
definitely 'playing fair' in her resolu-
tion of the mystery. 


For the most part, Winks does not 
deal with classic detection and the 
master investigators. He is more in-
terested in contemporary detective fic-
tion, in which the emphasis has 
markedly shifted from presenting and 
resolving an intricate puzzle to depic-
tion of human nature within the 
framework of the investigation of a 
crime. Anyone who has, like myself, 
dismissed spy fiction without fair trial, 
will likely be inclined to alter his judge-
ment after reading Winks. He says spy 
fiction is founded upon the seeming 
"trivia of detail; "The unobserved detail 
is the important detail." The spy moves 
alone, opposed by the enemy and his 
natural allies. Landscape is crucial to a 
good spy novel as "spy fiction is 
cinematic, visual, the sense of place 
providing a good measure of the sense 
of menace." Winks sensibly takes to 
task those indolent thriller-writers who 
fail to accurately research the era or 
locale they depict. The accent on am-
biguity and uncertainty in contem-
porary society is picked up by Winks: 
"The modern spy thriller is not chess, 
coldly rational, with values attached to 
each participant, for we do not know 
the values." The 
new game 
is 
backgammon, where the roll of the 
dice is neutral and "the testing is in the 
way one plays the roll." 


For Winks, detective fiction pro-
vides insights into much more than the 
operation of a criminal investigation. 
He would place Dorothy Sayers' Lord 
Peter Wimsey mystery Gaudy Night 
"on the shelf of women's liberationist 
literature." Sayers becomes not a 
mystery writer, but "a highly skilled 
novelist of manners in an academic set-
~ng" who chooses the '"device of the 
mystery because she enjoys it." Winks 
actually refers to contemporary 
mystery writer Amanda Cross in the 
above quotation but it is clear he 
means to include the earlier author in 
the category of a skilled novelist using 
the mystery to present "one of the 
angriest, most chilling denunciations 
of a university utterly dominated by 
men." 


Winks 1s 
occasionally 
~ilty of 
deviating from his stated mtention. 
Gaudy Night may provide him with an 
opening into women's liberation (as 
elsewhere 
The 
Ox-Bow 
Incident 
presented a young Winks with his first 
exposure to injustice), but to classify it 
as a novel of liberation masquerading 
as a mystery rather than a mystery 
novel that by virtue of its setting must 
perforce deal with the position of 
female academics is, to me, a mistake. 


In one other place, Winks makes too 
broad a claim "about education and 
family and perhaps America" based on 
his own realization that he did not have 
to like "great" art simply because it had 
been labeled "great" by others. 


Winks narrowly treads the line be-
tween seriousness and mock-seri-
ousness, but the constant presence of 
wit and good humor make Modus 
Operandi a pleasant diversion and keeps 
those assertions most open to challenge 
nicely cushioned.
