The Ex~cutiv~ Commit~e of tlu Yale Political Union 
appears to remain an organization 
with a lot to offer politically interested 
Yale students. The purpose of the 
Union according to its Constitution 
and its officers is to provide an open 
â€¢ forum for political dialogue from all 
parts of the political spectrum, and it 
appears to be providing that service. 


What, then, 
is wrong with the 
Union? Many suggest it is simply the 
victim of increased student political 
apathy and a new professionalism in 
students' goals. If this is so, perhaps the 
concept of a mass membership Political 
Union is anachronistic.
