**Title: Heinrich von Staden Interviews Athol Fugard**
**Author: Heinrich von Staden**
**Page number(s): 14-15**

Outspoken South African playwright Athol Fugard has had several of his plays produced at the Yale Repertory Theatre. His most recent play- Master Harold and the Boys - premieres at the Rep March 12. It deals with an episode in the lives of two black men (Willie and Sam) and a 17 year-old white boy (Hally, later called Master Harold). 

A part-Afrikaner who writes in English and lives in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, Fugard has written, directed, and acted in over a dozen plays, both in South Africa and abroad. He is best known in this country for his plays A Lesson from Aloes (produced at the Yale Repertory Theatre with James Earl Jones and Mario Tucci under Fugard's direction), Boesman and Lena, Sizwe Bansi Is Dead, The Blood, and The Island. In 1979, he also published a novel, Tsotsi, which was written more than twenty years earlier. 

All of Fugard's works are set in South Africa and deal with politically explosive material in a humane, sensitive way. They dramatize how difficult it is for people's decency to survive the brutalizing effects of racial oppression; but his plays also insist that it is possible- indeed imperative- for individual decency to survive the moral imperfections of the state and of the body politic. 

Heinrich von Staden, a friend of Fugard's, is the Master of Ezra Stiles College and Associate Professor of Classics and Comparative Literature at Yale. Born in Pretoria, South Africa, von Staden grew up mainly among Afrikaners and urban Blacks and attended Afrikaans schools. He voluntarily left South Africa when he was seventeen and has lived in self-imposed exile in Austria, Germany, and the United States ever since. 

Parts of the following interview were conducted in Afrikaans.

Heinrich von Staden: Athol, whenever I see you roaming around freely, I'm relieved. You are walking on the edge of what is permissible in South Africa, with a lot of the themes you are treating. You never fall off that edge. And the authorities don't push you off the edge. Nor do they chain you so that you can't continue walking along the edge. I sometimes wonder, is that because Athol is writing in English?

Athol Fugard: It's because I'm writing in English, and there's another factor. Another important factor, Heinrich. The days when the likes of myself- old style liberals like Alan Payton (the South African author)- were regarded as Public Enemy Number One are past. The polarization within South African society is extreme now. God, I'm not going to make bombs; Alan is never gonna make bombs; but there are people who are making bombs. Ten years ago they thought that Alan and I might get around to making bombs one day. And that's when they were nervous. They didn't realize then that we were actually never into making bombs at all.

HvS: The bombs of fiction-Athol, aren't they more explosive than TNT?

Fugard: I'd like to believe that. You understand I've got to be careful about that one. I've got to be careful about flattering myself about the potency of the one area of activity which I've got, which is theatre and being a writer.

HvS: How often have there been productions of your plays for non-segregated audiences in South Africa?

Fugard: I've had to change my tactics in terms of that over the years. At a period when the policy on segregated audiences in South Africa was rigid and very strictly enforced, I had to make a decision whether to take on an act of silence, just be silent because I couldn't go into a theatre that was decent in my terms, or whether to take on the compromising circumstances of segregated audiences simply because I felt that if a play has got something to say, at least say it. And there were years when I decided to do the latter. I did perform before segregated audiences. In a sense I regret that decision now. I think I might possibly have looked after myself- and maybe the situation- better by not accepting that compromise. But I did.

HvS: But do you think you had a genuine choice at that time?

Fugard: I had a choice between silence or being heard.

HvS: Let me ask you, along similar lines, when you are writing a play or a novel like Tsotsi, do you sense constraints on the way you are writing in view of the fact that certain things are anathema to the government, also in fiction?

Fugard: I would like to believe that I have operated at the table at which I sit and write, that I have operated totally without self-censorship. Maybe some awareness of what is possible and is not possible has operated subconsciously and is deciding choices I make in terms of what I favor. I think it may be pertinent to the conversation we are having, that Master Harold and the Boys is the first play of mine in 24 years of writing that will have its premiere outside of South Africa. And one of the reasons why I'm doing that this time is that there are elements in Master Harold and the Boys that might have run into censorship problems.

HvS: I appreciate exactly what you're saying; there was a point in the text where indeed I asked myself, "how could this be performed in South Africa?"

Fugard: Well, that's why I'm here in New Haven.

HvS: Has your relationship with Yale been confined to the Yale Rep, or has it included the Southern African Research Program and the University in general?

Fugard: Yes. The Southern African Research Program-that's joint Yale and Wesleyan- got me over here on a fellowship. I must say I did find the academic aspect of Yale a bit heavy going.

HvS: Athol, let's make no bones about it, you're not an academic.

Fugard: No. Certainly not.

HvS: You don't have a university degree.

Fugard: No, and the language academics use sometimes make me wonder whether I, in fact, speak English or not.

HvS: Let me ask you this, because I think it leads to an important question for those of us who are in universities. Here you are, a person who, critics say, has achieved exceptional insight into human nature, and you never obtained a university degree. What institutions, what processes do you think contributed most to the insights you have?

Fugard: Well, I think to be a South African is in a way to be at a university that teaches you about that. The South African experience is certainly on ...
