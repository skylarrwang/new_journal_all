**Toad's' defensive line**
**Author: Matt Hamel**
**Page number(s): 26-27**

Toad's Place opens at 8. 
"Hi, how ya doin'?" asks Whiskey of 
the few 
fans who had been waiting 
outside. Cold, they tell him. He asks 
for their identification, collects their 
money, stamps their hands with one of 
24 rubber stamps and sets his 6'4 ~ ", 
300 pound frame on a barstool. 
"The type of crowd depends on the 
type of band," he says. "There's no 
such thing as an average crowd." Eight 
to the Bar, a 1940s revival band, is 
tonight's show, and it usually attracts 
women in their twenties. "They like to 
dance," he explains. 

If you have been at Toad's Place, 
chances are good that Whiskey has 
asked for your ID, collected your 
money, stamped your hand. He works 
five nights a week at the nightclub on 
York Street, and at least a couple of 
those are spent at the door. He is a 
floorman , not a bouncer, as his boss, 
Brian Phelps, is quick to explain. "I 
would never hire a bouncer," Phelps 
says. "My floorrnen are responsible for 
much more 
than just bouncing 
drunks." 

"I equate my joo with that of a white 
blood cell," soft-spoken Whiskey says. 
"fm here to keep Toad's Place safe and 
clean. Our theory is to have enough 
force to prevent an incident. If you had 
four people my size around you, it 
would be silly to do anything." The 12 
page training manual that floormen 
are tested on explains the Toad's 
system: the floor is divided into three 
zones. One floorman is responsible for 
the area to the right of the stage, one 
for the center, and a third for the left of 
the stage and downstairs. A fourth sits 
in the box in the middle of the floor 
and oversees 
the others. Vinnie 
Volmut is working in the box tonight. 
He sits behind the sound man, in front 
of the light man, and surveys the floor. 
"I have to keep an overview of 
everything that's going on," he says. 
"I'm like the quarterback. You have to 
train your eyes to look for a million lit-
tle things. It's a lot more than just 
fights. In fact, there are very rarely 
any fights." When a paper airplane 
lands innocuously on the stage, for ex-
ample, Vinnie searches the crowd for 
the culprit. The next time it happens, 
Vinnie spots him and trains a small 
white flashlight on him. Another floor-
man makes his way through the crowd, 
an art in itself, and escorts the villain to 
the door. 

"The system is great," says Whiskey. 
"It works much better than whistles 
. would, and the people don't notice it. 
They think the flashlight is just another 
light shining. We're able to get to a 
trouble spot and move the trouble out 
the door within 30 seconds. And a 
good doorman can keep trouble out 
before it gets in. 90 to 95 per cent of 
troublemakers don't get in." Since a 
dress code was instituted banning 
leather, Whiskey says, the motorcycle 
gangs that used to frequent Toad's 
never show up. "You know it's been a 
good night if you don't do anything." 

Even if they don't do anything, they 
are busy. Vinnie lists some of his 
responsibilities: "We have to clean up 
the bathroom, where you don't know 
what you're picking up. We have to 
deal with people who faint [there were 
two in 1981] or vomit, or play with the 
thermostat, or the air-conditioner, or 
the sinks. There have been stink 
bombs in the men's room. There was 
an M-80 in there once. People take 
drugs in there. People lie to your face, 
tell you they didn't do something you 
saw them do. People complain about 
losing a 
quarter in 
the 
pinball "' 
machine." 

Whiskey, as the senior floorman , is


The jloomu:n at Toad's await the night's crowds 
in charge of designating who patrols 
what zone. "We have 12 floormen, and 
seven come in on a busy night. The 
manager sets the guidelines for securi-
ty and I figure out how to do it." 

Whlakey'a .Journey 
Whiskey came to Toad's by way of the 
1960s. "I was a freshman at Yale in 
1966." He lived in Durfee, then af-
ftliated with T.D. "Things were dif-
ferent then. We wore coats and ties at 
every meal. There were no women. I 
joined the Young Democrats, drank 
red and green cups at Mory's, played 
freshmen football under Harry J acun-
ski, joined the judo team, the whole 
bit. Then the world started changing." 

Whiskey took two years off after 
freshman year. He joined what he calls 
"a counter-cultural commune" in 
Philadelphia, then returned to Yale to 
take drama courses. "I wasn't crazy 
enough. You have to really live, die 
and breathe everything." He drifted into 
the American Studies department, got 
married, moved off-campus. He took 
some more time ofT to run a center for 
emotionally disturbed kids. 

"Then I burned out. I went to 
California-everyone has to. I lasted 
in L.A. for two hours, then went to 
San Francisco. I decided that Califor-
nia was one _giant Boston Post Road, so 
I came back east." 

He got divorced, joined a co-op 
garage (he's still a part-time mechanic 
by day), and decided that he wanted a 
job with absolutely no hassles. "I 
became a parking lot attendant at the 
Yale-New Haven Hospital. It was a 
wonderful job; I became the super-
visor." He organized the attendants in-
to a union and led a seven-week strike 
for better pay and working conditions. 
"The strike resulted in a better con-
tract, but needless to say, I was, er, 
terminated." 

That's when Bill Walkauskas went to 
Toad's Place. "I thought it would be 
kind of fun, kind of like Matt Dillon 
after 15 years in Dodge City." He's 
been a fixture at Toad's since just a few 
months after it opened. "Hungry 
Charlie's was a restaurant here. When 
it moved out, Toad's moved in." 

Michael Spoerndle, the 30-year old 
owner of Toad's, is a graduate of the 
Culinary Institute of America, and the 
bar at Toad's was originally more im-
portant than the entertainment. Even-
tually, bigger bands and record com-
panies began to notice Toad's, and it 
grew into more of a nightclub. Promo-
tional parties are held there by record 
companies, such as a recent "listening 
party" given by CBS Records for Molly 
Hatchet's new album. The room was 
expanded in stages to twice its original 
size, allowing still bigger acts to tune 
up for New York or Boston gigs on the 
more manageable New Haven stage. 
Bruce Springsteen and Bob Seger jam-
med there after concerts at the New 
Jeff Strong/The New Jo .. rnal 
Haven Coliseum in 1979 (within a 
week of each other). Blondie and 
Meatloaf have also performed there. 

"Billy Joel was our biggest deal so 
far," Whiskey says. "We had 
13 
floormen, plus Joel's personal security 
guard. There were plenty of ofT-duty 
cops here, too." Normally meant to 
hold between 600 and 700 people, 
Toad's fit 1000 Joel fans that June 
night in 1980. A cut from his new live 
album was recorded there. 

"I remember that show, but I don't 
remember too many others," Whiskey 
says. "They all fade together. Five a 
week, 20 a month, four and a half 
years . . . They pay me to watch the 
crowds, not the shows. A band has to 
be really good to get my attention." 

Vinnie agrees: "When there's a band I 
want to see, I take the night off." 

Yale students started going to Toad's 
about three and a half years ago, when 
there were occasional Morse and Stiles 
nights. It grew from there. "Sometimes 
there are 20 per cent Yalies here, more 
on Yale nights," Whiskey says. 

While Whiskey talks, the crowd 
grows. He asks for identification, col-
lects money, stamps hands. When the 
small entryway gets crowded, he raises 
himself to his full stature, his green and 
yellow Toad's Place jacket buttoned 
against the winter that slips through 
the door. He keeps things moving 
peacefully by the mere authority of his
