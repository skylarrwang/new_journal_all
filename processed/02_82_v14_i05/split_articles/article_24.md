Hopes 
and concerns 
over cheap 
Isotopes 
Tim Misner 
Yale 
researchers 
Mahadevan 
Krishnan, J. L. 
Hirshfield and 
Michael Geva have recently made a 
breakthrough' which could lead to an 
inexpensive supply of isotopes. 
Ironically, although this technique has 
many beneficial applications in 
medicine and physics, it could produce 
the raw material for nuclear weapons. 
Radioactive isotopes of Thalium are 
used 
in a 
promising method of 
diagnosing heart conditions. Doctors 
can take pictures of the patient's heart 
with a special camera by injecting 
Thalium into the bloodstream. Many 
heart attack victims could be helped by 
this technique, but the high cost of pro-
ducing the Thalium has barred its 
widespread availability. 


An inexpensive supply of isotopes 
would also be a boon to nuclear 
physicists. 
Accelerator or "atom 
smasher" experiments, which help to 
uncover the basic particles and forces 
of nature, can easily consume upwards 
of $50,000 worth of isotopes per day. 
Because of the high cost, many ex-
periments of considerable scientific in-
terest are not conducted. 


But for some in the scientific world, 
separating isotopes means enriching 
uranium for use in nuclear weapons. 
"There was great excitement when the 
paper carne out. Some people worried 
about whether it should be classified or 
not," said Werner Wolf, Chairman of 
Engineering and Applied Sciences. In 
fact, the researchers themselves were 
worried that the Pentagon, which 
keeps a close watch on the papers 
published in scientific journals, would 
classify their 
work. 
Said Wolf, 
"Krishnan himself came and showed 
me something [his results). He worried 
that we might have trouble publishing, 
that someone might want to classify it." 
Said Krishnan, "Anyone who does 
anything in isotope separation has to 
deal with the specter of this nuclear 
business." 


Could 
their 
plasma centrifuge 
technique be developed to produce the 
raw material for nuclear weapons? "In 
principle we don't see why not," said 
Geva. But he was quick to point out 
that there were practical difficulties in 
using their technique for uranium. 
"For uranium it fthe experimental ap-
paratus] could not work because our 
magnetic field is too weak." 


Robert Wheeler, Chairman of Ap-
plied Physics, is doubtful that this 
technique will ever be used 
for 
uranium enrichment. "It takes an 
enormous amount of capital to develop 
a new technology," and this technology 
is still in the theoretical stages of 
development. 


The Department of 
Defense, which has already invested 
large sums in other approaches to 
uranium enrichment, is not looking for 
new ideas. 


Jack Warner, Director of Grants 
and Contracts, commented, "If some-
one gets into an area to enhance 
isotope separation, in a marketable, 
productive way, then it is very possible 
that DOD or the Department of 
Energy will say 'that's classified.' I 
recall some years ago- in isotope 
separation- they [DOD) said that the 
work the guy was doing was classified, 
~ 
and so he was obliged to put the books 
into a safety box." The researcher 
whose work was classified left Yale 
shortly after this happened. "You're 
jeopardizing a man's academic career 
if his work can't be subject to the 
scrutiny of his peers." 


In the case of Krishnan. Hirschfield 
and Geva, the work was published. It 
addresses the problem of pulling the 
heavier isotopes apart from the lighter 
ones. It has long been known that in a 
centrifuge the heavier isotopes move 
further to the outside. But since the in-
ternal structure of solids is not changed 
by centrifugal force, the researchers 
had to find some way of converting the 
metal to a fluid. The breakthrough 
came when they discovered an effective 
way of converting metal to plasma. 
Plasma is charged gas, like the air sur-
rounding a lightning bolt. Their major 
innovation was to use a laser to 
transform the metal. A laser beam is 
fired at a sample of metal, burning it 
ofT and changing it to a gas. Spun by 
electrical and magnetic forces the 
plasma spirals down towards the end of 
the tube, and the metal collects there,~ 
with the heaviest isotopes furthest from 
the center. 


Traditional methods of separating 


isotopes are costly 
and time-
consuming. At Oakridge National 
Laboratories, the major world supplier 
of isotopes, beams of ions form an in-
visible strainer that only allows a 
specific isotope to pass through. The 
Yale researchers' machine can handle 
1000 times as many isotopes at a time, 
though at present it cannot work as 
continously as the Oakridge machine. 


The 
Oakridge 
machine 
produces 
isotopes of 99 per cent purity, as com-
pared to 90 per cent for the Yale 
machine, but for most applications, 
high purity is not required. 


Krishnan stressed that much work 
remains to be done. "The difference is 
similar to that between Scbockley's first 
transistor and the integrated circuits in 
your pocket calculator," he said. From 
the initial investigations to production, 
a full-fledged research project would 
take three to six years. But despite all 
that remains to be done, the research-
ers have faith in the future of their 
technique. 


As for future research, Krishnan 
and Hirshfield hope to find a more 
Qlegant theoretical model for how the 
plasma behaves. "The theory we have 
now is rudimentary at best," said 
Krishnan. One outstanding question is 
why a partially ionized gas cannot be 
made to spin faster than a certain limit. 
Also, the researchers would like to ex-
periment with other ways to separate 
isotopes, as well as fine-tuning their 
present method. The research has been 
slowed by the tedious process of 
monitoring the isotopes' separation. 


Krishnan and Hirshfield, who both 
initiated the project five to six years 
ago, continue to work together. Geva, 
on the other hand, will probably finish 
writing his Ph.D. thesis on the plasma 
centrifuge results and leave 
the 
academic world for an industrial lab, 
where in all likelihood he will be earn-
ing 50-75 per cent more than his Ph.D. 
advisers. 


Researchers Krishnan, Geva and 
Hirshfield perceive a tension between 
the desire to do scientific work and the 
moral problems with some of its ap-
plications. Though this holds true for 
almost all the sciences, the uses of an 
applied scientist's work are more ap-
parent. Noted Krishnan, "You realize 
that isotopes can be used to make 
bombs or they can help to diagnose 
heart disease."
