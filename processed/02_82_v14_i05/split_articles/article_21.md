size. "I'm sorry, I can't accept this ID," 
he tells a kid with peach fuzz on his up-
per lip. His impassive, bearded face 
and thick-framed glasses create a 
psychological distance between him 
and the eager crowd, and Peach Fuzz 
doesn't even protest what is clearly the 
last word on the subject. 

When there are not as many people 
trying to get in, the entryway fills with 
Whiskey's friends: off-duty floormen, 
an ofT-duty cop (Toad's hires one every 
night, just in case), a pizza chef from 
Yorkside, the sound man, Toad's Place 
groupies who show up every night. 
"I miss when Toad's was crazier," 
Whiskey says. "It's mellower now. 
There's not even a fight on St. Patrick's 
Day. When we started it was more of a 
party. Now it's more of a business. 
That's the only way to expand, I sup-
pose, but the old days were fun, too. 
Remember the free popcorn all over 
the floor?" 

Floorman Bob Szponda, 10 year 
veteran of local bars, spews forth a 
library of anecdotes from the good old 
days. The 6'2" 250 pounder is a credit 
collector by day, but he clearly revels 
in his nighttime antics. His rapid-fire 
delivery and verbal shortcuts make 
him hard to follow, but now and then a 
decipherable phrase gives the neophyte 
listener a clue to the story's gist. "Then 
I grabbed two or three of the little guys 
and carried them outside," he says. "I'd 
quit before I'd kick out a woman who's 
pissing on the floor," he says. The con-
tent of the anecdotes is immaterial; if 
you wanted to film them, you would 
have to make a psychedelic, noisy se-
quence of blurred motion. 

The job is not as violent as its 
stereotype. "I've only thrown four pun-
ches in four years here," says Whiskey, 
"and I've had maybe twice that, maybe, 
thrown at me. The worst thing that 
Whiskry, jloorman at Toad's 
ever happened to me was when a guy 
saw 
his 
ex-wife 
here 
with her 
boyfriend. He went wild. We got him 
outside and I was holding him when he 
bit my arm. I had to have tetanus shots 
for that." Vinnie says he has never 
thrown or taken a punch in just over a 
year at Toad's. 

Just as there is no average crowd, 
there is no average floorman. Rohn 
Lawrence, 6'3" and 250 pounds, plays 
jazz at the Foundry Cafe on his nights 
ofT, as well as on some locally recorded 
albums. A nother floorman was once a 
Philadephia Eagle. They average 260 
pounds, and you would have to be 
pretty drunk to pick a fight with any of 
them. 

What they share, besides size, is 
Toad's Place. "Night people become 
your people," Whiskey says. "It's a 
whole after hours world. It makes 
sense to go to someone's house at 3 
a.m. When I go out in the daytime it's 
way too crowded. The cars are too 
close together." Whiskey generally 
stays up until sunrise. "They pay me to 
be paranoid here," he explains. "I've 
got to spend a few hours unwinding 
when I go home." He plays video 
games or his guitar to loosen up. He 
rises between noon and one ("I've never 
had much use for mornings"), works 
on his flower garden, sometimes strolls
Jeff Strong/The New Journel 
through the 11 acres of woods he lives 
on in Woodbridge. He reads, mostly 
modern English history, fixes himself Â· 
dinner, then goes to work. 

Whiskey is uncertain about his 
future. Toad's is expanding; a Water-
bury Toad's Place opened recently and 
more are scheduled. "Having a chain 
of Toad's Place was a gleam in the 
owner's eye when this was a sawhorse," 
Whiskey says, slamming his hand 
against the entryway wall. "I like hang-
ing around with music people and with 
the kids who come here. I like the fact 
that this is a safe place for them to 
learn how to drink." As for a bar of his 
own, "that's a lot of time and money 
down the road." 

VInnie In the box
"It's bizarre that I'm working here," 
says Vinnie, a 6'9", 275 pound blond. 
I'm more comfortable in a three-piece 
suit. I don't smoke. I don't like the loud 
noise; it affects your central nervous 
system. I love rock & roll, but I never 
hung out in bars. This is a bad en-
vironment for me." 

Vinnie is Toad's Place's video pro-
duction manager, and works as a floor-
man on a part-time basis. Trained at 
Hofstra University on Long Island, he. 
has worked in video for several years. 
He produced industrial training and
