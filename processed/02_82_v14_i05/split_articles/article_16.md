which, if you're prepared to keep your 
eyes open and look, you're going to see 
a lot of suffering. But then, in terms of 
personal specifics, I suppose for me 
there was a very, very important rela-
tionship, a friendship, with a black 
man in what I suppose is any person's 
most formative and definitive years, 
the age between 11, 10 up until the age 
of 20. It was a black man in Port 
Elizabeth, and my play Master Harold 
and the Boys reflects something of that 
friendship, tries to talk about it, look at 
it. I left South Africa, hitchhiked 
through the African continent, ended 
up as a sailor on a ship which, apart 
from the officers and engineers, had a 
totally non-white, had a totally black 
crew, and I was a sailor in a totally 
black crew. There was that. I think I 
can't nail down any one specific 
traumatic incident as being totally 
decisive. But I could be certain that 
Master Harold and the Boys deals with 
one specific moment which I'm trying 
to exorcise out of my soul. 
HvS: In all of your plays and in the 
novel you always have a South African 
setting. Yet your plays and your 
novels, 
though so rooted in the 
specifics of the South African situation, 
seem to have a tremendous appeal to 
audiences that are largely ignorant of 
the situation there. To what do you 
ascribe that? 
Fugard: You take a chance. As a 
storyteller one year ago, I took a 
·• 
chance . . . I realized that it was final-
ly time to deal with the story of a 17

year-old boy and his friendship with 
two black men. And it's a gamble. 
There's no formula. There is no way 
that you can make or decide or 
guarantee before the event that that 
story is going to resonate outside of its 
specific context. You just take a bloody 
chance. 
HvS: Let's go back again to South 
Africa from a slightly different angle. 
After you've been in a country like 
America or England, where you can 
speak and move freely, without the 
kinds of constraints that are only too 
well known to exist in South Africa, 
why do you go back to South Africa so 
insistently? Every time you've been 
abroad, you've insisted on going back 
again. 
Fugard: My answer to the question is 
quite simply that the little or the lot I 
know about loving, which is, I think, 
the most important activity in life, was 
taught me by South Africa. I must ad-
mit that the moment I find myself out-
side of my country I can cut through 
very cleanly to why I love it, why I will 
eventually want to go back to it, and 
why I will be buried there. I've chosen 
my spot. 
HvS: You've chosen your spot? 
Fugard: There's a Iitle village in the 
mountains behind GraafT-Reinet. 
HvS: But why would a man who is as 
alive as you are, think so much about 
death . . . as to go and choose . . . ? 
Fugard: Because it's going to happen. 
HvS: Do you think about it very 
often? 
Fugard: There's a 
marvelous few 
sentences in the preface to Kazant-
zakis' RqJorl to Greco, where in the 
course of it he says: "Listen, I'm 
writing this goddamn thing"- he's 
talking to his wife; he says, "I'm writing 
this thing so that what you finally put 
into the ground: just bones, just bones. 
There must be nothing left." At a cer-
tain point as a writer your writing pro-
cess involves a progressive unburden-
ing. You're not accumulating any-
more. You're unburdening yourself. 
Master Harold, relieved me-left me 
feeling a little bit lighter. 
HvS: This country where you will be 
buried, 60 miles from where you were 
born, near Graaff-Reinet, is a country 
which many people think does not 
have much of a future. I was very 
struck in this context by a scene from 
your new play where the notion of pro-
gress 
is introduced, 
because that's 
something that Afrikaners are harping 
on all the time: "We're making pro-
gress, we're making progress." And the 
scene to which I am referring, you will 
recall, from Master Harold, is where 
Hally, before he becomes Master 
Harold, says: "If Joan of Arc was cap-
tured today, she'd . . . 
Fugard: Oh, I love that exchange ... 
I was so happy when that happened. 
HvS: It's beautiful. But your text: "If 
Joan of Arc was captured today, she'd 
be given a fair trial." And then Sam 
says: 
HvS and Fugard (in unison): "And 
then the death sentence." 
HvS: And then Hally says: "I know, I 
know. I oscillate between hope and 
despair." 
Fugard: On the stage it's going to be 
(because my mispronunciation of 
words in my youth, simply because I 
didn't have a good education, waster-
rible) ... it's going to be "I os-killate." 
H vS: Great. Does Athol Fugard also 
os-killate between hope and despair? 
Fugard: Yt>s, yes, yes. My despair is 
always involved in trying to see the 
whole situation, trying to use my im-
agination, in terms of what can happen 
if maybe I get it all sorted out. In that 
context I 
get very confused and 
therefore inclined to despair. What I 
find I cannot lose faith and hope in is 
what Sam says to H ally at the end of 
the play. What Sam's little moment 
amounts to, is saying to this little white 
boy who is going to walk out after a 
series of very traumatic incidents: 
"You can choose the quality of the life 
you're going to live. It's absolutely 
your choice." 
HvS: So your hope arises from your 
faith in individuals? 
Fugard: Yes. 
HvS: And your despair arises from the 
total political picture? 
Fugard: Correct. 
HvS: Do you have some kind of 
systematic or intuitive vision of what 
you think would be a feasible alter-
native to what we now have in South 
Africa? 
Fugard: I can't but believe that any 
decent social system starts with One 
Man, One Vote. I mean, I think that is 
my first and my last political utterance. 
I don't know .. . they talk about 
federalism; 
they 
talk 
about 
something called The President's 
Council now; it's all a load of rubbish. 
HvS: Do you think that the Afrikaner 
would survive, the white man would 
survive? That, of course, 
is 
the 
Afrikaners' standard counter-argu-
ment to a One I\-1an, One Vote system. 




Fugard: Individuals would. Maybe a 
corporate Afrikaans identity would get 
lost, but I don't care about those iden-
tities. 
HvS: As you know, one of the more 
controversial 
topics in American 
univerSities 
whether 
American 
universities should get rid of whatever 
stocks and other holdings they have in 
corporations that do business with 
South Africa. Would you be in favor of 
divesting of holdings in such corpora-
tions, first of all? And secondly, would 
you be in favor of an economic 
boycott? 
Fugard: What's very interesting for 
me is this: Poland is in very serious 
trouble, and the Reagan administra-
tion had no hesitation in moving in 
with some fairly radical sanctions 
against Poland. Yet no American ad-
ministration has 
even 
mooted the 
possibility of similar action against 
South Africa. 
HvS: But there is the decision by cor-
porations 
to 
adopt the 
so-called 
Sullivan principles and their implica-
tions: Equal pay for equal work; in-
tegrated cafeterias; integrated toilets, 
and so on. 
Fugard: That's token. Talk, talk, talk. 
That doesn't change a farthing. 
HvS: So you're in favor of divestment, 
you're in favor of total economic 
pressure, a trade embargo? What 
about the counter-argument that the 
blacks are the ones who would suffer 
most? They'll lose their jobs in Port 
Elizabeth, 
at 
Ford, 
at GM, at 
Firestone. 
Fugard: The black people I've talked 
to, and others whom 
I've heard 
reported, 
have said ... We are 
prepared to go along with that if 
something's really going to happen . 
if something will finally happen. 
HvS: And to drop below the sub-
sistence line? 
Fugard: Ja. 
HvS: Athol, let's get back to your 
plays. One of the things that I find 
striking, both about Piet Bezuidenhout 
in A Lesson from Aloes and about Master 
Harold, is that you leave your audience 
feeling quite ambivalent about your 
protagonist. Let's take Master Harold. 
H ere is a fundamentally good kid who 
went much further than a lot of white .. 
people in South Africa would: in being 
open to blacks, in being willing to 
teach them, to communicate with 
them. Essentially, Hally was not a 
racist until he becomes unveiled as 
Master Harold. And at that point the 
ratio of good to evil becomes very 
unclear, becomes very fuzzy. 
Fugard: Hally [is] 16 or 17 years-old, 
emotionally confused in the way that 
any adolescent would be anywhere in 
the world, but when you also happen 
to be a South African ... You see, 
what is interesting is the way he dic-
tates the nature of the relationship with 
Sam; he forces roles on Sam; he makes 
Sam a servant in one moment: "Just 
get on with your bloody job! No more 
nonsense around here." At another 
moment he'll allow Sam to become his 
intimate, and he will stand in genuine 
adoration of Sam's vision of a worlJ 
without collisions and say: "God, that's 
beautiful Sam, you've got a vision." 
And he can also get around to spitting 
in his face, all of which actually just 
reflects his degree of personal confu-
sion. There is the traumatic experience 
when he leaves the stage at the end of 
the play ... it has been spelt out very 
clearly by Sam that you, and you ahme,
