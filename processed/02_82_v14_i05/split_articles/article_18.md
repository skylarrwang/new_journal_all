Party of the Right members toast at Mory's. 
Bill Buckley was a member. Kingman 
Brewster was a member. At one point 
in the 1960s one quarter of Yale under-
graduates were members. Yet now this 
group has barely 400 undergraduate 
members and is one of the more de-
rided student organizations at Yale. 
Attempts !O deal with the Union's soil-
ed image and sagging membership 
have set off a debate both inside and 
outside of the organization over its 
purpose and operation. 

The Yale Political Union is com-
posed of four internal parties that 
members can join dependent upon 
their ideological leanings. And it is be-
tween these parties- the Liberal Party, 
the Independent Party, the Conser-
vative Party and the Party of the Right 
-that what internal debate there is 
rages. The main question appears to 
be how, if at all, the Union can raise its 
membership up to the levels of ten 
years ago. 

"You can't put too much of the 
blame for the membership figures on 
the Union," said Independent Party 
Chairman Bernie Gilmore. "Basically 
we're not doing anything differently 
now than we were ten years ago. It is 
sort of depressing, though, seeing so 
few members." 

This sense of depression aided by 
the shadow of a once glorious and 
gigantic Political Union appears to be 
the root of much of the unrest and 
uneasiness now present in the PU 
ranks. But it is not the only cause. 

Some signs of actual decay worry

many in the Union. For example, fuUy 
60 per cent of the Union's members are 
either freshmen or sophomores, and as 
Gilmore put it, "In truth, the Union is 
basically dominated by freshmen." 
These are mostly people who joined 
during the summer, before they even 
arrived at Yale and often do not renew 
their membership for a second year. 

Last semester attendance at Union 
student debates was sparse and at 
times almost non-existent. 

In 
December the Progressive Party of the 
Union dissolved for want of members. 
And on top of aU this, the PU has a 
public image of being elitist and 
dominated by people who, as one 
member put it, "are more interested in 
arguing nit-picky political rules than 
being involved in 
a 
meaningful 
political dialogue." 

So in essence the Political Union is 
an organization haunted by a multi-
dimensional image problem. Those 
outside the Union see it as meaningless 
and child-like. Internally, it is haunted 
by the ghost of the Political Union past. 

The origins of much of this situation 
can be found in the Union's changes 
over the past 50 years. Founded in 
1934 as a 
mock parliament, the 
Political Union spent its first 20 years 
of existence 
as solely 
student 
debating society. It was not until the-. 
1950s that the PU invited speakers to 
address it, and then only as key-noters 
for student debates. 

The sudden vast student interest in 
politics of the mid and late 1960s truly

altered the PU. The students who 
came to the Union at that point were 
looking for more than philosophical 
debates that were often more social 
events than anything else. So more 
speakers were invited to key-note 
debates and also just to address the 
Union on topics of political interest. 
New parties formed within the Union 
reflecting the greater ideological 
spread it now represented. By 1970, 
there were five internal parties ranging 
from the activist, radical left Pro-
gressive Party to 
the ultra-
conservative, 
philosophic, debate 
oriented Party of the Right. 

Then in 1972 George McGovern 
was defeated, and soon after the Viet-
nam War ended and the Watergate 
disgrace began. Students' interest in 
politics declined. What activity re-
mained was centered on activist groups 
that had formed during the late '60s. 
The Political Union's membership 
dropped sharply. 

The Liberal Party, which has lost 
more members than any other party 
over the past few years, has made the 
strongest attempt to address 
the 
Union's image problems, identify 
causes and suggest solutions. In an 
editorial in the November issue of the 
party's internal publication The Liberal 
Dialo~, the party leadership identified 
what they saw as some of the causes of 
the Union's poor public image and 
possible ways to solve it. The editorial 
even went as far as to say, "Perhaps the 
time has come for the Liberal Party to 
reconsider its participation in the 
Political Union in its Â·current sorry 
state ... But we'd better hurry- the 
PU is sinking fast." 

"That last bit is too strong, I guess," 
said Gary Hammer, one of the editors 
of the DUz/ogUL and presently Liberal 
Party chairman. "The problems we 
list, though, we take very seriously. 
We think these suggestions will make 
the Union more enjoyable for every-
one in it. If people aren't enjoying the 
Union, what is the point of having it?" 

The Liberals have two main com-
plaints. First, the Union constitution 
by requiring the use of the traditional, 
if somewhat pompous Robert's Rukr of 
Order encourages events such as floor-
fights and 
filibusters 
and also 
enhances the Union's image as pom-
pous and elitist. They focus this com-
plaint on the use of Robert's during 
speaker meetings. Robert's requires that 
a question to a speaker be addressed 
through the chairperson ('Mr. 
Speaker, does the Gentleman/Lady 
believe .. .'). 

The Liberals' second complaint has 
to do with the organization of the 
Union. They feel that, as one party 
member put it, "For better or worse, 
debate is a dying institution." And thus 
the PU's time and effort would be bet-
ter spent improving and expanding its 
speaker program. 

These are not radical reforms accor-
ding to the Liberals. Indeed, Hammer 
made a point of saying that he was not 
advocating that the Union drop entire-
ly its use of Robnt's. "In general these 
rules are very useful and necessary. 
However, in a public meeting, with an 
important speaker, there is no reason 
to force someone to speak through the 
chair. It looks silly. It made me laugh. 
Why shouldn't someone else laugh?" 

What Hammer suggests is that the 
Union adopt a policy of "polite over-
sight" of Robert's 
during speaker 
meetings. 

Doing this and strengthening the 
speaker program, Hammer and other 
Liberals believe, wiU attract many 
more people to the Union and improve 
its image. "We have got to get rid of 
the silliness [of Robert's and floorfights] . 
Then people will see what the PU real-
ly has to offer," Hammer said. The 
more people who are involved in the 
"If people aren't enjoying the 
Union, what Is the point of 
having It?" 
Union, he feels, the better it can do its 
job of providing an open forum for 
political discussion. 

For now, though, it seems unlikely 
that any of the Liberals' suggestions 
will be put into effect. The Union elec-
tions in December left the Liberals 
without a 
single member on the 
Union's Executive Board other than 
their party chairman. 

Also, 
Union's present Speaker, who is in 
charge of enforcing Robert's, 
is a 
staunch supporter of the rules. "I 
believe the rules are an important part 
of the Union," said Speaker Chris 
Bieda who is also a member of the Par-
ty of the Right. "It (the enforcement of 
Robert's) may drive a few people away, 
but we've always been able to get a 
balanced forum despite our strictures. 
Anyway, we are really much more lax 
about the rules than people think." 

Union President Joel Rubin, an In-
dependent Parry member, was even 
more to the point. "To say that people 
leave the Union because of Robert's- to 
me that is really a cop-out. I don't 
think addressing a speaker through the 
chair is really necessary, but at the 
same time I don't see why people have 
such a great aversion to it." He believes 
that there are other ways that the 
Union can attract more people. 

"I 
would 
like 
to 
see 
every 
undergraduate at Yale in the Political 
Union," said Rubin. "I believe we have 
something to offer each of them." He, 
howc:ver, does not feel that it is impor-
tant to realign the Union's structure to 
improve it. By salvaging the student 
debate program, adding more key-
noted debates and bringmg "thought-
provoking" people to address the 
Union, Rubin believes the Union can 
be strengthened. 

He agrees that the Union's reputa-
tion has been hurt by infighting in the 
past few years and thus he is determin-
ed to prevent that from recurring. "My

" If you expect the gigantic

main goal," Rubin said, "is to keep 
peace." He hopes that this peace com-
bined with a stronger program will in-
crease the number of renewed mem-
berships and thus lower the percentage 
of freshman and sophomore members. 

Rubin admits, however, that there 
are some things the Union in its pres-
ent form can do little about. Everyone 
in the Union, including the Liberals, 
agrees that a Progressive Party could 
not survive. "The radical left," said 
Rubin, "is interested in activism, not 
debate and discussion. We really just 
don't have a place for that group of 
Yale students." He and others also ad-
mit that in the end there is little the 
Union can do to substantially improve 
its speaker program. The Political 
Union does not pay honorariums to its 
speakers and thus must draw on its 
reputation and Yale's name to bring 
speakers here. 

That name and reputation have 
served the Union very well in the past. 
As well as being able to bring major 
Presidential candidates here during 
election years, the Union in the past 
few years has been able to set up such 
events as a nationally televised debate 
between Bill Buckley and George 
McGovern. Even today the Ptrs repu-
tation remains effective. 

"The speaker program is quite good 
as it is. Important people come here," 
said Gilmore. "Last term we had two 
cabinet officials, the Mayor of New 
York and Betty Friedan among many 
others. However, if you expect the 
gigantic speaker-a-week program-
well, we just don't have it." 

Nonetheless, the Union seems to 
provide an important service to its 
members. On this point everyone in 
the Union, including the critics in the 
Liberal Party, agree. In addition to the 
regular PU events which include ap-
proximately two dozen speakers a year 
and almost-weekly debates, each party 
offers its own calendar of events. The 
Liberals and Independents each have 
programs of internal debate and invite 
outside people to meet exclusively with 
them. The Liberals are also involved 
with a number of activist groups at 
Yale. Indeed, the Connecticut Com-
mittee for Handgun Control grew out 
of the Liberal Party. The Independent 
Party sponsors a trip to New York to 
meet political leaders. The Conser-
vative Party, due to its small size, of-
fers only a small program of events, 
though it does appear to have one of 
the stronger internal debate programs. 

~ 
The Party of the Right differs from 
the other parties. The POR never in-
vites outside speakers to meet with it; 
instead, it holds a weekly program of 
debate on topics ranging from the 
political (Resolved: 
Creation ism 
should be purged from the public 
schools) to the abstract (Resolved: 
Reason cannot survive the fall of God). 
But perhaps more than anything else, 
the POR is a social group for its core of 
members. 

Party Chairman Victor 
Lazaron admitted, "Undoubtably our 
members are closer, more incestuous if 
you will, than those in other parties. 
But then again, we put no pressure on 
our members. They can get as in-
volved as they want." 

Last semester the Union's program 
was "admittedly a bit feeble," accor-
ding to Bieda. This semester, however, 
the Union appears to be improving. 
Already they have presented a number 
of speakers including Carol Belamy of 
New York City in January and sena-
torial candidate Toby Moffett earlier 
this week. Also there have been a host 
of relatively well-attended student 
debates and major key-noted debates. 
Thus despite all the derision the Yale 
Union may receive and 
despite its sagging membership figures 
and internal attempts at reform, it still
