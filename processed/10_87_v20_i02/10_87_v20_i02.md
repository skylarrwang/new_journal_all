Sound lnvestmen·t 
It certainly differs from the standard 
donation by an Old Blue benefactor. 
Instead of in a check barely large 
enough to fit the zeroes, this gift, from 
a San Francisco usher, comes in 
disks-lots of them. Bob Kellman, an 
enthusiastic musical theater fan, 
recently donated one of the most 
extensive 
individual 
collections of 
musical theater LPs to the Yale 
Collection of Historical Sound 
Recordings (HSR). 

Since 1962, Kellman has collected 
what he calls "probably anything that's 
been recorded that is in any way 
connected with a musical." He has 
accumulated some 1500 records, many 
of which are autographed, and almost 
as many stories. Performers like Ethel 
Merman and Liza Minnelli have con-
fided private memories to Kellman, he 
says. In fact, Minnelli has commis-
sioned copies of rare recordings from 
him. 

From his association 
with per-
formers, Kellman learned of Yale's 
recordings archive. "I 
decided to 
donate my collection back in 1981," he 
says. "I was involved in the theater by 
being a stage doorman at the Golden 
Gate Theater, and I happened to know 
Gwen Verdon from my interest in 
theater and seeing shows. I spoke to 
her and said I happened to have one of 
the most complete collections of musi-
cal theater recordings on the West 
Coast, and she gave me a list of about a 
half a dozen places that might be in-
terested. I wrote to all of them and the 
response I got from Yale was what 
persuaded me to give it to them." 

Kellman visited HSR and met with 
the curator, Richard Warren (BK '59), 
that year. He originally intended to 
wait until after his death to send the 
collection but changed his mind aft~r 
the AIDS epidemic hit San Francisco 
full force. "I'm a gay man, and I have 
lost a lot of friends to AIDS," he 
explains. "I'm under the suspicion that 
I might get it, so I decided to ship the 
collection off while I was still alive." He 
started to send batches of his records 
last year. 

According to Warren, the donation 
4 The New .Journal/October 16, 1987 
has already helped some people in 
research. 
Last semester a college 
semi~ar entitled "Stephen Sondheim 
and the American Musical Theater 
Tradition". used a tape with musicals 
taken from Kellman's contribution. 
When Warren could not locate one · 
album, he called Kellman, who pro-
vided it from his private collection. 
Eventually he or his estate will "send off 
the rest of his music, Kellman says, 
including the rest of the records, some 
books, and a number of cassette and 
reel-to-reel tapes. 

While organizing his works, Kell-
man includes memories or tales he 
knows about particular musicals, 
stories which music lovers and even the 
performers 
themselves 
might 
not 
know. For example, South Pacific fans 
can learn from Kellman that the show's 
star, Mary Martin, appeared on stage 
at Yale in 1938. Honoring the wishes 
of a few of the greats, he says, he has 
kept some secrets to himself. 

Finding HSR takes a little detective 
work. Tucked away past the payroll 
department on the second floor of 
Sterling, the archive does not exactly 
bustle with activity. 
But inside, 
thousands of records crowd the book-
shelves: 78's mixed in with 33's, Bach 
within range of "The Wizard of Oz." 
And, somewhere within the musical 
jumble, a 
record autographed by 
Gwen Verdon, bearing the inscription 
"For Yale."

Last Call 
Yalies do not initiate all of New 
Haven's traditions. Located behind 
Timothy Dwight College, a pub called 
Malone's has been dedicated for over a 
half-century to Irish-style celebration 
for Yale students and city residents 
alike. But recent news that the building 
which houses the pub will be demol-
ished leaves its patrons wondering if 
the crumbling structure will carry the 
traditions of Malone's with it. 

For the handful of students, mostly 
from Silliman and TD, who frequent 
Malone's, the pub's closing will mean 
the end of a tradition. "It was like an in-
itiation into TD when the seniors would 
take us there on Sunday nights," re-
called Christina Ayala (TD '89). For 
many, the pub has'provided a welcome 
alternative to the jukebox blasting, 
socially fast-paced pizza joints around 
campus. At Malone's, customers don't 
treat beer as simply a means to an end; 
they consider drinking an art in itself. 

Last year, John Sylvain (TD '87) sat 
drinking a scotch and beer when a 
newcomer challenged him to "tang." 
Taking a sip, he responded, "No,. I'm 
going to drink this slowly so I can en-
joy it as it goes down." 

Poor lighting, a musty atmosphere, 
and 
a complete dissociation with ~ 
anything "Yale" characterize the inside 
of Malone's. Instead of "Hotel Califor-
nia," the jukebox offers an eclectic mix 
of less overplayed Motown, Irish folk 
songs, and rock. Distractions range 
from the futuristic Trivia-Quiz to the 
ancient dartboard. The walls are 
decorated not with drawings of"Yale in 
1875" or "The First Yale-Harvard 
Crew Race," but with drawings of 
Ireland, relics from Saint Patrick's 
Days gone by, and black-and-white 
photographs taken by a regular, Russ 
Southand. "Most of those were taken 
at the old location around the corner," 
Southand said. When asked what occa-
sion prompted one photo in which the 
people seemed especially festive, both .i 
owner and photographer laughed. 
"That was the wake we threw mourn-
ing the last day before the old Malone's 
closed in '72."

Fowl Play 
Laurie Kincade (ES '88) remembered 
it as if it happened yesterday. "It was 
quarter to seven, and I had just barely 
made it to dinner. Then I realized it 
was Chicken Basquaise Night. But 
there was none! Just some kind of 
chicken with herbs. I said, 'Is this 
chicken basquaise?' and the dining hall 
people looked at me like I was speaking 
a foreign language." 

A foreign language, indeed. The 
New Journal of September 4, 1987 
reported in English that "On Sept. 15, 
the Yale dining halls will offer chicken 
basquaise to 5000 people." Apparently, 
the students in Ezra Stiles were not 
among them. Students there were 
served herb chicken falsely labeled 
chicken basquaise. Amid charges of 
scandal, corruption, and cover-up in 
the highest echelons of the food ad-
ministration, the question resounded 
through the cement-and-steel Stiles 
dining hall- What did Ed Homa, 
manager of Stiles-Morse, know about 
the chicken substitution, and when did 
he know it? 

Homa claims not to have known 
much. The omission was "just an over-
sight. The basquaise was a last-minute 
substitution on the menu," he said . 
"We used to have a clerical person who 
would have caught it, but she's gone 
.. 

now." Homa added that he "apologized 
publicly" for the mix-up. 

In what may have been a desperate 
attempt to salvage Homa's career, 
Bruce Harris, 
the 
new assistant 
manager of Stiles-Morse, took the fall 
for the scandal. "The buck stops here 
on this one," he said. "We just missed it 
on the menu." Harris tried also to ex-
plain why a sign on the herb chicken 
called it basquaise. "We probably got 
the sign from the nutrition office, who 
duly gave it to the right person, who 
duly put it up." Informed Stilesians 
were not duped. "I knew that the bas-
quaise stuff was supposed to have 
tomatoes and peppers," Reyna Marder 
(ES '88) said. But Talia Bloch (ES '88) 
voiced anger at the substitution. "We 
were all deceived," she said. 

The dining hall administration 
seems to have weathered the scandal. 
Harris reported no complaints about 
the basquaise incident, and Homa, 
after returning from the "month's vaca-
tion in Florida" he took after the story 
broke, promised that the chicken 
would appear in its correct incarnation 
on a later menu. However, serious 
questions remain.- How did the 
alteration of menus take place? Was 
criminal tampering with Yale 
documents involved?- What hap-
pened to the "nine six-gallon cans of 
peeled tomatoes" that, according to 
New Journal reporter James Bennet 
(TD '88), awaited crushing in the 
Stiles-Morse kitchen?- Does anyone 
really want to see chicken basquaise 
back on the meriu? Although executive 
chef Tom DeDinas said that he had 
"gotten a lot of good comments" from 
dining hall managers in other colleges 
about the entree, some diners felt the 
chicken lacked excitement. Bennet 
refused to comment, and Sasha Grut-
man (BK '89), author of the recipe, did 
not return this reporter's phone calls. 
The two were reportedly seen dining 
together at Popeye's restaurant the 
evening of the fifteenth.

**Mac in the USSR**
**Author: Erin Kelly**

Between the Vines/Erin Kelly 
Mac in the USSR 
Pat Sajak and Vanna White flashed 
across the screen as the Russians 
watched in confused admiration. Van-
na looked radiant- she wore sequins 
and a million-dollar smile. The Soviets 
did not.· Pat spun the wheel and 
beckoned with his outstretched arm. 
Lips pursed over brown-edged teeth, 
his Russian audience followed the 
gesture, staring hard at the screen. 

The Soviets spoke to one another in 
confused tones as disparate clips from 
the program splashed at their faces. I 
stood among them, wanting to groan 
and explain that this technicolor image 
was not the essence of my native 
culture. But I kept silent, because they 
wanted to watch. 

I had not come to Russia to watch 
Wheel of Fortune. I arrived in Moscow 
last summer intending to step com-
pletely out of my own culture and into 
another for two short months. Impos-
sible. Within every circle of Soviet 
society that my life touched, people 
were fascinated by the United States. 

My first night in Moscow, a new 
Soviet acquaintance 
leaned coolly 
against a marble pillar of the metro sta-
tion and inquired, "So, how's Michael 
Jackson doing?" I discovered that, 
despite Soviet government propaganda 
portraying the U.S. as a decadent and 
exploitative society, many Russians 
see America as highly seductive, and 
its citizens as privileged golden people. 

Besieged with both idyllic and hor-
rific images of my own society, I 
became curious when American ac-
quaintances tOld me about a Moscow 
exhibit on American culture and 
technology, sponsored by the U.S. In-
formation Agency. I wanted to see my 
own government's representation of 
life in the United States. My acquain-
tances said that the line for "America" 
was four hours long, but that Amer-
icans could slip in the back door by 
showing a passport to the guard. 

Guiltily, I and two friends did just 
that. 

Expecting a Disneyland spectacle of 
apple-pie propaganda, I stepped inside 
the exhibit suspicious, but curious. 
A huge photograph of Ronald Rea-
gan's smiling face greeted me at the 
6 The New Journal/October 16, 1987 
door. A blur of television screens filled 
the wall beside him, illustrating, as the 
sign said in Russian, "The Democratic 
Process." MTV-style, technicolor im-
ages of the '84 presidential election 
flashed on and off. Reagan, Mondale, 
Ferraro, Bush, Hart, McGovern, and 
0;

the rest, handshaking, conceding, win-
ning. Each political image moved 
me- admiration for one candidate, 
contempt for another. As the responses 
ripped through me in a wave of heady 
culture shock, I realized that I . had. 
found a window back into my own 
society. Within this exhibit I stood on 
my own turf, a sensation I had not ex-
perienced since leaving the States. I 
watched the screens critically, but with 
a warm familiarity that came from 
responding to things American. 

The Russians, after glancing quickly 
at this display, filed past me in pursuit 
of the really good stuff. It was all there: 
televisions, 
microwaves, 
washing 
machines, computers, stereos- the 
place resembled a discount appliance 
store. Soviets shook their heads and 
sighed as they read the explanation 
cards describing each product in Rus-
sian. A Dodge 4-wheel drive vehicle 
was parked in the middle of the ex-
hibit, and the Soviets crowded around 
it, jostling for a look inside. A young 
man ran his finger solemnly along the 
polished surface. In my eyes, the large 
blue vehicle seemed to acquire new 
prestige. 

· In another corner, a crowd had 
gathered around a Macintosh com-
puter, the same type I use at school. 
While I regarded its all-too-familiar 
face with mixed emotions, the Rus-
sian.s 
touched the, Mac hesitantly, 
pokmg at the keyboard. Nothing was 
happening. One man reached ten-
tatively for the mouse, and his inability 
to manipulate it frustrated me as I 
watched. I stifled an impulse to grab 
the mouse and say, "Look, people! 
Macwrite, Save, Quit." 

I moved away from the Macintosh 
with the uncomfortable feeling that I 
was part of a wealthy estate which had 
let the peasants in for a day to gape. I 
walked through the crowd anony-
mously, vacillating between the im-
pulse to announce proudly that this 
was all mine and the overriding urge to 
keep silent out of embarrassment over l 
my conspicious wealth. I was thrilled 
to feel myself back in my culture, and I 
wanted to explain it to the Soviets as 
they had presented theirs to me, ap-
proaching each person to convey my 
own understanding of the marvels they 
observed. At the same time I wondered 
about my gover~'ment's motivations 
for displaying such prosperity. The 
Soviets appeared duly awed, but they 
admired the American accomplish-
ments as objects beyond their grasp. I 
overheard one Soviet tell his friend, 
"Well, they have and we don't have." 

. I wandered over to where Pat and 
Vanna were beckoning from a wall of 
televisions. Thirty-second images of 
other American programs, past ,and 
present, flashed by in this flickering 
montage. I fixed on the screens, in " 
dulging in a moment of nostalgia for 
television reruns. The Cosby Show ap-
peared in· one corner, vanished, then 
reappeared on another screen. The So-
viets stared hard at Cosby him-
self- Russians see few black people, 
and the Soviet government talks a 
great deal about racism in the States. 

An exuberant contestant was spin-
ning the Wheel of Fortune when a 
Soviet standing beside me made a 
remark about television technology 
to which I responded in my imperfect 
Russian. Noticing the accent, he asked 
where I was from. His eyebrows shot 
up when I answered. Americans in 
Moscow are still pretty rare, and he 
'grabbed his friend, telling him that he .I 
had found one. The exhibit featured 
Americans employed to answer visi-
tors' questions, but these men wanted 
an unofficial source. They ·seemed to 
have a mental list of burning questions

about the United States, and they 
flung them at me rapidly. I began to 
answer in stumbling Russian, and 
within minutes, a crowd had gathered 
around to listen. The questions started 
coming faster as I struggled to comprehend and answer. My American 
friends, Laslo and Michele, came up to 
help field the barrage of courteous but 
persistent questions. 
"Do you believe in God?" This from 
my first interlocutor. Explaining the 
idea of human spirit and a transcendent deity in Russian is no picnic, but 
the six or more people who had 
gathered to listen seemed to understand my words. Though I wondered 
for a minute if they thought I was 
crazy, their attention and respect 
reassured me that I was making sense. 
I finished with the God question and 
they threw me another- How much is 
a color television in America? A bit of 
a switch, I thought, but they waited for 
my answer with equal gravity. I said I 
had never shopped for a television,.but 
I estimated a starting cost of $300. I 
converted the price into rubles, a 
figure representing about three months' salary for the average Soviet. A 
polite middle-aged man followed up: 
How would you get the television 
home from the store? I thought the 
man had to be joking and looked at my 
audience, but it waited eagerly for my 
answer. Somewhat embarrassed, I said 
I'd probably use my car. That sent a 
charge through the crowd; few Soviets 
have cars, and as my audience looked 
at me with wonder I shuffled uneasily. 
Pursuing the strangely popular topic 
of the television purchase, the same 
man asked me how I would get the TV 
into my apartment. I replied sheepishly that my family owned its own 
home, which caused a bigger stir in my 
audience than the mention of the car. 
Moscow apartments rarely exceed 
three rooms. I told him my mother or 
father would probably help me carry 
the TV into the house. My audience 
nodded with interest. I puzzled over its 
fascination with this mundane topic, 
but then I thought of the seemingly inane questions I had asked Muscovites 
about trivial aspects of their daily lives. 
The middle-aged man wanted to 
confirm rumors he'd 
heard that 
America had both stores and television 
stations which operated 24 hours a 
day. I said it was true. He then wanted 
to know who paid for so much television. I asked the group if it understood 
the concept of advertising, 
and 
everyone looked confused. Explaining 
that if I wanted to produce a television 
show, I would need someone to sponsor 
it, I said that I might engage the financial support of a company like Coca-
Cola (a name the Soviets recognized), 
and let it use five minutes for advertisements. What kind of advertisement 
would this be? they asked. Well, I 
replied, you just get people to run 
around and sing, and I sang them the 
"It's the real thing" jingle. They 
laughed and said they understood. 
After an hour of this my friends and 
I were exhausted. We started to leave, 
pausing to arrange a future meeting 
with Larissa and Marina, two students 
from an economics institute who had 
quizzed Michele about American music. During this exchange, a young 
man interrupted and asked us to sign 
his souvenir program of "America." 
Embarrassed, we demurred, but he insisted. I signed one and looked up to 
find that, Soviet-style, a line had 
formed behind him. No one wanted to 
miss out. 
Feeling ridiculous, 
my 
friends and I wrote "vcevo dobrovo" 
(all the best) and signed our names in 
English. We shook hands and walked 
out of the building into the bright 
sunlight. 

For several days following our adventure, Michele and I worried that the 
Soviets had felt cowed by the demonstration of American prosperity. As we 
rode the metro to the dorm of the 
economics institute, we wondered if 
our new acquaintances would treat us 
with awkward deference. Instead the 
two women turned our perceptions upside down. 

They took Michele and me to a 
cafe/disco where we ate ham and cheese 
pizza and drank cognac through 
straws, in celebration of Larissa's last 
exam. When we left, Larissa showed 
the effects of her brandy as she linked 
arms with us and marched boldly 
down the sidewalk, recalling phrases 
from English class and pronouncing 
them with the stilted British accent she 
learned in school. Caught up in 
Larissa's frivolity, Michele glanced up 
at one of the ubiquitous Soviet banners 
and pronounced in solemn Russian, 
"We Are Building 
Communism!" 

Larissa started and asked eagerly, 
"You are?" 

Michele laughed and tried tactfully 
to explain that she'd simply repeated 
the words of the banner, but Larissa 
did not listen. With glowing excitement, she recalled the bounty she had 
witnessed at the exhibit. "Your production has reached an optimum level," 
she said happily. "You are at the ideal 
stage for revolution."

**Title: Into the Fray!**
**Author: Cynthia Cameros**
**Page number(s): 8-9**

Just mention his name. 
"A one-man academic hit squad," 
sneers Fareed Zakaria (BK '85) in The 
New Republic. Last December, the 
magazine Science appointed him "sheriff 
of scholarship." While Yale anthropologist Leopold Pospisil admires him, 
a Yale political scientist calls him "a 
jerk." Sterling Professor of Economics 
James Tobin, a Nobel Prize winner, 
says that "the last thing" he wants to do 
is to get into an argument with him. 
The chairman of the mathematics 
department declares him to be one of 
the most dedicated teachers at Yale. 
His students describe 
him as 
everything from "well-organized" to 
"confrontational" to "awful." 

Behind a cluttered desk, the conflicting images of Serge Lang- mathematician, professor, and member of 
the National Academy of Sciences 
(NAS)- fuse in the form of a small, 
wiry, nervously energetic man. Proud 
of making enemies, Lang thrives on 
confrontation; he seems as eager to 
raise hackles as he does to raise issues. 
In the latest of his series of academic 
8 The New Journal/October 16, 1987 
disputes, Lang is waging a campaign 
to prevent the election of a prominent 
Harvard political scientist, Samuel P. 
Huntington OE '46), to the NAS. 
When asked about his motivations, 
Lang erupts. "I don't want to live in a 
society which indoctrinates the young! 
... I don't indoctrinate the young; I 
teach them. I follow the rhetoric of the 
president of the University. It is they 
who don't! . . . It isn't for me to answer 
why I live by the rhetoric of freshman 
addresses. It is for them to answer why 
they do not!" 

Born in Paris in 1927, Lang immigrated with his parents to California 
13 years later. At 18, Lang earned 
his B.S. in physics at the California 
Institute of Technology. After a year 
and a half in the United States Army, 
he returned to academia to study 
philosophy at Princeton, switching to 
mathematics a year later. In 1951 he 
received his Ph.D. in mathematics. 
Rapidly ascending the academic ladder, Lang in 1955 became a professor 
at Columbia, where he stayed until 
1970. Hopping from Columbia to 
Princeton to Harvard, Lang landed at 
Yale in 1972 as a full professor, and 
has remained here since then. 

As a professor, Lang, who teaches 
both 
introductory and advanced 
classes, has drawn mixed reviews. According to his students, he is a demanding teacher who fires questions at 
them during class. Some students find 
his confrontational style stimulating. 
"Fifty minutes of math is not an easy 
way to spend one's time, but Lang kept 
it interesting by keeping the students 
involved," says Harry Robinson (DC 
'89), who took one of Lang's calculus 
courses during first semester of his 
freshman year. Robinson recalls that 
Lang's typical response to a question 
was: "You tell me the answer." Lang 
makes the questioner work through 
each step of the problem to ensure that 
they will understand. 

But other students criticize Lang for 
his impatience and for not thoroughly 
presenting the material. "You had to 
be a math whiz to understand him, as 
opposed to someone trying to learn 
math," says Colin Goldman (BK '90). 


Students say that the textbook for 
Mathematics 120, written by Lang, 
duplicated the material in the lectures. 
As a result, Goldman says, there was 
"nothing to fall back on." Many 
students feel that the text presented too 
few drills and examples. This year the 
mathematics department 
replaced 
Lang's text for three levels of introductory calculus classes. According 
to Ronald Coifman, the department's 
chairman, "We usually rotate books 
every few years." 

Despite 
his intense teaching 
schedule, Lang has not devoted his 
career wholly to academics. In 1966 he 
discovered his second "passion," 
politics. During a year's sabbatical at 
University of California, Berkeley, he 
wrote three or four advertisements for 
Democrat Robert Scheer's congressional campaign. Though Scheer, an 
early opponent of the Vietnam War, 
lost with 45 percent of the vote, Lang 
continued his political involvement 
when 
he returned 
to Columbia 
University that fall. In his book Rats in 
a Box (1970), 
which describes 
American society's reaction to the war, 
Lang writes that he mediated between 
the administration and the students 
over campus anti-war activity. 

Academia prevailed in the end, 
however. In 1970, Lang felt that his 
political involvement had become too 
consuming. "It would have killed me as 
a mathematician, so I put an abrupt 
stop to it," Lang says firmly. "But now 
I'm in pretty good control. Although it 
certainly detracts from the time I could 
give to researching mathematics, it 
does not kill it. And I still write and 
research papers." In the classroom, 
at times Lang combines his politics and his 
teaching, distributing material related 
to his causes. Goldman complained 
that "I didn't understand his math, and 
I didn't like him wasting time talking 
about letters to the NAS and the Harvard man he was trying to kick out." 

A stark corner office on the first floor 
of Leet Oliver Memorial Hall has 
served as Lang's headquarters in his 
battle against "the Harvard man," 
Samuel Huntington. There are no 
posters on the walls, no photographs 
on the desk. Five metal file cabinets 
two bookcases contain the 
evidence of Lang's furious career, 
which has yielded 32 mathematics 
books and 72 articles. From behind his 
metal desk covered with exam papers, 
a telephone, and a typewriter, Lang 
fires off his denunciations. Speaking 
quickly with a distinct accent, he 
declares, "What I have shown is the extent to which what Huntington peddles 
is, in fact, political and represents 
political opinions. His book (Political 
Order in Changing Societies) is a tissue of 
political opinions passed off as 
science." Huntington's work, Lang 
argues, is not sufficiently scientific to 
qualify him for membership in the 
NAS. 

Founded in 1863, the NAS is a 
prestigious organization with 1,523 
members that advises the federal 
government on scientific matters 
through its National Research Council. Election to the NAS is considered 
among the highest of American scientific awards. In 1986 Huntington's 
election seemed secure, several NAS 
members say. Huntington had impressive credentials. The director of 
Harvard's Center for International 
Relations, at that time he was president 
of the American Political Science 
Association and had advised the State 
Department, the Defense Department, 
and the National Security Council. 

Challenges in the Academy are rare, 
according to NAS member Jared Diamond, in an August 1987 essay in 
Discover magazine. Diamond writes 
that there have been only two in the 
eight years since his election to the 
Academy. 

For his part, Lang, a 
member of the NAS for only one year, 
seemed an improbable challenger. His 
field, pure mathematics, is remote 
from the social sciences in which Huntington works. Nevertheless, Lang attacked. 

In March 1986, Lang received the 
first NAS ballot since his election to the 
He 
recognized Huntington's name from an article written 
by mathematician Neal Koblitz. In the 
article, Koblitz, who had supported 
Lang in a previous academic dispute, 
dismissed 
Huntington's use of 
mathematics in 
his 
textbook as 
"mystification, 
intimidation." 
Lang spent "three or four hours" 
reading sections of Political Order in 
Changing Societies, focusing on the sections cited by Koblitz. He then wrote 
Bryce Crawford, secretary of the NAS,

opposing, but not formally challeng-
ing, Huntington's election. In the let-
ter, Lang requested only that copies of 
Koblitz's article be distributed to all 
NAS members "so that they can get a 
better idea of the kind of thing Hun-
tington does before they vote for or 
against him." 


In fact, Lang says that he had deci-
ded against challenging Huntington's 
nomination formally until he received 
a letter from julian Wolpert, chairman 
of the N AS section which includes 
social and political scientists. In his let-
ter, Wolpert calls Koblitz's article 
"scurrilous journalism" and criticizes 
Lang for trusting the article over the 
recommendations of NAS members 
from the social sciences. He advises 
Lang that the Academy's challenge 
"was intended to be used responsibly." 


In his office, Lang explains, "So I had 
this brief experience with Bryce 
Crawford. He sent copies to Wolpert. 
And I sent to Wolpert my letter saying 
I'm giving up. Wolpert simultaneously 
doesn't know that and writes me this 
letter which is both stupid and in-
sulting. And then, of course, I reacted. 
Okay, if they want to fight, I'll get in 
too." 


From the ensuing war, Lang emerg-
ed victorious. Huntington twice failed 
to gain enough votes for election to the 
Academy, in 1986 and 1987. A can-
didate challenged at an annual meeting 
is removed from consideration unless 
two-thirds of the members present vote 
to support the scientist. Huntington's 
nomination failed 
to secure the 
necessary number of votes at both 
meetings. Though other NAS 
members formally challenged Hun-
tington both times, Lang's campaign 
against the political scientist appears to 
have been critical in blocking his elec-
tion. In the three mailings he sent to 
NAS members, academicians, and the 
media before the two elections, Lang 
denounced Huntington for "profes-
sional incompetence and defective 
scholarship." Lang's criticisms have 
some support in the Academy, judg:ng 
by the approximately 35 favorable let-
ters he received from NAS members . . 
Several members have claimed that 
Huntington's advocacy of the Yietnam 
War also contributed to his rejection 
from the Academy, though Lang says 
that he attacked only Huntington's 
scholarship. 


In order to "demolish the opposition" 
and to prohibit another nomination, 
Lang sent out his largest mailing ever 
during the second week of September. 
He shipped the 43-page packet to 
over 1800 people. The effort cost him 
approximately $5,000. In the cover let-
ter Lang made an appeal for contribu-
tions, which has so far brought in over 
$1,800. The centerpiece of the mailing 
is an 11-page article with 17 footnotes, 
"On a Recent Non-election to the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences," in which 
Lang restates his criticisms. Lang is 
trying to confront Huntington and his 
supporters on their professional stomp-
ing grounds, the American Political 
Science Association, by submitting the 
article for publication in the APSA's 
journal, PS. The 'article, which Lang 
sent to the magazine on Aug. 17, has 
not been published. 


Lang's campaign has captured 
headlines in The New York Times, The 
Boston Globe, Time, and Science. The ar-
ticles attribute the NAS conflict to ten-
sions between hard and soft scientists 
and support the idea that Huntington's 
early support o(the Vietnam War con-
tributed to hts rejection. "Blood Lust in 
Academia," a searing article in The 
New Republic by Fareed Zakaria, reports 
that Lang, by "focusing on a particular 
scholar who has few pretensions to 
hard science- no game theory, no ex-
pected utility models, no rational 
choice analysis- without explaining 
how his limits are not those inherent in 
social science . . . has turned what 
could have been an interesting debate 
about natural and social sciences into a 
crude, unsubstantiated witch-hunt 
with strong political overtones." 


Although Lang admits that Zakaria's 
article made him appear "silly," he 
said, "I couldn't have hoped for 
anything more." 


The 
article 
falls apart, Lang 
says, because it supports Huntington 
with flawP.d evidence. Zakaria quotes 
Huntington defending the part of his 
textbook which Lang criticized in his 
mailings. In the textbook, Huntington 
refers to a survey that categorizes 
South African society as "satisfied." 
Huntington asserts that, "When this 
study ... was done in the early 1960s, 
there had been no major riots, strikes, 
or disturbances" in South Africa. Lang 
points out that, in fact, a number of 
riots and incidents of repression, in-
cluding the Sharpeville Massacre, took 
place during this period. In his office, 
Lang sighs and waves his hands. 
"What I see over and over again is the 
same pattern. Of course, Zakaria and 
the editors of The New Republic would 
not have printed this imbecility if the 
pattern of their thinking wasn't 
directed along [these lines]. It didn't 
occur to them to go to the library to 
check it out." Though Lang has written 
a 20-page response to Zakaria's article, 
he has not mailed it to the magazine. 
He worries that the New Republic editors 
might alter the piece to distort his 
points and thereby avoid acknowledg-
ing their errors 


Zakaria's article presents another 
weapon which Lang has stored in the 
arsenal he maintains against Hun-
tington: the "Huntington File." Since 
Lang recommenced his political ac-
tivities in 1977, he has recorded his 
epistolary battles to clean up academia 
and the media in his "files." A stapled 
volume that includes photocopied cor-
respondence, documents, 
and 
newsclips, a file can span hundreds of 
pages. So far, Lang has assembled 
nine of them. 


Lang describes the process of mak-
ing a file as a "cat and mouse game." 
He leans forward over his desk, his 
eyes staring ahead. "I know the process 
I'm engaged in. I go into the model I 
make in my mind about what goes on, 
in pitting my wits against theirs." Lang 
shifts in his seat, but his eyes do not 
waver. "I try to create a stage where 
they will not have their usual defenses. 
Where they will make false statements 
I will bring them ' out. I try to make 
them express themselves in ways where 
they will be checked out, and I can 
compare the realities which they create 
as they go along." 


At the beginning of each file, the 
correspondence takes place principally 
between Lang and a few opponents. As 
more people write to Lang, the case 
begins to expand. Leaning back rn his 
chair, Lang illustrates by moving his 
finger in an ever-widening spiral. The 
"carbon copy" lists at the bottom of 
Lang's letters can swell to hundreds of 
names. Lang tucks letters of support 
into his files to fend off charges that he 
has no backers. In the Huntington 
File, he has included copies of some of 
the approximately 35 supportive letters 
from NAS members. Five Academy 
members also sent him critical letters, 
which he has not included in the file. 


The older, bound files sit in his 
cabinets and book cases, until someone 
requests a copy or Lang chooses to give 
one away, as he has done in some of his 
classes. The Huntington File remains 
unbound; Lang is still accumulating 
material. 


The File, a 700-page book that Lang 
published in 
1981, 
describes 
the 
1977-79 war pitting him against two 
sociologists: Seymour Martin Lipset 
and Everett Carll Ladd, Jr._ Referring 
to the sociologists as "parasites on the 
academic community," Lang attac;ked

them for a survey whose questions he 
considered 
prejudiced 
and 
unanswerable. In a statement included 
in The File, Lipset and Ladd responded 
that "Prof. Lang charges us with a 
failure to resolve each and every am-
biguity. It may be that Prof. Lang, un-
trained in the social sciences, is simply 
misinformed about the nature of social 
research." 


In both the Ladd-Lipset and Hun-
tington cases, Lang, a hard scientist, 
criticized the standards of soft scien-
tists. When he first looked into Hun-
tington's work, Lang predicted that the 
fight would resemble his earlier one 
against the two sociologists. With the 
same flurry of vitriolic correspondence 
"I don't want to live in 
a society which 
indoctrinates the 
young!" 
with which he brought Ladd and 
Lipset before the public eye, he 
turned the secretive National Academy 
of Sciences into a public battlefield. 


Lang's evidence consists only of a 
tiny portion of Huntington's work-a 
few 
pages each from two books and 
two articles. He says that by insisting 
that he read more of Huntington's 
work, his critics are simply trying to 
protect themselves. When asked how 
he could justify an attack based on 
such limited evidence, Lang reacts 
angrily, striking the desk with his 
hand. "The question is not the page 
count. The question is the significance 
of what I pick!" Lang argues that he 
needed to find only a few important 
flaws to justify his attack. 


He claims he found them. In Hun-
tington's widely-used textbook, Political 
Order in Changing Societies, Lang singles 
out a page on which Huntington em-
ploys mathematical formulae to ex-
press social circumstances. The article 
he submitted to PS quotes Koblitz's at-
tack on Huntington's book. Koblitz 
argues that the equations, such as 
"Social mobilization/economic devel-
opment = social frustration," result 
in a false "impression of precision and 
profundity." And he objects to Hun-
tington's correlating terms like 
"frustration" and "instability" and com-
ing up with a precise number: ".50." 


Huntington 
protests in 
The 
New 
Republic that he does not intend his 
equations to 
be mathematically 
rigorous. "They are meant to be a 
shorthand method to sum up a com-
plicated argument that I do detail," he 
says. Several political scientists say 
that 
Huntington rarely uses 
mathematics. 


Lang also criticizes the 1966 survey 
which Huntington uses in his textbook 
to characterize South Africa as a 
"satisfied society." Conducted by Ivo 
K. and Rosalind L. Feierabend, the 
survey 
won an award 
from 
the 
American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science when it was 
published. Lang says the six "satisfac-
tion" indices, including radios and 
telephones, on which the Feierabends 
based their assessment "failed spec-
tacularly to take into account what is 
important to 20 million blacks." To in-
validate the survey's conclusion, Lang 
has prepared a collage of 61 New York 
Times articles which report strikes and 
riots in South Africa between 1951 and 
1960, when the Feierabends were con-
ducting their survey. 


When asked about Lang's attack on 
Huntington's work, Yale professors in 
fields related to the dispute give varied 
responses. 


None entirely discount 
Lang's objections, and none give an 
unqualified endorsement of Hun-
tington's work. According to George 
Mostow, a mathematics professor and 
a member of the NAS, "The attack on 
Huntington could be seen by impartial 
observers as being too narrowly based. 
. . . However, as the evaluation of 
Huntington's papers progressed, it was 
not just mistakes of exposition but 
mistakes of substance. He ignored in-
formation freely available in the pages 
of The New York Times." Though some 
political 
scientists feel 
that Hun-
tington's work is flawed, they all seem 
to regard Lang's attack as an indict-
ment of their field itself. Professor 
David Mayhew says that Huntington 
is "one of the finest political scientists, 
widely thought to be such . . . . Lang 
is making a category mistake by sup-
posing that scholarship in political 
science is as innocent of what he 
would think is opinion, as what is in 
mathematics . . . . By Lang's stan-
dards, political science as a whole is not 
scientific enough to warrant inclusion 
in the NAS." 


The NAS itself fails to resolve the 
question of standards. The Academy 
solicits nominations by asking 
members to submit names of scientists 
"worthy of being proposed for nomina-
tion .... "A spokesperson for the NAS 
said that the candidates should be 
"outstanding" and "have achieved 
scientific recognition in their field." 
Apparently, the members must exer-
cise their own discretion to define 
"outstanding" and "scientific." 


The Huntington conflict spilled over 
onto the Yale campus last spring. As a 
student in H. Bradford Westerfield's 
class, "Introduction to International 
Relations," Joshua Katz (BR '89) 
found that he was required to read 
Huntington's Political Order in Changing 
Societies. While taking Lang's introduc-
tory calculus class in the fall, Katz had 
received a copy of Koblitz's article 
criticizing the book. "I took home the 
material, read it, believed what (saw, 
and decided that it was something I 
really believed in," he says. After com-
pleting Lang's course, Katz asked 
Lang how he could get involved. "He 
said to write 
a 
letter to Science 
magazine." Without having read the 
textbook, Katz did just that. 


It was Lang's idea, says Katz, to 
distribute copies of the letter, still un-
published, in Westerfield's class. "I was 
about to dump the copies of the letter 
on a table and leave them there, but 
said, "Wait a minute, I better ask 
Westerfield's opinion," Katz recalls. 
When Katz asked Westerfield, "He 
Professor H. Bradford Westerfield
believes in Samuel Huntington. 
requested that I not do that. He said that 
my letter would 'take too much TA 
preparation and would take time away 
substance 
of 
book." Westerfield later wrote to Katz 
and met with him. Westerfield refuses 
to discuss either communication. 


Westerfield explains that he did not 
prevent but rather "discouraged" Katz 
from passing out his letter. "I didn't 
consider the concerns in that letter cen-
tral to the particular concerns of my 
course. I 
didn't want to distract 
students from these particular concerns 
by raising other concerns that might be 
important in their own right but 
weren't central to my course." 


Without mentioning his relationship 
to Katz, Lang describes the incident in 
the article he submitted to PS. He also 
quotes from a letter that Westerfield 
sent him which the political scientist 
calls "a handwritten, private letter." 


Lang writes that Westerfield's letter 
"merely asserted that Huntington was 
President of the American Political 
Science Association. That fact plus his 
life-long familiarity with [Huntington] 
and his works was enough for him!" 


When asked about the contents of 
the letter, Westerfield declines to com-
ment. "It was a private letter to him," 
he says. "I had no expectation that he 
would publicize it . . . . I don't intend 
to carry on an argument with Serge 
Lang in public. Nor do I want to carry 
on any argument with Serge Lang." 


Westerfield, who studied with Hun-

tington first at Yale and then in a 
graduate program at Harvard, argues 
that having served as president of the 
American Political Science Association 
makes Huntington "by definition" an 
outstanding political scientist. 


Westerfield charges, "Lang is trying 
to tell me how to teach my course. 
Academic freedom says I can teach my 
course as I want to teach my course 
and assign the books I want to assign, 
and I don't have to answer to anybody 
about that . . . anybody except my 
own students." 


According to Lang, professors like 
Westerfield cause our educational 
system to turn out uncritical minds. 
"Lang is trying to tell 
me how to teach my 
course. Academic 
freedom says I can 
teach my course as I 
want to . . . " 


"Students are untrained to tell the dif-
ference between opinion and fact. On 
the contrary, they are trained to accept 
everything as a fact, including that 
South Africa is a satisfied society," he 
says. "And when the readers are skep-
tical enough, like Joshua Katz, they 
are shut up by Westerfield." 


For Lang, Katz's experience with 
Westerfield reflects the issues raised by 
the Huntington conflict. Both Wester-
field and the NAS cite authority and 
stress "collegiality" rather than answer-
ing legitimate criticism. By attacking 
Huntington, Lang hopes to shake up 
the academic community so that it 
becomes more critical towards its own. 


"It comes to the point that neither the 
professors nor the students can tell the 
difference between a fact, a perception 
of a fact, an opinion, and what is 
neither. I would like people trained so 
they can tell the difference."

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
To reach your chair in the meeting room, you walk past the long, wooden benches in the back, past the small camera crew and the clusters of aldermen, a few of whom you recognize. Holding thick packets, and talking informally, they come from Wooster Square, from Newhallville, from Westville, from the Hill. Somehow, things seem different than they did before the election. As soon as the officers of the board get settled, the meeting will come to order. They are seated up front, facing the representatives. Most of the aldermen are older than you, and many have been connected to New Haven politics longer than you've been alive. You learned this from months of studying the city, writing fliers and table tents, speaking at teas, and knocking on doors to explain yourself. You no longer have to convince anyone you can do the job. You just have to do it. 
Your name is Katie Kenney, Andrew Michaelson, or Lisa Valentovish, and you represent a ward of the city composed almost entirely of Yale students. Historically, your position on the board has been unique. Not just your youth but your constituency sets you apart. Your voters make few demands on you for jobs or municipal services. For this reason, you enjoy a certain freedom from the city's political "machine," especially if-like most past Ward 1 aldermen- you have little interest in running again. This freedom will enable you to act independently on issues without worrying about the needs of your ward. But you will risk remaining an outsider, as you are now, new to political office and fairly new to New Haven. Your fellow aldermen expect you to serve only one term and to approach your job as you did your campaign, fixed on big issues and ideas. 

Those ideas preoccupied Joel Ratner (BK '86) when he first joined the board in the summer of 1985. Originally appointed by Mayor Biagio DiLieto to replace a Yale graduate who had left for law school, Ratner retained his seat in an election three months later. In the course of his term, he has gained the kind of practical experience that the candidates hoping to replace him anticipate. Now 23 years old, Ratner has grappled with the Board's factions, his own naivete, and most important, the problems of New Haven. He takes his job personally and talks about it that way. In conversation, his only fault is that he strays from the topic. But his virtue is that he admits his faults. "I came expecting issues, written in bold letters. There's this incredible tendency to simplify. The more I've learned about New Haven, the more I realize that's a mistake and not really an effective way to frame those questions that you will ask and be asked," he says. 

Understanding the constraints of cramped agendas and two-week gaps between meetings, the other board members had a sharper sense of how to get things done. Ratner thought in headings-"downtown development," "public education," "the poor"-and was disappointed to find many of government's concerns scattered and trifling, ranging from the choice of a police station's furnace to the wording of a "pooper scooper" law. But he now appreciates the place of these issues in municipal government. Looking back, he rolls his eyes as he recalls the abstract approach he brought to the board. This year, the three candidates have supplied table tents and letters on most of the big issues facing New Haven. At their first public meeting together, the discussion of education became so theoretical as to draw the question, "Should Yale be forced to hire a certain number of workers from New Haven?" One of the candidates began to respond when a voice from the back called out, "I would warn you that that's illegal." Everyone turned around. The voice belonged to Ratner. 

The candidates themselves are aware of the abstract nature of the campaign, and Valentovish (TC '89) feels especially frustrated by it. As the Republican candidate, she says her table tents seek to engage people with facts instead of statements like "here's a social problem, vote for me, because I will change it." She complains that the campaign so far has centered on which candidate is the most socially conscious. Reading one of Kenney's fliers, she says critically, "She's been active. Yeah, that's nice. But getting people to register to vote doesn't equal working on the downtown council observing the dynamics between private and public sectors." 

That may not be true. According to Kenney (BK '88), "registering people to vote involved dealing with a city bureaucracy whose mission "was to do as little work as possible . . . . I decided to decisively cut through the red tape and do it right and be cheerful the whole time." She also points out that any campaign must emphasize issues in order to educate people. Like Valentovish, she claims that she can handle the city's practical side, too. 

But even separating the practical from the abstract indicates how differently someone from Yale views New Haven politics. Ward 1 consists of eight residential colleges, Old Campus, and the Law School, as well as a few residential streets-so few, in fact, that, after graduating, Ratner worried about meeting the requirement to live in the ward. With virtually no pressure from constituents, Yale's representative has time to sit back and think about the city. The next election is not at stake. A childhood neighborhood is

hot at stake. "Many members have 
culminated a life of political activity by 
coming on the board," says Martin 
Dunleavy, the board's majority leader. 
"But it's almost always a stepping stone 
for the Yale alderperson. They'll leave 
and then go do 'real politics' someplace 
else." 

Ratner and oth.ers involved in Ward 
1 politics recognize this problem. They 
try to avoid innocent statements about 
f .,1. going "home" for the holidays or, as 
happened with one former alderper-
son, driving a car with out-of-state 
license plates. But they still have a bad 
reputation for running through New 
Haven politics. In May 1985, an 
editorial in The New Haven Register 
sharply criticized Ward 1 aldermen. 
"No question the young people are 
likely to bring a great deal of energy, 
along with their inexperience and im-
maturity, to their service as aldermen," 
the article read. "But is youthful ex-
uberance sufficient for 
adequate 
representation, when some of them are 
called away to post-graduate studies or 
career-opening jobs before their o'ne 
and only two-year term is finishea? 
.... We have our doubts." 

A local radio show aired a rebuttal to 
_.. the Register editorial, emphasizing the 
,of 
•.Y 
ood 
g 
attendance records and con-
tributions of Ward 1 aldermen. But the 
criticism has since come up again. 
Ratner promised in his campaign to 
complete his full term, and he says he 
has a deeper commitment to New 
Haven than many people realize. That 
commitment grew when he graduated 
from Yale. Working in the city gave 
him a better sense of the New Haven, 
as opposed to the Yale, community. 
One year into his term, he got a job 
with the Connecticut Food Bank, a 
private nonprofit group which 
distributes irregular but usable food 
products, such as missized cans of 
~oup, to nonprofit organizations that 
serve the hungry. As part of his job, 
Ratner recently helped set up two new 
soup kitchens in New Haven. He 
laughs as he talks about his role. Pic-
ture this, his skeptical look says, pic-
ture this man running around com-
parison shopping for pots and pans. 
Unlike Kenney, both Valentovish and Michaelson claim that they have 
no political goals beyond the New Haven board. 

He trails off in the next breath, his face 
becoming serious. Now, the object of 
comparison is himself. "I was a better 
alderperson when I was not a student," 
he says. 

Among this year's candidates, only 
Kenney will graduate next year; both 
Valentovish and Michaelson (CC '90) 
have further terms at Yale. Not sur-
prisingly, as students they are led to 
view their prospective experience on 
the board as just that: experience. 
Running on the Green Party ticket, 
Michaelson says that "as a student it's a 
fabulous education to get involved with 
people who do community activism. 
I've had the chance to talk to people 
from 
AIDS 
groups, 
neighborhood groups . . . . I think 
Yale students don't recognize how 
much New Haven influences their 
lives." 

Michaelson does not call 
New 
Haven "home" but says he feels a deep 
commitment to the city because he 
lives here now. Valentovish, on the 
other hand, says she would feel com-
fortable calling New Haven home even 
after she graduates, partly because it 
reminds her of her neighborhood in 
Pittsburgh. But regardless of the can-
didates' interest in the city, none of 
them has family in New Haven and 
none of them has lived here for more 
than four years. For these reasons 
alone, they will find themselves at a 
political disadvantage when they first 
arrive on the board. 

Twenty-eight of the 30 seats on the 
New Haven Board of Aldermen are oc-
cupied by Democrats. The other two 
belong to Republicans, who have ac-
quired a more liberal reputation than 
that of their party. A commonly held 
view of New Haven politics maintains 
that the board often works as a support 
system for the DiLieto administration; 
it has been described as "a rub-
berstamp board" or the product of"the 
Democratic machine." 

Joe Carbone, executive assistant to 
the 
mayor, 
considers 
term 
"machine" insulting to the electorate of 
the city, but few politicians deny the 
machine's existence. Ratner describes 
the system as "quid pro quo," saying 
that a number of representatives have 
family members on the city's payroll. 
But while· he recognizes that the 
machine exists, Ratner grows angry 
over the 
idea of a 
monolithic 
Democratic Party. "As long as I'm on 
the board," he says, "the Democratic 
Party is not monolithic. It makes me 
mad, 
because it says 
I'm an 
automaton. And that is offensive to me 
after I've spent two years thinking 
about these issues." 

As the Democratic candidate, Ken-
ney has wprked most closely with the 
party in New Haven, and she also 
resents the party's stereotype. She 
thinks that Democrats have two 
distinct advantages over Republicans 
or Green Party members in the Ward 
-1 seat. First, they have the freedom to 
vote against the administration when 
the need arises. And second, they have 
the "fundamental alliance" belonging 
to Democrats on the board. Her op-
ponents, Kenney says, "talk about be-
ing able to be critics from outside. But 
they really will be outside and left out. 
I don't think any Yale student can 
march in and start telling the board 
what to do from outside." 

In terms of her political approach, 
Kenney follows much the same line of 
reasoning as Ratner, who has evolved 
into something of an independent 
thinker on the board. At the beginning 
of his term, other aldermen waited to 


Right now, Ratner considers Kenney heavily favored to win this year's 
Ward 1 race. 

see how he would interact with dif-
ferent 
forces: 
pro -DiLieto, 
Republican, independent Democrat. 
"He started out as 'I'm brighter. I'm 
here to save the world.' He started out 
rather naive," says Chuck Allen, 
representative from Newhallville. One 
of the 
board's most 
independent 
voices, Allen entered city politics ten 
years ago at about the same age Ratner 
is now. 

Having worked with a number of 
Ward 1 aldermen, Allen has recognized a 
definite evolution during most of their 
terms. "It's a unique situation. In very 
few other cities can you walk in and be 
on the board after a year or two in 
town. For that reason, not because 
you're younger or a student, you 
necessarily go through a period of ad-
justment and growth. Without being 
condescending, I'd describe all Yale 
aldermen as going through a period of 
development. All of them start out 
with a kind of textbook attitude about 
their job, armed with the constitution 
and charter on the one hand and on the 
other hand having to respond to an en-
trenched machinery and a very needy 
urban poor population." 

Observers say that after some time 
on the board, Ward 1 aldermen realize 
that 29 other people must enter 
into their plans to change the city. 
They gain political savvy, and their 
transformation does not go unnoticed. 
According to Allen, Ratner became a 
bridge between "the yuppie profes-
sionals of the board and the black com-
munity members of the board." His in-
dependence, however, did not always 
impress those aldermen loyal to the ad-
20 The New JournaVOctober 16, 1987 
ministration. Martin Dunleavy, alder-
person from Ward 27, says that as a 
member of the Democratic Socialists of 
America, 
he has 
a 
left-of-center 
philosophy but an old-player style. In 
the blunter language of other 
aldermen, that means he ends up, 
more of~en than not, voting for legisla-
tion supported by the mayor, tho~gh h_e 
may disgree with it. From Dunleavy'S' 
point of view, Ratner failed on the 
board in one sense because he never 
became an inside player but chose in-
stead to remain an independent, a 
"loner" on the board. 

But that "loner" status enabled 
Ratner to win the support of different 
factions. The board as a whole sup-
ported him, as it demonstrated by 
picking him to run for the single alder-
manic position on the City's Board of 
Finance. "Being trusted by all elements 
of the board like that was no mean ac-
complishment for a Yale student who's 
only been on the board a couple of 
years. He had all the black votes, all of 
the minority poor votes," Allen says. 

Among the boards set up by the mayor 
to run the city, the Board of Finance 
has the most power. As the aldermen's 
representative for the last eight or ten 
years, Louisa DeLauro of Wooster 
Square has, by all accounts, given un-
wavering support to the mayor. Run-
. ning Ratner against her was a signficant 
political 
move for the 
Board of 
Aldermen because it represented an in-
dependent undercurrent on the board. 
The decision to run was also an im-
portant personal move for Ratner, who 
says he would have thought differently 
about abandoning a second term if he 
had won that election. He did not win, 
but he did suffer through a tie vote and 
some hard blows from the city's 
machine. Thinking back on those 
weeks, he looks away as if trying to 
remember a particular moment which 
unlocks the feeling of the race. Once he 
finds it, he looks straight ahead again 
and nods. H e describes the feeling in 
one word. "Hellish," he says. "It was a 
real old-fashioned political brawl. 
There was fierce politicking going 
on .... In hindsight there were a couple t) 
...! 
of things I did that were really naive. 
It's all behind the scenes.'' One event 
involved a supporter on the board who 
ended up abstaining from the vote 
because, as Allen describes it, his wife 
was a cousin of DeLaura's and was 
harassed about , fhe election. Ratner 
mentions another incident, in which a 
supporter on the board was told that if 
he didn't vote for Del.auro, one of his 
constituents would not get a job at the 
fire department, 

But despite these bad moments, 
Ratner still considers the Board of 
Finance election one of two major 
highlights of his term. The other, un-
questionably, was his plan for tlie city 
to convert the National Hotel into 35 
to 50 low-income housing units. While 
this original idea did not pass on the ~ ,
board, the city did agree to find com-
parable housing units scattered 
throughout downtown New Haven. 

What's more, Carbone says that the 
city now anticipates Ratner's objec-
tions to certain projects before they 
reach the board. And the DiLieto ad-
ministration has created HOME, an 
organization designed to administer 
the current housing plan and any 
others in the future. "It's only a small 
part of the solution, the big solution," 
Ratner says, smiling slightly. "But big 
solutions almost never happen." 

So he puts his faith in the smaller 
ones and uses his compromising ability 
to promote them. Ratner has a good 
rapport with the administration, ,# 
despite the fact that he has presented 
them with opposition, and also ·enjoys 
a reputation for thinking on his. own. 
John Einhorn, Republican- represen-
tative from Westville, has a dimmer


tative from Westville, has a dimmer view of most other Ward 1 aldermen. 
He says that the seat "theoretically 
should afford a lot of independence. 
Unfortunately, what's always hap-
pened is the representatives felt they 
should do what the Democratic Party 
thought they should do." 

A ten-year veteran of the board, 
Einhorn views Ratner as one of the 
most 
independent and effective 
aldermen in the history of Ward 1. But 
in the future, he would like to see the 
,. • Green Party have a stronger voice on 
the board, one they could use against 
the Democrats. He feels that the 
Democrats have such a tight hold on 
city government that they are not ac-
countable for their failures. "The city 
really rivals traditional Chicago im-
ages. Tammany Hall had nothing on 
some of the things that happen in New 
Haven;" he says. As a recent example 
of the city's mismanagement, he points 
to the scandal over the parking 
authority; for the past six to 11 
years, the authority has reportedly 
neglected to collect its revenues from 
city merchants. 

Whether or not the Green Party \:vill 
find an elected voice in New Haven 
politics remains unknown, but it cer-
tainly made no advances in last 
:.d rj month's primary. Candidates favored 
by DiLieto's political action committee 
"Democrats for the Future" defeated 
four of the city's incumbent-and most 
independent- aldermen. Chuck Allen 
was one of them. He ran in the 
primary on both the Democratic and 
;:;reen Party tickets as a member of the 
newly formed Progressive Alliance, 
but he never expected to lose. Now he 
faces the choice of either running as a 
Green in No_vember or leaving the 
board. "We just couldn't match the 
organizational skill and fundraising of 
the machine," Allen says. 

"We" inCluded a number of Bill 
Jones supporters and Green Party 
members who decided last July to con-
1 solidate their forces and try to add in-
dependent aldermen to the board. All 
but one of their candidates were 
defeated; Toni Harp benefited in the 
Second Ward from support among 
Morse and Stiles students. The sweep

seemed to disturb everyone but the 
DiLieto administration. According to 
Allen, the primary had an impact in 
two ways. Not only d id the city lose in· 
dependent voices on the board, it lost 
independent wards, where voters d id 
not rely on aldermen backed by 
DiLieto to meet their needs. 


Ratner also felt "totally disheartened 
after the prirrtary," especially since he 
sees certain mechanisms in the board 
which make things worse. The ad· ,.. 
ministration, 
he says, 
consistently 
brings major projects and decisions to 
the board at the last minute, pressur-
ing 
representatives 
into hurrying 
through thick packets of material. 


Even the most independent aldermen, 
interested in 9uestioning the ad-
ministration, can work their way 
through only so much paperwork in 
the course of a few days. 


Yet R atner does not want to see the 
Green Party gain a substantial base on 
the board, nor does he think it can, 
even if M ichaelson wins the election. 
Ratner sees the Green Party as a group 
of "pernicious demagogues" who are 
often misinformed a nd 
unrealistic 
about New Haven. He does not think 
Michaelson has enough experience to 
single-handedly represent the Greens 
on the board. But so far, Michaelson '11 
T
appears 
well-informed about 
the 
party's platform on New H aven issues, 
and few would question his loyalty to 
the Greens' vision : at one debate, he 
consistently spoke of his political goals 
in terms of "we." 


Michaelson seriously questions the 
independence of most Democrats on 
the board. "In many ways, Joel was 
number 30 on a board of 30 alders. It 
took a year for him to be able to vote 
against the administration. You have 
to remember he was picked by the 
mayor. H e had his debts to pay, I 
think. Plus, the person who follows 
Joel is not going to be carrying forth 
the platform of J oel 
R atner ." " 


Michaelson 
believes 
he 
can 
win the election in Ward 1 precisely 
because of the independent nature of 
its constituency. "Yale students don't 
have any city patronage," he says. 
"People .are not embarrassed to vote 
against Democrats. I think the only 
way to win is to bring issues to the polls 
actively." 


According to Ratner, issues raised 
in the campaign do confront the board, 
at times in direct ways. Once, for ex-
ample, the Yale Psychiatric Institute 
hoped to expand by acquiring city 
land - thereby taking it off the city's 
taxroll. The board had to decide how 
Yale would compensate the city, taking 
~· 
~into account both the precedent its deci-
sion would establish and the city's long-
range goals. In the· end, Yale agreed, 
among other things, to include a tax-
able, first-floor commercial space, and 
to offer a training program for people 
from the H ill area to prepare them for 
work at YPI and similar institutions. 


When such crucial issues come up, 
Ratner says, they require the type of 
thoughtful preparation provided by the 
campaign. At least, that's one of the 
things they require. 


Ratner's choice not to seek reelection 
this year was personal- and 
anguishing. Not someone "who cah 
just move to a city and start there," he 
had considered making New Haven 
his permanent home but thought that 
..jle was too young for that decision. If 
he ran again, he felt it would be "so dif-
ficult to ever make a break, more dif-
ficult with every act I committed on the 
Board of Aldermen." So, somewhat 
ironically, he leaves New Haven this 
January because, for him, it was 
becoming too much of a home. And 
even more ironically, he plans to go to 
Thailand, to work for a development 
organization in a place where he has no 
connections, where he will in fact start 
over again. "I'm no less persuaded now 
that getting involved at every level is 
not just beneficial but critical," he says, 
revealing the same motivations that he 
had two years ago. "When things go 
wrong, really it makes me all the more 
inspired to go and change them. 
Maybe that's my own naivete."

The sounds of workers sbouting..ordwaisl~J.s

years, in an area known more for its 
poverty than for its retail possibilities. 
Although not a single hole has yet been 
dug, the project already faces problems 
balancing economic stimulus and com-
munity preservation. 

The Hill project will focus on the 
rehabilitation of Richard C. Lee High 
School, formerly the city's only voca-
tional secondary school. In the first 
"phase of development, a $70 million 
plan for the 10-acre area surrounding 
the high school will include the con-
struction of a 250-room first-class hotel 
as well as the conversion of Lee High 
into a conference center with retail and 
office space. The high school gym will 
become a health club. And at the ceo-
of the project, a two-and-a-half acre 
park will sit atop a parking 
..... r:;,.,, .. for about 1000 cars. 
choice to convert, rather than to 
demolish, Lee High reflects a lesson 
taught by its namesake, former New 
Haven mayor Richard Lee. Between 
1953 and 1969, Lee spearheaded wh~t 
politicians today call a pioneer 
in urban renewal, encour-
growth through projects such as 
Chapel Square Mall and Wooster 
Lee tore down and then 
many areas, displacing large 
aumt>ers of people and destroying the 
of their neighborhoods. Con-
struction of the Oak Street Connector, 
which links New Haven to Interstate 
91, displaced 881 families. Mayor 
Biagio DiLieto has taken a different 
approach, declaring a moratorium on 
demolition 
and 
emphasizing 
rehabilitation. 

In addition 
to a 
change 
m 
philosophy, limited finances have 
steered city development. Once treated 
as a model city and showered wit,h 
Practically unlimited subsidies to test 
the effects of government funding in 
Urban renewal, New Haven must now 
,.compete for federal grants. The most 
'tommon of these, the Urban Demand 
~d Action Grant (UDAG), gives ci-
ties money to loan to individual 
developers. Once the developers pay 
~k the money, the city can reinvest it 
111 other municipal programs. New 
Haven's past reputation as a focal point 
for urban revitalization seems to have 
served it well; the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development 
(HUD) has awarded the city nine 
UDAGs since 1980. New Haven has 
also turned to private developers, 
among them Yale University. Last 
May the University announced that it 
planned to invest $50 million in New 
Haven over the next five to ten years. 
Although David Swensen, Yale's direc-
tor of investments, would not speculate 
on how all of the $50 million will be 
spent, the University has committed 
part of the money to the Downtown 
South-Hill North development. 

New Haven officials are anxious to 
start the project, but their overzealous 
attempts have created some tension in 
the Hill. In February of 1986, DiLieto 
named the Schnip Development Cor-
poration of Norwich as preferred 
developer for the overall project. Con-
troversy arose when the city accepted 
company president John Schnip's 
$10.2 million bid on the school without 
opening up bidding to the public. 
Recalling a precedent set in 1982, a 
federal judge ruled that New Haven 
must open bidding. Schnip had ap-
plied for a $10 million UDAG to help 
finance the phase of the project in-
volving Lee High, but this ruling has 
stalled the UDAG application until 
January. By then, a New Haven ar-
chitect, Wendell Harp, intends to sub-
mit a competing plan and to make a 
bid. City officials say they expect 
Schnip to obtain the bid and even the 
UDAG. Meanwhile, the Hill waits-
but not quietly. 

Lee High closed in June of 1986, 
just four months after Schnip's pro-
posal was accepted. New Haven Board 
of Education officials say they had 
been planning for years to close Lee 
and relocate its students at Hillhouse 
and Wilbur Cross high schools. De-
clining enrollment and high main-
tenance costs, they say, prompted the 
move. The timing of the board's deci-
sion 
has 
upset some community 
members. Ron Boykin, a 1981 Lee 
graduate, feels that the city has made 
room for development at the expense 
of the neighborhood. Standing outside 
the modern 
school 
building, 
he 
watches a teenager riding a motorbike 
on the lawn. "Why did they close the 
school if they're not using it? First they 
told us it was going to be a technical 
school, now they say it's going to be a 
hotel for the train station. I don't know 
what's going to happen." 

Hill Alderman Tomas Reyes tries to 
bridge this information gap. He acts as 
intermediary between the city ad-
ministration and the community, and 
seems as comfortable in his BMW, 
equipped with a DiLieto bumper 
sticker, as he does drinking a beer at a 
local pizza place. He looks up from 
o,·er his Heineken and waves at some-
one walking by. "The neighborhood is 
saying, 'You're not going to forget us.'" 
Reyes coined the project term "Down-
town South-Hill North" in an attempt 
to focus attention on the Hill neigh-
borhood. "It was almost a joke. But 
after we realized that it stuck, it was 
more than a joke. It was a message. 
We consider this our land, our neigh-
borhood, so we're going to put our-
selves into the process," Reyes said. 

The Hill Development Corporation 
(HDC), formed by the merger of two 
other community development com-
mittees in 1980, consulted with Schnip 
and Yale-New Haven Medical Center 


--- Page 26 ---

in developing a master plan for the Hill 
area. The Schnip Corporation also 
held an open forum for community 
members to raise questions about the 
development. 

Like many Hill residents, AI Boyer 
fears the project may drive him from 
his home. "I'm worried that they're 
going to force out the people living 
here now, and bring in people with a 
lot of money." The Hill project will 
displace few residents, since most of 
the land is vacant. But development 
will increase real estate values and 
rents, exacerbating already severe pro-
blems of homelessness and low-income 
housing. "People are sleeping three 
families to an apartment," Reyes said. 
"Any empty apartment has a line of fif-
teen peop e waiting for it." 

The HDC confirms that the Hill suf-
fers from a housing shortage, with a 
vacancy rate of one-half of one percent 
in comparison with the average of five 
percent. Such high demand spurs 
higher rents, which must often be paid 
for out of a family's food money. Ac-
cording to a 1986 survey by the Con-
necticut Association for Human Ser-
vices, one quarter of the families in the 
Hill with children are chronically 
hungry. Reverend Karl Hilgert, ex-
ecutive director of a local support net-
work, blames past development policy 
for contributing to the Hill's current 
economic woes. "It hasn't been in the 
interest of poor people. Bricks and 
mortar, while they're good, are not 
really the emphases that need to oe 
made." He worries that Schnip will 
concentrate on the hotel and con-
ference center, 
especially since a 
source of funding for the residential 
phase of construction has not been 
found. "I'd like to see low-income hous-
ing done at least simultaneously with 
the first phases," he said. 

Reyes feels that the negative effects 
of the development are inevitable. "I 
want to bite the bullet. I want to look 
people in the face and say, 'Folks, there 
is going to be gentrification here. Yup-
pies are going to move in.' There are 
going to be poor people who are not 
going to ?e able to afford to live in the


26 The New Journal/October 16, 1987 

Hill. So we have to develop programs 
today for that eventuality." Reyes and 
the HDC have convinced Schnip to 
provide more than the 20 percent of 
low-to moderate-income housing re-
quired by HUD. Originally they asked 
for 40 percent of all housing in the 
$360 million project, and Schnip even-
tually agreed to 30 percent. After the 
UDAG portion of the project gets 
underway, the Schnip Corporation 
will build approximately 300 rental 
units partly for lower income tenants, 
48 condominiums, and two condomin-
ium buildings with about 145 mixed-
price units all together. 

Washington Center Associates 
some of the other things,'" he said. 
But Reyes thinks development has 
to involve compromise, especially in a 
city where homelessness and hunger 
can be found in virtually every 
neighborhood. "We feel, in the Hill, 
that we have more than our share of 
subsidized housing. We have the three 
emergency shelters for the homeless. 
We've got three major section eight 
projects, which charge lower rent. And •1 
we have a significant amount of rental ' 
rehabilitation housing. So we've done 
our share in building and planning for 
poor people." Instead of concentrating 
solely on low-income housing to the ex-
clusion of more upscale development, 
Reyes would like to see the new 
• development create job opportunities. 

j 
The current unemployment rate in 
• the neighborhood, according to the 
~ HDC, is about 15 percent, or three

:= percent above the average for the city. 
~ The Downtown South-Hill North 
::: development should provide about 650 
l permanent jobs and 250 temporary 
(WCA), a New Haven-based group 
made up of minority business people, 
will work with Schnip on much of the 
lower income housing. WCA has also 
been made preferred developer of a 
small part of the Hill project. There, 
they plan to build a retail and commer-
cial complex, including an Hispanic-
owned bank to serve the needs of a 
racially diverse community composed 
of 40 percent black, 30 percent 
Hispanic, 
30 percent white 
residents. Hilgert is skeptical about 
WCA's 
involvement. 
"Washington 
Center is good for the community. But 
it's also a bargaining chip-in other 
words, 'If you get this, you can wait for 

jobs in such fields as construction and 
security. And Schnip has agreed to 
consider HDC referrals first when hir-
ing people for these jobs. But many of 
the other businesses that development 
will attract won't need the Hill's many• 
poorly skilled workers. A second phase 
of the Hill development will include 
mainly office towers, most medical-
related. These offices promise a more 
affiuent, white-collar atmosphere in 
the Hill of the future. 

Reyes looks at his watch and quickly 
swallows the last of his beer. He taps 
his finger emphatically on the table. 
"We're going to have to do a balancing 
act in continuing to stimulate and in-
vite massive developments that will 
produce jobs and quality amenities for 
the neighborhood- and at the same 
time, in being compassionate and sen-
sitive to the coming displacement that I 
think is already happening. We're 
going to have to become magicians in-¥ 
the Hill."

Afterthought/Eric Schnapper 
Injudicious Planning 
On July 1, 1987, the Reagan Ad-
ministration faced what most observers 
thought was an interesting but hardly 
difficult task- to persuade the Senate 
to confirm Judge Robert Bork as an 
associate justice of the United States 
Supreme Court. The right wing views 
that had won Judge Bork the nomina-
tion, to be sure, had little public sup-
port. But the Administration evidently 
perceived no need to deal directly with 
the substance of Bork's ideas. For over 
six years President Reagan had suc-
ceeded beyond all reason in persuading 
Congress to approve measures which 
legislators believed made little sense. 
The White House began the Bork con-
firmation process confident that it 
could rely once more on the arsenal of 
tactics that had so often succeeded in 
the past. 

But 1987 was not 1981; the Presi-
dent's personal popularity was on the 
wane, and the Democrats had regained 
28 The New j ournal/October 16, 1987 
control of the Senate. Lobbying prac-
tices that had once sufficed largely 
because of the President's political 
dominance now had to stand on their 
own. After six years those practices 
had become so familiar and seemingly 
effective that the Administration was 
unable to perceive their inherent 
weaknesses; as the weeks went by, 
White House lobbyists shifted with in-
creasing haste from one tactic to 
another, never understanding why 
none were working and never coming 
to grips with the substantive problems 
posed 
by Judge 
Bork's record. 

Towards the end some conservatives 
would criticize the White House for 
not lobbying harder on Judge Bork's 
behalf. But the nomination failed, not 
because the White House did too little, 
but because the White House did 
precisely the sorts of things it had done 
in the past, learning too late that those 
approaches were ineffective and at the
•• 
time counterproductive. 

The marketing of Judge Bork; 
opened with the boldest of White 
House arguments, that the Senate had 
no business even considering Judge 
Bork's "philosophy," i.e., that the 
Senate was required to ignore what 
Bork had said he would do if he were 
on the Supreme Court. This was a 
natural argument for an Administra-
tion whose expansive views of ex-
ecutive authority rivaled the territorial 
ambitions of Czarist Russia. Just as 
the White House had long sought to 
circumscribe the role of Congress in 
foreign policy, so too the White House 
was attracted to a doctrine that would 
have eviscerated the advise and con-
sent function of the Senate. 

Most of July was consumed arguing;" 
unsuccessfully that the Senate could 
not consider the ideology of a judicial 
nominee. But the White House posi-
tion quickly ran into a series of fatal

diversionary arguments. The White 
House, conservative senators, and 
witnesses 
including former Chief 
Justice Warren Burger insisted that 
" Judge Bork's record had been dis· 
torted. The charges of distortion, 
however, were rarely accompanied by 
any explanations of which allegation 
regarding Judge Bork's record was in-
accurate. The President appeared at a 
California meeting to once again assert 
that Bork would be a law-and-order 
justice, but to little avail. As the situa-
tion deteriorated, Mr. Reagan, who 
had run for president on a platform 
that expressly called for an ideological 
test for nominees, asserted that rejec-
tion of Judge Bork on account of his 
ideology would be a grave threat to the 
independence of the .federal courts. 
That argument, from a man who haa 
made a career out of denouncing the 
Supreme Court, was greeted with a 
justified degree of incredulity. 

In retrospect, Robert Bork may 
never have been confirmable, his 
judicial views too far to the right to sur-
vive any serious public scrutiny. But 
the Administration's own efforts to sell 
Bork to the Senate and to the Ameri 
can people turned a probable defeat in-
to a certain debacle. Over six years in 
office the President and his advisors 
had grown too accustomed to selling 
legislative proposals with blue smoke 
and mirrors, and too arrogant to treat 
the Congress and the public as a 
legitimate part of the democratic pro-
