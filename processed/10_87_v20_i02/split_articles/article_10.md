Just mention his name. 
"A one-man academic hit squad," 
sneers Fareed Zakaria (BK '85) in The 
New Republic. Last December, the 
magazine Science appointed him "sheriff 
of scholarship." While Yale anthropologist Leopold Pospisil admires him, 
a Yale political scientist calls him "a 
jerk." Sterling Professor of Economics 
James Tobin, a Nobel Prize winner, 
says that "the last thing" he wants to do 
is to get into an argument with him. 
The chairman of the mathematics 
department declares him to be one of 
the most dedicated teachers at Yale. 
His students describe 
him as 
everything from "well-organized" to 
"confrontational" to "awful." 

Behind a cluttered desk, the conflicting images of Serge Lang- mathematician, professor, and member of 
the National Academy of Sciences 
(NAS)- fuse in the form of a small, 
wiry, nervously energetic man. Proud 
of making enemies, Lang thrives on 
confrontation; he seems as eager to 
raise hackles as he does to raise issues. 
In the latest of his series of academic 
8 The New Journal/October 16, 1987 
disputes, Lang is waging a campaign 
to prevent the election of a prominent 
Harvard political scientist, Samuel P. 
Huntington OE '46), to the NAS. 
When asked about his motivations, 
Lang erupts. "I don't want to live in a 
society which indoctrinates the young! 
... I don't indoctrinate the young; I 
teach them. I follow the rhetoric of the 
president of the University. It is they 
who don't! . . . It isn't for me to answer 
why I live by the rhetoric of freshman 
addresses. It is for them to answer why 
they do not!" 

Born in Paris in 1927, Lang immigrated with his parents to California 
13 years later. At 18, Lang earned 
his B.S. in physics at the California 
Institute of Technology. After a year 
and a half in the United States Army, 
he returned to academia to study 
philosophy at Princeton, switching to 
mathematics a year later. In 1951 he 
received his Ph.D. in mathematics. 
Rapidly ascending the academic ladder, Lang in 1955 became a professor 
at Columbia, where he stayed until 
1970. Hopping from Columbia to 
Princeton to Harvard, Lang landed at 
Yale in 1972 as a full professor, and 
has remained here since then. 

As a professor, Lang, who teaches 
both 
introductory and advanced 
classes, has drawn mixed reviews. According to his students, he is a demanding teacher who fires questions at 
them during class. Some students find 
his confrontational style stimulating. 
"Fifty minutes of math is not an easy 
way to spend one's time, but Lang kept 
it interesting by keeping the students 
involved," says Harry Robinson (DC 
'89), who took one of Lang's calculus 
courses during first semester of his 
freshman year. Robinson recalls that 
Lang's typical response to a question 
was: "You tell me the answer." Lang 
makes the questioner work through 
each step of the problem to ensure that 
they will understand. 

But other students criticize Lang for 
his impatience and for not thoroughly 
presenting the material. "You had to 
be a math whiz to understand him, as 
opposed to someone trying to learn 
math," says Colin Goldman (BK '90). 


Students say that the textbook for 
Mathematics 120, written by Lang, 
duplicated the material in the lectures. 
As a result, Goldman says, there was 
"nothing to fall back on." Many 
students feel that the text presented too 
few drills and examples. This year the 
mathematics department 
replaced 
Lang's text for three levels of introductory calculus classes. According 
to Ronald Coifman, the department's 
chairman, "We usually rotate books 
every few years." 

Despite 
his intense teaching 
schedule, Lang has not devoted his 
career wholly to academics. In 1966 he 
discovered his second "passion," 
politics. During a year's sabbatical at 
University of California, Berkeley, he 
wrote three or four advertisements for 
Democrat Robert Scheer's congressional campaign. Though Scheer, an 
early opponent of the Vietnam War, 
lost with 45 percent of the vote, Lang 
continued his political involvement 
when 
he returned 
to Columbia 
University that fall. In his book Rats in 
a Box (1970), 
which describes 
American society's reaction to the war, 
Lang writes that he mediated between 
the administration and the students 
over campus anti-war activity. 

Academia prevailed in the end, 
however. In 1970, Lang felt that his 
political involvement had become too 
consuming. "It would have killed me as 
a mathematician, so I put an abrupt 
stop to it," Lang says firmly. "But now 
I'm in pretty good control. Although it 
certainly detracts from the time I could 
give to researching mathematics, it 
does not kill it. And I still write and 
research papers." In the classroom, 
at times Lang combines his politics and his 
teaching, distributing material related 
to his causes. Goldman complained 
that "I didn't understand his math, and 
I didn't like him wasting time talking 
about letters to the NAS and the Harvard man he was trying to kick out." 

A stark corner office on the first floor 
of Leet Oliver Memorial Hall has 
served as Lang's headquarters in his 
battle against "the Harvard man," 
Samuel Huntington. There are no 
posters on the walls, no photographs 
on the desk. Five metal file cabinets 
two bookcases contain the 
evidence of Lang's furious career, 
which has yielded 32 mathematics 
books and 72 articles. From behind his 
metal desk covered with exam papers, 
a telephone, and a typewriter, Lang 
fires off his denunciations. Speaking 
quickly with a distinct accent, he 
declares, "What I have shown is the extent to which what Huntington peddles 
is, in fact, political and represents 
political opinions. His book (Political 
Order in Changing Societies) is a tissue of 
political opinions passed off as 
science." Huntington's work, Lang 
argues, is not sufficiently scientific to 
qualify him for membership in the 
NAS. 

Founded in 1863, the NAS is a 
prestigious organization with 1,523 
members that advises the federal 
government on scientific matters 
through its National Research Council. Election to the NAS is considered 
among the highest of American scientific awards. In 1986 Huntington's 
election seemed secure, several NAS 
members say. Huntington had impressive credentials. The director of 
Harvard's Center for International 
Relations, at that time he was president 
of the American Political Science 
Association and had advised the State 
Department, the Defense Department, 
and the National Security Council. 

Challenges in the Academy are rare, 
according to NAS member Jared Diamond, in an August 1987 essay in 
Discover magazine. Diamond writes 
that there have been only two in the 
eight years since his election to the 
Academy. 

For his part, Lang, a 
member of the NAS for only one year, 
seemed an improbable challenger. His 
field, pure mathematics, is remote 
from the social sciences in which Huntington works. Nevertheless, Lang attacked. 

In March 1986, Lang received the 
first NAS ballot since his election to the 
He 
recognized Huntington's name from an article written 
by mathematician Neal Koblitz. In the 
article, Koblitz, who had supported 
Lang in a previous academic dispute, 
dismissed 
Huntington's use of 
mathematics in 
his 
textbook as 
"mystification, 
intimidation." 
Lang spent "three or four hours" 
reading sections of Political Order in 
Changing Societies, focusing on the sections cited by Koblitz. He then wrote
