It certainly differs from the standard 
donation by an Old Blue benefactor. 
Instead of in a check barely large 
enough to fit the zeroes, this gift, from 
a San Francisco usher, comes in 
disks-lots of them. Bob Kellman, an 
enthusiastic musical theater fan, 
recently donated one of the most 
extensive 
individual 
collections of 
musical theater LPs to the Yale 
Collection of Historical Sound 
Recordings (HSR). 

Since 1962, Kellman has collected 
what he calls "probably anything that's 
been recorded that is in any way 
connected with a musical." He has 
accumulated some 1500 records, many 
of which are autographed, and almost 
as many stories. Performers like Ethel 
Merman and Liza Minnelli have con-
fided private memories to Kellman, he 
says. In fact, Minnelli has commis-
sioned copies of rare recordings from 
him. 

From his association 
with per-
formers, Kellman learned of Yale's 
recordings archive. "I 
decided to 
donate my collection back in 1981," he 
says. "I was involved in the theater by 
being a stage doorman at the Golden 
Gate Theater, and I happened to know 
Gwen Verdon from my interest in 
theater and seeing shows. I spoke to 
her and said I happened to have one of 
the most complete collections of musi-
cal theater recordings on the West 
Coast, and she gave me a list of about a 
half a dozen places that might be in-
terested. I wrote to all of them and the 
response I got from Yale was what 
persuaded me to give it to them." 

Kellman visited HSR and met with 
the curator, Richard Warren (BK '59), 
that year. He originally intended to 
wait until after his death to send the 
collection but changed his mind aft~r 
the AIDS epidemic hit San Francisco 
full force. "I'm a gay man, and I have 
lost a lot of friends to AIDS," he 
explains. "I'm under the suspicion that 
I might get it, so I decided to ship the 
collection off while I was still alive." He 
started to send batches of his records 
last year. 

According to Warren, the donation

has already helped some people in 
research. 
Last semester a college 
semi~ar entitled "Stephen Sondheim 
and the American Musical Theater 
Tradition". used a tape with musicals 
taken from Kellman's contribution. 
When Warren could not locate one · 
album, he called Kellman, who pro-
vided it from his private collection. 
Eventually he or his estate will "send off 
the rest of his music, Kellman says, 
including the rest of the records, some 
books, and a number of cassette and 
reel-to-reel tapes. 

While organizing his works, Kell-
man includes memories or tales he 
knows about particular musicals, 
stories which music lovers and even the 
performers 
themselves 
might 
not 
know. For example, South Pacific fans 
can learn from Kellman that the show's 
star, Mary Martin, appeared on stage 
at Yale in 1938. Honoring the wishes 
of a few of the greats, he says, he has 
kept some secrets to himself. 

Finding HSR takes a little detective 
work. Tucked away past the payroll 
department on the second floor of 
Sterling, the archive does not exactly 
bustle with activity. 
But inside, 
thousands of records crowd the book-
shelves: 78's mixed in with 33's, Bach 
within range of "The Wizard of Oz." 
And, somewhere within the musical 
jumble, a 
record autographed by 
Gwen Verdon, bearing the inscription 
"For Yale."
