about the United States, and they 
flung them at me rapidly. I began to 
answer in stumbling Russian, and 
within minutes, a crowd had gathered 
around to listen. The questions started 
coming faster as I struggled to comprehend and answer. My American 
friends, Laslo and Michele, came up to 
help field the barrage of courteous but 
persistent questions. 
"Do you believe in God?" This from 
my first interlocutor. Explaining the 
idea of human spirit and a transcendent deity in Russian is no picnic, but 
the six or more people who had 
gathered to listen seemed to understand my words. Though I wondered 
for a minute if they thought I was 
crazy, their attention and respect 
reassured me that I was making sense. 
I finished with the God question and 
they threw me another- How much is 
a color television in America? A bit of 
a switch, I thought, but they waited for 
my answer with equal gravity. I said I 
had never shopped for a television,.but 
I estimated a starting cost of $300. I 
converted the price into rubles, a 
figure representing about three months' salary for the average Soviet. A 
polite middle-aged man followed up: 
How would you get the television 
home from the store? I thought the 
man had to be joking and looked at my 
audience, but it waited eagerly for my 
answer. Somewhat embarrassed, I said 
I'd probably use my car. That sent a 
charge through the crowd; few Soviets 
have cars, and as my audience looked 
at me with wonder I shuffled uneasily. 
Pursuing the strangely popular topic 
of the television purchase, the same 
man asked me how I would get the TV 
into my apartment. I replied sheepishly that my family owned its own 
home, which caused a bigger stir in my 
audience than the mention of the car. 
Moscow apartments rarely exceed 
three rooms. I told him my mother or 
father would probably help me carry 
the TV into the house. My audience 
nodded with interest. I puzzled over its 
fascination with this mundane topic, 
but then I thought of the seemingly inane questions I had asked Muscovites 
about trivial aspects of their daily lives. 
The middle-aged man wanted to 
confirm rumors he'd 
heard that 
America had both stores and television 
stations which operated 24 hours a 
day. I said it was true. He then wanted 
to know who paid for so much television. I asked the group if it understood 
the concept of advertising, 
and 
everyone looked confused. Explaining 
that if I wanted to produce a television 
show, I would need someone to sponsor 
it, I said that I might engage the financial support of a company like Coca-
Cola (a name the Soviets recognized), 
and let it use five minutes for advertisements. What kind of advertisement 
would this be? they asked. Well, I 
replied, you just get people to run 
around and sing, and I sang them the 
"It's the real thing" jingle. They 
laughed and said they understood. 
After an hour of this my friends and 
I were exhausted. We started to leave, 
pausing to arrange a future meeting 
with Larissa and Marina, two students 
from an economics institute who had 
quizzed Michele about American music. During this exchange, a young 
man interrupted and asked us to sign 
his souvenir program of "America." 
Embarrassed, we demurred, but he insisted. I signed one and looked up to 
find that, Soviet-style, a line had 
formed behind him. No one wanted to 
miss out. 
Feeling ridiculous, 
my 
friends and I wrote "vcevo dobrovo" 
(all the best) and signed our names in 
English. We shook hands and walked 
out of the building into the bright 
sunlight. 

For several days following our adventure, Michele and I worried that the 
Soviets had felt cowed by the demonstration of American prosperity. As we 
rode the metro to the dorm of the 
economics institute, we wondered if 
our new acquaintances would treat us 
with awkward deference. Instead the 
two women turned our perceptions upside down. 

They took Michele and me to a 
cafe/disco where we ate ham and cheese 
pizza and drank cognac through 
straws, in celebration of Larissa's last 
exam. When we left, Larissa showed 
the effects of her brandy as she linked 
arms with us and marched boldly 
down the sidewalk, recalling phrases 
from English class and pronouncing 
them with the stilted British accent she 
learned in school. Caught up in 
Larissa's frivolity, Michele glanced up 
at one of the ubiquitous Soviet banners 
and pronounced in solemn Russian, 
"We Are Building 
Communism!" 

Larissa started and asked eagerly, 
"You are?" 

Michele laughed and tried tactfully 
to explain that she'd simply repeated 
the words of the banner, but Larissa 
did not listen. With glowing excitement, she recalled the bounty she had 
witnessed at the exhibit. "Your production has reached an optimum level," 
she said happily. "You are at the ideal 
stage for revolution."
