years, in an area known more for its 
poverty than for its retail possibilities. 
Although not a single hole has yet been 
dug, the project already faces problems 
balancing economic stimulus and com-
munity preservation. 

The Hill project will focus on the 
rehabilitation of Richard C. Lee High 
School, formerly the city's only voca-
tional secondary school. In the first 
"phase of development, a $70 million 
plan for the 10-acre area surrounding 
the high school will include the con-
struction of a 250-room first-class hotel 
as well as the conversion of Lee High 
into a conference center with retail and 
office space. The high school gym will 
become a health club. And at the ceo-
of the project, a two-and-a-half acre 
park will sit atop a parking 
..... r:;,.,, .. for about 1000 cars. 
choice to convert, rather than to 
demolish, Lee High reflects a lesson 
taught by its namesake, former New 
Haven mayor Richard Lee. Between 
1953 and 1969, Lee spearheaded wh~t 
politicians today call a pioneer 
in urban renewal, encour-
growth through projects such as 
Chapel Square Mall and Wooster 
Lee tore down and then 
many areas, displacing large 
aumt>ers of people and destroying the 
of their neighborhoods. Con-
struction of the Oak Street Connector, 
which links New Haven to Interstate 
91, displaced 881 families. Mayor 
Biagio DiLieto has taken a different 
approach, declaring a moratorium on 
demolition 
and 
emphasizing 
rehabilitation. 

In addition 
to a 
change 
m 
philosophy, limited finances have 
steered city development. Once treated 
as a model city and showered wit,h 
Practically unlimited subsidies to test 
the effects of government funding in 
Urban renewal, New Haven must now 
,.compete for federal grants. The most 
'tommon of these, the Urban Demand 
~d Action Grant (UDAG), gives ci-
ties money to loan to individual 
developers. Once the developers pay 
~k the money, the city can reinvest it 
111 other municipal programs. New 
Haven's past reputation as a focal point 
for urban revitalization seems to have 
served it well; the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development 
(HUD) has awarded the city nine 
UDAGs since 1980. New Haven has 
also turned to private developers, 
among them Yale University. Last 
May the University announced that it 
planned to invest $50 million in New 
Haven over the next five to ten years. 
Although David Swensen, Yale's direc-
tor of investments, would not speculate 
on how all of the $50 million will be 
spent, the University has committed 
part of the money to the Downtown 
South-Hill North development. 

New Haven officials are anxious to 
start the project, but their overzealous 
attempts have created some tension in 
the Hill. In February of 1986, DiLieto 
named the Schnip Development Cor-
poration of Norwich as preferred 
developer for the overall project. Con-
troversy arose when the city accepted 
company president John Schnip's 
$10.2 million bid on the school without 
opening up bidding to the public. 
Recalling a precedent set in 1982, a 
federal judge ruled that New Haven 
must open bidding. Schnip had ap-
plied for a $10 million UDAG to help 
finance the phase of the project in-
volving Lee High, but this ruling has 
stalled the UDAG application until 
January. By then, a New Haven ar-
chitect, Wendell Harp, intends to sub-
mit a competing plan and to make a 
bid. City officials say they expect 
Schnip to obtain the bid and even the 
UDAG. Meanwhile, the Hill waits-
but not quietly. 

Lee High closed in June of 1986, 
just four months after Schnip's pro-
posal was accepted. New Haven Board 
of Education officials say they had 
been planning for years to close Lee 
and relocate its students at Hillhouse 
and Wilbur Cross high schools. De-
clining enrollment and high main-
tenance costs, they say, prompted the 
move. The timing of the board's deci-
sion 
has 
upset some community 
members. Ron Boykin, a 1981 Lee 
graduate, feels that the city has made 
room for development at the expense 
of the neighborhood. Standing outside 
the modern 
school 
building, 
he 
watches a teenager riding a motorbike 
on the lawn. "Why did they close the 
school if they're not using it? First they 
told us it was going to be a technical 
school, now they say it's going to be a 
hotel for the train station. I don't know 
what's going to happen." 

Hill Alderman Tomas Reyes tries to 
bridge this information gap. He acts as 
intermediary between the city ad-
ministration and the community, and 
seems as comfortable in his BMW, 
equipped with a DiLieto bumper 
sticker, as he does drinking a beer at a 
local pizza place. He looks up from 
o,·er his Heineken and waves at some-
one walking by. "The neighborhood is 
saying, 'You're not going to forget us.'" 
Reyes coined the project term "Down-
town South-Hill North" in an attempt 
to focus attention on the Hill neigh-
borhood. "It was almost a joke. But 
after we realized that it stuck, it was 
more than a joke. It was a message. 
We consider this our land, our neigh-
borhood, so we're going to put our-
selves into the process," Reyes said. 

The Hill Development Corporation 
(HDC), formed by the merger of two 
other community development com-
mittees in 1980, consulted with Schnip 
and Yale-New Haven Medical Center

in developing a master plan for the Hill 
area. The Schnip Corporation also 
held an open forum for community 
members to raise questions about the 
development. 

Like many Hill residents, AI Boyer 
fears the project may drive him from 
his home. "I'm worried that they're 
going to force out the people living 
here now, and bring in people with a 
lot of money." The Hill project will 
displace few residents, since most of 
the land is vacant. But development 
will increase real estate values and 
rents, exacerbating already severe pro-
blems of homelessness and low-income 
housing. "People are sleeping three 
families to an apartment," Reyes said. 
"Any empty apartment has a line of fif-
teen peop e waiting for it." 

The HDC confirms that the Hill suf-
fers from a housing shortage, with a 
vacancy rate of one-half of one percent 
in comparison with the average of five 
percent. Such high demand spurs 
higher rents, which must often be paid 
for out of a family's food money. Ac-
cording to a 1986 survey by the Con-
necticut Association for Human Ser-
vices, one quarter of the families in the 
Hill with children are chronically 
hungry. Reverend Karl Hilgert, ex-
ecutive director of a local support net-
work, blames past development policy 
for contributing to the Hill's current 
economic woes. "It hasn't been in the 
interest of poor people. Bricks and 
mortar, while they're good, are not 
really the emphases that need to oe 
made." He worries that Schnip will 
concentrate on the hotel and con-
ference center, 
especially since a 
source of funding for the residential 
phase of construction has not been 
found. "I'd like to see low-income hous-
ing done at least simultaneously with 
the first phases," he said. 

Reyes feels that the negative effects 
of the development are inevitable. "I 
want to bite the bullet. I want to look 
people in the face and say, 'Folks, there 
is going to be gentrification here. Yup-
pies are going to move in.' There are 
going to be poor people who are not 
going to ?e able to afford to live in the

Hill. So we have to develop programs 
today for that eventuality." Reyes and 
the HDC have convinced Schnip to 
provide more than the 20 percent of 
low-to moderate-income housing re-
quired by HUD. Originally they asked 
for 40 percent of all housing in the 
$360 million project, and Schnip even-
tually agreed to 30 percent. After the 
UDAG portion of the project gets 
underway, the Schnip Corporation 
will build approximately 300 rental 
units partly for lower income tenants, 
48 condominiums, and two condomin-
ium buildings with about 145 mixed-
price units all together.

some of the other things,'" he said. 
But Reyes thinks development has 
to involve compromise, especially in a 
city where homelessness and hunger 
can be found in virtually every 
neighborhood. "We feel, in the Hill, 
that we have more than our share of 
subsidized housing. We have the three 
emergency shelters for the homeless. 
We've got three major section eight 
projects, which charge lower rent. And •1 
we have a significant amount of rental ' 
rehabilitation housing. So we've done 
our share in building and planning for 
poor people." Instead of concentrating 
solely on low-income housing to the ex-
clusion of more upscale development, 
Reyes would like to see the new 
• development create job opportunities.

The current unemployment rate in 
• the neighborhood, according to the 
~ HDC, is about 15 percent, or three 
• 
:= percent above the average for the city. 
~ The Downtown South-Hill North 
::: development should provide about 650 
l permanent jobs and 250 temporary 
(WCA), a New Haven-based group 
made up of minority business people, 
will work with Schnip on much of the 
lower income housing. WCA has also 
been made preferred developer of a 
small part of the Hill project. There, 
they plan to build a retail and commer-
cial complex, including an Hispanic-
owned bank to serve the needs of a 
racially diverse community composed 
of 40 percent black, 30 percent 
Hispanic, 
30 percent white 
residents. Hilgert is skeptical about 
WCA's 
involvement. 
"Washington 
Center is good for the community. But 
it's also a bargaining chip-in other 
words, 'If you get this, you can wait for 

jobs in such fields as construction and 
security. And Schnip has agreed to 
consider HDC referrals first when hir-
ing people for these jobs. But many of 
the other businesses that development 
will attract won't need the Hill's many• 
poorly skilled workers. A second phase 
of the Hill development will include 
mainly office towers, most medical-
related. These offices promise a more 
affiuent, white-collar atmosphere in 
the Hill of the future. 

Reyes looks at his watch and quickly 
swallows the last of his beer. He taps 
his finger emphatically on the table. 
"We're going to have to do a balancing 
act in continuing to stimulate and in-
vite massive developments that will 
produce jobs and quality amenities for 
the neighborhood- and at the same 
time, in being compassionate and sen-
sitive to the coming displacement that I 
think is already happening. We're 
going to have to become magicians in-¥ 
the Hill."
