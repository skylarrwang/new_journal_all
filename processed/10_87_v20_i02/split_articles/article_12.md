them for a survey whose questions he 
considered 
prejudiced 
and 
unanswerable. In a statement included 
in The File, Lipset and Ladd responded 
that "Prof. Lang charges us with a 
failure to resolve each and every am-
biguity. It may be that Prof. Lang, un-
trained in the social sciences, is simply 
misinformed about the nature of social 
research." 


In both the Ladd-Lipset and Hun-
tington cases, Lang, a hard scientist, 
criticized the standards of soft scien-
tists. When he first looked into Hun-
tington's work, Lang predicted that the 
fight would resemble his earlier one 
against the two sociologists. With the 
same flurry of vitriolic correspondence 
"I don't want to live in 
a society which 
indoctrinates the 
young!" 
with which he brought Ladd and 
Lipset before the public eye, he 
turned the secretive National Academy 
of Sciences into a public battlefield. 


Lang's evidence consists only of a 
tiny portion of Huntington's work-a 
few 
pages each from two books and 
two articles. He says that by insisting 
that he read more of Huntington's 
work, his critics are simply trying to 
protect themselves. When asked how 
he could justify an attack based on 
such limited evidence, Lang reacts 
angrily, striking the desk with his 
hand. "The question is not the page 
count. The question is the significance 
of what I pick!" Lang argues that he 
needed to find only a few important 
flaws to justify his attack. 


He claims he found them. In Hun-
tington's widely-used textbook, Political 
Order in Changing Societies, Lang singles 
out a page on which Huntington em-
ploys mathematical formulae to ex-
press social circumstances. The article 
he submitted to PS quotes Koblitz's at-
tack on Huntington's book. Koblitz 
argues that the equations, such as 
"Social mobilization/economic devel-
opment = social frustration," result 
in a false "impression of precision and 
profundity." And he objects to Hun-
tington's correlating terms like 
"frustration" and "instability" and com-
ing up with a precise number: ".50." 


Huntington 
protests in 
The 
New 
Republic that he does not intend his 
equations to 
be mathematically 
rigorous. "They are meant to be a 
shorthand method to sum up a com-
plicated argument that I do detail," he 
says. Several political scientists say 
that 
Huntington rarely uses 
mathematics. 


Lang also criticizes the 1966 survey 
which Huntington uses in his textbook 
to characterize South Africa as a 
"satisfied society." Conducted by Ivo 
K. and Rosalind L. Feierabend, the 
survey 
won an award 
from 
the 
American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science when it was 
published. Lang says the six "satisfac-
tion" indices, including radios and 
telephones, on which the Feierabends 
based their assessment "failed spec-
tacularly to take into account what is 
important to 20 million blacks." To in-
validate the survey's conclusion, Lang 
has prepared a collage of 61 New York 
Times articles which report strikes and 
riots in South Africa between 1951 and 
1960, when the Feierabends were con-
ducting their survey. 


When asked about Lang's attack on 
Huntington's work, Yale professors in 
fields related to the dispute give varied 
responses. 


None entirely discount 
Lang's objections, and none give an 
unqualified endorsement of Hun-
tington's work. According to George 
Mostow, a mathematics professor and 
a member of the NAS, "The attack on 
Huntington could be seen by impartial 
observers as being too narrowly based. 
. . . However, as the evaluation of 
Huntington's papers progressed, it was 
not just mistakes of exposition but 
mistakes of substance. He ignored in-
formation freely available in the pages 
of The New York Times." Though some 
political 
scientists feel 
that Hun-
tington's work is flawed, they all seem 
to regard Lang's attack as an indict-
ment of their field itself. Professor 
David Mayhew says that Huntington 
is "one of the finest political scientists, 
widely thought to be such . . . . Lang 
is making a category mistake by sup-
posing that scholarship in political 
science is as innocent of what he 
would think is opinion, as what is in 
mathematics . . . . By Lang's stan-
dards, political science as a whole is not 
scientific enough to warrant inclusion 
in the NAS." 


The NAS itself fails to resolve the 
question of standards. The Academy 
solicits nominations by asking 
members to submit names of scientists 
"worthy of being proposed for nomina-
tion .... "A spokesperson for the NAS 
said that the candidates should be 
"outstanding" and "have achieved 
scientific recognition in their field." 
Apparently, the members must exer-
cise their own discretion to define 
"outstanding" and "scientific." 


The Huntington conflict spilled over 
onto the Yale campus last spring. As a 
student in H. Bradford Westerfield's 
class, "Introduction to International 
Relations," Joshua Katz (BR '89) 
found that he was required to read 
Huntington's Political Order in Changing 
Societies. While taking Lang's introduc-
tory calculus class in the fall, Katz had 
received a copy of Koblitz's article 
criticizing the book. "I took home the 
material, read it, believed what (saw, 
and decided that it was something I 
really believed in," he says. After com-
pleting Lang's course, Katz asked 
Lang how he could get involved. "He 
said to write 
a 
letter to Science 
magazine." Without having read the 
textbook, Katz did just that. 


It was Lang's idea, says Katz, to 
distribute copies of the letter, still un-
published, in Westerfield's class. "I was 
about to dump the copies of the letter 
on a table and leave them there, but 
said, "Wait a minute, I better ask 
Westerfield's opinion," Katz recalls. 
When Katz asked Westerfield, "He 
Professor H. Bradford Westerfield
believes in Samuel Huntington. 
requested that I not do that. He said that 
my letter would 'take too much TA 
preparation and would take time away 
substance 
of 
book." Westerfield later wrote to Katz 
and met with him. Westerfield refuses 
to discuss either communication. 


Westerfield explains that he did not 
prevent but rather "discouraged" Katz 
from passing out his letter. "I didn't 
consider the concerns in that letter cen-
tral to the particular concerns of my 
course. I 
didn't want to distract 
students from these particular concerns 
by raising other concerns that might be 
important in their own right but 
weren't central to my course." 


Without mentioning his relationship 
to Katz, Lang describes the incident in 
the article he submitted to PS. He also 
quotes from a letter that Westerfield 
sent him which the political scientist 
calls "a handwritten, private letter." 


Lang writes that Westerfield's letter 
"merely asserted that Huntington was 
President of the American Political 
Science Association. That fact plus his 
life-long familiarity with [Huntington] 
and his works was enough for him!" 


When asked about the contents of 
the letter, Westerfield declines to com-
ment. "It was a private letter to him," 
he says. "I had no expectation that he 
would publicize it . . . . I don't intend 
to carry on an argument with Serge 
Lang in public. Nor do I want to carry 
on any argument with Serge Lang." 


Westerfield, who studied with Hun-

tington first at Yale and then in a 
graduate program at Harvard, argues 
that having served as president of the 
American Political Science Association 
makes Huntington "by definition" an 
outstanding political scientist. 


Westerfield charges, "Lang is trying 
to tell me how to teach my course. 
Academic freedom says I can teach my 
course as I want to teach my course 
and assign the books I want to assign, 
and I don't have to answer to anybody 
about that . . . anybody except my 
own students." 


According to Lang, professors like 
Westerfield cause our educational 
system to turn out uncritical minds. 
"Lang is trying to tell 
me how to teach my 
course. Academic 
freedom says I can 
teach my course as I 
want to . . . " 


"Students are untrained to tell the dif-
ference between opinion and fact. On 
the contrary, they are trained to accept 
everything as a fact, including that 
South Africa is a satisfied society," he 
says. "And when the readers are skep-
tical enough, like Joshua Katz, they 
are shut up by Westerfield." 


For Lang, Katz's experience with 
Westerfield reflects the issues raised by 
the Huntington conflict. Both Wester-
field and the NAS cite authority and 
stress "collegiality" rather than answer-
ing legitimate criticism. By attacking 
Huntington, Lang hopes to shake up 
the academic community so that it 
becomes more critical towards its own. 


"It comes to the point that neither the 
professors nor the students can tell the 
difference between a fact, a perception 
of a fact, an opinion, and what is 
neither. I would like people trained so 
they can tell the difference."
