seemed to disturb everyone but the 
DiLieto administration. According to 
Allen, the primary had an impact in 
two ways. Not only d id the city lose in路 
dependent voices on the board, it lost 
independent wards, where voters d id 
not rely on aldermen backed by 
DiLieto to meet their needs. 


Ratner also felt "totally disheartened 
after the prirrtary," especially since he 
sees certain mechanisms in the board 
which make things worse. The ad路 ,.. 
ministration, 
he says, 
consistently 
brings major projects and decisions to 
the board at the last minute, pressur-
ing 
representatives 
into hurrying 
through thick packets of material. 


Even the most independent aldermen, 
interested in 9uestioning the ad-
ministration, can work their way 
through only so much paperwork in 
the course of a few days. 


Yet R atner does not want to see the 
Green Party gain a substantial base on 
the board, nor does he think it can, 
even if M ichaelson wins the election. 
Ratner sees the Green Party as a group 
of "pernicious demagogues" who are 
often misinformed a nd 
unrealistic 
about New Haven. He does not think 
Michaelson has enough experience to 
single-handedly represent the Greens 
on the board. But so far, Michaelson '11 
T
appears 
well-informed about 
the 
party's platform on New H aven issues, 
and few would question his loyalty to 
the Greens' vision : at one debate, he 
consistently spoke of his political goals 
in terms of "we." 


Michaelson seriously questions the 
independence of most Democrats on 
the board. "In many ways, Joel was 
number 30 on a board of 30 alders. It 
took a year for him to be able to vote 
against the administration. You have 
to remember he was picked by the 
mayor. H e had his debts to pay, I 
think. Plus, the person who follows 
Joel is not going to be carrying forth 
the platform of J oel 
R atner ." " 


Michaelson 
believes 
he 
can 
win the election in Ward 1 precisely 
because of the independent nature of 
its constituency. "Yale students don't 
have any city patronage," he says. 
"People .are not embarrassed to vote 
against Democrats. I think the only 
way to win is to bring issues to the polls 
actively." 


According to Ratner, issues raised 
in the campaign do confront the board, 
at times in direct ways. Once, for ex-
ample, the Yale Psychiatric Institute 
hoped to expand by acquiring city 
land - thereby taking it off the city's 
taxroll. The board had to decide how 
Yale would compensate the city, taking 
~路 
~into account both the precedent its deci-
sion would establish and the city's long-
range goals. In the路 end, Yale agreed, 
among other things, to include a tax-
able, first-floor commercial space, and 
to offer a training program for people 
from the H ill area to prepare them for 
work at YPI and similar institutions. 


When such crucial issues come up, 
Ratner says, they require the type of 
thoughtful preparation provided by the 
campaign. At least, that's one of the 
things they require. 


Ratner's choice not to seek reelection 
this year was personal- and 
anguishing. Not someone "who cah 
just move to a city and start there," he 
had considered making New Haven 
his permanent home but thought that 
..jle was too young for that decision. If 
he ran again, he felt it would be "so dif-
ficult to ever make a break, more dif-
ficult with every act I committed on the 
Board of Aldermen." So, somewhat 
ironically, he leaves New Haven this 
January because, for him, it was 
becoming too much of a home. And 
even more ironically, he plans to go to 
Thailand, to work for a development 
organization in a place where he has no 
connections, where he will in fact start 
over again. "I'm no less persuaded now 
that getting involved at every level is 
not just beneficial but critical," he says, 
revealing the same motivations that he 
had two years ago. "When things go 
wrong, really it makes me all the more 
inspired to go and change them. 
Maybe that's my own naivete."
