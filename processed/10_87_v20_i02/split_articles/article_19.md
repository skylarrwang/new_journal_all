The argument simply 
did not wash. 
diversionary arguments. The White 
House, conservative senators, and 
witnesses 
including former Chief 
Justice Warren Burger insisted that 
" Judge Bork's record had been dis· 
torted. The charges of distortion, 
however, were rarely accompanied by 
any explanations of which allegation 
regarding Judge Bork's record was in-
accurate. The President appeared at a 
California meeting to once again assert 
that Bork would be a law-and-order 
justice, but to little avail. As the situa-
tion deteriorated, Mr. Reagan, who 
had run for president on a platform 
that expressly called for an ideological 
test for nominees, asserted that rejec-
tion of Judge Bork on account of his 
ideology would be a grave threat to the 
independence of the .federal courts. 
That argument, from a man who haa 
made a career out of denouncing the 
Supreme Court, was greeted with a 
justified degree of incredulity. 

In retrospect, Robert Bork may 
never have been confirmable, his 
judicial views too far to the right to sur-
vive any serious public scrutiny. But 
the Administration's own efforts to sell 
Bork to the Senate and to the Ameri 
can people turned a probable defeat in-
to a certain debacle. Over six years in 
office the President and his advisors 
had grown too accustomed to selling 
legislative proposals with blue smoke 
and mirrors, and too arrogant to treat 
the Congress and the public as a 
legitimate part of the democratic pro-
cess .
