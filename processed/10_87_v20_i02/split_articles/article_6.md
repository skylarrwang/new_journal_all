Last Call 
Yalies do not initiate all of New 
Haven's traditions. Located behind 
Timothy Dwight College, a pub called 
Malone's has been dedicated for over a 
half-century to Irish-style celebration 
for Yale students and city residents 
alike. But recent news that the building 
which houses the pub will be demol-
ished leaves its patrons wondering if 
the crumbling structure will carry the 
traditions of Malone's with it. 

For the handful of students, mostly 
from Silliman and TD, who frequent 
Malone's, the pub's closing will mean 
the end of a tradition. "It was like an in-
itiation into TD when the seniors would 
take us there on Sunday nights," re-
called Christina Ayala (TD '89). For 
many, the pub has'provided a welcome 
alternative to the jukebox blasting, 
socially fast-paced pizza joints around 
campus. At Malone's, customers don't 
treat beer as simply a means to an end; 
they consider drinking an art in itself. 

Last year, John Sylvain (TD '87) sat 
drinking a scotch and beer when a 
newcomer challenged him to "tang." 
Taking a sip, he responded, "No,. I'm 
going to drink this slowly so I can en-
joy it as it goes down." 

Poor lighting, a musty atmosphere, 
and 
a complete dissociation with ~ 
anything "Yale" characterize the inside 
of Malone's. Instead of "Hotel Califor-
nia," the jukebox offers an eclectic mix 
of less overplayed Motown, Irish folk 
songs, and rock. Distractions range 
from the futuristic Trivia-Quiz to the 
ancient dartboard. The walls are 
decorated not with drawings of"Yale in 
1875" or "The First Yale-Harvard 
Crew Race," but with drawings of 
Ireland, relics from Saint Patrick's 
Days gone by, and black-and-white 
photographs taken by a regular, Russ 
Southand. "Most of those were taken 
at the old location around the corner," 
Southand said. When asked what occa-
sion prompted one photo in which the 
people seemed especially festive, both .i 
owner and photographer laughed. 
"That was the wake we threw mourn-
ing the last day before the old Malone's 
closed in '72."
