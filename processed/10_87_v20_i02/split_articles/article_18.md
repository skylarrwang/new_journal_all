Injudicious Planning 
On July 1, 1987, the Reagan Ad-
ministration faced what most observers 
thought was an interesting but hardly 
difficult task- to persuade the Senate 
to confirm Judge Robert Bork as an 
associate justice of the United States 
Supreme Court. The right wing views 
that had won Judge Bork the nomina-
tion, to be sure, had little public sup-
port. But the Administration evidently 
perceived no need to deal directly with 
the substance of Bork's ideas. For over 
six years President Reagan had suc-
ceeded beyond all reason in persuading 
Congress to approve measures which 
legislators believed made little sense. 
The White House began the Bork con-
firmation process confident that it 
could rely once more on the arsenal of 
tactics that had so often succeeded in 
the past. 

But 1987 was not 1981; the Presi-
dent's personal popularity was on the 
wane, and the Democrats had regained

control of the Senate. Lobbying prac-
tices that had once sufficed largely 
because of the President's political 
dominance now had to stand on their 
own. After six years those practices 
had become so familiar and seemingly 
effective that the Administration was 
unable to perceive their inherent 
weaknesses; as the weeks went by, 
White House lobbyists shifted with in-
creasing haste from one tactic to 
another, never understanding why 
none were working and never coming 
to grips with the substantive problems 
posed 
by Judge 
Bork's record. 

Towards the end some conservatives 
would criticize the White House for 
not lobbying harder on Judge Bork's 
behalf. But the nomination failed, not 
because the White House did too little, 
but because the White House did 
precisely the sorts of things it had done 
in the past, learning too late that those 
approaches were ineffective and at the
•• 
time counterproductive. 

The marketing of Judge Bork; 
opened with the boldest of White 
House arguments, that the Senate had 
no business even considering Judge 
Bork's "philosophy," i.e., that the 
Senate was required to ignore what 
Bork had said he would do if he were 
on the Supreme Court. This was a 
natural argument for an Administra-
tion whose expansive views of ex-
ecutive authority rivaled the territorial 
ambitions of Czarist Russia. Just as 
the White House had long sought to 
circumscribe the role of Congress in 
foreign policy, so too the White House 
was attracted to a doctrine that would 
have eviscerated the advise and con-
sent function of the Senate. 

Most of July was consumed arguing;" 
unsuccessfully that the Senate could 
not consider the ideology of a judicial 
nominee. But the White House posi-
tion quickly ran into a series of fatal
