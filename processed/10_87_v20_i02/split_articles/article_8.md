Mac in the USSR 
Pat Sajak and Vanna White flashed 
across the screen as the Russians 
watched in confused admiration. Van-
na looked radiant- she wore sequins 
and a million-dollar smile. The Soviets 
did not.路 Pat spun the wheel and 
beckoned with his outstretched arm. 
Lips pursed over brown-edged teeth, 
his Russian audience followed the 
gesture, staring hard at the screen. 

The Soviets spoke to one another in 
confused tones as disparate clips from 
the program splashed at their faces. I 
stood among them, wanting to groan 
and explain that this technicolor image 
was not the essence of my native 
culture. But I kept silent, because they 
wanted to watch. 

I had not come to Russia to watch 
Wheel of Fortune. I arrived in Moscow 
last summer intending to step com-
pletely out of my own culture and into 
another for two short months. Impos-
sible. Within every circle of Soviet 
society that my life touched, people 
were fascinated by the United States. 

My first night in Moscow, a new 
Soviet acquaintance 
leaned coolly 
against a marble pillar of the metro sta-
tion and inquired, "So, how's Michael 
Jackson doing?" I discovered that, 
despite Soviet government propaganda 
portraying the U.S. as a decadent and 
exploitative society, many Russians 
see America as highly seductive, and 
its citizens as privileged golden people. 

Besieged with both idyllic and hor-
rific images of my own society, I 
became curious when American ac-
quaintances tOld me about a Moscow 
exhibit on American culture and 
technology, sponsored by the U.S. In-
formation Agency. I wanted to see my 
own government's representation of 
life in the United States. My acquain-
tances said that the line for "America" 
was four hours long, but that Amer-
icans could slip in the back door by 
showing a passport to the guard. 

Guiltily, I and two friends did just 
that. 

Expecting a Disneyland spectacle of 
apple-pie propaganda, I stepped inside 
the exhibit suspicious, but curious. 
A huge photograph of Ronald Rea-
gan's smiling face greeted me at the 
6 The New Journal/October 16, 1987 
door. A blur of television screens filled 
the wall beside him, illustrating, as the 
sign said in Russian, "The Democratic 
Process." MTV-style, technicolor im-
ages of the '84 presidential election 
flashed on and off. Reagan, Mondale, 
Ferraro, Bush, Hart, McGovern, and

the rest, handshaking, conceding, win-
ning. Each political image moved 
me- admiration for one candidate, 
contempt for another. As the responses 
ripped through me in a wave of heady 
culture shock, I realized that I . had. 
found a window back into my own 
society. Within this exhibit I stood on 
my own turf, a sensation I had not ex-
perienced since leaving the States. I 
watched the screens critically, but with 
a warm familiarity that came from 
responding to things American. 

The Russians, after glancing quickly 
at this display, filed past me in pursuit 
of the really good stuff. It was all there: 
televisions, 
microwaves, 
washing 
machines, computers, stereos- the 
place resembled a discount appliance 
store. Soviets shook their heads and 
sighed as they read the explanation 
cards describing each product in Rus-
sian. A Dodge 4-wheel drive vehicle 
was parked in the middle of the ex-
hibit, and the Soviets crowded around 
it, jostling for a look inside. A young 
man ran his finger solemnly along the 
polished surface. In my eyes, the large 
blue vehicle seemed to acquire new 
prestige. 

路 In another corner, a crowd had 
gathered around a Macintosh com-
puter, the same type I use at school. 
While I regarded its all-too-familiar 
face with mixed emotions, the Rus-
sian.s 
touched the, Mac hesitantly, 
pokmg at the keyboard. Nothing was 
happening. One man reached ten-
tatively for the mouse, and his inability 
to manipulate it frustrated me as I 
watched. I stifled an impulse to grab 
the mouse and say, "Look, people! 
Macwrite, Save, Quit." 

I moved away from the Macintosh 
with the uncomfortable feeling that I 
was part of a wealthy estate which had 
let the peasants in for a day to gape. I 
walked through the crowd anony-
mously, vacillating between the im-
pulse to announce proudly that this 
was all mine and the overriding urge to 
keep silent out of embarrassment over l 
my conspicious wealth. I was thrilled 
to feel myself back in my culture, and I 
wanted to explain it to the Soviets as 
they had presented theirs to me, ap-
proaching each person to convey my 
own understanding of the marvels they 
observed. At the same time I wondered 
about my gover~'ment's motivations 
for displaying such prosperity. The 
Soviets appeared duly awed, but they 
admired the American accomplish-
ments as objects beyond their grasp. I 
overheard one Soviet tell his friend, 
"Well, they have and we don't have." 

. I wandered over to where Pat and 
Vanna were beckoning from a wall of 
televisions. Thirty-second images of 
other American programs, past ,and 
present, flashed by in this flickering 
montage. I fixed on the screens, in " 
dulging in a moment of nostalgia for 
television reruns. The Cosby Show ap-
peared in路 one corner, vanished, then 
reappeared on another screen. The So-
viets stared hard at Cosby him-
self- Russians see few black people, 
and the Soviet government talks a 
great deal about racism in the States. 

An exuberant contestant was spin-
ning the Wheel of Fortune when a 
Soviet standing beside me made a 
remark about television technology 
to which I responded in my imperfect 
Russian. Noticing the accent, he asked 
where I was from. His eyebrows shot 
up when I answered. Americans in 
Moscow are still pretty rare, and he 
'grabbed his friend, telling him that he .I 
had found one. The exhibit featured 
Americans employed to answer visi-
tors' questions, but these men wanted 
an unofficial source. They 路seemed to 
have a mental list of burning questions
