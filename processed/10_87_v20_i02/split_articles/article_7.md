Fowl Play 
Laurie Kincade (ES '88) remembered 
it as if it happened yesterday. "It was 
quarter to seven, and I had just barely 
made it to dinner. Then I realized it 
was Chicken Basquaise Night. But 
there was none! Just some kind of 
chicken with herbs. I said, 'Is this 
chicken basquaise?' and the dining hall 
people looked at me like I was speaking 
a foreign language." 

A foreign language, indeed. The 
New Journal of September 4, 1987 
reported in English that "On Sept. 15, 
the Yale dining halls will offer chicken 
basquaise to 5000 people." Apparently, 
the students in Ezra Stiles were not 
among them. Students there were 
served herb chicken falsely labeled 
chicken basquaise. Amid charges of 
scandal, corruption, and cover-up in 
the highest echelons of the food ad-
ministration, the question resounded 
through the cement-and-steel Stiles 
dining hall- What did Ed Homa, 
manager of Stiles-Morse, know about 
the chicken substitution, and when did 
he know it? 

Homa claims not to have known 
much. The omission was "just an over-
sight. The basquaise was a last-minute 
substitution on the menu," he said . 
"We used to have a clerical person who 
would have caught it, but she's gone 
.. 

now." Homa added that he "apologized 
publicly" for the mix-up. 

In what may have been a desperate 
attempt to salvage Homa's career, 
Bruce Harris, 
the 
new assistant 
manager of Stiles-Morse, took the fall 
for the scandal. "The buck stops here 
on this one," he said. "We just missed it 
on the menu." Harris tried also to ex-
plain why a sign on the herb chicken 
called it basquaise. "We probably got 
the sign from the nutrition office, who 
duly gave it to the right person, who 
duly put it up." Informed Stilesians 
were not duped. "I knew that the bas-
quaise stuff was supposed to have 
tomatoes and peppers," Reyna Marder 
(ES '88) said. But Talia Bloch (ES '88) 
voiced anger at the substitution. "We 
were all deceived," she said. 

The dining hall administration 
seems to have weathered the scandal. 
Harris reported no complaints about 
the basquaise incident, and Homa, 
after returning from the "month's vaca-
tion in Florida" he took after the story 
broke, promised that the chicken 
would appear in its correct incarnation 
on a later menu. However, serious 
questions remain.- How did the 
alteration of menus take place? Was 
criminal tampering with Yale 
documents involved?- What hap-
pened to the "nine six-gallon cans of 
peeled tomatoes" that, according to 
New Journal reporter James Bennet 
(TD '88), awaited crushing in the 
Stiles-Morse kitchen?- Does anyone 
really want to see chicken basquaise 
back on the meriu? Although executive 
chef Tom DeDinas said that he had 
"gotten a lot of good comments" from 
dining hall managers in other colleges 
about the entree, some diners felt the 
chicken lacked excitement. Bennet 
refused to comment, and Sasha Grut-
man (BK '89), author of the recipe, did 
not return this reporter's phone calls. 
The two were reportedly seen dining 
together at Popeye's restaurant the 
evening of the fifteenth.
