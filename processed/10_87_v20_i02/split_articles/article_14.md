hot at stake. "Many members have 
culminated a life of political activity by 
coming on the board," says Martin 
Dunleavy, the board's majority leader. 
"But it's almost always a stepping stone 
for the Yale alderperson. They'll leave 
and then go do 'real politics' someplace 
else." 

Ratner and oth.ers involved in Ward 
1 politics recognize this problem. They 
try to avoid innocent statements about 
f .,1. going "home" for the holidays or, as 
happened with one former alderper-
son, driving a car with out-of-state 
license plates. But they still have a bad 
reputation for running through New 
Haven politics. In May 1985, an 
editorial in The New Haven Register 
sharply criticized Ward 1 aldermen. 
"No question the young people are 
likely to bring a great deal of energy, 
along with their inexperience and im-
maturity, to their service as aldermen," 
the article read. "But is youthful ex-
uberance sufficient for 
adequate 
representation, when some of them are 
called away to post-graduate studies or 
career-opening jobs before their o'ne 
and only two-year term is finishea? 
.... We have our doubts." 

A local radio show aired a rebuttal to 
_.. the Register editorial, emphasizing the

attendance records and con-
tributions of Ward 1 aldermen. But the 
criticism has since come up again. 
Ratner promised in his campaign to 
complete his full term, and he says he 
has a deeper commitment to New 
Haven than many people realize. That 
commitment grew when he graduated 
from Yale. Working in the city gave 
him a better sense of the New Haven, 
as opposed to the Yale, community. 
One year into his term, he got a job 
with the Connecticut Food Bank, a 
private nonprofit group which 
distributes irregular but usable food 
products, such as missized cans of 
~oup, to nonprofit organizations that 
serve the hungry. As part of his job, 
Ratner recently helped set up two new 
soup kitchens in New Haven. He 
laughs as he talks about his role. Pic-
ture this, his skeptical look says, pic-
ture this man running around com-
parison shopping for pots and pans. 
Unlike Kenney, both Valentovish and Michaelson claim that they have 
no political goals beyond the New Haven board. 

He trails off in the next breath, his face 
becoming serious. Now, the object of 
comparison is himself. "I was a better 
alderperson when I was not a student," 
he says. 

Among this year's candidates, only 
Kenney will graduate next year; both 
Valentovish and Michaelson (CC '90) 
have further terms at Yale. Not sur-
prisingly, as students they are led to 
view their prospective experience on 
the board as just that: experience. 
Running on the Green Party ticket, 
Michaelson says that "as a student it's a 
fabulous education to get involved with 
people who do community activism. 
I've had the chance to talk to people 
from 
AIDS 
groups, 
neighborhood groups . . . . I think 
Yale students don't recognize how 
much New Haven influences their 
lives." 

Michaelson does not call 
New 
Haven "home" but says he feels a deep 
commitment to the city because he 
lives here now. Valentovish, on the 
other hand, says she would feel com-
fortable calling New Haven home even 
after she graduates, partly because it 
reminds her of her neighborhood in 
Pittsburgh. But regardless of the can-
didates' interest in the city, none of 
them has family in New Haven and 
none of them has lived here for more 
than four years. For these reasons 
alone, they will find themselves at a 
political disadvantage when they first 
arrive on the board. 

Twenty-eight of the 30 seats on the 
New Haven Board of Aldermen are oc-
cupied by Democrats. The other two 
belong to Republicans, who have ac-
quired a more liberal reputation than 
that of their party. A commonly held 
view of New Haven politics maintains 
that the board often works as a support 
system for the DiLieto administration; 
it has been described as "a rub-
berstamp board" or the product of"the 
Democratic machine." 

Joe Carbone, executive assistant to 
the 
mayor, 
considers 
term 
"machine" insulting to the electorate of 
the city, but few politicians deny the 
machine's existence. Ratner describes 
the system as "quid pro quo," saying 
that a number of representatives have 
family members on the city's payroll. 
But while· he recognizes that the 
machine exists, Ratner grows angry 
over the 
idea of a 
monolithic 
Democratic Party. "As long as I'm on 
the board," he says, "the Democratic 
Party is not monolithic. It makes me 
mad, 
because it says 
I'm an 
automaton. And that is offensive to me 
after I've spent two years thinking 
about these issues." 

As the Democratic candidate, Ken-
ney has wprked most closely with the 
party in New Haven, and she also 
resents the party's stereotype. She 
thinks that Democrats have two 
distinct advantages over Republicans 
or Green Party members in the Ward 
-1 seat. First, they have the freedom to 
vote against the administration when 
the need arises. And second, they have 
the "fundamental alliance" belonging 
to Democrats on the board. Her op-
ponents, Kenney says, "talk about be-
ing able to be critics from outside. But 
they really will be outside and left out. 
I don't think any Yale student can 
march in and start telling the board 
what to do from outside." 

In terms of her political approach, 
Kenney follows much the same line of 
reasoning as Ratner, who has evolved 
into something of an independent 
thinker on the board. At the beginning 
of his term, other aldermen waited to 


Right now, Ratner considers Kenney heavily favored to win this year's 
Ward 1 race. 

see how he would interact with dif-
ferent 
forces: 
pro -DiLieto, 
Republican, independent Democrat. 
"He started out as 'I'm brighter. I'm 
here to save the world.' He started out 
rather naive," says Chuck Allen, 
representative from Newhallville. One 
of the 
board's most 
independent 
voices, Allen entered city politics ten 
years ago at about the same age Ratner 
is now. 

Having worked with a number of 
Ward 1 aldermen, Allen has recognized a 
definite evolution during most of their 
terms. "It's a unique situation. In very 
few other cities can you walk in and be 
on the board after a year or two in 
town. For that reason, not because 
you're younger or a student, you 
necessarily go through a period of ad-
justment and growth. Without being 
condescending, I'd describe all Yale 
aldermen as going through a period of 
development. All of them start out 
with a kind of textbook attitude about 
their job, armed with the constitution 
and charter on the one hand and on the 
other hand having to respond to an en-
trenched machinery and a very needy 
urban poor population." 

Observers say that after some time 
on the board, Ward 1 aldermen realize 
that 29 other people must enter 
into their plans to change the city. 
They gain political savvy, and their 
transformation does not go unnoticed. 
According to Allen, Ratner became a 
bridge between "the yuppie profes-
sionals of the board and the black com-
munity members of the board." His in-
dependence, however, did not always 
impress those aldermen loyal to the ad-
20 The New JournaVOctober 16, 1987 
ministration. Martin Dunleavy, alder-
person from Ward 27, says that as a 
member of the Democratic Socialists of 
America, 
he has 
a 
left-of-center 
philosophy but an old-player style. In 
the blunter language of other 
aldermen, that means he ends up, 
more of~en than not, voting for legisla-
tion supported by the mayor, tho~gh h_e 
may disgree with it. From Dunleavy'S' 
point of view, Ratner failed on the 
board in one sense because he never 
became an inside player but chose in-
stead to remain an independent, a 
"loner" on the board. 

But that "loner" status enabled 
Ratner to win the support of different 
factions. The board as a whole sup-
ported him, as it demonstrated by 
picking him to run for the single alder-
manic position on the City's Board of 
Finance. "Being trusted by all elements 
of the board like that was no mean ac-
complishment for a Yale student who's 
only been on the board a couple of 
years. He had all the black votes, all of 
the minority poor votes," Allen says. 

Among the boards set up by the mayor 
to run the city, the Board of Finance 
has the most power. As the aldermen's 
representative for the last eight or ten 
years, Louisa DeLauro of Wooster 
Square has, by all accounts, given un-
wavering support to the mayor. Run-
. ning Ratner against her was a signficant 
political 
move for the 
Board of 
Aldermen because it represented an in-
dependent undercurrent on the board. 
The decision to run was also an im-
portant personal move for Ratner, who 
says he would have thought differently 
about abandoning a second term if he 
had won that election. He did not win, 
but he did suffer through a tie vote and 
some hard blows from the city's 
machine. Thinking back on those 
weeks, he looks away as if trying to 
remember a particular moment which 
unlocks the feeling of the race. Once he 
finds it, he looks straight ahead again 
and nods. H e describes the feeling in 
one word. "Hellish," he says. "It was a 
real old-fashioned political brawl. 
There was fierce politicking going 
on .... In hindsight there were a couple t) 
...! 
of things I did that were really naive. 
It's all behind the scenes.'' One event 
involved a supporter on the board who 
ended up abstaining from the vote 
because, as Allen describes it, his wife 
was a cousin of DeLaura's and was 
harassed about , fhe election. Ratner 
mentions another incident, in which a 
supporter on the board was told that if 
he didn't vote for Del.auro, one of his 
constituents would not get a job at the 
fire department, 

But despite these bad moments, 
Ratner still considers the Board of 
Finance election one of two major 
highlights of his term. The other, un-
questionably, was his plan for tlie city 
to convert the National Hotel into 35 
to 50 low-income housing units. While 
this original idea did not pass on the ~ ,
board, the city did agree to find com-
parable housing units scattered 
throughout downtown New Haven. 

What's more, Carbone says that the 
city now anticipates Ratner's objec-
tions to certain projects before they 
reach the board. And the DiLieto ad-
ministration has created HOME, an 
organization designed to administer 
the current housing plan and any 
others in the future. "It's only a small 
part of the solution, the big solution," 
Ratner says, smiling slightly. "But big 
solutions almost never happen." 

So he puts his faith in the smaller 
ones and uses his compromising ability 
to promote them. Ratner has a good 
rapport with the administration, ,# 
despite the fact that he has presented 
them with opposition, and also ·enjoys 
a reputation for thinking on his. own. 
John Einhorn, Republican- represen-
tative from Westville, has a dimmer


tative from Westville, has a dimmer view of most other Ward 1 aldermen. 
He says that the seat "theoretically 
should afford a lot of independence. 
Unfortunately, what's always hap-
pened is the representatives felt they 
should do what the Democratic Party 
thought they should do." 

A ten-year veteran of the board, 
Einhorn views Ratner as one of the 
most 
independent and effective 
aldermen in the history of Ward 1. But 
in the future, he would like to see the 
,. • Green Party have a stronger voice on 
the board, one they could use against 
the Democrats. He feels that the 
Democrats have such a tight hold on 
city government that they are not ac-
countable for their failures. "The city 
really rivals traditional Chicago im-
ages. Tammany Hall had nothing on 
some of the things that happen in New 
Haven;" he says. As a recent example 
of the city's mismanagement, he points 
to the scandal over the parking 
authority; for the past six to 11 
years, the authority has reportedly 
neglected to collect its revenues from 
city merchants. 

Whether or not the Green Party \:vill 
find an elected voice in New Haven 
politics remains unknown, but it cer-
tainly made no advances in last 
:.d rj month's primary. Candidates favored 
by DiLieto's political action committee 
"Democrats for the Future" defeated 
four of the city's incumbent-and most 
independent- aldermen. Chuck Allen 
was one of them. He ran in the 
primary on both the Democratic and 
;:;reen Party tickets as a member of the 
newly formed Progressive Alliance, 
but he never expected to lose. Now he 
faces the choice of either running as a 
Green in No_vember or leaving the 
board. "We just couldn't match the 
organizational skill and fundraising of 
the machine," Allen says. 

"We" inCluded a number of Bill 
Jones supporters and Green Party 
members who decided last July to con-
1 solidate their forces and try to add in-
dependent aldermen to the board. All 
but one of their candidates were 
defeated; Toni Harp benefited in the 
Second Ward from support among 
Morse and Stiles students. The sweep
