EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
opposing, but not formally challeng-
ing, Huntington's election. In the let-
ter, Lang requested only that copies of 
Koblitz's article be distributed to all 
NAS members "so that they can get a 
better idea of the kind of thing Hun-
tington does before they vote for or 
against him." 


In fact, Lang says that he had deci-
ded against challenging Huntington's 
nomination formally until he received 
a letter from julian Wolpert, chairman 
of the N AS section which includes 
social and political scientists. In his let-
ter, Wolpert calls Koblitz's article 
"scurrilous journalism" and criticizes 
Lang for trusting the article over the 
recommendations of NAS members 
from the social sciences. He advises 
Lang that the Academy's challenge 
"was intended to be used responsibly." 


In his office, Lang explains, "So I had 
this brief experience with Bryce 
Crawford. He sent copies to Wolpert. 
And I sent to Wolpert my letter saying 
I'm giving up. Wolpert simultaneously 
doesn't know that and writes me this 
letter which is both stupid and in-
sulting. And then, of course, I reacted. 
Okay, if they want to fight, I'll get in 
too." 


From the ensuing war, Lang emerg-
ed victorious. Huntington twice failed 
to gain enough votes for election to the 
Academy, in 1986 and 1987. A can-
didate challenged at an annual meeting 
is removed from consideration unless 
two-thirds of the members present vote 
to support the scientist. Huntington's 
nomination failed 
to secure the 
necessary number of votes at both 
meetings. Though other NAS 
members formally challenged Hun-
tington both times, Lang's campaign 
against the political scientist appears to 
have been critical in blocking his elec-
tion. In the three mailings he sent to 
NAS members, academicians, and the 
media before the two elections, Lang 
denounced Huntington for "profes-
sional incompetence and defective 
scholarship." Lang's criticisms have 
some support in the Academy, judg:ng 
by the approximately 35 favorable let-
ters he received from NAS members . . 
Several members have claimed that 
Huntington's advocacy of the Yietnam 
War also contributed to his rejection 
from the Academy, though Lang says 
that he attacked only Huntington's 
scholarship. 


In order to "demolish the opposition" 
and to prohibit another nomination, 
Lang sent out his largest mailing ever 
during the second week of September. 
He shipped the 43-page packet to 
over 1800 people. The effort cost him 
approximately $5,000. In the cover let-
ter Lang made an appeal for contribu-
tions, which has so far brought in over 
$1,800. The centerpiece of the mailing 
is an 11-page article with 17 footnotes, 
"On a Recent Non-election to the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences," in which 
Lang restates his criticisms. Lang is 
trying to confront Huntington and his 
supporters on their professional stomp-
ing grounds, the American Political 
Science Association, by submitting the 
article for publication in the APSA's 
journal, PS. The 'article, which Lang 
sent to the magazine on Aug. 17, has 
not been published. 


Lang's campaign has captured 
headlines in The New York Times, The 
Boston Globe, Time, and Science. The ar-
ticles attribute the NAS conflict to ten-
sions between hard and soft scientists 
and support the idea that Huntington's 
early support o(the Vietnam War con-
tributed to hts rejection. "Blood Lust in 
Academia," a searing article in The 
New Republic by Fareed Zakaria, reports 
that Lang, by "focusing on a particular 
scholar who has few pretensions to 
hard science- no game theory, no ex-
pected utility models, no rational 
choice analysis- without explaining 
how his limits are not those inherent in 
social science . . . has turned what 
could have been an interesting debate 
about natural and social sciences into a 
crude, unsubstantiated witch-hunt 
with strong political overtones." 


Although Lang admits that Zakaria's 
article made him appear "silly," he 
said, "I couldn't have hoped for 
anything more." 


The 
article 
falls apart, Lang 
says, because it supports Huntington 
with flawP.d evidence. Zakaria quotes 
Huntington defending the part of his 
textbook which Lang criticized in his 
mailings. In the textbook, Huntington 
refers to a survey that categorizes 
South African society as "satisfied." 
Huntington asserts that, "When this 
study ... was done in the early 1960s, 
there had been no major riots, strikes, 
or disturbances" in South Africa. Lang 
points out that, in fact, a number of 
riots and incidents of repression, in-
cluding the Sharpeville Massacre, took 
place during this period. In his office, 
Lang sighs and waves his hands. 
"What I see over and over again is the 
same pattern. Of course, Zakaria and 
the editors of The New Republic would 
not have printed this imbecility if the 
pattern of their thinking wasn't 
directed along [these lines]. It didn't 
occur to them to go to the library to 
check it out." Though Lang has written 
a 20-page response to Zakaria's article, 
he has not mailed it to the magazine. 
He worries that the New Republic editors 
might alter the piece to distort his 
points and thereby avoid acknowledg-
ing their errors 


Zakaria's article presents another 
weapon which Lang has stored in the 
arsenal he maintains against Hun-
tington: the "Huntington File." Since 
Lang recommenced his political ac-
tivities in 1977, he has recorded his 
epistolary battles to clean up academia 
and the media in his "files." A stapled 
volume that includes photocopied cor-
respondence, documents, 
and 
newsclips, a file can span hundreds of 
pages. So far, Lang has assembled 
nine of them. 


Lang describes the process of mak-
ing a file as a "cat and mouse game." 
He leans forward over his desk, his 
eyes staring ahead. "I know the process 
I'm engaged in. I go into the model I 
make in my mind about what goes on, 
in pitting my wits against theirs." Lang 
shifts in his seat, but his eyes do not 
waver. "I try to create a stage where 
they will not have their usual defenses. 
Where they will make false statements 
I will bring them ' out. I try to make 
them express themselves in ways where 
they will be checked out, and I can 
compare the realities which they create 
as they go along." 


At the beginning of each file, the 
correspondence takes place principally 
between Lang and a few opponents. As 
more people write to Lang, the case 
begins to expand. Leaning back rn his 
chair, Lang illustrates by moving his 
finger in an ever-widening spiral. The 
"carbon copy" lists at the bottom of 
Lang's letters can swell to hundreds of 
names. Lang tucks letters of support 
into his files to fend off charges that he 
has no backers. In the Huntington 
File, he has included copies of some of 
the approximately 35 supportive letters 
from NAS members. Five Academy 
members also sent him critical letters, 
which he has not included in the file. 


The older, bound files sit in his 
cabinets and book cases, until someone 
requests a copy or Lang chooses to give 
one away, as he has done in some of his 
classes. The Huntington File remains 
unbound; Lang is still accumulating 
material. 


The File, a 700-page book that Lang 
published in 
1981, 
describes 
the 
1977-79 war pitting him against two 
sociologists: Seymour Martin Lipset 
and Everett Carll Ladd, Jr._ Referring 
to the sociologists as "parasites on the 
academic community," Lang attac;ked
Between classes and causes, Lang puts in twelve hours a day, seven days 
a week.
