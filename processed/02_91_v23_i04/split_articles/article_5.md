An annual grant of $98,000 to Hillhouse High School is creating unusual opportunities for Its top students. 

The sign in front of New Haven's oldest 
high school reads: "Hillhouse High 
School: Champions in Athletics and 
Academics." While Hillhouse students 
have always excelled in athletics, the 
arrival of the Macy Prep program in 
1986 boosted confidence in the 
classroom. A grant provides a select 
group of students with special science 
instruction and enriched courses in 
English and math. For the past five 
years, the Josiah Macy Foundation has 
given this inner-city high school a 
$98,000 annual grant to fund an 
ambitious curriculum for the top 40 
students in each class. Still, Hillhouse 
administrators realize that the Macy 
program must contend with the 
overwhelming problems that their 
students face. "We have kids that are 
coming from family situations that are 
really disastrous," said Marc Blosveren, 
the Macy program director at Hillhouse. 
'We are fighting against those disasters 
to get the kids to realize that they can 
do the work. We can get them into

instead of projecting 
into the future, have 
reacted to crisis. We 
have a real crisis 
going on." 
college." 

The Macy Foundation, dedicated to 
" minority science education," chose 
Hillhouse because of its almost entirely 
African-American population. The 
grant pays for extra class time, training 
for teachers, and lab materials for 
science courses. Hillhouse science 
teachers have used some of the money 
to attend workshops at the famous Cold 
Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long 
Island. 

To qualify for the program, 
students must demonstrate that they 
read at their grade level. This group 
constitutes about ten percent of the 
s tudents at Hillhouse. Even if the 
students qualify, the administration 
only takes students who demonstrate an 
active interest in the Macy curriculum. 
Once accepted, students cannot cut 
more than two classes per semester to 
stay in the program. 

The English component of the 
Hillhouse Macy program includes
