demography, integration cannot 
proceed without busing. 

Even if state officials could 
convince residents that busing is in their 
best interest, there's no saying the 
program would work. Busing has 
already failed once in New Haven. In 
the '60s and '70s, the city sent 
elementary school children to North 
Haven and other suburbs through a 
state-funded voluntary integration 
arrangement called Project Concern. The 
program still buses about 700 Hartford 
students to the suburbs, though no 
suburban kids make the opposite 
commute. Project Concern reached its 
heyday in New Haven in the early '70s 
but could not, according to Tirozzi, 
weather suburban hostility. 

"The suburban districts were 
behaving like private schools," Tirozzi 
said. Students were hand-selected for 
the project, and the suburban schools 
often sent back children with academic 
or behavioral problems. "In a public 
system, if kids act up, you don't return

business. Since students decide what 
them," Tirozzi said. "New Haven 
officials began to wonder why they 
were taking our best students and 
returning the ones they didn't want." 

Discouraged by the experience and 
facing a fiscal crisis, the city pulled out 
from the program altogether. 

Whether Connecticut manages to 
make voluntary integration work this 
time or the court hands the state a 
mandate, 
city 
officials 
cannot 
desegregate urban centers on their own. 

"The state must e ndorse collective 
responsibility to desegregate the schools 
of 
Connecticut," 
said 
Tirozzi. 
Connecticut Civil Liberties Union 
lawyer Philip Tegeler believes state 
involvement 
is 
forthcoming. 

"Connecticut cannot administer a 
system that deprives children of equal 
education opportunities," he said. ''This 
case is as much about quality education 
as it is about desegregation."

language they want to take, administrators 
cannot socially engineer particular 
classrooms. "Realistically, we'd like to have 
each class fall within a ratio of two to one, 
minority to non-minority, or vice versa," 
Saxon said. "But that is an awkward thing 
to try to impose." While the Japanese class 
i<> racially mixed, most students in the 
Chinese class are either African-American 
or Latino. ln the Russian class, most of the 
students are white. Saxon admits that the 
program has struggled with drawing non-
white students into Russian classes. 

"Attracting minority students historically 
has been a problem for Soviet studies," 
Saxon said. Students said that African-
Americans in particular feel uncomfortable 
m the Russian class. "1 knew a black girl 
who dropped Russian," said Tina 
Couverthier, a junior in the Japanese class. 
"It was like being a mouse in a room full of 
elephants." 

The after-school language program 
cannot remedy Connecticut's integration 
woes on its own. But the program does 
bradge gaps between kids from different 
parts of the New Haven area. "In my class, 
we are all friends," Couverthier said. A few 
romances have even sprung up among the 
after-school students. The program also 
brings students to Hillhouse who might 
never have come otherwise. Nl'd never 
really seen the inside of an urban high 
school before," ..aid Hopkins senior Richard 
Coluris, a student in the Japanese class. "It's 
good for kids from the suburbs to see." The 
International Studies program strives to 
open the minds of New Haven students to 
the world around them, not just across the 
globe, but in their own hometown.
