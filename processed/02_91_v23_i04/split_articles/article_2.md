After they finish classes at New Haven's 
Sheridan Middle School, Jason Jackson 
and Jerome Harper take the bus 
downtown to the newly-renovated 
main branch of the public library. It's 
not that their homework requires 
endless research; Jackson and Harper go 
to the library every day because they 
like it. "It's better than home," 
explained Jackson as he looked up from 
a math problem. "It's good for doing 
homework. There are no distractions or 
temptations here." Harper added, "It's 
really nice here. It's a place to learn 
more." 

Jackson and Harper are taking 
advantage of the downtown library's 
recent expansion. Despite the city's 
fiscal crisis, the New Haven library 
system raised enough money to expand 
its central facility. The New Haven Free 
Public Library, on the corner of Elm and 
Temple Streets, re-opened 
last 
November 
after 
undergoing 
renovations costing nearly $17 million. 

While New Haven still lags far behind 
nearby cities in library services, officials 
hope this expansion will make up some 
of the difference. 

The renovations took more than 
6 The New Journal 
two years to complete and tripled the 
library's size to 100,000 square feet. The 
new space provides room for 80 percent 
of the library's collection in open stacks; 
before, readers had to wait for librarians 
to fetch most books. The library also 
boasts a new public computer facility, 
an audio-visual station with compact 
disc players and video cassette 
recorders, an employment information 
section, and rooms for literacy tutoring. 

Despite the recent expansion, the 
library system has not escaped the fiscal 
restraints that have hurt all of New 
Haven's city services. 
In 1976, there 
were eight libraries throughout the city; 
today only four remain. Forty-eight 
people staff the main library, down 
from 83 two years ago, and the library 
opens its doors only 33 hours a week. A 
government study found that New 
Haven has the smallest library b udget 
per capita in all of Connecticu t. But 
librarians are still optimistic. "When 
we're open, everything is accessible and 
there is plenty of staff to help," said 
Joanne Connelly, director of t he 
reference department. "We'd rather 
stay open fewer hours and p rovide 
good service than open for more hours 
than we could handle." 

Some say that 33 hours, even with 
good service, isn't nearly enough . "It's 
ridiculous," argued Harry O'Connor, 
librarian at Wilbur Cross High School. 
"You're talking six days a week. And 
out of the whole six days you can only 
find thirty-some hours to go there." 

Although library hours have 
shortened, librarians have made the 
main branch more accessible to 
students. Teachers can request library 
tours for their classes, and a Children's 
Services Department handles the needs 
of elementary sch,qol readers. To attract 
teenagers, the library created a new 
young-adult reading section and 
boosted its research facilities. "We're a 
pretty central location, and the other 
branches have limited resources," 
Connelly said. "High school students 
are going to have to come here to do 
their research papers." Nevertheless, 
many local students have not yet 
discovered their new library. 

"I just found out about it three days 
ago," said Odette Morrison, a junior at 
Cooperative High SchooL 
"It's a great 
place just to relax and read. But nobody 
knows about it. I wouldn't have heard 
about it if my friend hadn't brought 
me." Hillhouse High School English 
teacher Fran Perricotti asked her 
students whether they use the public 
libraries. "The feedback I get is that they 
really don't," said Perricotti. 

Ernest Roth, assistant principal at 
Hillhouse, agrees with this assessment. 
"My guess is that they probably don't 
use it very much. As they get to the 
high school, I don't think there are 
many opportunities for kids to be made 
aware of the public library and the 
resources they have." 

The only library many New Haven 
students use is the one in their school. 
Both major city high schools, Wilbur 
Cross and Hillhouse, have small school 
libraries which provide reference 
materials, periodicals, and a modest 
book collection of 11,000 volumes. "We 
get students here from A to Z, from 
third grade reading level to future Yale 
students," O'Connor noted. "I've got to
