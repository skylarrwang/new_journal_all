papers that juniors and seniors face each

H illhouse library could use more 
resources," said Hillhouse teacher 
Robert Moore. To help students in their 
research, he encourages his students to 
use the public library system. "The 
library is limited," said Moore. "But 
you have to direct your students. If they 
want to do serious research, they are 
going to have to go to the public 
library." With the renovated main 
branch now open, more students like 
Jackson and Harper may take Moore's 
advice.
