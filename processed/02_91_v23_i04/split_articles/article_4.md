Jeffie Frazier worries about her students. 
"Even at elementary schools," said the 
principal of the Helene Grant School, 
"children are being killed over 
expensive items." But Frazier and a 
growing number of local educators 
think they have a solution: public school 
uniforms. 

In 1988, Helene Grant became the 
first of five New Haven elementary 
schools to put students in uniform. Four 
other schools-Truman, Vincent Mauro, 
Lincoln Basset, and Columbus-soon 
followed suit, while students at Isadore 
Wexler and Jackie Robinson Middle 
School will begin wearing uniforms next 
September. "The idea came from the 
parents," 
Frazier 
said. 
"They 
understand what children are going 
through if other children make fun of 
Uniform advocates want students to devote less attention to fashion trends.

them." Debra Kelly, who has three 
children at Grant, is a big fan of the 
policy. "I think it's a fantastic idea," she 
said. "In today's economy, you just 
don't have the money to spend on 
clothes." 

Charles Flynn, principal of the 
Truman School, has parents like Kelly in 
mind. "The uniforms are economical 
and easy to maintain," he said. "The 
students need about two sets to last the 
year." Both Helene Grant and Truman 
help parents who cannot afford the 
uniforms, which range between $30 and 
$50. Robinson, however, provides no 
such assistance. ''We don't help parents 
when they buy their children clothing at 
the beginning of the school year," said 
principal Charles Warner. "After all, we 
have a lot of kids around here wearing 
$100 sneakers." 

Administrators feel that putting 
students in identical clothing gets rid of 
a primary source of competition. They 
want students to devote more attention 
to homework and less to fashion. "We 
needed to eliminate an obstacle to 
learning," Frazier said. "We instill in the 
students the idea that clothes can be 
thrown away, but what you have inside 
your brain, no one can take from you." 

Flynn adds that uniforms will help 
maintain security. "If you come into the 
school and you're not in uniform, you 
get a second look," said Flynn. "The kid 
who's just drifting in, scouting out the 
place--1 want to know what he's doing 
here." Both principals say their students 
feel part of a special group when in 
uniform; they are members of a 
distinctive and respected school. ''We're 
conveying the concept of family," said 
Flynn. "We're one big Truman family. 
When you're out on the street with that 
uniform on, you're representing 
Truman." 

The policies seem to work. At 
Grant, Frazier reports that since 
students began wearing uniforms, test 
scores have risen, while the number of 
disciplinary cases has dropped. All her
