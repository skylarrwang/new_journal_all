**Title: To Teach the Children**

Frances Edwards takes the witness stand to describe how her 
husband abused her for years before the night she loaded his 
gun and fired several bullets into his head. The jurors listens 
intently to Edwards' story. After hearing the evidence, they 
reason that Edwards, since her husband was asleep when she 
shot him, could not have acted in self-defense. They convict 
her of voluntary manslaughter and sentence her to several Â· 
years in prison. 

This courtroom is on the second floor of Hillhouse High 
School, where Dr. Burt Saxon teaches a course in 
Ethnoliterature, a tenth grade elective that combines world lit-
erature with social studies. On this day Saxon has chosen to 
teach his class about the criminal justice system by staging a 
mock trial. He tells them that he admires their verdict .. Then 
one student raises his hand. "If a man is beating his wife, what 
should she do?" he asks Saxon. "What would you recommend 
besides murder?" 

Saxon pauses for a moment. "Well, the only thing a bat-
tered wife can really do is get out of there, get some help," he 
says. "There's a battered women's shelter in New Haven, and 
if you speak to me privately, I can give you the phone number. 
But they keep the location a secret so the husbands can't follow 
their wives there." 

"Then how do you know where it is?" one student shouts 
out. 

"Because he chased his wife there," another yells. The 
classroom explodes in laughter. A bemused Saxon stands in 
front of the class. "A lot of teachers might have gotten offend-
ed by that joke," he explains later. "But I want the kids to feel 
like they can joke with me. And I suspected that some of the 
kids in the class knew someone who needed that phone num-
ber. I want them to know that I am accessible to them." 

Saxon has been teaching the Ethnoliterature class for two 
years. The 19 students read thinkers from Buddha to Bacon 
and discuss issues ranging from religious ethics to ethnicity in 
contemporary America. The eclecticism of the course might 
prove daunting to some instructors, but Saxon has never limit-
ed himself to teaching just one subject. At Hillhouse he also 
teaches Psychology and two lunchtime seminars. He coordi-
nates the school's Gifted and Talented Program, as well as an 
after-school International Studies Program and a Saturday 
enrichment session. He teaches a Yale Residential College 
Seminar about urban education, and in his free time, cheers his 
students on at Hillhouse basketball games. 

Although not all of his students are members of the 
Gifted and Talented program, Saxon teaches primarily what 
school administrators call "high-echelon" students. Roughly 
10 percent of Hillhouse's student body falls into this category, 
including all of the students in the Ethnoliterature class. "The 
kids in Ethnoliterature are definitely among the better kids in 
the tenth grade," Saxon says. "Since September, ten of the 19 
32 The New Journal 
kids have not missed a single day of school." 

"It's my favorite class," says sophomore Craig Moore. 
Ethnoliterature gives Moore and his classmates the chance to 
critique their readings and each others' work through discus-
sion. One student faults the defense in the mock trial for hav-
ing "a long, extraneous closing statement." And when the dis-
cussion moves into a reading from German artist Kathe 
Kollewitz's musings on love, the students clamor for a chance 
to read aloud. Afterwards, Saxon asks them to write questions 
about the reading, and one student writes, "If love is so 
painful, what is so good about love?" 

When the students aren't asking such questions, they are 
chattering, passing candy to each other, and mocking Saxon's 
sense of humor. "Most teachers discipline their students to the 
point where the kids are comatose," Saxon says. "I don't do 
that. If anything, I tend to overstimulate my students." He 
chats with them about their love lives, their families, and their 
extracurricular activities-and he tries to relate their experi-
ences to the academic world. Ethnoliterature student Alethea 
Sealy recalls a recent debate."We had a debate in class on 
which do you succeed in more--higher education or sports 
and entertainment?" says Sealy. "Higher education won." 

When the bell rings, several Ethnoliterature students stay 
after class to help Saxon arrange the chairs for his next class, 
Psychology. Unlike other Hillhouse classes, where students sit 
in rows, Saxon's students sit in a semicircle. Psychology is a 
senior elective, and the students are more sedate than the 
younger Ethnoliterature pupils. They also seem well-versed in 
the lingo, using phrases like "positive reinforcement" and 
"Oedipal stage." Today's discussion centers on Erik Erikson's 
eight stages of human development; most students prefer 
Erikson's theory to Freud's more rigid phases of childhood. 

Saxon says that discussions can sometimes get unruly. "Last 
week I asked, 'What happens if a boy never resolves the 
Oedipus complex?' And one kid said, 'He becomes a homo-
sexual,"' he recalls. "That was basically the end of the class. 
Everybody was yelling and screaming." 

Though the students sometimes disrupt class, they still 
respect their teacher. "He's like a father to us," said Sealy. 

To many of his students, Dr. Burt Saxon has become a surrogate father. 
"There's no one in the class who downs him." Saxon has equal 
admiration for his students. "They're all really bright kids. Out 
of 13 students in Psychology, I think ten will go on to some 
form of higher learning next year. One just got a basketball 
scholarship to Quinnipiac College." 

While Saxon doubts that any of his senior students will 
end up at Yale, he holds high hopes for the two juniors in his 
lunchtime seminars. One seminar student has chosen to study 
psychology, the other Western Civilization, but Saxon has 
managed to interweave the topics in his discussions. The stu-
dents recently got into a heated argument over the literary and 
philosophical merits of B.F. Skinner's Walden Two-hardly 
typical high school fare. "The seminar is definitely not a tradi-
tional class," says Assistant Principal Ernest Roth. "I've sat in 
on a few of the seminars-he's very good at motivating stu-
dents and getting good discussion going." 

Saxon used to teach more seminars than he does now, in 
topics ranging from East Asian Studies to Law. He wishes that 
he could teach 40 students in seminars instead of just a few, 
but he does not have enough time to expand the program. 
Even if he did, other academic offerings like Yale's Branch 
tutoring and the International Studies program have been 
drawing potential students away from the seminars. "It seems 
like everyone wants to teach the best kids," he sighs. "It goes 
against our American concept of fairness. Why should the bet-
ter kids get all the resources? But they're the kids who give the 
most response. And when you concentrate on a small group of 
kids, you get better results." 


Saxon focuses a lot of attention on 
the several programs he currently 
supervises. Administration takes up 
about 60 percent of Saxon's time-and 
all of his weekday afternoons. He 
spends four hours a day running 
errands for the International Studies 
teachers, talking to students, and selling 
potato chips to earn the International 
Studies program some petty cash. After 
venturing downstairs to make copies 
four times in 20 minutes, he collapses in 
his office in the library. "That's my new 
world record for trips to the Xerox 
machine," he says. "Sometimes I feel 
like a human paper sorter in this job. 
There's a part of me that wishes I could 
teach all day." 

Saxon knew by 1967, his sopho-
more year at Carleton College in 
Minnesota, that he wanted to teach. 
Growing up in Plainfield, Illinois, the son 
of the town's only attorney, he felt considerable pressure to 
take over his father's law practice after college. "But I didn't 
want to do that," he says. "I wanted to start off on my own, 
and I had a real calling to education. I knew I wasn't going to 
make a lot of money, but I didn't mind." After graduating 
from Carleton, he received a master's degree at Wesleyan 
University, and went directly to the New Haven school district 
to teach social studies. 'Wesleyan had a reputation for turning 
out a lot of radicals," Saxon recalls. 

In 1970, Saxon took his first job in New Haven, and apart 
from a two-year leave of absence in the mid-70s to earn a doc-
torate in education at Columbia University, he has spent his 
entire professional life in the city's public schools. In 1980, he 
earned a promotion, moving from Lee High School to 
Hillhouse to coordinate the school's Gifted and Talented pro-
gram. 

In 1976, he began teaching urban education in the Yale 
Residential College Seminar Program. The course is one of his 
many ties to Yale; in addition to coordinating the International 
Studies program with Yale faculty, he invites Yale students of 
various ethnic backgrounds to address the Ethnoliterature 
class. "I like to work on the cutting edge between the high 
school and the university," he says. While he believes that Yale 
faculty and undergraduates help the New Haven public 
schools immensely, he complains that Yale does not do its 
share at the institutional level to improve relations with the 
community. Several years ago, when Saxon was teaching in a 
joint Yale-New Haven college preparatory program, the
