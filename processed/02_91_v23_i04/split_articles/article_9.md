The basketball rivalry between Wilbur Cross and Hillhouse is as 
intense as the familiar one between the lakers and the Celtics. 

Five hundred fans packed Southern Connecticut State 
University's basketball stadium this January for the semi-
annual men's game between Wilbur Cross and Hillhouse 
High Schools. Both teams rank consistently among the top 
basketball powers in the state; last year the Hillhouse 
Academics beat the Cross Governors in the finals of the state 
championship. Although neither team is likely to make the 
finals this year, their match two weeks ago was a thriller. 

In the opening minutes Hillhouse kept the edge, but 
Cross managed to stay close, never falling behind more than 
three points. Midway through the first quarter, the Governors 
took the upper hand, widening their lead w 13 points. In the 
final minutes of the half_ Hillhouse surged to within eight 
Â·points, but never managed to take the lead. The Governors 
blew the Academics away in the final quarter, winning by 12 _ 
points. The New Haven school system's version of the 
Lakers-Celtics game was over. 

Sal Savo, assistant supervisor of athletics for the N~w 
Haven public schools, believes the city's basketball teams are 
successful because the game itself is inexpensive and easily 
accessible. Children can learn the sport even without lessons 
or equipment, although Boys and Girls Clubs throughout the 
city offer organized basketball programs. New H aven 
children learn to play ball not from coaches, but from pick-up 
games on neighborhood courts or in the clubs. For many of 
the players on the Hillhouse women's team, high school 
marks the first time they have played organized ball. 

As New Haven kids get older, basketball becomes more 
important to their futures. In the past 25 years, Cross has sent 
110 basketball players on to college. Cross and Hillhouse 
graduates now attend such powerful basketball schools as 
Lasalle and Louisiana State University. Some of these players, 
however, may not have been academically prepared for 
college. Maurice Williamson, a Cross graduate attending LS'I,.J, 
was ineligible to play this year because of academic problems. 

In response to cases like this one, the New Haven Athletic 
Department has established supplementary academic 
programs for its athletes. 

Five years ago, Bob Laemet Supervisor of Athletics for

New Haven's public schools, institUted a tutorial program to 
give athletes extra help. Teachers tutor athletes so they can 
keep up their grades and remain eligible to play. Failing 
students are not allowed to participate in sports. 

Still, athletes often find the tutorials inadequate. 
"Teachers don't always make you do what you're supposed to 
do," said Terry Brookshire, a junior basketball player at Cross. 
"But you can get help if you ask for it yourself." Hillhouse 
basketball player Dorheen Towles said the tutorial often 
seems more like a social hour than a study session. "The 
tutorial program gives us time to do work and to get help 
from teachers if we need 
it, but it is sometimes 
distracting because there 
are so many people there." 

But 
Paul Goglia, 
history teacher at Cross 
and former director of the 
tutorial program, thinks 
the study sessions are 
productive. "Any athlete

believes they cannot sufficiently address academic problems 
which begin before the players reach high school. He suggests 
that schools use basketball as an educational tool not only for 
secondary school students but for young children as well. 

One new program, Biddy-Basketball, combines education 
with basketball for 162 public school children aged four 
through 12. Directed by high school coaches, the program 
brings children to Hillhouse on Saturday mornings. Hillhouse 
students provide both academic and athletic training for the 
children. An Assistant Basketball Coach at Cross and Biddy-
Basketball coordinator, Tom Fleming, believes that having

able to use this time more efficiently." 

Although the tutorial program is available to all athletes, 
the basketball teams have created their own programs. Jim 
Wolf, head coach of the Hillhouse men's team, invited Yale 
student athletes who tutor in the Branch program to teach a weekly 
Scholastic Aptitude Test review for his players. The review 
improves athletes' chances of college acceptance and also 
addresses Proposition 48, the National Collegiate Athletic 
Association regulation which requires a minimum combined 
SAT score of 700 to play varsity sports in the first year of 
college. Terell Myers, a Hillhouse junior, thinks his SAT scores 
will rise because of the review. Branch d irector David 
Coleman (BR '91) hopes that improvements in the basketball 
players' test scores will encourage other coaches to try similar 
programs. 

While Bob Salisbury, the Cross men's basketball coach, 
thinks these programs are steps in the right direction, he 
already works as an educational tool; at the very least it keeps 
them in school. Laemel claims that while the drop-out rate in 
New Haven is approximately 20 percent, only two percent of 
student athletes quit school. Moreover, the discipline that 
coaches like Salisbury demand on the court spills over into 
classroom behavior. "The basketball players have always been 
some of the best-behaved students in my class, and their 
grades are often as good or better than the class average," 
Goglia said. Teenagers love basketball and are willing to 
abide by the academic and disciplinary rules required to play. 
"Rules don't bother me," said Cross senior Emanuel 
Williamson. "I'm playing something I like."
