funds and rehired the eleven staff

"All responsible people agree that 
the school system is underfunded, but 
Dow's tactics can't be condoned," says 
Einhorn. "He's essentially declared war 
on the city, and everybody loses. The 
taxpayers lose, the students lose." 

Carrano believes the annual tensions 
have degenerated into pettiness. "It's 
unfortunate that we are reduced to 
squabbling," he says. Dow is frustrated 
as well. "It's probably the greatest waste 
of my time every year," he says. "I 
spend nine months messing around 
with the politicians about the budget." 

A few years ago, Dow made 
matters worse by refurbishing school 
board offices. The furniture reportedly 
cost around $200,000. "He lost a lot of 
credibility by putting up an expensive 
set of office furniture when we couldn't 
buy books for the system," says 
Einhorn. 

"He has lost support 
by playing 'hide the 
ball' with finances 
while the city is on the 
verge of bankruptcy." 

Investigators are still looking into 
the matter of the allegedly doctored bills. 
But with four of New Haven's 30 
aldermen calling for his resignation, 
Dow's stock seems to be plunging. 
Although his contract lasts until 1993, the 
superintendent is not untouchable. The 
board in Grand Rapids bought out his 
contract to get him to resign, and city
February 1, 1991 
officials in New Haven could do the same. 
If he is forced to leave, even some 
of those who question Dow's financial 
practices would bemoan the loss. "It's a 
shame because I see all the good things 
he's done. I don't think anybody else 
would have the same drive," says 
parent Susan Sapp. "It's like a passion 
and a vision. I think if he left, the 
district 
would 
slip back 
into 
mediocrity." 

Dow thinks he can survive the 
controversy, and plans to stay on for 
another three to five years. "Wimps 
don't get very far when times get 
tough," he says. "But I only want to be 
superintendent as long as people who 
have children in the school system and 
the staff and students want me to be." 

Some people are already speculating 
that Dow will not last long. "I think he 
might have exhausted his stay here," 
says Sapp. Other parents echo her 
opinion. "I think his time is about up," 
says Edgewood PTA's Barbara Pynn. 

Cool under the collar, Dow tries to 
dispel rumors that the latest scandal 
will mark his downfall. "All that's 
hype," he says. The superintendent 
believes that city officials are just trying 
to get revenge for the annual budget 
fracases. "I've been through this sort of 
thing for a long while-I've been 
misappropriating funds and getting 
fired for five years now," he says with a 
wry smile. "I don't know of any 
minority who has misappropriated 
funds and not wound up in jail. Now 
I'm not in jail yet so I think that says 
something."
