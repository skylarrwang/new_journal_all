Tomorrow's Teachers Today 
Sally Horchow 
Edith MacMullen, director of Yale's 
Teacher Preparation program, is not 
interested in armchair philosophers. 
"We want to link the ideal with the 
real," she said. "We don't sit and discuss 
education in the ivory tower." As a 
result, Teacher Preparation is the only 
undergraduate 
pre-professional 
program at Yale. To complete the 
program, students must not only take 
theoretical courses like "Schools, 
Communities, and the Teacher" and 
"The Methods of Teaching" but they 
must also student-teach in local public 
high schools. The result: state teacher 
certification for public secondary 
schools. 

Upon completion of the Teacher 
Preparation program, students are 
qualified to teach junior and senior high 
school in the Connecticut public school 
system. Approximately 50 people per 
year complete the program. 

The 
University is also experimenting with a 
pilot Child Development program that 
p repares students interested in 
preschool certification. 

Teacher Prep has been part of the 
undergraduate curriculum for 20 years. 
Still, the program remains small because 
the University hires few professors with 
expertise in the educational process.

commitments to other departments. 

While MacMullen teaches an education 
course in the history department, neither 
the political science nor the economics 
department offers any courses on 
educational policy. The philosophy 
department once sponsored a course in 
educational philosophy, but the 
professor retired, and no one has taken 
over the course. This paucity of classes, 
MacMullen says, is indicative of the 
University's ambivalence towards 
teacher training. "There are people who

say that Yale shouldn't have a teacher 
preparation program at all," she said. 
"They think that anyone can teach." 

Struggling for credibility is nothing 
new for Teacher Prep. Even in the 1950s, 
when Yale offered a graduate degree in 
education-the Master of Arts in 
Teaching (MAT)-University officia~s 
turned up their noses at teacher 
preparation. The University did not 
commit many resources to support the 
program, and MAT administrators had 
to seek outside grants. The MAT, 
instituted to meet a national need for 
teachers after the post war baby boom, 
was phased out in the late 60s. "Yale is 
a research institution devoted to 
developing scholars," MacMullen said. 
"The MAT was there to develop

looks." 
practitioners. People thought that MAT 
students weren't as good." Teacher Prep 
re-emerged in 1970 as an undergraduate 
program. MacMullen argues that by 
moving 
the 
program 
to 
undergraduate level, the University did 
future teachers a favor. 

Today's Teacher Prep is stronger 
because its undergraduate program 
balances practice with theory. The 
"Methods" course, for example, 
introduces theoretical approaches to 
classroom situations. Students in the 
program apply what they have learned 
when they teach for ten weeks in a 
Connecticut public school. "When 
someone brought a neat idea to the 
methods class, I could immediately go 
and try it, " said Jeff Carroll (TO '90), a 
graduate of the program. By the same 
toleen, students inject hard facts into

methodological discussions. "I could 
say, 'Well, this is the way it really 
happened today. This is real life,"' 
Carroll said. 

Experienced "master teachers'~ 
advise Carroll and other Teacher Prep 
students. But ins.ide the classroom, 
Yalies are on their own. "My master 
teacher was in class with me only if I 
asked her to be there," Carroll said. 
"But most of the time I faced the class 
alone." 

Marilyn Szwed, the coordinator of 
practice teaching, is in charge of finding 
master teachers to participate in the 
program, often a formidable task. Last 
year, the Connecticut Assembly passed 
legislation that required special training 
for all master teachers. ·Because teachers 
must sacrifice time outside of school for 
this training, few have volunteered. 
"There are some marvelous teachers out 
there who are not certified to be master 
teachers," MacMullen said. 

What's more, two other area 
schools-the University of Southern 
Connecticut and Albertus Magnus-also 
have students who want to practice-
teach. There simply are not enough 
master teachers in New Haven to go 
around. Most of the certified master 
teachers are located in suburban 
schools, another problem for Yale 
students without transportation. Carroll, 
for example, had difficulty locating a 
nearby certified master teacher in social 
studies nearby. Szwed eventually found 
one at North Haven High School, but 
Carroll had to borrow a car to get there 
each day. 

Graduates of Teacher Prep have 
even more difficulty finding permanent 
jobs. Although people may think that 
the United States can always use more 
teachers, hiring in public schools today 
is actually very limited. Job openings 
attract masses of applicants. It was not 
easy for Lucija Begonja, a Special 
Student who graduated from the 
program last year, to find work. Begonja 
sought public school employment for 
months but ended up at St. Mary's, a 
Catholic girl's school in New Haven. 
"Teaching is my top priority," said 
Begonja. "But there is so much 
bureaucracy and politics that you have 
to deal with in the public schools." The 
public schools do not hire until August, 
while private schools begin recruiting in

February. 

After finally finding a job, Begonja 
faced conflicts with colleagues who 
were not prepared in the same way that 
she was. "They've been trained, but they 
haven't been challenged," she said. 

Begonja finds it interesting that most of 
the teachers stick to uninspiring 
multiple choice tests, a method that she 
has never considered. "Edie and 
Marilyn pushed us to be creative and 
made the program special. Even today, 
when I have my crises in the classroom, 
I caU up Marilyn and ask 'What should I 
do?"' 

The graduates of Teacher Prep feel 
ready for these crises. In the classrooms 
of MacMullen and Szwed and in the 
classrooms of Connecticut public 
schools during their practice teaching, 
they have learned to challenge and be 
challenged. "I am always trying new 
methods to see what works best with 
what group of kids," said Begonja. "I am 
growing as a teacher."
