Tutoring groups are puUing Yale students In touch with kids from New Haven middle schools. 
Hillhouse High School junior Alisa 
Reed wanted to boost her grades in 
chemistry and English. For extra help, 
she turned to Branch, a tutoring 
program founded in 1989 by Yale 
students. One of the tutors assigned to 
Reed is white, the other African-
American, like Reed. "Both of them are 
really helpful, and I'm comfortable with 
them," she said. "But we talk about 
different stuff together." Reed's African-
American tutor attended a high school 
similar to Hillhouse and talks to Reed 
about what it's like to go to a 
predominantly white college. Still, Reed 
doesn't think that race plays a big role 
in her relationships with her tutors. "I 
don't think about whether they're white 
or black when I'm with either of them," 
she said "I just think about how they're 
helping me." 

Other Yale groups that work with 
New Haven children wonder how racial 
differences between tutor and student 
affect the educational process. At the 
Ulysses S. Grant Foundation, where 
Yale students teach classes in English 
and math on campus for talented sixth 
through ninth graders, charges that 
white teachers lacked racial sensitivity 
provoked a major upheaval last spring. 
The organization's board of directors 
almost suspended classes when its 
counseling department and assistant 
director walked out in protest. 

The indignant counseling staff, 
made up entirely of students of color, 
believed that they were the only staff 
members who paid sufficient attention 
to racial and class issues. "We felt that 
the teachers were not adequately 
responding to the needs of the students 
they were trying to teach," said Billy 
Ray Gonzalez (PC '91), the assistant 
director who led the walk-out. "They 
refused to see that dealing with issues 
of race and class is central." 

Gonzalez thinks that Yale students 
need intensive sensitivity training 
before they can teach effectively. Grant 
seems to have taken his words to heart. 
Last summer, then-program director 
Jeff Dolven (CC '90) asked teaching 
candidates questions about how they 
would handle racial tensions in class. 
For the first time, Grant leaders ran 
workshops about racial, ethnic and class 
differences, and its present staff is more 
racially diverse than before. "This was 
the 'consciousness year,"' said new 
teacher Crystal Marie Smith (DC '93). 
"The workshops were a good start 
because they admitted that you might 
encounter problems just because you 
are white." 

Still, Dolven refuses to accept the 
possibility that white teachers do more 
harm than good. "At its best, Grant 
provides an environment where the 
dignity of the individual is part of day-
to-day life," he said. "Differences are 
honored but not perceived as divisive." 

Dolven recognizes that Yale students 
may fall short of meeting these ideals. 
"Few undergraduates can really work 
through issues of racial consciousness 
with a group of junior high kids," he 
said. 

While other Yale tutoring groups-
Branch, Youth Together, and Urban 
-Improvement Corps-have not faced 
the upheaval that disrupted U. S. Grant, 
each group has .shaped its own 
philosophy on the role of race in 
education. Youth Together, structured 
around independent projects for. 
students at the Roberto Clemente 
Middle School, tries to select a group of 
tutors that reflects Yale's racial and 
class composition. "The kids are used to 
the mainstream white culture," said 
current director Margaret Etienne (MC 
'91). "But it's important for them to see 
people who look different from each 
other working together as equals." 

Eighth-graders Jose Candelario 
and Kimberly Smart say that their 
images of white people have changed 
since they joined Youth Together. 
"There are only five white kids in this 
school, and none in my neighborhood," 
said Smart. "Until I started working 
with my tutor, most of what I thought 
about them came from negative images 
on TV." Candelario thinks that the 
program makes cooperation seem more 
attractive. "It shows us that you can 
work with white people, and that 
segregation is not the right thing," he 

Candelario's tutor, David Pepper 
(BK '93), says his work in the program 
has made talking about race easieÂ·r. 
"Last year I shied away from even 
saying the word 'black' to someone of 
color," Pepper said. "But I talk about 
race all the time with my student and
