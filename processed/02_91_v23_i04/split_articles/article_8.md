with the minority tutors." 

Other programs also hope to break 
down stereotypes. Hillhouse chemistry 
teacher Lise Orville believes Branch 
proves eye-opening for tutors. "It's 
important for Yalies to know what the 
community they live in is really like 
rather than just being scared by it," she 
said. David Coleman (BR '91), Branch's 
founder, hopes that tutors will leave 
prejudices behind when they enter 
Hillhouse doors. "There is a danger of 
tutors bringing in preconceived notions 
about how Hillhouse students behave," 
he said. "It is u~terly important to 
respond to them as individuals." 

While Branch may encourage 
tutors 
to 
go 
beyond 
cultural 
stereotypes, the program also helps 
dispel Hillhouse kids' misconceptions 
about Yale students. Art tutor Dan 
Clarke (CC '93) remembers that kids 
first assumed he owned a car. Youth 
Together's Etienne believes that as an 
African-American woman, she can 
change student assumptions about who 
goes to Yale. "At first the kids don't 
believe I go to Yale, because for them 
it's a place where African-Americans 
work in the dining halls," she said. 

Monica Simmons (MC '91), director 
of the Urban Improvement Corps (UIC), 
a tutoring program that operates out of 
the Afro-American Cultural Center, 
believes that African-American tutors 
give students a sense of their potential. 
'Tm happy that we have a lot of 
African-American tutors because the 
tutees are people of color in need of 
positive role models," said Simmons. 
She also believes that the bond of race 
gives tutors of color a head start. 
"Students may not take as long to warm 
up to us because race is something very 
visible they can identify with," she said. 

Indeed, Youth Together participant 
Smart recalls that the first time she met 
her white tutor, she felt put off. "I left 
the room," said Smart. "I thought I 
w ouldn't like working with a white 
tutor." Smart changed her mind by the 
end of the first session. "Now I really 
like her," said Smart. 

UIC's Simmons maintains that as 
February 1, 1991 
an African-American tutor, she is more 
in tune with her students. "I can relate 
to the student's fa m ily or school 
situation," she said. Still, former Grant 
Assistant Director Gonzalez feels that 
the common bond of race does not 
guarantee sensitivity. "To be successful, 
Yale students of color require the same 
training as white students do in 
respecting differences," he said. 

Although Branch does not yet have 
an official training session, Coleman is 
wary of providing too much training 
before students begin tutoring. "We 
don't want to saddle them with huge 
generalizations about what it means to 
be an inner-city kid," he said. Still, 
Coleman realizes that tutors need some 
preparation. "We don't want our tutors 
to go in with any illusions about how 
difficult some of the skill problems and 
family problems are," he said. 

UIC tutor Adria Imada (DC '93) 
often wishes that her training had 
included more information about the 
environment in which her students live. 
"Kids come in talking about violent 
situations at home or in their 
neighborhood," 
she 
said. 
" I'm 
frustrated because I don't have the 
knowledge or resources to help." 

When tutors meet with students, 
what goes unsaid may be the most 
telling of all. Last fall, while helping out 
in an art class, Branch tutor Clarke 
noticed one student creating a graphic 
design that incorporated the words: 
"Blacks and Whites Unite." " I was 
really impressed with the design, and I 
told him so," said Clarke. "But I felt it 
was inappropriate for me to ask him 
about the social implications of that 
slogan." 

While Clarke and other Yale 
students struggle to define their role as 
tutors within New Haven schools, 
chemistry teacher Orville believes their 
academic function is paramount. 
"Helping the kids with their work is the 
meat of what tutors do, and anything 
else is pure gravy," she said.
