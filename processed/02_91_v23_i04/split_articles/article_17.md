John Dow Sounds Off

When Dow took over in 1984, he wasted 
"' no time overhauling some of New Haven's 
~ most feared schools. Calling New Haven the 
~ "cesspool of educational impersonation," he 
~ fired a number of administrators, enforced 
~ strict disciplinary rules-evell prohibiting 
students from wearing hats in school-and 
demanded that parents c.Qme to orientations 
before their children could enroll in classes. 
He ordered copy machines and other basic 
· materials the schools lacked. "We wanted 
kids to improve in their subjects and we · 
didn't have books, didn't have paper," he 
recalls with disgust. "We didn't have 
furniture and didn't have copy machines."' 
Since then, Dow has boosted parental 
involvement in the schools, beefed up special 
education programs, instituted social 
development curricula, and enlisted 
corporate sponsorship for school programs. 
"I try to operate in this school district as if every decision I make is for my own 
child," said Superintendent of Schools John Dow. 
He has brought computers into all 
classrooms through the fifth grade, introduced advanced 
placement classes, funded college visits for high school 
seniors, and schmoozed for grant money to send students 
abroad. "If you name it, he has done it," says ]effie Frazier, 
principal of Helene Grant elementary school. 
"Sometimes people may think that I shoot from the hip," says 
John Dow, Jr., Superintendent of the New Haven Public 
Schools. 
He's got that much right. "He tends to shoot from the 
hip and when you do that you tend to create some level of 
controversy," says Frank Carrano, president of the New 
Haven Teachers Union. Now that controversy may be 
spinning out of control. In December, Education Department 
clerk Joanne Bivona resigned and then accused Dow of telling 
her to stay quiet about bills allegedly doctored by school 
officials. She says Dow promised her a promotion in 
exchange for her silence. When Mayor Daniels called a 
meeting with the school board to discuss the issue, no one 
showed up. Daniels accused the board of deliberately 
snubbing him and Dow publicly called the mayor "a damn 
liar." 
"Dr. Dow does things to get people's attention," says 
Edward Ferruci, principal of Martin Luther King elementary 
school. "He reminds me of George Patton. He's a fighter." 


Dow's aggressive approach has gotten results. Educators 
and parents recall the dismal conditions of the New Haven 
school system before he arrived. "Before Dow came here, the 
schools were out of control, " says Susan Sapp, a parent with 
three children in district schools. "Kids were running around 
and the doors of classrooms used to be locked with students 
inside." Parents were desperate for improvement. "People's

the classroom, he advanced to the administrative level, 
serving a year as a middle school assistant principal. From 
there, his career rocketed and within eight years of his first 
teaching job, Dow had become an assistant superintende~t. 
By the time he was 38 years old, Dow had landed in the 
Grand Rapids superintendent's office. 
The superintendent came to New Haven after the school 
board in Grand Rapids asked him to step down amid 
allegations of financial indiscretion. The board accused Dow 


of mishandling expense accounts and using school funds for 
personal use. Although the board brought no criminal 
charges against Dow, the distrustful community essentially 
gave him the boot. "Things started escalating," says Maryanne 
Challa, teacher in Grand Rapids and former Board of 
Education member. "People thought that Dow wasn't doing 
his job and there were allegations that he misused funds. It 
served the best interests of the community and John that he 
stepped down." New Haven Board of Education members 
traveled to Michigan before hiring Dow and decided that he 
was treated unfairly as a victim of media sensationalism and 
school board mistrust in Grand Rapids. 
When he came to New Haven, Dow moved from a school 
district of more than 54,000 students to a district of 18,000 
students here. "Right off the top his tactics were offensive," 
says John Einhorn, Alderman from the 25th Ward. Within the 
first few months of his tenure, Dow demoted an assistant 
superintendent and fired several other high-level 
administrators. "I told the board that we're going to hire 
people that are going to be effective, and we're going to fire 
people who are not," says Dow. Although one of the fired 
administrators took Dow to court on charges of 
discrimination, local residents viewed the firings as a good 
move. "He shocked a very staid, sluggish system," says 
Barbara Pynn, co-president of the Edgewood elementary 
school Parent-Teacher Association. "He got rid of a lot of dead 
wood." 


In 1985, Dow caused an uproar within the medical 
community and among AIDS activists when he barred a five-
year-old child with AIDS from coming to school. Rumors 
spread that Dow wanted to banish children with the disease to 
basement schools. Dow claims he acted out of caution and the 
ignorance of the times. "There were all kinds of wild stories 
about how AIDS could be contracted," Dow says. 'We were 
trying to be more safe than sorry." Although most board 
members backed him up on his decision, a 1988 federal court 
order prohibited school districts from denying HN carriers 
their right to an education. 


More recently, Dow proposed that officials withhold 
welfare checks from parents who did not send their children 
to school. Dow attributes many of the district's educational 
difficulties to low attendance rates in the schools. This year, 
for example, 28 percent of the fourth graders who failed the 
state mastery test had missed 20 or more days of school. "You 
can't blame teachers when children don't come to school," 
says Dow. "That's negligent parenting." While Dow hoped 
the welfare proposal would force increased attendance, the 
community expressed some misgivings. Dow thinks these 
objections were off the mark. "Hell, I get arguments from the


liberal do-gooders who suggest that having your kid miss 40 
days of school is all right," he says. 


Although Dow hopes to make parents more accountable 
for the education of their children, he believes the schools 
must assume a role he calls "institutional parenting." Under 
his guidance the schools have started serving free breakfasts 
and lunches, and students can stay after school for an

extended day academy. As he continues to add such 
programs, Dow takes the philosophy of "institutional 
parenting" very personally. "I try to operate in this school 
district as if every decision I make is for my own child," he 
says. 


Like any savvy leader, Dow knows when to give a little. 
By paying the city's teachers more money, he has cultivated 
faculty support for his initiatives. 'Without a superintendent 
leading the movement to improve teacher salaries, we would 
still be one of the lowest-paid districts in the state," says John 
Courtmanche, principal of Wilbur Cross High School. Faculty 
are relieved to have the superintendent on their side. "That's 
a refreshing change," says Rhoda Spear, supervisor of both 
the city-wide Talented and Gifted Program and the English 
curriculum for grades nine through 12. ''You usually meet a 
superintendent as an adversary across the bargaining table." 


Dow has also given the city's teachers at least a little 
more power. He supports teachers in their efforts to institute 
School Planning and Management Teams, which decentralize 
authority in the schools. At each school, a team made up of 
teachers, parents and the prinicipal would decide how to run 
the school. "Dow has supported it, which has been important 
because this kind of change can only happen if there's 
support from top to bottom," says Carrano. 


While supporting faculty concerns, Dow nevertheless 
makes high demands on his staff and comes down hard on 
anyone who tries to slack off. "If we don't do our jobs he can 
be a mean SOB," says Martin Luther King principal Ferruci. 
Dow doesn't let himself off the hook either. School board 
members report that the superintendent often works late into 
the night, though he frequently forgets that not everyone 
works on the same schedule. Former school board member 
and current City Comptroller Peter Halsey reports that Dow 


made regular calls to board members as late as 3:00 in the

morning. "He would just assume you 
were sitting there waiting for his call," 
says Halsey. "That's just part of his 
style. He's intense." 


Yet Dow's intensity has disgruntled 
city officials, particularly during annual 
budget battles with the city. Dow has 
locked horns with former Mayor Biagio 
DiLieto and present Mayor John Daniels 
in a series of much-publicized disputes,

often characterized by name-calling and 
accusations of financial impr_opriety. 


In his most recent clash with the 
city, Dow has claimed that New Haven 
failed to meet educational funding 
requirements manCfated by the state. 
He has demanded that the city come up 
with the cash. While the state supports 
Dow's claim that New Haven should -
add $2 million to its educational budget, 
city officials claim Dow could meet state 
guidelines by transferring funds from 
non-essential programs to those 
mandated by the state. "It is absolutely 
clear that the school system could meet 
the state requirement under the current 
budget," says Halsey. 


City officials claim that Dow uses 
suspect accounting practices. "John 
Dow has never produced an honest or 
straightforward budget," says Steven 
Mednick, a New Haven attorney and 
president pro tempore of the Board of 
Aldermen. Dow opponents accuse the 
superintendent of refusing to be fiscally 
accountable. "He has lost support by 
playing 'hide the ball' with finances 
while the city is on the verge of 
bankruptcy," says Alderman Einhorn. 


Dow, however, says that city 
officials are using New Haven's 
financial crisis to excuse its failure to 
meet the state funding requirements. 
"I'm not asking the city for more 
money, I'm asking it to meet the law," 
says Dow. The superintendent sought 
to 
dramatize 
the situation by 
eliminating eleven teaching positions 
one week before school started last 
September. But the move generat~d 
more antagonism for Dow than 
sympathy for the schools' economic 
woes, and two weeks later the 
superintendent evidently reallocated
