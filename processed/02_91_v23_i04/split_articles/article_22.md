Education en Vogue 
Strike a pose, there's nothing to it 
Education is clearly in. Both the flood of 
articles and the rash of TV shows-not 
"crises." 
Performance 
budgeting, 
accountability, community control, 
school-based management, and teacher 
empowerment are policy slogans that 
have been successively, but not successfully, adopted over the past ten years 
alone. Cooperative learning is now the 
rage, replacing the fad for grouping of a 
to mention registration in Yale classes-
give proof of the passionate public concern for our country's schools and for 
the quality of education available for our 
future workers and voters. But the current 
discussion suffers from certain 
habitual national weaknesses: our lack of 
an historical perspective, our propensity 
for faddism and our yearning for the 
quick fix, our preference for constant, 
agonized criticism over sustained commitment and consistent action, and, 
most crucial of all, our inability to recognize and to accept our ambivalence 
about goals for education. We simply do 
not ask the hard questions often enough; 
nor do we examine proposed solutions 
with a vigilant eye. 


Historians often describe cycles in 
American history. In the discourse on 
education, the pendulum swings 
between vacillation and commitment. 
Each generation must rediscover the 
wheel of misfortune in the history of 
schooling. Johnny could not read in the 
'60s, and Joanne can neither read nor calculate in the '90s. The antebellum 
reformers decried the lack of academic 
preparation among beginning teachers; 
today's students in education courses 
are reported to have the lowest 
Scholastic Aptitude Test scores of any 
group of pre-professional registrants. 
Benjamin Franklin attacked the traditional 
grammar schools because they 
prepared young men only for specific 
and limited roles, and progressives in 
the '20s had the same criticism of high 
schools. 


Still, parents, principals, and policy 
makers alike bemoan the passing of the 
golden age of schools, a time when students trooped eagerly to class in search 
of truth and willingly followed every 
suggestion of respected adults. In fact, 
as fiction and biography amply demonstrate, that golden age never existed. In 
the 19th century, schools were in session 
for far shorter periods of time. Children 
attended with appalling irregularity. 
Less than half the youngsters between 
the ages of 14 and 17 were enrolled in 
high school in 1930, and the majority of 
the boys who began high school soon 
withdrew. This caused the much discussed "boy problem" (an aspect of 
which was that girls did so much better 
in school than boys) which led to curricular reorganization and "reform." That 
reform was partially responsible for a 
tracking and guidance apparatus which 
systematically slotted children into niches purportedly suitable to their class, origin, and destiny. (This of course persists 
although with less blatant justification.) 
And whether the source was Ichabod 
Crane or the Lynds' Middletown, teachers 
were more frequently the object of 
ridicule than respect. 


Even when we admit that the evidence indicates that our schools are not 
as effective as we would like and refuse 
to admit that societal conditions may 
contribute to their weaknesses, we constantly look for quick solutions to 
few years past. Some ten years ago 
a Connecticut adopted a law that provided for forgiveable loans (with the splendid acronym ELEET) to undergraduates 
who entered teacher training programs 
and taught for three years in the state. 
The law was repealed two years later 
because it was deemed ineffective-
although the students who had received 
the loans were still in college. No medical advance would be judged on such 
short term and undocumented research. 


Faddism and unexamined assumptions are characteristic of so many of the 
"expert" reports issued since 1983's 
Nation at Risk. One reason is overlapping membership among the panels that 
author them; Albert Shanker has been a 
busy man this decade. Similar conclusions have led to similar legislative and 
regulatory activity-teacher qualifications and high school graduation 
requirements throughout the fifty states 
have come closer and closer to a national 
standard without federal action (and 
that, of course, would violate one of the 
shibboleths of educational dogma, local 
control). Yet there is not a smidgeon of 
conclusive evidence that any one of the 
reforms will work better than last year's. 


Practitioners in the field must share 
the blame. Educators may be among the 
most conservative of all professionals. 
Most went into the field because they 
enjoyed their own schooling and were 
comfortable in a familiar environment; 
they teach and administer the way they 
know. Too often, when given an opportunity to participate in decisions and to 
right the wrongs they attack, teachers 


have proven cowardly. A skilled superintendent in this state proposed that the 
teachers in his district run a school. He 
was willing to seek legislative waivers 
for stringent regulations, but he had no 
takers. No one was willing to take the 
risk. It was easier to complain. 


It is comfortable and certainly correct to be aware and to express concern-to read Fred Hechinger in the 
Times or listen to John Chancellor deliver 
bites of insight. Evidence of commitment can be volunteering in a school-
until reading week or until it gets too 
discouraging-or teaching at Ulysses S. 
Grant for a term. Two years as a Teach 
for America beginner or in a private 
school are possibilities before getting on 
with the real business of life. Last year 
less than 20 Yale undergraduates prepared themselves for positions in the 
public schools, those objects of national 
condemnation. But of course, who 
would go to Yale only to become a 
teacher? 


All of this must sound suspiciously 
like an unjust tirade, and it is unfair to 
the many, many dedicated and unsung 
students, researchers, and teachers, here 
at Yale and throughout the country, who 
struggle day by day, quarter by quarter, 
board meeting after board meeting, for 
the cause of schooling. But they also suffer under practices and philosophies 
that go unexamined, but accepted. Who 
decided that learning should be presented in 36 or 48 or 52 minute segments? 
Who decided that geometry had to come 
between algebra I and algebra II? Why 
do you have to be five to go to kindergarten? Or 18 to go to college? Is 18 the 
optimum number for a seminar and 25 
for a high school history class? These 
are obvious and easy questions; what 
about who should go to college and 
what does a high school diploma mean 
anyway? 


There are enormous and unadmitted disagreements about the direction 
education should take in the next decade 
or century. These revolve around precisely the same questions that were 
debated by Horace Mann and the school 
masters of Boston, by Charles Eliot and 
the classics teachers in 1893, by Admiral 
Rickover and the progressives in their 
last gasp, and now by Allan Bloom and 
the curriculum specialists advocating a 
multicultural curriculum. The issues 
have to do with whether our schools 
should be inclusive or exclusive, 
whether our courses of study should be 
liberal or vocational, theoretical or pragmatic, whether we include moral and 
social goals or attempt to concentrate on 
more purely conceptual ones. And how 
should we evaluate the success or failure 
(we always want things simple) of our 
educational endeavor? SAT scores? 
Student standing in international math 
competitions? Or perhaps athletic competitions, given the money spent on 
sports? Yet one British researcher proposed job retention rates rather than O-
level scores as a better measure of school 
effectiveness. The point remains: what 
measures do we value? 


Searching discussions about educational matters are not comfortable, for 
they may reveal the true failure of our 
educational policy and system-the fact 
that the reality is so removed from the 
rhetoric. The possibility of lasting 
renewal in educational institutions is in 
doubt-unless committed participants 
stay the course.
