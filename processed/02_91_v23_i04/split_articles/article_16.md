;;; School introduced dramatic policy 
f changes that will transform the face of 
~ graduate education at Yale. Above all, 
... 
::;: these changes reflect the two deans' 
sense that across the country, there is a 
crisis in graduate education. Simply put, 
graduate school takes too long. 
Graduate studentsÂ· at Yale current-
ly take an average of eight years to com-
plete a Ph.D.-less than the national 
average, but over a year longer than in 
the 1970s. "A red light went on when 
the figure went up to eight years," said 
Pollitt. "I just don't see the need to keep 
anyone captive for more than six." 
Kagan noted that educators nationwide 
believe graduate school wastes both 
time and money. "There is a concern 
that money is being thrown down a 
rathole," Kagan said. "Why should the 
Ph.D. be limitless?" 
The Kagan-Pollitt plan is shaped 
by the 1989 findings of the Ad Hoc 
Committee on Teaching at Yale College, 
headed by Jules Prown, professor of art 
history. 
Following 
the 
Prown 
Committee' s conclusion that excessive 
teaching responsibilities interfere with 
graduate work, the deans cut 200 of 
Yale's 1000 teaching assistant positions. 
''The focus of education ought to be tilt-
ed back toward the faculty," said Robert 
Bunselmeyer, associate dean of the 
graduate school. "We hope that faculty 
will become more involved in teaching 
sections themselves." 


To compensate for lost T A salaries, 
the Kagan-Pollitt plan called for a 
Dissertation Fellowship Program to 
award $8000 stipends to fifth- and sixth-
year graduate students. But the plan 
also ensures that the sixth year will be 
the students' last. Overstepping the 
Prown Committee's suggestions to 
speed up graduate education, the 
Kagan-Pollitt plan demands that stu-
dents complete their programs on 
schedule or risk losing course credit. 
Previously, students could negotiate 
due dates for late course work, but now 
they have one month to finish incom-
plete credits. "The deans have put more 
emphasis on stick as well as carrot mea-
sures," said Rogers Smith, Prown 
Committee membe-r and professor of 
political science. 

While many professors applauded 
the Prown report, they think Kagan and 
Pollitt went too far. "The plan's deci-
sions were imposed entirely without ref-
erence to faculty concerns," said Nancy 
Cott, Director of Graduate Studies for 
American Studies. Contrary to the two 
deans' expectations, professors say T A 
cuts won't make the faculty teach more. 
"There' s nothing structural in the plan 
that requires them to do so,"said 
William Cronon, DGS for the history 
department. "The faculty have no room 
to be doing more teaching." 

If graduate students teach less and 
faculty cannot teach more, undergradu-
ate education will deteriorate. This 
semester, undergrads face capped lec-
ture classes, larger sections, and less 
individual attention from TA's. "I'm just 
appalled about how this is affecting sec-
tion sizes," said History TA Heidi 
Tinsman (GRD '95). 

Equally worrisome are the plan's 
effects on graduate education. Students 
say they receive insufficient faculty 
guidance to finish within six years. "You 
have to have someone work with you 
very closely to finish that quickly," said 
Jeanne Lawrence (GRD '92). Because the 
Kagan-Pollitt plan does not increase fac-
ulty involvement in the graduate school, 
students fear their research will suffer. 
"People's research may not be rigorous 
enough to compete in the job market," 
said Renee White (GRD '93). "Everyone 
is really nervous about the six-year cut-
off," said Tinsman. 

While graduate students insist the 
six-year cap is unrealistic, Kagan and 
Pollitt seem to think that all the gradu-
ate students need is a new attitude. "My 
primary concern is helping graduate 
students finish rather than lead a kind of 
gypsy life in New Haven," said Pollitt. 
Grads respond that the deans don' t 
understand their position. "The deans 
seem to think that we have a welfare

ing a good time." 
mentality," said Gordon Lafer (GRD 
'94). "They think we are having a good 
time." 

Some graduate students say that 
the deans have been blinded by their 
desire to save money. Organizations like 
the Mellon Foundation support initia-
tives to speed graduate education, and 
grad students say Kagan and Pollit 
shaped their plan to tap into such funds. 
Pollitt acknowledges that funding con-
cerns played a role. "I wish that there 
was a lot more money that the graduate 
school could hand out," he said. " But 
every penny in our budget has been 
allocated." 

Kagan and Pollitt may have intend-
ed the fellowship program to free grad 
students from financial concerns, but 
money remains an issue. "A freebie at 
the end of five long years doesn't seem 
to be adequate," said Lisa Rabin (GRD 
'92), the only graduate student to serve 
on the Prown committee. "When mak-
ing a living becomes a worry, it inter-
feres with the completion of a degree." 

Students say the absence of teaching 
opportunities coupled with inadequate 
grants has made graduate school inac-
cessible. "People are dropping out 
because they can't afford to be here," 
said 
Mary 
Renda 
(GRD 
'94). 
"Increasingly you have to be from an 
upper-middle class background to sur-
vive in graduate school."

While some students say the deans 
only want to cut corners, others suspect 
that the Yale administration's distrust of 
T A unionization sparked the Kagan-
Pollitt plan. "The plan would never 
have come into existence if the graduate 
students had not organized," said 
Robert Hinton (GRD '91). TAs are 
unionized at several major universities, 
and in recent years graduate students at 
Yale have sought better conditions 
under the auspice of TA Solidarity, a 
nascent union. Las~ April, the group 
changed its name to the Graduate 
Employees and Students Organization 
(GESO) and joined the Federation of 
University Employees-a union that 
"The nature of the dis-
ciplines does have 
something to do with 
it. Some of them have 
faculty members who 
teach them that 
rebellion is a way of 
life. " 
already represents Yale's Clerical and 
Technical workers, and Service and 
Maintainence workers. With the support 
of the other organized workers, GESO 
began a membership drive last spring. 
Hinton says that Kagan and Pollitt 
wanted to stymie this effort, and so 
imposed the six year ceiling on graduate 
education. "Many of the people who 
were organizing were beyond their sixth 
year," said Hinton. "The plan was most-
ly intended to be a threat." 

Pollitt says such accusations are 
unfounded. "There has always been an 
unhappy group-in history, American 
Studies, political science-for whom 
nothing is ever gooci," he said. "It's 
always some trap to defraud them." 

Still, Pollitt says the faculty may be 
responsible for this paranoia. "The 
nature of the disciplines does have 
something to do with it. Some of them 
have faculty members who teach them 
that rebellion is a way of life." 

Accusations of insidious plots 
aside, there is no guarantee that as grad-
uate students teach less, they will com-
plete their studies more quickly. With 
the exception of language degrees, the 
Prown Committee was unable to estab-
lish any correlation between teaching 
and the length of time to complete a 
degree. "We tried hard to find evidence 
for 
a 
correlation," 
Committee member Smith. As a result, 
graduate students claim that because of 
its faulty premise, the Kagan-Pollitt plan 
is illogical and destined to fail. While 
Tinsman says that a shorter time for a 
degree is certainly appealing, she 
believes that it's only wishful thinking. 
"I think that we would all like to finish 
in six years," she said. "I'd like to do it in 
five."
