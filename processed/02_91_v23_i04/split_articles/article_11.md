Speaking the Same Language

When the final bell rings at Hillhouse High 
School, most students beat a hasty retreat 
from their daily studies. But a number of 
sophomores and juniors stay put. This 
group is joined by students from all over 
the New Haven area who are bused to 
Hillhouse four times a week to participate 
in Hillhouse's International Studies 
Program. Picking up where most high 
school language curricula leave off, the 
program offers courses in Chinese, 
Japanese, and Russian. Participants devote 
eight hours a week to conjugating verbs, 
translating passages and memorizing 
dialogues. But hard work has its rewards. 
During the summer, program members 
travel to China, Japan or the Soviet Union to 
practice their newly-acquired language 
skills. 

They live with families, tour 
museums, and journey through the 
countryside. To top it off, the students 
don't have to pay for anything but 
souvenirs. The federal government picks up 
the tab. 

The US Department of Education 
funds International Studies at Hillhouse 
because the program doubles as an 
experiment in voluntary integration. Of the 
1,()20 students who attend Hillhouse during 
school hours, 95.3 are African-American, 51 
are Latino, and 12 are white. In contrast, the 
after-school program is more ethnically 
balanced. Eighteen African-American and 
Latino, 35 white, and 6 Asian students 
participate. Program administrator Edith 
MacMullen says that this balance 1s the 
result of a concerted effort to recruit 
students from schools throughout the New 
Haven area. 

Educators attribute the success of this 
integration experiment to the strength of the 
language instruction. The language classes 
are team-taught by a certified teacher and a 
native speaker. While one explains the 
basics, the other coaches students' accents 
and helps them master idioms. NWith the 
two-teacher system, there is far more 
instruction and flexibility," MacMullen said. 
New Haven Supelintendent of Schools John 
Dow believes the rigor of the program 
explains its success as a tool for mtegration.
