"You can say it's stupid, but I don't have 
to worry about getting killed, or getting 
shot at out of a window," said Joey 
D'Amico, a senior at The New Haven 
Sound School. To escape the violence 
that he thinks pervades the city's tradi-
tional high schools, D'Amico chose the 
Sound School, one of five magnet high

scale. " 
schools. Called "schools of choice," 
these magnets pull 1,500 students from 
all over the city by offering specialized 
academics and close teacher-student 
relations. Their small size and experi-
mental nature provide an alternative to 
large, comprehensive city schools. 

New Haven's schools of choice got 
their start in the late days of the Civil 
Rights movement. The 1970 New Haven 
Black Panther trials and the accompany-
ing school riots forced the public to scru-
tinize the local school system, uncover-
ing severe segregation in New Haven's 
public schools. George Foote, then a 
teacher at Hillhouse High School, 
thought that magnet schools would be 
an innovative solution to public 
demands for reform and voluntary 
desegregation. 

With several other 
Hillhouse teachers, he applied for a state 
grant to start a magnet program in New 
Haven. The first new school opened in 
1971. The program's goal: to give public 
school students the same privileges as 
wealthier kids, in particular the oppor-
tunity to choose one's high school. 


Each school of choice features a 
different "magnet" designed to attract 
students-from humanities at the High 
School in the Community to marine life 
at the Sound School. While recruiters 
encourage students to consider their 
interests before applying, some apply 
just to get out of the comprehensive 
high schools. Many say they are afraid 
of Wilbur Cross and Hillhouse. "My 
mother had heard too many stories of 
violence at Cross. She didn't want to 
find out if they were true," a Sound 
School senior said. Another said he got 
into too many fights at Cross. Lottery 
determines admission to the schools, 
ensuring racial and intellectual diversity. 

Magnet classes feature more 
hands-on activity than their counter-
parts at comprehensive schools. At the 
High School in the Community, individ-
ual classes meet for up to three hours 
each day, allowing time for field trips 
and research in New Haven. Students in 
a law class, for example, attend trials in 
the New Haven courthouse. Members of 
a journalism class conduct interviews in 
their neighborhoods. 

Each magnet school has a core cur-
riculum encompassing subjects such as 
math and English and offers electives 
within its concentration. The Sound 
School, for example, offers only marine 
electives. The optional classes at the 
Cooperative High School center on busi-
ness and computers. 

To keep their brand of teaching 
effective, the magnet schools limit 
enrollment to between 200 and 250 stu-
dents. This size allows teachers to give 
students individual attention. 

Jeff 
Granoff, a science teacher at the Sound 
School, values the closeness of his rela-
tionship with his students. "I teach them 
to develop social skills, and to under-
stand what's going on around them." 

Teachers can stay close to their students. 
They notice if somebody is skipping 
class. If need be, they can even act as 
surrogate parents, helping students 
through emotional crises. When one 
magnet student began missing classes, 
her teachers discovered that she was 
pregnant and offered her counseling. 

But the small-school atmosphere 
has its drawbacks. Some students com-
plain that the schools are too small and 
too insular. Everybody, they say, knows 
everybody else's business. Other stu-
dents miss the school spirit of big high 
schools. Briceida Trujill, student body 
president of the Sound School, com-
plains her school is too small for suc-
cessful school dances or intramural 
sports teams. She wishes the magnet 
schools could be bigger. 

Robert Cannelli, principal of the 
High School in the Community, thinks 
the magnets' small size attracts students 
who are more motivated and involved 
in academics. Ninety percent of High 
School in the Community seniors scored 
higher on the SAT than their peers at 
Cross and Hillhouse. Some teachers, 
however, contest the notion that the 
city's high-achieving children flock to

diversity 
the magnets. Jon Buell, history teacher at 
the Sound School, says that students 
come from a variety of backgrounds. 

Because of their small size and lim-
ited funding, magnets cannot offer all 
the services of comprehensive high 
schools. To cover extra expenses, such as 
boat equipment at the Sound School and 
The New Journal 35 

computers at the Cooperative High 
School, administrators have eliminated 
varsity athletics a nd dramatically 
increased teacher workloads. The cuts 
have left student athletes resentful. 

More importantly, the budget con-
straints and active participation in stu-
dent life spead teachers thin. "I like the 
smallness, which allows us to focus on 
the kids. But sometimes I feel over-
w helmed," explained Anne Solomon, a 
counselor a t the Cooperative High 
School. At the Sound School, instructors 
normally teach four classes although 
their contracts o nly bind them to two. 
And since the electives that magnets 
offer change frequently, faculty mem-
bers must revamp their lesson plans 
each year. An instructor could be teach-
ing maritime history and botany one 
year, world history and marine biology 
the next. 

Cost-cutting measures have kept 
magnet budgets in line with those of 
comprehensive high schools, but some 
parents in the school system still think 
the magnets get too much money. "I 
dislike the fact that some schools are 
chosen to have special programs that are 
super-enriched," said Barbara Pynn, the 
co-president 
of 
the 
Edgewood 
Elementary School's Parent-Teache r 
Association. ''That's not fair. I'd rather 
see the money spent across the board." 

Fair or not, the dollars that go to 
magnet schools get results. More mag-
net students go on to college than their 
comprehens·ive school peers. 

But 
Hillhouse Vice Principal Syd Lillick . 
asserts that the mag11et schools are not · 
necessarily better thar comprehensive 
high schools. "I don't know if they are 
better able to help the kids. They are 
just smaller schools so they have the 
same problems on a smaller scale," she 
said. Teachers at magnet schools point 
out that their students suffer from prob-
lems such as teenage pregnancy and 
drug use. "The magnets a re supposed 
to help the inner-city kids, but they 
don't at all," said Buell. " It's easier in 
theory than in practice." 

Foote, however, believes magnet 
students gain much more than they lose 
by leaving comprehensive high schools 
for small, focused environments. He 
would like the whole education system 
to consist solely of schools of choice. In 
magnet schools, he,~ays, the kids get the 
attention they need and they learn 
things they enjoy. "We~re doing some-
thing they think makes sense," he said. 
"It's rare that we adults ever do that."
