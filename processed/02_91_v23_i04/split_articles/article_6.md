the social histories of the various ethnic 
groups represented in New Haven. In 
the ambitious science program, the 
curriculum includes microbiology and 
physiology. Students use medical-
school case histories, and dissect 
specimens ranging from sharks to cats. 
The foundation pays for high-tech 
laboratory equipment often absent in 
even the most exclusive private schools. 
In addition to providing this 
sparkling equipment, the Macy 
curriculum responds to the particular

parents with a college 
or even a high school 
diploma. " 
social problems that many of these 
students face: drugs, domestic violence, 
and street crime. "Public schools, 
instead of projecting into the future, 
have reacted to crisis," Blosveren said. 
"We have a real crisis going on." 
Last year, tutors from The 
Princeton Review helped Macy juniors 
prepare for the Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
The program's teachers also helped with 
college applications. For many of the 
students, the program makes college 
seem attainable. "Most kids here don't 
have parents with a college or even a 
high school diploma," said Blosveren. In 
the two classes that have graduated, all 
but three students went on to college. 
Despite the outpouring of money 
and effort, returning Macy alumni 
report having difficulty keeping up with 
reading in college. Moreover, the 
students have shown little improvement 
on standardized tests. Macy programs 
in New York, Alabama, and Arizona 
report similarly disappointing scores. 
The sponsor is demanding better 
results, 
especially 
on 
reading 
comprehension tests. "The foundation is 
coming down really hard. They want to 
see them doing so much reading that it 
is coming out of their ears," said 
Blosveren. To meet the foundation's 
demands, 
Hillhouse 
is 
now 
implementing an extensive reading 
program with regular testing for all 
Macy students. 

Such extra attention and money 
spent on Macy students causes 
resentment among some of their non-
Macy classmates, those in the lower 
"honors," "college-level," or "special-ed" 
tracks. A high proportion of Macy 
students lead the school's student 
government, athletic teams, and 
extracurricular organizations. A single 
group of students sticks together in all 
of its Macy classes. This system helps 
the teachers monitor students' 
development and detect problems early. 
It also fosters many close friendships. 
Some people outside the program, 
however, view Macy students as clique-
ish. "The honors and Macy students just 
socialize with each other," said tenth-
grader Chris Santos, who wants to get 
into the Macy program. 

Many Hillhouse teachers, however, 
believe the creation of an academic elite 
"People feel that either 
you are a Macy 
student or you aren't. 
The others feel that 
they are have-nots. " 
is beneficial to the school, making 
achievement socially acceptable. Macy 
recalls the spirit that once christened 
sports 
teams 
"the 
Academics." Administrators note that 
many of the best students join the 
program after their freshman year, 
when they see friends who are in the 
program sticking with it. "I've heard a 
lot of students say that they would like 
to be in the Macy program, so I think it 
serves as an incentive," said Macy 
chemistry teacher Lise Orville. "Kids 
are willing to work a little harder to be 
in Macy." Still, Orville fears that less-
motivated students get the wrong 
message and view their lower academic 
status as inevitable. "I think that we 
haven't been careful enough to say to 
students that they can get into Macy if 
they work very hard. People feel that 
either they are a Macy student or they 
aren't. The others feel that they are the 
have-nots." 

Although sotne Macy students 
come from very poor families, most do 
not. By contrast, the majority of 
Hillhouse parents have incomes near_ 
the poverty line. "A large number of 
Macy students are middle class. A lot of 
professionals-teachers, doctors., or 
nurses-send their kids to Hillhouse," 
said Orville. Although Blosveren claims 
that the Macy program has brought 
more affluent students to Hillhouse, he 
rejects the idea that Macy fosters elitism. 
"They're just a group of students, with 
the same ability as everyone else, who 
are taking advantage of what they 
have." 

Despite the program's uncertain 
results, most of the students believe that 
the Macy name will help them get into 
more prestigious colleges. "A lot of 
them want to be somebody and get out 
of this school," said Terry Bailly, a non-
Macy student. For many Macy students, 
"being somebody" often means 
escaping from New Haven. "A number 
of our Macy graduates visit and say 'I'll 
never come back to New Haven. I'm 
going to get my degree and move on,"' 
Blosveren said. "In the past, with white 
communities, we called it upward 
mobility."
