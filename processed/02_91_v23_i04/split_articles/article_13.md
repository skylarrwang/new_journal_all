Working parents who have no time to fix breakfast can count on the 
schools to feed their children a morning meal. 

Sometimes the juice is frozen or the fruit is not ripe. But the 
25 students in Allison Gouterman's kindergarden class say 
that usually the food tastes good. Each morning before they 
practice reading and math skills, the students at the Isadore 
Wexler Elementary School eat a breakfast provided by the 
New Haven public schools. Only after the students pile their 
cardboard trays in the recycling bin does Gouterman instruct 
them to open their books and begin the lesson of the day. 

This year the New Haven public school system will 
provide breakfast for 76 percent of its elementary and middle 
school students, nearly 10,000 children citywide. Two years 
ago, administrators launched the free breakfast program to 
alleviate hunger among the city's children. Along with

~ only for students' intellectual development, but also for their 
~ physical well-being. 

In February 1988 the Hunger Task Force under the 
~ direction of then-mayor Biagio DiLietcfs office implemented 
the breakfast program in response to a state-sponsored study 
on hunger in New Haven. The 1986 study reported that more 
than one-quarter of the families in the city's Hill 
neighborhood (near the Yale Medical School) did not have 
enough food. In reponse to questionnaires, families said that 
children sometimes missed meals and went to bed hUl)gry. 
City teachers observed that these children had difficulty 
concentrating. "Children told me they felt hungry," said 
Margaret Thomas, a teacher at Martin Luther King elementary 
school. ''I'd have to send them down to the cafeteria and buy 
them a snack so they could participate in class." 

Reagan-era budget cuts exacerbated hunger among city 
children. In 1981, revised federal guidelines reduced the 
number of New Haven students eligible for free or reduced-
price lunches. To compensate, the Mayor's Hunger Task 
Force recommended that New Haven open a free breakfast 
program to all students in kindergarden through eighth 
grade--even those ineligible for a free lunch. 

Despite the 1981 cuts, federal funding remained available 
to support breakfast programs in "needy'' districts--defined 
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as those communities 
in which 40 percent of the children eat free or reduced-price 
lunches. New Haven, where only a quarter of the students 
pay full price for lunch, easily qualified for funding. "One of 
the reasons the free breakfast is so important is that since the 
Reagan budget cuts, fewer families can have their children eat 
lunch for free," said Mary Ragno, Coordinator of the State 
Department of Child Nutrition. 

City officials, educators and community activists believe 
the meal program is working. "School breakfasts specifically 
improve the performance and attendance of the students," 
said Laura Cohen, Director of the Connecticut Anti-Hunger 
Coalition. Anne Antonucci, the school nurse a t Wexler 
Elementary, has noticed a reduction in the number of students 
who require her services. '1 no longer see children who don't 
feel well because they haven't eaten breakfast," she said. 

Gouterman believes that the program allows her to make 
more demands of her students. "I know they're eating, and I 
can push them during the day," she said. 

Breakfasts meet federal nutrition stan-
dards. "The government allows donuts 
as long as they're whole grain." 

As the' schools assume responsibility for more than 
phonics and math, students eat during time previously spent 
studying. 

Schools serve breakfasts in the classrooms rather 
than in the cafeterias, and teachers must allot class time to 
supervise meals. "I appreciate that it gets the kids to school on 
time because their parents want them to eat for free, but it 
takes time away from lessons," said Gouterman, who allows 
half an hour for breakfast in her classroom. 

Some question the nutritional value of the meals. 
"Parents sometimes complain that the schools are serving 
'junk food' when they see their children are eating donuts for 
breakfast," said Ragno, who stressed that all breakfasts meet 
federal nutrition standards. "The government allows donuts 
as long as they're whole grain," she said. Others feel the 
program promotes unhealthy eating habits. Linda Thorpe, a 
teacher at Martin Luther King elementary school said that 
some of her students habitually eat two breakfasts, one at 
home and one at school. "I can't stop them, even if they're 
overweight," she said. 

Despite these pitfalls, breakfast at school continues to 
grow in popularity. Since September, an additional 500 
students have joined the program. Ragno attributes this rise 
to increased economic hardship in New Haven, and social 
Schools teach students mealtime manners, a lesson once left to parents.
