acceptance of the program. New.Haven 
currently operates the largest breakfast 
program in Connecticut, followed by 
similar programs administered in 
Hartford and Bridgeport. 

Open to all students regardless of 
financial need, the breakfast program 
not only feeds hungry children, but 
assists parents as well. "If a working 
parent does not have time to make 
bacon and eggs every morning, she 
doesn't have to worry about whether 
her child will eat,'' said Head Public 
Health Nurse Muriel Oberg. Parents 
appreciate that schools provide this 
service. "If we're running late in the 
morning, my kids usually eat at school," 
said Susan Sapp, president of the Fair 
Haven Parent Teacher Organization. 
Gouterman notes that the program 
forces schools to assume responsibilities 
previously considered parental. "We're 
teaching children how to behave a t 
mealtime and clean up after themselves 
-skills they used to learn at home," she 
said. 

Breakfast is not the only parental 
responsibility the school has taken over. 
A social skills curriculum implemented 
throughout the New Haven schools 
emphasizes topics ranging from AIDS, 
drugs and alcohol to self-esteem, 
relationships, decision-making and peer 
pressure. The program grew out of the 
work of nationally-recognized Yale 
psychiatrist James Comer, who began 
developing social-skills education at 
Helene Grant Elementary School in 
1968. "We have learned to teach the 
whole child," said Diane Garber, 
coordinator of the Social Development 
Program for kindergarten students 
through fourth graders. "We know that 
you can't just tell a child to say 'no' to 
drugs without teaching him about the 
uniqueness of self and consideration for 
others." 

While 
assuming 
tradi tiona! 
parental roles through the Social 
Development Program, school officials 
also want to involve parents in the 
educational process. "Dr. Comer's _child 
development program taught us that in 
"Feeding children at 
school should be like 
busing, something we 
should take tor granted 
in public education." 
impoverished communities we must 
bring the schools and the parents 
together to provide a positive message 
for the children," said Mickey 
Kavanagh, facilitator for Curriculum 
and Social Development. 

As educators seek to cultivate 
children's social skills, they also bring 
health care into the schools. At their free 
clinic on State Street, the schools have 
long provided free immunizations and 
physicals to students w ithout private 
health care providers. School nurses 
routinely screen vision, hearing, and 
posture. But since 1983 New Haven has 
expanded its subsidized health services 
through in-school health clinics. These 
clinics, now operating in Wilbur Cross 
High School, Jackie Robinson Middle 
School, and-as of January 24-
Katherine Brennan Elementary School, 
provide more comprehensive health 
care than is avai!able in the offices of 
school nurses. The funds that subsidize 
the clinics come from several sources, 
including the state and federai 
governments and private organizations. 

By providing comprehensive health 
care, the clinics benefit both students 
and parents. These clinics oper~te in 
conjunction with nearby health facilities 
so that physicians can advise the nurse 
practitioners on duty at the schools. The 
nurses can make diagnoses and if 
necessary 
prescribe 
medication. 

Students can also go to the clinics for 
psychological counseling. 

Educators have long known that 
hungry and unhealthy children make 
poor students. In-school health clinics, 
the social development curriculum and 
the free breakfast program demonstrate 
that schools are providing services once 
considered solely the responsibility of 
the parent. While many educators are 
pleased with the success of these 
programs, they believe they need to do 
more. Ragno points out that free 
breakfasts alone cannot fully alleviate 
hunger among city children. Despite 
the present lack of funding, Ragno 
hopes eventually to implement a 
universal free lunch program. "Feeding 
children at school should be like 
busing," she said. "It's something we 
should take for granted as part of public 
education."
