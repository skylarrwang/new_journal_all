EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
A TNJ reporter wanted to write about 
"tracking" in the New Haven public schools. 
He hoped to talk to teachers and students at 
one of the city's high schools, but a high-level 
administrator squelched the project. The 
administrator feared that the reporter might 
give the school a bad rap. In his estimation, 
educators had invested too much time and 
energy cleaning up the schools to risk getting 
bad press. In the past, a few words from New 
Haven journalists had undermined the image 
that educators had worked so hard to create. 
"We've been burned before," said the 
administrator. 

While the reporter decided to highlight 
tracking by writing about a specific honors 
program, he knew he would not get the whole 
story. If we've learned anything from putting 
together thisÂ· special issue on education, it's 
that the whole story is an elusive thing. Even 
if administrators had given us free rein to talk 
to whomever we wanted, we knew our own 
biases could still skew our reporting. Though 
we live and study in New Haven, we all have 
a lot to learn about education in the city that 
surrounds us. Many of us get a glimpse of
February 1, 1991 
local schools by volunteering, but it is still 
difficult for us to gain an informed view of 
Elm City educational issues. 

On the national level, it seems equally 
difficult to get an informed view of education, 
the cause celebre on the domestic agenda of the 
'90s. The rhetoric often sounds hollow and 
abstract, and the catch phrases distant from 
reality. With this issue, TNJ 
hopes to 
contribute concrete information that will 
ground old arguments and generate new ones. 
Through interviews, research and a vigilant 
sense of our limitations, we have tried to 
report on the actual conditions and programs 
that operate in New Haven's public schools. 
Here we profile several people and programs 
that attempt to improve education in New 
Haven: a social studies teacher at Hillhouse 
High School, free breakfasts in the schools, 
Yale tutoring groups, the Macy Prep program, 
Superintendent John Dow and others. 

Through these articles we hope to look beyond 
ourselves and begin to understand the issues 
that confront the community around us.
