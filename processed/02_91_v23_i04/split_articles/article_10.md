towns and suburbs, drafted a law that would not force 
suburban children to attend city schools. For these legislators, 
Brittain argues, concern for local autonomy and the integrity of 
individual districts outweighed any desire for racial balance in 
the schools. "They hammered out a law that could not violate 
sacrosanct boundaries between urban communities and their 
suburban counterparts," he said. "They knew the law would 
not have any impact on the state's three largest cities." 

Brittain and the Sheff plaintiffs demand desegregation that 
will cross the lines between cities and suburbs. ''There simply 
are not enough white children in the cities to sprinkle around 
the urban school districts," Brittain said. He claims 
Connecticut classrooms must include both city and suburban 
schoolchildren. Although courts have refused to mandate 
interdistrict desegregation since the early '70s, Brittain is 
confident of victory. He emphasizes that Connecticut's current 
racial imbalance violates citizens' fundamental right to 
education as ensured by the state constitution. 

The state's attorneys argue that Connecticut cannot accept 
legal responsibility for the problem. ''The state did not create 
these demographic conditions and is not violating the 
constitution," said John Whelan, the main defense attorney in 
Sheff. Whelan believes that the state's racial imbalance should 
be addressed with policy initiatives, not court orders. "If the 
case is decided in favor of the plaintiffs, a single judge will be 
taking over the entire Hartford school system," he said. 

"Segregation," wrote Gerald Tirozzi, the state's Education 
Commissioner, in a 1988 report, "is educationally, morally and 
legally wrong." But he insists that court involvement won't
