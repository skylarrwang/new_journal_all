For The New Journal to maintain its 
regular publishing format would not 
be in the best interests of the Yale Uni-
versity community at this time. Rather, 
we feel that we can best respond to 
the current crisis by presenting a series 
of in-depth reports on issues of great 
concern to Yale and New Haven. The 
first in this series, a report on Yale's 
physical growth, had originally been 
planned for our next regular issue. Fol-
lowing this article is a proposal for 
Yale housing policy by the Student 
Community Housing Corporation.

Yale's growth, New Haven's loss. 
by Sam Millei 

The summer riots of 1967 shattered Dick 
Lee's liberal fantasy that redevelopment 
could transform New Haven from a tired 
old factory town into a model "slum-
less" city. True, during his sixteen years 
in office, the face of the Elm City was 
neatly uplifted. One hundred and forty 
acres of unsightly slum property were 
leveled. Famous architects were recruited 
to fill in the gaping holes. The present 
landscape of the Center City is the legacy 
of Lee's highly-praised achievement. In 
place of the embarrassing Oak Street 
slum which nestled uncomfortably close 
to Yale, we now have a clean, modern, 
and highly profitable downtown area. 

But in the process of Mayor Lee's ur-
ban renewal, which he rightfully claimed 
would "revitalize the dying and blighted 
Central Business District," over six 
thousand units of housing were de-
molished. Close to seven thousand 
households (which included an estimated 
forty percent of the entire Negro popu-
lation of the city) were relocated. The 
ultimate result of Lee's program was a 
housing deficit so serious that the Na-
tional Commission on Civil Disorders 
stated in its report on violence in New 
Haven that "it is hard to escape the ques-
tion of the relation of these large deficits 
... and the unrest that led to the rioting." 

There simply was not enough low in-
come housing built. With the comple-
tion of Church Street South only three 
thousand units will have been built under 
a Federal program to replace the six 
thousand demolished units. Eight hun-
dred of these new units in Crown, Madi-
son and University Towers are for upper 
income people; fourteen hundred are 
moderate income cooperatives; the re-
mainder were built for elderly and low in-
come families. 

The fact is indisputable that Yale was 
linked intimately with the Mayor's re-
newal policies. The University quickly 
saw the potential advantage in support-
ing the Lee program. The demolition of 
the Oak Street area, the city's worst slum, 
permitted the expansion of the Medical 
School facilities and rid Yale of a most 
discomforting neighbor. The Univer-
sity's fmt chance to help things along 
came in 1955 when Lee's program was 
in need of working capital. Yale, at that 
time, purchased the city high schools at 
Broadway and Tower Parkway for a 
price far over the market value. The two 
colleges built there, Morse and Stiles, 
were credited as part of the city's ur-
ban renewal program. 

Another example of Yale's involve-
ment with the clean-up-your-neighbor-
hood-tear-down-a-slum effort came in 
1962. Mr. J. Richardson Dilworth, a 
member of the Yale Corporation and of 
Macy's board of directors, had a talk 
with Lee that led ultimately to Macy's 
decision to come to New Haven. Yale 
was also instrumental in flnding the $4.5 
million that Roger Stevens, the developer 
of the Chapel Square Mall, needed to 
complete his project. So the city, with 
no small amount of help from its friend, 
was able to get some pretty new build-
ings and eliminate some embarrassing 
eyesores. 

Even today, as facts stare glaringly 
into its face, the city does not seem ready 
to admit that New Haven's housing situa-
tion is a significant factor in its overall 
problems. And Yale is even more reluc-
tant to claim its share of the blame or 
its part in correcting the imbalances of 
the situation. Aside from the arguments 
that Yale, as the city's leading institu-
tion and hoarder of social knowledge, 
might have a social responsibility to 
act, there is the fact that the University 
has a negative effect on the housing 
shortage in general. Yale's own expansion 
policies and its increasing enrollment 
have taken housing off the market while 
flooding it with new buyers. And Yale's 
studied indifference to the problems it 
causes is beginning to take its toll in the 
University's relationship with the city. 

Lee, before leaving office, called upon 
Yale to contribute three million dollars 
annually for the next three years to the 
city's ailing treasury. Yale has refused 
to act on this suggestion. Political oppos-
ition to Yale's voracious appetite for land 
also found expression in the Guida amend-
ment, which New Haven's present Mayor 
proposed and saw passed while he was

still a member of the Board of Alder-
men. This legislation blocks the Uni-
versity from utilizing more land except 
by special dispensation from the Board 
of Aldermen. 

While it is still unclear whether the 
Guida amendment will be upheld by 
the courts, University officials have be-
come extremely sensitive about where 
they make their new expansion. King-
man Brewster, in announcing the pro-
posed construction of one thousand 
new units of university housing, was 
careful to state that it would be placed 
on land already owned by Yale. 

The announcement of this sorely-
needed addition to the university hous-
ing stock was met coolly by many city 
and community leaders. In a recent dis-
cussion about the city's housing prob-
lems sponsored by The New Journal, 
various critics of Yale expansion voiced 
the opinion that the one thousand new 
units would not significantly improve 
housing conditions in the wider New 
Haven community. They argued that 
since the new units will house only Yale 
students and faculty, the housing short-
age faced by the community residents 
will not be erased. University officials 
insist that the additional units will take 
pressure off the local housing market 
by providing space on university land 
for Yale affiliates who now live off-
campus. Community leaders counter 
with the assertion that further expansion 
of Yale enrollment over the next five 
years will more than eliminate the bene-
fits of these new units. 

Whatever happens as a result of the 
new construction of University housing 
units, which we may not see for another 
three years, both Yale and New Haven 
desperately need new housing. In a re-
cent article Yale admissions officer 
Paul Capra, the narrowly defeated Re-
publican candidate for Mayor in the last 
election, asserted that Yale's dependence 
on the local housing market has more 
than doubled in the last five years. More 
than three thousand Yale students are 
presently living off-campus, and this 
figure promises to increase appreciably 
as over-crowding worsens on the under-
graduate campus. Capra condemned 
Yale for its "enormously unresponsive 
posture ... to these worsening conditions." 

He described the situation of the average 
middle-class New Haven worker as "so 
bad it's unmentionalbe." If this is the 
case, then where do the city's low-income 
residents stand? 

The intrusion of Y alies into the local 
market is particularly acute in the Inner 
City's last remaining low rent districts. 
Lake Place and Howard Avenue, where 
the University reportedly owns a con-
siderable amount of property, are prime 
examples. Jim Drazen, Director of Hous-
ing Development for the Redevelopment 
Agency, claims that the influx of students 
into certain areas of the Hill have en-
couraged landlords to sub-divide their 
buildings into efficiencies and to raise 
substantially their rents. Large numbers 
of graduate students seeking housing 
also cause rents to rise in the areas 
surrounding Yale. In addition, landlords 
may choose from many applicants for a 
given apartment, and thus discrimina-
tion is made possible. 

Student encroachment on the city's 
scarce low-rent housing resources has 
become a serious point of tension be-
tween local residents and the University. 
It serves only to heighten the suspicion 
and distrust on the part of many com-
munity leaders, both black and white, 
who regard Yale as a monster that is go-
ing to devour the city. Sal Ruotolo, 
President of the Hill Neighborhood 
Housing Development Corporation, put 
it this way: "We've now got the Yale-
New Haven Hospital. Yale's spreading 
out so much, they're going to start calling 
the city Yale-New Haven, period." 

In addition to reducing available low-
income housing, Yale expansion is dis-
placing small businesses. Jim Drazen of 
the New Haven Redevelopment Agency 
discusses the effects of this displacement 
on the individual shopkeepers and on the 
community. 

"Without saying whether commercial 
and other kinds of supportive facilities 
are more or less important than housing, 
I think we can conclude that the com-
munity is poorer for the loss of them, and 
the market isn't always up to replacing 
them. When those units or stores were 
created, it was under a set of conditions 
that no longer exist. A lot of these bus-
inesses, although they might be des-
cribed by a planner as marginal, do ren-
der services, in some instances to mar-
ginal people. But the marginal people, 
so-called, have to be considered in the 
planning process. 

" ... the guys with the economic muscle 
can move into the front block, or into 
new commercial properties that are de-
veloped along State Street, but a lot of 
these businesses fold up, and that's not 
only in some instances a personal tragedy 
for the small businessmen who are af-
fected and are not yet sufficiently pro-
tected by Federal regulation and Federal 
relocation payments, but also in some 
senses a hardship on the people who rely 
on these places. 

"I guess there's not much sympathy 
out there for the people who frequent 
the bars along State Street for example, 
but there's a definite social thing that 
happens. People don't spill over onto the 
street and create any threat for the com-
munity. The buildings are ratty, they're 
obviously ratty, but they're a gathering 
place for a lot of middle-age single 
men who have nothing else to relate to. 
As each of these structures, along with 
SRO (single room occupancy) buildings, 
gets demolished, these people get 
flushed out onto the landscape without 
any facilities to reabsorb them. 

''There are no entrepreneurs out there 
to replace the Strand hotel for example, 
or on a different level of thinking, from 
the point of view of a richer city fabric, 
the old Italian grocery stores, and the 
open air fruit market. For me, and this 
is a very personal reaction, the city is 
less interesting, less fascinating, a less 
diverse kind of place, as each of these 
stores and institutions gets pushed off." 

The Blossom Shop at 1080 Chapel 
Street is one business that must relocate 
because it now occupies the site of the 
future Mellon Gallery. Mr. Ed Lipson of 
the Blossom Shop emphasizes that he 
harbors no bitterness towards the Uni-
versity and its administration. Mr. Lipson 
criticizes the University, however, for 
not offering assistance to those it 
has forced to relocate. ''The University 
has not provided as well as it could have 
for those who have been displaced. It 
could have helped more. I feel that 
the existence of an accumulation of 
scholastic material such as will be kept 
in the Mellon Gallery is of greater value

than my personal comfort and con-
venience. It will be a costly move, finan-
cially and mentally, and it has changed 
my life pattern, but who am I to stand 
in the way of an institution like the Mel-
lon Gallery?" 

Sal Ruotolo has a contrasting view of 
the Mellon Gallery. "The fact that the 
Mellon Art Gallery will show some fme 
18th century pictures is all well and good 
for those in the city who want to see that. 
But it's like putting a tennis court in Hill 
Central. Who's got tennis shoes, huh?" 

Ruotolo feels that a major source of 
town-gown misunderstanding stems from 
the fact that the University fails to defme 
clearly and announce its future building 
plans. He likened Yale to a "second 
City Hall" which "keeps things quiet, 
then boom - they're sprung." 

University officials maintain that 
community members are unreasonable 
in their expectation of defmitive, long-
range Yale plans Assistant Provost George 
Langdon, who is responsible for Uni-
versity construction, remarked, "We're 
not sure exactly what we're going to 
build in the future, so we really can't 
announce definitive plans." He explained 
that the decision to build depended on 
many factors, including other University 
priorities and the wishes of the potential 
donor who would make new construction 
possible. Langdon admitted that the Uni-
versity is wary of community participa-
tion in the planning of University con-
struction. The problem, he asserted, was 
in determining just who represents the 
community - and which community? 

"Should the University take into con-
siedration the demands of every interest 
group in New Haven?" he asked. Yale's 
short-lived and unsuccessful attempt to 
establish a working relationship with the 
Black Coalition has prompted the Uni-
versity to seek advice when it comes to 
assessing "community views" from tra-
ditional sources in the city government. 

Langdon realistically stated that to 
expect no conflicts between Yale and 
the city would be nonsense. But for Yale 
to turn its back on the community, es-
pecially at this critical time, would be 
folly.
