in the words of one Harvard administra-
tor, can share the same complex because 
they often have the same spatial needs. 


Suburban land holdings of the Uni-
versity have the promise of loosening the 
tight housing market in the inner city 
for minorities, if the University were 
to assume the task of helping to develop 
its land as weU as to change zoning re-
structions made upon it by the local 
municipality. 

Ownership and taxes. 
The University need not and should not 
own the land or act as landlord. Uni-
versity-owned land could be given at 
a nominal fee or leased on a long tenn 
basis. Title lo the land could be held 
instead by a community-based sponsor, 
by a limited dividend corporation, or 
by a cooperative corporation composed 
of all the residents of the project. 

Thus, the city retrieves taxes di-
rectly from the property or, as in the 
case of a lower income cooperative, 
from the State Department of Com-
munity Affairs tax abatement program.
