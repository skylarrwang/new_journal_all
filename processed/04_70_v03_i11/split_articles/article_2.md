Proposals 
(The following proposals have been de-
veloped over the last tJVe months by the 
Student Community Housing Corpora-
tion out of student members' research 
into student and community housing 
needs.) 

Planning Council. 

A University-Community Planning Coun-
cil should be established and undertake 
responsibility for initiating and review-
ing all further University expansion. As a 
regulator of the University's physical 
growth, it should comprise the following 
members: four members from the Yale 
administration and faculty; two mem-
bers of the Yale student body - one 
from the graduate and professional 
schools and one from Yale College; 
three members from the city government 
including one from the Redevelopment 
Agency and one from the City Planning 
Commission; and four members from 
community groups. Such a council, set 
up with similar purposes and member-
ship, has been established. at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania. At Yale this coun-
cil could oversee the use of a revolving 
fund. 

Revolving Fund. 

Instead of constructing two new col-
leges, Yale could establish a five million 
dollar housing investment fund either 
from the portfolio of University endow-
ment funds or from an alumnus donor. 
Such a loan fund would not represent a 
decrease in the amount of the Univer-
sity's principal, since it is only a loan. It 
would, however, represent a better re-
turn than would the University's invest-
ment in a residential college. 

Such a fund could generate ten times 
as much housing for community and stu-
dent use than could a similar amount 
specified for a new college. For, in con-
junction with federal housing programs, 
this fund could wield tremendous lever-
age by serving as interim 'front-end', low 
interest financing for land acquisition 
and developmental costs of non-proirt 
sponsors. 

The fund could also serve as a limited 
dividend, housing partnership corpora-
tion to attract alum.ni as limited investors. 
The limited investor-partner would, bow-
ever, realize the full tax-depreciation on 
whatever was built. Such initiative might 
induce more support for urban housing 
from other institutions and corporations. 
Such moneys have already been loaned 
by Harvard, Wesleyan, and MIT. In New 
Haven, these funds could be applied in 
the following ways: 

Route 34 site. 

The forty-three acres of state land for 
the continuation of Route 34 could be a 
unique resource to the city and to Yale. 
One or two thousand units of housing 
could be built there as well as expanded 
Medical School facilities, provided Yale 
assist those community groups who intend 
to halt the construction of the road. 
Should the st.ate dete.rmioe to build the 
road, Yale could assist in the developing 
of air rights over the roadbed by agreeing 
to help defray the cost of a building 
platform . 

Vartually a new community could be 
constructed on this site offering to stu-
dents the opportunity to live in a di-
verse polity rather than in the academic 
village of the college. Sacramento State 
College constructed such a community 
for students, faculty, and workers with 
a federal below-market-interest-rate 
program for low and moderate income 
housing. In addition, such a development 
could make use of recent industrialized 
housing techniques to cut construction 
costs and time. 

Scattered sites. 

Like the MIT proposal for seventeen 
hundred units of mixed housing in 
Cambridge on many different sites, Yale 
could apply the housing investment to 
many vacant, smaller sites around the 
inner city for low-rise, high density hous-
ing. Such sites could also consist of 
existing buildings which need rehabilita-
tion, such as large hotels and houses. 
These sites are particularly suited for 
housing communes and small cooper-
atives which seem to be a small but grow-
ing trend among students and younger 
faculty. Such sites also lend themselves 
for more immediate solutions of housing 
students and low-income families who,
