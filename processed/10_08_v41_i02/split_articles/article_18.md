The inclusion of affordable housing 
in this urban vision was crucial to the 
success of Becker's bid for the site. New 
Haven's Chief Economic Administrator 
Kelly Murphy emphasizes that the City 
is committed to "making sure that there 
is affordable housing downtown," and 
Becker stepped up to the challenge. 
"You won't be able to differentiate be-
tween the affordable houses and the mar-
ker rate and won't be able to distinguish 
tenants living in affordable housing," he 
predicts. 

The 360 Stare project encapsulates 
DeStefano's vision for New Haven's re-
development. It is not only mixed-use, 
affordable, and green, but it also repre-
sents the first large-scale development in 
New Haven since the ambitious urban 
renewal schemes of the 1950s and '60s. 
This is the new wave of New Haven's 
transformation: Instead of demolishing 
blighted neighborhoods and delineating 
separate commercial and residential dis-
tricts, as New Haven administrators did 
fifty years ago, DeStefano has launched 
a comprehensive effort to restore a sense 
of urbanism to downtown New Haven. 
And 360 State is only the beginning. 
Forthcoming development projects in-
clude extensive housing developments, 
an overhaul of Union Station, and 
downtown relocation of the Long Wharf 
Theater and Gateway Community Col-
lege. Together, these projects could leave 
DeStefano's biggest mark yet. 

FOLLOWING A NATIONAL trend, New Ha-
ven's development is of the New Urban-
ist family. Born as a reaction to the ur-
ban sprawl of the 1980s, when cities like 
New Haven lost population to the sub-
urbs and watched their downtown cores 
erode, this design movemem aims to 
re-create cities and neighborhoods with 
discernable centers to serve as civic hubs 
for residents. New Urbanists envision an 
urban home for people of different back-
grounds and socioeconomic classes, dot-
ted with businesses, schools, parks, and 
residential sections. 

Today, housing in New Haven is 
surprisingly scarce. Although the city's 
housing projects supply a fair amount 
of centra!Jy located, low-income living 
quaners, the market offers few down-
town options co middle-class residents. 
"Our vacancy rate in residential rental is 
under two percent," Murphyexplainr--a 
number which means that the housing 
October 2008 
supply is far too small to meet dem.rnd. 
Stern characterizes the rela-
tionship between Yale and 
New Haven as (two peas in 
a pod, if you will two sides 
of a coin; their fortunes are 
Linked." 

The shortage in the cemer of town 
especially affects the middle and high-
income bracket, says Robert Stern ARC 
'65. The dean of the Yale School of Ar-
chitecture and a New Urbanism special-
ist, Stern is integral to the city's initia-
tives: In addition to Yale's new residential 
colleges, he will design two of the major 
downtown development projects, one at 
College Square and the other at the Vet-
erans Memorial Coliseum site. Stern sees 
housing, especially high-end housing, 
as an integral parr of building a vibrant 
downtown community. He claims that if 
decent housing were available, "people 
living in single family homes in Guilford, 
Hamden, or even on St. Ronan's would 
say, 'Let's get an apartment downtown 
with all of Yale's cultural opportunities, 
these restaurants, these shops, the theater 
at our fingertips.' " Such movement, he 
explains, "happens in many big cities-
New York and Chicago," but not in New 
Haven because there isn't anywhere for 
them to go. 

New housing, then, is an important 
step in New Haven's redevelopment. But 
housing alone will not a new city make. 
"You can't build a viable downtown on 
any single use," argues Stern. 

And you can't build a viable city on 
a single source of investment. Currently, 
the city's economy is institution-based, 
meaning that it depends on its many col-
leges and hospitals to fund development. 
One benefit, according to Murphy, is 
that "we don't have the high highs but 
we don't have the low lows ... Yale and 
Alberrus and Southern and Quinnipiac 
and Gateway and the hospitals are al-
ways investing, always building and are 
not going ro pick up and move some-
where else." This also means, however,

that the city has become largely depen-
dent on Yale's investment. The Univer-
sity recently sponsored the creation of 
an Economic Development Corporation 
and has been instrumental in redevelop-
ing Broadway and mid-Chapel. Becker 
cites a "symbiotic relationship between 
Yale and New Haven," and Stern charac-
terizes the relationship as "two peas in a 
pod, if you will, two sides of a coin; their 
fortunes are linked." 

In the 1950s and '60s, May-
or Dick Lee and his admin-
istration 'aramatically plun-
dered, sundered the urban 

Luring consumers and commerce back 
into the city will entail, in part, wean-
ing the city off of its reliance on Yale and 
building an enduring, non-Yale-based 
middle class. "It's dangerous to have es-
sentially one financial backer," Becker 
explains. He believes an influx of non-

ing it more like "Cambridge or Palo 
Alto. Stanford, Harvard, and M.I.T. play

tn town. 

Toward this end, the City expects its 
large development projects to gener-
ate more non-Yale jobs. According to 
DeStefano's Future Framework Plan, 
downtown development will generate 
over 30,000 jobs, both directly and in-
directly. The former Coliseum site, ac-
cording to Chuck Coursey, who handles 
public relations for its developer, North-
land Investment Corporation, is likely 
to include Long Wharf Theater, relo-
cated from its current home on Sargent 
Drive. Administrators hope the theater 
will bring retail, housing, and culture 
to the downtown area. Stern claims that 
Long Wharf will be more than just a cul-
tural draw. "The nice thing about Long 
Wharf and this is true of Yale's strong 
drama school as well," he says, "is that 
it's not just actors but electricians, set 
builders, sound people who have to go to 
have lunch." Ideally, the theater will en-
courage a dynamic urban environment 
made up of interdependent businesses. 
The City hopes the project will recapture 
the commercial buzz of New Haven's in-
dustrial prime, when this area, situated 
between the New Haven Green and the 
city's port, was a mercantile hub. · 

THE FINAL ELEMENT of this reinven-
tion, argues Douglas Rae, New Haven's 
former chief administrative officer and 
currently the RichardS. Ely Professor of 
Management at Yale, should be develop-
ing an improved transportation network 
to connect New Haven to the rest of the 
Northeast. "The reason that New Haven 
exists as a substantial city is tra.p.sport," he 
explains, alluding to the pre-automobile 
epicenter of rail lines and sea transport 
that connected New Haven to economic 
behemoths like New York and allowed 
the city to emerge as an industrial center. 
"We are the fringe of this gigantic moun-
tain; we're a foothill ... and we should 
think of ourselves in that connection 
more than anything else," Rae contin-
ues. With the growth of its transporta-
tion infrastructure, New Haven would 
have the potential to become almost a

reverse commuter dty. People could live 
in New Haven and contribute to its tax 
base while working in Stamford, Hart-
ford, or New York. 

While the burden of improving trans-
portation falls partly on the State, the 
City is trying to apply as much forward 
momentum of its own as possible. Mur-
phy hopes that the impending demolition· 
of the former Coliseum's massive parking 
lot will finally spur the construction of 
a second parking lot at Union Station. 
Eventually, the City hopes to compre-
hensively redesign the station, making 
it a retail as well as transportation hub. 
Administrators have proposed a three-
phase project that would not only pro-
vide parking but remake Union Station 
ala its D.C. and New York counterparts 
by attaching it to a large, mixed-use de-
velopment complex. Murphy points out 
that since the project "finances itself," 
New Haven will be able to begin work 
on the site as soon as it reaches an agree-
ment with the state. 

BY PIECING TOGETHER housing develop-
ments like 360 State, economic inde-
pendence from Yale, and a revitalized 
transportation network, city developers 
hope to recapture early 20th-century 
New Haven in its heyday. Despite ad-
mitted flaws 
like tenement houses, for 
example 
in this now-antiquated urban 
plan, this city once tied residents to their 
urban environment in a very concrete 
manner. In 1909, Frank Rice was elected 
as New Haven mayor on a platform of 
redoing the city's sidewalks. Factories 
like Winchester and Sargent provided a 
steady supply of jobs while prominent 
community organizations constructed 
tight social networks. This New Haven 
was densely populated, home to the 
wealthy and the poor, descendants of Pu-
ritan settlers and immigrants newly ar-
rived from Europe. New Haven's current 
leaders are particularly nostalgic for this 
urban setting, perhaps because the city 
strayed so far from it during the 1950s 
and '60s, when agents ofUrban Renewal 
razed entire neighborhoods to make way 
for highways and department stores. 

During this era, under the flag of Ur-
ban Renewal, Mayor Richard "Dick"-Lee 
and his administration pushed mass de-
velopment to revitalize the city. But by 
building so quickly and on such a large 
scale, with so little regard for the com-
munities they destroyed in their wake, 
Rae recounts, they "dramatically-plun-
dered, sundered the urban fabric." Worse 
still, the projects failed to create a strong 
mercantile sector that could compete 
with suburban alternatives. The large 
department stores 
Shartenberg's, Mal-
ley's, and Macy's 
did not foster a small-
er business community, which meant 
that once these stores closed, they left an 
urban wasteland in which, Clark re.calls, 
"every other store was boarded up." 

Decades of slow and patient City Hall 
effort eventually drew tentative shop-
keepers and residents back to downtown. 
Around 2003, the City first began to 
think about developing the abandoned 
department store sites in an effort to 
undo Lee's mistakes. But there is only 
so much that this downtown restoration 
can achieve for the rest of the city. "There 
are cases where you have spectacular 
downtown redevelopment like Balti-
more, which has no favorable impact on 
the city at large," Rae warns. 

And the project comes with steep costs. 
The City is investing significant funds in 
the development projects via tax abate-
ments and land grants. 360 State will 
only pay a fraction of assessed property 
taxes until 2014, and the land cost Beck-
.. 
er a single dollar. City officials are none-
. theless quick to defend the deal. The site 
has been vacant for 42 years, according 
to Murphy, and although the City has 
giveri developers like Becker significant 
incentive·s, the potential revenue lost is 
negated by the fact that he is building on 
a lot that for years has provided the City 
with no revenue whatsoever. Even when 
Becker is only paying a fraction of the 
taxes assessed on the site, this revenue 
will be more than the City received be-
fore. With Becker's development, Mur-
phy says, the site will gross "close to two 
million dollars a year. They're going to be 
the biggest taxpayer." 

Rae predicts, however, that it "will be 
a long time before there's much posi-
tive. impact on the tax base," and with 
the City having recently laid off 35 peo-
ple in a budget crunch, New Haven is 
in a poor position to be hemorrhaging 
money. These fiscal problems will almost 
certainly be compounded by the state of 
the national economy, and already, many 
of the city's ambitious plans have been 
put on hold. One must walk no farther 
than College Square to see the effects of 
the credit crunch on New Haven. This 
Scarpelli no's, like many small businesses, has been forced out of downtown New Haven to make 
way for large scale development.
