Goethe once proclaimed, "What is not 
started today is never finished tomor-
row." Well, duh. 

Goethe may have been a decent writ-
er, but I'm going to go out on a limb and 
say that at Yale, procrastination is a way 
of life. To paraphrase Freud, it probably 
all started in our childhoods. When I 
was nine I tried to read the Encyclopedia 
Britannica but lost motivation after the 
entry for "Anabaena" ("a genus of nitro-
gen-fixing blue-green algae with beadlike 
or barrel-like cells and interspersed en-
larged spores"). Or maybe there simply 
wasn't enough time, since, at the sarr1e 
age, I'd resolved to write a novel. But be-
tween learning long division and watch-
ing Power Rangers, I soon put the Pulit-
zer plans on the back burner. 

My problem, according to a few Yale 
professors-cum-entrepreneurs, was that 
I didn't incur external repercussions. 
Perhaps if I had been taunted because 
I didn't know what an anabantidae was 
(for the record, it's a farr1ily of fish) or 
had my fingers chopped off because I 
didn't write a novel" I would have had a 
little more success. 

Such is the theory behind Stidd(, an 
online service that aims to help users ac-
complish their goals by binding them to 
"commitment contracts." The brainchild 
of Yale Economics Professor Dean Kar-
lan, Yale Law School Professor Ian Ayres, 
and Yale School of Management student 
Jordan Goldberg '1 0, StickK is based on 
two well-known assumptions of behav-
ioral economics: First, incentives mo-
tivate people, and second, people don't 
always do what they claim they intend 
to do. 

The leap from theory to web site was 
simple enough, according to Karlan. "A 
lot of research suggests that commitment 
contracts can really make a difference 
and I wanted to see this in practice," he 
explains. 

His subjects first pick a goal from the 
following categories: lose weight, exer-
cise, run a marathon, vote, quit smok-
ing, and everything else. While the ma-
jority of StickK users commit to losing 
weight or exercising (40 and 25 percent, 
respectively), 30 percent create custom 
goals that run the gamut from "learn to 
use chopsticks" to "stop masturbating." 
Maybe the strangest custom goal Gold-
berg's seen? ''Adopt a baby from a third-
world country." 

After committing to a goal, us-
ers stake money on it. Pledge amounts 
vary; Stick.K's largest stake on record was 
$10,000, from someone who wanted to 
lose weight. Though such a risk might 
seem absurd, statistics show that those 
who pledge money are 40 percent more 
likely to succeed in their goal than those 
who don't. If they do fail, however, users 
must forfeit their money to a randomly 
selected charity, a friend, or an "anti-
charity." 

StickK is based on two well-
known assumptions of be-
havioral economics: First, 
incentives motivate people, 
and second people don't al-
ways do what they claim they 
intend to do. 

There are two designated "anti-char-
ities" on each ideological side of five 
controversial issues 
abortion, the envi-
ronment, gay marriage, gun control, and 
politics. Users are instructed to choose 
the organization most contrary to their 
beliefs to provide extra incentive to stay 
on task. According to Goldberg, StickK's 
CEO, those who select anti-charities are 
15 percent more likely to reach their goal 
than those who opt to donate money to 
charities or friends. 

The linchpin of this system is a referee, 
an individual who monitors the success 
of commitment contracts. Users can se-
lect anyone to be their referees 
friends, 
foes, family members, or even bosses. 
Each time a user submits a progress re-
port, his or her referee receives an email 
asking for confirmation of the report. 
The less daring SticK user can even es-
chew monetary stakes and rely solely on 
a referee for motivation. 

MY INTEREST IN STICKK was initially a 
clinical one. While I did acknowledge 
a margin for improvement, I was more 
or less happy with .myself and remained 
content to continue treating sushi as a 
finger-food and exercising only when I 
felt like it. Then I talked to my 15-year-
old brother Jared on the phone. 

"Hey, Jare, how you doing?" I began. 
"Pretty good. Got lotsa work What 
about you?" 
"Well, I'm writing an article on this 
web site that basically, like, helps people 
to achieve their goals." 
"You say 'like' a lot," Jared said. 
"Yeah, I know. But I'm not, like, half 
as bad as some of my friends.'' 
"You just said it again. Like, like, like. 
Hi my name is, like, Haley, and I really 
like saying the word 'like."' 
"Bye, Jared," I said. 

As unpleasant as it was to admit, Jared 
was right. For someone not from the San . 
· Fernando Valley, I was using the word 
"like" far too frequently. Suddenly moti-
vated to wean myself off my tic, I made a 
commitment on StickK. 

"I commit to avoid using the word 
'like' as a filler," I typed in the custom 
goal box. I knew that my goal was a lofty 
one, but I was determined to succeed. To 
maximize my chances of success, I staked 
$9.99 to the George W Bush Presiden-
tial Library, my anti-charity of choice. I 
then guilt-tripped a friend. into register-
ing as my referee and seven others into 
signing up on Stidd( as my supporters, 
which meant that they'd receive emails 
about my progress without having to di-
rectly report on it. 

Since I was working on a deadline, I 
signed up for only one week, the short-
est contract available. This meant there 
would be just one reporting period. It 
would be success or failure. If I let slip 
even one little "like," it was over. In 
hindsight, that was, like, so deluded. 

I MANAGED TO AVOID the L-word for all 
of a day by speaking like a robot. "I'll. 
Have. An. Iced. Coffee. Please." 
"Okay, R2-D2," smirked the Star-
bucks barista. 

On the second day, when speaking 
like an aridroid got tiring, I stopped talk-
ing altogether. 

"Haley, you're not going to mistakenly 
say 'like' if you ask for the salt," my ref-
eree said as I vigorously pointed at the 
saltshaker at dinner. Maybe that was so, 
but I felt I couldn't be too safe. When 
I wasn't eating or in class, I hid in my 
room so I didn't have to talk to people .. 

When I felt myself losing motiva-
tion, I pictured my money winging to-
ward Texas and meditated on tny favor-
ite Bushism: "Our enemies never stop . 
thinking of ways to harm our country . 
and our people, and neither do we." 

Then I got too comfortable. I was 
walking out of my architecture lecture _ 
with a friend, discussing the sketchbook 
assignment for that week 

"I just don't understand what we're 
supposed to draw," she complained. 
"Well, what Professor Purves said to 
do was, like, SHIT!" 

Even though I had failed, I couldn't 
bear the thought that Bush had gotten 
the better of me. I ·signed up for anoth-
er week with the same setup ($9.99 to 
Bush's library if I failed) but a slightly 
altered goal. Instead of trying to com-
pletely avoid using "like" in its. incorrect 
forms, I aimed to say it fewer than twen-
ty times a day, monitoring myself with 
a tally counter I'd rush ordered online. 
I figured physically holding the counter 
would remind me to avoid my nemesis. 
I was wrong. 

I failed again on the very first day, 
clocking in with a whopping 68 "likes." It 
would just slip out when I least expected 
it. In the Bookstore: ''I'm looking for this 
book about, like 
Damn it!" CLICK. In 
section: "I think what Kafka is trying to 
express is that, like, FUCK 
oh, sorry." 
CLICK. On the phone with my mom: 
"So for Jared's birthday I was thinking 
we could, like, SHIT." CLICK. Now I 
not only sounded like a Valley girl, but a 
Valley girl with Tourette's. 

SncKK, IT TURNS OUT, is not a magic 
wand that generates motivation out of 
thin air 
as its behavioral-economics 
foundation would suggest, it works best 
with adequate incentives. I thought that 
I had set up both of my commitment 
conuacts properly: I had a goal, a referee 
to keep me on point, and money pledged 
to an organization that I abhorred for ex-
tra incentive. How had I still failed? 

The answer may have to do with our 
natural response to negative incentives. 
Alan Kazdin, a Yale clinical psycholo-
gist who specializes in behavioral inter-
ventions, explains, "When people are in 
danger of losing money, especially to an 
organization that is contrary to their val-
ues, a likely side effect is that they will try 
to escape from it." 

It would be success or ail-
ure. li I let slip even one 
little ulike," it was over. In 
hindsight, that was, like, so 
deluded. 

For me, that avoidance manifested it.:. 
self in the humble amount of money I 
had pledged. $9.99, though not a negli-
gible amount, was by no means enough 
to keep my mind on my commitment 
contract. While I suspected this when I 
chose the amount, I wasn't willing to risk 
losing more money. 

Caroline Savello CC '09 ran (or, more 
accurately, did not run at all) into a simi-
lar problem when she committed to ex-
ercise five times a week for one month. 
"I only pledged $5 a week, which I 
knew from the beginning wouldn't be 
enough to keep me motivated to choose 
going to the gym over sitting on my 
couch watching TY," she remembers. "I 
begrudgingly forfeited the money but 
definitely felt tempted to lie." 

There is currently no way for the 
StickK administration to ensure that its 
users are telling the truth about whether 
they succeeded or not . 

"We operate on an honor code. We 
trust our users," Goldberg says. 

But perhaps StickK gives us too much 
credit. Out of the $650~000 that has 
been staked on the site since its" launch, 
only $50,000 has been forfeited. Maybe 
StickK really has helped its users success-
fully accomplish their goals, but I sus-
pected foul play. 

Anna Parks CC '09, who also used 
StickK for exercise purposes, was so trau-
matized by tf:te prospect of her money 
finding its way to the coffers of an an-
ti-gay-marriage organization that she 
"fudged" her report. 

"To me, the shame of lying was better 
than sending my money to them," Parks 
confesses. She didn't have a referee and 
admits that even if she had, "I would 
have convinced them to lie for me." 

Xan White PC '09, like Savello and 
Parks, registered on StickK with the in-
tention of pledging to jog regularly. But 
suspecting that, like Parks, he would lie 
to prevent his money from going to his 
anti-charity of choice, he decided against · 
making a contract at all. 

"I think StickK could be a great mo-
tivating tool if people found legitimate 
referees," White concludes. "Just having 
friends and family monitor you doesn't 
work because you can usually persuade 
them to lie for you." 

IF WE WERE SELF-MOTIVATED enough to 
run five times ·a week or adopt a Mala-
wian baby a la Madonna, we wouldn't 
need StickK to begin with. In theory, ex-
ternal motivators should help cultivate 
internal motivation. But the abundance 
of loopholes available to StickK users 
eliminates any real stakes the program 
could claim. Users can pledge an incon-
sequential amount of money that they 
won't be afraid to lose, or they can lie. 
Stick.K's fatal flaw is that it assumes that 
we are more motivated and moral than 
we actually are. 

"Extrinsic motivators aren't really ef-
fective for me," Parks admits. "I need to 
want to do something for myself." 

The source of my failure was not a 
lack of commitment, but rather pledg-
ing too linle money and attempting to 
subvert a subconscious habit. Next time, 
though, I am eager to give StickK a real 
shot, with higher stakes and a more 
stringent referee. 

"Hey, Jare," I say a few weeks later. 
"Hi. Mom told me about your little 
failure. Didn't think you'd be able to do 
. " 
It. 
"Thanks." 
"A-

"Actually, for once, I have another 
purpose for you. Over winter break, I'm 
going to make another commitment 
contract and you're going to be my ref-
eree. " 
"Your what?" 
"My referee. You just call me out 
when I say 'like."' 
"Said it." 
"Bye, Jared."
