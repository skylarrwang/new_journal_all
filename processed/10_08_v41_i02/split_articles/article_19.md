Northland Associates' vision for a Long WharfTheater relocated to the site of the former Coliseum. 
. 
block of College Street between Crown 
and George is barren, its previous small 
business owners evicted in order to make 
way for a new, large-scale project. But 
redevelopment has been stopped in its 
tracks and the storefronts sit, unneces-
sarily abandoned. In August, City of-
ficials cringed when the developer of a 
225-room luxury ho~el slated for the site 
announced a financially-motivated delay 
of at least six months. 

But given the costs of the economic 
collapse on a national level, New Haven 
may have caught a bit of a break. "In 
terms of our development schedule, we 
happen to be in a good place," claims 
Murphy. The City hopes that two years 
from now, when the 360 State project 
wraps up, the market will have reversed. 
Becker is similarly optimistic. "One 
thousand people will be hired between 
now and when we open," he says. More 
importantly, since the City does not cur-
rently need to pursue financing for any 
future projects, administrators do not 
have to struggle to sell bonds in today's 
credit market. And, of course, Yale and 
other institutions around town will never

stop building buildi:ngs, hiring residents, 
and keeping the city's economy afloat. 

THE NEW BREED of businesses that the 
City hopes its development p]ans will 
attract may drastically differ both from 
the city's current smattering of chain 
stores and its mom-and-pop stores left 
over from the New Haven of yore. A few 
long-standing, successful independent 
stores were already evicted to make way 
for the stalled hotel project on College 
Street. Some, like Cooper's Dress Shop, 
had been there since the strip opened 
in 1961, as part of the supposed Urban 
Renewal mercantile district. Now, except

for College Wine and Liquor, all of them 
have left or will leave soon. 

Few small businesses, however, be-
moan the changes to downtown. ''At the 
moment those business are happy about 
this," Clark says. Many of these stores 
actually testified on behalf of the devel-
opers and pressured aldermen to accept 
the proposals. The business owners who 
remain recognize that new housing units 
and the relocated Gateway Community 
College will bring thousands of people 
downtown who will need coffee, lunch, 
and clothing . 

This active interchange of residents, 
. businesses, and visitors is the urbanist 
city that John DeStefano hopes to recre-
att~. A place, in Stern's words, where you 
"walk out of your apartment and walk 
down the street, see the shop that has 
just changed their window, bump into 
someone you know, walk into a book-
store and buy a book or not or a cup of 
coffee, or walk across the Green, whatev-
er." Though DeStefano wants to restore 
the urban fabric of yesteryear, the fabric 
of New Haven has been torn so many 
times that his dream may be more of a 
mirage. But whether or not he can recap-
ture the old New Haven, he can still 
if 
the economy allows 
create a New Ha-
ven where people want to be .
