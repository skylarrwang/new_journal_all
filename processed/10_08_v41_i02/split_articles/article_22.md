Shafiq Abdussabur remembers sitting on
the shoulders of his mother, dressed in a
little black jacket bedecked with protest
buttons, staring out at an army of police
in full riot gear. The year was 1970, and
Ms. Abdussabur, her son, and twelve
thousand other Black Panthers and their
supporters had converged on the New
Haven Green to protest the trial of Pan-
ther leader Bobby Seale and several of
his compatriots for murder. In the fol-
lowing month, before the case ended in a
mistrial, activists would pelt the security
cordon with trash and rocks, two bombs
would go off in the Yale Hockey rink,
the National Guard would shoot tear gas
into the defenseless mob, and 23-year-
old Hillary Rodham, then a student at
the Yale Law School, would volunteer
for the ACLU to prevent civil rights
violations during the legal proceedings
against Seale.

hopeful glimmer of post-racial idealism.
"In the '60s, a group of leaders came out
who could relate to all kinds of people of
different creeds and colors in the name of
equal rights and opportunities," Abduss-
abur says. "People like Martin Luther
King and Malcolm X were black lead-
ers with a universal message." Now, with
the prospect of Barack Obama's victory
in November, Abdussabur sees the same
potent mixture of hope and conflict he
saw that spring in 1970, when the New
Left and Black Power movements stood
side by side, however uneasily.
"Black people are looking for Mal-
colm in Barack, others for Martin," Ab-
dussabur suggests in his au-thoritative
and resonant tone. "Many white people
are looking for Bobby [Kennedy]. In the
life of Barack Obama, there is a little bit
of all of that, and everyone is claiming
their piece."
For most, the Seale trial has faded to a
footnote in the history of Yale and New
Haven or a better-forgotten cultural
battle of the '60s. But for Abdussabur,

Haven's first black mayor, in 1989
New
Haven's black leaders see Obama both as
a black politician and as its antithesis: a
post-racial candidate.
"He's lived that life, he's had that ex-
perience African Americans share," says
Abdussabur, who works as a police of-
ficer and has launched initiatives to de-
crease gun violence, winning City Hall's
Man Of The Year award in 2006. ''As
president, he will have a responsibility to
every man and woman in this country."
But, Abdussabur concedes, "When I go
into the voting booth in November, sure,
I love Obama a little bit more for being
black, I trust him a little bit more for be-
ing black."
Abdussabur believes that Obama's
campaign promises a new sense of pos-
sibility for the next generation of Mrican
Americans, a sense he lacked during his
own elementary-school years. "One day
in class," he recalls, "the teacher asked
which one of us wanted to be President,
and I was the only black kid who raised
his hand. Had it been a different ques-
tion, who can be President, I'm not sure
I would have done the same thing. But
now, after Barack's run, everyone in that
class can raise his or her hand, even the
girls."
"The black community has
written Barack a check. That
check is for outreach and-
the amount is for change.
And I believe when Obama
wins in Novembe1; African
Americans will see that check
cashed. n

Yusuf Shah, an Mrican-American
New Haven alderman, sees Obama dif-
ferently. His vision of Obama matches
the campaign's portrait of a figure who
transcends race. "Barack Obama owes
the 路black community nothing," he says
pointedly.
Shah's belief is rooted in his - own
route to political prominence, a route
very different from Abdussabur's. While
Abdussabu r's formative experience was
the racially charged Seale trial, Shah has
October 2008
spent much of his career bridgip.g the
gap between his own ideology and back-
ground and the very diverse demands of
his constituents. A black Muslim, Shah 路-
believes his religion and race are essen-
tial spiritual and historical guides that
inform his views, but that they are not
the end of the story. Shah has come to
see Obama much as he sees himself. as
someone who has worked 路to transcend
the interests of a single racial or ethnic
group. "Since he's the first African-Amer-
ican candidate, I'm celebrating that," the
alderman says. "But it's because his poli-
tics and motives are on point that I sup-
port his run."
"Above all," Shah explains, "Barack's
message is, 'You can make it if you try.'
A lot of people in New Haven say that
there's a problem with our youth. There
isn't. They're broke; they come from bad
neighborhoods. You give these kids an
incentive, show them that they can make
it, and that will have an effect."
Shah believes that Obama's success
could mark a sea change in the nation's
attitude toward the political promise
of black Americans. "To see an Mrican
American reach this level," explains the
alderman, "to me means that America
.
'
has .reached a level of understanding that
racial context is not the issue. Instead, it's
the issue of what we need as a country."
Shah sums up the situation in terms of
his faith. "Islam is a religion of peace:
anything that will bririg about positive
change is blessed. We hope that it means
Obama will be in the White House. But
at the end of this election, there will need
to be a taqueed, a unity, to make Ameri-
ca a blessed country." For Shah, the issue
of Obama's race is crucial not because it
represents a specific victory for the Af-
rican-American community, but because
it communicates a desire for the nation's
people-to draw closer as a whole, to reach
taqueed together.
ON FEBRUARY 2, Barack Obama clinched
New Haven's Democratic primary over
Hillary Clinton by a two-to-one margin,
culling roughly twelve thousand votes
to the New York senator's six thousand.

Hanks, Mayor and Barack-backer John
DeStefano declared, "New Haven is go-
ing to be why Barack Obama wins the
state of Connecticut."
