**The Plague of the Investment Banks**
**Author: Dara Lind**
**Page number(s): 38**

And so it came to pass iri . the city of 
Manhattan that a plague fell upon the 
largest of the houses of investment bank-
ing, such that they turned to dust or be-
came deformed. The plague struck first 
the house of the brothers Lehman, and 
destroyed it. Then came it to the house 
of Merrill Lynch, called Merrill, and did. 
not destroy it, but made it weak; and the 
elders of that house sought relief from 
the plague, and they placed themselves 
and all of their house under the mark of 
the house of Bank of America. And the 
houses of Goldman Sachs and Morgan 
Stanley transformed themselves and were 
no more called "investment banks," but 
were called "bank holding companies," 
and so they did change themselves and 
were not destroyed. 

And word of the plague spread quick-
ly throughout the land of New England, 
but most quickly through the settle-
ments of Eli, and made them annoyed. 
For it was then of the season when each 
year the most prosperous houses in the 
great cities would send men and women 
laden with gifts to sojourn to the settle-
ments of Eli and the other tribes of Ivy. 
And these were called the recruiters. And 
the houses of investment banking were 
known for their generosity in sending 
many recruiters, and adopting many 
tribesmen of Eli, though few understood 
the trade upon joining the house. 

But upon hearing of the plague it was 
said among the people of Eli that the 
38 
banks would take none but those who 
had already worked a season with them. 
And lo, those chosen did not. accept the 
offer at first, but waited to see the effects 
of the plague. Such was the caution of Eli 
in those days. And those who had worked 
within the house of Lehman, which had 
been destroyed, allowed themselves only 
a few days for mourning, and after re-
turned to their carousing. And they said . 
among each other, Hey, we still have op-
tions, for so they thought. Such was the 
uncertain hubris of Eli in those days. 

And it was the custom among the tribe 
of Eli to gather all the recruiters together 
for a single day, and each house was giv-
en its own stall as in the marketplace: the 
bankers and the consultants, the hedge 
funds and the makers of technology. 
Thus the eldest generation of the tribes-
men of Ell could walk among the stalls, 
collecting gifts of pens and water bottles 
and ping-pong balls, each with the mark 
of the house that brought them. And this 
gathering was called the Career Fair. 

But in these days a wariness set upon 
the settlements of Eli, and at the Career 
Fair few sought out the stalls of the in-
vestment bankers, though many were 
richly laid. For they clamored instead 
at the stalls of the Boston Consulting 
Group and its brethren; and this was 
indeed wise, for the commotion of the 
plague had made work for the consul-
tants.

And word of the plague 
spread quickly throughout . 
the land of New England, 
but most quickly through the 
settlements o Eli:~ and made 
them annoyed. 

And many came to the stalls of the hedge 
funds, whose recruiters called among the 
clamor of the Fair, Everyone else is freak-
ing out, whereas we understand money. 
We beat the market. And this was pleas-
ing to Eli, and many who knew nothing 
of markets sat among the hedge funds, 
and took the gifts they offered. 

But while many stopped at other 
stalls, none abandoned the bankers en-
tirely, for they did not see that the plague 
of the house of Lehman was not yet 
past, but spreading. One said, Just think 
about what's going to happen to the real 
economy. His prophecy was private and 
unheeded. 

Yet, lo, in the weeks after the Career 
Fair signs of plague began to spread out-
ward throughout the land. And fear grew 
among the tribesmen of Eli.
