at it," Wright says. "But a lot of people 
think of a map as an outcome, and for 
me, it's a starting position." A map is to 
the geography student what textual evi-
dence is to the English major: a tool used 
to prove a larger thesis. "Maps have im-
portant rhetorical potential. You can be 
very persuasive about a particular line of 
inquiry by using maps in different ways. 
They can be manipulated," Wright ex-
plains. 

Paradoxically, one of the most re-
spected faces of 21st-century geography 
is also one of the most technical. Global 
Imaging Systems (GIS), a form ofdigital 
mapping, is one of today's most cutting-
edge areas of geography. GIS draws heav-
ily upon satellite imagery, creating visu-
als of places and spaces for such varied 
applications as tracking polar bears for 
wildlife conservationists and spending 
patterns for marketing firms. If anything 
has made geography more accessible and 
appealing in the 21st century, it is GIS, 
to which procrastinators across the globe 
became addicted when Google Earth put 
the world at their fingertips. 

The rise of GIS exemplifies the re-
emergence of geography in a new form 
that fuses its technical and conceptual 
strains. Avoiding the word "geography," 
Harvard opened a "Geospatial Library" 
in 2002, an online database that was cru-
cial to the foundation of the university's 
Center for Geographic Analysis. That 
same year, scholars at Brown created a 
program called "Spatial Structures in 
the Social Sciences." S4, as the program 
has been futuristically nicknamed, was 
designed to promote spatial analysis by 
bringing Global Imaging Systems and 
GIS experts to campus to offer their ex-
pertise as spatial consultants to Brown's 
existing departments and to train gradu-
ate and undergraduate students in GIS. 

Yet none of these programs are full-
fledged departments. 

"7he potency of geography is 
that it's kind of a corrective 
to certain illusions about 
globalization. " 
-Haun Saussy 

At Dartmouth, meanwhile, the plain-
ly named Department of Geography 
is remarkably successful. "We've got a 
October 2008 
pretty good reputation," Wright says. 
This is an understatement: Last year,. the 
department graduated a record high of 
47 students out of a class of 1,1 00, while 
the historic average hovers around thirty. 
Geography ranks in the top ten most 
popular undergraduate majors at Dart-
mouth. 

While any discussion about the forma-
tion of a geography department at Yale 
is, at best, on the backburner, the Uni-
versity is beginning to see geography as a 
hot topic. At the beginning of the fall se-
mester, Yale's American Studies program 
began a search for a cultural geographer 
to fill an assistant professorship. "We 
were asking ourselves, 'Where are the ar-
eas of real excitement? Where are people 
really pushing the boundaries? Where 
are people doing work that will serve our 
department's [needs] and not duplicate 
what we already have?"' says Matthew 
Frye Jacobson, chair of the American 
Studies Department. "Geography car-
ried the day." The theme of this fall's 
Franke Lecture Series in the Humani-
ties--distinct from Saussy's course 
is 
"Mental Geography: Mapping, Cogni-
tion, Appropriation, Inscription." Its ar-
ray of lecturers 
a geographer; a profes-
sor of psychology and education, and an 
anthropologist 
points to another un-
derlying facet of geography that has hin-
dered its fight for its own department: It 
is, at heart, an interdisciplinary study. 

Yet geography's interdisciplinary na-
ture is also one of the qualities that put it 
- at the cutting-edge of academia. "The in-
terdisciplinary discipline is on the rise," 
says Pope, whose work studying women 
and HIV in Latin America requires lit-
~ 
eracy in such disparate fields as epidemi-
ology, gender studies, and area studies. 

Julie Newman, director ofYale's Office 
of Sustainability, is an advocate for inter-
disciplinary studies on campus. Address-
ing the "new challenges" of the modern 
world, Newman argues, will "require ed-
ucational systems that allow 
beyond al-
low, encourage 
cross disciplinary ways 
of thinking." Many schools, however, ac-
customed to the lines between academic 
fields 
lines that geography jumps 
are 
reluctant to support as interdisciplinary 
a department as geography. "There's a lot 
of lip service paid toward them, without 
much structure," Pope explains. Priori-
ties boil down to dollars. "There are a lot 
of interdisciplinary programs, but they're 
not their own proper departments, so 
.. 
many times they don't have their own 
funding if any funding." 

Some would say this is a good thing. 
Critics claim that the most useful aspects 
of the study of geography-have been ab-
sorbed by other disciplines, rendering the 
need for a distinct department obsolete. 
"[Geography was] kind of swallowed 
up as area studies," says Yale's Jacobson. 
Symbolically, the former home of Har-
• 
vard's influential geography departme.Q:t 
is, today, its East Asian Studies Depart-
ment. At Yale, the interdisciplinary Eth-
nicity, Race, and Migration major ap-
plies a geographic spatial awareness to 
discussions of identity but is only offered 
as a second major. 

cc-u;e were asking ourselves, 
cWhere are the areas o real 
excitement? Where are people 
really pushing the boundar-
ies?'" says Matthew Frye ja-
cobson, chair of the American · 
Studies Department. ("(Geog-
raphy carried the day. " 

Still, proponents of geography defend 
the field's right to its own department. 
"We are the only discipline that pays 
primary attention to scale, location, and 
space. No other discipline really does 
what we do. And it really does matter," 
Wright pleads. There's certainly evidence 
to support his claim. After all, geography 
is always becoming. No longer a disci-
pline about drawing boundaries, geogra-
phy is a discipline about pushing them.
