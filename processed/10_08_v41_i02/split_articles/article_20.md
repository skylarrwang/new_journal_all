CONTINENTAL DRIFT 
As a legendary philosopher concludes his career, the 
Yale Philosophy Department contemplates its future. 
The 1980s and '90s were troubled times 
for Yale's once prominent philosophy de-
partment. Fierce infighting 
the result 
of both personal and academic quar-
rels 
resulted in the exodus of almost all 
of Yale's continental philosophy profes-
sors. Professor Karsten Harries PC '58 
GRD '62 survived the strife, but most of 
his fellow continental experts in _French 
and German Enlightenment thought 
left the department and were replaced 
with scholars of analytic philosophy, 
which focuses on logic and language 
and includes the fields of metaphysics, -
semantics, and epistemology. Soon, Har-
ries was the last major hold-out of the 
continental tradition, and since then he 
has continued to attract a broad range of 
non-philosophy majors with such popu-
lar courses as "The Philosophy of Archi-
tecture" and "Art, Love, and Beauty." A 
legend at Yale and beyond, Harries cur-
October 2008 
rently serves as the Philosophy Depart-
ment's director of graduate studies and, 
throughout his tenure, has advised over 
~~ 
58 dissertations 
more, he claims, than 
any other living philosopher. But after 
fifty years at Yale, he has finally decided 
that it's time to retire. 

Harries recently announced that he 
will be teaching every one of his courses 
for the last time. Although it may take 
as long as five years for him to fulfill this 
pledge, his impending departure has left 
many of his colleagues, like Professor 
Seyla Benhabib GRD '77, asking: "What 
does the department do now?" 

lfAruuES, WHO SPORTS quintessentially 
professorial tweed jackets, is looking 
forward to retirement. He sees it as an 
opportunity to marshal his thoughts into 
books. "It's a good occasion to pull all 
my notes," he said, and to arrange them · 
for publication. His Kierkegaard seminar 
notes are already headed for the press, 
and he hopes that notes from his Heide-
gger seminar will soon follow. But Har-
ries also worries about the department he 
· is leaving behind. "The continental tra-
dition is still underrepresented," he says. 
"There is virtually no one now. . . The 
philosophers I am talking to and [who] 
matter to me are not at Yale."

Harries and herself a bit of a continental 
expert who now teaches in Yale's political 
science department, is also concerned. 
"There are no [other] senior continental 
philosopher appointments," she explains. 
"They don't have anyone teaching Ger-
man idealism, and that's just not right. 
That's so silly, given Yale's foundations in 
the department." Yale's continental schol-
ars were, in fact, hugely prominent in the 
field during the 1960s, driving thought 
and shaping the University's reputa-
tion. When their differences with their 
analytic colleagues in the 1980s grew so 
intense that the department's hiring pro-
cess ground to a standstill, many conti-
nental professors left, and few were re-
placed. If Harries' departure were to lead 
to a neglect of the European philosophic 
traditions, Benhabib believes it would be 
"

a trage y . 

Philosophy major Geoff Shaw BR '1 0 
took Harries' "Art, Love and Beauty'' last 
year and appreciated its continental ap-
proach. "It had Nietzsche, Schopenhauer 
and Kant, [who] certainly wouldn't be 
taught at the upper level," he remembers. 
In his experience, upper-level philosophy 
18 
courses "really only study the analytic 
stuff." And though ·he likes the analytic 
material, Shaw explains that the branch 
covers "language, logic, not what it's like 
to be alive. I learned about being a per-
son in Karsten's class." To Shaw, it almost 
seems like the Yale Philosophy Depart-
ment "has given up on the meaning of 
life. Its educational mission should be to 
teach people about living, yet it's focused 
on stuff people find uninteresting." 

To Geo Shaw BR ~1 0~ it al-
most seems like the philoso-
phy department cchas given 
up on the meaning of life. " 

Shaw points out that potential philoso-
phy majors interested in the history of 
intellectual thought often gravitate to 
majors like the Humanities and Ethics, 
Politics, and Economics in search of a 
broader definition of philosophic study. 

Brian Earp CC '09's defection from the 
philosophy major to cognitive science, 
on the other hand, reflects the increasing 
convergence of science and philosophy, 
a trend that is partly responsible for the 
current emphasis on the analytic branch. 
It wasn't that the philosophy major was 
lacking, Earp insists, but that he was 
"getting excited about theories of mind" 
and wanted to pursue an empirical line 
of study. One concern Earp does have is 
that, compared to other major universi-
ties, Yale's Philosophy Department ranks 
rather low. According to Philosophical 
Gourmet, a popular online ranking of 
philosophy departments, Yale ranks 
16th in the nation. Although this rank 
has been rising over the past ten years, 
it still falls short of schools like NYU, 
Rutgers, the University of .Plttsburgh, 
UCLA, Harvard, and Princeton. "There 
are some very good philosophers on our 
faculty," Earp acknowledges, "but I've 
yet to take a class in which we've actu-
ally read anything written by anyone 
who teaches at Yale." 

HARRIEs, WHO INSISTS that the depart-
ment ha.S recovered from the turmoil of 
the 1980s, is relieved that this period 
has passed. "We would have to go back
