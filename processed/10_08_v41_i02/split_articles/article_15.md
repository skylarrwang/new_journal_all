The Yale Divinity School talks disarmament.


Standing in the Yale Divinity School
common room, beneath the benevolent
gaze of portraits of deans past, were a
Navy officer, a United Nations diplomat,
and a slew of clergy from around the
country. They were mostly white, mostly
male, and mostly middle-aged
not the
usual demographic to be discussing "vul-
nerability." But as the room filled with
the melodies of choir practice from across
the quad, the crowd spoke of an "anx-
ious age." Though the only weapons on
the premises were special YDS ballpoint
pens poised to fill tender Moleskines and
stern legal pads, the assembled were con-
vinced they were not safe.

Participants in the Divinity School's
annual Sarah Smith Conference gath-
ered on Prospect Street to talk about
nuclear nonproliferation. Held in honor
of YDS graduate and Methodist moral
leader Sarah Smith, who died in 1999,

the conference was designed to focus on
different issues of ethical and religious
relevance; in recent years, it has centered
on homelessness and public faith. This
year's topic, in line with Yale's push for
global engagement and growing aca-
demic angst over nuclear policy, was ''Are
We Safe Yet? Vulnerability and Security
in an Anxious Age." The question drew
a crowd of 112 from across the North-
east, as well as some from as far away as
the UK, Canada, and Australia, for two
packed September days to ponder how
religion, Yale, and religion at Yale can
possibly change the world.

Playing a starring role at the confer-
ence was Sergio Duarte, the UN's High
Representative for Disarmament Affairs,
who gave the keynote address. "Disar-
mament, in short, represents the fusion
of idealism and realism," he declared. "It
is the right thing to do, and it works."

Religious leaders, he explained, can ex-
tend their mission of "serving the hu-
man family" by joining in the push for
total nuclear abolition. His idea is not a
new one, dating back at least as far as the
1980s, when the US Council of Catholic
Bishops was one of the most vocal ad-
vocates of the Nuclear Freeze movement;
calling for a moratorium on all nuclear
production.

And at Yale during the '60s and '70s,
the University's spiritual community
benefited from the energizing presence
of its chaplain, Reverend William Sloane
Coffin YDS '56. Coffin preached deseg-
regation, anti-war action, and, after leav-
ing Yale and relocating to Manhattan's
Riverside Chapel, anti-nuclear activism.
As Coffin well understood, nuclear dis-
armament can take on a special urgency
in the hands of the faithful.
