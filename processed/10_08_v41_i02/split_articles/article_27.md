You don't have to know much about topography to imagine that fighting for geography education is an uphill battle. 
Study after study has desensitized the public to American students' geographic illiteracy, showing that two-thirds of Americans aged 18 to 24 cannot identify Iraq on a map; that six months after Hurricane Katrina, 33 percent of Americans in that age range failed to locate Louisiana; that nine in ten high school graduates in the United States do not know where Mghanistan is. These figures are just a few of many similar statistics that are both alarming and, to students who have been educated in geographically-ignorant America, entirely expected.


Yale is not exempt from this flaw in the American educational system. The University, which hasn't had a geography department since 1967 and employs no geographers at the undergraduate level, offers a bleak landscape for study of the discipline. In this respect, the University reflects the Ivy League norm. Though most, if not all, Ivies incorporate geographic methodology mapping and spatial thinking in programs such as economics, area studies, urban planning, and geophysics, only Dartmouth has a department of geography.


This hasn't always been the case. In the 17th and 18th centuries, when seven of the eight Ivies were born, "the study of the globes," as geography was then known, was integrated into the founding curricula of all of them. At the turn of the 19th century, elite universities began to move away from the goal of forming well-filled minds in favor of forming well-made minds. As the focus on mastering specific knowledge waned, so too did the study of geography, which at that time was restricted to plotting and memorizing maps of the celestial and terrestrial spheres. Geography began to be seen not as a college discipline but as a grade-school subject. By 1830, only the University of Pennsylvania still offered a geography curriculum.


The near disappearance of geography from the Ivy League could be seen as just another case of Ivory-Tower elitism. 
Later in that century, however, the work of an introverted English naturalist put Ivy League geography back on the map. Charles Darwin's theory of evolution reignited interest in geography, this time as a study of "man-land" relationships. For a little under a century, geography thrived in many different forms throughout the Ivy League. Physical geography, a sub-discipline closely related to geology, was the strength of Harvard's department; at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, scholars studied human use of natural resources, pioneering the sub-field of economic geography; and Yale led the area of human geography. By 1920, however, what Richard Wright, a professor of geography at Dartmouth, calls "the heyday of Ivy League Geography" had passed. Geography's most recent fall was in many ways a victim of coincidence. In just a few years, the discipline lost many of its all-stars to death, illness, and retirement. While geography programs at each of the schools waxed and waned throughout the 20th century, only Dartmouth's survived into the 21st. Elsewhere on the globe, geography remains an incredibly popular field some argue that the discipline is especially relevant for former colonizing and colonized peoples. Even within the United States, geography thrives at many Midwestern state schools. But for most of the Ivy League, geography is little more than a memory.

The discipline's struggle to regain its footing at the Ivies can perhaps be mapped to a struggle over the definition of the field. What in the world is geography, anyway? Despite the deplorable state of American students' knowledge of the schoolhouse globe, the notion that mere fact-based mapping constitutes geography has proved the field's biggest obstacle since academia did away with fact-gathering. It is all too easy to overlook the discipline's theoretical component, focusing instead on its applications the data collection side of geography. In this way, the near disappearance of geography from the Ivy League could be seen as just another case of Ivory-Tower elitism. Critics with a disdain for the vocational question the discipline's intellectual merit. Their claims are not entirely unfounded. At Central Connecticut State University, a sub-discipline called the geography of tourism has become increasingly popular. "A lot of our students are different from Yale students in that they are thinking of college as job training," says Cynthia Pope, a CCSU geographer who is teaching a medical geography course at the Yale Medical School a vocational institution. And, of course, it is the conceptual, not the vocational, that impresses academia. "You find this in every field," explains Haun Saussy, a professor of literature at Yale, who is currently teaching a humanities course called "Mental Geography." "We talk about the theory of translation though we don't reward people for doing translations. Translating becomes a technical thing."


Pope objects to the view of geography as "sticking thumbtacks on a map to indicate places you've visited," explaining her much more nuanced approach to the discipline: "The most basic definition of geography for me is how humans interact with their environment. The underlying themes are space and place how place impacts humans and how humans impact place."


Wright, the Dartmouth geography professor, offers an equally passionate defense of conceptual geography. "I want to emphasize that we theorize about these things," he says. "It's not a matter of collecting information about places or thinking about map projections. We theorize how scale works."

Today's theorizing revolves largely around shifting borders. In the age of globalization, geography is more relevant than it has been since the age of exploration. Many scholars believe that the boundaries separating today's countries from one another whether they be artificially or naturally drawn are no longer the most useful way to think about humans' relationships with each other and with the earth. "People are kind of taking it as faith that globalization abolishes distance," says Saussy, but geography complicates that assumption. Geographers are interested in the nuanced boundaries that separate people, in more than just physical features like the Berlin Wall or the Atlantic Ocean. "If you're a Haitian peasant, it's very hard for you to get to Miami, but if you are a professional in Beijing you can very easily, by sending a resume across seas, find yourself in New Haven," Saussy explains. "The potency of geography- is that it's kind of a corrective to certain illusions about globalization."


That's not to say that modern geography has done away with mapping. "Yes, we draw maps. And we're pretty good
