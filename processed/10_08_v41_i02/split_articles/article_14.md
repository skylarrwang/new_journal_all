Award-winning filmmaker teaches Yalies to let go.


Film, says Laura Poitras, "takes over your
whole world."
Poitras is young-looking, with pretty,
thick-lashed brown eyes. She gestures
delicately with her long, pale fingers,
speaking softly and lifting her voice to
curl statements into questions: "I think
we should just talk about ideas?" She is
fond of saying "like" and "totally," and
there is something girlish about the way
she forms her l's
lightly, with the very
tip of her tongue. She is hardly the pic-
ture of a war-zone reporter.
Yet she is now working on the second
film of a planned trilogy about the af-
termath of September 11. The first, the
2006 Iraq documentary My Country,
My Country, launched her to national
prominence with Oscar and Indepen-
dent Spirit Award nominations. Despite
her subject matter, Poitras insists, "I just
think of myself as an artist .... Before this
I wasn't running around going to war
zones. I'm not, like, a war filmmaker."
Until recently, she wasn't even a docu-
mentary filmmaker. Poitras started in
the '80s as a chef in expensive French
restaurants in San Francisco. As the
work slowly sapped her love of cooking,
she turned to another sort of craft, tak-

ing classes in avant-garde film and even-
tually leaving the restaurant for her new
love. She eventually drifted to cinema ve-
rite, recording "truth" without artificial
devices like interviews or the filmmaker's
visible presence. Her 2003 film Flag 'Wars
was her first documentary, the globally
acclaimed My Country, My Country her
Â·second. She is now working on the sec-
ond installment of her 9/11 trilogy. Film
has taken Poitras over, and she has rio
plans to shake its hold.

Her mantra is simple. She
asks of films-her own and
others' only one thing:
"I
want to be moved."

"That experience of filming, that's
what I live for," she explains. "When
you're really capturing something that's
happening before you just in really hu-
man terms. Really surrendering, forget-
ting your ego and just being present and
telling a story
there's just nothing like
it when it's happening."

Surrendering: Poitras uses the word as
if she had fallen into her success. As if she
were watching a film instead of making
one. Watching, of course, is how her love
of movies developed: "Like, Mean Streets
by Scorcese when I was 15. Everything
about it a dark theater with popcorn
and seeing and watching an image as a
story unfolded in front of me
it's one
of the best experiences. It's still com-
pletely satisfying." Her cinematic taste
ranges widely, from classic movies to
the avant-garde genre in which she was
trained. Her mantra is simple. She asks
of films
her own and others'
only
one
thing:


IN A CLOSET-SIZED ROOM in the Yale
Digital Media Center for the Arts, seven
students
all female
are engaged in
a heated debate. The members of this
year-long documentary film workshop,
designed for Film Studies senior projects
(although only two rn.embers of the class
are in the major), are discussing their ap-
proach to a group documentary on the
November 4 elections. As the conversa-
tion jumps from the significance ofNew
Haven's homeless population to the Sci-
ence Hill cupcake cart, Poitras listens in-
tently, resting her chin on her hands. As
a guest professor, Poitras has stepped into

the shoes of documentary greats like D.
A. Pennebaker, who traditionally teaches
this class. But Poitras speaks unassurn-
ingly, like an eighth student, and the stu-
dents interrupt her just as often as they
interrupt each other. This is group brain-
storm: relaxed and free of hierarchy.

'Just, like, surrender. And if
it doesn't turn out, it's really
okay?" The class laughs guilt-
ily, caught in the act.

Near the end of the class, once the
group has agreed, mostly, on a plan of
action for their election documentary,
Poitras gently moves back into teach-
ing mode. "Just, like, surrender. And if
it doesn't turn out, it's really okay?" The
class laughs guiltily, caught in the act.
"Try to make it observational and not
interject too much. Surrender to what-
ever happens."

She tells a story. To make My Country,
My Country, which centers on the 2005
elections for the Iraqi Transitional Na-
8
tiona! Assembly, Poitras filmed in Iraq
for eight months, mostly living with
and shadowing a middle-class Baghdad
physician and local activist named Dr.
Riyadh. In the film, Dr. Riyadh runs
for the Baghdad Provincial Council as a
member of the Sunni-run Iraqi Islamic
Party. When the Sunni leadership decides
to boycott the elections, Dr. Riyadh still
seems committed to voting. But on elec-
tion day
the climax of Poitras's work-
Or. Riyadh stays horne, sending his wife
and children to vote alone.

"So Dr. Riyadh
the day of the elec-
tion I had gotten permission to go to
the polling center with him ... and then
he totally didn't go out, he didn't leave
the house? And I was like, my film is
ruined!" Everyone laughs. "The film is
ruined, nothing happened, because my
main character is chicken. And I called
my producer and I was like, 'It's terrible.
It's terrible, he didn't go out.' " Though
some of the students begin their own
conversation, Poitras continu.es in her
usual quiet way. "But then after, I real-
ized: It actually made the story more
tragic. It's kind of like this surrender, like
you have these ' certain expectations that
things are going to be a certain way ... but
other things can happen that might be
more interesting. So just go with it."

The class chews on this. Then a girl
asks, "How many minutes are we shoot-
ing for?" Poitras laughs. The girl adds,
"Just
relax," Poitras says. "Totally re-
lax.


FoR PoiTRAS, ARTISTIC surrender opens
the door to action. "There's a certain kind
of magic that happens," she explains.
"When you're filming something and
there's some kind of dramatic moment
happening, I'll climb buildings; I'm to-
tally not shy. When I have a camera in
my hand I sort of become another per-
son." The camera is her superhero cape,
but it brings her closer to, not farther
from, reality.

She wants her students to climb
buildings, too, if not leap atop them in
a single bound. She likes that the class is
about "making things" instead of talking
about them. The class jokes about per-
suading construction workers on Science
Hill to lift a student or two in a crane,
high above treetops, for a bird's-eye shot
of the city. They are only half-kidding.
Filmmaking requires "just jumping into
the world," Poitras says, "stepping out-
side your comfort zone" into a reality
that defies theory.

She loves the play between what she
expects to happen and what actually hap-
pens in front of her camera lens. Between
documentary filmmaking as real-time
movie watching
not so different from
Mean Streets at 15
and as a controlled
artistic act. She made .My Country, My
Country both to record history and to
offer her own vision of the war in Iraq.
It was a visceral urge, she explains, "like
when you feel like you need to say some-
thing." Even when she wears her cape,
she remains half-Clark, half-Superman.

In perhaps her most superhuman
feat, Poitras shot most of My Country,
My Country in a language she couldn't
understand. Filming subjects in Arabic
without a translator, she worked by feel,
using her instinct partly as a filmmaker,
but mostly, she claims, as a human be-
ing. "I pretty much know, 'This moment
is going to be good.' There's something
about human drama that you can almost
see in a clearer way when you don't know
the language.'' Still, once back in Amer-
ica, receiving the translation of her foot-
age was "like Christmas. Or Ramadan,
or whatever."

In the last scene of My Country, My
Country, after Dr. Riyadh hears that he
has lost the election, he stands in the
doorway of his living room speaking to
his wife and daughters, who smile and
"Bravo, bravo.
I knew it was the
last scene," Poitras recalls. "I thought it
was a save-the-day kind of thing." To
Poitras, the family seemed to be honor-
ing their father for his heroic efforts to
help his country. The eventual translation
shocked her: Dr. Riyadh, the stubborn
patriot, announces to his family that he
wants to leave the country. His all-female
audience responds: Bravo, Riyadh, you
finally came to your senses! While film-
ing the scene, Poitras says, "I didn't know
it was sarcasm, so I completely misread
the situation
but it was still the end of
the film."

She was both right and wrong, in con-
trol and in surrender.
