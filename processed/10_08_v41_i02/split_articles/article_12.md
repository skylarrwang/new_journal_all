**LIQUOR RUN**

Social settings can often be used as ball-
park barometers for our nation's overall 
health. Judging from what I saw on Met-
ro-North's Bar Car last week, America 
may be in for a rough ride. 


The Bar Car is exactly that: a single 
coach that sells copious amounts of al-
cohol to businessmen on their way 
home to their families in Connecticut. 
Metro-North has nine of them, and tP,ey 
run weekdays during the evening rush.: 


They're a lot like regular cars, but in~tead; 
of seats they have a bar and cocktail-
style lounging arrangements. During' 
the commute, a few lonely people dot 
the circular seating areas near the often-
faulty bathrooms, and everyone else 
packs into the middle of the car, near the 
bar. As is true for all the other Metro~ 
North cars, the lights are fluorescent and 
the floor is dirty. There is also strange, 
jungle-themed bamboo wallpaper. 


The first time. I rode the Bar Car, I 
disembarked inspired and more than a 
little unsteady. It was this past summer, 
I was leaving New York, and all around 
me merry businessmen on their evening 
~ommutes home were getting riotously, 
Inexcusably drunk. Everyone called out 
to people by their first names. I ordered 
a Heineken, and another, and another. 
1he roorii was full of half-tied ties and 
market banter. The toilet overflowed. I 
Watched a balding man seduce a beauti--
ful woman. 


But that was before Merrill, before Le-
hman, before September and bailouts,. iri 
the halcyon days of summe~ 2008. When 
the "fundamentals" of our economy w.ere 
still strong, even if they weren't. Before . 
this fall, the greatest challenge the Bar 
Cars faced was the possibility of Metro-
North closing them down, which would 
have happened in 2007 had not dozens 
of brave commuters signed a petition to 
save them. But as I rode the booze ex-
press back to New Haven, it became ap-
parent that the already-endangered Bar 
Cars and the financial titans whom 
they water 
face dizzying problems ih 
the months ahead . 


The first tip: The car was nearly empty; 
I was one of eight passengers. The second 
tip: There were no women. Before we left, 
an old lady stepped in briefly, laughed, 
and walked away. Another ordered a gin 
and tonic and scuttled off to the front 
of the train. From an anthropological 
standpoint, any open social setting'--
especially an alcoholic one-devoid of 
gender diversity is probably unhealthy. 


Things were not looking good. 


People loosened their ties and brood-
ed silently. No one knew anyone's name. 
"It's like being in a really shitty jungle 
club drinking beer out of plastic bottles," 
~ne man told me. The floor looked grim-
Ier than usual, and the smell of disinfec-
tants and old urine 
so charming in the 
cargo-hold crowding of earlier days:-
just seemed tired. 


Gone were the shouts of frat-boys-
!- gone-Wall-Street; instead, a man com-
plimented my copy of Blood Meridian. 
I grimaced 
I didn't come to the bar car 
for literary companionship. 


I noticed that the beer prices, long 
admired for their consistency, had been 
slightly raised. I asked the bartender if 
people were drinking more now that the 
economy was bad. She looked at me and 
shook her head, but I suspected a differ-
ent story. 


As the car slowly emptied, I thought 
about my Bar Car frolic not so long ago. 
Where were the drunken analysts, their 
ties flung over their shoulders? Where 
were the puddles of Sam Adams on the 
floor, racing toward the back of the train? 
We passed Westport and I was the only 
one left. I was getting nervous. We were 
hurtling into darkness, the Bar Car a 
seeming symbol for a state in decline. I 
needed another beer. When I got up to 
the bar, my Stella was $3.50. I was a dol-
lar short.
