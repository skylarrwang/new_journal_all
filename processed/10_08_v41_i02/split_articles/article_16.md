spoke at the conference, was an anti-nu-
clear activist for years before a religious 
conversion led him to locate new moral 
stakes in his cause. Now, he explains that 
America's nuclear arsenal sets the coun-
try "squarely in the face of the wrath and 
judgment of God." He currently works 
for Faithful Security, a coalition group 
that bridges faith communities to pur-
StJ.e nuclear nonproliferation, and warns 
that the US government "seeks to elevate 
America above that which God has or-
dained any nation to be."

Stevenson was one of the younger, and 
louder, conference participants. ''I'm 
sure someone here thinks I'm a zealot," 
he mused during a coffee break after 
his speech, though this doesn't prevent 
him from avidly expressing his views; 
"A country considering nuclear weap-
ons," he explained, "needs only to look 
at North Korea on one hand, and Iraq on 
the other, and see the indisputable ad-
vantage of acquiring a nuclear weapon. 
Those trained in business might rightly 
call this an incentive 
and it will cause a 
catastrophe beyond imagining." 

A year after graduating from the Di-
vinity School, Stevenson was one of a 
handful of spiritual leaders who, under 
Coffin's guidance, sparked the genesis 
of this year's conference. In the summer 
of 2005, Coffin invited roughly a dozen 
friends, colleagues, and scholars, Steven-
son included, to his house in Vermont 
to discuss how the religious community 
could mobilize to eliminate the existence 
of nuclear weapons. The chap1ain died 
the next year. 

John Lindner, who now produces a 
YDS magazine called Reflections, was 
also present in Vermont. When Lindner 
speaks of Coffin, it is with a sense of ven-
eration 
as though the reverend were at 
once a movie star, a prophet, a sage, and 
a best friend. "Bill said, 'I'm an old man, 
I'm dying, but come to my house and 
we'll talk about this,"' Lindner recalled. 
The ideas spawned during this intimate 
gathering eventually grew into this fall's 
conference as well as a nuclear-themed 
issue of Reflections to be published this 
spnng. 

Lindner's magazine highlights a pro-
gressive strain of thought thriving on the 
Sterling Divinity Quadrangle. Articles 
titled "Jesus of Hollywood" and Scrip-
ture in the Digital Age" suggest that the 
Divinity School has not forgotten its 
forward-thinking heyday; recent issues 
have centered on how sex, immigration, 
foreign policy, and environmentalism in-
teract with issues of faith. 

In a high-profile academic move, 
the Divinity School drew Tony Blair to 
New Haven to teach a course on "Faith 
and Globalization" with YDS Profes-
sor Miroslav Volf, who played a large 
role in organizing September's confer-
ence. Volf spoke at the beginning of the 
conference, noting the ways technology 
and the modern world have revolution-
izcd what it means to be unsafe. Nuclear 
weapons, Volf insisted, threaten world 
security, and a more insecure world 
means a world further from the biblical 
ideal of Jerusalem, a "city that is utterly 
and completely secure, and can never be 
conquered or undone." 

Professor Jonathan Schell, a longtime 
advocate for nuclear disarmament who 
teaches a course in Yale's Political Sci-
ence Department tided "Strategic, Po-
litical, and Moral Dilemmas of the Nu-
clear Age," lent rhe conference an overtly 
political presence. "We're overdue for a 
profound reconsideration of this issue," 
Schell noted. His comment applied not 
only to Yale, bur roan entire nation about 
to move on from the nuclear-friendly 
policies of the Bush administration and, 
perhaps, beginning to question the need 
for any country-including the United 
Stares-co possess nuclear weapons. 

The national conversation may, in 
fact, be changing. Last January, in a WaU 
Strut journal editorial penned by for-
mer policy heavyweights George Shultz, 
William Perry, Sam Nunn, and Henry 
Kissinger-hardJy a hippy activist him-
self--called for a world without nuclear 
weapons. It was signed by almost all liv-
ing former Secretaries of Defense, sug-
gesting a rising ride for nuclear reform. 
"They could hardly be bigger chunks of 
establishmenr," Schell observes of the 
four authors, "and they're calling for the 
abolition of nuclear weapons." 

The Divinity School hopes that it can_ 
add fuel to the fire. As a university in-
creasingly plugged in to global power dy-
namics, it wasn't long before Yale began 
to tackle what Schell calls "the mother of 
all global issues." That it was the Divin-
ity School that assumed this task, Schell 
believes, is not surprising. "We need all 
hands on deck," he says. "And that very 
much .. .includes religious bodies. These 
are questions of cosmic, spiritual impor-
tance--and philosophical importance." 

When Robert Oppenheimer saw 
the first atomic explosion at the Trin-
ity Test, he remembered a passage from 
the Bhagavad Gita: "If the radiance of a 
thousand suns were to burst at once into 
the sky, that would be like the splendor 
of the mighty one. Now I am become 
Death, the destroyer of worlds." Like 
Oppenheimer, parnctpants in Septem-
ber's conference have come to see nuclear 
weapons as a spiritual as well as a political 
issue. The Divinity School is formulating 
a New Testament for a post-nuclear age.
