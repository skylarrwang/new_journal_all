EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Come a little closer, baby 
pull your 
barstool over, lean in, inhale the haze of 
cigarettes and perfume so thick it'll make 
your throat burn 
and Phoenix will tell 
you everything you want to know. 
She'll tell you about her parents, who 
hate her job of course but stand by her 
because stripping is just a temporary 
thing and they support her no matter 
what because that's just the way they are, 
y'know. She'll tell you about what she re-
ally wants to do, which is become a po-
lice officer, after maybe another month 
of this bullshit so she can pay her way 
through college. She'll tell you about her 
tattoos-dark, angular stars blooming on 
her shoulder blades 
which are a tribute 
to her family. And if you hang around 
long enough, she'll tell you about her 
three-year-old son, Junior, who thinks 
she's a waitress, although he doesn't re-
ally understand much of anything yet.

Phoenix is 21 but her low, serrated 
voice makes her sound older. She is wear-
ing fishnets and a dog collar necklace. 
with spikes. There is a wad of bills tucked 
into her underwear string. Her heels are 
so dizzyingly high that I can't stop staring 
at them. My scuffed flip-flops look really 
unsexy in comparison. Phoenix smiles 
and stands, her legs unfolding endlessly. 
"This is a tiny bit of fame, a tiny bit 
of celebrity," she says. "It makes you feel 
good about yourself, to be watched, to 
be admired, adored by others." 

Meanwhile, I can feel the eyes on me: 
....... W..,hat's up with this chick? Ayyyee she's 
from Yaaale. Girl, look at her squirm. 
At East Street's Catwalk Club, which 
opened in 1996, the electric pulse of hip-
hop and pop and rock is in the air till 
5 a.m. and chandeliers throw spangled 
shadows on the walls. The pole reflects 
constellations of colored lights. At the 
bar, the off-duty girls cross their legs and 
sip Red Bull, casting sultry looks through 
thick black lashes. 
"My favorite part of this place is the 
naked women," says Toni, a construction 
worker who comes to Catwalk at least 
once a week. His least favorite part, he 
tells me, is leaving. 

'My favorite part of this place 
is the naked women, " says 
Tom, a cons-truction worker 
who comes to Catwalk at 
least once a week. His least 
-avorite part, he tells me, is 
leaving. 

"You get all different kinds of people in 
here," says Mark Rhatigan, the manager. 


The older businessmen come in early, 
watch hungrily from the outskirts of the 
room, eyes big and glazed behind their 
glasses. The college kids come in .real late, . 
after 2 a.m. Sometimes they get a little 
too aggressive with the girls, but Mark, a 
former bouncer, doesn't let that fly. 
Mark was in the army for five years. 
He is round-shouldered with a greased 
coif and huge pees that strain . against a 
tight black shirt. He looks like he could 
break your face without even trying. 
"It's the worst when a guy tries to touch 
you," says Valentina, who is 27 and has 
a big, brassy voice. Her hair is a crunchy 
orange cloud. She used to workas.a com-Â· 
puter teacher but got laid off. "I went to 
school for almost three years, I'm certi-
fied at Microsoft, and I work in a strip 
club," she says. "I mean that showwws -
you something, baby girl. Come onnn." 
Running her tongue over her teeth, she 
adds, "The economy sucks."

Serenity is 19 and skinny and about 
my height 
five-foot-three 
except for 
' 
the heels. Her eyes are thickly lined and 
winged at the edges, Cleopatra-style. She 
wears a black corset and huge hoop ear- . 
rings and has a dented pack ofNewports 
tucked into her garter. There's no hourly 
wage for exotic dancers; they earn what-
ever customers decide to give them. Still, 
the pay is solid, Serenity says. She's made 
two thousand dollars in a good week. 
But she can't stand the slow nights. 
When one or two guys saunter in, sit 
at the bar, sip drinks, and pay no mind 
to the girls.. She's grinding up and down 
that pole for 15 minutes and basically 
dancing for no reason. Nothing pisses 
her off more than being ignored. Later, I 
watch her walk from the bar to the stage. 
She is slow, slinking, like a cat. Her small 
hips sway fiercely. 
The music starts up, low and sassy. 
Dontcha wish your girlfriend was hot 
like me. 
Serenity steps onto the platform and 
caresses the pole. When she bends over, 
a college boy in the front row leans for-
ward, snaps the string of her underwear, 
and slips in a bill. She swivels towards 
him, her long legs opening slowly like a 
fan. He is hypnotized, and she locks eyes 
with him and won't look away. 
Dontcha wish your girlfriend was a 
freak like me. 

In the corner of the room, I am perched 
on the edge of a big velvet chair, feeling 
small and clumsy. I could never pull off 
those heels. I don't have the swagger. Or 
the legs. The way she owns every inch of 
that stage, works every inch of the pole. 
My neck is itching and all I want to do 
is be out in the cold, quiet night. Jesus, 
I feel dumb in this prissy sweater, these 
neat, hemmed jeans. 

In the corner o the room, I 
am perched on the edge o a 
big velvet chair, feeling small 
and clumsy. I could never 
pull of those heels. I don't 
have the swagger. Or the 
legs. 

I know you want me, its easy to see. 
Their eyes are saying what the hell are 
you doing out here, with your tape re-
corder and your button-down top and 
your stupid half-smile? Walk in walk 
out, cap your pen and all that's left of 
us is the cigarette smoke in your hair. 
Phoenix says, we're all just trying to find 
our place. It's hard. Money is money. 
And she laughs loud, too loud, and one 
heel catches on the edge of the carpet. 
She leans on the pool table and stares at 
me. Her makeup looks clownish under 
the bright lamps. 
But onstage, where the music pounds 
and the light melts blue, she is smooth, 
so smooth, and when her eyes catch you, 
baby, you can't stop watching.
