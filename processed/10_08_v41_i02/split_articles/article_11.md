They amass: dented green beads one 
pea-hater culled from a plate of penne; 
French fries soggy with ketchup; the 
crisp curled edges of a cheese omelet. 


Every few hours, an army of leftovers 
retreats on gray trays into Yale kitch-
ens, where the food residue, unseen and 
forgotten by those responsible for it, is 路 
washed down the drain. 


Yale handles five hundred tons of bio-
degradable dining hall waste each year. 


Unlike pantry waste (expired bread or 
rotten tomatoes), preparation food waste 
(turkey trimmings), and serving waste 
(that tray of lasagna that sat out for 
hours), plate waste doesn'r usually end 
up in the dumpster. Instead, as food is 
scraped off plates, special pulpers, filters, 
or floating tanks 
the precise technol-
ogy varies by college 
catch the residue, 
which is then pumped out by an inde-
pendent disposal company hired by Yale. 


The remaining greasy mess is sent to 
the Water Pollution Control Authority, 
which treats the water before sending it 
on its way to Long Island Sound. 


This fall, a composting pilot program 
run by the Yale Recycling Office aimed 
to alter that time-honored journey. From 
the start of the fall term until October 
10, leftover meals, peels, rinds, bones, 
wooden stirrers, napkins, and other 
biodegradable dining accessories from 
Commons and the Branford, Saybrook, 
and Twmbull dining halls were rerouted 
for compost collection. 


Composting addresses 
solid, 
un-
touched food that would otherwise 
be thrown out as well as the food, oil, 
and grease (affectionately acronymed 
FOG) that washes off plates. As lare as 
1990, Yale sent both kinds of waste to 
local pig farmers, who happily fed it ' 路 
to their hogs. One such farmer would 
tote a 55-gallon drum on top of his car 
to pick up liquid food slop from Com-
mons. But both farmers and dining hall . 路 
workers grew dissatisfied with the ar-
rangements. Moreover, the pig farming 
industry was in decline, and with the 
advent of trichinosis, a disease circulated 
by infected meat, Connecticut forbade 
livestock from ingesting post-consumer 
food that hadn't been thermally treated. 


The last farmer who continued to pick 
up food from Yale eventually opted for 
Dunkin' Donuts instead: his pigs liked 
the doughnuts, and they were legal, far-路 
tening, and dry. 


Yale's current food waste isn't pretty. 


Under this fall's pilot program, about 
1,500 pounds of decaying food waste 
from Commons alone waited for each 
thrice-weekly 
pick-up. . Dining 
hall 
workers say they didn't mind the new 
system. After all, rotting food was noth-
ing new, even if it was going into a dif-
ferent place. 


Under the new program, the food 
waste Was sucked up by John?s Refuse 
and Recycling trucks and transported to 
New Milford, 65 miles from Yale, where 
it composted for sixty days before being 
transformed into fertilizer. Yale's leftover 
food thus became part of a process that 
changed food waste to pure organic top-
soil. "The food was wonderful," says CJ 
May. "Now we're making it wonderful 
again." May is Yale's recycling coordi-
nator, outspoken and energetic, with 
rolled-up sleeves and a grey ponytail. His 
cluttered office in the basement ofWelch 
Hall is decorated with shirts reading, 
"TALK TRASH TO ME." 


May shares a vision for Yale's trashy 
future in which he would take a pile of 
fertilizer made from the University's food 
waste and dump it in Beinecke Plaza 
with a sign informing students, "This is 
Where Your Food Went." He admits that 
"it's hard to get philosophical" about 
composting. "When it comes down to 
it, it's numbers." But it's also education. 


May recalls the day a woman attending 
a composting demonstration he hosted 
picked up a handful of compost after-
math and finally understood that the 
beautiful, rich soil she held in her hands 
came from food. That day, May says, 
"she got it." 


For now, the biggest hurdle to cam-
pus-wide composting is Yale's lack of 
local facilities and infrastructure to ac-
commodate its food waste. In an attempt 
to fill part of this gap, the University is 
planning a trial with the Somat eCorrect 
Waste Reducer. The new system would 
take some time to set up (the machines, 
which are as big as compact cars, require 
a lot of space) and much capital invest-
ment (a single machine for average use 
will cost up to $16,000) but it would en-
able Yale to do one step of com posting on 
its own. The Somat reduces the volume 
and weight of food by about 80 percent, 
with distilled water as a byproduct. The 
final product is thus dry 
not "yucky," 
according to May. Since it is not pure 
compost and probably cannot be directly 
used as fertilizer, no one has figured out 
what to do with the devolumized waste. 


Still, the reasoning goes, one hundred 
tons of food waste is at least better than 
five hundred. 


Most Yalies, however, never noticed 
the pilot program happening under their 
noses. As dining hall workers obligingly 
ran the show backstage, Yale diners were 
held no more responsible for their waste 
than before. Despite May's fond memo-
ries of those who "got it," the army of 
food waste marches on, untouched by its 
creators.
