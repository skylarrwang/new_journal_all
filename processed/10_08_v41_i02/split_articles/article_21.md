to the early 1960s to have as happy a 
department [as we have now]," he says. 
He credits the new departmental chair, 
Michael Della Rocca, with alleviating 
tension and congratulates him on his lat-
est faculty hires. New professors like Ste-
phen Darwal and Thomas Pogge bring a 
focus on political science and psychology 
to their studies; "They have made this a 
more interesting place," Harries says. 
"We are broadening, building bridges." 
Professor Della Rocca agrees with 
Harries' positive assessment of the de-
partment. "It's in a really good position 
now," he says, although "it took a while 
for it to rebuild itself." Looking back on 
the '80s, Della Rocca finds the intra-de-
partmental disagreements "sort of trivial. 
We've moved -beyond that totally." 


For those who mourn the dearth of 
continental philosophers at Yale, or even 
broad intellectual history courses, Della 
Rocca believes that the era of fierce di-
• 
vjsjons between phHosophic disciplines, 
like the era of departmental conflict, has 
passed. "The divisions between so-called 
'analytical' and so-called 'continental' 
philosophy 
those divisions are mean-
ingless now," he says. Della Rocca cites 
interdisciplinary initiatives as proof of 
a new era of collaboration. Pogge's ap-
pointment, for example, was made pos-
sible by the MacMillian Center for Inter-
national and Area Studies, and Benhabib 
brought philosophy and ethics experts 
to campus during her tenure as director 
of the Ethics, Politics, and Economics · 
major. Directed Studies, the interdisci-
plinary freshman program that teaches 
the Western canon, links the philosophy 
department to other majors and focuses 
\argely on the continental tradition. 


THOUGH THE PHILOSOPHY department 
aims to replace Harries with another 
expert in 19th-century philosophy, the 
old definitions of philosophy 
which 
take Europe as their roots and the con-
tinental tradition as their backbone-
have shifted. With this shift in focus has 
come a shift in preeminence. Instead of a 
select few Ivy-covered institutions domi-
nating the philosophical field, there are 
now several; instead of one or two tradi-
tions dominating the discourse, there are 
now many, and they link disciplines and 
thinkers across the globe. 


Attracting a figure of Harries' stature 
will most certainly be difficult, and even 
if the department replaces him with an-
other continental expert, it will be losing 
the last of the old guard from its days as 
the unquestioned leader among philoso-
phy departments worldwide. The Yale 
Philosophy Department has long been 
asking itself tough questions 
about the 
direction it wants to take, the academic 
role it wants to play 
but when Har-
ries finishes teaching his last course for 
the last time, the department will finally 
have to answer them.
