Clinton across the state's eight counties, 
securing 26 to her 22 delegates and los-
ing by significant margins in Windham 
and New London. For New Haveners at 
the celebration, this disparity became a 
point of hometown pride. "They're say-
ing Connecticut is too close to call," de-
clared the city's Democratic Party Chair-
woman Susie Voigt, "but there's one city 
in Connecticut where it's not too close to 
call. New Haven votes for a progressive 
Democratic outlook." 


The rallying cry for local Democrats 
had gone out months earlier, with a series 
of prescient and well-publicized endorse-
ments for Obama by four New Haven 
aldermen: Ward 1 's Rachel Plattus, Ward 
2's Gina Calder, Ward 15's Joey Rodri-
guez, and Ward 22's Greg Morehead. To-
gether, the team set about, in Rodriguez's 
words, "educating" ambivalent voters 
about Obama's positions on education, 
the economy, and the war in Iraq. The 
push payed off. By February, DeStefano, 
State Representative Rosa DeLauro, and 
numerous other aldermen had pledged 
their support. By the time ballots closed 
on the 2nd, all but three ofNew Haven's 
thirty wards had sided with Obama. 


Coinciding with this landslide were 
record numbers in voter registration 
and turnout, specifically amongst the 
city's African Americans. Morehead and 
Calder, both influential advocates for 
the New Haven black community, may 
have galvanized the minority population 
on primary daY: Both aldermen's wards, 
the predominately black Dixwell and 
Dwight neighborhoods, posted five-to-
one sweeps for Obama. "Race plays a 
factor," conceded Rodriguez, himself a 
key force in garne.ring Hispanic support 
for the senator. "There are more expecta-
tions for Obama in black communities. 
This is a historic moment, and Obama is 
the first truly credible African-American 
presidential candidate we have seen." 


If, as DeStefano said, New Haven was 
the reason Obama won the state of Con-
necticut, then the voices of local blacks 
played no small part in winning New 
Haven for Obama. This would mean 
that Obama, attempting to win an elec-
tion by transcending race, won the Con-
necticut primary largely because New 
Haven's black community rose to sup-
port him. 


"PosT-RACIAL POLITICS is a lie. It sounds 
good but it is not real," writes Gary 
Holder-Winfield, New Haven's Demo-
cratic nominee for state representative 
and a rising black leader in the city, in an 
email. He deems talk of race-transcending 
unity, like Shah's hope for taqueed, soph-
istry. Like Abdussabur, Holder-Winfield 
speaks in historical terms. "When did we 
get past race anyway?" he asks. "Certain-
ly it wasn't the sixties because the civil 
rights movement proper was still going 
on then. Not the seventies 
just look at 
the activities of the Panthers or attempts 
to desegregate in Boston or the results of 
people wanting to marry between races 
in Virginia and on and on. . . So, when 
did we get past race to be in a post-racial 
period?" 


Before America can begin to discuss 
the possibility of declaring itself absolved 
of its racial legacy, Holder-Winfield con-
tends, it must first acknowledge and then 
reconcile the damages of that history. 


"If Barack Obama represents anything, 
he represents either the best example of
wearing the mask that I have ever seen or 
he is fundamentally different from other 
politicians, in that he truly believes that 
we can be more than we have been, that 
we can get past race, that America can be 
America for the first time." 


On 
October 6, 
Holder-Winfield 
walked into the common room ofYale's
Branford College flanked by student 
members of the Yale Democrats. Slightly 
short, slightly pudgy, he doesn't cut an 
intimidating figure, but he speaks with a 
self-assurance and calm that inspires in-
stant trust and approachability. The man 
is his mantra 
all politics are identity 
politics 
in practice. "If I can sit down 
at a table with you and talk with you for 
half an hour," he tells the thirty or so as-
sembled students, "you're going to vote 
for me." 


It's an approach Holder-Winfield 
wishes the Democrats would learn to 
embrace. "I truly believe that part of the 
reason Democrats are stunned at our 
losses is a lack of an understanding of 
the power of identity politics ... Obama 
must find a way to connect with the vast
majority by developing a narrative that 
speaks across identities while at the same 
time being able toÂ· tailor that narrative 
to specific audiences without appearing 
to do so." Obama's relatability problem, 
Holder-Winfield continues in his email, 
is amplified by Obama's inherent dis-
similarities to the American majority. 


"Barack Obama is Black, even if he is 
half White, and his skin color is, in our 
country, a natural disconnect. The good 
news to me is that this disconnect can 
be overcome. The problem is whether 
we are dealing with a disconnect or in-
grained racism, which is a gap that will 
not be bridged." 


"~ hope that it means 
Obama will be in the White 
House. But at the end of this 
election:~ there will need to be 
a taqueed:J a uni~ to make 
America a blessed country. :J:J

Having only become active in the 
Obama bid since last spring, when, as 
leader of the Connecticut Federation of 
Black Clubs, he was contacted by the 
campaign to unify Mrican-American 
communities across the state, Holder-
Winfield holds up his own political 
background as proof of the necessity of 
door-to-door campaigning and face-to-
face conversations. Moving at an early 
age from the Bronx to Westbury, Con-
necticut, Holder-Winfield had planned 
on pursuing a career in physics before 
a return visit to his Connecticut home-
town convinced him to change paths. 


"Westbury used to be a place people 
moved to in order to get away from vio-
lence and crime. When I came back for 
my high school reunion, I saw a lot of 
kids getting involved in drugs and gangs. 
I wanted to find a solution, so I started 
getting active in local politics." 


In order to effect change on a commu-
nity level, Holder-Winfield believes, it is 
necessary for politicians to cross cultural 
divides that their constituents are reluc-
tant to bridge on their own. Making a 
rural representative feel that she and her 
supporters have a stake in urban issues 
arising in the state legislature is a neces-
sary step in generating visibility of mi-
nority issues within the larger electorate. 


To Holder-Winfield, this kind of inter-
community dialogue will be necessary 
not only to ensure an Obama victory in 
November, but also to enfranchise black 
citizens who feel that their voices and 
concerns go unheard in the national cau-
cus. "When Black people hear the presi-
dent and other national figures speak 
about America, speak about 'we' and 'us,' 
we are not sure that Blacks are included 
in that narrative," Holder-Winfield ex-
plains. "Truth be told many of us are 
sure we are not." 


Like Abdussabur, Holder-Winfield be-
lieves that Obama owes Mrican Ameri-
cans specific representation. With a 
black man in the White House, he ex-
plains, there will inevitably be more pres-
sure from minorities for the president to 
advocate on behalf of underrepresented 
and underprivileged sectors of American 
society. "We are going to expect that an 
Obama who has based his campaign on 
'change that you can believe in' means 
just that," Holder-Winfield declares. 


"We are going to expect that as president 
Obama is as adept at speaking to Blacks 
as he was as a candidate at speaking to 
Whites. Does he owe us a revolution? 
No. But he does owe us representation." 


Abdussabur registers a similar senti-
ment, explaining, "The black commu-
nity has written Barack a check. That 
check is for outreach and the amount is 
for change. And I believe when Obama 
wins in November, Mrican Americans 
will see that check cashed." 


ON TuESDAY, OcTOBER 7, the eve of 
the second Presidential debate, the New 
Haven Democratic campaign office offi-
cially opened. Within the cramped one-
room space at 900 Chapel Street, phone 
banks were set up, voter-registration 
forms handed out, and a huge macaroni-
and-sandwich buffet consumed by local 
Democratic leaders and a selection of 
mostly-white students and mostly-black 
Elm City residents. A dry-erase board 
with sign-ups for canvassing trips to New 
Hampshire was nearly filled. A little girl 
walked from person to person handing 
out "Obama/Biden '08" buttons. 


Susie Voigt, walking with a cane, took 
the microphone to thank volunteers for 
their long hours and devotion to the 
candidate. Many of the volunteers had 
joined the cause in the past few weeks, 
though one woman had been working 
with the campaign since late 2006. "It's a 
great time to be a Democrat," the chair-
woman intoned. "We're making history 
in rooms like this." 


ccWhen did we get past race 
anyway?" 
-Gary Holder-Winfield 


Later, Congresswoman Rosa DeLaura 
delivered a fist-pumping ultimatum to 
the crowd: "This is the first time in a 
while that people believe that there can 
be a new politics. There is no choice but 
winning on November 4." 


A father sitting in the back row of the 
audience cradled his baby daughter and 
whispered into her ear, "Yes, we can." 


Indeed, since February, New Haven 
has shown that, yes, it can join together 
to rally behind a candidate, to attract 
previously disenchanted voters, to play 
a decisive role in achieving an Obama 
victory in November. But to view this or 
any other city's support of America's first 
black presidential nominee as somehow 
of one mind or motivated out of a col-
lective racial consciousness is not only 
myopic: It is dangerous. New Haven's 
black leaders, although nearly unani-
mous in their support for Obama, never-
theless approach him with vastly diverse 
expectations and reservations. To claim 
that Obama is black America's choice 
for '08 not only undermines the prom-
ise of post-racial politics but ideologi-
cally shortchanges minority leaders who 
have combated racism their entire lives. 
Abdussabur, Shah, and Holder-Winfield 
may fall within the same census demo-
graphic, but to halt analysis at a racial 
category is to deny the possibility of dis-
cussing race in a meaningful way. After 
November 4, the question for not only 
New Haven but the country at large 
must not be which groups voted for 
whom, but why individuals went to the 
polls and why one candidate appealed 
to them over another. Even when we 
see consensus in a community, we must 
understand that such consensus is im-
perfect, varied, and composed of dispa-
rate needs and desires for change. Then, 
and only then, can this country begin to 
speak of itself as post-racial. 


After the speeches, the modest crowd 
dispersed into the chill autumn night, 
talking of the debate to come, carpool-
ing plans to a rally in Hartford, the suc-
cesses and failures of that night's phone 
drive. Parents walked home with their 
kids while others made their way to de-
bate parties sponsored by the headquar-
ters. Whatever the candidacy of Barack 
Obama means to these volunteers, rep-
resentatives, politicians, and citizens, 
both white and black, they have united 
in New Haven's own microcosmic taqu'e-
ed, at least for the moment, to get him 
elected.
