BUILDING BLOCKS 
New Haven models new development on an old urban ideal. 
John DeStefano is a development man. 
Since his mayoral inauguration in 1993, 
his administration has directed billions 
of dollars, year after year, to rebuilding 
New Haven-gutting and renovating its 
schools, developing blighted neighbor-
hoods through the Livable City Initia-
tive, and revitalizing empty business dis-
tricts like Orange Street and the Ninth 
Square. DeStefano sees his work as a 
march toward the future, but the future 
he envisions is very much like the New 
Haven of 90 years ago: a living, walking, 
and working urban environment with a 
dense and vigorous downtown, a popu-
lation center that will lure outsiders into 
New Haven on Friday nights. At the core 
of his vision is the revival, through eco-
nomic development and infrastructure 
improvement, of an urban middle class 
that vanished decades ago in many pock-
ets of urban America. 

The latest step toward this future 
was taken on a crisp morning this Sep-
tember, when bulldozers and backhoes 
moved in to officially break ground on 
the site of the long-defunct Shartenberg's 
department store. In its place will rise a 
cutting-edge, 32-story housing and com-
mercial complex. The top floors of this 
mixed-use building, the so-called 360 
State Street project, will hold a collection 
of luxury rental apartments, while the 
ground floor will include twenty thou-
sand square feet of retail space, including 
a grocery store. On the terrace will be a 
swimming pool, a rooftop garden, a fit-
ness center, even a library. Nearly every 
aspect of the design 
from its recycled 
and local materials and Energy Star ap-
pliances to a fuel-cell generator that will 
produce clean, renewable power 
will 
be green enough to earn the building a 
coveted Gold LEED certification. 

7he 360 State project rep-
resents the first large-scale 
development in New Haven 
since the ambitious urban 
renewal schemes of the 1950s 
and :J60s. 

"I designed [the project] wtth the in-
tent to attract well-educated young pro-
fessionals," says the project's developer 
and architect, Bruce Becker. He wants 
360 State Street to become an urban hub 
serving "lots of little markets 
faculty 
and staff at Yale New-Haven Hospital, 
attorneys ~orking downtown, young 
professionals who commute out of the 
city by train, graduate students with the 
means, and retired people who want to 
be downtown."
