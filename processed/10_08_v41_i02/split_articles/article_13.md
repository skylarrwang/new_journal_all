BARN IN THE USA 
Not yet weathered by the elements, 
the light lumber frame stood. A small 
band of students and a few professional 
builders, distinguished as much by their 
confidence on ladders as their yellow 
shirts, balanced atop the slats of the 
newly-raised roof. The whir of a single 
drill jarred me out of the idyllic scene, 
void of technology until the sound of 
the tool. This September Saturday had 
drawn a crowd of local families, scrag-
gly students, and sustainable building 
enthusiasts to see the raising of the Yale 
Farm's new pavilion. 


The event 
billed as a barn raising 
despite the fact that the open structure 
is more roof than barn 
signaled both a 
beginning and an end at the Farm. The 
following Friday, Josh Viertel, co-found-
er and co-director of the Yale Sustainable 
Food Project, left New Haven to become 
the president of Slow Food USA. The pa-
vilion was his last nourishing contribu-
tion to the Yale community. 


Just eight years after Viertel'sÂ·arrival at 
Yale, the Yale Farm and the Sustainable 
Food Project have become an integral 
part of Yale's culture and educational 
philosophy. The farm is about more than 
just food production: "It's an educational _ 
facility," said Viertel. ''And to maximize 
education, we needed a space for educat-
ing on a rainy day, a place where our stu-
dents can find shade, a structure that al-
lows us to gather together for workshops, 
for community." They needed a "barn." 


Cpnstruction of the pavilion evolved 
from sustainable ethics, or the desire to 
minimize environmental impact and 
support local industries. To ensure that 
construction of this educational space 
was educational in practice, Viertel and 
his colleagues had students do it them-
selves. 


A traditional barn raising might look 
something like this: Farmer Jebediah 
needs a barn, so he calls some buddies 
(sans phone, of course 
it is the 18th 
century), the whole community moseys 
on down, dears the ground, lays in the 
lumber and hardware, and, with a series 
of collective "heave-hos," lifts each beam 
into place. Now imagine that Jebediah is 
your roommate, invitations are sent via 
email, and the community treks up Sci-
ence Hill. The "barn-raising" at the Yale 
Farm was as authentic as it could have 
been, given the century. Using ropes, a 
dozen screws, and that old-fashioned, 
can-do colonial spirit, the barn was 
raised entirely by hand. 


Brendan Matthews, the head of the 
Barn Raisers, a professional team of 
sure-footed, yellow-shirted experts who 
guided Yalies as they tripped over ropes 
and attempted not to hammer their fin-
gers, attended his first barn-raising at 13. 
He was so moved by the communal con-
struction of something tangible that he 
knew he wanted to build barns (or pavil-
ions, as the case may sometimes be) for 
the rest of his life. 


Viertel felt a similar thrill at the 
September event. "This shows us what 
communities can accomplish," he said . 
"Something as elementary as picking up 
one of these support slabs is impossible 
for a single pair of hands. But together 
we built this." 


The barn is the most sustainable build-
ing on campus: With no insulation, elec-
tricity, or plumbing, its carbon footprint 
is negligible. It also may be the building 
which most belongs to Yale. What we 
think of as Yale architecture is not Yale's 
but rather imitation Cambridge and 
Oxford, complete with acid-aged stone. 


Lacking four walls and a floor, the pavil-
ion does not pretend to be anything it 
is not (except, perhaps, a barn). Its lum-
ber originated in the Yale Forest, where 
Forestry School students marked and, 
with the help of a team of undergrads, 
cut trees. Shaped and erected by Yale 
hands, the pavilion is a structure ofYale, 
by Yale, and for Yale. 


At the communal dinner after the rais-
ing, food and flowers stretched from the 
pavilion to the street. As the sky dark-
ened, barn raisers and curious onlookers 
alike gathered under the new pavilion for 
a good old-fashioned contra dance. "The 
building held this incredible energy," re-
flected Viertel. "The barn just worked. 
And I realized, in that moment, that I 
could step out and all this will continue. 
It has its own energy now." 


Since that day, the traditional pine 
branch nailed to the barn's roof, a talis-
man for long life, has already started to 
break apart. When it finally detaches, the 
pavilion will stand as ifit has always been 
there, rooting us to Yale and Yale to the 
land.
