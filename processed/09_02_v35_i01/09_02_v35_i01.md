EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
On September 12, 2001, we were told that everything was suddenly simpler. 
Battle lines were clearly drawn. Moral questions were obvious. This clarity heralded a "sea-change" from the troubling ambiguity of the decadent age that had 
ended the previous morning. We had emerged from a "haze of relativisim," and 
stepped into a new world painted boldly in black and white. 

In the flood of prophesy and pronouncement, the self-appointed arbiters of public 
opinion and the public ethos offered up Yale and its students as prime evidence of 
the awakening. David Brooks, pundit and "public intellectual," came to Yale looking 
for bright-eyed visionaries and, to no one's surprise, discovered exactly that. 

Before, we were lost, unprepared by environment and education to make firm decisions or "construct moral arguments." Those days of last fall signaled better times 
to come, with simpler thoughts and clearer morals-as Brooks put it, a new wave 
of "judgementalism." 

Brooks was by no means alone in this declaration. Alison Hornstein, then a Yale 
senior, echoed him in the pages of Newsweek. She pointed to "a deficiency in [our] 
generation's ability to make moral judgements," and cast the blame for our collective confusion on academics who had left us woefully unprepared to confront reality. She was no doubt thinking of people like Paul Kennedy. In those strange days, 
Kennedy, by no means a foaming-at-the-mouth radical, became a scarred nation's 
whipping boy for having dared to wonder out loud what the world might have looked 
like through the eyes of those 19 young men. In the process of lambasting Kennedy, 
a Wall Street Journal editorial dubbed Yale students "the best and the brightest" and 
portentously declared that we had found our calling and a clear sense of mission. 

They quoted the editors of the Yale Daily News: "After September 11, 2001, we 
came of age as a generation. We agreed on an agenda." 

What they told us on September 12 was wrong. A year later, our easy consensus, 
moral certitude, and clarity of purpose are gone. Every avowal of simplicity exposes 
a new layer of complexity. Every stab at certainty reveals another question.

The Art of War 
IN A SCENE PROM Alive from Palestine: 
Stories 
Under Occupation, 
a 
couple 
exchanges a bullet and a gas canister as 
tokens of love. Mounds of crumpled news-
papers are the only scenery. The play 
debuted in the United States at New 
Haven's Long WharfTheater in late June as 
part of the annual International Festival of 
Arts and Ideas. It offered New Haveners a 
glimpse of life in Palestine and a rare 
chance to experience Palestinian art first-
hand. The series of dramatic vignettes were 
delivered in Arabic, with English surticles, 
by members of AJ Kasaba, an acting troupe 
based in the West Bank city of Rarnallah. 
Invited to New Haven by Festival organiz-
ers as the second intifada raged in 
Jerusalem, the actors asked their audience 
to "see and hear us as no longer a news item 
but as we are: Palestinians, living, dying, 
crying, laughing, commiserating, strug-
gling for a normal existence against a back-
drop of uncertainty." 

The Festival sponsored the play as part 
of its summer repertoire. Mary Miller, the 
Festival's director, attributed the play's 
selection to its artistic merit. "The criteria 
is artistic excellence," she told The New 
York Times. Before premiering in the 
United States at the Long Wharf, Alive 
from Palestine had played at the London 
International Theatre Festival and was met 
with positive reviews and little controversy. 
Miller saw the play as a good fit with the 
mission of the Festival. But in the weeks 
before Alive from Pakstine opened in New 
Haven, doubtful members of New Haven's 
Jewish community raged at her explana-
tion. 

Their main concern was a state contri-
bution of $1.4 million to the Festival, 
meaning the play-in which Israelis are 
referred to as "the wicked ones" -was 
funded in parr by public dollars. Jewish 
community leaders derided the selection as 
insensitive, inappropriate, and "bigoted" 
and charged that it "demonizes" and 
"stereotypes" Israelis. Critics also protested 
SI!.PTEMBER 2.002. 
that by showing the Palestinian perspective, 
the Festival had the responsibility of show-
ing the Israeli viewpoint as well. Despite 
the claim of AI Kasaba and Festival orga-
nizers-that the play should be viewed 
only as art-David Waren, the regional 
director of the Connecticut office of the 
Anti-Defamation League, described the 
play as "pure political propaganda." 

The play's inclusion sparked a crusade 
against the Festival itself. In The jewish 
udgt'1'-which turned the issue into front-
page news for much of the summer-an 
editorial described Alive from Palestine as "a 
rotten apple that tain 
whole barrel." 

The editorial urged r 
rs to take action: 
"The show should not go on. This play 
should be withdrawn from the program. 
Ask Governor Rowland to do something 
about this now. Call his office at 860-566-
4840." A resident of Waterbury said, "With 
more than 95 percent of the Palestinians in 
the West Bank and Gaza living under their 
own self-government, 'a play about life 
under Israeli occupation' would be appro-
priate for a festival about the art of propa-
ganda, but it is not appropriate for a festi-
val of arts and ideas." 

There was no public 
consensus in the Jewish 
community about what 
course of action should 
have been taken rekard-
ing the play. Editorials 
and letters from Jews 
from all over the New 
Haven area flooded local 
newspapers, calling for a 
wide range of responses. 
Some Jews 'encouraged 
people to see the play, 
stating that ALive from 
Palestine was "necessary 
viewing" and engaged 
people in a civil dialogue 
on the issue. Waren did 
not call for the play's 
withdrawal, 
instead 
demanding that .organizers "achieve a 
degree of balance" by including an equiva-
lent Israeli performance. (At least one local 
Rabbi managed to find a bright side to the 
controversy: "They're making an in 
Rarnallah? How wonderful!") 

In response to the outcry, the Festival 
added a series of post-play discussions to 
provide a forum for debate on the role of 
art in politics and politics in art. (They also 
installed electronic security check-points at 
the theater's entrance.) But the show had to 
go on, or at least that's how Miller saw it. 
And it did, selling out all five nights it was 
performed. 

Alive from Paksti.ne put the Jewish 
community-a demographic not typically 
associated with censorship or conser-
vatism-in an awkward position. The 
Anti-Defamation League, one of the 
groups initially outraged by the play's 
inclusion in the Festival, recognizes the 
importance of free speech when it comes to 
the Ku Klux Klan, a group with an obvious 
political agenda, and adamantly defends 
the right of political extremist groups to 
express hateful views in public. The actors, 
for their part, deny that they have a politi-

cal agenda ar all. Nizar Zuabi, the play's 
director, was dismayed by the controversial 
opening in New Haven. "The play is arr," 
he told the Los Angeles Times. "It is shaped 
by political circumstances, yes, but it is 
art." In fact, some reviewers described the 
play as pretty bland fare. "The company 
has chosen not to make any reference to 
Yasir Arafat or to suicide bombers; that 
seems politically prudent, if nor chicken-
hearted .... There is little in the show chat is 
likely co inflame anyone in any new way," 
Bruce Weber wrote in a review for The New 
York Times. 

In one scene from Alive .from Pakstine, 
a man picks through his son's book bag 
afrer a bomb attack leaves the boy dead. 
The boy may not have been a political 
actor, but fell victim co a war beyond his 
conuol. T he Al Kasaba troupe may have 
arrived in New Haven co perform art, but 
they were swallowed up by a political 
fuestorm they could not contain.

**Kung Fu Fighting**

Kung Fu Fighting 
TH.B MIGHTY NEW HAVEN NINJAS, beloved 
gladiators of arenafootbalh, open every 
event co a fanfare of violins and heavy bass. 
Tonight's opponent, the Scranton/Wilkes-
Barre Pioneers, are shalcing in their tights as 
the Ninjas jog out of the concession stands, 
through two spires of fireworks, and onto 
the field. One spire prophetically fizzles 
and dies; a Ninja pauses, then stoically con-
tinues his uoc. We already know how the 
season will end: The New Haven Coliseum 
will be demolished, and the arena-less 
Ninjas will either disband or trudge to 
another post-indusuial wasteland, ped-
dling their distinctive brand of muscle-
bound pageantry to new adoring fans. 

To the uninformed, an looks more 
like rec hour at the outhouse than football. 
Grown 
men 
ram 
one another 
to 
smithereens while chasing an oblong ball 
around a half-sized, walled-and-padded, 
asu orurfed cage. There is no punting, and 
nets deflect the ball back into play after a 
field goal is missed. The best players-
including New Haven's famed Anthony 
Comer-are "sixty-minute men." 

With a $36 dollar seat and a $10 ticket, 
this is what I see: 

Despite the high scores and brutal col-
lisions, the highlights come when play 
scops. At one point, football apparel is 
lined up every five yards; two drunk, 
doughy men will suit up over their clothes 
and race for the goal line. Pete is slightly 
more coordinated. He oucdresses Adam 
and lumbers to victory. Defeated, Adam 
spots [Nun)Chuck the Ninja, the team 
mascot, on the sidelines. Adam pauses for a 
moment and then barrels shoulder-first 
into Chuck, sending him to the floor. But 
Chuck's the wrong ninja to russel with: He 
gracefully subdues the man while security 
rushes in and the crowd blows its top with 
admiration. 

Later in this same game, an angry 
player kicks the ball into the stands after 
ending the game with a futile touchdown. 
An elderly man leaps into the air. He catch-
es the ball but fumbles when he crashes 
three rows back, spilling spectators and 
beer. After a hush, someone gives him the 
ball, and he emerges with it held tri-
umphantly high. We clap respectfully. 

To rouse the crowd from its torpor, the 
Ninjas' cheerleaders, the Stan, execute sec-
ond-rate dance moves. On the sidelines 
they seem co evince the enthusiasm of un-

oiled automata, but during the halftime 
show they break out the lapdance moves. 

In the first quarter of every match there is 
an "Honorary Cheerleader": a gawky pre-
pubescent girl plucked from the crowd and 
placed in the middle of the Stan with pom-
poms thrust into her hands. As they swivel 
and gyrate she looks about helplessly; a few 
try to follow along with the crew, but most 
just stand and look on, confused and sad. 

In the first row, directly behind the 
opposing team's bench, sit the Chop-Chop 
Guys, New Haven's secret weapon. The 
Chop-Chop Guys are two men in their 
mid-twenties, one short and round with a 
black goatee, the other skinny and tall with 
dirty blonde hair. By the fourth quarter, 
they are usually either roaring drunk or 
ejected. They heckle the opposing team for 
all they are worth. The Chop-Chop Guys 
are also the originators of the Chop-Chop 
phenomenon: One spastically chops at the 
air kung-fu style and rapidly mutters 'chop 
chop chop chop' to encourage or applaud. 

But by the second-to-last game of the 
season, it's clear that the Ninjas have lost 
not only their last three games, but also the 
hearts of their dearest fans: The Chop-
Chop Guys have defected. They boo the 
Ninjas and cheer their opponents. They 
argue loudly and violently with the other 
fans. I walk up and ask them why. "They 
keep losing! And when these assholes [the 
other fans] around us started calling up and 
complaining about us, we lost it." One of 
them came to the game with NINJAS sucK 
written on the back of his shirt with tape. 
Told that 'suck' was not appropriate, he 
rearranges the design to have an x over NIN-
JAS. When the fourth quarter starts, he 
emerges from the bathroom with NINJAS 
SUCK COCK. They are escorted out of the 
Coliseum, taunting all the remaining 
Ninjas diehards with a limp and drooping 
foam sword. That is the last we see of the 
Chop-Chop Guys. 

And that's how, after showing some 
early promise, the Ninjas broke our hearts. 
It happened mid-season: On the cusp of 
·SOO, they were at Albany's one-yard line in 
overtime. Our quarterback backpedaled, 
got hammered, dropped the ball, and 
Watched as it was returned for a touch-
down. Fans showered the field with pop-
com. We knew that our horse was running 
With three good legs, that the gunshot was 


only a matter of time. Our boys ended up 
in second-to-last place in the American 
Northeast Division. 

So as you hear the faint crash of the 
Coliseum this fall, say a prayer for Anthony 
Comer, Chuck, Coach "Buff" Buffington, 
and the rest of the gallant Ninjas. Like a 
black light, they shone so dimly, and then 
died too fast.

TWO MILKY WHITE 
RECTANGULAR SIGNS 
with bold, black, 
capital 
letters-
"CAUTION: 
HIGH 
SPEED 
AREA" 
and 
"AUTHORIZED PER-
SONNEL 
ONLY"-
greeted me from the 
industrial landscape 
as I began my pil-
grimage. I was at 
New Haven's Union 
Station; Yale was 
behind 
me, 
ahead 
of me-
beyond the caution 
signs-were 
72.5 
miles 
of 
track 
stretching to New 
York's 
Grand 
Central Station. 

With a bag full 
of water bottles and 
energy bars on my 
back, I continued 
into the cold, damp 
dawn air and faced 
the 
Connecticut 
Railway Maintenance Facility of New 
Haven. Twelve conjoining tracks and a fleet 
of canary-yellow Metro-North security 
vehicles teamed up to intimidate me. I had 
taken the train into New York a dozen 
times before, but this time I was going to 
walk. 

There was ample space next to the 
tracks-about ten to fifteen feet on either 
side. I checked the metal for vibracions 
every now and then. After walking a few 
miles, the sun began to rise, and I saw my 
first train. As the cars rolled my way, I ran 
to the outer edge of the track and hid 
behind some shrubbery. I went undetected. 

On the trail from New Haven ro New 
York, there are three types of terrain: 
ground-level tracks flanked by fields, 
neighborhoods, and marshes; elevated 
tracks passing over streers and bodies of 
water; and sunken tracks with fifteen-foot 
slate walls on either side. Sunken tracks 
were my favorire. I enjoyed climbing up 
rhe walls, walking along the ledges, living 
on the edge. 

As I approached my first major body 
of water, my mom called me on my cell 
phone to check up on things. I thought 
crossing the bridge looked fun, bur as I got 
closer, I saw that there was only about a 
foot of space separating death by train and 
death by drowning. I climbed down to the 
water's edge. Half a dozen speedboats scur-
ried under the bridge. The closest one car-
ried a trio of sunburned, beer-bellied old-
timers. The boat sputtered toward me. As it 
approached, I could see that the men were 
pleasant enough, but I was still nervous. To 
my relief, they initiated conversation: "Hey 
buddy." I tried to respond casually. "I know 
this sounds really strange, but could you 
possibly take me across the water?" "Sure, 
five bucks." I hopped in, not a single word 
was spoken as we crossed. I was about to 
leave with a quick "thank you" when some-
thing caught my eye. Resting on top of one 
man's head was an oversized foamy white 
hat with blue netting in the back. Ironed 
onto the foam was a map of the United 
Stares and the words "Get Your Kicks On 
Route 66." I had to say something. "That 
hat's great. It reminds me of home." 

Awkward silence. "Could I possibly buy it 
off you?" "Are you kidding?" "No, I'll give 
you twenty bucks." "Deal." 

With my new cap in place, I reached 
an intricate over-
pass in Bridgeport 
that traversed yet 
another body of 
water. Standing by 
my plan to avoid 
traveling 
on 
bridges, I crossed 
beneath the uacks 
and climbed back 
up on the other 
side. In Fairfield, 
the buffer zone 
between track and 
fence became dan-
gerously narrow. I 
jumped the fence, 
off of the tracks 
and onto Carter 
Henry Drive. I 
bought a dipped 
cone at a Dairy 
Queen 
resumed my jour-
ney 
once 
tracks looked safe. 

A few miles down 
the line I counted 
a dozen security 
trucks in my path. Fearing detection, I 
once again climbed the fence and got off 
the tracks. When I began the trip, I want-
ed to be the kind of guy who would swim 
across shark-infested oceans, jump on the 
cabooses of speeding trains, and hold my 
ground against any middle-aged Metro-
North official. But I was pussyfooting, 
messing around, avoiding danger left and 
right. I was less rugged pilgrim and more 
Jewish mother. My cell rang for the second 
time. It was _my mom again. I love Jewish 
mothers. 

Midnight came quickly the first day. It 
was cold and I was standing on the ledge of 
a Scooby Doo billboard near Stamford. 
Freddie Prinze, Jr.'s mouth was the size of 
my head. Knowing I wouldn't sleep out-
side, I called a friend at his home on the 
Upper East Side. By one in the morning, I 
was asleep inside his 1984 blue Cadillac. I 
woke up the next morning at six rested and 
ready for more. 

Graffiti is ubiquitous on the Metro-
North train line--literally thousands of 
tags between New Haven and New York on 
buildings, train cars, fences, rocks, even 
dirt. A cage that encases a huge generator 
with 
a 
warning-"Caution: 
10,000 
volts"-
is beautifully decorated with color-
ful graffiti. Huge metal posts supporting 
webs of large electrical wires were clustered 
along the tracks. Each post had a white sign 
reading "Danger: Live Electrical Wires," 
and each sign was tagged with the same 
explorer's mark. A blackened rock read 
"Partied Hard: 10-19-98.'' T his was charted 
territory. 

I didn't meet anyone on my journey. 
Before setting out, I had fantasized about 
discovering "tunnel-people" along the way. 
I planned on blowing away sociologists and 
anthropologists with stories of entire com-
munities that secretly lived in darkness. I 
would find throngs of timeless charac-
ters-brave men recalling their days back 
in 'Nam, beautiful women sick of life above 
ground, investment bankers tired of JPo's 
embracing the R&R that only rock, track, 
and concrete provide. But to my dismay, 
the tunnels were empty. No homeless peo-
ple, no rail yard bulls, no one. 

When I neared Harlem on the evening 
of day two, I realized that yet another 
obstacle was in my way-namely, the 
Hudson River. I rationalized: "There really 
isn't anything that interesting between 
l25TH and Grand Central. And even if 
there were, the four mile long elevated 
track could prove deadly." I called my 
friend with the Cadillac. He picked me up, 
and we headed home. I had hiked the 
Metro-North with no close calls, no arrests, 
no glorious discoveries, and precious little 
of the adventure and self-discovery I had 
imagined. 72.5 miles of track behind me, 
and all I had was a new foam hat.

but on whose terms? 
THB NEW jouRNAL

I 
N THE EARLY HOURS OP SEJYfEMBF.R 19, 1999, five white men 
chased down and assaulted a Yale student of Asian descent oucside 
a Howe Street laundromat. The Yale Police Department classified 
the attack as a "violent crime with apparent racial undertones" but 
released few details of the case to the public. According to rumors, 
the assailants shouted the word "chink" before they stomped the 
victim's head into the ground, puncturing his eardrum. Some 
believed the attackers robe Yale football players. Within a matter of 
weeks, the Asian American Srudenrs Association (AASA) scheduled a 
silent vigil and a Dwight Hall town meeting on hare crime, and the 
group's political action chair, Lee Wang, wrote an impassioned, but 
largely unsuccessful, plea in the Yttl~ Daily Nnus for public discus-
sion of the case. 

But as student organizadons rallied against rhe assault, investi-
gators struggled to pur a case together. Several witnesses came for-
ward, bur the victim refused to press charges. W ithout his coopera-
tion, the police could do lictlc to determine who was responsible for 
the arrack or even whether it was racially motivated. "We've inves-
tigated it as far as we can go at this time," YPD Chief]ames Perrotti 
announced that November. "Right now we've been unable to deter-
mine definitively who committed the assaults." At the end of the 
year, the case remained unsolved. 

The mystery of the attack left the Yale community frustrated 
and confused. While minority groups were up in arms, many stu-
dents and administrators were not convinced that race played a 
decisive role in the assault. "As I remember rhe incident," Dean of 
Student Affairs Betty Trachtenberg cold me, "there was a major 
alcoholic component to it." For many, it was hard co imagine char 
serious racial violence could happen ar a place like Yale, especially 
in 1999. Just two years earlier, the Minority Recruitment Program 
had launched a spare of open houses, phone-a-thons, and fly-ours 
to increase minority recruitment for the class of 2002. And in the 
spring of 1999, only a few monrhs before the alleged racial attack, 
Yale had made two ocher substantial moves: President Richard 
levin and Provost Alison Richard launched an initiative ro increase 
faculty diversity, and the Pre-Registration Orientation Program 
(PROP), a week-long orientation program for students of color in 
the freshman class, was revamped and renamed "Cultural 
Connections." 

In the wake of a potentially explosive situation, Yale managed 
to escape with remarkably few scrapes and bruises. A visit this year 
to Cultural Connections shows how, while the program could not 
stop the assault from occurring, it may have played a vital role in 
making sure it ended without incident, and without redress.

NE MORNING IN AuGUST, one hundred members of the Yale 
class of 2.006 and I caught a bus to a pow-wow. The group--
here early for Cultural Connections-was headed for the 
Mashentucker Pequot Reservation in eastern Connecticut. We 
would be attending the annual Schemitzun celebration, a gathering 
of 500 Native American groups, to experience traditional dancing 
and singing firsr-hand. 

T he ostensible goal of Cultural Connections is two-fold: to 
help incoming minorities meet studentS and administrators of color 
whom they might otherwise have difficulty finding and to intro-
duce them ro Yale's academic and extra-curricular resources. What 
that means, in concrete terms, is a lor of social events, such as the 
trip we were taking, and a slew of panels, lectures, and discussions. 
As the director of the program, Dean Saveena Dhall, pur it to me, 
"We're just trying ro do things that are going to bring people of dif-
ferent communities together, introducing them to various academ-
ic resources, introducing them to the cultural centers." 

At the pow-wow I hopped off the bus and walked into a clus-
ter of tents with a group of cc participantS. Dean Dhall had biUed 
the event as something of a cultural experience--"dancing and 
singing"-bur ro my surprise, I found at first only peddling: rows 
and rows of stalls seUing handicrafts, trinkets, and food. Among the 
items for sale were "Indian medicine bags;" fox, coyote, and wolf 
skins; pottery; wampum jewelry; moccasins; car decals; expensive 
herbal shampoos; and co's by the rapper Litefoot. One stall fea-

But if the political role of Cultural 
Connections benefits the students, 
it benefits the administration as well. 
tured an array of gimmicky t-shirts. 
Emblazoned on them were messages like 
" NBA: Native by Ancestry," " FBI: Full 
Blooded Indian," "Native Honey," and, of 
course, "United We Stand: USA, Home of 
the Brave." Food vendors were selling deli-
cacies: fry bread; buffalo, elk, and caribou 
burgers; "gator bites"; and corn cakes. 

Cultural Connections was not always 
like this. This marked just the second year 
that the program went to Scheminun and 
just the fourth that it included a strong 
multicultural component. Originally, the 
program served as an intensive remedial 
workshop 
called 
the 
Puerto 
Rican 
Orientation Program (PROP). PROP existed 
mainly to ensure that the writing and math 
skills of Yale's incoming Puerto Rican stu-
dents marched chose of their more privi-
leged peers. Over the years, as Yale's student 
body diversified, PROP opened its doors to 
all minorities, and eventually changed its 
name to the "Pre-Registration Orientation 
Program." But by 1999, many felt that the 
program's remedial emphasis was outdated 
and inappropriate. "Students felt chat the 
acronym PROP had a rather negative con-
notation, that outside people felt that the 
kids who were coming to PROP needed to 
be 'propped up,"' Betty Trachtenberg told 
me. "It became in some people's eyes a 
pejorative concept." So Rick Chavolla, the 
director of PROP at the time, changed the 
name of the program to "Cultural 
Connections" and replaced remedial activi-
ties with events like the pow-wow, a poetry 
jam, and panels on cultural and racial 
issues at Yale. 

In the past several years, however, 
Cultural Connections has taken heat from 
critics who claim that the program rein-
forces racial divisions at Yale by separating 
12 
minonues from their white peers before 
school starts. Dean Dhall was quick to cell 
me that such talk has no validity, at one 
point even handing me a clipping from the 
undergraduate 
race 
magazine 
ITPE 
authored by two c c participants -
Jonathan Farmer, an African American, 
and Ameer Kim El-Mallawany, a half-
Korean, half-Egyptian-about how the 
two of them, against all odds, became best 
friends at the program. "Uon and I], we 
might've been acquaintances had it not 
been for that blessed program," it read. 
"We rnight've been. I mean I'm talking 
fraction-of-a-percent-style here ... Me and 
Jon are friends because in a perfect world, 
we would've been. And for a week, we were 
in a world that was perfect enough." 

It is precisely because of the new mul-
ciculrural 
philosophy, 
supporters of 
Cultural Connections say, that the program 
does not advocate separatism. Dhall points 
to the fact that Cultural Connections has 
coordinated a number of events with other 
preorientation programs in the last few 
years. This year, cc participants attended 
an ice cream social with members of the 
Freshman Outdoor Orientation Trip 
(FOOT) program, a barbecue on Old 
Campus with the football team, the 
Orientation for International Students 
(01s) program, the Freshman Counselors, 
and FOOT, and a "Game Night" party with 
OIS. "You really gee a feel for how co inter-
act with people unlike yourself at cc," for-
mer participant and aide Taiwo Stanback 
cold me. Despite the face that cc is partly 
about "stressing your identity," she said, 
"it's an opportunity co mix and mingle 
with people unlike yourself." Dean Dhall 
made a similar point: "You can't say that 
we're creating a single kind of student; 
we're actually facilitating a lor of interac-
tions within [the minority community]." 

N THE DECADES BEFORE PROP CAME INTO 
existence, minorities at Yale were few and 
far between. The number of non-whites 
per class never numbered more than a few 
dozen. When William Ashby, an African 
American student at the School of Religion 
in the early 20TH century, helped organize 
Yale's first black fraternity, Alpha Phi 
Alpha, there were only 16 black students at 
the whole university. By the 1960s, the 
numbers had only increased to about 15 per 
class. 

But in 1964, the situation began to 
change. That year, all 14 black freshmen 
joined together to form what would, two 
years later, be called the Black Student 
Alliance at Yale (BSAY). Initially, the group 
focused on social issues at Yale. "We got 
together because we felt a need co assert our 
sense of positive self-identification," orga-
nizer Armstead Robinson told the Yale 
Alumni Magazine in 1969. "Mixers were 
really bad; we tried to create a normal social 
situation for ourselves." But in 1967, the 
group turned its gaze to an even more 
pressing issue: the Yale curriculum. BSAY 
undertook an intensive study of the cur-
riculum and entered into intense negotia-
tions with President Kingman Brewster, 
Provost Charles Taylor, and Dean George 
May about the possibility of creating an 
African 
American 
Studies 
program. 
Surprisingly, the administration was open 
to the students' demands. As Caroline 
Jackson Smith, a Yale student in the early 
1970s and director of the African American 
Cultural Center in the 198os, described the 
situation co me, "Yale did a very unique 
thing... [President Brewster] said, 'Come

in and let's negotiate. If you can prove to 
me that these demands are reasonable, then 
we should work on them in a reasonable 
way."' 

Eight months after BSAY held a nation-
al symposium on African American 
Studies, the faculty of Yale College unani-
mously approved the creation of a major in 
African American Studies. It was the first 
black studies program at an elite university. 
Soon BSAY procured a Cultural Center, a 
dean of black students, and a minority 
~ruitment progtam. After the assassina-
tion of Martin Luther lGng, Jr. in 1968, 
African American admission numbers 
increased as well. "In our minds, it was very 
important that we not just have the experi-
ence that some of our parents had," 
Jackson Smith told me. "Their experiences 
wac, 'You're a single black person. You 
don't bring the black experience with you, 
you just try to fit in.' Our generation was 
like, 'We're coming in big numbers, and we 
don't just want to be here--we want to be 
here as ourselves.'" At that point, the flood-
pees opened for other minority groups. 
Within the next ten years, cultural centers 
and deans for Latinos and Asian Americans 
appeared. PROP was just one part of that 
development. 

What stood out most about the push 
for integration in the 1960s and 70s was 
the f.act that the process was almost entire-
ly non-violent. Unlike Cornell, where 
armed students occupied the student 
union, Yale sat down and negotiated calm-
ly. The result has been 30 years of relatively 
lteady and peaceful interaction between 
the administration and students on issues 
of race. But it has also meant that Yale's 
administration, through deans, cultural 
~nters, and programs like Cultural 
.. 
Connections, has had a high degree of 
influence over race organizations on cam-
pus. 

L
ADIES 
AND 
GENTLE-
MEN, welcoming you 
to their territory, here they 
are, 
the 
Mashantucket 
Pequot tribal people and 
the Eastern Pequot tribal 
nation! Let's give them a 
big round of applause as 
they welcome you to their 
territory for the annual 
Schemiiiiinun 
celebra-
tion!" The emcee's voice 
issued from a large tent. I 
walked inside toward a 
group of cc participants 
and watched as a line of 
Native Americans in tra-
ditional dress screamed 
into the tent to resounding 
drum beats. "Here come 
Iroquois 
smokedancers!" 
shouted 
the emcee. "Wave to the 
people, smokedancers! GIVE 
IT UUUUP! Iroquois style in 
the house!" Over the next 
hour or so, more than a 
thousand people represent-
ing tribal groups from across 
the United States, Canada, 
and 
Mexico-from 
Onondaga to the Aztecs-
filled up the tent. "The true heartbeat of 
our people! What a beautiful sight!" 

If Cultural Connections exists to make 
the transition to college easier for minority 
students, it also serves a purpose similar to 
that of the Schemiczun pow-wow: to create 
solidarity among disparate 
minority 
groups. In that way, Cultural Connections 
takes on a distinctly political role. As Alexis 
Hoage, an aide, put it, 
"With 
Cultural 
Connections, it's con-
necting the different 
minority groups, just 
because there are situa-
tions at Yale where stuff 
happens and there need 
to be coalitions for that. 
Ir sounds cheesy, but you 
make those initial little 
personal 
connections 
with incoming ~hmen 
and they're gonkt stick 
around three years later 
when you're trying to 
tackle MLK day." Taiwo 
Stanback agreed that Cultural 
Connections can 
be 
an 
important tool for effecting 
change. "Basically, Yale is a 
microcosm of the United 
States," she told me. "And 
until the United States 
changes, the [racial] prob-
lems are still going to be 
there. Cultural Connections 
is a way of dealing with 
those problems." 

The kinds of problems 
that Stanback and Hoage 
are referring to include 
incidents like the one in the Morse College 
dining hall last January. When junior 
David Ahn, a Korean American, suggested 
to the dining hall management team that 
they put on a Korean theme dinner, 
Manager Brian Frantz jokingly replied, 
"What would that be? Dog$•and kimchi?" 


**Title:  Yale's Cultural Connections (continued)**
**Page number(s): 14**

In a much-publicized letter to the Korean American Students of 
Yale (KASY), Ahn described his reaction to the comment as 
"shocked" and "offended." He later ftled a report to make sure that 
the incident would go on Frantz's record. As trivial as the event 
seemed to some, it proved an important catalyst for the formation 
of perhaps the first broad coalition of minority groups at Yale. In 
the spring, an emerging organization called the Pan-Ethnic 
Coalition presented a resolution on cultural sensitivity, drafted by 
the Asian American Student Association (AASA) and ratified by all 
the major cultural groups on campus, to Dean Trachtenberg. 
Among the resolution's requests were cultural sensitivity training 
workshops for incoming freshmen. "Tension and resentment dear-
ly exist when it comes to cultural differences and problems that arise 
from it," part of the resolution reads. "Incidents such as the remark 
by the Morse dining hall manager serve only to create a threatening 
atmosphere. They devalue the distinctive contributions of the indi-
viduals affected and impair their ability to contribute to the com-
munity. By alienating those individuals, they harm the whole Yale 
community." Dean Trachtenberg says that she plans to work with . 
the Pat-Ethnic Coalition in the coming months. 

if the political role of Cultural Connections benefits 
minority students, it obviously benefits the administration as well. 
The program represents a major opportunity for administrators-
specifically, the three cultural deans, who all make appearances at 
cc-to form close relationships with participants, aides, and even 
ethnic counselors who, down the road, will very likely play impor-
tant roles in campus activism. Of the dozen or so aides I met when 
I visited Cultural Connections, almost all were involved to some 
degree in activist groups, such as BSAY and AASA, or the cultural 
houses. When incidents such as the "dogs and kimchi" affair occur, 
the task of keeping the situation under control is that much easier 
for administrators, who already know many student activists, some-
times very personally. 

In the spring of 2001, this became all too clear. In the April 
Fools' Day issue of the Yak Daily N~s. Michael Horn, managing 
editor of the paper, wrote a piece entided "Confessions of a Jewish 
Asian Worshipper" that satirized a number of common stereotypes 
about Asian Americans. A few days after the story came out, AASA 
sent an email to members of the Asian American community about 
the incident. Dean Dhall herself tacked on a personal message urg-
ing student protest. "As members of the Yale Asian American com-
munity," she wrote, "I hope that you will feel the need to respond, 
either on a personal level or by participating in one of our commu-
nity efforts . . . I thank you for your support and for helping us con-
structively respond to folks at the YDN of why writing that promotes 
stereotypes is unacceptable, hurtful, and offensive to members of 
the Yale community." With this memo, Dean Dhall had a unique 
influence over bow students responded to a controversial racial 
issue, an influence she might nor have had without her ties to 
Cultural Connections. 

T 
HRRE YEARS AFTER THE BEATING of the Asian American Student, 
the case is still open, according to YPO Chief James Perrorci. But 
it seems unlikely that anyone will ever know for sure whether the 
incident was ~ vicious hate crime or just a late-night, drunken 
brawl. 

Did Cultural Connections's success somehow contribute to the 
mystery shrouding the case? On the one hand, the program repre-
sents thirty years of progress for minorities at an institution that was 
once a bastion of white, Anglo-Saxon Protestantism. Not only do 
African-Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and Native 
Americans now constitute a vital part of the Yale community, they 
also possess an intricate support system consisting of cultural hous-
es, cultural deans, ethnic counselors, and an orientation program. 
On the other hand, all of that progress has come at something of a 
cost: Yale's administration- for which a hate crime, or a divisive 
community response to one, would represent a public relations 
nightmare--now boasts firm institutional cies with most under-
graduate minority organizations on campus, in part controlling 
their responses to attacks like this. Cultural Connections, in partic-
ular, is an integral part of that process. 

On the fourth day of Cultural Connections, the program's par-
ticipants crowded into a lecture hall in the Slifka Cenrer for a panel 
on "Diversity, Cultural Centers, and Being a Person of Color at 
Yale." Panelists included Rosalinda Garcia, director of La Casa 
Cultural; Pamela George, director of the African American Cultural 
Center; and three minority undergraduates. The goal of the panel 
was, at least in part, to introduce the various people and resources 
that exist at Yale to provide for students of color. But as panel mod-
erator and Assistant Dean of Yale College Edgar Letriz reminded 
the crowd, "You need to know that we are not just the directors of 
the cultural centers. We're not hired to be specialists on multicul-
turalism .... We're in fact academic deans and student affairs deans 
of Yale College." He never acknowledged, however, that the dual 
role could create conflicts of interest. As long as Cultural 
Connections continues fostering early bonds between students and 
administrators, the Yale Community risks mistaking administrative 
damage control for administrative guidance.

Advertisemen c 
Yale University has been part of New Haven for three centuries and we are proud to be a part of our 
hometown's renaissance. In the past dozen years, Yale has committed $100 million to community 
outreach programs and community investments beyond the campus. The University provides 11 ,000 
jobs, with strong job security, good wages, and excellent benefits. Yale has supported the develop-
ment of 1 ,000 units of affordable rental housing and homeownership in New Haven neighborhoods 
and Yale helps grow the biotech industry that is bringing jobs and taxes to New Haven. Yale's com-
munity investment program supports 60 locally-owned stores in the vibrant Broadway, 
Chapel/College, and Whitney Avenue retail districts downtown, and the University is the largest real 
estate property taxpayer in New Haven. 
"Yale has been a good neighbor." 
Yale University takes a special inter-
est in supporting the education of 
New Haven's young people. More 
than 1 0,000 New Haven public school 
• students - such as those pictured 
here with Yale University President 
Richard Levin - participate in free 
educational programs sponsored by 
Yale on campus every year. 
Dr. Carlos Torre, quoted in the Yale Daily News, February 12, 2002 
"Yale University is there every day in countless ways 
to work with the whole community, creating jobs and 
bringing in resources that benefit us all."

R
N A CRJSP AFTERNOON in December, Dora Shaw sent her 15-
year-old son Derek to the store for groceries. Somewhere 
tween his house and the corner, two police officers stopped 
Derek, pinned his arms behind his back, cuffed his hands, and read 
him his rights. Derek, surprised and afraid, did not resist. The offi-
cers were holding a warrant with his name on it for armed robbery 
in the first degree. As he was escorted to a waiting patrol car, Derek 
asked if they could tell his mother why he would not be corning 
home. No, they replied, he could call her from the station. Derek 
climbed into the back seat of the patrol car and watched through 
the windshield as his neighborhood vanished from sight. 

For the past eight months, Derek has been held in two differ-
ent correctional facilities and appeared in three different courtS. He 
is currently incarcerated at the Manson Youth Institution in 
Cheshire, a level 4 high-security prison. He sees his family only at 
court appearances, where he sits across the courtroom with the 
other prisoners and wears a standard-issue orange jumpsuit, his 
ankles shackled and his hands cuffed behind his back. The state's 
evidence against Derek is an affidavit implicating him in the rob-
bery of a pizza deliveryman. The form is signed by a neighborhood 
boy with a lengthy criminal record. Derek has not been identified 
in a lineup and has no past juvenile record. He has never before 
been charged with a crime. In the eyes of the law, he is still inno-
cent. In fact, he could go home tomorrow-if his family could only 
post a $250,000 bond. 

LMOST EVERYONE ACCUSED OF COMMITTING A CRIM£ in New 
A Haven will stand inside Courtroom B, a lofty, dimly lit cham-
g
oo the first floor of the Geographical Area (GA) courthouse on 
Elm Street. Courtroom B was once majestic, with ornate moldings 
and other neo-classical flourishes. Now, decades of grime and tiny 
cracks mar its walls, and the gilt hands of the old-fashioned wall 
clock no longer keep time. But when the accused are led into the 
chamber, they are probably thinking only one thing: Will I go home 
today? 

At arraignment, the first court appearance following arrest, the 
defendant hears the charges against him and enters a plea of 
"guilty,'' "not guilty,'' or "no contest." If he pleads innocent, the 
judge sets a date for further proceedings and may impose whatever 
conditions he deems appropriate to ensure the defendant's appear-
ance in court and to "protect the safety of the community." These 
conditions can range from a simple "promise-to-appear" to the pay-
ment of bail money or property given co the court by the accused 
in exchange for temporary release. While sometimes as low as $500, 
bail often runs in the hundreds of thousands or, in some cases, mil-
lions of dollars. The court returns this amount if the defendant 
comes to court and retains it if he fails to show. Most defendants 
cannot afford to post their own bail. In such cases, the accused can 
pay a non-refundable fee to a bondsman, who will then assume 
responsibility for the entire bond. If the defendant cannot afford a 
bondsman, he stays in prison until his case finds its way through the 
judicial system-a process that can span weeks, months, or should 
the case go to trial, several years. 

Connecticut state law and the Eighth Amendment of the u.s. 
Constitution require that bail not be "excessive" -that is, it should 
not exceed the minimum amount necessary to ensure a defendant's 
appearance in court. There are, of course, exceptions. If the defen-
dant has a history of violent behavior, for example, higher bail can 
be justified. But the purpose of bail is to preserve the presumption 
of innocence by ensuring that a person is not unduly punished 
before being convicted. A defendant retains 
his freedom but still has an incentive co 
return to court. Bail is a contract between 
the state and the defendant: In exchange 
for a reasonable amount of collateral, the 
state agrees to honor the defendant's pre-
sumed innocence, and the defendant agrees 
to comply with the order of the court. But 
when bail crosses the murky line between 
reasonable and excessive, this presumption 
of innocence comes under threat. Bail then 
begins to seem less like a contract and more 
like an abuse of authority. 

ONTROVERSY ERUPTED LAST jANUARY 
C when a New Haven judge imposed a 
$50,000 cash bond-a sum that must be 
posted in full without the aid of a bonds-
man-on 19-year-old Brian Warner, a 
young man charged with shoplifting five 
times in less than a year, possibly co feed a 
drug habit. When Warner could not make 
bail, he returned to jail, where the follow-
ing morning officers found hlm dead on 
the floor with a bed sheer twisted around 
his neck. 

Warner's swcide rekindled a debate 
that had first begun ro years before. In 
1991, the Hartford Courant conducted an 
in-depth investigation of Connecticut's bail 
system. The paper examined over 150,000 
cases statewide for possible abuses and 
found that judges throughout the state reg-
ularly ignored the recommendations of bail 
commissioners, third party officers who 
suggest a bail amount based on an assess-
ment of a defendant's ties to the commuru-
ty, past criminal record, employment sta-
tus, the nature of the charge, financial 
resources, and potential risk to the public. 
The study also found that black and 
Hispanic defendants without a criminal 
record had to post on average twice that of 
white defendants to get out of jail. The 
srudy singled out New Haven as the lead-
ing culprit in setting ilisproponionately 
high bonds for minority defendants and 
perry drug-offenders. (The Connecticut 
Judicial Branch commissioned its own 
study of the issue in 1992. The enterprise 
was under funded and far less comprehen-
sive than the Courant study, and its con-
clusions were ultimately both less specific 
and less damning.) A decade later, little has 
changed in Connecticut's bail system, and 
bail amounts in New Haven are still rising. 

This year, more than to,ooo people 
will pass through the doors of New Haven's 
GA court. Fewer than 400 of them will ever 
see trial. The rest must be ilisposed of as 
quickly and efficiently as the resource-
strapped system will permit. For a judge, a 
disposition-the settlement of a case before 
trial-means one less case on an already 
overcrowded docker. With such a high vol-
ume of cases, many of which will end in 
convictions, the temptation co churn out 
fast justice can sometimes overshadow the 
rights implied by the presumption of inno-
cence. In many cases, a compelling police 
report can suggest almost certain guilt. 
Because a defendant who is locked up 
pleads guilty far more rearuly than one still 
on the street, high bail simultaneously 
moves backlogged cases and punishes those 
who appear guilty from the outset, making 
it an alluring solution and a dangerous 
shortcut. A two-time drug offender back in 
court on a new charge hardly strikes a sym-
pathetic chord with a harried judge who 
has seen hundreds just like him. But to 
punish a defendant with high bail based 
solely on the likelihood of guilt amounts to 
a subversion of due process. If he has com-
mined the alleged crime, those who serve 
the system must believe it will punish the 
guilty in due time. Unfortunately, time is 
exactly what the system does not have, and 
in the press to move cases, people can dis-
appear behind docket numbers.

I Jaquetta Robinson made the trip from

Jaquerca's apartment while she was our and 
found a stash of drugs she now claims 
belonged to her brothers and cousin. Three 
weeks later, an officer knocked on her door, 
again while she was out. Fearing the worse, 
she called a policeman she had known since 
childhood and learned that a warrant with 
a bond of s1oo,ooo had been issued for her 
arrest. "Ever since that day," she said, "I 
haven't been eating. I haven't been sleeping. 
I've been sick all this week. My stomach

sroo,ooo. By the end of the phone call, 
Jaquerta had resolved to encrust her chil-
dren ro relatives and cake her chances in 
court. "I don't wanna sign over my kids to 
nobody," she said, fighting back tears out-
side the Probate Court. "I don't wanna go 
SI!PTRMBER 2 0 02 
to jail. I don't wanna lose my apartment. 
But I know I don't have chat kind of 
money." 

The next morning Jaquctta was 
arraigned in New Haven court. After con-
sidering the charges-possession, posses-
sion with intent co sell, and violation of 
probation-the judge set bond at $175,000. 
Jaquetta would have ro pay a bondsman 7 
to 10 percent of chat, up to $17,500, co 
make bail. Following arraignment, Jaquctta 
returned co a prison cell, where she 
remained until her court dace on August 15. 
In many ways, Jaquetta's story typifies 
the kind of mass-produced justice that goes 
on in New Havcn's GA court. She stands 
accused of possession and violation of pro-
bation, cwo of the most common criminal 
offenses. She has only one previous convic-
tion and no history of violence. She con-
tinued ro attend probation after learning of 
the warrant for her arrest and then volun-
tarily turned herself in. She has strong fam-
ily ties and has been a long-time member of 
the community. All of this suggests chat she 
would be neither a serious flight risk nor a 
danger to the public. So why is Jaquetta 
Robinson in jail? 

In practice, when determining bail, 
judges have little time to consider the pre-
scribed factors, especially in overcrowded 
GA courts. The average arraignment cakes 
about five minutes, sometimes less. In chat 
time, the judge gets only a snapshot of each 
case--the defense's position, the prosecu-
tion's posicion, the police report, and the 
bail commtsstoner's recommendation. 
"Sitting in the GA is Like being a pan-time 
traffic cop, a part-rime psychologist and a 
part-rime social worker," says Judge Susan 
Handy, the Chief Administrative Judge of 
Connecticut's Criminal Division. "We just 
have to do the best we can on each case." 
Ultimately, the guidelines for judges co 
follow arc just that-guidelines. A judge 
has absolute discretion when determining 
bail. "Until challenged, a judge could justi-
fy almost any bond," says Judge Handy. 
"Certain judges will assess certain cases dif-
ferently. You can assemble a room full of 
judges and the range of bail for the same 
crime can vary from s5,000 co $250,000. 
It's their individual decision." Handy 
admits chat she rarely takes financial 
resources into consideration when deter-
mining bail, choosing instead to focus on 
the nature of the crime. Whether the 
defendant is a woman from the projects or 
an uptown heiress does not sway her deci-
sion, though another judge might consider 
wealth a crucial factor in deciding bail. 

Judges also emphasize chat in many 
cases bail isn't used to merely ensure the 
defendant's 
reappearance. 
And 
even 
defense attorneys agree that when a person 
has been charged with a particularly egre-
gious crime, public safety should take 
precedence over personal freedom. If some-
one commies the same crime multiple 
times, judges consider this pattern, even 
when the crime is nonviolent. This is often 
the case with drug-related offenses, like 
Jaquetta's, in which the recidivism race 
tends co be high. 

In letter at least, the system does offer 
recourse for defendants who believe their 
bail is too high. Following arraignment, the 
defense can file a motion to reduce bond 
and continue to petition the court until the 
bond is reduced or the case is dropped. "I 
chink certainly in my experience, [the 
defendant's] attorney will file a motion for 
bond modification if they believe their 
bond is unjust," says Judge Handy. ''After 
all, that's the only way we know if someone 
thinks a bond is unfair." 

But an appeal, a defendant's only 
recourse against unfair bail, can take 
time--time the accused spends in jail away 
from family, work, and other responsibili-
ties. "I don't care if the appellate court 
bends over backwards to expedite motions 
to review and get a quick hearing out," says 
Hugh Keefe, a New Haven defense attor-
ney. "And I think ordinarily they do "give 
them quicker attention than other things, 
but it nonetheless rakes time .... I don't 
care if it's as lirde as a week or two weeks, 
those are seven or fourteen days where you 
have a defendant incarcerated who in many 
cases shouldn't be incarcerated." 

Whether a defendant can make bail 
may also play a role in determining how 
long he spends in jail if convicted. "In some 
of these cases," says Keefe, "people will do 
more time because they can't make bail 
than they will do ultimately if and when 
they are convicted." A defendant out on 
bail has a much easier time assisting in his 
own defense. He is more accessible to his 
attorney and can help in the process of 
gathering evidence and in finding witness-
es to testifY on his behalf. Attorneys fr~m 
different racial and socio-economic back-
grounds than their clients sometimes find 
it difficult to locate witnesses in unfamiliar 
neighborhoods that are distrustful of out-
siders. In the case of Derek Shaw, it was 
months before the boy's attorney learned of 
a witness who could vouch for Derek's 
whereabouts at the time of the robbery, and 
still longer before he could locate the boy. 
"It makes it much more difficult to handle 
a case from the defense perspective if a 
client's incarcerated," says Torn Ullman, 
head public defender for the New Haven- · 
Meriden Judicial District. "Once a client's 
out, you can go to their home. You can go 
to the scene of the alleged incident. There 
are things you can do--you can find wit-
nesses more easily. There are many reasons 
that are advantageous for the defense to 
have someone out on bond." 

Public defenders, for their part, plead 
a lack of resources and an overWhelming 
caseload. Throughout the scare, the Office 
of the Public Defender handles the largest 
percentage of cases in the GA courts, some-
times as much as 63 percent in large urban 
centers like New Haven. Were public 
defenders to appeal every bond they 
thought unreasonable, the appellate court 
might be moved to question what some 
judges in New Haven consider reasonable 
bond. But then there are the clients to con-
sider. As Ullman admits, "The practical 
solution from the defense is never to cave 
in on those kinds of eases. But sometimes 
you'll have angry clients who are sitting in 
jail who demand to get out and have the 
right to plead or not depending on what 
the offer is. So it's hard to say, 'Look, on 
principle, sit in there for another three 
months while I fight this for you.'" 


**Title: "POOR PEOPLE SIT IN JAIL BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS TO MAKE BONDS. IT'S A COERCIVE SITUATION."**
**Page number(s): 21**

In a current, highly publicized case, 
Judge Joan Alexander imposed a bond of 
$2.5 million on John Paolella, a local 
bondsman charged with forging millions of 
dollars in phony bail bonds. At a bond 
hearing on July 19, Hugh Keefe, Paolella's 
lawyer, challenged the bond before 
Superior Courr Judge Holly Abery-
Wetstone, calling it "blatandy excessive" 
and an "abusive discretion" of the court's 
authoriry. "We have a man with no prior 
record," an outraged Keefe told the court. 
THE NEW JouRNAL 
"He is 28-years-old, has no history of vio-
lence. He has lived in this community his 
entire life." He made reference to cases in 
his long career as a defense attorney in 
which violent offenders were released on 
much lower bail, including a capital mur-
der case in New London where the defen-
dant was out on house arrest. When Keefe 
pressed Abery-Wetstone to justifY main-
taining the $2.5 million bond, she replied, 
"It makes sense when the defendant perpe-
trated a fraud on the Court, which is what 
happened this case." Keefe, stunned, 
informed the judge that she had just 
"reversed the presumption of innocence," 
essentially prejudging the case. There is no 
provision in Connecticut statute to justifY a 
higher bond for a fraud against the court as 
opposed to any other institution. Judge 
Abery-Wetstone eventually lowered the 
bond to $1 million, which Paolella's family 
managed to post with the aid of a bonds-
man. 

But not everyone can afford the 
bondsman's fee, and those who cannot are 
far more likely to put forth a guilty plea 
when the alternative is jail. "Poor people sit 
in jail because they don't have the funds to 
make bonds," says Ullman. "It's a coercive 
situation .... It puts people in the position 
where if their choice is to take a disposition 
that results in their freedom versus being 
locked up in jail another month, it's obvi-
ous what the choice is going to be." 


**Title: D.EREK SHAW HAS SPENT OVER 240 DAYS IN JAIL SINCE HIS ARREST AT THE END OF LAST YEAR.**

D 
ER.EK SHAW HAS SPENT OVER 240 DAYS 
in jail since his arrest at the end of last 
SEPTEMBER 2002 
year. After his latest appearance in court, 
another hasty and inconclusive proceeding, 
Derek's attorney spoke with Dora Shaw in 
a corner of the GA courthouse's cavernous 
central hall. Earlier that week, he had cold 
her he expected Derek to receive a bond 
reduction that would enable his family to 
pay a bondsman for his release. "If we can 
get him out of there, we'll take it all the 
way to trial if we have to," he had said con-
fidently at the time. But the reduction had 
failed to materialize, and he was consider-
ing other options. "I don't think we should 
fight this thing unless we can get him out," 
he explained to Derek's downcast mother. 
"All he wants is out of there and you want 
him home. I can talk to the prosecutor and 
see if she'll give us a good deal. He may 
only get a couple years. He might even get 
out before the case would have gone to 
trial." Suddenly, Derek's chance to prove 
his innocence and the state's chance to 
establish his guilt no longer mattered. If 
Derek pleaded guilty, his family would not 
have to worry about bail, the state would 
not have to build a case, and Derek, guilty 
or not, would go home. 
Derek Shaw and Dora Shaw 
are pseu®nyms.

T
HIS IS THE STORY OP SOMETHING INVISIBLE. A new power line 
linking the Connecticut and Long Island electrical grids now 
lies under the floor of New Haven Harbor. Depending on whom 
you ask, its placement there last May was either a godsend co a 
nation in the throes of an energy crisis or the nail in the coffin for 
a bountiful local ecosystem and an age-old local industry. This is 
because also resting beneath the water are beds of dams and oysters 
where from out of the muck a number New Haven area fishermen 
dredge up a living day after day. On May 17, 2002, a specialized rig 
that had sailed from the Netherlands tore a trench ten feet wide and 
20 feet deep through prime oyster habitat on the harbor floor 120 
feet below the surface, making way for a 24 mile cable that weighs 
3,700 tons. Though it may be invisible, the massive cable is hardly 
innocuous. Nor is it very effective: While the cross sound cable is 
ready to start sending energy from Connecticut to power 400,000 
Long Island homes, not a single amp has passed beneadt the ocean 
floor. 

Larry WUliams owns the rights to some of the shellflsh beds 
disrurbed by the cable. A fisherman since 1973, Williams is one of 
the few who carry out New Haven's &ding legacy as a booming port 
city. "I came from nothing," Wtlliams says about his life in the 
industry. ''I've made a study of it. I loved it. And I did well." 
WUliams tells the story of the cross sound cable as he works on 
his boat, cleaning the mast and sandpapering the hull. Bamboo 
sticks line the floor of the shell, surrounded by water-worn rope and 
bait-fllled buckets. "What happened here in New Haven is unlike 
anything I've ever seen before," he says. "I know there's a whole 
story yet to be told." This is largely because the history of the cable 
is as murky as its new resting place: It is a story of back-room poli-
tics and the struggle for power over power. 


HE DAY OP THE CABLE'S INSTALLATION, the Bush administration 
released its National Energy Plan. The document pointedly crit-
icized Connecticut, and more specifically, New Haven. 
Connecticut was labeled "parochial" for "rejecting efficient modes 
of energy transmission in the name of unsubstantiated local con-
cerns." Comparing the Northeast energy crisis to last year's 
California power allocation debacle, the national report pitched 
"energy restrueturing" as a solution, explaining that in order "to 
provide ample electricity at reasonable prices, states must open their 
retail electricity markets to competition." 

That was the exact case made last January when a private New 
England-based company proposed constrUcting a 33o-megawatt 
cable beneath the sound to the Connecticut Siring Council, a state 
THB NEW JouRNAL


Shoreham, a small town 60 miles east of Manhattan, lies
on Long Island's exclusive North Shore. Home to 3,000 resi-
dents, one school district, and three country dubs, Shoreham also
has one non-operational power plant on its waterfront. When it was
built in 1967, the facility was supposed to be Long Island's first and
only nuclear power plant. But when it neared completion in 1975,
15,000 local protesters gathered outside the complex and brought
the project to a halt. The plant, which cost $5·5 billion to build, sits
empty on a 419-acre site on the western bank of Wading River.

While New Haven tolerates four nuclear power plants in its imme-
diate vicinity, there is not a single nuclear power plant on all of
Long Island, despite rapid growth and scant resources to satisfy a
growing demand for energy. On the site of the Shoreham nuclear
plant, the cable comes ashore.

The Cross Sound Cable Company insists that the cable,
despite its local impact, serves a greater good. Their website claims
that "wherever good electric cies can link regions, the power com-
panies can aid each other, and energy is produced at the lowest pos-
sible cost. Since consumers directly feel the cost and reliability of
electricity, a project like the cross sound cable that strengthens the
pool also helps the consumer." While the cable has been promoted
for its potencial to facilitate a murual exchange of energy, in reality
power can only go in one direction at a cime: from cash-Strapped
New Haven to power-hungry Long Island. Cross Sound Cable
Company spokeswoman Rita Bowlby explains this matter of faccly:
"You either get it or you lose it." Connecticut Attorney General


4
00 OYSTER HARVESTERS WORK THE
NORTH shore of the sound, generating
s6o million annually for the regional econ-
omy, putting them first in the nation in
revenue and second in production. When
the proposal for the cross sound cable first
appeared in January, the Siting Council
probably had those statistics in mind. But
in a struggle that consisted primarily of one
company's word against another's, the task
of predicting the actual effects of the cable
proved difficult. An environmental assess-
ment by a third party had yet to take place,
and even protesters could offer only a vague
idea of the cable's concrete effects.

At the time of the first proposal, how-
ever, the Siting Council did know that
there were certain economic effects that
went beyond damage to the state's once
booming fishing industry. New Haven
Harbor is currently 35 feet deep. Other
major harbors of the eastern seaboard are
generally 15 to 20 feet deeper. Nearby New
York's, for example, is 55 feet deep.

Remaining competitive as a harbor will
inevitably require deepening, but the
cable's construction makes an expansion of
New Haven Harbor impossible.

The potential environmental implica-
tions and damage to New Haven's already
declining position as a port city make the
first unanimous rejection easy to under-
stand. The Siting Council ruled that the
cable's alleged benefits were not sufficient
to risk the pote-ncial repercussions. For a
while, it looked like the cable had been
defeated.

But by protecting its own interest,
Connecticut found itself in the national
spotlight. In the National Energy Plan
released in May, the Siring Council's
January decision is noted as a case in point
of why federal authority should be able to
override local concerns in the construction
of new electric transmission lines. By
rejecting the cable, the Siting Council fol-
lowed a law requiring that the benefits of a
proposed transmission facility go to the
individual state in which it is located,
rather than an entire region. With
President Bush's assertion offederal author-
ity comes the power of a national adminis-
tration to determine whether a transmis-
sion line can go through a state that has no
need for it-an interesting change of heart
for a dyed-in-the-wool states-rights conser-
vative. "We are now in an energy crisis,"
Bush said early in his presidency. "What
the people need to hear loud and dear is
that we're running out of energy in
America." Yet Rita Bowlby, spokeswoman
for the Cross Sound Cable Company, vehe-
mently denies that the cable is "the embod-
iment of a shifting national policy," as the
N~ Havm Regisur labeled it last summer.
"This project has nothing to do with the
national level," she says. "It is not a gov-
ernment project. It is a private project. It is
just a business deal." The apostles of ener-
gy deregulation make the same case: It is a
business deal, which allows competition in
the marketplace to lower prices and gener-
ate innovation. The one certainty is that it
is, if nothing else, a great deal for business:
The Cross Sound Cable Company stands
to make s8oo million.


OUTRACED BY THE SMOKE-AND-MIRRORS,
Connecticut Attorney General Richard
Blumenthal referred ro the Siting Council's
turnaround as "completely unjustified."
"None of the facts were different," he said,
"and the benefits to Connecticut con-
sumers in the reliability of electricity were
even less ... this was more of a political cal-
culation than a review of the merits."
Blumenthal credits the projeces realization
to a
power greater than his own.

"Fundamentally, the national administra-
tion has given great encouragement to 
cable operators," he alleged. "Both directly 
and indirectly, the federal agency should 
not be one sided at the expense of 
Northeast consumers." 


After the Siting Council's approval of 
the project in April, one step remained 
before construction could begin: securing 
permission from three fisheries based in 
New Haven Harbor co lay cable across 
their property. With a payment of $5 mil-
lion as an incentive--just over one half of 
one percent of the total s8oo million that 
Cross Sound Cable Company stood to 
profit 
from 
the 
deal-Briarpatch 
Enterprises, Tallmadge Brothers, and Fair 
Haven Clam and Lobster agreed to a settle-
ment, the terms of which have yet to be 
disclosed. 


In defense of the cross sound cable, 
Bowlby refers to a regulated cable that 
already exists beneath the sound between 
Norwalk, Connecticut and Northport, 
Long Island. While serving as a functional 
transmission line for the past five years, 
that cable also elicited the second largest 
criminal environmental penalty in history, 
second only to the Exxon Valdez oil spill. 


The Cross Sound Cable Company did not 
finish its project without its own share of 
violations. According to regulations set 
forth by the Department of Environmental 
Protection, the cable was to be laid 46 feet 
below the shoreline. After its construction, 
the Army Corps of Engineers discovered 
that the cable lies as shallow as three feet in 
seven areas. The cable is now idle as legisla-
tors debate whether or not to turn it on. In 
July, the Long Island Power Authority 
appealed to National Energy Secretary 
Spencer Abraham to allow the operation of 
the cable despite the violations. To 
Blumenthal's dismay, Abraham granted the 
request, authorizing the cable to operate in 
the evenr of a severe energy crisis. 


KENNETH WARNER IS AMONG THOSE 
whose future livelihood hangs in the 
balance. H is view on jurisdiction over the 
harbor is simple. "That's my channel," he 
tdls me. "That's my channel they're going 
through. And we've fought it from the 
beginning." A marine pilot responsible for 
steering ships safely inro their moorings in 
New Haven Harbor, he claims to know the 
unseen intricacies of the channel. The 
cable's current position, he says, hinders 
him from safely and effectively leading 
ships to port. "Anchoring is our last line of 
defense when we bring a ship in," he said. 
"If one of us drops an anchor, it will snag 
that cable." While the Cross Sound Cable 
Company offered the pilots compensation 
for any expenses they might incur, they do 
not assume liability should the cable get 
snagged, even where it is illegally buried 
three feet down. Unlike the company, how-
ever, Warner cannot afford co wait. "Their 
offer is all well and good, but I will have to 
anchor. And if nothing changes, I should 
probably declare bankruptcy, turn up my 
tent, and go away." 


When Warner claims ownership of the 
channel, he does so not for himself, but for 
the public. "That channel was dug with 
public funds," he states with calm insis-
tence. "Our tax dollars pay for that. Is some 
corporation really allowed to come in and 
put a cable on the bonom of a channel that 
will destroy the reason why that channel 
was there in the first place?" He's not the 
only one asking that question. Larry 
Williams is similarly troubled: "I know 
what happened was wrong." He continues, 
"I love my job. I love the water. And I 
thank the state for getting me where I am." 


But Williams assumes the responsibility of 
standing up for himself during a time when 
the interests of those in authority are sus-
pect. "If one of those fishermen had said no 
to their offer, just one, it would have been 
an entirely different story." His mouth 
twisting into a smile, he continues. ''I'm 
waiting for someone to come offer me mil-
lions of dollars to go through my land so I 
can say no. Then we'll see what happens. • ..

**Author: Christoph Heaney**
**Page number(s): 26-27**

IT IS RUSH HOUR IN GRAND CENTRAL STATION, and I wade 
through the early evening crowds of people in various states of 
dress and undress, careful not co brush my khakis and blue collared 
shirt up against anything dirty. Outside, taxis and speed-walking 
commuters dog 42ND Street. Then I turn right onto Park Avenue. · 
Quieter here, more dignified. It stands up ahead, on the right side 
of the street, a scone's throw from the Wescerri entrance to Grand 
Cemral. On the off chance I miss the 
huge blue flag emblazoned with a 
white "Y'' that flaps in the hoc city updrafts, 
a small brass plaque beside the tight revolving 
doors announces my destination: The Yale 
of New York. 


I button my sleeves 
through. 


Inside, I walk briskly past the pillars, couches, 
rugs that adorn the well-groomed lobby and 
elevator button. To my right, a taller guy, somewhat 
iar, glances in my direction before turning back to the 
vacor. He is better dressed chan I am. The elevator 
and the doors open. They're about to slide close when 
pops ... I don't know her name. Can't let on. 
"Hey Chris! How are you doing?" 
"Hey ... you! Good, thanks. So what 
you been up to this summer?" She puts on an earnest face and pre-
pares to answer but is interrupted by the doors swooshing back like 
brass curtains to reveal the Tap Room in all its cacophonous glory. 


The lighting in the Tap Room is low and intimate like a good 
Irish pub, leaving dark corners and quieter tables for conversation. 
The ceiling is a low, thick lattice of dark wood columns. Still, the 
room might seem spacious if its 4,000 square feet weren't filled with 
Yalies standing shoulder to shoulder. As it is now, the place reminds 
me of the old Naples on a Thursday nighr, packed with elbows and 
juggled pirchers of beer. But here, the patrons are infinitely better 
dressed. Ac Yale, we were just students. Now we have internships 
with the best fashion designers, most lucrative investment banking 
firms, and the trendiest magazines. On these summer Thursday 
nights, we pose as high paid bankers at Goldman Sachs living on 
the Upper East Side. We get a gritty street cred from tight t-shircs 
and faded jeans. We are hip and trendy fashionistas at vogue mag-
azine. We happily parley our internship experience into namedrop-
ping, networking, and conversational currency. 


The Tap Room atmosphere demands a standard pose: The 
guys, athletic looking, in blue button-down shirts, khakis with 
razor-sharp creases, and diamond-hard hair gel, stand casually with 
their shoulders back and hands in cheir pockets. They nod at each 
other to say hi, saving smiles for the girls. The girls hold their left 
elbows in their right hands, cradling liquors and tonics and wine 
coolers, and jut out their hips. They are even better dressed than the 
guys. They wear tight and fashionable skirts or classy slacks with 
black tops. Their hair is shoulder length, held back well or allowed 
to frame the face. 


I am about to step down from the raised carpet platform when 
a Club employee-stops me. He holds out his hand expectantly and 
I fumble with my IDs, finally giving him my Yale 10, proving that 
I'm both of age and of the University. I turn to the man sitting at a 
card cable to my left. He has a cash box in front of 
him and a little placard chat displays the drink 
prices and the evening's special: Corona for slightly less 
than standard New York prices. I buy a Corona drink tick-
et and a ricket for a "Yale Ale," swivel right and prepare to 
move into the crowd. 


slow going, as most people are in full cocktail mode, talk-
ing loudly and exchanging numbers for their silver flip-top 
cell phones. Most of them are calking about their intern-
ships. I pick up "J.P. Morg~n" and "portfolio" from a suited guy on 
my left. He's calking to a tall girl and a nodding fellow with his 10 
card still clipped co his belt. A friend from long before Yale scops 
me. Our conversations have sadly become robotic, but we still greet 
other enthusiastically. "So what are you up to this summer, 
man?" I ask, knowing perfectly well he told me a month ago. 


Unfortunately, I didn't care enough to remember. This con-
versation should be easy, since he's a talker. He cells me all about a 
play he's acting in, how the New York acting scene seems, and oh, 
did I see the little blurb in The Village voice? No, I did not. He goes 
on with observations about living the bohemian life in Brooklyn, 
sharing a house with a group of lesbians, one of whom has a son she 
takes care of {very poorly, in his opinion). He asks how I'm doing, 
and I tell him, feeding him the typical line about how rewarding .rp.y 
internship at The Village voice is, how ir's a great workplace, how I'm 
really glad I'm getting my New York experience. I sound like I'm 
lying, but I'm not. He lisrens better and is more sincere than any-
one else present, so I feel bad when I have to break off the conver-
sation to talk with people whom I care less about. 


I pick up conversation with a gaggle of stylish girls who I've 
met at some point in the past year. Half of them are from New 
York, saving on rene money by staying in their parents' apartments. 
They have scored great internships or assistantships with up-and-
coming designers or producers. A few are involved in governmen-
tal internships, but these girls play that achievement down, as it is 
less interesting than the gossip they heard about so-and-so yester-
day. 


One of them asks the evening's question: "So what are you up 
co this summer?" I tell her. "Really?" She's impressed "Oh, how did 
you gee that?" The conversation meanders on, and I ask what she's 
been doing, smile and nod in the right places, and I'm out of the 
conversation. 


The Tap Room is even more packed 
now, and I can't help but bump into people 
from whom I had wanted to take the summer 
off. They're good people, but all we'll talk 
about is how great their internships are and 
how wonderful my internship is, and then 
maybe make plans to go out next week, 
which we never will. But it's good practice 
for the networking skills we never knew we 
had. In the years since our entrance to Yale, 
our eyes and ears have become microscopes 
and satellites, picking up the slightest hint of 
acquaintances who might know someone 
who knows someone who knows someone. 


And before we can feel guilty about using our 
contacts as an advantage over the kids with-
out the snazzy Yale ring or well-developed 
network, we have a job, and it is water under 
the bridge. 


I spot a savior, a friend I actually talk to, 
just across the crowd, looking a little out of 
place. I'm feeling a little socially desperate, 
having just been snubbed by a recent Yale 
graduate that seems set on never leaving the 
college scene. He waxes and wanes between 
buddy-buddy and cooler-than-thou. Today 
it's the latter. I push my way past his chatter-
ing group and grab my friend's arm. He 
turns around, smiles, and then tells me wor-
riedly that someone was just looking for me. 


My friend and I lean our heads together and 
begin to complain about the atmosphere. I 
realize that with the exception of him and my 
old friend, I've only been talking to girls 
tonight. The place seems more loaded with 
testosterone than ever. The crowd of banking 
interns, all of whom are paid infinitely more 
than we are, are giving each other high 
fives--in a most dignified manner, of course. 


My friend and I begin to seriously talk 
about our internships, without the surface 
gloss and scripted lines, and we are quickly 
laughing. We talk longer about actual things. 
We make actual plans to go barhopping afrer-
wards and go our separate ways. I weave 
through the crowd looking for that girl I 
beard was working for a famous columnist. 
She'll be good to talk to.

The
~ '
book runs chronological-
ly from fetus-hood to Little League
with chapters interspersed recounting various parts of the author's
own childhood and parenting experience.
The best parts of the book are Schoenstein's well-researched
and astutely analyzed tales of the opportunities available to upper-
class parents in the United States. There is a "bull market in bull-
shit for babies," and Schoenstein addresses a whole battery of gim-
micks for what he calls "career moms," "fast-track dads," and
"resume-raising parents." At The Institute For The Achievement Of
Human Potential in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania, for example, kids
begin reading programs at the tender age of three months. Using
sound bytes from conversations with child psychologists and pedi-
atricians, Schoenstein provokes a few funny, though predictable,
exchanges with the employees of the Institute. Quoting some stud-
ies conducted by one child development specialist at Tufts
University, Schoenstein suggests to an Institute employee that chil-
dren learn to read better at a later age and that "the pressure for early
reading reflects the parents' need, nor the child's." The conversation
abruptly ends when the Institute employee disregards Schoenstein's
point: "Well, he [the specialist] better study some new children.
And you'd better visit us and forget about Tufts."
Schoenstein also spends time at a Bright Start Learning Center,
where parents are reminded in a
brochure that "when children
put blocks in trucks and dump
them out, they are learning to
understand size, weight, and
number concepts . . . When
children put on dress-up
clothes, they are learning
small muscle skills." High-
end day-care centers like
this one can cost parents as
much as $17,000 per year.
(Apparently,
the
extra
money goes toward the
sophisticated hermeneu-
tics of playtime.) After
watching two teachers
try to give mashed-pota-
to-chucking one-year-
olds a zoology quiz,
Schoenstein
suggests
that Bright Start has misinter-
preted the scholastic behavior of toddlers. "When chil-
dren throw mashed potatoes," Schoenstein glibly interrupts, "they
are learning to request boiled or fried." Amidst such barely tolera-
ble scabs at humor writing, Schoenstein does make the valid point
that sometimes children simply play and that to assign importance
and to measure potencial in every childish activity reflects a trou-
bling collective neurosis. This daycare center had turned blocks into
quizzes and snack time into lesson time, even reprimanding one
child for climbing the jungle gym off schedule. It seems to
Schoenstein that, unfortunately, "While trying to produce Mensa
mites, push-parents can't schedule that sweet time-waster called
play, for which there are no Cliffs Notes."
Among the gimmicks aimed at over-educated, over-ambitious,
over-zealous parents is Bloom's book, an anthology of stories and
poems supposedly for consumption by minors. Its title is character-
istically Bloomsian. He makes no apologies and does not skirt the
issue. This book is intended for parents who fancy their children to


--- Page 29 ---

be "Extremely lntelligenc."-dever mar-
keting to the intellectual masses. After all,
what Bloom fan wouldn't consider his own
children to be of the highest caliber? The
book is billed as Bloom's Cliffs Notes for
modern childhood but looks more like the
Cliffs Notes for his own. He claims to have
discovered, read, and reread every work in
the anthology during his own youth and
recommends that today's children "perse-
vere" and do the same. Bloom laments the
loss of a slow-paced, literature intensive
childhood in the introduction to his book:
I am old-fashioned and romantic
enough to believe that many chil-
dren, given the right circum-
stances, are natural readers until
this instinct is destroyed by the
media. The tyranny of the screen
threatens any order in which liter-
ary value or human wisdom can
be preferred to the steady flow of
information. It may be an illusion
to believe that the magical con-
nection of solitary children to the
best books can endure, but such a
relationship does go so long a way
back that it will not easily expire.
The selections in the book suggest a nostal-
gic Bloom dreaming of the young, patient,
Edwardian reader of yesteryear. The very
tide of the book, however, capitalizes on
every Schoenstein parent's need for instant
gratification.
The 500-page collection of pre-wwr
poems and tales, by the likes of Kipling,
Shakespeare, Dickens, Blake, Emerson,
and Whitman, is a rich compilation of lit-
erature and a far cry from the interactive
"Jump-Start Reading" co-ROMS discussed
in Schoenstein's book. The anthology
arranges the selections thematically by sea-
son. Opening with Keats's "The Human
Seasons," the first section of the book,
Spring, is fuJI of love, longing, and loneli-
ness. Summer is rich with humor, color,
and energy, inclu~g classics like Carroll's
"Humpty Dumpty" and Kipling's "Rikki-
T'akki-Tavi," as well as more obscure,
though equally pleasurable, stories like
S£i>'r£MBER 2002
"Uncle David's Nonsensical Story About
Giants and Fairies" by Catherine Sinclair.
Not much of it is accessible to children,
though. The book is like an undergraduate
English degree on the wall of a doctor's
office: impressive but of no practical value.
Bloom anticipates this criticism by
distancing himself from modern notions of
"Children's Literature." According to
Bloom, the very idea of Children's
Literature "had some use and distinction a
century ago, but now all too often is a mask
for the dumbing-down that is destroying
our literary culture. Most of what is now
commercially offered as children's literature
would be inadequate fare for any reader of
any age at any time." H e urges the "authen-
tic reader" of this book to take on the col-
lection as an opportunity to discover his
own potential as well as the potential of ini-
tially obscure or difficult pieces to open up
and enterrain.
The MTV generation, the information
age, the video game society: These tropes
have been used ad nauseum, but like most
cliches, there is some truth to them. Left to
their own volition, most children today
will turn on the TV or the computer; left to
their parents', they are more likely to fall
victim to one of the mothers parodied in
Schoenstein's
book-shuttled
from
Chinese tutoring to bassoon lessons to
gymnastics practice. Schoenstein self-
indulgently devotes a whole chapter to an
all-American neighborhood stickball game
starring himself as the new kid in town.
The chapter is a hardly bearable play-by-
play of a heroic outfield catch, but at the
root of his reminiscence lies a sad truth:
Children today no longer seem to play.
Schoenstein writes, "A kid today, who has a
curriculum instead of a childhood, who has
never known the heady feeling of actually
making his own plans, still often says, 'I'm
bored."'
.
For the few children who actually read
the bulk of Bloom's anthology, a wealth of
great literarure lies within. It may be true,
as Bloom claims, that for children to find
their way to Shakespeare, Chekhov, and
Austen, they must start with Kipling,
Stevenson, and Carroll, but Bloom's Ivy
Tower reality does not recognize that that is
no longer where kids want to end up. If the
ultimate
objectives
of Bloom
and
Schoenstein are to resuscitate a lost age of
childhood whimsy, whether it be stickball
or Arthur Conan Doyle, both offer a vision
that is tragically narrow and sentimentally
personalized.
While both authors take the opportu-
nity to romanticize childhood of yesteryear,
neither has any sense of contemporary
American childhood. The books are aimed
at neurotic parents full of high hopes for
their kids. Even the average yuppie, howev-
er, will be alienated by the selections in
Bloom's book and the Hunter, Dalton,
Greenwich inside jokes that are dropped
throughout Schoenstein's. As Schoenstein
ridicules the ambitious, Ivy-~nclined par-
ents of today, it becomes painfully obvious
that he runs in the same circle. Though the
book often aspires to real social criticism,
Schoenstein is more interested in gabbing
about his daughter's Little League team, his
own days at Stuyvesant High School in
New York, and his grandson's knack for
geography. He passes up chances for serious
commentary, making trite and esoteric
jokes instead. His ideal reader is one of the
very parents he is criticizing: someone who
will be in on the jokes and uncomfortable
with any real criticism. Bloom's book,
meanwhile, claims to encourage explorato-
ry reading habits of days long forgotten.
This stated purpose, however, is belied by
the book's selling point: Srori~s and Tales for
Extremely Intelligent Children is a quick-fix
book for children and parents who don't
have rime to explore. Both books, ulti-
mately, are little more than household
decor. Schoenstein's should sit stacked with
his other books on top of a toilet as occa-
sionally amusing bathroom reading while
Bloom's should grace the color-coordinated
Ethan Allen bookshelf above some
Westchester baby's crib.

**Title: The Things They Left Behind**
**Author: Matthew Underwood**
**Page number(s): 30**

The Things They Left Behind
HE THINGS THEY LEFT BEHIND WERE
T largely disgusting, a year's worth of
accumulated refuse: dust bunnies the size
of dinosaur eggs, emptied tins of potted
meat, q-cips clean and soiled, and, in one
room, enough body hair co have been shed
by a Yeti. Some of the trash made for a
laugh-a Bud Light sombrero, a faux-ciga-
rette hash pipe-but most left me cursing
Homo sapiens yalmsis, obviously the filthi-
est subspecies of humankind.
Yet scraps found here and there in the
junk heap told personal stories. As. you
move in, remember that when you 'move
out, you don't do so anonymously. Some
fellow students stick around at year's end
working Custodial. We know who you are
when we see what you leave, and we have
co start drinking at lunch just to cope.
Like most of us, much of our trash is
either dorky or dirty.
There were dart
guns, toy dinosaurs (I took those), rubber
snakes. In one desk drawer, a pen with
pink ink, a Backstreet Boys album, bub-
blegum, and nothing more.
Under one
couch, a cache of dildos. T here was anime
porn (a friend took it before I could); half-
empty cans of stale beer; and in a category
halfway between childish and adult, an
illicit handle of Smirnoff, rolled up in a
rug.
T hen there are the things that
only we can afford to throw away.
These include stereos and televi-
sions, refrigerators, canvas camp
chairs, torchiere lamps, futon
frames, a discman, leather jackets,
30
They Left
printers, dress shoes on their shoe trees, and
a hip Japanese rain jacket that folds up to
become its own bag. Most of it is hoarded
by student clean-up. crews, mad with find-
ers-keepers frenzy. What can't be reused or
resold on the September black market is
tossed into ubiquitous blue dumpsters,
where it is inevitably picked over again.
One day I swept up thirteen dollars in
coins before ten AM, only to have a co-
worker boast that he'd once found s185 in
change in a single jar. Old course books
were as good as cash at the bookstore's buy-
back counter.
At times, the litter or lack of it com-
posed biographical vignettes that made for
stark comparisons. On the windowsill of
one room littered with designer clothes and
pricey personal electronics sat a plastic cup
from Lehman Brothers brimming with golf
tees, perhaps an extra signing bonus for
some new banker. The next room over was
swept absolutely bare, nothing left behind.
But no narrative was as encapsulating
as the one contained in a forgotten card-
board box I cleared from an ov~rcrowded
Beh n d
by Matthew Underwood
storage room, its owner long since graduat-
ed.
Among the tighry-whities, plastic
bookends, pillowcases, and Dave Matthews
cos was the turbulent story of a Yalie in
love. There were prom pictures in a white
cardboard frame, then farther down, snap-
shoes of a different girl, smiling and pretti-
er chan the first. Among the old toothpaste
and crusted deodorant sticks, a packet of
birch control pills. Next co a book by John
Gaddis, a copy of 1001 Sex Secrets Every
Man Should Know Written by WOmen Who
Already Know. Inside, proceeding method-
ically up to Secret #218, a rigorous system
of checks and xs rated each of the suggest-
ed techniques. It remains unclear whether
she wrote the annotations before she gave
him the book or he compiled them as a col-
lection
of
pose-coital
notes-to-self.
Regardless, someone enjoys chan1pagne in
bed, slow dancing in the nude, a show of
vulnerability from her man, gentle use of
the tongue, hair stroking, sensitivity, and
sex where both parrners are "careful."
Deemed unacceptable are blindfolds, kinky
motels, private polaroids, oral sex, peanut
butter, lemon meringue anywhere outside
of a pie, candle wax, sex coys, homemade
pornos, bare-bottom spanking, and feath-
ers. And last, at me bottom of the box, an
emblem of me worst sort of loneliness:
shoved inside a sock and wrapped up in a
button-down shire, a home testing kit for
HIV-a relic of the lowest point, mat day
spent trying to smile while thinking alone
over and over: Oh please God no, nor me,
not now, not this.
