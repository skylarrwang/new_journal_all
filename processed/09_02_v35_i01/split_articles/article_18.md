"Fundamentally, the national administra-
tion has given great encouragement to 
cable operators," he alleged. "Both directly 
and indirectly, the federal agency should 
not be one sided at the expense of 
Northeast consumers." 


After the Siting Council's approval of 
the project in April, one step remained 
before construction could begin: securing 
permission from three fisheries based in 
New Haven Harbor co lay cable across 
their property. With a payment of $5 mil-
lion as an incentive--just over one half of 
one percent of the total s8oo million that 
Cross Sound Cable Company stood to 
profit 
from 
the 
deal-Briarpatch 
Enterprises, Tallmadge Brothers, and Fair 
Haven Clam and Lobster agreed to a settle-
ment, the terms of which have yet to be 
disclosed. 


In defense of the cross sound cable, 
Bowlby refers to a regulated cable that 
already exists beneath the sound between 
Norwalk, Connecticut and Northport, 
Long Island. While serving as a functional 
transmission line for the past five years, 
that cable also elicited the second largest 
criminal environmental penalty in history, 
second only to the Exxon Valdez oil spill. 


The Cross Sound Cable Company did not 
finish its project without its own share of 
violations. According to regulations set 
forth by the Department of Environmental 
Protection, the cable was to be laid 46 feet 
below the shoreline. After its construction, 
the Army Corps of Engineers discovered 
that the cable lies as shallow as three feet in 
seven areas. The cable is now idle as legisla-
tors debate whether or not to turn it on. In 
July, the Long Island Power Authority 
appealed to National Energy Secretary 
Spencer Abraham to allow the operation of 
the cable despite the violations. To 
Blumenthal's dismay, Abraham granted the 
request, authorizing the cable to operate in 
the evenr of a severe energy crisis. 


KENNETH WARNER IS AMONG THOSE 
whose future livelihood hangs in the 
balance. H is view on jurisdiction over the 
harbor is simple. "That's my channel," he 
tdls me. "That's my channel they're going 
through. And we've fought it from the 
beginning." A marine pilot responsible for 
steering ships safely inro their moorings in 
New Haven Harbor, he claims to know the 
unseen intricacies of the channel. The 
cable's current position, he says, hinders 
him from safely and effectively leading 
ships to port. "Anchoring is our last line of 
defense when we bring a ship in," he said. 
"If one of us drops an anchor, it will snag 
that cable." While the Cross Sound Cable 
Company offered the pilots compensation 
for any expenses they might incur, they do 
not assume liability should the cable get 
snagged, even where it is illegally buried 
three feet down. Unlike the company, how-
ever, Warner cannot afford co wait. "Their 
offer is all well and good, but I will have to 
anchor. And if nothing changes, I should 
probably declare bankruptcy, turn up my 
tent, and go away." 


When Warner claims ownership of the 
channel, he does so not for himself, but for 
the public. "That channel was dug with 
public funds," he states with calm insis-
tence. "Our tax dollars pay for that. Is some 
corporation really allowed to come in and 
put a cable on the bonom of a channel that 
will destroy the reason why that channel 
was there in the first place?" He's not the 
only one asking that question. Larry 
Williams is similarly troubled: "I know 
what happened was wrong." He continues, 
"I love my job. I love the water. And I 
thank the state for getting me where I am." 


But Williams assumes the responsibility of 
standing up for himself during a time when 
the interests of those in authority are sus-
pect. "If one of those fishermen had said no 
to their offer, just one, it would have been 
an entirely different story." His mouth 
twisting into a smile, he continues. ''I'm 
waiting for someone to come offer me mil-
lions of dollars to go through my land so I 
can say no. Then we'll see what happens. â€¢ ..
