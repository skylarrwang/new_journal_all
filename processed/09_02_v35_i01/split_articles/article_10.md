oiled automata, but during the halftime 
show they break out the lapdance moves. 

In the first quarter of every match there is 
an "Honorary Cheerleader": a gawky pre-
pubescent girl plucked from the crowd and 
placed in the middle of the Stan with pom-
poms thrust into her hands. As they swivel 
and gyrate she looks about helplessly; a few 
try to follow along with the crew, but most 
just stand and look on, confused and sad. 

In the first row, directly behind the 
opposing team's bench, sit the Chop-Chop 
Guys, New Haven's secret weapon. The 
Chop-Chop Guys are two men in their 
mid-twenties, one short and round with a 
black goatee, the other skinny and tall with 
dirty blonde hair. By the fourth quarter, 
they are usually either roaring drunk or 
ejected. They heckle the opposing team for 
all they are worth. The Chop-Chop Guys 
are also the originators of the Chop-Chop 
phenomenon: One spastically chops at the 
air kung-fu style and rapidly mutters 'chop 
chop chop chop' to encourage or applaud. 

But by the second-to-last game of the 
season, it's clear that the Ninjas have lost 
not only their last three games, but also the 
hearts of their dearest fans: The Chop-
Chop Guys have defected. They boo the 
Ninjas and cheer their opponents. They 
argue loudly and violently with the other 
fans. I walk up and ask them why. "They 
keep losing! And when these assholes [the 
other fans] around us started calling up and 
complaining about us, we lost it." One of 
them came to the game with NINJAS sucK 
written on the back of his shirt with tape. 
Told that 'suck' was not appropriate, he 
rearranges the design to have an x over NIN-
JAS. When the fourth quarter starts, he 
emerges from the bathroom with NINJAS 
SUCK COCK. They are escorted out of the 
Coliseum, taunting all the remaining 
Ninjas diehards with a limp and drooping 
foam sword. That is the last we see of the 
Chop-Chop Guys. 

And that's how, after showing some 
early promise, the Ninjas broke our hearts. 
It happened mid-season: On the cusp of 
Â·SOO, they were at Albany's one-yard line in 
overtime. Our quarterback backpedaled, 
got hammered, dropped the ball, and 
Watched as it was returned for a touch-
down. Fans showered the field with pop-
com. We knew that our horse was running 
With three good legs, that the gunshot was 


only a matter of time. Our boys ended up 
in second-to-last place in the American 
Northeast Division. 

So as you hear the faint crash of the 
Coliseum this fall, say a prayer for Anthony 
Comer, Chuck, Coach "Buff" Buffington, 
and the rest of the gallant Ninjas. Like a 
black light, they shone so dimly, and then 
died too fast.
