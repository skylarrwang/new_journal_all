EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
On September 12, 2001, we were told that everything was suddenly simpler. 
Battle lines were clearly drawn. Moral questions were obvious. This clarity heralded a "sea-change" from the troubling ambiguity of the decadent age that had 
ended the previous morning. We had emerged from a "haze of relativisim," and 
stepped into a new world painted boldly in black and white. 

In the flood of prophesy and pronouncement, the self-appointed arbiters of public 
opinion and the public ethos offered up Yale and its students as prime evidence of 
the awakening. David Brooks, pundit and "public intellectual," came to Yale looking 
for bright-eyed visionaries and, to no one's surprise, discovered exactly that. 

Before, we were lost, unprepared by environment and education to make firm decisions or "construct moral arguments." Those days of last fall signaled better times 
to come, with simpler thoughts and clearer morals-as Brooks put it, a new wave 
of "judgementalism." 

Brooks was by no means alone in this declaration. Alison Hornstein, then a Yale 
senior, echoed him in the pages of Newsweek. She pointed to "a deficiency in [our] 
generation's ability to make moral judgements," and cast the blame for our collective confusion on academics who had left us woefully unprepared to confront reality. She was no doubt thinking of people like Paul Kennedy. In those strange days, 
Kennedy, by no means a foaming-at-the-mouth radical, became a scarred nation's 
whipping boy for having dared to wonder out loud what the world might have looked 
like through the eyes of those 19 young men. In the process of lambasting Kennedy, 
a Wall Street Journal editorial dubbed Yale students "the best and the brightest" and 
portentously declared that we had found our calling and a clear sense of mission. 

They quoted the editors of the Yale Daily News: "After September 11, 2001, we 
came of age as a generation. We agreed on an agenda." 

What they told us on September 12 was wrong. A year later, our easy consensus, 
moral certitude, and clarity of purpose are gone. Every avowal of simplicity exposes 
a new layer of complexity. Every stab at certainty reveals another question.
