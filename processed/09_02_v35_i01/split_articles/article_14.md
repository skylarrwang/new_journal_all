New Haven and 
Yale University: 
Building Our 
Future Together 
Advertisemen c 
Yale University has been part of New Haven for three centuries and we are proud to be a part of our 
hometown's renaissance. In the past dozen years, Yale has committed $100 million to community 
outreach programs and community investments beyond the campus. The University provides 11 ,000 
jobs, with strong job security, good wages, and excellent benefits. Yale has supported the develop-
ment of 1 ,000 units of affordable rental housing and homeownership in New Haven neighborhoods 
and Yale helps grow the biotech industry that is bringing jobs and taxes to New Haven. Yale's com-
munity investment program supports 60 locally-owned stores in the vibrant Broadway, 
Chapel/College, and Whitney Avenue retail districts downtown, and the University is the largest real 
estate property taxpayer in New Haven. 
"Yale has been a good neighbor." 
Yale University takes a special inter-
est in supporting the education of 
New Haven's young people. More 
than 1 0,000 New Haven public school 
â€¢ students - such as those pictured 
here with Yale University President 
Richard Levin - participate in free 
educational programs sponsored by 
Yale on campus every year. 
Dr. Carlos Torre, quoted in the Yale Daily News, February 12, 2002 
"Yale University is there every day in countless ways 
to work with the whole community, creating jobs and 
bringing in resources that benefit us all." 
Evelyn Schatz, President of Chapel West District, March 12, 2002 
"Yale has assisted this community in ways too numerous to list."
