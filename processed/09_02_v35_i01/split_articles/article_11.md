TWO MILKY WHITE 
RECTANGULAR SIGNS 
with bold, black, 
capital 
letters-
"CAUTION: 
HIGH 
SPEED 
AREA" 
and 
"AUTHORIZED PER-
SONNEL 
ONLY"-
greeted me from the 
industrial landscape 
as I began my pil-
grimage. I was at 
New Haven's Union 
Station; Yale was 
behind 
me, 
ahead 
of me-
beyond the caution 
signs-were 
72.5 
miles 
of 
track 
stretching to New 
York's 
Grand 
Central Station. 

With a bag full 
of water bottles and 
energy bars on my 
back, I continued 
into the cold, damp 
dawn air and faced 
the 
Connecticut 
Railway Maintenance Facility of New 
Haven. Twelve conjoining tracks and a fleet 
of canary-yellow Metro-North security 
vehicles teamed up to intimidate me. I had 
taken the train into New York a dozen 
times before, but this time I was going to 
walk. 

There was ample space next to the 
tracks-about ten to fifteen feet on either 
side. I checked the metal for vibracions 
every now and then. After walking a few 
miles, the sun began to rise, and I saw my 
first train. As the cars rolled my way, I ran 
to the outer edge of the track and hid 
behind some shrubbery. I went undetected. 

On the trail from New Haven ro New 
York, there are three types of terrain: 
ground-level tracks flanked by fields, 
neighborhoods, and marshes; elevated 
tracks passing over streers and bodies of 
water; and sunken tracks with fifteen-foot 
slate walls on either side. Sunken tracks 
were my favorire. I enjoyed climbing up 
rhe walls, walking along the ledges, living 
on the edge. 

As I approached my first major body 
of water, my mom called me on my cell 
phone to check up on things. I thought 
crossing the bridge looked fun, bur as I got 
closer, I saw that there was only about a 
foot of space separating death by train and 
death by drowning. I climbed down to the 
water's edge. Half a dozen speedboats scur-
ried under the bridge. The closest one car-
ried a trio of sunburned, beer-bellied old-
timers. The boat sputtered toward me. As it 
approached, I could see that the men were 
pleasant enough, but I was still nervous. To 
my relief, they initiated conversation: "Hey 
buddy." I tried to respond casually. "I know 
this sounds really strange, but could you 
possibly take me across the water?" "Sure, 
five bucks." I hopped in, not a single word 
was spoken as we crossed. I was about to 
leave with a quick "thank you" when some-
thing caught my eye. Resting on top of one 
man's head was an oversized foamy white 
hat with blue netting in the back. Ironed 
onto the foam was a map of the United 
Stares and the words "Get Your Kicks On 
Route 66." I had to say something. "That 
hat's great. It reminds me of home." 

Awkward silence. "Could I possibly buy it 
off you?" "Are you kidding?" "No, I'll give 
you twenty bucks." "Deal." 

With my new cap in place, I reached 
an intricate over-
pass in Bridgeport 
that traversed yet 
another body of 
water. Standing by 
my plan to avoid 
traveling 
on 
bridges, I crossed 
beneath the uacks 
and climbed back 
up on the other 
side. In Fairfield, 
the buffer zone 
between track and 
fence became dan-
gerously narrow. I 
jumped the fence, 
off of the tracks 
and onto Carter 
Henry Drive. I 
bought a dipped 
cone at a Dairy 
Queen 
resumed my jour-
ney 
once 
tracks looked safe. 

A few miles down 
the line I counted 
a dozen security 
trucks in my path. Fearing detection, I 
once again climbed the fence and got off 
the tracks. When I began the trip, I want-
ed to be the kind of guy who would swim 
across shark-infested oceans, jump on the 
cabooses of speeding trains, and hold my 
ground against any middle-aged Metro-
North official. But I was pussyfooting, 
messing around, avoiding danger left and 
right. I was less rugged pilgrim and more 
Jewish mother. My cell rang for the second 
time. It was _my mom again. I love Jewish 
mothers. 

Midnight came quickly the first day. It 
was cold and I was standing on the ledge of 
a Scooby Doo billboard near Stamford. 
Freddie Prinze, Jr.'s mouth was the size of 
my head. Knowing I wouldn't sleep out-
side, I called a friend at his home on the 
Upper East Side. By one in the morning, I 
was asleep inside his 1984 blue Cadillac. I 
woke up the next morning at six rested and 
ready for more. 

Graffiti is ubiquitous on the Metro-
North train line--literally thousands of 
tags between New Haven and New York on 
buildings, train cars, fences, rocks, even 
dirt. A cage that encases a huge generator 
with 
a 
warning-"Caution: 
10,000 
volts"-
is beautifully decorated with color-
ful graffiti. Huge metal posts supporting 
webs of large electrical wires were clustered 
along the tracks. Each post had a white sign 
reading "Danger: Live Electrical Wires," 
and each sign was tagged with the same 
explorer's mark. A blackened rock read 
"Partied Hard: 10-19-98.'' T his was charted 
territory. 

I didn't meet anyone on my journey. 
Before setting out, I had fantasized about 
discovering "tunnel-people" along the way. 
I planned on blowing away sociologists and 
anthropologists with stories of entire com-
munities that secretly lived in darkness. I 
would find throngs of timeless charac-
ters-brave men recalling their days back 
in 'Nam, beautiful women sick of life above 
ground, investment bankers tired of JPo's 
embracing the R&R that only rock, track, 
and concrete provide. But to my dismay, 
the tunnels were empty. No homeless peo-
ple, no rail yard bulls, no one. 

When I neared Harlem on the evening 
of day two, I realized that yet another 
obstacle was in my way-namely, the 
Hudson River. I rationalized: "There really 
isn't anything that interesting between 
l25TH and Grand Central. And even if 
there were, the four mile long elevated 
track could prove deadly." I called my 
friend with the Cadillac. He picked me up, 
and we headed home. I had hiked the 
Metro-North with no close calls, no arrests, 
no glorious discoveries, and precious little 
of the adventure and self-discovery I had 
imagined. 72.5 miles of track behind me, 
and all I had was a new foam hat.
