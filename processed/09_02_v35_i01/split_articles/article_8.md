The Art of War 
IN A SCENE PROM Alive from Palestine: 
Stories 
Under Occupation, 
a 
couple 
exchanges a bullet and a gas canister as 
tokens of love. Mounds of crumpled news-
papers are the only scenery. The play 
debuted in the United States at New 
Haven's Long WharfTheater in late June as 
part of the annual International Festival of 
Arts and Ideas. It offered New Haveners a 
glimpse of life in Palestine and a rare 
chance to experience Palestinian art first-
hand. The series of dramatic vignettes were 
delivered in Arabic, with English surticles, 
by members of AJ Kasaba, an acting troupe 
based in the West Bank city of Rarnallah. 
Invited to New Haven by Festival organiz-
ers as the second intifada raged in 
Jerusalem, the actors asked their audience 
to "see and hear us as no longer a news item 
but as we are: Palestinians, living, dying, 
crying, laughing, commiserating, strug-
gling for a normal existence against a back-
drop of uncertainty." 

The Festival sponsored the play as part 
of its summer repertoire. Mary Miller, the 
Festival's director, attributed the play's 
selection to its artistic merit. "The criteria 
is artistic excellence," she told The New 
York Times. Before premiering in the 
United States at the Long Wharf, Alive 
from Palestine had played at the London 
International Theatre Festival and was met 
with positive reviews and little controversy. 
Miller saw the play as a good fit with the 
mission of the Festival. But in the weeks 
before Alive from Pakstine opened in New 
Haven, doubtful members of New Haven's 
Jewish community raged at her explana-
tion. 

Their main concern was a state contri-
bution of $1.4 million to the Festival, 
meaning the play-in which Israelis are 
referred to as "the wicked ones" -was 
funded in parr by public dollars. Jewish 
community leaders derided the selection as 
insensitive, inappropriate, and "bigoted" 
and charged that it "demonizes" and 
"stereotypes" Israelis. Critics also protested

that by showing the Palestinian perspective, 
the Festival had the responsibility of show-
ing the Israeli viewpoint as well. Despite 
the claim of AI Kasaba and Festival orga-
nizers-that the play should be viewed 
only as art-David Waren, the regional 
director of the Connecticut office of the 
Anti-Defamation League, described the 
play as "pure political propaganda." 

The play's inclusion sparked a crusade 
against the Festival itself. In The jewish 
udgt'1'-which turned the issue into front-
page news for much of the summer-an 
editorial described Alive from Palestine as "a 
rotten apple that tain 
whole barrel." 

The editorial urged r 
rs to take action: 
"The show should not go on. This play 
should be withdrawn from the program. 
Ask Governor Rowland to do something 
about this now. Call his office at 860-566-
4840." A resident of Waterbury said, "With 
more than 95 percent of the Palestinians in 
the West Bank and Gaza living under their 
own self-government, 'a play about life 
under Israeli occupation' would be appro-
priate for a festival about the art of propa-
ganda, but it is not appropriate for a festi-
val of arts and ideas." 

There was no public 
consensus in the Jewish 
community about what 
course of action should 
have been taken rekard-
ing the play. Editorials 
and letters from Jews 
from all over the New 
Haven area flooded local 
newspapers, calling for a 
wide range of responses. 
Some Jews 'encouraged 
people to see the play, 
stating that ALive from 
Palestine was "necessary 
viewing" and engaged 
people in a civil dialogue 
on the issue. Waren did 
not call for the play's 
withdrawal, 
instead 
demanding that .organizers "achieve a 
degree of balance" by including an equiva-
lent Israeli performance. (At least one local 
Rabbi managed to find a bright side to the 
controversy: "They're making an in 
Rarnallah? How wonderful!") 

In response to the outcry, the Festival 
added a series of post-play discussions to 
provide a forum for debate on the role of 
art in politics and politics in art. (They also 
installed electronic security check-points at 
the theater's entrance.) But the show had to 
go on, or at least that's how Miller saw it. 
And it did, selling out all five nights it was 
performed. 

Alive from Paksti.ne put the Jewish 
community-a demographic not typically 
associated with censorship or conser-
vatism-in an awkward position. The 
Anti-Defamation League, one of the 
groups initially outraged by the play's 
inclusion in the Festival, recognizes the 
importance of free speech when it comes to 
the Ku Klux Klan, a group with an obvious 
political agenda, and adamantly defends 
the right of political extremist groups to 
express hateful views in public. The actors, 
for their part, deny that they have a politi-
