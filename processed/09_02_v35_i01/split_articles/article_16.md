IN THE PRESS TO MOVE CASES PEOPLE CAN 
DISAPPEAR BEHIND DOCKET NUMBERS. 
come co temporarily surrender custody of 
her rwo children and turn herself in co 
police. On May 9, officers had raided 
Jaquerca's apartment while she was our and 
found a stash of drugs she now claims 
belonged to her brothers and cousin. Three 
weeks later, an officer knocked on her door, 
again while she was out. Fearing the worse, 
she called a policeman she had known since 
childhood and learned that a warrant with 
a bond of s1oo,ooo had been issued for her 
arrest. "Ever since that day," she said, "I 
haven't been eating. I haven't been sleeping. 
I've been sick all this week. My stomach 
hurts. I know there's no way I can come up 
with that money. I've been staying at a 
friend's house. I'm afraid to come home 
and that the police'll see me." 

Jaquetca continued co attend the 
weekly probation meetings for her only 
previous 
offense, 
another 
possession 
charge. (She had been riding in a stolen car 
with her cousin when police pulled over 
the vehicle and found several bags of crack 
cocaine under the front seat. She served no 
jail rime and diligently attended probation 
meetings every week for the past year.) Her 
probation officer remained ignorant of the 
warrant until the week Jaquerca "got 
scared" and missed a meeting. When he 
called tO find out why, she explained rhc 
situation to him, saying that she wanted co 
"just turn myself in and get ic over with," 
bur was terrified of being unable to make 
bond should the judge decide to keep it at 
sroo,ooo. By the end of the phone call, 
Jaquerta had resolved to encrust her chil-
dren ro relatives and cake her chances in 
court. "I don't wanna sign over my kids to 
nobody," she said, fighting back tears out-
side the Probate Court. "I don't wanna go 
SI!PTRMBER 2 0 02 
to jail. I don't wanna lose my apartment. 
But I know I don't have chat kind of 
money." 

The next morning Jaquctta was 
arraigned in New Haven court. After con-
sidering the charges-possession, posses-
sion with intent co sell, and violation of 
probation-the judge set bond at $175,000. 
Jaquetta would have ro pay a bondsman 7 
to 10 percent of chat, up to $17,500, co 
make bail. Following arraignment, Jaquctta 
returned co a prison cell, where she 
remained until her court dace on August 15. 
In many ways, Jaquetta's story typifies 
the kind of mass-produced justice that goes 
on in New Havcn's GA court. She stands 
accused of possession and violation of pro-
bation, cwo of the most common criminal 
offenses. She has only one previous convic-
tion and no history of violence. She con-
tinued ro attend probation after learning of 
the warrant for her arrest and then volun-
tarily turned herself in. She has strong fam-
ily ties and has been a long-time member of 
the community. All of this suggests chat she 
would be neither a serious flight risk nor a 
danger to the public. So why is Jaquetta 
Robinson in jail? 

In practice, when determining bail, 
judges have little time to consider the pre-
scribed factors, especially in overcrowded 
GA courts. The average arraignment cakes 
about five minutes, sometimes less. In chat 
time, the judge gets only a snapshot of each 
case--the defense's position, the prosecu-
tion's posicion, the police report, and the 
bail commtsstoner's recommendation. 
"Sitting in the GA is Like being a pan-time 
traffic cop, a part-rime psychologist and a 
part-rime social worker," says Judge Susan 
Handy, the Chief Administrative Judge of 
Connecticut's Criminal Division. "We just 
have to do the best we can on each case." 
Ultimately, the guidelines for judges co 
follow arc just that-guidelines. A judge 
has absolute discretion when determining 
bail. "Until challenged, a judge could justi-
fy almost any bond," says Judge Handy. 
"Certain judges will assess certain cases dif-
ferently. You can assemble a room full of 
judges and the range of bail for the same 
crime can vary from s5,000 co $250,000. 
It's their individual decision." Handy 
admits chat she rarely takes financial 
resources into consideration when deter-
mining bail, choosing instead to focus on 
the nature of the crime. Whether the 
defendant is a woman from the projects or 
an uptown heiress does not sway her deci-
sion, though another judge might consider 
wealth a crucial factor in deciding bail. 

Judges also emphasize chat in many 
cases bail isn't used to merely ensure the 
defendant's 
reappearance. 
And 
even 
defense attorneys agree that when a person 
has been charged with a particularly egre-
gious crime, public safety should take 
precedence over personal freedom. If some-
one commies the same crime multiple 
times, judges consider this pattern, even 
when the crime is nonviolent. This is often 
the case with drug-related offenses, like 
Jaquetta's, in which the recidivism race 
tends co be high. 

In letter at least, the system does offer 
recourse for defendants who believe their 
bail is too high. Following arraignment, the 
defense can file a motion to reduce bond 
and continue to petition the court until the 
bond is reduced or the case is dropped. "I 
chink certainly in my experience, [the 
defendant's] attorney will file a motion for 
bond modification if they believe their 
bond is unjust," says Judge Handy. ''After 
all, that's the only way we know if someone 
thinks a bond is unfair." 

But an appeal, a defendant's only 
recourse against unfair bail, can take 
time--time the accused spends in jail away 
from family, work, and other responsibili-
ties. "I don't care if the appellate court 
bends over backwards to expedite motions 
to review and get a quick hearing out," says 
Hugh Keefe, a New Haven defense attor-
ney. "And I think ordinarily they do "give 
them quicker attention than other things, 
but it nonetheless rakes time .... I don't 
care if it's as lirde as a week or two weeks, 
those are seven or fourteen days where you 
have a defendant incarcerated who in many 
cases shouldn't be incarcerated." 

Whether a defendant can make bail 
may also play a role in determining how 
long he spends in jail if convicted. "In some 
of these cases," says Keefe, "people will do 
more time because they can't make bail 
than they will do ultimately if and when 
they are convicted." A defendant out on 
bail has a much easier time assisting in his 
own defense. He is more accessible to his 
attorney and can help in the process of 
gathering evidence and in finding witness-
es to testifY on his behalf. Attorneys fr~m 
different racial and socio-economic back-
grounds than their clients sometimes find 
it difficult to locate witnesses in unfamiliar 
neighborhoods that are distrustful of out-
siders. In the case of Derek Shaw, it was 
months before the boy's attorney learned of 
a witness who could vouch for Derek's 
whereabouts at the time of the robbery, and 
still longer before he could locate the boy. 
"It makes it much more difficult to handle 
a case from the defense perspective if a 
client's incarcerated," says Torn Ullman, 
head public defender for the New Haven- · 
Meriden Judicial District. "Once a client's 
out, you can go to their home. You can go 
to the scene of the alleged incident. There 
are things you can do--you can find wit-
nesses more easily. There are many reasons 
that are advantageous for the defense to 
have someone out on bond." 

Public defenders, for their part, plead 
a lack of resources and an overWhelming 
caseload. Throughout the scare, the Office 
of the Public Defender handles the largest 
percentage of cases in the GA courts, some-
times as much as 63 percent in large urban 
centers like New Haven. Were public 
defenders to appeal every bond they 
thought unreasonable, the appellate court 
might be moved to question what some 
judges in New Haven consider reasonable 
bond. But then there are the clients to con-
sider. As Ullman admits, "The practical 
solution from the defense is never to cave 
in on those kinds of eases. But sometimes 
you'll have angry clients who are sitting in 
jail who demand to get out and have the 
right to plead or not depending on what 
the offer is. So it's hard to say, 'Look, on 
principle, sit in there for another three 
months while I fight this for you.'" 


**Title: "POOR PEOPLE SIT IN JAIL BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS TO MAKE BONDS. IT'S A COERCIVE SITUATION."**
**Page number(s): 21**

In a current, highly publicized case, 
Judge Joan Alexander imposed a bond of 
$2.5 million on John Paolella, a local 
bondsman charged with forging millions of 
dollars in phony bail bonds. At a bond 
hearing on July 19, Hugh Keefe, Paolella's 
lawyer, challenged the bond before 
Superior Courr Judge Holly Abery-
Wetstone, calling it "blatandy excessive" 
and an "abusive discretion" of the court's 
authoriry. "We have a man with no prior 
record," an outraged Keefe told the court. 
THE NEW JouRNAL 
"He is 28-years-old, has no history of vio-
lence. He has lived in this community his 
entire life." He made reference to cases in 
his long career as a defense attorney in 
which violent offenders were released on 
much lower bail, including a capital mur-
der case in New London where the defen-
dant was out on house arrest. When Keefe 
pressed Abery-Wetstone to justifY main-
taining the $2.5 million bond, she replied, 
"It makes sense when the defendant perpe-
trated a fraud on the Court, which is what 
happened this case." Keefe, stunned, 
informed the judge that she had just 
"reversed the presumption of innocence," 
essentially prejudging the case. There is no 
provision in Connecticut statute to justifY a 
higher bond for a fraud against the court as 
opposed to any other institution. Judge 
Abery-Wetstone eventually lowered the 
bond to $1 million, which Paolella's family 
managed to post with the aid of a bonds-
man. 

But not everyone can afford the 
bondsman's fee, and those who cannot are 
far more likely to put forth a guilty plea 
when the alternative is jail. "Poor people sit 
in jail because they don't have the funds to 
make bonds," says Ullman. "It's a coercive 
situation .... It puts people in the position 
where if their choice is to take a disposition 
that results in their freedom versus being 
locked up in jail another month, it's obvi-
ous what the choice is going to be." 


**Title: D.EREK SHAW HAS SPENT OVER 240 DAYS IN JAIL SINCE HIS ARREST AT THE END OF LAST YEAR.**

D 
ER.EK SHAW HAS SPENT OVER 240 DAYS 
in jail since his arrest at the end of last 
SEPTEMBER 2002 
year. After his latest appearance in court, 
another hasty and inconclusive proceeding, 
Derek's attorney spoke with Dora Shaw in 
a corner of the GA courthouse's cavernous 
central hall. Earlier that week, he had cold 
her he expected Derek to receive a bond 
reduction that would enable his family to 
pay a bondsman for his release. "If we can 
get him out of there, we'll take it all the 
way to trial if we have to," he had said con-
fidently at the time. But the reduction had 
failed to materialize, and he was consider-
ing other options. "I don't think we should 
fight this thing unless we can get him out," 
he explained to Derek's downcast mother. 
"All he wants is out of there and you want 
him home. I can talk to the prosecutor and 
see if she'll give us a good deal. He may 
only get a couple years. He might even get 
out before the case would have gone to 
trial." Suddenly, Derek's chance to prove 
his innocence and the state's chance to 
establish his guilt no longer mattered. If 
Derek pleaded guilty, his family would not 
have to worry about bail, the state would 
not have to build a case, and Derek, guilty 
or not, would go home. 
Derek Shaw and Dora Shaw 
are pseu®nyms.
