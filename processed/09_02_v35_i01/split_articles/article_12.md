N THE EARLY HOURS OP SEJYfEMBF.R 19, 1999, five white men 
chased down and assaulted a Yale student of Asian descent oucside 
a Howe Street laundromat. The Yale Police Department classified 
the attack as a "violent crime with apparent racial undertones" but 
released few details of the case to the public. According to rumors, 
the assailants shouted the word "chink" before they stomped the 
victim's head into the ground, puncturing his eardrum. Some 
believed the attackers robe Yale football players. Within a matter of 
weeks, the Asian American Srudenrs Association (AASA) scheduled a 
silent vigil and a Dwight Hall town meeting on hare crime, and the 
group's political action chair, Lee Wang, wrote an impassioned, but 
largely unsuccessful, plea in the Yttl~ Daily Nnus for public discus-
sion of the case. 

But as student organizadons rallied against rhe assault, investi-
gators struggled to pur a case together. Several witnesses came for-
ward, bur the victim refused to press charges. W ithout his coopera-
tion, the police could do lictlc to determine who was responsible for 
the arrack or even whether it was racially motivated. "We've inves-
tigated it as far as we can go at this time," YPD Chief]ames Perrotti 
announced that November. "Right now we've been unable to deter-
mine definitively who committed the assaults." At the end of the 
year, the case remained unsolved. 

The mystery of the attack left the Yale community frustrated 
and confused. While minority groups were up in arms, many stu-
dents and administrators were not convinced that race played a 
decisive role in the assault. "As I remember rhe incident," Dean of 
Student Affairs Betty Trachtenberg cold me, "there was a major 
alcoholic component to it." For many, it was hard co imagine char 
serious racial violence could happen ar a place like Yale, especially 
in 1999. Just two years earlier, the Minority Recruitment Program 
had launched a spare of open houses, phone-a-thons, and fly-ours 
to increase minority recruitment for the class of 2002. And in the 
spring of 1999, only a few monrhs before the alleged racial attack, 
Yale had made two ocher substantial moves: President Richard 
levin and Provost Alison Richard launched an initiative ro increase 
faculty diversity, and the Pre-Registration Orientation Program 
(PROP), a week-long orientation program for students of color in 
the freshman class, was revamped and renamed "Cultural 
Connections." 

In the wake of a potentially explosive situation, Yale managed 
to escape with remarkably few scrapes and bruises. A visit this year 
to Cultural Connections shows how, while the program could not 
stop the assault from occurring, it may have played a vital role in 
making sure it ended without incident, and without redress.

NE MORNING IN AuGUST, one hundred members of the Yale 
class of 2.006 and I caught a bus to a pow-wow. The group--
here early for Cultural Connections-was headed for the 
Mashentucker Pequot Reservation in eastern Connecticut. We 
would be attending the annual Schemitzun celebration, a gathering 
of 500 Native American groups, to experience traditional dancing 
and singing firsr-hand. 

T he ostensible goal of Cultural Connections is two-fold: to 
help incoming minorities meet studentS and administrators of color 
whom they might otherwise have difficulty finding and to intro-
duce them ro Yale's academic and extra-curricular resources. What 
that means, in concrete terms, is a lor of social events, such as the 
trip we were taking, and a slew of panels, lectures, and discussions. 
As the director of the program, Dean Saveena Dhall, pur it to me, 
"We're just trying ro do things that are going to bring people of dif-
ferent communities together, introducing them to various academ-
ic resources, introducing them to the cultural centers." 

At the pow-wow I hopped off the bus and walked into a clus-
ter of tents with a group of cc participantS. Dean Dhall had biUed 
the event as something of a cultural experience--"dancing and 
singing"-bur ro my surprise, I found at first only peddling: rows 
and rows of stalls seUing handicrafts, trinkets, and food. Among the 
items for sale were "Indian medicine bags;" fox, coyote, and wolf 
skins; pottery; wampum jewelry; moccasins; car decals; expensive 
herbal shampoos; and co's by the rapper Litefoot. One stall fea-

But if the political role of Cultural 
Connections benefits the students, 
it benefits the administration as well. 
tured an array of gimmicky t-shirts. 
Emblazoned on them were messages like 
" NBA: Native by Ancestry," " FBI: Full 
Blooded Indian," "Native Honey," and, of 
course, "United We Stand: USA, Home of 
the Brave." Food vendors were selling deli-
cacies: fry bread; buffalo, elk, and caribou 
burgers; "gator bites"; and corn cakes. 

Cultural Connections was not always 
like this. This marked just the second year 
that the program went to Scheminun and 
just the fourth that it included a strong 
multicultural component. Originally, the 
program served as an intensive remedial 
workshop 
called 
the 
Puerto 
Rican 
Orientation Program (PROP). PROP existed 
mainly to ensure that the writing and math 
skills of Yale's incoming Puerto Rican stu-
dents marched chose of their more privi-
leged peers. Over the years, as Yale's student 
body diversified, PROP opened its doors to 
all minorities, and eventually changed its 
name to the "Pre-Registration Orientation 
Program." But by 1999, many felt that the 
program's remedial emphasis was outdated 
and inappropriate. "Students felt chat the 
acronym PROP had a rather negative con-
notation, that outside people felt that the 
kids who were coming to PROP needed to 
be 'propped up,"' Betty Trachtenberg told 
me. "It became in some people's eyes a 
pejorative concept." So Rick Chavolla, the 
director of PROP at the time, changed the 
name of the program to "Cultural 
Connections" and replaced remedial activi-
ties with events like the pow-wow, a poetry 
jam, and panels on cultural and racial 
issues at Yale. 

In the past several years, however, 
Cultural Connections has taken heat from 
critics who claim that the program rein-
forces racial divisions at Yale by separating 
12 
minonues from their white peers before 
school starts. Dean Dhall was quick to cell 
me that such talk has no validity, at one 
point even handing me a clipping from the 
undergraduate 
race 
magazine 
ITPE 
authored by two c c participants -
Jonathan Farmer, an African American, 
and Ameer Kim El-Mallawany, a half-
Korean, half-Egyptian-about how the 
two of them, against all odds, became best 
friends at the program. "Uon and I], we 
might've been acquaintances had it not 
been for that blessed program," it read. 
"We rnight've been. I mean I'm talking 
fraction-of-a-percent-style here ... Me and 
Jon are friends because in a perfect world, 
we would've been. And for a week, we were 
in a world that was perfect enough." 

It is precisely because of the new mul-
ciculrural 
philosophy, 
supporters of 
Cultural Connections say, that the program 
does not advocate separatism. Dhall points 
to the fact that Cultural Connections has 
coordinated a number of events with other 
preorientation programs in the last few 
years. This year, cc participants attended 
an ice cream social with members of the 
Freshman Outdoor Orientation Trip 
(FOOT) program, a barbecue on Old 
Campus with the football team, the 
Orientation for International Students 
(01s) program, the Freshman Counselors, 
and FOOT, and a "Game Night" party with 
OIS. "You really gee a feel for how co inter-
act with people unlike yourself at cc," for-
mer participant and aide Taiwo Stanback 
cold me. Despite the face that cc is partly 
about "stressing your identity," she said, 
"it's an opportunity co mix and mingle 
with people unlike yourself." Dean Dhall 
made a similar point: "You can't say that 
we're creating a single kind of student; 
we're actually facilitating a lor of interac-
tions within [the minority community]." 

N THE DECADES BEFORE PROP CAME INTO 
existence, minorities at Yale were few and 
far between. The number of non-whites 
per class never numbered more than a few 
dozen. When William Ashby, an African 
American student at the School of Religion 
in the early 20TH century, helped organize 
Yale's first black fraternity, Alpha Phi 
Alpha, there were only 16 black students at 
the whole university. By the 1960s, the 
numbers had only increased to about 15 per 
class. 

But in 1964, the situation began to 
change. That year, all 14 black freshmen 
joined together to form what would, two 
years later, be called the Black Student 
Alliance at Yale (BSAY). Initially, the group 
focused on social issues at Yale. "We got 
together because we felt a need co assert our 
sense of positive self-identification," orga-
nizer Armstead Robinson told the Yale 
Alumni Magazine in 1969. "Mixers were 
really bad; we tried to create a normal social 
situation for ourselves." But in 1967, the 
group turned its gaze to an even more 
pressing issue: the Yale curriculum. BSAY 
undertook an intensive study of the cur-
riculum and entered into intense negotia-
tions with President Kingman Brewster, 
Provost Charles Taylor, and Dean George 
May about the possibility of creating an 
African 
American 
Studies 
program. 
Surprisingly, the administration was open 
to the students' demands. As Caroline 
Jackson Smith, a Yale student in the early 
1970s and director of the African American 
Cultural Center in the 198os, described the 
situation co me, "Yale did a very unique 
thing... [President Brewster] said, 'Come
