Though the resemblance is
unintentional, the baby repre-

The
~ '
book runs chronological-
ly from fetus-hood to Little League
with chapters interspersed recounting various parts of the author's
own childhood and parenting experience.
The best parts of the book are Schoenstein's well-researched
and astutely analyzed tales of the opportunities available to upper-
class parents in the United States. There is a "bull market in bull-
shit for babies," and Schoenstein addresses a whole battery of gim-
micks for what he calls "career moms," "fast-track dads," and
"resume-raising parents." At The Institute For The Achievement Of
Human Potential in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania, for example, kids
begin reading programs at the tender age of three months. Using
sound bytes from conversations with child psychologists and pedi-
atricians, Schoenstein provokes a few funny, though predictable,
exchanges with the employees of the Institute. Quoting some stud-
ies conducted by one child development specialist at Tufts
University, Schoenstein suggests to an Institute employee that chil-
dren learn to read better at a later age and that "the pressure for early
reading reflects the parents' need, nor the child's." The conversation
abruptly ends when the Institute employee disregards Schoenstein's
point: "Well, he [the specialist] better study some new children.
And you'd better visit us and forget about Tufts."
Schoenstein also spends time at a Bright Start Learning Center,
where parents are reminded in a
brochure that "when children
put blocks in trucks and dump
them out, they are learning to
understand size, weight, and
number concepts . . . When
children put on dress-up
clothes, they are learning
small muscle skills." High-
end day-care centers like
this one can cost parents as
much as $17,000 per year.
(Apparently,
the
extra
money goes toward the
sophisticated hermeneu-
tics of playtime.) After
watching two teachers
try to give mashed-pota-
to-chucking one-year-
olds a zoology quiz,
Schoenstein
suggests
that Bright Start has misinter-
preted the scholastic behavior of toddlers. "When chil-
dren throw mashed potatoes," Schoenstein glibly interrupts, "they
are learning to request boiled or fried." Amidst such barely tolera-
ble scabs at humor writing, Schoenstein does make the valid point
that sometimes children simply play and that to assign importance
and to measure potencial in every childish activity reflects a trou-
bling collective neurosis. This daycare center had turned blocks into
quizzes and snack time into lesson time, even reprimanding one
child for climbing the jungle gym off schedule. It seems to
Schoenstein that, unfortunately, "While trying to produce Mensa
mites, push-parents can't schedule that sweet time-waster called
play, for which there are no Cliffs Notes."
Among the gimmicks aimed at over-educated, over-ambitious,
over-zealous parents is Bloom's book, an anthology of stories and
poems supposedly for consumption by minors. Its title is character-
istically Bloomsian. He makes no apologies and does not skirt the
issue. This book is intended for parents who fancy their children to

be "Extremely lntelligenc."-dever mar-
keting to the intellectual masses. After all,
what Bloom fan wouldn't consider his own
children to be of the highest caliber? The
book is billed as Bloom's Cliffs Notes for
modern childhood but looks more like the
Cliffs Notes for his own. He claims to have
discovered, read, and reread every work in
the anthology during his own youth and
recommends that today's children "perse-
vere" and do the same. Bloom laments the
loss of a slow-paced, literature intensive
childhood in the introduction to his book:
I am old-fashioned and romantic
enough to believe that many chil-
dren, given the right circum-
stances, are natural readers until
this instinct is destroyed by the
media. The tyranny of the screen
threatens any order in which liter-
ary value or human wisdom can
be preferred to the steady flow of
information. It may be an illusion
to believe that the magical con-
nection of solitary children to the
best books can endure, but such a
relationship does go so long a way
back that it will not easily expire.
The selections in the book suggest a nostal-
gic Bloom dreaming of the young, patient,
Edwardian reader of yesteryear. The very
tide of the book, however, capitalizes on
every Schoenstein parent's need for instant
gratification.
The 500-page collection of pre-wwr
poems and tales, by the likes of Kipling,
Shakespeare, Dickens, Blake, Emerson,
and Whitman, is a rich compilation of lit-
erature and a far cry from the interactive
"Jump-Start Reading" co-ROMS discussed
in Schoenstein's book. The anthology
arranges the selections thematically by sea-
son. Opening with Keats's "The Human
Seasons," the first section of the book,
Spring, is fuJI of love, longing, and loneli-
ness. Summer is rich with humor, color,
and energy, inclu~g classics like Carroll's
"Humpty Dumpty" and Kipling's "Rikki-
T'akki-Tavi," as well as more obscure,
though equally pleasurable, stories like
S£i>'r£MBER 2002
"Uncle David's Nonsensical Story About
Giants and Fairies" by Catherine Sinclair.
Not much of it is accessible to children,
though. The book is like an undergraduate
English degree on the wall of a doctor's
office: impressive but of no practical value.
Bloom anticipates this criticism by
distancing himself from modern notions of
"Children's Literature." According to
Bloom, the very idea of Children's
Literature "had some use and distinction a
century ago, but now all too often is a mask
for the dumbing-down that is destroying
our literary culture. Most of what is now
commercially offered as children's literature
would be inadequate fare for any reader of
any age at any time." H e urges the "authen-
tic reader" of this book to take on the col-
lection as an opportunity to discover his
own potential as well as the potential of ini-
tially obscure or difficult pieces to open up
and enterrain.
The MTV generation, the information
age, the video game society: These tropes
have been used ad nauseum, but like most
cliches, there is some truth to them. Left to
their own volition, most children today
will turn on the TV or the computer; left to
their parents', they are more likely to fall
victim to one of the mothers parodied in
Schoenstein's
book-shuttled
from
Chinese tutoring to bassoon lessons to
gymnastics practice. Schoenstein self-
indulgently devotes a whole chapter to an
all-American neighborhood stickball game
starring himself as the new kid in town.
The chapter is a hardly bearable play-by-
play of a heroic outfield catch, but at the
root of his reminiscence lies a sad truth:
Children today no longer seem to play.
Schoenstein writes, "A kid today, who has a
curriculum instead of a childhood, who has
never known the heady feeling of actually
making his own plans, still often says, 'I'm
bored."'
.
For the few children who actually read
the bulk of Bloom's anthology, a wealth of
great literarure lies within. It may be true,
as Bloom claims, that for children to find
their way to Shakespeare, Chekhov, and
Austen, they must start with Kipling,
Stevenson, and Carroll, but Bloom's Ivy
Tower reality does not recognize that that is
no longer where kids want to end up. If the
ultimate
objectives
of Bloom
and
Schoenstein are to resuscitate a lost age of
childhood whimsy, whether it be stickball
or Arthur Conan Doyle, both offer a vision
that is tragically narrow and sentimentally
personalized.
While both authors take the opportu-
nity to romanticize childhood of yesteryear,
neither has any sense of contemporary
American childhood. The books are aimed
at neurotic parents full of high hopes for
their kids. Even the average yuppie, howev-
er, will be alienated by the selections in
Bloom's book and the Hunter, Dalton,
Greenwich inside jokes that are dropped
throughout Schoenstein's. As Schoenstein
ridicules the ambitious, Ivy-~nclined par-
ents of today, it becomes painfully obvious
that he runs in the same circle. Though the
book often aspires to real social criticism,
Schoenstein is more interested in gabbing
about his daughter's Little League team, his
own days at Stuyvesant High School in
New York, and his grandson's knack for
geography. He passes up chances for serious
commentary, making trite and esoteric
jokes instead. His ideal reader is one of the
very parents he is criticizing: someone who
will be in on the jokes and uncomfortable
with any real criticism. Bloom's book,
meanwhile, claims to encourage explorato-
ry reading habits of days long forgotten.
This stated purpose, however, is belied by
the book's selling point: Srori~s and Tales for
Extremely Intelligent Children is a quick-fix
book for children and parents who don't
have rime to explore. Both books, ulti-
mately, are little more than household
decor. Schoenstein's should sit stacked with
his other books on top of a toilet as occa-
sionally amusing bathroom reading while
Bloom's should grace the color-coordinated
Ethan Allen bookshelf above some
Westchester baby's crib.
