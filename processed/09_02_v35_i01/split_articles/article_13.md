in and let's negotiate. If you can prove to 
me that these demands are reasonable, then 
we should work on them in a reasonable 
way."' 

Eight months after BSAY held a nation-
al symposium on African American 
Studies, the faculty of Yale College unani-
mously approved the creation of a major in 
African American Studies. It was the first 
black studies program at an elite university. 
Soon BSAY procured a Cultural Center, a 
dean of black students, and a minority 
~ruitment progtam. After the assassina-
tion of Martin Luther lGng, Jr. in 1968, 
African American admission numbers 
increased as well. "In our minds, it was very 
important that we not just have the experi-
ence that some of our parents had," 
Jackson Smith told me. "Their experiences 
wac, 'You're a single black person. You 
don't bring the black experience with you, 
you just try to fit in.' Our generation was 
like, 'We're coming in big numbers, and we 
don't just want to be here--we want to be 
here as ourselves.'" At that point, the flood-
pees opened for other minority groups. 
Within the next ten years, cultural centers 
and deans for Latinos and Asian Americans 
appeared. PROP was just one part of that 
development. 

What stood out most about the push 
for integration in the 1960s and 70s was 
the f.act that the process was almost entire-
ly non-violent. Unlike Cornell, where 
armed students occupied the student 
union, Yale sat down and negotiated calm-
ly. The result has been 30 years of relatively 
lteady and peaceful interaction between 
the administration and students on issues 
of race. But it has also meant that Yale's 
administration, through deans, cultural 
~nters, and programs like Cultural 
.. 
Connections, has had a high degree of 
influence over race organizations on cam-
pus. 

L
ADIES 
AND 
GENTLE-
MEN, welcoming you 
to their territory, here they 
are, 
the 
Mashantucket 
Pequot tribal people and 
the Eastern Pequot tribal 
nation! Let's give them a 
big round of applause as 
they welcome you to their 
territory for the annual 
Schemiiiiinun 
celebra-
tion!" The emcee's voice 
issued from a large tent. I 
walked inside toward a 
group of cc participants 
and watched as a line of 
Native Americans in tra-
ditional dress screamed 
into the tent to resounding 
drum beats. "Here come 
Iroquois 
smokedancers!" 
shouted 
the emcee. "Wave to the 
people, smokedancers! GIVE 
IT UUUUP! Iroquois style in 
the house!" Over the next 
hour or so, more than a 
thousand people represent-
ing tribal groups from across 
the United States, Canada, 
and 
Mexico-from 
Onondaga to the Aztecs-
filled up the tent. "The true heartbeat of 
our people! What a beautiful sight!" 

If Cultural Connections exists to make 
the transition to college easier for minority 
students, it also serves a purpose similar to 
that of the Schemiczun pow-wow: to create 
solidarity among disparate 
minority 
groups. In that way, Cultural Connections 
takes on a distinctly political role. As Alexis 
Hoage, an aide, put it, 
"With 
Cultural 
Connections, it's con-
necting the different 
minority groups, just 
because there are situa-
tions at Yale where stuff 
happens and there need 
to be coalitions for that. 
Ir sounds cheesy, but you 
make those initial little 
personal 
connections 
with incoming ~hmen 
and they're gonkt stick 
around three years later 
when you're trying to 
tackle MLK day." Taiwo 
Stanback agreed that Cultural 
Connections can 
be 
an 
important tool for effecting 
change. "Basically, Yale is a 
microcosm of the United 
States," she told me. "And 
until the United States 
changes, the [racial] prob-
lems are still going to be 
there. Cultural Connections 
is a way of dealing with 
those problems." 

The kinds of problems 
that Stanback and Hoage 
are referring to include 
incidents like the one in the Morse College 
dining hall last January. When junior 
David Ahn, a Korean American, suggested 
to the dining hall management team that 
they put on a Korean theme dinner, 
Manager Brian Frantz jokingly replied, 
"What would that be? Dog$â€¢and kimchi?"

In a much-publicized letter to the Korean American Students of 
Yale (KASY), Ahn described his reaction to the comment as 
"shocked" and "offended." He later ftled a report to make sure that 
the incident would go on Frantz's record. As trivial as the event 
seemed to some, it proved an important catalyst for the formation 
of perhaps the first broad coalition of minority groups at Yale. In 
the spring, an emerging organization called the Pan-Ethnic 
Coalition presented a resolution on cultural sensitivity, drafted by 
the Asian American Student Association (AASA) and ratified by all 
the major cultural groups on campus, to Dean Trachtenberg. 
Among the resolution's requests were cultural sensitivity training 
workshops for incoming freshmen. "Tension and resentment dear-
ly exist when it comes to cultural differences and problems that arise 
from it," part of the resolution reads. "Incidents such as the remark 
by the Morse dining hall manager serve only to create a threatening 
atmosphere. They devalue the distinctive contributions of the indi-
viduals affected and impair their ability to contribute to the com-
munity. By alienating those individuals, they harm the whole Yale 
community." Dean Trachtenberg says that she plans to work with . 
the Pat-Ethnic Coalition in the coming months. 

if the political role of Cultural Connections benefits 
minority students, it obviously benefits the administration as well. 
The program represents a major opportunity for administrators-
specifically, the three cultural deans, who all make appearances at 
cc-to form close relationships with participants, aides, and even 
ethnic counselors who, down the road, will very likely play impor-
tant roles in campus activism. Of the dozen or so aides I met when 
I visited Cultural Connections, almost all were involved to some 
degree in activist groups, such as BSAY and AASA, or the cultural 
houses. When incidents such as the "dogs and kimchi" affair occur, 
the task of keeping the situation under control is that much easier 
for administrators, who already know many student activists, some-
times very personally. 

In the spring of 2001, this became all too clear. In the April 
Fools' Day issue of the Yak Daily N~s. Michael Horn, managing 
editor of the paper, wrote a piece entided "Confessions of a Jewish 
Asian Worshipper" that satirized a number of common stereotypes 
about Asian Americans. A few days after the story came out, AASA 
sent an email to members of the Asian American community about 
the incident. Dean Dhall herself tacked on a personal message urg-
ing student protest. "As members of the Yale Asian American com-
munity," she wrote, "I hope that you will feel the need to respond, 
either on a personal level or by participating in one of our commu-
nity efforts . . . I thank you for your support and for helping us con-
structively respond to folks at the YDN of why writing that promotes 
stereotypes is unacceptable, hurtful, and offensive to members of 
the Yale community." With this memo, Dean Dhall had a unique 
influence over bow students responded to a controversial racial 
issue, an influence she might nor have had without her ties to 
Cultural Connections. 

T 
HRRE YEARS AFTER THE BEATING of the Asian American Student, 
the case is still open, according to YPO Chief James Perrorci. But 
it seems unlikely that anyone will ever know for sure whether the 
incident was ~ vicious hate crime or just a late-night, drunken 
brawl. 

Did Cultural Connections's success somehow contribute to the 
mystery shrouding the case? On the one hand, the program repre-
sents thirty years of progress for minorities at an institution that was 
once a bastion of white, Anglo-Saxon Protestantism. Not only do 
African-Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and Native 
Americans now constitute a vital part of the Yale community, they 
also possess an intricate support system consisting of cultural hous-
es, cultural deans, ethnic counselors, and an orientation program. 
On the other hand, all of that progress has come at something of a 
cost: Yale's administration- for which a hate crime, or a divisive 
community response to one, would represent a public relations 
nightmare--now boasts firm institutional cies with most under-
graduate minority organizations on campus, in part controlling 
their responses to attacks like this. Cultural Connections, in partic-
ular, is an integral part of that process. 

On the fourth day of Cultural Connections, the program's par-
ticipants crowded into a lecture hall in the Slifka Cenrer for a panel 
on "Diversity, Cultural Centers, and Being a Person of Color at 
Yale." Panelists included Rosalinda Garcia, director of La Casa 
Cultural; Pamela George, director of the African American Cultural 
Center; and three minority undergraduates. The goal of the panel 
was, at least in part, to introduce the various people and resources 
that exist at Yale to provide for students of color. But as panel mod-
erator and Assistant Dean of Yale College Edgar Letriz reminded 
the crowd, "You need to know that we are not just the directors of 
the cultural centers. We're not hired to be specialists on multicul-
turalism .... We're in fact academic deans and student affairs deans 
of Yale College." He never acknowledged, however, that the dual 
role could create conflicts of interest. As long as Cultural 
Connections continues fostering early bonds between students and 
administrators, the Yale Community risks mistaking administrative 
damage control for administrative guidance.
