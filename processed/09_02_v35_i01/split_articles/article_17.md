HIS IS THE STORY OP SOMETHING INVISIBLE. A new power line 
linking the Connecticut and Long Island electrical grids now 
lies under the floor of New Haven Harbor. Depending on whom 
you ask, its placement there last May was either a godsend co a 
nation in the throes of an energy crisis or the nail in the coffin for 
a bountiful local ecosystem and an age-old local industry. This is 
because also resting beneath the water are beds of dams and oysters 
where from out of the muck a number New Haven area fishermen 
dredge up a living day after day. On May 17, 2002, a specialized rig 
that had sailed from the Netherlands tore a trench ten feet wide and 
20 feet deep through prime oyster habitat on the harbor floor 120 
feet below the surface, making way for a 24 mile cable that weighs 
3,700 tons. Though it may be invisible, the massive cable is hardly 
innocuous. Nor is it very effective: While the cross sound cable is 
ready to start sending energy from Connecticut to power 400,000 
Long Island homes, not a single amp has passed beneadt the ocean 
floor. 

Larry WUliams owns the rights to some of the shellflsh beds 
disrurbed by the cable. A fisherman since 1973, Williams is one of 
the few who carry out New Haven's &ding legacy as a booming port 
city. "I came from nothing," Wtlliams says about his life in the 
industry. ''I've made a study of it. I loved it. And I did well." 
WUliams tells the story of the cross sound cable as he works on 
his boat, cleaning the mast and sandpapering the hull. Bamboo 
sticks line the floor of the shell, surrounded by water-worn rope and 
bait-fllled buckets. "What happened here in New Haven is unlike 
anything I've ever seen before," he says. "I know there's a whole 
story yet to be told." This is largely because the history of the cable 
is as murky as its new resting place: It is a story of back-room poli-
tics and the struggle for power over power. 


HE DAY OP THE CABLE'S INSTALLATION, the Bush administration 
released its National Energy Plan. The document pointedly crit-
icized Connecticut, and more specifically, New Haven. 
Connecticut was labeled "parochial" for "rejecting efficient modes 
of energy transmission in the name of unsubstantiated local con-
cerns." Comparing the Northeast energy crisis to last year's 
California power allocation debacle, the national report pitched 
"energy restrueturing" as a solution, explaining that in order "to 
provide ample electricity at reasonable prices, states must open their 
retail electricity markets to competition." 

That was the exact case made last January when a private New 
England-based company proposed constrUcting a 33o-megawatt 
cable beneath the sound to the Connecticut Siring Council, a state

Shoreham, a small town 60 miles east of Manhattan, lies
on Long Island's exclusive North Shore. Home to 3,000 resi-
dents, one school district, and three country dubs, Shoreham also
has one non-operational power plant on its waterfront. When it was
built in 1967, the facility was supposed to be Long Island's first and
only nuclear power plant. But when it neared completion in 1975,
15,000 local protesters gathered outside the complex and brought
the project to a halt. The plant, which cost $5Â·5 billion to build, sits
empty on a 419-acre site on the western bank of Wading River.

While New Haven tolerates four nuclear power plants in its imme-
diate vicinity, there is not a single nuclear power plant on all of
Long Island, despite rapid growth and scant resources to satisfy a
growing demand for energy. On the site of the Shoreham nuclear
plant, the cable comes ashore.

The Cross Sound Cable Company insists that the cable,
despite its local impact, serves a greater good. Their website claims
that "wherever good electric cies can link regions, the power com-
panies can aid each other, and energy is produced at the lowest pos-
sible cost. Since consumers directly feel the cost and reliability of
electricity, a project like the cross sound cable that strengthens the
pool also helps the consumer." While the cable has been promoted
for its potencial to facilitate a murual exchange of energy, in reality
power can only go in one direction at a cime: from cash-Strapped
New Haven to power-hungry Long Island. Cross Sound Cable
Company spokeswoman Rita Bowlby explains this matter of faccly:

00 OYSTER HARVESTERS WORK THE
NORTH shore of the sound, generating
s6o million annually for the regional econ-
omy, putting them first in the nation in
revenue and second in production. When
the proposal for the cross sound cable first
appeared in January, the Siting Council
probably had those statistics in mind. But
in a struggle that consisted primarily of one
company's word against another's, the task
of predicting the actual effects of the cable
proved difficult. An environmental assess-
ment by a third party had yet to take place,
and even protesters could offer only a vague
idea of the cable's concrete effects.

At the time of the first proposal, how-
ever, the Siting Council did know that
there were certain economic effects that
went beyond damage to the state's once
booming fishing industry. New Haven
Harbor is currently 35 feet deep. Other
major harbors of the eastern seaboard are
generally 15 to 20 feet deeper. Nearby New
York's, for example, is 55 feet deep.

Remaining competitive as a harbor will
inevitably require deepening, but the
cable's construction makes an expansion of
New Haven Harbor impossible.

The potential environmental implica-
tions and damage to New Haven's already
declining position as a port city make the
first unanimous rejection easy to under-
stand. The Siting Council ruled that the
cable's alleged benefits were not sufficient
to risk the pote-ncial repercussions. For a
while, it looked like the cable had been
defeated.

But by protecting its own interest,
Connecticut found itself in the national
spotlight. In the National Energy Plan
released in May, the Siring Council's
January decision is noted as a case in point
of why federal authority should be able to
override local concerns in the construction
of new electric transmission lines. By
rejecting the cable, the Siting Council fol-
lowed a law requiring that the benefits of a
proposed transmission facility go to the
individual state in which it is located,
rather than an entire region. With
President Bush's assertion offederal author-
ity comes the power of a national adminis-
tration to determine whether a transmis-
sion line can go through a state that has no
need for it-an interesting change of heart
for a dyed-in-the-wool states-rights conser-
vative. "We are now in an energy crisis,"
Bush said early in his presidency. "What
the people need to hear loud and dear is
that we're running out of energy in
America." Yet Rita Bowlby, spokeswoman
for the Cross Sound Cable Company, vehe-
mently denies that the cable is "the embod-
iment of a shifting national policy," as the
N~ Havm Regisur labeled it last summer.
"This project has nothing to do with the
national level," she says. "It is not a gov-
ernment project. It is a private project. It is
just a business deal." The apostles of ener-
gy deregulation make the same case: It is a
business deal, which allows competition in
the marketplace to lower prices and gener-
ate innovation. The one certainty is that it
is, if nothing else, a great deal for business:
The Cross Sound Cable Company stands
to make s8oo million.


OUTRACED BY THE SMOKE-AND-MIRRORS,
Connecticut Attorney General Richard
Blumenthal referred ro the Siting Council's
turnaround as "completely unjustified."
"None of the facts were different," he said,
"and the benefits to Connecticut con-
sumers in the reliability of electricity were
even less ... this was more of a political cal-
culation than a review of the merits."
Blumenthal credits the projeces realization
to a
power greater than his own.
