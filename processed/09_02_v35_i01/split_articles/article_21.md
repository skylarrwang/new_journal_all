The Things They Left Behind
HE THINGS THEY LEFT BEHIND WERE
T largely disgusting, a year's worth of
accumulated refuse: dust bunnies the size
of dinosaur eggs, emptied tins of potted
meat, q-cips clean and soiled, and, in one
room, enough body hair co have been shed
by a Yeti. Some of the trash made for a
laugh-a Bud Light sombrero, a faux-ciga-
rette hash pipe-but most left me cursing
Homo sapiens yalmsis, obviously the filthi-
est subspecies of humankind.
Yet scraps found here and there in the
junk heap told personal stories. As. you
move in, remember that when you 'move
out, you don't do so anonymously. Some
fellow students stick around at year's end
working Custodial. We know who you are
when we see what you leave, and we have
co start drinking at lunch just to cope.
Like most of us, much of our trash is
either dorky or dirty.
There were dart
guns, toy dinosaurs (I took those), rubber
snakes. In one desk drawer, a pen with
pink ink, a Backstreet Boys album, bub-
blegum, and nothing more.
Under one
couch, a cache of dildos. T here was anime
porn (a friend took it before I could); half-
empty cans of stale beer; and in a category
halfway between childish and adult, an
illicit handle of Smirnoff, rolled up in a
rug.
T hen there are the things that
only we can afford to throw away.
These include stereos and televi-
sions, refrigerators, canvas camp
chairs, torchiere lamps, futon
frames, a discman, leather jackets,

printers, dress shoes on their shoe trees, and
a hip Japanese rain jacket that folds up to
become its own bag. Most of it is hoarded
by student clean-up. crews, mad with find-
ers-keepers frenzy. What can't be reused or
resold on the September black market is
tossed into ubiquitous blue dumpsters,
where it is inevitably picked over again.
One day I swept up thirteen dollars in
coins before ten AM, only to have a co-
worker boast that he'd once found s185 in
change in a single jar. Old course books
were as good as cash at the bookstore's buy-
back counter.
At times, the litter or lack of it com-
posed biographical vignettes that made for
stark comparisons. On the windowsill of
one room littered with designer clothes and
pricey personal electronics sat a plastic cup
from Lehman Brothers brimming with golf
tees, perhaps an extra signing bonus for
some new banker. The next room over was
swept absolutely bare, nothing left behind.
But no narrative was as encapsulating
as the one contained in a forgotten card-
board box I cleared from an ov~rcrowded

storage room, its owner long since graduat-
ed.
Among the tighry-whities, plastic
bookends, pillowcases, and Dave Matthews
cos was the turbulent story of a Yalie in
love. There were prom pictures in a white
cardboard frame, then farther down, snap-
shoes of a different girl, smiling and pretti-
er chan the first. Among the old toothpaste
and crusted deodorant sticks, a packet of
birch control pills. Next co a book by John
Gaddis, a copy of 1001 Sex Secrets Every
Man Should Know Written by WOmen Who
Already Know. Inside, proceeding method-
ically up to Secret #218, a rigorous system
of checks and xs rated each of the suggest-
ed techniques. It remains unclear whether
she wrote the annotations before she gave
him the book or he compiled them as a col-
lection
of
pose-coital
notes-to-self.
Regardless, someone enjoys chan1pagne in
bed, slow dancing in the nude, a show of
vulnerability from her man, gentle use of
the tongue, hair stroking, sensitivity, and
sex where both parrners are "careful."
Deemed unacceptable are blindfolds, kinky
motels, private polaroids, oral sex, peanut
butter, lemon meringue anywhere outside
of a pie, candle wax, sex coys, homemade
pornos, bare-bottom spanking, and feath-
ers. And last, at me bottom of the box, an
emblem of me worst sort of loneliness:
shoved inside a sock and wrapped up in a
button-down shire, a home testing kit for
HIV-a relic of the lowest point, mat day
spent trying to smile while thinking alone
over and over: Oh please God no, nor me,
not now, not this.
