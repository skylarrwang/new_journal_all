N A CRJSP AFTERNOON in December, Dora Shaw sent her 15-
year-old son Derek to the store for groceries. Somewhere 
tween his house and the corner, two police officers stopped 
Derek, pinned his arms behind his back, cuffed his hands, and read 
him his rights. Derek, surprised and afraid, did not resist. The offi-
cers were holding a warrant with his name on it for armed robbery 
in the first degree. As he was escorted to a waiting patrol car, Derek 
asked if they could tell his mother why he would not be corning 
home. No, they replied, he could call her from the station. Derek 
climbed into the back seat of the patrol car and watched through 
the windshield as his neighborhood vanished from sight. 

For the past eight months, Derek has been held in two differ-
ent correctional facilities and appeared in three different courtS. He 
is currently incarcerated at the Manson Youth Institution in 
Cheshire, a level 4 high-security prison. He sees his family only at 
court appearances, where he sits across the courtroom with the 
other prisoners and wears a standard-issue orange jumpsuit, his 
ankles shackled and his hands cuffed behind his back. The state's 
evidence against Derek is an affidavit implicating him in the rob-
bery of a pizza deliveryman. The form is signed by a neighborhood 
boy with a lengthy criminal record. Derek has not been identified 
in a lineup and has no past juvenile record. He has never before 
been charged with a crime. In the eyes of the law, he is still inno-
cent. In fact, he could go home tomorrow-if his family could only 
post a $250,000 bond. 

LMOST EVERYONE ACCUSED OF COMMITTING A CRIMÂ£ in New 
A Haven will stand inside Courtroom B, a lofty, dimly lit cham-
g
oo the first floor of the Geographical Area (GA) courthouse on 
Elm Street. Courtroom B was once majestic, with ornate moldings 
and other neo-classical flourishes. Now, decades of grime and tiny 
cracks mar its walls, and the gilt hands of the old-fashioned wall 
clock no longer keep time. But when the accused are led into the 
chamber, they are probably thinking only one thing: Will I go home 
today? 

At arraignment, the first court appearance following arrest, the 
defendant hears the charges against him and enters a plea of 
"guilty,'' "not guilty,'' or "no contest." If he pleads innocent, the 
judge sets a date for further proceedings and may impose whatever 
conditions he deems appropriate to ensure the defendant's appear-
ance in court and to "protect the safety of the community." These 
conditions can range from a simple "promise-to-appear" to the pay-
ment of bail money or property given co the court by the accused 
in exchange for temporary release. While sometimes as low as $500, 
bail often runs in the hundreds of thousands or, in some cases, mil-
lions of dollars. The court returns this amount if the defendant 
comes to court and retains it if he fails to show. Most defendants 
cannot afford to post their own bail. In such cases, the accused can 
pay a non-refundable fee to a bondsman, who will then assume 
responsibility for the entire bond. If the defendant cannot afford a 
bondsman, he stays in prison until his case finds its way through the 
judicial system-a process that can span weeks, months, or should 
the case go to trial, several years. 

Connecticut state law and the Eighth Amendment of the u.s. 
Constitution require that bail not be "excessive" -that is, it should 
not exceed the minimum amount necessary to ensure a defendant's 
appearance in court. There are, of course, exceptions. If the defen-
dant has a history of violent behavior, for example, higher bail can 
be justified. But the purpose of bail is to preserve the presumption 
of innocence by ensuring that a person is not unduly punished 
before being convicted. A defendant retains 
his freedom but still has an incentive co 
return to court. Bail is a contract between 
the state and the defendant: In exchange 
for a reasonable amount of collateral, the 
state agrees to honor the defendant's pre-
sumed innocence, and the defendant agrees 
to comply with the order of the court. But 
when bail crosses the murky line between 
reasonable and excessive, this presumption 
of innocence comes under threat. Bail then 
begins to seem less like a contract and more 
like an abuse of authority. 

ONTROVERSY ERUPTED LAST jANUARY 
C when a New Haven judge imposed a 
$50,000 cash bond-a sum that must be 
posted in full without the aid of a bonds-
man-on 19-year-old Brian Warner, a 
young man charged with shoplifting five 
times in less than a year, possibly co feed a 
drug habit. When Warner could not make 
bail, he returned to jail, where the follow-
ing morning officers found hlm dead on 
the floor with a bed sheer twisted around 
his neck. 

Warner's swcide rekindled a debate 
that had first begun ro years before. In 
1991, the Hartford Courant conducted an 
in-depth investigation of Connecticut's bail 
system. The paper examined over 150,000 
cases statewide for possible abuses and 
found that judges throughout the state reg-
ularly ignored the recommendations of bail 
commissioners, third party officers who 
suggest a bail amount based on an assess-
ment of a defendant's ties to the commuru-
ty, past criminal record, employment sta-
tus, the nature of the charge, financial 
resources, and potential risk to the public. 
The study also found that black and 
Hispanic defendants without a criminal 
record had to post on average twice that of 
white defendants to get out of jail. The 
srudy singled out New Haven as the lead-
ing culprit in setting ilisproponionately 
high bonds for minority defendants and 
perry drug-offenders. (The Connecticut 
Judicial Branch commissioned its own 
study of the issue in 1992. The enterprise 
was under funded and far less comprehen-
sive than the Courant study, and its con-
clusions were ultimately both less specific 
and less damning.) A decade later, little has 
changed in Connecticut's bail system, and 
bail amounts in New Haven are still rising. 

This year, more than to,ooo people 
will pass through the doors of New Haven's 
GA court. Fewer than 400 of them will ever 
see trial. The rest must be ilisposed of as 
quickly and efficiently as the resource-
strapped system will permit. For a judge, a 
disposition-the settlement of a case before 
trial-means one less case on an already 
overcrowded docker. With such a high vol-
ume of cases, many of which will end in 
convictions, the temptation co churn out 
fast justice can sometimes overshadow the 
rights implied by the presumption of inno-
cence. In many cases, a compelling police 
report can suggest almost certain guilt. 
Because a defendant who is locked up 
pleads guilty far more rearuly than one still 
on the street, high bail simultaneously 
moves backlogged cases and punishes those 
who appear guilty from the outset, making 
it an alluring solution and a dangerous 
shortcut. A two-time drug offender back in 
court on a new charge hardly strikes a sym-
pathetic chord with a harried judge who 
has seen hundreds just like him. But to 
punish a defendant with high bail based 
solely on the likelihood of guilt amounts to 
a subversion of due process. If he has com-
mined the alleged crime, those who serve 
the system must believe it will punish the 
guilty in due time. Unfortunately, time is 
exactly what the system does not have, and 
in the press to move cases, people can dis-
appear behind docket numbers.
