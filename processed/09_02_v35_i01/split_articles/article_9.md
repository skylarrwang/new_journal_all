**Alive from Palestine**
**Author: Flora Lichtman**

cal agenda ar all. Nizar Zuabi, the play's 
director, was dismayed by the controversial 
opening in New Haven. "The play is arr," 
he told the Los Angeles Times. "It is shaped 
by political circumstances, yes, but it is 
art." In fact, some reviewers described the 
play as pretty bland fare. "The company 
has chosen not to make any reference to 
Yasir Arafat or to suicide bombers; that 
seems politically prudent, if nor chicken-
hearted .... There is little in the show chat is 
likely co inflame anyone in any new way," 
Bruce Weber wrote in a review for The New 
York Times. 

In one scene from Alive .from Pakstine, 
a man picks through his son's book bag 
afrer a bomb attack leaves the boy dead. 
The boy may not have been a political 
actor, but fell victim co a war beyond his 
conuol. T he Al Kasaba troupe may have 
arrived in New Haven co perform art, but 
they were swallowed up by a political 
fuestorm they could not contain.

**Kung Fu Fighting**

Kung Fu Fighting 
TH.B MIGHTY NEW HAVEN NINJAS, beloved 
gladiators of arenafootbalh, open every 
event co a fanfare of violins and heavy bass. 
Tonight's opponent, the Scranton/Wilkes-
Barre Pioneers, are shalcing in their tights as 
the Ninjas jog out of the concession stands, 
through two spires of fireworks, and onto 
the field. One spire prophetically fizzles 
and dies; a Ninja pauses, then stoically con-
tinues his uoc. We already know how the 
season will end: The New Haven Coliseum 
will be demolished, and the arena-less 
Ninjas will either disband or trudge to 
another post-indusuial wasteland, ped-
dling their distinctive brand of muscle-
bound pageantry to new adoring fans. 

To the uninformed, an looks more 
like rec hour at the outhouse than football. 
Grown 
men 
ram 
one another 
to 
smithereens while chasing an oblong ball 
around a half-sized, walled-and-padded, 
asu orurfed cage. There is no punting, and 
nets deflect the ball back into play after a 
field goal is missed. The best players-
including New Haven's famed Anthony 
Comer-are "sixty-minute men." 

With a $36 dollar seat and a $10 ticket, 
this is what I see: 

Despite the high scores and brutal col-
lisions, the highlights come when play 
scops. At one point, football apparel is 
lined up every five yards; two drunk, 
doughy men will suit up over their clothes 
and race for the goal line. Pete is slightly 
more coordinated. He oucdresses Adam 
and lumbers to victory. Defeated, Adam 
spots [Nun)Chuck the Ninja, the team 
mascot, on the sidelines. Adam pauses for a 
moment and then barrels shoulder-first 
into Chuck, sending him to the floor. But 
Chuck's the wrong ninja to russel with: He 
gracefully subdues the man while security 
rushes in and the crowd blows its top with 
admiration. 

Later in this same game, an angry 
player kicks the ball into the stands after 
ending the game with a futile touchdown. 
An elderly man leaps into the air. He catch-
es the ball but fumbles when he crashes 
three rows back, spilling spectators and 
beer. After a hush, someone gives him the 
ball, and he emerges with it held tri-
umphantly high. We clap respectfully. 

To rouse the crowd from its torpor, the 
Ninjas' cheerleaders, the Stan, execute sec-
ond-rate dance moves. On the sidelines 
they seem co evince the enthusiasm of un-
