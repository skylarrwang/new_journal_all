THE 
STUDENTS 
WHO 
STAYED
Yale’s campus stands empty, and 
the students who remain face a 
new, isolated reality.
BY ELLA GOLDBLUM
Antonio Cilibrizzi ’23 is reading Madame Bovary—
over and over again.
On March 12, Dean Chun sent an email to the Yale 
community asking that students leave campus “if at all 
possible.” Yalies scattered all over the globe, boarding 
flights in a hurry and leaving behind the majority of 
their belongings. Antonio, however, belongs to a group 
of students with “exceptional circumstances”—inter­
national students whose home countries are under a 
Level-3 CDC travel advisory, emancipated students, 
and others with special permission from the Yale Col­
lege Dean’s Office, roughly 200 total—who are allowed 
to remain on campus until the end of the term. 
For this group, the physical world is unchanged; they 
have remained in the same location all throughout 
the spring semester. Yet the pandemic has suspended 
campus life. These students confront challenges that 
wouldn’t have made sense two months ago, like how 
to keep in touch with quarantining families across the 
globe, or how to “social distance” when getting takeout 
meals in the Trumbull College dining hall.


The same week that Dean Chun sent students home, 
New York City began setting up field hospitals for its 
design by Natasha Gaither

SANITIZER DISPENSERS 
AWAIT USE."”
over ten thousand COVID-19 patients. Italy reported 
record death tolls on two consecutive days, and the 
number of worldwide coronavirus cases surpassed 
300,000.
Already in late March, the pandemic could be felt 
everywhere, including in New Haven, where small 
businesses shuttered and tens of thousands of residents 
filed unemployment claims in just four days. Payne 
Whitney Gym, once a space for Yale athletes and com­
munity pool goers, was converted to a temporary med­
ical facility. 
Antonio is a first-generation, low income student 
whose academic resources would be limited at home. 
He plans to return to Anzi—his small town of 1,000 in 
Italy—by early May. When he goes home, he will be 
required to self-isolate in his grandmother’s house for 
fifteen days. 
Antonio’s father works at a hospital in Italy. Anto­
nio worries about him, though he knows his dad is 
extremely cautious about the virus, “disinfecting every­
thing he touches.” Though Italian citizens are worried 
about hospital overcrowding, Antonio says, he feels 
more concerned in the United States, where people 
are denied testing and healthcare altogether. “I have a 
lot of reservations about this country as a whole, and its 
systems,” he says. “I think healthcare is an unalienable 
right.”
He also wishes Yale would use its gargantuan endow­
ment to assist students during the pandemic. Approx­
imately one in five Yale College first-years and soph­
omores qualify for a Federal Pell Grant, and families 
on full financial aid operate on the assumption that 
their college students will receive University-sponsored 
food and housing. Even for students who can safely 
go home without endangering their health, these con­
cerns remain. 


Twice a day, Antonio traverses the empty campus 
to pick up Smart Meals in Trumbull, which consist of 
non-perishable foods in brown paper bags. He describes 
the meals as “unhealthy” and “a little sad.”
In Trumbull, the only dining hall still open, the din­
ing hall workers wear masks, and most of the students 
do, too. On the ground, yellow caution tape marks 
every six feet, and hand sanitizer dispensers await use 
after students swipe into the dining hall. Students are 
not allowed to exit the same way they came in; they 
do U-turns through a passage of rearranged tables and 
chairs to avoid physical contact. 
“It’s hard to get used to it because you don’t stand 
there and talk to people, you just kind of swipe in and 
keep walking, six feet behind the people in front of 
you,” says Nicholas Ruiz-Huidobro Magdits ’21, who 
stayed on campus after a shortened spring break trip in 
order to protect his immunocompromised father and 
sister in Virginia. “There’s one dining hall worker, Leo, 
who always talks to me, so it’s nice to still have some 
human interaction.”
Recently, Nicholas and another friend studied for a 
class in the Trumbull courtyard’s lawn chairs together, 
six feet apart—a welcome departure from his relent­
less daily routine. He says it’s important to take a break 
from staring at the wall. Other times, solitude prevails. 
All residential college common spaces have closed, 
and Yalies on campus are not allowed to let other stu­
dents into their colleges. 
“I ran into somebody I knew a few days ago, and she 
stopped and said hi, but there wasn’t really much to say, 
so we just kept walking,” says Nicholas. 
In downtown New Haven, people are still taking 
daily strolls to pick up delivery from restaurants, cross­
ing to the other side of the street to avoid one another. 
The same group of four-wheelers drives down Elm 
Street at late hours, and when Nicholas tries to sleep, 
he hears the usual sirens of ambulances. He compares 
the everyday quarantine atmosphere to that of an aver­
age Sunday morning in the Elm City: hushed, but still 
alive.
“New Haven doesn’t die and become a ghost town 
when Yale students leave,” he says. “The only differ­
ence is that Wednesday and Saturday nights are a little 
quieter on York Street.”
Outside Nicholas’ window, he can see a beautiful 
view of Broadway and Elm Street. For a second, it is 
almost normal. “What surprises me is how easy it is 
to just kind of forget that anything’s happening, if you 
don’t look at the news,” he says. 
When he walks outside his bedroom, though, he can 
no longer hear the sound of video games from the dorm 
across the hall, and he remembers all that has changed. 


Valerie Nguyen ’22, another student who stayed on 
campus, is keeping herself occupied inside: composing 
music, drawing, and taking on “home improvement” 
projects in her Pierson College suite, where she’s

RIGHT NOW IS VERY 
EXISTENTIAL. EVERYBODY 
HAS TO WORRY ABOUT 
THEIR SURVIVAL."” 
accompanied by one of her suitemates. 
“I’m at least half an introvert,” she says. “So I’ve 
always had stuff to do.” 
Valerie’s entire family is across the globe in Hanoi, 
Vietnam. She’s concerned about her parents in Hanoi, 
but they’re much more worried about their daughter in 
New Haven.
“I just assumed that Yale would take care of me, and 
that I’m more safe here than anywhere else I could be,” 
she says. “But people back home were really worried 
about me, because New York is a shit show right now.”
In New Haven, Valerie witnesses colossal change. 
She rides her bike to Cross Campus and to Benjamin 
Franklin and Pauli Murray Colleges, and sees how 
empty they are. She never forgets to bring a mask with 
her, and in the supermarket, she has started wearing 
gloves. She has some friends from the international 
student community still on campus, but she can’t see 
them. It is hard and strange to be alone together.
Valerie is especially saddened by the emptiness of 
Cross Campus and the closing of beloved local busi­
nesses. The bubble tea shops were the first to go: Vivi’s, 
T-Swirl, and The Whale Tea. The majority of shops on 
Chapel Street and Whitney Avenue have shut down. 
Valerie had already planned to be on campus through 
the summer doing psychology research in a lab in New 
Haven. She holds out hope it will happen, but is brac­
ing for the possibility of cancellation. She had also 
planned to return to Vietnam to visit family and renew 
her student visa, which must be done annually. 
But as of Thursday, March 19, the U.S. Embassy and 
Consulate in Vietnam cancelled routine immigrant 
and nonimmigrant visa appointments. The next Friday, 
they announced that they were no longer accepting 
applications for visa renewal by mail for nonimmigrant 
visas, saying that they will “resume visa service as soon 
as possible.” Valerie says this new policy will not affect 
her as long as she doesn’t leave the United States, and 
her I-20—Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant 
Student Status—remains valid.
Acutely aware of the hardships low-income and inter­
national students face right now, Valerie joined the stu­
dent advocacy group in support of a universal grading 
policy for spring 2020. Even though she’s living in Pier­
son College, Valerie—a Statistics & Data Science and 
Cognitive Science double major—struggles to concen­
trate on Zoom lectures and seminars. But if she had 
gone back home, “healthcare access would’ve been 
shit,” she would have been forced to attend classes in 
the middle of the night, and she wouldn’t have had an 
internet connection for at least half a month.
“A lot of what we were advocating for was for the 
most affected demographic,” she says, and pauses. 
“And I guess I count.”
Yale’s decision to send students home invited discus­
sions about the physical university’s role in ensuring 
student well-being. Even beyond concerns about food 
security and housing, students who rely on Yale’s cam­
pus for services like therapy, students whose families do 
not accept their gender or sexuality identity, and stu­
dents who come from abusive homes, felt that they had 
been stranded without resources. 
“The one thing I kept thinking about was that there 
were other students who were very affected who could 
have benefited from staying, but they really couldn’t,” 
Valerie says, adding that the petition process for remain­
ing on campus could have been more transparent. In a 
March 12 email, Chun said he planned to work closely 
with residential college heads and deans to determine 
which students need to stay. But Neche Veyssal, former 
co-president of First-Generation Low-Income at Yale, 
told CNBC that she spoke to many students who were 
forced to move into friends’ off-campus apartments in 
New Haven when their requests to stay at Yale were 
denied.
“The way we’re feeling right now is very existential,” 
says Valerie. “Everybody has to worry about their sur­
vival. But I wish the administration was a little more 
decisive.”
Antonio, too, finds it harder to concentrate on aca­
demics amid mental health struggles, fears for his fam­
ily, and forays into the news. 
“I understand that it’s not a priority these days,” he 
says. “Even if we try to make it a priority, I think we 
would still struggle so much. It’s not just about socio­
economic factors, but also mental effects of quaran­
tine.”
Yet Antonio enjoys being alone. He does yoga by him­
self and laughs at his own jokes. He reads a lot—books 
matter a great deal to him—and has been returning to 
the lessons of Gustave Flaubert’s Madame Bovary. He 
says the book reminds him how to cope when reality 
does not match up with his ideals, a prescient lesson 
during quarantine.
