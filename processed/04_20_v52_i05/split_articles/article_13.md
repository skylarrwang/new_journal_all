EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Alannah Maynez ’20 wakes up at 8:30 a.m. in 
Portland, Oregon and makes herself a cup of cof­
fee before she Zooms into her English seminar. 
The seminar has felt off ever since the pandemic 
started—–her professor has stopped implement­
ing class plans, and students have started plan­
ning the lessons, instead. Alannah is three hours 
behind her professors in New Haven, so her 
daily schedule has shifted significantly earlier. 
She Zooms into a psychology seminar at 10:30 
a.m., then “Drugs and Brain Behavior” at 1:00 
p.m.. When her classes are over around 2:30, she 
laces up her sneakers and goes for a run. In the 
afternoon, she hangs out with her brother, cooks 
dinner, and FaceTimes with friends on the other 
coast. Around 9:00 p.m., her mom comes home 
from her shift as a nurse practitioner, where she 
has spent the day treating immunocompromised 
and elderly patients, many of whom are sick with 
COVID-19. Ten people have died of the virus in 
one of the facilities she serves. Alannah stays up to 
chat with her mom about her day before going to 
bed. She says, “When I was at school all I would 
do is study. Now I don’t study that much. There’s 
just a lot of stuff going on at home.”


A few hours after Alannah, in a different time 
zone, Abey Philip wakes up in Louisville, Ken­
tucky. His mother, also a nurse, returns home at 
8:30 a.m. from her night shift at Baptist Health, 
the same night shift she’s been working for six­
teen years. She works on an all-COVID floor 
now. The hospital only allows her to check out 
two face masks for each twelve-hour shift, a rule 
that leaves her without necessary protection for 
much of her time at the hospital. In the morning, 
Abey does some homework, says hi to his mom, 
and then Zooms into L3 Spanish at 10:30 a.m.. 
Afterwards, he cooks himself some lunch, and 
spends the afternoon doing schoolwork. Then, 
he laces up his shoes and heads for the park he’s 
been visiting since childhood. His mom leaves 
for the hospital again around 6:10 p.m., and Abey 
settles down for the night to finish his homework. 
The night before we talked, he’d stayed up until 
midnight to turn in a paper due the next day. “But 
if push comes to shove, and I sat down and talked 
to my mom and grandparents and we were about 
to watch a Bollywood movie, I would skip a semi­
nar. In a heartbeat,” he says. “At this point, when 
everyone is so stressed, the times we can spend 
together as a community and as a family are really 
important.” 


Alannah and Abey are worrying about the same 
things: their mothers, who are both working as 
nurses, and their grandparents and siblings, who 
they take care of at home. Both of them told me 
they’re most worried about those who are more 
vulnerable right now. Alannah worries about the 
workers who are on temporary contracts and don’t 
have paid time off, like some dining hall workers 
and facilities staff. Abey worries about students, 
specifically those from rural areas and first gener­
ation or low-income backgrounds, who are navi­
gating financial uncertainty and other barriers to 
online classes, like issues with internet access. 
They’re both coping with life during a global 
pandemic. And yet, they’ve found themselves on 
opposite sides of a divisive issue—how they should 
be graded on schoolwork during this crisis. Lurk­
ing within this question, another, quieter debate 
has emerged around grades themselves: what do 
grades measure? And do they reflect our achieve­
ments equally, even when we’re on campus? 
On April 7, Dean Marvin Chun announced 
that all Yale College classes would be graded on 
a Pass/Fail basis for the spring semester of 2020. 
His announcement arrived after three weeks of 
contentious debate, throughout which students’ 
concerns unfolded into a full-fledged movement 
called No Fail Yale. Abey was one of the organiz­
ers of this movement, which advocated for a Uni­
versal Pass grading policy. Under Universal Pass, 
all Yale students would earn a grade of “P” on 
their Spring 2020 transcripts. Dean Chun thinks 
that this is the only equitable way to move for­
ward, given the diversity of issues that students are 
facing at home.


Alannah doesn’t agree. She’s concerned that 
the movement misrepresented the interests of 
marginalized communities and feels disappointed 
that students are spending so much time talking 
about grades. “This is literally a debate over, like, 
marks on a transcript,” she said. Instead of the 
debate around Universal Pass, she wishes students 
were spending more time pushing Yale to support 
the other members of our community—casual 
workers especially—who have been impacted by 
the pandemic. 


The No Fail Yale movement emerged from 
inequities within the student body that arose in 
the wake of COVID-19. Organizers acknowl­
edged that students have different kinds of access 
to resources like Wi-Fi, free time, and quiet study 
spaces wherever they’re sheltering-in-place, and 
that these differences impact students’ focus on 
schoolwork––and, ultimately, their grades. Their 
goal was to ensure that no Yalies are penalized 
academically for circumstances beyond their con­
trol when they’re home. But students’ removal 
from Yale calls into question the differences in 
resources that have existed on campus all along. 
No Fail Yale encourages us to ask: have grades 
ever evaluated us equitably?


Central to that question is another one of equal 
importance: what is a grade, really? The first 
recorded grades in the United States were given 
out at Yale, in the form of a diary entry by Ezra 
Stiles, the seventh president of Yale College. 
He evaluated the fifty-eight seniors graduating 
in the class of 1785, recording “Twenty Optimi, 
sixteen second Optimi, twelve Inferiores (Boni), 
ten Perjores,” based on public and private displays 
of knowledge. For Stiles, grading was a personal 
practice—a record of his interpretation of how 
well students were displaying what they learned 
on campus. This impulse to rank students against 
one another based on their demonstration of 
knowledge remained salient, though grading sys­
tems varied widely among universities for the next 
two centuries. Yale changed grading systems four 
times between 1967 and 1981, cycling through a 
numerical system, an Honors/High Pass system, 
and an A-F system before settling on the A-F sys­
tem with pluses and minuses in use today. 


This pandemic is not unique in having the 
power to shift systems of grading.  In the late 
nineteen-sixties, when students removed from 
Yale due to academic failure became eligible for 
drafting into the Vietnam War, one Yale professor 
simply gave all of his students A’s. In the spring of 
1970, during the New Haven Black Panther tri­
als, students decided to strike, and held late-night 
meetings in their residential colleges to ask fac­
ulty and administration to do the same. Nine of 
twelve residential colleges decided to shut down 
academically and voted to open their doors to 
those who arrived from out of town to attend the 
trials. After the vote, a large majority of Yale stu­
dents stopped going to class and instead trained 
as marshals, attended teach-ins, and directed their 
energy towards the trials. In a meeting convened 
by Yale’s president Kingman Brewster, faculty 
voted that normal academic expectations, includ­
ing classes, would be suspended for the duration 
of the trials. 


In the spring of 1970, students convened across 
New Haven to organize a halting of business-as-
usual on campus. In the spring of 2020, students 
from all over the world convened on Twitter time­
lines, Instagram stories, and Facebook profile pic­
tures to do the same thing. No Fail Yale drew wide 
support from students, cultural houses, professors, 
and the Yale College Council, or YCC. Due to 
students’ social distancing and migration off cam­
pus, the movement was held exclusively online, 
without any marches or sit-ins. The reliance on 
social media as a tool for organizing opened up 
conflict particular to the internet—conflicts that 
became biting, then personal. Isaiah Schrader, a 
junior, wrote a 179-word Facebook post about why 
he disagreed with the movement around Univer­
sal Pass. The post received 196 comments, many 
of which were from students who vehemently dis­
agreed with him. “We are in the midst of a fuck­
ing catastrophe,” wrote one commenter to Isaiah. 
Isaiah worried that law schools and medical 
schools would not approach the lack of grades 
with compassion. In his opinion, more choice, 
not less, would provide students in tough situa­
tions with better options. He also mentioned that 
a Universal Pass system would not represent the 
interests of all first generation, low-income, or 
FGLI students––even though some of these stu­
dents have become the core of the No Fail Yale 
movement.


Alannah, who identifies as a low-income stu­
dent, said, “I feel like the entire movement is 
trying to capitalize on the suffering of marginal­
ized communities in order to derive some self-in­
terested gain. And, like, this is a group of priv­
ileged Yalies.” Her concerns arose mainly from 
the way the movement has used the rhetoric of 
“marginalized students,” and the way that other 
vulnerable people—like workers at Yale who 
aren’t in unions—have been forgotten within that 
language.  “This whole conversation is not about 
the most vulnerable in our community. We forgot 
about them a month ago. We erased them,” she 
said. “I don’t know how anyone would feel that 
the best way to help marginalized groups during 
this situation would be to, like, inundate our 
administration’s and faculty’s inboxes with emails 
about grades.” 


Joe Peck ’21, a student from England, also did 
not support Universal Pass for reasons tied to his 
experience as a FGLI and international student. 
“FGLI students generally do better as they go 
through Yale,” Joe said. “I think a lot of students 
are very prepared when they come here, they 
come from nicer schools and they’re able to fit in 
very well. But it’s been true that my first semes­
ter here was my worst, and every single semester 
I’ve been here I’ve improved my GPA.” When Joe 
is at Yale, he works sixteen hours every week to 
fulfill his student income contribution. Now, for 
the first time ever, he doesn’t have to work those 
long shifts anymore, because Yale has committed 
to paying student workers their salaries even if 
they’re unable to work remotely. With this new­
found time, he can focus on school without pull­
ing all-nighters, as he often does on campus. 


Some of Joe’s friends accused him of being self­
ish for his stance. “It’s very frustrating for me for a 
number of reasons. I never heard that throughout 
the year—no one ever said, ‘Oh, those kids who 
aren’t working sixteen hours a week, they’re being 
selfish.’ There was no solidarity there. Suddenly 
I’m doing well, despite everything I’ve had to go 
through. And now I’m the selfish one,” he said.


Joe’s concern—that life at Yale has always been 
inequitable—is one that the organizers of No 
Fail Yale anticipated. On their “Frequently Asked 
Questions” document, one of the questions is, 
“Yale was unfair anyways. Why should this change 
now?” The organizers respond, “We should strive 
to be the change we want to see. There is no rea­
son to confine our expectations of the institutions 
we love to what the world has tried to force us to 
accept as reasonable and just.”
