are. I think that was [how] both of them got through 
this ordeal,” said Steve. 


Sujitno is thin and sturdy, but was approaching sev­
enty when he entered sanctuary. The team worried 
that if he had a medical emergency and the team were 
forced to call an ambulance, he might end up arrested 
by ICE on the way to or at the hospital, as had hap­
pened to a ten-year-old girl in Texas. So they set about 
searching for a sanctuary doctor. When Sujitno needed 
eyeglasses, an optician came into the church to do the 
eye test and provide prescription glasses.

There were other moments of fear while Sujitno was 
in sanctuary. In March 2018, letters declaring April 3 
to be “Punish a Muslim Day” were anonymously sent 
to families, lawmakers, and businesses in the United 
Kingdom. The handout listed a cruel point system 
that rewarded attackers with points for committing 
hate crimes: verbally abusing a Muslim would grant 
10 points while torturing one with “electrocution, 
skinning, use of rack” would give them 250. Nancy 
called the Meriden police and spoke to a desk ser­
geant. She told them about the letters and explained 
that they had a Muslim couple in sanctuary at their 
church. “We would just appreciate a police presence,” 
she said. On Tuesday, April 3, the Meriden police sat 
in the parking lot of the church all day, keeping watch 
for potential attacks. “I was really really pleased. They 
really responded,” Nancy said. Thankfully, nothing 
happened. 

During their time in sanctuary, Sujitno and Dahlia 
became fearful that someone was watching them. 
“They were really somewhat traumatized whenever 
there was a fire engine that went by or a police car, 
flashing lights or something,” Steve said. “They would 
keep everything dark inside the church and look 
through the windows to see what was happening in the 
dark hours. Sujitno never so much as put a toe out­
doors, the entire time, nothing.”

ICE never paid the couple a visit during the 599 days 
they were in sanctuary, but they had clamped a bulky 
GPS monitor to Sujitno’s ankle. The officials monitor­
ing the ankle bracelet called at odd hours to check in 
on him, often early in the morning. “It seemed to me 
to be a form of harassment more than anything else,” 
said Steve. 

Recalling this experience in his apartment months 
later, Sujitno showed me sheets and sheets of yellow 
legal paper stapled together—this was his log, which 
he used to do calculations and keep track of when he 
charged the battery, and the time he expected the bat­
tery to run out. If the monitor ran out of battery, the 
officials would call him. Sujitno organized his pray­
ing, visits from his friends, and his meals around the 
ever-present ankle monitor. 


For most of his time in sanctuary, Sujitno Sajuti had 
an application for a U-Visa pending approval by U.S. 
Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS. A 
U-Visa is a special form of status reserved for victims 
of certain crimes in the U.S. who have suffered sub­
stantial abuse, physical or mental. These victims must 
prove that they cooperated with law enforcement in 
the investigation or prosecution of the crime. His law­
yer, Diana Blank, saw it as his ticket to remain in the 
U.S., legally.

Shortly after Diana heard of Sujitno’s case in late 
2018, Alok Bhatt, a coordinator for the Connecticut 
Immigrant Rights Alliance who had supported Sujitno 
since he entered sanctuary, raised the possibility to her 
that Sujitno might be eligible for a U-Visa, since he 
had been a victim of armed robbery in 1995. Diana, a 
staff attorney at the non-profit organization New Haven 
Legal Assistance, immediately got to work with her legal 
team at the Yale Law School Immigrant Rights Clinic. 
They filed for a motion to reopen Sujitno’s deportation 
proceedings and vacate the order of removal on the 
basis of the U-Visa application. The team then applied 
for a U-Visa on Sujitno’s behalf in February 2018. The 
process took over a year and hours of work by his legal 
team, who are working on his case pro bono.

Finally, in May 2019, USCIS granted Sujitno 
deferred action, a protective status stating that Sujitno 
would no longer be a priority for removal proceed­
ings because he was deemed prima facie eligible for 
a U-Visa. The evidence was strongly in his favour. 
USCIS had issued a statement saying that the only rea­
son he was not being granted the U-Visa immediately 
was that Congress had set a cap of ten thousand on the 
number of visas that could be granted each year. The 


queue was several years long.

Nancy was at a faculty meeting at the Yale School 
of Nursing when she received a message from Diana 
Blank. “Please call me as soon as you can,” Diana said. 
“When you get that kind of message you assume it’s 
bad news,” Nancy recalled. She called Diana, who told 
her of the judge’s decision. At last, Sujitno was no lon­
ger at risk of imminent deportation. 

“It felt wonderful to know that you actually can make 
a difference,” said Nancy. “You know that old Marga­
ret Mead saying, that all you need is a small group of 
dedicated, committed people to really make change? 
It felt like we did.”

The last day of May 2019 was the warmest day of 
the week, and also the day Sujitno Sajuti would take 
his first steps outside the white farmhouse in which he 
had taken sanctuary for the past 599 days. He put on a 
black kufi, white shirt and grey jacket. Dahlia, with her 
penchant for wearing beautiful clothing, wore a bright 
green hijab and a matching embroidered baju kurung 
printed with flowers. She held the door open for him 
as he stepped into the sunshine. 

His first stop was an ICE office, where he would be 
unshackled from the ankle monitor he had worn since 
October 2017. From there, he would go home. 

For Steve, the moment when Sujitno left sanctuary 
was bittersweet. The couple had become such a fixture 
in the daily lives and thoughts of the sanctuary team 
members. They had shared many dinners and conver­
sations during late nights in the farmhouse. “We were 
losing him and he was losing us,” he said. Now, Steve 
doesn’t see Sujitno very often. But sometimes, when 
Sujitno needs a ride to the Hartford train station, he 
gives Steve a call. 

Nine months later, on a Friday morning a week after 
I first met him in the Hartford Mosque, Sujitno Sajuti 
and his wife are doing laundry in their white-carpeted 
apartment in West Hartford. The aroma of frying oil 
wafts from the kitchen, where Dahlia is cooking. In 
a spacious corner of the living room, a prayer mat is 
unfurled, facing mecca. A Koran sits on his crowded 
bookshelf. 

The journey of Sujitno and other people like him 
to gain legal protection and recognition continues. In 
his state of the union speech earlier that month, Don­
ald Trump reaffirmed his desire to restrict immigration 
into the country, declaring that “[t]he United States of 
America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Ameri­
cans, not criminal aliens.” Sujitno, with his neat attire, 
staunch devotion to prayer, and measured manner, 
ought to meet even President Trump’s test of being a 
law-abiding American, if that test should matter at all.

I ask Sujitno what he would say to President Trump 
if he had the chance. He responded, “Trump’s wife is 
from another country. His father-in-law is from another 
country. Why should they become citizens?” he said. 
“It hurts me.”

There will be more court appearances and rallies to 
attend. The Meriden church will carry on with orga­
nizing pro-immigrant events. Activists and lawyers like 
Steve and Diana will charge forward in their cease­
less efforts so that Sujitno and Dahlia, and others like 
them, can continue to enjoy peaceful Friday morn­
ings, making breakfast in their own home, which is a 
right that has been twisted into a privilege. On this 
day, Sujitno is preparing to catch a train, and Dahlia 
is making a delicious meal, dressed in a vibrant green 
hijab embroidered with pearl-like beads. Before I 
leave, he tells me he has been living in this apartment 
for a long time, more than twenty years. I pray that he 
will have twenty more.
