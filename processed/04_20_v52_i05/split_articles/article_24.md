**Title: SHELTERING WITHOUT PLACE**
**Author: Rachel Calcott**
**Page number(s): 23-24**

The only people one expects to see on the streets of 
New Haven this spring are masked figures shoulder­
ing grocery bags or hurrying to work in uniform, and 
the occasional spandex-clad jogger. But despite orders 
to shelter in place, at noon on April 7, Beatrice Codi­
anni, age seventy-one, walked the streets of Fair Haven 
handing out face masks to those who can’t source them 
elsewhere: the members of the Sex Workers and Allies 
Network, or SWAN.
Codianni’s red hair falls around a face whose upper 
half is taken up by a pair of thick-framed glasses, the 
lower half dominated by a wide smile. Codianni, who 
founded SWAN in 2016, has been working with sur­
vival sex workers for thirteen years. “We hand out sup­
plies, we do street based outreach. We have no fixed 
office site or anything like that,” she told me over the 
phone. Street sex work is often undertaken as a last 
resort, to support a drug addiction or as a response to 
an untenable home situation. SWAN has found that for 
the majority of survival sex workers, the alternative to 
finding a date is spending the night on the streets. Each 
week, as the rest of the nation isolates behind closed 
doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Codianni and 
her team load up on an assortment of toiletries, sex pro­
tection gear, and face masks, and head out to find their 
members on the streets.
In the last week of March, Connecticut Governor 
Ned Lamont issued an executive order: “Stay home; 
stay safe.” As New Haven approaches one thousand 
coronavirus cases, residents who can are sheltering 
in place. For sex workers still sleeping on the street, 
the consequences of being unable to find shelter this 
spring could be fatal; on the same day that Codianni 
went back out to Fair Haven’s sidewalks to distribute 
face masks, news headlines read that one in three of 
Boston’s homeless had contracted the virus. While 
COVID-19 is a threat to anyone unable to isolate, for 
survival sex workers, it has the added effect of com­
pounding issues of homelessness, discrimination, and 
pre-existing poor access to medical care. 
SWAN’s philosophy centers around harm reduction 
and prioritizes leadership by those who have expe­
rience in sex work. “Our motto is ‘Nothing about us 
without us,’” said Chloe Andree, a member of SWAN’s 
outreach team. Before the pandemic, SWAN provided 
a variety of services for survival sex workers—from 
self-defense and sexual health classes to ‘know your 
rights’ workshops and trauma informed therapy. But in 
the current moment, SWAN’s focus has narrowed to 
the daily struggle of keeping its members alive.
The formidable heart of the SWAN operation, Codi­
anni is a New Haven local and activist whose work has 
revolved around tackling issues of sexism and margin­
alization. “I’ve been an activist for decades,” Codianni 
told me. “I was part of the first women’s liberation 
center right here in New Haven… then the anti-war 
movement… and civil rights.” But in her early forties, 
Codianni’s interest in community activism led her to 
join the local board of directors of the world’s largest 
hispanic street gang, the Latin Kings. By the early 
1990s, when gang turf battles directed the attention of 
the FBI to the streets of New Haven, Codianni was on 
the gang’s Board of Directors.
“I was concerned about some of the kids in my neigh­
borhood who are Latin Kings… three of them commit­
ted suicide,” Codianni explained to me. She wanted to 
act as a liaison between the gang and the community, 
so she called up the gang’s Vice President. “He said, 
‘look, if you joined, they’d have to listen to you and you 
could get further if you were a member.’ So I joined.”
In 1994, Codianni landed in Danbury jail on charges 
of racketeering, and spent 15 years behind bars. “I’m 
part of the real women of Orange is the New Black. 
[The series] is a load of bullshit,” Codianni laughed. 
After nearly two decades of incarceration, Codianni 
returned to her native Fair Haven. She moved in with 
her son and tried to recover the threads of a normal life, 
maneuvering around the loss of her thirties and forties.
But in November 2016, Codianni had just walked 
into a City Hall meeting when she looked down at her 
phone to see the faces, names, and ages of 14 sex work­
ers splashed across local news feeds. They had been 
arrested in a sting operation. Codianni herself had 
engaged in survival sex work before her Latin King days 
to support a drug addiction. Aware of how the police’s 
disregard for the women’s privacy would shatter and 
endanger their personal lives, Codianni began advocat­
ing for the rights of sex workers. “I was in the closet 
and I said, it’s time to come out of the closet and make 
some noise.” 
Codianni went straight to the Chief of Police. “I 
talked about the collateral consequences of doing 
stings. You’re never going to arrest away sex work,” she 
argues. Following a public demonstration at City Hall 
decrying the stings, the New Haven police released a 
statement calling off future sting operations. But Codi­
anni knew more needed to be done to support New 
Haven’s survival sex workers.
Today, SWAN works with around 70 core mem­
bers who engage in its programming, and reaches an 
overall ‘caseload’ of 125 individuals—the majority of 
whom are houseless. “When we formed SWAN we got 
together and said, what do we want to do? How are we 
going to work?”  Codianni’s decision was informed by 
her own history of survival sex work, and her first-hand 
knowledge of the discrimination that these women 
face. “Some people want to form a sex workers union, 
but I said we have to go after the most vulnerable pop­
ulation. And that’s people doing survivor or street sex 
work.” 
In a pandemic, many face financial struggles—but 
survival sex workers are finding that all avenues to mak­
ing a living have been cut off. “They’re not getting dates 
with the same frequency that they were able to before, 
which was still not enough to make anywhere near a 
livable wage,” explained Evan Serio, a volunteer with 
the New Haven medical core and member of SWAN. 
The Connecticut state government’s reluctance to rec­
ognize sex work as a non-criminal avenue of employ­
ment has meant that sex workers find themselves ineli­
gible for unemployment benefits and unable to access 
community relief funds without a functioning bank 
account. So the members of SWAN are pursuing the 
only options remaining to them. “They’re going to find 
[work] any way they can, and folks have to do riskier 
and riskier things… we’re seeing all these kinds of tan­
gential terrible realities that have nothing to do with 
COVID-19 directly.” 
Sleeping on the street for nights on end can have 
dire health consequences. Feet swell under the com-
