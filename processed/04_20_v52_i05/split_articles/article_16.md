EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
As a Chinese student, he began to notice racist 
behaviour on the rise in the U.S. His friend from 
Shanghai told him that on the subway in Boston, a 
stranger began yelling at him to go back to China 
and to stop eating cats. “In America, it’s treated not 
only as a health problem but also a foreign attack,” 
Matt said. “Some people really do seem to think 
that Chinese people caused this.” He has begun 
to feel less at home in the U.S., less welcome and 
less safe in this country. “It made me miss being in 
China and made me miss that community of peo­
ple who knew what it means to have yellow skin,” 
said Matt. 

He has been trying to manage the stress of liv­
ing alone. He and his friends on campus have 
been practicing social distancing, and for him, that 
means near-complete social isolation. “A weird 
sense of hollowness sneaks up on you,” he said, “but 
for me it’s not like other people where it’s imme­
diate soul-crushing loneliness or boredom.” His 
mom wishes to visit him, but the travel from Mich­
igan to Yale would be too risky, especially because 
his elderly grandmother is staying with her.

On March 28, Matt was relocated to another col­
lege to make room for first responders dealing with 
the outbreak in New Haven. When I asked him 
where he would call home, he paused for a long 
time. “I think it doesn’t exist right now,” he said. 
“Because I feel like home is one of those things 
that only appears when you have a certain set of 
conditions met. It has to be a familiar space. It has 
to be a comfortable space. It has to have people you 
know and love and care about. There is no place 
that would feel like home if I was there right now.”

For Michelle ’22, whose last name has been 
omitted to protect her privacy, Yale is home. When 
the school told students to return home for the rest 
of the semester, she knew she wanted to stay.

Growing up in a sunny California suburb, 
Michelle had what she now describes as a difficult 
upbringing. In her parents’ house, studies always 
took precedence over socializing or play. They car­
ried with them a mindset forged by a childhood 
of poverty in China, forcing the children to finish 
every last scrap of two-day-old food waste, even if 
it was growing sour. And they didn’t shy from the 
use of a ruler or stick for discipline. “If it got leaked 
what was happening to me at home, I’d probably 
end up in foster care,” said Michelle. When she 
came home from school, it was always to an empty 
house. “I felt I really had to raise myself,” she said. 
“I feel bad for saying this, but the strongest ties to 
my house are almost purely financial.”

When she arrived at Yale in 2018, she instantly 
felt at home. Two-hundred-year-old Elm trees grew 
on Old Campus, elegant neo-gothic spires rose 
toward a bluebird sky, the stained glass windows 
glimmered in the sunlight. After being pressured 
by her parents to be pre-med in her first-year, she 
met peers that inspired her to pursue her interests. 
“I feel super liberated being here,” she said. She is 
now a Computing and the Arts major. She knew 
that it would be better for her mental health and 
happiness than if she were to return home to the 
Bay Area. “I see New Haven as more of the place 
that has brought me up in the correct sense.”


For fifty hours, I am in transit. At Mexico City 
International Airport, I try in broken English, using 
hand gestures, to ask a big-bellied man where I can 
find the airport shuttle to Terminal 1, where my 
flight out of Mexico would leave at 5:25 a.m. He 
does not understand me and points in some dis­
tant direction. Vision blurry, face hot, back aching, 
I wander the terminal where travelers snooze on 
metal chairs. Then, I see the words “sleeping cap­
sules” shimmering in the empty airport bay like a 
mirage. 

The woman at the counter of the small cap­
sule hotel pretends not to notice that I talk to her 
through tears. She gives me clean socks and leads 
me down a long, lightless hall where sleeping pods 
are stacked atop one another, glowing with blue 
neon light. I swipe my access card to unlock my 
pod and see the clean sheets, the pillows, the duvet. 
As I stand under the warm shower, I feel the day’s 
stresses dissolve from my greasy skin until all that is 
left is me, a lump of soft flesh. 

Travellers drift, faces covered by foam masks 
and hands rubbery with disposable gloves. There 
are old women being ferried to the gates in wheel­
chairs and small children being carried in their 
parent’s arms. It seems too normal. I wonder if they 
are going home.

I board a flight from Mexico City to Vancou­
ver. The plane is so empty that I can sleep lying 
down across all three seats in my row. I use Stephen 
King’s memoir On Writing as my pillow. The plane 
touches down over the desolate Canadian land­
scape and I see craggy, snow-capped mountains. 
For a moment, I am transported out of this human 
drama into the eternal world of stones, mountains, 
and the sky. They existed long before us and will 
certainly outlive us.

In Vancouver, the airport is emptier than usual 
and you can feel it. Canada had shut its borders 
to non-essential travel by foreign nationals. Only 
two staffers tend to the passengers making interna­
tional connections. When I sneeze into my sleeve, 
a short-haired Caucasian woman shoots a dirty look 
at me. She ushers her daughter along, distancing 
herself. 

As I watch two boys play football over an empty 
row of chairs, I call Sara, whose name has been 
changed to protect her privacy, to talk about her 
experience. 


Sara ’21 was sightseeing with her friend in 
Seville, Spain, when she received word that the 
Trump administration was considering a travel ban 
in Europe; she needed to book the nearest plane 
ticket back. 

Ticket prices had risen to as much as $18,000 for 
a one-way ticket from Madrid to JFK Airport, but 
she managed to book a one-way flight to London, 
and then a seat from there to New York. 

She calls me from Chicago, where she’s staying 
at a friend’s apartment indefinitely. She is from 
a CDC Level 3 Country and did not consider 
returning home. If she flies back, the U.S. might 
implement travel restrictions that would prevent 
her from returning to New York for her summer 
internship in finance. Without this internship, she 
will lose her chance at getting a full-time job offer. 
“My family is very worried about me, but I don’t 
think they necessarily want me back because they 
know how much my job means to me,” Sara said. 
Although she is a foreign student, a “non-resident 
alien”, in the United States, and like me, cannot 
call it her home, it is home to her ambitions, her 
dreams, her future.

“I think the impact on international students is 
present in a way that isn’t always recognised,” Matt 
said. 

The sense of displacement, Matt explained, 
accompanying isolation from one’s family, can be 
dangerous for the mental health of these students. 
Now, he is passing time by writing poems. In one, 
he asks, “Homecoming, coming not. / Who knew 
celebrations stopped for breath?”


Boarding the plane from Vancouver to Tokyo, I 
see dozens of Japanese students returning home. 
False eyelashes and fair skin peek out from beneath 
their face masks. I can tell it is a flight full of Japa­
nese students because hardly anyone has put their 
seat down—they are acculturated to be consider­
ate. I feel guilty for lowering my seat as far as it 
can go; America has inflected my behaviour with 
unabashed individualism. 

From Tokyo, I fly to Singapore. The plane is less 
than a quarter full. I count only nineteen heads in 
my cabin. Soon, international flights to Singapore 
will dwindle to no more than a few a day. By then, 
I hope that my friends will all be safely sealed into 
their homes, certain they’ll have a place to wait out 
the pandemic. 

I think of how the virus is encouraging coun­
tries to put up borders and bans in the interest of 
national security. But when Vietnam stops export­
ing rice and Europe hoards medical supplies, rice 
bowls in Asia may go empty; hospitals in devel­
oping countries will suffer. I remember the first 
day of international orientation at Yale, when I 
climbed the hill to the planetarium to watch the 
solar eclipse with my new friends from Kenya and 
Malaysia, and Taiwan and Indonesia. We squinted 
at the burning orb through a pinhole camera, and I 
thought of how this coin-sized star illuminates not 
only the seven continents we call home, but our 
entire solar neighbourhood. I wonder when I will 
meet these people again. 

When I said goodbye to my best friend and travel 
partner in Mexico, arms wrapped around him, 
tears seeping into his shirt, he told me that he will 
see me back home—our real home, not the one 
where we can be barred from reentry. Yes, I say, our 
home, as if to remind myself that it is a real place. 
As the plane descends over Singapore, I see the 
narrow river of lights lining the causeway to Malay­
sia. Our closest neighbour closed her borders just 
days before. The aircraft grounded in the airport 
wink at me; they were once bound for a different 
destination. To them, Singapore is just a port of 
transit. To me, it’s my only home.
