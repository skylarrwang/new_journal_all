By signing the order, he had committed himself to 
leaving the country by February 6, 2004. When he did 
not do so, his voluntary departure order was converted 
into a deportation removal order. This was the removal 
order that ICE acted upon when they threatened him 
with deportation in October 2017.
“It should be understood that this man was placed in 
removal proceedings because he voluntarily complied 
in 2003 with the US government’s rather shockingly 
Islamophobic special registration,” said Diana Blank, 
Sujitno’s lawyer. Today, Sujitno speaks of his decision 
to register with NSEERs with regret. “I try to follow the 
rules, but in fact, it’s not really as it is,” he said. “There 
must be something wrong.”


It was 1989 in Jakarta, Indonesia. Sujitno was work­
ing as a public health researcher and policy analyst in 
the bustling capital city. At all hours, one could hear 
the pedicab drivers tooting their horns, motorbikes 
rumbling with exhaust, and neighbourhood cats spar­
ring in territorial battles. Five times a day, the full-
throated voice of the Muslim call to prayer echoed 
through the streets, under highways, and in mosques, 
drawing the faithful out of their homes and workplaces 
to face mecca.

He lived with his wife, Dahlia, whom he had met 
at a wedding in Jakarta eight years prior. Dahlia was a 
librarian and, like him, spent most of her time in the 
library. She was studious, like Sujitno. She came from 
a strict family, like Sujitno. And neither of them had 
much experience dating. They immediately connected 
and grew close. “We told [each other how we felt] 
by our actions, it’s much better than words,” recalled 
Sujitno. “It’s not like in the films.” A year and a half 
later, they were married. 

With a Masters in Public Health from Columbia 
University, which he attended as a Fulbright Scholar, 
Sujitno enjoyed the privilege of an advanced degree in 
a country where only 2.3 percent of the population had 
a Bachelor’s degree and over half had no schooling. 
But it was not enough; his colleagues at the Jakarta 
research office asked him, “Why did you come home? 
Finish your PhD!”

In 1989, he arrived in Connecticut, a state where 
winter lasts a third of the year. It was a far cry from trop­
ical Indonesia. Eager to complete a PhD in medical 
anthropology, a small discipline at the time, Sujitno 
went to the University of Connecticut on a scholarship 
to study with one of the few medical anthropologists 
in the field. Research in medical anthropology, he 
believed, would give him a fresh angle from which to 
study public health, making him more employable. 
But before he completed his doctorate, his advisor 
took an early retirement. Without anyone to replace 
him, Sujitno couldn’t complete his doctoral degree. 
He tried in vain to find another advisor. 

I asked him if he considered returning to Jakarta at 
this point. “It’s too late, how can I go back to Indo­
nesia?” he replied. “If I go back without a PhD, I’d 
be nothing.” He believed that his supervisor at work 
would stall his career advancement if he returned. “It 
would have screwed up my career,” he said.

For the next three years, Sujitno finished his disser­
tation coursework, worked at supermarkets, and con­
tinued teaching language classes for Bahasa Indonesia. 
His student visa expired after he had to pause his stud­
ies, but he gained authorization to work in the States. 
He and Dahlia moved into an apartment in West Hart­
ford. She taught Indonesian cooking while he laid low 
until the national registration system for Muslim men 
was announced in 2003 and he came onto ICE’s radar. 
In December 2011, ICE agents arrested Sujitno at 
his apartment on the grounds of the 2004 deportation 
order against him. Under the Obama Administration, 
ICE agents were increasingly targeting undocumented 
immigrants. During the sixty-nine days that he was 
held in detention, he tried to remain positive and 
made dawah—an invitation to Islam—to his detention 
officers. He was released on 17 February 2012, having 
successfully filed for a stay of removal. For the next 
five years, he filed annually for renewals of his stay of 
removal, and they were granted each time. Then, Don­
ald Trump won the presidential election.

“When he went into sanctuary, he was working with 
authorization,” said Diana, his lawyer. “He was doing 
everything that was in his power to comply with the 
law, except returning to a country where he had no 
means of survival.”

Under the Trump administration, his stay of deporta­
tion was denied for the first time since 2011. He found 
another lawyer who had one last chance to file a stay of 
removal on 6 October 2017. It was denied. Three days 
later, he entered sanctuary. 



Overnight, the sanctuary team and its members had 
to figure out the nuts and bolts of how to sustain sanc­
tuary for their guests. They set up a Facebook page to 
advocate for Sujitno’s cause, wrote thank you notes to 
the donors, and met with the Meriden Police Chief. 
They checked whether their insurance policy would 
cover the added liability of having residents in their 
house of worship. Crucially, they learned what was 
required for ICE to enter their meeting house and pos­
sibly arrest Sujitno.

Sujitno’s situation was met with an outpouring of 
public attention and support. Unitarian Universal­
ist groups and well-wishers donated to the sanctuary 
efforts, providing Stop & Shop gift cards for Steve, who 
volunteered to buy the couple’s weekly groceries. “You 
have two scholars past normal retirement age who were 
being ejected from the country after being here for 
thirty years,” said Steve later. “The sheer unfairness of 
this really angered people and activated people.”

As the days turned into weeks, the sanctuary team’s 
efforts became routine. Every week, Steve would go to 
the church, ask the couple for their grocery list, chat 
with them for a while, and leave to buy the groceries. 
The couple ate vegetarian, and the weekly shopping 
bags would be filled with fruits and vegetables: aspar­
agus, dates, carrots, potatoes, onions, scallions, tofu, 
tempeh (if they had it), and various spices and seeds.

In time, the team purchased another fridge for 
Sujitno and Dahlia to use. Nancy’s book club spon­
sored a second trundle bed for the volunteers who slept 
in the church each night. The collective effort grew as 
other activists, Unitarian Universalists in the state, and 
members of Sujitno’s masjid, or mosque, contributed 
to the sanctuary effort. 

One Sunday soon after Sujitno arrived at the meet­
ing house, Reverend Carlsson-Bull led a sermon focus­
ing on loving your neighbour. “This isn’t an act of 
charity,” she said. “It was an act of being an ally and 
being in solidarity.”

And so they lit the chalice in the sanctuary of the 
farmhouse where they had, for many years, gathered 
each Sunday for congregation, a place that was now 
also a sanctuary for Sujitno Sajuti and Dahlia.



The symbol of the chalice has its origins in Lisbon 
during World War II, when a Unitarian Universalist 
Reverend named Charles Joy ushered Jewish, Roma, 
and gay individuals fleeing Nazi persecution to safety. 
He used a flaming chalice as a secret symbol to indi­
cate that a building was a place of sanctuary. When 
the time came for Sujitno’s sanctuary team to choose a 
name, it made complete sense that they use the symbol 
that had saved many lives half a century prior. And so 
Carlsson-Bull suggested the name “Chalice Sanctuary 
Team.” 	

Social activism and justice is written into the history 
of Unitarian Universalism. More than 177 Unitarian 
Universalist ministers and seminarians marched with 
African Americans along the fifty-four-mile highway 
from Selma to Montgomery in 1965, protesting against 
continued segregation and the disenfranchisement 
of African Americans. Of the two hundred thousand 
people who participated in the March on Washington 
for Jobs and Freedom in 1963, sixteen thousand were 
Unitarian Universalists. Early Unitarian Universal­
ists thinkers like Clarence Skinner and James Luther 
Adams espoused a vision for the faith that embraced 
liberal values, defended human rights, and fought to 
eradicate race and class-based injustices. 

The Unitarian Universalist Church of Meriden is a 
church of activists. Nancy Burton is on the board of 
the Universal Healthcare Foundation and is an advo­
cate for healthcare reform. Steve had been taking part 
in immigrant rights marches outside the federal court­
house long before Sujitno took sanctuary in the church. 
A group of 20 activists, including several church mem­
bers, filled the courthouse rows during every day of the 
2019 court appearances of Miguel Castro, an activ­
ist accused of assaulting two judicial officials. Steve 
explains that he was defending an undocumented 
child who was to be separated from their parent out­
side a courthouse. On one occasion, when the church 
members arrived, the prosecutor asked, “Is the posse 
here again?” 

“Most of us do not have deep pockets,” said Nancy. 
This is a church of midwives and school teachers, of 
factory workers and construction workers. But Nancy, 
like most of the others, was committed to upholding 
justice. Her favourite hymn, titled “We’ll Build a 
Land”, sings of captives going free. It imagines a world 
“Where justice shall roll down like waters, / And peace 
like an ever flowing stream.” 

As I listened to Nancy, I couldn’t help but wonder: if 
a small band of activists from a not-very-wealthy, work­
ing-class church were able to provide sanctuary to an 
Indonesian Muslim couple for 599 days, why couldn’t 
the United States, with its vast resources and diverse 
languages, allow the couple, who have spent thirty-one 
years building a life for themselves in this country, to 
stay? 



The mosque at Hungerford Street in Hartford is a 
handsome two-story house with a pitched roof and green 
trimmings—the sacred colour of Islam. In a large space 
where sunlight streams onto red and cream-coloured 
masjid carpet, over one hundred men gather every Fri­
day to participate in jummah, a sermon delivered in 
mosques before the Friday prayer. The small bedroom 
in the meeting house where Sujitno Sajuti spent his 
days in sanctuary at the Unitarian Universalist Church 
was to serve the same function as the mosque—a clean, 
well-lit place for prayer. On Fridays, Sujitno led the 
jummah for himself, Dahlia, and sometimes, Dahlia’s 
friends. He sang the adhan and the iqamah, the call 
to prayer, before beginning to pray. It was not an ideal 
arrangement, given that congregation is important to 
Muslims, especially during Friday prayer. But it was a 
necessary one.

In the Hartford mosque, white square tiles line the 
wudu rooms in the basement. Water flows from the 
tap as the members carry out the ablution. While 
in sanctuary, before praying and reading the Koran, 
Sujitno and Dahlia would make wudu in the kitchen 
sink on the first floor with paper towels instead. But 
when members of the church were around, they would 
retreat to their private bathroom to make wudu, unwill­
ing to invite confrontation by washing themselves in 
the kitchen sink. “Actually, it’s not okay to do wudu in 
the bathroom,” said Sujitno, explaining that the bath­
room is considered unclean, “but when you have no 
choice, it’s different.”

Sujitno and Dahlia maintain a strict adherence to 
ritual fasting. However, at the beginning of their stay in 
sanctuary, this practice caused confusion and misun­
derstanding with the sanctuary team members. “When 
I’m fasting I don’t like to have guests. We don’t want 
to be negative,” Sujitno explained. Fasting is not just 
about refraining from eating; it is also about maintain­
ing one’s spiritual focus. 

But as a result, the church members were unsure 
about when they could and could not talk to their 
guests. “There’s a lot of stuff we had to figure out as 
we went. They are Muslim, from another culture and 
another religious base,” said Nancy.

In the end, they decided to hang a small sign outside 
the couple’s bedroom door on days of fasting that read, 
“Our guests are fasting. This includes not focusing on 
material things and keeping the mind at peace. Please 
respect this tradition.”

Nancy and the team came to understand the deli­
cate balance that had to be struck between the couple’s 
needs and theirs. If they were fasting or praying, the 
team gave them space to practice their religion. Some­
times, they would hear Sujitno and Dahlia talking in 
raised voices, arguing like normal couples. Arguing 
was a normal part of life, and the team did not want to 
intrude on their privacy. Most of the time, the couple 
kept to themselves. They cooked, cleaned, and prayed.

“I have never known a more devout couple than they
