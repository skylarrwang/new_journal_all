EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
No Fail Yale focuses around the idea that we 
are on more equal footing on campus than off. 
But when I asked Abey about whether he thought 
of Yale’s campus as an egalitarian place, he said, 
“I think it’s an equalizer, but it doesn’t make 
things equal. So yes, Yale provides us with nec­
essary resources like Wi-Fi, quiet study spaces, et 
cetera. But you can plainly see at Yale that things 
aren’t equal.” 

Sarah Pitafi, another organizer of No Fail Yale, 
believes that this movement reveals the under­
lying inequalities that permeate the Yale experi­
ence. “We are finally able to make the administra­
tion collectively recognize the degree of inequity 
on campus,” Sarah said. “Students have been 
saying, ‘well, we’ve always been reliant on really 
badly paid jobs, we’ve always been struggling with 
accessibility issues, we’ve always been struggling 
with lack of access to technology.’ The list goes 
on. All of these issues have always existed. Now 
it’s a matter of them being exacerbated greatly by 
a global pandemic.” Sarah hopes that when stu­
dents return to campus, they won’t forget. She 
hopes that the pandemic has presented a moment 
to discuss inequity in all its forms—on and off 
campus. “Now the University is forced to start 
addressing the reality of students’ daily lives,” she 
said. 

Sarah notes the way that grades play into these 
realities. She questions whether grades are the 
best way to document students’ success. “You’re 
kind of held captive by this idea of your grades 
being almost like a function of who you are, of 
being a function of your success,” she said, “but 
realizing how quickly grades can be discarded 
whenever you need to focus on what matters most 
has also turned into a larger conversation about—
are grades really necessary?” With Universal Pass 
comes the realization that has been happening 
across institutions throughout the United States 
during the coronavirus crisis: people created the 
systems we live our lives by, and people can dis­
mantle them, too. 

Each day, Alannah, Abey, Isaiah, Joe, and 
Sarah are faced with a new set of numbers. Mil­
lions of total cases, worldwide. Thousands of peo­
ple dead. There are numbers that measure the 
success of their state’s responses to the pandemic; 
there are numbers that measure the likelihood 
that someone they love will die. A 20% increase 
in New York City hospitalizations with each new 
day; 4,600 patients on ventilators in New York. 
Two to six weeks for patients to recover. There are 
numbers to guide them when they go outside. Six 
feet of separation. Three hours of virus viability in 
the air. There are numbers that become routines. 
Five hours of Zoom class on Wednesday. Two 
masks for each twelve-hour shift. With Universal 
Pass, their contributions to classes won’t become 
numbers too.
