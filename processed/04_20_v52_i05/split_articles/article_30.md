**Title: That’s Why I Chose Zoom**

Behind my classmate, I can see the golden glint 
of Pierson Tower as the sunlight hits it just right. 
She’s studying in the Davenport courtyard—the 
grass a sea of emerald, the paint on the spire blin­
dingly white and her hair aglow in the sunshine. 
I almost believe that I am back at Yale––until the 
disembodied voice of another classmate interrupts 
the illusion created by her virtual background. His 
video is off; I fixate on the letter “S” that fills the 
screen in lieu of his picture. Welcome to Zoom 
University. 

Since late March, Zoom, a video-conferencing 
platform, has become an integral part of our lives. 
It has replaced many of our communal spaces, 
offering a new means of virtual connection as we 
shut down public life and isolate ourselves in order 
to fight COVID-19. Jimmy Fallon hosts celebrity 
guests over Zoom. Parents call into work from their 
dining room tables over Zoom. Friends grab bot­
tles of wine and reunite for Zoom happy hours; 
long-distance couples Netflix and Zoom. Strobe 
lights flash and bass booms as students sign in to 
Zoom dance parties and jump around their child­
hood bedrooms.  

In the realm of academics, Zoom has transformed 
how students engage with professors and with one 
another. Eric Yuan, CEO of Zoom, reported in 
early April that over ninety thousand schools across 
the world were using Zoom and that over two hun­
dred million people were using the platform daily. 
Instead of meeting in seminar rooms and lecture 
halls, students and professors are now logging into

    I CHOSE ZOOM 🎵
Congratulations, you’ve been admitted 
to Yale Virtual University Class of 202X! 

class from across the world, across time zones, 
and across backgrounds, offering new opportu­
nities for engagement but also new challenges. 
Students joke that they are now students at Zoom 
University, even designing sweatshirts and t-shirts 
to show school pride. 

Yet for all the jokes, Zoom seriously strains Yale 
students’ sense of community. To me, the Yale 
experience is defined by racing to be first-in-line 
for Pierson College’s breakfast for dinner, sharing 
Kookie Monster donuts with my friends at Donut 
Crazy, late nights dancing and laughing at the 
local nightclub Toads, and collective suffering in 
Bass Library. When that is gone, what are we left 
with? Can Zoom fill that void in any meaningful 
way? 

“Hestia, you ready?” Stephen Latham, profes­
sor of Yale’s popular course Bioethics and Law, 
asks his cat, at the beginning of a pre-recorded 
Zoom lecture. His hair is silver and tousled as he 
raises his cat like Simba in The Lion King. Her 
white paws splay out to her sides and she looks 
straight into the camera with bright green eyes. 
“Go!” he says. But instead, Hestia jumps out 
of his lap and saunters to the door with a meow. 
“We went over this. Alright, go out, but you are 
definitely not getting the salmon.” 

Latham sits again and sighs, “Very unreliable 
cat,” before launching into a fifty-minute lecture. 
At the beginning of each lecture, Latham makes 
his students smile with short skits, ranging from 
him listening to K-Pop songs to him chiding a 
stuffed animal for its prolonged screen time. 

Cormac O’Dea, a professor of economics at 
Yale, is also grappling with the new reality of 
online instruction. Given his discipline, he’s 
more than familiar with the allocation of scarce 
resources—but he never expected that his home 
Wi-Fi would become one. 

Over 120 students join his Zoom lectures on 
Introductory Microeconomics each class, so every 
Monday and Wednesday from 1:00 to 2:15 p.m. 
he has to monopolize the Wi-Fi in his house. “In 
choosing my Wi-Fi package, I did not imagine 
this particular scenario,” O’Dea laughs over our 
Zoom call. 

Teaching over Zoom certainly poses more dif­
ficulties than just Wi-Fi. Like many other profes­
