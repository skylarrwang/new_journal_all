EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
When Elaine came to watch one of my theatre pro­
ductions in February 2020, I teared up when I saw her. 
She sat right in front of the stage (of course), and after 
the performance, I proudly introduced her to all my 
friends there as “my New Haven Grandma.” She told 
me once that she was looking for a young person to 
build a connection with, and just as well, I had been 
searching for a deeper relationship with someone sig­
nificantly senior to me. Last year, my aunt passed away 
three months after we grew close. Since the day we 
met, Elaine has reminded me of my late aunt. 


Elaine and I thought we’d share many more meals 
before my departure from the United States in May, 
when my year-long visiting program at Yale would end. 
But COVID-19 washed up on American shores, and 
my plans changed dramatically. I had to return home 
two months earlier than anticipated. I hastily typed an 
email on a Friday night asking to meet her on Sunday. 
I was anxious about seeing her, since she was turning 
71 this year and the coronavirus disproportionately 
affects older people. We decided to compromise and 
meet as soon as possible to minimize the chances of 
me contracting the disease beforehand. This time, she 
invited me to her home. “Mi casa su casa,” she replied 
on Saturday, “YOU are my whole agenda tomorrow.”


She warned me prior to our meeting that she had 
“inherited rat pack syndrome from both sides of her 
family.” And true enough—a corner of  her apartment 
was stacked almost floor to ceiling with cardboard 
boxes and keepsakes. But Elaine knew her way around 
just fine, reaching into cardboard boxes and pulling out 
one memento after another. A printed scarf emerged 
from a box, a gift she received from three Vietnamese 
friends she met in Cuba in 1971 on the third Vencer­
emos Brigade (which sends delegations to Cuba to 
work in solidarity with Cuban workers). We listened to 
her songs on the many CDs she had recorded, Elaine 
singing along live, almost perfectly on-key. As we sat 
in comfortable silence, I gazed around her apartment 
in admiration; it archived 71 years of a life well-lived, 
a life full of what Elaine calls “backhanded blessings.” 


A sense of finality hung in the air throughout our 
meeting that day – I knew we’d have to say goodbye. 
We walked on the boardwalk at Savin Rock Park and 
sat out at the pier till our hands grew numb from the 
cold, rushing wind, as if doing so would make each 
minute longer. She treated me to an Irish Coffee and 
molten chocolate lava cake at Jimmie’s Restaurant and 
saw me off to my Uber after a long, bittersweet hug. 
The last image we have of each other is us signing “I 
love you” as the car drove away.
