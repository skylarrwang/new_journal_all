sors, O’Dea has had to adapt to a new way of teach­
ing and engaging with students through Zoom. 
Normally while lecturing, O’Dea can look out 
into the audience and gauge student reactions, 
but now it is much harder because students have 
to turn off their video in lecture to conserve his 
Wi-Fi. He cannot tell whether students are smil­
ing when he uses Vizzini from The Princess Bride 
to explain game theory, or whether students are 
following along when he is lecturing on Pareto 
Efficiency and the Second Welfare Theorem. 
“You can’t see if the students are interested, 
bored, excited, or confused,” O’Dea said. 
To overcome these hurdles, O’Dea has kept an 
open mind and found new ways to keep paths of 
communication open, including encouraging par­
ticipation in lectures through interactive activities 
like break-out rooms, open polls, and a suggestion 
box linked on Canvas. “This is as new for me as 
it is for you folks,” O’Dea said, “I don’t have the 
presumption that I know how to do this.” 
O’Dea has also adapted the content of the class 
to the current crisis. At the start of each lecture, he 
shares economic news related to the pandemic. “It 
is important for us as instructors and students to 
engage in the world around us and [understand] 
how this crisis is affecting people other than our­
selves,” O’Dea said.
Although he was worried at first that students 
might not want to hear about the pandemic in 
class, ninety-five percent wanted 
him to continue, according to 
an in-class poll he conducted. 
He finds it important to remem­
ber how the crisis is affecting 
not only the world but also our 
community. “For many stu­
dents, this is not just abstract; 
this is affecting them and their 
families intensely,” O’Dea said. 
Students are facing an over­
load of barriers to full academic 
participation in online classes, 
including 
responsibilities 
at 
home, sick loved ones, lack of 
reliable internet or technol­
ogy, having to get a job, wors­
ened mental health, and vast 
time differences, according to a 
recent poll conducted by the Yale College Coun­
cil. These obstacles, while experienced by every 
student to some degree, are felt most acutely by 
first generation, low income, and international stu­
dents. 


When Keigo Nishio ’21 found out that Yale was 
moving classes online for the rest of the semester, 
he was shocked. He did not understand how he was 
going to overcome the thirteen-hour time differ­
ence between New Haven and his home of Osaka, 
Japan. Since then, Keigo has found a tenuous bal­
ance between school, work, family, and sleep. 
Keigo starts his school day off at midnight. He 
attends his classes until 3 to 4 a.m., works as a 
teaching assistant for a couple hours, and then 
only sleeps one to two hours a night. He cooks 
breakfast at 9 a.m. During the day, he has meet­
ings, chores, and homework, and he tries to nap in 
whatever spare hours are left. 
Despite the challenges posed by the time differ­
ence, he has felt supported by Yale faculty. “Luck­
ily, my professors were all so accommodating,” 
Keigo said, “I really appreciate my professors.” 
Most of his professors started recording class so 
he did not feel obligated to stay up, but he also 
appreciated his professors’ care and consideration. 
They often reached out to check in, his anthro­
pology professor even dedicating time in lecture to 
reach out to see how his students were doing. 


“We, both students and professors, are now 
required to consider and accommodate our diverse 
needs, which is actually an essential thing even at 
normal times,” Keigo said, “I hope this mutual 
care will continue, even after the pandemic is con­
tained.”
When I asked Keigo how he has enough energy 
to get through the day, Keigo said, “I don’t know.” 
He paused. Then, with a laugh: “Somehow it 
works. Everyone has their own way to deal with 
things.” 
Beyond the classroom, students have tried to 
deal with this jarring disruption in their lives by 
reaching out to one another. Almost six hundred 
thousand people have joined the Facebook group 
Zoom Memes for Self Quaranteens where students 
commiserate with each other through TikToks and 
memes, and immortalize moments of levity. Over 
Facebook, students have worked together to make 
masks and support medical staff. No Fail Yale, a 
student driven movement to fight for a universal 
passing grade for all Yale College courses, mobi­
lized students internationally to organize and fight 
for educational equity. 
Yale students have also tried to preserve tradi­
tions through Zoom. Secret societies tap with fur­
tive Zoom invites instead of their traditional night­
time congregations. Political parties of the Yale 
Political Union debate from their kitchen tables. 
Instead of visiting Yale, wandering around in the 
cold, and bouncing from extracurricular booth to 
booth to find pizza, prospective students now par­
ticipate in “30 Bulldog Days of April,” featuring a 
new master class or information session each day. 
One of the most renowned student traditions at 
Yale is Woads. Every Wednesday night, the local 
nightclub Toad’s Place closes the club to every­
one except Yale students, serves penny drinks, and 
offers free and reduced admission. Even though 
students are spread out across the world and social 
distancing, the tradition has not died out. 
Victoria Bonano ’21 hosted a Woads event over 
Zoom––what she calls Zoads. “Zoom… provide[s] 
a platform for all of us to come together and hang 
out, as we usually would while in New Haven, 
despite being so far away from each other at the 
moment,” Bonano said. 
Her co-host Paulina Halley set the mood with 
Sound Activated DJ Lights and a DJ controller. 
Students joined from their bedrooms, from the 
basements of their fraternities, and from all around 
the world, including New York, New Haven, Illi­
nois, California, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Chile. 
“One of the hardest things about not being on 
campus has been missing out on many big events 
all of us were looking forward to, like birthdays and 
formals, as well as day to day activities, like study 
dates and GHeav runs with friends,” Bonano said, 
“Woad’s represents a mid-week study break with our 
friends that we look forward to every Wednesday, so 
we hosted Zoad’s to try to keep some sense of nor­
malcy and fun during these times.”
It was not quite the same––there was more laugh­
ter and chatter than at a typical Woad’s. But it made 
sense that people wanted to talk. After all, it was the 
first time many of them had seen each other since 
they had gone home for spring break.
I am not sure if Zoom can ever approximate what 
it feels like to be at Yale––to trudge up Science Hill 
in the icy slush to get to physics study hall, to wan­
der around campus at night drinking bubble tea, 
to look up and see Harkness Tower and wonder to 
yourself, “How the hell did I end up here?” 
But in the small, precious moments of Zoom, 
when my friend calls me from across the country 
to try to wake me up for class, when our professors’ 
children sneak into lecture behind them, when a 
brave soul in your lecture uses Club Penguin to 
explain game theory––in these moments, the dis­
tance becomes almost bearable. Yale, with all its 
ups and downs, does not seem so far away.
