Matt Song ’23 had a sandwich, a plastic con­
tainer of pudding, Doritos, and a bag of fudge 
stripes for lunch one day in late March. The dining 
halls were closed. His friends were gone from cam­
pus. He ate alone behind the stone and concrete 
walls of Morse College. Without bicycles littering 
the courtyard and students crowding the common 
room, the space is cavernous. As of April 10, he is 
one of ninety-nine students who are remaining on 
Yale’s campus after the University asked all under­
graduates to return home for the rest of the semes­
ter on March 14. 

Yale hired a group of local movers to help the 
fifteen first-years remaining on campus move their 
belongings from Old Campus to residential col­
leges, where they’ll reside for the rest of semes­
ter. On March 19, the overworked movers shifted 
Matt’s boxes to Morse College. Among his posses­
sions were a microwave, packets of frozen food (“In 
case Yale Dining is not feeding me,” he explained), 
and his books. Matt, like all students who remain, 
has swipe access only to the gates and entryways 
of his college, the kitchen, and Trumbull College, 
where his meals are distributed. Twice a day, Matt 
picks up his meal in a brown to-go bag provided 
by Yale Dining. He makes it a point to have his 
dinner outdoors, in the vacant Morse courtyard, to 
feel more normal. 


How can you return home when there is 
no straightforward answer to the question of where 
home is? Evacuations from college campuses, 
shelter-in-place orders, and travel restrictions have 
forced people to decide where they will hunker 
down for the long haul. But a significant minority 
of students do not have a place to go. Foster youth, 
LGBTQ+ individuals living in hostile home envi­
ronments, and international students are particu­
larly vulnerable. Yale is allowing students to remain 
on campus for a limited number of reasons: if 
they’re from CDC Level 3 countries, emancipated 
from their parents, international students affected 
by travel restrictions, or students who would be in 
unsafe living conditions if they left. After speak­
ing to three Yale students who chose to not return 
home, I realized that home could be a place of our 
choosing, or a place that we have no choice but to 
return to. And if you are one of the lucky ones, it 
might be both.

**Title: LIKE HOME**
**Page number(s): 8-9**

When I left Singapore, my family’s home 
for five generations, to fly back to Yale in January, I 
told a friend that I was simply going from one home 
to another. After all, nestled in a hundred-year-old 
brick building in New Haven, was my sunlit desk, 
my books, my towels and sheets, my spare contact 
lenses, and my favourite stuffed bear. Home was a 
feeling. It was swipe access into dining halls and 
Monday dinners with my debate team. It was meet­
ing kind-eyed Muslim leaders in New Haven for an 
article I was writing. It was knowing which cubicles 
in the Sterling Library hold shelves had the good 
seat cushions and which were best for a cry. 

But over spring break, while I was in Mex­
ico, I was banned from reentering the United 
States because I had been in Europe in the past 14 
days. I had celebrated my mother’s 60th birthday 
in the UK. Initially, I had planned to return to my 
off-campus apartment in New Haven to retrieve my 
belongings before returning to Singapore later in 
the month. But now, with only a duffel bag of sum­
mer clothes and none of my books, I scrambled to 
find flights to Singapore that did not layover in a 
U.S. airport. Chicago, Texas, New York, San Fran­
cisco—the biggest aviation hubs were now sealed 
off to me. Minutes passed and the earliest flight 
I could find left Mexico City in a week. Around 
Latin America, countries were closing their bor­
ders in response to a rising number of coronavirus 
cases. I did not know if Mexico would be next. I 
imagined being stuck in Mexico while flights out 
of the country were grounded. I wanted to cry. 

When I realised that I couldn’t board a 
plane taking me back to New Haven, I understood 
that home was no longer the warm feeling I got 
cycling down Cross Campus on the first day of 
spring. Home became a legal term, the only place 
I knew with certainty would always take me in. 

Only U.S citizens, permanent residents, 
and certain immigrant visa holders were permit­
ted to enter under the travel restrictions placed 
to manage COVID-19. As a student visa holder, 
I did not qualify. The Singapore Ministry of For­
eign Affairs had said that all Singaporeans abroad 
will be allowed to return home—they would never 
shut their borders to their citizens. Even though 
I was stranded in Mexico, my displacement was 
only temporary, a mere blink in the long view of 
life. I eventually found an Air Canada flight that 
would take me back home. But what about people 
without a passport, without citizenship, who shut­
tle between iron-clad borders every day, unable 
to find a place that would accept them? Refugees 
and stateless individuals are going to be among 
the hardest hit by the virus if they are left without 
access to healthcare and sanitation.

As I waited for my flight out of Mexico, 
I thought about why I was upset at this situation, 
even though I understood the strong necessity for 
travel restrictions. I realized I felt betrayed; Amer­
ica had softened me, deceived me. In the ease and 
freedom of life in her coffee shops, highways and 
gas stations, I grew too accustomed to thinking of 
her as my home. The welcoming how-are-you’s and 
cheerful smiles of her bus drivers and cashiers, her 
college professors and high schoolers, her watch 
engineers and religious leaders, had lulled me into 
complacency. I drank up what she had to offer and 
sank into her sheets each night believing I’d still 
have a place here tomorrow. This reminded me 
that I am in mere transit in this country. America is 
not my home, however much I want her to be.
Matt realized he hadn’t used his voice for a day. 
He has not had a conversation in person, hugged 
a friend, or spent time in someone else’s presence 
in over a week. Seeing a person on the street now 
strikes him as a noteworthy event. 

Around 11 a.m., he goes to Trumbull College to 
collect his paper-bagged meal. He sees a couple of 
other students like him picking up their meals; it’s 
one of his rare moments of human interaction in a 
day. He is the only Morse first-year still on-campus, 
“which makes me special and also lonely,” he said 
through a phone interview, laughing. 

At night, he walks around Yale’s unoccupied cob­
blestone-lined campus, alone, looking at the stars. 
Just two weeks ago he was with his friends, adjust­
ing to his first -year in a new country as well as a 
new school. Now, it is completely empty. 

When Matt first received the email asking all stu­
dents not to return to campus after spring break, he 
knew he wanted to stay in the U.S. He had lived 
in Shanghai since he was twelve, but the home he 
grew up in no longer belonged to his family. With 
his mother and grandmother in Michigan, and 
his father in Shanghai, it was simpler for him to 
stay on campus, as he’s from a CDC Level 3 coun­
try. Furthermore, flight tickets to Shanghai were 
expensive. It would have imposed a greater shock 
on his life to move back.
