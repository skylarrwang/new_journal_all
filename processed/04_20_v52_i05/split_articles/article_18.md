THE SURVIVOR
BY CAITLIN O’HARA
After an encounter on the New Haven Green, an unlikely friendship sparks between 
a visiting student and longtime disability rights activist Elaine Kolbe.
Through my camera’s viewfinder, I could scarcely 
make out someone signing ‘I love you’ to me in 
ASL among the throngs of supporters at New 
Haven’s climate rally in September 2019. I put my 
camera down and saw Elaine Kolb beaming as she 
approached me, a faint squeak audible as her power 
chair rolled across the New Haven Green. She had 
a ‘BLACK LIVES MATTER’ button on her shirt, a 
rainbow-printed 
ban­
dana tied around her 
neck, peace sign neck­
laces to gift to pass­
ers-by, and a sticker 
reading 
‘DISABLED 
AND PROUD’ on the 
back of her wheelchair.
I figured she must 
have noticed me point­
ing the camera in her 
general direction and 
decided to pose for a 
photo with the ‘I love 
you’. After a brief self-in­
troduction, she began 
talking about her experience living with a disabil­
ity. “There’ve been many times when people—total 
strangers—came up to me and asked, ‘Were you 
born that way?’” she said to me. I wasn’t sure how 
to respond to her sharing something so intimate 
even though we’d just met. She broke my silence 
and carried on, “You know what my reply to them 
is? ‘Well, actually no. When I was born, I was a 
lot smaller!’” She burst loudly into laughter, and I 
chuckled politely. I couldn’t help but wonder how 
she confessed a hard truth and laughed afterward, 
combatting insensitivity with humor. 

She reached into a purple and orange haversack and 
handed me a sheet of freshly printed song lyrics. I asked 
if she had written them, and she pulled out a whole 
book of songs she authored. She sang one of them to 
me. Her voice was  beautiful—soulful and resounding. 
Elaine flipped to her biography in the songbook and 
handed it to me. I skimmed 
through it, but found myself 
re-reading one sentence: 
“In September 1977, Elaine 
was stabbed in the back by a 
mugger on the street, result­
ing in a spinal cord injury.” 
She was 28 years old. 


Elaine grew up watching 
civil 
rights 
demonstra­
tors 
on 
television 
in 
the 
1950s 
and 
1960s. 
“I always admired the 
ones that were willing to risk great things for pos­
itive principles that would help people… And so 
part of it was just as soon as I had a chance to do 
it, I started doing it. It seemed [like] a natural thing 
to me.”
In high school, Elaine gave a speech against the 
Vietnam War; in college, she directed her school’s 
volunteer program and helped the new Black Stu­
dent Union organize a Black arts and music festival. 
She’s since participated in demonstrations and writ


ten dozens of songs about climate change, wom­
en’s rights, disability, and more. She aptly describes 
herself as  “a disability and diversity rights artist/activ­
ist, singer-songwriter, performer, and grass-roots 
organizer.” (She also describes herself as “a fat, old, 
ruddy-white dyke, driving a 6-wheeled power wheel­
chair, flying a rainbow flag, with a squeaky wheel.”) 
Elaine has been arrested 27 times in the course of 
her 53 years of activism work—including once with 
the new Poor People’s Campaign - A National Call for 
Moral Revival. Mostly, she practices non-violent, civil 
disobedience with the American Disabled for Atten­
dant Programs Today (ADAPT) and Not Dead Yet. In 
2017, she was arrested along with four other disability 
rights activists for refusing to vacate the governor’s 
office in Hartford, in protest of budget cuts affecting 
communities in need—including the disabled. She 
was also arrested several times in the struggle to get 
the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) passed. It 
was thanks to the ADA that disability access routes 
were installed at Savin Rock Park, where we met for 
our interviews. 

Not Dead Yet fights against assisted suicide for dis­
abled persons. While people on one side of the debate 
see assisted suicide as a right and exercise of patient 
autonomy, most disability rights advocates see it as a 
deadly form of discrimination. Their work combats 
the manifestations of what Elaine and other disability 
rights activists call disabiliphobia—the fear of disabil­
ity expressed by the disrespect for, prejudice against, 
and distancing from people with disability. Elaine 
explains that disability is the only minority that any­
body can join at any moment, whether through illness 
or accident. “Most non-disabled people have a really 
difficult time because of their fear of becoming dis­
abled themselves.”
This fear has led others to say hurtful things to 
Elaine.  “People will say to me, ‘Oh Elaine you’re so 
amazing, you’re so brave! You go out there and do 
everything, and if I was like you, I’d rather be dead.’ 
They think they’re complimenting me that I’m so 
brave, that they’d rather be dead than be me? This is 
not a compliment!” She laughs in exasperation, then 
alludes to the assisted suicide of disabled people, “This 
is why so many of our people get dead!”
At this point, I start to feel a little uncomfortable—
this fear of life with a disability has crossed my mind 
before. We are sitting in Jimmie’s Restaurant, and it’s 
crowded. I take an anxious sip of my latte and avert 
my gaze, watching the other customers eating their 


seafood platters and burgers instead of looking at 
Elaine. But she admits she once had this fear, too: “I 
did not understand and appreciate how much of my 
identity was tied up in my physical capacity and how 
deeply I feared having a physical disability where I 
couldn’t run… once I couldn’t run anymore, I really 
was more vulnerable.” Recounting the struggles she 
faced adapting to the injury, she shares, “I had to 
also rebuild a way of being confident and being able 
to travel in the world by myself… when you have a 
visible, obvious disability, it’s like you have a flash­
ing neon sign on your forehead that says ‘Easy Vic­
tim! Come and get it!’” I think back to that image 
of her when we first met, with her rainbow flag and 
scarf and loud stickers and buttons (and she’s always 
dressed that way). She sure had confidence, but 
maybe it was out of necessity.
Despite her accomplishments, Elaine is still hard 
on herself. “I feel guilty that I haven’t done more. 
And I’ve been a compulsive overachiever…with this 
deep-seated sense of guilt and shame that I deserve 
to be punished. Whatever recognition I received I 
would have to find a way to punish myself to coun­
terbalance it.”
She tears up slightly as she says this, before laugh­
ing loudly again—exactly as she did when we first 
met. “This is very complicated!” I think back to how 
she told me she experienced her first hysterical out­
burst at age twelve, yelling between her sobs, “I hate 
my mind!” Her teacher then, Ms. Otruba, sat and 
cried with her. “I don’t know if I would still be here 
except that she cried with me and she said, ‘Elaine, 
you have a beautiful mind.’”
“I can point to certain things in my life, that with­
out them, I don’t know how I could have survived… 
I was given these gifts, or these people appeared at 
just the right time or things just happened a certain 
way and you know, a slight variation and I would 
have been gone; I would have just been lost.” Specif­
ically about her stabbing, she tells me, “as bad as it 
was, it was as good as it could be.”
I’m almost relieved by how much Elaine has to say. 
After all, how do you respond to someone who con­
fesses after having met you two weeks ago that, as 
a troubled teen, she might have spiraled into drug 
use if then she had access to heavy drugs; who was 
severely ostracized upon coming out as a lesbian in 
the 1970s; who survived two traumatic rapes; who 
holds your hand while recounting the deaths of 
partners, family and friends; who was stabbed half 
a block from her home at age 28? I couldn’t find the 
right words to return her vulnerability and strength. 


Two interviews later, I knew so much more about 
Elaine. She deliberately keeps her wheel squeaky 
because of a promise she made to a visually impaired 
friend (who could place her more easily in space). She 
has two cats named Izzy and Bonnie-boy who “help 
lessen tactile deprivation.” She is a woman of confi­
dence coupled with a sense of inadequacy; loudness 
coupled with silence; profound loss coupled with a 
sense of being blessed. 
The more Elaine shared with me, the more she 
asked about me in return. I told her about my parents 
and older brother back home, about how I aspired to 
be an OB/GYN catering to the healthcare needs of 
marginalized populations, and about what I loved to 
do, like embroidery and theatre. Hearing this, Elaine 
invited me to participate in a community theatre piece 
about disability and difference with her and four oth­
ers. It was the second installment of the Hear My Soul 
Speak series—a set of plays devised around various 
themes of social justice, produced by the Elm Shake­
speare Company. Despite having to miss rock climb­
ing practices in order to attend rehearsals, I agreed to 
participate—something just told me it’d be worth it. 
And it was. We performed a series of scenes depict­
ing how the disabled are commonly discriminated 
against, and offered do’s and don’ts on interact­
ing with the disabled. To top things off, we led the 
crowd in a song that Elaine wrote in 1981 (while on 
a Fulbright scholarship as part of the United Nations 
International Year of Disabled Persons) about the 
institutionalization of the disabled. Following the 
performance, Elaine and I met for meals, shared 
an hour-long phone call, and exchanged dozens of 
emails. Over time, that stranger I encountered on the 
New Haven Green became my trusted confidante and 
greatest giver of advice. She walked me through the 
doubts I was having about myself at school, guided 
me through my then long-distance relationship, and 
never failed to remind me to wear layers (something 
I wasn’t at all used to, coming from equatorial Singa­
pore). She had predicted it in one of her first emails to 
me, dated October 1, 2019: “while I am old enough to 
be your grandma, I feel like we are sisters ;-)”.
