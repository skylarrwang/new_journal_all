pression of shoes that rarely come off. Hand washing 
requires a hunt for an obliging restaurant’s bathroom. 
Lack of access to nutritious food increases the risk for 
type 2 diabetes. The alternating realities of weather 
exposure, and tightly packed shelters—which can have 
up to eight people crowded into four feet of space—
means that staving off infection from airborne viruses 
is difficult, if not impossible. And with the closure of 
homeless shelters, a severe situation has become a 
nightmare. “There’s folks that are living with condi­
tions that are going to be far exacerbated by the fact 
that they don’t have a place to get a steady meal, a 
place to get out of this cold, or being able to charge 
their phones and keep up on their appointments,” said 
Serio. “I’m just as worried about somebody’s on again, 
off again treated diabetes as I am about COVID.”

In most cases of COVID-19 infection, early hospital­
ization and medical care will mean recovery. But Serio 
is worried that systemic discrimination may prevent 
members of SWAN from finding their way to hospitals 
in time—and that those who do may experience a hos­
tile reception. 

Codianni told me about her own experiences at 
medical centers—stories of derogatory name-calling, 
being forced to wait longer than other clients. While 
the treatment of sex workers varies from clinic to clinic, 
there are practical measures that prevent equal access 
to testing. “Folks have to have a car to get tested at 
drive-through places. And people need to have state 
issued photo ID on hand and other documents in order 
to get the referral in the first place.” 

With the majority of survival sex workers unwilling 
or unable to seek out clinics, a few medical profession­
als have decided to take their services to them. Phil 
Costello, director of Homeless Care at Hill Health 
Center, is one of them. I asked him how COVID-19 
had affected his work. “Other than wearing face masks 
and gloves and PPE… we haven’t drawn back,” Costello 
said. “[The homeless] aren’t going to go to doctors and 
ERs… because of the humanity they feel they lose in 
those places.” As the majority of people sleeping on the 
street have a chronic cough, Costello relies on the inti­
mate task of taking temperatures to diagnose infection.

“I think a lot of people are going to do as they tend to 
always do,” Costello said quietly. “Just keep, you know, 
running and existing how they know how until they get 
so sick that an ambulance is called.” 

As the number of COVID-19 cases in New Haven 
climbs, the perennial problem of homelessness in the 
city has taken on a new sense of urgency. The prev­
alence of survival sex work in New Haven is tied to 
the city’s lack of affordable housing; nearly all of those 
who find themselves without homes resort to street sex 
work at some point to survive. Codianni’s main con­
cern is that the majority of SWAN’s members are still 
on the street—a problem that SWAN doesn’t have the 
resources to address. 

“The biggest thing is interior spaces, right?” Serio 
remarked. “There are a couple of agencies that house 
folks in the city, but there was still homelessness before 
this pandemic. They were already living with a real­
ity where homelessness exists, which means that there 
were already not enough interior spaces.” With home­
less shelters closing one after another to avoid acting as 
nurseries for the virus, the city’s three thousand–strong 
homeless population is being turned onto the street as 
New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker scrambles to find and 
fund the interior space necessary for the homeless to 
“shelter in place.”

Elicker faced two options: house the homeless in 
the city’s empty hotels, or ask the city’s universities for 
access to their thousands of vacant dorm rooms. After 
an initial request for Yale to open its doors to house first 
responders and firefighters—to which Yale’s answer was 
no, carefully packaged in statements of remorse and 
concerns about moving students belongings—the Uni­
versity eventually agreed to house 300 first responders. 
Elicker then turned to the city’s hotels to take in the 
homeless, including the street sex worker population.

THE  NEW  JOURNAL
But on April 6, the plan to house people in the Best 
Western hotel fell through. West Haven Police Chief 
Joseph S. Perno had requested close to five thou­
sand dollars to hire police officers for the  “safety and 
well-being of those housed,” and the city’s budget had 
buckled under the additional costs.

The policing of homeless housing presents a serious 
threat to providing shelter for those still sleeping on the 
streets. “They expect people to just come into the hotel 
room and leave everything behind,” Codianni mut­
tered. “No. Some of the people who are going to come 
in have mental health issues or drug use and they’re 
going to throw them out again.” Codianni explained 
that survival sex workers are often turned away from 
shelters due to continued drug habits or limited num­
ber of shelter beds. As the city considers how best to 
save lives, street medic Evan Serio is concerned that 
putting regulation before safety will be reflected in the 
death count. “Are you doing this to save people’s lives, 
from keeping them from getting sick or affected?” he 
asked, “Or are you doing it to try to change their way of 
life to meet your standards?”

I put down the phone after my call with Codianni, 
only to find it ringing again minutes later. I pick up and 
hear her New England accent on the other side: “Well, 
aren’t we going to talk about Yale?” 

New Haven and Yale have been in a muted dead­
lock over Yale’s ballooning real estate holdings and lack 
of tax payments for years, but the coronavirus has laid 
bare the cracks in the University’s relationship with its 
host city. To Codianni, Yale’s closed doors and empty 
dorm space are the marks of its continued disregard 
for New Haven’s needs. “They said they were setting 
up the [Lanman gymnasium] for the Yale community. 
Well you know what, this is the New Haven commu­
nity!” Codianni nearly yelled into the phone. With 
just a wall separating the empty dorms of Old Cam­
pus from homeless sleepers on the Green, the disparity 
has become impossible for organizations like SWAN 
to ignore. “People are out in the cold. It’s still cold out 
here. People are hungry. People need a place to go to 
the bathroom. Open your goddamn door, Yale.”

Codianni repositions the phone, and I hear the 
plastic rustle of groceries bags being put down on the 
kitchen table. As a member of the age group most 
threatened by the coronavirus, I asked whether she’d 
considered the risk of continuing her work. 

“I’ve cut down a lot,” she responded. “I mean, I used 
to be out there every day, and now I go… maybe three 
times in the last three weeks,” she said with a sigh. 
“But they’re not just members, they’re friends now. 
They are, you know, our tribe.” I asked her whether 
she’d taken up any hobbies (baking bread? gardening?) 
during quarantine. “Um, conference calls,” she replied 
with a rasping laugh. “I’m still working closely with the 
Global Health Justice Partnership, planning strategies 
of what we’re going to do, what we can do.”

The peak of the infection curve for Connecticut is 
expected around mid-May. Despite the work of the city 
and non-profits, the majority of the homeless popula­
tion and survival sex workers may weather that peak on 
street curbs, or gathered together around benches on 
the Green. But the members of SWAN haven’t resigned 
themselves to New Haven going the way of Boston. As 
the infection and death figures climb steadily, Codi­
anni sits at home and reaches out to anyone who will 
listen—governors, philanthropists, and reporters.

“And you can’t shut me up, as you just found out.”
