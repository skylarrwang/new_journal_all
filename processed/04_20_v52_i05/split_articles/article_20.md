Morning	
   ladies through
their poses              pages upon
pages of peace              which I
flip quickly as	             morning
clouds burn up                as gas
where in his wisdom   flipping
 is talk of love 	
  yawning
morning lifts her	
          legs
coffee’s ready       I am the only
one awake 	
            like Allen
while steamships    carry on in
poses	          arms thrown back
the waking smell 	
         I am
awake                       asking sink
where’s that	             soft name
in all this        	              morning
gratitude for life          the taste
is sweet            I added nothing
the ships 	
	
         wait
like ladies reaching      through
top-flaps of white tents      I am
flipping 	
               footfalls 
father  mother  sister        other
              morning
coffee’s ready             the clouds 
burn as gas	
	
        there
are many names	
         blue
black silver	
                   Allen
none	               of them is right.
