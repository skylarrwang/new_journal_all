Dear readers,
In a time of social isolation, we can find togetherness through storytelling—through listening to the voices of those 
you know and those you don’t. The New Journal’s mission for fifty-three years has been to produce human-centered 
narrative journalism. These are strange, uncharted times, but they remind us more than ever that stories reinforce 
our sense of common humanity.
We bring to you the voices of students who are grappling with the idea of what academic excellence and grades 
mean during a global public health crisis, students who are lingering behind in an empty campus, and students who 
are trying to find out what “home” truly means to them. We follow the extraordinary efforts of a New Haven activist 
supporting survival sex workers during the pandemic, and we witness the trajectory of an unlikely close friendship 
between a disability rights activist and a visiting student. Our feature paints a vivid picture of a Muslim man’s 
decades-long resistance to deportation, and our issue ends on a poignant note about how Yalies can still remain 
together, even when apart, through Zoom. 
Our editors, scattered from Connecticut to California to Hong Kong to Illinois, have reunited through the screen to 
create The New Journal’s first ever remotely produced issue. Let us know your thoughts on the magazine, or about 
any ideas you’d like to share with us—we’d love to start a conversation.  
Yours,
Helena & Candice
