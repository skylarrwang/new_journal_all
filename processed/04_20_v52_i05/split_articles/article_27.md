THE  NEW  JOURNAL
I meet Sujitno Sajuti on a Friday afternoon in late 
February. He greets me, impassive eyes appraising this 
Chinese girl who has entered his house of worship, a 
mosque in Hartford, Connecticut, to hear the story of 
what he lived through: he was targeted by U.S. Immi­
gration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for deporta­
tion, spent 599 days in sanctuary, and finally was able 
to leave in the summer of 2019.

His face is lined with crevice-like wrinkles. He 
slouches a little. He came to this country when he 
was 32 years old. He is now 71 and has spent more 
than half his life here. And yet, he still has the threat 
of deportation hanging over his head. Even though he 
is free from sanctuary—where he took refuge in a Mer­
iden church as a form of protection against arrest and 
deportation—his struggle with his immigration status 
is far from over. His legal team is working to vacate 
his deportation order as we speak, and until they suc­
ceed, he will remain at risk of being removed from the 
place he calls home. This summer, two Yale seniors, 
Jordan Cozby and Christina Pao, are launching a dig­
ital archive about the interfaith sanctuary movement 
in Connecticut, featuring Sujitno’s story. And as the 
next U.S. presidential election fast approaches, undoc­
umented immigrants like Sujitno wait to see whether 
the past four years of increased deportations and ICE 
arrests will become a historical anomaly, a blight on 
the long arc of justice, or the new normal.


It is Ramadan in 2018. But Sujitno Sajuti and his 
wife, Dahlia, are not breaking fast with their friends 
from the mosque upon the evening call to prayer. They 
are in the meeting house of Connecticut’s Unitarian 
Universalist Church of Meriden, where Sujitno has 
been taking sanctuary from ICE agents since October 
9, 2017.

They share a small room, no bigger than ten feet 
across, on the second floor of an old farmhouse in 
the town of Meriden, Connecticut. They have a trun­
dle bed, dresser, desk, and closet. It is not their West 
Hartford apartment in a brick building with wrought-
iron railings that they have called home for the past 
twenty years, but they don’t have a choice. They must 
stay inside—Sajuti faces an ICE deportation removal 
order.

On Mondays, Thursdays, and for three days in the 
middle of the Islamic month, they fast. To keep his 
spirit strong, Sujitno reads the Koran. He memorises 
the Surah Ar-Rahman, a chapter in the holy book 
which calls for man to express gratitude toward Allah. 
He prays for justice. He and his wife wake every morn­
ing well before dawn, between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m., while 
a church volunteer sleeps in a cot downstairs, keeping 
vigil in case ICE comes knocking. The arrangement 
was made by the Chalice Sanctuary Team within the 
first day of Sujitno moving in. The team is a self-or­
ganised group of fifteen-odd church members who 
decided to contribute their time and resources to pro­
vide sanctuary to Sujitno.

While the couple washes their hands, mouth, nos­
trils, arms, head, and feet in accordance with the 
Islamic practice known as wudu, the volunteer sleep­
ing downstairs rises. On Sundays, while the congre­
gation meets in the sanctuary to sing Unitarian Uni­
versalist hymns and light the chalice, the couple rests. 
Unitarian Universalism is a liberal, non-doctrinal reli­
gion that emerged when two separate faiths with roots 
in early Christianity, Unitarianism and Universalism, 
consolidated in the second half of the twentieth cen­
tury. The church and the couple have developed a 
delicate rhythm to negotiate the differences between 
their faiths.

I spoke to Sujitno and five of the people at the core 
of the complicated, high-stakes endeavour to protect 
him from deportation, which has spanned multiple 
years and involved a legal team, more than a dozen 
church volunteers, fellow mosque members, and many 
well-wishers. The story of Sujitno Sajuti and the Mer­
iden church that sheltered him for close to two years 
is one of inter-faith empathy and the deep capacity of 
human beings to care for their neighbours.


Almost three years ago, on Monday, October 9, 2017, 
at 4 p.m., Reverend Jan Carlsson-Bull, then the minis­
ter of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Meriden, 
received a call from Reverend Paul Fleck, the pas­
tor who initiated the movement to declare sanctuary 
congregations in Connecticut. Fleck informed Carls­
son-Bull that Sujitno Sajuti was due to be deported the 
next day. He needed to find a place that would give 
him sanctuary, where ICE agents could not arrest him. 
The church’s Board of Trustees had voted to become a 
sanctuary congregation just weeks prior.

Immediately, Reverend Carlsson-Bull called for an 
emergency phone conference with the leaders of the 
congregation, including Nancy Burton, a midwife who 
would soon lead Sujitno’s sanctuary team, and several 
Connecticut immigration activists. By 8 p.m., they 
voted yes. The Unitarian Universalist Church of Mer­
iden would become an active sanctuary congregation, 
and Sujitno and Dahlia would be their first guests.

Within hours, the team brought in a cot, linens, tow­
els, and bathroom supplies from the church members’ 
homes and converted the empty second floor office 
into a bedroom.

Fourteen miles away, Sujitno Sajuti was pack­
ing in his apartment. Just days prior, his request for 
a stay of deportation had been denied for the second 
time. Before Donald Trump was elected, he had been 
granted repeated stays of removal annually from when 
the original deportation order was issued in 2004. But 
now, he was fighting to remain in the country under an 
administration that was aggressively acting on the Pres­
ident’s post-election declaration to deport two to three 
million undocumented immigrants from the country.

“Bring everything, quick, whatever we can bring,” 
he told his wife. They searched for the few hundred 
dollars they had saved from teaching Indonesian 
cooking in Connecticut but could not find it. They 
later found it hidden in their Koran. Sujitno brought 
clothes, books, and, most importantly, his immigration 
documents. Dahlia took her wedding ring and a gold 
necklace from her mother, who had passed away in 
1999 in Indonesia. Even though Dahlia was not at risk 
for deportation, she accompanied her husband.

At the church, Steve Volpini, a former reporter, 
 29
ex-Catholic and long-time acquaintance of Sujitno 
and Dahlia, helped them move their suitcases to the 
makeshift bedroom. Carlsson-Bull and some church 
members drafted a letter to the U.S. Attorney for the 
District of Connecticut and to the regional ICE office 
notifying them that Sujitno was in sanctuary with the 
Unitarian Universalist Church in Meriden.

At 11 a.m. the next day, barely awake, Carlsson-Bull 
held a press conference in the meeting room of their 
church—aptly called “the sanctuary.” Standing at the 
pulpit of the large room lined with windows, Carls­
son-Bull announced that Sujitno Sajuti, ordered by 
ICE to leave the country by 10 October 2017, would 
take sanctuary in their church for as long as necessary 
to prevent his deportation.

A band of a dozen-odd Unitarian Universalists were 
soon to become experts in giving sanctuary. Nancy 
would take the lead. Steve would take care of food. 
Diane and Maureen would organize shifts for over­
night duty—a team member would sleep in the church 
every night in case of unexpected visits by ICE agents 
or troublemakers. Richard and other members would 
do the couple’s laundry in their own homes. Sandy 
would set up WiFi for their guests. Peg and Carls­
son-Bull emailed and phoned Unitarian Universalist 
sanctuary congregations around the country to learn 
from their experiences. There was a lot of work to be 
done. They needed to raise funds and find doctors will­
ing to provide medical care to Sujitno if an emergency 
arose. “We weren’t sure how much risk we were taking 
as individuals and for the church,” Nancy said later. 
“But this was what we were going to do.”



The members of the Unitarian Universalist Church 
of Meriden were heroic in their last-minute effort to 
provide sanctuary to Sujitno. The question is, why was 
it necessary?

One part of the answer involves the status of sanctu­
ary institutions. ICE has an internal policy of not mak­
ing arrests in schools, hospitals, or houses of worship. 
But even though all houses of worship are, in princi­
ple, protected spaces, no mosque has been reported as 
having offered sanctuary to persons under threat from 
deportation as of 2018. Sujitno’s mosque in Hartford, 
the Muhammad Islamic Center of Greater Hartford, 
had considered giving sanctuary to him. “We would 
have been the first Masjid to be tested with the laws 
that were already in place,” Imam Kashif Abdul-Karim 
said, “We were afraid that the Patriot Act might create 
new rules, which would not offer him the same pro­
tections as if he was a Christian facility. And we didn’t 
want Sujitno to be put under a test. We wanted his 
safety first and foremost.”

The immunity held by individuals in sanctuary from 
ICE arrests is not legally enshrined. This fact makes it 
unclear how safe Sujitno would have been if he had 
taken sanctuary in his mosque instead.

Less than nine months prior, the Trump adminis­
tration had implemented the Muslim ban. But Imam 
Kashif and his wife had received death threats for being 
Muslim long before the ban, and were cautious of the 
possibility of anti-Muslim attacks. They decided that 
Sujitno would be safer in a non-Muslim house of wor­
ship.

The second part of the answer goes back to a law 
from 19 years ago, which first trapped Sujitno in the 
deportation order.

The Patriot Act, signed into law in 2001 by President 
George W. Bush, allows the government to use law 
enforcement to search homes or businesses without 
the owner’s consent and indefinitely hold suspects, for 
the purpose of countering terrorism. The act spawned 
the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System 
(NSEERS), which tracked the movement of mostly 
Arab and Muslim non-citizens. Like thousands of other 
immigrants in the US, Sujitno reported to the govern­
ment under this system. But this action directly led to 
him becoming known to ICE. That’s when he was tar­
geted for deportation.

When he reported for registration, his counsel failed 
to advocate for him. She never discussed his eligibility 
to stay in the country with the immigration officials. 
The Immigration and Naturalization Service staff ini­
tially denied him the right to have his counsel pres­
ent, but when they eventually allowed her to join him, 
the lawyer left early. Sujitno had to navigate the reg­
istration process alone. Sujitno was then served with 
a notice to appear that initiated removal proceedings, 
where his lawyer accepted a voluntary departure order 
on his behalf without fully informing Sujitno. There 
was no Indonesian language interpreter at the hearing, 
and the audio recording makes it clear that Sujitno did 
not comprehend what was going on.
