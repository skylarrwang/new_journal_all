**DOD funding and Yale research**

In a little room on the third floor of the 
Osborn Memorial Laboratory, Dr. 
Walter Tabachnick attends to forty 
cardboard containers that look like pint-
size cartons of generic ice cream. 
Tabachnick selects one from the rack 
and reveals that its top is covered by a 
screen; inside is not rum raisin, but four 
buzzing mosquitoes. The three raisins 
on the top are for the bugs to feed on. 
Tabachnick, a 34-year old pos.t-
doctoral fellow in the biology depart-
ment, wears aT-shirt and blue jeans to 
work. He still remembers the days 
when, as a graduate student at Rutgers, 
he protested against U.S. military 
policy during the Vietnam War. He 
recalls many occasions when someone 
would mention a professor's name at a 
rally. Someone else would jump up and 
shout, "Oh, him! He's getting DOD 
money!" The whole crowd would turn 
against the professor. "It was like the 
red scare," he says. 


Tabachnick's views about the 
military have not changed much since 
those days, but today the bill for those 
mosquitoes-and $29,000 of what it 
costs each year to experiment with 
them-is paid by the U.S. Army. His 
work is part of the Army's effort to leam 
about and control mosquito-transmitted 
viruses, an area of public health that the 
army has led for 85 years. 


Twenty-seven research projects in the 
Yale Faculty of Arts and Sciences were 
.funded by the Department of Defense 
last year. Though none of the work can 
be classified, and none of the professors 
design weapons, a handful of resear-
chers openly admit they could be laying 
the theoretical groundwork for new 
weapons technology such as high-power 
lasers and submarine tracking systems. 


How it works 
To get a DOD grant or contract, a pro-
fessor submits a proposal to the Army, 
the Navy, or the Air Force. DOD agen-
cies then provide grants to Yale for 
basic research, as does the National 
Science Foundation. 


Last year, the DOD awarded $3.6 
million to Yale for research, an 89 per 
cent increase over the previous year. 
That's a drop in the bucket compared to 
MIT, which received $154.6 million, 
but it puts Yale at number 186 of the 
top 500 prime military research and 
development contractors-above Cor-
nell, Princeton and Brown, as well as 
Lockheed Electronics, Ralston Purina 
and War Incorporated of Rockville, 
Maryland. 


The Medical School and SOM re-
ceive relativdy little DOD money, but 
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences gets 


about fourteen per cent of its research 
money from DOD grants. Without the 
DOD's support, Yale's research pro-
gram would "shut itself down," said 
Richard Chang, an Engineering and 
Applied Science professor working on 
three DOD projects. "The amount of 
research activity would drop so sig-
nificantly" that many distinguished pro-
fessors would have to leave Yale, he 
said. The University would also lose the 
portion of DOD money that helps pay 
its general expenses. Chang said 58 per-
cent of DOD money pays Yale's "in-
direct costs" such as equipment, elec-
tricity and heating. 


-Because a researcher's work may pro-
vide only a small piece of knowledge 
later applied by some other researcher, 
professors are often left in the dark 
about the specific military applications 
of their work. Professor Ira Bernstein, 
Silliman Master William Bennett received DOD funding for laser work in the 'sixties. 
for example, said his research in 
theoretical physics "has military applica-
tions, and that of course is why the 
DOD funds it. But those applications 
are classified." So classified, in fact, that 
Bernstein said he does not know what 
they are, and, he adds, "I prefer not to 
know." 


Buck Rogers-style contraptions 
Professor William Bennett has con-
sidered the implications of DOD fun-
ding. He has done gas laser research on 
DOD grants since 1962. 


The Pentagon's principal interest in 
~asers lies in three areas: space station 
weapons, which could shoot down 
missiles; isotope enrichment, which 
could make nuclear weapons produc-
tion cheaper; and target systems, which 
could guide "smart weapons." 


Bennett stressed that his work at Yale 
never had "any obvious military ap-
plication" in these areas, but he 
recognizes "an indirect applicability of 
the stuff." 


"The sort of research I have done and 
tend to do in this field certainly is in-
volved as a stepping stone in these 
things," he said. "It's not aimed mainly 
at targeting bombs or isotope enrich-
ment per se, although I did have some 
ideas along the line that were relevent to 
those problems.". 


The DOD didn't come up with the 
idea of ·laser weapons on its ow.n. In 
1959 a former Columbia colleague of 
Bennett's named Gerald Gould pur-
suaded the DOD that lasers might have 
useful applications in shooting down 
missiles, Bennett said. Bennett came to 
Yale in 1962, and when he did, _Yale 
became a beneficiary of the DOD's 
growing interest in lasers- to the tune 
of $150,000 to $200,000 a year. Ben-
Walter Tabachniclc conducting mosqur·to reseq.rch in his lah. 
nett's funding dropped in the mid-70s 
and was cut altogether two years ago, 
and though he expects the Air Force to 
approve his proposal for a grant to con-
tinue laser work this fall, it will pro-
bably be much smaller than in the early 
years. 


That does not mean the DOD has 
lost interest in lasers. In a recent report 
to Congress, the DOD asked for in-
creased funding of laser research. "A 
space laser race will be compelling to 
enter, to lead and to win," the report 
said. 


Bennett, however, refers to space 
lasers as "Buck Rogers-style contrap-
tions" that have little practical value as 
weapons. The overweening confidence 
the DOD appears to have in their abili-
ty to protect us from nuclear attack wor-
ries Bennett very much. He believes it 
could lead us to take excessive risks and 
neglect arms control efforts. 


He feels no more comfortable with 
the implications of laser isotope enrich-
ment. By using lasers to separate 
uranium or plutonium isotopes, nuclear 
weapons makers could cut their costs 
dramatically. Currently, the high cost 
of uranium enrichment is one of the few 
roadblocks preventing small powers 
from building nuclear arsenals. But if 
laser enrichment plans succeed, many 
more countries would be able to afford 
membership in the nuclear club. 


Yale researchers are in disagreement 
as to the strength of the DOD's in-
fluence over the work they do. While 
most interviewed defended their DOD 
contracts, saying the DOD never 
solicited their services, some say the 
DOD freely drops hints at scientific
