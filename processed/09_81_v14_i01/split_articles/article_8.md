to act in the future, but I don't think I'll 
go looking for parts for a little while." 
Black has been spending increasing 
amounts of time studying Icelandic. 
His goal is to approach the rich Icelan-
dic sagas and the intricate legal system 
they describe "with a good understan-
ding of colloquial Icelandic." 
His interest in Iceland developed by 
chance. "R.F.L. is what the sociologists 
call it: Rabbit's Foot Luck. I wanted to 
visit someplace very, very cold, with 
de-e-e-ep snowdrifts. Iceland! What 
could be better! I bought plane tickets 
and began to read about the place." He 
discovered that Iceland has a temperate 
climate and hardly any deep snow 
drifts. "By the time I got that far I was 
interested in the tremendous system 
they have. Think of it: 230,000 people 
support a symphony, a theater, a 
modern hospital, an opera, an airline, a 
booming fishing industry, an entire 
government and judiciary, ... That's 
fewer people than live in Austin, Texas. 
They hold two jobs each, for the most 
part, and they're not just getting by, 
they're thriving!" 


Today Charles Black continues his civil 
rights efforts, writing and lecturing 
against capital punishment, which he 
calls "extremely racist." His book Capill.zl 
Punishmmt: The IMViU:lblity of Caprice and 
Mistahs (which he wrote in just three 
weeks) is the nearest thing that op-
ponents of the death penalty have to a 
Bible. 
'"There were 114 people on Death 
Row when I wrote the book," he said. 
'"That seemed like a lot. Today there are 
739. Why this hesitation to execute? It's 
a very strange thing. I see it as the prin-
ciple reaffirmed, the principle of not 
taking a human life. My book tries to 
show that capital punishment is fraught 
with error, even if you approve in 
theory of executing criminals. Which I 
do not." 
Black has avoided litigating capital 
punishment cases in favor of writing 
books and delivering lectures on the 
subject. "I wanted to avoid any risk of 
conflict of interest as long as I was 
writing. 
"' am in a trough right now in my 
legal writing. I am discouraged and 
bewildered by the situation in Wash-
ington and I don't quite know which 
direction to take or where to exert my 
efforts . . . I am totally reso!utely, and 
as a matter of lifelong conviction against 
everything 
that 
President 
Reagan 
stands for . . . I've been fighting the 
good fight for 34 years, though, so I 
guess I have a right to a little time off. â€¢ 
For the moment, teaching is more 


important to him than writing. His ma-
jor project last summer was a revision of 
the syllabus for his constitutional law 
course. "The impressive thing is that the 
students teach each other law. There is 
intimate and constant interaction at a 
school this small. Nobody makes an ap-
pointment with me. My door is open; if 
someone wants to chat, he comes right 
in. 
"I know how to work. I work hard. I 
live four minutes from here by Jeep and 
have a fine study. I enjoy the isolation 
of home. I don~t like to see visitors or 
take calls when I work, except for Yale 
law students. I want to talk to any Yale 
law student who wants to talk to me." 
Black considers himself "a fair pro-
fessor and a spotty lecturer," and the 
students in his lectures courses on con-
stitutional law and maritime law con-
cur. Students who have had him in 
seminars (he teaches two a term) say 
that he is much better in the informal, 
round-table format. 
On a shelf in Black's office sits a sad 
looking branch of a tree, made to look 
like a tree itself and adorned with over-
sized 
white baubles. 
David Black 
presented it to his father for Christmas 
many years ago, saying that he had 
made it himself. Like a good father, 
Black built a small showcase and placed 
it prominently in his office. 
"Of course, I had to build a showcase 
for the gift my daughter had given me, 
too, even though it didn't really need it." 
Her gift was an impression of her hands 
in clay, the kind everyone makes in 
kindergarten. "Years later I learned that 
David hadn't made the tree at all, but 
that his teacher had made it for him. I 
looked at the two showcases and 
reflected on how utterly unconnected 
are facts and love." 
Charles Black's mind is full of many 
ideas and of many different kinds of 
ideas, but they do not constitute clutter. 
Iceland and Ibsen, Pound and politics 
coexist harmoniously. He can drive a 
Jeep, read Greek, and play a harmonica 
with equal ease. He has spent his life 
sharing his ideas with others. Still, he 
has his regrets. 
"Everybody has loads of regrets. You 
never do as much as you like to or as 
much for people as you like to. I've cer-
tainly learned one thing from exper-
ience that I wish I had known much 
earlier. I regret things I didn't give 
away, but not a single thing I did give 
away."
