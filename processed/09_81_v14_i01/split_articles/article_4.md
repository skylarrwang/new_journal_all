Russell's term "the totalitarian look" 
could aptly be applied to Pelli's original 
design. But with the new music cam-
pus plan, said Project Designer Robert 
Charney, the "hodgepodge of architec-
tural styles" on the block will be saved. 
The plan preserves "sound buildings," 
and hence "the look of Yale," according 
to School of Music Dean Frank Tirro. 
Even the most drastic alterations-
relocating the admissions office and 
building a new music library-seem 
mild compared to the original proposal 
to construct one entirely new building. 
The new plan sits better with almost 
everybody, but it does nothing to 
remedy the fact that Yale's music com-
munity is alienating itself from the rest 
of the university. It would certainly not 
be the first time that architectural 
design and planning has sent shock 
waves shuddering throughout Yale's 
academic 
disciplines. 


Foremost 
m 
mind is the example set by Science 
Hill, a pretty spot atop Hillhouse 
Avenue where the natural sciences are 
grouped together. They now have 
ready access to each other- but, alas, 
to no one else. The resulting rift bet-
ween the sciences and the humanities 
has 
only 
accelerated 
an already 
noticeable drift at Yale away from the 
truly liberal education. Preprofessional 
specialization has reached a peak. Add 
to this the pressure exerted by graduate 
schools for their own building facilities, 
and the result is inevitable: Yale 
undergraduates are becoming a little 
more square and a little less well-
rounded. 


Not surprisingly. the School of 
Music is delighted with the plans for 
the new music campus. "One principal 
advantage," says Tirro, "is greater con-
tact between students and faculty. 
Another 
1s 
the convenience- if 
facilities are centrally located, there is 
an increase in their use." He is puzzled 
by the suggestion that a "music cam-
pus" might threaten, through increased 
specialization, Yale's traditionally in-
terwoven disciplines. "There are some 
people who subscribe to the virtue of 
[architectural] dispersion," he con-
cedes. "I don't think there's any real ad-
vantage to that in music. If you're 
dispersed there are people who never 
see each other." 


The spirit of centralized art lives on. 
Indeed, as things have tumbled and 
stumbled along now for almost a 
decade, it seems that the original plan 
for one large music building was aban-
doned for financial- not aesthetic-
reasons. 


The oil 
cr1s1s 
of the 
mid-1970s, according to Dean Tirro, 
"made that type of building not feasi-
ble" because of the prohibitive costs of 
heating it. Moreover, the initial capital 
outlay for the proposed music center 
would have been a hefty S7 .5 million, 
while current plans allow construction 
to proceed piecemeal, as funds trickle 
in. 


As Yale University evolves, it is 
caught again and again in an invisible 
tug-of-war between architectural 
"hodgepodge" and architectural 
specialization. Recent winners of the 
tug-of-war are Science Hill, the School 
of Organization and Management, 
and the Medical School. And it may be 
that they are the rightful winners. It 
lies beyond doubt that the School of 
Music needs-and deserves-far bet-
ter facilities than it has at present. But 
perhaps a moment of consideration-
or respect-should be paid to under-
graduates, who are gradually losing 
the relaxed interaction of disciplines 
that for so many generations has 
characterized a Yale education.
