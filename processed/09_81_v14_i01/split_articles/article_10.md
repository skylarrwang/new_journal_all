A longtime jan loolcs on. 
shouts of "Well rowed!" and "Jolly 
good!" that traditionally accompany the 
races. The first women to cross the 
finish line were Julia and Charlotte 
Geer, two sisters from Dartmouth who 
won their heat of the Double Sculls 
event. Though they would lose in the 
finals to a Canadian crew, the Geers 
had earned themselves a spot in history, 
for when their first heat ended, so did 
141 years of all-male rowing at Henley. 
It is Thursday July 2, 1981. The 
flagpole attendant glances nervously at 
his watch. Ten seconds before nine 
a.m. This is the first of the four days of 
Henley, and the affair is about to begin 
with characteristic precision. 

Nine 
o'clock, and the flagmen hoists the 
Union jack up the main flagpole in the 
Stewards' Enclosure. 
The Queen's 
Grenadier Guards strike up "Rule 
Britannia," and as the song ends, the 
P.A. crackles to life with progress 
reports from the first of the day's eighty 
races. Bentham Rowing Club of Lon-
don wins 
its heat of the 
Ladies 
Challenge Plate by default. Its oppo-
nent, the University of Natal from 
South Africa, has been disqualified for 
being two minutes late to the starting 
line. Thousands of miles travelled, the 
coxswain loses track of time, and the 
crew is disqualified. Ruthless precision, 
but necessary if all the races are to be 
squeezed in between a lunch hour, a tea 
hour and "God Save the Queen" at 7:30 
p.m. 

The lords and ladies and the well-to-
do swirl through the four days of the 
Regatta in the glossy fashion show 
known as the Stewards' Viewing 
Enclosure. Former oarsmen line the 
banks looking silly in gaudy blazers and 
school caps. Punts and small row boats 
line the booms of the race course to get 
a more intimate view of the competi-
tion. Vendors hawk the official pro-
grams, which are hurriedly printed in 
the wee hours of the morning to include 
all results and the next days schedule of 
races. 

This year, as in all others, there are 
surprises, big surprises. Yale's varsity 
heavyweight eight was looking forward 
to a rematch aginst the University of 
Washington, the crew they lost to in the 
San Diego Crew Classic. But the 
heavyweights fell victim in the first 
round of the Grand Challenge Cup to a 
strong Oxford crew. "Home Crews 
Triumph, â€¢ the Daily Tekgram pro-
claimed. 

Yale'sJV lightweight boat won easily 
in its first Thames Cup heat, but was 
outgunned in the next round by a larger 
and stronger British crew. Because 
there are no lightweight events at 
Henley, Yale's JV was up against 
heavyweight competition. The race that 
eliminated Yale was upstream into a 
headwind against a substantially bigger 
crew, and though the Elis held on for 
nearly a mile, the size advantage of the 
other crew allowed it to pull away in the 
last 500 yards. 

For a while, it looked as though 
Yale's heavyweight JV would be suc-
cessful in its Ladies Challenge Plate 
defense. But disaster struck in Sunday's 
final 
against 
the University of 
Washington's JV heavyweights. Yale 
had built up a three-quarters length 
lead by Fawley, but seconds later the 
bow man of the Yale boat was rendered 
ineffective when his seat broke and 
jammed. The Huskies caught up and 
moved ahead, and though Yale gallant-
ly challenged, the equipment failure 
proved too big an obstacle. Washington 
won by a half-length. 

The climax of the Regatta came just 
before tea on Sunday when the Oxford 
boat which had beaten Yale lined up 
against a boat from Leander and 
Tyrian Boat Clubs. Though it sounds 
like an ordinary race, all in attendance 
knew better. It was no ordinary Oxford 
boat. Five of the eight were from the 
Oxford crew that had easily defeated 
Cambridge earlier in the year. The 
other three oarsmen were members of 
England's siver medal-winning Olym-
pic Eight. But the Leander and Tyrian 
boat was even more formidable; this 
was the British National Heavyweight 
Crew, supposedly the best heavy-
weights in England, rowing under the 
colors of Leander and Tyrian. One 
could sense that a classic battle was at 
hand. The band fell silent, the careless 
banter subsided and spectators lined the 
banks of the Thames dozens deep as the 
grand Challenge began. 

After a furious start, Leander and 
Tyrian edged ahead, taking almost a 
third of a length by Fawley. The crowd 
rooted 
for 
Oxford, 
a 
primarily-
university crew with three Olympians 
that was up against a composite crew of 
Britain's best. A shame, a pity, "Nice 
try, Oxford!" the crowd said as Oxford 
lagged. But the magic of Henley 
asserted itself once again. Though ex-
hausted and behind, Oxford raised its 
pace, spurted and drew even. Coming 
into the view of the enclosures, Oxford 
had kept up the same torrid pace and 
had a third of a length on Leander and 
Tyrian. The national team tried to 
move back, but Oxford responded by 
sprinting even harder. At the win post, 
Oxford was half a length ahead, and the 
race fans were almost knocking each 
other into the river in excitement. 

Twenty-four hours later, on the same 
sight, scores of workmen were dissem-
bling the grandstands and enclosures so 
full of life a day before. The townsfolk 
of Henley breathed a collective sigh of 
relief, but were also proud of the fact 
that the greatest show in rowing had 
been held in their tiny community. It 
had been grandiose, thrilling, stylish, 
traditional and unforgettable. It had 
been, in other words, just another 
Henley.
