Kaplan 
Mike Kaplan and John Levenstein, the 
writers of the But Seriously Folks com-
edy revues, sat in Fitzwilly's last April, 
one month before their graduation. 
After producing five original comedy 
shows in the Silliman Dramatic Attic, 
and a two-act play in the Yale Dramat, 
the writers now planned to take six ac-
tors and a collection of their best 
material to a small west Hollywood· 
theater they rented for the summer. 
They said they were concerned about 
making the transition from college au-
diences to audiences in the real world. 
"We're kind of worried," Levenstein 
said. 

"I'm worried. I'm damned worried," 
Kaplan said. •aut I try to placate myself 
by saying I'm going to have a lot of fun 
this summer, which will be true. But 
I'm worried." 

Kaplan explained the purpose of the 
venture: "Basically there are people in 
L.A. and it's their job to look for talent 
and come see shows like this. And 
possibly someone's going to spot one of 
our performers or see our writing and 
figure that there's potential there and 
that they want to work with it. 

•u things don't go well by July," he 
joked, "we may be doing Wild Duck or 
something. But for the time being we 
intend to do comedy revues until the 
end of the summer." 

And after the summer? 
"Word processing." 

It's now five months since Kaplan 
and Levenstein sat in Fitzwilly's. They 
didn't end up word processing or per-
forming Wild Duck. Their show- Con-
uno for Stool and Bmch- ran for ten 
weekends in Hollywood. The Los Angeles 
Times called it "some of the best comedy 
revue writing we've seen in some 
seasons." 

"Careerwise, it really got me and 
Mike more than we could have ex-
pected," Levenstein said. The William 
Morris Agency signed them on as a 
writing team and Levenstein on as an 
actor. They've been meeting with pro-
ducers and discussing ideas, Kaplan 
said. Home Box Office has expressed 
interest in getting them to write for a 
new comedy show entitled "That Was 
the Month That Was." 

Levenstein, who peforms extensively 
in But Seriously Folks revues, was cast 
in the movie Cadds, a low-budget com-
edy about a military academy. Levens-
tein said he plays an •asshole cadet com-
mander. It's a good role in what pro-
mises to be a dumb movie." 

Kaplan and Levenstein first met at a 
Los Angeles Alumni Association get-
together for new Yalies. Surprisingly, 
they discussed starting a comedy troup 
at Yale at this first meeting. Even more 
surprising, they pulled it off. 

The show they performed in Los 
Angeles was a compilation of material 
from most of their previous revues. One 
skit, "America: An Intimate Docu-
mentary," provides 
survey of 
American history 
in 8 
minutes. 

Another, "Joke, Right?" is "a game 
show which 
matches completely 
humorless people against professional 
comedians." In another, Truman, At-
tlee, and Stalin have an encounter ses-
sion at Potsdam. 

They performed the show four nights 
a week, Thursday through Sunday, at 
the Shepard Theater Workshop on San-
ta Monica Boulevard in west Holly-
wood. Kaplan, Levenstein, and pro-
ducer Mark Rosenblatt ('81) rented the 
theater for about $2,000 each, almost all 
the money they had in the world. "I sold 
my baseball cards," Kaplan claimed. 

The Shepard is "small, charming, and 
seedy," as Kaplan put it. It was chosen 
for its run-down storefront look which is 
really very appropriate for the But 
Seriously Folks' visually-spare humor. 

The Shepard has ants in the bathroom, 
and, to make things lively, forty-nine 
seats from a defunct Elk's Club. The 
Elk's rows, not being attached to much 
of anything, offered new meaning to 
audience rapture; when the crowd rol-
licked, the seats teetered precariously. 

Six actors from Yale came west with 
Kaplan and Levenstein. Miguel-Angel 
Centeno ('80), Paul Frellick ('82), 
Michelle Granieri ('82), George Roth 
('82), and Lisa Willner ('81) had ap-
peared in the troupe's Yale shows, but 
Wallace Johnson ('82) was a new addi-
tion. All the actors volunteered their 
time, and the three investors had no ex-
pectations of making any profit. During 
the day, the But Seriously Folks worked 
as movie ushers, a secretary, a hospital 
orderly, and an executive for a market 
research firm. On performance nights, 
they arrived at the theater, turned on 
the popcorn machine, and stirred the 
lemonade for the evening's crowd. They 
painted the theater's marquis them-
selves, and producer Rosenblatt served 
as a one-man production crew. 

On opening night, Kaplan said, the 
house was packed and the audience en-
thusiastic. "For one night we felt like the 
darlings of Hollywood. Opening night 
got expectations way up. It made it dif-
ficult for the rest of the summer as 
things slowed down." 

The Los Angeles audiences were dif-
ferent from the college audiences, 
Levenstein said. "It was rare that 
something went over as well with nor-
mal people as it did with students." But 
the show certainly went over well with 
the L.A. Times critic who wrote, "They 
are contemporary in the freshest sense, 
highly literate and incisive .... " Var-
iety said the show "bulges with snap and 
sparkle and promise." 

The L.A. Weekly, however, didn't like 
what it saw: "This group is young, just 
out of their orthodontia, decent, ener-
getic, and entirely unbrilliant . . . It's 
all too clean-cut with not enough talent 
to match the toothpaste." Said Kaplan 
about the review, "I loved it. This was 
the first time we had ever moved 
someone to really hate us." 

The L.A. Times review by itself 
brought in decent-size audiences for 
most of the summer. They averaged 
about 30 people for each performance, 
Levenstein said. But "towards the end 
(of the summer] there wasn't quite as 
much spark to the show," he said. 

Originally, they plarmed to do a new 
revue in the middle of the summer but 
none of them had the time for rehear-
sals. 

They decided to close on Aug. 17, a 
week earlier than plarmed. Kaplan and 
Levenstein now have time to work on 
their first screenplay. "It's sort of an 
'1-hate-kids' movie,'" Levenstein said, 
but refused to divulge any of the jokes.
