~ The greatest show in rowing 
Sam Wilkins 
In every sport there is one event, one 
competition, which becomes synon-
ymous with excellence. Wimbledon 
means great tennis. Cyclists speak of 
the Tour de France with reverence· and 
awe. And in rowing, Britain's Henley 
Royal Regatta has no equal. 

Henley is not the largest regatta in 
the world; Boston's Head of the Charles 
is bigger. Nor is Henley the oldest; the 
Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race pre-
dates Henley by ten years. Nor is· 
Henley even the most competitive; 
Olympic and World Championship 
fields are far stronger. But for rowing 
enthusiasts, Henley is written in gilt 
script on the clouds because, where

tradition, character and prec1s1on are 
concerned, no other boat race and few 
other sporting events even come close. 

Henley is an unforgettable experience, 
more intoxicating than the bitters and 
stouts served in the public houses that 
dot the surrounding English coun-
tryside. Henley is not the oldest or the 
largest or the toughest regatta. It is 
simply the finest. 

The town of Henley-on-Thames 
hides in a small valley in the pictures-
que Chiltern hills about 30 miles west of 
London. The road from London to Ox-
ford descends out of a cool thick forest 
into the valley and across the River 
Thames. 

The town sits patiently on the west 
side of a thirteenth century bridge, 
waiting for the one week in early July 
when the tranquility of everyday life is 
shattered by the arrival of rowers who 
have come from around the world to do 
battle on the Henley Reach and thou-
sands of spectators who have come to 
observe the fray. 

The Henley course.is nothing short of 
flawless. Just above the Henley bridge 
is the longest straight stretch of water 
anywhere on the Thames, a mile-and-
one-half expanse of river that flows 
northeast from Henley before turning 
east to Windsor and London. At the top 
of this Henley Reach, as it is known, is

a small island on which rests a white 
marble medieval temple that is just 
barely visible from the bridge. The star-
ting line for Henley is just beyond the 
island, and ra~ progress one mile, 550 
yards (a distance unique to Henley and 
longer than the standard courses) 
upstream to a fmish a few hundred 
yards before the bridge. Crews race 
one-on-one up a narrow course lined 
with booms and freshly-painted marker 
posts, along pastures at first, then along 
farms and manors, and then finally in 
front of the main viewing enclosures as 
the duU roar of the crowd builds to a 
crescendo at the finish. The P .A. at 
Henley booms out times to places like 
"The Barrier" (a fence near an old abbey 
one-quarter of the way down the 
course) and •Fawley" (a manor house 
roughly halfway). This is part of the 
magic of H enley- it even has a lan-
guage all its own. Barrier, Fawley, 
Remenham Club, Phyllis Court Cro-
quet Club, Leander. 

AU racing is single elimination. If you 
win, you earn the right to face another 
crew on the next day. If you lose, you 
hit the pubs and enclosures to drown 
your sorrows in a big cup of PIMM's 
I 1. Th«; Stewards who run the race sent 
out a questionnaire in the early 1970s to 
representative crews from seventeen 
foreign countries, asking for possible 
changes in the format. Perhaps a double 
elimination or repechage system would 
be more appropriate, the Stewards sug-
gested. The seventeen forms were all 
returned blank. The message-leave 
H enley as it is, a one-of-a-kind racing 
experience. 

There are not any formal restrictions as 
to who may or may not enter at Henley. 
But since the Regatta is an international 
showcase for rowing and commands 
such respect in the sport, the application 
process 
i~ virtually self-regulating. 

M ediocre and less-than mediocre crews 
usually choose not to compete at 
H enley so as to spare themselves the 
embarrassment of losing by curvature 
of the earth in the opening round. 

Yale abides by this unspoken rule, 
allowing only its finest crews to go to 
H enley. But in 1981 this was no small 
contingent since Yale had, overall, the 
most successful college crew program in 
the country. The Yale team at Henley 
consisted of 40 oarsmen and their 
coaches, and Yale had entries in five of 
the Regatta's fourteen events. 

No crew deserved to be at Henley 
more than Yale's varsity heavyweight 
crew. Following a second-place finish in 
the San Diego Crew Classic, a pre-
season event for Yale, the varsity 
heavies finished the regular season un-
touched. They won the Eastern Sprints 
Title and assured themselves a place m 
Yale rowing history by becoming the 
first Eli varsity heavyweight boat in 18 
years to defeat Harvard in the armual 
and legendary four-mile race at Gale's 
Ferry in New London, CT. Henley was 
the natural next step. 

Yale's lightweight and heavyweight 
junior 
varsities 
had equally good 
reasons for going to Henley. The JV 
lights went undefeated, winning both 
the H -Y-P Regatta and the Eastern 
Championships for the first time since 
1953. Their win at the Easterns broke a 
14-year Harvard stranglehold on theJV 
lightweight Eastern crown. The JV 
heavies were also undefeated though 
disqualified at the Eastern Champion-
ships in a highly controversial ruling. 

Revenge for the disqualification came 
two weeks later when the crew an-
nihilated Harvard over three miles at 
Gales Ferry, winning by some five 
lengths of open water. 

The Yale heavyweightJV returned to 
Henley as in the Ladies Challenge 
Plate, trying for a second successful 
defense of that title. But the lightweights 
had gone to Henley only once since 
1953. 

This year's Henley was not only an 
important one for Yale. For the first 
time since the races began in 1837, 
women rowed the Henley course. The 
Stewards of the Regatta, a group of for-
ty men whose duty it is to preserve the 
traditions and uphold the integrity of 
the race, had previously decreed that 
•events for ladies are not in the best in-
terest of the Regatta.• The World 
Championships include women, the 
Olympics include women, but Henley 
has confmed ladies to the Stewards' 
Viewing Enclosure. 

The restrictions on women's rowing 
finally 
became 
too 
uncomfortably 
anachronistic even for a 
tradition-
conscious group like the Stewards, and 
this year, on an experimen tal basis, 
events for women were included. T he 
fLrSt women's crews to paddle past the 
grandstand in the Stewards' Enclosure 
on their way to the starting line drew 
titters and whispered comments from 
the ladies and gentlemen on shore. But 
when those same crews turned and 
raced upriver with style and power, the 
titters and whispers died in the throats 
of skeptics, and were replaced by the
