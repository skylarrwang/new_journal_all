What the DOD funds 
Much of the research conducted at Yale 
with DOD money seems to have little 
relation to war or weapons. All research 
at Yale is basic and unclassified. Results 
of DOD funded projects are published 
in scientific journals and are thus 
available to the general scientific com-
munity. 

Here is a sampler of some of the 
research being conducted at Yale with 
DOD funds. 

Artificial Intelligence 
Professor Roger Schank has been work-
ing on a particular computer program 
for over twelve years- one that could 
read and understand newspaper ar-
ticles, answer questions not explicitly 
cited in the text and, if necessary, 
translate it into ''pretty much any 
language you could ask for." Shank and 
his partner 
Steven Slade receive 
$340,000 from the Navy to conduct 
research to discover if computers could 
communicate with people in natural 
language. Slade said he and Schank got 
the money from the Navy because "the 
military has a great need for computer 
resources" to store their voluminous 
stock of information. "Natural language 
processing would make information 
more available and accessible to users," 
he said. 

Laser Beams 
R ichard Chang received $86,800 from 
the Air Force last year to develop a solid 
state laser that could be tuned to specific 
frequencies. Chang said his lasers do 
not have enough energy to blow up 
missles, nor could they be used to 
enrich isotopes for atomic weapons. But 
the Air Force is interested in his kind of 
research because it wishes to be in the 
forefront of all 
state-of-the-art 
technology, he said. The theoretical 
problems involved in making tunable 
lasers with solid state media are in-
teresting and important 
from an 
academic point of view, and successful 
work in the area could lead to applica-
tions in communications and other non-
military fields, Chang said. 

Mosquitos 
Walter Tabachnick, using a $29,712 
Army grant, supplies information to the 
Army's medical entomologists on 
genetic differences among mosquito 
varieties and how these differences af-
fect their ability to transmit diseases. 

· The Army, Tabachnick said, has no 
sinister aims in this work: "The people 
who I have met working with the Army 
at Fort Dietrich now-even though 
that's the old dirty tricks station-
they're doing very humanitarian things. 
"Fort Dietrich, Maryland," he ex-
plained, "is where the CIA was shut 
down several years ago. It's where they 
manufactured all these gimmicks to 
assassinate: . . . the 
~neil that was 
supposed to have leaked poison gas; 
boulinin in a Coke bottle. They're do-
ing very humanitarian things there 
now. It's been turned over and it's open-
ed up. They're working to develop vac-
cines." 

Electron Beams 
Ira Bernstein lays the theoretical 
groundwork for Jay Hirschfield's ap-
plied work on electron beams. They 
receive $72,517 for their research which 
has applications in communications and 
biomedical technology. It could also be 
instrumental some day in the develop-
ment of a controlled fusion reactor. 

Differences in human 
intelligence 
Robert Sternberg in the Psychology 
Department says the DOD did not pay 
him $97,626 to conjure up new techni-
ques of psychological warfare. Rather, 
he uses the money to study the causes 
and effects of the different levels of in-
telligence among individuals. The 
Navy could someday apply his findings 
to improve the learning potential of 
sailors but Sternberg said his work has 
just as much, if not more, relevance to 
improving the skills of underprivileged 
children or assistant professors at Yale. 

Game Theory 
Martin Shubik, economist in the 
Cowles foundation, has a $233,860 
grant with the Navy to carry on studies 
in his "Center for Competitive and 
Conflict Research." Shubik said his 
work applies to "general problems of 
stratetic analysis" in many kinds of con-
flict, military and non-military. Shubik 
and his associates at the center design 
what he calls "self-policing systems," 
games in which the players have dif-
ferent and often conflicting goals but in 
which their goals tend to make them 
obey the rules out of self interest. They 
hope to discover if it is possible to 
design systems in which it doesn't pay to 
. cheat. These scenarios could help the 
Navy devise incentive systems and 
determine the effectiveness of bargain 
bids and threats in different kinds of 
conflict. While most of this research has 
yet to be applied to specific problems, 
Shubik said he and his colleagues have 
answered some specific questions in the 
area of economic warfare. For instance, 
"Would another OPEC embargo dis-
rupt world financial markets?" and 
"Could we organize a counter-OPEC 
with, say, wheat?" The answer to ,both 
questions, Shubik said, is "probably not 
very effe<;tively."

Submarine sounds 
Zornig's underwater acoustics project, 
although unclassified, has extensive ap-
plications in the Navy's antisubmarine 
warfare program. The program is one 
of the Navy's highest priorities, one to 
which it currently devotes $17 billion a 
year, 16 per cent of its total budget. 
Zornig's work, currently funded by the 
National Science 
Foundation, was 
funded in past years by the Navy and, 
according to Zomig, will be funded by 
the Navy again next year if the NSF 
cuts it or if Reagan cuts the NSF. (lbe 
NSF, 
incidentally, 
received $1.7 
million from the DOD last year.) 
Zomig's project supplies information 
on how sound bounces around on the 
irregular surfaces of the ocean, infor-
mation which could help locate sub-
marines. At least two other projects at 
Yale contribute to the antisubmarine 
warfare program. Peter Schultheiss' 
$54,000 Navy contract, -"Tracking a 
Moving Source with an Array of Im-
perfectly Known Configuration," 
enables him to determine the accuracy 
and potential accuracy of various 
underwater sonar systems. 

Franz 
Tuteur is working this year on a 
$27,000 Air Force grant. One of the ap-
plications of this work, Tuteur said, is 
the refinement of submarine tracking 
methods. Specifically, it would help 
isolate the sound made by a particular 
moving source, such as a submarine, 
from extraneous noise in the water. 

If successful, acoustic methods to pin-
point underwater sound sources would 
transform the Russian submarine fleet 
from a set of well-hidden missile bases 
into a set of targets that appear as so 
many broad sides ofbams in the water. 
Available antisubmarine weapons, cur-
rently useless without clear targets, 
could then make short work of the 
underwater leg of the Soviet triad. 

Zornig acknowledges such a develop-
ment might undermine peace by upset-
ting the mutual invulnerability of sub-
marines on which deterrence depends. 
But the Russians plan to develop an an-
tisubmarine capability too, Zornig said, 
and we wouldn't want to risk getting 
caught with our pants down. This view 
conflicts, 
however, with that of a 
February 1981 Scientific American article 
which concluded that the Russians do 
not have an antisubmarine capability 
and are not likely to develop one soon. 

Unlike Zornig, Schultheiss says the 
possible military applications of his 
work do not concern him very much. In 
addition to military uses, he points out, 
his work could have applications in the 
location of schools of fish and offshore 
oil deposits. "'ne does not stay out of 
basic research because of what someone 
might do with it," he said. 

No strings attached? 
No matter who funds basic research, 
there is no guarantee that the military 
will not use its discoveries for warlike 
purposes. "You don't have a choice bet-
ween pursuing knowledge that will do 
society more or less good. Any 
knowledge can be used or misused at 
will," said Derek DeSolla Price, Avalon 
Professor of the History of Science, who 
has long been concerned with science 
policy. He argues that we cannot object 
to DOD involvement in university 
research as long as the DOD refrains 
from making concrete demands in 
return for its support. 

'"If the DOD-or the KKK or the 
PLO for that matter-happen to be 
wise enough, or foolish enough, to give 
us money to pursue knowledge with no 
further strings attached, we should take 
it," he said. "On the other hand, if the 
DOD or anybody else wishes to con-
tract with us for the delivery of a 
valuable good, whether that good be a 
new death ray-or even advice, where 
it is valuable advice- then the answer is 
somewhere between a flat no and · a 
cautious statement about the freedom of 
the individual to sell his research." 

Yet the DOD , unlike the NSF, is not 
in the business of supporting science for 
science's sake. Under the Mansfield 
Amendment, passed in 1970, the DOD 
cannot fund any research that does not 
have "a direct and apparent relationship 
to a specific military function or opera-
tion." 

The nature of the military's goals 
raises political and ethical questions· 
about research and development. Bruce 
R ussett, political science professor and 
nuclear strategy expert, said antisub-
marine research has an extremely 
harmful potential. In a crisis situation a 
U.S. antisubmarine capability would be 
"worrisome as much for what it might 
scare the Russians into doing as what is 
might tempt us to do," he said. In terms 
of "crisis stability," Russett said the 
U.S. antisubmarine effort "could be one 
of the most destabilizing kinds of 
research going." 

Laser research has also been criti-
cized by academics. At the January 
1981 meeting of the American Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Science, 
two physicists reported on the dangers 
of laser weapons and recommended that 
their development be stopped. 

R obert J . 
Lifton, 
professor of 
psychiatry at Yale Medical School, has 
done extensive research on the effects of 
nuclear war and written an award-
winning book on the survivors of 
H iroshima. H e says the threat of 
nuclear war is so great that researchers 
should refuse to do any work that could 
even remotely increase its chances. He 
cautions that justifying one's small role 
as a neutral one is dangerous contagion. 
"We delude ourselves to think our work 
is neutral," he said. 

Lifton urges scientists to reconsider 
the effects that their research could have 
on a politically unstable world. Resear-
chers, he says, "must consider the 
motives of the people who pay for their 
research and its possible consequences 
in the hands of those people." 

David Chappell, a history major in JE, is 
writing his smior essay on limited nuclear 
war.
