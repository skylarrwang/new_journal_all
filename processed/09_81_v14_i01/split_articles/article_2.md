With the federal budget signed into law, 
it is now clear that many students will 
not be able to obtain financial aid from 
the government next year. What re-
mains to be seen is how the cuts in aid 
will affect students and universities. 

Over the summer, Congress ap-
proved substantial reductions in two 
major federal aid programs, Guaran-
teed Student Loans, (GSL's) and Pell 
Grants. Approximately 25 per cent of 
the 6,000 Yale students expected to t~e 
out GSL's this year will be ineligible for 
future loans, 
said Donald Routh, 
University Financial Aid Director. If 
your family income is over $30,000, 
you will not receive further GSL's 
unless you pass a "needs test." Criteria 
will include the cost of the college you 
attend and the number of siblings you 
have also enrolled in school. 

Recent estimates indicate that a stu-
dent at a public institution with no 
brothers or sisters in college will prob-
ably be ineligible for a GSL if his family 
earns between $30,000 and $45,000. 
The same student attending a high-
priced private school may be eligible 
with a family income up to $60,000. 
Families with two children attending 
costly private schools may qualify for 
partial loans despite incomes of over 
$100,000. 

In the Pell Grant program, at least 
100 of the more than 800 Yale students 
currently receiving the grants will lose 
them under the new requirements, the 
Financial Aid Office said. Pell Grants 
fonn the basis of federal financial aid 
packages. In the past you might have 
received a Pell Grant if your family in-
come did not exceed $25,000; now you 
can probably expect no money if your 
family earns over $19,000. 

Since most students already received 
fmancial aid for this year under the old 
rules, it is difficult to assess the full im-
pact of the cutbacks. "The key question 
is: will educational decisions change?" 
wd a lobbyist with the Consortium for 
Higher Educaiton. "At the Yale level, 
the answer is 'no."' 

Small private liberal 
arts and 
religious colleges with largely middle in-
come students and little endowments 
will probably "feel the brunt" of the cuts, 
said Dallas· Martin, executive director 
of the National Association of Student 
Financial Aid Administrators. More 
· and more students will opt for less ex-
pensive public universities, ·community, 
and junior colleges, he sai~. 

But somehow students will manage to 
fmd the money to cover high tuition 
costs at the nation's most prestigious 
universities, most experts agree. Some 
students may choose less expensive in-
stitutions over Yale because of the aid 
reductions, 
but "not a 
significant 
number," said Yale's Budget Director 
Janet Ackerman. 

Ultimately the question of whether or 
not students of all incomes can continue 
to attend Yale may rest with the univer-
sity and its decision to fill in the gaps left 
by the federal aid cuts. For example, 
the recently instituted five percent 
origination fee on all GSL's will mean 
that even students whose aid packages 
appear to meet their financial needs in 
full will fmd themselves short $50 to 
$100. It may not sound like a lot, Routh 
said, but it could be significant to 
students attending Yale under severe 
financial constraints. "$90 buys a 
semester's books." 

Yale's administration is committed to 
continuing to provide financial aid 
packages that leave students with no 
unaccounted-for 
costs, R outh said . 
Unless the university reverses its policy 
of admissions without regard to need, 
this commitment is likely to cost at least 
several hundred thousand additional 
dollars next year. Both R outh and 
Ackerman insist that there has been no 
talk of revising the admi~ions pro-
cedure; instead the financial aid office 
will request a higher level of funding for 
next year. "I am assuming they (the ad-
ministration) will make every effort to 
provide the money," said Routh. 

At this point it is unclear where the 
university will find the extra money for 
fmancial aid. "It's not that the issue isn't 
being thought about," said Ackerman, 
but policy decisions will not be made 
until the Budget Committee meets this 
fall. One option is simply to raise tui-
tion more than usual. "Tuition may go 
up a little more. Maybe next year's will 
be up an extra $100," said Routh. 

The Budget Committee may also 
choose to compensate for additional aid 
costs by cutting back on programs and 
faculty. Or it may decide to dip into 
Yale's endowment in order to provide 
bigger grants or new jobs for students. 
Questions of which programs should 
receive more money and which should 
be cut certainly are not new to the 
Budget Committee. But this year's 
financial aid cuts may force it to make 
some particularly tough decisions. 

Since the Middle Income Student 
Assistance Act of 1978, Congress has 
offered government aid to an increasing 
number of students. With this aid 
abruptly cut off, Yale may have to re-
examine priorities which were estab-
lished when government money flowed 
more freely. 

The Reagan Administration claims 
that the student aid cuts were designed 
not only to reduce federal expenditures, 
but also to renew emphasis on the 
"traditional" roles of parents and 
students in paying for higher education. 
Families may have to borrow more 
money under a variety of relatively high 
cost loan programs available to parents. 

Three years ago, Yale introduced its 
own Parent Loan Program (PLP) 
which offers annual loans of $2,000 
-$7,000 at 12 per cent interest. Budget 
Director Ackerman anticipates a rise in
