**Music's new"home"**
**Author: Carol Lam**
**Page number(s): 5-6**

At first glance, the plans for a new 
music campus at Yale seem quite 
refreshing. Perhaps the most prevalent 
of the performing arts, music for years 
has been steadily growing at Yale 
without a proportional increase in new 
facilities. Deteriorating building condi-
tions are a major headache, but the 
real problem, Yale School of Music of-
ficials complain, is that music has no 
home; it is scattered throughout a 
number of buildings including Hen-
drie Hall, Stoeckel Hall, 140 Prospect 
Street, Sprague Hall, and 143 Elm 
Street. 

Now, after years of debate and fund-
raising, the university is beginning to 
construct a new "music campus" on the 
block bounded by Wall, College, Tem-
ple and Elm Streets. This year, the old 
Gothic undergraduate admissions buil-
ding will be converted into practice 
and teaching studios, while practice 
modules from the Prospect Street An-
nex will be moved to Hendrie Hall. In 
the next several years, the music school 
will build a new music library and 
recital hall. Then, determined to unite 
the hopelessly diverse architectural 
styles, the university will construct 
skylighted corridors linking all the 
music buildings. Music, at last, will 
have a home. 

But amidst the ensuing kudos and 
congratulations, there is something to 
be said for music's "homelessness"-
especially among Yale undergradu-
ates. From the rock band to the sym-
phony orchestra, the dormitory stereo 
to the electronic music studio, music 
penneates the width and breadth of 
Yale. Wherever it can, music grows 
and thrives, earning itself a reputation 
for hardiness by sprouting in the most 
unlikely places: college basements, 
cocktail parties- even 
in 
a 
little 
brownstone on Prospect Street, 
squeezed between the computer room 
and the engineering building. The om-
nipresence of music stands to suffer 
with the construction of the music 
campus. 

The roots of the new music campus 
can be traced back almost ten years to 
a time when public support for the arts 
was growing. Summer arts festivals 
were flourishing. New York's Lincoln 
Center for the Performing Arts, just 
over a decade old, was leading the way 
for the construction of the Kennedy 
Center in Washington, D.C., and 
Virginia's Wolftrap Park. Centralizing 
the performing arts was clearly the 
order of the day, as universities, public 
and private, were building their own 
monster arts complexes. 

Finally recognizing the need at Yale 
for relief from insufficient practice 
space, a cramped music library and 
makeshift rehearsal quarters, universi-
ty officials enlisted Cesar Pelli, dean of 
Yale's School of Architecture, to design 
new music facilities. He drafted plans 
for one massive building that would 
house almost all the activities of the 
Yale School of Music and the 
undergraduate music department. 

Yale's own arts monster-an impos-
ing, three-story glass building- would 
have consumed the Naples Pizza 
building and smacked its lips on the 
Silliman Annex for dessert. 

That original plan has now been 
abandoned in favor of a plan to 
renovate existing buildings, with sup-
plementary 
construction of small 
building connectors. The news is good. 
Even putting aside the issue of ar-
chitectural preservation, the prospect 
of an all-in-one music building was 
never very appealing. "Thomasjeffer-
son," notes architectural critic John 
Russell 
in the 
New York 
Times 
( 12/1 17 7), "very soon discarded the no-
tion that what he calls 'one immense 
building' could possibly make a good 
university." Russell himself adds, 
"What chills the blood in buildings of 
this sort is the all-of-a-pieceness-or, 
to be blunt, the totalitarian look."
