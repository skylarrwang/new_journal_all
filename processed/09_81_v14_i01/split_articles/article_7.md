I give, for one must give before M goes; from "Short Form Will," a poem by Charles Black

The Law School class of 1981 finished its class dinner and prepared to hear speeches by Charles and Barbara Black, two professors. *By the time we got around to speaking," Charles Black recalled recently, "they were in high spirits in every sense of the word." Mrs. Black took the floor first and began to deliver a dry, serious, soporific discourse. Five sentences into her speech, her husband pulled a harmonica from his pocket and, to the delight of the students, broke into song. The well-orchestrated incident set the tone for the couple's address. "At one point we read some lines from Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Black said. '"The students seemed to enjoy hearing me say things like 'poontang.'"


Acting is just one of the roles Charles Black plays. He is one of the foremost civil rights advocates of our time and one of the lawyers who worked on the historic desegregation case of Brown vs. Board of Education; he is also a painter, a poet, a student of Icelandic, a Sterling Law Professor, and a father. In his 25 years at Yale, he has written a shelf's worth of books, everything from a collection of poetry to an important book on the death penalty.


You'd expect someone like Black to have a cluttered office. He doesn't. His harmonica, for example, is in his bottom right-hand drawer. He plays a first-rate rendition of "Goodnight, Irene," and gives credit to Buck Green, *born and raised a slave, who still plays the harmonica through my mouth, having taught me when he was 75 years old and I was 10."


Surprisingly, it was music that led Black into the segregation fray in the 1950s. On October 12, 1931, he went with a "good old boy" from his Austin, Texas high school to a dance. The entertainment was "Louis Armstrong, King of Trumpet, and his Orchestra." Black knew nothing of jazz and did not recognize Armstrong's name. But for the first time, the 16 year-old Southern boy recognized a black man's genius.


Black's classmate, however, "shook his head . . . and pronounced the judgment of the time and place: 'After all, he's nothing but a God damn nigger!'"


Many years later, Black wrote about the incident in the Yale Law Review: "My good old boy did not await, perhaps fearing reply. He walked one way and I the other. Through many years now, I have felt that it was just then that I started walking toward the Brown case, where I belonged . . . Every person of decency in the South of those days must have had some doubts about racism, and I had mine even then -perhaps more than most others. But Louis opened my eyes wide and put me to a choice. Blacks, the saying went, were 'all right in their place.' What was the place of such a man, and of the people from which he sprung?


Black's early consuming interest in the plight of blacks did not immediately lead to his career in law. With a bachelor's degree in Greek and a master's degree in English literature, he was at a loss as to where to turn next. "What I can recall of my motivations at 25," he says, "is that I was convinced that my father would pay for me to attend law school and nothing else."


Although Black graduated from Yale Law School in 1943, he did not become profoundly interested in law until several years later, when the race problem began to surface and he began to see how the law could be used as a remedy. Black's first case, Swett vs. Painter, resulted in the admission of blacks to the University of Texas Law School and set him on his way.


Black said that his best civil rights work was for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, but that his role in Brown vs. Board of Education is exaggerated. "In Brown vs. Board of Education, I was one of 30 lawyers. I played a very small part. Everywhere I go people blow my role out of proportion. It was a profoundly cooperative effort." Black suggested one reason his role is exaggerated: "I was the only white gentile and the only Southerner who was a lawyer.


"It was a great case and I'm delighted to have been in it. Twenty years later, when another of the lawyers and I were in the same room, there was a current of feeling between us. You're not going to meet that feeling twice in your life. Still, I was not a tactician in that case."


Black's job in the Brown case was to study how to implement the decision, explains Jack Greenberg, a long time friend and colleague of Black's and now the director of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. "He was important to the civil rights fight then and in just a few years he became a central figure. He worked on briefs for many cases that ended up in the Supreme Court, and he was the author of not only the brief but of the idea in two of the most important cases we worked on, *Griffin vs. Maryland* and *Hamm vs. the City of Rock Hill, South Carolina*. " Black developed the so-called abatement argument, which invalidated the convictions of demonstrators jailed before the passage of the Civil Rights Act.


"'Charles Black is a giant of a legal thinker," Greenberg said. "There are only one or two others of whom I can say that. He is simply a monumental figure."


Twenty or thirty works of art-paintings, drawings, and sculpture-decorate Black's small office on the second floor of the Law School. They do not constitute clutter. Neatly arranged, abstracts hang harmoniously next to dreamlike landscapes and realistic portraits. A twenty-year-old doodle of Black's wife looks not at all out of place next to a colorful, lively abstract that may have taken weeks to finish.


"Most of my pictures I give away," he says in his gentlemanly Southern drawl. "My children have veto power over what I send to people. Most of these have been approved but not yet delivered.


"I paint because there is no law against art. I never stopped to consider why. For me it is just divine play, incredible fun." He was never trained as an artist and claims that he "can't draw at all" and is "unsuccessful." Yet his work is in demand; "The Admiralty Jurisdiction," a painting of a red and orange sun sinking below the ocean horizon, adorns the cover of *Owls Flying in Babylon*, the collection of his poems.


He is a much more serious poet than artist. "Poetry is where I live," he has said. Piles of poems sit neatly on a table in his office for law students to take. The poems are weighted by rocks. ("I love rocks; that the very same molecules have been in the same pattern for a billion years is a mind-boggling fact.")


Although Black studied poetry formally and did his master's thesis on Shelley as a translator of verse, he is a self-taught poet. His first collection, a thin volume that was two years in the making, is called *Telescopes and Islands* and came out in 1963. *Owls Flying in Babylon* was published last year. The 17 years that elapsed between his only two poetry collections must not be construed as a period of dormancy.


"I wrote about 800 poems between those two books," he said. His work is often published in literary and poetry journals for which he considers himself "extremely lucky. I send many poems to four or five magazines before they get printed. Some never get printed."


Not surprisingly, his talents in poetry are eclectic. Much of what he wrote between 1963 and 1980 he calls "light, frothy, personal, ephemeral, or just unpublishable," but the poems in *Owls Flying in Babylon* are much more reflective; they deal with such subjects as death, the forces of nature and fate.


Black admires Elliot and Pound, and said of Wallace Stevens, "I like his things but I have to confess I don't understand him very well. When I read Stevens, I get the feel of very fine poetry."


Drama is another of Black's passions, though not as consuming as art or poetry. In 1976 he decided that he would like to try his luck on the stage, so he called Robert Brustein, who was then in charge of the Yale Rep. Brustein put him in touch with the director of *Julius Caesar*, soon to show at the Rep. Black read for and earned the role of Cicero. "I had only seven and a half lines, but it was a great experience. I enjoyed it." In 1977 he understudied ten dinner guests in Henrik Ibsen's *The Wild Duck*, and portrayed five or six of them on stage.


His most recent foray into the world of drama was last spring, when he played Big Daddy in *Cat On a Hot Tin Roof*, a Theater Studies production that went up in Silliman. "That old southern character has many resonances with my life in the south," he said. "I'll be happy
