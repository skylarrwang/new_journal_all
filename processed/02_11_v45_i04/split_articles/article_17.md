Talese with his wife, Nan, and two dogs. 
bombing. People who had lived 
there for 30 years, whose children 
lived there, whose grandchildren 
may have lived there, were evicted. 
[The government said]: This bridge 
had to be built, this bridge was 
important, this bridge was going 
to do magnificent things by linking 
Brooklyn and Staten Island. But for 
8,000 people, it meant death to their 
homes, it meant the eradication of 
their neighborhood, it meant the 
severance of relationships. 


But that was just the 
beginning of the story. Because 
into 
this 
neighborhood, 
this pathway to the bridge that 
once would have been filled with 
homes, walked a whole new cast of 
characters—all kinds of hard hats 
and cement mixers. And I started 
following their stories. 


And then finally, over the 
next year or two, out of the water, 
out of the Narrows, which is part of 
the lower Hudson Bay area near the 
Statue of Liberty, came these struts 
of steel, came these barges carrying 
materials, came these people from 
faraway places: high aerial workers, 
people who build skyscrapers, 
people who build bridges, people 
who take chances in the air, who 
sometimes fall down and die but 
don’t even get an obituary because 
they’re nobodies in a way. 


But they’re somebodies to 
me. They’re like cathedral builders. 
Who built all those cathedrals you 
see on your junior year abroad? 
People like the bridge builders who 
cut the little rivets and link the steel. 
You can’t see them do it because 
they’re operating five hundred, 
six hundred feet above the water. 
Their names aren’t on the base 
of the bridge. But what they do is 
magnificent, and it’s there if you’re 
curious and you’re a writer. 


I kept in touch with a 
number of those people, and in 
2003, many, many years after that 
bridge was finished, I looked up the 
ones who were still alive. I learned 
for the first time that many of them 
went on to build the World Trade 
Center in ’65, ’66. And many of 
them, I’d say, that on September 11, 
2001, many of them were watching 
television and saw the work they’d 
spent three years doing crumble 
into ash between the sunrise and 
sunset of a single day. 


So 
I 
started 
talking 
to them about what it’s like to 
see such a thing, even if it’s on 
television, and they started telling 
me how embarrassed they were as 
construction workers when they 
worked on the building of the Twin 
Towers. They said that compared 
to the sturdiness of the bridge, the 
design was flimsy. In essence, the 
World Trade Centers were gilded 
birdcages. Glass birdcages. There 
was no real solid steel in there. 


But the point is, these old 
bridge-builders that I saw in their 
lively form back in 1962, ’63, ’64—
here in 2000, 2003—had a story. 


It’s the story of how 
different it was working on the 
towers than the bridge, which 
would have deflected the terrorists’ 
planes like a screen door deflecting 
a moth. But when the planes hit 
those birdcages, which were shoddy 
to begin with, flawed in their design, 
and avaricious in concept—they 
went down in a matter of six, seven 
hours. That’s a story. 
On 
the 
power 
of 
microcosms:
Stories can be small and big at the 
same time.
