In the garden of the English 
language, “root” is a word in fairly 
fresh soil. Though the word itself 
has a very long history, it came into 
our language only recently, brought 
by Vikings about 1000 years ago. 
The word “root” came into Old English from Old Norse, the 
language of the Vikings, as rot, with 
a long ‘o’ (/o/, roughly like the ‘o’ in 
Spanish burro).

Even 
before 
“root” 
was 
adopted into Old English, the 
language already had a form cognate 
(that is, a word originating from a 
common verbal ancestor) to rot—
the word wyrt. All of the Germanic 
words for plant/root descend from 
the 
Proto-Indo-European 
noun 
which can be simply rendered as 
*wrod or, in another form, *wrd, 
from which both rot and wyrt are 
ultimately derived.

Looking at spotted lungwort 
leaves, one might assume, falsely 
if justifiably, that “-wort” has 
something to do with “warts.” 
Actually, “-wort” comes from the 
aforementioned Old English wyrt, 
which means “plant.” Therefore 
“lungwort” literally means “lung-
plant” (it is the “lung” and not 
the “-wort” part that refers to the 
pattern on the leaves). 

A modern-day Swede or Dane 
might be able to tell you as much 
intuitively—in Swedish, one of 
the modern words for plant is ört, 
comparable to the Danish urt. Both 
come from an Old Norse urt. So, did 
Old Norse possess two cognates of 
the same root, rot and urt? Yes, but 
only in the same sense Old English possessed both rot and wyrt.
