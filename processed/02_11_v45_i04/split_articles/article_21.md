recalls a fondness for her mother’s 
empanadas and her father’s carne 
asada at family gatherings. Her 
mother, a devout Catholic, took her 
to mass every weekend and instilled 
in her the importance of faith.  She 
grew 
up 
with 
American culture as well. “I learned 
English from a purple dinosaur and 
my favorite food was chocolate chip 
cookies,” Serrano recalled. “I had 
a pretty happy, normal American 
childhood.”  Like other girls, she 
flirted in high school and had two-
week long crushes. She was an 
active dancer and held records in 
cross-country track. 
 “Although I grew up in 
an inner-city household and my 
parents juggled several low-wage 
jobs to provide for my brother and 
me, they were always there for us, 
and they made our education a 
priority,” Serrano said. 
Her 
high 
school 
in 
Dallas had a high drop-out rate, 
but Serrano beat the odds.  She 
excelled academically, ranking third 
in a graduating class of 250 and 
receiving the National Hispanic 
Scholar Award. Like the rest of her 
close friends, Teresa dreamed of 
attending college, and she applied 
to schools in Texas and on the 
East Coast. By her final year of 
high school, however, she realized 
she faced an obstacle her fellow 
classmates didn’t. 
“There was never a single 
light-bulb 
moment,” 
Serrano 
recalled about finding out she was 
undocumented. Growing up, she 
had a vague sense that her parents 
were in the process of legalizing their 
status, but until middle school, she 
believed she was born in the United 
States. 


In 
school, 
the 
fragments of Serrano’s complicated 
and broken immigration story 
began to come together. When she 
wanted to apply to get a driving 
license, her mother hastily changed 
the subject and wouldn’t let her. 
When she started applying to 
colleges and wanted to get a job to 
save for tuition, her parents said no. 
“That’s when it sort of 
dawned on me that I wasn’t a U.S. 
citizen,” Serrano said. “That’s when I 
began to realize the extent to which 
my life would be restricted and 
shaped by my status.” 

Yale University was among 
the list of colleges to which 
Serrano applied, identifying herself 
as an international student. She was 
admitted and offered full financial 
assistance even though she could not 
supply all the required documents 
to qualify her as a true international 
student. She is one of a small group 
of undocumented students admitted 
to Yale. 
“We admit students for 
their academic and personal promise 
without regard to ability to pay,” 
explains Jessie Hill, senior assistant 
director of Yale undergraduate 
admissions. “We admit a handful 
of undocumented students every 
year, and a student’s legal status 
does not factor into the admissions 
or 
financial 
aid 
decisions.” 

Undocumented students are able to 
secure financial aid based purely on 
their need; students whose parents 
earn below $60,000 a year can 
receive generous aid packages. 
This aid and additional 
private scholarships meant Serrano 
could pay the annual $50,000 for 
Yale tuition, but no amount of 
money could afford her the same 
Yale experience as many of her peers.
Yale 
provides 
ample 
opportunities 
for 
international 
travel, 
offering 
fellowships 
research in far-flung places, and 
summer 
programs 
around 
globe. Serrano would have loved to 
study abroad—but because she was 
undocumented, she didn’t have a 
passport. Carmen Alvarez, another 
undocumented Yalie from Peru, 
whose name has also been changed, 
agreed that travel was enticing but 
unattainable.  
 “The one thing that 
makes me so angry is when people 
pass up their opportunities to study 
abroad,” Alvarez said. “People don’t 
understand how much traveling is a 
privilege in this country until they 
are restricted from traveling home 
because of their status.” 

Serrano, who was unable 
to travel home to see her family 
in Texas during holiday breaks, 
agreed. 
“We 
religiously 
avoid 
airports and anything resembling a 
terminal because of the risk of being 
deported or getting caught up in an 
Immigration and Customs raid,” 
she said.  “The immobility that 
accompanies being undocumented 
can feel, at times, paralyzing.”


Instead, she spent all 
of her vacations and breaks in 
Connecticut, thousands of miles 
away from her loved ones. Her 
parents couldn’t visit her either: they 
faced the same difficulties traveling 
as undocumented persons and 
couldn’t afford to drive the 1,000 
miles from Texas to Connecticut. 
Serrano passed her summers in 
cheap sublet apartments, funded by 
odd jobs like babysitting and Yale 
psychology studies. 


During the school year, she 
studied anthropology and history. 
Outside of her academic career, 
she was a committed community 
activist for local nonprofits that 
lobbied for immigration and labor 
rights.
It was in those moments—
when she was working to protect 
locals and fight for a national 
cause—that Teresa fully appreciated 
being a Yale student.  
“Despite 
my 
looming 
status, my time at Yale was 
remarkable,” Serrano said. “I found 
numerous sources of support at 
Yale and, although challenging, 
my experience was full of positive 
growth.”


According to friends and 
past roommates, Teresa Serrano was 
not the type of person to wear her 
worry on her face. “She was always 
on top of things and was one of 
the happiest people that I have met 
during my time at Yale,” Elizabeth 
Gonzalez ’11 said. Gonzalez met 
Serrano before her freshman year at 
Cultural Connections, a University 
organized pre-orientation program. 
Additionally, Gonzalez has been 
a strong proponent and leader on 
campus for immigration rights 
through her work with La Mecha, 
a Chicano social justice student 
group.  She did not discover that 
Serrano was undocumented until 
the end of Serrano’s time at Yale. 
“People were attracted to her bubbly 
and cheerful spirit. You could have 
sat next to her and never realized all 
the issues she was going through.” 

Once 
Elizabeth 
knew, 
however, she was aware that the 
issues weighed heavily on her friend. 
Serrano worried relentlessly about 
her future during her senior year, 
Gonzalez recalled. 

The 
rich 
tradition 
of 
faith and prayer instilled by her 
mother sustained Serrano at first. 
“My mother’s answer to most of 
my questions in life was ‘Si Dios 
Quiere’—‘If God wants.’ For a 
long time, that was enough for 
me,” she said. But as she became 
increasingly disillusioned with her 
reality, Serrano found it difficult to 
maintain her faith. Confiding in 
friends about her status, however 
difficult, became a source of comfort 
instead. 

“One 
major 
challenges 
immigrants 
is 
overcoming the culture of silence 
that dominates and colors the lives 
and narratives of so many non 
citizens,” Serrano explains.  “So 
many of us are afraid to speak out for 
our basic rights. My parents simply 
avoided the subject for years, and I, 
in turn, inherited that same silence.” 

Due to the danger of deportation, 
few students will discuss their 
undocumented status with their 
peers. As a result, it is hard for Yale 
students to identify each other as 
undocumented. Serrano felt alone, 
though she knew she was not. 

By 
commencement 
May, Serrano had become 
increasingly 
despondent. 
inability to travel for job interviews 
meant many job applications sat 
incomplete on her desktop. With 
growing impatience, her mother 
insisted her best post-graduate job 
option was to become a nanny. 
Graduation is usually a 
joyous occasion, but for Serrano, it 
was a “heart-wrenching experience.” 
“What I felt on graduation 
day 
was 
different—something 
more severe,” she said. “I had spent 
the past four years at this elite 
institution, compartmentalizing a 
painful truth, and I knew that when 
I graduated I would be confronted 
with my harsh reality yet again.”

She left New Haven and 
returned to her home in Texas. Now 
her daily routine consists of nine-to-
five job shifts at fast food restaurants 
and laundromats, the advantages 
of her Yale degree negated by her 
undocumented status.

What comes next? 
“I 
try not to think about the 
future. I just live life day 
by day,” Serrano said, adding, “To 
live as an undocumented person 
in the U.S. is to grapple with daily 
exploitation, injustice, and broken 
promises.”


One such promise was 
the DREAM Act. The act proposed 
to grant conditional legal status 
to undocumented young people 
who have moved to the United 
States before age 16, lived here for 
more than five years, graduated 
completed 
three 
years of college or military service, 
and committed no felonies or no 
more than three misdemeanors. 
The acronym “DREAM” stands 
Development, 
Relief, 
and 
Education for Alien Minors. 

Yale University President 
Richard Levin publicly recognized 
and endorsed the DREAM Act 
on September 20, 2010. “In my 
view anyone who has the ability 
and determination to complete 
college is the kind of person we 
should welcome to stay in our 
great country,” Levin said at the 
time. “Like many others, I would 
prefer that the DREAM Act be 
considered as part of comprehensive 
immigration 
legislation.” 

the months after his statement, 
lawmakers and their constituents 
remained hotly divided on the issue. 
In Texas, where 37 percent of the 
population is of Hispanic origin, 
hunger strikes unfolded in San 
Antonio in support of the DREAM 
Act.


These and other protests 
failed to sway lawmakers, including 
Senators 
Kay 
Bailey 
(R-TX) 
Hutchinson and John Cornyn 
(R-TX). On December 8, the bill 
passed in the House, but a vote in 
the Senate was delayed. On Dec. 
18, the DREAM Act failed to pass 
again, after the Senate’s motion to 
prevent a filibuster of the bill fell 
short by five votes. 

After November’s election, 
Congress is more conservative on 
the issue of immigration than it has 
been in years past, but some state 
politicians are still holding out hope 
for reform. On January 25, New 
Haven’s 
aldermen 
unanimously 
recommended that the Connecticut 
state legislature pass a law making 
undocumented students eligible to 
pay in-state tuition at state colleges, 
a measure New Haven Mayor John 
DeStefano, Jr. also supports. New 
York, Illinois, California, Kansas, 
Nebraska, Texas, Utah, Washington, 
Wisconsin and New Mexico all have 
passed versions of this law, often 
called a “state DREAM Act.” 

Serrano’s 
post-graduate 
goal is neither to amass a fortune 
nor to start a family. It is simply 
to stay in the country in which she 
grew up. Her parents have been in 
legal proceedings to adjust their 
status for nearly 30 years.While her 
father recently secured legal status, 
her mother’s efforts have gone 
unrewarded. She cannot depend 
on her younger brother either; even 
when he turns 21, the necessary age 
to petition for a spouse or sibling, 
the process for Serrano would be 
backlogged for another 15 years. 

“Somewhere along the way 
in our historical trajectory of quotas 
and immigration rights, the system 
ran out of gas and broke down on 
the highway,” Karen Weinstock, an 
Atlanta-based immigration lawyer, 
said. “Even if you enter this country 
legally and file paperwork the ‘right 
way,’ it can take nearly 15-some-
odd years to be naturalized. That’s 
15 years regressing your life rather 
than progressing it.” Currently, 
the only way that undocumented 
immigrants can become U.S. citizens 
is through petitions by family 
members, company sponsorship, 
or re-adjustment of status through 
marriage. 

In his State of the Union 
address on January 25, President 
Barack 
Obama 
addressed 
problems with the nation’s current 
system for naturalizing foreign 
students educated in the United 
States. He had previously called 
the Senate’s failure to vote on 
the DREAM Act his “greatest 
disappointment.”

DREAM 
Act 
would 
have 
changed 
life drastically. She describes it 
as “the only hope for myself and 
for the hundreds of thousands of 
dreamers in the US, who have been 
deprived of basic human rights,” 
Serrano said.  ‘It’s physically and 
emotionally draining to discover 
the deep limitations that come with 
being undocumented and the few 
pathways and decades it can take to 
legalization. The system is broken, 
and we need smart, humane, 
comprehensive immigration reform 
immediately.”

Unlike 
other 
undocumented immigrants, Teresa’s 
brother’s citizenship and father’s 
permanent residency increase the 
chance she’ll be able to legalize her 
status. But, like many others, she 
remains in a compromising position, 
her name and status leaving her in 
danger of exile.

“The thought of detention 
and forced removal still sends 
shivers down my spine,” Serrano 
said. “It’s the ultimate nightmare—
to be detained without justice, to 
be permanently separated from 
your family and loved ones, to be 
banished to a country you have 
literally no memory of.” 

She is left with her hope, 
her perseverance, and her education.
