to China and see it?” Her lips move 
slowly and deliberately. Her right 
hand index finger draws a line from 
left to right under her collarbone 
and down her torso for “China,” 
and the middle finger joins in to 
gently touch the corner of her right 
eye for “see.” 

“No,” he mumbles.

“Why not?” 
A series of short sticky syllables. 

“What?”

“I want to be here.” Loud-
er and more clipped this time—he’s 
speaking. 

Driving me to the train 
station, Graesser confesses that de-
spite all her efforts, Z.T. seems un-
interested in his past.  

“I am still in frequent cor-
respondence with his British foster 
mom. I’ve asked him if he wants to 
talk to her. So far he said, ‘No, she’s 
old and she’s probably dead,’” she 
laughs. “She’s thirties maybe? She’s 
not old! I just don’t think he’s ready 
for it yet. Maybe he will be someday, 
but right now he’s not.”

A short silence ensues. “I 
don’t know if inside…Sometimes, I 
just think maybe I oversimplify him. 
I think, ‘Oh, he’s happy here, and 
he just wants that to be done,’ but 
then sometimes I wonder if he’s re-
ally trying to spare my feelings. He 
might think, ‘My new mom prob-
ably wouldn’t like it if I talk to my 
old mom.’” Her loud, clear voice 
now shakes with uncertainty. 

“I don’t know. I can’t place 
emotions on him. He’s hard to 
read.”

Penelope is the newest addition 
to the Nicoloso-Heller family, 
which includes five adopted girls, 
eight rescued bunnies, and a rescued 
fish. Kathleen Heller is their mother, 
and a friend of Grasser’s. Two of the 
girls, who are twins, were adopted at 
birth, while the other three joined 
the family between the ages of 11 
and 13.

The New Journal
Blossoms from China,” Heller re-
cords the hustle and bustle in her 
household. 

One day Heller blogged 
about finding Penelope sobbing in-
cessantly under a bed cover. Guess-
ing that she had upset the young girl 
when she reprimanded her for stay-
ing on the computer, Heller tried to 
soothe her with apologies and en-
couraged her to communicate. 

“It’s important to talk 
about what’s making you sad. Keep-
ing it in doesn’t make it go away…
We’ve only known you for several 
months and sharing is a way for us 
to know more about you so we can 
be more supportive,” she recalls tell-
ing her daughter.

Her efforts only elicited 
more tears, and Penelope responded 
with a stubborn “Nothing.” In the 
end, Heller realized that was what 
she had to settle for.

“Well, guess what?” she 
wrote on her blog. “All that, ‘I’m 
making a breakthrough, I’m really 
reaching her, and whoa I’m really 
saying the right things...’ was bo-
gus.  It WAS nothing.  She was just 
very tired and it turns out she be-
comes overly sensitive when she is 
tired.  Hmmmmmmmm, guess the 
only thing I learned from this is—
she becomes sensitive when she’s 
tired.” 

Before I visit Heller’s fami-
ly, I expected a reserved, perhaps sul-
len face from Penelope. I scrutinize 
my prepared questions on the train 
to their house, picking each word 
with painstaking caution.

James Nicoloso, Heller’s 
husband, picks me up at the Red-
ding, Connecticut, train station. As 
the car winds through woods hills 
and fields, Nicoloso tells me that he 
works as an independent filmmaker. 
He is currenly making a film about 
Mark Twain, who spent his last years 
in Redding. The task of taking care 
of the girls is mostly his wife’s. 
CASPY participants share snacks while enjoying the 
sun and making chalk drawings and messages.

The 
Nicoloso-Heller 
house, situated amid December’s 
bare woods in Redding, Connecti-
cut, glows a warm yellow light at 
its windows. Penelope waits for 
me at the living room table, where 
she remains for the entirety of my 
half-day visit. Her face, tanned and 
heart-shaped in blog photos, has 
been bleached by life indoors and 
fleshed out by a year of American 
diet.

Her two youngest sisters, 
Juliette and Leigha, ten-year-old 
twins who were adopted at birth, 
have black, silky hair that falls to 
their waists. After running circles 
around the living room table, they 
sprint toward the trampoline in 
their backyard, their giggles echo-
ing from afar. Marielle, the oldest 
daughter at 16, was adopted four 
years ago. She rambles in a mix of 
Chinese and English while showing 
me her drawings of Japanese manga 
characters. Aleena, age 12, joined 
the family at the same time as Pe-
nelope in February 2010. Hard of 
hearing, she attends a deaf school, 
where she became close friends with 
the Graessers’ son, Z.T. 

Penelope completed ninth 
grade in China. When she arrived 
at Heller and Nicoloso’s home, she 
was placed two years back in eighth 
grade at the nearby John Read 
Middle School. She was expected 
to catch up within half a year and 
transit smoothly into high school. 
Instead, Penelope returned from 
school crying every day. Her teach-
ers’ speeches in English were all gib-
berish to her. 

Worried, Heller made re-
peated requests to the school’s ad-
ministration, asking for a special 
language teacher for her daughter, 
but received no answer.  

“You know what the reac-
tion was? ‘Oh, she hangs out with 
her friends. She will learn English.’ 
She is in a new country. She doesn’t 
have any friends. She is very shy. ‘Oh 
she will learn. We will assign some-
body to hang out with her.’ No. 
That’s not how you teach a child.”

In May, Heller filed a com-
plaint against the school in the dis-
trict government. A few days after 
my visit, she announced the result 
on her blog: “We have won! I am 
so excited…She will get support in 
all of her classes and have a separate 
time for tutoring.”

When she’s not at school, 
Penelope spends most of her time at 
home, chatting online with friends 
from China. Many of them have 
also been adopted by families on the 
East Coast.  

Having lived with other 
children in a “welfare institute” in 
China for five years, Penelope ex-
perienced a teenager’s life before 
she came to America. She and her 
friends chased each other on their 
way to school, collaborated on 
homework after class, and huddled 
in the institute’s heatless common 
room to watch television soap opera 
on weekend afternoons. Before that, 
she had even had a family. 
“Could you help me with some-
thing?”  Heller asks me after 
lunch, taking a pile of large yellow 
envelopes stuffed with paper docu-
ments off a shelf: Penelope’s records 
from the years she lived with her 
grandmother in the countryside, 
before she entered the welfare insti-
tute. “If we can somehow locate the 
town where she lived, we can find 
her grandmother!”  Heller says, her 
eyes sparkling.

As I sift through the docu-
ments, Penelope’s past gradually 
emerges. Her father died in a coal 
mining accident more than ten years 
ago and her mother succumbed to 
an “unspecified illness.” Brought up 
by her grandmother, she lived in 
the countryside of central China’s 
Henan province until she turned 
9, when her grandmother grew too 
weak to support her. One day, a car 
came to take her to a welfare insti-
tute in Luoyang, the capital of the 
province. By now she has forgotten 
the name of the town she lived in 
and the elementary school she at-
tended, and she has not seen her 
grandmother since leaving Luoyang. 

“Do you want to see her 
again if we find her?” I ask.

She stares at the table and 
nods slowly.

On a guardianship trans-
fer approval form, the seal of the 
local public security bureau states 
“Wangfanhuizu County.” Wang-
fanhuizu could be a translation of 
any number of Chinese names. I do 
several Google searches on the Hell-
ers’ computer while Kathleen and 
Penelope stand behind me, eager 
to see what I find. Christmas music 
blares from the television in the liv-
ing room.

“Aha!” On the sixth or the 
seventh try, Google yields several 
hundreds of results, generously tum-
bling down the page, and the next, 
“For you and me, we go 
back to New Jersey, I 
drive around and could 
remember it all,” says 
Carl Graesser. “For 
him, he won’t have that 
opportunity.  We are not 
doing it for us; we are 
doing it for him.”
