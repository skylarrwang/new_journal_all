11 is our 61; 111 is 3661. The 
Babylonians also used this system 
for astronomical calculations, which 
is why we still have 60 seconds in a 
minute and 3,600 in an hour. When 
historians 
translate 
Babylonian 
numbers, they separate each digit 
with commas to avoid confusion, so 
that 1,10 is 70, just as 1:10 a.m. is 70 
minutes past midnight.)
With 
such 
a 
complicated 
numerical system, learning your 
times tables took dedication. The 
largest tablet on display at ISAW, 
also part of Yale’s collection, was 
a multiplication table, about 10” x 
8”. “We think they learned them 
all,” says Melville. “There was a set 
of 40 multiplication tables you had 
to learn, and you practiced them. 
People in the ancient Near East 
had what seem to us prodigious 
memories.”

Four millennia ago in northern 
Mesopotamia, 
archeologists 
speculate, a young Babylonian was 
practicing geometry. One problem 
required finding the length of the 
diagonal of a square. Taking his 
circular tablet of damp clay in one 
hand and his favorite reed in the 
other, he copied down the exercise, 
sketching out a diagram of a square 
with a few hasty strokes. He wrote 
the square root of two along one 
diagonal, multiplied by the side 
length, and scrawled the solution 
across the clay.

Having lain in the sand for a 
little under four thousand years, his 
discarded assignment is now part 
of the Yale Babylonian Collection: 
the oldest extant record of an 
approximation of the square root 
of two. The young scribe’s work 
became the centerpiece of “Before 
Pythagoras: The Culture of Old 
Babylonian Mathematics,” a recent 
exhibit at the Institute for the Study 
of the Ancient World at New York 
University.

The student may have been 
just applying a formula he learned 
in school. There’s no proof he 
understood why multiplying a side 
length by root two gave the length 
of the diagonal. But his tablet is 
evidence that mathematicians in 
the Old Babylonian Period (2000-
1600 B.C.E.) knew what we call the 
Pythagorean Theorem more than 
a millennium before Pythagoras 
taught in Athens. The approximation 
this Babylonian scribe used differs 
from the actual value of root two by 
only 0.0000006.

The exercise is “particularly 
cute,” 
says 
Duncan 
Melville, 
a professor of the history of 
mathematics 
at 
St. 
Lawrence 
University. “It’s particularly easy.” 
That is, if you can read cuneiform 
base-60 
notation. 
(Babylonian 

The multiplication tables, in 
short, were of epic length. And if the 
system Babylonian mathematicians 
used to calculate square roots was 
as unwieldy as the 480-pound sword 
Gilgamesh used to slay Humbaba, it 
was also just as effective.

To divide, they multiplied 
by reciprocals. Melville calls this 
exercise “cute” because the side 
of the square on this tablet is 30 
units long. That’s Babylonian for 
one-half—they had no equivalent 
of a decimal point—so when you 
multiply the side by root two, the 
length of the diagonal is just the 
reciprocal of root two. See how that 
comes out? Easy.

The exhibit at ISAW received an 
enthusiastic response. The museum 
had planned to close the exhibit on 
December 17, but, due to demand, 
it was extended another month. 
CNN and The New York Times both 
interviewed Melville about it. Alice 
Slotsky, a colleague of Melville’s 
who lives in Providence, Rhode 
Island, told me, “A lot of people do 
Babylonian astronomy. Not many 
do math and do it correctly. As far 
as I’m concerned, he’s the master.” 
“It’s great,” Melville told me. 
“It’s an obscure field that’s not on 
people’s radar very often.”

Melissa Dallal and Tracy White 
visited the exhibit for Dallal’s 
birthday. Dallal’s parents, she said, 
are Jews from northern Iraq, so 
she’s taken an interest in Babylonian 
history. “It just makes me wish I 
understood math to begin with,” 
White told me.

NYU 
Provost 
David 
McLaughlin was also curious to see 
the exhibit. “It’s striking, the age 
of the materials,” he said to me. “I 
didn’t appreciate how much math 
was known then.”

Babylonian math looks very 
familiar. A multipart word problem 
from one tablet suggests a pre-
algebra textbook from a Babylonian 
junior high school: “A canal’s length 
is five us, its width is three cubits, 
its depth is 3 cubits. A worker’s daily 
load of earth is 10 gin. A worker’s 
daily wages are 6 se of silver. What 
is the canal’s surface area, its volume, 
the number of workers needed to 
dig it, and the total cost in silver?”

Other tablets involve more 
theoretical math. One is a list of 
Pythagorean triples—the lengths 
of sides of various right triangles. 
Others list problems that the ancient 
Babylonians lacked the techniques 
to solve—evidence of mathematical 
research.

“The 
abstraction 
of 
the 
concept of number, that takes a 
long time to develop,” said Melville. 
There 
are 
centuries 
between 
adding goats and cattle in the 
sand and approximating quadratic 
roots. Because the Babylonians 
used clay, historians can chart the 
development of their mathematical 
system from everyday arithmetic 
to the most theoretical exercises, 
explained Melville. Other societies’ 
writing 
materials—papyrus, 
for 
example—have decayed over the 
centuries.

 “What you see on a social 
level is very similar to what you see 
with children: dealing concretely 
with blocks and bricks and things, 
moving gradually to manipulating 
abstract numbers,” he added.

The 
numbers 
themselves, 
though, have not changed meaning 
since Babylonian times. Root two 
means exactly the same thing today 
as it did to the young man who wrote 
it down. So while Yale’s tablet is 
nothing more than a rough diagram 
of a square and a few numbers 
scribbled in cuneiform, it offers an 
unobstructed view into an ancient 
mind. It can be difficult to imagine 
what life must have been like for the 
Babylonians, but it isn’t hard to look 
at the square root of two on that 
crumbling piece of clay and imagine 
holding the tablet, its grooves still 
crisp, its base slightly warm from the 
palm of a classmate’s hand.
