The invention of root beer 
predates 
our 
nation. 
Native 
American warriors during the French 
and Indian War carried sugar and 
ginger to flavor their water. Hardy 
White Mountain backwoodsmen 
sustained themselves with maple 
sap boiled with spruce twigs. Even 
250 years later, the recipe isn’t too 
different. At Foxon Park, a small 
family-owned soda manufacturer in 
East Haven, the Naclerio family has 
combined syrup with sugar, water, 
preservatives, and carbon dioxide in 
the same formula they’ve used since 
1928. 

Foxon Park’s customers are 
loyal. Locals grow up eating apizza 
and drinking Foxon Park in Wooster 
Square. Coca-Cola Co. has come 
sniffing around their turf, their 
pubs, and their production facility 
a few times, explains Jay Brancati, 
manager of daily operations and 
an in-law of the Naclerios, but the 
people of New Haven know what 
they will drink. He adds, bemusedly, 
that Foxon Park often recieves fan 
mail—love letters, truly. “I drive 
down the road and people scream 
and give me the thumbs-up.” 
Brancati shakes his head. “I don’t 
know why people get so worked up 
about it—it’s just soda.” 

People love root beer partly 
for its flavor, but also for the 
impressions it evokes. Foxon Park 
operates on this emotional power—
its sodas taste of the past. But is it 
possible for us, in sipping an earth 
brew, to tap into the collective 
memory of the past, to think back 
beyond our own experiences? Can 
we drink in the history of our worn 
northeastern mountains and the 
bright chill of facing a new land?

Foxon Park operates out of two 
small warehouses. Dressed mostly in 
navy Foxon Park sweatsuits, seven 
men work there, loading cases and 
ducking around bottling machines. 
Foxon Park began with the 
freshwater spring that still flows out 
back. There, in 1922, Jay Brancati’s 
great-grandfather-in-law, 
Matteo 
Naclerio, founded a mineral water 
company that became the soda 
brand in 1928. Brancati and his men 
still use the spring to bottle Foxon’s 
17 flavors of soda, which include 
the root beer and best-selling white 
birch beer, sold in glass twist-top 
bottles. The company belongs to 
the family and they work hard to 
make sure it stays that way. “I’m 
working every day like a schmuck, 
just trying to keep it going for our 
children’s children,” Brancati told 
me in the upstairs office, next to his
