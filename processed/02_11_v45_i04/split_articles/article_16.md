**Title: SNAPSHOT A Talk with Gay Talese**
**Author: Joyce Tenneson**
**Page number(s): 12**

Gay 
Talese 
is 
widely 
recognized as a pioneer of literary 
nonfiction, a journalistic genre that uses 
artful writing to tell factually accurate 
narratives, the same type of journalism 
we publish in The New Journal. 


Earlier this year, one New 
Journal editor in Anne Fadiman’s 
nonfiction class was lucky enough to 
listen to Talese speak. Since our words 
cannot do justice to how Talese has 
shaped the field of literary journalism, 
we’ll let his speak for themselves.
On nonfiction storytelling 
and history:


You should never deviate 
from the facts. You should never 
use your imagination just because 
you want to fill in the spaces to 
make a better story. But even if 
you adhere to the traditions of 
serious nonfiction, you can still be 
a storyteller. Nonfiction is art, but it 
also has a reference point in history. 
You don’t have to write about 
Lincoln to be a historian. You can 
write about obscure people and be 
a historian, because obscure people 
still represent their time. 
On note-taking: 


Instead of a notepad, I use 
shirt boards from the dry cleaner. 
I take a shirt board, and then I get 
scissors and cut it into note cards that 
I use like a notepad. I should patent 
the idea. I usually don’t take notes in 
front of my subjects; I sneak off and 
jot down things on these cards. They 
fit in my suit and don’t stick out like 
the wires on stupid little journalism 
pads.


On persistence:


Sometimes I go over the 
same damn sentence or the same 
paragraph five dozen times. I start 
writing in pencil, and then I go to 
a typewriter and type it over. I just 
do it again and again, and finally, 
finally I say, this is about as good 
as I’m going to do. And then I 
go to the next thing, and that’s it.  
There’s no limit on the time I will 
spend.  
On following up (theory):


If you’re a typical journalist, 
one who thinks in terms of a single 
day, you don’t follow up because 
you’ve done the story. I always want 
to do a follow-up because there 
is a continuation. What seemed 
relevant when you first interviewed 
them might cease to be relevant, but 
they move on, they get older, they 
lose their jobs, they get voted out 
of office, they get dismissed from 
the baseball team. Whatever it is—
they’re still alive, and they still have 
something to say.


No matter who you’re 
writing about, their stories are not 
going to finish because you’ve 
finished them. If you want to keep 
them alive, you can go back, and 
back, and back, and back. And if you 
do that artfully enough, you’re doing 
something creative.
On following up (praxis): 


In 1964, I published a book 
called The Bridge about the building 
of a bridge between Brooklyn and 
Staten Island called the Verrazano-
Narrows. I spent the better part of 
three years doing it. In 1960, the 
first stage began with the eviction 
of 8,000 people in Brooklyn whose 
stores or homes happened to be in 
the pathway to this new bridge. So 
these people were driven out of 
a section of Brooklyn called Bay 
Ridge, and I wrote about that. 


It was like a war. Like a
