The New Journal
I’m usually taking care of everybody 
else.” 

It’s warm enough inside for men 
to pull off Champion sweatshirts, 
roughened work vests, and Italian 
suits.  Some go all the way down to 
undershirts, revealing gold chains 
and Catholic icons suspended in 
chest hair. 

In barbershops, men drop 
their defenses.  
An apron arrests their 
limbs, clippers cut close to their 
throats, and they sit face-to-mirror 
with their barber. He asks questions, 
he touches them with his hands, 
he listens. They don’t have much 
alternative. “Everything homemade 
is better,” says Mastroianni, “except 
haircuts.” 

Men have feared and 
venerated 
barbers 
throughout 
history, as if with scissors and 
shaving cream barbers could take 
apart or put together one person 
or an entire political community. 

In Mastroianni’s birthplace, an 
ancient tyrant allowed only his 
daughters to shave him.  When they 
got older, he mistrusted even their 
hands with a blade and made them 
burn off his five o’clock shadow 
with blistering hazelnuts. Another 
emperor worried that barbers might 
cut away his popular support.  With 
dissent spreading in barbershops, he 
banned all barbers from Rome. 

In Mastroianni’s adopted 
home, barbershops are part of 
democracy, or so it goes. In the 
American barbershop, all men (no 
women here)—some with dry hair 
and some with wet, some seated 
in heavy green chairs and others 
waiting in delicate pink ones—
become equal, and the opinions 
they express carry equal weight. It 
is a place where a community can 
form shared beliefs. Wisconsin 
Governor Warren Knowles told 
Dick Cheney in 1966 that a good 
campaign should visit three places 
in every town: the Republican Party 
Office, the newspaper, and the local 
barbershop.

Mastroianni has cut hair 
for so long that those with whom 
he once talked politics have become 
the talk of town. Joe Lieberman 
’64 LAW ’67 was Mastroianni’s 
customer for 10 years, when he 
had just finished at the Yale Law 
School and was working for a firm 
in New Haven.  Lieberman was, 
as Mastroianni puts it, “destinated 
[sic] to become a politician.” He 
was special because he could talk to 
anybody, “anybody like me.”  
But 
when 
Lieberman 
became attorney general and then 
senator, his blonde hair became 
gray, and he stopped sitting where 
Mastroianni could reach him.  

Today, 
the 
barbershop 
democracy governs less. Political 
campaigns—including 
Dick 
Cheney’s 2000 and 2004 vice-
presidential 
campaigns 
on 
Republican 
ticket—visit 
more 
Internet blogs than barber chairs. 
And while Richard Blumenthal 
was attorney general, Mastroianni’s 
best access to him was through 
a staff lawyer, who reported that 
Blumenthal’s 
senate 
campaign 
became so broke its managers were 
making fliers on personal printers 
(no $Buck$ is right).  

Mastroianni himself has 
gotten slower and quieter in his 
shuffles around the barber chair. 
He knows he has nothing to gain 
by changing a customer’s opinion, 
only business to lose.  He used to be 
insistent and center-right.  Now he’s 
on the left, but you wouldn’t know 
it. Mastroianni works around his 
customers. They sit in the center.

Even a careful eye can’t pick 
out Mastroianni in a picture from 
his 1967 return to styling school. 
“It’s im-pos-si-ble! I was a different 
man.”  He was there learning to cope 
with long hair and left-wing politics, 
both of which put a lot of other 
barbers out of business—the kids 
just weren’t coming in for the JFK 
cut.  A decade later, Mastroianni 
learned never to hang political 
posters in his barbershop.  When he 
promoted mayoral challenger Ben 
DeLieto in 1977, customers who 
supported the incumbent protested, 
and all his customers got more city 
parking tickets for parking near 
opposition sidewalk signs.  “People 
don’t want opinions,” he says. “They 
want haircuts.” 

Shared opinions in the 
barbershop might be impotent 
to change policy, anyway.  Most 
of Mastroianni’s customers have 
moved out of the city and cast their 
ballots in suburbs like Woodbridge 
and Orange. 

“I see the reason,” says 
Mastroianni. “You’re working like 
a dog all your life, you’re trying to 
make something.  All of a sudden 
you’ve got a beautiful place, nice 
school system, and it changes.  The

property goes down, the school 
system goes down.  So what do you 
do?  You run! If you got wings, you 
run.”  

Now it doesn’t matter 
whose side the barber is on, if it 
ever did.  People, or at least politics, 
won’t be changed by Mastroianni’s 
opinions.  But people don’t come 
to him to be convinced what to do; 
they come to be consoled about 
what they no longer can.	

“H
ow ya doin’, John?” 
“Just barely treading water.”
BaZRRRR.  The clipper 
and the din of the double-cassette 
radio excuse Mastroianni while he 
comes up with a question. What 
the customer needs to express isn’t 
always clear, but each will soon say 
what he must.  Mastroianni’s silence 
lets his customers speak, and his 
simple affirmations encourage them 
to say more. 

Mastroianni asks a man 
with sparse brown hair about his 
brother’s pitbulls, and the man soon 
opens up about his brother’s drug 
problems.  Marucci, also a practiced 
listener, asks a near-bald father 
about a son’s bachelor’s party.  After 
telling what the strippers “made me 
do” (“Oh, they made you!”), the 
father talks disapprovingly of his 
future daughter-in-law.  

Sometimes, the barbers 
help the men retreat into their pasts. 
There are the war stories of Robert 
Wallick, who discovered Amelia 
Earhart’s briefcase; Jim Vaneris, 
who flew the Memphis Bell with 
his best friend from Tennessee; or 
Jeffrey Somner, who ran into an 
assistant barber drafted out of the 
Marucci’s old barbershop at Basic 
Training in Camp Grant, Illinois, 
and got his hair cut.  

There are games that 
must be ritualistically replayed. 
One customer reckons with his 
mistakes on the field when Yale 
lost to Harvard, 29-29. A hulking 
man relives tackles he made in high 
school as Mastroianni cuts his bangs, 
and his shadow head-butting nearly 
brings his eyes into contact with very 
real shears.  But Mastroianni doesn’t 
let that happen. He rarely brings his 
customers back to reality, unless they 
want to bring themselves.  In this 
case, disability distorts the former 
football player’s sense of proportion, 
and once Mastroianni has washed 
the man’s head (an uncommon rite 
brought to an end with “Up, Sir!”), 
Mastroianni helps him identify the 
cut wet hair that has fallen onto his 
tongue. “Brown? Then it must be 
yours!” 

Mastroianni may be a born 
listener, or perhaps just a too-busy 
barber. Tufts and curls take so much 
attention that Mastroianni must ask 
more questions than he answers. 
And when he’s combing to measure 
his next cut, the easiest question to 
ask is one that explores something 
further what his customer has said. 
Like a good therapist or a good 
parent, 
Mastroianni 
listens—he 
knows to focus with full attention 
(sometimes there’s not much hair 
there to busy him), acknowledge 
feelings with a single word (“No!?”), 
give feelings a name (preferably an 
Italian one: “So you’re saying he’s 
a socialista?”), and grant wishes 
in a fantasy.  After his haircut, the 
disabled former high school football 
player barrels into Mastroianni with 
excessive force. “You are strong 
today, Brucey!”  For the 77-year-old 
man, it may not feel like a fantasy. 
But for Bruce, one more tackle, 
twice each month, may make a 
difference.

W
hen Mastroianni’s customers 
get 
around 
to 
talking 
politics, they do so as a release 
from other frustrations.  They talk 
about things no one can change, it 
seems, as a way to forget the difficult 
things that they must change 
themselves.  The talk isn’t a sign of 
collective empowerment anymore, 
but of an individual powerlessness 
that everyone shares. Mastroianni’s 
customers don’t want political 
conversation, but rather a chair from 
which to sound a long complaint.

A young man comes in 
with gumboots, jeans that could 
catch wind, and a Sean Jean jacket 
that must have been kitten soft 
before it went through the wash.  He 
has dark hair, and lots of it.

“I want it real short, short 
short short! You know, Caesar-like.”

“I see,” Mastroianni flicks 
on the clippers. “You want to be 
free, not a slave to your hair, right?”

Mastroianni lets the soft-
faced man move from “Platonic, 
you know, not sexual,” to “child 
support,” to the failing grades his 
teenage son is getting in school.  He 
tires of talking until Mastroianni 
awakens him with a change of 
subject. 

“So the economy’s got to 
change, huh?”  

His cheeks alight with 
energy, but he soon sinks back 
into cold anxiety.  The middle 
class just can’t compete with the 
money backing these politicians. 
Mastroianni stops. The man’s head 
protrudes like the point of an 
iceberg from the black and ochre sea 
of his apron, a sea-foam napkin at 
his neck.  Mastroianni seems unable 
to size up what’s beneath. 

	
“Well, you know, we have 
to talk about it. We just can’t think 
about it.”
