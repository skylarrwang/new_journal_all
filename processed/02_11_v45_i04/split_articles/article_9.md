In the spirit of this year’s theme, the editors of The New Journal find it 
appropriate to explain the roots of our very own name. The New Journal is not, in fact, 
all that new—we’ve been around since 1967. What the title refers to is the concept 
of “new journalism,” a name for long-form nonfiction that was coined in the 1960s 
and popularized by Truman Capote, Gay Talese, and Tom Wolfe. “New Journalism” 
was used to describe writing that went against established convention and brought 
creativity and artfulness to the field of nonfiction. The New Journal itself was Yale’s 
response to this shift in style and an attempt by students to shake up Yale’s journalistic 
scene. 

In 1967, The New Journal’s founding editors penned the following mission statement:
“The university has once again reached the stage in history where people are taking 
about the New Yale, presumably to be distinguished from the Old Yale, which in its 
own day was presumably considered new. 
“Wishing to share in this modernity, we have chosen The New Journal as the name for 
our publication. Besides, things seemed slow around here.”

Forty-four years later, we may not be new anymore, but we’re still trying to invigorate 
and enlighten. We are still striving to push the boundaries of reporting at Yale—
touching issues no one else will and exploring them in depth. We hope our work will 
not just make you think, but make you feel. After all, journalism provides the seed of 
information and the light of perspective—but it is up to you, dear readers, to let these 
thoughts take root.
