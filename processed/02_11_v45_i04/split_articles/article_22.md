EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The number of Chinese children adopted by American families is 
increasing every year, as is the age of the children adopted. Helen Gao 
meets two such children to learn about their experiences. 


Zeng Tuo arrived at  Donnasue 
Graesser’s New Haven home 
in January 2010, the year he 
turned nine. Just shy of four-and-a-
half feet, he spins around the house 
like a Frisbee, one moment fighting 
over a dreidel with his brother and 
the next jerking his mother’s apron, 
asking for hot chocolate. Occasionally, his dark, animated eyes pause 
on me in a long, curious stare. 

Penelope (whose name 
has been changed by her mother’s 
request) joined Kathleen Heller’s 
family in February 2010 at the age 
of thirteen and a half. Sitting by 
the living room table, she attempts 
to answer her mother’s questions 
with English phrases, but often re-
treats to a nod or shake of the head, 
an embarrassed smile adorning her 
dimpled face. She converses with me 
in Mandarin in a low, calm voice, as 
if the story she is telling belongs to 
someone else.

Zeng Tuo and Penelope are 
Chinese orphans adopted by Ameri-
can parents. Neither of them knew 
the English word “parents” before 
their adoptions. They have flown 
across the Pacific Ocean, mixed 
in with crowds of businessmen in 
search of profits and students in 
search of education, to find families. 

Their arrivals in the United 
States mark a new trend in Ameri-
can adoptions from China. Twenty 
years ago, when China first opened 
for international adoption, almost 
all the adoptees were infant girls 
in swaddling clothes, leaving their 
homeland before they even knew 
how to pronounce its name. After 
ten years, the number of children 
adopted from China to the United 
States per year reached 8,000, with 
a long line of parents on the wait-
ing list. Today, according to the 
Chinese government, the demand 
has outstripped the number of Chi-
nese infants available for adoption, 
and American families are encour-
aged to adopt instead from a pool 
of older children, many of whom 
have special needs. Since 2005, 
these children have constituted the 
main body of adoptees from China, 
a trend likely to continue as the 
number of domestic adoptions rises 
and the rate of infants abandoned at 
birth decreases. The older newcom-
ers, usually moving to the United 
States between ages 7 and 14—the 
upper age limit set by the Chinese 
law for international adoption—
face a new set of challenges. Unlike 
the children adopted at birth who 
arrive in America with blank slates, 
older adoptees struggle to reconcile 
their ties to China with their new 
lives as Americans. 

Kneeling on a chair next 
to the dinner table, Zeng Tuo wolfs 
down rice with scrambled eggs and 
tomatoes, one of his favorite home-
made Chinese dishes. His plump 
cheeks peek out from behind the 
large porcelain bowl he holds up to 
his face. Just back from a karate les-
son, he is still in his white practice 
robes, tightened around his skinny 
torso with a red belt.

Zeng Tuo, referred to as Z.T. in the 
house, may have been born deaf, 
but was not officially diagnosed 
until age 2 or 3. From then on, he 
was deemed “unadoptable.” He has 
no birth certificate. The earliest 
documentation of his existence is a 
“baby found” advertisement posted 
on a local newspaper. “Zeng Tuo,” 
the one-line ad says, using the name 
given by the orphanage where he 
temporarily lived: “male infant, dark 
skin and average weight, found at 
Changsha West Bus Station.” 

Looking at a photo of 
the advertisement Graesser puts in 
front of me, I shudder at the word 
“Changsha.” A charming city in 
southern China and my father’s 
hometown, I have spent many Chi-
nese New Year’s Eves there, facing 
a table of steaming home-cooked 
dishes and surrounded by smiling 
faces of aunts, uncles, and grand-
parents.

The ad went unanswered, 
and Z.T. became a long-term resi-
dent of the orphanage. At age 4 or 
5, he was sent to an asylum called 
“Hope House” built by a Christian 
missionary group, where he lived 
together with other children with 
special needs. There, he received 
just limited care, Graesser says, be-
cause “he was a little bit too high-
functioning” compared to some of 
his immobile peers. The missionar-
ies sent him to school, but eventu-
ally he dropped out because of his 
hearing impairment. At 6, he met 
a family from New Jersey that con-
sidered adopting him. He spent two 
days with the family, but was sent 
back to the orphanage by himself.  

“He wouldn’t calm down. 
He was so hyperactive, and…they 
thought his table manners were bad. 
He put his face down to his dish 
when he ate!” Graesser says. She 
explains that the family from New 
Jersey, after observing his behavior, 
felt he was too much to handle. 

“I’m sort of glad they 
didn’t adopt him then,” Graesser 
says, her voice lifting. “Because he is 
a lot to handle. And, plus, he is now 
my son!”

Once again homeless, Z.T. 
returned to his familiar bed in the 
orphanage, reading all day and go-
ing to sleep immediately after din-
ner. It was not long, however, until 
he met a British foster family living 
in Changsha that took him to their 
house first for weekends and then 
for longer periods of time. The fam-
ily assembled a photo album of the 
year they spent together. One pic-
ture features Z.T. spinning around 
on a carousel, grinning widely. An-
other shows him amid a group of 
boys his age, seated at a ceramics 
wheel, his hands and face covered 
in mud. But the foster family could 
not provide a permanent home for 
Z.T. They planned to return to Brit-
ain in only a few years. 

Since Z.T. arrived at the Graess-
ers’ house, he has embraced body 
language to express his feelings. He 
devours his dinners with a satisfied 
grunt. When he wants a grape-fla-
vored ice bar from the freezer, he 
yanks a corner of his mother’s apron 
and gestures in sign language. His 
thin arms draw animated lines and 
curves across his chest, in front of 
his face and above his head. Deter-
mined to make himself understood, 
he furrows his eyebrows into a knot. 
Z.T. seems to understand he is now 
part of a family from which he will 
never be parted. His father, Carl, 
drives him from school to karate 
classes, and his brother, Simon—the 
family’s biological son—has taught 
him to play computer games. Don-
nasue Graesser has learned both 
Chinese and American sign languag-
es, so that she can use the former to 
teach Z.T. the latter. Language, she 
believes, is key to Z.T.’s integration 
into the new society, as well as his 
tie to his past one.  In addition to 
learning the signs, he can pronounce 
some words verbally, albeit with dif-
ficulty. 

“Z.T., come here!” Graess-
er gestures at him. “Tell her your 
name.”

The boy leans against the 
dinner table near me, his fingers 
rolling a corner of his shirt. “Zet, 
Tet!”

“No, no, your Chinese 
name,” Graesser shakes her head 
with an exaggerated motion and 
puts up a finger. 

The boy’s thin lips curl 
into a smile, half shy and half sly, 
then he suddenly turns away to dash 
at his brother.  

“I ask him all the time 
when he signs something: ‘How 
do you sign it in Chinese?’ I want 
him to retain his native language,” 
Graesser says. 

She also takes him fre-
quently to Chinese culture camps, 
encourages him to socialize with 
other Chinese adoptees, and makes 
a point to cook Chinese vegetable 
dishes at home every night. 

After dinner, Carl makes 
green tea for the family. Z.T. signs 
that he prefers hot chocolate in-
stead, with “lots and lots of marsh-
mallows.” 

As the family sits down 
around the dinner table, sipping 
their steaming drinks, I ask what 
Graesser hopes to achieve with her 
efforts. 

Carl, who has remained 
quiet for the entire evening, sudden-
ly starts to speak. He explains that 
they don’t want Z.T. to lose sight of 
his heritage. “For you and me, we go 
back to New Jersey, I drive around 
and could remember it all. For him, 
he won’t have that opportunity.  We 
are not doing it for us; we are doing 
it for him.”

Graesser motions to Z.T. 
“Z.T., look at mom, look at me for 
a second.” Her smiling face turns 
stern. “When you grow older, will 
you want to take a plane to go back
