   ENDNOTE
By Victor Zapana
A
s a second-semester senior, 
with the clock ticking 
down to graduation, I feel 
compelled to make the most of my 
remaining time at Yale: to learn the 
lessons that matter, and to fill my 
remaining neurons with the most 
important information I can find. 
By this, of course, I mean learn to 
play beer pong.


I meant Beirut. I knew 
that. Bei. Root.


I should have honed this 
skill long ago, but it can’t be that 
hard, right?  You only need: one 
long table, 22 red Solo cups, two 
teams of two students each, another 
team waiting to play, and three 
random Yalies awkwardly watching 
because they don’t know anyone 
else at the party.


And the rules? Here are 
the basics, as I understand them 
from a single freshman-year foray 
into the game:
1.) Stand at one end of the table.
2.) Close your eyes.
3.) Throw a ping pong ball at the 
10 cups on the other end. (They 
belong to the other team.)
4.) Hope that the ball drops into 
one of those cups. 
5.) Open your eyes.


There are other rules to 
the game, which vary by region. 
According to tradition, the original 
version of the game began at either 
Bucknell or Lehigh University. 
Conceived in a fraternity (hopefully 
the only thing conceived there 
that year), it was named after the 
Lebanese city because a Hezbollah 
suicide 
bomber 
attacked 
an 
American camp there. (Real life too 
real? Keep drinking.)


After a colossal failure I 
won’t validate by mentioning here, I 
decided not to play another game of 
Beirut after freshman year. (Rather, 
none of my roommates wanted 
to play with me.) But I was sure I 
could improve. I just needed to find 
a tutor who was always playing the 
game, perfecting his techniques. I 
needed a Van Wilder, or that old guy 
in Glory Days who never graduates. 
But I was afraid of fraternities. To 
whom could I turn?


“How can I even pretend 
to teach you when I have no idea 
myself?!” wrote Southern belle and 
sorority member Courtney Pannell 
’11 in an e-mail. “I know this might 
be comical all-in-all, but I’m deeply 
distressed by the fact that I’m so 
bad at beer pong. It’s like a personal 
failure of mine that I cannot correct 
for. Can’t you get…someone who 
may have something more to say 
than ‘You just throw it at it and 
hope for the best?’”


Just throw it at it. Huh, I 
never thought of that. 


I decided to test Pannell’s 
strategy at Feb Club, 28 days of 
liquor-fueled fun, one of the last 
hoorahs for the senior class. At 
one of the parties, a group of three 
seniors announced that they needed 
a fourth player to start a game. I 
volunteered, ready to show how 
much I’d learned. 


I picked up a ping-pong 
ball, looked at one of my opponents’ 
red cups, bent my arm, and—Ah! 
It went in! I got it in! THIS IS SO 
AWESOME.


My team ultimately won 
that game, and I contributed (two 
cups). I said bye to those three 
seniors, whose names I did not 
catch, and moved on, saying hi to 
other awkwardly sipping seniors. I 
felt happy. 


I was sure then that after I 
graduated Yale—and went to work 
sober, wallowing in memories of 
college—I would never play Beirut 
again. But I had finally learned the 
lesson that mattered. Whether I 
remembered it the next morning is 
another story.
