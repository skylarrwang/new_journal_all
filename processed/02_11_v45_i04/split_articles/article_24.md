and the next. Several of them mention an elementary school—Wang-
fanhuizu Wangdong Elementary 
School. “I think that’s it!” I turn to 
Penelope.

She is already in her moth-
er’s hug, her face hidden behind 
Heller’s thick, blonde hair. “This is 
big. This is big,” I hear the mother 
murmuring.

I copy down the name of 
the school and its street address, put 
it in my pocket, and tiptoe to the 
closet to grab my coat. 

In the days that follow, I 
check  Heller’s blog several times a 
day, without knowing what to ex-
pect. An outcry of joy? A mother-
daughter heart-to-heart? Or a travel 
itinerary to China?  Instead, a week 
later, an email pops up in my inbox. 
It is from Penelope. 

“Dear Yuxin,” she writes, 
“thanks for visiting us. There is 
something I hope to tell you. When 
you return to China, could you 
please not go look for my grand-
mother?”

Confused, I keep reading. 
She confesses that she had seen her 
grandmother, in truth, not long be-
fore she left for the United States. 
At the suggestion of the caretakers 
at the welfare institute, she had con-
cealed this fact so that she would 
have a greater chance of getting ad-
opted. 

“When my grandmother 
heard that I was leaving for Amer-
ica, she cried for a long time and 
held my hands really tight. She told 
me to be nice to people I meet in 
America.

“For now, I don’t hope to 
disturb her. If I bring my family to 
the village to visit her, she would 
feel she had lost me forever—I am 
at home now, but she is all by her-
self. All I am hoping now is to grow 
up, until I can go back to China by 
myself. It’s my dream and my every-
day wish.

“My mom thinks scars can 
only heal if you expose them…I 
would rather endure the pain, and 
not let it heal. I am thankful of 
everything my mom has done for 
me…but only this, I prefer not to let 
her know. Can you help me, Yuxin?”

“Dear Penelope,” I type, “I 
am so sorry for not having noticed 
your feelings during my visit that 
day…”

I stop, not knowing what 
to type next.
F
or both Z.T. and Penelope, per-
haps there is a greater distance 
that separates them from their 
homeland than the 12,300-mile-
wide Pacific Ocean, a distance that, 
despite kind attempts, no language 
or cultural activities could bridge for 
them.

Graesser shares this view. 
“I was thinking a lot after your visit 
about why I want Z.T. to maintain 
some of his cultural identity,” she

writes to me in an email days af-
ter my visit. “The rest of us have a 
family ‘history.’ We know our par-
ents, grandparents, great-grandpar-
ents. We know their stories, occu-
pations, travels—and we take pride 
in our connection to our ances-
tors. For kids like Z.T., they have no 
family history. Our adoptive family 
can never replace that missing piece 
of his history. So it seems the clos-
est thing we can do for him is to at 
least maintain some connection to 
his birth country, although it never 
seems quite adequate.” 

What kind of connection 
is it, I wonder?

Perhaps the boy in the ka-
rate robe and the girl crying under 
the blanket are still figuring that 
out.
