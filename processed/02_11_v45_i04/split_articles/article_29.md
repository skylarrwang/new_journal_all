steps below, and then attempted to 
press my scrunched lips against her 
mouth with the vigor one normally 
applies to scarfing down a roast-beef 
sandwich or blowing out a wad of 
birthday candles.  Even today, the 
memory registers like an ice cube 
dropped down the back of my shirt.


Eventually I shed these 
growing pains.  By the time I reached 
college I had kissed a girl with actual 
success (we were both sitting down); 
I had started to purchase jeans that 
fit my legs and sent the old clownish 
corduroys to Goodwill; I had even 
begun to hit the gym on my own 
volition. But the shorts remain to 
this day. I’ve grown into them a 
little, but they still swing around 
noisily when I run, still shroud my 
legs, still look a little as though 
I’d snatched them from the closet 
of MC Hammer at his prime. I 
maintain an abusive relationship 
with these shorts, habitually tossing 
them into the corner, unwashed 
and unfolded. Perhaps this passive 
aggression betokens the Freudian 
baggage that returns whenever I 
tighten their drawstrings around 
my waist.  For even as I distance 
myself from the psychochemical 
clusterfuck of puberty, I’m not quite 
ready to shed the adolescent instinct 
to hide, curl up, and bury my 
knobby limbs in voluminous nylon.


To this day, when I dress 
up to go out, and fix my hair in 
place with a few practiced swipes, 
and unbutton my top button so 
that just a tentative triangle of chest 
hair peeks out, I don’t quite believe 
the act.  When late at night I break 
off drunken flirtations to stare at 
myself foggily in the glass of some 
bathroom mirror, I call my own 
bluff.  I’m a man, I say to myself. 
I’m tall and strong and statistically 
desirable.  But then I blink and 
there’s 
a 
lanky 
seventh-grader, 
standing on the basketball court, 
apologizing to those he touches, 
swaddling himself in pendulous 
shorts.  After all these years, I think 
my mind still hasn’t caught up to my 
body.  Sometimes I have to shut it 
off: Only when I loosen those rangy 
limbs with rows of shots or packs of 
beers can I compel them to twine 
around the waist of another human 
being.  And then, in the dark of 
a strange room, when my mind 
settles for a minute, again I want to 
murmur “I’m sorry” for being large 
and sloppy and intrusive by default. 
I still don’t feel lucky to be tall.  I feel 
far too small to be living in this body.
I’m a man, I say 
to myself.  I’m 
tall and strong 
and statistically 
desirable.
