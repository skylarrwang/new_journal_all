A family of four on the road back to 
the farm stand after picking their fill 
of apples. 
from Northeastern University, Sarah 
is poised to handle the booming 
business behind these apples. 
She is the oldest of the 
four siblings. The others are Allison, 
a teacher; Carrie, an accountant; 
and Ryan, still a student. When it 
became apparent that neither of 
her sisters who had come of age was 
eager to take on the farm’s operation, 
Sarah left the career she’d begun in 
marketing for Bishop’s. “I think 
everyone says, ‘What if,’” she says 
now. “No matter what industry 
you’re in. I may be wrong, but I 
think everyone has that side of them 
that says, Hey, I wish I could have 
been something else…There’s just 
not enough time in a short life.” 
Without 
training 
in 
spraying, pest management, or any 
of the other day-to-day tasks of a 
farm’s operation, it’s possible that 
Sarah may not be able to run the 
farm alone, as her great-uncle later 
told me. Watching Sarah handle the 
day’s tasks, however, I never would

Periodically, her cell 
phone beeped—always a crisis. 	
	
“You’ve got to be kidding 
me,” she said, as we stood in front of 
the cider. “I’m having a heart attack 
as we speak.” She picked up a few 
bottles, examined them, replaced 
them, and hung up the phone. 
“Always something.” This time, she 
had been informed that the bar code 
on the redesigned cider label was 
incorrect. The last time, the grill 
near the apple trees, which had been 
turning out hot dogs for customers 
picking apples, was out of propane. 
To solve that problem, she found 
her father, Keith Bishop. Keith is 
one of the current CEOs of Bishop’s 
Orchards, in charge of its business 
operation. His cousin Jonathan, who 
presides over planting, harvesting, 
and spraying crops, is the other.
There are blood Bishops, 
Sarah explained, as we sat on straw 
bales, readying ourselves for a 
hayride around the apple orchard, 
and then there are spouses, like 
Sarah’s mother and uncle. Besides 
Sarah, her father, and his cousin, 
blood Bishops currently involved 
in the farm’s operation include 
her aunt, the bakery manager. It is 
Sarah’s grandfather Albert Bishop 
and her great-uncle Gene Bishop, 
however, who remain the Bishops’ 
reigning patriarchs.
Fourth Generation
“T
his is the kind of weather we 
dream about,” crowed Gene 
when I joined him in his office one 
October day. “These are the days 
that make or break the business. A 
good weekend like this goes a long 
way.” From the lines of customers 
and cars parked close on the grass, I 
could see what he meant. I could see 
how the farm’s success might hinge 
on a single perfect day.
	
Gene had just come from 
home, but, like all the other Bishops 
and Bishop employees, he wore 
a forest-green polo shirt with the 
company’s logo over his heart. He 
lives next to Bishop’s Orchards, and 
always has. “I can walk up that hill 
up the street over there,” he said, 
“and I can see all three houses I’ve 
ever lived in.” Gene drove a tractor 
for the first time in 1938, when he 
was five years old, eight years after 
a Connecticut agricultural report 
noted the Bishops’ own New Haven 
County as the largest apple producer 
in the state.
Growing up during the 
Great Depression, Gene graduated 
from Guilford High School with 
a class of only 32. “It was a small 
class,” he quipped, “because anyone 
born in 1933 was not planned.” 
After a few years at the University 
of Connecticut, Gene returned to 
Bishop’s Orchards, married his wife 
at 21, and went about beginning his 
life as a farmer, working with his 
father and his uncle. He sold life 
insurance on the side for the first few 
years, but after that, he restricted 
his activities to farming and farm 
management. He enlisted during 
the Korean War, and then delayed 
his service in order to farm.
	
“It’s been a very rewarding 
life,” Gene said. “The longer I’ve 
been here, the more I like it.” 
	
He has been here long 
enough to remember peddling 
“second”-quality apples door-to-
door around town. He can remember 
1957, when Bishop’s Orchards was 
incorporated as a business, with 
Gene’s father as president, Gene as 
vice president, Gene’s cousin Albert 
as secretary, and Albert’s father as 
treasurer. Gene continued to work 
for the farm until his son Jonathan 
and Albert’s son Keith took over. 
After that, Gene ran the town. He 
served ten years on Guilford’s Board 
of Selectmen, two of them as First 
Selectman, and he currently serves 
as the Chairman of Guilford’s Public 
Works Commission. 
	
When Gene showed me 
the map hanging on the Bishop’s 
Orchards’ office’s wall, I could 
see that here in Guilford, his leap 
from farm management to town 
management was logical. Bishop’s 
Orchards occupies a large patch 
of town. In fact, when this map 
was made in 1970, even more of 
Guilford was covered in farmland. 
Gene stood and pointed out places 
where three other orchards once 
stood, all within a stone’s throw of 
Bishop’s.
	
Sullivan’s Orchards is all 
grown over, he said, because after 
Don Sullivan retired twenty years 
ago, none of his family would 
resume its operation, and “the farm 
just sat there.” Hilltop Orchards, 
Keith Bishop’s 
business card reads 
“Co-CEO, Treasurer 
& Winemaker.”
Sarah 
Bishop-Dellaventura 
loves apples. For her 
October wedding, the 
party favors were two 
hundred jars of 
applesauce, 
homemade by her 
grandmother.


too, “stopped growing anything” a 
long time ago. Desperate for funds 
after he couldn’t find anyone to 
inherit its operation, Hilltop’s last 
owner-operator sold all the topsoil. 
“He doesn’t have anything left to 
grow on,” said Gene. “He sold the 
land to the YMCA.” Until recently, 
Guilford’s only active farm and 
farmer’s market besides Bishop’s 
was Fanicello’s, but its youngest 
generation showed no interest in 
their inheritance, and now, the land 
lies fallow. 
“We’ve 
been 
fortunate 
so far,” Gene said of his family, 
whose way of life depends on the 
willingness of the sixth generation 
of Bishops to continue the farm’s 
operation.
An Inheritance for Generations
T
he Bishops usually employ 
about 
one 
hundred 
non-
Bishops, Sarah explained, as we 
clambered aboard the hayride. This 
time of year there are closer to 120, 
or 140. Non-Bishop employees 
include a man whom Sarah called 
“Crazy John,” the man driving our 
hayride. Kids wait for his tractor, 
she explained, because they know he 
gives the fastest ride. “Most kids do 
end up crying,” joked Crazy John, 
as he latched the hayride’s railing 
behind us, “so I know I’m doing a 
good job.” Sarah and I sat on the 
straw as Crazy John went into the 
tractor and started up the hayride. 
When we reached the top 
of the hill, the ride stopped with 
a shudder, and more passengers 
boarded. An hour later, people 
would line up twenty deep to take 
the ride to the best apple trees in 
this 220-acre section of land—the 
largest continuous piece of the 
313-acre farm, where rows of apple-
freckled trees are clearly labeled 
so the orchard’s patrons can know 
whether they’re harvesting Ida Red 
or Macintosh, Golden Delicious or 
Stayman. After all, some pickers are 
quite picky. 
“Get the reddest, most 
beautiful,” said one mother to her 
three small girls. “And this is how 
you do it. Listen to me before you 
pick an apple. Twist, twist—and 
then pull.” The family lives in 
Guilford and comes here, the mother 
told me, “just about every year.” 
Her daughters toddled at her feet, 
holding buckets, and their father 
explained today’s strategy. “My wife 
wants to make applesauce and pies,” 
he said, “and I want some for eating. 
We tried to pick the ones that were 
good for all of those categories. 
Jonagold, Mutsu, and—what was 
the other kind we were looking for?” 
“Cortland,” supplied his 
wife. 
“Oh,” he said, “I see some 
over there, girls!” And the girls 
ran off, buckets in hand, between 
the rows, the early afternoon sun 
shining off their white-blond heads. 
It was that time of year. 
“Something about apple-
picking and fall foliage—it screams 
New England,” Sarah said. “I can’t 
imagine living anywhere else this 
time of year.” In fact, the American 
tradition of apples is rooted in 
New England, where early English 
settlers first introduced the fruit. By 
1641, representatives of the king of 
England had decreed that settlers 
claiming more than 100 acres of 
land in the colonies must use some 
of that acreage to plant apple trees. 
Apple seeds and seedlings later found 
their way from New England into 
wagons of settlers headed westward. 
Johnny 
“Appleseed” 
Chapman, 
the legendary outdoorsman who 
took sacks of apple seeds down 
the Mississippi and deep into the 
frontier, was from Massachusetts. 
	
Today, 
Yale 
students 
frequently visit nearby Bishop’s 
Orchards on field trips subsidized by 
their residential college masters, who 
want to give all their students the 
chance to acquaint themselves with 
the autumn harvest. “The fall trip to 
Bishop’s Orchards for apple picking 
is a decade-long Pierson tradition,” 
proclaimed the “Pierson Sun,” a 
newsletter of Pierson College, in 
October. For these new Connecticut 
residents, 
it’s 
an 
important 
introduction to their home.
Unlike 
the 
Hanelius 
family, who owned the Connecticut 
apple orchard of my childhood, the 
Bishops feel no economic pressure to 
sell their land, Sarah reassured me. 
The only pressure comes from loyal 
customers who want to make sure 
the Bishops keep the land they have 
farmed for 139 years. To Guilford 
residents, what Sarah is poised to 
inherit is nothing short of a legend. 
She told me that growing up a Bishop 
was hard, because everyone in town 
recognized her and her siblings—
and knew their parents, whom 
they’d notify when Sarah so much as 
ran a red light. “I grew up living in 
a glass house,” she said. “Everywhere 
you went,” her sister Allison 
Pasquier added in an e-mail, “people 
would ask if you were a Bishop like 
the apple Bishops.” In Guilford, the 
Bishops are an institution—one 
whose maintenance requires work, 
perseverance, and a certain steely 
attitude.
