P
lacido Mastroianni cuts hair 
in a barbershop he calls a 
salon. “Salone means ‘you 
receive the people,’” he says. He 
takes a little off the top from any 
man who comes in. Men who don’t 
have much hair on their heads still 
have a lot on their minds.  In the 
weeks before November 2, 2010, 
their minds were on the mid-term 
elections. And Mastroianni, like 
any good barber, was ready to comb 
out the tangles. 


One 
customer 
calls 
Mastroianni the Walter Winchell 
of Whalley Avenue. Like New 
York’s old-time radio host, the 
New Haven barber seems to know 
what’s happening everywhere at 
once. But the comparison falls 
short. Winchell once ruffled his 
national audience by saying that 
President Truman “does not know 
what the h-e-double-l is going on.” 
Mastroianni, on the other hand, 
whose voice is as reassuring as his 
hands are deliberate, takes care not 
to prick anyone’s ears.  He focuses 
through his terracotta-colored rims 
and snips head hair, ear hair, nose 
hair, and “these three hairs on the 
neck,” he tells a customer, “because 
it bothers me.” 


Customers come to talk; 
Mastroianni does the listening.
Listening has long been 
his livelihood. As a boy working the 
fields of Amorosi, Italy, Mastroianni 
listened for approaching American 
bombers.  School had closed for the 
war, and when the chores were done 
and the sky grew silent, he and his 
brothers became joyful vagabondes. 
They roved through the soldiers’ 
camp outside town, where they 
played soccer and sometimes shared 
an idle soldier’s single cigarette.  On 
weekends, the children gathered 
to hear the war news at the village 
barbershop. 


When 
Mastroianni 
immigrated to Connecticut at age 
17, he strained to hear instructions 
spoken in English over the din of 
factory equipment. He listened well 
and, wanting to become his own 
boss, left the factory four years later 
to enroll in barber school.  Cutting 
hair has made up for an education 
cut short by the war.  Since 1953, 
he has listened to as many as four 
men an hour (indeed a barber must, 
to make ends meet) and has mulled 
over each day’s news during the 
slow spells.  After 57 years of work, 
Mastroianni’s back has come to 
rest at a curve somewhere between 
its one-quarter stoop for tending 
to black curls, grey tufts, and 
white wisps, and its three-quarter 
hunch for reading about the 1970 
election of an Italian-American 
mayor in New Haven, the 1983 
bombing of the Marine barracks 
in Beirut, and the 2004 undoing 
of the Great Bambino’s curse on 
the Boston Red Sox.  He looks up 
from the New Haven Register on his 
heavy desk.  “All of a sudden, you 
sit here for hours, nobody comes 
in, you wonder, ‘What the fuck 
happened?’”


But the bells have always 
jangled again at the glass door, and 
each time, Mastroianni has risen 
to his feet to cut more hair, to 
listen to another side of the story. 
An American veteran once told of 
flying over Mastroianni’s village 
during the Second World War.  He 
dropped bombs near the town, low 
on fuel and forced to lighten his 
load. Other customers have brought 
stories that have become part of 
Mastroianni’s own. He once listened 
carefully to the mother of two boys 
whose hair he cut as she described 
her sister’s imminent arrival from 
Italy. Mastroianni won over that 
sister not long after she landed; the 
boys are now his nephews.


O
n a morning in election 
season, the golden light on 
Whalley Avenue looks warmer 
than it feels, and the red and blue 
posters promise more than seems 
possible.  Shaw’s Supermarket is 
boarded up, as is Minore’s Market, 
though only the first is out of 
business.  Campaign signs totter on 
ground littered with chicken bones 
and empty single-shots of 70-proof 
Jeremiah Weed. BLUMENTHAL, 
Brains, Not $Buck$ and Brawns, 
lies belly up in mud. 


Coming 
for 
“relaxing 
time” and his second haircut this 
month, Andy Esposito drives into 
town in his black Cadillac.  He 
passes the For Sale signs that 
condemn century-old homes still 
on the block (Come See. . .Will Not 
Last), and turns into the driveway of 
the only one still well kept.  


He drives past the bare 
earth where three bushes have been 
stolen from the front yard, parks in 
back, and enters the salon. 


A purple awning leads 
customers up the stairs and into 
the baby-yellow clapboard home 
of Placido’s Hair Cutting Salon. 
Though floors and walls are now 
covered with silver-swirled gray 
linoleum, the house still has a hearth 
and mantle.  The hearth is covered 
with damp neck rags, the mantle 
with pictures of customers.  There’s 
a photo of a mother holding her 
son for his first haircut, and then 
another of her holding her grandson 
for his.  The salon has occupied 
this living room since 1976, when 
Mastroianni relocated from the 
YMCA. Today, he shares the space 
with Mike Maraucci, who brought 
his barbershop from Chapel Street to 
Mastroianni’s address in 2001. The 
two share expenses, talk baseball, 
and occasionally give one another a 
quick haircut. Mastroianni likes his 
spare hairs cut short and Maraucci 
likes them cut off all together—
shaved right down to a shine. 


Esposito, who has been 
coming to Placido’s Hair Cutting 
Salon for 34 years, is the customer 
who 
called 
Winchell of Whalley. “We talk a lot 
about what’s really happened in this 
country in the last fifty years,” he 
says.  The talk gets hot. Esposito is an 
entrepreneur in protein powder. He 
takes pride in the value he provides 
for his customers, and offense at 
those who make money without 
offering customers anything of 
substance.  His voice quickens with 
anger over “Wall Street fuckers,” 
then quivers with disgust when he 
describes a generation of “public-
service assholes” who are too 
incompetent to straighten out the 
Wall Street types. Mastroianni never 
dismisses complaints yet never fully 
allows for pessimism either.  


 “But I thought he was the 
guy we like?” He stops cutting hair 
and leans his upper body away from 
Esposito’s head, as if to get a better 
view of his thinking. 


“Well, he sold himself as 
one thing, and as soon as he got in, 
he did everything the way he said he 
wouldn’t.”


Mastroianni is working 
on the hair that hadn’t passed his 
survey. “Hmm,” he sympathizes, as 
he combs—clip, clip. “They all do 
that a little bit, don’t they?” 


The old barber “knows 
how to light a fire under my ass,” 
says Esposito. But 850 haircuts 
into their relationship, Mastroianni 
has proven competent at keeping 
Esposito seated in that big green 
Belmont, no matter how hot his seat 
becomes. Esposito leans back into 
the chair, his aviator glasses removed, 
his eyes closed, and Mastroianni’s 
hand at the back of his head.  He 
looks like Julius Caesar, and opens 
his eyes only for emphasis.  “I like 
to have somebody take care of me; 
“Everything 
homemade is 
better,” says 
Mastroianni, 
“except 
haircuts.”
