On Height 
and Hiding
Cory Finley remembers what it was 
like to stand tall, but walk small.
   Personal Essay
I’ve owned the longest is a pair of 
gym shorts so loose and long and 
baggy that they do the impossible: 
make me look damn near squat. 
“Use your height!” I can 
still hear my father shouting from the 
edge of the middle school basketball 
court.  He himself was a basketball 
standout in high school because he 
harnessed his six feet six inches. On 
offense, he stretched out his massive 
arms to loft the ball into the basket; 
on defense, he puffed himself up 
and threw himself between his 
opponents and their goal.  I was 
an athletic embarrassment precisely 
because I refused to use my father’s 
genetic gift to me.  Faced with more 
aggressive opponents, I curled up 
and hunched down, once mumbling, 
“I’m sorry,” when my arm got in 
the way of an opponent’s shot. 
And in some fundamental 
way, I was sorry.  I didn’t ask to be tall. 
Somewhere between fifth and eighth 
grade, my body shot up, my limbs 
stretching wildly in all directions. 
My pubescent brain simply couldn’t 
keep up—there was just too much 
of me. I suddenly woke up each 
morning in a body that encroached 
on others’ space without even 
trying.  I saw myself as an inherent 
intrusion, so in my personal life, as 
on the basketball court, I sought 
out means to hide my outsize 
dimensions.  I scoured the Big-n-
Tall section at Target for clothes—
like those shorts—that engulfed 
me, clothes that hung around my 
body like great, big funeral palls 
and concealed me from public view. 
Maybe this was partly 
to hide from the female gaze—a 
dreaded force in the ticklish years 
of middle school.  The few times 
that a member of the opposite sex 
expressed interest in my physical 
properties, I assumed that she was 
joking. This body? This awkward 
lanky thing?  My first kiss came 
sophomore year, a closed-mouth 
peck onstage in a production of 
Cole Porter’s Anything Goes, and the 
prospect of it so terrified me that 
I feigned illness during the dress 
rehearsal just to postpone it another 
day.  The girl that I took to my first 
school dance began dating a woman 
a year later, and the next one was so 
much shorter than I was—even in 
four-inch heels—that we opted to 
skip the slow-dance entirely.  The 
third one I ended up dating, but 
only to the extent that watching 
Hotel Rwanda on my basement 
couch and accidentally half-groping 
her left breast can be called “dating.” 
That brief relationship ended shortly 
after our first kiss.  It went like this: 
I positioned her carefully on a step 
of my porch, placed myself two
