Fifth Generation
K
eith Bishop, Sarah’s father, 
wears many hats. His business 
card reads, “Co-CEO, Treasurer 
& Winemaker.” Also the Vice 
Chairman of the Guilford Board 
of Education, he told me he doesn’t 
take lightly his status as community 
leader. “To me, Bishop’s Orchards is 
synonymous with my family,” wrote 
Allison, “especially my father, who 
has lived his entire life in the context 
of the farm.” Keith’s e-mail signature 
includes a quotation from Richard 
Brinsley Sheridan, a nineteenth-
century British politician: “The 
surest way not to fail is to determine 
to succeed.”

Keith is a businessman. 
When I asked him about Bishop’s 
Orchards, he leapt quickly to 
“services we’re offering,” “product 
lines,” 
and 
maintaining 
the 
building’s “historical look.” The 
Bishops are active in lobbying for 
agricultural initiatives, and they are 
charter members of the University 
of New Haven Center for Family 
Business, where they learn to stay on 
top of trends, Keith said. He began 
cutting cabbage and lettuce in the 
farm’s vegetable beds as a boy, and 
he returned to work immediately 
after graduating from Cornell. He 
has been CEO for 12 years, and 
he spoke fluently of trends in apple 
picking that vary with the traffic 
of New Yorkers to their houses on 
Cape Cod.

Keith is the man to run 
this farm, but he plans to retire 
sometime over the next ten years, 
passing along his title to one of 
“those in the next generation who 
are interested in the business.” 
“Whoever that is,” he 
added.

The Last Generation
J
onathan, Keith’s cousin, has no 
children, but Keith has four, all 
of whom grew up with Bishop’s 
Orchards in mind. “The most 
memorable moments from my 
childhood would be the Guilford 
Fair Parade, which was always in 
September,” wrote Carrie Bishop, 
the youngest daughter, in an e-mail. 
“We would stay up almost all night 
the day before the parade to build a 
float that represented the farm, and 
would ride on the float in the parade 
as my Dad drove the tractor. We 
are a pretty tight family brought up 
with good traditions and values.”

Carrie now lives in Boston, 
working as an auditor at KPMG, 
an audit, tax, and advisory services 
firm. Recently engaged, she plans to 
settle in Massachusetts. “Currently, 
I do not have any hobbies that bring 
me closer to the farm,” she wrote, 
“besides being very picky about the 
fruit and produce I buy.”

Allison, 
middle 
daughter, is living with her husband 
in Brussels, teaching preschool at 
an international school there. She 
wrote from Belgium that she loves 
shopping at the farm market when 
she’s home, but can’t see leaving what 
she does to take a more active role in 
its success. “As for her future,” said 
her father, “she’s doing her thing.”


That leaves Sarah—and the 
youngest sibling, Ryan Bishop, who 
was out hiking with a Bishop cousin 
at twelve years old when he first 
realized that he and the other boy 
were the last two Bishops capable of 
passing on the family name. “Some 
people think my dad kept having 
kids until he had a son,” he’ll say 
now, recollecting that hike from his 
dorm room at Cornell University, 
his father’s alma mater, where he’s 
studying agricultural sciences and 
plant sciences with double minors in 
modern business and viticulture. 
“At this point, I’m pretty 
sure I’m going back,” said Ryan, 
after listing his majors and minors. 
He would fill Jonathan’s shoes as 
farm manager while his sister, like 
his father, keeps the books. Like 
Sarah, he’d like to enact certain 
changes to the farm; like Sarah, 
Ryan anticipates resistance from 
the conservative older generations, 
who continue to hold stock in the 
business after they retire. He’d 
especially like to put in grapevines.

“In middle school, people 
associated me with apples and gave 
me relevant nicknames,” Ryan said. 
Even so, Ryan’s future as a farmer 
was never a foregone conclusion. 
He entered Cornell as a pre-med 
student, shifting majors around the 
same time Sarah left her career in 
marketing. Ryan’s hobbies include 
playing 
saxophone 
guitar, 
rock climbing, ice climbing, and 
whitewater 
kayaking. 
However, 
though he’ll join friends on a rock-
climbing trip to Nevada over spring 
break, pruning work at Bishop’s 
Orchards was his destination in 
December.


Yet 
before 
he 
returns 
permanently, Ryan has two years 
left at college. In compliance with 
a Bishop family rule that young 
Bishops of his generation must work 
for two years outside the orchard 
before returning to the family 
business, he’ll then take more time 
away—at another farm, he offered, 
When she saw that 
neither of her sisters 
was eager to take on 
the farm’s operation, 
Sarah left the career 
she’d begun in 
marketing for 
Bishop’s. “I think 
everyone says, ‘What 
if,’” she says now.

in order to learn new techniques, or 
perhaps pursuing travel coordinated 
through WWOOF, World Wide 
Opportunities on Organic Farms. 
He also plans to apply to the Peace 
Corps. Those mandatory two years 
away from the farm, he said, might 
turn into five or ten.

His uncle, Keith’s brother, 
abandoned Bishop’s Orchards to 
start his own farm in Pennsylvania. 
Ryan plans to return to the farm, 
but how long he’ll take “would 
depend on where I land when I get 
out of college, how much I enjoy 
what I’m doing,” Ryan explained, all 
too aware of the sacrifices he would 
make. “My free time would be cut 
down significantly if I were running 
the farm myself. Once Jonathan 
takes off, it’s on my back.” About 
the possibility of return to the farm, 
Ryan speaks dutifully and carefully, 
the sharp focus of this picture of the 
rest of his life giving an edge to his 
voice as well.

For Now
W
hen Sarah and I disembarked 
the hayride, she found a 
comfortable picnic table, got us 
some cider, and we sat and talked 
business. Sarah told me to watch 
out for the bees that our opened 
bottles of cider attracted. She 
seemed to have inherited her father’s 
savoir-faire, mentioning renovation 
projects and trends that affect the 
grocery store (acai berries, gluten-
free, the movie Food Inc). It’s a large-
scale operation: this time of year, the 
Bishops receive deliveries of twenty 
to thirty tons of pumpkins weekly. 
Bishop’s Orchards closes only seven 
days out of the year. 

And yet Sarah seems up for 
anything. Her father emphasized to 
me that Sarah keeps too busy with 
her young children and the farm, 
but in person, she doesn’t show it. 
Tucking her blonde hair behind her 
ear, smiling when she talks, she is 
bright, efficient, and bubbly. The 
hayride was her idea.

Growing 
up, 
Sarah 
never thought she’d take over the 
family business. For a long time, 
in fact, she thought she might be a 
teacher. Then, after graduating from 
Northeastern, she worked for three 
years as marketing manager at Moffly 
Media in Greenwich, Connecticut. 
This job happened to comply 
with the Bishop family rule—but, 
that 
mandate 
notwithstanding, 
Sarah had her own goals. She had 
planned on living in New York and 
“working for some big magazine or 
ad industry.”

“I envy her,” Sarah said of 
her sister Allison, the one who lives 
in Brussels. “I think in my next life, 
maybe I’ll do what she does.” But for 
now, Sarah has prioritized Bishop’s 
Orchards. “I decided as the years 
went on that I wanted to see the 
business continue,” she said. In her 
sisters’ absence, Sarah has decided 
to take on the farm, with all its 
limitations. “As frustrating as it can 
be to work with family,” she says, 
“you do it.” You do it if you love the 
farm as much as Sarah does. 
 “This is what I grew up 
doing,” she continued, batting a 
bee away from her hair. “It’s what 
I love. I’m hap—pretty happy. I’m 
pretty happy…I feel stressed about 
it at times, but I never have any 
remorse.” She persists in the hope 
that her brother will grow up to join 
her—in whatever hope has kept this 
business afloat through 139 years 
of modernization. The strongest 
guarantor of Bishop’s Orchards’ 
survival is to keep it in the family. 
“I can’t picture this all being houses 
up here,” Sarah said, imagining 
what might happen eventually if the 
farm were sold to an outside party. 
“I don’t know if I’d forgive myself.” 
Apples themselves are cultivated by 
the grafting of branches onto trees 
already growing, but this farm’s 
roots run deep.

Not Far From the Tree
A
fter parting ways with the 
Bishops, 
I 
couldn’t 
resist 
buying one of the big white bags 
of apples—specifically, Macouns. I 
tried my first Macoun on the way 
home. The apple was small, filling 
my palm only partially, and bright 
red. When I took a bite, its skin 
gave way with a crunch, revealing a 
white, sweet interior. It was as crisp 
and hard as Sarah had promised. I 
ate the whole thing, quickly, and 
remembered joyfully that my bag 
of apples, the smallest size available, 
still held four quarts. The face 
of the bag told the apples’ story: 
APPLES & CIDER – BISHOP’S 
ORCHARDS – CONNECTICUT 
GROWN.


This 
story 
has 
been 
passed on through generations 
and culminates in that sharp, 
bright taste. In the end, that’s 
what all the effort is for. It’s the 
taste of my childhood and, for one 
Guilford family, something more 
important—something else entirely. 
But 
that’s 
comparing 
oranges and you-know-what.
