U
nlike for many of her classmates, 
post-graduate mornings for 
Teresa Serrano ’10 don’t consist of 
6 a.m. showers, daily caffeine rushes 
courtesy of Starbucks, or crowded 
subway rides to Wall Street. Nor 
can she be found enthusiastically 
singing the alphabet song to a group 
of kindergarteners in New Orleans 
as a Teach for America volunteer. 

Instead, the 22-year-old 
Latina spends most of her days 
at home in Texas, unemployed, 
unable to drive, and underachieving 
because of the place she was born. 
“My status has limited 
my life in unimaginable ways,” 
said Serrano, whose name has been 
changed to protect her. Like the 
other 9.3 million undocumented 
immigrants living in the United 
States, Serrano lacks the rights of 
a U.S. citizen. She cannot get a 
driver’s license and is unauthorized 
to work because, though she grew 
up here, she does not reside in the 
United States legally. For now, she 
remains trapped in limbo, educated 
and unemployed.  

Home Sweet Home

I
n the late 1970s, Serrano’s 
parents traveled from Honduras 
to the United States in search of 
economic opportunities and social 
advancement. Civil unrest and 
political instability plagued their 
home country, and her parents 
sought refuge away from an ongoing 
civil war. 

Her parents’ attempts to 
bear children led them back home. 
Her mother experienced several 
miscarriages and when she became 
pregnant with Teresa, she was 
diagnosed with a congenital heart 
disease that qualified her pregnancy 
as high risk. 

“In the United States, my 
parents were alone and on their 
own, whereas in Honduras they had 
the support of their family and loved 
ones,” Serrano said. “They were more 
familiar with the language, customs, 
and medical procedures there than 
in the United States, and this made 
the birthing process easier.”

At 13 months, when her 
mother was healthy again, Serrano 
returned with her parents to the 
United States on a tourist visa. Even 
after this visa expired, she continued 
to live in Texas with her parents. 
Shortly after their return to the 
United States, Serrano’s parents gave 
birth to her brother, who is now 
18 years old and attends Columbia 
University. Serrano’s father finally 
secured a green card in 2008, but 
for the majority of her life, he could 
have been deported at any moment.

 Growing Up American

S
errano’s parents raised her 
on working-class wages. Her 
mother, 52, works as a nanny, and 
her father, 54, is a maintenance 
worker. For several years the family 
lived together in a small two-
bedroom apartment. After years 
of saving, her parents were able to 
purchase a new home. They were 
“extremely resourceful,” Serrano 
said. 

Despite 
economic 
hardships, Serrano grew up in a 
loving household and retained strong 
bonds to her Hispanic heritage. She
