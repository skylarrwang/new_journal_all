the time, it seems, the squatter didn’t 
matter—either because no one used 
the office or because no one cared. 
Now, the editors are so concerned 
with office orderliness because they 
see the rundown Banner offices as 
a barrier to fulfilling the promise 
of The Yale Banner, the country’s 
oldest college yearbook. They are 
remodeling in order to reinvigorate 
and resurrect.

“Resurrection” has become the 
keyword for the 2011 Banner: new 
birth, new beginnings, new year, new 
yearbook. This might be a necessary 
strategy given that, despite 169 years 
of history, as Carter put it, “people 
don’t know Yale has a yearbook.”  
That Yale students would not 
know or care to know about their 
school’s own yearbook mystifies 
Eddie Breaux, proprietor of a bed 
and breakfast called McKendrick-
Breaux House in New Orleans, 
Louisiana, and one of the foremost 
amateur collectors of yearbooks. 
He owns many copies of the Banner 
and several rare specialty items 
of memorabilia, such as a Yale 
autograph book hand-made in the 
1850s for students to collect each 
other’s signatures. His enthusiasm 
for the Banner (and yearbooks 
in general) is enormous. He will 
probably not buy the 2011 yearbook, 
though—he is less interested in 
modern designs. 
Maybe 
someday, 
a 
future 
collector with an interest in arcane 
class data, quotes, and photos of 
students from 2011 posing against a 
speckled blue background may want 
to buy a copy. 

And someday, the editors 
hope, a new generation will care. 
In the cleaning process, they have 
found that others once did. Lopez 
and her staff unearthed mementos 
of past editors, including several 
oblong concrete blocks with names 
and nicknames painted on them—
clearly part of an inside joke. Now, 
the Banner staff is on the outside. 
Lopez points to them, saying, “See, 
there used to be a culture here. 
These meant something, but I have 
no idea what, so I’m throwing them 
out. We’re starting over.” 

Starting over means an eager but 
novice staff. Lopez, who has never 
edited a yearbook before, asserts, 
“We learn by doing here.” They 
are learning, they say, to get seniors 
to show up for yearbook photos, 
to fill out questionnaires, to offer 
candid photos. They are learning to 
do layout and design, to interact as 
coworkers, and to deal with difficult 
customers: a senior who insists on 
using her own glamour shot instead 
of a professionally taken photo, 
a mother who calls Lopez to find 
out if her son sat for his yearbook 
photo instead of calling the suspect 
himself. 

The staff jokes and exchanges 
Secret Santa gifts, creating new 
traditions to take the place of the 
mysterious blocks. The Banner has 
a culture again, and they’ve tried 
their best to make it different from 
that of the past 168 years. But 
despite clearing out the old boxes 
and shelving thousands of tomes, 
it’s clear that history still weighs on 
them. When they get serious, they 
say they “can’t let the oldest college 
yearbook in the nation die.” 

And if they get their way, 
the Banner won’t. The class of 2011 
will buy their books at $100 each 
and keep them forever—or at least 
sell them to appreciative collectors 
some years down the road.
