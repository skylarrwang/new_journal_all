EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Few know the location of the 
office of the Banner, Yale’s yearbook. 
In fact, many students don’t even 
know that Yale has a yearbook, 
according to Banner senior class 
liason Ryan Carter ’11. So when that 
office was robbed the weekend of 
Safety Dance, the Banner’s six staff 
members were bewildered—first 
walking, then running from room to 
room searching for the two freshly 
delivered Macs (complete with 
Adobe CS5) that had mysteriously 
vanished. “It was right after we 
moved in,” editor-in-chief Evelyn 
Lopez ’11 says. “So we thought at 
first maybe we didn’t remember the 
room correctly. But no…” 

The Macs were never found, 
but all sorts of other things can 
be discovered inside the Banner’s 
office suite, which includes a large 
common room full of couches 
(belonging not to the Banner but to 
Lopez), a coffee table (also Lopez’s), 
a wall of bookshelves stacked with 
Banners, empty wine bottles, empty 
cardboard boxes, an antiquated 
Schwinn bicycle, and a half-
constructed desk. The darkroom 
next door is littered with half-empty 
jugs of processing chemicals and 
possibly valuable but definitely 
unusable photo equipment. There’s 
a future office space in which each 
Banner member has tagged the 
desk where he or she hopes to sit 
one day, a computer room with 
replacement Macs, and an oversized 
storage closet lined almost floor-
to-ceiling with boxes. Each weighs 
at least 60 pounds and contains 
hundreds and hundreds of leftover 
and undelivered yearbooks, as well 
as abandoned copies of Old Campus, 
the yearbook for the freshman class. 

The boxes used to cover the 
floor of the common room. As soon 
as Lopez moved in, she organized 
cleaning and moving days, during 
which Banner staff moved each 
and every box into storage. Lopez’s 
tenure marks the second year that 
students have led the yearbook’s 
production, which was taken over 
in 1995 by the Association of Yale 
Alumni after former Banner staff 
took out a loan of $150,000 for 
equipment, which the publication 
was unable to repay. The loan is 
still outstanding. When Lopez met 
last year’s Banner editors after an 
information session last spring, she 
told them, “Look, I’m not going 
to lie, I want to be editor-in-chief.” 
They agreed, and left their boxes for 
her.

Tidying up the office might 
seem like an odd priority for an 
organization that struggles with lack 
of interest, lack of involvement, 
and lack of funding. In recent 
years, however, the office was so 
neglected that an unidentified man 
once moved in after the spring term 
ended. He slept on a futon in the 
desk-room; he also had several boxes 
full of possessions that he tagged 
with his name. Lopez threw all of 
these items away (well, except the 
futon, which the staff still uses).  At

did. Just as “root” is a borrowing 
from Old Norse, so was Old Norse 
urt a borrowing from Old English 
wyrt.

 There is a third cognate of 
wrod in English as well. This is 
the “rad-” element of words such 
“radical” and “radish.” All words of 
this rough group are derived, in one 
way or another, from the Latin radix, 
“root.” “Radish,” in fact, is a direct 
borrowing from Latin (the stem, or 
base form, of the Latin word was 
radic- with a hard c, changed into 
a “sh”-sound by the Anglo-Saxon 
borrowers). 

Then how did the word 
“radical” become a synonym for 
“extreme” or “divergent”? One 
might think an adjective meaning 
“related to roots” would apply to 
conservative, 
old-fashioned, 
or 
fundamentalist views. Indeed, in 
post-Classical Latin, when radicalis 
came into written use, it originally 
carried the meaning of “primary” 
or “original.”  However, in French, 
the word’s applications ballooned in 
number, and it soon came to mean 
“profound” or “intense”—and from 
“intensity” to modern “radicalism” 
the jump seems not too far at all. 

While the link between modern-
day revolutionaries and a certain red 
vegetable seems unlikely, the names 
for both are well rooted in the past.
