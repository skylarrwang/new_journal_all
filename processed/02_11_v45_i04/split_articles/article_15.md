January 28, 1878, stands 
out in Yale history as the 
birthday of the Yale 	
	
Daily News, the nation’s 	
	
oldest college daily. That 
inaugural News—“justified by the 
dullness of the time and the de-
mand for news among us”—told 
older Elis of local happenings—
incoming Evangelicals, colleagues 
taking leave, and the arrival of fe-
male rowers from Wellesley College. 
(Advertisements informed students 
that “Merle, fashionable barber, the 
most liked of all by the students” 
was closed on Sundays, and 296 
Chapel St. now sold “Delmonico’s 
Cocoanut Cream.”) That same day, 
city residents rang in another era 
in communication, its impact not 
yet discernible to college report-
ers: the District Telephone Com-
pany of New Haven launched the 
world’s first commercial telephone 
exchange. 


In 1877, a telegraph com-
pany manager named George W. 
Coy sat in on a lecture by Alexander 
Graham Bell at Skiff’s Opera House 
in New Haven. Bell’s discussion of 
the implications of the telephone 
on business and trade—and accom-
panying music transmitted over a 
three-way New Haven-Middletown-
Hartford connection—spurred Coy 
into action. A pair of investors and 
a smattering of metal pieces bor-
rowed from ladies’ bustles, carriage 
bolts, and teapot lids allowed Coy 
to whip up a telephone switchboard 
in the Boardman Building, at the 
corner of Chapel and State streets. 
$1.50—in those days, the price of a 
roundtrip to New York on the over-
night steamer “Elm City”—bought 
New Haven residents a month’s sub-
scription to the exchange; iron wire 
strung between housetops, trees, 
and the occasional small pole con-
nected the new Boston-made Bell 
devices. “The Greatest Thing Out! 
Telephone!” ran an advertisement 
in the week-old News. “Can make 
connections with anyone else hav-
ing instrument in the city.” For the 
first time in history, the human voice 
could transcend distance.  


In just a few years, Coy’s 
telephone networks bloomed in 
New Haven and beyond. A Yalie 
with a Cooperative Society card in 
1886 could call from a central cam-
pus phone, which could, according 
to the News,  “furnish us with the 
desired information or impart our 
commands without delay.” The New 
Haven Daily Palladium, a local paper, 
lauded the telephone as a “blessed 
institution” for keeping the city con-
nected through a traffic-and-train-
stopping blizzard in 1888. After 
New Haven, exchanges popped up 
in Hartford and Bridgeport, Boston, 
and New York. By the 1890’s, there 
were over 15,000 telephones in the 
country. 


During the twentieth cen-
tury, the progress of technology 
built sturdier telephone poles and 
put lines underground; now-insu-
lated cables connected disparate 
voices. (By 1925, telephone lines 
stretched for 67.9 million miles 
across the country.) First, copper 
wire and then fiber optics replaced 
iron lines; public phone boxes led 
to rotary dials, touch-tones, and 
cordless handsets. Area codes 
usurped exchange names; satellites 
replaced switchboards. The District 
Telephone Company became the 
Connecticut Telephone Company, 
Connecticut Telephone became 
Southern New England Telephone; 
telecommunications giant AT&T 
came to town in 1998. At first, Yale 
students had a telephone in every 
hall. Soon there was one in every 
room. 

Today, 133 years after Coy set up 
his exchange, the dial tone in 
New Haven is fading. AT&T, which 
employs 5,500 workers in Con-
necticut, lost 150,000 lines in the 
state a little over a year ago.  And 
after laying off 152 state landline 
repair workers last October, it an-
nounced plans in late January to lay 
off 41 additional employees and is 
now facing a $1.1 million fine for 
breaching state service standards 
for landline repairs. 


Soon, the number of 
mobile telephones is expected to 
exceed the number of landlines in 
the nation. AT&T representative 
Chuck Corsey acknowledged that 
while the company has reduced 
jobs in their shrinking wired busi-
ness, it continues to hire in grow-
ing areas—“particularly wireless 
and video.” These days, radio waves 
have replaced wires as our choice 
connectivity medium, as cell phones 
project our voices across and over, 
rather than through, the landscape. 


While landlines continue 
to link the offices and departments 
of Yale, the ringing that once re-
sounded in residences has been 
replaced with techno jingles and 
not-so-indiscreet vibrations, with 
tweets and texts tumbling across 
campus and classrooms. In fall 
2010, students made 17% fewer 
calls off-campus from in-room 
lines than they did in 2009, and 
30% fewer calls than in 2007. Stu-
dents’ numbers might begin with a 
917, 617, 404, or 415, rather than a 
203. While there are no immediate 
plans to phase out the 3,040 land-
lines associated with undergraduate 
residences, the proliferation of cell 
phones is causing ITS to evaluate 
future options, according to David 
Galassi, Yale’s director of network 
services.


Few Yalies know someone 
with a dorm phone installed, but 
you’ll still have to dial through to 
one to reach Jonathan Kreiss-Tom-
kins ’12. The self-described “reso-
lutely parsimonious” student from 
Alaska owns no mobile device, and 
depends on a friend’s room phone 
to stay in touch. “People joke that 
I’m the only one,” he laughed. “In 
some cases it’s inconvenient for 
others, and I feel bad about that,” 
he said. But Kreiss-Tomkins’ result-
ing need to make plans in advance, 
to “be a little more organized and 
on top of it,” suggests that our in-
creasing interconnectivity has its 
casualties. 


By pinning an individual 
to place, the landline phone de-
mands dependability. (It should 
be noted, however, that Kreiss-
Tomkins routes his landline number 
through Google Voice, allowing him 
to receive voicemails wherever he 
brings his laptop.)


According to Paul Need-
ham ’11, when News staff members 
reviewed the landlines assigned to 
202 York St. last summer, they found 
dozens of numbers—some assigned 
to dark rooms, to pasting rooms, 
and even a “lettering room”—that 
had fallen out of use. When Need-
ham was editor-in-chief, reporters 
and editors across town or across 
the building would email or text 
message him to communicate, while 
adults continued to dial his office 
line. Needham professed to like the 
“clear connection” provided by his 
desk phone, but the landline is more 
than just static-free. The wires wo-
ven in the walls of the News, active 
and inactive, serve as lines between 
generations of students’ profes-
sional and personal lives, grounded 
in purpose.


In Bell’s original telephone 
transmitter, sound waves produced 
the electrical energy to work the de-
vice. Now, though, hastily composed 
messages displace voices from the 
communication process, sacrificing 
sound for convenience. Perhaps in 
New Haven, the birthplace of the 
commercial telephone exchange, we 
feel the loss of the dial tone more 
strongly—or perhaps we can accept 
that a beloved hometown tradition is 
coming to an end.
