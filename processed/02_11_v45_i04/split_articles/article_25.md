Sticky-fingered 
kids 
waiting in line at Bishop’s 
Orchards tugged at their 
parents’ pants, demanding more 
caramel apples. Outside, more 
children roamed, trying to pick 
up pumpkins too heavy for them 
to lift. It was a sunny afternoon, 
the first Saturday in October, and 
crowds had gathered to celebrate 
the apple harvest at the farm and 
market in Guilford, Connecticut. 
Two little girls sang to the tune of 
Frère Jacques, as their father pushed 
them in a wheelbarrow: “We are 
pumpkins, we are pumpkins, eat us 
quick! Eat us quick!” Other families 
stood at long tables, stuffing old 
clothes with straw and decorating 
them with bits of yarn to make 
scarecrows. An older woman walked 
by, singing softly: “You are the apple 
of my eye.”

Arriving 
at 
Bishop’s 
that October afternoon, I felt at 
home. A Connecticut native, I 
spent my childhood among the 
trees of Applegate of Avon, an 
orchard owned and operated by 
my onetime babysitter, Nancy 
Hanelius, and her husband, Ray 
in Avon, Connecticut. I can still 
remember the dark, cool, cavernous 
room where apples were stored. The 
Hanelius family has since sold their 
farm, and uniform, colonial-style 
houses now stand where apples once 
grew. Their story is not unusual. 
Since 2000, Connecticut’s annual 
apple production has dropped by 2 
million pounds. Bishop’s Orchards, 
however, has managed to continue 
operating.

“It’s a neat place,” said Jim 
Plunkett, a Guilford native who 
attended the town’s high school 
with Bishop’s current CEO, Keith 
Bishop. “They have been around 
forever. They are a Guilford fixture.”

The Bishops have owned 
and operated Bishop’s Orchards for 
six generations, since 1871. They 
steered the farm through the Great 
Depression and the construction of 
Interstate 95 in the 1950s through 
a swath of what had been Bishop 
land. The small children making 
scarecrows that day owed their fun 
to a long tradition that now rests 
on the shoulders of Keith’s four

Sixth Generation
S
arah 
Bishop-Dellaventura 
loves apples. For her October 
wedding—“I had to get married 
during prime-time foliage”—her 
centerpieces 
were 
apples. 
Her 
party favors were two hundred jars 
of applesauce, homemade by her 
grandmother. Her place settings were 
colored leaves, and her decorations 
included mums and pumpkins. She 
would have held the ceremony in 
the apple orchard, if it weren’t for 
the potential problems a Porta-potty 
poses to a wedding gown. 

When I asked Sarah her 
favorite type of apple, she didn’t 
think twice. “My favorite, and 
probably everybody else’s,” she said, 
“is Macoun.” We were standing just 
inside the entrance of the grocery 
store at Bishop’s Orchards, which 
stocks grass-fed beef, gluten-free 
cookies, local vegetables, and organic 
frozen foods alongside the bakery 
breads, fudge, pies, fruit wines, 
apple cider, and, of course, the fruit. 
Sarah explained that the produce 
section is here, at the front, because 
this store started as a farmer’s market 
and produce remains at its heart. 
At the forefront of the 
produce section are the apples. 
All grown at Bishops’ Orchards, 
they come in rows, in big white 
sacks, and in every variety. Copies 
of a green Xeroxed sheet, titled 
“Know your apples,” sit at the 
ready, categorizing the qualities of 
16 varieties of apple and the fitness 
of each to eating, salad, pie, sauce, 
baking, and canning. On the reverse 
are nutritional facts about apples, 
paragraphs titled “Apples Relieve 
Tension” and “Nature’s Toothbrush,” 
and a recipe for applesauce. 
Here, at the front of the 
apple section, are the Macouns. 
“You bite into it and get that snap 
right away,” said Sarah. “A great 
eating apple.” They sell out quickly. 
“As soon as we start saying we have 
Macouns,” she continued, “people 
come out of the woodwork to get 
them.” With a sharp eye for these 
trends and a degree in business
