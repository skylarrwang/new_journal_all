some with "Culbro" emblazoned on the 
side-drive into the Culb.rv farm on Babbs 
Road in West Suffield. The entrance to the 
farm is a dirt road. Beyond the "No Trespass-
ing" sign hundreds of workers unload from 
the vehicles in a haze of dust. 


We drive 30 yards past the "No Trespass-
ing" sign to where me workers ace unloading. 
A small wooden building to the left has a 
number of cars parked in front of it. We stop 
there and get out. Amazed that we've gotten 
as far as we have without being stopped, we 
decide to push our luck, asking a man stand-
ing outside the building for the manager. The 
man takes us inside the single-story building. 
Signs on the door ace in both English and 
Spanish. In a room with one desk against the 
wall, we are introduced to a manager of the 
farm, a portly man With thinning gray hair 
and yellow-stained teeth. We tell him we 
would like to see what happens on the farm 
and what the workers do. He gives a laugh 
several times during our conversation even 
though no jokes have been told. It seems like 
a nervous laugh. We wonder if he's thinking 
about a New Haven Advocate article earlier in 
the week which quoted a lawyer for Culbro 
denying that the farm hired any workers from 
New Haven. Another manager, an older man 
with a cowboy hat, walks into the room. He 
seems less interested in talking to us. Neither 
manager offers his name. but they are willing 
to talk about the farm. The older manager 
responds tersely when ask,.'ed whether the 
workers cause problems. "Does a school 
teacher have problems with his children?" he 
asks us. Shortly afterward, he walks outside. 
The other manager is more willing to help us 
and offers to drive us arQWld the farm. 


We climb into his truck and sit next ro 
him. We learn that on this day 280 workers, a 
typical number, ace out in the fields and sheds 
where the tobacco leaves are stored. He does 
not need to recruit. Aside from the work they 
do on his farm, he claims not to know about 
other aspects of their lives, including where 
they live. 


After a few minutes, he stops at one of the 
many sheds on the farm. The manager walks 
inside as we wait outside by his truck. At the 
side of the shed, we recognize the man with 
the earring who was sitting on the apartment 
building stoop in Fair Haven early this morn-
ing. He sees us but does not show any recog-
nition, continuing his work. The manager 
comes back and we take off. 


As we drive, we get the feeling that the 
manager is particularly glad about three 
things: the size of the farm, the booming cigar 
market, and our company this morning. Since 
June, he has been working the harvest seven 
days a week from 4:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. 
Every day he drives 300 to 350 miles around 
the 141-acre farm to make sure everything is 
running okay. As we drive, he points to the 
tobacco plants in the fields: ·~ready sold. 
People are crying for it." Culbro is a division 
of General Cigar Co., owned by the huge 
Culbro Corporation. "We make more cigars 
than anyone else," he says. 


We see workers standing next to rows of 
tobacco. Normally they would be picking, but 
today there is a shortage of buckets in which 
to load the leaves. In the truck, the manager 
gives orders over his walkie-talkie to his subor-
dinates to get the buckets right away. 


The manager pulls the van up to one of 
the sheds where workers sew tobacco leaves. 
From the outside, it looks like a big barn, 
about the area of a tennis court with a high 
roo£ The shed is filled with the sounds of 75 
working laborers: shouting mixed with the 
methodical drone of sewing machines. 


Dozens of men, women, and children with 
yellow, light-blue, and orange construction 
helmets are bent over buckets. Others ~ 
leaves together, while some baJance precari-
ously high up on beams in the roo£ Sun 
streaming in through small h&les in the ceil-
ing illuminates the fine dust which fills the air. 


The manager introduces us to the shed's ~ 
supervisor, Mark. Meanwhile our guide for !!!. 
the day walks around observing the operation. 


Mark takes us over to one of the 12 or so 
sewing tables in the shed to explain how the 
process works. One or rwo people place tobac-
co leaves on the tables while others insert the 
leaves into sewing machines. Beside the 
machines are charts with the workers' identifi-
cation numbers, which are entered into a com-
puter in the central office. The charts keep 
track of the amount of time and work done. 


The workers are not required to work seven 
days a week, but if they do not show up for 
three days in a row, the computer automatical-
ly erases their names and they are fired. 


After the tobacco leaves are sewn onto 
racks, the racks must be lifted to the shed's 
ceiling for drying. We see boys, who look no 
older than 14, standing one above the other 
on narrow wooden beams. Referred to as 
"hangers," they are lifting the racks of tobacco 
leaves to the top of the shed by passing them 
up from one to the other. Mark tells us that 
sometimes the beams break and the boys 
catch themsdves by grabbing the beam above 
them to avoid falling. The boys take turns 
because they get tired. Mark proudly reports 
that none of his boys have gotten hurt, 
though at other farms he has heard that they 
have. 


Although dangerous, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Labor classifies this kind of work as 
legal for 14-year-olds, the youngest workers 
allowed on the f.um. Jim Peckham, Wage and

Hour Division investigator, says that under 
agricultural rules these teenagers cannot drive 
tractors but can perform this task of balancing 
on fragile wooden beams. 


Using 14-year-old boys for this job is not 
the only way in which Culbro clings closely to 
the letter of the law. The $6.30 per hour wage 
that Culbro farm pays its workers is below the 
"prevailing wage" of $6.71 per hour deter-
mined by federal officials in Washington, D.C. 
The prevailing wage must be adhered to by 
farms participating in the federal H-2A pro-
gram, which allows those with an insufficient 
supply of U.S. workers to attain special visas for 
foreign workers. The ptevailing wage is meant 
to protect U.S. laborers from the extremely low 
wages for which the foreign laborers may be 
willing to work. 


However, the Culbro farm does not partic-
ipate in the H-2A program and does not claim 
an insufficient number of U.S. workers, says 
Walter Montes, who handles the program in 
Connecticut for the U.S. Depanment of 
Labor. Because migrant workers arrive en 
masse at Culbro every summer and because 
Culbro's workers must show at least rwo forms 
of photo identification as proof that they are 
legal before they start work, their fieldhands are 
considered U.S. workers. "My assumption is 
that one of the reasons Culbro is not participat-
ing is that they do not want to pay their work-
ers the prevailing wage," Montes says. 


Although it is only a $0.4 i difference, after two 
months of the tobacco harvest, the estimated 
280 workers have accumulated a total of 
$64,288 less than they would have received at 
an H-2A farm. 


In addition, under the H-2A program, 
unlike at the Culbro f.um, employers must 
provide transportation between the workers' 
living quarters and the employer's work sire 
without cost to the worker, if the living quar-
ters are reasonably far from the farm. Montes 
says that the distance to the Culbro farm from 
Fair Haven would be considered reasonably far. 


At the end of the summer, the money that 
the migrant workers rake home is far more 
than they would make in Mexico or other 
Latin American countries for the same work. 
But along their journey from their home coun-
tries, then from the South up to Connecticut, 
then from their temporary quarters in areas like 
New Haven to the f.um, and all the way back, 
various people nibble at their earnings. Migrant 
workers who come to New Haven may already 
have considerable debt. Those who cross the 
border illegally often become indebted ro 
smugglers. Drivers charge them $200 for trans-
portation to Connecticut and $20 a week for 
taking them to the farms. New Haven migrant 
workers have said that the reason they are taken 
to live far from the farm is exactly so that the 
drivers can make more money. Their run-
down homes are ill-equipped for storing food, 
so they must buy breakfast and lunch, which 
costs at least $8 per day. Their rent ranges from 
$600 to $1,500 per month split among the 30 
or so people living in each apartment. With 
what is left, the workers support their families 
who either live temporarily in New Haven or 
remain in Latin America. 


After a while in the shed, we separate from 
Mark, who walks around talking to workers. 
We approach some of them ourselves. One 
woman, who loads tobacco leaves into a sewing 
machine, says she comes from Mexico. She 
explains that one day last week the shed was 
closed because of the dust. "Nobody could 
breathe in here," she says. "It was real bad." 
Our conversations with the workers are cut off 
by the manager, who fetches us and says it is 
time to go. 


Leaves liner the floor and the manager is 
upset. "There's no reason these leaves should be 
falling," he says to Mark on the way out. He 
reveals his agitation with Mark, comparing him 
to a Puerto Rican supervisor in a more orga-
nized shed. "The funny thing is I got the white 
guy in there and the Puerto Rican guy here and 
the Puerto Rican guy's doing better." We get 
back in the manager's truck and drive toward 
his office. 


A
t noon, the workers are given a 30-
rninute lunch break. Workers from the 
fields pile into gteen Culbro buses to 
escape the sun. They eat the food purchased at 
the Cirgo station earlier in the morning. Under 
federal law, there are no required meal breaks 
for the migrant workers. If not for Connecticut 
state law, which requires the 30-minuce meal 
break for all laborers working more than seven 
and a half hours, the f.um could work them 24 
hours a day, seven days a week. 


The workers are not given another break 
until 5:30p.m., this time for 15 to 30 minutes. 
Each receives a McDonald's hamburger, a bag 
of potato chips, and a Pepsi, all paid for by Cui-
bro. The workers used to get french fries in 
addition to their burgers but it was costing the 
farm $1,1 00 per day, less than $4 per worker 
but more than Culbro wanted to spend. By 
eliminating the fries, Culbro slashed their food 
costs in half, down to less than $2 per worker. 


After eating, the workers rerum to the fields 
and sheds. 


Usually the f.um closes for the day at 8 p.m. 
The migrant workers climb back into their 
vans, cars, and buses for the commute home.

Those going to New Haven prepare for their 
hour-and-a-half ride after an exhausting day. 


t night we visiS some of the migrant 
workers who have returned from work 
to Fair Haven. Leaning on the dilapi-
dated railing of a porch, one young Mexican 
man, who declined to give his name, seems 
used to the smell of the raw sewage seeping out 
into the warm air from his Fillmore Street 
house. He wears a soiled green polo shirt, blue-
jeans more black than blue, and he looks tired. 
Curious but shy, he seems to hide behind a 
pole on the porch. He has picked tobacco since 
July and shares his excitement with us at the 
prospect of returning to see his family in Chia-
pas, Mexico. 


A woman from Guatemala, who also lives 
in this house, stands on the porch next to the 
man from Chiapas while her four children play 
in the street. She has specks of gray in her dark 
hair and wears a homemade blouse, brown 
with dirt. An elderly white neighbor of theirs 
makes her way slowly down the street toward 
them carrying bags of groceries. She stops to 
speak to the children. "Nice day," she says as 
she pulls cookies from one of her grocery bags 
and gives them to the children. "They are nice 
people," she says of her-neighbors as she smiles. 
"Sometimes I feel real sorry for them." She 
walks slowly away to her house next door and 
disappears inside. 


Meanwhile, the children quickly munch 
the cookies and their smiles reveal sets of rot-
ten teeth. When asked if they can speak Eng-
lish, the two girls nod their heads eagerly. They 
explain that they will rerum to Florida with 
their mother and father in a few weeks to 
resume school. Their mother watches cau-
tiously from the front porch, unable to speak 
English. When asked where they consider 
their homes to be, the girls quickly answer, 
"Florida." They have lived there for ten years, 
they say, but traVel in the summer to places 
where their father can find better work. They 
hope their father, who is working in the Con-
necticut tobacco fields, will return home from 
work soon. Afrer finishing their cookies, they 
run off laughing. For them, this day is liktMI 
other.
