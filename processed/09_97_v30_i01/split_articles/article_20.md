T
he housing proctor called out the name of my future roommate. 
She calmly walked to the front of the Morse library and surveyed 
the fan of cards offered to her. Her eyes ran across them twice. 
She took a deep breath. 
Every student in the Morse class of 1999 stood in the room last April 
tensely awaiting the outcomes of the housing lottery. Each group of 
prospective roommates had appointed a representative who was to par-
ticipate in a game of chance. The selection of a single card would deter-
mine which suite was to be banished to Old Campus annex housing. We 
waited as my roommate prepared to select the card containing our fare. 
Anyone familiar with the phenomenon of Yale housing draws has 
seen or experienced a scene like this. Droves of frightened students cluster 
into small groups like cattle waiting to be slaughtered; neither cunning 
nor caution can spare them. Luck rules supremely and indiscriminately. 
In anticipation of this event, students scramble to mold themselves 
into perfect rooming material. This process includes paring down groups 
of friends into convenient numbers or hunting down those gullible 
unfottunates willing to take a double. 
Unfortunately, the hunger for the perfect room often brings out a 
student's ugly side. I have seen secret plots to oust roommates and suites 
split into rival factions. Some become so blinded by their goal that they 
are willing to do anything to achieve it. One Stiles student was so des-
perate for a single room that he posted signs offering a television and a 
bicycle in exchange for a place in a suite with an open single. Friendships 
crash and burn; tension created by the housing process amplifies the 
tiniest pet peeves, nurturing them into bitter animosity. I know a group 
of Morse women who refused to live with a roommate again simply 
because she would constantly lock the phone in her bedroom. More 
shouting matches occur during the weeks before the draw than any 
other time of year.

Not all students cope with the stress of housing in the same way, of 
course. Men and women react very differently. Every year at the housing 
draw I see men cheering the misfortunes of others, while women superficially 
console one another. Men seize the rare opportunity to go to war. 
They become self-preservational and combative. Wary of commitment, 
they end up in small groups. Men are unwilling to, as Ben Franklin said, 
"hang together." Women, on the other hand, are too afraid to "hang sep-
arately." Impractical groups of ten or 12 women are common. We hate to 
say no. What kind of bitch would reject her own roommate?-well, at 
least to her face. The gender gap is alive and well, thanks to the Yale 
housing draw. 
My group had managed to avoid these pitfalls. We numbered five 
women, a conveniently small, but not too small, number. Other students 
eager to join us and other groups looking to relieve us of a member made 
us offers, but we had the self-possession to politely decline. And most 
importantly, we managed to keep our friendships intact. Never once did 
any of us, roommates and friends since freshman year, let discussion 
about rooming plans affect how we felt about each other. 
So we were set-or so we thought. All we had to worry about was 
the night of the draw. Our overcrowded class of 1999 needed to squeeze 
into every available bed in Morse, but even that was not enough; the fifth 
floor of Durfee was opened as a junior annex. My roommates and I knew 
this part of Durfee, or the Gables, as it is popularly known, quite well. 
We had lived there freshman year. It had fantastic suites, with vaulted 
ceilings, skylights, and the biggest common rooms at Yale. It was well 
worth the steep five-flight climb. 
Every suite in our class had an equal chance of being annexed, but 
the five of us considered ourselves immune. What were the odds of being 
placed in the same room twice? We planned on a fresh start for the new 
year, a comfortable suite in Morse College near our friends. Durfee was

And now, at the crowded housing lottery, our fate was about to be 
determined. My roommate's eyes lingered on the cards. Finally, she thrust 
her hand to one and pulled it from the rest. After a barely perceptible hes-
itation she turned it over, gazing at its face with a blank expression. 
She held the card up for all to see. 
"Two of spades!" cried the housing proctor. I sank into my chair. The 
two of spades! A sympathetic murmur, tinged with relief, ran through the 
room. Such a low card could mean only one thing: the annex. Morse 
annexed us to the same suite we had lived in two years before. It was 
almost as if an invisible hand had reached down and erased all the time 
that had elapsed. I was to be a naive freshman once again, moving onto 
Old Campus, wondering who my friends would be, which classes to 
pick. Every room, every corner, every footfall would remind me of an old 
flame, an old argument, an estranged friend. The memories seemed 
insurmountable. 
A summer later, it was moving day. I let out a sigh as I looked up at 
Durfee. Lapsing into an old habit, I craned my neck to try to see my 
rooftop window. I lugged my first box up the familiar five flights. As I 
approached the top, wheezing, I cursed each step. But the steps had 
known me for a long time; I'm sure they understood. Finally, I reached 
the summit and strode into the old suite. I was immediately over-
whelmed by the size of the common room. The ceiling seemed to stretch 
into infinity. Light bounced off the walls. A breeze swirled about, so fresh 
I could smell it; someone must have already arrived and opened the win-
dows. 
As I looked around the room, I visualized our old furniture arrange-
ment. The TV there, the pink chair there. When I pictured our favorite 
blue couch I could almost see my younger self sitting on it. I remem-
bered holding a camcorder, videotaping my friends as they did inane

things. They moved in and out of the frame self-consciously, laughing,  
making bad jokes. "Are you hungry?" one boy asked the camera. Then,  
as if it were a person, he tried to feed it a cookie. 
I shifted my gaze to the corner of the common room and again I saw 
a sort of apparition, recalling a memory long forgotten. I saw myself 
studying for Art History 115 at 6 a.m., only hours before the final. A 
roommate and I, both in the same class, had crafted a miniature mural 
made up of every painting we were required to identify. 
"What's this one?" she fired, pointing to a tiny picture. 
"Um ... no wait, I know this ... Girl Under Japan Umbrella, by ... 
Kirchner, 1909!" 
My reverie was broken as one of my roommates emerged from her 
room. We squealed and hugged each other in delight. Obligatory how- 
was-your-summer-mine-was-fine's followed. Then we trailed off into a 
strange silence. After a moment I turned to find her gazing about the 
room, as was I. 
"It's not how I thought it would be, being back here," I offered. 
"Me neither," she replied. 
Another silence. "Do you remember when we bought the Christmas 
tree? It was covered with ice, and we had to drag it all the way up here. It 
was so beautiful when we finished decorating it, though, wasn't it?" We 
both smiled at the memory, which led to another, then another. As we 
reminisced a kind of weight lifted from my chest. Perhaps our history in 
this great room would not hold us back. We would join our old memo-
ries with our future ones in a way no other Yale student could. 
"You know, this might not be so bad, after all," my friend said. 
I agreed. It might not be so bad.
