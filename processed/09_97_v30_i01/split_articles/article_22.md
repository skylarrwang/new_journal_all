Coup at the Co·op 
The Co-op has been ousted. 
Let the revolution begin! 
by Alec Hanley Bemis 
P
resident Harry Berkowitz answers his phone. "Execu-
tive offices ... ?" No answer. "Executive offices ... ?" No 
answer. There are problems with the phone lines but this 
kind of thing is to be expected in the midst of a revolution. 
Berkowitz, the leader of the Yale Co-op, sits in his fifth-floor bunker 
at 900 Chapel Street, right off the New Haven Green. He is just set-
cling into the command center of the Yale Co-op's provisional business 
offices and, as with any new base of operations, there. are some kinks to 
be worked out. 


Appealing to the public's perpetual fascination with civic unrest, the 
Co-op began touting its new revolutionary program via Byers and 
advertisements placed at strategic points throughout New Haven. 
"Stop by sometime and hatch a plot to overthrow the bourgeois capital-
ist elite," the Co-op's new slogan invites. The tag line is illustrated with 
the disembodied head of a sunglasses- and beret-dad rendition of the 
archetypical revolutionary Vladimir llyich Lenin. While this slogan is 
considerably less fiery than your run-of-the-mill leftist insurgent broad-
side--one would expect something more along the lines of"Workers of 
the world unite, and shop!"-it is a manifesto well in keeping with the 
liberation marketing sweeping America's corporate promotion depart-
ments. Drink Mountain Dew and gain the self-confidence to cliff-dive 
with your closest friends. Wear Reeboks and join in their declaration 
for Human Rights Now!TM Buy guava-avocado moisturizer at the Body 
Shop and help save the 19 Ogoni tribesmen whom Nigeria's military 
dictatorship plans to send to the gallows. Scarf down a pint of Ben and 
Jerry's Rain Forest Crunch TM and keep the ozone in place one more 
day. Yeah, right. Right? 


In the case of the Co-op's new marketing stratagem, however, there 
may just be something behind the revolutionary rhetoric. The Co-op 
was ousted from its long-time Broadway location next to Morse and 
Stiles this past June after Yale leased the building to Barnes & Noble, 
which opened the Yale Bookstore, the latest in the corporation's line of 
college bookstores. The Co-op, unlike the new Yale Bookstore, is 
owned by members who actually shop there, not far-off shareholders. 
In fact, at times the Co-op even manages to pay its members a small 
dividend, something that the Barnes & Noble establishment will never 
do, no maner how high the profit margins run. 


When Yale handed the Co-op over to Barnes & Noble, it was 
another blow against the locally-owned character of the Broadway 
strip. What was once a street marked by a cheesy local dance dub, a 
buffalo wing dive, and a small office supply store is 
.::::: slowly but surely being turned into a battleground 
where Au Bon Pain and Bruegger's pit their corporate 
bagels against one another in a dance to the death. As the 
posters in ABP tell us to grab for sourdough bagels with a chocolate 
swirl and as Bruegger's lures us in to try out an Herby Turkey™ meal 
. deal, the Co-op is, in a way, fighting for the voice of the people. 


Take a short stroll inside the new Co-op, now entrenched in the 
Chapel Square Mall, and you will discover that the revolutionary aes-
thetic has been taken a step beyond advertising pitches. The new Co-
op is a reasonable simulacrum of a revolutionary headquarters under 
siege: wires dangle from unfinished light fixtures, shelves remain bare 
as an obvious casualty of the breakdown in supply lines, and £!le newly 
constructed mezzanine level connecting the first and second floors 
remains definitively unfinished perhaps due to a lack of building sup-
plies and proletarian spirit. The only thing missing in the Co-op's new 
makeover are USSR-style lines at the checkout aisles. 


Despi~ the relatively disheveled appearance of the store, there are 
signs that the Co-op may make it through the long hard winter 
months. First of all, this is a case of a revolutionary administration 
actually managing to make the trains run on time. The Co-op has 
rented its very own trolley on wheels to shunle students to their new. 
location and indoctrinate them at their leisure. Judging by the texts in 
the course book section-it's packed with tracts for classes taught by 
left-leaning professors such as labor historian David Montgomery and 
"Roots of Radicalism" professor Emilia Vioni da Costa-the Co-op 
also has a dedicated cadre of freedom fighters among its ranks of sup-
porters. 


Perhaps the most obvious question to ask of all this talk of revolu-
tion, is this: How exactly does a business that has been the reigning 
power in student retail for 113 years end up in charge of the revolu-
tion? Aren't small but feisty bands of dissatisfied citizens the ones who 
lead revolts? 


Berkowitz, following in the rhetoric of the 1930s Communist 
International, puts it this way, "We have to retrain people to walk to a 
different location, to travel in a new direction, to walk a different way, 
to follow us." While all this talk of gaining fellow travelers may strike 
perspicacious readers as a bit arch, the Co-op hopes that its bohemian 
brand identity will keep its leadership from succumbing to a corporate 
coup d'!tat.
