H, DEAR, I WISH I WERE THERE 
instead of in this New Haven 
that I never did and never shall 
like," Thornton Wilder sighed in a letter to 
Gertrude Stein on the seventh of June 1938. 
The letter is now published among The Letters 
of Gertrude Stein and Thornton Wilder, a work 
containing the correspondence from 1934 ·to 
1946 of this literary Caseor and Pollux. Or 
rather, Jack Sprat and spouse, for Wilder and 
Stein had little in common excepting their 
fume. Their utterly different styles are arranged 
next to each other in this volume as point and 
counterpoint, but the dialogue is little like a 
correspondence in the true sense of that word. 
There is no accord or conformity to their epis-
tolary effortS; one letter does not provide the 
analogue for its answer. 


On the seventh of June, Stein was presiding 
over the domus she shared with Alice B. Toklas 
outside of Paris in Bilignin, doting on her pup 
Basket, lunching with the Picabias, and strug-
gling to publish. Wilder was berween engage-
ments. He roosted momentarily at the home of 
his mother and sisters on Deepwood Drive. In 
his letter he yearns himself out of New Haven 
to the place they are, casting out to "Gertralici-
tude" with a series of rhetorical questions. 
Aie you all well? 
And the dogs? 
And Madame Giroud and Ia baronne? 
Are you driving carefully around the funher 
side of the Lake? 
Are you honking devastatingly in from of 
the bread, butter, and vegetable shops? 
Are the paths in great need of attention? 
Gestures from this same school of longing-
for transportation, for alternative experience--
filled my letters of this summer, from this New 
Haven that I never did like (no, it's not truly so, 
but for the sake of identity with Gertrude's 
"Thomi dear") to the far reaches of the postal 
service. The Thornton Wtl.der stamps that 
facilitated my armchair traveling, in this cen-
tennial year of his birth, heightened my iden-
tification with his mad wavings and blown 
kisses. My letters reached Costa Rica and 
Switzerland, Greece and Italy, along with 
Wilder's round wire specs. We were a pair of 
yoyeurs. 


Neither Wilder -nor l meant truly or only 
that we wished to be in Italy, Costa Rica, 
Bilignin. The voyeur-par-avian intends some- . 
thing a little bit more. The impulse to write, 
"Oh, dear, I wish t were there instead of here" 
is a more sociable, acceptable way of writing 
"Oh, dear, I wish I were you, where you are 
reading this account of me." Letter-writing is a 
form of travel that moves at once toward the 
letter's destination and into the psyche of the 
person reading the letter. 


In those pauses, hand on the coffee. cup, pen 
bleeding on the quilt, when I consider the next 
phrase to turn or event to chronicle, the reverie 
is one of my own life and the life of the person 
who will read the letter. When I write letters, 
the reader's voice ricochetS through my brain. 
My representations are based on how it is that I 
imagine they imagine me. Through and with 
them I experience vicariously my degree of sar-
casm or wistfulness or bravado. In letters, as 
perhaps in no other literary form, one crafts a 
self for a reader with complete intentionality 
and transparency. The letter is the confluence 
of the journal and the novella, autobiographical 
and fictional, and panicular to a single reader. 


A letter takes its form from its occasion. The 
self that it constructs is created to impact the 
reader in a specific way, to impart certain tid-
bits, omit others. My thank-you notes are chip-
per and sturdy without fail. Love letters at once 
guarded and swollen with description. Letters 
to long-lost friends both tentative and intimate; 
to strangers, humble with a sl_ow drip of irony. 


It is important to remember m reading the let-
ters that passed berween Wilder and Stein that 
there was an agenda to these letters as well, 
determining in more and less subtle ways the 
matter of each letter. 


The Wtl.der-Stein correspondence was not a 
spontaneous bloom of love and admiration 
that developed organically alongside a flesh-
and-blood friendship. They began their 
exchange nearly as strangers, gushing from the 
get-go. The number of times in their lives that 
they saw each other lagged far behind the num-
ber of letters that they wrote back and forth. 
Though Wtl.der read Stein's work attentively, 
by his estimate she only ever read Heaven's My 
Destination.

Wilder's position as the darling of the Amer-
ican literary scene gave Stein a pragmatic rea-
son for pursuing a relationship with the 
younger writer. She sought publication ardent-
ly; Wtl.der had his finger on the pulse. He liter-
ally introduced Stein, more than once writing 
the foreword to a book of hers which made it 
publishable and saleable. The editors of the col-
lection explicate this dynamic in a footnote. 
Stein and Wtl.der played elaborate parts in a 
~ 
relationship. Wtl.der, well connected, 
succrssful, and expert at popularizing ideas, 
helped to introduce Stein's work ro resistant 
American readers in books that might not 
have been published without his interven-
tion: the Namllitm lectures, the GrographicaJ 
Hiswry of America. and, after her death, Four 
in Ammca. Wtlder in rum gained greatly 
from Srein's friendship and from the power 
of her mind to free him from excessive con-
straints. 


It seems dear from the nature of their let-
ters and from the objective knowledge of their 
respective prospects, that despite this editorial 
attempt to demonstrate reciprocity, and despite 
Wt.lder's own excessive protestations of how 
much he owed Stein, Stein had more to gain 
from her pen pal than he had from her. 


Stein often hinted at ways beyond writing 
introductions that Wtlder could be of help to 
her. Using his connections in Hollywood 
would do wonders: 
we just want to run around and do nothing 
and be payed largely for it ... it is a pleasant 
xtravagance and we are just pining for pleas-
ant xrravagance, so keep your eyes and ears 
open, if they want us we will come, we 
would love to be payed largely and we are 
tired of just staying here and beside it is 
becoming roo high to live in Europe like 
that, we are nutting in the woods and then 
Alice makes cakes of the nuts, which is a 
pleasant life too, but a vacance paye and it 
might be with you dear Thornton and lots 
oflove 
Gtde. 


There was a certain utility to the relation-
ship that Stein leaves ~biguous. She steadi-
ly insists on "collaboration" with Wtlder: 
will you but you would never say no to me 
but wiU you really will you, ever since my 
earliest days when I read Erckman Chatri-
an's !'Ami Fritz. in what language I do not 
know I have loved the word collaborate and 
I always always wanted to and now wiU you 
oh Thornton will you coUaborate on Ida the 
Novel, we must do it together not now like 
you did the commentaries and the other 
[facsimile ...... ?] but really and really and 
truly just like Erckman and Chatrian, a real-
ly truly novel is too much for me all alone 
we must do it together. 


It cannot have been far from Stein's thoughts 
that Wtlder had by this time won the first of 
his three Pulitzer prizes {for The Bridge of San 
Luis &y, 1928). He had earned both fortune 
and a place in the rarefied circle of American 
letters. Co-authorship would ensure publica-
tion. 


Wt.lder's motivations are less scrutable. He 
certainly took inspiration from his conversa-
tions with Stein, and more importandy from 
his reading of her work. 
I can no longer conceal from you that I am 
writing the mosr beautiful little play you can 
imagine.... This play is an immersion, 
immersion into a New Hampshire town. It's 
SEPTEMBER 5, 1997 
called "Our Town" and its third acr is based 
on your ideas, as on great pillars, and whether 
you know it or nor, until further notice, 
you're in a deep-knit coUaboration already. 


This was the kind of collaboration in which 
Wtlder was interested: digestion and reformula-
tion of ideas raised by Stein. She was in charge of 
metaphysics, he wrote. He attributes the philo-
sophical basis for Our Town to The Making of 
Americans. But the fact that Wt.lder did not want 
anything per se from Stein does not mean that 
their relationship was useless to him. The dis-
tinction remains that his work profited, while 
Stein may have sought profit in a more concrete 
sense. 


This difference between them is legible. 
W1Jder's are the letters of an interested reader 
and scholar of Stein's work, who wrote both in 
exploration of these ideas and for the sake of 
writing itsel£ Wtlder's letters also carried out a 
social courtesy, responding to the attentions of 
the famed Miss Stein. There is, on the other 
hand, an urgency about Stein's letters which her 
characteristic open syntax-non-syntax--exac-
erbates. Every letter documents a want, a need, a 
desperate please please please, don't say don't say 
no. Stein's letters demand (contacts, favors, 
American books, visits by Wtlder), while 
Wilder's deflect, reflect, and describe. The result 
is that a letter by Wtlder is vaguely intoxicating, 
piquant, deft. A Stein letter reads like a water-
drinking COntest. 


The roles they played were staged, or one 
might say, written. They defined themselves 
along the slanting, smeared border of ink where 
their relationship was born and where it ulci-
matdy died. Stein was the genius of the faraway 
place of ideas who could not negotiate the world 
of commercial literature on her own; Wt.lder was 
the snappy student v0to could spin the big ideas 
into marketable litde packages. These are the 
selves that they constructed and, through the 
course of their correspondence, conspired to 
nunure. 


Their correspondence broke off suddenly, due 
in part to the exigencies of World War 11-
Wilder was serving as a lieutenant colond and 
Stein was in occupied France-and in part to 
Wtlder's failure to write back. Stein died. Wtlder 
had not written. In his letter of condolence to 
Alice (dated October 8, 1946, over two months 
after Stein's death) Wilder excuses himself with a 
piece of wisdom gleaned from Gertrude: 
My poignant self-reproach at not having 
wrinen her is acute. It doesn't help that I 
remember that she taught me how all those 
audience-acriviries--" anicles," 
lener-writ-
ing, and conversation itself are impure at the 
source. 


Post-facto, when his correspondent can no 
longer respond, Wtlder admits what every 
letter-writer knows: that the reader is an 
audience, that the written self is a mere per-
formance.
