EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Yale is at this moment thigh-deep in 
the semesterly phenomenon of 
shopping period, a ten-day experience 
which is at worst a crash course-- in 
contingency and at best a drive 
through higher education's Napa 
Valley. We shop-
pers sample the 
sweets; we hover, 
plunge, and dart 
off fast. Of this 
practice-this 
dabbling 
and 
momentary dilettan-
tism which allows the 
Engineering 
major 
to 
entertain for one moment 
the thought of Kundera-
University of Virginia Professor 
Mark Edmundson (GRD '85) has a 
thing or two to say. In a recent Harp-
er's article, complaining of the market 
sensibility that dominates American 
universities, he wrote: "The common 
term for this time span-~hopping 
period-speaks volumes about the 
consumer mentality that's now in 
play." 

Edmundson paints a picture of the 
climate of university life that is 
designed to depress. He depicts under-
graduates as the dull, sad vehicles of 
commercial culture, desirous only of 
pleasure's gentle lullaby, to be fol-
lowed by a sugarplum future in the 
suburban middle class. We are, in his 
view, slogging through our days, our 
edges softened by just enough TV to 
keep us from committing suicide. We 
are utterly dispassionate. 

This is an uncomfortable image to 
any student, but not in the way that 
Edmundson intends. It is objection-
able not because he pushes us toward a 
painful self-recognition, but precisely 
because what he writes does not ring 
true. Students act like customers, true 
enough, but not to the detriment of 
Yale as a place of intellectual rigor. We 
act like grannies at the grocery store, 
prodding fruit and comparing prices, 
getting downright finicky. We demand 
the most for our twenty-nine 
ninety-five 
when 
we 
shop, and do so with an 
intensity 
that 
belies 
Edmundson's image of 
the apathetic yawn-
ing undergrad. 

We understand 
"shopping 
period," a term 
which semantical-
equates pedagogical 
endeavors to wow students with 
99Â¢ specials on Jell-O, is simply too 
alluring to pass up. Anyone_ can see 
that it's an example of how, surprise, 
surprise, a half a century's worth of 
consumer culture has infiltrated the 
ivory tower. The irony, though, is that 
during the next week of classes, we 
will actually give a damn. 

That cleared up, we feel we must 
move on to Edmundson's larger con-
demnation: that we lack genius. Okay, 
we will admit that excitement does 
not equal genius. But we also know 
better (in that apathetic, cool-kid 
way) than to confuse perspiration 
with inspiration. 

Edmundson concludes his essay 
with a short declaration of his plan to 
improve his teaching methods, in an 
effort to combat the consumer-driven 
soft-shelledness of his students: "I'm 
getting back to a more exuberant 
style; I'll be expostulating and arm 
waving straight into the millennium, 
yes I will." Such behavior, we savvy 
shoppers 
know, 
sometimes 
sours 
before its expiration date.
