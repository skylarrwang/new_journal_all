**Title: First to Be Last**

The class of 1999 is the last class of this mil-
lennium. Any member of the junior class of 
1999 knows that. Dean Brodhead (BR '68, 
GRD '72) told us so at our freshman address. 
He said we are "Yale's last chance to get it right." 
I certainly felt proud about that as I moved into 
Old Campus two years ago, Prince's "1999" 
blasting out of every dorm window. Just listen 
to the song, Prince knows what's going on. 
1999 is our last chance to party before the new 
millennium. I presented my father with this 
irrefutable evidence that I was part of this elite 
last class of the twentieth century. Of course, 
my dad rebutted this information. "Count to 
ten," he prodded. I started with one and contin-
ued on, his familiar smirk appearing before I 
reached ten. "See," he pointed out, "you start 
with one and end with ten, so 1991 is the first 
year of this decade and 2000 is the last." 

I was not willing to concede so quickly. My 
dad is a lawyer, and if is my lifelong dream to 
win an argument against him. The Dean ofYale 
College wouldn't lie. Neither would Prince, or 
whatever his name is now. I turned to my trusty 
Webster's Dictionary. I stumbled upon the Table 
of Numbers, which listed the cardinal and ordi-
nal numbers. I could see the proof right there in 
front of me. The cardinal column started with 
zero. Adjacent to it, in the ordinal column, the 
word first; nine lined up perfectly with tenth. 

I was still curious, and when all else fails, I 
head for the Encyclopedia Britannica. But I was 
foiled even there because the encyclopedia's 
explanation only confused me further. 

In Biblical terms, the end of the mil-
lennium will mark the end of the 
world. Does that mean that the 
graduation of the class of 2000 will 
signal the apocalypse? Thankfully, 
I'll have my Yale degree before 
that happens. 

I decided to turn to the 
ultimate authority in time-
keeping: Greenwich, England. 
After all, every day begins right 
there. On the first screen of the web site, bright 
colors announced the unveiling of the world's 
biggest dome in the year 2000. I thought I had 
SEPTEMBER 5, 1997 
finally triumphed, but alas, the scientists over in 
Greenwich pointed out a fatal flaw. There is no 
year 0. We go from 1 B.C. to 1 A.D. So year 1 
is similar to zero on the Table of Numbers. 
Consequently, 1999 is the 999th year of the sec-
ond millennium and 2000 the 1000th. Offi-
cially, 2001 is the first year of the third millenni-
um. Though disheartened, I thought I could at 
least remain secure in the knowledge that I had 
found the answer. But, oh no, even those seem-
ingly trustworthy scientists conceded that, "The 
millennium officially starts on 1 January 2001 
at Greenwich. But most people are regarding 1 
January 2000 as a good day to start the party!" 

Start the party? I guess people will do anything 
to find an excuse to have a good time. So, 
despite all that Dean Brodhead, my father, Web-
ster's Dictionary, and Encyclopedia Britannica 
told me, it turns out Prince was right after all.

**Title: New Haven Transfer**
**Author: Catherine Olender**

The opening days of school are hectic for 
every Yale student, as we flip distractedly 
through blue books and make desperate 
attempts to secure a network connection. 
Carmelo Rivera (DC '00) and Nathaniel Bird-
sall (DC '01) have more challenges ahead of 
them than the standard scheduling, unboxing, 
and rearranging burdens of the average Yalie. 
The roommates are two of the 25 transfer stu-
dents entering Yale this semester. 

I remember the mixture of 
excitement and terror I felt as a 
transfer student in this same 
room one year ago as I attempt-
ed to decipher an overwhelm-
ingly complicated university 
system, most of which was writ-
ten in a language I could hard-
ly understand. Who is this res-
idential college master person? 
Can anybody tell me what classes 
I'm supposed to take, no, shop 
for? Why is there a man shaving 
his head in my bathroom? You 
mean I have to share it with him? Where is my 
freshman counselor?! 

Rivera and Birdsall may enjoy a smoother 
transition than I did, but like me and my trans-
fer classmates of last year, they arrive at Yale sev-
eral years out of high school. Their varied life 
experiences give each student a unique perspec-
tive that combines the naivet√© of the Yale fresh-
man with the assumptions of a veteran college 
student. 

For Rivera, starting at Yale is an unexpected 
homecoming. He grew up on Frank Street in 
New Haven. After graduating from high school 
four years ago, Rivera packed his bags and 
stepped onto a Greyhound bus, vowing never 
to return. Rivera worked at various jobs across 
the country: as a welder in Ohio, on an oil rig in 
Louisiana, and in a Florida power plant. In 
Florida, Rivera decided to go back to school. 
After two successful years at Hillsborough 
Community College in Tampa, Rivera moved 
back to New Haven with plans to study biolo-
gy. "I used to walk construction beams here five 
years ago," he says. "I can't believe I'm back." 

Nathaniel Birdsall's post-high school experi-
ence has been as sedentary as Rivera's has been 
unsettled. Birdsall spent his last two years at 
Deep Springs College near Death Valley, Cali-
fornia, 30 miles from the nearest man-made 
structure. The academically prestigious, two-
year, all-male school has a student body of 26 
and is also a working cattle ranch and alfalfa 
farm. Three transfer students this year come 
from Deep Springs. Most recently, Birdsall 
worked as a dairy boy, milking cows and mak-
ing butter, in addition to studying for his class-
es. One of the hardest things about moving to 
New Haven, Birdsall says, is getting used to 
buying products instead of growing them. "The 
last two years I knew the man who cooked the 
meat, I knew the man who slaughtered the cow, 
I knew the cow's name," Birdsall says. "It's been 
hard to readjust to consumer society." 

In many ways, Rivera and Birdsall are typi-
cal Yale students, however they must endure the 
evolutionary process every Yale freshman 
undergoes without the nourishing primordial 
soup of Old Campus. After their inaugural year 
at Yale is behind them, though, perhaps these 
students will get to play the role of seasoned 
Yalie to a new group of transfer students who 
will arrive on campus next fall.
