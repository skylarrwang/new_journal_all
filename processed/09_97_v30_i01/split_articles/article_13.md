hese could be the vans. The early morning sky is pitch-
black, but with the lighrs from the Honda directed at them, 
we can see two beat-up white vans parked outside a house 
on Fillmore Street in New Haven's Fair Haven neighbor-
hood. No workers are getting in them yet. We circle. 
We're looking for any sign of the migrant farm workers picked up 
by these vans between 4 and 5 a.m. each morning. We drive slowly on 
Lombard Street, heading back toward Fillmore. Just as we reach the 
corner, we notice two men sitting on the stoop of an apartment build-
ing. One of them is short and wears work boors and jeans. The taller 
man has an earring in one ear. We approach them and ask if they are 
waiting for their ride. At first neither man answers. We know that most 
_ of the workers are from Guatemala and Mexico, so we try asking in 
E Spanish. The taller man says he understands English. "No," he replies. 
~ They are not going to work. We wonder if he is afraid to talk to us. We 
~ get back in the car and stay close by. 


At every rum junky vans with dark tinted windows speed by us, 
~ but none stop. Is this the wrong place? It is 4:20 a.m. but even so sever-
~ al people roam the meets. A man seems to be watching us from his 
~ front porch. The two of us are wary of the neighborhood's reputation as 
~ a hang-out for drug dealers. We circle the block one more rime. 


ln our rearview mirror we see a van stop and pick up the two men 
~ at the corner of Lombard and Poplar. We pull close. It has Florida 
S: license plates. As it passes under a sodium-orange streetlight, we can see 
10 
roughly ten people seated in the back. At the entrance to Interstate 91 
on Ferry Street, the van races onto the highway. We speed behind. 
At chis hour, l-91 traffic is predominantly trucks. We give the van 
space in front of us. If these are the migrant workers, they are going 
either to fruit and vegetable farms in North Haven or to tobacco farms 
near Hartford. The North Haven exirs come up quickly but the van 
stays on 1-91. We begin our hour-long drive towards Hartford. 


he migrant farm workers became big news in New Haven this 
summer. This August morning we are seeking out the resi-
dences of the migrant workers on Fillmore Street-near to the 
house closed down by police last week, where more than 30 migrant 
workers and their families slept on bare floors and ditty mattresses. 
Rafael Ramos, a senior neighborhood specialist with New Haven's Liv-
able City Initiative, says that city officials investigated the property afrer 
receiving complaints from neighbors about garbage and noxious odors 
coming from the building. The house had a dangerously unstable 
chimney and stairs, illegal hook-ups to water and electricity, and crash 
was srrewn everywhere. Newspapers also reponed that the house was 
infested with vermin and reeked of raw sewage. Police arrested the land-
lord, 33-year-old Larry Etolue. Since then, the city has closed down 
similar propenies Etolue had renred to the migrant workers on Fillmore 
Street, Cedar Hill Avenue, May Street, Warren Place, and Woolsey 
Street. 


...,.~Â·rv.rtr.:~~~n June and August, hundreds of migrant workers from Mexico and 
Guatemala le9ve their over-crowded New Haven apartments to work 
14-hour days in the tobacco fields of the Connecticut Valley. 
"Because of who these people are and me situation they are in, they 
may not complain," Ramos says. Many of the migrant workers have 
come from Mexico and Guatemala and are in this country illegally 
working on Florida farms during me winter harvest and moving up 
north for me summer. The U.S. Immigration and Naruralization Ser-
vice has arrested 50 suspected illegal aliens at one North Haven farm. 
The Florida license plate on me brown van we are following is a 
clue that we are on me right track. We pass through Hartford, swarm-
ing with big buildings and city lights. Soon me van rums off me high-
way at exit 37 in Windsor. It pulls into a Citgo gas station between me 
highway and a small hill to me west. We stop our car and watch from a 
road at me top of me hill. Within minutes, four other vans arrive. The 
doors of me vans slide open and at least 12 people hop out of each one 
and walk into me convenience Store connected to me station. We fol-
low. Inside me store, about 50 men and women pick out various foods. 
They are dressed like farm workers, wearing earth-tone slacks and work 
boots. A group of men heating soup in a microwave speak to each other 
in Spanish. Thirty people are waiting in line at the checkout counter. 
Some of me women balance soda bottles on their heads. They are buy-
ing burritos, cornbread, and chips. This food will nourish them 
through me 14-some-odd hours of backbreaking work at me Culbro 
tobacco farm in West Suffidd, north of Windsor. Their jobs entail 
picking tobacco leaves, gathering them and putting them into baskets, 
hauling the baskets to trucks, and sewing the leaves together. 
SEPTEMBER 5, 1997 
A young man waiting in line has a University of Auburn cap. His 
clothes are similar to those worn by the rest of me farm workers, but he 
is taller than many of me others. He has a thin mustache and a young 
face. Like almost every other migrant worker we meet, this man speaks 
Spanish. He is sofr-spoken and friendly. He says his name is Lalo, he is 
18 years old, and he comes from Florida. He is driving a car full of 
migrants, including himself, to the Culbro farm. Some of me other 
migrant workers in me store are wearing maroon baseball caps with 
"Culbro" printed in white. Lalo likes the work at Culbro because the 
pay is good, $6.30 per hour. Workers also make time-and-a-half on the 
weekends and after 5:30 p.m., and they get bonuses for increased vol-
ume. This encourages them to work long days. He asks if we are look-
ing for farm work. When he learns that we are Yale srudents who live in 
New Haven, he says mat he has been living in New Haven for the sum-
mer. But he says he does not know which street. 


Lalo and me others hand their food to Joe Cicero, the Citgo man-
ager behind the checkout counter. Cicero, a heavy-set man with a thick 
beard, is enthusiastic to meet us. He says that a couple hundred migrant 
workers come through the Citgo between 5:15 and 6,:15 a.m., seven 
days a week. The 34-year-old manager has always lived in me Windsor 
area. When he was in junior high 20 years ago, he remembers that he 
was one of me only srudents who did not pick tobacco during the sum-
mer. Ar least one farm in the area-Arnold's--still employs srudents. 
Cicero believes mat because of increased concern for children's safety,
