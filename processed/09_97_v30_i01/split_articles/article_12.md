EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Pillows mark seats of those who meditate, while stark walls and large windows provide a sense of tranquility at the New Haven Zen Center. 
began to sit, about four years ago, it was Bruce Blair (TC '81), the 
abbot of the Zen Center, who led meditation sessions. 

The New Haven Zen Center sits at 193 Mansfield Street, tucked 
among Prospect Street, Ingalls Rink, and a number of New 
Haven residences. As I walk toward Mansfield Street on a late 
spring afternoon, I watch the urban drift lazily into the suburban. The 
rumbling traffic two blocks away is a distant buzz. Broken bottles and 
chips of peeled paint liner the sidewalk. Under this film of decay, 
Mansfield Street is an exhausted version of suburbia. 

The Zen Center is a substantial walk up Mansfield Street, and I 
pass by it twice expecting to find a more distinctive building. The cen-
ter's structure mimics that of nearly every other house on the street; its 
new coat of pale blue paint and oval-shaped front window offer it only 
minimal distinction. Looking at the house from a distance, one might 
imagine that it contained anything but a spiritual community center. A 
sign rests inside the front door. It reads, "Welcome. If you are here for 
practice or instructiqn and the door is open, please come in. If the door 
is locked, please ring the bell. Someone will come down to let you in." 
Though I can't believe that anyone leaves their door unlocked in this 
neighborhood, I try twisting the doorknob. It is locked, so I ring the 
bell, feeling a tinge of apprehension at disturbing this house. 
SEPTEMBER 5, 1997 
Someone comes to the door, as the sign promised. He introduces ~ 
himself as Tom Dickinson (SY '78, MUS '83), a practitioner of Zen 5 
who lives at the center. As we walk upstairs through air heavy with ~ 
incense, he invites me to look around. Shoeless, I slip noiselessly ~ 
through a library and into a sitting room that connectS to a kitchen. ~ 
Tom mentions that the center can house up to six people. He leads me ~ 
to the meditation room, which is the largest space in the center. He ~ 
bows so quickly as we enter that I barely notice, but I do the same, for ~ 
fear of exhibiting ignorant disrespect. The room looks the way one ~ 
expects a place called the "dharma room" to look: it boasts hard-wood g 
floors, pictures of past Zen Masters on the white walls, a large bell in ~ 
one corner, and an altar topped with an immense golden buddha -
against the far wall. 

Tom speaks in a whisper in this room, offering information about 
the center. He explains that this center was one of the first three in the 
United States to practice the Kwan Urn School of Zen. On the far wall 
hangs a picture of Korean Zen Master Seung Sahn who started the first 
center of this kind in Providence in 1971. As we complete the tour, 
Tom bids me to rerum whenever I feel the need. He gives me a copy of 
the center's newsletter, Lotus Root. Reading it on the way out, I learn 
that the Zen Center offers free morning and evening meditation, and 
monthly retreats.
