Guardian. "I was very happy in England," 
he said. "I was psychoanalyzed every day." 
In the 1970s, Kramer returned to the U.S. 
and moved to N~ York. In Faggots, 
Kramer depicts the New York gay commu-
nity at the time as a non-stop orgy. The 
point of the novel, though, is that promis-
cuity debases personal relationships, and 
the main character struggles to find a true 
emotional commitment. Today, Kramer, 
who is infected with HIV, says, "If you ask 
most gay men what being gay means, they 
will say it means having sex with another 
man. I'm saying that that's not only what 
gay means. But as long we continue to be 
so blinded, we're going to continue to lcill 
ourselves. We have to create a wider culture 
that doesn't murder us." 


From his secluded house on a lake 
somewhere in Connecticut, Kramer 
laments. "My pristine home in the 
country 
is 
becoming 
a 
warehouse." 
Kramer's lover of four years, David Web-
ster, an architect, is moving things into 
their house. Amidst stacks of boxes, 
Kramer says, with a slight satis-
faction 
under-
neath his annoy- Â· 
ance, 
"It's what 
happens when you get married. 
You'll see." At age 62, 
Kramer is trying to settle 
down and gain the sort of 
social legitimacy he has long 
sought. 
Beyond 
the headaches 
of 
moving, 
Kramer's new domestic 
life pushed his attention 
to other details. "With 
the relationship pretty solid 
now, I decided that it was time to get my 
will in order." The will he drew up would 
have left a certain percentage of his estate 
to his lover and given the rest to Yale. Now, 
unsure of where his money will go, Kramer 
is considering starting an independent 
foundation to support gay and lesbian 
research. 


Kramer's approach to gay rights has 
long been integrationist. He says the inclu-
sion of lesbians and gays in education is 
one of his new concerns, complete with a 
new mantra: "We pay taxes so we should be 
taught in schools the same way everybody 
else is taught." Though his gift has been 
framed as a test of the legitimacy of gay 
studies in academia, Kramer sees it as a test 
of the legitimacy of gays in society in gen-
eral. Kramer, who dismisses the supporters 
of gay studies as "fighting to have sex in the 
bushes and fuck on the subway," has criti-
cized much of the queer theory that has 
been produced by gay studies. "There is a 
disturbing trend in gay studies, and in all 
studies, to teach things so annoyingly irrel-
evant to life as we live it," he says. The sort 
of research he would like to see done is the 
sort John Boswell (Hon. MA '82), the Yale 
history professor who died in 1994, did on 
same-sex unions in the Catholic Church of 
the middle ages. 


Much as gay marriage has been sup-
ported as a way of normalizing gays and 
lesbians, Kramer believes that including 
gays in history and literature would change 
the way they are seen in society. Kramer 
has been writing a book called The Ameri-
can People for the last two decades which, 
when it is finished, will be a fictional 
account of American history highlighting 
the roles of gays. One of the pet the-
ories he has formulated from research 
for the book is that Abraham 
Lincoln had a male lover. 
"Everybody looks at me like 
I'm crazy when I say some-
thing like that," 
says, 
"because it is so 
out of the realm of 
possibility that the best 
president that this coun-
try ever had actually lived with 
another man for 
four years. He slept 
in the same bed 
with a man named Joshua Speed, and they 
exchanged love letters of great passion." 
Kramer recognizes that few, if any, histori-
ans believe his theory, but that is the point. 
"What if he were? Wouldn't it change the 
way this country thought about gay pea-
ple? Wouldn't it change the way gay people 
thought about gay people?" 


Kramer's gift and it's rejection has 
stoked a hot debate. Some are pas-
sionate in their belief that he tried 
to go too far as a donor. Was he trying to 
buy gay studies' way into Yale? Kramer 
says, "Of course academia's not for sale, but 
it sells itself every day of the week." Case in 
point, earlier this year, the heads ofYahoo!, 
the Internet directory service, gave Stan-
ford University $2 million to endow the 
Yahoo! Founders Professor of the Stanford 
School of Engineering. 


At Yale, President Richard Levin (GRD 
'74) says the university attempts to dis-
courage restricted donations. But a signifi-
cant number of endowed positions are 
restricted to a specific field within a larger 
discipline. Levin says the administration 
draws the line when a gift is meant to 
change the direction of the curriculm. 
"The basic principle," Levin says, "is that 
we simply don't let donors determine the 
subjects of study at Yale. That is the job of 
the faculty, and it is, by and large, a job 
very well done." 


But the history of a place like Yale, 
where every building, bench1 tree, and cob-
blestone is named for someone, is very 
much the history of headstrong donors. In 
the Faculty of Arts and Science, which 
includes Yale College and the Graduate 
School, Yale has 167 endowed full profes-
sors which make up about 40 percent of all 
senior faculry positions. The university 
depends on and aggressively solicits the 
financial support of its alumni. Interesting-
ly, Kramer says that it was Yale that 
approached him first about leaving his 
money to the university. Seven or eight 
years ago, someone from the development 
office, which had heard he had a bit of 
money, went to New York to discuss the 
possibility. Kramer said he was only inter-
ested if he could leave the money to "some-
thing gay." The development office gave 
the initial go-ahead on the gift, but noth-
ing came of it until last year. 


Kramer protests that he isn't trying to 
buy into the university, but of course, to 
some degree, he is. He had very personal 
motivations for offering his gift. But in 
that, no doubt, Kramer is not very differ-
ent than all the hundreds and thousands of 
donors whose names now garnish the cam-
pus and the faculty directory.
