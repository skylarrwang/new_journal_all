EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
"And if you haven't 
got honor and pride, 
then nothing 
matters. Only there 
is something in you 
that doesn't care 
about honor and 
pride yet that lives, 
that even walks 
backward for a 
whole year just to 
live; that probably 
even when this is 
over and there is not 
even defeat left, will 
still decline to sit still 
in the sun and die, 
but will be out in the 
woods, moving and 
seeking where just 
will and endurance 
could not move it." 
-William Faulkner, 
Absalom! Absalom!
