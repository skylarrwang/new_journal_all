Perched on a black pillow on the floor of Battell Chapel, my fig-
ure completes a small ring of people. They begin to chant. I flip 
through a book of Zen chants whose frailty implies years of use. 
The words are spoken first in Korean and then in English. For 
ten minutes I stumble through Korean phonetics, relieved only briefly 
by the translation. After chanting, we start a 30-minute sitting medita-
tion. I sit up straighter, centering my shoulders above my hips; some-
one inhales deeply. My legs are already experiencing the dull ache that 
the lotus position often causes. 

I focus my eyes on the grayed carpet beneath me, wondering just 
how I am to empty my mind of thoughts that seem to have nowhere 
else to go. I furtively glance up to check the status of the other practi-
tioners and catch a glimpse of the Biblical scenes formed by stained-
glass panels above my head. This allegedly "non-denominational" 
chapel triggers the onset of my non-secular anxieties. 

I have not attended a religious service in years, and non-meditative 
thoughts begin racing through my head. I think back to ten minutes ear-
lier when I opened the chapel doors and discerned only thick silence. 
Squinting, I detected five figures sitting in the pipe organ's massive shad-
ow. They were so still that they appeared the phantom remains of some 
earlier gathering. As I approached them, my footsteps and even my 
breathing resonated from every crevice of the building. I became guiltily 
conscious of each creak and thud that accompanied me toward them. 

Suddenly, the sharp pain in my back reminds me that I am sup-
posed to be meditating. Recalling my recent sequence of thoughts, I 
determine that the first 15 minutes of this meditation caused me more 
stress than relaxation. Maybe I missed some unspoken but crucial rule 
6 
of "sitting." I wonder if any of my fellow contortionists are suffering. To 
them, I do appear to be meditating, since I sit in the way that Dushko 
Petrovich (DC '97) explained when I first arrived at the chapel: shoe-
less, with feet over knees, back straightened, hands overlapped, shoul-
ders relaxed, tongue "parked" behind the teeth. I now understand why 
he cautioned me not to be discouraged by my first attempt at medita-
tion. "Meditation practice is not special. You don't go in and have this 
special experience. It's not a vacationâ€”you don't go in to relax. As 
many things as you can do to make it a part of your everyday life, the 
better it can engage that everyday life. It's a process that has to work 
itself out," he said. 

Dushko claps two pieces of wood together to mark the end of the 
meditation. My head jerks up and I feel somewhat dazed, though I 
notice that I am not the only one who jumped at the unexpected clack. 
As we gather our belongings and tie our shoes, the people who shared 
this experience speak in low tones. One woman mentions that she 
meditates as part of a religious studies class, a second remarks that she is 
a New Haven resident who practices Zen. I learn that of the six partici-
pants, only three are Yale students. 

The dynamic is similar at the next morning's meditation session. 
Of the seven attendees, four are Yale students and three are New Haven 
residents. I mention this to Dushko and he is not at all surprised by my 
mundane observation. He explains that the meditation sessions are 
open to Yale students as well as those in the surrounding community. A 
community organization, not the university, supports the on-campus 
meditation sessions. He tells me that the New Haven Zen Center is 
responsible for nearly all Zen activities on campus. When Dushko
