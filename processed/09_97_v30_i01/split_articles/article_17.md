EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
For the last year I've been going 
to Tower One-Tower East, a 
home for elderly people, every 
week. Run through a Jewish orga-
nization, the two buildings house 
several hundred independent older 
people. I was paired with one man 
through the "Adopt-a-Grandpar-
ent" program. We talked about 
everything from O.J. Simpson to 
religion to race. Over time I began 
visiting others as well. Mostly I 
just listened to their stories. At 
first the hours of listening bored 
me and all the details seemed like 
heavy ballast. But somewhere dur-
ing the in-betweens I caught 
glimpses of the way a story told 
and filtered and reshaped again 
pulses with a subtle energy. The 
story-tellers stick in my mind: 
Old Mrs. Kifare standing with 
arms outstretched in the rain like 
Christ crucified. Bessie Frye who 
nightly grinds the wheels of her 
rusted exercise bike though her 
eyes can't see well enough to read. 
And Morton Bernard-Cohen, who 
built a war-time canoe out of 
palm bark in the South Pacific and 
spent 40 years chained to a factory 
time-card, just to get copper poi-
soning and lay in a coma for seven 
years. A week after awakening he 
drove out into the countryside 
and began digging a pond. I wish 
I could have captured him there in 
a picture: intent upon some dream, 
for an unknown reason, but still 
to be done.
