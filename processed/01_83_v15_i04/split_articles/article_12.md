The spirit of the spirits shop 
After 15 years, he had become more 
than a familiar face. He was like an 
institution, a piece of the campus' 
furniture. He was known by the proprietors up and down the strip as the 
Mayor of Broadway, the captain of 
the block from Co-op West to Trum-
bull College. Others knew him as 
Dali's Pryde, the streetwise mascot of 
the Quality Wine Shop who liked to 
park himself in the crowded doorway 
~nd stare blankly as people stumbled 
tn. 
But most people knew him as 
Snoopy. 
Snoopy died last month at the ripe 
old age of 105-dog years, that is. 
Over time the registered Pembroke 
Welsh Corgi began to lose his 
eyesight and his hearing, and in 
December he suffered a pinched 
nerve in his spine that left him im-
mobile. Reluctantly, Quality Wine 
Shop owner Elliot Brause had Snoopy 
put to sleep. "It was the hardest thine 
I've ever done in my life," said 
Brause. 
Snoopy was born on May 17, 
196 7. (Ironically, Brause's birthday is 
May 17 as well.) Snoopy came to 
work at Quality Wine for the first 
time 13 years ago. And although 
people occasionally stepped on him 
and tripped over him and tried to 
pick him up in their arms (he didn't 
like to be picked up), Snoopy never 
missed a single workday in all those 
years. He accompanied Brause on 
every liquor and keg delivery he ever 
made. He soon became the center-
piece of the. package store's advertis-
ing strategy, appearing on T -shirts 
and in newspaper advertisements. 
Sometimes Snoopy wore a tutu or a 
Halloween mask or a Santa's hat. In 
one ad, which never ran, Snoopy 
made an appearance as the "quality 
control expert" for the wine shop, 
urinating on a "bad" keg. 
The Mayor of Broadway never 
took a drink in his life, but he saw 
more liquor come and go than any 
drinking man (or woman) would ever 
care to handle. He presided over the 
shop with an air of indifference so 
complete that he sometimes seemed 
anti-social. He respected students as 
long as they didn't touch him, but he 
absolutely would not tolerate other 
dogs on his territory. "He was ex-
tremely possessive of the place," 
remembered Brause, "and quite pro-
tective of the block. This was his 
turf. He never bit or attacked a 
single person, but he just didn't like 
other dogs. He would fight off ten 
dogs at the same time if he had to. 
We had to glue him together a cou-
ple of times, he was so beat up. He 
had patches on his eye and his nose, 
and one time his ear just about fell 
off. But the worst thing that ever 
happened to him was the day he got 
mugged by a cat." 
Snoopy left behind his wife Pep-
permint Patty, a seven-year-old Cor-
gi, but no children. "At least none 
that we know of," said Brause. The 
wine merchant tried unsuccessfully to 
mate the two Corgies over the years. 
But for Snoopy and Patty, it was 
strictly a Platonic relationship. "I 
guess Snoopy just didn't want to ruin 
a good friendship, if you know what 
I mean," explained Brause. 
Peppermint Patty doesn't like the 
life of spirit shop mascot as much as 
Snoopy did, so she stays at home half 
the time. "She's not as attuned to the 
store as Snoopy was," explained 
Brause, "and she's not as streetwise, 
either." But Brause will continue to 
deal in Welsh Corgis, and the Quali-
ty Wine Shop logo will remain the 
same, with the profile of the late 
Snoopy at the center of it all. 
"Snoopy was one of the constants of 
the block, and I guess for some he 
always will be." 


**Backstage at the Rap**
**Author: Jim Lowe**

The Yale Repertory Theatre has 
always been known for its innova-
tion, and this winter it is continuing 
the tradition. Starting this Saturday 
afternoon at 5p.m. the Rep will pre-
sent a series of six seminars on the 
"Birth and Development of the New 
Play" in conjunction with its annual 
Winterfest program of new plays. 

This year, the third for the 
Winterfest program, the Rep is 
presenting three new plays in pro-
gress. Each of these works are still in 
the process of development. The pur-
pose of the Winterfest is to give 
playwrights an opportunity to see 
how their creation appears on a stage 
and how an audience reacts to it. Of 
the three plays, two were written by 
Yale's own: Astapovo br Leon Katz, a 
professor at the Schoo of Drama, and 
Coyote Ugly by Lynn Siefert, a third 
year Drama graduate student. 

According to Rosalind H ienz, 
communications director of the Rep, 
the plays in Winterfest show only 
part of what goes into the writing 
and presentation of a new work. It is 
the rest of the art of creation and 
development that the six seminars 
will try to address. "They will try to 
explain what are the steps between 
the written script and the play on the 
stage, what are the processes that go 
into making a play successful," said 
Heinz. 

The first of the seminars, entitled 
"Blood and Sweat . . . Directing The 
New Play," will feature a panel of 
Hal Prince, the Rep's own Lloyd 
Richards and Gordon Davidson. 
Future seminars will focus on theatre 
critics, casting, contemporary 
playwrighting among other topics. 

"These discussions should be 
fascinating for anyone interested in 
contemporary theatre," said Heinz. 
"But it will not all necessarily be 
pleasant to hear. Some of it may be 
quite disconcerting." 

The Rep urges those interested in 
either the Winterfest plays or in the 
seminars to reserve tickets as far in 
advance as possible, as the availabili-
ty is limited.
