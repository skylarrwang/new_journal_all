EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
In 1972, you could count the number 
of Yale's tenured women professors on 
one hand. There were two. That year, 
Federal regulations compelled Yale to 
use affirmative action guidelines in its 
promotion and hiring of faculty. To-
day, there are 16 women in the senior 
ranks of the Faculty of Arts and Sci-
ences-eight times the number a 
decade ago. But these women repre-sent less than five percent of Yale's 325 
tenured faculty members. In more 
than two thirds of Yale's departments, 
there are no tenured women at all. 
Yale has failed to meet its own pro-
jection that seven percent of the 
tenured faculty would be women. The 
number of women on the junior faculty 
has actually declined since 1976. Yale 
rarely awards tenure; some depart-
ments may not have open positions for 
years. This semester, there is a faculty 
committee to investigate the problem 
of "women and tenure." The commit-
tee, and the Yale Administrators, need 
to take a long, hard look at Yale's 
tenure record, its affirmative action 
policy and its treatment of women 
scholars. 

The first place the committee should 
look is in Yale's own history books. 
Although there's recently been a dra-
matic change in attitudes, Yale's treat-
ment of women scholars was frequent-
ly far from exemplary. Until the 1960s, 
for example, they weren't even allowed 
in Sterling Library's L&B room. Wo-
men have attended the graduate and 
professional schools here since the 
1890s but Yale rarely asked them to 
join the faculty; it wasn't until 1945 
that the Administration permitted a


woman to teach undergraduates. She 
never received tenure. Yale did not 
grant tenure to a woman until 1959. 

The second place to look is Yale's list 
of open tenured positions. It's very 
short. Most departments tell their 
assistant professors that their chances 
for tenure are slim. According to cur-
rent statistics, less than seven of the 70 
women now on the junior faculty can 
expect tenure. Justifiably, Yale points 
with pride to the improvement in the 
overall number of women on the facul-
ty. But, many departments, including 
those without any tenured women, 
face severe economic constraints. In 
the words of Yale's own affirmative ac-
tion officer, "the influx of women just 
started too late." In the next decade, 
Yale will extend relatively few tenure 
offers so it can't see comparable ad-
vances in' the number of women. 

The third place to look is the affir-
mative action office, but the committee 
might have trouble finding it. It's 
located (along with the Women's 
Studies program) in a small cottage 
between a parking lot and the alley 
next to Naples Pizza. There, a staff of 
two ensures that all of Yale's depart-
ments, schools and offices provide 
equal opportunity in the hiring and 
promotion of 6, 700 staff and faculty 
members. 

Fran Holloway, the office's director, 
compiles statistics about Yale's promo-
tion and hiring records. She also 
"monitors" departments' searches for 
faculty members. But she does not help 
recruit women and can only "recom-
mend" after a search that a department 
look again for more women candi-
dates. 

According to Margaret Ferguson, 
associate professor of English, "the of-
fice doesn't seem to apply much pres-
sure except in the ambiguous role of an 
after the fact check." Many other facul-
ty members agree that the office has lit-
tle clout. Historv Professor Donald 
Kagan charges, "It's basically involved 
in paperwork." Until this year, then-
Associate Provost Sherry Penney over-
saw the office and Yale's affirmative ac-
tion policy. But, said one faculty 
member, "the grapevine had it that she 
wasn't particularly forceful." 

Yale's affirmative action office 
shouldn't just be 
a 
"numbers 
cruncher." It needs to be more visible 
in a department's hiring discussions. It 
should also, following the Tobin Com-
mittee's recommendation, help keep 
track of the women in each field. The 
old argument to explain the low num-
ber of tenured women is "there just 
aren't any." Because certain fields have 
relatively few women, the adminis-
trators should insure that all of Yale's 
departments conduct exhaustive 
searches for women candidates. It 
shouldn't look at tenure decisions "after 
the fact"; a token woman on a list of 
candidates doesn't mean that a depart-
ment has fairly considered the women 
in the field. 

But, as the committee probably 
knows, attracting a scholar to a ten-
ured professorship isn't like hiring a file 
clerk or even an assistant professor. 
Strengthening the affirmative action 
office does not entirely solve the prob-
lem. Faculty members' attitudes 
toward tenure slow progress on the 
"women and tenure" problem. 

Departments vigorously defend 
their autonomy in tenure decisions. 
Affirmative action, by requiring Yale 
to "look over the shoulder" of its facul-
ty, is an example of government inter-
ference. One case at the University of 
Georgia demonstrates how intense 
feeling may be: a professor, dressed in 
his academic robes, went to jail for 90 
days rather than reveal his vote in a 
tenure decision. 

The Yale administrators aren't eager 
to step into the tenure review process. 
Provost William Brainard, who is also 
a professor of economics, approves all 
faculty positions and searches. With af-
firmative action, he sees his role as one 
of "moral suasion." "Is it the Ad-
ministration's role to inject its own 
judgment about the qualifications of 
people?" he asked. "The answer is no." 

No one would suggest that admin-


istrators should dictate tenure deci-
sions. But tenure needn't be sacro-
sanct. Yale can interfere with a depart-
ment which has a questionable record 
of promoting women without threaten-
ing its academic freedom. Many facul-
ty members are unsure of the Ad-
ministration's whole-hearted commit-
ment to affirmative action and the ac-
tive recruitment of women. 

The recent cases in the Economics 
Department raise doubts about the ad-
ministration's willingness to put their 
muscle behind their public rhetoric 
about promoting women. Within two 
years two women were denied tenure; 
they were the first women from the 
department who were reviewed for 
tenure. Each had been on the faculty 
for eight years. Sharon Oster taught 
the department's most popular course. 
She is now at Yale's School of Organ-
ization and Management. 
Susan 
Ackerman, along with her husband, 
former Law School Professor Bruce 
Ackerman, left Yale for tenured posi-
tions at Columbia. 
Neither the 
Economics nor the Political Science 
Department has any tenured women. 

It may be coincidental that two 
women in two years didn't receive 
tenure. Neither charges sex discrimin-
ation. For the field, Yale has a relative-
ly high number of women on its junior 
faculty and in its graduate school. Of 
the nation's top 
five 
Economics 
Departments, only MIT has a tenured 
woman professor. 

When Ackerman and Oster were 
turned down, the Economics Depart-
ment had open tenured slots and made 
offers to male professors. Today, there 
are still two unfilled positions. And, 
one member of the department sug-
gests that the Administration could 
have done more to encourage the pro-
motion of women. 

"This was a golden opportunity. 
There was a strong affirmative action 
issue in both the Economics and 
Political Science Departments," Pro-
fessor Richard Nelson said. "The Pro-
vost could have used the opportunity to 
put that forth." 

"The availability of resources was 
not the central issue," Brainard said. 
The Provost's office has money avail-
able specifically to encourage the 
employment of women and minority 
scholars. He asserts that, if the Ad-
ministration had offered money when 
the department had openings, it would 
have been "like making a position with 
someone's name on it." 

Nelson levels another charge against 
the Administration. "The economics 
department was not overwhelmed by 
pressure from the Administration in 
these cases." 

"The administrators went out of 
their way to say there was no 
pressure," the 
department's 
chair, 
Merton J. Peck, said, although he had 
"extensive" conversations with both 
Brainard and Giamatti. 

The Provost defends his role and the 
Administration's procedures. "There 
was more time spent, more careful 
review of these cases than average," he 
said. "The Department acted in good 
faith." 

There's no easy answer to the most 
obvious question: did Ackerman and 
Oster deserve tenure? Members of the 
Department weren't willing to discuss 
the specifics of the decisions. More-
over, there are no absolute criteria for 
granting tenure in any department at 
Yale. 

Many tenure decisions have gen-
erated controversy. But in Oster and 
Ackerman's cases, the dispute centers 
on the administrators' role and how the 
senior faculty perceived Yale's commit-
ment to the promotion of women. 

Another case, in the School of Art, 
raises more questions. The School 
recently awarded tenure to a male pro-
fessor, after the Provost held "exten-
sive" discussions with the School's 
Dean about the need for more women 
faculty. Currently, there are none with 
tenure, although the School has tradi-
tionally attracted many women grad-
uate students. 

According 
to one 
source, several women on the junior 
faculty have recently made complaints 
about unfair treatment.SamiaHalaby, 
who was denied tenure last year, has 
now brought a grievance charging sex 
discrimination. It might be years 
before the department can consider 
junior faculty women for other open-
ings. 

The committee will find that Yale 
isn't alone in its dilemma improving 
the low number of tenured women. 
Women hold less than five percent of 
the tenured positions at many Ivy 
League universities. Yale may be dif-
ferent because it hasn't yet received 
public attention about a sex discrim-
ination in tenure case. Last year, for 
example, Harvard attracted national 
publicity when a grievance committee 
supported sociologist Theda Skocpol's 
charge that sex discrimination affected 
her tenure decision. 

Skocpol, who now has a tenured 
position at the University of Chicago, 
argues that schools like Harvard and 
Yale are less receptive to changing 
their traditions in order to provide 
more opportunities for women. 

"Although Chicago is no feminist 
place," she remarked, "women hold 
nine percent of its senior faculty posi-
tions." Ivy League institutions, by con-
trast, don't want to abandon the "old 
boy" hiring network and ingrained at-
titudes about tenure and women, she 
says. 

Skocpol may be right. At Yale, 
many doors (not just those in the L&B 
room) have begun opening for women. 
But its tradition makes it less receptive 
to change. There's an affirmative ac-
tion office but, in the view of many of 
Yale's own faculty, it has little clout or 
influence on tenure decisions. There 
are administrators who are personally 
committed to the advancement of 
women but who are not willing to use 
their offices' power to back their com-
mitment. And there's a senior faculty 
which, 
despite many individuals 
dedicated to equal opportunity, still 
has only 16 women- not enough to 
form a "critical mass" or "old girl" hir-
ing network of their own to promote 
women candidates in tenure searches. 

And now there's a committee which 
has the potential to be much more than 
a rubber stamp on Yale's affirmative 
action and tenure policies. It has the 
power to investigate all aspects of the 
"women and tenure" problem. It's 
charge is to answer the question, "why 
aren't there more women on Yale's 
senior faculty?" In the process, it can 
raise difficult issues and perhaps pro-
vide solutions for the second decade of 
women and affirmative action at Yale.
