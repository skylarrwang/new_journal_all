of the latest Guide. For the remaining 
colleges, the guide staff resorted to 
phone intervi~ws. 

How accurate is the staff? The old 
record here is blemished: in the book's 
fifth edition , someone mixed up the 
University of the South with Southern 
University in Baton Rouge. As a re· 
suit, the book falsely claimed that two 
black students at the University of the 
South had been killed during a demon-
stration. The ensuing lawsuit was set-
tled out of court in 1976 when Berkley 
Publishing Company (then the guide's 
publisher) paid $10,000 to the Uni-
versity of the South. Since the fifth 
edition mixup, however, the guide has 
grown in size and seriousness. Ithaca 
College, 
described in the seventh 
edition as a party school with an active 
pickup scene, did sue the guide for 
defamation, but the guide won handily. 
Recent editions (including the last) have 
been edited with care to avoid libel. The 
book is factually quite correct. 

The question of bias, however, has 
remained troublesome. In all of the 
first eight editions, the guide's writers 
have lectured against Harvard. They 
grant the school's prestige, only to 
dismiss it as a social wringer, a magnet 
for snobs and bad teachers. The 
1981-82 guide, for example, claims, 
"The problem with all students here is 
that they are taught to think, talk, and 
act in a certain way: obnoxious, su-
perior, and self-confident. So they do." 

And then there's the guide's loyalty to 
Yale. In the 1981-82 edition, the Yale 
chapter, by far the longest in the book, 
reads like an admissions catalogue. No 
statement in the chapter is actually un-
true; but none is critical. While such 
prejudice may be natural, it casts a 
shadow over the credibility of the en-
tire book. 

Now that shadow has been lifted. In 
the latest guide, the Yale chapter is a 
model of modesty. 
Although the 
authors find much to praise at their 
school, they refrain from actually 
gloating and offer some mild criticisms 
about expense and town-gown rela-
tions. The Harvard article is also 
balanced, even generous. Reading 
some chapters, it's hard to believe that 
Yalies wrote this book. Where is their 
traditional scorn towards small-town 
conservative schools? The latest

writers even make a show of charity 
towards Christian fundamental and 
Catholic schools. For example, "As the 
administration puts it, Bonaventure 
strives to 'foster a community of friend-
ship, 
brotherhood, 
and 
mutual 
service.' Isn't that what a liberal educa-
tion is ultimately about?" No, but that's 
a generous way of putting things. Tol-
erance of other cultures, indeed, in-
forms 
the entire guide. 
It finds 
redeeming features at colleges the 
average Yalie would snicker at. 

But don't worry about being white-
washed. The guide remains critical, 
and sharp. It finds the University of 
Maryland "truly remarkable in having 
so much in the classroom that is so 
bad." A student at Sweet Briar con-
siders her classmates "as diverse a 
group of debutantes as I've seen." On a 
grimmer note, the book charges that 
several schools, including Trinity Col-
lege at Hartford and the University of 
Virginia, have racist atmospheres or 
fraternities. Such charges, Reid said, 
were carefully verified. 

No book is perfect. Personally, I · 
wish the authors had surveyed more 
students in the beginning. I have 
sc:veral quibbles with the College 
Fmder. (Why wasn't Stanford listed 
under "strong in math or science"? 
Why didn't Wheaton make the list of 
women's colleges?) And of course a 
personal visit to the college should 
weigh far more in the senior's mind 
than any guide . .But for a fun starting 
point, the latest Insider's Guide can't be 
beat. It's informative. It's objective. 
And for the terrified, about-to-be-
j~dged high school senior, it offers a 
n.ce sprinkling of zaniness: "Above all, 
what makes going to school at UCSD 
ltJ:te University of California at San 
D1ego) exciting is that the San Andreas 
Fault is close by ... " 

I hope that future editions of the 
guide will retain a sense of humor. Our 
high school senior, sweating over his 
no-doze and thesaurus, needs it .
