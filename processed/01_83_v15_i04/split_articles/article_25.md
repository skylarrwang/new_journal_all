A contest of smells 
At about 7:00 the basement is a contest 
of smells. Evt>ry room is filled with 
something different. 
Mushrooms. 
Radishes. Cheddar cheese. Green pep-
pers. Iceberg lettuce. There arc crates 
of tomatoes and broccoli and cabbage 
piled by the elevator. "I can smell 
something cooking in the kitchen 
before I can smell what the bake shop's 
working on," says Larry Freeman, a 
baker. But inevitably onions win. The 
vcgatable shop across the hall from the 
bake shop fills the whole complex with 
the sharp smell of onions. "Don't even 
mention them," says one of the 
workers, disgusted. 
"If one-of the women who has been 
working on them comes in to the main 
office I can ltll," says Rose Proto, a 
secretary at Commons. "Myself, I 
can't even go into the room when the 
onions arc being p(·clecl, I cry c;o 
much." 

Eva Pennicooke, a 50-vear-olcl pan-
try worker, has peeled onions for three 
years because nobody dst• wants to. 
It's painful and tedious, and, yes. it 
makes you cry. "After 15 or 20 min-
utes a film of sulfuric acid coats your 
face," she explains. "You stop sniffing 
and crying, but you can't wash your 
face or it starts all over again. Your 
have to build up the layer of acid. And 
standing in the r<.'frigcrator helps 
some, too." 
She hums and says none of the work 
bothers her right now because" she go-
ing to Jamaica for a few weeks to visit 
her husband. "Somcbody's got to do 
this job." she rationalizes. "Tiw only 
thing is 
how embarrassed 
I get 
sometimes, about the smt>ll. It is so, so 
terrible. l'U walk into a public place, 
Compressed air Jets help Ere Penecoolce peel onions. 
and people will turn to look at me and 
stare." Still, the job looks miserable. 
She stands behind a plastic "sneeze 
guard" which hangs over the pilt> of 
onions to keep the peels from flying in-
to ht>r face. Using a high prt>ssure air 
hose, Pennicooke holds the onion and 
strips away the outer layer of brown 
skin. She then tosses the naked bulb 
into a hamper behind her. Doing this 
for two and a half hours, she can peel 
645 pounds. That's more onions than 
most people will touch in a lifctinw. 

As recently as a year ago, then: wen:

was a waste of time. Now Commons 
receives shredded lettuce from a ven-

buyer. "Last year I ended up sending

back about 1000 pounds a week be-
cause it was so discolored." Mitchell, 
who grocery shops for the University 
starting at 7am every morning at the 
Long Wharf wholesale food terminal 
purchases practically every morsel of 
food-from produce and meat to sugar 
and salt - that winds up on your plate. 
The room looks like a manufactur-
ing plant. The machines that line the 
walls are strategically placed so that 
the preparation process can move 
directly from one operation to the 
ne~t. There is a vegetable washer, 
wh1ch looks like a stainless steel casket; 
a spin dryer which uses centrifugal 
force to drain away the water and a 
vacuum packer which sucks air out of 
the packing bags. 

Every now and them a pantry 
worker gets careless with the vegetable 
washer, and ends up wet. "It only 
seems to happen when you're in a bad 
~ood , when you least expect it. That's 
hfe," says Catherine Ritter, a pantry 
worker. She has just changed her 
clothes after pressing the wrong button 
an.d gettin$ drenched. "The worst 
t~mg is that it doesn't stop automa-
tically You have to go back under the 
stream of water to turn it off. Double 
Wet," she chuckles. 

Except for the onions and heavy 
boxes, working in the vegetable shop 
seems pleasant. "It's the meat I can't 
stand," says Pennicooke. In the next 
room, meat hangs thawing for use in 
the kitchen. The blood drains onto the 
floor as the meat warms. "Smells up 
the place. It's disgusting," she says. 
88,000 chickens 
One place no official Yale tour will 
take you is the Long Wharf Terminal. 
It's on the far side of route 34, the last 
stretch along a row of local produce 
vendors where Yale University Dining 
H all receives produce and meat every 
day of the week. The amounts the pro-
cess each year would stagger the 
average canrnovr - 88,000 chickens, 
38,900 burgers, 44,000 pounds of 
pork and 8, 700 foot-long dogs. 

The Butcher Shop at Long Wharf 
T erminal doesn't smell at all. In fact it 
seems extraordinarily sterile. Every-
one walks around in clinical white 
coats, hard hats and steelplated boots. 
T hey all carry clipboards. The butcher 
shop used to be located under com-
mons with all the other operations, but 
in the last 15 years the process has 
been streamlined. The funny thing is 
that you see very little meat. It's all in 
containers bv the walls, or in card-
board crates on the ,,hite formica 
tabletops. It's a far cry from Sinclair 
Lewis' meatpacking horror. The meat 
hangs form cast-iron hooks only after a 
shipment arrives, but the butchers
