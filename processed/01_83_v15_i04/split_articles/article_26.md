quickly move the slabs along the ceil-
ing track and into the refrigeration 
room. Ther supervisors sit in a glass 
observation booth, marking up orders 
and checking supplies under the fluor-
escent light. Occasionally, one of them 
glances up to survey production. 
"They're behind closed doors, if you 
know what I 
mean," says Gene 
Lacobelli, the husky middle-aged but-
cher who's been in charge of cutting 
every piece of meat Yale has consumed 
for the last 17 years. The supervisors 
don't touch the meat. They don't work 
with the butchers, or take their breaks 
with them. As in any bureacracy, the 
supervisors, manager and expeditors 
worry about looking good. 

Every slab of beef and mutton and 
pork that comes into the Long Wharf 
terminal arrives in vacuum-sealed 
packages form Iowa Beef Processors, 
the biggest meat processor in the 
world. The new packaging (called 
Cryovac) saves time and freight costs 
for the butchers and increases shelf-life 
of the beef, but it reduces the butcher's 
job to what Lacobelli calls "portion 
control." 

Portion control is a butcher's curse. 
It is the tedium of watching over a 
automatic pattie machine as it drops 
5000 uniform, flat, five-ounce ham-
burger patties onto thin pieces of wax 
paper. "There are things in every job 
that get boring. For us, it's doing the 
same cuts of meat, "says Lacobelli. 
Although these machines can be 
tedious, they can also be dangerous if 
you're not careful. The band saw that 
Lacobelli uses to clip chicken pieces 
and to form pork chops can cut 
through frozen meats like jello. A few
years ago one of the butchers lost a 
finger. And there are other hazards in 
the meatshop. The butchers are re-
quired to wear hardhats to protect 
themselves from the "ponderous" cuts 
of frozen meat which hang pcrcarious-
ly from the hooks. To protect their 
feet, they wear steel-plated boots. 

Naturally, Lacobelli says, sanitation 
is as important as cutting the meat. 
The butchers stop production everyday 
at 3:00 and start cleaning. It takes the 
rest of the afternoon to hose down each 
machine, inside and out, to scrub the 
walls, to bleach the counrter tops and 
cement floors and to squeegee it all 
dry. "W e use as much water as any-
thing else," says production manager 
Maryann Bernick. After all, she says," 
the FDA inspects every day. The place 
has to be spotless. 

No one is supposed to know exactly 
when Jim Hill, the FDA inspector, will 
arrive to sample and stamp the meat. 
"H e's got the power to shut down the 
place," says 
Bernick. 
"If there's 
something dirty or unsafe, he can halt 
production. But he doesn't do that 
often. H e make suggestions in his 
report, and points out things to us." So 
the tables and walls sparkle. 

The butchers say the only unplea-
sam thing about working at the shop is 
the cold. The cutting room is kept at a 
cool and humid 55 degrees. You can 
see your breath. "When you're stand-
ing using the knives for a few hours on 
frozen meat, 
you 
begin 
to 
feel 
it- hands first, toes next," says one 
cutter. So when the butchers take their 
ten minute break at 10:00am they 
head upstairs to the main office for 
warmth and coffee. 

An anonymous bond
It comes together on the serving line-
meat, vegetables and bread. Three 
separate operations end up on a single 
plate. And although more than a thou-
sand people probably worked to put it 
there, in all jobs at all hours, you prob-
ably don't know a single one of them. 
You don't know their names. You 
don't know their faces. It's a strange, 
anonymous bond for people who are, 
in a way, so intimately connected from 
day to day.
