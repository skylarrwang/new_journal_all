Comment 
When 
Falwell came 
to Yale
W. Hampton Sides
It was a lost war for so many who 
turned out, a missed opportunity to 
destroy somebody disagreeable. For 
others it was only confirmation that a 
smart politician knows how to juggle 
his views for a hostile audience. But 
that night I sensed that there was more 
to the crowd's reaction than this. I was 
fairly certain, as I walked out into the 
wet streets after hearing him, that 
something had gone awry. Some well-
learned confidence had failed, some 
stale college-boy ideal had played out. 
And when I saw the other faces it oc-
curred to me that I wasn't the only one 
who felt it. I could see it in their ex-
pressions, could hear it in the flat 
silence of the lecture hall as it emptied. 
Jerry Falwell had walked into a lion's 
den that night, and left with an ap-
plause. And no one could understand. 
. Maybe it was just bad vibes linger-
mg from Giamatti's freshman address 
about the New Right last year, but 
there 
was something incongruous 
about Falwell's very presence here on 
November 11, 1982. After all, this was 
the "peddler" of coercion the president 
had warned everybody about. This was 
the glaring, smiling symbol of all the 
crude Middle American values that 
universities are supposed to renounce 
a!ld . work against. So from the be-
~nnmg there was the frown of an 
tnstitution. 

The evangelist from 
Virginia had been invited, but he 
wasn't exactly welcome. Was this why 
P.resident Giamatti agreed to meet in 
hts office with Falwell earlier in the 
day, but was infuriated when a New 
York Times photographer snapped off 
a few shots of the two men shaking 
hands in Woodbridge Hall? What 
would the alumni say about this in the 
paper? 

But reflecting upon the evening I 
spent with Jerry Falwell, I think that 
there was nothing I could call "crude" 
about the man. I remember only the 
smoothness of his style, the frankness 
of his appearance, the gray three-
piece. This was no redneck monster 
no fire and brimstone bumpkin i~ 
polyester. This was a politician with 
sp7echwriters and a carefully sculpted 
hatrcut. We had expected the Bible 
and got politics instead, had expected 
hallelujahs and got figures and 
statistics and a few boring quotes out 
of Reader's Digest instead. 

What was worse, we had expected 
stupidity and provincialism, and 
wound up with a 
rather brilliant 
speaker who knew where he was that 
night. 

The conversation began delicately at 
the pre-speech dinner for Falwell and 
his entourage. They were serving bak-
ed chicken in the T.D. fellow's lounge 
when University Chaplain John Van-
norsdall called for a moment of "op-
tional" prayer. It was to be non-sec-
tarian prayer of course, a minute or 
two for people so persuaded to bless 
their food. I glanced up to see Falwell's 
reaction. He was grinning at his asso-
ciates as he bowed his head. 
Optional, 
non-sectarian 
prayer. 
Wasn't this exactly what he wanted to 
see back in the public schools? Falwell 
kept grinning. 

There were just a handful of us at 
the table with Falwell- a few reporters 
and P.U. members in coat and tie. We 
were eating quietly, craning our necks 
to see, as Chaplain Vannorsdall tried 
to break the ice. The first topic that 
cropped up between the two men of the 
cloth was nuclear war. Falwell pointed 
out that his biggest concern was not the 
Russian threat, but rather the spread 
of nuclear weapons 
into under-
developed countries. And then, out of 
nowhere, Chaplain Vannorsdall 
started quoting from T homas Hobbes' 
Leviathan, which he had been looking at 
that day. Vannorsdall said the atom 
was like the Leviathan, filling mankind 
with fear and compelling us to obe-
dience through its awesome power of 
destruction. 

Okay, I thought. It seemed natural 
enough to me in the setting, this casual 
sort of scholarly namedropping. Then 
it struck me that Falwell probably 
hadn't read a whole lot of Hobbes in 
his lifetime and that he probably didn't 
care to hear about him now while he 
was picking apart his chicken wing 
across the table from us. What does 
J erry Falwell have to do with Thomas 
Hobbes?, I thought. 

Sometimes books are the handiest 
way to sidestep direct conversation. 
Sometimes people need an old frame 
of reference for explaining something 
entirely new, just as someone might 
refer to a verse from the Bible when he 
doesn't have the answer. But when 
liberals like Vannorsdall show such 
predilection for books in times of 
uneasy conversation, 
I 
begin to 
wonder whether there might be 
something to all this business about 
"secular humanism." Maybe it is more 
than a code word in the Bible Belt, 
more than the philosophy of Satan at 
work. Maybe it in fact exists as a kind 
of high faith, and maybe many of us 
depend on it for answers. 

Outside the building while Falwell 
spoke, a modest-sized gathering of 
students staged a protest play they 
called a "secular humanist vigil." They 
chanted lines by candlelight, 
condemning bigotry and chauvinism 
and oppression and nuclear war. They 
praised the liberties of reproductive 
right and 
sexual alternative. 
In 
unison, 
they read from 
a 
script 
reverently prepared by the organizers, 
drowning out the roars from the lion's 
den with a methodical hum. They 
never entered the building. People 
who went to the vigil said they felt bet-
ter when it was over. The question oc-


curs to me: isn't this religion, and 
who's to say it isn't? 

It was this same humanitarian faith 
that told me that many of Falwell's 
beliefs were morally wrong. And 
because of this, I assumed that he was 
wrong in a constitutional context, that 
his opinions were illegitimate, and I 
dismissed him as an ignoramus. I then 
made the even greater mistake of as-
suming that his illegitimacy was self-
evident to the planet, because I 
thought I had seen a bit of the light 
and he hadn't, because my words were 
softer, more elusive than his. I had 
pretended all along that the pile of 
books on the shelf back in the room 
somehow made me more intelligent 
than he, and therefore more right. I 
didn't have to think things through. I 
had read my H obbes, and he hadn't. 

When Jerry Falwell came to Yale I 
think many people discovered that 
faith alone wasn't .good enough in a 
political debate. They found they 
couldn't 
rely 
on the babble of 
humanism to answer the radicals of the 
right or left. 

Pluralism. Tolerance. Civilization. 
Humanity. We all know the buzz-
words. They sre the poignant catch-
phrases ingrained in our minds by our 
poets, people like Giamatti and Van-
norsdall and Coffin. The words sound 
pretty, and they fall out of the mouth 
like baby food. We use the words in 
conversation just as the evangelicals 
argue social issues out of the Good 
Book. But what does "tolerance" stand 
for when a Falwell comes and con-
demns pornography? What does "plur-
alism" mean when a Falwall comes and 

says abortion is murder? The words 
are irrelevant, because they exist as ar-
ticles of faith and not as arguments of 
politics. 

Falwell believes child 
por-
nography is immoral, believes abortion 
is murder. This is not a matter of 
sophistication, just conviction. This is 
how a minister from southern Virginia 
can come and speak before a throng of 
presumably bright and politically-
minded studen ts, and confound them 
all. It's religion getting in the way of 

But in the end, that's all we really 
have to go on, isn't it? Faith, feeling, 
religion, whatever we choose to call it. 
And 
it 
ultimately doesn't 
matter 
whether that faith comes from Soc-
rates, J esus C hrist or Russell Baker. 
Yet we shouldn't let convictions mas-
querade as -political arguments and 
assume that others who don't catch on 
are morally wrong. We shouldn't dis-
claim the· sincerity or plausibility of so-
meone else's ideology, or else we fall 
into the same blind trap, the same self-
righteousness, that I think the Moral 
Majority falls into. 

Many people within the liberally 
educated elite try to make the evangel-
icals understand that they must keep 
politics and religion separate. They 
think there is something unsophisti-
cated, something unconstitutional 
even, about a lawmaker allowing his 
private morality to influence 
his 
political stance. Legislating morality, 
they call it. But they think nothing 
when they color their politics with their 
own brand of faith, a faith that is every 
bit as sacred to them as the Word is to 
a Baptist pastor. Like some set funda-
mentalist, they fail to perceive their 
mora.lity as a morality in a philo-
sophical sense, as some debatable way 
of looking at the world. 

The confusion and hypocrisy which 
result when these people presume that 
politics should be amoral is nowhere 
more evident than in the rhetorical 
gymnastics of President G iamatti. The 
president of Yale has thought it ap-
propriate on occasion to use the Yale 
podium for making veiled statements 
about public prayer and abortion, for 
example, but has implied that people 
like Falwell, because they are religious 
men, should not involve themselves in 
the political process. The president of 
Yale has issued a statement pledging 
financial assistance to draft resisters, 
but has not permitted a Yale singing 
grou p to broadcast the Solidarity an-
them over Voice of America because it 
would constitute a political act. I don't 
get it. 

But then there are a lot of things I 
still don't understand about all of this. 
The confusion I felt as I walked out in-
to the rainy night a fter the Falwell 
episode remains for me largely that-
confusion. I remember holding in my 
hand a book of matches that Cal 
Thomas, the vice-president of M oral 
Majority, Inc., had been passing out 
to the crowd. "Moral Majority Book 
Burning Matches," it said, with the 
organization's logo emblazoned in red, 
white and blue. "See o fficial book list 
inside." Curious, I flipped open the 
matchbook and there was only a blank 
list with numerals where the indexed 
books should have been and a dozen 
pieces of bald cardboard instead of 
matches. "That's right ... there 
aren't any!!!" it -said, and I could only 
laugh, because the truth was that Yale 
was the only thing that was burned 
that night.
