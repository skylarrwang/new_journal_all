At any hour 
of the day or night, 
you can be sure 
that someone, 
somewhere, is working 
on our next meal.

Mansi and his team of bakers arc 
} only a few of the hundreds of behind-
iS the-scenes workers in Yale's immense 
:: food network. Yale University Dining 
~ Hall Services runs 26 dining hall units, 
two hospital food services, and an 
elderly nutrition program on a healthy 
budget of !14 million. Complete with 
vending machines, a fleet of 
and a meats division in the Long 
WharfTerminal, Yale's food empire is 
the largest in southern Connecticut. At 
any hour of the day or night, you can 
be sure that someone, somewhere, is 
working on your next meal. 

In the basement of Commons where 
Mansi works you will find the real 
nucleus of Yale's food operations- the 
machines which clean and shred and 
skin the fruits and vegetables; the 
ovens that bake the breads and cook-
ies: the industrial artists who frost and 
ice the cakes and brownies that make 
rheir way into every dining hall on the 
.unpus. 

Few 
people 
realize that 
1-c-~hman Commons sits on top of a 
\ irtual food factory- the bake shop, a 
vegetable shop. and a king-sized kit-
cht·n. Tlw lan~e quantities of supplies 
n·quirc full-time workers to keep 
rhings well-stocked. And supplies are 
constantly 
being delivered 
and 
shipped-as much as 14,000 pounds of 
flour and 11 ,000 pounds of sugar come 
throu~h the loading dock each year. So 
~~hether it's the night of a sports ban-
quet. the freshman Christmas dinner, 
or a typical meal. the basement is in 
constant motion. 

"Things go well because we're all 
pretty good friends down here," ex-
plains assistant manager Mark Girard .

another.~ Girard should know. As co-
ordinator and arbitrator for the dif-

**Title: A night with the bakers**
**Page number(s): 32-33**

On the average day the three Com-
mons bakers meet behind the Person-
nel Office on Ashmun Street and walk 
to work. The men stick together 
because they say the streets are not 
safe. "There arc a lot of crazies out 
there, you know," says Bob Knox, a 
University baker for 13 years. "Com-
ing to work one time, we saw a man 
hanging from the cemctary wall by one 
leg. He didn't even know where he 
was. Somebody gave him LSD at a 
party." The bakers took him down. 

Another 
morning 
the bakers 
discovered some students climbing on 
the scaffolding outside Woolsey, and 
tramping on the roof. The workers 
called the Yale police. "We didn't want 
anyone hurt," says Knox. And just 
recently the bakers said they accident-
ally interrupted a couple on the street. 
"What did' we see? What didn't we see, 
if you know what I mean. And two 
people of the same sex." 

It's not unusual for poeple to wander 
into the basement of Commons late at 
night following the scent of fresh 
bread. "Students come in from time to 
time, so J give !h(·m a few cookies, 
sure. We aim to please," says Mansi. 

After desc<·nding inw che basement, 
the first thing Mansi docs after turning 
on the lights, is to start the oven. The 
task is not as easy as it sounds because 
the gas pilot light is touchy. An air-
raid alarms sounds when the pilot goes 
:>lit. "It rings through the basement, 
LOUD," says Girard. "The manufac-
turer tOok it apart completely over 
Thanksgiving break. The problem is 
that we push the oven, over-use it." 

But that's hard to imagine. The stain-
less steel monstrosity is at least 15 by 
15 feet and looks like it could heat 
Rhode Island. Five or six 
could fit inside. 

At 3:15am the bakers begin the long 
process of making bread. 
They 
concentrate on the dough, testing and 
tasting. It becomes impossible for the 
bakers to hear each other talk over the 
AM radio, the two mixing machines, 
and the hum of the oven. Hand signals 
and shouts become their means of 
communicalion. And the small win-
dow fan doesn't stop the droplets of 
perspiration from forming on their

foreheads, telling them that the oven is 
ready. 

Pony-sized cockroaches 

The bakers don't need recipes. h's sec-
ond nature by now. Each of tht•m has 
worked the 3-11 shift for fiv<' years. 
Their motions are pretise and prac-
tised. Knox whistles as he dribbks it·· 
ing over the danish. "I gel up pretty 
early. I usually get up at I 2:30 10 gel 
ready for work," he says. "I have to gel 
situated, you know. I'm not one of 
those people that an get up and go at it 
straight away." 

Kneading the bread requin·s the 
most work. It lies on tlw tahk, a 
doughey amoeba as big as a man. 
Potential penuche bars. 

Mansi rips into it with a long knife, 
separating it like Silly Putty. Tht·y roll 
the pieces into balls and slather them 
with e~g batter to make the crust shiny 
and hard. 

There are cockroaches. "You should 
sec some of them," says Mansi. "Pony-
sized. But it's the same at every 
bakery, anywhere there's food. They 
try everything to get rid of them. We 
keep chis place as clean as possible, but 
so many people come thrugh here, and 
bake in this small area that there's 
bound to be a mess. There's no time to 
keep everything spotless. Wc'n• busy 
the whole time. The only chance there 
is to clean is when the students come in

at night." White powder and splotches 
of dough lie everywhere. 

"Anyway, I think we do a ({Oodjob," 
says Mansi. "We give the kids home-
style and nearly 400 dincrcnt baked 
~oods. It's as good as any commercial 
bakery." 

Of course students always like to 
mmplain about the food, but the 
bakers have a theory about such peo-
plt· ... It's tough to say why JX'Ople like 
some things," says Mansi . "You ({CI 
pros and cons on everything. It can 
JUst be the person's tastes, too. Some 
people's tastes are off, vou kno.,v. 
Maybe they're unhappy or o;omething 
•?at day, and certain things don't seem 
rt~tht. But it's not the food it's them." 

Once Mansi set out to prove the 
taste theory. In an experiment, he 
({ave his boss a piece of cake to sample. 
"He hated it. but I knew there was 
nothing wrong with the cake. So I 
saved it, that very same cake. And ten 
days later I gave the s:tme persn 
another pie<:e. He loved it, so help me 
God. It just I{OC'I to sho"" that tastes are 
hard to trust." 

Just before 6:00 Mansi brings out 
three white papers hats like the one-. 
tht·y wear at McDonald's. Reluctantly, 
everyone puts one on. "It's the one part 
of the uniform I hate. But we are sup-
posed to wear them. So just before the 
manager arrive<; ...
