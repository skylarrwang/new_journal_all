The Insider's Guide to the Colleges: The Yale Dally News at Its best 
Pity the high school senior. As you 
relax over winter vacation, he faces a 
swamp of college catalogues, essays, 
and deadlines. He must answer ques-
tions. like, "what extracurricular activity 
have you found most meaningful, and 
why?" In all likelihood, the schools he 
visited last summer have melted into a 
single image of lawns and brick build-
ings. The statistics tell him little about 
actual college life. He has no idea 
where he wants to go to college. 

The Yale Daily News Insider's Guide to 
the Colleges was written for this student. 
Unlike conventional college guides 
such as Barrons and The College Board 
Handbook, the Insitkr's Guide emphasizes 
the Great Intangibles of college living 
-suntan potential, party scene, the 
typical personality. The latest edition, 
scheduled to hit the bookshelves by the 
end of the month also lists 41 types of 
schools in a College Finder: prestig-
ious, strong party traditions, strong in 
social sciences, etc. The resulting 
dossier of student folklore aims to tell 
the high school senior "what the col-
leges are really like." 

The insider's angle sells. When the 
staff of the Yale Daily News first pro-
duced a college guide in 1969 (publ. 
1970), they saw it as little more than a 
fun way to make a few thousand dol-
lars. Eight editions later, the book has 
become a small institution. Its success 
has inspired similar guides, most 
notably the New York Times Selective 
Guide to the Colleges. But no one book 
has earned absolute credibility. 

Controversy over the Selective Guide's 
rating system prompted the New York 
Times to pull its name from the guide's 
title. And questions remain concerning 
the validity of the Insider's angle. 

First, who are the insiders? Most are 
college newspaper editors. The Guide 
staff sends each campus paper the last 
guide article on its college and asks the 
editor to update it and find someone 
else to write an additional article. For 
the latest edition, the staff also ar-
ranged for Yalies to send similar mail-
ings to their friends. Students from 
well over 7 5 percent of the colleges sent 
back some sort of written information, 
according to Jasper Reid ('82), editor
