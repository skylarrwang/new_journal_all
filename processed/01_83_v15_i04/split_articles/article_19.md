there. And Renee Hartman. And 
Leon Weinberg,. William Rosenberg, 
Menachem Stern. But so were many 
Yale students, and to them especially 
Mr. Wiesel spoke. 


He had been teaching a special 
course at Yale that semester on 
"Literature and Memory." The 
syllabus began with Jeremiah and en· 
ded with Solzhenitsyn, covering in 
betweeen the writings of other 
chroniclers. 


Elie Wiesel is a gaunt man with sad 
eyes, and weary cheeks, and a soft, 
haunting voice. T hat night, he chose to 
speak sitting down. 


"Tonight, I think what I would like 
to do is really to study with you," Mr. 
Wiesel said. "We'll study one episode 
about one man about whom almost 
nothing is known." Simon Dubnov, 
author of an important history of world 
Jewry, chronicled until his dying hour 
the atrocities committed in Riga, Lat· 
via. While soldiers executed J ews by 
the hundreds in the woods outside the 
city, and tanks stormed synagogues 
under siege, Mr. Dubnov sat writing a 
document that has never been found. 
One of his former pupils at the Univer-
sity of Heidelberg became an SS officer 
and taunted his former professor. 


"Once he sneered at him and said, 
'Dub nov, yesterday I happened to be 
in the Black Forest. Four hundred and 
eighty prisoners shot and at least as 
many Jews. You can rejoice Dubnov! 
You have already attained equality 
with the Russians.' 'How many Jews 
were executed?' Dubnov asked, '480? 
T hank you for the information. You 
see I'm still working and it is important 
for me to know.'" 


This same SS officer, Mr. Wiesel 
said, 
shot Simon Dubnov on 
December 8 , 1941. 


"And here comes a shocking dis-
covery. As a teacher in this school, I 
can't tell you how this discovery af-
fected me. When suddenly we discov-
ered that most of the killers of the four 
Einsatzgruppen had college degrees. 
They had Ph.D.'s in philosophy and 
literature. They were doctors. T here 
were two opera singers. And one of 
them, God save us all, had a Ph.D. 
degree in Divinity. How could these 
people who went to school ten, fifteen, 


twenty years to get their doctorates, 
how could they kill children in the 
presence of their mothers? Is it possible 
their education presented no problem 
to them? Is it possible their knowledge 
was no obstacle? 


"You see, friends, all questions 
relating to the era of darkness as 
epitomized by Auschwitz and Treb-
linka may already be found in the story 
of Riga. The criminals, the victims, 
the murder, the silence, the role of 
man and that of his God- it's all there. 
What is also there is the obsession to 
bear witness. The stubbornness of the 
killers to erase Jewish memory was 
equal only to that of the witness striv-
ing to keep it alive." 


The victims thought the world didn't 
know, Mr. Wiesel said. Some sacri-
ficed themselves so that one message 
could get out. But meanwhile, people 
in the United States read about the 
German government's policy of exter-
mination in The New York Times. "If 
anyone had told us the world knew, 
I'm afraid more people would have 
committed suicide." 


The killers knew what they were do-
ing. The world knew what was hap-
pening. "I confess to you," he said. "' 
know now but I do nat understand." 


When Mr. Wiesel finished speak-
tog, the audience stood up and clapped 
for over one · minute. One felt that 
same rush of emotion as during the 
curtain call of a moving play. But Elie 
Wiesel walked quietly off the stage, 
and when the clapping stopped, there 
was silence- long, awkward, uncer-
tain silence. Like cameraman Craig 
Rogers, no one knew what to do.
