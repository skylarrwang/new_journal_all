"The difference we'll make
Is one person who lives
would've died otherwise."
night," Howard said. He took another
drag from his cigarette, threw it on the
sidewalk, and headed back inside.

In the common room, Pete is play-
ing poker with a young couple who
heard about the shelter through their
church, and with Marty, just out of
prison and just started on methadone.
He has L-0-V-E tatooed on the
knuckles of his right hand, H-A-T-E
on the left.
"OK, here's the stakes," says Pete. "I
put up this cigarette," he says taking
out a worm-shaped Marlboro from his
pocket, "and you put up your undying
gratitude for me for teaching you to
play. So every time you see me on the
street you have to come up to me and
tell me I have your undying gratitude,
OK?"
"But I don't smoke," the wife says.
"So
I'll
get
the
cigarette.
So
everyone's happy." Marty shuffles like
the pro that he is and tells a few jokes
while he deals.

In the corner of the room, a preg-
nant girl, about seventeen, is crying,
while a volunteer host listens. "My life
has been one long disaster," she says,
in her T-shirt with BABY written in
glittery letters. Tonight Howard didn't
have room for her boyfriend, who had
just stopped by to leave the message
that he didn't want to come in anyway.
"Was he juiced up when he said that?"
she asked. He hadn't been. Howard
was sitting in the kitchen, leaning back
against the refrigerator. "Right now
she thinks I'm a creep with a capital
'C', but there's nothing I can do."

In the other room, Pete was talking
past his cigarette, over his cards.
"Sometimes, a good dinner and a good
night's sleep can really change people
around. I know it's true for me." Pete
doesn't want to become a permanent
fixture at Columbus House, though.
"If I could manage it, I'd be out of here
now," he said, talking of his plans for
an apartment. "I'd be out of here a
long time ago, but I'm lazy. I'm spir-
itually lazy and I'm physically
lazy,too. Tomorrow I have to go to
work. You know why? 'Cause I don't
have any more money. Otherwise I
wouldn't work," he laughed. "I used to
be a very successful man. I had
everything, a wife, a job, but then I
lost it. 'Cause of the alcohol."


What other events send people to
the streets? Doug used to be a real-
estate broker, "but money got tight,"
he said. Scottie, when asked what
brings him to New Haven, said, "the
Connecticut five-cent deposit law. I
could earn more money here than I
could lifting furniture for three dollars
an hour back in New Jersey." For
others like Randy, the shelter is just an
overnight stop before a new job or a
move down south as winter approach-
es. "Oh, I hope it snows tomorrow,"
one of the student volunteers said, his
enthusiasm dying as he looked up at
the faces looking at him.
"No you don't," said Randy, who
kept thumbing through the classified
section.

At 9 p.m., the minibus arrives to
take students home,
and
station
wagons pull out of the parking lot and
head towards the suburbs. The guests
file up to the dorm rooms, with fresh
linen and bathrobes.

Smelling of cigarette smoke, Liz was
on the minibus back to Yale. "For the
first time, I realized that those people
are human," she said. "I was walking
home from the library late last night
and saw a guy going through the gar-
bage can. Could he have been at the
shelter tonight?" Did she plan to
volunteer again? "It made me look too
closely. I'm not sure that I want to go
back." But she did.
"What struck me about the people
there wasn't how different they are,
but how much we have in common,
some sort of human constant we all
share. They talk like my parents
around the dinner table, and except
for last night they're usually in pretty
good spirits, not depressing to be
around at all."

That night had been bad. Someone
had stolen June's bicycle. "It was like
her Cadillac," said Ed. "It was all she
had." June sat by herself in the com-
mon room watching "Happy Days,"
occasionally laughing harshly, out of
sync with the laugh track.

Pete leaned against the wall in the
hall. "I went to church today, over to
St. Mary's to pray. I was the only one
there. I said, 'Hey, it's me again. I
know I just come here to ask for
things, but God,' " he laughed, " 'I
need another break.' " He had been
looking for housing all day with no
luck. "I can't sleep here at night," he
said. "There's so many crazy people
here, and I'm gonna be crazy soon if I
can't get out. I keep hitting my head
against the wall and it doesn't even feel
better when I stop anymore." His
breath smelled of chronic oblivion, of
too many bottles in brown paper bags.
"But don't get me wrong," he said, "this
is a good place. It saved my life."
