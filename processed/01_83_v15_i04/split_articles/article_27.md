Looking for a cure: Gloria, a diabetic, participates In Dr. DeFronzo's 
40 The New Journal/january 21, 1983 
Glucose Metabolism Experiment. 
Matt (not his real name) fought 
against gagging. The small tube, a 
fiberoptic bronchoscope, eased deeper 
into his throat, and the doctor com-
plimented him on suppressing his 
gags. As the tube passed down his 
throat, Matt felt discomfort, but there 
was no pain. His eyes were watering, 
and he remembers feeling "something 
strange" in his lungs, "something cruis-
ing around down there." His throat 
was numb, anesthetized with Lido-
caine in order to relieve his almost 
unbearable desire to gag. "They (the 
doctor and staff) kept complimenting 
me-'You're doing beautiful,'- and 
passing saline solution (to wash cells 
from the lung), and rm doing a good 
Lidocaine buzz-like having done 
coke . . . " At the end of ten minutes, 
the tube comes out of Matt's lungs, 
and the experiment is over: The doctor 
has some of Matt's lung cells and Matt 
has $120. After four hours of X-rays, 
blood tests and just waiting around 
reading magazines Matt left. "Each 
time (he did this experiment twice) I 
bounced out of the place happy to have 
survived, and they owed me $120." 
Like 
hundreds 
of other Yale 
students and New Haven residents, 
Matt has done an experiment at the 
Yale-New Haven Medical Center. For 
a relatively minor amount of work and 
some discomfort, Matt earned thirty 
dollars an hour. He can do this experi-
ment, 
a 
bronchial lavage and 
brushing, every six weeks. 


Although some subjects participate 
in medical experiments for the satisfac-
tion of helping others, most students 
do the experiments to pick up some 

quick cash. It is possible that a student 
could make a pretty good living rent-
ing himself out to science. The pay 
varies with the discomfort of the pro-
tocol. You can get $4 an hour for 
answering questions about your acne, 
or you can get about $600 for risking a 
spinal tap. 

The spinal tap (performed at Con-
necticut Mental HeaJth Center) is one 
of the most painful and potentially 
dangerous experiments. The doctor 
inserts a needle into the spine and ex-
tracts a small amount of the fluid sur-
rounding it. Because the tap alters the 
delicate balance of fluid in the central 
nervous system, the procedure results 
in spinal headaches-headaches worse 
than most migraines. Not all studies 
are this painful, but most involve some 
discomfort. How often can someone 
be a subject? And are there dangers in-
volved from repeated testing? 

Opportunities and risks 
There are many opportunities to 
become subjects. Posters requesting 
paid samaritans are often placed in 
~ale Station and neighborhood shop-
pmg centers. The Medical School's 
Human Investigation Committee 
(HIC) alone a,:proves over 250 ex-
periments each year, each requiring 
~en or more subjects. So if you're will-
mg to take some risks, it's not difficult 
to be accepted into one of these 
studies. 

Ralph DeFronzo, Associate Pro-
fessor of Medicine at Yale, is one of 
the doctors performing experiments on 
human subjects. "I wouldn't ask some-
one to do something I wouldn't do my-
self," he says. DeFronzo estimates that 
he has been a subject in 60-70 percent 
of his studies and that overall he has 
participated in over 300 experiments. 
He admits that there is a small risk in 
every experiment. But he points out 
that. each experiment involving human 
~ubjects is carefully reviewed by HIC. 
From talking to people (in the medical 
community) I've found that the Yale 
Committee is one of the toughest in 
the country," says DeFronzo. The 
Committee, comprised of both doctors 
and lay people, even supervises those 
~xperiments performed off campus by 
ale 
faculty, 
staff and 
medical 
students. 

In order to assure that the doctor's 
power over a subject is not abused, 
HIC reviews both the consent form 
and the scientific design of each ex-
periment. The non-medical HIC 
members from the community review 
the consent form to insure that most 
people from 
the community can 
understand the implication of a par-
ticular experiment. The doctor also 
plays an important role in informing 
the subject about what he is getting 
himself into. Dr. DeFronzo, who is not 
a member of H IC, will often explain 
the protocol and then have the subject 
explain it back to him in order to see 
that there is a complete understand-
mg. 

In compliance with HIC guidelines, 
the doctors informed Matt before he 
began of the risks involved in his ex-
periment. The consent form listed the 
possible dangers: "If you participate in 
this study, you will be exposed to cer-
tain risks of physical injury. These in-
clude 1) possible lung infection due to 
retained fluid, 2) spasm of the airways 
due to the fluid, and 3) minor blood 
streaking of the sputum (saliva and 
mucus) as a result of the brushing and 
fluid washing. In addition, it is possi-
ble that in the course of these studies, 
new adverse effects of this procedure 
that result in physical harm may be 
discovered. Medical therapy will be of-
fered at no cost to you for any of the 
aforementioned physical injuries." 

In Matt's case no serious side effects 
resulted from the experiment. For two 
days after the bronshocopy he had "the 
deepest sore throat imaginable." He 
felt tired and brought up fluid from his 
lungs as the consent form explained he 
would. His bronchitis was inflamed. 
However he did not feel that the ex-
periment had been a major inconven-
ience, and he did it a second time. "I 
like the people and felt secure in their 
hands," he explained. Of course the 
money played an important part in his 
decision to continue the experiment. 
"I'm very into having money," he said. 

Another factor in Matt's decision to 
do the experiment was his faith in the 
doctor's ability. Because medical ex-
periments involve complicated tech-
nical procedures or knowledge, the pa-
tient often feels like an intelligent 
guinea pig. He has no choice but to ac-
