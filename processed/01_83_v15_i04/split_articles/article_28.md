EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
had stayed out late the night before 
and 
was 
very 
tired. 
She does 
remember waking up when an atten-
dant replaced some blood that had 
been taken from the catheter. He 
replaced the blood too quickly and she 
felt an "odd surging" in her body. After 
the experiment was over, she couldn't 
walk very well. When Sally told the 
doctors this, "They didn't seem too 
sympathetic." For the next week she 
had a large bruise on her leg and small 
"vampire-like" marks on her arms. 
Three weeks later she received her 
check for $100. I asked her if she was 
thinking of doing any other experi-
ments. "Funny you should ask that 
because I was just debating doing a 
hormone experiment." 

Clearly though, the testing is not for 
everyone. Sally thinks that some peo-
ple might find it unduly stressful: "I 
think I have a higher tolerance for 
gross and disgusting and painful 
things," she says. 

Whether or not Sally learned from 
her experience, the data gathered from 
her body will help those who are 
diabetic. The experiment Sally 
volunteered for contributes to the 
general fund of knowledge about 
diabetes, and hopefully this knowledge 
will lead to a cure. DeFronzo has 
many diabetics who volunteer for the 
testing in order to help him arrive at 
that cure. Indeed the hope of helping 
others keeps many of his subjects com-
ing back to do the test again. Rather 
than go into a more lucrative private 
practice, DeFronzo himself stays with 
research because he finds it more ex-
citing. "I think that some of my work 
has had an impact in clinical manage-
~ent of people and that's very reward-
mg." he says. 

Medical experiments 
pay well 
because they can be uncomfonable 
and risky. But the discomfort and risk 
w~ich an experiment poses are a small 
pnce to pay to cure a disease such as 
diabetes. Whether or not Sally and 
others volunteered for an experiment 
strictly for the cash, someone out there 
will be thankful.
