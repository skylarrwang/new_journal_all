She did not know the names of the peo-
ple who were coming that night and 
she was not certain what she was going 
to do once she had filmed them telling 
their stories. It was May 2, 1979. In-
side a small office near Yale-New 
Haven Hospital, 
Laurel Vlock, a 
short, thin 56-year-old independent 
television producer, checked the posi-
tions of the camera and the chairs. She 
was fiddling with the armchair in the 
corner when Eva Benda walked in. 
"The startling thing for me," Mrs. 
Vlock recalled, "was that I knew Eva 
Benda. She was the wife of a Yale pro-
fessor who had been very, very gra-
cious to me. He was a frequent guest 
on my television program. And I had 
met his wife. I had heard her accent 
but ... I can only plead stupidity, ig-
norance. What can I say?" 

They were in Dr. Dori Laub's 
office,on the second floor of a brown 
high rise on Howard Avenue. Mrs. 
Vlock had brought the camera crew. 
Dr. Laub, a Yale-affiliated psychiatrist 
and a survivor of a Nazi concentration 
camp, found four Holocaust survivors 
willing to be interviewed, one of whom 
was Eva Benda. 

Mrs. Benda sat in the padded arm-
chair Mrs. Vlock had arranged in one 
corner of the 16'-by- 14' room that just 
barely accommodated all the people 
and equipment. The camera focused 
on Mrs. Benda; Dr. Laub and Mrs. 
Vlock sat out of the camera's range. 
"Where are you from?" Dr. Laub 
asked. 
"I grew up in Czechoslovakia," Mrs. 
Benda said. "I went to school there and 
lived there through my teens." 
"Do you remember very much?" 
"Oh, yes. I remember the walks we 
used to take up to the castle on the hill 
and then back." 

M~s . Benda sat stiffiy in the chair. 
Sh~ IS a short woman with a sturdy 
bu1ld and a look very different from 
Mrs. Vlock. Mrs. Vlock has an emo-
tive face- wide eyes with wrinkled 
pockets and an expression that seems 
to r~veal some strange mixture of in-
tensuy, impatience and fatigue. Mrs. 
Benda has much more impenetrable 
features- a taut face with dark thick 
eyebrows accenting her features: Mrs. 
~enda spoke matter-of-factly, almost 
Impersonally, 
about arriving at 
Laurel Vlock, co-founder of the proJect 
Auschwitz, being stripped, 
shaved 
and marched naked past German 
soldiers with machine guns. Only the 
subtle movements of her face, the 
slight tightening of one corner of her 
lip, the tension in her smile, betrayed 
the controlled exterior. 

Mrs. Benda did not cry. But by the 
time she finished her story, Mrs. Vlock 
and the camera crew were in tears. 
The camerawoman 
was not sure 
whether to stop taping when Mrs. 
Vlock, her voice high-pitched and 
broken, stumbled over her words: 
"1-1-1 ... I just want to hold you 
and be your family," she told Mrs. 
Benda. "I don't want you to be alone." 
"Thank you," Mrs. Benda said. •y 
appreciate that." 

The camera shut down but the 
awkwardness remained. "Nobody 
seemed to know what to do," Mrs. 


Benda later explained. "To shake 
hands and say goodbye didn't seem ap· 
propriate." But two other surivors, 
Leon Weinberg and Sally Horowitz, 
were already waiting in the adjoining 
room. Walking through the waiting 
room, Mrs. Benda noticed Mrs. Hor-
owitz had brought her husba:nd along 
for support. Mrs. Benda recalled, "I 
didn't like going home alone." 

Mrs. Vlock knew the next survivor, 
Leon Weinberg, as an amiable and 
successful baker in Hamden. He had 
baked a special cake with raisins and 
fruit in it for her parents' anniversary 
several years earlier. 
"The only thought in them days was 
hunger," Mr. Weinberg told his inter-
viewers, his watery eyes expressing 
simple, unsuppressed sadnes!J. "When 
you're hungry, it gets to a point where 
you don't mind stealing from your own 
sister, from your own father. I would 
get up in the middle of the night and 
slice a piece of bread off my sister's ra· 
tion." 
"Leon, I tell you ," Mrs. Vlock said 
at the conclusion of his story. "When I 
think of speaking to you in a normal 
way to order a cake . . . " 

The last survivor that night was 
Renee Hartman, an art dealer, writer 
andJewish activist. Her husband, Yale 
professor Geoffrey Hartman, later 
became an adviser to the project. 
Although she was in her mid-forties, 
Mrs. Hartman had a very young, in-
nocent face and very fair skin that 
flushed as the taping progressed. 

Separated from her parents and 
abandoned on the streets of Bratislava, 
Czechoslovakia, by a farmer who 
would no longer hide her, Mrs. Hart-
man, then nine years old, assumed 
responsiblity for her deaf sister, then 
seven. For three weeks, the two girls 
wandered the streets of this town where 
almost all the Jews, including their 
parents, had already been transported 
away to the camps. 
"I suddenly realized," Mrs. Hart· 
man said, "I might have been one of 
the last Jews in the town. I remember 
thinking, 'I don't want to be the last 
one alive.'" 

In desperation, she and her sister 
gave themselves up to the Gestapo and 
were eventually sent to Bergen-Belsen 
concentration camp. "When I was in 


camp," Mrs. Hartman said , "I man-
aged to find a roll of toilet paper and I 
managed also to barter something I 
had for a pencil. I was writing down 
everything that was happening to me, 
my longings, my fears. At one point 
this roll was found in one of the search-
es by the soldiers. I remember seeing 
the soldier sitting on the lower bunk 
reading it and laughing and finding it 
very amusing. When I rushed up to 
snatch it, he pulled it away and said, 
'No, this is 1 
good for you.' One of 
the things I remember him saying was, 
'She has a wonderful sense of humor.' 
And I didn't re ·~ mber anything funny 
in it. I remer ..er saying, 'you may 
have taken that roll but you haven't 
stopped me.from writing.'" 

Taping ended at about 
a.m. 
Laurel Ylock drove to her home in 
Hamden and hardly slept for the next 
three nights. She realized this was the 
beginning of a much larger project. Al-
though many books, documentaries 
and audiotapes already depicted the 
survivors' experiences, no medium ac-
tually showtd them telling their stories. 
To witness each witness's painful ex-
cavation of memory, to watch Renee 
Hartman demonstrate with her hands 
ho~ the German soldier unrolled her 
makeshift diary, was like watching the 
person relive the event. 
"I didn't know what to do with this 
stuff," Mrs. Vlock said. "This wasn't 
like reading it." 



**Title: The Farband**

II. 
The Farband meets in the downstairs 
room of The Westville Synagogue at 3 
p.m. on the first Sunday of every 
month. They are a lively, jovial group 
of middle-aged Jewish couples. They 
speak Yiddish at their meetings and 
contribute money to the UnitedJewish 
Appeal, Israel Bonds, and tree-plant-
ing in Israel. 

The Farband's president, William 
Rosenberg, is a genial, gre~arious man 
who somewhat paternalistically refers-
to the members as "my membership." 
He explained that the Farband is a 
kind of family. Most of the group's 120 
members are Holocaust survivors, 
many of whom lost all of their real 
family during the war. Mr. Rosen-
berg, for example, is the only one of96 
relatives to survive; his mother starved 
to death while he and his six brothers 
and sisters could do nothing but offer 
her a glass of water. 

Mrs. Vlock and Dr. Laub came to 
Mr. Rosenberg's group on June 3, 
1979, to ask for money to edit and 
make more tapes. Because of the old 
age of most survivors, Mrs. Vlock told 
them, it is important to begin taping 
before there are no survivors left. 
'"The survivors survived in order to 
bear witness,"' she 
said , 
quoting 
novelist Elie Wiesel. It was not a new 
idea for the Farband but it did evoke 
many contradictory feelings. Some of 
those present still had trouble talking 
about their experiences. Most of them 
discovered when they came to the 
United States after the war that people 
did not want to hear what had hap-
pened to them. Many, like Sylvia 
~tatlender, had not spoken about it 
smce they came to this country. The 
only survivor in a family of more than 
100, Mrs. Statlender said that not only 
did others not want to hear but also 
thought to herself, "It's terrible. What 
are you going to say?" But she also 
wondered why she alone survived, and 
thought that maybe it was because God 
Wanted her to tell what happened. 

When Mrs. Vlock spoke, Mrs. Stat-
l':nder cried. To Mrs. Vlock, the au-
daence looked haunted. 
•It was very painful for Laurel and it 
was very painful for my members," 
Mr. Rosenberg recalled. Before the 
meeting was over, 
the 
Farband 
pledged $1,700 to the project. More 
than 60 of them later agreed to be 
filmed; approximately 18 of them had 
never talked about it before. 

One thing puzzled some of the Far-
band members: Why would Laurel 
Vlock, a 
well-off, American-born 
woman with a nice home in the 
suburbs and no relatives from the 
camps, want to hear about the horrible 
things that happened to them? Some 
suspected a profit motive. Others 
assumed she wanted to distinguish 
herself professionally. Still others, in-
cluding Mrs. Rosenberg, believed she 
did it because she is "a good Jew." 

Mrs. Vlock was encouraged to begin 
this project after the success of an 
award-winning documentary she 
filmed on the dedication of the 
Holocaust Memorial in New Haven. 
But she had always been deeply con-
cerned about the Holocaust. She was 
twelve years old when the war broke
