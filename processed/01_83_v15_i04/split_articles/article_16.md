out, and because her parents were 
Jewish activists, it disrupted life in her 
home. "We talked about 
this 
endlessly," she said. "My parents were 
very upset. There were all kinds of 
meetings, letters, phone calls. It was 
part of the fabric of my life.". 

III. 
In November, 1979, Laurel Vlock 
travelled to Germany, Austria, and 
Czechoslovakia to see the scenes of the 
stories she had been told. "I had to feel 
where these people came from," she 
said. "I could no longer go on talking to 
them and have no real sense of the 
landscape." 
At Dachau concentration camp in 
West Germany, she walked through 
the bleak parade ground . where a 
monument to the dead now stands but 
once thousands of the living stood to be 
counted. 
"It was cold," Mrs Vlock said. "And 
I remember the first thing I ever heard 
was Eva Benda talking about how bit-
terly cold it can be in Poland in the fall. 
It was bitter cold. And it was bleak and 
it was damp. It was miseraQie to walk 
around there for even an hour, and I 
was properly dressed. I couldn't stop 
visualizing those people standing there 
for hours on end. I thought I under-
stood it at the time that she said it, but 
I don't really think I understood it until 
I was there. 
"The thing that bothered me the 
most, really gives me the chills: to be in 
there and to know that everything you 
knew was outside and nothing that you 
knew was inside, but this was your 
world. To be physically near the walls, 
knowing there was just this thing, this 
cement, between you and the rest of 
the world." 
She also went to Mauthausen con-
centration camp in Austria- an im-
posing, cold stone fortress on a hill. 
Mauthausen was less a monument or a 
museum, more a concentration camp 
that had been abandoned. At Ausch-
witz, there were extensive written and 
photographic 
displays. 
At 
Mauthausen, 
there 
was 
a 
small 
museum but no guides or directions. 
"There are gas chambers and torture 
rooms underneath," Mrs. Vlock said, 
"but no one to show you where they 
are. You have to find them for 
yourself." 


The six members of Vlock's group 
wandered through the place. In some 
spots, people had pasted pictures of lost 
relatives on the wall alongside wreaths 
and flowers. Mrs. Vlock found one of 
the gas chambers; it was a 15'-by-15' 
square room with concrete walls and a 
heavy metal door. One light bulb 
dangled from the ceiling. The gas jets 
resembled shower heads, but upon see-
ing them Mrs. Vlock was sure the vic-
tims had known they were not shower 
heads as soon as they had entered the 
room. 
Mrs. Vlock came all the way from 
Vienna to see this place because her 
son had been there nine years before 
on a United Jewish Appeal trip for col-
lege students. The students walked in-
side the gas chambers. One of the 
group leaders switched ofT the light and 
slammed the door. Mrs. Vlock had 
read her son's diary describing that ex-
perience before she went to Europe. 
Now, 
alone in this part of the 
underground of Mauthausen, 
she 
closed the chamber door behind her. 
She wanted to hear the sound that her 
son- and the victims- had heard. 
"But something else came to me at 
that time, when I was in that room," 
Mrs. Vlock remembered. "I never 
~\ 
heard it described by anyone else this 
way. This was a man, a survivor I had 
taped, who described the clean-up 
detail he was assigned to. When they 
would push everyone into the room, it 
would be filled to capacity. When the 
doors opened, the room was only one-
third 
full. 
The reason was 
that 
everybody pressed to one corner to get 
away from the jets and towards where 
the air was pure. So when they opened 
up the doors each and every time, all 
the bodies were pressed into one-third 
the space." 
Towards the end of her visit to 
Mauthausen, Mrs. Vlock felt numbed 
and then felt 
guilty about being 
numbed. But to this day, she said, she 
remembers the configuration of the 
grass, the cement paths. She remem-
bers the face of the survivor who told of 
the gas chamber~. "I can see his face, 
black hair, gutteral voice," she said. 
"He was quite matter-of-fact about it." 
One of her last stops was Bratislava. 
She went there just to see the cob-
blestone streets on which Renee Hart-
man and her sister ran before giving 
themselves up to the Gestapo. "It's a 
dreary town," Mrs. Vlock said. "Very 
grim, gray stone buildings and cob-
blestone streets." The people did not

Between February and May, 1980, 
Mrs. Vlock and Dr. Laub interviewed 
about 150 survivors in the Bank of 
New Haven Building, on Church 
Street. One of the first was Menachem 
Stern, 
heavy-set, 
thick-bearded 
Israeli who is a visiting doctor at Yale 
University Health Services. 
The crew tested the equipment as 
Stern talked about his decision to par-
ticipate in the project. Until recently, 
he told them, he had never watched 
any movies or read any books or even 
spoken about the Holocaust. Then one 
day he decided to watch the TV movie 
"Holocaust" with his family. 
"By the end of it," he said, "we were 
all crying, and my nine-year-old said 
to me, 'Hey Daddy, you're crying,' and 
I said, 'Yeah, you're crying too.' I 
asked her, 'Why are you crying here?' 
and she said, 'I cry for all those poor · 
people. Why do you cry?' I said, 'Well, 
I really cry for myself.' She said. 'What 
do you mean for yourself?' 'Well, you 
know, I was part of it.' She looked at 
me and said, 'Daddy, I never knew. 
Why didn't you tell me?' For once in 
my life, I was speechless. I realized I 
wasn't able to tell her." 
Dr. Stern was five years old when 
his parents bundled him up, stuck the 
directions to a whorehouse in his hand, 
and sent him alone at night through an 
escape route out of their labor camp 
~ear Cracow, Poland. For part of that 
ttme, he survived on his own, begging 
and stealing with other street children. 
By some miracle, both he and his 
parents survived the war, and moved 
to Israel in 1950. He was one of two 
survivors out of the 4,000 children in 
that camp. 
"I was the only survivor my age that 
I ever knew," he said in a recent inter-
view. "There was no one who could 
understand the things 
I'd been 
"If anyone had told us the 
world knew. I'm afraid more 
people would have commit· 
ted suicide." 
through." His parents would not take 
him to meetings with other survivors 
for fear he would remind the others of 
the children they had lost. They did 
not speak of the Holocaust in their 
home. So Dr. Stern denied it had any 
effect on him. He lost his accent and 
became accepted as a native Israeli 
boy. The film project provided him 
with a new beginning. "It helped me to 
come out of the closet," he said. "It 
gave me a place among survivors." 
But now Dr. Stern has another 
problem. He is not sure how and when 
to present his experiences to his two 
daughters. "Do I want it to become a 
reality for them? Should.! put them too 
much in this perspective of mine? It's 
very hard for me to trust people. I have 
what I call Jewish paranoia. Is it right 
for me to give them the same sense of 
insecurity that I have? 
"I think children should first be ex-
posed to love rather than hate, first in-
tr<x\uced to tenderness rather than 
violence. My personal story is not im-
portant. I would like them to get the 
message that they should be caring and 
loving and compassionate and under-
standing-and you know what? For-
giving. Forgiving. 
"My children hearing it from me will 
have all kinds of feelings involved 
because I am their father. But some 
day somebody's grandchildren will 
come and see us survivors talking and 
they will see how we looked, our affect 
and our tone, and they will be able to 
put it in perspective." 
Now, Dr. Stern, a man who four 
years ago was denying the Holocaust 
had any effect on him, said he would 
like to speak and teach about it in the 
future. He remembered hearing Elie 
Wiesel say, " 'There are fewer and 
fewer of us survivors, and I'd hate to be 
the last one.' " 
"I've always had the feeling that I'd 
be one of the last ones," Dr. Stern said. 
"It gives me an opportunity to fulfill 
my legacy."
