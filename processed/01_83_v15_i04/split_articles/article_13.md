**Moose Is loose, again**
**Author: Laura Pappano**
**Page number(s): 11**

It was a year ago this month that 
Yale's "Oldest R esidential College 
Daily," the Ezra Stiles Daily Moose 
Dispatch, published its first issue. 
Everyone laughed, but no one paid 
much attention in the beginning to 
the "plucky, burgeoning young 
daily." The idea was novel, but the 
founders of the DMD had a little 
more than novelty in mind when 
they cranked ou t over fot·ty issues 
during the semester and acquired a 
loyal following. And now, after a 
semester-long hiatus, the satire 
tabloid is back in print. 

A humorous, fictitious newspaper 
that chronicled events and life in 
Ezra Stiles College, the Moose made 
the nightly journey from pressroom 
3120 E.S. to G nomon Copy to the 
Ezra Stiles dining hall, where it sur-
passed the acclaimed salad bar as the 
leading topic of meal-time talk. After 
34 consecutive issues, Moose staffer 
Walter M anny '82 and W. H ampton 
Sides '84 finally had to modify the 
daily production schedule. The 
Oldest Residential College Daily then 
became the Oldest Occasional 
R esidential College Weekly Daily, a 
"revolutionary concept in printing 
frequency ." The paper explained the 
new schedule in a short notice: "The 
Moose will heretofore appear occa-
sionally daily, and daily, occasional-
ly, and not at all, occasionally, 
although never always not; but not 
always, however, for it will occa-
s~onally reappear daily, and some-
~tmes not even occasionally daily, but 
JUst plain ole daily." 

Contacted in Cambridge, former 
publisher Manny expressed surprise 
at the Moose's resurrection. "Well, I'm 
thrilled, of course, and naturaUy a bi1 
appaUed," commented Manny in a 
telephone interview. "The Moose was 
always, in my day, the pinnacle of ir-
responsible journalism, and as an 
alumnus, I would hope that the 
paper maintains its sordid position in 
the ranks of Yale publications." 

But veteran Moose staffer Thomas 
McQuillen '84 has visions for the 
J:foose that extend beyond Manny's 
JOurnalistic aims. Asked about these 
visions, Mclluillen responded 
'ou re forcing my hand. Walter was 
a funny guy, but he had no vision. 
He _th_ought it was enough to be 
sadtsttcaUy irreverent. Now we are 
Pursuing a journalistic anti-ethic. 
Our ultimate aim is the erradication 
of people's perverse addiction to truth 
in all its pitiable forms." "The only 
story we won't print," agrees co-
staffer Sides, "is anything that has its 
basis in reality. But despite this 
stipulation, it's still more believable 
than what you will find in the Yale 
Daily News." 

Last year's Moose featured behind-
the-scenes coverage of major disasters 
("Stiles Tower Collapses," "Stiles to 
Cede Gimbel Cup," "Dining Hall 
Vanishes"), scandals ("Dramat Filches 
Oil Rig," "Stiles Moose is Really a 
Mastodon, Expert Determines," "Is 
R abbit Meat Really R eally Soylent 
Green?") and athletics ("Mooses Sign 
Reggie Jackson! Ex-Yank Promises 
H e'll Capture Tyng for Stiles in '82") 
But probably the most popular story 
last year was "Luvbeat: SEX Scandal 
Rocks College," in which a "roving 
DMD shutterbug" photographed an 
"unidentified gigolo in bed with the 
A. Bartlett Giamatti Moose, telling 
an invidious tale of cheap sex, if not 
tawdry bestiality of the worst possible 
sort." 

Aside from supplying rea~ers with 
the "real scoop" ("Read your NYT to-
day, and get the inside story later"), 
th e Moose provided two advice col-
umns, "Deer Moose" and "Ask Sa-
lada," as well as its own gossip col-
umn, "Sleeping Together." It also 
featured regular cartoons by Stiles 
senior J ohn Zin sser, called "Zins-
serines," which became a trademark 
of the publication. 

Sides explains that the idea behind 
the Moosls 
was to "make 
people feel that if they didn't know 
what we were talking about, then 
they'd better find out. And 
everybody wanted to find out. We'd 
miss a day and people would be 
banging on the tables with their forks 
and knives yelling, 'We wan t Moose!" 

The new Moose has big plans for 
the semester. "Yes, we have several 
returning lettermen," says Sides, "and 
we're even thinking about going na-
tional. And I'd like to put the back 
issues in a bound volume and sell the 
book for $19.95 over midnight T.V." 

Also, there is talk of a Moose pin-up 
calendar: "Stiles Men of '83: R eal 
Men Eat Moosemeat." 

But for the most devoted staffers, 
the Moose is more than a newspaper; 
it's a whole way of life. "We don't 
just write the Moose," explains Mc-
Quillen. "We subjugate all personal 
identity to it. For instance, we began 
all our board meetings with Walter 
[Manny] chanting 'See the Moose, 
BE the Moose.' It's kind of like hot 
tubs, you know?" 

"Nothing will change," assures 
Sides. "All good things don't come to 
an end. We will still be yelling 
'Copy!' and 'Put 'er to bed boys' in 
the middle of the night. The Moose 
will continue to be outrageous and, 
of course, without journalistic 
scruples." Adds lVk Quillen, "Who 
needs the truth when smut is so 
much more fun?'·
