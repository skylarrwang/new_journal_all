and she has filmed some of the Ameri-
can liberators who were the first to 
enter the camps (among them, an 
American doctor whose hair literally 
turned white during two weeks there). 
"Each sentence of each testimony 
opens up a door," Mrs. Vlock said. 
With each new story, she finds they are 
uncovering details that may bring us 
closer to an understanding of what it 
was like. For example, only one sur-
vivor told her how prisoners in the 
camps cleaned their ration tins which 
were often caked with old food crust; 
they used their own urine because 
urine would not contaminate the food. 
Only one survivor told her how people 
in the camps would spend hours each 
day cracking the nits from their hair 
and examining their clothes for them. 
He showed on camera how they would 
crack the nits with their fingernails. 
This man was the only person to men-
tion such a crude detail, and yet, Mrs. 
Vlock said, he described people as be-
ing consumed with this activity. 
"These are the unspeakables," Mrs. 
Vlock said. "It's not in the books 
because it was disgusting. But that was 
what these people were consumed 
with. They were consumed with those 
nasty details of being. Those details 
force the recognition of what this ex-
perience was in a way that nothing else 
can." 


Mrs. Vlock said she doesn't enjoy 
hearing all of these disturbing things. 
"I certainly don't escape nightmares 
after filming." Nor does she escape 
phone calls late at night from survivors 
who can't sleep after a taping session or 
who are anxious about being filmed 
the next morning. She knows she is re-
sponsible for causing people to relive 
painful experiences, but she also knows 
what a catharsis it has been for so 
many who had kept their stories to 
themselves for so many years. Some 
brought their children to the tap-
ing-children who had never heard the 
whole story before. 


This project has affected some of her 
personal relationships as well. "There 
were some people who really had tO tell 
me they coudn't stand to talk about it," 
she said. She showed one friend a tape, 
hoping to involve her in the project. 
After watching an hour of testimony, 
the woman told Mrs. Vlock, "I don't

who really had to tell me 
they couldn't stand to talk 
about it." 
relate to the Holocaust, and I don't 
want to hear anything about it." 


Mrs. Vlock said she does not com-
pletely understand her emotional in-
volvement with the project but she 
Â· does not believe she is obsessed. She 
has other projects as well, including an 
attempt to start a female-owned televi-
sion station, and a weekly interview 
program on WTNH in New H aven. 
Still, she believes the Holocaust project 
will probably be one of the most im-
portant things she'll do in her life. She 
feels a need to leave her mark, and 
"This,"she said, "is a contribution I can 
make." 


VII. 


By November 15, 1982, the day Elie 
Wiesel spoke at the Law School 
Auditorium, the Holocaust Survivors 
Film Project had come a long way. 
Mrs. Vlock won an Emmy award for 
"Forever Yesterday," a documentary 
using survivor testimony. Through the 
support of Yale President A. Bartlett 
Giamatti and several professors and 
administrators, the collection of tapes 
became Yale's first videoarchive in 
room 331 b of Sterling Memorial Li-
brary. It also became the national 
repository for video testimony about 
the Holocaust, as several other cities 
began their own projects. Under a 
grant from the Revson Foundation, 
the project received funding to tape 
more survivors and buy machines for 
researchers and students to view the 
material. They started looking for ad-
ditional funds to create an endowment 
and for volunteers to help organize the 
vast amount of material already col-
lected. 


Although taping would continue for 
some time, the project entered a new 
phase. How would the tapes be used 
for future teaching and research? 
Would they come to mf"an as much to 
those who viewed them as those who 
made them? 


The Law School Auditorium, which 
holds about 500 people, held more 
than that number the night Mr. 
Wiesel's lecture, "Knowing and Not 
Knowing," inaugurated the video-
archive. People crowded onto the 
aisles, window ledges, and floor space 
in front of the stage. Eva Benda was
