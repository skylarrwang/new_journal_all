Dwight Hall, who was instrumental in 
planning the shelter. "Basically it is a 
very small attempt, but you can justify 
it. Last year two people froze to death, 
and one wasn't found until the spring 
thaw. If we can keep one or !WO people 
from freezing to death in 1983, then 
that's worth something, and by having 
gone through the establishing of Col-
umbus House in a careful and pain-
staking way, we hope to be a model. 
We expect to consult other groups 
opening up shelters, making it easier 
for the next ones." 

The many coordinated groups of 
concerned churchmen, social workers, 
and private citizens who originally 
conceived of Columbus House had 
trouble achieving their goal. The 
shelter had to be cleared through zon-
ing ordinances and various state and 
city regulations, not the least of which 
were the newly changed fire codes, 
which required first a standpipe, then 
an external fire excape, then an en-
closed internal one. Delays continued 
through the winter of 1982, when the 
Fair Haven shelter opened in a local 
church. This relieved pressure on Col-
umbus House to open, but also show-
ed city bureaucrats the problems of 
managing a shelter. 

As renovations proceeded slowly, 
funding agencies threatened to cut ofT 
grants. However, the project was 
saved by people like Donald Baerman, a 
prominent 
local 
architect 
who 
donated over 200 pages of plans. 
Bankers spoke at meetings; treasurers 
of multi-million dollar firms wrote 
grant proposals; Yale students planted 
gardens and painted, and one, Jesse 
Lerner, moved into the deserted con-
vent to guard it from vandals. Dwight 
Hall provided two summer interns, 
Val Pierce and Mark Dolan. Money 
appeared from churches, grants from 
the city, and countless individuals. 
Still, a $250,000 fundraiser will be 
"essential to get us through the year," 
said Hasegawa. 

The shelter's executive director, 
Cynthia De Louise, hopes to extend ef-
forts to aid the homeless on both large 
and small scales. "I'd like to expand the 
staff, but we can't afford to. We're 
desperately trying to recruit volun-
teers, especially around the holidays 
and during staff vacations," she said. 
"It's a vast task." 

DeLouise helped establish the Coa-
lition for the Homeless, which will find 
additional housing for street people 
and help the state government accept 
some responsibility 
for emergency 
shelters. New Haven provides them 
for disaster victims, people whose 
homes have frozen pipes or no heat, 
"but our folks face disaster every single 
evening of their lives," she said. "We're 
trying to present this to the govern-
ment, that there's more than just a 
disaster every so often. For these folks 
it's all the time. 

"There aren't even places where peo-
ple can get on their feet in any way," 
she said; "we try to provide bottom line 
care, the most basic opportunity for a 
street person to maintain himself. He's 
no good in a job interview if he's un-
shaven, if he smells bad, if he looks as 
if he's had no place to go." A bill before 
the legislature will help the govern-
ment take financial responsibility for 
shelters like Columbus House. With 
extra funds and staff, the fourth floor 
could be opened up for more guests, 
but renovations there would cost as 
much as the other three floors com-
bined, according to Hasegawa, and 
more volunteers would be needed for 
more guests to be sheltered. 

He spoke of Columbus House's two 
most urgent worries. "I'm afraid of 
what would happen if we ran out of 
money before we have a chance for a 
fair trial," he said, looking out the win-
dow of his Dwight Hall office. "That's 
a major problem. Times are tough and 
you see more poor people now than 
ever before. Also, I get so confused 
about the conflict between public 
regulations and the attempt just to do 
something. If the shelter violates a 
bureaucratic rule, the city'll close it. 
It's bureaucratic procedure to worry, 
correctly, about the risk of tragedy 
with a fire, but would people decide to 
close the shelter and face the risk of 
people freezing to death? It's so easy to 
run afoul of bureaucrats, especially 
those who give out money. 

"Otherwise," Hasegawa said, "I 
think the shelter's got a tremendous 
future. When you see the staff and the 
street people who are willing to help 
out, well, people are out there, and 
they're ready to support us. The dif-
ference we'll make is one person who 
lives who would've died otherwise. 

What if it's a drunk who contributes 
nothing else to society for the rest of 
his life? If it's someone in the locked 
wards of the Connecticut Valley 
Hospital costing $150 a day just to 
keep him alive, that's who we save. But 
that's not a reason not to do it. The 
alternative is to say 'let 'em freeze.'" 

Hasegawa also worries about the 
staffs ability to swallow their compas-
sion and follow the rule that limits the 
shelter to giving beds to only 35 guests. 
"People there will toughen up real 
quick," he said. "I hope they won't 
become callous, but they'll have to 
determine the difference between a 
regular, who they'll know will at least 
get a roof or a cardboard box, and a 
kid who's not from around here, who 
has nothing at all in 34 degree 
weather. It'll always be the instinct of 
the volunteers to help them both, but 
the staff will have to make decisions 
like this 15 times every single night." 

DeLouise worries most about staff 
burnout, and she tries to ensure that 
the live-in residential aides get suffi-
cient vacations in order to rest up from 
the noisy and sleepless nights spent 
keeping a floor full of street people 
under control. All of the live-in staff 
are recovered alcoholics, which en-
ables them to have a special rapport 
with the guests. 

Undying gratitude 
The house manager, Howard McCar-
thy, used to be a drug addictÂ· but 
brought himself through a detoxifica-
tion program. He sits on the stoop in 
front of Columbus House, smoking a 
cigarette and looking out across the 
high school track. "It was a rough 
day," he said, "and after yesterday 
worked out so well." The night before, 
the h03pital had called with a family 
with two kids, on the way to the de-tox 
center. They were from Florida and 
knew no one. "But I couldn't just turn 
them away, especially when we had 
room," he said, even though the couple 
arrived after 9 p.m., after the cop had 
left and registration ended for security 
reasons. Although he had to face 
criticism for his decision to admit the 
family, Howard said, "I couldn't just 
kick them one more time. I've been 
through that myself." 

Howard's eyes look very tired, his 
forehead is furrowed. He lives in Col-
umbus House and has to deal with 
cleaning up after meals, doing the 
laundry, and making sure that nothing 
goes wrong among the entire floor of 
unruly men he oversees. "I have to do 
something. I don't know if it's going to 
be at Columbus House or not but I 
have to do something. Right now I 
don't want to hear about Columbus 
House again," he said, thinking about 
the short tempers and few late nights 
behind him, and how many more 
would follow. He looked up past the 
freshly refinished gingerbread over the 
door, up into the soft autumn night. 
"I've been living here since June. 
When I think of all the work that went 
into this place, and all sorts of people 
donating time and stuff for all this to 
work, I don't know, it restores my faith 
in people." 

What's going to happen when it gets 
really cold, when more than 35 people 
line up before 4:30, and familiar faces . 
have to stay outside? "I can't imagine 
turning people away on a snowy
