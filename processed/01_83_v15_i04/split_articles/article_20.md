June walked up the steps of the ivy-
covered brick building with the suit-
case she had just bought to replace her 
shopping bags. Behind her was the 
cold street, in front of her the smell of 
fresh paint and simmering supper. She 
walked towards the desk, where the at-
tendant hung up her torn green over-
coat, put her suitcase in a closet, and 
put the contents of her pockets in a

small cardboard box. It wasn't much: a 
comb, a bandana, C erts, a pen, a few 
sheets of paper. The house manager 
took her name and age, while a cop 
frisked her before she could walk down 
the hall, past the smoke-filled common 
room to the dining room in the back. 
She took a seat at the long table, 
waiting for six o'clock and spaghetti. 
Columbus House, the only perma-
nent shelter for the homeless in New 
Haven, opened on November 1, 1982. 
It wasn't very crowded several days 
later when June arrived . The desk at-
tendant said people were spending 
their recently-received welfare checks 
on booze. It had been a mild fall, so 
they weren't suffering from the cold 
yet. Later, June and dozens of other 
street people would line up each night, 
hoping to get one of the shelter's 35 
beds. 

Once she is registered and fed, June 
talks to a night host, a volunteer who 
spends a few hours at the shelter talk-
ing to the guests, playing cards, listen-
ing. "I don't like that 30 cent lady," she 
told Liz, a Yale student who asked her 
if she knew many of the street people 
around the campus. "She's a pan-
handler. She lives off other people's 
money. Same with those people who 
fake disablity to be on welfare, the 
ones who were sick ten years ago and 
come in and say they still aren't 
better." June is 44 and once worked as 
a secretary. She gets $53 from welfare 
every two weeks. She's tired, goes into 
the other room to take a nap. 

The newly renovated building on 
Columbus Avenue used to be a con-
vent. Now, cigarette smoke envelops 
the two bare lightbulbs which hang 
from the high ceiling in the hall. A line 
of men lean against the blue walls as if 
they were hanging out in front of the 
Mall downtown. To the right is the 
common room with second-hand sofas 
and chairs along the off-white walls so 
everyone can watch the television, 
which is constantly on. Behind is the 
kitchen, restricted to the staff. A din-
ing room across the hall is filled with 
three long tables and a salad bar from 
which volunteers serve dinner. 

Pete is sitting at the far table, piling 
one spoon on top of another. His 
hands tremble, especially when he 
lights up a cigarette, which is often. 
He looks 60 but is only 45 and wears a 
navy blue sweater, plaid pants and 
new shoes. He is one of the better 
dressed guests. Before coming here, he 
worked and lived at the Salvation Ar-
my but lost his job there for drinking 
and being in a fight. He~d been hit 
with a chain, and has angry-looking 
bruises on his cheekbones, one of 
which is broken. His right eye is 
bloodshot; the other stares starkly 
from his weathered, unshaven face. 
Still, with a good scrubbing, he could 
look like your father. 

"College," he laughed, talking to 
Liz. "A long, long time ago I went to 
college, in Colorado. I came out to 
New York and got a good job, one that 
paid." He laughed. "I forget the title I 
had then, something like supervisor of 
the whole printing outfit. I had so 
much money I didn't know what to do 
with it. It just came in and went out. 
Boy was that a good time." 

Pete came to New Haven because of 
the Shirley Frank Foundation, a center 
for alcoholics. "See. I'm an alcoholic. 
Of my whole family, only my mother 
wasn't an alcoholic." He went on the 
wagon and helped manage the founda-
tion but returned to drinking. Since 
the fight a week ago, he's lived with an 
ex-girlfriend, some buddies, and spent 
only three or four days on the street. 
He now takes odd jobs through an 
employment service and is a regular at 
Columbus House, although he plans 
to rent a room of his own when he can 
save up some of his welfare money. 

"Where's a good place to sleep when 
you're out on the street?" another stu-
dent volunteer asked. 

"There is no good place," Pete said. 
"Hey, Ed, gimme a light." 

Ed is a 46-year-old father of seven 
who used to be a reporter in Water-
bury. He and Pete have been friends 
ever since they came to New Haven. 
Before that they lived in New York. 
"I'd walk around all night, then go to 
the library to sleep all day. You'd sit 
with a newspaper facing the librarian 
so she couldn't see you, and you'd sleep 
for hours," Pete said. Now the two of 
them spend a lot of time on the Green. 
"Yesterday we were in the park," said 
Pete, "and Ed says to me, 'Look at that 
squirrel hiding his nuts. When it 
snows, he won't. ever be able to find 
them.' And the next day here we were 
~ooking all around New Haven for the 
JUgs Ed's hidden. He can't find them 
either, just like the squirrel." The two 
exchange war stories as if this were a 
cocktail party. 

"I spent the best years of my life in 
the war, from when I was 17 till 21. 
Now I'm too old for a paper route and 
too young for social security," Ed said 
with a smile. "I should have cut my 
finger in the war, gotten a purple heart 
and disability. As it is, they have us 
working on Veterans' Day. And us 
veterans." 

Tonight dinner is served by Stiles 
College, which along with several 
other Yale organizations has adopted 
the shelter for a few dinners a month , 
cooking, serving and cleaning up for 
the guests and staff. After d inner a 
group of students talk to Pete about 
the city. "Wouldn't you feel safer closer 
to the Green and to campus, where all 
the cops are?" Pete looks up at them. 
His eyes have recovered from their 
bruises, but not from the long nights 
outside, alone. "If the cops saw me 
there, they'd arrest me as a vagrant," 
he said. He changed the topic to 
movies. "If I renew it every six 
months, I have a lite membership to 
the Yale Film Society." Soon the group 
was laughing about old gangster films 
and comparing favorites. "Anything 
you're learning in that film course of 
yours, I could teach you three times as 
"Prosperity," sneered Pete. 
"Drunks hate prosperity." 
much," said Pete. "I used to be a junior 
high English teacher." 

"You know, at one time I was bring-
ing home $1,000 a week as a printer," 
Ed said. 

"Prosperity," sneered Pete. "Drunks 
hate prosperity. Yesterday afternoon I 
had $65. Today I'm broke. I gave it 
away. I gave it to the guys on the 
street, to the bums. Only I don't like 
the word 'bum. 'Nobody's a bum. But 
you help them out, and then when 
you're down and need something, 
they'll help you. I must know every 
drunk in New Haven." 

A new roof 
Estimates 
figure 
the 
number of 
homeless in this city to be between 250 
and 400. Tonight in the alleys between 
those stone and metal buildings in the 
skyline the shelter faces, approximate-
ly ten times the number of people stay-
ing at Columbus House are making 
do, sleeping near steam vents, under 
newspapers, shrinking into themselves 
against the dark cold. Is this one new 
shelter a mere token effort, doing 
nothing to change a faulty social 
system? 

"I react strongly to the opinion that 
we're just band-aids, not solving the 
underlying problems," said Jack 
Hasegawa, General Secretary of 
Ray and Jeff talclng It easy on the couch.
