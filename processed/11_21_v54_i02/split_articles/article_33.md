From Harvard came Facebook, from Stanford 
came Google. Will Yale be next to gain Silicon Val­
ley fame?

On a Sunday afternoon in mid-September, a 
group of twenty-odd students gathered in an other­
wise empty Watson Center. Staring intently at their 
screens and typing in silent determination, the stu­
dents worked with unwavering focus on their con­
tribution to the internet’s next major site. Welcome 
to the future, readers. Marvin Kombat Bulldog Bash 
lies just around the corner.

Students in Amoriem Labs, a video game design 
club of undergraduates, are developing a Yale-
themed street fighter game, akin to a simplified Super 
Smash Bros or Tekken. Instead of dueling with Kirby, 
Peach or Falco, however, players of this soon-to-
drop game will fight as Marvin Chun, Peter Salovey 
or Handsome Dan, throwing punches and dodging 
fire-powered blows on a pixelated replica of Yale’s 
campus. 

Modeled after nineteen-eighties video and arcade 
games, Marvin Kombat Bulldog Bash can be played 
as a “local multiplayer,” in which opposing players 
control their respective fighters from opposite sides 
of the same keyboard. Two students sitting next to 
each other in section mashing away on the same key­
board might have a hard time avoiding detection by 
their professor, but club leaders have tentative plans 
to make single-player and online multiplayer ver­
sions as well.

Eric Doddy, a club member majoring in art, 
demonstrates the process by which he creates the 
Salovey, Chun and Handsome Dan images. After he 
sketches the characters on paper, he recreates them 
on his tablet with remarkable precision. Perhaps most 
impressive are Amoriem’s Salovey and Chun avatars: 
though the two differ by little other than hair color, 
most students will likely be able to easily identify the 
two.

To simulate continuous movement in the avatars, 
the game toggles rapidly between a set of hand-
drawn frames. When players unleash their attacks 
and behold, say, their Salovey character launching 
a lethal kick, they are really watching the program 
rotate rapidly through a series of images: Salovey 
standing upright, Salovey half-way through his kick, 
Salovey finishing his kick. Be it Handsome Dan 
blocking a punch or Marvin Chun jumping through 
the air, every movement of each character requires 
its own unique set of drawings. If the game’s cre­
ators continue to add features to the game—a chicken 
tender attack and DUO mobile buffering traps are 
among the proposals under consideration—even 
more frames will be required.

Amoriem’s scrupulous attention to detail can 
also be seen in the game’s audio, which features a  
backdrop of independently-composed music. Ethan 
Pesikoff, a junior majoring in Math and Near Eastern 
Languages and Civilizations, did much of the work 
to create the game’s current soundtrack. He says the 
music for Bulldog Bash is inspired by a Balkan folk 
music band—Taraf de Haidouks—that he “really likes 
a lot.” To make the music for the game, Pesikoff 
begins by composing a melody and writing out the 
notes—he does so on a computer program but points 
out a student to his right who was doing the same 
with a pencil and a piece of paper—and then adapts 
the tune to match the game’s retro style. In its cur­
rent form, the music’s computer-generated notes 
carry the energy of Halloween-themed trance music 
written for pre-2000 Nintendo.

One possible issue the club could face is its use of 
the names and likenesses of university officials. Asked 
whether she was concerned about such a prospect, 
student leader Christie Yu was undisturbed. “Worst 
case I think we can just change Peter Salovey to Seter 
Palovey or something like that,” Yu said. 

The creators of Bulldog Bash expect the game’s 
old-school style to be popular among students, but 
the design’s simplicity also makes the avatars’ move­
ments easier to replicate. “The pixelated style gives us 
more room for our own input,” Doddy says. On his 
screen he pulls up a series of hyper-detailed drawings 
he has sketched for other games—mystical-looking 
knight characters with cloaks and long daggers—and 
explains how labor-intensive it would be to hand-
draw the necessary number of frames for such elabo­
rately-drawn characters. The game’s relative simplic­
ity also gestures to the club’s main goal: to provide 
interested students with a space to develop their 
game-designing skills. 

In their north campus meeting spot, the club’s 
members sit around rectangular arrays of tables and 
form mini-departments of impressive efficiency—the 
musical composition team sits at a set of tables in the 
room’s center, with the graphic design team across 
from them and the coding team to their left. With 
nearly two dozen students working on the game at 
once, the group maintains levels of focus and con­
centration reserved usually for final exams; rarely 
was the quiet clatter of steady typing interrupted by 
anything louder than a cough. Halfway through the 
meeting, Isabella Yang, a student-leader working on 
Planet 112—a space colonization game that Amor­
iem is also creating—suggested to her team that they 
take a short break. The students in her group quickly 
clicked onto other tabs, closed their laptops, or qui­
etly pushed out their chairs to stretch their legs for 
the prescribed rest. No such breaks were announced 
on the other side of the room, where the club mem­
bers continued working with tireless commitment 
on their chicken tender assaults and Handsome Dan 
defenses. Though a far cry from The Social Network’s 
scenes of adrenaline-fueled coding marathons inter­
rupted only by shots of vodka and the cheers of beau­
tiful women, the group impresses in its own way.

As to when exactly the game will be available to 
play: Yu shares a concerned look with the clubmate 
to her left. “I mean, we say it every year but … defi­
nitely this year.” She pauses, then nods vigorously 
twice. “Definitely this year. For sure.”
