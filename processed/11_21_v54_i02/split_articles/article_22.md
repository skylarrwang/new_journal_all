Somebody help! I have COVID and I’m 
standing alone outside Maison Mathis
“Yeah, I’m getting into the rhythm of classes and 
everything, and I’m just feeling like I have my sea 
legs,” a close friend told me four weeks into this 
semester––the first of my senior year. I remember 
looking down at my own legs then and thinking, 
these are not sea legs.   

Three weeks earlier, on the first Friday of the 
semester, on the day before my twenty-second birth­
day, a year and a half after the start of the pandemic, 
six months after my second dose of Pfizer, roughly a 
week after I had gone to a friend’s birthday party in 
Bushwick, and a day before I ended up alone out­
side Maison Mathis, I opened the MyChart app on 
my phone to check my weekly COVID test result: 
positive. 

Having spent last year in New Haven doing online 
classes, living off campus, and getting tested in a 
standing coffin in the basement of my residential col­
lege twice a week, I had checked my MyChart test 
result at least forty times before. It had always been 
negative. Still, there were always familiar nerves 
when opening a new result, a fresh batch of internal 
questions and speculations about what would happen 
if it did, in fact, come back positive. How the fuck 
would I tell my roommates? Would I get taken away 
by a team of guys in hazmat suits and forced to live 
inside an insulated plastic bubble in isolation hous­
ing?  Would I have to talk to my dean?

Despite FAQ sheets on the Yale Health website 
outlining the need to stay home and follow the 
advice of your medical provider, it seemed like every 
story that I heard last year was different. Some peo­
ple moved to Old Campus isolation housing; some 
off-campus students rented Airbnbs so that their 
roommates would feel more safe. Some isolated for 
a full two weeks; others were released earlier. Some 
close contacts stayed locked in their rooms, while 
others felt confident enough to resume some sem­
blance of normal social life. The lingering question 
then, was whether or not each student determined 
the terms of their own isolation, or whether Yale told 
them exactly what to do.

When I opened my positive test result, all I wanted 
was for Yale to tell me exactly what to do. 

I am sitting on the edge of my bed, lacing up my 
boots and getting ready to head out to dinner with 
a group of friends. My phone vibrates in my lap 
and I think, yeah, I should probably check the result, 
just for some added peace of mind. Positive, typed in 
bold black lettering. Fuck. I had a mild cough for a 
few days, but I’d also been smoking all summer and 
just assumed it was one of those weeks. Don’t panic, 
I think to myself, someone is going to call and tell me 
what to do, and everything is going to be fine. I put a 
mask on and peer out through a crack in the door to 
look at one of my roommates, sitting at our kitchen 
table. “Helena,” I say. “I tested positive.” 
“OK, OK, don’t panic. What do we do?” she says, 
half getting out of her seat. “What did they say to 
do?” Nobody has called yet. There are no instruc­
tions, just the white rectangle on my phone screen 
with the result. After a year and a half of watching 
people get COVID, it actually happens and I have 
no fucking clue what to do. I Google “yale covid
