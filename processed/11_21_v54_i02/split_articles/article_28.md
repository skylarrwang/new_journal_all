O
n our walks to the riverbank, my father pre­
tends he is an expert commander. “Follow 
me,” he says, his feet maneuvering expertly 
over the tread marks where a tractor’s wheels have 
pressed into the earth, their weight leaving behind 
a narrow path of dried soil amid the mud. His right 
foot presses into the ground while the left one taps 
it briefly with every step, that semi-permanent 
limp from two-and-a-half decades of kneeling in 
front of strawberries with one foot in front of the 
other, always rushing to take the next step and fin­
ish the row. My little brother walks slowly behind 
him, careful not to crease his new pair of Jordans. 
I walk slowly, too, in a single file behind both of 
them, the toe of my Chuck Taylors digging into the 
places where the soil is still soft when I step. This past 
weekend’s rain, besides giving my father a few days 
off from work while the mud hardens, means that 
the Pájaro River might actually have water, and there 
might even be birds.

We cross the fence dividing our eighteen-unit 
apartment complex from the neighboring agricul­
tural fields through a jagged opening in the metal 
links that’s been there, unrepaired, for as long as I 
can remember. A ‘No Trespassing/ Private Property’ 
sign, with a small strawberry and the words ‘Reiter 
Berry Farms’ tucked in the corner, hangs above it. 
That, too, has been there, ignored, for as long as I 
can remember. “Okay, ‘manos,” my father says, 
“Duck down, we’re about to cross the border.” My 
little brother laughs and ducks behind a spot where 
overgrown grass clings to the fence, obscuring him­
self from the view of an imaginary border agent. 
My father likes to play this game because he thinks 
it makes our walks more interesting, makes it feel 
like there is some danger to what we’re doing, some 
rebellion, even though there isn’t. Most of the resi­
dents in our complex take walks through the fields, 
and the owners are probably aware. I don’t laugh 
when we play anymore; I find the game too morbid. 

We move through changing landscapes of pro­
duce. First, an acre of broccoli florets, just beginning 
to sprout. Then, a small apple orchard, dry and bar­
ren at this time of year. A solitary walnut tree. Blue­
berries and raspberries housed under white, gleam­
ing tarps. Strawberries, or at least hints of them, 
tiny pink bulbs that promise the start of the coming 
harvest season. And finally, the Pájaro River, tucked 
behind a row of wetland trees. 

My father turns to us, the lazy smile on his face 
revealing a missing incisor and chipped front tooth, 
and beckons us forward. “Por aquí, síganme. Walk 
straight forward, leave only one pair of footprints to 
throw off la migra. Otherwise, we’ll all have to run.” 
I want to tell him that it’s not funny, it’s really not 
funny, but I think it’s not my place. Instead, I roll my 
eyes and throw out an exasperated “Ay, apá” before 
taking my little brother’s hand and climbing down 
the path where my father’s feet have trampled the 
wild earth. When we reach the river, flowing with 
rain, my father points out how miraculous it is that 
we found water. He tells us to drink up. We’ll need 
to be hydrated for the rest of our journey. My little 
brother laughs and scrunches up his nose in disgust, 
remarking that river water is “so gross.” 

The stakes of this game aren’t lost on me; my 
brother and I are the only members of our family 
who were born on “this side” of things. Our entire 
lives have been sustained in and by these fields, these 
strawberries, this city filled with people from our 
could-have-been home, from elsewhere. We didn’t 
make the journey over, but inherited its promise. I 
wonder how much of his game is based in memory, 
how much in imagination. I wonder this because, 
despite my father’s desire to play-act migration with 
us, he’s never been one to divulge the specifics of his 
own journey. That’s why I don’t like to play along 
anymore: I can’t fill in the blanks. There is so much I 
don’t know, and I’m afraid that if I let myself interro­
gate his journey, my brain will conjure up some dark 
possibility I can’t disprove. Worse, I might stumble 
across something true, something painful, then wish 
I had never started turning over stones. The thought 
of it feels wrong, like picking at a scab on a wound 
that isn’t yours. Still, on our walks to the river, I look 
at my father’s face and can’t help but imagine him on 
a different journey, not smiling then, but dreaming.

My father’s journey started on a tiny sliver of 
land in the arid Valle de Guadalupe in Gomez Farías, 
Michoacán, in central México. The youngest son in 
a family of four sons and five daughters, he quickly 
learned to make himself useful and to stay out of 
the way. At age nine, he dropped out of elementary

We didn’t make the journey 
over, but inherited its promise.
