he white-throated sparrow, thousands of miles 
from northern Mexico where it began its spring 
migration, surveys New Haven from the air, 
flying over Prospect Street and then landing in a 
tree on Hillhouse. When it takes off, on track for 
its breeding ground in Canada, the sparrow, flying 
north at 20 miles per hour, slams directly into the 
glass windows of Evans Hall. It falls to the ground 
with a thunk.

On Sunday, September 25, Viveca Morris found 
and collected twelve dead birds from the ground 
outside Evans Hall, the center of the Yale School of 
Management. Wearing gloves, she carefully placed 
each bird in a Ziploc bag, along with a map marking 
where it had been found. “I really love birds,” said 
Morris. “It’s a little bit of a macabre hobby.” 

Morris visits Evans Hall several times a week to 
gather the birds that have died after colliding with 
its windows. She first noticed the problem when she 
was a student at SOM. Sitting in class, she and her 
classmates watched birds hit the iconic glass facade 
of Evans Hall and fall to the ground. In the winter, 
there might only be a few per week, but in the fall 
and spring, dead birds materialized almost every day. 

Although bird-window collisions are a common 
problem in cities, the architecture of Evans Hall is 
uniquely harmful to birds, thanks to the huge win­
dows wrapping around the building. An astounding 
2.25 million pounds of glass were used in its con­
struction. From one side of the building, the sky on 
the other side is visible through multiple layers of 
glass, which confuses the birds. A less obvious cul­
prit, however, is the abundant vegetation in the back 
of the building. At first glance, the secluded area, 
filled with perennial plants, seems to be a haven for 
wildlife, shielding them from humans and cars. But 
when birds flock there to feed and rest, they have 
trouble finding their way out. The glass facade looms 
over them, largely made invisible by the reflection 
of the trees and sky. As they try to leave, many head 
directly toward the reflection, where they collide 
with the window and die. 

From a young age, Morris loved animals, but she 
became increasingly invested in animal rights after 
learning about factory farming in high school. At 
Yale Law School, where she now works as an associ­
ate research scholar, Morris founded the Law Ethics 
and Animal Program (LEAP), a “think and do tank 
for animal protection,” as she calls it. In 2017, Morris 
began working on a report about Evans Hall that 
she would later publish in 2019. With the help of a 
few graduate students and Yale facilities personnel, 
Morris monitored the building daily and collected 
fallen birds. She delivered them to Kristof Zyskow­
ski, a scientist and collections manager at the Yale 
Peabody Museum, who then entered them into the 
University’s permanent collection. 

Zyskowski describes himself as a “systematizer.” 
“I’m really interested in assigning things to catego­
ries and finding patterns,” he says. Since 2017, over
