“I 
hope 
they 
hear 
me,” 
shouted 
former 
New 
Haven 
alderwoman 
and longtime Beinecke Library 
employee Dolores Colon ’91. 
She gestured behind her to the 
colonnaded façade of the new­
ly-renamed Schwarzman Center, 
where Yale President Peter Salovey 
was busy emceeing the kickoff of 
Yale’s seven billion dollar “For 
Humanity” 
capital 
campaign, 
the largest in its history. Colon’s 
voice, amplified by microphone, 
echoed across the intersection of 
Prospect and Grove: “It’s time for 
the leaders of Yale to respect their 
workers, and to respect their com­
munity.” The crowd—a two hun­
dred-strong mix of Yale workers, 
students, community organizers 
and local politicians—whooped 
and hollered. 

Colon was the penultimate 
speaker at the October 2nd event, 
a rally held by New Haven Rising, 
a community organization formed 
in the wake of the 2008 finan­
cial crisis to combat state budget 
austerity and the evaporation of 
good jobs. That the event over­
lapped with Yale’s capital cam­
paign kickoff was no coincidence. 
At the rally, attendees brandished 
signs with the question “What 
should Yale be for?”—a direct 
response to the administration’s 
email announcing the fundrais­
ing bonanza, which had asked its 
recipients, “What are you for?”  
The mood on Prospect Street, 
where upbeat music and danc­
ing alternated with remonstra­
tive chanting and searing jere­
miads, was by turns euphoric and 
indignant. For Locals 34 and 35 
UNITE HERE, the unions rep­
resenting the university cleri­
cal and technical (C&T) workers 
and service workers, respectively, 
there was much to celebrate. 
Earlier that week, Yale and the 
unions announced that they had 
reached a tentative agreement for 
five-year contracts that included 
unprecedented job security pro­
visions and created a pipeline that 
would give New Haven residents 
an additional forty jobs per year, 
half of which would be full-time 
positions with union wages and 
benefits.

The contracts, which were rat­
ified by both unions on October 
20th, capped an acrimonious six­
teen months of negotiations. At 
a New Haven Rising rally at the 
same intersection in early May, 
Local 35 Chief Steward and New 
Haven Board of Alders President 
Tyisha Walker-Myers had given 
the University a stern ultimatum: 
“Either [Yale] deliver[s] fair con­
tracts, or we’re gonna shut this 
city down.” Given the unions’ 
power on the Board of Alders—
since 2011, pro-labor candidates 
have dominated the city’s legis­
lative body—this was no empty 
threat.

Yet many of the speakers that 
October 
afternoon 
painted 
a 
darker portrait of the state of the 
city, still reeling from the effects 
of the pandemic, where a quarter 
of residents live below the pov­
erty line and one in three adults 
in its lowest income neighbor­
hoods routinely goes hungry. 
Nearly every speech connected 
New Haven’s chronically under­
funded schools and threadbare 
social services to the $157 million 
tax break New Haven bestows 
upon the University and Yale 
New Haven Hospital. Many also 
castigated Yale for failing to ful­
fill its 2015 agreement to hire a 
thousand New Haven residents 
into full-time, permanent jobs, 
with half of those hired coming 
from “neighborhoods of need.” 
The deadline for that hiring com­
mitment—which Yale agreed to 
only after city organizers held its 
feet to the fire—came and went in 
April 2019. While Yale says that it 
fulfilled its promises, New Haven 
Rising organizers argue that the 
university intentionally inflated 
its job numbers by including 
temporary postdoctoral associ­
ates and journeyman construction 
workers. “We need better hiring 
opportunities right now,” Remidy 
Shareef, an organizer with Ice the 
Beef, a local youth organization 
working to stop gun violence, 
told the crowd. “If Yale treats the 
community with this little regard, 
how do donors believe that a 
donation to Yale is a donation to 
humanity?” Shareef said, referenc­
ing the title of Yale’s capital cam­
paign. Yale, speaker after speaker 
insisted, needed to step up. 

Colon echoed these arguments 
at the October rally, but she had 
also come to Prospect and Grove 
to raise a more specific issue. In 
2019, 
Beinecke 
administrators 
had initiated a plan to start sub­
contracting some of the library’s 
cataloguing and processing work 
instead of hiring union employees 
to do it, she told the crowd. “Our 
collections are being loaded onto 
trucks and being shipped to Penn­
sylvania, where they are being 
processed by workers hired for as
