THE  NEW  JOURNAL
Knock knock. A winter chill leaks through the win­
dow of her Berkeley single, and she tightens her 
blanket burrito like a tourniquet. Instinctively, she 
reaches for Fat Louie, her black and white “cow” cat 
(who doubles as a portable furnace). He isn’t on the 
bed. She turns over. Through sleep-bleared eyes, she 
sees Louie sitting at the foot of her bedroom door, 
expecting company. 
“Facilities!” shouts a gruff voice from the hallway. 
She leaps to her feet. She hears the hand on the 
knob, the key in the lock. Almost out of time. She 
tries to shepherd Fat Louie into his carrier. He refuses 
to go in. What to do...
“Ah—don’t come in! I’m in bed!”
The hand falters, then extracts its key. The inspec­
tor shuffles away to screen another room. This 
Berkeley senior lives to cohabit with her secret pet 
for another day. 

As it turns out, she isn’t the only one hiding pets 
on campus. A clandestine menagerie exists behind 
the suite doors of Yale’s fourteen residential colleges, 
even though it violates the University’s housing reg­
ulations: “Pets are not permitted in Yale Housing.” 
Rulebreakers may be punished with “termination of 
the housing agreement.”
My pet-owning sources were not alarmed when 
I reminded them of this rule. They shouldered their 
violations willingly, almost nonchalantly. “There 
wasn’t really much ‘hiding’ to do,” admitted the 
Berkeley cat concealer. “No questionable encoun­
ters,” said the Hopper hedgehog smuggler. “We just 
put him in the closet sometimes,” claimed my fish-fa­
voring Trumbullian neighbors. 

The day-to-day duties of the secret pet owners on 
Yale’s campus are at once a burden and a gift. Feed­
ing, bathing, and exercising can be chores or wel­
come reprieves. 

One Hopper senior, who had received a hedgehog 
as a surprise birthday present during the pandemic, 
admitted, “she’s a double-edged sword.” The owner 
and her suitemates were unable to use their shared 
bathroom for her weekly baths, so they made do with 
a halloween candy bowl. The hedgehog was also 
an avid explorer, often escaping her cage to eat the 
grime under the couch and scamper down the hall­
way beyond the common room. “Hedgehogs move 
surprisingly fast!” the Hopper source said, “and they 
poop A LOT. She would often poop on my blan­
kets.”

On tough days, however, the chaos could be com­
forting. The hedgehog was a “constant presence” for 
her owner. Prickles and flightiness aside, hedgehogs 
don’t hold grudges. And when application season 
gets overwhelming, it’s important to have someone 
to hold. 

Fat Louie, too, became a pillar of his owner’s com­
munity during the pandemic. Last spring, she ran into 
a classmate sitting on the steps of Sterling, about to 
burst into tears. Instinctively, she invited her over to 
visit Fat Louie. “Even though she claimed she ‘wasn’t 
really a cat person,’ she ended up not wanting to 
leave,” the owner shared. The visitor wouldn’t let the 
cat go, petting the pain away. “She stayed through 
breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and definitely left as a 
cat person.” 

Go ahead, Yale. 
Try to take my 
hedgehog away.

Yale prohibits pets in dorms, but that 
hasn’t stopped some students.

According to my freshman-year neighbors in 
Bingham, Marvin the goldfish was a welcome dis­
traction from the academic grind. The suitemates 
described cleaning Marvin’s bowl as “a grounding 
ritual,” and “a good part of Yale.” The bowl was a 
one-gallon bear-shaped animal cracker jar, housing 
a flea-market statuette of a Grecian Madonna and 
a floor of blue rocks. Marvin was a bright spot in 
Bingham. His owners characterized their fish as an 
“instant celebrity,” drawing an “endless rotating cast 
of friends.”

The Pandemic Exodus of March 2020 displaced 
Marvin from his beloved Yale. He ended up hitch­
ing a ride to Manhattan on Metro North in a water 
bottle. His new home: a mason jar on the kitchen 
counter. He survived the turbulent journey, but the 
worst was yet to come. On March 15th, Dean Chun 
announced that Yale College students would not be 
returning to campus for the remainder of the aca­
demic year; that morning, Marvin’s owner walked 
into the kitchen and found him dead.

I, too, have experienced the joy of pet cohabita­
tion at Yale. Last Saturday, I was supposed to go to 
a party, but I’d had a rough, unproductive day. I was 
suffering from the kind of high-pressure headache 
that only comes after staring at screens, avoiding 
sunlight, and eating junk food all day. I wasn’t in the 
mood to do anything. 

But then my roommate texted: “My friend is insane 
and she wants to bring a dog to the apartment. Could 
you look after him tonight?”

Little did she know, she’d fixed my whole day. 
Archie the Ginger Doodle waddled around my room, 
a melon-sized bundle of red, bouncy curls, two end­
lessly surprised eyes, and a little wet nose. He con­
templated his reflection in the mirror, sniffed my tea, 
embraced my upset tummy, and sat on my lap while I 
worked through the night. I FaceTimed some friends 
I hadn’t talked to in a while to show them how well 
Archie matched my furniture. Starved for physical 
touch in a pandemic world, I cuddled him all eve­
ning. 

My day as Archie’s stand-in-owner reminded me 
of the pet contact I’ve been missing from home. 
Ollie, my oversized goldendoodle, is a snuggler. The 
pandemic was heaven to him—he had his whole pack 
under one roof, five people to loop around like a furry 
snake. When I squeezed between my two younger 
sisters to watch TV each night, Ollie lay over us like 
a weighted, heated blanket. 

Yale, in contrast, feels like an open expanse, filled 
with the freedom and individualism I craved while 
locked inside. But it’s easy to forget how lonely lib­
erty can be. Living off-campus without a meal plan, 
I’m hard-pressed to even get a visitor. Hugs, kisses, 
and cuddles? My tally is alarmingly low. And when 
the deadlines start to stack up and sleep becomes a 
rarity, physical contact is a lifeline. 

These animals seem to make life at Yale a whole 
lot easier. “Most definitely, he improved my expe­
rience 1,000%,” said the Berkeley senior and owner 
of Fat Louie. Marvin’s shepherds cited his constancy 
as a contributor to their sense of home at Yale. The 
Hopper hedgehog handler said the same about her 
pet. Has our year at home, disconnected from Yale 
and forced to rely on our pets and family, taught us 
something essential about what we need to feel like 
real people, especially in crisis? For these Yalies, the 
answer is “yes,” and they’ve taken matters into their 
own hands.
