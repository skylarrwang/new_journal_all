I
’m sentimental. I like to collect things. I 
take shells from the beach. I have every 
bus pass from high school saved, their 
weary magnetic stripes and all. As a first-se­
mester senior, my daily excursions into New 
Haven are constantly intruded upon by the 
emerging nostalgia I feel for places I am on the 
cusp of leaving. Once annoyed by the weekly 
email advertising Brick Oven’s Sunday Special 
in searing and enlarged Helvetica, I recently 
felt a wave of panic that I had yet to try their 
fifty percent off Large One-Topping Pizza. 
My time is running out. What about apple 
picking? A trip to Lighthouse Point? Or, sex 
in the stacks?

Having sex in the stacks of Sterling Memo­
rial Library has long been a canonical bucket 
list item for Yalies, an “almost mythical” albeit 
“known” thing Yalies do, according to Jasper*, 
a senior who was recommended the excursion 
during their first year. The opportunity pre­
sented itself spontaneously during a Grindr 
date, and Jasper thought, “Why not do it?” 
For Calvin*, a graduate from the class of 
2018, the experience was diligently pre-
planned. Calvin visited the library in the days 
before to get a sense of which floors were less 
frequented, and decided on a time when most 
other students were attending classes. “My 
partner and I wanted to experiment with pub­
lic sex, and the stacks seemed like the most 
obvious choice.” 

Of course, sex in the library is not an expe­
rience exclusive to Yale by any means. Yale, 
however, does have a particularly rich history 
around the public exploration of sexuality. 
Throughout the nineteen seventies, the Yale 
Law School Film Society screened porn reg­
ularly out of  lecture halls in the Sterling Law 
Building. Porn n’ Chicken, a club formed in 
1999 that gathered once a week to eat Popeyes 
and watch porn together, garnered significant 
media attention when the group began post­
ing flyers around campus soliciting auditions 
for The StaXXX, a pornographic film starring 
Yale students. Shortly after, club members 
alleged that filming was underway. 

After the club was profiled in the New Yorker 
and Time magazine, the status of the film was 
called into question. James Ponsoldt ’01, one 
of Porn n’ Chicken’s founders, claimed in the 
article “Porn n’ Chicken,” published in the 
Yale Daily News in 2002, that footage for the 
film had been shot in Sterling, but the scenes 
were ultimately destroyed after one of the par­
ticipants withdrew from the project. The film 
never came to fruition, though Ponsoldt sold 
the rights to the story to Comedy Central the 
year following his graduation in 2002. 

That same year, the first Sex Week was 
organized by Eric Rubenstein ’04 and Jacque­
line Farber ’03 with the intention of encourag­
ing conversations around sexuality on campus. 
Rubenstein and Farber recruited ​a range of 
speakers for a series of panels on sex and inti­
macy, including clergy members, academics, 
sex therapists, and adult film stars. In 2011, the 
Yale administration denied use of Yale’s name, 
campus resources, and corporate sponsorship 
for Sex Week, after facing criticism from stu­

dent groups and faculty. In the years since, Sex 
Week has resurfaced periodically, but without 
the same vigor and support as when Trojan was 
a corporate sponsor. Other campus organizing 
around sex has become more covert; current 
Yale students may be added to the orgy pan­
list, via which an anonymous group of students 
coordinates orgies throughout the year. 

What, then, about the stacks makes it a sta­
ple location for Yalies’ sexual escapades? The 
appeal is in part linked to the prestige, serious­
ness, and modesty of Sterling, and the comi­
cal intrusion of sex into that space. Modeled 
as an “ecclesiastical metaphor” in the words 
of architectural historian Margaret M. Gru­
biak, the space is fitted with a vaulted nave, 
stained glass, and an altarpiece mural greet­
ing every student as they venture into the 
stacks. The stacks themselves are of course 
less ornate: rows of library-bound books in 
uniform demure shades, patches of stippled 
light and dark, and a general cold aura from 
the white brick and tawny shelving. “Would 
I? Definitely,” one anonymous student wrote. 
“Maybe it’s the English major in me, but doing 
something illicit in a hallowed space of schol­
arship is pretty hot. To be fair though, Starr 
would be much more picturesque.”

The experience is not just alluring because it 
is illicit. It’s also democratic. 

“I feel like sex in the stacks definitely ranks 
among the top three most hyped sexualized 
(or at least nude) experiences on campus, 
along with naked parties and the orgy email 
list,” Calvin wrote to me.  “It is a bit unique, 
though, in that it doesn't require knowing a 
particular person to get invited like the other 
two. Thus, it's certainly the most accessible, 
and also the most private (assuming you don't 
get caught!).”

Reviews on the quality of the experience are 
varied. For Jasper, the novelty of the experi­
ence exceeded the quality of the sex itself. Still, 
they are glad to have had the opportunity, and 
they find the tradition amusing, having “seen 
some things” during their campus job in the 
library. “It is definitely full circle.” They paused 
to laugh. “From participant to spectator…I’m 
a voyeur!” 

Speaking to Jasper made me wonder where I 
fell in the cycle. Would I be content to gradu­
ate without partaking? Likely not. The candor, 
humor, and sentimentality with which students 
spoke of their sexual experiences exemplified 
some of the best qualities of Yale’s sexual cul­
ture. According to Jasper, it’s part and par­
cel of Yale as a generally “very sex-centered, 
sex-positive place,” which is perhaps why this 
aspect of the Yale experience persists in the 
student body’s cultural memory. It would be a 
shame, I realized, to graduate without my own 
excursion among the carrels and the rows of 
deserted carts, to leave the fluorescent lights 
buzzing over nothing but dust and cellulose 
rot.
