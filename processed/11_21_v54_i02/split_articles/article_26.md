**Title: WHEN A VIRUS CALLS**

“It’s calling from inside the house.”
Tonight is my turn to use the kitchen, so I’ve got 
the place to myself. No one else is allowed in. I could 
strip naked if I liked, pick my nose, smoke—whatever 
people do when they know they won’t be seen. But 
instead I’m standing at the sink, doing the dishes. It’s 
six o’clock in the evening, and I’m wearing a mask. 
It’s an N95, white and surgical, the kind that makes 
you feel like your mouth has gone camping in a tent. 
My mom knows someone who knows someone who 
works at the hospital, and they had some extras in 
storage. It’s much better than those awful cloth masks 
that irritate my skin and cause fat-tomato pimples to 
ripen on the tip of my nose—good thing no one will 
get a chance to notice them. The only people I see 
anyway are the man at the deli who smears cream 
cheese on my bagel, and the guy with the lip ring 
who sells me weed from the front seat of his beat-up 
Toyota. And as long as I wear my N95, I’m protected 
from their stares.
The sky is bruised purple and black. The tree in our 
backyard clutches its last leaves. It’s early November, 
and, despite the chill, I’ve thrown open all the windows 
in the kitchen and the living room. The house is 
hushed, like places that are empty but shouldn’t be—a 
deserted football stadium, or a classroom after school 
has closed. The wide, pink tiles are cold beneath my 
feet. My kitchen feels like a morgue. 
Upstairs my mom has started coughing again; 
she’s been at it all day. Coughing is okay, so long as 
her lips don’t turn blue. As I watch the water gurgle 
through a damp plug of food in the drain, I meditate 
on some numbers. 237,000, as of today—that 
number’s big, too big to really worry about. 2 percent—a 
shittier number, 1/50. I don’t want to think 
about it for too long. I remind myself that the 2 percent 
includes seniors, really old people, people with 
acrylic teeth and titanium knees. But how far away 
is my mom from them, really? She’s 55—ten years 
from 65, twenty years from 75. Back in May, when 
The New York Times published a list of the dead on 
the front page, the very first person was 57 years old. 
I know of someone who died at 54, the mother of a 
friend from high school. A single cough strikes overhead 
like a clap of thunder. 
I stuff my ears with headphones and crank the 
music real high, until it’s the only thing I can hear. 
For a moment I feel more cheerful, but then I realize 
I’ve been singing out loud, and I quickly shut it 
off. I shouldn’t be opening my mouth at all, let alone 
singing—spraying invisible droplets across the shared 
eating space like shrapnel shells. This is how the virus 
spreads: through an accidental laugh, through tears
