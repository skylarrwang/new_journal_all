**Title: AFTER THE SURPRISE PARTY**
**Author: ELENA UNGER**
**Page number(s): 33**

How does one capture the feeling
of being made to feel 
like a moon—cratered and whole,
a silvered face, catching 
and returning lemon-laced sun.
It’s a gift to know your light 
reaches the soil. A gift to see 
the imprint of your touch. 
I felt the way you all felt me
when I saw you assembled 
like a fated family.
Each of you standing in the 
dark of my dorm, 
woven between strands
of love hung streamers. 


**Title: MY BEST FRIEND LIKES TO SLEEP IN THE DARK**

She wraps a t-shirt around her eyes
and the budding moon wanes 
to a yawning black—
a personal eclipse of sorts.
To her, even the smallest sliver 
of light is too tempting. 
The mere prospect of day
will excite her to life 
before she has a moment to rest.   
The murmur of starlight
and the cluck of the sun 
make her so hungry 
to change the world,
she can’t bear to lie still.
