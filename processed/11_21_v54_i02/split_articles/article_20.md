EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
On its community, then hire us. 
Hire people from New Haven. 
Be a better neighbor. There’s a 
real opportunity here, not just to 
push for respect for people who 
are already Yale employees, but 
for the entire community as well.” 


Toward the end of their gener­
ally glowing appraisal of the 1984 
strike, the authors of On Strike 
for Respect offered a single reser­
vation: the strikers, they argued, 
hadn’t generally made a major 
issue of “Yale’s dominant position 
in the city of New Haven—and 
the contrast between the Univer­
sity’s wealth and the city’s pov­
erty.” They warned that failing 
to do so in the future courted the 
possibility “that unions within 
universities can become as insular 
as the institutions in which they 
organize.” 

Yale’s dominance over New 
Haven was a central theme of 
the October 2nd rally, but at no 
point was it more poignantly 
rendered than in the afternoon’s 
final speech. After Colon finished 
speaking, she handed the micro­
phone to Davarian Baldwin, a cul­
tural critic and professor at Trinity 
College whose most recent book, 
In the Shadow of the Ivory Tower: 
How Universities Are Plundering 
Our Cities, had exposed what labor 
economist Gordon Lafer once 
called the “tension between the 
enlightened promise and self-in­
terested practice of urban univer­
sities.” Sporting a black tracksuit, 
black sneakers, and tinted Ray 
Bans, Baldwin paced back and 
forth across Prospect Street, his 
thundering voice rising above 
early-fall gusts of wind. “When I 
want to make people understand 
higher education’s growing con­
trol over the economic develop­
ment and the urban governance 
of our cities and towns,” Baldwin 
boomed, “there’s no better place 
to talk about than Yale and New 
Haven. This is ground zero.” 

But Baldwin considers Yale 
and New Haven “ground zero” 
not only because of the problems 
it so acutely represents, but also 
because of the forms of resistance 
that have emerged in response to 
them. From the 2001 founding 
of the Connecticut Center for a 
New Economy (which became 
New Haven Rising in 2012), to 
the unions’ 2011 takeover of the 
Board of Alders, to the recent 
pushes for local hiring and for 
Yale to pay local taxes, the move­
ments that have developed over 
the past several decades show how 
“intimately connected” the rela­
tionship between labor and the 
community has become in New 
Haven, Baldwin told me a week 
after his speech. Looking back 
over the past four decades, the 
fears of the authors of On Strike for 
Respect never materialized; indeed, 
the opposite has largely been true. 

That library workers demanding 
an end to subcontracting are mak­
ing common cause with grassroots 
social movements pushing the 
university to fundamentally trans­
form its relationship with the city 
is evidence of how far things have 
come.

Three-and-a-half weeks after 
the rally, at noon on a rainy Tues­
day, a group of several dozen Local 
34 members marched into the cav­
ernous lobby of the Provost’s office 
at 2 Whitney Avenue. They were 
there to present the Provost —who 
had initiated the subcontracting 
project in early 2019—with a book 
filled with nearly 150 photographs 
of Local 34 members. In every 
photograph, a worker held a sign 
calling on Yale to “Respect Our 
Work!”, with each sign includ­
ing a personalized note explaining 
why they opposed subcontracting. 
“Good paying jobs with real ben­
efits should stay in New Haven, 
which improves the local econ­
omy and lifts people out of pov­
erty,” read one sign. “Everyone 
should have union representation. 
Worker rights are human rights,” 
read another. 

In response to Local 34’s photo 
petition, Yale University Librarian 
Barbara Rockenbach said that the 
library is “contractually obligated 
to the companies doing this work, 
and we continue to believe this is 
the most effective solution for a 
time-sensitive, short-term need.” 
Rockenbach added that the library 
remains “committed to maintain­
ing and supporting robust clerical 
and technical employment at the 
library and to advancing and sup­
porting, wherever we can, Yale’s 
commitments to the New Haven 
community.” 

While it is unclear how the 
library and university administra­
tion will ultimately respond to the 
petition’s demand for the library 
to commit to ending subcontract­
ing, what is certainly clear is that, 
as in 1984, the library workers’ 
struggle is intimately related to 
deeper contestation over what the 
university is, and what it should 
become.

“Especially for people in the 
administration that I speak to, 
their first thought is that people 
like me and people who are activ­
ists hate the university, that we’re 
anti-university,” Baldwin told me. 
“Nothing could be further from 
the truth. The point is that if we 
take the charters of universities, 
their mission statements, the lofty 
claims of their capital campaigns, 
and the general presumption that 
universities’ job is to solve the 
most difficult problems that face 
the globe to their logical conclu­
sion, why wouldn’t universities 
solve the problems in their own 
backyard, especially if they’re 
involved in creating those prob­
lems?” 

Prostano 
offered 
a 
similar 
sentiment, reminding me that, 
 ...[T]he library workers’ 
struggle is intimately related 
to deeper contestation over 
what the university is, and 
what it should become.

engraved on the façade of Ster­
ling Memorial Library is the 
phrase, “The Library is the heart 
of the University.” She and her 
colleagues want Yale to live up 
to that vaunted claim. They care 
about the university, just as they 
care about the city it calls home. 
For the Local 34 members push­
ing for more local hiring and an 
end to subcontracting, the goal 
isn’t to snuff out Yale’s heartbeat, 
but rather to make it thump to a 
tune that can appeal to everyone 
who lives and works under Yale’s 
ever-lengthening shadow.
