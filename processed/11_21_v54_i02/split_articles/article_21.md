I’ve been crying in the L-Dub showers. This is where I came to 
mourn my first graded problem set, to admit that college guys 
aren’t interested in committed relationships, and to meditate 
on how chicken breast doused in pepper will be my entire diet 
for the next four years. The four-by-four-foot confines offer a 
rare moment of privacy, inviting emotional vulnerability like 
that boy on the first night of orientation couldn’t. The shower 
also offers a quick disposal of evidence––no tissues flooding the 
floor, no mascara crystallizing along the rims of your eyelids. 
And because Yale Facilities still hasn’t called me back about 
my high-water-pressure complaint, the pounding of droplets 
against the moldy granite floor provides a built-in white noise 
for my sniffles and occasional wails. I’m bathing in (and invol­
untarily sipping) a cocktail of shower water, my own tears, and a 
little bit of Coconut Vanilla 2-in-1 hair product. What could be 
more cathartic?
