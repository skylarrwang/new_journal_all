and yawns. Through the lyrics of a Frank Ocean 
song, sung with abandon. 
My dad got it first, a single line of bold text on 
a piece of paper: POSITIVE. So he isolated in his 
room and my mom slept on a cot in the guest room, 
jamming a thermometer in her mouth over and over 
until the digits took up the whole screen. Then I 
started to feel unsteady, flattened, like an elephant 
had sat on me in the night. So I got shut away too. 
My brother went to sleep in my sister’s room, the 
two of them in one bed. We divided up the day into 
shifts: thirty minutes apiece for the kitchen—break­
fast, lunch, and dinner. Disinfect the bathroom after 
every use. Don’t linger in hallways. Wear a mask in 
communal spaces. 

It felt like a betrayal, a breach of the unspoken 
arrangement we’d made with the virus. The streets 
are yours, we conceded, but the home is sacred: our 
last and safest haven. But the virus reneged on the 
deal. The invisible assailants had slipped through the 
gates of Troy, hiding in my dad’s nasal passage. This 
was a forced entry, a home invasion—“Jill, we’ve 
traced the call. It's coming from inside the house!” 
Yesterday I woke up to find a piece of paper slipped 
under my door. It was a picture of my mom, her hair 
tucked in a bun and held together with a thermom­
eter. She was smiling and giving a thumbs-up to the 
camera; in the background, her cot was a mess of 
rumpled sheets, used tissues and cough drops. Below 
the picture she’d written: Feeling pretty good today! 
I think I might take a walk around the room, get some 
exercise. 7/10. Later I heard her footsteps outside, 
and another slip of paper came under the door. The 
walk was a bad idea. Now I’m dizzy and my stomach 
hurts. 3/10. The next day the notes stopped coming. 
I ripped out a piece of notebook paper and jotted 
down: How’s your stomach? She responded with a 
text. Don’t worry about me, doing fine! 

The dishes are done, the counters disinfected. 
I head upstairs to my room and flop down on my 
bed. I’m suffering from a symptom of the virus that 
doesn’t appear on the WebMD page: skin-hunger. 
I haven’t seen another person in six days. I haven’t 
touched anyone in much longer, probably weeks. 
I’m starting to learn that our muscles need touch the 
way they need protein. 

My stomach gives a lurch of hunger. Nothing 
to do but wait for morning, when my turn for the 
kitchen comes around again.
