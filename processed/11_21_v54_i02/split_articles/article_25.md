I. 
One night, I became nocturnal. Not by choice, 
but from fear. At the time, I was a fearful man. 
I even feared the sun. The last time I saw the sun, it 
was red. Like a blood-shot eye. Look, I thought. The 
sun is angry at you. So I hid. I hid for two months. 
In hiding, I couldn’t always tell the difference 
between my slumber and my wakefulness. I didn’t 
dream. When I woke up, I didn’t think. Instead, I 
yearned. At the time, I did not know what or who 
I yearned for. I just knew I was incomplete. There 
existed an incompleteness so strong that I had to 
move. But the slightest motion felt violent. Am I a 
violent man? I asked myself. 
Then, in the blinding night, I walked. 
Those walking nights, I believed in destiny. I 
believed I could walk and end up in a promised land. 
For hours, I wandered to find some place distant, 
unfamiliar. Always, I ended up back at home. 
I don’t remember everything from my walks. My 
memory, like Sappho’s lyrics, became fragmented. 
Memory is oddly picky. It seems like yesterdays and 
mornings are always forgotten. But something curious 
is lodged in my mind. My mother, holding a pen, 
writing on a well-worn desk. Outside the window, a 
roaring beach. No—an interstate highway. Perhaps, 
my father’s cries, or are those my own tears? In the 
memory, am I young? When was this? Maybe long 
ago. Or not at all.

II.  
The walks were sometimes lonely but not 
always. One night, my friend called me. He 
lived across the country for school. It was late for me, 
later for him. There were many reasons to be up late 
on a Friday night. He didn’t tell me his own.

How are you?

I’m drunk, he said.

What was that noise?

I threw up.

At least it’s all out now.

Finally.
Before he left for school last year, he told me he was 
in love. Not with me. With someone who I thought 
undeserving of his love. I didn’t tell him this. Instead, 
I listened as he revealed his feelings for someone else. 
When he left, there were many things I wanted to tell 
him.

Sometimes, I feel so far away, he said.

From?

I don’t know. It’s just that feeling.


I threw up again.

It wasn’t all out?

Not yet.
He would later miss over half of his classes that year. 
He, too, would turn nocturnal. He would tell me that 
his behavior was stupid. All he had to do was get out 
of bed. For some reason, he would stay. He would 
describe its familiar mold, a mold that would hold 
him tight. He knew it was wrong to stay in bed. But 
strangely, it made him feel safe. 

I missed you, he said.

I missed you, too...Hello? Hello?
He went silent. He stayed silent for an hour. Perhaps he 
passed out. I imagined him, keeled over on a 
vomit-filled toilet. In place of his voice, his soft breath, 
and sometimes a snore. I did not turn the phone off. 
I walked along the dark streets with his soft breath 
in my ear. I walked until I found myself back in my 
bed. Then, I slept, just like he had been sleeping, miles 
away.
Later, he texted me. He said how sorry he was for 
calling me. I told him it was okay. I told him to be 
safe. I didn’t tell him that I wished he called me more 
often. I didn’t tell him that for the first time in months, 
I had not felt alone. 


III. 
I established a route. I would walk to a 
high school parking lot. Past the 7/11 gas 
station. Past a flattened cat or possum or raccoon. Past 
a dirtied blue mask. Past a used lush ice Puff Bar. Past 
the woods near the military base. Past the police station, 
I would find the water. There were no streetlights on the 
beach. When I walked into the water, 
the coldness burned me. Only the coldness told me 
where to go. Then, back home I walked.
Once, I peed behind the 7/11 gas station. When I 
walked around the corner, my eyes met the back of 
a woman. She walked out of the gas station onto the 
streets I thought I alone walked. I followed. Not out 
of curiosity. But out of necessity. The route was my 
ritual.
On the road outside of the beach, a man stood. The 
woman walked up to the man, tapped him on the 
head, and pulled out a roll. Together, they smoked. 
They didn’t speak. They stared out into the water. 
What did they look at? I stared into the water to find 
the black, a black darker than black. Like looking at a 
Rothko painting, I searched for meaning.
When I decided there was no meaning, I walked 
back home. The two still stood, looking into the black.

IV. 
One night, I decided I was tired of walking. 
So, I texted a man from a dating app to 
pick me up. I didn’t know what he looked like. Even 
when I entered his car in the obscure night, I couldn’t 
see his face. His voice, though, a deep bass, I heard.
When he asked me where I wanted to go, I told 
him near the water. On the way, he stopped by a Starbucks. 
Did I want anything? I asked for lemonade. He 
didn’t order anything for himself. 
By the water, we didn’t touch each other. Instead, 
we talked. What did he say? He lived on base, just 
out of training. Did he say he was last stationed in 
Texas or Idaho? He had a little sister. Maybe they 
were estranged. I can’t remember. A clear memory, 
though: his quivering voice, a lament, confessing that 
he had been hiding for twenty-five years, twenty-six 
soon. He hated it, and he didn’t hate many things. 
Bah! Who cares? Nobody. Why were we awake at 3 
AM, anyways?
The same reason you are.
In all honesty?
All honesty.
During the drive back, I fell asleep. Later, he 
touched me for the first time, gently, nudging my 
shoulder. We were back at my place. I said goodbye 
and shut his door. As soon as I did, the car sped away, 
as if embarrassed. That morning, he texted me again. 
I deleted the app soon after.
I have not seen him since. But, I remember his 
voice. If he had called out to me on the street today, I 
would recognize him. Though, what would he even 
say? I never told him my name. He never told me his.

V. 
And then there was light. I woke up one 
morning to find the sun. Where was I now? 
Still in my bed. The laughter of the neighbors’ children 
spilled into my room. I hadn’t heard them in 
months. Were they taller now than before?
As if my two months of nocturnal existence had 
not existed, I acclimated to the day. I went for runs, 
worked, talked to friends and family. During the 
summer, the sun shone on my skin every day. As 
soon as the dark came each evening, I closed my eyes. 
When I opened them, I would find the kind light 
again. 
Sometimes, I wondered if my nocturnal existence 
even existed. There were so many things I couldn’t 
remember. At night, I couldn’t see everything. The 
world seemed smaller. Though, on occasion, something 
indicated that the world was indeed large. A 
yowling cat, a speeding car, a shout, murmuring 
from behind a lit window, and if nothing else, the 
whir of the streetlights above.
Often the only thing clear to me was the streets, 
the streets I would walk on, the streets I knew. It was 
simpler that way. I knew exactly where my next step 
was going to land and where my next step would 
take me. Do I miss those times? I still do not know. 

VI. 
There are so many things I can’t remember. 
But the same memory is stuck in my 
head. I was young when my father cried. I laid underneath 
my mother’s desk. My mother’s leg shook. The 
scratching above me. What was my mother writing? I 
could see the cars just outside our window, the interstate, 
busy as ever. Even the closed window couldn’t 
hide its deafening roar. Where was my father? In all 
of this, where was he crying? And my mother, her 
voice, commanding, angry. After, I remember nothing. 
Perhaps, beneath the desk, I had closed my eyes. 
Perhaps I learned to darken a turbulent world. In this 
darkness, I learned how to escape.
