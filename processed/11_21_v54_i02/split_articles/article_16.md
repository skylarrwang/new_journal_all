300 birds have been collected. The majority now 
rest at the Environmental Science Center on Sachem 
Street. 

Morris delivers her Ziploc bags of birds in a cooler 
to the Environmental Science Center. Zyskowski 
then stores the birds in a larger cooler for a few days, 
next to various other found animals, before he or one 
of his research assistants has time to remove the inner 
carcass, preserving it separately from the outer skin 
and feathers. In death, the birds lose none of their 
color. Many have yellow or orange chest feathers 
that stand out against the grey filing cabinet. Laid 
on their back or on their side, their thin claws rest 
gently in the air. Preserved so artfully by Zyskowski 
and many others, it’s easy to forget the violence of 
their death. Not all birds make it into the permanent 
collection. Zyskowski described one bird whose head 
was consumed by ants after hitting the Yale Science 
Building, leaving just its skull behind. 

“Your little brown bird that’s normally seen as 
unremarkable…when you’re looking at it up close, 
it’s hard not to think that this is just an incredibly 
beautiful and remarkable animal,” Morris says. “What 
a shame to lose it, unnecessarily.”

Morris maintains regular contact with facilities 
staff at the Yale School of Management. In spring 
2021, facilities put up window film on one part of 
the back facade, per the recommendation in her 
report. These window films, a sort of half-transpar­
ent wallpaper with periodic opaque dots, are one of 
the most popular bird-friendly adaptations available 
to buildings. The opaque sections of the wallpaper 
are visible to most birds and signal to them that 
there’s a structure they need to avoid. Other solu­
tions include covering the whole building in a taut 
netting the birds can see, or replacing glass with 
some other material. Window films, however, are 
generally considered the most cost-effective and 
discreet option. 

According to Jill McSorley, director of facilities 
operations at the Yale School of Management, it 
would cost 500,000 dollars every ten years to cover 
the glass in these bird-deterring window treatments. 
The facilities team is in the process of ordering more 
sample decals for the back windows, but have no 
plans yet to cover the whole facade. 

On a Wednesday afternoon in September, Zys­
kowski walked up to the Yale Science Building to 
check on a bird he had noticed that morning. The 
bird had been lying still, near a bush, directly under 
a wide patch of glass. When he went back in the 
afternoon, however, the bird was gone. “Maybe it 
flew away,” he said. Sometimes that happens; the 
birds are momentarily stunned, and later able to get 
up and finish their migration. Most aren’t so lucky.
