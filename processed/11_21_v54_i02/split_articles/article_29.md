school to start helping out on the rancho. He and his 
siblings were dutiful in their work: pulling weeds, 
planting crops, milking cows, and making them­
selves busy to avoid my grandfather’s drunken rages. 
Once, he found my father screwing around in their 
driveway with a slingshot, and nearly ran him over 
with his truck. That memory is now a jagged pale 
scar protruding from the right side of my father’s 
forehead, always with him. Everything I know about 
my father’s childhood and adolescence comes to me 
like this—in scars and half-stories, missing all the 
hows and whys. 

What I do know is this: my father grew up sur­
rounded by people in a state of constant fear—and 
buried beneath, hope. He came of age in the after­
math of the Dirty War, the name given to the Mex­
ican theater of the Cold War, during which U.S.-
backed government forces disappeared an estimated 
1,200 of their own citizens due to suspected political 
opposition. The Institutional Revolutionary Party 
(PRI) was supported by CIA officers who served as 
station chiefs in México City as late as 1969, the year 
after tensions between the government and leftist 
guerrilla and student groups peaked at the Tlatelolco 
Massacre. On October 2, 1968, police officers and 
soldiers shot into a crowd of unarmed student pro­
testors, killing at least 300. My father was born four 
years after this massacre and six years before the 
legalization of left-wing political parties officially 
ended the Dirty War. 

Despite the government’s attempts to eradicate 
its rebels, México’s revolutionary spirit kept break­
ing ground, like a weed whose roots are planted 
firmly into the soil. Two decades after the end of 
the Dirty War, the newly-emerging leftist Zapatista 
National Liberation Army began organizing against 
the still-ruling PRI on a platform demanding land 
rights and political autonomy for Indigenous peo­
ple. In 1994, on the day NAFTA came into effect, 
dissolving the trade border between México and the 
United States, the Zapatistas declared war against the 
state with their battle cry: La tierra es del quien la tra­
baja. The Zapatistas demanded “work, land, housing, 
food, healthcare, education, independence, freedom, 
democracy, justice, and peace.” 

Like most people who grew up poor in third-
world conditions, my father understands that capital­
ism necessitates dispossession; the patrones need the 
laborers with the bodies to use and discard. When 
I think about this, I get the urge to lie down. My 
father keeps on instead. He buys bags of oranges 
from the trunks of street vendors’ cars to make their 
days a little shorter, and then gives a dollar and the 
ripest ones to his primos, the unhoused men who lin­
ger at the margins of our intersections with cups full 
of pennies and dimes. I’ve always believed that my 
father should have been a Zapatista—he is, in prac­
tice, the most radical person I know—but he wasn’t. 
Because he came of age as the families of victims of 
state violence demanded answers and accountability 
from the Mexican government, he knew it was safest 
not to get involved.

As the Zapatistas attempted to appeal to campesi­
nos’  ties to the land they cultivated, my father wit­
nessed the men in his village disappear to work in 
foreign lands. This was not a new phenomenon; 
every spring during his childhood, busloads of brace­
ros were picked up from the station in Morelia,  off to 
labor in the fields of California, Arizona, Texas, and 
New Mexico, and dropped off again in the fall. But 
now small towns all over México were emptying out. 
Once you left, you weren’t coming back. 

Up until the nineteen nineties, crossing the border 
both ways was relatively straightforward: you paid a 
coyote to smuggle you over, came back, rinsed and 
repeated. But with the ending of the bracero pro­
gram and the militarization of the southern border, 
deportation was becoming a new beast, and people 
who made it to the United States were incentivized 
to settle down there. No longer welcome on the land 
they’d been working for decades, the men of my 
father’s village figured out ways to get to the “other 
side” for a share of its promise, without the possi­
bility of return. Many of them found their way to 
California’s Central Valley, vying for a home around 
the fields where their fathers had labored as braceros 
before them. 

In 1997, my father married my mother in Gomez 
Farías, and later had his first daughter. With a fam­
ily to support, it quickly became clear that it was his 
turn to make the journey over. Two of his broth­
ers and three of his sisters had already migrated to 
a small town on the coast of Central California, a 
town whose name was whispered like a hand-me-
down promise in the villages of Michoacán. Watson­
ville: A promise of work, of money, of better, if not 
good. So, my father prepared to make the trek up 
to Tijuana, where he would pay a coyote to smug­
gle him through the urban crossing. Then he would 
hitch a ride from San Diego to Watsonville, where he 
would sleep on a mattress on the floor of his broth­
er’s apartment until he raised enough money to pay

for his wife and daughter’s journey north. It sounded 
simple enough, but my father knew it wasn’t. 

Over the last decade, as the United States milita­
rized its southern border, more and more stories of 
terrible things happening during people’s journeys 
north trickled down to my father’s village. The sto­
ries were repeated, exaggerated, made into myths. 
It’s a bit like my father’s game on our walks to the 
river: part reality and part imagination. Somebody 
got their organs scoped out in Jalisco, somebody got 
their legs stuck under a train’s wheels in Chiapas, 
somebody died of dehydration hidden under a seat in 
Sonora. Nobody really knew what happened on the 
journey north except those who made it out, but that 
didn’t stop people from guessing. 

What is true is this: since 1993, the United States 
government has benefitted from making the journey 
north more treacherous for migrants. After pass­
ing the North American Free Trade Agreement to 
make crossing the border easier for merchandise, 
President Bill Clinton made it harder for migrants. 
Stadium lights went up, shining into Tijuana. More 
armed Border Patrol agents and advanced surveil­
lance equipment turned the border region into a 
war zone. Thermal-imaging devices, motion detec­
tors, in-ground sensors, and biometric scanners 
were employed at urban border crossings to deter 
migrants. The goal was to force migrants to cross 
instead through the  South Texas flatlands or the 
Arizona desert, a longer, more dangerous journey 
under scorching heat. Clinton’s Immigration and 
Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meis­
sner claimed during the Immigration and Natural­
ization Service’s annual death-watch update that the 
“geography” of the southern border was an “ally” of 
the United States. 

According to the Border Patrol, just under 8,000 
migrants turned up dead in the desert between 1998 
and 2020. That’s one a day, pretty much every day, 
for the last twenty years. I feel lucky that none of 
them were my father. But I feel devastatingly sad 
when I think about the number 8,000, and all the 
others who may never be found, their bodies stuck 
between home and their destination, never fulfilling 
the promise of arrival.

I’ve never been to Gomez Farías, but I see it in my 
dreams. I close my eyes and enter dusty valleys, walk 
down sepia-tinted dirt roads, look up at ripe-green 
avocados clustered on trees angled towards the sun. 
Some of what I see is real—a replica of the landscape 
that is burnt onto my retinas from spending hours on 
Google Earth, dropping the little explorer into every 
street of my father’s town, making him take the walks 
my father took—from my father’s cotton-candy pink 
terracotta home to the kindergarten near San Antonio 
Ocampo where he learned to count. Mostly, though, 
the dreams are superimposed on the terrains of my 
own hometown, on the landscapes where I strut in 
my Chucks and Zara jeans, where I steal blueberries 
from vines and stare at an empty riverbed. I know

it’s México only because even in my dreams I feel 
foreign there. 

In my favorite dream, I wake up in a bed that looks 
like mine but isn’t, a bed inside that pink house that 
could have been mine if times had been different, 
and to a rooster crowing outside my window. I drag 
myself out of bed with leaden legs, and the convic­
tion of someone who knows she’s got shit to do. I 
walk into a living room that looks like the one at my 
grandmother’s house in Watsonville, and my father 
is cutting fruit into tiny pieces. He smiles but doesn’t 
speak; I sit at the kitchen table and look out the win­
dow toward dry flatlands that never stay flat for long. 
Before my eyes, the landscape morphs, pixelates like 
the images on Google Earth do when I make the lit­
tle explorer walk, and hills pop up out of the ground 
like unwanted zits. This part of the dream makes me 
anxious, although I’m not sure why. Once the curves 
of Mount Madonna and the California skyline appear 
outside the window, the landscape doesn’t go flat 
again. Then my dream is over, and when I wake up, 
I’m back in my own bed, in my own house, in this 
town that has always been mine.  

I’m grateful that my roots are deeply planted in a 
place from which I can’t be taken, that my body won’t 
have to risk its survival to cross any border, but I still 
feel like there’s something crucial that I’m missing; 
like the gap between my father and me is unbreach­
able, spanning across miles of terrain and through the 
years between us, like I’ll never see the world the way 
he does. My father is all make-do and make-believe 
and make-the-best-of-a-bad-situation. I’ve inher­
ited his dream of success and safety, of growing roots 
into this new land of promise, but all of these ideals 
look different to me. I want to make-better. I want to 
make-move and make-shake and make-the-whole-
system-burn-goddammit! I don’t think this differ­
ence is inherent to us; I think it’s all circumstantial, 
tied to the landscapes on which we are planted and 
watered. These borders are not real, but the possibili­
ties that separate them are, the ones that make people 
cross through miles of arid desert without water or 
protection for a taste of what’s on the other side. 

My father’s eyes are hard and warm; he is easy to 
love, but harder to understand. He offers love to me 
in bowls of chopped papaya, triangle shaped straw­
berries, jicama cut into little strips, raspberries stolen 
from the fields we call a backyard. He is anxious and 
overprotective, says things like “ten cuidado, be care­
ful; be home before dark; don’t get involved, don’t 
fight back, just follow directions; don’t forget to 
look under your car for assaulters before you get in 
so nobody slices your ankles; te quiero mucho, mija.” 
As his daughter, a girl who just wants to experience 
a world that’s mostly been kind to her, it’s kind of 
annoying. As his daughter, a girl who sees herself as 
an extension of his dreams, his journey, it’s devastat­
ing. I can only reply, “Okay, okay, I’ll try, okay, yo 
también lo quiero, apá.” He has been through a lot. I 
can tell by the way he moves, slow and calculated, 
always wanting to know where his foot will land 
before taking his next step. 

I have been through a lot, too, if measured in a 
different pitcher. When I walk, I am not ladylike, 
and rarely graceful, but I am nervous like him. I 
let the heel of my shoes hit the ground first. I don’t 
make noise; I don’t want to leave a trace. In Novem­
ber of 2016, when I was a junior in high school, I 
told my father I was heading to the ‘Not Our Pres­
ident’ demonstration in Oakland, and he told me I 
would never see him again. I rolled my eyes, said 
“apá, it’s my right” without considering that, in his 
world, it wasn’t. In his world, university student pro­
testors were shot by soldiers in broad daylight and 
never came home. I get it now, mostly, because it’s 
my world, too. I inhabit it through the fragments of 
him I can grasp, through the history I’ve imposed 
onto them in an attempt to make them whole, and 
through my own memories of seeing protestors on 
screens fall to the ground to the tune of rubber bul­
lets and tear gas and the National Guard filling our 
streets. Like a stained-glass window, the fragmented 
pieces of our experiences come together and tint my 
world a different color.
