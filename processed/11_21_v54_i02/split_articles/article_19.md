little as thirteen dollars and fifty 
cents,” Colon said, her last few 
words drowned out by boos and 
jeers. “I can’t believe it either,” she 
pressed on, shaking her head. “It’s 
a lot less than what Amazon ware­
house workers make per hour. It’s 
just shameful.”

In its recent history, Yale has 
been no stranger to subcontract­
ing, a labor practice in which a 
company hires an outside firm 
instead of directly employing 
workers itself. Yale’s insistence 
on its right to subcontract was the 
central issue of the 1996 contract 
negotiations, which culminated 
in two bitter monthlong strikes. 
In the midst of those negotia­
tions, American historian Robin 
D.G. Kelley wrote that univer­
sity subcontracting “has been part 
of a larger corporate strategy to 
reduce wages and benefits and to 
bring in casualized, temporary 
nonunion labor”—a strategy, he 
argued, which let “the adminis­
tration off the hook by rendering 
even more invisible the exploita­
tion of labor at the university.” A 
quarter-century later, Colon was 
there to make sure no one would 
look away.

“People in New Haven neigh­
borhoods know that if they do get 
a job here and get a foot in the 
door, they can have good benefits 
for their children and themselves,” 
she said. As a single mother with 
two young children, Colon was 
speaking from personal experi­
ence; she couldn’t make ends meet 
until she began working at Yale. 
“Instead of shipping jobs out of 
state, Yale should be honoring 
their commitments to hire from 
neighborhoods of need into good 
jobs,” she said. “Will they con­
tinue to spend millions on out-
of-state firms? Or will they invest 
money in their own community, 
here in New Haven?” 

—
The morning after the rally, I 
drove twenty minutes south of 
Yale to Ocean Avenue, a wind­
ing street that snakes along the 
beaches of West Haven’s coast­
line, between the mouths of Cove 
River to the north and Oyster 
River to the south. The houses on 
Ocean Avenue are two-story, sin­
gle-family dwellings with modest 
front yards and spectacular views 
of the Long Island Sound. I knew 
immediately which house I was 
looking for when I saw a flash of 
red on the door: a “Yale: Respect 
New Haven” sign, just like the 
ones that have dotted the campus 
and city for years. After knock­
ing on the door, careful to avoid 
disturbing the sign, I was ushered 
inside by my host.

Even if you had no idea what 
she does for a living, you could 
tell pretty quickly that Ame­
lia Prostano is a librarian, and an 
extremely fastidious one at that. 
Open on her kitchen table in 
anticipation of my arrival was a 
photo album, dozens of pages long 
and meticulously organized, cov­
ering Prostano’s nearly forty years 
as a member of Local 34 and an 
employee at the Beinecke, where 
she currently works as an acquisi­
tions assistant. While she fixed me 
a coffee, I flipped through page 
after page filled with photographs 
of picket lines, marches, rallies, 
and the odd busload of cops dis­
patched to intimidate striking 
workers. In her four decades at 
Yale, Prostano’s personal archive 
of Yale’s labor activity certainly 
hasn’t lacked material. “Union­
busting,” the New York Univer­
sity historian Kim Philips-Fein 
once wrote in The Nation, “is as 
much a Yale tradition as Lux et 
Veritas.” 

Prostano came to Yale in 1983, 
during the crucible of one of the 
fiercest anti-union campaigns in 
Yale’s history—and one of the 
most 
consequential 
moments 
of labor struggle in late twen­
tieth century U.S. history. In 
the decades before the nineteen 
eighties, national labor organiz­
ers had tried and failed multiple 
times to unionize Yale’s clerical 
and technical employees, a work­
force largely made up of female 
secretaries, librarians, and labo­
ratory technicians. In May 1983, 
following a three-year organiz­
ing drive spearheaded by the 
Hotel Employees and Restaurant 
Employees International Union 
(HERE), a slim majority of Yale’s 
2,600 C&T employees voted to 
unionize as Local 34. After a year 
of trying and failing to negotiate a 
contract with a hostile administra­
tion, the fledgling union went on 
strike in late September 1984. 
At a moment when the arche­
typal union worker in the Amer­
ican imagination was a white, 
male factory worker, Local 34’s 
campaign was notable for being 
avowedly feminist in both its 
makeup and its demands. Pros­
tano, who earned just $9600 
during her first year at the library, 
remembers a casual conversation 
just a few weeks into her job in 
which her supervisor commented 
on how nice it was that she had 
the chance to make “pin money.” 
An expression dating back to the 
seventeenth century, “pin money” 
denoted the allowance a man 
would give a woman to purchase 
clothing and other incidentals. “I 
thought to myself, I’m working a 
full-time job, and you’re telling me 
it’s nice to have pin money?” Pros­
tano told me. “But that’s where we 
were in 1983.”

Prostano was there in early 
October 1984, when nearly 200 
C&T 
workers 
were 
arrested 
during a silent protest in front of 
then-Yale President Bartlett Gia­
matti’s house. And she was there 
three weeks later, when civil rights 
leader Ralph Abernathy blessed 
the striking workers in a packed 
United Methodist Church on the 
New Haven Green before they 
went out to a protest in front of 
Woodbridge Hall. “Yale is a great 
institution. Yale is a wealthy insti­
tution. But Yale is treating certain 
segments of its population unjustly 
and Yale University ought to be 
ashamed,” Abernathy, one of the 
late Martin Luther King Jr.’s clos­
est friends and advisors, told the 
crowd. “You have the opportunity 
to witness for justice and equality. 
. . for a grand and noble cause.” 
“There was no way you could 
have stopped us in 1984,” Prostano 
told me. “It’s a feeling I can’t even 
explain. It was life-changing. It 
changed my life in so many ways.” 
The union emerged victorious 
from the strike, winning a contract 
that went a significant way toward 
eliminating the gender pay gap at 
Yale and provided benefits tailored 
to the needs of women workers. 
When Prostano lost her husband 
in 1995, it was only because of her 
union job and the raises she knew 
were coming that she was able to 
keep her house on Ocean Avenue, 
where, a quarter century later, she 
weathered the pandemic with her 
two young grandchildren.

The 1984 strike wasn’t just 
life-changing for Prostano. For 
many labor historians, it holds a 
special place in recent U.S. labor 
history. Local 34’s ability to win 
substantial concessions from the 
university was a rare bright spot 
for the U.S. labor movement in 
the nineteen eighties, which faced 
a presidential administration hell-
bent on union-busting and an 
economy hemorrhaging industrial 
jobs. (In New Haven, the vaunted 
Winchester Arms factory, once 
the largest employer in the city, 
shuttered its doors in 1977.)

The strikers also pioneered a 
social-movement 
style, 
demo­
cratic approach to labor organiz­
ing that has become a model for 
successful campaigns in recent 
years. Instead of centering their 
campaign around wages and ben­
efits, the 1984 strikers focused 
more on dignity and social jus­
tice, a strategy which gave them 
a broader base of support. Their 
aim was to expose the Yale admin­
istration’s hypocrisy and harm 
the University’s brand, its most 
important asset. In that sense, the 
strikers were acting with oracular 
foresight. “What Local 34 figured 
out in 1984 presaged our current 
moment in the economy, when 
attacking a companies’ brand is 
what you do to build power,” 
Jacob Remes ’02, a labor historian 
at NYU working on a book about 
the 1984 strike, told me. Through­
out the fall of 1984, union mem­
bers carried signs claiming that 
they were “On Strike for Respect,” 
a rhetorical flourish that echoes 
across four decades of New Haven 
labor history and reappears in the 
New Haven Rising slogan, “Yale: 
Respect New Haven.”

The strike and its most memo­
rable slogan even inspired its own 
book, On Strike for Respect, pub­
lished by three labor historians 
and one lawyer in 1995. While 
the book’s sales only reached a 
couple thousand, Prostano, true to 
her profession, has a good-as-new 
copy, which she kindly offered me 
later that afternoon on my way 
out the door.

But I hadn’t come to Prostano’s 
house just to talk history. And 
I wasn’t her only guest. A few 
minutes after I arrived, Jennifer 
Garcia and Cecillia Chu walked 
through the door—Prostano’s col­
leagues at the Beinecke and fellow 
members of Local 34, where Gar-

cia serves on the executive board. 
I was there to learn more about 
the library’s use of subcontracted 
rather than union labor, a problem 
which goes back years, as all three 
of them explained. 

Garcia 
was 
hired 
by 
the 
Beinecke as an archives assistant in 
May 2013. At the time, the library 
was in the midst of what it called 
the “Baseline Processing Project.” 
The initiative was a response to the 
growing mismatch between the 
library’s steadily-growing mass 
of acquired materials—a prod­
uct of its robust budget—and the 
amount of people it employed to 
do the cataloguing and archiving 
work necessary to make those 
materials accessible to teachers 
and researchers. As part of the 
project, two temporary employees 
had been hired to help Garcia and 
the other two archives assistants 
in the manuscript unit. Within 
two years, however, the two other 
permanent archives assistants had 
left the unit, and when the tempo­
rary positions expired, the library 
didn’t extend their duration or 
hire the workers into either of the 
two permanent positions that had 
opened up. 

“For the next two years, I was 
the only person providing sup­
port on the processing end of 
the department, which was a lot, 
and very difficult,” Garcia said, 
especially as the collections kept 
growing and the backlog problem 
remained unsolved. “Beinecke is 
really wonderful, and has robust 
budgets for developing its collec­
tions. But in many ways it’s been 
frustrating to see that the same 
emphasis they have on enhancing 
what we have in-house doesn’t 
seem to apply to the employees 
that work there.”

In late March 2019, Prostano 
and Garcia, who serve as union 
stewards in the department, were 
called into a meeting with the 
then-head of Beinecke Technical 
Services and one of Yale’s finan­
cial analysts, who matter-of-factly 
explained that the library—at the 
behest of the Provost—was plan­
ning on hiring subcontractors to 
help deal with the ongoing back­
log problem. Both Prostano and 
Garcia were completely blind-
sided by the news. Later, they 
discovered that the Beinecke had 
signed multi-year contracts with 
two companies: Backstage Library 
Works and the Winthrop Cor­
poration, based in Utah and New 
York, 
respectively 
(Backstage 
operates the Bethlehem, PA ware­
house that Colon mentioned in her 
October 2nd speech). The con­
tracts were each worth millions 
of dollars. “I was shocked,” Pros­
tano said. When union members 
dug through Backstage’s website, 
they discovered that it was adver­
tising processing positions for half 
of what a Local 34 worker would 
normally make. 

Once 
Prostano 
and 
learned about the subcontracting 
project, they sprang into action, 
holding a series of employee par­
ticipation meetings to inform 
the other union members at the 
Beinecke about the project and 
to start pushing back. “Bad man­
agement decisions often become 
a really good organizing impetus 
for us,” Garcia said. “It was a really 
unifying thing to watch the union 
members, first in technical services 
at the Beinecke and then at the 
Beinecke as a whole, rally together 
to push on management to respect 
our work and the library.” After 
months of pressure, the library 
offered a partial concession and 
created four new temporary posi­
tions to help with the backlog. But 
the multimillion dollar contracts—
and the potential local jobs they 
represented—remained.

What made the 2019 subcon­
tracting issue particularly trou­
bling for the union was that its 
announcement came just months 
after the deadline for Yale’s hiring 
agreement had passed. It seemed 
like a pointed refusal to hire local 
residents for union jobs, even 
though Yale needed the work­
ers. That anger grew during the 
pandemic, 
when 
many 
New 
Haven residents who lacked stable 
employment struggled to pay rent 
and put food on the table. 

“The beautiful thing about 
belonging to a labor movement 
is that your interest is not just in 
making life better for people who 
are part of the union, but also to 
make that ripple outward to the 
communities that are negatively 
impacted by a large employer,” 
Garcia told me. “If Yale, instead 
of shipping our jobs out, really 
wants to make a positive impact
