There we were. Six women lying on 
the floor breathing in and out in 
rhythm. And there alone sat my hus-
band, watching us all with incredulity. 
"These are exercises? My child will be 
the result of these?" I could hear him 
saying. It was hard to believe that the 
exercises we were taught would help 
labor, but my husband and I dutifully 
followed the six classes in preparation 
for childbirth. When labor began, I 
was grateful that we had attended. 

My husband had asked only one 
thing of me: "Please don't wake me 
up at two in the morning to go to the 
hospital!" It seemed an easy request, 
but at around one o'clock the con-
tractions came at five minute inter-
vals. We bad been told not to phone 
the doctor until this spacing con-
tinued for an hour. I lay there, 
breathing in through the nose and out 
through the mouth-quick, short 
breaths high in the chest- until an 
hour had passed. They had not 
slackened. At exactly two I woke my 
husband. His first response was, "Are 
you sure they're contractions?" I had 
to admit I wasn't sure; I'd never had 
them before. We called the doctor to 
report, and to ask what contractions 
should feel like to my husband. He 
replied that during them my stomach 
should become so hard my husband 
could bit his hand against it and have 
it bounce off readily. We left for the 
hospital at 2:30. 

At the hospital I was taken to a 
small labor room, given a hospital 
gown, and placed on a movable bed. 
Emily Procaccini recently gave birth to 
Piero Procaccini. 

My husband was allowed to stay with 
me during the entire labor and de-
livery to help me remain relaxed and 
calm during labor. A machine next to 
the bed measured and recorded the 
baby's heartbeat and the contractions. 
The nurse strapped around my waist 
a belt attached to it. For a few hours 
my husband and I amused ourselves 
with the machine, watching the con-
tractions reach a peak on the paper 
graph and then subside. 

Then the nurse announced that my 
contractions had slowed down. In-
stead of becoming more frequent- as 
they should-they were coming at 
seven minute intervals. A resident 
doctor came in to break my bag of 
water; as she did, I felt a gush of 
warm water spread over my legs and 
the bed. Being in labor was like being 
in a submarine, plunged into the 
depths, and yet being able to hear 
and see with a periscope the whole 
world above sea level. The room 
seemed enormous and at times 
crowded with people. The nursesâ€¢ 
insistence seemed overly forceful, 
their personalities excessively stub-
born. 

I still did only short, light breath-
ing. I occasionally sucked on ice 
chips, since one's mouth dries in labor 
because the mouth constantly 
breathes. A new nurse came on duty 
and decided that the belt monitor for 
the machine was not recording the 
baby's heartbeat well enough. The 
resident reached inside to attach an 
electronic clip to the head and the 
heartbeat bleep on the machine went 
back into action. 

My contractions began to get 
stronger and more frequent. I began 
to hyperventilate. To prevent it, I 
breathed into a paper bag. I switched 
to "pant-blow" breathing. My hus-
band told me which parts of my body 
to relax. The nurse noticed some 
irregularities in the heartbeat and 
asked me to tum on my left side. The 
irregularities did not correct them-
selves, so again the resident was 
called in along with what seemed like 
fifty other people, and fmally also my 
doctor. They kept talking about 
"cords" an4 I asked what they were. 
They explained that if the heartbeat

stops for any length of time, the 
umbilical cord could be wrapped 
around the baby's neck or could have 
gotten twisted in some way. They 
were concerned about the baby get-
ting oxygen since the monitor regis-
tered some heart trouble. 

Before deciding to perform a 
Caesarean section, they inserted an-
other clip on the baby's bead to make 
sure the irregularities were not due to 
a faulty clip. As soon as the new clip 
was on, the heartbeat resumed its 
regular pulsation. The anxiety about 
a possible Caesarean did not relax 
me. As a result, when the doctor 
checked on my dilatation, I was only 
seven centimeters dilated (full dilation 
is ten). He gave me something to 
speed up my contractions and said, 
"You probably have two more hours 
to go." Could I make it? 

The main problem is fatigue. Labor 
for the first child is usually so long 
that one becomes overtired. One loses 
the strength to endure the more fre-
quent overwhelming pressure on the 
body, or the strength to breathe 
slowly and in tempo. Fatigue and the 
fear of hurtling out of control prevent 
many women from completing child-
birth without anaesthesia .. 

Many women now opt for only 
partial anaesthesia, "peridural" or 
"epidural." This usually numbs the 
area from the waist down without 
making the woman unconscious. If 
she takes a peridural, she can remain 
aware without having to deal with the 
pressure of contractions. But since the 
drug passes to the child, the peridural 
can also prolong labor. The mother 
who takes one cannot participate as 
fully in the delivery since it often 
prevents her from pushing along com-
pletely with each contraction. I had 
been determined not to take anything 
for labor. 

I had the urge to push, but since I 
wasn't fully dilated I might tear my 
cervix. The nurse asked if I wanted to 
take some Demerol to relax. I said 
no. Each contraction required full 
concentration. I grabbed my hus-
band's wrist to relieve the pressure. I 
had to switch to the method of 
holding my breath and then blowing 
out at the end of the contraction. My 
husband's wrist was sore for a week 
afterward. 



A particularly difficult contraction 
started and I didn't concentrate on 
breathing; I had been listening to the 
nurse talk about the clip to my hus-
band; the wave rushed through my 
body and engulfed me; I began to 
gasp, as though crying for air ... Relax 
this leg-relax it!" my husband said. I 
" 
wanted to push, but had to hold it in. 
A different nurse came in the room 
and s~id, "Slow down your breathing, 
slow 1t down!" I hated the nurse at 
that moment for being so rational, 
but later I was grateful to her. She 
made me slow down and concentrate 
on control. The next contractions 
were easier to take. 

The contractions were stronger by 
now though, and I felt very tired after 
each one. My nurse said, "Would you 
like something to relax you?" I asked 
if this would help dilate the cervix 
faster. "Yes," she said. My doctor 
came in and measured my cervix. 
"Half an hour more," he said. 

"Half an hour?" I repeated, in 
between contractions. "Will the con-
trations get any stronger than this?" 
.. No," he said. "They'll be as strong 
as the contractions you've been 
having." 

I calculated roughly and guessed I 
would have five more contractions in 
half an hour. "Oh, I can make it 
through five more contractions," I 
told my husband. "I don't want to 
take anything." It seemed only a few 
minutes until a new doctor hurried in. 
"O.K., she's ready," he told the nurse. 
"Have her push a few times before we 
go into delivery." 

I finally got to push. The contrac-
tion came. I raised my legs, took a 
deep breath and held it. I bore down 
as hard as I could and pushed until I 
felt blood rush to my cheeks. Finally 
there was a reason for all the other 
contractions. Finally there was work 
to be done, and I knew how to do it. 
All the unpleasantness and discomfort 
disappeared. The baby's bead 
crowned. They wheeled me to the 
delivery room. In the hall I began 
another contraction ... May I push?" I 
asked . 

.. Go ahead, breathe in, hold your 
breath, bear down, push as though 
you were going to have a bowel 
movement." In between contractions 
they transferred me to the delivery 
table and set up my legs in the 
stirrups. My husband appeared wear-
ing his mask and green surgical 
pajamas and sat down beside me. The 
new doctor said, .. Only two more 
contractions and we'll have your 
baby's head out- we're trying to feel 
which way it's facing. Push hard 
now- is a contraction coming?" 

"No, yes, now it's starting." 

"O.K., push down hard along with 
it." I pushed until I thought my 
bottom would split. 

"O.K., relax now and wait f"r the 
next contraction- you're doing fine. 
We're going to cut you to give the 
baby's head more room to come 
out- we'll give you novocaine for the 
cut." 

The next contraction began. I took 
a deep breath. "Push," my husband 
shouted as he held up my head. 
"Push, push!" I pushed hard for the 
excitement in his voice, but the head 
didn't show on the mirror above me. 
The doctor said, "We're going to 
use forceps on the next push." 

"Do you have to use forceps?" 

"They won't hurt the baby. We 
don't want the baby in the canal for 
too long a time-we think his head is 
facing up." This was an unusual 
position and made it more difficult to 
push him out. 

They inserted forceps into the 
vagina around the baby's head. The 
next contraction came. I pushed and 
could see a red, squinting face coming 
into the mirror. "With the next con-
traction you can push out the shoul-
ders and the rest of the body," the 
doctor said. I was close to tears with 
excitement. The body slithered out 
along the umbilical cord, a beautiful 
silver blue color. They whisked the 
baby away to the warming table as 
soon as they cut the cord. It was 
11:28 a.m., nine hours since we had 
left for the hospital. 

"You have a boy." 

"Oh, it's a boy!" I turned to my 
husband and hugged him joyfully. 
"Does be have five fingers on each 
hand and five toes on each foot?" I 
asked. 

"He's fine." As soon as the pedia-
trician had examined him they 
wrapped him up. My husband held 
him in his arms. We talked to him as 
we waited for the placenta to come 
out. 

After one more contraction the 
placenta was expelled. The doctor 
sewed up the episiotomy. That took 
about twenty minutes and was the 
most painful part of labor, particu-
larly since the novocaine wore off. All 
three of us went back to the labor 
room together. We stayed there for 
about a half hour before the nurses 
took the baby to the nursery. My 
husband went home to feed the dog. 

I was left in the room by myself for 
awhile and I felt at peace with life, 
pleasantly tired. I was happy that I 
had gone through the delivery with 
complete awareness, and had partici-
pated so actively in the birth of 
another person. Life seemed cyclical 
At that moment, I bad just helped to 
complete one of its most beautiful 
cycles. 

Natural childbirth is not natural. If 
it were truly natural, there would be 
no need for a special term. Natural 
childbirth consists of an artificial shell 
of learned responses which help a 
woman through labor. 

Labor is usually divided into three 
stages. The first stage can last from 
eight to ten hours during which the 
cervix dilates with regular contrac-
tions. The second stage can last from 
one and a half to two hours and is 
the pushing stage, the stage when the 
cervix is completely dilated and the 
baby moves through the birth canal 
and is born. The third stage of labor 
lasts ten to twenty minutes and 
consists of the time between the birth 
of the baby and the expulsion of the 
placenta. Perhaps the hardest period 
of labor falls within the first stage, 
called the transition stage. It occurs 
when the cervix dilates from seven 
centimeters to full dilatation-ten 
centimeters. Transition stage contrac-
tions are very strong. They sometimes 
last a minute, with intervals of two 
minutes. 

"Real" natural childbirth might be 
painful in many cases, but in "natural 
childbirth" methods there are three 
steps for eliminating the discomfort of 
labor. Fear often causes tension 
which then causes pain during a con-
traction. The first step, then. is to 
reduce fear of childbirth by educating 
the woman about her body and the 
functions of contractions in aiding the 
baby's passage down the birth canal. 
The second step is to eliminate muscle 
tension other than the tension caused 
by fear. The third step is to eliminate 
the feeling of helplessness and lack of 
control which contributes to tension 
and pain. 

Exercises are prescribed for these 
last two steps. Since two things 
happen to the body during contrac-
tions-one's muscles tense in response 
to the tensing of the uterine muscles, 
and one's breath tightens in response 
to the pain of the tension- two types 
of exercises are recommended: re-
laxation exercises for muscles and 
control exercises for breathing. 

The exercises are also utilized to 
eliminate discomfort by requiring the 
woman's full concentration. Since the 
brain can register only so many im-
pulses in a given instant, intentional 
concentration on certain controlled 
impulses can eliminate the recording 
on the brain of the impulses associ-
ated with contractions and their pos-
sible pain. In more concrete terms, if 
one's brain is busy concentrating on 
breathing and relaxing, no pain im-
pulse has a chance to imprint itself on 
the brain. One doesn't feel any pain. 
It is the same principle which applies 
when one cuts oneself, but is too busy 
to notice until later.
