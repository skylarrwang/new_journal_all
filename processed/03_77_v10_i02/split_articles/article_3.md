Meanwhile: from a first-year rned student 
by John Freedman 
It is the first day at Yale medical 
school and time to meet my cadaver. 
Eighty-three years old and her flesh is 
like rhino leather. She lies pickled in 
formaldehyde, a corpulent octo-
genarian who, in an act of love, gave 
her body to us. My knife is poised for 
that unkindest cut. It's not a person 
anyway. It's a stiff. Wait-even in the 
cold gray eye of death I spy life. I 
must quit this necropolis. 

John Freedman is a first-year student 
at the Yale Medical School. 

I walk down the hall and am 
flanked by a gallery of little ghouls, 
bottled fetuses whose genes turned 
traitor or whose primal sea soured. 
As I look at these unfinished crea-
tures, rudely stamped, I see an ele-
ment of pure humanity, of life and 
beauty and potential even in this 
degenerate flesh. Embryology aside, I 
wonder what has happened here. 

I step into the Intensive Care unit 
and watch the machines flash and 
hear them beep and click and keep 
people alive. Consciousness is a 
luxury here. The colors seem strange. 
The noises and smells, even the 
doctors and nurses seem strange. Now 
I understand: this is an antechamber 
of the afterworld, a place where life 
and death meet and mingle. 

I'm in the Emergency Room on a 
Saturday night. The gods are acting 
like wanton boys again: to smash a 
face has been their sport tonight. I 
hope the surgeons can un-smash it. 
The little boy who's been charred so 
bad his flesh is falling off in chunks-
can anybody help him? Yes, thank 
God. But it is hard knowing that I 
cannot help him, not now. It is the 
lot of the ftrst year medical student to 
bear witness and be unable to help. 

I am told that what weighs on me 
now is inconsequential compared with 
what is in store. This seems logical. 
But beginnings are difficult, and it 
seems that what I see and feel now 
cuts so deep because I have not yet 
developed the emotional armor that 
comes only with time. I wonder if 
armor is what I really want. I think 
of the Pendragonian surgeon who 
drags a string of souls behind him, 
and I shudder. 

In the first year at medical school 
we have little time to think. What 
seems to be the central dogma of the 
first year curriculum has a strange 
pedagogical twist: learn the facts now, 
think later. In devoting ourselves to 
amassing information, we supposedly 
acquire that depth and breadth of 
knowledge that will make us great 
thinkers later. 

No matter that it is boring and 
tiresome, that there is precious little 
subtlety in what we do and no more 
than a smattering of synthesis- other 
than the bio-kind. We all love to hate 
the first year, but its very non-
intellectuality is an incentive, for we 
bear that next year will be different. 
The strategy that failed Hamlet is the 
right one for us: the readiness is all. 

Nothing is so deceptive or alluring 
as a good surface. In terms of careers, 
the surface is our image of a particu-
lar profession, or our idea of what a 
professional does. This, I admit, drew 
me to medicine. Through reading, 
summer work in hospitals, and con-
versations with physicians, I sought to 
find out what the profession was all 
about. I see now that it is impossible 
to understand from the outside. To 
become a medical student is to pene-
trate the patina of image and plunge 
beneath the surface into that sul-
phurous and often bitter stuff which 
is medical training. 

The road ahead will be difficult. 
Tenacity will be of primary impor-
tance. It is a tenacity which will not 
come easily, one that cannot be eked 
out of a hypertrophied super-ego. 
Selfishness will not help; thoughts of 
money or prestige or preferment wax 
trivial in the face of life and death. A 
good part of the spectrum of human 
anguish will become my stock and 
trade. I feel now that only a deep and 
abiding love for the science and art of 
healing wiJJ make what I will go 
through worthwhile.
