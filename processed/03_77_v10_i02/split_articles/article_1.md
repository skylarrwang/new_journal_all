The Trouble with Law School


How can you kick a law school
whose dean will join your table at
Naples' and listen with good humor
as you ridicule the "telephone-book
imagination" of a young faculty member? And when that dean, with a
more serious good humor, will also
discuss his frustrations in trying to
keep up with developments in his
field? How can you be ungrateful
when the dean of student affairs will
listen to your reasons for wanting to
re-schedule exams, and offer to proctor them himself on a weekend? At
how many other law schools can you
knock on most professors' doors and
be given much more than the time of
day?

Yale is an enlightened place. Student
representatives sit with faculty
members on committees for educational planning, admissions policy,
and student discipline. The course
offerings are a model of social commitment. Alongside Bankruptcy and
Antitrust, you can find such courses
as Equality and the Law, Legal
Regulation of the Biomedical Sciences, and Lawyers as Change Agents.
In addition to these riches, the law
school offers still more educational
flexibility: joint degree programs,
clinical programs in neighborhood
civil legal assistance, prison legal
services, and mental hospital legal
services. It even offers full-credit
intensive semesters away from New
Haven at the Center for Law and
Social Policy, the Vera Institute for
Justice, and almost any other place
you can find a non-paying niche.

Then there are the formal, semi-
formal, and informal student organizations: Moot Court, Barristers'
Union; Environmental Law Association, Yale Association of International
LawÂ· Law Women's Association,
Black Law Students Union; law
school football, law school basketball,
law school baseball. This is just part
of the wealth. Only someone wrapped
in his own cloud could not find a
place in the sun at Yale Law School.

It is not easy, then, to make any
criticism of the law school intelligible
to others. I admit that I don't know
of any improvements in the structure
of the law school that could change
my criticisms. The collective activity
of students and faculty-not the institution alone- also constitutes our
"legal education." The listening,
prodding, parroting, and showmanship in the classroom; the earnest
discussions in the hallway afterwards,
sometimes with the corralled professor, the endless library whisperings
about the "fair" or "equitable," the
"allocation of risk and costs," "conceptual frameworks," "distinctions
without difference," "irrebuttable presumptions"-this is part of the
process.

The library whisperings metamorphose into the constant babble of the
dining hall. Serious-minded intensity
of effort, hardly checked by the hours
in a day, is lavished upon student
activities. After all, it is within the
power of Yale Legislative Services to
draft statutes that will overrule the
Burger Court on defendants' rights,
harness the CIA, and guarantee due-
process hearings for disciplined grade-
schoolers. And the Moot Court prize
case at the end of each term always
seems to promise "landmark significance." And your humor--don't forget it, but sharpen it into legal
humor. Yet do we really want to hear
again about respiratory estoppel as an
appropriate remedy for unconscionable fools, or about third-party suicide as the solution to an annoying
roommate?

It all seems a process, early initiated
and continually accelerating in
the course of three years, of "being
conformed"- and then striving to
conform, and helping one another to
conform. One acquires "professional"
motivation and values, even appropriate "personal" (if a person remains to
attach them to) speech, manner, and
drives. This process continues despite
the richness and flexibility of the
institution and despite the oh-so-
interesting backgrounds of students,
from Peace Corps in Africa to theology training in England. It continues despite the diversity of outward
direction, whether it be radical criminal lawyering, neighborhood storefronting, public sectoring, or that
traditional failure of the imagination,
the law firm.

The institution is distinguished
from the experience as a whole, which
I would distinguish from the individual and decent human beings each
of us knows. One professor must have
seemed the "grand old man" for the
past thirty years and will probably
remain in his prime for another
thirty. He likes to introduce his discussion of jus tertii by calling it "one
of those black tags that lawyers use to
distinguish themselves from human
beings." With obvious glee, he will
explain that he "invented" a part of
assignment law by coming across a
couple of cases "quite by accident"
one day and including them in his
casebook. He does all this with no
care for adulation, with no high and
serious conviction that the legal world
could not have done without him.
Rather, his self-amusement intimates
that his life's work is at once an
advance in the legal world and,
something of a peculiarity in the face
of everyday life.

Another professor has found his
way to Yale through the upper
reaches of the Justice Department
and the corporate world. He can
speak with reserved conviction about
equality and fairness in the context of
political and civil rights. He seems
not to see legal injustices that ought
to be legally righted, not to see rights
in conflict as the business of life, not
to conceive of the good in the just
