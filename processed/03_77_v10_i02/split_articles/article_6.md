Sitting next to me are the suitcases 
in which I packed everything when I 
agreed to write this article. A tinge of 
excitement eggs me on as I break a 
resolution not to publicize my feelings 
about play reviews. But my fingers 
are poking anxiously at the typewriter 
keys now that a cab is on its way. 
When those who are producing, 
studying, and reviewing theater at 
Yale are already bristling with indig-
nation, to raise one's voice is to 
become a new target. So be it. My 
bags are packed. 

Mention Williamstown, Drama 40, 
or Yale Drama School to serious Yale 
undergraduate actors and you will 
soon discover strong feelings, based 
on insecurity, about their talent in 
relation to these training grounds. 
Auditions, with their almost public 
competition, produce many jealous 
feelings. Comparing Yale dramatics to 
athletics reveals on the one hand a 
basic feeling of fellowship and mutual 
respect and on the other, disappoint-
ment and frustration. This might

indicate the difference between Yale's 
large commitment and enthusiasm for 
sports, and her continuing uncertainty 
about whether the arts deserve com-
plete moral- if not financial-sup-
port. Yale Daily News Arts Editor 
Allison Silver put her finger on it in 
an article (3/ 8/ 77) where she dis-
covered that the laughter of students 
who. work on residential college pro-
ductions has an edge. One sees more 
sneers than smiles. 

It is not clear that the several 
writers under Ms. Silver's current 
supervision, the reviewers of the Daily 
News, have dreamed of the role that 
t?ey ~ght play in redeeming a 
Situation replete with bad feelings. 
Not that they are insensitive to the 
fact that something is peculiarly 
wrong. 

Often with a Watergate-like confi-
dence, the Daily News points an 
accusing finger at a director, actor, or 
even at Shakespeare in an effort to 
excoriate the villain. This might have 
cathartic good effects if the pretender 
were indeed a villain and if he would 
lie down and quietly expire. The 
Daily News is betting against great 
odds that this will happen. Many of 
the actors and directors are shrivelled 
up, no doubt, by reviews, but they 
manage to live on in spite of it. It is 
possible to pursue another course of 
action and, incredible as it may seem 
to you and I assure you that it is 
incredible to me, I will now take the 
risk of describing this course to you, 
ch"er /ecteur. 

We begin with the attitude that 
theater is easy. Whenever I read a 
review that makes the "right way" 
sound "easy," I know I am reading a 
novice. Again and again the director 
realizes that he is in the dark about 
many things. Yet he presents a 
strong but complete concept to actors 
and techtes who will understand and 
evaluate his words in unforeseeable 
ways. When he is in the heart of 
conflict between immediate needs he 
is expected to be-and often is~ool­
headed about it all. The actor faces 
the demands of the director, the 
script, the set, and his own needs in 
preparation for performance. The 
techies face long evenings of continu-
ous work, regulations governing the 
use of the space, and living with 
severe financial restrictions. They re-
ceive little recognition. No defeat is 
ignominious. Don't believe them if 
they tell you that directing is obvious 
or that good acting is a cinch. 
Margaret Layne's review of "Four-
play" (4/ 8) is reassuring in its effort 
to recreate a sense of last minute 
excitement and panic. 

Next, the attitude that poker-faced 
detachment plus a strong sense of the 
difference between good and bad 
theater is the key to theatrical insight. 
If you refuse to participate in the 
illusion because you have lost your 
ability to believe childishly, then you 
really cannot pretend to be a good 
audience member-let alone a good 
critic. Participation is mandatory. 
When Marie Colvin claims, in her 
review of .. A View from the Bridge" 
(4/ 6) that "we remain painfully aware 
that they are performing; they are 
students uncomfortable with the 
naturalistic dialogue rather than emi-
grant Sicilians in a Brooklyn slum," 
one suspects that most members of 
the audience did not suffer this

painful awareness. They were willing 
to admit, as Marie might have ad-
mitted herself, to not knowing very 
much about Sicilians, and to not 
especially caring one way or the 
other. When Marie remarks that "the 
choreography of the final death scene 
is s~perb," she leaves us wondering if 
she 1s not among those who think 
about choreography and pacing even 
when the moment is superb. 

Closely related to detachment is the 
familiar mechanism of shifting atten-
tion from what was done to what 
might have been done. This tactic 
presumably spares the reader the 
dulling process ("it would be unfair 
and dulling to plot" ( 11 /6 /76)) of 
hearing about the actual production. 
It allows the reviewer the liberty of 
expatiating on his own good ideas. 
Many reviewers calmly adopt the 
fiction of protecting the interests of 
the playwright. "Miller's tragic reality 
is obscured by this very intensity." 
(4/ 6) Sometimes the playwright 
speaks his intentions through the 
mouth of the reviewer: "Brecht's 
characters simply do not taste their 
cigars."' (2/ 25) A reviewer might 
assume the intimacy of passing judg-
ment on an up-and-coming dramatist 
as the reviewer of "Winter's Tale" 
' 
does in calling Shakespeare's dialogue 
"dull." (4/8) 

Generalizations often leave us a bit 
dizzy. A r~view of the Long Wharfs 
"St. Joan" mentions in passing that 
"interpretation is not a question of 
transformation but of realization." 
Later, the review admonishes that 
"Long Wharf productions do not 
suffer from the anxiety of the ground-
less search for novelty [as do Yale 
Rep productions]." (3/ 11) 

The attitude of detachment, ideas 
~bout what might have been, speak-
mg from the dead playwright's point 
of view, these can be symptomatic of 
only one thing: the poor critic's inno-
cent response to the need, as ·he 
perceives it, to evaluate at all costs. 
Counterpoint. Point out the good and 
the bad. Above all, evaluate critically 
and fairly, but evaluate. 

The effort to make everything come 
out in the wash by tying some of the 
good to some of the bad and then 
adm?nishing us to go see it is pulling 
rabbits out of the hat. No one is 
fooled by statements like "Despite 
some sloppy acting and uninspired 
direction, 'Adaptation' is well worth 
any audience's participation." (2/ 11) 
Or, "Excellent acting offsets an un-
even script and combine to foment a 
worthwhile evening." (3/ 28) These are 
the consolation prizes awarded by the 
critic who is naturally beginning to 
sicken of the evaluating process by 
the end of the review.

Embarrassing to the cast, disil-
lusioning to the general reader, I do 
not beHeve that passing judgment is a 
source of gratification for the re-
viewer. I am in fact the mad radical 
who beHeves that most reviewers do 
not even consciously intend to do 
much evaluating, but that old theater 
terminology traps them-words like 
timing, comedy, balance, characteriza-
tion, pacing, convincing acting, light-
hearted laughs, hilarious effect, styli-
zation, professional standards, and 
phrases like "the diction and rhythm 
of speech" (2/ 10), "fast-paced se-
quence," "flow of the narrative" 
(3/11), "bringing life into rather 
colorless roles" (3/ 4) are poisonous 
language. 

Reviewers must give up any trust in 
these deceptively simple terms, since 
they conceal many important issues. 
"And it's timing that made it [work?]. 
Successful timing in both delivery and 
transition . ., (2/ 4) Behind a term Hke 
"good timing,., I see the characters or 
the audience being encouraged to 
jump to conclusions, or an actor's 
awareness moving quickly and dis-
creetly from his emotional to his 
physical environment and back again. 
"Good timing" might be spiritual 
agility and preparedness without 
having to leave behind personal 
values. In another context, "timing" is 
dogged determination and unflinching 
repetition of the same response. 
"Convincing acting" is an even larger 
concept. It probably has something to 
do with the actor's level of excite-
ment, the clarity of his vision of his 
ultimate values and objectives, his 
ability to convey a personal message 
relevant to the play, his modest 
immediacy in relationship to the 
audience .... Who knows bow we 
come to suspend our disbelief? I am 
baffled when a reviewer claims that 
the actin wa$ "unconvincing" and 
lets it go at that. 

Talking about all plays in terms 
like pacing and characterization is 
like talking about all sports events in 
terms of running and passing. Be-
tween the moment of intense partici-
pation in seeing a production and 
that of putting one's impressions 
down on paper, there might come the 
careful examination in thoughtful de-
tachment-free of predetermined 
word-packaging-of the intangible 
though powerful forces that shape 
theater. The critic can shed light on 
what is murky, and he can interpret 
and integrate into our experience 
that which is clear. 

He can reveal what mi~bt account 
for the way people act at 
times, and the way an 
audience responds. He can provide 
the valuable insight of the reflective 
observer by suggesting how, as per-
former or audience, we might sharpen 
our sensibilities. He may merely tell 
us something we cannot see for 
ourselves or he might get us inside the 
illusion or behind the scenes to reveal 
our u~ounded preconceptions of 
what things are like by revealing his 
own. Adopting this course of action 
requires no more drastic a step than 
to give up the outworn jargon of 
reviews. They are no magic formulae. 
It would be a step toward alleviating 
the profound distrust of theater that 
generates bitterness in the profession, 
and suspicion in the minds of bright 
Americans- some of whom are at 
Yale. 

I bear the honking of a cab. What 
will I be thinking about? What direc-
tors think about: finding out where 
the tears come from, finding the 
emblematic, keeping eyes open to 
human nature, making a performance 
a Httle clearer, a little more inevitable. 
But now I will grab these things and get 
out of here.
