W. H. Auden once remarked that a 
poet could count himself successful 
only when those who had never read 
his work expressed opinions about it. 
If the same is true of critics, I suspect 
Harold Bloom has long been a 
spectacular success. The New York 
Times, for instance, gave one of 
Bloom's recent books to an academic 
whom the editor probably expected to 
be completely unsympathetic to 
Bloom. The result was one of the 
most disquietingly bad pieces ever to 
appear under a very famous name. To 
adapt a remark Bloom himself made 
about Milton's Satan, it is sad to 
observe most critics observing Bloom, 
because they never do observe him. 
But if the Times is not the arbiter of 
success in these matters, the New 
Journal is much less so, and in any 
case Bloom has not always been 
denied his due. For the present book 
that due is very large; Wallace 
Stevens: The Poems of Our Climate is 
an extraordinarily good book, even 
for a critic whose earlier perform-
ances have led to the very high expec-
tations one has from Bloom. 

The book includes twelve chapters 
on Stevens's poetry, which is con-
sidered in the sequence of compo-
sition. Two chapters, the first and the 
last, consider critical theory. The two 
aspects are integrated with consid-
erable success, which may stem in 
part from the design of the book as 
an interpretive work with an extensive 
theoretical adjunct rather than the 
other way around. Bloom's earlier 
"tetralogy of studies in 'antithetical 
criticism,' " as his publishers called it, 
was sometimes too impatient to get 
its argument under way again when 
faced with illustrations from difficult 
poetry. The result was some unclarity 
in the argument. 

The readings Bloom gives here are 
lucid and convincing, particularly 
those of the late poems, which have 
been especially misunderstood in the 
past. The readings return to us with 
the alienated majesty of thoughts we 
should have had, and are almost an 
embarrassment to much previous 
Stevens criticism. One may well be 
grateful for the prescience Bloom 
brings to Stevens, considering even 
the best of what came before with 
considerable dissatisfaction. Previous 
studies range from the unbelievably 
bad to the qualified success. The 
presiding sin is the tendency to read 
Stevens's ironies as the central text, 
rather than as efforts to incorporate 
even his own large doubts into an 
encompassing vision of the American 
Sublime. 

Bloom is more receptive than the 
other major Stevens critics to the 
expansive claims Stevens never ceased 
to make for his imagination and for 
his poetry as an imaginative vehicle. 
He also understands the antecedents 
of these claims in Emerson and 
Whitman more thoroughly and sym-
pathetically than his predecessors. 
Moreovel", he writes throughout with 
an intensity equal to that of any of 
his other books. 

Bloom's method of sustaining his 
judgment· that Stevens's egotistical 
sublime is more egotistical and more 
sublime than others had thought-or 
his method of arriving at that judg-
ment-is intricately and persuasively 
bound up with the theoretical expo-
sition in the first and last chapters. 
The quick of the argument is in the 
last chapter. I recommend reading it 
immediately after the first chapter 
and then again after the twelve 
middle chapters. The argument is 
carried out largely as a respectful 
polemic against Paul de Man, J. 
Hillis Miller and Jacques Derrida. 
Both sides of the quarrel will be 
grossly wronged in summary, but 
some account other than simple 
praise must be ventured for a focal 
point of the book. In brief, decon-
struction, which in various forms is 
the method of the three critics men-
tioned above, analyzes texts by con-
sidering them as systems of inter-
dependent tropes, or substitutions, or 
"figures of speech." To describe these 
tropes they use the terms of tradi-
tional rhetoric. Their ultimate aim, 
however, is to reveal the inadequacy 
of both the terms used and the tropes 
described, and thereby to cast doubt 
upon the poetic mode of thinking in 
tropes. For instance, irony is the 
substitution of a (figurative) meaning 
for a (literal) meaning which seems to 
contradict the first meaning. A rhet-
orician of the old school might be 
content to say nothing more about it. 
The deconstructionist would point out 
that it is impossible simply to concede 
authority to the figurative meaning as 
against the asserted (albeit ironically 
asserted) literal meaning. 

We have two different meanings on 
two different levels of discourse. 
Hence an oscillation which cannot be 
resolved occurs. All tropes are so 
vulnerable; indeed, all tropes could be 
said to bear some similarity to irony 
in that they displace one meaning 
with a meaning which is different 
from it, and hence to some degree 
irreconcilable with it. And since in 
poems tropes depend upon one an-
other, instability piles on instability, 
and the distinction between figurative 
and literal language becomes blurred. 
Even the minimal "progress" a text 
makes by proceeding from one thing 
to another is not likely to be viewed 
as much more than another polarity 
to be revealed as arbitrary and stood 
on its head. 

A deconstructionist will be con-
cerned with taboo or forbidden his-
tories and assumptions, and it is thus 
to be expected that the deconstruc-
tionist as exegete should find at his 
end a radical and irresolvable doubt 
about the possibility of meaning in a 
structure whose deepest, in fact whose 
defining, claim is that it does mean. 
Bloom's own summary of his refu-
tation bears somewhat lengthy quota-
tion: "The limits of a purely rhetorical 
criticism, however advanced, are es-
tablished by its inevitable reductive-
ness, its necessary attempt to see 
poetry as being a conceptual rhetoric, 
and nothing more. Rhetoric, con-
sidered as a system of tropes, yields 
much more readily to analysis than 
does rhetoric considered as per-
suasion, for persuasion, in poetry, 
takes us into a realm that also 
includes the lie. Poems lie primarily 
against three adversaries: I) them-
selves 2) other poems 3) time. 
"Why do we believe one liar rather 
than another? Why do we read one 
poet rather than another? We believe 
the lies we want to believe because 
they help us to survive. Similarly, we 
read (reread) the poems that keep our 
discourse with ourselves going .... 
For the deconstructive critic, a trope 
is a figure of knowing and not of 
willing .... 
"A deconstructive reading of a 
poem must treat the poem's urging of 
us, to whatever, as the poem's own 
questioning of the language of urging. 
Here I cite John Hollander: 'But the 
urging of a work of literature, per-
haps accomplished by its formal 
frame, is no less an act of urging than 
any other kind of exhortation. The 
analysis of urging and exhorting can 
no longer be properly linguistic. And, 
finally, it is as such that it lies outside 
the realm of poetics.' " 

I find this wholly persuasive. 
Bloom refuses to demystify or de-
mythologize poems by taking their 
mythology away from them and from 
us- which deconstruction constantly, 
despite the contentions of its ad-
The New Journal I March 19, 1977 
herents, threatens to do. Poems may 
not be able to demonstrate anything 
save the problematic nature of their 
figurations, and troping as a mode of 
thought may fail of rigor. As 
Hollander implies, however, thought 
itself will then fail, but poetry is not 
called upon to do more than elicit our 
faith. The deconstructionists skirt a 
final no too insistently; we, like 
Stevens, demand after that a yes on 
which the world depends. 

The "diachronic rhetoric" Bloom 
goes on to sketch involves three 
"Poetic Crossings" or moments of 
disjunction in figuration: the Cross-
ings of Election, of Solipsism, and of 
Identification, which correspond to 
the rhetorical terms ethos, logos, and 
pathos, and to the Emersonian fate, 
freedom, and power. These crossings 
are introduced in the first chapter and 
used throughout the book. Like the 
six revisionary ratios, they are both 
stages in the development of a poet 
and characteristics of a given poem. 
Thus we are told that Stevens negoti-
. ated his crossings in 1915, 1921-22, 
and 1942 ·respectively, even as we are 
told that "Blanche McCarthy" evinces 
the crossings. The juxtaposition has 
the uncanny effect of offering us the 
poet's life as poet for an emblem of 
any of his poems. 

I am content merely to note the 
merit the crossings show in their use, 
though one might wish that Bloom 
had explored a bit further his hint 
that recourse away from a merely 
rhetorical criticism is likely to be 
recourse to a criticism which inter-
prets the will on at least partly 
psychological ground. Some notice, 
however, should be taken of what is 
really a highly condensed essay in the 
history of ideas in the last chapter. 
This history marks Bloom's first 
serious attempt to venture an expla-
nation as to why the various patterns 
he has set before us evolved as the 
patterns by which, and against which, 
Romantic poems defined themselves. 
In the Anxiety of Influence Bloom 
offered a brief apology for his failure 
to discuss Shakespeare on the ground 
that Shakespeare "belongs to the 
giant age before the flood, before the 
anxiety of influence became central," 
a passage which Paul de Man criti-
cized as embracing historical fallacies. 
(Mr. de Man also suggested that 
Bloom should have progressed from 
identifying an anxiety of influence to 
an anxiety of representation, i.e. an 
anxiety of or doubt about troping, 
but Bloom has resolutely declined to 
change his bread into stones.) 

We begin to see how prescriptive 
Bloom's maps really are, and one 
recalls his well-known gusto for the 
most pronunciatory canon-formation. 
To wonder if Pope could be called a 
strong poet in Bloom's sense is to 
stammer and fall silent. If it is clear 
that a contemporary Pope is out of 
the question, it is by no means so 
clear how that came to happen, how 
an experiment in form stratified into 
an expectation and finally, at least for 
Bloom, into something very like a 
standard. Yet the expectation that a 
poem will show a clear relation to the 
patterns, even in its transgressions, is 
borne out to an extent almost dis-
maying, and almost exhilarating.
