EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
.. No body knows about Stanley 
Elldn," I'd thought. To get a copy of 
his new novel The Franchiser, I had 
to place a special order. Having 
overheard, a one-eyed man in the 
bookstore approached me. "Elkin, 
huhT' he said in a conspiratorial 
whisper. 
.. Yes. You know of himT' 
.. I'll tell you son, I've got one eye 
left so I save it for what is really 
worth reading. That Elldn can really 
write." 

The man was right. In his new 
novel, Elldn displays a bold creative 
energy. Like other novels such as 
Bellow's Herzog and Walker Percy's 
Love in the Ruins, it shows us man 
attempting to cope with a broken, 
decaying world. 

Ben Flesh, the novel's hero, like 
Elldn himself, is dying from multiple 
sclerosis. The book is filled with the 
poignancy and intensity of a life with 
little time. This concentration of 
experience brings forth a comic 
celebration of the smallest givens of 
everyday life. 

Ben Flesh is the unseen hand 
behind the chain franchises that orna-
ment America, such as Howard 
Johnson's, Mister Softee, Fred 
Astaire Dance Studios, Colonel 
Sanders, and H & R Block. Flesh 
owns franchises in all parts of the 
country: the nights and days of the 
novel are spent in moving from 
franchise to franchise, motel to motel. 
The novel's restless movement shows 
Elkin's attempt to find a place for the 
individual in the seedy sameness of a 
mass-produced world. 

Flesh's career begins when his 
godfather, Junius Finsberg, whom he 
has never met, calls him to his death-
bed. Finsberg, who swindled Ben's 
father out of a fortune, went from 
being a poor tailor to designing 
costumes for the great musical 
comedies of the depression years. 
From beneath an oxygen tent, 
Finsberg makes reparation for his 
swindle. He reveals a vision to Flesh: 
Who would believe it? You weren't 
aborted, you didn't end up in a 
scum bag ... You outwitted 
whooping cough, typhoid, V.D. 
God bless you boy, you're a testa-
ment to the impossible! 

The celebration of mere being 
forms the central vision of the novel. 
Flesh reaffirms this by the end of the 
book as it comes full circle to his own 
approaching death. 

While the franchising of life reduces 
it to its lowest common denomi-
nator- like MacDonald's, it barely 
satisfies the basic need for food-
Elkin makes us marvel at life, even at 
this low level. By reaching everybody 
at basic levels, the chains of 
franchises .. structure life like scaf-
folding." Flesh is a modem prophet, 
an anti-Zarathustra, revelling in 
simple, squalid comfort instead of 
glorifying superhuman nobility. In 
parody of Zarathustra's "I speak the 
Superman!" Flesh tells us ••I come 
from Fred Astaire. Everybody dance! 
... Dance to the rate of prime 
interest itself." 

Although the book often rises again 
to moments of terrific humor and 
imaginative writing, it has difficulty 
finding movement beyond its original 
framework. It begins to move 
frantically from episode to episode, 
turning the same trick too many 
times. 

The messiness of the second half 1S 
redeemed by the renewal of vision 
Flesh experiences while dying in his 
Travel Inn. Listening to all the sex 
through the motel's thin walls, Flesh 
realizes that in spite of aU life's 
arflictions and disease, man cannot be 
kept from loving: .. There's scarlet 
fever and muscular distrophy and 
Hodgkin's disease ... and still they 
smooch ... French kiss with their 
throats sore and their noses running." 

It seems a shame that a novel so 
moving, imaginative and loving 
should be weighted down by the 
book's excesses and weaknesses. Yet 
Elkin's faults are generated from the 
excitement of his peculiar celebration 
of the ordinary, and finally it is this 
and not the faults that stay with the 
reader. Elkin convinces us that "the 
signs as they came on in nighttime 
Birmingham, all the blink-bulb neon 
and electric extravaganzas that stood 
out sharp against the sky, proved that 
every night Broadway opens every-where." 


**Deportment in Ropes**
**Author: Steven Graves**

There are no trilliums here about you, 
no pentstemons, more likely belladonna, 
poppy, anodyne of root or pistil 
that roars in your head and spills you 
into sleep, amusing you with sleep. 

No longer will I live among the names 
you have vacated, no more shadbush, 
toadflax, bee-balm, rather I will live 
with your slender stem withering in robes 
and with your eyes that reel, sick and abandoned. 

So also will I be empty of every 
other place: fencerows, bays of capricious grass, 
the whole wood alive with one song. Here, 
there is only disinfection, 
your dressing gown, or the cellar of your bed. 

Better to have no name for you, only 
this terminal, below the black sweeping fan, 
where you are fettered and rave, mad with ftre 
and talking with fire, pleading again 
for what you saw and knew and once felt.
