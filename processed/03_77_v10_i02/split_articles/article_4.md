Against Humaneness 
(continued from page three) 
instance as legal justice. I suppose he 
just has a human eye. In the inevi-
table complexity of good and bad, he 
sees the unnecessary bad which one 
can help alleviate. He believes that in 
some of this the law can play a part. 
And he stands ready to play his part, 
non-legal as readily as legal. 

A third-year student at the Uni-
versity of Chicago Law School asked 
me whether it was the students or the 
faculty who defined the character of 
Yale's collective experience. I an-
swered quickly that it was us, the 
students. He was surprised. He 
pointed me to an essay by Duncan 
(Funlcy Dunlc) Kennedy, then a Yale 
law student and now a Harvard pro-
fessor, in the Yale Review of Law and 
Social A ction (Vol. I, No. 1, Spring 
1970). It was entitled "How the Law 
School Fails: A Polemic." 

Kennedy spoke primarily against 
the arrogant hostility of teachers 
toward students and the emotional 
harm they inflicted. To him, the 
faculty defined the character of the 
law school- and much of it was bad. 
He wrote: 

One of the first and most lasting 
impressions that many students have 
of the law school is that teachers are 
either astoundingly intellectually self-
confident or just plain smug. Many of 
them seem to their students to be 
preening themselves before their 
classes. In most cases each gesture 
seems to say: 'I am brilliant. I am 
famous in the only community that 
matters. I am doing the most difficult 
and desirable thing in the world. and 
doing it well; I am being a Law 
Professor.' 

Kennedy further complained that "a 
vast amount of destructive energy 
does in fact go into the teaching of 
law as presently practiced." He ad-
mitted the students' complicity in the 
creation of the law school atmo-
sphere, but believed that .. most im-
pressive of all is the group's sub-
mission. . . . They accept the im-
portance of what they are about 
largely without question, and lay . 
themselves bare to the tender meretes 
of the teacher with an astonishing 
humility." 

My Chicago friend thought that 
Yale Law School must indeed have 
progressed. Kennedy's polemic of 
1970 seemed to him still true of 
Chicago but very different from my 
criticism of law school. No one I 
knew here had even beard of the 
essay. It seemed strange then, and still 
does now, that the essay should have 
been held as Truth by a Chicago 
student but totally ignored at Yale. 
Had Yale become that enlightened. or 
did we just stop caring, doubting? 

I think Yale Law School bas 
changed. Of course we have some 
from the Yale Law School Bulletin 
faculty members who stand out as 
prima donnas, a few others as bril-
liant bores. We even have a con-
tender for "the second best third-rate 
legal mind" and a couple of would-be 
sardonic wits. Most students, how-
ever, would not view the faculty as 
defining any character for the internal 
life of the law school, let alone a 
hostile one. The faculty has receded 
and the students have stepped forth 
into dominance. Our aggressive energy 
now charges the atmosphere. 

We preen ourselves in self- impor-
tance. We declare, more loudly than 
any teacher, that the display of one's 
own talent, the blank assertion of self, 
and the unrelenting never-doubting 
are the stuff of a lawyer. To deaden 
the character, to strip the personality, 
and to hew the unencumbered talent-
that is the .. legal education" for which 
we are responsible. To be a lawyer is 
to want such talent as will defeat that 
of others. All has been staked on 
talent, and all will be bargained away 
for it. 

Is all this just aesthetic repulsion at 
the collective experience of law 
school? I am not sure. I sometimes 
wonder whether the increasingly per-
vasive rule of law in society isn't also 
a growing tyranny by the likes of 
lawyers nurtured at Yale. I wonder if 
there can still be any ideal in the law 
that is recognized by lawyers as some-
thing outside and greater than them-
selves. 

Maybe there really was an ideal of 
divinely ordained natural law in the 
middle ages. Maybe nineteenth-
century common-law lawyers did 
believe in an evolution and preserva-
tion of values in an historical ideal of 
the law. Today we at law school seem 
to appeal to nothing less than a sense 
of justice, no greater than the ~wye~ 
in whom it is found. The new tdeal 
stands or falls with the lawyers them-
selves. It is not something to which 
they aspire. It is an expression of 
themselves. 

If contrary to legal inclination, we 
can 'separate the quality of justice 
from the successful assertion of a 
talented lawyer's sense of justice, then 
we might see that quality is dependent 
more on the simple decency of la~­
yers as human beings than on thetr 
talents as lawyers. It is a cliche to say 
that talent must serve decency; then 
why must the world seem topsy-turvy 
at Yale? 

In the course of our "legal educa-
tion" something happens to that sense 
of justice. As one teacher told an 
insulted class at the end of last year, 
he could see no passion in his 
students. Presumably, we are urged to 
serve with passion within the la~, and 
to commit our skill to that serv•'7·. In 
fact we have the dry lust of •'?'1~•­
tive talent. Such blind, exclustve un-
portance is placed ~n the develop-
ment of talent that m a crazy tum-
around of common moral sense we 
I fear sometimes that it is this 
perverted private motivation, multi-
plied on a grand scale among the 
graduates of law schools where talent 
runs high, that is responsible fo~ the 
spread of law. Yes, law should hav_e 
something to say about the allocatton 
of scarce medical resources and about 
norms for human experimentation in 
the biomedical sciences. And, no 
doubt, the hue and cry of environ-
mental lawyers is welcomed by those 
who earlier stood without legal allies 
against the Alaska wolf kill, highway 
mazes, and sewer sprawl. But must 
law presume to incorporate within 
itself all fields of knowledge? Must we 
flatten all aspects of human existence 
into a legal conceptual framework? 
Can't law serve without acquiring? 

I cannot accept law's claim to be 
queen of the sciences. I am not 
entirely persuaded that public schools 
ought to handle the discipline of fifth-
graders with a "due process model" 
(notice of cause, opportunity for a 
bearing, representation by formal or 
informal counsel, and so on). Even if 
such a model were appropriate, I am 
certain that it would come nowhere 
near the essential concerns of educa-
tion. Similarly, I accept that there are 
unavoidable legal questions to face 
when family, friends, and physicians 
exercise responsibility over a chroni-
cally ill patient. But I refuse to 
presume that, by defming legal duty 
and freedom with respect to that 
patient, we have grasped the impon-
derables of life and death and estab-
lished human morality. 

It can be countered that one will 
never bear lawyers claim such things 
in so many words. But the unspoken 
assumption of self-importance gives 
the lie to this. Acquisitive talent 
pervades endless conferences on "La_w 
and Education" and "Law and Medt-
cine" as well as the stream of trendy 
articles on the "legal implications" of 
this or that. Even a casual conversa-
tion prompted by a news story invites 
the acquisitive ploy: Attach the legal 
phrases, work the words around, and 
subject another piece of life to your 
knowledge. Because you've learned to 
do this act so well in the law, you 
come to believe that law is worthier 
than all else. One comes to believe 
that because he can do it well, law 
deserves to formulate the questions, 
elicit the answers, and state the truth 
of life in all its fullness. 

We have spread the word well. 
Bright young hordes of college gradu-
ates are now applying to law school. 
"I must understand law to be an 
effective urban planner." .. Journalism 
is my goal, but law is so involved in 
everything." "Of course English litera-
ture goes to the finer aspects of life-
and I will be as refined as ever in my 
private interests- but I want a larger 
audience than a classroom full of 
students." Our new lawyers seem to 
have started the conforming process 
before entering the door. While urban 
planning, journalism, and litera~ure 
may fall by the wayside, they wdl not 
be disappointed by law school. They 
will learn the skill to match their 
acquisitive impulse. 

I have been told that any pro-
fessional group, scientists or aca-
demics for example, can be arrogant 
and narrow, and that lawyers are no 
worse than the rest. Many of us have 
heard dire warnings about reduc-
tionist science vanquishing the bu-
7 
manities. Science would leave nothing 
sacred; it would destroy all mystery, 
would dismiss what could not be 
explained or quantified. This, bow-
ever, is precisely what seems different 
about science. It does reject or ignore 
some things. While it may lay claim 
to all real knowledge, it will do so by 
excluding what does not fit into its 
world and not be colonizing other 
fields of learning. 

Law, on the other band, would be 
the ugly mirror of all life. Lawyers 
would do what no philosopher, physi-
cist, or poet would feel himself fully 
capable of doing; they would claim to 
respond to the entire multitude of 
most basic human concerns. Apart 
from all other professions, law pre-
sumes to speak the language of 
humaneness with the voice of skill. 

Some might say this essay only 
echoes the fear that .. The last tempta-
tion is the greatest treason: To do the 
right deed for the wrong reason." If 
law is meant to do some good- and 
there is enough unnecessary social evil 
to last a millenium of lawyers' lives-
then the successful assertion of justice 
must be more important than the 
possibly venal motivation of lawyers. 
The purity of law as intellectually 
conceived will not accomplish what 
humanly motivated lawyers can. 

I can only reply, suggestively, that 
relying on one's successful talent 
hardly seems the way to assure that 
justice, not some slant verbal form of 
it will win out. I don't thinlc that we 
' 
. 
can fall back on the hired-gun tbests, 
even if we dress it up into the 
"adversary process." To admit that 
the brightest arguments ought to be 
advanced from each side does not 
assure that the decision-maker, him-
self trained in the pursuit of talent, 
will have the humility not to blind 
himself with the vision of the new, 
striking law he might write in his 
decision. To look at our "legal educa-
tion" will not answer where be could 
have learned to see the complexity of 
good and bad as something more 
than a challenge to his analytic 
powers. 

Outside the glamorous context of 
trials and appeals lie the broader 
fields where the likes of Yale gradu-
ates, I bear, become touted makers of 
policy. In business, government, and 
increasingly in the third sector of 
non-profit institutions, we must ac-
knowledge the great opportunity to 
ally the thrill of talent with effective 
power- without the pretense of the 
adversary process. 

Both within and without the law, I 
wonder whether we will espouse some 
just causes not for their justice but 
because they are fashionable arenas 
for the display of talent. I see no 
assurance that just causes will always 
be the fashionable ones. I wonder if 
we would buck fashion more if our 
"legal education" bad not let us so . 
easily bury decency under accomplish-
ment. And even if just causes do 
always remain fashionable, even if 
lawyers are selflessly motivated, even 
if they succeed astoundingly, how 
much humaneness will we aU lose by 
having justice in our grasp and the 
simple good gone from our imagina-
tion?
