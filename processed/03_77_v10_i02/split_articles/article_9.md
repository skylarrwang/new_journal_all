Our new driver had left New 
Jersey, got to Iowa City, and then 
decided to turn around and go back. 
"I was on my way," he said, "moving 
to Colorado, when something made 
me do a U-turn." This driver began 
by asking us if we were Christians. 
Next came a small booklet of apoca-
lyptic prophecies; and then our 
driver's life history. Heavily into 
drugs for eight years including heroin, 
he renounced them all a month earlier 
after a session in a fundamentalist 
church. He was preparing himself for 
the tribulation mentioned in the book 
he gave us. He wanted to make sure 
that we knew about salvation. God, 
he finally decided, had made him turn 
around in Iowa so that he could pick 
us up and let us know about his 
happiness. 

Even those that never stop for 
hitch-hikers feel a slight pang of guilt 
as they pass someone whose thumb is 
out. As long as the hitcher can 
provoke that pang, he and his art 
should survive. A seasoned hiker I 
know advertises a standing bet: he 
claims he can give anyone a twelve 
hour head start in a car from Maine, 
and he will follow hitch-hiking, 
promising to beat the single driver to 
California. His secret, he says, is a fat 
smile to every car. No one has taken 
him up on the wager. 

Standing on a barren strip of land 
in Wyoming, we saw a Volkswagen 
bus. We hoped it carried the usual 
sympathetic VW driver. It was cold, 
getting dark, and we knew he would 
stop. He had his van fixed for living; 
a mattress, shelves, and a lamp 
arranged in the back showed him to 
be a traveller like the two of us. 

After a year in college, he bad tried 
drugs, working, and wandering. When 
· we met, he had emerged from all but 
the last. In the three years since 
college, he had worked as a roust-
about on an oil rig, a chef in a high-
class restaurant, a mason, an elec-
trician, an underground mining 
mechanic. He knew hitch-hiking; he 
once made it from California to his 
home in Massachusetts with just three 
rides-a standing record, be told us. 

Outside Joliet, Ill., a tractor trailer 
pulled over for us. The driver carried 
40,000 pounds of plate glass from 
Detroit to Denver. He was proud of 
his turbo-Charged Detroit 318 diesel, 
proud of his ability to shift without a 
clutch, and proud to be an indepen-
dent trucker. He rambled on about 
life, the scenery, bow the foothills of 
the Rockies start in Iowa, and how, 
above all, "you can't fool Mother 
Nature." Nodding in agreement in his 
cab-over International, we let him 
talk all the way to Des Moines. "If I 
was young again," be said, "rd get 
me one of them vans, fix it up real 
nice, and then just travel across the 
country finding the women and the 
sun." At thirty-two be made a living 
doing the next best thing. 

Our shortest ride took us 500 
yards- our longest, 2000 miles, yet 
the cheap way to go bad its draw-
backs. I bought a car one week after 
our return. 


**I can feel healthy wearing cowboy boots**
**Author: Dan Leffel**

I was walking along Elm Street one 
morning recently, absent-mindedly 
stomping on pigeons, as I am accus-
tomed to do, when I noticed a young 
bearded young man pacing back and 
forth in front of the post office. I felt 
compelled to address him. 

"Excuse me, sir," I said, using my 
politest language. Fortunately, my 
politest language is English, which ·he 
seemed to understand. 

"Yes?" he said. 

"Well," I continued, ''I may be out 
of line with this, but there seems to 
be a rag on top of your head. I 
thought you might like to know." 

"Rag my foot!" he replied, with 
more than a pinch of indignation. 
"That's my turban!" I pinched him 
back and begged him to elaborate. 

"Allow me to call your attention to 
my sandwich-sign," he said. At first I 
hadn't recognized the two boards as 
a sandwich-sign, not having seen one 
in many years- not, in fact, since 
they fell out of use, about a decade 
before I was born. 

I looked at the sign. "Silver Lentil 
Compendium," it read. "Health 
Foods and Takti Shoes." It's only 
natural that if you're trying to adver-
tise shoes and health food you want 
to keep your head wrapped in a piece 
of dirty cotton. 

In any case, I've always had a soft 
spot for health, and certainly one for 
food as well. I must confess that I 
also wear shoes, especially on pigeon-
stomping days. So I asked my new 
friend where the compendium was 
located and ascertained that it was in 
the only natural location-the site of 
the old Saks store on York Street. I 
made tracks for just that place. 

It was a beautiful store, appointed 
with plush carpeting and plexiglass 
shelves, and peopled by men without 
sandwich-signs. But they all did wear 
beards and turbans; some wore cotton 
garments that looked like nightgowns. 
From large stereo speakers came the 
sounds of Hindu chants accompanied 
by a lone guitar. I was deeply moved 
by the message of this music, which 
seemed to be saying: "Buy a guitar 
and a chord book and you too can be 
a professional musician." 

Soon I realized that this was no 
ordinary purveyor of footwear and 
food. In addition to tapes of music 
available for purchase, the store sold 
natural hairbrushes and tonics. One 
of these tonics was Joyja Shampoo, 
which is made from the juice of the 
joyja bean. It comes wrapped in a 
brochure with many "before" and 
"after" pictures. The "befores" all 
suffer from varying degrees of bald-
ness, while the "afters" have full 
heads of hair. They also have dif-
ferent names and faces. 


I passed up the many appealing 
health food delicacies. Even a tempt-
ing "Ruby Begonia Sandwich" 
couldn't lure 95 cents out of my 
pocket. I wasn't saving my hard-
borrowed shekels for a little bit of 
cream cheese mixed with dates and 
nuts and held in place by two shingles 
of whole-wheat bread. 

Next to Ruby Begonia were the 
famous Takti Shoes. They looked 
very much like the shoes I had been 
wearing when I spontaneously broke 
my foot two years ago. When I 
bought mine nobody told me they 
weren't good for walking. I guess by 
now it's common knowledge that 
you're supposed to eat them. 

I wondered how so many seemingly 
unrelated pieces of merchandise had 
come together under one roof. But as 
I was about to chomp into a suede 
ankle-high boot that was on display, I 
overheard one of the salesmen mutter 
something about a theory connecting 
shoes with nuts, shampoo, bacteria 
and, I think "turbans." 

A lovely theory rm sure. But if 
some people have a theory linking 
physical and spiritual health with 
anything that happens to trickle out 
of Asia, I have an even better one 
that associates well-being with hold-
ing onto my money unless I find 
something worth spending it on. So, 
with a sudden hankering for a Coke 
and french-fries and with a pair of 
feet in my dusty cowboy boots, I said 
"Good day" to the Silver Lentil Com-
pendium and sauntered out.
