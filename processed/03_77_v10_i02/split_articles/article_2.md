Go by the Numbers 
by Corby S. Kummer 
Yale Law School is harder to get 
into than any other in the country. 
Incoming classes number 165 from 
3500-4000 applications yearly, in com-
parison to Harvard's 500 from 8000. 
A recent survey in New York, how-
ever, rated Harvard over Yale in 
prestige and chances for the b~st jobs. 
But it's nicer to go to Yale than 
Harvard, students and faculty say, 
because of Yale's size and less ob-
viously harried atmosphere. Other 
touted advantages like the non-
competitive Law Journal (in order to 
work on the school review elsewhere, 
. students must rank high in their 
classes) make life less strained. Did 
the good things I'd heard about Yale 
mean that creative, interesting people 
went there? To find out how classes 
are selected, I interviewed five past 
and present members of the admis-
sions committee. 

Yale is unique in that its own 
faculty rather than a trained admis-
sions staff reads student folders. The 
Dean of Admissions reads through 
each ftle as it arrives. He culls 1000-
1200 over the course of the year for a 
panel of twelve readers, who rate the 
folders from one to five (a rating of 
five is most desirable) and send them 
on. I wanted to know which parts of 
a student's ftle the readers found most 
important, and whether they looked 
for their own characteristics in appli-
cants as they rated folders. 

Corby S. Kummer decided against 
applying to law school after writing 
this piece for David Papke's seminar 
on the American Legal Profession. 
Susan Hanley (no names in this 
article are real, at the subjects' re-
quest), assistant to Dean Williams, is 
the one woman on the present com-
mittee, but does not feel she is a 
token. "Out of five members on the 
panel one's a woman and one's a 
black. That's the way it worked out. 
Everyone would make it on his own 
merit." 

Hanley is tall and thin. She smokes 
a lot and nervously twists her long 
black hair. Still, her manner is pro-
fessionally poised; she's accustomed 
to fielding questions, especially from 
students. Her background makes her 
more sympathetic to many students 
than most other readers. She went to 
Wisconsin as an undergraduate, and 
took a Ph.D. at Yale. "I look at my 
friends from college and see how 
much less luck they've had, although 
they're as good as I am," she says. 
"Students shouldn't be disadvantaged 
by where they are, although the other 
readers are more inclined to adjust 
their judgments according to under-
graduate institutions. The best grade 
point average (GPA) anyone can do 
anywhere is a 4.0. You don't know 
what they would have done else-
where. 

"It's reasonable that readers like 
things in students that they see in 
themselves. I have a higher degree of 
empathy for people who have done 
things I have. The same thing must 
happen to other readers." Class presi-
dents and the like don't impress her-
and never have-she hadn't partici-
pated in extra-curricular activities as 
an undergradute. "They're not likely 
to add skills or experience. I'm more 
responsive to people changing careers 
than if I hadn't changed them myself, 
and contemplate changing again." 

Hanley, who has taught history at 
Amherst, hopes to continue in college 
administration. 

Hanley's unusual background ac-
counts for her description of the law 
school as "interdisciplinarian." She 
refutes the image of the law students 
as corporate lawyers in training. "Stu-
dents select Yale for its flexibility and 
non-competitiveness," she claims. 
"They are motivated and self-disci-
plined." Earlier she described them as 
"interesting, hardworking, and grown-
up." 

Hanley took her present Yale job at 
31, 
years ago. "I wondered if I 
could enjoy the company of younger 
people. It turned out to be wonderful 
and intellectual. We talked shop end-
lessly. Nowadays the students get 
even better, I hear, in their capacity 
to understand, quickness and ability 
to relate creatively to material. The 
faculty is pleased, although their 
orientation is unfortunately and omi-
nously toward the academic." 

Lively and seemingly tireless, 
Hanley tours for Yale. She insists that 
Yale should recruit to "improve the 
fit" between student and school, al-
though she admits that every school is 
trapped into traveling because of 
nationwide law-school panels from 
which they cannot be absent. Because 
she is not a faculty member, Hanley 
pays more attention than they do to 
folders, and devotes more thought to 
the admissions process. She wishes 
that readers would meet as a group. 
"We should find out what values we 
share and to what extent, and give 
more attention to marginal cases." 

One of her jobs is to read the folders 
of those who were narrowly rejected, 
to see if she strongly disagrees with 
any of the decisions. 

"The ideal reader would look for 
what I do," she says. "I try to be the 
best I can be." Hanley looks for 
originality, variety, the "flash" of 
creativity in a student. If all the 
readers were like her, the committee 
might be ideal. But her background is 
far different from that of other 
readers, so her ideas of a good 
student are atypical. Compassion does 
not pervade the Law School faculty. 

A poster on the door of Ivan 
Gilner's sparse, cold office pictures a 
roaring lion: "In our business the 
customer is king," it proclaims. De-
spite its hired-gun implications, Gilner 
says he quit practice after six and one 
half years "because I decided I wanted 
to write and teach more than I 
wanted to make money." Gilner an-
swers questions quickly and deliber-
ately. 

"You must go by the numbers on a 
file. Their objectivity is their beauty," 
he says. "Letters of recommendation 
are of equal impressiveness, which is 
to say they are equally irrelevant. All 
geese become swans. Essays seldom 
make a difference on the plus side. 
They show a profile of interests and 
the ability to put together words. The 
interests can be feigned and change in
The New Journal f March 19, 1977 
any case. Facility with words can also 
be feigned, or assisted. The student 
writing an essay feels called upon to 
reach for the loftiest sentiments he 
can express. These are not relevant 
criteria." 

Gilner does rely on the quality of 
the undergraduate college to help him 
differentiate, as do all the other 
readers I saw. He pays little attention 
to the specific curriculum: "I'm in-
clined to suspect the so-called pre-
legal courses rather than the humani-
ties," he says in a rare moment of 
unconventionality. Time spent away 
from school counts for little, too. 
"The .simple passage of time does not 
mean. improvement." 

In order to contrast the typical 
class of his day with today's, I ask 
Gilner if he respected members of his 
own law class (Harvard, 1950). "There 
is no human being I don't respect," he 
replies sharply, then continues in 
lawyer-like fashion, "I'll re-
define your question to make it say 
what you meant." He goes on to say 
that the bottom of classes has im-
proved, but he likes the classes "no 
more, no less. We waste less time 
working with sub-marginal students." 

I ask if he likes the character of 
recent classes. "You don't mean per-
sonal character," he corrects me, al-
though that's just what I meant. "You 
mean statistical mix, which creates 
the class group. By and large it is 
more interesting and provocative to 
teach interesting students." 

The only thing Gilner cares about 
in admissions, he says, is to get the 
"top ofthe applicant pool." Perhaps 
Hanley had him in mind when she 
said the faculty's tendency was omi-
nously toward the academic. "Given 
the chance I would change the admis-
sions process, but I won't tell you 
how or why." On the way out I 
apologize for any questions he might 
have considered rude. "Your ques-
tions were o.k.," he says. ••you 
pressed as hard as you could. I didn't 
answer when I found the question 
inappropriate." 

Charles Lanford, Jr. seems a radi-
cal by comparison, although he is 
quite conservative. Of everyone I 
interviewed he had the most Wall 
Street-like office. The oriental carpet 
was lush; the Federal desk elegant. 
Lanford's manner is businesslike, full 
of straightforward common sense and 
full also of underlying elitism. He 
expects the best, and knows he'll get 
it. 

Instead of reading the folders of 
those who didn't quite make it, 
Lanford reads those of students to 
whom Dean Williams has given his 
highest rating. Students given a five 
are virtually guaranteed admission; 
Lanford reads their flies to see if he 
disagrees. Like Gilner he blends skep-
ticism with empiricism, but he pays 
closer attention than Gilner does to 
the student's choice of courses. "I 
look at the guts in the transcript," he 
says, .. or look for something funny in

it that suggests the student isn't that 
red-hot. The LSA T [law school board 
score] is the only objective piece of 
evidence we have. GPAs aren't that 
reliable. You know they're strong if 
from Yale or Harvard. 

"I view courses like History of Art 
skeptically. If you see something like 
bongo drums, you don't pay attention 
to an A in the course. Things like 
German and Calculus are hard. Eng-
lish is always easy- 1 could get A's in 
English courses any time I wanted. 
Grade inflation makes it hard to tell 
who has what. We hate pass-fail 
courses. The trend back to a more 
stratified system is a good thing." 
("I'm on the conservative side," he 
admits.) 

Nonetheless Lanford claims he 
looks for "something unusual" He 
calls letters of recommendation "unre-
liable. They often hide dullness." He 
has little patience for essays on why a 
student wants to be a lawyer- "it gets 
to be one hundred thousand times 
uplifting society. Your eyes glaze 
over. We took a student last year 
whose GPA was a 3.4. He was a blue-
collar worker who'd worked his way 
through college. He'll be a good 
alumnus. If we had more places to 
play with, we could admit more 
people who hauled up their socks 
after their first year, or people who've 
done interesting things. You know, a 
few more oddballs. Eccentrics often 
do well here. One tried to save New 
Haven

" 

Lanford is pleased with incoming 
classes. "We've 'eliminated' the bot-
tom half of the class statistically, as 
the administration keeps saying. 
We've always been more selective 
than ~a~ard [Lanford's alma mater], 
who elimmated a third of the class 
after the first year by failing them. I 
don't see any dismal conformity here. 
A few students are lemons. An ideal 
first year class wouldn't include the 
five or six goofs we get. 

It's normal to want to duplicate 
yourself unconsciously, I guess," he 
says. He later adds that he likes 
people who have taken a year off, 
because he did. His practicality in-
cludes rationalizing the system of 
having faculty readers instead of a 
full-time admissions staff. "We think 
it makes a difference. The candidate 
feels he gets more attention. Faculty 
reading is good with alumni children 
too." The last point may be the most 
important. "Other than that, random 
selection might give as good a class," 
he says. 

Lanford isn't cold, exactly, but he's 
very businesslike. "I can't think of a 
job I'd like better," he says of 
teachinj. His idea of teacher-student 
relationships corresponds to his 
reason for having liked Harvard: "If 
my teachers left me alone, I'd leave 
them alone." He still thinks "it's more 
pleasant" at Yale than at other 
schools, although he will readily list 
ten other schools that would give as 
good an education. 

"I want good students who will be 
good lawyers," he says. Lanford dis-
likes working on admissions, how-
ever. "I got sweet-talked into reading 
folders. You do need a good mix of 
readers, though. Otherwise the class 
might be stodgier-or nuttier." As I 
leave, he says, "They say Yale and 
Harvard skim off the cream. I like to 
think we skim off the butter." 

Jack Crain, too, is proud of Yale's 
classes. He was head of the admis-
sions committee for several years. At 
first he spot-checked those who were 
rejected. "I didn't fmd anyone who 
had the remotest chance of getting 
in." Crain is brash. He loudly hails 
people who pass by the hall, and 
paces around the room ("I've been 
sitting around all day.") His office 
suggests a locker room, with its 
industrial furniture and scraps of 
paper taped up in odd places. Crain 
strengthens this impression with his 
constant bantering and his coach's 
drivingly frank manner. 

Crain wants a good team made up 
of "top students." For fear of losing 
students to Harvard he moved up 
admission time during his administra-
tion for the best candidates. To find 
out who was really tops, Crain wrote 
to colleges asking for their grading 
curves. "We'd check a Yale 3. 75 
against a Stanford one. Well, it was a 
lot easier to get that GPA from 
Stanford than from Yale, so the 
number of Stanford people we ac-
cepted decreased. We had to explain 
this to the readers, or they might 
make horrendous mistakes . 

.. The problem is fmding out who's 
really brilliant. You can't tell from the 
file. One Yale student was widely 
regarded as brilliant. We had to turn 
him down because another student 
had a better record. His college 
master was angry, but once we 
showed him the records he said he'd 
do the same thing. The student had a 
few bad grades- Bs. A few too many 
Bs among the As can ruin you. More 
grade differentiation would help. I 
mean, how are we supposed to 
know?" 

Like other readers, Crain discounts 
letters. "The paternalistic faculty can't 
bear to be frank, and competes for 
superlatives." Essays? "Some are il-
literate. They can expose the candi-
date immediately. In general they're 
not worth a lot, just 250 words of 
what the candidate thinks the reader 
wants to hear. I know of kids who've 
lied about their interests just to con-
form with fads. I don't put much 
faith in attached papers, either. One 
student plagiarized an article of mine 
and didn't even give me credit in his 
bibliography." 

Crain doesn't agree with tl)e reader-
replication theory. "You have too 
much trouble trying to differentiate 
between the candidates to worry 
about looking for people like your-
self. Students all look so similar. The 
thing you seek most is academic 
potential," Crain says, echoing Gilner. 
"That's the hardest thing to manu-
facture in a file. Other characteristics 
they suppose we're looking for can be 
manufactured easily. 

"The minority policy changes with 
each dean," Crain says. "The present 
process may look like mine. I said 
that we should take students accord-
ing to their academic potential. My 
system," he says pointedly, " was 
good." 

The present Dean is Ted Williams. 
He's the only black on the committee, 
but his position of authority may 
make him count for two. The black 
and the woman on this committee are 
the workhorses, the people who do 
the admissions scutwork. Williams 
must read each folder from beginning 
to end, then decide whether or not to 
pass it on to the other readers. "I 
don't eliminate people. I look for 
people." 

Williams keeps an extremely tight 
schedule. He values his close rapport 
with students (he is in charge of 
student activities), who pop in and 
out of his office as we talk. 

An unusual painting opposite 
Williams' desk, painted by a student, 
shows him as an oracle-like figure to 
whom students offer up diplomas. In 
a photograph over his desk he strides

forward to shake hands with Lyndon 
Johnson. A label underneath com-
memorates the date. He seems a 
young man impressed with the prog-
ress he has made, although it's bard 
to tell where he wants his ambition 
and energy to lead him. 

.. I like someone who's tested him-
self completely, who's stretched his 
limits of thinking," he says, crumpling 
unwanted mail as we talk. "Someone 
who's had the courage to take chal-
lenging courses, although he may 
suffer from it. Someone who takes 
organic chemistry, for instance, al-
though he's not a pre-med. He tackles 
bard courses to get a quality educa-
tion." Williams strove for the same 
thing. He went to college in Iowa and 
came to Yale Law. "A splendid indi-
vidual can come from a poor school," 
be says- adding that expectations for 
achievement will be higher than for 
an Ivy League student. 

Though Williams must read more 
why-I-want-to-be-a-lawyer essays than 
anyone else, he maintains that the 
essay is important. "It's the one thing 
the applicant does for us, and it can 
become a point of distinction. The 
faculty generally shares this view," he 
says optimistically. 

Like everyone, Williams stressed 
the differences among Yale law stu-
dents . .. They're as different as they 
can get, if you expect them to study 
in the same room. Diversity is the 
class's strength. Students are alike 
only in that they're able." Or competi-
tive? Still, Thomas says Yale is more 
"congenial" than other schools- .. but 
you lose none of the intellectual rigor. 
It's a more relaxed place to live." 

The limited number of students in 
each class frustrates Williams, but he 
says "I can overlook my annual dis-
appointments when people I want 
don't get in. I can take the abuse I 
get. It's not like we're turning them 
away. I can't feel very so.-ry for 
someone who must goJ to Harvard." 

.. Relations with students keep me 
going," Williams says. He is unlike 
the faculty readers, who seem not to 
want to see students except in the 
classroom. They are in fact remark-
ably impersonal and academic. They 
want hard brilli2nce. Gilner and 
Crain concentrate on statistics; Lan-
ford calls anyone the least bit uncon-
ventional a .. goof" or, euphemisti-
caJJy, "eccentric." 

The members of the admissions 
staff take a more personal approach, 
but it may be in vain. The lack of 
communication among readers keeps 
alive such iJLusions as Williams' (and 
Hanley's) thinking the essay counts 
for a lot. Their humanity can make 
little difference in the end: they are 
outnumbered. 

The faculty members know what 
they want. Admissions work for them 
is an incidental annoyance. The ad-
missions staff members work harder; 
their turnover rate is high because the 
job is usually one stop on the way to 
something else. The work is too 
frenzied for anyone to last long. "I 
kid my colleagues to glamorize it," 
Williams says ... But trip after trip 
makes me sympathize with political 
campaigners. The work gets hard." 

Williams pauses, looks at the 
ceiling. "Still," he says.
