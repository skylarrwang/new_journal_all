The Mill-in: 
of Berkeley and things to come 
by Michael Mandelbaum 

Michael Mandelbaum, from Berkeley, 
Ctllif., a senior in Yale College, is an 
bu~nsive major in political science. This 
ilhis second appearance in The New 
Journal. 

"One of the most difficult tasks facing t~e 
ChancelJor," according to the Slate Supple-
ment to the General Catalogue, the Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley's widely-
read equivalent of the Yale Course 
Critique, "is that of unifying and infuriat-
ing the students in time for the annual 
Fall STRIKE. We all know how rushed the 
quarter system makes studying, and it bas 
been hard on the Chancellor, too. Al-
though be has been doing a workmanlike 
job, and has even started this task early in 
the summer, he has not yet attained the 
prowess of his predecessors." 

Slate's fears were not borne out. It was 
not even necessary for the University to 
award an honorary degree to Lyndon 
Johnson, Nguyen Cao Ky, or Shirley 
Temple Black, or to name a building after 
the founder of the Dow Chemical Com-
pany, as the Supplement went on to sug-
gest, to ignite a series of disorders which 
have become an annual event on the 
campus since the memorable Free Speech 
Movement of 1964, which was led by 
Mario Savio. These disturbances at Ber-
keley, and those that occured shortly 
afterward across the Bay at San Francisco 
State College, are different from their 
predecessors. The underlying causes and 
the tactics employed are new and disturb-
ing. They bear on the immediate future of 
American student activism, and even of 
American universities themselves. 

Ostensibly, each commotion was a 
response to administrative suspensions, 
issued for allegedly political reasons. In 
Berkeley in early October, students staged 
a large anti-war rally on campus. The 
rally defied a court's injunction, obviously 
designed to stifle protest, which was 
rescinded shortly thereafter. Although he 
disagreed with the injunction, ChancelJor 
Roger Heyns felt obliged to recommend 
that eleven of the rally's organizers be 
suspended. Charging that Heyns sought 
to hinder anti-war activity, and had un-
fairly singled out a few of the several 
thousand who participated in the rally, 
students staged a series of "mill-ins" in 
the administration building. Hundreds of 
students flooded the corridors and offices 
of Sproul Hall. Others kept its telephone 
lines constantly busy, making the normal 
transaction of university affairs impossible. 

San Francisco State is the crown jewel 
of the state college system (distinct from 
the Un\versit)· of California and its several 
campuses), with a reputation for a bright, 
hip student body and an avant-garde cur-
riculum. Several days after the last of the 
Berkeley mill-ins, State spawned its own 
"Movement Against Political Suspen-
sions." 

President John Surnmerskill had sus-
pended four members of the school's 
Black Student Union, who allegedly had 
assaulted the editor of the campus news-
paper. Several weeks later, a campus 
literary magazine printed an erotic poem 
which, Surnmerskill decided, violated an 
agreement made by the magazine's editor. 
He suspended both the editor and the 
poet. A few days later, admitting that his 
action had been premature, Sumrnerskill 
reinstated the two pending an investiga-
tion. Angered by what they considered a 
racially biac;ed double standard. students 
marched on their administration building. 
Finding it locked, they broke several 
windows and climbed in. No further 
damage ""as done there, but during the 
fracas some black non-students reportedly 
set fires in the campus bookstore and 
looted the cafeteria. Simultaneously, a 
number of fights erupted outside the ad-
ministration building. 

Although the immediate object of stu-
dent wrath in each case was the chief 
campus administrator, a fundamental pro-
vocation was the tedious, omnipresent 
war. For the war in Vietnam is finally 
having a marked effect on the most highly 
educated of those who must tight it. Stu-
dents, particularly older ones, are con-
cerned by the very real threat of the draft 
after graduation; they are frustrated by 
the failure of dissent to have any real 
effect upon an implacable national ad-
ministration with a one-track mind; they 
are angry at the duplicity and hypocrisy 
which have characterized the conduct of 
the war. Thus a climate of malaise and 
hostility has been generated at San Fran-
cisco and Berkeley, in which campus dis-
turbances require very little provocation. 

Berkeley and San Francisco also rep-
resent a temporary detour in the course 
of student opposition to the war; an in-
volution-a turning back on the universitf 
itself. This is in part due to the failure 
of all attempts to in.O.uence the forces 
directly responsible for the conflict. Stu-
dents vent their frustrations on the in-
stitutions closest at hand, and upon which 
they can have the most impact. 

The campus is also a relatively safe 
place to protest, particularly for California 
students, one of whom called it "our 
turf." At military induction centers, 
weapons depots, or even in city streets 
they are subject to the vindictive directives 
of General Hershey and the heavy clubs 
and noxious fumes of unsympathetic 
police. The violence visited upon a group 
attempting to stage a peaceful sit-in in 
Oakland on October 17 of last year (New 
Journal, October 29, 1967) was un-
doubtedly traumatic for many in the 
peace movement in California. 

Accompanying this involution is the 
birth of a new set of tactics, which have 
been particularly evident in Berkeley. A 
mill-in is not strictly illegal. It is a viola-
tion of the public order, not the law. In 
common with the entrapment of rep-
resentatives of the Dow Chemical Com-
pany, it foreshadows a shift from a 
strategy of petition and persuasion to one 
of harassment. Instead of merely asking 
that the war be ended and the university 
be changed, students increasingly are at-
tempting to interfere directly with the 
administration of both. Their actions are 
no longer wholly symbolic. 

Most important of all, participants in 
the mill-ins break radically with the 
strategy of civil disobedience and the 
philosophy behind it. An act of civil dis-
obedience must be commited openly, non-
violently, and with a willingness to accept 
the prescribed consequences. As Herbert 
Kelman points out, it is designed for "a 
restoration of the system's legitimacy 
and integrity, and expresses a faith in the 
society's capacity to be true to its own 
values .... " Participants in a mill-io do 
not make such an affirmation of overall 
legitimacy. They do not announce their 
actions openly, they do not commit them-
-;elves ab~lutely to non-violence, and they 
are unwilling to incure punishment. At the 
first sign of police, they quickly disperse. 

Such tactics accurately reflect a growing 
alienation from the entire structure of 
authority in this country, and an erosion 
of the respect and allegiance it bas norm-
ally commanded. 

The parallel to the tactical history of the 
Black Revolution is striking. Berkeley's 
Free Speech Movement in 1964 borrowed 
the sit-in from the black students who 
began to desegregate the South in the 
early 1960's. A shift of framework-in 
one case from the South to the urban 
ghettoes of the North, in the other from 
the issue of the student's role in the uni-
versity to Vietnam-producing frustration 
and anger, fueled by encounters with 
powerlessness and hypocrisy-bas led in 
both cases to guerrilla tactics of disrup-
tion. The next step for students is the 
concerted use of violence, and that is very 
much in the air in Berkeley. 

The events on campus have catalyzed a 
predictably sharp swing to the right in 
California politics. Not only Governor 
Reagan and Superintendent of Public 
Information Max Rafferty, right-wing 
Republicans with an eye on higher office, 
but even State Assembly Speaker Jesse 
Unruh, the most prominent Democrat in 
the state, sensed political fodder in the dis-
turbances and denounced students and 
administrators. Outraged legislators in 
Sacramento called for campus investiga-
tions and reprisals against "subversives." 
The elements which in the early 1950's 
fostered McCarthy ism are again present: 
a distant, ambiguous, indecisive conflict 
and the absence of vigorous national 
leadership to defend civil liberties. They 
create a political climate in which anti-
intellectualism thrives and attacks on the 
universities are profitable. 

Ultimately the price the United States 
pays for the war may well be the disillu-
sionment and alienation of an entire gen-
eration of students. The most immediate 
domestic casualties, however, are likely 
to be the universities, and particularly their 
administrators. At another time, in an-
other place, Roger Heyns and John 
Summers kill, honorable, able men, might 
be heroes. But it is their job to mediate 
between the students and those holding 
political power, and that is no longer 
possible. 

Nor are these gloomy prospects confined 
to California, as similar events at Wis-
consin and Harvard testify. President 
Kingman Brewster noted the absence 
of such disturbances at Yale when be 
appeared on the "David Susskind Show." 
He credits the general restraint of Yale 
students, and in identifying a relatively 
moderate style of political activity on 
this campus he is no doubt correct. But 
if the specter of Vietnam continues to 
haunt this country, his tum will come. •
