minds of several young army officers, and 
on January 15, 1966, they conducted a 
successful coup designed to end the 
feudalistic anachronism and establish a 
truly national government at Lagos. The 
leader of the Northern Region, Sardauna 
of Sokoto, and his Prime Minister at 
Lagos, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, were 
assassinated. 

The North feared this coup as an 
Eastern attempt to gain control of the 
entire federation. lbos were blamed. While 
the officers that led the coup bad members 
of all peoples, a large number were from 
the most nationalistic: Ibo. An lbo became 
head of the Supreme Military Council. 
Major General Aguiyi-Ironsi, born in the 
North, Hausa-speaking, and above all 
dedicated to a united Nigeria, received a 
reputation based on only one charac-
teristic-being an lbo. 

Tensions rose. The lbos living in the 
North ridiculed the death of Sard.auna and 
defiled photographs of him. The abstract 
and non-human terms in which North-
erners spoke of Ibos gained in venom 
and frequency. Stories of lbo greed and 
cunning saturated the North. Rumors of 
lbos smuggling in guns to enslave the 
Nqrth grew malignantly. 

Tensions boiled over on May 24, 1966, 
when to insure national unity Ironsi issued 
a decree abolishing regions entirely. Living 
in Sa bon Gari, the Ibos were easy prey, 
and massacres erupted in five Northern 
cities. 

"Some were decapitated. Others bled to 
death after their arms, legs, and testicles 
were chopped off. Old men and boys had 
their eyes gouged out. Pregnant women's 
bellies were ripped open. Children were 
shot in their parents' presence," wrote 
Claire Sterling in the Reporter (August 10, 
1967). 

Laz lost a cousin in this pogrom. Thou-
sands of Northern Ibos fled to the East. 
The Ibo leader of the Eastern Region, 
Lt. Col. Odumegwu Ojukwu, a dedicated 
nationalist, asked the refugees to go back 
to their jobs in the North. Placing national 
unity first, Ojukwu realized that the North 
would face economic collapse if the Ibos 
who held the vital jobs evacuated. What 
Ojukwu terms the "last act of faith for 
that (nationalist) faith" ended in disaster. 

A counter-coup in July killing Aguiyi-
Ironsi catalyzed another pogrom. Every 
Ibo officer found in the Northern military 
capital was murdered. In this butchery 
Laz lost 210 former classmates. The new 
commander, Yakubu Gowon, symbolized 
the North's regain of control over the 
shreds of a nation. 

Refugees flocked to the East. "A 
woman, mute and dazed, arrived back in 
her village after traveling for five days 
with only a bowl in her lap. It held the 
head of her child, severed before her eyes. 
Another woman steped off a refugee lorry, 
her face battered. By her side was her little 
boy, one of whose eyes had been gouged 
out, and her little girl who had severe 
scalp wounds. 'What,' she kept repeating, 
'has haP.pened to my baby?' It had been 
tied to her back before she was knocked 
to the ground," wrote Colin Legum of 
the exodus (Africa Reports, November, 
1966). 

The pattern of federal unity had become 
a scattered jigsaw puzzle. In an emergency 
conference in September, 1966, Gowon 
made a last-ditch effort to piece it together. 
He proposed a loose association of 
autonomous states, economically inter-
dependent and joined by customs unions 
and public services. All parties united, 
ephemerally. For unknown reasons the 
North abandoned the proposals after its 
own leader had proposed them. The once 
bright hope of a united Nigeria dimmed 
a shade more. 

The remaining Ibos in the North were 
hunted down and maimed or murdered f 
on September 29, 1966, in a third pogrom 
actively led by Northern police and 
troops. Schools and hospitals associated 
with Ibos were sack~d and destroyed. 

But the dim hope of a united Nigeria 
Sl 
had not yet been extinguished. In the fint 
days of 1967, leaders from all factions llll! It
in Aburi, Ghana, in an astoundingly sue· 
A
cessful conference. Gowon agreed to 
n: 
finance the resettlement of lbo refugees, 
f2 
and all sides agreed to the loose economic 
pr 
association previously proposed. 

Again the glimmer of hope was to be 
l'
doused. The senior officers of the NoJ;then 
1'1 
civil service, more interested in immediatt p
benefits than a viable federation, opposed 
L
these proposals, known as the Aburi 
ll 
Agreements. Controlling all federal powr~ D
at Lagos, they showed reluctance to yield 
11
it. While Gowon's control over his bureatt J
crats may have been more than nominal, 
a
it was not strong enough. Reneging upon 
the A buri Agreements in March, 1967, 
tl 
the federal government extinguished all 
r 
hope of a united Nigeria. 

The East, now well acquainted with 
f 
disappointment, stood ready to act and 
I
seceded. Thinking that the war, which 
broke out shortly thereafter, would take 
a week to crush, Gowon obviously had 
no conception of the fierce Biafran espiri~ 
for the war rages on today. Biafrans fight 
for an idea as well as for their very exist-
ence: a combination not eastly over-
whelmed by larger numbers or better 
equipment. 

"This is a popular and patriotic war, 
waged by people who feel that their sur: 1 
vi val is quite literally at stake .... A nattoo 
has been bqrn and will in some form 
endure. There is reality about the birth 
of Biafra," wrote Conor Cruise O'Brien 
in the Observer (October 8, 1967). 

"As long as there is one living Biafran,· 
Laz said, "there will be a Biafra." 

The British are the most culpable of 
aU parties. They support federal troops 
to frustrate the emergence of African 
intelligence. Henderson thinks the British 
prefer a docile, tradition-oriented, depen· 
dent people to an independent, educated, ~ 
self-assertive people who might compete • 
with business interests. They not only 
condone, but actively support the whole-
sale slaughter of an entire race to promote 
selfish economic interests. Britain isolates 
the most Western-oriented nation in 
Africa. 

Only one more in a long list of tragic 
ironies is that Britain finds herself on 
the same side as the Soviet Union, which 
aids the Lagos government as a natural 
extension of Arab bloc support. 

. 
The worst aspect of Britain's position IS 
that it prevents her aUies from aiding 
Biafra. With Russia and all Moslem coun-
tries supporting Lagos the only side that 
could support Christian Biafra is silenced. 
While the United States is diplomaticallY 
obligated to be neutral, genocide some· 
how seems at least as important as 
neutrality. Henderson and other memberS~ 
of the Committee for Biafran Refugees 
have appealed to the State Department to 
take a more active part in attempting to 
end the violence. The official response ha5 
been that any U.S. efforts to encourage 
negotiations would be rejected as inter· 
ference in Nigeria's internal affairs and 
MID unfriendly act. With British and 
1 
Soviet aid pouring into Lagos, the charge 
:t ofiDterference would seem to be little 
more than a semantic game. But since 
Britain is her closest ally, the U.S. is in an 
e embarrassingly touchy situation. And, of 
coune, there's Vietnam. 

ll 3 
1be press performed a disservice to 
lbe American people and an abominable 
iajuatice to the Biafrans in covering the 
nr. For the ultimate existence of the 
lbol may hang upon the feelings of the 
American people. Today few Americans 
realize there is a war in which 14 million 
flee death, and that is the fault of the

When hostilities erupted, the New 
Yorl Times had reporters in both 
er. Nileria and Biafra. Understanding the 
It! 
pliabt of the lbos, the Biafran reporter, 
id 
Lloyd Garrison, wrote, "Like a beleagured 
faoael, Biafra will fight back. It will have 
ffS aothing to lose. For the Ibo it will be 
d 
lllrYival or death" (New York Times, 
11!-
J~me4, 1967). Garrison was withdrawn 
caJuly 21 and not replaced. So ended 
Ill)' aemblance of balanced coverage in 
tbeNew York Times. The remaining 
reporter in Lagos, Alfred Friendly Jr., 
ICCOrding to Henderson "swallowed the 
fedenJ position whole." Friendly, 
Heoderson believes, was contained by the 
federal government at Lagos and was 
IIDible to do much more than rewrite that 
~&Wemment's hand-outs. 

Friendly remains the only Times re-
parter in Nigeria. In at least one instance, 
lbe Times reported the fall of a Biafran 
town to federal troops when it was still in 
Biafran control. Some very recent articles, 
bo.ever, suggest that Friendly is 
'-~inning to become disaffected with the 
federal side. 

-r'ime seems to be running out for 
tbe ~eeessionist lbo regime," began a 
Tllltes editorial of August 6. Yet on 
Auaust 13 the Times expressed dis-
appointment that federal troops weren't 
"'iibtening the noose" fast enough and 
Cbat Biafrans were taking the offensive. 

Upset at this coverage, Henderson 
wrote Graham Hovey, a member of the 
Tlllte.r' editorial board who deals with 
II 
African affairs, accusing him of "dis-
a-
flartin& a complex situation in which a 
'Wily large number of human lives are at 
• llake." Since an interchange of ideas 
between Henderson and Hovey, the 
editorial position of the Times has 
e 
'.'Ofved to the point of urging negotia-
s 
lioaa, while still opposing any form of 
lleaaion. 

On Thanksgiving Day Laz and 100 
fellow Biafrans demonstrated in front of 
the New York Times editorial offices to 
PIOteat the Timrs' treatment of the war. 
Siace that day there has been no editorial 
llleluion of the war. 

Tbe Times' distortion results from 
Clrryiog the rational amoral ism of 
IIOliti<:s too far. "Biafra cannot win. The 
ltiatran.s simply must give up secession and 
Deeotiate for a highly autonomous East 
Central State," said Graham Hovey in a 
!dePphone interview last week. While in a 
3.11( &arne of Diplomacy this would be 
.._correct move, it fails to take into 
IOQount the personal determination of a 
....... 
-.":Jbere are no conditions for reuniting. 
•• two countries can never be one 
.-," said Laz. "This is not just my 
leetini.It is the dedication of 14 million 
Plaple who are fighting for their lives." •
