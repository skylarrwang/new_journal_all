The director's event: 
interview with Arthur Penn 
by Robert Edelstein and 
Martin L. Rubin 

Robert Edelstein, a senior in Yale College 
and chairman of the Yale Film Society, 
directed Sally's Hounds, shown at Yale 
last fall, and is presently working on a 
new film, The Girl with No Name. 

Martin Rubin, a junior in Yale College, 
is vice president-treasurer of the Yale 
Film Society. 

The release of Bonnie and Clyde has con-
firmed Arthur Penn as the most talented 
American film director to emerge in the '60's, 
clearly outdistancing such other aspirants as 
Stanley Kubrick (Dr. Strange/ave), Mike 
Nichols (The Graduate), Robert Mulligan 
(Up the Down Staircase), or Sidney Lumet 
(The Pawnbroker). 

Like most recent film-makers, Penn started 
out in the perilous training grounds of New 
York television and theater. Working mostly 
with producer Fred Coe, his early TV experi-
ence included "The Colgate Comedy Hour" 
and "First Person." H is first major theater 
production was William Gibson's Two for the 
Seesaw in 1957. At this time, he and Coe 
became interested in Gibson's The Miracle 
Worker, which resulted in the successful 
"Playhouse 90" production and, later, a long-
run Broadway show, directed by Penn. Other 
notable plays Penn has directed on Broadway 
include Toys in the Attic, All the Way Home, 
An Evening with Nichols and May, Golden 
Boy and Wait Until Dark. His previous films 
include The Left-handed Gun (1959), The 
Miracle Worker (1961), Mickey One (1965) 
and The Chase (1965). 

Bonnie and Clyde (1967) has been, except 
for the pathetic dissent of Bosley Crowther, 
the most critically acclaimed film of the year. 
Thr interview which follows centers mainly 
on this film. Despite the critical attention it 
has received, the film has been largely mis-
interpreted. We hope that this interview will 
clear up some of these misconceptions, most 
notably those of critics who insist that the 
film is an attempted recreation of the Dust 
Bowl era and/or the story of a budding AI 
Capone and his bloodthirsty moll. It should be 
noted that the themes and style of Bonnie and 
Clyde were developed in Penn's previous four 
films, and this interview touches upon them to 
illustrate that point. In short, Bonnie and 
Clyde bears more relation to The Left-Handed 
Gun than to either The Grapes of Wrath or 
Little Caesar. 

Penn, now forty-five years old, is pre-
paring the script for his next film, Little Big 
Man, based on the novel by Thomas Berger. 
He bas planned no other projects beyond this 
one. He continues to direct in theater, al-
though the disastrous experience of How Now, 
Dow Jones has made him wary of Broadway, 
and he will be running the Berkshire Play-
house in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, this 
summer. This interview was conducted at 
Penn's office on Broadway in November, 
1967, three months after the release of 
Bonnie and Clyde. 

I n your films, you seem to be concerned 
with individuals who want to shape their 
lives in their own way, outside of society. 
Yet these characters come to violent, 
tragic ends. Aren't you concerned about 
any other character types? 

I would say, almost categorically, that 
the only people who really interest me 
are the outcasts from society. The 
people who are not outcasts--either 
psychologically, emotionally, or 
physically-seem to me to be subject 
for material for buying breakfast food, 
but they're not subject for material for 
films. 

My characters don't always end 
violently, if you bear in mind that Helen 
Keller figures in this configuration of 
outcasts. Quite the reverse happens. 
What I'm really trying to say through 
the figure of the outcast is that a society 
has its mirror in its outcasts. A society 
would be wise to pay attention to the 
people who do not belong in it in order 
to find out what Its configuration is and 
where it's falling. 

In The Chase and in Bonnie and Clyde, at 
least, the fates of these characters seem to 
get progressively darker . They seem more 
and more hopeless in their ability to make 
these lives which they wish to lead last .... 

Well, I don't think there's anything like 
an even battle between the outcast and 
his society. It isn't an even battle at all. 
What I really am sensing Is that this is 
the only fight these people can fight. 
The odds are clearly against them as, I 
think, the odds are clearly against the 
Negro in the civil rights movement 
today. The odds have always seemed 
to be, as far as I can figure, against 
the people who seem to be on the 
right side. 

In a certain sense, it's a kind of 
revolutionary position. I mean to say, 
my sympathies lie with that man or 
woman who's outside society and 
cannot accommodate himself to it and 
may have to lose his life in order to 
change that society. 

Towards the end of Bonnie and Clyde, 
Bonnie tells Clyde that she's "got the 
blues," that at one point she had thought 
they were "going somewhere,'' and now 
she wonders if they are going anywhere. 
Are they? 

No. I'm not holding up Bonnie and 
Clyde as particularly Interesting out-
casts nor as outcasts who have an 
intention or a continuing motivating 
line. I don't think they did. I think they 
were wandering, hopeless people. 

But I think it was a wandering, hope-
less time. The time Itself didn't know 
where it was going. It was a peculiarly 
naive time, horrible as It was. The 
Depression was peculiarly naive. The 
banks did naive things. They foreclosed 
as many farms as they possibly could, 
leaving the land without anyone to 
farm it, which promptly broke the 
banks. 

Everyone seemed to have a sense of 
destination, and yet when they came 
to confront their lives, the discovery 
was that the sense of destination had 
departed. They found they were simply 
engaged in acting out whatever roles 
they had set in motion originally. 

In the film, it was very Important for 
me to have at least Bonnie understand 
that she was no longer acting out of 
the early promises of Clyde like, " I'm 
going to dress you up, and we're going 
to go to the fanciest restaurants." 
There was no longer that, and they 
were down to a very threadbare basis. 
This was, however, her only place for 
existence-with him and in doing 
these things. She was perfectly willing 
to accept that, knowing that death was 
implicit in it and liable to come at any 
time. In that sense, it was an existential 
realization, and it was an important 
one forme. 

These outcasts are often f am ous criminal!. 
01 
such as Billy the Kid and Bonnie and 
Clyde, and they seem to attract hero-
worshippers. I'm thinking particularly of 
I'
lr
the Hurd H atfield character in L eft-
H anded Gun and C. W. Moss in Bonnie 
and Clyde. Why should criminals become 
idols? 

I think that outcasts who become 
prominent immediately have satellite& 
who idolize them. It Is In a certain sente 
a part of the bizarre character of the 
world that these outcasts find their 
111
historians and documentarians in thea 
s1 
idolators.

In the character of Hurd Hatfield in 
Lett-Handed Gun,* I was really trying 
to say that he was constantly con-
fronted with a myth that he contained 
in his head about who Billy the Kid .was. 
His grave disappointment at who Billy 
the Kid actually was in fact and his 
inability to reconcile those two caused 
him eventually to betray Billy. 

It was the need to have heroes be 
genuinely heroic that seems to me to 
be an absurdity and a foolish Intention, 
and when somebody like the Hatfield 
character is failed In that, there's no 
end to his retaliation, no limit to his 
revenge.

c
C. W. Moss does not fall in the same 
category. C. W. Moss was really a fel· 
low without Imagination to whom that 
people brought one little bit of I magi"" 
tion and romance, and he was p erfectlY 
willing and grateful to have that in his 
t1
life. 

When he goes along with his father 
in setting up the ambush, I took that to 
mean that he was really testing h is 
fantasy of these people to its limit, In 
his utter belief that they would really 
walk on water and be able to elude 
any ambush that his pedestrian father 

*Penn's first film, The Left-Handed Gun 
(1959), a unique rendering of the myth of 
Billy the Kid, was initially received coldlY . 
in this country but was critically successful Ill 
Europe. In the film, Billy (Paul Newman), a 
childlike outlaw, is befriended by a lcindlY 
Scottish cattleman. When the Scotsma.n is 
murdered, Billy tracks down the killers and 
brutally avenges the death of his friend. He 
is protected by Pat Garrett and a Mexican 
blacksmith. He alienates both of them by 
disrupting the former's wedding and sleepin! 
with the latter's wife. BiUy is finally betrayed 
by an itinerant huckster (Hurd H atfield) wbO ; 
had once idolized him. Trapped, Billy for¢ 
Pat Garrett to shoot him by drawing on an 
empty holster and dies suicidally. In this firSI 
film, Penn's preoccupation with physical 
violence and his flair for striking visual 
effects which seem to miraculously stay on 
the right side of obviousness are already 
clearly apparent.
