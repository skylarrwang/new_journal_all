**Title: Beleaguered Biafra and the threat of genocide**
**Author: Jonathan Lear**
**Page number(s): 3**

The final chords of Handel's Judas Maccabaeus resonated through Woolsey Hall proclaiming the triumph of the persecuted Israelites. Lazarus Ekwueme left his place in the choir and walked the single, snowy black back to his one-room apartment next to George and Harry's.

This particular oratorio had struck a personal note with Laz, a graduate student in music, who has been away from his African home for two years now. It filled him with the thoughts of his people-the lbos. "We are the Jews of Africa," Laz said after the concert. "We have so much in common with the Jews: ambition, love of education, pride ... and persecution."


Genocide is imminent for the eight million Ibos that are his people. Some of the leading powers of the world actively support the forces inflicting the genocide; the American press indirectly lends support to those forces; the American government refuses to take any position; and the American people are largely unaware of the helpless condition of an entire people facing annihilation.


When I met Laz shortly after the Woolsey Hall concert, the muscles in his face were tight and his speech abrupt. Trying to ask an innocuous question that would ease tension, I made my first faux pas. I asked where his home was located in Nigeria.

"I am not from Nigeria," he said. "I am from Biafra. I am a Biafran."


Newspapers and diplomats insist on calling it Nigeria, but the region is wracked by a civil war so intense, so divisive, so bloody, that it is doubtful a united Nigeria in any old sense of the word will ever exist again. Thirty thousand lbos who lived in the North of Nigeria lost their lives in a series of pogroms in 1966. An additional two million Ibos fled the pogroms in a mass exodus to the East, the home of their population.


On the first anniversary of the Northern Pogrom, after the federal government reneged on agreements which might have mended the nation, the Eastern Region seceded from Nigeria. The Republic of Biafra was born on May 29, 1967. Civil war followed shortly. The federal government, with its capital at Lagos, expected to crush the rebels within a week. They did not anticipate Biafran determination: the war is still being waged.


The federal troops seem intent on eliminating the 14 million people (eight million of them Ibos) who call themselves Biafrans. While all major nations conduct diplomatic relations with the federal government, no nation has yet recognized Biafra. Britain and Russia, strange bedfellows, actively support and equip the federal government.


The attitude of the West was ironically revealed in my second faux pas. I asked Laz about the lbo tribe.

"I resent the word tribe as it is applied to the Ibos," he said. "We are a people, a nation. After all, no one talks about the Anglo-Saxon tribe or the German tribe."


In a year Laz will have his Ph.D. in music theory. His older brother has an M.A. in town planning; his younger brother is an English-educated surgeon; his friends in Biafra are all similarly educated. And I ask about his tribe.


The devastating war in Nigeria is condoned, ignored or even supported by the West because it is only black Africans against black Africans. Were there fifty white missionaries whose lives were in danger, the reaction would hardly be the same. Had the exodus of Ibos to Biafra occurred along an internationally recognized boundary it would have been considered one of the world's great refugee problems. Because Biafra is not recognized, however, its two million refugees are passed off as a "domestic problem."


But the reddening eyes and occasional tears that accompanied Laz's descriptions of the war remind one that human deaths are something more than the box scores of a baseball game in an unfamiliar league. Since no mail can get through, Laz has no idea whether his parents are alive or dead. Any letter that is smuggled out of Biafra always carries news of death.


Laz learned from a smuggled letter he received this fall that Northern soldiers had built a fire with books from a school in which he had studied, and had roasted chickens. The books symbolized the education valued by Biafrans. By destroying the books the soldiers felt they were destroying Biafran power.


His fianc√©e, Vicki, whom he left at home so that she could finish her college education, just graduated summa cum laude; and he cannot even send her an application to graduate school.

"Vicki is stuck in the country," he said. "And I am stuck outside, which is even worse."


Laz spends most of his waking hours gathering support for Biafra and funds for Biafran refugees. The International Student Center is sponsoring a fundraising show on March 2, in which Biafran students will perform. He hopes to unite concerned members of the Yale community who could act as a lobbying force on the government and the press to end the carnage.


The plight of the Biafran student in America is one which Laz, as president of the Biafran Students of Connecticut, is trying to ease. Since no mail leaves a blockaded Biafra, Biafran students have been cut off from family funds, and all Nigerian fellowships to Biafrans have been revoked. One of Laz's close friends at Columbia Medical School was forced to drop out and take temporary employment.


In spite of the constricting financial problems, the Biafran students in Connecticut, under Laz's leadership, donated $475 for medical aid to Biafran refugees.

"You'd be surprised how little our finances here are a problem compared with the problem back home," said Laz. "I don't even know how many of my relatives are alive; I only know I will never see all of them again. If one can't go to med school, okay, so he'll get a job and earn some money to send to Biafra. This is the spirit."


On July 31, 1967, a letter appeared in the New York Times, the first in the American press to cry out against the genocide in Nigeria. The author was Richard N. Henderson, an assistant professor of anthropology at Yale who teaches African anthropology. From 1960, when Nigeria became independent, until 1962, Henderson was in that country studying urban structure and the impact of European and American culture. Henderson observed the movement from "Nigeria's brightest hopes to the first signs of danger." He also saw the large role the educated and skilled lbos played in the life of Nigeria. The aggressive, self-assertive orientation of the lbo permeated Onitsha, the town in which he lived.


In his letter to the Times in July, 1967, Henderson wrote that all those who had hopes for Nigeria were appalled at the threat of disintegration. However, he went on to say that legalistic arguments about the unity of Nigeria should not override humanitarian requirements. As the most educated people in Nigeria, the Biafrans provided before the pogroms the real basis for national identity; but the "murderous rampages" on the lbos and the backing out of agreements ironically forced the most nationalistic people to secede. The federal government had exterminated all Biafran faith in the federation. The only possible solution, said Henderson, was the immediate demonstration by "concrete acts" that the federal government is concerned with the welfare and civil rights of the Biafrans.


Henderson's letter provided a flag around which other concerned scholars rallied. An "Appeal for a Cease-Fire in Nigeria," drafted by 13 scholars and missionaries, warned that the entrance of federal troops into the East (Biafra) involved a real danger of genocide. The letter said an immediate cease fire was urgently necessary, and it implored Britain, Russia, and the United States, the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity to act to end the hostilities.


These scholars later formed a Committee for Biafran Refugees with Conor Cruise O'Brien, Albert Schweitzer Professor of Humanities at NYU, as the leading spokesman. Presently they are collecting donations for medical aid to Biafra through the National Council of Churches in New York.


The appeals of the scholars have made clear that no one group can be blamed for the tragic situation in Nigeria. The war is the culmination of a complex history of grievances and hatreds among peoples. Attempting to assign ultimate blame is not only fatuous but also hinders negotiations for a peaceful solution.


The events leading to the war are indeed a complex interweaving of nationalist movements restrained by feudal jealousies. Divided through history by suspicion and hatred, these people of Nigeria were grouped in a federation by a handful of British colonialists, who arbitrarily drew lines on a map of Africa with no regard for cultural or historical unity.


With Nigerian Independence in 1960 the three main language groups of Nigeria, Hausa of the North, Yourba of the West and Ibo of the East entered an increasingly hostile game of king of the mountain for control of the federal government.


None of the groups could control the government alone. Coalitions formed and re-formed, but the Hausa North, with the larger population and territory, always dominated. The Eastern and Western sectors took turns at being excluded.


The lbos in this period were forced to assume the classic role of a minority group. Trade-oriented, valuing education and maintaining strong kinship networks, the lbos became identified as somehow more clever and sly than most. The hatred of the other peoples was vented on the Ibos, and they were blamed for all social malaise. In the Hausa-dominated North the two million lbos, forced to live in ghettos called Sabon Gari (stranger's quarters), were still the most nationalistic group in Nigeria.

"Ibos did not think of themselves only as Ibos, but also as Nigerians," said Henderson.

The spark of nationalism ignited the
