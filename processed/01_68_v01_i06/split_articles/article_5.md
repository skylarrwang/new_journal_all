**Title: Comment: faculty support for Coffin, glitter on Yale's party scene, and a close look at We Bombed in New Haven.**

A letter of support for the Rev. William S. Coffin is now circulating among Yale faculty members. It states that the signers of the letter are convinced that Rev. Coffin "has acted out of the strongest sense of moral responsibility in protesting the war in Vietnam, and that he has chosen his methods of protest only after careful and anguished reflection."


The 500-word letter states that the "great majority of signers of this statement share Mr. Coffin's conviction that our military involvement in Vietnam is profoundly wrong"; but it makes clear that it is more concerned with the indictment as a symbol of "tragic heightening of the domestic costs of the Vietnam War." In particular, it warns of the danger to a democracy when citizens are forced "to choose between their obligation to the law of their country and their moral obligation to themselves and their fellow citizens."


The letter also warns that the "vague and shadowy charge of conspiracy" may be used in the future to silence those who examine and discuss the issue of conscience.


Sponsors of the letter include Law School dean Louis Pollak; law professors Alexander Bickel, Elias Clark, Abraham Goldstein; political science professors James Barber and Robert Dahl; psychiatry department chairman Theodore Lidz; psychiatry professor Robert Lifton; psychology professor William Kessen; associate professor of molecular biophysics Robert Wilhelm; and history professor C. Vann Woodward.


Faculty who wish to sign the statement are asked to return a signed card to the office of James Barber, 202 Hall of Graduate Studies.


Another statement supporting Rev. Coffin was signed by 14 faculty members who aided in the turning in of draft cards or turned in their own cards on October 21 in Washington. The signers say that since the "Administration has chosen to accelerate the war," they feel "yet more strongly that it is not only our right but is our duty to protest this war and stand by those courageous young men who have done so by refusing the draft." The statement "reaffirms the position of last October and reaffirms our solidarity with each other."


One who will probably not sign any such statements is Yale President Kingman Brewster, who somewhat ominously commented after the indictment was announced: "I have made it clear on several occasions that I think draft resistance and its advocacy as a political tactic is ineffective, unwise and improper. Respect for due process of law, however, requires that anyone who is accused is presumed to be innocent until he is found guilty under a Constitutionally valid law. Therefore the fact of indictment itself does not warrant any change in Mr. Coffin's status at Yale."


Glitter

Carl Reiner did not wear his toupee.
"Ruthie, it was him, I swear. He just looks less hairy."


But Paul Newman did wear his shoes.
"Last time I saw Paul and Joanne, they were at the Copa in Miami. Paul was wearing black tie and his usual black socks. No shoes. It was very formal. Paul hates to wear shoes."


What an evening, December 4, opening night of Joseph Heller's We Bombed in New Haven, in the Yale University Theater. Except for Kenneth Haigh and his sleek friend, the sophisticates on the first two rows of the balcony almost broke their necks leaning and gawking over the edge. Strangers spoke to strangers.
"Who's Heller talking to now? Hermione Gingold?"
"Someone said Mike Nichols is here."
"I hear Clive Barnes and Walter Kerr are in the second row."
"Lady, I wouldn't recognize Clive Barnes if I sat on him. I'm looking for Paul Newman's bald spot."


Intermission came and everybody crowded down for a better view. Three first-year acting students stood on the packed stairs and reported: "Paul is now walking out of the auditorium. He chews his gum with the whole left side of his face. Good news, folks. He's not as short as you've been told. He wears a fitted grey double-vent suit. He is tanned. He is beautiful. He shimmers. He is walking outside into the air with his wife, Joanne Woodward. No, she is not wearing a wig. They're going back inside. Quick, look, or you'll miss him. That's all, folks, he's gone."


After the play, everyone came to the party in the Trumbull College dining room. In the beginning no one could move. Rumors of liquor and hors d'oeuvres at some far corner swept through the crowd.
"Arthur Schlesinger is here."
"Yes, I know. There he is," said a girl, unfortunately pointing to host Ronald Dworkin, master of Trumbull, who was deep in conversation with Frederic March.
"Celebrities always stick together," the girl added with some bitterness.
"Isn't that Robert Osborn with the white hair talking to John Hersey and his wife? I told him I loved reading the Vulgarians, and he told me he didn't write it," sighed Estelle Parsons, twisting her handkerchief.
"He wasn't telling the truth, was he?"


At the party, Newman sat with his own party by the door. The former Yale Drama School student drank beer, chewed gum, and practiced the fine art of not looking at five thousand people who were looking at him. His was the only group sitting, and he sat with his back to the crowd.
"Hey, listen, I went right up to him and said, if I don't do it now, I'll never do it."
"Yeah, yeah, what did he say?"
"Then I said, my name is Henry Winkler, and I'm a first-year acting student and did you do any editing or cutting for Cool Hand Luke. I asked if he had anything to do with that last awful sequence of Luke smiles."
"He shook my hand and said, pleased to meet you and said, no, I just acted and split."
"Betsy, where is Truman Capote?" asked a professor.
"Truman didn't invite us, so we didn't invite him," said Betsy Dworkin.
"The play? Oh, of course the play is great. Everyone says so. All the people who look like people you should recognize, they're big Broadway types. They love it. Heller's got a bit."
"Mr. Heller, I think you have a bit."
"Oh, yeah. Good. Meet my daughter Erica. I gotta run."
"Well, confidentially, I never thought he'd make it," said Erica.
"Who? Make what?"
"My father. I never thought he'd make it through the production. Didn't he look crazy when they made him come up on stage for a curtain call? He'll be impossible to live with after all this."
"I think the liquor is going to run out before I find out which one is Kurt Vonnegut," mourned a graduate student whose moustache was soaked with good Scotch.
"Look, give up. Bill Styron is here someplace," answered his friend, "and all my girl wants to do is stand here by the door and watch Paul Newman. She won't even talk to him. Just makes me stand here watching her watch Paul Newman."
"Bob and I had 27 people to dinner tonight, and all of a sudden Bob says, have to get over to Batten for services. Twenty-seven people and opening night and he has to go over for the protest," Norma Bruster laughed ruefully to Reverend Coffin.
"Jim, you mean you actually asked him for his autograph? You're crazy. You're drunk. What did he say?"
"He said the same thing to me that he said to the girl who asked him before I did. He said Jesus Christ I oughta smash your face in or something like that."
"Let me see what he wrote-Best Wishes to Mary, Paul Newman. Well, he signed it, all right."
"Look, he's leaving."


And then Paul Newman showed that the actor, even the star, can still use a good director. For his finale, he strained for the nonchalance of the ringleader, the tough kid who knows, and has to pretend he doesn't, that everybody's watching and waiting for him to show how cool he is. Newman picked up an unopened Budweiser, pulled his custom-tailored gray pants away from his custom-tailored stomach, and slipped the can down into the front of his pants. Then he grinned. And everybody saw that he wasn't really that tough guy. He was just some rich kid sneaking free booze away from a deb party in Westport.


But he didn't lose the crowd. They still loved him. After all, it was a hip move. He could get a whole can of beer just for the asking. He was Paul Newman. Anyway, he was killing himself for the effect. The can was cold.

Bombed

Joseph Heller's first assault upon the stage was a welcome step toward the engaging contemporary drama that Yale's resident audience has been led to expect, though not to find, at the new Repertory Theater. The December performance was a contrast to the earlier, uninspired presentation of a "classic" work which gained nothing from the meeting of the two perspectives of past and present-a confrontation that can so easily result in no perspective at all. The company still needs better overall scripts, but it is certainly now fair to say that it deserves them. The group handled the play with as much competence and imagination as could be expected of any company in the United States. Mr. Arrick continued on page 14
