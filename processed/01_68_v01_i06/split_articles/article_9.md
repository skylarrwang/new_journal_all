desk In a very particular way, or fire a 
gun In a very particular way in order 
for It to be meaningful. 

I studied with Michael Chekhov, who 
was a great believer in the "psychologi-
cal gesture." This is the sense that an 
actor can achieve a good deal of the 
psychology of his character by assum-
Ing some of the physical, external 
aspects of that character. 

I've found this works and I use It 
rather frequently. ! think Warren's limp 
was a very important factor in the 
formation of the character of Clyde ••. 
the dialect, the whole gait. For 
Instance, Warren always wore that gun 
under his jacket. Whether it was ever 
intended in the scene or not, it was 
always there. He never played a scene 
without it, never, because he felt it was 
so much a part of his character. And 
it did make his suit fit in a certain way; 
it made him stand in a certain way. 

I think It does have peripheral benefits 
that we may not be conscious of, but 
they do help convey character. 

Does this visual factor affect you very 
strongly in casting your roles? 

Oh yes, sure. And why not have 
attractive people? I must say I've come 
a long way. When I first started out, I 
felt films had to be about really 
ordinary-looking people. But by God, 
they're not ordinary; they're sixty feet 
high. That's one incontrovertible fact 
about movie screen, and somebody 
not very attractive and sixty feet tall is 
really ugly. 

How much freedom do you give your 
actors? 

Well, it's always relative. What we try 
to do is to create the climate of 
accident, of controlled accident. 
Thafs really the essence of it. 

Certain things I will set very 
meticulously. Other things I will not 
only set, but I will alter them from take 
to take so as to throw the actors off. 

For Instance, although they're sitting 
in chairs, on the next take maybe one 
chair leg will be a little shorter than 
the others. Something will happen In 
order to cause them to say, "Jesus 
Christ, I'm doing a shot, but at the same 
time this chair doesn't • . • "They have 
to deal with that fact. It's by way of 
taking them unaware, with some of 
the physical conditions of living, that 
I try to create these accidents. 

How closely do you work with your 
cameraman? 

I set up every shot in the sense that 
I pick the location of the camera, the 
lens, and what It should contain. The 
cameraman (now we're talking mostly 
about Hollywood cameramen) then 
t.akes over and lights that shot. That's 
what their function is: lighting. It's not 
camera movement or camera composi-
tion. And it was at that level that we 
had some philosophical disagreements 
about what the character of a frame 
should be. I'm now talking about 
cameramen other than the last one; I 
don't mean that to be true of Guffey 
(Burnem Guffey, cameraman for 
Bonnie and Clyde). Guffey was the first 
camerrnan I found who, although he 
disagreed with me, at least allowed me 
the belief that there might be some-
thing to what I was saying--how much 
light we could really cut off from a 
scene and still have a scene and how 
light had to be relatively unified in 
source. 

You see, so much has been going 
on in terms of technological change 
in Hollywood. The character of film 
Is so much better; It's so much faster. 
The lenses are so much faster; the 
developing process is so much better. 

On the other hand, the Hollywood 
cameramen are the same cameramen 
who took us from the days of the silent 
film to now. They are men of sixty-five 
or sixty-six who have not really yet 
recognized viscerally the character 
of the material they're working with. 
They take that light meter, and they 
know they've got a lot of light, but 
they'll put a little more light in there 
and a little more light ••. and pretty 
soon you're Inundated. 

Guffey was very malleable in that 
respect, and I have a high regard for 
him. I have to say he was not always 
with belief or conviction, but he was 
perfectly willing to try it. And very 
often he was gentlemanly enough 
upon seeing the stuff in the dailies to 
say, " My God, that's better than I 
thought. I really didn't think it would 
work, but It did." In that regard, I have 
a sizable estimation of him. 

What do you th ink of the telephoto lens? 
You use it to great effect in Bonnie and 
Clyde. 

Great lens! I'm going to use it more. 
I just have to use it more. I've really 
got the appetite for it. That Is 
something else! We haven't really used 
that at all. I'm really going to use that 
now. Oh boy, that was one of the best 
experiences I've had. 

You're talking about the pan down 
the Arcadia street (to the shot of C. W.'s 
father and Sheriff Hamer sitting in the 
ice cream parlor). That was meat and 
potatoes, meat and potatoes. There 
was a great deal of head-shaking and 
breast-beating about that shot. They 
said, " A 400mm shot! It'll shake, and 
nothing's going to have any depth of 
field •. .' And all the while I kept saying, 
"Yeah, tell me more, tell me more," 
and, by God, it came out looking just 
the right way. Of course lit's 
sensational dramatically! 

At a certain point, there's a certain 
dramatic event that's only two-
dimensional, and anything else is a 
lie. In this kind of schematic betrayal, 
we weren't Interested In what they 
were specifically saying or what they 
were doing or what was going on. 

It was a pure act, a human act, and it 
should have been as two-dimensional 
as It's possible to get. If I had my 
choice, I'd go back and shoot It on an 
800mm lens, right now. 

It's a very exciting lens, particularly 
to intercut with. Everybody keeps 
saying you can't intercut with It, but 
the reverse, I think, is absolutely true. 
You not only can intercut with it, but 
should. The changes In visual 
experience between that and a lens 
with a great depth of field Is just 
marvelous! I will probably end up using 
that lens a great deal more, maybe 
twenty times more than I have so far. 
I'm already seeing my next picture 
with so many scenes visualized in 
that way. 

Given yc•ur initial story, do you thing you 
see the film very much in terms of the 
shots that go into it? 

What I've discovered is: when I've 
known what I was doing, in Left-handed 
Gun and Bonnie and Clyde, I saw the 
whole movie. Those are the only two 
movies I ever did see before I went to 
a screening. I now have to recognize 
this as a symptom in myself: If I can't 
see it in my mind's eye, something is 
wrong. Something is wrong. Something 
is wrong at least for me, and I will be 
alert to the fact in the future. 

Do you use a Jot of takes in a given scene? 

Yes, I use a Jot of takes, and I print a 
lot of takes--an indecent number-to 
the dismay of every studio that I've ever 
been associated with. But, I mean, if 
you can have an entire life geared to 
the creation of that one piece of film, 
and then at that point you suddenly 
invoke limits, it seems to me the most 
absurd thing in the world. You know, 
you have thousands of acres of wheat-
field, and then when you come to bake 
the bread, you decide it's only going 
to be half a loaf long and that's it. It's 
ridiculous. 

Do you eliminate many scenes in the 
editing of your films? 

No, we don't. In Bonnie and Clyde I 
don't think we eliminated more than a 
minute or a minute and a half. The pic-
ture that's on the screen is the script 
as we shot it. What we eliminated were 
overly explicit utterances where an 
image took care of the idea. 

We began one sequence about five 
speeches Into the scene-the scene 
which ends with his saying, "I would 
live in one state and rob banks in 
another.'' We found that what we had 
viewed In the scene before, where 
they had made love, took care of the 
whole preparation of the followng 
scene. We didn't need It, so we simply 
jumped Into the middle of it. But that's 
all we cut out In Bonnie and Clyde. 

In general, do you think you have as much 
freedom working with studios as you 
wouJd want? Were you able to do as much 
with Bonnie and Clyde as a Warner 
Brothers production as you might have 
wanted to? 

Yes. After the fact, I would have to say 
that we were not limited by the studio 
at all. During the making of It, there was 
always the potentiality that a very 
severe imposition of limits could have 
taken place ••• 

I take it this was true of The Chase. 

Yes. It not only could have taken place, 
but it did take place, totally. 

Fortunately, studios are growing up 
now. They are recognizing that tho 
nature of film is changing and that 
they have to give the people who make 
the films the opportunity to put them 
together in their own way. In my next 
film, for instance, I had no difficulty in 
getting the right to cut it in New York, 
the right to cut it in my own way. There 
has been no intereference at all. 

Studios are disappearing as studios 
and becoming what they always have 
been in true character, financing or-
ganizations. They're business organi-
zations, and any pretentlons towards 
the aesthetic are only the reflections of 
some elderly, vain men. 

Do you still enjoy working with theater? 

Yes, I enjoy the theater a lot. I don't 
know that I enjoy working with Broad· 
way theater; I think it's silly. 

There's something to be learned 
about distillation in theater that's very 
important. Also good actors clearly 
come from the theater. I found Estelle 
Parsons and Gene Hackman at a sum-
mer stock theatre in Stockbridge. 

Do you th ink there's as much room for 
personal expression in theater as in film? 

No. But I don't think there's a great 
deal wrong with not having personal 
expression sometimes. There's some-
thing to be said for technical craft, for 
the ability to elucidate someone else's 
work. 

More and more I'm learning to get 
rid of the disciplines of the theater 
when I'm making a film. In the theater 
the script is embalmed. It Is The Text, 
a revered work. A man's written It, 
and it's meant to be delivered as such. 

In the cinema, the dialogue Is only a 
guide. My good writing friends are 
often offended by the literary level of 
the scripts of my films. On the other 
hand, I keep thinking It doesn't maHer 
a great deal, and I'm sort of offended 
sometimes by the look of their plays. 

There's an awful lot of vanity that's 
inherent In the moviemaking event. It's 
a seductive event. Seldom In one's 
fantasies can one achieve the kind of 
power that you literally have on a 
movie set. Power corrupts; movie 
power corrupts absolutely. Dialogue 
in cinema only serves as a guide to a 
kind of visualization, and if this be 
megalomania, so be it. There is only 
one event In making movies, and that's 
the director's event. It Is not anybodY 
else's. I don't care how well wriHen tht 
script Is. You can go down and get Into 
a motel room in Texas, and the 
dialogue can be exquisite, but what 
you choose to look at and how you look 
at it is everything, everything. I mean. 
I can show you tons of out-takes whert 
I looked at the wrong thing, and I can 
only say that had the movie been made 
up of those out-takes, It would have 
been a dreadful movie. You know, it's 
perfectly possible to not see somethin9 
In the right way. That's the whole thin9: J 
it's really a cyclops experience. You 
get that one glassy eye with which you 
see everything, and that's movies.
