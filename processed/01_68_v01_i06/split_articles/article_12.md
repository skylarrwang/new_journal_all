1bis analysis of the function of the in-
saoity defense and the role of the jury has 
.ewnJ soft spots. The first question is 
wbether the jury realizes that it is being 
liked to make a moral judgment. After 
;e 
Jiltening to a parade of psychiatrists and 
Uy 
beiaB instructed by the judge to determine 
ts. 
wbether the defendant is suffering from a 
"mental disease or defect," the jury may 
pardonably conclude that the question as-
siped it is more medical than moral. 

Moreover, even if the jury realizes that 
it must make a moral judgment, bow 
does it balance this against the other judg-
ments it must make? An acquittal for 
insanity does not merely mean that the 
jury has absolved the defendant from 
"bbame." As pointed out earlier, it also 
means that the defendant will go to a 
mental institution instead of to prison. He 
may or may not receive any help or treat-
ts, 
ment there; he may or may not find it easy 
toFt out. The jury's verdict sets all those 
wheels in motion. Yet in most trials the 
py is not even told that the defendant 
acquitted for insanity will be committed 
y 
IDCl not immediately released; nowhere is 
it told what will happen to him once in 
e 
lbe hospital. Certainly, as long as we are 
0 
~ 
10 band the jury this great undigested lump 
ol decision-making responsibility, we 
should hand them th,j: fullest possible in-
formation not only about the defendant 
but also about what the consequences of 
n 
their verdict will be. To paraphrase 
:Jt 
Justice Cardozo, "Moral judgments in the 
air, as it were, will not do." 

Furthermore, should we ask the jury to 
deliver a single elliptic verdict which must 
respond to such divergent questions as 
whether the criminal law should formally 
"condemn" the offender, use him as an 
1.1. 
eumple to others, rehabilitate him, or 
simply restrain him to protect society? 

We might tell the jury clearly that its 
oaly task is to determine the facts and to 
clecide whether "blame" is in order, and 
tbat the judge or some later agency will 
!lis 
decide the issues of restraint, rehabilitation 
IDd the deterrence of others. If, on the 
o 
Giber hand, we wish the jurors to consider 
such questions, should we not perhaps al-
low the jury to address itself separately to 
s 
"Do you find this man evil and blame-
·r' 
WWthy?" and "Do you think this man is so 
dipaerous that he must be confined to 
protect the community?" and "Do we have 
( lhe ri&ht or the duty to 'treat' this man and 
condition him to accept and conform to 
our norms?" 

In either case, shouldn't we at least tell 
~jury, one way or the other, which issues 
lllbould consider, and which will be 
r 
raolved elsewhere-to the extent, of 
COUrse, that these questions can ever be 
leparated and considered one at a time? 

Professor Goldstein does not address 
tbae issues. He seems, implicitly, to as-
lllme that the "moral judgment"' he finds 
DeC:essary can be and is isolated when 
a JUrY decides to acquit for insanity. 

ll'erhaps, on the other hand, be feels that 
"dae hard-to-state purposes of the su~ 
~ve law" must be lumped together 
~the single question: Guilty or Insane? 

'Nbic:hever the reason, a more rounded 
Qpiaoation for his faith in the jury to 
-.ban unstructured and largely unin-
llra&:ted response to the insanity defense 
.._..be welcome. 

Professor Goldstein's second principal 
.__for accepting the insanity defense 
~llllbething like its present form lies in 
-Yalue he attaches to the adversarial 
...-... Like the role of the jury, this also 
••familiar issue in the law. The value of 
vigorous advocacy by both sides in decid-
ing such crucial questions as guilt or 
innocence is clear. Professor Goldstein 
contributes a valuable chapter to the 
problem of providing an effective defense 
for the indigent accused who is mentally 
ill. Indeed, much of his book is well cal-
culated to instruct the lawyer in deciding 
how and when to raise the insanity de-
fense; if read by enough lawyers, The 
Insanity Defense will do much to enhance 
the sophistication and effectiveness of 
innumerable future trials. 

The costs of the adversarial process are 
also clear, however,to Professor Goldstein 
as well as others. An issue continually 
bruited about is whether a battle of expert 
witnesses at the trial should be permitted to 
confuse the jury. The psychiatrist for the 
defense testifies to the insanity of the ac-
cused. His counterpart hired by the prose-
cution, in equally impressive jargon says, 
"Not so." How much better, say some, to 
have a single impartial expert appointed by 
the court. Professor Goldstein rejects this 
proposal perhaps too emphatically. He 
points out that many such court-appointed 
experts are poorly qualified. This is a valid 
criticism, but it goes to the way things are 
done, not the way they might be. Professor 
Goldstein also argues that much of the 
"battle of experts" is real, and not simply 
the result of professionals playing hired 
gun: responsible psychiatrists do often 
differ on the proper diagnosis of an ac-
cused, and-more senselessly--on 
whether his condition should be labeled 
a "mental disease." Professor Goldstein 
thinks the danger that the jury will be 
confused or overawed by such disagree-
ment is overrated. He feels strongly that 
"the factual issues and normative prob-
lems calling most for decision by a jury" 
should be fully aired before them. 

This insistence on a full adversarial 
proceeding is integral to Professor Gold-
stein's belief in the need for an insanity 
defense. It is a respectable, time-honored 
and forcefully argued position. But in 
sending everything to the jury through an 
adversarial proceeding, Professor Gold-
stein may focus too much on the best 
choice among presently available alter-
natives and too little on the best possible 
solution. He may truly believe that the 
jury is the best body in every way and for 
all time to decide every question. But his 
faith .in, or at any rate reliance upon the 
jury may also reflect a distrust for psy-
chiatrists, the effectiveness with which 
courts can review their decisons, and, 
most important, the willingness of society 
to provide enough good psychiatrists. 

Perhaps, with time, some or all of these 
parameters may change. If so, Professor 
Goldstein will then undoubtedly re-
examine his conclusions. Unfortunately, 
his book devotes too much attention to 
patching up the status quo and too little 
to considering the need for and p<Xsibility 
of an approach qualitatively different 
from the present regime. •
