The Insanity Defense, by Abraham Gold-
stein, Yale University Press. 

Abraham Goldstein 

The defendant, who pole-axed his wife, 
claims he was insane at the time. Psy-
chiatrists testify to and fro to that, arguing 
learnedly before the jury whether the ac-
cused is a paranoid schizophrenic, a psy-
chopath or whatever. Finally, the judge 
instructs the jurors to acquit the defendant 
if they find he was indeed insane. 

That, in a cameo, is your standard 
scenario for the insanity defense. The 
drama seems straightforward enough. It's 
not The confusion begins with the in-
structions the judge must give the jury, 
and pinwheels out from there. 

What tests shall the judge instruct the 
jury to apply in deciding whether this de-
fendant should be held accountable for 
his acts? Tabloid readers who follow with 
titillated glee the trials of ax-murderers 
would say, of course, whether the acc.used 
"knew right from wrong." Fleshed out 
with the preliminary question of whether 
he was "under such a defect of reason . . . 
as not to know the nature and quality of 
the act," this is a facsimile of the famous 
M'Naghten rule. In the century or so since 
the English courts abandoned the "wild 
beast" test-which had slipped into the 
law a century or so before that by a 
mistranslation from the Latin of a thir-
teenth-century scholar who wasn't talking 
about the insanity defense anyway-the 
M'Naghten rule has been the test in the 
large majority of states. 

·More recently, a number of states have 
adopted--exclusively or in addition to the 
M'Naghten test-the rule that the accused 
should be found not guilty by reason of 
insanity if he had a mental disease which 
made him unable to control his conduct. 
The American Law Institute, in its pro-
posed Model Penal Code, has combined 
the two-although it carefully changes the 
"know ... " of the M'Naghten to "appre-
ciate" the criminality of his act and the 
"control ... " of the more recent test to 
"conform" his conduct to the requirements 
of the law. The latter change seems sense-
less; the former-because "appreciate" is 
a nuance broader than "know"-is worth-
while. Both, however, assume that the 
twelve good men and true on the jury are 
as sensitive to language as a linguistic 
philosopher. Finally, in 1954 the District 
of Columbia Court of Appeals decided 
that "an accused is not criminally respon-
sible if his unlawful act was the product of 
mental disease or mental defect." Only 
Maine and the Virgin Islands have fol-
lowed the District of Columbia in adopt-
ing this test, but the rule of Durham v. 
United States has inspired a torrent of law 
review articles fretting about the proper 
phrasing of the judge's charge to the jury. 

Now comes Professor Abraham Gold-
stein with his book The Insanity Defense. 
He makes, and documents, two immensely 
valuable points: (1) the precise wording of 
the insanity defense-that is, the language 
with which the judge charges the jury-is 
hardly worth the reams of foolscap de-
voted to it, and (2) the insanity defense 
itself plays but a small role in removing 
men who are in some sense crazy from the 
conveyor belt which carries criminals from 
arrest to arraignment to indictment to 
trial to prison. 

In the movement for new tests of in-
sanity the M'Naghten rule has been 
whipped with remarkable fervor. Its lan-
guage of "knov. ing right from wrong.·· 
the reformers <ihout, wrongly focuses on 
the misleadingly narrow " cognitive" 
aspects of mental health and r~ on an 
archaically "compartmentalized" concep-
tion of the min d. The critics of the rule 
never tire of pointing to those defendants 
who quite rationally realize both the 
"nature" of their acts and that the com-
munity considers them "wrong," yet who 
kill or rob anyway because of their 
crippled personalities and twisted values. 
Surely, say the critics, we cannot "blame" 
these men or expect them to be deterred 
by the punishment threatened by a society 
of which they feel no part. Moreover, the 
critics argue, the narrow gauge of the 
M'Naghten rule leads judges to refuse to 
admit evidence which, while not showing 
that the defendant did not know right from 
wrong, would present to the jury a rounded 
image of h is mental problems and, hence, 
of his blameworthiness. 

Unlike most of the critics, Professor 
Goldstein has taken the time to read the 
cases and to ponder the extent to which 
the jury will be cowed by the judge's in-
structions. He finds that judges almost 
never refuse to admit any evidence con-
cerning the mental history of the defen-
dant, regardless of its bearing on the 
narrow question of whether he knew right 
from wrong. Moreover, courts are usually 
willing to let psychiatrists testify that 
"know" should not be interpreted in a 
narrow "cognitive" sense but in the broad, 
textured sense of whether the defendant 
understood and appreciated emotionally 
the wrongfulness of his conduct. Most 
important, the jury can and will acquit for 
insanity a defendant who it feels should 
not be condemned, regardless of the 
sonorous formula given it by the judge. 

Having shown that much of the abuse 
heaped upon the M'Naghten rule has been 
unjust, Professor Goldstein applies that 
same treatment to the word-quibbling with 
which reformers have attacked other tests 
they find too narrow, with the same result: 
the words of the rule foUowed by the court 
play almost no role in deciding the critical 
question of what evidence the jury will be 
allowed to bear, and probably as small a 
part in guiding or determining the jury's 
verdict. 

After thus showing the relative unim-
portance of the games lawyers play over 
the wording of the insanity defense, Pro-
fessor Goldstein goes on to show the rela-
tive unimportance of the insanity defense 
itself. Very few defendants plead the in-
sanity defense. The really mad never enter 
the criminal process; the police or the pros-
ecutor shunt them off to the insane asylum 
early in the game. Of those that remain, 
many are found "incompetent" to stand 
trial-
they cannot understand the nature 
of the charges against them, or cooperate 
in their own defense. And so off they go 
to the insane asylum. The class is now 
reduced to a relative handful who may 
have been in some sense mad when they 
committed their criminal acts, but who are 
at least superficially lucid at the time of 
trial. Of these, only a very few would be 
so foolish as to plead insanity. The reason 
is simple, although seldom appreciated by 
the public. A guilty plea results in a deter-
minate sentence, and with good behavior 
and a proper show of penitence the crim-
inal can count on his freedom in not too 
many years. An insanity acquittal, on the 
other hand, almost always results in com-
mitment to a mental institution, and release 
from a mental institution is at best an 
iffy proposition. The usual statutory 
standard is a finding by the hospital 
physicians. and possibly by a coun, that 
the inmate has recovered his sanity or is 
no longer dangerous, or both. Particularly 
in the case of a man committed after a 
violent crime, both physicians and courts 
are predictably reluctant to make such 
findings. Thus, the defendant "acquitted" 
for instanity actually faces an indefinite 
period of confinement. Hospitals for the 
criminally insane are hardly Sunnybrook 
Farms, moreover, and society treats those 
who are released with an ad version usually 
reserved for lepers and returned turncoats. 

The net effect of all this is that no de-
fendant in or out of his right mind raises 
the insanity defense unless the conse-
quence of a normal conviction would be 
execution or a very long sentence indeed. 

Since the defense is of such slight im-
portance in determining the disposition of 
the pitiful hordes who stream through the 
criminal process, why all the excitement 
about the insanity defense? Why indeed? 
True, the defense when raised in a sensa-
tional case does enliven the trial. And the 
conceptual issue is well calculated to call 
forth the best and worst from psychiatrists, 
philosophers and lawyers. But why not 
worry instead about the problem in full 
outline: how should society identify and 
deal with the criminal who somehow is 
not like the rest of us? At best the insanity 
defense plays a small role in the total 
drama, and good reasons can be and have 
been suggested why it should be forgotten 
altogether. 

The issues cast up by proposals to 
abolish the insanity defense are far too 
complex to be argued in a book review. 
And it is ultimately unfair to challenge an 
author for writing the book he did and not 
some other. But it can fairly be asked why 
Professor Goldstein, well aware of the 
limitations of the insanity defense, still 
feels that its fulfills a needed function in 
the law. The alternative would be, in 
broadest outline, to remove the thorny 
issue of mental abnormality from the trial. 
where determination of the defendant's 
sanity becomes bogged down by the 
elaborate procedural ritual of the adver-
sarial process, and instead to evaluate the 
defendant's mental condition in a more 
informal post-trial proceeding to decide his 
disposition. 

Professor Goldstein has, essentially, two 
reasons for retaining the insanity defense 
in something like its present form. The 
first revolves around the role he envisages 
for the jury; the second, around the value 
he attaches to the adversarial process. Tbe 
need for a jury determination of
