One of the most lyrical scenes in Bonnie 
Mil Clyde occurs when the two finally 
deep together, and it comes so late in the 
picture so close to their destruction. Why 
there?

an ultimate naivete In this outcast. 
But he does die .. .. 

He does d/e, he does die. I mean, we 
were not in that sense trying to alter 
that kind of fantasy. If anything, we 
were substantiating the mythic char-
acter of it: So and so did so and so; 
he climbed Mount Olympus •.• and he 
died. It runs In mythology as rather a 
common form. Prometheus brought life 
and then was chained to the mountain 
and had his liver torn out. 

There is a consequence to those 
kinds of deeds that Is Greek, that runs 
back, and it Is more than Greek-It's 
mythic. I think people endow mythical 
characters with those capacities: both 
to ascend the heights and aJso to be 
levelled again, once again. 

I would say, though, that every man 
has his own periods when he seems to 
ascend the heights, but the general 
experience afterwards is quite a lonely, 
desperate, pessimistic one. 

About this love and death theme-do you 
think there's a similar and even more 
explicit situation in uft-Handed Gun? 
When Billy first makes love to the girl, he 
walks away, turns around, and pretends 
he's drawing a gun. When he dies, he 
makes the same gesture, the pretense of 
shooting a gun. 

Yes, yes. It was the aame character, 
the same sexual character, in that pic-
ture as in Bonnie and Clyde. You're the 
first one to see It, but that was the truth. 
But It was associated, It is associated 
for me with the outcast character.lt Is 
related In that sense to the man who 
perhaps would view entry into the 
woman as entry Into society-as a kind 
of relaxation of his abilities to remain 
out at the edge. The edge of his anti-
social desires might be blunted by that 
sexual act. 

It's meant to be true In both cases, 
since both Billy and Clyde are outlaws 
-different, let me aay, from The 
Chase, where I didn't think of Bubber 
as an outlaw. 

Why does Bubber come home after his 
escape from prison? There seems to be a 
sort of blind force driving him towards 
that town. 

I don't know. I don't really have an 
answer to that. We didn't have a good 
answer to that for a whole year. We 
kept raising the lasue, but we could 
never really resolve it properly for our-
selves. We spoke a lot of bullshit about 
It, but none of It really held water, and 
it doesn't hold water on the screen. It's 
not true, just not true at all. 

Do you think there's a similar blind force 
driving, let's say, M ickey One or Bonnie 
and Clyde? 

No. Bonnie and Clyde have a very 
specific force driving them. They set 
up a set of circumstances, and the 
circumstances eventuate In something 
beyond their expectations, which 
throws them outside of the law. 

Mickey• was a very different char-
acter in that sense. There's only one 
force driving Mickey. I wish there'd 
been more. The one force for Mickey 
was the feeling of having become the 
outcast and wanting to re-enter. The 
only thing he couldn't stand was to be 
outside of society. That was intolerable 
to him-to have the anonymity, the 
identltyless-ness. In that sense, Mickey 
is a less interesting and, for me, less 
heroic character than either Billy or 
Bonnie and Clyde. 

There seems a certain romantic attitude in 
the way you approach the relationship of 
Bonnie and Clyde and of Bubber and his 
wife, Anna, in The Chase. 

Well, I don't think the Bubber-Anna 
relationship can really be compared 
with the one between Bonnie and 
Clyde. I think, In very simple terms, that 
Bubber came home to commit suicide • 
He had no ego left. He had no real 
destiny left. And he knew that that re-
lationship with his wife was, to all 
intents and purposes, non-existent. So 
he came home, and it was a suicidal 
act. 

I don't think that was true of Bonnie 
and Clyde. I don't think they were 
motivated out of a suicidal desire. 
They were motivated out of a more 
naive view of the world: that better 
things could be achieved. That she 
could wear a silk dress and go into the 
Adolphus Hotel. That he could set to 
rights the poor, foreclosed farmer. 
That he could, In a sense, level out part 
of the injustices of his society. The 
thing finally escalated quite out of their 
control; that Is the sadness of lt. But I 
wouldn't compare them as couples at 
all. 

*Mick~y On~ (1965), Penn's third film. 
deals with a successful nightclub comedian 
(Warren Beatty) who is suddenly and inexpli-
cably threatened by a nameless crime and 
faceless mob. He runs away and tries to bury 
himself in the slums of Chicago, working in 
honky-tont dives. He is asked to audition for 
a spot in a classier nightclub. but, thinking 
this to be an effort by the mob to draw him 
out of hiding. he again ftees. After a 
cathartic beating. he returns to face the 
audition, pre;~;ided over by a huge, blinding 
spotlight. and frees himself of his anxieties.

8 I The New JoumaiiJanuary 21, 1968 
I was really talking about an infantile 
sense of justice, a kind of pre-Oedipal 
sense of justice: an inability to recon-
cile the fact that someone had really 
slept with his mother, so that these men 
were constantly transgressors. They 
were contantly failing his system of 
justice, his unbearable system of jus-
tice. At the end of the picture, he then 
becomes the transgressor. The act of 
sleeping with the woman, the wife of 
the man who has been his protector, Is 
his way of sealing his own fate by do-
Ing the very act for which he has been 
punishing people all through the film. 

A very powerful, almost cathartic violence 
runs through both The Chase and Bonnie 
and Clyde whenever these outcast char-
acters are confronted by the society from 
which they're running away or trying to 
change. Is this violence a significant ele-
ment within the films? 

Yeah, within the films and within me. I 
think that I would like to knock a lot of 
heads together, a lot of heads, and 
that's how I do it. I think that society 
could use a lot of heads knocked 
together. 

Your films give a very strong sense that 
this is the only way it can be done. 

I'm afraid that's what I believe, sad to 
say. I mean, I believe in all kinds of 
pacific means, but if you really search 
deeply, I don't have a great deal of be-
lief that they will work. I do have a cer-
tain belief that muscle will work, that 
some heads knocked together will 
work. 

Whenever I've seen the need for 
social change, and I see it-we see It 
all the time, it seems to me that the 
defenders of the status quo are the 
most resilient, Impenetrable bastions. 
It's so difficult to ever assault them 
that I find a certain persuasion in 
those people who counsel violence, 
who really act with a certain violence. 
I'm thinking now of the Negro situation 
in the civil rights movement today. 

Up to a certain point I believe In the 
marches and the non-violence, but I 
have to say that, at this point, 1 do not 
have much faith In them. I mean, when 
I see the faces of the fat, grinning 
sheriffs in Philadelphia, Mississippi, 
reason departs. Alii want to do is get 
one of my heroes out of the movie to 
let 'em have it! 

Your style often reflects this violence. 
For instance, the opening of Bonnie and 
Clyde is technically rather spectacular. 
Wbat were you trying to achieve in those 
very jarring, oppressive close-ups at the 
beginning--of Bonnie undressing and 
coming to the window and later of Bonnie 
and Clyde after they meet? 

It didn't have a great deal of meanjng 
to me. It was really a technique choice. 
At the beginning I thought: where I 
really want to open up and see the 
landscape is when the two of them 
get together and get in the car ••• and 
head out I That's really where 1 want to 
see what field it is that they're operat-
ing on. Previous to that, the only field, 
it seems to me, Ia the look in the eye, 
the shape of the lips and how it goes 
around a coke bottle .••. So I just de-
cided to get in there as close as we 
possibly could. That was really a fairly 
simpl•minded choice. 

You seem to be preoccupied by cars. Key 
scenes in both Mickey One and The Chase 
are set in auto junkyards, and Bonnie and 
Clyde takes place almost exclusively in 
cars. Do you see these vehicles as symbols 
of modern life? 

No, I really don't. There are two things 
at work. The junkyard in The Chase is 
really a wholly personal prejudice of 
mine. I live in the country, and when-
ever I drive up I keep seeing these 
things growing larger and larger. 

I think of them as a festering sore that 
Is absolutely unbearable to behold. 

I mean there's a town called Craryville, 
New York, a sweet, innocent little town. 
I would say that probably one-quarter 
of it is now covered with automobile 
bodies rusting, which struck me as a 
terribly disgusting sight. 

VIsually, It was a disgusting sight. 
So when we were trying to think of a 
place for the ending of The Chase, that 
one seemed natural to me, where I 
could get two things off at once. One 
was a kind of jungle feeling which was 
absolutely necessary, whatever the 
jungle equivalent would be for this 
society. The automobile junkyard 
seemed to me to be a very apposite 
symbol for it. And so, in that rather 
simpl•minded way, it suggested itself, 
and at the same time I got rid of a great 
deal of the hostilities I had towards 
Craryville, New York. 

The case in Bonnie and Clyde is 
rather different. That has a certain 
historical base. As one of the more 
sympathetic observers said about 
Bonnie and Clyde (the real Bonnie and 
Clyde, not the characters in the film), 
they were Invented by the V-8 engine. 
In a certain sense, that was true. When 
Ford came out with the V-8'a the major-
ity of the police still had the old 6's, the 
old Model T's and Model A's. Bonnie 
and Clyde would inevitably steal a 
V-8, a powerful car which could permit 
them not only to outrun the police of 
any local community but also to move 
across state borders. 

That was their pattern. It was not 
unusual for them to drive seven and 
eight hundred miles a night. They were 
peregrinating souls on a very desperate 
level, and right at the head of It was 
that engine that was really driving 
them. 

So that's what prompted us in 
Bonne and Clyde to rely on the auto-
mobile. It also became their province. 
The inside of the automobile became 
their home. They would pick up people 
and drive them several hundred miles 
for conversation and society. That's 
why we included the scene of the un-
dertaker and his girl in the film. Bonnie 
and Clyde picked them up because 
they had nobody else to talk to. 

How real is the world in which Bonnie 
and Clyde are living? Do you think such a 
completely self-shaped existence is pos-
sible any more? 

I don't think it was possible even then. 
We delineated a world which Isn't an 
actual documentary vision of the world 
as It was then. We stripped away almost 
all the extraneous details we could. 
The visual essence of the picture Is 
what it leaves out, for the most part. 
This barrenness was extremely Inten-
tional. 

I don't think for a minute that we 
were creating any kind of world as 
world, I mean, any kind of society as 
society. We were creating It only as 
two narcissistic, mutually-Involved kids 
might view It, which Is really as a series 
of targets or objects--or simply as 
specific downtrodden people who 
might motivate Bonnie and Clyde to 
attack the targets. The movie Is in that 
sense an abstraction rather than 
genuine reportage. 

I think I meant more specifically the 
characters of Bonnie and Clyde and the 
way they chose to live: this robbing of 
banks and then running away. How long 
could this actually keep going? The use 
of the poem, the legend of Bonnie and 
Clyde-there seems something mythic 
about their existence. 

Oh, I think they had a strong mythic 
sense about themselves. Anyway she 
surely did. I don't think he did. I think 
he was kind of a clod. Even though her 
ballads are doggerel, they show she 
has a certain ability to confront her 
situation in a more honest way than 
he was ever able to do. 

I don't know, I suppose they could 
have gone on robbing banks. They 
were petty thieves at heart. They were 
not killers. J. Edgar Hoover may take 
exception, but I don't think of them as 
killers. I don't think they set out with 
that intention. They really set out to 
level things out a little bit. The banks 
had the money; they didn't have the 
money. And that just didn't seem right 
to them. So they decided to get a little 
bit of it. 

In the course of getting a little bit of 
it, they attracted C. W. Into their orbit. 
He provided the ridiculous instrument 
by which they then created their first 
murder. Having created it, they were 
committed to a course of action that 
was really larger than they were. 

Murder is in a certain sense bigger 
than these two characters. They're 
more thieves than murderers. They had 
no noble Intentions of deposing some 
kind of reigning monarch or setting 
evil to rights. They killed accidentally, 
and they continued to kill accidentally. 

There also seems a certain accidental, 
indifferent manner in the way they them-
selves get killed. There is something fright-
ening in the expression of that Texas 
Ranger, so cold, so indifferent, and it 
just seemed to happen. Even the way 
the film ends seems to reflect this. It just 
stops, rather than coming to a more 
obvious, dramatic resolution. 

Yea, the mood of the ending was very 
intentional. It was an affectless death. 
Sheriff Hamer himself didn't have any 
strong feeling about them. He wasn't 
operating Inside any code or system of 
honor or morality. He had his job to do. 
They had their job to do. And that 
seems to me to be about the worst kind 
of killing. One could make a very 
strong case for Adolph Eichmann ex· 
actly on those terms. 

It seemed to me an excessively 
thorough death. You know-the man 
who summoned all his resources to 
break the butterfly on the rack. It was 
the righteous Indignation of a certain 
segment of society acted out so thatH 
becomes at least as ugly as anything 
the victims of their attack might have 
done themselves. The justice meted 
out by the forces of law and order 
seems to me far worse than the crimes 
that they're avenging, and this was 0111 
of the instances. 

The death of Bonnie and Clyde was 
literally and historically accurate. TM1 \ 
did fire a thousand rounds. There wert 
eighty-seven distinct hits on the bodill 
of Bonnie and Clyde. As recently as 
1946, the car was being toured around 
the Southwest, shown at carnivals: The 
Death Car of Bonnie and Clyde. It's a 
kind of gothic, grotesque behavior, alii 
I would be hard-pressed at this point 
to make any choices, between Sherlft 
Hamer and Bonnie and Clyde, I think 
I'd choose Bonnie and Clyde. 

Do you think that Sherriff Hamer is in thJI 
respect similar to Pat Garrett in The Left· 
handed Gun? They both seem to bring 
about this justice from completely perS()Illi 
motives. 

Right. Right. I do. I think that the self· 
righteousness of the arm of justice II 
almost the most dangerous thing thert • 
is, because it's unreal. I don't think 
these people understand their own 
motives when they supposedly act 0111 
their acts of justice. I'm not entirely 
sure that I believe that somebody whO 
becomes a policeman has very high 
motives to begin with. 

Historically, a good case could be 
made for the fact that Bonnie and 
Clyde, as national figures, were 
elevated to a kind of artiflcal promi-
nence. They were endowed with chal' 
acteristics that they did not necessarilY 
have, mad-dog killers and so forth. 
This was done for a very specific r..-
son, an historical, constabulatory 
reason. Before that time, acts of justiC' 
were confined within a state. But wHII 
the advent of the V-8 automobile, 
people were able to cross the state 
lines. There became known then the 
' 
need for a national police force. 

The creation of this national pollcl 
was regarded, however, with a great 
deal of suspicion by the members of 
Congress and the people because H 
was absolutely against the spirit of..,

say, perhaps generically, that 
~ut outcasts, probably films 
lltout anybody, have to do with some 
lind of arrested emotional state that's 
-.oclated with a childhood experl-
-. 

Probably the only really adult 
figure in The Chase was Sheriff Calder, 
Marion Brando. He was a man whose 
whole action In the picture was to hold 
onto a mature view and avoid an ln-
fanlte retaliatory-aggressive stance. He 
had to try to cool it as best he could in 
a community which was somewhat In-
fantile In Its views. The sadness of that 
story is that Calder tailed. 

The other sadness Is that we tailed 
Calder. We tailed Brando In the tact 
that we didn't dramatize that nearly 
well enough, and that seems to me to 
be the conspicuous failure of that film. 

It seems to me an interesting character 
*l n The Chase (1965), a high-budget Sam 
Spiegel production, Penn encountered his 
most serious difficulties in completing a film. 
He eventually lost control over the editing, 
and several scenes were re-shot after his 
departure. The film remains, however, one 
of his most impressive achievements, an 
examination of the violence lying beneath the 
surface of a listless Texas town controlled by 
a Big Daddy-like oil baron, Val Rogers (E. G. 
Marshall). The escape of Bubber Reeves 
(Robert Redford) from the state prison aggra-
vates the town's pent-up frustrations, 
complicated by several childhood grudges and 
the fact that Bubber's wife (Jane Fonda) has 
defected to Rogers' son (James Fox). A 
boozed-up Saturday-night mob traps Bubber 
in a junk yard before he is rescued by Calder 
(Marlon Brando), a dedicated sheriff. 
However, Bubber is assassinated before 
Calder can return rum to jail. Rogers' son dies 
as a result of the lynch-mob's violence, and 
Calder, giving the town up for lost, resigns his 
position and leaves. 

and an Interesting motive, and we 
stepped all over our feet trying to get 
that on the screen. I mean, we never 
did. 

In the sense that Calder fails, it seems that 
none of these outcasts, these figures in 
direct conflict with society, are capable 
of really changing it. I think this feeling 
is expressed in the scene in which Bonnie 
and Clyde are shooting outside the aban-
doned house, taken over by the banks. The 
dispossessed farmer and his worker come 
and take several pot-shots at the house. 
T here seems a kind hopelessness in the 
sense that they're firing at it, trying to 
get back at it, but they can't. 

Yes. I don't know that I think outcasts 
or people who engage In these kinds 
of acts of violence can necessarily ef-
fect change. I think, however, that there 
want a foreign language keyboard? 
Special keys for law courses? 
Is no other choice for them. I think they 
have to do that. And I think that only 
with a vision of history can we see that 
maybe, maybe In some nutty way, they 
did really affect change. But at the 
time, I don't think we can ever point to 
change. I mean, more change has prob-
ably been accomplished by Gandhi 
than by Jesse James or William Tell, 
but maybe that's only true in certain cir-
cumstances. In other circumstances, 
sometimes I think people have had to 
go to Spain and fight the tight and lose 
the fight, In order to create a kind of 
conscience tor the rest of us that Is a 
part of us the rest of our lives. In that 
respect It's fortunate that these people 
do their thing. 

We'd like to ask some more technical 
questions now. Your actors are always 
given very strong physical characteriza-
tions. We remember characteristics which 
are very powerfully delineated visually. 
How closely do you work with your actors 
in getting this kind of effect? 

Pretty closely. I really have a lot to do 
with that. I like kinetic behavior; I think 
that's good tor cinema. Kinetic-cinema, 
the two words have the same source. 
I think It's good cinema for some-
body to walk In a certain way and to 
move in a certain way. After all, you're 
showing a distillation. You're showing 
some ninety minutes out of a lifetime, 
so somebody had better come through 
a door In a very particular way, or hit a
