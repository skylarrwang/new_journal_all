**Title: Beleaguered Biafra and the threat of genocide**
**Author: Jonathan Lear**
**Page number(s): 3**

The final chords of Handel's Judas Maccabaeus resonated through Woolsey Hall proclaiming the triumph of the persecuted Israelites. Lazarus Ekwueme left his place in the choir and walked the single, snowy black back to his one-room apartment next to George and Harry's.

This particular oratorio had struck a personal note with Laz, a graduate student in music, who has been away from his African home for two years now. It filled him with the thoughts of his people-the lbos. "We are the Jews of Africa," Laz said after the concert. "We have so much in common with the Jews: ambition, love of education, pride ... and persecution."


Genocide is imminent for the eight million Ibos that are his people. Some of the leading powers of the world actively support the forces inflicting the genocide; the American press indirectly lends support to those forces; the American government refuses to take any position; and the American people are largely unaware of the helpless condition of an entire people facing annihilation.


When I met Laz shortly after the Woolsey Hall concert, the muscles in his face were tight and his speech abrupt. Trying to ask an innocuous question that would ease tension, I made my first faux pas. I asked where his home was located in Nigeria.

"I am not from Nigeria," he said. "I am from Biafra. I am a Biafran."


Newspapers and diplomats insist on calling it Nigeria, but the region is wracked by a civil war so intense, so divisive, so bloody, that it is doubtful a united Nigeria in any old sense of the word will ever exist again. Thirty thousand lbos who lived in the North of Nigeria lost their lives in a series of pogroms in 1966. An additional two million Ibos fled the pogroms in a mass exodus to the East, the home of their population.


On the first anniversary of the Northern Pogrom, after the federal government reneged on agreements which might have mended the nation, the Eastern Region seceded from Nigeria. The Republic of Biafra was born on May 29, 1967. Civil war followed shortly. The federal government, with its capital at Lagos, expected to crush the rebels within a week. They did not anticipate Biafran determination: the war is still being waged.


The federal troops seem intent on eliminating the 14 million people (eight million of them Ibos) who call themselves Biafrans. While all major nations conduct diplomatic relations with the federal government, no nation has yet recognized Biafra. Britain and Russia, strange bedfellows, actively support and equip the federal government.


The attitude of the West was ironically revealed in my second faux pas. I asked Laz about the lbo tribe.

"I resent the word tribe as it is applied to the Ibos," he said. "We are a people, a nation. After all, no one talks about the Anglo-Saxon tribe or the German tribe."


In a year Laz will have his Ph.D. in music theory. His older brother has an M.A. in town planning; his younger brother is an English-educated surgeon; his friends in Biafra are all similarly educated. And I ask about his tribe.


The devastating war in Nigeria is condoned, ignored or even supported by the West because it is only black Africans against black Africans. Were there fifty white missionaries whose lives were in danger, the reaction would hardly be the same. Had the exodus of Ibos to Biafra occurred along an internationally recognized boundary it would have been considered one of the world's great refugee problems. Because Biafra is not recognized, however, its two million refugees are passed off as a "domestic problem."


But the reddening eyes and occasional tears that accompanied Laz's descriptions of the war remind one that human deaths are something more than the box scores of a baseball game in an unfamiliar league. Since no mail can get through, Laz has no idea whether his parents are alive or dead. Any letter that is smuggled out of Biafra always carries news of death.


Laz learned from a smuggled letter he received this fall that Northern soldiers had built a fire with books from a school in which he had studied, and had roasted chickens. The books symbolized the education valued by Biafrans. By destroying the books the soldiers felt they were destroying Biafran power.


His fianc√©e, Vicki, whom he left at home so that she could finish her college education, just graduated summa cum laude; and he cannot even send her an application to graduate school.

"Vicki is stuck in the country," he said. "And I am stuck outside, which is even worse."


Laz spends most of his waking hours gathering support for Biafra and funds for Biafran refugees. The International Student Center is sponsoring a fundraising show on March 2, in which Biafran students will perform. He hopes to unite concerned members of the Yale community who could act as a lobbying force on the government and the press to end the carnage.


The plight of the Biafran student in America is one which Laz, as president of the Biafran Students of Connecticut, is trying to ease. Since no mail leaves a blockaded Biafra, Biafran students have been cut off from family funds, and all Nigerian fellowships to Biafrans have been revoked. One of Laz's close friends at Columbia Medical School was forced to drop out and take temporary employment.


In spite of the constricting financial problems, the Biafran students in Connecticut, under Laz's leadership, donated $475 for medical aid to Biafran refugees.

"You'd be surprised how little our finances here are a problem compared with the problem back home," said Laz. "I don't even know how many of my relatives are alive; I only know I will never see all of them again. If one can't go to med school, okay, so he'll get a job and earn some money to send to Biafra. This is the spirit."


On July 31, 1967, a letter appeared in the New York Times, the first in the American press to cry out against the genocide in Nigeria. The author was Richard N. Henderson, an assistant professor of anthropology at Yale who teaches African anthropology. From 1960, when Nigeria became independent, until 1962, Henderson was in that country studying urban structure and the impact of European and American culture. Henderson observed the movement from "Nigeria's brightest hopes to the first signs of danger." He also saw the large role the educated and skilled lbos played in the life of Nigeria. The aggressive, self-assertive orientation of the lbo permeated Onitsha, the town in which he lived.


In his letter to the Times in July, 1967, Henderson wrote that all those who had hopes for Nigeria were appalled at the threat of disintegration. However, he went on to say that legalistic arguments about the unity of Nigeria should not override humanitarian requirements. As the most educated people in Nigeria, the Biafrans provided before the pogroms the real basis for national identity; but the "murderous rampages" on the lbos and the backing out of agreements ironically forced the most nationalistic people to secede. The federal government had exterminated all Biafran faith in the federation. The only possible solution, said Henderson, was the immediate demonstration by "concrete acts" that the federal government is concerned with the welfare and civil rights of the Biafrans.


Henderson's letter provided a flag around which other concerned scholars rallied. An "Appeal for a Cease-Fire in Nigeria," drafted by 13 scholars and missionaries, warned that the entrance of federal troops into the East (Biafra) involved a real danger of genocide. The letter said an immediate cease fire was urgently necessary, and it implored Britain, Russia, and the United States, the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity to act to end the hostilities.


These scholars later formed a Committee for Biafran Refugees with Conor Cruise O'Brien, Albert Schweitzer Professor of Humanities at NYU, as the leading spokesman. Presently they are collecting donations for medical aid to Biafra through the National Council of Churches in New York.


The appeals of the scholars have made clear that no one group can be blamed for the tragic situation in Nigeria. The war is the culmination of a complex history of grievances and hatreds among peoples. Attempting to assign ultimate blame is not only fatuous but also hinders negotiations for a peaceful solution.


The events leading to the war are indeed a complex interweaving of nationalist movements restrained by feudal jealousies. Divided through history by suspicion and hatred, these people of Nigeria were grouped in a federation by a handful of British colonialists, who arbitrarily drew lines on a map of Africa with no regard for cultural or historical unity.


With Nigerian Independence in 1960 the three main language groups of Nigeria, Hausa of the North, Yourba of the West and Ibo of the East entered an increasingly hostile game of king of the mountain for control of the federal government.


None of the groups could control the government alone. Coalitions formed and re-formed, but the Hausa North, with the larger population and territory, always dominated. The Eastern and Western sectors took turns at being excluded.


The lbos in this period were forced to assume the classic role of a minority group. Trade-oriented, valuing education and maintaining strong kinship networks, the lbos became identified as somehow more clever and sly than most. The hatred of the other peoples was vented on the Ibos, and they were blamed for all social malaise. In the Hausa-dominated North the two million lbos, forced to live in ghettos called Sabon Gari (stranger's quarters), were still the most nationalistic group in Nigeria.

"Ibos did not think of themselves only as Ibos, but also as Nigerians," said Henderson.

The spark of nationalism ignited the

**Title: Comment: faculty support for Coffin, glitter on Yale's party scene, and a close look at We Bombed in New Haven.**
**Author: Susan Braudy**
**Page number(s): 2, 14**

A letter of support for the Rev. William S. Coffin is now circulating among Yale faculty members. It states that the signers of the letter are convinced that Rev. Coffin "has acted out of the strongest sense of moral responsibility in protesting the war in Vietnam, and that he has chosen his methods of protest only after careful and anguished reflection."


The 500-word letter states that the "great majority of signers of this statement share Mr. Coffin's conviction that our military involvement in Vietnam is profoundly wrong"; but it makes clear that it is more concerned with the indictment as a symbol of "tragic heightening of the domestic costs of the Vietnam War." In particular, it warns of the danger to a democracy when citizens are forced "to choose between their obligation to the law of their country and their moral obligation to themselves and their fellow citizens."


The letter also warns that the "vague and shadowy charge of conspiracy" may be used in the future to silence those who examine and discuss the issue of conscience.


Sponsors of the letter include Law School dean Louis Pollak; law professors Alexander Bickel, Elias Clark, Abraham Goldstein; political science professors James Barber and Robert Dahl; psychiatry department chairman Theodore Lidz; psychiatry professor Robert Lifton; psychology professor William Kessen; associate professor of molecular biophysics Robert Wilhelm; and history professor C. Vann Woodward.


Faculty who wish to sign the statement are asked to return a signed card to the office of James Barber, 202 Hall of Graduate Studies.


Another statement supporting Rev. Coffin was signed by 14 faculty members who aided in the turning in of draft cards or turned in their own cards on October 21 in Washington. The signers say that since the "Administration has chosen to accelerate the war," they feel "yet more strongly that it is not only our right but is our duty to protest this war and stand by those courageous young men who have done so by refusing the draft." The statement "reaffirms the position of last October and reaffirms our solidarity with each other."


One who will probably not sign any such statements is Yale President Kingman Brewster, who somewhat ominously commented after the indictment was announced: "I have made it clear on several occasions that I think draft resistance and its advocacy as a political tactic is ineffective, unwise and improper. Respect for due process of law, however, requires that anyone who is accused is presumed to be innocent until he is found guilty under a Constitutionally valid law. Therefore the fact of indictment itself does not warrant any change in Mr. Coffin's status at Yale."


Glitter

Carl Reiner did not wear his toupee.
"Ruthie, it was him, I swear. He just looks less hairy."


But Paul Newman did wear his shoes.
"Last time I saw Paul and Joanne, they were at the Copa in Miami. Paul was wearing black tie and his usual black socks. No shoes. It was very formal. Paul hates to wear shoes."


What an evening, December 4, opening night of Joseph Heller's We Bombed in New Haven, in the Yale University Theater. Except for Kenneth Haigh and his sleek friend, the sophisticates on the first two rows of the balcony almost broke their necks leaning and gawking over the edge. Strangers spoke to strangers.
"Who's Heller talking to now? Hermione Gingold?"
"Someone said Mike Nichols is here."
"I hear Clive Barnes and Walter Kerr are in the second row."
"Lady, I wouldn't recognize Clive Barnes if I sat on him. I'm looking for Paul Newman's bald spot."


Intermission came and everybody crowded down for a better view. Three first-year acting students stood on the packed stairs and reported: "Paul is now walking out of the auditorium. He chews his gum with the whole left side of his face. Good news, folks. He's not as short as you've been told. He wears a fitted grey double-vent suit. He is tanned. He is beautiful. He shimmers. He is walking outside into the air with his wife, Joanne Woodward. No, she is not wearing a wig. They're going back inside. Quick, look, or you'll miss him. That's all, folks, he's gone."


After the play, everyone came to the party in the Trumbull College dining room. In the beginning no one could move. Rumors of liquor and hors d'oeuvres at some far corner swept through the crowd.
"Arthur Schlesinger is here."
"Yes, I know. There he is," said a girl, unfortunately pointing to host Ronald Dworkin, master of Trumbull, who was deep in conversation with Frederic March.
"Celebrities always stick together," the girl added with some bitterness.
"Isn't that Robert Osborn with the white hair talking to John Hersey and his wife? I told him I loved reading the Vulgarians, and he told me he didn't write it," sighed Estelle Parsons, twisting her handkerchief.
"He wasn't telling the truth, was he?"


At the party, Newman sat with his own party by the door. The former Yale Drama School student drank beer, chewed gum, and practiced the fine art of not looking at five thousand people who were looking at him. His was the only group sitting, and he sat with his back to the crowd.
"Hey, listen, I went right up to him and said, if I don't do it now, I'll never do it."
"Yeah, yeah, what did he say?"
"Then I said, my name is Henry Winkler, and I'm a first-year acting student and did you do any editing or cutting for Cool Hand Luke. I asked if he had anything to do with that last awful sequence of Luke smiles."
"He shook my hand and said, pleased to meet you and said, no, I just acted and split."
"Betsy, where is Truman Capote?" asked a professor.
"Truman didn't invite us, so we didn't invite him," said Betsy Dworkin.
"The play? Oh, of course the play is great. Everyone says so. All the people who look like people you should recognize, they're big Broadway types. They love it. Heller's got a bit."
"Mr. Heller, I think you have a bit."
"Oh, yeah. Good. Meet my daughter Erica. I gotta run."
"Well, confidentially, I never thought he'd make it," said Erica.
"Who? Make what?"
"My father. I never thought he'd make it through the production. Didn't he look crazy when they made him come up on stage for a curtain call? He'll be impossible to live with after all this."
"I think the liquor is going to run out before I find out which one is Kurt Vonnegut," mourned a graduate student whose moustache was soaked with good Scotch.
"Look, give up. Bill Styron is here someplace," answered his friend, "and all my girl wants to do is stand here by the door and watch Paul Newman. She won't even talk to him. Just makes me stand here watching her watch Paul Newman."
"Bob and I had 27 people to dinner tonight, and all of a sudden Bob says, have to get over to Batten for services. Twenty-seven people and opening night and he has to go over for the protest," Norma Bruster laughed ruefully to Reverend Coffin.
"Jim, you mean you actually asked him for his autograph? You're crazy. You're drunk. What did he say?"
"He said the same thing to me that he said to the girl who asked him before I did. He said Jesus Christ I oughta smash your face in or something like that."
"Let me see what he wrote-Best Wishes to Mary, Paul Newman. Well, he signed it, all right."
"Look, he's leaving."


And then Paul Newman showed that the actor, even the star, can still use a good director. For his finale, he strained for the nonchalance of the ringleader, the tough kid who knows, and has to pretend he doesn't, that everybody's watching and waiting for him to show how cool he is. Newman picked up an unopened Budweiser, pulled his custom-tailored gray pants away from his custom-tailored stomach, and slipped the can down into the front of his pants. Then he grinned. And everybody saw that he wasn't really that tough guy. He was just some rich kid sneaking free booze away from a deb party in Westport.


But he didn't lose the crowd. They still loved him. After all, it was a hip move. He could get a whole can of beer just for the asking. He was Paul Newman. Anyway, he was killing himself for the effect. The can was cold.

Bombed

Joseph Heller's first assault upon the stage was a welcome step toward the engaging contemporary drama that Yale's resident audience has been led to expect, though not to find, at the new Repertory Theater. The December performance was a contrast to the earlier, uninspired presentation of a "classic" work which gained nothing from the meeting of the two perspectives of past and present-a confrontation that can so easily result in no perspective at all. The company still needs better overall scripts, but it is certainly now fair to say that it deserves them. The group handled the play with as much competence and imagination as could be expected of any company in the United States. Mr. Arrick continued on page 14

minds of several young army officers, and 
on January 15, 1966, they conducted a 
successful coup designed to end the 
feudalistic anachronism and establish a 
truly national government at Lagos. The 
leader of the Northern Region, Sardauna 
of Sokoto, and his Prime Minister at 
Lagos, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, were 
assassinated. 

The North feared this coup as an 
Eastern attempt to gain control of the 
entire federation. lbos were blamed. While 
the officers that led the coup bad members 
of all peoples, a large number were from 
the most nationalistic: Ibo. An lbo became 
head of the Supreme Military Council. 
Major General Aguiyi-Ironsi, born in the 
North, Hausa-speaking, and above all 
dedicated to a united Nigeria, received a 
reputation based on only one charac-
teristic-being an lbo. 

Tensions rose. The lbos living in the 
North ridiculed the death of Sard.auna and 
defiled photographs of him. The abstract 
and non-human terms in which North-
erners spoke of Ibos gained in venom 
and frequency. Stories of lbo greed and 
cunning saturated the North. Rumors of 
lbos smuggling in guns to enslave the 
Nqrth grew malignantly. 

Tensions boiled over on May 24, 1966, 
when to insure national unity Ironsi issued 
a decree abolishing regions entirely. Living 
in Sa bon Gari, the Ibos were easy prey, 
and massacres erupted in five Northern 
cities. 

"Some were decapitated. Others bled to 
death after their arms, legs, and testicles 
were chopped off. Old men and boys had 
their eyes gouged out. Pregnant women's 
bellies were ripped open. Children were 
shot in their parents' presence," wrote 
Claire Sterling in the Reporter (August 10, 
1967). 

Laz lost a cousin in this pogrom. Thou-
sands of Northern Ibos fled to the East. 
The Ibo leader of the Eastern Region, 
Lt. Col. Odumegwu Ojukwu, a dedicated 
nationalist, asked the refugees to go back 
to their jobs in the North. Placing national 
unity first, Ojukwu realized that the North 
would face economic collapse if the Ibos 
who held the vital jobs evacuated. What 
Ojukwu terms the "last act of faith for 
that (nationalist) faith" ended in disaster. 

A counter-coup in July killing Aguiyi-
Ironsi catalyzed another pogrom. Every 
Ibo officer found in the Northern military 
capital was murdered. In this butchery 
Laz lost 210 former classmates. The new 
commander, Yakubu Gowon, symbolized 
the North's regain of control over the 
shreds of a nation. 

Refugees flocked to the East. "A 
woman, mute and dazed, arrived back in 
her village after traveling for five days 
with only a bowl in her lap. It held the 
head of her child, severed before her eyes. 
Another woman steped off a refugee lorry, 
her face battered. By her side was her little 
boy, one of whose eyes had been gouged 
out, and her little girl who had severe 
scalp wounds. 'What,' she kept repeating, 
'has haP.pened to my baby?' It had been 
tied to her back before she was knocked 
to the ground," wrote Colin Legum of 
the exodus (Africa Reports, November, 
1966). 

The pattern of federal unity had become 
a scattered jigsaw puzzle. In an emergency 
conference in September, 1966, Gowon 
made a last-ditch effort to piece it together. 
He proposed a loose association of 
autonomous states, economically inter-
dependent and joined by customs unions 
and public services. All parties united, 
ephemerally. For unknown reasons the 
North abandoned the proposals after its 
own leader had proposed them. The once 
bright hope of a united Nigeria dimmed 
a shade more. 

The remaining Ibos in the North were 
hunted down and maimed or murdered f 
on September 29, 1966, in a third pogrom 
actively led by Northern police and 
troops. Schools and hospitals associated 
with Ibos were sack~d and destroyed. 

But the dim hope of a united Nigeria 
Sl 
had not yet been extinguished. In the fint 
days of 1967, leaders from all factions llll! It
in Aburi, Ghana, in an astoundingly sue¬∑ 
A
cessful conference. Gowon agreed to 
n: 
finance the resettlement of lbo refugees, 
f2 
and all sides agreed to the loose economic 
pr 
association previously proposed. 

Again the glimmer of hope was to be 
l'
doused. The senior officers of the NoJ;then 
1'1 
civil service, more interested in immediatt p
benefits than a viable federation, opposed 
L
these proposals, known as the Aburi 
ll 
Agreements. Controlling all federal powr~ D
at Lagos, they showed reluctance to yield 
11
it. While Gowon's control over his bureatt J
crats may have been more than nominal, 
a
it was not strong enough. Reneging upon 
the A buri Agreements in March, 1967, 
tl 
the federal government extinguished all 
r 
hope of a united Nigeria. 

The East, now well acquainted with 
f 
disappointment, stood ready to act and 
I
seceded. Thinking that the war, which 
broke out shortly thereafter, would take 
a week to crush, Gowon obviously had 
no conception of the fierce Biafran espiri~ 
for the war rages on today. Biafrans fight 
for an idea as well as for their very exist-
ence: a combination not eastly over-
whelmed by larger numbers or better 
equipment. 

"This is a popular and patriotic war, 
waged by people who feel that their sur: 1 
vi val is quite literally at stake .... A nattoo 
has been bqrn and will in some form 
endure. There is reality about the birth 
of Biafra," wrote Conor Cruise O'Brien 
in the Observer (October 8, 1967). 

"As long as there is one living Biafran,¬∑ 
Laz said, "there will be a Biafra." 

The British are the most culpable of 
aU parties. They support federal troops 
to frustrate the emergence of African 
intelligence. Henderson thinks the British 
prefer a docile, tradition-oriented, depen¬∑ 
dent people to an independent, educated, ~ 
self-assertive people who might compete ‚Ä¢ 
with business interests. They not only 
condone, but actively support the whole-
sale slaughter of an entire race to promote 
selfish economic interests. Britain isolates 
the most Western-oriented nation in 
Africa. 

Only one more in a long list of tragic 
ironies is that Britain finds herself on 
the same side as the Soviet Union, which 
aids the Lagos government as a natural 
extension of Arab bloc support. 

. 
The worst aspect of Britain's position IS 
that it prevents her aUies from aiding 
Biafra. With Russia and all Moslem coun-
tries supporting Lagos the only side that 
could support Christian Biafra is silenced. 
While the United States is diplomaticallY 
obligated to be neutral, genocide some¬∑ 
how seems at least as important as 
neutrality. Henderson and other memberS~ 
of the Committee for Biafran Refugees 
have appealed to the State Department to 
take a more active part in attempting to 
end the violence. The official response ha5 
been that any U.S. efforts to encourage 
negotiations would be rejected as inter¬∑ 
ference in Nigeria's internal affairs and 
MID unfriendly act. With British and 
1 
Soviet aid pouring into Lagos, the charge 
:t ofiDterference would seem to be little 
more than a semantic game. But since 
Britain is her closest ally, the U.S. is in an 
e embarrassingly touchy situation. And, of 
coune, there's Vietnam.

1be press performed a disservice to 
lbe American people and an abominable 
iajuatice to the Biafrans in covering the

lbol may hang upon the feelings of the 
American people. Today few Americans 
realize there is a war in which 14 million 
flee death, and that is the fault of the

When hostilities erupted, the New 
Yorl Times had reporters in both 
er. Nileria and Biafra. Understanding the 
It! 
pliabt of the lbos, the Biafran reporter, 
id 
Lloyd Garrison, wrote, "Like a beleagured 
faoael, Biafra will fight back. It will have 
ffS aothing to lose. For the Ibo it will be 
d 
lllrYival or death" (New York Times, 
11!-
J~me4, 1967). Garrison was withdrawn 
caJuly 21 and not replaced. So ended 
Ill)' aemblance of balanced coverage in 
tbeNew York Times. The remaining 
reporter in Lagos, Alfred Friendly Jr., 
ICCOrding to Henderson "swallowed the 
fedenJ position whole." Friendly, 
Heoderson believes, was contained by the 
federal government at Lagos and was 
IIDible to do much more than rewrite that 
~&Wemment's hand-outs. 

Friendly remains the only Times re-
parter in Nigeria. In at least one instance, 
lbe Times reported the fall of a Biafran 
town to federal troops when it was still in 
Biafran control. Some very recent articles, 
bo.ever, suggest that Friendly is 
'-~inning to become disaffected with the 
federal side. 

-r'ime seems to be running out for 
tbe ~eeessionist lbo regime," began a 
Tllltes editorial of August 6. Yet on 
Auaust 13 the Times expressed dis-
appointment that federal troops weren't 
"'iibtening the noose" fast enough and 
Cbat Biafrans were taking the offensive. 

Upset at this coverage, Henderson 
wrote Graham Hovey, a member of the 
Tlllte.r' editorial board who deals with 
II 
African affairs, accusing him of "dis-
a-
flartin& a complex situation in which a 
'Wily large number of human lives are at 
‚Ä¢ llake." Since an interchange of ideas 
between Henderson and Hovey, the 
editorial position of the Times has 
e 
'.'Ofved to the point of urging negotia-
s 
lioaa, while still opposing any form of 
lleaaion. 

On Thanksgiving Day Laz and 100 
fellow Biafrans demonstrated in front of 
the New York Times editorial offices to 
PIOteat the Timrs' treatment of the war. 
Siace that day there has been no editorial 
llleluion of the war. 

Tbe Times' distortion results from 
Clrryiog the rational amoral ism of 
IIOliti<:s too far. "Biafra cannot win. The 
ltiatran.s simply must give up secession and 
Deeotiate for a highly autonomous East 
Central State," said Graham Hovey in a 
!dePphone interview last week. While in a 
3.11( &arne of Diplomacy this would be 
.._correct move, it fails to take into 
IOQount the personal determination of a

-.":Jbere are no conditions for reuniting.

Plaple who are fighting for their lives." ‚Ä¢

The director's event: 
interview with Arthur Penn 
by Robert Edelstein and 
Martin L. Rubin 

Robert Edelstein, a senior in Yale College 
and chairman of the Yale Film Society, 
directed Sally's Hounds, shown at Yale 
last fall, and is presently working on a 
new film, The Girl with No Name. 

Martin Rubin, a junior in Yale College, 
is vice president-treasurer of the Yale 
Film Society. 

The release of Bonnie and Clyde has con-
firmed Arthur Penn as the most talented 
American film director to emerge in the '60's, 
clearly outdistancing such other aspirants as 
Stanley Kubrick (Dr. Strange/ave), Mike 
Nichols (The Graduate), Robert Mulligan 
(Up the Down Staircase), or Sidney Lumet 
(The Pawnbroker). 

Like most recent film-makers, Penn started 
out in the perilous training grounds of New 
York television and theater. Working mostly 
with producer Fred Coe, his early TV experi-
ence included "The Colgate Comedy Hour" 
and "First Person." H is first major theater 
production was William Gibson's Two for the 
Seesaw in 1957. At this time, he and Coe 
became interested in Gibson's The Miracle 
Worker, which resulted in the successful 
"Playhouse 90" production and, later, a long-
run Broadway show, directed by Penn. Other 
notable plays Penn has directed on Broadway 
include Toys in the Attic, All the Way Home, 
An Evening with Nichols and May, Golden 
Boy and Wait Until Dark. His previous films 
include The Left-handed Gun (1959), The 
Miracle Worker (1961), Mickey One (1965) 
and The Chase (1965). 

Bonnie and Clyde (1967) has been, except 
for the pathetic dissent of Bosley Crowther, 
the most critically acclaimed film of the year. 
Thr interview which follows centers mainly 
on this film. Despite the critical attention it 
has received, the film has been largely mis-
interpreted. We hope that this interview will 
clear up some of these misconceptions, most 
notably those of critics who insist that the 
film is an attempted recreation of the Dust 
Bowl era and/or the story of a budding AI 
Capone and his bloodthirsty moll. It should be 
noted that the themes and style of Bonnie and 
Clyde were developed in Penn's previous four 
films, and this interview touches upon them to 
illustrate that point. In short, Bonnie and 
Clyde bears more relation to The Left-Handed 
Gun than to either The Grapes of Wrath or 
Little Caesar. 

Penn, now forty-five years old, is pre-
paring the script for his next film, Little Big 
Man, based on the novel by Thomas Berger. 
He bas planned no other projects beyond this 
one. He continues to direct in theater, al-
though the disastrous experience of How Now, 
Dow Jones has made him wary of Broadway, 
and he will be running the Berkshire Play-
house in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, this 
summer. This interview was conducted at 
Penn's office on Broadway in November, 
1967, three months after the release of 
Bonnie and Clyde. 

I n your films, you seem to be concerned 
with individuals who want to shape their 
lives in their own way, outside of society. 
Yet these characters come to violent, 
tragic ends. Aren't you concerned about 
any other character types? 

I would say, almost categorically, that 
the only people who really interest me 
are the outcasts from society. The 
people who are not outcasts--either 
psychologically, emotionally, or 
physically-seem to me to be subject 
for material for buying breakfast food, 
but they're not subject for material for 
films. 

My characters don't always end 
violently, if you bear in mind that Helen 
Keller figures in this configuration of 
outcasts. Quite the reverse happens. 
What I'm really trying to say through 
the figure of the outcast is that a society 
has its mirror in its outcasts. A society 
would be wise to pay attention to the 
people who do not belong in it in order 
to find out what Its configuration is and 
where it's falling. 

In The Chase and in Bonnie and Clyde, at 
least, the fates of these characters seem to 
get progressively darker . They seem more 
and more hopeless in their ability to make 
these lives which they wish to lead last .... 

Well, I don't think there's anything like 
an even battle between the outcast and 
his society. It isn't an even battle at all. 
What I really am sensing Is that this is 
the only fight these people can fight. 
The odds are clearly against them as, I 
think, the odds are clearly against the 
Negro in the civil rights movement 
today. The odds have always seemed 
to be, as far as I can figure, against 
the people who seem to be on the 
right side. 

In a certain sense, it's a kind of 
revolutionary position. I mean to say, 
my sympathies lie with that man or 
woman who's outside society and 
cannot accommodate himself to it and 
may have to lose his life in order to 
change that society. 

Towards the end of Bonnie and Clyde, 
Bonnie tells Clyde that she's "got the 
blues," that at one point she had thought 
they were "going somewhere,'' and now 
she wonders if they are going anywhere. 
Are they? 

No. I'm not holding up Bonnie and 
Clyde as particularly Interesting out-
casts nor as outcasts who have an 
intention or a continuing motivating 
line. I don't think they did. I think they 
were wandering, hopeless people. 

But I think it was a wandering, hope-
less time. The time Itself didn't know 
where it was going. It was a peculiarly 
naive time, horrible as It was. The 
Depression was peculiarly naive. The 
banks did naive things. They foreclosed 
as many farms as they possibly could, 
leaving the land without anyone to 
farm it, which promptly broke the 
banks. 

Everyone seemed to have a sense of 
destination, and yet when they came 
to confront their lives, the discovery 
was that the sense of destination had 
departed. They found they were simply 
engaged in acting out whatever roles 
they had set in motion originally. 

In the film, it was very Important for 
me to have at least Bonnie understand 
that she was no longer acting out of 
the early promises of Clyde like, " I'm 
going to dress you up, and we're going 
to go to the fanciest restaurants." 
There was no longer that, and they 
were down to a very threadbare basis. 
This was, however, her only place for 
existence-with him and in doing 
these things. She was perfectly willing 
to accept that, knowing that death was 
implicit in it and liable to come at any 
time. In that sense, it was an existential 
realization, and it was an important 
one forme. 

These outcasts are often f am ous criminal!. 
01 
such as Billy the Kid and Bonnie and 
Clyde, and they seem to attract hero-
worshippers. I'm thinking particularly of 
I'
lr
the Hurd H atfield character in L eft-
H anded Gun and C. W. Moss in Bonnie 
and Clyde. Why should criminals become 
idols? 

I think that outcasts who become 
prominent immediately have satellite& 
who idolize them. It Is In a certain sente 
a part of the bizarre character of the 
world that these outcasts find their 
111
historians and documentarians in thea 
s1 
idolators.

In the character of Hurd Hatfield in 
Lett-Handed Gun,* I was really trying 
to say that he was constantly con-
fronted with a myth that he contained 
in his head about who Billy the Kid .was. 
His grave disappointment at who Billy 
the Kid actually was in fact and his 
inability to reconcile those two caused 
him eventually to betray Billy. 

It was the need to have heroes be 
genuinely heroic that seems to me to 
be an absurdity and a foolish Intention, 
and when somebody like the Hatfield 
character is failed In that, there's no 
end to his retaliation, no limit to his 
revenge.

C. W. Moss does not fall in the same

*Penn's first film, The Left-Handed Gun 
(1959), a unique rendering of the myth of 
Billy the Kid, was initially received coldlY . 
in this country but was critically successful Ill 
Europe. In the film, Billy (Paul Newman), a 
childlike outlaw, is befriended by a lcindlY 
Scottish cattleman. When the Scotsma.n is 
murdered, Billy tracks down the killers and 
brutally avenges the death of his friend. He 
is protected by Pat Garrett and a Mexican 
blacksmith. He alienates both of them by 
disrupting the former's wedding and sleepin! 
with the latter's wife. BiUy is finally betrayed 
by an itinerant huckster (Hurd H atfield) wbO ; 
had once idolized him. Trapped, Billy for¬¢ 
Pat Garrett to shoot him by drawing on an 
empty holster and dies suicidally. In this firSI 
film, Penn's preoccupation with physical 
violence and his flair for striking visual 
effects which seem to miraculously stay on 
the right side of obviousness are already 
clearly apparent.

In that sense, it has a certain re-

One of the most lyrical scenes in Bonnie 
Mil Clyde occurs when the two finally 
deep together, and it comes so late in the 
picture so close to their destruction. Why 
there? 

rm not entirely sure that was a right 
Mig to have done .‚Ä¢. I mean, that we 
IIIN them sleep together, consummate 
ll'llatlonship which¬∑we've been offer-
lit ‚Ä¢ one which was, at least to a siz-
lllle degree, predicated on Impotence 
‚Ä¢ his part. But It seemed to me that a 
CNdlble case could have been made 
aut for a man who, having been terrified

‚Ä¢ID be perhaps so unthreatenlng that 
.. might conceivably be able to con-
li!lllnate a relationship with her. 

.... t's open to quarrel, and some 
ve quarrelled with It for being 
ly romantic. It might Indeed 
nder some sort of scrutiny. I 
re we were making a sexual 
e that quite probably might 
--~up. 

. 

lut we were also saying something 
~ ..... Now how obscL!re this 1._1 would 
lll .. ftrst to recognize Its obscurity. 
Ole of the Intentions we had when 
WMt out to do this picture was to 
., Look, up until now, at least in 
llaiiiWOOd pictures, and more true 
._In Hollywood, the entire sexual

JIU lnally break through whatever

The other thing, which Is ~err ob-
ICUre and which I don't know If you

tlhich has some meaning to me, 
11'-t there Is a certain, It seems to

;:-In any way to make that explicit, 
‚Ä¢ least It's something that was 
operating for me as a demonstration of 
an ultimate naivete In this outcast. 
But he does die .. .. 

He does d/e, he does die. I mean, we 
were not in that sense trying to alter 
that kind of fantasy. If anything, we 
were substantiating the mythic char-
acter of it: So and so did so and so; 
he climbed Mount Olympus ‚Ä¢.‚Ä¢ and he 
died. It runs In mythology as rather a 
common form. Prometheus brought life 
and then was chained to the mountain 
and had his liver torn out. 

There is a consequence to those 
kinds of deeds that Is Greek, that runs 
back, and it Is more than Greek-It's 
mythic. I think people endow mythical 
characters with those capacities: both 
to ascend the heights and aJso to be 
levelled again, once again. 

I would say, though, that every man 
has his own periods when he seems to 
ascend the heights, but the general 
experience afterwards is quite a lonely, 
desperate, pessimistic one. 

About this love and death theme-do you 
think there's a similar and even more 
explicit situation in uft-Handed Gun? 
When Billy first makes love to the girl, he 
walks away, turns around, and pretends 
he's drawing a gun. When he dies, he 
makes the same gesture, the pretense of 
shooting a gun. 

Yes, yes. It was the aame character, 
the same sexual character, in that pic-
ture as in Bonnie and Clyde. You're the 
first one to see It, but that was the truth. 
But It was associated, It is associated 
for me with the outcast character.lt Is 
related In that sense to the man who 
perhaps would view entry into the 
woman as entry Into society-as a kind 
of relaxation of his abilities to remain 
out at the edge. The edge of his anti-
social desires might be blunted by that 
sexual act. 

It's meant to be true In both cases, 
since both Billy and Clyde are outlaws 
-different, let me aay, from The 
Chase, where I didn't think of Bubber 
as an outlaw. 

Why does Bubber come home after his 
escape from prison? There seems to be a 
sort of blind force driving him towards 
that town. 

I don't know. I don't really have an 
answer to that. We didn't have a good 
answer to that for a whole year. We 
kept raising the lasue, but we could 
never really resolve it properly for our-
selves. We spoke a lot of bullshit about 
It, but none of It really held water, and 
it doesn't hold water on the screen. It's 
not true, just not true at all. 

Do you think there's a similar blind force 
driving, let's say, M ickey One or Bonnie 
and Clyde? 

No. Bonnie and Clyde have a very 
specific force driving them. They set 
up a set of circumstances, and the 
circumstances eventuate In something 
beyond their expectations, which 
throws them outside of the law. 

Mickey‚Ä¢ was a very different char-
acter in that sense. There's only one 
force driving Mickey. I wish there'd 
been more. The one force for Mickey 
was the feeling of having become the 
outcast and wanting to re-enter. The 
only thing he couldn't stand was to be 
outside of society. That was intolerable 
to him-to have the anonymity, the 
identltyless-ness. In that sense, Mickey 
is a less interesting and, for me, less 
heroic character than either Billy or 
Bonnie and Clyde. 

There seems a certain romantic attitude in 
the way you approach the relationship of 
Bonnie and Clyde and of Bubber and his 
wife, Anna, in The Chase. 

Well, I don't think the Bubber-Anna 
relationship can really be compared 
with the one between Bonnie and 
Clyde. I think, In very simple terms, that 
Bubber came home to commit suicide ‚Ä¢ 
He had no ego left. He had no real 
destiny left. And he knew that that re-
lationship with his wife was, to all 
intents and purposes, non-existent. So 
he came home, and it was a suicidal 
act. 

I don't think that was true of Bonnie 
and Clyde. I don't think they were 
motivated out of a suicidal desire. 
They were motivated out of a more 
naive view of the world: that better 
things could be achieved. That she 
could wear a silk dress and go into the 
Adolphus Hotel. That he could set to 
rights the poor, foreclosed farmer. 
That he could, In a sense, level out part 
of the injustices of his society. The 
thing finally escalated quite out of their 
control; that Is the sadness of lt. But I 
wouldn't compare them as couples at 
all. 

*Mick~y On~ (1965), Penn's third film. 
deals with a successful nightclub comedian 
(Warren Beatty) who is suddenly and inexpli-
cably threatened by a nameless crime and 
faceless mob. He runs away and tries to bury 
himself in the slums of Chicago, working in 
honky-tont dives. He is asked to audition for 
a spot in a classier nightclub. but, thinking 
this to be an effort by the mob to draw him 
out of hiding. he again ftees. After a 
cathartic beating. he returns to face the 
audition, pre;~;ided over by a huge, blinding 
spotlight. and frees himself of his anxieties.

8 I The New JoumaiiJanuary 21, 1968 
I was really talking about an infantile 
sense of justice, a kind of pre-Oedipal 
sense of justice: an inability to recon-
cile the fact that someone had really 
slept with his mother, so that these men 
were constantly transgressors. They 
were contantly failing his system of 
justice, his unbearable system of jus-
tice. At the end of the picture, he then 
becomes the transgressor. The act of 
sleeping with the woman, the wife of 
the man who has been his protector, Is 
his way of sealing his own fate by do-
Ing the very act for which he has been 
punishing people all through the film. 

A very powerful, almost cathartic violence 
runs through both The Chase and Bonnie 
and Clyde whenever these outcast char-
acters are confronted by the society from 
which they're running away or trying to 
change. Is this violence a significant ele-
ment within the films? 

Yeah, within the films and within me. I 
think that I would like to knock a lot of 
heads together, a lot of heads, and 
that's how I do it. I think that society 
could use a lot of heads knocked 
together. 

Your films give a very strong sense that 
this is the only way it can be done. 

I'm afraid that's what I believe, sad to 
say. I mean, I believe in all kinds of 
pacific means, but if you really search 
deeply, I don't have a great deal of be-
lief that they will work. I do have a cer-
tain belief that muscle will work, that 
some heads knocked together will 
work. 

Whenever I've seen the need for 
social change, and I see it-we see It 
all the time, it seems to me that the 
defenders of the status quo are the 
most resilient, Impenetrable bastions. 
It's so difficult to ever assault them 
that I find a certain persuasion in 
those people who counsel violence, 
who really act with a certain violence. 
I'm thinking now of the Negro situation 
in the civil rights movement today. 

Up to a certain point I believe In the 
marches and the non-violence, but I 
have to say that, at this point, 1 do not 
have much faith In them. I mean, when 
I see the faces of the fat, grinning 
sheriffs in Philadelphia, Mississippi, 
reason departs. Alii want to do is get 
one of my heroes out of the movie to 
let 'em have it! 

Your style often reflects this violence. 
For instance, the opening of Bonnie and 
Clyde is technically rather spectacular. 
Wbat were you trying to achieve in those 
very jarring, oppressive close-ups at the 
beginning--of Bonnie undressing and 
coming to the window and later of Bonnie 
and Clyde after they meet? 

It didn't have a great deal of meanjng 
to me. It was really a technique choice. 
At the beginning I thought: where I 
really want to open up and see the 
landscape is when the two of them 
get together and get in the car ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ and 
head out I That's really where 1 want to 
see what field it is that they're operat-
ing on. Previous to that, the only field, 
it seems to me, Ia the look in the eye, 
the shape of the lips and how it goes 
around a coke bottle .‚Ä¢‚Ä¢. So I just de-
cided to get in there as close as we 
possibly could. That was really a fairly 
simpl‚Ä¢minded choice. 

You seem to be preoccupied by cars. Key 
scenes in both Mickey One and The Chase 
are set in auto junkyards, and Bonnie and 
Clyde takes place almost exclusively in 
cars. Do you see these vehicles as symbols 
of modern life? 

No, I really don't. There are two things 
at work. The junkyard in The Chase is 
really a wholly personal prejudice of 
mine. I live in the country, and when-
ever I drive up I keep seeing these 
things growing larger and larger. 

I think of them as a festering sore that 
Is absolutely unbearable to behold. 

I mean there's a town called Craryville, 
New York, a sweet, innocent little town. 
I would say that probably one-quarter 
of it is now covered with automobile 
bodies rusting, which struck me as a 
terribly disgusting sight. 

VIsually, It was a disgusting sight. 
So when we were trying to think of a 
place for the ending of The Chase, that 
one seemed natural to me, where I 
could get two things off at once. One 
was a kind of jungle feeling which was 
absolutely necessary, whatever the 
jungle equivalent would be for this 
society. The automobile junkyard 
seemed to me to be a very apposite 
symbol for it. And so, in that rather 
simpl‚Ä¢minded way, it suggested itself, 
and at the same time I got rid of a great 
deal of the hostilities I had towards 
Craryville, New York. 

The case in Bonnie and Clyde is 
rather different. That has a certain 
historical base. As one of the more 
sympathetic observers said about 
Bonnie and Clyde (the real Bonnie and 
Clyde, not the characters in the film), 
they were Invented by the V-8 engine. 
In a certain sense, that was true. When 
Ford came out with the V-8'a the major-
ity of the police still had the old 6's, the 
old Model T's and Model A's. Bonnie 
and Clyde would inevitably steal a 
V-8, a powerful car which could permit 
them not only to outrun the police of 
any local community but also to move 
across state borders. 

That was their pattern. It was not 
unusual for them to drive seven and 
eight hundred miles a night. They were 
peregrinating souls on a very desperate 
level, and right at the head of It was 
that engine that was really driving 
them. 

So that's what prompted us in 
Bonne and Clyde to rely on the auto-
mobile. It also became their province. 
The inside of the automobile became 
their home. They would pick up people 
and drive them several hundred miles 
for conversation and society. That's 
why we included the scene of the un-
dertaker and his girl in the film. Bonnie 
and Clyde picked them up because 
they had nobody else to talk to. 

How real is the world in which Bonnie 
and Clyde are living? Do you think such a 
completely self-shaped existence is pos-
sible any more? 

I don't think it was possible even then. 
We delineated a world which Isn't an 
actual documentary vision of the world 
as It was then. We stripped away almost 
all the extraneous details we could. 
The visual essence of the picture Is 
what it leaves out, for the most part. 
This barrenness was extremely Inten-
tional. 

I don't think for a minute that we 
were creating any kind of world as 
world, I mean, any kind of society as 
society. We were creating It only as 
two narcissistic, mutually-Involved kids 
might view It, which Is really as a series 
of targets or objects--or simply as 
specific downtrodden people who 
might motivate Bonnie and Clyde to 
attack the targets. The movie Is in that 
sense an abstraction rather than 
genuine reportage. 

I think I meant more specifically the 
characters of Bonnie and Clyde and the 
way they chose to live: this robbing of 
banks and then running away. How long 
could this actually keep going? The use 
of the poem, the legend of Bonnie and 
Clyde-there seems something mythic 
about their existence. 

Oh, I think they had a strong mythic 
sense about themselves. Anyway she 
surely did. I don't think he did. I think 
he was kind of a clod. Even though her 
ballads are doggerel, they show she 
has a certain ability to confront her 
situation in a more honest way than 
he was ever able to do. 

I don't know, I suppose they could 
have gone on robbing banks. They 
were petty thieves at heart. They were 
not killers. J. Edgar Hoover may take 
exception, but I don't think of them as 
killers. I don't think they set out with 
that intention. They really set out to 
level things out a little bit. The banks 
had the money; they didn't have the 
money. And that just didn't seem right 
to them. So they decided to get a little 
bit of it. 

In the course of getting a little bit of 
it, they attracted C. W. Into their orbit. 
He provided the ridiculous instrument 
by which they then created their first 
murder. Having created it, they were 
committed to a course of action that 
was really larger than they were. 

Murder is in a certain sense bigger 
than these two characters. They're 
more thieves than murderers. They had 
no noble Intentions of deposing some 
kind of reigning monarch or setting 
evil to rights. They killed accidentally, 
and they continued to kill accidentally. 

There also seems a certain accidental, 
indifferent manner in the way they them-
selves get killed. There is something fright-
ening in the expression of that Texas 
Ranger, so cold, so indifferent, and it 
just seemed to happen. Even the way 
the film ends seems to reflect this. It just 
stops, rather than coming to a more 
obvious, dramatic resolution. 

Yea, the mood of the ending was very 
intentional. It was an affectless death. 
Sheriff Hamer himself didn't have any 
strong feeling about them. He wasn't 
operating Inside any code or system of 
honor or morality. He had his job to do. 
They had their job to do. And that 
seems to me to be about the worst kind 
of killing. One could make a very 
strong case for Adolph Eichmann ex¬∑ 
actly on those terms. 

It seemed to me an excessively 
thorough death. You know-the man 
who summoned all his resources to 
break the butterfly on the rack. It was 
the righteous Indignation of a certain 
segment of society acted out so thatH 
becomes at least as ugly as anything 
the victims of their attack might have 
done themselves. The justice meted 
out by the forces of law and order 
seems to me far worse than the crimes 
that they're avenging, and this was 0111 
of the instances. 

The death of Bonnie and Clyde was 
literally and historically accurate. TM1 \ 
did fire a thousand rounds. There wert 
eighty-seven distinct hits on the bodill 
of Bonnie and Clyde. As recently as 
1946, the car was being toured around 
the Southwest, shown at carnivals: The 
Death Car of Bonnie and Clyde. It's a 
kind of gothic, grotesque behavior, alii 
I would be hard-pressed at this point 
to make any choices, between Sherlft 
Hamer and Bonnie and Clyde, I think 
I'd choose Bonnie and Clyde. 

Do you think that Sherriff Hamer is in thJI 
respect similar to Pat Garrett in The Left¬∑ 
handed Gun? They both seem to bring 
about this justice from completely perS()Illi 
motives. 

Right. Right. I do. I think that the self¬∑ 
righteousness of the arm of justice II 
almost the most dangerous thing thert ‚Ä¢ 
is, because it's unreal. I don't think 
these people understand their own 
motives when they supposedly act 0111 
their acts of justice. I'm not entirely 
sure that I believe that somebody whO 
becomes a policeman has very high 
motives to begin with. 

Historically, a good case could be 
made for the fact that Bonnie and 
Clyde, as national figures, were 
elevated to a kind of artiflcal promi-
nence. They were endowed with chal' 
acteristics that they did not necessarilY 
have, mad-dog killers and so forth. 
This was done for a very specific r..-
son, an historical, constabulatory 
reason. Before that time, acts of justiC' 
were confined within a state. But wHII 
the advent of the V-8 automobile, 
people were able to cross the state 
lines. There became known then the 
' 
need for a national police force. 

The creation of this national pollcl 
was regarded, however, with a great 
deal of suspicion by the members of 
Congress and the people because H 
was absolutely against the spirit of..,

say, perhaps generically, that 
~ut outcasts, probably films 
lltout anybody, have to do with some 
lind of arrested emotional state that's 
-.oclated with a childhood experl-
-. 

Probably the only really adult 
figure in The Chase was Sheriff Calder, 
Marion Brando. He was a man whose 
whole action In the picture was to hold 
onto a mature view and avoid an ln-
fanlte retaliatory-aggressive stance. He 
had to try to cool it as best he could in 
a community which was somewhat In-
fantile In Its views. The sadness of that 
story is that Calder tailed. 

The other sadness Is that we tailed 
Calder. We tailed Brando In the tact 
that we didn't dramatize that nearly 
well enough, and that seems to me to 
be the conspicuous failure of that film. 

It seems to me an interesting character 
*l n The Chase (1965), a high-budget Sam 
Spiegel production, Penn encountered his 
most serious difficulties in completing a film. 
He eventually lost control over the editing, 
and several scenes were re-shot after his 
departure. The film remains, however, one 
of his most impressive achievements, an 
examination of the violence lying beneath the 
surface of a listless Texas town controlled by 
a Big Daddy-like oil baron, Val Rogers (E. G. 
Marshall). The escape of Bubber Reeves 
(Robert Redford) from the state prison aggra-
vates the town's pent-up frustrations, 
complicated by several childhood grudges and 
the fact that Bubber's wife (Jane Fonda) has 
defected to Rogers' son (James Fox). A 
boozed-up Saturday-night mob traps Bubber 
in a junk yard before he is rescued by Calder 
(Marlon Brando), a dedicated sheriff. 
However, Bubber is assassinated before 
Calder can return rum to jail. Rogers' son dies 
as a result of the lynch-mob's violence, and 
Calder, giving the town up for lost, resigns his 
position and leaves. 

and an Interesting motive, and we 
stepped all over our feet trying to get 
that on the screen. I mean, we never 
did. 

In the sense that Calder fails, it seems that 
none of these outcasts, these figures in 
direct conflict with society, are capable 
of really changing it. I think this feeling 
is expressed in the scene in which Bonnie 
and Clyde are shooting outside the aban-
doned house, taken over by the banks. The 
dispossessed farmer and his worker come 
and take several pot-shots at the house. 
T here seems a kind hopelessness in the 
sense that they're firing at it, trying to 
get back at it, but they can't. 

Yes. I don't know that I think outcasts 
or people who engage In these kinds 
of acts of violence can necessarily ef-
fect change. I think, however, that there 
want a foreign language keyboard? 
Special keys for law courses? 
Is no other choice for them. I think they 
have to do that. And I think that only 
with a vision of history can we see that 
maybe, maybe In some nutty way, they 
did really affect change. But at the 
time, I don't think we can ever point to 
change. I mean, more change has prob-
ably been accomplished by Gandhi 
than by Jesse James or William Tell, 
but maybe that's only true in certain cir-
cumstances. In other circumstances, 
sometimes I think people have had to 
go to Spain and fight the tight and lose 
the fight, In order to create a kind of 
conscience tor the rest of us that Is a 
part of us the rest of our lives. In that 
respect It's fortunate that these people 
do their thing. 

We'd like to ask some more technical 
questions now. Your actors are always 
given very strong physical characteriza-
tions. We remember characteristics which 
are very powerfully delineated visually. 
How closely do you work with your actors 
in getting this kind of effect? 

Pretty closely. I really have a lot to do 
with that. I like kinetic behavior; I think 
that's good tor cinema. Kinetic-cinema, 
the two words have the same source. 
I think It's good cinema for some-
body to walk In a certain way and to 
move in a certain way. After all, you're 
showing a distillation. You're showing 
some ninety minutes out of a lifetime, 
so somebody had better come through 
a door In a very particular way, or hit a

desk In a very particular way, or fire a 
gun In a very particular way in order 
for It to be meaningful. 

I studied with Michael Chekhov, who 
was a great believer in the "psychologi-
cal gesture." This is the sense that an 
actor can achieve a good deal of the 
psychology of his character by assum-
Ing some of the physical, external 
aspects of that character. 

I've found this works and I use It 
rather frequently. ! think Warren's limp 
was a very important factor in the 
formation of the character of Clyde ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢. 
the dialect, the whole gait. For 
Instance, Warren always wore that gun 
under his jacket. Whether it was ever 
intended in the scene or not, it was 
always there. He never played a scene 
without it, never, because he felt it was 
so much a part of his character. And 
it did make his suit fit in a certain way; 
it made him stand in a certain way. 

I think It does have peripheral benefits 
that we may not be conscious of, but 
they do help convey character. 

Does this visual factor affect you very 
strongly in casting your roles? 

Oh yes, sure. And why not have 
attractive people? I must say I've come 
a long way. When I first started out, I 
felt films had to be about really 
ordinary-looking people. But by God, 
they're not ordinary; they're sixty feet 
high. That's one incontrovertible fact 
about movie screen, and somebody 
not very attractive and sixty feet tall is 
really ugly. 

How much freedom do you give your 
actors? 

Well, it's always relative. What we try 
to do is to create the climate of 
accident, of controlled accident. 
Thafs really the essence of it. 

Certain things I will set very 
meticulously. Other things I will not 
only set, but I will alter them from take 
to take so as to throw the actors off. 

For Instance, although they're sitting 
in chairs, on the next take maybe one 
chair leg will be a little shorter than 
the others. Something will happen In 
order to cause them to say, "Jesus 
Christ, I'm doing a shot, but at the same 
time this chair doesn't ‚Ä¢ . ‚Ä¢ "They have 
to deal with that fact. It's by way of 
taking them unaware, with some of 
the physical conditions of living, that 
I try to create these accidents. 

How closely do you work with your 
cameraman? 

I set up every shot in the sense that 
I pick the location of the camera, the 
lens, and what It should contain. The 
cameraman (now we're talking mostly 
about Hollywood cameramen) then 
t.akes over and lights that shot. That's 
what their function is: lighting. It's not 
camera movement or camera composi-
tion. And it was at that level that we 
had some philosophical disagreements 
about what the character of a frame 
should be. I'm now talking about 
cameramen other than the last one; I 
don't mean that to be true of Guffey 
(Burnem Guffey, cameraman for 
Bonnie and Clyde). Guffey was the first 
camerrnan I found who, although he 
disagreed with me, at least allowed me 
the belief that there might be some-
thing to what I was saying--how much 
light we could really cut off from a 
scene and still have a scene and how 
light had to be relatively unified in 
source. 

You see, so much has been going 
on in terms of technological change 
in Hollywood. The character of film 
Is so much better; It's so much faster. 
The lenses are so much faster; the 
developing process is so much better. 

On the other hand, the Hollywood 
cameramen are the same cameramen 
who took us from the days of the silent 
film to now. They are men of sixty-five 
or sixty-six who have not really yet 
recognized viscerally the character 
of the material they're working with. 
They take that light meter, and they 
know they've got a lot of light, but 
they'll put a little more light in there 
and a little more light ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢. and pretty 
soon you're Inundated. 

Guffey was very malleable in that 
respect, and I have a high regard for 
him. I have to say he was not always 
with belief or conviction, but he was 
perfectly willing to try it. And very 
often he was gentlemanly enough 
upon seeing the stuff in the dailies to 
say, " My God, that's better than I 
thought. I really didn't think it would 
work, but It did." In that regard, I have 
a sizable estimation of him. 

What do you th ink of the telephoto lens? 
You use it to great effect in Bonnie and 
Clyde. 

Great lens! I'm going to use it more. 
I just have to use it more. I've really 
got the appetite for it. That Is 
something else! We haven't really used 
that at all. I'm really going to use that 
now. Oh boy, that was one of the best 
experiences I've had. 

You're talking about the pan down 
the Arcadia street (to the shot of C. W.'s 
father and Sheriff Hamer sitting in the 
ice cream parlor). That was meat and 
potatoes, meat and potatoes. There 
was a great deal of head-shaking and 
breast-beating about that shot. They 
said, " A 400mm shot! It'll shake, and 
nothing's going to have any depth of 
field ‚Ä¢. .' And all the while I kept saying, 
"Yeah, tell me more, tell me more," 
and, by God, it came out looking just 
the right way. Of course lit's 
sensational dramatically! 

At a certain point, there's a certain 
dramatic event that's only two-
dimensional, and anything else is a 
lie. In this kind of schematic betrayal, 
we weren't Interested In what they 
were specifically saying or what they 
were doing or what was going on. 

It was a pure act, a human act, and it 
should have been as two-dimensional 
as It's possible to get. If I had my 
choice, I'd go back and shoot It on an 
800mm lens, right now. 

It's a very exciting lens, particularly 
to intercut with. Everybody keeps 
saying you can't intercut with It, but 
the reverse, I think, is absolutely true. 
You not only can intercut with it, but 
should. The changes In visual 
experience between that and a lens 
with a great depth of field Is just 
marvelous! I will probably end up using 
that lens a great deal more, maybe 
twenty times more than I have so far. 
I'm already seeing my next picture 
with so many scenes visualized in 
that way. 

Given yc‚Ä¢ur initial story, do you thing you 
see the film very much in terms of the 
shots that go into it? 

What I've discovered is: when I've 
known what I was doing, in Left-handed 
Gun and Bonnie and Clyde, I saw the 
whole movie. Those are the only two 
movies I ever did see before I went to 
a screening. I now have to recognize 
this as a symptom in myself: If I can't 
see it in my mind's eye, something is 
wrong. Something is wrong. Something 
is wrong at least for me, and I will be 
alert to the fact in the future. 

Do you use a Jot of takes in a given scene? 

Yes, I use a Jot of takes, and I print a 
lot of takes--an indecent number-to 
the dismay of every studio that I've ever 
been associated with. But, I mean, if 
you can have an entire life geared to 
the creation of that one piece of film, 
and then at that point you suddenly 
invoke limits, it seems to me the most 
absurd thing in the world. You know, 
you have thousands of acres of wheat-
field, and then when you come to bake 
the bread, you decide it's only going 
to be half a loaf long and that's it. It's 
ridiculous. 

Do you eliminate many scenes in the 
editing of your films? 

No, we don't. In Bonnie and Clyde I 
don't think we eliminated more than a 
minute or a minute and a half. The pic-
ture that's on the screen is the script 
as we shot it. What we eliminated were 
overly explicit utterances where an 
image took care of the idea. 

We began one sequence about five 
speeches Into the scene-the scene 
which ends with his saying, "I would 
live in one state and rob banks in 
another.'' We found that what we had 
viewed In the scene before, where 
they had made love, took care of the 
whole preparation of the followng 
scene. We didn't need It, so we simply 
jumped Into the middle of it. But that's 
all we cut out In Bonnie and Clyde. 

In general, do you think you have as much 
freedom working with studios as you 
wouJd want? Were you able to do as much 
with Bonnie and Clyde as a Warner 
Brothers production as you might have 
wanted to? 

Yes. After the fact, I would have to say 
that we were not limited by the studio 
at all. During the making of It, there was 
always the potentiality that a very 
severe imposition of limits could have 
taken place ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 

I take it this was true of The Chase. 

Yes. It not only could have taken place, 
but it did take place, totally. 

Fortunately, studios are growing up 
now. They are recognizing that tho 
nature of film is changing and that 
they have to give the people who make 
the films the opportunity to put them 
together in their own way. In my next 
film, for instance, I had no difficulty in 
getting the right to cut it in New York, 
the right to cut it in my own way. There 
has been no intereference at all. 

Studios are disappearing as studios 
and becoming what they always have 
been in true character, financing or-
ganizations. They're business organi-
zations, and any pretentlons towards 
the aesthetic are only the reflections of 
some elderly, vain men. 

Do you still enjoy working with theater? 

Yes, I enjoy the theater a lot. I don't 
know that I enjoy working with Broad¬∑ 
way theater; I think it's silly. 

There's something to be learned 
about distillation in theater that's very 
important. Also good actors clearly 
come from the theater. I found Estelle 
Parsons and Gene Hackman at a sum-
mer stock theatre in Stockbridge. 

Do you th ink there's as much room for 
personal expression in theater as in film? 

No. But I don't think there's a great 
deal wrong with not having personal 
expression sometimes. There's some-
thing to be said for technical craft, for 
the ability to elucidate someone else's 
work. 

More and more I'm learning to get 
rid of the disciplines of the theater 
when I'm making a film. In the theater 
the script is embalmed. It Is The Text, 
a revered work. A man's written It, 
and it's meant to be delivered as such. 

In the cinema, the dialogue Is only a 
guide. My good writing friends are 
often offended by the literary level of 
the scripts of my films. On the other 
hand, I keep thinking It doesn't maHer 
a great deal, and I'm sort of offended 
sometimes by the look of their plays. 

There's an awful lot of vanity that's 
inherent In the moviemaking event. It's 
a seductive event. Seldom In one's 
fantasies can one achieve the kind of 
power that you literally have on a 
movie set. Power corrupts; movie 
power corrupts absolutely. Dialogue 
in cinema only serves as a guide to a 
kind of visualization, and if this be 
megalomania, so be it. There is only 
one event In making movies, and that's 
the director's event. It Is not anybodY 
else's. I don't care how well wriHen tht 
script Is. You can go down and get Into 
a motel room in Texas, and the 
dialogue can be exquisite, but what 
you choose to look at and how you look 
at it is everything, everything. I mean. 
I can show you tons of out-takes whert 
I looked at the wrong thing, and I can 
only say that had the movie been made 
up of those out-takes, It would have 
been a dreadful movie. You know, it's 
perfectly possible to not see somethin9 
In the right way. That's the whole thin9: J 
it's really a cyclops experience. You 
get that one glassy eye with which you 
see everything, and that's movies. 


**Title: The Mill-in: of Berkeley and things to come**
**Author: Michael Mandelbaum**

Ul'lbe New Journal I January 21, 1968 
The Mill-in: 
of Berkeley and things to come 
by Michael Mandelbaum 

Michael Mandelbaum, from Berkeley, 
Ctllif., a senior in Yale College, is an 
bu~nsive major in political science. This 
ilhis second appearance in The New 
Journal. 

"One of the most difficult tasks facing t~e 
ChancelJor," according to the Slate Supple-
ment to the General Catalogue, the Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley's widely-
read equivalent of the Yale Course 
Critique, "is that of unifying and infuriat-
ing the students in time for the annual 
Fall STRIKE. We all know how rushed the 
quarter system makes studying, and it bas 
been hard on the Chancellor, too. Al-
though be has been doing a workmanlike 
job, and has even started this task early in 
the summer, he has not yet attained the 
prowess of his predecessors." 

Slate's fears were not borne out. It was 
not even necessary for the University to 
award an honorary degree to Lyndon 
Johnson, Nguyen Cao Ky, or Shirley 
Temple Black, or to name a building after 
the founder of the Dow Chemical Com-
pany, as the Supplement went on to sug-
gest, to ignite a series of disorders which 
have become an annual event on the 
campus since the memorable Free Speech 
Movement of 1964, which was led by 
Mario Savio. These disturbances at Ber-
keley, and those that occured shortly 
afterward across the Bay at San Francisco 
State College, are different from their 
predecessors. The underlying causes and 
the tactics employed are new and disturb-
ing. They bear on the immediate future of 
American student activism, and even of 
American universities themselves. 

Ostensibly, each commotion was a 
response to administrative suspensions, 
issued for allegedly political reasons. In 
Berkeley in early October, students staged 
a large anti-war rally on campus. The 
rally defied a court's injunction, obviously 
designed to stifle protest, which was 
rescinded shortly thereafter. Although he 
disagreed with the injunction, ChancelJor 
Roger Heyns felt obliged to recommend 
that eleven of the rally's organizers be 
suspended. Charging that Heyns sought 
to hinder anti-war activity, and had un-
fairly singled out a few of the several 
thousand who participated in the rally, 
students staged a series of "mill-ins" in 
the administration building. Hundreds of 
students flooded the corridors and offices 
of Sproul Hall. Others kept its telephone 
lines constantly busy, making the normal 
transaction of university affairs impossible. 

San Francisco State is the crown jewel 
of the state college system (distinct from 
the Un\versit)¬∑ of California and its several 
campuses), with a reputation for a bright, 
hip student body and an avant-garde cur-
riculum. Several days after the last of the 
Berkeley mill-ins, State spawned its own 
"Movement Against Political Suspen-
sions." 

President John Surnmerskill had sus-
pended four members of the school's 
Black Student Union, who allegedly had 
assaulted the editor of the campus news-
paper. Several weeks later, a campus 
literary magazine printed an erotic poem 
which, Surnmerskill decided, violated an 
agreement made by the magazine's editor. 
He suspended both the editor and the 
poet. A few days later, admitting that his 
action had been premature, Sumrnerskill 
reinstated the two pending an investiga-
tion. Angered by what they considered a 
racially biac;ed double standard. students 
marched on their administration building. 
Finding it locked, they broke several 
windows and climbed in. No further 
damage ""as done there, but during the 
fracas some black non-students reportedly 
set fires in the campus bookstore and 
looted the cafeteria. Simultaneously, a 
number of fights erupted outside the ad-
ministration building. 

Although the immediate object of stu-
dent wrath in each case was the chief 
campus administrator, a fundamental pro-
vocation was the tedious, omnipresent 
war. For the war in Vietnam is finally 
having a marked effect on the most highly 
educated of those who must tight it. Stu-
dents, particularly older ones, are con-
cerned by the very real threat of the draft 
after graduation; they are frustrated by 
the failure of dissent to have any real 
effect upon an implacable national ad-
ministration with a one-track mind; they 
are angry at the duplicity and hypocrisy 
which have characterized the conduct of 
the war. Thus a climate of malaise and 
hostility has been generated at San Fran-
cisco and Berkeley, in which campus dis-
turbances require very little provocation. 

Berkeley and San Francisco also rep-
resent a temporary detour in the course 
of student opposition to the war; an in-
volution-a turning back on the universitf 
itself. This is in part due to the failure 
of all attempts to in.O.uence the forces 
directly responsible for the conflict. Stu-
dents vent their frustrations on the in-
stitutions closest at hand, and upon which 
they can have the most impact. 

The campus is also a relatively safe 
place to protest, particularly for California 
students, one of whom called it "our 
turf." At military induction centers, 
weapons depots, or even in city streets 
they are subject to the vindictive directives 
of General Hershey and the heavy clubs 
and noxious fumes of unsympathetic 
police. The violence visited upon a group 
attempting to stage a peaceful sit-in in 
Oakland on October 17 of last year (New 
Journal, October 29, 1967) was un-
doubtedly traumatic for many in the 
peace movement in California. 

Accompanying this involution is the 
birth of a new set of tactics, which have 
been particularly evident in Berkeley. A 
mill-in is not strictly illegal. It is a viola-
tion of the public order, not the law. In 
common with the entrapment of rep-
resentatives of the Dow Chemical Com-
pany, it foreshadows a shift from a 
strategy of petition and persuasion to one 
of harassment. Instead of merely asking 
that the war be ended and the university 
be changed, students increasingly are at-
tempting to interfere directly with the 
administration of both. Their actions are 
no longer wholly symbolic. 

Most important of all, participants in 
the mill-ins break radically with the 
strategy of civil disobedience and the 
philosophy behind it. An act of civil dis-
obedience must be commited openly, non-
violently, and with a willingness to accept 
the prescribed consequences. As Herbert 
Kelman points out, it is designed for "a 
restoration of the system's legitimacy 
and integrity, and expresses a faith in the 
society's capacity to be true to its own 
values .... " Participants in a mill-io do 
not make such an affirmation of overall 
legitimacy. They do not announce their 
actions openly, they do not commit them-
-;elves ab~lutely to non-violence, and they 
are unwilling to incure punishment. At the 
first sign of police, they quickly disperse. 

Such tactics accurately reflect a growing 
alienation from the entire structure of 
authority in this country, and an erosion 
of the respect and allegiance it bas norm-
ally commanded. 

The parallel to the tactical history of the 
Black Revolution is striking. Berkeley's 
Free Speech Movement in 1964 borrowed 
the sit-in from the black students who 
began to desegregate the South in the 
early 1960's. A shift of framework-in 
one case from the South to the urban 
ghettoes of the North, in the other from 
the issue of the student's role in the uni-
versity to Vietnam-producing frustration 
and anger, fueled by encounters with 
powerlessness and hypocrisy-bas led in 
both cases to guerrilla tactics of disrup-
tion. The next step for students is the 
concerted use of violence, and that is very 
much in the air in Berkeley. 

The events on campus have catalyzed a 
predictably sharp swing to the right in 
California politics. Not only Governor 
Reagan and Superintendent of Public 
Information Max Rafferty, right-wing 
Republicans with an eye on higher office, 
but even State Assembly Speaker Jesse 
Unruh, the most prominent Democrat in 
the state, sensed political fodder in the dis-
turbances and denounced students and 
administrators. Outraged legislators in 
Sacramento called for campus investiga-
tions and reprisals against "subversives." 
The elements which in the early 1950's 
fostered McCarthy ism are again present: 
a distant, ambiguous, indecisive conflict 
and the absence of vigorous national 
leadership to defend civil liberties. They 
create a political climate in which anti-
intellectualism thrives and attacks on the 
universities are profitable. 

Ultimately the price the United States 
pays for the war may well be the disillu-
sionment and alienation of an entire gen-
eration of students. The most immediate 
domestic casualties, however, are likely 
to be the universities, and particularly their 
administrators. At another time, in an-
other place, Roger Heyns and John 
Summers kill, honorable, able men, might 
be heroes. But it is their job to mediate 
between the students and those holding 
political power, and that is no longer 
possible. 

Nor are these gloomy prospects confined 
to California, as similar events at Wis-
consin and Harvard testify. President 
Kingman Brewster noted the absence 
of such disturbances at Yale when be 
appeared on the "David Susskind Show." 
He credits the general restraint of Yale 
students, and in identifying a relatively 
moderate style of political activity on 
this campus he is no doubt correct. But 
if the specter of Vietnam continues to 
haunt this country, his tum will come. ‚Ä¢

The Insanity Defense, by Abraham Gold-
stein, Yale University Press. 

Abraham Goldstein 

The defendant, who pole-axed his wife, 
claims he was insane at the time. Psy-
chiatrists testify to and fro to that, arguing 
learnedly before the jury whether the ac-
cused is a paranoid schizophrenic, a psy-
chopath or whatever. Finally, the judge 
instructs the jurors to acquit the defendant 
if they find he was indeed insane. 

That, in a cameo, is your standard 
scenario for the insanity defense. The 
drama seems straightforward enough. It's 
not The confusion begins with the in-
structions the judge must give the jury, 
and pinwheels out from there. 

What tests shall the judge instruct the 
jury to apply in deciding whether this de-
fendant should be held accountable for 
his acts? Tabloid readers who follow with 
titillated glee the trials of ax-murderers 
would say, of course, whether the acc.used 
"knew right from wrong." Fleshed out 
with the preliminary question of whether 
he was "under such a defect of reason . . . 
as not to know the nature and quality of 
the act," this is a facsimile of the famous 
M'Naghten rule. In the century or so since 
the English courts abandoned the "wild 
beast" test-which had slipped into the 
law a century or so before that by a 
mistranslation from the Latin of a thir-
teenth-century scholar who wasn't talking 
about the insanity defense anyway-the 
M'Naghten rule has been the test in the 
large majority of states. 

¬∑More recently, a number of states have 
adopted--exclusively or in addition to the 
M'Naghten test-the rule that the accused 
should be found not guilty by reason of 
insanity if he had a mental disease which 
made him unable to control his conduct. 
The American Law Institute, in its pro-
posed Model Penal Code, has combined 
the two-although it carefully changes the 
"know ... " of the M'Naghten to "appre-
ciate" the criminality of his act and the 
"control ... " of the more recent test to 
"conform" his conduct to the requirements 
of the law. The latter change seems sense-
less; the former-because "appreciate" is 
a nuance broader than "know"-is worth-
while. Both, however, assume that the 
twelve good men and true on the jury are 
as sensitive to language as a linguistic 
philosopher. Finally, in 1954 the District 
of Columbia Court of Appeals decided 
that "an accused is not criminally respon-
sible if his unlawful act was the product of 
mental disease or mental defect." Only 
Maine and the Virgin Islands have fol-
lowed the District of Columbia in adopt-
ing this test, but the rule of Durham v. 
United States has inspired a torrent of law 
review articles fretting about the proper 
phrasing of the judge's charge to the jury. 

Now comes Professor Abraham Gold-
stein with his book The Insanity Defense. 
He makes, and documents, two immensely 
valuable points: (1) the precise wording of 
the insanity defense-that is, the language 
with which the judge charges the jury-is 
hardly worth the reams of foolscap de-
voted to it, and (2) the insanity defense 
itself plays but a small role in removing 
men who are in some sense crazy from the 
conveyor belt which carries criminals from 
arrest to arraignment to indictment to 
trial to prison. 

In the movement for new tests of in-
sanity the M'Naghten rule has been 
whipped with remarkable fervor. Its lan-
guage of "knov. ing right from wrong.¬∑¬∑ 
the reformers <ihout, wrongly focuses on 
the misleadingly narrow " cognitive" 
aspects of mental health and r~ on an 
archaically "compartmentalized" concep-
tion of the min d. The critics of the rule 
never tire of pointing to those defendants 
who quite rationally realize both the 
"nature" of their acts and that the com-
munity considers them "wrong," yet who 
kill or rob anyway because of their 
crippled personalities and twisted values. 
Surely, say the critics, we cannot "blame" 
these men or expect them to be deterred 
by the punishment threatened by a society 
of which they feel no part. Moreover, the 
critics argue, the narrow gauge of the 
M'Naghten rule leads judges to refuse to 
admit evidence which, while not showing 
that the defendant did not know right from 
wrong, would present to the jury a rounded 
image of h is mental problems and, hence, 
of his blameworthiness. 

Unlike most of the critics, Professor 
Goldstein has taken the time to read the 
cases and to ponder the extent to which 
the jury will be cowed by the judge's in-
structions. He finds that judges almost 
never refuse to admit any evidence con-
cerning the mental history of the defen-
dant, regardless of its bearing on the 
narrow question of whether he knew right 
from wrong. Moreover, courts are usually 
willing to let psychiatrists testify that 
"know" should not be interpreted in a 
narrow "cognitive" sense but in the broad, 
textured sense of whether the defendant 
understood and appreciated emotionally 
the wrongfulness of his conduct. Most 
important, the jury can and will acquit for 
insanity a defendant who it feels should 
not be condemned, regardless of the 
sonorous formula given it by the judge. 

Having shown that much of the abuse 
heaped upon the M'Naghten rule has been 
unjust, Professor Goldstein applies that 
same treatment to the word-quibbling with 
which reformers have attacked other tests 
they find too narrow, with the same result: 
the words of the rule foUowed by the court 
play almost no role in deciding the critical 
question of what evidence the jury will be 
allowed to bear, and probably as small a 
part in guiding or determining the jury's 
verdict. 

After thus showing the relative unim-
portance of the games lawyers play over 
the wording of the insanity defense, Pro-
fessor Goldstein goes on to show the rela-
tive unimportance of the insanity defense 
itself. Very few defendants plead the in-
sanity defense. The really mad never enter 
the criminal process; the police or the pros-
ecutor shunt them off to the insane asylum 
early in the game. Of those that remain, 
many are found "incompetent" to stand 
trial-
they cannot understand the nature 
of the charges against them, or cooperate 
in their own defense. And so off they go 
to the insane asylum. The class is now 
reduced to a relative handful who may 
have been in some sense mad when they 
committed their criminal acts, but who are 
at least superficially lucid at the time of 
trial. Of these, only a very few would be 
so foolish as to plead insanity. The reason 
is simple, although seldom appreciated by 
the public. A guilty plea results in a deter-
minate sentence, and with good behavior 
and a proper show of penitence the crim-
inal can count on his freedom in not too 
many years. An insanity acquittal, on the 
other hand, almost always results in com-
mitment to a mental institution, and release 
from a mental institution is at best an 
iffy proposition. The usual statutory 
standard is a finding by the hospital 
physicians. and possibly by a coun, that 
the inmate has recovered his sanity or is 
no longer dangerous, or both. Particularly 
in the case of a man committed after a 
violent crime, both physicians and courts 
are predictably reluctant to make such 
findings. Thus, the defendant "acquitted" 
for instanity actually faces an indefinite 
period of confinement. Hospitals for the 
criminally insane are hardly Sunnybrook 
Farms, moreover, and society treats those 
who are released with an ad version usually 
reserved for lepers and returned turncoats. 

The net effect of all this is that no de-
fendant in or out of his right mind raises 
the insanity defense unless the conse-
quence of a normal conviction would be 
execution or a very long sentence indeed. 

Since the defense is of such slight im-
portance in determining the disposition of 
the pitiful hordes who stream through the 
criminal process, why all the excitement 
about the insanity defense? Why indeed? 
True, the defense when raised in a sensa-
tional case does enliven the trial. And the 
conceptual issue is well calculated to call 
forth the best and worst from psychiatrists, 
philosophers and lawyers. But why not 
worry instead about the problem in full 
outline: how should society identify and 
deal with the criminal who somehow is 
not like the rest of us? At best the insanity 
defense plays a small role in the total 
drama, and good reasons can be and have 
been suggested why it should be forgotten 
altogether. 

The issues cast up by proposals to 
abolish the insanity defense are far too 
complex to be argued in a book review. 
And it is ultimately unfair to challenge an 
author for writing the book he did and not 
some other. But it can fairly be asked why 
Professor Goldstein, well aware of the 
limitations of the insanity defense, still 
feels that its fulfills a needed function in 
the law. The alternative would be, in 
broadest outline, to remove the thorny 
issue of mental abnormality from the trial. 
where determination of the defendant's 
sanity becomes bogged down by the 
elaborate procedural ritual of the adver-
sarial process, and instead to evaluate the 
defendant's mental condition in a more 
informal post-trial proceeding to decide his 
disposition. 

Professor Goldstein has, essentially, two 
reasons for retaining the insanity defense 
in something like its present form. The 
first revolves around the role he envisages 
for the jury; the second, around the value 
he attaches to the adversarial process. Tbe 
need for a jury determination of

1bis analysis of the function of the in-
saoity defense and the role of the jury has 
.ewnJ soft spots. The first question is 
wbether the jury realizes that it is being 
liked to make a moral judgment. After 
;e 
Jiltening to a parade of psychiatrists and 
Uy 
beiaB instructed by the judge to determine 
ts. 
wbether the defendant is suffering from a 
"mental disease or defect," the jury may 
pardonably conclude that the question as-
siped it is more medical than moral. 

Moreover, even if the jury realizes that 
it must make a moral judgment, bow 
does it balance this against the other judg-
ments it must make? An acquittal for 
insanity does not merely mean that the 
jury has absolved the defendant from 
"bbame." As pointed out earlier, it also 
means that the defendant will go to a 
mental institution instead of to prison. He 
may or may not receive any help or treat-
ts, 
ment there; he may or may not find it easy 
toFt out. The jury's verdict sets all those 
wheels in motion. Yet in most trials the 
py is not even told that the defendant 
acquitted for insanity will be committed 
y 
IDCl not immediately released; nowhere is 
it told what will happen to him once in 
e 
lbe hospital. Certainly, as long as we are 
0 
~ 
10 band the jury this great undigested lump 
ol decision-making responsibility, we 
should hand them th,j: fullest possible in-
formation not only about the defendant 
but also about what the consequences of 
n 
their verdict will be. To paraphrase 
:Jt 
Justice Cardozo, "Moral judgments in the 
air, as it were, will not do." 

Furthermore, should we ask the jury to 
deliver a single elliptic verdict which must 
respond to such divergent questions as 
whether the criminal law should formally 
"condemn" the offender, use him as an 
1.1. 
eumple to others, rehabilitate him, or 
simply restrain him to protect society? 

We might tell the jury clearly that its 
oaly task is to determine the facts and to 
clecide whether "blame" is in order, and 
tbat the judge or some later agency will 
!lis 
decide the issues of restraint, rehabilitation 
IDd the deterrence of others. If, on the 
o 
Giber hand, we wish the jurors to consider 
such questions, should we not perhaps al-
low the jury to address itself separately to 
s 
"Do you find this man evil and blame-
¬∑r' 
WWthy?" and "Do you think this man is so 
dipaerous that he must be confined to 
protect the community?" and "Do we have 
( lhe ri&ht or the duty to 'treat' this man and 
condition him to accept and conform to 
our norms?" 

In either case, shouldn't we at least tell 
~jury, one way or the other, which issues 
lllbould consider, and which will be 
r 
raolved elsewhere-to the extent, of 
COUrse, that these questions can ever be 
leparated and considered one at a time? 

Professor Goldstein does not address 
tbae issues. He seems, implicitly, to as-
lllme that the "moral judgment"' he finds 
DeC:essary can be and is isolated when 
a JUrY decides to acquit for insanity. 

ll'erhaps, on the other hand, be feels that 
"dae hard-to-state purposes of the su~ 
~ve law" must be lumped together 
~the single question: Guilty or Insane? 

'Nbic:hever the reason, a more rounded 
Qpiaoation for his faith in the jury to 
-.ban unstructured and largely unin-
llra&:ted response to the insanity defense 
.._..be welcome. 

Professor Goldstein's second principal 
.__for accepting the insanity defense 
~llllbething like its present form lies in 
-Yalue he attaches to the adversarial 
...-... Like the role of the jury, this also 
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢familiar issue in the law. The value of 
vigorous advocacy by both sides in decid-
ing such crucial questions as guilt or 
innocence is clear. Professor Goldstein 
contributes a valuable chapter to the 
problem of providing an effective defense 
for the indigent accused who is mentally 
ill. Indeed, much of his book is well cal-
culated to instruct the lawyer in deciding 
how and when to raise the insanity de-
fense; if read by enough lawyers, The 
Insanity Defense will do much to enhance 
the sophistication and effectiveness of 
innumerable future trials. 

The costs of the adversarial process are 
also clear, however,to Professor Goldstein 
as well as others. An issue continually 
bruited about is whether a battle of expert 
witnesses at the trial should be permitted to 
confuse the jury. The psychiatrist for the 
defense testifies to the insanity of the ac-
cused. His counterpart hired by the prose-
cution, in equally impressive jargon says, 
"Not so." How much better, say some, to 
have a single impartial expert appointed by 
the court. Professor Goldstein rejects this 
proposal perhaps too emphatically. He 
points out that many such court-appointed 
experts are poorly qualified. This is a valid 
criticism, but it goes to the way things are 
done, not the way they might be. Professor 
Goldstein also argues that much of the 
"battle of experts" is real, and not simply 
the result of professionals playing hired 
gun: responsible psychiatrists do often 
differ on the proper diagnosis of an ac-
cused, and-more senselessly--on 
whether his condition should be labeled 
a "mental disease." Professor Goldstein 
thinks the danger that the jury will be 
confused or overawed by such disagree-
ment is overrated. He feels strongly that 
"the factual issues and normative prob-
lems calling most for decision by a jury" 
should be fully aired before them. 

This insistence on a full adversarial 
proceeding is integral to Professor Gold-
stein's belief in the need for an insanity 
defense. It is a respectable, time-honored 
and forcefully argued position. But in 
sending everything to the jury through an 
adversarial proceeding, Professor Gold-
stein may focus too much on the best 
choice among presently available alter-
natives and too little on the best possible 
solution. He may truly believe that the 
jury is the best body in every way and for 
all time to decide every question. But his 
faith .in, or at any rate reliance upon the 
jury may also reflect a distrust for psy-
chiatrists, the effectiveness with which 
courts can review their decisons, and, 
most important, the willingness of society 
to provide enough good psychiatrists. 

Perhaps, with time, some or all of these 
parameters may change. If so, Professor 
Goldstein will then undoubtedly re-
examine his conclusions. Unfortunately, 
his book devotes too much attention to 
patching up the status quo and too little 
to considering the need for and p<Xsibility 
of an approach qualitatively different 
from the present regime. ‚Ä¢
