These movements shared similar 
rhetorical postures, borrowing freely 
from each other, from the rhetoric of 
Marxism as well as from the emerging 
rhetoric of feminism, the third major 
progressive movement of the era. 

Their major point of divergence was 
that once the war ended, so did the 
essential moral and political problem 
which had so agitated white college 
students, while racism existed

years were definitely not the future 
envisioned at May Day. 
When 
Douglas Miranda, a group leader of 
the New Haven Chapter of the Black 
Panther Pa~ty, addressed a crowd of 
Yale students with "There's no reason 
why the bulldog and the panther can't 
get together," there was both a plea 
and a plan in his words. The plea was 
for Yale to support the pressure the 
Party and its supporters were bringing 
to bear upon the State of Connecticut 
to free the prisoners. The plan was that 
this enterprise was one step along a 
journey, the pathway of which was to 
be shared by both black and white 
radicals. 

The problem with this plan is that 
the campus Miranda stood before was 
one caught in the grip of two distinct 
progressive movements. On one hand 
stood Miranda, the rest of the Black 
Panther Party, the Black Student 
Alliance at Yale and a large cross-
section of New Haven's African-
American population. Their move-
ment was an 
historically specific 
moment in the the ongoing struggle for 
African-Americans' rights and safety 
!he struggle against white supremacy 
In America, the long term thread of 
which connects Malcolm X to So-
journer Truth. Their partners in this 
great enterprise were Yale's antiwar 
nearly 500 years. 

Also there was the inherent contra-
diction presented by an antiwar 
posture that called for some measure of 
pacifism, not to mention that many 
antiwar activists were simply 
frightened. The first lesson which the 
Black Panther Party taught was that it 
was a human right to defend oneself 
against violence, with violence, to the 
point of killing one's antagonist. Given 
such different cardinal principles, it is 
clear that the relationship between 
white student radicals and Mrican-
Americans was in 
many ways 
contrived. 

To suggest- nearly 
20 years 
later- that this union of diverse 
interests and peoples was actually a 
union of convenience or even a mere 
flirtation is not meant as an attack 
upon the ideals and commitment of 
those whites who supported the Party. 
It is an analysis of what Mrican-
American students consider to be the 
obvious: white students on American 
college campuses, including Yale's, are 
apathetic if not outright antagonistic to 
the interests and agendas of their 
African-American classmates. If 
anyone wants proof of this they need 
only 
examine 
the 
well-publicized 
instances of racist violence and 
harassment at 
University of 
Massaschusets at Amherst, at 
Columbia University, at the Uni-
versity of Michigan at Ann Arbor, and 
so on throughout the Reagan Era, on 
down the list to Mother Yale. 

As if these dynamics did not pose 
enough problems for African-Ameri-
can student progressivism, there is the 
already mentioned concern that what 
passes for student activism in the 
contemporary context is a far cry from 
what it once was. The changes in the 
class position of incoming students is a 
piece of the explanation. Another 
major piece is the increasing social and 
political distance between African-
American students at Yale and their 
counterparts in the New Haven 
community. 

Once upon a time, when the Black 
Panther Party or any New Haven 
resident spoke of police violence, black 
Yalies knew what they were talking 
about. One of the first things to 
happen in the fall of 1969 was a party 
thrown by the recently opened Afro-
American Cultural Center. 
No 
descriptive record of the party itself 
exists today, but one can easily 
imagine: Think bell bottoms and Sly 
and the Family Stone, exchange fade 
cuts for Afros and you get the picture. 
The party was advertised in New 
Haven by means both official and 
informal, and much like a House party 
today it attracted a fair number of New 
Haven's college-age youth. One can't 
be sure if this was the first time this had 
ever happened but what happened 
next is a familiar occurence in New 
Haven's African-American commu-
nities: The New Haven police arrived 
in force and started arresting any black 
men they could fmd. 

This was not unusual on the border 
between Yale and New Haven. The 
unusual aspect of this particular night 
was that the hosts of the 111en being 
shoved into police vans, the BSA Y, 
protested the treatment of their guests 
as any good host would. The police 
went about their business, ignoring the 
BSA Y's arguments that no one at the 
center had calJed them, that there was 
a party going on, that people would 
come to parties. A rock was thrown, 
and a police riot eruptc:d. A large 
group of about 70- a few students and 
many more New Haven residents-
- ran away from the center en masse, 
throwing objects at their uniformed 
pursuers. By morning there had been 
50 arrests, 
including the BSA Y's 
moderator. 

What makes this incident note-
worthy is that in 1990 it simply 
wouldn't happen. New Haven resi-
dents still come to parties at the 
Cultural Center (it's cheaper than a 
club) but not only do Yalies usually 
steer clear of the locals, but Yale 
regulations stipulate that a Yale police 
officer must be present. The theory is 
that the University's private security 
force is needed to protect Yale property 
and Yale students. The practice is that 
when a Yale police officer catches a 
student doing something relatively 
stupid -while not felonious-the worst 
that could happen is that he or she is 
taken home and reported to a resi-
dential college dean. New Haven 
residents are handed over to New 
Haven police, usually to the relief of 
their Yale counterparts. 

Our historical ties 
must be 
acknowledged, 
excavated and 
nurtured. 
The current situation is the result of 
real class differences within the 
African-American community, but it 
is also a symptom of the African-
American students' willingness to let 
their class 
position 
under white 
supremacy dictate their relationship to 
their own community. Although few 
grew up in New Haven and fewer 
remain after they graduate, 
our 
connection to the local community for 
the four years that we are here is vitally 
important. It is a relationship based 
not only upon the empirical reality of 
common race, interest and culture, but 
also upon a host of historical ties, such 
as May Day. Such ties must be ac-
knowledged, excavated and nurtured. 
Without them all of our struggles here 
in the University, whatever they may 
be, become isolated, parochial andjust 
that much harder.
