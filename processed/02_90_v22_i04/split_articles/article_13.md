**Closing Up Shop**
**Author: Arthur Bradford**
**Page number(s): 14-15**

May Day cost Rosey's Cleaners on Wall Street a lot of money. "It cost me $350 dollars just to board the place up," said Herbert Rosenberg, or Rosey, as he is known throughout Yale and New Haven. Like dozens of other shopkeepers who own stores downtown, Rosey closed his business and fortified his showcase windows with layers of plywood. Although no one came into the shop for two days, Rosey said the place was swamped beforehand with students rushing in to pick up their clothing before heading home to avoid what they thought would be a full-scale riot. "They were all scared to hell."

Rosey and his sister Georgiana both remember seeing protesters walking by their shop on their way to the Green, some with clubs and bats in their hands, one even brandishing a fencing foil. In his 62 years in the business, the tailor can remember no event like May Day. "We were closed for three days then, and we never close, except for deaths in the family," he said. 

"Business came to a halt," said David Battista, who used to run the shoe store on Temple Street that still bears his name. "We were told not to open because the situation was pretty critical. No one knew what to expect." 

Since his store was literally only a stone's throw from the Green, Battista was particularly worried about his windows. Nonetheless, he did not board up his shop; instead he called his insurance agent. "I knew that we were involved in a very serious situation in which many stores could get destroyed or looted," he said. Battista was relieved to hear that his store was covered under a civil-disorder clause. 

Not all storeowners in the area saw May Day as a danger. Rafael Dilauro, the owner and manager of Group W Bench, said he thought of those days as just "a regular weekend." (Dilauro sports a beard at least a foot long and describes himself as "very liberal.") At the time he ran what he calls "a head shop" on Edgewood Avenue. His store, which has since moved to Chapel Street, sells, among other things, colored beads, psychedelic jewelry, exotic musical instruments and carved wooden pipes. Dilauro stayed open and kept normal hours during the protests. Unlike most shopkeepers in the area, he thought that May Day had positive effects on the community. "I kind of liked it. It put some national focus on New Haven." He said the government's reaction of calling in the National Guard was unnecessary. "It was total overkill. The whole thing was over before it started." 

One thing Rosey the tailor remembers about the period was the change in fashion among students. "They started to wear a lot of khakis and blue jeans," he noted. "You know I think that all started with the Beatles, I really do." 

There is perhaps no better judge of Yale fashion than Paul Press, owner of J. Press on York Street, whose upscale shop sells clothing ranging from the classic navy blue blazer to the multi-colored scarves associated with each of Yale's residential colleges. Press said that business during those first days of May was particularly slow, but added that in those days students weren't flocking to J. Press anyway. "The undergraduates were reluctant to buy our clothes because of the lifestyle then. They were wearing awful-looking things and everybody would be ashamed to come in and buy a suit. If they did, they kept it quiet." Although he hired two "well-armed guards" to protect his store, windows were broken and a few small items were stolen from the displays. 

"This was something you would never have expected to happen at Yale because of the background of the boys that were here and their educational and cultural training before they were at Yale," said Press, who is skeptical of the motivations behind the protests. "It was just a good opportunity to raise hell and so forth." 

Dilauro looks back on the events of May Day with nostalgia. He claims that the years since then have lacked the spirit and unpredictability of those times, but he expects that the '90s will bring in a new age of activity. 

"Something is happening. I'm not exactly sure what it is," he said, smiling. 

Rosey, on the other hand, would probably not agree. From his vantage point behind the counter of his cleaning business, he continues to watch Yale and New Haven carefully, and remains confused by May Day. 

"Those people out there on the Green," he said, "they were all fighting and shouting out against the establishment. They're all in the establishment now."

Art students politely stenciled their slogans around the posters left by other protesters.
