**Title: Suspicion and Paranoia The Secrets of the May Day Security Machine**

A 30-year-old man with glasses and 
light thinning hair stepped out of the 
city heat into the air-conditioned lobby 
of the Park Plaza Hotel. He ap-
proached the desk, asked the attendant 
for a room, and checked in under a 
false name. None of the employees 
noticed, but someone else did. 

Unbeknownst to this man, every move 
he made was monitored by a hidden 
video camera located behind the 
counter. The camera relayed the scene 
to a screen several blocks away, at the 
New Haven Police Station. There, an 
officer zeroed in on the man's face, and 
then on the guest book, and called over 
his boss, Chief of Police James F. 
Ahern. The two quickly determined 
the 
stranger's true 
identity, 
and 
suspected that he registered under a 
false name. 

"He called me up one day and said 
there's a guy named John Dean that 
just checked in," said Sam Chauncey, 
operational head of University acti-
vities during the Panther trial protests. 
John Dean was at that time the 
38 The New Journal/February 2, 1990 
assistant to Attorney General John 
Mitchell, and would soon move into 
the White House as counsel for 
President Richard Nixon. Opinions 
vary on what exactly Dean was doing 
in New Haven in the weeks leading up 
to 
Black Panther 
trial 
demonstrations. In his book, Blind 
Ambition, Dean briefly states that while 
he was in jail after the Watergate 
scandal, he met a guard he had spoken 
with several years earlier while on 
assignment near Yale. "He and I had 
shot the bull one afternoon back in 
1970 when I was covering a pro-Bobby 
Seale demonstration for the Justice 
Department," Dean wrote. 

"That's just a lie," said Chauncey. 
"He was not the official representative 
from the Justice Department. We were 
already working with someone else 
who was appointed for that task." Dean 
never contacted the police or the Yale 
administration the entire time he was 
in New Haven. This made men like 
Yale President Kingman Brewster and 
Chauncey wary, for it was common 
knowledge that Nixon hated Brewster 
and his liberal university admini-
stration. 

Chauncey and Brewster filed a claim 
under the Freedom of Information Act 
to look at the Justice Department 
documents on them. "Just about every 
one of them was whited out for reasons 
of national security-why our acti-
vities were considered a matter of 
national security I'll never know- but 
it was clear that M itchell had given 
Dean some instructions," Chauncey 
said. 

Two events took place while Dean 
was in New Haven. One was the bomb 
that blew up in Ingalls Rink at the end of 
a rock concert given by a group from the 
Divinity School. The second was the 
burning of the "Peace Building," which 
was the radicals' headquarters on the 
corner of Elm and Church Streets. The 
police declared that the fire was 
deliberately set, but no one was ever 
arrested or prosecuted for the crime. 

Both acts were evidently the work of 
professionals, for while the campus

police found many other pipe bombs, 
Molotov Cocktails and homemade 
devices around New Haven, only the 
one at Ingalls Rink worked well 
enough to actually explode. And since 
both acts targeted campus radicals, 
some suspected th~ destruction was the Â· 
work of provocateurs, designed to raise 
tensions and incite a riot. 

"I think that's classic anti-police 
paranoia," said J. Daniel Sagarin, 
assistant U.S. attorney at the time. 
There is no telling whether federal 
officials were involved in either of the 
two incidents. But in New Haven, as 
in the rest of the country, police, 
leftists and University administrators 
had good reason to distrust each other. 

"There was an immense amount of 
anger, and the belief was common 
among radicals in those days that 
nothing 
short of violence would 
represent progress," said Bill 
Chickering (BK '70), a leader of the 
unarmed marshals who worked con-
stantly to keep the peace without the 
use of force. 

In the weeks preceding the protests, 
Chauncey stayed in continuous contact 
with James Ahern and his brother 
Chief Inspector Steven Ahern, and 
was kept well informed on potential 
threats to the peace. The Ahern 
brothers earned national recognition 
for their ability to keep control of the 
situation. Communication and infor-
mation, rather than the use of force, 
were the elements that James Ahern 
emphasized. "It was a well-planned 
wheel, run very smoothly, and I was 
just one of the spokes," said former 
Yale University Police Chief Louis 
Cappiello. 

Seven years passed before the public 
learned about the inner workings of the 
Ahern brothers' security machine. The 
May Day demonstrations marked the 
peak of an illegal wiretapping oper-
ation which involved the New Haven 
Police, the Southern New England 
Telephone Company, and members of 
the FBI who targeted "gamblers and 
left-wing militants" as 
subversive 
individuals. Included among the 
names of those tapped were nine 
attorneys, three Yale College masters, 
several other Yale teachers and 
clergymen, and assorted students, 
Panthers, and radicals living in New 
Haven. 

Eventually, 
1,251 people 
successfully filed suit and collected 
damages from the City of New Haven, 
SNET and the Ahern brothers. 

It began as early as 1958, when 
Richard Sulman, an electrical engi-
neering major at Yale, took out an 
advertisement selling electronic 
listening devices. Steve Ahern visited 
Sulman's apartment several days later. 
"He seemed very interested in the 
technology of eavesdropping," Sulman 
told a Police Board hearing in 1977. 
Sulman, a wiretap expert, testified that 
he sold Ahern two devices at their first 
meeting, and several more over the 
next few years. The court never deter-
"Jim Ahern's primary 
concern was to keep 
New Haven from 
turning into a 
bloodbath." 
mined when the New Haven Police 
began using illegal wiretaps to monitor 
conversations, but the high point of the 
operations-in 1969-1970, when New 
Haven became a center for antiwar 
activity- coincided with the tenures of 
the Aherns. 

The police ran their wiretap 
operation from a room on the fourth 
floor of the Powell Building on Church 
Street, and later expanded to a larger 
building on Court Street during the 
Aherns' tenure. The closets and rooms 
were fuled with various machines like 
the "pen registers" which recorded any 
phone numbers dialed, and other ma-
chines plugged into the switchboard by 
an employee at SNET. "There was a 
person within the phone company who 
did supply this service. Of course, for 
payment," Deputy Inspector Vincent 
DeRosa, who participated in the 
wiretaps, 
said at a 
police board 
hearing. 

In the course of the hearings, it 
emerged that former Mayor Biagio 
DiLieto, then chief of police, told 
Sergeant Francis DeGrand to dump 
three wiretap machines into the 
harbor. 
Instead, DeGrand bashed 
them with a hammer in his basement, 
and left them there incapacitated. The 
battered machines were introduced in 
1977 as prime evidence of the oper-
ations. 

Sergeant Walter P. O'Conner, an 
intelligence officer until the summer of 
1969, testified that in 1969 or 1970 the 
telephone wiretaps were expanded 
from gambling and organized crime 
figures to radical political groups. His 
partner, Sergeant Pasquale Carrieri, 
added that several FBI agents became 
involved in the operation after it 
moved to the Powell Building. These 
agents were identified as Raymond 
Connally, William Glossa and Theo-
dore Gunderson. 

Carrieri declines to discuss the case 
t~ay. "I've thought about it a great 
deal. It was a painful time for all of us, 
and I would not like to talk about it," 
he said. "You're asking the wrong guy, 
pal," said former Sergeant Robert 
Lillis, in response to questions about 
the wiretap disclosures. Coming in the 
wake of Watergate, the city probe that 
investigated the police wiretaps in 1977 
provoked popular outrage. But in 
1970, many citizens were grateful to 
the police for maintaining order during 
a frightening time, and few asked 
questions about their methods. "In 
those days, the practice of wiretapping 
was honored by a wink," said Sagarin, 
who represented the Ahern brothers. 

"You know, people don't remember 
that violence was prevented as a direct 
result of the wiretaps," Sagarin said. 
"[The wiretaps] had been used to pre-
vent at least one bombing. They forget 
that there was a murder which was 
unresolved. And they forget that some 
of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit were the 
families of convicted bank robbers." 

Chauncey agrees with Sagarin's analy-
sis that "Jim Ahern's primary concern
