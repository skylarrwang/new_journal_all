Although most of them seemed to adapt to their temporary surroundings, some brought traces of their parents' radicalism. "I remember seeing a somewhat angelic child write 'kill the pigs' all over the poster she was painting," recalled Pearl. 

After May Day, children went home and students continued to rally for permanent day care at Yale. Within the month, the administration promised to match any funds Pearl and Schmoke's group could raise. Donations totalling $17,500 came in from various sources, including the Yale Symphony Orchestra and the secret society Book and Snake. Over the summer, the rector of St. Thomas More House on Park Street offered the use of the church's recreation room, and in September, 1971, Calvin Hill officially opened its doors. The day-care center remains the only demand from the May Day strike ever tangibly realized. 

Even in that first year, Calvin Hill did not attract as many children from union families as its founders had expected. Only eight of the original 20 children had parents who belonged to Yale's unions. "It was a thing before its time," Chauncey said. "Many blue-collar workers were suspicious of day care. Many of them wondered what was going to happen to their children." 

Today more working-class parents want day care, but they cannot be sure Calvin Hill will have spaces for them. Although it remains the only Yale center which provides care based on need alone, Pearl, now assistant director of the Bronx Zoo and a mother of two young children, remains skeptical about the center she helped create. 

"What was meant to be something geared toward union workers," she said, "has come to belong to the middle class."
