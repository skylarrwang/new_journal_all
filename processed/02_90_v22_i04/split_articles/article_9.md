Around midnight, glass shattered as three 
bombs exploded in a stairwell at Ingalls Rink. 
and bottles in hand, moved on the 
police; the cops responded by firing 
tear gas canisters. As the gas drifted 
onto Old Campus, people fled, leaving 
the quadrangle deserted except for the 
poet Allen Ginsberg, who sat cross-
legged on the bandstand chanting 
~om, Om." A few students came back 
to hold wet towels to Ginsberg's eyes as 
tears rolled down his face, and the oms 
went on. 

Around midnight, glass shattered as 
three bombs exploded in a stairwell at 
Ingalls 
Rink. 
The blast shook 
buildings several blocks away. 
Although thousands crowded into the 
rink for a rock concert, the rumor of 
Panther arrests had all but emptied the 
building. 
No one was 
se~t~ously 
injured, but the damage cost nearly 
$1 00,000 to repair. 

Saturday was much like Friday, with 
calm speeches during the day and 
fighting between protesters and police 
at night. 
Because of diminishing 
attendance-only 7000 were on hand 
for the second rally- the afternoon 
passed quietly and organizers decided 
to cancel the activities scheduled for 
Sunday. Just after dark, however, a 
fire broke out at the rally headquarters 
on the corner of Church and Elm 
Streets, where the New Haven Savings 
Bank now stands. Spectators gathered, 
first on the' courthouse steps, then 
more of them on the Green. Once 
again, demonstrators threw rocks and 
bottles; again, police and National 
Guardsmen responded with tear gas. 
The gas spread into colleges and 
seeped into dorm rooms, and students 
had to take refuge in the attics. Still, by 
the end of the weekend, the police had 
made just 37 arrests, including only 
one Yale student, and no one had been 
seriously hurt. 

The National Guard began rolling 
out of New Haven on Monday-the 
same day troops in Ohio killed four 
students on the Kent State campus. 
"What happened at Kent State was 
what my father was scared to death 
would happen here," Porter said. The 
relative peace in New Haven led Life 
magazine to conclude, "Yale proves 
:lissent doesn't have to turn out that 
way." 

The national media praised Yale's 
handling of the protests, and the 
Corporation unanimously backed 
Brewster's actions during the strike. 
Some students began preparing for 
finals, while others continued to skip 
class as part of a national strike against 
the Cambodian invasion. Officially, 
normal academic activities resumed, 
with special 
grading procedures 
provided for work missed during the 
strike. 

"I'm not sure what the May Day 
protests did really accomplish," Coffin 
said. "It certainly did not free Bobby 
Seale." But while the protesters did not 
stop the trial from going forward, Seale 
was eventually freed. On May 26, 
1971, Mulvey dismissed all charges 
against Seale as well as fellow Panther 
Ericka Huggins after the trial ended 
with a hung jury. Mulvey figured that 
a second trial would only generate 
more controversy and result in a 
similar deadlock. 

Twenty years after May Day, the 
issues ·raised by the spring protests still 
reverberate on campus. If Seale's trial 
made Yale students think about racism 
in the judicial system, debates today 
over divestment, hiring practices and 
curricula indicate similar concerns 
about Yale itself. While in 1970 
conservatives attacked Kingman 
Brewster for having violated Yale's 
neutrality by supporting the strike, 
President Benno Schmidt now draws 
cntJCJsm for not being outspoken 
enough. In 1970. the Strike Steering 
Committee called upon Yale to take 
responsibility for the welfare of the 
New Haven community by providing 
housing and day care; today, admini-
strators discuss investment in the city 
and students volunteer in a range of 
community projects begun then. 

By raising these issues, May Day pro-
foundly affected Yale and the students 
of 20 years ago, and helped shape the 
generation that followed.
