**Title: Adventures in Doonland**
**Author: Ruth Conniff**
**Page number(s): 20-21**

Charlie "the Doon" Pillsbury (DC '72) 
sits behind a big oak table in the Fair 
Haven Masonic Temple. Occult sym-
bols and ornate marble carvings 
decorate the room. As he nibbles his 
lunch, the Doon talks softly about the 
"uncanny" quality of Garry Trudeau's 
cartoons .. "Garry was original. Some-
times so original he was describing 
things that hadn't happened yet, or 
that he didn't know had happened," he 
says, shifting in his chair. "That was 
his intuitive genius." Peering through a 
pair of round glasses, Pillsbury looks 
like the main character in Trudeau's 
Doonesbury strip. "It's true that they 
called me 'the Doon' in college," he 
explains. He acquired his nickname 
when he and Trudeau (DC '70) were in 
prep school 
together. 

"It was a 
boarding school term for people who 
do outlandish things," he says, "people 
who aren't afraid to make fools of 
themselves." 

The character Mike Doonesbury, 
whose name 
is 
an amalgam of 
"Pillsbury" and "the Doon," came into 
the world as an awkward, skinny 
freshman in the comic strip Bull Tales, 
which Trudeau drew for the Yale Daily 
News as an undergraduate. While 
B.D., 
the 
campus 
football 
hero, 

performed 
feats of exaggerated 
prowess on an imaginary field, his 
roommate Doonesbury lurked in the 
shadows at mixers, fumbling his way 
through a series of ill-fated attempts to 
pick up girls. Around 1969, the char-
acters Megaphone Mark and Zonker, 
also based on real people at Yale, 
"Garry was original. 
Sometimes so original 
he was describing 
things that hadn't 
happened yet." 
entered the picture. As radicals and 
freaks took over leading roles in the 
cartoon strip and at school, Mike 
Doonesbury developed into a figure of 
rationality and calm at the center of 
Trudeau's loony world. 

Doonesbury became nationally syndi-
cated right around the time Trudeau 
and his friends left college. The 
cartoonist continued to 
make up 
adventures 
for 
the characters he 
invented at Yale. Meanwhile, Charlie 
Pillsbury spent two years doing civil 
service work 
as 
a 
conscientious 
objector to the Vietnam War, before 
returning to New Haven to attend 
both Yale Law School and the Divinity 
School. Today he runs an or-ganization 
called Community Mediation out of 
his peculiar temple/office, helping to 
settle disputes among landlords, 
tenants and neighbors in Fair Haven. 

Doonesbury never imitated incidents 
from real life, Pillsbury says. None-
theless, 
there are some striking 
parallels. For instance, there is the case 
of the Reverend Scott Sloane-"the 
fighting young priest who can talk to 
the young"-a parody of both Yale's 
Reverend William Sloane Coffin and 
Trudeau's friend Scott McClennan, a 
Davenport senior. McClennan now 
serves as chaplain at Tufts University. 
"His life has taken almost the same 
path as the role in the strip," Pillsbury 
says. "That's why the strip has that sort 
of uncanny, intuitive side." 

Between 1968 and 1970, Trudeau 
documented the arrival of coeducation 
on campus, the draft lottery, the Black 
PantherÂ·trial, and Kingman Brewster's 
battles with stodgy alumni and self-
righteous student protesters. "It was 
quite a surprise to those of us who 
thought he couldn't draw," says Mark 
Zanger (SM '70), the former leader of 
Yale's chapter of Students for a 
Democratic Society, and the inspi-
ration behind the character Mega-
phone Mark. "Originally it was all 
about football. So you had this sort of 
crudely drawn huddle, and then words 
came out of it. Now all of a sudden he 
was drawing, like, three quarters of a 
body, and people with hair. These 
were things we hadn't seen before." 

Trudeau refined his satirical style in 
his junior and senior years, poking fun 
at everyone from dumb jocks to SDS. 
While B.D. -modeled after Brian 
Dowling (BK '69)- and Zanger never 
actually met each other, Trudeau 
brought them together as players in the 
same off-beat drama. "His recollection 
of me is probably the same as mine of 
him, which is only through the comic 
strip," Dowling says of Zanger, who 
was in the class below him in school. 

Dowling remembers relatively little 
about the upheaval on campus in the 
late '60s. I wasn't really politically 
active," he says. "Basically, my 
extracurricular involvement was in 
athletics." In Dowling's senior year the 
biggest event of the season was Yale's 
29-29 tie with Harvard. Up until that 
day the star quarterback, much like his 
caricature, had won every game since 
the seventh grade. 

A recent issue of Sports Illustrated 
dubbed Dowling "the last All-
American"- an old-style football hero, 
who played in the twilight of an era 
when men were men, the game was 
The Game, and girls went to Vassar. 
Today, Dowling owns a closed-circuit 
televison company called Ivy 
Communications, which broadcasts 
small 
college 
contests 
to 
alumni. True to cartoon form, most of 
what he remembers about his under-
graduate years revolves around sports. 
"I think not only Yale but a lot of 
schools 
were 
lot different 20 
years ago," he says. "If you had one 
football game on T.V. on a weekend 
that was a lot. Now you have five or 
six." 


Zanger, on the other hand, vividly 
remembers the tiny guerrilla war he 
waged between 1968 and 1970 against 
the Establishment in general and Yale 
President Kingman Brewster in parti-
cular. Like Megaphone Mark, Zanger 
found himself continually thwarted by 
Brewster. "He would never do the 
stupid thing that would put everybody 
on our side. He wouldn't call the cops 
to smash our heads. He wouldn't let us 
into the building . . . I mean, I spent a 
lot of time trying to fathom this guy in 
order to be able to embarass and defeat 
him. And I really did come to admire 
his cleverness in that scenario." 

Sitting in his house in Boston, where 
he has worked as a journalist and a 
union organizer for the last 20 years, 
Zanger recalls the Movement and his 
obsession for taking over admini-
strative offices. "Building take-overs 
were it. They were the 195 7 Chevy of 
1970. You had to have one .. " 

In 1969 Bull Tales ran a series on
