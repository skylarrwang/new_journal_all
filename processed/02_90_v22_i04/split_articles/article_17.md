He came up with the tune, he says, 
while working at a construction job 
one summer . (Later, the Trudeau car-
toon depicted Megaphone Mark ·at-
tempting to enlighten the proletariat 
on a similar job, only to be beaten up 
by hardhats). 

As Zanger became increasingly radi-
cal, he found that he had less and less 
in common with his hippie peers. Mid-
way through his junior year, he cut his 
hair and stopped taking drugs. He 
started spending most of his time 
organizing groups like the Student 
Worker Alliance, 
and described 
himself as a committed Stalinist. 
"Basically, the political trip became 
much more hard core." 

By the time May Day rolled around, 
the whole campus had become in-

volved in a general student strike, and 
extremists like Zanger were squeezed 
out. "I kept proposing that we do 
building take-overs," he remembers. 
"But.! was constantly out-voted." 

Freshmen and sophomores who 
were interested in a looser counter-
cultural agenda broke away from the 
militant SDSers. "You can see the split 
in some of the propaganda of the 
time," he says. "In Garry Trudeau's 
cartoon, the character Megaphone 
Mark originally had a foot in both 
worlds. Then, right around that time, 
I think he introduced the ·character of 
Zonker Harris." 

Zonker's origin and identity are 
more mysterious than the former SDS 
chief lets on. While Zanger implies 
that the mellow freak is a spin-off of

Megaphone Mark, many Yalies have 
c.ontended otherwise. 
One of 
Trudeau's close friends associates 
Zonker with a crazy guy in Davenport 
College. "My impression-and Garry 
never discussed these things, you sort 
of drew your own conclusions- was 
that he was a guy in D-port named 
Richard Khalidi," says Timothy 
Bannon (SY '70), who co-edited the 
Yale R ecord humor magazine with 
Trudeau. "But no one really knows." 

Members of the society Saint Anthony 
Hall swear that their own David Wilk 
(CC '72) is tpe one and only Zonker. 
For sheer physical resemblance, 
Wilk makes a very convincing candi-
date. 

The 39-year-old poet, who 
retreated to the woods of Vermont for 
several years after graduation, still has

long hair and lines around his eyes that 
look like parentheses. "I was interested 
in rock-n-roll and drugs and the 
cultural changes going on all over the 
country," Wilk says of his under-
graduate days. "For me, that was more 
important than SDS." Wilk was the 
literary program director of the 
National Endowment for the Arts until 
Reagan took office, when he decided 
he no longer fit in. For the last eight 
years he has owned a small New 
H aven company which distributes 
feminist books. 

"I think there were a few great places 
to be in the late '60s, and Yale was one 
of them. It knocks me out that I was 
here," says Wilk, a sophomore during 
May Day. "I got in right when they 
changed the admissions policies away 
from the Big-Man-on-Campus theory, 
and started letting in more unusual 
people. It was a miracle." 

Wilk describes Yale in 1970 with a 
soft, rhythmic intonation, sprinkling 
his sentences with the word s "I 
remember." "There was so much going 
on. I remember I was writing poetry 
and involved in a magazine. And there 
was a coffee house in the basement of 
the church next door to Calhoun, 
where, I remember, I used to go every 
weekend to hear music and poetry. 
There was an underground newspaper 
called The View from the Bottom, where I 
learned to do lay-out and design. And 
I remember there was an organic food 
store on Whalley, where we started a 
food co-op." 

Among the things Wilk remembers 
best about May Day are the huge vats 
of brown rice that bubbled all weekend
