Kurt Schmoke 
Reform ~ not Revolution 
Jamie Slaughter 
Kurt L. Schmoke (DC '71 ), mayor of 
Baltimore and trustee of the Yale Cor-
poration, laughs about it in retrospect. 
Sitting in a red leather chair in his City 
Hall office, Schmoke recalls the day he 
burst into a closed faculty meeting in 
Sprague Hall, bullhorn in hand. No 
student before him had ever inter-
rupted an official convocation of the 
Yale College faculty . 

Two thousand students had 
gathered outside, waiting to hear if the 
faculty was going to endorse the stu-
dent strike. Inside, more than 400 pro-
fessors packed the room. All was quiet 
as Schmoke strode up to the podium. 
He spoke only a few sentences: "There 
are a great number of students who are 
confused and many who are fright-
ened. They don't know what to think. 
You are our teachers. You are the peo-
ple we respect. We look to you for 
guidance and moral leadership. On 
behalf of my fellow students, I beg you 
to give it to us." 

Schmoke's mildness surprised the 
teachers, who were accustomed to the 
angry rhetoric of radical students and 
Black Panthers. "I wanted to say to the 
faculty, many of whom felt confused 
and besieged themselves, that most of 
the students still wanted some leader-
ship," Schmoke recalls. His audience 
responded with a standing ovation. A 
few minutes later, they voted to sup-
port the strike. Schmoke's speech 
helped to unify the campus and avoid 
the type of generational rift that crip-
pled other colleges at the time. 

As a varsity football and lacrosse 
player, an activist in Dwight Hall and 
a member of several administrative 
committees, Schmoke was a natural 
choice to represent the student body 
before the faculty. "There was no big 
man on campus, but I had just been 
elected secretary of. the class, so at least 
a few hundred people in my class knew 
who I was," he says. 

Schmoke went on to study at Oxford 
on a Rhodes Scholarship, and earned a 
law degree from Harvard in 1976. In 
1977, President Jimmy Carter ap-

pointed him assistant director of the 
White House Domestic Policy Staff, 
and in 1987 he was elected mayor of 
Baltimore. Last year he joined the Yale 
Corporation. 

The distance he has traveled from 
student activist to Corporation mem-
ber sometimes surprises even 
Schmoke. "I think about it from time 
to time and I smile. There is a certain 
irony to it." For the most part, 
however, Schmoke has led a consistent 
career; he has always, for one thing, 
played the role of conciliator. 

When striking students marched up 
Hillhouse Avenue to the President's 
house with a list of five demands, 
Schmoke persuaded them to post the 
list on a tree instead of nailing it to 
Kingman Brewster's front door. "I was 
fairly moderate politically," Schmoke 
says, "and so I was not a big supporter 
of some of the more radical factions. 
But I also wanted to see changes. I 
guess I wanted to see reform, not 
revolution." 

Schmoke served on the monitoring 
committee, a student-faculty body that 
acted as a liaison among the police, the 
Black Panther Party and University of-
ficials. "As a part of the committee I 
went everywhere," he says. "I met with 
people in little back alleys and dark 
rooms as well as some of the big brass 
of the University in the Corporation 
room." 

In 1988, Schmoke made headlines as 
the first prominent public official to 
suggest that the United States consider 
legalizing drugs. As President Bush 
pours more and more money into his 
anti-drug war, a few voices including
