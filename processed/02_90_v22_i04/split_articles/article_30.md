EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Yale did change in several very impor-
tant ways, but I wish it had held on to 
some of the very important com-
mittments it made at the time. 
TNJ: How do you mean? 
Hersey: I think that promises were 
made, or understood anyhow, in 1970 
that have not really been fulfilled. Yale 
has worked out a comfortable peace 
with the establishment of the city, in 
terms of accomodating its buildings-
developing stores underneath its new 
constructions and so forth. But the 
whole issue of Yale's relationship to 
blacks in New Haven, to minorities in 
general and to the poor has not been 
faced. It has not been faced by society 
at large. I think that we've just 
postponed these issues, issues that are 
going to have to be dealt with at some 
time in the future. 


TNJ: So are you disappointed in the 
political climate on campus now? 
Hersey: Well, there's no point in being 
disappointed. The best you can do is 
hope that some of what's happening in 
the world will restore a sense of public 
service among students. 


TNJ: What about the question of the 
role of the University-what do you 
think of the argument that it was · a 
travesty that Yale cancelled exams and 
suspended academic work for the 
Bobby Seale trial, that the academic 
environment was politicized and com-
promised? 
Hersey: That, I think, is a rational 
conservative argument. But if you take 
as a much more extreme example of 
what was happening then what hap-
pened in Beijing last spring and sum-
mer, and what's happened in Eastern 
Europe recently, you see that univer-
sity students were out front on the need 
for change. And they had to suspend 
the real meaning of their lives in 
education for what seemed more im-
portant. I don't mean to argue that 
May Day had that kind of dimension 
to it, but reducing the scale, that's the 
issue. There were questions that had to 
be dealt with, and for a short time 
anyhow, it was appropriate that Yale 
suspend its main function. 


TNJ: It seems like there was a very 
strange mix of attitudes at the time. To 
some degree, here were these privi-
leged children enjoying themselves in 
all the excitement, and at the same 
time these were very serious issues they 
were confronting. D id you think that a 
46 The New Journal/February 2, 1990 
lot of the students were not that 
serious? 
Hersey: I would say probably a ma-
jority of students were not engaged, 
and a great many left on May Day and 
had disdain for what was going on. 
The issue of whether these were kids 
playing games of politics- that's a little 
bit cynical, because if you take the 
position that people with education 
and who are engaged in serious profes-
sions and teach should refrain from 
playing games of politics, what do you 
have? 


TNJ: Maybe it's unfair to pick on your 
book in hindsight, but what you wrote 
about students' contempt for careerism 
seems ironic now-"If American bus-
iness could persuade young people ... 
that careers in business would enable 
them to relate and to help, then they 
would flock into business. Until that 
day, they will flock into every available 
avenue of social service, politics, 
reform and revolution." What has hap-
pened to that shining generation? 
Hersey: Well, I think a surprising 
·number of the students who . were 
radicals turned around. But they didn't 
become yuppies. They went into law 
and medicine, and are practicing as 
very serious and positive contributing 
citizens. They have managed to bring 
about some important social changes 
quietly, in a piecemeal fashion. 


TNJ: What about when you were a 
student here? People talk a lot about 
the shift away from the Old Yale in the 
1960s. Do you think things have come 
full circle? 
Hersey: 
Well, · no. Things have 
changed a great deal. When I was a 
student it was at the end of the Depres-
sion, and I was a scholarship student. 
Then you had to figure out how you 
were going to earn three meals a day 
when you graduated. After I grad-
uated I lived on a dollar a day for food 
for a couple of years. It was not an easy 
time. It was the time of Roosevelt, and 
so there was a tremendous sense of the 
kind of social responsibility that I've 
been mourning the want of, at this 
moment, in the air. 


TNJ: Was there the same sense that 
students had a special role, that they 
were the bearers of idealism or radi-
calism then? 
Hersey: There was not much radi-
calism at Yale, I must say. Yale was a 
very conservative place. We had maids 
who cleaned up our rooms. We had 
printed menus in the dining rooms 
with choices for dinner, served to us by 
waitresses. It was a privileged world, 
no question. Most of us were going on 
to take responsible 
positions 
in 
business and government. But as I said 
there was also a sense of social respon-
sibility. I think that students went out 
and lived up to the challenges of the 
time, in small and indirect ways 
through the lives that they led. 


TNJ: So in that sense, at least, the 
Yale student's role has not changed. 
Hersey: Yes, although the state of 
mind of greed is so deep-seated now 
that any politician who even murmurs 
that he may have to raise taxes is im· 
mediately defeated. Roosevelt would 
have said to us that we owed our 
country some kind of retribution that 
would justify raising taxes. And that 
seems to be the thing that you would 
hope students would see today, and 
begin to do something about in small 
ways: 


TNJ: You mean by going into social 
service work? 
Her·sey: Yes, and even through the 
professions- through teaching and law 
and medicine and business itself. 
Business has been the most irresponsi· 
bl(! in terms of ruthlessness and greed. 
There is lots of room for change in the 
climate of the business community. 


TNJ: If you were going to write 
another letter to the alumni now, 
would you bring up different issues? 
Hersey: Well, as I said earlier, I think 
that our society has postponed dealing 
with the issues of poverty and race. 
And I would still express the wish that 
our students could be thinking seri· 
ously about those problems and how to 
deal with them in our society. 

And then, I think that the way 
change comes in our country is in 
terms of an accumulation of effort, not 
always dramatic or violent, on the part 
of a large number of people. So I think 
that there has to be a change in the 
state of mind. And here's where the 
University could help, in giving stu· 
dents a sense of history, for example. I 
think most students, certainly in the 
time when I was at Yale, graduated 
without knowing much about history. 
We've got to have more of a sense of 
where we've come from and where we 
might go.
