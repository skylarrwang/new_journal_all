was to keep New Haven from turning 
into a bloodbath." 

The disclosures of the entire wiretap 
operation not only cost the City of New 
Haven and the police department great 
sums of money (the phone company 
paid $150,000 in damages, the Ahern 
brothers $35,000, and the City of New 
Haven $1.85 million), it also hurt the 
esteem and reputation of the same 
forces which had been praised so 
highly several years before. When the 
police board asked Inspector Nicolas 
Pastore why he and others involved 
had not reported the wiretapping, he 
replied, "Keep in mind I was working 
for a person !Steve Ahern) who had a 
supercop image . . . probably com-
mended 100 times or more. His 
brother was a nationally acclaimed 
police chief. Who was I? I did what I 
thought was best for me. I ran." 

The irony is that while the indi-
viduals involved knew they were acting 
against the law, they did not know they 
could have done the same thing legally. 
By simply requesting a warrant from a 
federal judge, they could have run the 
entire operation with immunity. "It 
wasn't a case of law and order running 
amuck," said Sagarin, "but simply of 
well-intentioned cops uneducated in 
the letter of the law." According to the 
former assistant U.S. attorney, far 
more wiretaps are employed today 
than during the Nixon Presidency. 
"You've got telephones legally tapped 
for up to 300 days at a time. Not one 
warrant for a wiretap has been refused 
by a judge in the past decade," Sagarin 
said. 

To their credit, the Ahern brothers 
succeeded where almost every other 
city police force failed. There were no 
lives lost, no serious injuries, and the 
damage to Yale and New Haven 
buildings was minimal. But there are 
still those who question the price paid 
for such success. Did New Haven 
unknowingly exchange open violent

confrontation for a Big Brother state? 

In addition to the covert audio-
visual devices used 
to monitor 
subversive activity, the New Haven 
Police used questionable methods in 
apprehending their suspects. "Ahern 
was able to get through FBI sources 
descriptions and photographs of these 
people and he did in fact- I'm not sure 
if it's legal or illegal- arrest them all as 
they came into town," said Chauncey. 
"Every time he saw one, checking into 
a hotel or whatnot, he would pick 'em 
up and put 'em in jail and 't'en days 
later they'd be let out and it was all 
over." 

Sam Chauncey, Kingman Brewster's 
special assistant during May Day, had 
the all-important job of making sure 
Yale survived. Providing security, 
monitoring radical activity, devising 
strategy for protecting the Univer-
sity-all this fell under Chauncey's 
purview. To ensure that events would 
not get out of control, Chauncey said, 
all sorts of preparations preceded May 
Day, many of them top secret. 

Chauncey and New Haven Police 
Chief James Ahem were particularly 
concerned about agitators coming in 
from out of town for the sole purpose of 
tearing down Yale. -These were people 
who were not part of any i~ 
group like the Panthers," he said. 
"'These were people who in those days 
just roamed from town to town causing 
trouble." 

Particularly worrisome was a radical 
splinter group of Students for a Demo-
cratic Society called Weatherman. 
Weatherman had broken from the 
national student organization to 
pursue an agenda of terrorism and 
violence. In late April, Chauncey and 
Brewster drove out to an empty field in 
Western Massachusetts to meet with 
Archibald Cox, then an administrator 
at Harvard and Jater special pi'OICC\l&Or 
in the Watergate hearings. Cox. who 
Although Sagarin does not believe 
that the federal authorities were behind 
the Ingalls Rink bombing, he said that 
Jim Ahern was worried that the federal 
government wanted the New Haven 
demonstrations to get out of hand. 
Ahern made sure to keep the National 
Guard out of the center of town. "He 
was very concerned about the possi-
bility that federal troops would 
intentionally precipitate violence like 
that at Kent State," said Sagarin. 

In the weeks preceding the May Day 
demonstrations in 1970, the assistant 
to Attorney General John Mitchell was 
sent with mysterious orders to monitor

bridge weeks earlier, gave Chauncey 
plaotographa and infonnation about the 
group, including the news that they 
wore chartering two buses from Boston 
to New Haven for the rally. 

First, Chauncey and Ahem went to 
Greyhound and took out an insurance 
policy on the two buses. "Then," said 
Chauncey, when Friday arrived, •we :

concerned.• 


leftist radicals. This man was in turn 
illegally monitored by the local police. 
The local police were acting under the 
covert supervision of members from 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
The head of the FBI was taking orders 
from his boss, who also hap pened to be 
the attorney general. And the attorney 
general's boss, Richard N ixon, hated 
Kingman Brewster. 

Paranoia struck deep. 

But it was a paranoia that had no 
loyalties to the left or to the right. 
Those who wanted to keep order were 
j ust as worried as those who wanted to 
overthrow order. Even the brave 
armband-wearing student marshals, 
who stepped between the National 
Guard's wall of fixed bayonets and the 
thousands of rock-throwing demon-
strators, were not sure if they could 
trust one another. "There was the 
belief that demonstrations in and of 
themselves were useless, the normal 
political process was useless. W ith all 
the rage at the time was the belief that 
the only way to bring about the Red 
Revolution was the radicalization of all 
these sweet liberal arts students," said 
Chickering. "There was a theory at the 
time that you wanted the cops to break 
heads. T hrough police intervention 
you would radicalize new soldiers for 
the revolutionary movement. I didn't 
agree with that." 

C ops did not break heads, and the 
revolution never got underway in New 
Haven. But today the far-reaching 
impact of legalized wiretaps still helps 
protect 
us against criminals who 
threaten society. Although we no 
longer live in an era of upheaval and 
confron tation, it is possible that we 
would feel more comfortable if we did .
