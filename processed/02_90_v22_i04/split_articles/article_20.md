Black Panthers stirred up support among Yale students. 
28 The New Journal/February 2, 1990 
Walking back to his dorm room one 
night in the spring of 1970, William 
Farley (SM '72) worried he might get 
kicked out of school. He had just 
volunteered to represent the Black 
Student Alliance at Yale on the Strike 
Steering Committee, of which he was 
soon elected chairman. "I realized that 
I was in the process of making a 
decision whether I was going to throw 
away my whole Yale education. If 
things went badly, I would be one of 
those held to blame," he said. Many 
students, African Americans espe-
cially, feared consequences to their 
academic 
careers 
if they 
were 
perceived as too radical. "Being black 
wasn't going to help you if all hell 
broke loose," said Elwyn Lee (SY '71 ), 
an active member of the BSA Y. 
Although they couldn't guarantee 
anything, _the African-American 
faculty members saw it as their job to 
protect black undergraduates from 
academic disaster. "We had to make 
sure that the students were capable of 
going on and serving the struggle after 
their Yale days were over, and the only 
way we could assure that was to make 
sure that their academic careers 
remained intact," said Ray Nunn (BR 
'69), who worked for the dean's office 
in 1970. 

Today professors are more con-
cerned about restoring students' 
memories. Houston Baker Jr., Yale 
instructor of English in 1970, worries 
that black undergraduates have for-
gotten the activism of that era, that the 
memory of an event like May Day is 
fading fast. "I don't find on the part of 
many black students to whom I talk a 
clue about the '60s, that it existed, that 
it should be a legacy to them," said 
Baker, current director of the Black 
Studies Center at the University of 
Pennsylvania. "They are missing a 
great deal if they don't have some 
involvement with that world of Afro-
centric ideas, events and concerns." 
Back in 1970, though, students at 
Yale were thrust into that world, 
primarily because of the black faculty. 
"We viewed ourselves as being in the 
same situation as 
blacks in the 
commu~ity because of a historical

community because of a historical 
legacy," said Roy Bryce-Laporte, the 
first 
director of Yale's African-
American Studies program. The 
events of the spring intensified these 
ties. "Blacks saw a special commitment 
to taking a stand because Bobby Seale 
was black," said Sheila Jackson, (BK 
'72) a leader in the BSAY. In addition 
to demanding a fair trial for the Pan-
thers, the African-American scholars 
pushed the University to pay more 
attention to blacks on the faculty, in 
the student body, in the curriculum, 
and in New H aven. 

"We saw ourselves as academic 
activists," said Baker. "We were inter-
ested in changing the character of 
scholarship so that it would empower 
the lives of black people in urban 
communities in America." A look 
around New Haven 20 years later 
shows that some of the May Day 
demands could bear repeating today. 
The predominantly black Dixwell and 
Hill neighborhoods that surround the 
campus are stagnating in poverty, and 
Yale still hasn't stopped expanding imo 
the city. 

When R alph Dawson (PC '71 }, 
former 
moderator of the BSAY, 
returned to the University a few years 
back, he found padlocks chained to 
many of the campus gates he had 
fought to open two decades ago. Back 
then, 
activists wan ted improved 
community relations so that the 
University wouldn't have to shut the 
neighborhood ou t. "There was a belief 
that change was possible in terms of 
making the University realize that one 
of the reasons you've got to put locks 
on gates is because of how you relate to 
the community," said Farley. 

At the 
same time, 
inside 
the 
University, Bryce-Laporte, who now 
teaches African-A't'"lerican Studies at 
Colgate U niversitt, introduced new 
academic goals. "Within the midst of 
this political situation, it seemed an 
opportune time to demand some 
leriousness toward the importance of 
Afro-American Studies as an academic 
discipline," he said. "Many of the 
developments in Afro-American 
Studies had their roots in the demands 
that were being made during that

time." 

Yet the program that Bryce-Laporte 
worked so hard to build up is now 
slipping at Yale. With the past year's 
resignations of J ohn Blassingame and 
Edmund Gordon as chairmen of the 
program, African-American Studies at 
Yale has not overcome the conditions 
Bryce-Laporte and his colleagues tried 
to alleviate. Since it is still not a 
department in its own right, African-
American Studies does not have the 
power to grant tenure or appoint 
professors. Hirings in other disciplines 
do not always meet the needs of the 
program, and when Blassingame left, 
he criticized the University's weak 
commitment to affirmative action. 

The black faculty leveled similar 
criticisms 
in 
1970. 
To Baker, 
Brewster's 
celebrated 
liberal 
administration d id not seem progres-
sive at all. "I don't really feel that the 
administration, moving from Brewster 
on down, had any long-range plans 
with respect to dramatic increases in 
black faculty or black students," said 
Baker. Over the past 20 years, total 
numbers of blacks on the faculty have 
actually decreased by six percent, 
although the number of tenured blacks 
has increased by 41 percent. Student 
ratios have risen by only three percent. 

While battling to increase their 
numbers in the student body, African 
Americans clashed among themselves. 
Farley remembers when a group of 
black freshmen marched up to Presi-
dent Brewster's house to demand a 
minority recruitment program. They 
intercepted by some 
black 
upperclassmen. "What are you guys 
doing? 
You're going to ruin 
everything. This isn't how things are 
done 
here," 
Farley 
recalled 
upperclassmen saying. The freshmen 
responded defiantly. "You guys are 
Uncle Toms and we're going to take 



Yale's black students and the Black 
Panthers also came head to head. 
Some felt that attending college meant 
the b lack students were betraying their 
race. "I think that black faculty and 
students on a campus situated right in 
the middle of a traditionally black 
neighborhood feel the guilt of being 
chosen, while a large percentage of the 
population they represent are sub-
jected to genocidal conditions," said 
Baker. "The Panthers thought they 
could exploit the guilt the blacks felt for 
being there," said Nunn. Fervent 
screaming matches erupted belween 
the Panthers and the leaders of the 
BSAY over what kinds of demands 
they could . reasonably make of the 
University. "We were constantly 
taking a lot of heat and verbal abuse 
from the Black Panther party and had 
to translate that into palatable 
demands for the University," said 
Farley. 

At meetings where students argued 
with the Panthers over strike docu-
ments, Bryce-Laporte and Kenneth 
Mills, assistant professor of philos-
ophy, often sat in the back of the room. 
The two men formed the pillars of 
Yale's black community. "Mills was the 
spiritual leader of the student 
demonstrations," Farley recalled. The 
dynamic, 
intellectual Marxist ap-
peared at every major event that 
spring, riveting audiences with his 
electric speeches. "If there was a key 
player on the African-American black 
front , it was certainly Ken Mills," said 
Baker. Though chiefly described as a 
revolutionary dedicated to political 
reform, Mills was not without his 
inconsistencies. "His stated positions 
were ones of radicalism," said Nunn. 
"But the man did drive his girlfriend's 
Ferrari around New Haven." Mills 
died in 1983 of Chron's disease. 

Although not always as visible as 
Mills, Baker came out as a vehement 
spokesman against the Osborne 
Committee, set up to study May Day 
under the chairmanship of black 
professor Ernest Osborne. African-
American faculty saw the committee as 
a blatant example of tokenism, and 
Baker wrote an angry letter to the Yale 
Daily News saying so. The committee 
was dissolved soon after the letter 
appeared. 

"These committees are endlessly 
formed," said Baker. 
Even now, 
committees seem to be the favored 
bureaucratic gambit among University 
presidents. Last year Benno Schmidt 
established the Rodin Committee to 
study minority hiring. In a 1989 
report, the group exhorted the 
University to establish target numbers 
for people of color on the faculty. 
Schmidt finally responded to the report 
in JanuarY., agreeing to strengthen 
minority recruiting at Yale. 

In the spirit of excitement and 
defiance of 1970, the black faculty met 
almost daily, furiously collaborating 
on a .resolution to present at the 
general faculty meeting of April 23. 
Baker and two colleagues hurriedly 
pounded out a draft on a typewriter 
one afternoon. They kept the reso-
lution secret, purposely not circulating 
any copies of it at the general faculty 
meeting. "It was not the intention to 
ask for the input of the whole faculty," 
said Nunn. "We wanted to minimize 
having it diluted." 

On April 23, the African-American 
faculty sat together in Sprague Hall. 
Even when 
augmented 
by 
administrators, graduate students, and 
community leaders, they could barely 
fill the front row. In their resolution, 
they called for the suspension of all 
academic functions of the University 
and a moratorium on all Yale plans for 
land expansion. "These were out-
rageous resolutions, by all standards of 
the University," Baker said. Bryce-
Laporte revealed the document, 
asserting that the black faculty would 
accept no modifications. At one point 
during the meeting, Mills threatened 
that if the faculty did not yield to the 
blacks' demands, they would walk out. 
Finally,· the faculty 
settled for a
