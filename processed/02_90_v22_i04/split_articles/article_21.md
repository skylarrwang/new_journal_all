As throngs of chanting protesters packed the New Haven Green, Edward Thomas Veal (BK '69) founder and first chairman of the Tory Party, sought refuge at a friend's beach house. 
"We took along a fair quantity of food and beer, and sat around and waited calmly for the end of the world." Not all campus conservatives thought that May Day heralded the. crumbling of civilization, but some, like Veal, sensed that the Yale they had known, the Yale of genteel debate and green cups at Mory's, had given way. It is impossible to say what percentage of the Yale population opposed the changes that swept the University that spring, for if these people shared any one trait, it was a lack of outspokenness.

Throughout the late '60s, before anyone at Yale had heard of the New Haven Nine, conservatives were overwhelmed by the liberalism dominant on campus. Much of the time they seemed to wage a campaign just to keep people from taking things too seriously. As new committees broke out all over the University, one right-wing group's constitution prohibited it from convening a meeting. "There was a good deal of humor that pervaded all of these organizations, particularly the POR," said Edward Young (GRD'71), who chaired the party in the fall of 1970. "We used to have debates that would go on until four in the morning on topics such as, 'Resolved, that God does and should exist.'"

John Taft (CC '72), who wrote the book May Day at Yale, and now works as a historian, writer and film maker in Washington, D.C., believes that the conservatives' small numbers and earlier setbacks such as the abolition of R.O.T.C. created "a fundamental discouragement that was not related to the May Day events."

If campus conservatives despaired, they could turn to the Yale Daily News for moral and rhetorical support. Editorial Page Editor Douglas Hallett OE '71) set the paper's tone early on with a number of columns opposing the University shut-down. On)y after the shootings at Kent State did the more liberal editors succeed in overridingÂ· Hallett and endorsing the national student strike.

"The faculty were sheep. They were sheep for the entire period."

"There was a feeling that I had swung the paper too far to the right, and they didn't want that to be the permanent national image of the Yale Daily News," said Hallett, who practices law in Los Angeles. Radical students marched on the News building to protest Hallett's writings, and Black Panther Doug Miranda vilified him before a crowd in Woolsey Hall, exhorting the audience to "silence the pigs." Hallett was not deterred. "There was a feeling of exhilaration at the opportunity to have first principles tested as they were during that period."

Despite his writings, Hallett held other Yale conservatives in contempt. "They assumed a sort of pose of wanting to be persecuted. They were very affected, they adopted upper-class English mannensms. They really weren't players on the scene at all, except as objects of ridicule or avoidance," he said.

But in the opinion of the man who chaired the POR during May Day, Yale's overbearing liberalism forced conservative students into a corner, where some say they remain to this day. "Campus opinion isolated people who were right of center. It drove them to those extremes," said Charles Tharp (BK '72), now treasurer of Oberlin College. Tharp eventuaJiy quit the party when he saw it becoming "too narrow or even fascist in tone." Taft agrees that only the most entrenched right-wingers could hold their ground.
"To be socially and politically conservative in those days, you had to be extreme, very set in your ways."

While conservative students long felt pressure from their liberal peers, they had never seen anything like that spring. "Until May Day it was not as serious and not as threatening," said Young, now an attorney at a Boston law firm. The Yale Student Senate meeting of April 20 in which the group voted to support the strike, demonstrated that campus radicals could generate what one observer called "an atmosphere of terror."

Before the meeting began, people who had no connection to the University filled the back rows of the hall to heckle and jeer at the senators. The combination of the visitors' shouting and the vitriolic speeches delivered by radical speakers intimidated even strike supporters. The following year, a student told an interviewer, "I talked to some of the members, and they admitted that they voted out of terror."
