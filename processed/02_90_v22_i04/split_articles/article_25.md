Schmoke, William F. Buckley, Jr. and 
former Secretary of State George 
Shultz are calling for decriminaliza-
tion. "My second or third year as 
state's attorney I must have been pros-
ecuting about 12,000 drug cases a year 
and things weren't getting better. So I 
started reading about Prohibition and 
saw some rough analogies to what was 
going on now," he says. "We are being 
about as successful in achieving a 
drug-free America as we were in 
achieving an alcohol-free America dur-
ing the '20s." 

Schmoke's reasoning on the drug 
issue is consistent with another feature 
of his career: his concern with issues 
that directly affect the community 
around him. As a public official, he 
stresses his efforts to involve all 
elements of society in fighting urban 
"If you're concerned 
about social issues 
don't look beyond 
your own backyard." 
problems. "The job of the mayor is to 
care about people in the community," 
he says. 

H e argues that the government 
should handle drug addicts as people to 
be treated rather than as a monolithic 
threat to society. "My view is better 
described as medicalization rather than 
legalization," Schmoke says. If drugs 
were made legal, government could 
regulate their use, and keep them out 
of the hands of children. Users could 
also have the assurance of sterile 
needles. 

"The connection between 
AIDS and drug abuse made me think 
you've got to approach this thing as a 
public health issue," he says. 

Legalizing drugs, Schmoke says, 
would also eradicate much of the crime 
that 
is 
destroying urban neigh-
borhoods. "The thing that really got 
rne thinking about legalization," he 
says, "is that a friend of mine, a police 
officer, was shot in a drug deal that 
went bad. H e had a body wire on, so I 
had to listen to him die, and then make 
a decision on whether to prosecute the 
guy who killed him for the death penal-
ty. That was a very emotional, very 
difficult time for me, and I started 
thinking about the problem in a dif-
ferent way." 

Other programs the mayor of Balti-
more has devised include a joint effort 
with business leaders to guarantee a 
job or college financial aid to any high 
school graduate with a 95 percent at-
tendance record. He has also targeted 
adult illiteracy. One of Schmoke's pet 
projects has been the development of a 
new day-care facility, which opened 
last October. To raise the $665,000 
to finance the center, Schmoke 
has 
tried to foster cooperation between the 
public and private sectors. 

Schmoke actually began his work 
with day care when he was at Yale. It 
was his idea to include employee child 
care among the five demands of the 
May Day Strike Steering Commitee. 
Throughout 1969, Schmoke and Mary 
Pearl (DC '72) had struggled to 
establish a day-care center, and they 
saw May Day as an appropriate time 
to revive the issue. "What Mary Pearl 
and some other students and I tried to 
say was that if you're all upset and con-
cerned about social issues, don't look 
beyond your own backyard. There are 
things happening right here on Yale 
campus that should have your atten-
tion. That's why we were so insistent 
about the day-care issue." Schmoke 
and Pearl were able to get Davenport 
College designated as a child-care area 
over the May Day weekend and even-
tually helped establish the Calvin Hill 
Day Care Center. 

As a new member of the Corpora-
tion, Schmoke will have the chance 
once again to address issues that affect 
the community in and around Yale. 
Meanwhile, his backyard continues to 
grow.
