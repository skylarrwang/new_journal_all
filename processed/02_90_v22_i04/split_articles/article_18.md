on Old Campus. This, for him, 
marked an important cultural change. 
"It really had a major effect on the 
dining halls. May Day introduced 
them to brown rice and vegetables, 
and after that you could get vegetarian 
food," he says. 

Zanger, who in recent years has 
become a restaurant critic, has a very 
different recollection of that particular 
change. "They made us all eat granola 
for three days ... It was hideous. One 
of my major political gestures of the 
weekend was to take some New York 
radicals of my acquaintance out to 
locate a source of pastrami, so we could 
get some cholesterol." 

Today, both Zanger and Wilk find 
the split in Yale's youth movement sad. 
"It's a pity," said Zanger. "I mean, yet 
another of the fragmentations of that 
era. Had they stayed together, poli-
ticos like me would have been looser 
and more open to 
psychological 
change, and the hippies would have 
been more rooted and less silly." Wilk 
feels sorry for people who were too 
serious to experience the cultural 
awakening of the late '60s. "Losing 
yourself is a good thing. A lot of people 
didn't, and they missed out. They 
didn't go to Woodstock or Chicago. 
You can only do these things once." He 
worries that students now are so 
hindered by college loan debts that 
they don't have the same opportunity 
to travel and explore that he did. 

Despite the striking resemblance, 
Wilk denies his friends' claims that he 
is Zonker. "They think I am, but I 
think it was Mark Zanger. I never 
even knew Trudeau." But then, 
Zanger and B.D. barely knew Tru-
deau either. Both remember him as a 
quiet guy who slipped in and out of the 
Daily News office. As is his habit, the 
cartoonist himself politely declines to 
be interviewed. 

Timothy Bannon probably knew 
Trudeau best. While the rest of the 
campus was in a turmoil at the end of 
"Building take-overs 
were it. They were 
the 1957 Chevy of 
1970. You had to have 
one." 
the '60s, Bannon and Trudeau were 
having a great time matching wits over 
Dunkin' Donuts at 4 
a.m., and 
typesetting the Record by hand in 
Trudeau's dorm room. Bannon wrote, 
while Trudeau drew, and the two kept 
up a running satire of campus life and 
national politics. "We were early fun-
makers of the Nixon administration," 
Bannon recalls. 

In 1974, when Trudeau became a 
graduate student at the Yale School of 
Art and Bannon entered the law 
school, the two stayed in touch. "Nixon 
left the White House on August 9, 
1974, which was a Saturday. I remem-
ber pretty clearly because I 
got 
married that day," Bannon says. "We 
went to Mory's afterwards and Garry 
brought a television set. We all had 
dinner together and then over dessert 
we watched the President resign." 

Most of Trudeau's classmates scat-
tered after graduation. The class of 
1970 was pretty much broken up by 
the end of the year anyway, after the 
protests and the strike on campus. 
Bannon moved to a beach house in 
Connecticut to finish his senior essay 
and Pillsbury became deeply involved 
in the antiwar movement, travelling to 
other campuses around the country to 
participate in demonstrations. 

Even though they have gone on to 
pursue their separate lives, the people 
Trudeau observed at Yale remain 
connected through the Doonesbury strip. 
The characters they inspired continue 
to act out their political drama on the 
nation's funny pages, still magically, 
hilariously true to life. "A lot of times 
it's really more a case of life imitating 
art," the Doon says. He pauses to stare 
off across the room, and for a moment 
he gives the impression of one of those 
repeat panels in the comic strip, when 
nothing happens for a moment, before 
someone delivers the last line.
