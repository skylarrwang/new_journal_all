tenure? First he backed a group of 
black revolutionaries and now he was 
broadcasting his opposition to the war 
in Vietnam. 
Whatever his moti-
vations, Brewster framed the trip as an 
example of Yale's unity; it showed that 
students, faculty, trustees and alumni 
could work together. 

This was the unity he had worked so 
carefully to preserve throughout the 
spring. During May Day, he said, 
Yale had negotiated a course between 
the attacks of the counterculture and of 
the government. "It did unify the 
institution," he said, "giving the 
institution quite a lot of pride in its 
accomplishment, not falling into the 
hands of either the Hoffmans and the 
Rubins or of the Mitchells and the 
Hoovers, both of whom really had a 
death wish for us." 

A month later in his commencement 
speech, Brewster saluted the gradu-
ating class for its relentlessness in 
pressing for change. "Important was 
your success in bestirring your elders 
to reconsider how Yale should be run," 
he said. He hailed also their wil-
lingness to work within the system and 
to remain ("by Hoffman-Rubin 
standards anyway") civil. The class of 
'70 reciprocated his praise with a 
standing ovation. Winning the stu-
dents' admiration by professing 
admiration for them was another 
typical Brewster move. "Brewster had 
a capacity to make whomever he was 
talking to feel 
that he genuinely 
respected them," Chauncey said. "And 
by doing that, he commanded respect." 

When Kingman Brewster died in 
November, 1988, mourners at his 
memorial service remembered him for 
his willingness to listen to his critics. 
Whether they be radical students or 
reactionary alumni, Brewster tried to 
make his attackers feel as though they 
were being heard- to have them be-
lieve he would respect their point of 
view, even if he disagreed. That was 
what he believed a university was all 
about .
