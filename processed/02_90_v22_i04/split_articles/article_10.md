The official 
line was 
explicit. 
"Remember that the colleges are not 
sanctuaries from 
the 
police," ad-
monished a Davenport memorandum. 
"They are free to enter the college and 
to make arrests for violations of drug, 
liquor, 
and weapons 
regulations. 
Please be observant of these laws." A 
Timothy Dwight notice read, "Should 
violence occur in streets around TD 
the gates will be closed . . . TD will not 
be a fortress or a political refuge but a 
center for aid." Not all students, 
however, adhered to the rules. "We 
had lookouts in the tower. We had peo-
ple patrolling the courtyard. If 
anybody was being chased into Stiles, 
we had plans to close and bar the gates 
on the cop," said Jeff Lewis (ES '70). 

In anticipation of the May Day ral-
ly, Yale students had chosen to 
"liberate" their residential colleges, of-
fering shelter to the visiting 
demonstrators. Berkeley opened half 
of its rooms while T.D. 
restricted 
guests to "public spaces" such as the 
buttery, 
squash courts, 
ping-pong 
room and laundry room. In Stiles, 
Lewis said, "We opened up the entire 
college. Some took people into the 
rooms. 
Most 
camped 
m 
courtyard." 

T he visitors 
who occupied the 
couches and common-room floors 
ranged from Harvard friends to Black 
Panthers. 
One 
respondent 
to 
a 
questionnaire issued after May Day 
described the people he hosted as "col-
lege kids (who J seemed fairl y 
harmless." Another characterized her 
guest as a "nice liberal guy with a gas 
mask." Other Yalies remember their 
guests as radical, militant, or just plain 
bizarre. "T here were all kinds of weird 
people," said Bruce McMurdo (MC 
'71 ). "There were people from Antioch 
gathering in the streets, practicing 
drills they'd learned from European 
student protesters." Master Richard 
Lewis of Calhoun wrote that counter-
culture icons Abbie Hoffman and 
Jerry Rubin showed up at his house 
looking for ~ place to stay. He scrib-
bled on the form: "Hoffman and 
Rubin not invited ... Rubin 'high' all 
the time." The word 
"not" 
was 
underlined twice. 

Four Black Panthers from Harlem 
stayed with Mike Petru (BK '73), but 
they were too interested in the sur-
rounding turmoil to hang around O ld 
"They tended to be 
sort of dogmatic. 
T hey were heroic in a 
kind of m acho sense, 
but you didn't want 
them to open their 
mouths." 
Campus very long. "They were people 
I didn't spend very much time with," 
Petru said. On one of the evenings, 
when tear gas spread through the 
streets, his guests left to check out the 
action and never came back to Welch 
Hall. Bill Crawford (BR '70) spent a 
few uncomfortable moments talking 
with the visiting Panther contingent: 
"They tended to be sort of dogmatic. 
They were heroic in a kind of macho 
sense, but you didn't want them to 
open their mouths." 

Some students were afraid to host 
anyone at all. Ed Samuels (SM '71) 
wrote in an unpublished account of the 
period, "R eflecting my own personal 
concern 
with 
certain valuables 
I 
owned, I didn't sign up to house 
demonstrators in my room." There 
were 
some 
scattered breaches of 
hospitality. Dan Horowitz (MC '71) 
said his student guests stole from his 
room. "T hat kind of took the idealism 
out of the whole thing," he said. One 
Calhoun respondent to the question-
naire claimed that his guests had 
engaged in a different sort of extralegal 
activity: "One guy was a pimp, pimp-
ing off white chicks and giving money 
to the Panthers." Such rumors and 
suspicion thrived in the chaotic at-
mosphere. 

Still, on the whole, Yale students' 
willingness to assist the demonstrators 
superseded any fears of abuses of the 
system. Many said they did not hear 
abou t anything going wrong. "Maybe 
this was just naivete, but I myself 
wasn't in the slightest worried about it. 
It j ust seemed so antithetical to the 
spirit of the time," said Robert Gordon 
(TD '73). 

"T he spirit of the time" probably best 
explains why the students were so 
willing to open up their residences in 
1970 to total strangers. "It was a much 
more experimental crowd back then. 
The times were just so different," 
Bruce McMurdo explained. "Students 
now would be like, 'Well, I paid my 
tuition,' and would see all the people as 
a kind of intrusion." It seems remark-
able today, as college committees work 
to raise our consciousness about securi-
ty and remind us not to prop open en-
tryway doors, but that weekend, vir-
tually the only people Yalies barred the 
gates on were the cops.

**Title: The Children's Crusade**
**Page number(s): 12**

In 
the converted 
firehouse 
on 
Highland Street which houses the 
Calvin Hill Day Care Center, pre-
schoolers play with handmade dress-up 
clothes and miniature kitchen utensils. 
As they put on costumes and cook up 
an imaginary lunch, the children are 
oblivious to the trouble it took to get 
them there. 

To enroll the toddlers in a day-care 
facility, working parents face heavy 
competition. Calvin Hill, now cele-
brating its 20th anniversary, accepted 
only 30 percent of its applicants this 
year, and most other centers in the city 
are just as full. In Ne"-" Haven, the 
day-care crunch makes many .families 
desperate, and at Yale, a growing 
number of faculty members are vying 
for the prized spots in Calvin Hill. 

While the center is renowned for its 
progressive child-care practices, it has 
strayed from some of the original goals 
of its founders. In 1970, students in-
sisted on day care for low-income 
families of Yale's union employees. But 
today, Calvin Hill admits children of 
Yale professors and graduate students, 
and less than half of its children come 
from union families. 

Twenty years ago, day care barely 
existed at all. The University had no 
plans to build up any family services 
until October 1969, when the firing of 
Colia Williams, a waitress in Jonathan 
Edwards Dining Hall, sparked student 
protest against the administration. 
Williams missed a day of work to care 
for one of her children, and her 
dismissal became the focus of a union 
strike organized by Students for a 
Democratic Society. 

Mary Pearl (DC '72), co-founder of 
the Calvin Hill Center and Kurt 
Schmoke (DC '71) urged the Universi-
ty to set up a low-cost day-care facility 
for employees like Williams. The only 
child-care service in New Haven at 
the time was at the Yale Medical 
School. 

Pearl and Schmoke did not realize 
the difficulty of the undertaking they 
12 The New Journal/February 2, 1990 
had proposed. "We were not very 
realistic," said Pearl. The student 
leaders, joined by Sam Chauncey, 
Seymour Lustman, master of Daven-
port College, and I.:.ustman's wife 
Kitty, director of the Medical School 
Child Study Center, formed a group to 
establish a permanent day-care center 
at Yale. 

Schmoke, a football player, wanted 
to name the center after his former 
teammate Calvin Hill (PC '69), who 
then 
attending theological 
seminary and starting for the Dallas 
Cowboys. Although he had no direct 
connection with day care, Hill, a Yale 
celebrity, agreed to give his name to 
the center and became its principal 
fundraiser. 

Convincing administrators that day 
care needed University backing was 
more difficult. 
Not everyone was 
thrilled by the students' proposal. Pearl 
says that even President Kingman 
Brewster, who wrote to foundations on 
behalf of the program, once told her 
Ch d&famiy 
Center 
not to hound him about funding when 
she sat next to him at a speech on 
campus. 

The students, however, loved the 
idea. The Strike Steering Committee 
included an initiative on day care in its 
list of five demands for the University, 
and on May Day weekend, students in 
Davenport College organized an 
emergency day-care unit for the in-
coming protesters. 

Pegnataro's, a local Italian grocery 
store, donated barrels of granola to 
feed the kids. A New Haven pediatri· 
cian spent the weekend in the master's 
house caring for a two-year-old girl 
who arrived with medicine for juvenile 
diabetes. Brewster himself stopped by 
several times with his golden retriever 
over the course of the weekend. 

That first makeshift unit had none of 
the fancy toys or dress-up costumes 
that clutter the Calvin Hill Day Care 
Center today. The children of the 
vtsttmg prO£esters who took over 
DaveRport's common room slept with
