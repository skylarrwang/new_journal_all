**Bobby Seale Still Fighting for Freedom**

He does not sound much like a violent 
revolutionary. Occasionally he slips 
into radical rhetoric, when he is 
condemning Establishment politics. 
But Bobby Seale, former chairman of 
the Black Panther Party, generally 
seems like a liberal, thoughtful man 
committed to peaceful reform. "I never 
believed that I was outside the system," 
he says. "I was part and parcel of it to 
begin with. For me to drop out of the 
system I would have to drop out of the 
universe." 

Now in his early fifties, Seale is 
working toward a doctorate in African-
American Studies at Temple Univer-

sity. "My thesis is tentatively titled 
'Cooperative Humanism,'" he says-a 
theory of coalition politics that offers to 
bring 
together diverse groups of 
oppressed people. Seale says he is 
dedicated to freeing society from 
"corporational, capitalist control of the 
state." 

In recent years, though, the former 
Panther chairman has had some direct 
involvement with capitalism himself. 
Recently, he published a cookbook 
entitled 
Barbecuing 
With 
Bobby, 
marketing his patented recipe for ribs. 
Seale is irked by charges people have 
leveled against him since the book's 
publication that he sold out his ideals. 
"I needed to have some cash flow to 
help me support social change in a 
grassroots way," he says. Royalties 
from his book were to finance a plan to 
renovate dilapidated buildings for the 
homeless in Philadelphia. 

His enthusiasm for the project, he 
claims, led him to overdraw on his 
advance for the cookbook; he was 
recently indicted in O h io for writing 
$7,500 in bad ch ecks. "But f ve cleared 
that up," he says. Meanwhile, the 
renovation program remains in the 
planning phase. "T he idea was to buy 
up these houses-there are 10 to


15 thousand abandoned row houses in 
Philadephia. We would get young 
blacks, Hispanics, and poor whites to 
renovate the houses for poor battered 
women with children." 

As he diSC\,lsses his plans for such 
benign social programs, it is easy to 
forget that in May, 1970, Bobby Seale 
was on trial for first-degree murder. 
Actually, murder was only the most 
serious of the charges that Seale faced. 
The state of Connecticut also accused 
him of kidnapping, conspiracy to 
murder and binding with criminal 
intent- all in connection with the 
murder of Alex Rackley, an alleged 
informer 
about 
the 
Panther 
movement. Seale claims he did not 
know about Rackley's death until one 
night in April, 1969, when he came to 
speak at Yale. After his speech, party 
member Ericka Huggins drove him to 
New Haven's Panther headquarters, 
he says, and left him in the car while 
she went inside. Seale dozed off. He 
woke when a party field marshal came 
to the car to tell him that another 
Panther, George Sams, had beaten 
someone up. "I said, 'What the fuck? 
George Sams isn't in the party. I 
kicked him out of the party eight 
months ago. He goes around beating 
people up, so I kicked his mother-
fucking ass out of the party.'" 

Sams was arrested for Rackley's 
murder and, according to Seale, 
agreed to testify that Seale ordered 
Rackley's death in exchange for a lesser 
sentence. "It was a set-up on the part of 
the federal government and the local 
state's attorney," Seale contends. 
"During the closing argument of the 
trial I went to sleep in the courtroom, it 
was so trumped up." 

In May, 1971 , all charges against 
Seale and Huggins, his co-defendant, 
were dismissed when the jury could not 
reach a verdict. "In effect, I won the 
case," Seale says. According to him, 
the jury actually reached a not-guilty 
verdict in his case, but was stymied 
when considering the charges against 
Huggins. 

Outside the courtroom, protesters 
who sided with Seale added to the 
Pressure of the trial. "Student support 
did not surprise me," Seale says. "I had 
spoken at Yale to 2,000 students. The 
Panthers used to circulate 200,000 
newspapers each week, and 50 percent 
of those were to college students." He 
was most impressed that the May Day 
demonstrations did not center exclu-
sively on the Panthers. "I love the idea 
of students who are multi-issued, not 
single-issued. Women's groups, 
African-American groups- they must 
understand that they are tied in 
together. 
That trial, 
massive 
support- all that solidified my belief in 
human liberation." 

In 1966, Seale and Huey Newton, 
then students at Merritt College in 
Oakland, 
California, 
founded the 
Black Panther Party, championing 
socialism as the only way to combat 
"I am still a political 
revolutionary. 
Revolution means to 
me to revolve the 
power back to the 
people." 
racism and human oppression. They 
also espoused violence when necessary 
for self-defense. "I do not run around 
advocating that every organization 
pick up some guns," Seale says. "As 
long as the power structure doesn't 
attack us, fine. But prior to the 
founding of the Black Panther Party, 
peaceful 
protesters- black, 
white, 
yellow, 
blue, 
purple and 
polka-
dot-were beaten." 

Seale claims responsibility for 
another, often forgotten tenet of the 
Panthers, the "Community Programs 
Concept." The party established 
service organizations such as health 
clinics and voter registration centers in 
several cities, and served free meals to 
inner-city schoolchildren. Seale cites 
the latter program as a model for the 
California school system's free break-
fast plan. "This is the character of the 
Black Panther Party that I tried to 
promote," he says. 

For a few years, such projects 
flourished, but by the mid-'70s the 
party had disintegrated because of rifts 
in its leadership, negative publicity 
and harassment from the FBI. Seale, 
however, remained in the public eye. 
In 1973 he ran for mayor of Oakland, 
hoping to earn 20 percent of the vote. 
Although few saw him as a serious 
political contender, he forced a runoff 
against the Republican incumbent. He 
eventually lost the final election, but in 
the process he won 43,719 votes to the 
incumbent's 77,476-only two years 
after the Rackley trial had closed. 

With the "Inter-Community Syner-
gic Project, Inc.," Seale has turned to 
more populist politics. "If I can show 
two youths how to make a profit 
roofing a house, they don't get into 
selling drugs," he says. 

Seale's emphasis on youth may stem 
from his experiences as a father. When 
he boasts about his children, he seems 
more 
settled 
than 
his 
passionate 
rhetoric suggests. 
He has three 
children, a daughter, 11, and two sons, 
18 and 23. "My oldest son, MLK 
Seale, is trying to do some rap music; 
he's trying to get people to understand 
what the '60s were about. We being 
adults, my wife and I were put off at 
first by rap music, but to hear him put 
positive content into it really blows our 
minds." 

Although African-American politics 
have changed over the years, Seale 
says his own goals are the same. "I am 
still 
a 
political revolutionary. 
Revolution means to me to revolve the 
power back to the people. We said, 'all 
power to all people'- power to the 
prisoners, power to the students. If it's 
women's rights, I stand for those 
rights. When we talk about black 
liberation, 
when 
we 
talk about 
women's liberation, we are talking 
about human liberation."
