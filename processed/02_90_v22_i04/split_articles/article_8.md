"There ain't nothing wrong with taking 
the life of a inotherfucking pig!" Black 
Panther David Hilliard told 5000 Yale 
students packed into Ingalls Rink. The 
crowd booed, but Hilliard continued. 
"Go boo me again, racists .... Go 
back to your humanities classes. Yale 
has a long way to go if they don't think 
we're hostile . . . and angered by the 
inactivity of a bunch of young stupid 
motherfuckers." 

Down the street, Bobby Seale and 
eight other Black Panthers were on 
trial 
for murder. 
The 
Panthers' 
revolution had come to the Yale 
campus. "The Panther program was 
really asking of whites no more than 
our forbears 200 years before had 
asked 
of 
the 
British 
king 
and Parliament," said former Yale 
Chaplain and activist William Sloane 
Coffin, Jr. During the spring of 1970, 
Yale took up Hilliard's call to action. 
Classes stopped as students went on 
strike and rallied in sympathy with the 
Panthers. On the weekend of May 1, 
thousands of demonstrators converged 
on the New Haven Green. "We were 
the center of the universe for a few 
moments," said William Porter III 
(DC '71), now a history teacher in New 
Haven and current secretary of his 
class. "We made national news." 

It all began a year before May Day, 
when police pulled the body of Alex 
Rackley from the Coginchaug River 
25 miles ncrth of New Haven. The 
Black Panther had been shot 
twice, and cigarette burns and ice-pick 
wounds scarred his body. A wire 
hanger encircled his neck. On March 
13, 1970, Seale arrived in New Haven 
to stand trial for ordering the murder 
of Rackley, a suspected police in-
formant. The Panthers claimed that 
the police had trumped up the charges 
as part of a conspiracy to destroy their 
movement and the cry spread, "Free 
Bobby Seale." Hilliard warned, "If 
anything happens to Bobby Seale, 
there will not be any lights for days in 
this country. Not only will we burn 
buildings, we will take lives. We will 
kill judges." The party threatened to 
storm 
the Montville, 
Connecticut 
prison where Seale was incarcerated. 

The Yale community began to rally 
to the Panthers' defense just before the 
trial. During pre-trial proceedings on 
April 14, Judge Harold Mulvey sen-
tenced Hilliard and Panther Emory 
Douglas to six months in prison after 
they argued with a court officer who 
told Hilliard to stop reading a note. 
Although Mulvey released the two 
"We were the center of 
the universe for a few 
moments. We made 
national news." 
men the following week, his over-
reaction lent credence to the Panthers' 
claim that white courts could not treat 
black revolutionaries fairly. "I had 
great sympathy for the Panthers," said 
Coffin, now president of a nuclear 
disarmament group, "if not as champi-
ons of justice then as victims of injus-
tice." The Panther slogan "Power to 
the people" began to echo throughout 
the campus. 

"The issue of racism in this trial 
brought something to our conscious-
ness," said Porter. "We began to think 
that maybe this wasn't the land of the 
free, and people weren't innocent until 
proven guilty." More than 400 Yale 
students attended a meeting on April 
15 w discuss how to show their con-
cern. Suggestions included bombing 
Yale, shutting off New Raven's water 
supply, and, as one law student 
proposed, the public shooting of one 
volunteer each day until Seale was 
freed. Their actual response was much 
more moderate. They called on the 
Yale Corporation to donate $500,000 
to the Panthers' defense and declared a 
four-day 
moratorium on classes. 

Meanwhile, Panther supporters 
announced a rally to be held on May 1 
on the New Haven Green. They 
predicted 50,000 people would come. 
Yale President Kingman Brewster 
feared that protesters arriving in New 
Haven for the rally would vent their 
wrath on the University, a symbol of 
the white establishment. Over the 
objections of some masters and faculty, 
Brewster decided to open up the 
campus to the out-of-town demon-
strators in the hope of defusing their 
anger. The residential colleges would 
provide food and housing. 

As administrators braced for the 
onslaught, students and faculty began 
to talk of striking. Many students felt 
they were wasting their time in class 
while events of national importance 
unfolded around them. "I came to see 
the need for some taking of time, some 
suspension of business as usual," said 
French Professor Peter Brooks. Yet 
some questioned what a strike would 
accomplish. "Were we going to stop the 
trial?" Porter wondered. "Was he going 
to get a fairer trial because we were 
doing this?" 

After the rally at Ingalls Rink on 
April 21, students returned to their 
colleges to decide whether to strike. 
Calhoun and Silliman voted strongly 
in favor of. the idea, while Saybrook 
came out against it. A group called the 
Strike Steering Committee pressed for 
the dismissal of charges against the 
"New Haven Nine" and, in addition, 
demanded that Yale provide unem-
ployment compensation and day-care 
facilities 
for its 
employees, fund

community 
housing projects, 
and 
cease buying up New Haven property. 
Students began 
picketing 
Linsly-
Chittenden and Harkness Halls with 
signs reading, "Skip class, 
talk 
politics." Some heeded only the first 
part of this exhortation. Porter said, "I 
didn't think of not goipg to class in a 
political sense. I thought of it more as 
'Hey, I don't have to go to class 
today."' 

But if some undergraduates spent 
their April days playing frisbee and 
suntanning, others took the strike 
seriously. 
Silliman 
coordinated 
a 
"teach-out" in which more than 500 
students and faculty canvassed New 
Haven neighborhoods to publicize 
their concerns about the trial. The 
baseball team donated the proceeds 
from its games to the Black Student 
Alliance; the track team withdrew 
from the Penn Relays. Singing groups 
held jams to raise money for the 
Panthers' defense. 

A 
daily 
strike 
newspaper began publishing from 
Dwight Hall. In its first issue of April 
24, it reported class attendance had 
dropped by between 65 
and 75 
percent. 

More than 400 professors attended a 
special faculty meeting in Sprague 
Hall on April 23 to discuss the trial and 
the strike. While hundreds of demon-
strators clamored outside the building, 
inside Brewster said he was skeptical 
whether black revolutionaries could get 
a fair trial in the U.S. -a statement 
that would cause a national uproar. 
The faculty 
then overwhelmingly 
voted to "modify normal academic 
expectations" and Brewster issued a 
directive supporting the resolution. 
Some professors kept teaching, some 
used class time to discuss racism and 
the trial, and others cancelled class 
altogether. 

As May Day approached, tension on 
campus grew. A week before the rally 
$2500 worth of mercury, which is used 
to make bombs, was swiped from 
Sterling Chemistry lab. Just outside 
New Haven, several hundred shotguns 
with fixed bayonets were stolen from 
the back of a truck. Radical groups 
ranging from the Weathermen to 
Hell's Angels were rumored to be 
arriving in New Haven to torch Yale. 
Administrators began removing vital 
records from the treasurer's office 
and valuable artwork from the 
galleries. The entire Sterling Library 
card catalog was photocopied. 
Telephone linemen 
welded down 
manhole covers to prevent trouble-
makers from severing cables. Students

packed up their stereos and television 
sets and left town. 

The night before May Day, &ichard 
Nixon announced on national tele-
vision that the U.S had invaded 
Cambodia: The disclosure enraged 
students already angry about the 
Vietnam War, and violence seemed 
more likely than ever. 

Attorney 
General John Mitchell dispatched 
4,000 Marines and paratroopers to 
nearby military bases; Governor John 
Dempsey called 2,500 National Guard 
troops into downtown New Haven. 
Brooks said hearing the news of the 
invasion was "the worst moment of that 
spring." 

By the morning of May 1, the city 
was prepared for battle. Plywood 
panels covered the ground-floor 
windows of every building in the 
downtown 
area. 
Police positioned 
themselves on the far end of the Green, 
armed with clubs and tear gas. The 
National Guard stood several blocks 
away. While driving into New Haven 
that morning, Brooks said, he saw a 
long line of troops stationed in front of 
the Grove Street Cemetery beneath the 
words, "The Dead Shall Be Raised." 
He recalled the heavy weaponry and 
the "rifle barrels sticking in every 
direction." 

By afternoon, the climate had 
changed. It was warm and sunny as 
15,000 demonstrators gathered on the 
Green. Loudspeakers blasted "Here 
Comes the Sun" and the message 
repeated, "It's all right . . . . It's all 
right." The sweet smell of marijuana

drifted throu'gh the air. "It was an 
absolutely beautiful day," said Brooks 
Kelley, a historian of Yale. "That 
helped undoubtedly to defuse things 
because it was more like a country fair 
than a place where people were up in 
arms." A few shirtless youths took 
down the American flag and hoisted 
the banner of Abbie Hoffman and 
Jerry Rubin's Yippie Party. A Har-
vard senior told Time magazine, "One 
just should be here, not to trash or 
fight, but to be on the right side." 

The rally itself was a grab bag of 
moderate speeches; 
not even the 
violent rhetoric seemed too menacing. 
"If the U.S. has lost face in Vietnam, 
it's going to lose its ass in Cambodia," 
Hoffman said. "If they find Bobby . . . 
and the Panthers guilty, we're going to 
pick up [the courthouse] and send it to 
the moon." Others preached nonvio-
lence. It was not the time "to kill pigs," 
Panther leader Doug Miranda said. 
He advised the crowd, "When you 
walk around the campus tonight, walk 
hiply, walk quietly." 

Late in 
the afternoon, 
rally 
organizers opened the microphone to 
anyone who wanted to talk. "The result 
was that you got people who were for 
women's rights, gay rights, and any 
cause you can practically thing of," 
Kelley said. "You got these long, long 
speeches for things that had nothing to 
do with the issue at hand, and that had 
to help make it calm. People got a little 
bored." Demonstrators returned to 
colleges for a dinner of soup, brown 
rice, salad, granola and coffee. Some 
snacked on "civil defense survival 
crackers" that had been stored in 
university basements in preparation 
for nuclear war. Students reported the 
crackers were inedible. 

As night fell, fighting broke out. A 
false rumor that police were arresting 
Panthers spread from college to college 
and demonstrators rushed to the 
Green. Hoping to stem the onrushing 
crowds, Coffin handed a 
police 
bullhorn to a young Panther, who 
ordered the crowd, "Back in the 
colleges, you motherfuckers. Anyone 
who stays on the Green is a mother-
fuckin' pig in civilian clothes." As the 
demonstrators retreated, Coffin 
suggested to 
Police Chief James 
Ahem, "Maybe you ought to hire that 
kid." Neither Ahem nor Coffin ever 
saw the bullhorn again, although it was 
heard periodically during the evening. 
Sporadic clashes between demon-
strators and police condnued for 
several hours.
