A Shared History 
Few of the students who hang out at 
the African-American Cultural Center 
know much about May Day. A turn-
over every four years and short 
memories make even 
the 
anti-
aparthied movement of the mid-1980s 
seem like a myth. Faculty have their 
own problems to deal with, and 
reminding aggressively upwardly 
mobile college students of the glory 
days of campus radicalism is not high 
on their agenda. May Day, 1970 starts 
to become a lost piece of history in 
need of recovering, an enterprise 
usually reserved for articles produced 
and consumed by white students. 

This is ironic considering the extent 
to which Yale's African American 
community was implicated in what 
occurred in New !iaven that school 
year of 1969-1970."The series of events 
which climaxed during the night-time 
riots on the weekend of May 1 , 1970 
revolved around us, our particularly 
African-American bodies and their 
right to be. If contemporary black 
Yalies want the visceral and lasting 
marker of their connection to that 
particular moment in history, they 
need do nothing more than look at 
themselves in the mirror. Even among 
the gothic towers of Yale University, 
we are and remain African-American 
people, in the exact same way that 
Alex Rackley was an African-Ameri-
can person, at least until he was 
reduced to a bullet-ridden corpse, 
photographed 
and 
displayed, 
central exhibit in a murder case. 

For African-Americans aware of 
their own history, the truism of the 
mirror carries with it other lessons, one 
of the more important being that 
blackness works out to mean that 
supposedly inalienable rights are 
actually alienable. The charges of 
physical and psychological abuse 
leveled against the police by the 14 
Black Panther Party prisoners, thrown 
in jail as a result of Rackley's murder, 
were indications of the brutality of 
white supremacy in America. 

If, as is commonly alleged, the 
Federal government hired another 
African-American to murder Rackley,

anti-racist struggle had been inverted, 
directed inward instead of outward at 
racist structures. 

Black-on-black 
violence always serves the interests of 
racism, as it leaves the work of 
destroying African-Americans in our 
own hands. By 1970, the fate intended 
for African-American radicals was so 
obvious that on the first weekend of 
May, thousands 
gathered to show 
their outrage as well as their support 
for the Black Panther Party. 

The truth of the matter, which 
wasn't at all discernable on May 1, was 
that this gathering was the Party's 
proverbial swan-song. May, 1970 was 
too early to gauge the long term impact 
of the Rackley murder, both upon the 
internal politics of the Party and the 
Party's relationship to its constituents. 
Instead of marking the demise of a 
movement, it seemed to mark quite the 
opposite. The weekend saw a broad 
coalition of progressive forces coming 
together, and was a moment when 
Yale's student body, black and white, 
seemed solid in their support of the 
Party. If the picnic on the Green wasn't 
quite the revolution everyone was 
talking about, at least it seemed at the 
time that it wouldn't be long before 
something happened. 

A few things did. The first is that it 
started to become obvious that the war 
in Vietnam could not continue any 
longer. As this hope became a reality, 
widespread white interest in radical 
movements collapsed. The next thing 
that happened is that the early victories 
of the civil rights movement, specifi· 
cally school desegregation efforts and 
effective affirmative action policies, 
produced a generation of African· 
American college students who passed 
through a system that seemed to work 
unusually 
well 
for them. 
This 
gradually caused a general shift in 
African-American students' attitudes. 
More securely bourgeois than their 
predecessors, 
these students could 
afford 
more 
reformist 
political 
postures, that is when they 
ev~n 
thought about politics. T hose who sull 
harbored more radical tendencies were 
as ineffective 
in confronting the 
systemic face of racism as their more 
conservative classmates. These 
students 
usually 
waged 
forms of 
warfare which 
were specificallY 
academic and of little 
use to 
communities outside of the universitY·
