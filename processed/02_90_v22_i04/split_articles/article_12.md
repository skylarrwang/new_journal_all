Women breeze in and out of the Center next door to Durfee's Sweet Shop all day. In a front room jammed with ragged couches, piles of posters, and free condoms, students check the chalkboard calendar for meetings and conferences. Right now, the calendar is especially full. It is the 20th anniversary of women at Yale, and celebratory events are planned for almost every week of the semester. But even without the recent events, the Yale Women's Center regularly invites over 10 groups to meet in its space. These groups address a variety of issues, from date rape to dieting to birth control. 

As it has expanded since 1970, the Center has publicized women's concerns on campus. And over the years, the same concerns have come up again and again: paid parental leave, on-site University-subsidized day care, and more aggressive recruiting of female professors. Not until this year did Yale President Benno Schmidt agree to establish specific positions for women on the faculty. 

While this year's 20th anniversary celebration spotlights female students, the first co-educational class at Yale spent its second semester thrown into a movement that did not champion the rights of women. Beyond the call for day care, none of the official May Day demands recognized women's interests. 

A small group of women tried to capitalize on the spirit of social reform. During the 1970 student strike, they circulated a list of demands, prodding the University to increase female representation on the faculty, end job segregation for non-faculty workers, provide paid maternity leaves, and strive for a 50-50 male-female student ratio. They also wanted better gynecological services at the Department of University Health Services and a department of Women's Studies taught and administered by women. 

None of these demands was met until nine years later, when the University founded the Women's Studies program. Faculty numbers have risen from one female professor for every hundred male professors in 1970, to eighteen per hundred in 1990, an increase of less than one per year. 

Women now make up only 45 percent of the student body. Most of the other demands from 1970 remain unanswered. 

The women who spoke out that spring had not yet organized a formal movement, and represented a small percentage of the female population on campus. Often, they had a hard time even getting together. "None of us knew each other because 'of the way they divided us up into different colleges," said Virginia Diamond (BR '73). Susanne Wofford, associate professor of English and a member of Yale's first co-ed class, does not recall any women's activism during that time. "My impression is that there wasn't very much that was done specifically for women by women," she said. Diamond, Wofford, and other women joined in the protests for the civil rights of African-Americans instead. 

In the midst of the demonstration, a few women managed to set up a temporary women's center on the second floor of SSS Hall. Throughout the weekend, visiting female protesters from colleges around New England could seek refuge there. The center scheduled workshops like "Sexism and Racism," "Women Revolutionaries," and "Venceramos Brigade." 

Some women were angry that their concerns received little attention in 1970. A poster tacked up outside Mory's announced: "If we were black or Mexican-American or American Indian, would you understand our RAGE better? Why can't you translate your 'liberal' views into human rights for all people?" 

Although the Black Panthers overshadowed feminist sentiment that term, women's activism did not subside when the Panther trials ended. 

"The women's movement was still gaining momentum," said Diamond, now a labor lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union. "In reaction to the male domination of the civil rights and antiwar movements, women were getting really interested in feminist issues." 

Today Yale men, too, have joined the women's movement, particularly to fight for reproductive rights. The recently formed Yale chapter of "Students Organizing Students" is a pro-choice group led by both men and women. With the group, women hope that men will come to understand many of the other issues that concern them. To make institutional change, women and men will have to work together.
