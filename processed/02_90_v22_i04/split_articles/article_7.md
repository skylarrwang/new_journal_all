T h is semester 
marks 
the 
20th 
anniversary of May Day at Yale. In 
the spring of 1970, across the country, 
campus radicalism was at its height. 
Students at 450 colleges went on strike 
in opposition to the Vietnam War. Six 
of them were shot by National Guards-
men at Kent and Jackson State. The 
turmoil of the 1960s suddenly erupted 
at Yale when the national leader of the 
Black Panther Party stood trial for 
murder in the New Haven courthouse. 
15,000 protesters rolled in from out of 
town for a massive May 1 rally on the 
Green. Professors, local shopkeepers 
and alumni remember that weekend 
vividly. The National Guard marched 
down York Street; a cloud of tear gas 
hovered over the campus; a bomb 
exploded in Ingalls Rink. 

In addition to compiling these recol-
lections, TN] writers sifted through 
files in Sterling Library's Manuscripts 
and Archives room. We uncovered 
mimeographed flyers that read "Power 
to the People" and "Pigs Must Die," 
and pored over hasty, handwritten 
manifestos by students busy planning 
the strike, the university shut-down, 
the revolution ... 

Among the documents stuffed to-
gether in the library's May Day 
Collection, a menu, xeroxed onto a 
sheet of orange, recycled paper lists the 
meals available 
for 25 cents that 
weekend at Dwight H all: Familia, 
skim milk, fruit punch and instant tea. 
On the back of the menu, an anony-
mous student has scrawled a few notes 
in a fervent shorthand: "institutionalism 
of racism is most important ... New 
Haven people- Black, Irish, Russian, 
Italian . . . I came up thru structure 
and made it- and they can't." Further 
down in the margin, he has summar-
ized his internal struggles with this 
political 
insight: 
"2 conflicting 
desires- to get 
the final 
all-
encompassing analysis/perspective or 
to act on what I know." 

Toward the end of the spring term 
in 1970, Yale suspended classes and 
allowed students like this anonymous 
scribbler to act- to respond to the 
injustice they saw around them. The 
archives contain a chorus of other 
notes, an nouncements and minutes 
from meetings that document the 
results of this experiment. These 
eager, earnest jottings have a familiar

tone. It is easy to imagine the authors, 
huddled together around dining hall 
tables, or staying up all night in their 
dorm rooms. Like us, they were 
troubled by the vast problems of 
racism and oppression. And they, too, 
felt ambivalent about their respon-
sibility as Yale students to the city and 
the society around them. 

In many ways, though, the student 
movement of the 1960s and '70s has 
made us more ambivalent. We roman-
ticize the idealism of that era, even as 
we are cynical about it. Words like 
"Establishment" and "Power Structure" 
sound dated. 
All that talk about 
revolution, we are told, was just a lot of 
empty posturing. 

Shortly after May Day,John Hersey 
wrote a book about student activism at 
Yale, the first chapter of which he titled 
"On Bullshit.'' Before we can under-
stand the student movement of the 
1960s, Hersey wrote, we must dig 
through the layer of rhetoric that 
obscures what was real and relevant 
about the changes of that time. This is 
the challenge we share with the anony-
mous writer working out a political 
agenda on the back of his menu. How 
can we students apply our new-found 
wisdom to society's most entrenched 
problems? How much of our insight is 
valid and how much is just a lot ofb.s.? 
Finally, how much of the talk, the 
posture, and the idealism of the 1960s' 
radicalism can we laugh or sneer at in 
retrospect, and how much must we 
accept as shaping our political reality 
today? 

In this issue, we make no pretense of 
giving a definitive account of the 
1960s, or even of May Day at Yale. 
What we have done is to assemble a 
few scraps of history: an unpublished 
poem by Allen Ginsberg, some of the 
early Yale cartoons of Garry Trudeau, 
and interviews with people who were· 
here back then- Rosey of Rosey's 
Cleaners, Bobby Seale, Dean Donald 
Kagan, Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Balti-
more, and others. Their memories and 
opinions offer us a glimpse of the 
bullshit and reality of May Day, and 
maybe 
tell 
us 
somethmg about 
ourselves.
