The King's Conundrum 
David Greenberg 
Just after midnight on the morning of 
May 1, 1970, two cars drove up to the 
president's house. A small group of 
well-known radicals made.their way up 
the front steps and into the foyer, 
where Yale President Kingman 
Brewster waited to escort them to his 
capacious living room. The radi-
cals- three of them members of the 
Chicago Seven, on trial for conspiring 
to 
riot at the 
1968 Democratic 
convention- stood uncomfortably for 
a few minutes, looking at one another: 
Tom Hayden, the scruffy founder of 
Students for a Democratic Society; 
John Froines, a Yale Ph.D. and 
leading academic voice against the 
Vietnam War; his wife Anne; and 
David Dellinger (YC '36), the middle-
aged veteran of the peace movement 
who was to direct the next day's rally. 
Brewster had arranged this secret 
negotiating session on the eve of May 
Day to find out what the radicals had 
in store for 
tomorrow's demon-
strations. 

Hayden described the meeting in his 
memoir. "Everyone graciously tiptoed 
around the issue of what would happen 
in the street," he said, until he 
took it upon himself to break the ice. 
"After the diplomatic niceties had gone 
on for half an hour, I interjected: 
'Look, let's be very clear. We are not 
necessarily your friends and allies. But 
we- the Chicago defendants- agree 
with the Panthers that there should be 
no violence here this weekend." The 
comment was what Brewster and Yale

Corporation member Cyrus Vance, 
who 
had 
skipped his 
daughter's 
graduation to be there, were wait'lng to 
hear. The two had feared that the May 
Day rally would degenerate into a huge 
brawl. ·

T he demonstration leaders were 
nervous, too. Rumor had it that the 
governor was calling in the National 
Guard to encircle the Green with 
bayonets, and Hayden and his cohorts 
demanded that Brewster keep the 
troops away. After long deliberations, 
"There was something 
of the swashbuckler in 
him. Confrontation fit 
his style." 
the rally leaders pledged to keep the 
crowd calm, in exchange for a promise 
from Brewster to try to reposition the 
Guard. But what the radicals did not 
know was that the troops would not be 
there anyway. 
"We had 
already 
worked it out with the Guard not to be 
around the Green," Brewster told an 
interviewer later. "But I had to have 
some bargaining power." 

Kingman Brewster had pulled off 
another of the diplomatic master-
strokes that made him famous during 
May Day. Always cultivating the 
image of approachability, the president 
invited the Chicago defendants into his 
living room, just as he welcomed 
thousands of radicals into the college 
that weekend. Yet all the while he was 
working in the back room, orches-
trating the "events to make sure they 
stayed under his control. 

Throughout the turbulent spring of 
1970, 
Brewster continually ma-
neuvered . between leftwing students 
who denounced him as a symbol of 
Establishment authority and conser-
vative alumni who decried the liberal 
reforms he brought to Old Yale. 
Representatives of both sides took 
issue with Brewster's behavior during 
May Day. "We have endeavored to be 
good Yale men," wrote one member of 
the class of 1905. "Brewster is a better 
Black Panther than he is a Yale man 
... Yale, as always, should be for God 
and for Country and run by true Yale 
men." Meanwhile, Yippie leader Jerry 
Rubin made his case to a group 
gathered in Woolsey Hall. "Fuck 
Kingston Brewer," he explained. "The 
pressures were on all sides," said 
Professor Emeritus of Political Science 
Robert Lane, who stayed on campus 
for the weekend. 

But it was precisely during such 
challenging times, colleagues say, that 
Brewster was at his best. "There was 
something of the swashbuckler in 
him," said Professor of French Georges 
May, dean of the college during May 
Day. "Confrontation fit his style." 

Indeed, . from the beginning of his

President Kingman Brewster managed to keep things calm. 
presidency, Brewster found himself in 
one duel after another. A liberal 
Republican and the scion of an old 
New England family, Brewster came 
to Yale as the protege of Yale President 
A. Whitney Griswold, a family friend. 
When Griswold died in 1963, Brewster 
became president. While the Old Blues 
expected him to live up to his patri-
cian 
image, 
he 
instead began 
to toss aside their most cherished 
traditions. 

Under Brewster's leadership, Yale 
dropped its coat-and-tie rule and 
widened its admissions policies. The 
University began actively recruiting 
minorities, admitted women as under-
graduates for the first time, and 
abandoned its favoritism toward prep-
school kids and sons of Yale graduates. 
"He had an astounding ability to turn 
off alumni," said Brooks Kelley, who 
wrote a history of Brewster's presi-
dency. While Brewster succeeded in 
making Yale 
more diverse, 
the 
University paid a price- in dollars. 
Upset 
because 
they 
thought the 
president had compromised Yale's 
integrity, or simply because their sons 
weren't being admitted, 
alumni 
stopped giving and the endowment 
suffered. Many saw Brewster as an 
upstart. "They were used to being 
treated in a certain way. Then there 
was a shift," Kelley said. "It seemed 
like a snub." 

Even as an undergraduate in the 
elite Yale of the 1930s, Brewster felt no 
tie to tradition for its own sake. When 
his peers dutifully lined up on the Old 
Campus on secret society tap night, 
Brewster hid in a closet in Davenport 
College to avoid being selected for 
Skull and Bones. The Bonesmen found 
him and tapped him anyway, but 
Brewster held 
to his egalitarian 
principles and refused to join. 

Brewster's readiness to defy tradition 
helped him to meet the challenges of 
the spring of 1970. "Because he didn't 
worship at the altar of Eli Yale, he was 
able to think of original things to do," 
Lane said. In his decision to open the 
University to the demonstrators, 
Brewster broke with the prevailing 
wisdom of the day. Administrators at 
Columbia, 
Corn"ell 
and numerous 
other universities adopted a hard line 
against protesters, while enraged stu-
dents torched buildings and rioted. 

Brewster and his special assistant 
Henry "Sam" Chauncey, Jr. thought it 
might make sense to try something 
different. Rather than chaining up 
Yale like a fortress, they decided to 
throw open the gates and allow the 
demonstrators to eat and sleep in the 
colleges as guests of the students. 
Chauncey said the decision reflected 
Brewster's pragmatic mind. "I don't 
want to disillusion anybody, but this 
wasn't some high and lofty principle, 
saying let's 
open our arms and 
welcome the opposition," .he said. 
"This was a pragmatic decision. If we 
didn't open the colleges, what would 
happen? The answer was it would 
probably cause a hell of a lot of 
trouble." After an April 15 rally in 
Cambridge, where demonstrators laid 
waste to Harvard Square, Chauncey, 
Brewster and others began to worry. 
"A lot of people left town because 
they felt we were being invaded by the 
Visigoths," May said. "The physical 
danger was real-of fire, of firearms." 

On April 27, a fire broke out in the 
Law School library, damaging $2000 
worth of books, and on May Day 
weekend the Panther headquarters 
burned down. Chauncey and Brewster 
figured that if thousands of demon-
strators came streaming toward Yale 
after the rally on the Green, de-
termined to get in, 
would 
probably succeed. To try to keep them 
out would only antagonize them. 

"The opening of the colleges was a 
lot easier a decision than you might 
imagine," Chauncey said. "Getting 
other people to buy into the decision 
was a lot harder." Conservative critics 
argued that opening up the University 
constituted nothing less than caving in 
to the radicals. Many of the college 
masters, moreover, were teluctant to 
let so many strangers into their college 
rooms and courtyards, fearing for their

students'- and their own- safety. 

Brewster the diplomat went to work. 
He spent hours on the telephone, over 
lunch at Mory's, and in his office, 
cajoling and convincing the masters 
and faculty into accepting his proposal. 
"He was a great politician," May said. 
"He knew that he could have his way as 
long as most of his constituents were 
going to support him." 

Slowly, 
Brewster and Chauncey 
wrung concessions out of the masters. 
They began by asking that students be 
allowed to host one guest apiece. After 
the masters agreed, they pushed it up 
to two. "We did things gradually," 
Chauncey said. 

In the weeks before May Day, 
Brewster circulated among the 
colleges, chatting with . students and 
faculty, hearing their concerns. "He 
would go to students' meetings in the 
colleges 
and 
be 
available 
for 
questions," Lane said. "He talked 
easily to the faculty. He was just 
generally responsive." Whether 
Brewster was making the rounds 
actually to hear student complaints or 
simply to give the impression of being 
a receptive president, he succeeded in 
winning a large following among stu-
dents and faculty alike. "He was a very 
attractive and charming guy in small 
groups," said Kelley. "He was good at 
defusing pent-up emotions." 

Still, tensions ran high that spring as 
the University became increasingly 
involved in the Black Panther trial. 
Black students and faculty called for 
Yale to donate money to the Panthers' 
defense. Brewster insisted the Uni-
versity could not take a political stance 
without undermining its academic 
mission. Yet at a faculty meeting on 
April 23, he said: "In spite of my 
insistence on the limits of my official 
capacity, I personally want to say that I 
am appalled and ashamed that things 
should have come to such a pass that I 
am skeptical of the ability of black 
revolutionaries to achieve a fair trial 
anywhere in the United States." Al-
though as president of Yale he could 
not involve himself in the issue, as a 
private citizen, he said, he sympa-
thized with the Panthers. 
18 The New JournaVFebruary 2, 1990 

Brewster intended the statement as a 
gesture of conciliation toward the 
Panther supporters. "For black faculty, 
it indicated a concern about what was 
important to them," Kelley said. "A lot 
of this was symbolism." Brewster said 
that although the sentiments he ex-
pressed were genuine, he was acting 
strategically as well. "This was for the 
purpose of trying . . . to unify the 
faculty," he said. As Chauncey put it, 
"He wanted to keep the place from 
falling apart." Still, not everyone was 
convinced. 

Dean Donald Kagan 
thought the statement was a "sell-out," 
radicals doubted Brewster's 
sincerity. 
,, 

"If the Establishment 
hates him, there must 
be something good 
about him." 

Chauncey, who had helped Brewster 
draft the speech, said that he had not 
expected the 
skeptici~m remark to 
attract so much attention. 
The 
national news media quickly picked it 
up, however, and no less a figure than 
the Vice-President of the United 
States, Spiro Agnew, entered the fray. 
In 
a 
tirade against Yale at 
Republican 
fundraising 
speech 
in 
Florida, Agnew denounced Brewster 
Yale with his characteristic 
demagogic zeal. 

He called the Panthers "an organi-
zation dedicated to criminal violence, 
anarchy and the destruction of the 
United States of America," and 
recommended, "it is time for the 
alumni of the fine old college to 
demand that it be headed by a more 
mature a nd reponsible person. 
President Brewster of Yale has also 
stated that he does not feel that black 
revolutionaries can get a fair trial 
within our judicial system. I do not feel 
that students of Yale University can get 
a fair impression of their country 
under the 
tutelage of Kingman 
Brewster." 

Agnew's 
philippic 
backfired. If 
anything, 
his denunciation 
rallied 
support for Brewster on campus. 
Students who otherwise attacked 
Brewster as a figure of authority and 
oppression now began to wonder if he 
was not on their side after all. 

Chauncey summarized the popular 
opinion: "If the establishment hates 
him, there must be something good 
about him." May said that Agnew's 
remarks also swung the moderates to 
Brewster's side. "Even people who did 
not support Brewster felt if you had to 
make a choice between the two of 
them, you were not going to choose the 
Vice-President." Brewster received one 
petition of support signed by 438 
professors and another signed by 3000 
students. 

A week and a half later, with May 
Day safely behind him and Yale still 
standi.ng, national attention focused on 
Brewster again. On May 
11 
brought a contingent of 1200 Yale 
students to Washington D.C. to lobby 
their congressmen to end the Vietnam 
War. Calling up senators and repre-
sentatives who had graduated from 
Yale, Brewster arranged for them to 
meet with the students. Fifteen buses 
left Phelps Gate at 2:30 a.m. carrying 
students to the capital. 

Meanwhile, 
Brewster, who had 
spoken out against the war before, flew 
down with Vance, trustee William 
Horowitz, Professors Edmund Mor-
gan and James Tobin, and four 
students in tow. Students broke down 
into groups according to their home 
states and visited with their repre-
sentatives; Brewster's group spent the 
day with nine congressmen, including 
two Republicans named Gerald Ford 
and George Bush. After the meeting 
Bush remarked that he had gotten a 
"full-court 
press from the Yale 
students." 

Again, Brewster's motives mystified 
many. Why would he stir up more 
controversy so soon after he had 
survived the greatest challenge of his
