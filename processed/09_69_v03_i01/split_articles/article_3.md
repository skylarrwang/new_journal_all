and the insanity of another culture's 
sexual mores has zeroed in on the lower 
classes who cannot afford the one thousand 
dollars needed for a stint in London or 
Japan or the seven hundred dollars going 
rate for top illicit abortions in New York 
City. One of the more important aspects of 
the Yale-New Haven Hospital's healthier 
abortion attitude is that it provides that 
needed commodity to those who cannot 
afford more expensive routes. 

In Connecticut, legal abortion can be 
performed for three reasons: if the 
mother's physical or mental health is in 
grave danger, if the pregnancy is a result 
of rape or incest or if the baby will be 
born with serious congenital defects. This 
is no new or enlightened law; it has been 
on the books since 1861 and has rarely 
been used. One look at another commu-
nity shows why. In Hartford, for example, 
there are three major hospitals, Needless 
to say, Catholic-run St. Francis simply 
never performs legal abortions. Hartford 
Hospital, the largest and most modern, 
run by those same forces which guide the 
large insurance companies and banks, 
discourages them incredibly. The third 
hospital, Mt. Sinai, run by the Jewish 
community, is paranoid about being 
known as the abortion mill. 

So it takes a large institution which 
decides in its guts to be enlightened to 
perform legal abortions-and Yale-New 
Haven is just that. 

Dr. Clarence Davis, a paternal looking 
man with straight white hair shooting 
forward to the top of the forehead, out-
lining a friendly fleshy face, is an ob-
stetrician at the Yale-New Haven Hos-
pital and chairman of the Connecticut 
Abortion Legal Reform Association. 
"More and more people are beginning 
to simpJy demand their rights and eleven 
states have enacted more progressive 
legislation," said Davis, explaining why 
the number of legal abortions is rising 
across the country. "In this hospital, 
thank God, we have an intelligent, forth-
right attitude." 

Another prominent New Haven physi-
cian who, while not directly related to the 
Hospital, helps women to obtain safe abor-
tions said, "I personally feel that no 
woman should be forced to have a child 
she does not want-single, married or 
in any other category. I think a lot of 
physicians take this attitude now. My feel-
ing is that there is enough unhappiness 
and unrest in life, and that a child has a 
much better chance of living a normal 
healthy life, psychiatrically and other-
wise, if he's loved. If he is not loved his 
chances of becoming a useful citizen are 
very markedly decreased." 

With the plethora of birth-control in-
formation, pills and devices that abound, 
one would think there would be very few 
unwanted pregnancies, but that isn't true. 
"Single girls, particularly, get in a situa-
tion where they have intercourse without 
any type of contraception, thinking 
they're not at the time of the cycle where 
they're likely to get pregnant. Some of 
them are just plain stupid. Some of them 
get pregnant, I'm sure, to punish them-
selves, or their parents-and not infre-
quently their parents-not consciously of 
course, but psychologically. Then they get 
tremendous guilt complexes about all this 
and frequently do not tell their parents. 
"I also run across the situation where 
the girl is exposed to pregnancy, (has 
coitus or coitus is attempted) and she 
stops menstruating and is not pregnant. 
I've had two of these in the last three 
months, and it's totally psychological," 
said the private physician who wishes to 
remain anonymous. 

Reasons for unwanted pregnancy di-
vide along socio-economic lines. Girls 
who become pregnant to punish their 
parents are from middle and upper class 
families, while the few pregnancies result-
ing from ignorance of birth control pro-
cedure are in the lower class. In general, 
abortion is a luxury of the.affiuent, like 
the Holy Writs of Assistance, with women 
of lesser means often dying from hemorr-
haging or infection due to illicit abor-
tions done by untrained people with total 
ignorance of aseptic techniques. Yale-
New Haven Hospital has led a morally 
constipated state in providing expert legal 
abortions for women of all economic 
backgrounds. 

Three operating procedures are used 
by the hospital. If the pregnancy is less 
than ten weeks, a normal scraping of the 
uterine wall is performed. After ten weeks 
of pregnancy, hypertonic saline solution 
is injected into the uterus, inducing labor. 
In women of middle age, when requested 
and deemed all right, a sterilization is also 
performed, and the uterus is simply 
removed. 

While the legal abortion is the safest 
and least traumatic means of terminating 
pregnancy, it is still acknowleged to be 
one hell of a psychologically painful 
event- and in many cases the men 
take an active part in comforting the 
patient. 

"Frequently the man is there, whether 
the couple is married or not," he said. 
"The difficult thing is when the relation-
ship is not a very serious one, where 
marriage isn't seriously contemplated. 
The minute a man learns that his partner 
is pregnant, he's long gone. And it's a 
terribly hard thing psychologically for the 
girl, for she is almost always deeply emo-
tionally involved, or she wouldn't be 
having intercourse. There are promiscuous 
girls, sure, but they aren't the ones that get 
pregnant. It's the girl who's in love and 
starry-eyed that gets herself in trouble. 
"And there are some girls who get 
pregnant to try and catch a man. That's 
the worst way in the world. When a girl 
gets pregnant to solidify a relationship, 
the relationship is doomed," said the 
physician. 

At least legal means of abortions do 
exist. That any anti-abortion laws at all 
still exist as part of a criminal code of law, 
is a comment on society which some 
might call male-chauvinistic; others 
insane. ~
