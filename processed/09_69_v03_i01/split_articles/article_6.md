The American Moon landing was a pretty big fat 
deal. Everyone knew that. If you hadn't known that, 
someone would have told you. Ute paid Norman 
Mailer millions to write a book about what he 
thought of it. The New York Times Magazine ran an 
article by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. making fun of the idea 
and Implying that Isaac Asimov was the only space 
scientist around with any brains or integrity. Follow-
ing It in the magazine was an article by Isaac 
Asimov, describing the landing as the most significant 
scientific enterprise of all time. Department stores 
in Japan sold plastic models of the ship which the 
three Americans would fly to the Moon. The largest 
newspaper in Yugoslavia offered $800 as a prize to 
anyone who could predict th& words which the first 
American to walk on the Moon would say. Esquire 
had the same Idea and printed what 52 famous 
people, from Vladimir Nabokov to Hubert Humphrey, 
thought the first American Moon-walker-talker 
should say. In Colombia the government asked tele-
vision set makers to install T.V.'s in the main squares 
of all Colombian towns and in the windows of most 
stores so that the people could follow the progress 
of the !light. Even the Russians knew perfectly well 
about 1t. They weren't saying anything though. They 
stayed off to themselves, sulking in their vodka. 
It was a very big fat deal indeed, let me tell you. 
But it wasn't just the Americans who had made it 
that to be snotty. Everyone had. H. G. Wells had, and 
he was English. Jules Verne had, and he was French. 
The Moon-goers were to blast off on Wedr.esday 
from Cape Kennedy, the usual place. By Sunday 
evening everything was ready, including the televi-
sion sets in Colombia. Thousands of people had 
already gat.hered in the take-off area, Launching Pad 
39-A, to watt. 

On Tuesday the New York Times printed large pic-
tures of the three men on the front page and reported 
that at a news conference they had said they were 
'Confident of Success.' Or, at least, they were still 
willing to go. 'In Last Appearance Before Trip, They 
Disclaim Fear,' the Times said. 

On Wednesday the Times showed a picture of 
l~ndon Johnson and his wife shaking hands with an 
A1r Force general. The headline stretching across 
~r.ee of the Times' columns (and the Times is very 
ftnlcky about the Integrity of those columns) said: 
THREE APOLLO ASTRONAUTS POISED TO SET OUT TODAY 
ON MOON LANDING MISSION just in case anyone hadn't 
already heard. 

That was Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday. But 
!he funny thing was that on Monday, when I walked 
mto Parmelee and Howe's Drug and Hardware Store 
David Quammen, a senior In Calhoun is a scholar of 
the house working on a screenplay of William 
Faulkner's Absalom, Absalom. 
in Wilmington, Vermont, the Brattleboro Reformer, 
which does have a rather lax column policy, looked 
up at me from the wire stand at the end of the cos-
metics aisle and, in a three inch high black-lettered 
headline straight across the page said this: 
REDS LAUNCH MOON-SHIP. 

It meant the Russians. It meant that they had 
sneaked off to their own launch pad, in the midst of 
all the international whoop-de-doo, and had gotten 
a ship of their own on Its way to the Moon. Our Moon. 
I pulled the Brattleboro Reformer o ut of the rack and 
read the article. 

It was an unmanned Soviet space vehicle called 
Luna 15 with a lunar destination, Tass, the official 
Soviet news agency, had announced. That was all 
they had announced. It was believed by some Ameri-
can space officials that the vehicle may have been 
on Its way to a soft-landing on lunar turf, the article 
said. It was further believed, this time by a man 
named Sir Bernard lovell of London, who is ap-
parently the closest thing to a "space official" that 
England can claim, that "the Soviet spacecraft 
would attempt to land on the Moon and bring back 
samples of Its surface." Before the Americans, get It? 
Sir Bernard said there was "every indication" that 
that was what the Reds' ship was up to. 

It meant, the Brattleboro Reformer thought, 
and said so, that the Russians were involved in a 
LAST DITCH EFFORT TO STEAL SPACE SHOW. 

In other words, those Russians were down, but 
they weren't out. 

It meant to Sir Bernard that there was no inter-
national cooperation in space, a fact which he found 
" sad and regrettable." Sir Bernard also said that if 
international collaboration didn't develop, say, in 
the next ten years, "a very serious situation might 
arise, both scientifically and politically." 

I left the Parmelee and Howe Drug and Hardware 
Store with a smug and ironic impression that the 
Russians were doing a very silly thing. And that 
this incident, coupled with a long and conspicous 
record of past silliness, demonstrated to my satis-
faction, if not all the world's, that, in the case of the 
Soviet Union, we were dealing with what was simply 
a downright silly nation. 
I meant more so than most 
On Wednesday morning at 9:28a.m. the countdown 
was at 4-minutes-19-seconds-and-counting. That was 
the point at which I turned on the radio, while I was 
waiting for my Cheerios to get soggy. At T-mlnus-45-
seconds-and-counting I dropped a slice of cinnamon 
bread into the toaster and pushed it down, with the 
setting on light. I listened to the countdown with a 
blase but glassy-eyed recognizance of the frontiers 
of my responsibility. At T-minus-zero-and-Biastoff 
my cinnamon toast sprung up. I laughed at the co-
incidence, and three eager, clear-eyed Americans 
headed for the Moon. 

On Thursday afternoon it was hot and humid, so I 
sat on the sleeping porch, listened to intermittent 
distant rumblings of thunder and read Wednesday's 
New York Times. It's the one with the three-column 
headline that wasn't bad news and the pictu re of 
President Johnson and even Mrs. Johnson. I looked 
carefully all over the front page but couldn't find 
anything about the Soviet-launched attempt to steal 
the space show. The Times wasn't having any of it. 
They weren't letting themselves be a party to the 
theft. The Times is a serious and plenty smart opera-
tion and not prone to concerning themselves with 
silly and faddish vagaries such as the Soviet Union's 
rockets to the Moon. So I read the articles on 
Apollo 11. 

The big day found me eating Sunday brunch with 
Walter Cronkite. The ship had already come to 
ground when I tuned in, at a place called Landing 
Site Two, in the Sea of Tranquility, a plain near the 
crater Moltke, which is on the right side of the Moon 
as seen from here, Cronkite was explaining. Only 
Armstrong and Aldrin were in the funny little vehicle 
that had been taken, like a small motorboat, to the 
landing spot. Collins had been left behind up above, 
going around in circles by himself. 

But the two American Moon-walkers hadn't 
stepped out. They hadn't started without me. They

r were sitting there, in their two custom comfort-
cushioned body chairs, on the Moon, looking out 
the window. Trading a lot of very jargony mformation 
with the man at M.C. Throwing in a poetic flourish 
occasionally. 

And then one of them held the portable live color 
T.V. camera up to the window, pointed it out, and 
let me, all of us, look. 

At the surface of the Moon. 

Ooooooooooh. 

It looked like a great plain of green cheese that 
"" 
had turned grey and crumbly from age and exposure 
and had been hit by a lot of meteors and asteroids. 
It looked about like the fold-out photographs I had 
seen in Life, only closer. And the colors weren't 
quite as clear. 

Â· 
"Get on with the show," I said out loud after having 
been shown the surface of the Moon for a straight 
twenty minutes. I had finished the last syrupy waffle 
of my brunch, had listened patiently to a crackling 
radio catechatation full of in-talk about radar sitings 
and rnagnometer readings between Module and 
Control and I was getting bored. "Is this all?" I de-
manded, turning my back to carry away the tray 
table. At this apogee, crucial for me (and, I was sure, 
for probably a good third or so of that 150-million-
American audience that was tuned in at that point), 
the entire Apollo program was slumping to a perigee 
where it seemed just about the right time to go out 
and visit the john. 

C'mon! I hounded Moon-ward. Let's get on with 
the real show. The walking-around stuff. The poking-
our-noses-around-behind craters stuff. The first big 
~ 
fat man-talking-Moon-words-back-to-little-old-earth-
ears stuff. Get out of that space ship, you phonies. 
Shuffle, shuffle. Stomp stomp stomp. Hoot hoot. 

At KLH, 
we believe there is a special kind of delight 
to be gained from using a minimum of apparatus 
to fill a room with music.

And then down the gang plank, television camera 
now blazing gloriously away in living lunar olive-grey 
color, go the two clear-eyed courageous, athletic, 
American family boys and good father type~, onto 
the Sea of Tranquility, the never-touched-by-foot- . 
before surface gravel of the long-espied lunar turf, 
where the tungsten-wrapped magnet-foot of Mr. 
Neil Armstrong, Moon-walker, is trod into contact 
with same and releases radio-fast earthward to two 
billion listening people-ears the first lunar sound of 
crunch. 

1 drank off the last grainy drops of that coffee and 
set the cup down quickly with a clank on the floor, 
pushed it right away from me, out of the way, moving 
face-forward elbows on knees. 

"The words!" I reminded. " The man-first Moon-
words," I practically had to holler to them. "Speech!" 
... Son-of-a-bitch. Those crazy, loony-
-What's that, Neil? Where ... 

And a long, sweeping lunarscape pan right, 
whoops, object, stop, focus in, two objects, zoom in, 
focus in, clear shot of Commander Neil, some forty 
yards off across the Sea, shiny spacesuit posing 
small beside large object, further zoom and focus, 
large module object of a parked-not-far-off Luna 15, 
C.C.C.P. and unmistakable old familiar hammer-and-
sickle trademark clearly lettered on its side. That's 
what we saw-at least I did-when the show really 
got started. And not for long either, boy. That and 
one other thing: a sign, billboard-like, opened 
automatic from the side of Luna, presented. outward 
to easy all-eye view on a ten-foot square iron panel 
in yellow day-glo paint, in English, professionally 
lettered, you bet: AMERICAN IMPERIALIST COLONIALIST 
AGGRANDIZEMENT AND AGGRESSION CONTINUES 
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND UNIVERSE. 

Hoooooboy. Fade to black. Back to M.C. work 
room, I mean, what's going on? Smile workers, don't 
look so shook, keep calm, for the fol~s at home. I 
don't know, what? No. Walter doesn't know either. 
Huh? Cut to commercial. 

"Hey, M.C., what do we do?" 
" ... Dismantle it ... " 
" ... What? Listen, put the computer on, will you. 
I don't ... " 
" ... Proceed, over ... This is official, verified, 
Neil, over ... " 
" ... But isn't that against international law? ... " 
" ... Ordinarily, yes. But they did it first. They 
profaned the Moon. Proceed, over ... " 

It seemed, at least to me, to be as Sir Bernard 
Lovell had predicted, "a very serious situation, both 
scientifically and politically." 

"Rrrroger M.C." 

So at 1:19 p.m., Sunday afternoon, I turned off the 
Moon show, three hours earlier than I had expected, 
and went out to lie in the sun. Because at 1 :10 p.m. 
(E.D.T.), July 20, with Buz the ex-cameraman standing 
at his right shoulder holding a box of space wrenches, 
Mr. Commander Neil (Jack) Armstrong gave a stiff 
counter-clockwise turn to the third bolt from the 
left on the bottom of the first unmanned Soviet 
space-sign, and Luna 15, rather ferociously, ex-
ceeding deviously, blew itself, him, Buz, and most 
of that corner of the Sea of Tranquility, up, in my face. 

A thirty-minute short subject tape came on all the 
stations then, which Mission Control had quickly 
dug out, about the adventures of American space-
men, their accomplishments and their unbroken line 
of spiritual tradition back to Daniel Boone. It was 
narrated by John Glenn. Songs by the Kingston Trio. 
I had seen it before.
