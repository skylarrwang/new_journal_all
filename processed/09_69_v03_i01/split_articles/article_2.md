**Title: On Getting an Abortion at Yale**
**Author: Jonathan Lear**
**Page number(s): 3**

I was first hit with the whole idea of 
abortion a few years ago when I was 
exorcizing some last shreds of Kennedy 
idealism and bourgeois guilt as a VISTA 
worker in Harlem. One of the nights, 
which were usually dominated by lonely 
introspection and brooding about what 
the hell I was doing there, was interrupted 
by a teenage girl who lived a few floors 
below me in the tenement. Her hands 
worked over the little strands of hair and 
the creases in' her dress which concern 
only those who are upset about something 
and self-conscious. She related a long 
detailed story the gist of which dealt 
with a girl friend who had broken up 
with a boy some time ago and had pro-
ceeded to miss her next period and was 
now three days late for the second, and 
knew she was pregnant. So why tell me? 
Well, this girl was a secretary down-
town, a relatively high paying job, and 
wanted to know if I knew a reputable 
white doctor who she could be sure 
would perform a good operation. I 
didn't-and spent the rest of the night 
feeling that if I could have ever been of 
any use, I had just blown it. 

The next night a screaming ambulance 
pulled up in front of my tenement and I 
saw the girl I had talked to the night 
before wheeled out on a stretcher. The 
gossipy tidbit passed up and down the 
street. By the next afternoon, in the same 
breath as the numbers of the horses that 
had won the races, I heard that the girl's 
mother was in the middle of giving her an 
abortion with a knitting needle when she 
pierced some artery and the blood gushed. 
And gushed. Even in Harlem there are 
blood banks and antibiotics, so the girl 
lived, but she will never give birth to a 
child. So it goes. 

While no one has ever accused the sex 
laws of being sane, and while any con-
ception of the number of deaths and per-
manent damage done by illegal abortions 
would boggle and sicken the mind, abor-
tions are done at Yale-and they are 
done legally. 

Paula came to Yale last year, after 
graduating from a top women's college, 
and got a job with a professor to give 
herself time to think over whether she 
really wanted to go on to graduate school. 
She started dating a graduate student in 
that department and through some sort of 
birth control slip-up soon found herself 
quite pregnant. Her boyfriend felt be-
trayed and trapped and wouldn't have 
anything to do with her. 

There are times to be alone, but this 
was not one of them. Paula paced hyster-
ically up and down her room for a few 
days, afraid to speak to anyone, and 
finally flipped through the yellow pages 
and on sheer intuition selected a private 
gynecologist who she hoped would be 
sympathetic. He was. 

"After the tests showed that I was 
pregnant," said Paula, "he asked me what 
I intended to do. I was so embarrassed and 
upset about the whole thing and was kind 
of falling apart, so he said, 'Ok, how much 
money do you have,' and I didn't have 
any. That was going to be quite a hassle. 
He explained that there were a whole lot 
of different ways to have a good abortion, 
going to Japan or London or going to 
Maryland and saying you were a resident; 
apparently Maryland is very lenient. 
And then he said there was no way it 
could be done in Connecticut, unless 
we could get two psychiatrists to write 
that my mental health was so gravely 
threatened that there was a strong chance 
I would commit suicide. Apparently abor-
tions were being performed at Yale-New 
Haven Hospital, but you could tell that 
if I could afford any other legal way, it 
would have been much easier." 

There was no other way. Paula was 
near broke and couldn't afford long trips, 
so the gynecologist made appointments 
for her to see two psychiatrists known to 
be sympathetic, and to see a prominent 
obstetrician at Yale. 

"I had heard that if I was going to get 
my abortion I would have to make the 
shrinks think I was about to kill myself,'' 
said Paula. "But that was no problem. 
The minute I would walk into their office 
I would somehow become hysterical, and 
I wasn't putting it on. 
''The first shrink I saw was very nice 
and saw that I really was in deep depres-
sion, and he thought it was imperative 
that I have an abortion. The other shrink 
tried to argue and tell me that I could 
force the boy to marry me and told me I 
was being very self-destructive. I just 
sort of fell apart. I felt like a complete 
tramp; I don't know how he did it. He 
had the attitude: 'Well, I suppose I'll 
write the letter for you, but I'm really 
doing you a favor.' And that was probably 
the worst part of the whole business, 
because he made me feel that while I 
might get away with something legally 
I was doing something that was pro-
foundly wrong." 

The psychiatrists did write the letters, 
though, and Paula received a call a week 
later saying a hospital review board had 
gone over her case, and a legal abortion 
would be performed. Paula entered the 
hospital five days later, on a Friday, and 
was back in her apartment on Sunday-
pregnant no longer. 

"The doctor who performed the opera-
tion was so great, so fatherly,'' says Paula. 
"I remember once we were walking down 
the corridor and he put his arm around me 
and said, 'Just hold yourself together, that's 
all I ask. Just hold yourself together.' 
''The whole operation was a real 
nothing. I never felt any pain afterwards, 
except minor cramps the next day. But, 
wow, did I have mental hang ups about it. 
I went through a long period of thinking 
I was a murderess, which I don't think is 
common. It just seemed like the culmin-
ation of a bad dream, or almost like a 
punishment for being a bad girl. And it 
took me a whole year to get over that, 
to learn that the whole value system just 
wasn't functional, to accept the fact that 
I, too, was a sexual human being and had 
to learn to act sensibly, and that it was 
sheer stupidity that got me into this, but 
that there was no reason to feel guilty 
about it for the rest of my life." 

Paula paid forty dollars a shot for each 
psychiatrist, hospital costs amounted to 
three hundred dollars, and the doctor 
performing the operation didn't charge 
her, for he felt she couldn't afford it. 

The Yale Medical School, that co-
lossus to the south, is a series of low-flying 
formidable buildings, standing stolidly 
as a Great Wall, protecting the civilized 
world of the University and downtown 
shopping center from the barbarian 
hordes of the ghettoes. It is also one of 
the few Yale institutions that provide 
valuable services for the entire New 
Haven community. Abortions from 
good underground sources have long 
been handy for society's upper classes;
