City Planning: 
Anatomy 
of a 
Fuck-up 
by Lawrence Lasker

Tunnard: a most important experience 
Last spring, for probably the first time in 
Yale's history, a group of students and 
teachers began to succeed in working 
together to determine the course of their 
learning, their teaching and their lives. 
They failed. What destroyed them was 
their inability to deal with the Yale ad-
ministration, a bureaucracy so blinded by 
the trivia of style and reputation that it 
cannot see a meaning in life beyond the 
perpetuation of its own dreary existence. 

Last spring's effort by a united city 
planning department to enroll a signi-
ficant number of black students into its 
program was effectively discouraged late 
in May when the administration of King-
man Brewster fired the department's 
chairman, fired the art and architecture 
school's assistant dean, promised to fire 
two more department faculty members, 
threatened students with the denial of 
degrees, and, in a word, castrated the en-
tire department. What follows is a rather 
depressing account of what happens when 
you do not play by the rules of the Yale 
Game. Nothing, however, is revealed. 

When Christopher Tunnard returned 
from his sabbatical last December to as-
sume the chairmanship of the city plan-
ning Department, he found that things 
were quite different from when be had 
left. In the space of a year, the city plan-
ners-and even, it seemed, the promise of 
planning cities as a life's work-had ac-
quired a new purpose. The liberal eyes of 
the liberal press were turning their focus 
upon the human destruction done in 
American cities, and they saw the city as 
the nation's most pressing internal prob-
lem. The press began to look for help to 
city planners, the bulk of whom bad con-
centrated their efforts upon such atrocities 
as Ed Logue's "renewal" of New Raven's 
Oak Street ghetto into a shopping magnet 
for suburbanites. (In fact Maurice Rode-
val, who started city planning at Yale, had 
a hand in initiating this affair.) Enlight-
ened planners, who despaired of ever 
getting a chance to put their blueprints 
to the test, suddenly had a reason to ex-
pect that money and opportunity would 
come their way for the massive job of 
rebuilding and humanizing the inner-city 
world. 

This new hope naturally infected the 
forty-three student planners at Yale, and 
throughout the fall they met in groups to 
determine what they would do about it. 
Many of the department's required 
courses were outmoded and dull, with a 
tendency to belabor worn-out theories. 

Weaver: the middle man is no man at all 
"We'd had enough of this theoretical 
bull shit," says second-year student Jim 
Hunter. "What we wanted was greater 
exposure to the actual methods and tools 
of professional planning." At the same 
time, members of the faculty (five full-
time professors and many New Haven 
planners who taught part-time) were de-
ciding that they, too, wanted a change; 
and by November teachers and students 
were meeting together informally, sharing 
their hopes and talking about how the de-
partment could be revitalized, and won-
dering what the new chairman would 
think. 

And at this point Christopher Tunnard 
returned to Yale from Australia, and took 
charge from Acting Chairman Harry 
Wexler, an associate professor. Tunnard 
is an internationally respected author and 
planning historian. He was delighted as he 
listened to the planner's ideas at a depart-
ment-wide meeting called by the students. 
Although Tunnard and Wexler both had 
reservations, it was decided at that meet-
ing in mid-December to try a new experi-
ment: to have the students and teachers 
together run the department. There would 
be no rules, and the meetings would not 
have a formal structure or "official" 
power. At this meeting the planners re-
dedicated themselves to the Black Work-
shop, through which the handful of black 
students at the School of Art and Archi-
tecture could offer their skills to New 
R aven's black community 

After Christmas vacation, the members 
of the standing committee, as it was 
called then, started to meet regularly. 
As a first step, they began to consider 
questions of the budget, admissions of 
new students and the curriculum; and they 
were confident that Howard Weaver, the 
new dean of the School of Art and 
Architecture (of which city planning is 
one department) would help them when 
he could. Tunnard met with Dean Weaver 
and told him that a student-faculty com-
mittee was operating with regard to ad-
missions in the department. Weaver said 
that this was unusual, and they should 
recognize this. He was, however, content 
to accept the existence of the group as long 
as responsibility for decisions rested in the 
"normal channels"-those being the chair-
man, Tunnard, and the admissions chair-
man, Ralph Tucker, himself a member of 
the new group. Weaver added that student 
involvement might even be a good thing, 
and agreed with Tunnard also that the 
priorities for admissions in the coming
