Notes on a New History 
by Robert Jay Lifton 
Is history a collection of facts? Or is it 
a sense of perspective? In the article that 
follows, Robert Jay Lifton, Professor of 
Psychiatry at Yale Medical School, opts 
strongly for the latter. He offers several 
arguments to support the theory that it is 
a different perspective on history-a 
"New History"-that is at the base of 
today's student movement. 

Robert Jay Lifton is the author of 
Death in Life: Survivors of Hiroshima, 
winner of the National Book Award. 

What is a New History? And why do 
the young seek one? I raise these 
questions to introduce the idea of a parti-
cular New History-Ours-and to suggest 
certain ways in which we can begin to 
understand it. 

. Let us define a New History as a radical 
and widely-shared regeneration of the 
forms of human culture-biological, ex-
periential, institutional, technological, 
esthetic and interpretive. The newness of 
these cultural forms derives not from their 
spontaneous generation, but from exten-
sions and transformations of what already 
exists; that which is most genuinely revo-
lutionary makes psychological use of the 
past for its plunge into the future. Of 
special importance is the reassertion of the 
symbolic sense of immortality which man 
requires as he struggles to perpetuate him-
self biologically and communally, through 
his works, in his tie to nature, and through 
transcendent forms of psychic experience. 

But the shapers of a New History-
political revolutionaries, revolutionary 
thinkers, extreme holocausts, and tech-
nological breakthrough-also express the 
death of the Old. This has been true of the 
American, French, Russian and Chinese 
revolutions; the ideas of Copernicus, 
Darwin and Freud; the mutilations of the 
two world wars; and, most pertinent to 
us, the technological revolution which 
produced Auschwitz and Hiroshima, as 
well as the post-modern automated and 
electronic society. Each of these has been 
associated with "the end of an era," with 
the devitalization, or symbolic death, of 
forms and images defining the world view 
and life-patterns of large numbers of 
people over long periods of time. 

Great events and new ideas can cause, 
reflect or symbolize historical shifts. The 
combination of Nazi genocide and the 
American atomic bombings of two J apa-
nese cities terminated man's sense of 
limits concerning his self-destructive 
potential, and thereby inaugurated an 
era in which he is devoid of assurance 
of living on eternally-as a species. It bas 
taken almost twenty-five years for formu-
lations of the significance of these events 
to begin to emerge-formulations which 
cannot be separated from the tecbnologi-
~al developments of this same quarter-
century, or from the increasing sense of a 
universal world-society that has accom-
panied them. 

The New History, then, is built upon 
the ultimate paradox of two competing 
and closely related images: that of the 
extinction of history by technology and 
that of man's evolving awareness of him-
self as a single species. It may be more 
correct to speak of just one image, extra-
ordinarily divided. And whatever the dif-
ficulties in evaluating the human conse-
quences of this image, psychologists and 
historians who ignore it cease to relate 
themselves to contemporary experience. 

The celebrated 1962 "Port Huron 
Statement" of the Students for a Demo-
cratic Society, which is still something of 
a manifesto for the American New Left, 
contains the assertion: "Our work is 
guided by the sense that we may be the 
last generation in the experiment with 
living." I think we should take this serious~ 
ly, just as many of us took seriously Albert 
Camus' declaration that, in contrast with 
every generation's tendency to see itself as 
"charged with remaking the world," his 
own had a task "perhaps even greater, for 
it consists in keeping the world from des-
troying itself. In seeking new beginnings 
men are now haunted by an image of the 
end of everything. 

Do the young feel this most strongly? 
They themselves often say just the op-
posite. When I discuss Hiroshima with 
students, they are likely to point to a dis-
parity between my (and Camus') specific 
concern about nuclear weapons and the 
feeling of their generation that these wea-
pons are just another among the horrors 
of the world bequeathed to them. Our two 
"histories" contrast significantly: my 
(over forty) generation's shocked "sur-
vival" of Hirsoshima and continuing 
need to differentiate the pre-Hiroshima 
world we knew from the world of nuclear 
weapons in which we now live; their 
(under twenty-five) generation's experi-
ence of growing up in a world in which 
nuclear weapons have always been part 
of the landscape. This gradual adapta-
tion, as opposed to original shock, is of 
great importance. Man is psychologically 
flexible enough to come to terms with al-
most anything, so long as it is presented 
to him as an ordained elem~nt of his 
environment. 

But such adaptation is achieved at a 
price, and achieved only partially at that. 
The inner knowledge on the part of the 
young that their world has always been 
capable of exterminating itself creates an 
undercurrent of anxiety against which 
they must constantly defend themselves-
anxiety related not so much to death itself 
as to a fundamental terror of premature 
death and unfulfilled life, and to high un-
certainty about all forms of human con-
tinuity. Their frequent insistence that 
nuclear weapons are "nothing special" is 
their form of emotional desensitization, 
or what I call psychic numbing (as op-
posed to other forms called forth by their 
elders). But the young must do a great 
deal of continuous psychological work to 
maintain their nuclear "cool." And this in 
turn may make them unusually responsive 
to possibilities of breaking out of such 
numbing and of altering the world which 
has imposed it upon them. 

All perceptions of threatening historical 
developments must occur through what 
Ernst Cassirer called the '.'symbolic net" 
-that special area of psychic-creation 
characteristic of man, the only creature 
who "instead of dealing with . .. things 
themselves ... constantly conserves ... 
with himself." In these internal (and often 
unconscious) dialogues, anxieties about 
technological annihilation merge with 
various perceptions of more symbolic 
forms of death. That is, Hiroshima and 
Auschwitz become inwardly associated 
with the worldwide sense of profound 
historical dislocation: with the disintegra-
tion of formerly vital and nourishing 
symbols resolving around family, religion, 
principles of community and the life cycle 
in general; and with the inability of the 
massive and impersonal post-modem in-
stitutions (of government, education and 
finance) to replace psychologically that 
which has been lost. They become asso-
ciated also Â·with the confusions of the 
knowledge-revolution, and the unpre-
cedented dissemination of half-knowledge 
through media whose psychological im-
pact has barely begun to be discerned. 

There is a very real sense in which the 
world itself has become a "total environ-
ment-it closed psychic chamber with 
continuous reverberations, bouncing 
about chaotically and dangerously. The 
symbolic death perceived then is this 
combination of formlessness and totality, 
of the inadequacy of existing forms and 
imprisonment within them. 

The young are struck by the fact that 
most of mankind simply goes about its 
business as if these extreme dislocations 
did not exist-as if there were no such 
thing as ultimate technological violence 
or existence rendered absurd. The war in 
Vietnam did not create these murderous 
incongruities, but it does epitomize them 
and it consumes the American youth in 
them. No wonder then that in their "con-
versations with themselves" so many of 
the young seem to be asking: How can we 
bring the world-and ourselves- back 
to life?

Students ot revolution and rebellion 
have recognized the close relationship of 
both to death symbolism and to visions of 
transcending death by achieving an 
eternal historical imprint. And Albert 
Camus describes insurrection, in its 
exalted and tragic forms, as "a prolonged 
protest against death, a violent accusation 
against the universal death, a violent ac-
cusation against the universal death 
penalty," and as "the desire for immortal-
ity and for clarity." But Camus also 
stressed the rebel's "appeal to the essence 
of being," his quest "not ... for life, but 
for reasons for living." And this brings us 
to an aU-important question concerning 
mental participation in revolution: what 
is the place of ideology, and of images and 
ideas, and of the self in relationship to all 
three? 

. Men have always pursued immortaliz-
ing visions. Most of the revolutionary 
ideologies of the past two centuries have 
provided elaborate blueprints for indi-
vidual and collective immortality-
specifications of ultimate cause and ulti-
mate effect, theological in tone and 
scientific in claim. When present-day revo-
lutionaries reject these Cartesian litanies 
they are taking seriously some of the im-
portant psychological and historical in-
sights of the last few decades. For they 
are rejecting an oppressive ideological 
totalism-with its demand for control of 
all communication within a milieu, its 
imposed guilt and cult of purity and con-
fession, its loading of the language and its 
principles of doctrine over person. This 
rejection, at its best, represents a quest by 
the young for a new kind of revolution-
one perhaps no less enduring in historical 
impact, but devoid of the claim to om-
niscience and of the catastrophic chain of 
human manipulations stemming from that 
claim. 

Possibly the anti-ideological stance of 
today's young will tum out to be a trans-
itory phenomenon, a version of the 
euphoric denial of dogma that so fre-
quently appears during the early moments 
of revolution, only to be overcome by 
absolutist doctrine and suffocating or-
ganization in the name of revolutionary 
discipline. Yet there is reason for be-
lieving that the present antipathy to ideol-
ogy is something more, that it is an expres-
sion of a powerful contemporary style. 
The shift we are witnessing from fixed, all-
encompassing forms of ideology to more 
fluid ideological fragments approaches 
Camus' inspiring vision of continuously 
de-congealing rebellion, as opposed to 
dogmatically congealed, ali-or-none revo-
lution. I would also see it as an expression 
of contemporary, or what I call "protean," 
psychological style-post-Freudian and 
post-modem, characterized by intermin-
able exploration and flux, and by relatively 
easy shifts in identification and belief. 

Protean man as rebel then seeks to remain 
open while in the midst of rebellion, 
to the extraordinarily rich, confusing, 
liberating and threatening array of con-
temporary historical possibilities. 

His specific talent for fluidity greatly 
enhances his tactical leverage. For in-
stance, Daniel Cohn-Bendit. the leader of 
the French student uprisings of May, 
1968, in an interesting dialogue with Jean-
Paul Sartre, insisted that the classical 
Marxist-Leninist principle of the om-
niscient revolutionary vanguard (the 
working class, as represented by the Com-
munist Party) be replaced with "a much 
simpler and more honorable one: the 
theory of an active minority acting, you 
might say, as a permanent ferment. push-
ing forward without trying to control 
events." Cohn-Bendit went on to charac-
terize this process as "uncontrollable 
spontaniety." He rejected as "the wrong 
\ 
6 I The New 1 ournall September 28, 1969 
solution" an alternate approach (urged 
upon him by many among the Old Left) 
of formulating an attainable program 
and drawing up realizable demands. In 
the same spirit are the warnings of Tom 
Hayden, a key figure in the American 
New Left, to his S.O.S. colleagues and 
followers, against "fixed leaders;" and his 
insistence upon "participatory demo-
cracy." So widespread has this approach 
been that the American New Left has 
been characterized as more a process than 
a program. 

I would suggest that the general princi-
ple of "uncontrollable spontaniety" rep-
resents a meeting-ground between tactic 
and deeper psychological inclination. The 
underlying inclination consists precisely 
of the protean style of multiple identifica-
tio..:'ls, shifting beliefs and constant search 
for new combinations. Whatever its pit-
falls, this style of revolutionary behavior 
is an attempt on the part of the young to 
mobilize the fluidity of the twentieth 
century as a weapon against what they 
perceive to be two kinds of stagnation: the 
old, unresponsive institutions (univers-
ities, governments, families) and newly-
emerging but fixed technological visions 
(people "programmed" by computers in 
a "technetronic society"). A central fea-
ture of this attempt is the stress upon the 
communal spirit and the creation of actual 
new communities. And here too we ob-
serve an alternation between conserva-
tive images of stable and intimate group 
ties and images of transforming society 
itself in order to make such ties more 
possible than is now the case. 

The process, and the underlying pyscho-
logical tendencies, moreover, seem to be 
universal. Observing the nearly simultane-
ous uprisings in America, France, Japan, 
Brazil, Germany, Italy, Mexico, South 
Africa, Czechoslovakia, Chile, Yugoslavia 
and Spain, one can view them all as parts 
of a large single tendency, occurring with-
in a single world-wide human and techni-
cal system. Here the planet's instant com-
munications network is of enormous im-
portance, as is the process of psychological 
contagion. One need not deny the great 
differences in, say, Czech students rebel-
ling against Stalinism, Spanish students 
against Falangism, and American, French 
and Italian students against the Vietnam 
War, the consumer society, and academic 
injustices, to recognize the striking congru-
ence in these rebellions. In every case the 
young seek active involvement in the insti-
tutional decisions governing their lives, 
new alternatives to consuming and being 
consumed, and liberated styles of individu-
al and community existence. Unspecific 
and ephemeral as these goals may seem, 
they are clearly expressions of a quest for 
historical rebirth, for re-attachment to the 
Great Chain of Being, for re-assert ion of 
symbolic immortality. 

The French example is again revealing 
(thought not unique), especially in its 
extraordinary flowering of graffiti. Here 
one must take note of the prominence of 
the genre-of the informal slogan-on-the-
wall virtually replacing formal revolution-
ary doctrine, no less than the content. But 
one is struck by the stress of many of the 
slogans, sometimes to the point of inten-
tional absurdity, upon enlarging the indi-
vidual life space, on saying yes to more 
and no to less. Characteristic were "Think 
of your desires as realities," "Prohibiting 
is forbidden" (a play on words in which 
the ubiquitous "Defense d'afficher" is 
converted to "Defense d'interdire"), and, 
of course, the two most famous: "lmag-
ination in power" and "Imagination is 
revolution." Sartre was referring to the 
overall spirit of these graffiti, but perhaps 
most to the revolutionary ~cts themselves, 
when he commented (in the same dia-
logue mentioned before) : "I would like 
to describe what you have done as ex-
tending the field of possibilities." 

Precisely such "extending of the fields 
of possibilities" is at the heart of the 
world-wide youth rebellion-for hippies 
no less than political radicals-and at the 
heart of the protean insistence upon con-
tinuous psychic re-creation of the self. 
Around this image of unlimited extension 
and perpetual re-creation, as projected 
into a dimly imagined future, the young 
seek to create a new mode of revolution-
ary immortality.

Of enormous importance for these re-
bellions is another basic component of 
the protean style, the spirit of mockery. 
While young rebels are by no means im-
mune from the most pedantic and humor-
less discourse, they come alive to others 
and themselves only when giving way to 
-or seizing upon-their very strong in-
clination toward mockery. The mocking 
political rebel merges with the hippie and 
with a variety of exponents of pop culture 
. to "put on"-that is mislead or deceive by 
ineans of some form of mockery or ab-
surdity-his uncomprehending cohorts, 
his elders, or anyone in authority. In 
dress, hair and general social and sexual 
style, the mocking rebel is not only 
"extending the field of possibilities," but 
making telling commentary-teasing, 
ironic, contemptuous--on the absurd 
folkways of "the others." The mockery 
can be gentle and even loving, or it can be 
bitter and provocative in the extreme.

There has been much discussion about 
young rebels' selection of the university 
as a primary target for recent upheavals. 
Many distinguished commentators (David 
Riesman, Christopher Lasch, Steven 
Spender, Herbert Marcuse, Lionel Trilling 
and Noam Chomsky, among others) have 
cautioned students about the dangers of 
confusing the vulnerable centers of learn-
ing they attack (and for periods of time 
"bring down,") with society at large. 
Spender put the matter eloquently when 
he said that, "however much the university 
needs a revolution, and the society needs 
a revolution, it would be disastrous ... 
not to keep the two revolutions apart." He 
went on to point out, as have others also, 
that the university is "an arsenal from 
which [student-rebels] can draw the arms 
from which they can change society"; and 
that, "To say, 'I won't have a university 
until society has a revolution' is as though 
Karl Marx were to say 'I won't go to the 
reading room of the British Museum until 
it has a revolution.' " Yet wise as these 
cautionary thoughts undoubtedly are, one 
also has to consider the ways in which the 
university's special symbolic significance 
makes it all too logical (if unfortunate) a 
target for would-be revolutionaries. 

What makes universities unique is the 
extent to which, within them, the prevail-
ing concepts of a society are at the same 
time presented, imposed, examined and 
criticized. The university is indeed a train-
ing ground for available occupational slots 
in society, as young rebels are quick to 
point out; it can at its worst approach a 
technical instrument in the hands of the 
military-industrial complex. But it can also 
be precisely the opposite, a training ground 
for und~rmining social institutions, as 
Spender suggests, and as the young rebels 
themselves attest by the extent to which 
they are campus products. In most cases 
the university is a great many things in 
between. It provides for students four 
years of crucial personal transition-a rite 
de passage from relatively unformed ado-
lescence to a relatively formed adulthood. 
And the fact that many are likely to move 
through continuing protean explorations 
during the post-university years renders 
especially important whatever initial adult 
"formation" the university makes possible. 
For these reasons, and because both groups 
are there, the university is the logical place 
for the rebeflious young to confront their 
ostensible mentors, and thereby both de-
fine themselves and make a statement 
about society at large. 

The statement they make bas to do not 
only with social inequities and outmoded 
institutions, but with the general historical 
dislocations of everyone. And in this sense 
the target of the young is not so much the 
university, or the older generation, as the 
continuing commitment of both to the dis-
credited past. But the university provides 
unique opportunities for the young to re-
verse the father-son mentorship-and, 
moreover, to do so in action. The reversal 
may be confused and temporary, with stu-
dent and teacher moving back and forth 
between leadership and followership, but 
in the process the young can assert their 
advanced position in the shaping of what is 
to come. Though the "generation gap" 
seems at times to be increasing beyond re-
demption, there is also a sense in which 
the gap narrows as the young engage their 
elders as they never have before, and the 
university becomes a place of unprece-
dented intellectual and emotional contact 
between the generations. And what hap-
pens at one university can be repeated, 
with many variations, at any other uni-
versity throughout the world. Universities 
everywhere share a central position in the 
susceptibility to new currents, and tend 
also to present students with very real 
grievances; the global communications 
network provides not only the necessary 
contagion but instant instruction in the art 
of university rebellion. Specific actions and 
reactions then give way to a general his-
torical process. 

We learn more about the university in 
the midst of militant social disorder by 
turning to the greatest of recent national 
upheavals, the Chinese Cultural Revolu-
tion. More than is generally realized, uni-
versities were the focus of much that took 
place during that extraordinary movement. 
Not only were they a major source of Red 
Guard activists but within them .a series of 
public denunciations of senior professors 
and administrators by students and young 
faculty members preceded-and in a sense 
set off-the Cultural Revolution as a whole. 
These denunciations originated at Peking 
University, which was the scene of many 
such upheavals both before the Cornmu-
nist victory in China and during the sub-
sequent campaigns of "thought reform" 
that have become a trademark of the 
Chinese Communist regime. The Cultural 
Revolution was the most extreme of these 
campaigns and contrasted with more re-
cent student rebellions elsewhere in one 
very important respect: the young were 
called forth by their elders (Mao and the 
Maoists) to fight the latter's old revolution-
ary battles, and to combat the newly 
threatening impurities associated with re-
visionism. But from the beginning there 
was probably a considerable amount of 
self-assertion and spontaniety among Red 
Guard leaders and followers. And over the 
course of the Cultural Revolution, over-
zealous Red Guard groups became more 
and more difficult for anyone to control,
