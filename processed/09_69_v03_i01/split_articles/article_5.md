especially as they split into contending factions~ 
each claiming to be the most authen-
tically revolutionary and Maoist. And dur-
ing the summer of 1968, reports of jousts, 
fights and pitched battles among them also 
taking place at Peking University, revealed 
how within two years that institution had 
shifted in its function from provider of the 
spark of the Cultural Revolution tore-
ceptacle for its ashes. Significantly, mem-
bers of the Red Guard were then demoted 
to the status of "intellectuals" whore-
quired the tutelage of workers and espe-
cially peasants (and the control of the 
Army). But Peking and other universities 
continued to preoccupy the regime as 
places in need of fundamental reform. 
Indeed the remolding of educational 
institutions bas been greatly stressed over 
the course of the Cultural Revolution. 
And the extraordinary step of closing all 
schools throughout China for more than a 
year was both a means of mobilizing stu-
dents for militant political struggles be-
yond the campuses and revamping (how-
ever chaotically) the nation's educational 
process. I have elsewhere described the 
Cultural Revolution as a quest for sym-
bolic immortality, a means of eternalizing 
Mao's revolutionary works in the face of 
his anticipated biological death and the 
feared "death of the revolution." The uni-
versity was perceived throughout as both 
an arena of fearful dangers (revisionist 
ideas), and as what might be called an im-
mortalizing agent (for the promulgation 
at the highest cultural levels of the most 
complete Maoist thought). 


In its own fashion, the Cultural Revolu-
tion was a response to the New History, 
which in China's case includes not only 
Russian and Eastern European revision-
ism but early manifestations of protean-
ism. Chinese universities, however, have 
been forced to flee from contemporary 
confusions into what is most simp I~ and 
pure in that country's Old Revolutionary 
History; this is in contrast to the more 
open-ended plunge into a threatening but 
more open-ended future being taken by 
universities throughout the rest of the 
world. Yet these issues are far from de-
cided. Universities everywhere, China in-
cluded, are likely to experience powerful 
pressures from the young for "restructur-
ing." While this hardly guarantees equiva-
lent restructuring of national govern-
ments, it may well be a prelude to funda-
mental changes in almost every aspect of 
human experience. 


One can hardly speak of definitive con-
clusions about something just beginning. 
Nor would I claim a position of omnisci-
ent detachment from the events of the 
New History-! have in no way been 
immune from the combinations of feelings 
about them I have described for my gen-
eration of Left-intellectuals, and have 
here and there contributed to dialogues 
on them. But having earlier in this essay 
affirmed the significance of the New 
History, I wish now to suggest some of its 
pitfalls and then, finally, present-day po-
tentialities for avoiding them. 


From the standpoint of the young, 
these pitfalls are related to what is best 
called romantic totalism. I refer to a post-
Cartesian absolutism, to a new quest for 
old feelings. Its controlling image, at 
whatever level of consciousness, is that 
of replacing history with experience. 
This is, to a considerable extent, the 
romanticism of the "youth movement." 
I have heard a number of thoughtful 
European-born intellectuals tell, with 
some anxiety, bow the tone and atmo-
sphere now emanating from young Amer-
ican rebels is reminiscent of that of the 
German youth movement of the late 
Weimar Republic (and the Hitler Youth 
into which it was so readily converted). 
What they find common to both is a cult 
of feeling and a disdain for restraint and 
reason. While. I would emphasize the 
difference between the two groups much 
more than any similarities, there is a cur-
rent in contemporary youth movements 
that is more Nietzschean than Marxist-
Leninist. It consists of aÂ·stress upon what 
I call experiential transcendence, upon 
the cultivation of states of feeling so in-
tense and so absorbing that time and death 
cease to exist. (Drugs are of great im-
portance here but only as part of a general 
quest.) The pattern becomes totalistic 
when it begins to tamper with history to 
the extent of victimizing opponents in 
order to reinforce these feelings; a danger 
signal is the absolute denial of the princi-
ple of historical continuity. 


The replacement of history with experi-
ence-with totally liberated feeling-is by 
no means a new idea and has long found 
expression in classical forms of mysticism 
and ecstasy. But it has reappeared with 
considerable force in the present-day 
drug revolution, and in the writings of a 
number of articulate contemporary 
spokesmen such as Norman 0. Brown. 
This general focus upon the transcendent 
psychic experience would seem to be re-
lated to impairments in other modes of 
symbolic immortality. That is, the modern 
decline of theological concepts of im-
mortality on the one hand and the threat 
posed by present weapons (nuclear, bac-
terial and chemical) to man's biological 
and cultural continuity on the other, have 
radically undermined symbolism of death 
and transcendence. In the absence of in-
tact images of biological and cultural im-
mortality, man's anxiety about both his 
death and his manner of life is profoundly 
intensified. One response to thiS anxiety, 
and simultaneous quest for new forms, is-
the unique contemporary blending of 
experiential transcendence with social and 
political revolution. 


We have already noted that political 
revolution has its own transformationist 
myth of making all things new. When this 
combines with the experiential myth (of 
eliminating time and death) two extreme 
positions can result. One of these is the 
condemnation and negation of an entire 
historical tradition: the attempt by some 
of the young to sever totally their relation-
ship to the West by means of an impossibly 
absolute identity replacement, whether the 
new identity is that of the Oriental mystic 
or that of the Asian or African victim of 
colonialism or slavery. And a second 
consequence of this dismissal of history 
can be the emergence of a single criterion 
of judgment: what feels revolutionary is 
good, what does not feel revolutionary is 
counterrevolutionary. 


A related equally romantic pitfall 
might be called "generational totalism." 
The problem is not so much the slogan, 
"Don't trust anyone over thirty," as the 
unconscious assumption that can be be-
hind it: that "youth power" knows no 
limits because youth equals immortality. 
To be sure, it is part of being young to 
believe that one will never die, that such 
things only happen to other people, old 
people. But this conviction ordinarily 
lives side-by-side with a realization-at 
first preconscious, but over the years in-
creasingly a matter of awareness-that life 
is, after all, finite. And a more symbolic 
sense of immortality, through works and 
connections outlasting one's individual 
life span, takes hold and permits one to 
depend a little less upon the fantasy that 
one will live forever. 


Under extreme historical conditions, 
however, certain groups-in this case, 
youth groups-feel the need to cling to the 
omnipotence provided by a more literal 
image of immortality, which they in tum 
contrast with the death-tainted lines of 
others. When this happens we encounter a 
version of the victimizing process: the 
young "victimize" the old (or older) by 
equating age with individual or historical 
"exhaustion" and death; and the "victim," 
under duress, may indeed feel himself to 
be "as if dead," and collude in his victim-
ization. Conversely, the older generation 
has its need to victimize, sometimes (but 
not always) in the form of counterattack, 
and may feel compelled to view every 
innovative action of the young as destruc-
tive or "deadly." Indeed the larger signi-
ficance and greatest potential danger of 
what we call the "generation gap" reside 
in these questions of broken historical 
connection and impaired sense of im-
mortality. 


The recent slogan of French students, 
"The young make love, the old make 
obscene gestures," is patronizing rather 
than totalistic, and its mocking blend of 
truth and absurdity permits a chuckle all 
around. But when the same students refer 
to older critics as "people who do not 
exist," or when young American radicals 
label everyone and everything either 
"relevant" ("revolutionary") or "irrele-
vant" ("counterrevolutionary") on the 
basis of whether or not the person, idea 
or event is consistent or inconsistent with 
their own point of view-then we are deal-
ing with something more potentially mal-
ignant, with the drawing of sharp lines 
between people and nonpeople. 


Perhaps the ultimate expression of 
generational totalism was that of an early 
group of Russian revolutionaries who ad-
vocated the suppression and even annihi-
lation of everyone over the age of twenty-
five because they were felt to be too con-
taminated with the Old History of that 
time to be able to absorb the correct prin-
ciples of the New. I have heard no recent 
political suggestions of this kind; but there 
have certainly been indications (aside 
from the Hollywood version of youth 
suppressing age in the film "Wild in the 
Streets") that young radicals at times 
have felt a similar impulse; and that some 
of their antagonists in the older genera-
tions have felt a related urge to eliminate 
or incarcerate everyone under twenty-five. 


I have stressed the promiscuous use of 
the word "relevant." Beyond its dictionary 
meanings, its Latin origin, relevare, to 
raise up, is suggestive of its current mean-
ing. What is considered relevant is that 
which "raises up" a particular version of 
the New History-whether that of the 
young rebels or of the slightly older tech-
nocrats (such as Zbigniew Brzezinski) 
who are also fond of the word. Corre-
spondingly, everything else must be "put 
down"-not only criticized and defeated 
but denied existence. 


Such existential negation is of course 
an old story: one need only recall 
Trotsky's famous reference to the "dust-
bin of history." But the young, paradoxi-
cally, call it forth in relation to the very 
images and fragments we spoke of before 
as protean alternatives to totalism. An 
example is the all-encompassing image of 
the Establishment: taken over from Bri-
tish rebels, it has come to mean everything 
from the American (or Russian, or just 
about any other) poltical and bureaucratic 
leadership, to American businessmen 
(from influencial tycoons to salaried 
executives to storekeepers), to university 
administrators (whether reactionary or 
liberal presidents or simple organization 
men), and even to many of the student 
and youth leaders who are themselves 
very much at odds with people in these 
other categories. And just as Establish-
ment becomes a devil-image, so do other 
terms-such as (in different ways) "con-
frontation" and "youth" -become god-
images. It is true that these god-images 
and devil-images can illuminate many 
situations, as did such analogous Old-
Left expressions as "the proletarian stand-
point," "the exploiting classes," and 
"bourgeois remnants," these last three 
in association with a more structured 
ideology. What is at issue, however, is 
the degree to which a particular image is 
given a transcendent status and is then 
uncritically applied to the most complex 
situations in a way that makes it the start 
and finish of any ethical judgment or 
conceptual analysis. 


This image-focused totalism enters 
into the ultimate romanticization, that of 
death and immortality. While the sense 
of immortality-of unending historical 
continuity-is central to ordinary psycho-
logical experience, romantic totalism 
tends to confuse death with immortality, 
and even to equate them. Here onere-
calls Robespierre's famous dictum, 
"Death is the beginning of immortality," 
which Hannah Arendt has called "the 
briefest and most grandiose definition . . . 
(of) the specifically modem emphasis on 
politics, evidenced in the revolutions." 
Robespierre's phrase still resonates for us, 
partly because it captures an elusive truth 
about individual death as a rite de passage 
for the community, a transition between 
a man's biological life and the continuing 
life of his works. But within the phrase 
there also lurks the romantic temptation to 
court death in the service of immortality-
to view dying, and in some cases even 
killing, as the only true avenues to 
immortality. 


The great majority of today's radical 
young embrace no such imagery-they 
are, in fact, intent upon exploring the full-
est possibilities of life. But some can at 
times be prone to a glorification of life-
and-death gestures and to aU-or-none 
"revolutionary tactics," even in petty dis-
putes hardly worthy of these cosmic 
images. In such situations their sense of 
mockery, and especially self-mockery, 
deserts them. For these and the related 
sense of absurdity can, at least at their 
most creative, deflate claims to omni-
science and provide a contemporary equiv-
alent to the classical mode of tragedy. Like 
tragedy, mockery conveys man's sense 
of limitation before death and before 
the natural universe, but it does so now in 
a world divested of more "straight" ways 
to cope with mortality. Those young rebels 
who reject this dimension and insist upon 
unwavering militant rectitude move to-
ward romanticized death and the more 
destructive quests for immortality. 


It is the very openness of the young 
that may help them to avoid definitive 
commitments to self-defeating patterns. 
They need not be bound by the excesses 
of either Cartesian rationalism or the con-
temporary cult of experience which feeds 
romantic totalism. Indeed, though the 
latter is a response to and ostensibly a 
replacement for the former, there is a 
sense in which both are one-dimensional 
mirror-images of each other. Today's 
young have available for their formula-
tions of self and world the great twentieth-
century insights which liberate man from 
the senseless exclusions of the opposition 
between emphasis on "experience" and on 
the "rational." I refer to the principles of 
symbolic thought, as expressed in the work 
of such people as Cassirer and Langer, 
and of Frued and Erikson. One can never 
know the exact effect of great insights 
upon the historical process, but it is quite 
possible that, with the decline of the total 
ideologies of the Old History, ideas as 
such will become more important than 
ever in the shaping of the New. Having 
available an unprecedented variety of 
ideas and images, the young are likely to 
attempt more than did previous genera-
tions and perhaps make more mistakes, 
but also to show greater capacity to extri-
cate themselves from a particular course 
and revise tactics, beliefs and styles-all 
in the service of contributing to embryonic 
social forms. 


These forms are likely to be highly fluid, 
but need not by any means consist exclu-
sively of shape-shifting. Rather, they can 
come to combine flux with elements of 
connectedness and consistency, and to do 
so in new ways and with new kinds of 
equilibria. Any New History worthy of 
that name not only pits itself against, but 
draws actively upon, the Old. Only 
through such continuity can the young 
bring a measure of sure-footedness to their 
continuous movement. And to draw upon 
the Old History means to look both ways: 
to deepen the collective awareness of 
Auschwitz and Hiroshima and what they 
signify, and at the same time to carve out 
a future that remains open rather than 
bound by absolute assumptions about a 
"technetronic society" or by equally ab-
solute polarities of "revolution" and 
"counterrevolution." 


It is possible (though hardly guaran-
teed) that man's two most desperately 
pressing problems-nuclear weapons and 
world population-may contribute to the 
overcoming of total ism and psychism. I 
have written elsewhere of the pattern of 
"nuclearism," the deification of nuclear 
weapons and a false dependency upon 
them for the attainment of political and 
social goals. This "nuclearism" tends to 
go hand-in-hand with a specific form of 
psych ism, the calling forth of various 
psychological and political constructs in 
order to deny the technological destruc-
tiveness of these weapons. Nuclear illu-
sions have been rampant in both America 
and China. There are impressive parallels 
between certain Pentagon nuclear policies 
(grotesquely expressed in the John Foster 
Dulles doctrine of "massive retaliation") 
on the one hand, and the joyous Chinese 
embrace of nuclear weapons as further 
confirmation of the Maoist view of world 
revolution on the other. Similarly, Penta-
gon (and early Herman Kahn) projec-
tions of the ease of recovery from nuclear 
attack-of what I have called the nuclear 
afterlife--bear some resemblance to the 
Maoist view of the weapons as not only 
"paper tigers" but even as a potential 
source of a more beautiful socialist order 
rising from the nuclear ashes. Now I 
think that young rebels, with their fre-
quent combination of ftexibility and in-
clusiveness, are capable of understanding 
these matters. They have yet to confront 
the issues fully, but have begun to show 
inclinations toward denouncing nuclear-
ism and nuclear psych ism as they occur 


not only in this country but among the 
other great powers. Insights about nuclear 
weapons are of the utmost importance to 
the younger generation-for preventing 
nuclear war and for creating social forms 
which take into account man's radically 
changed relationship to his world because 
of tlie potentially terminal revolution as-
sociated with these weapons. 


To the problem of world population, 
young rebels are capable of bringing a 
pragmatism which recognizes both the 
imperative of technical programs on be-
half of control and the bankruptcy of an 
exclusively technical approach. Looking 
once more at China, we find that a coun-
try with one of the world's greatest popu-
lation problems has approached the matter 
of control ambivalently and insufficiently 
-mainly because of a Maoist form of 
.psychism which insisted that there could 
never be too many workers in a truly 
socialist-revolutionary state. Yet this posi-
tion has been modified, and there is much 
to suggest that the inevitable Chinese con-
frontation with the actualities of popula-
tion has in itself been a factor in under-
mining more general (and widely 
disastrous) patterns of psychism. Young 
radicals elsewhere are capable of the same 
lessons-about population, about Maoist 
contradictions and post-Maoist possibil-
ities, and about psych ism per se. 


Are these not formidable problems for 
youngsters somewhere between their late 
teens and mid-twenties? They are indeed. 
As the young approach the ultimate dilem-
mas that so baffle their elders, they seem to 
be poised between the ignorance of in-
experience and the wisdom of a direct re-
lationship to the New History. Similarly, 
in terms of the life cycle, they bring both 
the dangers of zealous youthful self-sur-
render to forms they do not understand 
and the invigorating energy of those just 
discovering both self and history-energy 
so desperately needed for an historical 
foray into the unknown. 


As for the "older generation"-tbose 
middle-aged Left-intellectuals-the prob-
lem is a little different. For them (us) one 
of the great struggles is to retain (or 
achieve) protean openness to the possi-
bilities latent in the New History and to 
respond to that noble slogan of the 
F rench students, "Imagination in power." 
But at the same time this generation does 
well to be its age, to call upon the experi-
ence specific to the lives of those who com-
prise it. It must tread the tenuous path of 
neither feeding upon its formative sons 
nor rejecting their capacity for innovative 
historical imagination. This is much more 
difficult than it may seem, because it re-
quires that those now in their forties and 
fifties come to terms with the extremely 
painful history they have known, neither 
to deny that history nor to be blindly 
bound by it. However shunted aside by 
the young they may feel, there is special 
need for their own more seasoned, if now 
historically vulnerable, imaginations. 


For both young and old intellectuals-
together with society at large-are 
threatened by a violent reaction to the 
New History, by a restorationist impulse 
often centered in the lower middle classes 
but not confined to any class or country. 
This impulse includes an urge to eliminate 
troublesome young rebels along with 
their liberal-radical "fathers," and tore-
turn to a mythical past in which all was 
harmonious and no such disturbers of the 
historical peace existed. For what is too 
often forgotten by the educated of all 
ages, preoccupied as they are with their 
own historical dislocations, is the extent 
to which such dislocations in others pro-
duce the very opposite kind of ideological 
inclination-in this case a compensatory, 
strongly anti-protean embrace of the 
simple purities of the Old History-per-
sonal rectitude, law and order, rampant 
militarism, and narrow rationalism. 


If man is to be successful in creating the 
New History that he must create in order 
to have any history at all, then the forma-
tive fathers and sons I have spoken of 
must pool their resources and succeed to-
gether. Should this not happen, the failure 
too will be shared-whether in the form of 
stagnation and suffering or of shared 
annihilation. Like most other things in 
our world, the issue remains open. There is 
nothing absolute or inevitable about the 
New History-except perhaps the need 
to bring it into being. 9
