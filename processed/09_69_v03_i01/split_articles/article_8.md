DeLuca: fell with the Forum 
spring should be changed: admissions 
should be based on the applicant's quali-
fications alone, and more black students 
should be recruited and admitted to all 
the departments of the school. 

Here, the edges begin to curl. While the 
city planning department was taking a 
careful look at itself, it apparently had 
company; many of the planners began to 
worry that Yale was preparing to disman-
• tie the department. They were able to 
cite several reasons why this was more 
than simple paranoia. 

For one thing, there was uncertainty 
about how the department would be fit 
into the developing Social Science Center 
Yale's chief response to the crisis of the ' 
~ity. It was obvious that the University 
mtended to commit huge amounts of 
'f 
money to the Center, and was already in-
volved with plans for a monstrous new 
~uildin~ to house it. Secondly, and more 
tmmedtately, Associate Provost for Urban 
Studies and Programs Joel Fleishman was 
having amazing success in raising more 
than a million dollars in foundation grants 
for newly-created Yale urban programs. 
Not a penny went to the city planning 
department. ("Urban studies takes re-
sources out of the city and puts them into 
-
books," one student planner angrily com-
plained.) 

It was not hard for the planners to 
guess ~hy they were being slighted; any-
one w1th a passing interest in Yale ad-
ministrators' opinions on such matters 
had heard that they were displeased with 
the department's lack of national renown 
and, with the exception of Tunnard, big 
names to attract the attention of the press. 
If, as President Brewster told the alumni 
last year, "education has become good 
business," it might follow that bad press 
is bad education. 

Good or bad, the city planning de-
par~ment might reasonably have hoped 
for mcreased funds to make it better. But 
" 
when Dean Weaver met with the group 
~ to deny rumors that the department was 
on the way out, he found it hard to be con-
vincing and at the same time inform them 
tha! there would, yes, be slight cuts in 
thetr budget for hiring faculty members 
the next year. 

.. The man who really got us started on 
the whole thing was Pat Goeters," says 
second-year student Howard Brown. 
~oeters, a professional architect and ad-
JUnct professor in the city planning depart-
ment. "had for years been telling his 
Brewster: no sentimental egalitarian he 
students to take a good look at their own 
world before they were so eager to rush 
out and tamper with other peoples' lives. 
But before last year the students were 
mainly slide-rule engineers intent upon 
building bridges," Brown continued. 

"Suddenly, last year •. there were enough 
people who agreed on a few basic things. 
You can't believe how exciting it was 
sitting around that table. There was so 
much energy generated there-we just 
knew we were starting to do something, 
human beings together asking questions 
about how to take control of their lives. 
And we weren't talking about 'radical' 
ideas, except in the sense that they were 
democratic." 

One of the first things the department 
agreed on was to make an effort to enroll 
":'ore black and Spanish-speaking people, 
smce the work to be done in the ghettoes 
would have to involve largely non-white 
planners. With the expressed encourage-
ment of Dean Weaver, both the city plan-
ning department and the architecture de-
partment (their heads were going through 
similar changes) worked out an arrange-
ment with the Black Workshop, whose job 
it became to recruit black students from all 
over the country for admission into the two 
departments. (It has been a tradition at the 
art and architecture school that each de-
partment handles its own admissions and 
financial aid; this year, though, Dean 
Weaver was charged with arranging aid 
for the admitted students.) 

Since recruitment activities would take 
more time than usual, the city planners 
decided to divide admissions into two 
parts-normal acceptance letters to 
eighteen students, mostly white, by April 
I; subsequent letters to black applicants 
by May 1. 

On March 31, Dean Weaver informed 
Tunnard that university Provost Charles 
Taylor had just imposed a limit of 14 in-
coming students upon the department, 
based upon an overall enrollment of 
35 students. This reduction in numbers 
f~om previous years perplexed everyone, 
smce recent entering classes had numbered 
more than 20, and the current enrollment 
of the department ~as 43. The dean djd 
not give any reasons for this decision, ex-
cept to relay that fact that the department 
was currently "overenrolled." 

"It was like something out of Catch 22 " 
said one student. "Members of the forum' 
(which the group had by then named 
itself) would ask Weaver where be got 
the number thirty-five, and he wouJd say
