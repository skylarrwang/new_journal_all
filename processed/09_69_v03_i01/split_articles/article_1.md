Some may come and some may go; we shall surely pass. 

So they finally did it. And just when we 
were desperately groveling to muster up 
our last pathetic hopes that they wouldn't. 
But humans aren't like cows; when they 
are sucked on and sucked on they will 
not continue to give milk to a stainless 
steel calf. We .finally shrivelled as our 
last morsel of dread, the milk of human 
existentialism, escaped the atmosphere 
with the Apollo 11 this summer, and as 
a sapped nation tried with such mastur-
batory anxiety to excite jtself, it didn't 
for a moment realize that it was trying 
to celebrate its own death, drowned in a 
sea of homogenized boredom. 

The current college generation was 
suckled on Kennedy idealism and when 
the tit was ripped away so suddenly we 
precociously reached the confident pu-
berty of New Left radicalism. We thought 
we lost our virginity at the Pentagon when 
the blood flowed. But when it flowed 
again at Chicago we realized just how 
sick our elders were. Ah, Realization, 
you elusive goddess, what good are you? 
Their disease is contagious, so we lie 
here, Robin Hoods all, about to sink into 
our .final coma, when we dimly perceive 
that the leach attached to our arm is not 
ridding us of harmful humors but draw-
ing out our last drops of life. 

Death in life, yes, that is the stuff of 
our desperation. We are being technolo-
gized right out of life and are working so 
hard not to notice it; we are working so 
hard not to realize that our children may 
never have the chance to taste existence; 
the ship is sinking and all we do is gather 
on the bow to sing Londonderry Air. 

This summer I experimented with being 
apolitical. After deciding that the world 
was so far out of its mind there was no 
saving it, I thought if one could only 
shape his life into a healthy and happy 
existence, that would be an incredible 
accomplishment in itself. 

But the cruel war is still raging. Not 
to join one side is to join another. Amidst 
today's mess there are two SDS groups, 
both claiming to be the true SDS and both 
more intent on destroying each other 
than in fighting the evils that brought 
them into existence. 

We students gave up on the war in Viet-
nam because after a few earnest attempts 
it bored us. Ah me, what a luxury. And 
now we have to· dig into our guts to tran-
scend the numbing of the mass media and 
realize that,indeed, the war goes on. 

When a national party, the Black: 
Panthers, is being destroyed by ·political 
repression, this infighting among student 
activists is just so much childish snobbery. 

There are a whole lot of people who 
can't simply shave their beards, cut their 
hair, and apply to business school. 

I strongly hope that no occupation of 
any university building takes place this 
year. I hope no violent disruption of the 
University occurs. Liberal rhetoric aside, 
for all its faults and abuses, the university 
does exist as one of society's few critics, 
and before we give up on reason we had 
better damn well realize that in this coun-
try stupidity has the monopoly on power. 

If I were a CIA agent I would try to en-
courage the student left to take over a 
building, for the facists of the right are 
chomping at the bit-and their game is in 
quite a different league. Besides, from an 
esthetic view, occupying a building, after 
it has been done so many times in so 
many places, could exist only as a parody 
of itself. 

So what is the purpose of all this self-
righteous rambling? Well, when a few of 
us, who were deadened by the creative 
bankruptcy of the extracurricular monol-
liths at Yale, got together a couple years 
ago to start a new magazine, we wanted 
to succeed as writers, artists and thinkers. 
We were drowned in success so quickly 
we didn't realize we had lost sight of land. 
We became an established power around 
Yale so quickly, that we forgot that the 
very reason we came into existence was 
to constantly criticize power. Many of us 
were so flattered at the invitation of na-
tional magazines to write for them, that 
we unknowingly sacrificed not a little 
integrity in the process. It was a painful 
lesson, still embarrassing, but we have 
learned. 

We are starting off this year with an 
elated sense of purpose: to lend some 
meaning to the term Yale community. 
There will be no one New Journal view-
we hope to exist as a vehicle for any mem-
ber of the community to express an in-
telligent idea. 

If you have something to say, please get 
in touch. This year we are looking for 
hard-hitting reportage, thoughtful reviews 
of the arts and politics-as well as fiction, 
poetry, top photography and cartooning. 

While the vast majority of the magazine is 
free-lance contribution, if you would like 
to join a staff of people who like to edit as 
well as write, contribute artistically to a 
magazine that has won more national 
awards for graphic design than any other 
in its class, or run the business of the most 
widely read and controversial publication 
at Yale, please call us at any time. (We 
never have a competition, for we feel it 
cramps our anarchic style.) 

The very existence of this magazine 
expresses a basic affirmation of the need 
for intelligent discussion among the mem-
bers of this community. Our criticism, 
though strong, stems from the belief that 
it is the most positive contribution we 
can make at this time. Last year we 
wanted to be known as writers and artists. 
This year please call us anything but that-
like flies to wanton boys, you can kill us 
for your sport, but please don't then go 
and pin our wings to a display board. 

We may well fail but in such an existen-
tially draining world, even the thought 
of failure is invigorating.
