**Title: ART AND WORK IN AUVILLAR**

A group of thirteen students has gathered at an air-
port in Toulouse, France. We are en route to a small 
village called Auvillar for a month-long intensive stu-
dio art summer program led by the painter and Yale 
School of Art Professor Robert Reed ART ‘62. At 75, 
Reed is smaller and frailer than I had imagined, but 
he’s beaming. Most of us are meeting him for the ﬁrst 
time, yet he already knows our names. He speaks in a 
tender tone, as if catching up with a good friend he 
hasn’t seen in years, and listens attentively. It is early 
June of 2014, and the southern French countryside that 
ﬂies by the bus from Toulouse to Auvillar fulﬁlls every 
painterly cliché of itself—beautiful light, fragrant air, 
old stone houses dotting the river banks.


But there is little time to enjoy the scenery. Under 
the guidance of Reed and his four teaching fellows, we 
spend nearly all of the next four weeks drawing and 
painting our “investigations”—Reed’s term for the sub-
jects we have chosen to concentrate on for the course of 
the program. We begin with life drawings from objects 
we ﬁnd ourselves. A pile of bricks, a miniature forest of 
moss, twigs, and pebbles, and a whole artichoke all ﬁnd 
their way into the studio. The commitment is total; the 
work is personal and at times discomforting. Laptops, 
cell phones, headphones, and visitors are absolutely 
banned. On the third night, after two days of misguided 
attempts and Reed’s disapproval, I panick, realizing it 
wouldn’t be a leisurely summer session of plein air 
painting. To stop myself from running away, I drag my 
empty suitcase to the studio and start drawing it.


The works we create range from palm-sized to wall-
sized, from six pieces to over a hundred per student for 
each day’s review session, which Reed calls an “obser-
vation.” “Quantity is the direct result of the intensity 
of your search,” he often reminds us. The studio is in 
a constant ﬂurry of pieces of paper and cardboard that 
we ﬁll with charcoal and graphite in a matter of min-
utes. The physical motions we use to produce drawings 
become muscle memory.


Titled “Studio Practice in Painting and Drawing,” 
Reed’s course in Auvillar was the ﬁnal installment in a 
series of programs he created throughout his life. The 
program exempliﬁed his pedagogy: an isolated setting, 
unique vocabulary, and a dedicated group of students 
ready to form a tight-knit community. In 1960, as a stu-
dent at the Yale School of Art, Reed participated in the 
Yale Summer School of Music and Art in Norfolk, then 
taught by the famed artist Philip Guston. According to 
Reed’s wife, Susan Whetstone, the Norfolk experience 
was among his most formative. “Robert produced a lot 
of work as a painter, but he hoped his legacy would 
be primarily as a teacher. The programs [he designed] 
came out of his experience at Norfolk, which was very 
interdisciplinary, with musicians, painters, and other 
artists all working together. It was a total experience 
of being enmeshed in your work, your art, twenty-four
