sleepless four-day binge on speed and heroin, he says. His 
friend, a woman who has since died from an overdose, 
lured him into her car with drugs. She took him to the 
hospital where he protested for three hours in the parking 
lot, tearing her car apart and threatening to kill her if she 
made him go inside. She ﬁnally convinced him and, after 
doctors strapped him down, he woke up to his dad plead-
ing with him to go to Teen Challenge. “I’ll try,” he said, 
knowing that he had nothing to lose.


Like Springer, Barreto insists that addiction cannot be 
isolated to a single source. “We understand that it’s no 
longer just biological, just psychological, just sociologi-
cal,” he says. He acknowledges that not everyone who tries 
drugs becomes addicted. Teen Challenge does not wish to 
punish people addicted to drugs for their “injury,” as Bar-
reto calls it, but the approach does “use biblical principles 
to correct some of their character ﬂaws.” A person with 
an addiction is a slave to his own desires, contradicting 
the Apostle Paul, who taught, “I will be a slave to nothing 
except Christ,” explains Barreto.


Hoping to one day operate out of a safer location than 
the current outpost on Spring Street, the Connecticut 
branch of Teen Challenge is raising money by renovat-
ing condominiums it was gifted. The men in the house, 
alongside local church groups, provide the labor, and the 
leases or sales of the condos will provide funds for the 
organization. Barreto envisions a large house in the coun-
tryside, akin to something like the Turnbridge mansion.


When Karine Heard talks about her younger son, 
Brent, she still slips into present tense: “My son tells me,” 
or, “Brent likes…” She struggled with him constantly 
throughout his adolescence—from the age of 14, she says, 
he seemed stuck in a revolving door of addiction treat-
ment, homelessness, jail, even life support. His parents 
tried tough love, enabling, and everything inbetween. She 
left food for him in the outside fridge or drove him where 
he needed to go just to avoid giving him cash.


But there was only so much of Brent’s life that she 
could control. On April 12, 2016, shortly after he called his 
mother to ask for a piece of mail, he made another call, to 
his acquaintance Timothy Paprocki, to ask him for drugs. 
Later that day, Brent overdosed on fentanyl-laced heroin 
in Paprocki’s car in Groton. Paprocki didn’t call for help. 
Emergency Medical Services found Brent some time later 
and transported him to the hospital, where he was pro-
nounced dead upon arrival.


Heard got the call from the Lawrence + Memorial 
emergency room at 8:30 that night. She knew the number 
by heart. When the nurse on the phone asked Heard to 
come meet the doctor, Heard started screaming, “No! No! 
No!” The woman replied, “Please drive safely,” and Heard 
threw the phone across the ﬂoor.


Heard was sure that Brent was dead. “Karine, you don’t 
know that,” her husband reassured her. Maybe he’d had a 
heart attack, he said. Maybe he was okay. As they pulled 
up to the hospital, they passed an ambulance leaving. 
Then a police car and another ambulance and another 
police car. EMTs watched the parents walk in. The doctor 
looked at them in the hallway and said, “I’m so sorry.” She 
told them the story, but Heard already knew it.
