THE RIGHT TO BARGAIN
Where Local 33 ﬁts into the contentious history of labor organizing Yale
Amy Xu
As a light rain fell on New Haven, hundreds of teach-
ers, students, and labor organizers walked in silence down 
College Street. The April 25 march, which had the gravity of 
a funeral procession, began outside the Methodist Church 
across from Battell Chapel and ended at a white tent erected 
in front of Yale University President Peter Salovey’s house on 
Hillhouse Avenue. Rising to address the crowd on a makeshift 
stage, Maria Elena Durazo, the Democratic National Com-
mittee Vice Chair, drew parallels between graduate student 
teachers’ recent efforts to unionize and social justice move-
ments of the past. “It is always this way,” she said. “When you 
seek what you deserve, when you act to make your rights real, 
you’re ignored at ﬁrst.”
For months, Local 33, the Yale graduate student teach-
er’s union, had been calling upon the Yale administration 
to begin negotiating their ﬁrst contract, a legal agreement 
between the union and the University about working con-
ditions and employee beneﬁts. In February, when graduate 
student teachers voted to unionize on a department-by-de-
partment basis, the mood among Local 33 organizers had 
been jubilant. But Yale had repeatedly refused to ofﬁcially 
recognize the union, and by April, organizers decided it was 
time to raise the stakes.
Toward the end of her remarks, Durazo turned to the eight 
graduate student teachers gathered around her in a semicir-
cle. “Yale wants you to wait…and so you will wait, without 
eating. You will show Yale that you have power.” She pivoted 
back to the crowd and announced what they had all been 
waiting for: “Tonight, eight courageous members of Local 
33 begin a fast.”
Those eight members would subsist on water alone in 
“The Fast Against Slow,” an attempt to draw nationwide 
attention to their cause. If a faster’s health faltered, an allied 
graduate teacher would take her place—an indeﬁnite system 
of rotation. The fasters had deeply personal reasons for join-
ing the demonstration.  Julia Powers, a Comparative Liter-
ature graduate student teacher, told the crowd that she was 
“tired of widespread and unchecked sexual harassment at 
Yale.” Generations of “brilliant, talented women” — includ-
ing some of her acquaintances, Powers said — had their 
careers derailed because “men with long and well-known 
track records of harassment” oversaw their work. Tif Shen, 
a Mathematics graduate student teacher, said that when he 
reported an incident of assault and harassment in the work-
place, the administration ignored him. Emily Sessions, from 
the History of Art department, said that when she spoke up
