**Title: THE HUB OF THE WHEEL**
**Author: William Reid**
**Page number(s): 12**

Behind a warehouse door in East Rock, John Martin 
tightens a bolt and gives the crankshaft a turn, sending the 
rear wheel of the bicycle into a spin above the concrete 
ﬂoor. He leans in and eyes the rotation approvingly. It 
spins true—no horizontal shake, no friction. Behind him, 
Connor Dwyer Reynolds, the bike’s owner, breaks into a 
smile.

Before ﬁnding the Bradley Street Bicycle Cooperative, 
Dwyer Reynolds knew almost nothing about bike repair. 
But he needed a bike and wanted to build it himself, so 
Martin offered to teach him. Since they were about the 
same height, Martin repurposed a frame that once be-
longed to the second bike he ever built, back in college. 
It needed a complete overhaul—new brakes, wheels, and 
gears. Now, it works.

Surrounding them in the co-op, a diverse group of 
mechanics attends to bikes held aloft by aluminum bike 
stands. It’s a rare sight in a city segregated by race, class, 
and cultural capital. Graduate students work next to teen-
agers from Fair Haven. Older, upper-class men learn from 
young, working-class women. They clean chains, lube 
gears, replace brake pads, change tires, and adjust shifters. 
Outside on the sidewalk, someone test-rides a cleaned-up 
junker from the seventies. The brakes squeal. Some of the

mechanics have a background in professional bike repair, 
but most start like Dwyer Reynolds—they come in know-
ing nothing. Given time, space, tools, and a little instruc-
tion from Martin or the other experienced mechanics, 
they learn to salvage defunct bicycles.

The co-op takes in old bikes culled from dusty attics 
and garages or picked up by the New Haven Police De-
partment. Often, they’re dead on arrival—hardly func-
tional, if you can ride them at all. The bikes lean togeth-
er in long rows in a cavernous room at the back of the 
shop. One by one, these hunks of metal are resurrected 
by the co-op’s volunteer bike mavens. About half of the 
refurbished bikes will go to the beneﬁciaries of local char-
ities, such as Integrated Refugee and Immigrant Services 
(IRIS) and the Connecticut Mental Health Center. Last 
year, the co-op donated about a hundred recycled bikes. 
This year, it’s on track to double that.

With thick-rimmed glasses, light scruff, and a cyclist’s 
slight build, John Martin doesn’t exactly stand out among 
the other patrons on the shop ﬂoor. But he’s the man in 
charge here. He’s about six feet tall, thirty years old, and 
in two years, he’s made the co-op one of the strongest in-
stitutions in the New Haven biking community. In addi-
tion to the bike refurbishment program, the co-op hosts 
‘Chainbreakers,’ a bi-monthly night for female mechan-
ics, and group events like Bike Month, dedicated to cel-
ebrating bike culture and empowering cyclists across the 
city. The shop is also open to members who pay a small 
fee—$30 for three months—to work on their own bikes. 
Local bike activist Paul Hammer describes it as the com-
munity’s “cultural center.” And John Martin? “He’s the 
hub of the wheel.”

On some afternoons during the summer, Martin’s co-
op looked like a block party. Music ﬁltered out from the 
open warehouse door onto the sidewalk where mechanics 
worked and hung out. First-time customers whizzed up 
and down Bradley Street under Martin’s watchful eye, try-
ing out refurbished bikes.

All of this came about mostly by accident. In 2011, after 
a summer on his father’s farm in Westbrook, Connecti-
cut, Martin took a job at an architecture ﬁrm in Boston, 
where he’d gone to college. After a few years, he got a call 
from home. His father needed help—not on the farm, 
but at the warehouse that had been in Martin’s family for 
three generations. His grandfather purchased it in 1964,
