Under the high, Gothic Revival ceiling of the 
Sterling Memorial Library Lecture Hall, Chinese real 
estate mogul Zhang Xin speaks to a packed audience 
of students, professors, and university administrators on 
the afternoon of November 9, 2016. She is dressed in 
the stylish business attire that The New Yorker once 
called “a kind of Shanghai-Tang chic.” Before a large 
projector displaying photos of shiny ofﬁce buildings 
in Shanghai, she describes the newest projects of her

fund manager and friend of Zhang and her husband 
and business partner Pan Shiyi. The Chief of Staff of 
the SOHO Foundation passed Salovey a message: The 
couple was funding a ten million dollar scholarship 
for low-income Chinese students to study at American 
universities. Would Yale like to be a part of it?

The SOHO Foundation is part of an expanding net-
work of Chinese philanthropists interested in donating 
to American institutions of higher education. In the 
last ﬁve years, in addition to the ten million dollars 
from SOHO, Yale has received a gift of 8.9 million dol-
lars from Lei (who currently serves as a board member
