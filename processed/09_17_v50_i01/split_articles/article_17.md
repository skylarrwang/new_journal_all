about working conditions in her department, she was called a 
liar, threatened, and told to “shut up.”

“Fixing this takes will, not time, and I’m tired of being 
powerless while Yale blossoms,” Sessions told the crowd. 
“Yale has to respect us and listen to us, not wait longer. But 
Yale has told us to wait, so I am waiting, without eating.”


The sudden visibility of Local 33’s efforts this past spring 
took many undergraduates by surprise. Most weren’t entirely 
sure of what to make of “33 Wall Street,” a 25-foot bowshed 
that members of Local 33 erected on Beinecke Plaza the 
morning after the Hillhouse Avenue march. The plastic-and-
wood shelter stood for four weeks, staffed by round-the-clock 
shifts of supporters who gathered at picnic tables and under 
strings of lights. The encampment was impossible to miss and 
prompted passersby to confront the University’s relationship 
to labor—something many had never done before.

But despite the seeming novelty of the demonstration, 
Local 33’s actions ﬁt into a narrative of union organizing that 
is integral to the last half-century of Yale’s history. By the 
mid-nineteen-eighties, Yale’s clerical and technical workers 
had formed Local 34, and its dining hall, custodial, and main-
tenance workers, who began organizing in the nineteen-thir-
ties, had formed Local 35. Both unions currently exist under 
the international labor union UNITE HERE, which rep-
resents thousands of workers across North America, from 
hotel employees to railroad dining car workers. Motivated by 
rising job insecurity and the increasing cost of living in New 
Haven, graduate student teachers also started organizing in 
the late ninteen-eighties, ﬁrst through a group called T.A. 
Solidarity, which later became the Graduate Employees and 
Students Organization (GESO) and, as of last year, Local 33. 
As each iteration of the group emerged, the Yale adminis-
tration fought back, repeatedly thwarting their attempts to 
unionize.

For the past three decades, the conﬂict between graduate 
student teachers and the University has centered on one cen-
tral distinction: Are they employees, deserving of beneﬁts sim-
ilar to University professors? Or are they students, bestowed 
with University resources like undergrads, and tasked with 
extra responsibilities that reﬂect their academic training?

The graduate student teachers who began early organiz-
ing efforts in the late nineteen-eighties were ﬁghting for not 
just for certain workplace conditions and beneﬁts, but for a 
speciﬁc ideological framework: we are students and employ-
ees. It was an issue that had never come up for Yale’s dining 
hall or clerical workers, who were undoubtedly University 
employees.

Doctoral students at Yale receive a full tuition waiver 
for ﬁve years of study, as well as teaching stipends, which 
vary from student to student. But for many graduate student 
teachers, that stipend, which is $30,250 a year at minimum 
— more than seven thousand dollars less than New Haven’s 
median household income — is not an adequate living wage.

For decades, the Yale administration has cleaved to one 
position: graduate student teachers are students, ﬁrst and fore-
most. In the late nineteen-eighties and early nineteen-ninties, 
Yale administrators were frequently quoted in the national 
media arguing that pro-union graduate student teachers had 
misunderstood their role at the University. “Forming a union 
represents an incorrect understanding of what teaching 
assignments for graduate students really are,” Donald Kagan, 
then-dean of Yale College, told The New York Times in 1991. 
“They were never intended to be jobs, but rather to be teach-
ing apprenticeships.”

Michael Denning, a professor of American Studies who 
has been involved with unionization efforts since he was a 
graduate student teacher at Yale, has never thought much of 
this line of argument. “If these were really students,” he said, 
“why would [the University] give them grants? It’s because 
they’re not students. The whole issue of the tuition waiver, 
to me, has always been an indication that they aren’t really 
students…That’s just a pure ideological illusion.”

After years of demonstrations and debates that resulted in 
minimal progress, the graduate student teachers’ labor move-
ment gained sudden momentum in August 2016, when the 
National Labor Relations Board ruled in favor of Columbia 
University’s graduate student teachers. The decision deemed 
them not only students but also employees entitled to collec-
tive bargaining rights under federal law. It provided the legal 
precedent for the battle that Yale’s graduate student teachers 
had been ﬁghting for the past 25 years.

But for Yale administrators, the ruling was not the ﬁnal 
word. Shortly after the February elections, lawyers working 


Over the past three decades, Yale and its unions have 
maintained a fragile, often acrimonious, relationship. In a 
March 2003 article in The New York Times, Steven Green-
house, a labor journalist, called it “unusually rancorous.” 
Until 2003, strikes and walkouts occurred almost every three 
years, as each contract developed through bitter negotiations.

Janet Lindner, Yale’s vice president for human resources 
and administration, wrote in an email this summer that since 
2003, there has been “a generation of strong partnerships 
based on the hard work of union and management lead-
ership.” Union leaders and University administrators have 
collaborated on goals and worked toward a sense of mutual 
trust, she said, adding, “Many employees at Yale now have 
never experienced a strike, and that gives me great hope for 
the future.”

But this past spring, Local 33’s demonstrations seemed to 
belie any indication that the University and its unions were 
on good terms. At best, the protests recalled the bitter labor 
conﬂicts that have deﬁned the University’s past.

“What is Yale afraid of?” members of Local 33 asked at ral-
lies, just as in September 1984, Local 34 strikers demanded, 
“Why should the Yale administration hide from the truth?”

The striking clerical and technical workers were in the 
midst of their ﬁrst contract negotiations in the fall of 1984. 
They called for salary increases, expanded beneﬁts, and job 
security over the next three years. Dining halls closed as their 
workers, members of Local 35, joined the picket lines. Local 
34 accused the University of discrimination on the basis of 
both race and gender; the union primarily consisted of the 
female support staff that populated the University’s reception 
rooms and front desks.

The strike ended after ten weeks, although protests and 
demonstrations continued through the winter. When the 
University and the union ﬁnally struck a deal in January, 
Local 34’s victory was apparent. But it came with a price: a 
semester’s worth of lost wages and job uncertainty. 
During the strike, there was an abiding sense among union 
members that Yale didn’t treat its workers with respect, said 
John Wilkenson, who was the secretary of the University at 
the time. “You shouldn’t tighten your belt in a way that will 
discourage or demoralize your employees, because it comes 
back and bites you,” he reﬂected. “You lose in the long run.”

When labor disputes dominated campus, undergrads were 
forced to reckon with their own dilemmas, both moral and 
practical, in ways that are unfamiliar to the vast majority of 
students today.  Do I cross a picket line, or do I skip my class? 
Do I work my student job, or do I refuse in solidarity with the 
striking workers?

Despite the outpouring of public support in 1984, student 
opinion was split. A Yale Daily News poll taken soon after 
the strike began found that twenty-one percent of students 
supported the University, thirty-ﬁve percent of students sup-
ported Local 34, and thirty-nine percent disagreed with both 
sides. Of those who disagreed with both sides, one third chose 
the option, “I care but I’m confused.”


Still, with its 80 percent female membership, Local 34 
expanded people’s understanding of what a union mem-
ber could look like and what unionization could achieve. 
Soon, graduate student teachers began to deﬁne themselves 
as workers with rights. The conceptual gap between an aca-
demic worker and an clerical worker was far narrower than 
the gap between an academic worker and, say, a factory 
worker. Additionally, many graduate student teachers were 
married to members of Local 34, exposing them to regular 
union activity, Wilkenson said. 

Practical concerns accompanied conceptual ones. In the 
nineteen-eighties, the teaching demands placed on graduate 
student teachers were growing increasingly intense. Gradu-
ate student teachers were asked to spend more time teaching 
undergrads than ever before. Financial strains were mount-
ing: by the end of the decade, a graduate student teacher’s 
teaching salary was many thousand dollars less than the cost 
of living in New Haven.

In 1987, a group of graduate student teachers calling them-
selves “T.A. Solidarity” — the precursor to GESO and Local 
33 — held its ﬁrst ofﬁcial meeting to discuss formal recourse 
for improving their working conditions. The organizers grap-
pled with how to deﬁne their new group in relation to the 
unions that already existed on campus. As graduate student 
teacher Christopher Lowe jotted down on a legal pad during 
an early meeting, how could they maintain their autonomy as 
a graduate student teachers’ “advocacy group” while avoiding 
becoming a “union support group”? On the other hand, how 
could they learn from “the experience of the unions… about 
how Yale might behave?” As the graduate student teachers 
broached the question of tactics — to strike or not to strike? 
to withhold grades or to give everyone an “A”? — they bal-
anced their own interests against public opinion and their 
allies’ positions. Lowe believed that a close alliance with the 
unions would help further both causes, and it was the posi-
tion that the group’s organizers ultimately adopted.

WHEN LABOR DISPUTES 
DOMINATED CAMPUS, 
UNDERGRADS WERE FORCED 
TO RECKON WITH THEIR OWN 
DILEMMAS, BOTH MORAL AND 
PRACTICAL, IN WAYS THAT 
ARE UNFAMILIAR TO THE VAST 
MAJORITY OF STUDENTS TODAY.  

T.A. Solidarity’s evolution into GESO in 1990 marked 
the graduate student teachers’ ﬁrst distinctive move toward 
a union-style advocacy group. Like a union, GESO went on 
strikes, petitioned the NLRB, and organized across depart-
ments. And in March 2016, GESO rebranded itself as “Local 
33,” clearly signaling its allegiance to the union model.

But the legal argument against graduate student teachers 
as workers held strong, as it had for years. Since 1970, cases 
regarding graduate teacher unionization at private universi-
ties had ﬂooded the courts. In 1972, a ruling involving Adel-
phi University determined that graduate student teachers 
were “primarily” students, not employees. The pendulum 
swung back and forth over the next few decades, as decisions 
were reversed and reinstated, deﬁning and redeﬁning the 
nature of graduate student teacher work.


With the Columbia University decision in 2016, the NLRB 
set a new precedent, arguing that graduate student teachers 
are legal employees. Local 33 organizers wasted little time to 
catch the momentum of fresh empowerment and launched 
into a new strategy for negotiating with the University: they 
would organize department by department. 

This strategy would secure collective bargaining units 
through individual departments — English, Geology and 
Geophysics, History, History of Art, Math, and Sociology — 
rather than through an all-department vote. Each of those six 
departments that voted to unionize would draw up a separate 
contract with the University. It was a tactic that ultimately 
included only a small proportion of the overall graduate stu-
dent teacher body. But from Local 33’s perspective, they had 
achieved their union; they were NLRB-certiﬁed.

“The logic of it makes sense, because people are doing very 
speciﬁc kinds of labors in very particular units,” said Jennifer 
Klein, a professor of labor history at Yale who supports and 
works with Local 33. “[White collar unions] are organizing 
through a different form of unionism than industrial union-
ism.” This “micro-bargaining” strategy made sense for Local 
33 because of the highly-specialized nature of graduate-level 
work, she said, and because it was a more feasible organizing 
strategy for a place like Yale, where organizers expected con-
siderable pushback.

There was also some precedent for Local 33’s micro-bar-
gaining tactic. In a 1996 academic journal article on the his-
tory of unionization at Yale, John Wilhelm, then-president of 
UNITE HERE, wrote that in the 1930s and 1940s, the custo-
dial, maintenance, and dining hall workers organized “incre-
mentally,” group-by-group, before banding into one union, 
Local 35. Their unionization process took over a decade.

But the University declined Local 33’s invitation to begin 
collective bargaining in eight departments. “Yale respectfully 
notes that this request is premature because the legal ques-
tions raised by Local 33’s unprecedented ‘micro-unit’ strat-
egy remain unanswered,” an April 11 statement read. “Yale is 
still engaged with Local 33 before the NLRB.  The university 
respects the legal process for resolving labor issues while this 
case continues to move forward.”

Many students also questioned the validity of Local 33’s 
methods. Stephen Krastanov, a graduate student teacher in 
Physics involved with GASO, a group of graduate students 
teachers opposed to Local 33, said that for him, the union, 
not the University, was bargaining in bad faith. “They are 
waiting for a union before they start thinking about how they 
will be using that union,” he said. Krastanov also believes 
that Local 33 also has a tendency to misrepresent facts: “They 
are setting up the University to look bad without honestly 
trying to negotiate with them.”

As 33 Wall Street stood on Beineicke Plaza, conversations 
on Cross Campus and in the comment threads of the “Over-
heard at Yale” Facebook page revealed the ambivalence over 
Local 33’s tactics that pervaded the student body. Why was 
so much of the graduate student teacher body excluded from 
the vote, as the University claimed? Were the elections really 
democratic?

This spring wasn’t the ﬁrst time Local 33 had come under 
ﬁre from the University community for its organizing tactics. 
On January 15, 2016, a group of “women, LGBTQ graduate 
students, and graduate students of color” penned an open let-
ter to the leadership of GESO, which would become Local 
33 two months later. “Tactics targeting students outside of 
their classrooms, in their ofﬁces, their apartments and dorm 
rooms are invasive regardless of how we move through the 
university,” wrote the undersigners, many of them union 
members and organizers who “write with a shared recogni-
tion of the powerful work this union has done over the last 
two decades to support marginalized university employees 
and New Haven residents.”

Over the past year, Local 33 has tried to improve upon 
the tactics described in that letter. “We make mistakes, but 
we also do the very best we can,” said Julia Powers, one of 
the ﬁrst fasting graduate student teachers, in a phone call 
over the summer. Melis Laebens, another graduate student 
teacher, said that although Local 33 is not perfect, she’s been 
“mostly sympathetic” to their position in the past year. “I have 
had personal tensions with my organizers at some points, and 
got angered a couple of times, but I have currently found 
my organizers are willing to listen and accommodate.” Her 
support, however, is “not unconditional.”

The University’s own delay tactics are similarly contested. 
Union detractors, including a sizeable portion of graduate 
student teachers, say Yale is a working within the bounds of 
the law; union supporters, including thirteen members of the
