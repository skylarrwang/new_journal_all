EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Behind the parking lot of Career High School, underneath 
a tree toward the back of a small plot of cultivated land, ﬁf-
teen people are seated in a circle, their eyes shut. A car drives 
by; occasionally, voices drift over from the street. A woman, 
alternating between English and Spanish, leads the group in 
a guided meditation, drawing its attention to different aspects 
of the surroundings. Past the circle of chairs, there are rows 
of lettuces, cucumbers, carrots, trellised tomatoes, and piles 
of fresh soil. This is the Hill North Farm, which New Haven 
Farms opened this past May.


New Haven Farms is a nonproﬁt started in 2012 to improve 
community health through urban agriculture. Hill North 
Farm is the organization’s eighth urban farm, but their ﬁrst in 
the Hill, one of New Haven’s lower-income neighborhoods. 
Currently, they’re running a free, twelve-week bilingual 
wellness program focused on preventing diabetes and other 
diet-related chronic diseases. The program follows a national 
curriculum created by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, but with a farm-based focus.


Following meditation, the ﬁfteen people present will 
spend a half hour working on the farm, harvesting the food 
that they’ll later take home. The bulk of the program, how-
ever, consists of a class led by Celin Garcia, a bilingual nutri-
tionist.


Garcia begins by checking on each participant’s prog-
ress. Many seem hesitant to share. “I’m doing good,” a man 
dressed in all blue murmurs, nodding.


A woman smiles shyly. In Spanish, she reveals that in the 
eight weeks since the program started, she’s been exercising 
daily and feeling healthy. Just a few days before, she went off 
her diabetes medication entirely. The group applauds.


“Well, I spent Saturday and Sunday in the hospital,” offers 
an elderly woman, gripping a cane. “But I feel better today. 
And I’ve come up with a great recipe for chicken and brown 
rice soup.” 


Participants are referred to the Hill North program by 
their healthcare providers. 


In order to qualify, they must have one risk factor—such 
as obesity, high cholesterol, pre-diabetes, or elevated blood 
sugar—and their income must fall below twice the poverty 
line. Beyond that, there is also a certain amount of self-se-
lection: it’s up to the patients to ﬁnd time in their schedules 
and come each week.


“It would be a lot easier to just go buy a sandwich,” a man 
said to me after the program. “But I’m here, and as long as 
I’m here, I’m gonna try 
to put healthy food in my 
body.”


Comprised 
primarily 
of 
African-American 
and 
Latino families, the Hill is 
cut off from the rest of New 
Haven by the Oak Street Connector, a one-mile segment of 
Route 34 built in the nineteen-sixties era of urban renewal. 
This barrier has had countless damaging effects on the neigh-
borhood over the years including, crucially, a lack of access 
to healthy food.


Large grocery stores are non-existent in the Hill. There are 
lots of corner stores and bodegas, which sell almost exclu-
sively processed foods: chips, candy, soda. For many, fresh 
and healthy food is far away; in 2015, the Community Alli-
ance for Research and Engagement completed a survey on 
health in New Haven, and reported that 35 percent of resi-
dents in low-income neighborhoods and 50 percent of His-
panic and Latino residents had experienced food insecurity 
in the past year.


New Haven Farms seeks to increase access to food for and 
improve the health of the Hill’s poorer residents. Liz Marsh, 
Program Director at the Hill North Farm, emphasizes that 
education cannot stand alone. “Yes, you can tell people that 
they need to eat healthy,” she says. “But if you don’t give 
them food or provide ways for them to grow or obtain their 
own food, then they’re not going to be able to be healthier.”


The farm’s focus isn’t limited to providing resources. “Cul-
ture is the biggest inﬂuence on people’s eating habits, and 
you learn eating habits from a really young age,” says Marsh. 
“And so, if you’re going to talk about food and changing your 
habits, you have to talk about culture.”


Participants often describe the struggle of integrating 
healthy food habits into their own food customs. “My whole 
life, I’ve gone to the grocery store and bought a twenty-pound 
bag of rice to make rice and beans,” one woman says, and oth-
ers nod. “But I’m trying to ﬁnd other ways to feed my kids.”


Across the street from the Hill North Farm is the Hill North 
Community Garden, which is run by the New Haven Land 
Trust in partnership with the Connecticut Mental Health 
Clinic. The garden stands at the corner of Sylvan Avenue 
and Asylum Street; 
spaced 
throughout 
it are raised beds 
ﬁlled with ripening 
produce, hoses con-
necting one to the 
next. It is a picture of 
what the Hill North Farm could be, in time. Geanine Peck, 
the clinic’s Associate Director of Acute Services, started the 
garden four years ago with the purpose of creating a public 
greenspace for the clinic’s patients in addition to the greater 
community.


The garden is always open, and visitors can take as much 
food as they like. Community members speciﬁcally requested 
many of the crops now growing in the garden, including cab-
bages, pumpkins, gandules (a type of legume, often served 
with rice in Puerto Rican cuisine), and collard and mustard 
greens.


Since the garden’s creation, Peck has started several differ-
ent programs for CMHC’s patients, and has run workshops 
for the larger community about growing and preparing food. 
“When 
we 
ﬁrst started, peo-
ple would come 
here 
pull 
entire plants out 
of the beds, or 
they’d take food long before it was ripe,” Peck says, leading 
me through the garden. “Food insecurity around here is so 
extreme. People were afraid there wouldn’t be anything left 
for them if they waited for the food to ripen.” 


In future years, graduates of the Hill North program will 
have the option to grow food in their own garden plots, using 
the skills that they learned during the program. New Haven 
Farms will provide each with a 4’ by 8’ plant bed, along with 
compost, seeds, seedlings, and a water source. They’ll have 
free reign to grow whatever they like.


As we leave the community garden, a man leaves his plot 
to introduce himself to me. “I live across the street, and I 
watch over this place,” he says. “Yeah—I guess you could say 
it’s sort of ours now.”
