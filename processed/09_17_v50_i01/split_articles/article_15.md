and both grandfather and father used the 
space as the headquarters for their New 
Haven–based electrical business. Since 
his father’s retirement, the warehouse had 
ﬁlled with decades of detritus.
By 2014, the warehouse was costing more than his fa-
ther could pay, so Martin moved back to New Haven to 
do something with the space—either clean it up enough 
to rent it out or start a small business of his own. It felt like 
the right time: He’d reached a plateau at work and recent-
ly gone through a tough breakup. He needed a change. 
And besides, he’d never turned down his father before.
 “I spent the ﬁrst six months just, like, cleaning,” Mar-
tin tells me as we stand in the warehouse. “Trips to the 
scrapyard, dumpster loads, a ton of recycling, selling stuff 
on eBay, reorganizing, consolidating. And we’re not done, 
you can see. There’s still a lot of stuff in there.” Only a few 
shelves have been reclaimed for the co-op’s tools; many 
still hold brightly colored bins ﬁlled with wires, switches, 
fuses, and everything else needed to keep the lights on. 
While cleaning up the warehouse, Martin started ﬁxing 
friends’ bikes on the side, a skill he’d picked up in Boston. 
At one point, he thought: Why not let other people use the 
space to do the same? A proper bike shop felt outside his 
ken, but maybe something less proﬁt-oriented and more 
community-focused would suit him. “It wasn’t a business 
idea,” he explains. “It was just a cool side project. But very 
quickly, it was, ‘Let’s take this and run with it.’” 
One day before the shop ﬁrst started up, Martin heard 
a knock at the door. He opened it to ﬁnd Joel LaChance, 
a New Haven resident who’d been riding and ﬁxing bikes 
in the city for forty years. LaChance had heard about the 
co-op through his insurance agent, whom Martin had 
contacted about purchasing coverage. A professional me-chanic and former bike-shop owner himself, LaChance 
sought Martin out with the hope of giving him some guid-
ance. New Haven has had various bike repair co-ops in 
the past, LaChance tells me. Most were funded through 
Dwight Hall at Yale. But the initiatives suffered from 
high turnover rates—student volunteers would graduate 
and move on without ﬁnding replacements. The Bradley 
Street Co-Op promised to be a more permanent ﬁxture of 
the biking community. “There’s a need for affordable bike 
repair in New Haven,” LaChance says.
So he found Martin, and a friendship quickly blos-
somed. LaChance introduced Martin to Paul Hammer. 
Together, the three founded BEEEP!, or Bicycle En-
trepreneurship, Education and Enrichment Programs, 
which launched the bicycle refurbishment initiative. 
The co-op has since absorbed BEEEP!, taking over the 
recycling program and its broader nonproﬁt mission: get-
ting more people onto bikes in New Haven.


“Transportation is a civil rights issue,” Mayor Toni 
Harp announced at a public meeting in January 2014. 
“It’s an economic development issue. It’s a jobs issue.” 
The data agrees. A report produced by DataHaven that 
same year notes that “transportation is by far the most 
commonly reported barrier to getting a job.” Part of the 
problem is what the report calls “job-sprawl”: low-wage 
jobs gradually leaving downtown, which is fairly well-ser-
viced by public transportation, and moving to wealthier 
suburbs like Hamden, which are public transportation 
dead zones. Over the last three decades, the proportion 
of residents in New Haven’s poorer neighborhoods—Fair 
Haven, Newhallville, and the Hill—who work outside of 
the city has nearly doubled, from 29 percent to 55 percent. 
What’s more, due to the racial makeup of these neighbor-
hoods, the “spatial mismatch” between housing and jobs 
is particularly pronounced among workers of color. 
That’s where bikes come in. The 2014 report found that 
in New Haven, more low-wage positions are accessible via

bicycle than by public transportation. And compared to 
cars, bikes are much cheaper to purchase and maintain, 
especially if owners can do it themselves at a place like 
the co-op. According to the American Automobile Associ-
ation, owning even a modest car costs, on average, seven 
thousand dollars a year. At the co-op, by contrast, you can 
purchase a used bike for a few hundred bucks.  
Martin isn’t just selling bikes, though. He wants to 
teach people skills that they continue to use. “I think any-
one who put the time in could become a pseudo bike-me-
chanic in a year. Which is pretty friggin’ awesome,” Mar-
tin tells me. He cites story after story of volunteers who, 
after working in the co-op, became so adept they could 
have gotten a job in a professional shop. Martin doesn’t 
claim any responsibility for their transformation. Rather, 
it’s about having the opportunity and resources to work on 
a range of different bikes. 
That egalitarian vision breeds the co-op’s inclusivity. 
On one summer afternoon, the oldest mechanic was an 
immigrant from Mexico in his sixties. He can’t always pay 
the shop fee in cash, so instead, he brings new rags and 
WD-40 to replenish its supplies. The youngest mechanic 
was thirteen. I ﬁrst met him after he ﬂipped over the han-
dlebars of his street bike onto the sidewalk in front of the 
co-op while trying to clear a jump made of two-by-fours. 
Since then, he’s taken to less death-defying pursuits: He 
volunteers almost every day, and when he can’t make it 
in, he calls Martin to let him know. (This habit comes 
from his mother, who says it’s good practice for when he 
has a job.) On another day at the co-op, I see him help a 
thirty-year-old man overhaul an old commuter bike.
It’s not all rosy, Martin tells me. Whenever a space tries 
to welcome everyone, tensions can arise. How does the 
atmosphere change when a ten-year old joins the co-op? 
How should Martin respond when a poor teenager starts 
stealing tools? What should he do when an older man 
from the neighborhood says something racially insensi-
tive? Martin says these questions are always on his mind. 
He has no clear answers, but that doesn’t bother him. 
Searching for solutions—even trying to get close—is the 
only way to start making things better. 
Besides, sometimes tension is useful. On a bike, ten-
sion is what allows you to shift from one gear to another, 
what makes the brakes work. One day in the shop, Mar-
tin tells me he thinks it’s inevitable that some people will 
feel uncomfortable in a place like this. Maybe that’s okay. 
Without tension, they could never ride.
