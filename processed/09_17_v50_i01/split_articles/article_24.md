The day her son Brent died, Karine Heard had a 
migraine. She was at a drive-through bank teller when 
he called, asking whether she had a piece of his mail at 
home. “Probably. I’ll have to look,” she whispered into 
her phone, trying to be discreet. She thought about asking 
him to lunch but decided against it because of her headache. Brent told her he needed a document that matched 
the name on his ID so he could check into a methadone 
clinic—another attempt at getting clean.

Heard, who lives in Waterford, was used to juggling 
her son’s addiction treatment. Brent had begun taking 
synthetic heroin when he was just 14, crushing it up and 
snorting it. Soon he started injecting it through an IV. 
At that time, Brent’s older brother Randy, a model with 
the Ford Models agency, was living in New York and also 
using heroin. The brothers had been in the same social 
circles at Waterford High School but never took the drug 
together. “They had that respect for each other,” Heard 
says. Most of their old cohort is gone now; since they graduated high school, about two of their friends have fatally 
overdosed each year.

Drug overdose is the leading cause of death for Americans under the age of 50. Last year alone, there were 
sixty thousand fatal drug overdoses, the majority of which 
involved opioids. It’s an epidemic that has ravaged communities across the country, from towns nestled in the 
Appalachian Mountains to cities along the Connecticut 
coast:  Waterford, Bridgeport, New Haven. Although Connecticut ranks twenty-ninth in terms of state population, 
it has the eleventh highest opioid-related death rate in 
the country. And it’s only getting worse. The Connecticut 
Medical Examiner’s Ofﬁce predicts 1,078 drug overdose 
deaths in the state this year, an eighteen percent increase 
from 2016.

Young adults between the ages of 18 and 25, who tend 
to be both emotionally and ﬁnancially dependent on their 
parents, are the hardest-hit population in the opioid epidemic. In recognition of young peoples’ vulnerability to 
addiction, Connecticut has begun to shift its priorities. 
The state has poured $335 million into its substance abuse 
services, funneling state funding into in-home treatment, 
including “family therapy teams” that work with young 
people and their relatives on substance abuse issues. Doctors are now allowed to prescribe Narcan, an opioid antidote, more easily, and teens’ friends have legal immunity 
if they administer Narcan while themselves high or in 
possession of drugs.

But no amount of funding can fully alleviate the weight 
of suffering that the families of addicted people shoulder. 
In Heard’s court statement to the man sentenced for dealing the drugs that killed her son, she prayed that he change 
his life and offered forgiveness. “You are someone’s son,” 
she told him. “You have a mother.”

For families, addiction treatment isn’t just a one-time 
effort, but a circuitous process of decision-making and 
waiting. Many ﬁnd the landscape of treatment options 
overwhelming to navigate, especially when programs are 
overcrowded or have prohibitively high costs. Some parents ﬁrst reach out to those who have already struggled 
through a child’s addiction, relying on social networks 
like the one created by Community Speaks Out, an organization based in New London. Sometimes families can 
afford to send their child to a comprehensive, expensive 
long-term program like Turnbridge, a rehabilitation center on Orange Street in New Haven. But other families 
are largely absent from their children’s recovery processes, 
and those struggling with addiction ﬁnd surrogate communities in places like Teen Challenge, a Christian recovery center located near New Haven Union Station.


No matter the route, addiction treatment is a complex 
process: doctors ﬁrst recommend detox, then a thirty- or 
forty-ﬁve-day rehabilitation program, followed by a stay 
in a sober house or a safe, monitored environment. But 
families face difﬁculties at each stage. Health insurance 
doesn’t always cover addiction treatment and the dearth of 
regulated, affordable options creates a cycle of relapse for 
people recovering from addiction. If a person does complete a rehabilitation program—despite steep dropout 
rates—they are still far from recovery. Sober houses have 
high risks of relapse, as they are unregulated and generally 
have no security, bed checks, or visitor restrictions.

Three New London County mothers have recently 
stepped in to guide other families through the throes of 
addiction and substance abuse treatment. In 2015, Tammy 
de la Cruz, Linda Labbe, and Lisa Cote Johns founded 
Community Speaks Out, an organization aimed at helping families navigate treatment options. It was a struggle 
that the other mothers knew all too well—each of their 
families, too, had been touched in some way by addiction.

The group formed when de la Cruz’s son, Joey Gingerella, started speaking at local high schools about his 
battle with addiction. Joey died last December, not from 
a needle but from a bullet. He was killed outside a Groton bar when he intervened to stop a man from beating 
his girlfriend. The three mothers persevered through 
this tragedy, continuing their mission to support affected 
families and increase awareness of addiction prevention 
programs. So far, they have reached communities all over 
Connecticut and have helped over two hundred people 
enter rehabilitation programs.

Their organization offers assistance with every part of 
their clients’ needs. In addition to working day jobs, the 
three women manage support groups, conventions, and 
legislative initiatives, and help clients navigate insurance 
coverage. Their work with recovering addicts is tireless—
and uncompensated. “If someone wants to go to rehabilitation,” Cote Johns says, “we get them in.”

Community Speaks Out absorbs new (non-paying) clients into a network of sympathy and encouragement, and 
the women stay in constant contact with them. Cote Johns 
doesn’t hesitate to shoulder other families’ heartaches; it’s 
part of the job, she says. She has called one mother twice 
a week for the past year to check in on her children. “We 
become family,” Cote Johns sighed. It’s a bond that no 
one wants to have to share, but one that becomes an essential lifeline during periods of familial conﬂict or grief.

This past January, Community Speaks Out received 
major recognition for its work: a ﬁve thousand dollar 
grant from Lawrence + Memorial Hospital in New London, an afﬁliate of Yale-New Haven Hospital. Through 
the grant, Community Speaks Out will become Connecticut’s ﬁrst designated certiﬁer of sober houses. After undergoing training in March with the Massachusetts Alliance 
for Sober Housing, de la Cruz, Labbe, and Cote Johns 
called up every New London sober house, inviting each to 
register with the organization. So far, six have registered. 
Their regulation requires consistent safeguards like curfew check-ins, visitor regulations, Narcan availability, and 
training. The group is starting in New London, but hopes 
to expand across Connecticut to cities like New Haven.

The need to regulate sober houses is a personal one for 
Cote Johns. The year her son Christopher died, he was 33, 
hoping to get back on his feet after a thirteen-year battle 
with addiction and six months in jail for violating probation. He had become hooked on drugs after taking prescription pain medications for routine surgeries in high 
school. On the day Christopher was released from jail, 
he had been sober for almost eight months. One of Cote 
Johns’s friends picked him up and took him to a rehabilitation center, but all the beds were full.

For recovering addicts, ﬁnding an available spot in a 
rehab center after a detox program can be extremely challenging. Cote Johns estimates that nine out of the ten 
times she calls a center, all the beds are full. In theory, 
New Haven has ﬁfteen “Substance Abuse Care Facilities,” but that number includes only a couple of dedicated 
rehab centers.

Since Christopher had already detoxed on his own and 
had to wait on rehabilitation, he and Cote Johns’ friend 
drove directly to a sober house in New London. There 
are thirty sober houses in New London; New Haven has 
thirty-three. None are registered and few have any regulations. Though they are supposed to be safe places for 
people to recover from addiction, in reality, anyone can 
walk in and hand drugs to the residents. Christopher had 
stayed at many sober houses, and at every one of them, 
people were taking drugs.

The ﬁrst few months of sobriety, when recovering 
addicts transition from detox to rehabilitation, are a critical window in the recovery process. In this period, they 
experience the physical effects of opioid withdrawal—
anxiety, nausea, and vomiting—while learning to cope 
with stress without drugs. Many are tempted to start using 
again when cravings are intense and supervision is not. 
Those ﬁrst few months are also when most fatal overdoses 
occur. People fresh out of detox may not realize their tolerance has dropped, so a once-routine dose can kill them.

Christopher knew detox programs didn’t work. He told 
Cote Johns, “We need to ﬁx ourselves from the inside. I 
have to change this, Mom.”

But Christopher wasn’t able to save himself, and Cote 
Johns couldn’t save him, either.  He died while living in 
a sober house and waiting for a spot in a rehabilitation 
program. One of his friends had walked in and given him 
the drugs that would kill him. One of Cote Johns’ friends 
found Christopher’s body the next day, after kicking down 
the door of his room.

Two years ago, Karine Heard, Brent’s mother, met 
Cote Johns at a forum for parents of children with addiction at Montville High School in Oakdale, Connecticut. 
The two women immediately bonded over their experiences with their sons. Brent was still alive at the time, 
but Cote Johns’s son Christopher had died in 2014 and 
Heard had already lost Randy. In the years since, the two
