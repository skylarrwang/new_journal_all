THE  NEW  JOURNAL
Yale Law School who issued an open letter to the administra-
tion, believe that the University is actively defying labor law.
In the purview of the past twenty years of labor history, 
the current situation could best be described as “business as 
usual.” Some legacies, it seems, are harder to shake than oth-
ers.


On the morning of last year’s Commencement Day, 33 
Wall Street was unusually empty; the action was elsewhere. 
About ﬁve blocks away, in UNITE HERE’s downtown ofﬁces, 
local labor activists were preparing for a protest march that 
had brought hundreds of union supporters from across the 
East Coast to New Haven. Auto workers, fast food workers, 
union families, and graduate student teachers from other 
universities congregated on streets around the New Haven 
Green. “Union power in the ivory tower!” they chanted, 
sporting orange t-shirts and mortar boards. 

In the weeks leading up to commencement, graduating 
seniors and the University administration had voiced con-
cerns that the protesters would disrupt the ceremonies by 
seizing the stage or blocking the path of the formal proces-
sion. But the action was orderly and celebratory. 

The demonstration halted on the corner of Elm and Col-
lege Streets, where the marchers faced the graduating class 
of 2017. Behind a line of police motorcycles, the ﬁnal group 
of Local 33’s fasters sat in wheelchairs, in front of a crowd 
of cheering union supporters and a blue banner that pro-
claimed, “Just the beginning, Yale.” The protesters cheered 
on the graduating seniors; some students shouted back words 
of support. 

The Local 33 marchers seemed proud and deﬁant, but in 
many ways, it wasn’t their day to celebrate. When the formal 
procession was over, the protesters continued their march to 
City Hall. There, the eight remaining hunger strikers broke 
their fast, drinking cups of warm butternut soup. They hud-
dled underneath a white tent as a light drizzle fell on down-
town New Haven. They were in good spirits, but weary. In a 
few days, campus would empty out for the summer. The ﬁght 
was far from won.

Yale, for its part, had already begun its counter-attack. 
On Commencement Day, volunteers distributed water bot-
tles and palm-sized pamphlets along the procession’s path. 
The pamphlet, entitled “Information on Graduate Student 
Unionization,” was a preventative measure. It contained a 
two-part argument that the graduate student teachers had 
seen before: one, graduate student teachers at Yale were orga-
nizing undemocratically; two, graduate student teachers at 
Yale were among the most privileged in the country.

The material structures that had deﬁned Local 33 during 
its stint of campus prominence were also quietly removed. 
At dawn on May 25, a crew of non-union maintenance work-
ers dismantled 33 Wall Street. The following weekend, when 
alumni descended upon campus for college reunions, no 
sign of union activity was in sight.

The summer’s peace didn’t last long, however. On 
August 25, as ﬁrst-years arrived on campus, a curious struc-
ture appeared on the New Haven Green. The bowshed was 
smaller and entirely orange this time, but similarly hand-
some. As Yale’s newest class swarmed Old Campus, members 
of Local 33 stood in front of the cleverly-named “33 College 
Street,” exchanging smiles and handing out ﬂiers to ﬁrst-
years and their families.

In his 1996 article about the history of unionization at Yale, 
John Wilhelm, then-president of UNITE HERE, reﬂected 
on labor struggles new and old. “It’ll take a while, but I think 
all of us will get over the discouragement and taste a little 
bit of the joy and the freedom and the power of that kind of 
struggle,” he said. “Some of us have had the privilege to go 
through it before.” The legacy of past labor struggles may be 
hard to shake, but not for a lack of trying.
