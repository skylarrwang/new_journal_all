have remained close, sharing memories and moments of 
solace: Cote Johns will call up Heard and say, “Let’s go 
light lanterns.” They’ll spend the evening on the deck of 
Cote Johns’s house in Groton, talking about their sons. 
For Cote Johns, losing a child to addiction is “a different 
kind of pain, because you feel like you failed as a parent, 
as a mom.”


Last January, sipping tea in a Panera Bread in Water-
ford, Heard recounts what happened to her sons in a soft 
voice. It’s not an easy story to tell. She shifts uncomfort-
ably in her navy sweatshirt and rests a well-manicured 
hand nervously on her neck. When Brent was almost 18, 
20-year-old Randy overdosed and died, she says. “Brent—
he just couldn’t live with the fact that his brother was 
gone,” Heard says. “It was too much for him.” Brent’s drug 
use grew worse, he dropped out of high school, and that 
year he cycled through thirty-day rehabilitation programs 
in New Haven. Heard tried to give him the support and 
resources he needed, but it wasn’t enough.


For a client with private health insurance, Community 
Speaks Out could make a call to Turnbridge, a long-term 
rehabilitation center in New Haven, located on Orange 
Street near the New Haven Green. Turnbridge does not 
accept Connecticut’s public insurance, Husky, and it is 
out of network for most private insurance plans, meaning 
that copays are high. Turnbridge would not conﬁrm its 
fees, but most thirty-day programs like it are forty thou-
sand dollars. It’s a price tag that some, like Cote Johns, 
believe is far too high.
But at Turnbridge (formerly called ‘Turning Point’) cli-
ents aren’t pushed out after any set period of time. Lauren 
Springer, the center’s Family Liaison, believes the open 
timeline ensures that each participant heals completely 
and leaves only when he or she is ready. No one can say 
for sure how long a broken bone will take to heal, and 
some say the same is true for addiction. While the detox 
phase is usually six weeks, according to Springer, some 
clients stay for over nine months.
At Turnbridge, the clients live in a large, classically 
New England stone house, surrounded by well-tended 
bushes and a lush green lawn. The website boasts a bas-
ketball court, gym, and art room. In Springer’s ofﬁce on 
Orange Street, where the students come during the day 
for meetings and treatment, Oriental rugs pattern the gray 
wood ﬂoors and candy is displayed on the desk. 
A stay at Turnbridge has three phases, the ﬁrst of which 
usually lasts six weeks and helps clients detox and come 
back to a healthy baseline. Exercise, healthy eating, and 
family meetings are all part of the process. In addition to 
his or her own family’s support, each client has a case man-
ager, a therapist, a sponsor, a psychiatric APRN licensed 
to prescribe, a program director, a family liaison, and a 
family therapist. By the third phase, clients have much 
more freedom: they can take the bus to jobs in downtown 
New Haven and have less frequent appointments at the 
Turnbridge ofﬁces on Orange Street.
Like Cote Johns, Springer entered the world of addic-
tion treatment support as a mother suffering through her 
son’s addiction. When she ﬁrst started attending Narcotics 
Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous support groups, 
she was terriﬁed. “My son’s not like those people,” she 
thought. But when she found that the groups helped her 
heal, she started a group just for parents, for which she 
still commutes to New Jersey to run. Later, she joined 
Turnbridge, where she helps families become “part of the 
team,” as she likes to say.
Turnbridge, which accepts clients between the ages of 
18 and 26, needs the support of parents. Springer tries to 
help each family come to terms with its child’s illness. 
Sometimes parents are the ﬁrst ones to call for help, but 
they need Springer to give them the conﬁdence to tell 
their children that coming to New Haven for treatment 
is the only option. Other times, parents will deny that a 
problem exists, insisting, for example, “When I was in 
college, I smoked a lot of weed, and I did ﬁne,” Springer 
says. But the most common issue is parents enabling their 
children’s continued drug use.


“No one wants to make a change until it’s just too 
uncomfortable where they are,” Springer says. She knows 
ﬁrsthand how hard it is, as a parent, to give your child 
unconditional love and support while not facilitating their 
addictive behaviors. Her son, who was once at Turnbridge 
but left in the middle of the program, is still using drugs. 
She admits that she doesn’t know where he is right now. “I 
will pay for treatment, I will visit him when he’s in treat-
ment, I will do whatever I can while staying on my side 
of the fence,” she says. The current situation “breaks her 
heart,” but she knows she can only do so much to guide 
and protect him.


Manny Barreto decided to change his life when he 
woke up from life support, his face wet with his aunt’s 
tears. It was the ﬁrst time he had ever overdosed. At the 
time, Barreto was a 28-year-old manufacturing marketer 
in Brooklyn, New York. He had started doing molly, 
which contains the drug MDMA, years before. But when 
his drug dealer ran into trouble in the neighborhood, he 
switched to pure MDMA, and then to Ecstasy.
The evening he overdosed, he drank alcohol, smoked 
weed, and took ﬁve different kinds of Ecstasy pills. The 
high hit all at once, and he stumbled downstairs to 
a friend’s apartment to ask for help before passing out. 
Though he faded in and out of consciousness in the 
ambulance, he remembers lying on the cot, wearing a 
wife beater in January, thinking, “This is the totality of my 
existence on the planet? I’m gonna die a drug addict in 
the back of an ambulance?”
Now a big-boned man with a dark mess of curls, glasses, 
and a black beard that widens with his grin, Barreto jokes 
that back then, he looked shriveled up, like a “turtle with-
out its shell.”
Barreto’s life was changed by Teen Challenge, a global 
Christian ministry that has a recovery house in New 
Haven, among other branches across the world. The 
New Haven outpost is located in a group of run-down 
wooden houses clustered on Spring Street, near New Hav-
en-Union Station and just a mile away from Turnbridge. 
Strictly speaking, it’s neither a rehabilitation center nor a 
homeless shelter, but there are beds, a shared kitchen, and 
sitting areas where the men discuss Bible passages. The 
organization opens its doors to anyone who wants to get 
closer to God, but most of the participants struggle with 
addiction, too. The New Haven location is only for men 
over the ages of 18, but Teen Challenge New England has 
three women’s homes, and there are branches on almost 
every continent of the world. “We run out of beds, we’ll 
get a sleeping bag for you,” Barreto says.
After Barreto’s mother became abusive, he was adopted 
by his aunt and uncle, both of whom are ministers. Grow-
ing up, he knew about Teen Challenge’s ministry work, 
and the organization visited their church from time to 
time. So, when his aunt pulled back the curtain in the 
emergency room and said, “Are you ready to go to Teen 
Challenge?” Barreto was too tired to refuse. Leaving 
everything behind in Brooklyn, he enrolled at the New 
Haven location in 2012 and has been there ever since, ﬁrst 
as a client and now as a staff member.
In many ways, the ﬁfteen-month program is similar to 
other long-term rehabilitation programs like Turnbridge. 
It has four phases, each one emphasizing personal disci-
pline, healing from the inside, and making plans for a 
healthy future. There are chores, mentors, and, in the last 
phase, job opportunities.
But the programs differ in terms of how they approach 
family involvement. At Teen Challenge, men are cut off 
from their families and friends in order to avoid the temp-
tation to return to their old lives. Barreto is no longer in 
touch with anyone he used to use drugs with; almost all 
of those people have already died. At Turnbridge, par-
ents and families are integral parts of the healing process 
and receive training in how to support loved ones with 
addictions. Unlike the widespread support network at 
Turnbridge, Teen Challenge’s clients meet with a single 
mentor. Teen Challenge is unafraid to discipline men 
who relapse or disrespect authority, whereas Turnbridge 
treats relapse or behavioral issues with therapy and more 
time in the program. If someone smokes or talks back to a 
staff member at Teen Challenge, he will be set back in the 
program’s phases and given more chores. At Turnbridge 
last month, young men were vaping on the sidewalk.
The two programs also differ in the demographics of 
their clientele. While the opioid epidemic more broadly 
skews white—80 percent of drug overdose deaths in Con-
necticut this year have involved white people—in New 
Haven, where there are signiﬁcant Black and Hispanic 
populations, the epidemic crosses racial lines. Every client 
I saw in the hallways or outside at Turnbridge was white. 
At Teen Challenge, a car of Black men pulled out of the 
driveway and waved to me as they headed to their jobs 
in town. Turnbridge, which takes only private insurance 
for medical fees, also has residential fees that are around 
nine thousand dollars a month. At Teen Challenge, par-
ticipants are asked to give what they can, but it’s unusual 
that they can pay the fees in full: $750 per month, plus a 
$750 intake fee. Many men come for free. And there are 
no medical bills, as no doctors work in the Teen Chal-
lenge house.
Comparing the success of the two programs is difﬁcult. 
In 2017, Turnbridge published an outcome study report-
ing that 70 percent of all of its clients reach one year of 
sobriety and 80 percent of that group complete another 
year. These numbers are striking compared to the national 
average; the National Center on Addiction and Substance 
estimates that only 30 percent of all people who complete 
a rehab program are successful. But addiction is a life-long 
struggle, and Turnbridge clients could easily relapse after 
two years. The most recent numbers on Teen Challenge 
are from a 1999 dissertation at Northwestern, in which a 
political science graduate student found that 86 percent of 
clients were drug-free after three years, and, perhaps most 
strikingly, 91 percent were employed.
In the ﬁrst part of the program at Teen Challenge, men 
detox without drugs to wean them off heroin. Barreto says 
that opioid-based detox clinics that use drugs like metha-
done, a synthetic opioid, don’t solve addiction; they just 
substitute one form of it for another. After all, he asks, 
what’s the point of getting clean? To “experience life.” 
He’s seen men come to the program because, even after 
ten years, they couldn’t kick their methadone addiction. 
The ﬁrst thing Barreto tells incoming men is to accept the 
fact that, whatever their addiction, it will tempt them to 
leave. When their cravings start to push them toward the 
door, they have Barreto’s phone number and are told to 
call if he is not in his ofﬁce. At private-pay rehabilitation 
centers, Barreto says, the staff clocks out at 5 p.m. They 
call it “boundaries,” he scoffs.
Barreto knows how hard it can be to resist the temp-
tation of leaving. But he was sustained by the other men 
in the program, like his now-colleague Steve Stokes, the 
program supervisor, who was six months into the program 
when Barreto ﬁrst arrived. Unlike Barreto, when Stokes 
came to the program, he had already been in and out of 
rehabilitation for more than ten years. In a thick Boston 
accent, he describes how it started when he began drink-
ing to the point of blacking out at the age of 13. He started 
self-medicating to deal with his Obsessive Compulsive 
Disorder (OCD). To add to his stress, his mother was abu-
sive and cheated on her Stokes’s father with his uncle, at 
which point Stokes’s father left. Stokes’s OCD resulted in 
powerful hallucinations that he experienced throughout 
his youth. When he was ten, he says, he was taking a test 
when a voice in his head warned him, “If you don’t get up 
and walk over to the chalkboard and break that piece of 
chalk right now, your dad’s gonna get into a car accident.” 
He got up, broke the chalk, and was kicked out of the 
classroom.
Stokes’s OCD was treated by doctors at McClean Hos-
pital OCD Institute in Boston, where he was prescribed 
Klonopin. But he began abusing the medication and using 
it alongside heroin. Klonopin makes a heroin overdose 
more likely. In addition to his drug use, Stokes’s anger 
problems, which he thinks developed as a result of his abu-
sive household, led him to crime and gangs. By the time 
he was 22, he had overdosed ten times. When he wasn’t 
in the hospital or a thirty-day program, he was washing 
his clothes in puddles and living in his car. Stokes’s dad 
tried to stay in his life, but after Stokes overdosed twice, he 
kicked him out of the house. “I can’t have you dying here 
on this couch,” his dad told him.
Stokes’s hands, wrapped in tattoos, start to ﬁdget as he 
goes through his story. As he recounts his last overdose, 
he pauses to wipe tears from his eyes. He had been on a
