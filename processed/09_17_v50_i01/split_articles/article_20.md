HOW HAVE UNIVERSITIES 
LIKE YALE HAD TO ADAPT 
WHEN INCREASING 
PORTIONS OF SIGNIFICANT 
DONATIONS COME 
FROM INTERNATIONAL 
DONORS—IN PARTICULAR, 
FROM WEALTHY CHINESE 
PHILANTHROPISTS?


Yale’s ﬁnancial enterprise operates apart from the 
stone-carved spires of Yale’s campus. The 180-person 
Ofﬁce of Development is housed on ﬂoors eight and 
nine of the tall, gray ofﬁce building on 157 Church 
Street, just off of the Green. Few students are privy to 
the intricate fundraising initiatives that take place in 
those rooms.

Fundraising for universities is a multilayered pro-
cess involving different types of solicitation. The ﬁrst 
two levels are annual giving and corporate fundraising, 
explained C.J. Menard, an independent development 
consultant at CJM Consulting, who has worked in the 
past for Harvard University and Boston University, and 
who currently serves as an administrative dean for Deer-
ﬁeld Academy in Massachusetts. Annual giving—what 
Menard calls the “scatter-bombing of fundraising”—is 
typically solicited from alumni en masse through elec-
tronic communication and social media appeals. Cor-
porate funds are obtained through more specialized 
interactions with companies and foundations.

Then there are the big donations from individuals —
major gifts. Deﬁned by Yale as a donation of one hun-
dred thousand dollars over the course of no more than 
ﬁve years, these donations are raised through highly 
personalized interactions with donors. Major gifts ofﬁ-
cers must “think every day about a very small group of 
people, about what they can do to help their relation-
ship with the university, and make the donor feel good 
about their donations,” said Menard. In recent years, 
as major gifts have become an increasingly import-
ant part of university fundraising efforts, development 
ofﬁces have “evolved into highly proactive, and highly 
customer-service oriented teams,” said Sarah Jackson, 
an independent major gift consultant based in Bos-
ton. Major gifts do not simply materialize out of thin 
air. They’re the product of years of donor cultivation, 
screening, and negotiations.

The ﬁrst meeting between Salovey and the Chief 
of Staff of the SOHO Foundation was orchestrated 
through an intricate web of relationships in the form 
of the Yale Asia Development Council. Established 
in 2014, the Council consists of a group of sixty-four 
inﬂuential men and women, including Zhang and 
Pan, interested in strengthening strategic partner-
ships between Yale and Asia. According to a private 
document, the membership consists mostly of CEOs 
of investment banks, hedge funds, and private equity 
ﬁrms—from Bank of America to Morgan Stanley to the 
Lenovo Group—and founders of some of the largest 
start-up organizations in China, such as e-commerce 
giant Alibaba and internet provider Tencent. The 
council is a microcosm of the new economic elite of 
Asia: more than ﬁfty of the sixty-four members work 
in the ﬁnancial and real estate sectors, and ﬁfty-seven 
come from Hong Kong or China, with the rest coming 
from India, Japan, and Korea. Most members are either 
alumni of Yale or have children currently attending the 
university.

“It’s more like the Yale Council of Potential Donors,” 
joked one council member who asked to remain anon-
ymous. Currently, Lei serves as Chair of the Council, 
and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger as its 
Honorary Chair. “Looking around the room, I found 
that I mostly recognized everyone — lawyers, bankers, 
successful entrepreneurs,” said the same council mem-
ber, describing the inaugural meeting in March 2014, 
held in a gilded conference space at The Conrad, a 
luxury hotel in Hong Kong. 


of the Yale Corporation) to the School of Management 
and a sixteen million dollar donation from Chinese 
entrepreneurs Neil Shen SOM ’92, Brad Huang SOM 
’90, and Bob Xu to establish the Yale Center of Beijing. 
Joseph Tsai, co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant 
Alibaba, donated thirty million dollars to rename the 
Yale China Law Center the Paul Tsai Center, in honor 
of his father, and made another large donation for the 
Tsai Center for Innovative Thinking at Yale. 

Although money appears to be dropping from the 
sky, the process behind these donations is complex. 
What happens when ten million dollars is shuttled 
from a wealthy donor to an institution like Yale? How 
are relationships with international donors cultivated? 
And most importantly, how have universities like Yale 
had to adapt when increasing portions of signiﬁcant 
donations come from international donors—in partic-
ular, from wealthy Chinese philanthropists? 


At that ﬁrst meeting, Salovey and Lei, seated at the 
front of the room, introduced the council’s purpose: 
to “advance Yale’s involvement in Asia on a coun-
try-by-country basis” and “identify opportunities for 
new strategic and fundraising alliances.” Over lunch, 
each member received a blue binder with Yale’s new 
initiatives in Asia, and lunch was served.

“We all kind of knew that the main reason we were 
together was to encourage us to donate,” the anony-
mous council member claimed. “But there was never 
a point where they asked, ‘Please give to the school.’ 
There was never a solicitation of a donation. It was very 
subtly and tactfully done.” To follow up, James McDon-
ald, the Senior Director of International Fundraising at 
Yale at the time, sent email updates and council meet-
ing invitations. “This Jim McDonald guy has kept in 
touch with me for three years,” said the council mem-
ber. “But there was never a suggestion that I should 
be giving, even though you know that his key job is to 
solicit money.”

The members of the council, like all potential 
donors, were carefully researched beforehand. The 
Yale Development Ofﬁce has a team that researches all 
top-level donors, hires external consultants, brings in 
lawyers from the Yale general council ofﬁce, and con-
sults trusted friends in the Yale network, like Lei, to 
weigh in. In the case of the SOHO Scholarship dona-
tions, Zhang and Pan had Lei’s seal of approval. 

In spite of the growing inﬂux of donations from 
China, giving money to universities is still a uniquely 
American concept. Within the U.S., the job of solicit-
ing donations is a “well-choreographed routine where 
everyone knows what to expect,” said Menard. The 
U.S. has a widespread culture of philanthropy. “Every-
one donates,” explained Menard, “regardless if it’s a 
multi-million-dollar donation or ﬁve dollars to your 
local Audubon Society.” But, outside of the U.S., the 
concept of donating to an alma mater is novel. Menard 
remembers how an international alumnus at Boston 
University once compared donations to universities to 
buying a sweater at a store and then receiving a letter 
from the store ﬁve years later, saying, “‘Hey look, you 
bought a sweater from us once, and now we’re expand-
ing the store, do you think you could give us hand?’ 
The guy thought, ‘I got a diploma at BU and I paid for 
it,’” recounted Menard. “‘So why are you asking me for 
money years later?’”

Conducting international fundraising from China 
is therefore not for the faint of heart or budget: travel 
is hard, outreach efforts are costly, and success is ulti-
mately unpredictable. “In China,” Menard says, “all 
the things we know how to do go ﬂying out of the win-
dow.”


After three years of emails from McDonald, the 
council member with whom I spoke never ended up 
donating to Yale. “I would guess that 90 percent of the 
people at the meeting do not give money,” he specu-
lated. But when the other 10 percent, donors like Pan 
and Zhang, do decide to donate, they give ten million 
dollars.

“Who knows?” the council member asked. “If Jim 
keeps this up for ten years, maybe I’ll start to feel like I 
have an obligation to donate too.”


Solicitation is only the ﬁrst part of the game. The 
second, harder part comes next: negotiation. Today, 
according to Terry Holcombe ‘64, a development con-
sultant who worked as the Vice President for Alumni 
Affairs and Development at Yale from 1981 to 1998, this 
process has grown more challenging. “When I began, 
gifts were simply given. Now they’re almost always 
negotiated,” Holcombe told the Yale Alumni Maga-
zine in 2001. “Donors have become more inquisitive, 
more assertive, and more speciﬁc about what they give 
money for.” 

 “Gone are the days of unrestricted philanthropy in 
which donors give and explicitly trust the institution to 
use their funds widely,” echoed consultant Sarah Jack-
son. This paradigm shift has given rise to what develop-
ment professionals have called “venture philanthropy” 
in American universities. An increasing number of 
donors see their gifts as a form of investment and expect 
to be involved in the way their money is used.

In the case of the SOHO scholarships, Zhang and 
Pan had explicitly articulated intentions: to provide 
American education—what they perceived as a crucial 
path to greater social mobility—to young, low-income 
Chinese students. Zhang attributes her own transfor-
mation from a factory girl to a billionaire entrepreneur 
to the scholarships she received from Sussex University 
and Cambridge. Because she wants to replicate this 
opportunity for students like her, the SOHO donations 
come with clear stipulations. The scholarship guaran-
tees that the income from the donations will always go

MORE INQUISITIVE, MORE 
ASSERTIVE, AND MORE 
SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT 
THEY GIVE MONEY FOR.
