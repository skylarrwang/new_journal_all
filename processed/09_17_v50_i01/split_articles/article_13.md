“I’m always trying to explain this. I always have trouble. 
I think it’s such a lonely thing to do. People in Berlin go to 
techno clubs alone and take pills alone and then go home—
even if you go to techno clubs with friends you don’t really 
talk to them or even dance with them. You walk through 
these bombed-out industrial parts of the city, and see these 
scattered people holding beer bottles all headed in the same 
direction, and then you wait in line, and don’t hear so much 
German, and when you get in there, all it is is what you 
expected: boom boom boom boom.”

Bernardo paused and passed me the shisha pipe. I like the 
pipe. It lets one person hold the ﬂoor while the other one’s 
smoking. I took it and watched him, hunched over, eyes dart-
ing around the printed curtains and sleepy, chuckling men 
in the dusky room. He and I were at a smoking lounge on 
a humid Monday night in July. I felt a bit sheepish talking 
about this, especially in English, in a Syrian cafe, in Ber-
lin, a city that so many foreign young people ﬂock to for a 
few weeks or months or years because of its legendary techno 
scene. But for that same reason I felt it was a silly thing to 
ignore. 

 “I dunno, I think I get it though,” he continued. “I went 
last weekend again, after I’d been feeling off for days. I’d just 
ﬁnished my German test and had been sitting around for-
ever in the kitchen in a bathrobe, and when I got into the 
club I was still feeling so uneasy. What was I doing there? 
I’m from Mexico but I haven’t lived there in ﬁve years. What 
was I doing in Germany thinking about my life in English—
not even in Spanish—in this dark basement with all these 
other people? But I stayed anyway and after a while…man 
it’s hard to explain, it’s such a non-linguistic experience…but 
after a while I just started to feel alright there. Once I looked 
around, and saw all of these pulsing silhouettes, and thought 
of myself among all these other rootless people with similar 
thoughts running through their minds, it was just okay to be 
there—that’s all. Just this sense that I’m here, and I’m okay. 
Reverberating over and over.” 

I passed Bernardo the pipe when he ﬁnished. We had both 
been in Berlin for months off the vague intuition that we’d 
like it here—me intending to go back to America in August, 
him to stay indeﬁnitely. We tutored and babysat enough to 
get by. We hung out with Mexicans with European pass-
ports and Germans from other states and Syrian refugees 
and English people tired of England. We had so much time 
to talk. We’d had three thousand conversations in this way 
before, over beers or water pipes, about why people do things. 
I’d been aware of techno as a sexy and sinister part of the 
city’s folklore: huge cold rooms, everyone dancing alone and 
facing front, staying inside from early Friday morning until 
they stumbled out on Sunday afternoon. But Bernardo and 
I hadn’t talked about it since my ﬁrst week in Berlin, in the 
dead of February, when we had gone to a tiny dance club to 
see a DJ in a tan body suit play the keytar and toss around a 
slightly smaller dummy of himself and I’d turned to Bernardo 
and said, “This is the worst.”
“But why did we show up for it?” he’d replied. “Why was

this the thing we decided to do tonight? I think it speaks to all 
the rootless people here…” 

We’d yelled in each other’s ears for a bit longer and after 
a while I’d checked my phone. Somehow I’d composed an 
email to my dad, no text in the body, just a subject headed 
“Swazi”. I tried to cancel it but sent it instead. The DJ threw 
his dummy into the crowd for body surﬁng. I turned to a 
woman who I’d met earlier that night and asked her what she 
thought of this. 
“I like it,” she’d said, dancing. “It’s strange.” She’d paused 
as the DJ snatched his dummy back, then added, “after the 
whole day working…”

After the whole day working! I’d really started to enjoy 
myself after that, just for the thought of everyone who wanted 
to see something strange after the whole day working. And 
after the DJ had ﬁnished and we’d all rushed out to the frigid 
cobblestone street I checked my phone again, 4 a.m. in Ber-
lin, 10 p.m. in New York, and my dad had already replied to 
my email:


? 

What does this mean? 

But for months after that weekend I’d forgotten about 
techno. I liked small concerts and classrooms and public 
transit; well-lit places with other personalities to latch onto. 
It was only by this point in mid summer that I could start 
to see what Bernardo was now explaining—I’d gone to one 
of the thumping basement clubs a few nights before, not on 
pills though I’m sure it helps, and after a few confused hours 
standing in strobe lights, plumes of water vapor, the smell of 
mold and the incessant vibrating bass drum that tries to pull 
your muscles from their sheaths, I started to feel like I’d never 
make it out of there. And soon I started to build a strange 
sort of focus, almost like sleeping. The day’s events started to 
course through my mind: a long delayed train, a distracted 
twelve-year-old who didn’t care about intro paragraphs, my 
own distraction from wondering why I had to teach them, a 
chilling look my roommate gave me as she opened the fridge, 
wide streets, rain, YouTube videos; I started to run through 
whole conversations from that day just for the pleasure of 
memory, and because the smoke was getting in my eyes and 
no one was touching; and every few measures I’d remember 
again how bizarre this was—that someone would need to be 
in this hellish underground crypt just to have some peace and 
think about her day. But the music would move on and soon 
I would too, until a sentence would wriggle into my mind 
and repeat, I never learn I never learn I never learn, and keep 
repeating until it was pounded out of me, and at the same 
time pounded in.

Soon the lights had changed and I started to think about 
all the times in Berlin I’d been in crowds like this. Bernardo 
and I had spent the ﬁrst of May together, the holiday to 
commemorate workers’ rights, when the city blocks off the 
streets in the center of town and releases the youth there to 
day-drink and walk toward a park. There’s no event in the 
park, just more day-drinking. I’d felt a vague uneasiness the 
whole time. And to climb out of that techno club ﬁnally into 
Wednesday morning sunshine and take the train home with 
construction workers and kids off to school—it felt wily and 
wonderful to invert the day like that, but it really made me 
wonder if Berlin doesn’t just exist for so many people as a big 
ﬂat place to wander around dazed. 

Bernardo and I leaned back on the velvet couches and 
looked at the ceiling. A laugh erupted from the group of men 
sitting behind us. I saw Bernardo clock them, and look at me, 
and we both listened to them josh one of the guys in Arabic 
for a while. 
“The funny thing is I heard two guys talking about the 
exact same thing yesterday,” Ber-nardo said ﬁnally, passing 
me the pipe. He’d been letting it burn idly. “In English, 
in two vaguely foreign accents. They were saying how pro-
foundly they experienced themselves in the techno club and 
everything. It annoyed the hell outta me.” 

He smiled a little. I could imagine those two guys exactly—
long hair, tattoos, all in black, smoking rolled cigarettes. Two 
European assholes in Berlin to party, probably not there to 
see something strange after the whole day working. For a 
moment I imagined all the pairs of people like that across 
the city having our same conversation, and I turned on every-
thing Bernardo and I had been thinking. I wanted it out of 
me, that inward experience I had to share, that sad transcen-
dent feeling of communion with all those rootless people that 
only happens in booming nightclubs, and disappears when 
we overhear each other in daylight. It was embarrassing.

The group behind us started laughing again. “Seems like a 
fun group of guys,” Bernardo said. “Better than the guys I saw 
yesterday, sucks to suck…” 

I looked at Bernardo sitting there, mulling over the next 
thing he wanted to say. And I wanted to change the subject, 
but more strongly I wanted to hear what was on the tip of his 
tongue…so all I did was laugh and tell him to quit hassling 
those guys. Those assholes have seen beautiful things.
