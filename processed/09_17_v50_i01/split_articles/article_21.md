to students from China that have need, regardless of 
any external economic changes. In the event of is an 
economic recession, such a stipulation would act as a 
kind of shield against market forces that could affect 
Yale’s endowment and its ability to support the educa-
tion of low-income Chinese students. The Yale Devel-
opment Ofﬁce has also had to prove to SOHO that they 
would make a more targeted effort to recruit students 
from rural Chinese provinces, regions from which the 
university has not admitted many students in the past. 
Given cultural differences between American and 
Chinese philanthropy, the process of negotiation is not 
always comfortable. An example of such a difference 
is the Chinese emphasis on efﬁciency. “Development 
ofﬁcers from the U.S. are used to the long, drawn-out 
cultivation process,” said Menard. “I get to know you 
and you get to know me. You know I am a fundraiser, 
but it is a while before we actually start a serious con-
versation about the big gift.” In China, the process 
is accelerated. “China is a place where two strangers 
will meet over dinner and halfway through they will 
have told each other how much they earn,” explained 
Menard, who often dealt with Chinese donors in his 
work. “The Chinese are not squeamish about their 
money.”

Speed is not unique to China: it also characterizes 
the major gifts negotiations of many rapidly develop-
ing nations across the globe, such as the United Arab 
Emirates, Russia, and India. Boston University, where 
Menard used to work as a development ofﬁcer, once 
sent out a questionnaire to alumni asking them to share 
their net worth. “Some rich guy in Dubai checked the 
highest category, of ﬁfty million dollars plus,” said 
Menard. “Twenty-six months later, he signed the larg-
est gift in the history of the university, having had zero 
contact before and having made zero previous gifts. 
This was incredible, but when we are talking about 
international gifts—from places like China—it is not 
that uncommon anymore.” 

One point of contention, though, is that Chinese 
philanthropists may have an agenda that does not 
match the ethos of American universities. In China, 
“donors tend to be more transactional,” said Menard. 
“There is an expectation of quid pro quo.” Admissions 
is particularly sticky territory for international donors. 
“Throughout my years of doing this, I have certainly 
ﬁelded calls from representatives of families that go 
along the lines of: this family has a son or daughter, the 
father would like to write a check, how big a check?”

Tom Tseng, Vice President of Development at the 
University of Hawaii, has had many similar experi-
ences. “Some people might have gotten well-meaning 
but erroneous advice that if one gave a large sum of 
money, that one’s child or children would be guaran-
teed admissions to the desired institution,” he said. 
Universities strive make clear at every step of the 
conversation that there is no quid pro quo, particularly 
with regards to the admission process. Admissions deci-
sions by Yale in theory are always made before negotia-
tions about donations begin. 

Yale, however, is rich. Not all universities have the 
luxury and the ﬁnancial means to adhere to such prin-
ciples. Donations in exchange for admissions are not 
unheard of among less well-endowed universities. 
According to a Kaplan Test Prep survey, one hundred 
admissions ofﬁcers from four hundred top colleges and 
universities said that they have “felt pressured to accept 
an applicant who didn’t meet the school’s admissions 
requirements because of who that applicant was con-
nected to.”


Regardless of the messy motivations attached to 
these donations, major gifts from China will only con-
tinue to pour into American universities thanks to a 
combination of powerful, historical forces at work: a 
deep-rooted, century-long Confucian education tradi-
tion, the growing international appeal of the American 
model of the liberal arts college, and most crucially, 
China’s rapid economic growth.

The nation’s economic boom in the last three 
decades has resulted in an explosion of highly concen-
trated wealth holders (there are now 335 billionaires in 
China) similar to those in the United States in the late 
nineteenth century. “We once had our robber barons, 
Carnegies and Mellons. What did they do with all their 
new money? They built yachts, huge mansions and 
sent their kids to the ﬁnest schools,” explained Menard. 
“But at some point, after spending all this money, they 
had to sit back and think—what next? What do I do 
with all this great wealth? The next, natural step was 
philanthropy.”

Many young Chinese investors and entrepreneurs,

having gone through a similar thought process, directed 
their philanthropic efforts to education. According 
to a study done by the China Philanthropy Project, a 
research effort established in 2015 at the Harvard Ash 
Center to identify trends in charitable giving among 
China’s wealthy, more than two-thirds of the hundred 
philanthropists surveyed cited education as one of the 
causes that they support. They are also increasingly 
choosing to direct their efforts abroad. “As their per-
sonal experience becomes more global, their children 
are educated abroad and they tend to acquire foreign 
property,” said Edward Cunningham, Director of the 
Ash Center China Programs, in an interview published 
on the Ash Center’s website. “The social network of 
these newly wealthy will tend to globalize.” In the last 
two years alone, Hong Kong investor Gerald Chan 
donated two hundred ﬁfty million dollars to the Har-
vard School of Public Health, and Columbia Univer-
sity received ﬁve million dollars to establish the Tang 
Center for Early China. And those are just the big gifts. 
 “Word of mouth spreads fast. A Chinese parent will 
send a kid to Yale, become familiar with the American 
concept of donating, tell their friends, who’ll start to 
donate too,” explained Menard. “It’s a snowball that 
just keeps growing.”

As Chinese philanthropy matures and globalizes, 
fundraising teams across the United States are quick 
to adapt. “When I ﬁrst started this profession in 1987, 
other development ofﬁcers were always like, don’t 
waste your time outside of the United States, don’t 
bother with international donors,” said Menard. “A day 
in New York will beat a month anywhere else outside 
of this country.” 

Twenty years later, as donations roll in from China, 
international fundraising can no longer be an after-
thought. Go to a fundraising conference today, and 
it is hard to walk into any part of the room and not 
overhear a conversation in Chinese. “In the last ten 
years, I have seen a visible shift in not only front-line 
fundraisers who are either Chinese or Chinese-Amer-
icans [or] who are ﬂuent in Mandarin, but also non-
Asians who are proﬁcient in Chinese,” said Tseng, the 
VP at the University of Hawaii. The Council for the 
Advancement and Support of Education, a nonproﬁt 
association of educational institutions headquartered 
in Washington, D.C., opened an Asia-Paciﬁc branch 
in Singapore ten years ago and started to offer training 
conferences in Chinese in 2011. “To me, this shows a 
greater recognition that more cross-pollination, train-
ing, and better understanding between the East and 
the West has become imperative,” Tseng said. 

This growing Chinese inﬂuence is not always wel-
comed with open arms. Under a 1992 revision to the 
Higher Education Act of 1965, colleges and universi-
ties must annually report foreign gifts and contracts of 
two hundred ﬁfty thousand dollars or more to the U.S. 
Department of Education, a move intended to monitor 
inﬂuence from foreign donors. However, the type of 
inﬂuential Chinese donor that the United States once 
feared even a few years ago—one hoping to buy inﬂu-
ence for personal gain—may look very different from 
a Chinese donor today. According to Tseng, Chinese 
donors have evolved from “mere givers to philanthro-
pists,” he said. “Many are now partnering with institu-
tions with speciﬁc goals for the betterment of the future 
as opposed to simply having a leverage.” 

Tseng cited the one hundred ﬁfteen million dollar 
gift made last year by Chinese businesspeople Tianqiao 
Chen and Chrissy Luo to the California Institute of 
Technology to establish a new institute funding inter-
disciplinary brain research. Chen and Luo founded 
Shanda Interactive, the largest Internet entertainment 
developer in China. “We believe that uncovering how 
the brain perceives, interprets, and interacts with the 
world can shape groundbreaking industries, play a crit-
ical role in addressing social issues such as aging and 
behavioral deﬁciencies,” said Chen in an interview 
conducted by Caltech. “And even help answer ulti-
mate questions about life.”

Another example is Chen Yidan, founder of Chi-
nese Internet giant Tencent, who is known in China 
as “the First Philanthropist in the Internet Industry.” 
Chen is attempting to import models of American edu-
cation back home to China. One of his most signiﬁcant 
undertakings has been to single-handedly establish 
and endow Wuhan College, the ﬁrst private non-proﬁt 
school in central China. “There are many things that 
Chinese universities can learn from their American 
counterparts,” said Chen, “from residential college 
structures, to fostering a culture of alumni giving, to 
developing a liberal arts curriculum that teaches the 
whole person and not just a particular skill.” 

Shortly after his donation to the Yale China Law 
Center, Joe Tsai made another donation to support the

construction and launch of the Tsai Center for Inno-
vative Thinking at Yale (Tsai CITY). The Center will 
be located at the southern stretch of Prospect Street 
and Hillhouse Avenue, adjacent to the Center for Engi-
neering Innovation and Design. “For me, it is espe-
cially vital that young people in the world today gain 
comfort with taking risks—with framing the problem, 
thinking in an interdisciplinary way, and trying ‘out-of-
the-box’ approaches,” said Tsai, paying tribute to the 
role that innovative thinking has played on his own life 
and career trajectory as the co-founder of e-commerce 
giant Alibaba. 

Like the American nouveau riche of the late nine-
teenth century, wealthy Chinese like Tsai are preoc-
cupied with more than just questions of power, inﬂu-
ence, and how to get their children into Ivy League 
universities. They are grappling with familiar questions 
that accompany economic excess: How should I give 
back to my community? How can I create meaningful 
change?


After her talk at Sterling Memorial Library last 
November, Zhang met with the fourteen SOHO schol-
ars to discuss their experiences at Yale. When discus-
sion veered into the still-fresh Trump victory, Zhang 
was struck by the thoughtfulness of the students’ com-
ments. Most of the scholars had been in the U.S. for 
less than a year, yet they had become intensely invested 
in the nuances of American politics and the future of 
democracy. “I think that our conversation made her 
even more committed to donate to American universi-
ties,” said Barkley Dai ’20, one of the SOHO Scholars. 
“Trump campaigned on a platform of anti-globaliza-
tion and Zhang sees the scholarship as a force to coun-
teract that.” 

Fundraising for universities is messy and complex. 
Any process that deals with hunting down and secur-
ing large, unpredictable quantities of money requires 
an intricate array of moving parts—committees and 
relationships and luncheons and negotiations and 
sweet-talking fundraising ofﬁcers and whispers about 
tit for tat — that grease the wheels of the system. And 
there is still some element of self-interest in major gifts, 
albeit not the sort of sinister leverage feared in the past. 
Menard remembers a time at an education confer-
ence in Boston when somebody heard that he was an 
advancement ofﬁcer and joked to the people nearby: 
“Stand back folks, and hold onto your wallets!”

“It was a joke, but words like that can be frustrating, 
because they do not seem to realize that people give 
when they want to,” said Menard. “At the end of the 
day, they give to feel good.” 

But the projects undertaken and funded by major 
gifts from Chinese donors seem to show that there are 
goals bigger than personal interests that are driving this 
ﬁnancial machinery. At stake is not just large sums of 
money, but educational goals and the future of U.S.-
China relations. As the Yale Asia Development Coun-
cil member put it, “It is like elephant hunting. You 
have to play the long game.”
