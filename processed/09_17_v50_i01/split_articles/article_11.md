“It sounds like some kind of a cult,” said David Whelan ART ‘12, Reed’s teaching fellow in Auvillar in 2013 and 2014, remembering the program. “But the intensity encourages vulnerability so that participants ﬁnd each other in that vulnerable moment, and depend upon each other throughout the experience.” 

Late at night, tens of drawings into a demanding investigation, we push each other through fatigue, frustration, and moments of doubt. But as Reed keeps reminding us, the program is a rare opportunity to sustain singular focus so intensely. He often uses the analogy of a rubber band: the program’s mission is to help us stretch further than we ever thought we could be stretched. By the end of the program, each one of us made over four hundred pieces of work.

“I will go down in history as the person who took the most seminars with Robert,” Mary Scarvalone told me, laughing. Scarvalone, a Cap d’Antibes-based artist, participated at least once in every one of Reed’s programs after she met him in 1975. The personal and artistic growth spurts that happened in the programs kept her coming back. “Bob gave you the knowledge that you don’t have to be easy on yourself and do the bare minimum. You go through the process of continually working an idea, and working and working it, doing the ﬁfty drawings. As you do them, you discover new things you hadn’t seen before,” she said. The last time Scarvalone worked with Reed was in 2012, in Auvillar. Recently, she and a sculptor friend locked themselves in her studio in Cap d’Antibes, a town on France’s Mediterranean coast, for a three-day weekend of nothing but drawing with the intensity she learned from Reed.

The summer of 2014 was the last year of Reed’s program in Auvillar. That fall, I took his “Introduction to Painting” class at Yale. It was the last time he taught that, too; he was hospitalized intermittently throughout the semester, but he came back immediately each time he was released. In December of that year, Reed passed away at the age of 76.

I had many professors after Reed, but I never, not even after graduating in May this year, stopped looking back at the experience of working with him. After knowing the energy that comes from intense focus and dedication to one’s work, anything less feels inadequate, dishonest. For the Yale Summer Session staff, ﬁnding someone conﬁdent enough to carry the torch and keep the Auvillar program running has proved impossible. Reed’s program was ﬁercely his own, a product of his own lifelong investigation. The following summer, the studio in Auvillar was empty of students. But across the country and the world, the rubber bands continued to stretch.
