EVERY · FRIDAY, before the sun rises,
Dawood Ya-Sin leads one of the five
required daily prayers for 250 Muslims at
Masjid Al-ls]am, a mosque on George
Street. Aside from the prayer itself, he
delivers a message which addresses current
events and an individual's obligation in
today's complex world. He then recites the
Koran aloud while his congregants listen in
bowed meditation.
In post 9-11 America, the word "Islam"
has become linked with "terrorism." Ya-Sin
believes this may be in part due to the
media, which promotes the view that
although "nor every terrorist is a Muslim,
every Muslim is a terrorist or a potential
one." Ya-Sin challenges this stereotype.
When he's not fulfilling his duties as imam
of the George Street mosque, he is a teach-
ing assistant for Yale's first-year Arabic
class, an Islamic chaplain at Yale-New
Haven Hospital and advisor to the Muslim
Students Association. He also runs an
online Muslim clothing store.
Thirteen years ago, a modeling agent
discovered
Ya-Sin
m
Nantucket,
Massachusetts and urged him co attend a
model search in New York City. His port-
folio consisted of two Polaroids taken at the
agency. He was competing with a pool of
professional actors and models, but still he
managed
to
land a
contract with
Wilhelmina Models, one of the largest
model management companies in the busi-
ness. At the time, he says, it was abnormal
to see an African American in a fashion
advertisement. "When I came to New
York, it wasn't like how we see it now," he
recalled. "I didn't let social barriers or racial
barriers or whatever hold me back."
During his five years on the modeling cir-
cuit, Ya-Sin learned to embrace different
cultures, which he says is difficult for most
Americans when they first encounter Islam.
During his five-year modeling career,
Ya-Sin traveled to large cities and answered
questions for teeny-bopper magazines like,
"What's your idea of a perfect date?" "It
was great," he recalls. "You could Ay to the
Bahamas for three days and be paid great
money to work our for an hour at the gym
and shoot a couple of hours." But soon, he
began to grapple with some of his own
questions, questions whose answers would
never appear in the pages of a teen maga-
zine: "Where is the underlying spirituality
in my life?" "What is there after twenty
photo shoots?" Ya-Sin decided to leave his
modeling career as quickly as he had
8
entered it. While in South Africa, Ya-Sin
began practicing Islam, in hopes of filling a
void in his life.
It was the simplicity and modesty of
Islam that first piqued Ya-Sin's interest.
"God is God and everything else is creation
underneath it. There is no intermediary
between you and your Creator," he said.
During his conversion, Ya-Sin found it dif-
ficult to pray five times daily and simulta-
neously satisfy the demands of modeling.
"We were doing a commercial in South
Africa and this one cake we did like fifty
times and the time was coming that I had
ro pray and [prayer] cakes precedence over
that," he said. "The makeup artist is upset;
the lighting person is upset at you. There
was all of that going on and I was like, you
know what? It's not worth it." So in 1996,
after five years in the business, Ya-Sin trad-
ed in his beauty entourage, designer cloth-
ing, and half-fare plane tickets, to come
home, and join a mosque in Providence,
Rhode Island. The following year he made
a hajj, or pilgrimage, with a group from
this mosque. Upon their return, the group
offered to sponsor his study of Arabic and
Islamic sciences for eight years· in Syria.
Keeping to his "if I like something I'll do
it" attitude, he decided ro go.
While in Syria, Ya-Sin studied lan-
guage and theology for as many as 16 hours
a day. At the school where he studied, he
also met his wife, a fellow Muslim
American, who was also earning her degree
in the Islamic Sciences. Dawood's studies,
though, were cut short by the terrorist
attacks on September n, 2001. Although he
had completed only four and a half years of
study, his family asked that he return back
to the States. But the transition back to
American life was not easy. Towing his
stack of Modern Arabic textbooks and with
a cell phone earpiece dangling from his ear
as he works out clothing orders, he does
not let the differences slow him down. Yet
he is aware of the stereotypes nor only from
newspaper headlines but also from his daily
experiences. He has been the target of
obscene gestures and shouts of, "Go back
to your country." These are ironic words
for Ya-Sin, who has returned to his country
only to find that the discrimination he
once encountered because of his skin color
is now based on his wardrobe.
With his traditional kufi cap and
beard, Ya-Sin often feels that he looks mys-
terious and even dangerous to stereotyping
Americans. He realius his students may
also be influenced by his appearance, so he
often tells the story of his modeling career,
world travels and conversion to Islam.
"Sometimes I feel char, you know, you kind
of walk in with a beard, with your head
covered and you're only in [class] couple of
days a week. You're kind of a shady figure,"
he says. Meshing his two primary occupa-
tions, he has worked to change the image
of an unapproachable Western Muslim-
"shady figure" -to a respected and revered
religious one. In 2001, he, his wife, and five
others opened an online marker called
Shukr, or "gratitude" in Arabic, that sells
contemporary Islamic clothing . The web-
site addressed a need Ya-Sin himself felt:
"You know I don't want my wife co wear a
burkha (a headpiece covering everything
but the area around one's eyes). And I don't
want to wear traditional clothing for some-
one
from
Ko
Racha.
I'm
from Ko Racha. I'm from Nantucket,
Massachusetts, but I'm a Muslim," he said.
Even as he cries to break out of the
unflattering
mold
which
many
Americans place Muslims, Ya-Sin is
grounded by Islam and his daily prayers.
His efforts are focused not on single-hand-
edly reversing stereotypes but on his daily
commitments. He keeps the same jovial,
optimistic attitude char he had when he
was once swept away with the excitement
of a modeling career. Although Ya-Sin now
answers more questions about verb-tense
than about perfect dates, he finds this life
more worthwhile: "It's not like rea-eational
volleyball...like if you don't show up it's not
important. I'll be missed."
