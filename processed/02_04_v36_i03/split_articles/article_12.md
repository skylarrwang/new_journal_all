AFTER THE
A
FTER SIX MONTHS OF HEATED CONTROVERSY, New Haven's 
last local lender fmally won City Hall's approval to go public. 
Since New Haven Savings Bank (NHSB) first announced its 
plan in July to acquire two other area banks and to become a pub-
licly held company, protest from the community has dragged the 
bank into a battle over depositors' rights, personal greed, and dis-
criminatory lending practices. Leading the charge against the merg-
er was Mayor John DeStefano who until a few weeks ago claimed it 
would compromise the bank's ability to serve local customers. 
Then, on January 26, events took a surprising turn. DeStefano 
greeted a crowd of bank supporters and press cameras in the lobby 
of the bank's main branch on Church Street to announce a com-
promise that would permit the merger-but only if New Haven 
were cut in on the deal. 

City Hall's blessing did not come cheap. As part of the agree-
ment, New Haven Savings Bank will contribute $40 million from 
the conversion to its own charitable fund, $25 million of which will 
go to the Independent Foundation, a fund that will be "focused on 
New Haven" and administered by a combination of city, bank, and 
community representatives. In the event that NewAllianq: {the 
bank's post-conversion moniker} fails to maintain its commitment 
to the local community, the Independent Foundation board can use 
the money to found a new mutual savings bank. The bank has also 
committed $27.5 million to a program dubbed "NewAlliance for 
Neighborhoods." Intended to serve the interests of working class 
families and inner-city neighborhoods, it will allocate an addition-
al $6 million for loans to low and moderate-income borrowers at 
less than 2 percent interest. According to bank chairman, president, 
and CEO Peyton Patterson, NewAlliance for Neighborhoods is 
intended to demonstrate the bank's "unwavering support for home 
ownership in greater New Haven, specifically working-class citizens 
and small, independent businesses." 

Considering that as a private institution, NHSB does not legally 
need approval from the city or the community to proceed with the 
conversion, it is certainly shelling out a lot of money just to silence 
City Hall. {DeStefano's part of the bargain includes a five-year gag 
order, during which time he cannot speak out against NHSB, pro-
vided it upholds its half of the agreement.) After all, the bank 
already has the approval of Connecticut Banking Commissioner 
John Burke, and thus needs only federal approval to proceed with 
the conversion at the end of March. And though City Hall is now 
willing to hold its tongue, many community groups are not, mean-
ing NewAlliance Bank might need to do more than throw money 
around to keep its customers happy. 

FOR ANYONE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE NHSB controversy, the 
bank's plan to acquire Connecticut Bankshares Inc. and 
Alliance Bancorp of New England (the holding companies for 
two other area banks, Savings Bank of Manchester and Tolland) 
might seem shrewd, though not entirely unexpected. After all, 18 
other hometown banks have been bought out in the last 20 years. 
Every other local mutual bank has been converted, and 75 percent 
of those converted banks have been bought out by publit:ly owned 
conglomerates (think Walmart-style franchise banking). From a 
business standpoint, it does not seem unreasonable that the Board 
of Directors and President of NHSB might follow suit. 

New Haven Savings Bank chairman, president, and CEO Peyton 
Patterson has repeatedly cited NHSB's weak position relative to other 
banks in the market as the reason for the proposed acc;luisition and 
conversion. "New Ha~en Savings Bank assets have grown 50 per-
cent less than other banks in Connecticut, in the last four years .. · ·
