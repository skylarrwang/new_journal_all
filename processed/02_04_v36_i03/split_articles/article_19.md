DEPOT IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA, police arrest a 
woman for trespassing. They take her down 
the station, along with all of her worldly belongings, car-
ned in a few tattered shopping bags. She spends seven months in 
jail, one month longer than the maximum state sentence for tres-
passing. In the early morning hours, she leaves the prison, located 
in an industrial area of Atlanta, in the same prcdicunent in which 
she began-alone and with nowhere to spend the night. That 
morning, she is picked up by men who rape her repeatedly. Today, 
she is HIV positive. 

"You really only needed to spend one minute with her to know 
what was wrong with her, â€¢ rccalled Stephen Bright of the Southern 
Center for Human Rights at a Davenport College Master' s tea ear-
lier this month. Bright deplores the system that arrests people 
whose problem is not criminal deviance. 

Currendy, the largest mental health institution in the United 
States is our prison system. According to a report published less 
than a year ago by the University of Massachusetts at Boston, men-
tal illness is five times more prevalent in prison than in society. One 
in six inmates is mentally ill. Many advocates think these statistics 
may signal a disturbing trend: the criminalization of mental illness.
