so much ... : It was a revelation. It had 
taken me over a year to decide to quit my 
job at City Ballet and explore modem 
dance. But when I finally left, I didn't want 
to look back. I was convinced I had taken 
my pointe shoes off for good; to me, 
they now represented the artificiality 
of the technique, and the conformity 
of a huge ballet company. 

I decided to become a "modern 
dancer" partly because I no longer 
wanted to subject myself to the strict 
and uniform environment that surrounds
ballet. I love the elegance of 
classical dance, and the way my body 
feels executing the steps. But I do not 
agree with the way large ballet institutions
are run. 

Initially, dancers 
show up at work every day because 
they love the art form. But then that 
joy of dancing gets trampled under 
weight pressure, petty political games, 
and demeaning treatment. At City 
Ballet, we were rarely commended for 
our work. The only feedback was 
advice for those teetering above the 
prescribed weight limit: "Get thin or 
don't dance." The ballet masters and 
mistresses have been through the system
themselves and perpetuate the 
subtle mind games and humiliating 
casting and coaching they have learned. 

While I experienced a handful of career 
highs there, most of my energy was 
focused on just trying to survive. We 
danced underweight, exhausted, and 
mentally broken down much of the 
time; and yet we were admonished for not 
"looking like we were trying ... At the point 
that I left it just didn't seem worth it any-
more, to fight that hard for my self-
esteem---even for the privilege of dancing 
gorgeous George Balanchine and Jerome 
Robbins ballets. Leaving City Ballet was 
an act of self-salvation; I dove under my 
imaginary piano to get away from the psy-
chological abuse a ballet company imposes 
on its dancers. 

After City Ballet I worked for four 
years with Mikhail Baryshnikov's modern 
dance company, White Oak Dance Project, 
and then joined Twyla Tharp Dance in 
2002. Twyla's choreography consists of a 
pastiche of movement. Ballet, Graham, jit-
terbug, yoga, and basketball, are just a few 
of the random styles that end up in her 
pieces. My dancing experience with White 
Oak was more intellectually than physical-
ly challenging; it felt good to return to bal-
let, this time through Twyla's hybrid chore-
ography. I was still certain, however, that I 
would never wear pointe shoes again. But 
Twyla is a persuasive woman. When she 
said, "Okay, so you're going to learn this 
duet. You have all that classical Balanchine 
technique. You have to use it," I decided 
not to sit down with her, as if she were a 
therapist, and explain: "You see Twyla, 
these shoes represent repression to me .... " 
I simply started working in them again. 
The challenge of returning to a skill I had 
once mastered appealed to me. I per-
formed the duet and surprisingly really 
enjoyed it. 

After learning 
that dance could be liberating, 
the shoes no longer bore 
the stigma that I had attached 
to them. They were just 
shoes. 

I realized in the middle 
of teaching my New Haven 
pointe 
class 
this 
past 
September that there is one 
thing I don't know how to 
convey to my students: the 
idea of anarchy. 
Learn the 
rules, but then make them 
your own, push them to an 
extreme, even break them. 
Anarchy in art does not mean 
free-form self-expression, or 
outpouring. Anarchy is the 
tension between the individuality
of the artist and the 
artist's firm understanding of 
the rules. 

Ballet is a highly 
technical art form, and striving
for perfection is a necessary
aspect of the ballet medium. 
But at the same time, perfect
technique can be boring. 
Often, it is the dancer's idiosyncrasies
or weaknesses that resonate. 

By these, I mean the 
individual's choices as to what 
she willingly does or does not choose to 
accept regarding the rules. 
A dancer is 
more interesting to me when she hasn't had 
all of her choices groomed out of her. 

I give one last combination before the 
pointe class ends for the evening---walks 
on pointe from the back of the room to the 
front. You have to cross each fifth position 
as you move forward on pointe, and delicately
set, not slam, one toe in front of the 
other. I give them the option to choose the 
port de bras, the positions and arrangement 
of their arms. The music starts, and they 
hop up on their blocks. Staring at them-
selves in the mirror, they forget to port de 
bras gracefully. One student's fingers jut 
out stiffly. I mention that she might want 
to think about the way she's holding her 
arms in second, the next time around. She 
nods. Another student is dancing well, so 
I tell her, "Excellent, good." I can see when 
they aren't focusing, and I can see when 
they really apply their minds to the correc-
tions. 

And then I can see when they've for-
gotten everything except the feeling of 
dancing. This doesn't happen often in an 
intermediate ballet class, but when it does, 
it's beautiful to observe. They stop process-
ing my ideas, and start coming up with 
their own. I shout, "The floor is YOURS 
-CREATE something out of this exercise!" 
in hopes of seeing that kind of hunger, that 
willful desire to make a personal impact on 
a staid, centuries-old art form. A few of 
them perk up and throw themselves into 
the steps with more energy. But there are 
others in the back of the studio just hanging
out, not paying attention. My words 
float in the air. They are too busy master-
ing the basics to consider a revolt.
