EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Department, a new YPD sub-station recent-
ly opened near Yale-New Haven Hospital 
in what is technically the Hill neighbor-
hood, and construction is slated to begin 
this spring at the department's new head-
quarters on Lock Street in the Dixwell 
neighborhood. 


Still, the YPD officer-to-resident ratio is 
considerably higher than that of the New 
Haven Police, who have about 400 sworn 
officers spread out across a city of 123,000. 
The YPD, therefore, often responds to 
crimes that the New Haven police may not 
'have time to cover. A typical YPD weekly 
log, printed in the Yale Bulletin, reads like a 
lirany of the state's most minor offenses: 
"breach of the peace," "drug possession," 
"trespassing." According to Administrative 
Lieutenant Michael Patten, motor vehicle 
violations like the one for which Marta was 
stopped are a lower priority, but still a reg-
ular part of a patrol officer's duty. 


Even so, YPD arrests assert the depart-
ment's presence in the community. Crime 
in New Haven, particularly in the vicinity 
of Yale, has fallen considerably in the last 
decade, reducing· New Haven's reputation 
as an unsafe place for students to live. But 
the lower crime rate has come at a cost. A 
growing number of students and commu-
nity members complain that the increase in 
law enforcement has diminished New 
Haven residentS' sense of comfort on cam-
pus. The YPD, its critics contend, srands out 
among other urban police departmentS for 
itS chronic racial-profiling, disrespect for 
the people it detains or questions, and most 
frequently, for its disparate treatment of 
those who are affiliated with Yale and those 
who are not. In the eyes of the Yale Police, 
says one student, a Yale 10 card is "like a 
free pass." 


Last year, members of the Student 
Legal Action Movement (sLAM) were so 
outraged by charges of Yale bias that they 
began monitoring the YPD police log and 
collecting anecdotes of mistreatment at the 
hands ofYale police officers. Their co!'ldu-
sion, according to current SLAM member 
Ikponmwosa Ekunwe SY 'o6, was that the 
arrestS appeared to be a thinly veiled pre-
tense for forcing city residents .off campus. 
"I even saw someone arrested for littering," 
Ekunwe recalled recently. "These are just 


obvious sorts of intimidation tactics, intim~ 
idating people from coming to campus." 


Yale students guilty of the same petty 
offenses, she added, are almost always 
ignored by the department. 


Given the starkly different racial com-
positions of the university community and 
the city-only 12.5 percent ofYale students 
identify themselves as black or Hispanic 
compared to over half of the city's popula-
tion-the charge of non-Yale bias among 
Yale police officers frequently translates 
into an accusation of racial bias as well. 


In 
researching 
the 
relationship 
resolved when the student showed the offi-
cer his Yale 10. Encounters like this, the 
professor says, have led some minority stu-
dents and even faculty at Yale to don Yale 
paraphernalia and wear their 10 cards 
around their necks in an attempt to stave 
off potential harassment. 


The Yale Police, for their part, deny 
any accusations of bias. In a recent email, 
Chief of Pol~ce James Perrotti wrote, "The 
idea that we practice selective enforcement 
is not true. Our services are provided co 
both affiliated and non-affiliated persons ... 
Treating non-affiliated persons with a dif-
"If you're in a residential college and you 
don't belong there-you're not a member 
of the community-you're liable to come 
to our attention." He rejects the charge that 
University affiliation would be determined 
by race, since the YPD officially opposes 
racial profiling as both unethical and inef-
fective. Still, in a moment of candor, he did 
agree that students are less likely to commit 
crimes than other people in the city. 


"There's a big screening process they go 
through to get in here," he explained. 


Chief Perrotti points our, though, that 
the YPD will investigate charges of miscon-
duct brought by anyone in 
the community-not just 
Yale students. Yet when it 
comes to disagreeing with the 
law, there may be no such 
thing as an even playing field. 


between Yale police and Yale 
undergraduates for her senior 
thesis in sociology, Jessica Price 
J£'04 has found that students of 
color, on average, have a drasti-
cally lower opinion of the Yale 
Police than white students-
even accounting for differences 
in socio-economic background 
and previous experiences with 
law enforcement. T he sense of 
personal affront is not unfound-
ed. Among Price's respondents, 
black and Hispanic students are 
more likely to have had a serious 
and negative interaction with 
the Yale Police than other stu-
dents. For most of these stu-
dents, the interrogation ended as 
soon as they produced a Yale ID. 
In the case of one black student 
whom Price interviewed, the 
Yale Police stopped him as he 
entered a residential college, and 
when he didn't have an ID to 
support his claim that he was a 
student visiting a friend, they 
"Anybody who looks Hke they 
don't belong on the Yale campus 
is going to be subject to some 
level of harrassment." 


M 
arta was not the first 
person in her neigh-
borhood to lose her 
consular ID card to a pol\ce 
officer. She knows four others 
who have had theirs taken as 
well, by police in New Haven 
and 
elsewhere · 
m 
Connecticut. Losing a con-
sular ID is a big deal. "A 
Consular ID is the only cre-
dential that we have," she 
explained. "I registered my 
car with it; I opened my bank 
account with it. And now I 
don't have any form of identi-
fication." Without it, Marta 
cannot wire money from her 
bank account, nor prove her 
escorted him to his friend's room and made 
the friend identify him as a fellow Yale stu-
dent. 


One Yale professor, who prefers not to 
be named, recalls when Yale police officers 
thtew a former student against a wall 
because they were looking for someone fit-
ting his description-
a Hispanic male. As 
with the other incidents, t1Us one was 
ferent standard would be a violation of our 
values." Lieutenant Parten put it more suc-
cinctly: "It's behavior; that's what differen-
tiates whether a police officer is going to 
approach you. It's what you're doing, not 
who you are." In the case of trespassing, 
Lieutenant Parten says that no one is 
stopped just for being in public spaces such 
as the University's libraries. But, he added, 
identity should she be stopped again. 


Replacing the 10 will require upwards of six 
weeks, a trip to the Mexican Consulate in 
New York City, and an original Mexican 
birth certificate. Because she has only a 
photocopy of her birth certificate here, 
Marta must wait for her family in Mexico 
to mail her the original before she can 
make the trek co New York. 


Despite 
the difficulty of 
obtaining a new ID, Marta agreed 
with her neighbors that the alterna-
tive-asking the police to return her 
old one--was not worth the risk. But 
one of her employers had an idea that 
might help. Marta could take her com-
plaint to Junta, a non-profit agency on 
Grand Avenue that serves New Haven's 
Hispanic community. Marta took the 
advice, and to good effect: the Executive 
Director of Junta, Kica Matos, took 
Marta's.complaim vety seriously, calling it 
part of a larger trend of Yale police mis-
trcatmmt that is obscured by immigrants' 
typical ret.icence when it comes to chal-
lenging law enforcement. 


"The number of complaints against 
the Yale Police has risen in the last few 
months," Matos said in a recent interview. 
The explanation is unclear: it could be sim-
ply that as word spreads that Junta can 
help, more people are bringing their com-
plaints to the organization's attention. 


Their experience with police in their home 
countries and their fear of deportation, 
Matos says, can keep immigrants from 
questioning police authority and even from 
putting faith in the Junta staff. 


But Matos suspects the rise in com-
plaints may also reflect a larger pattern of 
Yale police officers' prejudice against peo-
ple from outside the Yale community. In 
her view, "Anybody who looks like they 
don't belong [on the Yale campus] is going 
to be subject to some level of harassment." 


In an effort to address the rise in com-
plaints-and hopefuUy secure the return of 
Marta's 11>-Matos requested a meeting 
with a YPD officer. In January, Lt. Patten 
went to the Junta office to discuss Marta's 
case. The meeting went better than Matos 
had expected. Lt. Patten explained that 
although the YPD did not have Marta's 10, 
he would be happy to write a letter to the 
Mexican Consulate on Mana's behalf to try 
to expedite the replacement process. He 
abo ofkred to share the information that 
Maros provided about consular ro cards 
with the rest of the Yale Police Department. 


Later, 
L 
t 
Pa tte n 
said the meet-
ing 
was 
not 
unusual: "We try to 
resolve issues as they 
come up so everything that 
happens doesn't necessarily go through a 
formal complaint process. We try to work 
things out ... The whole idea is for people 
get along." 


But according to SLAM members and 
other critics of the YPD, there is no substi-
tute for a strong, formal complaint process. 
According to Captain Bonnie Winchester, 
Public Information Officer for the New 
Haven Police, the NHPD, like most urban 
police departments, has officers on staff 
who sole job is to review complaints. In the 
Yale department, there are too few officers 
to accommodate such a disjuncture. 


Ekunwe from SLAM points out that this 
under-staffing means that complaintants 
could find themselves in the uncomfortable 
position of having to file their grievances 
with the supervisor of the offending officer, 
or with another officer with whom they 
have had an encounter on the street. It is an 
imperfect system, one for which easy reme-
dies do not exist. 


I 
n filet, the remedy, like the problem, may 
not lie with the ·YPD at all. According to 
Lt. Patten, when a Yale police officer 
approaches 
a 
"suspicious 
per-
son" it is often at 
the behest of a 
Yale student or 
faculty 
member. 
Patten is not alone 
in his thinking-
even those most mis-
trustful of the ypd rec-
ognize the role Yale 
community 
members 
play in keeping racial bias 
alive. Ekunwe and slam both 
report instances when a feUow 
student or, in one case, a college 
master called the Yale police to 
report the presence of a suspicious 
black male. Each time, when the ypd 
showed up, the black male in question 
turned out to be a student. 


Anecdotal accounts of racist encoun-
ters also support the idea that any racist 
action taken by the police parallels exclu-
sion within the Yale community. One 
Hispanic professor recalls a time when he 
tried to enter a residential college behind a 
student who turned to him once inside the 
gate and asked, "Can I help you?" The pro-
fessor responded angrily, "No. Can I help 
you?" Another student of his, an Afro-
Cuban living in Timothy Dwight college, 
was once approached by a Yalie who want-
ed to know what he was doing in the laun-
dry room, as if his laundry hamper and 
dirty clothes did not suffice as an explana-
tion. Stories like this support Matos's con-
tention that racial and university-centric 
bias on the part of the Yale Police may sim-
ply reflect a larger pattern of prejudice in 
the University community. As the Yale pro-
fessor put it: "It is a fact that th~e are not 
many Hispanic people here and there is a 
perception that the ones that are here are 
only cleaning toilets and floors." 


Whatever the reason for the prejudice, 
many members ofYale's activist and cultur-
al communities worry that the perception 
of mistreatment by Yale Poliee officers is 
building a wall around the University with
