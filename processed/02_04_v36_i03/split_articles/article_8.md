graduation, Goldman got a job in
Bethesda, Maryland, and Nalebuff contin-
ued to teach business students. The conver-
sation about un-sweetened beverages
seemed fleeting and forgotten until
Goldman
called
Nalebuff in 1997 with a
proposal for Honest
Tea, an organic, natural-
ly sweetened tea that is
not
too
sweet.
Conveniently, Nalebuff
had just returned from a
research trip jn India, where he
had been studying the tea indus-
try. Nalebuff liked the idea, and
the following year, the duo started
Honest Tea in Bethesda. Once
Honest Tea got on its feet,
Goldman and Nalebuff began
using Fair Trade tea leaves and
collaborating with small tea grow-
ers around the world.
In India, Nalebuff drank a lot
of very good tea, and realized the
tea Americans drink is very bad. American
tea companies purchase cheap, low-quality
dust and fannings
what is left over after
the quality tea has been produced.
Furthermore,
most
Americans,
in
Nalebuff's opinion, don't even know what
good tea tastes like.

Honest Tea, on the other hand, is the
good stuff, made only with whole leaf tea. -
His drink, Nalebuff explains, is as sophisti-
cated as wine. "Wine tasters can drink
white wine, red wine, or pink wine," he
explains. Then there are choices between
Merlot, Pinot Noir, and other varieties of
wine that depend on the kind of grape in
the vineyard. Wine changes from year to
year, from locale to locale, and from season
to season. Tea is no different. It has an
equally broad spectrum, with a range of
choices from green to black, from oolong
to brick, from white to scented. Within
each of the major classifications, a number
of factors distinguish tastes: the type of leaf,
the season or "flush" in which the tea is
picked, the temperature of water in which
the tea is steeped, and even the source of

Despite his trip to India, and ·his
impeccable taste, Nalebuff insists that he
does not enjoy tea any more than the next
beverage drinker. Honest Tea simply com-
plements his daily activi-
ties. Nalebuff has taped
a
large
Honest Tea
poster
onto
the
crammed bookshelf in
his office. The closet is
full of Honest Tea bot-
tles of all flavors, and the
small fridge is packed with more
bottles. Next to the fridge is a
large cardboard display stand for
Honest. Tea bags. Nalebuff only
spent one chapter on Honest Tea
in his recently published book
Why Not?. He usually discusses his
company in one lecture of each
semester-long class, but otherwise
does not announce his involve-
ment with Honest Tea to his stu-
dents.

Nalebuff and Goldman have happily
settled into their place as tea manufactur-
ers. The trick, Nalebuff stresses, is knowing
what you can and cannot do. Retail is not
for these two; they manufacture and sell tea
wholesale, but they have no interest in
becoming the Starbucks of good tea.
·Nalebuff knows that not all good ideas
are good businesses. Honest Tea just hap-
pened to work. And as Nalebuff bluntly
puts it, "Honest Tea just tastes good."
