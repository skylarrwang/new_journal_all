T his is not a viable long term strategy." In fact, in recent years NHSB 
has grown only 2. 77 percent compared to an average of eight per-
cent growth at other banks. Wachovia, with over rwice as much 
money in deposits as NHSB, has the top market share in New Haven 
with 36 percent of all deposits, including the city of New Haven's 
money, despite the fact that NHSB has nearly three times as many 
branches in the area. "To have a competitive advantage that is sus-
tainable, to have a competitive advantage. that is 1ong term, we 
knew we had to make a change," Patterson insisted to a group of 
stony-faced protesters at a public hearing at the Hamden Memorial 
Complex in December. When the conversion is complete, the new 
bank will boast 73 branches, up from 36, and $5.3 billion in assets, 
up from $2.4 billion. Statewide it will be the second largest savings 
bank and fifth largest bank overall, holding the ftft:h largest share of 
the market. And all this before the bank even puts its stock up for 
sale. 

The acquisition is slated to cost $677 million, approximately 
250 percent above book value. But the conversion to a publicly held 
company will more than cover the cost of the acquisition. In addi-
tion to $33 million in break up fees from the other banks, the bank 
will be sold for $10 a share and is expected to generate $86o million 
in revenue. The depositors, employees, and board members will 
have the first opportunity to buy stock in the bank in descending 
order. After that the public will be allowed to buy in. There is a clear 
incentive for investors to buy the shares, because, more often than 
not, a mom-and-pop bank that goes public is quickly bought out 
fÂ£BRUARY 2004 
by a Bank of America or Wachovia, and the stock skyrockets in 
value. 

But this incentive failed to bring the bank's depositors much joy, 
probably because they were denied a vote in the process. Because 
the depositors are, by defin ition, the owners of a mutual savings 
bank, some account holders argue that they should be given the 
right to vote on the conversion and proposed acquisition. Others 
worry that the proposed conversion is driven by greed, not necessi-
ty, as it has been billed by Patterson. According to some critics, the 
biggest strike against the bank was that New Haven Savings Bank 
was designed to be a community lender and this change would 
inevitably mean a deviation from its original mission. In the bank's 
conversion plan, the only assurance that it will maintain a local 
focus is Patterson's word and a five-year anti-takeover stipulation. 
The bank is safeguarded against being bought out until 2008, at 
which rime the protection expires. "No one is foolish enough not to 
expect a takeover, "State Representative Cameron Staples said. And 
even if the bank were not taken over, like 75 percent of its prede-
cessors, there is no assurance that the bank will remain invested in 
New Haven. 

The backlash has been more intense than the bank's executives 
could have foreseen. With DeStefano at the helm, and several local 
activist groups on board, including Connecticut Center for a New 
Economy (CCNE), Elm City Congregations O rganized (Ecco) and
