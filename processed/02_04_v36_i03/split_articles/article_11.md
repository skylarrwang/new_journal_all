rarely this observant, they rely on patterns they have memorized 
instead of being on the lookout for new ones. 

But despite residents' initial tendencies to overlook the uncom-
mon (or, in Friedlaender's case, the seemingly obvious), Dr. 
Braverman observes, "After they're on their own for about five 
years-they suddenly get how to see things on their own." The 
observation that young doctors eventually developed sophisticated 
observational skills on their own indicated a curricular gap. Medical 
schools have always acknowledged the importance of visual obser-
vation, says Dr. Braverman, 
but they never knew how to 
teach it. "They just assumed 
you could do it if you were 
smart, and no one did any for-
mal instruction on visual 
observation," he says. But visu-
al 
observation 
could 
be 
learned, and was being learned 
by doctors independent of 
their medical school training. 
"So the question for me then 
was: how can they get the skill 
· sooner?" 

began to see concrete results: "The first-year studentS were doing 
better than the second-year studentS." 

To the veteran professor, it seemed that a new method of med-
ical school training had been discovered. 

T
hree years after the auspicious beginnings of Dr. Braverman's 
program, Linda Friedlaender leads me on a tour of the paint-
ings that can teach doctors to be sleuths. Our first stop is a 
large portrait of a woman arranging some flowers in vases, "Mrs. 
James Guthrie" by Frederic, 
Lord Leighton. "I only use 
Victorian narrative paintings, 
filled with details. They're 
meant to read like a novel in 
paint," Friedlaender explains. 
"I didn't want to use an 
abstract painting with a blue 
canvas and an orange dot." 

Friedlaender tells the stu-
dents to study a painting 
without reading the explana-
tory panel that accompanies 
it. This allows students to 
mentally catalogue every fea-
ture in the painting. After 15 
minutes, the students recon-
vene to discuss their findings. 
"I actually had one stu-
dent describe this painting 
and say nothing about the 
flowers. I said, 'Would you 
like to say anything about 
what's in her hand?' "The ten-
dency of the students is to skip 
the step of observation and 
leap straight to analysis, and it 
is Ms. Friedlaender's task to 
slow them down. "Someone 
will say, 'She's removing the 
flower because it' s dead,' and 
I'll say, 'That's a judgment. I 
want details.' Then they'll say, 
~ight, well it looks wrinkled, 
and it's brown.' B;:i"t then 

he idea that medical stu-
dents might improve 
their observational skills 
by 
studying 
paintings 
occurred, as overdue ideas 
sometimes do, to two people at 
more or less the same time. In 
this case it also occurred to two 
people in the same place. Over 
Thanksgiving 
of 
1997, 
Braverman struck upon the 
idea that maybe if he showed 
the studentS " a foreign object," 
they could practice their skills 
on it. "And actually 'painting' 
was the first thing that popped 
into my head," he adds with a 
chuckle, "because I thought 
that might be the most foreign 
object a medical student might 
ever encounter." 

someone might point out that 
she might be adding the 
flower to give variety to the 
bouquet. First we get the 
details, then we generate all possibilities of what they mean." 

Dr. Braverman took a few 
residentS to the Yale Center for 
British Axt and made them 
study the minute details of narrative paintings. Within a few weeks, 
the residentS already seemed to be better at diagnosing skin rashes. 

Not all patterns or details have a significant meanil\g. just as a 
patient's symptoms aren't all necessarily indicative of a particular 
disease. "Unless one day we turn the painting over and see that Lord 
Leighton wrote, 'In this painting Mrs. Guthrie is removing dead 
flowers,' we'll never really know. And the bottom line, in this case," 


she adds, lowering her voice, "is that the artist probably just want-
ed to give her something to do." 

The program is about disciplining oneself to recognize all a 
painting' s features--not to show off how one can spin these fea-
tures into a fanciful diagnosis. The skills a resident learns in the 
museum will benefit both doctors and patients back in the examin-
ing room. 

On Friedlaender's desk is a small decorative sign reading, 
"When you hear hoof beats, don't look for zebras." She looks 
amused and says, " I take that to 
mean, when something's obvious, 
don't read more into it." 

The Yale School of Medicine 
gave 
Dr. 
Braverman and Ms. 
Friedlaender's fine arts program 
informal approval in 1998. A year 
later, a dermatology student named 
Jacqueline Dolev, who was working 
on her thesis project, asked its 
founders if she could run a scientific 
study of the program's efficacy. 
Together, the three developed a sys-
tem of pre- and post-testing, where-
in students examined photographs 
of skin diseases immediately prior 
to and just after the museum visits. 

The skills a resident 
learns in the museum 
will benefit both doctors 
and patients in the 
examtntng room. 

The team collected data for 
two years, and in September of 
2001, Th~ Journal of th~ Ammcan 
M~dical Association published the 
study. The students involved in the 
fine arts program showed an 
improvement of ten percent in their 
observational skills--a statistically 
significant increase. Today, Yale 
requires its first year medical stu-
dents to take the course. "We got 
reams 
publicity," 
says 
Friedlaender. "We were on TV in 
Washington, it went over the AP, we got all kinds of calls, there was 
a big article in the Nnu l'Ork Ttm~s. Someone said he would get us 
on 'Good Morning America.'" 

Though Friedlaender and Braverman never did go on morning 
television, their program has spread across the country. Today, Dr. 
Braverman triumphandy exclaims, "Other schools have adopted 
the program, in whole or in part: Brown, Stanford, Tulane, 
University of California Irvine, Duke, Cornell ... ". 

Many of the medical schools that incorporated the program 
into their curricula have acted with the intention of making med-
ical students more well-rounded, not just better observers. Some 
schools speculate that exposure to art will nurture a young doctor-
ro-be's heart as well as his mind. 

"There has been a real proliferation of courses in medical 
schools dealing with medicine and the humanities, • says 
Friedlaender. (Yale, for instance, runs an optional lecture series on 
the humanities in medicine with such tides as "The Muses: Health 
and Illness" and " Artists Paint the Black Plague." ) "Some schools 
are doing this as a way to humanize the medical system, to help 
doctors become more empathetic. What we do has nothing to do 
with that." The artwork she and Dr. Braverman use is selected not 
for its artistic value but for its visual detail-hence the heavy 
reliance on narrative painting. 

As Friedlaender is quick to point out, the fine art program is 
not about "rounding out" the medical 
student or putting the student in 
touch with his artistic side. This is a 
program solely about the art of dose 
observation, about enhancing the 
capacity to compute visual details. In 
short, it is about brainwork. 

But, as Dr. Braverman explained, 
the program is meant to do more than 
improve powers of analysis. It is also 
about putting the doctor-in-training 
in touch with a more human side of 
the doctor-patient relationship. He 
adds that although it may not 
heighten their artistic appreciation, 
it will help doctors attend to their 
patients in a more personal way. 

His voice takes on a tone of 
urgency as he explains, "If you just 
spend the time examining the 
patient... the patients know when 
you are paying attention to them-
we' re talking about visual observa-
tion now, but also listening, touch-
ing, this applies to all rnculties of 
observation-the patients 
then 
know you are concerned about 
them, and they will trUSt you. And 
they' ll actually do what you pre-
scribe them to do--and they' U get 
better! As opposed to those who won't trust a doctor, won' t take the 
medicine, shop around ... And I think that this develops a wonder-
ful patient-physician bond." 

In the eyes of Ms. Friedlaender and Dr. Braverman, observing 
patients with an eye for detail is not just the sign of a competent 
doctor, but a doctor who cares. As Dr. Braverman puts it, "There's 
looking at and there's seeing. Anyone can look, but how many can 
actually see?"
