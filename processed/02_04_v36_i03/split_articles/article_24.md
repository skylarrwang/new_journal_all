American Woman: A Novel by Susan Choi (Harper 
2003) -
Accidental Asian, at times a personal memoir and at others a 
social commentary, works in a different, but equally effective way. 
Liu's approach from the onset is to challenge the norm. He remem-
bers wanting to defy stereotypes that typified all Asians as "indeli-
bly foreign, exotic, math and science geeks, numbers people rather 
than people people, followers and not leaders, physically frail but 
devious and sneaky, unknowable and potentially treacherous." Liu 
rose above these stereotypes to become, what he felt, was an" atyp-
ical" Asian. He majored in history, refused to be " pigeonholed" (as 
he believed it to be then) by joining any of the numerous Asian 
organizations, and married a redhead. Still, Liu realizes now, in his 
extreme desire to be different he managed to "turn the very key that 
lock[ed] [him] inside," rather than extricate himself from a stereo-
type. In Accidental Asian, however, Liu reconcile these two desires: 
While he admits to rebelling against the prescribed social norms, he 
studied history because he enjoyed it, married his white wife 
because he loved her, and wrote this book not to berate Asian 
America, but to convey a sense of his past and his subsequent hopes 
for the future. 

In one of the book's most moving passages, Liu recalls finding 
Hank Williams lyrics in his father's shirt pocket a year after his 
death from kidney failure. Scrawled in his "familiar penmanship," 
the lyrics read, "I'm so lonesome I could cry." And while Liu's 
depiction of this side of his father is essential to the book, it's cru-
cial that Liu doesn't dwell on this sad, often lonely transition from 
East to West. Liu chooses to focus not on past difficulties, but on 
the here and now. For instance, he emphasizes his father's affable 
nature 
how he scaled the corporate ladder, his boisterous way of 
joking with his non-Mandarin speaking friends, his general like-
ability, and refusal to be held back or put down. Liu is quick to 
emphasize that, save for a few instances in junior high, he has real-
ly never been downright oppressed solely on the basis of his race, 
and " was sometimes uncomfortable, but never really alienated." 

Aside from his diminutive height, and his inability to feather his 
hair look like the " closed wings of angels," he'd never truly felt 
alienated, which is probably true of many of today's Asian 
Americans. Liu recalls arriving at Yale feeling like an outsider, not 
simply because he was a " small Chinese boy standing at a giant 
WASP temple," but because of both " color and class ... twisted 
together in a double helix of felt inadequacy." Liu eventually dealt 
with his intimidation by banding together with others of his kind 
("fellow marginal public school grads" ) . Ultimately, however, he 
stresses that his feelings of inadequacy did not derive from his race 
alone, but from class as well. 

Liu believes he was able to achieve acceptance because of an 
"honorary whiteness." He wistfully writes of" the familiar idiom

of progress 
the steady sense of climbing, and climbing higher; .of 
forgetting, and forgetting more., He wears Docker's khakis, shopS 
at Crate & Barrel, and has an affinity for 
predilections he considers inescapably " white." Liu 
this assimilation is inevitable, and from a " half-full" 
tive 
is an enrichment, rather than a dilution. 

The point isn't that Asians and other minorities are generally 
accepted in America today. " The meaning of 
'" Liu 
writes, " has undergone a revolution in the twenry-nine years I have 
been alive, a revolution of color, class, and_ culture." He recogn,izes 
that this is an advancement in itsel£ Nevertheless, he argues that to 
call yourself a minority is to " sustain the dichotomy,, and ~n spite 
of this perpetual movement towards an integrated America, " the 
vocabulary of 'assimilation' has remained ftxed all this time: 
in 
whiteness, which is still our metonym for power; and fixed in 
shame, which is what the colored are expected to feel for e~bracing 
the power." Why, Liu asks, does assimilation have to entail 
ing out the marks of a darker, dirtier past?" 

"Asian American" is a relatively new term, having come into 
use only within the past thirty years. While Liu believes for many, 
a community constitutes a "bulwark 
bigotry,, he 
help but dislike the phrase. He finds it "contrived and, in a more 
profound way, unnecessary." 

It's a one-size-fits-all existence, 
brought into being by a group of vocal collegiate California 
"Orientals." Prior to the Asian American, there was the Chinese 
American, the Japanese American, the Korean American, and oth-
ers 
all of which have been "thrown . . . into the same great bub-
bling cauldron" to create the Asian 
. 
never mind the lack 
of cultural ties. -"The creators of Asian America 
that racial 
nationalism is the most meaningful way of claiming 
life," 
Liu writes. He finds this idea both exciting and frightening. While 
the Asian American community has delineated America's potential 
to be a synthesis of cultures, in doing so, it may be guilty of 
"defer[ring] the greater task of confronting 
life." He 
hopes it is " something useful, something to outgrow."
