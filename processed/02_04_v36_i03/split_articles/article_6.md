I SWING OPEN THE HEAVY 
DOOR to 
Bingham's eighth floor library and find 
myself in a pitch dark room. A boy in thick 
glasses emerges, his eyes squinting at the 
sudden break of light. "What are you doing 
here?" he demands, pulling back his black 
hood. The boy looks at me as if I am an 
intruder and explains that he is about to 
hold a secret meeting. If I want to stay, I 
wiU have to hide. I squirm behind a 
mahogany shelf that sags under the weight 
of neglected antique books. Suddenly, the 
lights flicker on and, through a crack in the 
woodwork, I see a somber procession of 
students. They grab chairs and plop into 
leather couches, all the while murmuring 
in hushed voices. They stare expectandy at 
a boy in a snappy suit. He clears his throat 
and surveys the room. 
"Welcome, • he booms, "to the first 
meeting of the Yale Society for the 
Exploration of Campus Secrets, or YSECS." 
He introduces himself co the expectant 
recruits as James•, the club's CEO or Chief 
Exploration Officer, and goes on co present 
the YSECS elite with a sweep of his arm: the 
cheery girl to his right is his Chief 
Investigative Accomplice; at her side sits 
the Chief Information Officer; last comes 
the obligatory Foreign Minister, an enthu-
siastic southerner named Jed. • 
YSECS, which James founded in 
October of 2.003, is a club seemingly like 
any other, dean-approved and registered 
with 
the 
Undergraduate 
Funding 
Committee. In acruality, the society is a 
highly organiud coalition of"elite Campus 
Explorers," who embark on expeditions in 
groups of two to four seeking to uncover 
the secrets of Yale's labyrinthine campus. 
The society convenes bi-weekly at the 
group's home base, a "temple• discovered 
FEBRUARY 2.004 
by the group just weeks after the meeting I 
witnessed. It is here that YSECS houses its 
"tome," a book which contains a chrono-
logical .record of their findings, complete 
with digital photographs and explanations 
of how to reach each "secret" location. 
Access to this vast wealth of knowledge is 
by far the greatest perk to being a society 
member. Of course, membership is restrict-
ed. Every inductee must be approved by 
the board and, most importandy, by the 
CEO--which basically means that James 
gets co decide who is in and who is out. 
Once he bestows his approval, the inductee 
must then "go through a brief rirual., of 
being "blindfolded and led co a secret loca-
tion." 
In addition to their temple, YSECS has 
discovered recessing bookshelves, over-
looked alcoves, hidden chapels, and covert 
passageways. Explorations have yielded 
both a crawl space in the $illiman base-
ment that accesses almost every entry way 
and a secret staircase in the green room of 
Sterling that leads to an alcove. A curious 
librarian abetted the discovery of the stair-
case, while the Silliman Tunnel was discov-
ered through shadier methods. An ex-
member describes the route: "In the base-
ment of Silliman, if you go past the high 
voltage door there's this wall that's way 
older than the rest of Silliman, and then 
there's this door." Members do not seem 
put off by such strange modes of entry. For 
example, to enter the Bingham library that 
first night, the boy in glasses had inge-
niously duct-taped a condom to the door-
frame to keep ic from locking. Although 
James officially denies it, ex-members claim 
that the club was once interested in lock-
picking. Jed, now the former foreign min-
ister, reports that the club once discussed 
buying 
a 
fifty 
dollar "lock-picking 
machine." The board, according to Jed, 
even wenc so far as to post pictures of cam-
pus doors whose locks they encouraged 
their members to pick. Jack*, another ex-
member, says morale has falJen since he 
left. He was the only one who could pick 
locks. Whenever they needed to be some-
where they shouldn't be, they would ask 
him. According to Jack, the members 
ignored their own official policy to follow 
Yale's regulations. "If we needed to get in 
there, we'd get in. Just don't get caught, 
they said.· 

While the prospect of lock-picking 
and duet-taping may deter some freshmen 


from joining, YSECS members should rest 
assured that the society is nothing if not 
prepared. Induction night isn't the only 
prerequisite to membership; inductees 
must also sign a release of liability waiver. 
The club is overwhelmingly bureaucratic, 
and most of the dropouts were disappoint-
ed with the business-savvy formality of a 
club they felt should have focused on the 
thrill of exploring. But James does not 
seem put off by the steep dropout rate; he 
says it has allowed a "solid core" to emerge. 
Jack, eschewing this core, dropped out 
because "it was really boring," while Jed, 
the smiley former Foreign Minister, with-
drew because of "board meetings that were 
an hour and a half every week, where we 
just talked about different places to explore 
without going out and exploring." It turns 
out that James' self-appointed title of Chief 
Exploration Officer is more literal than one 
might think. During that first meeting, 
while his cohorts remained seated, James 
appeared to be acting out some business 
school fantasy. Brian,* a bitter Bingham 
resident, describes James as a fascist 
bureaucrat: "I see [the group] line up single 
file outside Bingham, wearing black. 
Uames] yells at them all the time to get 
straighter, to get in a straighter line. And 
they're all wearing all black and he's carry-
ing a briefcase." 

Ex-members reduce the group to sim-
ply the "secret society for freshmen," a mix-
ture of Harry Potter, Hardy Boys, and Star 
Wars paranoia. (The group's website 
www.yale.edu/ysecs 
bears 
the phrase 
"Explore, Padawan. ") When I asked James 
why he loves exploring, he answered, "I am 
constantly 
amazed 
by 
cool 
factor ... There's a satisfaction to finding 
something cool." 

Though YSECS may be struggling to 
hold on to its members, it has managed to 
captivate more onlookers than it has 
inductees. At the same time that James is 
revealing secrets, he is constructing his 
own. As much as he decries the exclusivity 
at Yale, his project is its greatest embodi-
ment. The rest of us may not want to sit 
through tedious board meetings, but we're


not above hankering after the website pass-
word or the secret tome, if only to assure 
ourselves that we're not missing anything.
