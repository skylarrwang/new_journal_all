New Haveners were ral-
lied out of apathy. "There has 
been a bank robbery," DeStefano said 
dramatically, opening one of several 
press conferences on the front steps of 
the bank. The Mayor even appropriated 
city dollars to fund a telephone drive, 
calling the people to action with a phone 
message designed to make New Haveners' 
blood boil: "For 165 years greater New 
Haven working class families have put their 
hard earned savings into New Haven 
Savings Bank. Now insiders want a deal 
that will make them millions and leave 
everyone else out in the cold." To some 
extent, the crusade has been successful. 
Letters decrying the bank's proposal have 
flooded the newspapers. Nearly all of the 
members of Board of Aldermen publicly 
opposed the conversion, and over 300 peo-
ple, many bearing placards with dollar 
signs printed on them, gathered at public 
hearings in Hamden on cold winter days--
first on December 5 and again on January 
5-to show their disapproval. 

The argument that depositors, as own-
ers, deserve some say in the process, 
through a vote or public forum, may be 
ethically mandated, but it is not necessarily 
required by law. In fact, the Connecticut 
State Banking Commission does not even 
recognize a depositor vote. Under state law, 
for a mutual bank to undergo a conversion, 
the Board of Directors must appoint a 
Board of Corporators co represent the 
depositors and approve the decision, which 
explains why 
NHSB appointed such a Board just a few 
months before the conversion was pro-
posed. The Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (FDIC) requires that the bank 
apply for a waiver of a vote by depositors 
(even though Connecticut won't recognize 
a depositor vote). But to obtain the waiver, 
the FDIC must determine chat the Board of 
Corporators is "sufficiently independent 
from the Board of Directors." On 
November 17, the FDIC approved the waiv-
er. 

But despite federal approval, some New 
Haveners cried larceny. DeStefano argued 
that the FDtc's standards for evaluating the 
Board's composition were simply too low. 
Incidentally, NHSB appointed ten members 
of the Board of Directors to the Board of 
Corporators and another eleven connected 
to New Haven Hospital Qoseph A. 
Zaccagnino, President of New Haven 
Hospital is on the Board of Directors). And 
because there have been so many calls to 
the state banking commission about this 
case (nearly ninety opposing the conver-
sion and only four in favor), the chairman 
decided co hold a public hearing in order to 
give the bank, elected officials, and espe-
cially the depositors a chance to testify on 
the matter. At the 
meeting, 
State 
Representative Toni Walker argued that not 
only are the corporators far from indepen-
dent, they are also not representative of the 
depositors--the other prerequisite stipulat-
ed by law. "Twelve percent of depositors are 
low income, 16 percent are of moderate 
incomo--this is not accurately represent-
ed," she said to Commissioner Burke. But 
when the FDIC granted the bank the waiv-
er, this argument had the wind knocked 
out of its sails---effectively becoming little 
more than a moral qualm. 

BUT THE OPPOSITION has additional 
complaints: This is not just theft-it 
is greed. The Board of Directors and 
President claim that the acquisition and 
conversion are necessary for the bank to 
remain competitive. The opposition has 
dubbed this market-made-me-do-it argu-
ment as nothing more than a cover-up for 
the real motivator: personal enrichment. 
It is undeniable that the Board of 
Directors and Patterson stand to profit as a 
result of this conversion. Originally, 14 per-
cent of the stock proceeds were to be ear-
marked for incentive programs for direc-
tors and managers and an additional four 
percent of the proceeds from the conver-
sion were co be distributed to management 
for overseeing the conversion. The pro-
posed $10 a share stock offer is expected to 
add up to $86o million, providing $120-4 
million for management incentives as well as an additional $34.4 millio~ in bonuses 
for overseeing the ·conversion. "With a 
senior management team where five of the 
six senior officers have been there less than 
two . years, it is impossible to comprehend 
this level of generosity," Paul Johnson of 
Guilford wrote in a December letter to the 
N~w Hav~n R~gist~r. Now, thanks to 
DeStefano and Patterson's deal, bank man-
agers, officers, and employees will reap less 
personal gain and the city will get a piece of 
the profit. Though the bank originally ear-
marked $30 million from the conversion to 
go to its own charitable founda-
tion, 
community dissent 
prompted the bank to rise 
to the agreed-upon $40 
million. 

In 
spite 
of 
Mayor 
DeStefano's wrangling, many 
people in the community are dissatisfi~~ 
with the way New Haven Savings Bank has 
done business in the past and fear that the 
situation will only worsen after the merger. 
Last September, CCNE examined NHSB's 
lending record in its "A Ve.r:y Red Line" 
Report. For a bank that supposedly serves 
the inner-city New Haven community and 
boasts 31 branches in 20 towns and com-
munities in the New Haven area, the 
results were damning. 
According to CCNE, in 2002 NHSB 
granted mortgage loans to 25 whites, five 
African Americans and two Latinos in the 
city of New Haven, despite the fact that . 
AfriC:an Americans and Latinos constitute 
the majority of residents in the city. 
Between . 1998 and 2002, NHSB ~de 15 
times the number ofloans to whites than to 
blacks or Latinos. Between 1998 and 2002, 
NHSB consistently made more conventional 
mortgage loans to upper-income neighbor~ 
hoods than low and moderate income 
neighborhoods.· combined. A recent study 
by the National Association of Community 
Organizations for Reform Now ranked 
Greater New Haven seventh highest in ~e 
nation for the rejection of upper-income 
minorities applying for conventional home 
mortgages . 

Ironically, to block die merger legally 
the opposition must sully the hank's name 
while maintaining that the proposed 
changes would damage the community 
even further. According to FDIC rules, if it 
can be proven that NHSB is not fairly serv-
ing ·its existing community through 
unfair lending practices, for examplee-
then it will not be 
allowed to 
acqutre 
other 
banks. 
This 
means that 
if the bank is lending dis-
proportionately to rich whites, 
the FDIC is well within its rights to 
stop its practices from spreading. On 
the other hand,· it is difficult to argue for 
the independence of a bank that is already 
doing such a poor job. A bigger bank, sup-
porters of the conversion argue, would do 
better. The CCNE report suggests that NHSB 
is well below average for its lending to low 
income and minority communities, indi-
cating that most conglomerate banks are 
better 
shooting a hole through the argu-
ment that a local lender makes it easier for 
the working class to get loans. From a prac-
tical perspective, underserved c~mrnunities 
would stand to profit if the bank could 
acquire more capital or were even bought 
out by a bank with a better lending record. 
For example, Wachovia 
a bank that 
runs the length of the east coast, and that 
bought out First Union Bank in New 
Haven 
has the capital to invest and serve 
the communitY" in a way ~at First Union 
and New Haven Savings Bank never could. 
In 2002, 39 percent of Wachovia's conven-
tionaltnortgage lending ($1.2 billion) went 
to low and moderate income

depositors: NHSB gave 28 percent of its 
$308.8 million mortgage dollars . to low-
and 
moderate-income 
depositors. 
Wachovia has invested $734 million in 
community development in Connecticut 
alone, and $325 million of Wachovia's 
·Connecticut community investment goes 
to "affordable housing initiatives" compared. 
with $27 million proposed by NHSB if the 
conversion goes through. Wachovia, not 
even a full-fledged Wal-Mart of the bank-
ing world, has the means to give more to -
·New Haven and the region than a New 
Savings 
Bank, · · or 
even 
a 
NewAlliance, ever could. 

Some supporters of the conversion have 
touted regionalism as a possible way to save 
cities like New Haven with faltering cap-
ital and a green ring of wealthy surround-
ing suburbs. The proposal to acquire banks 
in Manchester and Tolland could· conceiv-
ably strengthen the region by building a 
coalition of investors from the rich sub-
urbs. While regionalism is usually associat-
. ed with redistribution ·of funds from the 
suburbs to the city, this proposal is an odd· 
example of regionalism flowing in the 
other direction. This acquisition would 
involve taking New Haven city capital (93·3 
percent of its deposits are from the New 
Haven metropolitan area} and investing it 
into the homes and businesses of the sub-
urbs. Ideally, this will pull suburban 
resources into the city's financial assets. 
This reverse in cash flow has also inverted 
the usual supporters and opposition to 
regional plans. At the town meeting in 
December, for example, DeStefano criti-
cized the bank for "turning the wealth 
made by New Haven to a program that is 
regional in nature." This might strike some 
as an odd critique, coming as it does from 
the Chairman of the Blue Ribbon 
Commi5sion on Property Tax Burdens and 
Smart Growth Incentives-the same man 
who has recommended the "sharing, on a 
regional basis, of a portion of the state sales 
tax generated in each municipality'' and 
"the sharing of any other additional rev-
enues on a regional basis." The idea of cap-
ital flowing in the other direction does 
seem counter-intuitive, but if the feeling of 
shared identity with surrounding towns 
existed, perhaps this conversion would be a 
little more palatable to community-orient-
ed groups like the ECCO, CCNE, and the AFL-
CIO Greater New Haven Central Labor 
Council. 

Despite the city's multi-million dollar 
windfall, many fear that this money, while 
certainly welcome, will not solve the real 
problem: the bank's discriminatory lending 
practices and wavering commitment to its 
working class clientele. CCNE President 
Andrea Cole sees the NewAlliance for 
Neighborhoods fund as a "nice gesture," 
but fears that the $6 million dollars alone 
will not alter NHSB's policies. Despite 
CCNE's report, the bank has yet to respond 
to its alleged red-lining, and does not seem 
likely to change its policy anytime soon. 
Indeed, having placated the city officials, 
and won state approval, bank executives 
may believe that the worst is over. But 
beyond the walls, some customers and 
community organizations realize a boycott 
will take far more than 300 angry protesters 
at a public hearing to motivate change, and 
they have bigger plans in mind. 
On February 5, Greater New Haven 
Central Labor Council Leader and Local35 
head Robert Proto decided to "stay the 
course" and boycott NHSB by continuing to 
urge its customers to withdraw their money 
from the bank if it goes public. The boy-
cott, also backed by ccNE and_ Ecco, is 
des~gned to cripple the bank into backing 
out of the conversion or, more realistically, 
shock it into devoting more resources to its 
Greater New Haven depositors. Already 
ECCO is planning to mobilize its denomina-
tional members in a massive letter-writing 
campaign aimed at congregations in the 
Manchester and Tolland areas. ECCO
