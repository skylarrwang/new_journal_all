I 
WAS NOT A DEVOUT STUDENT. During my first movement lesson 
at the age of four at the Women's Club in Brussels, Belgium, I 
walked across the floor and the teacher announced in French, 
"She's got talent." Yet every week, my mother had to collect me 
from underneath the classroom piano, where I stubbornly crawled 
halfway through class. She would rake me to the dining room with 
floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a deep forest, where we 
devoured thick, melted Belgian chocolate poured over French vanil-
la ice cream with salty pecans. Early on, I enumerated my dancer's 
Bill of Rights: the right to choose how much or how little I wanted 
to participate, the right to retreat under the piano in the happy 
womb of the music, and the right to a hot fudge sundae at the end 
of it all. If any of these rules had been breached I might never have 
become a dancer, or learned what it means to dedicate oneself to an 
art form. 

After a 12-year professional dance career, I now teach teenagers 
how to dance in pointe shoes at the New Haven Ballet. I took the 
job to earn income and stay involved in dance while I finish my 
undergraduate degree at Yale. The studio has a high ceiling and tall 
windows and in a far corner, the pianist" dutifully pounds out 
walcr.es. Watching the students in my class hobble around to the 
music, I try to recall how I learned to dance. I have performed as a 
ballet dancer with the New York City Ballet, and as a modern 
dancer with White Oak Dance Project and Twyla Tharp Dance. 
Even so, I feel a slight sense of panic trying to explain the most basic 
steps. I simply can't remember what it feels like not to know how 
to dance. After all these years, ballet has become a character in my 
life. I have loved it, internalized it, imagined it as my life-blood, 
wrestled with it, argued with it, and gotten sick of it. Like a spouse, 
it has both returned my love and tortured me. And when it push-
es me to my limit, I abide by my early rules-! take a break, reju-
venate, and then go back to it. 

The fact that I now teach a pointe class is ironic. I have an 
unusual history with pointe shoes. During one rehearsal period 
with City Ballet, I was learning one of the solo Fairy variations in 
Skeping B~auty and at the same time, I was working with a guest 
choreographer named Angelin Preljocaj. I spent the first half of the 
day in a studio with fifty dancers. The ballet mistress straightened 
out lines and made sure everyone had their arms in the same posi-
tion. I worked almost militantly to perfect my Fairy variation. 
Then I crossed the hall to rehearse with Angelin and his assistant. 
He had chosen only eight dancers. We wore ballet slippers that gave 
me a greater range of movement than the restrictive pointe shoes. 
The choreography was mostly contemporary; it required classical 
technique as a foundation, but the movement was more organic to 
the body than ballet. I decided then to become a modern dancer; 
I felt more at home dancing without stiff satin pointe shoes tied on 
my feet. 

Yet every Tuesday evening since September, I have tried to 
teach 14-year-olds how to pirouette on their pointed roes. I stick 
with a handful of technical corrections, expressed in simple lan-
guage. "Straighten your knees!" I shout. That's the absolute first 
thing to remember. Dancing bent-kneed on pointe is bad ballet. It's 
poor technically and can lead to injury. "Roll through your foot!• 
I yell over the music. Gracefulness arises from control, and in 
pointe shoes you establish control by using every m~cle in the foot 
to cushion the ascent and descent. Thumping down off pointe 
appears awkward. One student processes this information, and exe-
cutes the step well. "Good, very nice," I tell her, and she smiles. 
Another student, taller and longer-legged than the others, is dane-
ing underneath hersel£ "Move! You can move more than that! 
This step travels across the floor." She takes off down the diagonal. 
"Straighten the knees, roll through the foot, move." This is the lan-
guage I use most when teaching pointe work. 

I began to learn this language in my first ballet class, at a store-
front studio outside of Pittsburgh. The school was owned by two 
women, a grandmother of six and a soon-to-be airplane mechanic, 
and was named, somewhat exotically, "Ecole de Ballet." Neither 
Sandra Elsaser, a calm white-haired woman, nor Laura Fry, who 
loved flying planes as much as teaching ballet, had ever danced pro-
fessionally. The school was a hobby for them much as it was a busi-
ness. Every day after school, I would change into my leotard in the 
car on the way there, down a pack of raisins for energy, then jump 
out and run down the broken asphalt alleyway in my slippers to the 
back door of the school, just in time to start class. Ecole de Ballet 
was unusual in that it taught a classical British technique. Classes 
were structured around the Royal Academy of Dance syllabus. In 
the spring of every year, a stern-faced examiner arrived from . 
London to test the ballet steps that we had learned over the winter. 

The atmosphere at Ecole de Ballet was relaxed. I remember 
learning how to partner the Saturday that Mrs. Fry declared 
"Boyfriend Day." Every student had to show up with a boy 
usu-
ally an awkward adolescent reluctantly dragged in from among our 
seventh . grade classmates. 
For two hours, Mrs. Fry forced our 
unwilling men to haul us around the studio to T chaikovsky's 
Serenade for Strings in C 
It was fun,_ and we laughed the entire 
time. I was almost too comfortable at the school, however: I staged 
my first act of rebellion against the rigidity of ballet etiquette dur-
ing my sixth grade spring exam by showing up unprepared wearing 
electric blue Wonder Woman "underoos." The colorful speckling 
of fluorescent yellow stars gleamed through the sheer fabric of my 
dress. I went into the exam anyway, and danced around under the 
examiner's upturned nose for fifteen minutes 
the time it took for 
another student's mother to arrive with extra pink briefs. 

I have been wrestling with ballet since those Royal Academy of 
Dance days. A teacher can convey useful information, but at some 
point the student must make a commitment to figuring out how to 
apply the technique with her own head, arms, legs, toes. The chal-
lenges of ballet are not those that marty people commonly face. 
First, you have to figure out how to fit your body into a technique 
that demands superhuman physical precision. Few people have 
ninety-degree turnout, or aerobatic flexibility, or gorgeously high-
arched feet, even those with bodies that are well suited for ballet. 
The task is to come as close as possible to the perf~ct position with-
in your own physical limitations, without injury. Second, you have 
to figure out how to incorporate fluid movement between the basic 
positions. It's easy to "connect the dots" and forget that ballet needs 
to be danced, not placed. Everyone, save the exceptional few, must 
cheat to accomplish these tasks 
the best ballet dancers take short-
cuts, such as sacrificing perfect form for bolder movement. "When 
wondering whether a ballet dancer is good, you ~}ave to ask: How 
ingenious are these shortcuts? How interesting is that• particular 
way of solving the problem? 

During the Sleeping Beauty rehearsal period, I realized that 
pointe shoes and classical ballet were far too restricting to my nat-
ural way of moving and to my personality. They did not offer what 
I wanted out of dance. I started to feel like I didn't fit in at City 
Ballet anymore. I joined the company certain that I was every 
ounce the ballerina, and came out six years later thinking, "I know 
that I'm a dancer, but maybe the tutu and the tiara don't interest me
