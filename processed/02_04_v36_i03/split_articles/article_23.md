IN UPSTATE NEW YORK, 25-year-old Jenny Shimada has been reli-
giously following news reports of a kidnapping in Berkeley, 
California. There, a wealthy girl has been taken captive by a 
cadre of revolutionaries who are protecting, among other things,
the 19-year-old's status as a member of the wealthiest family in San 
Francisco. The cadre reminds Jenny of old times, back when they 
used to share far-left-swinging egalitarian views with her Berkeley 
friends the way most people share toothpaste or cigarettes. She has 
since fled California after helping to bomb a government building 
and started a new life. When she's asked by an old friend to harbor 
the revolutionary kidnappers, Jenny initially hesitates. For the 
moment, she'd rather remain the aliased Iris Chan alone and 
unfound than deal with the ghosts of her radical past. In spite of 
herself, she eventually takes members of the cadre to an old aban-
doned farmhouse to regroup. Jenny's struggle to reconcile her past 
with her present is at the core of Susan Choi's novel American 
Woman. Based loosely on the Symbionese Liberation Army's kid-
napping of Patty Hearst, this powerful second novel is more than a 
mere reworking of an historical event; it is a moving political state-
ment that exposes the ever-present tension of class and race. 

Choi, who graduated from Yale in 1990, is one of many Asian 
American Yale graduates to address concerns about their communi-
ty's identity in contemporary America. Eric Liu, another class of 
1990 graduate, chronicled his own experiences as a Chinese 
American in his book The Accidental Asian: Notes of a Native 
Speaker. In it, Liu writes candidly about his childhood, adolescence, 
and young adulthood, ruminating on topics ranging from 
Chinatown to Tiger Woods to the Jewish community. Examining 
the ways in which Jews have assimilated into and even defined 
American culture, he wonders whether the Asian American com-
munity can do the same, helping to define American culture in 
ways that aren't strictly beef and broccoli. 

In terms of content and style, Liu's Accidental Asian could not 
be more different from Choi's novel. American Woman subtly brings 
the still pressing issues of societal and racial rigidity to the forefront. 
Accidental Asian speculates on what costs are incurred by the cultural
evolution to "whiteness" that has come to be virtually synony-
mous with assimilation. What links the two works, however, and 
perhaps the Asian American experience as a whole, is the idea that 
being Asian American may be no less than being simply American. 
When issues of race are not being explicitly addressed in the novels, 
you tend to forget that Jenny is Japanese-American, because she is 
like her second-generation counterparts more "American" 
than anything else. Liu echoes this sentiment as he wistfully asks 
where his "Chineseness" lies. "In my looks, surely," he writes. "In 
my culture, vestigially. In my behavior, too?" His answer seems to 
be "no," and he writes that "Chineseness seems an irrelevance: an 
inert container, just one among many, for holding the memories of 
shared experience .... It is the liquid of memory, not the cup we 
drink it from, that gives our lives content and reveals our humanity." 

Both Liu's Accidental Asian and Choi's American Woman sue-
ceed, ultimately, in relaying their distinct but overlapping messages 
because each refuses to be bound by the relatively new genre, if 
you can call it that, of Asian American-authored literary works. In 
breaking out of this mold, both works ultimately surpass those of 
their predecessors. Each has created a book that is effective rather 
than contrived. 

Choi's novels, for instance, are more in the vein of Joan Didion 
than of Amy Tan, or even those of the generally likeable, often com-
mendable Harvard graduate Gish Jen. Choi's novel is more about 
politics than it is about anti-racism or Americanized daughters and 
their East-minded parents. Jenny Shimada is simply the book's pro-
tagonist not its heroine or a savior to the world of Asian American 
households. She is one of the novel's three minority characters, but 
her Japanese background is not by any means the novel's central 
focus. As the title suggests, Jenny Shimada is the novel's American 
not Asian American woman. Much like Liu's under-
standing of his Chineseness as "an inert container" and the "cup we 
drink ... from," Jenny's Japaneseness does not dictate the whole of 
her actions. It is, indeed, who she is "vestigially," as Liu puts it, and 
this is precisely what renders the novel effective and simultaneously 
believable. As the title suggests, Jenny Shimada is the novel's American 
not "Asian American" woman. 

Choi does not, however, completely downplay the issue of race. 
In several instances, she directly addresses it effectively. Jenny's 
father long ago estranged from his daughter still remains in the 
background, struggling to come to terms with his unjust intern-
ment at Manzanar. A father-daughter reconciliation brings the 
novel to its fulfilling and necessary close. 

Tensions also run high between Jenny and the revolutionaries. 
At one point, a member of the cadre tells Jenny, "Your skin is a privilege. 
Your Third World perspective's a privilege," to which Jenny 
replies, "All I'm saying is, stop saying I'm from the Third World 
when I'm from California." 

Choi refuses to be falsely optimistic. After emerging from 
prison, for example, Jenny muses that "the world hadn't healed itself 
in the meantime." She comes to the sad realization that "it was just 
the same fatal world as always, with its staggering inequities, which 
she realized now weren't exceptions to be excised but the rules of the 
game, the very engine that kept the thing running." This realism is 
one of the reasons the novel succeeds.
