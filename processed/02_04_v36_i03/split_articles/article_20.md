**Title: Jail Diversion: A New Approach to Mental Illness in the Criminal Justice System**
**Author: Romy Drucker**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Instead of committing individuals to mental health facilities, 
state correctional officials are incarcerating potential patients. In 
2001, the Connecticut Department of Correction reported that the 
number of inmates with mental health problems rose from 5.2 per-
cent to 12.3 percent. 

New Haven is no exception. According to sources at the 
Connecticut Mental Health Center, the New Haven Police 
Department handles the arrests of people who suffer from mental 
illness are handled no differently from arrests of unaffilicted indi-
viduals. A man who pulls up a chair at a Chapel Street lunch 
counter may be arrested if he becomes agitated and confused after 
he discovers that he cannot pay. A disoriented wanderer who floats 
into the Yale School of Management to use the lavatory for a show-
er may be convicted of trespassing. Many petty crimes like these are 
committed by people who are confused if not completely oblivious 
to their actions--even while they stand for their mug shot and press 
a finger ·onto an ink-pad. These innocents unknowingly project the 
· image of a prototypical "deranged" criminal. There is a wide range 
of conditions-schiwphrenia, manic depression, and even mental 
retardation-manifested in any number of non-violent misde-
meanors. But one doctor in New Haven has started a program ro 
reverse the trend, employing not just her expertise, but also a few of 
the people who understand the problem best. 

TH.E DIMLY LIT, STERILE MONOLITH of the Connecticut 
Mental Health Center on Park Street, Dr. Baranoski, who is 
so an Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at Yale, 
takes phone calls &om her small office lined with binders, folders 
and a few holiday memories. As the director of jail diversion in New 
Haven, Dr. Baranoski i$ at the forefront of a movement to keep the 
mentally ill out of jails. The files that line the walls of her office are 
the sealed cases of mentally ill offenders removed from the criminal 
justice system. These files are testaments to the progra.nM success. 
"The number of [mentally ill] people in jail in Connecticut is down 
for the first time in years," she says. The prototype has been 
replaced with a new model for criminal justice, facilitating the suc-
cessful diversion of the mentally ill. The program combines the 
expertise of medical and legal professionals with the personal expe-
riences of peer mentors who have gone through the process them-
selves. 

New Haven was one of three initial test sites for jail diversion, 
which was extended four years ago to include all Connecticut 
courts. The test sites helped enable the program's current success. 
Jail diversion programs provide on-site services to mentally ill 
defendants by placing mental health clinicians in the courts. These 
clinicians act as liaisons. With the permission of the attorney, clin-
icians notify defendants of alternatives to jail. According to a report 
issued to the Connecticut legislature, regular meetings, attended by 
the defense, prosecution, judicial staff, and mental health and cor-
rectional facility administrators allow for a resolution that "reduces 
jail [time], number of court appearances and related court costs, 
hospital days, and costs associated with arrests." Diversion has 
nothing to do with the way charges are resolved and does not affect 
the outcome of a case. 

These programs also have the potential to ameliorate the prob-
lem of dangerously overcrowded jails. Currently, Connecticut sends 
its overflow prisoners to Virginia, providing a controversial and 
expensive solution to the prison jam. A 2001 study by the 
Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis at University of 
Connecticut found that legislation to divert first and second time 
nonviolent drug offenders to treatment would save taxpayers 
$5,000 per nonviolent offender in crime savings, $7,300 in reduced 
arrest and prosecution costs, and $4,800 in health care costs. 
"Incarceration for people who are not criminals will not deter 
them from further problems," argues Dr. Baranoski. Consequently, 
the gravest proble.Ql associated with the incarceration of mentally ill 
people is a sky-high recidivism rate. Whether rehabilitation occurs, 
in America' s jails is debatable, but it is clear that mentally ill peo-
ple are not reaping any benefits. Diversion programs create an 
atmosphere in which criminals can be directly connected to the 
health care system. 

According to Dr. Baranoski, jail diversion in New Haven is 
effective because it is staffed by former offenders who understand 
what it means to be relegated to the margins of society. A woman 
with a severe mental illness created the curriculum. Nancy, an 
author and former teacher at Quinnipiac University's Public Health 
Department, built the curriculum of the Citizenship Program and 
oversees the peer mentor training sessions which are based on 
"patience, persistence, and creativity." The program strives to give 
its clients a foothold in the community by networking them with 
social services and connecting them to peer mentors, who have been 
through the justice system. Having dealt with some of the manifes-
tations of mental illnesses, including drug and alcohol abuse, pover-
ty, and criminal behavior, peer mentors can counsel with anecdotal 
therapy. Dr. Baranoski turns to her file cabinet, unlocks it, and lays 
open her folders. 

She pauses over the cases of Devan and Robert, two ex-crimi-
nals with mental illnesses who have served extended jail time, dealt 


with drug abuse and homelessness, and are 
now peer mentors. Though in their pasts, 
they have had drug problems and many 
nights when they had no place to sleep, on 
a recent afternoon the two men sat chatting 
in Baranoski' s office. Devan, a small but 
commanding man who looks like he might 
be an extra in a 198o's rap video, wore a col-
orful Coogi sweater. Robert, a big man 
with broad shoulders, sat across the table in 
an elevated wheelchair. 

Devan currently earns $Io an hour 
working at the Connecticut Mental Health 
Center in the Citizenship Program that the 
center offers as part of its jail diversion 
treatment. Though Devan is paid, he 
spends most hours as a volunteer, working 
overtime with· the people who need him. 
The program allows mentally ill people to 
give back to their community, creating a 
cycle by which mentally ill people help 
their peers live with hope, instead of being 
consumed by feelings of isolation and 
alienation. "I never had access to give," he 
says. "And I love the karma of it all. All this 
was accidental." 

As a public advocate, Devan is eager to 
share his story with his mentees. "My strat-
egy is to be honest. I do with you, not for 
you, and if you' re willing to work, I'll help 
you," he says wisely. Though he seems a bit 
aloof, sketching a face in detail in a clut-
tered conference room, Devan is sharp and 
one of the Center's most successful peer -
mentors. "I know the con-artists from the 
bullshitters," he says pointedly, as he con-
tinues with his portrait. 

When one of the members of the 
group disappeared, and no one at the cen-
ter could find him, Devan knew where to 
look. He imagined what was going on in 
the lost man' s mind. He remembered the 
feelings of vulnerability he used to suffer, 
and he searched in the most remote and 
dangerous part of the city. There, Dev~ 
found the lost man. Devan does not. only 
look out for others, he has someone who 
looks after him and builds up his confi-
dence, his ·own peer mentor, Robert: 
"When I look at Rob, I say I can' t quit." 
"Peer mentors give people confidence 
to see that they are not hopeless or worth-
less," Robert explains. There is a distance 
between these positive words· and the 
stone-faced man who absorbs himself in 
the paperwork that floods his desk. But 
Rob is emotionally involved in his work, 
recounting the story of a man suffering 
from borderline disorder who stepped into 
a store and was accused of shoplifting. 
"The people in the store didn' t like him 
there," says Robert,. "They called the 
police, said he was shoplifting, but he had 
all his receipts and the stuff was from 
another store .... " The man knew objecting 
would most likely land him back in jail, at 
least temporarily, so he remained quiet. He 
later told Robert, "the reason I di4n' t fight 
was because I knew you"d go to court with 
me, Robert." Robert' s story intimates the 
tension between mentally ill people and the 
law when an intermediary is not present. 

Robert shuffles through the pile of 
homemade · but official looking business 
cards of other peer mentors. Papers con-
cerning housing options and ways to 
obtain food stamps litter his desk. These 
guys know the type of resources needed to 
connect the mentally ill to the city. "To 
connect people with housing I have to 
know different criteria for housing. When I 
go to class, I ask people, 'Who needs food 
vouchers?' I don't take phone-calls after 
8:00 PM but I give people my number if 
they need me," he· says. Like Devan, he 
takes pride in being an advocate, a 
resource, who can implement change. 

Through the peer-mentoring system, the 
Citizenship Program provides stability for 
the unstable, and Robert and Devan can 
find consistency and routine in their new 
ability to give. 

Although jail diversion programs are 
new, the logic behind them is not. Jail 
diversion takes issue with the failed crimi-
nal justice system and asks lawmakers to 
assess failures in the context of specific 
problems. It is not the ideal panacea, but 
instead deals with a widespread problem 
through practical meat:ts. Dr. Baranoski has 
even started advocating police tutorials and· 
other pre-emptive approaches dealing with 
mentally-ill criminals. "The New Haven 
Police have been very resourceful and sensi-
tive to mental health issues," Dr. Baranoski 
says. She lauds their sincerity and efforts to 
learn more about how to observe mental 
illness and deal with it accordingly. 

At the heart of this attempt to reform 
the criminal justice system are the people 
who won' t give up looking for 
and find-
ing 
those who have lost their way. 

Tonight, Devan and' Robert may be work-
ing overtime. And the light in Dr . 
Baranoski's office is still on.
