You MAY HAVE SEEN IT at Durfee's: the bot-
tle with the block-lettered "T" wirhin 
which hides a symbol, design, or character. 
The more saccharine varieties showcase 
labels that read "A Tad Sweer." Turn the 
bottle, and on the back of the label, you 
will find a caffeine comparison to coffee. 
Where you might exp~ct 
to find an ingredients list, 
there is instead a para-
graph describing the tea's 
complex brewing process 
and the source of its rare 
leaves. You might read 
about chamomile tea leaves, &om a 
Guatemalan farming co-operative 
or Haarlem Honeybrush leaves 
&om a subsistence farming com-
munity in South A&ica. Above the 
nutritional facts is a postscript, 
which varies according to the kind 
of tea. For example, if you happen 
across "First Nation Peppermint," 
a bottle with a picture of Medicine 
Crow within the "T," the postscript 
will describe him as an Indian chief 
&om the late 19th century and go on to 
praise peppermint's healing properties. 
And, in keeping with their honest image, 
the company donates a portion of the sales 
to the Crow Community. 

Honest Tea is more than a slightly 
sweetened drink. Not only is it the first Fair 
Trade bottled tea, it represents an "innova-
tive approach to ensuring integrity in the 
global market." Its creators, Seth Goldman 
(soM '95) and Barry Nalebuff, Professor at 
Yale School of Management, built Honest 
Tea with a strong awareness of both the 
treatment of its employees and the com-
munities it affects. They seek honesty in all 
aspects of their business. All the tea is 
organic, and the company strives to assist 
economically troubled communities, often 
at the expense of the almighty dollar. 

But Honest Tea was not started to save 
the world: Rather, Nalebuff founded the 
organization in part to satiate his own 
picky palate. According to Nalebuff, a 
major flaw in the beverage industry is that 
while it offers a wide variety of flavors, it 
provides almost no variation in sweetness. 
A little sugar can vastly improve the taste of 
a drink, but too much sugar or artificial 
sweetener can ruin it. "It's like salt," 
Nalebuff says. ''A little salt is great. A little 
more is okay. [Add] too much, and the 
food becomes inedible." 
account. 
Nalebuff 
first 
mentioned this dissatis-
faction with the bever-
age industry nine years 
ago, during a SOM class 
discussion on a Coke 
versus Pepsi case study. 
He soon realized he was not 
alone in his frustration. One stu-
dent, Seth Goldman, whole-
heartedly agreed. Three years 
later, the rwo founded Honest 
Tea, which has grown into a 
nationwide business phenome-
non that sold approximately 10 
million bottles of tea in 2003 for 
a net profit of $5.5 million. Nor 
too bad for a company that tries 
to put the world before its bank 

In fact, during that first discussion, 
neither knew any more about tea than the 
Average Joe, and for the time: being their 
frustration stayed in the classroom. After
