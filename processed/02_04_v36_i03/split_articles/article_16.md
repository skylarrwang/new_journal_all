AST DECEMBER. A NEW HAVEN woMAN was dri-
ving home to Fair Haven from her job cleaning 
house on Mansfield Street. As she turned 
onto Prospect Street, Marta* noticed a Yale Police car 
in her rearview mirror. She continued driving for three 
of four blocks, more carefully now, all the while growing 
more nervous, since for several other illegal immigrants 
she knows, encounters with the police have meant harass-
ment, large fines, and even deportation. 

At a stop sign several blocks down Prospect Street, the 
Yale patrol car finally pulled her over. The reason, she later 
learned, was that her license plate was inside her back window 
instead of attached to her bumper. In Marta's neighborhood, near 
the intersection of Grand Avenue and Ferry Street, it is routine for 
residents to keep their license plates inside the car to prevent them 
from being stolen. No New Haven police officer had ever stopped 
her for it before. 

The Yale officer asked to see Marta's license and registration. 
Marta, who immigrated to Connecticut illegally from her native 
Mexico three years ago, told him she did not have a license. Instead, 
Marta gave the officer her Mexican consular identification card-
her only form of 10. With the officer now holding her name, 
address, and photograph, Marta's fears intensified: She worried that 
he would follow her home or, worse, arrest her on the spot. 

Instead, the officer asked her where she worked and then, 
noticing her hesitant response, asked if she spoke English. "I said 
'No I don't, but I'm going to school.' And he said to me, 'You have 
to learn English,"' she later recounted. 

The officer's comment heightened Marta's usual fear <;>f police. 
"They always make me afraid," she explained. "They are able to 
deport us and so they make me afraid, because it was very difficult 
for me ro get here, and I have my son here." So she did not say any-
thing when the officer returned to his car, carrying Marta's consular 
ID card with hi!_ll. She was relieved just to roll up her window and 
head towards home. The patrol car followed her for several more 
blocks, fading from view only when she reached Elm Street and 
turned left towards Fair Haven-and away from Yale. 

T
HE MISSION OF THE YALE PoUCE DEPARTMENT, posted on their 
website, is simple and straightforward: "Building on a century 
of service and achievement, we are dedicated to reducing and 
prevepting crime, and serving our community in partnership with 
the city of New Haven." As sworn police officers, imbued with the 
same authority as members of any other Connecticut police force, 
the Yale police respond to calls, give tickets, and make arrests any-
where in the city of New Haven. In practice, though, the depart-
ment focuses on the Yale campus and Yale-owned buildings, which 
span the area from the Yale Bowl to the newly acquired physical 
plant on James Street-with Yale-New Haven Hospital, Science 
Hill, central campus, and a hefty swath of commercial and residen-
tial New Haven in berween. Recently, the YPD has expanded in 
other directions as well. According to the New Haven Police
