"T;e first thing I'm going to say is that Ellen and Rob are not 
our real names," says Ellen Kay, of herself and her husband. 
"No one knows about this ... the only people who know are 
other swingers. Most of our friends don't even know." 

Ellen and Rob's "Total Eclipse" website, a guide to being sexu-
ally adventurous in Connecticut, defines swingers as "people who, 
usually as a couple, enjoy the sexual company of others couples in 
the bedroom." But a definition cannot nearly capture the essence of 
the swinger lifestyle. Swingers' sex lives proudly extend into realms 
and positions most people risk only in their minds. They act out the 
fantasies, or nightmares, of the rest of us: These people do have 
threesomes and do enjoy it. And if Ellen and Rob's dream does 
come true, there may be a club for swingers right here in New 
Haven. 

The point of swinging, according to Ellen, is "sexual enhance-
ment, like a sex toy or a porno that is real." Those who 
participate are generally in their thirties, secure in 
their marriages, but looking for a way to branch 
out. Total Eclipse warns potential swingers that 
sexual partners most likely will not become 
close friends. As Rob bluntly purs it, "It's 
unpretentious. Most swingers just want to 
fuck. They don't want best friends or golfing 
buddies." Swingers have outSide lives, includ-
ing kids, regular jobs, and non-swinging friends. 

The swap from daily life to swinging involves 
more than just stripping and jumping into bed. Ellen likes 
to meet and talk to other couples before the clothes hit 
the floor-it makes her feel more comfortable. Ellen 
and Rob also have one couple with whom they regu-
larly partner swap. Through Total Eclipse, they now 
arrange parties, first screening the participantS, through 
onllne profiles, pictures, and information that party-goers send in 
advance. Their next parry, scheduled for the end of February, is 
already booked. Who got rejected? "Well ... when you're married 
and all you want is a fantastic sexual experience with [a person], you 
don't want them to be 300 pounds," Ellen admitS. "I am very, very 
fussy-I don't want anyone who's crazy, old, ugly .... " Essentially, 
Ellen would like to swing with people like her. 

She and Rob fumbled through unremarkable upbringings in 
the same Connecticut town. They were vaguely aware of each other 
as members of mutually prominent families, meeting occasionally 
at church functions and local political eventS. When Ellen came 
home from college, they crept into each other's lives. Despite an 
eleven year age difference, their friendship soon led to dating which 
became serious dating. Five months ago they married. And now 
they are starting to fool around with plans to start their own busi-
ness and to have children. They began, in many ways, as a typical 
couple, preparing for a quiet life. Since they started swinging, how-
ever, this humdrum existence has fallen by the wayside. 

Now, the excitement of their lifestyle is underlined by the risk 
of exposure. The couple fears that if people in Rob's hometown 
found out about his swinging, his family's business could suffer. The 
possibility "certainly worries us-there's always the risk, but, if we 
meet anyone we know at a club, they don't have anything on us that 
we don't have on them," says Ellen. If anyone from their public life 
ever found out, they would just "deal with it and move on." 

"We're not ashamed of what we do," Ellen said, "but others 
don't understand, and we can't make them more open-minded." 

Most swingers confine their activities to the privacy of the bed-
room, but some, like Ellen and Rob, have found 
a way to mix business with pleasure. Their entre-
preneurial goals have transformed them from 
people who experiment privately to people who 
run ads sandwiched between strip dubs and sex 
videos in the giggle-worthy back pages of the 
New Haven Advocau and who now have even larger aspira-
tions: a "nice, dean dub" for swingers. 

While Ellen and Rob are excited about the success of 
their first parties, they are even more thrilled at the prospect 
路 of opening their dub in New Haven or another nearby city. 
They envision a multi-floor.,...enue--one level with a dance 
floor, a OJ, and quieter rooms with tables and chairs for hang-
ing out and talking, while upstairs, patrons will find "rooms in 
which to swing." Some clubs for swingers already exist, but Total 
Eclipse is taking a new approach: "Mostly swinging is for couples, 
but we're trying to get路 singles involved," Ellen explained. 

Organizers of swinging discriminate heavily against single men, 
while courting single, especially bi-sexual women. The supply of the 
first radically outstrips the latter, but Ellen and Rob would like to 
find ways to integrate both. "We want to give single men a place to 
go," said Ellen. Part of their drive to bring those on the outskirts to 
the swinger community comes from "one of our little fantasies" -a 
路 threesome of Rob, Ellen, and another man. With their own dub, 
they could invite the people they want to get to know. 

If their dub does open in New Haven, would they consider 
hosting a party for college students? "It's definitely a& option ... 
although Rob and I might sit that one out ... " 

Perhaps someday soon Total Eclipse will mount some compe-
tition for Toad's, giving new meaning to the term "booty cam." 
Until then, the rest of us can only finger the edges of what goes on 
in Ellen and Rob' s bedroom.
