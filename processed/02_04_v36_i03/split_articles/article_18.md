an "Outsiders Not Welcome" sign above 
the gate. Activist Stephen Osserman oc' 02, 
Mus'o3 claims that several New Haven high 
school students have told him that they 
avoid the downtown and Broadway areas 
for fear of harassment from the Yale police. 
In Osserman's opinion, the only way to 
improve the situation is to revoke the ypo's 
policing authority altogether: "I think that 
the Yale Police have no business arresting 
people in the community ... Unless the safe-
ty of a stud~nt is directly involved there's 
no reason that [they] should be there unless 
the New Haven police call for back-up." 
Osserman's solution would likely 
strike Lt. Patten as a whole-sale breach of 
duty. In his view, ignoring crime is really 
not an· option. "We are sworn police offi-
cers, so when we see violations we have an 
obligation to act," he said. 

The New Haven police seem to share 
this view. For them, the presence of the 
Yale Police in the campus vicinity allows 
more time for the NHPD to focus on serious 
crimes in the rest of the city. When it 
comes to police officers on duty in New 
Haven, says Captain Winchester, "The 
more the merrier." But while the NHPD is 
grateful for the company, when Yale stu-
dents are stumbling drunkenly around the 
campus, possibly committing some of the 
same crimes that earn New Haven residents -
an anonymous mention in the Yale Bulletin 
police log, it's a different matter. As 
Captain Winchester chuckles, "We'll let 
them handle that." It's a deferral of author-
ity that, for better or worse, Marta could 
not expect.
