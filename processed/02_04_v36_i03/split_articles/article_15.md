spokesman Pat Spears sees the conversion 
as a failure of the city's civic elite to put 
New Haven's needs before their own pock-
ets. He hopes the boycott will prompt the 
bank to "atone for its lending record," both 
by publicly addressing the accusations of 
red-lining and by instituting practices such 
as bilingual hiring and post-mortgage 
counseling for first-time homeowners. 
CCNE's Cole agrees that if the boycott can-
not halt the merger, it will hopefully force 
NewAlliance into offering the community 
"a real plan and accountability." 

If successful, the boycott may not ulti-
mately keep NHSB from going public, but it 
might be enough to keep the bank local. As 
New Haven's last mutual savings bank and 
one of a dwindling number of small-town 
businesses in today's incorporated America, 
New Haven Savings Bank has a certain 
symbolic currency, but also a real social 
obligation to its depositors. Two funds 
approaching $30 million each for the city 
and its residents is no mean sum, but New 
Haven is a city that knows that throwing 
money at a problem seldom solves it. Be it 
New Haven Savings Bank or New Alliance, 
if the bank does not stand up for its com-
munity, the community will continue to -
stand up to it.
