EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
In the post-September 11 era, the kinds of stories we tend to 
herald as good news so often s~em cursory treatments of the 
same, tired topics: victory abroad, stability at home, the growth of 
the economy, the absence of upartisan bickering" from the halls of 
Congress. They are not so much news as a rehashing of what has 
already come to pass. 

This issue of The New journal attemptsÂ· to take an unconven-
tional approach to journalism. Our writers have sought out stories 
still very much unresolved and uncertain: The potential boycott of 
a city's last community-owned bank, racial profiling in the Yale 
Police Department, the plight of the mentally ill in the American 
justice system. The aim of these articles has been not simply to 
uncover aspects of society typically ignored, but to cast fresh, criti-
cal light on so-called "old news." They raise questions not so 
much with the goal of providing answers, but of catalyzing debate 
and challenging entrenched assumptions. 

None of this is to say that news cannot be optimistic. As these 
pages have tried to show, we believe the lenses of struggle and 
conflict reveal the potential for a future far more inspiring than an 
easy contentment with the status quo.
