"The major contractors have these services by

valuable contractors. And it's hard to 
tell which way they're leaning." 

Of course, Pentagon officials are not 
the only ones reluctar;lt to crack down 
on a defense contractor. Many con-
gressmen and senators are similarly in-
clined. They may have a defense com-
pany in their district- and defense 
companies 
are 
traditionally large 
employers-or they may rely on cam-
paign contributions from contractors 
around election time. 

"The contractors will do a lot to in-
fluence politicians," admits one Con-
gressional aide. "They'll give contribu-
tions, do favors, take people up in their 
airplanes- stroking them. They really 
get their hooks in these guys, especially 
the congressmen, who have to get 
elected every two years. The represen-
tatives all want to cut defense until it 
comes to their district and then they 
say, 'Oh shit, we can't do that.' But the 
contractors, they lean in路 on these 
senators and representatives, and they 
give in every time." 

In this case, the congressman getting 
leaned on is Sam Gejdenson; Electric 
40 The New Tournai/December 6. 1985 
Boat is his district. As EB points out in 
its annual report, the GD division is a 路 
"Major Factor in Local Economy." In 
1984 Electric Boat paid $620 million in 
wages and salaries; $4 million in prop-
erty taxes; $7 million in unemployment 
tax, and spent $70 million at 653 
Connecticut businesses. 

Electric Boat's imposing presence in 
his district 
makes life 
tricky for 
Gejdenson, a Democrat who generally 
opposes Pentagon demands. Gejden-
son depends on EB for votes and 
money just as EB and its workers 
depend on Gejdenson for representa-
tion. So when GD's expense chicanery 
came to light, Gejdenson had to walk a 
fine line. His solution was, in a way, 
quite clever: 
don't defend the 
company, defend the workers. 

"We had to make sure that there was 
a separation between EB and its 
corporate 
management and 
its 
decisions," Gejdenson says. "We didn't 
want the workers punished for some-
thing they hadn't done." 

Gejdenson is at least forthright about 
his priorities. "Your first obligation is 
to your district," he argues. "If 
anything that makes you concerned 
about the status of that company, it's 
that they have a significant number of 
employees in your district." 

Though Gejdenson's concern for 
workers is well-meant, it avoids the 
national issue of defense fraud 
altogether. The problem arises when 
congressmen, representing GD 
divisions all over the country, start 
saying the same thing. Democrat or 
Republican, it makes no difference 
when the economic prosperity of your 
own district is threatened. 

"Before we started our hearings," 
Pete 
Stockton rememh'ers, 
"Tip 
O'Neill and Jim Wright from Fort 
Worth (where GD makes F-16s] put 
their 路arms around Dingle and said, 
'Gee, John, don't you have something 
else better to do with your time? These 
guys at GD are nice guys.' But once the 
hearings started nobody has tried to 
defend GD because what they've do"ne 
is just so blatant." 

Political influence and friendly rela-
tionships with the Pentagon are not the 
only cards General Dynamics can play 
in times of trouble. As long as GD has 
a monopoly on the Trident, the Pen-
tagon's options in punishing the com-
pany are limited, and GD knows it. In 
1976, during a cost dispute with the 
Navy, GD threatened to halt Trident 
construction entirely unless the dispute 
was promptly settled-which it was. 

"The major contractors have these ser-
vices by the balls," Stockton says. "The 
services supposedly have nowhere else 
to go for their weapons." "It would 
send shock waves through Congress if 
General Dynamics stopped making 
Tridents," Senator Chris Dodd said in 
February. Thus, debarment-pro-
hibiting a 
company 
from 
doing 
business with the government- is out. 


So is taking the Trident contract away 
from GD and giving it to someone else. 
At the moment, there is no one else to 
give the contract to. 

Of this country's other shipyards, 
only Newport News Shipbuilding, a 
Virginia corporation which builds the 
Navy's nuclear aircraft carriers, is close 
to being able to build a Trident. But 
awarding Newport News a Trident 
contract (assuming the company would 
bid on one, though it never has before) 
would probably increase the price of 
the Trident. "GD has already built all 
but the last seven or so of the Tridents 
the Pentagon has planned for," 
Gejdenson says. "To start splitting up 
the last seven, the cost of tuning up 
[Newport News] would be enormous. 
The question is, 'Do you want to pay 
the price?'" 

Colonel O'Brien at Department of 
D efense (DOD) adds "People are con-
stantly crying for competition. Still, as 
the saying goes, 'Only God can路 make a 
tree, but only Newport News Drydock 
can make a nuclear aircraft carrier.' To 
the people who are out yammering for 
competition, I say fine, get three or 
four friends together with eight or 10 
billion dollars and build a shipyard.'' 

Lieutenant Allen at the Pentagon 
confirms that the Navy has asked 
Newport News to consider bidding 
for the next Trident contract, but 
there is a good chance that request will 
come to nothing. Preparing a bid on a 
military contract involves a huge 
amount of time and money; Newport 
News might not want to commit itself 
to a bid only to see Electric Boat win 
Trident construction: carrying 24 nuclear warheads, the submarine can stay 
submerged for over three months.
