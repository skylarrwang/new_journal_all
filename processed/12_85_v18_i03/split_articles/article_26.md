One of the tasks of the new president of Yale will be to 
continue the work of Mr. Giamatti in establishing 
humanist rather than theistic languages, myths and rites 
to describe and rehearse the purposes of the institution. 
One of the tasks of the new University chaplain will be to 
affirm the new president's efforts to do·so, while at the 
same time rigorously describing the inadequacies of 
whatever the new president proposes. If both will accept 
their respective tasks in this area, it could mean an in-
teresting future. 

It's part of the problem that the history must be given. 
Most people know that Yale, some centuries ago, was 
started by ministers. Too few realize how profoundly and 
pervasively Christian concepts and practices have shaped 
the institution and its people. Yale's purpose was to 
prepare men for the service of the Church and civil state. 
That one should serve the civil state was a sub-set of ser-
vice to the Church, as in love of God and neighbor. The 
languages taught included Hebrew and Greek, in part to 
facilitate the reading and understanding of the Holy 
Scriptures. It was God's world which was to be studied, 
and when Yale decided to take science seriously, it sent a 
Christian professor to England to learn science so the con-
flict between science and religion would not find root at 
Yale. The president of Yale was the stated preacher for 
Chapel services and all students and faculty members 
were required to attend. The rhythm of each day was 
morning and evening prayer. 

The ethos of Yale was Calvinist Christianity. There 
was a price to be paid for its tightly woven fabric. Jews 
and Roman Catholics were few. in number, both within 
the student body and among the faculty, and those who 
did come to Yale, were allowed to come, were expected to 
live and work within the assumptions and practices which 
each Yale generation inherited and embraced. 

Some mark the change-time by the coming of Arthur 
Hadley, the first lay president. More likely the change ac-
tually occurred in the period following the Second World 
War when the college increased in size and large numbers 
of veterans could afford to come, men made self-confident 
and mobile by warfare. 

Vestiges of the past are still with us. Prayers and hymns 
at Freshman Convocation are a shock to the many who 
have no idea that this is Yale's source and tradition. 
Crosses adorn our buildings and banners, a chapel is the 
largest structure in our central quadrangle, the gradua-
tion procession detours around Center Church and the 
festivities begin with a prayer by the chaplain and end 
with a bishop's benediction. Substantively, however, the 
language of Yale's self-description and stated purposes, 
the mythology,· rites and rhythms of Yale, when discer-
nable at all, are non-theistic. The student body is 
marvelously heterodox, there is no religious test for facul-
ty appointments, and a significant part of the student 
body acknowledges no religion at all. 

Whatever might have been the possibility of sustaining 
Yale's Calvinist Christian cohesiveness, that time is now 
past for both Yale and for the nation. Sound arguments 
can be offered for affirming the change and embracing a 
rich variety of ways of viewing ourselves. It means that we 
must find a new language. The time of reaction against 
opr reli!tious roots should be over and our defensiveness 
ended. It was not necessary for Payne-Whitney's Fall 
folder to be headed "Body and Mind." The classic for-
mulation, "Body, Mind, Spirit," is more accurate and 
need not imply theistic religion. The president, in naming 
what occurs at Yale, need no longer omit religious ser-
vices and events. More people are probably involved in 
some form of religious practice than are involved in 
athletics. It's just a fact, and there is no need to be defen-
sive about it. 

President Giamatti has made a good beginning in his 
Freshman Convocation and Baccalaureate addresses. The 
word civility has taken root. We have been encouraged to 
avoid apocalyptic boding and to affirm that we have a 
future, to accept our responsibility to society, to rejoice in 
our differences and to learn from one another, and to af-
firm the sciences within our liberal arts curriculum. Most 
of this language has not taken root among us. It has no 
liturgical valence and there are no humanist hymns by 
which to sing it, no rhythm that we should care to dance to 
it. _ M?reover, Yale College is not one college, but 
twelve. Except for one freshman experience, and one for 
seniors, we have found no way to gather: the great con-
gregation for the purpose of rehearsing our identity. 

It's not unreasonable to ask whether we even have a 
governance structure which allows for an inclusive discus-
sion of the things we value and of the ways in which we 
shall say it. Do the officers of the University ponder such 
matters? Are the dean of Yale College and the chaplain, 
the next ranked persons, included? Do masters and deans 
spend time searching the humanist tradition for adequate 
language and ceremonies? There is no evidence. 

There are areas in which Yale has spent energy on the 
question of what is to be valued. Concerning South 
Africa, we·have asked what it means to behave ethically. 
Concerning equal opportunity, we have spoken and 
acted, though often prompted by the commonwealth 
rather than leading it. In both areas we may have been 
equivocal, but we have tried to define ourselves in 
humanist language. On the other hand, we chose to ap-
proach the issues raised by Local 34 and the issues posed 
by the energy crisis largely from the standpoint of the nar-
rowly defined interests of the institution. 

One thing can be said for the various chaplains and the 
religious communities: There is little or no effort to press 
Yale to return to the days of Calvinist cohesion. On the 
other hand, the chaplains have not adequately appreci-
ated the difficulty which the University faces as it at-
tempts to replace Calvinism with humanism. Neither 
have the chaplains and members of the religious com-
munities said clearly enough how they see the world, the 
person, and the meaning of higher education. We have 
not well understood how our worship and pieties, feasts 
and acts of penitence, function for ourselves and what 
they contribute to the common life of humankind. 

Both the new chaplain and the new president have an 
important contribution to make to Yale's future self-
understanding. Hopefully, the process of shaping a new 
language, new rites and myths, will be shared by all the 
people of the University. The religious communities will 
always find humanism inadequate, lacking in numinous 
power, unnerved by evil, without processes of repentance 
and renewal, and with an inadequate history and future. 
But we can have the best of both: A university determined 
to clarify and rehearse what it values, and within it 
religious communities performing the role of responsible 
critic and themselves living and declaring what they con-
sider a more profound and adequate way.
