Down Under 
The dark, thickwalled buildings of this 
campus hold promises of morbid 
secrets: the ancient catacombs beneath 
the colleges, undiscovered corpses in 
the Sterling stacks, or voices echoing 
late at night in Commons. Sometimes 
reality is not so different. Enter Street 
Hall, descend the thin winding stairs, 
continue past the bathrooms, past the 
unused display cases and old filing 
cabinets, until you reach a Babylonian 
coffin. Turn to your right. You are 
now in the Yale University Art 
Gallery, facing the grave marker of 
John Trumbull, reknowned American 
painter and benefactor of Yale, who 
died in 1843. His bocfy is buried not 
far beneath your feet here. 

Why is Trumbull buried underneath 
the Gallery? He simply wanted to be. 
In 1831 Trumbull decided to donate a 
collection of 100 of his own paintings 
and miniatures to Yale, which was 
poore~; and in greater need of such art-
work than Harvard, his alma mater. 
His conditions, however, were that 
they be housed in a building of his own 
design, that he receive a $1000 annuity 
from the University, and that he be 
buried beneath the works after his 
death. Later that year the paintings 
moved into the completed Trumbull 
gallery, which stood on Old Campus. 
So did Trumbull's wife, who had died 
in 1824 and had been buried in New 
York. Thirteen years later Trumbull 
himself died and was buried next to his 
wife, underneath his paintings. But as 
the University evolved and the campus 
changed, the Trumbull collection 
moved around, and with it went the 
bodies of John and Sarah Trumbull-
to Street Hall in 1869 and to the Art 
Gallery in 1927. 

Still a central exhibit of the Gallery, 
the Trumbull collection receives many 
visitors. The tomb gets few. 
But

Colon ial painter John Trumbull demanded to be a permanent fixture at Yale. 
Trumbull's wish has been fulfilled. 
"John Trumbull always wanted to be 
under his pictures," said Carolyn 
Rollins, coordinator of publications, 
sales and membership at the Art 
Gallery. Any future plans for the 
Trumbull collection will inevitably 
have to include the graves also: where 
the paintings go, the Trumbulls go.
