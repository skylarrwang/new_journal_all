Bingham and his lawyers are determined to show there are more plawible explanations than the one held by the prosecution 
for the events of August 21, 1971. 
for being here," Bingham said in a soft, 
steady, oddly high voice that often 
seemed on the verge of cracking. "I've 
been back now for a year and a half, 
and it has amazed me that after being 
gone for 13 years, so many friends and 
family and new friends have rallied to 
support me. I could not get a fair trial 
without this help." 

On July 9, 1984 Stephen Mitchell 
Bingham, member of a prominent 
Connecticut family, radical attorney of 
the sixties, surrendered to the Marin 
County, California sheriff after 13 
years in hiding. He has returned to 
face trial- and gain acquittal- on five 
counts of murder and one count of 
conspiracy to murder for his alleged in-
volvement in a riot and an escape at-
tempt at San Quentin prison on 
August 21, 1971. Bingham disap-
peared that day shortly after leaving 
San Quentin, where he had visited 
Black Panther George Jackson, the 
most celebrated and closely watched 
prisoner in the United States at the 
time. According to prison guards and 
22 The New Journal/December 6, 1985 
authorities, Jackson had finished his 
visit with Bingham and was returning 
to his cell in the Adjustment Center, 
the maximum security ward in San 
Quentin, when he suddenly produced 
a gun and two clips of bullets from his 
hair. A chaotic and bloody escape at-
tempt then ensued, leaving three 
guards and two white prisoners dead 
inside the Adjustment Center. Jackson 
himself was shot and killed by a tower 
guard as he sprinted across the prison 
yard. The next day the papers an-
nounced that Bingham was the prime 
suspect for smuggling the gun to 
Jackson. By the end of the week, the 
District Attorney of Marin County 
claimed he had "conclusive evidence" 
of Bingham's guilt. Fearing that he was 
the victim of a conspiracy to kill 
Jackson, that his political activism had 
biased the state against him and that he 
could not get a fair trial under those 
circumstances, Bingham fled prosecu-
tion and almost certainly left the coun-
try. 

Today, the Marin County DA still 
maintains that Bingham supplied the 
gun to Jackson, making him a co-
conspirator in an escape attempt that 
caused 
five deaths. 
Released on 
$300,000 bail, Bingham went through 
lengthy preliminary hearings last 
March. The presiding judge decided 
that the prosecution has enough cir-
cumstantial evidence to warrant a 
trial. In early January, Bingham will 
be tried in a state that does not dif-
ferentiate between murder and ac-
cessory to murder; if found guilty, he 
could go to prison for life. 

Since his reemergence, Bingham has 
hired three full-time attorneys and has 
mounted a fundraising campaign to 
defray his defense expenses. The DA 
has pledged to give the case the 
"Cadillac treatment," forcing Bingham 
to match that effort with comprehen-
sive jury studies and handwriting and 
ballistic experts. 

To 
raise 
funds, 
Bingham has scheduled numerous 
receptions like the one in New York 
during which he can explain his case 
and make an appeal for help. 
At 
his Manhattan 
reception 

Bingham 
stated simply and im-
mediately that he is innocent. He held 
notes in front of him, yet rarely re-
ferred to them, knowing by heart how 
to avoid self-incrimination or damage 
to his defense. Although he would later 
discuss the case against him, he began 
instead with who he had been 20 years 
ago, calling himself a representative of 
"a time period badly understood. I 
am," he said, "typical of many people 
who got caught up in the idealism and 
hope for positive change in the late fif-
ties and early sixties." 

Indeed, Bingham comes from a 
background that fostered many of the 
young liberal intellectuals and activists 
of that era. Along with their wealth, 
the Binghams of Connecticut have a 
long history of prominent missionaries 
and politicians. 
His great-great-
grandfather, Hiram Bingham I , was 
the first missionary in Hawaii. His 
grandfather, Hiram III, a conservative 
Republican governor and U.S. senator 
from Connecticut, also discovered the 
lost Incan city of Machu Picchu. 
Bingham's father, Alfred, however, 
broke from the family's conservative 
political past. Before serving as a Con-
necticut state senator, Alfred Bingham 
founded and edited in the thirties a 
left-of-New Deal magazine called Com-
mon Sense. 
The youngest of four 
children, Stephen Bingham went to 
Milton Academy and then to Yale, 
where he became executive editor of 
the Yale Daily News. 
His four years at Yale coincided with 
the nationwide growth of the civil 
rights movement, 
and Bingham 
worked as the Daily's civil rights 
reporter. In the fall of 1963 Bingham 
joined a group of Yale and Stanford 
students organized by Allard Lowen-
stein which went to Mississippi to work 
on a mock gubernatorial election for 
black candidate Aaron Henry. That 
"Whenever anybody 
ends up dead, you 
look at the situation 
and say, Well who 
was mos~ interested in 
his being killed?'" 
fall Bingham 
was arrested in 
Clarksdale, and following his gradua-
tion in 1964, while working with the 
Mississippi Summer Project, he was 
beaten up in the town of Durant. That 
summer the whole country learned 
about the South's violent resistance to 
change when the FBI found three ac-
tivists dead on the side of a road in 
N eshoba County, Mississippi. 

Yet in 1964, most civil rights ac-
tivists, led by Martin Luther King, Jr. 
and the Student Nonviolent Coor-
dinating Committee (SNCC), still 
believed that change could come from 
within the system through non-violent 
protest. As part of this movement, 
Bingham enrolled that fall in Boalt 
Hall Law School of the University of 
California at Berkeley. After marrying 
in 1965 he volunteered for the Peace 
Corps and spent an 
apparently 
frustrating year-and-a-half in Sierra 
Leone. He returned to law school at 
Berkeley two years later, perhaps less 
idealistic, but still determined to do his 
part for the movement on a smaller, 
more effective scale than in the Peace 
Corps. 

From 1967 to 1971, as fervent anti-
war demonstrations and the revolu-
tionary Black Power movement 
disrupted the Bay area, Bingham con-
tinued his quiet activism. 
While 
Bingham himself was involved Â·in the 
causes of the time, he helped establish 
legal defense committees to assist 
students who had been harassed, 
beaten, or arrested during peaceful 
protests on campus. He also organized 
a project which brought together law 
and medical students to look after the 
health and safety of workers in the San 
Joaquin Valley. 

After 
taking the 
California bar exam in 1969 he settled 
in Oakland in a "collective-commune" 
with several other young lawyers (he 
was now divorced) and started work 
with the Berkeley Neighborhood Legal 
Service Program, concentrating on 
housing issues and landlord-tenant 
relationships among the poor. 

Although he adhered to a belief in 
peaceful activism, Bingham saw 
violence grow commonplace around 
him. He asserts, 
however, 
that 
chroniclers of the sixties have placed 
responsibility for the violence on ex-
tremist movements, ignoring or 
down playing the role of officially sanc-
tioned brutality. He cites Kent State, 
Jackson State, People's Park, and 
Neshoba County as examples of police 
violence against activists that led to un-
necessary death. 

By emphasizing the often unsavory 
role of the authorities, Bingham in-
troduces a main contention of his 
defense. The prosecution's case against 
him rests upon circumstantial evidence 
that suggests George Jackson could 
only have obtained a gun that after-
noon through Bingham, the last out-
sider with Jackson before the escape at-
tempt. But Bingham and his lawyers 
are determined to show that there are 
other possible 
explanations- more 
plausible than the one held by the pros-
ecution- for the events of that day at 
San Quentin.
