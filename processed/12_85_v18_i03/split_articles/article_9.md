everything that goes wrong, much to 
the annoyance of the workers. When 
approached by a student who said, 
"This knife isn't clean," one worker 
meticulously cleaned it off with his own 
shirt. Then he handed it back to the 
dissatisfied student, saying, "No prob-
lem. Sir." 

Because of the daily complaints and 
tensions, some workers flee all student 
contact and head for the safety of the 
dish-room, which requires, I've heard, 
a very specific, highly-tuned tempera-
ment and skill. Not everyone can do it. 
For some, the pressure is just too in-
tense and the line of trays seems 
endless. For others, successful dish-
room performance is a physical im-
possibility. If you're too short, you 
can't reach everything. However, a 
select few thrive amidst the steam and 
water. Dave Carpenter, SM '86, has 
worked in the Berkeley dining hall for 
the past year. "I like to work in the 
dishroom. I listen to Miracle Legion or 
Gang of Four," Carpenter explained 
seriously. "It's an autonomous zone. I 
mean I don't have to deal with 
students, and I have a pretty good rap-
port with the cooks, depending on their 
moods." 

I heard of one student whose perfor-
mance was legendary- he could do it 
all with one hand. Yet even dish-room 
workers are not cut off from all student 
input. Last summer in Berkeley, a 
note was sent to the dishroom written 
in a maniacal hand that said, "Never 
serve this shit again." Somebody else 
once wrote, "This food would gag a 
vulture." 

As students struggle with the prob-
lems inherent in serving and working 
with peers, regular workers search for 
ways to deal with Yale and its students. 
Lisa Gavoni, wide-eyed, funny, and 
approachable, has worked in Berkeley 
as a desk-attendant for the past two 
years. Born in New Haven 18 years 
ago, Lisa explains that many workers 
have held the same impressions of and 
attitudes toward Yale for long over 20 
years. "A lot of people in New Haven 
just see big iron 
gates and tall 
buildings," she said, greeting most 
students by name as they passed her 
desk. "It is seen as a big, spooky place, 
one you'll never get to see. Yale owns 
three-quarters of New Haven and 
everybody knows that." 

Johnny Edwards, another Berkeley 
employee, has been a cook with the 
Yale dining hall system for the past 13 
years. In describing his situation with 
the Yale management, Edwards spoke 
with a sense of urgency. "Lots of 
workers feel they should be promoted," 
he 
said, 
his eyes 
flashing. 
"But 
sometimes it seems impossible." 

Edwards strongly advocates chan-
ging the current system and challeng-
ing the procedural standard. "Yale 
forces workers to take a written test to 
be promoted," Edwards continued, 
"but many of us were hired a long time 
before the test. I don't know. I don't 
think I will ever pass- it's far beyond 
my reach." He cannot quit because he 
does not have a document qualifying 
him to be a chef in the real world. In 
other words, Johnny Edwards can't get 
a job in a restaurant or anywhere else 
outside of Yale. 

Ed Huff, assistant director for the 
Yale College dining hall system, ap-
peared accommodating and casual as he 
coolly offered me coffee in his office on 
Elm Street. A black and white photo-
graph of a dining hall filled with smil-
ing Yale men-wearing dark suits and 
waiting to be served- hung over his 
desk. Huff does not see any inequities 
in 
the system as it now exists: 
"Management has requirements for 
each position, depending on someone's 
education and work experience." 

Although trying to approach the issues 
fairly, Huff is caught within the wheels 
of Yale's immense machinery. "The 
test is just one small part of a whole 
series of things, including perfor-
mance, appraisals, and adult-school at-
tendance." 

While listening to this man speak, I 
remembered the frustrated look on Ed-
wards's face when he told me he had no 
more options. Asked whether it is 
discriminatory to base advancement in 
blue-collar jobs on reading skills or 
quantity of education, 
Huff only 
answered, "Look, it's a very touchy 
subject among the workers. We have a 
couple of grievances on that right 
now." 

What about Yale's refusal to write 
recommendations? Huff hesitated. He 
looked down at his hands. "We just 
don't deal with the question about 
whether an employee is good, bad, or 
indifferent. Management doesn't want 
to get involved in that." 

The reasons for the tense relations 
between workers and management go 
beyond rules and figures. Discrimina-
tion, though seldom linked openly to 
the dining hall system, is a serious 
underground 
issue. 
One student-
worker said, "The cooks ask the guys to 
do everything. If a woman comes in 
and works a shift, she's hassled by 
them. It's not direct, just 'work-place' 
intimidation." One regular worker 
then asked if I had ever noticed how 
few whites worked in the dining halls. 
She explained that for decades she has 
watched whites enter the dining hall 
system, work there for a year or two, 
and then be promoted automatically to 
higher-paying physical plant or 
grounds 
maintenance jobs. 
Other 
employees feel even more strongly. 
"Management is racist and demoraliz-
ing," a long-time regular-worker ex-
pressed. "They don't realize that being 
nasty and over-demanding causes peo-
ple to do the bare necessity. They 
basically consider workers to be stupid 
children, and we become their pawns." 

Locked into one position at Yale with no 
options on the outside 

The resentments and anxieties that 
dining hall employees experience while 
working for Yale are also reflected in 
their relationships with both non-
working and working students. Desk-
attendants find themselves in a par-
ticularly ironic situation, for while they 
encounter every student in the college, 
they are the most routinely ignored. 
Yolanda Jackson, who has been a desk-
attendant for the past 10 years, has 
found her own solution: she knows 
how to put the fear of God into people. 
Because of her reputation, I was 
somewhat wary of her when we first 
spoke. We checked each other out. "I 
don't want to see my name in that arti-
cle," she warned, her eyebrows raised. 
Yet after talking several times, we both 
softened. I learned that she not only 
met her husband in Berkeley dining 
hall, but her mother also works in the 
system. She finally broke down, off-
handedly telling me, "Oh ... by the 
way, I don't really care if you include 
my name. Go ahead and quote me. It's 
okay." 

Although he understands that the 
main priority of student-workers is 
their education, it still bothers Johnny 
Edwards that they are not more open 
to the regular staff. Staring at the grey-
ing tiles of the kitchen wall, Edwards 
said, "Most students don't realize that 
we can be friends." Many of the full-
time employees are not very anxious to 
pick up relationships with students. 
They know that they may spend time 
getting to know someone who will 
leave the job three months later. Al-
though this happens often, it isn't 
always the case. Thad Bouchard, MC '87, worked in the Morse-Stiles dining 
halls for two years before he was confi-
dent in speaking with John, the pot 
scrubber. "One day he asked me, sort 
of dejectedly, 'You're a senior this year, 
aren't you?'" Bouchard said. "When I 
told him I was only a sophomore, his 
whole face lit up." 

Despite these conflicts, most dining 
hall workers said they don't want to 
find jobs outside of Yale. Student-
workers stay primarily because of the 
high wage. Most regular workers stay 
for union benefits or because they are 
not qualified for other types of employ-
ment. Yet people continue to work in 
the dining halls for other reasons as 
well. Since workers share common ex-
periences and a common disdain for 
the frequent thoughtlessness of people 
they encounter, very tight bonds often 
develop between them. "We're a very 
close-knit group," Jackson admitted. 
"The majority of the workers have 
been here a long time, and the students 
can be really pleasant." Then she 
raised an eyebrow skeptically. "But 
there are still days when nothing's set 
up for breakfast, because a student 
must leave early for a test." 

She smiled. "You learn to expect it." 

Rob Pierce, BK '86, student co-
ordinator at Berkeley, approached her 
desk. When asked how he'd change the 
current dining hall system if he were 
given the opportunity, Pierce was 
quiet for several moments before 
replying. "Well, if I were in charge of 
the world," he mused, looking at 
Yolanda, "the Co-op would be a real 
cooperative, 
and 
I 
would have 
everyone at Yale work in the dining 
hall for a while. Then maybe they 
wouldn't abuse us so much." Yolanda 
nodded in agreement.
