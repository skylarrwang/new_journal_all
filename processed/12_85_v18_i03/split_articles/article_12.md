AlA Executive Director Caorba labels questions over AlA's validity as resiatance from 
"paranoid" professors. 

One of AlA's major concerns is simply 
establishing the group's right to exist. 
Media coverage of AlA has questioned 
the validity of external interference with 
academic freedom. Csorba attributed 
this to "paranoid" professors resisting 
AlA's calls for balance. "In a year or two 
we'll just be a standing presence and 
people will accept what we're doing as 
legitimate," he said. "We're not going to 
go away." 

I wonder. So far, AlA has raised 
over $50,000, mostly from subscribers 
to the AIM newsletter. The group's an· 
nual budget is $162,000, including 10 
newsletters per year and staff fees. But 
Csorba told me that the newsletters 
would be sent to 40,000 people. Sub-
tracting staff fees from the budget, 
there is no way AlA can afford 400,000 
newsletters. They planned to charge 
non-students $25 a year for the news-
letter, but I doubt they'll get that many 
subscribers. Other financial backers 
can be found; AIM seems willing to 
support them for some time, and there 
is plenty of conservative foundation 
money to be had. 

But I don't know what AlA could 
spend that money on, except to raise 
more money and to tap into the New 
Right network. AlA claims to have 500 
representatives on 110 campuses, but 
that only means people who wrote in or 
called, and who haven't necessarily 
done any more spying than I have. At 
the rate reports have come in, there 
just isn't enough for a staff of 15 (AlA's 
initial projection for 1988) to do even if 
AlA could pay them. As it is, the job of 
AlA president is basically 
a 
figurehead, and Scully was brought in 
mainly for the Reader case. Which 
leaves Csorba, alone in his office, 
phoning professors 18 times. 

Simply put, AlA has so little to do 
because the target it seeks doesn't exist. 
Their model for the academic Marxist 
is Oilman, who has been quoted as 
saying his task "is to make more 
revolutionaries." No professor I spoke 
with thinks there are more than a 
handful of such academics. "There are

doing as legitimate. 
We're not going to go 
away." 

a few socialist faculty members," said 
David Apter, professor of economic 
and social development at Yale, "but I 
don't see them having much of an im-
pact, and it is absurd to think that they 
indoctrinate students." 

Elizabeth Mahan agrees. For three 
years, she was program coordinator 
for the Yale Center for International 
and Area Studies. She is also on Csor-
ba's target list, and I was told to "check 
her out." Now at the University of 
Connecticut, she was amused to find 
out that "I'm a threat to the social 
order." She said she has "never profess-
ed to be a Marxist" and that her 
teaching and writing "stand on their 
own. Very few of my colleagues," she 
said, "are so wedded to their own ideas 
that they cannot allow students to ex-
press their own." 

Like most senior faculty with whom 
I spoke, Mahan doesn't take AlA very 
seriously. She feels "more annoyed 
than threatened," and thinks the group 
will probably fade away. Commented 
another professor, "These things tend 
to break out in rashes, and they come 
and go." Academic groups, such as the 
Association of American University 
Professors, have denounced AlA as 
"reminiscent of McCarthy" and "an in-
tellectual goon squad." Others have 
charged that the press gave undue 
publicity- and legitimacy- to AlA by 
reporting their existence before they 
actually accused a professor of bias. 

Such groups insist that anyone is
