succeeded by what? By jeers or even a 
hail of pebblestones? Not inevitably. 
That one was a fraud did not have to 
mean that one was vicious. Perhaps one 
had to be a fraud. Why? Did there have 
to be an answer? 

In the other half of the chapters, 
Auchincloss turns the story over to 
Chip's wife, Alida, who "takes pen to 
paper" and writes in the first person. 
Before Alida's marriage to Chip, she is 
a sharp, independent, ferociously am-
bitious woman (Debutante of the 
Year), quite unlike the drunken lap dog 
she 
becomes. 
Conditioned by 
domesticity, she learns to wag her tail 
for Chip's 
presence, mid-morning 
cocktails, and "the blessed narcotic of 
bridge." This contrast is frustrating 
because Auchincloss doesn't offer suffi-
cient explanation for her transforma-
tion. Chip may somehow have reduced 
her to a weakling, despite the fact that 
she seemed more than a match for him 
when they were courting. The insuffi-
cient explanation · of Alida's decline 
suggests that, after introducing her as a 
driving force, Auchincloss decided to 
downplay her dynamic role in the story 
so that he could concentrate on Chip. · 
The once-honorable woman remains 
i!l the book, but her narrative con-
'ri-ibutions are no longer trenchant, but 
merely fatuous and self-pitying. "And 
what was left of me," she asks, "but a 
shivering, naked, crouching figure 
whose G-String of a soul-saving per-
sonal resentment had been brutally 
snatched away?" The double-narrator 
technique would have been much more 
effective if Alida had remained consis-
tent. As it is, she does not make a 
believable victim. 

The dialogue 
i n 
Honorable 
Men is like a series of prepared 
speeches. 
In 
one 
scene 
a 
15-year-old boy says to Chip, "1 ask 
you, Tarzan, have you ever seen such 
a collection of bilious crones as our 
cleaning women? They say your 
grandfather inspects each candidate for 
the job. That old boy must have a 
depth of concupiscence to spot so 
precisely the attributes in a female that 
would make the most sex-starved boy 
vomit!" At times conversations sound 
like the Hardy Boys acting 
sophisticated. Here, Chip and his col-
lege roommate are discussing their 
parents: 

They don't really think I'll make it. 
They think I'm going to trip and break 
my stupid neck!" 
"Which would really mean breaking 
theirs?" 
"Ah, you see it too!" cried Chip, strik-
ing the arm of his chair. "It's true of their 
whole damn generation, teachers as well 
as parents. When Tinker slobbers about 
the drowning of Shelley, don't you know 
that he's keeping his good eye on you? 
He's afraid you might think he's a ghast-
ly ham 'al'ld that Percy Bysshe was an ass 
to go samng in a storm., 

Occasionally, Auchincloss assaults his 
reader with blunt symbolism. For ex-
ample, as Chip watches two bald eagles 
in their aviary at the zoo, he thinks to 
himself, "these huge birds expressed 
the dilemma of the times. What could 
they do but fly helplessly to and fro bet-
ween the moral cause and the practical 
horror, encaged in the limitations of 
the soul?" 

Despite these flaws in the structure 
of the novel, the premise of Honorable 
Men is valuable: extreme Calvinism 
can produce a destructive moral rigi-
dity. Chip believes he serves some sort 
of heroic cause when he betrays his 
friel!ds, his wife, and his parents. This 
paradox, as a comment on the relation-
ship between humans and faith, is by 
far the most interesting part of the 
novel. Yet Auchincloss struggles to 
build his fiction around this idea. 

Perhaps, if Auchincloss sees C hip as 
his alter-ego, then it is Chip who offers 
the story's message: "if you can deal 
with the world as it is, you can handle 
truth, and if you can handle truth, 
you're free." With Honorable Men, we 
must get past the fiction before we 
come to the truth.
