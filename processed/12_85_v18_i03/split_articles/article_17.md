on August 21, 1971? Official reports of 
what happened that day seem to sug-
gest no other alternative. Convicted of 
a $71 robbery as a teenager, Jackson 
had spent 11 years in California 
prisons and was scheduled to go to trial 
once more, this time for murder, on 
August 23, 1971, just two days after 
his death. While in Soledad prison, he 
became known for his efforts at 
organizing black inmates against the 
institutionalized racism of the Califor-
nia prison system. On January 30, 
1970 three black inmates were killed by 
a prison sharpshooter during a "riot" in 
the Soledad prison yard. Blacks and 
whites had been put in1 the yard 
together, something never done in 
prisons because of the potential for 
interracial fighting. 

To many, 
Bingham included, this was a conscious 
effort to encourage a riot which would 
justify the firing of shots-and the 
deaths of three prisoners- in reestab-
lishing order. One of the three men 
killed was W.L. 
Nolen, another 
outspoken member of the prison 
reform movement and a close friend of 
Jackson. 

A week later, Jackson and two other 
black inmates, collectively dubbed the 
"Soledad brothers," were charged with 
throwing a white guard off a railing to 
his death, and transferred to San Quen-
tin to await trial. The Soledad killings 
were already drawing public attention 
when, in late 1970, a collection of 
Jackson's prison letters entitled Soledad 
Brother was published. The book, with 
an 
introduction by Jean Genet, 
brought Jackson international recogni-
tion as the leader-from-within of the · 
movement, 
the 
new 
cause 
adopted by both the Black Panthers 
and more moderate civil rights ac-
tivists. At the same time, Huey 
Newton, the leader of the Black Pan-
ther party who had just been released 


from prison, made Jackson his "field 
marshall," giving him theoretical con-
trol of the more militant, revolutionary 
wing of the party and increasing his 
public prominence. 

The Black Panther party was behind 
the rise of prison reform, a movement 
which took hold as news of civil rights 
activity and its gains infiltrated prison 
walls in the late sixties. At that time, 
Panther leaders Huey Newton, Bobby 
Seale, Eldridge Cleaver and, finally, 
George Jackson were either in prison, 
wanted by authorities or facing trial. 

On the inside, men like Newton and 
Jackson organized prisoners against 
the use of inhumane treatment and 
racial tension as means of control, por-
traying the black prisoner as a victim 
of the system. On the outside, sym-
pathetic lawyers were constantly 
visiting prisoners and successfully en-
couraging journalists and civil rights 
leaders to do the same. 

As a radical attorney working in the 
Bay area, Stephen Bingham was 
drawn into the prison movement 
around 1970. "I was not involved in 
the prison movement in any large 
degree, but was recruited for sparse 
work on a pro bono basis," Bingham 
said. "The National Lawyers Guild 
had a support network which, among 
other things, provided a minimal 
amount of legal help to the Panthers, 
particutarly those who were afraid of 
police raids on their offices and things 
like that. But my main work was legal 
services in Berkeley, and so it really 
was not the kind of thing that, other 
than in an almost symbolic way-just 
to give a little free help here and 
there-! got involved in." 

"However, I Juui visited George 
Jackson four or five times [over a seven 
month period] to discuss the filing of a 
federal civil rights suit charging in-
human conditions at the infamous San 
Alfred Bingham: the start of a family rebellion againet conservatism. 
Quentin Adjustment Center, the max-
imum security section which had 23 Y2 
hour lockup, neck chains and ankle 
chains, strip cells and use of tear gas." 

Evidence supports Bingham's claim 
that he visited San Quentin on August 
21 to discuss the civil suit and that he 
had no other business that day, legal or 
otherwise, withJackson: he had never 
been listed as the inmate's attorney of 
record, nor had he arranged permis-
sion prior to the visit to see Jackson. 

The prosecutor in Bingham's up-
coming trial, Assistant Marin County 
DA Terrence Boren, charges, 
however, that Bingham and Jackson 
wer~ co-conspirators in the plan to 
escape. Yet he apparently has made no 
effort to prove the existence of a rela-
tionship 
between 
Bingham and 
Jackson nor between Bingham and the 
Black Panthers that explains 
Bingham's involvement in such a plan. 

Instead, the state bases its case upon 
the circumstantial evidence. Because 
Bingham was the last visitor to see 
Jackson alive, because, according to 
prison authorities, the gun "could not 
have come from the guards" and it 
"could not have come from the prison," 
and because, according to the guards, 
Jackson 
was 
strip-searched before 
entering the visiting room and the gun 
was discovered during the strip-search 
after his visit, the DA maintains that 
"there was no other wa'/' Jackson could 
have gotten the gun. 

The state does have other evidence 
to use against Bingham. First, a letter 
said to have been discovered by a dry 
cleaner in pants belonging to Jimmy 
Carr, a close friend of J ackson, was
