Sound Effects 
Ten-year-olds sing along to Prince's 
"Darling Nikki," whose heroine is 
described as a "sex fiend." Their 
younger siblings, meanwhile, may 
learn about first love from bands like 
Motley Criie, who portray women as 
territory to be conquered. Certainly, 
rock music, with its often sexual or 
violent connotations, plays a part in 
the lives of many pre-teenagers. But do 
these uncensored lyrics really have a 
detrimental effect on the minds of 
young listeners? The Parents' Music 
Resource Center (PMRC), a lobbying 
group headquartered in Washington 
D.C., believes so. Two Yale research-
ers, however, disagree. Any affect 
lyrics have on teenagers may have little 
to do with records and tapes. Instead, 
studies made here provide a possible 
link between videos and aggressive 
behavior in children. 

"A lot of people have studied rock 
lyrics, and they haven't been able to 
find any effects at all- no effects on 
socialization, for instance," Dr. R oger 
Desmond, a visiting fellow of the Yale 
department of psychology, told The 
New 
York 
Timts. 
Desmond, 
who 
specializes in the relationship between 
children and the media, has completed 
several studies examining the influence 
of rock lyrics. He describes his work as 
the study of "how mass media operate 
as agents of socialization for young 
children." 

A study he conducted four years ago 
compared the perception of rock lyrics 
by institutionalized adolescents to non-
institutionalized ones. Children with 
criminal records are more likely to 
hear messages in the music that aren't 
really there, he determined. "They 
feel, for example, that 'The Doors are 
speaking to me.'" Such conclusions in-
dicate, then, that heeding lyrics l:on-
sidered offensive is only a manifesta-

tion of violent adolescent behavior, not 
its cause. 

Desmond's findings are particularly 
significant in view of the recent con-
troversy involving PMRC, which ad-
vocates a rating system for records 
comparable to that imposed on films. 
Discs containing potentially offensive 
material, the group argues, should be 
stamped with an "X" to warn parents of 
their sexual or violent content. 

Dorothy Singer, co-director of the 
Yale Family Television Research and 
Consultation Center which studies the 
effects of television programming on 
the public, agrees with Desmond. 
"Kids are caught into the sound-the 
rhythm, the beat." Singer said. "Usual-
ly they're doing something else while 
listening to the music, like homework. 
They're not really paying attention to 
the lyrics." 

One reason for these attempts to 
curb rock lyrics may be the advent of 
music videos, which can take vague or 
unintelligible lyrics and transform 
them into something more graphic 
onscreen. Singer explained that the 
Center's 
content analyses 
studies 
count the number of gratuitous sexual 
or violent acts per video. Figures for 
such acts generally have been found to 
be quite high. 

Singer's studies on the effects of TV 
programming on young children have 
lead her to a grim conclusion: "There is 
a relationship between aggressive pro-
gramming and aggressive acts." 

Although Singer won't venture an 
opinion, perhaps music videos have 
harmful effects on young children. If 
this is the case, it would seem that the 
PMRC has attacked 
the wrong 
medium. So far, the group has failed to 
initiate successfully a national rating 
system on albums and tapes, despite 
the favorable conservative political 
climate. It just may be that scientific 
evidence is not on its side.
