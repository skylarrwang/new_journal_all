EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Professors to Be Monitored for L¢tism 
That Washington Post headline caught 
my eye on August 4, 1985. I read that a 
new group called 
Accuracy in 
Academia (AlA) planned to weed out 
"10,000 known Marxists" on American 
college campuses. Malcolm Lawrence, 
president of AlA, vowed to seek out and 
publicize "political bias baaed on in· 
correct information" in the classroom. 
The article- accompanied by a photo of 
a smiling Lawrence- named Bertell 
Oilman of New York University and 
filmmaker/instructor Saul Landau as 
examples of professors AlA would 
monitor. 


As a student, I found it hard to 
believe that there were that many 
Marxist professors. I also wondered 
how AlA would decide which courses to 
monitor. So the next day I called AlA; I 
managed to reach Lawrence at home. 
At first, he was evasive and reluctant to 
say too much. 
"How large is the organization? " I 
asked. 
"'We11 be appointing an executive 
director this week," he replied in his 
deep, authoritative voice. So far it was 
just him. 
"'Which campuses do you plan to 
monitor?" 
"'WelJ, we're not going to zero in on 
specific schools. 
We're waiting for 
students to come to us with reports." 
I told him that I was a senior at Yale 
and asked if they planned to be active 
on my campus. 
"You're a student?" he asked. "Would 
you be interested in being our Yale con· 
tact?" 
I was taken aback. Lawrence didn't 
ask whether I knew of any instances of 
Marxism, he didn't ask if I approved of 
the group, he didn't even ask about my 
political leanings. Not thinking it would 
amount to anything, I agreed and gave 
him my phone number and school ad· 
dress. Lawrence assured me someone 
would be in touch. For the next four 
months, I would be a liberal infiltrator 
of the New Right: I was a spy for Ac· 
curacy in Academia. 


AlA is a spinoff of a similar group, Ac· 
curacy in Media (AIM). Since 1969, 
AIM has targeted a purported liberal 
bias in American media. Working out 
of Washington, AIM uses its 11.7 
mi)}jon annual budget to monitor the 
press and television for slanted 
coverage. AIM President Reed Irvine 
has gained respectabiltity through his 
frequent appearances on ABC's 
Nightline and other television programs. 
Though best known for its two-hour 
rebuttal to Stanley Karnow's Emmy 1
award-winning Vietnam: A Television 
History, 
which AIM labelled "good 
propaganda for the communists," AIM

diacovered these biases, AIM 
asked itself about the ~;>rigin 
strong tilt. In August, they an 
nounced the answer: leftist acaaemia. 
AIM created a new arm to "end the 
brainwashing"-AJA.. The new ~up 
would "tackle the root 13{ the problem, 
the indoctrination of our future jour-
nalists and otqer members of qqr 
society." Voluntl!er students and senior 
citizens-who can take courses Cree of 
charge at manystate universities-were 
asked to report "problem courses." AlA 
recognized that "young, impreaaionable 
students" are reluctant to criticize a pro-
fessor who might Ounk them, so it 
promised t{) keep the identity of ita stu-
dent monitors secret. 


In the extensive media coverage 
s_i' A.IA sin~ August, the ~up has 
CJte(l a dozen or so "biased" professors. 
The first student report concerned Dr. 
Mark R eader, professor of political 
science at Arizona State University, 
who teaches an introductory survey 
course on ~litical ideologic.$. AfA's first 
newsletter \leaked to the press weeks 
before it was published) cijarges R~er 
with teaching only his own "obsessions: 
anti-nuclear propaganda and 
fringe economics." An anonymous stu-
dent ~so quoted Reader as saying that 
"the Soviet Union is no threat compared 
to the United States's imperial aggres-
sions. • (Reader denies saying this, 
though he claims if he did say it, he had 
every right to do so.) In ttempting (o 
substantiate the charge, AlA call¢d 
Reader 18 times, wrote hitn a registered 
letter, and contacted the chair of his 
department. AlA has also asked its sup-
porten to write letters asking ASU 
President J. Russell Nelson to change 
the •deceptive labeling" of Reader's 
course in th'e college catalog. 


It ia no accident that R<*ier is AlA's 
fli'St target; the campaigrl against him 
&gan before AlA was ~m. Matthew 
Scu.lzy, former editorials editor of the 
ASU Sla/4 Press, wrote a series of col-
umns last year criticizing R~s 
class 
and his •all-consuming dr~d of nuclear 
war." ScuUy, now graduat~, is national 
director of f-IA, a fact their newsletter 
failed to report. 


In addition to Scully, AIA has at-
tracted an impressive cast of characten, 
despite its short history. Their 
backgrounds cast doubt on the group's 
ability to promote "balance." Lawrence, 
60, whose presidency officially expired 
November 30, is a retired Foteign Ser-
vice officer who once served as a consul-
tant to the Department of Education 
during Reagan's first term. He is best 
known as author of a form letter p&lent• 
can send to 3Cbool boards requesting 
that 'parents review all ~vant mater' 
before teachen discuss over 35 issues 
with students. The broad range o 
topics includes abortion, drugs a,nd 
alcohol, 
evolution, 
sex education, 
"values clarification," "Eastern 
mysticism," diaries or personal jour-
nals, and nuclear policy. Since january, 
two million copies of the letter have 
been di$tributed by evangelist Pat 
Robertaon's 700 Club, the Moral Ma-
jority, and Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle 
Forum. 


Lawrence's replacement as president 
is John LeBoutillier ~ 31, an outspoken 
former congressman from Long Island. 
He is the author of HarvtR'd Ha~ 
America, a polemic against the leftism 
and decadence he saw at his alma 
mater. LeBoutillier's escapades during 
his one House term won him natiqnal 
attention: he once called 
fel1ow 
Republican Charles Percy a "wimp" and 
an "idiot," and labelled Speaker Tip 
O'Neill "big, fat, and out of control. •
