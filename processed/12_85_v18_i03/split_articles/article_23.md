you do is knock off the top 15 people 
from General Dynamics and everyone 
else stays in place. Then you put the 
contract up for competitive bidding. If 
any other contractor saw that, they'd 
think, 'H oly shit, if we screw around 
with the Army or the Air Force, we 
may be the next one."' 

"That would be nationalizing one of 
the two yards which can build sub-
marines," O'Brien counters. 
" It 
wouldn't be practical and it was never 
seriously considered." 

In truth, Stockton's plan would 
hardly lead to the kind of nationaliza-
tion O'Brien fears. But given GD's in-
fluence with Congress and the Pen-
tagon, O'Brien is right about the im-
practicality of such a move. The com-
pany would certainly exert all its con-
siderable influence to prevent any 
takeover. Many politicians would fight 
such a move by claiming that the in-
valuable Trident program would be 
jeopardized. C learly, the takeover of a 
defense corporation with nine billion 
dollars in government contracts will 
never happen while Ronald Reagan is 
president. 

What then could the Navy have done 
to teach GD a lesson? There are plausi-
ble options. Besides forcing the com-
pany to withdraw its fraudulent ex-
pense claims, the Navy could have 
fined General Dynamics so heavily 
that GD (and every other defense con-
tractor) would hesitate to try cheating 
the government. 

Perhaps the most effective way to 
punish a corporation is to punish the 
individuals who run it. There are any 
number of charges the Navy a nd 
Justice Department could levy against 
G D officials in court- fraud being the 
m ost obvious, 
treason 
the 
most 
serious. And if company officials were 
held personally liable for their law-
breaking decisions, then they would be 
less likely to make such moves. 

"The problem 
with 
white-collar 
crime is that it's often profitable to 
cheat now because you may not have 
to pay later," New Haven Con-
gressman Bruce Morrison says. Mor-
rison is a member of the House Sub-
Co~mittee on Crime, which is holding 
heanngs on General Dynamics early 
next year. "I am appalled at the notion 
of individuals getting off while com -
panies pay the price," Morrison says. 
"That's not the way to control white-
collar crime, that's the way to promote 
it. And 1 am by no means satisfied with 
the way this case has been handled." 

General D ynamics' future is still far 
from 
secure. 
Both Proxmire and 
Dingle are continuing their investiga-
tions into the company. Newport News 
may bid for and win the next Trident 
contract. In Greece, Takis Veliotis says 
he has not revealed his most damaging 
tapes. General Dynamics Vice· 
~re~ident George Sawyer was recently 
mdtcted by the Justice Department· 
Sawy~r. is 
~harged with secret!; 
negottattng wtth GD for a job while 
still in his post as assistant secretary of 
the Navy. In that position Sawyer 
presided over the awarding of some 
five billion dollars in contracts to GD. 

But on the financial side, things 
don't look bad at all for General 
Dynamics. A recent report by Barron's, 
a financial weekly, predicted "further 
and substantial gains" for GD stock on 
its nine billion dollars in earnings. 
Next year that figure should top $10 
billion. Barron's conclusion? General 
Dynamics is "bloody but unbowed." If 
they're right, and GO's profits continue 
to grow, then there's no reason to ex-
pect any significant change in the way 
General Dynamics conducts its 
business. 

What is perhaps mos~ frustrating 
about this situation is that there is no 
easy villain- not General Dynamics, 
not the Navy, not Capitoi Hill. As 
Senator Proxmire says, "It's hard to 
blame the people involved as much as 
the system." As long as the United 
States is committed to building 
weapons like the Trident, there will 
always be scandals like this one. There 
is just too much money involved, too 
much temptation to cheat, too much 
that falls through the cracks. For many 
of the people involved, the problem of 
defense fraud is a secondary considera-
tion. The important thing is simply 
that the weapom get built. But the 
widespread corruption and dishearten-
ing amorality of the defense industry 
make you wonder. If you can't trust 
the detenders of America with your 
money, should you trust them with 
your life?
