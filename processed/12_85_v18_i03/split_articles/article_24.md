Honorable Men 
by Louis Auchincloss 
1985 Houghton Miffiin Company 
$15.95, 278 pages 

Revisionists o ften 
expose the 
weaknesses and corruptions of the peo-
ple who were once our heroes- they 
reveal our champions as rascals and 
our supermen as boys. Babe Ruth, 
alas, was a lush; J ohn F. Kennedy, it 
seems, preferred blondes. But in his 
new novel, 
Honorable Men, 
Louis 
Auchincloss smashes his idol even as 
he builds it. Despite a heavy-handed 
approach, Honorable Men is an intrigu-
ing and often disturbing study of an 
American "hero" and why he fails. 

The 
hero, 
Chip 
Benedict, 
has 
credentials similar enough to those 
of Auchincloss to suggest 
that 
Chip may be the author's grim self-
parody. Their resumes are almost 
interchangeable: like Auchincloss, 
Chip went to a New England prep 
school, graduated from Yale in 1938 
(Auchincloss was '39), attended the 
University of Virginia Law School, 
and served with the Navy's amphibious 
fleet during WW II. They both began 
their legal careers with Wall Street 
firms and went on to direct cultural 
organizations in 
New York City. 

Author Auchincloss: creating a handsome, rich, well-educated yet tormented hero 

Despite his highly distinguished 
public career, however, Chip disap-
points himself. Although he was leader 
of his class at Yale, decorated for 
bravery in the war, and praised as a 
businessman by Forbts and Fortune, he 
sees himself as a "moral crook." The 
novel unearths a side of Chip's con-
science that may apply to the cons-
cience of the American elite in general: 
Chip is smart, 
handsome, 
well-
educated and rich, yet he is tortured by 
the expectations of his class. 

Chip's upbringing emphasized the 
principle that "people who have been 
born with certain privileges . . . are 
therefore bound to contribute more 
than average to their fellow men." 

Chip wants to be righteous, but he's 
not quite sure how to do it. By creating 
glib shortcuts through every moral 
issue to bypass what he sees as his in-
herent "wickedness", Chip fails to 
distinguish honor from decency. Thus, 
even dilemmas like the war in Vietnam 
become simple problems with simple 
solutions .... 
â€¢can't you see that this is the first real 
moral challenge we've had since Pearl 
Harbour? And that we've actually 
elected to meet it without using the 
bomb? That we've chosen to fight not a 
war, but a duel, and with prescribed 
weapons? We, who could annihilate 
Hanoi with a single blow! It's .. . well, 
it's magnificent! It restores honor to a 
cynical globe. 

It's as if Chip has learned his morality 
by rote -
he wields aphorisms like 
tarnished swords of justice. For exam-
pie, when his best friend submits a 
plagiarized article to the Law School 
Review, Chip forces him to with-
draw from the University. "It's not a 
question of forgiveness," Chip says, 
"We took the pledge to observe the 
honor code when we came down here." 

For aJI his apparent insensitivity, Chip 
seems fundamentally misguided- by 
his family, church and school- rather 
than wicked. 

Auchincloss chose two narrators to 
tell this story. About half of the 
chapters appear in the third person, 
yet this narrator tends to lapse into 
confusing Socratic dialogues that may 
or may not be projections of Chip's 
thoughts. For example, Chip's super-
ficial charm, his "blue eyes and golden 
hair," are described as a "mask." 
And had the mask been torn away, the 
plaudits might have been silenced, to be
