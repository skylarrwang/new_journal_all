Diagnosing the 
Arms Race 
-Peter Zusi 
"A 20-megaton nuclear warhead 
detonated over New Haven would 
destroy everything in a 
four-mile 
radius. Almost every survivor would be 
maimed, burned, or in shock. In time, 
they would develop new and virtually 
incurable ailments, such as st>vere 
radiation poisoning and reaction~ to 
contaminated food and water ... " 

So begins the New Haven "bomb 
run," one version of a horror story told 
around the country by members of 
Physicians for Social Responsibility 
(PSR). Founded in 1980 by former 
Yale Professor Robert Lifton and 20 
Yale Medical School (YMS) students, 
the New HavenÂ· chapter now boasts 
about 500 members. Both the New 
Haven and national 
PSR were 
established under the auspices of their 
parent organization, International 
Physicians 
for the Prevention of 
Nuclear War, whose founders received 
the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize. 

The national organization, with 
65,000 members, comprises not only 
medical doctors, but medical students, 
health workers, and some laymen as 
well. It aims to educate the public 
about the medical consequences of 
nuclear war and thus tries to create an 
active public lobby against nuclear pro-
liferation. "There's nothing like bring-
ing the abstraction of nuclear war down 
to something very physical, something 
people can relate to," said Laura 
Kuckes, YMS '87, a 
member of 
PSR-New Haven's steering commit-
tee. "The 'bomb run' was our initial, 
and most effective, tactic." 

Yet with PSR's expansion over the 
past five years, initial momentum and 
effectiveness of the traditional "bomb 
run" approach dissipated. 
The 
organization's leaders realized that in 
order to remain effective PSR would 
have to do more than to tell nuclear 
horror stories. The emphasis of its 
argument 
has shifted 
away 
from 
medical grounding. Since 1983 PSR 
has stressed other aspects such as 
childrens' fear of nuclear attack as well 
as political issues of nuclear testing and 
"Star Wars." 

Reflecting this shift in the national 
organization's strategy, 
PSR-New 
H aven sponsored two political forums 
in September and October of this year. 
The first, held at the Yale Law School, 
was a symposium on the Comprehen-
sive Test Ban Treaty. The October 
forum centered on Star Wars. In addi-
tion, the New Haven chapter, as part 
of the Coalition for a Meaningful Sum-
mit, publicly demands that President 
Reagan abandon his long-standing op-
position to nuclear freeze and reverse 
the arms race. 

Controversy has arisen over the 
politicization of the group. "Once doc-
tors step out of the medical-effects 
realm, do they lose their credibility? 
Do they have to take off their white 
coats and talk as citizens and not as 
doctors?" Kuckes asked. Controversy, 
though, has not halted the group's ac-
tivity. Today, with the more politically-
oriented approach and the awarding of 
the Nobel P rize, PSR is cautiously op-
timistic about its future. Doug Nelson, 
YMS '87, 
a 
steering-committee 
member, said, "The symptoms of 
the arms race have been ominous in the 
past few years. PSR's message is more 
prominent. It's too early to predict a 
full recovery for us, but now the signs 
are good."
