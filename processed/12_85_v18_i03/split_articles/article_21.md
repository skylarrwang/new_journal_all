**Title: General Dynamics Scandal**
**Page number(s): 38-39**

Kaufman, general council to Congress' 
Joint Economic Committee. Kaufman 
has been investigating the case for 
Wisconsin Senator William Proxmire, 
a Democrat with a reputation for bat-
tling government waste. 
Colonel Robert O'Brien, deputy 
assistant secretary of defense, 
disagrees with Kaufman. "Our in-
vestigators were on these things before 
Congress," O'Brien claims. "Congress 
just made them public." 
In this case, the fact that the Pen-
tagon was auditing GO's claims proves 
nothing about Pentagon knowledge of 
their fraudulence. Pentagon auditors 
challenge only a small percentage of 
expense claims, and even if a claim is 
challenged, studies show there is about 
a 50-50 chance it will eventually be 
paid. 
It took the investigations of Chair-
man of the House Energy and Com-
merce Committee John Dingle 
(D-Michigan) and Senator Proxmire 
to sting the Pentagon into action. Both 
politicians held Congressional hearings 
on the case and spoke out in the press, 
embarrassing the company and the 
Pentagon. 
Pressun..d mto action, the Pentagon 
fought against its critics and apparent-
ly penalized GO for its financial 
maneuvers. In March, Secretary of 
Defense Caspar Weinberger an-
nounced 
he 
was suspending $40 
million in payments to GD for 30 days. 
Weinberger also stated that all defense 
contractors would now have to swear 
to the legitimacy of expense claims 
under penalty of perjury. 
Then in May, Navy Secretary John 
c: 
Lehman announced that the Navy 
would withhold the awarding of any 
new contracts to two GD divisions, 
Electric Boat in Groton and the 
Pomona missile factory in Los 
Angeles. General Dynamics was rife 
with "a pervasive corporate attitude 
that we find inappropriate to the public 
trust," Lehman pronounced. 
Lehman established three conditions 
the company had to meet before he 
would consider lifting the suspension. 
According to Pentagon spokesman 
Lieutenant Max Allen, "General 
Dynamics had to establish and enforce 
a rigorous code of ethics for •all com-
pany officers and employees. Second, 
they had to resubmit and certify all 
outstanding overhead proposals, and, 
third, they had to negotiate those pro-
posals in good faith." 
For its part, once GD realized the 
.2 scandal would not go away, the com-
~ pany acted quickly to cut its losses. 
0 First came an announcement that GD 
~ was withdrawing $23 million in ex-
~ pense claims. Then David Lewis, GD 
l; chairman, announced that he would 
1 resign his position by the beginning of 
~ 1986. Few doubted that he was a 
casualty of the scandal. From all ap-
f pearances, General Dynamics was in 
8 trouble. 
Three months later, the Navy held 
another news conference. The crisis 
was over. It was lifting its ban on new 
contracts to GD. "There was no pat-
tern of corruption," announced Everett 
Pyatt, assistant secretary of the Navy 
for logistics and shipbuilding. The 
Navy proudly asserted that it had com-
bed 
through 97 million expense 
vouchers in 90 days. GD would have to 
lower its expense claims by $55 
million. 

The launching of the fast-attack submarine Providence, August 4, 1984

was lifted, the Navy awarded GD a

$616 million contract to begin con-
struction on the 12th Trident. As far as 
the Navy was concerned, everything 
was back to normal. 
Others following the case weren't 
convinced. Dingle and Proxmire in 
particular charged that the Navy had 
done nothing to punish the company 
seriously. 
By cracking down on 
General Dynamics, they argued, the 
Pentagon could have set an example 
for the entire defense industry. But no 
one was sure how General Dynamics 
had convinced the Navy to be so 
reasonable. 
General Dynamics certainly isn't 
telling. Company strategy throughout 
the investigations has been remarkably 
like that of their most famous product, 
the submarine: dive down silently 
underneath the turbulence and hope 
that when you come up again, the 
danger "has passed. 
Bjll 
Pedace, 
director of public affairs at Electric 
Boat, politely refused to be inter-
;,;iewed. Pedace would only say, "It's 
company policy not to give 
interviews." Or as another GD official 
put it, "We don't need another snake in 
the pit." 
Still, company critics have con-
tinued their digginr , and what they 
have discovert>d 
is alarming: 
the 
Navy's suspension had literally no ef-
fect on GD's economic well-being. 
"The only consequence the Navy's 
actions have had is the publicity 
associated with them," Proxmire says. 
"I don't think that would bother a firm 
like GD very much. They didn't lose 
any contracts, and they're right back in 
business in a big way." 
"General Dynamics laughed all the 
way to the bank," adds Pete Stockton, 
who investigated the company for 
Congressman Dingle. "They may have 
lost somewhere close to $100 million 
worth of overhead when we forced

them to retract their claims. But in the 
whole scheme of things at GD, that 
isn't that much. The suspension they 
had during that time, and the actions 
taken by Lehman- that's not going to 
hurt General Dynamics." 
Logically, it would be in the Navy's 
best interest to crack down hard on 
GD. Here was a golden opportunity to 
strike back against a greedy contractor 
caught with its hand in the till. A 
crackdown would send a warning 
signal to other contractors and a 
welcome signal to the American public 
that the Navy was fighting defense 
fraud. So why did the Navy let this one 
get away? 
The answer has a lot to do with the 
symbiotic relationships the Pentagon 
cultivates with all of its contractors, the 
you-scratch-my-back-1'11-scratch-yours 
friendships. "They use each other to in-
crease the budget and to get the 
weapons that they want," Stoc_kton 
says. "After a while, the relationship is . 
so tight that you feel, hey, maybe this 
is an aberration, we can rationalize 
that. But we're not really ·going to 
screw ·our friends to the wall and ac-
tually hurt them economically." 
"The Navy can send two messages," 
Senate Investigator Kaufman ex-
plains. "Navy officials could indicate 
to the company that they've been em-
barrassed, and they don't expect that to 
happen again. Or they could pass 
along that this is just a couple of 
isolated cases blown out of proportion, 
and they're not going to allow some 
wild congressional committees to drive 
a wedge between them and their most
