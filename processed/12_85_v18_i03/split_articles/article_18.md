"The only good thing 
that happened all day 
is that we got George 
Jackson. Killed him. 
Shot him in the head." 
turned over to the FBI. The letter con-
tains an exchange of messages between 
Carr and J ackson about the possibilty 
of J ackson's escape from San Quentin. 
But, as Bingham pointed out in his 
statement upon his return from hiding, 
"California's leading documents ex-
aminer later testified that the portion 
of the message supposedly written by 
Carr was not in his handwriting." 
Then there is also the testimony of a 
woman who met a young man named 
"Tony" in a singles bar in San Fran-
cisco the night after Jackson's escape 
attempt. The man mentioned that he 
was from the East Coast and had done 
something that "had ruined his life." 
And, in an illegal search of Jackson's 
files after his death, authorities found 
an erased note written on the back of 
an envelope which had once read, 
"Take the bullets out of the bag. Hurry 
and give me the piece in the bag. Keep 
the bullets." No evidence exists con-
necting Bingham to this message. I t 
was found in J ackson's cell, not on his 
body, meaning that, if the note did 
have any link to Bingham's visit, 
J ackson had taken the time after he 
began his escape attempt to hide it 
in his cell. Moreover, if it were ad-
dressed to Bingham, why did it say 
"keep the bullets" if he supposedly 
smuggled two clips of bullets in to 
Jackson along with the gun and wig? 


The official account of the escape at-
tempt finally emerged after a week of 
false starts and conflicting stories. 
Even the simple detail of the type of 
gun George Jackson was said to have 
used changed three times during that 
week, ranging from a "tiny gun with 
the grips removed" to the eight-inch 
long, nine-millimeter Astra automatic 
described in the final report. The 
Astra's serial number had not been 
completely filed off, 
conveniently 
allowing authorities to trace the gun to 
the Black Panthers. Six days before the 
attempt, however, the police had ar-
rested a Panther and confiscated an 
Astra, suggesting that the 
police 
themselves may have previously had 
the gun supposedly found on Jackson's 
body. 
Was it the same gun? If so, as a con-
fiscated weapon it could only have 
reached Jackson from 
within 
the 
prison, most likely through a guard, 
not from the outside. H ow could a 
visitor like Bingham smuggle such a 
weapon into San Quentin without 
detection? The state's own witnesses


The question of Bingham's guilt rests on more than the physical poa1ibilities of 1muggling a weapon into San Quentin. 

have said in the pre-trial hearings that 
Bingham and his folder 
passed 
smoothly through the metal detector 
and that the tape recorder which sup-
posedly contained the gun and clips 
were routinely inspected. Moreover, 
could a gun the size of a eight-inch 
Astra plus two clips be concealed in-
conspicuously inside of a 
tape 
recorder? Again in the pre-trial hear-
ings, the guard who had been on duty 
at the visitors' desk, said that, yes, the 
tape recorder he had inspected was 
large enough to hold a gun that size, 
but added, "I'm not saying there was a 
gun." 


Allowing that Bingham's tape 
recorder contained a gun, the question 
remains how Jackson, once he had 
it, managed to conceal the weapon 
during the escorted 50-yard walk from 
his visiting room back to the Adjust-
ment Center, where it is said to have 
been discovered. The prosecution 
asserts that Jackson hid the large gun 
and bullets under a flimsy afro wig not 
found by guards until August 24, three 
days after a thorough search of the Ad-
justment Center. 


The question of Bingham's guilt 
rests on more than the physical 
possibilities of smuggling a weapon in-
to San Quentin. Although accused of 
concealing the gun and bullets inside a 
tape recorder, he did not bring a tape 
recorder with him. According to state's 
witnesses, Bingham and his folder had 
already been cleared when the guard 
on duty asked him if he was taking 
a tape recorder. After Bingham replied 
that he had not brought one, a woman 
awaiting permission to visit jackson of-
fered 
him 
hers, 
which 
he 
took. 
Therefore, the tape recorder and case 
may have been brought into the 
prison, not by Bingham, but by 
another visitor, Vanita Anderson, a 
23-year-old woman with close ties to 
the Panthers. In the upcoming trial the 
prosecution may name Anderson as a 
co-conspirator with Bingham and 
Jackson, but she has not been charged 
with anything. In fact, in the interven-
ing 14 years, state investigators have 
never made a serious effort to question 
her, let alone arrest her. T he only ex-
planation for these actions is either that 
authorities knew Anderson was not 
guilty (but how, then, could Bingham 
be guilty?) and consequently did not 
interrogate her, or that Anderson 
herself had been working with the 
authorities as an infiltrator into the 
Black Panthers. 


Could the flaws and inaccuracies in the 
prosecution's case have resulted from a 
hurried attempt to cover up more than 
a foiled prison break-out? With the 
prison movement at its peak and 
Jackson a celebrity, the entire Califor-
nia State prison system would have 
been on trial. Jackson's best hope for 
freedom lay with the legal system, not 
with a suicidal attempt at escape. 
"Whenever anybody ends up dead, 
you look at the situation and say, 'Well 
who was most interested in his being 
killed?"' said Kathleen Cleaver, one-
time Black Panther and former wife of 
Panther leader, Eldridge Cleaver, who 
was an inmate in the Adjustment 
Center during the sixties. "Inside San 
Quentin, there are any number of peo-
ple, in particular guards, who could 
have had it in for him U ackson] for any 
length of time. 
"It is a very violent environment in 
San Quentin, and the prison 
authorities would provoke inc~dents in
