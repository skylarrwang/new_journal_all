â€¢sure, I think a lot of the professors 
are very liberal." 

This didn't surprise Csorba; in fact 
he said, "Yeah, because I have a list of 
over 1,000 radical, commie professors 
I've compiled over the last three years, 
and Yale seems to be one of the biggies. 
In fact, I can think of one off the top of 
my head." 

"'Oh, really?" I deadpanned. "Who's 
that?" 

He named Frederic Jameson, who I 
knew only as the author of Sartre: The 
Origins of a Style. I told Csorba I didn't 
know him, but I'd look into it. I promised to give him my campus phone 
number as soon as I knew it. 

I immediately called Yale to try and 
get a reaction from Jameson. But 
Jameson left Yale in 1983 to go to the 
University of California at Santa Cruz. 
publicly that AlA was giving students 
the names of professors to monitor, in 
effect creating its own reports of bias, 
would have compromised whatever 
legitimacy the group could hope to 
gain. It was then that I decided to go to 
Washington for a closer look.

On October 26, I visited AlA-after 
cutting my hair and donning a suit and 
tie. Accuracy in Academia occupies just 
one room in AIM's 12th floor K Street 
suite. (AIM also shares the suite with 
The Washington Inquirer, a D.C. weekly 
ultra-conservative newspaper. As far as 
I know, AIM has never checked the 
paper for "balance.") Csorba and I were 
alone in the office on a Saturday. With 
salmon Polo shirt and topsiders, Csorba 
looked out of place sitting behind the office desk. Scully, over six feet tall and 
athletically built, came in later. The atmosphere was casual, even playful; I 
sipped a Coke, and when Scully needed 
keys, Csorba tossed them across the office. 

On Csorba's wall hangs a framed 
calligraphic lament over the fall of 
Hungary in 1956. There are also personal endorsements from Senator Pete 
Wilson (R-California) and President 
Reagan. A large map of the United 
States dominates the wall across from 
his desk. Black-headed pins on the map 
mark each campus where AlA has a 
contact. Csorba smiled proudly as he 
showed me the pin marking Yale. 

Despite his cartographic practice, 
Csorba was 
surprised when 
I 
told him later that New Haven is north 
of New York, and he could not 
remember where Brown University was. 

Csorba gave me a full tour of the 
suite, handing me numerous AIM 
newsletters, articles on AlA, and copies 
of Freedom 
Fighter, 
a 
pro-contra 
newspaper put out by something called 
the Coalition for Democracy in Central 
America. Accuracy in Academia had 
taken out a quarter-page ad on page 
five, describing itself as "a nonprofit, 
non-partisan organization." We talked 
about the Reader case, about the 
various reactions to AlA, and about 
why I wanted to keep my activity secret, 
at least for the time being. 

In private, the directors of AlA do 
not talk about revolutionaries on the 
campus. Instead, they downplay the 
competence of their targets. "Really, 
these guys are a bunch of dumbbells; 
they're not that smart," Csorba told me 
earnestly. Scully was disgusted that 
"30 years after [William F. Buckley's] 
God and Man 
at 
Yale 
there 
are 
still the same hacks running around.'" 

He doesn't believe that there are many 
"thorough" Marxists teaching, "just a 
bunch of old fools who bore everybody 
with their own theories and only assign 
books written by people just like them." 

Csorba and Scully also talk about 
professors' "paranoid" reactions to AlA, 
though Csorba, too, may be a bit 
paranoid: he told me he tapes "[all this]
