with me in infiltrating the group; none 
would, citing the "harassment" and "in-
timidation" of Reader as one deterrent. 
("I'd like to, but I just don't have the 
time to deal with these twerps," said 
one professor). I also learned that 
untenured junior faculty members are 
particularly wary of AlA and that 
some graduate students- the most 
vulnerable scholars- have begun to 
suspect students in their sections as 
AlA representatives. Such suspicion 
affirms that AlA is harming the ex-
change of ideas essential to classroom 
learning. "I think we are having a chill-
ing effect," Csorba boasted to me. "I 
think we deter professors from saying 
what they used to say." 


AlA will probably not put any in-
dividual's job at risk. The only real 
threat they 
pose 
is to 
academic 
freedom. The professorial right to 
teach what one believes, to say what 
one chooses in a scholarly way, is hard-
earned. The idea that a student is in 
the classroom not to learn through in-
terpretation and debate, but to spy, 
may inhibit a professor from inter-
preting material with complete in-
tellectual honesty. The fear of being 
wrongly labelled a Castro supporter on 
the pages of The New York Times should 
not be part of a professor's job. Once 
the accusation is made, substantiated 
or not, the professor's reputation is 
already tarnished. He or she has no 
way to check the motives or respon-
sibility of this secret group. AlA wants 
professors to be accountable to the 
public; to whom will Accuracy in 
Academia be accountable?
