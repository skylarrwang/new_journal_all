Depths of Deception

Perhaps the only 
problem with the 
Trident is that only 
one company in the 
United States has the 
facilities to build it: 
G eneral D ynamics. 
The Trid ent Nevada, 
l a u nch e d September H, 1985 
" We see a new day dawning." 
On September 23, 1985, United States 
Senator Chris Dodd and Congressman 
Sam Gejdenson, both Connecticut 
Democrats, led a special, one-time-
only tour through the highly-classified 
Electric Boat shipyard in Groton, Con-
necticut. Among the visitors were 
Sc:nator 
Sam Nunn (0-Georgia), 
mmority leader of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee, Senator James 
Exxon (D-Nebraska), and Senator Jeff 
Bingaman (0-New Mexico). 
Dodd and Gejdenson had brought 
them to see the gigantic shipyard and 
its imposing creation, the Trident 
nuclear submarine. The senators had 
already heard a lot about the yard, not 
much of it good. The Connecticut 
politicians wanted their guests to like 
what they saw. After months of scandal 
and embarrassing political investiga-
tions, Electric Boat (EB) could use 
some good P R . 

The visitors were impressed. "There 
is no more important defense construc-
tion in the whole free world," Exxon 
said at a press conference. The politi-
cians posed for pictures. "We believe 
we see a new day dawning," said a 
beaming Gejdenson. 

The showcase of the tour was clearly 
the Trident, EB's most famous pro-
duct. At 560 feet, the submarine is 
almost as long as two football fields end 
to end. It can carry up to 24 nuclear 
sea-launched cruise missiles. The sub's 
four torpedo tubes fire the Mark 48 
torpedo with unerring accuracy. With 
a crew of 154, the Trident can cruise 
the world's oceans for over three 
months without surfacing. Military ex-
perts consider it the most important 
element in this country's air-land-sea 
military triad. 

Perhaps the only problem with the 
Trident is that just one company in the 
United States has the facilities to 
build it: General Dynamics (GO), the 
owner of the Electric Boat shipyard. 
GO was the third largest defense con-
tractor in 1984, with six billion dollars 
in revenue'<,'tnd is the only contractor 
supplying major weapons to all three 
branches of the Armed Services: M 1 
tanks for the Army, F-16 jets for the 
Air Force and, of course, the Tridents. 
The Navy has purchased 11 Tridents 
from GO at about $1.7 billion each, 
making the submarine the nation's 
most expensive weapon. 

But for the past year, General 
Dynamics has 
been 
beseiged 
by 
troubling 
revelations 
about ex-
pense fraud, illegal gratuities, stock 
manipulation, and more. If military 
reformers had needed evidence of the 
power and influence of defense con-
tractors, the General Dynamics case 
gave it to them. If the Pentagon had 
needed proof of defense fraud, that was 
there too. And if members of Congress 
had needed to be reminded of the 
"revolving door' from government to 
big business, they didn't have to look 
far into General Dynamics. 

Yet after all had been said and done, 
General Dynamics got away with it. A 
year of government uproar over 
"waste, fraud and abuse," and GO's 
earnings are increasing, its stock is 
strong, and in August the company 
was awarded a 
con.tract to build 
another Trident. 

Everyone has heard stories of 
military rip-offs-$500 hammers, $700 
coffeepots- the list could go on almost 
indefinitely. But such stories only hint 
at the greater flaws in defense spend-
ing; long after they have faded from 
headlines, deeper, more fundamental 
problems remain. Why is it that the 
scandals come and go but the roots of 
the corruption linger on? The General 
Dynamics scandal provides many of 
the answers. 

GD is nearly a century old, and an ex-
pose of the company could probably 
begin before the First World War. But 
perhaps the easiest place to start is with 
an aristocratic Greek millionaire 
named P. Takis Veliotis and a dog 
named Fursten. 

Aggressive, arrogant Takis Veliotis 
managed the Electric Boat shipyard 
from 1976-1981. Veliotis was widely 
credited with bringing an overdue, 
overbudget submarine-building pro-
gram back on course. After he became 
an 
executive 
vice-president, 
word 
among company insiders placed 
Veliotis as heir apparent to GD Chair-
man David Lewis. 

But in 1983, Veliotis suddenly 
resigned from GD and returned to his 
homeland of Greece, saying only that 
he had to tend a family estate rumored 
to be worth hundreds of millions of 
dollars. Shortly after his return, the 
Justice Department indicted Veliotis, 
claiming that he had accepted $1.3 
million in kickbacks from an Electric 
Boat subcontractor. 

In Greece, American law has no 
power over Veliotis. Nonetheless, he 
still has millions in assets tied up in this 
country and is unable to leave Greece 
for fear of arrest. Perhaps that explains 
why in January 1984, Veloitis in-
formed Tile Washington Post that he 
wanted to make a deal with the Justice 
Department: in exchange for immuni-
ty, he would give them tapes and 
documents proving fraud at General 
Dynamics. Despite its reluctance to 
listen to a fugitive, the Department 
agreed to hear Veliotis out, choosing to 
decide afterwards about his immunity. 

A few months later, the trut~ came out 
about Fursten the dog. 

Fursten belonged to a GD vice-
president fond enough of his pet to 
bring it on business trips. During one 
conference at Kiawah Island resort in 
.South Carolina, Fursten's owner had 
to board the dog at a kennel, the Silver 
Maple Farm. Kennel rent was $155, 
apparently more than 
the 
vice-
!" president wanted to pay. So he claimed 
8 Fursten as a business expense and put 
the bill on the Navy's tab. But when 
Veliotis started talking, 
government found out about Fursten. 
Fursten's bill, it turned out, was only 
one of thousands of illegitimate ex-
penses GD (and Electric Boat in par-
ticular) had charged to the govern-
ment. Among some of the most 
egregious items: $1'8,650 for country 
club memberships; $15,705 for golf 
shirts and caps; $251,000 for public 
relations dinners; $300,301 for com-
pany promotions, 
and amazingly 
enough, $15,000 for the Grace Com-
mission on Waste and Fraud in 
Government. The grand total was 
about $250 million. 

"If it weren't for Veliotis and the 
subsequent publicity, it's hard to im-
agine that any of that money would 
have been disallowed," says Richard
