which prisoners, in particular black 
prisoners 
who 
they considered 
troublemakers, ended up dead. That's 
one of the methods of prison control 
and 
intimidation used, 
so 
why 
wouldn't it be used in the case of 
George Jackson?" 

In fact, Warden Jim Park of San 
Quentin was quoted on August 21 as 
saying, "The only good thing that hap-
pened all day is that we got George 
J ackson. Killed him. Shot him in the 
head." Cleaver, now a second-year stu-
dent at Yale Law School, believes that 
J ackson, as a well-known bla~k revolu-
tionary, frightened authorities with the 
attention he drew to prison conditions. 
"The fact that he ends up dead in San 
Quentin two days before he was 
scheduled to go to trial, a public trial 
on a case from which he probably 
would have been acquitted- it's clear-
ly not George Jackson who wanted to 
die that day," Cleaver said. 

Cleaver's knowledge of San Quentin 
and the 
possibility of smuggling 
weapons into the prison contradicts the 
state's assertion that Jackson could 
have gotten the gun only through 
Bingham. She remembers that when 
her husband was in San Quentin, the 
most unlikely and risky way to get a 
gun was from a visitor. Instead, "cor-
ruptible guards" were the best sources 
of contraband. 

If the gun did come from the inside, 
if officials or guards did conspire to kill 
Jackson for fear of his activism, then 
Bingham may have been enveloped 
unknowingly by a cover-up. He was, 
as a California radical attorney, an 
easy and advantageous target. "Why 
does an innocent man flee?" Bingham 
asked the group at the New York 
reception. 

"Those of you 
remember the sixties know that it was a 
different time than now, a time when 
government agencies persecuted 
groups and individuals who were 
working for change. 

"The California D epartment of Cor-
rections was concerned about the role 
of lawyers in prison reform. The Uhler 
Commission set up by Ed 'Meese 
reported that lawyers were fomenting 
rebellion. The FBI outrageously 
harassed the National Lawyers Guild. 
Attorneys were the outside agitators. 
We were the catalysts for getting the 
word out." Bingham believes that he 
became the convenient scapegoat for a 
state government determined to dis-
credit activist lawyers. During an in-
terview on August 21, Warden Park 
had said, "You can. lay some of the 
blame for these six deaths at the 
doorstep of some of these radical at-
torneys who come in here and en-
courage the men [prisoners] to do this 
sort of thing." 

After discovering that "the entire 
focus of all news reports was on me," 
Bingham decided to lay low. Then, 
when it was reported that the DA had 
"conclusive evidence" against him, 
he decided to flee. "Had I stayed," 
Bingham said, "there would have been 
no fair trial, no bail, and I wouldn't 
have survived in the California jails 
with those guards. I was accused of 
killing three of their colleagues." 

Bingham provides few details about 
the 13 years he spent in hiding, saying 
only that he learned to work in con-
struction, continued his political ac-
tivism,and lived with a woman for five 
years whom he has since married. He has 
returned because he believe~ , today he 
can receive a just trial. "Things are dif-
ferent now," he explained. "The at-
titude people have toward state and na-
tional governments 
has 
changed. 
Watergate created a climate in which 
people accepted the idea that govern-
ment isn't always ethical and that at 
times, especially in the sixties and early 
seventies, it engaged in illegal and im-
moral practices in trying to discredit 
those who have been actively working 
for change." Although confident he will 
be acquitted, he does not and cannot 
disregard the state's efforts to convict 
him. 

After the reception was over and most 
people had gone, Wayne Batcheler 
led Bingham and his father out onto 
the terrace. From 54 stories high, the 
view of Manhattan on the clear, 
unusually warm November night was 
startling. Bingham pointed to the 
Chrysler building. "Which one is 
that?" he asked. Batcheler !'lnswered 
and then named some of the other im-
pressive towers nearby. Like a visitor 
seeing the skyline for the first time, or 
perhaps like someone who had been 
away for so long he had forgotten its 
beauty, Bingham continued for a mo-
ment to gaze out at the city. In the next 
few days he would give more recep-
tions in New York, then on to Boston, 
and finally back to California where he 
would continue raising money until 
J anuary 7, when his trial begins. The 
jury will have to decide if Bingham is 
guilty of five murders. Fourteen years 
have elapsed since that day in San 
Quentin, and it will be up to Bingham 
and his lawyers to place the events of 
August 21, 1971 into the context of an 
era that, for some, has grown faded in 
memory. Whatever the outcome of the 
trial, the mystery surrounding George 
J ackson's death will probably not be 
resolved. "People want to know, if I 
didn't do it, then who did?" Bingham 
said. "But it's not like Perry Mason. 
The tragedy of this case is that what 
really happened that day may never be 
known."
