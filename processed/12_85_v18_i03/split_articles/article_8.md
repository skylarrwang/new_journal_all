The Other Side of Brunch 
We've all done it, we all do it, and we'll 
all do it again. Come on, don't look so 
innocent, you know what I'm talking 
about. Remember today at lunch when 
in your tension and quest for expedi-
ency, you dribbled French dressing all 
over the salad bar? You ignored it, 
looking up at the witnesses contemp-
tuously, continuing to 
pile 
more 
cucumbers on your plate. As the din-
ing hall worker wiped up the mess, you 
nonchalantly moved away from the 
area, 
feeling 
both 
defensive 
and 
somewhat guilty. But you quickly 
forgot the incident. You sat down at 
your favorite table with a friend. Your 
contented thoughts moved like circles 
of smoke, until they lifted and disap-
peared 
into 
the rafters-leaving 
behind all 
responsibility 
for 
the 
messiness of spilled salad dressing, 
sticky floors, and dirty dishes. 

I entered a dining hall the other day, 
feeling grumpy and impatient, and 
flashed my cards at the woman behind 
the desk, not noticing or caring who 
she was. "Quiche. Mixed vegetables," I 
said to the servers, who remain faceless 
in my memory. I sat down, played 
with the salt, and created a series of 
hills on the table. Then I bussed my 
tray, oblivious to the signs requesting I 
throw away my napkins and styrofoam 
cups. Most of us who eat in dining 
halls forget the work involved in 
preparing our meals and cleaning our 
mess. We also forget the workers 
themselves. 

Dining halls may be the most unusual 
work-place at Yale. On the one hand, 
it is one of the only contexts where

between me and other 
students." 
students can be felt and seen. Students 
are literally put into the position of 
having to serve their peers. Moreover, 
because student dining hall workers 
receive the highest wage on campus, 
students on aid tend to occupy most 
dining hall jobs. 

Because of the 
economic and social differences which 
emerge once students put on their blue 
uniforms, workers often resent those 
whom they have to serve. "Sometimes 
when I'm working on the serving-line, 
I feel as though there's a wall between 
me and other students," said Betina 
Elias, PC '87. "There's sort of a 
worker-customer relationship. My 
contact with them stays in my mind, 
but for them I'm just the girl serving 
the green beans." 

At the same time, however, student 
workers find their relation to other 
workers hard to define. "We really 
don't have much in common with 
regular workers." Elias explained. 
"Our jobs are such a small part of our 
lives, while for them it's their whole 
day." The regular-workers work side 
by side with students who will earn a 
Yale d iploma at the end of four years. 
Meanwhile, some full-time employees 
remain stuck in the same position for 
decades. With this double set of con-
flicts, this student job differs from any 
other. 

From the outside, working in the 
dining hall seems appealing. Most 
workers would agree, and certainly a 
camaraderie develops among employ-
ees. However, the job also contains 
daily reminders of Y.ale's less-than-
democratic social structure. I once 
worked a brunch "floor shift," rumored 
to be the perfect job for those who are 
willing to interrupt their gossip ses-
sions with friends to do a oit of work. 
For about an hour, everything went as 
predicted. I sat in a carefully chosen 
corner talking to a friend, observing 
the eaters, casually watching the coffee 
level and the napkin supply, two of my 
top priorities. I knew that people were 
aware that I was a worker but that my 
presence didn't really register. I was in-
visible to most students. 

But then, hal.fway through the meal, 
the craziness began. As soon as I had 
brought out more boxes of Sptcial-K, 
someone alerted me to the fact that he 
could find no more Lift. Then the hut-
ter and the English muffins ran out 
simultaneously. "They can't expect us 
to eat this margarine, can they?" one 
student asked, horrified. After stand-
ing up for the next two hours and then 
sweeping and mopping the floor, I 
learned that the rumors concerning the 
ease .of the "floor shift" were mere fic-
tion. 

Students commonly believe dining 
hall employees are responsible for
