In the small, comfortable living room 
of an Upper East Side apartment, 
Stephen Bingham, '64, sat on the edge 
of an overstuffed chair, phone in one 
hand and pen in the other, leaning 
over an open briefcase and some loose 
papers spread out on the floor. A hand-
some man, about six feet tall, Bingham 
has deep-set eyes and full, wavy hair 
that is just a bit longer than conven-
tional for his generation. He is 43 now, 
and time has softened the lines of his 
face and streaked his hair with gray. 
After hanging up the phone he said, "I 
only flew in from California yesterday, 
so it's still just seven a.m. my time." He 
paused, 
shuffling through some 
papers, and then began to speak. "You 
know there are some things I can't talk 
about, that my lawyers don't want me 
to talk about now. I'd like to say it alJ, 
but I can't until the trial. There really 
isn't much I can add to what I said last 
night." 

The night before, in a plush mid-
town apartment, Bingham gave one of 
his "receptions," a gathering of his 
friends, friends of the tamily and 
others who came to hear his story and 
to consider his request for donations to 
his defense. T he elegant room on the 
54th floor gradually filled to 30 people. 
Bingham himself was there early, busy 
shaking hands and talking with people 
he either didn't know or hadn't seen in 
years: old friends of his from Milton 
Academy and Yale, all verging on mid-
dle age, and others, a full generation 
older, friends of Bingham's father, 
Alfred, '27. Wayne Batcheler, '64, 
who arranged Bingham's schedule for 
this East Coast trip, signaled the start of 
the talk. 

As Batcheler made a brief introduc-
tion, Bingham stood against a wall 
studying notes through reading glasses 
that seemed to age him another 10 
years. Glasses ofT, he came forward 
slowly, looking slightly uncomfortable 
in jacket and tie. He cleared his throat 
and lifted his eyes to the small seated 
crowd. "First I'd like to thank all of you 
"Had I stayed there 
would have been no 
fair trial, no bail, and 
I wouldn't have 
survived in the 
Califomia jails with 
those guards. I was 
acc~ed of killing 
three of their 
colleagues."
