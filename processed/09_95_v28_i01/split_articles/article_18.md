choice but to walk past it fi~e times a day. You see a sign in the 
clinic window and you read it. Seeing information makes students 
curious, makes them ask questions, and then they learn the facts," 
she says. 


The students also emphasize the importance of services 
rendered at the clinics that they may not find elsewhere. For 
Bethany, condom distribution is the most important function of 
her SBHC. "Lots of girls I've talked to are embarrassed to buy 
condoms at the store. What if they need a price check on them 
while you're at the register? That's embarrassing," Bethany says. 
"Condoms are expensive. If they don't have the money, some kids 
will do what they have to do, if you know what I mean." To 
anyone who does not catch Bethany's meaning, the statistics prove 
her point: with or without condoms, kids are having sex. In 
addition to providing condoms and health education, the clinics 
appear to fulfill the role of a support network envisioned by Janet 
Spinner, chair of the Adolescent Committee of the Mayor's 
AIDS/HIV Task Force. Bethany attests to this; she learned the 
value of the SBHC's support system when she lost her own father 
to AIDS. "To come to school and have them say they're available 
to you is a big help," Bethany says. "Drop-outs are missing out on 
a good opportunity."

Despite a positive attitude towards the SBHCs, the 
program's supporters acknowledge its failures along with 
its successes. "We still need to demonstrate to children 
that they have other options in life than to become sexually 
active," McCann-Vissepo says. Spinner believes the SBHCs and 
outreach programs are far from the best format for delivering 
information. But she also sees the undisputed facts. "We need to 
makes condoms available. I would prefer that parents do it and 
have the discussion with their children. The clinics are the second 
or third best option," she says. For now, however, they may be the 
best option for New Haven teenagers who are not receiving 
information in their homes. Spinner tells a joke about the lack of 
communication between parents and kids regarding sex. "What 
~re the two kinds of people who never have sex?" she asks wryly, 
answering her own question with more than a hint of irony. "Our 
parents and our kids." Spinner is so familiar with the untruth in 
this statement that she barely sees the humor anymore. If the 
parents and schools are not doing enough to educate kids on the 
streets and change their behavior, Spinner knows that she has to 
try. "I'd rather they abstain, but if they have gonorrhea twice, I 
want to save their lives," she says. "I think their lives are worth 
. "


Spinner recalls a time when condoms were nowhere to be 
found in clinics and sex education did not exist in schools. She 
has diagnosed countless HIV-positive teens and seen many 
pregnancies. In the face of this, Spinner created the Task Force to 
encourage the incorporation of more comprehensive SBHC's and 
condom distribution into all New Haven schools. 

While condom distribution draws the most attention, 
administrators and health professionals believe the SBHCs more 
important role is to provide support for kids who can't find it 
outside of school. "The program is really the clinic, and the red 
herring is the condoms," says Spinner. Her voice takes on a tone 
of urgency and a hint of sadness as she discusses the plight of 
many New Haven teenagers. "[Sexually active] kids need someone 
to say, 'Hi, are you in there? I love you. I care about you.' And 
you'll knock on the kid's door 112 times before they let you in.
