Weathering changes in tastes and

continues to showcase world-class 
mus1c1ans. 


the remotest of time slots. In his whole life, Ruff pointed out, 
Duke Ellington only made one television appearance. "The jazz 
audience, as such, no longer exists," he said. 

There is plenty of evidence to back up this view. The New 
Haven Jazz Festival on the Green has been reduced in scale from 
nearly a dozen concerts per summer to three or four. Yale Band 
Director Tom Duffy tells tragic stories of failed University jazz 
concerts. The Annual Yale Jazz Fest, launched in the mid-eighties, 
didn't survive past its second year, when musicians played to those 
few undaunted by snowstorms. A 1985 Miles Davis concert only 
half-filled Woolsey Hall, and members of the audience began 
trickling out by the middle of.the show. "You couldn't give the 
tickets away," Duffy recalled. Branford Marsalis fared no better 
some years later. And even today, Duffy reports, if he dares to play 
anything more progressive than big band jazz (for which there still 
exists a loyal audience among sixty-something suburbanites), he is 
faced with an audience of 50 to 100 people in the 800-seat 
Sprague Hall. On such nights, said Duffy, "you can hear every 
single stroke of the clapping." 

For bar and club proprietors like Cafe Nine owner Mike 
Reichban, the reality is not only that jazz lures smaller crowds, but 
that those who come do not drink and spend as much as the young 
crowds lured with rock bands and DJs. "Uazz fans] are the kind of 
people who like to savor that single malt scotch," Reichbart said. 
"For them, a drink is just a small embellishment to the scene." 

Nevertheless, the fact remains that on any given night in this 
city there is a place where one can hear the soulful wail of 
saxophones, the piercing blasts of a trumpet, the maniac rumbling 
of drums, or the curious twangs and hums of a bass. In the 
summer, when the heat seems to impair bodjly functions in a 
permanent way, when breathing becomes less a mechanism for the 
support of life than a process of sucking heat here and spitting it 
there, when people feel that heat may overwhelm personal 
expression- become the only expression-at those annihilating 
hours, there is jazz to awaken the mind.

C
afe Nine is like nothing so much as a buzzing spirit in the 
midst of a body laid waste by inactivity. You can walk there 
any night of the week, down either Chapel or Crown 
Street, without seeing a soul between the back of the Taft 
Apartments and the crowded stoop of Cafe Nine itself. You'll pass 
the Chapel Square Mall where it sleeps-filled, one supposes, with 
a great swirling vortex of city planning nightmares. From here, on 
the Crown Street side, you'll walk along a row of some of the 
oldest buildings left downtown, every single one of them empty. 
On the Chapel Street side you'll pass the American Discount Store 
with its permanent "Giant Clearance Sale" sign hanging in the 
window. A little further down, beyond Nu Haven Books, the Las 
Vegas Jewelers storefront stands criss-crossed with strings of 
colored Christmas lights, blinking stale holiday cheer into the 
empty lot across the street. Signs in the window invite passersby to 
browse an intoxicating selection of gold teeth, beepers, and silver 
name plates. 

One cannot walk to Cafe Nine repeatedly at night without 
learning one thing: downtown New Haven is not particularly 
dangerous after dark, just deserted and a little bit eerie. But if you 
ask anyone inside Cafe Nine why it is the only bar of its kind they 
will tell you, almost every time: "People in New Haven are afraid 
to come out." No one is particularly interested in the question. ,, 
Conversation on the topic was exhausted long ago. William Sherr, 
the owner of a recording studio rwo doors down from Cafe Nine,

takes the explanation one plodding step 
further for my benefit. "When people leave 
cities," he says, "cities die." 

As chairman of the Ninth Square 
Development Association, Sherr has dealt 
with the frustration of trying to support 
nightlife and othet commercial ventures 
without a flourishing residential area. It's 
tough, he says, to keep a bar filled when 
the nearest vibrant neighborhood is further 
than most people want to walk. (With 
more stringent drinking-and-driving laws, 
driving to bars is increasingly uncommon.) 

The newly refurbished apartments within 
the Ninth Square, roughly the space 
between Cafe Nine and the Chapel Square 
Mall, are still relatively lifeless; the ground 
floor space reserved fOJ< merchants has yet 
to be filled. In large measure, the 
resurrection of downtown New Haven, if it 
is to be, will come about by repopulating 
this area. "The Ninth Square may be one 
of the last legitimate opportunities for 
people to belong to a diverse community," 
says Cafe Nine's Reichbart.

n a later visit to the bar, Riechbart 
has given me his treasured copy of 
an out-of-print book with the 
tide, The New Haven Sound: 1946-1976 
In the opening pages, author Paul Lepri 
brags that in the 1940s, New Haven 
8 
turned out more big band leaders than any 
other city in the U.S. He names such stars . 
as Artie Shaw, Les Elgart, and· Buddy 
Morrow, who all got their start in Elm 
City. I turn the pages eagerly, but after this 
promising start the book degenerares into a 
dry genealogy of obscure bands, 
cataloguing their formations 
and 
mutations with sentences that tease the 
imagination to distraction, such as the 
cryptic line: "The Corvettes changed their 
name to the Cadavers and added Nick 
Bagwasco on rhythm guitar." 

Reichbart, a small, peripatetic man 
who flutters around his bar like someone 
looking for his car keys, alights on the 
booth opposite me. The building which 
today is Cafe Nine has a long history of 
supporting various bars and taverns, he 
says, his words coming in torrents. 
In the 1870s, patrons of the bar then in 
this building used to get in fights with 
patrons of a temperance bar across the 
street. Reichbart first went into business 
here in the seventies, when he opened a 
"hippie, biker bar" called "Blue Bartz." 
Back then, when Budweiser cost $.50 a 
bottle, Reichbart's clientele generally called 
for an ounce of Schaefer's alongside an 
ounce of bar whiskey. Today, with three or 
four jazz performances a week, Cafe Nine 
is the city's premier jazz venue. 
"Life without music is a mistake," 
Reichbart suddenly blurts out, after a brief 
meditative silence. "Who said that? 
Nietzche? No. Yes." 
"Jazz is a safe music," he continues. 
"[You listen to jazz] if you are someone 
who doesn't think that the next 
neighborhood is some disgusting breed of 
people." 

The truth of this statement can be 
upheld with more powerful evidence than 
simple bar-brawling statistics. At the 
Ebony Lounge, a jazz and disco bar that 
sits on the town line between New Haven 
and Hamden, there is a sign in the window 
forbidding the entrance of people under 
the age of 25. Why? People who patronize 
the bar come mostly from a neighborhood 
in which lies a disproportionate number of 
older African-Americans who have retired 
and settled down to a quiet life. Ray 
Bright, one of the current owners of the 
bar, which has been in business 35 years 
under various managements, said what he 
doesn't need is "any of that hip-hop shit," 
music which draws young men with "their 
pants hanging down over their asses," men 
whom Bright fears may carry weapons. 
"Kids come in here and drive the older 
people away," he said. 

The Saturday afternoon jazz audience 
at the bar is anything but scary. As Martin 
Luther King gazes serenely from a portrait 
behind the stage and a galaxy of Christmas 
lights throws shadows on the old tin 
ceiling, the room fills with what seems to 
be one large family turning out for a 
picnic. Pinstripe oxfords and pressed white 
blouses abound. New Haven legend Wayne 
Boyd leads his jazz trio through a chilling 
rendition of "Round Midnight" at three in 
the afternoon. Boyd formed his first band 
in the city in 1966, at age ·16, and

eventually worked his way up to a position 
in the Jimmy McGriffith Quartet, a band 
that plays gigs throughout the world. At 
the Ebony Lounge, Boyd hefts his wireless 
guitar from one room to the next as he 
plays, greeting old acquaintances between 
riffs. 

I
've come down to Cafe Nine on a 
Monday night to hear Collectively 
Speaking, voted New Haven's favorite 
jazz band in Th~ Advocau's annual readers' 
music poll, but most of its members are on 
vacation. In its place I find an impromptu 
trio made up of New Haven Symphony 
bassist Jim Andrews, Collectively Speaking 
drummer Ken Aldrich, and a guitar player 
who regularly appears at Foxwoods Casino, 
Dave Dana. Dana is very fast. As a player, 
he seems almost obsessed with speed. One 
man at the bar is thrilled. He leans over to 
tell his wife in a voice just a little too loud, 
"that's as fast as they get." Aldrich is a 
drumming phenomenon. To watch him 
pull his wild array of sounds from four 
drums and four symbols is no less · 
bewildering and fantastic than to watch a 
magician pull rabbits from a hat. 

Between sets, Dana finds his way to my 
table. He is wearing a shirt like a Jackson 
Pollack painting (unbuttoned to show an 
abundance of deep black chest hair), a 
strange brand of blue jeans, and white high 
top sneakers with bright red laces. One is 
not surprised to learn his former place of 
residence, before returning to his home-
town New Haven in 1982, was Las Vegas. 
In the seventies, Dana left New Haven 
for Florida with nothing but his suitcase, 
his guitar, and 50 bucks. In Florida he 
lived on the streets for a time before he 
found a regular gig on an island off the 
coast. One thi~g led to another until 
Dana's band landed a gig at the Stardust 
Casino in Las Vegas. Dana drove across the 
country and spent several years in Vegas, 
playing various casinos and ultimately 
landing a job .as the house guitar player at 
the Las Vegas Hilton, where he had the 
opportunity to play with big name 
entertainers such as jazz singer Joe 
Williams, and pop singers Tina Turner, 
Diana Ross, and Stevie Wonder. When 
Dana left Vegas, it was to join Stevie 
Wonder's band. Dana has played under his 
own name for three years. "I've developed 
the ability to hold the stage," he says 
coolly. "I don't have to be behind a skirt 
any more." 

Aldrich squirms like a turtle on its back 
when separated from his drum sticks. He 
sits uncomfortably in the chair opposite 
me as he narrates his rise from a wedding 
gig drummer, who banged away in his 
basement at all hours for practice, to the 
drummer for the Tommy Dorsey Quartet 
as it toured the country. When pressed, 
Aldrich admits that he has been coached 
by drumming legend Louis Bellson, but for 
the most part he seems content to sum 
things up with the observation, ''I'm kind 
of childish, Dave is kind of Las Vegas, but 
oh well." He wants to return to his drums. 

t is difficult to say whether jazz is on 
the rise in New Haven or more or less 
running in place. The ever popular 
Rudy's on Elm Street began staging live 
jazz on Tuesday nights about a year ago 
and has seen that generally slow bar night 
transformed into one almost as busy as any 
other, particularly when Yale is in session. 
Still, saxophone player Wayne Escoffery, 
who runs the jazz sessions with as many of 
his musician friends who show up on a 
given night, isn't sure that people come for

love of the music so much as to drink and 
hang out. A sampling of the crowd backs 
him up, revealing that few either listen to 
jazz at home or go in search of it on their 
nights out. Rudy's proprietor Thomas 
Henniger characterized Tuesday nights as 
"our regular crowd. The only difference is 
the ten guys carrying instruments."

up with the music-can be found 
at Charlie B's .Steak House, where 
world class bass player Jeff Fuller (ES '67, 
MUS '69) and piano player local Bill 
Brown play on alternate weekends. On one 
Saturday night, Fuller leads his band 
through swing classics, like the song that 
invites you to "Get your kicks on Route 
66." The lights of the big brass chandeliers 
are dimmed way down, leaving the wine 
racks in shadow and rendering barely
