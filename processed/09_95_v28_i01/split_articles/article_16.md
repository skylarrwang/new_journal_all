**Oral History and the Holocaust**
**Author: Karm Jacobson**
**Page number(s): 22-23**

exploding from behind barbed wires, a 
stampede of people breaking loose, 
screams, shots" battle cries, explosions. It 
was no longer the deadly timelessness of 
Auschwin ... The woman fell silent and the 
tumults of the moment faded. She became 
subdued again and her voice resumed the 
uneventful, almost monotonous and 
lamenting tone." 

Laub showed the testimony a few 
months later at a conference with 
historians. The historians argued that it 
was factually known that not four but only 
one chimney had exploded. They 
emphasized the importance of accuracy so 
that revisionists could not use such 
testimony to discredit proof of the 
Holocaust. 

Laub disagreed, and the structure of 
the testimonies support his argument. Oral 
history should not be used like the written 
documentation by the Nazis themselves, 
which accurately catalogues the events. 
"The woman was testifying not to the 
chimneys blown up, but to something else 
more radical, more crucial: the reality of 
an unimaginable occurrence. One chimney 
blown up in Auschwitz was as incredible as 
four ... The woman testified to an event that 
broke the all-compelling frame of 
Auschwitz, where Jewish armed revolts just 
did not happen, and had no place. She 
testified to the breakage of a framework. 
That was historical truth." 

"The university is important," said 
Hartman. "We cannot expect oral history 
to be as precise as research since this is 
memory of 50 years now. This gathers 
information on daily hiding and 
activities., 

The archives of videotapes reveal 
humanity in detail. Instead of directing the 
tapings with preset agendas, 'interviewers 
allow survivors to guide the convc.rsation. 
At Yale, interviewers make exceptions 
occasionally to help illuminate less 
documented areas of Holocaust history. 
The academic setting of Yale's project 
encourages feedback from researchers who 
will eventually use these tapes. 

During the past 16 years, Yale has 
refined its model for interviewing. Now it 
hopes to pass on this knowledge to the 
young Spielberg group. Spielberg has 
donated $500,000 to the Fortunoff 
project, but has earmarked it for 
cataloguing purposes only, not taping. And 
while Spielberg reaps the benefits of Yale's 
years of experience, Fortunoff faces 
financial doom. Unless another major 
grant appears in the next year, Yale must 
discontinue taping testimonies. Yale's 
ground-breaking work has allowed 
Spielberg to jump in quickly without 
difficulty. These interviews are not filled 
with heroic acts and happy endings; the 
interviewers and the interviewing process 
must allow both the testifier and the 
viewer the forum to hear the stories. 

If you wa~ not tha~ it is difficult to 
tkscrib~ and say how it was ... ! don't know if 
th"~ is [a] word to dmrib~ th~ nightmar~ 
on~ go~s through ... how mm fonction untkr 
such a strm is on~ thing, and thm how you 
communicatt and txprm [to] som~body who 
n~v~r ltn~w that such a d~gru of brutality 
[is] txisting sums lilt~ a fantasy ... 

The viewer leans toward the screen, her 
body tense, responding to every word the 
witness utters. She looks to others sitting 
around her for similar responses, but they 
do not hear the testimony she hears in her 
earphones. She squirms, yet cannot turn 
off the tape, cannot stop the story midway 
through. She wonders, 'What would I have 
done, how would I have acted?' As 
Hartman wrote in "Learning from 
Survivors: the Yale Testimony Project," 
"Face to face with that world, it is our 
search for meaning which is disclosed, as if 
we had to be comforted for what they 
suffered." The viewer walks away from 
that interview. Yet, just as the testifier, she 
feels she must speak and must talk about 
the trauma she has just witnessed. These 
projects aim to compel her to speak, to 
fulfill the promise inscribed on the Dachau 
memorial, "Never Again.'"
