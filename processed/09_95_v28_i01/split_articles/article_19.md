I'm facing my roommate Steven on a city street in Beijing. As the locals pass on bicycles, we're engaged in a fight to the death. I grab Steven in a headlock and punch him until he flips over, a tangled mess of arms and legs. I pump my fist in the air as my friends whoop and shout in celebration. Suddenly, a vicious kick to the head sends me crashing to the floor. 
Miraculously restored, Steven stands over me, laughing a twisted sort of cackle. Exulting over this latest blow, he declares, "Oh man, that was sick!"

It's not that we don't like each other. And neither one of us is particularly violent. We're only like this when we're playing Street Fighter. Sega has transformed our otherwise peaceful common room into something out of Lord of the Flies.

Nearly everyone on our floor enjoys some level of addiction; at least it's comforting to know that we're not alone in our mania. Especially among males, Sega has become one of Yale's most popular pastimes, a video-game subculture complete with its own language. For the uninitiated, the above scene might seem a mystery. But Sega players are familiar with the violence of Street Fighter, Sega's most popular game.

Street Fighter's premise is simple: two characters, chosen from the game's twelve stock personalities, beat on each other until one knocks the other out. Each character has a signature move which only he or she can perform. For instance, Chun-Li, a slight Asian woman (and, incidentally, the only female character) specializes in the Chinny-Chi Ching, a devastating maneuver in which she turns upside down, and scissors her legs like helicopter rotor blades to elevate herself, repeatedly kicking her opponent's head. Aaron, the senior down the hall who's on his way to Yale Law School, claims to be the world's leading authority on Chun-Li, having spent months mastering the nuances of the Chinny-Chi Ching. At any hour of the day or night, Aaron can be found too close to the glowing screen with his dirty, size-13 sneakers twisted Indian style. At these moments, his unshaven face and gaping mouth take on a violent look of competitive intensity that stands in stark contrast to Chun-Li's balanced, delicate features. It always seems impossible to me that the herky-jerky motions of Aaron's hairy knuckles on the controller somehow correspond to the graceful poised flips and leaps of his counterpart. I don't think Aaron ever fully appreciates this irony, being too enraptured by the two-inch character existing somewhere between Cindy Crawford and Bruce Lee.

When I play Street Fighter, I usually choose Edmund Honda, a 400-pound Japanese sumo wrestler. This choice is considered something of a cop-out among my friends, due to the fact that Honda has an extremely powerful punch, and in order to win all I have to do is tense up all my muscles, contort my face, and press the punch button as fast as I can to unleash Honda's patented "Fists o' Fury." True Honda players win by defying gravity and flying headfirst at opponents like a human torpedo. I still have a long way to go before I reach that level of expertise.

Just as in sports, stories grow up around Sega, myths about feats and accomplishments. Tom, the junior living down the hall, read that if you reach the end of Street Fighter II without a single loss, all the defeated characters appear in hospital beds. The elusive "hospital beds" quickly became the Holy Grail of my floor, sending Tom on a crusade which remains, to this day, unfulfilled.

I was reminded of our Sega exploits on a recent humid August night at Shea Stadium where the Mets were facing the Los Angeles Dodgers. Most of the evening's 13,000 fans were unapologetically apathetic. Next to me, an overweight, balding man was dozing off with a plate of nachos in his lap, another victim of what the media calls "baseball's soporific pace." Sitting there in the sun, I realized that his dreams could be far more exciting than the lulling action on the field. I pictured him climbing over the barricades and sprinting at lightning speed to the mound to deliver the Chinny-Chi Ching to Dodger pitcher Hideo Nomo. I could see him taking it upon himself to get back at the players for being too skilled, too rich, too blessed with talent.

Perhaps the popularity of Sega's realistic games can blur the line between what's real and what's a video game. Who's to say what is
