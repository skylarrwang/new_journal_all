Beinecke's Best Kept Secret 
If Carl Van Vechten were alive today, he 
would have loved M & M's well-known 
slogan, "Melts in your mouth but not in your 
hand." Coming across the jingle in a 
magazine or on TV, he would have reveled in 
its myriad sexual meanings. He would have 
then cut it out in order to create a new page 
in one of his scrapbooks. After pasting the 
slogan onto a page of one of these albums, he 
would have continued sipping the pages of 
his GQ or Esquire, browsing until he found 
the perfect Versace or Calvin Klein 
advertisement to illustrate the particular 
gayness between the lines of the M & M's 
slogan. On his death bed, he would have 
bequeathed the scrapbook containing this 
home-grown erotica to the rare books division 
of a distinguished, private university's library 
system.


In fact, the real Carl Van Vechten made 
just such a donation when he died in 1964. 
Van Vechten's scrapbooks, pieced together in 
the 1950s, now reside in the Yale Collection 
of American Literature, housed in the 
Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. 
Famous for his photographic portraits of 
Harlem Renaissance writers, his subjects 
included the likes of Zora Neale Hurston and 
Langston Hughes. But in his scrapbooks he 
abandoned his more formal portraits to create 
collages grounded in his campy sense of 
humor. Van Vechten wanted to reveal 
something gay in popular culture, so he 
uprooted the sexualized imagery found in his 
scrapbooks from an extensive variety of 
sources: his own collection of pornography; 
pictures he took of nude men who modeled 
for him; photos of athletes and soldiers 
clipped from various periodicals; and, finally, 
sexually suggestive headlines like: "Steaks that 
melt in your mouth."


Journalism that focused on gender 
confusion fascinated Van Vechten. He cut out 
one article, for instance, about Christine 
Jorgensen, a man who became a woman. Max 
Lerner, the article's author, suggested that 
Jorgensen "changes his sex-and the planets 
stop whirling in their course to discuss his 
(her) case." He wanted us to see, first, that 
transgressing the sometimes rigid social 
constraints of gender and sexuality was 
possible in spite of what our bodies look like. 
He also revealed how popular and public 
culture contributed to what we are as sexual 
beings in private-and especially what it 
meant to be homosexual.


For example, Van Vechten placed in one 
album a 1955 newspaper story that reported how a 
British panel concluded that the "real 
safeguard against homosexual activity ... is 
public opinion." Van Vechten's inclusion of 
this article in one of his scrapbooks revealed 
an apparent paradox: Public opinion can be 
homophobic and oppressive, but it also helps 
to mark out a gay identity because it 
acknowledges that homosexuals exist. In other 
words, public opinion, while sometimes 
oppressive, may work as a safeguard for, 
rather than against, homosexual activity.


Moreover, for Van Vechten to piece together 
his campy collages from so many different 
and frequently public sources, was to assert 
not only his own identity as a gay man, but to 
suggest that there were others like him--even 
if many of them concealed their fantasies 
about men.


Although today we might consider the 
community he was documenting as almost 
too private, a culture too closeted to enjoy its 
desires, Van Vechten's inclusion of an article 
about military cadets at West Point playing 
the female roles in The Merry Wives of 
Windsor suggests that we might be wrong. 
While it would be extravagant to claim that 
being a gay man in the military has ever been 
easy, the soldiers depicted in the articles 
chosen by Van Vechten didn't seem bothered 
by dressing up as women and parading 
around in skirts and curls. Quite the opposite: 
they appear to be having a gay old time.


Another poignant example of Van 
Vechten's assertion that gay males existed in 
institutions that seemed to be safeguarded 
from homosexual activity was his bequest of 
the scrapbooks to Yale upon his death. 
Strikingly, he even created a collage that 
commented on the university, then a bastion 
of (mostly white, mostly rich) testosterone: 
"Yale May Not Think So, But It'll Be Just 
Jolly." The words were coupled with a picture 
of a nude man whose genitals are covered 
only by a leaf-cut, possibly, from an ivy 
vine. Van Vechten's bequest to Yale was, 
however, not only his way of insinuating that 
there were gay men in the Ivy League, but 
also an occasion for him to make a statement 
about higher education. He provided Yale 
with a provisional map of his own sense of 
what it meant to be a gay man. At the same 
time, he bequeathed a complex atlas of both 
gay culture's and the mainstream public's 
perspective of homosexual activity during the 
first half of the twentieth century.


While the study of these scrapbooks 
engenders some tension because of their 
pornographic edge, the books represent a 
body of work that has the potential to guide 
Yale into the foundation of gay and lesbian 
studies. He gave them to a major research 
institution like this university for a reason, 
implying that knowledge about sexuality 
should emerge not only in the privacy of our 
bedrooms, but also in the public space of our 
classrooms. As Van Vechten might say if he 
were alive today, Yale may not think so, but 
studying gay and lesbian forms of culture will 
be just jolly.
