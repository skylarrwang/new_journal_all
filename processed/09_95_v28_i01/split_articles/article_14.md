when Barbara Walters does an interview, 
or Dan Rather does an interview, they own 
that interview. They know what they are 
looking for, and they go into [it] as the 
dominant partner in the interview." The 
project's interviewers, Rudof explained, go 
into the room as avid listeners, 
encouraging each survivor to tell his or her 
story in his or her own way. They must 
listen closely so as to keep the story in the 
correct place and time. 


Hartman stressed the importance of 
preventing the survivors' words from being 
influenced by the interviewer. "We say, 
'Don't impose your ideas on the survivor,'" 
he said. "This is a rich archive full of 
anecdotes, stories, history of everyday life 
under grim circumstances." 


Interviewers for the Fortunoff project 
go through an eight-week training course, 
then return each year for three or four 
sessions of refresher courses. "What we do 
or what we recommend to our affiliates is 
that they train the interviewer over a range 
of weeks so that things sink in and the 
interviewers [have time to] do a lot ot: 
reading," said Hartman. 


There are 12 interviewers at Yale for 
the 50 to 70 interviews done each year. No 
new interviewers have been trained since 
1984. "The more people do this, the better 
they become at doing it, so we would 
prefer to stay with the ones we have," 
Rudof explained. 


T
he scope of the Spielberg project 
demands the ability to train large 
numbers of interviewers in a short 
period of time. Prospective interviewers 
only train for two days, or about 20 hours. 
"In the beginning we knew it was 
necessary to have some sort of training for 
the interviewers but we didn't realize [to

what] extent," said producer Moll. 


"In L.A. recently, over a 1,000 
interviewers applied. Two hundred may 
attend the [training) session, and 100 will 
be accepted to do interviews for the 
foundation," said Moll. About 700 
interviewers work for the Survivors of the 
Shoah Foundation across the U.S. and 
abroad. Their newsletter boasts of a 
woman whose team recorded 52 
testimonies in one week. 


Yale, as the first institution to tape 
survivor testimony, has learned a great deal 
in the past 16 years. It helped initiate a 
number of similar projects around the 
world, 
including Spielberg's. 


Yet 
Spielberg's promotional pamphlets merely 
cite Yale as a depository of their tapes, not 
as the creator of this model for oral 
testimony. Although Hartman was 
originally wary of the Spielberg project, he 
is more optimistic today. "They have 
persuaded me during the past yea.r of their 
seriousness, of their capacity to learn," he 
said. 


There are some differences in the 
methods of taping used by Yale and 
Spielberg. Both sides argue that their 
format is most conducive to gathering 
testimony. While the Yale project places no 
time limits on interviews, the Spielberg 
project, in its effort to record as many 
testimonies as possible, limits each session 
to two hours. "We needed to prepare a 
budget so we decided to go with that 
average length knowing that we would 
expand it if necessary, and we have ... we 
don't cut them off," said Moll. "They are 
trained to spend a solid half-hour on 
prewar experiences ... , an hour on war 
experiences, and then a half-hour on 
postwar life, but its not limited." 


The setting of the taping sessions also 
differ. The Yale project has always taped 
outside of the home, beginning in Laub's 
office and then moving to Yale's 
audiovisual center in the basement of 
Street Hall. "We have never really done 
taping in people's homes," said Rudof. 
"You have to worry about soundproofing, 
the lighting is difficult, the phone is 
ringing, the refrigerator motor is 
disturbing ... it's really hard to control." 


In the studio, the survivor is allowed to 
decide whether somebody who has 
accompanied her or him to the site 
remains in the control room during the 
interview. Many prefer to go through the 
interview alone, even when it means 
asking a spouse, or son, or daughter to
wait outside. Giving the survivor these 
options helps them to feel they are in 
control, said Rudof. "I think part of the 
ability to talk about this is to talk about it 
to a stranger in a vety neutral setting," she 
added. "A person's home is loaded, and 
you don't want to pollute [the] house." 


Spielberg prefers to use a fuHy mobile 
camera crew in his interviews, taping in 
the survivors home whenever possible. 
"LogisticaHy, it [is] convenient to film in 
the home," said one of the project's 
producers, June Beallor. "We [find) that 
the survivors [are] more comfortable in 
their own surroundings and that it 
[imparts) their own character, because we 
[are] in their home with their own 
material, their own photographs. It gives 
an insight to who they are as individuals." 


With many of the interviewees being in 
their 70s and 80s, filming at home can be 
much easier, Beallor added. 


Still, one disadvantage of filming in 
people's homes is the tendency for 
survivors to avoid painful or grotesque 
material, either because they do not want 
to make family members uncomfortable, 
or because they are afraid to let loose 
horrible images in the place where they 
spend their time. 


Hartman said that while the Spielberg 
method may ultimately be less effective, 
the simple fact that the project will have 
done 50,000 interviews, as compared to 
Yale's predicted 4,000 interviews, assures 
that it will unearth important material. 
"The statistics are working for them," he 


Hartman's main focus for the Yale 
project is continued expansion to include 
more survivors across the U.S. and around 
the world. "In 1980 we were saying exactly 
the same thing [as the Spielberg people)," 
said Hartman. "We don't have all that 
much time. We've got to do it."

n a small archive room in Sterling 
Memorial Library, a tape slips into the 
VCR. A viewer puts on a headset and is 
alone with the videotaped person. It is not 
the image of a skeletal Holocaust victim or 
the innocent eyes of Anne Frank. This 
individual is someone you might pass on 
the street, a middle-aged to elderly man or 
woman, dressed smartly, with a German, 
Polish, or other European accent. Behind 
them there is only a plain off-white wall, 
or a simple wall-hanging. The only place 
for the viewer's eye to rest is on the 
witness' face. The tapes are unedited; the 
camera never stops or cuts to a different 
angle. The viewer cannot fall back on the 
idea that this is merely fiction. 


Throughout the testimonies, the

perplexity of the survivor today at the 
moral distance from the events they lived 
is painfully clear. They pause, their eyes or 
face wrench, and the silence is heavy. The 
struggle to narrate the immorality of the 
time is excruciatingly vivid. 


Myra L. stays composed through the 
worst of the narrative. Her big eyes 
captivate the viewer, but her posture is 
relaxed, her hands folded on her lap. It is 
as if her stories happened to someone 
else-until she recounts the death of her 
nephew. 


The little boy came to her in the 
Warsaw Ghetto before one of the large 
round-ups. She was a nurse sharing an 
apartment with her two brothers. Her 
nephew, the son of her sister who had died 
at the beginning of the 
Ger~an 
occupation, lived in an orphanage. At one 
point it was announced that all children 
under the age of ten were to be taken to 
camps. The child was only nine-and-a-
half, and small for his size, due to lack of 
nutrition from growing up during the war 
years. He pleaded with his aunt to let him 
stay with her. She describes how she can 
still see his eyes. At the time, in the ghetto, 
she thought he had a better chance in the 
orphanage than with her, so she told him 
no. When the day for round-ups came, 
Myra was told that she and her family 
would be allowed to stay because she was a 
nurse. Looking back she thinks she could 
have saved her nephew easily. She begins 
to cry as the anguish comes through, that 
she really did say no. "The survival will 
was so big that no one was sacrificing 
oneself for someone else," she says. In 
1984, the year Myra gave her testimony, 
this decision of 40 years earlier is 
unbearable. 


The tapes a re unedited; 
the camera never stops or 
cuts to a different angle. 
The viewer cannot fall 
back on the idea that this 
is merely fiction. 


((wen I looked at some of the 
video testimonies I saw 
what a powerful way to 
record and transmit information [it was]," 
said Hartman. "There are qualities that the 
printed record of the historians cannot 
reach adequately. In addition to history 
writing and audio testimony, [video] adds 
something experiential." 


"The story is the point of view of the 
victims," said Rudof. "There are tens of 
thousands of sheets of German documents, 
and if that's the only documents the 
scholar studies, then they will have a very 
biased point of view. So we are trying to 
balance chat. Many of these people will 
never write a memoir, so this provides 
them an opportunity to tell their story." 


There has already been debate about 
the historical importance of this testimony. 
The earliest audiovisual records were 
completed at Yale 40 years after the event. 
Laub, who specializes in trauma studies, 
has noted how the mind tends to encode 
the memories of trauma more deeply than 
other recollections. Memories, though, are 
never as factual as the accounts in the 
military records kept by the Nazis. 


An interview that Laub conducted 
himself exemplifies chis debate. The 
woman he was interviewing described an 
uprising chat occurred while she was in 
Auschwitz. Describing her testimony, he 
wrote, "A sudden intense, passion and 
color were infused into the narrative. She 
was fully there. J\11 of a sudden,' she said, 
'we saw four chimneys going up in flames, 
exploding. The flames shot into the sky, 
people were running. It was unbelievable.' 
There was a silence in the room, a fixed 
silence against which the woman's words 
reverberated loudly, as though carrying 
along an echo of the jubilant sounds
