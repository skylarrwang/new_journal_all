behind outreach programs for high school drop-outs. 
Bey, for example, continues to chat with teenagers since she first approached young adults outside of the dance club. She has created a personal crusade, using condoms and literature from AIDS Project-New Haven. She speaks to them on her own time, without the formal support of her agency, and she exudes passion for her cause. 

Bey is not satisfied with the solo approach, however. As a member of the Adolescent Committee on the Mayor's HIV/AIDS Task Force, she wants to turn her work into a formal program through her employer agency, AIDS Project-New Haven. As chair of the same committee, Spinner hopes to fill in the gaps in outreach programming for out-of-school youth. "Lots of groups supposedly provide services, but they are underutilized and are only a small part of the overall agencies," Spinner says with dissatisfaction. Plans for new projects throughout the city include vans to distribute condoms and material on HIV/AIDS prevention, as well as coordinating services with grass-roots organizations. In addition, the committee meets with parents and families of school drop-outs and with GED/Adult Education students, whose graduation rate mirrors that of public schools. 

Bey's philosophy is driven by the idea that empowerment must precede effective AIDS education. Burroughs and Spinner agree that kids on the street have dangerously low self-esteem. "When you have the attitude that black men don't live beyond the age of 25, why should you care about AIDS?" Bey asks with a hint of despair. Her question reflects what Spinner terms the spirit of "fatalism," the "it doesn't matter, I'll do it anyway" attitude common on the streets. "A child or young adult putting him- or herself at risk knows how not to risk losing his or her life. What lacks is the ability to negotiate protecting him- or herself and the belief in wanting to survive," she says. 

In Bey's mind, state and national government reinforce this attitude. She cites the tightening of AIDS funding across the country. "This country is going through a conservative tide. People still see AIDS as a gay disease. They think, so what if a poor Latino dies? He wasn't contributing to society, he wasn't working, he was using drugs." 

Bey, Spinner, and Burroughs are all interested in employing techniques of peer counseling and training to empower out-of-school youth. Peer education programs have already proven effective in the public schools. Jones provides an 11-week peer education training course on AIDS and STD prevention through her SBHC at Hillhouse High School. Jones has no delusions about where teenagers get their information. "Peers listen to peers. They listen to each other more than me." 

Burroughs already uses this method in the AIDS Interfaith outreach program called Haven's Youth Peer Education (HYPE), which provides outreach services in the form of seminars, a teen hotline, job placement, and distribution of condoms and AIDS information on the streets. Bey wants to provide simultaneous education and employment by creating a peer counseling program with monetary compensation. She echoes Jones' confidence in the effectiveness of training teenagers to teach each other. "Youth listen to youth most, and you have to deal with the fact that a lot of these kids are poor and can't give up their time for free," she says. Bethany agrees that kids listen to their friends even though the information is too often laced with error. "All kids know is what they hear," Bethany says. "They don't know the truth." Bey hopes to mold teenagers not only into peer counselors, but also into their own best supporters within the community at large. "I want to train them to be informed advocates so they can turn around, go to the Board of Education, and advocate AIDS education." 

To fill the place of the schools and SBHCs for kids on the street, Spinner proposes the creation of a drop-in center. "We need a way of addressing the basic human needs for homeless kids. We need to establish trust," she says. Spinner's words outline an environment where out-of-school teens could receive attention, mental and physical health care, and nurturing from trustworthy individuals. 

Although the first step in the HYPE program is attempting to persuade kids to return to school, Burroughs believes that those who refuse must be offered other options. "The kids have to know that there are places to go," he says. 

Bey agrees that one answer to the problem is making activities both available and appealing to teens. She points to the success of such programs as Midnight Basketball and Youth Nights at various community centers in New Haven. 

Though Bey represents AIDS Project-New Haven, she realizes the stigma attached to her organization's title. "These kids don't want to show up anywhere involved with AIDS. They don't want their friends thinking they're infected." According to Bey, teenage drop-outs aren't searching for a teen group meeting at an agency such as hers. Like Burroughs, she thinks they are looking for a place where it is clear that someone cares. 

Jones, Bey, Burroughs, and Spinner are all looking to provide this place. The difference is that Jones has the luxury of working with a clinic for dispensing information and a captive audience surrounding her clinic. For Jones, the SBHC provides a stepping off point by forming an immediate connection between herself and the students. Before even reaching the point at which Jones' work begins, Bey, Burroughs, and Spinner must overcome the challenge of reaching their target group. Not only must they find a drop-out, they must be able to grab his or her attention and hold it long enough to make a difference. Once they do this, the process of changing that teenager's attitude and behavior can begin. 

These modern-day street fighters are looking for more than permission to distribute condoms. They are struggling to establish ways in which kids will allow them to care.
