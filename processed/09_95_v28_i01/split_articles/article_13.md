oanne Rudof tells a story about a l 0-year-old Hungarian boy 
who survived Nazi labor camps. "He went to a Yeshiva. And 
every lunch time he would tell these stories of what he did 
and what he experienced during the war. And one day when 
he went out he heard one child say to another child, 'Let's get 
Marry to tell us more of his bullshit stories, and that's when Marty 
stopped telling his 'bullshit' stories." 

Rudof, the organizer of Yale's Fortunoff Video Archive for 
Holocaust Testimonies, oversees the recording of survivor 
accounts. Only recently have people begun talking about their 
experiences during the Holocaust. "They wanted to talk after the 
war, [but) when they talked, people shut them off," Rudof said. "I 
think one reason that survivors didn't talk is that they perceived 
people didn't want to hear what they had said." 

Today, as some of the youngest survivors of the concentration 
camps reach retirement age, there is more time in their lives to 
remember. Memories they attempted to forget are coming back. 
Suddenly, they want to speak out. 

Two projects are helping them do this by conducting 
interviews in a format that allows the survivors to speak of what 
they witnessed. The process is both painful and relieving. For 
survivors telling their stories, there are sleepless nights both 
preceding and following the interviews. There is also the hope that 
once they have spoken, they will no longer live alone with their 
horrors.

n the third floor of Sterling Memorial Library in the 
Fortunoff Video Archive, thousands of individuals address 
this problem. VHS videotapes, each marked and coded, 
line the walls from floor to ceiling in the small, cramped room. 
Books of Holocaust memoirs are squeezed behind a crowded row 
of desks. Artifacts, books, and tapes have priority over people in 
this room where Holocaust survivors' testimonies are archived by a 
small staff. After 16 years of work, 3,500 testimonies have been 
recorded. 

On the opposite side of the country, in the same trailer where 
production work for jurassic Park was done, the Survivors of the 
Shoah (Hebrew for Holocaust) Visual History Foundation has its 
headquarters at Universal Studios. The modest trailer contains 
crowded desks near a clock-covered wall telling times from around 
the world-Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami/New York/Toronto, 
THE NEW JouRNAL 


.A Holocaust memoriAl erected in D~~eh.u, Germany. 
Buenos Aires, London, Amsterdam/Frankfurt/Johannesburg, 
Paris/Prague, Jerusalem, St. Petersburg, Sydney. These are the 
cities where Steven Spielberg, the acclaimed movie director, has set 
up projects to tape the stories of Holocaust survivors. 

In another trailer, volunteers answer che project's hotline and 
enter facts about survivors into a database. Sixty-four computers 
catalogue the 64 taped interviews expected to come in each day. 
Inside a Universal Studios building, high-tech computers digitize 
the tapes to CD-ROM. In its first year, Spielberg's project has 
taped 3,000 testimonies. The goal is to reach 50,000 in the next 
few years. 

Spielberg's Shoah Foundation has raised $19 million in the 
past year from corporate sponsors such as MCA, Warner Bros., 
UPS, and Silicon Graphics, Inc. The largest grants for Yale's 
Fortunoff project, from the Charles H. Revson Foundation and 
from Alan M. Fortunoff, on the other hand, total less than one 
million. This money will run out by the end of 1996, forcing Yale 
to discontinue taping. 


**The Trauma of Testimony**

P
rior to the late seventies, no real forum existed for survivors 
to relate accounts of the Holocaust. A handful of 
individuals, like Elie Wiesel and Primo Levi, wrote memoirs. 
The majority, however, did not discuss what had happened. Many 
feared, often unconsciously, that no one would listen, and the 
mistakes of the Holocaust would be echoed. 

SEPTEMBER 8, 1995 
"The fear that fate will strike again is crucial to the memory of 
trauma. The act of telling itself becomes severely traumatizing if 
the price of speaking is reliving, not relief," writes Dr. Dori Laub 
in ustimony: Crises of Witnming in Litaatur~. Psychoanalysis, and 
History, a holocaust survivor himself and co-founder of the 
Fortunoff pr.)ject. "If one talks about the trauma without being 
truly heard or truly listened to, the telling might itself be lived as a 
return to the trauma-a re-experiencing of the event." 

The Yale project confronts this reticence, typical of survivors. 
Fortunoff program advisor Dr. Geoffrey Hartman {GRD '53), 
professor of comparative literature at Yale, became involved in the 
project after his wife gave her testimony. He said that, initially, 
survivors did not know whether they could trust the program. 
They knew nothing about Yale, except that it was not a Jewish 
institution, and were unsure what the program hoped to 
accomplish. Much of the work of Hartman and his associates has 
consisted of overcoming the survivors' suspicion of being 
interviewed. The survivor must initiate the taping at Yale and 
most of those who have been taped learned about the project by 
word of mouth or through the newspaper. "When they finally 
came in they gave us their trust and we worked from hand to 
mouth. We weren't high-tech in any way," Hartman sai~. 

For Spielberg, gaining the trust of survivors was less difficult. 
Because of his Jewish background, and particularly because of his 
reputation as the maker of the 1993 film Schindla's List,

**Spielberg's Project**

As survivors reach 
retirement age there is 
more time to remember. 
Memories they attempted 
to forget are coming 
back. They want to speak. 
Holocaust survivors living in the United 
States were less suspicious of him. 

Spielberg drew inspiration for the 
project during the filming of Schindltr's 
List. He was quoted in Tht Ntw York 
Timts as saying, "At least a dozen 
Holocaust survivors journeyed [to Poland] 
using the film as a cushion to find closure 
with their nightmare. They showed up, 
and often through tears began telling us 
their stories. I kept saying to them, 'Thank 
you for telling me, but I wish you could 
say this to a camera because this is 
important testimony.' I asked them if 
they'd be willing to do this, and they all 
said yes." 

In a press release dated August 31, 
1994, Spielberg announced his plan to 
create the largest videotape library of 
The Fortunoff Video Archive on the third 
floor of Sterling Memorial Library. 
18 
Holocaust survivor testimonies ever 
recorded. "We have assembled a bright and 
dedicated team of historians, documentary 
film makers, Holocaust survivors, 
educators, archivists, and communication 
technology experts devoted to preserving 
the memory of the Holocaust," the release 
stated. 

The film maker has since set up two 
institutions: the Righteous Person's 
Foundation, which receives all the profits 
from Schindkr's List, and the Survivors of 
the Shoah Foundation, which carries out 
the work of recording survivors' 
testimonies. Spielberg recruited the 
producers of Schindler's List and a 
Universal Studios executive as the 
executive producers for the project. 
Independent producers June Beallor and 
James Moll run the day-to-day operations. 


**The Yale Project**

n contrast to the grand fund raisers and 
the blitz of press releases that ushered 
in Spielberg's project last year, the Yale 
project began modestly in 1979. Laurel 
Vlock, an independent television producer 
from New Haven, contacted Laub about 
taping survivor testimonies after the 
success of her Emmy award-winning 
documentary on the dedication of the 
Holocaust Memorial on Whalley Avenue. 
NBC had recently produced a series 
entitled Ho/Qcaust, piquing interest in the 
subject. In many ways the television series 
inspired the video project, explained Laub, 
because it exposed the need for an account 
of life during the Holocaust that was not 
steeped in fiction. "[The series) didn't 
seem to comprehend what the Holocaust 
was all about," he said. Vlock and Laub 
joined forces, making use of their 
respective resources and areas of expertise. 
Vlock had access to a camera crew, and 
Laub contacted a Jewish center to find 
survivors willing to talk about their 
experience;. They taped the first 
testimonies in Laub's office. 

"On that first night we expected the 
taping to last two hours," said Laub. "It 
lasted until three in the morning. We 
realized this was something we had to do. 
It was nothing we had heard before, the 
power, the detail, the reflection without 
preparation. We didn't know they had it in 
them; they didn't know they had it." 

The process begins when 
an 
interviewer calls a survivor for a pre-taping 
session to construct a rough outline of his 
or her story. Survivors are encouraged to 
bring any memorabilia they would like 
recorded. Drawing on the information 
given, the interviewer completes further 
research to prepare for the taping. 

"We do a pre-interview work-up so the 
interviewers have a broad outline of what 
they'll hear," says Rudof. "From that pre-
interview outline, [interviewers] hit the 
books and make sure they are familiar with 
all the routes these people travelled." 

Roughly, the process involves a detailed 
study of maps to make sure interviewers 
have a feel for where events took place, 
and a review of the history of each 
location, so experiences can be placed into 
context. 

The camera focuses on the survivor 
from the waist up during an interview, 
zooming in and out to capture each 
gesture and expression. The interviewer 
asks the survivor to begin telling his or her 
story from as far back as possible, usually 
beginning with details about his or her 
birthplace. 

"We don't like to use the word 
'interviewer' because it brings to mind a 
television personality," said Rudof. "And
