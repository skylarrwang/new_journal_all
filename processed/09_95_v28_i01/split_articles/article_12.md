While the world watches, one woma n 
manages to keep Ingalls Rink on track. 
employees answered phones at the volunteer headquarters, hosted 
family members of foreign athletes, and set up the Special 
Olympics home page on the World-Wide Web. Crowds of 
athletes and coaches swarmed into Commons every day for lunch. 
Graciously, the universiry footed the bjll for these activities and 
provided countless resources in the form of staff time. Not that 
Yale did not reap benefits for ·its generosity: when the Special 
Olympi"cs Opening Ceremonies, held at the Yale Bowl, aired on 
prime-time television, cameras captured an oversized Yale banner 
every time they panned the box of guests of honor, President Bill 
and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. Each time a delegation 
of athletes marched onto the decorated field, a sportscaster 
droned, "Now entering the Yale Bowl, the team from .... " 
But for Barbara, the significance of the Opening Ceremonies 
as a media coup for her employer concerned her less than the 
transportation debacle that threatened her dedicated team of 
volunteers at the rollerskating venue. So well-attended were the 
Opening Ceremonies that the traffic congestion prevented bus 
drivers from shuttling the last batch of athletes back t0 their 
dorms until almost 3 a.m. The rumor spreading around the 
officials' room at Ingalls Rink was that buses were going to run an 
hour late, so that bus drivers could rest. Late buses meant late 
athletes and a late start to the day's already packed schedule of 
competition. Even by 12:15 p.m., 15 minutes before competition 
had been scheduled to start, the only athletes that had arrived to 
start warming up were those staying in nearby Yale residential 
colleges. They had walked the short distance up Prospect Street to 
Ingalls Rink. 

In the officials' room, members of the rollerskacing planning

International 
committee, clad in various Special Olympics T-shirts, listened 
intently to Anne Wahlig, head of rollerskating for Special 
Olympics International. Anne spoke clearly and energetically, 
telling her team what to do. Remnants of doughnuts and glasses 
of orange juice lay on tables next to official Special Olympics 
documents. The relaxed attitude in the officials' room had been 
shattered-no more small talk about the celebrities who had 
starred in the opening ceremonies the night before. 

Formally and authoritatively, the head official informed the 
others that they would have to delay competition at least one 
hour so that athletes would have time to arrive and warm up. 
Meanwhile, Commissioner Chesler had pulled the cellular phone 
out of her pocket and was punching the buttons in frustration, 
trying to reach someone who could either confirm the rumors 
about the reasons for the transportation delay or exert his or her 
authority to make the buses run on time. She tried the 
transportation headquarters of the Special Olympics World 
Games and then the movement control headquarters, repeatedly, 
but co no avail. She had to admit, though, that part of the 
problem stemmed from her uncertainty about which of these 
departments was responsible for the transportation of athletes. 

While officials and members of Barbara's rollerskating 
committee hurriedly took notes, the head official discussed details 
about how figures, the first scheduled event, could be judged 
without all the figure rollerskaters present. Suddenly, a volunteer 
burst into the officials' room to announce that the first bus of 
athletes had just arrived. People cheered, then immediately fell 
silent again and listened to the head official, fully aware of time 
pressing forward. 

Even though several more buses of 
athletes and coaches arrived soon 
afterward, Barbara continued trying to 
contact the transportation headquarters so 
that they could send over a supervisor. She 
stayed in the officials' room, using a wall 
phone. Meanwhile, her cellular phone 
protruded from her pocket, and her 
beeper made strange noises at her side. 
While movement patrol put Barbara on 
hold, she fiddled with her beeper, trying 
to shut it off. A committee member 
approached her with a document that 
required her signature. Barbara balanced 
the paper on her lap and signed it with 
her right hand, while her left continued to 
fumble for the beeper. 

While she was still on the phone, a 
committee member informed her that the 
&zrbara Chesler, Commissionn- of 
Roliersltating, attempts to solve a 
transportation crisis. 
THE NEW JouRNAL 

womens' locker room had flooded the 
night before due to an air conditioner 
overflow, but that the staff had been able 
to vacuum up the standing water. Barbara 
smiled and said, "Gotta keep your sense of 
humor about these sorts of things." Earlier 
that morning she had attempted to rectify 
the transportation mess by talking to 
Doug Vaugn, a rollerskating committee 
member. Barbara had asked him whether 
he could redesign the signs so that the bus 
drivers could read them without having to 
step outside the bus. She had spent much 
of her time directing buses, since the 
drivers were unable to see the signs 
indicating where they should wait to 
transport people to various other Special 
Olympics venues. 

B 
ack at the rink, Barbara paused for a 
moment. Realizing there was 
nothing that required .immediate 
attention, she struck up a conversation 
with an athlete who was preparing to 
warm up. "Are you having fun?" Barbara 
asked. The woman looked up and 
shrugged her shoulders, motioning 
towards her ear. Barbara saw a large 
hearing aid and realized that the woman 
could not hear the question. She asked 
again, speaking a little louder, but the 
woman still could not hear. Instead of 
giving up, Barbara turned around and 
asked a surprised coach if anyone nearby 
knew sign language. One woman stepped 
forward, and Barbara asked her to sign to 
the athlete that Barbara was looking 
forward to watching her skate. The 
confusion 
on 
the 
athlete's 
face 
disappeared-she looked relieved that she 
had finally understood. 

Meanwhile, speed skaters tore around 
Ingalls Rink, their faces aggressively 
SEPTEMBER 8, 199S 
focused on the competition ahead. They 
concentrated on performing the correct 
streamlined motions in order to increase 
their speed. 

Several rollerskaters 
competing in the artistic half of the 
program marked out their routines. Chris 
Gaimari, who had competed in several 
previous Special Olympics World Games 
and was favored to win the gold medal for 
the freestyle artistic event, practiced a 
difficult formation called "shoot the 
duck." One of his teammate's roller skates 
traced figure eight lines similar to the ice 
skating figures that were formerly part of 
the Winter Olympics. A woman in a pink 
sequined leotard sat tensely lacing her 
skates, her eyes darting between the· 
asphalt floor of the rink and the eleven 
flags hung impressively above. Warming 
up for the dance event, a couple skated 
around the the rink in sync. 

Michael, an 11-year-old speed skater, 
looked up when his parents and neighbors 
arrived greeting him with loud cheers and 
congratulatory remarks. In fact, almost 
every athlete had several people in the 
bleachers rooting specifically for him or 
her. Almost every spectator knew one of 
the competitors personally; very few 
people had come just to see Special 
Olympics rollerskating. Although Michael

clearly enjoyed the attention, he looked 
slightly annoyed when his mother started 
straightening his shirt. He listened, 
uninterested, as she told him how many 
more Special Olympics flags and pins she 
had bought for him that day. His father 
nudged him and said, "Hey Michael, 
maybe you'll get to see Arnold 
Schwartzenneger tonight during the 
opening ceremonies!" Michael wasn't · 
listening, though. His focus was far from 
celebrity watching; instead, he was 
contemplating how he could perform up 
to his maximum potentiaL He had seen 
his coach and was waving him over. In an 
urgent tone, Michael asked his coach 
whether he should change the wheels on 
his skates to smoother "outdoor wheels." 

In the final moments before the 
'competition began, Ingalls Rink had 
become the still point at the center of 
Barbara's elaborate organizational storm of 
buses, volunteers, and clipboards. All 
Michael noticed was the asphalt, the other 
competitors, and his own dream of 
rollerskating to a gold medal.
