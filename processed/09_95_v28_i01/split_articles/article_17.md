Every day, students i.n New Hoven's schools hear that their oge group has the fastest 
growing rate of HfV-infection. But now, health educators must reach drop-outs 
beyond school walls. 

L
eaving a New Haven dance club one night, Deborah Bey 
spots teenagers huddled together on the street corner. 
Unlike most New Haven residents, she approaches them 
and begins asking questions. As director of education for 
AIDS Project-New Haven, she urges them to participate in a 
youth group sponsored by her agency. The teens' immediate 
response is a refusal to attend. Bey then asks if they are practicing 
safe sex. Their reply is a resounding "no" that echoes in Bey's ears 
and triggers the first step in her effort to turn their response 
around. 

Such responses are prompting the creation of outreach 
programs for kids no longer enrolled in New Haven schools. If 
the teenagers with whom Bey spoke were enrolled in school, they 
would have a School-Based Health Center (SBHC) to provide 
information and support in matters of mental and physical health. 
In particular, condoms would be available to them as part of a 
project adopted two years ago. High school drop-outs such as 
those Bey confronted have no SBHC to inform them about 
AIDS, tell them the benefits of abstinence, or hand them a 
condom. While the SBHCs are themselves a success story, the fact 
that their services reach only those students enrolled in public 
school illustrates their failure to address the needs of all of New 
Haven's youth. 

Supported by a combination of public and private funding 
and staffed by a wide range of health professionals, Connecticut's 
SBHCs (including seven clinics in New Haven} aim to provide 
comprehensive primary health care for public school students. 
According to Connecticut's Department of Health and Addiction 
Services, 13 percent of students using SBHCs in 1993-94 had no 
form of consistent medical care, and 8 percent used the SBHCs as 
their only regular form of health care. A 1993 New Haven Social 
and Health Assessment Survey found that 65 to 70 percent of 
tenth graders were sexually active. Studies done by Yale-New 
Haven Hospital reported that one in 38 pregnant women in New 
Haven deliver HIV-positive infants in New Haven, the highest 
ratio in the United States. In reaction to these statistics, 
administrators and SBHC workers have become intent on taking 
measures to prevent teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted 
diseases. Their first step was establishing more complete services 
regarding sex education and STD/AIDS prevention through the 
SBHCs. 

During the 1993-94 school year, condoms were made 
avaihlble at clinics at Jackie Robinson Middle School, Fair Haven 
Middle School, Wilbur Cross High School, and Hillhouse High 
School. Jane Stern, a nurse practitioner at the Fair Haven Middle 
School Hea,lth Clinic, said that the clinic staff follows strict 
guidelines .regarding the program's intentions. "The goal is AIDS 
prevention, not birth control. The number one issue we discuss is 
abstinence. It's all about AIDS prevention," she says. 

AIDS is not a foreign concept to many students in New 
Haven. Patricia McCann-Vissepo, chair of the Board of Education 
for New Haven Public Schools, believes that one reason parents 
have remained relatively calm about condom distribution in the 
schools is because of the impact AIDS has had on their lives and 
those of their children. "This is not abstract, this is very real to 
people. Four out of 25 kids in ·my son's fourth-grade class lost a 
family member to AIDS," McCann-Vissepo reveals. She believes 
that many parents felt a heavy weight being lifted from their 
shoulders with the beginning of condom availability in the 
schools. "I think they heaved a sight of relief. They said, 
'Someone's doing something, and maybe now I don't have to."' 

While it is too early to know whether SBHCs' new focus 
has decreased the number of HIV-positive students in 
New Haven schools, the program's supporters believe 
that it is proving successful. "I'm sure that in the group of 
children who have been counseled, we have saved someone," says 
McCann-Vissepo. Bey points to the fact that most students see 
from four to 20 AIDS presentations during high school. 
"Something is going to seep in, even if you're not always paying 
attention." Bethany, a junior at Hillhouse High School, believes 
that merely having a clinic on school grounds dramatically 
increases the amount of information students receive. "We spend 
most of the day at school. Now that the clinic is here, we have no
