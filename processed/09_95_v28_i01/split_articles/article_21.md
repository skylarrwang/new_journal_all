"real hockey," when 
there may be more kids 
learning and playing the 
sport with joysticks than with 
hockey sticks? Most Yalies will 
never live anything as violent as 
Strut Fighter, and they may be led to 
believe that in real life most street fights 
involve beautiful Asian women and Sumo 
wrestlers. 

If an everyday fan should enjoy a moment of 
glory dreaming of athletic feats, it lasts only until he 
awakes to his real life, where not every day is an adventure, and he 
isn't a professional athlete. When daily life isn't a sport, a fight, or a 
crusade, the vicarious life within the glowing box can sometimes be 
more enjoyable. Observing his snooze, you can only see an inactive 
couch potato, and you never meet the athlete dwelling within. Sega 
brings out everyone's competitive fire. 

On my hallway, we all fell into this Sega world to different 
degrees. Aaron seemed at times to have difficulty distinguishing his 
own identity from Chun-li's as evidenced by statements such as, 
"Did you see how I kicked Bal-rog!" or "Honda killed me." For my 
part, I've never managed to throw my entire spirit into the game. I 
always enjoy playing, but every now and then I'm struck by the 
absurdity of our video game obsession. Having always played 
sports, I never got over my guilt at playing a game of Sega on a 
sunny afternoon. 

On the first night of finals week last semester there were nine 
people in my common room booing and cheering at the raging 
battle onscreen. Sitting at my desk two rooms away, I grasped the 
tattered baseball I had borrowed that afternoon. Two hundred years 
ago, before the birth of "the National Pastime," this ball would 
have been considered a meaningless lump of twine, cork, and 
leather. The game gave the baJ.lsignif«:ance. 

How could something as simple as a ball ever hope to compete

Sega has become one of Yale's most 
popular pastimes, a video-game 
subculture, transforming otherwise 
peaceful common rooms into something 
out of Lord of the Flies. 
with the electronic complexities of Sega? The video game offers a 
new kind of sport, one with vicarious glory neatly confine·d to a 
television screen. Sports become sterile and clean, indoors and year-
round, requiring no uniforms, equipment, or stretching. And all 
the issues of real life become clear-cut, with the computer acting as 
an electronic arbiter deciding who deserves a penalty and who wins 
the fight. 

Staring at the raised red stitches of the baseball, my thoughts 
were drowned out by yells concerning the fate of Chun-Li. No 
matter how high the Chinny Chi-Ching takes Chun-Li, I don't 
think she'll ever replace the sports of real life. Video games will 
always be fun, but there will never be anything quite like the act of 
throwing a baseball.

I don't want to 
work for The New 
Journal! I have better 
things to do with my 
time than work for a 
magazine that has 
received every major 
writing prize at Yale 
as well as the Rolling 
Stone College 
Journalism Award. 
Besides, you and I· both 
know that The New 
Journal is just a training 
ground for media types 
like TNJ founder, and 
Pulitzer Prize winner, 
Daniel Yergin or P?~St 
TNJ staffer, and editor 
of th~ Chicago 
Tribune, Jack Fuller. 
And you think just 
because The New 
Journal is the oldest 
magazine at Yale and 
also has the largest 
circulation, 1 'm 
supposed to be 
impressed? Give me 
some credit. So, I beg 
of you, go ask someone 
who cares. 

Well, while we won't be seeing him at any TNJ meetings, we would 
love to see you! The New Journal is looking for innovative writers, DTP demigods, 
cutting-edge designers, dynamic photographers, artistes extraordinaires, business 
tycoons, and interested, interesting Yalies in general. If one of the above applies to 
you, come to one of our two snappy organizational meetings or call us.
