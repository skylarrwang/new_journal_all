Jazz is a safe music. You

to throw back a few quick drinks and sink 
into a dream of the past. But between sets, 
Fuller himself bemoans the fact that he has 
been unable to attract young people to 
hear him play. "Yale students would be my 
ideal audience," he says. "Here are people 
thinking, learning, and exploring. That's 
what jazz is all about." 

Internationally renowned jazz pianist 
Harold Danko is optimistic that jazz can 
thrive in New Haven. Danko, who was 
drawn to New Haven a year and a half ago 
to raise children in "the first city outside of 
New York that has it's own identity,"

his students as a way to maintain a core 
audience for jazz. Will Bartlett, who 
teaches jazz with Danko at the 
Neighborhood Music School in New 
Haven's Audobon Court, said that faculty 
jam sessions at the school are one of the 
few opportunities for youths under the age 
of 21 to hear live jazz, and are thus a key 
element in "passing on the tradition."

bar and watch Czech trumpet legend Laco 
Deczi pace back and forth while his sax 
and organ players tangle up in a fast fusion 
sound. 

It seems 
like 
a 
feeble 
understatement with Deczi on the stage. 
Deczi fled communism in 1984 when his
