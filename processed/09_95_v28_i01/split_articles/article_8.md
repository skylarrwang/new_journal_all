The forecast is for rain. Before I left the house, the 
weatherman loomed over the earth with his pointer, 
radiating that weird weatherman glow that comes from 
standing in front of electronic pictures. "There is a 
chance of a thunderstorm Friday or Saturday," he intoned, "as that 
steam really gets built in." There can be no doubt that the steam is 
really built in, but there's still no rain. I have turned to music for 
release, sitting inside a small brick bar on the corner of State and 
Crown where you can hear live music eight times a week. The bar 
is called Cafe Nine.


On stage, New Haven resident Wayne Johnson (often visible 
playing his flute near the entrance to the British Art Center) 
displays a formidable talent in the Joao Gilberto classic, "Girl 
From Ipanema ... Cafe Nine's weekly Saturday Afternoon Jazz Jam 
is in full swing, with life-time New Haven musician Eddie Buster 
presiding on the keyboard. I am practically the only person under 
30 years of age in the entire bar. Most look to be in the stage of life 
that goes by the vastly unspecific designation "middle aged." The 
crowd is very nearly half black and half white. I try to recall if I 
have ever seen that mix before.


Crimson T-shirts with "cafe nine" written on the front and 
"Ego Free Zone" inscribed across the back are for sale behind the 
bar. At least three people are wearing them. Amateur sax player and 
professional dentist Dr. Tony Dioguardi, a participant in the 
Saturday Jams at Cafe Nine since the bar opened five years ago, has 
learned that I am a reporter. He swings by my table while making 
his rounds about the room, where everyone seems to know 
everyone else. The jazz audience in New Haven is like a microcosm 
of the city, he says, "small but tenaciously viable." Cafe Nine, he 
adds, is one of the few places in New Haven where one is likely to 
find "anyone from State senators to guys with no place to go home 
at night."


Jazz in New Haven has lost some of its former grandeur. New 
Haven residents Sam Cannady and Alfonso Vaughn, sitting on 
high stools close to the stage, squeeze their eyes shut in the effort 
to remember the past. They list the names of the supper clubs and 
live music halls that once flourished in New Haven: Sound Track, 
Democratic Club, Golden Gate, Yellow Lantern, the Zebra Room, 
the Quarter Club, among others. They tell of the renowned 
Foundry Jazz Club, which once occupied the space where the 
Koffee? cafe stands today. They describe the morose beatniks who 
used to frequent McTriff's Jazz Club on Chapel Street, today a 
Vietnamese restaurant known as Saigon City. They recount 
appearances made by such jazz greats as Dizzy Gillespie and 
Connecticut native Horace Silver. Jazz and other live music in New 
Haven reached their height in the fifties and early sixties, before 
the dual pestilence of disco and Dragnet (the TV series) swept the 
city.


In the woeful words of Cafe Nine regular Brian Kolterman, 
"disco happened." In the mid-seventies, bar and club owners across 
the country discovered they could draw larger crowds by hiring 
DJs to spin records, which cost far less than hiring a live band to 
perform several sets in the course of an evening.


The advent of television also contributed to the gradual decline 
of live music in the city, Yale School of Music professor Willie Ruff 
(MUSB '53, MUS '54) told me over the phone from his home in 
Alabama. "All the things that brought TV in took live 
performances out," Ruff lamented. He recalled that during his 
freshman year at Yale, in 1949, "the real activity on campus was 
live jazz." Be-bop-playing Yale students like himself "made more 
money than the Dean." Ruff described private parties where Dizzy 
Gillespie entertained a room full of Yalies and girls bussed in from 
Smith College, wrapping up his tale with the unusual 
admonishment: "Your exceedingly square generation has to have a 
committee to entertain [itself]."


TV, and particularly the hit series Dragnet, said Ruff, kept 
people at home in the evenings, even to the point that one movie 
house remains of the eight that once stood within two blocks of 
campus. In the world of television, rock bands replaced jazz bands. 
Rating-crazed television programmers had no room for jazz in even
