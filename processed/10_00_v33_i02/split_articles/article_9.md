Alma Matters 
RALPH NADER COMPLAINED that this year's 
election is nothing but a "Harvard-Yale 
game." Sure enough, if all are faithful to 
their alma maters, the four major-party 
presidential and vice-presidential candi-
dates will visit Cambridge this November. 


Of course, Dick Cheney might skip the 
proceedings, as he dropped out of Yale to 
graduate from the University of Wyoming. 
But George W Bush should certainly be 
there, possibly even at his father's side. Al 
Gore and Joe Lieberman will have to part 
ways, as Gore and his three daughters chee.c 
the Cantabs, while Joe, a New Haven resi-
dent and Yale alum, will say a bracha over 
the Bulldogs. Of course, Ralph won't be 
there--he got stuck at Princeton for his 
bright college years.

Surprisingly, compared with other 
elections over the past 50-odd years, the Ivy 
heritage of this year's crop is unusual. Some 
recent candidates attended name-brand 
schools, such as Harvard, Yale, and 
Princeton. But many more graduated from 
schools that most don't associate with the 
power elite: the University of Minnesota, 
Eureka College, and Whittier College, for 
example. 


In the past century, Harvard College 
has produced two presidents, but Gore 
should be wary of following in their foot-
steps: John F. Kennedy and Franklin D. 
Roosevelt both died in office. W would 
carry on the family tradition, as his father 
was one of only two candidates in history 
to go from the Old Campus to the White 
House. (The other was William Howard 
Taft, better known for his corpulence than 
his achievement in office). Princeton's sole 
candidate, Adlai Stevenson, lost twice. 


Military academies have produced two 
winners (Dwight Eisenhower, a West Point 
man, and Jimmy Carter, an Annapolis 
graduate), 
while 
the 
University of 
Michigan (Gerald Ford and Thomas 
Dewey) and the University of Minnesota 
(Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale) 
produced two election losers apiece. 


Among candidates from lesser-known 
schools, Lyndon Johnson brought home 
the bacon for Southwest Texas Teachers 
College, while Ronald Reagan did Eureka 
College proud for two straight terms. 


Richard Nixon wanted to go to Yale, but 
couldn't afford the travel expenses and 
instead went to Whittier College. He won 
two elections anyway. Perhaps the most 
impressive is Harry Truman, who never 
graduated from Spalding Business College, 
but nevertheless enrolled in the University 
of Kansas Law School at the age of 38. 


So while this year may be a "Harvard-
Yale game," it's the first one in recent mem-
ory. The two schools do produce many of 
the nation's leaders in business, as well as 
most levels of politics, but the presidency is 
a different animal. Few presidents have 
actively marketed themselves as intellectu-
als. The man-of-the-people image is a far 
more popular role, perhaps most masterful-
ly played by Ronald Reagan. The last major 
candidate to present himself as a true 
thinker was Stevenson, who was crushed in 
consecutive elections by the simpler, more 
grandfatherly Eisenhower. (It also didn't 
hurt that Ike won the war.) 


However, Nader's phrase implicates 
something more than mere education: elit-
ism. Coming from a Princeton graduate, 
this may be slightly hypocritical, but the 
issue is worth examining nonetheless. 


Elitism, too, however, cuts against the 
uend of recent history . .PDR was the last of 
the patrician politicians, and he was fol-
lowed by Harry Truman, a gritty populist. 
JFK could be considered as an exception, 
but the Kennedys are a breed apart, eluding 
normal categories. True, George Bush 
exuded a whiff of elitism, but he rode on 
the coattails of the very folksy Reagan, and 
was soon defeated by the down-home Bill 
Clinton. No other presidenr in the past 50 
years has represented any class higher than 
the comfortable middle class. Some, like 
Nixon, were downright poor. 


The take-home message for Yalies who 
aspire to the highest office in the land? 
Transfer ro Bemidji State and learn to play 
the sax.

The Tao of Stephen 
THE BOTILES WERE UNMARKED, which was 
suange. They sat on a card table at one cor-
ner of the New Haven Green. Some cost 
two dollars, some five, and others ten, and 
all were full of liquids of varying color. The 
table was cluttered, gray, and worn. 


Surrounding it were people, bus stops, traf. 
fic, and noise. I gawked at the scene, 
dumbfounded in the middle of the city. 


The vendor at the table noticed me, 
sensed my puzzlement as I stood there. 
Like a good salesman, he approached, all 
energy. He called himself Stephen. He was 
jazz cool, almost mellow, with a smoky 
radiance and dread-locked hair. He grinned 
his introduction, and asked me if I had any 
questions. I bad one: "What are these?" 


Stephen told me that his bottles were 
full of "domestic oil," trying to rouse my 
patriotic spirit. My heart saluted, but my 
gaze froze stoic. I didn't want him to smell 
my weakness--1 buy American. He spoke 
of the tradition surrounding oil, of its age: 
"Oil is as old as man." He paused for effect,
