EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
I n the title of Michelin's new Grem Guide to Yale University and 
New Haven, the city and the institution of higher education huddle 
together, Like college sweethearts in a twin bed, separated by a mere 
conjunction. After 300 years of often strained coexistence, Yale and 
New Haven, it seems, have finally joined together in a blessed 
union that is a worthy subject for one of the world's most respect-
ed travel publishers. The blandishmems surrounding the new 
Guide's birth confirm this impression: At a press conference cele-
brating the Guide's completion, both Yale University Prcsidem 
Richard Levin and New Haven Mayor John DeStefano, Jr., empha-
sized the harmonious rapport between Old Blue and the Elm City. 
For blushing bride DeStefano, the Guide "underscores the benefi-
cial relationship between the city and Yale." Levin, the proud 
groom, echoes these sentiments: "I can think of no better way co 
honor our partnership." Naturally, I approached Michelin's Guide 
expecting a cheerful depiction of its nvo subjects and the union that 
ended years of strife, some sort of Mid-Connecticut Night's D"am. 
However, the saga is anything but romantic or comic, more 
akin to that of Aeneas and Dido or Catherine and Heathcliff than 
Hermia and Lysander. The story revealed is more like a bad high 
school play in which the school's diva grabs the spotlight and forces 
the more timid actors into the unlit corners of the stage. Rather 
than celebrating a peaceful and prosperous relationship, the Guide 
seems to parody the Yale-centrism that many see as che perpetual 
stumbling block in Yale-New Haven relations with its onslaught of 
Yale matter and its dearth of New Haven content. After wading 
through a Cervantes-length account of the University, one almost 
comes to believe that Michelin intentionally ignored irs Sancho 
Panza in favor of rosy tales of its Don Quixote. 


One need not even open the Guide co get a sense of irs true 
focus. Although the words "Yale University and New Haven'' are 
emblazoned across the center of the cover, all the other graphics fea-
ture only Yale. Directly under the ride is a picture of a corner of the 
Branford courtyard, the vista most over-used by Yale's publicity 
machine. Beneath this photo, Handsome Dan sits on the Yale 
Fence, a Georgian window peeks out from behind its cover of ivy, 
and the now-ubiquitous tercentennial logo shines forth in pure 
white text. Together, the trinity proves the equity proclaimed by the 
Guide's ride to be as illusory as the University's policy on alcohol 
consumption. The only reminder of the non-Yale Elm City is 
indirect at best: small, vertical text reading "with hotels and restau-
rants." This, despite the Guide's own acknowledgement that New 
Haven's trademark green and three churches are "the most beautiful 
and most photographed view in New Haven." In a guide that 
ostensibly depicts New Haven, the relegation of its most beautiful 
sight to a murky watercolor at the bottom of two later pages seems 
too contradictory to be accidental. 


The first eight pages, a visual tour preceding the text, reinforce 
this impression with a blitz of Yale-related images that overwhelm 
the occ.'lSional mention ofNew Haven, present only when absolute-
ly necessary: on the ride page, the table of contents, and the first 
map. The successive visuals seem to be drawn from the Admissions 
Viewbook. Included are the Yale Seal in its full-color, Larin and 
Hebrew glory; a watercolor of Harknj!SS Memorial Tower and the 
Memorial Gateway (minus construction workers and dumpsters); a 
student poring over her work under autumn leaves; and a map that 
features all of Yale but lacks such New Haven destinations as 
Wooster Square, Ease Rock, and Long Wharf. 


When the introduction proper begins, New Haven reencers the 
picture. Because it predates che University by some 63 years, the city 
necessarily occupies the first half of the first page of the introduc-
tion's history section. However, with the arrival of Yale in the mid-
dle of the page, New Haven almost disappears. Throughout the sec-
tion, Michelin glosses over grand events in New Haven history in 
favor of petty particulars concerning Yale. Two of the most impor-
tant events in New Haven's hiscory, the Amistad affair and the con-
cealment of the regicides at West Rock, receive nearly the same 
amount of space as the opening of Yale's Henry R. Luce Hall. 


After a short list of hotels, restaurants, and night spots, Yale 
receives 42 pages of the Guide, with headings that cover such cru-
cial topics as "Yale Today," "Traditions," "Student Life," "Legacy," 
"Three Centuries of Growth," and "Evolution of the Campus." 
This section includes two walking tours of the campus, describing 
in detail everything from the phallic wonder of Harkness Tower to 
the grandiose mansions on Hillhouse Avenue to the unforgettable 
tablet in Berkeley's wall commemorating the site of Yale's first tele-
phone exchange. It also includes four-page guides to both the 
British Art Museum and the University Art Gallery, not only 
describing in detail the different sections of each museum floor, but 
also providing lessons in art history for the uninitiated reader. 


If one disregards the occasional Yale office in the New Haven 
Savings Bank building, pages 64 and 65 showcase the Guide's first 
Yale-less photo. These are followed by the ten pages that constitute 
New Haven's portion of the Guide. Although New Haven is, sur-
prisingly enough, much larger than Yale, the Guide provides only 
one extensive walking tour of the city and a paragraph-long 
Wooster Square tour. The main walking tour seems to embody the 
work's main flaw: At no point can the tourist turn in a complete cir-
cle without seeing Yale University. The tour is more an inculcation 
of the Yale administration worldview than a way to become 
acquainted with New Haven. Unlike the detailed four pages that 
the Yale University Art GaJiery receives or the one page devoted to 
the Collection of Musical Instruments, only one paragraph deals 
with the New Haven Colony Historical Society. Like Kline-Biology 
THE NEW JouRNAL 


The Yale-centrism of the Guide is most likely a result of its 
progenitors, the folks at the Yale Tercentennial Office. A guide by a 
world-renowned publisher that skips over as much of New Haven 
as possible seems to be the perfect accompaniment to a celebration 
that will be broadcast throughout the world so that alumni need 
not return to New Haven. However, the Guide is nowhere near as 
subtle nor as cunning as the University's standard modus operandi; 
the obtrusiveness of the Guide's slant leads one to search for answers 
outside the frequently shadowy operations of the University. In fact, 
the impression that remains with the reader afrer finishing the 
Guide -that something is missing, that some crucial part has been 
withheld-is so strong that this failure seems intentional. Could the 
lack of New Haven content be a deliberate ploy on Michelin's part 
to critique and subvert the University's magnificent tercentennial 
celebration with a chilling portrait of unrelenting Yale-centrism? In 
accepting Yale's proposal and publishing this opus extolling the 
wonders of Old Blue, was Michelin able to bite the very hand that 
fed it the idea without arousing any notice? Could Michelin, like 
Shakespeare, Moliere, or other subtly subversive scribes, have man-
aged to indict the institution that it claims to praise? 


By packaging a version of The Yak (albeit somewhat more 
Yale-centric) under a title that includes both Yale and New Haven, 
theÂ· Guide parodies the very concept it embodies. Still, the question 
of authorial intent remains. Did Michelin merely do an inadequate 
job, or did the company succeed in criticizing its own benefactors? 
If Michelin chooses to turn the university-town theme into a series, 
future guides may provide an answer: a Princeton guide focusing 
entirely on the golf courses, yacht clubs, and BMW dealers near cam-
pus; a Brown guide without any sort of logical structure that allows 
the reader to choose his or her own path through the text; a 
Harvard guide "that leaves the reader miserable but sure that some-
how, someday, the reading experience will prove invaluable. Any 
one of these works would prove that Michelin intended much more 
than praise in its Guuu to Yale and New Haven.
