alzenia Henry's son was awakened in the middle of a 
cold December night last year, shackled, hog-tied, and 
put on a bus heading south. Twenty-two hours later, 
be arrived at Wallens Ridge State Prison, a super-max-
imum ("supermax") security facility in Virginia, and was placed in 
a cell where he would spend 13 hours of each day for the next six 
months. Neither Marcus Henry, a 23·feat!-<>ld New Haven man 
who is serving the sixth year of a 45-year prison sentence, nor his 
fumily was warned chat he would be moved out of state. Only when 
one of Marcus's friends called Ms. Henry did she learn that her son 
was in Virginia. "I liken it to slavery,'" she~ me. "They sold our 
fumilies 200 years ago, and rhef're dblns it again now, selling black

Armstrong assured the public that only the "wont of the worst" 
criminals-those with the highest scaarity &evels, longest sentences, 
and disciplinary problems 
,.~ lle.ilig sent, a fitting group for a 
supermax prison. But a brief look at'the list of transferred inmates 
belies the use of these criteria. Many have sentences of between one 
and three years, and over 40 are serving time for non-violent drug 
offenses. It's difficult ro call even Marcus Henry, who is serving 45 
years, the "worst of the worst." When Marcus was 17, he and some 
friends got high and went to an after-hours club to steal drug 
money, his mother told me. During the robbery, a man inside the 
club shot at them, and they fired back, killing him. Marcus was 
charged with felony murder and robbery, and his court-appointed 
attorney encouraged him to accept a plea bargain, a typical recom-
mendation of over-burdened public defenders. Marcus pled guilty 
to manslaughter and twQ counts of robbery. "I love my child dear-
ly," Ms. Henry told me. "The last place I expected him to ~nd up 
was in jail. He's not the monster the Department of Correction is 
making him out to be." 


Marcus is no-longer incarcerated at Wallens Ridge. This past 
July, he and 156 other transferred Cbnnecticut inma~ were moved i 
to Greensville Correctional Center in Jaran. Varginia. Greensville is I

If the contract is a money-saver for Connecticut, it's a money-
maker for Virginia, a proud entrepreneur in today's corrections 
business. Some six years ago, Republican George Allen's get-tough-
on-crime rhetoric won him Virginia's gubernatorial election. 
fUtlllo,um crime had been on the decline in the state since 1993, 
iio'~rertllor Allen introduced barshec sentencing laws and massive 
prison construction. Prison spending grew twice as bst as spending 
higher education, totaling over $1 billion in less than a decade. 
Virginia incarcerates roughly 30,000 of its citizens, and near-
40 percent of this prison population is classified as maximum-
issues groups, and the National Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People, have called the mix of rhese guards and prisoners a 
disaster waiting to happen. Nearly all of rhe guards are white, while 
roughly 8o percent of the prisoners transferred from Connecticut 
are black or Latino. Prisoners claim they have been taunted with 
racial slurs, and Confederate flags and memorabilia decorate guards' 
cars and the warden's office. But racism is only part of the reason 
inmates have had difficulty adapting to Virginia's prison system. 
Wallens Ridge does nor provide any educational, religious, or reha-
bilitative programs, on which the Connecticut prison system prides

the second-highest percentage in the 
States. Nonethdess, Allen's prison-building

According to prisoners, however, even these abuses pale in

One abuse undeniably suffered by all of the transferred inmates 
is the distance they have been caken from their families. Big Scone 
Gap is roughly 720 miles from New Haven, which makes visiting 
difficult or impossible for prisoners' families. Ms. Henry has only 
been co visit Marcus once since he was moved co Virginia, and 
the trip cost her about $200. The cost of phone calls is another bur-
renewed its contracr wirh Virginia for another year, as government 
officials claimed their hands were tied. Earlier this year, public 
opposition quashed plans co convert New Haven's Goffe Street 
Armory into a new jail. At the same time, the public clamored to 
have the prisoners returned from Virginia. But, said officials, you 
can't have it borh ways: If you don't want a prison in your backyard, 
den. Phone companies know a profit-maker 
when they see it, and prisoners are perfect cus-
tomers: Phone calls are one of their few links 
to family and friends, and they must make 
most of their calls collect using whatever carri-
er the prison chooses. So, entering into mutu-
ally-profitable contracts with DOCS across the 
nation, phone companies charge inmates up 
to six times the normal rate for a call. Ms.

incarcerated in Connecticut, but since he was

For che most pare, scare legislators' opin-
ions about che transfer of prisoners co Virginia 
correspond co their feelings about the prison 
industry in general. Those who advocate a

moved co Virginia, they have only been able to speak once every 
cwo weeks. Still, Ms. Henry has been spending thousands of dollars 
co maintain chis minimal contact. 


THE TRANSFER OF INMATES from 
Connecticut co Virginia has generared vocal opposition, not only 
from inmates' families and prison issues groups, bur also from the 
Prison Guards' Union, which fears losing jobs. Bur despite concerns 
on all sides, there are no plans to bring inmares home; according to 
the DOC, there's just no space in Connecticut. The state recently

ever, undersrands the issue differently. He supports sending prison-
ers co Virginia out of necessity, but he finds fault with the entire 
prison system. To him, the transfer is the lesser of two evils. "First 
and foremost to me is that we don't build more prisons," he says. 
"Building prisons doesn't work. No matter how many beds we ere-
ace, we fill them up." Dyson also points out chat Connecticut has 
spent twice as much on corrections as on higher education since 
1991. "What's in better shape, our schools or our prisons?" he asks 
me rhetorically. "And we deem oursc:lves a civiliud society. We sac-
rifice our young co demonstrate chat we're rough on crime." 


According to Dyson, sending prisoners to Virginia allows state 
fUnds to be given to education that would otherwise be swallowed 
up by prison construction. 


But as Dyson acknowledges, framing the debate as only two-
sided glosses over an important question: Why has Connecticut's 
prison population surged to a dangerous level of overcrowding? 
Between 1960 and 1980, the state's prison population was relatively 
stable, hovering around 4,000. Today, it is approximately x8,ooo, 
and projections for the year 1005 are as high as 22,000. Curiously, 
violent crime in Connecticut decreased by roughly 20 percent in the 
past decade, but the inmate population keeps growing. 


The paradox is easily explained. Prisons are flooded largely due 
to the War on Drugs. Today, over two-thirds of Connecticut's 
inmates are serving time for non-violent, mostly drug-relared, 
offenses; more than 1,000 are incarcerated solely for drug posses-
sion. Also contributing ro the soaring prison population are the 
mentally ill, who found themselves forced out of closing mental 
hospitals in the 198os and 1990s only co be re-instirutionaliud-
this time in jail. Esrimates of the number of mentally ill inmates 
range from five ro 14 percent of the prison population. 


Connecticut's Prison and Jail Overcrowding Commission also 
aruibutes the growth to the "admission of 14 and 15 year olds due to 
[a] shift in the Juvenile Justice System." 


As more and more drug offenders are thrown in prison, 
Connecticut's drug rehabilirarion facilities become increasingly 
insufficient. Today, there are only 262 beds available in residential 
treatment centers and over 11,000 inmares eligible for those beds. 
So instead of being rehabilitated, drug offenders are sent to prison 
and discharged without treatment. This makes communities less 
safe, argues Sally Joughin, who co-founded People Against Injustice
