problem bluntly. "People are reluctant co 
talk about it because there's this hysteria 
surrounding drugs. There's this sense that 
while I might be able to get away with per-
sonal use, any public advocacy will put my 
personal use in jeopardy. People are afraid 
of being targeted and labeled as users." 

The same stigma surrounding drug 
use that allowed the amendment to be 
passed in the first place may prevent those 
most directly affected from coming for-
ward to protest. This provision is a new 
threat to the educations of the 39 percent of 
Yale students )'V)to are on financial aid, yet 
"We've been kind of hesitant to single out 
students who are on financial aid as spokes-
people," says Cox, "and even people who 
we've found don't want to come forward." 

On a national scale, the movement appears 
to have the same problem. The website for 
the Coalition for HEA Reform, a nation-
wide group devoted to the cause, makes an 
appeal for stories from people who have 
lost their aid under this provision: "We 
urgently need to hear from students who 
have been affected by this law, especially 
students who are willing to go public." 

However, only one such story, reported by 
Mother jon~ about a student at Antioch 
College, is linked to the site. 

So far, there are no HEA poster children 
at Yale. "This is the first aid year where the 
Feds actually asked question 28," says 
Storlazzi. "At Yale, we haven't had anyone 
say yes, so there's no University policy yet. 
There is a sense that it's not likely to come 
up." But it strains credulity to think this is 
because Yale students are not using drugs. 
Surveys show that about half of u.s. high 
school students try an illegal drug before 
graduation, and any Thursday night Bong 
& Keg attendee will tell you that this per-
centage probably increases during the Yale 
freshman year. It's also not because the 
New Haven Police aren't making drug 
arrests. In 1995, the most recent year for 
which statistics were available, there were 
2.,682 drug-related arrests in New Haven; 
612. of them were for simple marijuana pos-
session. 

So why the widespread complacency 
in the face of this imminent threat to hun-
dreds of srudents' means to getting an edu-
cation? To put it simply, Yale students aren't

often arrested for drug use, or anything 
else. In 
1998, the most recent year for 
which statistics are available, the Yale Police 
made three drug arrests on or near the 
campus, none of which involved students . ., 
This holds true even when students fit ': 
police stereotypes. "As a black man in New 
H aven, I feel cops treat me as a suspect," 
Lawson told me, recounting three separate 
experiences during his time at Yale in 
which he excited sudden, unfounded suspi-
cion from the NHPD. He adds, "My Yale 10 
basically served as a get-out-of-jail-free 
card." Each time, proving his student status 
resulted in a hasty apology from the cops. 

A renewed willingness on the part of 
police to arrest Yale students was demon-
strated in the last week of September, when 
a fraternity party on High Street led to 
seven alcohol-related arrests by New Haven 
officers in a campaign against street noise. 
Yet as long as drug use at Yale remains a rel-
atively private, quiet activity in living 
rooms and common rooms, the current 
stalemate in the campus War on Drugs is 
likely to continue, despite the new legisla-
tion's stated intention. Besides, Scorlazzi 
points out that simply asking students 
whether they have been convicted of a drug 
offense is the least efficient and accurate 
way to find out. "What I fmd interesting," 
he says, "is that the Federal Government is 
depending here on the honesty of appli-
cants. Usually they're so careful about link-
ing other databases, and it would certainly 
be easy for them to discover who was a con-
victed drug offender." At least for now, the 
HE.A amendment is more a symbolic state-
ment than a serious deterrent to a behavior 
that almost no one publicly defends, but 
everyone silently acknowledges.
