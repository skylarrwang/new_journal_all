in 1996 to respond to rampant abuses of 
the criminal justice system. The group, 
which Dalzenia Henry joined after her son 
was moved, has organized around a variety 
of issues including, most recently, the 
transfer of prisoners to Virginia. Joughin 
believes that instead of transferring prison-
ers out of state, Connecticut should focus 
on finding better solutions at home. Much 
of her emphasis is on Alternative to 
Incarceration Programs (AlPs). If non-vio-
lent drug offenders and the mentally ill 
were sent to rehabilitation centers rather 
than prisons, she told me, there would be 
no need to send prisoners out of state, and 
everyone would be better off. "Prison 
should be a system of correction, not only 
punishment," she said. "Or they should at 
OctoBER 13, 2000 
least stop calling it the Department of 
Correction." 


It comes as a surprise to many that 
AlPS, like drug rehabilitation centers and 
mental hospitals, are cheaper than prisons. 
Substance abuse programs, for example, 
run about $5,000 per person per year, while 
it costs over $25,000 to keep a person in 
prison. According to recent polls, the peo-
ple of Connecticut support treatment pro-
grams, at least in theory. Why, then, isn't 
the state filled with AlPS rather than pris-
ons? The answer is money and policies. 
Legislators don't want to be labeled "soft on 
crime" for supporting treatment rather 
than incarceration, especially in an election 
year. Furthermore, just as no one wants to 
live next door to a prison, no one wants to 
live next to a rrearment center, and there 
are more factors stacked against AlPS. 


Connecticut pays towns to host prisons, 
which do not pay property taXes. For pris-
ons, this PILOT (Payment In Lieu OfTaxes) 
is 100 percent of the assessed property 
value, but the state pays less for facilities 
like treatment centers. Towns can also 
negotiate for certain benefits when they 
agree to build a prison. For example, 
Cheshire, which is home to five of 
Connecticut's prisons, has its sewer system 
managed and paid for by the state. "T he 
rown can make out like a bandit," Dyson 
told me. Four more Connecticut towns are 
now poised to rake in profits. 


In 
September, East Lyme, Montville, Somers, 
and Suffield submitted applications to the 
state for yet another planned prison expan-
sion. One East Lyme selectman said that 
enlarging the town's prison would be like 
bringing in ten new businesses. 


The inmate population is expected to 
swell by 4,000 over the next five years, and 
Connecticut has no plans to check this 
growth by funding rehabilitative programs. 
Twenty-five million dollars of this year's 
budget are already earmarked for incarcera-
tion. As long as prison building remains 
both politically expedient and a source of 
profit for localities, few of those in power 
will have a reason to take the long view-
and we will all pay the price.
