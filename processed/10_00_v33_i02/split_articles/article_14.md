record in support of the drive to register black voters in Mississippi. Along with 100 other 
volunteers from Yale and Stanford, lieberman was heading south to help voter registration 
efforts and the gubernatorial campaign of black candidate Aaron Henry. He had the sym~ 
bolic import of his mission in mind. The Chairman was going to show black Mississippians, 
as he wrote, "that there are white men who care about their plight ... whose insides burn 
with anxiety and guilt when they consider the way in which other white men have sought 
to rob the black man of his humanity." Writing in the first person singular, Lieberman 
detailed and defended the reasons for his upcoming departure to the poorest state in the 
nation. He explained his system ofbeliefs, how life is a call for "love among men," and why 
the present situation demanded the commitment of all men sworn to ending injustice. His 
style was neither overwrought nor overly self-conscious. It bespoke the conviction and self-
assurance of a much older man: "I am going to Mississippi because there is much work to 
12 
be done there and few men are doing it. I 
look to the facts of the history of this state's 
treatment of its Negro citizens and I see 
very little but hatred and painful dehu-
manization. . . . It alJ becomes a personal 
matter to me. I am challenged personally." 

To be sure, "Why I Go to Mississippi" 
is not entirely free from moralizing or self-
righteousness. At one point, lieberman 
paraphrases Ecclesiastes and quotes the 
Talmudic fathers en route to proclaiming, 
"This country is one or it is nothing." But 
in all, the "Senator" (as he was already 
being called) showed some real statesman-
ship. In the space of 1300 words, Joe 
Lieberman searched himself and his own 
motives, the criticisms of his opponents, 
and the call to action to which his heart 
had led him. 

But impressive as it was, the thunder 
of the Senator's column was stolen by a 
short, unassuming piece in the adjacent 
column. 

In 
"Communications," 
the 
Editorial Page's daily space for letters, 
lieberman printed a brief poem by "D. 
Milch, 1966." It was untided and addressed 
simply to the Chairman of the News. It 
began: 
So you're gonna belp the poor nigger-
Well, here's news, white boy, 
This nigger don't want your white 
man's help. 

And Milch was just getting started. 

Amazingly, the first three lines are almost 
polite compared to the 20 that follow. In 
the course of three increasingly angry stan-
zas, the sophomore goes on to call 
Lieberman "white boy" five times; to claim 
"You ain't gonna get a cause out of my 
skin"; to explain "You still got to count to 
ten miUion by ones"; and to demand, 
"Look me in the eye an' call me brother," 
all before ending with a disarming plea: 
just teU me we aU got to die together, 
So that there':: just two guys cryin'. 
That's all I want, white boy: 
A chance to cry with you, together. 

"Why I Go to Mississippi" might well 
be the first of Joe Lieberman's many spodit, 
news-grabbing declamations over the 
years-and not only because of its tone of 
impassioned moralism or irs spirited call to 
public service. Even more telling is his deci~ 
sion, as Chairman of the News, to share the
