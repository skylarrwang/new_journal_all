T 
he last page of the playoff edition of the New Haven Ravens 
program tells the story of Rally and Ribbi's wedding. 
Apparently, the two mascots became Mr. and Mrs. Raven on 
August 6 at Yale Field. Guests at the wedding included the Mariner 
Moose, who flew in from Seattle, and local mascot Handsome Dan, 
the Yale Bulldog. Immediately following the wedding. a baseball 
game was played. 


Baseball doesn't seem to be a top priority for Ravens fans. lc's 
certainly on the list-maybe above the sumo matches chat occa-
sionally occur between innings, probably below the fireworks that 
follow some games, and definitely below cotton candy and beer. 
Way below beer. 


This doesn't make it easy for the Ravens marketing team. 
When a Major League team makes che playoffs, selling tickets is not 
a problem. For the Ravens, the opposite is rrue. Playoff games are 
not on the schedules printed at the beginning of the season, so peo-
ple don't plan on coming to them. The playoffs also happen during 
che school year, when parents are not as likely to bring their chil-
dren. So the Ravens resort to gimmicks like fireworks, giveaways, 
and having twice as many mascots as your average baseball team. 


On September 14, the Ravens hosted game three of the Eastern 
League championship series. They had split the first two games with 
the Reading Phillies, so the title was well within reach. Game three 
also happened to be college night-for three bucks, a few friends 
and I gor seats at the picnic tables behind the right field fence, free 
food, and two-dollar drafts. "Free" tee-shirts, too--if you tipped the 
bartender. Because we were basically the only ones out there, we got 
a lot of attention: from other funs, from Ravens employees, from 
the players, and from the mascots. The mascots' attention was 
something we probably could have done without-let's just say that 
Rally wasn't being too faithful to his new bride or all that respectful 
of my friends' personal space. 


At first, everybody else in the crowd seemed to be enrhusiastic 
about the game, but that was probably just because beers were half-
off when the Ravens were up. We kept cheering well after the 
Ravens took the lead, bur that was probably just because we were 
drunk. By cheering for the Ravens I mean, of course, harassing the 
opposition. In particular, we belitded the Phillies right fielder's abil-
ity, his home town, and members of his family whom we had never 
met. And with such a small crowd, he heard every word we said. I 
know, because 
he laughed at us. The Ravens players heard us, too, because their 
right fielder tossed me a baseball, and the pitchers in the bullpen 
joined us when we started the wave. 


That one tossed baseball began the greatest friendship with a 
professional athlete that I've ever had. I didn't know it at the rime, 
but one short day later, I'd be ar a bar putting back drinks with 
Keith Gordon, ex-Major Leaguer. Our enthusiasm had paid off: 
Two sales executives who were working the game came over to 
thank us for coming our, and we ended up with free tickets to the 
next night's game. 


The Ravens had won, and we were back for the series final-
thjs time behind the home dugout. That night, the Ravens became 
Eastern League champions, clinching the "World Series of AA base-
ball on the East Coast of the United States of America." I found 
myself chanting "We're Number One!" along with the funs and 
players, celebrating my two-day-old loyalty. We felt like we were 
part of the ream, especially after our friends from the night before 
stopped by to talk to us, and even more so when they invited us to 
TK's to celebrate with the Ravens players and staff. 


It was there that I ran into Keith Gordon, the Ravens player 
who had thrown me that baseball. And that's how he ended up buy-
ing me drinks. There was really no way to turn him down. I tried 
all the excuses I could come up with. I told him I had already had 
a couple beers. He grabbed the waitress and told her to get me a 
Sam Adams. I reminded him that I was there as a journalist. He 
yelled across the bar and cold the waitress to make it two. With a 
glass of beer in each hand, I pointed out that I weighed much less 
than the average professional athlete. He bought me another beer. 


Gordon's Major League scats aren't exactly impressive. In three 
games with the Cincinnati Reds in 1993, he had one hit in six at-
bats. He struck out twice. He told me he got called up by the 
Orioles for a week but I guess he never batted in Baltimore. In his 
eleven years in professional baseball, he didn't last a month in the 
Majors. He might never make it back. Bur he didn't seem upset by 
that. He almost quit before the season and may not play next year. 


Even if Gordon does return to baseball, he won't be coming 
back to New Haven. For the last few seasons, the Ravens have been 
a farm team for Seattle, and now the Mariners are pulling out of the 
deal, taking the players with them. It's not a surprise. New Haven 
doesn't appreciate the team-attendance records are the lowest in 
the league. Next year, the Ravens will still be here, bur a new flock 
of players will play for the St. Louis Cardinals farm system. Chances 
are, Mark McGwire won't be among them. And maybe most of the 
Ravens won't make the big leagues. But when has Mark McGwire 
ever bought me a beer?
