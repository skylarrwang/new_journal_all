LETTER FROM PRAGUE 
What I saw at the revolution 
I'm in an abandoned builcling full of anarchist 
squatters, talking philosophy with Serotonin 
and Siv. Actually, Siv is doing most of the talk-
ing. 


He's an English philosophy student, and 
we met him wandering in the cold Prague 
night, looking for a place to sleep. Serotonin 
and I were catching a night tram over to the 
squat when bright-eyed Siv stepped from the 
shadows carrying a bedroll. 


Siv is 23, from PortSmouth, and he's giv-
ing me his Hegelian explanation for why he 
came to demonstrate against the IMP. "History 
is a progression," he says. "There's a direction 
to events, and a certain truth, or oneness, or 
unity, you know, underlying it all." Siv is lying 
on his sleeping bag, head propped on a hand. 
His sheep's-wool shock of brown hair sticks out 
philosophically. "And this IMF conference, this 
meeting, it's part of a progression that I think 
I've been seeing unfolding for awhile now." Siv 
is on the floor by Serotonin. I get the couch 
because I'm willing to deal with spiders. 


Our room is less vile than the rest because 
it's a workspace. 
These anarchistS produce a 
newspaper, and irs refuse--paper scraps, books, 
leftist magazines and empty beer bottles--clogs 
the place. We had to squeeze by the rusty 
printing press just to get in the door. 


Hard-core music pounds below 
us. The 
odors of beer and vomit waft up through dirt-
crusted floorboards. They mix with the smell 
of primer's ink and Siv's overpowering feet. He 
is off from school, working on organic farms 
across Europe, and he doesn't shower much. I 
rub my nose, wishing my head cold were 
worse, and keep listening. 


"You know, there were the demonstrations 
in Seattle, ones in Washington, actions in the 
U.K. 
Things are happening, I think," he says. 
"Things are changing. I want to be here to be 
pact of it. If I can find a reason to give for 
why I'm here, I think that's it." 


He doesn't ask me why I'm here and I 
don't bring it up. I wrote for Prague's only 
English weekly last summer and struck a deal 
with them for the fall: They pay airfare, and 
BY E RIC G ERMAN 
I cover the annual IMP and World Bank meet-
ings unpaid. My qualifications are scant. A week 
ago I was only vaguely aware that the IMP or 
World Bank existed, and my presem "expertise" 
derives from a pile of articles I nervously absorbed 
on the plane. 


But the paper needs scoops, and I'm poor. 
T his means I sleep with protesters. As the 
youngest staff writer, I simply have to "find out 
from those kids why they think they're here." 
So I don a black hooded sweatshirt and try to 
smell the zeitgeist. 


Rubbing my nose again, I ask Siv if these 
demonstrations share an underlying clirection, if 
these events have a goal. What world-historical 
endpoint are we seeking? He is quiet for some 
time: "Empathy," he says finally. "People having 
more of an understanding of the feelings and 
lives of others. If those guys in the IMP hear 
us, maybe it will help them see that what they 
do has an effect on the lives of millions of 
other people. Maybe it will make them be more 
careful. Feel some empathy for the people they 
are hurting, you know?" 


Siv turns to Serotonin and asks, "Do you 
know this word, 'empathy'?" Serotonin is 20, 
from Dresden, and his English-while better 
than our German-is patchy. Bent over a joint 
that won't come together, he hasn't heard a word 
Siv has said. His real name is Sven, but I've 
called him Serotonin ever since we met at a rave 
last summer where, with shaky-ecstatic hands, he 
scrawled his address on a napkin for me--sero-
tonin@som~thingindeciphtrable.com. He cooks in 
Dresden, earning just enough to rent a flat, 
travel, and rave. After we pacted last summer, 
Serotonin rave-hopped until he ran through his 
money. He told me once that, if it were up to 
him, he would be a techno-gypsy. 


Siv 
asks 
him 
again 
about 
empathy. 
Serotonin shrugs and passes 
the joint. Siv 
smokes and then tries to define the word. It 
takes awhile. I ask Serotonin why he came to 
demonstrate. "I heard about Seattle," he says. "I 
saw on TV the rioting and I want to see if this 
will turn out the same." His rave-wear sags off 
THE NEW JouRNAL 


his slouchy, string-bean frame as he sits 
on the floor. "You weren't in Seattle, were 
you?" Serotonin is the fiftieth person to 
ask me that since my arrival. No, I was-
n't there, I say. It's too bad you missed 
such a great time, he tells me. "I hope 
here it will rage like it did in Seattle," 
he says, blue eyes flashing above a grin. 


Two days later, it raged. Thousands of ~ 
masked 
anarchists--our hoses among 
them, I imagine--showered police with 
sticks, petrol bombs, and cobblestones torn 
from the streetS. The riotlines shot back 
tear gas, stun grenades, and water can-
nons. Cops, youth, fire, 
blood, and 
tears flooded the streetS near the IMP 
and World Bank's conference center. 


The protests were the most violent an 
IMP meeting has ever seen, and they had 
the newswires squawking. 
"s,ooo protesters unleashed a fresh 
round of fury against economic global-
ization!" 
"6,ooo 
enemies 
of 
capitalism 
marched on the IMP and World Bank 
surnmir Tuesday!" 
And the like. The press numbered the 
crowd, gave it one name, and one inten-
tion. From what I saw, the labels were 
ill-suited and the intentions lacking. 


I saw my squat-mates just before the 
riots. Siv was extremely worked up. But 
not about cops, globalization, or even 
Hegel. "My trip at the moment," he 
said. "is that I have got to have a piss. 
Can you point me to the loo?" Later, 
Siv joined a peaceful march of samba 
musicians, decked out in pink, who 
marched to the Congress Center simply 
making noise. Serotonin ducked the vio-
lence as well. Using his video camera as 
a prop, he obtained an independent 
media press badge to help dodge arrest. 
He watched the bash of the year &om 
the sidelines and, with any luck, got it 
all on tape. 


Neither I nor my two comrades 
can say much about globalization, the 
IMP, or the World Bank. We were sim-
ply country-hopping bums, looking for 
a place to sleep and an event to join. 
We were not thugs, and we came to 
Prague in good faith. I came for a 
story. Serotonin for a party. Siv, for a 
piece of world history. I believe we 
fOund all three.
