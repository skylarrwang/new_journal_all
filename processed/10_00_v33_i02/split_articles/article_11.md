....... Oucation 
a warm Tuesday night in September, I am 
in the living room of an off-campus apart-
when two other Yale students walk in. One 
financial aid; the other does not receive aid. 
have come here, to a friendly apartment, to 
a bowl of marijuana and a two-liter bottle of 
NCWJ\alln Dew. As they pass the pipe and the soda

hadn't, but they don't seem too worried. 


If the police were to pass by our well-lit, first-
window and look inside, both my friends

my wealthier friend, these first-time charges 
probably lead at most to a fine and com-
service. But as a result of the HE.A amend-
other friend would stand to lose her 
~iving an education because of one 
for drug possession. Few students 
Yale know much about this Law, and 
of those who do don't see a rea-
to it. But a small group is 
that. 


1965 HF.A established categories 
aid like Stafford Loans and Pell 
"open the doors of college tO 
,. Every few years, Congress 
the Act, fixing interest rates 
adding new programs and ini-
the latest trends in educa-
1998, the amendments to the 
a provision introduced by 
Mark Souder (R-Ind.) Any 
of a drug-related offense 
would lose aU his or her federal financial aid for at least one year, 
perhaps permanently, depending on the severity of the crime, the 
number of offenses, and whether the student passed subsequent 
drug tests. This provision is retroactive, though juvenile offenses 
stricken from one's record do not count. Beginning in July 2000, 
the FAPSA form, which is used to determine students' eligibility for 
federal financial aid, included multiple-choice question 28, asking 
about an applicant's drug convictions. 


The American Civil Liberties Union soon launched a protest 
against the amendment. "Stop the Use of Student Aid as a Tool of 
Discrimination!" read the banner at the head of its November 4â€¢ 
1999, Action Akrt. This form letter, to be sent to a senator or repre-
sentative, points out the possible discriminatory effects of the pro-
vision, which mandates special penalties for the economically dis-
advantaged that do not apply to wealthier people convicted of 
identical crimes. The provision has racial implications as well: 
Eleven percent of u.s. drug users are African-American, yet they 
make up 37 percent of those arrested and 6o percent of those in 
state prisons for drug offenses, meaning the law would almost cer-
tainly affect students of color disproportionately. And the stipula-
tion that convicted students may complete a drug treatment pro-
gram to clear their records, the letter says, is a fig leaf which ignores 
the woeful shortage of slots in such programs. The letter urges one's 
elected official to support Senator Barney Frank's (o-Mass.) H.R. 
1053. which would repeal the amendment. 


With a year tO go before the law would take effect, the usual 
cadre of studenc activists coalesced around the cause last full. The 
nationwide Students for a Sensible Drug Policy, at their founding 
conference last October, "decided that this issue was really some-
thing winnable," says Alexandra Cox, a leader of Yale's Student 
Legal Action Movement (sLAM). At the conference, the group chose 
to push for a series of student council resolutions in protest of the 
provision. The resolution, co-authored by Cox and passed by the 
Yale College Council (ycc) in February 2000, is typical of those 
passed aU over the country at schools big and small, public and pri-
vate. It calls on Yale to "actively encourage" the passage of H.R. 1053

and to supplement any student's losses in financial aid. Hampshire 
College, in Amherst, MA, has actually established a fund for this 
purpose. With the only Ivy student council to sign on, Yale is fea-
tured prominently in a list of colleges and universities whose stu-
dents support H.R. 1053 on several drug-reform policy websites, such 
as raisryourvoice.com and drcnet.org, the Drug Reform Coalition's 
website. 


The Yale administration has yet to respond officially to the 
vee's call, but not because of a hardline position in the financial aid 
office against drug use or the possibility of compensating students 
for denied federal funding. "Personally, 
and I'm just expressing my own opin-
ion here, I am not at all opposed to 
adopting such a procedure [compensat-
ing students]," said Caesar Storlazzi, 
Associate 
Director of University 
Financial Aid. Storlazzi points out a 
historical precedent for the University's 
mitigating the effects of a law restrict-
ing federal aid. During the Vietnam 
War, the Federal Government denied 
aid to anyone who failed to register for 
the draft; in response, the University 
compensated conscientious objectors 
for lost funds.' "So it wouldn't be the 
first time we might make this kind of 
decision on principle," Storlazzi said. 


However, in this case, the princi-
ples involved are somewhat less clear 
than those surrounding the Vietnam 
War. After a long debate, for example, 
the Dwight Hall Cabinet decided to 
suppon only the first part of the YCC 
amendment, stopping short of recom-
mending that Yale give drug offenders 
extra money. Now SLAM is working not

to build consensus, but simply to raise awareness of the issue. 
"We're modeling ourselves after Students Against Sweatshops (sAS), 
which succeeded in bringing vast attention to something at school," 
Cox says. However, their campus organizing efforts have drawn 
only a handful of students thus far. While SAS has clearly defined 
targets, SLAM's goals are "more symbolic," says Cox, and its adver-
saries are more distant than the Yale administration or even 
Connecticut senators and representatives. In the absence of oppo-
sition on campus, they are focusing on education as a part of a 
national effort to put pressure on key legislators in other states who 
will vote on the pertinent legislation. 


Cox's choice of the word "symbol-
ic" points to larger reasons that this 
"really winnable" issue has failed to 
catch fire on campus. There is a not-so-
hidden sense among people who are 
excited about the HEA, on both sides, 
that it is really a gateway issue to a larg-
er, and much more volatile, debate 
about the War on Drugs. Drug-related 
offenses now constitute the only catego-
ty of crime for which students may be 
denied federal financial aid-not 
assault, not rape, not alcohol-related 
violations. So Students for a Sensible 
Drug Policy and the Drug Reform 
Coalition are leading the protests, while 
activists with more mainstream agendas 
are shying away. "I think on campus 
even some activists are reluctant to take 
this on because they don't think it's real-
ly legit," Cox says. Jelani Lawson, 
Director of A Better Way Foundation, 
which "educates and advocates on 
behalf of public-health-oriented solu-
tions to the War on Drugs," puts the
