MoST NEWS ACCOUNTS get it wrong: ~ 
Joseph Isador Lieberman is above all a man 
of many paradoxes. 

His speeches are long-winded and 
heavy with faces and figures. Confront him 
with an issue, however, and he will 
respond with poise and passion. His pres-
ence on camera is unimpressive, his per-
sonality mild; but when he speaks, people 
stop and pay attention. His voting record 
shows his willingness to spend millions on 
programs that help the poor, and billions 
on programs that help the powerful. He 
cites tikkun olam, the Jewish dictum mean-
ing "heal the world," as one of his most 
deeply-held beliefs, yet he has also voted 
for every u.s. military action from Panama 
and Grenada to the Persian Gulf (the last 
on a Saturday-the Sabbath-no less). He 
is known as "the conscience of the Senate" 
as well as something of a moralizer. He is a 
reserved, quiet person-a hard-working 
family man who still calls his mother at 
least once a day-but, at the same time, a 
tough and often ruthless politician who. 
knocks off seemingly unbeatable oppo-
nents before heading on to larger glories. 

The roots of the complexity that 
defines Lieberman took hold long before 
Yale. Lieberman spent the first 18 years of 
his life in a working-class neighborhood in 
Stamford, cr, living in a house bordered 
by a junkyard on one side and a tenement 
on the other. Much has been made of his 
modest roots and Orthodox Jewish 
upbringing. Lieberman himself praises his 
family and hometown for their role in his 
early political development-that is, his 
development into an American who cared 
"about the future of our democracy," as he 
writes in his recent memoir, In Praise of 
Public Lifo. Henry Lieberman was a liquor-
store owner who also held a part time job 
in a bakery, working 14-hour days to sup-
pon his wife Marcia and their three chil-
dren. The Liebermans kept an Orthodox 
borne, and their only son's young life was 
steeped in religiosity, a f.lct that has pro-
vided fodder for both his own political

rhetoric and extensive media coverage. Lieberman writes that his 
political interests come from that "same surprising portal of faith 
because it has much to do with the way I navigate through each day, 
personally and professionally." Long before he even applied to col-
lege, Joe Lieberman showed a penchant for the inner worlcings of 
politics. He staged his first political campaign while a freshman at 
Stamford High School, using 1950s rock songs in his speech and 
winning the race for class president by a landslide. He went on to 
hold the position for three of his four high school years, and was 
crowned prom king, a victory that he was unable to celebrate 
because the crowning was on a Saturday. In his valedictory speech, 
he spoke on civil rights and called on his classmates to join him in 
the fight against racism. 

Like so many events in his political career, Lieberman's arrival 
at Yale in 1960 was exquisitely timed. In the first half of the 1960s, 
Yale was changing from the fmishing school of the aristocracy that 
former chaplain William Sloane Coffin describes as "the bland lead-
ing the bland" to a hotbed of liberal activism and dissent. (By 1967, 
Yale had the largest number of students who had turned their drafr 
cards over to the Justice Department ro protest the Vietnam War.) 
In 196o, when Joe Lieberman's freshman class entered Yale, it drew 
over 6o percent of its students from East Coast prep schools. At the 
start of his senior year, for the first time in Yale's history, more than 
half of incoming freshmen came from public schools, and minority 
representation was slowly growing. Along with this shifr in demo-
graphics, the University's leaderslllp was changing. After A. 
Whitney Griswold died in 1962, Kingman Brewster rook over as 
President and began an ambitious effort to break down the blue-
blood esublishment and recast Yale as a meritocracy. Reverend 
Coffin was one of the nation's most vocal and visible civil rights 
activists and later spearheaded the anti-war movement. T he first 
traces of social upheaval and liberal activism were appearing in 
every f:acet of University life. "Everyone felt things changing," 
recalls Jethro Lieberman, a friend (but no relation) of the Senator's 
who worked with him on the N~s and was tapped into the same 
secret society, Elihu. "We were really the Kennedy generation-the 
sense that we had to move forward was in the air." And the young 
Joe Lieberman was very much at the vanguard of this charge. 

In the days before student government and the bevy of under-
graduate publications that now overwhelm the campus, the News 
was the undeniable center of political power at Yale. (Among 
Lieberman's associates on the N~s were former presidential adviser 
and U.S. N~s & World Report editor David Gergen, famed activist 
lawyer Stephen Bingham, and Bob Kaiser and Paul Steiger, manag-
ing editors of The Washington Post and The Wall Strut journal, 
respectively.) Despite his interest and political ambition, Lieberman 
did not join the N~s staff until his sophomore year. Once he had, 
though, his rise to the top position was meteoric. In November of 
1962, during the fall of his junior year, Lieberman was elected 
Chairman, the equivalent of today's Editor-in-Chief, a position 
normally reserved for those who had worked on the paper since the 
first days of freshman year. "He joined the News late, which is inter-
esting, but we never doubted he would be Chairman," explains 
Jethro, Managing Editor under the more prominent Lieberman. 
"He was an extremely adept politician in the best sense of the 
word-a person capable of putting together coalitions of which he 
was the leader." 

Once Chairman, Lieberman moved seamlessly between the 
roles of politician and moral crusader. Under him, the N~s reflect-
ed the growing liberalism and social consciousness of a campus stiU 
dominated by prep schoolers. According to Coffin, "[The News] 
was picking up an ethical theme and the main issue was civil 
rights." The Chairman's most visible role was writing editorials. 
Lieberman's prominent position and gregarious personality brought 
him imo the public light and made his one of the most powerful 
voices on campus. His frequent editorials dripped with liberal ide-
alism and moral certainty. "Being Chairman was important, and we 
thought it was a time when you could make a difference," recounts 
Harvey Berenson, Business Manager of the News during 
Lieberman's tenure. "With Kennedy, people believed you could do 
good works and save the world. It wasn't as cynical as it is now." 

Indeed, the young President's hope and charisma-not to 
mention that he was the first non-Protestant President-had no 
small effect on Joe Lieberman. Inspired by the infectious sense of 
change in the air, Lieberman went to Washington briefly during the 
Kennedy administration, spending the summer after his junior year 
as an intern in the office of liberal Connecticut Senator Abraham 
Ribicoff (the first Jew elected to the Senate). His editorial the week 
after Kennedy's assassination, entitled "A Void," was the earnest and 
heart-broken lament of a young idealist: "He renewed our faith; he 
extended our vision of what was possible .... He embodied our 
dreams and now-with no forewarning-he is gone." Lieberman 
did not only write about civil rights issues. He was the first Yale stu-
dent to write in f:avor of co-education, defended Alabama Governor

George Wallace's right to speak on campus (which was nonetheless 
denied), and ran editorials criticizing secret societies and the Old 
Yale elitism that they represented. (Though Lieberman would later 
join a society, Elihu, there are rumors that he turned down mem-
bership in the most exclusive of them -:all: Skull and Bones.) 

Throughout, Lieberman managed to avoid coming across as an 
overly pedantic scold. In fact, his final editorial did not wax elo-
quent on injustice or invoke Talmud. In it, he questioned whether 
he and his associates hadn't taken themselves too seriously. One 
appeared in the editorial section shortly after the volunteers 
returned to New Haven. The Nnus' coverage reflected the deeply 
moralistic idealism of the day and was also rather self-congratulato-
ry. Bingham wrote that "Yale University has a truly extraordinary 
record of giving of itself," while an editorial note called the response 
of Yalies "a most significant indication of the awakening of Yale," 
and wished the volunteers "Godspeed in their journey and service."

classmate, 
Angus 
Macbeth, 
calls 
Lieberman "sardonically humorous," 
pointing to his membership in the 
Pundits, a notoriously irreverent senior 
prankster society. And though he planted 
himself firmly within the mainstream, 
avoiding the showy label of "radical," his 
pieces were often gutsy. In October of 
1963, he wrote and published on the front 
page "An Open Letter to Yale Alumni," 
criticizing them for their complacency on 
civil rights and calling on them "to use

relieved him of all obligation to attend 
classes for the entirety of senior year and 
required only a thesis before graduation.

its day almost as much as Old Blue-the

their influence in the power structure, the business complex-to 
bring about constructive and responsible change." 

That same month, Allard Lowenstein visited Yale on behalf of 
the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to recruit 
volunteers for the Freedom Vote Project. The basic idea was to have 
fieldworkers direct a mock gubernatorial election among 
Mississippi's black population. Blacks would be asked to vote-not 
in the regular election, to which their access was restricted by Jim 
Crow, but in a parallel "Freedom Vote" d~igned to minimize the 
potential for violence, and thereby ensure maximum voter turnout. 
Joe Lieberman was an obvious choice for the trip. Coffin remem-
bers, "He had fine ethical instincts and he was concerned about civil 
rights .... I urged him to go and wanted very much for him to go." 

Thirty Yalies, Lieberman among them, responded to Lowenstein's 
call and began heading south at the end of October, staying through 
the November 4 conclusion of the campaign, at which point some 
8o,ooo votes had been cast. The presence of white college students 
sometimes served to draw attention away from the conditions that 
bad brought them there in the first place. Th~ Nnu Yclrk Timn sene

news that Yale students were working "for a Negro gubernatorial 
candidate in Mississippi." During the Freedom Rally in Jackson, 
which concluded the campaign, 1V men from NBC spent most of 
their time shooting film ofYalies and hardly seemed aware oflocals 
and full-time SNCC workers. SNCC was, for the most part, fine with 
this: As one staffer put it, "It was clear that the press would respond 
to the beating of a Yale student as it simply would not do to the 
~ring of a local Negro." 

So was it all do-goodism? While Lieberman was off in 
Mississippi, reports from the from-line dominated the front page of 
his newspaper. Besides "Why I go to Mississippi, .. a description of 
lbe campaign by Stephen Bingham entitled "Mississippi and You,.

John Bailey was to politics what 
Vince Lombardi was to football: For him, the point of the game was 
to win, sometimes at any cost. Bailey was an old-school "boss" in 
every sense of the word. In In Prais~ of Public Lifo, Lieberman wrote 
that Bailey's machinations reminded him of Willie Stark, the auto-
cratic governor from Robert Penn Warren's Ali th~ King's Mm: "I 
can make the mare go," Stark tells a reporter in the novel. Bailey 
brought to power a considerable number of figures both in 
Connecticut and on the national level-including his friend John F. 
Kennedy, whom be successfully maneuvered into the Democratic 
nomination in 196o--and was instrumental in keeping Democrats 
in control of state government for most of the 1950s, 1960s, and 
1970s. Bailey twisted arms and cursed and threatened and played 
dirty when dirty was needed. T heodore White, in his 1960 book 
Th~ Making of th~ Pr~sidmt, wrote that "Bailey had in his fourteen 
years in office in Connecticut built the tightest New England polit-
ical machine which he operated with merciless efficiency." Bailey's 
tactics would make a surprisingly deep impression on Lieberman, 
the professed champion of good works and tikkun olam. The mas-
ter of back-room, hard-knuckled policies, as Lieberman once wrote, 
"was not totally evil, but then again he was not a philosopher king 
either." Lieberman's apprenticeship with Bailey was more than a bit 
at odds with the spirit of Mississippi, but invaluable nevertheless. 
Bailey was Later labeled "the young Joe Lieberman's political rabbi." 
After Lieberman chose to make Bailey the subject of his senior 
thesis, he submerged himself in histories of Connecticut politics 
and shadowed the man himself day and night. "It was a fascina-
tion," recalls Jethro Lieberman. He conducted countless interviews, 
tagged along to legislative meetings, even sat in on important bro-
kering sessions between Local ward bosses and constituents. In 
doing so, of course, he had more than mere commencement prizes 
in mind; "I could see that there was no better way to learn about 
the history and intricacies of Connecticut's government than to
