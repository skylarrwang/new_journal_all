Eyes on the Prize 
THE PERENNIAL FILING 
frenzy that descends 
on the fellowship 
office 
at 
Undergraduate 
Career Services 
during the first 
weeks 
of 
September 
has 
finally 
calmed. 


Legions of Yalies 
brandishing appli-
cations and wearied 
from weeks of hum-
ble 
self-aggrandize-
ment have given up 
their annual siege of 1 
Hillhouse Ave. The many 
seniors who just couldn't 
get that perfect Rhodes 
recommendation or whose 
Fulbright 
interview 
flopped are now left to 
look for real jobs or to seek 
funds elsewhere. 


Yet the despair of these 
haggard souls is unwarrant-
ed. They need look no further 
than the Yale College Dean's 
Office 
website 
to 
find 
Undergraduate Prius, a cata-
logue of Yale's many endowed 
prizes-some offering hun-
dreds, even thousands, of 
dollars. The Dean's Office, 
the Council of Masters, and 
the residential colleges grant 
prizes for good sportsmanship, 
good grades, and even some for 
good intentions. The John C. 
Shroeder Award is set aside for 
the junior "who, in the opinion 
of the Committee on Award, 
will find his/her 
place and play a 
good part in 
the good labor 
of the world." 


Other prizes, however, ask for 
something 
more. 


Looking closely, the 
Yalie with even the 
most arcane talent, 
the most obscure 
interests, and the 
most eccentric char-
acter traits can find 
the trailhead of his or 
her own road to riches 
in Undergraduate Prius. 


Take, for instance, the F. 
Wilder 
Bellamy, 
Jr., 
Memorial award, "for the 
junior or juniors who best 
exemplify the 'qualities for 
which F. Wilder Bellamy, Jr., 
is remembered."' Just what are. 
these qualities? The Class 
Book of 1937 yields some 
answers. 


Mr. 
Bellamy 
("Babe" to his college chums) 
attended St. Mark's prep 
school and entered Yale as a 
legacy in 1933. He lived in 
Davenport, managed rwo varsi-
ry sports teams, majored in 
American History, and left plan-
ning to become an "investment 
broker." For sure, not just any-
one can live up to such achieve-
ments. One of seven juniors 
who took home $2,000 for the 
Bellamy prize last year, David 
Valdez (oc 'ox) acknowledged 
that he and Mr. Bellamy "share a 
certain mystique." Asked whether 
he plans to become an investment 
broker, Mr. Valdez (who has no 
quirky nickname) replied, "No, no 
brokerage 
business 
for 
me. 
Entertainment. It's only a lit-
tle different." 


Among the 
prizes that take 
more 
fore-
thought 
is 
Library Map Prize, "awarded by the 
Universiry Library to the student who 
makes the best use of maps in his/her 
senior essay or its equivalent." Fred Musto, 
curator of maps at Sterling Memorial 
Library, takes his duties as judge seriously. 
"I don't know what sort of humor you're 
going to find in the Map Prize," he warns 
before I begin my questioning. The Prize, 
he goes on to explain, usually goes to a stu-
dent whose thesis involves historical geog-
raphy or architecture. But it is not awarded 
every year, so spurious prize seekers need 
not apply. "We know that some people just 
look at the prize list to see what they're eli-
gible for," Musto scowls. 


Another man keeping a watchful eye 
on the Â·prize he oversees is Beinecke 
Library's Stephen Parks. Mr. Parks's eyes 
shine with nostalgia as he tells me about 
the award's namesake Adrian van Sinderen, 
"one of the grand old book collectors of his 
era." The prize, $500 for sophomores and 
$750 for seniors, was endowed by Mr. van 
Sinderen "to stimulate book collecting 
among undergraduates, to encourage 
book-buying, book-owning, and book-
reading both as a hobby and as a funda-
mental part of the educational process." 


Mr. Parks explains that the committee of 
judges looks not simply for rariry, but 
rather for the "intelligently chosen nucleus" 
of a personal library. Winning collections 
have included editions of the Wizard of Oz 
and books on beekeeping. "Of course, 
there's always somebody who tries to win 
by submitting his course books," Mr. Parks 
commented derisively. 


The residential college prizes honor 
perhaps the most carefree set of achieve-
ments. The Berkeley College Fellows Prize, 
for instance, is set aside for "that member 
who has brought the most light and air to 
the College." Some students feel, however, 
that certain prizes demand the impossible. 


The Lawton Calhoun Cup is awarded 
annually in Pierson College "to that mem-
ber of the college who, in the opinion of 
the Master, has done the most to make 
Pierson a happy place." Says Pierson neigh-
bor Jack Snyder (oc '03), "Bring happiness 
to Pierson? A Sisyphean challenge, indeed." 


Don't feel up to the task? Perhaps, in 
the end, a real job doesn't look so bad.
