then went on: "Naw, it's even older. Oil is 
as old as the dinosaurs." His statement was 
bold, but I wasn't impressed. I soon would 
be, though. Stephen was just getting 
warmed up. 


His sales pitch was forceful, a winged 
barrage of fact and apparent fiction. By the 
end of it, I would be exhausted. He began 
with a geography lesson, explaining that 
"most oil comes from Europe---countries 
like France, Africa and Saudi Arabia." He 
followed with a passionate one-liner: "My 
products are from right here." He had sup-
pliers in New York who got him the "stuff" 
he needed to make his oils. This frightened 
me. I really didn't want to douse my naked 
body in anything from the big city. So 
I asked a simple question: "What's 
in your oils?" 
He told me that his oils 
come from both plants and 
animals. When I pressed 
him to clarify, he obliged: 
"See, some of my oils come 
from rotting wood extracts. 
Some come from animals 
like ... like ... whales." 
When 
he 
finished 
frowned and reluctantly cor-
rected himself: "Well, not 
whales. Their oil is used for 
burning. I guess I can't really think of any 
animals I use." 
I tried to ease his obvious discomfort 
with another question: "How do you get 
your oils?" I knew that Stephen had "sup-
pliers" in the city, but then again so do hos-
pitals and addicts. I wanted more informa-
tion. But Stephen had clearly pegged me as 
a dangerous outsider. He responded cryp-
tically: "My suppliers usually just UPS the 
stuff to me." Silence followed. 


Our conversation resumed after an 
uncomfortable minute of quiet. It was time 
to do business, and Stephen was ready for 
battle. I began by asking him what his most 
popular oil was. He hurled a quick 
response, no hesitation: "My best scent ever 
was 'Back That Ass Up'-you know, like 
that popular song. Yeah, that one sold like 
hotcakes." 


With this remark Stephen launched 
into a rapid-fire explanation of his market-
ing strategy. His insides were exposed for 
the first time. "I don't have a logo or any-
thing. But what I do is mix the oils and 
then give them unique names." He stopped 
abruptly. My jaw dropped open. What was 
this? He had spoken freely and obviously 
thought he had gone too far. I was too curi-
ous; I was the competition, a potential oil 
kingpin who would seize the market with 
all my Iowa cunning. We had been making 
progress, and now it had all just fallen 
apart. It was my cue to leave. I tried to 
seem inclifferent as I departed, allowing just 
a hint of interest to taint my goodbye. I 
waved and walked. Stephen just 
stood there. 


I wasn't going to go 
back, but I 
had 
to. 
Stephen and I were con-
nected. We were star-
crossed lovers without 
the love, man and mer-
chant. I missed him; he 
missed me. I was corn. I 
returned to the street cor-
ner three days later, 
clutching a fistful of dol-
lar bills. Stephen was 
waiting. I wasted no time: "I want 
some oil. Something raw, something 
classy." He sized me up as if to decide what 
oil would best complement my Iowa scent. 
He declared that I needed something 
"earthy" and handed me several bottles, 
among them a container of "Amber" and a 
vial of "Big Pappa." I chose "Ferdous." 
Stephen told me that the word meant 
"highest heaven" or "paradise" in Arabic. It 
smelled like fruit and after-shave; its poten-
tial was jnfinjce. 


We made the exchange, money for oil, 
and I walked away, hopeful. In my hand I 
clutched paradise in a vial. T he buy was a 
religious experience. Stephen was a little 
richer and I reeked of potential-oily, 
odorous, filmy potential-that sloshed in a 
two-dollar bottle.
