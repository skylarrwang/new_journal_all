"study John Bailey," he wrote in In Praise of 
Public Lifo. "The hours I spent interview-
ing him were priceless, my own private 
course in political science." Lieberman 
repaid his debt handsomely, portraying 
Bailey in his thesis as a brilliant, cunning, 
and magnanimous leader who understood 
both that the political game was changing 
and how to win it. The admiring thesis--
part biography, part machine political phi-
losophy-was published as The Power 
Broker by Houghton Mifflin in 1966, while 
Lieberman was still in law school. (It 
remains the authoritative biography on 
Bailey to this day.) After graduation, 
Lieberman sp~nt the summer of 1964 
working for Bailey in Washington during 
his tenure as chairman of the National 
Democratic Parry. 

But in pledging himself to Bailey, 
Lieberman may have taken the first steps 
on a path that, as many of his critics claim 
today, seems to run counter to the course 
he had set for himself-both in his work 
with Senator Abraham Ribicoff the sum-
mer before his senior year and with the 
News as an idealistic crusader. To his early 
faith in the good, Lieberman added a new 
faith in the joys of victory. As Boss Bailey 
himself was fond of saying, "You've gotta 
do what you've gorta do." 

Lieberman learned all this and never 
forgot it. If he sensed a contradiction in 
exhorting his classmates to heal the world 
while admiring and evenrually incorporat-
ing the ethic of}ohn Bailey, he seems not to 
have agonized over it too much. It was only 
by sheer chance that the Connecticut polit-
ical machine came into the Senator's life so 
quickly on the heels of Mississippi. Bur 
here emerged the two sides of Joe 
Lieberman's political life-the desire to do 
right and the desire tO win. 

SHORTLY AFTER GRADUATING &om Yale 
Law School in 1967, the pupil was ready to 
apply the lesson. In 1970, Lieberman was 
27 and practicing law in the area when 
New Haven's State Senator Ed Marcus 
announced 
his 
candidacy 
for 
the 
Democratic parry's u.s. Senate nomination. 
Lieberman saw his opportuniry and 
entered his bid to replace Marcus as State 
Senator. After Marcus failed to win the 
nomination, a State Senate race futile in

the eyes of party insiders, between the 
recent graduate and the seasoned Senator, 
was on. But it was Marcus who would end 
up surprised. Employing Bailey's first rule 
of political success-organization, organi-
zation, organization-Lieberman enlisted a 
cadre of young volunteers, among them , 
Bill Clinton, then a law student at Yale. 
Lieberman mounted a relentless door-to-
door campaign and secured the voce of a 
vital constituency-Yale students who were 
allowed to vote in local elections for the 
first time that year. On Election Day, he 
shocked the Marcus campaign by rounding 
up senior citizens from a nearby retirement 
home and bringing them co vote in vans 
and station wagons. Lieberman went on to 
win the primary by 240 votes and, after 
that, the general election, remaining New 
Haven's State Senator for ten years and 
majority leader for the last six. 

In 1980, Lieberman ditched the State 
Senate and ran for the u.s. House of 
Representatives, but lost to a Republican 
opponent after watching a 17-point lead 
dwindle down to nothing in the final weeks 
of the campaign. Two years later, he 
returned to the scene a new man. With a 
political acumen that would have made 
Boss Bailey proud, he positioned himself as 
a man of the center, a maverick of the 
mainstream unafraid to buck party lines for 
what was right (or what would win), and 
emerged victorious as the new Connecticut 
Attorney General. While in office, he 
revived what had once been little more 
than a political sinecure into a showcase for 
high-profile prosecutions and investiga-
tions, gaining a reputation as a tireless pub-
lic advocate. From the Attorney General's 
office there was but one obvious destina-
tion to seek out next: Washington, the seat 
of power to which he had been denied 
access eight years earlier. Lieberman target-
ed Senator Lowell Weicker. And though 
Weicker was a Republican, Lieberman ran 
to his right, alleging that the Senator was 
out of touch with his constituency and 
using his office for financial gain. Still, he 
trailed for most of the race--that is, until 
he ran a now-legendary cartoon ad likening 
Weicker to a sleeping bear. The cartoon 
opens with a trail of "Zu:z:r.s" drifting from 
the entrance of a bear cave, and an over-
lizcd bear cozily sleeping through the roll

call vote. "On things that matter to him 
personally, he will always growl," says the 
narrator, "but sometimes when it matters, 
he is sleeping." Lieberman won the elec-
tion, but only by a mere IO,ooo votes. 

THERE MAY BE NO INDUSTRY in which One's 
heart and one's ambitions so frequendy col-
lide as they do in politics. Joe Lieberman, 
perhaps more than any other politician of 
his time, has tiptoed without visible effort 
along the fine line between selflessness and 
self-advancement. He has won four pri-
maries and nine elections--five in a row for 
the State Senate starting in 1970, two for 
State Attorney General in 1982 and 1986, 
and finally two more for the u.s. Senate in 
1988 and 1994-and lost only once. He has 
knocked off seemingly invincible oppo-
nents and-with the exception of only one 
or two small controversies--emerged from 
the fray with no visible mud on his suit and 
the Democratic nomination for Vice 
President to show for it. 

Many characters from Joe Lieberman's 
early days as an idealist and moral 
spokesman express quiet reservations about 
developments in his political life, such as 
his decision to run for Vice President and 
Senator concurrently rather than give up 
his seat to another Democrat. "The one 
thing I regret today is that Joe is not a con-
servative Jew and an orthodox Democrat-
they are a dying breed," said Coffin. Still, 
the Joe Lieberman of today, shrewd politi-
cian and "moral voice of the Senate," is to 
them not radically changed from the young 
idealist who published "Why I Go to 
Mississippi" in October of 1963. Joe 
Lieberman's days at Yale and the brilliant 
career to which they gave way bring into 
light a knot of complications. It was here 
that "the Senator" learned how public goals 
tangle with private intentions--and exactly 
how to exploit this complexity.
