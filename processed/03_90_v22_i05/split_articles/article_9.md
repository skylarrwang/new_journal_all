On the first floor of the Yale Un!versity 
Art Gallery, a small crowd peers at a 
framed blueprint of the building. 
Despite an array of architectural 
sketches, models, and photographs of 
museum designs, many visitors come 
to see the gallery itself. "This is an 
exhibit in which the building is on 
exhibition," said Patricia Cummings 
Loud, author of the current show 
catalogue. Until March 11, YUAG 
will feature the work of Louis I. 
Kahn , 
professor of archi-
tecture from 1947 to 
1957. The 
exhibit coincides with an effort by the 
museum's new management to restore 
the distinctive features Kahn designed 
for the gallery. 

Kahn drafted plans for an addition 
to the art gallery in 1951. On a campus 
noted for buildings in the Collegiate 
Gothic tradition, the expansion was 
the first modem structure at Yale. 
Kahn preferred concrete to marble and 
steel girding to Corinthian columns. 
"Most of the people on the architecture 
staff were modernists and felt that Yale 
should be making a statement in sup-
port of modern art," said Anthony 
Hirschel, assistant to the director of the 
Yale Art Gallery. 

Kahn's design emphasized both 
aesthetic qualities and functional 
elements. He created a system of 
movable walls on springs called "pogo 
panels," which allowed exhibition 
designers to alter room configurations. 
He ran a large concrete shaft through 
all 
the floors of the building, 
unashamedly exposing the workings of 
the museum. Designed to encase the 
stairwell, the 
shaft also houses 
plumbing and electrical fixtures. Low 
ceilings create an unimposing mood 
rare to most museums. "Kahn was 
concerned that the space provide an 
intimate and domestic sense. That way 
the works of art do better," Hirschel 
said . 

But in the 1950s, YUAG directors 
wanted their gallery to resemble the 
Museum of Modern Art in New York. 
They ordered renovations which 
obscured some of Kahn's intended 


effects. Workers constructed semi-
permanent walls for additional 
hanging space; many were light in 
color like those in the MOMA. This 
color scheme violated Kahn's belief 
that art should be d isplayed against 
dark backgrounds. 

Today, YUAG administrators are 
trying to restore many of Kahn's 
touches. Hidden by partitions installed 
during the '50s, the concrete shaft and 
vestibule will soon be visible. Pogo 
panels will reappear in the museum's 
European collection this spring. 

Organized by the Duke University 
Museum of Art, the exhibition will 
continue on to its final destination at 
the Museum of Modern Art in San Fran-
cisco. Not coinc.identally, Duke and San 
Francisco are considering plans for 
new museums, structures which they 
hope to model after Kahn's work. 

" People have been continually 
interested in Kahn since he built this 
m useum," said Hirschel. "His 
museums offer the ideal setting for 
presenting works of art."
