"It's like there's some mysterious force 
that's afraid to hear what we have to 
say," Bryson said. 

YSL members struggle to be heard. 
They try to appear at any event which 
addresses abortion, 
where 
they 
distribute leaflets elaborating their 
position. "We want students to be 
aware that there are students who are 
pro-life, and hopefully force them to 
seriously reevaluate their opinions on 
abortion," said Bryson. While Mooney 
doubts whether even he can convert 
"hard-core pro-choicers," he maintains 
that protests are vital. "It's a matter of 
shaking everyone up a little, and 
pointing out that it's not a closed case 
at all." 

Pro-choice feminists on campus 
believe the case is clear, and that there 
is no question about the right to 
abortion. Alex Lutz (SY '91), a 
member of SOS, said that feminism 
and a pro-life position are mutually 
exclusive. Women for Life, a subgroup 
of YSL, formed last spring to discuss 
the relationship between feminism and 
the anti-abortion position. Between 
four and six women attend each meet-
ing. "We're interested in looking at the 
pro-life 
issue 
from 
a 
woman's 
perspective," said Brady. "Can you be 
a feminist, a liberated woman, main-
tain some sense of privacy, and still be 
pro-life?" Habeck said Women for Life 
accepts the feminist agenda, with the 
exception of the pro-choice stance. 

Lutz doesn't find the Women for Life 
position valid. "Being a feminist is 
about women having a choice," she 
said. 

Brady claims that views like Lutz's 
hinder YSL's efforts to find support. "I 
think that after a couple of years at this 
place, you really start incorporating 
Yale's liberal attitudes into what you 
think." Many people may arrive here 
opposing abortion, she said, but end 
up joining the pro-choice movement. 

Meanwhile, Bryson keeps talking, 
confident that her message is reaching 
someone.
