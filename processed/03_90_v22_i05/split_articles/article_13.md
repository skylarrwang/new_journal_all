"Some nights I stare at 
my econ book and all 
I see are two goal 
posts." 
everyday." The public generally credits 
a Yalie's outstanding performance in 
the Ivy League not to his ability but to 
the inability of his opponents, Peterson 
said. Ed Perks (BK '92), the top kicker 
on the footall team, added, "You could 
be a great back in the league, but you 
are a great J:>ack in the Ivy League." 
As a kicker, Perks is not held back 
by the level of competition here. His Â· 
skill is assessed solely by numbers. 
After all, a 45-yard field goal travels 45 
yards, regardless of where it's kicked. 
While the University of Arkansas 
offered Perks a "full ride," he felt 
choosing Yale would not hurt his 
chances of going pro. 
Like kicking, pitching talent can be 
easily measured. Yale Baseball Coach 
Joe Benanto calls a pitcher's skill "time-
divisioned" because scouts rely on 
radar guns and stop watches to gauge 
it. A pitcher throwing with great 
velocity at Yale should be able to do so 
anywhere regardless of the competi-
tion. "It doesn't matter who you are 
throwing against," said Benanto. "All 
stop watches tell the same story." 
When Ron Darling came out of high 
school, the stop watches said he could 
throw a baseball over 85 miles per 
hour. Darling, who now pitches for the 
New York Mets, attracted national 
attention as a Yale pitcher from 1979 
to 1981. Sports Illustrated described him as 
an "athletic miraculist extant." "Ronnie 
got as much attention as anyone in the 
country from the minute he got here," 
said Benanto. In 1981, Darling led the 
Bulldogs 
to their most successful 
season since 1948, when their captain 
was George 
Bush. Still, Darling 
needed to prove his mettle against the 
top hitters in the nation and played in 
the Cape Cod Summer League in the 
off-season. 
Like Darling, Dudley had to prove 
his abilities in non-Ivy competition. 
He finished his last season at Yale as 
the second leading rebounder in the 
country. Such an accomplished player 
should have been chosen early in the 
first round of the NBA college draft. 
Dudley was choice number 75. With 
only Ivy credentials, Dudley struggled 
to convince scouts that he was pro 
material. "It was important for me to 
go to All-Star camps," said Dudley, "so 
scouts could see what I could do 
against big-time college players." 
Coaches liked what they saw at the 
camps and decided to give him a 
chance. Dudley was drafted by the 
Cavaliers and has since been shipped 
to the New Jersey Nets. 
While Dudley began considering an 
NBA career in his sophomore year, 
academic obligations competed with 
his professional aspirations. The Yale 
athlete, like all undergraduates, must 
read poetry, complete problem sets 
and attend the language lab. The need 
to accomodate class schedules frus-
trates coaches. 
During practice, 
Benanto, 
long accustomed 
to 
intellectual incursions on the field, 
pines for "a captivated audience." In 
order for 
Basketball Coach Dick 
Kuchen to get a full team to practice 
on Thursdays last semester, he was 
forced to schedule a 7 to 9 a.m. 
pre-class workout. "When four kids 
have section on the same afternoon, we 
have to improvise," said Kuchen. "It's 
frustrating as a coach, but coaches in 
this department realize why men and 
women come to Yale." 


Annoying for coaches, this juggling 
act is outright nerveracking for 
players. "When I'm stressed about 
school, I don't play well," said Casey 
Cammann (DC '92), the center for the 
basketball team. "I have a hard time 
shifting gears." By the same token, 
Perks sometimes has trouble working 
because he would rather be kicking the 
points. "Some nights I stare at my econ 
book and all I see are two goal posts." 


Like everybody else, athletes must 
make sacrifices, although sometimes 
the extent of their self-denial seems 
more extreme. Peterson doesn't hit 
Toad's with his teammates for Friday 
night happy hours because, he said, 
"any free time I have when I'm not 
studying 
needs to 
be used for 
basketball." 
When Paul Maley (ES '88) went to 
the prestigious Portsmouth Invitation-
al Basketball Tournament, he took his 
homework. The tournament attracted 
all the best college players in the 
nation. To Maley's delight, he roomed 
with Georgia Tech's Craig "Noodles" 
Neal, a renowned passer and point 
guard. 
Although Maley's on-court 
dexterity impressed scouts and earned 
him an NBA tryout, Noodles remem-
bers Maley holed up in his room each 
night, working on his senior essay. It 
was spring break, after all, and NBA 
or no NBA, Maley's essay could not 
wait. "I never thought I'd hear the end 
of it," Maley said. 
Despite 
the burdens, 
a 
Yale 
education may actually help athletes 
into the pros. "We look at mental 
makeup and what kind of toughness a 
guy has inside," said Roland Johnson, 
director of scouting for the New York 
Mets. "The Ivy Leaguer might be 
assumed to be more intelligent." Don 
Martin (SM '71), a former professional 
football 
player, 
agreed that Yale 
athletes have a reputation for being 
level-headed. ''How many drug-
addicted Ivy Leaguers have you seen 
in the news lately?" 
Though Yale may not crank out 
Divison I supermen, some coaches and 
scouts do not see this as a drawback. 
"We are a little behind, maybe as many 
as 70 to 80 practices," said Cozza, "but 
our guys aren't burned out after 
college." At big college programs, the 
athlete might peak while still in school 
and not improve at the professional 
level. "The less experience an athlete 
has, the better he might get," Johnson 
said. 
Once a Yalie goes pro, everybody 
wants to talk about where he went to 
school. Darling has rarely appeared on 
nationwide TV without broadcasters 
prefacing his name with the words 
"Yale graduate." (Actually, Darling 
never graduated from Yale, leaving 
after his junior year to begin his pro 
career.) "It's real good for a team's 
image," said Coach Kuchen, "because 
there's a huge media interest in a guy 
who does both things." 
In the pros, Yalies, to nobody's 
surprise, are tagged as intellectuals. 
While traveling with the New Jersey 
Nets during the months preceding the 
1989-90 season, Maley found himself 
so stereotyped. On the bus one day, 
the Nets' Coach Bill Fitch and one of 
the other players were arguing about 
the date of "some war" when they 
caught a glimpse of Maley curled up 
with a historical novel. "I was saying, 
'God, I hope they don't ask me,'" 
Maley said. "I hadn't the foggiest when 
it was." Sure enough, the coach turned 
to Maley. "Why don't we ask the Yale 
guy?" he said, and would not accept 
Maley's claims of ignorance. "He said 
'Gosh, you know when a history major 
from Yale doesn't know, we're in real 
trouble,"' Maley said. 
Most Yale graduates in the pros 
have had similar experiences, but, said 
Maley, "it's never malicious." Don 
Martin may feel differently. When 
Martin joined the Oakland Raiders in 
1971, Gene Upshaw, now head of the 
Player's Association and Art Shell, 
current coach of the Raiders, made 
their new teammate sing the Bulldog 
song before he could start his 
professional career. Chris Dudley has 
to put up with such teasing all the time. 
Fans have christened the missed 
freethrow a "Dud" in his honor.
