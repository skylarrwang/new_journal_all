Memories 
Black-] ewish 
relations are 
like 
gremlins: they are only mentioned when 
something goes wrong. Only when an 
African-American speaker who is 
allegedly anti-Semitic comes to campus 
do we suddenly hear concern over 
"black-J ewish relations." Such concern 
has recently centered on the Nation of 
Islam here at Yale, Public Enemy at 
Columbia University, and Jesse 
Jackson on the national level. Abdul 
Alim Muhammad's speech last month 
aroused profound feelings of anger and 
fear in both peoples. At the Law 
School, Jewish protesters crowded the 
halls, and African Americans, proud of 
the speaker, packed the auditorium. 
Why? 
We should begin by realizing that 
Jews and African Americans do not 
interact today as communities. 
National Jewish and African-
American leaders are not occupied 
with reciprocal diplomacy. On our 
own campus, Hillel and the African-
American Cultural Center have no 
ongoing interaction. Instead, relations 
between the two communities- what-

clearly so. Consider a controversial 
remark made by Muhammad in his 
~ speech at Yale last month. In reference 
~ to accusations that South African 
!t Jewish doctors had iniected black

"J 
• infants with AIDS, Muhammad said 
~ the story could be true. It seems that 
~ Muhammad's intention was simply to 
.., indicate the extent and inhumanity of 
~ white supremacy in the world. Indeed, 
ever they 
may be- and 
between 
individual J ews and African Ameri-
cans are dominated by the white-black 
dynamic. 
Interaction between the 
average J ew and African American is 
informed first and foremost by the 
prejudices, · fears, 
misg1vmgs and 
curiosities that exist between whites 
and blacks who make only superficial 
contact and know little about each 
other. 
There are specific feelings and 
prejudices, however, which many Jews 
hold about African Americans, and the 
reverse is also true. Though these 
feelings and• prejudices generally 
remain quietly in check, they erupt 
when someone 
Abdul Alim 
Muhammad comes to speak. Again, 
we must ask why. 
Some J ews claim that anti-Semitism 
is particularly virulent in the African-
American community. These alle-
gations usually 
refer 
to 
African-
American leaders making statements 
which have anti-Semitic overtones, but 
some of these statements, 
while 
pupportedly anti-Semitic, are not 
He recalled the Tuskegee case of white 
American doctors injecting African· 
American babies with syphilis. To 
African-American ears, as to non· 
Jewish ears in general, Muhammad's 
statement is a moving commentary on 
white oppression. But to J ewish ears, 
his statement echoes a long line of anti· 
Semitic 
incitements 
whiCh 
have 
sparked pogroms and massacres of 
Jews throughout European history. In 
our own 
parents' lifetime, 
Stalin 
fabricated the infamous "Doctors Plot,' 
m 
which 
the 
Soviet government 
accused six Jewish doctors 
of 
assassinating two Soviet leaders and 
conspiring to murder more. Jews 
today cannot help but be shaken to the 
core by statements like M uhammad's. 
Nevertheless, it is debatable whether 
Muhammad's words were intentionally 
anti-Semitic, or simply a description of 
white oppression. Whatever Muham· 
mad's purpose, it is important to 
realize that the Nation of Islam does 
not organize its power around anti· 
Semitism. It is also important to kno" 
that history has shown that national· 
ism's twin sibling is anti-Semitism. 
Black nationalism is no exception to 
this rule, and Jews cannot afford to 
ignore history. 
Jewish perceptions of African 
Americans involve far more thaD 
simple vigilance agai nst anti· 
Semitism. Jews spread the diseast 
of racism as much as any other people 
In addition, some Jews seem to have• 
residual paternalistic anger at the 
African-American community for 
becoming separatist during the ci~ 
rights movement. Many J ews feel al 
though they played an important rok 
in that struggle, and not only receiveC 
no thanks, but were told in nc
