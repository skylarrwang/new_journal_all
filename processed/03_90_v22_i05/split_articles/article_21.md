My roommate Michael and I were 
furiously 
debating the causes of 
cultural change in the United States. 
As I pontificated with what I took to be 
rather cogent and spontaneous 
eloquence, I insisted that journalists 
can ·effect genuine progress. "One of 
the most influential books of the 
century," I said, "was The jungle by 
Sinclair Lewis." 
"No," Michael interrupted. "Sinclair 
Lewis wrote Babbitt. You're thinking of 
Upton Sinclair." 
Suddenly it hit me. I realized that I 
never knew the difference between 
Sinclair Lewis and Upton Sinclair. To 
my mind they were both left wing 
American fiction writers of the early 
20th-century, 
pretty much inter-
changeable. 
The conversation stopped. I could 
think of nothing but this mistake that I 
had been making my whole life. How 
long I had lived in this state of 
ignorance! If Michael hadn't shown me 
the error of my ways, who knows how 
long I would have continued to think of 
the Sinclairs as one and the same? 
Michael tried to console me for my 
gaffe. He confessed that he always 
made a similiar mistake with Francis 
and Roger Bacon, 
both 
English 
philosopher-scientists from sometime 
between 1200 and 1700. As far as he 
was concerned, they were both avatars 
of the Enlightenment and expounded 
the scientific method. Then we both 
admitted to having trouble differ-
entiating Stephen 
Douglas from 
Frederick Douglass, contemporaneous 
figures who had something to do with 
Abraham Lincoln and freeing the 
slaves. 
We all have these pairs of people 
whom we hopelessly confuse in our 
own minds, people whose names are 
similar and who share some vague set 
of characteristics. Who, for example, 
can tell me the difference between 
George Sand and George Eliot? Both 
were 19th-century women novelists who 
took on the male nom tk plume. One 
wrote Silas Mamn and one had an 
affair with Chopin, but which one did 
which is anybody's guess. And who can 
keep straight Reagan-Bush lackeys 
Nicholas Brady, James Brady and 
James Baker? At least one of them, I 
think, got shot in the head. 
My brother laughingly recalls a 
friend of his who reeled off a history 
paper just hours before he handed it 
in. His haste did not go unnoticed. 
When he got the paper back, the 
professor had drawn a big circle 
around the phrase, "In James Beard's 
An Economic History of the United 
States . .. " In the margin, the teacher 
had scrawled in red ink, "No, you 
mean Charles Beard. James Beard is a 
chef!" Of course my brother should not 
laugh. He continually mixes up Ingrid 
Bergman and Ingmar Bergmann. 
I was discussing such perplexing 
personages recently with a friend who 
has spent sleepless nights wrestling 
with the distinction between Ben 
Jonson and Samuel Johnson- a 
I had never known 
that Thomas Wolfe 
and Tom Wolfe were 
different people. 
problem complicated by the additional 
pressure of having to know which one 
is referred to as "Dr. Johnson." I told 
him that I often blur the fine line 
between Malcolm Cowley and Mal-
colm Lowrey; it doesn't help that I 
know nothing about either one except 
that their names are bandied about in 
intellectual circles. He shot back with 
the tricky distinction between Thomas 
Wolfe, author of the American classic 
You Can't Go Home Again, and Tom 
Wolfe, who wrote the trendy best-seller 
Bonfire of the Vanities and spoke at 
graduation last 
year. 
I 
was too 
embarrassed to admit that I had never 
known they were different people. 
Fortunately, 
there 
is hope; 
education can help. After majoring in 
American history, I can at last assert 
with confidence that Andrew Jackson, 
not Andrew Johnson, was known as 
"Old Hickory." Never again will I 
speak of Senator Joe McCarthy's 
crusade against the Vietnam War, 
Thomas 
Dewey's 
philosophy of 
education, or Henry Wallace's 
proclamation, "Segregation now, 
segregation forever!" I have finally 
figured out the difference between 
Aaron Burr and Raymond Burr, 
although now I can't tell Raymond 
Burr from Raymond Massey. 
Actors often prove the hardest to 
keep separate. For years I mixed up 
Cary Grant and Gary Cooper. Many 
people I know confess to confusing 
Jackie Cooper and Jackie G Ieason (and 
some throw in Jackie Mason as well). 
For the life of me, I cannot tell 
Christopher Lee of the horror films 
from Christopher Plummer of the 
movie musicals. Finally, while we're at 
it, would someone, please, for once 
and for all, sort out Anthony Hopkins, 
Anthony Perkins, Anthony Quinn and 
Anthony Quayle? 
Athletic figures blur together too. 
Sports fans will recall taking a cut at 
telling apart baseball players Dwight 
Evans and Darrell Evans, tackling 
football coaches Chuck 
Noll and 
Chuck Knox, and, above all, volleying 
back and forth tennis players Vitas 
Gerulaitas and Guillermo Vilas. It's 
the same story for literature buffs, for 
whom the distinctions between Evelyn 
Waugh and Somerset Maugham, 
Henry James and Henry Adams, and 
Jane Austen and Jane Eyre are 
certainly nothing novel. Music majors 
might fine-tune for me German 
composers Robert Schumann and 
Franz Shubert, waltz-kings Johann 
Strauss and Richard Strauss, and 
hyphenated Frenchmen Jean-Luc 
Ponty and Jean-Pierre Rampal. 
People who go by their first two 
initials drive me particularly crazy. 
Try, for example, keeping straight 
E.M. Forster and C.S. Forester, or 
C.S. Lewis and C.P. Snow. I was 
shocked recently to learn that I.F. 
Stone, the liberal Jewish author and 
critic, is not the same person as Irving 
critic, and that neither one of them has 
anything to do with Irving Howe, the 
liberal Jewish author and critic.
