Lonely Mission 
Jennifer Bryson (GRD '90) doesn't like 
the way a lot of Yale students think. 
Not only do they champion abortion 
rights, but she claims they don't even 
listen to what she wants to tell them. As 
a member of Yale Students for Life, 
Bryson sees herself on a mission to 
convert Yale students to the pro-life 
position. "We really think we can make 
a difference," she said. "Even if we 
can't convince everyone, hopefully we 
can influence future doctors and wo-
men who might face crisis pregancies." 
Yale Students for Life, originally the 
Yale Student Pro-life Coalition, 
adopted its current name in 1987 when 
then-president Kelly Askew (DC '88) 
decided it better reflected the group's 
entire agenda, which includes op-
posing infanticide and euthanasia. 
YSL sponsors films, invites speakers to 
campus, distributes table tents, and 
pickets in front of University Health 
Services to protest the hospital's policy 
of providing free abortions for 
students. Several members volunteer 
at Birth Right, a pro-life counseling 
center which encourages alternatives to 
abortion. 
Vincent Mooney (DC '91), presi-
dent of YSL, believes such counseling 
is 
necessary 
because 
women 
are 
ignorant victims of abortion. "A lot of 
people are just misguided, and don't 
understand what abortion does," he 
said. Once people realize the effects of 
abortion, Mooney is convinced that 
they will come to view it as wrong. 
Kathleen Brady (JE '88, DIY '91), a 
member of YSL, said that she believed 
into her junior year at Yale that 
abortion was acceptable. But when she 
learned about fetal development, she 
aligned 
herself with the 
pro-life 
position. 
Still, YSL members remain a dis-
tinct minority here. Although YSL 
membership has doubled since last 
year-from seven to 15-Students

YSL protesters speak to their following outside UHS. 
Organizing Students, 
an abortion 
rights group established just this year, 
has about 40 active participants. Amy 
Waldman (SY '91), coordinator of 
SOS, claims that the group has 
hundreds of sympathizers throughout 
the campus. At a pro-choice rally on 
Cross Campus last November, 
hundreds of supporters cheered 
speeches by feminist Letty Cottin 
Pogrebin and Congressman Bruce 
Morrison, while YSL's small forces 
hovered behind the crowd, resolutely 
holding up protest signs. 
David Gardey (] E '90) said that 
Yale's pro-choice majority 
inhibits 
student participation in YSL. "I think 
that a lot of the people on campus who 
are pro-life are afraid that there will be 
a backlash against them if they come 
outandstatetheiropinion:hesaid. Gardey, 
a member of the Party of the Right, said 
"Pro-choice forces are as intolerant as 
the rest of the left at Yale." In his Â· 
previous activities in the Yale Political 
Union he found 
most students 
unreceptive to real disagreement over 
issues. "There's a whole laundry list of 
issues, and if you go outside that 
dogma, a lot of intolerance shows." 
YSL members said they are subject 
to such intolerance frequently. When 
Faye Wattleton, the national director 
of Planned Parenthood, 
spoke at 
Bartell Chapel last month, a group of 
YSL members demonstrated outside. 
A woman grabbed a placard from 
protester Mark Tafoya (SY '93) and 
told him to "fuck off." Mooney learned 
afterwards that Davenport classmates 
assailed his participation in the 
Wattleton protest. "To hear that they 
were speaking harshly of me behind 
my back really hurt me," he said. A 
series of unsigned table tents in the 
HGS dining hall personally attacked 
Bryson for her pro-life views, and 
Mary Habeck (GRD '94) said the
