EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
A tall muscular black man stood at the 
front of a 
crowded law school 
auditorium. He spoke for three hours 
about racism, its relationship to drug 
dependency, and how the Nation of 
Islam's philosophy can help conquer 
this problem. I looked around at the · 
people of African descent in the 
audience. All those whom I could 
see-whether from Detroit, North 
Carolina, New Haven, South Africa or 
the Bronx-appeared.to have the same 
inspired and enthusiastic air as the 
people from my Baptist Church do 
after a powerful minister delivers a 
thought-provoking and 
uplifting 
sermon. A man wearing a yarmulke 
rose in the middle of the auditorium. 
With an unsteady and sincere voice he 
announced that he was an American, a 
Jew and a · Zionist, and, pointing 
toward the tall figure behind the 
podium, he said with conviction, "I am 
not afraid of you." 
He added 
his fear that the doctor wo~ld say 
words that would lead African 
Americans to harm Jewish people. He 
nervously awaited a response. 

During the speech given by Dr. 
Abdul Alim Muhammad, the national 
spokesperson for the Nation of Islam, 
there was clearly a pronounced gap in 
communication between the different 
groups in attendance. One group 
thought the sermon by Muhammad 
was hateful and offensive, and another 
group thought it educational and 
informative. Sadly, this grouping was, 
to a large extent, determined by race. I 
realize that there were some whites and 
Jews who did approve and a few blacks 
who did not, but the pattern of 
reactions was strong enough to make 
racial perspective relevant. Judging by 
the frequency with which similar 
situations occur, it is apparent that the 
miscommunication and antagonism 
that often exist between blacks and 
Jews are part of the overall miscom-
munication between people of African 
descent and white people in general. 
This problem occurs because most 
white people don't understand black 
people and don't respect them enough 
to try. 

One could take the standing ovation 
by many of the black members of the 
audience as a sign of virulent anti-
Semitism on the part of black people. 
One could also say that this speaker 
was so charismatic that the weak-
minded African people simply lost 
their minds. But if this is true, it must 
follow that the people of a darker color 
in the audience, after hearing such a 
hateful preacher, would also carry 
sentiments of hate. 

Given that 
members from the Nation of Islam 
speak all over the country, one would 
even expect there to be a nationwide 
crisis of African Americans attacking 
Jews and burning synagogues. I've yet 
to hear of such incidents, and I've yet 
to speak to an African American who 
has ever heard a member of the Nat ion 
of Islam advocate the spread of even 
mild animosity toward Jews. It. is 
clear that there is a great deal of mis-
understanding, and the people who do 
not understand are the same people 
who have never understood people of 
my persuasion. 

It is much easier to label someone 
anti-Semitic or a hate monger than to 
deal with what he has to say. This is 
especially true when what is said is 
painful to those who do not wish to be 
seen as oppressors. The need for many 
of the Jewish students to identify 
themselves as.oppressed people (when, 
in the United States, they belong to the 
same oppressive structure to which all 
people of European descent belong) is 
evident in the name of the group 
opposing Muhammad's visit- the 
Committee Against Bigotry. In an 
often racist university, an extremely 
racist city, and a traditionally racist 
country, it is ironic to note that the 
only bigotry the members of this group 
have experienced this year came with 
Muhammud's visit to campus. Appar-
ently it is easier for a traditionally 
oppressed group to feign continued 
oppression than it is for them to deal 
with the nature of our society which 
places those with a certain skin color in 
a class that can dominate the rest. 

Regrettably, the genocide against 
people of African descent is 
no~ 
something I need to read in a history 
book, or ask my parents about. Sadly it 
is something that I learned simply by 
growing up where I did. Drug-related 
crime, cocaine and heroin abuse, and 
now the alarming and rapid spread of 
AIDS among the 
drug-using popu-
lation in my community, all serve to 
destroy an entire generation of my 
people. The Nation of Islam, through 
its 
highly 
successful prisoner 
education, drug rehabilitation and 
"drug busting" programs has clearly 
demonstrated that it has a method that 
can help lead some of the oppressed out 
of the 
behavior that relentlessly 
destroys their lives. 

The Committee Against Bigotry did 
indeed realize this, but still insisted 
that this speaker should not have been 
invited. 
(One speaker on the 
committee went so far as to insist that 
he could not understand how his 
African-American friend could do this 
to him and that this action meant the 
end of their friendship.) This means 
that the saving of black life was less 
valuable to the committee than their 
dislike of an organization that they did 
not even understand. 

This is not surprising, for I believe 
that most white people O ews included) 
feel more strongly about the destruc·
