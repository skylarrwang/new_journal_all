Chris Dudley (TD '87) glanced up at 
the scoreboard. He had two chances to 
tie 
the game 
for 
Cleveland 
Cavaliers. A capacity crowd was on 
hand to watch the Washington Bullets 
battle it out with Dudley and the Cavs 
in the Baltimore Arena. Referee Eric 
Strom handed Dudley the basketball 
for the first of two shots. Dudley sizerl 
up 
the basket and 
released his 
free throw. The shot had a good arc 
but lacked touch. It clanged against the 
iron rim, greatly pleasing the Wash-
ington crowd. 

Dudley took his second shot. Again, 
no luck. This time, though, a Wash-
ington guard moved before the ball hit 
the rim. The violation guaranteed 
Dudley another chance. For a third 
time, the Yalie lofted the ball in the 
general vicinity of the hoop. For a 
third time, Dudley failed to tie up the 
game. But on this attempt, Bullets 
center Dave Feitl jumped too early. 

Dudley stepped up for a fourth 
try- and missed yet again. Remark-
ably, Feitl had again moved too soon, 
so referee Strom, grinning in disbelief,

for the fifth time awarded Dudley the 
ball and the chance to tie the game. 

And Dudley, the worst free throw 
shooter in the NBA, missed again. 

This time, no violation occured, no 
whistle sounded, and Dudley entered 
the recordbooks as the first player ever 
to miss five free throws on one trip to 
the free-throw line. 

The next day, a fan asked if Dudley 
had been studying economics at Yale 
while the rest of the country was 
learning how to take the easiest shot on 
the basketball court. 

Dudley, like other Yale athletes 
playing professional basketball, 
baseball and football, 
often finds 
himself the object of such ribbing. F:ans 
think of Ivy Leaguers as more adept at 
sharpening a pencil than handling a 
ball. Last month, Spanky, a stand-up 
comedian, pointed out to a Yale 
audience that the Elis have produced 
more All-American football players 
than any other school in the nation. 
"Of course," he added, "that was all 
· between 1869 and 1926." 

Spanky may think Yale athletics are 
a joke, but the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association doesn't. Looking 
to reintroduce academics into the 
college athlete's course of study, the 
NCAA sees schools like Yale as a 
model. Over the past 25 years only six 
of Yale football coach Carm Cozza's 
players 
failed 
to graduate. 
Dick 
Schultz, the new executive director of 
the NCAA, admires Yale's ability to 
balance academics and athletics. He 
has introduced a variety of reforms 
based on Ivy League regulations, 
which include reducing the number of 
basketball games, shortening the 
season and eliminating spring practice. 

Yale's academic integrity comes at a 
price. Varsity baseball, basketball and 
football teams at Yale don't stack up 
against most Division I opponents. A 
Yale player with pro potential, al· 
though presumably a star in the Ivy 
League, doesn't face the same competi· 
tion he would at a non-Ivy athletic 
powerhouse. Ed Peterson (PC '92), 
basketball's Ivy League Rookie of the 
Year, said, "We don't play Atlantic 
Coast Conference caliber teams
