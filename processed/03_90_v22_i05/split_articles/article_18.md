Jews must accept that, 
as white people, they 
have the ability to 
oppress others. 
tion of those who are white than they 
do about the destruction of black life. 
As a result, many whites can neither 
admit nor comprehend the full 500-
year horror of the middle passage, 
slavery, lynchings, and the current 
systematic violence against African 
Americans. If the Committee Against 
Bigotry thought that all life was equal, 
they would have formed much earlier. 
They would have already been 
attacking the oppressive forces from 
which they benefit. 
This deep disrespect is not reciprocal. 
People of African descent 
understand the Holocaust 
and the 
reasons why Jews would want their 
own state. This understanding makes 
it possible for African Americans to 
realize that when Jews claim to support 
the state of Israel, 
it does not 
necessarily mean that they are for the 
murder of blacks in South Africa. 
Israel has a well-known policy of 
selling arms to that still oppressive 
regime. This makes them as morally 
culpable for the death in that country 
as Mercedes is for its role in the 
Holocaust. In light of this, I would not 
demand that Hillel cut all ties to Israel, 
nor demand that they not invite 
anyone from that often 
morally 
bankrupt country to come to Yale. I 
realize that to most Jews, Israel is a 
matter of survival, and, unlike others, 
I have enough respect for people to 
never expect them to give up their 
means of survival. I have a moral 
obligation to speak out against this 
blatant act of racism on the part of the 
Israeli government, and 
I 
would 
expect Jews who support Israel to do 
the same. 
Jews must accept that, as white 
people, they have the ability to oppress 
others. The Palestinians are well aware 
of this. When the Black Student 
Alliance at Yale brought a member of 
the PLO to Yale three years ago, 
BSAY was widely accused of engaging 
in an offensive and anti-Semitic act. 
To many of those who worked on that 
forum, however, it was simply a 
matter of recognizing that people can 
be oppressed by other traditionally 
oppressed groups. It was only offensive 
to those with no desire to be reminded 
of their own racism. 
After 500 years of building a system 
based on certain racial assumptions, 
valuing the contributions and 
humanity of whites over people of 
color becomes an unspoken way of life. 
Racism has ingrained itself in 
everything from standards of beauty to 
the different ways our society worships 
God. When black life 
and self-
determination are devalued, I consider 
it the only natural response of a 
conditioned society. Jews, like other 
European ethnic groups, are 
susceptible to 
the same racial 
disrespect as other white people. This 
disrespect will continue to occur until 
white people realize the depth to which 
they must question their actions. To 
assume people of color are either 
misguided, paranoid, overly sensitive, 
or anti-Semitic is to disrespect the 
intelligence of people of color and to 
further the perverted racist atmosphere 
so prevalent in this society.
