They like my movies." 
Still, why doesn't he head for 
Hollywood, 
direct 
major studio 
projects and earn buckets of cash? 
Roemer explained, "I wasn't 
determined not to go to Hollywood. I 
just thought that it wasn't going to 
work." At the time that he was making 
The Plot Against Harry, Roemer refused 
offers to direct several films including 
an adaptation of Philip Roth's Goodbye, 
Columbus. "If I had a really good touch 
for big, popular movies, I'd have made 
them." 

"If you had killed your 
father and married 
your mother, you 
probably wouldn't 
want to put it on 
stage." 

A director with demonstrably non-
commercial leanings, Roemer is afraid 
of getting hurt by Hollywood. He 
argues that directors must be realistic 
about their abilities. "If somebody told 
you that you should join the swim 
team, you'd tell them that you'd lose all 
their races for them. And if you tried to 
race, you might sprain your back the 
first time out and go to the hospital for 
three weeks and miss a semester of 
school. That's kind of the way it was 
for me." 

Even though he has just sold the 
options on a comedy script entitled 
Famous Long Ago, Roemer refuses to 
change his lifestyle. "I'm now 62, not 
39, and I'm not going to do anything 
that I haven't been doing all along." 

:~ut with people going wild about 
Harry 
in New York and maybe now 
abroad, Michael Roemer might fmd it 
difficult to stay put.
