Columbia Pictures. The movie execu-
tives hated it. Convinced that he had 
made a lousy movie, Roemer scrapped 
the project before completing post-
production, and gave up on comedy 
altogether. H e has made three feature 
films since: two dramas and a highly 
acclaimed documentary about victims 
of terminal illness called Dying. 

Last year, Roemer decided to put 
Ha'!Y on videotape for his children. 
Wh1le transferring the print from film 
to 
tape, 
a 
technician burst into 
laughter and Roemer reconsidered the 
long-forgotten project. He reworked 
the soundtrack and sent prints to the 
New York and Toronto Film Festivals. 
A~?iences at both festivals raved. The 
cnt1cs also liked it. Janet Maslin of The 
Ntw York Timts described the film as "a 
funny, sharply drawn, appealingly 
modest film," and David Denby of Ntw 
York magazine called Harry "a cult 
movie you can take your mother to." 

Shot in black and white to evoke the 
cinima vbiti documentaries of the time, 
the movie satirizes the life of Harry 
Plotnick, a smalltime operator in the 
Manhattan numbers game. Caught 
amidst 
swarm of call 
girls, 
Congressmen and petty criminals, 
Harry tries to reform his life by 
reacquainting himself with his 
estranged family. Harry, though, can't 
escape the complications of the past. 
When Harry is hit with a case of 
indigestion, he thinks he is having a 
fatal heart anack. In what he takes to 
be his fmal moments, he donates his 
savings to charity dOd takes the rap for 
a crime he did not commit. The jokes 
are played extremely straight; Roemer 
expects audiences to spot amusing 
details. In the background of one scene 
a toddler spreads photographs of her 
lingerie-clad m other across the kitchen 
floor. Not too many viewers were 
attentive enough, it turned out, to spot 
the jokes. 

People in 1969, Roemer suggests, 
were not sophisticated enough to deal 
with Tht Plot Against Harry. "For one 
thing, the film moved too fast for 
people. They couldn't pick up signals 
and they couldn't follow the narrative." 
Roemer explained that today people 
are far more adept at recognizing 
important details in a film. "You just 
watch MTV and see how quickly 
things move. People pick up signals 
very fast today." 

Viewers didn't 
like 
Roemer's 
penchant for documentary either. "The
