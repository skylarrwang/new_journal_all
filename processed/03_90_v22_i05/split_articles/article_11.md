and urgently pointed 
to the 
end of the arena. Behind the 
starting line, 
the 
audience was 
lining up next to the edge of the 
neoprene sheets, hardly keeping clear 
of them as instructed. Suddenly, 
the Mudboggers took off, spraying 
huge splats of mud beyond the peri-
meter of the arena. It stuck to the skin, 
hair and clothing of the fans, who 
screamed with delight and wriggled in 
ecstasy. 

That confirmed it. The Tractor Pull 
was not an isolated American pheno-
menon, but a transcendent ritual 
defying time and space. The Spanish 
corrida and the Roman gladiator fight 
are early ancestors of the American 
Tractor Pull. In all of these events, the 
witness to the amoral action envelops 
himself in the spectacle and becomes a 
participant. In the climactic moment, 
the blood spills to the dirt, the bull 
topples into the dust, the junker is 
flattened into The Bog, and the 
audience is splashed with mud. 

The lights went up and the crowd, 
now satiated, began to file out. Then I 
realized that the roots of the Tractor 
Pull go back deeper than the bullfight, 
even deeper than the gladiators, to the 
tragic festivals of Ancient Greece. The 
very moment that the mudthirsty 
crowd tastes a mouthful of the brown 
stuff, it undergoes an Aristotelian 
catharsis- when the body senses 
emotional relief and is cleansed. All 
that remains is for the tragic chorus to 
deliver its epilogue, vocal advice for all 
proud men to be humble and all 
passions to be tempered. 

There was no chorus at the New 
Haven Coliseum, but there was Jack 
Arnold. As the Saturday night crowd 
slowly made its way toward the 
illuminated exits, his voice followed 
them over the loudspeakers, into the 
bathrooms and lobbies, and spilled out 
into the parking lot: "Just a reminder, 
for y'all to drive very safely going home 
now. Goodnight."
