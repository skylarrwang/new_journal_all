Last fall, Andrew Wolff(PC '91) heard 
that Hunt Baldwin, head of Yale 
University Pictures, wanted somebody 
to make a movie. A year earlier, a 
student received a grant from the 
chaplain's office to shoot a video about 
poverty in New Haven, but he 
graduated before completing the 
project. Although Wolff had never 
made a documentary before, Baldwin, 
a friend, asked him to finish the 
discontinued work. Wolff accepted, 
enlisting his 
roommate, Dave 
Sampliner (PC '91), and Roy Tsao 
(BR '91), with whom he worked at 
Dwight Hall, to collaborate on the 
project. 

The three 
narrowed the 
documentary's focus. "We knew that 
poverty was too big an issue to get a 
handle on," Wolff said, so he chose the 
smaller, more manageable topic of 
homelessness. "It's such an up-and-
coming problem. New Haven is one of 
the cities in America where the 
problem is the worst." 

For the past three months, 
Sampliner, Tsao and Wolff have 
consulted 
shelter coordinators, 
politicians, journalists and advocates 
for the homeless. The three have 
volunteered at New Haven's newly 
opened Anawim Shelter, visited 
emergency housing motels, and spent 
time in City Hall offices. Mostly, 
though, they have been talking with 
people who have lived on the streets. 
"The filin is going to be homeless 
people themselves talking," Tsao said. 
"Our aim is to give a sector of the 
population that has no voice at all some 
voice in the public sphere." 

Acting on recommendations from 
caseworkers, the students contacted 
both emergency shelter residents and 
formerly homeless people who have 
since found 
permanent 
housing. 
"Before we even take out our camera, 
we talk to them first, then go back 
another time and ftlm them, just 
letting them talk and asking a few 
questions," Tsao said. "It's amazing 
how many of the homeless people we 
interview 
really welcome 
this 
opportunity to speak out." 

The team is not talking directly with 
the homeless people they meet on the 
street. "Interviewing is very 
intrusive by nature," Wolff said. "I just 
don't feel comfortable walking up to 
people with or even without a camera." 
He added that the street environment 
is not conducive to interviews. "It 
would be impractical to film people on 
the street. We're not just interested in 
hearing a couple of sentences. We want· 
to hear about these people's lives." 

While focusing primarily on indi-
viduals, the team also analyzes social 
and political factors that lead to 
homelessness. "It's a problem that is 
very much misunderstood." Tsao said. 
"People 
still 
·believe 
the 
old 
myth of the drunken 
bum. 
And 
there's a 
phenomenal 
amount of 
bureaucratic bullshit that goes 
on-attitude problems, money that's 
spent and wasted, money that's appro-
priated and never spent. People just 
get phenomenally screwed by the 
system." 

So tar, the three have concentrated 
mainly on background research; they 
have only recently begun ft.lming. "At 
the beginning we didn't know the focus 
of the piece, so it was important to 
gather information," Sampliner said. 
They spent two weeks of winter break 
investigating their topic and inter-
viewing experts on homelessness. This 
semester, they have been devoting 15 
hours per week to the project. 

Although Sampliner admitted, "We 
don't have tons of footage," Tsao 
insisted that they will wind up with 
hundreds of hours of videotape, which 
they will edit down to an hour-long 
documentary. They hope to complete 
the film this spring and screen it for the 
Yale and New Haven communities. 
"We want to try to get it either on PBS 
or Channel 8. We have contacts with 
both of them," Wolff said. 

The ftlm remains far from complete, 
but Sampliner 
fmds 
the project 
rewarding. "Before, I had a vague, 
liberal concern about homelessness, 
but I didn't know how to address it," he 
said. "I really enjoy gaining full , 
substantive knowledge about the 
problem." Also, as a result of their 
work at Anawim, the three coor-
dinated a volunteer program for the 
shelter; currently 20 Yale students 
donate time there. "That's something I 
might not have become involved in if it 
hadn't been for the film," Tsao said. 

Because of the volunteer program 
and their work on the documentary, 
the team sees homelessness on a 
personal level, not just as a sound bite 
on the evening news. They hope that 
their fUm wiJI give its viewers the same 
insight. "Homeless people are not just 
a category, they're people, and a vast 
number of them are incredibly per-
ceptive and incredibly astute poli-
tically," Wolff said. 
"It's hard 
sometimes 
for 
Yale 
students 
to 
appreciate that."
