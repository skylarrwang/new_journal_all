The Mudthirsty Crowd 
The Monster coughed out a cloud of 
exhaust, hesitated for a moment, then 
burst ahead. There was no ramp. It 
didn't matter. The front wheels struck 
the side of a rusty, dilapidated Dodge, 
squashing the door. The Monster's 
forward momentum drove its front end 
up into the air and the entire truck was 
airborne. It hovered for 
a 
full 
second- a second filled with dozens of 
flashes· and thousands of gasps- before 
plummeting back to Earth on four 
other junkers. The beast landed so 
hard on one that the car's left-turn 
signal started blinking, a pathetic cry 
for mercy. After prancing back and 
forth across the tops of the junkers, the 
Monster descended gingerly from its 
helpless victims. Debbie Rhoden, the 
truck's driver, calmly unstrapped her 
helmet, waved to the New Haven 
crowd, and sped off the floor. 
The graceful performance of "Hot . 
Stuff," a Big Block Jeep with a 
454-cubic-inch engine that runs on 
alcohol, 
was just one of several 
spectacles at the Tractor Pull and 
Mudbog competition at the New 
Haven Coliseum February 2 and 3. 
Last October, 
some friends had 
dragged me, reluctant and scornful, to 
a similar event; this time I returned 
eagerly. While the fans around me ate 
blue cotton candy, chewed Skoal and 
passed around the Southern Comfort, 
I sat hunched over, scribbling madly 
on my pad, trying to take in what had 
become, according to announcer Jack 
Arnold, "the number-one attraction in 
the nation." 

The Tractor Pull and Mudbog has 
earned this supreme status only in 
recent years. The shows began a few 
years ago as local tractor pull contests 
in the fields behind tri-county fairs. 
Spectators liked the events, and the 
popularity of the competitions 
snowballed. Today, the National Hot 
Rod Association organizes nationwide 
tours from Yakima, Washington to 
Tampa, Florida featuring surprise 
appearances by half-million-dollar 
robots, double-engined 18-wheelers, 
and television celebrities. Large 
corporations such as Anheuser-Busch 
sponsor the events. 

After Hot Stuff and two other 
Monster Trucks had done their 
damage, 
the junkers were barely 
recognizable scraps of metal, and, 
sadly, even that left-turn signal had 
ceased to blink. But there was no time 
for mourning. It was time for the next 
event. 

The announcer introduced us to 
Danny Reeve, a famous professional 
stuntman 
who doubled 
for 
Erik 
Estrada's partner on the hit T.V. 
program C.H.iP. :S. Ree~~· known on 
the circuit as "Mr. TNT," performed 
his legendary feat of locking himself in 
a box with two ignited sticks of 
dynamite. After a deafening explosion, 
little chunks of the box were strewn 
about the floor, and Reeve lay flat on 
his back, unconscious for ten seconds. 
When he came to, he reminded us not 
to leave and go try something like that 
in our own homes. "Basically, it feels 
like someone takes a large two-by-four 
and whacks you across the back with 
it," Reeve explained. Another thing 
not to try at your next backyard 
barbecue. 

After witnessing such a display, 
Tom Andrus (TD '92) had to ask, 
"Why? Why would any man ever want 
to do a thing like that?" Many Yale 
students, in turn, might ask why. Why 
would any one at Yale go to see a New 
Haven Tractor Pull on a Saturday 
night, especially when high-cultured 
groups like the New Haven Symphony 
and Yaledancers were performing that 
very evening? 

Those who have attended a tractor 
pull fmd the appeal quite natural. "I 
think the Monster Trucks are just as 
valid a 
cultural event as 
the 
symphony," said Jessica Nordhaus QE 
'90). "There's a danger of viewing those 
events with a touch of Yale snobbery, 
as if it were a lower townie thing. But I 
have to admit that I was intrigued from 
the start, and entertained by the 
show." Like Andrus, Nordhaus came 
"Basically, it feels like 
someone takes a large 
two-by-four and 
whacks you across the 
back with it."

to Yale from a city in the West where 
"everyone seemed to get into their 
trucks, fLXing them up with huge 
wheels and lights." When she heard 
the announcements of "power . . . 
power . . . power" in the "mud . . . 
mud ... mud," she wanted to see for 
herself what it was all about. Greg 
Widmeyer (CC '90) had his own 
reasons for going. "I think people enjoy 
watching Monster Trucks for the same 
reason they can't help looking at an 
auto accident on the highway," he said. 
"I guess it's just a fascination with 
destruction." 

.Before anyone could reflect too 
much on the appeal of Reeve's display 
that night, Jack Arnold's voice directed 
our attention back to the arena. 
"Hurry back to your seats," he said, 
"especially if you have children, for 
they sure won't want to miss the next 
event." Meanwhile, a man in a red cap 
sneaked into the middle of the mud 
and plopped down an orange cube 
which had the words "I CAN'T" 
written on every side. Then he crept 
silently away. No one mentioned this, 
and I grew suspicious. 

Suddenly the lights blacked out. 
"Ladies and gentlemen 
in 
audience, if you would direct your 
attention to where the strobe light and 
spotlight are pointing, you will see 
(long pause) Vorion!" The throbbing 
lights focused on a gate, which in the 
stadiums of Spain or Rome let in the 
bull or lion. This time the gates opened 
to let in Vorion, a 40-foot-long vehicle 
that looked like a red and silver 
Batmobile. 

"Only the voice of the children can 
make Vorion appear. He has to hear 
them call him out, so let's tell him, boys 
and girls," said Arnold. I found myself 
chanting along with the nine-year-olds 
in the crowd. "Vo-ri-on! Vo-ri-on!" 

The metamorphosis occurred. Like 
a giant plastic Transformer toy, the 
top of the vehicle slowly rose on hinges 
behind the back axle to become a 
terrifying, mechanical robot, shooting 
thunderbolts from its right fist and

throwing flames with its left. From 
behind its glowing red eyes, the 
mechanical voice introduced itself. 
"I am Vorion." With a poof, it sent 
forth a flame. "I hold the power to 
change my future." Zap-out came a 
thunderbolt. "If you boys and girls 
(poof) believe in me (zap) you too will 
hold the power." Then Vorion stopped 
swinging its arms and firing at 
random, and took us children into its 
confidence. "The only things that keep 
us from becoming what or who we 
want to be," it said, "are the words 'I 
CAN'T.' Concentrate your energies to 
help me destroy the I CAN'T box, 
and we will be free." I shut my eyes as 
hard as I could as it took aim with its 
thunderbolt arm, fired at the box, and 
splintered it into . thousands of tiny 
fragments. 

Perhaps even tales ofVorion's magic 
won't convince 
all the skeptics. 
Sophisticated city slickers will still scoff . 
at the mention of Monster Trucks or 
Mudbog competitions. Like their 
patrician 
ancestors of the Ancient 
Roman Colosseum, they consider the 
barbaric events of the 20th-century 
New Haven Coliseum as far beneath 
their dignitas. But if the Tractor Pull 
and Mudbog events resemble a circus, 
it must be a descendant of the Circus 
Maximus, where men were thrown to 
lions and gladiators battled it out on 
the dirt. Indeed, there is something 
timeless about St. Augustine's 
description in his Confessions, of 
a philosophic friend who was half 
inclined to be Christian and who 
on principle detested such 
spectacles, 
but once allowed 
himself to be drawn into the fatal 
circle. At first he resolved to close 
his eyes to the ghastly horrors of 
the scene. 
Presently, at the 
applause raised by some crisis in 
the conflict, his eyes opened and 
would not be withdrawn. The 
fumes of the camage seemed to 
intoxicate his senses; he lost his 
identity, and became one of the 
bloodthirsty crowd. He left eager 
to return once again. 

Half the experience of the 
Mudboggers and Monster Trucks, ac-
cording to Widmeyer and Nordhaus, 
was breathing the carbon monoxide 
exhaust fumes that hovered in the 
stands. "It is a very sensory experience, 
with the noise and exhaust filling the 
air, and all the dirt and trucks on the 
floor," said Nordhaus. "Even up high 
in the stands you feel like you are part 
of the event." As the fumes intoxicated 
my senses, I, too, like St. Augustine's 
friend, lost my identity and became 
one of the mudthirsty crowd. 

It stuck to the skin, 
hair and clothing of 
the fans, who 
screamed with delight 
and wriggled in 
ecstasy. 

The tractor pull also owes something 
to the Spanish bullfight. Just as 
mankind's primitive slaughter of el toro 
takes on beautiful and tragic propor-
tions when carried out as 
pure 
spectacle, so our steel machinery, 
taken out of its early function of 
plowing land on the rugged frontier, 
becomes noble and dramatic when put 
on display for 12 dollars and 50 cents. 
And in both cases, the central image 
is dirt. Hard dirt breeds hard drama. It 
is the stage for ritual. In the American 
ritual, of course, the dirt is American 
made, just like the bulldozers and 
steamrollers which spread it evenly 
over the concrete floor of the New 
Haven Coliseum, just like the blue 
cotton candy and the tobacco spat into 
paper cups in the packed grandstands. 

For the Mudbog competition, the 
final act of the weekend's drama, two 
Caterpillar bulldozers and three dump 
trucks hauled 24 tons of dirt from miles 
away. The dirt was leveled into thin 
layers on the outer parts of the arena 
and in the center was piled up a mound 
which, once sprayed down with water, 
would become "The Bog.'' 

Hundreds of square yards of 
transparent neoprene plastic covered 
the bleacher seats to insulate the stands 
from the muck of the Mudbogger 
competition. In 
perfect 
formation 
around The Bog were dozens of trucks 
and beefed-up four-wheelers with 
names like Pirty Dirty, MudBuster, 
Pit Boss and Bushwacker. "These 
'Boggers, "said Arnold, "are made for 
one thing and one thing only, and that 
is to get across the mud as fast as 
possible." 

But long before the Mudboggers 
skipped across the mud at such high 
velocities, the authorities hooked wires 
to the engines which would auto-
matically shut off the vehicles when 
they had gone the distance across the 
trench. This safety precaution kept the 
PitBosses from MudBustin out of the 
arena and Bushwackin the crowd. 

At one point during the preparation 
one of the cables got stuck in the mud, 
and a man had to be lifted in the 
bucket of a bulldozer to retrieve it and 
to hook it back overhead. The fans 
grew impatient, and the announcer 
tried to pacify them. "Maybe if you all 
cheer loud enough, that man down 
there will jump off into the pit," he 
suggested. I envisioned him lying face 
down, spread-eagled, two feet deep in 
the mud ... mud . . . mud. Finally, 
after finishing his work, the man, 
perhaps himself intoxicated by the 
fumes, began waving his arms to rouse 
the audience, and then crouched and 
lept into the abyss. His feet must have 
sunk no more than four inches. His 
jeans didn't even get dirty. The crowd 
booed. 

I reflected on this for some time. I 
considered how the Spanish audience 
was disappointed if the matador did 
not get blood on his clothing from close 
brushes with the bull. I thought of how 
the Roman audience only admired a 
gladiator if he wounded himself 
courting death. The authorities clearly 
underestimated the hunger of the 
crowd.
