To the Editor, 
The May Day issue stirred up in me 
what I guess fd have to call a nostalgia 
for those weird but also exciting days. 
There were a few minor errors, such 
as Mark Ribbing's suggesting that it 
was the students who decided to 
"liberate" their colleges and open them 
up to the visiting radicals. 
David 
G reenberg set the record straight on 
that- though there is a curious stamp 
of thinking of the '80s in his saying that 
back in those '60s Brewster was "always 
cultivating the image of approach-
ability." 
The stress on image-making came 
into play with the TV commercials and 
the "media spins" and the photo-ops of 
much later politics. The fact was 
simpler: Brewster was approachable, 
he didn't care whether he looked that 
way. He showed up night after night in 
college common rooms to talk things 
out with students. He was at the other 
end of the stick from Benno. 

I think Sam Chauncey may have 
misled Greenberg a bit about the 
opposition of the masters to opening 
the colleges. There were two Masters 
who seemed to be scared shitless, but 
in the Council of Masters before May 
Day, the suggestion for opening up the 
gates and welcoming the outsiders 
actually came first from one of the 
Masters, Elias Clark, and all the rest 
but those two supported his idea, 
which Brewster then took up and 
carried through 
with 
his usual 
panache. 

I loved Ruth Conniffs piece on 
Trudeau. Is it her father who took the 
cover picture? 
Anyway, congratulations. The 
project was very much worth doing. 
Good to get your contemporaries to 
think about those strange, earnest, 
caring days.

You have assembled an impressive 
collection of pieces for the New 
Journal's retrospective on May Day, 
1970. 
I 
have 
listened to 
many 
recollections, 
and 
read 
packing 
boxloads of memorabilia, 
letters, 
documents-dealing with the multi-
layered ironic "scraps of history." 
hope one day a 
thoughtful, 
in formed book will be done on the 
Brewster years, collecting the scraps 
into a continuity and a perspective. 
The quality of writing and editing of 
The New journal speaks well of a Yale 
education. 
Hurrah for you.
