f you turn left from Chapel 
Street onto Orange Street and walk 
about a block, chances are you’ll see 
a group of teenagers performing kick-
flips and ollies on the pavement. They’ll 
be outside a storefront with a giant wall 
of glass. That’s Plush: New Haven’s only 
dedicated skate shop, decorated with 
colorful skateboard decks and populated 
with the trendiest gear on the market. 

Sir-Michael Burrow is the employee 
behind Plush’s white, rounded counter. 
As soon as I walk in, he shoots me a big 
smile and waves me over. “Feel free 
to ask any questions about anything 
in shop, and I’ll pull it out for you,” 
he says. He’s sporting a simple white 
T-shirt and blue jeans, nothing 
flashy. His outfit blends in with the 
plain white wall behind him. White 
accents—they’re everywhere. They 
contrast sharply with the colorful 
racks of clothes that hang a few 
feet from him, displaying popular 
brands such as Carhartt, Dickies, 
and Converse. 

Burrow is from Waterbury, 
Connecticut, and has been skat-
ing in New Haven since he was 
17. Now, at 25, he has a glint in his 
eyes when he talks about skating. 
He’s flanked by containers over-
flowing with skate periodicals and 
poster books. 

Burrow’s favorite word is “side-
bar.” As we begin to talk about 
Plush and its connection to New 
Haven skating, he throws it into 
our conversation to add more con-
text to the growth of Connecticut’s 
skating culture. “Just a sidebar,” he 
says. “Another sidebar.” 

Sidebar: a skate video filmed in 
Connecticut in the nineteen-nine-
ties called Mama’s Boys brought 
more skaters to the city and 
revitalized New Haven’s scene. Sidebar: 
when Plush opened, Vans came and shot 
a piece that put New Haven on the map 
again. Sidebar: for the past few decades, a 
vibrant skate film culture has been brew-
ing in the city.

Before Plush opened in 2022, the 
last skateboarding shop in the city 
closed in 2015. The closure left New 
Haven skaters with a long commute to 
find gear and community.

Alexis 
Sablone, 
an 
Olympic 
skateboarder, and Trevor Thompson, 
also a professional skater, both grew 
up around New Haven and recog-
nized the inaccessibility of central-
ized hubs for skating culture in their 
home state and city. They decided to 
open Plush, harnessing the power of 
the local skateboarding community, 
and the expertise of Connecticut-area 
skaters like Burrow, to bring the shop 
to life.

Burrow tells me that their industry 
connections as professional skaters made 
the opening process seamless.

“Anyone can open a skate 
shop, but, like, you need to know 
what the hell’s actually going 
on in the trend scene and what 
companies are cool like the back 
of your hand,” Burrow said. “As 
pros, Alexis and Trevor are 
friends with people who are pros. 
It’s about being plugged in.”

Rifling through the clothing 
racks of the store—organized 
by color to create a rainbow of 
choices—you’ll find high-end 
skate brands ranging from the 
more commercial Vans to the 
Colorado-based 
Polar 
Skate 
Co. Behind the hanging clothes 
is a mural of skate decks and 
boards; to the left of them, you’ll 
find a wall displaying the most 
trendy sneakers on the market. 
The highly-curated selection of 
options in Plush and the aes-
thetic of their presentation make 
it feel like not just a skate shop, 
but an art gallery. 

Plush’s role in New Haven 
isn’t really retail, though. It’s to 
create a space where New Haven 
skaters can come together and 
build camaraderie. 

Plush holds monthly events, 
like skate video screenings and
