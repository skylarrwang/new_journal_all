I watch Jiang. He says nothing, just 
smiles and chuckles. Everyone else is 
speaking in a language that he does 
not understand.


Articles reviewing Chef Jiang online 
make sure to highlight the restaurant’s 
more exotic dishes: gizzards, frogs, 
stinky tofu. I wonder if the perceived 
abnormality of these foods is meant to 
indicate their authenticity, as though 
the sign of a properly foreign meal is 
that it seems instinctively unappealing 
to the traditional American palate. I 
wonder, also, when Americans started 
caring so much about the legitimacy of 
ethnic food anyways.


Online, I watch a segment of a 
local news station from one month ago. 
In the video, Jiang stands alongside 
his marketing manager and two news 
anchors before four platters of food. “A 
lot of us are getting Chinese food, but 
we’re not getting the real Chinese food,” 
one of the news anchors explains.


That’s the selling point: authentic-
ity. The food is real because the tofu is 
spicy and the fish comes with its head 
still attached. Jiang’s marketing man-
ager tells the anchors that these are 
examples of dishes that Chinese people 
might cook at home, and the anchors 
marvel at how different this food is 
from the Chinese food that they had 
always known. Throughout the video, 
Jiang tells me that he adjusts 
his cooking to be more accessible 
for American customers. In addition 
to lowering spice levels, he has also 
included in his menu a section devoted 
to Americanized Chinese food sta-
ples like General Tso’s chicken and 
Mongolian Beef. Most American cus-
tomers, he reasons, will first come to 
Chef Jiang for these familiar dishes. But 
when they come back, they might try 
something more adventurous, and then 
they’ll keep coming back to try new 
things, and they’ll bring their friends 
along, and this is the slow process of 
teaching Americans what Chinese food 
really is, so that someday, maybe Jiang 
won’t need to put General Tso’s chicken 
on his menu.


In the meantime, though, he tells 
me that he isn’t particularly bothered by 
questions of authenticity.
“I just want people to eat here,” he says.

In Chinese, when you call some-
thing authentic, you say that it is 
dìdào. The word itself is constructed 
of two characters, one meaning “land,” 
the other “road.” This makes me think 
about how the concept of authentic 
cuisine never would have existed if 
people hadn’t traveled so far away from 
their own native lands. The original 
use of the term, dating back to the 
Ming dynasty, was actually as praise 
for products of a certain locale. Since 
then, however, dìdào has taken on 
an additional meaning: that which is 
tangible or real. To me, there is some-
thing that feels so Chinese about this—
the idea that truth must be intimately 
tied to home. 


I eat dinner at Chef Jiang twice in 
the span of two weeks. The first time, 
I wait half an hour on a busy Saturday 
night to get a table with two friends, 
neither of whom are Chinese. We order 
scallion pancakes, chow fun, stir-fried 
lamb, bean sprouts, and Dan Dan noo-
dles. As we eat, I find myself informing 
them that this is the good stuff, the real 
deal of Chinese cuisine. By the end of 
the meal, we are exhausted—both from 
eating and from talking about how 
excellent the food is.


My second dinner at Chef Jiang is 
during the Lunar New Year, upon the 
invitation of a family friend—a Chinese 
professor at Yale. She is from Shanghai 
and is probably the best cook I know. I 
ask her how she recognizes when a dish 
is authentic or not. “I only really know 
if I’ve had it before,” she says, which I 
understand as her graceful way of tell-
ing me that my question is a poor one.


In the middle of dinner, I take a 
quick trip to the bathroom. In one cor-
ner, there is a palm-like plant in a dark 
blue ceramic pot. I reach down to press 
my fingers against the roots. I feel the 
smoothness of the plant and the soft-
ness of the dirt. It’s real.


After our first interview, Jiang 
insists that I bring some food back to 
my dorm. From the menu, I select the 
wontons in chili oil, which he packs up 
for me in a black plastic container. 
If you want to know the truth, I 
have no idea if the food at Chef Jiang 
is authentic or not. I haven’t been back 
to China in close to ten years. When 
I go out for dinner with my non-Chi-
nese friends and try to explain whether 
the scallion pancakes are real or unreal, 
it’s an exercise in bullshit, the indul-
gence in a feeling of expertise that I 
can claim and others cannot. This is 
one of the pleasures of tribalism—the 
ethnic secret, the esoteric knowl-
edge, the self-aggrandizing idea that 
my taste buds actually do have some 
instinct for truth.


We never even made scallion pan-
cakes at my house. Instead, we bought 
them frozen from the Chinese grocery 
store and heated them with slices of 
cheddar cheese melted blasphemously 
on top.


But when I sit on my couch and 
eat Jiang’s wontons, I remember mak-
ing wontons at my kitchen table, and 
also the restaurant back at home where 
my mom used to order this same dish 
for me after school. I think about how 
these wontons taste like something 
familiar. And how, when we say that 
food is authentic, what we mean is that 
it tastes like something we have tasted 
before. That’s all it really is. Just the 
commonplace longing for something 
that you already know.
“Exactly,” Jiang says, when I try to 
explain all this to him at the end of our 
last interview. He nods at me, as though 
in approval. “Authenticity is just what 
we say about something that makes us 
think of home.” ∎
