Diana Gilman-Ford doesn’t like to fly. 
She hasn’t been on a plane since the late 
nineteen-nineties, and even then, she didn’t 
make it off the ground. While the plane was still 
on the tarmac, she suffered a panic attack and had 
to disembark. Still, for most of her life, Gilman-
Ford looked up at planes in the sky with awe. 
What a marvel, she used to think. Men in the sky. 
Then, in August 2022, Tweed New Haven 
Airport, located just 50 yards down the street 
from Gilman-Ford’s house, entered into a 
forty-three-year contract with the airport 
management company Avports LLC. The deal 
paved the way for a one-hundred-million-dol-
lar investment in the expansion of the air-
port. A year earlier, in May 2021, the Airport 
Authority had announced a new partnership 
with Avelo Airlines, an ultra-low-cost carrier 
that began offering flights out of New Haven 
in November 2021. 
Now, over twenty Boeing 737 jets take off 
and land each day on the Tweed runway, situ-
ated three miles from downtown New Haven. 
Sometimes the jets move as late as 10:30 p.m. 
Gilman-Ford calls her house, which she has 
lived in for twelve years, a newfound “night-
mare.” She keeps her windows closed to block 
the smell of jet fuel. She stopped hanging the 
clothesline and pruning the garden last year. 
And then there’s the noise. “I don’t even have 
words for the noise,” Gilman-Ford said. “There 
are times it’s so bad you cannot even function.”


“I have great empathy for people who live 
near the airport,” said Matthew Hoey, the First 
Selectman of Guilford and Chair of the Tweed 
Airport Authority Board. Still, he has sup-
ported the airport expansion from the begin-
ning. He worked with Avports and Avelo in 
the initial stages to secure their investments. 
From his perspective, the expansion of Tweed 
is for the common good. “The success of the 
airport has spillover for the region, and for the 
immediate vicinity,” Hoey said. And besides, 
“No one who bought a house didn’t know the 
airport was there.”


Opponents and proponents of the Tweed 
Airport expansion seem to operate in entirely 
different registers. Critics of the airport, 
largely residing within a few miles of Tweed, 
denounce the noise and air pollution, as well 
as increased traffic and safety concerns. Gretl 
Gallicchio, who lives in New Haven near 
the airport, said that she had to “completely 
reevaluate what it means to have a future” in 
her once quiet neighborhood. “It’s depressing,” 
she said, “to watch the place where we’ve lived 
be destroyed.”


Residents of these low-lying, shoreline 
neighborhoods already contend with warming 
and flooding, local consequences of the global 
climate crisis. They are skeptical of the value 
of Tweed’s future LEED-certified, energy-effi-
cient terminal—especially when the aviation 
industry plays a massive role in carbon emis-
sions. Such environmental concerns would be 
compounded by jumbo jets, the traffic, and the 
increased strain on emergency services that 
will come with the expansion.


Proponents of the airport are quick to rec-
ognize these concerns but dismiss them with 
utilitarian logic—more people will benefit from 
Tweed than will be hurt, and thus the expansion 
will be justified. The benefit takes many forms: 
economic growth from jobs in aviation and con-
struction, accessible and affordable travel from 
Avelo’s budget flights, and a potential decrease 
in energy use after construction of the new, 
LEED-certified terminal. 


The one thing everyone can agree upon is 
how enormous and successful the expansion 
of Tweed services has been already, and how 
impactful future changes will likely continue 
to be. Since the first Avelo flight took off from 
New Haven on November 3, 2021, and landed 
in Orlando about two hours later, Avports 
has seen an eleven-fold increase in air traf-
fic at Tweed. In 2020, there were thirty-eight 
thousand enplanements at Tweed. In 2023, 
there were 465,538. According to Tom Rafter, 
Executive Director of the Tweed New Haven 
Airport Authority, Tweed is the second fast-
est-growing airport in the United States. This 
may only be the start. Under Avports’ master 
plan for its lease from the Airport Authority, 
effective until 2065, the company will invest 
one hundred million dollars into Tweed and 
oversee the construction of a new terminal and 
extension of the runway. 


To Hoey, New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker, 
and most other politicians with a stake in the 
fight, the equation is simple. Tweed brings jobs 
and revenue to the region. Private investment 
from Goldman Sachs-owned Avports pays 
for the venture. Government departments 
oversee permits and regulations to ensure that 
construction is up to federal standards. The 
world carries on, the same as it always has, now 
with six additional flights from New Haven 
to Florida every day. But for residents like 
Gilman-Ford, it’s a world changed. The noise 
that disrupts her sleep, the vegetable garden 
and clotheslines she feels she’s lost access to, 
and the black soot she says covers the outside 
of her house are enough signs of the impact. 
“I don’t care what that study says,” she said, 
speaking about federal environmental impact 
reports. “Because we know, we’re living here.”

For all its rapid growth, Tweed is tiny, 
sitting low down in a large bowl just twelve 
feet above sea level. To get there, drivers exit I-95, 
the main throughway to town, and roll down a 
two-lane road with yellow lines down the middle 
and parking lanes on either side. Only small green 
signs with a white airplane icon and an arrow 
indicate that Tweed is nearby. Single-family 
homes spaced about 15 feet apart with grassy 
lawns line the block. Speed bumps and yard signs 
increase in number closer to the airport: “Keep 
Tweed Small,” they read. On the tarmac, across 
the street and behind the terminal, there’s usually 
at least one purple, white, and yellow Avelo 737 
jet. Morris Creek flows underneath the air traffic 
control tower, underneath the terminal, and down 
the tarmac on the other side.


Tweed Airport is not a new addition to this 
tree-lined New Haven neighborhood. Opened in 
1931 as the New Haven Municipal Airport, it took 
the name Tweed in 1961 from its first manager, 
John H. Tweed. Having purchased the land from 
East Haven in 1931, the City of New Haven fully 
owns the acres that Tweed sits on and leases it to 
the Tweed Airport Authority. The complex also 
crosses into neighboring East Haven, although 
East Haven does not share any financial owner-
ship. Throughout the twentieth century, flight 
offerings shifted as different airlines attempted to 
run routes through New Haven. Due to the short 
length of the runway and small terminal, planes 
were small and flight schedules inconsistent. More 
often than not, passengers chose to fly from New 
York, Hartford, or Westchester instead.


Before 2021, there were not constant 737s at 
Tweed as there are today, which seat up to 120 
passengers; instead, just narrow-bodied airlin-
ers seating about seventy-five people maximum. 
This was due to a 2015 legal battle, where the 
Connecticut government prevented the Airport 
Authority from expanding the length of the 
runway. The move would have allowed for larger 
planes and additional carriers to service Tweed. 
Then, in July 2019, the Second Circuit Court of 
Appeals reversed that decision. 


Rafter, the Executive Director of the 
Airport Authority, keeps a small orange book-
let with the details of the Supreme Court rul-
ing on his desk at his Tweed office. It reminds 
him of past resistance to the airport and the 
avenues through which expansion was still 
able to move forward. 


Rafter, like Hoey, who sits on the board, 
seems unfazed by local opposition to Tweed
