…that summer and the swollen pregnant heat, when Isa 
and I would walk around the house in our underwear and 
spend our water bill in the cavities of those hard plastic ice 
trays, that summer when I had two jobs and there was no 
poetry left in me by sundown, that summer when we’d keep 
the windows cracked open and every Saturday the dirt bikers 
would roar down the road and rattle all of our mismatched 
kitchenware, that summer I let seashells collect on the bath-
room window, that summer I broke the wheels of my parents’ 
best suitcase bringing thirty-five books back to the library, 
that summer I waited for you to drive up to me on the week-
ends, that summer I started a fire by the lake and all of my 
clothes smelled like smoke and clean tobacco, that summer 
the man started following me, that summer the shape of my 
body changed, remember that one?
