I went to the service because I 
wanted to sing hymns. My soph-
omore fall had been a warm one. I 
spent it reading into texts from a girl 
I wanted to be with, drinking purple 
gin and minty tea, and not thinking 
about any higher power. I hadn’t been 
to church since I declared my atheism 
at 13. But then it was December. I was 
alone, and the afternoons were dark. I 
wanted music that sounded like light.


I dragged my friend Lucy to the 
Christmas service on campus. We sat 
on the balcony. Below us, poinsettias 
lined every aisle and window sill. Their 
symmetry pulled the music into a new 
sphere; the air seemed to purr. Before 
“Silent Night,” we watched the light 
unfurl candle by candle, each congre-
gant passing their flame to the next. I 
let wax drip onto my fingertips. We 
pretended not to notice the shake in 
each other’s voices.


After the service, we ate takeout and 
Lucy read me a poem by Ada Limón:
And I think of that walk in the valley where
J said, You don’t believe in God? And I said,
No. I believe in this connection we all have
to nature, to each other, to the universe.
And she said, Yeah, God.


We pasted this into a document 
and named it “religion.” Today it is 
thirty-nine pages long, filled with prose 
and poems written by women we love. 
We add a piece of writing if it makes 
us feel this connection we all have: to 
nature, to each other, to the universe.


I grew up in a small country church, 
sharing hymnals and communion grape 
juice with adults who had been sitting in 
the same pew since childhood. Maybe, as 
we sang together, they were connected—
to nature, each other, the universe. I 
certainly was not. Church taught me to 
remember grown-ups’ names, to speak 
in front of a crowd, to bake muffins for 
coffee hour. But I understood religion 
as something to memorize. I learned 
the Lord’s Prayer as soon as I could read, 
because a cross-stitched reproduction 
was the only thing hanging on the oat-
meal-colored walls, and my eyes longed 
for an interesting place to rest. Each 
spring, at the end of the Sunday school 
year, we recited the titles of the books of 
the Bible before the congregation. I still 
remember the groupings of syllables, but 
I can’t keep track of the order of the clus-
ters. Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes. Joshua 
Judges Ruth. They didn’t mean anything to 
me then; they don’t mean anything to me 
now. Just sounds for my wandering mind 
to chew.


But the scriptures Lucy and I have 
compiled don’t feel like syllables to mem-
orize—not the hollow words of the Lord’s 
Prayer or the repeated books of the Bible. 
Every entry rips my stomach open. 


In March, Lucy and I went to Paris, 
to feel grown up. I dragged her to 
the Sainte-Chapelle to see the stained 
glass. We marched up the shadowy spi-
ral staircase, heaving closer and closer to 
the heavenly glow. But the sky was too 
cloudy. The glass did not glow. We tried 
to parse out the Bible stories told across 
the windows—maybe that, there, could 
be a crucifix?—but we could not orient 
ourselves. We spotted one woman in all 
of the thousands of window panes. I told 
Lucy that the space still felt sacred, but I 
was mostly trying to convince myself.


In the Musée D’Orsay, we looked 
for Berthe Morisot’s oil paintings—she’s 
our favorite. We turned a corner, and our 
breath caught in our throats. In the frame, 
a blonde girl placed flowers into the hair 
of her brunette friend sitting in front of 
her. It was called L’Hortensia and neither 
of us had seen it before. We did not speak. 
We did not need to say aloud that we 
were looking at a picture of us—that we 
were seeing, through Berthe’s paintbrush, 
the tenderness of our friendship. Sacred.


I lived near a Cape Cod beach for 
forty days when I was 19. Every after-
noon, I stood in front of the water and 
waited for the ocean to make me feel 
small, to lull me into a sense of con-
nection to the earth. Every afternoon, I 
thought about the people who had stood 
in front of this same water and felt the 
same smallness, the same connection. 
She believes in the Virgin the way I believe in the mountain,
though in one case the fog never lifts.
But each person stores his hope in a different place.
– Louise Glück
