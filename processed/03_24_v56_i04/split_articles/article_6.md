pop-up vintage markets. “It’s a meet up 
place,” Burrow says. “You have every-
one knowing that there’s this one place 
where they can come together and, you 
know, skate together whenever.”

Community hubs like Plush nat-
urally function as sites for structural 
change, too. As a centralized location for 
skaters, Plush has been instrumental in 
advocating for more skating spaces in 
New Haven. The majority of this advo-
cacy can be tied back to Ben Berkowitz, 
co-owner of Plush.

Since lending a hand to Sablone 
and Thompson in the opening of Plush, 
Berkowitz, who is also a local skater, has 
used the scale of Plush’s wide-reaching 
community as proof to the city of the 
need for more skating locations. He’s 
been successful. Berkowitz worked with 
New Haven and the Parking Authority 
Board to transform Temple Street 
Parking Garage, a formerly unofficial 
skating hub, into an official indoor skate-
park. With his encouragement, city lead-
ers opened Scantlebury Park, a skatepark 
on Ashmun Street, and a new skating 
bowl on George Street in 2021.

However, the preservation of street 
skating, an essential part of skateboard-
ing culture, has been harder to reconcile 
with the city—and with Yale.

While street skating is not techni-
cally illegal in New Haven, it is heav-
ily policed, especially on and around 
Yale’s campus. Beinecke Plaza, a popu-
lar skate spot, is often patrolled by Yale 
Security personnel, and skaters have 
faced backlash—including removal—
for trying to skate it and other parts 
of campus.

“Street skateboarding… it’s kind of 
what makes skateboarding skateboard-
ing,” Burrow says. “The spirit of resilience, 
of getting kicked out and coming back 
is a big portion of street skateboarding. 
Builds character.”

When I walked into Plush, Burrow 
had been laughing with four teenage 
boys, all decked in mostly-black baggy 
jeans and T-shirts. As soon as Burrow 
and I start talking, the boys flee to the 
street. I can still see them outside of 
Plush’s giant window, skating in circles 
around the block. One of the boys comes 
up and taps on the window, making a 
face at Burrow. He laughs.

“I’ve known these kids for a while 
because I’ve been skating out here for a 
few years,” Burrow says. “That’s another 
thing—skating, shops like these, it 
gives the kids a place to go instead of 
a bar or some other time-wasting thing. 
Skating is…it’s freedom. We’re giving 
them that here.” 

I grew up skateboarding. Walking 
into Plush, I was instantly comforted by 
the familiarity of the shop’s environment, 
its palpably laid-back energy. Hip-hop 
music played softly over the loudspeakers 
as the teenagers around the counter 
laughed with Burrow. I could have met 
them in a skatepark back home—they 
were wearing the same outfits that were 
so recognizable to me, and had the same 
quippy way of speaking that felt like a 
constant challenge. Skating not only lib-
erates; it also connects.

Another tap at the window. It’s been 
a few minutes since the last. Same kid—
same face, small and covered by a mop of 
light-brown hair. Burrow’s eyes light up. 
It’s clear that these kids aren’t just shop 
regulars. They’ve become his friends.

Burrow strolls to the door and yells 
out into the chilly February evening. 
“Mead! Get in here.”

The kid—no older than 17—glides 
up to the door and steps in. He’s holding 
a mini, skateboard-shaped fidget toy. He 
comes up to me at the counter and gives 
me a nod. The fidget skateboard flips in 
his fingers.

Mead taps his foot on the ground. 
“Are you a student?”

When I nod my head yes, he looks at 
Burrow and takes a deep breath.

Mead has been skating for six years. 
“Not that long,” he assures me. His ter-
rain is the street, not the parks. Echoing 
Burrow’s reflection on the power of street 
skating, he tells me that street skating 
preserves skating culture.

“A lot of people that don’t skate 
assume it’s all about the parks, but 
skating started on the street, it’s meant 
for the street,” he tells me. “Street skat-
ing is something you can learn from. 
You need dedication for it. It’s escapism. 
I use it to cope.”

For the first time in our conversation, 
he makes direct eye contact with me. 
“You go to Yale?”

I nod. 

Yale’s Schwarzman Center has 
funneled thousands of dollars into 
local skatepark construction, including 
Scantlebury Park’s and the skate bowl 
on George Street. While the main 
publicized reason for this funding has 
been to support the cultural benefits of 
skateboarding, Mead thinks that the 
popularity of Beinecke Plaza as a skate 
spot acts as a secondary motivation. 

“I’ve been wanting to tell some-
one this, so Yale should hear it. They 
have power,” he says. He flips his fid-
get skateboard on the counter. “Just 
because the city and Yale keep build-
ing these skateparks and stuff doesn’t 
mean that they change anything for us 
street skaters. Pouring money into that 
isn’t going to change the fact that we’re 
going to skate Beinecke.”

He articulates his final point with 
a passion that differs from his earlier 
drawl: “And if they really want us to stay 
off their property, don’t build the skate-
parks outside. Like, centralize it in the 
city. It’s a trek to get to the parks.”

He’s not wrong. The closest park 
to Plush is Scantlebury Park, located 
behind Pauli Murray College off of 
Ashmun Street. It’s a twenty-five-min-
ute walk from Plush’s centralized, down-
town location.

The next day, I make the journey up 
to Scantlebury, located off the Canal 
Trail. My jacket barely keeps me warm 
against the frigid wind. It beats at my 
face as I navigate the icy sidewalk. The 
playground next to the skatepark is, 
unsurprisingly, empty. As I trek up the 
short hill that leads to the base of the 
park, though, I can hear the click of 
wheels against asphalt. The only person 
within eyesight is a single skateboarder 
practicing tricks on the slopes.

His name is Michael Skirkanich. 
He’s middle-aged, definitely older than 
the kids I saw at Plush. Unlike them, he’s 
wearing a helmet. “Don’t want to crack 
my head open,” he says. When I sit down 
on the concrete next to the 
skatepark, we begin to talk 
about Scantlebury. 

“I like being out here 
alone,” he tells me. “When 
I’m here, I don’t care about, 
think about anything else. 
It’s 
just 
skateboarding. 
Without the squirts—the 
teens—I can focus.”

As we’re talking, he 
pauses every so often to 
focus on a particular trick 
or flip. “I come out here 
seven, eight hours a day,” he 
explains. “I see every day as 
a good day or a training day.”

Unlike 
Mead, 
the 
skatepark is an essential 
space for Michael. It pro-
vides a structured space for 
him to focus on the “artistic” 
side of his skating craft.

After all, to him, skate-
boarding is, in one word, 
self-fulfillment. “Not many 
people can do this, and 
that fulfills me. Landing 
a trick, the sound, it’s like 
music, it fills me up.” 

Music. He’s right. I’m 
reminded again of my own 
skating roots. I used to love 
the musicality of the sport, the rhythm of 
the wheels. I think that, in a strange way, 
my yearning for that feeling was what 
made me so interested in the presence 
of skateboarding on every street in New 
Haven—one of the first things I noticed 
about the city was how much skating 
was embedded into its culture. At street 
corners and in parks, on campus and off, 
there are skaters. The sound of wheels on 
asphalt is an essential part of the urban 
melody of my new home.

I stopped skateboarding when I was 
15 because of a shoelace-in-wheel trip 
that left me in an arm cast for a month. 
Sitting criss-cross on the side of the 
curving, concrete slopes, I tell Skirkanich 
this. I tell him about the weird fear I 
have of stepping on a board now, about 
how it reminds me of the crack I heard—
and the instant shoot of pain I felt—four 
years ago when I last did it. He scoffs.

“You’re telling me you broke your 
wrist four years ago and haven’t gotten 
back on a board? I broke my ankle. I’m 
here,” he says. I’m reminded of Burrow’s 
point: that skating is all about resil-
ience. You just have to keep going for 
it. Skirkanich echoes him. “You have to 
keep trying, keep going for it.”

“Come stand on my board and you’ll 
see,” he says. “You gotta try.” 
He waves me over, kicks his board 
towards me. “It’s all about baby steps.”

I balance myself on his board. 
He holds his arm out. “Hey, it’s nice. 
Mercedes of skateboards. Be careful,” he 
makes sure to let me know. For the first 
time in a long while, I feel the libera-
tion of skating. How it is freedom, like 
Burrow told me, how it is self-fulfill-
ment, like Michael tells me, and I get it. 
It clicks.

Back at Plush, Burrow left me with 
some words that pretty much sum it up. 
“New Haven, skating, music, culture, film, 
they all go hand in hand,” Burrow told 
me. “Skating is art. It needs to be treated 
like art. It needs to be respected like art.” 
Art on the street—art in the park. 
Both go hand in hand. Skateboarding, 
as art, is an inherently public sport. It 
deserves space both in structured envi-
ronments and in the city at large. 
Stand on a board like I did, and 
maybe you’ll get it too. ∎
