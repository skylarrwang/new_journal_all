to their communities, choosing VITA 
because of its ability to make a tangible 
difference in other’s lives.
“The money that people are getting 
back makes a huge impact,” Co-President 
Zhang shared. 
VITA sends emails to its volunteers 
every day the site operates, Monday 
through Saturday, for about nine weeks 
until Tax Day on April 15. Each email 
includes a red number—the amount of 
money that taxpayers owed that day—
and a green number, which is always sig-
nificantly larger and denotes the amount 
of money that was returned to clients.
VITA volunteers strive to express 
sensitivity, respect, and understand-
ing, especially when a client finds out 
they owe money or that their return 
is not as sizable as they had expected. 
Zhang recalled instances when she had 
to explain to people why their returns 
were smaller than they expected, espe-
cially after pandemic-era expansions 
of the Child Tax Credit expired. This 
thoughtfulness seemed attuned 
to navigating the vulnerabil-
ity required of clients and the 
responsibility given to volun-
teers on the VITA site.
Every VITA program abides 
by the IRS prescribed structure. 
Clients fill out an intake sheet, 
bringing their Social Security 
card, an official form of iden-
tification, and all relevant tax 
documents to the site. The VITA 
volunteer reviews these mate-
rials, inputting data into the 
online tax preparation system 
“TaxSlayer,” which automatically 
calculates the return. Before 
submission, each return is dou-


ble-checked by a different vol-
unteer. Filing is often simple, as 
volunteers are limited in scope 
and unauthorized to prepare for 
taxpayers with specific, compli-
cated situations. But volunteers 
still need to know the right 
questions to ask. For example, 
if a volunteer misidentifies the 
filing status of an individual 
as “single,” instead of “head of 
household,” the taxpayer may 
miss out on certain benefits. 
Volunteers must understand the 
basics of tax law and be prepared 
to explain returns to clients. 
The Volunteer Standards 
of Conduct Agreement, signed 
by all VITA volunteers, reminds 
volunteers that “fraudulent returns that 
report incorrect income, credits, or 
deductions can result in many years of 
interaction with the IRS as the taxpayer 
tries to pay the additional tax plus 
interest and penalties. ” 


Training Volunteers
O
ver the previous fall semester, 
I watched the five training video 
modules ranging from twenty min-
utes to an hour that Yale student VITA 
leaders created, touching on the fun-
damentals of tax law. 
In January, I walked into a lec-
ture hall for VITA’s “Certification 
Party,” a gathering to pass the IRS’s 
official certification exams. Although 
the exam is taken individually online, 
organizers talked through exam ques-
tions in groups, eventually giving each 
volunteer the correct answers and 
officially qualifying all participants 
to volunteer on an IRS VITA site. The 
exam guidelines instruct volunteers 
to take the test individually, noting 
that “taking the test in groups or 
with outside assistance is a disservice 
to the customers you volunteered to 
help.”  However, three out of four of 
the VITA sites I have interacted with 
approach the test similarly, in groups 
with correct answers eventually pro-
vided to all volunteers.
Computers out, we gathered in 
groups 
according 
to 
certification 
levels, which ranged from “Intake 
Coordinator” to “Basic Preparer” to 
“Advanced Preparer.” A veteran VITA 
volunteer, one of the site coordina-
tors, prompted individuals from my 
group to read the exam questions 
aloud while soliciting answers from the 
group. I strained to hear amongst the 
echo of the tall, domed ceiling, hushed 
voices, and the hum of other groups’ 
discussions. We breezed through the 
exam. When tougher questions made 
the group pause, some students opted 
to switch tabs on their computers to 
Publication 4012, the official Volunteer 
Resource Guide. While they searched 
for official guidance as a volunteer 
would be expected to do on a VITA site, 
others sat quietly and waited to be told 
the correct answer.
When I asked Theo Schiminovich 
’25, a new volunteer with VITA, about his 
level of confidence going into his first 
session, he paused, choosing his words 
carefully. “I feel like I’m gonna need to 
work up to it,” he said. “I’m in the stage 
right now where I don’t really know what 
it’s going to look like, so I have this void 
in my mind.” 
Before preparing returns inde-
pendently, new volunteers shadow expe-
rienced ones. Co-President Wypasek 
described the steps after shadowing as 
“a gentle push towards doing it on your 
own.” She added, “we try to also give 
them the tools so that if they’re stuck, 
they know what to do next.” Volunteers 
can search the IRS website or the offi-
cial Volunteer Resource Guide, ask 
fellow volunteers questions, and check 
in with their IRS point of contact. In 
daily emails, leaders share lessons 
learned and keep a running document 
of common questions. As new volun-
teers build their confidence on the job, 
capacity is limited early on in the tax 
season. Wypasek alluded to this bottle-
neck, warning, “the first week might be 
very very hectic.”


Waiting On Site
n the first day of VITA’s operation, 
I stood next to Andrea Santiago-Tito 
SOM ’24. We met in the waiting room; she 
has used VITA for six years.
“I come here every year because I 
don’t trust going to other companies and 
other environments,” Santiago-Tito said. 
“I feel the Yale students, we have this trust 
where, they know what they’re doing.”
On the NHFPL flier, the down-
town branch is listed plainly among 
other NHFPL VITA locations and does 
not advertise its affiliation with Yale 
students. Sitting among the clients, I 
noticed how the students seemed like 
the youngest people on site, with their 
stickered laptops and backpacks.
Santiago-Tito and I watched the 
waiting area fill up the middle of the 
library basement. Earlier, I had wit-
nessed a public argument between a pair 
of clients who were worried about what 
order they would be seen in. The library 
staff and security guards, milling around 
in reflective layers, diffused the conflict. 
“I’m not in a rush to just be first, as 
long as I get it done,” Santiago-Tito 
said. I turned my head to the rustling 
of coats in the waiting area as people 
stood. Santiago-Tito bolted, securing a 
space in the rapidly forming line. 
Santiago-Tito was number nine-
teen among twenty-two taxpayers who 
were taken that day. VITA volunteers 
are not allowed to stay after the library 
closes, so they preemptively limit the 
number of clients they will see in a 
day. When I asked Costa, the librar-
ian, about the walk-in format of the 
site, he explained that a format blended 
between appointments and walk-ins 
functioned less efficiently, as appoint-
ments were often missed, leav-
ing volunteers with nothing to 
do. Costa told me that volun-
teers averaged twenty-eight 
to thirty-three people every 
three-and-a-half-hour session.
On the last day of the site’s 
first week, I returned to the 
waiting area and sat down next 
to Clevetta, an older woman 
bundled in her winter coat, hat, 
and gloves. She told me that 
she had attempted to come 
the day before but had been 
turned away. This time, one of 
the library security guards was 
tasked with handing out num-
bered index cards to denote 
those who would make the cut 
for a session. 
“It’s comparable to H&R 
Block, in my book.” Clevetta 
remarked. “They’re always thor-
ough, always helpful, always 
introducing themselves, and 
very knowledgeable.”
I asked her whether she 
had faced long wait times 
before. As we spoke, others 
who were waiting began to notice that 
the index cards had been given out of 
order, confusing who was to be seen 
first. Clevetta responded, “No, I’ve been 
lucky I suppose, or blessed that when 
I come it’s...” she paused. “This is the 
first time I’ve seen this many people.” I 
chalked the chaos up to first week grow-
ing pains. Another woman sat down 
next to us, joining the conversation. In 
hushed voices, they exchanged stories of 
the ways companies like H&R Block and 
Jackson Hewitt had taken their money, 
tax season after tax season. 
Four hours later, I returned from 
class to the library and was surprised to 
see familiar faces, including Clevetta, 
rearranged into different configurations 
around the room. The Yale students, 
meanwhile, were transitioning to their 
third personnel shift of the day. I sat down 
next to a pair of women talking, playfully 
analyzing the volunteers’ actions. I asked 
them about how long they had been 
waiting. One responded, “they take their 
time, that’s why it takes so long and that’s 
why people get frustrated and get aggra-
vated, but they gonna make sure they do 
it right.” Between those who were wait-
ing, a friendly camaraderie formed. Small 
conversation and laughter emerged often, 
disrupting the long stretches of waiting 
that characterized the site. 
I stood to leave again, wishing them 
good luck. One man tried to get me to 
stay and wait for my taxes to be complete. 
“They’ll get them done for you,” he insisted. 
I smiled, explaining that I was a student, 
writing a story about the site. “I knew 
you had that student look about you” he 
quipped. I chuckled, waving goodbye. 
When I returned to the VITA site 
for a third time during its second week 
of operation, the waiting chairs were 
already filled. All twenty-one numbered 
index cards had been passed out accord-
ing to arrival time. The site would not be 
accepting anyone new that day. As the 
clients stood, I watched them arrange 
themselves into a neat line between the 
stanchions. I wondered if it was like this 
all tax season: demand high, the atmo-
sphere thick with waiting, and the site at 
full capacity. ∎
