Dear readers,
There are a lot of ways to say goodbye. The poets have tried. Louise Bogan 
calls it “leave-taking.” Emily Brontë reminds us to “follow out the happiest 
story.” Perhaps Yvor Winters puts it best: “This is the terminal, the break.” 
Here we are, at the terminal of our tenure, and there’s not much else to do 
but wave.

This issue holds a lot of goodbyes. In our cover story, Meg Buzbee explores 
the pain of saying goodbye to a quiet neighborhood taken over by airport 
turbulence. Chloe Nguyen explores Connecticut’s new ethnic studies elective 
and helps us bid farewell to the history curriculum of the past. We have 
other, smaller goodbyes—odes to the farmland that borders our city campus, 
farewells to staying quiet in spoken word poetry. A goodbye to home and all 
of its food, to the expenses of the year, to churches and summer and loved 
ones.

In our last issue as a managing board, we felt these farewells in everything 
we did: our last pitch meeting, our last production weekend, our last design 
proofing all-nighter. Our farewell isn’t unique. When we started our tenure 
as a board, we read over letters of advice from boards before ours and 
combed through their challenges. This February, we wrote our own letters. 
They are also a form of farewell, one that means we will be there for you. 
We’re trying to think of this not as a goodbye but as a see you later. We can’t 
wait to see what our next board does, and the next one, and the next. This 
journal is as good as our lineage. We’ll be waiting when the plane lands.

With TNJ love always,
Abbey, Jabez, Paola, & Kylie
