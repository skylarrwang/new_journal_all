T
he first time i go to the Yale Farm, 
I am reminded of Marie Antoinette 
and Le Hameau de la Reine, the 
ornamental village she built outside 
Versailles. She would put on her best peas-
ant dress and wander between the dove-
cote and the dairy, where it is said (alas, 
apocryphally) that she enjoyed milking 
goats adorned with ribbons. This is not an 
exact analogy for the farm, but it’s pretty 
close, I think, locking my bike to a lamp-
post. Yale students, too, sometimes stray 
from their castles to spend an afternoon 
picking vegetables they did not plant. 
The farm is about a mile from the 
center of Yale’s campus, past the man-
sions on Hillhouse Avenue and the old 
laboratories on Prospect Street. It occu-
pies almost an acre of university grounds, 
tightly planted with rows of vegetables 
and herbs. The farm has no buildings, 
just a wooden pavilion that protects its 
red-brick pizza oven and picnic tables 
from the elements. 
Property Manager Jeremy Oldfield 
waves from his riding mower as I cut 
uphill toward the middle of the farm. 
I wave back and wait for him under 
the pavilion. We’re several days into 
a scorching September heatwave, but 
it’s not yet 10 a.m. and the farm is still 
cool and dewy. The last of the late sum-
mer light pours out onto the apple trees, 
the rows of squash and corn, the ragged 
bed of wildflowers that separates the 
farm from the street. Up here, if the sky 
is right, you can see all the way to the 
Long Island Sound. 
“This is an interesting hillside we’re 
sitting on,” Jeremy says. Before it was 
a farm, the land belonged to William 
Whitman Farnam, a member of the 
Yale Corporation who lived at the top 
of the hill. When Farnam died in 1929, 
his widow promised their estate to Yale 
on the condition that the university 
wouldn’t build on the land, devoting 
it instead to the study of plants. The 
hillside was largely ignored until 2000, 
when a band of students called “Food 
from the Earth” began lobbying to turn 
it into a farm. Their cause was taken up 
by Alice Waters—a Yale parent and the 
grand dame of California’s farm-to-ta-
ble scene—who talked then-university 
president Richard Levin into the idea. 
Students broke ground on the farm in 
the spring of 2003, nicknaming it the 
Old Acre. 
“The myth was that the students 
came under the cover of darkness 
with chainsaws,” Jeremy tells me. 
“Everything needs a nice, dramatic cre-
ation myth.” Jeremy is 41, with sandy 
hair and a big laugh. He spent years 
farming in Maine and California, but 
the Yale Farm is unlike any he’s worked 
at before. Most of its crops are selected 
not for their ability to feed a family 
or turn a profit, but because they’re 
“narratively interesting,” he says. Last 
year, Jeremy and his student employ-
ees planted a field illustrating several 
centuries of grain evolution; this year, 
they’re growing indigo for an art class 
studying the history of dye production. 
It’s the farm’s capacity for story-
telling that interests student manager 
Calista Washburn ’24. I meet her on a 
golden evening after one of the farm’s 
weekly open workdays. We sit in the 
grass under an apple tree, watching fat 
white hens peck inside a coop a few 
yards away. When a group of soph-
omores comes over to ask if they’re 
allowed to pick the apples, she gently 
tells them that no, the farm is saving 
them for a Russian literature class read-
ing a play with an extended fruit-pick-
ing metaphor, but they’re welcome to 
any that have already fallen. 
“There’s hilarious impracticalities 
here,” Calista says, laughing as she tells 
me about how much time students on 
the farm spend hand-weeding the veg-
etables and about the week they used 
tiny scythes to harvest wheat. “It totally 
changed the way I understood history 
and technology and feeding people.”
Here, she explains, there are no 
boundaries between the dirt of the real 
world and the ideas taught down the 
hill. There are also no physical boundar-
ies between the farm and the rest of Yale, 
no locked gates or requirements for entry. 
This is why Calista has recently become 
so concerned about the deer, who have 
been grazing on the farm’s sweet potato 
plants in droves since the beginning of 
the summer. A commercial farm might 
shoot the deer or scare them off with 
deafening sound alarms, but neither of 
these are feasible options on a college 
campus. The Yale Farm has discussed
