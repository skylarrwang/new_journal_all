EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
keeping the deer out with an 8-foot fence, 
the kind of barrier that it has intention-
ally resisted for its twenty years of exis-
tence. Jeremy tells me a fence could go 
up as early as this spring, but there is still 
no definite plan in place. 


The two other student farm manag-
ers I speak to both independently bring 
up the dilemma with the deer. “It’s this 
crisis moment,” one of them, Natalie 
Smink ’24, tells me emphatically. But 
when I talk to Jeremy about it, he doesn’t 
seem too concerned. The students will 
find a way to protect the sweet pota-
toes, and if that means building a fence 
around the farm, then they’ll find new 
ways of inviting people in. This is one of 
the farm’s true purposes, he tells me: to 
provide students who are used to study-
ing ideas in the abstract with tangible 
problems to solve. 


“You’ll go through a bed of carrots 
that is wild and wooly with three differ-
ent types of weeds, and by the end of the 
workday it is legibly a carrot bed,” Jeremy 
says. “You find students kind of lingering 
there, in front of this living physical testa-
ment of the work that they just did.”


And even after only a few hours on 
the farm, I believe him. Because per-
haps this is what all of us, even Marie 
Antoinette, are doing: searching in the 
dirt for something that feels alive and 
real and good. ∎
