t’s a full house in the gym of High 
School in the Community. Tennis 
shoes squeak as students file into silver 
rows of bleachers. The air fills with the 
chatter of three hundred high schoolers 
left to their own devices.

In front of the crowd is Keiantae, a 
16-year-old student rapper about to per-
form at his school’s Black History Month 
pep rally. 

“I try not to really look at people 
because when I do I get nervous,” he told 
me after the show.

But this time, Keiantae can’t resist. 
As he gazes up from the shiny linoleum 
flooring, he is met with hundreds of eyes.

Giving a nod to the sound technician, 
Keiantae takes a deep breath and grips 
the mic.

Keiantae isn’t just any rapper, he’s a 
student poet. He’s been honing his craft 
in The Word, a literary arts program that 
has operated for twelve years in New 
Haven. The Word’s goal is to facilitate 
a radically inclusive writing and perfor-
mance environment grounded in poetry, 
rap, and song. Every week, the group 
hosts “Writing Liberation Workshops” 
at the Neighborhood Music School—
the group’s home base—and in-class 
poetry workshops in New Haven Public 
Schools, where students receive guid-
ance on crafting poetry.

It is these workshops that brought 
me to Keiantae one winter morning 
in the “Introduction to Poetry” class of 
MarcAnthony Solli ’91.


Keiantae is part of a new initiative 
by The Word. He is one of four New 
Haven Public School teens selected 
for a program that trains and hires stu-
dents to become Teaching Artists like 
Tarishi. The fourteen-week program, 
which pays students $25 an hour during 
training, offers hands-on experiences 
led by mentors. Participants learn 
how to create course curriculums, lead 
workshops, and gel with other students 
in the program. These skills prepare 
them to eventually serve as indepen-
dent teaching artists in New Haven.

When I asked him about his class-
room’s partnership with The Word, 
High School in the Community 
teacher 
MarcAnthony 
could 
not 
understate its importance. 
“It is nothing short of curriculum 
changing…allowing the curriculum to 
become a living, tangible, real thing for 
students where they see someone per-
forming at the highest level of their art,” 
he says. “And that it is accessible. Right in 
front of them. Right down the street on 
Audubon Street.” 

Keiantae sees The Word as a space to 
engage with his art and process hardship. 
 “New Haven is basically a place you 
want to get out of,” Keiantae said. “In 
order for me to make New Haven bet-
ter, something’s gotta give, something’s 
gotta change.”

Keiantae first started rapping at the 
age of 12 after the loss of his father to 
gun violence.

“I rap about the minor setbacks to 
a major comeback,” Keiantae said. This 
adage seems to also be the theme of 
The Word. 

On the first day we met, Tarishi 
and I sat across from each other in the 
Neighborhood Music School, about 
a mile away from High School in the 
Community. Students meet here weekly 
to practice for poetry slams and partic-
ipate in Writing Liberation Workshops. 
The day I visited was different 
than usual. The snack bowl of Goldfish, 
pretzels, and other goodies was still 
full. In the room, no one was there 
but me, Tarishi, and one student poet, 
Maximilian, who was also experiencing 
The Word for the first time.

Low turnout has plagued The Word 
since the start of the pandemic. “A lot of 
people have been struggling with after-
school programs,” Tarishi said, sliding me 
a pack of gummies. COVID-19 has imposed 
hardships on previous attendees of The 
Word: students lack the time to make art 
as they scramble to find jobs to support 
families—not to mention the anxiety that 
comes with moving out of social isolation 
and trying to resume “normal” life with 
face-to-face interactions. 

“But I feel like we are making a lot 
of progress and strides in the in-school 
workshops,” he said, referencing the 
in-class poetry workshops that The 
Word currently leads in eight public 
middle and high schools in New Haven.

In freezing weather, teens crept into 
class. Icy shoes scuffled along wooden 
floorboards as the first bell of the school 
day rang. One final student walked in 
late and found a seat in the back, a crum-
pled brown bag of McDonald’s peeking 
out from his backpack.

Shortly after, Tarishi “M.I.D.N.I.G.H.T.” 
Schuler entered, dressed in bright crimson 
red glasses and a hoodie to match. Tarishi 
is the current artistic director of The Word 
and the leader of that day’s poetry workshop. 
“M.I.D.N.I.G.H.T. is a pseudonym,” he 
told me. “It’s an acronym for a name I 
gave myself in my late teens. It stands for 
‘Messiah Is Dominant Now Inspired God 
Helps Tarishi.’ I was born in 1976 when 
Alex Haley came out with Roots and a lot of 
parents were naming their children African 
names…I didn’t know until my early thir-
ties, my name Tarishi is Swahili for ‘mes-
senger.’ So I ended up being a poet not 
knowing that’s what my name meant.”

Tarishi, unfazed by the yawning 
class of sleepy high schoolers, asked for 
everyone in the room to stand. Chairs 
squeaked, heads rose, and shoulders 
slouched across the classroom as fifteen 
pairs of groggy eyes turned toward the 
smiling poet.

“Repeat after me,”  Tarishi said before 
clearing his throat. “MEeeeee, MIiiiiii, 
MOOooooooooo!”

Giggles and laughs fluttered through 
the air as the students exchanged amused 
glances. This wasn’t what they had expected. 
“He brings life to his poems,” one of 
the high school students told me after 
class. “His personality is contagious!” 
another said.

The mood shifted. One by one, stu-
dents shared their own poems, greeted 
with applause from the rest of the class. 
Tarishi let the students put on their best 
“poetry-writing music” on the class com-
puter, which the kids used as an opportu-
nity to suggest their favorite new TikTok 
songs. Students raised their hands ner-
vously, then quickly lowered them when 
Tarishi jokingly cold-called them to pres-
ent. If students were too nervous (which 
they often were), Tarisihi recited his own 
poems first.

Keiantae sat quietly in the back of 
the classroom. His hoodie hid two clan-
destine white AirPods looping the drill 
beat to his newest poem titled “I Have a 
Dream” for the upcoming pep rally.

“M.I.D.N.I.G.H.T.’s a cool dude, and 
he’s so into it. I can’t explain it,” Keiantae 
told me. “It’s like he brings a different type 
of energy, and I mess with it.”

Back in the gym of High School in 
the Community, students rise from their 
seats. Bodies sway and phones flash to 
the beat. Keiantae looks out to a sea of 
sparkling lights. As he raps the lyrics he 
perfected in The Word’s in-class work-
shop, he announces: “Alright, now I know 
that y’all mess with it. Let me really give 
y’all a show.” ∎
