Student organizers, serc, and their Advisory 
Group felt that pushing for all schools to require 
the course would have placed excessive pressure on 
its broader school districts. This is especially true in 
light of Connecticut’s recent amendments to high 
school graduation requirements, where students 
need to obtain twenty-five credits instead of twenty 
credits to graduate. Legislators and organizers hesi-
tated to impose further changes on schools.


With the course ultimately being an elective, 
however, the educators I spoke with were concerned 
that not all students can make room to take it. 
“Electives compete with other classes for stu-
dents,” said Ben Scudder, who teaches the course at 
High School in the Community. “Students are pick-
ing between this and P.E. or art.” 
Moreover, they voiced concerns that it would 
self-select students with prior interest instead of 
those who already felt disconnected from the mate-
rial. Throughout the New Haven school district, 89 
percent of students identify as non-white, with 48.1 
percent of all students identifying as Hispanic or 
Latino and another 35 percent identifying as Black or 
African American.


Jessie Piper, who teaches the class at Metro 
Business Academy, noted varying levels of interest 
in the course. Piper told me not all students in her 
class take it on their own accord; some are placed by 
guidance counselors for scheduling purposes. “I’m 
worried that the people who don’t care will weigh 
down the people who do care,” she said. Moreover, 
the class was designed to be inclusive to students of 
all learning levels, so some students with less prior 
knowledge might have to learn the material at a 
faster pace than others. 
Still, each of the four classrooms I visited had 
students who attested to the value of the course.


Borowski’s junior students at Co-Op affirmed 
the class’s in-depth nature. Farida I., one student, 
spoke on the curriculum’s ability to transform chal-
lenging topics into accessible ones. “It’s a mix of 
jokes,” Farida said. “Then we get into the serious stuff, 
then we cool down and discuss.”


Drew S., a sophomore in Piper’s class at Metro, 
found the second-semester curriculum especially 
rewarding. Growing up Black in the South, she had 
accumulated a knowledge of Black American history 
but had received less exposure to Latino culture. She 
cited the Mexico-U.S. border system, Christianity’s 
diffusion throughout Latin America, and the tenu-
ous relationship between Puerto Rico and the U.S. 
as crucial facts the course had taught her. 
But Drew also expressed confusion on why 
this cultural history course was separated from 
the core U.S. History curriculum. “It’s kinda 
ridiculous that we even have to have this class 
when this history is literally American history,” 
she said. “Why is this not just a part of the reg-
ular history curriculum? It’s like they’re othering 
[people of color]. It’s like ‘This is the history, and 
there’s no room for you.’”


I  
visited A’Lexus Williams’s classroom at Hill 
Regional Career High School the same day I vis-
ited Borowski’s classroom: February 1, coincidentally 
the first day of Black History Month.


That day, Williams had created a presentation 
for the last unit of the first semester, “Protest, Politics, 
and Power (1965-Present).” It included songs like 
Sam Cooke’s “Change is Gonna Come” and Marvin 
Gaye’s “What’s Goin’ On,” and a 1964 speech by 
Martin Luther King Jr. 
Williams weaved through every corner of her 
large classroom to address her eleven students. She 
moderated the discussion closely, but many of her 
students were excited to jump in.


Williams, who is Black, confidently projected 
to her class of entirely Black and brown students. 
On the whiteboard, she defined the word radical 
and said: “The audaciousness for Black people, free 
and enslaved, to call for the abolishment of a sys-
tem that had been sustained for hundreds of years 
was considered radical.”


Wesley R., a senior in Williams’s class, felt the 
class was more freeing than the fast-paced STEM lec-
tures he was used to. “Our ideas just come out, and 
we talk based on what a peer might say,” he said. “In 
other classes, we’re quiet unless a teacher picks on us.”


Later that same day, Borowski and his stu-
dents conducted their final debate of the semester, 
projected in front of the room: “Were John Brown 
and Nat Turner American martyrs/heroes or ter-
rorists?” Through laughter and earnest deliberation, 
Borowski’s students all participated in the assign-
ment with uniform engagement and enthusiasm.


On the same day, following the same state 
guidelines, Williams and Borowski taught two dif-
ferent classes in two different styles. 
“We offer and guide [Connecticut schools] to 
follow the course and follow [its] fidelity,” SERC’s 
Jarman-Smith told me. “But school districts have to 
make it theirs.”


A few years prior to teaching this course put 
forth by SERC, Borowski and his colleagues had been 
asked by Co-Op principal Paul Camarco to develop 
and teach a class on African American and Black 
history. Borowski developed the course, which he 
recalled teaching from 2017 until 2021, by asking his 
students what they envisioned. The result empha-
sized modern figures and events, a practice that he 
has carried into implementing SERC’s program. 
“[Students’] personal experiences tend to relate 
more to current events and injustices,” Borowski said, 
“police brutality, mass incarceration, war on drugs…” 
Straying from the statewide curriculum, 
Borowski asks his students to research examples 
of modern-day slavery or the stories of unheralded 
Americans like queer activist Marsha P. Johnson. 
He wants his students to discover what makes 
them curious, and what makes them uncomfort-
able: “If you give students meaningful choice 
[over] what they learn, they’re more likely to take 
ownership of their learning.”

This style seemed to resonate with some of his 
students. “[The content] is not just facts and dates, 
which don’t connect with me easily,” Juliet S., a 
senior in Borowski’s class, said. “We talk about the 
mistakes of the past.”


This standardized curriculum can look so differ-
ent between two schools in part because following 
SERC’s program in its entirety can be overly ambi-
tious for educators.


“The curriculum is so dense [and] pacing in the 
curriculum underestimates certain lessons,” Williams 
said. Scudder and Piper agreed that it is infeasible to 
cover all the content in one year.


As a consequence, teachers have assumed the lib-
erty to modify lesson plans according to their educa-
tional interests and understanding of their students’ 
learning paces. “I’m looking at it as a course that 
opens a lot of opportunities,” Scudder said. “It’s not 
beholden to anything; there’s no AP exam at the end.”


The class looks different everywhere. Teachers 
facilitating the course throughout New Haven pub-
lic schools don’t communicate directly—when asked 
if they knew anyone else who taught the course, the 
teachers I spoke to struggled to come up with a name 
from any of New Haven’s nine public high schools. 
According to Williams, the history departments 
across the schools meet once a month for only an 
hour. There is no set time for the African American/
Black and Puerto Rican/Latino studies teachers to 
meet. As a result, the program can vary in content, 
pacing, and methodology from county to county, 
school to school, classroom to classroom. 
Despite this lack of inter-district communication 
and consistency, Williams noted a shared experience 
among teachers in the district. “We’re definitely on 
the same page on how dense [the program] is, but 
we have to do what is in the best interest of who is 
in front of us.”


Public Act No. 19-12 does not mandate an 
additional certification for teachers to instruct 
the course—any high school social studies teacher 
can teach it. But in its public digital copy of the 
curriculum, SERC publishes hyperlinks to databases, 
articles, and activity lesson plans. It also hosts a sum-
mer institute, quarterly trainings, and an end-of-year 
showcase to prepare teachers and track progress.


Williams opted to attend a professional develop-
ment seminar hosted by the Anti-Racist Teaching 
& Learning Collective (ARTLC). The initiative is 
a collaboration between Yale professor Daniel 
HoSang; Students for Educational Justice; Hearing 
Youth Voices, a youth activism group based in New 
London; and local educators. Members of ARTLC 
had expressed a wide array of concerns about the 
bill: that it would mandate an inflexible curriculum 
that would “displace existing teacher-developed 
courses,” fail to prepare teachers, employ ineffec-
tive and impersonal methodology, and silo African 
American and Latino Studies with each semester’s 
structure. ARTLC offers solutions in their anti-bias 
and anti-racist oriented teaching guides, lesson 
plans, webinars, and in-person seminars for those 
teaching the course.


Williams acknowledged how ARTLC’s resources 
help empower teachers to feel comfortable having 
the difficult conversations that emerge from course 
questions. “Having that [professional development] 
allowed my white colleagues to think it is okay to 
maybe say the wrong thing,” Williams said. “Now 
they know how to move forward. We’re not gonna 
get into that white defensiveness.”


Scudder and Piper also mentioned finding 
these resources through colleagues and friends who 
were already involved in ARTLC. Similarly, Borowski 
expressed taking additional steps to learn beyond 
the scope of SERC’s recommended training, such as 
researching books to include in his lessons, like Dear 
Martin by Nic Stone and The House on Mango Street 
by Sandra Cisneros. 
“Training is like ‘Let’s go through the curricu-
lum in a week,’” said Scudder. He said the difficulty 
of the topics is not matched by the quality of train-
ing, which largely reiterates SERC’s publicly available 
material. To him, this cannot sufficiently compensate 
for every background discrepancy. “I didn’t major in 
Black or Latino history,” he said. “I majored in politi-
cal science…There needs to be a greater discussion of 
what this class will look like.” 


The deeply personal themes of the course, 
paired with varied implementation and levels 
of training, mean that student experience depends 
more than usual on who is teaching and how.  
While 89 percent of the students in New Haven 
Public Schools are non-white, only 28 percent of 
teachers are non-white. Williams was the only non-
white teacher I spoke with.


This discrepancy is no anomaly in the history of 
New Haven Public Schools. N’Sumbu said she never 
had a Black teacher in her time at Co-Op. Drew 
added that the students are aware of this disparity: 
“Especially with the history that we know between 
white people and Black and brown people, it feels 
questionable at times to have a majority Black and 
brown school and basically, all the staff be white.”


This divide is not lost on the history and social 
studies teachers of New Haven. Borowski said that for 
his class’s first discussion, he wrote a question on the 
board: “How do you feel about having a white teacher 
teach this class?” While he received a mixture of posi-
tive, neutral, and negative responses, Borowski took the 
opportunity to hear his students and, together, negoti-
ate best practices for learning heavy content.


Juliet, who is Persian and one of the few stu-
dents in Borowski’s classroom to not identify as 
Black or Latino, told me, “Borowski makes it very 
clear that we all have a voice here.”


Piper had also welcomed the subject into her 
classroom. “You’re white and why are you teaching 
this class?” she tells me her stu-
dents have asked. She says she 
responds: “It’s history, and you 
don’t have to personally live his-
tory to talk about it.”


One of Piper’s senior stu-
dents, Alysian M., said she’s 
glad that Piper is the one to 
teach the course. Alysian iden-
tifies as a biracial trans lesbian, 
or, as she puts it: “a lot of dif-
ferent identities hodgepodge 
together.” Alysian sees her own 
history in the course, in discus-
sions of struggle ranging from 
African American history to 
the Haitian Revolution.


“Learning 
about 
[slavery] 
makes me feel closer to history 
and people around the world and 
struggling with an oppressor,” 
she says. “Despite race, national-
ity, gender, and sexuality, every-
one has had somebody who’s 
bullied them…Overcoming that 
oppression, that’s what attracts 
me to the course.”


As students learn, the teach-
ers in front of them consider their 
own roles. 
“I’m trying to think of myself 
as less [of] a teacher and more as 
a facilitator of discussion,” said 
Scudder, whose sentiments were 
shared by the other white teach-
ers I spoke with who are teaching 
the course.


Williams, who is one of two 
women of color in her seven-per-
son department, believed that that 
attitude might distill classroom 
discussion. “The white teach-
ers who are teaching this course 
probably are worried about saying 
the wrong thing or don’t know 
how to have these conversations 
about race,” she said. “They don’t 
want to upset their students or 
perpetuate something.” 
Wesley noted how that representation was 
important to him and his classmates: “[Williams] is 
someone who has felt disparities…since she looks 
like us, we feel like what we’re being taught is more 
personal in that way.”


But regardless of background or identity, 
Williams acknowledged that everyone has some-
thing to learn from the course. “I’m the first to 
tell my students that just because I am Black does 
not mean I know everything about Black history 
because we are not monolithic,” she said. “There 
are things that I’m learning and unlearning and 
considering other perspectives as we go through 
this together.”


Williams recalled an unexpected learning 
experience for her in her classroom. One day, she 
presented a recent court case to her class regard-
ing a Black student who was suspended by his 
Texas high school for refusing to cut his hair. She 
intended for the case study to demonstrate the 
future of Black excellence and beauty, incorpo-
rating the idea from previous units of race as a 
construct. In response, one of Williams’ students 
asked whether or not he would cut his hair when 
he entered the workforce. Williams was surprised 
how susceptible her students were to messaging 
around “what is proper, what is presentable, who 
gets to decide.” 
For Williams and her students, her devi-
ation from the original lesson plan became an 
opportunity to illustrate how the course’s signif-
icance transcended arbitrary facts and grades. In 
Williams’s classroom, the course served to bridge 
the sometimes wide divide between the student 
and the individual.


Though teachers had various interpretations 
of the course, they shared recognition of its value.


Borowski described this class as an oppor-
tunity to promote interest in educational careers, 
saying, “We want to push more of our students 
to become teachers.” Borowski highlighted the 
importance of representative curricula and teach-
ing, considering he is positioned as a white edu-
cator in a predominantly non-white community. 
“This course can be a unifier if done correctly.”


While Williams had apprehensions about 
having a “real” history course being situated out-
side of the popular U.S. History curriculum, she 
approved of what was available. “If they’re not 
going to completely rewrite and review the U.S. 
History curriculum,” she said, “then yes, this 
course does do well to stand alone.”


To Williams, though the course itself leaves 
room for improvement, it represents something 
invaluable. “I think this course in particular hope-
fully allows students to connect to not just content 
in a more authentic way but really see we’ve all 
contributed something to make this nation what 
it is. There’s good and bad and ugly everywhere, 
but there’s so much value in being able to explore 
these things together.”


“The mere existence of this sends a message,” 
Williams said, “that it is important, that it matters, 
that it is U.S. History.” Connecticut’s students 
and teachers are the proof.  ∎
