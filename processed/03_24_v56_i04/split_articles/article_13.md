EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Diana Gilman-Ford and her 
daughter live 50 yards down 
the street from Tweed New 
Haven Airport. 

The ground below is far away.  
Gallicchio may be getting ready to leave. 
The neighborhood she loved, where she raised 
her three kids and has lived for twenty-five 
years, has now changed to the point of unrec-
ognition. “I am one of the people with the 
wherewithal to leave,” she said. “The people 
who are going to have to stay here and watch 
their homes and their neighborhood and their 
physical health deteriorate, it’s depressing.”

Gilman-Ford doesn’t have plans to leave 
yet, although she has taken a step back from 
the airport fight. “It’s just consumed me,” she 
said. “It’s consumed my kids. I took the flight 
tracker off my phone,” she said. “I must have 
filed three hundred complaints, I never got one 
response, not one.” She used to take her kids 
walking along the Tweed border on Thompson 
Avenue; she'd point out groundhogs and ducks 
to them along the path. The trees were cleared 
in 2020 as part of a drainage plan, and the ani-
mals never came back. Now that they are gone, 
Gilman-Ford is letting her own garden grow at 
her house one block away. The garden is over-
grown but she doesn’t want to cut down the 
rhododendron bush—rabbits recently moved 
in. “I’m going to be the idiot that leaves all the 
crappy brush on my front yard,” she said. “I 
don’t want to kill the animals.” Above her, in 
the sky, the air boomed as another Avelo 737 
came in for landing.  ∎

**Tweed New Haven Airport Expansion**

will be no significant impact from the expan-
sion on the land, waters, and people surround-
ing Tweed.

On September 26, 2023, another fed-
eral department got involved in the dis-
pute. Admiral Rachel Levine, the Assistant 
Secretary for Health in the U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services issued a letter 
to four FAA officials urging them to conduct 
an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) 
for Tweed’s expansion. In addition to restart-
ing and expanding study into environmental 
and health impacts, the EIS would also neces-
sitate considerably more community input 
and feedback. In the letter, she references 
the environmental and health hazards many 
neighborhoods around Tweed already face, 
notably their high asthma rates. The letter 
was issued in September. Three months later, 
the FAA issued the Environmental Assessment 
and Finding of No Significant Impact, with 
no plans to move forward with an EIS. 
Adam 
Sarvana, 
the 
Communications 
Director for Levine, declined to comment 
on this story. “At this point we’re going to let 
the letter speak for itself,” he said. All Levine 
could do was “strongly recommend the FAA 
conduct further analysis,” as she wrote in her 
letter. The power ultimately landed within the 
internal operations of the FAA. 

East Haven and local nonprofit Save the 
Sound are making one final effort to halt the 
expansion by appealing the decision to the 
federal level. If they win, the decision could 
force an EIS and a much deeper look into the 
potential impacts than the current EA does. 
Still, the changes that have already happened—
the onset of Avelo, the ten flights landing at 
Tweed every day, and the increase in traffic and 
pollution around the airport—do not require 
any additional permission or approval. They 
are here to stay. 

From Rafter’s perspective, these impacts 
are not the only ones to consider. He sees 
Tweed as having an obligation not only to East 
Haven, but also to communities much farther 
away—all along the southern U.S. coast where 
Avelo flies to. That network of the aviation 
economy, connected by runways, planes, and 
corporations that easily cross state lines, relies 
in part on Tweed. On a heavy traffic day, it may 
take twenty or twenty-five minutes to reach 
downtown New Haven from Tweed Airport. 
In that same amount of time, 150 people could 
be halfway to Baltimore, one of the eighteen 
Avelo destinations. These transportation routes, 
as they become more habituated, create a con-
nection between two places, economies, and 
communities that is no longer dependent upon 
physical proximity. In Rafter’s air traffic con-
troller office, it’s easy to feel close to the wide 
sky and the planes crisscrossing it high above.
