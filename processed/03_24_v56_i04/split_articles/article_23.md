EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
On a cold February afternoon, 
ten people scatter among identi-
cal rows of chairs in the basement 
of the New Haven Free Public Library 
(NHFPL). Between the patterned surfaces, 
diffusely lit by the overhead fluorescents, 
the room hums with noise. It is an hour 
and a half before the opening day of the 
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) 
site, which operates as a branch of the 
Internal Revenue Service’s national VITA 
program. Here, at Connecticut’s largest 
VITA site, Yale students run the operation. 

Thirty minutes before the site offi-
cially opens, Yale student volunteers 
wander in. With widened eyes, they scan 
the waiting area for their fellow students, 


now full of clients. Last year, the site 
brought more than $2 million back to 
New Haven and helped more than a 
thousand people file for free. 

While helping taxpayers avoid costly 
tax preparation fees, VITA sites also aim 
to increase access to tax credits like the 
Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and 
Child Tax Credit (CTC). These credits are 
part of the complicated web of programs 
that define the United States’ social wel-
fare system. However, claiming them is 
difficult for those without a professional 
accountant or online tax preparation 
services. Out of the one hundred and 
forty eight million individual tax returns 
filed in 2020, only a little more than four 
million were filed for free. Without the 
time or energy to parse through the 
code by hand, the most economically 
disadvantaged people—including those 
who do not speak English—bear this 
bureaucratic and administrative bur-
den the most. As a result, these social 
benefits often do not reach those who 
need it. Many New Haveners stand to 
benefit tremendously from the money 
these credits put back in their pockets. 
According to Census data, 21 percent of 
New Haven residents live under the fed-
eral poverty line. 

Every year, around 20 to 25 percent 
of Connecticut residents eligible for the 
EITC do not claim it, according to IRS 
estimates. Additionally, an estimated 
two-thirds of those who miss out on 
significant EITC returns nationwide are 
those who choose not to file because 
they are below the income threshold that 
requires them to submit a tax return. In 
Connecticut, the average EITC return 
was $2,294 for the 2022 tax year, a signif-
icant boost for taxpayers. Reporting by 
Annie Lowrey in The Atlantic argues that 
these tax credits mirror a larger trend in 
social welfare: benefits are shrouded in 
a sprawling, dysfunctional, and complex 
web of programs that obscures access for 
those who need them the most. People 
who do attempt to claim these bene-
fits face time-consuming bureaucracies, 
invasions of privacy, and the stigma that 
surrounds social welfare.   

VITA serves as a strange band-aid 
to these gaps, tasking volunteers with 
the intimate business of interacting 
with clients one-on-one and handling 
their Social Security cards, government 
IDs, and financial documents. On Yale’s 
site, the impersonal bureaucratic system 
becomes personal, at once highlighting 
the people behind the tax code and the 
barriers to access of the current system. 

When I spoke to John DeStefano 
Jr., Mayor of New Haven from 1994 
to 2014, he framed the VITA program as 
a matter of civic duty, for both the vol-
unteer and the taxpayer. Volunteers give 
back to their neighbors “in a very tradi-
tional social contract sort of way,” while 
taxpayers contribute through their tax 
dollars. DeStefano emphasized that 
this definition of citizenship includes 
undocumented people, who can pay 
taxes through the acquisition of a Tax 
ID number and utilize VITA sites to help 
them file.

When I asked DeStefano about the 
barriers people face to filing taxes, he 
remarked, “I think that some things are 
complicated,” acknowledging that lan-
guage differences can exacerbate these 
challenges. However, he equated fil-
ing taxes to getting your driver’s license 
or passing a driver’s test. “I really don’t 
think that’s too big of a burden to expect 
of people,” DeStefano said. 

VITA leadership repeatedly told me 
that a significant challenge they face in 
providing effective service is language 
barriers. According to Census data, 20 
percent of people speak Spanish in New 
Haven, including those who may be 
bilingual. Co-President Wendy Zhang 
’25 acknowledged difficulties in recruit-
ing enough Spanish-speaking preparers, 
challenging VITA’s ability to provide 
the accessible services they aspire to. 

The Yale student volunteers and clients 
were separated by another dynamic: 
race. Census data estimates that 30 per-
cent of New Haven residents identify as 
Black or African American, compared 
to 7 percent of non-international stu-
dents at Yale. 

Historically, government social safety 
net programs have excluded Black 
Americans, through both explicit and 
implicit means. This form of structural 
racism has hindered Black people from 
building generational wealth. Despite 
this historical context, Black Americans 
are pigeonholed into harmful stereo-
types like the “Welfare Queen,” popu-
larized by President Ronald Reagan in 
the nineteen-seventies, that depict them 
as the primary beneficiaries of social 
welfare, leeching off of hard-working 
taxpayers. These racist characterizations 
rest on the American ideal of “pulling 
yourself up by your bootstraps,” sham-
ing those who access social benefits like 
tax credits.

Outside of the U.S., an esti-
mated 
thirty-six 
countries—includ-
ing Singapore, the U.K., Germany, and 
Japan—utilize an alternative return-free 
filing system. The government pre-fills 
information about an individual’s income 
into an online portal, prompting the user 
to confirm or amend the information. 
On the taxpayer’s end, this takes minutes, 
compared to the nine hours the average 
American taxpayer spends filing their 
taxes every year—according to IRS esti-
mates. Since the U.S. government already 
receives information about an individual’s 
income through their employers, it could 
follow those countries’ leads in instituting 
an easy filing system, which would reach 
an estimated 41 percent of the population. 
This would also eliminate the need for 
many to visit VITA sites or pay for private 
tax preparation services. 

Since Reagan, president after pres-
ident has repeatedly pushed for similar 
reforms. But the tax preparation indus-
try, which stands to profit tremendously 
from a complicated and inaccessible tax 
system, has intensely lobbied against 
such reforms. In 2003, a coalition of tax 
prep companies, including the leading 
company Intuit, entered an agreement 
with the IRS in which the government 
agency agreed to stop providing its 
own online free file system. In exchange, 
tax preparation companies themselves 
operated IRS Free File services in part-
nership with the IRS. These programs 
make online tax preparation available 
to income-qualified taxpayers, about 60 
percent of the population at the time. 

But in practice, these private compa-
nies deliberately obscured access to Free 
File portals and deceivingly labeled paid 
services as “free.” In 2021, Intuit pulled 
out of IRS Free File and in 2022, only 2 
percent of people eligible for Free File 
took advantage of the program. This year, 
the IRS is piloting its own online tax 
preparation software through the Direct 
File program in twelve states, excluding 
Connecticut. 

Currently, Yale’s VITA program is 
not pushing political advocacy for tax 
reforms. When I brought up the idea 
to VITA Co-President Joanna Wypasek 
’24, she speculated that they might be 
able to implement advocacy in the 
next fall semester. 

“[B]eing from Yale is not a badge 
of honor in that situation,” Rena Liu 
’26, a second-year advanced preparer 
said, acknowledging the trust required 
between tax filer and student. Joining 
out of an interest in contributing to New 
Haven, Liu shared that her extracur-
riculars at Yale felt mostly self-serving 
before the spring semester of her first 
year when she joined VITA. 

Many in the city, includ-
ing organizations like New 
Haven Rising, argue that 
Yale does not pay its fair 
share in New Haven due to 
its exemption from prop-
erty taxes because of its 
non-profit status. Although 
Yale has pledged to volun-
tarily contribute $135 mil-
lion over the next six years 
and contributes through 
other initiatives like New 
Haven Promise, the city 
still misses out on $100 
million a year. “I feel like 
almost being at VITA was 
kind of like a small way in 
which I could be like, ‘I’m 
really sorry that I am bene-
fitting massively from a sys-
tem that hurt you,’” Liu said. 

I 
sat down with Tom 
Costa, a librarian at the 
NHFPL who has worked with 
Yale students on VITA for 
roughly twenty years. Earlier, 
I had wandered around the 
library, observing the exten-
sive resources housed in the 
building: shared computers, 
a café, a teen center, and a 
“Tinker Lab.” Speaking in a slow, mea-
sured cadence, Costa explained that the 
library’s wide array of offerings are in 
service of the library’s mission “to be an 
actual community center.” Among these 
programs is VITA, hosted in the basement 
next to a popular teen center and a social 
work office.

“The city sees this as a very import-
ant program,” Costa said, emphasiz-
ing the continual support of the New 
Haven Mayor’s office through events 
like an annual kickoff. “[B]ecause these 
funds are coming back in sizable refund 
amounts to the individuals, to the fami-
lies, and they spend it in the community, 
thereby boosting small businesses.” 

Although around fifteen VITA sites 
operate in New Haven, Costa said the 
downtown NHFPL VITA location is the 
largest in the state of Connecticut, 
regularly completing the most returns 
per year. 

The downtown NHFPL site disaffil-
iated from Yale over the pandemic due 
to university restrictions on in-person 
operations. However, all of NHFPL’s VITA 
volunteers are Yale students, both under-
graduate and graduate. The job demands 
a high level of responsibility and pro-
fessionalism from its leadership—other 
VITA sites often run out of established 
non-profits, like United Way. Student 
leaders draw from a deep well of insti-
tutional knowledge, working with an 
extensive list of partnering organizations 
to make the site function: the NHFPL, 
Connecticut Association for Human 
Service, Yale Hunger & Homelessness 
Action Project, and the IRS. 

Costa outlined the evolution of 
the program from its inception in New 
Haven in the early two-thousands to the 
present. The site grew steadily in pub-
licity and capacity throughout cycles of 
Yale student leaders. The COVID-19 pan-
demic challenged the program, but it has 
since rebounded, with ninety-eight cur-
rently active volunteers. The volunteers 
I spoke to were motivated to give back
