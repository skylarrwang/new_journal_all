expansion. A veteran of the aviation indus-
try, he’s been in similar situations before. “I’ve 
lived at the end of runways, I’ve lived near 
airports,” Rafter said. “I understand their 
concerns.” He says opponents, though vocal, 
are not the only ones with an opinion about 
Tweed. The people who use the airport, who fly 
the Avelo flights, park in the nearby parking 
lot, and work jobs in the terminal, he argues, 
are showing their support for the airport and 
its expansion through their actions. Tweed also 
has its vocal cheerleaders: numerous residents 
of New Haven, East Haven, and surrounding 
towns who post updates on new Avelo routes, 
videos taking off over the Long Island Sound, 
and updates on weather delays. 


Yale students and affiliates alike also fre-
quently fly through Tweed. Camila Young 
’26 has taken over twelve Avelo flights since 
beginning college between New Haven and 
her home in Miami. “I really like Tweed,” she 
said. For Young, the small airport is convenient 
and she finds the people there friendly. “It 
seems kind of like the mom-and-pop version 
of the airport.” 


Most days, Rafter has the tower to himself. 
From up here, he can see the entire expanse 
of Tweed: the houses on Burr Street which sit 
right across from the airport gates; the cars 
loading and unloading in front of the terminal; 
the brook that runs from the parking lot to the 
tower; and the planes as they land, taxi, disem-
bark passengers, and take off again. Above it all 
is the expansive sky, visible for 360 degrees from 
the wrap-around windows in Rafter’s tower.
From up here, Tweed looks beautiful. 
The tarmac is lower than the surrounding 
houses, with orange and red foliage on all 
sides. To the East Haven side of the airport, 
where the new terminal will be built, Rafter 
points out a few commercial buildings and 
the woods he says separates the airport from 
residential areas. “The longest highway in 
the world is a runway,” he says. “There are 
airports around the entire country and they 
are part of a larger system.”


The Environmental Concerns
G
ilman-Ford stands in the parking lot of 
Robinson Aviation on the east side of the ter-
minal, watching the planes. Next to her, the sur-
face of her car, a 2010 Mercury Sable, is covered 
in a thin layer of brown grime which she says is 
from airplane combustion. A yellow “Stop Tweed 
Expansion” sticker is peeling off at the edges. A 
plane took off three minutes ago, and it takes that 
long for the jet fumes to make their way over on 
the wind. 


Both Gilman-Ford and her daughter have 
asthma. She said her daughter’s asthma attacks 
have become more frequent since Avelo arrived. 
In East Haven, more than 21 percent of chil-
dren have asthma compared to just 14 percent 
in New Haven and just 13 percent throughout 
the rest of Connecticut. East Haven is already 
home to several oil storage facilities, power 
plants, and trash collections, not to mention a 
mile-long stretch of I-95. East Haven is also an 
Environmental Justice Community, defined by 
the Connecticut state government as an area 
with high poverty rates where developers must 
have a plan to engage local stakeholders before 
they can seek permits. This is usually done 
through public meetings or comment periods, 
where residents can provide feedback on pro-
posed plans. Because Tweed has been zoned 
as an airport since its inception, and because 
airports fall largely under federal jurisdiction, 
the expansion hasn’t legally required all these 
state-level procedures.

neath the air traffic control 
tower, underneath the termi-
nal, and down the tarmac on 
the other side.

As a result, some residents have taken 
it upon themselves to assess the environ-
mental and health impacts of Tweed on 
the already-impacted communities. A local 
environmental group called 10,000 Hawks 
partnered with Tufts University researcher 
Neelakshi Hudda to study air pollution around 
Tweed. Residents kept air quality monitors 
in their homes over the course of two weeks. 
Hudda found that ultrafine air pollution parti-
cles increase by 188 percent during plane take-
off and landing, up to half a mile away from 
the airport.


In December 2023, the Federal Aviation 
Authority (FAA) issued a Finding of No 
Significant Impact (FONSI), which concluded 
that Tweed’s expansion would have no signif-
icant impact on the environment. This find-
ing was the result of the FAA Environmental 
Assessment (EA), a routine procedure that 
must be completed for expansion plans to 
move forward. 


“When I heard the news of the FONSI I 
burst into tears and I doubled over on the 
floor,” Gallicchio said. “I was literally that 
shocked. The EA was a complete shocking act of 
greenwashing.” 


Save the Sound, a New Haven-based non-
profit, is currently appealing the Environmental 
Assessment. It cites the numerous state and fed-
eral agencies—including the Environmental 
Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services, and the Connecticut 
Department of Energy and Environmental 
Protection—that, like Gallicchio, have pointed 
out shortcomings in the document. For example, 
ultrafine particle pollution was not considered in 
the FAA’s EA, as these are not federally-regulated 
pollutants. Neither were the impacts of leaded fuel 
used by small, private aircrafts. Wetland impacts 
are also largely left out of the document, which 
states that there are “no critical habitats within the 
project site,” a fact that local residents and Save 
the Sound refute.


According to the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric 
Administration, 
the 
aviation 
industry accounts for 3.5 percent of warming 
worldwide. If the industry were a country, it 
would be the sixth-largest emitter in the world 
as of 2019. Opponents of Tweed see this as a key 
reason to limit the growth of the airport. “This 
is an expansion of an impossibly wet, small, 
foggy airport during an era of climate crisis 
when every responsible policy maker I know 
talks about ways we need to reduce our carbon 
usage and our carbon footprint,” Gallicchio said. 
She said that when she brought up these con-
cerns to Elicker in a July 2022 meeting with him 
and Economic Development Administrator 
Michael Piscitelli, she was quickly dismissed. 
“[Piscitelli] said that global warming is 
a global problem and this is a local issue,” 
Gallicchio said. Piscitelli did not recall this 
conversation and referenced the potential 
local environmental benefits from moving the 
terminal—including higher stormwater stor-
age capacity at the airport. Elicker also con-
tested that this is his administration’s position. 
“[Planes] have jet fuel that is detrimental for 
the climate,” Elicker said. “But that doesn’t 
mean we should never fly anywhere. We can’t 
look at the airport in isolation and there is so 
much we are doing as a city to reduce our cli-
mate impacts.”


The current expansion put forth by 
Avports includes plans for a six-story parking 
garage, a 638-foot runway expansion, a 462,500 
square-foot airplane parking building, and 
the new terminal that will come in at around 
80,000 square feet. Residents and environ-
mental activists alike fear the potential harm 
this construction will have on surrounding 
wetlands, and also the prevalence of flooding. 
Low-lying and coastal East Haven is already a 
flood-prone city, with almost a third of homes 
at severe risk of flooding within the next thirty 
years. The new terminal will be built on stilts 
to protect against future water damage. This is 
still a rare design for airport terminals, but one 
that might become more popular as flood risks 
from climate change increase. 


The Political Quagmire
T
hroughout the three-year expansion 
fight, opponents have complained that 
everyone seems to be paying attention to other 
things, anything but Tweed, including those 
who are tasked to legislate on it. At an April 
2023 meeting of the South Central Regional 
Council of Governments, East Haven Mayor 
Joseph Carfora accused his colleagues of neg-
ligence as they voted to pass a resolution in 
support of the Tweed expansion and the draft 
Environmental Assessment.


“First of all, I want to ask everyone on 
this board,” Carfora said to the assembled 
council. “Has anybody read this EA?” It was 
a hybrid meeting—Elicker called via Zoom 
from his New Haven office. Carfora held up 
a copy of the 216-page draft environmental 
assessment document, spiral bound with a 
plastic cover. “Has anybody took the time 
out to read this?”


Hoey and Elicker responded that they 
had read most of it, but only two other people 
in the adjoined crowd raised their hand, both 
onlookers, not members of the council. “I want 
to ask all of you,” Carfora then said. “How can 
you vote if you don’t know what’s in this?” The 
rest of the members looked on, a few holding 
on to their hands, as Carfora continued to speak, 
growing irate. Carfora cursed, and only then did

Elicker chime in.“Point of order,” he said. “If we 
could all use appropriate language.” 


Carfora’s motion to table the resolution 
failed with a 5-4 vote. He stood up and, along 
with two staff members, left the meeting. The 
council then voted on the original resolution in 
support of the Tweed expansion and draft envi-
ronmental assessment. It passed unanimously, 
though two members abstained: North Haven 
First Selectman Michael Freda and Woodbridge 
Deputy First Selectwoman Sheila McCreven. 


Although half the airport sits within East 
Haven’s borders, ownership belongs solely to 
New Haven. Legal jurisdiction and regulation 
largely fall on the federal government, as is the 
case with airports around the country. “This is 
lopsided,” Carfora said before he left the April 
2023 meeting. “Every time I look back at this I’m 
getting more information. Everything is twisting 
and turning and it’s all against East Haven.” One 
aspect that East Haven does have a small amount 
of control over is the Tweed Airport Authority 
Board of Directors, a group of fifteen unpaid vol-
unteers appointed to govern the airport. 


Of the Board’s fifteen members, eight are 
appointed by The New Haven Mayor’s Office 
with confirmation from the Board of Alders, 
five are appointed by Carfora of East Haven, 
and two are appointed by the South Central 
Regional Council of Governments (SCRCOG). 
The Board governs Tweed and appoints 
the Executive Director, although since the 
forty-three-year Avports lease was approved, 
its day-to-day responsibilities have shrunk. 
The Authority and the Board do accept noise 
complaints from residents, who also can send 
them directly to the Connecticut Department 
of Energy and Environmental Protection 
through a complaint line. Board meetings are 
also open to the public, and the board reserves 
time for comments and questions from indi-
viduals, but they rarely respond directly to pub-
lic comments. More often than not, individuals 
are referred to the FAQ page on the website.


Don’t Hate the Player
W
hen Carfora walked out of the SCRCOG 
meeting on April 26, 2023, he couldn’t stop 
the council from passing a resolution in support 
of the Tweed expansion and draft environmen-
tal assessment. Ironically, Avports, which leases 
Tweed from the Airport Authority, which leases 
land from the City of New Haven, did not need 
the SCRCOG’s vote of support to proceed with its 
expansion plans. 


As a certified airspace, Tweed is under the 
specific jurisdiction of the federal govern-
ment, specifically the FAA, which regulates the 
American aviation industry. The administra-
tion’s primary duty is to guarantee the safety 
of planes and passengers in the air. To ensure 
this, it manages air traffic control, regulates 
planes and airlines, and issues licenses to pilots. 
The organization’s main goal, as stated on its 
website, is “providing the safest, most efficient 
aerospace industry in the world.”


To this end, the FAA has conducted its 
job admirably in New Haven. Air traffic has 
expanded, becoming more accessible and effi-
cient, and there have been no major safety 
incidents since Avelo arrived at Tweed. But 
although the agency has Environmental 
Programs that ensure airports are up to the 
standard, environmental protection and regu-
lation is not the FAA’s top priority, nor is it a 
part of their stated mission. Yet, the FAA is still 
the only body—municipal, state, or federal—
with the ability to definitively find that there
