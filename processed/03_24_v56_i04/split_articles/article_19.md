Name it to a God
19-year-old girls in fifteenth-century 
Spain, across the ocean, staring back—
every afternoon, I felt connected to them.
Two years later, at 21, I spent a month 
in France with twelve other students who 
wanted to write. We were living in a town 
called Auvillar. Pilgrims walking the 
Camino de Santiago pass through this 
town on their way to northwestern Spain. 
When they reach the coast and look out 
toward the Atlantic, they face, almost 
directly, where I stood on Cape Cod.
Église Saint-Pierre hosts a church 
service each night for anyone passing 
through Auvillar. I joined on a Wednesday, 
taking a moment away from trying to nail 
to the page places and people and purring 
air. The priest blesses the pilgrims, giving 
them strength for their next day of walk-
ing. How many have come before them, 
dirty feet on this same weathered ground? 
How many have walked, and walked, and 
walked, have given their body over to 
aching hips and raw skin to serve some-
thing greater? How many have doubted 
themselves and their God in the heat of 
midday? And then: how many have sat 
in these pews, where I sat one Wednesday 
in July, and had a priest tell them to keep 
walking, to keep going, that they are doing 
the right thing? That bodily relief—reas-
surance flooding out pain—that, I think, 
could feel like God.

When I stand in a church, I do not 
feel God. I do not feel a Father, or a 
Son, or a Holy Spirit. I feel the people 
who have stood there before me and 
looked for something beyond them-
selves. Who took meaning and comfort 
from these walls, and from the words 
and the music—and maybe from the 
God—that echoed in the vaulted mar-
ble ceilings. I am not interested in the 
Bible—until I think about the peo-
ple who have turned to it for answers. 
These people: their existence moves 
me. It moves me to stand in this place 
where they stood, to read these words 
that they read, to let go of my body as 
they let go of theirs.

I have always been too sensitive, Ada 
Limon writes in a different poem. A 
weeper from a long line of weepers.

I
n Charlotte Brontë’s Villette, Lucy 
Snowe—fiercely Protestant—falls into 
a depression and stops eating. She con-
fesses to a Catholic priest and then has a 
religious breakdown on the steps outside 
the church. Every time I read the scene, I 
wonder if she collapsed from low blood 
sugar. Feel it in the body, name it to a god.

did think that I felt God one time 
in my childhood church. Our choir 
director, Sue, and her son had not spo-
ken in many years. The son was com-
ing for Christmas to mend things and 
to watch our yearly pageant. But there 
was a snowstorm, and his travel was dis-
rupted, and he was stuck in New York. 
No public transportation could get him 
to town before Mary gave birth.

So a deacon named Don drove through 
the snow, three hours each way, to pick him 
up. In the middle of the pageant, when a 
little lamb was singing, the door exploded 
open. The music stopped. Every head in 
the room turned to the door, and then to 
Sue. She looked at her son, smiled, and kept 
conducting. And we all kept singing—faces 
a little brighter, eyes a little damper.

And maybe it was God. But now, all 
that I can remember is Don’s virtue, and 
Sue’s music, and the relief of a lot of people 
who wanted good things for each other. ∎
