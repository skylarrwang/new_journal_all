n the spirit of an issue devoted to the 
idea of "reproduction" in all its forms, 
the Editors considered it appropriate to 
reprint our founding editors' original mission 
statement, printed in 1968. Because it con-
fronts the meaning of the new in light of the 
old, the statement seems as relevant to us today 
as it was 38 years ago: 
(This .universiry has once again ·reached that 
-
' 
stage in history when people are talking about tlie 
New Yale) presumablY to be distinguished rom t~rt 
Old Yale) which in its own dqy was presumabjy con-
sidered new. · 
Wishing to share in this modernity) we have 
chosen The New ournal as the name or our publi-
cation. Besides) things seemed slow around here. '' 
This year's theme issue shares the con-
cerns of that magazine 
what is old, what is 
new, and in this digital age of reproduction, 
what does· it mean to be new? In this issue, 
. we explore the replication of ideas, in1ages, 
and people. The New Journal has traditionally 
printed a theme issue at this titne of year, so 
in a sense we are embracing a double-form of 
reproduction. In adhering to tradition, we 
make the old new again.
