**Comfort Food, Comfort Cultures**

Comfort food, the bites of Americana typically associated with home, wield tremendous nostalgic power; the desire to return to the figurative womb of one's childhood kitchen is so potent, there are programs on the Food Network extolling the virtue of grits and chic New York eateries soliciting twenty-dollar meatloaf. 

But here in New Haven, a small but diverse community, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, apple pie, and burgers fail to represent the diversity of the population. While a native New Englander salivates at the memory of Mom's clam chowder, a Korean immigrant reminisces about the kimchi (a spicy cabbage dish) that his omma fermented from scratch. Over the last two decades, the flowering of a densely packed multicultural restaurant community in the Elm City has come to reflect this plurality. 

For a chef or restaurateur hailing from a distant locale, reproducing familiar food in a foreign environment is not unlike the process of assimilation itself: Ethnicities intermingle, the new world meets the old, and a certain je ne sais quoi is inevitably lost and gained in translation. 

To create this sort of comfort food, cooks must replicate their native cuisine from a vast spatial~ and often temporal, distance a far cry from a bowl of Easy Mac. 

Unique, indigenous ingredients can be difficult to import, and satisfying the tastes of a foreign audience is a complex art. Moreover, in the contemporary gastronomic climate where fusion has made easy bedfellows of ingredients like goat cheese and wasabi, the literalization of the "melting pot" poses a new challenge to maintaining one's culinary identity. 

These days, can a French restaurant really be French· if it employs influences from Southeast Asia? 

In the face of these questions, a group of New Haven restaurants has taken different approaches towards the process of recreation. A renowned Spanish chef, trained by the greatest cooks in the world, focuses on self-expression and creativity. An Eritrean refugee and businessman seeks to spread the gospel of sharing. Two Taiwanese brothers hope to expose their · new homeland to authentic Chinese cooking. Ultimately, all three aspire to redefine the notion of "comfort food" and of American cuisine. 

The Innovator
Luis Bollo, the gastronomic mastermind behind Ibiza, one of the most esteemed Spanish restaurants in the world (it was hailed by The New York Times as the best of its kind in the US), refuses to serve paella. The traditional rice dish, perhaps the most widely known item on the Spanish menu, is notably absent on Ibiza's carte du jour and its omission is no accident. "It's true," he says, folding his arms as if preparing to defend his culinary ideology. His thick Spanish accent softens the "z" in the restaurant's name to a "thh" sound. "We're doing something different here our food represents a new Spain." 

Ballo's desire to reconceptualize the native Spanish diet is the product of a transnational existence. Born in San Sebastian, in Spain's northern Basque territory, he attended culinary school there as a teenager before moving to Mexico City. In 1992, Bolio immigrated to America, then returned to Europe to fine-tune his art. Later, in a partnership with Ignacio Blanco, he converted Pike Tapas, a modest restaurant nestled between a barbershop and a fraternity on High Street, into Ibiza. 

The staples of a Spanish diet.-ham; cheese, fine wines, olive oil can all be found in the restaurant's kitchen. Bolio, readily analyzing his country's gastronomy, points to the significance of its lengthy border on the Mediterranean Sea. "Because of their shared coastline," he notes, "Spanish food is not ·that different from, . say, the provincial food of France. Like Italians, we use tomatoes but in a different way." 

This difference is magnified at Ibiza, where a glance at the restaurant's menu may simultaneously elicit awed delight from the epicurean and trepidation from the inexperienced diner. Ballo ·and · his staff infuse regional delicacies, like squid cooked in its own ink and roasted suckling pig (a Castilian dish), with accoutrements and flavors extracted from a wealth of intercontinental sources. The result is Iberian cuisine infused with a whiff of outside influence. 

The greatest of Ibiza's challenges lies not in its adhering to tradition or achieving innovation, but in satisfying cross-Atlantic audiences. According to Bolio, the development of one of the restaurant's most renowned offerings exemplifies this problem. "I knew that I wanted to serve baccalao, which is a white fish that is dehydrated with salt to produce a unique flavor and dry texture. I believed that Americans could enjoy the flavor, but not the texture, so I experimented with the dish in Spam, salting my own fish overnight. I wanted to create something that works for everyone, to compromise." 

Despite such concessions, Bolio maintains that he always intends for his food to express his own experience and background. "My wife says that her country can be found in her language and the food of her people. My personal history is with Spain, and I do not want to lose touch with those roots." 

"I borrow aspects from every part of Spain," states Bolio. "Towns in Andalusia, Galicia ... but I also look to other countries for inspiration. I've taken walks on the streets of my home country with a French chef .. ·. I've expanded my knowledge of food through my travels. For example, ceviche is on our menu, and I learned what it was when I was in Mexico City. 

Bolla's expression of his Spanish heritage is innovative, both in his willingness to incorporate multicultural influences and in the execution of his dishes. For example, a steamed octopus appetizer is accompanied by a "potato foamy emulsion." The textural conversion of starch into foam an impressive effect achieved rather ingloriously by filling a whipped cream cartridge with a liquefied material is a method that Bolio attributes to Fernan Adria, a world-renowned Barcelonan chef famous for his new wave practices. 

Bolio insists, however, on avoiding novelty for novelty's sake. "I like to play with new techniques," he affirms, "but only if they enhance the dish." 

The Entrepeneur
If Luis Bolio is the T.S. Eliot of the New Haven dining scene,. then Gideon Ghebreyesus, the co-owner of Caffe Adulis, is its Shel Silverstein. 

Ghebreyesus is a warm, broad-shouldered man with a genial grin and an eloquent manner. At age 18, he fled his native Eritrea when the East African nation fought a brutal war of separation with Ethiopia. His affability belies an astute business sense sharpened by years in the restaurant world. 

"After immigrating to the States," he recalls, "I studied at Southern Connecticut State, then quickly began working in restaurants." These restaurants all of which served Western cuisine included 368 Steak House on Audubon, Gentree's on York Street, Bruxelles, and Scoozi on Chapel. The demise of three out of four of these establishments (only Scooz1 still exists) reflects the precariousness of the industry; it also sheds light on the rarity of a success like Adulis, which continues to thrive over a decade into its existence. 

"As I was moving up from kitchen manager to floor manager and so on, it became clear that New Haven needed something different. My brother [Ficre Ghebreyesus, Adulis's head chef] and I came up with the idea of opening up an Eritrean restaurant, which, of course, was a natural thing to do. I think it filled a gap, because the food is interesting and not something that many can reproduce in their
