intrigued by my answer; he is indig-
nant: "You think this is the tattoo 
world?! It used to be guys on 
Barleys. This is the way the industry 
is going · it's Star bucks, it's main-
stream." 

As the industry has grown, there 
• 
have been more and more tattoo 
conventions across America, at 
which renowned artists give custom 
tattoo~ ~p.d compete for prizes that 
recognize their work. Ralph regular-
ly werit to conventions until, at one

sionment' grew 
when 
Harley-
Davidson, Warner Brothers, and 
Walt Disney sued tattoo parlors for 
using copyrighted logos: "Come on, 
people have been getting tats of 
Mickey Mouse since he was invent-
ed. And now yuppie ass wants 
Mickey Mouse." 

et Steve still feels at_ home, · 
despite being opposite of 
the stereotypically surly 
"old-school tattoo artist" to which 
Tyrone referred. He grew up in a 
middle-class, three-child family in 
North Branford. The Malers have 
always been involved with arts and 
crafts, and they approve of Steve's 
career path. Steve has loved to draw 
since childhood, and took art as his 
only honors class in high school. 
Between high school and The Edge, 
he went through some rough titnes. 
He explains, "I was just a real bad 
kid for years 
drinking and drugs ... 
I don't think there's a chernical out 
there that I didn't use in extreme 
amounts. I had my fun. But then it 
February 2006 
just becomes horrible. You don't 
realize there is another way." Steve 
helped overcome his addictions by 
going to AA meetings, at which 
Jeffrey joined him. He considered 
becoming a nurse, but is happy to 
have fallen into the right business. 
( 
He says, "The only thing that keeps 
me sober is helping others." Steve 
currently lives with his parents and 
their relationship is better than ever. 
Since July, he has been casually dat-
ing Alyssa, a pretty, petite 18 year-
old bartender whom he met when 
she came in for her first tattoo, a 
moon on her foot. 

Ralph is a kinder version of what 
Tyrone calls "an old-school tattoo 
artist." While skulls litter the Edge 
to honor Halloween, at Ralph's sta-
tion they sit year-round. There they

are joined by a skeleton and demon-
. ic jester, both of which dangle from 
Ralph's lamp. Bio-hazard stickers 
stipple- everything. A book titled 
Dogs: How to Draw Them sits near his 
Tupperware jars. 'Ralph' is a fake 
name, because after ·numerous 
'' 
scrapes with the law he is a bit para-
noid. As we talk he looks away from 
me, loudly clinking needles into jars. 

He is a white, middle-aged, former 
biker with a square torso and a 
tremendous belly. A thick lip-barbell 
and triangular silver studs between 
his eyebrows, combined with his . 
many and macho tattoos 
King 
Neptune, 
tombstones, 
eagles, 
knives, daggers, wizards, a guy in 
quicksand holding up his middle 
finger 
make him look more threat-
ening than the rest of the artists at 
Chapel Street's The Edge Tattoo parlor awaits customers with open doors.

The Edge. But he acts gentler than 
he looks . 

Like many middle-aged tattooed 
men, Ralph got his first tattoos at 
home when he "started messin' 
around real young with India in~." 
He has been giving tats all over 
Connecticut since 1987. Right now 
he is on probation (he won't tell me 
why) and is working at The Edge 
because it is the only parlor in New 
Haven that gives a pay stub, which 
the probation officer requires . 

Unlike Steve and Coniah, Ralph 
never studied art before learning to · 
tattoo. "I didn't get into the busi-
ness to tattoo," he explains, "I got 
into the business for the money." 
And the money is good: A tat-
too artist can . take home up to 
$1500 a week. The 
artist~ split 
their profits with the' tore, bqt 
at $150/tattoo, each of w~ich 
takes around an hour, the net prof-
it accumulates. Despite Ralph's 
intimidating facade, the fact that 
he makes a good living from tattoo-
ing reveals that in addition to 
being a skilled artist, he is agreeable 
with customers. 

t The Edge, I don't see much 
of the 
"yuppie ass" to 
which Ralph referred, but I 
do see a diverse crowd. I meet Keri, 
a sensitive 1 7 year-old waiting for 
her fiancee to finish getting the Bio-
hazard symbols tattooed on his 
wrists. She has a black tribal decal 
on her lower back, as do many tat-
tooed young women. I meet Jim, an 
18 year-old getting the logo fot:. the 
straight-edge lifestyle (a vertical "X 
X X") tattooed on his right calf. He 
explains to me that he doesn't 
smoke, drink, or do drugs, but he's 
not as conservative as straight-edge 
kids who abstain from tattoos . 

Neither Keri nor Jim, nor any other 
teenager I meet, gets grief about 
tats from their parents. Some par-
ents are even inspired to follow

their kids' lead. 

Christina, a statuesque, glowing, 
48 year-old blonde with an MBA, 
quit her job as a CEO of the 
Wadsworth Atheneum to become a 
massage therapist a year ago. She 
received her first, subtle . tattoo (a 
butterfly) at 35, but now says, "I'm · 
braver. I wanted to do what I want-
ed to do. I'm more comfortable let-
ting people know who I am." 

e 
All the artists at The Ec:lge 
except Steve and Ralph believe 
strongly that tats should be mean-
ingful. Steve has no clear ideology 
on the issue 
his philosophy is: 
Get whatever makes you happy. 
Ralph snorts at the idea that tats 
"should" have meaning. But then 
he tells me that each of his tattoos, 
· while not having symbolic value, is 
a happy reminder of the friend 
know about it." And so he walks me 
through the tattooing process as we 
sit at his station. It is sparsely dec-
orated~ On his counter sit two 
framed photos, one of the singer 
Prince (Steve's "higher_ power," 
notes a friend of his), the other a 
still from the film of The Outsiders 
(when I 
say I

Coniah is tattooing the Chinese 
words "healing woman," as well as a 
peacock, which symbolizes "god-
dess" in tantric philosophy on her 
left leg. Coniah designed the image 
just for her. Two real peacock feath-
ers are draped Coniah's station. 
Christina, 
sprawled 
out on 
a 
stretcher like a reclining deity, keeps _ 
looking down her leg with pleasure 
at the evolving tat. She murmurs, 
"Isn't it beautiful?" 

Though abundantly-tattooed 
women occasionally feel disrespect-
ed, most women receive compli-
ments on their tats 
frotn cowork-
ers and friends, if they have visible 
tats, or from lovers and gynecolo-
gists, if they have more hidden ones. 
Men are more likely to have multi-
ple, visible tattoos, and so are more 
likely to feel judged by the non-tat-
tooed. Sebastian, an artist who is 
pretty much covered in black tats, 
reports, "I go to the doctor's and 
they look at me like I'm halfway 
dead already. Old male doctors espe-
cially are like that." 
who gave him that particular tat-
too, even if the friendship faded 
long ago. 

If the artist doesn't like a cus-
tomer's idea for a tat, he or she will 
try to tactfully talk the customer out 
of it. Steve once refused to do a tat-
too of the yellow brick road, 
"because the perspective was all 
wrong and too difficult." 

Tyrone 
forces his customers to think seri-
ously about their whimsical ideas: 
"Don't just get a heart or a rose 
because 'it's feminine.' Do you like 
hearts? 
Do 
you 
like 
roses?" 

Sebastian was once asked to tattoo 
argyle socks onto an old man's feet. 
He told the guy, ''You're an idiot." 

t is a privilege to see how a 
tattoo is made. Many artists 
believe that the art 
must 
pass only from artist to artist, not 
from a book. Coniah explains, 
"Only when [knowledge of a craft] 
becomes popular does an art form 
die." But Steve believes that "if 
somebody's interested, they should 
open revealing anime drawings, car-
toon faces that Steve calls "crazy 
head pictures," and many sketches 
for tatto·o designs. 

Steve places the materials neces-
sary for a tat · on the counter. He 
smears Vitamin A and D ointment 
onto a large popsicle stick so that it 
will hold tiny plastic pots of glyc-
erin ink. He shows me the two 
kinds of needle-tools used for 
every tat job 
one for outlining, 
the other for coloring. Both resem-
ble little guns with long needles 
instead of a bullet-shaft. In the 
ftrst kind, five needles pack closely 
together; in the second, the five are 
spaced more widely apart. The nee-
dles are actually very thin tubes 
that take up ink if touched into a 
pot. Out of the guns' handles twist 
cords that connect to a foot pedal 
on the floor. Ste e taps the pedal, 
demonstrating how the needles 
(currently empty) would spin to 
release ink. Then we move to the 
back room, where he prepares the 
skin-transferable print of a con-
