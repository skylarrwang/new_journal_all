to the exhibit of the royal retreat of the 
Incan _king Sapa Inca Pachacuti. After 
scanning a display of cameras used by 
Bingham, some of the extensive pictures 
he snapped, accurate diaries he scrib-
bled, and maps he drew, I set foot on a 
replica of an ancient Incan road, leading 
to a reproduction of the foyer of the 
Incan king's residence. The walls, floors, 
and trail are crafted from actual molds 
taken of Machu Picchu. If you overlook 
the squeaking "granite" floor, the fiber-
glass "stone" walls, and the panoramic 
photograph of Machu Picchu spanning 
the entire right wall of the second room, 
you can concentrate on the original arti-
facts Bingham carted away from the site 
in 1912. It is around these authentic 
objects that curators Lucy Salazar, a 
n~tive of Peru, and her husband, 
Anthropology Professor Richard Burger, 
have d~signed their exhibit. 

A three-foot-tall ceramic vessel used 
for storing chicha, an Afidean corn beer, is 
the large:;,t:_ , artif~ct in the exhibit, housed 
in a glass -:C:~se {n :1!Je center · of the trail. 
Most of ~e1:'o--~j~ts are more delicate, 
such as metal tools that boast of the 
Incas' metallurgic prowess and smaller 
pottery painted with fine, geometric 
designs. These are displayed in the trape-
zoidal niches used as storage units in the 
stone walls. Although some artifacts are 
on loan from other universities, the tnajor-
ity are from the Peabody collection. These 
objects are the only real artifacts amidst a 
gamut of reproductions, including the 
fake-stone walls, the floor, the panoramic 
photo, three life-sized mannequins of 
men in traditional dress, and a miniature 
of the entire site. 

Salazar sees her work of displaying 
these long-neglected artifacts to recreate 
a small segment of Machu Picchu in 
New Haven 
and several other cities the 
exhibit has visited 
as piecing together 
the highly-organized world of the Incas 
and allowing the public to interact with 
it. After eight years of preparation, she 
can now share the immensity of the 
Incas' 
accomplishments 
at 
Machu 
Picchu and impart lessons of this histo-
ry that are invaluable today. Huge stor-
age houses, for instance, ensured that, in 
times of drought, everyone had food. 
"The people didn't have hunger in the 
empire, because everything was so 
organized," she explains. 

Some of Salazar's favorite parts of t;he 
exhibit are the artifacts that are made in 
matching male and female pairs. Most 
everyday objects were produced in cou-
ples at Machu Picchu, in accordance with 
a belief in reciprocity that ran throughout 
the empire. "It's an Andean concept, but 
the Incas are the fttst to reflect this sym-
bolism," Salazar explains. "The idea is that 
you're not alone," 

This notion of harmony is a far cry 
from the acrimony stirred by the current 
struggle between Yale and the Peruvian 
government over the ownership of the 
artifacts. While the United States' exhibi-
tions of the objects has increased interest 
in the original Machu Picchu, the 
Peruvian government is forcing Yale into 
a cultural battle. For Peru, Machu Picchu 
is a source of national pride: The current 
president, Alejandro Toledo, held his 
inauguration at the historic site in 2001. 
When Salazar left her native Peru in the 
1980s to study in the United States, she 
was not on a quest to unlock the mystery 
of the lost Incan city. As she and her hus-
band became the first academics to study 
the collection as a whole, her interest was 
not derived from or connected with her 
heritage, but rather from the challenge of 
exhibiting culture in general. 

These artifacts have symbolic power 
beyond Salazar's control. Their public 
unveiling in the United States is overshad-
owed by Peru's current revival of indige-
nous pride. And while New Haven's recre-
ation would not be as compelling without 
the original artifacts, it is also possible that 
the artifacts' impact on the public isn't as 
powerful when plucked from the breath-
taking -seu ing and rich history of their 
original home. 


**Printed Matter**

LAST MONTH, IN THE S-WEEPING ENTRANCE 
ha11 to Sterling Memorial Library, sat a 
recently departed and often-overlooked 
exhibit based upon the age-old adage that 
oil and water do not mix (dining halJ soup is 
compelling evidence) Ies a beautiful thing, 
really: pure, unadulterated, and easy science 
for the most ethyl and benzene-phobic 
among us. But this practical knowledge has 
a much larger context in lithography, a print-
ing process that cheerfully exploits nature's 
great divide. From the defiant philosophy 
upon which it is based to the actual printing 
process, which takes place on a large black 
press reca11ing a medieval torture device, 
lithography is a classic process rooted in 
technique. 

Lithography's roots go back to 1798, 
before the era of "photosensitive emul-
sions" and other modern-day technological 
toys. To create a lithograph, artists draw an 
image onto a stone block which they cover 
with acid. The acid reacts with the oil-based 
image in a way that creates "walls" around 
the design. After a quick water wash, the 
artist applies a coating of ink that is retained 
within the walls. A run through a press 
applies only the oily sections to the page 
while the water-based sections remain blank. 
The highly sought-after images are created 
without the hassles or splinters of wood-
cuts, or the burden of finding a middle man 
to do the etching for you. Painless this 
process is not, but, as any burgeoning artist 
could tell you, artistic independence is well 
worth the price. 

The final products, as I saw on a recent 
visit to the exhibit, are well worth the trou-
ble. Though modern, user-friendly, ink-jet 
printing has largely replaced lithography, 
lithographic images are like every person's 
ideal mate: complex, unique, and well-
defined in all of the right areas. 

Sterling's exhibit, entitled "Production, 
Not Reproduction," housed an eclectic 
group of lithographs, running· the gamut 
from ''The Bread Book" 
whose black and 
white pages are filled with close-ups of, well, 
slices of bread 
to a fold-out lithograph of 
a disjointed accordion surrounding magni-
fied blades of grass. 

Burdened with a desperate need to pro-
crastinate? Track Chatles Henri Ford's litho-
graphically produced "Silver Flower Coo" 
(1968). Part art, part visual poetry, it's a book 
of photographs of random words. ''Now 
where's the FIG?" "Like chick inake A 
slick." Or, "Sweetie PIT isn't your label." 

A different showcase housed a powerful 
book about sexual assault 
a red sticker 
bearing the word ''RAPE" attached two 
stark-white flaps across the book's cover, 
patiendy waiting for a reader to come along 
and tear it in hal£ Nearby, another book 
was sprawled ope~ proudly displaying a 
black-and-white photograph of a man's 
hairy, buttocks. The book, "Impressions: 
A Pocket Manual for Aesthetic Wear," is 
a collection of tasteful nudes, with 
swatches of actual fabric covering the 
images. The book manifests its cheeki-
ness with painfully serious commentary 
inscribed alongside the naked rumps. 

But the irreverence of the images 
should come as no surprise, given the 
history and culture of the process. 

Lithography is, in a way, a process of 
contradictions, trying to make one point 
while inadvertently making another. It's 
the technique of "democratic multi-
ples" 
taking the power away from 
snooty gallery-owners and allowing 
artists to see through every detail of their 
work, from its creation to its distribution. 
Yet Norman Paris, Professor of Printing 
at the Yale School of Art says this isn't 
entirely so: In spite of an underlying 
"damn the establishment" mentality, he 
points out, "Lithography is a fine art, so 
it's just as much of a business~ ' 

As Paris argues, "Lith6 g.t:.!lphy is a 
culture that tries to speak about rpass 
culture without being mass cultur~, per. 
se. "But this is what makes lithographs 
paradoxical: The exhibit's Pop Art era 
collection seems to poke fun at mass 
culture, yet its images are produced on 
the same machines as newspapers, busi-
ness materials, and ads, making them a 
distinct part of the very mass consumer 
culture that they satirize. And although 
lithographers harp on "conceptual 
underpinnings" and other lofty ideals, 
the medium's popularity stems largely 
from the fact that lithography is relative-
ly cheap, and easy, too 
at least com-
pared to its predecessors, carved wood 
and stone. 

Now that the Sterling's exhibit is 
over, the lithographs of buttocks and 
accordions are safely tucked away in 
Sterling's stacks. But in spite of the rise 
of ink-jet printing, the process of 
lithography lingers. Just as ~ 
are suck-
ers for scandal, it seems that there is 
something irresistible about the vaguely 
contradictory and irreverent process of 
lithography. 

A chance to "screw the 
establishment," too good to pass up? 
The results of the process, such as a 
flip-book of a housewife morphing into 
Wonder Woman, are just farcical enough 
to catch our eyes. So is lithography a
