Half of Yale's residential colleges-
Berkeley, Branford, Jonathan Edwards,
Pierson/Davenport,
Silliman,
and
Timothy Dwight
have printing press
facilities. Lining their walls are hundreds
of trays of type, each piece made of lead
and a uniform 0.918 inches high.
Despite its deceptively miniature size, a
single piece of type is comprised of
many parts. The most obvious is the _
face
the letter or character cast in relief
at the top. Type is mosdy sorted on a
tray known as the "California Job Case,"
a user-friendly apparatus developed to
move type across the country during the
Gold Rush and separated into various
compartments, the size and order of
which are based on how frequendy each
character appears in the Bible. Upper
cases are on one side, lower cases on
another; numbers are in another area;
commonly used letters have a larger
compartment than lesser-used letters;
letters that are often used next to each
other are placed side by side. The ca's, for
example, are next to the cr's.
Though
this setup is at first difficult to memo-
rize, like the layout of a- keyboard, it
becomes easy to sort and replace type
with practice.
In addition to the walls of type, there

are also-of course
the printing presses
themselves. Though all somewhat differ-
ent, each machine resembles an awkward
loom. The presses consist of impression
cylinders to roll the paper, inking plates,
levers, and several wheels.
Yale's college printing presses are not
far removed from their 15th century
ancestors.
The key difference between
these presses is the reason for their
usage
the printer's motivation.
Five
hundred years ago, printing presses were
the only publishing technique available; in
2006, letterpress stems from a quirky
interest. It takes a certain personality to
spend hours upon hours in a printing
press room, pouring sweat, tears, and
sometimes blood into a creation that
could be seemingly replicated on a com-
puter. Printers are committed to the cre-
ation of a certain aesthetic and enjoy a
satisfaction that working with a mouse
and a screen cannot match. Joseph Luna
'06, a chief printer of Jonathan Edwards
College, says that there is a "printer's
breed" of people possessing "infinite
patience" who are wming to "stt ive for
printer perfection." This "breed" appreci-
ates the subtle difference between a grain-
less, flat laser printout, and a thick, hand-
pressed paper.
The tedium of the process cannot be
overstated. During the Pierson/Davenport
•r
"Journeymen Course" in printing, the ·
instructor and Pierson Fellow, David Rose
'80 printed an announcement leaflet for
the unveiling of a portrait of Pierson
College's Master Goldblatt. The final doc-
ument was simple: an 8 Vz by 11 inch piece
of paper folded in half that read, "Pierson
College, A Por_ttait of the Master."
Pressed for time, Rose was not working
with his usual meticulousness, but it still
took him two hours to assemble the type
of only seven words and then additional
time to print. One can only imagine how
long it must have taken him to produce
one of the crowning achiements of his
printing career at Yale, Benjamin Franklin's
'~dvice on the Choice of a MistreSs."
When he first began, Rose had to teach
himself how to print: so he started collect-
ing printer manuals. Today, he has over
five thousand manuals
more than any-
one in the country.
By day, Rose runs a technology com-
pany.
While his job and his printing
hobby seem to be in opposition, printers
are often well versed in the computer
world, and many feel that their printing
ability informs their digital graphic design
skills. In the 21st century, printing is, after
all, about turning the new into the old.
