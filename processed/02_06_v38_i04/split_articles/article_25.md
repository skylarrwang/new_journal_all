kitchens at home." . 
Even in a well-equipped commercial kitchen, Eritrean food can be difficult to reproduce because it utilizes a unique set of ingredients. In addition to the basics spinach, green beans, squash, lentils Caffe Adulis must import many of its staples directly from Eritrea. 
"There are many ·components, like berbere and cayenne, that simply cannot be acquired here," Gheybreyesus says, dangling a pouch of a blood-red powder wrapped in tin foil. 
«This is berbere ... When you cook with it, you need to let it simmer first." 
The true staple of an Eritrean diet, ''We serve our food communally, on a big platter of injera. ·That is how I ate growing up, and I think that eating and sharing this type of food is a wonderful experience. · Communal eating is a big part of Eritrean culture my brother learned to cook at family gatherings." 
The familial nature of Adulis' environment is present in the Ghebreyesus brothers' willingness to embrace as sources the cuisines of neighboring countries, as well as American influences. 
''We were once a colony of Italy, so there are influences from there in our food. . . we blend culinary styles and offerings from different African countries, like plantains," says Ghebreyesus. "We also serve Middle Eastern food the region is close to Eritrea. I grew up eating fava beans, and we serve shah (ani Ful, which is an appetizer made of them." 
According to Ghebreysus, this amalgam of influences is what it takes to manage a successful restaurant in an environment where the cuisine is often totally foreign to diners. "For example, we came up with an "Injerrito," he says, pointing to the menu description: a "~burrito" made of injera, lentils, sour cream, and vegetables. «What it really comes down to is a cross-utilization of culture~" he adds. "Food has no boundaries." 


**Title: The Traditionalist**

For most Americans, Eritrean and Spanish cuisines are like strangers or distant relatives; but Chinese food is an old, reliable friend. In a country however, is injera, a spongy pancake-like bread made of a special type of flour that has been fermented in water and fried. Ghebreyesus proudly notes that Adulis makes its own injera every day; the flat bread is used as an accompaniment to a variety of stews, vegetables, and meat entrees. Forgoing the need for silverware, the food can be sopped and scooped with the bread itself, which is ripped apart throughout the meal. 
The process is decidedly unpretentious and, set in a white tablecloth atmosphere, elicits a sense of childish mischief and fun.

**Title: Royal Palace**

The Chins' 87 year-old mother makes dumplings from scratch. 
Tony picks up a copy of the Royal Palace menu, and several inserts fall out. These additional menus, he explains, list the traditional dishes the restaurant serves regional dishes ranging from the spicy Hunan and Szchezuan cuisine to the lighter Cantonese style. 
"We used to give out a single, hand-written version to Chinese families, but then other people wanted to see it, too!" 
He pauses to direct a group of giggling young waitresses clad in traditional scarlet garb, then continues. 
"No two dishes are sauced alike. And we serve authentic options that you wouldn't expect, like honey and walnut shrimp. 
But, with traditional food, our meat is leaner, our vegetables are of greater variety, and our dumplings are lighter." 
With dumplings on his mind, he proceeds to the back room, where his 87 year-old mother is seated in a bulky fur vest, making them from scratch at a table laden with heaps of flour, bowls of ground pork and vegetables, and stacks of paper-thin skins. In her creased, speckled hands, the task appears effortless; she rolls the various components between her fingers in milliseconds, then pinches the results into doughy conch shells. 
As Tony animatedly bounds around the restaurant, pointing to different aspects of the decor the space is airy and bathed in a warm wash of light one of the waitresses prepares a traditional oolong tea ceremony for two. She lays the authentic stoneware on the table, carefully steeps the leaves in a tiny pot, and then empties it into a pair of shot-glass sized cups. 
The quiet, beautiful process encapsulates the essence of Royal Palace. Unlike the culinary architects behind Ibiza and Caffe Adulis, the Chins are wholly devoted to an unadulterated presentation of their heritage; as Tony avows, "We serve and cook what we know, and it's traditional." 
Still, he admits that his adherence to authenticity isn't unbendable. "One of our best dishes, the spicy chicken, is actually called "saliva chicken" in Taiwan." He laughs, then adds, "We probably can't call it that here."

**Title: Success?**

Ken was a handsome executive-type. He drove a red Corvette and took care of Barbie, who arranged playdates for Skipper and Stacey, adored her baby, Polly Pocket, and fussed with her jumpers and updos at least three times daily. As a little girl, I modeled my dolls' family after my real one. 
My dad is a handsome executive-type, and my mother's a gem like Barbie, who is fun, helpful, and employed exclusively as a mother; You might call her a "homemaker," but I prefer "home engineer." 
Few of my friends' mothers worked, and those who did were only gone during school hours. My world did not demand traditional gender roles, but they were the norm. When I played house, I identified with Mommy and Barbie. It was what I knew best. 
It's been years since I've played with Barbie, but I have rarely paused to reexamine the gender conventions I established as a little girl. Then, last September, The New York Times published Louise Story's now notorious article, "Many Women at Elite Colleges Set Career Path to Motherhood." Story, a journalist and student at the Yale School of Management, conducted surveys via e-mail to compile a controversial statistic stating that 85 out of a random sample of 138 females at Yale, or 62%, responded that "when they had children, they planned to cut back on work or stop working entirely." The result was billed as a glimpse into the future of smart young women: At a certain point, a majority will probably want to be mothers, not moguls. The ensuing media frenzy on campus and off saw the article as a setback for women. But for the questions it raised about whether a Yale education entails a professional imperative that stay-at-home-moms fail to meet, I thought it was a lead. 
For me, this article touched on a particular anxiety that may be personal to my generation an anxiety prompted by cultural issues that spanned our childhoods in the 1990s. Between Diane Keaton's fitful exit from corporate America in Baby Boom (1987), the frequent news hour segments that profiled the quickening tick-tock of a woman's biological clock, and interviews of so and so, a female Fortune 500 powerhouse who still felt unfulfilled, from a young age we were exposed to worrisome press about women in the workforce. 
It stirred my fears about the correlation between the privilege and investment of a Yale-education and an obligation to society that motherhood alone fell short of. 
What I was searching for was a Yale-approved paradigm: a model of the modern woman I may want to be. 
Yet the University's generally laudable blindness to its students' sexual orientation and gender leaves it largely unable to address issues like maternity relevant to only a subset of the population. As Yale has constructed valuable genderless stereotypes for me-scholar, leader, citizen I have to wonder how neatly a woman who wants to have children can fit into Kingman Brewster's vision of a Yale class as a "thousand leaders of their generation." I have a feeling a mother can be what Brewster would agree is a leader. I just wish the option was a more visible. 
At Yale, discussions about Story's article were primarily theoretical and frustrating. The points related to junctures the students had not yet confronted, choices we had not yet been faced with.
