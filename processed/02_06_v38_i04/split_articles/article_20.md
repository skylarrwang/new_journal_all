his story could be misconstrued 
to support the notions most peo-
ple have about midwives: uncon-
ventional, placenta-eating relics of a time 
when medical knowledge was 
· · 
at best 
and flat out dangerous at worst And while 
Stone-Godena cheekily combated the stereo-
type by posting a sign reading ''No, You May 
Not Bring Your Dog in To Eat the Placenta" 
on the wall of a birth center where she once 
worked, today's midwives serve a larger and . 
more varied group of patients than the gen-
eral population assumes. Arianna Stein is not 
a nec>-hippie; she is .a midwife herself, who 
wanted to give birth among her own. Her 
husband. is not an uninformed follower of 
alternative medicine; he is a doctor. And 
Stone-Godena herself remembered Gracie's 
birth from her office at the Yale School of 
Nursing, where she is a lecturer, blocks away 
from Yale-New Haven hospital, where she 
practices the majority of her midwifery. 
In the United States, one out of every ten 
babies is delivered by a midwife. In New 
Haven, the percentage is much higher 
one 
out of every three babies at Yale-New Haven 
Hospital is delivered by a midwife. The Yale 
School of Nursing is largely responsible for 
this number. It is one of a handful of institu-
tions in the country that offers a nurse-mid-
wife program, and many of its. graduates 
choose to remain in New Haven. 
Although New Haven is an extreme exam-
ple, midwifery is a common phenomenon in 
the United States. Today's midwives have lit-
tle in common with those mentioned in high 
school history lessons; they are not grizzled 
old women who attend childbirths armed 
only with knowledge accumulated through 
trial and (often fatal) error. Modern mid-
wifery is an extension of conventional medi-
cine; almost all midwives graduate from an 
institutional program like the one at Yale's 
School of Nursing, which trains students as 
midwives and nurses.· Most go on to either 
work at hospitals or join · private obstetrics 
and gynecology practice. 
But in spite of their pervasiveness and 
qualifications, midwives often find' them-
selves struggling to prove their legitimacy to 
patients. "It always comes back to that con-
cept of people who don't know about mid-
wives saying 'Why would you see a mid-
wife? You have private insurance, you have 
enough money to see a doctor,"' said 
Debbie Cibelli, who, along with her busi-
ness partner I jnda Lisk, operates one of 
the few midwife-owned ·practices in 
Connecticut. But while she may be skeptical 
at first, once a woman begins to see a mid-
wife, whether she actively seeks one out or, 
more likely, stumbles across one in a physi-
cian practice, statistics show that she is 
unlikely to return to physician care for 
future childbirths or regular gynecologist 
appointments. Such women value the 
unique kind of care that midwives offer,

physicians are complemented by a degree 
of empathy and personal attention rarely 
found in modern medicine. 


ight years ago, Alycia Clune expe-
rienced what she had believed to 
be impossible: She became preg-
nant. Clune and her husband, Tim, had 
been plagued by severe fertility problems 
and had resigned themselves to not having 
children. When she discovered that she was 
carrying their son, Clune knew that she 
wanted to take every measure to ensure her 
pregnancy's success. Having spent years as a 
nurse in the obstetrics department at 
Bridgeport Hospital, Clune was aware of 
the risks associated with childbirth. But, 
unlike many women in her position, she did 
not want her pregnancy micromanaged by 
physicians, reduced to blood counts, ultra-
sound images, and amniocentesis results. 
She wanted a midwife. 
"I never wanted the people I worked with 
to take care of me," Clune said. She -turned 
instead to Dr. Marshall Holley, ~ the New 
""' 
Haven obstetrician ap.d gynecologist w ho 
first diagnosed the Clune's fertility "prob-' 
lems. In choosing Holley, Clune was not 
simply seeking a doctor outside of her 
workplace. Holley's practice employed two 
midwives, Cibelli and Lisk, who worked 
with him for over twenty years before estab-
lishing their own practice upon his retire-
ment. After observing thousands of babies 
delivered by physicians, Clune had decided 
that she wanted a midwife to be the primary 
attendant at her son's birth. Having seen 
midwives in action, she knew that she would 
be 
receiving excellent medical 
care. 
Moreover, she knew that she would be more 
comfortable in their hands. 
"Everyone tells you that childbirth is nor-
mal, but I saw a lot of women in fear," 
Clune said. "I just saw that there was some-
thing that midwives gave that inspired 
trust." The current trend in obstetrics.-
towards large practices with a multitude of 
-
physicians 
makes it difficult for patients to 
forge personal connections. So, when a 
woman enters the hospital in labor, as Clune 
had observed time after time, she is often 
ten ified. In contrast, every time Clune had 
an appointtnent at Dr. Holley's office, she 
saw either Cibelli or Lisk And during her 
labor, which was overseen by Cibelli, she 
knew exactly whose hands she was in. 
When Clune fina11y went into labor, it last-

around his neck Though he was completely 
healthy, Clune's labor can hardly be character-
ized as easy. Nonetheless, when she remem-
bers it, her first words are in praise of Cibelli, 
who oversaw the birth. 
"She ran the whole room, but without 
seeming like she had an ego;' Clune said 
"She wasn't 
about another patient 
she had, it was just us."

''My husband and I were terrified," she 
added. ''We'd gone through so much. But she 
guided me, and she guided Tim, and kept him 
even keel" 
Two years later and against all odds, the 
Clunes found themselves expecting another 
son. Once again, they chose to have a mid-
wife attend the birth

was on call And once again, complications

Clune panicked.

Clune said. ''I knew too much. At one 
point, Linda took her thumb and put it

that in my twenty years of nursing." 
idwives perform the same 
bloodwork, risk assessments, 
prenatal exams, and ulttasounds 
as physicians; but their draw lies in what they 
provide in addition. ''Physicians are really 
educated in the abnormal, and midwives, 
their education focuses on the normal," 
· Cibelli said. ''We spend much more time talk-
ing about nutrition and the psychological 
aspects of the pregnancy, how it may or may 
not affect the household or the family or the 
other siblings at home, if that's relevant" 
Midwives are taught to view pregnancy as a 
natural condition, not an illness. Thus, they 
are able to view their patients as individuals, 
not cases. 
One of midwives' primary aims is to edu-
cate their patients. The fear that Alycia Clune 
observed in women while assisting deliveries 
is caused by a patients' lack of understanding 
what happens in labor and ignorance of their 
options. For example, many women view 
epidurals, an injection that numbs the body 
from the waist down, as harmless and a nec-
essary relief from the pains of childbearing. 
But epidurals come with risks of their own. 
They achieve their grand effect because anes-
thetic is injected into the fluid surrounding 
the spinal cord, and the procedure c~rries a 
small risk of 
and a larger risk of 
infections, sore backs, and headaches. 
Sometimes, epidurals do not work, leaving a 
certain area or even an entire side of the body 
in pain. And most often, the epidural fails to 
produce the desired numbness that the 
mother-to-be had expected. This is where 
midwives' role as instructors is key. 
''We do a huge amount of education 
before they get there," Stone-Godena said. 
''When the women we take care of ask for 
epidurals, they know what they're asking for. 
They don't just think it's something they've 
read about in a magazine, the be-ali, end-all" 
Thus, if the epidural, or any part of the labor, 
fails to occur as the mother-to-be envisioned, 
she at least understands why, and is spared 
the fear that ignorance can inspire. 
Midwives also include their patients' part-
ners in the process of birth. This is most 
clear in the delivery room itsel£ where mid-
wives take care to include partners in the 
process and often find themselves, as Gbelli 
did with Tim Clune, soothing the partner as 
well as the mother-to-be. Cibelli remetnbers 
one patient whose husband was not pleased 
that his wife was seeing a midwife rather than 
a doctor. 
"He was very uncomfortable with the 
whole thing," she said. But after th.e birth, the 
patient's husband had a radically different 
opinion of midwifery. ''He said to me, "Ibis 
is the first time when I've been at th.e birth of 
one of my children where I didn't feel like I 
was an outsider, that I was encouraged to par-
ticipate, that I felt like the person really knew 
my wife and cared about her." 
Midwives' attention to their patients' part-
ners does not end at birth. Like obstetricians, 
midwives carefully screen their patients to see

if they are at risk for post-partum depression 
and keep close tabs on thdr physical and 
mental health after the baby is hom. And 
while doing so, they extend an eye to their 
patients' partners as well 
"Partners get post-partum depression 
too, so we have to take care of the whole 
family," said Stone-Godena. "I think we 
sometimes forget, because the woman is 
bearing the physical burden and the hor-
monal burden, that sometimes the partner 
has to be strong. And they get fatigued, and 
they have a meltdown, and they aren't able 
to provide what they need for support · 
either. So we have to be prepared to take 
care of all of them, or set them up with 
someone to take care of all of them." 
On some occasions, midwifes simply go 
above and beyond what could reasonably be 
expected of any doctor. After the birth of 
her first child, Alycia Clune developed severe 
mastitis, an in 
tion of the breast that 
renders breast feeding extremely painful. But, 
after giving birth to a child 
the odds, 
she was 
to relinquish any aspect of 
motherhood. Her family did not understand. 
Cibelli did. Rather than refer her to a nurse or 
lactation specialist, Cibelli drove to Clune's 
house to personally assist her with her breast-
feeding. Twice. 
''What physician would do that?" Clune 
asked. 
n New Haven, midwives are a ubiq-
uitous part of OB/GYN practices. 
And some doctors do recognize that 
midwives provide patients with a type of care 
that, for practical reasons, they cannot. Soon 
after she began working alongside Dr. Holley, 
Debbie Cibelli asked him why he chose to 
include midwives in his practice rather than 
hire additional physicians. 
"He said, 'I thought my patients were 
going to get better care if they had that per-
sonaHzed approach and if they actua11y had 
someone that they knew with them when 
they were in labor,' she remembered. "He 
said, 'I'm a physician. I'm not going to sit at 
someone's bedside and rub their back and 
hold the bucket when they throw up. But 
midwives do that, and I think my patients get 
better care because of it."' 
Cibelli characte• izes Dr. Holley as a 
"unique" physician, one who genuinely 
believed that 
care would benefit 
his patients. And while it is ttne that some 
doctors are confident in the level of care 
30 
midwives provide, others are more motivated 
by economic incentives. Instead of seeing a 
midwives as a critical source of comfort-
stroking a patient's hair and murmuring · 
soothing words as she vomits 
they view 
them as people who will be spending time 
with their patient so they can be elsewhere, be 
it in the finanda1ly lucrative operating room 
or on the golf course. A midwife, who can 
perform routine examinations and assist in all

but the most complicated of births, is a far 
less expensive employee than another physi-
cian. Years ago, a small number of physicians 
caught wind of this idea, which spread in a 
domino effect. Now midwives are fixtures in 
many New Haven OB/GYN practices. 
''Whether it's fortunately or unfortunate-
ly, I think that a lot of the time when mid.:. 
wives are hired into physician practices, it's 
because physicians see them as an econom-
ic advantage, not necessarily because they 
buy into the philosophy of midwifery;' 
Cibelli said. 
By and large, midwives in the greater 
United States operate within the same con-
fines as their peers in New Haven: in partner-
ship with a physician. Those striving to oper-
ate in less conventional environments often 
work in alternative birth centers, like those in 
Danbury and Waterbury, which promise a 
less intimidating attnosphere than a hospital's. 
A select few also participate in home-births. 
But midwives are limited by their status as 
nurses, not doctors. They are not qualified to 
perform procedures necessitated by compli-
cated pregnancies, such as Caesarian sections. 
Thus, 
centers and midwives who 
perform home-births limit their work to low-
risk pregnancies, while their counterparts, 
working in hospitals, always have a physician 
in the building who they can turn to if a more 
complex procedure becomes necessary. 
s midwifery has become more 
popular in the United States, the 
number of midwives has natural-
ly blossomed. But, in the past few years, 
growth has halted. ''There's a crisis now;' Teri 
Stone-Godena said. ''Midwifery, not unlike 
nursing as a whole, has become less attractive 
to people who want to have a life, who do 
want to make a good income, and don't nec-
essarily want to be under the threat of a law-
suit for twenty or thirty years after taking care 
of someone." 
Midwifery has been unable to escape 
the malpractice maelstrom that has afflicted 
medicine as a whole over the past decade. 
Because they participate in childbirths, mid-
wives and obstetricians are at risk. for being 
sued years after the actual €oXent. If a heart 
bypass is botched, the effects are immedi-
ately evident. But damage inflicte& by a 
poorly handled childbirth may not manifest 
itself for years. 
''There may be a birth that seems to have 
gone okay, but when the child gets to first 
grade, he or she is not doing very well;' 
Stone-Godena said. "The parents say 'Well, 
you remember it took a little bit longer for 
him to come out than we thought,' or 'You 
knew there was all this excitement in the 
room' and they go back and try to pin down 
the issue that's happening with th~r child." 
''I don't want to make it sound like I think 
that's a commonplace scenario;' she added. 
''I think there's a fear that that's a common-
place scenario." 
In actuality, midwives get sued far less fre-
quently than their physician colleagues, 
because they tend to care for lower-risk 
women, and because of the bond they share 
with their patients. Those midwives who do 
get sued for malpractice are generally those 
who operate closely with physicians and, in 
the event of a suit, get sued along with the 
physician, the hospital, and every other entity 
involved in the birth. 
In spite of this, it is a logistical night-
mare for midwives who are not affiliated 
with a physician or hospit:al to obtain mal-
practice insurance. Debbie Cibelli became 
aware · of this when, after Dr. Holley's 
retirement, she and Jjnda Iisk started
