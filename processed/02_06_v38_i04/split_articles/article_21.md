their own practice and attempted to 
become insured in their own right, without being directly linked to a physician. 
"One of the most challenging aspects of 
starting this practice a year ago was educating 
insurance companies," she said. Few insurance 
companies had ever insured a midwife 
who wasn't employed by a hospital or physician, and though clients had been seeing 
Cibelli and Lisk for twenty years in Dr. 
Holley's office, some companies were hesitant to insure in their new practice. Others 
flat out refused. 

Rather than give up, Cibelli took on the 
role of advocate, both for her own practice 
and for midwifery as a whole. "I had to take 
each insurance company on individually and 
educate them that indeed I did not have to be 
a physician employee to see patients in the 
state of Connecticut," she said. Sometimes a 
conversation wasn't enough. In those cases, 
Cibelli quietly opened a book of legal 
statutes, photocopied relevant pages revealing 
that she was operating within the confines of 
Connecticut State law, and mailed them in 
nearly addressed envelopes to the insurance 
companies. Her perseverance paid off: and 
she and Lisk are now healthcare providers 
under almost every insurance company their 
patients use. Except one: Aetna. 

Lisk and Cibelli have inarguably won 
a victory for midwives by establishing a 
precedent for midwives seeking insurance 
coverage. But the specter of Aetna, 
the one hold-out insurance company 
remains. In her initial struggle to win 
recognition from insurance companies, 
Cibelli did not vehemently pursue Aetna, 
regarding it as somewhat marginal. That 
changed as of January 1; Aetna is now 
the only alternative to the Yale Health 
Plan for Yale employees. Aetna's refusal 
to insure midwives had previously 
inflicted a financial burden on Cibelli 
and Lisk's patients; since the two have 
been operating their practice, their 
patients who are insured by Aetna have 
been forced to pay out of pocket for 
their care. But now it is a question of 
principle: Employees of the Yale School 
of Nursing, where many of New 
Haven's midwives received their training, 
will not be able to rely on their insurance 
to cover visits to Cibelli and Lisk. 

Thanks to Aetna, midwives can no 
longer rely on their insurance to cover 
visits to other midwives.

Alycia Clune, who currently works at the 
School of Nursing, is one of Cibelli and 
Lisk's patients who has been affected by 
Aetna's refusal to recognize them as valid 
healthcare providers. She has joined many of 
the pair's patients in writing letters to the 
company championing Cibelli and Lisk's 
cause, and plans to continue seeing them, 
paying out of pocket, if Aetna continues to 
refuse to back the two. In the years that they 
have cared for her, they have become far 
more than just medical support 
"I believe, for me, having a midwife in your 
life is a gift you give yourself," she wrote in an 
e-mail. "Linda and Debbie are my practitioners, 
but they are so much more. They take the 
role as mom, sister, counselor, whatever is 
needed at the moment."

According to Cibelli, Aetna has made a 
verbal agreement to enroll midwives as 
providers, but has yet to come through on its 
promise. "They're working on it," she said, 
with a hint of skepticism in her voice. In spite 
of the efforts of Clune and other Aetna-
insured patients, the company seems to be 
oblivious to the bond that these women have 
formed with Lisk and Cibelli.
