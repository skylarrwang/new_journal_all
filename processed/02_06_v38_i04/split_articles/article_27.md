At boarding school, the laws of nature had little bearing on the rules governing cross-gender room visits. For freshmen and sophomores at mine, Andover, these "parietals" were a little like legal consultations on Guantanamo: restricted, and very rare. On approximately two and a half Thursdays a month, the genders could intermingle privately for up to two hours, provided an adult was nearby and the bedroom door had been carefully removed from its hinges. By junior year, students were allowed a functioning door that was merely half-open, a slow descent on our innocence. After half-open came the much-anticipated "shoe-in-the-door" phase, when a boy's visit to his lady friend's room was signified by the presence of a shoe, a slipper, socks, or pair of toenail clippers wedged between the door and its frame. At Exeter, Andover's northern rival, administrators also mandated that three of four feet be on the ground. And as at most schools, authority figures could enter the room at will, to note the location of all but the permissibly whorish fourth foot.


The result, for sexually adventurous adolescents, was a lot of creativity.


"Remember that Yale Herald article where some kid talked about hooking up in a chair in his room and how it was so much fun?" a fellow boarding school alum recently asked. "Well, people in my high school used to hook up in chairs that moved back and forth like that except it was, like, in the school auditorium."


Yale, alas, is a different story. Here, in the freedom of co-ed entryways, adventure in the sexual arena is a matter of taste, not necessity. Trysts unfold as far afield as Sudler Hall and the Trumbull dining hall, but they are the exception. And as for the library, another friend reports derisively: "Sex in the stacks has become a total cliche."


Though Yalies are abundantly hard-working, this seems to be one arena where laziness prevails.  It turns out it's just comfortable.


What's happened to us? To boarding school veterans, the problem is obvious: Faced with the university's failure to provide adequate substitutes for the horizontal polka and its three-footed precursors, we've gotten lazy.


Back in the day, things were different. At my high school, the gold medal went to my friend Promiscucia, who gained wide repute for having sex on the lawn behind the Head of School's lush, Victorian home. Once at Yale, I learned from a fellow Andover-turned-Yalie that my friend had actually lost her crown the following year, when two classmates managed the same feat in the Head of School's kitchen. And already, Promiscucia had shared the spotlight with classmates known for hooking up on the altar of one school chapel, behind the organ in another, on the desk of a particularly reviled history teacher, and in a math professor's car.


Of course, these amorous teenagers rose to stardom thanks to boarding schools' smaller size: Like the students, news got around. Everyone at Lawrenceville knew about the boy who would break into his dormmates' rooms and try on their underwear, just like most kids at Exeter knew about the "Harkness Club," founded by students who liked to put the school's famed seminar tables to after-hours use. "There were a lot of members," one alum now at Yale assures me. "Recruitment was not a problem."


In comparison, Yalies seem like old-timers, forced back into the bedroom by the mundanity of near-adulthood. But then, not all of my boarding school friends are eager to turn back the clock.


"Didn't you have way more crazy sex at Andover than at Yale?" I asked one the other day, waxing nostalgic about the good old days of cramped copulation.


"Actually," he replied, "I didn't really have sex in high school… But thanks for making me feel bad about my life."
