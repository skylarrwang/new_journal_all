he interior of the large 
shop is tidy and tastefully 
decorated, even elegant. 
Imitation Tiffany lamps hover on 
various counters, joined by stone 
gargoyles that recall Yale's gothic 
architecture. To the right of the 
lobby, a corner nook is full of 
((' en

books that offer inspiration for tat-
toos. The library 'includes several 
coloring books featuring pictures of 
"prehistoric mammals" or "medici-
nal plants," the full series of' Disney 
Beginning Readers, 
Ranger Rick 1 
Best Friends, The Fami!J Life of Birds, 
A 
Handbook of. Greek Art, and 
Lettering and Lettering Display. The 
lobby and the anterior tattoo area 
are divided by a counter where I sit 
and chat with waiting customers. 
About half the clientele are walk-
ins, the other half appointments. 
Often customers come in with their 
own image in mind, or have an idea 
of what they want and work with an 
artist to design it. Others choose 
from the "flash," the posters of 
commercial tattoo designs that 
hang all over the shop. Behind the 
counter, the tattoo area itself .con-
sists of four stations stocked with 
the necessary needles, inks, and 
miscellaneous jars and bottles. All 
surfaces are gray or black, and look 
sterile and new. This being the week 
before Halloween, occasional plas-
tic skulls accompany the vats of 
vaseline at some of the station.

daily, is a well-run establishment, 
due in no small part to Tyrone's 
management. He's worked here · for 
almost the full decade the shop has 
been around. The company owns 
three other branches in Connecticut 
and Rhode Island. On Chapel 
Street, sometimes an artist will


barter for a tattoo . in exchange for 
another service. -Tyrone explains, 
"You give me your used car, I give 
you a $600 sleeve." (A "sleeve" is a 
tattoo that covers one's whole arm.) 
He 
continues, 
"We 
say we're 
pirates 
you know, 'cuz all they did 
was barter. A . little Chapel Street 
joking thing .. " 


ike the red star on his neck, 
Steve's other tattoos 
or 
"tats" 
recall details of his 
life. He shows me the green flames 
on his thumb, done by Jeffrey when 
the two had just become friends . 
His right arm boasts a bright sun 
held by a darkly-colored Chernabog, 
the villain from Fantasia. The sun 
was done on Steve's 18th birthday; 
only recently did Jeffrey give 
Chernabog some color. "I'm really 
into the old Disney scene," Steve 
tells me. ''And late '80s, early '90s 
TV cartoons. Have you seen the 
new 
image 
of 
Strawberry 
Shortcake? It sucks!" 
Around Steve's neck hangs a red 
tat of a chain and dog-tag, not an 
uncommon design. In bubble let-
ters, the tag reads, "Groove is in the 
-

Heart." Steve has to enlighten me: 
"That's a Delight song. 
It just 
works, because I think music is one 
of the most important things. I like 
dancing, too." His taste in music is 
eclectic: Beatles, The Cure, Biggie 
Smalls, Wu Tang Clan, Beastie Boys, 
Massive Attack, and other electron-
es .

a ve 
ic and trance music. On 'Steye's right 
calf, a red-headed girl lifts u:P:§:·her 
shirt to reveal her midriff. This is 
Steve's own work: "Eventually I'll 
make it really extra-special. .. It's 
gonna take a while 'til I get my own 
style. What I _ really want to do is 
pointillism, shading." He'd like to 
take figure drawing classes so that 
he's "not just copying cartoons and 
Maxim and other shit like that." 
He'd also like to study photography, 
learn to use Photoshop, practice 
piano, take up snowboarding, and 
draw more . 
The first time I met Steve, he 
gave me his trademark handshake, a 
four-step maneuver he picked up a 
decade ago from a friend. He says 
he uses it "with almost everyone, 
even old people." Steve's girlfriend, 
Alyssa, confinns: "He acts goofy 
even with people he doesn't know." 
He makes no pretense of politesse or 
machismo. He eagerly shows me 
designs he's working on for upcom-
ing appointments: a horizontal rose 
rippling the water it lies. on; a nauti-
cal star for Alyssa; the elaborately 
lettered word "MOTIVATION," 
surrounded by stacks of cash and
