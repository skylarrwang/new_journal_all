tographs. Essentially, Haskins is in the 
process of taking pictures of these pic-
tures of pictures. The digitization of this 
entire library is a quest so vast that an end 
date cannot be projected. ''We're in a bit 
of a protean state," Haskins admits, "I 
may have long retired by the time this has 
come to fruition." 

On this day in January, the staff here 
is silently celebrating. Today they reached 
the fifty thou~and image mark, or 50,117 
to be exact, according to the tracker on 
the online database that stores the scans. 
"Quid Tum," Haskins shrugs, quoting 
Alberti, and the department's motto. 
(franslation: ''What next?") 

Of all the Yale libraries to undertake 
digitization, Visual Resources' 
Slide 
Library has the least choice in the matter. 
This past October, I<odak manufactured 
its last 35mm slide projector. The clicking, 
dusty eyes holding vigil in the back of 
Yale classrooms will l::;>e gradually phased 
out, to be replaced with digital projectors. 

he slide library is just one branch 
of the Yale library system that is 
currently 
transitioning 
from 
hard copy videocassettes, magazines, 
books, specimens, oil paintings, Nobel 
prizes, papyri, death masks 
t.o. a digital, 
on-line database. While traditional on-line 
library searches yield only book titles and 
journal dates, over the past ten years 
librarians have sought to digitize complete 
holdings, so that what is on-line is a simu-
lacrum of the entire collection in digital 
images. For example although a scanned 
Edith Wharton manuscript certainly does 
not retain the tactile value of the original, 
the digital form of the manuscript would 
still be very valuable to a scholar in New 
Mexico who is unable to travel to 
Beinecke Library. The slide library is cre-
ating a· digital copy of itself in cyber-
space 
a second library that isn't com-
prised of varnished beechwood drawers, 
but of ones and zeros. 

Digitization is a gradual, painstaking 
process currently unfolding in the back-
rooms and basements of each of Yale's dis-
parate libraries. There is no central digiti-
zation headquarters, as it would be a 
nightmare to move and track all these 
objects. Instead, each library sc~ns or 
photographs its own collection and 
uploads it on-line into a separate search 
engine. Yale's digital library site lists 
twenty different searchable databases-
from the Law School's "Curiae Project," 
which provides Supreme Court briefs in 
fuJl text, to Beinecke's, Yale's largest dig-
ital collection boasting over one-hun-
dred thousand images. Although sepa-
rate teams toil in separate libraries, the 
library system plans to coordinate these 
databases so that in the not-too-distant 
future, a grand database that might inte-
grate Haskins' ambitious slide digitiza-
tion project into Yale's . larger collec-
tions. The final product would be a 
search engine like Google, and a grand 
object in itself that would stand as a 
monument to the breadth of knowledge 
available at Yale. 

This is the next step in a digitization 
project that is just over a decade old. In 
1994, Yale's Project Open Book was 
lauded for its ambitious aim to convert 
ten-thousand texts into digital formats. 

Today, the Beinecke library holds one-
hundred thousand digital images-
including of 12,000 papyri scrolls and 
660 exlorers' maps. The Manuscripts & 
Archives collection, in comparison, 
works on a smaller budget to expand its 
current stock of ten thousand images. It 
has taken Haskins and her team eight 
years to scan the fifty-thousand slides, 
and with 270,000 to go, she often feels 
like an ever-idealistic Sisyphus as she 
clicks through the slides in a drawer. 
"We acquire more images per year than 
we currently digitize," she said. 

o translate a slide from a tiny 
plastic window into the lan-
guage of pixels, Haskins sends 
orders downstairs where, amid the old 
stone of Street Hall's 1870s basernent, a 
bank of Eames chairs float around a cof-
fee table stacked with issues of Wired 
magazine. This is Yale's Media Services 
division, 
which hired Photographic 
Services Manager Joseph Szaszfai as a 
photographic assistant in 1964 to shoot 
Museum exhibitions for print catalogues 
and posters. Szaszfai has spent the past 
thirty years shooting the slides that com-
prise the Slide Library's upstairs collec-
tion, and his new role almost seems like a 
renunciation of his old work. This past 
academic year, his team at Media Services 
was responsible for creating "J9 ,000 digital 
images for use by faculty in class or p~_bli­
cation, many of which were digital copies 
of slides he shot himself. 

"This team has basically gone from sil-
ver to pixels," says Media Services 
Director Peggy McReady with visible 
enthusiasm. ''We still produce images, but 
five percent are requested on traditional 
film base, and 95 percent are requested as 
digital. That's the opposite of what it was 
four or five years ago." 


'~For some reason," Szaszfai agrees, 
"It's all happening this year." This sum-
mer, Media Services sent out a pamphlet 
to Yale Faculty encouraging more senti-
mental professors to "go digital," to 
request digital im~es for class and lap-
tops to play them on. ''There are folks 
that have been here for years and years 
and years, but they may have to change," 
Szaszfai said. 'These projectors are going 
to break, and there won't be another way 
to do things." 

With changing technology, the layout 
of Media Services is also changing. The 
computer lab Szaszfai careens through 
was once a screening room for 16mm 
projectors. A darkroom down the hall is 
shuttered and empty. ''Just today a guy 
came by and turned off the water." By 
July 1, 2006, the division, which for the 
past forty years has printed photographs 
chemically, will be run entirely through a 
networked system of computers and 
printers. The basement's pride and joy is 
Kodak scanner that can scan an entire 
carousel 
at a rate of 85 slides per hour. 

On a Wednesday in January the entire 
basement is empty but for two technicians 
hud<;iled in a windowless nook the size of 
a bathroorp., gathered around a large com-
puter scrtren~--They watch as the machine 
whizzes thr-ough a carousel of .images of 
Italian architec~e. 

Once ~~e' sfu:l~~ ~are digitized, they'll 
first be handed, <iV~ to the professor, 
either via e-QiftY:-· ot on ' a data disc. 
Secondly, they'll be sent upstairs to 
Haskins. Her team will upload the images 
into one of several databases and will 
enter alongside what librarians call. "meta-
data," a string of information about the 
image 
such as its artist and ditnen-
sions 
that allows the image to be search-
able in a larger database. 

But few undergrads, unless stron-
garmed by an art history course, know 
that the resource even exists. "Currently, 
to find what they're looking for, students 
are forced to wend their way by human 
beings," says Katie Bauer, a former New 
Haven math teacher who was hired by 
SML under the daunting title 
of 
"Integrated Interface Systems Librarian." 
Her job was to procure and coordinate 
electronic databases like LexisN e:xis from 
vendors. Today, Bauer, along with Jennifer 
Weintraub, a classically-trained librarian 
who fondly recalls learning Netscape 1.0 
in Library School, is working on a project 
called "D PIP." 

"I was trying this whole time we were 
siu iog here to think of what it stood for," 
Bauer 
admits. 
"Digital 
Production 
Integration Program?" The program aims 
to integrate the images that Haskins' team 
uploads with all of Yale's digital collec-
tions. Currently, digital holdings in the
February 2006 
Beinecke division of Sterling Memorial 
must be searched through a separate data-
base from Manuscripts & Archives' hold-
ings. Though Yale's libraries will always be 
a "decentralized system, no matter what," 
Bauer says, "clearly we need to build 
something to coordinate groups." 

As far as librarians go, Bauer and 
Weintraub are particularly progressive. 
"Librarians are critical that students will 
only use what's available digitally," Bauer 
says, "They say it's a bad thing that 
Google is so easy, and that people are get-
ring spoiled." Most librarians would agree 
that students should "wend their way" 
through the system that's been in place for 
years 
mastering card catalogues, toying 
with Orbis. ''But when a student asks 
'Why don't we just have something like 
Google, that searches all the information 
systems, or something like Amazon that 
recommends other books or sources,' it's 
hard to give an explanation. The answer is, 
we should be using these techniques. We 
have a lot to learn from what students 
already know." _DPIP hopes to integrate 
all digital holdings into one search engine. 
''You'll type 'GertrUde Stein"' Weintraub 
explains, "and you'll get images and text 
from all libraries." 

ibrarians are also wary of how 
simplifying the process may 
affect scholarship. 'There's a 
fear that if some images are on-line, those 
will be the only images students u e," 
Weintraub explains. ''They'll never go 
looking further." Currently, Yale doesn't 
have the capability to digitize every library 
holding, so libraries must prioritize what 
gets translated into a new format, instead 
of pursuing a wholesale conversion. They 
first digitize items· requested by scholars, 
then scan items that receive the most use 
(freeing up librarians who would other-
wise spend time pulling those items); their 
next order of business is to scan items 
that are monetarily valuable apd thus 
more likely to be stolen 
like. the jewel-
encrusted fraternity pins currently being 
digitized at M&A. Finally, they scan items 
that are so perishable, digiti.zation serves 
as a mode of preservation. 

Because of the extent to which digiti-
zation depends on demand, librarians 
worry that it will negatively affect scholar-
ship by creating what Weintraub describes 
as "a self-perpetuating cycle": The images 
that get more use will become the easiest 
to access and thus will get even more use~ 
Just as an art historian fears for the 
integrity of copied images, so too librari-
ans fear that a digital database will provide 
a false picture. "The worry is that this will 
become a 'greatest hits' collection," says 
Richard 
Szary, 
the 
Director 
Manuscripts & Archives, who last year 
was recognized by the Society of 
American Archivists as one of the "quiet 
giants of the profession." 

''What's on-line is just such a small por-
tion of the actual collection, and is com-
pletely unrepresentative," he says modest-
ly from a low-ceilinged back office of the 
gothic Manuscripts & Archives depart-
ment of Sterling Memorial Library. "What 
we need to deal with is wholescale digiti-
zation, which· requires a wholesale opera-
tion we're not equipped to handle. But 
currently, this is a skewed picture of a col-
lection." A search for Eero Saarinen, the 
architect of Morse and Ezra Stiles 
College, brings up 179 hits. "It's just total-
ly skewed," he stresses, ''We probably 
have ten thousand." 

' 
"Our collection is enormous," says 
Matt Shirley, the Digital Imaging Project 
Manager for Beinecke, "but when you 
think of someone's archives in a box as 
hundreds of separate images, this is a very 
small portion of our collection." Shirley's 
team photographs abou.t fifty items per 
day, though he explains that "3D is much 
slower. Busts, swords, medallions, death 
masks, and Nobel prize medals take a lot 
of time." Translating the image of a three-
dimensional object onto a two-dimen-
sional on-line database is its own chal-
lenge, and is the most obvious example of 
what is lost when students and scholars 
neglect the original object for the facility 
of a digital image. 

Still, librarians are already noticing 
that resources are getting used by a 
broader audience. When Rebekah Irwin, 
the catalog librarian for the Digital 
Projects division, entered data to 
describe "Unknown Man from Alaska," 
an 1890s photograph of an Inuit, she 
couldn't upload very much "metadata" 
because she didn't know very much 
about the image. Months later, she 
received an email from a Juneau, Alaska 
man who could barely restrain his glee at 
finding an image of his relative online: 
(The image is of Rudolph and Dai.ry Walton 
and famify, ca. 1890 ... This is the on!J known 
photograph of the. Walton fomi!J and its discov-
ery was met with much excitement among the 
Walton fami!J in Sitka, who had never seen a 
photo of their grandmother, aunt and uncles (all 
of whom died young). " 

This is one of the scholarly outcomes 
that exemplify why Irwin and her collabo-
rators at the Beinecke laud the new digital 
database. "Correspondences like these are 
very rewarding," Irwin wrote in an e-mail. 
"In this case, the digital reproduction of a 
rare photograph transcended the four 
walls at the library and as a result, we now . 
have a deeper understanding... based on 
the shared insight of a far-;flung user of 
our collection. Researchers often,.help 
interpret items in our collection:" she 
added, "that is not new. What is neW, how-
ever, is the eliminiation of the space and 
time constraints of traditional libraries." 

By widening access to these materials 
without causing damage to the originals, 
the Beinecke digitization team is fulfllling 
a two-fold goal of deepening scholarship 
about the materials within the collections 
while simultaneously broadening the 
viewing audience for that collection. 

nlike Haskins, who is chiefly con-
cerned with digitizing an analog 
resource 
convertiflg slides.-
Szary is building a digital collection from 
analog and other media with digital origi-
nals. ''What do you do," he asks, "when a 
writer's correspondences that they donate 
to the library aren't on a piece of paper 
anymore, but they donate a collection of e-
mails? How do you preserve,She order they 
were sent in? Where do you put the e-mails, 
how do you ensure that they aren't tam-
pered with, how many copies do you make 
and do you save them on a CD or on a 
server? Nothing lasts forever," he says, 
"But it's hard to know what will last at least 
a long time. We don't want any 8-tracks or 
Word 4.0 flles, because nothing we have 
can access them."
