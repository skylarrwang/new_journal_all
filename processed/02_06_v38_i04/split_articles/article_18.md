joined sun and moon for an 
imminent appointment. He puts 
his 
drawing 
of 
the 
design 
between two sheets of chemical-
ly-coated paper, then runs the 
three sheets through a machine 
that makes transparencies. Out 
comes a purple print between the 
chemical-sheets. Steve will press 
this against the skin of the client. 
She arrives: Cindy, a cute 
blonde in her late twenties. She is 
cheerful, giggly, and dressed for a 
Gap ad. She is here for a cover-up 
of a moon on her belly, a tat she 
got in 1994. Cover-ups, along with 
tats that circumscribe the upper 
arm, are the bane of every tattoo 
artist. The latter requires an 
extremely calm, still patiet; a 
cover-up demands that the artist 
have great skill and humility. One 
needs skill to transform the origi-
nal design, and humility to face 
altering another artist's vision. 
Steve has designed a half-moon 
to fit over Cindy's faded crescent. 
H e takes a "before" photo of the 
crescent, then attempts to line up 
his print over the tat. He cleans 
Cindy's faded moon with rubbing 
alcohol, then swipes clear deodor-
ant over the skin so the print will 
stick. The print lines up only after 
three tries. Steve makes a new 
print and re-cleans the skin for 
each attempt. After the successful 
fourth try, Steve takes up the out-
lining needle and traces the purple 
print. Cindy does not flinch, 
reporting to me that "it doesn't 
really hurt, just feels a little irritat-
ing, like an ongoing bee-sting." 
After outlining, Steve switches to 
the coloring needle. Every trickle 
of color is dabbed and wiped with 
a paper towel. Soon Cindy's stom-
ach looks like a finger-painting 
project. Steve wipes another towel 
over the chaos, to clean away 
excess ink. Color stays only where 
the needle has actually touched the 
skin. When the tat is finished, 
Steve disinfects the needles in a 
hot sterilizing solution and throws 
them out. 
"In the old days, we used nee-
dles over and over," Ralph once 
tOld me with nostalgia. But 
Tyrone is proud of the cleanliness 
and safety of his parlor, which 
forbids pets, food, and smoking. 
Any impurity in the air might 
taint the ink, which in turn infects 
the bloodstream. Steve takes 
Cindy outside to look at her tat-
too in sunlight, and Sebastian 
comes along to approve the job. 
Once back indoors, Steve takes an 
"after" photo of that tat to add to 
his album of work. He then cov-
ers the sun and moon with 
Vitamin A and D ointment and 
tapes gauze over the ta>t with 
band-aids. He hands Cindy pack-
ets of the ointment to apply to 
the area for three to four days 
after. Cindy is clearly pleased with 
Steve's work. She thanks him and 
says goodbye. 


H 
ello," announces a cus-
tomer to Steve one day. 
He is a 
middle-aged 
black man with bulging, tat-cov-
ered arms. He is at once solemn 
and frustrated. "I had an appoint-
ment 
for 
right 
now 
with 
Sebastian, and he's not here. I 
need this tat. I just got back from 
my mother's funeral." He is here 
for the day from Florida, and 
Sebastian is the only tat artist he 
works 
anywhere. 
But 
Sebastian apparently forgQt the 
appointment. The man wants the 
image of praying hands (modeled 
after Durer's sculpture) entwined 
with a rosary tattooed on his 
upper arm. All the artists at The 
Edge 
know 
ho~ 
to 
do this popular image, but Steve 
is reluctant to take Sebastian's 
client. 
The fellow is desperate:

"Please, man. Make it special for 
me. Dude, I don't move." Steve 
considers a bit, and agrees to 
design the tat. He retreats to his

that I am the person he's talking to. 
I ask the man the same question 
I've been asking everyone at The 
Edge: Can you tell me about your 
tattoos? He extends his right arm 
near me, holding it so I can see a 
large cross on his biceps with 
names on each limb. "You see this?

you put that on your arm, that's 
total devotion." Then he starts 
weeping, pauses, and keeps talking. 
His eyes dry as he talks. 
His name is Chet McGill. He 
shows me his right arm, on which 
sprawls one of Sebastian's designs, 
an eagle killing a snake. "See, 
Sebastian thinks of me as a war-
rior 
an eagle 
because that rep-
resents strength." And there is 
precedent for his getting a tattoo in 
memory of a loved one: When 
Chet's Cherokee grandmother died, 
Sebastian designed a tattoo of 
an Indian on a horse for Chet's 
upper back, the Indian's head down 
1n mourn1ng. 
Steve finishes Chet's design in 
about twenty minutes. Chet has 
invited me to watch him get the 
tat, so I perch on Steve's counter 
to watch him work. His job right 
now seems enormously important. 
This would-be nurse and dedicat-
ed artist with a natural bedside 
manner is far from the old-school 
bully-tattooer. He rolls up Chet's 
sleeve and begins to tattoo the 
praying hands.
