Steve traces a tattoo design wi'th attention. Thi's first step i'n the process allows tattoo artists the most freedom. 
getting one voluntarily indicates 
dominance and power. Tattooing, 
like prostitution, concerns control 
of one's body and, by extension, of 
one's identity. 


In America, the popularity of 
tattooing has been on the rise since 
the mid-19th centuiy. N ev.ertheless, 
it has been subject to its fair share 
of scorn. During World War I, the 
Navy banned tattoos, with the 
desired result of a healthier crew, 
and the unintended result of new 
recruits 
wearing 
corsets 
and 
camisoles to cover their chest 
tats. In the 1920s, the conservative, 
law-obsessed impulse that 
bred 
Prohibition 
prompted 
many 
American cities and states, includ-
ing New York, to outlaw tattooing 
altogether. 


Since the 1980s, American tat-
too culture has been shedding its 
exclusive associations with rebels 
and bikers. People with tattoos are 
now as likely to drive a Volvo as a 
Harley, and artists are as likely to 
be MFA candidates in need of a job 
as ex-cons in need of a pay stub. 


Today, a tattoo indicates an 
aspect of one's identity more than 
it does rebellion. In the days after 
9/ 11, Tyrone and his crew gave 
free· tattoos memorializing the 
event. They were overwhelmed the 
abundance of people, many of 
whom were first-time tattooees, 
wanting flags, eagles, the Twin 
Towers, and even the planes crash-
ing 
into 
the 
towers. 
HUs 
Americans," 
says Tyrone, 
'·'We 
don't want to be left out of some-
thing, and we want to show our 
heritage. So we get tats." 


What accounts for this main-
streaming? Perhaps in such an 
unsettled political ·climate, people 
get tats because they offer some-
thing permanent in a world in flux. 
Perhaps Americans love to catego-
rize themselves. Or perhaps people 
get tats to invite conversation. At 
least, these are some of the theories 
academics propose. In the last ten 
years, as much ink has been spilled 
writing about tattooing as has been 
used in tattoos themselves. Not 
only are there a dozen tattoo maga-
zines, but scholars have pounced on 
the subject, writing books such as 
Bodies of Inscription: A 
Cultural 
History 
of 
Modern 
Tattoo 
Community and Mutilating the Bot!J: 
Identity in Blood and Ink. There are 
several country-specific histories of 
tattooing, and several accounts of 
the connection between tattooing 
and the sea-trade. And although tat-
tooing has vaulted into the special-
ized world of academia, it is a rare 
Yalie who moves 
beyond the 
anthropologic study of a tattoo and 
actually gets one. Most of the cus-
tomers at this New Haven parlor, 
one block from campus, are from 
outside the University system. 


had feared tough-guy postur-
ing when I first ventured to 
The Edge, but I do not find 
much. The second time I come into 
the shop, Tyrone tells Coniah, one 
of his main artists, "Be nice to 
Emily, here." Coniah, ~s-tuoent at 
Paire Arts School, seems suspicjous 
but soon warms up. When a cus-: 
tomer asks if I am there to get tat-
tooed, Coniah jokes, "We'll strap 
her to a chair soon enough." And 
Sebastian, a 32 year-old, unusually 
talented, handsome, and wisecrack-
ing artist with whom I had original-
ly met some resistance, adds, "She's 
from Yale 
they're sending their 
spies down here!" 


One Wednesday, as I watch 
Ralph, another artist, tattoo a drag-
onfly onto the left wrist of a 55 
year-old woman, he asks me why I 
wanted to write about The Edge. 
Many customers and other artists 
here have asked me this, and have 
been intrigued when I've told them, 
"I wanted to explore the tattoo 
world because it's totally foreign to 
me." I have been flattered when 
customers have assumed I am there 
to get a tattoo myself. Real(y, me? 
Thank goodness, I don't look like a total 
square! But I should not be so flat-
tered: A?ryone might get a tattoo 
these days, even a 55 year-old social 
worker with big glasses and a grand-
motherly haircut. Ralph is not
