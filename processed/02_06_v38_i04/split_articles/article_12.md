"I
was walking down Chapel Street one day two years ago,"
Steve Maler explains to me at The Edge Tattoo Parlor,
-
which bo!ders the New Haven Green. "~nd I thought, 'I
need to get a red star tattooed on my neck.' So I walked in
here, and this guy Jeffrey gave me the star, and we became
good friends."
Steve is 26, white, and remarkably tall and thin. When he walks, he floats,
leaning forward a bit and striding slowly. The Adam's apple on his skinny neck
bobs as he speaks. The star on the neck symbolizes nothing; Steve simply thought
it would look cool. Indeed it does, while announcing both whimsy and daring:
One's neck, unless it's very muscled, is a particularly painful place to get tattooed.
When Jeffrey noticed that Steve was always drawing and doodling, he
taught hitn how to tattoo at home. Later, The Edge offered Steve a job, so he hap-
pily quit his post at an aluminum factory to become a professional tattoo artist.
He's been at The Edge since last February, and is delighted with his life now: "I
love coming to work every day, while I used to hate it."
