• rotary phone sits perched on a bunny's 
bedside table, ready to receive my call. The 
ring is too quiet, however, to wake the 
bunny or the quiet old lady whispering 
"hush" 
from their imaginary slumbers. 

With its windows looking out onto the 
snowy corner of Wall and Orange Streets, 
the great, green room from Margaret Wise 
Brown's beloved children's bedtime clas-
. . 
sic, Goodnight Moon, is replicated in full-
scale. The view of the sidewalk is 
obscured by sheets of blue plastic with 
cutaway stars and the moon, a simulation 
of what the book's characters would see 
from their drowsy, rocking recline. The 
green walls are home to the two gray 
stuffed animal rabbits, two little kittens, a 
pair of mittens, a marble fireplace, green-
• 
and-yellow striped curtains, and all the 
other objects familiar to generations of 
small chilqren:

um, I try

again, only to be quickly 
hung up on by a three year-old girl 

The museum that she and I spend our 
morning enjoying was born, according to 
Director Sandra Malmquist, in "a series of 
Inspiration Meetings, held from February 
through July 2000." At these sessions, a 
diverse group of community members,---
parents, builders, teachers, legislators, at rists, 
and naturalists 
met to craft a theme for 
each of the building's eight rooms. The 
museum is based on Harvard psychologist 
Howard Gamer's Theory of Multiple 
Intelligences 
each of the rooms is dedicat-
ed to one of the eight intelligences Garner 
articulated: Musical, Logical-Mathematical, 
Spatia\, Interpersonal, lntrapersonal, Bodily-
Kinesthetic, · 
· tic, and Naturalist. 

The great, green room is the · 
nc 
room, and exists thanks to a perceptive New 
Havener who noticed the uncanny resem-
blance between the room's existing fireplace 
and the one drawn almost sixtf years ago by 
Oement Hurd, the book's illustrator. After 
this discovery, Malmquist said, ''It became 
February 2006 
immediately dear that re-creating the great, 
green room from Goodnight Moon would be 
an entirely magical process resulting in a 
totally magical product." 

Several months, a conversation, and a let-
ter 
to 
Goodnight 
Moon's 
publisher 
HarperCollins later, the great, green room 
opened its bedroom door to the public. 

The room caters to a large portion of that 
public. Spanish, French, Korean, Japanese, 
and Hebrew editions of Goodnight Moon are 
shelved alongside the original, while the large 
pieces of plastic and metal type that line the 
magnetic walls with words from the book 
are 
underscored by Braille lettering. 

Malmquist describes the "inclusion of chil-
dren with disabilities" as "a cornerstone of 
our work and our museum." Many of the 
children's books have also been Brailled, and 
an American Sign Language alphabet puzzle 
sits next to a Perkins Braille typewriter on the 
bunny's desk. 

In its twin goals of bringing to life a fic-
titious environment and fostering the lin-
guistic intelligence of its visitors, the trans-
formation of the great, green room from 
two dimensions into three has been an 
immense success. Creating Readers, a litera-
cy program run out of the museum, builds 
on children's enchantment by distributing 
copies of picture books to its visitors, 
drawn from the community-at-large. Over 
the last five years, the museum has given 
away more than 25,000 works in English, 
Spanish, and Braille. 

Barraged by screaming toddlers, I muse 
on a story of the book's republication. While 
older editions' back covers sport a photo of 
the illustrator, Hurd, flicking a cigarette, cur-
rent HarperCollins editor Kate Jackson 
obtained permission from his son to-digital-
ly remove· the cig. But the younger Hurd was 
ultimately unhappy with the final product, 
saying that the altered photograph of his 
father's extended, empty hand ''looks slight-
ly absurd to me." 

In the same way, the museum's revised 
edition lacks some necessary element. 
Something, I think, resting my hand on the 
bunny's bedside table, is missing. A certain 
pat ticular essence... a certain keystone. 

Here, beside the comb and the brush, I pick 
up the red plastic bowl full of mush. But, for 
obvious practical reasons, the bowl is empty. 
So too, at night, after the children have gone, 
is the room.
