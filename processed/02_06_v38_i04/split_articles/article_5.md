A Long Exposure 
AT A UTILE PASf NOON, 1HE PHatOGRAPHER 
unloads his apparatus from a car parked 
at the foot of Harkness Tower. He lugs 
a great wooden box and tripod over to 
the High Street gate, sets up the camera, and 
trains it at ~ th~ ·gate. He made this camera 
obscura 2'a gorgeous and intricate piece of 
red woodwork 
by himself a few years ago, 
drawing on carp€pttys kills he picked up as 
a Yale undergrad~~te. ~ the '70s. Only the 
Voightlander ley~fdtl~ding from the cam-
era and the tri~d it sfts atop are not of his 
· own making. 
Nate Gibbons is a sturdily built man with 
. ·a thick, redcij:sh moustache. He wears a 
white wool hat, heavy-duty boots, and a 
workman's apron. Nato 
as he prefers to 
be called 
is showing me how to make a 
tintype, an early photographic process that 
was eclipsed in the late 1800s by paper 
prints. A few decades ago, finicky Civil War 
re-enactors were the only ones still practic-
ing the craft (albeit clumsily, Nato suggests). 
''They kept it alive when it might've other-
wise died out ... " His voice trails off as he 
opens up the trunk of his car. ''But nothing 
dies forever," he adds brightly, reaching for 
a small metal plate. 
Becau~e wet-plate photography must 
be processed within minutes of exposure, 
Nato has converted the rear of his Chevy 
into a portable darkroom. It is filled with 
jugs, vials, plexiglass trays, and wooden 
boxes. Over the course of the day, I pick 
up the names of the panoply of chemicals 
and learn that many are dangerous. Nato 
wears gloves and goggles; his shirt is 
stained in many places, and, were he not 
careful, the same could happen to his skin. 
''The irony of this beautiful art form," he 
~ays, "is that you deal with stuff that can 
blind the photographer."

In the age if digital photograpf?y, wf?y make tin!JPes at all? 
· He coats a five by seven inch metal plate 
with gun cotton, an emulsion, then sensi-
tizes the plate in a silver solution for three 
minutes. For a moment, he peeks out and 
looks toward the gate. ''The cam-era still 
there?" he asks, and then g rins at what he 
sees. He chuckles a bit: Two amorous stu-
dents are kissing beside his camera. ''Ah, to 
be young again ... " he says, fitting the ready 
plate into a plateholder. 
Once die lovers have departed, Nato 
slips the plateholder into his camera, 
removes the lens cap, and counts to 15. He 
replaces the lens cap, takes out the plate-
holder, and heads back to the little dark-
room. After strapping a small red headlamp 
around his forehead, he promises to be 
''back in a jiffy" and disappears unden1eath 
the dark cloth to develop the plate. 
He 
emerges a few minutes later to fix the image 
by pouring cyanide solution over it. This, he 
explains, can be the most dangerous part of 
the process for a careless photographer: 
"D eveloper is acidic, and acid releases 
cyanide gas from the solution," he explains. 
He's heard of a few accidental deaths. 
A student with a camera slung around 
her neck approaches p.s and shyly asks 
Nato if she can take a picture of the artist 
at work. She raises the Nikon to her eye 
and presses a button. Her camera's shut-
ter flits open for a thirtieth of a second, 
then closes. She thanks us and walks away. 
Nato returns to work. 
What could drive a man to spend weeks 
fumbling through 19th century treatises on 
photochemistry, as Nato did, struggling to 
figure out what "drams" and "scruples" and 
"soda pop of ash" refer to? What could 
make him devote months to constructing 
cameras from scratch, and then spend over 
a year experimenting with those cameras 
before he had anything to show for it? Why 
would anyone make tin~es at all in the age 
of digital photography? ·Is it simple nostal-
gia 
or maybe masochism? · 
It is neither. Nato has little concern for 
history, and no interest in emulating the 
Civil War re-enactors who preserved the 
craft most had forgotten. He doesn't hesi-
tate to use an electronic egg timer or other 
21st century gadgets that seem oddly incon-
gruous with his otherwise historically accu-
rate outfit. 
He even affixes footwarmer 
heat-packs to the bottle of developer, since 
he worries that the January weather might 
impede optimal development. Though he 
uses a lens from the 1850s, he says he'd be 
glad to use a modern one, if he could afford 
it. Voightlander, which he calls the "Nikon 
of its day," made heaps of fine lenses that 
no one uses anymore, and he picked this 
one up on eBay for sixty bucks. 
If it isn't nostalgia driving him, then 
might it be a devotion to craft? This could 
be the answer to the riddle, as suggested 
when another passerby engages Nato in 
conversation. "The problem;' says the man, 
who works at Yale Media Services, "is that 
everyone with a camera's a photographer 
these days." 
Nato corrects him politely: 
'~yone can take a picture 
not everyone's 
a photographer." 
But Nato also debunks the notion that 
laborious artisanship is necessary to pro-
duce a great photograph: Snapshots, he tells 
me, can be art too. Far from denigrating 
modern photographic techniques, Nato 
reveals that he even uses a digital camera on 
occasion. ''People sometimes ask me, 'If 
you could achieve the exact same results 
with a digital camera and a computer, would 
you do it?' I'd sure as hell try." In fact, he 
almost pursued digital photography instead 
of historic processes 
a decision he felt had 
to make five years ago. 
Nato is ready with the fixer. As the 
chemicals do their· work, the image transi-
tions from negative to positive; the dark sky 
fades to a pale grey, ~d the spectral white of 
the gate thickens into a solid black. Nato 
gives me the tintype to hold, and I see the 
incredibly rich detail that only a polished 
metal surface can register. The image has the 
ghostly beauty peculiar to historic wet-plate 
processes. Here, at last, is evidence for why 
Nate Gibbons pursues such an antiquated 
· art form; ''It's all about the image," he says. 
He finds the work of art that results from 
the historic process to be of superior beauty. 
As Nato packs up his apparatus, I ask 
him what happened five years ago to force 
his decision between digital and historic 
processes. 
I am expecting a quick and 
ready answer, like he usually gives 
prob-
ably something about a special develop-
ment in digital technology around 2001. 
Instead, Nato is quiet for a while, then 
answers very carefully. "I got to a point 
where I saw that, realistically, I only had 
15 years left of professional life to devote 
to a single craft," he says. 
Nato is 49 now: ''I've got the five-zero 
staring me in the face like a nine r:pill.ipeter," 
he says solemnly. Ever since Re .first took 
Introduction to Photography at Yale,_.,_ art 
photography has been his passion 
bpt he 
never sold a single photograph, not in 25 
years. Fortunately, his gamble on historic 
processes has finally brought him a small 
measure of success: He has at last attracted 
some attention to his photography, and last 
year he sold a few tintypes. But Nato figures 
that he is only covering his expenses with 
what he sells. ''I'm not about to quit my day 
job," he admits. Nato worked for the New 
Haven Register for a while when he got out 
of college; now he supports himself as a fire 
inspector in Westport. 
The photographer loads his equipment 
back into his Chevy. It's a little ·past four; the 
sun is too low for picture-taking now, and he 
has several images of the gate already 
a 
good day's work With another kind of cam-
era, he might easily have filled an entire mem-
ory card in the same four hour span. But a 
good photograph, Nato knows, takes time.
