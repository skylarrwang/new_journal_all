While we talk, Jess, th,e only 
female artist at The Edge comes 
over. She is short and tough-look-
ing, often glowering. ''Whatcha 
doin'? ," she asks Steve.


"Eating dinner." 

Jess gives him the finger. She 
later tells me, "Steve and I 
understand each other. He's 
unique. He wears women's sun-
glasses 
yellow tinted, pink, or 
sparkly." Steve loves to sail fris-
bees 
across 
Chapel 
Street. 
He rides down steep hills in a 
roily chair. 

When asked to describe 
S'teve, his close friend Farleigh 
recitt;S _the nonsense sounds 
"Mao mao mao," like an incanta-
tion, 
the~ .. 
explains, 
"This

he has nQ'tliifl.gelse 'to say. And 
when he picks up the phone, 
he'll say random words or stut-
ter, 'Hey, hi, hello, hey, hi, hi.' ... 
He's 
a good guy." Tyrone, 
the manager of The Edge, says, 
·"He's such a calm individual, 
he's a pleasure to work with. 
An old-school tattoo 
artist 
would say to me, 'Who · the hell 
are you?"' 

Tyrone, a fit, short 35 year-
old black man with several facial 
piercings and arm tattoos, offers 
this recent history of the busi-
ness: "Ten years ago, tattooing 
wasn't something to do. Now, I 
get doctors, lawyers, judges. If 
you don't have one, it's like 
not having a vehicle. It's like"-
and then he assumes a high, 
incredulous voice 
"'You ain't 
got a car?l' 'You ain't got a tat-
too?! Why not?"' 

"Old school" tattoo artists 
come from a lineage- of to1;1gh 
guys 
and 
troublemakers. 
Tattooing came to Europe after 
mid-16th century. sailors encoun-
February 2006 
tered the art among Polynesian 
islanders. 
Later, tattooing was 
practiced mainly by marginalized 
groups, such as circus perform-
ers, criminals, and French revo-
lutionaries. The first mention of 
the word "tattoo" in English lies 
in the journals of the British 
Captain James Cook, who sailed 
around the Pacific and spent 
time with the Tahitians. In 1769, 
he wrote, "Both sexes paint their 
Bodys, Tattow, as it is called in 
their Language. This is done by 
inlaying the Colour of Black 
under their skins, in such a man-
ner as to be indelible." In the 
Tahitian language, Tattow means 
"the results of tapping or strik-
ing." Cook's recording of the 
word coincided with the rising 
trend among European sailors, 
so it stuck. 

In the East, like in Polynesia, 
the custom has traditionally been 
associated with spirituality; in 
the West, with subversion. The 
early Jewish, 
Christian, 
Muslim traditions all prohibited 
tattoos, and both the ancient 
Judea-Christian 
Greco-
Roman cultures associated tat-
tooing with barbarians, slaves, 
and the poor. To be tattooed 
indicated that one was under 
someone 
else's 
power. 
Supposedly, the Roman emperor 
Caligula once commanded all of 
his citizens to get tattooed, pure-
ly for his entertainment. Two 
thousand years later and halfway 
around the world, the Patau 
Islanders in 1832 forced the cap-
tured American sailor Horace 
Holden to endure full-body tat-
tooing. While Caligula's citizen 
had no recourse but to oblige 
their sadistic ruler, back home in 
New Hampshire, Holden wrote a 
bestseller about his experience. 
Just as being forced to get a 
tattoo indicates subservience
