I PA S BENEATH THE GAZE OF ELIHU YALE 
at least five time_s daily. Perched atop 
the upper tiers of Harkness Tower, 
Yale's namesake resides on High Street. 
While I often frequent this section of 
the street, our encounters had, until 
recently, occurred unbeknownst to me. 
Luckily, Eli has plenty of other histori-
cally important figures to keep hitp. 
company: . Jonathan 
Edwards, 
Eli 
Whitney, John Calhoun, and Nathan 
Hale also adorn the tower's heights. 

James Gamble Rogers, the architect 
behind much of Yale's gothic genius, 
including Harkness Tower, incorporat-
ed a variety of statues into its construc-
tion. Aristotle and Homer are immor-
talized in the tower's design, as are alle-
gorical representations of Justice, Life, 
Progress, and Death. Rogers modeled 
Harkness after St. Botolph's Priory in 
Boston, England. Originally, he looked 
for 
inspiration 
the 
tower of 
Magdalen College, Oxford, but ul!J--
timately decided that its construction was 
"too heavy," and that a lighter structure, 
similar to that of St. Botolph's, would 
be more aesthetically pleasing. 

Paul Goldberger '72, one of the 
authors 
of 
Yale 
in 
New 
Haven: 
Architecture and Urbanism, explains how 
"in this one project, Rogers established 
a kind of soft, highly picturesque 
Gothic as Yale's primary architectural 
style; he gave the University a physical 
symbol. .. that has never been supplant-
ed." The tower was built two hundred 
years after Yale erected its first building; 
Harkness's prominence . established an 
official style to usher the University into 
a new era. 

Although the tower and the other 
buildings which comprise Memorial 
Quadrangle 
Branford and Saybrook 
Colleges 
received a great deal of 
praise for creating a central motif for 
the Yale campus, Rogers's buildings 
drew harsh criticism as well. William 
Harlan Hale '31, who commented on the 
designs in a Yale publication generously 
titled The Harkness Hoot, accused Rogers 
of ignoring the emerging influence of 
Modernism and falling back on anachro-
nistic, derivative architecture instead. 

"It seems almost incredible," he 
wrote. "When the world is witnessing a 
~weeping rebirth of genuine architec-
ture, and when every clear-headed 
designer who is not bound to copies and 
formulas is envisioning a new order of 
forms and masses and relationships, 
then the builders of Yale join the tribe 
of potencial irriitators who grind out 
their lifeless plagiarisms." 

Whether or not the style was indeed 
plagiarized, Yale officials admired the 
University's Gothic appearance so much 
th~t they commissioned Rogers to 
design more buildings in the same 
mimetic 
style. 
These 
buildings-
Jonathan Edwards College and Sterling 
Memorial~ Library 
were built in con-
formity'路With the style of the "Gothic 
corridor:" Rogers continued this tradi-
tion :.'when 'he constructed Davenport 
College in 1933. While the interior of 
Daveppdrt is deCidedly Georgian in 
style, the College's exterior -fa a~e on 
York Street bears Gothic ar hitecture. 

This was not the first time .,that 
Rogers had engaged in this type of 
architectural makeover: Two years --earli-
er he had changed the front of the 
University Theater to reflect a Gothic 
look. Goldberger says that Roger's 
unusual stylistic decision "was motivated 
by an awareness that buildings do 
not stand alone as islands in the city, 
that they must establish urbanistic rela-
tionships among themselves, and that 
their civic responsibility, so to speak, is 
to the streetscape." 

Rogers faced two challenges while 
working at Yale. In addition to present-
ing a uniform architectural style, he 
f~ced pressure to make the buildings 
appear rimch older than they actually 
were. 路 In his opinion, however, Yale's 
attempt to associate newly-constructed 
buildings with an earlier time period felt 
artificial.路 After he decided to apply tile 
inst~_ad of "historically au~ntic" slate 
to the roofs of the Quadrangle build-
ings,' Rogers wrote a letter to Anson 
Phelps Stokes, a former secretary of 
Yale which read: '~s far as traditions go, 
I hope that the only traditions governing 
us will be Yale traditions and our coun-
try's tradition... It does 路seem awfully 
hollow and servilely cringing to use a 
tradition that means nothing to us."

Machu Picchu exhibit, "Unveiling the 
Mystery of the Incas," you must sit 
through a ten-minute video in a dark 
room on stiff, backless, wooden bench-
es. Here, you learn that the city of 
Machu Picchu was built in the 1460s, 
thrived until the 1532 Spanish conquest 
of Peru, and was later reduced to ruins 
as it "faded from memory" 
that is, 
until Yale Professor Hiram Bingham 
III's "scientific discovery" of the site in 
1911. The video poses questions such 
as, "How was such a great archaeologi-
cal structure revealed after 350 years?" 
The narrator invites you to "let your 
journey of discovery begin." The large 
screen then rises to reveal a heavy door, 
which takes the cue to slowly open on a 
reproduction of a portion of the 
ancient city 
mimicking the feeling of 
"discovery" Bingham must have felt one 
hundred years ago . 

I imagine that his discover was a little 
more arduous. He wrote in his diaries 
about the magnificent payoff: the "great 
snow peaks looming above the clouds 
more than two miles overhead" and "the 
foaming, glistening, roaring rapids," that 
left him awestruck. I, however, am not 
immediately taken aback by my first visit
