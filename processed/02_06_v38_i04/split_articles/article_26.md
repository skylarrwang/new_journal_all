reproduced the sentiments on 
campus, tempering surprise with 
reflection. But alumnae discussed 
these issues based on decisions 
they already made. 


Instead of 
turning to current students to 
gauge the cultural meaning of 
motherhood in an Ivy Lea·gue set-
ting as Story had, I turned to 
women among Yale;s alumni who 
had already made the choices that 
female 
students 
inter-
viewed 
in 
the 
article 
could only imagine. 


t took me a while to 
realize 
that 
e 
to picture myself transcending the 
limitations of her mold. 


In a November 2001 article· for 
Yale 
Alumni 
Magazine, 
Cara 
Worthington Fe kula Hyson '77 
questioned whether a liberal arts 
curriculum should be responsible 
for giving" women a crash-course in 
life: "Who was going to prepare 
them for what was ahead? Did they 
know it wasn't a clear shot to the 
zrs 
Larned Professor of History, has 
interacted with generati ns of Yale 
women sirice 1967. She told me Yale 
did have· a gendered stereotype. He 
just didn't have ovaries. 


"Once upon a time," . Russett 
recalled, "certainly the Yale Man 
connoted someone who had much 
more of a fashion sense, wh.o was 
·elegant rather than scholarly look-
ing, a fellow who might wear a 
camel-hair 
coat, 
who

looked as if he might 
enjoy sports, and certain-
ly not the kind of person 
to sit in a library." Even 
if it is a stereotype, and a 
phony one at that, she 
thinks the Yale Man is an 
identifiable persona with 
particular mystique . 


Russett's image of the 
Yale man can be updated 
to 
loosely 
apply 
my male peers, who I 
do · not 
think 
would 
object too gravely to its

of us proo~bly haven't-· -
but we have all envisaged 
glimmers of our future, if 
only 
Barbie-doll 
dreams of white-decked wedding 
days. It is easy, however, to imag-
ine ourselves in the contexts we're 
accustomed to, reproducing the 
choices our parents made to get us 
here. 


Unlike me, some girls I 
spoke to said they could not fath-
om not being working moms; their 
moms (and Barbies) had worked 
every day of their lives. 


In the 
article's aftermath, I tried to assess 
how I would have answered Story's 
survey. As vivid, forthcoming, and 
certain as my professional aspira-
tions are, I would have answered in 
the only way I can envision. 


Finding other molds, I 
knew, 
require 
finding 
other 
women to look to as models-
.· women related to me not by blood, 
but by the shared experience of 
four years at Yale. My mom is my 
best friend and biggest role model, 
but I feel trapped by my inability

top? Did they realize that life is full 
of heartaches? Did they have any 
idea of what would bring the great-
est joys? Did they realize how many 
personal decisions and compromis-
es would influence that career they 
were preparing for? Were they pre-
pared to face the personal .and pro-
fessional challenges?" 


With thirty years between 
us, Hyson and 
I 
ques-
tion whether 
Yale has a responsibil-
ity to create a particular and 
practical model for female 
graduates like myself, for 
whom professionalism is not 
innate. Cynthia Russett, the 
connotations. 


But even Russett, a scholar with a 
learned intuition of the situation of 
women past and present, could not 
conjure a comparable vision of the 
Yale Woman, the paradigm I was still 
searching for. 


When Yale's first women matric-
ulated in 1969, they weren't con-
cerned with the idea of creating a

Yale Woman 
they were concerned 
with making a mark at all. "When 
the women first came, they felt they 
had to prove themselves, and if 
they were being admitted, they well 
remembered 
Kingman 
Brewster had talked about graduat-
ing a certain number of leaders per 
year, and so some alumni feared 
that the leadership numbers might 
fall if women were admitted," said 
Russett. "Because they weren't like-
ly to be the leaders, they had this 
sense of much to prove." 


The 
simultaneity of coeducation and 
feminism was an electric combina-
tion at Yale, imbuing some female 
students with a greater sense of 
obligation. "Gloria Steinem came 
here to · speak and l heard that she 
was criticized by some people 
because she was wearing lipstick ... 
you didn't· care about your appear-
ance, you had points to make, and 
things to do." 


I wear .lipstick (and mascara, and 
blush), but I definitely have points 
make 
and 
things 
do. 


Contacting women from past eras at 
Yale he,lped me understand how my 
own experience, reproduced and 
contrasted with the experiences of 
others. 


I began using the Yale 
Alumni dires;tory as my own per-
sonal rolode:X:: 
"Hi Ms. McGinnis, 
I would· like to talk to you about 
your experience at Yale in the ear!J 80s 
and how it impacted the choices you · 
made and the places you are going in 
your life. Perhaps you also have opin-
ions · about these recent NYT af!'lic/es 
as well. 
Essential!J, I am trying to 
trace the evolution (or not) of the Yale 
Woman ... 


Hen Gibson McGinnis was a 
success story that I was 
relieved to 
en~ounter. 
A 
graduate of the class of 1982, she is 
a partner in the law firm Haynes and 
Boone, 
LLP, 
from 
her 
Baltimore home telecommutes to its 
DC office four days a week. 


She 
had her first child at 3 7; then she 
had a second. 
Her husband, a 
physician, is also a Yale graduate. 
He does the cooking . 


"We all think we can control 
everything. We're Yalies right?!" she 
intoned sarcastically. 


"If we think ... students at Yale 
are n1isguided at the very least, 
then I think we owe it to them to 
talk ... We had an [AYA] women's 
conference two years ago where 
there was so much 
three hundred 
Yale alumnae 
energy. 
I think 
your . generation 
is 
teachable. 
College students are teachable. We

can serve as a resource." 


Ellen 
makes traditional roles seem less 
obvious by having it all. But more 
importantly, she is the embodi-
ment of what I have been unable 
to imagine after so many years. · It 
was not ignorance, but the inac-
cessibility of a variety of real-
world role models that made me 
so reluctant to imagine a life suc-
cessfully combining motherhood 
and professionalism. 


The alumnae with whom I 
interacted were lively, engaged, 
and enthusiastic about discussing 
an issue that everyone has some-
thing to say about. They talked at 
length about chapters, choices, and 
complications. 


My inbox, and

more im.p.ortantly my brain, was 
clogged --with their responses. A

.j?~t _::!here are plenty 
of Yale alumnae who ·could serve 
as models to establish this para-
digm. 


I'm not ready yet to give up 
playing house in exchange for 
actually having one of my own, 
but when I do, it may be just like I 
always imagined it. What all of the 
alumnae overwhelmingly expressed 
was that there is nothing "unsuc-
cessful" about being a homemaker, 
or as I'd prefer, "home engineer." 


Ultimately, the Yale Woman 
finds fulfillment by forging her 
own path. I'm content with not 
knowing what lies ahead. It would 
ruin the fun. Maybe I'll be like my 
Barbie, or maybe I won't. Either 
way, I plan to utilize my education 
and my experiences to delineate 
my own boundaries, rather than 
subscribing to a plastic ideal.
