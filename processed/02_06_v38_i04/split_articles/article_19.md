EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
In December 2004, Teri Stone-Godena and three other 
midwives gathered in a Â·New Haven home to do what- . 
they do best: deliver a baby. The set-up was markedly 
different from the cramped hospital room most people 
believe to be the most suitable place for a woman to give 
birth. Instead of disconnected P.A. announcements, the 
only background noise was the low murmur of the midwives' voices. Instead 
of neutral beige walls and tackily upholstered chairs, the mother-to-be, 
Arianna Stein, was surrounded by the familiar comforts of her own kitchen . 
And, instead of lying on a sterile, mechanical bed, she relaxed in the warm 
water of a birthing pool. 
The woman and her husband, Josh, remained in the pool for her entire 
12-hour labor. "She gave birth to Gracie in the tub," Stone-Godena said. 
"And then she pulled Gracie up 
Gracie didn't remain floating underwater-
she pulled Gracie up to her chest and we wrapped them all in a nice warm 
towel that we'd heated in the microwave."
