ONCE UPON A TIME 
WELL, IN 1HE 1960&-

Mike and Ellie Ianuzzi had a dream . 

Determined young New Haveners amidst a 
swarm of studious, stoned Yale students and 
scholarly, stoned Yale professors, they fun-
neled their passion into their very own 
lovechild: a photocopy shop. Groovy. 

Birthed in a tiny space on Broadway, 
TYCO survived adolescence a couple of 
stores down and is now enjoying a ripe mid-
dle-age at its current address on Elm. Despite 
the buzz about a rapidly approaching "paper-
less society" 
a concept which fizzled in 
proper Y2K fashion 
TYCO has grown, 
acquiring a new baby sister along the way: 
Elm City Fine Stationers, on Chapel Street, 
was hatched to compliment TYCO's everyday 
services. The two stores, still lovingly attended 
to by Mike and Ellie, are prospering. 

One of the forces 
TYCO's success 
is its long-term staff. As Mike Ianuzzi 
describes it, an employee "either fits or does-
n't fit. You can tell early on." Course packet 
season, the most hectic time of year, weeds 
out misfits. ''This is the time when everyone 
here really peaks and steps up to the plate-
it's a high-pressure environment. It helps that 
Ellie and I are in the trenches with them and 
really believe the employee situation is a two-
way street," Ianuzzi reflects from his desk on 
the cluttered third floor of the TYCO war-
zone. "'Ihjs is a big part of why I think our 
customer relations are second to none." 

Jodie Foster '85 might agree. "She was one 
of the absolute nicest people ever to walk 
through our door," Ianuzzi attests. One of the 
perks of catering to a Yale crowd is interact-
ing with future bigwigs, be they students at 
the drama school or ambitious EP&E 
majors. ''I'm sure Bill Clinton came into 
TYCO sometime during his time at Yale," 
Ianuzzi muses. ''We might not have known 
it then, but we probably copied some papers 
for him." 

Since the rapport built with students oper-
ates on four-year cycles, TYCO relies primari-
ly on its devoted professor clientele. Each 
professor selects a store to print their course 
packets according to the service, value, and,--
at least for Dean Jennifer Wood of Ezra 
Stiles 
the dog biscuits. ''I use TYCO for my 
course packets because I love the people (one 
woman gives treats to my dog) and they're 
very fast," Wood comments. ''I'm very loyal
