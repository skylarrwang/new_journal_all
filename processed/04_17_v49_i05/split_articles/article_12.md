THE BASEMENT CURATOR

A step into Yale’s underground art scene
Felicia Chang
Benji Fleischacker, a senior at Yale, draws his bow 
across the cello’s strings and begins to play the opening 
note of Bach’s Cello Suite No. 1 in G Major. Under dim, 
red-tinted light, a crowd of students gathers around him. 
Some watch him with their mouths agape, but junior 
Brian Orozco stands with his eyes closed and head bowed, 
as if in prayer. Fleischacker stops mid-song and softly taps 
Orozco with his bow: he needs Orozco to turn to the next 
page of sheet music. It takes Orozco a few seconds to real-
ize, open his eyes, and fumble to the right section.


The crowd is gathered at “The Holy Holy Chapel,” 
a week-long art show curated by Orozco featuring the 
works of fifteen Yale undergraduates. The “Chapel” is the 
basement of Orozco’s house on Edgewood Avenue. An 
intertwining network of air ducts wrapped in silver insu-
lation hangs from the low ceiling. The walls are white-
washed, jagged bricks showing through in spots where 
paint has flaked off. Every available space is covered with 
artwork: a mix of silkscreened curtains, photos, paintings, 
and sculptures.


While planning his show, Orozco was aware of the 
“barriers to entry” inherent to an off-campus exhibition. 
However, having the art show in his building, he said, 
gave him the freedom to do whatever he wanted with the 
space and curate the show from scratch. But he knew that 
the idea of visiting a stranger’s dingy basement off-cam-
pus could dissuade some people from showing up. “I 
don’t trust Yalies to come more than two blocks,” Oroz-
co’s roommate, Ryan Mera Evans, joked a few days before 
the opening.


Yet around seven on a Friday night in late March, the 
Chapel begins to fill with people. Orozco, dressed in a 
lilac button-down draped over a black shirt, waits by the 
stairs and greets each newcomer enthusiastically. Most 
visitors gather into small groups that squeeze together for 
lack of space, chatting and sipping on Franzia or fruit 
punch from plastic cups as the sound of the cello floats 
in the background. Some slowly weave through the room, 
spending a brief moment in front of each piece of art-
work. Others linger at just one piece, staring intently.

Although Orozco came to Yale with the intention of 
majoring in Art, he felt that the academic demands of 
college drew him away from making genuine work and 
exploring issues of race and heritage. “I find myself in 
art classes doing assignments just for the sake of doing 
them, just for the sake of getting a grade,” he said. “I can’t 
spend four years doing that.” The limitations of the aca-
demic environment precipitated his decision to switch 
out of the major. His show—liberated from Yale spaces—
reflects his new sense of freedom.


Orozco spent the afternoon before the show arrang-
ing and rearranging the artwork, searching for a certain 
“visceral reaction” that would come only from a precise 
presentation of the pieces. He began by creating trian-
gular bowling pin–like formations of small plaster apples 
in opposite corners of the basement, as requested by the 
artist, junior Annie Jones. He used the only two photo-
graphs in the show as central works, arranging the other 
pieces around them. One, by junior Michelle Kemei, is a 
side profile of a black man’s face, his pink flower earring 
in vivid focus. The other, by senior Anna Wane, captures 
a foot dangling over the side of a bed. “I knew for a fact 
that I wanted a lot of the energy to revolve around [the 
photographs],” Orozco said. “I moved the image to one 
place and everything else followed like Tetris.” 


After hanging up every piece, Orozco realized that all 
the artwork “to some extent explicitly dealt with race and 
bodies of people of color.” The two photographs both fea-
ture black bodies. A large painting depicts a black woman 
in repose, lips parted, surrounded by a sea of color as a 
metallic hand reaches towards her. Other pieces address 
issues of race and identity in more indirect ways. For 
Orozco, even the performance of Suite No. 1 in G served 
as a meditation on “what white music looks like and what 
kind of European tradition has been ingrained in my 
upbringing.”


Though none of his own pieces were in the show, the 
show’s racial focus reflects Orozco’s own recent artistic 
path. His latest works have largely involved an explora-
tion of his Mexican heritage: last semester, he created a 
photo-book that explored both his and his parents’ iden-
tity through scenes captured on his first visit to Mexico 
during spring break last year. “Through self- discovery 
and courses I took at Yale, I realized that I should look 
back to my own history and identity,” he said.


While Orozco sees race as the predominant theme of 
the show, senior He Li, whose paintings were on display, 
views the “The Holy Holy Chapel” in a more spiritual 
way. One of his paintings depicts two men walking along 
the sidewalk against a backdrop of clouds illuminated 
by bright moonlight. “Not only can [art] function as the 
same way as religion, but it can also lead people to spirit, 
to God,” he said. “The beauty of creation, the beauty of 
the world can lead us to what is out of the world, what is 
beyond the material.” 


“The Holy Holy Chapel” offered its viewers a spiritual 
enclave and an opportunity to confront issues of race and 
identity. But Orozco said he had a more modest aim, 
too: in one, transient moment, to bring people together 
through art.


As Fleischacker finishes playing, the crowd claps 
and cheers. The audience, once silently focused on the 
music, disbands and reverts to chatter. Orozco ducks 
under a curtain in a corner of the basement. Suddenly, 
the opening notes of Bach’s Cello Suite No. 1 in G Major 
fill the basement again, reverberating through speakers. 
The piece plays for the entire night.
