In April of 2015, Jamie Lundell won a ten thousand dollar 
check from the History Channel for forging a Roman gladi-
ator sword. The blade, which took him five days to fashion, 
was the length of a man’s arm and sharp enough to puncture 
bone, welded from 108 layers of steel all compressed within 
a fraction of an inch and patterned like clouds of petrified 
ink. Below the hammered bronze hilt adorned with buffalo 
horn caps, a blood-red inscription burned in the olivewood 
handle: AUDENTES FORTUNA IUVAT. Fortune favors the 
bold. 
Demand for ancient swords has flagged somewhat in recent 
millennia, but to the judges of Forged in Fire, the reality TV 
show tournament Lundell competed in that spring, this did 
not seem particularly relevant. In every episode, four black-
smiths from around the country were summoned to a studio 
in Brooklyn, where their mastery of ironwork was tested in 
tournament. By his third round, Lundell had already proven 
himself by transforming a two-inch ball bearing into an arced 
fighting knife whose superior construction outclassed the 
work of two other contestants. For the final round, he and his 
rival returned to their home forges to produce the most faith-
ful replica of an ancient sword they could muster. Both were 
pieces of art, but they had to cut, too. What mattered to the 
judges now was the sharpness of the edge and the construc-
tion of the handle, the temper of the steel and the trueness of 
the blade, all of which they tested on human-sized dummies 
with faux organs inside. When the credits rolled, Lundell 
walked away as the champion.
“It definitely helped me pay off my loans,” he tells me in 
earnest. More than a year has passed since the episode aired, 
and we are standing between two anvils in Dragon’s Breath 
Forge, the workshop in Wolcott, Connecticut, where Lundell 
wrought his winning blade. He has worked here for the past 
fourteen years. The building is the size and shape of a large 
greenhouse, but instead of shrubs the floor is crowded with 
vises and sledges and menacing power saws. It resembles the 
ideal filming location for an industrial-themed horror movie, 
the precise type of place where one would not want to find 
oneself lost in the middle of the night or held captive by a 
vengeful clown. 
Fortunately, however, it is eleven in the morning, and I 
am in the presence of a master. He is currently inspecting a 
brick-sized piece of metal, called a billet, which he tells me 
will form the blade of a new sword by week’s end. I ask him 
how the billet is constructed.
“Oh—these are just five sheets of ten-ninety-five and fif-
teen-twenty.”
I wait for him to elaborate, but after a moment of silence I 
strike myself as embarrassingly dull and offer a few vigorous 
head nods. He seems satisfied by this response.
   Lundell, who turned thirty-six this year, looks like a char-
acter from Game of Thrones but has the demeanor of one 
of its fans. He sports a haphazard boxed beard and a brown 
ponytail that hangs down the back of a flannel jacket. When 
he speaks, he sounds less like a blacksmith than a computer 
engineer from Minnesota: kind-voiced and unaffected, frugal 
with his words, and sort of confused as 
to why I don’t understand the particu-
lars of his profession. 
Dragon’s Breath Forge advertises 
itself as a producer of exotic weap-
onry: battle axes, Viking spears, Ara-
bian split-tipped swords—even Hobbit 
knives. The market for such items is
