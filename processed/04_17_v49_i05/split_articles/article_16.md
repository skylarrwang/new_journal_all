The Celotto Center was the reason Maria, who asked to be 
identified by her first name only, also decided against Polly 
McCabe. Like St. Louis, Maria stayed at Hillhouse after 
becoming pregnant in 2014.
 “I didn’t want to get separated from high school at all. I 
got along with the teachers and staff at Hillhouse, and I didn’t 
really know anybody at Polly McCabe in order to make new 
relationships with them,” said Maria, who is now a sopho-
more in college. “I felt like everybody as a community came 
together, and they have options and different resources for the 
different types of people that attend school…Polly McCabe, 
it seemed like a good school, it just didn’t seem like the right 
decision for me.”

The numbers suggest that most pregnant teens in New 
Haven felt like Maria and St. Louis. But some still chose 
Polly McCabe. 
I was unable to get in touch—directly or through admin-
istrators—with the handful of students who were still at Polly 
McCabe when it closed. According to Bradford, several were 
too busy or did not want to draw attention to themselves. 
“I think that having a school dedicated to pregnant and 
parenting teens was better because the girls were more 
focused,” said Dorothy Mazon, the SPPT program’s regis-
tered nurse, who worked at Polly McCabe until it closed. “It 
was a like group of people. In a regular school there is still 
a lot of name-calling. There’s discrimination, harassment. 
Even some of the teachers don’t want to be ‘bothered’ with 
a pregnant individual. They act like they don’t know what to 
do.”
“I have known students to attend McCabe and testify that 
without McCabe, they could not have made it,” Carberry, the 
school’s principal, said.
Both St. Louis and Maria said they sometimes felt stigma-
tized by their peers at Hillhouse. St. Louis said classmates 
stared at her belly when it grew. Maria recalled hearing some 
snide comments. But both women said they did not allow the 
scrutiny to deter them.
 “I didn’t pay attention to them,” Maria said. “It was a mat-
ter of, I’m going to school to learn and not to listen to every-
body else and what they have to say.”

pect of doing more with less. When asked if the district would 
continue providing parenting classes and counseling if the 
grant money were to stop, Johnson turned his palms skyward.
“That’s when I go like this,” he said, shrugging. “It wouldn’t 
be up to me. I really don’t know.”
St. Louis and Maria are testaments to the fact that pregnant 
students can flourish inside traditional schools. And Bradford 
and Mazon acknowledge that Polly McCabe’s closing has 
brought some unexpected benefits. School attendance, a fre-
quent problem at Polly McCabe, is now slightly up among 
pregnant students. 
“They’re around their friends, they have access to different 
activities that they didn’t have there,” Bradford explained.
“Polly was not the panacea,” Mazon said.
But pregnant students can succeed only with support, 
whether it comes from a standalone school or a support pro-
gram.
St. Louis said she can’t imagine what her pregnancy would 
have been like without resources like SPPT. Sitting in the 
program’s office, as she chatted with Bradford about her son’s 
upcoming baptism, she described the help the program had 
given her. 
“They helped me with the colic, and making sure he 
doesn’t sleep on his back,” she recalled. “A lot of things I did 
not know.”
There was a time when she didn’t think she would have 
that support. When she found out she was pregnant, she said, 
she had no intention of going to anyone at Hillhouse for help. 
“I was petrified,” she said. “I was like, I don’t know them. 
Why would I go there?” 
It was a friend who had been through the program who 
finally convinced her. St. Louis remembered thinking, 
“Maybe I should try it out.”
That was the choice that shaped the rest of her preg-
nancy. And of all the choices now potentially limited by Polly 
McCabe’s closing—the choice to stay in school, the choice 
of what kind of school to attend—that is the one that mat-
ters most, and perhaps the one that is most endangered: the 
choice to ask for help, knowing that it can be found.
The importance of Maria’s choice to pursue and prioritize 
her education, in spite of her pregnancy, is a point every-
body agrees on regardless of their views on Polly McCabe as a 
standalone school. But that choice, like the choice to attend 
Polly McCabe, is also under threat from funding shortages.
The shortfall is twofold: The school district did not gain 
any money from closing Polly McCabe’s educational ser-
vices, and the support services, now under the umbrella of 
the state-sponsored SPPT program, are losing funding too.
On the educational side, the district is technically saving 
over $100,000 a year from the closure, both on the costs of 
running the Polly McCabe building and on the expense of 
teacher salaries—the latter of which was already reduced 
because for the school’s last year, the district had hired only 
part-time retired teachers, Carberry said. But given the dis-
trict’s multimillion-dollar deficit, the money saved cannot be 
redirected to other resources. Money saved in a deficit, John-
son pointed out, “doesn’t really exist.”
On the support side, the grant money for SPPT, which 
has always come from the state rather than the district, is still 
active––for now. But another grant the program relied on, 
the Young Parents Program Grant, ended recently. Bradford’s 
staff has been reduced from six to four, and each member 
feels the strain.
“We just need more staff,” Bradford said. “We’re being 
asked to do more with less.”
And if the state or federal government decides to decrease 
educational funding or stop providing money for pregnant 
and parenting teens altogether, Bradford will face the pros-
