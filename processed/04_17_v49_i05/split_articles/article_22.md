pher and director. But the terror on her face looks and feels 
real.

Women Beware Women started rehearsing in September 
2015, on the same afternoon the School of Drama addressed 
the results of the AAU Survey. “The atmosphere in the room 
was tense,” says Leora Morris, the director. The cast grap-
pled with the thought of embarking on this produc-tion—
in which two actors are nude for an entire scene and one 
woman is raped—as they confronted the magnitude of Yale’s 
real sexual assault problem.

“The AAU report boggled the mind,” says Channick. As 
the Title IX Coordinator for the School of Drama, she fields 
complaints from victims of sexual misconduct who choose 
to use Yale resources to resolve them. Considering the 
infrequency of those visits, she says reading the report was 
“shocking”—she hadn’t realized the extent of the issues at 
the School of Drama.

Part of the reason the AAU results were alarming, accord-
ing to Dean of the School of Drama James Bundy, was the 
magnitude of the harassment statistics and the responses 
from students who didn’t report these incidents. “It was clear 
that there were perpetrators who did not know they were per-
petrators,” he says, “and victims who did not feel equipped to 
deal with the issues.”

The AAU report didn’t break down statistics by profes-
sional school. But when the results were published, the Title 
IX office was able to share the exact numbers with Chan-
nick, which she re-ported to the School of Drama. She and 
the University Title IX committee declined to share those 
numbers with me. “In terms of prevalence, the graduate 
and professional schools had similar results,” says Stepha-
nie Spangler, University Title IX Coordinator. The types of 
sexual har-assment reported for all the graduate and profes-
sional schools were primarily “insulting sexual remarks” and 
“inappropriate personal comments.” More than 80 percent 
of sexual harassment cases occurred between students. And 
while the graduate school rate of sexual assault was lower 
than the undergraduate rate, the data still caused alarm: 
according to the AAU report, 13.3 per-cent of women in 
Yale’s graduate schools had been sexually assaulted, 3.9 per-
cent of men, and 17.7 percent of students of other genders.

Students were shaken. Many pointed to the glaring lack 
of consent education as the reason these instances were slip-
ping through the cracks. “The first year I came in there was 
about 15 minutes of SHARE [Yale’s Sexual Harassment and 
Assault Response & Education Center] getting up onstage 
and saying, basically, here’s where you go when you get 
raped,” says Sarah Mantell, a third-year playwriting student 
at the School of Drama and a member of the Graduate & 
Profes-sional Student Title IX Advisory Board. “[It was] like 
getting raped was an inevitability that the school had noth-
ing to do with.” 

Her second year, she says, the orientation was expanded 
to almost an hour, and they threw in booklets on bystander 
intervention. But still, says Mantell, “it was pathetically lit-
tle.” So this summer, Channick worked with students and 
faculty alongside the head of the Office of Gender and 
Campus Culture, Melanie Boyd, and the Title IX office to 
develop a new set of workshops and draft the protocols. With 
these guidelines, they sought to preemptively address the 
problem.

“I don’t in my heart of hearts believe that most of what 
people are perceiving as harassment and assault is happen-
ing inside the classroom and inside the rehearsal hall,” said 
Dean Bundy. “But based on the magnitude of the num-
bers…” he trailed off. “We felt that it was possible for an 
im-provisational moment to become an assault unless peo-
ple know what the ground rules were.” 


In the final scenes of the 1972 film Last Tango in Paris, 
actress Maria Schneider is pinned down by her on-screen 
love interest, Marlon Brando, and raped with a stick of 
butter. Her whimpers echo as Brando thrusts. It’s a violent 
depiction of sex that critic Roger Ebert called “shockingly 
daring” and “sudden, brutal, and lonely.” In December 
2016, an interview with director Bernardo Bertolucci sur-
faced in which he admitted that he and Brando planned the 
scene the morning it was shot. Schneider, ambushed in front 
of the camera, had had no idea what was coming.

Bertolucci feels guilty now, but he doesn’t regret the deci-
sion. “I didn’t tell her because I wanted her reaction as a girl, 
not as an actress,” he explained in the interview on College 
Tour, an entertainment TV show. “I didn’t want Maria to act 
her humiliation, her rage. I wanted Maria to feel.” 

Directors like Bertolucci believe that in order to act truth-
fully, one must endure trauma. In this instance, the notion 
was taken to a dangerous extreme. None of the anecdotes I 
heard from Yale students involved the level of abuse Schnei-
der endured—no scenes of gruesome assault happened 
unexpectedly—but my conversations with female actors, 
especially, revealed an insidious discomfort with everyday 
interactions in the rehearsal room.
