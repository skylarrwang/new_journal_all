cast in [those] roles.” At the undergraduate level, similar 
informal mecha-nisms exist. Before auditioning for Wild 
Party, Doyle and Probst had to sign “nudity clauses” that said 
they were comfortable baring it all, should they get the parts.
Even when given the option to refuse a role, however, it’s 
hard for actors to turn down a good gig. The natural dynamic 
between actor and director (or student and professor) is def-
erence to authority. Directors direct, actors follow. “When 
you’re trying to get the role, you’re pressured to be down for 
anything,” says Doyle. “I think I could have just said no [to 
the nude scene] but felt like I owed it to the team to realize 
this vision.” The director of Wild Party did not respond to a 
request for comment. “I tried to make sure the actors were 
being asked if they were comfortable,” says Morris regarding 
Women Beware Women. “But there’s no way to know whether 
they truly were or if they just wanted the part.” After col-lege, as actors begin to be paid for their work, the dynamic 
evolves yet again: employer, employee. If you won’t do your 
job (naked, or in your underwear, or in a parka), someone 
else will. Says Buzan, “If David O. Russell was like, ‘Come 
be in my film, but there’s a huge sex scene,’ I’d be like, ‘Of 
course.’”

At least once a week, senior Emma Speer squats and con-
torts her body on a white podium in the middle of a class-
room, completely naked. Around her, students sit at atten-
tion, eyes following the curves of her body, pencils tracing 
her outline. For her, discomfort isn’t a factor in this situa-
tion. “I feel like there’s a chunk of my brain missing,” she 
told me. “There are people on this campus who have seen 
the innards of my asshole.” She shrugs. 
If Speer was playing a nude model in a play, if the peo-
ple around her were fellow actors, and if those actors were 
able to touch her, her scenes would fall under Point Six of 
the protocols: “When scenes with partial nudity, nudity, and 
consensual sexual touching are being staged…closing such 
a rehearsal to all but essential personnel…is standard,” it 
reads. “Exceptions should be rare and agreed to by all actors, 
stage manager, and director.”
No such rules exist at the School of Art. Samuel Messer, 
Associate Dean of the School of Art, says that the school 
doesn’t have protocols like the School of Drama does because 
they don’t need them. “It’s a different kind of space—a non-
sexual space,” he explained. It’s not like in an acting class or 
a rehearsal, where the students are physically engaging with 
each other. “You can’t touch the models,” he told me.
Gabby Bucay, a senior art major at Yale who began mod-
eling last January, agrees that the space is “desexualized” 
during the majority of each class. “As someone who has also 
drawn nude models, I know you get 100 percent desensitized 
almost instantly,” she said. “It’s like drawing a box.” But in 
between poses, the professor sometimes pauses the action so 
students can get water or supplies. Bucay said that when the 
pose is finished, leaving the situation less structured, “there’s 
this strange hierarchy.” Speer recalls instances where men 
have complimented her smile, or tried to talk to her even 
while she was posing. She hates it, she said.
Another argument against regulating nude models is that 
they are a self-selecting group. The job pays twenty-five dol-
lars an hour, and students apply under the assumption that 
they’ll be naked in front of a class. This means most Title 
IX violations registered would fall under the employ-ment 
discrimination exception BFOQ—Bona Fide Occupational 
Qualification. “If there’s a casting call and they’re looking for 
a short black woman to play a part, it’s hard to say that’s racist 
or sexist because that’s a BFOQ,” Professor Fischel explains. 
“In the case of having nude models it would be hard to say, 
‘I don’t want to be naked.’” But with something as nebulous 
as sexual discomfort, should actors have to assume its possi-
bility as part of the job description?

Last year at the School of Drama, three plays, including 
Women Beware Women, dealt with graphic sexual abuse. By 
December 2016, two more productions had begun rehears-
ing: Bulgar-ia! and Othello. This spring, it’s ’Tis Pity She’s a 
Whore (whose general content one can infer from the title) 
and Titus Andronicus (“Huge rape scenes, lots of dragging 
onstage,” explains Yionoulis). It’s clear: sex—and sexual vio-
lence—sells. So perhaps the protocols miss tackling a bigger 
question: why are non-consensual sex scenes so pervasive in 
theater and film? Why are bodies—particularly female bod-
ies—constantly made vulnerable for the audience’s benefit?
 “It gets a little bit, frankly, boring,” Professor Fischel says. 
“I don’t mean that in a crude way, but rape is always the 
go-to metaphor. Directors need to be asking themselves, do 
you need to have this scene be assaultive?” Actor Sean Hig-
gins agrees. He worries both about how enacting violence 
affects actors and the potential for graphic scenes to trigger 
audience members. “We shouldn’t shy away from the stories 
or be scared,” he says, “but there’s an inherent responsibility 
that we have to live the weight and truth of what those things 
are so that it’s not dealt with in an inconsiderate way.” This 
responsibility falls on the actors and creative team, whose

vision for depicting graphic scenes can vary.
Speer, for whom nudity is second nature, starred in her 
own one-woman play in the fall. In the very first scene, she 
made the choice to enter fully naked. “I wanted to be com-
pletely vulnerable; to show people I’m just a person,” she 
explains. This was her project, over which she had com-
plete autonomy: laying her body bare felt important, and 
fell within her comfort zone. Sometimes, the playwright 
includes the need for sexual content or nudity in the stage 
directions. But when the stage directions are ambiguous, it’s 
up to the director to decide how far to push the scene. Buzan 
told me that having a smart woman at the helm of Women 
Beware Women—rough as it was—kept it from derailing. 
But boundaries were still pushed. For the nude scene, the 
only written stage direction read: “Leantio dressing,” and 
nothing else. This could have been interpreted several ways: 
maybe he was doing so after sex, and could end the nudity 
after five or ten minutes. Morris, however, says that in order 
to achieve the “bald rawness” of the relationship, she felt 
the nudity had to be complete and extended. As for the rape 
scene in Women Beware Women, which was indicated as an 
“attack” in the script, Morris insists that if anything, it didn’t 
go far enough: “If I staged it again, I would have made it 
harder to watch.”

When his students at Yale read Romeo and Juliet, actor 
Peter Francis James wants them to embrace discomfort. 
James, who is black, suggests that when Tybalt insults Romeo, 
he substitute “villain” for a more modern slur. “When you 
say ‘villain,’ the audience’s spines don’t do anything. When 
you say ‘nigger,’ their spines tighten,” he explains. It’s that 
tightening that James says is the essence of the theater. “The 
nature of what we do is to discuss the uncomfortable, to 
make the hidden seen, to make the repressed voiced.”
James also advised the School of Drama’s cast for their 
2016 production of Othello. When the director mentioned 
the new consent protocols on the first day of rehearsal, James 
was dubious. “I fear that they might be interpreted that you 
should not make anyone uncomfortable in any way,” he says. 
“There’s a distinction between comfort and abuse.” 
Shakespeare’s Othello was the first play to require the pro-
tocols, and it’s filled with slutshaming, verbal slurs, physical 
abuse, sex, and murder. Buzan, who plays Desdemona, is 
assaulted and killed in her bed, in her underwear. “In this 
play, it would be beyond peculiar for Desdemona to say we 
shouldn’t kill her at the end because it’s abuse,” says James, 
laughing. “How would you be able to discuss the condition 
of women without it?” The protocols don’t suggest changing 
scripts, however, and make no mention of veto power over 
physical abuse.
But what if artistry and agency could go hand in hand? 
Before, there may have been unspoken discomfort in the 
rehearsal room; now, there are structures in place for raising 
concerns. “Of course you have to find the balance between 
not making rules that deter from the creative process, but 
you have to be comfortable with one another to make art,” 
says School of Drama student Francesca McKenzie. Fellow 
student Emily Reeder says she feels empowered by the pro-
tocols. “They disrupt the power structure of doing whatever 
the director or professor says,” she explains.
According to Channick, most of the complaints that come 
to her concern individuals outside the school, like profes-
sional actors at the Yale Repertory Theatre. She recalls one 
man saying, “I’m an actor—if the scene calls for me to grab 
you and stick my tongue down your throat, I’m going to do 
it.” When I repeat these words to six actors I interviewed, 
they shudder. Dean Bundy, however, asserts that there has 
been little pushback from professionals at the Yale Repertory 
Theater. No one has declined to sign the contracts they’ve 
sent along with the protocols.
Consent and communication protocols and workshops 
are easier to implement from within an institution like Yale. 
“We don’t spend a lot of time here worrying about cash flow 
or keeping lights on or pay roll,” says Dean Bundy. With 
that cushion, the School of Drama can afford to focus on 
what kind of acting practices they’re sending into the profes-
sional world—an issue that takes consideration. “Thinking 
both about the kinds of communities we create here and the 
kinds of leaders these people go on to become is important,” 
she says. “It’s about the here and now, but it’s also bigger 
than that.” 
Students at the School of Drama only spend part of their 
days in rehearsal and even less on stage. They’re often only 
at Yale for three years. So while the school’s protocol works 
within the con-fines of fantasy scenarios or rehearsal rooms, 
prioritizing mutual respect also applies to social and sexual 
situations outside of the theater world. It reminds us that 
consent can, and should, exist in every part of life, both in 
and out of the spotlight.
