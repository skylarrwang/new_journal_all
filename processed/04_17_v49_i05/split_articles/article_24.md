Fifty-six years ago, a flyer around 
downtown New Haven sought subjects 
for a social psychology study. Volun-
teers found themselves in the basement 
of Linsly-Chittenden Hall, in Professor 
Stanley Milgram’s lab. Milgram, who 
was investigating obedience to authority, 
commanded his subjects to shock some-
one else with increasing voltages of elec-
tricity until they refused. Before they were 
debriefed, volunteers thought they had 
actually caused another human being 
intense pain, and, perhaps, depending on 
how far they went, death. For their hour 
of service, Milgram paid his volunteers 
$4.00, plus an extra $.50 for car fare.
Though it’s now considered “uneth-
ical” for experimenters to make you 
think you murdered someone, university 
researchers still need volunteers to carry 
out their research. And many undergrad-
uates are eager to serve as human guinea 
pigs in exchange for some fast cash. As 
with many things at this school, I first 
heard of paid studies through a panlist. 
Yi-Chia Chen, a graduate student in the 
Psychology Department, was sending me 
emails on behalf of the Perception and 
Cognition Lab before I even attended my 
first class at Yale. So, what is it actually 
like to participate in these studies? And 
why do certain students seek them out so 
fiercely?
Given how neatly the weekly emails are 
formatted, I expected that these experi-
ments would involve complex procedures 
and high-tech equipment. At least elec-
trodes, if not lasers. Instead, I was left in a 
dark room with only a desktop computer 
(not even a Mac) on the third floor of 
SSS, where I participated in two under-
whelming 30-minute studies.
The first study was an almost-fun game: 
all I had to do was move my mouse to 
evade little arrows chasing my cursor. But 
the second was the most monotonous half 
hour of my life. I was presented with pairs 
of swan-like creatures, two-dimensional 
and white but with too many wings. I had 
to pick which I preferred (an easy task 
because I’m great at arbitrarily applying 
human beauty standards to non-human 
entities). Though I had ample time to 
contemplate my tasks, I couldn’t decipher 
the objectives of these exercises until my 
experimenter “debriefed” me—which 
was just an explanation of the hyper-spe-
cific phenomenon they were testing; 
not nearly as exciting as the sleek word 
“debrief” might imply. I guess SSS isn’t 
the CIA, even though I was paid with 
what had once been government grant 
money. The experimenter slipped me a
