**Title: CRAFTING A PUBLIC SQUARE**
**Author: Chris Hays**
**Page number(s): 6**

In an alleyway off Chapel Street, across from the New 
Haven Green, a massive red shape seems to float in mid-
air. From most angles, it looks like a collection of disjointed 
forms painted at random across the walls of the side street 
and a distant, spiraling parking garage. But from one privi-
leged perspective, at the entrance of the alley, the abstract 
streaks coalesce into a single form: a square poised on a ver-
tex, with four circles cut away from its interior.

The shape isn’t just a random apparition, but rather the 
culmination of years of planning. In 2004, after putting 
together a successful light show on the Green, a group of 
friends and art enthusiasts formed Site Projects, a non-profit 
arts organization, to encourage and fund public art across 
New Haven. Square with Four Circles, which the organiza-
tion commissioned in 2010, has become one of their most 
recognizable pieces: a quirky, amusing surprise for those who 
stumble across it. For the Site Projects team, also their work 
also advances a far more profound mission: bridging dispa-
rate New Haven communities through the shared experience 
of urban art. But can public installations, whether made out 
of paint or light, really deliver on that vision?

Every two weeks, Site Projects’s six-person, part-time staff 
meets in an ivy-covered repurposed iron foundry on Whitney 
Avenue to discuss their new projects. With its collaborative 
workspaces and open plan, their office has the atmosphere of 
a tech startup. A rolling whiteboard features a jumble of bud-
geting figures and buzzwords like “community engagement” 
and “outreach.” Books with snappy graphics and vague titles 
like Rainbows line the shelves. In keeping with their entre-
preneurial workspace, the team’s vision—art as a unifying 
force of society—matches the grandiosity of a startup’s mis-
sion statement.

“That’s my story. Getting people together,” says Laura 
Clarke, Site Projects’ founder and executive director.

Clarke explains that she is motivated by the way public art 
can transform physical spaces, making them more engaging 
or welcoming to passersby. More accessible and place-spe-
cific than artwork in museums or galleries, public art has the 
potential to engage with a broader audience and influence 
the lived experience of an environment.

Felice Varini, the artist behind Square with Four Circles, 
believes public art can augment a viewer’s perception of a 
physical space and the meanings ascribed to it. Flat geomet-
ric forms superimposed on a three-dimensional space can 
startle and captivate people who might not otherwise stop 
to notice the space. For Square with Four Circles, Varini 
says, “I wanted to create a rapport between the high walls 
on either side and the parking garage canvas at the center of 
the frame.” The abstract red fragments on the walls tie the 
surfaces of the alleyway together, creating a gathering place 
and cultural landmark where previously there existed only a 
drab passageway.

Site Projects has commissioned murals, light shows, and 
a multitude of other installations, from a laser rainbow pro-
jected from the top of East Rock to abstract sea creatures 
made out of balloons for the Peabody Museum of Natural 
History. The group’s permanent installations are almost all 
concentrated downtown, although there are also two murals 
in Westville. Occasionally, the organization hosts events like 
“The Science of Perceiving Color” and “Activism in Art” 
which bring New Haven artists and residents together for 
evening discussions about the aesthetics of public space.

“I think it’s particularly important for democratic societies 
to have these conversations across communities,” William 
Barnett, the president of Site Projects, said, referring to the 
city’s racially and socioeconomically segregated neighbor-
hoods. “The content of the conversation is in some ways less 
important than the fact that the conversation exists.” 
Site Projects’ goal of fostering cross-community conversa-
tions can seem vague, and staff members acknowledge that
