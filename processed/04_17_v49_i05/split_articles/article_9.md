Dear readers:
Earlier this month, nearly one hundred of The New 
Journal’s editors and writers, both past and present, 
gathered at the Yale Club of New York City to celebrate 
the magazine’s fiftieth anniversary. We reminisced 
about our history, spoke about the challenges facing 
journalism today, and discussed how to sustain our 
project for years to come.

We also had the opportunity to remember Edward 
Bennett III ’84, who passed away earlier this year. As 
Andy Court ’83 recounted in his remarks, as a freshman 
Bennett served as the publisher of The New Journal. 
But just before the start of his sophomore year, he 
injured his spinal cord in an accident that would leave 
him in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. After a year 
of rehabilitation, he returned to Yale and spearheaded 
the revival of The New Journal, which had ceased 
publication during his absence. He became the first 
quadriplegic to graduate from Yale, and it is because 
of Bennett’s resilience, tenacity, and love of The New 
Journal that this magazine continues to thrive. To honor 
him and all the work he has done for the magazine, his 
name will appear in perpetuity on our masthead.

We have so many people to thank for our anni-
versary celebration: Dan Yergin ’68, Howard New-
man ’69, and David Slifka ’01 for their generous 
financial support; Andy Court ‘83 and Anson Beard 
’58 for coordinating the Edward Bennett III Memo-
rial Fund, which will be used to support future New 
Journal investigative reporting projects; our board 
of directors, who have been ever generous with 
their time and support; and finally, Elena Saave-
dra-Buckley, Isabelle Taft, and Spencer Bokat-Lin-
dell, for dreaming up the reunion and turning it into 
a reality.

This anniversary has given us opportunity to con-
sider how much can change in half a century and 
yet how much can stay the same. Today, we are as 
committed as ever to doing meaningful journalism 
about Yale and New Haven. As we welcome a new 
editorial staff with this issue, we’re looking forward 
to the next fifty years of The New Journal.

Sincerely,
Eliza Fawcett & Natalie Yang
