EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
This past December, Mubarakah Ibrahim had a craving. 
It was sudden, as cravings tend to be, but this one nagged 
at her for months: she desperately wanted a bean pie. But 
there was a problem: bean pies—a black Muslim specialty 
made from navy beans, the favorite food of Nation of Islam 
leader Elijah Muhammad—are not available in New 
Haven. Ibrahim, a Black, Orthodox Sunni business owner 
in the city, lived two hours away from New York City and 
the nearest bean pies. She was tempted to make the trek, 
but knew there had to be a better way. “I can bake,” Ibra-
him thought to herself. “I can figure this out.” 

Ibrahim got to work. Nine different recipes and count-
less family taste-tests led to a product and a custom label: 
a cartoon version of herself, wearing a pastel pink hijab 
and a magenta apron, smiling and holding a bean pie in 
each hand, with the business’ name, “MmmPies,” hang-
ing overhead. Leveraging a wide network of personal con-
nections (including a few state representatives) accrued 
from almost two decades of living and working in New 
Haven, she quickly obtained all the necessary food vend-
ing licenses.

This is how it tends to go with Ibrahim. Within weeks, 
whims become sustainable business ventures. MmmPies 
is just the latest notch in Ibrahim’s professional belt, one 
that has made her something of a New Haven celebrity. 
She is at once a serial entrepreneur, a community leader, 
a fitness expert who opened Balance Fitness, New Haven’s 
first all women’s fitness studio, a radio show host, a motiva-
tional speaker, a business consultant, an Oprah alum (her 
appearance helped her gain an audience of 276,000 on 
social media), and a mother of four. 

MmmPies, however, represents a departure for Ibra-
him. In some ways, her baking business seems at 
odds with her previous career as a fitness expert, but 
she views MmmPies, like her fitness practice, as part 
of a larger project to help Muslim women and make 
Muslim identities more visible in the New Haven 
community. But with MmmPies, she is trying a new 
tactic. Instead of relying on her charismatic pres-
ence to connect with her customers in person, she is 
making her pies and releasing them into the world, 
where they will land on the tables of people she may 
never meet.

In the back room of Katalina’s, a local bakery on 
Whitney Avenue, I watch as Ibrahim pours Tupper-
ware after Tupperware of slippery navy beans into 
a massive silver mixing bowl. She rents the mid-
sized commercial kitchen every Tuesday to bake 
for MmmPies. The kitchen is modest—a central 
metal table, baking equipment cluttered on a sin-
gle shelf—and her operation is as simple as her rec-
ipe: boxes of frozen pie crusts, containers of beans, 
a crate of eggs, sugar. She is wearing a royal blue, 
floral-patterned hijab with a matching long-sleeved 
shirt, and she only stops chatting when she senses 
that the blender is drowning out her laugh.

Ibrahim grew up in a large family, the fifth of six 
children in a Black Muslim household in Senoia, 
a small town in Georgia. She tells people that her 
birth happened like a country song. “I was born in 
a house that my parents built by hand, at sunset, by 
the lights of a car,” she tells me, anticipating my 
incredulity with her laughter. “Cause it was getting 
dark, and they didn’t have electricity, so somebody 
literally drove their car to the window and shined 
the headlights in the room so my mother could give 
birth to me.”

As Ibrahim pours the beige batter into the empty 
crusts, she narrates her past number by number. Her 
pregnancy weight gain? Eighty-three pounds. Her 
post-pregnancy weight loss? Down from 198 pounds 
in February to 120 pounds by June 27. The date she 
opened Balance Fitness? March 14, 2007. The night 
a producer from Oprah called to have her on the 
show? Thursday, September 13, 2007. The length 
of the segment? Ten minutes, twenty-nine seconds. 
Complementing Ibrahim’s entrepreneurial tenacity 
is a keen awareness of her own brand, including all 
its specific details.

When she gained a substantial amount of weight 
during her first pregnancy due to complications from 
a separated pelvic bone, she was determined to avoid 
the history of diabetes that runs in her family. After 
constructing an intense personal fitness regimen for 
herself, Ibrahim caught the attention of women in 
her mosque for whom exercise had never felt accessi-
ble. She explained to me that a lot of Muslim women 
don’t exercise, “especially Muslim women who are 
more devout.” Within a year, at the age of twenty, 
Ibrahim had clients. Ten years later in 2007, she trans-
formed that informal project into Balance Fitness. By 
the end of that year, she had appeared on Oprah to 
talk about how an Orthodox Sunni woman could be a 
personal trainer. As we spoke in the kitchen, she used 
a line I later realized came directly from her appear-
ance on the show: “No matter where you choose to 
worship,” she said, “every woman wants to know how 
you get rid of cellulite.”

Ten years after that appearance, Ibrahim still sees 
clients, but she has since sold her fitness studio, pour-
ing her energy into MmmPies. Whatever her current 
focus, though, she’s still known around New Haven 
for her entrepreneurial reflex. “I look at her and I 
think, ‘I’m capable, why don’t I do that,’” Celeste 
Valencia, one of Ibrahim’s personal training clients, 
told me. “I don’t know what it is, the entrepreneur 
gene. She’ll come upon challenges and say ‘today I 
learned this, and I didn’t know that before!’”

Back in the Katalina’s kitchen, I help Ibrahim 
unwrap around a hundred frozen pie crusts. (They 
are made locally, since making them herself would be 
financially and logistically impossible.) She fills each 
with batter. The pies are destined for coffee shops 
and supermarkets around Connecticut and Massa-
chusetts—Edge of the Woods, Willoughby’s, Kevin’s 
Seafood—as well as for shipment across the country. 
In recent weeks, Ibrahim has shipped pies as far as 
California and Texas. 

MmmPies is a small company, but there’s already 
evidence that others share Ibrahim’s craving. A 
review on MmmPies’s Facebook page from Yasmeen 
Abdur-Rahman reads: “These bean pies remind me 
of The Nation of Islam and my father! I plan to order 
again, really soon!” But while Ibrahim wants to make 
bean pies accessible to Black Muslims who, like 
her, remember them from their childhoods, she also 
hopes to elevate bean pies to a place in the American 
culinary cultural pantheon. “I want the bean pie to 
have a place at the table next to the pumpkin pie and 
the sweet potato pie,” she says. And she wants to be 
the one to do it.
