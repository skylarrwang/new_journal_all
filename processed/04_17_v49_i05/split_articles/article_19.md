it could splatter in his face like superheated frying oil. He 
begins to jig the sword in the salt, up and down like a length 
of fishing line, as the other blacksmiths look on from afar. 
Swarz-Burt hums Darth Vader’s Imperial March from Star 
Wars while they make ice-fishing puns for the next ten min-
utes. 
“Holy mackerel,” says one blacksmith.
“I don’t like the scale of that joke,” says another. 
When Lundell withdraws the blade from the silo, it shines 
a sun-bright orange. Unlike the blistering air inside the forge, 
the even, liquid heat of the salt doesn’t risk oxidizing the 
blade and relieves it of unwanted stress points. 
Lundell plunges the sword into a metal canister filled 
with room-temperature oil. Flames erupt out of the brim and 
lick the blade, and the shock of the heat exchange causes 
the walls of the canister to vibrate like a tuning fork. I can’t 
tell if the acrid fumes that have just filled the air are coming 
from the crusted salt or the scorched grease, but in any case 
the room smells profoundly of heavy industry. Burnt oil and 
blackened salt stream off the quenched blade in rivulets as 
Lundell blots it with a dirty towel. He looks down the length 
of the blade to ensure it hasn’t developed any warps.
“No woogity!” he says with relief. 
There’s a commonplace kitchen oven in 
the corner of the workshop set perpetually 
to 425 degrees. In a few hours, he’ll place 
the sword in the oven to begin the tem-
pering process, to soften the brittle blade. 
For now, he hangs it up to cool.


When I tell Lundell that I go to Yale, 
he immediately recalls the name of Sam-
uel Yellin. Yellin, Lundell tells me, did much 
of the ironwork for Yale’s residential colleges, 
including the gates below Harkness Tower. He 
was also arguably the country’s most famous 
blacksmith, at a time when the province of met-
alworking had retreated almost entirely to the 
artistic sphere. By the time he died in 1940, 
his ironwork could be found at four other Ivy 
League universities, the Grace Cathedral in 
San Francisco, and the Federal Reserve Bank in 
Manhattan. 

There was a time when some of Yellin’s con-
temporaries called him a genius, but the years 
when people called him anything were few. Those were the 
twilight decades after manufacturing revolutionized the econ-
omy, when the blacksmith still figured more prominently in 
public life. By the sixties, the role of both traditional and 
artisanal blacksmithing had all but vanished in the United 
States. At the time, the historian Alex W. Bealer predicted 
that the blacksmith would soon be an extinct species: “One 
can expect to see the general blacksmith disappear entirely 
before the end of the twentieth century. Probably he will pass 
unnoticed and unmourned by most.” One hundred and fifty 
years ago, there might have been thousands of blacksmiths 
like Lundell in Connecticut, all gainfully employed in local 
shops or factories. Twenty miles away from Dragon’s Breath 
Forge, the Hooker Carriage Company in New Haven, once 
one of the largest coach businesses in the country, used to 
retain 250 smiths on its payroll. It was liquidated shortly after 
World War I, wiped out by the automotive industry. 

I ask Lundell what he thinks about this prospect––if, like 
typewriter repairmen or taxi drivers, he feels personally vic-
timized by modernity. It seems to me, standing here between 
a two-hundred-pound anvil and this century-old power ham-
mer, that it doesn’t much matter what relics he’s able to revive 
from the past. Blacksmithing will never again be what it was.

But if Lundell is as bothered by this fact as I am, he 
shows few signs of having considered it. “It’s certainly not 
as common as it used to be, but I don’t think it’s in any dan-
ger of being lost,” he says. He notes that there is no shortage 
of hobbyists and professionals signing up for classes at the 
Forge, most of whom want to learn how to make swords. And 
besides, the advantage of working with metal is that it rarely 
ever disappears.

“One of the things that really drew me to blacksmithing is 
that I know the things I make are going to well outlast me. 
You go into these museums, and you look at these swords 
that are a thousand years old,” he says. “It’s like a little bit of 
permanence.” 

He knows, for example, that the sword he’s making now 
will be passed down for generations. After he polishes the 
surface to a mirror shine, Lundell will hand the weapon over 
for Jaffrey to keep. The knighting ceremony is coming up 
soon, during an annual SCA tournament called the 100 Min-
utes War.

“You should try to come—although I’d try to dress up if 
you can,” he says. “People tend to get pretty into it.”


November 19, 12:30 PM: The 100 Minutes War is in 
full swing, and things are not looking good. I’m standing at 
the periphery of a nondescript park in Sparta, New Jersey, 
between a Porta Potty and a man fashioning arrows out of 
foam padding and duct tape. I had been unable to salvage 
any of my childhood Lord of the Rings Halloween costumes 
from the recesses of my closet, and I’m starting to feel acutely 
out of place in my street clothes. Hardly more than thirty of 
the 100 Minutes have elapsed, and already one of the King’s 
subjects has been inauspiciously struck on the nape with a 
wooden cudgel, knocking him unconscious. The crowd of 
about 150 people, dressed in all manner of capes, helmets, 
and armor plates, clear the field to make way for an ambu-
lance and a couple of EMTs, who appear surprised to find 
that there’s a war going on. We exchange glances in self-con-
scious solidarity.

I have been trying for the past hour and a half to obtain the 
scheduling details of the knighting ceremony, with very little 
success. A number of people have offered to help me find 
whatever it is that I am looking for—the camera and denim 
are dead post-Enlightenment giveaways—but when I inquire 
about the accolade, they tell me that it’s a surprise and could 
I please refrain from mentioning it. 

Eventually I come upon a clearing at the far side of the 
park, where a small veiled tent has been erected on the grass. 
A man wearing a cerulean tunic and a beaded beard-tie 
informs me that Jaffrey is sitting inside the tent, waiting for 
the court to summon him. He knows by now that he’s being 
considered for knighthood—the announcement was made 
this morning—but he still has no idea about Lundell’s sword, 
which his wife ordered confidentially as a surprise adorn-
ment. The man I am talking to once commissioned Lundell, 
known as Ulfgar the Nice in these parts, to make a battle axe 
for him, so he knows what kind of creation Jaffrey is about to 
receive.

“He’s gonna shit kittens when he sees it,” the man says.

After the sun sets, the few dozen people remaining head 
to a small clubhouse by the side of the road, where a pair of 
fife players with unique senses of pitch announce the court’s 
assembly. At the front of the room, Queen Anna and King 
Brion Tarragon sit perched on their thrones, surrounded by 
a retinue of about twenty nobles. Also in attendance is King 
Edmund of the Middle Kingdom, on visit from the Mid-
realm, a region known elsewhere as the swing states. He sits 
beside the bespectacled Queen Anna, whom he gifted upon 
his arrival with a fifth of Patrón (it’s her favorite). 

After some thirty minutes of procedure, including a 
debriefing of the War casualties, the King and Queen begin 
the ceremonies. The man I talked to earlier has been pro-
moted to an earl; another is made a lord. In both cases, the 
Queen presents scrolls of cardstock embellished with callig-
raphy and gold seals, which before bestowing she displays 
to the audience in a prolonged flourish. Oohs. Ahs. At one 
point, a ringtone version of the mockingjay theme from The 
Hunger Games goes off from someone’s phone in the back 
of the room.

Finally, the court summons Jaffrey from the crowd. He 
kneels before the throne as King Brion produces a pair of 
spurs.

“These are a symbol of rank. But before I put these upon 
you that you may ride in the King’s name,” he says, “is there 
a member of the Order of the Laurels who would have words 
about this gentleman?”

A middle-aged woman standing near the door bounds into 
the aisle. 

“It is my great honor and pleasure to be that voice!” she 
declares. “I am Mistress Aneleda Falconbridge.” 

“Chivalry and art are not so dissimilar,” she says, continu-
ing at a ruminative pace. “For it, like art, must be practiced, 
in order to appear effortless, and in order for it to appear con-
stant. I have watched this man—my friend—practice the art 
of chivalry…and I recommend him to you for this reason.”

Four others come forward to speak for Jaffrey, including 
a duchess and a mistress from the Order of the Pelican. Sir 
Cedric of Armorica, of the Order of Chivalry, is last.

 “All I will say right now is something I’ve said to him many 
times over the years, and it still holds true,” he says. “Dude, 
you don’t suck.”  

Applause breaks out.

“Is there a belt?” asks the King. A subject presents him 
with a belt, which he bestows upon Jaffrey.

“Is there a sword?”

Lundell, standing obscured near the exit in a red poncho, 
steps forward. 

“There is, your honor!” 

The clubhouse erupts into a col-
lective gasp as Lundell offers the 
sword, sheathed in a brown leather 
scabbard. 

“With this sword,” the King says, 
“you carry the strength of our king-
dom. Carry this with honor, and 
use it in justice, and in our name.” 

Jaffrey places the sword by his side, 
and, after being presented with a 
chain, takes his oath.

“I pledge my allegiance, my advice when wanted, my 
sword…and my fealty,” he says, a tear in his eye. “This I swear 
to you, until I die, or this world is destroyed.” 

In a decidedly anticlimactic moment, the King forgoes 
Lundell’s sword—perhaps for fear of scoring Jaffrey’s shoul-
der—opting instead to pick up a prop with blunter edges. 

“And so it is,” King Brion says, “that we dub thee once, we 
dub thee twice, we dub thee knight.”

The room erupts once again in cheers. Jaffrey’s wife is 
blotting her eyes with a Kleenex. The court disbands, and I 
feel a tinge of vicarious indignation for Lundell: the audience 
never got to see his sword. I look for him somewhere in the 
crowd and spot him congratulating Jaffrey, a smile lining his 
face. He seems far from piqued. The sword he wrought will 
not be wielded, but, for now, it does exist. This is all that iron 
in earth can hope for. As the clubhouse clears out and people 
start heading to their cars, I log into Instagram and search for 
Lundell’s name. There are a number of photographs, dated 
from a few days ago, of the work he just relinquished.

the light.
