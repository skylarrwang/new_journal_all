larger than one might think, but it isn’t particularly reliable. 

In 2005, the Forge became a subsidiary of Falling Hammer 
Productions, the decorative ironwork parent company that 
provides the better part of Lundell’s paycheck. The distinc-
tion, however, is largely nominal: in addition to Peter Swarz-
Burt, the Forge’s founder, Lundell is one of only four black-
smiths on staff, and every piece of steel they sell is born in 
the same flames. (Incidentally, three of the four, including 
Lundell, have all won episodes of Forged in Fire.) Lundell 
spends about two days each week working with the other 
smiths on projects commissioned by homeowners typically 
from Greenwich or Manhattan, whose tastes tend to fall short 
of his imagination: balcony railings, Gothic gates and light-
ing fixtures, the occasional praying mantis garden sculpture. 
Today, however, he is working for a different kind of client, 
and this client requires a sword. 


Those who conceive of the United States as a democratic 
republic might be surprised to learn that they also live under 
a system of monarchies. The twenty kingdoms of the Soci-
ety of Creative Anachronism are spread out across five con-
tinents; seventeen of them are located in the United States 
alone. (If you live anywhere along the East Coast from Mary-
land to Quebec, you are a denizen of the Eastern Kingdom, 
where Lundell is a Society member.) The SCA’s unofficial 
motto is “The Middle Ages as They Ought to Have Been”—
which is to say all the fun of archery, blacksmithing, and 
calligraphy without the unseemliness of chamber pots. The 
SCA hosts for its thirty thousand members what some might 
call Renaissance fairs, but to dismiss them as such would be 
to misrepresent the scope of the enterprise and the dedication 
of those involved. Each kingdom is districted into principal-
ities, which are further subdivided into baronies, shires, and 
cantons—all of which are presided over by a king and queen 
who fight to the metaphorical death for their stations.

Lundell got involved in the SCA eight years ago when one 
of his clients, Gelleys Jaffrey—moniker courtesy of the SCA, 
pronounced like “aisles” with a soft ‘g’—informed him of its 
existence. Since then, he’s battled (with wooden swords) in 
a number of combat competitions, but he’s never made it far 
enough in the semiannual Crown Tournament to break into 
the royal family. (He has spent time with the king and queen, 
however; I’m given to understand they are lovely people.) 
In about three weeks, Jaffrey will be knighted, and his 
wife has commissioned 
Lundell to make him a 
realistic Viking sword for 
the ceremony. Lundell 
forges a few weapons a month—orders tend to spike around 
the holidays—but each blade is unique. Before starting work 
on a piece, he draws a scaled diagram of the finished prod-
uct. This week, there’s a piece of graph paper hanging on the 
wall promising a blade with an aqueous pattern similar to 
that of the sword that won him first place in Forged in Fire. 
Instead of using something so prosaic as wood, though, he’ll 
construct the handle from a moose antler recovered from the 
plains of Montana. Depending on the amount of metal and 
labor, a custom weapon from Dragon’s Breath Forge might 
set you back anywhere from five hundred to five thousand 
dollars. This one quotes roughly at two thousand. 

The other smiths are drinking coffee in the office, and the 
only thing that appears to be breathing besides Lundell and 
me is the forge that sits in the middle of the room. As the 
heart of the operation, it stands on a metal table, a hollowed

barrel of concrete about the size of a human torso, inhaling 
a steady flow of propane from a five-foot tank and holding its 
breath at twenty-four hundred degrees Fahrenheit. Behind 
the shimmer of the forge loom two colossal power hammers, 
about seven and twelve feet respectively, apparatuses that 
resemble cartoonishly large sewing machines with the ability 
to draw out scalding blanks of metal. Lundell uses the larger 
of the two power hammers—a hand-me-down from a World 
War I shipyard—to create billets like the one he showed me, 
a metallic sandwich made from five layers of two different 
steels, twisted and cut and reworked several times to form the 
swirled pattern that will reveal itself in the blade.

While the billet is heating in the forge, Lundell drains 
his coffee and offers me a pair of earmuffs. It takes about 
twenty minutes for the steel to reach the ideal working tem-
perature, brightening from charcoal gray to a muted red to a 
glowing orange. At this point, the steel is not quite molten, 
but it’s hot enough to hammer into shape. His arms sheathed 
in elbow-high gloves, Lundell withdraws the billet from the 
forge and places it in the jaw of the seven-foot power ham-
mer. He presses the lever with his foot, and immediately the 
room fills with the deafening sound of metal crashing against 
metal, not bright or tonal like a bell but deep and penetrat-
ing like a jackhammer. As the force of the impact draws out 
the rapidly cooling metal, little cracks of gray oxide begin to 
crust around the billet’s edges. With every blow, the scales 
appear to dislodge not from the surface of the hot steel, but 
from within, flaking off the supple core in ashen crystals like 
snowpack under a ski boot. Sensing a change in the metal 
that I cannot detect, Lundell rushes it back into the fire: if it 
gets too cool, it could develop stress fractures under the ham-
mer, or even snap in two. He continues this cycle—heat and 
hammer, heat and hammer—for about thirty minutes, until 
the billet is more than two feet in length. As Lundell works, 
I mirror his movements, gracefully focusing my faculties on 
staying out of his way.

While the billet is still hot, Lundell uses a band saw to cut 
a “v” at the end of the sword-to-be, forming a serpent’s tongue 
in the metal that he pounds with a hammer to a point. He 
takes the steel to a belt sander to profile the edges; sparks 
shoot out on the concrete floor as the bar becomes a blade. 
Now that it has returned to its normal state of grey, the 
blade looks like little more than a blistered piece of sheet 
metal to me. Lundell walks by with it in hand, and I feel a 
rush of heat blow past my skin.


There are very few people these days who (to borrow a 
somewhat plastic-age phrase) have always known they wanted 
to become blacksmiths. For his part, Lundell didn’t even real-
ize his talent for metalwork until he 
was in college.
“I never thought I was going to 
be a swordsmith,” he says, “because 
I didn’t know that was a thing you 
could be.”

But there had been signs, of course. At an early age, he 
became singularly enchanted with all things medieval. 
Throughout his childhood in Middletown, Connecticut, 
medieval-style Legos, Dungeons and Dragons, and fantasy 
novels held particular appeal for him. “My favorite G.I. Joes 
were always the ones with swords,” he remembers.

In high school, he and his friends started to dabble in 
live-action role-playing games (LARPing, for short), a kind 
of interactive re-imagining of sundry fictions. Inspired by 
the books he read, Lundell worked with his friends to create 
their own LARPing universe with full scripts and plotlines, 
which they acted out while sporting tunics and foam-padded 
weapons they made themselves. It made for exactly the sort of 
training that is necessary for success in the SCA.

After enrolling in Wheaton College, Lundell first planned 
to major in creative writing. Severely dyslexic, however, 
he soon discovered that he much preferred reading fantasy 
books to writing them. He knew from his high school ceramic 
classes that he enjoyed working with his hands, and during 
his sophomore summer he took a course in metalworking 
at the Museum School of Fine Arts. He’s been hooked ever 
since.

It’s the resilience of metal that he loves, he tells me, toss-
ing a piece of bronze in the air and letting it tumble on the 
concrete floor, unmarked. “It’s so much more durable than 
ceramic or glass.”

His first-ever blacksmithing piece was a set of silverware, 
but it wasn’t long before he branched out. When he grad-
uated in 2002, Lundell convinced Swarz-Burt to take him 
on as an apprentice at Dragon’s Breath Forge. Since then, 
he’s become the resident specialist in “historically probable” 
Viking weaponry. 

He’s also started to pursue more approachable projects, 
namely tap handles for a local brewery and a line of jewelry, 
all of which are ripe for featuring on his Instagram page. The 
piece of bronze I pick off the floor is a pendant Lundell cast 
in the shape of Mjölnir, the legendary hammer Thor uses to 
slay a world-eating serpent during the Norse equivalent of the 
apocalypse. It’s available for thirty dollars on the Forge’s Etsy 
page, under “Viking Bling.”


It’s been a couple of days since Lundell profiled Jaffrey’s 
knighting sword, and he’s ready to process it through the final 
heat treatments before he joins it to its handle. He places the 
tang—the svelte end opposite the sword’s tip that he’ll insert 
into the moose antler handle—under a power drill and bores 
two holes in it. Helices of steel spring out of the blade and lit-
ter the floor around the machine like locks of hair in a salon. 
He threads a piece of wire through the tang to make an eye 
hook before we step outside onto the asphalt lawn behind the 
Forge, where the other blacksmiths have been attending to a 
human-sized, propane-fueled silo with a central core of mol-
ten salt. (As it happens, molten salt does not look discernibly 
different from liquid water or simple syrup, though it tends to 
be about fourteen hundred degrees hotter.)

Lundell suspends the sword on a long metal rod and steps 
up onto a tree stump next to the silo. He gingerly lowers the 
sword into the outer chamber to preheat it. If there’s any 
moisture left on the blade when it touches the molten salt,
