EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
I recently participated in a pair of Yale studies, and I 
came away with ten dollars and a broken ceramic 
tumbler. 


The first study I did was a breeze—a mere half-hour 
of clicking a mouse and reading prompts on a com-
puter screen. It left me with a crisp $5 bill after each 
study. That weekend, wanting to invest my hard-earned 
money in the local economy, I went to Junzi’s Night 
Lunch and spent the $10 on a rice bowl and iced tea.


The next week, I stumbled through the 
intimidatingly-clean 
chrome-and-blue 
corridors of the School of Management 
until I found the spartan basement where 
the SOM Lab conducts its studies. The 
activity I participated in had something 
to do with game theory and was compli-
cated enough that I still haven’t received 
full payment—my reward will depend on 
decisions that another participant made; 
I’m either due another $20 on top of the 
$10 they gave me, or I’m shit out of luck. 
The next day, I made the schlep up Whit-
ney Avenue again for a second study. This 
one was basically online shopping, and 
much more up my alley: it involved pick-
ing between differently priced merchan-
dise in each trial. After 30 minutes, I left 
with $13 dollars and a ceramic Yale-brand 
tumbler, one of the merchandise combos 
I had chosen. Unfortunately, it fell off my 
nightstand and shattered before I could 
even write about how excited I was to 
make martinis with it.


Unlike me, some students who engage 
in these paid studies are looking for more 
than bartending accoutrements. Ryan 
Mera Evans, who is taking time off from 
Yale and doesn’t have access to student 
jobs, speaks in devil-may-care socialist 
lingo that reflects his stance: “My ass is 
just broke and unemployed for several 
months now, kind of like scratching by. 
And studies are a mainstay on the circuit 
to establish some sort of financial auton-
omy outside of traditional work.” He has 
taken to strolling around campus looking 
at bulletin boards to see if any new post-
ers have been put up. “This is a means of 
getting money that I’m required to have in 
order to fucking live… So, it’s work.”


And others still are just opportunistic 
money-grubbers. The catchiest posters are 
those searching for “healthy, lean, and 
sedentary” volunteers. Sophomore Louis 
DeFelice fits the criteria, and has done 
the study twice, making $200 each time 
in return for chugging a glucose solution, 
spending four hours on an IV, wearing a 
pedometer for three days, and finally suffer-
ing through an MRI at the School of Med-
icine (he is claustrophobic). But for him, 
“the money is really tempting,” and his 
phobia matters less than the paycheck: “If 
you think you’re going to be in there for 40 
minutes and you’re gonna get $200, I don’t 
know… It’s a good hourly wage.” Besides 
involving more whirring metal tubes, the 
most extreme study he has done required 
him to fast for 48 hours, during midterms, 
on his birthday. (It paid close to $1000.) I 
felt compelled to ask him what he wouldn’t 
do. “There’s this famous experiment where 
these strangers come into a room and 
they’re delivering electric shocks to some-
one in another room…” 


If you’re willing to put up with a half 
hour of tedium—or just want some com-
pensation for researching a story—there’s 
petty cash to be made on campus. But the 
big bucks wait for those who chase these 
studies out of economic necessity or finan-
cial desire, sacrificing their time and bodies 
for cash: the true lab rats of Yale.
