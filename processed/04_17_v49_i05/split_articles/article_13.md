EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Most mornings, Jayson Peña wakes up early and loads 
the back of his Chevy Suburban with pigeons.
Using his bare hands, he pulls the birds out of a 
white-shingled loft in the backyard of his home in Avon, 
Connecticut. He grabs each grey body around its mid-
section, his thick brown fingers wrapping easily around 
the bird’s stomach and tail, holding its feet in place. The 
air around the coop is warm and acrid with guano—pi-
geon droppings—but the musk isn’t quite so bad in the 
morning. The birds get settled in their boxes, fleshy pink 
feet poking in and out, feather tips flaring upwards as they 
adjust their wings, getting caught momentarily between 
the bars. Dozens of pairs of red eyes blink up at Peña as he 
closes the crate door. One on top of the other, the boxes 
go into the trunk.

Peña backs down the driveway and drives through his 
neighborhood before merging onto Highway 4. Today, he 
pulls off of the road at the Bed Bath & Beyond in Farm-
ington, though he could just as easily stop at the cemetery 
off of Huckleberry Hill Road, or the grassy patch along 
the wide curve of Highway 177, or in the parking lot of 
a strip mall.

With his car engine stopped, Peña pops the trunk. He 
loosens the metal clasps of the bottom crate first, letting 
the leather flap door fall open, and for a moment, there is 
no movement at all. 
And then comes a rustle, a thrash, and a communal 
unfurling: a battery of wings, bodies, and twig-thin legs 
bursts forth. When that crate is empty, Peña loosens the 
ties on the second, and the process repeats. 
A flock of mottled grey creatures takes to the sky, circles 
the lot, and is gone.

Peña is in no rush. Today is a training day for the young 
birds, and since they’re only flying ten miles—a fraction 
of the length of their next race—there’s no way he can 
beat them back home. These are thoroughbred racing 
pigeons, after all: on a clear day, they can clock in an av-
erage speed of around 90 miles per hour.

Peña is a member of the Connecticut Classic Pigeon 
Racing Club, a loose confederation of middle-aged men 
living in Avon, Hartford, New Haven, and other small 
Connecticut hamlets. They share a love of birds and a 
passion for breeding them. Each man’s goal is to create, 
after many generations of pigeons, a bloodline whose 
birds are faster and stronger and smarter than the birds 
that came before them. They want to create champions.

But only so much can be predicted by a bird’s geneal-
ogy. Weather patterns, predatory hawks, power lines, fa-tigue, confusion, and other factors all alter a bird’s ability 
to return home. And, all else equal, much of a bird’s suc-
cess relies on its training.

Pigeon races, unlike 
similar competitions for 
grounded species, have 
no set path. Birds from 
multiple lofts across a 
region are brought to 
one starting point, usu-
ally a hundred or more 
miles from the pigeons’ 
homes, and released. 
From there, each bird 
charts his own way back.


Ornithologists estimate there are about 400 million 
pigeons worldwide, of which more than 60 million—or 
about 15 percent—are domesticated racing pigeons. 
And rearing these 60 million are somewhere around 1.2 
million breeders (or, as Peña and his cohort prefer to be 
called, “pigeon fanciers”). Once they are released, the pi-
geons’ keeper simply waits for their return. The rest is up 
to the birds. 

Birds have fascinated Peña since his childhood. He 
grew up in the rural Quezon province of the Philippines 
during a period of martial law that began in 1972. His 
town was overrun with semi-domesticated free-range 
chickens. “Shake a can, and two or three hundred would 
come running out of the bushes expecting food from 
you,” Peña says. At night, the chickens roosted in the trees 
to avoid ground predators. The guttural, clucking mur-
mur in the dark Quezon night became the white noise 
of Peña’s childhood. When he was seven, he asked his 
family for birds of his own. Their neighbors had a loft of 
pigeons, he mentioned to his father. Couldn’t they get 
some, too? Peña’s parents spoke with the neighbors, who 
were more than happy to share two brooding pigeons 
from their overpopulated coop.

But four years later, Peña’s family moved to an apart-
ment in the crowded capital city of Manila—no more 
chicken trees, no more Quezon fields, and no more room 
for a pigeon loft.

Shortly after high school, he moved again to Guam for 
the island’s “party lifestyle,” where he saw the newspaper 
advertisement that would reroute his life entirely: Athena 
Healthcare, a Farmington, Connecticut-based elder care 
company, was looking for applicants to fill positions as 
Certified Nursing Assistants. 

“Why not?” Peña remembers thinking to himself as he 
held the Sunday paper. He had never been to the main-
land. Within a week, Peña told his friends he was leav-
ing the island. No one believed him, but the next morn-
ing—carrying only his backpack, which held one change 
of clothes and his passport—Peña boarded a Greyhound 
bus that took him, along with dozens of other Filipino 
and Guamanian passengers, to the Antonio B. Won Pat 
International Airport in Guam.

“But what is it that makes a racing pigeon such an ob-
ject of interest to such vast sections of the population in so 
many parts of the world?” ponders Anthony F. Sciabarassi 
in the January 2015 issue of Pigeon Racing Digest. “It is 
my sincere belief that the answer lies very largely in the 
character of the bird itself. First and foremost is the bird’s 
own love of home.”

Kenneth Kuester, a materials assistant with Yale Uni-
versity’s Ecology department and a pigeon fancier him-
self, tells me that this homeward drive is one of the most 
baffling aspects of the pigeon. He’s been racing birds out 
of his home in East Haven since the 1970s, and says that 
even after almost fifty years of breeding, raising, and train-
ing them, he hasn’t figured out what it is that makes them 
so intent on getting home. Their desire to get back to their 
roost is so strong, Kuester says, that the birds will literally 
lose limbs, break bones, and still return to the coop.

“Each year, I lose about 25 percent of my young birds, 
mostly to Cooper’s hawks and power lines,” he says. 
“Sometimes they’ll return and you can see that their keel,” 
he motions towards his sternum, “right here, is just split 
in half from hitting a utility wire.” In those cases, Kuester 
says, the bird usually dies not long after his return. But un-
less the power line kills him on impact, or unless the hawk 
snatches him in mid-air, the bird will usually keep going, 
full-speed, until, exhausted, he finds his home.

Peña attests to this seemingly supernatural drive towards 
home, recalling that some of his pigeons have returned to 
the coop more than two years after leaving for a race (he 
identifies each bird using an ID band on their leg). Each 
time this happens, he is surprised: “You still remember 
me after two years not in my coop?” Usually, pigeon fan-
ciers assume that the birds’ homeward pull comes from a 
sort of imprinting process—like a baby duck who assumes 
the first animal he sees is his mother. But Peña said that 
in one case, a bird he purchased as an adult found its way 
to the loft after an entire year away. Sometimes, even late 
in life, the birds choose a new home.

Peña didn’t intend to stay in Connecticut. When he 
arrived in 2000, Athena Healthcare moved him, along 
with the other new immigrants in his program, into an 
eight-bedroom home in Torrington. Peña’s English was 
poor, which made the job and the transition challenging, 
but for the first six months of his stay in America, Athena 
provided rent, a transport van, and $300 per week in wag-
es. After the six months were up, Peña was told to find a 
place of his own.

Despite the abrupt eviction from the home, and the 
difficulty of saving up enough money to acquire a car and 
an apartment on only $300 a week, Peña felt exhilarated 
by the opportunities he saw in Connecticut. He applied 
for his green card to stay.

Not long after arriving, Peña met Kristina Guanzon, a 
nurse from the Philippines who had arrived in the Unit-
ed States a few years before, and who had made her way 
to Connecticut via Chicago. Like Peña, she had a round 
face, olive skin, black hair, and an easy smile. They fell 
in love.

“I traveled halfway around the world to meet you,” he 
remembers telling her.

In 2004, they returned to Peña’s home in the Philip-
pines, on the island of Zebu, so that Peña could ask her 
parents for her hand in marriage. As is customary in Fil-
ipino tradition, they were married near her childhood 
home. At the ceremony, Kristina and Peña released two 
white pigeons. 

A week later, they returned to Connecticut, and Peña 
decided to buy his first pigeon in North America. “I think 
I found it on Craigslist,” Peña recalls. He drove to Massa-
chusetts to pick up the bird and quickly began forging a 
network of fellow racers, first on Craigslist and eventually 
on Facebook. Since then, Peña’s friendships with other 
pigeon fanciers have developed to the point that he calls 
them a second family. “Quality friends. It’s hard to find 
those friends,” he says. “They’ll take their shirt off their 
back for you.”

Despite finding a support system in the racing commu-
nity, Peña claims that his hobby did not ease his process of 
moving to the United States. “It was actually hard in the 
beginning,” he says. He needed to find a home of his own 
in Connecticut, and he sought a town that would permit 
residents to keep pigeon coops.

Fortunately, Peña’s wife, Guanzon, has always been 
supportive of his passion for pigeons, given the positive
