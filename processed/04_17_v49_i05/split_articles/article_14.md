influence that pigeon racing has on his lifestyle. Instead 
of frequenting bars or causing trouble, as Peña claims he 
otherwise might, he devotes nearly all of his spare time 
outside the home to pigeons. “She knows where to find 
me,” Peña says of his wife, pausing to laugh as he reflects 
upon his time management. “I’ll be in my pigeon coop or 
I’ll be at my buddy’s where he’s got his pigeons.”
On race days, Peña waits outside of the loft in his back-
yard, throwing darts. Somewhere off in upstate New York, 
or rural Ohio, or Massachusetts, or Vermont, or New 
Hampshire, or Pennsylvania, a truck full of pigeons—
some of them belonging to Peña—pulls into a wide, 
green clearing.
With a heaving sound, the sliding metal doors of the 
truck click up and up until the shelves of birds are ex-
posed. A switch is flipped, the doors slide open, and a bat-
tery of birds spills out. Bodies tumble one into the next, 
wings thwacking onto wings, until, with a lifting motion, 
the birds spiral upwards, survey the land, and disperse, 
each making his or her own way home.
“When you let them out of the coop, they’re free,” Peña 
says as he watches his older retired birds waddle around 
on the roof of his house. “They’re pretty much on their 
own. If you love the pigeons, you watch for them to re-
turn. If they don’t like you, they just won’t come back to 
your house.” It has started to rain a little bit. “You always 
hope they’re in good hands, that someone’s taking care of 
them. That they’re not dead. But that’s the law of the land. 
It’s their freedom.”
