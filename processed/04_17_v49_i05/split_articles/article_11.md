cute its vision. Even as the organization attempts to bridge 
New Haven’s stratified communities, its own membership is 
mostly white and affluent—unlike most of the people who 
engage with its pieces on the street.  Many of the Site Proj-
ects board members don’t live in the communities where the 
group’s public art is being installed, or even in New Haven at 
all. “We would love to get people on our board that are more 
representative of the ethnic makeup of New Haven,” Clarke 
said. “But we are much more worried about getting people 
who are excited about New Haven art.”


And even if Site Projects’ pieces do help make New Haven 
a thriving cultural destination, the group’s success is inextri-
cably tied to gentrification––Professor de Bretteville readily 
acknowledged that the city only gave Site Projects permission 
to complete the Route 34 installation after a developer made 
plans to build a large-scale luxury housing complex in the 
area. 


But as he continues to investigate the lost Oak Street 
neighborhood, Greenberg is optimistic that art can help New 
Haven return to the lively pedestrian city that it once was. 
“Everything that got knocked down is getting built back,” he 
said. “The rainforest is growing back again.”


their success can be difficult to measure. But for some, even 
small moments are enough to affirm the organization’s aims. 
Bennett remembered hearing two strangers debate the role 
of art in activism on the bus ride home after a Site Projects 
event they had both attended. Clarke recalled seeing groups 
of teenagers converge on the huge lightshow they produced 
on the Green. “Kids on bikes would come through, eight, 
ten, twelve at a time,” she said. “They would stop and say, 
‘What is this?’ and we would say, ‘This is art.’ They would say, 
‘What is it for?’ and we would say ‘To look at.’”


With its next installation, Site Projects hopes to combat 
New Haven’s neighborhood divisions by transforming the 
pedestrian walkway under the Route 34 overpass near Union 
Station. The site is a lingering reminder of New Haven’s 
1950s-era urban renewal programs, which cleared so-called 
“slum” areas in the name of modernization and highway 
expansion. The construction of Route 34 razed the thriving 
immigrant communities of the Oak Street neighborhood 
and displaced the area’s predominantly Italian, Jewish, and 
African-American inhabitants. Those residents moved to 
new neighborhoods that became increasingly segregated by 
race. Today, the underpass is strewn with litter, the concrete 
stained with runoff water.


Robert Greenberg, a New Haven historian and preserva-
tionist, knows the detrimental effects of urban renewal first-
hand. His grandfather, a Russian immigrant, lost his business 
properties in the demolition of Oak Street. “Not only did they 
knock down buildings, they knocked out the entire commu-
nity,” he said. “Urban renewal created a huge scar on the 
city.”


Site Projects wants to make the busy pedestrian walk-
way—which connects the train station and the Church Street 
South housing projects to the downtown area—more wel-
coming and navigable. The new installation, Lighting Your 
Way, will be an interactive light sculpture along the segment 
of the walkway under the industrial overpass. Site Projects 
plans to widen the sidewalk and install six spotlights that will 
create pools of light on the concrete. Motion-activated LEDs 
along a low wall will light up sequentially as pedestrians walk 
by, and notecard-sized art pieces about the history of the site, 
created by local high school students, will hang on the wall.


Slated for completion in March 2018, Lighting Your Way 
is the brainchild of Sheila de Bretteville ART ’64, a public 
artist, Yale School of Art professor, and self-described “citi-
zen-pedestrian.” She first imagined the project after many 
walks under the Route 34 underpass, reflecting on the space’s 
unfriendly atmosphere and the fraught political history. 
Professor de Bretteville submitted her proposal to the city, 
and Site Projects approached her, offering to help fund and 
plan the projects. “People shouldn’t have to walk through 
neglected areas,” Professor de Bretteville said. “It shows that 
the city doesn’t care.”


Of course, it’s not always simple for Site Projects to exe-
