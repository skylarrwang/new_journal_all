EXPECTING AN EDUCATION
A school closing shifts the resources available to New Haven’s teen mothers
Vivian Wang
For a long time, the Polly T. McCabe Center wasn’t some-
where you went because you wanted to. You went because 
you had no other choice. At least, not really: If you were a 
pregnant teenager in New Haven, you needed a place where 
you could learn to feed your baby and change diapers and 
escape from the smirks and stares of your classmates, and you 
were not going to find that at your normal middle or high 
school. So you went to Polly McCabe, an alternative school 
established in 1966 for pregnant students in the New Haven 
Public School system. For the duration of your pregnancy 
and through the academic quarter after you gave birth, you 
would attend traditional classes like math and biology, plus 
courses tailored to the needs of pregnant students, such as 
nutrition and group counseling. And, perhaps more impor-
tantly, you were provided a refuge from the stigma of teen 
parenthood.
Today, “choice” is a loaded word in the contexts of both 
schools and pregnancy. But when Polly McCabe opened, the 
word was a bridge between those two worlds: for pregnant 
girls, a choice to go to Polly McCabe was a choice to stay in 
school. Their other options were bleak. They could either 
drop out immediately, or they could stay in their traditional 
schools without any special care or resources. A Yale study 
conducted at Polly McCabe in 2000, at the height of the 
school’s activity, found an 80 percent high school comple-
tion rate for its students. Nationwide, the current number for 
pregnant teens hovers around 50 percent.
 In the nineteen-nineties and early two-thousands, Polly 
McCabe served more than one hundred students every year. 
Last year, it served no more than sixteen—on a good day. 
While sixteen students were officially on the school roster, 
only four to seven attended regularly, said Dr. Belinda Car-

berry, who served as Polly McCabe’s principal for the last 
three years. Enrollment had been decreasing for decades, in 
line with plummeting teen pregnancy rates across the coun-
try: a 68 percent drop nationwide since 1991, 65 percent in 
Connecticut. Of the teens who did get pregnant, more and 
more were choosing to stay in the schools they had already 
been attending; New York City closed its four remaining “P” 
schools in 2007.
Last April, New Haven followed suit. The Board of Educa-
tion’s finance committee voted to stop providing services out 
of Polly McCabe’s Canner Street facility by the next academic 
year. Students now receive pregnancy support resources, 
under the McCabe name, from within mainstream schools. 
Although administrators emphasized that Polly McCabe was 
not closed, just reinvented, the fact remains that pregnant 
teens in New Haven now have fewer options when it comes 
to their education.
But given how few girls chose Polly McCabe in the last 
decade, how important, exactly, is that option anyway?
–
Administrators cited two main reasons for shuttering Polly 
McCabe: federal Title IX regulations and financial con-
straints. These justifications are closely intertwined. Title IX, 
passed six years after Polly McCabe’s founding, requires pub-
lic schools to provide equal resources to students regardless 
of sex. But it became increasingly difficult to provide com-
parable academic resources at Polly McCabe, said NHPS 
Director of Instruction Billy Johnson. There was “no way” 
the district, with its $4.6 million deficit, could afford to offer 
the same range of courses and electives at a school with four 
students as it could at one with hundreds, he said. 
By the end of last year, Polly McCabe no longer offered 
art, world languages, or science classes. And because grad-
uation requirements are consistent district-wide, many new 
mothers were missing the credits they needed when they 
returned to their original schools after giving birth, under-
mining Polly McCabe’s goal of helping pregnant students get 
their diplomas. 
New Haven’s high school landscape also may have con-
tributed to the decline in enrollment. In addition to its tradi-
tional high schools, New Haven is home to a variety of mag-
net schools with highly specialized curricula: Hill Regional 
Career focuses on medicine and entrepreneurship; Co-Op 
on the arts. Polly McCabe likely felt increasingly limiting, 
Johnson explained. “The reality [is]...when it has ten differ-
ent high schools to compete with, that’s a totally different ball 
game,” he said. 
And so the school was caught in a vicious cycle. The fewer 
choices that Polly McCabe offered, the fewer students it 
attracted; the fewer students who enrolled, the fewer choices 
the school could offer. In 2014, the most recent year for 
which the state has data, there were 137 teen births in New 
Haven. Less than 15 percent of those mothers enrolled at 
Polly McCabe. 
Arguably, those 15 percent had no need to: all the resources 
those students could have received at 400 Canner Street are 
now available in their traditional schools.
In a quiet corner of James Hillhouse High School on Sher-
man Avenue, Sharon Bradford sits in an office plastered with 
posters of young mothers cradling their babies. On her desk, 
she keeps a copy of the summer 2016 Southern Connecticut 
State University alumni magazine, which profiles a former 
Hillhouse student and teen mother who won a full Gates 
Millennium scholarship for college. Several decades ago, 
Bradford was also a teen mother in New Haven. In this room, 
secluded from the hallways where students weave around 
each other like cars on a busy freeway, she now heads the 
Support for Pregnant and Parenting Teens Program (SPPT), 
a statewide support program. 
SPPT, established in 2012, is funded by a combination 
of state and federal programs. It operates in five Connecti-
cut school districts, including New Haven; now that Polly 
McCabe no longer occupies a physical space, the services it 
used to offer have been folded into SPPT. Each year, Brad-
ford and her staff meet with sixty to seventy students across 
the district—mothers and fathers—several times a week, 
depending on the students’ needs. They track the teenagers’ 
school attendance, coach them through conflicts with their 
partners, or just share M&Ms.
Daphney St. Louis, a Hillhouse sophomore, said she never 
considered decamping for Polly McCabe when she became 
pregnant with her son, who is now three months old. 
“I had support here,” she explained one Monday morning 
as she sat in Bradford’s office. The SPPT program provided 
St. Louis with advice, a car seat, and a breast pump. She still 
visits the office almost every day to do her homework and 
chat. 
Since Polly McCabe’s founding in 1966, New Haven’s 
support services for teen mothers have grown. In the early 
1990s, a group of Yale Law School students opened the 
Elizabeth Celotto Child Care Center, which operates out 
of Wilbur Cross High School and provides free childcare to 
teen parents district-wide who stay in school. Director Robin 
Moore-Evans said the center provides many services similar 
to the SPPT program, including academic advising and par-
