**Title: CONSENT IN THE SPOTLIGHT**
**Author: Sarah Holder**

Center stage at the Iseman Theater, a woman stands 
clutching two hands to her chest in front of seventy-five 
first-year students of the Yale School of Drama. “These are 
my breasts,” she says. “These are Evan’s breasts, and when I 
come to rehearsal, I don’t want you to touch them.” 
The students gape. It’s day three of their first week of grad-
uate school, and many of them have never heard a professor 
talk about her body so frankly. “Over the course of rehearsal, 
they become Blanche’s breasts,” she continues, referring to 
the female lead of A Streetcar Named Desire. “And if the 
play calls for another character to touch Blanche’s breasts, 
that’s fine. But the question is, how do we get there, from 
here?”
The woman onstage is Evan Yionoulis, a professor of act-
ing at the School of Drama. (She is also my mother, which 
makes the boob grab especially uncomfortable.) This after-
noon she isn’t teaching drama, but rather the kind of behav-
ior needed to decrease the rate of sexual harassment among 
her students. 
When last year’s Association of American Universities’ 
(AAU) Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Sex-
ual Misconduct was released, graduate school faculty and 
students were shocked at the high rates of sexual harassment: 
53.9 percent of female, 38.2 percent of male, and 78 percent 
of other gender graduate and professional students reported 
having experienced it in some form while at Yale. The School 
of Drama is not the only graduate school that ramped up its 
sexual assault prevention measures in the wake of the report. 
The School of Architecture and School of Public Health 
have also scrambled to respond to the AAU findings. And, 
as the accusations against Donald Trump during the 2016 
presidential campaign demonstrate, harassment is a prob-
lem that doesn’t end once confessed. The AAU survey was 
just a tangible, and troubling, set of statistics that quantified 
a cultural issue already on the minds of many.
The School of Drama is in a unique position, however, 
in that it is a place where students are asked to fully inhabit 
their characters and engage in physical, sensitive, and some-
times violent behavior. Students are trained in the art of fab-
ricating intimacy, learning to flirt and fight and fall in love 
so convincingly they might believe it themselves.
“It’s the only school where faculty are directing naked stu-
dents,” laughs Joan Channick, Associate Dean and Deputy 
Title IX Coordinator for the School of Drama. It’s the only 
school where “a professor might say, ‘You should really get 
in touch with your sexuality,’” adds Emily Reeder, a theater 
management student at the School of Drama and a mem-
ber of the Graduate & Professional Student Title IX board. 
It’s the only school where, in the classroom and on stage, 
students and faculty are talking about, depicting, and reen-
acting sex. The environment of the stage, coupled with an 
emphasis on artistic freedom, creates a space with the poten-
tial for abuse. 
In response to the AAU survey results and a growing 
consciousness of sexual violence, the School of Drama has 
made a few changes. Along with creating a new orientation 
for first-year students and updating a “Bystander Interven-
tion” workshop for all students, they released a constitution 
of sorts: “Protocols for Rehearsing Material With Sexual 
Content, Consensual Sexual Touching, and Depicting Sex-
ual Assault.”
These rules of conduct are meant to ensure that depic-
tions of sexual behavior and assault “will only be rehearsed 
or performed with the ongoing affirmative consent of all 
actors,” and provide safety guidelines for pre-production, 
rehearsal, and classroom scene work. Every student and fac-
ulty member has to read, sign, and return the document to 
the registrar at the start of each semester, and every visiting 
artist working at the Yale Repertory Theater must sign and 
send in the protocols with their contract. With this docu-
ment and its rollout, the School of Drama wants to encour-
age a shift in consent culture. They want to combat the high 
numbers from the AAU report. 
But opening up more conversations about sexual con-
sent has led the School of Drama to another issue—one 
that most, if not all, other departments never have to deal 
with. As Evan-not-Blanche’s breast clutching demonstrated, 
the line between actor and person is constantly shifting on 
stage. It’s in this middle ground that things can go wrong, 
but it’s also the space where artistry is cultivated. How, then, 
do you identify assault in the rehearsal room or on stage? 
And how do you make art, particularly art that’s supposed to 
be painful, safe?

Baize Buzan is pushed and falls face down in a pile of 
dirt. Below her, a wedding dress blooms. Behind her, a man 
lunges and paws at the chiffon. Before them, almost two 
hundred people watch as she is violently raped. Her knees 
are chewed up, her hands scratched. On good nights, she 
doesn’t bleed.
Buzan is an actress at the School of Drama, and the man 
lunging is her scene partner and fellow student, Galen Kane. 
They are performing in the play Women Beware Women, 
which opened in January 2016 at Yale Repertory Theater. 
Here, on stage, Buzan is safe, and the simulated rape is con-
sensual: she and her imagined assailant have practiced these 
moves hundreds of times with the help of a fight choreogra-
