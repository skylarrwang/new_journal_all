We continue to talk—about the man’s partner, 
about our own partners, our own histories. 
At that point, I stop taking notes. There is no need. 
I remember the night clearly. We had shared 
secrets and now, I can only write so much.

At the same time, Metroline writers envisioned 
brighter futures. An op-ed in a 1994 issue by Larry 
Kirk titled “THE YEAR OF QUEER” reads: “It 
is through such actions that our movement will ulti-
mately prevail, that the world will be made safer for a 
new generation of gay boys and girls. If this can hap-
pen in 1994, it will indeed be the Year of the Queer, 
no matter what else may, or may not occur.” The 
magazine attempted to immortalize turbulent and 
frustrating moments. But, the pages are yellowed. 
They carry a faint scent of dust. The advertisements 
and pictures look inexplicably off-kilter, an estrange-
ment only time can inflict.
Seth’s face changes, just slightly, after he sips 
his drink.
“What about the people that aren’t here?” He 
says, his voice eases. “They have got no clue of under-
standing, all the sacrifice and all the commitment to 
equality that went down to create this, to bring it 
to fruition.”
T
he next night, I talk with Bryan. He works 
behind the counter at 168 York some nights. He 
doesn’t like the title “bartender,” though. Making 
drinks is a gig he fell into by happenstance. A few 
years ago, Bryan walked into 168 York on a whim. 
He sat by himself at a table by the windows. Across 
the room, Joey played setback with some friends. 
Bryan watched, then eventually joined. They would 
play together every week for two years. One day, a 
bartender position opened, and Joey hired Bryan 
on the spot.
“He looked to me like, you’re gonna be my new 
bartender. I said ‘No, no. I’ve never done this before,’” 
Bryan says. Then, jokingly: “It just kept happening. I 
can’t get out of it. I can’t make it stop!”
Bryan says he is at a strange age, describing 
himself as being “right in the middle.” He didn’t 
live through the AIDS epidemic like the generation 
before him. But he says he wasn’t exactly marked 
by the “acceptance” that seems to define the current 
generation. He remembers growing up with stories 
of Matthew Shepard, a gay student at the University 
of Wyoming who was killed in 1998 as a result of an 
anti-gay hate crime. He still remembers when polit-
ical parties across the spectrum all opposed gay mar-
riage. Now, he notices the stark differences. 
“I cannot just so unapologetically go to any bar I 
want to with a boy and feel comfortable kissing that 
person,” he says. “You feel comfortable kissing every-
one until you do that in the wrong place. You don’t 
understand the importance of having a safe place. 
And why gay bars are so in need of being protected 
as safe spaces.”
As he talks, I notice that remembrance for 
Bryan is significant. He takes pride in remember-
ing this past era. Certain traditions he still upholds 
with other bar-goers. Inside gay bars, Bryan calls his 
friends “Mary,” after a practice in the 80’s and 90’s of  
men calling their partners “Mary” to obscure the fact 
that they were seeing men. Inside the bar, Bryan only 
responds to feminine pronouns. Though this practice 
started off as a protection measure, Bryan reclaims it 
as a method of remembering queer culture. 
“Why do we do that? I’m using these pronouns 
in a different capacity because that’s what historically 
what we built on, from the raiding of bars,” he says. 
“Was I a part of that? No, I wasn’t a part of that. Do 
I know a little bit of that history? Do I want to keep 
some of those things alive? Absolutely.”
“This is your way of remembrance,” I say.
“Absolutely. How do we move forward from that, 
while still acknowledging and respecting by main-
taining our culture?” he says. “Are you looking at 
America? Like, where are we going right now? We’ve 
already done all this stuff and now we’re going back 
because we’ve forgotten what we’ve already done.”
When he finishes, Bryan leaves me to tend to a 
regular, a man in a checkered shirt. As he pours a 
drink for the man, he asks where the man’s partner 
is. Before he can answer, Bryan asks if they had been 
fighting again. The two laugh. Bryan introduces me 
to the man. I also ask where this man’s partner is. We 
continue to talk—about the man’s partner, about our 
own partners, our own histories. At that point, I stop 
taking notes. There is no need. I remember the night 
clearly. We had shared secrets and now, I can only 
write so much.

n a corner room at Partners, I play pool with 
a stranger who is old enough to be my father. I 
don’t call him my father, but I imagine that he is to 
feign some intimacy. It is a close game, only because 
we are both bad shots. In between turns, we talk. He 
is an artist from New York, but whenever he is in 
town, he stops by Partners for a drink. In the end, he 
beats me by just one ball. I’m lucky we haven’t bet 
on anything.
“You’re supposed to be better than me,” he says, 
laughing. “I’m all old now.”
He grabs his quarters and his bag. Before he 
leaves, though, I ask if I could see his art. He spreads 
his notepads across the pool table. They are worn. 
One by one, he shows me his drawings, each a sketch 
of a previous lover. Or a friend. Or a lover of a friend. 
They are all nude. He tells me how he fell in and out 
of love with one of the naked men. And as he talks, I 
realize the man misses him. Some of these men, he 
still visits back in New York. Others have since died. 
He doesn’t mention anything more. His eyes soften 
on the pages. 
It’s karaoke night. In the background, a man 
sings “Bad Romance.” He’s impressively offkey. A 
group of people laugh. They all clink their glasses. 
I stay for a few more minutes, humming along 
to the Lady Gaga song. The man reaches the final 
chorus, and people begin clapping. I leave soon 
after. Walking down Crown Street, I shiver. It has 
suddenly become cold. ∎
