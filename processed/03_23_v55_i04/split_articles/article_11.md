Points of Departure
A Scene of 
Outsiders
At Space Ballroom, Danya Blokh is 
in for a night of “non-denominational, 
non-binary” hardcore.

O
n February 12, 2023, Hamden’s 
Space Ballroom was a veritable con-
vention of musical subgenres. Millennial 
hardcore fans in gray hoodies with the 
hoods up, older bearded metalheads 
wearing band T-shirts, and young queer 
punks with piercings and tattoos milled 
about the small, dim venue. The crowd’s 
energy felt more like a school dance than 
a punk show, and even though small mosh 
pits formed for hard-hitting local hard-
core bands Intercourse and Kidnapped, 
they fizzled out quickly once it became 
clear that most fans preferred watching to 
dancing. As a casual fan of hardcore who 
had always enjoyed the collective cathar-
sis of a good mosh-pit, I came toward the 
front of the audience and hoped for some 
mayhem as the headliner, Space Camp, 
ascended to the stage.

I got mayhem, alright. June Aino and 
Daisy Josefa, the two vocalists and core 
members of Space Camp, led a pleth-
ora of supporting musicians up to the 
platform, packing the small stage with 
an upright bass, a cello, a sousaphone, a 
trombone, a synth and a drum set, with 
a second drummer set up in the middle 
of the audience. The musicians smiled 
broadly as they sound checked, their 
classical instruments contrasting starkly 
with their tattooed arms and all-black 
outfits. But nothing could have prepared 
me for the overwhelming cacophony of 
orchestral punk that followed. Somehow, 
with no guitar or bass, Space Camp’s 
music was more forceful than any punk 
band I’d heard.

With the drummer in the middle 
of the crowd, there wasn’t any room to 
start a mosh pit. But there was no need 
for one; the crowd’s attention was fix-
ated on the hardcore symphony before 
us. The chaos I’d expected in the audi-
ence was happening on stage instead: 
June and Daisy screamed powerfully, the 
brass instruments boomed, and the sec-
ond drummer wielded a drill during one 
song and a bugle horn during another. 
One local reviewer noted in their article 
about the concert that the sheer force of 
Space Camp’s sound shattered a light-
bulb in the bathroom, but no one around 
me blinked an eye. As one of the attend-
ees, Connecticut resident Myles Vincent, 
phrased it afterwards, “it’s just an explo-
sion. Rather than going to see a band go 
to play their songs, it’s like you’re going 
to see something go down.”

Brass instruments and power tools 
are rare at most live shows, but particu-
larly in hardcore, an aggressive offshoot 
of punk music with a relatively strict 
sound and ethos. While the genre var-
ies between bands and over time, there 
is nonetheless a defined set of expecta-
tions for hardcore songs: fast and brutal 
riffs, deeply screamed vocals, and cli-
mactic song sections called “breakdowns” 
intended to make listeners go wild in 
the mosh pit. Historically, hardcore’s 
aggressive attitude, as well as its lyrical 
preference for themes like hometown 
pride and the straight-edge lifestyle 
over the progressive politics of anarchist 
bands, attracted mostly male musicians 
and listeners to hardcore shows. Space 
Camp’s novel sound, which their bio 
calls “non-denominational, non-binary 
hardcore,” is unique in a genre as stylisti-
cally codified as hardcore. Consequently, 
whenever they’re booked on a show with 
a bunch of hardcore bands, “it’s a mixed 
bill, because we have single handedly 
mixed the bill,” says Daisy. 

Yet this very love for instrumental 
play created Space Camp in the first 
place. June and Daisy became friends in 
fourth grade after finding themselves to 
be among the few fourth graders regis-
tered to learn trombone at their South 
Windsor Elementary School. “Our 
houses were so close together that we 
could walk through a neighborhood 
and some woods and be at each other’s 
houses,” says June when I speak with the 
band a few days after the show. Daisy 
started playing guitar and drums, while 
June kept learning trombone and picked 
up keys, and they briefly experimented 
with surf rock in high school before 
officially forming Space Camp in March 
2013. Their playful debut record consists 
of Daisy playing drums, June playing 
synth, and a friend reading passages 
aloud from books they found in their 
practice space. “At the time we were like, 
this is a cool concept,” says Daisy. “It’s since 
been wiped from the internet.”

In 2014, the band added a bassist, 
June introduced a full piano in addition 
to their microKORG synth, and Space 
Camp began booking more shows and 
seriously recording music. Their stylis-
tic influences at the time were hardcore 
bands like Ceremony, Punch, and Code 
Orange Kids, whose influence is still evi-
dent in Space Camp’s roughly screamed 
vocals, ominously dissonant chords, and 
punchy song sections. “We’ve always 
been suckers for a lip-curling hard-
core breakdown,” Daisy tells me. Yet 
instrumental diversity remained inte-
gral to their ethos; listening through 
their Bandcamp releases, you’ll hear just 
about everything—tuba, guitar, contra-
bass, oboe—all absorbed into their heavy 
punk sound. Their latest album Gold Star 
was released in January of this year and 
continues this tradition with twenty-nine 
minutes of magnificent auditory havoc.

Space Camp’s take on hardcore has 
thrived in Connecticut largely because of 
the state’s unique music scene. Whereas 
more densely populated states tend to 
stratify into separate subgenres with 
minimal overlap, Connecticut’s small 
size leads to a melding of styles perfect 
for Space Camp’ eclectic blend of genres. 
As Daisy says, there’s a distinct charm 
to a place where only one show is hap-
pening on a given night: “If it’s a Friday 
night in Philadelphia in July, there’s six 
shows going on. You can get the best 
line-up at a sick venue, and everyone 
you know will still text you and say, sorry, 
we’re going to another show. But if we’re 
playing in Connecticut, everyone who’s 
interested is there, it is the thing to do.”

Space Camp is only one example of 
Connecticut bands’ propensity for music 
experimentation. Tarek, the lead singer 
of Intercourse, says there’s an entire 
scene of local experimental punk—“I 
call it outsider hardcore”—dedicated 
to fostering a left-leaning, welcoming 
milieu opposed to the exclusivity of 
more regimented music scenes. “We’re 
not into that macho, gatekeepy shit,” he 
says proudly. Intercourse, which has been 
playing since 2014 and is soon releas-
ing their new album Halo Castration 
Institute, is itself a genre-bending project 
too, with “one foot in hardcore and one 
foot in noise rock.” 

The Connecticut scene’s inclusivity 
doesn’t just apply to the music, but also 
to the community itself. While hardcore 
is often perceived as a hypermasculine 
boy’s club, Connecticut’s outsider hard-
core shows are “a place for a lot of people 
where they can go and be themselves,” 
says Tarek. “If you want to wear make-up 
and goth out, no one’s gonna bat an eye.” 
Tarek, whose family is Egyptian, grew up 
as one of the only people of color in the 
small town of Naugatuck, Connecticut. 
His upbringing was full of alienating 
and aggressive encounters with white 
schoolmates. Connecticut’s music scene 
was also exclusionary, though in differ-
ent ways. “People at shows used to tell 
me, don’t wear a Marilyn Manson shirt or 
you’ll get the shit beat out of you, make sure 
to wear a Cannibal Corpse shirt or some-
thing neutral,” Tarek remembers, laugh-
ing. Yet the young, left-leaning audience 
of Connecticut’s current outsider hard-
core scene makes no space for such hos-
tility, from musical elitism to racism and 
misogyny.  “There’s lots of trans people, 
there’s lots of queer people, there’s lots 
of people of color. This is a really inclu-
sive scene for everybody, and we’re really 
proud of that. We’ve had people come 
through and say, wow, this little niche of 
Connecticut is really special.” 

This warm and welcoming attitude 
suffused the venue after Space Camp’s 
set concluded. Young newcomers to the 
scene and longtime outsider hardcore fans 
alike chatted eagerly with me about what 
we’d just experienced together and about 
other shows they’d recently attended. If 
the disparate contingents had struggled to 
gel at the start of the night, the singular 
intensity of Space Camp’s eclectic sound 
seemed to have bonded everyone at the 
Space Ballroom, dissolving any residual 
awkwardness in the space.

I shook hands with Daisy and 
Tarek, who both warmly thanked me 
for coming and told me they’d be glad 
to interview. In the merch line, one fan 
told me he’d grown up in Connecticut, 
moved to Austin for nearly a decade, 
and only just returned. The scene in his 
time had been aggressive and intimidat-
ing, he told me, and the warmth of Space 
Ballroom’s crowd shocked him. Though 
this was his first time seeing Space Camp, 
his beaming smile while talking about 
his experience at the concert suggested 
he was bound to become an outsider 
hardcore regular.

I left with a newly purchased Space 
Camp T-shirt tucked under my arm. 
Every time I’ve worn it since, at least one 
person has stopped me to ask if I caught 
them at Space Ballroom. Daisy was right 
about the perks of a small music scene; 
these people really had all been to the 
same show as me. The next time I find 
myself toppled over in a Connecticut 
hardcore mosh pit, I’m certain one of 
these familiar faces will be around to lift 
me up. ∎
