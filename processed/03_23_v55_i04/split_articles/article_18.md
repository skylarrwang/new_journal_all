Is gay nightlife getting quieter? 
A writer explores the histories 
inside New Haven gay bars.

t is a building that looks like it is hiding. 
Some windows are blurred with frosted glass. 
Others are boarded up. The walls are painted 
an aged white, peeling at some parts. On the 
side of the building, a small, orange sign names 
the building: Partners. Underneath a piercing street-
light, just next to the mural of a smiling Anne Frank, 
a man stands by himself, a lit cigarette in his mouth. 
Nothing on the outside reveals that the building is 
one of the oldest gay bars in New Haven.

On Fridays and Saturdays, Partners opens its 
second floor to reveal a glittery night club. There, 
mirrors cover the walls and a spinning light shines 
on young, dancing bodies in the dark. Those are the 
endless nights—loud and hazy and crowded. On 
Sundays, the second floor closes, leaving the ground 
floor open for karaoke night. It draws in a smaller 
crowd. Now, it’s Monday night in February and the 
bar is barren—except for Paul, me, and two drunk 
men. The two men had waited outside the bar’s front 
door before he’d arrived. Now, they sit at the counter 
with me, babbling over each other. They interrupt 
Paul while he talks to me, asking for another drink. 
Paul leaves to fill up their shot glasses.
“I was telling him how annoying it is when peo-
ple showed up to the bar at seven fifty-nine, knock-
ing on the door,” Paul says, nodding towards me.

They cackle in response.
“If your ass is open at eight, you better be open,” 
one of them shoots back. 

Paul half-smiles. Then, he turns to me and rolls 
his eyes. 

I like Paul for two reasons. The first is that he 
speaks to me like a friend. By nature, I am an anxious 
person. Despite this, we quickly chat like two old gos-
sips. The second is that he is seasoned. He moved to 
New Haven from Massachusetts over a decade ago 
to work at Partners. This is his eleventh year behind 
the counter, and it shows—he is fluid, quick with his 
words. He’s seen more than me. 
“So what was the gay bar scene like when you 
first started working here?” I ask.
“I want to say it was more gay men. Today, we 
have everything. Like, sometimes I’m working and 
I’m like, when did this become a straight bar?” he says, 
pouring another drink for one of the men. “There’s a 
lot of different types of people that come in and out 
of here all the time.”

As he talks, these broad terms—“everything,” 
“different types of people”—become clearer. Paul 
tells me that Partners defines itself as a gay bar, a 
gathering ground that has historically served queer 
people in New Haven. However, the events that the 
bar hosts—karaoke open-mics, bingo nights, goth 
dances, drag shows—now draw in straight people 
alongside the typically queer crowd. It isn’t abnor-
mal to run into straight couples on a Friday night. 
Partners’ clientele widened over the years; the bar 
became a space for a broader, open-minded commu-
nity, rather than a specific queer one. Though these 
capacities still have queer communities in mind, the 
formerly rigid boundaries have blurred.
“So the culture of the clientele has changed?” I ask.
“Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it doesn’t ruin the vibes 
or anything. It’s just that times are changing. Gay 
bars, straight bars, you’re going anywhere you want,” 
Paul says. “No one’s really afraid to come here any-
more. I mean, ten years ago, the straight men, they’d 
be like, ‘Oh, my God, I’m not going to a gay bar.’”

I understand. The culture change Paul talks about 
is something that has manifested in my generation, 
my lifetime. I was twelve when the Supreme Court 
recognized gay marriage as a legal right. I watched 
characters on television proclaim their gayness to 
accepting arms. I had openly queer friends who I 
fought and reconciled and grew up with. Whenever 
I hated myself, I could look at my queer friends and 
recognize that they were lovable. And through my 
love for them, I knew I was lovable too. In an odd 
way, I recognize that my ability to do this is evidence 
of an undeniable societal shift. Could this shift change 
landscapes of queer gathering? What happens to a space 
when the stigmatization that used to define it is dissolv-
ing? I think these questions as Paul talks.
“Then, does this mean gay bars are not needed 
anymore?” I ask. “As opposed to, say, any old bar?”
“Well, we still need them. I mean, Partners? It’s 
always going to be Partners. Everyone’s going to be 
coming here,” he says, assuredly. “It’s just now, it’s 
like a space for almost everybody.”
“So what does Partners mean to you?” I ask.
“A paycheck,” Paul jokes. The two drunk men 
next to me laugh.


meet Bernard at Partners, two hours before 
opening. I have never seen the bar so empty and 
quiet. The main room is dark except for two spot-
lights that shine overhead. We sit in adjacent seats 
by the counter. I begin to fidget. When I look at 
Bernard’s hands, I notice that he, too, is fidgeting. 
Bernard mentions growing up in a conservative 
family in a small town in Mexico. In 1993, Bernard 
immigrated to the United States. He was in his 
twenties and exploring New Haven gay bars. At 
Partners, he met Dave Klemens. Today, the two 
are married and run the bar together as co-own-
ers. According to Bernard, not much has changed 
over the years in how they run their business. They 
have their cheap drinks, their drag shows, their busy 
weekends and softer weekends. 
“The community has been evolving but we don’t 
exactly change with them, you know,” he says. “You 
can do everything on phones. But I mean, per-
son-to-person is better. I don’t know how to explain 
it.” He pauses. Then—“That was the model the previ-
ous owners founded. And Dave kept doing the same 
thing. If it’s not broken, why fix it?”

Gay bars depend on the “person-to-person” 
model that Bernard emphasizes in a way that dif-
fers from any other bar. Usually, people go to bars to 
meet other people over a drink, to form a commu-
nity, to relax and let loose. But the notion of a gay 
man letting loose is a radical act in this context. It 
means sexual identities could finally be actualized. It 
means camaraderie in a society that has condemned
