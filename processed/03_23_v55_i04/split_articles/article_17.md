At seventeen, I devoted myself to the pursuit 
of eroticism. Evolutionary imperatives 
necessitated a baseline sexual appetite, but I 
was more concerned with Sontag. “In place 
of a hermeneutics we need an erotics of art,” 
Sontag contends in her 1966 essay “Against 
Interpretation.” In a miasma of theory, she 
believed that art had lost its fervor. Now, with 
heads cocked to analysis, audiences set out on 
interpretive undertakings at the first twitch of 
a curtain rising, at the edge of a frame, in the 
didactic aisles of a title page. We no longer laid 
ourselves bare and let art wash over us. We no 
longer felt the acerbic burn when its saline waves 
seeped into wounds we had forgotten.

I was no different. An erudite floozy, I had taken 
to reading the wall text before looking at the 
painting. No longer! With “Against Interpretation” 
in tow, I set out to let art stir me. Orgasm was 
the endgame. But like an addict whose senses 
were dulled by their fix, I could no longer get off 
on art alone. I craved a hit of theory, chased the 
electric jolt of recognizing classical allusion. I 
was Paolo and Francesca in Dante’s fifth Canto, 
tossed about by blustering waves of desire. Fuck, 
that was good. 

Music was my first exception. If I sat very still in 
the dark and turned my headphones as loud as 
they would go, I could start to detect the buds 
of excitement. Alone in my room, I had no one 
to tell that Berlioz was quoting the dies irae in 
the fifth movement of “Symphonie Fantastique.” 
Instead, I let the crashing gongs throb unanalyzed. 
I trembled with emotion. I was redeemed.


**Title: Grocery Store**

I learned desire in the aisles of the grocery store. 
It was a world of pleasure, of throbbing 
stimulation and tantalizing unknowns. So many 
things were off-limits: cheese puffs beckoning 
me with their curved fingers; cookies in perfect 
rows, glistening through plastic windows; bottles 
of soda, jewel-like in their translucent vibrancy 
(surely the liquid itself was not that bright green, 
I reasoned, and what did a mountain taste like?); 
rows and rows of cereal boxes like a city on the 
cutting edge of nightlife, fractal-like in their 
varieties—this one chocolate and that fruity, this 
with raisins and that oat clusters, this frosted 
and that with marshmallows and another frosted 
and with marshmallows! The hope that these 
delicacies could one day be mine helped me cope 
with the profound emptiness I felt knowing that 
there existed flavors and textures beyond my 
wildest dreams. With the barebone constituents 
of my existing culinary experience, I cobbled 
together succulent fantasies to tide me over until 
I could satiate myself for real. I imagined frosting 
so creamy it felt like the softest part of a child’s 
palm, chocolate so expertly balanced between 
sweet and bitter it could remain upright on a 
tightrope, gelatinous candies that my teeth would 
sink into like they were slipping into sleep.

parties were. She felt that these oppor-
tunities were somewhat scarce, and felt 
anxious about not taking full advan-
tage of them. “I went with friends who 
all peeled off and found other people 
to have sex with,” she recalls. She adds 
that she was pleasantly surprised by the 
amount of lesbians of color there, but “at 
any Yale space,” she acknowledges, “as a 
queer [woman of color], if you’re trying 
to get laid, it’s going to be hard.” Still, 
she came away grateful for the experi-
ence, and excited for next semester. But 
before the next party, Covid hit.

Today: Everyone is gay
A
s of 2023, “lesbian life” or “queer 
women’s life” spills out into much of 
everyday life at Yale. With outness not 
only encouraged at Yale, but essentially 
the default in vast swathes of the campus’ 
academic and social world, many lesbi-
ans don’t have to look for “lesbian groups” 
or “gay issues” to find the comfort and 
community they seek. “It felt like my life 
was inherently a queer space in a way I 
never experienced before college,” Mia 
explains. Many other queer students 
echoed this sentiment, feeling that while 
they variously enjoyed Sappho parties, 
they didn’t feel the need to attend them 
to find sex, love, or friendship.

“I don’t think I hang out with any-
one who isn’t queer,” Ava Dadvand, 
an Iranian trans lesbian, decided after 
thinking for a moment. She finds most 
of her queer friends through Beyond 
the Binary, an official on-campus trans 
and nonbinary social group, as well as 
through social media, friends of her 
partner, and other mutual friends. A lot 
of it is incidental. On an increasingly 
“out” campus, you can meet other lesbi-
ans and sapphic people with ease from a 
class seminar to the line for lunch. Add 
in the queer-centric social spaces of Yale 
Twitter, as well as the opportunities for 
casual sex and romance from dating apps, 
and you’re giving Sappho-specific bulle-
tins like Sappho.blog and Hey Girl! a run 
for their money.

The definition of a “lesbian social 
space” is also increasingly changing as 
the idea of “lesbianism” does. While the 
Sappho of the early 2010s nominally 
included trans women in the labeling of 
their organization (if not in the content 
of their blogs and zines), the language of 
the world of “lesbians” has become more 
complex and gender-diverse as medical 
and social transition become increasingly 
possible. Last semester, I had top sur-
gery through Yale Health. Newly healed 
this semester, I feel more comfortable at 
parties and excited to dance, but more 
anxious in things closer to “women’s 
spaces.” I jump back at the thought of 
throwing someone off in a bathroom 
or changing room. I believe “lesbian 
spaces’’ can, and should, include people 
like me, but I don’t always feel at ease 
in those dominated by cisgender, gen-
der-conforming women. The concept 
of a “lesbian-only” or “woman-only” 
space can sometimes be code for “cis 
women-only,” something Maia worried 
about when I described Sappho parties 
to her over the phone. “The parties aren’t 
trans-exclusionary, right?” she asked 
sharply. I assured her that they weren’t, 
at least not in their advertising. But it’s 
certainly possible that some trans people 
stay away.

Ava is perfectly happy finding a 
home in what she calls “dyke spaces,” 
but also notes that she’s found it a lot 
easier since she had bottom surgery last 
summer. She concedes that this sounds 
“bioessentialist” of her, overly focused 
on genitalia as the site of sexuality. 
But, after all, she explains, our society 
is bioessentialist. “It’s drilled into our 
heads, for better or for worse, that lesbi-
anism is associated with pussy.”

While campus “lesbian life” has 
become more trans, Sappho parties have 
arguably become less so. After the onset 
of Covid-19, what events have popped 
up feel distinctly lackluster. Lily, a senior 
who started attending Sappho events 
in 2022, describes the two parties they 
stopped by simply as “boring.” The music 
was soft, the drinks were sparse, and the 
energy was conversational—more of an 
“affinity group” than a party space. After 
recently beginning to present more mas-
culine, they were acutely aware that the 
people they met at a fall 2022 Sappho 
party were “almost all femmes, and pretty 
white too.” They headed home early.

Attendance at these last two parties 
was small, something exemplified by the 
relative lack of undergraduate knowl-
edge about Sappho. When I asked her 
about Sappho parties, Ava, who arrived 
at Yale in 2021, confessed “I don’t know 
what that is.” The same things that make 
Sappho exciting, flexible, and cool—the 
lack of Yale institutional ties or funding, 
the informality of leadership, word of 
mouth—also make the whole operation 
hard to maintain. By the time someone 
intending to throw a Sappho party has 
the means to bring their idea to fruition, 
they may have already graduated. Not to 
mention, there’s no unified vision behind 
what makes a Sappho party “good.”

I, for one, don’t want the Sappho 
party tradition to die out. Lesbian night-
life on campus—the kinds experienced 
by Ettinger in the nineteen-eighties, or 
what Anna reveled in as a first-year—is 
facing a number of challenges. The dif-
ficulties of resurrecting marginalized 
party spaces after Covid, the hesitancy 
around where exactly to define “lesbi-
anism” or “queer womanhood,” and the 
uncertainty around whether exclusively 
gay social life even needs its own space 
on such a strongly queer campus, all 
seem to lead people to pause before they 
send out an invitation to a naked party 
in the Women’s Center. I say, there’s 
value in taking the extra, deliberate 
effort: to carve out a semesterly space, 
to reach queer women beyond your 
social group, to confront the contradic-
tions of a lesbian night out. Let the gays 
dance on. ∎
