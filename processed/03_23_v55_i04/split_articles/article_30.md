“It was the gay community 
wanting to worship with itself,” 
Theriault explained.
“It’s so strange to me that this is the same text that’s used 
against gay people,” said Rev. Ali Donohue, chaplain at the ECY 
and a lesbian. “It’s so clear to me how much of this message is 
helpful, and familiar, and home.”

Creating Space
As older churchgoers were quick to remind me, to 
come out as queer even as little as fifty years ago could result 
in anything from forced exile to social isolation in any given 
church, depending on its denomination.
In 1975, Ken Theriault, then a 21-year-old junior at Yale 
College, came out as gay. Theriault had been raised American 
Baptist, “singing in church choir since they had a robe small 
enough for me.” He began studying at the Yale Divinity School, 
hoping to be ordained in the American Baptist Church even 
as it became clearer that he would not be able to serve in their 
ministry because of his sexuality.
Alongside Beverly Lett, a fellow student at the Yale Divinity 
School, Theriault founded a new branch of MCC in New Haven in 
1977. The expansion filled a void, Theriault said, creating a space of 
formal LGBTQ+ religious acceptance in New Haven at a time where 
no churches allowed or affirmed queer worshippers and leaders.
At its first meeting, MCC New Haven met in the small 
upstairs parlor of a local Methodist church. There were about 
fifteen attendees, most of whom had heard about the church 
through word of mouth or the MCC Hartford newsletter, 
Metroline. MCC New Haven also joined with the New Haven 
chapters of Integrity and Dignity—an Episcopalian and a 
Catholic gay religious group, respectively—for monthly pot-
lucks at members’ homes.
From 1977 to 2015, MCC New Haven moved across several 
churches and hosted anywhere between twenty and one hun-
dred congregants a week.
“It was a real church. Just the population was a little different,” 
Theriault told me. “A place to gather and sing and hear sermons, I 
mean it was a regular church service. We weren’t playing church.”
Theriault found that even though local churches weren’t 
openly affirming of queer people yet, they accommodated 
Theriault and Lett’s requests to meet in their space, often for free.
“It was the gay community wanting to worship with itself,” 
Theriault explained. “Just the fact that there were three congrega-
tions that were willing to house us, and saw that as important as 
part of their mission—there was some acceptance there.”
The church advertised through word of mouth, as well 
as what Theriault called a “bar ministry,” in which members 
recruited patrons of local gay bars like Partners Cafe and passed 
out leaflets advertising the church. Later, the church accrued 
more formal local coverage, including a 1979 profile of Theriault 
in the New Haven Register entitled “New Haven Church Offers 
Sanctuary for Homosexuals.”
“I would say most of us came with some negative experience, 
and that’s why we’re looking for something else,” Theriault told 
me, forty-four years later. “People still have their spirituality and 
want to express it somehow.”
Participation at MCC New Haven eventually dwindled. 
Co-founder Lett left in 1979, and the church struggled to hold 
down a permanent location or pastor. As more of New Haven’s 
churches became accepting of queer worshippers in the early 
2000s, the need for a specifically queer church diminished, and 
social schisms proliferated within the MCC. Today, there are no 
gatherings of MCC in New Haven—parishioners can join the 
MCC Oasis Zoom group or travel forty-five minutes to Hartford.
MCC still exists—across the United States and twenty other 
countries—but it faces struggles unique to being a queer church 
amid a broader landscape of declining church membership and 
aging parishioners. A lack of an endowment or the security of 
a historically owned space makes stability nearly impossible, 
explained Sharron Emmons, a member of the Board of the 
Directors at MCC Hartford and a lesbian. She added that the 
historical lack of queer families—and thus the opportunity to 
raise children in queer churches—hurts growth.
“Early on, if you wanted to go to church, [MCC] was the 
church you went to, unless you wanted to be closeted. But as 
different congregations opened up, now you didn’t really need 
an MCC,” said Cathy Vitelli, a lesbian and former member 
of MCC New Haven who moved to an Episcopalian church. 
“You’re more comfortable there. [But] you could find a commu-
nity someplace else.”
