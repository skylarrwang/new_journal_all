**Title: Jennifer’s Body**

The first time I watch Jennifer’s Body I am 
a budding adolescent huddled under my 
comforter during the first few months of the 
pandemic. Stale bedroom air presses into 
my lungs while crumbs brush against my 
unshaven legs. Over the next hour and forty 
minutes I am overcome by an unfamiliar 
zeal as I take in the bright outfits, hilarious 
dialogue, and mid-2000s emo soundtrack 
that plays while Jennifer Check and her best 
friend Needy unconvincingly pretend they 
aren’t in love with each other. The twentieth 
time I watch the movie is on 35mm at The 
Roxy in New York during my first summer 
on my own. I linger at the entrance and 
smile when I realize I can’t spot a single man. 
In fact, I am surrounded by women who 
definitely had a crush on Megan Fox when 
they were 14. And in the velvet enclosure 
of the theater, we are teenagers again. The 
salt and butter of fresh popcorn mingles in 
the still air. We are suspended in a collective 
coming of age. We are filled to the brim 
with the kind of zeal you experience when 
you are finally seen.
