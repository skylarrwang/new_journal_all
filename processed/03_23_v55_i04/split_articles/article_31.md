“As long as queer kids are being raised in this church—and 
they will be—I think it’s better for them to see people like me 
in the pews than to not,” Oesterblad told me. She emphasized 
she does not try to recruit queer people into the Church. Instead, 
she works with others just like her: baptized Catholics trying to 
navigate hostile yet familiar spaces.


While McNulty and Oesterblad are not alone in their iden-
tities, many of the queer people with whom I spoke who were 
raised Catholic ultimately left the denomination for a variety of 
reasons. Some, like ECY’s Rev. Donohue, realized that, despite 
their love of the faith, it would not make room for their mar-
riage or official ordination. Others, like Forino, were unwilling 
to endure homophobia and partial membership due to their 
sexualities.


In New Haven’s affirming churches, some queer churchgoers 
disregard the religious element of church altogether, staying for 
the welcoming community and its benefits for fostering queer 
connections and social justice.


“From a Christianity and believing-in-God point of view, 
there’s none of that there for me, it’s not what works for me,” 
says Emmons, who has spent decades at both MCC New Haven 
and MCC Hartford despite being an atheist.


“But I’ve seen the church save lives. People come to our 
church, broken—older people, especially because it was tougher 
in the past—where they were kicked out of their families, kicked 
out of their churches,” Emmons adds. “Our message is ‘come 
out, come home, and come back.’ Here’s a place where you can 
re-find your God.”


And many queer people are intent on doing just that. I was 
shocked by the number of queer religious people I stumbled 
upon—young and old—in churches at Yale and New Haven. 
At the United Church on the Green alone, I chatted with three 
queer churchgoers out of a crowd of around twenty people.


One of them was Darnel Ray, a middle-aged gay man who 
sat in the pew in front of me and hummed “mmhmm” in agree-
ment throughout the service. Having been raised American 
Baptist, Ray continued to crave Christianity even after his com-
ing out was a source of conflict between him and his parents. 
Years later, in 2019, he saw the pride flag outside of United and 
decided to try it out. He’s since moved to West Haven but still 
commutes about twenty-five minutes for services. He’s uunsure 
if the church closer to where he lives is accepting, and he’s ner-
vous to find out.


From the Altar
As more openly queer individuals join religious commu-
nities, queer leaders face a dilemma: do they spearhead progress 
towards greater acceptance or seek out already affirming spaces? 
Some, like Donohue and Cadwallader, opt for churches that 
have made strides towards inclusion. Others, like Oesterblad 
and McNulty, find that the nature of non-affirming spaces 
thrusts them into leadership roles since their mere presence 
challenges the status quo. This tension between leading change 
and seeking acceptance animates church communities at New 
Haven and Yale.


Donohue noted that she and her wife, who is also an 
Episcopalian reverend, choose local churches that are already 
affirming. But this choice only came after Donohue left the 
Catholic Church, in which she’d been raised and educated for 
decades of her life.


“I experience [queerness and religion] as a source of strength, 
I observe it as a source of pain,” Donohue explained, noting 
the queer students she’s worked with at Yale are often the ones 
struggling the most. “My only hope is that I’m able to have peo-
ple join me where I’m standing, because I see zero conflict.”


At Yale, there are only four explicitly affirming Christian 
groups out of twenty ministries, explains Rev. Jenny Peek, an 
Associate University Chaplain and lesbian. “Explicitly affirm-
ing” here means believing in the full inclusion and affirmation of 
LGBTQ+ people (including celebrating queer marriages and ordi-
nation) and advertising themselves as such. These groups are the 
Episcopal Church at Yale (ECY), the University Church at Yale 
(UCY), LuMin at Yale, and Yale Progressive Christians Students. 
Peek added that the landscape can sometimes be difficult for 
incoming queer students to navigate.


St. Thomas More walks a thin line when dealing with queer 
students as a Catholic university chapel. The church can—and 
does—welcome queer students, but it cannot formally affirm 
“There is definitely still defiance 
of like, I’m not going to let them 
have the Church,” she said, 
referring to homophobic Catholics. 
“They’re going to have to deal 
with my baptized ass as well.”
