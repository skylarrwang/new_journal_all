EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The New Journal was founded in 1967, under the following mission statement: “This university has once again reached that stage in history when people 
are talking about the New Yale, presumably to be distinguished from the Old Yale, which in its own day was presumably considered new. Wishing to 
share in this modernity, we have chosen The New Journal as the name for our publication. Besides, things seemed slow around here.”

Today, The New Journal is published five times during the academic year by The New Journal at Yale, Inc. Two thousand five hundred 
copies of each issue are distributed free to members of the Yale and New Haven community. The New Journal is printed by TCI Press, 
Seekonk, Massachusetts; bookkeeping and billing services are provided by Colman Bookkeeping of New Haven. Office Address: 
P.O. Box 3311, New Haven, CT 06515.
