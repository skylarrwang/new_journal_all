M
y combat boots were still 
flecked with dirt and my for-
est-green fatigues were covered 
in mud and sweat. Somehow, my beret 
sustained its creases despite soaking up 
the bits of camouflage face paint that I 
hadn’t managed to properly wash off. 
The city was dead quiet. It was 3 a.m., 
my phone was out of battery, and I had 
to walk home from the hospital. 

My nineteen-year-old recruit, Bing 
Jie, was hooked up to an IV and probably 
fast asleep. Two months ago at this time, 
he probably would’ve been at home, 
awake maybe, playing video games, 
watching TV. At the time when he first 
enlisted, he told me, he was a profes-
sional League of Legends player. He 
had come fourth in a national competi-
tion the year before. In terms of national 
service, he really wanted to serve in 
the cyber security division. Instead, he 
was tossed into infantry, and he came 
under my charge. Rhabdomyolysis had 
broken down his major muscles. Now, he 
couldn’t walk without excruciating pain 
in both legs. The moment when he had 
collapsed into a messy heap of limbs and 
grass, he couldn’t even call out for help.

While we were in the waiting 
room, Bing Jie’s dad and older brother 
arrived. After a terse conversation with 
me, they sat with him on the other side 
of the room, away from me.  They tried 
their best not to talk to me directly, 
and neither of them used my name. 
I was “sergeant,” a tool of the state’s 
military apparatus.
