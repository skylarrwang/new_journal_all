“Four days a week I was going to church,” Holly Nichols 
told me in the nave of the United Church on the Green. “They 
waited a year and a half to tell me I was going to Hell.”
Nichols has been religious since the age of six or seven, 
when she first attended Lutheran services in Hamden with a 
childhood friend. She described to me how being in church 
continues to give her a peace she cannot find anywhere else. 
Despite her love of God, she has struggled to find a church that 
accepts and affirms her as a lesbian.

About six months before we spoke, Nichols had been 
attending a non-denominational church in North Haven. She’d 
been there for around a year—involved with Bible study, prayer 
group, and services—when she brought her wife to a Sunday 
service. Shortly after, she told me, one of the five church alders 
told her that being married to a woman was a sin and that she 
had to repent. Nichols brushed it off as just one person’s opinion 
rather than that of the church. But she did not bring her wife 
back again.

The next intervention came when Nichols attended 
membership class, hoping to become an official member in 
the church after more than a year of devoted attendance and 
financial support. But before she entered the church, a mem-
ber at the door warned her that she couldn’t become a member 
if she was gay.
“I think I was in denial that they were going to take it as far 
as they did,” Nichols said. “I thought they were just trying to 
make a point, but I didn’t think it would stand in the way of my 
becoming a member or eventually my being able to attend.”

In September 2022, a year and a half into Nichols’ time with 
the church, the congregation staged a third, full-on interven-
tion for her. Four alders—those with long-term experience and 
standing in the church—and two long-standing members sur-
rounded her in a room.
“They went around in a circle and told me why my marriage 
was wrong, why I was going to Hell,” Nichols said, growing qui-
eter. “And that did test me.”

After that final intervention, Nichols decided to leave that 
church. She first took some time away from formal religious 
spaces, instead investing in her personal prayer life, journaling, 
making gratitude lists—even skydiving.
“It’s traumatizing to be told that you’re rejected by God,” 
Nichols said. “It was really hard to feel like it was safe to go back 
to church.”

After a few months, Nichols began seeking a new worship 
community, but found it difficult to locate an affirming church. 
Her search, mainly directed by Google hits, led her to one dead 
end after another, including uninspiring Zoom-only services 
and an empty parking lot where a church had once been.

She started attending the United Church on the Green a 
little over a month before we met. One of her Google searches 
for an “open and affirming” congregation had finally worked.
“Open and affirming” is a designation created by the United 
Church of Christ (UCC)—the national Christian denomina-
tion to which the United Church on the Green belongs—to 
assert the full inclusion of LGBTQ+ congregants in church life. 
The label means not only welcoming queer congregants into the 
church, but also affirming that their lives are not in conflict with 
the Bible’s teachings.

In practice, “open and affirming” churches fall along a spec-
trum; some churches incorporate it as a tenet of their com-
munity philosophy, while others—according to some queer 
churchgoers—appropriate the phrase as a means of drawing in 
new members. UCC is a congregational church, which means it’s 
much less centralized than other Christian denominations like 
Episcopalian, Presbyterian, and Catholic churches. Because of 
this decentralization, each local UCC congregation can deter-
mine its own policies and practices, including whether to adhere 
to suggested national guidelines. This includes approaches to 
queer affirmation. State by state, county by county, each congre-
gation exercises their own discretion around inclusion.

Standing by the light-filled pews at the back of the church, 
Nichols smiled as she told me about bringing her wife to United. 
She hopes to reintegrate church into their lives together.
“It’s a fresh start without that negative nagging, enemy 
voice telling me this is what makes me not good enough or this 
is what separates me from God that they were feeding me at 
the other church,” she said, as she relaxed her fidgeting hands. 
“Here I don’t have that. I have peace.”

Nichols’ experience with homophobia in the Church is 
not unique. Christian spaces and teachings have notoriously

created violent and traumatic experiences for members of the 
LGBTQ+ community—in Connecticut and beyond. But Nichols 
is also not alone in her persistent desire, as a queer person, to 
find a Christian community despite these hostile encounters. For 
the LGBTQ+ members of New Haven and Yale’s religious com-
munity with whom I spoke, creating queer spaces and forging 
new meaning in the church means adapting old traditions and 
reexamining conventional readings of the Bible. Many say their 
queerness and spirituality enrich each other.

To exist as a queer person in a Christian space is to stand up 
against generations of canonized, homophobic dogma. Despite 
newer, affirming interpretations, many church leaders still wea-
ponize the Bible to condemn homosexuality. They often ground 
these attacks in what have become known as the “clobber passages,” 
those most cited to condemn LGBTQ+ people as heretical. Perhaps 
the most overt condemnation appears in Leviticus 18:22: “You 
shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.”

Congregants I spoke with had varying reactions to these 
texts. Some cited other archaic rules in Leviticus—like prohi-
bition of eating shellfish or mixing fabrics in one’s clothes, and 
a decree ordering menstruating women to leave city limits—as 
proof that some homophobic Christians selectively punish queer 
people over those who commit other listed abominations.

Others see the process of interpretation as one that changes 
over time. There are a growing number of theologians who are 
reading the Bible—particularly these “clobber passages”—with 
a new lens that recasts them as condemnation of other sexual 
wrongs, like rape or incest, rather than being overtly homophobic.
“I’m not going to look at it as this perfect document that has 
been delivered to us today, as it exactly was when it was written,” 
Cal Swanson ’25, a co-chair of the Episcopal Church at Yale (ECY) 
who is also queer, told me. “I’m going to look at it as an artifact 
that has been through centuries of interpretations and changes.”

In the face of the Bible’s weaponization, many of the queer 
people I spoke with explained how the text could be reclaimed 
as a powerful tool of love and affirmation. Most told me they 
blamed the misinterpretation of Christian teachings for the 
harm they faced, rather than the tenets of Christianity. Queer 
churchgoers generally hold the fundamental belief that God 
is good, loving, and just—even when church doctrines don’t 
reflect that.
“The greatest harm we have ever done in religion is to 
not say love yourself first, and you are lovable, and loved,” 
Rev. Aaron Miller, a transgender man and a pastor at the 
Metropolitan Community Church (MCC) in Hartford, tells me. 
“That’s the thing I say over and over again because if you’ve 
heard it a million times, I want you to hear it a million from me. 
Because you’ve been lied to.”

Miller was confirmed as a Lutheran and attended Catholic 
Church for nearly a decade with a former partner. He left the 
Catholic Church for a number of years before eventually return-
ing to religion and attending Yale Divinity School, graduating in 
2008 and working in pastoral care at Yale New Haven Hospital. 
Then he started attending and later working at MCC, a denomi-
nation founded in 1968 by a gay ex-Pentecostal minister explic-
itly for queer people to worship together.

At the beginning of our conversation, I told Miller—just as 
I told everyone I spoke to—that I am a lesbian who was raised 
Episcopalian, having grown up seeing sexuality and religion in 
fundamental tension with each other. Like the others, he was 
quick to try to persuade me otherwise.
“You have to really do gymnastics to ignore us in the Bible—
the queer folks in the Bible,” he told me, referencing specific 
passages in the scripture that lend themselves to queer-affirm-
ing interpretations, including what he interprets as same-sex 
romantic relationships and trans representation.

He told me about Jonathan and David, and Ruth and 
Naomi. He described them as the only romantic couples in the 
Bible, both of whom are same-sex. Ruth’s vow to Naomi, he 
said, is even commonly used at straight weddings. He went on 
to explain readings of transgender identity in the text, telling 
the story of Genesis 1:27—“So God created humankind in his 
image, in the image of God he created them; male and female 
he created them”—as connoting not separate beings but the 
fact that we contain the potential for both genders within us, 
embodying spectral identities.

Perhaps the most overt 
condemnation appears in 
Leviticus 18:22: “You shall 
not lie with a male as with a 
woman; it is an abomination.”
