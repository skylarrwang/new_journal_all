an ambitious agenda for what Sappho 
would bring to the “queer ladies’’ of Yale, 
including guerilla art, skillshares, protests, 
“parties and pregaymes,” and—suppos-
edly—naked parties in the Yale Women’s 
Center. The zine was earnest, funny, and 
pro-Beyonce. One full-page spread of 
collages and hand-scrawled slogans 
encouraged readers to “queer up Yale ‘’ in 
any way they knew how. “GET OUT 
THERE! YOU DO YOU!” the caption 
blared over a drawing of a Venus symbol, 
a printed-out picture of the Hulk, and 
an invitation for lesbians everywhere to 
“make friends’’ and “make enemies.”

The zine folded after four issues. The 
idea of “parties and pregaymes” stuck 
around. Though it’s incredibly difficult 
to track down the “official” emergence of 
Sappho parties, in 2014, a Silliman student 
named Zoe heard, through Facebook 
groups and word of mouth, about a 
semesterly party for sapphic people only. 
The series of Sappho parties, which was 
funded entirely by the friend groups of 
juniors who put them on, was “passed 
down” each year to a new friend group 
of queer women deemed sufficiently cool, 
with enough off-campus space to host. 
“Everyone seemed to know about it, but I 
can’t tell you how,” she recalls.

This sense of uncertainty and anonym-
ity, which persisted throughout Sappho’s 
existence, is a kind of double-edged sword: 
these social spaces are at once uncon-
strained by official channels and institu-
tional funding, and difficult to historicize 
or pin down. Of course, “everyone” can 
also never entirely encompass “everyone.” 
Though Sappho invitations were entirely 
open, most knowledge of the parties, like 
in Maia’s day, boiled down to who already 
knew who.

As sophomores, Zoe and her room-
mates were selected to throw next year’s 
Sappho parties, but with few guidelines 
and no funding by the women who came 
before them. With money they had saved 
from campus jobs and donations from 
attendees, they put on a couple success-
ful events where “people were definitely 
there to hook up.” Zoe recalled these 
parties as “more mixed-race and more 
genderfruity” than most other campus 
parties, and found herself encounter-
ing butchness as a possibility she could 
pursue for the first time. Attendees felt 
at ease picking up women in ways they 
didn’t elsewhere on campus—ways Anna 
didn’t at the frat party her first year. The 
next year, Zoe and her friends passed the 
baton to another Silliman friend group. 
She confesses that she has no idea if they 
carried it on.

They did, although some people 
grew frustrated with the slowness of the 
parties’ semesterly format. “I think we 
need more parties to cruise at and have 
sex at,” recent Yale alumnus Mia Arias 
Tsang told me bluntly. She spent most of 
her time on campus surrounded by other 
queer women of color through her work 
at Broad Recognition, a campus feminist 
publication. Though she was already in 
those environments in her day-to-day 
life, she was looking for more explicitly 
sexual and romantic lesbian spaces after-
hours. She remembers her disappoint-
ment at missing a Sappho party in 2017 
where attendees reportedly did body 
shots. Anna both expressed to me that 
although she wasn’t seeking sex at the 
parties, being in multiple monogamous 
relationships through her time at Yale, 
she enjoyed their distinct atmosphere, at 
once both electric and celebratory.


When Mia did attend the fall 2019 
Sappho party in the rugby basement, she 
felt a huge “pressure to fuck” owing to 
how infrequent and unpredictable the
