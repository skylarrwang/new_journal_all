Anna tender was “already very out” 
as bisexual when she came to Yale 
in 2018. Her first week on campus, 
she followed the stream of nervous first 
years to the fraternity houses on High 
Street, towards what seemed to be the 
archetypal college party: red Solo cups, 
a watered-down keg, and unremarkable 
music shaking the sticky walls. As she 
relaxed into the party, she began to dance 
with a girl next to her, letting her hands 
rest easily on her waist. Half-drunk, and 
thinking of very little except enjoying 
the night, Anna kissed her.
“Huge mistake,” she says of the 
public kiss now. A man leaned in and 
asked, leering, “Can I join?” They broke 
apart. Over the next few days, she found 
that the news of the kiss had spread 
through her residential college, without 
her knowledge or consent. People she 
barely knew “freaked out” at the fact 
that Anna, with her long hair and more 
femme style of dress, hadn’t been what 
they expected of her. A carefree moment 
turned into a public dissection of her 
sexuality. “After that,” she says about the 
party, “I was like, ‘Oh, okay. I get it. This 
is not a space for me.’”

She stopped going to frat parties, 
and started befriending more queer 
women: people she met in classes, her 
modern dance group, mutual friends, 
and hookups. Somebody added her to 
an email list for an organization called 
“Sappho,” an informal social group that 
hosted a semesterly party for queer 
women and nonbinary people. They 
promised a night out free from the 
anxiety that Anna felt at frats. Her soph-
omore year, she arrived at a “Euphoria”-
themed party in the basement of the 
women’s rugby team apartment on Elm 
Street. This was no Bud Light-ruled 
rager: attendees adorned themselves 
with glitter, sipping colorful, intricate 
cocktails made by student bartender 
Lauren Lee. She had already started to 
attend “smaller, more intimate” parties 
dominated by queer women, from wine 
nights hosted by girlfriends of friends 
to a set of lingerie parties hosted by an 
all-woman society. But Sappho was the 
largest gathering of queer women she’d 
seen in one space.
At “the Gay Ivy,” where, according 
to a Wall Street Journal article published 
in 1987, at least “one in four” students 
are some kind of gay, lesbian social life 
is hardly an underground niche. But 
over the decades, Yale’s lesbians and 
queer women have wrestled with how 
to carve out a social life that is safe but 
still exciting.


I
n September 1975, a record twelve 
women attended a meeting of the Gay 
Alliance at Yale (GAY), a mostly male dis-
cussion and advocacy group. It was the 
height of the lesbian feminist movement, 
and some young lesbians were grow-
ing frustrated with what they saw as the 
patriarchal focus of gay activism across 
the United States. Four years before, the 
Yale Women’s Center was founded as a 
space for undergraduate women to gather. 
In 1970, the activist Del Martin published 
an essay, “If That’s All There Is” in the 
lesbian review The Ladder, where she con-
demned gay rights organizations as sexist. 
Lesbians—growing doubly frustrated by 
the homophobia they experienced from 
straight women and the marginalization 
within gay spaces—felt they needed a 
space to breathe.

Two lesbian undergraduates, the 
out-and-proud Tara Ayres and a par-
tially anonymous woman identified 
only as “Sarah” by The Yale Daily News, 
formed a Yale-registered sister group to 
GAY known as “Yalesbians.” On a balmy 
September night, twenty lesbians and 
self-identified “straight woman” allies 
met for the first time at the GAY room 
in Hendrie Hall. They adopted the for-
mat of “consciousness-raising circles,” 
open feminist discussions where women 
connected wider political issues to the 
struggles of their everyday lives. The 
organization also co-ran multiple proj-
ects with GAY, including a telephone 
counseling service and a weekly radio 
hour called “Come Out Tonight.”

Yale’s Weekly Bulletin and Calendar 
initially ignored requests to publicize 
Yalesbians’ weekly meetings. After a few 
weeks, they finally responded and began 
to reluctantly spread the word. Through 
word of mouth and print ads, member-
ship grew to about one hundred people. 
As co-founder, Tara noted Yalesbians’ 
membership was a low estimate of the 
true proportion of lesbians on cam-
pus, arguing in a 1977 report to the Yale 
Corporation that the average gay woman 
at Yale “is probably not vocally a lesbian, 
and is afraid to be identified as such.”

On New Year’s Eve in 1976, a fire 
destroyed part of Hendrie Hall, burning 
out the room where Yalesbians and GAY 
met, as well as the headquarters of the 
service frat Alpha Psi Omega. While the 
frat was re-housed almost immediately, 
the administration dodged Ayres’ inqui-
ries about finding a space for Yalesbians 
for over a month. In late February, Tara 
and GAY member Jack Winkler were 
finally able to march up to the Associate 
Dean of Student Affairs’ office to secure 
a new space in Bingham.

Off campus, meanwhile, many les-
bians could still find social and politi-
cal community in the lesbian feminist 
scene in New Haven. “By the end of 
the [1970s],” Yale alum and former 
Yale LGBTQ history professor George 
Chauncey wrote in The Yale Alumni 
Magazine, “New Haven was home to 
an extraordinarily vibrant and complex 
women’s culture and lesbian feminist 
movement: the Feminist Union; femi-
nist bookstores, women’s health centers, 
self-defense classes.” While Yale lesbians 
(and Yalesbians) found political homes 
in New Haven’s more radical feminist 
scene, they often came cleaved closer to 
campus to party.


B
y the late nineteen-seventies 
and early nineteen-eighties, separat-
ism was no longer the word of the day. 
Maia Ettinger, a former official leader 
of Yalesbians, told me that by the nine-
teen-eighties, the gay “scene” was more 
multiracial and cross-gender 
than the “pretty white” nine-
teen-seventies 
separatist 
world.  She moved off-campus 
to 12 Whalley Avenue, where 
she lived with fellow Yale 
gays Judith Rodenbeck, Lisa 
Kennedy, and the late Donald 
Suggs, who later became known 
as a Black gay activist and jour-
nalist during his postgraduate 
life in New York City. While 
Maia was a leader of on-campus 
lesbian life at weekly Yalesbian 
meetings, the household threw 
after-hours parties that brought 
campus gays together on more 
relaxed terms.

Rather than being exclu-
sively lesbian, the household 
“invited everyone cool, which 
was cool with us,” explains 
Maia. Though 
the 
parties 
skewed gay, they allowed proud 
lesbians and straight lefties 
alike to dance to Boy George, 
Annie Lennox, and Prince, who 
were bringing queer aesthetics 
and sensibilities into popu-
lar music for what felt like the 
first time.

Listening to Maia sketch 
out her gay world, I was 
enthralled by the vibrancy of 
her social and political life. I 
also started to wonder how my life would 
have unfolded on the gay campus of 1982. 
I certainly wouldn’t have identified as 
nonbinary the way I do today—Maia 
confirms that while “androgyny” was the 
word of the day, and something many 
campus lesbians pursued, the language 
just “wasn’t available” to identify outside 
of womanhood.

Romantic and sexual relationships 
flourished—most queer women that 
Maia knew had both casual encounters 
and long-term girlfriends. On nights out 
at several gay off-campus apartments, 
open lesbians made out with the girls 
who had attended weekday Yalesbians 
meetings as “straight allies.” The mood 
was both celebratory and anxious, and 
increased visibility came at a cost. In 
1982, Yale’s LGBT Co-operative held the 
first Gay and Lesbian Awareness Days 
(GLAD), which culminated in an on-cam-
pus dance for which the administration 
gave permission. Maia remembers a 
group of football players had overheard 
that a girl they knew, someone they cer-
tainly didn’t think was gay, was attending. 
One athlete stood outside the door, try-
ing to intimidate her, and Maia “just 
hauled off and punched him in the eye.” 
She was proud to see him later that week 
with a black eye. The gays danced on.

Hostility continued to accumulate. 
In February 1984, the senior class threw 
a party at what is now Grace Hopper 
College, where the 17-year-old daughter 
of a Yale faculty member was kicked in 
the stomach by male students. The men 
taunted the girl, and the female friends 
she was dancing with, with chants of 
“Lesbos!” Susan Arkun, a Yale College 
student who was verbally harassed at 
the event, explained to the News that 
in social spaces she was often met with 
derision owing to her short dyed hair. “I 
wish those lesbians would leave so we 
could tap the keg,” she overheard once. 
Strangers shouted “Yalesbians!” at her 
on the street.

Maia freely accepts that in the face 
of these explosions of homophobia, some 
of her football player-punching bravado 
was bluster. She wishes the gay com-
munities on campus had the language 
at the time to articulate “how fright-
ened we actually were.” At 18 or 19, she 
explains, “maybe you access anger more 
easily than you access your own vulner-
ability.” Parties are a good way to deflect 
from the fact that it is often difficult to 
be young and gay and alive.


Y
alesbians faded, let down by a 
quick student body turnover and 
a lack of institutional memory. The 
group’s archives were smaller and more 
informal than a lot of other, larger, offi-
cial student orgs. Leadership changed 
hands, over and over again. By the time 
the third millennium rolled around, 
Yalesbians’ weekly, Wednesday meetings 
had stopped. I combed through campus 
newspaper archives to find some con-
crete reason for the organization’s dis-
solution, but came up with nothing. The 
last mention of the group I could find 
came in 1995, when the News advertised 
a regular Yalesbians meeting as part of 
“Sexuality Awareness Week.”

But lesbians, specifically, still wanted 
a space to come together. Sappho, named 
after the Greek poetess who gave us 
the word “lesbian,” was founded by an 
unknown group of queer women in 
2004. Unlike Yalesbians, who were a 
registered student organization receiv-
ing Yale funding, Sappho began—and 
remained—an informal social collective. 
Sticking true to Yalesbians’ 1979 decla-
ration to “never again turn to the YDN” 
to publicize their work, Sappho in 2010 
started to reach other on-campus queers 
in the most 2010 of ways: a blog.

On sapphoyale.blogspot.com, “queer, 
questioning, lesbian, bi, trans, and 
everything else in between women at 
Yale’’ could post, anonymously or not, 
about anything that came to mind. 
In the style of full-on early 2010s 
hyper-enthusiasm, they gushed about 
their sexual awakenings (“I LOVE 
TOPPING . . . Eeeeee.”), brought gay 
political news to the blogosphere (“Yay, 
queer people can now visit thier [sic] 
partners in hospitals just like married 
people!”), and rejoiced over queer pop 
culture (“how awesome was glee in so 
many ways? way awesome.”) The blog 
encompassed the complexities of les-
bian social life in the emerging digital 
age. On the one hand, queer women on 
campus could now stay connected to 
each other at all times, even in physi-
cal isolation. Dozens of posts popped 
up over summer and winter breaks, 
lamenting homophobic households and 
celebrating hometown pride parades. 
But in some ways, with the arrival of 
the internet, lesbian spaces were also in 
the process of becoming more isolated, 
more dispersed. Websites like Tumblr, 
which flourished in the early 2010s, 
allowed younger queer people to “come 
out” under digital aliases, while remain-
ing closeted in their day-to-day life, not 
taking the risk (and thrill) of venturing 
into physical queer spaces. Lesbians 
could raise their consciousness from the 
comfort of their home, without looking 
another queer in the eye.

The blog only lasted a year before 
being replaced in September 2012 by a 
series of zines called “Hey Girl!” Perhaps 
Sappho’s new leadership, tiring of the 
dispersed nature of the digital, wanted 
to throw it back to the heyday of ana-
log feminism. The DIY-style zines, fre-
quently thrown together over the span 
of one night, were a deliberate aesthetic 
homage to the anarchist, punk, and Riot 
Grrrl subcultures of the nineteen-eight-
ies and nineteen-nineties. They set out
