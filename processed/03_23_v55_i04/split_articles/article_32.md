them in their ability to live out their queerness, particularly in sex-
ual relationships. This would be a violation of Catholic teachings.
Oesterblad recalls being thrust into a leadership role for the 
LGBTQ+ Ministry at STM—a ministry affinity group founded 
during the pandemic—as one of the few openly queer people 
in the church. Laughing, she remembers wishing she could join 
an already existing space: “Can I just plug into something that 
already exists and be ministered too, please?” Oesterblad ended 
up helping to create, design, and lead the ministry.

In the midst of this landscape, queer chaplains at Yale can 
offer a beacon of representation and affirmation. “Knowing 
that she’s queer and she has this amazing understanding of the 
Bible being about love and being about affirming your LGBTQ 
identities is so helpful for me,” Swanson said of Donohue, who 
leads his church. “I feel like I absorb some of my certainty 
about it from her. And so I think it’s been a big thing having a  
queer chaplain.”

Outside of Yale’s walls, queer reverends often engage in the 
same kind of affirmative work, though for a much broader audi-
ence—not just young adults. But the pastors I spoke with noted 
that the churches that call these queer leaders are often already 
accepting and progressive.

Rev. Cadwallader of the First Presbyterian Church 
recounted a time that a congregation offered her a job with the 
disclosure that about half of the congregation was not ready for 
a queer pastor. The hiring committee hoped she could change 
their minds. She ultimately turned them down: “I’m not in the 
business of splitting churches . . . That journey needs to be done 
by somebody else.”

But not every queer member of non-affirming spaces feel 
that they have a choice.

“I’ve often been the one who starts conversations,” McNulty 
said of his work at the STM’s LGBTQ+ Ministry. “And I’m okay 
with that.” He starts these conversations with a contradiction 
he says he incurs “by virtue of existing”: being a gay Catholic.

Ultimately, queer religious leaders across New Haven can 
usher in a more accepting space, buttressed by the virtue of rep-
resentation. Cadwallader says her queerness is a strength when 
she preaches to all her congregants—even those who aren’t queer.

“I get to remind them again about who Jesus is in their lives 
and why Jesus is important,” Cadwallader said. “And they tend 
to listen to me because I am the voice of the one that was told for 
so long that I shouldn’t be there.”

“Do you have a church home?” Nichols asked me when 
we first met in the nave of United. She echoed the common 
language of many that I spoke with—a church where I could 
belong, be affirmed, and return to, no matter where I was in life.

I told her how I had grown up in the Episcopalian Church, 
but now I was more of a Christmas and Easter Christian. I wor-
ried I’d stopped believing too soon, and I didn’t know if there 
was a future path for me.

After we finish talking, I thank her for opening up about her 
story. She looks at me, holding eye contact as I close my note-
book. I have a strange feeling, like I’m about to cry.

“I hope this project opens your eyes to whatever it is you 
need to see,” Nichols says. “I hope you find whatever it is you’re 
searching for.”

I think I’m starting to see. Perhaps more than queer peo-
ple seeking and finding religion, I’ve found them reclaiming it—
coming home. ∎
