chain of correspondence, she would send 
the concerned parent Tony’s contact info. 
“He is the connector who holds the com-
munity together,” she wrote in one email. 
This elaborate network of referrals 
makes it difficult to trace the origins of 
Tony’s group—only Tony himself can 
explain how it began.


hen I arrived five minutes early  
 to scout out a table for my meeting 
with Tony, I found him already there, sit-
ting by the window. He was the same as 
I remembered him, beard combed into a 
triangular point, arms covered in a sleeve 
of tattoos that featured, in black lettering 
on his right arm, the phrase ‘CREATE 
YOURSELF.’ I, on the other hand, was 
ten inches taller and six years into hor-
mone replacement therapy. He looked 
up with a smile, exclaiming, “You’ve 
gotten older!”


When Tony started the group, he 
explained, it was easier to find. He 
announced the proposed meeting times 
and distributed fliers at True Colors, the 
annual LGBTq+ youth conference hosted 
on the University of Connecticut Storrs 
campus. At Tony’s first class, only two 
kids showed up. “One of them, Angel, 
did the same thing you always did,” 
Tony laughed, recalling my outfit swaps. 
“She went to the bathroom and changed 
into what she wanted to wear. And 
that’s when I knew that this could really 
be space to feel comfortable in your skin, 
create, and be yourself.”


Before 2011, when “gender iden-
tity or expression” was added to 
Connecticut’s list of legally protected 
categories, there was no requirement 
that schools respect the identities or

needs of gender-nonconforming and 
trans students. And it wasn’t until 2015 
that Yale Health’s Gender Program, a 
centralized source for trans healthcare 
in New Haven, was established. Facing 
a lack of social and medical resources, 
many families with trans or gender 
non-conforming children turned to 
Tony for his familiarity with these 
issues, and ended up attending his sup-
port group.


Even nonprofits and medical ser-
vices that were nominally offering 
support for queer youth began to refer 
their patients to Tony, unsure of how to 
help them navigate other parts of the 
bureaucracy.  “Pretty soon organizations 
all around Connecticut were contact-
ing me,” Tony said. He would receive 
open-ended requests from overwhelmed 
therapists and doctors, who knew him 
from his public speaking and nonprofit 
involvement: “We have a seven-year-old, 
we have a nine-year-old, we don’t know 
what to do,” Tony recalled them saying. 
“Can you help?”


The group quickly grew from there. 
Now, Tony finds publicizing the group 
unnecessary. He explained that peo-
ple just know about him, as we had, 
through the natural social fabric of 
the LGBTQ+ community. “I always get 
emails that say stuff, like, ‘a friend of a 
friend knows a parent that goes to your 
group,’” described Tony. “Barely anyone 
knows my last name. People just say—
oh, there’s this guy, you know Tony—oh 
yeah, I know Tony!”


ony’s strength lies in his abil-
ity to simultaneously offer practical 
and emotional support. When families 
ask for advice about legal or medical 
services, he is already familiar with the 
specific laws and systems that govern 
Connecticut. When a child is unsure 
about how to express themselves in 
words, he sits with them and has them 
draw pictures. And when he needs to 
help a hesitant parent come around to 
accepting their child, he meets them 
where they are. 


Tony described one recent interac-
tion on the phone with the father of a 
child who had come out as trans: “He 
was dropping the F bomb, cursing his 
kid out. I said, well, is there any self-
harm or any suicidal ideations going 
on with the kid? ‘Oh yeah. He tried to 
kill himself three times.’ So I said, let 
me ask you a quick question. Do you 
want to accept your son or mourn your 
daughter? Because there is a likelihood 
of you standing in front of that grave 
saying, shit, I should have called you Chris 
this whole time.”


Tony has seen these stories, all-too-
common in the trans community, play 
out around him; he has witnessed first-
hand the effects of children feeling alone. 
“A few years ago, I was visiting a psych 
hospital to see a kid . . . When he saw me, 
he smiled so big. To me, it felt like at 
that moment in my life, I was respon-
sible for all these lives.” The burden 
of providing a child with the love and 
acceptance that their parents had with-
held left Tony physically incapacitated. 
“My blood pressure went sky high. I had 
to go to the emergency room.” Tony 
took a yearlong break from life coaching 
after this incident.


community, it is these relationships 
Tony crafts and facilitates that most 
powerfully transform the lives of those 
around him. “That’s what I’m here for,” 
he told me. “I’m here to talk it out.” 


When I was around nine, I asked 
Tony to start having one-on-one meet-
ings. I had started to become aware of 
an identity being forced upon me that 
felt deeply wrong. During music and 
gym time, we were now split into “boy” 
and “girl” groups; in Spanish class, my 
grammar started to be corrected when 
I resisted using the masculine ending -o 
to describe myself. Amidst these curric-
ular shifts, I grappled with the fact that 
my body was soon going to change in 
ways I wasn’t sure I could deal with. But 
I lacked the words to describe exactly 
what it was I wanted to say. 


Tony and I would meet every 
month or so, on weekday evenings in his 
Hamden apartment. The walls of his liv-
ing room were decorated with his own 
art—abstract and tactile, loose brush-
work and dripping colors. It was here 
in this private space, sketchpad in hand, 
that I first articulated through drawing 
that I was transgender. When I didn’t 
want to talk it out, Tony and I would 
draw it out. ∎

On June 10th at 6:30, at North 
Branford High School, his alma mater, 
there will be a tenth-anniversary 
screening of the documentary A Self-
Made Man, a film by Lori Petchers 
about Tony’s life and his work with 
transgender and nonbinary youth and 
their families The event will bene-
fit Q+, a queer youth organization 
in Hartford, tv-365, a non-profit 
organization serving the transgender 
community, and North Branford 
High Schools Diversity Group.


Helping a child navigate their own 
gender identity thus requires a complex 
combination of buy-in and detachment 
from parents. “I don’t think people real-
ize this enough with kids,” Tony pos-
ited, “but no one knows who they are 
better than they do. I tell parents all 
the time, allow your child to walk their 
journey. You just protect them. They 
know who they are.” 


Tony described the types of lan-
guage he frequently uses with hesitant 
parents. “I’m not trying to talk you into 
anything. The only thing I’m trying to 
do, because of the love you have for your 
child, is make sure you have a good rela-
tionship with them, support them.” 


Beyond the myriad of concrete ways 
he contributes to Connecticut’s LGBTQ+
