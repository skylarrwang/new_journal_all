EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
n carefully-labeled boxes 
in her study, my mother preserves 
my childhood drawings, school-
work, and journals. Early attempts at 
academic writing sit inside the Hannah: 
2015-2016 bin (“You may just think of 
Susan B. Anthony as the woman on 
the silver dollar coin, but she was much 
more than that”). Hannah: 2013 holds a 
hand-drawn comic book based on the 
Clue board game. The boxes before that, 
dating back to before my transition—all 
labeled with my birth name—include 
an evolving set of colorful self-portraits. 
Each drawing was an attempt to com-
municate who I was to the world. Each 
was crafted in Tony Ferraiolo’s Saturday 
morning drawing group.

Every other weekend starting at 
age six, I would walk into the location 
of Tony’s drawing group in my school 
clothes. Solemnly, I’d change in the 
bathroom into whatever feminine out-
fit I had most recently bought from a 
secondhand store in Hamden. Sitting 
around a table covered with scraps of 
printer paper and loose magic markers, 
I’d make art with a group of other gender- 
nonconforming kids from around the 
greater New Haven area. Tony would 
give us instructions: “How many of you 
have been sad about how you relate to 
your body? Draw it.” 

As a kid, I just knew him as the 
bowler-hat 
wearing, 
tattoo-covered 
guy who ran my loosely-defined art 
class. But Tony wears many other hats: 
founder of the Jim Collins Foundation, 
which provides funding to trans people 
across America for gender-affirming 
surgeries; director of the youth and fam-
ily program for Healthcare Advocate 
International, a Hartford-based educa-
tional and medical organization; guest 
speaker at countless corporations and 
groups across Connecticut—a self-des-
cribed “professional trans person.”

When I began attending Tony’s 
classes, I never really wondered how or 
why the program started; I took it for 
granted that resources like these were 
available to me. But Tony founded 
the group in 2008, only a year before 
I joined. What he offers is a compre-
hensive but casual program that allows 
children to express themselves creatively, 
and, through a simultaneous parent 
group, provide practical and emotional 
advice. Through this twofold structure, 
Tony helps families make sense of their 
role in their child’s gender journey.

The group evades bureaucratic cat-
egorization; it is not housed under any 
umbrella nonprofit, and there is no 
official name. He even avoids describ-
ing the group as his own: “I knew 
from the beginning that these are not 
‘my’ groups, but the members’ groups,” 
Tony explained to me over email. “We 
don’t have an agenda or a certain sub-
ject that the members have to talk about. 
The support groups are free flowing.” 
Members can choose the creative activ-
ity that they do on a given day, and are 
free to direct the conversation in which-
ever direction they please.
gender-nonconforming youth and their 
parents.

A lack of conventional publicity 
has not prevented Tony’s group from 
expanding, however. Fifteen years after 
its founding, the program is thriving, 
with dozens of kids and families attend-
ing each week. When I started attend-
ing as a first-grader, I was one of the 
youngest, shyly watching the teenagers 
joke around in the room next door; now, 
there are facilitators and ‘junior facil-
itators’ (past members who have aged 
out of the program and want to remain 
involved) who help Tony manage the 
larger number of kids. He has split the 
group into three simultaneous sessions 
with different activities based on age: 
drawing time for those under nine, and 
discussion groups for pre-teens (ten to 
twelve) and teenagers (thirteen to eigh-
teen). For the last hour of each session, 
everyone joins together to play board 
games and socialize.

This independence from a larger 
institution is part of what has allowed 
Tony’s classes to continue for so long; 
activities hosted by the New Haven 
Pride Center, for example, have been 
hampered since the nonprofit lost its 
501(c)(3) status for a few months this 
year after failing to file tax returns. 
Tony’s group, on the other hand, does 
not rely directly on institutional support; 
he offers the Saturday morning meet-
ings pro bono, paying for the craft sup-
plies out-of-pocket. Locations in and 
around New Haven allow him to use 
their spaces at no expense for him or the 
families who attend.

During the years when I was a 
member of Tony’s class, we bounced 
around between three locations. Since 
then, the group has settled down in one 
place. Tony keeps the meeting location 
private, he told me when we met in a 
cafe one February morning, to pro-
tect the members of the group. “We 
have people who hate us.”

hen I asked my mom 
how we first learned about 
Tony’s group, she described a 
convoluted chain of contacts. 
Since my kindergarten days, 
we had been part of a series 
of informal groups focused 
on gender-nonconform-
ing children: a mailing 
list for parents to share 
resources (known by 
its subscribers simply 
as ‘The Listserv’); a group in New York 
City that we attended a couple of times 
during my second grade year; an annual 
summer family gathering known as 
Camp I Am. One early liaison from 
these networks was Edgardo Menvielle, 
a Psychiatrist at the Children’s National 
Medical Center in Washington, D.C., 
who put us in touch with a local contact 
who in turn connected us with Tony. 
Others seem to have found out 
about Tony’s group through similarly 
convoluted means. As I started working 
on this article, my mother forwarded me 
a few of the emails she had received over 
the last decade from parents of gen-
der-nonconforming youth. Searching 
through the archives of her inbox, scru-
pulously sorted just like my childhood 
artwork, my mom had located doz-
ens of email chains with parents from 
around Connecticut. Some had gotten 
her contact information from mutual 
friends; others knew to reach out to her 
because they had received an email sent 
to my whole elementary school when I 
transitioned; still others were referred 
to her by local clergy or physicians who 
had worked with our family. The parents 
who reached out to her seemed unable 
to find these resources on their own; 
one 2016 email sent to my mom from 
a parent of a student at my elemen-
tary school read, “Do you know of any 
social support groups for preteens? I’ve 
reached out to a couple LGBT groups 
and haven’t heard back. We are trying 
to find anything near New Haven that 
would be welcoming.” A similar email 
came from a member of our synagogue; 
another was from a professor who had 
just moved to town. At the end of each
