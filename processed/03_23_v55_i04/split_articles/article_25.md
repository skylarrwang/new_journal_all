BEGINNINGS
On the night of August 17th, 2022, 
Dr. Christy Olezeski received a Twitter 
notification. Then another, and another. 
She was on vacation with her family, taking 
a break from New Haven and the pressures 
of her work as Director of the Yale Pediatric 
Gender Program (YPGP). She hadn’t even 
brought her work laptop with her—her goal 
was to unplug. But, as the Twitter notifica-
tions streamed in, she realized something was 
wrong. The world had found her.
Dr. Olezeski, affectionately known by her 
patients as just Dr. Christy, knew it was only 
a matter of time. Right-wing activists had 
launched threats targeting Boston Children’s 
Hospital earlier that same month, and the 
year’s legislative sessions had seen a slate of 
anti-trans bills passed in Texas, Alabama, and 
Idaho. Dr. Olezeski hadn’t been deterred—
but when she saw that Libs of TikTok, a 
right-wing Twitter account with over a mil-
lion followers, had reposted a video of her 
from the YPGP’s website, she knew the YPGP 
was in danger.
“I give it twenty-four hours before I get 
my first death threat,” she thought to herself. 
The next morning, Dr. Olezeski woke up to 
four emails she described as “quite unpleas-
ant.” Within two days, the story was picked 
up by international conservative media outlets 
including Fox News, the New York Post, and 
the Daily Mail. “Yale professor blasted for pro-
gram working with 3-year-olds on their ‘gen-
der journey,’” read Fox News’ headline. More 
emails streamed in, and phone calls and let-
ters began arriving at the clinic. Some of Dr. 
Olezeski’s harassers even found her home 
address, sending letters directly to her house. 
Dr. Olezeski was the face of the YPGP, and so far-right media 
outlets and influencers like Libs of TikTok descended on her 
as an emblem of “gender ideology,” a term used in transpho-
bic politics which presents the existence of trans people as a 
threat to society. In total, she and the clinic received hundreds 
of threats. 
As Dr. Olezeski sat in one of the clinic’s sterile conference 
rooms, recounting the harassment on a cloudy afternoon last 
February, she took a deep breath. Then she took another, and 
then another. And, finally, she began to cry. Dr. Anisha Patel, 
one of the co-founders of the YPGP alongside Dr. Olezeski, 
hugged her. “We’re huggers here at the clinic,” Dr. Patel 
affirmed. Dr. Patel sat back down, but Dr. Olezeski began to 
cry again, so Dr. Patel returned for another hug and continued 
to sit by Christy’s side. The two took a moment to collect them-
selves, and then Dr. Patel emphasized that, after the threats, 
“the support came from the team. We were always pretty close, 
but now we’re like a little family.” 
The Yale Pediatric Gender Program started with an email. 
In 2014, Dr. Olezeski was working in the Department of 
Psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine (YSM). After speak-
ing with trans community leaders in New Haven about the 
needs of the trans kids they worked with, Dr. Olezeski emailed 
the Department of Endocrinology to ask who was providing 
healthcare to trans youth. The response was concerning: Yale 
had no such program. Luckily, there were other interested 
doctors in the pediatric endocrinology department at YSM, 
including Dr. Patel. 
Prior to 2014, Dr. Patel had the occasional trans patient 
but lacked the infrastructure to do anything but refer them to 
hospitals in Boston and Hartford. One patient of hers lacked 
the resources to make it to either city. “I don’t have anywhere 
to go,” she remembers the patient telling her. “You’re my doctor, 
and I want you to do this for me.” Dr. Patel looked him in the 
face and made a promise: “I will figure this out.” 
With the addition of Dr. Susan Boulware and Dr. Stuart 
Weinzimer, both pediatric endocrinologists at Yale, the 
Pediatric Gender Program team officially numbered four. But 
before they could open their doors, they had to research. The 
team contacted academic pediatric gender centers across the
