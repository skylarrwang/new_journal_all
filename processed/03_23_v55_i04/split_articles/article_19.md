queer lives. These often anonymous communities 
were essential to an entire generation of gay men; 
these bars were one of the few places they could 
gather. Outside the normative hours, into the night-
time, one could experience their first sexual encoun-
ters with other queer people in the liminality of the 
gay bar. With little barriers to self-expression, the 
gay bar becomes a place of genesis. Unique queer 
aesthetics were born: leather and kink sub-cultures, 
drag personas, cruising codes, creations a heteronor-
mative society might find abnormal. Bernard puts it 
in a simpler way.
“For me, it was just liberating to come to a gay bar. 
I knew I was gay, always. But it wasn’t talked about 
until I came here.” he says. “You see your gay friends. 
It’s gay community so it’s fun, you know?”
Bernard tells me that Partners was founded in 
1974 by Jack Garity and two friends, who ran the 
bar for fifteen years before handing it off to Dave. 
Almost fifty years later, the bar is still open. It had 
survived the peak of the epidemic and the twen-
ty-first century decline of gay bars nationwide. In 
March 2020, the bar closed due to the coronavirus 
pandemic. The face-to-face intimacy that the bar 
provided for the queer community momentarily dis-
appeared. Nevertheless, once Bernard and Dave got 
state approval, they opened their doors again in May 
2021. People flooded the bar and lined up out the 
door, clamoring to get inside and dance. In a time 
in which businesses were closing left and right, the 
community showed out for Partners.
Perhaps Partners is one of the lucky ones. The 
years between 2007 and 2019 saw a closure of 37 per-
cent of gay bars across the United States and the 
pandemic ensured the closure of even more. More 
dire, around 200 lesbian bars have closed since 
the 1980s, leaving twenty-seven lesbian bars in the 
nation today according to the Lesbian Bar Project. 
There have been numerous theories to explain this 
sudden uptick in closures. Some blame dating 
apps like Grindr or Scruff that have replaced the 
gay bar’s person-to-person model. Some blame an 
exhaustion among gay consumers, resulting from 
the extensive marketing of spaces and products as 
“gay” or “queer.” But others seem to hint toward a 
changing of attitudes within the LGBTQ+ commu-
nity. Namely, that with a new generation marked by 
queer acceptance, the need for specific gay spaces as 
safe spaces is diminishing. In the context of the gay 
bar, acceptance almost seems like a contradictory 
phenomenon.
“There will always be the same need for gay peo-
ple: love and acceptance,” Bernard tells me. “And 
we’ll provide that here. Because you can make a fool 
of yourself here. You can go to another place that 
accepts gay people but you need a safe space. You 
know that you are different and you always need a 
place to see your friends.”
He holds his hands up: “This is it.”
In my head, I repeat love and acceptance. I decide 
to take him for his word.


n between interviews, I stop by the New 
Haven Pride Center. Inside, I meet Juancarlos 
Soto, the interim director of the center. When I enter, 
he has just gotten off the phone. After we talk, we 
find out both of our fathers are pastors. I laugh at 
this coincidence. We sit in a room covered with rain-
bow flags. On the wall beside us, there is a mural of 
men dancing. Queer history books line the book-
shelf next to him. The room is warmly lit by a lamp, 
illuminating his face. We’re sitting in a chapel of 
queer paraphernalia.
“I think sometimes we can create harm when we 
call something a safe space, because the reality is vio-
lence still happens, even within our own community. 
I still interact with queer spaces that don’t feel safe,” 
Juancarlos says. “Unfortunately, the same things we 
were fighting fifty years ago are still the same things 
we’re fighting today. In terms of how anti-trans folks 
are describing trans individuals and non-binary folks, 
it’s really the same playbook that we were using in 
the eighties. It’s just we swapped around terms.” 
When Juancarlos describes “safe” queer spaces, 
such as the Pride Center or New Haven’s gay bars, 
he likes to call them “brave” spaces. It is an acknowl-
edgement—though aspects of safety have arrived 
with acceptance, in Juancarlos’ eyes, acceptance has 
not fully arrived. And if safety cannot truly be guar-
anteed, why offer a false promise? Any queer space 
demands the bravery of queer people to exist.
It feels strange to assume acceptance has arrived. 
Less than halfway through 2023, the United States 
has seen more anti-LGBTQ bills than the past five 
years combined. These bills have included a wide 
range of attacks, from bans on gender-affirming care 
and drag shows to the discontinuation of LGBTQ 
education in schools. Last year saw the murders of at 
least thirty-eight transgender people in the United 
States according to the Human Rights Campaign. 
And memories of Colorado Springs, where a 2022 
shooting at a gay club left five dead and seventeen 
wounded, are still fresh on the minds of many gay 
club-goers. Yet, though queer violence continues to 
persist, Juancarlos and I both agree that the queer 
community has changed dramatically.
“The ways the HIV epidemic and guilt have 
marked older generations compared to how its 
marked younger generations are very different, right? 
Because of how much more we know around preven-
tion and how fewer deaths we have now in compar-
ison, when you talk to younger generations, the way 
you talk about the virus is almost flippant in younger 
generations compared to older adults,” Juancarlos 
says. “I think all of those things create differences in 
their experiences and the issues that they face. But 
I think if we pause and talk to each other, we may 
realize that they’re more like the same things that we 
were fighting.”
He’s right. Scrolling through TikTok, I come 
across influencers like Zach Willmore, who has 
been vlogging his life since his positive HIV test 
results. The videos are mundane. In some, he pow-
ders his face with makeup while talking about his 
medication treatment. In others, he shops for shoes. 
It feels strange to assume 
acceptance has arrived. Less 
than halfway through 2023, 
the United States has seen 
more anti-LGBTQ bills than 
the past five years combined.

The end result, even on an interface like TikTok, is 
revolutionary—HIV is no longer seen as a death sen-
tence. But with this cultural shift, a strange dilemma 
arises: is normalization synonymous with forgetting? 
Juancarlos celebrates these generational changes. At 
the same time, he still seems concerned, unconvinced. 
We are still fighting the same things.
“The movement sort of went dormant and silent. 
We were like, ‘Oh, we have gay marriage. We have 
a president on TV talking about his evolution on 
same sex marriage. We don’t have to worry about 
high risk infections of HIV.’ Mind you. Black and 
brown, specifically, black trans women, were getting 
murdered at incredible rates,” he says. “Honestly, the 
LGBTQ community sort of got complacent. It feels 
like we are going backwards these days.”


street over from Partners, another gay bar 
called 168 York Street Cafe hides in the basement 
of a brick townhouse. Its windows are shy, peeking 
just barely above ground level. From the outside, I 
don’t notice too much. Maybe the movement of a 
dim shadow. And a faint Whitney Houston melody. 
When the night falls, loneliness calls . . .
When I enter, I hear the disco of the seven-
ties, the divas of the eighties—Whitney Houston, 
Cyndi Lauper, Donna Summer. It’s a far cry from 
the glitzy dance-pop that had reverberated from 
Partners’ speakers. Nobody here dances. There is no 
need to. 168 York is a pub, not a nightclub. Instead of 
movement, there is the warm clamor of voices. The 
handful of patrons all seem familiar with one another, 
sitting on the long counter, talking over each other, 
laughing. Once in a while, a man walks in and the 
noise crescendos. People look up, nod, hug, say hello, 
then goodbye. Amidst the noise, Joey Goodwin, the 
owner of the bar, sits at the very end of the counter, a 
seat usually reserved for him. I sit next to him.
“Look at this handsome gentleman interviewing 
me,” Joey tells a leaving friend. “Oh, who am I kid-
ding. You look old enough to be my grandson.”
I laugh. It’s true. I am the youngest in the 
room by many years. As I sit next to Joey, I real-
ize I have never in my life been surrounded by 
older gay men. Age, I realize, is a strange privilege. 
For an older generation of gay men, lives seemed 
quickly lived. In a way, escaping youth was an odd 
accomplishment. Here, all these men sit laughing, 
in a future they have created for themselves. The 
wooden walls—a worn brown—testify to the bar’s 
age. The floor’s faded planks creak at certain steps. 
Joey used to sand the floors when he needed to 
deep clean. Now, after so many years, he can’t sand 
them down anymore without their nails breaking 
loose. Between the previous owners and Joey, 168 
York has existed in some form for about sixty years, 
making it Partners’ senior. The bar, like Partners, 
has stood through the heights of the AIDS epidemic 
and COVID-19, as well as a fire that burned down its 
old location in 1978. 
Joey talks about the levels of caution that used to 
exist for gay bars. He tells me bar-goers would park 
streets away from the bar and wear reflective jack-
ets to obscure their identities as they entered and left. 
Anonymity was synonymous with nightlife. 
“You had nicknames when you were going out, 
you know. People said ‘Call me Charlie, call me this, 
call me that,’ So everyone had names until you’re 
going back to the pub again and all of a sudden 
Charlie didn’t show up,” he says. “Then you found 
out that Charlie wasn’t his real name. And then you 
found out that if you didn’t see him in six months, 
you were sure he passed away.”
He quickly says goodbye to a departing friend. 
Turning back, he takes a sip of his drink. 
“People who were different came to a gay bar 
because there was no place else to go. Gay bars were 
shelters for them,” Joey says. “You wouldn’t see too 
many straight people in the gay bar back then. They 
were homophobic. We lived undergroundpurposely.”
Joey sees more straight people entering 168 York 
now. This isn’t anything that bothers him. In fact, he 
finds it humorous. He describes how a straight man 
will walk in, bypass the rainbow flags hanging above 
the drinks, the trans pride colors on the refrigerator, 
the drag show advertisements on the walls, and sit 
down for a drink. As more of the regulars walk in, 
the man will slowly realize where he is. Joey describes 
the man’s sudden nervousness when he asks the bar-
tender if 168 York is a gay bar.
“I love it. It just entertains me the most. I’m say-
ing to myself ‘God, I hope so-and-so doesn’t come 
in. They’re going to give the whole thing away!’” Joey 
says, laughing.
“Do you think the gay bar should in some way be 
gate-kept?” I ask. “As in just for gay people?”
Joey shakes his head. “No. I always wanted to be 
an educator. Being a bar owner, you have a responsi-
bility to say this is unacceptable, this is acceptable.” he 
says. “I thought the only way that I would ever fulfill 
that dream was to have people come in here and let 
them know that we’re not as bad as they think.”
How Joey sees it, gay bars are used as a kind of 
guided discovery. By having straight people confront 
queerness in the gay bar, the fear regarding sexual-
ity becomes obscured and ideally, leads to an obvious 
reckoning—that queer people, at their foundation, 
are human too. In the gay bar, the straight man 
becomes othered by his straightness. Sexuality is not 
defined by its relation to heterosexuality. It is defined, 
for once, in the context of queerness.
“Are people trying to start new gay bars these 
days?” I ask.
“I don’t see anyone waiting in line to open up a 
gay bar, that I can tell you,” he says. “They don’t want 
any more duplications of a gay bar anymore, because 
everything’s so diluted now. Most people don’t have 
to go to a gay bar anymore.”
“Do you think at one point . . . ” I start to say.
He interrupts me, already knowing my question. 
“Your question is, okay. There was a need for a gay bar 
but because of cultural changes, you’re thinking how 
long I can stay in the game for.”
I nod. He looks back at me knowingly. In the 
background, there is an eruption of laughter. Someone,
