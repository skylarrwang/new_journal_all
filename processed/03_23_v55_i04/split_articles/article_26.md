Waiting for Care
country, discussing policies and procedures. The four doctors 
met monthly for a year to assemble their team. They recruited 
endocrinologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, an OB­/­GYN, an 
ethicist, and a lawyer. Every team member worked on a vol-
unteer basis. 
“We knew it was going to take a long time to go through 
the regular channels at Yale,” Dr. Olezeski said. But trans kids 
were in desperate need of care, and they had nowhere to go in 
New Haven. The team decided on a work-around: one half-
day a month, the three endocrinologists would take on gender 
patients instead of their general endocrine schedule. The clinic 
officially started taking patients in October 2015. “There was 
no ribbon cutting,” Dr. Christy laughed. “It was all word of 
mouth in the beginning.” 
But word of mouth traveled fast: wait times had ballooned 
to eight months by 2017. Soon after, wait times were mea-
sured in years. The team petitioned Yale New Haven Hospital 
(YNHH) for support, and, in 2018, they were able to begin 
providing gender-affirming care for one full day per week. 
During the pandemic, they added clinics on the first and fifth 
Thursdays each month, growing 
to their current total of nine to 
eleven clinics per month. As of 
2023, they provide services in 
New Haven, Trumbull, and Old 
Saybrook. To date, the YPGP has 
provided care to 425 people. But 
as more states across the country 
have adopted hostile attitudes 
toward trans teens, demand for 
the clinic’s services have grown, 
with patients streaming in from 
places as far away as Florida.
2020 was a difficult year for 
LGBTQ+ youth. 2021 was worse, 
and 2022 was no better. As of 
March 10th, 2023, bills have 
been introduced in 22 different 
state legislatures to criminal-
ize gender-affirming healthcare. 
Recently, both Tennessee and 
Mississippi passed bans on gender-affirming healthcare 
for minors, and several other states, including Texas, appear 
poised to be next. While Connecticut has reaffirmed its com-
mitment to the legality of gender-affirming healthcare, Dr. 
Olezeski still worries. “While yes, Connecticut is lucky to be 
in a place where there aren’t attacks actively happening, but it 
seems like the climate is still dangerous,” Dr. Olezeski said. 
But the harassment Dr. Olezeski and the YPGP faced last 
summer has only strengthened their commitment to the trans 
community. “We’re not stopping and we’re just going to con-
tinue to grow,” Dr. Olezeski emphasized. “It’s made our team 
stronger, I think. And so we’re not backing down.”


ROWAN
On the eleventh of every month, Rowan gets a calendar 
notification: “record voice update video.” With his catalog of 
monthly videos, he can look back and trace the changes in his 
voice, an effect of the testosterone he’s been taking for the last 
year. “As someone who does a lot of singing, I started as a mez-
zo-soprano and now I’m a bass baritone,” Rowan explained. 
“That’s super, super cool.” 
Rowan is fifteen years old, from South Windsor, CT. He 
loves Deftones, plays the guitar, and is excited about his 
upcoming role as Pugsley in his school’s production of The 
Addams Family. He’s also a patient at the YPGP.
When Rowan was thirteen, he told his parents he wanted 
to start testosterone. His voice dysphoria was so bad that he 
struggled to talk and didn’t want to leave the house. He had 
been questioning his gender since he was eleven, and he was 
finally sure that he wanted to pursue gender-affirming care. “I 
felt very guilty that I was kind of breaking their expectations 
of me,” Rowan remembered. Despite his anxiety, his parents 
were accepting from the beginning, and they were eager to 
meet his needs. They knew his quality of life was at risk.
In late 2020, Rowan and his parents got to work finding 
a clinic. Rowan’s parents called the YPGP, and they were lucky: 
when they called, the waitlist for an appointment was only 
three to five months. When the day of the appointment came, 
Rowan and his parents loaded up 
the car and drove for an hour to 
get to New Haven. He remem-
bered being a little nervous but 
“very excited to see where it was 
gonna lead me.” 
The YPGP was an instantly 
comforting space for Rowan. “It 
felt like they’re kind of a fam-
ily,” he said. Even though it 
was a doctor’s appointment, it 
felt like a casual conversation 
where he could express his needs. 
After Rowan explained what he 
needed out of the clinic, they 
explained the options they had 
available for him. Rowan left his 
intake appointment with a pre-
scription and a new outlook on 
life. “My confidence skyrocketed.”
Now, one year later, Rowan 
returns to the clinic every few months for follow-up appoint-
ments. First he meets with Dr. Boulware, then Dr. Olezeski 
and Dr. Patel. Rowan also meets with clinical psychology 
Ph.D. student Wisteria Deng to have a one-on-one conversa-
tion about his mental health and wellness. 
In 2022, Rowan found out about a unique opportunity 
from the clinic’s mailing list: a circus workshop for trans kids. 
Rowan participated for a few months that summer. “It was a 
really fun experience,” he said. The workshop was a space to 
learn skills ranging from juggling to walking balance beams, 
and doctors participated right alongside the kids. Even Dr. 
Olezeski picked up a new favorite party trick: she can now 
balance a peacock feather on her hand. 
At the Yale Pediatric Gender Clinic, Rowan has found 
more than just medical care: he’s found community. The YPGP 
changed Rowan’s life, and he knows it. “I’m very grateful that 
I have this privilege,” he acknowledged. Rowan’s case, how-
ever, is frustratingly rare. For many trans kids in New Haven 
and across Connecticut, access to care remains locked behind 
a waitlist and a multitude of structural barriers.

JUDE
Jude Arnott was referred to the YPGP in 2019 after he 
was hospitalized at the Yale New Haven Psychiatric Hospital. 
Jude, fifteen years old at the time, struggled with overwhelm-
ing emotions and didn’t know how to cope. He struggled with 
outbursts, aggression, and suicidal ideation. He would later 
realize that many of his struggles were the result of gender 
dysphoria, which he had struggled with for years. When he 
found himself back at YNHH in 2019, the doctors on-call rec-
ommended he make an appointment with Dr. Olezeski at the 
YPGP. So he tried. And tried. And tried.
When Jude told his parents in 2015 that he wanted to start 
to socially transition, his parents didn’t bat an eye. “I am one of 
the luckiest people,” said Jude. “My parents have health insur-
ance, they were supportive, and I was in a place where I could 
get gender-affirming healthcare.” But as Dr. Olezeski stressed, 
for every person like Jude, there is at least one teen who wants 
to transition, but doesn’t have parental support or the financial 
resources to do so. “I worry about those kids,” said Dr. Olezeski.
Jude was placed on the YPGP waiting list. The YPGP told 
him and Kathleen, his mother, that it would be at least three 
years until he could be seen for an intake appointment. But 
Jude was in need of immediate attention: he was in and out of 
the hospital, and his relationship with his brother and parents 
was under strain, punctuated by fights despite their support. 
He required treatment immediately, but the YPGP simply didn’t 
have the capacity. Jude and his parents had to look around for 
the next best option.
While Jude’s decision to leave the YPGP’s waiting list was 
quick, the process of finding other care was difficult. At first, 
Jude saw a gender therapist in the New Haven area. After six

months, he received a letter of written support from his thera-
pist attesting to his need for treatment—these letters are a nec-
essary first step toward beginning gender-affirming treatment 
at many clinics. He also obtained a referral to the Connecticut 
Children’s Medical Center’s Gender Identity Program (CCMC). 
Letter in hand, he and his family called CCMC to schedule an 
appointment. The process was quick: after his first visit at CCMC, 
Jude was prescribed puberty-blocking medication. A doctor 
placed an implant in his arm, and shortly thereafter he began 
hormone replacement therapy. 
Jude also attempted to get “top surgery,” a masculinizing 
bilateral mastectomy, from a surgeon at YNHH. According to 
Kathleen, the surgeon’s staff refused to update Jude’s legal name 
in their system, which she says led to them deadnaming Jude—
referring to him by the name on his birth certificate that he 
no longer identifies with—over twenty times. Kathleen strug-
gled with Anthem, her insurance provider, whose coverage of 
gender-affirming surgeries does not typically extend to minors. 
And then, after a year and a half of waiting, she received a call: 
the surgeon had retired, and the surgery was canceled.  The sur-
geon’s office didn’t return a request for comment. At the age of 15, 
and long after the ordeal at Yale, Jude was finally able to receive 
top surgery at CCMC. “It was tough for 
him, but if there’s one thing about Jude, 
if he wants to do something, he’s going 
to do it,” said Kathleen.
Families’ relationships with the 
YPGP differ, and wait times can vary 
widely from year to year. While 
Rowan was lucky enough to avoid 
the YPGP’s growing waitlist, Jude was 
never able to schedule an appoint-
ment despite an inpatient psychiatric 
referral. Oftentimes, a family’s experi-
ence with the YPGP is driven by fac-
tors outside their control. Insurance 
policies, distance between the clinic 
and a family’s home, and the support 
(or lack of support) parents show for 
their child all influence a family’s abil-
ity to find treatment. But for trans 
teens, time is ticking. With every passing minute, they’re going 
through puberty—the wrong puberty—and undergoing the 
unwanted, irreversible physical changes this puberty brings on.

ALEX
Alex, an eleven-year-old in New Haven, could be 
described as a free spirit. She refuses to conform to society’s 
expectations of what a boy or girl should be. She likes to 
experiment: with her uniform at Elm City Montessori, her 
name, her pronouns. She’s obsessed with Disney’s Frozen: 
according to her mother, Jessica, the movie was a forma-
tive part of Alex’s gender journey. Jessica and her wife didn’t 
think much of it at the time. “We were like, Alex is a kid who 
loves long hair, loves princesses, and loves powers. That kind 
of thing.”
As Alex grew, she felt limited by her peers’ expectations of 
her. She didn’t want to be a boy. She didn’t want to be a girl. 
But after talking with her parents, she decided that, if she had 
to be one or the other, “I choose girl,” she said. For Jessica, “the 
pressures are still there to call certain behaviors girl behaviors 
and others boy behaviors.” Even though, as Jessica was quick to 
point out, East Rock and New Haven are welcoming places to 
be trans, there are still biases and uncomfortable situations that 
Alex has encountered. For example, at school, there were only 
boys or girls uniforms for her to pick from. This is something 
that Jessica admits Alex will have to live with, but “so far, she’s 
doing a great job.” 
In late 2021, at the urging of their pediatrician, Alex’s par-
ents decided to schedule an intake appointment with the YPGP. 
They were informed that the wait time was thirteen months. 
But Alex had time. She hadn’t started puberty, and while the 
wait was long, it was something they were willing to put up 
with. The quality of care at the YPGP made the wait worth it, 
Jessica had heard. So as long as Alex was fine with the wait, 
there was nothing to lose—until they received another call 
from the YPGP. Alex’s appointment had been canceled, and 
they would have to reschedule for another thirteen months 
later. That was enough for Jessica. “There’s this feeling that 
maybe they’re providing great services, but if my kid can’t get 
them, that makes me mad.”
To meet the demand of their cur-
rent waitlist, the YPGP needs to add 
more clinic time and hire more doc-
tors. With appointments that average 
ninety minutes, they need more time 
than most endocrinology providers. 
However, the YSM administration has 
been pushing back on their requests for 
more resources. “When there’s limited 
space, they’re gonna say, ‘No, we don’t 
want you to open another gender clinic, 
we want you to open up a general 
endocrine clinic, because short kids 
need to be seen too,’” Dr. Boulware 
said, referring to cisgender kids who 
need support for atypical puberty. But 
there are dozens of endocrinologists 
treating cisgender kids in the New 
Haven area, while the YPGP is the only 
program serving trans kids.
As a stopgap measure to help those on the waitlist, the 
YPGP provides events and community to any trans kid in the 
area. Dr. Olezeski first started a parent support group and 
then expanded to a youth group. She offers the events to any-
one on her mailing list as a way to provide outlets for trans 
kids to connect with other trans kids.“We’ll try to get them 
involved in these other things to sort of have that community 
and support,” she said.
But supplemental programming can only go so far when 
patients are waiting two years to be seen. “We’re just asking 
for more money. Continuously more money,” Dr. Olezeski 
explained. “More money to hire more people.” Without insti-
tutional support, trans kids like Alex will continue to stare 
down extensive wait times at the expense of their physical and 
mental wellbeing. ∎
