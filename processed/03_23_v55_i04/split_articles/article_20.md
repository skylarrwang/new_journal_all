In the gay bar, the straight man 
becomes othered by his straightness. 
Sexuality is not defined by its relation 
to heterosexuality. It is defined, for 
once, in the context of queerness.

another friend of the bar, must have walked in.
“I question myself every day about that,” Joey says. 
“More and more people keep accepting the fact that 
there are different people. And because of that, our 
customer base is dropping. Now people are accepted. 
They can go anywhere they want right now, and have 
a really good time.” 
As he says this, I look at his face. His voice does 
not change, nor does he look upset. 
“Why do you think the bar has lasted as long as it 
has?” I ask. “Through so much?”
“We are resilient,” he says. His voice quiets. “But 
why? That’s the question.”
I pause when he says this. Joey had asked a 
question that I often think of: Why do we have to be 
resilient? Put another way, why does it cost so much 
strength to live?

T
he next day, 168 York is empty. The noise that 
filled the bar the night before has slipped out the 
window. Behind the counter, a bartender shuffles a 
set of cards, then lines them facedown on the counter. 
He plays by himself. I do not bother him.
In the next room, I meet Seth Evans. He is just 
about to have his weekly dinner here at 168 York. 
He sits under a dim spotlight, sipping on a golden 
drink. It glows in the light. Seth was the last editor-
in-chief of a Hartford-based LGBTQ+ publication 
called Metroline. The magazine intimately captured 
queer New England life from the AIDS epidemic to 
just after Connecticut’s legalization of gay marriage 
in 2008. Between their coverage of the epidemic 
and interviews with activists, the magazine adver-
tised the Connecticut bar scene. Seth knows many 
of the bars closely, especially 168 York, where he 
would write many of his own articles for Metroline 
at the counter.
“What does the gay bar mean to you?” I ask.
“The bar scene means to me what it means to the 
first person that walked into the oldest gay bar in 
Connecticut,” Seth says. “Sanctuary.”
“Sanctuary,” I repeat back to him.
“The normal kid grows up in a home environ-
ment where they’re seeing Mom and Dad, and all 
the normal heterosexual way things are supposed to 
be. Where does that kid get guidance?” Seth said. “If 
you don’t come out to the clubs and allow yourself to 
be yourself, you’ll never know who you are.”
This form of sanctuary is well-encapsulated in 
the pages of Metroline. Near the beginning of most 
issues, there are pictures of New Haven gay bars at 
their prime. A camera’s flash reveals wide smiles, 
sparkling drinks, bare skin. The dark rooms are 
filled to the brim with bodies. Queer joy is abun-
dant. Underneath, captions read their locations: 
Chapel Pub Cafe, Choices, Maxie’s, Saloon—all older 
New Haven bars. Large bar advertisements adorn 
almost every other page. The back of each Metroline 
edition reveals a list of clubs for each Connecticut 
city, all of which have advertised in the issue numer-
ous times. The sentiment was clear—the clubs were 
open and alive. 
“We started doing the magazine spreads of all 
the photos,” Seth says. “People would be very, very 
interested. They would go ‘Oh, I might be in it’ and 
they all started grabbing the magazine to look at it.”
As the years passed, though, Metroline began 
to falter. As more advertisers began using online 
mailing lists and other digital methods, Metroline, 
alongside other advertisement-reliant publications, 
took a hit. By the early 2010s, the magazine had 
become defunct. 
“The internet started coming in. And that started 
killing the magazine,” Seth says. “The bar owners 
more and more started saying, ‘Why should I pay an 
ad in your magazine?’ It just became financially not 
feasible to keep the magazine in print because the 
bars weren’t paying.”
Over the years, the bars listed on Metroline’s 
backpages started cycling out, too. Seth says him-
self that the lifespan of a bar at the time was at most 
seven years. In New Haven, the gay bars—Choices, 
Maxie’s, Saloon—slowly became replaced with the 
Brownstone, the Krpyt, Beach Head Cafe. And after 
a few years, those new names disappeared from the 
pages of Metroline. The addresses still exist today, but 
in their places, new businesses now stand. In some 
cases, only empty, desolate buildings remain. At a 
certain point, the only gay pubs that stood were 
Partners and 168 York.
“Will the bars continue to be a sanctuary?” I ask.
“It’s not as potent now as it was then. You’ll see 
straight couples come in and sit down and have 
drinks for a while. The acceptance, I don’t know if it’s 
a good way or a bad way, kind of diluted the popula-
tion.” he said. “You found different people coming in, 
you know, it became like foreigners in our sanctuary.”
“Acceptance,” to Seth, marked a departure from 
a point that a previous generation lived through. 
But how do we make progress while remembering 
the past?
“Do you feel that your experiences pre-acceptance 
are valued by my generation?” I ask bluntly. 
“They don’t know that they appreciate it yet,” he 
says. “Each of these generations contributed, you 
know, little bits of acceptance, little bits of acceptance, 
little bits of acceptance, it was a great wall built by 
one stone at a time.” 
In a Metroline article titled “Remembering 
Stonewall,” a contributor writes, “Our present com-
munity needs to remember the event with clar-
ity . . . The 25th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots is 
a suitable reminder to do the right thing.” Later in 
the article, the writer honors the Black, transgender 
and gender non-conforming activists who had been 
leading the queer liberation movements since the 
nineteen-sixties. In a later issue, the fear of a collec-
tive queer amnesia is spelled out in an op-ed titled: 
“WE MUST NEVER ACCEPT AIDS.” The con-
tributing writer opines to the remaining gay commu-
nity that an acceptance of AIDS would be “forgetting” 
an entire generation of “brothers” lost to the disease.
