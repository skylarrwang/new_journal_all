EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
We will live in a corner house.
And when it pours in the springtime, the cherry 
blossoms will float down, blanketing the block in 
pink icing. They will create a new earth; water will 
clear away the old. I will sit in our bay window 
while you do the crossword in the kitchen. I will 
count the yellow taxis that roll by and the poor 
souls  shrouded by large black umbrellas who fall 
victim to the not so shallow puddle at the base of 
our porch. This yellowed kitchen is a concert hall 
and we are the music, crowd, and singer. When I 
miss you, I just put on that Nina Simone record, 
the one you said was playing the night we met. I 
don’t remember, but you do—you always do. You 
follow behind while I scour the garage sale at the 
white picket fence house two streets over. My 
hands run over frayed garments, well-loved by 
someone else. I will lay in my favorite spot on the 
grass you’ve just mowed. You will admire the rays 
in between sneezes and red-rimmed eyes. 
Our beloved, ancient couch will be the first thing 
we move in. It will find its place in the center of 
a room covered in dark hardwoods. My fingers 
will trace the outline of carefully embroidered 
flowers as I’ve done a hundred times before. Too 
exhausted to lift anything else, we will collapse 
into its well known, sun-faded grooves.
At the end of our days, when the sun has fallen, 
we settle into the weathered, flowered couch. Your 
grandmother gave it to us. It was her mother’s. 
The cushions wear their age as she did. They cradle 
our bodies just right, morphed to our conjoined 
form over countless Sundays of use. I will lean 
into you and brush the hair from your shoulder. 
I will kiss your cheek and you will turn to meet 
me halfway. You taste like you always have: warm. 
Some nights we dance—off the couch, on our feet, 
around the peeling hardwoods. Nina’s voice rings 
through the speakers. You throw your head back 
to match her croon. I laugh in between steps—
not because it’s funny, but because I love you. 
Large oak trees will line our street. They’d be 
ominous if they weren’t so saintly. Quiet but never 
barren, home to laughter and lost kitten signs. 
Streets that swell with multi-colored leaves come 
autumn. You will point, placing bets on when 
they will fall. Just when we think they can’t hold 
anymore, we wake to find the asphalt submerged 
under a rust-colored sea. One that crunches 
under the running feet of eager vampires pushing 
their fangs back into place. The bloodsuckers are 
followed in single file by ghosts wearing tennis 
shoes and fire fighters with pigtails. You and I 
will wait for them to reach our front porch; the 
light is on. We pass out king-sized candy bars; our 
house will have quite the reputation. I make my 
best costume guess as the little ones arrive on our 
doorstep and reward them with sweets regardless 
of my blunders. When we’ve run out of currency, 
our jack-o’-lanterns still burn bright, so we sit 
on the rickety steps. When the winds reach our 
bones, we retreat to the television—back to that 
flowered couch. We sink into its cushions and I 
can feel all the other hallowed nights we’ve had 
together as if they’re happening all over again. We 
hear wolves howling over the screams of teenagers 
who need to be treated like adults. You slip out 
of costume still covered in makeup, half you, half 
make-believe.
