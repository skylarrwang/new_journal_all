Dear readers, 
The New Journal’s tagline has always been: “The Magazine about Yale and 
New Haven.” Our mission, as we understand it, is to represent these spaces 
through the stories of the people who occupy them. Recently, we’ve been 
thinking more about how best to do so. 

We began our year as a managing board by discovering a trove of dusty 
archives—hundreds and hundreds of time capsules of the University and 
the city. We ended the year with TNJFest, where the past collided with the 
present as alums of the last fifty years descended on the Branford Common 
Room. These bookends on our term have affirmed to us that TNJ is a living 
history, and journalism can do essential record-keeping. More than that, 
we’ve been reminded that longform can follow the narratives behind the 
numbers, make human the abstractions of headlines, and in doing so disrupt 
assumptions; contradict generalizations; and reveal gaps in the common 
discourse.

Across the nation, queer people are facing renewed threats. Dozens of bills 
have been passed in state legislatures this year that restrict transgender 
people from accessing gender-affirming care, despite medical consensus that 
this care is sound and necessary. Anti-LGBTQ+ violence is on the rise, and 
the tired caricature of queer people as predatory “groomers” has reappeared 
in popular media. At what may be a regressive inflection point for LGBTQ+ 
rights in America, the future hangs uncertain. 

In this issue, Abbey Kim explores queer Christians’ ongoing battles for 
acceptance in their churches. Jabez Choi chronicles the decline of gay bars, 
and asks the question: what is the meaning of a “safe” space? Sasha Carney 
traces the history of lesbian social life on campus, and Jools Fu navigates the 
complicated masculinity of the Singapore Armed Forces. Theia Chatelle 
and Iz Klemmer explore the obstacles trans kids face when seeking gender-
affirming care, while Hannah Szabó remembers the spaces and people that 
supported her own journey during childhood. 

These stories aim to situate some of New Haven’s queer life in both history 
and experience. We hope to do in this issue the same thing we have sought 
to do since 1967, a purpose reiterated in our October 2001 issue’s letter from 
the editors: to put our moment in context.

TNJ love,
The Managing Board
