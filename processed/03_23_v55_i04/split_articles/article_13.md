Basic Military Training (BMT) 
is a milestone in the lives of all 
Singaporean men. It marks their man-
datory enlistment into the Singapore 
Armed Forces (SAF). The training cen-
ter isn’t even on the mainland; boys are 
packed onto ferries and shipped to Pulau 
Tekong, an island right off the coast of 
Singapore. It’s where their identification 
cards are exchanged, and suddenly they 
are no longer “citizens” but “NSF” (Full-
time National Servicemen). It’s where the 
SAF shaves the boys’ heads and the tropi-
cal sun burns their scalps. It’s where they 
fire their first rifle, where they dig their 
first trench, and where they start the end-
less cycle of physical and strategic combat 
training. After two months of grueling 
regimentation, recruits graduate and are 
then assigned to military vocations. The 
top 20 percent of recruits are sent to com-
mand school to undergo further combat 
training, Officer Cadet School (OCS) to 
become an officer, or Specialist Cadet 
School (SCS) to become a sergeant. But 
BMT is the start of any military career. Its 
motto: “Where boys become men.”


I entered BMT as an 18-year-old, 
having gone to high school in the 
United Kingdom and therefore largely 
unfamiliar 
with 
Singaporean 
soci-
ety. National Service had always been 
something I dreaded. All throughout 
high school I had been bullied by other 
boys, who called me a “faggot” and 
kicked me when teachers weren’t look-
ing. I was often reduced to tears, made 
to feel unfathomably small, and help-
lessly alone. If high school was like 
that, I couldn’t imagine what the army 
would be like. I considered myself a pro-
gressive, I thought militaries shouldn’t 
exist, and I knew my queerness was not 
accepted. I made the conscious choice 
to remain closeted. I enlisted with the 
bold assumption that the army was not 
going to change me or my beliefs. But to 
avoid being criticized or belittled, I tried 
my best to excel in this performance 
of masculinity. 


I did well. My athleticism translated 
well to military training. I accepted the 
torrent of insults and verbal abuses my 
sergeants hurled at me. And when I was 
commended for my abilities, a part of me 
truly enjoyed it. For the first time in my 
life, I was considered tough and strong. 
I completed BMT fifth in my platoon of 
sixty-four, and I earned a position in 
SCS. A week later, I started my training 
to become a sergeant and a commander.


In SCS, I spent six months learning 
more advanced forms of combat and 
familiarizing myself with a diverse array 
of weapons, from machine guns to RPGs. 
I navigated miles of dense vegetation 
while carrying a seventy-pound field 
pack. I survived in the jungle for nine 
days without any contact with the out-
side world. With the completion of each 
exercise, the joy I found in the military 
became more real. I enjoyed infantry 
training in a way that would have been 
entirely alien less than a year before, 
intoxicated with my adaptation to an 
ideal masculinity. When I graduated, I 
was assigned to be a BMT trainer. Upon 
receiving my posting order, I promised 
myself I would be different, patient. “Be 
the change you want to see” was what I 
kept repeating to myself.


I remember the first time I made 
another person cry. He was part of the 
first batch of recruits I ever trained. In 
the first few weeks of their training, 
the recruits are given snacks to eat at 
night, as a part of their grace period: 
packaged buns, stuffed with artificially 
flavored cream the color and texture of 
playdough. The buns tasted like noth-
ing but sugar, which was pure heaven 
compared to the nauseating food that 
we ate at the cookhouse. I’d had a 
rough day—contrary to my expecta-
tions, being a trainer was not simple 
and I was growing more and more frus-
trated with how ineffective I felt. My 
strategy of patience seemed completely 
inept compared to the fear other com-
manders were able to strike into their 
recruits. As much as I wanted to be 
morally strong, I felt myself becoming 
alienated.  I was barely sleeping, and 
I hardly had time to eat. So, when I 
caught a glimpse of a recruit running 
out of his bunk to grab an extra bun 
from the parade square after lights out, 
I lost it. What came out was closer to 
barking than yelling, and it echoed so 
loudly that some heads peeked out from 
the fifth floor. “What the fuck do you 
think you’re doing?” He dropped the 
bun instantly, keeping his head down as 
I unleashed my wild wrath on him. As 
he walked away, I realized the blotches 
on his shirt were not sweat marks, but 
tears. When I reentered the company 
office, my friends and fellow command-
ers dapped me up. Later, my captain 
pulled me aside and commended me 
for enforcing discipline. As I went back 
to my bunk, I smiled for the first time 
in a while.


Bing Jie was in my third and final 
batch of recruits. By then, I had grown 
into a seasoned trainer. I had learned 
to harness my unbridled fury on my 
recruits, breaking them down physically 
and mentally into passive bodies, mold-
able soldiers. My rage was a defense 
mechanism, a way to throw others off 
my trail. If I could be “tough” and harsh 
on my recruits, no one, not even the 
boys from high school, could call me 
a “faggot” anymore. Before enlistment, 
a batch is given a grade based on their 
expected physical and mental compe-
tency. My first two batches had been A’s; 
Bing Jie’s was a C, and I felt the differ-
ence immediately. No matter how hard I 
pushed, they couldn’t meet my timings. 
They were consistently late, none of 
them could perform any marching drills 
in sync, some couldn’t even hold up a 
rifle without shaking from the effort. It 
was a combination of physical inability 
and mental disinterest. But I had to be 
the one that got them there.


The Combat Circuit is BMT’s most 
difficult physical training. It requires 
recruits to dress in full battalion order, 
including 
field 
packs, 
suffocating 
armored vests, and heavy helmets. Then, 
they’re thrown into an outdoor training 
ground, made to climb steep hills, dash 
from tree to tree, and crawl through 
thick mud. The exercise is supposed 
to simulate the motions of jungle war-
fare. When I was a recruit, our sergeant 
shouted insults at us as we did the cir-
cuit, and I did the same to my recruits. 
Nothing was off limits. I was telling 
them how worthless they were as they 
scrambled about, their rifles swinging 
wildly by their neck, knocking into 
their chins. Suddenly someone shouted 
out in alarm. Bing Jie had disintegrated 
into a crumpled heap underneath his 
field pack, which was larger than him. 
I thought he was faking it. Three hours 
later, after the medical staff had evalu-
ated he needed to be sent to a hospital, I 
volunteered to go.


My commanding officer gave 
me the next few days off, and 
my house wasn’t far from the hospi-
tal. Under moonlight, the quiet roads 
felt like burgeoning gulfs. I reached 
into my pocket to find a crushed pack 
of Marlboro Reds for a smoke, a habit 
I had picked up in SCS, but I couldn’t 
find my lighter. Somewhere along the 
way, a car drove past me, its headlights 
illuminating my dirty silhouette against 
an empty shopping mall. At the sight 
of me, the driver was startled. I felt 
like a ghost from the jungle, a savage 
specter haunting the city. About a mile 
from my house, I passed by the twen-
ty-four-hour McDonalds that I used to 
beg my mum to take me to when I was 
a kid. A group of drunk teenage boys 
was there, trying to scale the attached 
playground. I was reminded of combat 
obstacle courses. In a couple years at 
most, they too would be starting BMT, 
like I had, like Bing Jie did, like all of 
us would. It was an unending cycle of 
vicious masculinity: violence begetting 
more violence. Staring at them, I felt 
a shuddering discomfort. I averted my 
eyes and walked home.


In the next two months, I graduated 
from the military and arrived at Yale. 
On my first night out in New Haven, 
my combat boots soaked up sticky 
concoctions of beer, vodka, and fruit 
mixers instead of the squelching dirt, 
dead leaves, and rifle shells of the jungle 
floor. As I danced in the middle of the 
sloshing crowd, a group of men snaked 
their way in, bluntly pushing through 
me. A couple months prior, I would’ve 
shoved back, maybe more. But, some-
thing had shifted since that night walk. 
To protect myself, I had adopted the 
violent tools of those before me, leaving 
Bing Jie in the hospital. Performing mas-
culinity had not caused more harm. So 
I simply stared at them, not wanting to 
engage anymore. 


I thought that I’d find solace in queer 
spaces, because it was the first time I 
could be so open about my own queer-
ness. At an Office of LGBTQ Resources 
mixer, I was handed a nametag. “What 
do I write here?” I asked someone. “Your 
pronouns!” they answered. I tentatively 
put down “he/him,” unsure if it was 
who I wanted to be anymore, but equally 
terrified of the alternative. The group 
shared their collective trauma: the ways 
in which they were shunned, bullied, 
and derided for their difference, largely 
by the men in their lives. I thought about 
every punishment I had ever subjected 
my recruits to. With each anecdote 
getting heavier and heavier, I left early, 
ashamed of myself. I hadn’t said a word 
to anyone.


I felt helplessly alone those first few 
months, but I refused to ask for help. 
On Halloween night, while everyone 
around me prepared their costumes and 
left for parties, I laid paralyzed in my 
dorm. Without thinking, I grabbed a 
pair of scissors from my table and made 
around a half-dozen slashes on my fore-
arm. Later that night, one of my suite-
mates called 911, and I was escorted to 
the psychiatric ward of Yale New Haven 
Hospital. While undergoing innumer-
able administrative, psychological, and 
medical procedures, what struck me 
the most was how easily my body fell 
into the monolithic category of “male.” I 
kept thinking about my position in the 
genealogy of manhood that I had known 
before: from the boys in school, the ser-
geants that trained me, and finally me to 
Bing Jie. I didn’t want to be a part of the 
lineage anymore. When I left the hos-
pital, I walked back to my dormitory in 
the clear, cold New Haven morning air. 
The sun was the brightest thing I could 
see and a part of me strangely felt stable. 
Being a “man” was eating me alive, so I 
decided to stop.


In five months, I will have spent 
more time outside the military than in 
it. There is always an impulse to roman-
ticize those times: the late night instant 
noodle parties, the raves we went to 
on our days off, the satisfying sense 
of exhaustion after finishing an exer-
cise. I still miss catching crabs off the 
old bridge that we snuck out to when 
our recruits were asleep, and the genu-
ine moments of tenderness in between 
smoke breaks and barking orders. That’s 
what I instinctively remember about 
all of it. But the SAF’s commands are 
all still there, in encrypted WhatsApp 
messages on my phone. When writing 
this piece, I spent hours sifting through 
them. The image of Bing Jie, unable to 
even crawl in that field, is still there. ∎
