**Title: 1. Smash, Bang, Crash**
**Author: Brian Overland, 1980**
**Page number(s): 5**

We're going to start a panic in Harvard 
Square, 
Right after we send a jolt through Nassau 
· Halli 
We're going to make them suffer, but we 
don't care, 
The truth is we like to watch them cry 
and bawl. 
Smash! Bang! Crash! Eli's men will st9r~ 
and rail! 
Smash! Bang! Crash! Poor old Harvard we 
will nail! 
As we smash! Bang! Crash! For Eli Yale! 
The startling energy and vigor of this song 
reminds us at once~of the warrior poems of old. 
The author's conltdent assertion that "we don't 
care" about the enemy's suffering recalls the lordly 
detachment of Achilles as he abandons the hard-
pressed Greek army. The notion of the hero as 
someone who stands outside the social and moral 
codes of his day is plainly at work here. 
The idea of panic recurs throughout the song, 
conjuring up a frightening picture of the utter 
tragedy of defeat. One is reminded of Byron's 
"The Destruction of Sennacherib": "And the 
widows of Ashur are loud in their wail/ And the 
idols are broke in the temples of Baal." Defeat 
means more than just material or economic loss 
for the vanquished; it loosens the very 
underpinnings of social unity. Mr. Overland 
reflects this sense of chaos with the resonant 
"Smash! Bang! Crash!" of the refrain. The result 
is a poem of striking power and brutality. The 
masterful ltfth line is enough to send shivers of 
barbarian glee down even the most civilized spines. 


**Title: 2. Mother Yale**
**Author: Scott MacCiarty, 1980**

We're not afraid of Princeton, and we're not 
afraid of Brown, 
And Dartmouth doesn't scare us; we'll run 
them out of town. 
We leave the Crimsons shaking, 'cause 
Harvard has no chance! 
Although they wear their cleats, its Mother 
Yale who wears the pants. 
REFRAIN: 
We'll ltght for Mother Yale, 
We'll ltght for good old Eli and for 
Mother Yale, 
The one we'll ever stand by-only Mother 
Yale! 
Our hearts belong to you, so give another 
wail! 
It's for the team that wears the blue! 


**Title: Yale, For Thee**
**Author: Jim Gardner, 1980**

Yale for thee, thy victory, 
Our voices now as one we raise; 
Guaranteed ascendancy for Eli throughout 
our college days; 
Onward go, your prowess show 
Each foe your mighty will obeys. 
For our hearts and minds eternally 
We tender unto Eli, as Yale we praise. 
Anthropologists tell us that ancestor worship 
evolved as the ltrst form of religion in many 
cultures. Perhaps it was the dead ancestor who was 
invoked for strength in the ltrst tribal battle songs. 
These two works seem to rely heavily on pagan 
ritual and belief, particularly with regard to 
ancestor worship. 
Mr. Gardner addresses his song of adoration to 
a numinous force dubbed •Yale', which possesses 
no physical appearance or attributes, but hovers 
cloudlike above the plane of the poem. There is 
some suggestion at the end that this is in fact Eli 
Yale, a legendary ancestor from the distant past, 
but this is not developed. In any event the author 
clearly speaks as a worshipper of this force, 
singing its praise and carrying forth its glory 
throughout time. One is reminded of the ancient 
heroic ballads, which were sung by the baras 
partly to preserve the immortality of the hero. The 
notion of memory as life is important here. 


**Title: 4. The Big Blue Wave**
**Author: Steve Hayes, 1981**

Eli! Eli! The Big Blue wave is breaking! 
Now the wave is at its height! 
Now the bulldog growls with all his might! 
Eli! Eli! And Victory's for the taking! 
Big Blue victory's in sight, as we fight for 
Eli Yale! 
Eli! Eli! The Big Blue wave is rising! 
The save will crash, the field will quake! 
The wave is leaving conquest in its wake! 
Eli! Eli! And Harvard is capsizing! 
Blues will win, make no mistake, for the 
sake of Eli Yale! 
The use of metaphor achieves a vivid effect in 
both these songs. Mr. Hayes uses the image of an 
enormous wave to characterize the might of the 
Yale team. One is reminded of Byron's description 
of the Assyrian army: "And the sheen o.f their 
spears was like stars on the sea/ When the blue 
wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee." The image 
here is not a serene one, however, but a violent 
one. The repetition of the "ake" sounds 
throughout the poem creates a harsh slamming 
effect similar to Tennyson's famous "Break, 
break: break,! On thy cold grey stones, 0 sea." 
The result is a poem of towering might and 
beauty. It is interesting that the Harvard team is 
portrayed as being at sea (cf ... capsizing") while 
the wave itself is breaking onto the field; perhaps 
there is a mythical allusion intended. 


**Title: 5. Bulldog Blues**
**Author: Sam Zurier, 1980**

When the Crimson sabers rattle, 
And the bears of Brown do roar, 
Eli's troops will come to battle 
Like we always have before. 
We will meet them and defeat them 
As we ride our victor cruise 
They can run, they can race, but they'll get 
second place 
When they face our bulldog blues! 
We will rally the Eli's nation 
From the Bowl to Wooster Square, 
As we establish domination 
On the ground and in the air. 
So let's give three cheers, for the 
good years 
Cause we know we cannot lose, 
They can use all their men, but we'll 
beat them again
