If you continue to be a very good American, 
we're told you'll go to Paris when you die. In the 
meanwhile for those who fmd that too high a price 
(though it's not much steeper than the combined 
cost of the two books here under review), there are 
memories: those who've visited that greatest of 
capital cities have their own; those who haven't 
have other people's. One prefers Proust or Colette, 
but photographs-once defined by Robert de 
Montesquiou as "mirrors with memories"- will 
occasionally do. These two picture-books-so 
contrary in many ways, the one just Grub Street 
junk food, the other a lavish and learned Quality 
Item-serve both sorts of people. The Joy of Paris 
(by the way, whom do we blame-poor old Irma 
Rombauer?-for kicking off the craze for "Joy-
of" titles?) is for those who don't know Paris; The 
Great Houses of Paris is for those who know it 
well enough to have envied those special places 
.One lsn 't Permitted To Visit. 


The heart sinks when you first open The Joy of 
Paris. To begin with, there's-what! another?!-a 
shot of the Arc de Triomphe. (If there were 
custard pies made to be thrown at 
monuments ... ) Then, worse yet, there's the start 
of the flimsy, interfacing text, whose single merit is 
its brevity. It is an odious example of what must 
be called brochurese. For instance: 
"Let yourself go. Don't be afraid to be 
fanciful. Paris is the stuff dreams are made 
of. That is what Paris is there for. In Paris 
everything is 'fou, fou, fou.' Mad, wild, 
crazy. Dream a little of Paris. Close your eyes 
and pretend you don't know the 'real' Paris 
exists. Close your eyes and dream of that 
'other' Paris. It's an essential antidote to the 
aggressive bustle which makes Paris Paris. 
Start with a stereotype like Pia f. " 

Okay, my eyes are closed. Now, take that Piaf 
record off the stereotype. Put on, oh, the Faure! 
piano quartet; it has the same delicious 
sentimentality, but without the wide eyes and hot 
flashes. Okay, now show me Mr. Hermann's 
photographs. 

Ah, but one has seen them before. The polite 
term used to be "calendar art." Wide-angle 
gimmkks hanging from the Eiffel Tower, 
glamorous women at the racetrack lounging in the 
sumptuous insouciance of fashion magazine poses, 
lots of plumage and armor, the chorus line at the 
Folies, and the usual Cartier-Bresson imitations: 
old men at boules, widows in black peering out of 
19th-century storefronts, kids scuffling in the 
streets as pigeons flutter up toward ... why, 
toward "elusive, enigmatic Paris, city of a million 
iUusions." Fou, fou, fou-y. 

What a French intellectual would style as 
Hermann's image-repertoire is a very summery and 
prettily peopled Paris indeed. There is none of the 
city's severe beauty, that oyster-shell gray of 
winter. And most of his photographs include 
people, from the standard entwined couples on the 
quais, to a new but entirely appropriate touch, 
Japanese tourists. It is as if Hermann needed to 
domesticate and ingratiate his views. Rarely does 
he scramble our stale expectations, but he does 
have a good eye for crowds, and finds several 
striking portraits. (My favorite is of butchers 
unJoading sides of beef from a truck; they are 
burly men, and in their bloody cowls resemble 
nothing so much as Rodin's statue of Balzac.) 

Hermann's temperament is strictly official. His 
camera never probes. it only soothes. There is no 
poverty. only the picturesque. No dullness, 
disgrace, kinkiness. 1be fabled sensuousness of the 
French is emptied of all its allure by being made to 
look either innocent or gaudy. Institutions-from 
the family to the museum, Maxim's to the 
Academie- prevail. 

And yet ... The extent to which we indulge 
pictures of this sort-which are like very smart 
slides of someone else's trip-is the extent to 
which everyone has his own view of Paris and 
enjoys comparing remembered and realized scenes. 
The advantage the mind claims over the eye is that 
it can summon back sensations, and many of one's 
deepest, most evocative and eloquent memories of 
Paris could never be caught in a photograph. The 
smell of espresso and cheap caporal tobacco and 
pissoirs. The sound of someone reciting 
Baudelaire's "Recueillment. " The taste of be/on 
oysters and old chevre and a great fat Burgundy. 
The pleasant after-effect of Bernard Hermann's 
pictures is that they start up one's own magic 
lantern. 

How refreshing and exciting, then, to tum to 
The Great Houses of Paris, which puts the 
"civilization" back into the city. Hermann gives us 
an ''unreal" Paris, cossetted and contrived. 
Frc!gnac and Andrews remind us that 
"contrivance" literally designates an assembly of 
tropes-figures no less real for being highly 
imaginative, wealthy with the rhetoric of the grand 
gesture and rich display. 

The decorative arts have always held a high 
place in French culture, but we have not always 
tried to understand fully their function and 
meaning. Now, with the writings of Roland 
Barthes and the increasing refinement of a system 
of interpretation based on linguistic science but 
applicable to non-verbal media, when we confront 
classic houses and interiors we can decipher them, 
no longer simply inspecting them. We now 
approach these great civic residences, most of them 
state-owned, in an almost "anthropological" 
spirit. Tell us, we say to them, what it was to live 
here then, to be those first inhabitants, to think 
their thoughts. 

It is impossible, for example, to leaf through 
The Great Houses of Paris without speculating on 
the role played by ornament in the furnishings and 
interior spaces of 17th and 18th-century houses. 
Ornament seems to have been a means of 
conferring existence on objects. of proving their 
importance by making a small arena of iconic 
significance out of a medallioned wall panel, say, 
or the fluted leg of a writing desk. In French 
neoclassical decoration, objects in wood, porcelain, 
or glass apparently will be legible. or will not be at 
all. The book inspires-or rather, commands--
admiration for these objects. 

A few technical matters: the book is handsomely 
produced. with sharp photographs in color and in 
black~d-white printed on hiJUl-gloss paP.Cr. 

Nearly all the photographs are excellent; they are 
telling and carefully composed. The adjunct text, 
though not distinguished in its writerly qualities. is 
rich in historical and cultural detail. It tells much 
of what is known about the frrst residents of these 
houses, as well as non-technicalJy, ·the particular 
virtues of each-larger coverage, probably, than 
most who lift this book from its place on the 
coffee-table will actually require. 

I have visited about a quarter of the houses 
pictured. Some are now museums, others visitable 
only on certain days and with a special guide, and 
others, private houses or offices of state, generally 
closed to the public. To stroll through the book, 
then, is to oscillate between the symmetrical shocks 
of recollection and surprise. It is to see gorgeous 
pictures of the Hotel de Soubise or Hotel Lauzun. 
whose interiors have the jewel-like perfection of 
Faberge boxes, and to reflect that these are, royal 
palaces aside, the most beautiful houses extant 
from the 17th century. At least until I came upon 
pictures of the Hotel Lambert, in which the Baron 
Guy de Rothschild lived privately and which I have 
never visited. 

The house is one of Le Vau's most harmonious 
designs, combining strength, complexity, and 
refmement. The interiors are awe-inspiring. For 
example, the library, so filled with treasurable 
books and so encrusted with ormolu as to resemble 
itself a preciously bound volume, is the setting for 
paintings such as lngres's portrait of Betty de 
Rothschild, and-can it be?-Vermeer's The 
Astronomer. This painting is listed in catalogues 
always under the rubric, "Private collection, 
Paris." The photograph caption here expressly 
makes no mention of the painting, so that for a 
moment one can speculate that it is only a copy; 
but after a further scansion of the room, and of 
the other rooms pictured, one abandons, with a 
gulp, that hypothesis. 

The Hotel de Biron will bring back fond 
memories to those who think of it primarily as the 
Musc!e Rodin, with its collection of that puzzling 
sculptor's vulgar but grand work; considered as 
architectural achievement, and with its huge 
garden and reflecting pool, it would merit a visit 
even without the collection. (Indeed, I felt a twinge 
of envy for an older friend of mine, a lady who 
lived there briefly in the first decade of this 
century, when she was a schoolgirl and it was a 
Convent of the Sacred Heart.) As for sculpture, 
the Hotel de Rohan with its stupendous "Horses 
of the Sun," a pediment carved by the sculptor 
Robert Le Lorrain in the early 18th century and 
one of the few pedimental groups that can be 
placed without scandal beside the Elgin marbles, is 
equally worth the effort of seeking in the Marais 
quarter.· 

Oh, but one could go on-on to the Hotel 
Matignon and the Elysc!e Palace-but they defy 
any easier description than a photograph confers. 
Taken as a whole, these great houses of France at 
the pinnacle of its cultural achievement must be 
considered without rival-except perhaps for the 
imperial Japanese residences at Katsura, built 
within a diametrically opposed aesthetic of 
bareness and plainness. In them, man is presented 
as subordinate to a vaster and ftnally ungraspable 
nature. In the sumptuous houses of Paris, man is 
enthroned. lord of the earth and master of the 
salon, possessor of Ideas nowhere to be found in 
nature, except where the hand of artifice has 
embodied them.
