. at ~e track, if that's !h~ horse you pay to have 
SCTVIce your mare. This IS a pure breeding 
experiment. We now know a lot about why they 
work but that doesn't give us a practice. If, 
eventually. they start finding a couple of genes in 
the chr~mosomes of a horse that have something 
t~ do With speed, and they start fiddling around 
w1th those genes, then you've got something. We 
haven :t got there even in genetics, let alone 
bebav1or. 

DW Would it be incorrect to speak of a cau$al 
relationship between a gene and a behavior even if 
there were 
known correlation between them? 

BFS If you have a mare and you say: "I want 
this mated to a Spectacular Bid and I want to pay 
$50,000 for it," and someone says, "Why are you 
doing that?", and you say, "Well, there's a little 
gene somewhere . . . " 

DW So~our objection isn't a philosophicol 
objection about mixing ontological levels? 

BFS No. What I object to is a phony physiology, 
like .. "Your nerves are on edge." People still say 
things lilce that.

DW You mention tlult Bertrand Russell 
irifluenced W>Ur work. 

BFS 
He was .~ popularizer. Principia 
Matltematica, I think is still accepted, though .it 
should be by now. He did that over seventy years 
ago. It should have been changed by now. 
Wittgenstein, Russell, the logical positivists, all 
of those people: I never went very far with them 
really. Rusself, was a prestigious person. I read his 
review of Ogden Richard's The Meaning of 
Meaning, and be ended it by saying, "The reader 
will see that I have been enormously influenced by 
Dr. Watson, whose recent book Behaviourism I 
regard as massively impressive." Well, that was all 
I n~ed. 

I never knew very much about Russell. I admire 
Russell a good deal. He had some very interesting 
ideas about marital questions. He was against the 
Vietnam business, and sat in Trafalgar Square in 
protest when be was ninety years old, carefully 
having an inflatable pillow in his pants before be 
went there. 

For example, I don't go very far with people 
like Gilbert Ryle, or Ayer. and all of those people. 
They dido 't have the science of behavior needed. 
Wittgenstein towards the end groped for it. He 
said, "We will have to study the behavior of 
animals to get this thing clear. • • 

This was in the Blue and Brown Books and in 
Philosophical Investigations also. The Tractatus he 
himself abandoned. 

I starte'd to look at the Blue and Brown 
Books. Every sentence started me off on 
something else. I cannot accept that kind of 
wordplay. I'd say it's true of Ayer and Ryle and 
the whole gang. 

They're not getting back to fundamentals. That 
goes for Chomsky too. They don't get back to the 
actual behavior involved. 

DW You have Sllid tlu:Jt you do not like 
contemporary philosophy of science. Were you 
rrun~c.rng of the Vien1Ul Circle, or of Thomas Kuhn 
D W In Verbal Behavior you seem to quote with 
approval a passage from Russell where he SllYS that 
words don 'I refer to things. 

BFS I don't think I quote him with approval. I 
didn't like what he said. His book, Inquiry into 
Meaning and Truth. was a very. very sloppy thing 
and I didn't like any of that. He used a rather 
crude conditioned reflex idea of meaning, and it 
just doesn't make any sense at all. I've forgotten 
exactly how I put it, but it's in Verbal Behavior. 
[Skinner goes to the bookshelf and returns with 
Verbal Behavior) 

D W 
When you say of this quote, "In one sense 
this is a fair shot, " in what sense do you mean? 

BFS (quoting himself from Verbal Behavior) "In 
one sense this is fair shot. The hardy determinist 
will recognize a tendency to believe that what be is 
saying is, for the moment at least, removed from 
the field of determined action. 
"But the student of behavior is not the only one 
to face this dilemma. Behaving about behaving 
raises the same difficulties as knowing about 
knowing." 

D W So tlu:Jt ~ the sense in which lte is correct. 
You don't believe that words don't refer to things. 

BFS Oh yes. He had given the William James 
lectures the year before, and so I was probably 
being kind to him. -
But I was thinking of something else of his. 
There's another reference here rm Verbal 
Behavior]. There are a whole lot of references; two 
four. six eight, ten. That's an awful lot for one 
book. But there was one in there about bow, when 
we see a fox, we say 'fox\ and so on. Actually, 
what be said was not correct. I'm sure of that. On 
the whole question of reference, Watson made the 
same mistake. He was trying to get the whole th.iJlg 
in terms of conditioned reflexes. 

That's one of the cases where I've been 
misunderstood. I am not a stimulus response 
psychologist. 


When interviewed by Ewms, you said, "The 
study of perception suffers from the idea tlu:Jt one 
is somehow relating experience to reality. " How 
does it su.t/er from this? 

BFS There is no difference between experience 
and reality. It's the same thing. 

This is the old copy theory. Those flowers: I 
can't see them out there 011 the counter. so I must 
have a copy of them back here that I'm seeing. 
This is Plato. He couldn't understand how you 
could see something at a distance. I don't know 
bow he figured you got the copy in there either. 
There is no copy. That's even out of focus on 
my retina. The idea that, somehow. I can 
reconstruct those flowers out of neural events in 
the back of my head is absurd. When I shut my 
eyes I can still see them. I don't see them very 
well, but I can still do with my eyes shut what I do 
with my eyes open. 

There is not a world of experience. There is a 
world, and there's behavior with respect to that 
world. The idea that I-only have a psychological 
world inside me and that's what everything 
is-that's nothing unless it ll!eaDS something to 
me. Such meaning is in my behavior and in my 
history. 

DW What do you think is the correct use of the 
word 'causality'? 

BFS Well, I think I've said somewhere that 
operant behavior is the field of purpose. It's the 
effect of the future on the present. What appears 
to be the 'future directedness• of behavior is due 
to the past consequences and not, of course, to the 
actual future consequences, which can never act at 
all. There's no First Cause. The future can't act. 
But we are directed towards the future because we 
are reacting in ways which have had consequences 
in the past." 

I have a manuscript I should get around to 
publishing called Selection by Consequences in 
which I compare natural selection, operant 
conditioning, and the evolution of cultures. They 
all raise the same questions. Who creates? Darwin 
had a creation problem and I have a creation 
problem. 

Cultures arise from the social contract. What is 
the goal and what is the purpose? The band is not 
to grasp things but is the way it is because it bas 
grasped things in the past successfully. These same 
issues come on all three levels, all due to the fact 
that this is a causal principle which only exists in 
living things, selection by consequences. It emerged 
from the world with the emergence of life. 

DW Is this c:au.sol principle differenttlu:Jn a fully 
reduced mechanistic principle? 

BFS This full kind of causality? Oh, yes. That is 
why it is quite wrong to say that I treat animals 
like machines. They can't be machines. No 
machine can do what an animal does. You can 
program a computer to be modified by 
consequences only because a human being designed 
it. No machine is affected by consequences. 

Darwin was the one who really finally 
enumerated the ideas of natural selection. Hence, 
you don't have to have design or purpose to begin 
it. I think human behavior is precisely the same 
thing. You don't will, you don't plan, you don't 
initiate action. You are affected by the 
consequences of past action. You can design at all 
three levels. That's a later step that only happens 
when a culture emerges which puts the individual 
in possession of everything needed for design. 
Then you can design genetically. In the old days, 
they used breeding; now they can do it by fiddling 
around with the variations. You can design 
behavior by consequences and arrange 
reinforcement, contingencies, behavior 
modification. 

You also get new behaviors by sort of modeling 
behavior: giving instructions to get something 
done, then you reinforce. Cultures almost always 
just fiddle with the variations-new ways of 
teaching and so on-but you can, if you want to, 
change the contingencies of selection of the 
culture. You say, "Let's keep the Samoan culture 
intact." 

DW Would tlu:Jt be a good idea? 

BFS No, I don't think ... What do you mean, 
'good idea'? But it could be done. You could 
select a cultural practice by making sure that it 
works. But it isn't done. Ordinarily with cultures 
we only fiddle with the variation, not the selection.

I don't know Kuhn's stuff well. Paradigms 
and so on. I don't know what he's saying. I have 
never had any desire to look into it. 

I say something myself a bit about scientific 
method. I think we can analyze how scientists 
work. As a matter of fact, one point of the 
autobiography is to give as honest an account as I 
can of how I have been working as a scientist. No 
nonsense about testing hypotheses and so on. I 
don't do that at aU. 

DW You mentioned. in one inl6viLw, tlu:Jt you

just a question of classi£acation thou&b. He did

Different cultures do it in different ways and the 
culture which makes the most of the people in the 
group is going to be the most likely to solve its 
problems and survive. 

So you have a competition. There's an evolution 
pf effective cultural practices which i"' th~ :answer 
to "Who is to decide?" It's like asking a fish, 
• 'Why do you want to get out of the water and 
walk on land?" No decision is ever made. 

DW How do you feel about the treotment of 
perception by the classical empiricists? 

BFS Oassical empiricists-the British 
Empiricists-were associationists and they bad you 
doing things to the world. Even though it was 
much better than what bad been done before, 
there was a mind which was picking up these 
impressions. It was a tabula rasa which was getting 
these things written on it. I don't think 
auociationism will do anything at all. 1be rat 
doesn't press the lever because he associates 
pre:ssina with food. He presses because food 
follows when be presses. That's a very different
