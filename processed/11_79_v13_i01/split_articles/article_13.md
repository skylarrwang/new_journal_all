Deconstruction and Witticism 
Bride of Derrida 
- Heart of Glass 
The exigencies, or urgencies, or emergencies of our disestablished era have 
pressed or oppressed us to a greater revaluation of our less conspicuous 
alternatives. Poetry as the sine qua non, the critic's duenna of rehabilitated 
consciousness, pales before the varied claims and shames of simplistic but 
ever more achingly present truths (Nietzsche). Akenside, in the 1740s, who 
saw wtth striking prescience the setting star of Abendland rise in the east of 
literary history, stands at the periphery of that Wordsworthian absolute, the 
voluble pansy, which repeated with endless consuetude the tale/tail of English 
poetry (see Wordsworth). Notwithstanding the inception of em-Byronic 
despair, the purpled glory of Victorian melancholy (Pater), or the contra-
platitudinous pose/prose of Wildean wit, Hesperus continues to glimmer in 
the fiercely contiguous struggle of the opposing spirits of exiled historicism--
those backward-glancing shuttlecocks of modern thought whose stolen gleams 
of tinkling thunder have sublimated the heuristic sublime in a more palatable 
mixture of Angst and joie de vivre. 

If criticism is ever to start or startle the hermeneutic genii from their 
prostration before the faded blooms of prior magnitude, the limpid spirits 
must divest themselves of their too contemJ)orary hang-ups, and loose their 
-auraJ..powers in a recrudescence of divine investiture. 

Or if, as Freud thought, in his Jungian fashion, espression is cathartic of 
an expletive or almost explosive energy, Che complex that besets us remains 
undeciphered in its impenetrable plexus of meaning. The under-play of ludic 
, consciousness (Huizinga) portends no resurgence of metaphysical certitude. 
Much remains to be done. The dispeptic reader· is a Wandering Jew who has 
eaten of the Tree of Knowledge, and finds himself, like Philomela, singing in 
the wood. Lacan or Derrida? If hermeneutics is to become Hermetics, the 
Seraphic fire must surely burn on another altar. And the altar /alternation of 
our too wavering faith must now reside (if Peguy is right) in the equilibria of 
stable alternatives. 

The ontological imperative. The formalist critique deepened, but did not 
dispense, with the already transmogrified division of imaginative structures. 
Surely the Stevensian cry, plucked on the violet strings of uncertain existense, 
was a challenge, never met, to our vilified language. And yet the Miltonic 
bequest must, too, demand our ear (as early, unencumbered, pristine 
verisimilitude)-such angelic strictures as it would not be wise to ignore. I 
would assert, nevertheless, that the compromise (or rather surmise) of 
Blanchot is unacceptable (see his Etudes Pitiables, p. 213). Deliquesence is 
not true quiescence. 

Against this too vapid matrix of neo-Kantian insipidities, I have argued a 
reductio, but not, I hope, ad absurdum. Since the strange is never strange 
enough, until it becomes the primal estrangement, the Coleridgean caveat 
needs some revision. The langue that is out on parole arouses more suspicion 
than once it did. The Heavenly Hosts look more and more like the Assyrian 
hordes. And Rintrah, who may well be the final permutation of the displaced 
Chronos, now beats a sadder measure of hyperbolic, yet Hyperborean 
despair. 

0 Time! 0 Tempus! The Romantics found in the Odic 01 a noose to 
encircle the vacuous core of a felt Kierkegaardian dread (see Kierkegaard). If 
I am not to be consumed by my own presumption, perhaps I had better offer 
a similar stop-gap with which to plug such dangerous perforations of soul. 
The critical rhythms to which I have henceforth alluded are rootedly 
libidinous, manifestly so. All redaction is reduction, a tertiary defense against 
the originally erected text (see Freud again). And yet ... and yet, are they, in 
fact, no also pseudo-mystical extractions or even extrications from the · 
ravelled unfoldings of incarnate palaver? To explicate or haruspicate those 
astral imaginings ... though the hip aesthetic, of qualified purport and 
perhaps even out of joint, would carry us away in the whirlwind of 
unmaking. RHke does not abide, and Mr. Kurtz-he dead.
