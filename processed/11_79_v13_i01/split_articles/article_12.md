The Thope Stops Here: An Interview with Jacques Derrida 
Jacques Derrida has been caUed a lot of names. 
Subversive. Deconstructionist. Gallic linguistifier, 
emphasis on gall. He caUs himself, quite simply, a 
professor of philosophy, and he is, in fact, a 
maitre assistant of philosophy at L 'Ecole Normale 
Superieure in Paris, and has been a visiting 
professor at Yale for four years now. But he is 
more than a collection of names. 

Consider a statement made not long ago in a 
discussion section of HAL 36Sa (Modernism and 
Modernity). The reading for the week was a 
se.!Ullent. of Derrida's boolf. Of Grammatolozy 
After an hour and a half of near yelling and · 
violent interruptions and disagreements, the T.A. 
concluded by saying that in one sense, the entire 
course was expressly directed against a Derridean 
way of reading. "That reading," he said, "is a 
subversion of the entire tradition of Western 
metaphysics." 

Or, consider a professor who says, "A lot of 
people would rightfully argue that this way of 
reading just should not be taught to 
undergraduates." This way of reading, which 
seems peculiarly resistant to definition, is 
sometimes called "deconstruction," but that, too, 
is just a name. And a collection of names hardly 
provokes such responses. 

Derrida himself was at Yale this fall, offering a 
seminar on translation, and when we go to 
Trumbull to ask him about his way of reading, he 
seems a contradiction of all that has been said 
about him. His speech is neither vehement nor 
flip, though perhaps characteristically, he begins 
by saying, "You know, I'm not used to giving 
interviews-the interview is a very problematic 
form." And yet, he tries hard to be thoughtful 
about our questions, qualifying his answers as he 
goes, occasionally asking if they are appropriate 
for an interview. He speaks seriously but with a 
reserved playfulness about his own authority to 
answer our questions. At one point the tape 
recorder breaks. and l ask him if he will wait while 
I fix it. "Oh-don't worry about it," he laughs, 
"just make up what you don't catch." 

When we question him ~bout his way of 
reading, about this thing called deconstruction, he 
becomes evasive, telling us he would be wary 
about the word itself. But he agrees to use it for 
convenience, saying, "There has always been 
deconstruction. It did not begin one day in the 
twentieth century; there is a way of looking at 
Plato as the frrst deconstructor. It is not new-but 
it has always been a threat. There is always a 
permanent threat of deconstruction in every 
structure. It's simply a question of becoming 
aware of it." 

But to become aware of it is not the same as to 
define it, and in this answer, as in the rest of the 
interview, Derrida avoids a direct definition of 
deconstruction. Like his critics, he agrees that 
"deconstruction asks questions about the 
foundations on which traditional classical methods 
are built," at the same time·, it goes further than 
methodology. And perhaps it is because Derrida 
sees deconstruction as a principle inherent in every 
structure rather than as a critical tool that he 
provokes such violent responses in his readers. 

"Deconstruction," he tells us, "has not only to 
do with texts that you find in a library. It cannot 
be reduced to discourse. It is something that 
affects my life, not merely a methodological 
approach. It is a way of doing, of speaking, of 
writing." 

His writing, he explains, grows more and more 
autobiographical, "in a sophisticated sort of way." 
"Indirectly, the problems I write about are the 
problems of my life." He adds, however that 
questions about literature and the philosophical 
problems in literary texts interest him most even 
though he would not caU himself a literary critic. 

In this area, Derrida says deconstruction has 
something to do with seeking out the 
presuppositions in a text. He will not be much 
more explicit, but as Harold Bloom defines it, "to 
deconstruct a poem would mean to uncover

whatever its rhetoricity conveyed, even if the 
poem, the poet, and the tradition of its 
interpretation showed no overt awareness of what 
implicity was revealed by such word-
consciousness ... To deconstruct a poem is to 
indicate the precise location of its figuration of 
doubt, its uncertain notice of the limit where 
persuasion yields to a dance or interplay of 
tropes." That limit might be described as the point 
at which we can no longer control language or be 
sure of what it is doing. 

"Language," Derrida tells us emphatically, "is 
not an instrument, and in that case, I transform 
my own relation to language." With this, he 
suggests that his critical langtiage, like that of the 
poem, contains its own deconstruction, its own 
figuration of doubt, and cannot, therefore, be 
reduced to a technical operation. He is careful to 
remind us again that here, as elsewhere, 
deconstruction is not a universal method, although 
his critics continue to insist it is just that, and so 
to find it reductive. 

Derrida expresses little confidence in this 
perspective, adding that as a key word, as a master 
concept, deconstruction loses interest. He has 
rather to do with a chain of concepts, and says, "I 
pay attention to something not identifiable, to 
heterogeneity, to otherness." Deconstruction, he 
continues, begins, in fact, by taking apart a 
universal language, and must not, in turn, become 
a universal language. 

At the same time, he talks of the importance of 
unity, of tradition, saying that a university, for 
example, relies on programs with unity and has a 
history of fields of study, so that it could not be 
built on the deconstructive enterprise. And 
surprisingly, he speaks of his own place within that 
history, of his rigor as a teacher of a standard 
canon. "I have to take part in the tradition even 
as I question it," he says, but he does not seem 
optimistic about the future of that tradition. Of 
teaching it, he tells us, "Disunity is a condition of 
the work. We are in a critical period, and things 
will not be developing harmoniously." 

He pauses for a moment here, but goes on to 
discuss literary criticism as one disturbing example 
of this disunity: "There is more disunity between 
two critics than between a critic and physicist. It's 
as if they're speaking different languages. The 
homogeneity is terrible. They have different 
presuppostions and it creates a scattering in 
pedagogy. Every scholar has his own code, and it 
makes a Babel tower." One wonders if he is 
referring to the tower at the far end of the Old 
Campus, but anyone who has been reading 
Derrida will know that he could certainly include 
himself in this statement, that he himself has a 
specialized code. 

But disturbing as it may b'e, this coding is 
inherent in the language of literary criticism as 
Derrida sees it. "Literary criticism," he explains, 
"is not a metalinguistic survey of literature. It is 
not an objective discourse. To write criticism is to 
write fiction, for you cannot escape being within 
the field about which you write. This is not a 
triumph; it's a necessity." Such a perspective turns 
a considerable catachresis on the traditional 
concept of literary traditon and on the function of 
language, which in turn, creates a disagreement 
about the object of criticism. What is language? 
What is literature? What is to compare? When 
literary criticism is forced to address these 
questions, it undermines the unity of its object, 
which naturally creates a scattering in pedagogy. 

When we asked him if this kind of a crisis has 
any effect beyond the walls of the university, his 
response is immediate: ''The university is not an 
island. It's important to work within the academy, 
although what happens there is chiefly important 
in scientific and technical areas. What we do in 
other fields certainly affects the inside of the 
university, but also the ideological issues of the 
country. Yet these effects remain very indirect and 
potential, and perhaps unclear." 

To talk about the effects of literary criticism is, 
in one way, to talk about our relationship to 
literature, and n~ the end of the interview, we 
ask Derrida why in a broad sense he thinks we 
need to read literature. ·He laughs softly and 
repeats the qu~tion twice before looking up at us. 
When he does look up, he answers with an amused 
question about what we mean by literature, and 
adds, "You know, literature is a recent event, a 
Western adventure begun in the 18th century. Do 
you mean Western literature, or perhaps you mean 
all written texts?" Again he is being playful, 
evading the question, but he soon returns to it: 
"Why do we read? I have no serious answer to 
that. But I think it must be asked seriously. Our 
motivations and desires always differ. Why do we 
read fictions or poetry? I try to ask that question 
innocently of myself. But I'm not sure 1 need 
reading. Sometimes I have the impression it's 
something superfluous. It's not useful, but at the 
same time, it's vital." 

Of his own reading habits he is even more 
skeptical, and when we ask him if there have been 
any particularly influential authors for him, he 
remarks that he is a little old to remember. 
"Besides," he says, I'm not a massive reader 
anyway. My way of reading is very active and 
discontinuous, a violent way of reading. I'm not 
satisfied with that though. I feel guilty about it 
sometimes because sometimes reading should be 
more passive." He looks at us apologetically and 
then smiles waving his hand. "But I'm not passive 
about it. I exploit the book, eat the book, 
extracting little by little. I read to write-it's 
related to my project." 

By now we have been talking for a little over an 
hour, and as Derrida f'mishes speaking, it seems 
difficult to imagine him any longer as a collection 
of names. In fact we have even seen him jogging 
through the Grove Street cemetary in Yale sweats, 
and as we stand to leave we ask him how far he 
goes. For a last time, he smiles, and says, "Yes a 
graduate student friend of mine here got me 
started when I f'rrst came to Yale. He said it was a 
good thing to do. But I don't run a certain 
distance, just for a certain time. I've improved, 
too, since I first started. I'm going for twenty 
minutes now and I couldn't do that before." He 
suddenly catches himself and says, "Wait. Are you 
going to use this for your interview? Well, if you 
do, you can tell people I intend to go further." 

We suspect he was not just talking about his 
jogging.
