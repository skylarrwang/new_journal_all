6. We're Invulnerable! 
Hunter Prillaman, 1980 
and Scott MacCiarty, 1980 
We're invulnerable! And nothing 
seems to hurt us! 
We're invulnerable! Our luck won't 
desert us! 
As we roll down the field, the 
awesome force we wield 
Will make the Crimson yield! We're 
invulnerable I 
We're unbeatable! Even though they 
are persistent! 
We're unbeatable! Their score is 
non-existant I 
Our team will never fail, we'U kick 
poor Harvard's tail; 
It's aU for Eli Yale! We're unbeatable! 
We're invincible! We do it all for Eli! 
We're invincible! In a massacre like 
My Lai! 
The other team is weak, Their 
Quarterback's a freak; 
They're really up shit creek! We're 
invincible! 

The unrestrained joy and exultation of these 
songs reflect the lighter side of the martial 
tradition. There is no hint here of the strife of 
"Smash! Bang! Crash!" or the terror of "The Big 
Blue Wave." Rather we find the same celebratory 
spirit that characterizes such works as the French 
Arc de Triomphe or Beethoven's Emperor 
concerto. It is ironic that Mr. Zurier should choose 
the title "Bulldog Blues" for his song; the spirit of 
his jubilant lines is the exact opposite of the blues. 
Mr. Zurier establishes the metaphor of political 
rule with such phrases as .. the Eli Nation" and 
"establish domination;" his use of "the good 
years" suggests the idea of a golden age, a Pax 
Romana, in which the dynasty is young and 
flourishing. One is tempted to see behind this 
poem the political philosophy of Hobbes or 
Machiavelli, who felt that the security and 
prosperity of the state were the primary requisites 
for the happiness of the citizens. Mr. MacClary 
and Mr. Prillaman make a bold venture with their 
"We're lnvulnerable"-combining the gravity and 
might of martial poetry with the whimsy of Ogden 
Nashian rhymes. The humor does not, however, 
distract us from the main theme; it serves rather to 
instill the poem with the same heartfelt joy that 
. comes with being 'invulnerable'. Needless to say, 
the Eli-My Lai rhyme in the last stanza took 
reckless daring on the part of the authors but, 
provided the public interest groups are not too 
offended, I think they carry it off.

Steve Hayes, 198/ 
Tonight we'll raise a cup at Mory's! 
Tonight the band will play! 
Tonight we'll sing the glories of the game we 
won today! 
Tonight the Elis will be marching 
Up the old Blue victory trail; 
Today we'll faghtl Fight! Fight! And then 
tonight, 
Chalk up another win for Mother Yale! 

7. 0 DIBhle 
by Phil Kushner 
With Autumn breezes blowing, we 
march to Yale's Bowl; 
All minds are set on victory, all 
hearts are on one goal; 
For Eli's sons and daughters, we vow 
we shall not fail 
To fight with all our might for 
.a:>untry, God and Yale. 
REFRAIN: 
And as the Yale men take the fldd 
Our honor to defend 
0 Eli blue, dear Bulldog blue 
We're with you to the end. 
1be years they come and go, and 
nothing stays the same, 
But one proud banner waves in honor 
of the name 
Of men who shook the field and 
fought for Mother Yale, 
Who stopped the Crimson tide and 
pulled the Tiger's tail. 
A hush is on Old Campus; the 
classrooms are all bare; 
The library is quiet, it seems no 
one is there; 
Where are the eager students, young 
scholars bent on fame? 
They've thrown away their books 
and gone to see the game. 

I find this song remarkable for the lyrlcal , 
almost haunting way in which they deal with the 
theme of battle. This is accomplished with the use 
of a shift in focus, a device which is used 
extensively in Homer: the narrative leaves the plain 
of war and travels to a more peaceful scene on 
Mount Olympus or inside Troy. The sudden 
stillness, the remoteness of the clamor of armies, 
creates an eerie melancholy in the reader; the 
importance of military contest seems somehow 
altered within a different context. 

Mr. Hayes' work presents the viewpoint of a 
contestant looking forward to the celebration after 
the victory. The speaker seems to be lost in 
reverie, and is almost unaware of present time· his 
b 
"fi 
' 
a rupt 
•ghtl fight! fight!" is spoken as if to 
remind himself that there is still arduous work to 
be done. The poem has very much the quality of a 
daydream, weaving an enchantment around us as 
we read, similar to that of Shakespeare's 
incantation: "When the burly-burly's done, when 
the battle's lost-and won ... " The more 
concrete aspects of warfare are cast aside for the 
sake of a greater vision. 

Mr. Kushner's work has a similar quality of 
enchantment about it. Although the battle is just 
about to be joined, the poet's mind wanders over a 
wide range of other thoughts: the breezes of 
Autumn, the ceaseless cycle of change, and the 
remembrance of past glory. Finally we are 
presented with an unusually sombre image of the 
deserted main campus. The reader is left on a 
wistful final note that helps emphasize the 
grandeur of the contest about to take place, yet at 
the same time joins it with its eventual passage 
into oblivion through the victory of Time. It was 
in the same tones that Shelley wrote of the 
monumental statue of the ancient King 
Ozymandias: "And on the pedestal these words 
appear:/ 'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:/. 
Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!'/ 
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay/ Of that 
colossal wreck, boundless and bare/ The lone and 
level sands stretch far away." 

7. Yale's Got 
Hunter Prillaman, /980 
Harvard men have higher S.A.T. 's, 
And the Princeton campus has a lot of 
trees. 
Dartmouth men know about the birds 
and bees, 
and UConn players know their ABC's. 
REFRAIN 
But Yale's got a better football team! 
Yale's got a better football team! 
And we know it's all that matters. 
Columbia has New York to walk around 
And there must be something wonderful, 
at Brown. 
It's not too bad at Penn and Cornell, 
And they all give poor Yale a lot of hell. 
But Yale's got a better football team, 
etc. 

Once again, Prillaman's lighthearted approach 
to bis subject is refreshingly unique. He employs a 
format that is familiar enough: that of cataloguing 
the names of his opponents. Witness this eumple 
of Sir Walter Scott's: 

Proudly our pibroch has thrilled in Glen 
Fruin 
And Bannochar's groans to our slogan 
replied; 
Glen Luss and Ross-dhu, they are 
smoking in ruin, 
And the best of Loch Lomon lie dead 
on her side 
Widow and Saxon Maid 
Long shall lament our raid 
Think of Clan-Alpine with fear and 
with woe; 
Lennox and Leven-glen 
Shake when they hear again, 
" Roderick vich-Alpine dhu, hoi 
iero!" 

Prillaman's daring innovation is to make 
concessions to each of the opponents rather than 
vaunting it over them. This serves to build up 
tension, perhaps even outrage, in the reader, until 
the bright resolution of the refrain comes in at 
last. The success of the work hinges on whether or 
not the 'punchline' can make us laugh off or 
forget the self -deprecation that came before. For 
my own part, I believe that Mr. Prillaman can get 
away with any of his concessions, except that of 
the S.A.T. scores to Harvard; there I think he has 
overstepped the boundary of what is acceptable. 

8. Mardi from Yoar hory Towers 
Charles .Baum, 1975 
March from your ivory towers to winning 
fields, 
Show them your mighty strength! Show 
them Yale never yields! 
Play as though all your life hinges on 
winning now, 
Show your aggressiveness! Show them 
that Yale knows how! 
For when you're in the world striving 
for excellence, 
There is no room for soft simpering 
sentiments. 
And when you're at the top, then you 
learn life is cruel, 
And you will face the world fighting 
a constant duel. 
And if this rat-raced pace seems like 
it gets too tough, 
May I say second place isn't quite 
good enough. 
For although Eli's kin may hate the 
world they're in, 
Still we will fight to prove that dear 
old Yale will win. 

I offer this poem last as a imal salute to the 
magnificence of martial poetry. Mr. Baum 
addresses far more than the simple question of 
winning and losing; he speaks to the most 
fundamental issues of human existence. The world 
is structured in such a way thal man achieves glory. 
only through suffering and toil; even when he 
reaches the summit he is still beset by strife and 
must struggle constantly to maintain his 
prominence. Yet, the poet implies, this is the most 
admirable way of dealing with the world. To stay 
apart, removed from the arena of strife, is not a 
valid solution; thus we are urged, "march from 
your ivory towers." Nor is it "good enough" to 
accept a secondary position and not face the 
burden of having to fight off constant challenges. 
It is precisely because the competitive nature of life 
is so distasteful that we must reach for victory. 
Only by vanquishing can we overcome the 
harshness of the conditions imposed on us by the 
competitive world; only in triumph do we redeem 
the inherent righteousness and nobility of 
humankind. Indeed, Mr. Baum's last two lines 
strike at the very center of the problem of strife 
and its relationship to victory. From the sphere of 
a world characterized by grief and struggle, the 
warrior can reclaim a share of greatness and 
distinction-but only by taking on more strife. 
Human suffering and toil are redeemed at last in 
the spirit of the contest. Mr. Baum harkens back 
across the ages to his flrst known predecessor, 
Homer, who first set down the idea that: "men 
fight because they are mortal."
