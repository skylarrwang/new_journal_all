confusion I'd forgotten to get rid of it. For all I

will result in as many as hundred corpses littering 
the apartment, and although both produce the 
same nauseating crunch when stepped on, a live 
cockroach that can scuttle out of the way is 
infinitely preferable to a dead one. Boric acid, in 
fact, is the most effective weapon of all. Rather 
than attempting the impossible clean murder, it 
simply banishes the roaches for good, driving them 
away to the neighbors• apartment with a . 
mysterious and disagreeable chemical. Most people 
discover boric acid from hearsay-it's a little too 
weird to be advertised publicly as a roach 
repellent-and discover to their delight that this 
rather common household feature is capable, in 
great enou~h quantities, of working a small 
miracle. Last summer, in a somewhat cynical 
response to what we'd dismissed as an old wive's 
tale, my roommate and I decided to try it. I 
bought the largest jar of boric acic I could find 
(carefully avoiding the eye of the pharmacist, who 
evidently was vastly amused) and poured spoonfuls 
of it all over the apartment. Pretty soon there was

The Roach in the Big Apple. 
-Martha Hollander 
Without a doubt the most traditional, if not 
legendary, aspect of apartment life in New York is 
the cockroach problem. Learning to live with 
cockroaches should by no means be at the top of 
one's priorities, at lenst nui: before doublelocking 
the doors or fmding out where to put the garbage 
once a week, but it is nonetheless an ongoing 
process: by turns a tedious chore, an outright 
battle or even a source of great personal agony, 
very much like one's relationship with the 
landlord. In fact, the very mention of the word 
"cockroach .. evokes a series of hard-and-fast 
images associated exclusiv~Cw Ymk; 
though it's hardly the only city with this problem 
many of its inhabitants, with true urban 
' 
provincialism, are ready to swear that it is or 
might as well be. No matter how slick and modern 
the apartment (houses don't count really), no 
matter how beautiful the surrounding 
neighborhood, the cockroaches will be there. 

I, for one hate cockroaches. I hate all insects 
with a passion bordering on paranoia, but 
cockroaches are the worst offenders. Even though 
I consider myself a hardened city-dweller in other 
respects (l think nothing, for example, of the 
groggy dope-pushers who sleep on my front 
stoop), roaches are anathema, my downfall. The 
frrst time I ever saw one was my first summer in 
New York; I was an innocent eight-year-old, fresh 
from an idyllic life in the suburbs of southern 
England and quite unprepared for the change. 

Hanging out around in the kitchen one bright 
sunny day I caught sight of a small brown spot 
shaped a little like a cigar that suddenly darted 
across the counter-a UFO in miniature and twice 
as menacing. "Ugh, what's that?" I screamed. 
"A cockroach," said my mother matter-of-factly, 
disengaging me from the fold of her skirt where 
I'd hidden in terror. "They live here too." "You 
mean there's more than one?" She nodded and 
went on chopping vegetables, apparently unaware 
of the catastrophe I'd discovered only too quickly. 
There were lots of them. They could reproduce. 
And they lived here t,po. Suddenly I seemed to see 
them everywhere, on the walls, in the drain along 
the moldings, under the furniture. It was a severe 
culture-shock from which I never quite recovered,

it left the glamorous image of my home town 
permanently tainted. 

Objectively speaking, if that's possible when 
dealing with such a sensitive subject-1 suppose 
there's nothing really so awful about them; they 
are harmless enough little things who dully mind 
their own business, and as long as they aren't 
mistaken for grease-spots or stray Brazil nuts 
everything can be relatively peaceful. The real 
trouble comes in realizing that their presence 
implies contamination. Once the idea that 
cockroaches mean dirt comes to mind. it's 
impossible to forget, and immediately unbearable 
filth, fatal disease and eventual immersion in a 
quivering horde of beetles seem distinct and 
awesome possibilities. A single cockroach in the 
bathroom, bedroom, or anywhere other than the 
kitchen is the frrst sign of inexorable decay: you 
know your apartment is going to seed and 
presuDtably you will soon follow. The frrst time I 
found o~e in my bed I Jet out a tin-whistle shriek, 
fled to my roommate's spare cot and pulled the 
covers up in a protective cocoon. I was safe and

The other chief reason for the ugly mystique of 
cockroaches is that they're rather difficult to kill. 
Casual swatting with a rolled-up newspaper may 
work fme for mosquitoes and big flies, but not for 
cockroaches: they show a remarkable and 
frightening ability to survive even the most 
powerful blows. Flushing them in the ·toilet after 
wrapping them gingerly in tissue paper is also a 
bad idea because, horribly, they just crawl out 
again. I made this mistake once and for weeks was 
tortured with visions of an entire roach-colony

Apart from the telltale white line of boric acid 
users, the symptoms of the cockroach problem, or 
at least a cockroach-sighting, are generally 
manifested in one's personal style. Some scream 
and run, others look grim, roll up their sletves and 
search (foolishly) for a rolled-up newspaper, and a 
few real heroes crush the insect with their very 
fmgers without a pause in the conversation. My 
own tendency is to stand in a comer quaking and 
gibbering until someone elso takes care of it. In 
the meantime, the roaches go right on living there 
too, exploring and reproducing. "You fool," my 
patient roommate once said to me, "don't you 
know what happens if you don't kill cockroaches? 
They crawl behind the stove and make little 
cockroaches." If they stay away from motels, I 
thought, hanging my head in shame; yet nothing· 
would compel me to lift a fmger. I could 
remember a high-school literature class all too 
well, a deeply embarassing experience ever since 
the frrst day when I fainted at p~ one of Kafka's 
metamorphosis. Was Kafka, perhaps, more 
frightened than I? 

They are SO revolting that it's hard to compare 
them accurately with anything else. In a sense, I 
suppose, they are like the most tenacious of 
unwelcome house-guests: they always get to the 
kitchen before you do, frrst thing in the morning; 
they stubbornly ignore hints about leaving some 
day; they scurry away in guilt if you catch them 
where they shouldn't be; then suddenly they tum 
familiar, gross and aggressive and crawl into bed 
with you. Above all, to those who aren't afflicted 
with my particular phobia, they make life irritating 
rather than tragic, like a chronic dull pain for 
which there simply isn't a cure. There are better 
topics of conversation, better ways of spending a 
quiet Sunday v,ftemoon than shuffling around on 
all fours, br~dishing an old shoe and shouting, 
"All right, you nasty little buggers, come on out." 

Yet so much of living in New York, eSpeclally in 
the summer, involves just that: we sit about in the 
evening, moodily nursing our third mug of Jack 
Daniels (can't afford shot-glasses), and chatter 
seriously, far too seriously, about our jobs, our 
apartments, very occasionally our senior essays, 
who's sleeping with wbom, and our cockroaches. 
Clearly, there's eno~gh as it is to madden us-why 
not simply eliminate the latter?
