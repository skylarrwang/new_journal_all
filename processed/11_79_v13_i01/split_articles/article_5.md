A n Interview with B.F. Skinner 
B. F. Skinner is a professor of psychology at Harvard. 
A pioneer in the field of behavioral psychology, his 
first popular work was the utopian novel Walden 
Two (1948). During the 'sixties, popular interest in his 
work increased. In 1971, qfter the publication of 
&yond Freedom and DiKnity, Time published a 
cover story on Skinner which concluded that 
.,Skinner's utopian projection is less likely to be a 
blueprint for the Golden Age than for the theory and 
practice of hell." The second volume of Skinner's 
autobiography The Slulping of a Behaviorist was 
published by Knopf this summer. 

DW Why t,lid you write an autobiography? 
BPS My work has been very much 
misunderstood. And I have been misunderstood. 
When I lecture at a university someone is bound to 
say afterwards, "You should do this more often. 
People think of you with two heads or something 
like that. You're really a human being." 
I've tried to show the differ-ent sides of my life 
and particularly the development of my scientific 
work, which was a series of accidents very largely. 
Lucky accidents certainly. It gives a better picture 
of a scientist at work than the philosophers of 
science who reconstruct what goes on in a 
scientific discovery. 
One principle is to tell the story as it happened. 
I'm writing as you'd write a novel. I've avoided 
reading autobiography since I started. I don't want 
to imitate anyone on this. I've just been following 
some principles of what I think a story should be 
rather- than giving it any artistic structure 
too . . . I'm not dressing it up. I'm not putting in 
irrelevant but teasing tension. 

D W 
Were you hoping to correct popular or 
scholarly misunderstanding? 
BPS There's a great deal of very strange 
misunderstanding: 
At a conference in Washington, a man came 
from India and said to me that if I would go to 
India he would give me a hundred human babies 
to study . . . the whole business about the 
daughter- we raised in the SO<alled air crib, that 
she killed herself or became psychotic. I've 
somehow or other- been confused with John B. 
Watson. At one time Watson published a book in 
which he claimed that affection is a very 
danaerous thing and a parent shouldn't show 
affection. He later- on regretted that he ever 
published that.

an attack on my position. They're miles off the 
target because I have never- suggested that type of 
control at aU, though I do raise these questions. 
Burgess said that he and Kubrick wanted to 
demonstrate that violence, if done with a free will, 
was better than being good due to conditioning . 
The violence in Clockwork Orange wasn't due to 
free will. They were high on a drug and were as 
ll)UCh conditioned as they could possibly be. 

How do you view the contro"versy between 
you and Noam Chomsky? 
BFS I am so perfectly confident that my book 
Verbal Behavior is the right way to go about this 
and that Chomsky has kept the linguists from 
discovering it that I don't worry about this issue. 
The curious thing is that Chomsky has tied this 
aU into political and philosophical and ethical 
issues. He now has quo\e 'figured out> that Locke, 
with the idea that you ~ 
learn from experience 
was really the figure bebiri«l.__ the whole Industrial 
Revolution and capitalism. ~t that's absurd 
-beaiuse that is an environmentaijst approach and 
it is the Descartes kind of inborn lnt,elligence which 
is the belief that people are as they are- they're 
bright or not bright-because they are born that 
way. He's really on the wrong side of the fence 
because according to Locke anyone can become a 
genius if he just has enough experience wher-eas 
according to Descartes you're licked at the start. 
You have inborn rules according to Chomsky, but 
you have only what you got with your genes. 
He should be on Jensens side completely. I 
don't understand this at aU. 
I am, naturally, as John B. Watson was, an 
environmentalist. Watson exaggerated, he said, 
"Give me a dozen infants and I can make them 
into a doctor, lawyer- and so on. He couldn't do 
that, of course. He said right away, "I am 
exagerating and I know it." 
1 C:lon·t tJUnk very well about the so<alled 
'genetic endowment' of the human organism. My 
specialty, and I don't want to try and talk outside 
my specialty, is to discover what. can be done with 
an organism. It might be a human being, it might 
be a pigeon, it might be a raccoon. We have in the 
last thirty or forty years, made extraordinary 
progress in shaping new types of behavior, and in 
maintaining behavior in strength (what's usually 
called 'motivation'). 

D W Do you still believe, as you suggested in 
Walden Two, that the family is becoming 
obsolete? 
••••••••••••••••••••••••blaming the whole thing on me. 
Both Kubrick and Burgess have said that it was 
BFS As SOciety has evolved, you have families, 
and it has been extremely important for the 
protection of children and later for the 
conservation of property, to respect family 
relationships. But we've now reached the point 
where about half the families are only one parent 
families. It presumably is possible to raise children 
more effectively if you know something about it.

human babies to study. 
spent 
my Ufe finding alternatives to 
punishment and yet because I talk about control, 
they think I mean the whip. I tt}ink people are 
controlled and I want to make sure that that 
control works for the betterment of the individual 
and of the species as well. All my work in 
education and elsewher-e has been to_ get rid of not 
only the paddle and the birch rod but aU of the 
subtle ways in which teachers punish students. 
Although I may have coined the word "behavior 
modification" (I'm not sure of that) I don't mean 
implanted electrOdes or vomit therapy. When 
Clockwork Orange came out, I was in London and 
some underground magazine there bad an iSSlJe 

The textbook doesn't come with the baby. An 
ordinary small apartment with two parents and 
two kids is a very difficult sort of situation. With 
a differ-ent organization to society as a whole, the 
old styl~ _family would not any longer be needed. 

Do you think that parental instincts are too 
weak to determine much behavior, or that some 
instinctive tendencies are strong but should be 
replaced by learned behavior? 
. 
BFS We have got rid of most of our instinctive 
behavior because we have ~telligenC! to take its place. 
Personal relationships however, are things which 
remain constant for thousands and thousands of 
gener-ations. The only feature of the human 
environment today that resembles that of twenty 
thousand years ago is other- people. That is 
constant, so that instinctive behavior which deals 
with other people bas a chance to survive. Love 
relationships, caring relationships, could well have 
a measure of phylogenetic character in them. That 
would apply only wher-e the environment is stable 
from generation to generation and would involve 
mostly other people. Care of a child, mother 
embracing a child at her breast could be quite 
..• 
strong for merely phylogentic reasons and yet 
would not necessarily be strong enough to keep the 
mother nursing unless the culture wer-e doing a 
great deal more, showing her how and criticizing 
her if she dido 't. 
It would be'true of lovemaking, different ways 
of making love. All the taboos would probably be 
cultural and would then modify the way the thing 
was carried on. 

Do you have any general views about the 
importance or unimportance of genetic factors in 
determining human differences? 
BFS I differ with my friend E. 0. Wilson and 
the soc'obiologists. I don't think that the notion of 
~iC?logical restraints is anything like as powerful as 
he thinks. It is true that one cannot learn to play 
the piano without the genetic ability to move the 
fmgers but that doesn't mean that ther-e is 
anything fundamentally genetic about learning to 
play the piano. People have invented and produced 
pianos because certain kinds of noises are 
reinforcing. Now that is genetic, I am sure, in very 
obscure way. 
Without a body we wouldn't have behavior. If 
you're going to teach a roomful of children you 
must be sure that they h<ave eyes and ears, you 
must be sure that they have fingers but aside from 
that, what they're taught and bow well they learn 
and how fast they learn are pretty much a matter-
of the environment. There are limitations: There 
are retarded children who do not learn at the same 
speed. You accept these and deal with them as you 
can. Even so they can do much more than most 
people think they can. 
I-think there are important differences among 
people. I think it's absurd to suppose that 
everyone can profit from a Yale education. and
