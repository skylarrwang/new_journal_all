it's absurd to suppose that everyone could ·be a 
concert pianist. I couldn't be. I can't memorize 
music. My eyes have gone bad and I can't read 
music. Since I can't memorize, I can't play and it's 
a great tragedy to me. There's no way in which I 
could ever have, no matter how I had been 
trained as a child. 

I don't feel inferior. I don't feel I should be 
bussed to another school. I don't resent being 
unequal. I wish I could do it, but I do other 
things. 

Any prejudice against any group-blacks, 
Asians, homosexuals-is very unfortunate. Youjudge 
people in terms of their ability and what they can 
contribute. But to do the other thing around-to 
say you ought to give them an exceptional 
chance-is the same principle. You are again 
showing some kind of prejudice. This is the Bakke 
case. I haven't made up my mind on that. 

The only strong issue that I do anything 
about-and it's just a question of where I put my 
United Fund money instead of the United 
Fund-is population. I think the great problem in 
the world today is overpopulation. 

These Boat People: that's a population problem. 
I see no alternative to a lifeboat ethic on this. You 
cannot sink the boat because you felt unhappy 
about cracking someone's knuckles when he grabs 
onto the ed~e. 

My book Beyond Freedom and Dignity, 
came at the watershed between the huge 
individualism of the sixties and the tapering 
of that in the seventies. We must look to the 
future of the species and meanwhile the 
future ways of life which we think are 
promising ways of life with respect to 
preserving the species. 

That's the point of the work 'beyond' in my 
title. I wasn't saying "down with freedom and 
down with dignity." I want people to feel 
freer than ever before, to have a sense of 
dignity and a sense of achievement. 

DW Was it intended os a provocative title? 
BFS Yes. It may have been a mistake, I 
don't know. It sold a lot of books. Actually I 
was calling it "Freedom and Dignity" right up 
until I sent it off to the publishers, and my 
editor then said, "Look, when you get 
through with this, it isn't really freedom and 
dignity we're talking about," and I said, 
"Let's call it Beyond Freedom and Dignity." 

I was thinking of Nietzsche's Beyond Good 
and /!:vi/ and Freud's IJeyond the Pleasure 
Principle. So 'beyond • got in there and it did 
cause trouble, but it also pulled people up 
short so they started to think about this 
issue. 

I am really very unhappy about the 
extension of the notion of individual right at 
the present time.You aren't born with rights. 
You're born with the power to get what you can 
and defend yourself. When you use "rights" 
you're talking about really what you can do. You 
organize and strengthen the workers against 
management and capital and you create rights. 
There is no such thing as a "right," it doesn't 
exist, it has no physical dimensions at all. It has to 
do with the way people control each other and 
particularly the countercontrols of people who are 
controlling in undesirable ways. 

People talk about the rights of animals now; the 
next thing is going to be the rights of plants. 
breakfast. Now, someone's going to say, "Ah, but 
these people have a right to food, to clothing, to 
privacy, to entertainment. You can't take those

rights away to use them as reinforcers." The 
American Civil Liberties Union is after this. 
They're tryng to establish the principle that 
anything that a retarded or a psychotic person or a 
prisoner has had the right to cannot be taken away 
from him to use as a reinforcer. 

Now what does that right mean? Why does a 
prisoner have any rights? You can work up a lot 
of rhetoric for this. You must help the helpless but 
if any person can help themself, he or she must be 
required to do so. A home for retarded people 
which was entirely self-supporting would be ideal. 

DW Is it compatible with your analysis in Verbal 
Behavior to suppose that some gromotico/ 
structures ore innate? 
BFS No. You can't plead genetic sources unless 
you can give some potent reason how they could 
have arisen. People have been speaking languages 
only for, let us say twenty thousand years. Now, 
how important to the survival of the individual to 
breeding age is speaking grammaticaJly? In a few 
generations you can develop resistance to a 
disease-that's crucial. But there is nothing very 
crucial about speaking either broken English or 
good English. 

I think Chomsky backed down on this and said, 
"Well, grammar isn't exactly verbal. It's other 
intellectual things which have had a chance to 
develop before we're talking about the actual 
linguistic environment." 

The argument that all languages have some 
common features and that, therefore, there must 
be some structural principle due to the genetics of 
the individual, is wrong. The innate grammatical 
rules are due to the fact that all languages serve 
similiar functions. In every language people caJl 
the other person by name: "Ah, vocatives." They 
you name the principles and turn arounu ana 
explain the behavior. If, for example, you glimpse 
a circle and it's broken, but you see it as a whole 
circle, that's called 'closure' or 'pregnance' or 
something. Then you say, "Why do you see it that 
way?" "Oh; because of pregnancel" This is just 
double talk. You can do the same thing with 
language. You can extract grammatical principles, 
as the Greeks did when they frrst discovered 
grammar, and you say, "Well, why do people 
speak grammaticaJly? Because they know these 
principles." That's not true. 

If I have a dog I can teach the dog to catch a 
ball or a frisbee. Now this does not mean that the 
dog has deduced the laws of trajectories. Yet he 
acts as if he knew the rules. People speak 
grammaticaJly who don't know the rules. The 
ordinary Frenchman doesn't even know how to 
break the thing up into words. After you extract 
the rules then you can speak according to the 
rules. 

DW So how· do you explain the universality of 
those difficult transformations? · 
BFS I don't know this transformation business at 
all. I would have to take them one by one, I 
suppose, and make a guess as to the common 
features of the verbal environment that would 
make this possible. 

DW Hove you revised your views on physiology? 
BFS I am not anti-psysiological. Many people 
misunderstood me on this. I think it's a fine field 
and an important field. 

The textbook doesn't come with the baby 
name objects: "Ah, nouns." They talk about 
action: "Ah, verbs." They ask questions: "Ah, 
the interrogative." They express wishes: "Ah, the 
optative." All languages are used for certain 
practical purposes and hence they all have certain 
common features. Not because they are part of the 
genetic endowment but because they are part of 
the verbal environment. 

D W 
There ore certain transformations, common 
td all languages, that seem to defy explanations of 
this kind, for instance. the rule that 'which • clause 
cannot be moved to some positions where they 
seem to make sense. How do you deal with these? 
BFS Chomsky is of course a structuralist. This · 
all goes back to Roman Jakobson, Levi-Strauss 
and linguistics and anthropology. 

Jakobson himself has done the most absurd 
thing in analyzing structure. He's taken a 
Shakespeare sonnet and he talks about the 
What I was objecting to was the psysiology 
which is merely inferences from behavior, as if you 
could tum around and use this to explain the 
behavior. It throws light on relationship between 
psysiology and behavior, yes. 

Does psysiology provide hypotheses about 
behavior, os in Garcia's experiments? 
{Garcio.showed that rots will refuse to eat food of 
certain color if they ore i"odioted 4-6 hours after 
eating that food.) 
BFS That is not reinforcement, it is punishment. 
It works precisely as I analyzed punishment. It 
doesn't suppress it, it gives you reasons to get 
apy from it.

Im' Haven't we used physiology to produce on 
hypothesis? 
There is not a world of experience. There is a world, 
BFS But you see, we don't know anything about 
the physiology. All we know is the facts. 

"Something to do with avoiding poison" is an 
appeal to genetics rather than to physiology. 

I would like to see more and more physiology 
done. When someone tells me what's going on 
inside my pigeon I 'II be delighted to hear about it. 
But at the moment I don't know and moreover it's 
going to be harder to fmd out than it is about the 
behavior. 

and there's behavior with respect to that world. 
going to say 
we 
eat 
carrots. I've thought of writing an article, 
"Libertas Nervosa." We've gotten rid of lots of 
the infringements on our freedom that we really 
object to, but we're going on and on. We resent 
every kind of control including those that will keep 
us alive just as the anorexia nervosa case goes 
right o~ down through the normal weight, dying a 
matchstick figure. 

In my own field there has been some work, 
some good and some bad, in hospitals for the 
psychotic and retarded, and in prisons, to use 
positive reinforcement rather than the usual 
'centripedal flow' when you get to the middle and 
the 'centrifugal flow' when you get to the end. Of 
course, every sonnet is centripedal and centrifugal. 
But it's all done (by Jakobson) in terms of that 
particular sonnet. 

The Gestalt Psychologists did this many years 
ago. You discover some structural principles, then 



I don't know of any features of behavior that I 
now understand more clearly because someone has 
told me about the physiology. 

Are there logical problems in explaining 
behavior by events at another level of description. 
like physiology? 
BFS It would be very awkward to do it that way. 
Even though we now know a good deal about 
genetics, you don't really breed a racehorse by 
examining the DNA. you would take the records
