The ltrst poetry of mankind is lost forever in the 
murky eddies. of prehistory; but it probably 
originated, like so much of human culture and 
perhaps even society itself, in warfare. The battle-
cry or paean is certainly a common aspect to of 
war from the very beginnings of history, and it is 
not hard to imagine bands of neolithic warriors 
chanting rhythmic exhortations to one another u 
they aavanced into the fray. The raw might of 
these battlelteld poems was later picked up in parts 
of more civilized works like Homer's /Iliad, in 
which Agamemnon orders: "Let no one escape 
towering doom at our hands, not even the man-
child in his mother's belly!' Since.then, the battle-
cry has been taken up by Greek lyric poets, 
Roman state poets, Galliards, Elizabethans, 
Cavaliers, Romantics-almost every age that has 
sent its youth off to war has produced poetry to 
rally them. 

In the football ltght song we see the modern 
descendant of this ancient literary form. Here, the 
primordial gods of destruction and carnage are 
raised up anew. Once again the martial rhythms 
sound their sonorous beat, and the cry for battle Â· 
and conquest goes up from the host. Students and 
alumni who ten years ago might have been 
Conscientious Objectors and voted for Eugene 
McCarthy can be heard in today's football arenas 
calling out for blood.
