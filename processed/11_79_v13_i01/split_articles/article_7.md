I'll Take Manhattan 
-Eleanor Roberts 
About New York, Joan Didion wrote that 
"those days before I knew the names of all the 
bridges were happier than the ones that came 
later.'' After a year, I still can't tell the 
Triborough from the George Washington. I guess 
that's good. Neither have I ever gone to the Frick, 
MOMA, or the Bronx Zoo, sins of omission so 
shaming I bsually avoid mentioning them. But this 
is about life after Yale, and the untumed comers 
of the city. 

Once you've graduated, New Haven is a lot 
farther away from New York than the all-too-
familiar Conrail for the distance is compounded by 
the feeling that once you've left, you really 
oughn't go back and hang around. Looks like you 
can't make it back from Mother Yale. 

Mother Yale bas quite a stronghold in the city,• 
anyway-few weeks go by without an encounter 
on the street, the subway a shop. 

"Didn't you go to Yale?" Well, yes, but right 
now I'm trying to decide if these plastic wrapped 
tomatoes are ripe. One does run into alot of Yalies 
in New York, doesn't one? 

"Have you been up to New Haven lately?" not 
since graduation. Except once to pick up some 
dry cleaning. 

I forgot to pick up my dry-cleaning in New 
York, too, which means not much has changed, 
right? 

It takes a while for the intellectual and 
emotional sediment to settle after the flurry of 
finals, graduation, moving, job hunting. No doubt 
this process of precipitation is easier for some than 
for others; certainly it's simplified if you know 
what you want, what brought you to New York, 
and where you'll go next. It takes even longer to 
have a feeling of digesting Yale. Heartburn. 
Bluebooks. Yearbooks if it's really bad and 
happens to be raining. 

Yet, my Yale education is paying off. I'm still 
paying Yale off, too, will be for about twenty 
years. But a heartening number of the new old 
Blues I know have found work in their beloved 
humanities. 

Should I update my resume? 

There's some difficulty in reconciling yourself to 
the idea that you're here for awhile, with a job, 
probably a lease, some friends, and it might be 
okay, even a good idea, to go ahead and buy some 
plates, a bed, curtains. After all, taking off for 
parts unknown isn't really imminent, at least not 
on the salary of an editioral assistant. 

Ab, that's a treasured euphemism-the name? 
everything and nothing. Most of all it means the 
landlady won't get the rent until next week. If you 
are planning to be an editorial assistant, choose 
your landlady carefully. 

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, let me count the 
days. La vie quotidienne can be quite a shock 
after those happy golden bygone days. At Frrst you 
just go home and sleep after work, but eventually 
stamina and even affection for office routine 
develop. The worst of times generates the best of 
resigned camaraderie. And then we read statistics 
on the unemployed, the underemployed, and the 
Boat People, and count our blessings. Moreover 
most of us like to work, just not at 9 a.m. And 
anyway we can expect to move on. Nooethdcss I 
Fmd myxlf avoidina acquaintances in Citibank's 
training JX'Oil1Uil, aJt.bougb I reason that I'm 
serving a comparable apprenticeship-which I 
much prefer to sentencing myself to two years of 
law school-it's much harder to predict what I'll 
have to show for it. (They don't give diplomas in 
the school of hard knocks.)

"At least we don't have to worry about getting 
irred," said a woman (Harvard, '78) I work with. 
"Slaves have to be sold." 

A standard job in a standard way in the place of 
your dreams is nevertheless a standard job, nine to 
five, 60 wpm, withholding taxes of a criminal 
nature, and take home wages heading straight into 
your landlady's fist. (1'11 bet her apartment is 
warmer than mine.) There are weeks when you live 
for Friday at 5:00, and hate yourself for it. But 
stiff upper lip, you're a career woman now, don't 
call home collect and for god's sake pay the Con 
Ed bill on time for once. 

home by taxi from their apartments. 

In •COmpensation., however, New York 
neighbors are seldom dull. I have an Intense 
Young Writer from Atlanta downstairs-shades of 
Capote, although Holly Golightly moved out just 
before I got here. Across the hall lives a woman 
who has withdrawn into the spaces of insanity: she 
doesn't go out of her apartment. has her JUOCeries 
(veal cutlets and canned peas) delivered, gets 
everything else by mail (piles of strange packages 
in the downstairs hall), and plays a gruesomely out 
of tune piano at all hours. I suppose she doesn't 
qualify as a true New York crazy, though, since 
she doesn't rant or carry bags around. At least not 
yet. Unable to approach her, I suffer from a 
(probably misplaced) case of sympathy. 

Anyway, it really isn't any colder in my 
apartment than it was in my single last year. And 
there's a great deal of comfort to be found in 
every Sunday night not spent in CCL. 

Cold weather, at any rate, ought to decimate the 
roach population in my kitchen. Sprays don't do 
much. The super does less. Many people here have 
worse New York horror stories to tell-the girl 
who gets electric bills for hundreds of dollars every 
month, though she lives by herself in one room. 
She's ready to blow up the computer, but at least 
they haven't forced her to pay the bill (now in the 
thousands). Then of course there are the weird 
things that happen on the subway, multiple locks 
on the doors. I heard of a Yalie who was mugged, 
and said, frankly, in the face of a knife, "I'm 
sorry, I only have enough money to get by for this 
week." It worked.

Trying to find a place to live in New York is a 
nightmare for which standing in line at Closed 
Reserve in December does not prepare you. I 
asked a friend who is currently looking for an 
apartment to say something funny I could use in 
this piece. "There's nothing funny about looking 
for an apartment," she said. Do not expect much 
help from the legion of agents sprung up in a tight 
market; tell everyone you know and as many 
people whom you don't know who will listen to 
you that you are house hunting. And wait. 

Waiting in line is a way of life here-just 
remindyourselfthat it's not as bad as Russia and 
step right up. Because there are so many lines to 
choose from in New York, one develops decided 
tastes in the 'queues' one Fmds worth standing in. 
I personally refuse to stand in line for two hours 
to see a movie (the entire state of Idaho saw 
"Manhattan" before me), or at the hosiery 
counter at Saks. (This saves me a lot of money.) 
My favorite line is at the bank on Friday at lunch. 
Lunch is the New York power meal, as testified 
by all the mavens at the Four Seasons, 21 Club, 
and other places so exclusive I haven't even heard 
of them. (There is a sign in a dining room of the -

Harvard Club which reads; "An excessive display 
of business papers is prohibited.") One· of the Frrst 
New York expressions you learn is "Let's.have · 
lunch sometime.'' Among non-business 
acquaintances, this phrase leads to meetings with 
people who insist on eating yogurt, to whom you 
have nothing to say across the gap which wasn't 
there the last time you met, in New Haven. Just as 
frequently it simply means, "Let's not have lunch 
sometime. We have nothing to say to each other." 

Sad but true, it requires lots more energy to 
keep up With people in New York than it does in 
New Haven, where a walk across Cross Campus 
brings you to their door. You end up streamlining 
your list of close friends when it costs"SS.OO to get 

Most of the people I know here go out for 
breakfast on the weekends, I think mainly because 
none of us has his own toaster; and it just doesn't 
taste the same if you make it in the oven. I can't 
bring myself to buy a toaster-they're too 
specialized a symbol of domesticity. Never having 
braved the wilds of off-campus life at Yale I have 
found the adjustment to self-sufficiency arduous at 
times. I've stopped eating meat, not out of high 
motives on behalf of innocent cattle, but because it 
is too much trouble, and too expensive. Eggs can 
be eaten in a surprising number of ways. Olive oil 
comes in attractive tins, sponges in day-glo colors. 
Care packages from home are more and more 
infrequent, which is just as W$!ll, I'm a grown-up 
now, after all. Toaster or no. 

Nobody ever said it was going to be easy. The 
suburbs, now, the suburbs are easy. If you live in 
the suburbs, you have a toaster. But the work you 
put into simply living day to day in Manhattan is 
repaid day to day, if you're looking. At its best, 
the city of Broadway is itself something of a 
musical comedy. I wouldn't even be particularly 
surprised, that someone should burst into song and 
a tap dance routine on the comer of Fifth A venue 
and Fifty-Seventh Street. It might even seem a 
sensible reaction, with Indian Summer shining, and 
the mannequins wearing veiled hats and high-
heeled pumps. It would have to be a song about 
love or youth, or New York itself, which has to do 
with both tbose things. Joyful excess-the 
concentration of power and wealth here is heady 
enough to live on (vicariously?) for weeks at a 
time. 

However, still I think I'd like to go to the 
Harvard game this year, and be rowdy at the Bowl . 
again. I thought I'd avoid returning to New Haven

until l could go back to a place once more 
unfamiliar, and see it with new, New York eyes. 
Perhaps that can never happen anyway: it will 
probably never be really new again. More.like 
discovering money in an oid jacket pocket: it's not 
serious money, it's already been spent, and come 
back to you again, free, and you have to go out 
and spend it quickly and heedlessly on something 
unplanned. The currency of New Haven is 
dormant in some pocket, some New York closet; 
it's been spent, but it will come back, free.
