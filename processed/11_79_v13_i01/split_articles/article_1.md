An Interview with Alexander Ginzberg

TNJ: How old were you when you --------
AG: I was ten years old when I 
discovered that there was no notion of 
human rights at all in the Soviet 
Union. I began to express my 
thoughts, and to ask questions, and I 
was told that it was forbidden to speak 
my thoughts and not only forbidden, 
but dangerous. 

TNJ: When you speak of human 
rights, do you refer only to the rights 
of free expression? Or do you include 
economic rights too within your 
tiefiniti_on?

AG: ~ include both kinds of rights. 
ln the Soviet Union, people have no 
right to work-but only the obligation 
to work. They have no right to study, 
but only the obligation to do so. 
There are no such things as rights, no 
such concept, but only things that are 
forbidden or are obligatory. 

TNJ: What about a country where 
there were a few rich people, while the 
majority of people were very poor. 
Would that country be violating the 
human rights of its citizens?

AG: That would depend on the way 
the rich behave towards the poor. If 
the poor received welfare help, if they 
received medical care when they 
needed it, that country might be 
alright. 

TNJ: What about Sexual 
discrimination, the rights of women 
and homosexuals? Are the rights of 
these groups included in your 
definition?

AG: Women, yes. Homosexuals is a 
more difficult question. The 
declaration of human rights can only 
include those rights which don't harm 
others. I spoke at the conference of the 
American Federation of teachers. 
Immediately before I spoke, there was 
a vote to decide whether the teachers 
union should fight for the right of 
homosexuals to teach. There were 
about 800 teachers there and they 
needed a two-thirds majority to pass 
the declaration to fight. To my 
pleasure, they did not get a two-thirds 
majority. They just missed it. I feel 
sorry for a child whose teacher is 
homosexual. 

TNJ: Is the abrogation of human 
rights inherent in a socialist system of 
government?

AG: The utter lack of human rights is 
one of the main points of socialism. 
Under socialism, there is a leveling off 
according to the lowest common 
denominator. The system tells the 
people: there is no need to reach. Let 
everyone be poor. Let everyone be 
stupid. Don't stick out. If you stick 
out, you will be cut off. Show me a 
different kind of socialism. 

TNJ: What do you mean by 
socialism?

AG: I mean a system wherein there is 
no private property and all property is 
controlled by the government. 

TNJ: You would not include Sweden 
then, as a socialist state.

AG: No. Sweden is a welfare state, 
but is is not a socialist state. 

TNJ: Do you think that it is the 
socialist system of government that is 
solely responsible for the eclipse of 
human rights that you speak of, or do 
you think that the emphasis o~ science 
and technology which is pervasive in 
Western societies also endangers 
human rights?

AG: The human spirit does not 
depend on technology. There were, I 
am sure, technological exploits in the 
stone age as well. 

TNJ: Do you think that consumerism, 
and tlie building of a consumer society 
such as we have here in the United 
States, has an adverse effect on human 
rights?

AG: This is not a consumer society. 
Where else but in America does one 
witness so many volunteer 
organizations. I visited such an 
organization, in Washington, the 
Freedom House. In America you have 
voluntary organizations that do many 
things. From such an organization as 
Amnesty International, to 
organizations that teach English to 
black and Indian children. These 
would not exist in a consumer society. 

TNJ: Do you think that there is a 
common ground, a unity in aim or 
approach, among the various dissident 
groups, from Jews to Ukranians, to 
Baptists, to Lithuanians?

A G: I worked on the Helsinki 
monitar with Scharansky, with 
Russians, with Lithuanians, with 
Ukranians and there was no problem 
at alL All of us want to attain 
freedom-not anarchy. Just room to 
breathe. In a totalitarian system, all 
who do not have enough air band 
together. All .of us made it our goal to 
us. 

TNJ: Have the forms of persecution 
in the Soviet Union changed since the 
days of Stalin?

AG: The conditions in the prisons 
have gotten worse. They put in prison 
as many as they have to, as many as 
they can get away with. Now, for 
instance, they will not put Sakhorov in 
prison. They are afraid that scientific 
contacts crucial to their military will be 
interrupted. 

TNJ: Do you feel that anti-semitism 
in the Soviet Union is a major 
problem?

AG: There is anti-semitism because 
the Soviets disapprove of any 
nationalism, of any group that has a 
strong identity and commitment to 
anything besides the state. There is 
anti-semitism, and there is also anti-
Lithuanianism and anti-Ukranianism. 
The J~ws are one percent of the 
population. What about the other 
ninety-nine percent? They are also 
being persecuted. There has been an 
agreement between the United States 
and the Soviet government. It is all 
right for America and the American 
press and politicians to talk about the 
Jews. They have been made into a 
special case, and the Americans and 
Russians will haggle about them. 
The Russian people consider them a 
special case. But all the other groups, 
one is not allowed to speak of them. 
The editors of The Washington Post 
told me that I had space to write a 
column in their editorial section on 
anything that I wanted to. I chose to 
write about the ten thousand Baptists 
who wish to emigrate from the Soviet 
Union. They did not print this. The 
Jews are the only group who it is 
permitted to write about. 

TNJ: Because the Jews own the press?

AG: No, because the Jews can be 
seen as a special case-for better and 
for worse. 

TNJ: What would your advice to 
American students be?

AG: Students are a real force in 
American politics. Ten years ago they 
turned to the left, they stopped the 
Vietnam war-either because they 
thought it was unfair or because they 
did not want to fight. Students can 
cause another turnto. I'm sure you 
have surmised by now that I am a 
reactionary. 

TNJ: Don't you think that American 
students turned to the left because they 
saw their country supporting regimes 
that denied their own people human 
rights, regimes that the American 
government supported for economic 
reasons-South Africa, South Korea, 
South Vietnam, certain Latin 
American regimes?

A G: Have you ever been through a 
war? There can never be full human 
rights during a war, while a war is 
being waged. During the American 
Revolution, there were areas and times 
in which a person could be shot simply 
on suspicion. The situation of South 
Africa, South Korea, South Vietnam 
has been that of a very tense battle. 
Still, millions upon millions more 
people have died as a result of the 
Russian and Chinese revolutions than 
have been affected by these rightist 
regimes. Sixty million people have been 
murdered by the Soviet government 
since the revolution-and this does not 
count war time. Six million people 
have been killed in Communist China. 
The same brutality occurs in any 
country in which such a system is 
introduced. Cuba is a country of one 
million people-<X>unt the victims of 
her system. In East Germany, there 
has been no noticable population 
increase in recent years. This is not 
because they use birth control over 
there, but because they shoot people 
who dissent. 

TNJ: Still, if the American students 
are to support the use of American 
power, acting as a global judge and 
policeman, we have to be sure of the 
morality of those who wield the powe1 
I think many students remained 
unconvinced of the moral fibre of 
those groups which lead our nation.

AG: I must defend America. Who is 
now most involved in saving the 
Vietnamese refugees? Isn't it America 
I know because I have been involved, 
since I left Russia in the movement to 
help the boat people. Those people 
who were against the war in Vietnam 
are not helping the boat people. 

TNJ: That's not exactly true.

AG: Jane Fonda, Daniel Ellsberg, 
Angela Davis-they were asked for 
their help and they refused. I tried to 
arrange a meeting with Jane Fonda 
and Muhammed Ali-they refused to 
meet with me. 

TNJ: Joan Baez , . . 

AG: I have no trouble with Joan 
Baez. At least she has a conscience. 
She learned about the U.S.S.R. while 
visiting there. She was not allowed to 
sing in public. So she came and sang in 
the kitchen of Sakhorov. 

TNJ: Getting back to the question of 
American students-what direction 
would you like their activism to take.

AG: Fmt of all, I wish that they 
would not listen to me, or to anyone 
else. I want them to go and inquire 
and listen and see things with their 
own eyes. You know in Moscow, when 
a visitor comes, they show him 
MQSCOw State University. It is much 
smaller than Yale-and it is for forty 
thousand students. There is no 
freedom for the student. 

TNJ: Does it matter to you that there 
are people living witl}in a few blocks of 
this university who don't have 
adequate places to live or enough to 
eat?

AG: This is true? Of course this 
bothers me. Of course I believe that 
people must take care of one 
another-if I did not believe that I 
would not have been a dissident in the 
Soviet Union. I think that each person 
is responsible to others, and that the 
community and the state is especially 
so. In my country they spit on other 
people. In the Soviet Union, men help 
one another and are put in prison for 
it. 

TNJ: And what wouJd you hke to see 
students doing?

AG: If American students would set 
up a volunteer organization similar to 
the Peace Corps-to the ideal of the 
Peace Corps-I know little of how this 
organization actually worked-a corps 
that would work in China, in the 
U.S.S.R. in Southeast Asia, in Eastern 
Europe, a group that would concern 
itself with human rights-then they 
would help us and our people and they 
would work for peace. Nobody would 
ask such an organization to work 
according to political rules. This 
would not be a government 
organization. I do not want others to 
work for the political goals of 
Alexander Ginsberg. If they will only 
carry on their own ideals.
