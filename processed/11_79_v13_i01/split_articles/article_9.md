Dress Well and bee
For Five Good Reasons 
SCHOOL PRIDE 
Who says smart girls can't 
be beautiful and well-dressed? Lindsay McCrum 
insists they can be. For spending a few quiet 
moments drinking tea and perusing the latest 
Elizabethan Club acquisition, Lindsay likes to 
wear "something long and sparkly: What a great 
thing for our school, if the girls could be visual 
knock-outs, like the buildings." Ms. McCrum 
continues, "Some people may think its snooty, but 
for me, personaJly, it's a way of showing how 
proud I am of this school." 

I'M FEMININE 
"Retaining my 'woman's 
point of view' isn't easy here, I don't care if the 
school is called Mother Yale, â€¢' says Kacey Clagett, 
"that's why I often wear dresses when I come for 
an evening in the Computer Center." Here Kacey 
is shown repairing Gandalf (a computer) and 
wearing roses, silk, and ruffles, at the same time. 
She "came out" in the dress, and her mother 
shortened it for her. 

HELPS ME THINK 
"There's nothing like 
wearing black to the stacks to really psych me up 
for Nietzsche," says Evita Saks, Yale College 
Junior. "I usually study on the 7th floor, York 
Street side, so I can also keep my eye on the action
at Toad's Place." Eva has written 30 papers (and 
none of them were Pass-Fail) in her sophisticated 
outfit of black satin and pearls. She is currently 
planning her senior essay wardrobe. 

VISUAL HAPPINESS 
"If I could have my 
way, badly dressed people would not even be 
allowed into art galleries," says Ella King Torrey, 
Scholar of the House in Art History. "Other 
people's insensitivity to form, line, and color really 
gets on my nerves." Like many scholars in her 
field, Ella believes that Picasso had an innate and 
very special talent for painting. For touching up 
Yale's Collection of Modem Masters she likes to 
wear " a wool hat, but nothing fancy." 

ATTRACI'S mGH CLASS GUYS 
After 
a long day of trying to get a good education, 
there's nothing more relaxing than slipping into a 
tasteful nightgown. Add a tittle perfume and you 
might get invited to a Quaaludes and Sex Party at 
Skull & Bones. "There's usually a fight first, to 
see who gets the President Taft Memorabilia 
Bedroom, but they never hit the girls. The guys are
just the coolest," says Betzyna. "I like to go on 
Monday nights, after Mory's."
