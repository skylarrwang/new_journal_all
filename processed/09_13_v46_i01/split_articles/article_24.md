Hello American #1,341,682,
You may not know me, but I know all 
about you. I’m a data collector for the Na­
tional Security Administration. But don’t 
worry, I’m not here to defend our domes­
tic surveillance program or deny its scope. 
I’ll be the first to admit that we have in­
deed been spying on you. You, personally. 
We have mined your phone records, your 
Google searches, and your direct messages 
on Twitter. We know your favorite YouTube 
videos, and we know which Buzzfeed ar­
ticles you sent around the office with cap­
tions like “LOL SO TRUE.” We have neatly 
collated lists of your most-visited and your 
privately-viewed. We even recorded your 
Bing activity. Unethical? Probably, but I pre­
fer to leave that question to the higher pow­
ers. What I’m here to do is save you from 
yourself.

I’ll start at the beginning. Getting the 
position was thrilling. I mean, data collector! 
I spent most of my time eating kettle corn 
while looking up old acquaintances from 
high school. Sheldon Jackson, for example, 
has gone from being the popular quarter­
back to a sad, sad man whose search his­
tory includes “regrow hair cheap” and “hu­
man hug feeling.” Rita Stinson, salutatorian, 
is now a clean-cut vice president at JPMor­
gan, but her SecondLife avatar has spiked 
purple hair and is a steampunk anarchist 
named “Spleen.” Jenny Grafton seems hap­
pily married, not that I care. Nine of my for­
mer classmates are divorced, three more 
are closeted, and nearly half of them have 
ordered self-help books from Amazon.

In addition to my private snooping, the 
job required me to trek through a never-
ending wasteland of Facebook profiles. It 
seems to me like the sadder people are in 
their real lives, the more they pretend to be 
happy online. My old middle school math 
teacher, for example, is severely in debt—
this I learned from her email correspondence 
with a loan shark named Stinky Pat—but her 
latest status reads, “just bought a BRAND-
NEW bike (talk about a SPLURGE?!) and i 
couldn’t be happier!!!” Really, Ms. Steven­
son? You have twice proposed marriage to 
Stinky Pat. Yesterday you spent six hours 
on Chatroulette, and for two of those hours 
you were the only user who wasn’t just a pe­
nis. Plus, that’s not even your bike in the pic­
ture! It’s your nephew’s. And Mr. Katchmore, 
shame on you for commenting, “can’t wait 
to see it when me + astrid are back from eu­
rope!” You wrote that from your kitchen in 
Hoboken, and Astrid is in a coma—or didn’t 
they teach you not to lie when you became 
a history teacher?

Celebrities, I learned, are especially 
prone to misrepresenting themselves over 
social media. Did you know that George 
Clooney has his hair professionally grayed? 
Or that Lady Gaga spends almost 90 per­
cent of her time in sweatpants stained with 
the tears of oppressed sexual minorities? 
Justin Bieber is actually bald, and Nicki Minaj 
is a five-foot-three Jewish ex-con named 
Moe. All these people, the ones you spend 
so much time watching on television and 
following on Twitter, you probably wouldn’t 
recognize any of them in real life. Example: 
see that pig-tailed girl picking her nose over 
there? That’s Miley Cyrus.

I mentioned that we have neatly collated 
lists of everyone’s most-visited and private­
ly-viewed web pages, and I wasn’t kidding: 
the lists are in three-inch blue binders, along 
with printouts of Google search histories 
and recent text exchanges. I read your sis­
ter’s file earlier today, and there’s some juicy 
stuff in there. (You should ask her: “Elā mīru 
telugu māṭlāḍaṭamu nērcukōlēdu?” That’s 
Telugu for, why did you learn to speak Telu­
gu?) And currently sitting on my desk, this 
moment, as I’m writing this, right in front of 
me? Your binder—your personal NSA life-
file. If I open it, I’ll learn all those small dark 
secret things you’ve tried to hide from ev­
eryone.

But why do you so desperately want 
to hide? When you’re hiding, you’re alone. 
Even when you’re in public, even when 
you’re singing “Superbass” to a sold-out 
arena—because Nicki might look great, but 
Moe is still there, plugging away under a pile 
of fake hair and makeup and clip-on nails, 
and nobody will talk to him about the aes­
thetic purity of Shabbat.

When you’re alone like that, you become 
lonely, and that’s when you order self-help 
books from Amazon and try to elope with 
Stinky Pat and lie about how your wife isn’t 
actually in a coma. You’ll say anything to 
hide your loneliness from others. Eventually, 
you’ll become hidden even from yourself, 
and not even the NSA will be able to find 
you. Which is saying something, because, as 
I mentioned earlier, we have a lot of data.

	
Cheers,
