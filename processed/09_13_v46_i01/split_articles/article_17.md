ended up respecting him. They elected him 
as student body president in his second 
year. 
Yet 
a 
small 
group 
of 
Christian 
fundamentalists—some of his own YDS 
classmates—regularly spoke out against 
homosexuality, calling it a sin and even 
inviting an anti-gay speaker to lecture in the 
Divinity School’s quadrangle. 
“I remember being prayed over by a 
student,” Burl tells me. “She asked if I would 
see the light.”
Burl holds that in the Old Testament, 
even in the Ten Commandments, “there 
are prohibitions against sexual expression. 
But there are never prohibitions against 
love 
or 
commitment.” 
And prohibitions against 
homosexuality, he points 
out, 
come 
alongside 
prohibitions 
against 
eating 
shrimp, 
getting 
a tattoo, and wearing 
clothes of mixed wool and 
linen fibers.
If someone tries to use one of the Old 
Testament passages against him, Burl says, 
he asks them if they are wearing polyester. 
And if they are, “I remind them that they 
should be stoned. And then we discuss the 
absurdity of what they just said. Maybe over 
a nice shrimp dinner.”
He hoped the Mississippi bishop would 
see the issue similarly and recommend him 
following his graduation in 1998. By then, 
the New Jersey bishop had been acquitted; 
the court had ruled that nothing in the 
core doctrine of Episcopalianism barred 
the Church from ordaining a gay or lesbian 
priest. 
Yet when Burl went back to Mississippi, 
the Jackson bishop told him that ordaining a 
gay priest, even then, would be tantamount 
to political suicide in his current position—
one for which he had been elected by a 
largely anti-gay state.
“You’d make a damn fine priest,” he 
remembers the bishop telling him, “but I’m 
not gonna touch you with a ten-foot pole.”
When Burl reflects on that second formal 
reflection, he says, “I felt like I had been let 
down by my own people. I was bitter at the 
church as much as I was bitter at my home 
state.”
But Burl still believed he had a calling, 
and he certainly hadn’t given up on God. He 
moved to Atlanta. There, unlike in Mississippi, 
the bishop allowed gay and lesbian members 
of the Church to be ordained as long as they 
did not have a same-sex partner. 
For a year, Burl hid his sexuality for the 
first time in his life, and never talked about 
his partner, John. It was the first time in his 
life he was forced to be secretive, and it was 
nothing short of psychological torture, he 
says. 
“That was the most wretched and 
damaging year I have ever 
had. It was so incredibly 
cruel. And in the middle of 
it, my partner left me and 
I couldn’t speak about it.” 
Georgia’s 
rejection 
came insidiously and from 
behind closed doors. In the 
end, the church officially 
denied him the position on the grounds 
that he was “arrogant” and “lacked pastoral 
sensibilities.” But at a cocktail party a short 
time later, Burl’s friend heard a different 
reason: “Oh, you know,” a member of the 
Atlanta Ordination Committee reportedly 
said over his drink. “Burl’s just too gay.”
Burl finally gave up. He moved to 
Washington, D.C. He worked at a wine shop 
and a stationery store for a year. He met Bob. 
The ordination process was no longer at the 
front of his mind. After all these setbacks 
and rejections, you might expect some crisis 
of faith, or at least some disillusionment with 
the Episcopalian Church. Yet the Church 
continued to be a home to him.
“That’s the odd thing about me,” Burl 
explains. “I’ve never felt abandoned by God. 
I very often would ask God, ‘Why?’ But, if 
anything, I always found peace and solace 
in my relationship with God.”
Despite the years of hopes followed by 
disappointments, Burl realized that he still 
wanted to be a priest. He just didn’t want 
to go through the ordination process again, 
“I’ve never felt abandoned 
by God. I very often would 
ask God.”

and he never imagined that he would return 
to Atlanta. Burl says, in retrospect, that he 
was running from God’s call.
After six years in D.C. and one in New 
Orleans, he received some unexpected 
news. The Lovett School, in Atlanta, was 
offering him a job. He had good reason to 
believe it was still impossible to become a 
priest there, but before declining the job, 
he decided to check. During his time away, 
the Episcopalian Diocese of Georgia had 
elected a new leader.
Burl decided to pay the new bishop and 
got on a plane to Atlanta. “I said, look, here’s 
the deal. I have been offered a job here, and 
I want to go through the ordination process. 
But I’m openly gay, I’m not making any 
apologies for it, and I have a partner.”
The bishop’s response: “So when are 
you moving?”
Burl was taken aback, and skeptical. 
“I had learned not to trust men in purple 
shirts,” he admits. Despite his mistrust of 
church leadership, he took the new job 
because he felt it was God’s will. He moved 
to Atlanta with Bob, and became my high 
school English teacher.
He was ordained as a deacon in 2011, 
two years later. In 2013, he was ordained 
as a priest. Even after the bishop placed 
his hands on Burl’s head, officially marking 
him a priest in the Episcopalian Church, 
Burl remembers thinking: “Did that really 
happen?” 
Sitting on his porch, I think: surely the 
story can’t end that easily. I feel like one of 
the students at YDS, wondering how Burl has 
survived as a gay priest in the South. But I 
ask him anyway. People in the congregation 
must approach him to argue, to pray for and 
over him?
Burl admits that he has encountered 
quiet resistance. The committee of his local 
parish didn’t come to his ordination, nor 
did they congratulate him. But Burl also 
has other stories. Just this past June, Burl 
says, he was in the lobby of an Episcopalian 
church in Charleston, wearing the collar that 
marks his priesthood, when he happened 
to mention Bob in conversation. A middle-
aged woman in a smart summer top, along 
with her seersucker-suited husband, came 
up to him and said, “I’m sorry, did you 
just say husband?” Burl responded yes, of 
course. Tears appeared in her eyes, and she 
hugged Burl’s neck. “Thank God,” she said. 
“My son is gay. And I needed to hear that.”
After twenty years of church resistance, 
it looks like the South is ready for a priest 
like Burl. “It’s like, what’s the big hairy deal?” 
Burl says, thinking back on all the years he 
spent in the ordination process. “If people 
are so insecure about sexuality and the 
church, then they need to go do their own 
work. Because God has already done his.” 
In Burl’s New Testament class back in high 
school, I didn’t learn what God, Christianity, 
or the Church meant to him, personally. 
Now, hearing the saga of the path to his 
ordination, I have a fuller understanding of 
Burl’s theology, the set of beliefs tying him 
to the institution that nearly destroyed him. 
He tells me that he fundamentally believes 
that, “God is grieved by the faults and 
delineations of human constructs. He only 
desires the happiness of people.”
We’ve been sitting on the porch for two 
hours now, so I finally take him up on that 
lemonade. The rain still hasn’t come.
