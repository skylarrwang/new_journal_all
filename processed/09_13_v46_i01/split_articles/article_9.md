EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
From the Harlem-125th Street Station, it 
was a simple subway ride uptown to Bronx­
works, a community center on the borough’s 
artery, the Grand Concourse. I settled into 
a folding chair in a bright room, facing a 
makeshift stage. A dozen middle-schoolers 
outfitted in matching T-shirts mingled on­
stage, nervous and excited. A tall bald guy, 
intense and energetic, introduced himself 
as a “joker,” or facilitator, and explained to 
the audience that we were “spect-actors,” 
not spectators. Then he urged us to be alert: 
“What’s the thing that makes you angry?”

The students launched into a short play 
based on their own experiences, about start­
ing a girls’ basketball team at their school. 
After they seek guidance from a teacher—
played by a peer of theirs decked out in a 
comically oversized blazer—he tells them 
that they need to fundraise for uniforms and 
equipment. The students are passed from 
one teacher to another, none of whom is 
willing to commit to coaching them. Even­
tually even their principal dismisses their 
idea.
“Who thinks they could change this?” 
the joker asked. Almost everyone around 
me thought they could. An “awww, hell 
yeah,” rose from the audience. We were 
asked to think of a possible solution, then 
share it with the person next to us. “Any­
thing that’s possible in the world is possible 
on this stage,” the joker reminded us.

I turned to the girl next to me, who was 
just a few years younger than the kids on 
stage. But before I could launch into an ex­
planation of Title IX, she pointed and told 
me, with obvious pride, “That’s my brother.”

Here, the idea is that the spect-actors 
belong to the community, and the commu­
nity belongs to the spect-actors. They know 
each other’s experiences and frustrations. 
By naming them, together, they can begin 
to change them. Interrogation leads to in­
vestigation, and then to transformation.

The afternoon’s performance was a for­
mat called “forum theatre,” one of many 
structured activities used by the Theatre of 
the Oppressed, a method developed in the 
seventies by Brazilian actor and artist Au­
gusto Boal. Boal’s project of liberation was 
as simple as it was visionary, creating games 
that take on complex issues like internalized 
oppression and democratic representation. 
“All theatre is necessarily political, because 
all the activities of man are political and 
theatre is one of them,” his manifesto be­
gins. Boal published the book while in exile 
from Brazil, having been arrested, tortured, 
and forced to leave by a military dictator­
ship. Working throughout South America 
with ordinary peasants and workers, he es­
tablished the Center for the Theatre of the 
Oppressed in Rio de Janeiro. The method 
spread through South America, but did not 
stop there, making its way to Europe, New 
York, New Haven, and beyond. 

Theatre of the Oppressed owes its New 
York existence to Katy Rubin, a native of 
New Haven. She grew up in a family of arts 
and activism, and first met Boal when she 
was fifteen. After graduating from the act­
ing conservatory at Boston University, she 
started to study his method more intensive­
ly. While working as a teaching artist in New 
York’s public schools, Rubin noted that in­
teractive art could improve students’ grades 
and behavior. Theatre of the Oppressed, 
she found, could be used to “activate social 
change” and “engage diverse communi­
ties”—but it had yet to come to New York 
City. Now, there are troupes with homeless 
actors, and strangers approach them in sub­
way tunnels to ask, “Weren’t you in that play 
the other day?” Rubin says that power shifts 
when the ostracized are given a voice, and 
can become recognized.


In 2011, Rubin returned to her hometown 
to hold New Haven’s first Theatre of the Op­
pressed training. One of the jokers trained 
there is a woman named Janet Brodie, who 
in her day job coordinates group therapy at 
a mental health clinic on Chapel Street. Bro­
die, who specializes in creative arts therapy, 
finds that the techniques of Theatre of the 
Oppressed “dovetail with the goals of ther­
apy,” helping clients to develop spontaneity 
and relationship skills.

Brodie’s work extends to the wider 
New Haven community. Most recently, she 
has worked on a “Healthy Aging” project, 
a forum theatre group for older people liv­
ing with mental illness. A group of seven 
worked for eight weeks, creating skits and 
spoken word poems, which they performed 
along with forum theatre at local mental 
health facilities and for the local chapter 
of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. 
“Who oppresses?” her notes for the proj­
ect read. “Self,” “police,” “therapist,” par­
ticipants wrote. One added, “I can only go 
so far with the way I am being made invis­
ible.” As the project challenges, it aims to 
empower. A flier for workshop participants 
reassures them, “If you are feeling confused 
in the workshops, it means that the work is 
going well.” 

New Haven is taking the work even 
more into its own hands: jokers will be run­
ning their own training this upcoming Sep­
tember during a weekend’s crash course in 
Theatre of the Oppressed that ends with a 
performance. The project’s organizers hope 
the momentum continues. “It could go a 
million places,” Brodie said.

The New York project’s reach gives an 
idea of just what those million places might 
be. The city’s branch also conducts work­
shops in a Staten Island youth court; at 
the Harvey Milk High School, an alternative 
school for queer youth who have been ha­
rassed at other schools; at Housing Works, 
a center for people experiencing poverty 
and homelessness; in psychiatric hospitals 
and soup kitchens and public schools, with 
refugees, domestic workers, and undocu­
mented immigrants. 

“This is a real story. This is real life,” the 
joker at Bronxworks said at the top of the 
show. It is real life, but it is also a vision of 
a world of reality and possibility, of imagi­
nation and empowerment and fearlessness, 
of spect-actors and jokers, and crowded 
rooms in community centers on sunny 
spring afternoons.
