A Bridgeport zoo adopts an orphaned bobcat kitten.

e meet for the first time in October 
2012, with a set of metal bars 
between us. Safe on our opposite 
sides, we size each other up. BeeZe (rhymes 
with “easy”) blinks first, blandly, which only 
goes to show you the stupidity of a staring 
contest with an opponent who’s indifferent 
to the game. BeeZe has nothing to prove. 
BeeZe is a creature of limitless patience. 
BeeZe has eyes worth a long deep stare: 
hazel-colored and lamp-like, their expression 
lying somewhere between complacence 
and alertness. His gaze flicks between the 
two people on either side of me. The man 
to my left presses his face thrillingly close 
to the cage.
“Hey, big guy,” Gregg Dancho, director of 
Bridgeport’s Beardsley Zoo, says familiarly. 
The big guy blinks again. He also shivers, 
though that may be an illusion caused by 
the breeze rippling over his striated fur. 
“Hey, kitty.”
“Aww, are you chilly?” BeeZe’s trainer, 
Chris Clark, croons. BeeZe does not answer 
her. With a swish of stubby tail, he streaks 
from the raised platform to a lower branch, 
then lands silently on the concrete, lapping 
water from a silver pet bowl.
This is my first encounter with a bobcat, 
and the Beardsley staff claims that this 
bobcat is particularly remarkable. Making 
polite, 
appreciative 
noises, 
I 
respond 
as I often do to acquaintances’ beloved 
pets, enthusiasm masking bemusement 
at what seems to me to be a  weird and 
unfathomable love. At six months old and 
fifteen and a half pounds, BeeZe is roughly 
the size of an impressive housecat—you 
can imagine moving him out of the way 
when you fetch the morning paper, and he 
seems even tamer with a collar around his 
neck. But moving BeeZe anywhere takes 
experience: a quick, sure grab around in just 
the right place around his shoulder-blades, 
so that his mittenishly large paws protect 
you from his bite.
“That’s the physicality we never want 
the public to see,” Clark confides. If people 
catch sight of the zoo staff touching 
BeeZe—whether to correct unruly behavior 
or to provide comfort—they may get the 
wrong idea about how they should behave 
around a wild bobcat.
Right now, relatively few people catch 
a glimpse of BeeZe. Though he is part of 
the zoo’s educational program, he is not 
formally on exhibit. BeeZe has been raised 
in captivity with the goal of making him an 
“animal ambassador” for the Beardsley Zoo. 
While an ambassador’s duties may vary 
across zoos or species, the Beardsley staff 
sums them up as “edutainment”: an animal 
gets trotted out while its keeper explains its 
habits, habitat, and other key facts to the 
audience. Some ambassadors move within 
zoo grounds with a keeper, while others 
visit schools for educational assemblies. 
Others may appear at birthday parties or 
corporate events. Often, the price of the 
“Animal Encounter” escalates with the 
glamour of the animal.
The practice of maintaining off-exhibit 
animal ambassadors is not uncommon, 
especially 
among 
smaller 
institutions. 
The only zoo in the state of Connecticut, 
Beardsley is home to a mere three hundred 
specimens and seventy-five species, and 
has a budget of $3.5 million. BeeZe joins a 
modest diplomatic corps whose mammal 
members are mostly cute and harmless: 
a rabbit, a chinchilla, and a ferret. Yet the 
most significant difference between BeeZe 
and his colleagues is not size or rank on 
the food chain, but origin. The majority 
of Beardsley’s educational animals were 
acquired from former pet owners or from 
professional breeders. BeeZe comes from 
the wild. Now, he makes his home at a zoo 
“He needs to learn that he 
doesn’t want to kill us. ”
