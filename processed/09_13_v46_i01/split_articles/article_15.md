classrooms.” 
Dancho has been employed at the zoo 
since high school, when he completed in-
service training for credit. He eventually 
became a full-time employee, earned a 
master’s degree in zoology, and was named 
the zoo’s director in 1983. Immediately, he 
sought city, state, and private funding for 
major renovations. To Dancho, the turning 
point for the Beardsley Zoo was becoming 
certified by the Association of Zoos and 
Aquariums (AZA) in 1987 for meeting 
its standards for animal care, physical 
facilities, and guest services. He continually 
makes 
reference 
to 
the 
AZA’s 
core 
principles of conservation and education—
an understandable reflex, given that he 
assumed directorship at a time when some 
suggested that the zoo simply be shut down 
altogether. Debate raged in the Hartford 
Courant: was the Beardsley Zoo a hidden 
gem, a Noah’s Ark in the most unlikely of 
cities? Or was it, as detractors claimed, little 
more than a postage stamp collection, a 
peep show of creatures deprived of their 
dignity?
Bound within Plexiglass walls or chain-
link 
fencing, 
today’s 
exhibits 
cheerily 
reenact the fractious overlap of human 
and animal environments. The path to the 
Wolf Observation Viewing Facility crosses 
through a replica of a hunter’s cabin, 
complete with vaguely period lanterns, hay 
bales, and farm tools. The alligator exhibit 
boasts a Southern-style wooden porch 
where the reptiles bask in the sun, right up 
against the glass and inches away from an 
old-fashioned rocking chair. Most of the old-
fashioned cages are gone, and the spaces 
are more expansive. But the architecture 
underscores that, as Head of Education Jim 
Knox puts it, “Wild is a qualified term.”


When I visit in October, the education 
office smells strongly of cat, and for several 
uncomfortable hours I suppress sneezes. As 
a young kitten, BeeZe became something 
of an office fixture, often allowed free reign 
while his trainers did paperwork; he quickly 
settled upon the filing cabinets as a favorite 
perch. By autumn, the need for constant 
proximity to his caretakers had abated, 
and he had grown too active and powerful 
to stay in that environment for long. His 
climbing tower and cage still stand next to 
one desk, and maintenance workers on their 
way to fix the roof peer around the corner 
to ask, “No bobcat today?”
“People have a fascination with cats,” 
explains Knox. He can sympathize: before

coming to work at Beardsley, he was a 
keeper at the Bergen County Zoo in New 
Jersey, where his favorite animals were the 
mountain lions.
“I love those guys.” A boyish, dreamy 
smile spreads across his face. “I just think 
they’re magnificent.” He blinks, clarifying, 
“That’s not a scientific term,” then shrugs. 
“They scare the hell out of me, but I love 
them. It’s a fascination based on respect.”
For some on the fringes, fascination 
can give way to an unreserved and reckless 
infatuation. The Beardsley Zoo often finds 
itself 
fielding 
unsolicited 
“donations” 
from the owners of exotic, illegal, or 
otherwise unmanageable pets: crocodilians, 
unexpectedly large constrictors, venomous 
animals, even primates. More often than not, 
the zoo refuses.
“We don’t want to acquire 
people’s poor choices,” says 
Knox.
Most of the visiting 
public lies on the other 
end of the spectrum. To 
them, nature is something 
that 
exists 
elsewhere. 
Children from surrounding 
Bridgeport 
have 
only 
experienced animals as 
threats: rats, cockroaches, 
tough neighborhood dogs. 
Even suburban kids, who have more access 
to summer camp and scouting, don’t get the 
chance to discover nature in an uninhibited, 
unstructured way. The Beardsley Zoo is 
far from unstructured, but Knox sees it as 
a space where people can begin to forge 
a more ethical relationship to the wild, 
learning about native biodiversity, wildlife 
tolerance, and backyard conservation. In 
some ways, a local animal like BeeZe makes 
for the ideal ambassador.
“BeeZe strikes the balance between 
beautiful and safe,” Knox explains, “He’s not 
intimidating. He’s intelligent. He works well 
with people.”
The bobcat also has what Knox calls 
“charisma,” a term he finds difficult to define 
in an animal. Environmentalists, however, use 
the word with varying levels of irony, even 
dismissal: “charismatic” species, the bald 
eagles and humpback whales of this world, 
excite public response disproportionate 
to their actual ecological importance; at 
the same time, they can be leverage for 
those activists wishing to achieve more 
far-reaching goals. Otherwise, the term 
is often used as a catch-all, describing 
animals that are beautiful, affectionate, 
easily anthropomorphized, or fun to hunt. 
Inevitably, if unconsciously, the concept of 
“charisma” is linked to utility for humans. 
But when Knox talks about BeeZe’s 
charisma, he’s not talking about inter-
species relationships in the abstract. BeeZe’s 
charisma is individual and immediate, a 
function of evaporated distance, the shock 
of proximity. This is not about glamour 
shots, or the Discovery Channel. When 
BeeZe enters a room, he 
can make it go silent. 
In October, I sat in 
on one of BeeZe’s leash 
training sessions, held in 
the Learning Center where 
he would be making most 
of his presentations. It 
was one of the most 
unassuming areas of the 
zoo: several sets of metal 
bleachers ringed around a 
wooden stage backed by drab wooden sets. 
Someone had discreetly tacked a list of 
entrances, exits, and cues to the back of one 
of the walls, a leftover from some previous 
performance.


This was a two-trainer operation: one had 
a hold on the cat, and the other had a hold 
on the bait, a stick-and-string toy ending 
in a dangling fluffy tail. The secret was 
harnessing BeeZe’s prey drive, an exercise 
in empathy, intuition, and split-second 
anticipation. Expertly and even wittily 
controlled, the tail twitched just inches 
beyond his reach; the trainers watched for 
the twitch of an ear or the ripple of shoulder 
blades. BeeZe’s body language hinted at 
what he would do next, so that when he was 
about to propel forward, the trainer with the 
leash gave him the verbal command, “Let’s 
“I love those guys. They 
scare the hell out of 
me, but I love them. It’s 
a fascination based on 
respect.”

go,” and when he was about to jump, she 
called, “Up.” BeeZe would associate his 
own actions with his Ultimately, training 
was not about bending his will to theirs; 
human guidance had to be congruent with 
his natural instincts. Throughout, the leash 
needed to remain at a perfect degree of 
tautness. 
The 
entire 
process 
was 
incredibly 
quiet: no calliope music, no crack of the 
whip, just the sound of New England wind 
in the leaves, and beyond, the dull roar of 
traffic.  But for even in front of an audience 
of one,  BeeZe was a spectacle. The thrill I 
felt watching him was primal and strangely 
voyeuristic.
My return to the Learning Circle in August 
2013 brings the sight of a sign advertising 
for “BeeZe’s Wild Adventure!” and a line of 
young families and local summer campers 
waiting to be admitted. As the audience 
settles into the bleachers, volunteers in pale 
blue T-shirts circulate, offering a bobcat 
skull and swatch of fur for them to touch. 
The performance, ultimately, is a modest 
affair. Jim Knox takes the microphone and 
explains the rules to the small crowd: at 
their distance from the stage there is little 
danger of touching, but they all need to be 
quiet so that BeeZe can concentrate.
BeeZe enters, along with Clark and 
another trainer, Chrissy Shore. Shore has his 
leash, and Clark a leafy bamboo switch and 
a handful of treats: shrimp and a zoo feed 
called Feline Diet. The switch is dangled in 
front of him like the squirrel’s tail was once, 
directing his attention to a model waterfall 
onstage, or the wooden railing that they 
want him to balance along, or the ledge on 
which they want him to leap. As the three 
of them move behind him, Knox explains 
bobcat behaviors, elaborating on their 
preferred habitats, diet, and times of day. 
When he tells the visitors about how BeeZe 
came to live at the Beardsley Zoo, he jokes 
that the bobcat gets free room and board, 
and free medical and dental plans. The 
entire presentation lasts only around ten 
minutes, and after BeeZe exits the stage, 
Knox takes questions and answers from the 
crowd. A couple of people comment that 
they have seen bobcats in their yards, which 
piques his interest. “Which town?” Knox 
asks. When they ask what they should do 
about these sightings, he answers that they 
should just keep at a safe distance.
BeeZe 
performs 
this 
educational 
program about three times a week, in 
addition 
his 
other 
ambassadorial 
visits. His schedule since this February 
has included ten birthday parties, and a 
corporate event for the Bridgewater Fund. 
When he hits the one-year mark, the staff 
will begin advertising encounters with him 
more widely. He’s even more relaxed, they 
say, in the zoo’s indoor spaces. Though 
his trainers had worried about what would 
happen when he went through puberty at 
nine months—some animals refuse further 
training and socialization and must be 
transitioned to exhibits—the process was 
much less difficult than they had anticipated.
“Sometimes he was moody with us, but 
he’s a professional,” Chrissy says. “When he 
needs to work, he works.”
BeeZe will continue to educate assemblies 
of students and campers, and to make 
appearances at birthday parties. He will 
walk along the rows of kids who have 
been given strict instructions not to touch. 
They’ll whisper and shriek, exclaiming over 
his immaculate fluffiness, his nubby tail. 
What they are too young to notice, the 
adult guests might: his perceptive gaze, his 
impenetrable silence. They will take photos 
for which he will not pose, not exactly. 
BeeZe’s attention will move in unreadable 
ways. He will sit utterly composed, perfectly 
safe but never quite harmless, collar unable 
to make us forget those teeth.
