“DO YOU SING?” 
Yale boasts over four hundred active un­
dergraduate organizations, but if you mea­
sure activity in terms of decibel levels, there 
is really only one to note. Every August, 
hordes of ardently chirpy a cappella singers 
descend upon timid freshmen continuously 
asking the dreaded question. Oh, you anx­
ious-to-please freshmen, making bad jokes 
like, “Only in the shower!” “Well, I’m not go­
ing to quit my day job!” After the hundredth 
ask, even questions such as, “Are you mad 
at me?” and, “Do you have a boyfriend?” 
would suddenly seem like fun, normal con­
versation starters to you. You begin to won­
der, “Should I sing?” before remembering 
that you cannot, and have never been able 
to. 

The onslaught doesn’t stop at the ex­
tracurricular bazaar. One night at the dining 
hall, the topic of conversation is “rushing.” 
Well, every night at the dining hall, the topic 
of conversation has been rushing, but it isn’t 
until this particular plate of Berkeley mac  
’n’ cheese that you realize: it’s never been 
about Greek life! It’s always been about a 
cappella! You feel bewildered and bereft as 
you try to keep up with the chatter about 
callbacks, rush meals, and singing desserts. 
None of this was in any of the movies. Is this 
college? Where are the togas?

A cappella rush season and its full cal­
endar of parties and performances has tra­
ditionally sprawled over the entire month 
of September. It ramps up for a pre-tap pe­
riod, when the thirteen singing groups un­
der the Singing Group Council (SGC) alert 
the hopefuls of their picks. When the pro­
cess finally culminates in “tap night,” each 
singing group selects its fastest runner to 
sprint through the Old Campus gates and 
up the stairs of the freshman dorms. The 
upperclassmen singers are drunk—either on 
vodka or on the festive spirit. Some groups 
wear matching T-shirts and yell nonsense. 
Other groups wear matching jersey pin­
nies and sing nonsense. Some freshmen cry 
of joy. Others cry from rejection. Together, 
the newly constituted and divinely chosen 
groups belt out that immortal anthem that 
closes out the musical version of Les Mis­
erables: “Do You Hear The People Sing?”

Yes. Yes we do.

But rush is not the lawless free-for-all 
that we tone-deaf outsiders may think it to 
be. It operates according to a highly ordered 
system of rules spelled out for the first time 
this year in a Rush Manifesto—a document 
sanctioned, circulated, and enforced by the 
aca gods, the almighty SGC. The council 
is always composed of two men and two 
women, including one member from each 
of the all-senior groups, the Whiffenpoofs 
and Whim ‘n Rhythm. 

“In recent Yale a cappella history, we 
as a community have gotten vicious dur­
ing rush,” the 2013 manifesto, sub-headed 
“How to Not be an Ass,” admits. The docu­
ment speaks to change that is radical and 
relevant for the entire campus: rush will be 
shortened by almost two weeks. The calen­
dar change avoids the overlap of Peter Sa­
lovey’s inauguration and Parents’ Weekend.

Over the course of seventeen pages, 
the manifesto outlines proper procedure for 
each stage of the rush process. Before the 
first big a cappella party at the off-campus 
house of the Sons of Orpheus and Bacchus, 
each group must deliver their tithe of al­
cohol to the house no later than forty-five 
minutes before the start of festivities. Dur­
ing the second, more intimate Dwight Hall 
Jam, space will be limited, the manifesto 
warns, leading us to rule number two, “Only 
necessary personnel should be present dur­
ing setup—Don’t crowd Dwight with people 
standing around doing nothing. You’re not 
fooling anyone.”

Further bylaws govern behavior out­
side of official events, including what the 
manifesto terms “outside contact.” It bans 
unsanctioned meals, secret meetings, and a 
litany of other activities: “No picnics,” “No 
sketch walks,” and, “No sitting with rushees 
in class.” Bolded type announces “the new 
T-shirts rule,” which has been relaxed this 
year in order to allow singers to wear their 
group’s T-shirt as soon as their feet land in 
New Haven in August. “It takes a special 
person to abuse the power of an a cappella 
shirt,” the manifesto reads. We think they’re 
all special. 

But what is crime without punishment? 
Extreme violations of the “Spirit of Rush” 
may call for the convening of not only the 
Singing Group Council, but also a subcom­
mittee, which needs to rule with a three-
quarters majority vote that a violation had 
occurred. These measures are supplement­
ed by online “badgering hotlines,” which 
allow rushees to email the SGC to anony­
mously report instances of harassment. 
Unfortunately the Council has yet to re­
lease the badgering hotline information for 
the rest of us, but we’ll let you know if we 
hear anything. After all, this is an a cappella 
world. We’re just living in it.
