from home. 
The layoff, she says, shoved her from 
the lower-middle class to the lower class. 
Eventually, her children needed scholarships 
from their high school to continue playing 
varsity sports. Her son couldn’t get his 
driver’s license because she couldn’t afford 
the lessons. The family received subsidized 
heating. They gave up cable TV, vacations, 
cell phones—and then, fresh meat, fruits, 
and vegetables. She started going to food 
banks. 

McKee estimates that she applied to 
over fifty jobs, some below her skill level 
and some in areas so unsafe that her friends 
prayed she wouldn’t get them. She was 
called for only two in-person interviews, 
and never got a job offer. McKee suspects 
that she was discriminated against because 
of her age and unemployment. She felt 
defeated.
“The way I thought about myself was 
that I couldn’t do anything right,” McKee 
says. “You’re out that long, there’s no way 
to keep up how you feel.”
Then McKee read an article about 
Platform to Employment and, willing to try 
anything, filled out an application. According 
to McKee, she was the last person to be 
accepted to the class that began in October 
2011. She never missed a single training 
session. 

One goal of P2E training is to teach 
participants to think of themselves as 
brands, in order to better promote their 
unique set of skills and abilities. To that 
end, they  complete activities such as the 
“Fruit Tree Exercise.” Presented with a 
blank picture of a fruit tree, they write their 
skills on the fruits and their values on the 
leaves. Such exercises may seem childish, 
but they are an intentionally simple part of 
the program’s structured environment for 
productive self-examination. 

The curriculum, McKee says, taught her 
that to get a job, “You had to shine brighter. 
You had to have six points on your star 
rather than five.”
Right after completing the first part of the 
program, McKee went on four interviews for 
the Bridgeport Regional Business Council. 
They hired her before the eight-week work 
period even started. She worked as director 
of finance part-time for ten months and was

people who were looking 
for a challenge. We don’t 
want people who are 
proving that there’s no 
way of saving them.”
hired full-time in September 2012. 
“I went from feeling like a minus 10 to, 
like, an 80,” she said. “My old personality 
has come out, and it’s sharper because I’m 
working again.”
McKee has a renewed sense of personal 
satisfaction, but says her work pays barely 
enough to survive. She still lives in housing 
with no cable and no long-distance phone. 
Her son left for the Marines in August, so 
the child-support payments she had been 
relying on stopped coming. To compensate, 
she is trying to get a mortgage modification. 
She expects that she will never be able to 
retire. 

That’s not unusual for workers who lost 
their jobs during the recession. Many jobs 
regained during the recovery have been low 
wage. A 2012 study by the 
National Employment Law 
Project found that lower-
wage occupations made 
up 21 percent of recession 
losses, but 58 percent of 
recent employment gains, 
creating an unbalanced 
recovery that researchers 
warn 
will 
cement 
America’s long-term rise 
in inequality. Even once 
they 
are 
re-employed, 
McKee and millions like her continue to 
struggle.
Worse yet, some P2E graduates do 
not find job placements at all. At seventy 
years old, Catherine Sidor has a lifetime of 
experience bringing tourists to Connecticut 
and 
New 
York. 
The 
Fairfield 
County 
Convention and Visitors’ Bureau, where she 
was executive director, was shut down in 
2009, and she attended P2E thinking she 
would easily secure a job shortly thereafter. 
But even though she worked with a P2E job 
counselor for several months, she remains 
unemployed.
Sidor does not blame Platform to 
Employment for not getting her a job. They 
referred her to a position in New Haven 
for which she had two interviews, but 
didn’t get the job. Offered an interview for 
another position in Newtown, she turned it 
down to the prohibitively long commute. 
According to Sidor, the real issue was that 
Connecticut’s economy was just too bleak. 
“I’m not blaming them for not having 
enough employer commitments,” she said. 
“Connecticut doesn’t have any openings. 
They were being idealistic.”
Yet Sidor she holds that training was 
valuable. P2E’s insistence upon personal 
reflection helps its cohorts to become very 
close, very fast. Seeing that their classmates 
face the same struggles, participants feel 
less alone.
“People seemed to benefit from the 
community and the connection because they 
had been so isolated,” says Nancy Legow, a 
behavioral health consultant who counseled 
P2E participants during 
and after their training. “It 
was good [for them] to be 
part of a group, to have 
somewhere to go, to not 
feel so alone.”
Sidor 
valued 
that 
camaraderie. She has kept 
in contact with McKee 
since the end of the class 
almost two years ago.

In February 2012, P2E was featured on 
CBS’s 60 Minutes. After the piece aired, the 
WorkPlace was flooded with requests from 
other organizations coordinating workplace 
development to start programs around the 
country, and now P2E is expanding to ten 
cities. The programs in Cincinnati and Dallas 
have seen job placement rates as high 
as seventy-one and eighty-one percent, 
respectively.

a 
national 
research experiment funded by Wal-Mart, 
AARP, and Citi Community Development, 
part of CitiGroup, to show that P2E can be 
successfully replicated around the country.

possible, The WorkPlace is selecting the 
participants for each city’s program.

program reach even farther. He wants 
Platform to Employment to become the 
centerpiece of a national discussion about 
why the long-term unemployed remain 
unemployed. In the last six months, Carbone 
says he has been to the White House, 
testified before congressional committees, 
and spoken to Democratic Senators, the 
National 
Governors’ 
Association, 
the 
Clinton Global Initiative and local chambers 
of commerce about the plight of the long-
term unemployed.
He says that people are finally beginning 
to listen. “No one thought it was important 
enough to even think about them before,” he 
said. “It’s beginning now to surface. Really, 
the nation is beginning to pay attention to 
this.”
During the 2013 legislative session, 
nine states have introduced bills that 
would prohibit discrimination against the 
unemployed. New Jersey, Oregon, and the 
District of Columbia already have similar laws 
on the books. Connecticut Congresswoman 
Rosa DeLauro sponsored legislation last year 
that would have prohibited such practices 
nationwide, but House Republicans decided 
not to bring the bill up for a vote.
If there is any respect in which P2E is 
a real, replicable solution to long-term 
unemployment, it is its ability to empower 
its graduates to change the unemployment 
landscape themselves. Each graduate who 
gets a job and performs that job well changes 
the opinion of one more employer about the 
skills of the long-term unemployed.
Employers’ responses have been fairly 
positive. A survey conducted by the Harvard 
Business 
School 
Club 
of 
Connecticut 
Community Partners surveyed employers 
after they had worked with P2E graduates 
for two months. On average, the employers 
cited most that they liked the employee’s 
“positive outlook,” “realistic expectations,” 
and “eagerness to work.” Eighty-eight 
percent of the respondents said they would 
consider hiring another P2E participant in 
the future.
Bob Greeney has turned in his Santa suit 
for a Metro North uniform. He sells tickets at 
the Stamford Metro-North Railroad Station 
from 6 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. five days a week, full-
time. He has been with the MTA since May 
2012. He enjoys the ten-minute commute to 
work from his Stamford apartment—until 
this past June, he had working much further 
away, at Grand Central Station.
On his one-year anniversary of regaining 
employment, Greeney got a small raise 
and benefits for dental and eye care. He 
now makes $21.33 an hour. Annually, that’s 
a significant pay cut from the $49,000, 
including overtime and holiday pay he 
made during his last year as a sports writer 
at The Stamford Advocate. During what he 
calls the extra “life hours,” whch he saves 
with his shorter commute, Greeney picks up 
odd jobs, like delivering flowers, just as he 
used to.
But even a year later, Greeney is so 
relieved that he’s made it off what he calls 
“Unemployment Island,” that he says he 
can’t complain. 
“I was drifting out at sea, holding onto 
a little plank, keeping my head above the 
water.” he said, “And then the good ship P2E 
came along. Joe Carbone was at the bow of 
the ship with the life preserver. ‘We got you, 
Bob. We’re going to throw this to you.’ I was 
professionally adrift and P2E was there to 
come and save me.”
Many long-term unemployed can’t say 
the same, beaten back by politicians who 
have overlooked them and businesses that 
continually send them to the back of the 
line. P2E has reached out, but it will take a 
lot more to turn the tide.
