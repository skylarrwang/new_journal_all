Greeney 
steeled 
himself 
and 
stepped into the big red suit for a kids’ 
Christmas party in December 2010. 
Greeney, a 55-year-old Stamford native, 
had been unemployed for a year and a half 
and was doing anything he could to get by: 
delivering flowers, holding up yardsticks 
at high school football games, and dealing 
cards at casino parties.

Before his unemployment, Greeney says, 
he could never have imagined such depths of 
desperation. For twenty-nine years, he had 
worked as a sports writer, with newspapers 
across the Midwest and East Coast carrying 
his stories. It had been his dream career 
ever since his college days, 
when he had broadcast 
Indiana State University’s 
basketball 
games 
over 
the campus radio. When, 
in 2009, the Stamford 
Advocate cut Greeney and 
two other sports writers 
from its staff, he saw a 
chance to reinvent himself. 
Thinking that his years 
of journalism experience 
offered transferrable skills—“I had a great 
work ethic and reputation, I could deal with 
deadlines, and I could write”—he applied 
to job openings in corporate writing and 
copy editing. Though he was once one of 
two final candidates for a United Healthcare 
writing position, he had little success.

Six months after the Santa gig, Greeney 
became a 99er. Unable to find a full-time 
job, he had used up the ninety-nine weeks 
of unemployment benefits then offered to 
him by the state of Connecticut.

Greeney is not alone. Although federal 
and state legislatures have extended the 
length of unemployment benefits multiple 
times, many find themselves in the same 
position—unable to secure work before the 
money runs out, even as the economy shows 
strong signs of recovery. At least five million 
people in the United States have been out of 
work for over six months and are therefore 
considered long-term unemployed.

Yet their voices often go unheard in 
the ongoing national conversation about 
employment. While government officials 
and talking heads pick over the monthly 
reports detailing the numbers of jobs added 
to the economy, far less attention is paid 
to an ongoing crisis which has potentially 
more dire consequences: the dramatic rise 
of long-term unemployment. According to 
the Department of Labor, the percentage of 
unemployed who had been out of work for 
fifty-two weeks or longer jumped from 5.8 
percent to 29.2 percent in the last decade. 
Re-define “long-term” as being out of work 
for twenty-seven weeks or 
longer, and that number 
rises to 41.4 percent in 
2012, according to the 
National Employment Law 
Project. But regardless of 
how they are counted, it 
is becoming conceivable, 
even likely, that the long-
term 
unemployed 
will 
become the permanently 
unemployed.

Two years after being laid off, Greeney 
learned about Platform to Employment 
(P2E), a new jobs initiative based in 
Bridgeport. P2E offers five weeks of 
career coaching, social media training, and 
confidence-building workshops, followed 
by an eight-week paid work experience, 
which, ideally, leads to a full-time position. 
He enrolled in P2E in August 2011 as a 
member of its first graduating class.

Some local resources had previously 
existed 
for 
those 
seeking 
work. 
The 
WorkPlace, the nonprofit that designed 
and administered P2E, operates a system 
of career centers throughout southwestern 
Connecticut. Providing job listings, training 
referrals, 
career 
counseling, 
the 
“If you’re gonna be Santa, Bob, be 
the best damn Santa you can be.”
At least five million 
people in the United 
States have been out of 
work for over six months.
Opposite: Bob Greeney had worked as a sports writer for twenty-nine years before he
became one of the long-term unemployed.

the new journal
WorkPlace seeks to be a resource for 
populations 
who 
have 
an 
especially 
challenging 
time 
finding 
employment, 
including veterans, the prison re-entry 
population, 
dislocated 
workers, 
disabled 
workers. 
President 
CEO 
Joseph Carbone founded P2E to address 
the distinct and urgent needs of the long-
term unemployed.

In 2010, the U.S. Department of Labor 
estimated people unemployed for twenty-
seven weeks or more only had a 10 
percent chance of finding stable work in a 
subsequent month. Against these odds, P2E 
presents a remarkable success rate: since 
its founding in May 2011, 69 percent of its 
graduates have secured full-time work. To 
improve its participants’ prospects, P2E 
tackles the emotional turbulence of long-
term unemployment, then works to make its 
participants more attractive to employers. 
More importantly, the program works to 
make the long-term unemployed visible 
again.

Though Greeney’s story mirrors the 
plight of millions of other Americans, he and 
his fellow members of the pilot program were 
chosen carefully. To find its first one hundred 
participants, 
WorkPlace 
contacted 
the last 1,400 people who, according to 
the Connecticut Department of Labor, 
had run out of unemployment benefits. 
The selection process included an online 
application and an interview, ultimately 
netting a diverse sample of Connecticut’s 
long-term unemployed: former investment 
bankers and factory workers, people with 
master’s degrees and people with only high 
school diplomas. But while The WorkPlace 
wanted to avoid cherry-picking candidates, 
they still selected for evidence of active 
job searching and readiness to re-enter the 
workforce.

Carbone sums up the criteria like this: 
“We were looking for people who were 
looking for a challenge. We don’t want 
people who are proving that there’s no way 
of saving them.”

Many are in desperate need of a 
lifeline—and through no fault of their own, 
economists say. Even as the stock market 
has risen and overall unemployment has 
fallen in recent years, one section of the 
labor market has struggled even to get their 
resumes seen: the long-term unemployed. 
A recent study showed that more-qualified 
applicants who had been out of work for at

least six months got fewer callbacks from 
employers than less qualified applicants 
who had been out of work for less time. 
Some employers explicitly exclude job 
applicants based on the duration of their 
unemployment, a practice that is both 
widespread and legal. What results is a 
vicious cycle in which the people most 
desperate for a job are effectively barred 
from the workforce. Economists warn 
that the long-term unemployed may soon 
become unemployable.

P2E seeks to intervene in this cycle in two 
ways. The first phase, designed to address 
the debilitating frustration that many of the 
long-term unemployed experience, consists 
of approximately one hundred hours of 
training sessions that Carbone hopes will 
build participants’ self-confidence. Seventy 
percent of the class sessions are devoted 
to the “psychology of careering,” a process 
of guided self-reflection to better the job 
search . The rest covers the basics of getting 
a job: interviewing, resume and cover letter 
writing, social media, dressing for work, 
and telephone etiquette. The psychology 
of careering revs people up to fully take 
advantage 
of 
networking 
skills 
that are, in some ways, the most central 
component of the class.

The second phase of the program is 
called a “paid work experience,” and pairs a 
graduate with a business for an eight-week 
trial period. This time provides participants 
with an opportunity to prove to themselves 
and to employers that they can work again. 
P2E pays the first four weeks’ wages to 
make the arrangement more appealing to 
employers. Eighty-seven percent of P2E 
graduates are hired by their employer at the 
end of eight weeks.

Part of the training program directly 
coaches participants to reclaim control of 
their lives. After months of job-searching 
at home, they get back on a schedule: they 
wake up in the morning, dress in professional 
attire, and come to class for six hours a day, 
four days a week.

Carbone’s 
own 
experience 
with 
unemployment 
inspired 
program’s 
philosophy. For eight and a half months 
in 1990, Carbone struggled to find work, 
spending his afternoons watching soap 
operas. He drove to grocery stores twenty 
miles away to avoid seeing people he 
knew and having to explain why he wasn’t 
working.

Six months into his unemployment, he 
was up for a second job interview. On his 
way to the interview, his wife called him with 
a message he had missed: the interview was 
cancelled because the job had been filled. 
Carbone barely cared. He said he looked 
at his watch and thought to himself that, 
if he hurried home, he could make General 
Hospital at 3 p.m. 

In retrospect, Carbone is horrified by 
the complacency he once felt about his own 
joblessness, but he says that he would not 
understand the emotional strain of long-term 
unemployment if he hadn’t experienced it 
himself. These days, Carbone is the picture 
of career success, in his suits with collared 
shirts buttoned up to the neck. But when 
he starts talking about the fate of the long-
term unemployed, his composure cracks. 
His voice trembles, his forehead wrinkles, 
and the skin around his eyes reddens. What 
upsets Carbone most is that the 99ers 
come to believe something is wrong with 
them, when even economists struggle to 
describe why employers have marked them 
unworthy of a second chance. Carbone 
barely contains his tears, his language 
taking a suddenly aggressive turn as he 
compares the situation to untreated cancer, 
the disease worsening and spreading.

“We are complicit in sacrificing [the long-
term unemployed] in the transition from the 
pre- to the post-recession economy,” he 
says. 

Helen McKee feared she was headed 
down that path. In October 2009, she 
was laid off by the Bridgeport distributor 
of jewelry and dental supplies where she 
had worked as an accountant for thirteen 
years. A single mother of two teenagers, 
she survived on unemployment benefits 
and the little cash she made doing work 
for friends—babysitting, cleaning houses, 
washing windows, and making sales calls
