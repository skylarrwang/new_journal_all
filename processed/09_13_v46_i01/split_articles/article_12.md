“I’ve known you four years, and don’t 
know who you are,” he says. 
By midnight we are holding hands. Bill 
breaks the circle, pulling us into a spiral 
which unspools and leads downstairs, where 
we weave through cluttered rooms full of 
people and music, then to the basement, 
wandering past the ping-pong table and 
the punching bag, then back up to the barn. 
The song stops, we clap for the band, and 
finally, it is time for the last dance: the group 
waltz. The recorder slows; the notes stretch. 
It is the waltz where, a year ago, I began a 
romance that led to months of letters and 
poems. It is the waltz where I have been 
clutched by a nervous man who asked to 
dance without making eye contact, and 
then once we were dancing, counted, “1, 2, 
3; 1, 2, 3” under his breath, his concentration 
too fierce for interruption. It is the waltz 
where I have laughed holding a roommate, 
spinning each other around, dancing only 
on our toes. But tonight, I sway, instead. I 
join into a circle with Bill, and he counts, “1, 
2, 3; 1, 2, 3” into his microphone. Our sweaty 
arms touch and wrap around each other, 
and we move our feet to the beat, counting 
“1, 2, 3; 1, 2, 3; 1, 2, 3.”
