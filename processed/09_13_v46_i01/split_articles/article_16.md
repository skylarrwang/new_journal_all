Saving Grace
T
his is Lexington, a small town only an 
hour outside of Atlanta. But in this land 
of boiled peanuts and dairy farms, I feel 
worlds away. I’m in the Georgian countryside, 
at the home of Burl Salmon, my formƒer 
high school English teacher and a graduate 
of Yale Divinity School. His neighbor is the 
photographer for the magazine Gun and 
Garden, the self-proclaimed “Soul of the 
South.” I’ve been here a few times to visit 
Burl on trips back from college, and the area 
has always felt familiar. Though I grew up 
in Atlanta, my family comes largely from 
rural Virginia in the Blue Ridge Mountains. 
There, as here, the pace is slow. It’s a 
sweltering summer afternoon and thunder-
rolls reverberate through the surrounding 
pastureland, promising a storm. Still, Burl 
and I sit together outside on his porch, 
that sacred Southern meeting place for 
socializing and storytelling. 
“Would you like a glass of lemonade? 
Sweet tea?” he offers. A slight Southern 
twang accents his speech. 

The first time I met Burl, I was a 
teenager at a small, nondenominational 
Christian private school in Atlanta. Though 
my classmates would have denied being 
bigoted, gay people just didn’t fit into our 
conservative, privileged bubble, and we 
had never had a teacher as open about his 
sexuality as Burl.

He charmed my high school English 
class—and soon the entire school—into 
not only accepting, but also embracing his 
identity. For years, I have wondered how 
Burl managed to prove likeable even to the 
boys who called him a “fag” behind his back.

After I graduated, the school honored 
Burl with its most prestigious teaching award. 
Earlier that year, he had led the homecoming 
day parade in silver stilettos and a blond wig 
in the style of Aretha Franklin.

This fall, Burl will leave my old high 
school for a position as chaplain at an 
Episcopalian middle school in Charlotte, 
North Carolina. After making it through an 
unusually convoluted, decades-long process 
to become an Episcopalian priest, he is 
eager to start his first job in the ministry. He 
will commute to Charlotte during the week; 
on the weekends, he will continue to live 
with his husband Bob in their white-washed 
old farmhouse in Lexington. The house has 
fallen into disrepair, but they are giving the 
dining room a fresh coat of paint in a color 
I doubt it has seen before: “I call it coral, 
kissed by shrimp.”

“This is home now,” Burl explains. 
Here, in this old house, in a town where his 
ancestors once lived, he is finally putting 
down roots with his partner of ten years—
and his cat, Caspar. “Never forget the cat,” 
he instructs me.

This place reminds Burl of the farm 
where 
he 
grew 
up 
outside 
Natchez, 
Mississippi—a town whose motto is, “Where 
the Old South still lives.” Imagine mansions 
straight out of Gone with the Wind lined 
up along the mighty Mississippi. These 
antebellum homes are still owned in large 
part by families who struck rich on “white 
gold,” when the town was a major cotton 
exporter in the nineteenth century. To this 
day, local families participate in the Natchez 
Pilgrimage, a celebration of Southern 
opulence involving hoop skirts, long white 
gloves, and scenes of Confederate life. 
Burl was an actor in these annual tableaus 
from kindergarten through his junior year in 
college. 

“It must have been hard to grow up 
there, right?” I ask.

“Natchez is an odd little brigadoon,” 
Burl explains. “It is the most liberal corner 
of a highly conservative state. There’s 
this acceptance of the bizarre, which is 
so antithetical to what we understand as 
the South now, where everyone must be a 
Baptist and religiously conservative.”


There’s an old joke that most people 
hide their crazy relatives up in the attic 
while Southerners put them on the front 
porch. This is especially true in Natchez. 
For Burl, it was never unusual to see C.T. 
Kelly, a well-dressed, mentally handicapped 
man, wave to passersby while standing 
alongside a black servant paid for by his 
trust fund. Everyone waved back. It was 
equally unremarkable when a mother had a 
staircase installed down to the casket in her 
child’s grave in the Natchez City Cemetery 
because the girl was afraid of thunder, and 
her mother wanted to be able to sit with her 
during a storm.


In a town where oddity was the norm, 
Burl found it relatively easy to grow up as an 
openly gay boy—at least compared to the 
rest of Mississippi. The prevailing spirit of 
Natchez was aristocratic and laissez-faire, 
the kind of liberalism and sophistication 
afforded by longstanding wealth. Though 
sex and sexual orientation were never 
openly discussed in the community, Burl 
was just another eccentric local character. 


“There were more than a few well-
dressed antique dealers in town,” Burl says 
with a laugh. “I never knew what it was not 
to be out.”

This didn’t mean that he never got 
teased at school. He comments dryly, “It is 
unfortunate that the name Burl rhymes with 
girl.”

Growing up in Atlanta with technically 
Episcopalian, but essentially non-religious 
parents, I did not witness such acceptance. 
A classmate once told me she felt it was 
crucial that gay people never be allowed to 
marry. The Bible is against it, she said, “and 
if we don’t draw the line somewhere—then 
where will we draw it?” I wasn’t sure what to 
say. I didn’t know the Bible well enough then 
to counter that Jesus never condemned 
homosexuality, the way that Burl could have. 
I told her it seemed a little closed-minded. 

For the most part, Burl, who grew up 
Methodist, did find acceptance, especially 
at church. There, he did not encounter the 
prejudice he did at school—even the anti-gay 
Methodists at state conferences practiced 
Southern politeness in all regards. “I never, 
ever heard anyone say homosexuality was 
sinful,” he says. “The message of Southern 
Methodism was that God is love. That’s how 
I was raised. And as a gay boy in Mississippi, 
that is a wonderful message.” 

Everyone in Burl’s household ƒiattended 
church on Sunday, every Sunday. If you had 
time to stay out late the Saturday before, 
Burl’s mother would admonish, you have 
time to go to church in the morning. I would 
expect such a stern mandate to push a 
child away from religion, but Burl has been 
intensely spiritual his entire life. In college, 
he converted to Episcopalianism, the faith 
in which his father was raised. From an early 
age, church was his refuge, and he knew that 
he would devote his life to religious service.

“I believed I had a call,” Burl says. But 
he could not simply decide to become a 
priest; he also faced the task of proving to a 
slew of church leaders that God had chosen 
him. At any point in the long path towards 
priesthood, any Episcopalian official could 
stop the process, for any reason.

“It’s probably a medieval construct,” 
Burl admits. “It has become a place for the 
exercise of power for persons that might 
not feel they have power in other places.”

In 1995, he took the first step toward 
ordination by applying to seminary, and 
needed the official endorsement of his 
bishop, the elected head of the Episcopalian 
church in Mississippi. In New Jersey that 
same year, a bishop had ordained an openly 
gay man and been put on trial for heresy by 
the Episcopalian Church. If he was acquitted, 
it could be very good news for Burl, the 
Mississippi bishop said. But until then, he 
was simply unwilling to give Burl his support. 
Natchez may have been unusually liberal, 
but the state was still highly conservative. 
So Burl enrolled at Yale Divinity School 
(YDS), the only seminary in the United States 
that did not require the official support of a 
bishop for matriculation. He hoped to return 
to Mississippi and complete the ordination 
process after the trial concluded. 

At YDS, Burl found that the combination 
of his sexuality and his Southern background 
made him an object of fascination. 

“They were like ‘Whoa—you’re gay? 
And you’re from Mississippi? And you’re 
Christian? How did you survive?’” Burl says. 
“I actually had people ask me if I’d received 
electroshock treatment.”

His classmates eventually got to know 
him better and, like at my high school,
