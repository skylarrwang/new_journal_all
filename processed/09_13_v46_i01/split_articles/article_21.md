O
ver lunch early in my freshman year, 
my friend Madeleine Witt told me 
she had been at a Yale Students for 
Christ retreat that weekend. I asked her how 
it had gone.
She smiled.
“I had the most intense religious 
experience of my life,” she said. “It 
completely changed my relationship with 
Jesus.”

For the rest of the day, I puzzled over 
those words. I’d thought religion was 
something people only found, or sought 
to deepen, in times of need. Witt was a 
talented artist at a prestigious school, with a 
warm, earthy demeanor and a strong sense 
of humor. She seemed to have her life in 
order. What could Jesus do for Witt that she 
couldn’t do for herself? 

If God has been watching me this whole 
time, I hope He understands that before I 
got to college, I couldn’t help but be cynical 
about the usefulness of any particular faith.
My mother is Unitarian and my father 
Jewish (with an interest in Buddhism). 
I 
grew 
up 
with 
evangelical 
Christian 
neighbors. Their son—my best friend at the 
time—once saved me in the name of Christ 
in their basement. We were eight, and we 
had gotten bored with our plastic lightsaber 
duel. After that, I was heaven-bound for 
sure, so I stopped worrying about the hell 
I’d seen in “Tom and Jerry” cartoons, which 
had been the source of a few nightmares. 

My parents sold me on Hebrew school 
by describing it as a set of language classes 
with a party at the end. At nine years old, I 
saw my religious education as just another 
chore. The Torah portion that I read years 
later at my bar mitzvah featured my 
namesake, Aaron, brother of Moses. His 
sons, Nadab and Abihu, get drunk and offer 
the wrong incense to God, who incinerates 
them in response. Aaron doesn’t mourn; to 
do so would be to question God’s judgment. 

During the same few months I spent 
memorizing this passage in the original 
Hebrew, I came across a copy of Richard 
Dawkins’ The God Delusion, which served 
as my first serious exposure to a variety 
of useful concepts: cosmology beyond 
the book of Genesis, morality beyond the 
Ten Commandments, evolution beyond 
Pokémon. Dawkins can be strident at times, 
but I preferred him to God. I’ve been a 
nonbeliever ever since.

But by my second week on campus at 
Yale, religion became unavoidable. My new 
friends included a Catholic who kept her 
favorite Bible quotes on Post-It notes over 
her desk, a vegetarian Hindu who believed 
in karma, and an atheist whose hobby was 
sampling churches and listening without 
retort to believers. On hammocks and 
benches, during long walks and over long 
dinners, I struggled to comprehend the way 
they saw the world.

Witt’s religious awakening—like that of 
many of the converts I talked to—was outside 
my realm of understanding. I wondered 
if it was really a coincidence that her new 
relationship with Jesus began at a retreat 
where she’d begun new relationships with 
a few dozen Christian friends. Why would 
God wait to find her on a dock in the woods 
when she’d been going to church her entire 
life? Though I saw campus conversion as an 
uncommon tangent to college life, I needed 
to figure out how and why it happened—
how Yale, which had intensified my atheism 
by exposing me to neuroscience and secular 
philosophy, had had the opposite effect on 
one of my closest friends.

For many, college is the first time we 
leave home. Religion, and the friends who 
come with it, can be comfortable and solid 
when life seems formless or uncertain. The 
students I met often spoke of a chaotic 
transition to Yale, and of finding peace in 
religious study, or the church choir, or moral 
philosophy with grounding holier than those 
of Aristotle or John Stuart Mill. I wondered 
if Witt, who sings in the Christian a cappella 
group Living Water, might have found similar 
comfort in joining a nonreligious group like 
The New Blue or Something Extra. 

So I started looking for students who 
had undergone religious conversions while 
at Yale. Their stories were diverse, and three 
stood out in particular. An undergrad named 
Kim Fabian was fond of Christianity but 
saw no reason to join the religion, until an 
emotional crisis helped her find Jesus. Bijan 
Aboutorabi went from atheist to Catholic, 
one classic work of theology at a time. And 
Witt, it turns out, walked a long and winding 
road before her evening on the dock. 

At Witt’s twentieth birthday party, I 
asked her whether she could introduce me 
to any friends who had become more deeply 
connected to Christianity while at Yale. She 
pointed to three of the people sitting on her 
couch, including Kim Fabian. While Fabian 
identifies as Christian now, she has doubts 
to overcome. 
“I describe myself as a baby Christian,” 
she explains over dinner. “I’m still figuring a 
lot of stuff out.” 

Her modest self-description marks a 
major shift from the behavior that got she 
kicked out of Sunday school at the age of 
seven. 
“What’s the word for purposefully being 
antagonistic and arguing with people?” 
Fabian asks.
“Contrary?”
“Yeah! And I was a disruption.”

The church asked her parents to 
“reform” her and send her back, but they 
decided that she was fine the way she was. 
After a few churchless years, she began 
attending Unitarian Universalist services, 
which appealed to her spiritual side but left 
her somehow unsatisfied. 
“There was this mentality in the church 
about tolerance, that all religions were 
to be accepted—except for Christianity.” 
Devout Muslims and Jews were welcome; 
while devout Christians weren’t exactly 
unwelcome, 
Fabian 
sensed 
antipathy 
toward the religion from her fellow Unitarian 
Universalists, and from herself. 

Ever the contrarian, she entered a Bible 
study group at her high school, hoping to 
understand and finally dispel her own past 
view of Christianity. At first, the task seemed 
difficult. She met some Christians who used 
religion as a weapon, to chastise or exclude 
the less devout. From what Fabian knew of 
Jesus, this felt like hypocrisy.  

But others in the group managed to 
combine serious religion with kind behavior, 
and soon became some of her best 
friends. As she spent more time with them, 
and began to read more humorous and 
humanizing account of Jesus’ life in a book 
called The Gospel According to Biff, her 
remaining antipathy disappeared. Still, after 
her time with the Unitarian Universalists, 
she felt that all religions held some truth—
why choose between them?

It wasn’t until college that Fabian
