the new journal
returned to Christianity. After a series 
of incidents, in which she says she was 
responsible 
for 
“mean, 
hurtful 
things 
happening to close friends,” she looked for a 
higher pardon. Her friends’ forgiveness was 
not enough to erase what she had done. 
 “I needed salvation. I needed a savior.” 
Fabian has been a Christian ever since. 
Her newfound inner peace is apparent as 
I talk with her in the Buddhist meditation 
room at the base of Harkness Tower. 
She spends a lot of time here. It’s full of 
expensive-looking statues, and part of her 
paid student job is to make sure nobody 
steals them. She lights candles on the altar, 
waves a stick of incense in a complicated 
pattern, sets it down, and bows to a stone 
Buddha. Her hands are clasped; her face, 
expressionless. A few silent moments pass. 
“What was running through your head, 
during that ritual?” I ask later.
“Devotion, I guess.”
“Devotion towards what? God?”
“I hope so! Otherwise, I’m in trouble.” 
She laughs. 
Fabian plans to raise her future kids as 
Christians: “I just want them to know that 
no other person, or thing, is ever going to 
be enough.” 
Bijan Aboutorabi has many questions 
for me. “The greatest overall utility for 
humanity? How do you measure that? 
Where does it come from?”
The basis of my own morality is under 
fire. I can answer this, I think to myself. 
I don’t need a Bible, just a third of Mill’s 
Utilitarianism and a dash of David Hume. I 
should really get started on Reasons and 
Persons, too. 
Aboutorabi is good at engaging with 
uncomfortable questions. What is ethical? 
How do we know? How do we know 
anything, for that matter? Upon his junior-
year conversion to Catholicism, he found 
himself in possession of a complete, rigorous 
set of answers. He is the only convert I met 
who I believe might have chosen the same 
religion had he spent his life in a library, 
without the persuasive influence of a single 
human believer. Aboutorabi’s conversion 
was the work of divine logic.
Though he identified as a “militant 
atheist” in high school, at Yale Aboutorabi 
found himself spending more time with 
Catholic classmates, exploring the roots of 
his own morality. In college, he came face-
to-face with “serious philosophy,” which 
caused quite a few problems: 
“Nothing in materialism seemed to 
explain the existence of qualia,” he says, 
sounding distressed.
In philosophy, “qualia” are instances of 
conscious experience: the taste of cake above 
and beyond the understanding of pastry 
molecules, or the understanding of music as 
more than a collection of sonic frequencies.

Aboutorabi’s concern is common among 
scholars: if we’re just soulless collections 
of atoms, why does conscious experience 
exist? This is an important question, but he 
found no philosophical consensus as to the 
correct response.
Catholic 
philosophy 
offered 
an 
appealing set of answers; religious thinkers 
were bolder in their assertions than most 
modern secular ones. Aboutorabi says he 
read a great deal of C.S. Lewis and G.K. 
Chesterton but still “wasn’t able to flip the 
switch” toward faith. 
On the last day of sophomore year, he 
asked a Catholic friend and convert how 
he’d entered the fold: “He told me he’d felt 
a sudden sense of total, all-encompassing 
love.” 
Though he had then, and has now, 
almost no mystical life, Aboutorabi asked 
another friend what else might dissolve his 
uncertainty. When a response came back, he 
read and reread it until one day he realized 
he was “standing with one foot on either 
side of a ravine, which was growing wider, 
and I had to jump to one side or the other.” 
The choice, he says, was ultimately easy.



And so, without any singular mystical 
experience—no lightning strike or burning 
bush—Aboutorabi became a believer. On 
Easter of last year, he received his first Holy 
Communion and was baptized.
His story leaves me wondering, “So, 
atheism couldn’t answer your questions. 
Aren’t 
there 
questions 
Catholicism 
can’t 
answer?”
“A 
limit 
on 
human 
intellect is very different from 
something 
fundamentally 
unanswerable,” 
Aboutorabi 
replies. He knows there are 
parts of the metaphysical 
world 
he’ll 
never 
fully 
comprehend—the 
Trinity, 
the exact nature of hell—but 
he trusts that the Catholic 
Church has reached the right 
conclusions on all important spiritual matters. 
After all, they’ve been discussing those questions 
for the past two millennia. 



His 
understanding 
of 
Christian 
philosophy makes my moral foundations 
begin to feel like bamboo poles to his 
concrete pillars: flexible enough to tolerate 
some stress, but not much to look at, and 
skinny enough that they might buckle under 
the weight of a difficult choice. As we part, 
he calls my attention to “the unshakeable 
conviction of the Apostles that they had seen 
Jesus rise from the dead.” He is convinced 
he’s seen the same light as those earliest of 
Christian converts—and the experience has 
left him, as far as I can tell, unshakeable.
I knew before our interview that Witt 
had been religious before Yale, but I was 
looking for specifics about the conversion. 
“So, on a scale of one to ten, you went 
from, like… a four to a nine?”
“You can’t measure it on a scale like 
that!” she protests. We’re not speaking the 
same language, but if I listen hard enough, 
I might begin to understand what she calls 
“the most precious story in my life.” 



The first church Witt attended was tiny 
and rural, but her family moved while she was 
in middle school, and the new congregation 
had a few more kids her age. She considered 
herself faithful, but describes that faith as 
misdirected.
“I wore a WWJD bracelet, because 
that was what I thought Christians were 
supposed to do. But I didn’t understand 
what it meant,” Witt says. “What would 
Jesus do in this situation? 
He’d do a miracle! How 
does that help me?” 
In high school, Witt 
saw 
God 
as 
another 
authority figure she had 
to please, alongside her 
parents 
and 
teachers. 
With enough good deeds 
and pure thoughts, she’d 
earn God’s love and be 
a “good Christian.” She 
goes on to explain how 
wrong 
she 
was, 
that 
Christianity is unique, in that while “God 
asks everything of you,” God also knows 
that we are incapable of becoming worthy 
of his company through human effort alone. 



I ask Witt what led her to see things 
in this new light. Soon after she entered 
Yale, Witt explains, she met students unlike 
anyone she had encountered at home. 
“They were so committed to following 
Christ that they talked about Jesus like 
he was someone they knew,” she says, 
“Someone they could have an intimate 
relationship with. And this was something I 
was very curious about.”
At that first retreat, Witt heard a speaker 
discuss grace: the idea that Christ’s sacrifice 
was a gift from God to all those who would 
accept it and that “earning one’s way” to 
salvation wasn’t necessary, or even possible. 
The words resonated, perfectly contrasting 
old beliefs. 
“At the end of his talk, he said, ‘if you 
would like to accept this relationship with 
Christ, stand up!’ And I stood up.” She wasn’t 
the only one.
But it turns out I was wrong in thinking 
Witt found God in the woods: “He was 
equally with me in my childhood church. It’s 
just that my heart was changed, my eyes 
were opened.” Now, she thinks she could 
return to that church—or anywhere else in 
the world—and be as close to God as she 
was while on the dock. Yale was the place 
where she managed to fill what she calls 
the “God-shaped hole” in her heart, but she 
doesn’t expect that it will ever be empty 
again. 



I tell her that my heart feels, and has 
always felt, whole. She asks where I find 
happiness, if I don’t have God as an ultimate 
source of joy and meaning. “Any time spent 
with my girlfriend,” I tell her. “Optimism for 
the future. Interesting conversations with 
friends and strangers. The moment when 
a great piece of dance music hits its peak, 
which is probably the closest I come to how 
you felt in that room.” I pause. “Good food. 
Good books. Good company.” I look at her. 
“I think I have everything I need.” 
She nods, but I’m not sure she believes 
me. I’m not sure I believe me. I tried talking 
to God when I was young and like millions 
of others, I asked for a sign. When I didn’t 
receive it, and some of them did, I thought 
I might have missed something. Was it 
possible that I was doing something wrong?
Even after the interviews, I’m still thinking 
about Fabian’s forgiveness, Aboutorabi’s 
moral pillars, Witt’s God-shaped hole. 
I haven’t been brought to God, but I’m 
acutely conscious that the age of nineteen 
is no time to decide I understand morality. 
There are limits to my ongoing search: I am 
a scientist, I’ve seen brain scans of Buddhist 
monks, I’ve studied the neurological basis 
of near-death experience. Using terms like 
“soul” and “grace” won’t help me advance 
in my field. But even if Christian logic 
does not persuade me, that’s no excuse to 
assume that converts are the ones wearing 
ideological blinders.
I ask most of my sources what they think 
it means for someone to seek but not find.

“Without Jesus,” Fabian said at the event of her baptism, “nothing else was enough.”
