B
ill’s hand grips a microphone. He is 
calling a contra dance—a style of group 
folk dance—in the barn attached to his 
house. It is one of his monthly parties, which 
require no invitation, called “Bethany Music 
and Dance”—BMAD for short. His fuzzy 
blond dreadlocks, dotted and decorated 
with beads and string, are bunched together 
on his back. His face is wrinkled and leathery, 
the look of someone who spends more time 
outside than in. His shirt reads, “May Day 
2002, War on Terrorism, War is Terrorism.” 
His feet are bare.


We stand in the middle of the barn, 
below the arched beams of the high ceiling. 
Braided ribbons and fabrics hang on the 
walls and above the heads of the eighty-
odd people now crowding inside, ready to 
dance. Wooden sculptures of bodies dangle 
from wires attached to the ceiling. In one 
corner, there is also a paper skeleton from 
Bill’s former doctor days. The walls are 
covered in posters: an old American flag 
with the slogan, “Give it Your Best!”; fields of 
wildflowers; patchwork designs on leather; 
an old sepia portrait; yellowed and fraying 
newspaper clippings. The band is warming 
up in the corner near the fireplace; tonight it 
includes a recorder, a fiddle, a mandolin, and 
a banjo. The air is thick and hot. It smells of 
woodchips and dust, mixed with the dewy, 
late spring breeze that occasionally makes 
its way inside from the open door in the 
back. We haven’t started dancing, but Bill’s 
face already shines with sweat.


He squints at me, then smiles. “I 
recognize you now,” he says. 


In 1980, a slightly younger Bill Fischer 
had just moved back to New Haven—he 
graduated from Yale in 1966—when he and 
his wife first tried contra dancing. They were 
drawn to the live music and the community 
of 
strangers 
dancing 
and 
following 
instructions to the beat. Back then, New 
Haven had a vibrant contra dance scene, 
with dances three times a month, and a 
regular get-together for those who wanted 
to learn how to play the barn dance music. 
A decade later, Bill bought his house 
in Bethany—a small town made up of 
mostly farmland a twenty-minute drive 
from downtown New Haven. Soon, people 
started to gather at the house, mostly to 
play music: Bill plays the pennywhistle and 
recorder and his wife plays the fiddle. The 
first music party happened in September 
1991, with just ten or so people, but each 
gathering brought in more guests. The 
crowd increased most dramatically when 
another woman who held music gatherings 
left town in the late nineties; her frequenters 
heard about Bill and began meeting up at 
his house in Bethany. In the early 2000s, 
an influx that Bill calls the “undergraduate 
brushfire” 
started. 
Now, 
amateur 
professional musicians alike jam in the many 
cluttered rooms of his house one Friday a 
month, along with students and former 
medical patients of Bill’s. Some are BMAD 
regulars, others heard about the dance 
on CouchSurfing.org. Bill himself does not 
seem bothered by the crowd.


“The whole thing’s evolved, but there’s 
no way to stop it,” he says. “It’s word of 
mouth, and people will find out about it. No 
one has squatting rights.” 


He talks about his house as if he doesn’t 
own it all; on dance nights, it belongs 
equally to whoever passes in and out. He is 
loyal to the space, but he is more invested 
in the connections people make through his 
gatherings.


Four years after I hold 
Bill Fischer’s hand for the first 
time, he learns my name.
 	
“Dana? Diane?” He asks.

the new journal
The night Bill learns my name, I wander 
in from the highway, which is lined with cars 
on both sides, to find his backyard buzzing 
with people.	


I walk inside. There are dried roses 
and scooped-out gourds scattered along 
open surfaces, and various fur pelts hang 
in the sitting room that the door opens 
into. Toward the kitchen, brownies, grapes, 
zucchini bread, chips, macaroni and cheese, 
and more cover a table above a brightly 
patterned cloth. In a small room adjacent to 
the kitchen, four people are playing Simon 
& Garfunkel songs. On the wall a sign reads, 
“No smoking, no loitering, no hair combing.” 
In the living room, someone is playing a 
piano by the fireplace. Everywhere, people 
are talking, laughing, filling up empty yogurt 
containers with water, trying to fit through 
the crowd to get to the stairs, looking at 
posted newspaper clippings, asking each 
other’s names, if they’ve ever been here, if 
they’re from New Haven. 


Around ten, word spreads that the 
dancing will start soon. Some wander 
up the narrow staircase and through the 
hallway toward the barn. As people fill the 
room, Bill begins practicing scales into the 
microphone near the band. 


“Real estate is an important consideration. 
Is anyone too cold?” Bill says.


People smirk. It is the end of May, and 
every person’s face shines with sweat.


“Let’s be careful now, okay? Not just 
with the band but with each other,” he 
continues. We are bunched together in 
the barn so close to one another you can 
hardly stand without your back brushing up 
against someone else.


The person I’m paired with, John, stares 
in disbelief at the bare feet of the man to 
my left.


“Kind of risky, don’t you think, room this 
crowded, to have bare feet like that?” he 
asks. 


The man with the bare feet is dancing 
with a middle-aged woman in a strappy 
floral dress that reaches her calves. Her 
brown hair sticks to her neck, and the 
combination of her giddy smile, hazy blue 
eyes, and sweat-soaked skin makes her look 
slightly delirious. Bill calls for us to step 
toward new partners. The woman looks 
at me with her head tilted, and says hello, 
extending the last syllable as she steps 
back. When we step toward each other 
again, she says, “You’re beautiful.” Then we 
grab each other’s forearms for a left-hand 
star. Sometimes the moves switch quickly, 
but anyone can join in and follow along. The 
one rule of contra dancing, Bill says, is that if 
you’re smiling, you’re doing it right.


At the end of the dance, Bill says that it’s 
time to find a new partner. 


“If you have a boy and a girl, the boy is on 
the left. If you have a same-gender couple, 
bravo.”


The music starts again, but Bill yells 
to stop: someone in the middle is alone. 
Bodies shift until everyone is paired. My new 
partner is lanky, and a few years older than 
me. He has a red beard and his hair is pulled 
back into a bun. It’s his first time here, and 
he tells me he heard about contra dance 
through word of mouth. 


“This is better than a chat room!” he 
says, as we do-si-do.


He has dark wings on the back of his 
shirt from sweat. This dance opens up into 
two circles, with mostly men on the inside

and mostly women on the outside. Partners 
hit right hands like high fives, then hit left 
hands, then hit both hands, then both hit 
their hands against their own thighs each 
three times, then the partners swing. The 
women on the outside rotate around the 
circle, so that we swing and dance with 
half of the dancers. You learn a lot about 
a person by the way they swing—whether 
they jolt you back and forth, hold you with 
a solid hand on your back, wait for you to 
determine the pace, spin tightly around 
one foot, jump into the middle of the circle 
and skip. There are the 
uncertain ones who are 
scared to hold you close 
and the ones who make 
you fly. 


I dance with a man 
named Jonah, who asks 
at the end, “where have 
these people been all of 
my life?”


We finish the loop and arrange ourselves 
for a new dance, a new partner. Before we 
begin, Bill tells us to look down.


“That’s your home,” he says. “Remember 
it, because you’ll have to find your home 
this time.” 


That music and dance bring people 
together is no surprise, but it can be hard 
work sometimes, this business of getting 
strangers to hold hands, to see each other. 
There are different strategies. I’ve seen 
some try improvised dance or movement, 
which focuses on freeing the body and mind 
from habitual motion, entering a space to 
discover new possibilities of movement and 
interaction. Others use games or spaces 
of play to ease the interaction between 
strangers: a group in Pittsburgh called 
Obscure Games calls this “social grease.” 
It’s a rare space where I’ve forgotten to 
be stingy with my love, to save my social 
self for designated social time. I live so 
much of my life in New Haven separated 
from strangers; here, walls between selves 
break down. Every person in the room is 
a potential conversation or connection. 


As we accept the night’s many gifts, like 
homemade lemonade in an old yogurt 
container, we forget that we don’t know 
each other. Instead, we hold hands, skip and 
swirl, swing and dance, find our home. 


The first time I meet Bill in daylight is the 
day after he learns my name. I am surprised 
by the quiet in the house. I hear the screen 
door slam behind me.


“Bill?” I call. The pelt of a wolf I’ve never 
noticed hangs in front of me. I can see its 
nose, where its eyes would have been.


Bill wanders into the kitchen with 
no shirt and no shoes, 
wearing a pair of soccer 
shorts. He gives me a hug, 
and I say how strange it is 
to be here during the day, 
how quiet it is.


“That’s 
a 
common 
reaction,” he says, as he 
pours coffee into his drip 
machine. 


We lean against the counter and talk 
about his years at Yale, some trouble he got 
into for drinking, his stint traveling around 
Alaska, his life in medical school, then as 
a doctor. With coffee in ceramic mugs, 
we wander out into his sun-streaked yard. 
A pen falls out of the bun on my neck. He 
picks it up and laughs.


“Lord knows what could fall out of my 
hair.”


We sit on a bench hanging from a tree 
in the shade, looking out into the swaying 
grasses of his yard where the maypole 
stands. I try to understand why people treat 
each other so kindly at Bill’s when strangers 
so often ignore each other. Bill’s theory is 
that “usual social niceties are subsumed in 
music and motion.”


He continues, “Social dancing, it’s not 
like disco, where you’re dancing by yourself 
or with a more dedicated partner. This is 
choreographed, and there’s some bozo with 
a microphone telling you what to do.”


He says that the warmth of the 
community is amplified by the fact that 
you have to dance with many partners 
throughout the evening. He laughs when he 
finds out that I went to my first dance as a
