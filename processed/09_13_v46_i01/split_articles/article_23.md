Those who heard God’s voice—Witt, Fabian, 
a few others—tell me not to give up, that if I 
remain open to possibility, I might well hear 
something. 

I’m standing in Toad’s Place on Sunday 
morning to watch Kim Fabian’s baptism. The 
church band plays catchy, original Christian 
rock; Witt, sitting on the bar beside me, 
sings along. When the music stops, the lead 
singer—Pastor Justin Kendrick—delivers a 
moving sermon on the meaning of baptism.

Music swells again as the first worshipper 
steps forward for a pre-baptism interview 
with Pastor Justin. Witt slides off the bar 
and rushes away toward him, saying, “I’ve 
got to be baptized. Bye!” She had just come 
intending to watch her friend, but the sense 
of religious urgency in the room drew her in, 
and even I’m beginning to feel it; my heart 
is racing.

Fabian takes a microphone and relates 
her story to the congregation: “I just couldn’t 
do it by myself. Without Jesus, nothing else 
was enough.” She steps off the stage, and 
is dipped into a blue plastic tub. Toad’s 
echoes with cheering and applause. Every 
member of the congregation stretches a 
hand in Fabian’s direction. She holds hers 
out to heaven.

Witt is next on stage. “I don’t know how 
to tell this story,” she tells Pastor Justin. 
“Words are just completely insufficient to 
describe the experience.” 

For now, words are all I’ve got.
