that can trace its lineage back to Barnum 
and Bailey’s Circus, in the 1920s.
He needs to learn, Clark jokes, that he 
doesn’t want to kill us. 
In May 2012, a bobcat kitten was found 
wandering alone by the side of a highway 
in Connecticut, his mother likely killed by a 
passing car. The Connecticut Department 
of Energy and Environmental Protection 
picked up the orphan, and for lack of a 
wildlife rehabilitation center in the area, 
called the Beardsley Zoo. Custody of the 
three-week-old transferred to Deputy Zoo 
Director Don Goff and his wife Janet. The 
Goffs, experienced animal rehabilitators, 
bottle-fed the kitten for the next seven 
weeks. He was named BeeZe, after the 
initials of his new home and employer.
The bobcat (Lynx rufus) has a range that 
encompasses the continental United States, 
southern Canada, and parts of Mexico. The 
Connecticut population is concentrated 
in the northwest corner of the state. In 
the last year, there have been sightings in 
Milford, Winchester, and North Haven. A 
shy and solitary species, the bobcat is at its 
most active just after dusk or before dawn, 
preferring areas dense with young brush. 
Seeking the spotlight is 
not in its nature. A wild 
bobcat would prefer not 
to interact with humans 
at all.
A normal kittenhood 
for BeeZe might have 
begun in a nest of dried 
leaves or moss. He would 
have lived for three to 
eleven days with his eyes 
still closed, and nursed 
alongside 
his 
siblings 
for the next sixty days. 
At 
about 
twenty-eight 
days old, he might have 
started to venture out of 
the rock crevice or hollow 
log that housed the den. 
By the time a new year came around, he 
likely would have left his mother’s territory, 
making room for the new litter already on 
the way.
At the zoo, the trajectory of BeeZe’s 
kittenhood has been extensively planned. 
The staff maintains a neatly labeled binder 
of BeeZe’s records dating back to his arrival, 
including his training schedule, medical 
information, and handling log, where they 
note any instance when they’ve made 
direct physical contact with him since his 
arrival. The records provide insight into 
a life of prevailing strangeness. BeeZe 
is constantly being met with some new 
experience that no wild bobcat would 
expect to encounter, like the rumble of a 
golf cart, the sight of someone in a baseball 
cap, or the mere, befuddling existence of 
stairs—an architectural feature for which he 
has no instinctive physical response. Each 
encounter initially terrified him.
BeeZe has training once in the morning 
and once in the late afternoon, sometimes 
with a third session in between. Three 
times a day, he’s fed a meal of ground-up 
horsemeat: breakfast can occur anytime 
between seven and nine, lunch between 
twelve and four, and dinner between four 
and nine. The schedule can’t be too regular, 
or he’ll become “regimented,” expecting 
food at an exact time each day and 
making his performances more difficult to 
schedule. Mondays are his day off. Having 
been adequately socialized, BeeZe will help 
educate visitors—most of them residents 
of Connecticut—about an animal that they 
may one day glimpse in their own backyard. 
Dancho, the zoo director, is quick to 
frame BeeZe’s story as an opportunity born 
out of necessity.
“BeeZe was a special, specific case,” he 
says. “He was a baby when he was brought 
here. So, at that point, we could just decide: 
it could go as a collection animal or it can go 
into programming. And the staff said, ‘let’s 
try to do this, and we’ll see what happens.’”
Dancho’s 
slip 
between 
pronouns, 
though 
accidental, 
reflects the uncertainty of 
BeeZe’s status between 
self-governing being and 
object, wild animal and 
pet. His trainers frequently 
emphasize his essential 
wildness, 
claiming 
that 
a 
bobcat 
cannot 
be 
domesticated—but at the 
same time, they remain 
leery of socializing BeeZe too thoroughly.
“If they’re too wild, then an injury could 
happen to them or to the handler, or to 
somebody,” says Dancho, “If they’re too 
much of a pet, then psychologically, they 
get damaged because they don’t know 
what they are.”
Sitting together in one of Beardsley’s 
classrooms, Dancho recounts the classic 
case of Travis the chimpanzee. Raised 
as a member of his owners’ household, 
Travis had acquired a number of uncannily 
human behaviors, like drinking wine from a 
stemmed glass. It’s believed that once he hit 
puberty, over-socialization and testosterone 
pushed the primate into violence, leading to 
a much-publicized incident in 2009 when he 
mauled a friend of the family whom he had 
known for years. Travis might be an extreme 
case, given chimpanzees’ intelligence and 
deep genetic similarities to humans. It may 
be more difficult to assess psychological 
damage to a bobcat, and more difficult to 
inflict it. But the zoo staff remains cautious. 
Dancho insists, “We want the animal to 
remain knowing it’s a bobcat. It’s important 
to do that.” There are strict rules for how 
visitors conduct themselves with BeeZe: 
“No cuddling, no hugging, no kissing. No 
touching with the hands.”
A good animal ambassador doesn’t let 
relations between his species and humans 
get too chummy.
Teaching a bobcat that he doesn’t want 
to kill you can be a full-time job. During the 
most crucial stretch of a kitten’s bonding 
period, it is imperative that he be exposed 
to humans even after Beardsley closes each 
day at 4 p.m. Left behind at the zoo for long 
and lonely overnights, the 
bobcat might not become 
properly socialized. For 
BeeZe’s first summer and 
autumn, Chris Clark, his 
primary caretaker, drove 
to and from work with 
a bobcat riding in back.  
Clark is on the staff of 
Beardsley’s 
education 
department, where she 
has years of experience working with 
animals and children, both at the zoo and in 
the classroom. Because of her background 
in training dogs for a K-9 unit, Clark was an 
intuitive choice for the job.
“You have to be a little nuts to try to 
do this,” she admits. “But it really is the 
opportunity of a lifetime.”
When she returned home at the end of 
the day, Clark would let the bobcat loose 
for a few hours. Unleashing his energy is 
essential both to BeeZe’s overall happiness 
and his good behavior. Clark believes that 
allowing the bobcat to jump on the furniture 
and generally behave as he likes enables 
him to work at the zoo with renewed 
concentration. He can walk on a leash, sit 
still for photos, and go into his carrier when 
directed. As the owner of several dogs and 
cats, Clark runs an exceptionally pet-friendly 
household: plenty of cardboard boxes to 
play with, no fragile tchotchkes.
“Luckily enough, my house is an open-
floor plan,” she says, “So he can run around

like an idiot.” 
Sometimes, one of Clark’s German 
shepherds would wrestle and roughhouse 
with him. When the dog overpowered 
BeeZe, she laid her forearms along his body, 
pinning the bobcat to the ground. When 
BeeZe overpowered the dog, he jumped 
on her hindquarters and launched himself 
to execute a perfect spin in midair; then 
he went for the throat. Clark has always 
been able to verbally intervene before 
anything’s gotten “too crazy,” and BeeZe 
has never bitten hard. Pairing big cats and 
domesticated dogs is not an uncommon 
practice: cheetahs at the San Diego and 
Houston Zoos have “companion canines” 
with whom they play. Still, the tussles never 
fail to impress.
“You realize,” she says matter-of-factly, 
“How an animal of his size can take down a 
full-grown deer.”
None of this fazes Clark, who discusses 
BeeZe with imperturbable humor and 
affection. While maintaining that, “I can’t get 
into his little brain,” she is an experienced 
reader of his body language and moods. 
She recalls, “When he was a baby, he would 
get over-tired from play and not realize he 
would need to take a nap. He would get 
cranky, like a human child. You would scoop 
him into his bed for a nappie, and he would 
get obnoxious.” 
Bearing Dancho’s rules in mind, I ask if 
bobcat kittens like being hugged.
“Well, their moms scoop them into the 
fold and groom them,” Clark says, “and the 
worst thing that could happen during a 
program is he gets scared and he gets loose.” 
Clark explains that her hug communicates 
to BeeZe that “I’m the mom, everything’s 
safe. I will protect you.”
A zoo occupies a slippery position on 
the continuum between domesticity and 
wildness: it’s a sanctuary with reinforced 
borders, an intensively managed series of 
dioramas, a nonprofit organization that 
must entertain to survive. The modern 
zoo justifies its existence by measuring its 
distance from its crueler, more exploitative 
forebears: the traveling circus, the private 
menagerie, the drive-thru amusement park.
BeeZe’s home bears an uncomfortably 
close resemblance to those cheap public 
entertainments. 
James 
W. 
Beardsley 
donated one hundred acres of land to 
Bridgeport in 1878, architect Frederick Law 
Olmstead drew up designs for the park in 
1884, and Parks Commissioner Wesley F. 
Hayes proposed the zoo in 1920—but the 
name that looms largest is that of Phineas T. 
Barnum, the impresario who sold millions of 
tickets to his circus after he acquired its most 
famous performer, Jumbo the Elephant. 
Barnum and Bailey’s animals wintered in 
the city, and legend has it that the keepers 
exercised their charges in the streets. 
Residents would spread picnic blankets on 
the grounds of Beardsley Park to watch the 
parade from “The Greatest Show on Earth”: 
big cats and giraffes, elephants and zebras. 
The public’s enthrallment to the spectacle 
purportedly inspired the establishment of 
the Beardsley Zoo. Barnum contributed 
a camel to its founding collection, and a 
number of circus retirees would join the 
zoo’s ranks over the years.
Beardsley was formally taken over by 
the city of Bridgeport in the 1920s, and its 
exhibits and attitudes stayed stuck in that 
era through the 1980s, when the federal 
Department of Agriculture found it in 
violation of new licensing requirements. 
Animals ranged on concrete, in overcrowded 
cages. Main roads passed right next to the 
exhibits. Families entered by driving directly 
into the zoo, and children would leave their 
cars, check both ways for oncoming traffic, 
and run right up to the cages. Beardsley’s 
layout put the entertainment of the public 
first, reflecting the outdated assumption that 
a clean cage and full food bowl represented 
the extent of an animal’s needs.
“There was no rhyme or reason to the 
exhibits,” Dancho says, recalling childhood 
visits to the zoo after church on Sundays. 
“They were basically random.” He gestures 
to various buildings along the walkways, 
where there was once a Mouse House, a 
petting zoo, and at one point, a Wizard 
of Oz-themed exhibit. “There was no 
place to have an educational program, no
