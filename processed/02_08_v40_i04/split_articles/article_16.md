As CA.\IP Y.\LR "JNos ro A o.osr, HACH fall, 
a few hundred wide-eyed freshmen gather 
m Sheffield-Sterling-Strathcona Hall for 
what has been billed as a "security meet-
ing." Upperclassmen cavon across the 
stage pretending to be bike racks and lap-
top Jocks. Their skits are destgned to im 
pan helpful safety tips: don't walk alone 
at night, always shut your door, and tn an 
emergency, use a blue phone to directly 
connect to campus police. 

Four months--or 
four years-
aftetwa.rd, few srudents "'ill have made 
use of that last ptece of advice. Though 
the comforong blue glow of a campus 
emergency phone is visible from most 
places on campus, Yale srudents rarely 
confront crisis directly. In the era of cell 
phones, there is somedung quaint about 
the nooon that students would rurn to a 
public telephone m the1r hours of need. 

According to Susan Dana Burhan~. 
manager or"security educaoon at Yale, blue 
phones were first mstalled in the 1990s 
and arc still used frequently-though 
not for the reasons one would expecL As 
blue phones can connect to any campus 
number, Burhans explains, most callers 
use blue phones ro make general campus 
calls, rather than summon the YPD. "The 
phones are used quite often because they 
are converuent and the calls are free," 
Burhans says. She even promotes blue 
phones as "a good way to save on your 
cell minutes." 

Anecdotal 
evidence 
supports 
Burham's claim. Freshman Alexa Chu 
8 
used a blue phone to call maintenance 
after her suitematc accidentally dropped 
several plates, lca,·ing broken glass and 
food spread across the Roor. Chu imended 
to use a cell phone, bur onlr knew the 
extension for mamtcnance, not its full 
phone number, so she used a blue phone 
instead. Another sruJcnt was recently 
spotted using an Old Campus blue phone 
while wearing only a rowel, presumably 
locked out of her room. 

Still, the stated purpme of the blue 
phones lS to improve security, not to aid 
srudents shon on cash or clothes. Indeed, 
Burhans says that blue phones ha\·e been 
helpful irnmedtately iollo\\ing incidents 
because "if an mcidcnt docs occur and 
the police respond ncar the sire, they 
have more of an opportunity to search 
the area right after the incident occurs." 
Without blue phones, victims might wait 
to call until after returning ro their dorms 
or aparunenrs. However, Burhans was at 
a loss to recall a orne \\'hen a call from a 
blue phone directly prc\·cnrcd a crime. 

Yale isn't the emir place where blue 
phones have caught on a~ a security 
measure. Colleges across the country 
are embracing them, from Oberlin (67 
phones) and Cornell (86) ro Johns Hopkins 
(32) and the L niverstt) of Chicago (327). 
Clocking in at four hundred-odd blue 
phones, Yale tops most other schools. 
Burhans is always asking students to 
contact her if they feel a phone should 
be added ro a particular location. But 
the phones aren't cheap. Although prices 
vary, installing a blue phone typically costs 
several thousand dollars. 

If this seems like a quarter- million 
dollar investment m maintenance hotlines, 
Code BlUe, a major seller of campus 
securit)· phones, defends irs products \\ith 
one word: deterrence. ,\ high!) visible 
blue phone lets the would-be criminal 
kno"'· that the art.'ll is well-secured. 

The blue phones han.· another 
purpose, too, one intended for both that 
room full of freshmen, and rhctr fretting, 
bill-paying parents. Those steady blue 
lights are comforting, whether they're an 
effective securitv me.tsurt• or not.
