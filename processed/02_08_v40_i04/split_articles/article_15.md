in the team. The money is now a fnngc 
benefit. Vuqucz, the supenrisor, says, "lt 
is probably a small incentive, but ther arc 
only making minimum wage and working 
six hours a week; they're here because 
they really \~.':lilt to be." Gizelle \\·ala 
echoes dus sentiment. "I care about what 
happens to the Hill now because I mtghr 
be able to do something about it." 

These teenagers' commitmenc to 
the group and their neighborhood stems 
partly from the sense of empowerment 
HYAT gives them. "lt's an enabler," 
Smith says of the organization. The tec:m 
feel compelled to act because they arc not 
confident adult~ arc doing enough. "The 
oty should make sure that the streets arc

their job," says Ptttman. "The Mayor and 
aldermen dcfinttcl} know about us and 
some have met with us, but nothmg has 
expliody been changed," Vazquez adds. 
"There arc a lot of good politicians, but it 
usually cakes them a while to cake spccafic 
action." 

The change HYAT wants most ts the 
creation of a communi()· center; "muh 
describes it as "a place \~.·here teem on 
go when they're having problems wuh 
their famil}, a place to do homework, 
and a place where they can just chill. If 
we're nor at home or at school, we have 
no place to be." 

"The Bop and Girls Club and Casa 
Lawu arc n.'1Uy directed to younger ktds," 
Vazque:r elaborates, "but the tccnagl'ni 
are the ones who most need ic; they llfC 
the ones who get in trouble." 

It is difficult to imagine a bettl:r place 
to design the ideal community center than 
HYATs shamelessly idealistic, rigorously 
professional meeting.; beneath the Casa 
Latina. In trying to transform the Hill, 
to foster a deeper sense o f communi()· 
among its teenage ctcizens, the group ha..;

of only nine srudents-trsel£
