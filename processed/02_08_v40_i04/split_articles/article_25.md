"\o how did you decide what to

what ro rake more direcd} from tt?" I 
asked Gwathmey. 


He laughed. "1 don't thtnk it worb 
that wa). I think that there w~b a clear 
planntng obligation." Unlike the under-
graduates, he's had ro fulfill his obligauon 
ro various Yale department:. on a nght 
orne table. 


But Frcemark sa~ s those obhgations 
were part of the problem. "Building:-. 
should not be designed on the fly. \\ hat 
the fuck!? Who can build a buildmg tn

A s Levering walks through the inter-
Il.Jocking b·els of the \& \ and the 
new Hisrory of ,\rt Buildtng from bot-

a~cends through the larger space. The ad-
cliuon I" user-friend!~. T thought. It seems 
like a grt-at place to attend class. 


The new entrance lies JUSt to the side 
of the 1ld one. It\ a bit more open and 
\\ clcomtng than the origmal entrance.

Gw:uhmt:} ·, building is a synthests

m hts <:ar, an nns\\cr to the set of clue:. he 
had to collect from Rudolph\ builcling, 
from the surrounding strcetscape, and 
from the various departments. \s Isen-
staJt ,,tvs, "lie juggles a lot, and appears 
to put them together well." 


Kahn anJ Rudolph were al\\'ays con-
cerned With ho\\ thctr buildings would 
look as ru1ns. Kahn, Purves explains, had 
trouble \\ith roofs because his favorite 
buildtngs were ruins. Rudolph's .-\&A 
has al\\ays had the stony, monumental 
aura of a ruin, whether burned out or 
b'l.lsslcd up. 


Gwarhmc} \ bmlding tsn't a ruin. It 
IS funcnonal, usable. Detractors complain 
about its form. but nobod) doubts that it 
w11l work. 


Rudolph':> building, on the other 
hand, 1S difficult. It has never '.l."Orked. lt 
IS building as $culpture. Students learn to 
Ion: it--or don't. 


The buildings embody one of the 
oldest debates in the history of archi· 
tecture. The ,\&A errs on the s1de of 
form. The addioon errs on the ~1de of 
funcoon. 


T
he A&A, for all of the serious pos-
runng in Its concrete fa<;ade. has a 
sense of humor. Rudolph thought bwld-
mgs should. It laughs at the acadenues 
trylllg to find the library, and It laughs 
u1th the students after they understand Its 
ms1de~. It had a good laugh at the pamtcrs 
and sculptors before tt threw them out. lr 
laughs at anybody who equated aesthetic~ 
to beauty. It laughs at generations of Yale 
undergraduate~ who just don't under-
stand. It laughs at its maker. dethroned 
from the U.S. architectural establishment. 
It may very \l:elllaugh at its renovator. 


The stairwell is meant to be a little: 
stde. Rudolph vellc:d, "But u\ not a public 
building." ::,rudents, only studrnts, \l.cre 
suppo cd · . Jearn what Rudolph called 
"the purpose!)' secret, lab)nnth-like et.r-
culanon sptem." 


Over orne, when one walks up that 
dank stlurwell, tt feels like \1StUng an old 
fnend. 


The new building \nil function bet· 
tcr m a traditional sense. \X hen students
