Cops started to patrol the streets 
on foot and build relationships with 
residents on a particular block. Crime 
dropped, the program's success garnered 
national press, and New Haven became, 
if not a sleepy college town, then a city 
more peaceful than it had been in recent 
memory. Twenty-one thousand crimes in 
1998 petered out to nine thousand crimes 
in 2006. 

Herman Badger, the former assistant 
chief of police, says, "We're long past 
the time when the police can just come 
in and make a community a place worth 
living." He grew up in New Haven and 
has been a cop for 23 years. He explains 
that community policing changed the 
way business was done. "There was a big 
shift from 'we're the experts' to 'we're 
partners.'" 

Total crime is still far below early '90s 
levels, but gun violence has shot up in the 
last year. And residents feel that, rather 
than redoubling their efforts in response 
to the crisis, police have retreated to their 
bunker, darting out only for emergencies, 
leaving their charges to face escalating 
crime without protection. What angers 
the Greers—and many other New Haven 
residents—is the absence of a visible 
police presence. 

This frustration reflects a drop in 
the number of cops in New Haven. A 
decrease in federal funding for local 
policing under President George Bush has 
led to fewer police walking beats in urban 
neighborhoods. The police department 
has been knocked even further off 
balance by a scandal that decimated its 
narcotics department. Last spring, the 
FBI conducted a drug raid that led to 
the arrests of three officers on charges 
of theft and bribery, the suspension of 
the operation of the department, and 
the resignations of several top officials, 
including Badger. New Haven has been 
struggling to reform its policing ever 
since. Chief Francisco Ortiz announced 
his resignation in November, but agreed 
to stay on until a replacement was found. 

The impact of these disturbances 
has been felt on the streets. The city has 
promised to increase the number of cops 
in New Haven, but Badger admitted in 
October that the department's approach 
has changed since its vigorous days of 
community policing. "We haven't gone 
back to the early nineties," he said, "but

we have become a bit more of a reactive 
department, rather than proactive." 

What disturbs City officials about 
recent crime trends is not the hard 
numbers but the new character of the 
perpetrators and the new style of their 
crimes. "We're actually seeing deliberate 
gunfire in places where you wouldn't 
before," explains Rob Smuts, DeStefano's 
youthful chief administrative officer. 
to look safe actually makes it safer. And 
the effectiveness of community-based 
policing depends as much on the visual 
aid of police on the streets, talking to 
residents, as the work they actually do 
there. 

In line with the "Broken Windows" 
thesis, Edgewood violence has been 
transmuted into a visual symbol. On one 
The mugs of men recently convicted 
of soliciting prostitution in Edgewood 
stared out from every telephone pole. 
"I like to the commission of a robbery, 
after the robbery's done. Almost in a 
marking fashion." Criminals are much 
younger, often 15 to twenty. And when 
they fire their guns, it is superfluous, 
unnecessary, dramatic. Victims are not 
being killed—they're getting shot. In the 
arm, the leg, the buttocks, the foot, the 
hand. And they're not shot at three in the 
morning, as Eliezer is prone to yell, but at 
six, seven, eight at night. 

They have been a stabilizing force," 
Elizabeth McCormack says of the 
Greers. She has been the Edgewood 
alderwoman for the last twenty years. 
"And then there's the domino effect. They 
paint their houses and someone says, 'Oh, 
their house looks nice. I guess I'll paint 
mine!'" 

Stepping outside of McCormack's 
house on Pendleton Avenue, it's easy 
to get a sense of what she means. The 
forty Greer-owned properties dot the 
neighborhood. After a few days, it's hard 
not to see the family's houses sticking out 
like sore thumbs against a mish-mash of 
dilapidation. The trademark red, beige, 
green, and mushroom houses stand 
as an affirmation of some community 
standard. 

The police, too, lend credence to the 
visual, if not as explicitly. The "Broken 
Windows" theory, which emerged at 
the same time as community policing, 
is an aesthetic one, espousing the once-
radical idea that fixing up a neighborhood 
tour through the neighborhood, driving 
along Whalley Avenue's grimy neon drag, 
Eliezer says, "Right here is something 
we call 'kids that are bored.'" He grabs a 
flashlight off the dashboard and beams 
the light like a teacher using a pointer. 
"These kids are bored." 

Out on the sidewalk, in front of 
Planet Apizza's sterile glow, two black, 
male teenagers, draped in their small bikes, 
stare back. Greer leans out the passenger 
seat to fix them in the flashlight's glare. 
"It's unlikely they're going to buy pizza 
for their parents. It's more likely that 
they're bored." 

As he coasts along, Greer reels off 
anecdotes of recent violence: A car 
crashes through a house. Bullets fly 
through an alderwoman's home. A rabbi 
is held up at Lighthouse. A shooting breaks 
out on Rosh Hashanah. 

But despite these dramatic events, 
black kids on bikes—doing nothing—
have become an icon of incipient chaos. 
In High Point, North Carolina, where 
recent police efforts have stamped out 
rampant crime, a resident was quoted in 
the Wall Street Journal as saying, "I don't 
know exactly how to phrase it, but you 
just don't see as many people riding 
around doing nothing." 

At a block watch meeting in the 
Norton substation, Bill Morris, a stooped, 
retired high school teacher with a few 
wisps of white hair on his head, demands 
of the small group, "Where are these

kids out on the street at two and three in the 
morning! My mother would've had my 
hide if I acted like that." A few others 
nod. Gone are the days, distant but keenly 
felt, when neighbors would put kids' 
bicycles left on the sidewalk safely onto 
their owner's porch. 

Shortly after launching their patrol, the 
Greers called Curtis Sliwa, founder 
of national community watchdog group 
the Guardian Angels and invited him 
to run a chapter in New Haven. The 
Guardian Angels began in the subways 
of New York in 1979, when Sliwa turned 
February 2008 
his cleaning crew into a dozen patrol 
that rode the Manhattan lines and grew 
into an international phenomenon. Sliwa 
accepted the Greers' offer, and Sliwa and 
Eliezer were soon standing side-by-side at 
press conferences. 

The divergence between the two 
groups' ideologies, however, is marked by 
guns. The Guardian Angels are adamantly 
unarmed, but they do not hesitate to 
make arrests, confiscate drugs, or use 
physical force. The Greers, on the other 
hand, have yet to make physical contact 
with any of their targeted delinquents. 
Guns, tucked inside their coats, they spent 
five months walking within the borders 
of Ellsworth, Edgewood, West Park, and 
Whalley, politely asking boys on bikes to 
move along. The Greers' guns were not a 
practical necessity but a political avowal 
that as long as the police remained absent, 
the Greers would remain conspicuously, 
militantly present. 

Eliezer uses the word "control" a 
lot. Yet as he drives the streets, one man 
yelling from the sidewalk manages to 
unnerve him. He speaks with increasing 
vehemence and agitation. "Let's get the 
state in here and do a narcotics raid! 
Big deal? No. For a big deal what's a 
big deal is nobody's running the police 
department. And they don't want to do 
anything! They want to sit around." 

The rise in violence hits home for 
the Greers. Despite all their efforts 
to enact community norms, there will 
always be uncontrollable elements that 
seep through. Ellsworth, Edgewood, 
West Park, Whalley. These borders are 
permeable. The guns were a defensive cry 
against this basic truth. 

What the Greers have always wanted 
is systemic change, a top-down solution 
to their problems. In their eyes, Ortiz's 
announcement of his resignation was the 
first step toward a repentant, renovated 
police department, and so they laid off 
the political trigger. In November, they 
put down their guns. 

When asked whether the EPDP 
contributed to Ortiz's departure, Eliezer 
beams, calmer than he has been in weeks. 
"Absolutely, absolutely," he says. I asked 
him if any residents were disappointed 
that the EPDP was disarming. "Sure," he 
shrugged. "But I can't go door to door 
and explain all our policy decisions to 
everyone." The Greers are playing on a 
larger stage than just the streets of the 
Edgewood neighborhood. 

While their first act has been a success, 
they have no interest in quitting their task 
until the streets are safe, the police have 
returned for good, and Edgewood looks 
like they remember it.
