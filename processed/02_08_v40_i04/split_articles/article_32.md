en members of the Yale 
X'omen's Center Executive 
Board circulated Zeta Psi's 
now notonous ''\Ve Love Yale Sluts" 
photo on January 20, the} hoped to cast 
a critical eye on an emblemaoc image. 
Instead, after weeks of public dispute, the 
gaze has swerved back to the protesters. 
The Women's Center has been challenged 
for its intenoon to file suit, its criocs have 
been accused of insensitivit}·. and Yale is 
muggling to define the boundaries of 
this sexual dtalogue. Such disputes are not 
m:w to New J Iaven. The Elm City brims 
\\ith lund tales of sexual controversies 
and their dubious mcarnations. 


The fim predates Yale. From 1640 
to 1643, when four our of seven New 
Haven re~idcnts were men, the Colony 
experienced what historian John Murrm 
calls "something close to a bestiality 
panic." ~ew Haven was one of the world's 
most harshlr Puritanical societies, and 
tts authorities frcquendy handed do\\n 
!'.evere purushments for a variety of sex 
crimes, includmg sodom}; masrurbaoon, 
and zoophilia. Perhap< a victim of 
htstoocal circumstll.llcc; perhap~ bhnded 
by an unseeml} feosh, a one-eyed servant 
named George Spencer became the 
t:uget of one o: the most pubhc bestiality 
trul.s of the sevemeenth cenn..r Long 
a nuisance to his communir", 'lpencer 
came to the attention of authoones in 
l"a.dy 1641 when his neighbor remarked 
that one of his sO\\·'s new~m p~ets 
bore a scrilcing resemblance ·o pencec's 
di.~figured visage. Concluding that "the 
monster'' must be Spencer's offspnng, the 
ne1ghbor explained the story: "Spencer 
being there an worke, the sow came into 
the stable, and then the temptaoon and 
his corruption did worke, and he drove 
the sow into the srye, and then comitted 
thatt filthyness." 


Though some historians contend that 
the charges against Spencer would not 
have held in a more moderate religious 
climate, "JC\\ Haven authoocies probed 
the servant with zeal. Interrogated by a 
group of religious leaders, including men 
named Yale and Davenport. Spencer 
\\1IS condemned for much more th:m his 
penchant for detlo\l.·ermg sows. In court. 
rumors ran rampant· Spencer had not 
been to church in five years, he had been 
whipped m Boston for stealing goods: he 
had attempted to a~ from his ~enitude 
to Virginia. Ultimately finding him guilty 
of "smfull and aborrunable filthyness," 
the New Han:n court delivered the 
punishment demanded 
by 
Leviticus 
20:15: Spencer \\"aS to die, but not before 
wtmessmg the public slaying of his 
promiscuous sow. 


Founded in the wake of spectacular 
New Haven trials like Spencer's, Yale 
eventually confronted tts own cases of 
se:-.-ual transgression. '\;or surprisingly, 
definitions of de"1ance have proven 
wildly elastic over time. In 1821, Yale's 
disctplinary tribunal expelled Alfred N. 
Bullitt for "criminal intercourse wtth a 
female of abandoned character." Such 
"abandoned" 
young 
women--often 
factory girb or New Haven prostitutes-
frustrated Yale authorities throughout the 
runeteenth century and ~ent more than 
one Yale man from the tn~titution. 


A ccnfur} later, as heud shepherded 
formerly unspeakable sexual tssues into 
the mainstream and World War I placed 
a 
renewed emphas1s on traditional 
masculinit}·, the t;niversit}· stepped up 
its puni~hment of homosexual behavior. 
In April 1923, John \\ tlltam Herron 
and Theodore SrudweU Smith were 
suspended for the remainder of the 
year after being comicted of "improper 
proceedings in their room.'' 


While 
undergraduate regulations ne\·er explicitly 
forbade gay sex, disc1plmar:y guidelines 
were ambiguously worded to condemn 
cri.minally effeminate behavior while 
avoiding the ugly bu~mcss of naming 
the d~d . ·~\ny breach of the commonly 
accepted rules of gentlemanly behavior," 
the rule~ read, "whether or not covered 
by the'e regulation~, \\iU be subject to 
di'aplinary action." 


Considering the official tolerance of both heterosexual anc.l 
homo,exual relationship~ at the Uni' e~>i() 
toJay, the case~ of wayward Yale men 
exemplify the power cultural context can 
ncrt on the judgment of transgressions. 
\'\hen the mtimate realm of sexual 
bcltanor is exposc.-d and condemned, the 
private become> the public. and a forum 
10 which to recon .. d~:r and renegotiate 
fund:unemal ~ocul value> emerges. 


In the case ot ">pencer's unfortunate 
indiscretion, 
t\.e\\ 
H:wen's 
Punran 
community r:w-ned him inro a scapc.goat 
and hb rrial uuo a reaffirmation of such 
\'lrtucs as piet). good\\11~ and hard \\ · trk. 
Hter a year of Impnsonmenr. Spc1ccr 
stood at the gallows. Face to face with 
dt."ath, he urged the people of ~C\\" 
Haven to take a more righteous path than 
he h:~d. According to the record. "He 
bc.pn to speakc to the }Ouths abom htm. 
exorring them all to take.: warning by h1s 
ex:unple hou• the) neglect and despise 
the mt"llnes of Grace. and rherr s•>ulcs 
good as he had done.·." Finally, SpLncer 
admitted "his ~mpud~.:ncy and athe1smc," 
rhen "justified the sentence as righn:ou'. 
und fully confessed." 


\ccording to !'iooologr Professor 
Philip Smith, cases h.ke Spencer's offer 
a platform for the 
retr~.:nchment of 
communal ideology. ''The case can be 
made," Smith explains, "that ,;s1ble 
trials m such cases help to sc.:dirnent new 
understandings and ro offer an exLmplaf} 
narrative to the pubhc." \s '\ew Haven 
authorities fined the noo'c. cghd: u-ound 
Spencer's neck and ktcked away the !>tand, 
they scaled the rdig10u~ and social nlues 
of the communtty with rhe blood of one 
of irs member.;. "::\ow he was ready w

In 1642. Spencer dangled limply for 
a colonial crowd as a public reaffirmation 
of pic(). In 1923, John Herron and 
TheoJore Smith packed their trunks and 
qu1etl) \\1thdrc\\ fwm Yale so that the 
orthodoxy of gentlemanly behavior could 
be pre,c.>rved. \s the contro\·ersy simmers

rhat characterized the public trials of 
our past. Reflecting on the reactions she

Pcrhap~ an affirmation 
of socral Yrrtues wJil once again evade 
us. Yale ts beyond publtc hangings and 
homophobic regulanons, but the myriad 
n.•acuons to "\'\'c love Yale sluts" have 
rC\ caled a hmt of conflicting ideals
