basement of Welch Hall and talk to C.J. 
May about his team of srudenr waste 
manager:;. you might not be sure whether 
he\ discussing #6 Plastics or 00"'. In 
fact, he's talking about both, although his 
vcrsion of Bond comes equipped ·with 
garbage tongs and safety glasses, and is 
probably not wcarirg a ruxedo. 

\"\elcome 
to 
world 
of 
emironmcntal esptonagc. It's a glamorous 
adc for what amounts ro sifting through 
fr.l!;h. 

~lay, head of Yale's recycling 
program. is looking for a new way to 
confront an old problem: How do we 
make ~ure that our recyclables, carefullr 
placed in their blue, green, and brown 
bins, don't end up going out with the 
trash? 

According to .\lay, the ~olution lies 
m undercover reconnaissance. He grabs a 
leaf of bnght orange paper from his desk, 
and marks it v.ith the date. These sheets, 
crumpled up and planted 10 recycling bins 
by a coven group of Yale students, sen·e 
as tracking de"-ices. After the custo<lian 
takes out the recycling, these agents of 
ceo-espionage wait to ~ee whether the 
orange papers end up in the outdoor 
recycling bins where they belong. 

~fay draws his inspiration for dus 
operation from legendary aquatic explorer 
Jacques-Yves Cousteau. Cousteau, May 
tells me, once used blue dye to prove that 
an inland water hole was connected to the 
ocean. "He just watched, and followed 
where it led," May says. These bits of 
orange confetti are May's blue dye, and 
they have resulted in ~orne serious findings. 
Of ten buildings surveyed in the fall, five 
had custodial reams caught tossing their 
recycling into outdoor dumpsters. This, 
May emphasize~, is a crime. Recycling 
has been mandatory in Conneccicut since 
1991, when the state had the worst record 
of garbage inaneration in the nanon. 

May hopes that the "sting operation." 
as he calls it, will help hun gather enough 
hard data to find and plug the "leaks in the 
pipe" that prevent successful recycling at 
Yale. He takes the task seriously, amassmg 
evtdence as one would in a criminal trial 
and relymg on eyev.itness accounts as 
often as possible . .\fay also takes safety 
seriously. He urges me to enroll in a 
course on blood-borne pathogens if I am 
interested in joining his ream of agents. 
Delicately grabbing the edge of an invisible 
(yet somehow believably weighty) bag of 
rrash between two fingers, he mimes for 
me the correct way of handling waste to 
avoid being hurr by, say, shards of glass or 
hypodermic needles. 

Currently, the team is tiny; only two 
studentS are responsible for inspecting all 
of Yale's buildings. The more experienced 
of the two P.I.'s is a divmity ~chool 
student who, stuck in ~ew Haven over 
winter break, took advantage of Yale's 
dead campus to step up his recon '':ork. 
Operating without a uniform, he was not 
received well by building supervi.~ors, 
who saw nothing more than a stranger 
peeking into their trash. A saintly smile 
February 2008 
widens across his face as he admits that 
supenisors have called the police on 
him. 

:\lay is boss of another ~quad of 
recycling nuts-the Student Taskforce for 
Environmental Partnerslup . .\lay doesn't 
tap into the pool of STEP coordinators 
to expand the program. STLP has a 
different agenda, he explams. They're 
responsible for education in the colleges-
for distributing mi.xed·paper bms and 
Buorescem bulbs and for throwing study 
breaks. "STEP coordinators arc like 
cheerleaders," he says. "\X'e need these 
guys to be like FBI agents." 

\!though 
"spy" is a word that makes coordinators 
cringe, 1\.lay offers it up freely, even 
proudly, to his waste team. 

The program is not May's first effort 
at recychng regulation. The boldness of 
the ·waste inspeccions 1s a far leap from 
the more transparent effort that .\lay 
dubbed "recycling for muffins." He used 
to vtsit a number of sites daily, asking 
to inspect \vaste and offering pastnes 
to the building with the best recycling 
record. The program was popular among 
custo<lians and long after irs termination, 
.\lay had people calling to ask. "When arc 
you gomg to bring back the muffins?" 

~owadays, if he visitS a workplace, 
askmg about rrash and offering muffins, 
the responses are guarded. e\·en hostile. 
People who want to look through trash 
are seen as lunatics, psychopaths. potential 
terroristS; "l.ve fear anthrax in our waste 
bms and rat poison in our baked goods. 
No, muffins don't cut tt these day~. 

So l\lay's vision has cvoh·ed. Today, 
salvation depends on C.J.'s angels. ,\r the 
end of my \-isit, one of them scops by to 
tip off May about a bUtlding he suspects 
is mishandling its recychng. May potnb 
to his modest waste team. "This is when: 
they come in!" His excitement conjures an 
image-beautiful--of waste inspecrors 
in slick black uniforms descmding on 
ropes from a helicopter that hovers ju~t 
above an offending site. Hi~ eyes stray 
upward, pulled by the magnetic power of 
this fantasy-and then he laughs. Back to 
earth, back to the bowels of \\~c:lch Hall.
