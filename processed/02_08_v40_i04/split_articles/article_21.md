Still, H \\'E'\ lS not a panacea. In 
facmg the effects of the ICE raids on 
Fair Ha,·en residents, eYen community 
clinics fell short. Tre,-ino, the young, 
elegantly-dressed executive director of 
Junta. worked ,,·ith children traumatized 
br the raid~. "These children were woken 
up by officers screaming and yelling at 
si.-.; o'clock in tl1e morning and slamming 
ilirough rht:1r doors ,,,th guns." Trevino 
formed a suppon group for the children, 
but some whom she referred to therapy 
waited months for appointments. "There 
is negligence in the health care system 
difficult for families and it can be quire 
scary for them," says Novelo. "They don't 
understand what's happening with the 
kids." 

Having learned to navigate the U.S. 
for themselves, immigrants who 
stay tO build families find a new ser 
of struggles. Undocumented parents 
struggle to obtain welfare services for 
their American-born children. Though, 
as citizens, these children are entitled to 
health care, undocumented parents don't 
know how to sign their children up for

of the cuy." She speaks softly but 
emphaocally. "\\'hat happens to a child 
who's gomg through a mental health 
chaos right now?" 

\s Trevino's story illustrates, New 
Haven faces a chronic shortage of 
bilingual rherapists. Patricia Novelo heads 
the L-mno clinic at Clifford Beers, a local 
mental health cemer for children and 
families. She radmtes calm as she stops tO 
talk to children 10 the wainng room, but 
she Jcscnbes her job as a scramble to fit 
in more appointments. "\\'e ha,·e about a 
six-month wmting list at this point ... a few 
months ago we had about a year waiting 
list." 

Shortages 
make 
the 
system 
inefficient. If public schools had a large 
enough bilingual staff. they would not 
refer so man) families ro Clifford Beers. 
If Clifford Beers had a large enough 
bilingual sraff. they could make the 
most of the n:sources they already have. 
"The clinician~ end up using thetr time 
translallng. which is a waste of their time 
when thC} should be prO\·iding therapy," 
;:-.:0\-elo explains ... It IS really overwhelming 
and frusrraong." It's a chicken-and-egg 
Jilemma: The fewer a\·ailablc bilingual 
workers, the less cffcccivc those workers 
can be. ~[cam\ htlc, monolingual parents 
are left m the dark, unable to communicate 
with Enghsh-spc..'aking workers. "It is 
care. Others are simply afraid. Trevino 
describes a similar problem with heating 
assistance. In December, federal agents 
raided the Community Action Agency, a 
local non-profit that uses federal funds 
to help poor people pay heating bills. 
The agency had assisted undocumented 
residents, who don't qualify for the 
funds, by making it easy to sign up with 
a fraudulent Social Security number. By 
deprivmg undocumented parents of heat, 
Trevino points out, the government also 
leaves young citizens in the cold. "Maybe 
the children's parents don't qualify for 
this assistance, but the child does. But the 
child can't fill out the forms! So where do 
you draw the line? Will we allow American 
children to go cold for these winter 
months?" Trevino sees it as a health care 
issue. "Imagine a house that has no heat 
the entire day, entire night-what is that 
going to do to one's health?" 

Trevino is working with legislators 
to change the heating assistance policy. 
But, for now, her story stands as one 
more example of a system that ignores 
the existence of a part of the population. 
Undocumented immigrants 
in New 
Haven number an estimated ten to twelve 
thousand people-just under teo percent 
of the city's populacion. That number 
excludes their American-born children 
and the legal immigrant residents who 
share many of tl1eir problems. 

Non-profits are hard-pressed to 
provide services to these numbers. 
Medical appointments, translators, and 
funds all come up short. Activists and 
social workers across the city repeat: 
There is not enough. But New Haven isn't 
giving up. As Trevino says, "The work 
that has co be done is endless, it seems 
at times. Bur one step at a time and we're 
going 10 me right direction. And the great 
part of it all is that you're not going alone. 
You have a whole community that's going 
w1th you." That community will allow 
nothing-nor the language barrier, not 
a discouraging scarcity of resources, not 
the retaliation of the government-to get 
in its \vay. Ir will push through nacional 
health care crises, federal raids, and cold 
\vinters. It will keep ~ew Haven fighting 
for the people who have come knocking 
at its door.
