The murders lend themsch·es to a 
morally focu~~:d n.trration, which the 
national pubhc ha~ heard repeatedly. The 
P~:tit.~ Wl'rc good people done 'Hong by 
thw unamb~uously evil ass:ulams. 

The character of du~ family was 
em bowed in its patriarch. Pent, one paper 
nnred, "never strayed far from where he 
grew up." In Plamvtllc, twdn~ miles north 
of Cheshire, his family "formed a pillar of 
civ1c hfe." He opened hts medical practice 
dO\\ n the street from the general store of 
William Perir. Sr .. and hb examirung room 
wa~ adorned not "\\ith awards, bm with 
ptctures of his fanuly." 

Petit and his wife were married 22 
years. The couple met at the Children's 
f lo~pital of Pmsburgh where he was a 
third-year medical student, she a nurse. 
Each pursued those can:ers: Petit is a 
prominent endocnnologisr, his wife was 
co-director of the health center at Cheshtre 
Acadt·my. Both were in rhe business of 
hclptng others, and their family followed 
'l;Uit. Hayley wamed to be a doctor like 
her dad and was ht:aded to Dartmouth. 
her fathcr's alma maltr, in the falL Shc 
had ratsed more than 550,000 through 
"Hayley's Hope." a team she formed to 
participate in an annual walk supporting 
research for muluple sclerosis. 

Articb describing personal details 
of the Petit's tn·es soon emerged allowing 
readers to peer into the family's private 
hfe. The public learned the instruments 
they played-Hawke-Pcur guitar and 
piano, :-.lichaela flute. The public learned 
of lhayley's co-capt:tinship of high school 
arhlcric reams. The public learned that 
.\fichaela had made balsamic \inaigrene 
for t~c .-.alad and a pa."ta sauce of "native 
tomatoes, garlic. olive oil and basil" And 
the public learned that to reft:r to the girls 
by their nicknames was ro speak of Hayes 
and KK. Rosebud. 

Reports also shed light on the tn·e~ 
of rhe criminal<. pamcularly that of 
Joshua Komisarjev,ky. Lake the Petit 
daughtc:r~. Komisar]C\ $ky gre~· up in 
Che<htre, though h1s adoptive family 
came from a line of disringutshcd Russian 
artists. Komisarie\·sk} 's great-~randfather, 
Fyodor Komisarjc\·sky. 
~-as a Russian 
op<.>.ra smger and fnend of Tchaikovskl·· 
His aum, \-era, was a notable actress. 
FebrU31) 2008 
Kormsarjevsky was adopted by a 
Chc~hire electrician who~c wife home-
schooled him and his stster. The couple 
al~o hosted foster children, one of whom 
purportedly raped Komisarjcvsky when 
ht• was fourteen. He allegedly began to 
burgle that same year. By 2002, he had 
accrued more than a do?Cn theft charge~ 
and had been sentenced ro ntne vears in 
jrul followed by six of supcf\-ised parole. 

Most accounts of the Petit murders evoked the 
town} manicured lawns and unlocked doo~ 
as if these .[Jmbols should have sustained 
secun!J rather than attracted incursion. 

The Judge who delivered the sentence 
described a "calculated, cold-blooded 
predator." 

If the Petits were poignandr '"irtuous, 
and 
Komisarjevsky 
Hayes 
archetypally cruel, the rown which housed 
them all-Cheshire-became a complex 
battleground between criminal horror 
and quotidian comfort. It is difficult to 
rc.'COncile an ace of such unimaginable 
malice ,,;th so placid a place. 

Cheshire is the" Bedding Plant Capttal 
of Connecticut.",\ rown of 29,000, it is 
nestled in the stare's ~ourhwestern regton 
or, to those who prefer more metaphoric 
coordinates, 10 irs "hc.'lll't." .\ bedroom 
community, Cheshire is a throwback to 
the era of Rotary Club meetin~. picket 
fences, and lifelong restdcnrs. Irs homes 
seemed irnpen'lous to crime. 

Residents and non-residents alike 
n:adily indulge in dus ideal portral.t of 
Che>htre. ~lost accounts of the Petit 
murders evoked the town\ manicured 
lawn$ and unlocked doors. as if the'e 
symbols should ha\·e sustained security 
rather than at:tracted tncursion. "You liw 
in a netghborhood on a tree-lined street 
for so many years," sevc:n·year "orghum 
.\liU resident Robert \wcrack tc id the 
Ntn-' )~rk Times. ''You get a false sense of 
sccunty." 

The characterization of Cheshire 
as a ha\·en at the heart of Connecticut 
deltbcrately 
overlooked 
the 
three 
correctional facilioes located at the 
to~n's northern end. The buildin~ \\"Cre 
disnusscd a:. unfortunate inrru,ions in an 
orhcf\\ise idyllic semng. .\[any indi\;duals 
who spoke to the press after the murders 
admitted that the cnme forced them to 
acknowledge their tllusion of safety, to 
realize that their dectsion w leave their 
doors unlocked could nor prevent others 
from entering them. 

The shocl.."\\'3\·c, of the cnmc 
reverberated through Connecocm. In 
a February S telephone conven;aoon, 
State Senator _\nclrew McDonald said 
that the "tragedy had scf\·cd as a clanon 
call" for Connecticut. The Petit murden; 
"displared glaring deficiencies" in the 
cnminal justice system and heightened 
the level of arrenrion paid to Connecticut 
crimes. Still, state lawmakers had not been 
entirely ignorant of such "deficiencies" 
prior to the Cheshire murders. Leg~Siauon 
enacred in July 2006 had created the 
Criminal Justice Policy and Planning 
Oi\;SIOn and tasked It With "developing 
a plan to promote a more effective and 
cohcstvc state criminal jusnce system." 

In \larch 2007. the agency prepared a 
ISS·page report titled "Comprehensive 
Plan I·or rhe Connecticut Criminal 
Jusocc ':lysrem.'" Cheshire, this document 
demon~trared, had nor been the first and 
only catalyst for crimtnal justice reform in 
Connecticut. 

Dara from the I· Bl and the L'.S. 
Dcparrmcnr of Jusoce tndtcated that the 
Petit mi.uders constituted only one part 
of a larger and lasting national trend. 
\'wlent crime in suburban communities 
wa5 up for the durd year in a CO\\. in 2006. 
Cheshire serYes as a mtcrocosm for such 
trends. Tn 2007, the town experienced 
28 burglaries. a 75 percent incrc.-ase from 
2006. 

\uthorincs 
~cued 22 bags of 
hermn. One resident shot humelf in the 
basement of hi~ home on :\'orron I..ane 
after murdering his cx·wife and her 29-
ycar-old daughter. hvc months later. 300 
Sorghum Mill \Vas invaded. 

This e\"idencc· confirms a point left 
largely untouched: The Petit murders 
\\ere one symptom of a pcn.1'1'-e tllnc,;s 
destroying Pleasantville. An account of 
the rown's earlier VIOlent encounters 
\\'aS a truth worth telling. Yer many of 
Connecticut's people replied, and the 
press preferred m overlook the~e trends, 
and concentrated on Che:.hire's clarion 
call. 

In an August 8 column in the ;\·m 
Hatrn Rtgftltr, Randall Beach wrote, "It 
feels as if thJ.S cnme ts our own '9 I 11.' The 
terrorist attacks and the Cheshire murders 
jolted us into the sudden rcalizaoon that 
our world 1s much crueler, savage and 
dangerous than we had thought, that 
we are not as safe as we had believed we 
were." He conveyed the concern of one 
woman in Wallingford, a rown adJacem to 
Cheshire, who recaUcd a conversation wirh 
a female neighbor m which they decided 
to gam about 100 pounds, let themselves 
go and forget trying to work hard for the 
nice cars. .\fter the Peot murders, this 
kind of reasoning ·was not uncommon. 

Disjomted logtc was preferable to the 
unsettling truth: Safety is never ccrtam; 
selection so often random. 

A crime as senseless as the Petit 
.fimurders demands resoluoon. People 
felt Komtsarjcvskr and Hayes should be 
severely punished, and loopholes within 
the criminal justice system should be 
closed. Connecticut GovernorM.Jodi ReU 
responded ro the outcry by suspending 
the parole of all mmates serving a 
sentence for a ";olent offense. "Secunty 
comes first," Rcll said in a September 21 
statement. "I will not aUow public safety 
to be jeopardized because parolees rcrurn 
to a life of crime. Parole IS a privilege, not 
a right." 

On November 26, a crowd of about 
75 gathered outside the 'Jew Haven 
Correctional Center on \'\'halley .\venue 
to protest the suspens1on of parole. They 
argued that the ban was a consequence of 
the cnmes commttted by Korni,at')e'·~ky 
and Haye~ unfairly unposed on mmares 
held for ,;olcm cnmes and unfairly 
affecting all mmates m the form of P.ri<on 
0\"C!Cl''\\'d.ing. 

Protes·o~ carried signs: "Books 
not bars," "Schools not Jail ," "SSS for 
education not incarceraoon." Chants of: 
"\~bat do we do when we're under attack? 
SCUld r:all, fight back"' and "\'\bar do we 
do when sooet'.' fails? Build schools, nor 
jails"' echoed m Elm Cicy streets. 

The protestors accused the state of 
valuing suburban citizens m·er urban 
ones. "\\!hat it shows us IS that a Chesh1re 
life is worth more than a '\,ew Ha' en life," 
one declared. As the evenmg progres~ed, 
the Petits were upstaged. This-the rail). 
the frustration, the hype-was not about 
Cheshire. It u-as about a "new form of 
slaYery,'' protestors a\·owed, about families 
puUed apart, about a father, mother, 
brother,gont. It was about politicians who 
"do not know what it's like on the stn:et.'' 
It was about money, ,·otes, and elections. 
It was about "standing up,'' "crymg out," 
"demanding justice,'' and "taking back 
the srrcets.'' It was about a system-a cit), 
Kew Haven-leering its citizens down. 

The responsibility for the bdown 
also shifted. The perpetracors were the 
teachers "who treated you like snot." 
They were the ministers who needeJ ro 
"wake up." They were John DeStefano, 
Kew Haven's recently re-elected mayor. 
They were the cops who beat people up. 
They were the c1ry residents not present 
at the rally. 

By the night's end, the \X'haUey 
protest had revealed a rift in the starr's 
identity, with its Bedding Plant Capital on 
one side and tts Elm Ciry on the other. 
Cheshire, protestors noted, had stood up, 
gotten mad, and defended irs own in a wa) 
that :\ew Ha,-cn. plagued \\lth systemic 
crurunal justice problerru ratht:r than 
one (hocking crime, ncRr ha~. "\\"e'rc 
nor outraged enough m '\,C\' Haven," 
concluded one u-oman. "I sh• 1.. d not be 
able to see the comer from here:' anothc·r
