J\.lauro {\[agnct ~chou! is deserted. The 
entrance ro the lm\; boxy school Is 
unimpressive: The lobby is full of fish 
tanks nnd construction-paper posters. 
But the federal~< •Vtrnmem is watching-
specifically, Carla "pmo and Z\lary Heth 
.\liklo,, two emplo1·ees whom the I•BI, in 
octwcen catchmg rerrorists and breaking 
up the mafia, has asked ro tutor kids from 
time to rime. 

lt's immediately clear that you don't 
mess with the 1'131-not even if you're 
in the third grade. Spino's first action 
upon arrwal .r tht. school was to look 
over thl "'>ruJcnr of the :'.lonth" list that 
Colcs-Cros.; pronded. One of :\hklos' 
son's fnends had occn braggmg al>out 
his Student of the \{onth status at after-
school, and ~pino wanted to make sure 
his story checked out. Luckily for hun, 
it Jtd. 

.\ccording to the J"BT website, there

emphasv:cs the preventative aspect of 
the \dopt-a-School program. The agenb 
arc meant to ~e.rve as posuiYe role models 
m the liH:~ of 'tudenrs. l\lany of the 
kids come from broken homes and ha\'e 


incarcerated parents. Agents' volunteering 
with the school gives kids the opportunity 
to see authority figures in a more positive 
light, though the agents' face-time with 
the children is fairly limited. 

The partnership with the Vinnie 
Mauro School began in late 2000. At first, 
the agents participated in one-on-one 
mentoring and tutoring of the students. 
The program fell by the wayside for a 
while after 9 I 11, when the FBI realized 
it might have more pressing issues to deal 
with than helping fourth graders with 
multiplication tables. Later, a scaled-down 
version of the project was restored. Lately, 
Coles-Cross says, "we kind of know what 
we're doing a little more," and volunteers 
from the Bureau have been able to devote 
some more time to the school. 

The Bureau's interaction with the 
school is still primarily limited to special 
holiday events and presentations. For 
instance, right before winter break, agents 
from the office come to the school to 
put on a holiday party and distribute &1ft 
bags to all the students. The upcoming 
spring project is a special presentation 
on internet safety. Coles-Cross was 
particularly concerned with exposing the 
dangers of websites like MySpace. The 
agents put on presentaoons about safety 
and the FBI itself, and generally make 
themselves available to help with any 
projects or events for which the school 
might need volunteers. 

But this subdued voluntcerism is 
the full extent of the FBI's mfiltrarion 
into New 
Haven's 
public schools. 
There appear to be no creepy plots to 
indOCtrinate the nation's youth. While it 
might at first sound like an intngumg tdea, 
there is little chance that there will be any 
"Fourth Grade FBI Agent" to follow 
"Kindergarten Cop."
