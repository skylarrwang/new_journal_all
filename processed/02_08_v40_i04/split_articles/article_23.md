~·s \rt and \rchitecturc Buildmg has bct:n loved, hated, burned, partitioned, championed as a move away from the es-

trehitectural universe and, now, may wpple its renO\ -a tor as \\·ell. 

Paul Rudolph began designing the Yale \n and Ardutecturc Building in 1958, the same year he rumed fort} and became the 
dean of the Yale School of \rchirecrurc. He'd received his degree a decade easlier from Harvard's Graduate School of Design, 
where \\"'alta Gropm$ taught hun to destgn tn the clean glass box of the lnternacional Style, then spreading across the country. 
Rudolph's first dr-J\\10~ of the A& \ showed a building just as open and squeak\· clean. 

But mw the course of five planning stages, the drawings began to show something encirely new. H uge, concrete pillars dropped 
\"crtically mro the structure. Thirry-se\cn mrerlocking levels spun out, slicing through the cavernous central space. 
"h was championed when it was first built because it was a move away from the glass box," says Yale School of Architecture 
Profes~or \kc Purves, a graduate <tudcnt in architecture at Yale while the A&A \\'llS bemg constructed. 

Rudolph's behemoth could nor be accomplished alone. He met his enabler m Charles Solomon, the cn.."am·e executive vice pres-

that a building of his "may be eighty sto-

"Whether the :\&:\ Building is in-
compkte or satisfying is for others to 
judge," Rudolph assened. Although he 
would rather have seen the structure ex-
pand southwest oYer Chapel and York 
Streets as a continuation of the pinwheel 
motion of the building's upper floors, 
Rudolph placed the service core, which 
incluJed the elevators, on the building's 
other siJe to facilitate an expansion north. 
He left clues bestdes the pinwheel and the 
service core. "If the next architect is at 
all sensttive," Rudolph said, "he will com-
plete the courtyard, thereby adding im-
measurably to the whole."
