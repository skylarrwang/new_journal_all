hough Rudolph's building was sup· 
posed to satisfy both the artists and 
the architects, he was gtven very few re-
strictions. At the inauguration of hts ,\n 
and Architecture Building in 1963, the 
architectural historian "ik')laus

product of both funcoon and art, he ar-
gued, and if it fails in one, It should be 
dismissed.

Even the architects were unhappY, though 
they were given the best spaces. Some be-
gan to erect temporary barrier.;, parritioo-
mg the open space to shield themselves 
from the constant scrutiny of their peers. 
In June of 1969, the ,\& \ caught 
fire. The Ne'"' Haven fire chief suspected 
arson. The blaze mcinerated any evtdence, 
but rumors Re\\~ Many students then and 
now believe the arson was retaliation for 
the closing of the school's cn:y-planning 
department. \lan) believe that "'ew Ha-
ven teenagers set the fire. \lanv blame 
disgruntled students, dissatisfied , .. ith 
Yale's supposed mdifferencc rowards the 
ans and convmced that the unfriendly 
1\&A embodied that sentimenr. 

After the fire, the sculptor.; packed up 
and moved out, decamping to a different 
building entirely. The painters and the ar-
chitects S\\1tchcd places, the former im-
mediately pamnonmg the founh floor to 
make studim. Screens darkened the glass 
on the extenor of the building, and the 
glass sheets themselves were subdh;ded. 
Any beauty the building p<me,scd in irs 
light, open space~ was rernO\ed. Instead 
of a light filled, if cavernous, void, the 
space inside became, as Purves recalls, "a 
dark bole." 

C
harle~ Gwathrney is 
re~roring the 
void--'.l.nd filling a hole next door. 
He has undertaken the long·awaned 
renovation of the A&\ and rhe addttion 
of a ne\\· Hi~rory of .\rt Building. The 
\&A's restoranon will adhere as closely 
to Rudolph's firushed plans as possible 
and undo yc.m of panitionang ;\nd orher 
alterations. Gwathmey studied at Yale un-
der Rudolph dunng the \& \'s inirial con· 
struction. Rolx t \.\1. Srcrn, thl' current 
dean of the \ale School of \rchitecture 
and a former classmate of G\\ .uhmey's, 
insists that Gw.\thrney "is very respect-
ful of the building." Gwathmey credits 
Rudolph as a mentor, and has continually 
stressed that he wants the addition to be 
sensitive to the \&\-to "find the real 
ethic ... and extend and enrich it." 

Unlike Rudolph, who had onlr ro 
obey himself, Gwathmey must subrrut to 
the School of \rchirecture, the History 
of \n Department, the .\rts l.Jbrary, and 
the President's office. He ha.~ ro constder 
cost, usage, building codes, ,10d other 
restrictions. The: fate of fellow architect 
Richard 
~feic:r U'UTled Gw-athmey of 
the consequences o f O\·ershooting the 
proJect's l.inuts. \Icier had planned a light, 
glassy addition that echoed the votd be· 
rween the rwo rismg verticals in the \&A 
b) placing a third to the north. The center 
atrium, though, reqwred that ilie office 
space, and the cJas,rooms, be smashed 
up agamst one sadc of the building. The 
l\leier scheme was roo tall, and, ultimately, 
too cxpensi\·e.

has destgn. \fter losing time u;th \(cier, 
rhe l ruversiry imposed a tight sched-
ule on Gwathmey. By his own account, 
G\\ at'uney desagncd the addition in three 
\\ec:ks. 

\!though Rudolph failed man} of 
the 1\&Xs user.;, perhaps because of the 
tremendous freedom he was gtven, the 
bualdang fulfilled ats educational funcnon 
under the architect's definition. He built 
rhc \&.\ ro inspare, and to \\ithstand, 
radacal shifts in optnion. The pendulum 
swangs eYen among deans of Yale's School 
of \rchitecrure, from Charles \woore, 
Rudolph's succes>or, who thought that 
the \&.\ excrnphlied where modernism 
went wrong, to ~tern, obsessed with Jts 
resroraoon. 

Rudolph didn't care if somebody liked 
his bwlding. He Je,cribed it as a ",ound-
ang board" or a ''stgnposr." ·~\tars best, it 
srirs us from our complacency," says Has-
to!') of \rt Professor Sandy Isensmdr. i\ 
student should n.'act to the .\&A. "The 
worst fare from m} \'lewpoint would be 
mdaffercncc..'' Rudolph said. 

"Dc~tgrung. \\1th Rudolph, ""3' more 
like puzzle-soh;ng," Purves says. Rudolph 
pieced together the ,\&..\ based on his 
adeas about architectural education. The 
drafttng rooms \\eTc multilevel, based on 
Rudolph's idea that the younger students 
should know what the older students were 
doing. "You looked down," he explained. 
The jury was placed right in the middle 
of the exhibition space on the second 
Boor. Purves readily admits that assuming 
the painters would oblige this philosophy 
was a big mistake. He says that the design 
may be too public even for the architects. 
"Too much like throwing people into 
the lion\ den," he hazards. Architecture 
studcms call it "the p1r." Even the walls 
assaulted. "I have a number of brwsed 
knuckles from reaching for doorways,'' 
Purves says, holding out a pair of weath· 
ered hands. 

\VJith the new HistoC) of Art Build 
W ing, Gwathmey treads a fine lme 
between respecting and challenging Ru· 
dolph's expression of power. Gwathmey 
must respond to Rudolph's building, but 
at the same time, says Stern, "You don't 
want the building to look like Sancho 
Panza tilong at a concrete windmill." 

"The History of \rt Department 
wanted to have an 1dentiry and presence. 
They didn't want to have JUSt an anony-
mous building," explams Thomas Lever-
ing, the Gwathmey Siegel associate part· 
ncr working on the project. 

School of Architecrure Professor 
Alan Planus understands Gwathmey's di· 
lemma. "It's an extremely serious building 
io the sense that it tries to relate to the 
[A&.\], yet have its own identity." 

The addition also must span the gap 
berwcen a giant, the \&\,and a Lilhpu· 
tian, the delicate, Gothtc building that 
houses the Yale D:zi/r News. ''How do 
you place a building between these ~ 
unequal neighbors?" Harries asks. In the 
models for the addition, a diagonal exte· 
rior wall juts out from the corner of the 
smaller building. The monumental new 
strucrure eats the Yale Daif> Nt111s. "The 
whole thing reminds of some sad fairy 
tale, espcciall} as the tower grou-"S taller 
and dwarfs the Bnron Hadden Memorial 
Building," says YD1\ Editor-in-Chief An-
drew I\.langino. 

he fairy tale is widclr read. If Ru· 
dolph's building unposes an atmo-
sphere of surveillance on his students, 
G\\-athmey 1s bemg watched, nor only by 
h.ts clients fr, om above, but also by a gen· 
eration of ~tudeots from belov.:
