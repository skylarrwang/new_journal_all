The book is uniCJUC among ()J,on\ 
novels because it dcliberatd} engages

Readers revel in highly educated munch

parents call their children worried stck 
Juring Sex \X'eek: they didn't think the

Con'S levels the playing field. Even your 
bnght neph=· could be a killer. 


I
f the Yalies in S01.-rtd Coils come off 
like a bunch of murJc.:rous, coke-
.tddled prostitutes, the cit)· of '-.e\\ Ha\·en 
doesn't alwars fare much bcrrer. The town 
is overrun by corrupt Ciry !I all politicians 
\\1th coteries of armed henchmen. The 
publisher of the nc\\ spaper is tm·oh-ed in 
a scam. \nrue gas thrc..-arcnmg notes, is 
mugged, held ar knife-point, and shot at. 
\. fat man named Hicke} tnes to convince 
her to JOin the escort sen ICC. \nnic notes 
how "on one block, the Gothic buildings 
of Yale to\\·cred over the street, but on 
the next, the netghborhood started gerttng 
sced1." She reminds herself not to walk 
ccrtam areas at night. 


The Elm Ctt)' surwundtng Yale ts, as 
Obon purs It in Drad OJ lht Dt!], "those 
other neighborhoods in ~ew Haven. 
where ..;hootings are JUSt a matter of 
course, routine 'for the patrol cops, a 
thrcc-mch police blotter." ~onethcless, 
just as she opposes the notion that New 
HaYen is nothing but a home for Yale, she 
won't succumb to the town's reputation 
for unchecked crime. In Sacrtd Cows, 
as Seymour walks down Chapel Street 
lookmg at the decorative bovines that give 
the novel its name (and its lead character 
an excuse to say "Fuck the Cows" as 
often as possible), she notes that "even 
though New Haven offered great theater, 
restaurants, nightlife, and shopping, there 
was still a large contingent out there in 
the suburbs who thought they'd become 
crime \,cams tf the)' crossed the city 
line." 


The characterization of New Haven 
in Olson's novels is loosely based on the 
reality of the ctty and heavily influenced 
by its mystery-novel pcdtgree. Given its 
genre, one that demands at least a little 
bit of criminal intrigue-a "whodunit" 
requires something to be dont--Olson's 
choice of serting doesn't necessarily 
demonize the Elm Cit); but she walks 
the line. If Olson is commenting on New 
Haven bv liberaong the metropolis from 
its collegtatc tenant, then the prevalence 
of crime m the novels-coupled with the 
city's recent criminal history-is another 
statement, a characterization of the sort 
that Olson seems so diligently to oppose. 


The .\ruue Sevmour senes easily exchanges 
one stereotype:. for another: ~ew Haven 
isn't only for srudent. .... There's plenty of 
room for cnrmnals. 


That ::-:ev.· Haven 1s defended for

any indication) we

or getting it on. 
depicting its crimmal underbelly is one 
of the more inmguing facets of Olson's 
series. Multi-faceted and complex, the 
Elm Cit)' is probably the best-drawn 
character m the'e books, a bi.ls that bodes 
\\'ell for the city and poorly for the novels. 


Dozens of character: are flat "types":

nothing but a ~txpack m the rcfrigeruor;
