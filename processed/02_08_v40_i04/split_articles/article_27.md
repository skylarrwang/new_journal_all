would be me? Sometimes people wam to 
hear from ,. •menne who'~ acrually been

City officials caught on to this idea. 
Ther realized that, despite Alxlussubur's 
community work. he was not the right 
person to implement the program. First 
and foremo~t, he \\".l.S a cop. ~ot only 
did he need rime to focus on his beat, 
but there was also no one the target

The best people for the job, the aldermen

"\Vhen you look around and see the 
netghborhood," says Weston, who grew 
up in New Haven, "you can't complain 
about it because you had a lot to do 
\\ith iL" He feels a responsibility to fix a 
situation he helped create. \X'eston thinks 
he's the best one co lead the street outreach 
team because, far from judging meet life, 
he understands its draws, tts highs and 
lows. "I've been in the streets since I \\".15

there's been some turnover in the staff 
due ro the challenges of the job. "There 
was a lack of suttabibry, let's leave it at 
that," she says carefully. 



The triclciest part of coordinating rhe 
program is finding the right candid:ucs 
ro run it. "This has w be more than a 
job," Weston explains. Outreach workers 
arc hired tO be there for kids. anytime, 
anywhere. If they ger a rwo a.m. phone 
call from a kid about to go shoor someone, 
it's their job to get out of bed and ralk 
the kid down. Bur m order to receive 
such a phone call, rhey need to possess a 
fl.'asons the ~cw Havcn Family .Alliance 
u-on the contract for the program was 
its pre-cxtsting resource network. If an 
outreach worker discovers that one of 
their ktds is failing school or expecting 
a child. he or she can hook the kid up 
"ith the Family Alliance's adult ruronng 
or parenting programs. rhe workers also 
refer rheir charges to outstde addicoon 
and counseling resources. 1\lany of the

Rather than letting gang

cause a reverse domino effect: as fewer

Perc steps on the gas. George bangs on 
the door and Perc brakes so that George 
can ro~~ out his cigarette and climb in. 
"That's why you the new gur," George 
laughs. 
lr\ Pete's second week on the job .• -\ 
'' inged ranoo on his neck peeks out of 
ht' purple Jacket, whtch he wears proudly. 
\ rnlilish beard frames his face and a gray 
knit lwlft coYers his !'kull. So far, Perc's 
only ridden uith Doug~c, Ius mentor, 
around DL'I.·well, bur tonight he and Blest, 
who t' tn hts third week, arc setting our on 
their U\\ n. \fter !hey drop George in the 
f ltll. thq slow down and begm to look 
around. Blest sees a group of kids with 
trick btkes hanging on the sidewalk, and 
he tells Pete to srop. The two get out and 
amble 0\·cr to the kids, who back awa}: 
Fh e minutes later, Pete and Blest are back 
in the car. 'Ther kno\\' me more outside 
this jacket," says Blest. 
He's familiar with many of New 
Ha\'en's young people through a program 
called Cnicing Our Youth, which he's 
opc.--rared for a few } <.-ars now, but Blest 
1~ still adjusting ro ltfc in rhe purple 
jacket. These kids don't recognize his neu 
uniform ret He and Perc talk constantly 
about Dougie, who's a more established 
prt~<.ncc ill the neighborhoods. They 
dme over to Di:rndl to meet up uith 
him but he has the rught off, so Pete pulli 
mto one of Dougie's usual haunts, a strip 



kids on crick bikes, one of whom is 
Dougte's son. "You play ball, man, what 
you illto?" Blest asks one of them. He 
gets a mumbled response. \ police car 
flashes past, blaring ItS Steen, and me lads 
lose mterest. They pedal languidly away. 
Blest moves on to two girls leaning on 
the \\'all outside Cluna ~mr He introduces 
himself to Wynisha, who's rwenty and ill 
school to be a parole officer, and Sandy, 
who's 17 and pregnant. "You read) to 
raise a child?'' Blest asks ::.andy. She stuffs 
her hands into her parka pockets and 
looks down, a faint smile stuck on her 
face. ,\ young bor ambles over and pms 
his head on her shoulder. 
"Is this your gtrl?" Blest asks the 
boy, who laughs and \\'alks a\\-ay. Sandy's 
boyfriend is out dealtng, Bbr eventually 
pulls out of her. "\favbe you guys'll get 
married," he says, "bur he needs to be 
productive, pay child suppon. If you plan 
on marrymg this man you guys gona be 
r<..-ady for it, cuz it's a big step." 
Sandy smiles, silentl). 
Before he and Pete climb mro the '\'an, 
Blest tells Sandy, .. That's what it really is. 
you don't give yourself a chance." In the 
car, he says that he never knew his own 
father and had his firsr child ar 17. Pete, 
who also never knew his father, has a 
three-month-old son. He showed pictures 
10 Sandy and \V~·nisha on hts cell phone. 
"I get touched, like, ever since I've 
~d 
my life around," Pete says as he 
dnves over to the Ville 
ewhallville-
which he and Blest agree ts the roughest 
part of town. They don't stop; it's not 
safe for a reporter. Perc grew up in the 
Bronx but has lived in New Haven for 19 
years, he says. He dealt and used heroin 
and crack until five years ago, when he 
ha bottom. He still ancnds :-;arcocics 
\nonymous mecongs sometimes, and 
hL relics hea,-iJy on h1s faith; he's been a 
\(uslim for three years. 
Pete and Blest recall how when they 
were teenagers, street fighting was fist to 
fisr '\.low, \\ith the pre\·alence of guns, 
rhmg:; ha,·e changed. "It's a survival 
L1cuc," Pete sap. "I'm gonna blow your 
brains our before you blow mine. I may 
stt m J<Ul, bur noboJr \\-ants ro go inro the 
ground." 
\s street outreach workers, the two 
\\am ro teach kids different ways to 
sun·we. The conver~ation cycles back 
to 
Doug~e, who recently prevented a 
shooting. One of Dougie's kids got 
jumped the other mght, says Blest, but his 
friends went ro Dougie's house in Dixwell 
before anyone called rhe police. Dougie 
talked to the perpetrator and the victim's 
friends, and he diffused the situation so 
that the police never knew about it. That, 
Blest and Perc say, b the kind of street 
outreach worker rhc) want to be. 
"l want to have my k1ds engulfed in 
me," Blest says. "I'm engulfed in my kids, 
bur I want my kids to be engulfed in me 
like Dougie's are in him." 
Time will cell if a purple jacket, 
criminal background, and crusader's 
energy will win Blest k1ds' trust. Even if 
I hey do, me future of New Haven's street 
outreach worker program will remain 
tenuous. founding 1s ~ecurcd through July, 
but after that, Tmney and \X'eston will
