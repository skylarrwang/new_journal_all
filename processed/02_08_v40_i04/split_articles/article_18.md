EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Four years ago, a newly-arrived immigrant miscarried in the bathroom stall of St. Raphael's emergency room. "I came—a big piece of meat with blood—and I was so scared," she recalls. "And I said, 'You know what, I think I'm losing my baby right now.'" She spoke little English. Uninsured, she had been made to wait, pregnant and bleeding, for several hours at a New Haven clinic, then for another hour at St. Raphael's. "Just take Motrin," she remembers the doctors saying as they sent her home after the miscarriage. "I said, 'Should I come back?' and they said, 'Do you have insurance?' 'No.' And they said, 'Oh, no, don't come back. If you come back, you need an appointment and some insurance.'"

She would have three more miscarriages before undergoing surgery to remove uterine scar tissue. The procedure restored her fertility but left her with an unexpected five-thousand dollar debt. Though she had, by that time, heard about and qualified for free care at Yale-New Haven Hospital, her surgery was taken over without her knowledge by the Yale Medical Group, private practitioners at Yale-New Haven who do not participate in the free care program.

On a recent afternoon at Book Trader Cafe, she pulls out a picture of her daughter, now ten months old. "Now I am aware, and when I had my baby I used to go to them and said, 'Oh no no! What are you going to do?'"
