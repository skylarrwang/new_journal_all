Kings of the Hill 
Mo~T Frun w .\FTERJ...;oo:-;s .n C. \SA LmK\, 
a small community center in New Raven's 
Hill neighborhood, about nine teenagers 
sip Capri Sun, eat Rice Krispies Treats, and 
discuss ways to fix their neighborhood. 

Students toss their coats and backpacks 
m a corner and chat quietly in the Casa's 
basement until thetr organizer, an older 
woman named Frances Vazquez, arrives 
ro help the Hill Youth Action Team 
(HYXI) develop and carry out tts cures 
for the Hill's degradation. 

The team, created by the Hill 
Neighborhood Forum m conjunction with 
community groups Youth@Work and 
The Consultation Center, began as a six-
week leadership program in the summer 
of 2006. Like the Board of Young Adult 
Police Commissioners or New Raven's 
penodic "teen only" hearings, HYAT 
proVJdes an opportunity for young adults 
ro identify and solve problems in their 
community. It is committed to finding 
youth-based solutions and avoiding adult 
intervention whenever possible. Lindsey 
Redd, a junior at Career High School and 
one of the original members of HY:\T, 
takes that role seriously. "I want people to 
look back and say we did something," he 
says. "I want them tO say we improved the 
neighborhood." 

\'\'ith this goal in mind, HY AT hopes 
to eventually tackle loommg problems like 
teen pregnancy and gang violence. But 
for now, the group focuses on smaller-
scale proJects: taking an inventOf)' of 
abandoned houses in their neighborhood, 
organizing a cleanup of Minor Street, 
and cr.:ating a colorful banner remmding 
residents to "Keep The Hill Clean." 

The students' commitmem to action 
is evident even in the structure of their 
meetings. They open their folders and 
split in to various comminees: fundraising, 
community service, public relations, field 
trip organization, event orgaruzation, and 
design . â€¢ \s student Nicole Smith explains, 
"\X'e each serve on two comminees so that 
our jobs each week are set and everyone 
can be held accountable." She sounds 
more like the manager of a company 
than a high school junior in a sweatshirt 
and Jeans. Her professionalism is widely 
shared. 

Despite their adult work ethic, HYAT 
members exude a youthful1dealism. "The 
little steps art noticed," says Redd. He, 
like man} of his cohorts, emphasizes the 
aesthetics of the neighborhood, claiming 
they "make people act the way they 
act." Indeed, when the team ranked the 
problems plagumg their neighborhood 
last _\ugust, litter won out over cnme and 
violence. Shamonay Pittman, a high school 
freshman and "the baby of the group;' 
explains the self-perpetuating cycle. "If 
the streets aren't clean, people don't think 
that one more piece of trash matters, so 
they don't pick it up. But," she continues, 
"it's hard to walk b} when there is only 
one piece of trash on a clean street." It's 
an apt summary of the "broken windows" 
theory which "Jew York City employed ro 
fight its own problems with crime in the 
1990s. The teens often use this theory to 
express a larger hope: that their projects 
~ill make people proud to live in the Hill. 

The teens qualify this pride, tt:)"ing to 
differentiate it from that of gangs. ''We're 
sticking up for our turf in a different way, 
a non-violent way," explains Smith. 

For most, involvement with HYAT 
began as a summer job. Redd applied for a 
job through Youth@\X'otk, a New Haven 
partnership that provides employment 
opportunities for students ages 14 to 19. 
"They JUSt pur you places," he says. ''1 
JUSt ended up here." Several students cite 
similar experiences. 

Despite their coincidental beginnings 
\\--ith HYAT, many students feel invested
