'What's up, fellas?' Miss Shirley asks, sauntering around the classroom in a gray skirt suit, knee highs, and red hoops. 'Everybody go to school today?' 
The eight boys and three girls, slouched in their hoodies and windbreakers, look between 14 and 18 years old. They say nothing. 
Miss Shirley reaches this life skills class four days a week, but she never knows who will show up. Many kids are court-ordered to attend, some are brought in by fed-up parents or grandparents, and still others are recruited by the New Haven Family Alliance, a non-profit organization that organizes the class. Today's session began late, at 4:30 instead of 4:00, and people continue to trickle in. Before long, there are 15 boys and six girls. Miss Shirley has scrawled 'Transferrable Skills' [sic] on a big sheet of paper. She asks the class for a definition. 
George, who has just sauntered in, raises his hand. He's wearing stonewashed jeans, spotless yellow and blue sneakers, and a North Face jacket. 'It's when you take something from life, from school, and apply it to something like a job,' he tells Miss Shirley. 'Say you count money real good selling drugs, then you can count money real good somewhere else.' 
Miss Shirley had planned an exercise in which the kids would brainstorm what skills a housewife could market if her husband got injured, but she changes her tack. 'Everybody know what the definition of a drug dealer is, right?' she asks. They laugh. She asks them to shout out a drug dealer's transferable skills. 
'They can save money.' 
'They're a chemist.' 
'They can cook, too!' 
'They can measure.' 
'They can bag up, chop, break down,' the kids say. 'They can talk, they can sell, they can run.' Miss Shirley scribbles skills on the paper, and the group decides that a drug dealer could get a job as a car salesman, a carpenter, an inventor, or a scientist. 
'If I'm a drug dealer, can I be a cop?' Miss Shirley asks. 
'Sure you can,' says a boy called Bobo. 'Look at 'em right now.' He's referring to Billy White, a New Haven narcotics cop arrested last spring for on-duty theft and bribery. His scandal prompted an FBI probe into the narcotics department, which produced two more arrests. 
A man by the door chimes in. 'If you're a cop you could be the one to change how people are being treated, you could turn around what's going wrong,' he says. He's older than the kids, around forty, and his long braids are covered with a knit cap. He has a diamond hoop in one ear and a diamond stud in the other. His name is Blest Peters, but the kids know him as Blest. 


Blest has reformed himself since he dealt cocaine in the '80s. Today, he is part of New Haven's Street Outreach Team, which was launched last July. At night, he dons a bright purple jacket with 'NEW HAVEN STREET TEAM' stamped on the back, drives around the city in a minivan, and talks to kids. He works for the New Haven Family Alliance and is paid by private organizations and the state. He receives information from the police but gives none in return. 


New Haven residents, who have witnessed the unfolding of a police corruption scandal during one of the worst spikes in violent shootings the city has seen since the notorious early '90s, are looking beyond traditional policing to protect their homes and families. For many, the most troubling fact is how much of the violence is committed by teenagers, and they are hoping that former Chief Ortiz's resignation caps a 60 percent spike in firearm-related homicides from 2005 to 2006. 


criminals like Blest and the seven other street outreach workers will help check escalating youth gun violence by showing kids how they got off the streets and why it's worth the effort. 
When a girl says that she gave back to the community when she was selling drugs by buying book bags for all the kids on her block, Blest breaks in. 'If drugs gave back to the community, the community wouldn't be in the state it's in.' Blest speaks with the authority of experience. 'Book bags are good, but if kids are on the streets not going to school, then those book bags are empty, there's no knowledge in them.' Blest likes to speak in aphorisms. 
'Some of us drug dealers have morals,' protests George, who is living in a group home and trying to straighten out. While he was selling crack, he sold to a woman he didn't realize was his friend's mom until he knocked on her door to deliver a baggie. His friend answered. 'I felt that was wrong cuz it was my homeboy's mother,' he says. He stopped selling to her. 


By now, kids fill every chair in the room, and they're talking over each other, trying to squeeze in stories of fathers who left them, cousins who betrayed them, and babies they don't want to grow up like them. 
A booming voice cuts through the buzz. A short woman in a skintight, pale blue sweatshirt with half-moon sweat stains stands on her tiptoes and waves her arms. 'Everybody knows it's wrong,' says Monique 'Mo' Cooper, another street outreach worker. 'It's just our way of surviving. Somebody passed it on to us. It's a selfish game out there in the street.' 
'Nobody wants to sell crack to someone's mother,' Mo says, 'but sometimes it's just what you gotta do.' 
But she doesn't push any more. She broke the cycle. And that, presumably, is what they're all here for. 
A boy named Milton says he, too, is trying to break the cycle, but his friends won't let him. They don't want him to stop selling or get off the streets, and he knows they'll come after him if he does. 
Miss Shirley advises Milton to run, to do what it takes to get out of the game, but Milton shrugs. No way he'll run. 
Other kids agree, talking over each other again, until street outreach worker Anthony 'Ant' Ward pulls up his sweater and shouts, 'I wish I ran! I wish I ran!' 
All eyes in the room are fixed on a foot-long, inch-deep, jagged scar running through Ant's belly fat. 'I was stupid, I was stupid, I was so stupid,' Ant says into


Despite the city's overall declining crime rates, New Haven kids are shooting each other more and more often. In the summer of 2006, the city was shocked by the deaths of Jajuana Cole and Justus Suggs, both 13-year-olds who stayed out of trouble but got in the way of angry kids with guns. Cole and Suggs were part of the 90 percent of New Haven youth who, according to downtown alderwoman Bitsy Clark, are far from troublemakers but still at risk. 
Clark is chair of the aldermanic Youth Services Committee. In the midst of a recent citywide debate over whether to institute a youth curfew, she heard again and again from the police that, as she puts it, 'there were a corps of kids in the city that were causing the problems, that were at the core of the issues.' So she and Community Services Administrator Kica Matos did some research. The pair concluded that only 3 percent of the city's youth were involved in criminal activity, and 1 percent were at risk of heading in that direction. 
When Clark and Matos examined New Haven's youth programs—its after-school activities, summer camps, and mentoring partnerships—they realized that all of them were directed at the well-behaved 90 percent. The troublemakers, it seemed, were left to the police. 
Matos and Clark began to research programs aimed at the at-risk youth population in other cities. They soon learned about Providence's Institute for the Study and Practice of Nonviolence, which garnered national publicity for hiring ex-junkies as street workers. These social workers with unconventional pasts head to the hospital after a shooting, hook kids up with educational and occupational resources, and act as father figures to many who are already fathers themselves. 
Many consider this strategy an ideal form of community policing, a concept which has been around for decades but was spotlighted by President Bill Clinton's Community-Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program. Included in the 1994 Crime Bill, COPS promised to put a hundred thousand new cops on the street so that cities could continue to fund walking old-fashioned beats. The idea was that if the police established a constant neighborhood presence and got to know the people they were policing, the new officers would pay for themselves in the crimes they prevented. Though COPS finished twenty thousand officers short of its goal, it contributed to the 33 percent drop in the national violent crime rate during Clinton's eight years in office. 
'I am a strong proponent, an ardent proponent of community policing,' outgoing New Haven Police Chief Francisco Ortiz asserts. 'I think it's a way of life for policing in New Haven. It is institutionalized here in our department from top to bottom, to our community, and officers would have it no other way.' New Haven embraced community policing in 1990, under Chief Nicholas Pastore. Since doing so, the city's crime rate has dropped 56 percent. COPS funding helped nurture this approach. Despite a series of Bush administration budget cuts that have severely reduced federal funding of local policing, Ortiz, who became chief in 2003 after working his way up through the department, has remained vocally committed to the practice of community policing. 
An external panel called in to review the police department in the midst of the narcotics probe, however, has observed a recent decline in New Haven's community policing practices. And in November, Ortiz announced his resignation. He will stay on until the city completes a national search for a new chief to rebuild the
