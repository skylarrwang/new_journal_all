Even in the middle of labor, she had to 
fight for her own care.

The government, maybe, b01 before 
policies can change, ,\mencans must 
resoh'e the debate o\'Cr who can and 
cannot claim government scrvtces. One 
thing is ccnam: If health care is a human 
nght. as many argue, then the lack of 
health sen;ces is a crime. 

"The other thing that is rea.llr stressful 
is medicme, because you don't have a 
special rate for that. Jr is really hard, 
really expensive." She knows people who 
buy medicine from their home countries 
or make nacural cures themselves. The 
exr.remelr sick often go back to their own 
naoons when they cannot find r.rear.rnenc 
here. The government should do more, 
she insists. But when asked what, she 
pauses. "It's hard for me to even think 
about it because of my legal situation. It's 
like you don't even exist here." 

\X'ith no cenr.ral source of health 
care information, immigrants learn to 
navigate the strange byways of 
an opaque health care '}'tt.:m. Legal 
restdents who work mimmum \l."agC jobs 
and arc not the guarduns of children 
often don't qualify for healrh insurance. 
Undocumented residents arc not only 
derued benefits but arc also often too 
terrified to ask healthcarc professionals 
for help. "All the rime you arc afraid," 
one immigrant explains. "You arc aslcing 
yourself, oh, when are they going to ask 
me for my Social Secunty?" 

The few clinics in Ne" Haven that 
accept the uninsured--<.:tther offering 
free care or charging a special fee-rarely 
offer translation services. Even those that 
do often take up ro two hours to get an 
interpreter on the phone. Emergency 
room care is limited, says Kelly Hebrank, 
a New Haven social worker. "People 
come m and say, "lou kno\1.~ I need this 
tooth pulled, it's causmg me a lot of pain.' 
And I say, 'You kno\\', )OU can go to an 
emergency clinic but only if )Our face 
is swollen. They'll only sec you if your 
face is swollen-they don't care if you're 
in pain!"' 

"\X'e don't ha~·e access to a specialist,"

commumicating through a 
r.rarulator. 

The woman pur:; away her daughter's 
piccure and grows serious. "Why, in a 
first class counr.ry. the human beings 
are treated as merchandise?... How is 
that possible?"  An activist with a planner and cell phone on 
the table in front of her, she speaks with 
conviction. "\'\'e are forgetting that we are

decentralized and chaotic U.S. health care 
system: a patchwork of hospital programs, 
public school social servtces, and intricate 
government regulations, held together by 
an array of fund-strapped, overu.'Orked 
non-profits. 

For these U.S. residents, there is no 
health care system. 

B
ut there is a New Haven community 
that has chosen to take up the battle. 
Ftghong against insufficient care is the 
collecovc force that connects i.mnugtants

can help them. It is a community in which 
restdents show fierce pad e. "We're united," 
says Sandra Trevino, the execuove director 
of the Latina-interests organization Junta 
for Progressn-e Action. "I think that's one 
of the reasons why a lot of people are 
attracted to New Haven ... \Ve welcome 
our residents." The solidarity of groups 
like Junta accompanies the intimate
