depends on not the volts but the joules. 

Kehoe insists that tasers have no ad,·erse 
effect on coronary function. "It takes 
three tO four hundred joules of energy 
to stop a heart. The taser delivers .21 
joules," Kehoe says. "Even if someone 
has a pacemaker, it v.·ould see the taser as 
electrical interference, that's it." 

After a shooting, a police supen'isor 
downloads 
the 
footage 
from 
taser's camera and records it to DVD. 
According to Rob Smuts, the city's Chief 
Administrative Officer, New Haven police 
officers have used tasers eight rimes since 
the program began last summer. The 
most recent incident involved a domestic 
l/ choc insists that the electrical output 
~rom tasers has never direcdy caused 
a death. "Tasers are generally safe. Ninety-
nine percent of the injuries related to taser 
usc arc minor ones that come from falling 
tO d1c ground." \\'bile organizations such 
as \mncsry International attribute over 
1:\\'0 hundred deaths tO taser use, Kehoe 
adrnirs to only 1:\venty cases where tasers 
were e\·en a conuibuting cause of death. 
In each of these incidents, the shock was 
compounded by drugs or preexisting heart 
problems. He Bady denies the possibility 
that the electric shock alone can kill a 
man. ln \\'atcrbury, he recounts, a naked 
man was found pitchforking his own car

dispute in wluch the husband sprinted 
for a pistol in the bedroom, only to be 
stunned by a raser before he could reach 
the gun. "But for the taser, the man or 
the officers could have been shot fatally," 
Smuts says. "This 'vas a te>.:tbook example 
of how tascrs can step in to saw lives." 

S
ince 1999, Kehoe tells me, there have 
been over a million discharges of the 
Taser X26 nationv.:ide, including staged 
incidents during officer traming sessions. 
Kehoe has tasered over 4,500 people in 
the field and during demonstrations. He 
has been tascred 27 omcs himself. 1 ask 
him what it feels like to be immobilized 
by a bolt of electricity for five seconds. 
"Have you eYer hit your funny bone? 
Magnify that feeling o,·er your entire 
body. It's definirdr uncomfortable, bur 
when it's done, it's done," he replies. He 
makes it sound almost ordlnarr-
"This device changes the way officers 
do their job," Kehoe clauns. He relates an 
incident: A few years ago he was searching 
a house suspected of containing large 
quannties of illegal drugs. \Vhcn he gor 
there with the search ,.,-arrant, he ;tnd his 
fello\\ officers were O\'Crwhelmed by a 
snarling black dog. Though they would 
have shot the dog in the past, this time 
they were able to tascr him. "Fifteen 
minutes later," Kehoe tells me \\ith a 
smile, "1 was petting the guy." 

b) tht side of the highwa} last year. The 
man ran through 1:\\'0 plate-glass windows 
before police were able to chase down 
and tascr him. "This guy dies two or drree 
hours later, and of course the headlines 
rcaJ 'TasereJ .Man D1es' the next day. But 
you know what? The autopsy found a 
lcrh:tl dose of cocaine in Ius blood. Tha£'s 
what did it," he says. 

Regardless of Kehoe's reassurances, 
public concerns cononuc w swarm around 
rasers. \mncst) International would like 
to see more independent tcsnng, and 
has compiled a !Jst of cases in which 
Citizens h;wc been rased inappropriately.

In 2005, a Colorado man was tased twice 
after allegedly stealing lettuce from a 
Chuck F. Cheese salad bar. But it's the 
sene~ of recent cvems at \mcrican 
umn:rsities rhat has shocked people inro 
reconsidering raser usc. \t CCLA, a

\ndrcw ~[C) cr was rased after hoggmg

His protests became condensed m the 
popular catchphrase. "Don't taSe me, 
bro!" 

Student 
demonstrations 
held 
afterward declared that the police had 
used excessive force. Coupled with 
Amnesty's complaints, incidents of this 
kind suggest that police can be too hasty 
in pulling out their new weapons. 

Even in situations involving real 
crimes, police might not have the training 
to use rasers effectively. Though Smuts 
and Kehoe attest to the excellence of 
New Haven's taser program, the verdict 
outside city government remains unclear. 
Just four days after the pilot program was 
approved, police bungled the first incident 
involving rasers in the Elm City. After a 
suspect was tased for punching a police 
officer, the firefighters at the scene didn't 
know bow to remove the probes from his 
skin and had to take him to the hospital. 
Then, when no one could download the 
video evidence from the taser camera, an 
off-duty supervisor had to be summoned 
at three in the morning. 

Despite the controversy, business is 
srill good at Taser International. They're 
the only manufacturer of the taser gun, 
not to be confused with the outmoded 
stun gun that induces pain instead of 
delivering the raser's patented "electrical 
muscular interference." "Our company 
name has become its own verb," Kehoe 
proudly exclauns. 'We're like Kleenex or 
Xerox!" The company has been sued 64 
times, but so far, aU of the lawsuits have 
been dismissed. 

To prove the safety of his company's 
product, Kehoe offers to taser me so I 
can feel what it's like to be temporarily 
incapacitated. "It doesn't even have to 
touch your skin!" he promises. ''I can just 
stick the probes onto your clothing." I tell 
him I have a low pain tolerance and gendy 
turn down his offer. Kehoe says that he 
won't hold it against me. Instead, he pulls 
out a tiny silver pin from his briefcase 
and places it into my palm as a parting 
gift. The pin is a model of the Taser X26, 
reduced to one-renth of its original size. I 
put it inco my pocket for safekeeping. I'm 
sure I'll never wear the pin, but I thank 
him nonetheless. This way, no one gets 
hurt.
