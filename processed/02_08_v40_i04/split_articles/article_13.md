A Bite out of Crime 
0\"I.R nu t~\ST snEs \IO...,JHS, GE."lERAL 
Manager ]afar \hmed has hired nearly one 
hundred people to fiU the nine delivery 
pos1rions at his Domino's franchise at 
the corner of \X inthrop and Whalley. He 
crcles through so many new hires because 
delivering food in New Haven is a risk-y 
business. On average, one of Ahmed's 
dcliverymen is mugged each month. 

J\t those odds, and with a wage barely

14 dtffcrent businesses were mugged 
between October 4 and December 1 
of lasr year. In the last two weeks of 
January. police reported the mugging of 
three more.

call, a delivery person will head out, and, 
when he.: arm·es, a double-crossing caller

rhc goods arc handed over. Somecimes 
muggers wane money, but usually irs just 
for the food. 

Recounted 
in 
newspapers 
follo\"\ing dar. these incidentS often read 
like something out of a "\\~odd's Worst" 
crime ~pccial. A culprit's usual take is the 
vc:ncable treasure crove of four dollars and 
a slice of pizza-most muggers work in 
groups and most deliverymen only carry
