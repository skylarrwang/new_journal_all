classes to reach skills from "how to talk 
to doctors" to "how to read medical 
labels." For the most part, immigrants 
say, they rely on friends and neighbors to 
advise them and to lead them to the best, 
safest places to find care.


On a recent Saturday morning, the 
streets of Fair Haven are silent except 
for the whip of winter wind. But visitors 
to HAVEN Free Clinic are greeted with 
a huge smile and a booming, "Buenos 
dias! English or Spanish?" Students from 
the Yale School of Medicine, Public 
Health, and Nursing, along with advising 
physicians and a few undergraduates, have 
run the weekly clinic since 2004. Because 
HAVEN offers both medical and social 
services, volunteers know their patients' 
biographies, from their boyfriends and 
grandchildren to their jobs and their bills. 
Barbara Hirshman 
'11, '13, a 
bubbly medical student with shining blond 
hair, looks through patients' charts and 
squeals with excitement. "We have such 
great patients coming through today!" She 
holds up a bulging folder. "Ooh, L.R.! 
Another one of our epic patients. Last 
week he brought in 15 bills." Hirshman's 
team of social service volunteers works 
to make those bills disappear. While the 
clinic itself offers only basic care, the 
volunteers negotiate with doctors and 
hospitals to secure their patients' access to 
the same expensive tests and procedures 
that insured people 
receive.  Brima 
Barber 'MED '10, an associate director 
of HAVEN, sees the work as a lesson for 
medical students used to a "well-funded 
hospital and well-insured patients." "If 
we weren't there, they wouldn't get a lot 
of these tests. These are things that are 
pretty readily available four days a week in 
the hospital, and you just go a few blocks 
away and they're not." HAVEN also copes 
with limited translation services. Today, 
the clinic expects thirty or forty patients, 
and one of two interpreters has canceled 
at the last minute. A nurse bursts into 
the lobby and demands of a volunteer, 
"Do you know Spanish? How do you say 
colonoscopy?" The girl hesitates. "Um... I 
don't know... colonoscopia?"


HAVEN teaches patients to take 
advantage of soup kitchens, public school 
systems, and community organizations like 
Lunta. The more experienced volunteers 
also serve as unofficial authorities on 
health care systems, especially the maze 
of regulations that limit access to free 
care. Yale Haven is one of the few 
providers of free care in New Haven. 
"St. Rapheal's, 
they cut the bill in half, 
but it's still not enough," Hirshman says. 
At Yale-New Haven, where the 
HAVEN group has allies, problems with 
unannounced Yale Medical Group charges 
are frequent.


Applying for free care 
requires expert maneuvering. To receive 
free care, patients must have proof that 
they do not qualify for State Administered 
General Assistance, which stipulates that 
its beneficiaries have a social security 
number. Free-care hopefuls must apply to 
SAG, receive a letter of rejection, and 
use that letter to qualify for complimentary 
care. But free care programs accept only 
one specific reason for rejection. When 
HAVEN volunteers help a patient apply 
to SAG, they include a letter asking for 
the technical category of rejection that 
serves as a ticket for free care. "We have 
had 100 percent success getting rejection," 
Hirshman says without irony.


This commitment to patient advocacy 
has given HAVEN a local reputation 
among immigrantsâ€”even those 
who 
lack 
documentation. 
HAVEN 
workers know to broach the subject 
delicately with patients. Often people 
give fraudulent Social Security numbers. 
Hirshman smiles. "I just ask, 'Did you 
get this 
social security number from 
a friend, or a cousin?'"
