EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
A squadron of Orthodox Jews gathers nightly on the steps of the imposing stone yeshiva in New Haven's Edgewood neighborhood. Each wears a black t-shirt with "Edgewood Park Defense Patrol" written in script on the back, and, until November, some carried concealed, licensed weapons. They break into pairs, and head out for a night of pounding and protecting the streets. In warmer weather, they waved to residents sitting on the porches of the neighborhood's decaying Victorian homes. They are self-appointed watchmen on the lookout for trouble, shuffling along groups of loitering boys or stopping wheeling drunks from getting in their cars.

But mostly they just walk, and walking has never received so much media attention or caused such a stir. The hubbub centers on the guns and the Greers, the prominent and outspoken Orthodox Jewish family that founded the patrol last June. The family's patriarch, Rabbi Daruel Greer, has spent much of his adult life in the Edgewood neighborhood. His two sons, Dov and Eliezer, both in their thirties, live there as well. Dov, the elder, is a rabbi with a wry smile that often peeks through his beard. He teaches and leads services at the yeshiva his father started. Eliezer, the more brazenly outspoken, runs the Greers' property management company, renovating and renting out nearby houses.


As the media speculated on what would happen if an Orthodox Jew shot a black man in the inner city, the Greers insisted again and again that their patrol has nothing to do with religion. "A lot of us walk around here—forget Shabbos—it's race to walk," Dov says.

It is nice to walk. But Orthodox Judaism cannot help but shape the Greers' relationship to their home—and to walking. In our pick-up-and-move society, the Greers have an almost unparalleled stake in their neighborhood. They can't escape the reality of the inner city; "white flight" is not an option for the Orthodox Jewish community. One day a week, every week, every year, the Greers must walk everywhere. The sprawling suburbs, home to many Conservative Jews, does not accommodate that need. And when crime threatened this prerogative, the Greers, instead of recreating from their February 2008 homes, imposed on themselves a mandate to walk the streets every night.


Yet Dov's insistence that this is about more than the Orthodox community is true as well. The denomination, which has long insisted on the good behavior of its adherents, can no longer go it alone. The Greers don't just want the members of their congregation to behave. They need everyone to.


In June, walking home in the warmth of a summer afternoon, Dov noticed three kids traipsing a few yards behind him. Two doors away from home, he broke into a run. The boys sprinted after, pushed their way inside, and started wailing punches on Dov in the foyer of his house. He started tearing right back into the boys, shouting to his wife to call 911. The Greers could not flee and so they decided to fight back. Two days after the attack, Daruel, Dov, and Eliezer held a press conference in a yeshiva classroom to announce the founding of the Edgewood Park Defense Patrol.


The methods of these modern-day Maccabees have caused more controversy and confusion than their pronouncements. Although the Greers insisted that members of the EPDP would carry guns—defying strong pressure from City Hall to put them down—it soon became clear that, despite the sensationalism, no one in the EPDP was likely to fire one. The activity of the patrol, at any given moment, is tame and somewhat absurd. The EPDP does not make citizens' arrests—they call the police. They spend most of their time politely asking groups to move along.


The EPDP is fundamentally a ritual display. The guns were a theatrical measure, not a practical tool. The appearance of the EPDP on the streets mattered as much as, if not more than, the work they did there. The EPDP has given the Greers a public platform from which to rail against the failures of City Hall and the police department. Eliezer has seized it. He holds numerous EPDP press conferences outside the neighborhood police substation. "The press conferences, with Channel 8 and Fox News—it's like cats coming out for the cook's scraps," he says. Last May, in his typical rhetorical style, Eliezer shouted, "Blood is being spilled on the backs of incompetence!"


This theatricality has a purpose. The Greers' use of spectacle in their quest to restore a sense of security is a tactic they share with the police. Though perpetually at odds, both groups have a lifetime investment in New Haven, and both have learned to use the visual to revive a concept teetering on the edge of becoming a vestige: "community."


Efforts to preserve the community began with little more than construction paper and a copy machine. In the early '90s, as prostitutes roamed the streets, Daruel Greer printed out multicolored flyers and posted them across his neighborhood. Suddenly, the mugs of suburban middle-aged men recently convicted of soliciting prostitution in Edgewood stared out from every telephone pole. Below the photos were the offenders' names, and above was the title, "JOHN-OF-THE-WEEK." The number of out-of-town men trolling for sex immediately plummeted, as did the drug sales and violence that thrived alongside the industry. "He also got the law changed, so that anybody who was convicted had his car impounded, too," Dov boasts of his father's inspired Saul Letter maneuver. "Then he'd have to explain to his wife in the suburbs what happened to his car." The John-of-the-Week program's success has reached the level of city lore, and Eliezer and Dov have internalized its lesson.


When crime rises in a neighborhood, it poses an implicit question: Are there people here who are willing to stand up and say, "We are the community, and we will say—and enforce—what we regard as acceptable behavior?" Daruel Greer, with the ingenuity of public theater, forced the question to a head. The answer was yes.


The police also fought the rampant crime of the early nineties with an ingenuity that worked its way into city lore. In 1990, New Haven adopted "community-based policing," permanently transforming its theories concerning public safety. Janet Lander, Mayor John DeStefano's first chief administrative officer, describes the shift. "In modern happenings, police respond, arrests are made," she says, describing the "before" picture. Under the new program, by contrast, "you get to know the community, you know the people in it."
