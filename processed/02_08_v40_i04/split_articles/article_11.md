POINTS Of_ DEPARTURE 
Art on Architecture 
"S.\M," ,\ PSEUDOSY~Iot ~ Y \I I S'l1 D1 .._ r 
majoring in art, couiJ !>kip the l.ou\'rc: 
on his next trip to Pans. I k'd rather take 
a tour of the city\ back nllep, Jc~em:J 
train yards, and ab:mJom:d factones. s.lm 
prefers street life 10 srill life. the urban 
landscape ro oil lanJ~cnpc:;. graffiu to da 
, -mci. 

Grnfnu, Sam rcwgnizes, is a loaded 
term. It's as loaded as a can of spray 
paint under pressure. h loaJcd .Is a lone 
~'Ord on a concrete can\"as in an innL·r 
city. As loaded as the art collccror who. 
at a London art auction 10 L';lrly h:bruary. 
coughed up S191,000 for a canvas image: 
of Kate Moss spmr·paintnl by the English 
grnffiti artist known only as "ltmksy." 

The spark that charges graffiti is the 
same one thar electrifies the conHicr 
between one man's 
\"andalisrn 
and 
another's Venus dc ~hlo. "Cmffiti\ tics 
to lup-hop culrure makL· It pretty rnJical," 
Sam explains. Those ne::o run Jeep. In the 
lup-hop holy trinity, rap is the medium 
of oral e.xprcs5ion, brL-ak dancing of 
physical expression, and graffiu the mode 
of visual expression. "Graffiti is JUSt p:m 
of a way of life," says ~;un. Bur hkc ~o 
much of urban \.mcncan subculrurc, 
grnffiri has suffered rrusrcprcsentarion 
and crimin:ili:r.arion in mamstrcam society. 

Just as the contro\"ersl31 rhymes of a 
handful of prominent gangsta mpper; 
have earned rhe mustcal genre a bad 
rnp, so, too, ha~ the es,cncc of graffiu 
been skewed by a f~·w prominent aw~ts. 

"The vast majority of people involved in 
(graffiti) are not nearly as deStructive as 
the people on the surface," says Sam. 
'lot that grnffiri enthusiasts would 
argue that sprny-painting private property 
i:-o legal. It is mcontro,·erribly illegal-
indeed, Sam requested to have his name 
\\ithhcld, and many grnffiri artists sign 
their work with nicknames, "rags," which 
("lcllitate a quick geraway and also conceal 
their 1dentities. 

Bur grnffiri, also known as "tagging," 
is perhaps more threatening ro the powers 
that be nor because of how the art form 
is ~:xpressed but rather because of what 
it expresses. Grnffiti artists' usc of rhe 
medium to articulate the societal ills and 
social unrest bred by urban inequalities 
has done as much for graffiti art's minted 
reputation as the form's controversial 
canvases. Tagging is known as an avenue 
of anti-esrablishment expression, whether 
of rebellious poliocal messages, such as the 
famous 1970 rag, "Dick Ni.xon before he 
dicks you," or even controversial religious 
idea.", like the doctrine com·eyed by the 
legendary London slogan, "Clapron is 
God." "1 r's real and raw," Sam says, "and 
th.,t ~cares people." 

Sam is not only a grnffiti appreciator 
but .Jso a grnffiti artist. He certainly 
doe:> nor consider himself a criminal. "1 
don't understand how any art could be 
looked ar as crime," says Sam. Growing 
up in a small tO\\n in the '\orthwest, he 
always admired street art from afar. He 
ne\·er ragged until he moved to the Elm 
City. "You can do sruff wtth spta} prunt 
that you can't do with a brush or on a 
computer. [t has its own look to u." \Yith 
an attention to technique befitting his art 
maJor, he explains, "You can uulize the 
way the paint does drip, and you ha'Ve the 
option of hard edges or soft edges." Still, 
he harbors no illusions about graffin's 
embatded srarus as art. '~\ lor of people 
\\-ho look at classic art forms rrught not 
appreciate it." 

Bur ~>raffiti is. in fact, one of the 
world's oldest art forms. The prehistoric 
ancestors of mankind who expressed 
themselves on the walls of the La~caux 
caves \\'ere not only humanity's first 
arust.': rher were also our first taggers. 
\X'aU-·writing caught on \\;th our dist:lnt 
ancestors for the same reason it gained 
appeal m modem times. "It's so easy to 
do," says Sam. "It'~ just a can, you know. 
You go to the store and drop $3.50, and 
you're ready to rag." Tag art's com·enience 
facilitated irs modern resurgence among 
members of underground culture in 
Philadelphia and '\ew York City during 
the anriestablishmenr '60s and '70s, when 
graffiti quickly became a popular and 
populist art form. Even the etymology of 
the word graffiti. whose ancient ancestor 
is the Greck verb graphtin, "to write," 
reflects its deep roors in human culture. 

Graffiti 
i~ 
a 
reflection of 
the 
ennronment on irs environment. Because 
of its illegalir:y, taggmg embodies the 
pur:;uit of ultimate artistic freedom. "You 
can't put bounds on art," says Sam. So he 
takes the work! as his art's subject and his 
art's surface.
