**A New Commons for All of Yale**

The proposition is this: turn Commons and 
Woolsey Hall into a university community 
center, a new Commons for all of Yale. 
Such a center should be a place that cuts 
across the academic, residential and social 
barriers that fragment this community; it 
should be a place that welcomes students, 
faculty, staff and people from New Haven 
into its halls. 

Woolsey Hall and Commons already 
have many advantages and uses. Sited at 
the heart of the University, providing the 
critical link between the older campus and 
the newer science centers and future resi-
dential campus along Prospect Street, they 
are already the New Haven community's 
principal connection with the University. 
Commons is used for banquets on an aver-
age of once a week, and many of these are 
held by non-Yale groups. Woolsey Hall is 
used three time a week for symphony con-
certs, rock concerts and high school gradu-
ations. They face out upon one of the best 
places for a demonstration anywhere, the 
Beinecke Plaza, which with some minor 
surgery could become a very pleasant ur-
ban space filled with activity and people. 

The buildings themselves are basically 
simple structures, suited to remodeling 
and possessing a vast amount of unused 
and wasted space. 

The facilities in the new center would 
encourage the informal meetings and so-
cial activities that the more restricted aca-
demic and residential centers now deny. 
The heart of the center should be a new 
Yale Station. It is a facility that draws 
almost everyone to it daily. Along with 
serving as a center for the distribution of 
mail, it is the communication hub of the 
University with its bulletin boards, posters, 
notices, salesmen and recruiters appealing 
to all who enter. The present Yale Station 
was created in 1900 and moved to Wright 
Hall after Berkeley College was built. Its 
location there was supposed to be tem-
porary. There are now 1800 student boxes, 
and the overcrowding is so severe that the 
Post Office is threatening to close down 
unless a new arrangement can be planned 
very soon. The new station should be lo-
cated on the main floor of Commons and 
be visually and spacially related to th~

home of Yale's three film societies which 
now use the uncomfortable, inadequate 
and unventilated facilities in Linsly-Chlt-
tenden Hall. Space could be leased to 
commercial establishments such as a new 
university bookstore offering a good va-
riety of magazines and underground news-
papers-and, if we're lucky, a place to 
sit and read. 

There is also enough room to provide 
ample new office space for student organi-
zations. WYBC, the Banner, the Lit, the 
Record, APO and the Associated Student 
Agencies are looking for space because of 
the planned destruction of Hendrie Hall 
in December, 1970. In the rotunda would 
be located the new Information and Tour 
Bureau, providing assistance to thousands 
of visitors who come to the campus an-
nually. 

Woolsey Hall needs remodeling also. 
Although the acoustics in the hall leave 
something to be desired and are essen-
tially impossible to improve, the seating 
could be replaced and a new entrance 
lobby could be built along the Beinecke 
Plaza side of the hall to accommodate 
crowds at intermissions. Master Beekman 
Cannon of Jonathan Edwards College, 
President of the New Haven Symphony, 
stated that Woolsey Hall is essential to the 
community and that no new facility was 
forseen even in the distant future. There 
is a desperate need, he says, to accommo-
date crowds of people at intermission, 
to provide better exits, new seating and a 
place for refreshments. 

A super snack bar open 24 hours every 
day would be included in the scheme. With 
easy access to the libraries and classrooms 
it would become a welcome, reliable oasis 
for weary students and professors. During 
the warmer months an outdoor cafe on the 
plaza would be set up offering an excellent 
place to meet and to indulge in people 
watching. Dorothy Kalins's analysis of out-
door cafes in New York Magazine gives an 
indication of Beinecke Plaza's desirability 
as a cafe site. 

Outdoor cafes in New York have never 
really made it as successful looking-places. 
The main problem is distance. Sidewalks 
simply are not wide enough. So the cafe turns

ones, and when carried out we shall have 
one of the noblest examples of college 
architecture in the whole civilized world. 
... On this two hundredth anniversary of 
the founding of the College, the structures 
we raise shall last a thousand years." 

The idea of a new university community 
center is not hopelessly unrealistic. The 
space for all these activities exists already. 
The dining room is 208 feet long, 60 feet 
high and 68 feet wide; it can seat about 
1200 people. The roof trusses are made of 
beam~ 18 inches square, carved from huge 
Jogs towed by ship from Seattle around 
Cape Horn to New Haven in 1899. 

Woolsey Hall, named after the tenth 
President of Yale, seats 3000 people and 
is connected to Commons by Memorial 
Hall, honoring the Yale men killed in the 
nation's wars. Above the Rotunda is the 
President's Room, with dining space for 
144 people, and above that a huge domed 
room with an oculus, now used to store 
a collection of musical instruments. These 
buildings could be remodeled without de-
stroying their beauty. The facilities sug-
gested are just a few of many that might 
be included in the center. However, this 
community is in for a rude shock if it ex-
pects Mother Yale to provide the necessary 
funds to make the center a reality. The 
reasons are many. Why should Yale worry 
about the social life of its junior faculty 
or graduate students? They're old enough 
to fend for themselves. Why should a 
social center have greater priority than 
libraries, laboratories, dormitories or con-
tributions to Mayor Lee? A new Commons 
would rank low on a list of priorities. The 
reasons go on; but the picture is clear, 
and students and faculty continue to press 
for a solution to the problem. 

There is currently a valid desire being ex-
pressed by students and faculty to be in-
cluded in the decision-making processes of 
this institution. In the realm of the the so-
cial life of the University, the right of the 
community to decide on its own social pat-
terns and facilities is clearly evident. Here 
is one way this could be accomplished:

constructed at the level of the existing bal-
conies and window sills would be the new 
banquet hall. It would retain the sense of 
spaciousness of the old Commons yet pro-
vide its patrons with views of the Plaza and 
the cemetery and a more pleasant and 
cheerful environment in which to eat and 
relax. Its serving lines would be open to 
everyone for lunch, catering specifically 
to the graduate students, faculty and staff 
with restricted transfers to undergraduates. 
A number of private dining rooms would 
be provided to serve the great demand for 
a suitable spot for departmental and staff 
lunches as well as student-organization 
lunches. 

In the basement there is room for a five-
hundred seat auditorium-cinema where 
lectures and classes could be held during 
the day. At night it would become the new

and railings, somehow removing the voyeur-
istic mystique that Parisian cafes have so long 
nurtured .... The only outdoor cafe that 
works in the city is the Park Cafe at Bethesda 
· Fountain. Tables are far enough apart ... 
and dining areas line aisles especially geared 
for prime entrance-and-exit-watching .... 
The quality of distance is vital to voyeuristic 
experience, particularly in public spaces. 
Actually, Beinecke Plaza is not Beinecke 
Plaza at all; it is the Hewitt Quadrangle. 
The Beineckes are said to be very touchy 
about this distinction, especially when a 
demonstration occurs there and it is later 
reported in the Times as Beinecke Plaza. 
Looks bad for the family and all that. 
Woolsey Hall and Commons, designed 
by the New York firm of Carrere and 
Hastings, were erected in 1900 as the 
Bicentennial Buildings. They were built in 
just over a year at a cost of $750,000. 
President Hadley, speaking to the New 
York Yale Ch,1b, declared: ''The plans 
The corporation board would oeefected 
by all the members of the Yale community 
and would be composed of faculty, stu-
dents and staff. Suppose further that reno-
vation of these buildings were to cost two 
million dollars and that a mortgage was 
arranged by Yale out of its investment 
funds. Each member of the community 
might be taxed a small amount to cover 
the payment of the mortgage and operating 
expenses, although it is assumed that the 
dining hall and auditoriums would con-
tinue to be self supporting. This scheme 
would permit the community to make its 
own decisions and would skirt the problem 
of competing for the University's financial 
resources. 

For a community center to be successful 
the community must decide what it wants 
and then act. If it waits for Yale, then it 
must accept the delays, the compromises 
and the continuing dullness as a reward 
for its own inaction.
