der. Jesus, he thought, when are these 
people going to give up their hold on the 
Old West? Will they always be proving 
themselves men with their fists and guns? 
Would America's hero ideal never surpass 
John Wayne? All his mind's eye could see 
was the vision of SMU's Voight with his 
nostrils distended and his little pig eyes 
blinking and glaring, sightless with bestial 
rage. He'd probably make a great soldier, 
Dan thought; at least his hair was short. 


He talked with Paul Oliver as the team 
walked from the gym to the hotel. Paul 
was a quiet Negro from Alabama, and 
Dan decided that, this night at least, he 路 
was the bravest man in Dallas. He had 
stayed out of the fight even when Glenn 
was attacked, and he explained why. 
"I've been in fights like that before. 
Where I come from in Alabama, people 
don't go out to push and shove; they go out 
to hurt and kill. Every fight I've ever been 
in was a racial one; if I had gone into that 
fight tonight, I would have really hurt 
someone. 


He hadn't joined the battle because he 
preferred to do violence to his self-esteem 
rather than to another man. It took a lot 
of courage to do that, and a lot of pride 
and assurance in his own masculinity. Dan 
felt the admiration and frustration he 
always felt when he met a peaceful man. 
It was the desire to just do what's human. 
He knew acid made this the biggest desire 
in the world, and he didn't wonder that 
he had not seen any hippies in Dallas. He 
left Paul with a helpless sigh and went 
looking for some marijuana. 


His lungs tingled from the smoke and his 
head felt very light. Grass was such a 
pleasant, relaxing high after exerting one-
self. It might not be good before a game, 
but afterwards it sure beat salt tablets. 
Unfortunately, he didn't think he could 
ever get the NCAA to sanction it. 


Paul Harvey was on the TV, about 
to deliver a commentary. He had just done 
the live commercial before, so Dan as-
sumed that he operated out of Dallas. It 
made sense. Harvey's commentary was in 
honor of the American Legion, whose 
memorial day or week was imminent. He 
spoke of the men who had fought in a 
"better war"; of men who had fought in 
trenches without gas masks, morphine, the 
USO, or proper equipment; and of men 
who had come back to face a depression 
after exerting themselves on the battlefield. 
These were the men who thought America 
valuable enough to fight and die for. We 
owe them all the honor they deserve. 
Harvey's voice broke at this point and he 
was openly in tears. At a loss for words, 
he ended with a wave of the hand. 


Dan was on the verge of nausea. Such 
maudlin sentimentality was almost un-
believable. The past efforts of these men 
did not change the situation today. 


H e found it to be one of the greatest 
of sins to use past heroics as an excuse for 
present crimes. World War I just didn't 
make it as a justification for a war that 
affected Dan, not all the senile old soldiers 
drooling on their yellowing battle ribbons. 
But again, he remembered he was in 
Dallas, where such things did go on. This 
made H arvey's absurdity painful rather 
路 than laughable. 


The sports news followed and contained 
a brief account of the brawl. It made no 
comment on the contest other than that 
Yale had lost, and Gene Phillips had been 
set upon by two Yale players. Dan brooded 
over the reports of Viet Cong losses given 
earlier. There was a connection, he 
thought, but he couldn't quite put his fin-
ger on it. He gave up and returned his at- 路 
tention to the news. 


The sports announcer was defaming the 
character of Don Meredith, Dallas Cow-
boys' quarterback. He was interviewing a 路 
team-mate of Meredith's and was feeding 
him rather damaging leading questions 
such as: "Do you think Don will ever re-
cover from such a public humiliation as 
the Cleveland game? Do you expect any 
major personnel changes in the near 
future?" The teammate fended the queries 
off as well as he could, but it was clear at 
the end of the interview where Meredith 
stood in the eyes of the community. In 
closing, the announcer quoted a New York 
reporter who had said of Meredith, "It 
must be hard on a guy when he realizes 
he's one of life's losers." 


Meredith had not only had a poor 
football game; his team had not only lost 
the Eastern Division title; he had totally 
disgraced himself as a man, as a human 
being. One could not afford to lose in 
Dallas. Losers did not belong there. Real 
men had to win every game, fight and war 
or else die trying. It was the American 
Way. Dan suddenly felt very claustropho-
bic; he was glad they were leaving the 
town the next day. Right now a drugged 
sleep was the best refuge from the reac-
tionaries that haunted his waking hours. 


The Dallas papers the next morning re-
ferred to the Yale players as the "long-
hairs from Yale" and carried much the 
same story of the game as the newscast of 
the previous evening. Dan read the ac-
counts as they waited for the cabs to the 
airport. One even credited Yale with win-
ning the fight, though not the game. 


He thought about H. L. Hunt, the game 
and Dallas in general as the cab sped to-
ward Dallas International Airport. Dallas 
was the town in which Kennedy bad been 
assassinated; it was Lyndon Johnson terri-
tory; it was the only major city to go for 
Richard Nixon. Dan knew that Dallas 
country was one place where he could 
never live. They wouldn't tolerate his kind 
here. It was an America to which he 
couldn't belong and one which he couldn't 
allow himself to join. The attitudes it em-
braced, the battles it fought and the way 
it fought them, he could not support. He 
knew that the only way of life for him was 
one of resistance to the Dallas conscious-
ness which he knew existed everywhere in 
America, usually in more subtle forms. 


By this time, the plane was ready for 
boarding. He headed up the hallway to-
ward the plane, stopping for his last look 
at the Dallas airport. He raised his finger 
defiantly in salute, and as he headed into 
the plane, he could be heard to mutter 
under his breath, "Hot damn, Vietnam."~
