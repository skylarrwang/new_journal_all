You can charge anything at Neiman-Marcus, 
except, maybe, masculinity; some Maileresque 
thoughts on why we are in Vietnam. 
by Daniel Peters 
Daniel Peters, an English major and a 
guard on the Yale basketball team, wrote 
this piece as a ·paper for Charles Reich's 
American Studies course. It found its way 
to us and we are printing it so that one 
person may share some interesting and 
honest ideas with the rest of the com-
munity. 

Daniel Peters glanced around the Dallas 
airport, not taking much of it in, feeling 
glad just to be on the ground once more. 
The trip from West Virginia had been a 
long one, and though the sky was cloud-
less, the jet had encountered turbulence as 
it approached Dallas. It was as if the placid 
blue had been a front for the treacherous 
winds that raged below it. 

Most of the team had survived the buf-
feting with few ill effects; after the Alleghe-
ny flight to West Virginia, only a hurricane 
could have appeared horrible in contiTast. 
Of course Bill Kosturko, the third-string 
center, was sick again. He was beginning to 
be known as "Biap-bag·Bill," and his fame 
was spreading from airline to airline. 

In the cab on the way to the hotel, 
Daniel's mind bad reasserted its domi-
nance over his stomach, and he examined 
the passing scenery with the curiosity he 
usually invested in towns he saw for the 
first time. He noted the large variety of 
shrubbery that crowded the yards of the 
homes they passed. "And what kinds t>f 
beasts and reptiles inhabit these }lome-
grown jungles?" he thought. Probably spit-
ing cobras and big old Dallas mountain 
lions. It was startling to see the many 
Lincolns and Cadillacs standing like pagan 
idols in the midst of the slick magnolia 
jungles. The notion of Texas wealth im-
pressed itself on his mind with the dim re-
membrance of some youthful incredulity. 

The Hilton Inn was a huge, vertical 
edifice surrounded by the ubiquitous foli-
age, and it appeared ~o Dan as a modern 
recreation of the Alamo. The hallways 
were spacious and high, and the doors were 
huge bronze slabs. Our friend could almost · 
see a handful of Texans stomping Santa 
Anna's ass right there in the vestibule. 

There was time to work out in the gym 
before dinner, and Dan liked the feel of the 
floor. H~ was looking forward to the next 
day's game mostly because the whole affair 
-an Ivy League team playing basketball 
in Texas-seemed quite strange. It was 
something he bad never pictured as hap-
pening to him, and he had no clear idea 
what the area and its people were like. 

He ate dinner and went back to his 
room, not feeling energetic enough to go 
flicking with some of the others. He de-
cided to read some more Henry James. 
He had already read Daisy Miller and The 
Ambassadors, and they had made him re-
evaluate his ideas on tradition and civiliza-
tion. He had decided that perhaps there 
was something worthwhile in standards of 
taste and conduct. For too long, he had 
been caught up in the type of American 
cultural hubris epitomized by Daisy Miller: 
no ethics except those that suited the 
moment. But that was a moral cop-out, for 
his innocence was not really profound 
enough for him to deserve such absolute 
freedom, and he was not so far beyond 
making judgments of good and evil as he 
would have liked to believe. 

But he soon abandoned his reading to 
go watch the tube. Somehow the big, ster-
ile hotel room was not conducive to the 
kind of concentration and reflection 
needed for James. His mind kept turning 
to the sexual escapades that he so inti-
mately connected with the idea of a hotel 
room. Sleep and all manner of animal 
sport, he thought, that's what hotels are 
good for. 

As he sat before the TV set, Dan heard 
the team captain, Thatcher Shellaby, re-
turn to his room next door. Dan and his 
roommate, John Gahan, greeted Thatcher 
with the usual profanities and animal cries 
that pass with jocks as friendly greetings, 
and he answered in kind. The noise at-
tracted some kids down the hall who were 
having a party. Obviously bored with their 
own fun, they ventured over to see what 
they were missing. 

At first, there were only three guys, all 
neat and sandy-haired, with beers in their 
bands. Thatcher explained that they had 
no party going in their rooms, and politely 
declined an invitation to their party. The 
visitors said that they were from Southern 
Methodist University. The atmosphere 
seemed to change sul?tly when Dan told 
them that he and his friends were from 
Yale. The Texans responded with the "oh" 
which the name of Yale elicits from so 
many and which is ordinarily followed by 
either genuine interest or a little game of 
"Do you know ... ?" But the Texans' re-
sponse was different, probably because 
their girls had arrived. Vague threats 
were being murmured, and the air was full 
of blossoming hostility. Thatcher chose to 
cool it and announced that be was 
going to bed. 

"You'd better get in that room, faggot," 
one of the Texans muttered. Dan stared 
at the speaker, who was wearing a pressed 
white shirt, tie, flannels, short neatly 
combed hair; he was leaning against the 
wall, obviously drunk. He had uttered the 
threat quietly and coldly. 

In a manner quite unbecoming to jocks, 
Dan and John retreated into their own 
room and ignored the subsequent knock, 
presumably a last attempt to draw the 
Northerners into a .fight. 

Dan went to bed puzzling over this and 
dreamed strange dreams of smiling Texans 
bombing the Eiffel Tower.

The confrontation of the previous evening 
seemed no more than a dream when John 
and Dan went to breakfast the next morn-
ing. Dan picked up a copy of the Dallas 
Morning News to read while they waited 
for their food. 

He glanced at the shortest editorial first 
from force of habit. This one was con-
cerned with Texas fruitcake, calling it the 
best in the world. That honor you can 
have, thought Dan magnanimously. The 
editorial then continued to say that, as a 
matter of fact, all Texas food was better 
than that produced elsewhere. It ended by 
saying that all kinds of goods were better 
if Texan, and it urged one to buy Texan, 
for "what Texas makes, makes Texas." 

With this in mind, Dan paid his bill and 
returned to the hotel, where an expedition 
was forming to explore Dallas. 

He joined Thatcher, Bill Kosturko, 
Jack Langer and Larry Swartz in the cab. 
On the way into town he noticed a sign 
advertising Lifeline, H. L. Hunt's con-
servative newspaper. Rob Jackson bad told 
him a little about Hunt's reactionary 
politics: that be reportedly had had veto 
power over George Wallace's running 
mate and had vetoed Happy Chandler 
because of his leniency on the racial ques-
tion. (Jackie Robinson had entered the 
Major Leagues while Chandler was Com-
missioner of Baseball.) 

They unloaded themselves from the

cab in front of Nieman-Marcus, the Texas 
department store. Dan vaguely recalled a 
statistic he had beard that a credit rating 
of something in the neighborhood of fifty 
thousand doJlars was mandatory for a 
Nieman-Marcus charge account. He was 
not long in discovering why. 

Nothing appeared out of line with the 
department stores of his past acquaintance 
until Dan began to check the price tags. 
On the third floor he discovered the gift 
gaJiery, which was a collection of decora-
tive items for the home. He examined a 
three foot high statue-price $1750.It was 
an antique from Hong Kong. A small vase 
went fer the same price, and the silver-
ware department carried gold table-set-
tings of which one candlestick alone 
cost $600. The fifteen-dollar ties and 
sixty-dollar slacks finally got to Dan and 
drove him downstairs and out the front 
door, where as he left be caught sight of 
Pearl Baily's personal Christmas tree, 
$35,000 in pearls. 

The idea of a department store for 
millionaires struck him as the most ex-
treme excess that be had ever seen. Did 
being able to support the expense of such 
exhibition make a man or a community 
feel that it was somehow "better than 
others"? He was reminded of a boy he had 
o~ce known who always had more toy sol-
diers and guns than anyone else; who, in 
fact was alway dragging out more toys than 
he could ever use himself. All the other 
kids thought this habit rather pathetic, 
but no one was willing to call him on it 
- he did have the biggest arsenal in the 
neighborhood. 

Returning to his room to wait for the 
pregame training meal, Dan tried to make 
some further headway in James. He was 
beginning to doze off when he heard a 
knock on the door.lt was Thatcher with 
Kathy O'Boyle, a Sarah Lawrence girl he 
knew from Yale, whom be bad run into 
in Nieman-Marcus. She was home for 
Christmas and was trying to find some 
entertainment for them in Dallas. Rob 
! ackson and Glenn DeChabert popped 
10 and asked her where they could find 
some action. 

She began to call nightclubs, explaining 
that the best entertainment was to be had 
in "Africa". Although rather incredulous 
at the title, they figured "Africa" must be 
Dallas's black district. Glenn, a black him-
self, said, "Damn. In Los Angeles they 
call it Watts; in New York they call it 
:riarlem; but in DaiJas they call it Africa. 
Shit." 

Products of adolescent-repressive 
America, they asked the question that has 
haunted the dreams of so many teenagers, 
namely: "Will they card us at the clubs 
in Africa?'' Kathy replied quite calmly 
that the only thing they ever checked for 
was a gun. They couldn't be quite sure how 
much her calm demeanor was calculated 
to add to the shock value of her statement. 

Dan remembered from the news that there 
had been eighteen shooting deaths in the 
state over the weekend. He, for'one, was 
ready to believe her. 

After Kathy had left, and they were 
waiting for the training meal, Thatch told 
them that he had seen two maids, a Rolls 
Royce, a Porsche and a Lincoln at her 
house that afternoon. Dan again found 
himself searching for some connection 
between this affluence and her calm accept-
ance of violence. Did that much money 
give one a grand indifference to injury or 
was it the power-masculinity thing again? 
He wondered if someone could blatantly 
'llUCder or steal in this town if he had 
enough money and influence. He didn't 
doubt it. But his speculations were cut 
short by the coach explaining the two-one-
two zone, and he decided it was time to 
start thinking about basketball.

The pregame warmup held nothing un-
usual. There were a few catcalls concern-
ing Jackson's and Whiston's hair and 
Peters' sideburns, but they had become 
inured to such remarks. The Dallas papers 
had prepared the fans for the Yale players' 
appearance and the Yalies for the verbal 
abuse by remarking that "Morgan led Yale 
in scoring and Whiston led in haircuts." 

The SMU band struck up "Old-Time 
Religion" as their team took the court to 
warm up. This was one of the favorites 
they alternated with "Dixie" and ''The 
Eyes of Texas." The "Star-Spangled Ban-
ner" had not been played, but Dan figured 
that the substitutes would do well enough 
for those present. It was the feeling that 
counted. 

Yale opened in a zone and promptly ran 
into defensive problems. SMU was able to 
penetrate far enough inside to suck the 
Yale guards in, and then they were pitch-
ing out for the open jump shot. SMU was 
hitting well enough from the outside to 
take a ten point lead by half time. The first 
half was a ragged one for Yale, with too 
many errors and not enough defense. It 
was also a rough half, for SMU was crash-
ing the boards hard, and the referees were 
unusually lenient on body contact. 

The second half promised to be even 
rougher. Yale was going out in a man-to-
man with pressure at half court, deter-
mined to bit the boards harder. The coach 
reminded them that SMU considered this 
game a breeze, a warmup for the games 
coming up. They didn't expect a real 
contest from an Ivy League team; it was 
taken for granted that intellectuals from 
the East couldn't compete physically with 
Texas athletes. Why intellectualism should 
be equated to physical ineptitude was a 
mystery to Dan, but, referring to memory, 
he could confirm it as an attitude domi-
nating all his childhood athletic ventures. 
As a kid, you were a pansy if you pre-
ferred books to baseball and a sissy if you 
weren't prepared to play rough or dirty, 
or to lie in order to win. Sportsmanship 
was a shake of the hand after the melee 
was over. 

In the second half Yale's defense tight-
ened and their fast break began to operate 
effectively. The refs let the game become 
rougher than the first half. John Whiston, 
the Yale center, went in for a Jay-up on 
the fast break and was laid out fiat on his 
back by an SMU player. No foul was 
called. The mayhem under the boards was 
even more flagrant, but the Yale players 
seemed to give as well as they received. 
The tide was turning; Yale was slowly 
narrowing SMU's lead. Resting on the 
bench, Dan noticed that the fans became 
more frantic as Ynle edged closer. He 
also noticed for the first time that all the 
blacks were sitting together in one section 
behind one of the baskets. They were 
mostly black girls and they were cheering 
for Yale. Dan guessed that their favoritism 
was chiefly due to Glenn's presence on the 
team, for he was a very handsome fellow 
and seemed to attract black girls wherever 
he went. 

The referees' decisions became more du-
bious as Yale pulled within four points 
of SMU. Every time Yale threatened to tie 
or pull ahead, the refs charged them with
