the faculty, but SDS finds them totally 
unacceptable. No one really has any idea 
of what is going to happen, and there con-
tinues to exist the Corporation's threat to 
close down the university. 


The situation, then, is a difficult one to 
analyze, for it has become evident that 
Harvard is not following the standard 
script of disruption, polarization and 
bitterness-at least not yet. There is still a 
remarkably good atmosphere in the Yard; 
there really is some dialogue going on, and 
SDS passed a motion tonight wishlng Dean 
Ford a speedy recovery from his "circula-
tory disorder." These factors suggest that 
there really is a chance of unifying the 
Harvard community. But the responsi-
bility for this lies with the ruling structure 
-the Corporation and the Board of Over-
seers. If they ignore the legitimate griev-
ances among students and faculty, they 
may well destroy a great university; if they 
act wisely, something unprecedented might 
well occur and H arvard could emerge a 
far better place. 


Meanwhile, I only wish it would rain 
a little more often.

**Title: Heroic struggle**
**Author: Peter Yaeger**

Heroic struggle 
When Massachusetts state troopers 
clubbed Harvard SDS two weeks ago, the 
"Heroic Struggle of Yale Law Students," 
as one sign described recent events here, 
was upstaged and expired. Lagging student 
interest killed whatever chance there had 
been for an effective boycott of classes, 
and the issue of student representation at 
meetings of the law faculty was remanded 
to the respective negotiating committees. 


The quieting influence of "the Yale tra-
dition," or whatever else is used to explain 
the absence of physical tactics here, wanes 
every year, as Yale is seen by more and 
more students as merely one university 
among many. This isn't necessarily good 
or bad; it happens. Garry Trudeau's car-
toon strip in the Aprilll News is brilliant 
in seeing this: as a shirt-sleeved Kingman 
Brewster strolls the campus seeing himself 
as John Lindsay in summer Harlem, 
Georges May bursts his thought baJloon 
with the news that SDS has moved into the 
presidential home. To the law students, 
more than three-quarters of whom did not 
attend Yale College, "the Yale tradition" 
means even Jess than it does to the under-
graduates. 


This is not to sound the alarm for old 
Mother Yale nor to suggest that the Law 
School will spearhead anything like a 
revolution here. Student-power protests, 
anyway, are less revolutions than con-
sumers' battles for a say in corporate 
policy. Several things about the events at 
the Law School do, however, deserve com-
ment as close-to-home examples of char-
acteristics which seem common to most 
recent protests. 


Fireworks began when the Student 
Negotiating Committee (SNC), which was 
elected last fall to deal with its faculty 
counterpart, ended negotiations and sche-
duled an open meeting for April 7 to 
discuss the latest faculty proposals. These 
called for the institutionalization of what 
had developed on an ad hoc basis during 
the year: non-voting student representa-
tion on most faculty committees and 
at the faculty plenary meetings which 
entertain proposals drafted by those com-
mittees. The SNC demanded voting rep-
resentation at all faculty meetings and 
on committees except for those dealing 
confidentially with individuals; the stu-
dent-faculty ratio would be about 1 to 3. 
Also provided for was a faculty veto of 
decisions reached in this "Law School 
Council," a veto which the students hoped 
would soon atrophy through disuse. 


The open meeting, with a record turnout 
of over 300 students, quickly turned into 
a circus-rhetoric instead of reason, mock-
ing laughter punctuated with angry ex-
changes, gratuitous insults and a proposal 
to burn down the school, which was 
withdrawn shortly before it was put to a 
vote. Commendations are in order. 


Firstly, to whoever selected Dean Pollak 
and Eugene Rostow to represent the 
faculty on the podium: whatever one may 
think of Rostow personally, he was without 
doubt the worst possible choice for such 
a task. The idea that Jaw students here 
will trust their interests to the good faith 
of a hawkish Johnson adviser is too much 
to swallow, When Rostow spoke of de-
cisions which only the faculty, in its 
professional competence, could make, 
whatever credibility he may have pos-
sessed evaporated. Dean Pollak was little 
better; he was noticeably nervous and 
angry, and his main presentation consisted 
of 15-minutes' rapid reading of a prepared 
statement. One student compared him to a 
prep school headmaster reading the Riot 
Act. Thomas Emerson, who spoke calmly 
from the ftoor of his sympathy with cer-
tain of the student demands and who 
headed the faculty negotiators anyway, 
would have been a better choice than either 
Rostow or Pollak. The same is true of 
Boris Bittker and Clyde Summers. 


The SNC's chairman, Michael Egger, 
also lowered the level of the proceedings 
with several condescending and unfunny 
remarks directed at the Dean. He repeated-
ly reminded Pollak that he attended the · 
meeting in the Jaw school auditorium at 
the students' sufferance; he also asked the 
students to time and hold the Dean's 
speech to a carefully measured five 
minutes, remarking at its close that, "Dean 
Pollak's idea of five minutes is obviously 
not the same as mine." When I told Egger 
afterwards how much the tone of the 
meeting had disturbed me and others of 
his "constituents," he said that Dean 
Pollak had treated him no better at are-
cent faculty meeting. 


It was my impression that most students 
walked into the meeting expecting to be 
informed and consulted. We found instead 
that the Jines of argument had hardened; 
the many charges and distortions which 
crossed the auditorium set a tone remi-
niscent of the late NYC transit strike. We 
were treated to a prepared statement that 
denounced the Law School as a "pater-
nalistic and oligarchic society,'' while 
another termed the faculty proposals a 
"cooptive and supplicative scheme." These 
drew laughter and applause for their "wit" 
which I found hard to reconcile with the 
quiet and even eloquent statements of Gus 
Speth and Walt Waggoner, who with 
Egger represented the SNC on the podium. 


In the end the students endorsed a pro-
posal by D an Lewis that they devote class 
time to discussion of the issues with their 
professors and then hold a referendum. 
Many classes did this. Typically, the stu-
dents likened the Jaw school to a body 
politic, while the professors insisted it was 
not a political institution and spoke of 
the faculty's need to yell at one another 
in private, where they could not be mis-
understood. There appeared the Students 
to H elp Increase The Faculty's Authority 
and Control over Everything (yes, it's an 
acronym), which bought a keg for the 
courtyard and scheduled a croquet-game-
cum-PBK-keys. 


The referendum, which polled over 
86% of the students, resulted in a very 
close division, the SNC proposal trailing 
only slightly behind a compromise pro-
posal which did away with student voting 
but went beyond the faculty proposal in 
asking for more regular student presence 
at faculty meetings. At a second and more 
subdued open meeting a week later, about 
150 students voted to send the whole 
matter back for more negotiations. It 
seems likely that the committees will agree 
to something like the compromise pro-
posal and that a second referendum will 
ratify it. 


The whole thing seemed to be summed 
up by one student who, on hearing 
Rostow's remark to the first meeting that 
"the klink of Phi Beta Kappa keys here 
can be heard all the way to Yale Station,'' 
said, "We are always told how clever we 
are at the very meetings which disprove it."

**Title: Deja Vu**
**Author: Theodore A. Burrell**

Deja Vu 
There is a demoralizing sense of deja vu 
after three or four years of peace march-
ing. It is all rather like being caught up in a 
cocktail party syndrome, where the faces 
blur one into another, where the con-
versations seem strangely familiar, where 
the host is too much a frustrated showman 
and where the whole point of the evening 
is too quickly obscured. 


As the passing weeks relegate the April 5 
inter-city mobilization to the jumble of 
peace-march memories, it seems more and 
more that it should have been different. 
Certainly, the anti-war movement has been 
remarkably hospitable to our new Presi-
dent: while he fiddled with administrative 
stalls and tne bodies burned, we took up 
other tangentially related causes, largely 
centering on the conditions and implica-
tions of military service, out of respect for 
the Nixon Administration's avowed efforts 
to end the war. With four months evapo-
rated, however, the American death toll 
surpassed 33,000, the figures took a deep 
sigh and leapt above the death toll of the 
entire Korean War, and Secretary Rodgers 
spoke of the absolute necessity for main-
taining totally secret negotiations. Such 
carnage and secrecy, anathema to the 
peace movement, served as catalysts for 
the spring protests. The movement had to 
firmly restate its conviction to bring the 
war to a halt. That Good Friday, April4, 
marked the first anniversary of Dr. Martin 
Luther King's assassination as well, could 
not have gone unnoticed by the planners 
of the march. 


So fifty thousand marchers assembled 
in New York's Bryant Park (near the 
Public Library), placed a traditional 
wreath and walked quietly north through 
CentraJ Park. It began to rain. By the time 
the multitude had passed the Zoo, the 
Sheep Meadow and the Tavern-on-the-
G reen, they were soaked. Led by a surpris-
ingly large contingent of off-duty service-
men, the crowd gathered at the Bandshell, 
where scores of young cops and a police 
helicopter greeted them. As the rain and 
speakers poured on, some of the more 
bedraggled marchers drifted away to take 
refuge in the Frick Collection museum. 


Dave Dellinger commended the service-
men on their willingness to lead such a 
march and noted that the anti-war move-
ment had happily reached into the ranks 
of the armed forces. Howard Zion criti-
cized, "Something is very wrong with the 
political system of this country, something 
is wrong with the economic system .... 
The rich have always run this country, 
making millions off poor people's chil-
dren." The typically small numbers of 
black and Puerto Rican marchers ap· 
plauded this but were somewhat less 
moved by Abbie Hoffman's call for revo-
lution. A great many Cuban flags were in 
evidence, and chants to free the Panther 21 
emerged, spontaneously, at several points. 


The planned entertainment stretched on 
into the early evening, and the crowd 
quietly, soggily, dispersed. 


Perhaps the event Jacked excitement: 
much as the war has droned on, year after 
year, so too has the peace movement. The 
Pentagon confrontation took place over 
15 months ago, and it has been years since 
the first protests began. Some of the early 
protesters have since fled to Canada or 
been killed in Vietnam, and while the 
crowd age seems to remain about the same, 
for many of us, this type of action has 
gone increasingly tedious. Perhaps, as 
Jerry Rubin recently wrote, "America 
proved deaf, and our dreams proved inno-
cent. Scores of our brothers have become 
inactive and cynical. ... Our search for 
adventure and heroism takes us outside 
America, to a life of self-creation andre-
bellion. In response, America is ready to 
destroy us. . . . " 


While the physical destruction takes 
place abroad, attrition has taken a heavy 
psychological toll at home. This march 
lacked the enthusiasm of earlier protests 
not entirely because of the rain (fifty thou-
sand did show up in spite of the bad weath-
er) but more because of an incredible sense 
of impotence and desperation that has 
overcome the marchers. We saw the mo-
ment of our greatness flicker when LBJ 
chose not to run again; now, strangely, the 
body seems willing, almost as a reflex, 
but the spirit protests. 


More important, however, is the fact 
that this Administration has become numb 
to some forms of protest. Crime in the 
streets applies to colJege campuses, but 
peace marchers will, by and large, be ig-
nored. If the administration is, in fact, to 
be put on notice, it must first become aware 
of its petitioners, and we will have to seek 
a new set of tactics to produce this aware-
ness. 


Meanwhile, the war drags on. Last 
week's Times stated, "The Nixon Adminis-
tration has set in motion an essentially 
secret program of diplomatic and military 
measures designed to extricate the United 
States from Vietnam." Sometimes there is 
an appealing sense of deja vu . ...
