harmony was maintained. De facto recog-
nition was given by Chiang to the Com-
munists' Border Area government in the 
provinces of Shensi, Kansu and Ninghsia, 
and they were encouraged to conduct 
guerrilla operations against the Japanese 
in the northeastern area of Shansi, Chahar 
and Hopei. For their part the Communists, 
still shaky from their near defeat, and 
anxious to maintain good relations with 
the wealthier peasants in their base areas, 
had adopted a moderate program of rent 
reduction iostead of pushing for land re-
distribution, and had established the 
structure for a democratic government. 
This was the "Yenan Communism" that 
so appealed to the few Western observers 
who were able to get through to Shensi. 
They found the Communists tolerant, 
cheerful, courageous and pragmatic, and 
they reported their findings to an absorbed 
Western readership. 

Bethune was as delighted as anyone, and 
noted the contrasts between the Com-
munist and the Nationalist areas that he 
had seen: "In Hankow I found confusion, 
indecision, depressing signs of bureaucracy 
and inefficiency. In Yenan there is a sense 
of confidence and purpose in administra-
tive circles. In the towns and cities I passed 
through on my way here I became ac-
customed to the sights of semi-feudalism-
filthy dwellings, polluted streets, people in 
rags. Here, among the ancient structures, 
the streets are clean, teeming with people 
who seem to know where they're going." 

He had a lengthy interview with Mao, who 
impressed him by his knowledge of the 
Loyalist political and military leaders in 
the Spanish Civil War and was enthusi-
astic about Bethune's plan for setting up 
mobile base hospitals. He found Mao con-
vinced of the Chinese people's will to 
resist, and of the inevitability of their final 
victory, however long that might take. 
"The man is a giant!" wrote Bethune after 
the interview was over. "He is one of the 
great men of our world." 

Bethune lingered only three weeks in 
Yenan, to assemble supplies and a small 
staff, before moving out to join General 
Nieh Jung-chen's troops who were en-
sconced in the mountains between Shansi 
and Hopei. Here be was formally named 
"Medical Adviser to the Chin-Cha-Chi 
Military District," and treated his first 
Communist patients: "The wounded are 
crawling with lice. They all have only one 
uniform, and that they have on. It is filthy 
with the accumulated dirt of nine months' 
fighting. Their bandages have been washed 
so often they are now nothing but dirty 
rags. Three men, one with the loss of both 
feet through frost-bite gangrene, have no 
clothes at all to wear. There is only a 
coverlet for them. Their food is boiled 
millet-that's all. All are anaemic and 
underfed. Most of them are slowly dying 
of sepsis and starvation. Many have tuber-
culosis." It was worse even than Spain, but 
Bethune felt a definite sense of exaltation, 
for this was his true destination. "I am in 
the centre of the centre of the war. Now I 
can truly taste the strange, exalted ftavor 
of this stupendous struggle." 

This was guerrilla war: small groups of 
Communist troops, cooperating with local 
peasant partisans, to harass the Japanese 
all over north China. They filled in the 
defensive ditches dug by the Japanese, cut 
telephone and power lines, derailed trains, 
blew bridges. Isolated detachments of 
Japanese troops would be surrounded and 
killed, their captured weapons going to 
arm fresh guerrillas; occasionally a Jap-
anese convoy or blockhouse might be 
attacked by Communist forces of battalion 
strength or greater. Before Japanese re-
inforcements could be brought up, the 
guerrillas would retreat back to the moun-
tains, the partisans return to their villages. 
Under these villages were networks of 
tunnels, growing in length and complexity 
each year of the war, where food, weapons, 
and the soldiers themselves could be 
hidden. At first the Japanese responded 
sluggishly, but as the guerrilla attacks 
grew in intensity-in some areas the Jap-
anese needed eighty soldiers to guard a 
single mile of rail line--they resorted to 
violent countermeasures: burning whole 
villages, and either shooting the inhabitants 
or transporting them to "safer" areas. But 
this policy backfired; the Communists, 
who had always used their regular forces 
also as an educated vanguard, setting up 
schools and politically indoctrinating the 
villages, found that Japanese atrocities 
made the peasants more, not less, respon-
sive to their message. 

It was in this shifting, bitter violent war 
that Bethune had to develop some kind of 
a hospital system. He had a staff of five 
Chinese doctors, and no other skilled 
assistance at all, to serve several hundred 
square miles of mountainous country and 
over one hundred thousand regular and 
irregular troops. His solution was to attack 
all problems simultaneously: he cleaned up 
and reorganized the existing base "hos-
pitals" (which were usually long-aban-
doned temples with no facilities of any 
kind); he taught orderlies the basic prin-
ciples of hospital hygiene and application 
of field dressings; showed villagers how to 
make splints, stretchers and bandages; 
wrote a textbook to be used in nursing and 
medical schools; and by patient and re-
iterated example persuaded the local 
people first to give their blood for emerg-
ency operations and then to form volunteer 
blood donor corps. The exaltation passed, 
to be replaced by a deep and simple satis-
faction: "I am tired, but I don't think I 
have been so happy for a long time. I am 
content. I am doing what I want to do. 
And see what my riches consist of! I have 
vital work that occupies every moment of 
my time. I am needed. More than that-
to satisfy my bourgeois vanity-the need 
for me is expressed." 

As soon as the base hospital was in rea-
sonable running order Bethune was off to 
the battle zones, to implement his plan for 
mobile field-hospitals. For the last year of 
his life, from October 1938 until Novem-
ber 1939, he was to follow the ever-mobile 
Communist armies as they jabbed at the 
Japanese strong points and communica-
tions, then retreated before the inevitable 
Japanese counterattacks. 

Bethune's new watchword was "Doc-
tors: Go to the wounded. Don't wait for 
the wounded to come to you." To accomp-
lish this goal, he developed a miniature 
unit in which everything was planned to 
the last detail. Bethune and his orderlies 
traveled on horseback, and two mules car-
ried all the necessities for handling one 
hundred patients at a time and equipping 
an operating room, a dressing station and 
a drug room: splints, bandages, surgical 
instruments, disinfectants and chloroform. 
The operating theater was any weather-
proof building near the battle zone-often 
within three miles of the firing line; natur-
ally the setup was crude, but it was better 
than anything that had existed previously. 
When anaesthetic ran out, as it frequently 
did, operations and amputations were 
carried on without it. If the Japanese 
approached the mobile station and could 
not be stopped by local troops, Bethune 
and his staff were ready to move everything 
at ten minutes' notice and ride to safety. 
The non-walking wounded had to be left 
hidden in the villages. 

T he work was unceasing. Bethune him-
self regularly put in an eighteen-hour-day, 
' and drove his staff ruthlessly, insisting the 
while on the highest technical standards 
conceivable in the circumstances. When 
the 359th Brigade of the Eighth Route 
Army attacked a Japanese column on the 
road from Kwangling to Lingkiu in the 
mountainous northeastern corner of 
Shansi, Bethune, who had ridden seventy-Â· 
five miles to the scene, performed seventy-
one minor and major operations in forty 
hours. In early March 1939, he treated 115 
casualties in a sixty-nine-hour stretch. 

When he had spare moments, he wrote of 
his experiences in a savage, lyrical prose: 
Old filthy bandages stuck to the skin with 
blood glue. Careful. Better moisten first. 
Through the thigh. Pick the leg up. Why, it's 
like a bag, a long, loose, red stocking. What 
kind of stocking? A Christmas stocking. 
Where's that fine, strong rod of bone now? In 
a dozen pieces. Pick them out with your fin-
hers; white as dog's teeth, sharp and jagged. 
Now feel. Any more left? Yes, here. All? Yes, 
no, here's another piece. Is this muscle dead? 
Pinch it. Yes, it's dead. Cut it out. How can 
that heal? How can those muscles, once so 
strong, now so torn, so devastated, so ruined, 
resume their proud tension? Pull, relax. Pull, 
relax. What fun it was! Now that is finished. 
Now that's done. Now we are destroyed. Now 
what will we do with ourselves? 

In the course of the year 1939 Norman 
Bethune systematically worked himself to 
death. The legends around his name multi-
plied in the villages and mountains of 
northeast China; his name was invoked as 
a battle cry; as the Communist government 
in Yenan strengthened its organizational 
structure in Shensi and extended its control 
over the newly mobilized peasantry, 
Bethune received ever stronger backing 
and popular support, but his work in-
creased proportionately. At the age of 
forty-nine he looked seventy: white-haired, 
flesh sunken, teeth ruined. He had spells of 
dizziness. He became deaf in one ear. But 
if depression was there, he masked it total-
ly. Only occasionally did he even express 
nostalgia for his past life, his former 
friends. "Are books still being written?" 
he asked in a letter to Canada. "Is music 
still being played? Do you dance, drink 
beer, look at pictures? What do clean 
sheets feel like in a soft bed? Do women 
still love to be loved?" 

In October he was given the chance to go 
back to the United States and Canada on 
a fund-raising trip, to buy desperately 
needed medical supplies. He passed the op-
portunity by and went instead to Laiyuan 
in west Hopei, where the Japanese had 
mounted a strong new attack. In early No-
vember he slashed his finger during a hur-
ried operation while the Japanese were 
moving in on his unit. His unit escaped, 
but in the harried days that followed he 
neglected to treat the finger, which grew 
seriously infected. He insisted on continu-
ing to operate on Chinese troops, as his 
own health weakened. His arm swelled, 
and he drily diagnosed septicemia. "I am 
fatally ill. I am going to die," he told Gen-
eral Nieh in a brief Jetter that was also his 
last will and testament. He bequeathed his 
two cots and his English shoes to the Gen-
eral; his riding boots and trousers were 
willed to the local divisional commander. 
His surgical instruments were carefully 
shared between the C hinese doctors with 
whom he had worked. His aides received 
a blanket each. "The last two years," he 
concluded, "have been the most significant, 
the most meaningful years of my life. 
Sometimes it has been lonely, but I have 
found my highest fulfillment here among 
my beloved comrades. I have no strength 
now to write more .... To you and to all 
my comrades, a thousand thanks." On 
November 13, at dawn, Bethune died. 

Bethune was an emotional, irascible, 
talented man. He had incredible self-
discipline, but did not submit to discipline 
imposed by others. He had drawn strength 
from the comradeship of communism but 
it is unlikely that he would have made a 
good Communist, even though he bad a 
clear enough view of the capitalist enemy, 
as can be seen from the questions he asked 
himself in the Chinese winter, amid the 
smells of blood and chloroform: 

What do these enemies of the human race look 
like? Do they wear on their foreheads a sign 
so that they may be told, shunned and con-
demned as criminals? No. On the contrary, 
they are the respectable ones. They are hon-
ored. They call, and are called, gentlemen. 
What a travesty on the name! Gentlemen! 
They are the pillars of the State, of the church, 
of society. They support private and public 
charity out of the excess of their wealth. They 
endow institutions. In their private lives they 
are kind and considerate. They obey the law, 
their law, the law of property. But there is one 
sign by which these gentle gunmen can be 
told. Threaten a reduction on the profit of 
their money and the beast in them awakes 
with a snarl. They become as ruthless as sav-
ages, brutal as madmen, remorseless as exe-
cutioners. Such men as these must perish if 
the human race is to continue. There can be 
no permanent peace in the world while they 
live. Such an organization of human society 
as permits them to exist must be abolished. 
These men make the wounds. 

Bethune's experiences had given him the 
right to dream of a world without wounds, 
though he was not concerned with tb.e de-
tails of how such a world would be at-
tained. The Chinese might have an answer 
and that was sufficient. In the meantime 
there were more than enough wounds to 
keep a thousand Bethunes occupied, and 
an endless succession of children waiting 
in the wings to be wounded in their turn. 
Certainly he had no expectation of seeing 
that world himself; he wooed death tena-
ciously, although his work was barely 
begun. The patterns of his life, and the 
manner of his leaving it, show that 
Bethune did not simply go to China to save 
wounded soldiers who would otherwise 
have died, nor even to be in the forefront 
of the world struggle against fascism or 
capitalism. He went to China to expiate the 
sins of his generation, to purge himself of 
the apathy and callousness and pursuit of 
profit he believed had rotted his civiliza-
tion. His technical brilliance was the entry 
card into a society that would otherwise 
have rejected him. No Jess than other 
Western advisers he used the Chinese for 
his own ends and was in turn used by them. 
He differed from all others, however, in 
that he used the Chinese to attain a mean-
ingful death. 

In the same hut in Shansi, where he cried 
out at those who made wounds, he also 
wrote: "How beautiful the body is; how 
perfect its parts; with what precision it 
moves; how obedient; proud and strong. 
How terrible when torn. The little flame 
of life sinks lower and lower, and with a 
flicker goes out. It goes out like a candle 
goes out. Quietly and gently.lt makes its 
protest at extinction, then submits. It has 
its say, then is silent." ~
