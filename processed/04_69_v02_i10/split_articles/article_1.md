No one these days is very happy with the 
Yale Daily News. This goes far beyond . 
immature, petty jealousies between campus 
organizations, for many of my friends 
who are running the News express the 
same concern-that something is not work-
ing right. So busy are they printing sup-
plements, course critiques and advertising 
brochures that they seem to take pride in 
doing everything but putting out a respon-
sible, hard-hitting daily. And what should 
be the focal point of that organization 
suffers at the expense of numerous tem-
porary projects. 


The Summer High School crisis is a 
good example. After three months of re-
search on the subject, our Associate Editor 
Paul Goldberger found that the News, des-
perate for an issue on which to attack the 
administration, had come up with a story 
that abdicated aU responsibility for fac-
tual reporting. We have been working 
three months on this one story in order to 
present a responsible account of what 
really happened. The incestuous relations 
between a reporter of the News and the 
people he was writing about reached an 
ugly climax this past weekend. When a 
copy of our story was pirated to that re-
porter, his first action was to relay all the 
information to those who can only be 
called his clients. That the News can alJow 
its reporters to stoop to such depths of 
journalistic immorality and at the same 
time presume to editorialize about the 
rightness or wrongness of things seems 
somewhat paradoxical. If the News has 
not used the knowledge of our story for 
some biased coverage by the time this issue 
appears, it will be exercising a responsible 
restraint for which it has not been known 
in the past.

April 16, 1969

It rained here this afternoon-after a week 
of joyful spring weather-for the first time 
since the bust last Thursday morning. 


Driven away along with the sun was a ten-
sion and anxiety that was relentlessly ex-
hausting both emotionally and physically. 


Gone-for the time being, at least-were the 
chanting pickets, angry speakers, the litera-
ture tables and TV cameras. All that re-
mained were a few isolated groups and a 
warm spring rain. 


The last week, of course, had been very 
different: milling crowds, urgent issues, 
expectation and excitement-"a carnival 
atmosphere in historic Harvard Yard"-to 
join two favorite phrases of the press. The 
press?-they are already taken for granted, 
and it is an isolated few that haven't been 
on TV or interviewed by at least one of the 
four New York Times correspondents. A 
picture of my roommate handing a red 
strike armband to Nathan Pusey was on 
the front page of the Globe, but did you 
see whose picture was in Time this week? 


Most of all, I guess I'm just tired: tired 
of the stupidity of the Administration, 
tired of the demagoguery of SDS, tired of 
the moderates' bickering, tired of points o{ 
order, non-negotiable demands, ultimata, 
colloquia, the decision-making process, 
ROTC, expansionism, concern, activism, 
people ... and spring vacation only ended 
last week. 


It is difficult to be certain about anything 
except your uncertainty here anymore; 
emotions are continually changing and 
with the same inevitability as the mimeo-
graph machine. "Follow your emotions" 
is the new philosophy of crisis as you fluc-
tuate wildly between cool reason and com-
promise and irreconcilable hatred. Six days 
have passed since the bust, and only the 
deep ruts encircling University HaU-left 
by the buses which carried the State Police 
-serve as a reminder of how this aU started. 


It's already difficult to remember the night 
you spent "on the steps,'' the alarm, some 
shouting and then the long line of baby-
blue police helmets moving unimpeded to 
break up quickly and efficiently the token 
resistance. And then all you could do was 
run and shout, surging forward against a 
. wall of cops until one broke and chased 
yoq, clubbing whoever happened to be in 
the way. There was no sign of the worker-
student alliance in these men's faces as 
they dragged the occupiers into their buses 
and paddy wagons and then slowly began 
to cordon off the Yard. 


Superficially, I guess it seemed like Chi-
cago all over again, but in a way it was 
something very different and far more dis-
turbing. This wasn't the personal fiefdom 
of a political boss or a hostile city that 
claimed to be the hog butcher of the world, 
and it was not the climax of a long cam-
paign: this was the college you had chosen 
to attend; those blood-stained steps led to 
the library in which you were supposed to 
seek knowledge. "What were you doing 
.there?" a cop would later ask a kid whose 
camera had been smashed. "I live there,'' 
he replied. That's what made it so much 
more frightening. 


Later, after the cops had withdrawn, 
seven hundred of us drifted towards 
Widener steps, where a microphone had 
been set up. The first speaker gets up to 
speak-he is a leader of SDS. "Now let's go 
to Pusey's house-with rocks" he says, and 
suddenly you come down very bard and 
very fast. The meeting degenerates into a 
shoving and shouting match as the SDS 
leadership desperately tries to hold the 
crowd together and consolidate its support. 


But nothing can be decided upon; SDS has 
seemingly lost its chance, and the meeting 
breaks up after agreeing to meet again at 
a "convocation" called by various student 
government organizations for 10 A.M. in 
Memorial Church. 


The success of that four-hour meeting in 
forestalling an SDS takeover seemed to 
indicate that the usual scenario of radicali-
zation had not really taken place. This was 
a hopeful sign since the inability of the so-
calJed "moderate" students and faculty in 
similar situations at Berkeley, Columbia 
and San Francisco State to establish a posi-
tion independent from both the administra-
tion and the radicals is commonly viewed 
as a principal cause for the bitter division 
and polarization which continue to exist. 


Harvard had traditionally resisted this 
polarization, mainly because, as Nathan 
Glazer bas said, "People seem to have con-
fidence in this place (The New York Times, 
April 13). Skillful in the art of cooperation 
and upstaging, Harvard has made such 
progress that Time Magazine was moved 
to gurgle with admiration a month ago: 
"As usual ... Harvard seems to be out-
doing the rest-or trying awfully hard. The 
nation's oldest university has gone hip, and 
no one is yet sure where the limits may lie." 


But the situation here has proved once 
again how difficult it is to organize people 
around a middle course. There was no 
existing organization with any real support 
since the three student government organi-
zations are by and large out of touch with 
anyone except student-government types. 


Perhaps the only organization that might 
have galvanized politically active liberals 
was the Young Democrats, the leader in 
last year's McCarthy campaign and at one 
point the largest campus organization. But 
Chicago, Nixon and a practically non-
existent leadership made the Young Dems 
an organization in name only, and the new, 
energetic slate of officers elected in Feb-
ruary had only begun to reorganize when 
the University Hall occupation took place. 


From the time of the Memorial Church 
meeting until the mass meeting in Soldiers 
Field four days later, an attempt was made 
to establish some sort of a moderate alter-
native. From the beginning, however, there 
was trouble because no provision had been 
made at the Church meeting for any sort 
of leadership. One person did emerge, 
however, as a de facto leader, and that was 
Ken Glazier, a senior and former Chair-
man of the Student Faculty Advisory 
Council, who, as chairman of the Memori-
al Church meeting, had done a remarkable 
job controlling a somewhat riotous gather-
ing. But other than Glazier, who had not 
been elected by any committee or meeting, 
the leadership of the "Mem Church 
Group,'' as it soon began to be called, 
changed every time you went into the Weld 
Common Room where it was based. 


In sharp contrast to the chaos in Weld 
was the SDS headquarters in the phi-
losophy department offices on the third 
floor of Emerson Hall. Scrupulously ad-
hering to democratic procedures, SDS held 
an open meeting at which 800 people chose 
between eighty-one candidates to elect a 
fifteen-man strike steering committee. All 
decisions made by this committee (all of 
whose meetings are open) are subject to the 
approval of the regular meetings of those 
who support their eight demands. From 
red fists silk-screened on T-shirts to the 
daily publishing of Old Mole strike specials 
to the endless "colloquia" and leaflets, 
their organization has shown itself to be 
incredibly enthusiastic, hard working and 
imaginative. It is hard not to be affected 
by their camaraderie and fervor, and it is 
only when they move outside of their own 
group that the dangerous anti-libertarian-
ism of their moral absolutism becomes 
apparent. 


As of today, however, SDS is clearly the 
only group capable of commanding wide-
spread support. The Mem Church Group 
announced its dissolution at the Soldiers 
Field meeting on Monday after having 
made little attempt to mobilize the mod-
erates. No group has made any attempt to 
take their place; and SDS for the most 
part has moved into a vacuum. The ad-
ministration has been unwilling to make 
any real concessions and bas made the 
moderate position an even more difficult 
one. A majority of students seem to be 
willing to accept the proposals passed by
