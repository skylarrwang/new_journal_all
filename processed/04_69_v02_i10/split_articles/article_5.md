"We're going to call it School One," says 
Larry Paros, and his eyes gleam and his 
hands move. "It will be School One be-
cause it wiJl be the first of its kind. It will 
be free from the bonds of traditional edu-
cation. It will be the laboratory school 
we've tried to get all these years. It will be 
followed, "-and here his voice builds up-
"it will be followed by School Two, and 
Three, and Four .... " 

Lawrence Paros is determined to create 
this. school. He wants it because he con-
siders himself a fine and progressive 
educator, but also because he needs a job. 
He will be out of work on June 30 when 
his contract as Director of the Yale Sum-
mer High School runs out. 

Yale's decision not to renew that coo-
tract set off a winter-long controversy 
about the University's basic educational 
philosophy. But the reasons Yale fired 
Larry Paros have little to do with the 
Singer Report or Yale's supposed racist 
inclinations. They have a lot to do with 
Larry Paros himself, who has spent most 
of his time since the November day he 
learned about his dismissal dreaming 
about School One and preparing an elab-
orate defense that has thus far involved 
personal attacks on members of the Sum-
mer High School administration, a Her-
culean 350-page report prepared entirely 
at Yale's expense, and the aid and comfort 
of the Yale Daily News. 

It all began back last spring when Paros 
unveiled the new core curriculum for 
1968, which was to be his second year as 
Director of the Summer High School. The 
basis for study was race, and relevant 
literary, philosophical and historical ma-
terials were to be used. Paros was anxious 
to increase the program's appeal to under-
privileged students. He felt few qualms 
about accepting inner-city students with 
severe problems of emotional adjustment 
to Yale and college life, confident thauhe 
core curriculum theme would prevent any 
difficulties. Indeed, Paros was so con-
cerned about the inclusion of "alienated" 
youth that, without authority from the 
Yale administration, he accepted thirty 
students more than the program had been 
designed for-thus setting the stage for a 
Yale Summer High School fiscal crisis that 
was to reach monumental proportions 
later in the summer. 

The students arrived in late June and the 
core curriculum, along with courses in 
composition, math seminar electives, arts 
workshops and athletic activities, went 
into effect. Everything looked tine until 
tutors began to realize that students were 
not regularly attending classes. As atten-
dance dropped, morale also began to falter, 
and the "relevant" core curriculum began 
to seem strangely out of place in a school 
troubled with increasingly severe discip-
linary and educational problems. The 
emphasis on race had partially backfired: 
"A white man will not make a good black 
militant, like so many whites have tried 
to do at Yale this summer," said one 
black student. 

The summer ended on an uncertain 
note. Many students, especially those who 
were returning after more traditional 
YSHS summers, hated it; others called it 
the greatest experience of their lives. Fac-
ulty, too, were divided: some staff members 
viewed Paros as the unsung genius of 
twentieth-century education, while others 
saw him as the direct cause of the Summer 
High School's downfall. 

Paros admits that he was controversial. 
Yet he has managed to manipulate the 
facts so that the heart of the controversy 
has never come to light. He was in fact 
discharged not because the University was 
adopting the Singer Report's recommenda-
tion that the Summer High become a 
funnel of blacks into Yale, but because the 
1968 session was, from the point of view 
of its administration, a failure. Though the 
University does agree with many of the 
Singer recommendations (for example, the 
altogether reasonable position that the 
Summer High School should not simply 
duplicate the Upward Bound program), 
Paros was fired more because of his in-
ability to deal with "alienated" students 
than because he preferred them to those 
with "college potential." 

D. Peter Ciochetto, Director of Com-
position and a four-year YSHS veteran, 
recalls, "Discipline last summer was im-
possible. There are too many incidents to 
list: destruction of property, disregard of 
curfews and so on. Larry Paros totally 
abdicated his authority; he didn't like to 
be an administrator, so he wasn't one." 

Paros could probably neither answer 
yes or no to the charge of being lax; his 
bead was all too often in the clouds last 
summer. He preferred to think of dis-
cipline in terms of the abstract; to him 
there were only vague realities of drug, 
sexual and theft problems in the Summer 
High School. In the Director's Report-
Paras's 350-page account of the program 
-he writes in theoretical terms: "We con-
ceived the purpose of education to be the 
facilitation of self control, a turning on 
from the inside through the mediation of 
sympathetic structures, ideas and persons." 

Such language sounds impressive-until 
the cold facts of excessive drug use, an 
alleged rape case and Â·a tutor whose room 
was ransacked by students are added to the 
saga of the summer. 

Many of the students enjoyed the free 
atmosphere: "This program was a wonder-
ful experience for me and I will never for-
get it. Larry Paros is a real soul brother," 
said one girl. She was not alone in her 
admiration of the Director. Edgar F. 
Beckham, Wesleyan University professor 
who spent two and one half days at Yale 
evaluating the program for Educational 
Associates Incorporated, wrote in a letter 
toParos: 

The thing that struck me most about the Yale 
Summer High School was the thoughtfulness 
and depth of the theoretical design .... The 
intellectual implications of the core course 
bad been worked out in great detail, and even 
the behavior of students had been antici-
pated, interpreted and worked into a concep-
tual framework. In short, I thought the pro-
gram was extremely well conceived. 

But the feeling among more than a few 
faculty members, who were on campus for 
more than Beckham's two and a half days, 
was that the program seriously lacked di-
rection. Michael Frank, a staff tutor, noted, 
"I am unable to say whether or not YSHS 
'68 has been successful because I stiJl don't 
know what our goals are . ... There is a 
fundamental ambivalence." 

Educationally, the 1968 session was in 
fact an attempt to reconcile Paros's per-
sonal preference foJ;: a laissez-faire ad-
ministration with a highly demanding core 
curriculum-a course plan challenging 
enough for college-bound students, let 
alone for the students from less privileged 
backgrounds who Paros insisted were the 
Summer High School's raison d' etre. It is 
hardly surprising that there emerged a 
"fundamental ambivalence." 

John Hildebidle, a Harvard graduate 
student who served as Head Tutor, ob-
served this about the discipline problem: 

The question is basically: Who is running 
the school? The Director, the students, or no 
one? This year the theory claimed that the 
Director was in charge; the Director tried to 
play the coy mistress, making illusory gestures 
toward a "democracy"; that in fact amounted 
to a dictatorship by students. The practice 
and experience of this summer has brought 
me to the conclusion that no one was "run-
ning" or directing the program in any useful, 
productive, intelligent sense .... We seem 
willing to ignore the fact that a student who 
never goes to class, who takes five days off 
illegally, who shoots heroin, may just have 
a deleterious effect on other students .... 
We must realize that we are not God's great 
green educational heaven .... 

Paros never replied directly to Hildebidle 
or Frank, for the tutors' comments were 
made in an anthology of faculty evalua-
tions prepared at the summer's end. Tra-
ditionally, the anthology is distributed to 
the Administrative Board of the Summer 
High School and becomes an important 
factor in the review of the year; this time, 
however, Paros withheld copies of the 
critical report. Members of the Board and 
staff writers of the Yale Daily News, who 
thought they were getting the "full story," 
were never even made aware of the anthol-
ogy's existence. 

At the summer's end not only was the 
Summer High School at an educational 
impasse; its finances were also in crisis. 
Paros claims that Joel L. Fleishman, As-
sociate Provost for Urban Studies and 
Programs and YSHS's Director during 
J 965-66, failed to fulfill a pledge to raise 
$25,000 in extra funds. Fleishman did 
raise $19,600, thus falling only $5,400 
short of his promise. But Paros insists that 
Fleishman's pledge was for $25,000 more 
than the $19,600 Fleishman raised. 

Had the $25,000 been raised, it still 
would not have cleared the program's 
deficit, despite Paros's claims. Not only did 
Paros accept thirty students more than the 
program could easily accommodate; he 
also failed to budget for overhead, stating 
that he was never "told" to do so. The 
University Comptroller's Office, however, 
has sent Paros official financial statements 
which include overhead figures for every 
month since he assumed the directorship 
of the Summer High School-statements 
which, it appears, Paros never read. 

Estimates of the deficit now range as 
high as $100,000.lt is clear that the Uni-
versity did commit one clerical error, but 
at least three-quarters of the deficit still 
stems from Paros's failure to estimate the 
summer's costs properly. The situation has 
become so confused that Yale bas called 
in outside auditors to review the books. 

The combination of YSHS's financial 
woes and its educational crisis was the 
real reason for Yale's decision to dis-
charge Paros. Unfortunately, the Yale
