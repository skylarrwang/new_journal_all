"Is this muscle dead? Pinch it. Yes, it's dead. 
Cut it out.": Norman Bethune in Mao's China.


In December 1938 the Canadian doctor 
Norman Bethune was serving with ele-
ments of the Communist Chinese Army 
behind the Japanese lines in north China. 
In the cold clear hours of early morning, 
after working all day and all night, be 
marshaled his thoughts on disease and 
death:


Gangrene is a cunning, creeping fellow. Is 
this one alive? Yes, be lives. Technically 
speaking, he is alive. Give him saline intra-
venously. Perhaps the innumerable, tiny cells 
of his body will remember. They may re-
member the hot, salty sea, their ancestral 
home, their first food. With the memory of a 
million years, they may remember other tides, 
other oceans and life being born of the sea 
and sun. It may make them raise their tired 
little heads, drink deep and struggle back into 
life again. It may do that. 


And this one. Will he run along the road 
beside his mule at another harvest, with cries 
of pleasure and happiness? No, that one will 
never run again. How can you run with one 
leg? What will he do? Why, he'll sit and 
watch other boys run. What will he think? 
He'll think what you and I would think. 
What's the good of pity? Don't pity him! Pity 
would diminish his sacrifice. He did this for 
the defense of China. Help him. Lift him off 
the table. Carry him in your arms. Why, he's 
light as a child! Yes, your child, my child. 


At this time, Norman Bethune was forty-
eight years old and intimately acquainted 
with death. He had served with theCa-
nadian Army in the First World War as 
a stretcher-bearer and been seriously 
wounded. After studying medicine in 
Canada and Europe, and leading a flam-
boyant and extravagant life, he finally set 
up in private practice in Detroit, only to 
find that he had contracted virulent tuber-
culosis. He was not expected to live; on the 
walls of his sanatorium room he painted 
himself clasped in the arms of the Angel 
of Death, with the legend: "My little act is 
over, and the tiresome play is done." If 
he did nothing, he estimated, having care-
fully followed the track of his disease, he 
would be dead in 1932. "Contemplation," 
he wrote to his ex-wife, "becomes one's 
special form of action, and no one here 
can escape the changes, the discoveries, the 
greater self-knowledge that are inevitably 
the product of such enforced contem-
plation." For Bethune, self-knowledge 
brought desire to live. He insisted that he 
be used as a guinea pig in the newly de-
veloping compression treatment for 
tubercular patients known as "artificial 
pneumothorax." The treatment was suc-
cessful, and on recovery Bethune joined 
the faculty of medicine at McGill Univer-
sity as a specialist in thoracic surgery. 


His self-knowledge had brought him 
renewed life; the intellectual discoveries 
that be had made profoundly altered the 
content of that life. He began to question 
the ethics of the medical profession, where 
doctors grew rich while the myriad poor 
died of disease and undernourishment 
in the slums that the Depression had 
spawned. "There is a rich man's tuber-
culosis and poor man's tuberculosis," be 
reflected. "The rich man recovers and the

doing research on the K'ang Hsi Emperor. 
poor man dies. This succinctly expresses 
the close embrace of economics and pa-
thology." He treated the poor free, began 
to examine systems of socialized medicine 
and to argue for them in public, learned 
to admire the achievements of the Russian 
Revolution: "Creation is not and never bas 
been a genteel gesture. It is rude, violent 
and revolutionary." In 1936 be was invited 
by the Committee to Aid Spanish De-
mocracy to lead a Canadian medical unit 
to Madrid, to help the Loyalists in their 
fight with Franco. The invitation confused 
and excited him. "Go to Spain? Last week 
I had to decide whether to operate on my 
child. Now I have to decide whether I go 
to Spain. I am surprised, honored-and 
perplexed. Am I the right person? Am I 
ready? Yesterday's answers seem to pre-
pare new questions for today. And tomor-
row-what? The times impose cruel and 
irreversible decisions on us!" 


Bethune reached Madrid in November 
1936. He stayed there several months, 
developing mobile blood transfusion units 
that could operate near the front line, and 
establishing the necessary blood banks to 
back them up. He saw, once again, hun-
dreds of men dying in action and the 
civilian refugees dying on the roadside. 
His anger with the Western democracies 
that stood aside while the Fascist armies 
triumphed grew even stronger. In the s~Â­
mer of 1937 he returned to Canada on a 
fund-raising mission and joined the Com-
munist Party. The newspapers were full 
of China. J:le could not ignore it. "I refuse 
to live in a world that spawns murder and 
corruption without raising my band against 
them. I refuse to condone, by passivity, 
or by default, the wars which greedy men 
make against others .... Spain and China 
are part of the same battle. I am going to 
China because I feel that is where the need 
is greatest; that is where I can be most 
useful." In January of 1938 he was in 
Hankow, on the YangtZe, conferring with 
Nationalist Chinese officials; by early 
March he was at Hotsin in western Shansi 
province, treating the demoralized troops 
of the war load Yen Hsi-shan: he found no 
serious cases, and was informed that this 
was because all the seriously wounded men 
had died. By the end of March he had 
crossed the Yellow. River with a small 
Communist supply team and arrived in 
Yen an. 


Yenan was Mao Tse-tung's base, the 
center of the Chinese Communist move-
ment. After the disasters of 1927, the 
Communists had either gone underground 
in the cities, or retreated to poverty-
stricken areas of the countryside, where 
they had established provisional "Soviet" 
governments. In the early thirties Mao had 
created such a government in the south-
eastern province of Kiangsi, but the un-
remitting attacks of Chiang Kai-shek, 
directed by German military advisers, had 
finally forced the Communists to retreat on 
the Long March to the northwest. It was 
on this march, in early 1935, that Mao 
had gained control of the party, and it was 
in Yenan that Mao had regrouped the scat-
tered and dispirited Communist forces. 


As his rallying cry, Mao bad adopted the 
potent slogan of "Unify China to resist 
the Japanese." Chiang Kai-shek had found 
it increasingly difficult to group his fol-
lowers round the anti-Communist cause 
while the Japanese were threatening 
China's very existence, and by mid-1937 he 
and the Communists bad once again 
formed a United Front. The Front was 
little more united than it had been in the 
early twenties, but at least a semblance of
