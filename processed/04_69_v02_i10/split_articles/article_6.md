administration decided last fall to "regu-
larize" summer program appointments, 
and just before his dismissal Paros received 
notification of the advancement of his 
contract termination from September, 
1969 to June, 1969. The resulting con-
fusion, plus the concurrent issuing of the 
Singer Report, led Paros to charge that it 
was administrative politicking, rather than 
the Summer High School situation itself, 
that led to his dismissal. 

Not that administrative politicking did 
not exist-it did at several turns in the story. 
But the administration's major offense, its 
failure to make public the full reasons for 
Paros's dismissal, is hardly sufficient to 
shift the burden of blame from Paros. Most 
likely, the administration's motives for 
concealing its reasons ranged from dismay 
at Paro's management of YSHS and a de-
sire to protect his reputation to disagree- . 
ment with his educational philosophy. But 
the administration cannot be blamed for 
not wanting to shift the issue to a debate of 
educational philosophy when it was faced 
with a simple problem of mismanagement. 
Paros claims he never wanted his job back. 
Perhaps not, but he has spent the bulk of 
his time since his dismissal preparing the 
Summer High School's annual Director's 
Report, which he has turned into a 350-
page apologium for himself and his edu-
cational philosophy. Along with one of his 
asso'ciate directors, Jonathan Hall, and 
with the partial help of Associate Director 
Isaac Miller, Paros has added chapter after 
chapter to the report, promising that it 
will be ready "next week" at regular inter-
vals since January. The irony of the 
finished document is that it is not what was 
called for in the first place. Officially, the 
Director's Report should be only a brief 
review of the summer for the use of the 
university administration; this version, 
however, includes quotations from Alice 
in W onder land, exerpts from educational 
journals, SHS student evaluations, the 
financial charges, defenses of Paros's edu-
cational methods, and his proposals for 
restructuring Yale and establishing 
School One. The salaries, secretarial costs 
and photocopy expenses that have gone to 
produce the 350-page white elephant are 
estimated at substantially over ten thou-
sand dollars, all of which Paros is charging 
to the Yale Summer High School. For an 
educator so concerned that the under-
privileged receive a larger share of the pie, 
be has been strikingly lax with education 
funds since his dismissal. 

Paros bad actuaJly been working on the 
Report at the time of his dismissal; it was 
not until he demanded that the University 
reveal its "secret" motives for firing him 
that the controversy broke wide open. 
Paros was told that he had been dismissed 
because of the program's need for a direc-
tor from the Yale faculty, a requirement 
of the Office of Economic Opportunity, 
which heavily funds the program. The 
Singer Report, however, also made the 
recommendation of a faculty director, 
and again the administration's statement 
of fact led to confusion. 

Paros knew a good thing when be saw 
it. He made certain that Alan Boles, then 
chairman of the Yale Daily News, knew 
of the Singer Report and the easy connec-
tion that could be made between its recom-
mendations and his dismissal. A brief 
conversation ensued, and the Daily News 
was firmly ensconced in the Paros camp. 
The first Summer High School story, 
"Singer Report Comes Under Fire," ap-
peared on December 19. 

After Christmas and the January exam 
period, the 1970 editorial board took over 
the reins of the News, and they, too, knew 
a good thing when they saw it. The Daily 
News greeted the second semester with a 
lead story by Douglas Hallett, who has 
since taken charge of the paper's c<Werage 
of the controversy. The story included a 
statement supporting Paros, signed by 25 
of the 42 members of the YSHS faculty. 
But it is questionable whether the signers 
knew what they were signing. Peter 
Ciochetto, listed as a signer, states that 
he was never shown the document. 
"Jonathan Hall telephoned me and asked 
if my name could be used in a statement 
protesting the administration's refusal to 
give Paros reasons for his dismissal," 
Ciochetto states. "I have only now found 
out that it was really an endorsement of 
the way Paros ran the school." 

Paros and HaH deny charges of "con-
spiracy" between themselves and the 
News. But to state that the News's coverage 
has been biased is like saying that Carmen 
Cozza roots for the Bulldogs. "Conspiracy" 
or not, the Daily News and Paros have 
been on the same team since the contro-
versy started. Typical of News stories have 
been features such as "The Singer Report: 
Is Experiment Dead?" which Paros re-
printed in the Director's Report. 

On January 30, Hallett reported in the 
News that President Brewster had told him 
that the report had been endorsed "in 
principle" by the Yale Corporation. 
Brewster later denied the statement. The 
News printed both his denial and Hallett's 
charge that Brewster, by the denial, had 
called Hallett's story of January 30 a lie. 
Indeed, at times the News has become 
more zealous than even Paros and Hall. 
Richard Sewall, Professor of English and 
former chairman of the Administrative 
Board of the Summer High School, has 
been one of the few administration mem-
bers working hard for an amicable settle-
ment of the dispute. Yet, when Sewall 
expressed certain doubts about the 1968 
program, Hallett wrote in his column 
about "an English teacher who waxes elo-
quently about Shakespearean tragedy and 
refuses to face his own tragic cowardice 
in his relationship to the Summer High 
School." 

Throughout, the News has placed em-
phasis on the Singer Report's phrase, 
"Yale is an elitist institution," a somewhat 
siJly but fundamentally innocent state-
ment of irrefutable fact that was unfairly 
interpreted as an all-encompassing pre-
scription for Yale's future. 

But try as it did-and it did-the Daily 
News was unable to drum up significant 
student support for the issue. The nebul-
ous connection between the Singer Report 
and the Summer High School issue kept 
on looking somewhat nebulous, and Hal-
lett's personal attacks added liUle to the 
News's credibility. On March 11, theN ews 
expanded its targets to include Fleishman, 
under whose office the Summer High 
School operates, and Jonathan Fanton, 
coordinator of special education programs, 
stating that the Singer Report wanted not 
blacks as human beings but "mini-Brew-
sters, mini-Fleishmans and mini-Fantons." 

The warm winds of spring brought the 
Daily News's last big blitz. The April 4 
special supplement OQ. the Singer Report 
Â·included the entire text plus several 
columns confirming the News's commit-
ment to the fallacy of the direct ti~in 
between the Report and Paros's dismissal. 
The supplement had been written almost 
two months before its publication. 

Paros and Hall insist that the main issue 
is not the Summer High School itself but 
the administration's refusal to discuss the 
firing at an open hearing. But Paros was 
invited to appear before the Administrative 
Board on two different occasions, both of 
which be refused, stating that the Board's 
"bad faith" made it impossible for him to 
deal with matters "after the fact." 

Only an open hearing would do, Paros 
said, adding that he sees no other way to 
deal with issues in a free university. Paros's 
interest in free dialogue, however, seems 
largely restricted to his own side of the 
story. While not criticizing the News's 
coverage except to state it relied too much 
on the "personal," he reacted to news that 
The New Journal was planning a less fav-
orable view of the Summer High School 
by demanding that he have complete edit-
ing rights. 

The chances of Yale accepting Larry 
Paros's School One proposal, which makes 
up the core of the conclusion of his report, 
are virtually nonexistent. Law School 
faculty member Larry Simon, next year's 
Director, is well into planning for this sum-
mer, and soon Larry Paros, Jonathan Hall 
and "Ike" Miller-who has done most of 
last year's follow-up work while Hall and 
Paros have prepared the report-will all 
be on their way. 

What can be learned from the contro-
versy? The story of Larry Paros's tenure 
at Yale is a sad one. He came in 1967 with 
an outstanding reputation as a creative 
educator in the New Haven school sys-
tem. He planned an exciting program for 
the summer of 1968. But it was impossible 
to reconcile his academically challenging 
curriculum with the sort of students and 
the pseudo-democratic community he in-
sisted on having. Many students profited. 
But many did not. And Paros' financial 
mismanagement cast a further pall on the 
Summer High School's reputation. 

The Yale Summer High School 1968 
represented the failure of a fundamentally 
good idea. But almost as unfortunate is the 
failure of Larry Paros to admit how he 
erred. Driven by a moral self-righteous-
ness, he pieced together a defense that 
resulted in irresponsible acts on the part 
of the university newspaper, injured repu-
tations, and the whittling away of thou-
sands of dollars of potentially constructive 
money for a massive report that totally 
evaded the issue at hand. 

It is clearly 'Jess exciting to see a story 
end with the administration in the right. 
A dashing radical defeating establishment 
bigotry and backwardness and triumphant-
ly leading the forces of progress onward-
that is always much more fun to read 
about. But that's not the way it happened 
here.
