Why the Poets are in the Dark 
"If a democracy is going to work, it means that we've got to have 
an educational system so that a person can at least understand the 
issues, never mind the details. It's up to the members of the public 
to ask the questions and demand answers from the people who are 
supposed to know what the details are. "

The New journal, October 1982 

A few years ago, about this time of year, I sat down with a 
blue book in my hand and tried to figure out how I was go-
ing to spend my semester. One of the considerations that 
swung rather like a pendulum over my head was that, 
because of Yale's distribution requirements, I had to pick a 
course in the sciences, a Group IV. 

Planck's Constant. Avogadro's Number. Gregor Mendel 
and his 100 yellow-green pea plants. I knew I couldn't 
return to the nightmares of high school physics, chemistry 
and biology. But I was reasonably sure that I could enjoy 
science if only it were taught a little differently. I had a 
vague idea that there was more to science than memorizing 
and forgetting certain formulas arrived at centuries ago by 
thoughtful men in their bathtubs. I suspected that what I 
had forced myself to swallow in high school was not science 
at all, but rather a series of unsavory textbook exercises 
calculated to make undecided students, like myself, shy 
away from science altogether. 

It was decided long ago that teachers must present 
science in such a way as to discourage the average student 
from perceiving its relevance to his or her life. And so, in-
stead of reading about the possibilities for organ transplants 
or solar power, we learned about Planck's Constant and the 
displacement that a 200g mass of a certain density makes in 
a glass of water on the moon. Instead of studying the im-
plications of genetic research, we learned how to calculate 
the velocity of an apple dropped from the top of a tree. We 
knew E = mc2 but we weren't sure how that translated into 
Hiroshima. We learned about lipids and lysosomes, but we 
didn't learn about how a small slice of silicon is in the midst 
of building a new society. 

At any rate, there I was with the blue book, and I had to 
decide. I had an option, though. I could pick one of the 
"poet" courses in the sciences, like "Rocks for Jocks," or 
"Earth, Wind and Fire" or "Space, Time and Motion." 
These are the dozen or so courses in biology, astronomy, 
geology, 
physics and engineering that are tailored 
specifically for the humanities major. These are the gee-
whiz stalagmite guts, the ones that people who dread 
science resort to when the gig is up and their time has come 
to take a Group IV. 

There is something inherently condescending about the 
notion of a non-science science course. For a long time I 
think there has been an assumption among science instruc-
tors that their courses must possess a certain air of inac-
cessibility in order to sound legitimate. A history major 
can't just expect to sit down in a classroom and learn 
something about modern science. That is not fair. First, he

has to memorize the Periodic Table and learn to convert 
Celsius to Kelvin with requisite facility. 

Such is the rationale behind the science course for poets. 
It is a watered-down way for the history major to get his 
science and get on with his liberal education with as little 
embarrassment as possible. So three times a week a pro-
fessor comes down from the Hill and walks into Linsley-
Chit with colored chalk and a slideshow, and proceeds to 
teach non-scientific science for an hour. The blue book 
should have read: "This course is not really science, but it's 
the next best thing to being there for those of you who don't 
care to learn, or simply can't learn, what science is really 
about." 

I don't blame anyone but myself for taking one of these 
classes. Still, I think there is something wrong with the way 
science is being taught to "non-science" people. One can 
either take an inordinately difficult course in general 
chemistry or a ridiculously easy course in Comparative 
Health Systems. There needs to be a happy medium. I 
don't see these inadequacies as part of some academic con-
spiracy, but rather as a colqssal oversight on the part of the 
Yale administration. In a world in which science and 
technology are making vast and irreversible changes in 
...., 
society, people who don't intend to spend four years in a 
laboratory must get a handle on what is happening outside. 

There are a number of reasons why there is no happy 
medium in Yale's science courses: the conflict between 
scientific research and teaching, the relative infancy of 
science in academia, the temptation among academic scien-
tists to seek lucrative positions in government and business. 
But for whatever reason, I don't think there has been a 
tremendous amount of effort on the part of the scientific 
community to synthesize and present what has been learn-
ed. And the people who have done this, people like Carl 
Sagan and Stephen Jay Gould, have often been ostracized 
by their colleagues as panderers to the public. 

It is critical to recognize that non-science majors have . 
governed science in the past and probably will continue to 
do so in the future. They are the ones who have traditional-
ly made policy decisions in the United States. Harry 
Truman chose to drop the Bomb, not J. Robert Op-
penheimer. Some high-level bureaucrar-in the Pentagon 
approved the use of Agent Orange in Vietnam, not the 
biologist who created it. 

What happens, then, when our non-science major finds 
himself on the Senate floor debating an appropriations bill 
for a $2 billion particle accelerator in Texas and he doesn't 
understand the first thing about what goes on inside it? 
What happens when the governor of Nebraska has to 
dispose of 2 tons of toxic waste and he's got a dozen experts 
and a dozen different opinions? 

Planck's Constant and Avogadro's Number don't mean 
so much anymore.
