In their forays into the "real world," 
the Whiffenpoofs are a symbol to many 
people of what American college life is 
-or at least was - like. There is certain-
ly more than a touch of calculated 
nostalgia worked into their routines. 
Retired Yale Professor Thomas G. 
Bergin, in an interview last year, called 
them 
representatives 
of "carefree, 
wistful, doomed youth." In the eyes of 
many alumni, the Whiffenpoofs, like the 
senior secret societies, arc one of the last 
remaining holdouts from the days when 
things were done for God, for country, 
and for mother Yale. 
Elitist or 
not, 
WASPish or not, 
nostalgic or not, the Whiffs are in de· 
mand. "People take us very seriously," 
says Rob Carter, the savvy business 
manager of the 1983 group. How ser-
iously? Well, the four-digit price tag 
the Whiffs come with is no joke. "Most 
of the time we tailor our concert fees to 
what is expected of us," Carter ex· 
plains. "We average about $1000 per 
concert- including benefits-and we 
do a lot of those. If you want to work 
that out ... " Carter grins, implying 
that the Whiffs are not doing so badly 
at all. 

"You have to be charming 
on call. Even at the 21 Club, 
that can get to be a drag." 

"Not badly at all" would of course be 
a serious understatement. The Whif-
fenpoofs, Inc. are paid a lot of money. 
They are rumored to have grossed in 
excess of $10,000 for their 4-minute 
appearance on Saturday Night Live 
in the winter of 1981, and at least as 
much for this year's National Reww 
banquet in Washington. They also 
sang the National Anthem at last year's 
Cotton Bowl in Dallas, and made an 
appearance at the Playboy Club in 
Tokyo. And it would be impossible to 
calculate the value of the corporate 
benefits. This summer in Salzburg, 
Austria, a count by the name of 
Weiderdorf threw a special banquet for 
the Whiffenpoofs: J4 tables, each one 
named after a Whiffenpoof, each one 
hosted by a Whiffenpoof. 

And then there are the benefactors. 
Like any solvent corporation in the 
entertainment business, 
the Whiffs 
have a number of private donors who 
help keep the group going- to the tune 
of another six figures a year. It is these 
benefactors who make 
the 
annual 
world tour possible. Understandably, 
the Whiffs refuse to name names. "It 
wouldn't be professional to talk about 
these people," says Carter, with a pro-
tective air. "They clearly want to re-
main anonymous." 

As a 
non-profit corporation, 
Whiffs spend all their money on 
operating expenses. Like the engraved 
business cards, the matching let· 
terhead stationery and the anwering 
service. True, they have to provide 
their own set of tails, but that expense 
is their only personal layout. The 
world tour takes a big bite out of the 
Whiff pocketbook, but there's enough 
left over for a two-week tour of the 
West Coast every winter. Another big 
chunk of their money goes for record-
