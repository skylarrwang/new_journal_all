much of it is really quite artificial and 
tedious. •rve met 70-year-old men for 
whom being a Whiffenpoof was it; says 
1983 pitchpipe David Payne. "That's 
scary." It might seem strange that a 
group that has worked so hard to 
cultivate an image should feel pressured 
by it, but many of the Whiffs will tell 
you that there are definite drawbacks to 
being a valuable social contact. "I 
resented the fact that there were a lot of 
people who nev~r seemed to have time 
for me before I was tapped," remem-
bers Rogers. "All of the sudden, after I 
was tapped, they had time." 

Some of the oldest Whiffenpoof tradi-
tions are taken by many people to be a 
sign of snobbish insularity. After all, 
most of those traditions are closed to the 
outside world, like those of the secret 
societies. For instance, the W hiffenpoofs 
are tapped into nicknames handed down 
through the years. Each member has a 
specific duty to the group, and an ap-
propriate title to go with it. Some of the 
titles are standard: historian, pitch-
pipe, business manager. Others are a 
little more esoteric: the Nadir is the 
one who has to see the bottom of every 
cup drunk at Mory's. The Turkey 
dresses in star-spangled satin tuxes for 
every concert. The Boy Scout makes 
sure that every Whiff is on time for 
whatever's happening. T he Apoth-
ecary 
provides 
well, 
the 
Apothecary provides. 

Of course the oldest Whiffenpoof 
tradition is being an all-male group. And 
on the Yale campus it has become a 
popular sport to speculate on why. The 
fact that the Whiffs remain exclusively 
male has led to all kinds of rumors about 
their sexuality. It's al1 old joke that the 
group consists of the Whiffs and the 
Poofs. But the answer to why the Whif-
fenpoofs don't admit women seems 
simply to be that the sound of the 
group would be irrevocably changed. "If 
women had men's voices, we'd be happy 
to admit 
them," explains Jamie 
Saakvitne, a bass who dropped out of 
school for a year to be a W hiff. Payne 
elaborates on this point: "We have 300 
arrangements collected over 75 years. 
They're all for male voices. We couldn't 
just admit women and sing the same 
songs. We'd have to throw out the entire 
repertoire. Wom en are proud of creat-

ing their own traditions, and they should 
be," says Payne, referring to Yale's two-
year-old senior women's singing gt:aup, 
Whim 'n' Rhythm. "Then, too. we don't 
want to be another Red, Hot and Blue. 
They're a tough act to follow. They get 
the best men-and the best women-on 
campus. They're terribly professional, 
terribly efficient." 

It seems patronizing for a Whiffen-
poof to talk about the "efficiency" of 
another singing group. Yet part of the 
Whiffenpoof success story, according to 
a former Whim, is that for all their 
slick professionalism they have never 
lost their personal touch. "They're just 
incredibly nice people," she says. "The 
way they reach out to others through 
their music is something no other 
group here has ever come close to." 

Music after all, is the primary reason 
the Whiffenpoofs still exist. Whiffenpoof 
performances have a style all their 
own- they mix college-kid humor and 
intricate harmonization with a 
gentlemanly ease that's hard to find at 
Yale anymore. Whiffenpoof concerts, 
no matter how difficult, no matter how 
contrived, always look spontaneous. "It's 
pretty damn hard to look like a carefree 
college senior when it's your seventh 
concert of the week, you've got two 
papers overdue, your girlfriend 
is 
threatening to leave you, and you've got 
bronchitis," says Whiffenpoof John 
Swing. 

But that impression of adolescent 
complacency must be maintained. It is 
about all that keeps this lingering 
anachronism in business. But if they can 
remain as successful as they have been 
in the marketing of old traditions, it's a 
safe bet that on their 150th Anniversary, 
the Whiffenpoofs, Inc. will still be sitting 
down to state dinners somewhere in the 
Orient or bringing nostalgic professors 
and sentimental alumni to tears on Mon-
day nights with those old familiar lines. 
To the tAbles down at Mary's 
To the p!oce where Louis dweUs 
To the dear old Temple bar we love so well 
Sing the Whi.ffenpoofs assembled, with 
their glasses raised on high 
And the magic of their singing casts a spell. 
It's amazing what white tie and tails will 
do for your image .
