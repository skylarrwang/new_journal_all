**Title: Between the Vines A Day in the Life of the Weekly Bulletin and Calendar**
**Author: David Kipen**
**Page number(s): 6-7**

Everybody has a favorite image for
what makes Yale Yale. For some, it's
the way the Old Campus bleeds
together on foggy nights and Bladder-
ball afternoons.

For brochure
photographers,
it's an ethnically
diverse study session in Branford
Courtyard. For President Giamatti,
it's whatever group he happens to be
addressing while passing the beanie.
But for me, there can only be one
magical microcosm capable of sum-
moning the distinctive sigh that says:
"This, (and for some, the quintessence
of the place abides in this very pause) is
Yale."


I am referring to the Weekly Bulletin
and Calendar, that infallible authority
on all things Yale. WB&C's calendar
sprouting each Monday from our din-
ing hall tables, presents a centerfold
more
tantalizing than any other
periodical not containing E-Z-Out
staples.

The Calendar provides a liturgy for
the religious experience that is an Eli
education. One typical calendar, that
of 5/23-5/29, lists everything from
neuroscience seminars ("Developmen-
tal Shifting of Retinal Terminals and
Its Relationship to Synaptic Patterning
in the Frog Tectum") to endorrinology
lectures ("The Islets of Langerhans as a
Model for Cell Interactions and Pro-
tein Secretion") to "Unfriendly Flora
and Fauna."

Where else but at Yale could Pro-
fessor Ellen Messer strike "Blows
Against Indigestion: Pharmacological
and Symbolic Aspects of Medicinal
Plants in Mitla, Oaxaca, Mexico?"
Where else could Dr. Edward Krug
draw his ominous correlations between
"Acid Rain and Sportfishing?" Where
else could Dr. Daniel Patrisso conduct
his much beloved "Urology Grand
Rounds?"

Where also, besides Yale, could a
writer take it into his head to spend a
day precisely as the Calendar suggests
that such a day be spent? To his
dismay, not even at Yale can this be
done, for many of the listings are
scheduled at the same time. For exam-
ple, were someone inexplicably smit-
ten with an interest in the Physics Club
lecture "Magnetic Moments of the
Charged Hyperons," he would in all
likelihood have to forgo the Q-and-A
period for "Apartment Hunting in
New York City." Then, after but a few
"Magnetic Moments," he must fly off
to a Medical Club lecture on "The
Discovery of Insulin: What Really
Happened." There is, unfortunately,
no lecture to instruct the dilettante
about how to be in three places at once.

What's
a
diabetic
physicist from
Manhattan to do?

He is, alas, to reconcile himself to
the fact that he cannot possibly do
everything on a given day. But he may
be consoled with the assurance that he
can easily do more than any sane per-
son could ever possibly want to do. It
was with the latter goal in mind that I
awoke one morning recently and set
out for a journey on the calendar trail
... 8:15: IEEE meeting entitled "A
Microprocessor-based Technique for
the Detection of Venous Air Embolism
During Neurosurgery." Not only did I
not know what the words in the title
meant, I didn't even know what IEEE
stood for. I could only assume that the
lecturer asked his wife what he ought to
call this new meeting series he was put-
ting together and she asked him what
kind of things they'd be meeting to
discuss and he said, oh, venous air em-
bolisms and stuff, and she said,
"IEEE!"

Anyway, this morning's speaker, a
Mr. Gilman, ticked me off right away
by talking about his experiments on
20-kilogram dogs. I ask you, what sort
of person weighs a perfectly normal.
