"Who cares about Botticelli or Bach," 
wrote a Newsweek reader in response to 
a commentary defending a liberal arts 
education, "when millions of people 
around the world are dying of hunger 
and disease? Instead of spending years 
writing articles only they can under-
stand, why don't these 'scholars' devote 
their time to finding ways of curing 
cancer and abolishing world hunger?" 

Those at Yale who consider them-
selves liberals should take a moment to 
pause and reflect upon the university 
which surrounds and sustains them. 

This year, some $60 million will be 
spent to house and provide 5,000 Yale 
undergraduates with a "liberal educa-
tion" which, in the words of President 
Giamatti, "seeks no rewards beyond it-
self." They will be housed, fed and 
taught at one of the most elite and 
traditional of an elite grouping of in-
stitutions which seek to promulgate 
"higher education" at a significant cost 
to the rest of society. While millions of 
Americans search for jobs and hun-
dreds of millions live in abject pover.ty 
worldwide, $60 million will be expend-
ed here and billions more elsewhere to 
allow students to indulge in Kant, 
Freud, 
theoretical physics, 
multi-
variable calculus and 
classical 
literature. 

Through its financial aid program, 
Yale will foot part of the bill. But the 
bulk of the funding will come from 
parents, students and the govern-
ment. The cost of a Yale education is 
also subsidized by the generos.ity of 
alumni whose affiliation with Yale 
dates back to the school's all-male, all-
white, pre-enlightenment days. And it 
is sponsored, in part, by big business 
and the Department of Defense. 

Liberals at Yale cannot ignore the 
debt they owe to the upwardly mobile, 
affluent elements of American society 
which made their college education 
possible. They should ask themselves 
whether or not it is possible to preserve 
their beliefs while attending one of the 
most traditional and elitist institutions 
in the nation- an institution which, 
for centuries, has preserved the wealth 
and power of the wealthy and the 
powe~ful of the world's most wealthy 
and powerful nation. 

On the surface, Yale is widely 
reputed to be left of the political center. 
One summer ago, John Russo stood 
up before his classmates and blasted 
President Giamatti's "middle distance" 
speech during â€¢ Class Day. In the 
spring, students voted overwhelmingly 
in favor of the nuclear freeze. The Yale 
College Council championed- on 
paper, at least-a number of liberal 
causes. And large segments of the 
history and political science faculties 
endorsed liberal Democrat Toby Mof-
fett over slightly-less-liberal Repub-
lican Lowell W eicker in the latest 
Senatorial contest. 

But the activism of Yale's student 
body has never approached the legend-
ary heights of Berkeley and Col-
umbia. 
Yale's liberalism 
is 
more 
sedate, 
more bourgeois. 
Further-
more, when one peels back this outer 
layer of progressiveness, one discovers 
a solidly conservative core from which 
the university cannot deviate. 

Yale's architecture is borrowed from 
the Middle Ages and its structure from 
Oxford and Cambridge. In class-
rooms, the Old World overshadows the 
New World and the Third World. 

Much of w:hat is considered worth 
teaching and remembering was pro-
duced decades or centuries ago on a 
small plot of land which extends from 
Greece to France and north to Britain. 

At times, Yale can afford to be 
liberal. 
But not 
too liberal. 
In 
Kingman Brewster's days, the univer-
sity opened its doors to women and 
minor~ties, minimized corporate sup-
port 
for 
scientific 
research 
and 
stopped giving special consideration to 
applicants who were alumni children 
or "legacies." Alumni contributions 
fell. The university discovered itself in 
the midst of a minor financial crisis by 
the time President Giamatti took the 
helm. 

Those in control learned that they 
could not tamper with over 250 years 
of tradition. They learned that they 
could not stray far from Yale's often 
obscured and denied but conservative 
core and expect to remain financially 
solvent. 

Despite the leftist leanings of its pro-
fessors and the mild liberalism of its 
students, the purpose and mission of 
Yale is more amenable to the Party of 
the Right than the Young Socialist 
Alliance. 

For the university, according to 
sociologist Ivan lllich, has become the
