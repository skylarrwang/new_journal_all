It seemed appropriate to open the first 
issue of the year by explaining 
something about who we are and what 
we try to do in these pages. The N~ 
journal, 
very simply, 
is a 
news-
magazine about the people and ideas of 
Yale, published six times a year. It was 
first published in 1967 by Daniel 
Yergin and Jerry Bruck. It was a 
bright, 
irreverent and often con-
troversial magazine in those stormy 
years. In the late seventies, though, it 
fell under hard times and eventually 
folded. In 1981 the magazine was re-
established in its present form. 

The New journal has changed 
drastically since 1967, but certain 
things remain the same. For one thing, 
we only write about Yale and New 
Haven. We don't run stories about acid 
rain or El Salvador, not because we 
find 'r.ational issues unimportant, but 
simply because we don't have the 
resources to cover them. We have to 
draw a line somewhere, and New 
Haven seems to us to be the logical 
place. 

Besides, we've often discovered that 
we can cover national issues here at 
home in ways that national magazines 
can't. In past years, for example, we've 
taken a look at Department of Defense 
funding at Yale, we've investigated 
President Giamatti's arguments 
against the Moral Majority, and we've 
interviewed South African playwright 
Athol 
Fugard. 

Last year, former 
editor-in-chief Andy Court won the 
Yale Non-fiction Prize for his story on 
the Holocaust Survivors Videoarchive 
at Yale, and managing editor Morris 
Fanner's report on Taiwanese student 
surveillance was ust:d as a reference in 
a House subcommittee investigation. 

Another thing-we're not a political 
magazine. We don't endorse can-
didates or take partisan stands. That 
doesn't mean we don't have opinions; it 
just means we don't, as a magazine, 
subscribe to any political persuasion. 

Please drop us a line if you're in-
terested in us, if you're angry about 
something we've done wrong or simply 
pleased about something we've done 
right. Enjoy the issue, and look for us 
in October. -
