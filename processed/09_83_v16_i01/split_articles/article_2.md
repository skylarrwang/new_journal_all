EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Utter nonsense
To the Editor:
As one whose name was specifically
mentioned in the cover story of the
April 8 issue of The New Journal, I
believe that your readers deserve to
know what I told Morris Panner when
he contacted me last March and subse-
quently came to interview me on
March 7.

First I must set straight the nature of
my office. After severance of diplomatic
relations between our two countries, the
Coordination Council for North Ameri-
can Affairs (CCNAA) was created in
Taipei to handle and promote on our
behalf cultural, commercial and other
relations between the Republic of China
on Taiwan and the United States. My
office in Boston is one of the ten
CCNAA offices in the United States.

My government, deeply valuing the
traditional Sino-American friendship of
long standing, respects all American
laws and therefore never stoops to
engage in any activities such as the al-
leged "surveillance" or "monitoring" on
university campuses. We deplore those
elements unfriendly to our cause or
those who "often have axes of their own
to grind" (as Mr. Panner himself wrote)
when they employ shameful lies to
slander us.

It is utter nonsense to imply that my
office (or any counterpart office) gives
monthly "stipends" to student
"monitors."

As a general practice, students going
abroad for advanced studies do attend
some seminars before they leave the
home country. The main purpose of
such orientation process is to better
prepare the students to understand and
adapt to their new environment. That
is both a useful and laudable process. I
have never heard of anyone "undergoing
a week-long training session in which he
learns basic surveillance techniques."
And I very much resent such allegation.

Your cover article overplayed the
Yang Huan-hsi case and its alleged
remote, indirect tic with the Yale cam-
pus. Yang was arrested last January 5
when he arrived at the international air-
port at Taoyuan. After being confronted
with solid evidence proving his collusion
with Chinese Communists on the
mainland, Yang confessed to col-
laborating with the Communists. In
view of Yang's sincere expressions of
repentance, his age, his generally poor
health and the fact that he had acted
alone, the military prosecutor handling
the case had requested the court con-
sider leniency in sentencing Yang, sug-
gesting only a short-term of three years
of rehabilitation. In February, the
court went further than had been re-
quested by the prosecutor- by allow-
ing Yang to remain outside prison
walls, placing him merely under pro-
tective surveillance for the term of his
sentence.

Personal experience
As a student from Taiwan, I want to
thank you for your report, "Silent Dis-
sent: Taiwanese Students at Yale." By
giving Chinese Nationalist spies atten-
tion, they will probably have second
thoughts before publicly harrassing
Taiwanese students. in the U.S.

My personal experience of studying
at a public university on the West
Coast has left no doubt in my mind
that there are Chinese Nationalist spies
at the university.

When I first arrived at the universi-
ty, I joined the Chinese Student
Association. Even though I considered
myself Taiwanese instead of Chinese, I
joined because I did not want [the
Association members] to think I was
suspicious and put my name on their
"watch list." I was cautious not to
publicly criticize the ruling Chinese Na-
tionalist regime in Taiwan.

In December of 1978, former Presi-
dent Carter announced the normaliza-
tion of relations with China. [The
Association] asked me to take part in a
demonstration against the U.S. foreign
policy. They were angry at me because
I refused.

After that, I have been on their
"probable enemies" list. I know they
watch me and try to find fault with me.
What bothers me most is that they are
paid. In order to justify their pay they
may have to make reports. I don't know
if I will be safe if I return to Taiwan.


The letter signed by 32
[Yale
Taiwanese students] denying that spy-
ing takes place on campus, shown by
Mr. Cheng, does not mean anything.
If the president of the Chinese Student
Association of my school were to ask
me to sign a letter like that, probably I
would
have signed
it.
Very few
Taiwanese students would dare refuse.

One-sided
After I read "Silent Dissent: Taiwanese
Students at Yale," (TN] 4/8/83) I felt
sorry that there were so many mis-
understandings and mistakes in the arti-
cle.

Although
Mr.
Panner's
principal
sources are not explicitly identified,
material cited in The New Journal article
connects them with the Taiwanese Inde-
pendence Movement. The views of this
movement represent an extreme out-
side the mainstream of the Chinese
political situation. The Taiwanese In-
dependence Movement claims respon-
sibility for terrorist bombings and
assassination attempts worldwide. In
California, it has been banned for its
violent activities. Its systematic cam-
paign of distortion and its own admitted-
ly violent
tactics
should
make its
credibility as an original source extreme-
ly tenuous.

Mr. Panner cites the case of Lin Kuo-
Ching, a Chinese student at North
Carolina State University, Raleigh. The
New journal simply reports that Mr. Lin
was involved in a "controversy" and that
he fears that he cannot return to Taiwan
safely. Closer examination of the case
shows that Mr. Lin pleaded guilty in a
North Carolina district court to a charge
of illegal advertising in connection with
posting signs slandering another
Chinese student as a KMT spy. His
guilty plea was entered in exchange for
the dropping of a hazing charge that
arose from Mr. Lin's allegedly harassing
Chinese students on campus. However,
the very same person now told Mr. Pan-
ner that "I can promise you that surveil-
lance goes on in every campus in the
country, including .Yale."

Another point: the charge that any
defenders of the KMT are by implica-
tion campus spies should be treated as
the trial by innuendo that it truly is.
Rhetorical tactics such as this can have
no other aim than to discourage the
presentation of dissenting opinions.

The reader should at least recognize
that The New journal's article was one-
sided. It would seem that Mr. Panner's
unfortunate choice of sources has lent
itself to furthering the propaganda of an
extremist minority.

Name withheld
The author of the letter writes: "'I request that the
same protection of anonymity be extended to me
as to the sources cited in Panner's article. I have
more to .fear .from the Taiwan Independence
Movement than they have to fear from the
KMT"


Unfounded conjectures
The cover story in your April issue,
"Silent Dissent: Taiwanese Students at
Yale," was filled with distortions and
biased materials. It not only discred-
ited The New Journal but also defamed
the hard-working students
from
Taiwan, the Republic of China.

While it is Mr. Panner's claim that
he interviewed many Taiwan students
at Yale, he relies almost exclusively on
a pseudonymed Denny Liang for the
alleged spy activities on campus. But
even if one were to believe that there
were
no political motives behind
Liang's accusations, one could not find
a single piece of tangible evidence
which could support his claims.

Using Liang as a source, Mr. Pan-
ner charged Wang Li-dao, a former
graduate student in chemistry, as an
agent for the KMT. How convenient it
is. The only person who is so charged
is no longer here to defend himself. I
knew Wang personally while he was at
Yale. Here is an interesting character
who fancied himself as the James Bond
of the East. While it is possible that he
might have indeed proclaimed himself
as an agent for the KMT, many of us
also know that, on many occasions, he
claimed himself to be an agent for the
FBI. Would one then deduce from this
that
the
FBI
is
spying on
Yale
students? In any event, it defies com-
mon sense that a real spy would reveal
covert identities.

Apart from Denny Liang, Mr. Pan-
ner based the bulk of his story on
materials supplied by the Taiwanese
Independent Movement (TIM), an
outlawed organization in Taiwan as
well as in many states of this country
because of its violent terrorist activ-
ities,
whose declared mission
"dedicated to overthrowing the present
government on Taiwan" (p. 18). The
political motives of that organization
have never been in the closet, and it is
very clear who led Mr. Panner to the
elephant's tail.

We were told in your article that "it
is an accepted assumption among us in
the China field that surveillance takes
place, but I do not have any evidence"
(p. 18), that "common sense tells me
that it goes on" (p. 21), and that "it is
unrealistic to believe that the KMT
leaves Taiwan's students unwatched.
The stakes are simply too high" (p. 23).
Statements like these and otherwise
unfounded conjectures and specula-
tions fill the pages. The readers of The
New Journal deserve better than that.
We want the truth, but we distaste
incompetence in journalism.

Sincerely,
T.P. Ma Faculty Advisor to the
Yale Chinese Student Service

Editors Note: We agree with you that the
Taiwanese
Independent Movement
(T. I. M.) is not a legitimate source. Panner,
however, did not directly cite or quote any
T. I. M. spokesman. Panner drew from a
variety of sources: Congressional Records,
U.S. campus publications, publications both
sympathetic
and unsympathetic
to
T. I. M., Newsweek and Yale faculty
members.

As for the pseudonymed "Denny Liang,"
we need to make a clarification. At the request
of his sources, Panner used one pseudonym to
protect the anonymity of the six Yale students
whom he interviewed at length. While it is
certainly possible that some of them may have
been politically motivated, the confirmation
from the other sources makes it unlikely that
all of them were.

Says Panner: "I don't presume to have
made a definitive judgment about any ac-
tivities of the K. M. T. or of the T. I. M. I
had no political motivations in writing the
story. Rather, I wanted to broach an issue of
importance to the Yale community."
