fetch-t h e-stick, 
demolish-the-
vegetable-garde n, molest-your-knee-
cap type dog in kilograms? Probably the 
same kind of person who's about to get 
his jollies inducing venous air em-
bolism in that same dog. Hell, I could 
probably carve up Lassie herself if I 
convinced myself that she weighed 
kilograms. But she doesn't. Lassie 
never weighed a kilogram in her whole 
life. Lassie weighs good old American 
pounds, and always will. I got out of 
Becton quick, for a man with metric 
best friends is no friend of mine. 


Besides, time was getting on 
o 
10:30: "Desmosomal Proteins 
and Cytokeratins: Major Cytoskcletal 
Proteins of Epithelial Cells and Car-
cinomas." 
Special Cell 
Biology 
Seminar. Might as well have been in 
Chinese ... 
o o o 12:00 The "Timothy Dwight 
Chinese Table." Now let's get 
something straight right here. I don't 
speak Chinese. I don't write Chinese. I 
rarely even eat Chinese. But despite 
the fact that I didn't have a C hinaman's 
~hance of understanding what was be-
mg said, there I was, taking notes in an 
alcove of the TO dining hall while a 
stately-looking gentleman with salt-
and-pepper cowlick held court before a 
rapt audience of five. He was probably 
a good speaker, because he looked 
earnestly at each of his listeners in 
tur!l, and they looked back at him. I 
looked back too, nodding sagely or 
chortling with glee as the occasion 
s~med to call for it. 

In this way I discovered how much 
people who don't know what the hell 
youlre talking about can look like peo-
ple who know exactly what you're talk-
mg about. Then a strange thought pos-
sessed me: what if no one here speaks 
Chinese? What if they're all bluffing the 
speaker the same as I am? 

I decided to test my theory, so I 
laughed for no apparent reason and 
waited for the others to join in. 
!hey didn't. People started to glare 
at me. There I sat, my cover either 
blown or modified to accommodate a 
Chinese sense of humor I know not 
how bizarre, trying without success to 
fmesse my obstinately Angioid cackle 
into a bemused Confucian smile ... 


2:00 I had been looking forward 
all day to Nathaniel I,.aor's Philosophy 
Colloquiumentitled"Freeto Go Mad." 
For one thing, I felt I had a pretty good 
idea what all the words in the title 
meant this time. Which isn't something 
I can say about "Acetylene Polymeriza-
tion and Olefin Metathesis"- the sort 
of title that makes you wonder whether 
over all these years you've really been 
understanding the correct meaning of 
"and." Also, I expected that after a cou-
ple hours of calendar-hopping, I'd be 
just about ready for a lecture like "Free 
to go Mad." What I didn't bargain for 
was tha~ in five minutes, I'd be mad to 
go free. 

Before the professor's first sentence 
was over, he'd already used the word 
"commonsensical" twice. 
When 
I 
flashed my best apologetic smile and 
left, several paragraphs later, he was 
still discussing many tangential issues 
he did not intend to discuss ... 


2:20When I arrived soon after-
ward at "From Marginality to the In-
formal 
Sector: 
The Changing 
Character of Third World Urban 
Poverty," one Professor Alejandro 
Portes of Johns Hopkins had already 
finished discussing what he did not in-
tend to discuss and was well into 
whatever was left. He was certainly us-
ing all the words that appeared in the 
title of his lecture, only I could tell he'd 
redefined that all before I got there. I 
couldn't leave, though, because I had 
spotted one of my professors from last 
year. Now, I had to stick around to 
witness the look of incredulity that 
would appear on his face as it became 
apparent to him that I shared the same 
fascinat ion with 
the 
c h a n ging 
character of third world urban pover-
ty. This points up one of the more 
desirable fringe benefits of colloqu ~urn­
trotting: that of impressing and/or 
flabbergasting any professors who see 
you. 

Abruptly, the speaker began a para-
graph with "In summary ... " Home 
stretch, I thought, hot damn. Little did 
I know the "in summary" is an 
oratorical convention 
which 
social 
scientists employ to mark the mid-
points of their lectures. After he had 
tossed in a "to conclude" and a "finally, 
very briefly," I realized that he was not 
merely observing one of the time-
honored customs of his trade, but in-
stead suffering from the advanced 
stages of a nervous disorder which 
m anifests itself in recurrent conclu-
sions. This terminal terminality often 
moves those in attendance to wonder 
whether the spectacle will ever end. 

For all I know, Professor Portes may 
be expostulating still. My departure 
certainly didn't faze him, as I stalked 
off to my last appointment of the day at 
the Career Advisory and Placement 
Service, where Coopers and Lybrand, 
Incorporated, was presenting informa-
tion on ... 


... 4:1$ "Careers in Accounting." 
Whether the pinstriped man with the 
blow-dried, Wheatie-colored hair was 
Cooper and Lybrand, I couldn't tell. 
But I nursed a private hope that 
somehow he combined the most unc-
tuous qualities of both. The aim of his 
profession he explained, is to maintain 
and expand one's client's holdings as 
much as possible, while naturally "try-
ing to stay within the letter of the law." 

I could tell right off this guy had the 
same regard for the law that a 
tapeworm has for a bowel. 

This accountant sat straight as a 
ledger column in his chair and looked 
at me precisely every twenty seconds. 
He spoke in a manner so good-natured 
and off-the-cuff that I knew it had to be 
memorized. His Ouffy head made a 
regular arc that took in aJI ten faces in 
the room. He reminded me of an auto-
mated sprinkler. This was the sort of 
guy who says "Quite so" when he 
means "yes," and "I beg your pardon" 
when he means "huh?" 

A hideous thought overtook me: the 
other nine people in the room- they 
think I want to be an accountant! My 
hands went instantly clammy. But 
wait- those nine people- they do want 
to be accountants! I ned, wondering 
whether my host was going to keep 
looking over at my chair every twenty 
seconds. 

This final encounter was useful, (as I 
devoutly believe everything in the 
Calendar is), if only because it sum-
moned many of my own career anx-
ieties to the fore. I fully realize the oc-
cupation of "writer" ranks just above 
Mafia chieftain and manager of the 
New York Yankees on the stability 
scaJe. With this in mind, I have altered 
my career plans, for I now intend to as-
sume a profession of far greater impor-· 
tance to my fellow man. Yes, make no 
m istake, I am the next editor of the 
Yale Weekry Bulktin and Calendar. Joyce 
Lowry has done a legendary job during 
her tenure in the position, but, like 
Willy Wonka before her, Ms. Lowry 
knows that she will someday have to 
bestow her trade secrets upon a 
carefully chosen successor. And when 
that time comes, Ms. Lowry, I'll be 
here waiting. You can find me at the 
Afrikaans Table in Commons-we'll 
go Dutch treat ...
