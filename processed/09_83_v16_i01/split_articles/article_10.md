Diaz-
Aiejandro has been accused by some 
Cuban exiles and conservative groups 
of being sympathetic to the policies of 
Fidel Castro and other left 
wing 
leaders in Latin America. 
Professor Oiaz-Aiejandro, who was 
born in Cuba, earned his Ph.D. in 
Economics from 
M .I.T. 
in 1961. 
Three years later he became a perma-
nent resident of the United S tates. He 
came to Yale in 1969 and since then 
has served on numerous government 
commissions on Latin Ame rican af-
fairs.


**New Haven's Mounted Police**

Wandering around the Green 
this fall are the four newest m embers of 
the New H aven Police Department. 
Trained for five and a half weeks by 
the Ne-.v York C ity Police fo r their new 
duties, Crackerjack, Misch ief, Carla 
and Breton have been on the force 
since early this summer. 
The four-legged members of New 
Haven's newly-founded 
m ounted 
patrol now resides at the Yale Stables on 
Central Avenue. The horses were 
donated to the city and will be used for 
routine patrols and for crowd control 
around the Green and the Yale cam -
pus. For the moment the police do not 
intend to add to their mounted force. 
«If they work out," said Commander 
.Jim O'Neill of the New Haven Police 
Department, "then we'll expand the 
program ."


**Sherman and Shubert Theatre Renovations**

"You're going to get a whole new 
city," said Ed Yoe, vice-president and 
general manager of the Schiavone 
Entertainment Company. "You won't 
even recognize it." Yoe is talking about 
the two renewal projects, already well-
underway, that will grace the area 
around the New H aven G reen over the 
next few years: the Sherman and the 
Shubert Theatres. 
On September 12 the first of what 
will undoubtedly be a long string of 
star-studded dedications will take place 
under the marquee of the old Roger 
Sherman movie house on College 
Street. The Schiavone Company is us-
ing the invitation-only event to unveil 
the new name for the theater, which is 
undergoing a $1.2 million transforma-
tion from run-down movit" house to 
multi-purpose music hall. 
The renovation of the Sherman, 
scheduled to be completed around the 
first of the year, is just part of a $21 
million entertainment district centered 
around College Street that is the brain-
child ofYa.le a.lum j oel Schiavone (TNJ 
December 5, 1981). The Sherman, 
though now only part of the larger Col-
lege Street project, was once quite im-
portant in itself. It was built as a major 
vaudeville house and later became a 
first-run movie house where many 
films, including Butch Cassidy and the 
Sundance Kid, 
had their world 
premieres. It closed in 1979, having 
severely deteriorated. The Schiavone 
Company is trying to return the 
theater to its earlier splendor and to 
use it as an anchor for the entertain-
ment district.


**Athol Fugard's New Play at Yale Rep**

It has been two years since South 
African playwright Athol Fugard's 
award-winning Master Harold ... and 
the Boys had its world premiere at the 
Ya1e Rep. Fugard will return this 
spring to direct the world premiere of 
another new play, tentatively titled My 
En.elish Name Is Patience. 
Like most of his other works, this is 
a play about South Africa. Yet it a.lso 
i marks a departure for Fugard- for the 
~ first time the plot revolves around 
~ women. Though the play is not yet 
finished, and only R ep Artistic Direc-
~ tor Lloyd R ichard s has spoken with 
1 Fugard about the script, the Rep plans 
~ to present the play from May 1 to 19.


**Increased Student Ticket Prices at Yale Rep**

For students, seeing My English Name 
and the other seven plays in the Rep's 
season will be more expensive and 
more difficult than in the past. The 
price of student Passbooks has risen 
almost 50 percent to $36, and the 
number available has been reduced by 
500 to 2500. Rosalind H einz, the 
Rep's public relations director, ex-
plained, "We felt we were losing our 
shirts by underwriting such low prices 
for student tickets. 
Look at York 
Square Cinema. They charge $4 to 
$4.50 for their movies while we were 
only charging around S3 for <ilur 
plays."
