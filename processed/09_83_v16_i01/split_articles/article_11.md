These are The Whiffenpoofs of Yale University, 
Incorporated- the world's most treasured college 
troubadors, who have sung their way from ivied 
obscurity to international limelight and who, since 
1981, have been running one of the best little Con-
necticut businesses going. 


These are the fourteen ambassadors of Elihu 
Yale who travel the United States and abroad in 
tuxes and white gloves and pass out engraved 
business cards after every show. They've had to 
hire a twenty-four hour answering service to stay 
on top of the business calls. And each year the 
members of this corporation log more than enough 
international air mileage to qualify for membership 
in even the most exclusive travel club. 


As Yale's most sought-after export, the Whiffen-
poofs command four-digit fees for appearances at 
venues as diverse as the new Tokyo Disneyland, 
the annual National Review banquet, Saturday Night 
Live and state dinners in Istanbul. They are 
honored at the tables of presidents, kings, princes 
and counts. They are feted from New Haven to 
Nice and from Manhattan to Monte Carlo. 


This year the Whiffs turn 75. Make no mistake, 
Yale's once-informal senior a cappella group is big 
business now. They still sing for their supper at 
Mory's every Monday night, to be sure, but the 
Whiffs of 1984 are nothing like the Whiffs of 1909. 
They've found that tradition is not only an excuse 
for having a good time. 
It's also something quite 
marketable.

Don't be fooled by the cavalier image 
tht· Whiffs project at some of their on-
campus jamborees. The Whiffs work 
hard. They are willing to let their grades 
suffer, to work 60-hour weeks, and even 
to drop out of school for a year (as five of 
tht• 1983 group did) to be a part of the 
corporation. They tour some 15 coun-
tries• during their world tour each sum-
mer and they perform over 250 concerts 
over the course of the year. There is also 
a two-week "retreat" spent on Martha's 
Vineyard in late August, and an entire 
month spent in recording studios pro-
ducing an album in the spring. 


The Whiffenpoofs may be doing well 
for themselves in the eighties, but they 
arc 
making 
their success by 
perpetuating the past. Although they 
art• without question the best-known 
and the most intriguing singing group at 
Yak, there are people here who have 
mixed emotions about the Whiffen-
poofs. Many students view them as a 
throwback to Yale's faraway Great 
Gatsby days, where the perfect dinner 
jac-ket and the gentleman's "C" were 
more important than the resume. 


More than once they have been ac-
cused of chauvinsim, of elitism, o( 
WASPishness, and it is still true that 
they arc overwhelmingly Anglo. In 
their tails the Whiffs can look rather 
like 14 identical penguins- there's not 
much room for original dress or way-
ward hairdos. Ivy League conformity 
is what the Whiffenpoofs are all about. 
and that's what people seem to go for 
"If our audiences didn't think of us as a 
group, we wouldn't be going around 
the world," says John Rogers, an ef-
fusive second tenor who took the year 
off. "None of us is a Lola Falaoa or a 
Mick Jagger." 


The stylish, conservative, and often 
superficial lifestyle which they have so 
carefully cultivated can make the Whiffs 
seem more than a little arrogant at 
times. Like modern-day patricians, the 
WhtO's somehow always manage to look 
<Ls though they lead lives of uncom-
promising leisure. But it is exactly this 
quality that makes them one of those 
charming anachronisms on the Yale 
campus of the eighties. They make it 
look all so easy. When you listen to "The 
Whiffenpoof Song" reverberating_ from 
the rafters of Battell Chapel, the sound 
of their voices is impossibly remote. 


And if you dose your eyes and compare 
the sound to a 1953 recording of the 
same song, you'll hear absolutely no dif-
ference. The WhiiTenpoofs are a strange 
amalgam- part fraternity, part glee 
club, part drinking society-dandies 
straight from a Cole Porter lyric.
