into a confused, bloody fray in which 
Chinese adolescents were the major 
participants. Mao closed schools and 
directed the youth in full-time strug-
gles to rid the country of "pernicious 
bourgeois influences" among the Party 
ranks, their teachers, their parents 
and their fellows. It was the youths 
themselves who subjected these 
"enemies" of the Party to the physically 
abusive indoctrination sessions of the 
R evolution. They vilified, imprisoned 
and 
killed; 
they vandalized and 
destroyed museums and te_mples, in-
deed, any relic of old ideas. "Bourgeois" 
educational customs such as examina-
tions and reports were abolished. The 
provincial schools were closed for three 
to six years. Students who did go to 
school received a m inimal background 
in the basics and spent much of their 
time in the fields or factories. Tradi-
tional education was superseded by 
daily recitations of the quotes of Chair-
man Mao. 

Literature suffered greatly under 
M ao. The only stories and poems 
deemed acceptable were those that told 
of class struggle and the revolution. No 
characters were allowed to exist in 
moral shades of gray. They had to be 
Iabelle~ clearly "good" or "bad" accor-
ding "to class background and loyalty to 
the Party. 

One lesson that China's youth 
learned during the Cultural Revolu-
tion was to criticize the Party. It was a 
lesson they did not forget. By the mid-
seven ties, the youth collectively began 
to 
realize 
that 
they 
had 
been 
manipulated in what amounted to a 
power struggle 
between 
top-level 
politicians. 

On April 5, 
1976, thousands of 
Chinese gathered at Peking's Gate of 
Heavenly Peace in memory of the 
• recently deceased Zhou en-Lai. 
Gradually, the tension and grief within 
the congregation erupted into an emo-
tional explosion. In front of the Gate, 
the people began spontaneously to 
write. They wrote on scraps of parch-
ment, on the walls and d irectly on the 
pavement in every poetic form im-
aginable. Such a mass outpouring of 
feeling had not been known since the 
start of the Revolution. This daring act 
proved to be an irrevocable step 
toward a 
literature free from the 
Party's categorical restraints of the 
past. 

New 
Realism 
literature, 
which 
developed in the years after this inci-
dent, has become "mu ch more subtle," 
according to Yale History Professor 
J onathan Spence, who wrote the for-
ward to the book. "People have come 
that you 
can't 
blame 
everything on the Cultural Revolu-
tion." "This literature, which was in-
itially sanctioned by the Party, allowed 
the Chinese to derive hope from 
tragedy," said Ennen. "They could 
point out foibles and move on." 

Though literary modes and styles in 
Chin~se literature cc.:fr\stantly changed, 
all of the literature subsequent to the 
Cultural R evolution has maintained 
certain common traits. Written by a 
generation whose truths became lies 
and whose rights became wrongs, the 
literature following the Cultural 
Revolution has conveyed the nation's 
mourning of an era. 

In the midst of such moral and emo-
tional dilemmas, China's youth has 
produced a literature in which suicide 
is a recurring theme. Between 1976 
and the present, the subject matter has 
always proved powerful and emotional 
regardless of genre or style. In fact,
