Not all of the technicians work with 
the animals at such an intense level. 
Yale breeds some of its own research 
animals at a 14-acre farm in Bethany, 
Connecticut. Technicians there are 
more like farm hands, tending the 
livestock in the barn and the dogs in 
the kennels. Twenty minutes from the 
Yale campus, the relaxed, rural at-
mosphere of the farm seems far from 
the pressures of the experiments at the 
Med School. The sheep graze in a 
fenced-in field. The pigs rub their 
snouts against the rough wood s~y in 
the new barn. One pig is a little bigger 
than the others. He is, according to 
Brickett, "the ugliest pig in the world." 
Big Bert, Yale's premier breeding 
swine is a "pig with a whole lot of 
character," claims 
one 
technician 
defensively. 

Like all the other animals connected 
with the labs, however, the farm 
animals are destined for specific ex-
periments. Big Bert, despite his looks, 
is a genetically pure animal who will be 
used in breeding for organ transplant 
experiments. Unlike Jacobson or her 
boss Dr. Pitt, the technicians here in 
Bethany never really need to exercise 
any detachment. They never see the 
animals suffer. They can worry about 
the animals, but in the end, there will 
always be another Big Bert. 

"The veterinary philosophy is not to get 
involved in the argument-we will let 
the two forces argue it out and do our 
job as directed," says Dr. Steven 
Barthold, a veterinarian and acting 
Director of Yale's Division of Animal 
Care. Barthold would seem to have an 
impossibly contradictory 
role. 
As 
director of the division, he approves 
proposals for animal research that 
ultimately lead 
to 
the animals' 
sacrifice. Yet, as a veterinarian, he is 
responsible for preserving the health of 
the animals. As a result, he must settle 
on an uneasy neutrality. 

"From a professional point of view, 
as veterinarians, 
we 
all 
have 
philosophical problems with animal 
research. We tend to be more animal 
rights advocates 
than 
unlimited 
research advocates," says Barthold. At 
the same time, however, Barthold em-
phasizes the importance of animal-
related studies. "I don't think that peo-
ple realize what effect the lack of 
animal. research would have on their 
lives." 

In practice, Barthold a nd other 
veterinarians resolve the philosophical 
conflict with an ambivalent com-
promise. They only approve animals 
for research when they are sure that 
the experiment causes as little pain as 
possible. 
They 
a lso provide the 
animals with care while they are at the 
facility. 

The federal government plays a 
prominent ·role in insuring animal 
care. "If there were no federal regula-
tions governing the use of animals in 
research," 
asserts 
Barthold, 
"there 
would be no veterinarians in the Yale 
Medical School." The Animal Welfare 
Act establishes certain standards for 
the use and treatment of animals in 
research. Connecticut also legislates a 
number of specific guidelines, in-
cludin'g a prohibition against operatiny 
on the same animal more than once. 
In addition, the National Institutes 
of H ealth (N. I. H.), one o f the in-
vestigators' chief sources of grant fund-
ing, has its own set of rules. In order to 
insure the quality of animal care at 
Yale, the Medical School decided to 
become accredited by the American 
Association for the Accreditation of 
Laboratory Animal Care (AAA-LAC). 

While AAA-LAC 
recognizes the 
minimum standards"set forth by the 
Animal. Welfare Act, it recommend s 
an even higher level of care. "N.I.H. 
would like to have all of its research 
done under these standards," says 
Barthold, explaining that AAA-LAC 
inspects the facility periodically. "They 
go over the institution with white 
gloves-literally," he says. "We get 
unannounced visits from the USDA, 
but since we have AAA-LAC ac-
creditation, we have very few prob-
lems." 

But cost is the greatest 
fact.or

For example, an

mongrel dog that once could be ob-
tained for $20 or $30 now costs $200 
because of increased regulation. "The 
effect has been that fewer animals are 
being used in research," says Barthold. 
This increased cost of animals has 
limited the total amount of research 
that is done. No longer can a lab afford 
to run ambitious projects. "Th e money 
is drying up," says Barthold. "There 
isn't the boom of research that there 
was in the 50's and 60's." 

Even the systems which veterinarians 
have developed to spare animals are 
based 
on 
a 
combination of 
humanitarian and economic 
prin-
ciples. "Animals are recycled to other 
investigators so 
that a 
minimum 
number of animals are used," explains 
Barthold. This system of animal pool-
ing is an informal arrangement. When 
a researcher needs to sacrifice an 
animal, he will inform his colleagues 
around the country. In turn, they may 
request the organs and vital parts that 
they need. In Pitt's lab, 
the few 
animals that are used in 
chronic 
studies each year are also used by other 
labs for bone marrow research. This 
arrangement saves the 
greatest 
number of animals and minimizes the 
costs at the same time. 

And the costs are considerable. A 
monkey costs a couple of hundred 
dollars, a lamb goes for $100, and a 
newborn lamb for $300. Even the mice 
can be expensive: some specialized 
strains, born by cesarean section, have 
breeding histories which extend back 
100 generations and will cost up to $10 
per mouse. One Yale researcher uses 
12,000 m ice every year. Each month 
the animals consume 15 tons of Purina 
animal chow. 

Animal housing and daily upkeep 
also contribute to the expense. One 
third of the animal costs in an average 
grant go toward the upkeep of the 
animals. It just doesn't make sense to 
keep more animals around than are 
absolutely necessary. 

The rats live in cubby-hole sized 
cages which look like steel and plex-
iglass skyscrapers- Co-op city for rats 
at four cents a day. The primates cost 
even more to house. Accessories oflux-
ury litter their cages-a squeaky rub-
ber duck, fuschia polyester fabric strips 
and assorted other· trinkets. High style 
at $2.50 a day. 

Despite the regulations and 
elaborate care facilities, Barthold still 
needs to be wary of the safety of the 
animals. "There is a varying degree of 
sensitivity to animal welfare," observes 
Barthold, "It is a problem anywhere 
and it is something that we keep our 
eyes and ears open for." 

On occasion, Barthold will identify a 
lab in which the animals are not being 
treated properly. "Usually it is because 
an investigator is too busy and has not 
been 
in 
direct contact with 
the 
animals," explains Barthold. Often a 
technician who is not familiar with the 
regulations will be doing the work for 
the researcher. In some cases, Barthold 
steps in himself, placing the animal 
directly under his care. "We step in and 
treat the animal however we feel it 
should be treated, and we charge the 
investigator for our services." The only 
difference between us an d the other 
medical departments is that our clients 
are animals and theirs are people," says 
Barthold. 

In 
more severe cases, 
Barthold would stop the research com-
pletely. At Yale, Barthold has never had 
to do this. The air is one of coopera-
tion. "I think that Yale has a pretty sen-
sitive group of investigators." 

Not everyone agrees with Barthold's 
assessment of the role of .a vet in a 
research lab. "If you're at a cocktail 
party," says Barthold, "people ask you 
what you do. And you say you are a 
veterinarian. Then they ask you where 
you practice, and you say at the Yale 
Medical School. They get turned off." 

For those who disagree with an imal 
!!Xperimentation, no amount of care 
for the animals makes the research any 
more palatable. But for the people at 
the school, the emotional side of the 
argument is suppressed. It has to be 
that way. "Even when you go through 
all the doors that say 'warning' and 
'danger,'" says one assistant researcher, 
"you get into a routine. It's not that dif-
ferent from working anywhere else."
