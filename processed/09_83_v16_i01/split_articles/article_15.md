"Once it has been anesthetized, it becomes research, and the animal stops being an animal."
Jacobson believes in the importance of her work. In one study, Jacobson assists in research designed to simulate oxygen deprivation in newborn children. The results from this study ultimately may help doctors treat babies who might otherwise suffer chronic organ damage. Jacobson also realizes the value of the surgical experience that doctors gain from using animals. "Surgery is so precise that you just can't play around. You really need to know what you're doing," she says. "Advances are made in new techniques which result from doing one tiny thing differently. It's much better to learn on an animal than on a person."
To do her work well, Jacobson must maintain a level of scientific detachment, regardless of how much she may care for the animals. "I don't think a surgeon could do his work well if he kept feeling for the patient," she insists.
But unlike a surgeon, Jacobson knows that in some cases the patients are not intended to survive. "In using an animal for a chronic study, there are two points at which you feel badly. The first point is when you bring the animal up to the lab. The other is when you actually anesthetize the animal. Once it has been anesthetized, though, the animal is out cold. It becomes a job and you do your thing. It becomes research, and the animal stops being an animal."
The researchers themselves rarely see the animals except during the actual study. For Pitt and other scientists, the animals serve as complex scientific models. Their primary purpose is to supply information. The whole relationship to the animal changes. "If an extremely valuable animal is involved in valuable research," explains Pitt, "we are more likely to give it a name. Almost invariably there is an attachment to animals that provide longitudinal period data."
