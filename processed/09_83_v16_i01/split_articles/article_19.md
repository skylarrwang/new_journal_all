"It's time for me to start leading the kind of life that I want." 
the Yankees when they are on television. I'll sit down and watch for an hour or two, but you have to do things which are more worthwhile, which give more to society. There's a great feeling when the crowd roars when you're on the field. I once said that there was no exhilaration that equalled carrying the football, and I still agree with that. But now I'm looking more for a psychological than a physical satisfaction. I'm ready to begin my vocation." 

This month the new training will begin, and the trade will be complete- the aqua Dolphin jersey for a lab coat. 

"Yeah, maybe it does sound funny. Maybe it sounds like I'm contradicting myself by giving up something I like so much. But sometimes you have to give up what you like to give more to society. I hope I get satisfaction out of medicine, but I know that it won't be the same. In medicine, there's no crowd cheering. The rest of the world won't care if you lose the use of your right wrist," he said as he moved his forearm across the table. For the first time in an hour, he's broken the conversation with a gesture. 

Returning to his unassuming pose, he has fixed his rolled sleeves. "I'll be happy if I can help a few people. I'm not out to change the world." But there is something deceptive about his modesty. You sort of feel like the linebacker who watches Diana scoot into the end zone after you've been told that Rich Diana just tries not to drop the ball. Diana isn't brash. He doesn't push people around. They make the mistake of giving him the extra step all on their own. 

"I'd be a fool to say I didn't have a lot of natural ability. Although I'm a lot smarter and faster than many people, there are plenty of people who are bigger and stronger than me," said Diana, who at a solid 215 pounds looks like he could intimidate the tractors on the farm near his home. "But no one ever saw how hard I had to work. I have a determination and a will to sacrifice which a lot of people don't have." This intensity made Diana as good a student as he was an athlete. Plenty of schools would have taken him if he could have spelled his name, but Diana did quite a bit more, graduating third in his Hamden High School class, a prime academic candidate for Yale. 

At Yale he graduated cum laude in MB&B, and he became something of a folk hero. Bulldog pizza still sells the Rich Diana Special, though it has come a long way from the original: Diana's favorite snack of a pepperoni pizza in a grinder roll. "I guess that was kind of disgusting," admitted Diana. 

It doesn't seem quite right that someone who did so much for Yale football is immortalized by a hoagie. The 1981-82 Ivy champs devastated Harvard, 28-0, and beat Navy on national television. For the first time in a decade, ABC and Sports Illustrated took the Bulldogs seriously. "We had a pretty special team my senior year," recalled Diana. "There were just a few of us who made the difference. I made a lot of money for Yale, but the administration never seemed to appreciate that. I feel a responsibility to a lot of things, but Yale isn't one of them. I used Yale, and they used me." 

Besides near record attendance at the Bowl, ABC televised two of Yale's games (Navy and Dartmouth) largely on the attraction of Diana, Rogan, Grieve, Rohrer and Leone. The television contracts alone netted Yale almost half a million dollars. Out of a total athletic department budget of only about $4 million, that wasn't bad. Yale's athletic policy did not make it easy for Diana to get into the pros.
