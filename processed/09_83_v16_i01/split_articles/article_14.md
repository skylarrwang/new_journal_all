In the steam tunnels, vein-like clusters 
of pipe course through the passage-
ways. Bloated with traffic, the tunnels 
are like anerit•s. An orange G.E. trac-. 
tor, tagged "The Lil' Bo Peep Express," 
ferrit·s 
50-pound bags of Purina 
Monkey Chow to proper destinations. 
The tractor beeps insistently as scien-
tists, 
veterinarians and technicians 
scurry from its path. Across the street 
at Yale-New llavcn l lospital, few pa-
tients have ever S<'<'n this area. Many 
do not even know that it exists. But, to 
the dot·tors who treat them, animal 
research often provides the key to their 
success. 

At any given time, there are 25,000 
animals at the Yale M edical School 
facilities . Ov<·r the course of a year, 
rescarcht•rs at Yak usc more than 
170,000 animals. This is a relatively 
small numb<·r <:omparcd to the roughly 
60 million animals that arc used every 
year nationwide. The.• use of these 
animals for research is an emotionally 
char~t·d issue gem·ratin~ national a nd 
international controversy. In Great 
Britain, tlw opponents of animal re-
search have formed their own political 
party, th<· Anti-Vivisectionists. In the 
United States, anti-vivisection groups 
have gained nationwide support. The 
New 
England Anti-Vivisectionist 
Society, one of the strongest, had a 
net worth of over $1 million last year. 

But, for all the public fervor, the 
moral dikmma is most immediate for 
the peopk who deal with the animals 
every day. 

"I like to play with the lambs and pet 
them," says Kirsten .Jacobson, assistant 
researcher to Dr. Bruce Pitt at the Yale 
24 The New Journal/September 9, 1983 
Medical School. "They get to trust you 
so much so they don't baa when you 
take them up to the lab. You're like 
their second mother. But you get into 
this work bt·cause you're a scientist." 

Jacobson and other assistant research-
ers provide the link between the scien-
tists in their labs and the animals in 
their cages. Jt is a morally and emo-
tionally taxing job to have to care for 
an animal for the duration of an ex-
periment. Most of the animal research 
at Yale i~ long-term survival research. 
A single experiment will monitor an 
animal's progress over the course of 
months or even years . .Jacobson works 
with seven to I 0 lambs per year in ex-
periments on lung physiology. All of 
the lambs will survive several months. 
This extended contact makes it all the 
more difficult for Jacobson to deposit 
the dead animals in the freezer. "You 
just do it quickly," she says. 

Jacobson, who ~raduated from col-
lege two years ago, grew up on a ranch 
in 
Colorado. 
"Working with lab 
animals is similar to working with 
ranch animals," she says. "You play 
with them, but you know that in the 
spring all of the calves will go to 
market." Although Jacobson grew up 
with the 
necessity of sacrificing 
animals, she is still sensitive to com-
ments about her work. "One lady got 
mad at me when I was bringing a lamb 
up in the elevator-she called me a .. 
murderer," she says. "I can't under-
stand that- especially when they are 
employees of the Medical School ot the 
Hospital. They should know better. If 
we lose an animal, we feel really terri-
ble."
