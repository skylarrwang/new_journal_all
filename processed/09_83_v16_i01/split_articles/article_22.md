Mao's Harvest: Voices from China's New 
Generation Edited by Helen F. Siu and 
Zelda Stern 
Oxford University Press. 1983 
In 1979 a political thaw in Communist 
China allowed the voices of protest to 
surface in the nation's tightly con-
trolled literature. An unprecedented 
literary form known as "New Realism" 
offered the first vivid picture of people 
in Red China- the feelings, emotions 
and attitudes of a culture so poorly 
understood in the West. 

By 1981 the Communist Party had re-
imposed controls. Dissent was stifled 
once again. 

The writings which have emerged 
from this brief period are remarkable 
not only for their candor and unequiv-
ocal protest, but also for the emotions 
and doubts which they express. The 
writers, most of them in their thirties, 
have boldly deviated from the unimpas-
sioned lip service to socialism and the 
Party that characterized earlier 
Chinese literature. With anger and 
sorrow they have decried the im-
poverishment·, oppression and corrup-
tion they see in their homeland. The 
young writers have responded to 
political and social situations with am-
bivalence, doubt and despair- emo-
tions that had never been acknowl-
edged 
in 
the Socialist 
Realisrn. 
literature which predominated during 
the decades immediately after Mao's 
rev0lution in 1949.


**Title: Mao's Harvest**
**Page number(s): 42**

The title of Helen Siu and Zelda 
Stern's new anthology of writings from 
those three years of protest echoes in 
bitter irony. The collection is called 
Mao's Harvest, for the works are the 
fruit of the first generation to grow up 
in Mao's socialist China. But it is also 
called Mao's Harvest because it reveals a 
young generation cut off at its prime 
by the political system that fostered it. 

The body of writings that Siu and 
Stern have collected in this volume 
mark only a first step in the under-
standing of China's new generation. A 
professor of anthropology, Siu is one of 
just a handful of scholars working on 
this material. Because so little is known 
of this literature in the West, her an-
thology will prove indispensible to 
future scholars in Chinese literature 
and history. 

Whc;n it first emerged in 1979, New 
Realism 
was 
immediately popular 
among China's 
urban 
youth. 
"It 
became the common vocabulary of the 
young," said Melissa Ennen, a Yale 
graduate student who was living in 
China during the years the literature 
was first being published. "By opening 
up discussion, China's social problems 
became clear and acute.,· 

New Realism is, in part, an exten-
sion of the protest against the Cultural 
Revolution. 
Through it, 
China's 
young writers 
have 
rejected 
the 
socialist credos which were ingrained 
at every step of their carefully pro-
. grammed education. "These writers 
came of age during the Cultural 
Revolution," Siu said. "The new focus 
on emotion affirmed the validity of the 
inner self. This is a highly unorthodox 
notion in the MaoistJiterary tradition 
in which such expression would have 
been considered a threat to the collec-
tive spirit of socialist China." 

One cannot 
understand Chinese 
literature of the seventies without 
understanding something about the 
Cultural Revolution of a 
decade 
earlier. Initiated by Mao in 1966 to 
root out corruption in the Party. the 
Cultural Revolution rapidly escalated
