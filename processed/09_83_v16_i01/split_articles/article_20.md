Mind Over Music 
If you put an album on your turntable, 
turn on your stereo and then leave the 
room so that no one is there to hear it, 
does the music exist? This musical twist 
to the philosopher's paradox has been 
puzzling Mary Louise Serafine ever 
since she gave up her aspirations of 
musical stardom 12 years ago and went 
into the decidedly unromantic field of 
developmental psychology. But after 
four years of research at Yale, Serafine 
sounds less and less like either a musi-
cian or a psychologist and more like a 
Lord Berkeley who has learned to 
swing. "What counts with music is what 
is in the mind of the perceiver," she in-
sists. "If you don't understand the 
music, it doesn't exist for you." 
"If you don't 
understand the 
music, it doesn't 
exist for you." 
Serafine has pioneered an inter-
disciplinary approach to musical analysis 
that stresses the cognitive rather than 
the sensory skills of the listener. In other 
words, she beli.t:ves that people like a 
particular piece of music not because it 
conforms to some universal aesthetic, 
but because their minds simply tell 
them that it is good. In her research at 
Yale, she has di<;covered that under-
standing music is an active process 
rather than a passive one- that the 
mind doesn't just receive the notes but 
in fact organizes them into patterns that 
are unique to each individual. 

Serafine has recently completed a 
paper setting forth her new ideas which 
wiiJ be published early this faJJ in the 
psychology periodical Cognition. She 
has also accepted an offer from Colum-
bia University Press to publish a book 
at the end of the year which will be en-
titled Cognition in Music. 

But even more important than the 
details of her 
findings, 
Serafine's 
research points to an entirely new ap-
proach to music. Serafine believes that 
most people greatly underestimate their
