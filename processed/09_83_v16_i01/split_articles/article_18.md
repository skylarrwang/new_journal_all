A Whole New Ballgame 
The Miami Dolphins were warming up for their afternoon pre-season 
practice. This Sunday number 33 was parked in his parents' kitchen in 
Hamden, sitting stiffly as if he couldn't quite shake the soreness from his 
last practice. A small window unit was blowing cold air. It was a humid 
day outside, not as bad as Dade County, but uncomfortable enough to 
keep the conversation inside. He wasn't sweating. His black hair was 
parted on the sid~.

'"There were a lot of things I didn't like 
about professional football," D iana 
said , "but I didn't quit just because I 
wasn't making a lot of great plays. It 
was frustrating. I carried the ball o nly 
once ir) pre-season. That isn't enough 
to show what you can do. I think I 
could have been an outstanding play-
er, but I never got the chance." 

Even his most devoted fans would 
say that Yale's second leading all-time 
rusher !:tad a mediocre first year in the 
N.F. L. He gained only 31 yards with a 
:long carry of seven, and this year wasn't 
looking any better. O n July 16th R ich 
D iana walked out of D on ShuJa's train-
ing camp in M iami and left pro-foot-
ball behind. He's returning to Yale and 
will begin training for a second career 
at the M edical School. 

D iana doesn't have any simple 
explanation for why he left. Since he


has been home this summer, he has 
been doing quite a lot of thinking and 
writing about his d<Â·dsion. Besides be-
ing interviewed by Howard Cosell and 
the Ntw York Timts, Diana has been 
workin~ on a book which will be pub-
lisht>d latf'r this year. In the book, 
D iana will try to explain to the world 
and to himself what pro football is real-
ly like. Being an author is probably the
"I could have been an out-
standing player, but I never 
got a chance." 

last thing Diana's MB&B advisor 
would have predicted for the 3.5 pre-
med. And even Diana doesn't enjoy 
writing. "But I've got something to of-
fer," he said. "It won't be a Ball Four. 
I'm not out to debase anyone, but I 
think it will surprise a few people. 

"' too was surprised by what pro 
football was like," Diana said, the 
flourescent coil flickering above him. 


"No ooe understands it until they ac-
tually play. It doesn't matter how many 
college games you've been in." When 
Diana showed up in Miami in the sum-
mer of 1982, he began playing a game 
which seemed to lack almost everything 
he had loved about football at Yale. 

"Carm [Cozza] and Seb [LaSpina, 
Yale's offensive coordinator] wanted 
you to learn and improve. They cared 
about you and wanted you to have 
everything-social 
life,. academics 
-everything. In Miami, the coaches 
didn't tolerate any mistakes. They 
would cuss at you and treat you like a 
thing. I think I'm an intelligent person, 
and the coaches never respected that." 

Taskmaster coaches weren't the only 
thing that made lif<' unpleasant for 
Diana. It was also the fact that he had 
to jump the cultural gap that separated 
football the game from football the 
business. When he left Ivy League 
lootball, Diana was better prepared for 
Yale Med than for the N.F.L. "I never 
felt that I could talk to my teammates. 
There was a certain intellectual curi-
osity that was missing. It was as if they 
came from a different culture. I know 
that sounds bad, but it shouldn't. I'm 
an everyday, ordinary person. I'm not 
an intellectual. My dad repairs TV's." 

The gap between Yale and pro foot-
ball by itself wasn't enough to drive 
Diana away. "It's time for me to start 
leading the kind of life that I want," 
Diana said. "A life in which you do 
things for responsibility's sake. I want 
to have small get-togethers with my 
family and friends, play racquetball 
and improve my golf game." Sitting at 
the table with his light-colored shirt 
neatly tucked into his white sports slacks, 
Diana could be filming a commercial 
for H oliday Country C lub. Ten easy 
steps to become a better family ma n. 

After a year in the pros, D iana re-
mains unfazed by last year's six figure 
income and the diversions such an in-
come allowed. "I've been taken around 
town in a limousine, been to fancy res-
taurants and had front row seats at a 
Broadway show," he said, tiredly re-
counting the list. "I just d idn't find it 
that exciting." Joe Namath would have 
calJed him a bore. 

"Sure the money was nice. I liked 
being able to buy some extra things 
and give some money to my family. 
But I've never had money in my whole 
life. There are more important things. 
My dad never made $20,000 in his life, 
and as a TV repairman I guess he 
never did much to change the world. 
But my parents are good people, and 
good people breed good people." T here 
is more than money, more than family 
pride behind Diana's ambition. He has 
a need to succeed simply because he 
always has. 

''There 1s only so much you can ac-
complish as a player," he said, looking 
out into the living room which doubles 
as a trophy room. "It's like being a n ac-
tor. Sure, I can see the value of enter-
tainment in sports. I enjoy watching
