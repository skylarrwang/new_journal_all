EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Yale College has, no doubt, come a 
long. way from its all-male, mostly-
white, old boy, Northeastern homo· 
geneousness of the fifties and early six-
ties. It has travelled farther still from 
its eighteenth century roots when it 
was founded to provide a more dis-
ciplined, orthodox alternative to H ar-
vard and to provide an atmosphere 
"wherein Youth may be instructed in 
the Arts & Sciences who through the 
blessings of Almighty God may be fit-
ted for Publick employment both in 
Church & Civil State." 

The administration has attempted to 
atone for past sins with affirmative ac-
tion, the admission of women, gener-
ous financial aid and need-blind ad-
m1ss1ons. 

To be sure, the progressive changes 
of recent decades have made the Ivies 
more accessible to \~>right , talented but 
underprivileged youths. Some who 
have benefitted under these programs 
may pursue those liberal causes which 
enabled them to rise to their current 
status. Many others will lose them-
selves amidst the fine print of the class 
notes of the Yalt Alumni Magazint. 

By and la rge, however, the middle 
class, not the lower class, has benefit-
ted most from financial aid programs. 
Instead of only admitting upper mid-
dle class and upper class suburban 
white Anglo-Saxon males, Yale now 
admits upper middle class and upper 
class suburban blacks, Asians and 


women. The odds are still against 
bright, talented, underprivileged 
youths. Their secondary education is 
second-rate. The books which line the 
walls of middle and upper class homes 
are absent from their homes. Their 
parents do not speak the language of 
higher education. Nor are they sold on 
the virtues of the Ivies. While others 
fill their college resumes with stellar ex-
tracurricular activities, these youths 
often spend their afternoons working 
or taking care of the young and old at 
home. 

It is no surprise that prep school 
students are enormously overrepre-
sented at Yale and blacks under-
represented. Yale is not egalitarian, 
nor is it a pure meritocracy. The admit 
rate of alumni children is generally 
more than twice as high as the admit 
rate of applicants whose fathers (or 
mothers as the case may be for some 
grimly precocious adolescents) did not 
attend Yale College. This in spite of 
G iamatti's contention that the "coun-
try's promise that diverse peoples, with 
diverse origins and goals, can compete 
on the basis of merit for the fulfillment 
of their aspirations, is also the basic 
premise of the University's composi-
tion." 

No ·matter how much like-minded 
rhetoric Giamatti produces this year 
and in future years, ivy will still cover 
the walls of Yale, the chimes will still 
sound from Harkness Tower, students 
will still have masters and masters will 
still hold teas. Yale will still be Yale. 
Strip her of her tradition, her elitism 
and her conservatism, and you strip 
her of all that is sacred. You strip her 
of her identity. In spite of the notable 
changes of recent decades, Yale re-
mains one of the great conserving in-
stitutions in America today. It will still 
require a fair amount of ingenuity for 
thoughtful liberals to preserve their 
ideology and the sincerity of their 
beliefs while at Yale .

**Yalies in Hollywood and Beyond**
**Page number(s): 12**

.While Jodie Foster (now shoot-
mg The Hotel New Hampshire with 
Natassia K inski) and j ennifer Beals (of 
F/ashdance fame)" may bt> Yale's best-
known names in Hollywood, there is at 
least one other Yalie who has done 
quite well for himself in the film 
business over the summer. 

His name is J ohn Badham ('61, 
MFA '63). His direction of the summer 
hits WarGames and Blue Thunder have 
brought critical acclaim and, par-
ticularly in the case of WarGames 
financial success. Badham's Masters i~ 
Philosophy has encouraged him to 
think carefully about the moral issues 
inherent in his latest films and about 
the larget and more immediate dan-
gers of nuclear weapons. 

Badham's earlier work was not 
always so serious, though the quality of 
his work has been consistent. H e has 
directed TV shows for Universal in-
cluding The Streets of San Francisco and 
N(ght Gallery, and certainly his best 
known screen work was his direction of 
the now classic Saturday Night Fever. 

"The Last time I acted on stage 
or screen was when I was seven years 
old and played a wooden soldier in a 
school play," said Yale History Pro-
fessor J ohn Blum about his role in 
W oody Allen's latest movie, Zelig. The 
film is about a fictitious chameleon 
character who was one of the most in-
fluential people in the United States in 
the 1920s and 1930s 

"The film is a fake documentary," 
Blum explained. "In the course of it 
Woody Allen uses people who aren't ac-
tors to comment on Zelig. I play 
myself." 

Blum, who claims to be "the least 
well known" of the commentators Allen 
has selected, is certainly renowned on 
the Yale campus. H is courses on 
American public policy draw hun-
dreds each year to listen to his unique 
presentation of history full of anec-
dotes and personal reminiscences. His 
appearance alongside Susan Sontag, 
Saul Bellow and the other commen-
tators in Zelig surprised few who have 
ever attended his often dramatic lec-
tures. 

Yet Blum belittles his acting ability. 
"I'm on the screen for one minute. If 
anything, less. it's a shock to see 
oneself on the sneen, at least for me." 
Blum credits Alkn, not himself, for the 
smoothness of his performance. "Allen 
put me in front of the camera using 
great patience and skill. I think he's ex-
traordinary- absolutely extraor-
dinary." 

Blum's performance opened to rave 
reviews. The Nrw York Times wrote 
that he and the other comm entators 
"revealed a better sense of the absurd 
on screen than they ordinarily do in 
their writing." And maybe even better 
than in lecture.

controversial person named to Presi-
