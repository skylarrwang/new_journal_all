EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Perhaps the most unclear and 
abstract issue relating to the Greek 
system at Yale concerns the impact the 
growth of fraternities will have upon 
the residential college system. While 
many of those in favor of frats contend 
that the college system never worked 
for them, others fear that fraternities 
will threaten to topple the entire 
system. The university has a long-
standing policy of non-interference 
with 
fraternities, 
not working to 
sustain them or to end them. Yet, the 
Yale College Programs of Study states that 
the residential colleges are intended to 
be "more than living quarters; they are 
small communities of men and 
women, whose members know one 
another well and learn from each 
other." If the philosophy behind the 
college system is incompatible with the 
outlook of fraternities, should the 
administrators use their legitimate 
power to protect campus ideals? After 
all, some argue that if Yale were to 
announce a policy prohibiting the 
formation of fraternities, prospective 
students would have the right to apply 
to other colleges where the Greek 
system is considered welcome. 

While they recognize that the college 
system is undergoing a period of 
transition, Yale's administrators 
remain confident. 
"I think 
the 
residential college system runs the 
danger of losing cohesiveness and 
attractiveness," Wilkinson said. "Yet, 
there's a great deal more that can be 
done inÂ·the colleges. We need masters 
and deans with imagination and time 
to serve as facilitators." Dean Suttle 
believes in the ability of Yale students 
and faculty to find alternatives to the 
"beer and tapes" parties of the past. "I 
would be surprised to learn that 
fraternities are any great threat to the 
residential college system. There have 
always been groups of students who 
live off-campus-some 500 each year," 
he explained. "I think the college 
system is a viable, vigorous experience 
that most students will not forego to 
live in a fraternity house on Lake 
Place."
