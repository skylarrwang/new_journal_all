**A Busy School: The Yale School of Drama**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
A busy man: Lloyd Richards, dean or the Drama School and artistic director or the Rep
capacities at the school and the Rep, 
staffing, 
for 
example, the public 
relations and box offices. Rehearsals 
continue into the night, and students 
end one to begin another. 
Finally, there is interest and energy 
enough to put on the weekly Yale 
Cabaret shows, rehearsals for which 
begin at 11 p.m. The Cabaret serves as 
a 
needed release for frustrated 
energies, energies that cannot be 
channeled anywhere else in the school. 
"Things at the Cabaret happen because 
people 
want 
them 
to 
happen," 
explained Brokaw, one of two Cabaret 
artistic directors this year. "There is a 
love and a need for the work, otherwise 
it wouldn't take place. It's too much 
trouble." 

Aside from these daily sacrifices and 
the need for a creative outlet, there are 
problems with YSD's structure. Many 
students feel that they are treated 
poorly at the school. Actors have no 
say in what they are cast in, and rarely 
find out until a day or two before 
rehearsals start. Too many playwrights 
were accepted, leaving some without 
the yearly productions they expected to 
have. Some administration students 
feel like they are used in some positions 
at the Rep to relieve Yale from the 
responsibility of paying full-time staff 
members. The different departments 
tend to be segregated, so politicking 
occurs 
among 
the higher-ups 
enhance the primacy of individual 
departments. And there are many 
complaints raised against specific 
professors and department heads. Such 
talk, sometimes passed over as petty 
gnpmg, 
must be taken seriously. It 
shows the hidden side of YSD's 
contradiction. 

Some of these specific grievances are 
directed at Dean Richards: his hiring 
policies, his Jack of visibility, and, 
more 
recently, 
rumors of his 
opposition to school-wide evaluations. 
He spends a great deal of time away 
from 
the school fund-raising and 
directing productions in Chicago and 
New York. But a larger problem has 
been set heavily on his door-step: the 
conservative trend that the Yale Rep 
has fallen into under his artistic 
direction, and how it affects the school. 

To understand such a trend, one 
must look at the school's innovative 
history. YSD was founded in 1925 
when Edward S. Harkness gave one 
million dollars to create a theater and a 
Department of Drama. The first 
director of the department, George 
Pierce Baker, a former professor of 
English at 
Harvard, 
brought his 
innovative "47 Workshop" with him, 
an experimental program designed for 
new playwrights. 

In 1955, the department became an 
independent graduate school, the Yale 
School of Drama, which would be 
moved to the forefront of theatrical 
innovation during the sixties under 
Dean Robert Brustein. Appointed by 
Kingman Brewster in 1965, Brustein 
came prepared to regenerate YSD, to 
shift it from an academic institution 
into 
professional drama 
training school. He created the Yale 
Repertory Theatre in 1967 as 
something to which his students could 
aspire. The theater soon earned a 
reputation as an 
ideal training 


ground- exciting, experimental, and 
avant-garde. Then, Brustein left Yale 
along with Brewster in 1979. 

· The new President of Yale 
University, A. Bartlett Giamatti, ap-
pointed Lloyd Richards as dean of 
YSD, a position that includes the 
artistic directorship of the Rep. 
Richards, who also acts as the artistic 
director of the Playwrights Conference 
at the Eugene O'Neill Center in 
Waterford, emphasizes the impor-
tance of new 
playwrights' work. 
During his second year at Yale he 
began Winterfest, 
an annual 
presentation of four new plays. 
Occasionally a play by a YSD student 
will be shown, such as this year's Crazy 
From the Heart by third-year playwright 
Edit Villarreal, and Union Boys by 
former YSD student James Yoshi-
mura. 

Richards has 
alsn drawn 
playwrights August Wilson and Athol 
Fugard to the Rep. 

But the Rep relies more heavily now 
on a subscription audience, and many 
students grumble about the "safeness" 
of the shows chosen and presented 
there. 

Though most students 
concurred about the traditionalism 
inherent in today's Rep, only a few 
would talk openly about it. Ellen 
McCartny, a second-year costume 
designer, did all of her work last year 
at the Rep. "I don't see it as the 'Master 
Teacher,'" she said. "I see it as the most 
conservative place on campus. I prefer 
working on the school shows; they're 
all student, and there's a greater sense 
of excitement, a sense of being able to 
take more chances." Paul Selig, a 
third-year playwright, agreed with 
McCartny. 
"It's very conservative 
here, but it's not just the school or the 
Rep," he said. "It's the country. Any 
institution is only as vital as its 
subservient element, and I don't think 
one is in operation here. During 
Brustein's years there was one. The 
Cabaret was wild and dangerous. But 
you can't blame it on Yale." 

Dean Lloyd Richards recognizes 
that students object to the kind of 
artistic link he brings between YSD 
and the R ep. Richards spoke of the 
present conservative trend in both 
institutions, as opposed to Brustein's 
innovation. "Bob was here during his 
time," Richards said tiredly. "That was 
a very different time- a different time 
nationally. He doesn't run ART (the 
American Repetoire Theatre] the same 
way he ran the Yale Rep. The sixties 
were a very revolutionary time. Now, 
we've shifted to a period of less 
ferment." Almost sadly, he added, 
"We're in a transitory time. I can't say 
what the end will be." Then, as though 
he had been asked the question 
countless times before, Richards said, 
"I have not done one thing to be 
different than Bob. I've only done it 
my way." 

Finally, an 
impO£tant physical 
problem concerns YSD's lack of space. 
Headquartered .in 
the University 
Theater (UT) on York Street, the 
Drama School has offices, workshops, 
classrooms, and rehearsal areas in four 
other buildings scattered around 
campus. There is the Yale Rep, 
formerly the Calvary Baptist Church, 
Vernon Hall which houses the Cabaret 
on Park Street, the Drama School 
Annex down a few doors on Park, and 
e some rooms in the 305 Crown Street 
" 
~ building. 
All 
in all, "a motley 
~ assortment of old buildings," as one 
• first-year actor put it. 

~ 
Frank Torok, head of the directing 
} program, takes a stronger view. "The 
-
Yale School of Drama is a 20th century 
i school with 19th century facilities," he 
0 
said. "We seem to be one of the most 
prolific, production-oriented schools in 
the university, and we have no space in 
which to function properly." Some are 
appalled by the surprisingly poor 
workspace; 
most are unhappy. 

Classrooms double as rehearsal halls, 
so no one can use a room to its fullest 
potential. 

A 
long report, 
to be 
submitted to the university, has been 
drawn up department by department, 
calculating how much and what kind of 
space the school has, as compared to 
what it needs. 

On the other hand, the cramped


conditions at YSD can be seen as 
beneficial. After all, 
few 
ideal 
situations exist in the professional 
theater world. "I came here from New 
York," explained Deborah Hecht, 
the speech professor. "This is like 
paradise compared to the space in New 
York. There's never enough space to 
rehearse at any acting school. But 
here, we can practice · our work in 
bigger spaces if we want, and these 
spaces also have a lot of character. If 
the students say anything about it I 
just laugh." 

The contradiction forcefully 
reap-
pears. Students are hesitant to speak 
frankly about their grievances. Partly, 
they are afraid of offending someone 
within their close-knit, professional 
community. But they also don't want 
to mislead; their disenchantment does 
not negate the greatness of YSD. High 
praise still flows easily, even after the 
faults have been discovered. 

Most students are content that they 
chose training school over three years 
in the professional world. They offer a 
variety of reasons, besides the initial, 
logistical ones. Because the school is so 
firmly entrenched in American theater 
and because of the high quality of 
graduates and students, professional 
contacts will be gained. "I would have 
preferred to be locked in a cabin in the 
country," said Phil Stoller, a second-
year playwright. "It's a two-edged 
sword. You meet a lot of interesting 
people who expand your horizons 
here, but you get more work done 
when you're alone. I came here for the 
professional aspects. Yale will help 
separate you from the masses who are
