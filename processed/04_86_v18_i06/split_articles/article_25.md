EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Old Campus and the Yale residential 
colleges are inaccessible to wheel-chair 
users. The only exceptions are 
McClellan Hall on Old Campus, 
Davenport College and Morse 
College. 

Students in wheelchairs 
cannot pick up their mail at Yale 
Station, listen to concerts at Sprague 
Hall, or attend language classes at 
William Harkness Hall. Woodbridge 
Hall, Cross Campus Library, and SSS 
are other frequented buildings at Yale 
that are either completely inaccessible 
by wheel-chair or accessible only via 
complicated routes. 

For wheelchair user Ann Kohanski, 
DC '88, Yale's architectural barriers 
have had serious ramifications. As a 
freshman, she was separated from the 
rest of her class on Old Campus and 
forced to live in Davenport College. 

Each semester Kohanski misses the 
opportunity to explore classes during 
"shopping period" because she must 
submit her schedule one month earlier 
so that her classes can be placed in 
wheel-chair accessible locations. 

Nonetheless, Kohanski is pleased that 
the administration has relocated classes 
and provided other accommodations, 
such as a van equipped with a 
wheelchair lift; 
this service saves 
Kohanski, a Molecular Biophysics and 
Biochemistry major, 
from over-
exerting herself by climbing science 
hill. 

For one disabled student, attending 
Yale has been positive in light of her 
past experiences. Iorijoko, TO '89, sat 
in a large leather armchair overlooking 
the courtyard, her feet barely touching 
the floor. Joko's words sounded 
muffied and unclear due to the cere-
bral palsy that damaged the part of 
Joko's brain that controls movement, 
speech and hearing. A graduate of a 
Catholic boarding school in California, 
Joko has achieved a straight-A record 
during her first year at Yale. Although 
she is from japan, she decided to study 
in the United States because Japan 
lacks academically challenging pro-
grams for the disabled. She also 
believes that attitudes here towards the 
disabled are more tolerant that they 
loriJoko, TD '89, baa learned to deal with her handicap: "I've gotten used to working 
harder to do everything everybody else does with ease."
