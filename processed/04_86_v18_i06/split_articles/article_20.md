It's 1958 and you're a Yale freshman wondering what to do on a 
warm, breezy Friday night. Walking down York Street, you pass the 
Yale Dramat building on your right and impulsively decide to check 
out the off-campus parties. Turning down the path towards "Frat 
Row," you think about all of your friends who were elected to 
fraternities. Activity seems to be going on in all of the luxurious-
looking buildings; lights shine and music can be heard from within the 
frat houses. You remember when you had dinner at Delta Kappa 
Epsilon- the waiters, the huge dining room, the well-stocked bar all 
remain vivid. Maybe I'll join next year, you think as you enter Psi 
Upsilon, immediately recognizing faces and taking a bottle of beer. 
Twenty-five years later, it's 1983. You're a freshman walking back 
from dinner on a Friday night with a few friends, debating what to do. 
You promised to tend bar at Morse-Stiles Casino night; someone else 
votes for the benefit dance in Dwight Hall chapel, and no one wants to 
miss the other SAC party in T.D.- there's supposed to be a great 
grain-alcohol punch. As you smile at each other, deciding to go to all 
three parties, you shake your head, hoping you won't wake up the 
following day with a headache. 

Considering the fact that in the past two years, the number of 
fraternities and sororities at Yale has increased 200 percent, one can 
only guess which experience will be more familiar to next year's 
freshmen, the Class of 1990. There now are eight fraternities at Yale, 
and three more are in the process of establishing themselves on 
campus this semester, an increase which reflects a growing national 
trend. The rise of the legal drinking age and the virtual demise of the 
Social Activities Committee (SAC) appear to be direct causes for the 
recent appeal. While the members of fraternities cite their community 
service projects and their efforts to restructure Yale's ailing social life, 
others fear that the Greek system will cause a fragmentation of student 
life, detracting from Yale's sense of community. Yet, most students 
cannot believe that the Greek system could ever be a threat to the 
social structure at Yale. With approximately 275 students belonging 
to fraternities, it is no longer uncommon, especially as a freshman or 
sophomore, to know several people who belong to Alpha Kappa 
Alpha, Alpha Phi Alpha, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Kappa Sigma, Kappa 
Alpha Theta, Sigma Chi, Sigma Nu, or Zeta Psi. 

Currently each fraternal organization at Yale seems to have its own 
distinct priorities and agenda, though the general structure of each 
appears similar. Most have weekly meetings during which the members 
"Joining was a way of 
defining myself within 
the university as a 
whole. I guess the 
word for it is . 
brotherhood."

address administrative concerns and 
bureaucratic details. Aside from Sigma 
Nu and Zeta Psi, which currently are 
leasing houses on Lake Place, located 
behind Payne-Whitney Gym, the main 
topic of import at each meeting seems 
to be the search for a house or a lodge-
type of social gathering place. Several 
groups involve themselves extensively 
in community service, working with 
the Adopt-a-Grandparent program, 
volunteering at Columbus House, or 
donating food to the Battered Women's 
Shelter. Other fraternities concentrate 
solely on social activites, organiz.ing 
bowling outings, 
cocktail parties, 
poker nights, or trips to other schools. 
A couple have libraries, collecting used 
text books and old exams. 

Fraternity members seem uniformly 
to share the opinion that at Yale, it's 
unrealistic to assume that the Greek 
system will ever dominate a member's 
social life. Pete Smul, MC '87, joined 
Zeta Psi last year after hearing about it 
from his roommate. "Here you can't 
expect 100 percent commitment from 
the members of a frat. You have to 
.. 
~ 
study, go to the gym, and no one wants 
it to encompass their whole life," Smul 
said openly. While intending to live in 
the Zeta Psi house next year, he will 
continue to have a 
Morse meal 
contract. "Fraternities aren't for 
everyone," he admitted. "There are 
5000 
undergrads and 2500 
male 
undergrads- how many can you 
support socially anyway? Yale will be 
overrun by more than 10 frats; there 
just aren't enough guys to fill them." 

Established in the 1850's, Zeta Psi 
has had a chapter at Yale until as

recently as five years ago when a fire 
destroyed its house. In 1984 twelve 
students reestablished a chapter at 
Yale, and now there are 38 members. 
They currently have a three-year lease 
on a house on Lake Place with an 
option to buy. Not knowing any of the 
other members before he rushed, Smul 
is now president and he credits Zeta 
Psi for its diversity. "We have a lot of 
different types of people," he said. 
"There are five football players, five 
baseball, a bunch of tennis players, 
crew jocks, musicians. That's the best 
thing we have to offer: people can get 
out of the habit of just hanging around 
with their teammates."

Despite the recent revitalization of 
fraternities and the ease with which 
they have been formed at Yale, 
obstacles still remain which complicate 
their immediate growth. Establishing a 
fraternal organization usually requires 
little more than writing to the national


chapter, which in turn will provide 
everything from reference manuals to 
representatives who will live in New 
Haven 
to 
help with 
the 
frat's 
organization for the first 
year. 

Fraternities choosing to register with 
the university are treated just like any 
other student organization; they have 
access to space, use of the Yale name, 
and official recognition. Yet, even 
those that are given the use of a room 
on campus for meetings still lack a 
place 
for 
social gathering, 
often 
resorting to Naples, Demery's, or Rudy's. 
Because they are without alumni and 
thus without any financial support, 
fraternities are struggling for funds-
for capital. Not everyone can always 
afford to pay the annual dues, which 
can exceed $150, and those founding a 
frat can pay as much as $500 over two 
years. So fraternity members rely on 
parents, the national chapter of the frat 
as well as their own savings to cover 
the expenses of maintaining a house or 
social activities. 

Although every Yale student has 
their own reasons for joining or not 
joining social societies, the desire to 
feel like part of a group, to find a 
niche, seems to be a common factor. 
Shannon Barr, SY '88, belongs to Sub 
Rosa, an undergraduate organization 
without national affiliation that began 
as a women's companion group to 
Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE); they 
were once known as "DKE's little 
sisters." Sub Rosa has no formal rush 
process; all members are tapped to join 
by 
previous members. 
With 30 
members, the group, which does not 
consider itself a sorority, performs 
community 
service and plans 
sponsor speakers. Having joined last 
October, Barr feels that students are 
searching for a supplement to what 
Yale offers socially. "I've had to deal 
with a lot of friends teasing me about 
the connection with DKE. People 
think that we sit around, drink, and 
talk about football players," Barr said, 
smiling. "It's much 
more than 
that- it's an opportunity to meet more 
women at Yale and get together and 
talk- outside of a college, a sport 
team, or a singing group. It's not a 
whole identity thing but just part of my 
life." 

The history of the Greek system at 
Yale reflects the changing ideological 
trends of the nation, suggesting that 
the current popularity of fraternities at 
Yale may indicate a 
growing 
conservatism within the country as a 
whole-a return to the sensibilities of 
an all-male, racially and culturally 
homogeneous community. With the 
advent of the residential college system 
in 1934, only married students could 
live 
off-campus 
without 
financial 
penalty. Frat«>rnity members had to 
pay for both a meal contract and a 
social activities fee in addition to the 
costs of living off-campus. 

A 
significantly smaller percentage of 
students were on financial aid, so the 
added financial responsibility of living 
in a fraternity house was not a 
deterrent. 

In the late 1950's, fraternities were 
very active at Yale. Students could join 
sophomore year, and virtually every 
fraternity owned its own house. An 
Inter-Fraternity Council composed of 
representatives from each frat also 
existed. "In Silliman it was unusual for 
a classmate in a fraternity to attend a 
social function outside his own group," 
John Wilkinson, Associate Dean and 
Dean of Undergraduate Studies, said. 
"Fraternity Row" was located beyond 
the Daily News offices; the buildings 
now occupied by the Fence Club, the 
Yale Cabaret, and the Afro-American 
Cultural Center were once frat houses. 

As the cost of education increased and 
students became more diverse in terms 
of racial, religious, and socio-economic 
backgrounds, the number of people 
who could afford to join fraternities 
diminished. 

By the 1960s, most of the advising 
and counseling took place in the 
residential colleges, and there had been 
a dramatic growth of the civil rights 
movement. Students' identification 
with the colleges grew and their desire 
to become involved with fraternity life 
lessened. With the increased use of 
illicit drugs, the popularity of alcohol 
and fraternity bars also declined. Some 
Yale fraternities belonged to national 
chapters which either blatantly or 
subtly discriminated on the basis of 
race, religion, or ethnicity. When 
Saint Anthony 
Hall, 
traditionally 
known as a non-social or "literary" 
fraternity, was the first fraternity to tap 
a black undergraduate, the St. A's 
chapter from the Univerity of Virginia 
picketed at Yale. When Yale fraternity 
chapters refused to discriminate, they 
gradually lost the financial support and
