A Time for Conversation
Time for you and time for me, And time yet for a hundred 
indecisions, And for a hundred visions and revisions, Before 
the taking of a toast and tea. 
-T.S. Eliot

Afterthought? Not in an Epimethean sense, I trust. The 
years as Master have not prepared me for afterthoughts, 
especially not while the "after," though imminent, still lies 
ahead. But I welcome the invitation to comment on an 
aspect of the experience. 

As an 
experiment 
in education outside the 
classroom- a frequently unobtrusive education that 
occurs in a dazzling range of modes and contexts- the 
residential colleges represent an indubitable success. The 
greatest achievement of the colleges is, however, also their 
most fragile and endangered. I don't mean out-celebrated 
specimens of architectural 
mimesis, 
but cultural 
intercourse and intellectual discourse. 

Twenty-five years ago Richard B. Sewall, professor of 
English and the distinguished first Master of Ezra Stiles 
College, said: "This . . . is the noblest work of these 
colleges: to facilitate conversation- the meeting of mind 
with mind, person with person. Young with young, old 
with old, and (hardest of all) young with old." This 
"noblest work" of the colleges is their most fragile 
tradition. When not tactfully nurtured, it withers faster 
than most other features of the system. 

Conversation of "young with old" and "old with old" 
(the "old" often being quite young) in the colleges is not in 
a phase of high energy or high art. Over the last two 
decades, conversations between faculty fellows and 
students, and fellows and fellows, 
have dwindled 
drastically. In the fall of 1965, 637 fellows took 19,896 
meals in the twelve colleges; in the fall term of 1985, only 
416 fellows took a mere 2,466 meals in the colleges-a 
decrease of 87.6 percent in these opportunities for 
informal interaction between faculty and students, faculty 
and faculty, in our colleges. (Occasionally we recuperate 
fragments of what we've lost: I treasure, for example, the 
weekly Monday lunches of the Ezra Stiles faculty Fellows, 
at which we take turns giving informal talks about our 
research.) Even more disheartening are the statistics for 
junior faculty: a decrease of 95.44 percent from 1965 to 
1985 in college meals taken by junior faculty. This is but 
one way of quantifying the massive withering of a faculty 
presence in the colleges. 

The intellectual and social texture of our residential 
college communities has suffered accordingly. Informal 
cross-disciplinary exchange between faculty, though it 
continues in other, more structured forums, 
has 
diminished, and our mission of facilitating, inter alia, the 
more difficult kind of conversation, of old with young, has 
been significantly hobbled. 

The reasons for the reduced faculty presence in the 
colleges probably are numerous, and I who live in the fifth 
century B.C. -a mere visitor in the twentieth-won't 
pretend to fathom them. The reduction and then, in 
1980, elimination of college meal privileges for faculty 
played a role, but I suspect a more complex process of 
alienation has been at work, especially in the lives of 
junior faculty. President Giamatti and Provost Brainard 
deserve the warmest thanks of all who care about the 
colleges and about intellectual exchange at Yale for their 
recent decision to restore limited meal privileges to Yale 
College junior faculty, effective next fall. It is a significant 
exhortation. But it should be only the beginning of a 
multi-dimensional and, indeed, daunting, yet necessary, 
process of social and intellectual recuperation- necessary, 
if the colleges are to realize more fully their extraordinary 
potential. 

I hasten to affirm that the "conversation of young with 
young" in the colleges is flourishing. I suspect the students 
don't need help, but like others I have tried to flood Ezra 
Stiles with a variety of shared cultural experiences, and to 
encourage intellectual, artistic, and personal exploration 
within the discreet, supportive, informality of our college 
community. Even the trifling domesticities we foster-a 
shared cup of coffee, 
the casual studybreak 
exchange- seem to help weave contexts hospitable to the 
sharing of those hundred indecisions, visions, and 
revisions. 

Occasionally our larger college community too realizes 
much of its potential, and when it does, Diotima's 
response to Socrates' question, "What, then, is eros?" 
appears to be instantiated multiplicatively: "Eros is 
something that interprets (hermmeuon) and ferries back 
and forth ... and, being an intermediary between two, 
eros fully fills both, so that in itself all is bound together 
. . . and through it all social intercourse and all 
conversation exist . . . . " 

"Master" often is but a euphemistic metaphor for 
"slave," but the continuing, though embattled presence of 
conversation in the colleges has allowed my service 
(servitium > serous) to be aptly described by Plato's 
oxymoron 
l. coinage dhekl-douleio., "voluntary slavery." 

The remarkable students and fellows of the college have 
thoroughly ensured that my service was animated not 
only by joy and love, but above all by a steady, though far 
from metrical, pulse of enriching conversations. I 
fervently hope this fragile joy will be vigorously protected 
and tactfully nurtured and enhanced by our institution.

years as Master of Ezra Stiles College.
