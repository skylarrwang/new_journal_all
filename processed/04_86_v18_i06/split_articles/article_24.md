If you smile at Elizabeth Shieldkret, 
CC '88, when you pass her in the 
street, don't be offended if she doesn't 
smile back. Shieldkret hasn't snubbed 
you, she just hasn't seen you. When 
people greet her, she admitted, "I 
recognize them from their voices, not 
their faces." At first glance Shieldkret 
looks like any other knapsack-carrying 
student on campus, wearing a sweater 
and jeans. But if you look closely you 
might notice that behind the thick, 
rose-tinted lenses and bifocals of her 
glasses, Shieldkret's brown eyes aren't 
focusing directly on anything. Most 
people don't look closely, however, so 
when Shiedkret tells people that she's 
legally blind, they're usually surprised. 
"I always tell them jokingly, 'Don't set-
tle for imitations, because there are il-
legally blind people out there,'" she ex-
plained. Turned pensively towards the 
sky she added, "Sometimes they even 
seem shocked and pull away; it takes 
them a while to get used to the idea 
that I am a handicapped person. While 
J>e<>ple at Yale are growing more aware 
of the problems of blacks and gays and 
Other minorities on campus because of 
all the organizations, forums and 
publicity, I don't think most people 
even realize that there are also disabled 
people here." 


Last November Shieldkret and other 
members of the Yale community 
gathered in the new Resource Office 
for Students with Disabilities located 
on Wall Street. They were there to 
form an organization that finally gave 
voice to the 19 disabled students on 
campus. While particular disabilities 
of the students at the meeting ranged 
from dyslexia to deafness to muscular 
dystrophy, each one shared a desire to 
have the buildings on campus made 
physically accessible and to provide the 
general Yale population with 
information on 
the 
handicapp~d. 
They also desired to have recreational, 
academic and cultural programs made 
fully available to them- those same 
programs that non-disabled students 
take for granted. Hence, members at 
the meeting embraced Shieldkret's sug-
gestion that the organization be called 
EASY or Equal Access for Students at 
Yale. 


"Our motto is, 'A disability does not 
have to be a handicap,'" said Rosette 
Liberman, shaking her head. As 
Assistant Director of the Resource 
Office 
for 
Disabilities, 
Liberman 
brings the same idealistic fervency to 
the cause of the disabled that she once 
gave to the Civil Rights Movement 
during the 1950's. "The word 'handi-
cap' has negative connotations implying 
limitations," Liberman said. 
She 
believes 
that 
student 
insens1t1vtty 
towards the physically d isabled is 
rooted in ignorance, and that once 
they are made more aware, the non-
disabled will become more helpful and 
cooperative. 


At the meeting, Liberman proposed 
that increased awareness of the dis-
abled on campus would also encourage 
Yale administrators to accelerate and 
expand their existing programs. In en-
thusiastic agreement, several students 
began speaking at once, debating the 
utility of table tents, posters and bake-
sales to promote awareness. "Excuse 
me, everyone," interrupted Dean Rita 
Brackman, who, as Chairperson of the 
University Advisory Committee for 
Disabilities, has already been sensi-
tized to the problems of the disabled. 
"Everyone, please talk facing Mary 
Schulze, who's deaf and reads lips." 
Brackman went on to explain the ad-
ministration's policy. "We are address-
ing as many aspects of disabled

School. Yet, once he arrived on

started using a wheelchair three years 
ago after he began law school at the 
University of Cahtorma. "Most 
mobility-disabled don't apply to Yale 
because there are just too many 
architectural barriers and bad 
weather," said H eaton, unfolding his 
arms for a moment to reveal the word 
"California" on his orange t-shirt. 
"Instead, they go to college campuses
