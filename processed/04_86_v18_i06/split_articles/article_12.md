EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Three Yale freshmen, David Jones, Robert Proud, and  Rajiv Singh, have combined their talents to form Compuform, Inc., a rapidly growing computer services company.  Initially, the three considered providing services to the Yale campus.  However, they ultimately decided to focus on off-campus ventures.  About halfway through their first semester, they incorporated in Connecticut and leased office space on Lake Place.


Their company now provides a range of computer services, including word processing, data analysis for corporations, and the sale of hardware and software to law offices and medical practices.  The students themselves typically install the hardware, primarily IBM personal computers, and coordinate the software systems.  They are also developing a system to allow them to create their own hardware and software on contract for larger firms.


While the students are not disclosing their company's current financial success, they have plans to invest dividends exceeding $50,000 in projects such as developing a simulated mainframe computer.  They currently employ five or six part-time student workers and have an accountant and a lawyer.  Despite their entrepreneurial endeavors, the three freshmen emphasize that their primary focus remains on their studies and that Compuform's connection to Yale is coincidental. They maintain a balance between their business and their academic lives.
