Although rarely acknowledged or recognized, 19 disabled students currently attend 
Yale. The opening of the Resource Office for Students with Disabilities and the 
formation of their own student organization reflect the desire of the disabled to 
knock down those barriers which have prevented them from entering the college 
community with ease. By Jennifer Lee.
