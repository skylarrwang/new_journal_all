trying to do what you are trying to do." 
Also, the students themselves are 
unanimously seen as YSD's greatest 
asset. Faculty members view their 
pupils in many cases as their peers. An 
air of professionalism exists among the 
students that commands the respect of 
all who are associated with the school. 
Hecht explained, "If you take 
people- actors, playwrights, design-
ers-who have a dream about some-
thing they love, and you throw them 
into a space with a few theaters, then 
it'll be like children in a sandbox with 
some toys. They're going to make 
something wonderful." 
Despite dissatisfaction with some 
professors, many members of the 
faculty are heralded by students who

mentors on the teaching staff of YSD. 
Such notable professionals as designer 
Ming Cho Li and lighting designer 
Jennifer Tipton are in the staff ranks. 
And the Rep provides well-respected 
directors, actors, playwrights and 
other production people from outside 
YSD who come to New Haven to work 
on its six yearly shows. 
YSD, then, is not what it appears to 
be. Its inherent contradiction disrupts 
the gleaming surface. Yet despite the 
recent eruption of discontentment,

to the limit," said first-year actor Bruce 
Katzman. "It's like doing a triple flip 
on a trapeze: when you fall there are 
nets everywhere so you won't be afraid 
to try again." Then, suddenly, "This 
place is heaven to me. That's what I've 
been writing to all my friends." 
Katzman talked of his experience in 
the professional world before Yale. 
"My first two years in New York I only 
studied. The next three I 
mixed 
studying with trying to get a job. I was 
fairly unsuccessful. I couldn't get an 
agent. I couldn't seem to get in 
anywhere. I felt desperate for a place to 
work." So Katzman applied, got 
accepted, and made the decision to 
come to Yale. "I'm 33," he said. "I had 
a pretty settled life in New York. I had 
a real nice apartment. T his is a big 
change, and a lot of money. I'm going 
to be 36 when I get out of here. I don't 
know what kind of pay-off I'll get."
