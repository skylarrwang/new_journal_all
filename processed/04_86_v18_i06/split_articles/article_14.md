Without the Make-up 
It is nearly impossible for an outsider 
to enter the jumbled world of Yale's 
drama school. Professors say more in 
pauses than in words. Students are 
wary, awkwardly talking "off the 
record." Everyone knowingly speaks in 
cliches. Such indirectness simply 
heightens the monolith"ic reputation 
that shrouds the school. The Yale 
School of Drama (YSD) is great, 
everyone seems to know, too great 
honestly to slander. So here's our 
brochure: Read between the lines. 
Or be patient. Look upon YSD as a 
jigsaw puzzle. Carefully assemble the 
pieces of formal text and inside voices, 
of blustery complaints and candid 
information. The final picture will not 
match the perfect one painted on the 
box. And every insider knows it. 
But the quietude resounds sharply. 
Why do they refrain from offering the 
truest Â· tale? YSD indeed has an 
incredible reputation. Students apply 
en masse. But those accepted quickly 
discover the underlying troubles, 
realizing how the 60-year-old school 
operates. There is the invariable 
naivete, the inevitable disenchant-
ment. 

Throughout, 
they remain 
cautious. YSD is, after all, a tight 
community, and professionally well-
connected. A telling paranoia reigns. 
Don't rock the boat; don't quote me. 
That is, until December. Patience 
paid off. Organized unhappiness 
emerged, marring perfection, when a 
group of YSD students banded 
together to air specific complaints. 
Frustration that had been building for 
one, 
two, 
three years exploded 
spontaneously in demands for 
recognition. Roughly 25 students from 
various departments met before winter 
break, informally calling themselves 
the "Committee of Concerned 
Students." Each department had 
unique grievances, but several over-all 
problems were distinguished. There 
was a feeling among the group that 
YSD lacked visible, central leadership. 
Students were being treated poorly by 
the Administration but were without 
an organized or official voice. "I don't 
know what goes on up there," said one 
third-year student. "All I see is the 
chaotic result." 

A survey was made up and delivered 
to the entire student body. Around 87 
percent filled it out, and the results are 
startling. There were strong indica-
tions that Dean Lloyd Richards does 
not have enough contact with the 
students. The questionaire also showed 
considerable disgruntlement with the 
faculty. These findings were hand 
delivered to Richards before the winter 
break by members of the unofficial 
"Committee," along with a request that 
he formally respond. 

In January Richards did respond by 
calling the entire school to a meeting in 
the University Theater. Stressing his 
accomplishments as dean, pointing out 
that his job concerns the school's 
budget, Richards talked truthfully 
about the financial success of his 
administration. One student said the 
talk was "a bit of an apology" for not 
being around. Then, in the last minute 
before leaving the stage, he announced 
that he would meet with two repre-
sentatives from each class, department 
by department. So far, the stage 
managers, directors, and playwrights 
have talked privately with him. 

Through a series of often confused 
meetings, on one occasion attended by 
65 students, three concrete goals were 
decided on by the Committee: a 
school-wide system of teacher evalu-
ations, a student government, and 
more visible leadership. But students 
find it difficult to decide whether these 
aims, if achieved, will improve the 
quality of thei.r training. 

Although the Committee has since 
disbanded, more formal and indus-
trious meetings began to occur among 
the departmental representatives. The 
Committee's desire 
for a 
student 
government was seen by some as 
impractical. The students' work-load 
has also increased since December, 
and many are now content to wait for 
the meetings' results, which are by no 
means guaranteed. 

So finally, we are left with a simple 
contradiction: apparent perfection 
masking tacit institutional problems. 
The good, the reasons for attending 
YSD, readily distinguishes itself. The 
bad must be sorted out, 
petty 
complaint from 
structural failure. 
Students recognize the contradiction. 
They have a lot at stake. So, while 
hungrily gulping rewards , 
or 
struggling with grievances, 
they 
question whether YSD, the good and 
the bad, is worth the time, 
the 
professional set-backs, 
and the 
expense. They answer, "Yes," or, "I'll 
know after graduation." But no matter 
how quietly, YSD students do ask the 
question, and, as the December Group 
shows, they now feel strongly enough 
to attack the imperfect side of YSD. 

To understand the contradiction, one 
m ust first recognize the glittering 
attraction of the school, the flawless 
exterio r . 
Graduates from YSD 
constantly appear in the spotlight: 
M eryl Streep, 
H enry Winkler, 
Sigourney Weaver, Albert Innaurato. 
From the outside, it would seem that 
Y ale can create super-stars. 

Organizationally, YSD is unique. 
"Yale is one of the few schools in the 
country where an effort is made to 
provide training for all aspects of the 
theater," said Earle Gister, associate 
dean and 
professor of acting. "A 
replica of the real world is created." 
The school offers training in eight 
d i fferent departments: 
acting, 
di recting, 
d esign, dramat urgy, 
playwritin g, stage management, 
technical design and production 
(TD&P), and theater administration. 

Also, unlike other drama schools, YSD 
promises 
direct 
contact with 
a 
respected regional theater, the Yale 
Repertoire Theatre (Rep). Called the 
"Master Teacher" by administrators, 
the Rep should present a model and 
provide a professional laboratory for 
Yale students. 

Before arriving, new students don't 
see the internal problems and don't 
expect any disappointment. They do 
know that YSD is one of the most 
compet1t1ve drama schools in the 
nation. For example, 1332 men and 
women applied for entry this past fall. 
Seventy-seven, or 5.8 percent, were 
accepted. "Before I got to Yale," said 
30 year-old David Wayne Nelson, a 
third-year actor, "I was expecting 
Shangri-la. I thought the drama school 
would be all I ever dreamed of. I was 
very frightened and, at the same time, 
felt very unworthy." The school offers 
only good, if one can believe statistics 
and a reputation 60 years in the 
making. And one must believe, if one 
plans to attend. A lot will be given up 
in three years. 

Students pay approximately $12,500 
each year for tuition and living 
expenses. Since most are on financial 
aid, they will have large debts to pay 
back after entering the financially 
unpromising theatrical profession. 
Also, students sacrifice three years out 
of their professional careers to learn in 
a school what many believe only the 
real world can teach. The average age 
of a student at YSD is 27; only one 
student was accepted in 1985 directly 
from college. Yale, applicants believe, 
will ultimately benefit them more than 
their current professional paths. 

But d isillusionment occurs after 
arriving in New Ha{ren; these initial 
sacrifices become increasingly im-
portant. T he contradiction begins to 
form in students' minds as they 
recognize the realities of YSD. It is a 
three-year professional training school, 
and training schools don't inject talent, 
they improve technique. "Before I 
came here, 'Yale' was a magic word," 
said second-year actor Patrick Kerr, 
sitting behind a desk in YSD's third-
floor library. "Anyone who came to the 
drama school was a star and would 
work all the time when they got out. 
That's a bunch of garbage. People who 
leave here aren't golden; they're going 
to have to struggle to make it in 
professional theater like anyone else." 

Demands on YSD students' time 
begin with classes, which generally run 
between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. Apart from 
class, homework must be completed: 
models built, papers and plays written, 
scenes rehearsed and re-rehearsed. In 
the afternoon, work on the various 
school and Rep productions begins. 
Sets are constructed on the mainstage 
for third-year directing projects, such 
as the recent Big Divinity and 
Waterstown Primary; props are gathered 
and costumes sewn for the various 
"Drama 50's," short original pieces 
collaborated on by 
all 
first-year 
students from 
every department. 
Administration students work in many
