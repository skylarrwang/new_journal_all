In recent years, the number of applicants to writing courses at Yale has far 
surpassed available openings. Questioning academia's tendency to equate criticism 
with art, critical thinking with reactive thinking, the author finds that today's 
students are searching for a new means of self-expression. By Donald W. 
Faulkner who teaches in the Yale English Department.
