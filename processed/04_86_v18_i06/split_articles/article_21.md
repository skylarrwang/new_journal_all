subsidization of the nationals, and one 
by one they began to close. "They 
couldn't afford to keep house. It's 
expensive to maintain a dining room, 
bar, bartender, waiters, and pay 
property taxes. They were dead, long 
before the drinking age moved from 21 
to 18," Wilkinson explained. "The 
paradox is that the new move of the 
drinking law gave them life again." 

Several factors have combined to 
create an ideal climate for fraternities 
to grow, though administrators and 
students alike attest to the fact that the 
change in the legal drinking age is 
perhaps the clearest and most glaring 
reason for the resurgence at Yale. In 
1983, Ronald Reagan successfully 
appealed for cooperation to end the 
"crazy quilt" of different states' 
drinking laws. 
He then 
signed 
legislation that would deny Federal 
highway funds to states that kept the 
drinking age under 21 , praising the 
"great national movement to raise the 
drinking age." College administrators, 
including those at Yale, sympathized 
with efforts to decrease the growing 
number of alcohol-related car 
accidents among 
the college-age 
population. Yet, now they're saddled 
with laws which may be as difficult to 
enforce as prohibition was in the 
country as a whole. Only 25 percent of 
Yale students are oflegal drinking age, 
and in order for a student organization 
to serve alcohol at SAC parties, police 
officers as well as university-approved 
bartenders must be hired. 

Wilkinson feels torn between his 
responsibility as administrator and his

recogmt10n of the realities of social 
psychology. "We don't want to be in a 
position where we as an institution 
encourage the violation of the law. I 
think this is a challenging time to 
figure out ways to make college 
functions varied and interesting," he 
said. "On the other hand, I worry 
about a society which tries to prohibit 
things which 
are attractive to 
a 
majority of people." He rubbed his 
brow. "I understand why the legal 
drinking age has been raised. I just 
wish that when the age was at 18, it 
had been enforctd- but that's just one 
voice crying in the wilderness." 

"Fraternities sell themselves with the 
notion that they are places where you 
can come and drink. I'm concerned 
about the legal liability and financial 
liability of this," J. Lloyd Suttle, 
Associate Dean and Dean of Admin-
istrative and Student Affairs , 
emphasized, looking harried. "lfl were 
an officer in a fraternity, I'd be scared 
to death of what might happen when a 
group of freshmen gets quite drunk 
and leaves Lake Place at all hours of 
the morning. What's the risk of a 
drunk freshman getting hit by a car on 
Elm Street? It'll take only ont incident." 

He paused. "Who's going to 
be 
responsible? I can warn them, but I 
can't control them." 

The adverse effects of the Local 34 
strike last fall also have contributed to 
the recent popularity of the Greek 
system at Yale. For the Class of '88, 
who were freshmen during last year's 
strike, their first semester at Yale was 
one characterized by a 
lack 
of 
operating dining halls; no meals were 
served at Commons or within the 
colleges, preventing freshmen from 
meeting each other easily. Because of 
the lack of organized social activites, 
few bonds were formed with people 
from other residenftal colleges. This 
situation 
resulted 
in 
divisive 
freshman year for many students, 
creating a sense of social isolation 
which was magnified by the absence of 
a central student facility at Yale. 

The growing conservative trend in 
the nation has also added to the 
resurgence. Today some long to return 
to the period before the political 
turmoil of the late 60's, when socially-
oriented fraternal groups thrived and 
students were not publicly demon-
strating and confronting moral and 
ethical issues. One fraternity member 
commented, "The trend of people 
wanting to be super-radical, liberal, 
and non-conformist is fading." 

Disillusioned with the social life and 
the college system, Marco Rosen-
baum, TC '88, and David Hogg, TC 
'88, were looking for an alternative 
when 
they decided 
to 
begin a 
fraternity . "I had envisioned this great, 
tradition-oriented school: 
cocktail 
parties, chummy brotherhood, road-
trips. That fits my idea of what Yale 
should be like," explained H ogg with a 
thick South Carolinian accent. A 
reproduction of Picasso's Guemica 
hangs above the fireplace of their living 
room in Trumbull. "We want to get 
back to 'Old Yale,'" Rosenbaum, who 
grew up in Texas, added. "Traditions, 
rituals, breaking down into social

groups- I like that sort of cliquish 
atmosphere. 
Fraternities can 
only 
enhance that." 

Rosenbaum, Treasurer, and H ogg, 
Pledge Trainer, 
are among the 
founders of the Yale chapter of Sigma 
Chi as well as active Political Union 
members. 
Founded in 
1855 and 
formally reestablished at Yale this 
semester, Sigma Chi presently has 
thirteen members and five more to be 
inducted. Not wanting to threaten the 
residential college system, 
the 
fraternity currently has no plans for 
establishing an ofT-campus house. 

While both feel that the university is 
failing to provide alternatives which 
will restructure the campus social life, 
Rosenbaum and Hogg also realize that 
Yale's laissez-faire attitude has no 
guarantees. "If Benno Schmidt and 
John Wilkinson decide that fraternities 
aren't good, then they'll just start 
pressuring us ofT," Rosenbaum said, 
smoking a Marlboro. "They could 
easily drive us underground. All it will 
take is someone getting hurt or just one 
person who's rejected from a fraternity 
and can prove it was due to some form 
of discrimination ." Yale's tacit 
acceptance of the growth of the Greek 
system 
seems uncharacteristic to 
Rosenbaum. "I'm surprised that no 
one's demonstrated at all. 
The 
Women's Center seems to be very low-
key about frats." He paused. "You 
know, the argument of sexism is 
perfectly valid- sororities are sexist 
and fraternities are sexist." 

The desire to begin new traditions at 
Yale has led women as well as blacks to 
create and form fraternal organizations 
of their own. Julie Heller, PC '88, 
sa!d, 
"I believe 
in the 
feminist 
movement, but Yale is still in many 
ways a man's school; there are no 
traditions 
for 
women here." Her 
roommate, Miriam He~an , PC '88, is 
president of Kappa Alpha Theta. 

"People always see fraternities as a 
breaking apart, but it really pulls 
people together," she said. "You can't 
just have a big beer party anymore. 
Now everything's underground, and 
that's added to the fragmentation of the 
colleges, not fraternities." 

Founded in 1870 by a group of 
women at DePaul University, Kappa 
Alpha Theta represents the United 
States' first "women's fraternity," a title 
originally created because the term 
"sorority" had not yet been in use. 
Established in September at Yale by a 
group of sophomore women, Kappa 
Alpha Theta now has 10 members and 
14 pledges. Last semester a Theta 
m ember and graduate of Washington 
State University lived in New Haven 
solely for the purpose of acting as the 
Yale chapter's consultant. 

One entire wall in Heller's living 
room is plastered with photos of 
men-everyone from James Dean to 
Paul Newman. A Yale banner hangs 
over the fireplace and a Gone with the 
Wind poster adorns another wall with a 
small television set nearby. With both 
brothers in fraternities, Heller had 
always maintained a stereotyped view 
of sororities. But last spring when two 
of her close friends began the process of 
starting a sorority, she decided to give 
it a chance. "For me, it was a shock to 
move into the college after freshman 
year- it's sort of isolating," Heller 
said. "But in Theta, we've got a 
member from Lima, Peru and one 
from Lima, Ohio." 

Kappa Alpha Theta reflects the 
changing image of college sororities in 
the U.S. Increasingly becoming career-
minded, sororities are concentrating 
on establishing professional networks 
to help their members enter and 
advance in their chosen fields following 
graduation. Partly as a result, they've 
been able to attract record numbers of 
Julie Heller, PC '88, and Miriam Herman, PC '88, founded Kappa Alpha Theta with 
a desire to begin traditions for women at Yale.
