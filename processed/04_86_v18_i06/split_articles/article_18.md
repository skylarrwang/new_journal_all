"Five years ago, the 
city had declined so 
much that the new 
administration's 
emphasis was on 
'getting something , 
anything, going.'" 
little has been done in the past or is 
being . done now 
for 
low-income 
housing. For these reasons, among 
others, the city has been criticized by 
local press, aldermen, and government 
officials. The city's theory of 
development appears to be a "trickle 
down" system of economic growth, 
emphasizing big business, 
private 
developers and private money as a 
way of boosting New Haven's 
economy. 

"We have a vision of New Haven and 
wher"e it can go in the future," said 
William Ginsberg, head of the city's 
Development Administration, a posi-
tion appointed by Mayor Biagio 
DiLieto. "We have a way to add to its 
economic base and its image of itself." 
Described by some as the mayor's 
"right hand man," Ginsberg wields a 
great deal of influence as coordinator 
for the three major aspects of the city's 
development- economic, housing 
and downtown/harbo""r de~-elOpment: ·-
Ginsberg, a man who is regarded by 
his associates as capable, intelligent, 
and concerned, speaks with authority 
and confidence about the vision he 
maintains. "More and more as New 
Haven evolves, I personally see a city 
that is urban in the sense that it is a 
regional center. It needs a strong 
pedestrian life, stressing residential as 
well as work areas. It must have things 
which draw people here- entertain-
ment, culture, commercial office 
space, and the complicated networks of 
strong neighborhoods and loyal family 
businesses, all of which add towards its 
rejuvenation." 

But Ginsberg's vision depends on a 
relationship between government 
officials and private developers- a 
dynamic of progress which did not 
exist twenty years ago. Then, the 
agenda for change was set almost 
entirely by a dialogue between the city 
government and the public. But the 
city's attempts to modernize brought 
fittle improvement. In fact, in its 
efforts 
to encourage growth, 
the 
government built the Oak Street 
intersector in 1959. An extension of 
U.S. 95, it cut straight into th~ heart of 
the city and destroyed many of the old, 
ethnic neighborhoods. According to 
Ginsberg, before DiLieto took office 
five years ago the city had dedined so 
much that the new administration's 
emphasis was on "getting something, 
anything, going." It was then that the 
city turned to large private developers 
as the solution to its problems, and .the 
dialogue between the government and 
the public disappeared. With a sound 
economy and a construction boom, the 
New Haven government is now in an 
advantageous position. Not only can 
the city entice developers with tax 
breaks, mortgage delays, and federal 
loans, but it is able to select those 
developers from a ve_ry competitive 
market. 

New Haven has utilized 
local 
developers such as the 
Fusco 
Corporation to build the Long Wharf 
Maritime Center and the Schiavone 
Corporation to renovate the theater 
district. It has also lured a well-known 
developer of office towers in downtown 
Manhattan 
to 
construct 
government complex. David Chase 
with the Olympia-York Corporation, 
one of the largest developers in North 
America, is in charge of building a new 
City Hall and adjacent 25 story office 
tower on the site where the Powell 
Building currently stands. Containing 
420,000 square feet of retail office 
space, the tower will become the 
largest building in downtown New 
Haven. 

Despite the advantages of a sound 
economy and a 
competent, 
well-
respected developer, construction of 
the government complex suffered a 
setback, 
indicative 
of a 
problem 
inherent in the city's new development 
approach. 

Chase 
was obliged to 
postpone the demolition of the Powell 
Building, which originally 
was 
scheduled for last year, when he was 
unable to secure guarantees from 
businesses to occupy the tower's space. 
Especially for a building as large as the 
proposed tower, a developer must be 
assured of a large occupancy prior to 
constructing it which will generate 
enough 
revenues to pay for the 
building and make the developer's 
investment worthwhile. 

New City Hall has been in the works 
for decades, but the office tower is a 
recent addition to the pr~ject. The 
City Hall alone will cost 15 million 
dollars in public funds to build. 
Because building just a city hall would 
not allow developers to make a profit, 
the city suggested that potential 
developers build an additional office 
tower which will cost 70 million dollars 
through private financing. Such an 
investment scheme attracted a large 
developer like Chase-Olympia/York, 
which has agreed to build City Hall at 
cost for the government. 

The difficulties that Chase 
encountered in attracting occupants 
for the office tower illustrate the central


Many officials on the city's planning 
boards see office space as the key to 
New Haven's economic success and 
growth. Both officials and developers 
believe that the construction of retail 
office space will generate revenues for 
the city's economy as well as attract 
outside industries to locate in New 

But 
many others are 
concerned that New Haven might be 
over-building and creating more office 
space than can be filled since the city 
already contains over 250,000 square 
feet of empty office space. 

Ironically, 
most of the 
tower's 
potential occupants were being lured to 
the Long Wharf Maritime Center, 
another office building project 
sponsored by the city. In essence, New 
Haven was promoting two major 
developments of retail office space at 
the same time which competed for the 
same limited 
business 

Nonetheless, Ginsberg maintains that 
the two projects attract completely 
different types of clientele and in 
theory should not compete with one 
another. 

Furthermore, he believes that the 
office glut will not hinder future 
growth · but encourage it. "If you 
assume that existing patterns of filling 
office space will continue, there is no 
good justification for what we are 
doing. It would take years to fill these 
projects. They are all risky, but we 
hope that office trends will change. 
Those trends haven't hit New Haven 
yet but there are a lot of things that 
make New Haven attractive and we 
feel our time has come." He believes 
that such a development program wili 
attract 
major companies 
New 
Haven and generate jobs and 
revenues. But so far developers have 
only been successful in relocating New 
H aven companies to different places in
