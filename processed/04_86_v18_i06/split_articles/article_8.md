Going Underground 
In 1961, Yale prepared for nuclear 
holocaust. K-Rations consisting of 
Spam, a pressed fruitbar, a piece of 
chocolate, powdered coffee, and 
cigarettes were stored in underground 
cages. Large bins of water were also 
placed in basements and underground 
steam tunnels. 

Sleeping pills and 
barbiturates were provided with the 
expectation that people might be so 
distraught they would need them to 
sleep and relax. The shelters and 
emergency supplies were never used, 
nor were they removed; they remain as 
Yale's legacy of the paranoia in the 
early 60's. 

With tension 
in Berlin and a 
looming crisis in Cuba, President 
Kennedy set the country in panic by 
encouraging the building of fallout 
shelters. Like most cities across the 
country, 
New Haven followed 
Kennedy's advice and developed a 
Civil Defense Agency to prepare for 
nuclear war. Yale, also, was caught in 
the tide, and appointed its own civil 
defense program in cooperation with 
the city's. 

Colonel Richard Gimbel, '20, the 
curator of the aeronautical literature 
collection at Sterling Library, chaired 
the Yale Civil Defense Committee. 
The plan was to provide protection for 
the entire Yale community from 
nuclear fallout in the basements and 
the underground steam tunnels. 
Radiation detection instruments, 
emergency lighting, heat, and 
communication were to be provided in 
addition to emergency supplies. The 
scheme included making various 
structural changes in the basements 
and tunnels in order to increase their 
effectiveness as fallout shelters: 
openings were to be blocked, walls 
reinforced, and ventilation shielded 
from radiation. The committee based 
its efforts on several assumptions 
which 
served 
to 
rationalize 
the 
existence of the shelters. One was that 
the attack would not be a direct hit- it 
was thought that New York City or 
Boston would be primary targets. 

Secondly, they hoped that the winds 
would 
be 
favorable 
so 
fire 
and 
radiation would not be swept directly 
toward New Haven. 

But even if these assumptions were 
proven to be accurate, the committee 
still 
oversimplified 
the effects of 
nuclear war and overlooked major 
complications. Many of the structural 
changes were never carried out, and as 
a result the underground network 
provided insufficent protection from 
nuclear fallout. And even if the shelters 
had been safe, the supplies would have 
lasted only two 
weeks. 

Other 
expectations were 
unrealistic: 
entire Yale community, for example, 
was expected to get into the shelters 
nine to fifteen minutes after the first 
warning signal. 

These inherent flaws led many of the 
faculty, 
students, 
and alumni 
oppose the Civil Defense project. With 
the exception of Colonel Gimbel, who 
one alumnus described as having 
"proto-military views," even the 
committee didn't take the program 
seriously. As Professor John Blum 
remembers, "It was all a big joke. No 
one really thought the shelters would 
do the job." 

In addition to technical faults, many 
were concerned 
that the 
shelters 
encouraged the acceptance of the 
inevitability of war. One alumnus, 
Lawrence M. Bensky, '58, associate 
editor of Random House, wrote Yale 
President A. Whitney Griswold to ask, 
"Is it the place of an institution 
founded and dedicated to the cause of 
liberal, humanitarian 
learning to 
encourage and support such a blatantly 
defeatist and foolish project?" And as 
Assistant Professor Robert L. Herbert 
reasoned, "the deeper the shelter, the 
bigger the bomb." 

The shelters 
remained 
intact, 
though unused and ignored. In 1976, 
however, several TD students broke 
into a shelter and stoltÂ· barbiturates 
from it. In response, the adminis-
tration dismantled many of the most 
accessible shelters. But yellow and blue 
warning signs still dot the campus, 
serving as reminders of shelters deep 
within the tunnels, waiting to be used.
