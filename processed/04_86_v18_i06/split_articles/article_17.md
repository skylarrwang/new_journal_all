New Haven/Dan Waterman 
Changing Faces 
On Church Street, across from the 
New Haven Green, a drama is taking 
place. There, on the perimeter of the 
historic green, are the gothic remains of 
New Haven's old City Hall. Once the 
city's center of government, it was 
destroyed in 1928 to make way for an 
expanding city- to make way for 
progress. It is now a thin fac;:ade. Im-
mediately to the left of that fac;:ade is 
a gaping hole, a vacant site set off from 
the street by high walls of chicken wire. 
That site has remained empty for the 
last 40 years. It awaits the construction 
of a new government complex which 
has been consistently begun and 
abandoned since 1928. To the right of 
the old City Hall is the Powell 
18 The New JournaVApril 18, 1986 
Building, 
where an old manual 
elevator clangs up and down its shaft, 
and pounds of plaster fall from the 
ceiling each day. In this decrepit 
building the New Haven government 
now 
temporarily 
resides, 
as 
government employees 
anxiously 
await its demolition. 
These three sites embody a great 
deal of New Haven's history, its 
changes, its growth, or perhaps its lack 
thereof. New Haven is a city which for 
decades has been on the decline, 
plagued by stagnation and decay. The 
government's current place of 
residence, 
the 
dilapidated 
Powell 
Building, symbolizes the failure of past 
attempts at renewal. But the scene also 
suggests a potential for improvement. 
The Powell building is scheduled to be 
demolished next month, and a new, 
badly needed government complex 
and twenty-five story office tower will 
be built in its place next year. 
The city government, spurred on by 
a strong and relatively stable economy, 
cheap construction costs, and low 
interest rates, has been anxious to 
revitalize this once flourishing city. 
Many projects have come to f~uition 
over the last few years, due mostly to 
City Hall's recruitment of private real 
estate developers. The theater district 
has been 
renovated, 
and new 
downtown residential and office 
buildings have been constructed. But
