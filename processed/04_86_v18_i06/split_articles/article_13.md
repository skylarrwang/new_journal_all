Words on Creation

Last January, when I posted my class list for my spring term course in fiction writing, I added a note to ease the pains of those who had applied to the course- admission was by writing sample only-and weren't accepted. "I could easily fill another section with qualified applicants," I wrote honestly.  Some days later I passed by the English Department bulletin board to find a rejoinder scribbled at the bottom of the sheet. "Why don't you, dammit?" it read. The expletive may not in fact have been there, but I'm certain it was present in the writer's mind.


I felt badly that day, vowed never again to put a note at the bottom of a class list, and thought a lot about what prompted the remark. I recognized that the person simply wanted a chance to write, to test his or her mettle, and to explore the possibilities of his or her imagination with fellow writers, and a teacher who has something to say about the craft of writing. It strikes me that the student wasn't asking a great deal.


The fact is that in recent years the number of applicants to writing courses at Yale have far outpaced the course offerings. This past year, the English Department's three fiction writing seminars (each accommodating about twelve to fifteen students) had well over two hundred applicants. A similar circumstance existed with the poetry and nonfiction courses offered.


In defense of the Department, there's a healthy range of offerings: the three courses in fiction writing; two in poetry; four in nonfiction (if you include the English 120-121 sequence and the autobiography course); and the invaluable "Daily Themes" (an altogether remarkable course which, because it is so expensive to run and luckily has its own funding, remains virtually unique in American higher education).


There are also writing courses offered in the College Seminar Program, often as many as 10 an academic year, but as the program is designed to generate courses on an ad hoc basis, its list is necessarily unpredictable, a circumstance often overlooked by curriculum planners who tend to rely on its offerings. In addition, there are the offerings of Yale's Summer Writing Program: eight intensive workshop writing courses in poetry, fiction, nonfiction and playwrighting are taught in July and August and give students the opportunity to work unencumbered by a full course load.


As I look back across this list, I find it hard to say that the range of offerings still doesn't meet the needs of qualified students. But the hard evidence of experience (I've taught for the English Department, the College Seminar Program, and the Summer Writing Program) leads me to say that the demand remains.


"And, moreover, can the need be met- is the craft of writing something that actually can be taught?"


Why is this? Why the explosion of interest in writing? Is it a fad, or a deeper trend?  Given declining enrollments in the humanities (I should note here that writing course applicants tend to come from the full spectrum of undergraduate majors offered at Yale), why this strange reversal? And, moreover, can the need be met- is the craft of writing something that actually can be taught?


To me, this constellation of issues has a lot to do with certain failures of American secondary education, shortsighted undergraduate curriculum design, and the generally remarkable resilience of American students. I can only offer what might be termed some pop psychology reactions to the phenomenon of interest in writing courses at this point- I find myself caught up in my own reactions.


Among the things I can say are these: I've long noticed a trend in liberal arts disciplines to mistake the history of the discipline for the discipline itself. For example, most of my academic background is in philosophy. I used to be amazed that I was never encouraged to, for lack of a better word, philosophize; my discipline of study was, with rare exceptions, a history of thought about the nature of the discipline, about Plato, or Descartes, or Nietzche.


Up to a point, this was welcome. I was learning how to think. Independent thinking, though, was rather discouraged; or, at least, my teachers didn't know how to react to it. In short, to my dismay, the attempts to teach me critical thinking- which to me should have encouraged independent thought-trained me less to examine life (as Socrates would have had it) or to wonder at the order of things (as Aristotle might have wished), and trained me more to be a critic, to essentially react to what others had to say on the subject of living.


I find myself taking this experience and reading it into the circumstances of current curriculum design. I am part of an entire generation whose training has been to assume that critical thinking is reactive thinking, a generation that has swallowed its frustrations with its own teachers and has mutely decided to carry on a sham. I don't mean to sound bitter; most certainly there is a need to inculcate a canon of knowledge, but beyond this there is also a need to encourage fresh, independent thought.


This problem, the growth of my own writing concerns, and the fact that, as I used to joke with my students, the training of students to read literary works for meaning alone and not for how that meaning was produced was producing more critics and fewer independent writers, so much so that I worried if these newly hatched critics would have anything to criticize save each other's critical efforts, has led me to my current position.


Couple this with two other issues, one, that American secondary education in the past fifteen years has largely ignored training in writing; and two, that many American students, increasingly those at Yale, are savvy enough to see through the issues of training of criticism-as-reaction (I don't claim to say that any Yale student has thought of the issue in just such a way- indeed, I think many want to explore creative writing opportunities as a blind reaction to this miasma) as a dead end, and you have a fairly complete picture of this constellation. Though I'm tempted to say that the lionizing of criticism-as-art plays into this problem, I don't intend to deal with it here.


What I do intend to take up is the interest in creative writing courses as a reaction to current curriculum design. I take it, perhaps wrongly I admit, as a desire to revivify the current canon of knowledge. In literature, it doesn't strike me as wrong to see a student wish to test him or herself, after a reading of Dickens, Cervantes, Hemingway, or Henry Fielding, and say, "I could go one better than that." I also take it as a response to current writers in the medium. I take it too, as a frustrated response to the hyper-critical mentality that abounds in the humanities disciplines and which shows itself in writing that, both on the level of students and teachers, is wooden and aimless. "Why else," I say to myself, "would there be such an interest in self-expression?" The sixties and early seventies were rife with such concerns. The street, though, offered outlets that aren't available now.


Today, only rough shanties on Beinecke Plaza seem to offer the outlets desired by those interested in political expression.


Interest in artistic expression remains much more difficult to determine. One thing strikes me as clear; a desire for self-expression outstrips the current means of responding to it. Insofar as this has to do with writing, the question remains, can writing be taught? More importantly, can it be taught with an awareness of circumstances addressed? The desire for self-expression stands as only one of the concerns that contemporary students have. Equally important is a dominant pre-professional sense which, I think, justified exploration of the craft of writing. Craft, as opposed to art per se, offers an answer.


Many years ago, Malcolm Cowley wrote an essay on the proliferation of undergraduate courses in creative writing. In it, he wrote, "I doubt that any instructor, however earnest or inspired, can teach any group of students, however talented, to create anything whatever. He cannot give them experience of the world, or a desire to communicate the experience, or do more for their power of invention than merely encourage it, if the power already exists. What he can properly teach the students, or expose them to the opportunity of learning, are rules and practices to be deduced from other people's writing, the standards of the writing profession, and the known resources of language as a medium. He cannot teach the art of writing, since that is unteachable by definition; it is something a fortunate student will learn for himself."


I don't think Cowley was far off in his time, or now. The art of expression cannot, of itself, be taught. Craft, however, can be. For my part, I presume to do no more. That I've been able to work successfully within a liberal arts program stands not simply as testament to the flexibility of Yale's offerings, it stands too as testament to the perspicacity of Yale students who, reading through work, come to understand that the effort of reading lends itself to writing, and that by writing much one learns to write well, and beyond that, to say something real and alive, pure and simple. That the effort of reading lends itself to the effort of criticism is just, but springboarding into new ground is equally just. Opportunities exist for this. There should be more of them.
