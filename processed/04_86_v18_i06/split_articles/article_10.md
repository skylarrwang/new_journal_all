Off With a Kick 
For Melissa King, MC '87, Fridays are 
spent dancing. In the morning, she 
rehearses for 
two 
hours with 
Yaledancers. During the afternoon, 
she is dancing again, this time as a 
member of the Paul Hall Dance 
Company (PHDC), 
a 
professional 
group in New Haven. "It's hard 
dancing five hours," King said, "but 
when it's over, it's a great feeling to 
know that you've danced all day." 

King joined PHDC when asked by 
Paul Hall, the group's director. He is 
also a member of the local funk band 
Mikata, and recently choreographed 
"The Wiz" at Ezra Stiles College. Hall, 
after seeing the Yaledancers, asked six 
of the group's members to join his 
fledgling company when it formed in 
January. Along with King, Rachel 
Chapman, MC '86, accepted the offer. 

Apart from these two Yaledancers, 
and two other Yale students, PHDC 
has 11 members; they range from high 
school students, 
who work as 
apprentices, 
33 year-old 
professional dancer. Some commute 
from as far as New York to work with 
Hall, who choreographs all of the 
group's material. Their repertoire, he 
said, ranges from "contemporary ballet 
to Afro-Caribbean to jazz to modern." 
Or, as King put it, "Everything but 
tap." 

For the Yaledancers, though, the 
PHDC offers much more than a 
spectrum of dance styles. "It's so 
healthy to be involved with something 
outside of Yale," King said. "It's a 
whole different 
mind 
frame." 

Chapman also finds the atmosphere 
refreshing. "A lot of the younger 
people in the company have a really 
idealistic attitude about making the 
commitment," she said. 

Commitment, on the other hand, 
deterred some of the other Yaledancers 
from joining. "I didn't feel I was ready 
to dance in that sort of league," said 
Nobel Bellosillo, PC '88, "and it 
seemed like I would have to make a 
choice 
between 
them 
Yaledancers." PHDC rehearses Friday 
evenings and Saturdays, th us 
permitting King and Chapman to 
continue their work with Yaledancers 
during the week. Still, as Robyn Reid, 
SY '87, 
another who tentatively 
rejected the offer, put it, "Friday and 
Saturday are really prime social time." 

Thus far, PHDC has put on several 
short performances, including a 
presentation at the Dixwell Q H ouse, a 
New Haven cultural center, as part of 
Black 
H istory Month. 
King and 
Chapman played a prominent part in 
that show, performing a duet called 
"Gentle Spirit." The. company is 
currently working toward a large 
performance for September, possibly 
to take 
place at 
New Haven's 
Educational Center for the Arts. 

Using th~ summer rehearsals, H all 
hopes to develop a core group of 
dancers in order to form a touring 
company. "The thing that really scares 
me," he said, "is when the summer 
comes, everybody wants to go away." 

King, however, does not foresee a 
problem. 
She plans 
stay the 
summer, and to continue her work 
with the group next year. "It has a lot 
of potential," she said. "I think it'll 
definitely hold together." 

The key to that endurance may be 
PHDC's unique combination of 
dancers; Hall describes the group as 
"multicultural and multiracial." It also 
offers a 
wide range of age and 
experience. 

Another Yale student 
member, FrancisJue, BK '86, is not a 
Yaledancer. "In my experience, a lot of 
companies are very cutthroat," said 
J ue, who took off last year to work in 
musical theater in New York City. "I 
think Paul's company is a really 
nurturing group of people. We work 
well together. We're not out there 
believing that "We know what dance 
is."
