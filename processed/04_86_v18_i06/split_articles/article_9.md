Wearing Success 
Esther Kashkin believes that within 
seconds of meeting someone, we assess 
that person's economic status, social 
status and educational background. 
Her image consulting company, 
Elements of Style, reflects this belief. 
For $65, Kashkin will help students to 
express professionalism through their 
clothes, without losing their personal 
style. "Clothing is a metaphor for your 
personality," Kashkin said. "I want to 
teach the language of what you wear." 

When Kashkin first came to New 
Haven a year and a half ago, she was 
surprised to see how Yale students 
dressed. Where were the conservative 
pinstripe oxfords and khakis, so often 
imitated in her native California? 
Conscious that many students do not 
change their casual manner of dress for 
job interviews, she decided to open her 
business last December for the Yale 
community. 

In order to create images, Kashkin 
follows a three-step process. She begins 
by interviewing her clients to discover 
what kinds of clothing, makeup (if they 
are women), 
and hairstyles 
they 
prefer. She then looks at her customers' 
wardrobes. Finally, when a suit and 
hairstyle are agreed upon, Kashkin 
video tapes her clients to show them 
how they move in their clothes. "I want 
to make [the customers] feel good 
about wl;tat they are dressed in," she 
said. 

Kashkin does not attempt to force 
the same trend on all of her customers. 
Instead, she suggests three outfits, 
usually created from the clothes her 
clients already own. When Rebel Ely, 
TD '87, complained that she had little 
use 
for her conservative Brooks 
Brothers suit, Kashkin showed her 
how it could be used for casual dinner 
parties as well as business interviews. 
Occasionally customers want to buy 
new items of clothing; Kashkin will 
purchase them wholesale and ensure 
that they blend in with the client's 
wardrobe. "She showed me how to 
make sure every piece of clothing fits 
like a jigsaw puzzle," Ely said. 

Kashkin worked 
as a 
costume 
designer in California. Over the last 
five years she has received critical 
acclaim for her designs, including the 
Los Angeles Drama Circle Critics 
Award. When she moved to New 
Haven with her husband, Kenneth 
Kashkin, a fellow of Berkeley College, 
she was unable to find work as a 
costume designer with the 
Yale 
Repertory Theatre or The Long 
Wharf; so, she decided to open her 
business. "It grew from a desire to 
work with clothing in theatrical terms," 
she said. Now, instead of scripts and 
history 
books, 
Kashkin conducts 
research on 
images desired 
by 
companies. She also refers to a guide in 
which companies specify what 
applicants should wear during their 
interviews. 

However, Kashkin has found that 
the idea of creating images for students 
is "a very difficult thing to market." 
Relying on word of mouth and an 
advertisement in the classified section 
of the Yale Business Bulletin, she has 
advised 20 men and women, from both 
the undergraduate and graduate 
schools. 

To Kashkin this limited 
response shows that Yale students don't 
want to believe that a job offer may 
hinge upon their image. "I think a lot 
of people don't see a need for it," said 
Ely, "but my God, I feel so much 
better."
