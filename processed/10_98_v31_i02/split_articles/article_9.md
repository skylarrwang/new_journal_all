Clap: "On your feet!" 
Clap: "On your back!" 
Twenty Capoeira students 
spring up and fall to the hard 
wood floor. 

Master Robert Thompson 
and his Timothy Dwight clan might print 
it on their shirts, but they are not the only 
ones in New Haven with ashl. Ashl is the 
force responsible for all movement in 
the universe, according to some African 
religions in Brazil. In the basement of a 
church on the corner of Olive and 
Chapel Streets Capoeira master Efriam 
Silva and his class conjure the energy 
force ashl as well. 

Capoeira is a dueling dance that emerged 
in sixteenth century Brazil with the arrival of 
African people during Portuguese colonization. 
Though its precise origins and definition 
seem as hard to pin down as the fluidity of 
capoeiristas, Efriam explains that it began as a 
martial art. "Because martial arts were banned 
among slaves, it was disguised as a dance," he 
says. In a match, a jogo, two capoeiristas meet 
each other in a roda, a closed circle of people 
playing music. The players seem to duel with 
kicks but dance as they anticipate and move 
with their partners, often without contact. 

When I come in, the class is practicing 
Capoeira music on the berimbau, the 
atabaque and the pandeiro. Music is an essential 
element of Capoeira, and a master must 
be proficient in the songs and rhythms as well 
as the physical motions. From a student's perspective 
music is intrinsic to developing a 
sense of timing and positioning. The berimbau, 
a curved wooden bow with a taut metal 
string which is beaten with a stick and rattle, 
is respected as a spiritual authority. Before 
entering the circle capoeiristas touch the 
berimbau as a reverent gesture to ensure protection 
during their match. Many of the more 
dedicated students have made their own; a 
capoeirista is encouraged to play it, care for it, 
and personalize it, infusing it with the energy 
needed for a good roda. 


Efriam challenges the students with repetition 
to make the motions instinctive. They 
repeat the basic step, the ginga, until all the 
students have their turn counting to ten in 
Portuguese. Clad in sweatpants lined with colors 
of 
Brazilian loyalty-green and yellow-students 
also wear a belt that denotes their 
level. A baptized novice gains a white 
cord and then one in green, yellow, 
blue, or any combination of the four 
until a master is crowned again with 
white. 

Two beginner students, Dennis 
Price and Toni Beluci, explain that 
Capoeira is a way of life. "I travel all over to 
participate in Capoeira events and because I 
share this interest with others, anywhere I go 
I have a place to stay," explains Dennis. "It's 
addictive-in a good sense," adds Toni. Its 
motions and rhythms permeate these students' 
daily routines, affecting everything 
from their physical movements to their mindset. 
"It's not just a game, it's a mind thing," 
says Dennis. Even from my bench view 
Capoeira is transfixing. 

From my less lofty perspective in Trumbull, 
Timothy Dwight might seem invincible 
on the Intramural fields with the power of 
ashl. This class of capoeiristas has an ashl of a 
different sort. Though Capoeira is performed 
with grace and fluidity and ideally without 
contact, it can be lethal. An article in Ebony 
magazine in 1947 declared that, "In a real 
attack, the aim of the Capoeira fighter is to 
throw an attacker so the softest part of his 
skull crashes upon the ground or pavement, 
either killing or kayoing." Ashl!
