"See? Here it says the dish is 10 feet and 
two inches long. But that's wrong!" Ken 
Grimes flips through some carefully annotated 
photocopies which he pulled from several 
carefully labelled envelopes. "Here, it says it's 
30. That's right. I have it in ten other books. 
Three are in my library. This is more important 
than the Cheshire coincidences that got 
me started. There are 200 or 300 of these mistakes, 
I think. If we can find enough, we can 
statistically prove this." 

"What's your explanation for these mistakes?" 

"There's 
a 
conflict 
with 
reality. 
Astronomers start writing about what they 
know without realizing that there's an alien 
metaphysically and psychically there causing 
Freudian slips." 

Ken's face is reminiscent of Statler or 
Waldorf, the old Muppets who used to sit in 
the opera box on *The Muppet Show*, but he's 
younger, wears older, dirtier clothing, and has 
less of a sense of dramatic timing. But that's 
all right-his art speaks for itself. Quite often, 
there's someone to speak for him-The New 
York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and glossy 
catalogs from art exhibitions around the 
world offer their voices. In the words of the 
commentary-rich 
anthology 
*Self-Taught 
Artists of the Twentieth Century*, "His oeuvre is 
a huge, continuously growing book about visitors 
from outer space; each individual work is 
a self-contained 'page' that can be understood 
on its own, yet in style, look, and subject matter 
relates to every other 'page.'" 

Ken hangs out at Fellowship Place, on 
Elm Street. Fellowship Place is a job training 
facility, an art school, a food provider, a psychiatric 
treatment facility, and a welfare-to-work program; 
it combines all of these services into a one-of-a-kind 
psychiatric outpatient resource center. Of course, 
that includes 
providing art supplies, art education, 
and help in finding agents and 
navigating the art world for anyone 
who should happen to need it. Ken 
is just one of many fellowship 
workers who display their work in 
the friendly complex of barns. 

But Ken's art goes beyond the 
aesthetic. "I don't know how I 
could get the word out except by 
painting. I enjoy coming up with 
the ideas, and the recognition, but 
not the work involved with putting 
paint on large canvases." By restricting 
his palette to black and white, Ken 
evokes the usual colors of printed 
materials, and the idiom about having 
something in "black and white" as a 
claim to fact and truth. However, 
he turns the process inside out by 
making the words and objects white 
against a black background, like 
photographic negatives. 

Ken abruptly decides the conversation 
is over, gathering up his 
folders and opening the door. 

"Do you think people understand 
the messages behind your 
work?" 

"No," he tosses over his shoulder. 
"They don't." This is the first 
time he's broken through a monotone that 
resulted from a mental breakdown during his 
sophomore year of college. 

"Grimes' nuanced grays not only provide 
a delicate gamut between dark and light, but 
also hint at 'gray areas' in our understanding 
and communication," according to *Self-Taught 
Artists*. 

Ken couldn't have achieved his fame without 
Kate Walton, a mental health professional 
and the Executive Director of Fellowship 
Place. While she is proud of Fellowship's support 
for artists, she sees a greater force at work 
in creating these artists. "Schizophrenics' 
minds are just liberated to new levels. A normal 
mind shuts off before they get to experience 
those things. I don't know that many talented 
artists who aren't, well, rather eccentric." Still, 
she realizes that the problems Ken 
faces in working with his agent, keeping his 
finances in order, and doing public relations 
are greater than many artists' challenges. 

"The art people don't necessarily 
believe in his ideas either. There's 
just this harmonic convergence 
between popular ideas and striking 
art," says Walton. Perhaps because 
she's tired (her head is sagging), a 
note of annoyance at Ken's fame 
creeps into her voice. Walton 
prefers the brightly-colored work of 
another Fellowship artist, Maurice 
Hansen, whose enthusiastic painting 
of Fellowship's "Street of 
Dreams" festival adorns her office 
wall. "I mean, Ken's art looks great 
in New York City apartments with 
lots of stainless steel and black 
formica and ... and whatever they 
have," she says. 

"In this chromatic synthesis, 
the stark demands of black and 
white are tremulously linked by the 
subtleties of gray," explains *Self-Taught 

Ken reaches out to the people 
in the murky realm between skepticism 
and a desire to believe. "There's 
room for a lot of different voices in 
this," Ken says. "You could even 
help."
