EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
On the first really cold morning of the 
year, I walk into TYCO to get the story 
behind the boy whose enormous picture 
hangs on their wall. Despite the early hour, 
the machines are already humming, and some 
over-ambitious students are competing for 
space at the tiny counter. Ah, the familiar reek 
of ink and paper and ~PY machines worked 
past capacity. 

I take a quick glance up at 
the "TYCO kid," as I've silently 
dubbed him. Looking at this 
happy youth, with his knobby 
kid-elbows and tufted brown 
hair. who wouldn't be curious? 
The TYCO kid is possibly the 
second-biggest celebrity figure 
on campus. He is, at four feet by 
six feet, a little boy of preposterous 
proportions. It is time to 
put an end to the mystery. 

Michael Iannuzzi, Sr. is the 
owner of TYCO and the father 
of the TYCO kid. He takes me 
up to his spacious third floor office overlooking 
Broadway to tell me about his son, who is 
now all grown up. Ellie Iannuzzi, the mother, 
ducks in for a few comments. "People come 
into the store, and they know it's my son," she 
says with just a hint of motherly pride. 

The explanation of the poster itself is 
rather mundane. "We needed something to 
show that we could make big prints with our 
machine," says Mr. Iannuzzi. "So you know, I 
went through the photos. That one has always 
been a favorite of mine." The poster is of 
Mike, Jr. at age ten or so, an up-and-coming 
player for a little league team with a fearsome 
name: Standard Oil. 

Iannuzzi has the same photo hanging in 
his garage at home, in a somewhat less gigantic 
size. It hangs alongside a print of the 
TYCO kid's sister, who used to have her picture 
hanging in the store, screen-printed on a 
T-shirt. "It's the first thing I see when I come 
home," says Iannuzzi. 

Conversation switches over to the TYCO 
kid's erstwhile baseball career (which, incidentally, 
terminated during his freshman year of 
high school in favor of basketball). "Mike was 
a very good player as a little kid. He had a 
good arm. It was probably his strong suit as a 
young player, a very powerful arm," says Mr. 
Iannuzzi. The TYCO kid mainly stuck to 
pitcher, catcher, and third baseman, but as a 
little leaguer, he naturally played every position. 

At this point, I am allowed, upon request, 
to actually hold the TYCO kid's glove-the 
same one as in the poster. Like any true kid's 
glove, it is creased over, sandwich style. I 
touch its surface, still finely gritted with dirt, 
graying and ready to fall apart. The lettering 
has all fallen off, no doubt the result of the 
graceless bobbles that characterize little league 
play. 

This trip down memory lane prompts 
other recollections of yesteryear. The TYCO 
kid was very quiet as a child, as one might 
guess from the shy Bambi eyes we're so accustomed 
to seeing in the poster. 

"In nursery school, Michael just would 
not talk," says Mrs. Iannuzzi. "He'd play with 
all the kids and everything, but wouldn't talk 
to them." For a moment, I can't help but 
imagine little Mike sitting next to chattering 
kids, crushing trucks together with both 
hands, mouth sealed shut. 

Mr. Iannuzzi echoes this sentiment, a bit 
proudly. "I don't care how good of an interviewer 
you were, from 60 Minutes or something, that 
kid was just not going to talk to 
you. He'd speak to us of course, but 
there was no way he would talk to 
an outsider." 

"High school was his turning 
point," says Mrs. Iannuzzi. As these 
parents launch into a description of 
Mike's high school career, it quickly 
becomes clear that Mr. and Mrs. 
Iannuzzi are indeed the TYCO kid's 
biggest fans. "He never gave us trouble, an 
honors student, always 
worked hard," says Mr. Iannuzzi. 

Mrs. Iannuzzi offers to list all of 
Mike's awards for me. "It seemed we 
were always going to award banquets." 

Indeed, Mike was something of an overachiever: 
captain of the varsity basketball team 
senior year, class president junior year, student 
council vice-president senior year. "What do 
you expect me to say? He was perfect," laughs 
Mrs. Iannuzzi. 

All of this is a far cry from the sweet little 
TYCO kid who we all know and love. Mike 
Iannuzzi is grown up, currently 20 years old 
and a junior at Boston College. A contemporary. 

He is training, it seems, to be a future 
oppressor of the masses. It is with great consternation 
that I learn of the TYCO kid's current enrollment 
in the Carroll School of Management. His class 
schedule this semester, aside from a philosophy 
course: finance, marketing, management information 
systems, and business systems. 

I find it somehow disheartening to think 
of the TYCO kid, out in the corporate world 
serving the Man and crushing the proletariat. 
Perhaps this is an omen. If even the TYCO 
kid can join the Dark Side, what is the average 
Yalie destined for? 

Personally, along with other Yalies rooting 
from the sidelines, I'd like to see the TYCO 
kid take over the family business, one of the 
few mom-and-pop enterprises left on Broadway. 
This possibility is something that has 
been seriously discussed in the Iannuzzi 
household. "These past two summers I started 
to take TYCO very seriously," says Mike. 

Mr. Iannuzzi says that he just wants Mike 
to be happy. "He should have the option to 
involve himself with TYCO. If he's leaning in 
this direction, if he wants to come here, I 
don't want him to look at what I've done. I 
want him to do his own thing-he should 
have his vision of the future." 

The start of a dynasty? If Mike goes on to 
own TYCO and then has a child, perhaps he 
will tack up a gigantic photo of his kid right 
next to his own. Every generation thereafter 
could add huge pictures of their children on 
the wall of the store, passing the TYCO kid 
torch. Each picture would be a reminder of 
years past, a snapshot of youth frozen in time.
