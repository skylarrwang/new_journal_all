Trumbull Street between Hill-
"Maple 
Cottage," 
located 
on 
including the derelict Davies Mansion on 
Prospect Street; the Trust promised to stand 
aside while Yale sold the Kingsley-Blake House ~ 
house and Temple, is a remnant 
of another New Haven. The great American archi-
tect Alexander Jackson Davis designed the house in 1836 as part of the 
plan for an elaborate city envisioned by his patron, James Hillhouse. 
Maple Cottage was intended to be among the formal mansions looked 
down upon by the lavish Hillhouse Estate (now Science Hill). While 
study elms lined Hillhouse, the "cottages" on side streets like Trumbull 
bad to settle for respectable maples. 
Two maple trees still stand outside Maple Cottage. But by the time 
Yale acquired the house in 1976, previous owners had buried much of 
the exterior detail under a drab layer of stucco. A notice on the door of 
the abandoned building announces Yale's intention to demolish it 
before winter, and to lay down a parking lot in its place. Yale has found 
an unlikely ally for its plans in the New Haven Preservation Trust. 

Yale administracors have considered Maple Cottage a liability since 
1995, when the Center for International and Area Studies left the 
building for Luce Hall. They kept this sentiment to themselves until 
February 26 of this year, when Yale President Richard Levin (GRD '74) 
and the President of the Preservation Trust Edward Bottomley (CC 
'81) signed an unprecedented agreement in a public ceremony in Bat-
tell Chapel. Yale promised to renovate four decaying local landmarks, 
OcrosER 9, 1998 
on Trumbull Street and demolished neighboring Maple Cottage. 

Signed more than two years after the creation of Yale's Office of ~ 
New Haven and State Affairs, the February 26 agreement was one of ~ 
the notable accomplishments of Yale's new policy of community ~ 
engagement. In the following months, however, consensus within the ~ 
Trust and the local preservation community evaporated, and those f 
opposed to the Trust's vision of cooperation with Yale coalesced into the ~ 
Friends of Hillhouse Avenue. Members of this new group suggest that ~ 
the February agreement merely rubber-stamped Yale's pre-existing ~ 
plans, and that the Trust's directors were railroaded into its approval. 

Much to the chagrin of the Friends of Hillhouse, the Preservation ~ 
Trust signed off on a landscaped parking lot as the temporary replace- g 
ment for Maple Cottage. However, according to recendy released plan-
~ 
ning documents, Yale has higher hopes for Trumbull Str~. In a letter .., 
to the Connnecticut Historic Commission, the Office of Facilities cited ; 
a planning consultant, writing, "One of their recommendations is that ~ 
this become the primary entrance to Yale, a major gateway to the Uni-
versity and New Haven." In the long term, Yale promises a new build- ~ 
ing of similar size and placement. "A more substantial building, hous-
ing academic or student administrative offices, if properly scaled, would 
be a more suitable announcement of the Uni-
versity on Trumbull Street," according to Yale 
planning documents.Â· 

To the untrained eye, Maple Cottage 
doesn't look like much to fight for. 
However, 
architectural 
historian 
Anstress Farwell insists that the cracked stucco 
could be peeled back to reveal original 19th 
century detail. Farwell is an old hand at New 
Haven preservation activism. Eighteen years 
thought she could convince them to go back 
to Yale for a new round of. negotiations. "The 
Board was completely pciralyzed," she says. 
Although the Trust had agreed not to pose 
any legal obstacles to Maple Cottage's demoli-
tion, nothing prevented Farwell, an indepen-
dent consultant, from filing the papers that 
would force Yale to bring its case for demoli-
tion before the State Historical Commission 
in Hartford this September. 

By this summer, Farwell's initiative had 
ago, as a graduate stu-
dent in architectural his-
tory, she led a group that 
forced Yale to preserve 
the Davies 
Mansion. 
Still technically a Yale 
Ph.D candidate, 
she 
now works as a freelance 
preservation consultant 
and is the driving force 
behind the Friends of 
Hillhouse. Citing the 
dirty stucco and the 
metal fire escape slapped 
onto one side of the 
building, Farwell blames

night meetings of the 
Friends of Hillhouse. 
This ad hoc organiza-
tion reflects the two 
types of people who 
make up the preserva-
tionist 
community: 
those who own fabulous 
old houses, and those 
who make a Uving from 
them.

Maple Cottage's current state on 20 years of 
Yale ownership. "This is demolition by 
neglect," she says. 
The world of New Haven preservationists 
is a small one, and Farwell first learned about 
the Trust's agreement with Yale through Trust 
President Bottomley, her friend, former 
neighbor, and current nemesis. The Trust's 
Board of Directors had already passed the 
agreement by a vote of 22-0, but Farwell 
bers of an older New Haven eUte, as well as 
professional historians and preservationists. 
The discussion sometimes digresses into talk 
of leaky slate roofs, decrepit chimneys, and 
excessive property taxes, but centers on the 
members' shared sense that the Preservation 
Trust betrayed its mission by signing the Feb-
ruary agreement with Yale. Many of the 
Friends of Hillhouse are members of the 
Preservation Trust, among them four Direc-
