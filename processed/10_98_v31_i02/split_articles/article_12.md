The contrast with the Gothic architecture of Sterling Memorial Library was striking. What attracted me to it, however, was not so much its aesthetic strength as the significance of the outwardly spiraling numbers, marking the entrance of women into Yale. 

This year, when I arrived on campus and saw Maya Lin's sculpture again, I realized that 1993 was the last year the number of women enrolled at Yale was inscribed; after that year the spiral ends. I was somewhat disappointed by this, because I still fostered my wish to be a part of the spiral. I went to the Manuscripts and Archives department at the library to find out why numbers were no longer being added. I soon learned that Lin designed the Table so that the spiral would end at 1993, the year the sculpture was installed. 

The chief research archivist, Judith Schiff, informed me that she had worked on the project to research the enrollment of women at Yale in earlier years, which was far from a routine task. Women's names first appeared in Yale's records in 1873, four years after the founding of the coeducational School of the Fine Arts. The names of those who enrolled during its first years are lost. For a long time after 1873, only the names of students were recorded. Schiff and her colleagues had to research students with ambiguous names such as "Stacey" or "Lee" to determine their genders. One woman, likely the first to study at Yale, did not appear in the records as female because she applied and was accepted to the law school under her initials. Although the administration did not prevent her from enrolling when her gender became apparent, it soon created a policy explicitly prohibiting the enrollment of women at Yale. 

The Women's Table is an understated reminder of a time when the inclusion of women at Yale was something first nonexistent, then tenuous and extraordinary. The presence of women is now integral to the life of the university and ordinary in the best sense of the word. Yet inequalities still exist, as we see from a tenured faculty that is 89 percent male. Lin wrote, "The choice of a spiral was to mark a beginning but to leave the future open." Now that the matriculation of women and men is equal, Yale's strides toward equality can no longer be contained by numbers on a table.
