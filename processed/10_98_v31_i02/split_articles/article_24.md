George Platt Lynes Returns To Yale, exhibit at Beinecke Rare 
Book & Manuscript Library and jonathan Edwards College. 
Through October 30th. 
"This place is infuriating," George Platt 
Lynes wrote of Yale to Gertrude Stein in 
1926. "The conventions begin nowhere in 
particular and are perfectly endless. This after-
noon I had expounded to me the only way 
that one might be eccentric and live. By insin-
uating oneself quietly into 'the group,' by 
writing and publishing a few 'charming' lines 
in the Lit, {a supposedly-literary monthly 
which avowedly refuses to be alive), by sub-
mitting so thoroughly to the custom and con-
vention that the student has created to protect 
himself from all but a little harmless com-
ments that one has experienced it all, one may 
depart a little (very little) from the accus-
tomed ways .. .And. I CANNOT DO IT. And 
there is no other way ... so MUCH FOR YALE!" 
Lynes had met Miss Stein, as he addressed 
her in his early .letters, the previous summer in 
Paris. He had been at Yale for a little over two 
months. From school, he envisioned Stein as 
his mentor in bohemianism, enamored as he 
was of her talent and connections. This was 
before the publication of The Autobiography of 
Alice B. Toklas and before Stein had become a 
household name. He solicited her opinions of 
his work, including in his letters poems that 
Stein seems to have thought little of. 
In the '20s, Lynes fancied himself a bud-
ding writer, a furure member of a vanguard 
community, and his letters from this period 
are insistent in their literary pretensions (sin-
gle-word sentences punctuate his letters, an 
arch dismissal of middle-class expectations 
circulates throughout). Judging from his epis-
tolary style it would seem he had already 
assumed be would be the doquenc voice of an 
insillgent generation. Uorevered and utterly 
miserable, he lefr the university just before the 
end of his first term. 


Lynes' career seems predicated on this 
shirking of his Northeastern upper-middle 
class roots-his father, too, was a Yalie-for 
the more progressive lifestyle lived out in Paris 
and New York by such avant-garde luminaries 
as Stein, Paul Cadmus, and Jean Cocteau. In 
fact, he gave up his literary ambitions, possi-
bly at Stein's suggestion, for photographic 
ones, an interest sparked by the gifr of a Dear-
born camera in 1927 and the publication of 
his first formal portrait of Stein in 1931. 

It was an auspicious career move. Lynes' 
poetry, or what remains of it in manuscript, is 
derivative and boring. His photographs are 
original-he invented the backlighting so art-
fully used by Richard Avedon-and shocking 
for his time in their display of frank homo-
eroticism. To contemporary viewers, when 
the male body is more ubiquitously sexual-
ized, it may be difficult to gauge how contro-
versial these images were. Set in the context of 
the '30s and '40s, it is easy to see his pho-
tographs not as dreamy dements in a surreal 
tableau, but as intimate portraits of idealized 
figures depicting ineyplicable and closeted 
desires. Looking at the photographs, admiring 
their candor, it is no wonder that Dr. Alfred 
Kinsey (the author of the ever-cited Kinsey 
Rrpo~ acquired many of Lynes' nudes in the 
early '50s for his institute in Indiana. 
The exhibition "George Platt Lynes 
Returns to Yale" uses funds from Jonathan 
Edwards College and photographs from Bei-
nccke Library, and is housed in both loca-
tions. This splitting of Lynes' work makes 
both exhibits somewhat small, with the sad 
consequence that the viewer is never able to 
confront all the images at once. Comprehend-
ing Lynes' work becomes something less pub-
lic than intimate, a personal exploration of the 
materials at hand. The exhibition demon-
strates Lynes' virtuousity. There are sumptu-
ous and seamless fashion shots where perfec-
tion seems to be met in the shimmer of light 
f.illing off fur and tropical wool, where men 
and women of ideal proportions confront a 
world of flawless interiors. 


Then, too, there are images of Lynes' liter-
ary friends, ranging from an austere, biblio-
philic Evelyn Waugh, to a shon-trousered, 
domestic Christopher Isherwood, to a man-
De!M, abject Dorothy Parker. Lynes wanted 
to be a writer for most of his young life. As a 
consequence, in the years after Yale he 
befriended budding and established talents, 
using them later as photographic subjects. 
Encapsulating the likes of Andre Gide and W. 
H. Auden, Lynes presented his admiration for 
the writing life, and the individuals talented 
enough to live it. 
According to friend and subject Donald 
Wmdham, Lynes made little distinction 
between the work he did for fashion maga-
zines and his largely unexhibited male nudes. 
During his lifetime, Lynes published his 
nudes only abroad, in the German homoerot-
ic magazine Der Kries, and there only under 
the pseudonyms Roberto Rolf and Roben 
Orville. The nudes are some of the most com-
pelling works in the show. In a moment of 
self-conscious dejection, a naked man tucks 
himself into a ball on a diving board. ln 
another, a pair of barely pubescent boys build 
an acrobatic bridge, backbending off one 
another in front of a timeless gray screen. The 
pictures are strange and beautiful because we 
are unaccustomed to seeing men in such posi-
tions. Vulnerable and vanquished, two men 
lie naked over one another in a hospital bed, a 
mess of interlocking muscles, appendages cov-
ered in bandages. Contemplative and quiet, 
one man stands, back to the camera, staring 
out at a manipulated image of the sea. 


In the freeness with which Lynes explores 
the male form, his works invoke classical 
motifs, yet there is something particularly 
anti-classical about the presentation of men in 
Lynes' photographs. In Greek sculpture hair 
was removed, lest it prevent a proper presenta-
tion of the musculature; here the models 
remain unshaven, a fact that creates provoca-
tive, discomfiting images. The naked man 
staring off at the ocean has a smattering of 
thick black hair on his upper thighs. In the 
gymnastic photograph, a faint suggestion of 
pubic hair crowns the top of the bodily con-
figuration, reminding the viewer that these 
bodies are not merely beautiful, but sexual. 
Their subjects are not meant to be adored, not 
merely admired. 


In the authorial portraits and the nudes, 
the viewer is confronted by the artist's long-
ings--to be a writer, and to express what was 
inexpressible at the time: Lynes' homosexual 
desires. In his Mythology Project-a series of 
surrealized figures from Greek myths-it is as 
if Lynes were pushing the boundaries of artifi-
ciality in his work, exposing the makeup he 
used on his models and studio-set environ-
ments in which he took all his pictures. He 
attempts to set his work free from temporal 
constraint, invoking the timelessness of myth. 
In so doing he creates photographs that seem 
more time-specific (think Edwardian melo-
drama) than any of his other work. Desire 
tranScends time; Lynes' veneration for old sto-
ries does not. 


In this exhibit, George Platt Lynes returns 
to Yale as the artist he aspired to be during his 
brief academic tenure here. His work rebuts 
the controlled society his classmates endured, 
moving as they did through the ranks of Yale 
society, quiedy accepting the norms and rules 
that older students had lain out before 
them-the rules of conduct Lynes dismissed 
as "so dull and stupid you could not imagine," 
in his first letter to Stein from Yale on Octo-
ber 5, 1926. Perhaps there is something relat-
ed in the matrix of homoerotic desire, self-
conciousness, and Lynes' need to rebel against 
the life his parents planned for him. Perhaps it 
is the hallmark of his art that Lynes focused 
on his desires, the desires that must have 
seemed so at odds with what others ex~ed 
ofhim.
