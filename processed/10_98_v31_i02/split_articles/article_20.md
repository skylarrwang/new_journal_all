ichael Braun's father was diagnosed 
with multiple sclerosis when Michael 
was six years old. These pictures were taken 
13 years later, in the. winter of 1997, when 
the. lifestyle dictated by illness had been 
adopted by the family and had long since 
become second nature. 

It's a fairly simple task to photograph 
one's family. It is far more difficult to make 
a picture that extends beyond-pervasive 
familial cliches. Michael manages to 
capture intimate, heartbreaking moments, 
as well as convey their everyday nature. 
This is, as he puts it, "what has settled 
under the air in my house." He succeeds in 
touching upon the complex and weighty 
relationship that exists between husband 
and wife-but not forcefully. I am struck 
by the love with which these photographs 
are so apparently made, drawn as they are 
by the touch that only a son could have-
an interpretation only he could provide.
