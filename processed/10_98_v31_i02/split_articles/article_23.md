markets department. She seemed like just the person to talk to. But she 
wasn't; she was downright hostile. If everyone's character was so perfectly 
summed up by their last name, life would be a lot easier. She had 
been duough the recession of the early '90s and the Clinton~era boom 
and maintained that recruiting was never affected. "There are no problems here," she snipped. When pressed, she admitted they were now 
"assessing" because there was "concern," but she didn't anticipate any 
cuts.


Again I changed my strategy. I decided not to look for a person 
from any particular age group or department. Rather, I decided to talk 
to someone who looked nice. I found a middle~aged man who told me 
the new bankers in his department were scared and confused by the 
market fluctuations. "They're asking, 'What does this all mean?' and 
'What's going to happen to us?"' He, however, was completely at ease. 
It seemed he had even skipped yesterday's round of mandatory haircuts 
that had been inflicted on all the other gendemen in the room. Probably 
out playing with his kids.


For the younger employees, a job at Merrill Lynch would preclude 
having a dog, let alone kids or anything else that might require care. I 
overheard a young man nun down a date because it conflicted with his 
"sell dinner." I must admit that I was unfamiliar with the term and 
thought at first it might be "cell dinner." They both seemed equally fitting. In many ways, in fact, the lifestyle of an !~banker is like that of a 
prison inmate, minus all the play. Maybe it was a reference to a monk 
cdl, which would explain the celibacy and the boring haircuts, too.


Ironically, the firm's official materials did not attempt to hide how 
its employees lived. In the recruiting film, a young man bragged about 
working from ten am to six am. Another admitted that "you can't plan 
anything" in your social life. The glossy companion brochure contained 
a close~up of a few Boors of the World Trade Center at dawn. A number 
of offices still had the lights on, framing silhouetted !~bankers hard 
at work.


M
y hunch that fewer and fewer of these covered offices would 
be available this year had still not been confirmed. By this 
rime the reception was breaking up and I was resigned to 
going against the grain and embracing hierarchy-! had to interview 
Ocrosu 9, 1998 
the big cheese. Before I knew it, I was face to face with Jerry Kenney. I 
had no journalistic tricks up my sleeve; I was going to put it to him 
straight. Besides, Jerry had already acknowledged the problems in the 
global economy. When he reached the part of his presentation about 
Merrill Lynch's $1.4 trillion in assets, he joked that it was "lower this 
month than before summer vacation." Talk about the wrong joke for 
this crowd-he didn't receive a single laugh. Sometimes the best way to 
break some bad news is with a joke, and for Jerry there was no covering 
up the bad news. He believed in the Five Values of Merrill Lynch, and 
number five was Integrity. 
"Do market fluctuations affect recruiting?" I asked. 
"They do," he replied, not realizing how many of his underlings l 
had denied this basic fact. Like the all~American father explaining the ~ 
ins and outs of a carburetor to his son, he gave me a man~t~man on ~ 
the global economy. During growth you need more people, but in "terrible" markets you may have to lay people off. "I guess it will be a year ~ 
of reduced recruiting all over Wall Street," he concluded, estimating ~ 
that Merrill Lynch would have about 150 spaces in its 1999 "class." I 
remembered that earlier in the evening I had spoken with a member of ~ 
the class of '97 who told me he'd trained with 400 recruits. This year ~ 
250 are out with the Asian Bu.


I considered going back to Ms. Rippa and informing her that the 
Bossman had contradicted her, but frankly, I was scared of her. Besides, 
the night was winding down. The seniors were going back to their econ 
homework, the young bankers were packing up for New York, and the 
Man was going back to his house in the suburbs. Before leaving I went 
back up to Jerry and thanked him for being so forduight. "The clients 
know, so you gotta be honest," he told me. At least one man still 
believed in Value Number Five.


As I walked back up Elm Street toward Yale, I tooko~t the recruit~ 
ment materials I had picked up at the beginning of the night. I looked 
at the glossy red portfolio, e:xpect:ing to see it emblazoned with the Mer~ 
rill Lynch slogan, "We're bullish on the future." There was no text; that 
slogan went down with the stock market. The slogan was gone, the 
brash, youthful confidence was gone, only the bull remained.
