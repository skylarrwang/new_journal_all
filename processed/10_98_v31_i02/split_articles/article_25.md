TALKSHOW HOST GLENN BECK SPINS THE STARR REPORT 
AS DAILY DIATRIBE AND ONGOING RADIO DRAMA. 
by Ian Blecher 
While most of the country finds 
the president not guilty by reason of 
inanity, an unregenerate few remain 
resolute unto resignation: the men of 
talk radio. 

Here in New Haven, WELI 
AM-960 has pre-empted its mind-numbing News at Noon with "The 
Impeachment of Character," a program dedicated entirely to hemming . 
and hawing the president out of office. Glenn Beck, who narrates the 
ride to work for WELI's FM affiliate, KC-101, has given up his lunch 
hour to host the show. Maybe host isn't the right word. Beck doesn't 
take callers, interview experts, or prattle with his usual KC 101Â· buds 
about traffic-girl Heather Scott's new outfit. He hardy even analyzes the 
news. Mostly, he just reads the Starr Report, uncut, in order. 


The show is not as boring as it sounds. As he has plumbed deeper 
into Clinton's sewage, Beck has cleaned up his impersonations. The 
president now sounds like a perverted cracker, Vernon Jordan an idiotic 
Uncle Tom, and Monica Lewinsky a Jewish American Princess who fell 
off the short bus on the way to the special school. Complete with stock 
characters and improvised dialogue, "The Impeachment of Character" 
is like a radio play out of the 1930s. However, back then when you 
turned on the radio, you did not hear obscenities like penis and vagina 
and cigar. The show is certainly offensive, but no one seems more 
offended by it than Beck himself, who calls the report "vile," and even 
refused to mention the cigar story when it first broke. So why does 
Beck spread the poison? 

I drove to WELI's studios in Hamden to find out. Beck looks as 
intimidating as he sounds, 6'4" with icy eyes and a paunch that will 
probably keep him off television. When I met him, he was wearing a 
baggy gray sweatsuit and an old-fashioned Yale jacket. I asked him what 
he thought of the president's grand jury testimony. "The tape shouldn't 
have come out," he said, taking a strange position for a guy who's made 
it his job to publicize the scandal. But for Beck, Clinton's legal maneu-
verings hurt the country as badly as his sexual indiscretions. "We're 
involved with a president who's a lawyer, not a leader," he said. "It is 
high time we start searching for a stronger leader." 

You'd think so, wouldn't you? But what about that pesky 69 percent 
of Americans who don't want the lawyer-in-chief impeached? "It's like 
the debate on whether parents matter. It's an excuse for parents who 
aren't spending the time. We impose those same standards on the presi-
dency. We're looking for absolution." 

Beck may be looking for absolution himself. Last year he hosted an 
amorphous call-in program on 
WELI that pre-empted the first 
hour of the immensely popular Dr. 
Laura. To make matters worse, his 
opinions were so abrasive and he 
was so nasty to dissenting callers 
that, after a few weeks, his was almost the only voice. Augustinian arias 
on ethical discordances in Beck's own past swelled into choruses of 
moral indignation. He once asked a caller to read the ten command-
ments over the air as Beck tallied the ones he'd broken. He had broken 
most of them, as it turned out-at least as many as Clinton has. As the 
callers dropped off, he filled the air more and more with random self-
deprecating/self-righteous revelations. The show was short-lived. 


"The Impeachment of Character" is more titillating than Beck's 
earlier attempt, a sort of public confessional for America. Unlike the 
president's defenders, Beck isn't going to make it easy for us: the viler 
the report, the dumber his Lewinsky, the more unctuous his Jordan, 
and the slimier his Clinton. Beck lingers over every lie like a fine meal 
before a guilt-emptying purge. 

So what prevents the show from becoming as lascivious as the pres-
ident? In the end, the scandal Beck dramatizes is a play within a larger 
play about its narrator. Beck's trudge from moral ambiguity to moral 
superiority culminates in judgement of the president, the country, and 
himself. And not for sexual dysfunction-Beck takes that sort of sin for 
granted. "Personal life," he said, "is one thing. The problem is perjury." 

The moral question here isn't about sin but whether we talk honestly 
and openly about it. The inner comedy about Monica and Bill may be 
bawdy and repugnant, but the outer tragedy about Glenn is cathartic 
and edifying. 

Its dialectical structure finally saves "The Impeachment of Charac-
ter" from the obvious hypocrisy of teaching morality by publicizing a 
salacious scandal. The show isn't about a scandal so much as a scandal's 
negation. Beck's rendition of the Starr Report could only be a farce. To 
take the Report on its own, as a dry legal document, would be to cave 
in to the president's miasma of half-truths and jargon. As a comedy, the 
Report comes on the scene already unravelled by morality. By turn, the 
outer drama of Beck's own struggle depends on some kind of inner 
guilt to lament. For him, it seems, the real problem with the unmoved 
69 percent of us is not that we lack a sense of what's right, but that we 
lack a sense of what's wrong. We may agree that lying is bad, but we 
don't think the scandal ought to have happened in the first place. For 
Beck, however, there is no first place without a scandal.
