was always interested in computers. When I 
was there Geraldine Laybourne was president 
and she was interested in girls and so she 
wanted to target materials to them. 

At what point in all this did Bust get started? 

Like I said, I was looking for a way to be 
involved in making good media for women,. 
but there wasn't any place to go. Pretty early 
on at Nickelodeon, I was thinking, "What am 
I going to do with my life? I've spent six years 
getting a Ph.D and now I'm working as a secretary." I'd been reading Sassy and that magazine was so cool, I just thought it was brilliant-all my girlfriends were reading it, and 
we were all in our late 20s ... and all the media 
for women was like Mademoiselle and Glamour, and then all of a sudden riot grrls started 
getting talked about, foxcore music started 
getting talked about, and I thought, you 
know, there are a whole bunch of other chicks 
like me who are not necessarily fulfilling the 
Mademoiselle model of female behavior, who 
would sooner have a bottle of tequila to relax 
than have a long bath and a cup of General 
Foods International Coffee. We need a magazine too. It's great that teenagers have Sassy, 
but what about us older girls? We need to 
have something cool. So I had the idea to 
launch a new magazine and right away I 
thought it should be called Bust-something 
that would be funny and sexy and aggressive-and I mentioned it to a girl I worked 
with at Nickelodeon. A year later she called 
me and said, "Did you ever do anything 
about that magazine idea that you had?" and I 
said no, and she said, "Why don't we get 
together and talk about trying to do it?" But 
being the slacker that I was, that we both 
were, there was no way we were going to say, 
okay, let's make a business proposal, and go 
and get investors ... between sips of coffee and 
smoking cigarettes and going out all night 
every night, there wasn't too much in the way 
of starting a new business that we were going 
to take on. But we did decide that there might 
be a way for us to just do it ourselves, something that wouldn't cost us anything, to just 
sort of see what we could do with the idea. 
We both asked friends of ours to start writing 
stories about things in their lives that they 
weren't seeing reflected anywhere in the 
media, the real lives of women. I worked with 
a bunch of designers at Nickelodeon, and 
they helped to lay it out on the computer and 
we printed it and xeroxed it ... so we did that, 
we xeroxed and stapled 500 copies, and hence 
the first issue of Bust was born in 1993. 

How did you get the magazine's readership 
to grow so quickly? 

With that first issue, we went around to 
stores, and said, "Would you sell our magazine?" and brought around 500 copies ... but 
we really didn't think too much of it, it had 
been fun to make, we didn't know what 
would happen with it. And all of a sudden we 
started to get fan mail and orders for the magazine and we had to xerox and staple an additional 500 copies-this was all done furtively 
in the offices of Viacom. It wasn't a magazine 
then, it was totally a zine. It still is, but it 
could now enter a party of magazines, it could 
pass-it could get past the red rope, baby. A 
bunch of people we'd sent it off to, to see if 
they'd be interested in distributing it, said, this 
is kind of a cool idea, but we really can't sell 
this 
stupid 
thing 
that's 
xeroxed 
and 
stapled ... if you want us to distribute it, you 
have to get it printed. So Marcelle and I both 
reached into our pockets and took out $500 
each, and so for $1000 we printed 3000 
copies of the second issue. Also, I knew a girl 
from Nickelodeon who had a really cool artistic 
sensibility and always had pictures of Yoko 
Ono and Nico hanging over her desk, and we 
asked her if she would take on the project of 
getting Bust designed, and she said yes. So the 
second issue started to look more like Bust as 
you know it today, although it was really small 
and it was on newsprint. With every issue we 
got some monies coming in from subscribers, 
and we also started selling ads. We learned as 
we were going on. I had never edited before, 
Laurie had never designed a magazine, so we 
all learned about those things. 

When did the website become part of the 
project? [http://www.bust.com] 

As soon as I started to learn how to make 
websites I started trying to make a Bust website-it's been there since very early on in the 
web, even back when you could only have 
grey backgrounds. We used to have text from 
the first issue available on a gopher, in fact. 
We were always trying to distribute it electronically. I even got a Hypercard version of 
Bust in AOL. Because I did computer stuff I 
was always trying to use that to get the word 
of Bust out. Now the website is still one of our 
last priorities--here I am, a website designer, 
and our website really suffers from a lack of 
content. It's hard because Bust still doesn't pay 
us any money, now we distribute 30,000 
copies of the magazine, and we get written up, 
and I get e-mail from people saying, I want to 
work for Bust, here's my resume, and it's like, 
"Honey, as soon as we can hire ourselves we'll 
start thinking about hiring other people." 
Nobody makes one thin dime-Bust, like 
crime, doesn't pay. All the money that comes 
in goes back to printing the next issue of the 
magazine, and each issue that we've done has 
been better and more expensive than the last 
one. We're working on the twelfth issue now. 
We worked our way up to a four-color cover, 
and then we worked our way up to a shiny 
cover, then we worked our way up to shiny 
inside pages, and then having color on the 
inside pages--we're always pumping it in and 
making the magazine better. 

What was the impact of the Time story for 
Bust? 

We got a lot of work out of that. As soon 
as I saw that in the magazine, I said, oh God, 
OCTOBER 9, 1998
I'm going to get some phone calls ... there's 
really no such thing as bad publicity. Because 
of that magazine thousands and thousands 
more people heard about Bust. There was a 
buzz. 

Everyone expected Time to bash feminism; they've been doing it for years. Any 
time that feminism has a chance to get up on 
the podium and speak, even if only in 
response to a negative article, that's great. The 
real story of the '90s is the revamping of feminism, the makeover of feminism, how it's 
popular again. The Spice Girls are calling 
themselves feminists, eight year old girls are 
jumping around in their big sneakers and calling themselves feminists. When Bust was first 
started there was a smaller percentage of people who were willing to call themselves feminist. Now the girl power thing that was just 
starting to build when we started Bust is really 
widespread. 

The Time story was totally clueless. It was 
like, "Hello, postmodernism, hello, irony" ... I 
was really upset that all these feminists I know 
and respect were responding to the article, 
saying, "You're wrong, we are still doing grassroots work''-I'm sorry, but popular culture is 
really important, have we not realized that 
yet? What's in the popular culture is a really 
important reflection of where our value system is, and putting feminist products out into 
the popular culture is a way of making 
change. I don't think that putting out Bust is 
not as important as standing at abortion clinics and protesting against Operation Rescue ... I think that Sassy was one of the most 
important feminist things to happen in the 
last 15 years. So was Madonna and so was 
Courtney Love. One of the first things the 
women's movement did in the '70s was to go 
and protest the Miss America pageant, and to 
hold a sit-in in the Ladies' Home Journal offices. They realized back then the importance of pop culture. It was just weird that 
Time was saying that feminism now is just a 
bunch of vapid pop culture stuff ... and all 
these feminists who should know better are 
responding on their terms. A political strategy 
through popular culture is a valid way of dealing with things. It doesn't have to be apologized for.
