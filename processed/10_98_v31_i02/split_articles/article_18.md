tors who regret voting for the February deal. 
Nancy Baquie, a Wooster Square resident and 
member of the Trust's Executive Committee, 
complains of her exclusion from Bottomley's 
discussions with the Trust's chief negotiator, 
Robert Gnywacz. "Even I am not invited to 
the secret meetings," says Baquie. 
Although they are dissatisfied with Yale's 
behavior, the Friends of Hillhouse save their 
strongest words for their fellow preservation-
ists at the Trust. "There was absolute secrecy 
with 
no 
community 
involvement," 
com-
plains Jack 
Gold, a 
member of the Friends 
of Hillhouse who once 
worked as a preserva-
tionist for the city of 
New Haven. The parties 
to the negotiations give 
differing accounts. Yale 
Associate Vice President 
for 
Facilities 
Kemd 
Dawkins says, "It's not 
clear to me that there 
was this secrecy," while 
the Trust's 
Bottomley 
says that the planning was confidential. "Yale 
wanted it that way," he claims. 


Yale first made contact with the Trust in 
October 1996, according to Trust 
negotiator Gnywacz, an architect who 
also chairs the Trust's Preservation Action 
Committee. In November 1997, two repre-
sentatives of Yale's Office of Facilities and 
Office of New Haven and State Affairs met 
with Grzywacz. Yale came to the table with 
plans to demolish two of six properties, and 
ready to discuss the terms by which the other 
four would be restored, 
according 
to 
Grzywacz. Months of negotiations produced 
an agreement that committed Yale to the 
restoration of the badly damaged Davies 
Mansion, two decrepit houses on Hillhouse . 
Avenue, and the 18th cenrury John Pierpont 
House on Elm Street. Grzywacz and Bottom-
ley both pointed out that while they were 
unable to save Maple 
Cottage, they did con-
vince Yale to grant a 
one-year grace period 
for the Kingsley-Blake 
House across the street. 
(It currently houses the 
Ethics, 
Politics, 
and 
Economics 
Program.) 
Yale has agreed to give 
the structure to anyone 
who will take it, and has 
even offered $75,000 
toward 
the immense 
cost of physically mov-
ing an antique house.

ONE SIDE OF THE 
BUILDING, FARWELL 
BLAMES MAPLE COTTAGE'S 
CURRENT STATE ON 
TWENTY YEARS OF YALE 
OWNERSHIP. " THIS IS 
DEMOLITION BY 
NEGLECT," SHE SAYS. 

The trust also won significant concessions on 
the details of the restoration of the other four 
properties, according to trust officials. 


Trust officials like to focus on the Febru-
ary agreement's preamble, which recognizes 
that Yale's academic mission comes first and 
asserts, "Change is part of a continuously liv-
ing community." However, the agreement 
recognizes that "conscientious stewardship 
requires ... a careful balancing of preservation 
and change." The preamble also promises 
"continued consultation" on the six proper-
ties, but Grzywacz called the Friends of Hill-
house's claim that this clause permitted a new 
round of negotiations a misunderstanding. 


Members of the Friends of Hillhouse argue 
that the agreement lacks schedules and proce-
dures, and that its legal status is questionable. 


Many of the Friends of Hillhouse's com-
plaints center on the role of the Trust's Presi-
dent. "The plan was sprung on us," says one 
Trust Director, bookseller Nolan Smith. 
Another Director, Jack Gold, notes that Bot-
tomley's firm has done design work for the 
University and for Yale-New Haven Hospital. 
"I think that there are some clear confiias of 
interests on the board," he says. 


"I don't harbor any bitterness," says Bot-
tomley. "It's wonderful that there is so much 
interest in this issue." He denies having pres-
sured anyone into the agreement. "There was 
a three-hour meeting," he says, adding that 
copies of the agreement were mailed in 
advance to all board members. As foe the 
charge of a conflict of interest, Bottomley says 
his professional involvements were never a 
secret. "It's hard to be in this town and not 
have anything to do with Yale," says Bottom-
ley, a former Whiffenpoof. In the agreement 
he sees a chance to bring new clout to an 
organization that has lost more than half of its 
nearly 1,000 members in the last decade, and 
which has not had a full-time director in 
years. 


The tensions within the preservation 
community carne to the surf.l.ce at the 
State Historical Commission meeting 
in September. The Commission had to decide 
whether Yale's proposal to demolish Maple 
Cottage was "unreasonable" and then forward 
its recommendation to the State Attorney 
General for action. Both sides made long pre-
sentations; Grzywacz joined Yale representa-
tives and lawyers in vaunting Yale's record in 
preserving buildings like Linsly-Chittenden 
on Old Campus, while members of the 
Friends of Hillhouse defended Maple Cottage 
and suggested that Yale had acted in bad faith. 
Yale 
Assistant Vice 
President 
Michael 
Morand, who Â·works at the Office of New 
Haven and State Affairs, characterized the 
Friends of Hillhouse as paranoid. "There 
aren't any great conspiracies at work on this 
one," he says. Nonetheless, the Friends of 
Hillhouse argued suCCC!)Sfully that Yale and 
the Trust had not done enough research to 
determine the house's true value. The Com-
mission and Yale agreed that Yale will have 
until November 4 to assemble an indepen-
dent evaluation of the house and a more thor-
ough set of plans for the site. 


As President of the Trust, Bottomley is 
visibly proud of an agreement that produced a 
congratulatory letter from the President of the 
National Trust for Historic Preservation. It 
was a step into the limelight for an organiza-
tion best known for the oval plaques on scores 
of buildings around the city. And Grzywacz, 
who also chairs the Trust's Preservation Action 
Committee, enjoys the new, more personal 
relationship he has with Yale administrators 
after years of being ignored. Gnywacz now 
meets with Yale officials on a monthly basis. 
"Very frequently I'll be called [by Yale] once a 
week, just an informal telephone call," he 
says. Committed to the agreement in writing 
and in spirit, the New Haven Preservation 
Trust finds itself standing in for Yale in the 
battle against an activist wing of the preserva-
tion movement. 


Divide and conquer. It's worked for lead-
ers cannier than Richard Levin, and against 
opponents more fearsome than the New 
Haven Preservation Trust. But as the preserva-
tion community remains divided, Yale finds 
itself with allies and enemies in New Haven. 
Associate Vice President Dawkins winces at 
the mention of the many hours that Yale's 
new policy of community engagement has 
cost him. Nevertheless, he continues to meet 
with members of the Friends of Hillhouse, 
while his office maintains a close relationship 
with the Trust. Dawkins is frustrated by the 
delay in demolition, but he still supports the 
University's new direction. "What it demon-
strates is Yale's good intention," says Dawkins. 
And it is to the credit ofYale's new communi-
ty relations strategy that each preservationist 
&ction speaks of Dawkins with respect. As 
Yale and New Haven begin to move beyond 
their cautious overtures, the moment may 
have finally arrived when New Haven will 
abandon Yale as an all-purpose enemy, and 
accept the university as a powerful, if calculat-
ing, ally.
