t was the second weekend of the school year. Camp Yale was going 
strong, and rumors of the crackdown were flying. People were 
whispering. With Old Campus still crawling with parents, Yale 
police officers had arrived at a party in Vandetbilt Hall. "This year 
it's going to be different," a cop told T101 O'Meara (DC '00) as he ush-
ered people out of the room. A few days later, when police appeared at 
McClellan Hall, a cop said, "We don't want to have to do this, but we 
were told to crack down real hard the first month," according to 
Nathan Vasquez (TC '00). Students were getting carded at Viva's. 
Rudy's was turning people away. Naples and Gecko's were tightening 
their collars. Students were getting called on their f.tke IDs. 
There was talk of a party in the Boyd Swing Space where the under-
aged host was wasted on plastic-bottled Smirnoff and orange juice. He 
vomited repeatedly on his bed, mumbling about DUH and doctors. 
His friends called an ambulance. 
A cop arrived with the ambulance. "First thing be asked was, 'How 
is he?"' said Quinny Tan (DC '01). "The next second, he asked if the 
host was 21, and who had bought the drinks." The officer went on to 
explain that the police were now "taking action" against those who pur-
chased alcohol for minors. "He told us there was a new policy and then 
interrogated us, one by one," said Kyle Jarrow (SM '0 1). 


The pattern of the crackdown seemed to continue the next week-
end at Davenport's Cottage, a traditional party suite. Police arrived to 
break up a massive crowd that had gathered to hear the Sextones, a sru-
dent band, perform. Rumors swirled around the campus quickly, sug-
gesting that the police were overreacting to a party that, while huge in 
attendance, had a very relaxed atmosphere. When the cops told the

band to stop playing, and announced that the party was over, the crowd 
yelled obscenities. Marc Hoffman (ES '00) stepped up to the micro-
phone to protest the forced ending of the party. 
"He said, 'Why's the party over, ask them why!'" recalled Roberto 
Boneta (DC '00), a bystander. Then the situation got ugly. Boneta and 
others maintain that the officer told Hoffman to "get the fuck off the 
mic." Hoffman stepped away from the microphone and tried to discuss 
the situation with the officer, and, according to Boneta, the officer 
"pushed him hard." 
"The cop came towards me and I was between [Hoffman] and the ~ 
cop. I said, 'Officer, there's no need for violence,' and asked for his ~ 
badge number," Boneta said. The crowd, which had been watching the ; 
scene in shock, began shouting "Give us your badge number!" which ~ 
furthet infuriated the officer. "He ripped my shirt and grabbed my arm. i: 
I raised my hands in the air and said, 'I'm not doing anything.'" T he ~ 
officer then dragged Bonera, forcefully at first, to Davenport Dean ~ 
Larry Lyke, who Boneta claims saw the entire incident. "The dean told 2: 
me, 'Don't harass the officers.'" 


"The cop was definitdy out of line,'' said Peter Eleey (TC '00). 
Adam Seidman (ES '00) claims that a police officer shoved him as well. 
Yale Police Chief James Perrorti says no formal comp~ts have been 
filed with the Yale Police, and according to his official report of the inci-
dent, there was no misconduct. 
While most fdt the majority of the officers were courteous and 
restrained in a tense situation, the incident left a sour taste in the 
mouths of those srudents who had witnessed the behavior of the offi-
cers. Many saw Seidrnan~d Hoffinan, who now face the prospect of

an arrest warrant, as scapegoats for a raucous 
event. Executive Committee hearings are 
pending for the pair as well as several mem-
bers of the band and the .hosts of the party. 


T
he origin of the perceived crackdown 
had its roots last fall, when a drunken 
crew recruit was taken to Yale-New 
Haven Hospital. He told the police he had 
been served at Alpha Delta Phi's FunnelFest, a 
celebration of gravity and beer. A few days 
later, Yale Police arrested the fraternity's presi-
dent. 
Next to experience the pinch was Delta 
Kappa Epsilon's (DKE) Feb Club-a month 
of nightly parties aimed at relieving winter 
malaise. Though officials denied that they had 
used the widely distributed list of events to 
target locations, fraternity brothers ques-
tioned whether the administration and police 
were playing by unwritten rules. 
"They weren't just shutting down parties, 
but shutting down the parties before the fact," 
said Chris Ryan (BR '99), vice-president of 
DKE. "Residential college masters were call-
ing people into their offices and saying, 'Do 
not have this party.'" 
Then the administration came down hard 
on DKE sophomores Matt Manewal (BK '00) 
and Anthony Coyne (BK '00), who were 
caught with a keg by police responding to 
noise complaints. The pair faced Ex.Comm 
for serving to minors. "They told us it was by 
their own good graces that they didn't kick us 
out of school," said Manewal. With the newly 
applied pressure, DKE, Sigma Alpha Epsilon 
(SAE) and many other fraternities were hav-
ing fewer large parties, carding at the door, 
issuing armbands, and using phrases like "risk 
management" along with keg and tap in their 
party planning. 
University officials deny that there have 
been any changes in policy. But this fall, it 
seemed that parties were under fire wherever 
one looked~n-cunpus, off-campus, in frats, 
in apartments, in courtyards. "Since I was a 
freshman, there's been a step up in police 
activities," said Blake Sando (BK '99), presi: 
dent of SAE. "There's much more liability." 


The increased pressure seemed to make 
sense in light of recent national events. In the 
last two years, alcohol-related fatalities have 
hit more than a dozen schools across the 
nation, from MIT to Clarkson. But as the 
"H~ RIPPED MY SH I RT AND GRABBED 
MY ARM. I RAISED MY ARMS IN T H E 
AIR AND SAID, ' I'M NOT DOING 
ANYTHING:"' THE OFFICER THEN

LYKE, WHO BON ETA CLAIMS SAW THE

ME, 'DON'T HARASS THE OFFICERS."' 
death toll rises, students aren't getting the 
message. Researchers at Harvard's School of 
Public Health report that more and more col-
lege students are drinking in excess. College 
campuses are reacting with unprecedented 
regulations. Fraternities and campus houses 
have tightened measures at MIT, for example, 
and at state schools around the country, where 
police actually patrol the parties. 
During Dean of Student Affairs Betty 
Trachtenberg's tenure, Yale has escaped 
tragedy, but the dose calls make her uneasy. 
"We've had several cases this year where stu-
dents were as dose to death as they can be-
0.3 [blood] alcohol level and over." 


t's a common counter-argument to the 
idea of a crackdown: the cops are more 
active at the beginning of the year, and as 
the parrying dies down, their activity lessens. 
More likely than nor, there has been no offi-
cial change, but individual police officers are 
taking it upon themselves to send messages. 
With classes started and parties slowing down, 
perhaps university officials felt there was no 
need for further warning. 
But three weeks after the dosing of the 
Davenport Cottage party, the breakup of an 
off-campus party suggested this assumption 
might not be correct. The patty was called 
Crime and Punishment, held at 15 Edgewood 
Avenue. The cops arrived a litde after one. 
The atmosphere was relaxed; the band was 
too loud. By 1: 15 everyone had filed out to be 
greeted by 12 New Haven ~d Yale police 
cars. 
Ga.ty and · Mark were among the first to 
leave the party. "I saw this cop get up from his 
car, and he dropped his shoulder and checked 
Gary-he laid into him," Mark said. "I said, 
'What are you shoving me for?"' said Gary. 
"The cop replied, 'Because I want you to get 
the fuck out of here."' Gary moved on with 
the rest of the crowd, which was still exiting 
the party. 
Moments later, Gary. Mark and Andrew 
Fisher (SM '00) approached the officer. Mark 
asked politely for his name and badge num-
ber. "We were not confronrational," said Fish-
er, "but [the officer] grabbed Mark's arm, and 
waved the flashlight at us threateningly. He 
was swearing, real pissed. He yelled, 'You 
wanna file a complaint? I'll take you to my 
supervisor,' sarcastically." 
"If my friend hadn't been there to insist 
that he tell us, I was intimidated enough that 
I wouldn't have persisted," said Mark. "I 
intend to file a report." Judy Mongillo, repre-
sentative of the New Haven Police Depart-
ment, said she has no information about the 
incident. 


"A lot of students are complaining about 
being mistreated," said Yale College Council 
President Zachary Kaufinan (SY '00). "I 
understand that the police have a job to do, 
but it seems their conduct should be investi-
gated to make swe that they are operating 
within official police procedure." 


This sentiment is echoed by Julio Gonza-
lez (CC '99), Alderman of New Haven's Ward

One. "When you have vague standards, you 
have a selective enfor~ment," he said. "Stu-
dents have grown to believe that if it's a pri-
vate affair, signs [indicating the law] posted, 
and no disturbances, they are entitled to be 
left alone." It's what Gonzalez calls a "different 
culture of enforcement" that leads to the con-
fusion, and the so-called mixed messages such 
as: the JE master's house serves champagne to 
the public, yet sophomores are put on proba-
tion for getting caught with a keg. 


The reality is that both 
act with an implicit under-
standing of responsibility. 
Students 
may 
protest 
when the sophomores are 
punished, but this seems a 
petty price for a generous 
freedom. Yale is neither a 
boarding school nor Chico 
State. En wco parm~ 
the doctrine of the univer-
sity as protector-is alive 
and well, if sometimes 
misunderstood. 


While the university 
usually looks away from students drinking 
alcohol in their rooms, it must periodically 
make an example of people. By choosing to 
serve underage students, hosts must accept 
that they may get caught, may be made 
responsible, and may face litigation. The par-
ents of Scott Krueger, who died at MIT, are 
suing his fraternity. Sometimes, ExComm is 
the least of your worries. 


t's hard to reconcile a university crack-
down with Yale's alcohol-soaked history. 
In the 19th century, afTer all, rich Yalies 
were served beer by their butlers at breakfast. 
In the 1970s and '80s students drank beer 
almost exclusively-available at college-fund-
ed keg parties in the dining halls, no less-
with little adult supervision. In the mid '80s, 
Connecticut's drinking age increased, and the 
law was changed to ban serving alcohol to 
minors. The University adopted massive regu-
lations to protect against lawsuits, and the 
results were an end to dining hall bashes, a 
resurgence of fraterllities, an increase in police 
attention, and a more active Executive Com-
mittee. However, those measures certainly 
didn't eliminate traditions like Mory's, Tap 
Night, and TANG. 
"Another effect was that the drinking was

driven underground," said Associate Provost 
Uoyd Suttle, who was Dean of Student 
Affairs in the '80s. "People started drinking 
the hard stuff." Yale saw binge drinking 
become a lethal reality. Similar patterns fol-
lowed around the country. 
When Wtlliam Bennett was Master of Sil-
liman College in the mid '80s, he saw the rise 
of binge drinking. "They had these whiskey 
bars, where students would chug-a-lug 9, 10, 
11 shots." Bennett also witnessed Yale's most 
nounced dead. 
recent alcohol tragedy, the 
death of Silliman student 
Ted McGuire in 1987. 
McGuire began the 
evening at a SAC party in 
Saybrook. "Then he pol-
ished off a bottle of tequi-
la," said Bennett. "His 
friends carried him up five 
floors and lefr him on the 
floor to sleep it off." At 
6:30 in the morning, 
someone noticed he had 
stopped breathing. Several 
hours later he was pro-


It's frightening to discover how often such 
a tragedy is narrowly avoided. During this 
year's Tap Night, on September 23, a crowd 
of drunken singing group members were par-
tying in Branford. It was a splash of fun in an 
otherwise dreary evening, with Madonna 
pumping from inside and singers trading Tap 
Night war stories in the Branford courtyard. 
In the middle of the parry, a woman began 
complaining that she felt ill. Friends huddled 
around her, offering advice. She was blue, 
shivering, and periodically vomiting. 
"She was very sick, but I felt it wasn't a 
good idea to call DUH- it would have 
turned into a disciplinary problem," the host 
said. "Since it was my room, it would have 
gone into our files in the dean's office." Here, 
it seems, students finally bad the privacy they 
wanted, and none of the intrusion from the 
law that so many others had protested.
