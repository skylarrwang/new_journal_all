More women, yes?

When you stop and think about it, Yale's widely
heralded entry into women's education does not really
amount to very much. And even if you don't think that's
true, you can be pretty sure Kingman Brewster does.

In his address to the Yale alumni just a couple of
weeks ago, Brewster gave the clear impression that
he thinks of women undergraduates as accessory to
the real business of the college: turning out "one
thousand male leaders" each year.

"We can't give them women as a new gesture
every year," said the King, and the alumni chuckled.
And all betrayed their lack of comprehension of
what it's all about.

Not that this misunderstanding is new: it has
been present all the way through the long effort
to bring women to Yale. The attitude was most typ-
ically expressed in Henry Chauncey's statement on
a WAVZ radio special "The Year at Yale", when
he said that Yale was accepting women because a
Yale education was something which ought to be of-
fered to womankind. A combination of a concern for
attracting better men to Yale (for the best were
going elsewhere, where there were girls) and of a
desire to pacify the men who were already here
brought the first wave of five-hundred-odd women
to Yale. The "gesture", in the president's own
words, was made.

Unfortunately a realistic commitment to the
direction of a coed Yale was not also made at that
time. The same facilities were to be used for an
additional five hundred bodies. Everyone just had
to squeeze over, and for a while no one really com-
plained. They just figured, what the hell, having
girls here is worth the discomfort of sharing your
triple with a fourth guy. Also, of course, the
same faculty had to teach the greater number of stu-
dents, but that was alright too because the faculty
also liked the idea of having a few coeds around.

However, now that the girls have been here a
year things look a little different. That room which
was once a triple may soon be a quint. That seminar
which once had only ten people will have another
two or three people signing up every fall who wouldn't
have signed up before. Students, some of them any-
way, are becoming disgruntled with the results of
the president's gesture; girls are fine, but crowd-
ing is not.

But did we say "students"? Sorry. We must
be wary, for "students" and "men" must no long-
er be confused. As a rather startled Alumni Day gath-
ering discovered, the student body now includes a
healthy contingent of females, who also are not par-
ticularly content with their lot. So in addition to
the normal masculine agitation, a few feminine ruf-
fles and flourishes have been added to the annual
spring rites. At the Alumni Day luncheon the issue
was joined.

Overcrowding has been the main source of sup-
port for the idea that the number of men in each
class should be reduced. But overcrowding does not
just mean longer dining hall lines and less spacious
rooming arrangements; it means stretching the uni-
versity's already thin resources still thinner.

The matter of financial aid is the one which
makes or breaks the admissions policies. If there
is plenty of aid, any qualified applicant can come.
If there is not, then it becomes a case of first
paid, first served. In a recent speech, the soon de-
parting Dean of Admissions, R. Inslee Clark, warned
that the university may be nearing the end of the
line as far as the "open door" aid policy goes.

If the end, God forbid, is ever reached it's back to
Dink Stover days once again. And steadily increas-
ing the enrollment is not a good way of keeping that
financial door open.

It ought to be remembered as well that the uni-
versity backed into full coeducation in the first
place. Full integration of women into Yale's daily
life was not the original aim. Before coeducation
there was talk of transplanting a well-known women's
college to New Haven and assorted whispers about su-
perwealthy alumni who were going to set up a coor-
dinate college. We even heard, for a little while,
about something called "cluster" colleges, but
they disappeared even before they were explained.

When Coed Week happened Brewster plunged ahead
with an admirable damn-the-torpedoes attitude
which got girls here in a hurry, but which left
the future wide open.

Technically speaking, the future still is
wide open. Open admissions is not only desirable: it
is possible as well. Dean Clark has repeatedly
said he could find a goodly number of coeds to take
up the slack if the number of males in next year's
freshman class is cut. The Yale Daily News has
even quoted him as saying an open admissions policy
would produce a class composed of forty percent fe-
males. Although Clark says he could switch to an open
admissions policy as late as the third week in March,
he believes it will be "very difficult, not impos-
sible, but very difficult" after that. The ides of
March, then, is a real cut-off point. And the Yale
Corporation meeting on the first Saturday in March
may well be the deciding time.

If current plans are not changed, the back-
wards move into coeducation will have more and more
side effects as each annual step in Brewster's proj-
ect of incremental coeducation is implemented. Al-
though the president has asked the alumni for money
to build new colleges, they have not responded quick-
ly enough; there are, unfortunately, no concrete plans
laid out for the building of new residential colleges.
Instead the university is spending time and attention
on building a Social Science Center which probably
will be located on the choicest of all possible res-
idential spots: the block across from the Cross
Campus, the block now occupied by the Elizabethan
Club, Hendrie Hall, DUH and several other university-
owned buildings. If plans for the Social Science
Center continue as they are now envisioned, then
even when the residential colleges are finally built
they will be far away from the center of the campus
and far away from the rest of the students.

There is no particular reason why the Social
Science Center could not be built somewhere else - up
near the admissions office, for example, in the spot
now occupied by the geography department building
and the political science research library. It would be far
more sensible to have the Center up there than on prime
residential territory.

The plans as they now stand will put a squeeze on
housing in New Haven by encouraging students to move
off-campus in dissatisfied droves. Housing is already short
for graduate students and townspeople. In addition,
current plans would destroy the residential college system
by moving upperclassmen into temporary quarters out-
side the colleges and by scattering freshmen all over the
place.

Reducing the number of men in each class and increas-
ing the university's residential capacity are sequential
rather than either/or propositions. First one and then the
other. The real problem with organizing support for the
idea of cutting back on male admissions is that the plan
is so eminently reasonable: it simply makes more sense
in all terms - financial, moral, educational and
sociological - than the plan which the university has thus
far followed. It has its problems, of course, as every plan
does. For one thing it does not deal with alumni opinions
on any but a rational level, and we have all learned long
ago that alumni prejudices, rather than opinions, are
what really count. But if the alumni really expect Brew-
ster to fulfill his commitment to them to produce
"one thousand male leaders" each year, then the burden
is upon them to provide sufficient funds.

'This is all we know about life,'
said Peter Fonda, sectioning off a
corner of the coffee table with
his finger

by William Nelson

This winter Easy Rider opened in Ger-
many, a land whose economic prosperity,
social tensions and moral soul-searching
offers the closest parallels of any West-
ern nation to the current situation in
America. Free-lance writer William Nel-
son, Yale '66, talked with Peter Fonda
during the German dubbing of Easy
Rider in Munich and writes about the
Fonda phenomenon as it looks to an
American abroad.

There was no ivy climbing on the terrace
of Munich's Residence Hotel, and the
brisk weather hadn't carried a trace of
life-giving sunshine all day. No L.A.P.D.
helicopters were spying down from
above, but inside, with Peter Fonda,
was California.

When I entered his suite with Petra
Pauly, a German actress friend of mine,
Fonda rose and smiled a warm greeting.
He was dressed in Levis and a red ban-
dana shirt and barefoot, and his hair was
far longer than it had been on the screen.
Lifting his guitar off a chair so that we
both could sit facing him, he offered us
drinks. I asked for a beer and Petra a
tea, which Peter ordered from room ser-
vice. Happy with a bottle of water,
which is all he ever drinks, Peter set out
a dish of sunflower seeds, some pine
kernel packets, and a bag of dried cur-
rants (which Petra called raisins). I asked
if he were on a health food diet. He said
he wasn't, but his friend Bill Hayward,
who was with us at various times during
the interview, was. Bill said he didn't eat
meat because he didn't like to think of
the animals being killed. It was tough,
though; he said he really liked the taste
of meat.

As I was conducting a brief interview
for Overseas Weekly, a newspaper for
American forces in Europe, the military
was the first subject we took up. I posed
the obvious question that my GI reader
might ask: what would you do if you
were in the Army now?

"I'd go home," he answered dispas-
sionately, as if the matter were so re-
mote to him that he had to press his
imagination to come up with an answer.
"I'd go home, and they'd come and get
me and I'd go home again and again and
again until it just got too expensive for
them to keep bringing me back." Then
his eyes narrowed, and he leaned forward
to put an end to empty conjecture:
"Actually I never would be a GI though.
I'd never fight for any group - religious;
political - not anything like that."

Of course. What kind of an answer had
I been expecting? He saw I was smiling
as I jotted down the quote. "War is in-
sane," he went on. "I would kill to defend
myself, like if somebody was there about
to get me or my kids. But I would feel
weird killing someone and not eating the
body because a man should kill only to
eat."

"When you see somebody you don't
know," he went on, "you always wonder
whether this person wants to hurt you.
So you start to fear him. But what's the
point of that, man? Maybe he wants to
love you - you don't know. But it's the
nature of our governments to say that
he's going to hurt you."

The idea that this man had gained such a
large and attentive audience back home
- at the time Easy Rider was running
number three in nationwide box-office
draw - was somehow very satisfying.
I knew there was more to the peace move-
ment than protests; it strives for a change
not just in policies but in attitudes. If
Peter Fonda, as filmmaker and spokesman
for the movement, can effect some relief
from the fears and frustrations that lie at
the core of Vietnam and race discrimina-
tion, then perhaps there is a resolution in
sight for the schisms dividing America.
As a former part-time hippie I wanted to
bless him. But at the same time, as a
thinking man, I felt unwilling to take him
on faith. I felt the necessity to challenge
his vague abstractions: the peace move-
ment is too important to me to let it be
led by a follower.

The talk turned to Easy Rider, the
motorcycle-and-drug epic that has ele-
vated Peter Fonda from house freak (it
American International (The Wild Angels
and The Trip) to Hollywood's most suc-
cessful black sheep. Co-author and pro-
ducer as well as co-star of Easy Rider,
Fonda had come to Munich to supervise
the German dubbing of the film, which
already was running in France and soon
to open in Italy.

I had seen the English version at a
press showing that morning, and like the
critics whose reviews I had read in Amer-

ican magazines, I was greatly enthused at 
the idea. Still, except for its great land-
scape footage and the novelty of some 
very realistic pot-smoking scenes, I 
couldn't really get into the ftlm. What 
disturbed me about it was that while os-
tensibly making a plea for love, trust and 
understanding among men, it did so with 
plastic mock-ups. The sheriffs and red-
necks, presented to us as the embodiment 
of intolerance, are as anonymous as the 
hippies, who try to make love work. We 
distinguish between the two groups not 
by what they think and do or say as much 
as by the "role" which they have in the 
"life" of the ftlm. As a dramatic work 
Easy Rider fails; it seems more a propa-
ganda piece dependent upon pre-existing 
sympathies ~nd anxieties - not so much a 
tell-it-like-it-is statement as a tell-it-like-
we-figure-you-think-it-is-too bit. 


With an uneasy awareness that Amer-
ica seems to be dividing into two op-
posing camps, I asked Peter about this 
long-hair versus redneck polarity. He 
explained that Easy Rider is not simply 
about intolerance or injustice towards 
long-hairs. "It's not trying to say, look 
what they do to us," he told us. "It says, 
look what we're doing to ourselves. " 


Freedom, Peter said, at one point, 
is learning something, learning about 
life. He indicated the large glass-slab cof-
fee table before him. "If all of that is 
life," he said, and then sectioned off a 
corner of the table with his finger, "then 
this is as much as we know about it from 
our institutions - schools, churches, po-
lice, college degrees - or whatever your 
credo of the moment happens to be. This 
is what we call 'life.' But it's only a prison. 
All the rest of it - that's life too, and 
that's what we have to learn about.'' 


The talk soon came around to drugs, 
which seem to play as large a role in his 
life as in his film. Petra expressed her 
surprise that they smoked so much in 
Easy Rider; she said she knew they used 
a lot of drugs in California, but she had 
never seen it as depicted in the film. Peter 
shrugged in amusement as he leaned back 
on the couch. "Have you ever tried it?" 
he asked simply. No, she hadn't; she said 
she had wanted to, but she had never got-
ten around to it. Peter quoted the line 
spoken by Wyatt to George as he urges 
George to try a joint: ''That's all right. 
There's nothing to be ashamed of." He 
laughed. 


for a moment I felt a troubled sense 
of self-righteousness. I knew how nice it 
is to get stoned; I also know - too well -
how debilitating it can be if one comes 
to structure his perceptions and sensibil-
ities around its sweetly numbing euphoria 
- restricts his consciousness to the con-
tinual rediscovery of Old Truths. I wanted 
Peter to know I didn't need drugs - I 
even felt an urge to condemn him outright 
for using them as much as he evidently 
does. But gradually the abstinence I had 
imposed on myself since leaving California 
became ever more suspect - moralistical-
ly superficial - as Petra and Peter ex-
changed questioning grins. 


Why not? I had more than enough 
quotes for all the anti-war, ·pro-love articles 
the Overseas Weekly would run in the 
next ten years. From the cold, clear real-
ity of being "straight" I had a fairly good 
impression of who Peter Fonda was; I had 
gained a basic idea of his conception of 
the film. But the most persuasive argument 
for going ahead and turning on then and 
there was my feeling that Peter Fonda's 
natural state is high. It was a point of 
journalistic integrity. 


I got ripped. But Petra, who doesn't 
smoke at all, had difficulty getting the 
hang of it. Always the perfect host - but 
relaxed, unprepossessing- Peter took 
pains to explain to her the finer points 
of inhaling. He was well stoked himself, 
but entirely in control of himself and the 
situation. 


As we sat back to enjoy the high our 
roles as journalist and celebrity seemed 
to dissipate in the moment's happy ex-
hilaration. We all seemed immensely re-
lieved and set about to reacquaint our-
selves as friends and smoking companions. 


All of a sudden Petra announced, "I'm 
really very pleased how things turned 
out." We had both read Rex Reed's 
lengthy interview with Peter before com-
ing and had expected we would be talk-
ing with a floundering, embittered acid-
head, which is more or less the impres-
sion created by the Reed article. Peter 
smiled as if to say, "See? This is what 
I am." 


We had an occasional laugh as we ex-
changed tales of drug lore, but as for the 
taking of drugs itself, Peter always spoke 
with a somewhat serious manner, friend-
ly but earnest. Drugs seemed to be 
neither a simple thrill for him nor the 
means to greater understanding. At one 
point Petra referred back to the coffee 
table diagram of life 
Peter quickly in-
terjected, "One doesn't learn about life 
through pot." A short time later, after 
a pause in the conversation, I asked if 
he took LSD often. He said he had taken 
about twenty trips, and then added, "I 
never take acid to get high." Laughing, I 
told him I had. 


He didn't deem to appreciate there-
mark, for LSD, as he said at one point, 
had kept him from complete mental 
breakdown. When I mentioned that I had 
been drinking a lot of good Munich beer 
since coming over, he looked at me with 
a smile of compassion. "I used to drink 
a lot myself," he said. Later he remarked, 
:'I don't drink any alcohol because it re-
minds me of bad times." 


A vague sense of paranoia was begin-
ning to creep over me. It was all too per-
fect, too comfortable, and in his pres-
ence I felt somehow unclean. His state-
ments, sr..>ken with an air both flippant 
and founded on conviction, seemed so 
sincere and yet so considered ; his 
positions so spontaneous and still firm, 
fixed - unassailable in the terms he was 
using. The seeming contradictions and 
frightening implications in what he was 
saying didn't seem to trouble him as 
much as the effort expended in articulating 
his thoughts. 


Petra remarked that it must be nice to 
have made so much money (Columbia 
expects Easy Rider, which at the time 
had already grossed $3.5 million, to bring 
in over sixty million) from something 
he believed in. He nodded with a smile, 
"Yeah, it is." When she asked whether he 
is trying to fight the system, he reacted 
with curious surprise. "Fighting the sys-
tem doesn't get you anywhere," he 
told her. "They've got more on their 
side, they'll win. Don't fight the system 
- become it." 


As his face rippled ever so slightly -
looking now like a long-haired William 
Buckley, now like a haggard Vanessa 
Redgrave - it struck me that he might be 
putting me on. On the one hand he had 
pitted himself squarely against the 
American Establishment - at least the 
rednecks, the militarists, the DDT-sprayers 
- but on the other he seemed so en-
tirely a product of it that I wondered 
to what extent he could ever be outside 
of it. Still, I wanted to believe in his 
sincerity, and I searched for something 
that would restore my confidence. 


The talk turned back to his film. Here, 
it seemed, was neutral ground; we could 
all share in the pleasure of rapping about 
that. He told us that he had had the idea 
for a couple of years. It took him some 
time to interest others in the project, but 
Dennis Hopper, who he said had been 
black-listed in Hollywood for eight years, 
thought it was a good idea and started 
working with him on it. 


Peter spoke fondly, proudly about the 
making of the ftlm as if it were a labor 
of love that proved something. Whereas 
several reviewers created the impression 
that it was a hastily conceived, crudely 
made ftlm, listening to Peter talk about 
it showed me how considered every shot 
and sequence were. Hopper worked with 
an unusually high ratio of footage shot 
to footage used; the New Orleans Mardi 
Gras sequence, for one example, ~as 
selected from four hours of footage. 


As origin-ally conceived the film was 
a kind of close-up documentary on two 
modern-day California-style folk heroes, 
and everything was to have been shown 
in great detail. When Petra asked whether 
the bikes - Fonda had designed his own 
- were comfortable to ride, he said he 
got so stiff it hurt, and this too was to 
have been depicted in a sequence where 
they are barely able to dismount. 


The fmished film only hints at Wyatt 
and Billy's background as stuntmen who 
tour the rodeo circuit, but as first con-
ceived, the story opens at their last 
performance. If the film seems trippy as 
it was released, the heads would have 
blown their easy riding minds on this 
earlier version. According to Peter, Cap-
tain America was first to have driven 
through a flaming wooden tunnel on his 
motorcycle. Not simply a dare-devil stunt, 
it calls into play technological awareness: 
the low pressure pocket formed at his back 
collapses the sections of the tunnel behind 
him as he races through. The closing 
feat of the show, announced as Captain 
America's final stunt, is something called 
the "Paper Coffin." Wyatt is wheeled out 
inside a paper coffin lined with twenty 
sticks of dynamite evenly spaced out 
around the framework. The dynamite is 
exploded all at the same time, and Cap-
tain America, lying at the center of the 
radially counter-balanced explosion, 
rises up unharmed. 


"Of course, if three of the sticks don't 
go off," he said with a modest grin, 
" then it's all over, because you're blasted 
out on that side." He said he sold the 
ftlm just on a description of the stunt. 
"It would have been a great number," 
he added. "Steve McQueen has been 
doing his own jumps, and I figured, 
hell, I'd do it myself." 


He had invited us to have dinner with 
him in the suite, and the silence that fol-
lowed the dynamite story was broken 
by the knock of the bellboy bringing the 
meal. We rolled the table in, arranged 
chairs before it and sat down to a very 
fine dinner. We laughed occasionally 
when one of us looked up to see the 
others looking up too; we talked about 
why we had laughed. For the most part, 
though, the meal was silent since we had 
to concentrate on the task of eating. 


Petra and Peter both had veal steaks, 
and I had a mixed grill. I guess. 


Peter didn't like being referred to as 
a Californian, and at one point he 
told Petra rather emphatically that she 
had to distinguish between southern 
and northern California. Although he 
has been living in Beverly Hills for most 
of his adult life, Peter considers himself 
"from New York." Towards the end of 
the dinner I asked him if he felt at home 
in New York. " I've lived there on and 
off since I was fourteen," he said. "I 
was about to flip out there once when 
I was sixteen. When I was there I would go 
out and walk around for hours and then 
come home. But no, man, I don't feel at 
home there. I used to look at everything, 
but there was nothing there, man, nothing 
on the streets. No bread, nothing." 


After dinner he took up his twelve-
string guitar and played for us "The 
Ballad of Easy Rider," the song written 
for the film by Roger McGuinn. A left· 
hander, he had reversed the strings on 
the guitar; he said he couldn't really read 
music, but he had picked up guitar 
playing sitting around hotel rooms in the 
evening. 


The rest of the music of Easy Rider 
consists of populai songs that Peter told 
us had been selected for theii appro-
pria~ness, not because they were in. l 
asked if he had tried to get Bob Dylan 
to sing his "It's Alright Ma" himself in 
the ftlm's soundtrack (the song is done 
by McGuinn in the ftlm). Peter said that 
Dylan was going to do it at first, but he 
thought it would be too depressing; " It 
wouldn't leave the audience with a feeling 
of hope." Dylan told him he didn't like 
his own voice, didn't think it would con-
tribute to the end of the ftlm. So in· 
stead, he wrote two new verses for it. 


Peter sang the song with the two new 
verses. 


The evening slipped away with Peter 
playing his guitar and singing a number 
of songs by Dylan, Mick Jagger and the 
Beatles. Every so often he would 
apologize for making a mistake;. we as-
sured him it sounded great, and he con-
tinued. He likes playing for people, he 
said at one point; " It's hiding behind my 
act. Usually I have a camera or my acting 
to hide behind, but when I don't have 
them, I pick up my guitar." 


As I listened to him play I was moved 
to think again about him. I doubt he 
could knowingly do harm to anything, 
except perhaps himself. Always pleasant; 
when challenged, always self-effacing 
while bearing out the higher truths of 
love and peace. Always trying to be honest 
and open, but somehow, I thought, not 
really there. He didn't seem a· person a~ 
much'as a composite of the right ideas, 
the embodiment of so many good - even 
Christian - virtues. To say that he has 
hang-ups of his own is only stating the 
obvious, and Fonda himself, would be the 
first to decry his failings: humility, 
another Christian virtue, asked as much 
of him. But the person who can come to 
grips with these hang-ups and try to ef-
fect some sort of resolution, the person 
who can do something about the problems 
confronting America beyond making 
very generalized comments and emotion-
charged assignations of guilt, seemed to 
me, sadly, not to be present. 


At one point he told us about a sound 
technician at Bavaria Studios in Munich 
where easy Rider was being dubbed. 
The man, a friend had told Peter, had 
been a Communist all his life, something 
like seventy years. Peter chuckled when 
he thought about it ; he looked up with 
a grin: "Man, can you imagine being 
anything for seventy years?"

Schooling has nudged out religion 
as the opiate of the masses 
by Sam Miller 
If, as they say, a man can be judged by 
the enemies he makes, then Ivan Wich is 
a man who must be taken seriously. Ac-
cused of witchcraft, interdicted as rebel 
and heretic, dismissed as hopelessly 
Utopian, condemned as a raving mad-
man, Ivan Illich has succeeded in reaping 
the bitter criticism of an extraordinary 
array of people, ranging from the Pope to 
assorted presidents of the PTA. 

Who is this man Illich anyway? Or-
dained a priest (and later relieved of his 
priestly duties upon his own request), he 
has turned his brilliant wit and Thomistic 
training against the traditional hierarchy 
of Rome and the new theologies of 
middle-class consumption and formal 
schooling. He recently unsettled overflow 
crowds at the Yale Law School Auditori-
um with a three-day lecture series in 
which he challenged both conventional 
and current orthodoxies and called for 
a moratorium on institutional education. 
lllich has become the unwilling and 
perhaps inappropriate hero for reformers 
of the Catholic left. Yet he considers 
himself to be quite traditional. Feared as 
a revolutionary, he does not advocate 
violence and refrains from embracing a 
fLXed ideology. He is just as ardent in his 
criticism of socialist Cuba as fascist 
Brazil. 

Trained in and dedicated to the tradi-
tional teachings of the Church, Illich 
seems closer to an early Christian than a 
modern dissenter. For this reason, he 
poses perhaps an even more unsettling 
threat to those who uphold the status 
quo, be they Red or Red-White-and-Blue. 
The essence of his statement leaps 
ideological barriers. His commitment is 
to a radical humanism and his challenge 
is to conventional hierarchies, whether 
in Moscow or Kansas City. 

lllich does not favor one government 
over another; rather he blasts all ideologies 
and promises which alienate men from 
their traditional sources of dignity. He is 
especially vehement in his criticism of 
the liberal, middle-class assumptions un-
derlying the "fundamental mindless 
simplicity of Ame~ican reformers" who 
wreak havoc throughout the Third World 
in the name of progress and democracy. 

He was born in Vienna in 1926, the 
son of a Croatian Catholic father and 
a Sephardic Jewish mother. The lean, 
dark-skinned Illich has lived on three con-
tinents and professes to be "illiterate in 
eight languages." He was educated in 
Vienna, Salzburg, and Rome (where he 
was ordained). In his career he has served 
in a Puerto Rican parish in New York, 
as vice-chancellor of the Catholic Uni-
versity of Puerto Rico, and for the last 
eight years, as director of the Center for 
Inter-Cultural Documentation (CIDOC) 
in Cuernavaca, Mexico. 

CIDOC was established in 1961 as a 
training center for North American priests 
and nuns assigned to parishes throughout 
Latin America. Under Illich's tutelage, 
it has also become a gathering place for 
intellectuals and radicals from all con-
tinents and a publishing house for docu-
ments relating to violence and insurrection 
in Latin America. As such, the Center has 
attracted the scrutiny of security agents 
and provoked the Papal ire. Illich further 
alienated Church officials by condemning 
North American missionaries as the 
ignorant vehicles of United States cul-
tural imperialism. 

In June 1968, Vatican authorities sum-
moned Illich to Rome and subjected him 
to a Gothic inquisition on his theological 
and political views. The questions pre-
pared by the Vatican reflected a combina-
tion of fact, rumor and innuendo con-
cerning Illich and his center. He had fallen 
out of favor with Rome some time ago, 
when he turned away from a promising 
career in Church scholarship and diplo-
macy. Papal displeasure turned to sus-
picion of witchcraft after Illich told a 
Latin American bishop in a casual airplane 
conversation that he had been initiated 
in some of the rites of Haitian voodoo. 

CIDOC, which had become associated 
with criticism of the Papal policy of 
priestly celibacy and the use of contra-
ceptives, had come to be regarded as 
a dangerous threat. 

Among the eighty-five questions of 
the written interrogation were the 
following: 

What is your thought on the nationalism 
of states, on international Marxism and 
on Catholicism in religious, political, 
social and economic world order"! 

What do you say about those who say 
you are "restless, adventurous, imprudent. 
fanatical, and hypnotizing - a rebel to 
any authority. disposed to accept and 
recognaze only that of the Bishop of 
Cuernavaca"! 

Is it true that in the neighborhood of


Is it true that various publications of 
CIDOC readily and avidly print articles 
containing communist propaganda, as 
well as qualified comments on religion 
in general, and anti-Catholic thought in 
particular? 

. Illich refused to take an oath of secrecy 
or to answer the questions. He argued 
that since he had been relieved of his 
priestly duties upon his own request, the 
Vatican lacked jurisdiction over his 
activities. As a result of this encounter, the 
Vatican declared CIDOC off-limits to 
clerical personnel in January 1969 and all 
but branded Illich a heretic. 

Despite this controversy, Illich, now of-
ficially a layman, still considers himself 
a Catholic. He does not regard "a mere 
disagreement with one Pope or another, 
as grounds for abandoning the Church. 
Unperturbed by his·run-in with Rome, 
Illich has continued to press his attack on 
the cultural imperialism of Western re-
formers. In an interview published last 
July in Saturday Review, Illich stated his 
views as follows: 

The war fought to preserve the values 
of the West is one war fought in three 
theaters (Vietnam, ghettoes, and the Third 
World). It has one purpose - to protect 
and expand the style of life and the style 
of death which affluence makes possible 
for a very few and which the affluent 
declare obligatory for all. It is not the 
American way of life lived by the mil-
lions which sickens the billions, but the 
growing awareness that those who live 
the American way will not tire before the 
superiority of their quasi-religious per-
suasion will be accepted by the underdogs. 

In his recent visit to Yale, under the 
sponsorship of the Lyman Beecher lecture 
series, Dlich focused his attack on what 
he considers the most subtle yet most 
dangerous instrument of cultural imperi-
alism - the American "eight-lane" school 
system. Across all frontiers of culture, 
ideology and geography, he believes na-
tions of the Third World are becoming 
hooked on the conception that learning 
can only take place in school. lllich be-
lieves that the need for formal schooling 
~as become an almost universally-accepted 
sacred cow, a world-wide religi~n to which 
all pay homage. And without education, 
no one is saved. 

Illich argues that by accepting the need 
for schools, Third World nations pursue 
" the absolutely certain way of remaining 
inferior., The high cost of building schools 
and training teachers, says Illich, turns ed-
ucation into a scarce resource which can 
only be enjoyed by the rich. All Latin 
American nations, for example, are 
frantically intent on expanding their 
school systems in an effort to assert their 
national identity in the international edu-
cational hierarchy. No country in Latin 
America spends less than the equivalent 
of eighteen percent of their tax-derived 
public income on education, and many 
countries spend almost double that 
amount. But in spite of such huge invest-
ment, no country yet succeeds in provid-
ing five full years of public education to 
more than one-third of its population. 

"Bolivia,, IJJich says, "is on the way to 
suicide from an overdose of schooling." 

In this miserably poor and backward 
country, one-third of the public budget 
is dedicated to education. But because 
schools are accessible only to an infini-
tesimal portion of the country's in-
habitants, one-half of all funds allocated 
to public education are spent by only 
one percent of the school population. 

While less than two percent of all Bolivians 
finish high school, university students, 
almost exclusively from the upper and 
middle classes, receive 1 000 times the 
share of public expenditures enjoyed by 
the average citizen. 

This situation, common though 
perhaps not so pronounced throughout 
the Third World, is what Hlich terms 
"chronic educational underdevelopment." 
Utterly convinced that education cannot 
be separated from schooling, the illiterate 
masses provide tax monies to school the 
privileged few. The inevitable result is 
what lllich calls the "school pyramid" 
in which the vast majority of the popula-
tion surrenders their right to learning for 
the schooling of the rich. 

Even more devastating than the grossly 
inequitable distribution of resources 
fostered by the school system is the 
overwhelming sense of school-inflicted 
inferiority imposed upon those who don't 
attend. What schools teach, asserts lllich, 
is the importance of schooling - not 
worthwhile trades or any humanly im-
portant attitude or skill. Serving as a 
baby-sitter in which success is measured 
by the amount of time spent in class, by 
years and hours, not by human achieve-
ment, "schools destroy more individuals 
than they liberate." 

Worse yet, school serves to legitimize 
existing social and economic distinctions, 
in which the number of years in school 
rather than birth or station determines 
a modern substitute for class and caste. 
"Schools," he wrote in an article re-
cently published in the New York Review 
of Books, "rationalize the divine origins 
of social stratification with much more 
rigor than churches have ever done." 

Glorifying order and conformity, the 
school system justifies the position of 
the middle class. A far more effective and 
demanding drug than the opium of re-
ligion, the demand for schooling con-
vinces the drop-out, the second-rater and 
the unschooled of a deep-seated sense of 
inferiority for which he is held personaJiy 
responsible. 

But perhaps the most fundamental 
critique which IUich levies against the 
school system is the one which brings his 
thoughts back home to the United States. 
He believes that the age-specific, teacher-
related, graded and obligatory school 
system to which we are subjected is 
ultimately responsible for "the death of 
the imagination and the poisoning of 
the mind." The school vulgarizes learning 
much as the whorehouse vulgarizes love, 
lllich says. One of the great tragedies of 
modem times, lllich maintains, is that the 
basic human need for learning has been 
alienated into the need for being taught -
institutionally taught. As a result, whores 
and teachers have assumed the same social 
function. '-whoring and teaching," he 
says, "must be seen as the professionaliza-
tion of the need for Jove and the need for 
learning." 

With the advent of universal, com-
pulsory schooling, education has become 
devoid of human value and real learning, 
that is, "the awakening awareness of new 
levels of human potential and the use of 
one's creative power to foster human 
life," has been cast aside. Instead, edu-
cation has come to mean promotion from 
one level of a pre-packaged curriculum 
to another. 

In a real sense then, school assumes the 
vital function of socializing the fledgling 
citizen to the pre-packaged, engineered 
products of a modern, technological 
society. In that schools have secured a 
monopoly on modem learning, they have 
consequently gained an exclusive patent 
on the generation of common sense. The 
ritual of compulsory schooling permits 
the "industrial production of common 
sense" and promotes an unquestioning 
acquiescence to an engineered reality. 

The student in school is turned into a 
child. "We need schools," he quips, "to 
degrade our offspring into children." 

And the child is schooled in the three 
fundamental pillars of our society: speed, 
efficiency and competition. 

Cut off from reality by rigid institu-
tional barriers, the student is trained for 
the built-in obsolescence of a technologi-
cal age. He learns to belittle human re-
lationships and discard them. And more 
important, he learns to need the "pack-
age deals" which keep American society 
rolling. Accustomed.to packaged curric-
ulum, he accepts also the packaged satis-
faction of his basic needs. Thirst becomes 
the desire for a Coke. The need for trans-
portation means nothing else than next 
year's model from GM. Health comes to 
mean heart transplants. 

Well introctrinated, the student goes 
from the schoolhouse to take his rightful 
place among the world's best bureaucrats. 
Armed with what lliich calls a "Mega- · 
hygenic world view," the student becomes 
a citizen of the modern world: he is \ eady 
to consume. Convinced that the American 
way can't be beat (no doubt his high 
school was number one in the state), he 
benevolently imposes a straight jacket of 
traffic jams, production lines and class-
rooms on the poor nations of the world. 
and by international agreement calls this 
"development." 

Perhaps it's already too late. Perhaps 
we've already been programmed into 
believing that cars, heart transplants and 
classrooms are necessary to human exis-
tence. So persuasive is the power of the 
institutions we have created that they 
not only shape our preferences. but limit 
our sense of possibilities. Yet if man is 
to survive, his humanity must overcome 
his institutions. This is what lllich is say-
ing. His attack on schooling is a funda-
mental challenge to the accepted pre-
cepts of what he calls our "Machined so-
ciety." In raising his voice against the 
degrading and discriminatory school sys-

Sure it's warm, honey, but is it art? 
Filling the sculpture garden of the Mu-
seum of Modem Art in New York for a 
two-month period that ended last week 
was a complex network of wires, tubes 
and lights. The electronic apparatus was 
part of a Museum exhibition entitled 
"Spaces" and its tangled wires wound 
their way as far, in one sense, as New 
Haven, for the seven artists who created 
the exhibit are all affiliated with Yale. 
Calling themselves the Yale Research 
Associates in Art - or, informally and 
according to the Modem Museum, 
~ - Patrick Clancy, Michael Cain, 
David Rumsey, William Crosby, William 
Duesing, Peter K.indlrnann and Paul 
Fuge began several years ago to develop 
modes of art aimed at the creation of 
programmed environments. In the MOMA 
garden an intricate system that involved 
blinking lights and infra-red heaters at-
tempted to create new zones of light, 
sound and heat within the existing dimen-
sions of the garden space. Pulsa artists, 
seated within the museum in a glass-
enclosed booth that overlooked the gar-
den, could change and control the 
electronic zones of light, sound and heat 
at wiD. 

The effect of the group's work is to 
heighten a person's awareness of his en-
vironment and his constantly changing 
relationship with that environment. This 
is done specifically with the use of 
various sensory stimulators - lights, 
speakers and infra-red heaters. These out-
puts are activated 6y two processes act-
ing either singly or together. One is via 
a pre-determined program which is fed 
into a signal synthesizer. The other is 
through information gathered directly 
from the environment, i.e., weather, local 
trafrJC, and movement within the environ-
ment. When a person passes by the 
sensors - video monitors and photo-elec-
tric eyes - the mechanism responds ac-
cordingly and defmes the movement in 
stroboscopic outputs of light, sound and 
heat. 

The Pulsa group's rrrst exhibition was 
held at the School of Art and Architec-
ture from April to August of 1968. Al-
though not as mechanically and electron-
ically complex as the system is now, the 
aluminium-foiled modules of the exhibi· 
tion contained speakers, strobes and 
fluorescent lights which were programmed 
to coordinate with musiC. Since this farst 
show, Pulsa has becom~ more popular, 
and the phenomenon has been exhibited 
at the Boston Public Gardens, where 
speakers and strobes were placed under-
water, and at the Yale Golf Course. The 
most recent Pulsa project was the 
"Spaces" exhibition at the Museum of 
Modem Art. 

As with past exhibitions, the MOMA 
show had something for everyone. For 
the psychedelic afiJCionado it was an
elaborate set-up of strobes, bleepers and 
infra-red heaters. The technology buff 
could de)jght in the synthesizing and lag 
effects created by a room full of sophis-
ticated machinery. But now that Pulsa 
has finally found its way into the mu-
seum, the question arises: What is its 
significance to the world of art? 

Though the Pulsa group shuns con-
-. ventional modes of expression and 
works against many established conven-
tions, their final product should be seen 
as within western artistic tradition. 
Rather than portray an environment in 
the illusionistic space of a canvas or in 
physical constructions as in sculpture, 
Pulsa recreates it in the dimension of our 
senses- in Jjght, sound and heat. But 
the exhibition is not meant to be the 
~ltimate light show. The project's cre-
ators see its effects as an addition to the 
environment which activates space in 
order to make the human participant 
more aware of his surroundings. For this 
reason it is signifkant that human pres-
ence affects the behavior of the ma-
chinery. This self-conscious reference 
back to the participant captures the es-
sence of modernism. 

This is done, however, at the expense 
of convention. The final creation is de-
void of physical support: It does not hang 
on a wall, sit on a table or stand on its 
own. It exists in experiential space - in-
deed, it creates one - not the plastic 
world of three dimensions. It requires 
the participant to co-ordinate his 
senses of sight, hearing and touch and in 
so doing gives him a defmition of his 
environment. 

ln many ways the conceptual level is 
as radical as the environment produced. 
Rather than a single signature, an ar-
bitrary name, Pulsa, is attached to the 
completed module. Individualism among 
the creators is suppressed in favor of 
the group identity. This image is more 
than superficial. Within the group, de-
cisions are collectively reached by dis-
cussion, rather than by individual contri-
butions. (The members of Pulsa, with 
their families, even Jjve together com-
mune-style in a farm in the Connecticut 
countryside.) By using this organic 
creation process, no one member is di-
rectly responsible for a particular inven-
tion, giving the creators an anonymity 
unseen in Western art since the Gothic 
period. 

Equally significant is that Pulsa cre-
ations are temporary objects. An environ· 
ment is set up, then dismantled and re-
moved. Contrary to one of the fmest 
traditions of American art, there is no 
exchange of art for capital. No one 
"owns" any of the exhibitions. Pulsa, 
reacting against elitism in art, aims to 
create something for public use, not pri-
vate prestige. Pulsa's next project will 
take this aim even farther. Sponsored by 
the Walker Art Museum in Minneapolis, 
the group will create an environment to 
celebrate the thawing of Minneapolis's 
lakes later this spring. The display will 
be in a public area free of the confines of 
an institution and free, as was not the case 
in New York, of any admission charge. 

Despite the admission charge and the 
somewhat parental, elite presence of 
MOMA, Pulsa functioned well within the 
museum's sculpture garden. But one 
could not avoid a certain irony. The gar-
den of the Museum of Modem Art, 
where generations had come to see 
Rodin, Maillol, Calder, Oldenburg, all 
the very latest in the avant-garde; now, 
with lights and beeps and bursts of 
heat, they aU seemed so ve.ry old. For 
at last, had come in their stead in the 
words of Claes Oldenburg, an art that did 
something other than sit on its ass in a 
museum.~

If you are worried about the CIA, you 
are also worried about Y11le, because so 
many Old Blues you hear of from time to 
time have prominently or quietly played 
the role of national security managers 
during the Cold War. If you are a ferreting 
idealist-to-radical, a would-be writer of 
exposes, you are tantalized by your 
certain knowledge that so many CIA men 
- plus many other men who have so in-
evitably used the CIA in building and 
protecting their careers - come and go 
in your local dining halls, lounges and 
tombs. You may be more tantalized (and 
quickly disquieted) by your first glimpses 
of what types of men these are, glimpses 
which suggest to your introspective mind 
that these men at least began their ca-
reers with moral sensibilities which re-
semble your own in 1970. At first, re-
minds Miles Copeland in The Game of 
Nations, CIA types were seen by the 
military establishment in somewhat the 
same light as that establishment sees you 
today, as "wild-eyed intellectuals whose 
colleges don't want them back." 

If you want to expose bankruptcy 
in our government, Miles Copeland has 
already done a good deal of your work 
for you. He reveals several varieties. To 
give only three examples: 
1. He states that the CIA helped arrange 
the overthrow of the only republican 
government Syria had after her indepen-
dence from French mandate, in favor of 
a little tin demagogue named Husni 
al-Zaim, in 1949. 
2. He reveals that American generals re-
cruited Nazis for service in the intelligence 
services of Third World nations friendly 
to us, when World War II was scarcely over. 
3. He reveals that, because of interdepart-
mental jealousies, failures of one agent 
to let another know he was in town, and 
the like, supposedly calculated American . 
diplomatic dealings with Nasser's Egypt 
have more closely resembled hide-and-seek 
scenes in Marx Brothers movies. 

The book is an insider's history of Ameri-
can crypto-diplomacy in the Middle East 
from early Cold War years to June, 1967. 
It concentrates on Nasser's Egypt. One 
of the main reasons The Game of Na-
tions is such an effective expose is 
that you needn't have any qualms about 
the goals of United States policy to be 
shocked by it. 

Miles Copeland was an insider. He was 
present when the CIA was created in 1949 
after having been Vice Counsel at our 
embassy in Syria. In 1955 he switched 
to the State Department to become head 
of its Middle East Policy Planning Com-
mittee, where he worked until he quit in 
1957 to work for a private consulting 
firm in the Mid-east. Copeland continued 
to do trouble-shooting and consulting 
work for our government, and perhaps 
others. And perhaps he still does. Accord-
ing to his dustcover notes, he is now a 
senior partner in a consulting firm. He 
lives in London, and perhaps for that 
reason (although if one believes con-
spiracy theories it is easy to imagine other 
reasons) his book appeared in England 
last fall while it is still awaited here in 
the country - where it should cause the 
most excitement. 

The finest exposes can only be written 
by such insiders, the few privileged peo-
ple who were so deeply involved in 
events that they can weave a convincing, 
complete fabric out of every thread of 
nuance and detail from the situations 
they were in. The major trouble with in-
siders' exposes is that questions must 
inevitably be raised about the motives 
of the authors, who presumably have un-
dergone striking shifts of allegiance as 
their roles changed from those of priv-
ileged participants to muckraking his-
torians. 

When Joe McGinnis wrote The Selling 
of the President 1968, he made it clear 
that he had only been a pseudo-insider on 
the Nixon PR team, a journalist in huck-
ster's clothing. Knowing this, we accept 
his revelations easily not just because we 
dislike Nixon, but also because we under-
stand that as a sharp guy on the make 
he was working for himself through it all. 
He had no one's secrets to protect and 
had not been paid to be more fair to one 
interest than another. 

Miles Copeland's work is of a greater 
magnitude than The Selling of the Presi-
dent 1968, because McGinniss simply 
brought to life what anyone who watched 
television could have figured out was go-
ing on, somewhere. The Game of Nations, 
however, describes phenomena normal-
ly beyond our ken. But of Copeland we 
are also forced to ask that question, "Why 
did he, an ex-insider who for aU we know 
may stm be a professional insider in 
some counsels, write this expose?" -
a book which so clearly shows American 
diplomatic crusaders as Machiavellis, or 
worse, bumblers whom Machiavelli 
would have been the first to sack had 
he been in charge. The question is not 
wholly answerable from the book alone, 
but Copeland provides a partial explana-
tion in the beginning of his book. 

He claims his purpose is forthrightly 
to acquaint the public "and future his-
torians" with a little known and impor-
tant component of American diplo-
macy. He says he has revealed nothing 
which would violate either United States 
or British government security regula-
tions - unless, he adds, it has already 
been brought to light by previous es-
pionage leaks or journalists' coups. And 
he affirms " I have not...withheld any-
thing because of loyalty to the cabal." 

Fundamentally, Copeland seems testily 
determined not to allow pseudo-idealists 
to remain idealists in the public's eyes. 
He's out to destroy the 
View of our nation's statesmanship 
which they get, for example, from Robert

Kennedy's published account of the

Cuban crisis of 1962. Mr. Kennedy would •

and mankind,' sitting for hours in a 
room in the White House pondering 'our 
heritage and our ideals' and having re-
actions of 'shocked surprise' to the in-
stance of Soviet disingenuousness which 
had just been shown them. I believe that 
most intelligent citizens would be re-
lieved, not dismayed, to hear something 
nearer the truth: that there was not a man 
.,. 
in that room who was capable of 'shocked 
• 
surprise' at anything ... 

He then gives his own view. 
The top decision-makers of our govern-
ment have no intention of letting our 
future be determined by 'chicken' 
proficients [unpredictable, likely un-
friendly leaders] in Africa or Asia or any-
where else. There are limitations on what 
the government of a democratic country 
can do about its internal handicaps; 
there are none on what we can do in the 
country of others. Or, rather, when our 
Government decides what to do about 
other countries it is limited only by con-
siderations of effectiveness .... If we do 
not lie about our intentions or enter 
into treaties we don't intend to honour 
it is because such behavior is ineffective 
- and the fact remains. of course. that 
we do lie about our intentions and fail 
to abide by our treaties when it is in 
our advantage to do so and when we 
can get away with it .... Naturally, I am 
not defending such duplicity: I have no 
~ feeling about it o ne way or another. I 
only contend that it exists. 

Considering his sharp edge, I have a 
tendency to disbelieve that Miles Copeland 
has no feelings about that duplicity. Per-
haps the evolution of Copeland's personal 
ethical outlook towards crypto-diplo-
macy, his transition from insider to out-
sider, would make another kind of revela-
tion for future historians. 

The Game of Nations is more than just 
a competent account, however. First, 
it is beautifully, tightly written, full of 
dramatic episodes and unexpectedly 
twisted literary references - "The Game 
without Nasser is like Hamlet without 
Polonius." Second, it is really a serious 
study of Carnal Abdel Nasser as a type of 
Third World leader, also typified by 
Nkrumah of Ghana and Sukarno of In-
donesia, who is forced to keep power 
through repression of his countrymen 
and through demogogic exhortations and 
exploitation of chauvinistic nationalism 
and fanaticism. These leaders are forced 
into this position, Copeland points out, 
because realistic economic prospects for 
their nations are so totally hopeless that 
a constructively liberal course is impos-
sible politically. If they promise their 
people anything tangible, however small, 
they will not be able to fulfill their 
promises. Impoverished Egypt, with its 
skyrocketing birthrate, is perhaps the 
earth's most classically tragic example of 
this condition. 

In an implicit answer to theoreticians 
like Walt Rostow, Copeland advances 
his own multi-stage model for this political 
economic "progress" of revolutions in 
poor nations. There are three stages. In 
stage one, the revolution begins to trans-
form the traditional socio-political struc-
ture. Landlords are exiled and their fief-
doms broken up. The leadership begins 
to mobilize the people. In stage three, the 
revolution shows measurable positive in-
fluence upon the quality of everyday life 
in the country, and offers the people a 
modest new deal firmly based upon 
technocratic progress and graceful, unique 
incorporation of some traditional values.
But stage three can never be reached. 
Because to promise what cannot be de-
livered would alienate the masses and 
eventually undermine the Nasser-type 
leader, the leader exhorts the nation into 
regressive stage two and an indefinite 
limbo of political "displacement activity" 
of totalist propaganda, national cam-
paigns after pie-in-the-sky abstract goals 
and military crusades. At least, figures 
the harried (and at heart patriotic) despot, 
this constantly mobilized, constantly 
taut stage two is better than the old sleep 
of stage one. Many of his followers will 
agree with him, and Copeland shows 
sympathetically that there is a sort of 
logic behind their agreement. 

There were years when Miles Copeland, 
the insider, had lunched with Nasser once 
a week; he may know Nasser better than 
any other American. His book's most time-
ly gift to outsiders who normally depend 
on The New York Times for their image 
of Nasser and the Third World, is a clear 
isolation and explication of this sort of 
logic, the logic of frustration, the logic 
which, once grasped, can make "ir-
responsible, irrational" deeds of people like 
Arabs more fathomable. Even with all 
the tools of "crypto-diplomacy" Americans 
don't appreciate have-not systems 
of logic very much. As Copeland says 
himself, the failure to understand this 
logic can render even the powers of the 
CIA irrelevant. 

The best known methods of intelligence 
analysis- the [political simulation] 
Game, the CIA, the State Department, or 
whatever - have not proved up to pre-
dicting the actions of leaders of those 
countries of Africa, Asia and South Amer-
ica where the economic situation ap-
pears hopeless, where the gap between 
expectations and realization apparently 
can't be closed, where the people are 
frustrated, and where the leaders, if they 
are to stay in power, must either resort 
to demagoguery or discover new ways of 
squeezing more aid from the rich coun-
tries or both. 


**New Imperialism**
**Author: Bahman Nirumand**

Bahman Nirumand was an Iranian 
leftist student in Germany when he wrote 
his New Imperialism in 1967. His book 
is partly credited with stirring violent 
leftist student riots against the Shah during 
his German visit of 1967. It has recently 
been translated into English, and it is 
excellent. It documents, for example, how 
Western powers exploit Iranian oil, and 
how American development plans for 
Iran do not fit the needs of her people. 
The book, however, has to be seen - no 
matter how solid it is - as a foil to Cope-
land's classic. When Nirumand (an out-
sider) tries to document the CIA's role 
in the fall of the nationalist Mossadegh he 
is forced to quote old articles in the 
Saturday Evening Post. He cannot tell 
you what the engineers of the coup said 
in the car on the way out of the palace. 


**Intervention and Revolution**
**Author: Richard Barnet**
**Page number(s): 14**

The paperback edition of Richard Bar-
net's Intervention and Revolution, which 
has been on prominent display at the 
Yale Co-op recently, is a good inexpensive 
tour de force to place next to the copy 
of the Algiers Motel Incident on your 
radical bookshelf. Barnet covers the rise 
of the "National Security Manager" in 
American society, the interests and fears 
of these managers, and treats in a general 
way most of our interventions armed or 
political, open or clandestine, since the 
early days of the Cold War. His chapters 
on Vietnam can't say much new, but his 
chapters on Greece in 1948 (where we 
won) and other more obscure situations 
are useful. The comprehensive, metic-
ulously footnoted book corroborates 
much of what Nirumand and Copeland 
reveal, but Barnet often finds facts of his 
own. For example, Nirumand tells us 
that the CIA's director of the coup 
which deposed the Iranian nationalist 
Mossadegh in 1953 and restored a more 
"cooperative" Shah to power, was General 
Norman Schwartzkopf, former head of 
the New Jersey State Police. But does he 
remind us that this same Schwartzkopf had 
been a figure in the Lindbergh kidnapping 
case, and erstwhile narrator of the radio 
serial "Gangbusters?" No? Well, 
he was.


**De-Schooling Society**

continued from page 9 
tern, Illich calls into question the entire 
social fabric of modern society. 

Speaking at Yale, Illich urged his 
audience "to resist further school-building 
as some of you resist further war-making." 
He asserted that nations raise armies and 
schools with equal fervor; and that the 
drop-out is just as much a built-in con-
sequence of the school system as the 
dead soldier is a consequence of the mili-
tary. He claimed that the present school 
system "costs too much and damages 
too many children." 

His analysis was economic, but his con-
cern was ultimately humanistic. He chal-
lenged his audience to tear down the 
educational walls and advocated a "mas-
sive redistribution of the social functions 
pre-empted by schools to the other insti-
tutions of society." As an alternative to 
the formal institution which monopolizes 
learning and benefits only the elite, 
Illich proposed a decentralization of the 
learning process in order to insure equal 
access to educational resources for all 
citizens. He outlined a system in which 
each citizen at birth would be issued an 
"edu-card, a passport to learning" which 
would entitle him to utilize an allotment 
of public funds when and where he 
sees fit. 

During the first three years of infancy, 
a child's "edu-card" could be used by his 
mother so that she could learn to teach 
her offspring. Instead of cramming a life-
time of education into a few years of 
schooling, attendance at a learning center 
could be made obligatory for one or 
two months a year for all citizens be-
tween the ages of five and thirty. The rest 
of the year could be productively spent 
working, travelling, reading and ex-
periencing. With his card, the citizen 
could purchase access to parks, theaters, 
museums, libraries, trips, etc. He could 
also purchase the time of coaches, tutors, 
psychologists, or gurus. 

Illich's proposal is based on the con-
viction that most learning can take place 
without the guidance of a professional. 
He asserts that an educational system 
should embody three fundamental ob-
jectives: equal opportunity for personal 
freedom, universal preparation for social 
and political participation, and man-
power development for social and eco-
nomic institutions. These goals are in-
compatible with the institutionalized 
monopoly on education presently enjoyed 
by the school system. He feels that a 
citizenry motivated and conscious of the 
fact that education is a scarce resource 
will utilize their educational opportunities 
far more efficiently than under the 
present system. 

He also hopes that by decentralizing 
the learning process that "educational 
fraud could at least be reduced to the 
level of political fraud." He advocates the 
enactment of legislation in order to pro-
tect the citizen in his educational con-
sumption. There might be an extension of 
the first amendment to include non-dis-
crimination on the basis of years of school-
ing, and the establishment of anti-trust 
laws to prevent educational monopoly. 

Illich foresees the establishment of learn-
ing centers catering to specific skills and 
envisions the breakdown of the tradi-
tional barriers between work and educa-
tion through new forms of on-the-job 
training. 

Illich recognizes that the "de-schooling 
of society" will result in inequities. But 
he feels that the benefits far outweigh 
the disadvantages. No system, he main-
tains, can be as unjust and inequitable 
as the one we all take for granted. 

The chief significance of Illich's mes-
sage is a warning that we cannot afford 
to take our institutions for granted. 
"Twenty years ago," he remarked, "we 
did not by necessity believe that a 
military officer was a mad man. Today, 
we still don't believe this of university 
presidents." Yet schools, undeniably, can 
be just as lethal as bullets; perhaps even 
worse, for they destroy the mind. The 
commuter, caught in a traffic jam, be-
comes utterly convinced that the only 
solution is more expressways. Never does 
he stop to think that he would be better 
off without a car at all. Illich pointed 
out ironically to his audience that "ed-
ucated" men apply the same logic to 
schooling. 


**Yale Admissions**
**Author: Margaret Coon, George Kannar**

continued from page 2 
Furthermore, the plan to reduce 
the size of each Yale class (either 
permanently or until new colleges 
are built) better fulfills Yale's ob-
ligation to educate women as well as 
men. The Yale girls are not here as 
accessories to the Yale men; they are 
here on their own. They ought to be 
treated as full-fledged members of the 
community - and that means no discrim-
ination in admissions. 

There are other possibilities 
too. For example it would be possible 
to increase the university's enroll-
ment by twenty-five percent and run 
the university on a quarter system, 
so that the facilities would never be 
too crowded. They would just be used 
all year around. 

In the end, though, the situa-
tion for next year depends on what 
transpires at the Corporation meet-
ing of March 7th. Either a few more 
girls and much overcrowding or else 
considerably fewer men and many more 
women will result. It's in the self-
interest of everyone at Yale that the 
Corporation choose the second idea 
over the first. But, as you know, 
Mr. Brewster says they won't "unless 
it is absolutely necessary."


**Frank Talk on TV News**
**Author: Peter Kyros**

Frank talk on TV news
Reuven Frank is not your ordinary news-
man; he talks and dresses with the under-
stated detachment of a banker. It's be-
cause he's President of NBC news. For 
nine years before that he produced the 
Huntley-Brinkley Report. His view of 
television is clearly the product of his 
experience with the pressures of creat-
ing a daily news program. He seems to 
have come to terms with these pressures 
through a cool professionalism. He talks 
softly and smokes Larks, lots of them. 

Recently Mr. Frank was at Yale as a 
Poynter Fellow in Journalism. He showed 
films and talked about TV news to 
about two hundred persons in the Pierson 
dining hall. Mr. Frank was asked to bring 
the films of the Chicago Democratic Con-
vention. He couldn't, he said, because it 
was all live, and there are no archives of 
news programming. The networks keep 
everything they broadcast for a week, 
then erase it and tape again. Transcripts 
are made but they "just pile up." "Be-
sides," said Mr. Frank, "you can never 
really see it again in context. Television 
is momentary and instantaneous, and 
newspapers are for the record." 

This exchange is interrupted by the 
quick appearance of numbers, from eight 
on down, flashing on a movie screen. 
Suddenly Huntley and Brinkley become 
full-size people in color (movie color). 
The film, one of NBC's broadcasts from 
January of 1968, contains the first live 
pictures of the Tet offensive. American 
soldiers rid the American Embassy of VC, 
and Jack Perkins, the NBC reporter, com-
ments that "we were taken by surprise." 
Titters and applause come from the 
audience. 

The Vietnam film is unedited, broad-
cast from Tokyo through New York 
without being seen by Huntley, Brinkley 
or anybody. The reporters assure us that 
American bases are secure, and no cities 
could be taken. But the irony is lost in a 
rush of irate questions about the reporters' 
presumptions in giving those smug assur-
ances. The audience grumbles. Some ask 
whether NBC would consider doing a 
true documentary of the war in Vietnam. 
Mr. Frank's answer is another film. 

On screen: Frank McGee, March 10, 
.1968 - The New Year, The New War. 
It is a brutal documentary of the Tet 
offensive, starting with a peacock in liv-
ing color and the strangeness of TV on 
the Big Screen. 

First, film clips of President Johnson 
and Robert McNamara, each of them 
saying on successive dates from 1966 
through early 1968: "We are doing well." 
"We will not have to expand the conflict." 
A quick shot of Westmoreland on March 10, 
the day he asked for 206,000 more 
men saying: "We have taken the offensive 
from the enemy." There are the knowing 
cheers in the dining hall. 

Then, the war. Again, films of the 
American Embassy attack. This time 
clearer, well-edited, but the same con-
fusion is there, in the situation, not the 
editing, Saigon is burning; Hue is burn-
ing, and Frank McGee is droning on. All 
of the suspected VC sympathizers are 
"rounded up." 

A man is standing on the screen in 
profile - Vietnamese in a red plaid shirt. 
A police chief walks up and shoots him 
neatly in the temple; he crumples, some-
one attaches a piece of red cloth with a 
number to his belt. John Hersey, in the 
far corner of the room, stirs uneasily; he 
did not come for this. 

The reel ends, many people begin to 
leave, quietly - among them myself. 
There are few hands, few questions. 
Colors in the dining hall are drab, brown 
tables in disarray - Kodacolor is bright 
and real. Mr. Frank comes forward from 
the corner behind the screen, easily, 
lighting a cigarette. He is unperturbed, 
he is a producer: it was a good film then, 
it still is. Mr. Frank is watching us. 
"Journalism is a craft," he had said, 
"like good carpentry."


a very heavy amplifier indeed 
It has taken us at David Dean Smith a 
long time to find a medium priced 
amplifier that we could enthusiastically 
recommend and guarantee for two years-
parts and labor. 

Most amplifiers we tried had the following problems: 
they could never come near meeting their 
published specifications; they tended to have 
a transistory tinny sound; and occasionally 
they blew up. 

But we found the Pioneer 900, and all became 
well with the world. It easily produces sixty watts RMS 
a channel with both channels driven. (This is 
the same as 200 IHF watts.) But most important, 
it sounds incredibly fine. 

It costs two hundred and sixty dollars. Bring up 
some of your favorite Mayall, Clapton or Bach 
sides and listen to the Pioneer 900. 
Or listen to our copy of the Pentangle.

The Environmental 
Crisis: Man's Struggle to Live with Himself 
edited by Harold W. Helfrich, Jr. 
Ecological catastrophe threatens the very 
base of our sociopolitical structure. The 
combined scourges of water and air pollu-
tion, mismanaged national resources and 
open spaces, increasing and unplanned 
populations, urban congestion, and mis-
management of our national energies are 
creating human despair in the midst of un-
precedented technological advances. The 
papers in this book, representing a lecture 
series presented during 1968-69 at the 
School of Forestry at Yale University, deal 
with our survival in the face of the rapid 
deterioration of our natural surroundings. 
The contributors are among the most 
distinguished authorities in the fields of 
science, law, regional planning, economics, 
and government. Their commentaries arise 
from practical experience gained during 
outstanding careers and each provides a 
close examination of one of the ecological 
or ethical problems plaguing mankind, 
which, in their ultimate significance, over-
shadow wars, ideologies, and races.
