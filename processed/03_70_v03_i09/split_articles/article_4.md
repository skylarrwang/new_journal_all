Schooling has nudged out religion 
as the opiate of the masses 
by Sam Miller 
If, as they say, a man can be judged by 
the enemies he makes, then Ivan Wich is 
a man who must be taken seriously. Ac-
cused of witchcraft, interdicted as rebel 
and heretic, dismissed as hopelessly 
Utopian, condemned as a raving mad-
man, Ivan Illich has succeeded in reaping 
the bitter criticism of an extraordinary 
array of people, ranging from the Pope to 
assorted presidents of the PTA. 

Who is this man Illich anyway? Or-
dained a priest (and later relieved of his 
priestly duties upon his own request), he 
has turned his brilliant wit and Thomistic 
training against the traditional hierarchy 
of Rome and the new theologies of 
middle-class consumption and formal 
schooling. He recently unsettled overflow 
crowds at the Yale Law School Auditori-
um with a three-day lecture series in 
which he challenged both conventional 
and current orthodoxies and called for 
a moratorium on institutional education. 
lllich has become the unwilling and 
perhaps inappropriate hero for reformers 
of the Catholic left. Yet he considers 
himself to be quite traditional. Feared as 
a revolutionary, he does not advocate 
violence and refrains from embracing a 
fLXed ideology. He is just as ardent in his 
criticism of socialist Cuba as fascist 
Brazil. 

Trained in and dedicated to the tradi-
tional teachings of the Church, Illich 
seems closer to an early Christian than a 
modern dissenter. For this reason, he 
poses perhaps an even more unsettling 
threat to those who uphold the status 
quo, be they Red or Red-White-and-Blue. 
The essence of his statement leaps 
ideological barriers. His commitment is 
to a radical humanism and his challenge 
is to conventional hierarchies, whether 
in Moscow or Kansas City. 

lllich does not favor one government 
over another; rather he blasts all ideologies 
and promises which alienate men from 
their traditional sources of dignity. He is 
especially vehement in his criticism of 
the liberal, middle-class assumptions un-
derlying the "fundamental mindless 
simplicity of Ame~ican reformers" who 
wreak havoc throughout the Third World 
in the name of progress and democracy. 

He was born in Vienna in 1926, the 
son of a Croatian Catholic father and 
a Sephardic Jewish mother. The lean, 
dark-skinned Illich has lived on three con-
tinents and professes to be "illiterate in 
eight languages." He was educated in 
Vienna, Salzburg, and Rome (where he 
was ordained). In his career he has served 
in a Puerto Rican parish in New York, 
as vice-chancellor of the Catholic Uni-
versity of Puerto Rico, and for the last 
eight years, as director of the Center for 
Inter-Cultural Documentation (CIDOC) 
in Cuernavaca, Mexico. 

CIDOC was established in 1961 as a 
training center for North American priests 
and nuns assigned to parishes throughout 
Latin America. Under Illich's tutelage, 
it has also become a gathering place for 
intellectuals and radicals from all con-
tinents and a publishing house for docu-
ments relating to violence and insurrection 
in Latin America. As such, the Center has 
attracted the scrutiny of security agents 
and provoked the Papal ire. Illich further 
alienated Church officials by condemning 
North American missionaries as the 
ignorant vehicles of United States cul-
tural imperialism. 

In June 1968, Vatican authorities sum-
moned Illich to Rome and subjected him 
to a Gothic inquisition on his theological 
and political views. The questions pre-
pared by the Vatican reflected a combina-
tion of fact, rumor and innuendo con-
cerning Illich and his center. He had fallen 
out of favor with Rome some time ago, 
when he turned away from a promising 
career in Church scholarship and diplo-
macy. Papal displeasure turned to sus-
picion of witchcraft after Illich told a 
Latin American bishop in a casual airplane 
conversation that he had been initiated 
in some of the rites of Haitian voodoo. 

CIDOC, which had become associated 
with criticism of the Papal policy of 
priestly celibacy and the use of contra-
ceptives, had come to be regarded as 
a dangerous threat. 

Among the eighty-five questions of 
the written interrogation were the 
following: 

What is your thought on the nationalism 
of states, on international Marxism and 
on Catholicism in religious, political, 
social and economic world order"! 

What do you say about those who say 
you are "restless, adventurous, imprudent. 
fanatical, and hypnotizing - a rebel to 
any authority. disposed to accept and 
recognaze only that of the Bishop of 
Cuernavaca"! 

Is it true that in the neighborhood of


Is it true that various publications of 
CIDOC readily and avidly print articles 
containing communist propaganda, as 
well as qualified comments on religion 
in general, and anti-Catholic thought in 
particular? 

. Illich refused to take an oath of secrecy 
or to answer the questions. He argued 
that since he had been relieved of his 
priestly duties upon his own request, the 
Vatican lacked jurisdiction over his 
activities. As a result of this encounter, the 
Vatican declared CIDOC off-limits to 
clerical personnel in January 1969 and all 
but branded Illich a heretic. 

Despite this controversy, Illich, now of-
ficially a layman, still considers himself 
a Catholic. He does not regard "a mere 
disagreement with one Pope or another, 
as grounds for abandoning the Church. 
Unperturbed by his·run-in with Rome, 
Illich has continued to press his attack on 
the cultural imperialism of Western re-
formers. In an interview published last 
July in Saturday Review, Illich stated his 
views as follows: 

The war fought to preserve the values 
of the West is one war fought in three 
theaters (Vietnam, ghettoes, and the Third 
World). It has one purpose - to protect 
and expand the style of life and the style 
of death which affluence makes possible 
for a very few and which the affluent 
declare obligatory for all. It is not the 
American way of life lived by the mil-
lions which sickens the billions, but the 
growing awareness that those who live 
the American way will not tire before the 
superiority of their quasi-religious per-
suasion will be accepted by the underdogs. 

In his recent visit to Yale, under the 
sponsorship of the Lyman Beecher lecture 
series, Dlich focused his attack on what 
he considers the most subtle yet most 
dangerous instrument of cultural imperi-
alism - the American "eight-lane" school 
system. Across all frontiers of culture, 
ideology and geography, he believes na-
tions of the Third World are becoming 
hooked on the conception that learning 
can only take place in school. lllich be-
lieves that the need for formal schooling 
~as become an almost universally-accepted 
sacred cow, a world-wide religi~n to which 
all pay homage. And without education, 
no one is saved. 

Illich argues that by accepting the need 
for schools, Third World nations pursue 
" the absolutely certain way of remaining 
inferior., The high cost of building schools 
and training teachers, says Illich, turns ed-
ucation into a scarce resource which can 
only be enjoyed by the rich. All Latin 
American nations, for example, are 
frantically intent on expanding their 
school systems in an effort to assert their 
national identity in the international edu-
cational hierarchy. No country in Latin 
America spends less than the equivalent 
of eighteen percent of their tax-derived 
public income on education, and many 
countries spend almost double that 
amount. But in spite of such huge invest-
ment, no country yet succeeds in provid-
ing five full years of public education to 
more than one-third of its population. 

"Bolivia,, IJJich says, "is on the way to 
suicide from an overdose of schooling." 

In this miserably poor and backward 
country, one-third of the public budget 
is dedicated to education. But because 
schools are accessible only to an infini-
tesimal portion of the country's in-
habitants, one-half of all funds allocated 
to public education are spent by only 
one percent of the school population. 

While less than two percent of all Bolivians 
finish high school, university students, 
almost exclusively from the upper and 
middle classes, receive 1 000 times the 
share of public expenditures enjoyed by 
the average citizen. 

This situation, common though 
perhaps not so pronounced throughout 
the Third World, is what Hlich terms 
"chronic educational underdevelopment." 
Utterly convinced that education cannot 
be separated from schooling, the illiterate 
masses provide tax monies to school the 
privileged few. The inevitable result is 
what lllich calls the "school pyramid" 
in which the vast majority of the popula-
tion surrenders their right to learning for 
the schooling of the rich. 

Even more devastating than the grossly 
inequitable distribution of resources 
fostered by the school system is the 
overwhelming sense of school-inflicted 
inferiority imposed upon those who don't 
attend. What schools teach, asserts lllich, 
is the importance of schooling - not 
worthwhile trades or any humanly im-
portant attitude or skill. Serving as a 
baby-sitter in which success is measured 
by the amount of time spent in class, by 
years and hours, not by human achieve-
ment, "schools destroy more individuals 
than they liberate." 

Worse yet, school serves to legitimize 
existing social and economic distinctions, 
in which the number of years in school 
rather than birth or station determines 
a modern substitute for class and caste. 
"Schools," he wrote in an article re-
cently published in the New York Review 
of Books, "rationalize the divine origins 
of social stratification with much more 
rigor than churches have ever done." 

Glorifying order and conformity, the 
school system justifies the position of 
the middle class. A far more effective and 
demanding drug than the opium of re-
ligion, the demand for schooling con-
vinces the drop-out, the second-rater and 
the unschooled of a deep-seated sense of 
inferiority for which he is held personaJiy 
responsible. 

But perhaps the most fundamental 
critique which IUich levies against the 
school system is the one which brings his 
thoughts back home to the United States. 
He believes that the age-specific, teacher-
related, graded and obligatory school 
system to which we are subjected is 
ultimately responsible for "the death of 
the imagination and the poisoning of 
the mind." The school vulgarizes learning 
much as the whorehouse vulgarizes love, 
lllich says. One of the great tragedies of 
modem times, lllich maintains, is that the 
basic human need for learning has been 
alienated into the need for being taught -
institutionally taught. As a result, whores 
and teachers have assumed the same social 
function. '-whoring and teaching," he 
says, "must be seen as the professionaliza-
tion of the need for Jove and the need for 
learning." 

With the advent of universal, com-
pulsory schooling, education has become 
devoid of human value and real learning, 
that is, "the awakening awareness of new 
levels of human potential and the use of 
one's creative power to foster human 
life," has been cast aside. Instead, edu-
cation has come to mean promotion from 
one level of a pre-packaged curriculum 
to another. 

In a real sense then, school assumes the 
vital function of socializing the fledgling 
citizen to the pre-packaged, engineered 
products of a modern, technological 
society. In that schools have secured a 
monopoly on modem learning, they have 
consequently gained an exclusive patent 
on the generation of common sense. The 
ritual of compulsory schooling permits 
the "industrial production of common 
sense" and promotes an unquestioning 
acquiescence to an engineered reality. 

The student in school is turned into a 
child. "We need schools," he quips, "to 
degrade our offspring into children." 

And the child is schooled in the three 
fundamental pillars of our society: speed, 
efficiency and competition. 

Cut off from reality by rigid institu-
tional barriers, the student is trained for 
the built-in obsolescence of a technologi-
cal age. He learns to belittle human re-
lationships and discard them. And more 
important, he learns to need the "pack-
age deals" which keep American society 
rolling. Accustomed.to packaged curric-
ulum, he accepts also the packaged satis-
faction of his basic needs. Thirst becomes 
the desire for a Coke. The need for trans-
portation means nothing else than next 
year's model from GM. Health comes to 
mean heart transplants. 

Well introctrinated, the student goes 
from the schoolhouse to take his rightful 
place among the world's best bureaucrats. 
Armed with what lliich calls a "Mega- · 
hygenic world view," the student becomes 
a citizen of the modern world: he is \ eady 
to consume. Convinced that the American 
way can't be beat (no doubt his high 
school was number one in the state), he 
benevolently imposes a straight jacket of 
traffic jams, production lines and class-
rooms on the poor nations of the world. 
and by international agreement calls this 
"development." 

Perhaps it's already too late. Perhaps 
we've already been programmed into 
believing that cars, heart transplants and 
classrooms are necessary to human exis-
tence. So persuasive is the power of the 
institutions we have created that they 
not only shape our preferences. but limit 
our sense of possibilities. Yet if man is 
to survive, his humanity must overcome 
his institutions. This is what lllich is say-
ing. His attack on schooling is a funda-
mental challenge to the accepted pre-
cepts of what he calls our "Machined so-
ciety." In raising his voice against the 
degrading and discriminatory school sys-
