'This is all we know about life,'
said Peter Fonda, sectioning off a
corner of the coffee table with
his finger

This winter Easy Rider opened in Ger-
many, a land whose economic prosperity,
social tensions and moral soul-searching
offers the closest parallels of any West-
ern nation to the current situation in
America. Free-lance writer William Nel-
son, Yale '66, talked with Peter Fonda
during the German dubbing of Easy
Rider in Munich and writes about the
Fonda phenomenon as it looks to an
American abroad.

There was no ivy climbing on the terrace
of Munich's Residence Hotel, and the
brisk weather hadn't carried a trace of
life-giving sunshine all day. No L.A.P.D.
helicopters were spying down from
above, but inside, with Peter Fonda,
was California.

When I entered his suite with Petra
Pauly, a German actress friend of mine,
Fonda rose and smiled a warm greeting.
He was dressed in Levis and a red ban-
dana shirt and barefoot, and his hair was
far longer than it had been on the screen.
Lifting his guitar off a chair so that we
both could sit facing him, he offered us
drinks. I asked for a beer and Petra a
tea, which Peter ordered from room ser-
vice. Happy with a bottle of water,
which is all he ever drinks, Peter set out
a dish of sunflower seeds, some pine
kernel packets, and a bag of dried cur-
rants (which Petra called raisins). I asked
if he were on a health food diet. He said
he wasn't, but his friend Bill Hayward,
who was with us at various times during
the interview, was. Bill said he didn't eat
meat because he didn't like to think of
the animals being killed. It was tough,
though; he said he really liked the taste
of meat.

As I was conducting a brief interview
for Overseas Weekly, a newspaper for
American forces in Europe, the military
was the first subject we took up. I posed
the obvious question that my GI reader
might ask: what would you do if you
were in the Army now?

"I'd go home," he answered dispas-
sionately, as if the matter were so re-
mote to him that he had to press his
imagination to come up with an answer.
"I'd go home, and they'd come and get
me and I'd go home again and again and
again until it just got too expensive for
them to keep bringing me back." Then
his eyes narrowed, and he leaned forward
to put an end to empty conjecture:
"Actually I never would be a GI though.
I'd never fight for any group - religious;
political - not anything like that."

Of course. What kind of an answer had
I been expecting? He saw I was smiling
as I jotted down the quote. "War is in-
sane," he went on. "I would kill to defend
myself, like if somebody was there about
to get me or my kids. But I would feel
weird killing someone and not eating the
body because a man should kill only to
eat."

"When you see somebody you don't
know," he went on, "you always wonder
whether this person wants to hurt you.
So you start to fear him. But what's the
point of that, man? Maybe he wants to
love you - you don't know. But it's the
nature of our governments to say that
he's going to hurt you."

The idea that this man had gained such a
large and attentive audience back home
- at the time Easy Rider was running
number three in nationwide box-office
draw - was somehow very satisfying.
I knew there was more to the peace move-
ment than protests; it strives for a change
not just in policies but in attitudes. If
Peter Fonda, as filmmaker and spokesman
for the movement, can effect some relief
from the fears and frustrations that lie at
the core of Vietnam and race discrimina-
tion, then perhaps there is a resolution in
sight for the schisms dividing America.
As a former part-time hippie I wanted to
bless him. But at the same time, as a
thinking man, I felt unwilling to take him
on faith. I felt the necessity to challenge
his vague abstractions: the peace move-
ment is too important to me to let it be
led by a follower.

The talk turned to Easy Rider, the
motorcycle-and-drug epic that has ele-
vated Peter Fonda from house freak (it
American International (The Wild Angels
and The Trip) to Hollywood's most suc-
cessful black sheep. Co-author and pro-
ducer as well as co-star of Easy Rider,
Fonda had come to Munich to supervise
the German dubbing of the film, which
already was running in France and soon
to open in Italy.

I had seen the English version at a
press showing that morning, and like the
critics whose reviews I had read in Amer-
