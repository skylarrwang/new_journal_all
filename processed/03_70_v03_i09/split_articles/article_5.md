Sure it's warm, honey, but is it art? 
Filling the sculpture garden of the Mu-
seum of Modem Art in New York for a 
two-month period that ended last week 
was a complex network of wires, tubes 
and lights. The electronic apparatus was 
part of a Museum exhibition entitled 
"Spaces" and its tangled wires wound 
their way as far, in one sense, as New 
Haven, for the seven artists who created 
the exhibit are all affiliated with Yale. 
Calling themselves the Yale Research 
Associates in Art - or, informally and 
according to the Modem Museum, 
~ - Patrick Clancy, Michael Cain, 
David Rumsey, William Crosby, William 
Duesing, Peter K.indlrnann and Paul 
Fuge began several years ago to develop 
modes of art aimed at the creation of 
programmed environments. In the MOMA 
garden an intricate system that involved 
blinking lights and infra-red heaters at-
tempted to create new zones of light, 
sound and heat within the existing dimen-
sions of the garden space. Pulsa artists, 
seated within the museum in a glass-
enclosed booth that overlooked the gar-
den, could change and control the 
electronic zones of light, sound and heat 
at wiD. 

The effect of the group's work is to 
heighten a person's awareness of his en-
vironment and his constantly changing 
relationship with that environment. This 
is done specifically with the use of 
various sensory stimulators - lights, 
speakers and infra-red heaters. These out-
puts are activated 6y two processes act-
ing either singly or together. One is via 
a pre-determined program which is fed 
into a signal synthesizer. The other is 
through information gathered directly 
from the environment, i.e., weather, local 
trafrJC, and movement within the environ-
ment. When a person passes by the 
sensors - video monitors and photo-elec-
tric eyes - the mechanism responds ac-
cordingly and defmes the movement in 
stroboscopic outputs of light, sound and 
heat. 

The Pulsa group's rrrst exhibition was 
held at the School of Art and Architec-
ture from April to August of 1968. Al-
though not as mechanically and electron-
ically complex as the system is now, the 
aluminium-foiled modules of the exhibi· 
tion contained speakers, strobes and 
fluorescent lights which were programmed 
to coordinate with musiC. Since this farst 
show, Pulsa has becom~ more popular, 
and the phenomenon has been exhibited 
at the Boston Public Gardens, where 
speakers and strobes were placed under-
water, and at the Yale Golf Course. The 
most recent Pulsa project was the 
"Spaces" exhibition at the Museum of 
Modem Art. 

As with past exhibitions, the MOMA 
show had something for everyone. For 
the psychedelic afiJCionado it was an
elaborate set-up of strobes, bleepers and 
infra-red heaters. The technology buff 
could de)jght in the synthesizing and lag 
effects created by a room full of sophis-
ticated machinery. But now that Pulsa 
has finally found its way into the mu-
seum, the question arises: What is its 
significance to the world of art? 

Though the Pulsa group shuns con-
-. ventional modes of expression and 
works against many established conven-
tions, their final product should be seen 
as within western artistic tradition. 
Rather than portray an environment in 
the illusionistic space of a canvas or in 
physical constructions as in sculpture, 
Pulsa recreates it in the dimension of our 
senses- in Jjght, sound and heat. But 
the exhibition is not meant to be the 
~ltimate light show. The project's cre-
ators see its effects as an addition to the 
environment which activates space in 
order to make the human participant 
more aware of his surroundings. For this 
reason it is signifkant that human pres-
ence affects the behavior of the ma-
chinery. This self-conscious reference 
back to the participant captures the es-
sence of modernism. 

This is done, however, at the expense 
of convention. The final creation is de-
void of physical support: It does not hang 
on a wall, sit on a table or stand on its 
own. It exists in experiential space - in-
deed, it creates one - not the plastic 
world of three dimensions. It requires 
the participant to co-ordinate his 
senses of sight, hearing and touch and in 
so doing gives him a defmition of his 
environment. 

ln many ways the conceptual level is 
as radical as the environment produced. 
Rather than a single signature, an ar-
bitrary name, Pulsa, is attached to the 
completed module. Individualism among 
the creators is suppressed in favor of 
the group identity. This image is more 
than superficial. Within the group, de-
cisions are collectively reached by dis-
cussion, rather than by individual contri-
butions. (The members of Pulsa, with 
their families, even Jjve together com-
mune-style in a farm in the Connecticut 
countryside.) By using this organic 
creation process, no one member is di-
rectly responsible for a particular inven-
tion, giving the creators an anonymity 
unseen in Western art since the Gothic 
period. 

Equally significant is that Pulsa cre-
ations are temporary objects. An environ· 
ment is set up, then dismantled and re-
moved. Contrary to one of the fmest 
traditions of American art, there is no 
exchange of art for capital. No one 
"owns" any of the exhibitions. Pulsa, 
reacting against elitism in art, aims to 
create something for public use, not pri-
vate prestige. Pulsa's next project will 
take this aim even farther. Sponsored by 
the Walker Art Museum in Minneapolis, 
the group will create an environment to 
celebrate the thawing of Minneapolis's 
lakes later this spring. The display will 
be in a public area free of the confines of 
an institution and free, as was not the case 
in New York, of any admission charge. 

Despite the admission charge and the 
somewhat parental, elite presence of 
MOMA, Pulsa functioned well within the 
museum's sculpture garden. But one 
could not avoid a certain irony. The gar-
den of the Museum of Modem Art, 
where generations had come to see 
Rodin, Maillol, Calder, Oldenburg, all 
the very latest in the avant-garde; now, 
with lights and beeps and bursts of 
heat, they aU seemed so ve.ry old. For 
at last, had come in their stead in the 
words of Claes Oldenburg, an art that did 
something other than sit on its ass in a 
museum.~
