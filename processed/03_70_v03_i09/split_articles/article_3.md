ican magazines, I was greatly enthused at 
the idea. Still, except for its great land-
scape footage and the novelty of some 
very realistic pot-smoking scenes, I 
couldn't really get into the ftlm. What 
disturbed me about it was that while os-
tensibly making a plea for love, trust and 
understanding among men, it did so with 
plastic mock-ups. The sheriffs and red-
necks, presented to us as the embodiment 
of intolerance, are as anonymous as the 
hippies, who try to make love work. We 
distinguish between the two groups not 
by what they think and do or say as much 
as by the "role" which they have in the 
"life" of the ftlm. As a dramatic work 
Easy Rider fails; it seems more a propa-
ganda piece dependent upon pre-existing 
sympathies ~nd anxieties - not so much a 
tell-it-like-it-is statement as a tell-it-like-
we-figure-you-think-it-is-too bit. 


With an uneasy awareness that Amer-
ica seems to be dividing into two op-
posing camps, I asked Peter about this 
long-hair versus redneck polarity. He 
explained that Easy Rider is not simply 
about intolerance or injustice towards 
long-hairs. "It's not trying to say, look 
what they do to us," he told us. "It says, 
look what we're doing to ourselves. " 


Freedom, Peter said, at one point, 
is learning something, learning about 
life. He indicated the large glass-slab cof-
fee table before him. "If all of that is 
life," he said, and then sectioned off a 
corner of the table with his finger, "then 
this is as much as we know about it from 
our institutions - schools, churches, po-
lice, college degrees - or whatever your 
credo of the moment happens to be. This 
is what we call 'life.' But it's only a prison. 
All the rest of it - that's life too, and 
that's what we have to learn about.'' 


The talk soon came around to drugs, 
which seem to play as large a role in his 
life as in his film. Petra expressed her 
surprise that they smoked so much in 
Easy Rider; she said she knew they used 
a lot of drugs in California, but she had 
never seen it as depicted in the film. Peter 
shrugged in amusement as he leaned back 
on the couch. "Have you ever tried it?" 
he asked simply. No, she hadn't; she said 
she had wanted to, but she had never got-
ten around to it. Peter quoted the line 
spoken by Wyatt to George as he urges 
George to try a joint: ''That's all right. 
There's nothing to be ashamed of." He 
laughed. 


for a moment I felt a troubled sense 
of self-righteousness. I knew how nice it 
is to get stoned; I also know - too well -
how debilitating it can be if one comes 
to structure his perceptions and sensibil-
ities around its sweetly numbing euphoria 
- restricts his consciousness to the con-
tinual rediscovery of Old Truths. I wanted 
Peter to know I didn't need drugs - I 
even felt an urge to condemn him outright 
for using them as much as he evidently 
does. But gradually the abstinence I had 
imposed on myself since leaving California 
became ever more suspect - moralistical-
ly superficial - as Petra and Peter ex-
changed questioning grins. 


Why not? I had more than enough 
quotes for all the anti-war, Â·pro-love articles 
the Overseas Weekly would run in the 
next ten years. From the cold, clear real-
ity of being "straight" I had a fairly good 
impression of who Peter Fonda was; I had 
gained a basic idea of his conception of 
the film. But the most persuasive argument 
for going ahead and turning on then and 
there was my feeling that Peter Fonda's 
natural state is high. It was a point of 
journalistic integrity. 


I got ripped. But Petra, who doesn't 
smoke at all, had difficulty getting the 
hang of it. Always the perfect host - but 
relaxed, unprepossessing- Peter took 
pains to explain to her the finer points 
of inhaling. He was well stoked himself, 
but entirely in control of himself and the 
situation. 


As we sat back to enjoy the high our 
roles as journalist and celebrity seemed 
to dissipate in the moment's happy ex-
hilaration. We all seemed immensely re-
lieved and set about to reacquaint our-
selves as friends and smoking companions. 


All of a sudden Petra announced, "I'm 
really very pleased how things turned 
out." We had both read Rex Reed's 
lengthy interview with Peter before com-
ing and had expected we would be talk-
ing with a floundering, embittered acid-
head, which is more or less the impres-
sion created by the Reed article. Peter 
smiled as if to say, "See? This is what 
I am." 


We had an occasional laugh as we ex-
changed tales of drug lore, but as for the 
taking of drugs itself, Peter always spoke 
with a somewhat serious manner, friend-
ly but earnest. Drugs seemed to be 
neither a simple thrill for him nor the 
means to greater understanding. At one 
point Petra referred back to the coffee 
table diagram of life 
Peter quickly in-
terjected, "One doesn't learn about life 
through pot." A short time later, after 
a pause in the conversation, I asked if 
he took LSD often. He said he had taken 
about twenty trips, and then added, "I 
never take acid to get high." Laughing, I 
told him I had. 


He didn't deem to appreciate there-
mark, for LSD, as he said at one point, 
had kept him from complete mental 
breakdown. When I mentioned that I had 
been drinking a lot of good Munich beer 
since coming over, he looked at me with 
a smile of compassion. "I used to drink 
a lot myself," he said. Later he remarked, 
:'I don't drink any alcohol because it re-
minds me of bad times." 


A vague sense of paranoia was begin-
ning to creep over me. It was all too per-
fect, too comfortable, and in his pres-
ence I felt somehow unclean. His state-
ments, sr..>ken with an air both flippant 
and founded on conviction, seemed so 
sincere and yet so considered ; his 
positions so spontaneous and still firm, 
fixed - unassailable in the terms he was 
using. The seeming contradictions and 
frightening implications in what he was 
saying didn't seem to trouble him as 
much as the effort expended in articulating 
his thoughts. 


Petra remarked that it must be nice to 
have made so much money (Columbia 
expects Easy Rider, which at the time 
had already grossed $3.5 million, to bring 
in over sixty million) from something 
he believed in. He nodded with a smile, 
"Yeah, it is." When she asked whether he 
is trying to fight the system, he reacted 
with curious surprise. "Fighting the sys-
tem doesn't get you anywhere," he 
told her. "They've got more on their 
side, they'll win. Don't fight the system 
- become it." 


As his face rippled ever so slightly -
looking now like a long-haired William 
Buckley, now like a haggard Vanessa 
Redgrave - it struck me that he might be 
putting me on. On the one hand he had 
pitted himself squarely against the 
American Establishment - at least the 
rednecks, the militarists, the DDT-sprayers 
- but on the other he seemed so en-
tirely a product of it that I wondered 
to what extent he could ever be outside 
of it. Still, I wanted to believe in his 
sincerity, and I searched for something 
that would restore my confidence. 


The talk turned back to his film. Here, 
it seemed, was neutral ground; we could 
all share in the pleasure of rapping about 
that. He told us that he had had the idea 
for a couple of years. It took him some 
time to interest others in the project, but 
Dennis Hopper, who he said had been 
black-listed in Hollywood for eight years, 
thought it was a good idea and started 
working with him on it. 


Peter spoke fondly, proudly about the 
making of the ftlm as if it were a labor 
of love that proved something. Whereas 
several reviewers created the impression 
that it was a hastily conceived, crudely 
made ftlm, listening to Peter talk about 
it showed me how considered every shot 
and sequence were. Hopper worked with 
an unusually high ratio of footage shot 
to footage used; the New Orleans Mardi 
Gras sequence, for one example, ~as 
selected from four hours of footage. 


As origin-ally conceived the film was 
a kind of close-up documentary on two 
modern-day California-style folk heroes, 
and everything was to have been shown 
in great detail. When Petra asked whether 
the bikes - Fonda had designed his own 
- were comfortable to ride, he said he 
got so stiff it hurt, and this too was to 
have been depicted in a sequence where 
they are barely able to dismount. 


The fmished film only hints at Wyatt 
and Billy's background as stuntmen who 
tour the rodeo circuit, but as first con-
ceived, the story opens at their last 
performance. If the film seems trippy as 
it was released, the heads would have 
blown their easy riding minds on this 
earlier version. According to Peter, Cap-
tain America was first to have driven 
through a flaming wooden tunnel on his 
motorcycle. Not simply a dare-devil stunt, 
it calls into play technological awareness: 
the low pressure pocket formed at his back 
collapses the sections of the tunnel behind 
him as he races through. The closing 
feat of the show, announced as Captain 
America's final stunt, is something called 
the "Paper Coffin." Wyatt is wheeled out 
inside a paper coffin lined with twenty 
sticks of dynamite evenly spaced out 
around the framework. The dynamite is 
exploded all at the same time, and Cap-
tain America, lying at the center of the 
radially counter-balanced explosion, 
rises up unharmed. 


"Of course, if three of the sticks don't 
go off," he said with a modest grin, 
" then it's all over, because you're blasted 
out on that side." He said he sold the 
ftlm just on a description of the stunt. 
"It would have been a great number," 
he added. "Steve McQueen has been 
doing his own jumps, and I figured, 
hell, I'd do it myself." 


He had invited us to have dinner with 
him in the suite, and the silence that fol-
lowed the dynamite story was broken 
by the knock of the bellboy bringing the 
meal. We rolled the table in, arranged 
chairs before it and sat down to a very 
fine dinner. We laughed occasionally 
when one of us looked up to see the 
others looking up too; we talked about 
why we had laughed. For the most part, 
though, the meal was silent since we had 
to concentrate on the task of eating. 


Petra and Peter both had veal steaks, 
and I had a mixed grill. I guess. 


Peter didn't like being referred to as 
a Californian, and at one point he 
told Petra rather emphatically that she 
had to distinguish between southern 
and northern California. Although he 
has been living in Beverly Hills for most 
of his adult life, Peter considers himself 
"from New York." Towards the end of 
the dinner I asked him if he felt at home 
in New York. " I've lived there on and 
off since I was fourteen," he said. "I 
was about to flip out there once when 
I was sixteen. When I was there I would go 
out and walk around for hours and then 
come home. But no, man, I don't feel at 
home there. I used to look at everything, 
but there was nothing there, man, nothing 
on the streets. No bread, nothing." 


After dinner he took up his twelve-
string guitar and played for us "The 
Ballad of Easy Rider," the song written 
for the film by Roger McGuinn. A leftÂ· 
hander, he had reversed the strings on 
the guitar; he said he couldn't really read 
music, but he had picked up guitar 
playing sitting around hotel rooms in the 
evening. 


The rest of the music of Easy Rider 
consists of populai songs that Peter told 
us had been selected for theii appro-
pria~ness, not because they were in. l 
asked if he had tried to get Bob Dylan 
to sing his "It's Alright Ma" himself in 
the ftlm's soundtrack (the song is done 
by McGuinn in the ftlm). Peter said that 
Dylan was going to do it at first, but he 
thought it would be too depressing; " It 
wouldn't leave the audience with a feeling 
of hope." Dylan told him he didn't like 
his own voice, didn't think it would con-
tribute to the end of the ftlm. So inÂ· 
stead, he wrote two new verses for it. 


Peter sang the song with the two new 
verses. 


The evening slipped away with Peter 
playing his guitar and singing a number 
of songs by Dylan, Mick Jagger and the 
Beatles. Every so often he would 
apologize for making a mistake;. we as-
sured him it sounded great, and he con-
tinued. He likes playing for people, he 
said at one point; " It's hiding behind my 
act. Usually I have a camera or my acting 
to hide behind, but when I don't have 
them, I pick up my guitar." 


As I listened to him play I was moved 
to think again about him. I doubt he 
could knowingly do harm to anything, 
except perhaps himself. Always pleasant; 
when challenged, always self-effacing 
while bearing out the higher truths of 
love and peace. Always trying to be honest 
and open, but somehow, I thought, not 
really there. He didn't seem aÂ· person a~ 
much'as a composite of the right ideas, 
the embodiment of so many good - even 
Christian - virtues. To say that he has 
hang-ups of his own is only stating the 
obvious, and Fonda himself, would be the 
first to decry his failings: humility, 
another Christian virtue, asked as much 
of him. But the person who can come to 
grips with these hang-ups and try to ef-
fect some sort of resolution, the person 
who can do something about the problems 
confronting America beyond making 
very generalized comments and emotion-
charged assignations of guilt, seemed to 
me, sadly, not to be present. 


At one point he told us about a sound 
technician at Bavaria Studios in Munich 
where easy Rider was being dubbed. 
The man, a friend had told Peter, had 
been a Communist all his life, something 
like seventy years. Peter chuckled when 
he thought about it ; he looked up with 
a grin: "Man, can you imagine being 
anything for seventy years?"
