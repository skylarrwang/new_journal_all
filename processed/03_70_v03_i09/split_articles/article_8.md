**Intervention and Revolution**
**Author: Richard Barnet**
**Page number(s): 14**

The paperback edition of Richard Bar-
net's Intervention and Revolution, which 
has been on prominent display at the 
Yale Co-op recently, is a good inexpensive 
tour de force to place next to the copy 
of the Algiers Motel Incident on your 
radical bookshelf. Barnet covers the rise 
of the "National Security Manager" in 
American society, the interests and fears 
of these managers, and treats in a general 
way most of our interventions armed or 
political, open or clandestine, since the 
early days of the Cold War. His chapters 
on Vietnam can't say much new, but his 
chapters on Greece in 1948 (where we 
won) and other more obscure situations 
are useful. The comprehensive, metic-
ulously footnoted book corroborates 
much of what Nirumand and Copeland 
reveal, but Barnet often finds facts of his 
own. For example, Nirumand tells us 
that the CIA's director of the coup 
which deposed the Iranian nationalist 
Mossadegh in 1953 and restored a more 
"cooperative" Shah to power, was General 
Norman Schwartzkopf, former head of 
the New Jersey State Police. But does he 
remind us that this same Schwartzkopf had 
been a figure in the Lindbergh kidnapping 
case, and erstwhile narrator of the radio 
serial "Gangbusters?" No? Well, 
he was.


**De-Schooling Society**

continued from page 9 
tern, Illich calls into question the entire 
social fabric of modern society. 

Speaking at Yale, Illich urged his 
audience "to resist further school-building 
as some of you resist further war-making." 
He asserted that nations raise armies and 
schools with equal fervor; and that the 
drop-out is just as much a built-in con-
sequence of the school system as the 
dead soldier is a consequence of the mili-
tary. He claimed that the present school 
system "costs too much and damages 
too many children." 

His analysis was economic, but his con-
cern was ultimately humanistic. He chal-
lenged his audience to tear down the 
educational walls and advocated a "mas-
sive redistribution of the social functions 
pre-empted by schools to the other insti-
tutions of society." As an alternative to 
the formal institution which monopolizes 
learning and benefits only the elite, 
Illich proposed a decentralization of the 
learning process in order to insure equal 
access to educational resources for all 
citizens. He outlined a system in which 
each citizen at birth would be issued an 
"edu-card, a passport to learning" which 
would entitle him to utilize an allotment 
of public funds when and where he 
sees fit. 

During the first three years of infancy, 
a child's "edu-card" could be used by his 
mother so that she could learn to teach 
her offspring. Instead of cramming a life-
time of education into a few years of 
schooling, attendance at a learning center 
could be made obligatory for one or 
two months a year for all citizens be-
tween the ages of five and thirty. The rest 
of the year could be productively spent 
working, travelling, reading and ex-
periencing. With his card, the citizen 
could purchase access to parks, theaters, 
museums, libraries, trips, etc. He could 
also purchase the time of coaches, tutors, 
psychologists, or gurus. 

Illich's proposal is based on the con-
viction that most learning can take place 
without the guidance of a professional. 
He asserts that an educational system 
should embody three fundamental ob-
jectives: equal opportunity for personal 
freedom, universal preparation for social 
and political participation, and man-
power development for social and eco-
nomic institutions. These goals are in-
compatible with the institutionalized 
monopoly on education presently enjoyed 
by the school system. He feels that a 
citizenry motivated and conscious of the 
fact that education is a scarce resource 
will utilize their educational opportunities 
far more efficiently than under the 
present system. 

He also hopes that by decentralizing 
the learning process that "educational 
fraud could at least be reduced to the 
level of political fraud." He advocates the 
enactment of legislation in order to pro-
tect the citizen in his educational con-
sumption. There might be an extension of 
the first amendment to include non-dis-
crimination on the basis of years of school-
ing, and the establishment of anti-trust 
laws to prevent educational monopoly. 

Illich foresees the establishment of learn-
ing centers catering to specific skills and 
envisions the breakdown of the tradi-
tional barriers between work and educa-
tion through new forms of on-the-job 
training. 

Illich recognizes that the "de-schooling 
of society" will result in inequities. But 
he feels that the benefits far outweigh 
the disadvantages. No system, he main-
tains, can be as unjust and inequitable 
as the one we all take for granted. 

The chief significance of Illich's mes-
sage is a warning that we cannot afford 
to take our institutions for granted. 
"Twenty years ago," he remarked, "we 
did not by necessity believe that a 
military officer was a mad man. Today, 
we still don't believe this of university 
presidents." Yet schools, undeniably, can 
be just as lethal as bullets; perhaps even 
worse, for they destroy the mind. The 
commuter, caught in a traffic jam, be-
comes utterly convinced that the only 
solution is more expressways. Never does 
he stop to think that he would be better 
off without a car at all. Illich pointed 
out ironically to his audience that "ed-
ucated" men apply the same logic to 
schooling. 


**Yale Admissions**
**Author: Margaret Coon, George Kannar**

continued from page 2 
Furthermore, the plan to reduce 
the size of each Yale class (either 
permanently or until new colleges 
are built) better fulfills Yale's ob-
ligation to educate women as well as 
men. The Yale girls are not here as 
accessories to the Yale men; they are 
here on their own. They ought to be 
treated as full-fledged members of the 
community - and that means no discrim-
ination in admissions. 

There are other possibilities 
too. For example it would be possible 
to increase the university's enroll-
ment by twenty-five percent and run 
the university on a quarter system, 
so that the facilities would never be 
too crowded. They would just be used 
all year around. 

In the end, though, the situa-
tion for next year depends on what 
transpires at the Corporation meet-
ing of March 7th. Either a few more 
girls and much overcrowding or else 
considerably fewer men and many more 
women will result. It's in the self-
interest of everyone at Yale that the 
Corporation choose the second idea 
over the first. But, as you know, 
Mr. Brewster says they won't "unless 
it is absolutely necessary."


**Frank Talk on TV News**
**Author: Peter Kyros**

Frank talk on TV news
Reuven Frank is not your ordinary news-
man; he talks and dresses with the under-
stated detachment of a banker. It's be-
cause he's President of NBC news. For 
nine years before that he produced the 
Huntley-Brinkley Report. His view of 
television is clearly the product of his 
experience with the pressures of creat-
ing a daily news program. He seems to 
have come to terms with these pressures 
through a cool professionalism. He talks 
softly and smokes Larks, lots of them. 

Recently Mr. Frank was at Yale as a 
Poynter Fellow in Journalism. He showed 
films and talked about TV news to 
about two hundred persons in the Pierson 
dining hall. Mr. Frank was asked to bring 
the films of the Chicago Democratic Con-
vention. He couldn't, he said, because it 
was all live, and there are no archives of 
news programming. The networks keep 
everything they broadcast for a week, 
then erase it and tape again. Transcripts 
are made but they "just pile up." "Be-
sides," said Mr. Frank, "you can never 
really see it again in context. Television 
is momentary and instantaneous, and 
newspapers are for the record." 

This exchange is interrupted by the 
quick appearance of numbers, from eight 
on down, flashing on a movie screen. 
Suddenly Huntley and Brinkley become 
full-size people in color (movie color). 
The film, one of NBC's broadcasts from 
January of 1968, contains the first live 
pictures of the Tet offensive. American 
soldiers rid the American Embassy of VC, 
and Jack Perkins, the NBC reporter, com-
ments that "we were taken by surprise." 
Titters and applause come from the 
audience. 

The Vietnam film is unedited, broad-
cast from Tokyo through New York 
without being seen by Huntley, Brinkley 
or anybody. The reporters assure us that 
American bases are secure, and no cities 
could be taken. But the irony is lost in a 
rush of irate questions about the reporters' 
presumptions in giving those smug assur-
ances. The audience grumbles. Some ask 
whether NBC would consider doing a 
true documentary of the war in Vietnam. 
Mr. Frank's answer is another film. 

On screen: Frank McGee, March 10, 
.1968 - The New Year, The New War. 
It is a brutal documentary of the Tet 
offensive, starting with a peacock in liv-
ing color and the strangeness of TV on 
the Big Screen. 

First, film clips of President Johnson 
and Robert McNamara, each of them 
saying on successive dates from 1966 
through early 1968: "We are doing well." 
"We will not have to expand the conflict." 
A quick shot of Westmoreland on March 10, 
the day he asked for 206,000 more 
men saying: "We have taken the offensive 
from the enemy." There are the knowing 
cheers in the dining hall. 

Then, the war. Again, films of the 
American Embassy attack. This time 
clearer, well-edited, but the same con-
fusion is there, in the situation, not the 
editing, Saigon is burning; Hue is burn-
ing, and Frank McGee is droning on. All 
of the suspected VC sympathizers are 
"rounded up." 

A man is standing on the screen in 
profile - Vietnamese in a red plaid shirt. 
A police chief walks up and shoots him 
neatly in the temple; he crumples, some-
one attaches a piece of red cloth with a 
number to his belt. John Hersey, in the 
far corner of the room, stirs uneasily; he 
did not come for this. 

The reel ends, many people begin to 
leave, quietly - among them myself. 
There are few hands, few questions. 
Colors in the dining hall are drab, brown 
tables in disarray - Kodacolor is bright 
and real. Mr. Frank comes forward from 
the corner behind the screen, easily, 
lighting a cigarette. He is unperturbed, 
he is a producer: it was a good film then, 
it still is. Mr. Frank is watching us. 
"Journalism is a craft," he had said, 
"like good carpentry."


a very heavy amplifier indeed 
It has taken us at David Dean Smith a 
long time to find a medium priced 
amplifier that we could enthusiastically 
recommend and guarantee for two years-
parts and labor. 

Most amplifiers we tried had the following problems: 
they could never come near meeting their 
published specifications; they tended to have 
a transistory tinny sound; and occasionally 
they blew up. 

But we found the Pioneer 900, and all became 
well with the world. It easily produces sixty watts RMS 
a channel with both channels driven. (This is 
the same as 200 IHF watts.) But most important, 
it sounds incredibly fine. 

It costs two hundred and sixty dollars. Bring up 
some of your favorite Mayall, Clapton or Bach 
sides and listen to the Pioneer 900. 
Or listen to our copy of the Pentangle.

The Environmental 
Crisis: Man's Struggle to Live with Himself 
edited by Harold W. Helfrich, Jr. 
Ecological catastrophe threatens the very 
base of our sociopolitical structure. The 
combined scourges of water and air pollu-
tion, mismanaged national resources and 
open spaces, increasing and unplanned 
populations, urban congestion, and mis-
management of our national energies are 
creating human despair in the midst of un-
precedented technological advances. The 
papers in this book, representing a lecture 
series presented during 1968-69 at the 
School of Forestry at Yale University, deal 
with our survival in the face of the rapid 
deterioration of our natural surroundings. 
The contributors are among the most 
distinguished authorities in the fields of 
science, law, regional planning, economics, 
and government. Their commentaries arise 
from practical experience gained during 
outstanding careers and each provides a 
close examination of one of the ecological 
or ethical problems plaguing mankind, 
which, in their ultimate significance, over-
shadow wars, ideologies, and races.
