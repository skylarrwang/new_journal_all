and mankind,' sitting for hours in a 
room in the White House pondering 'our 
heritage and our ideals' and having re-
actions of 'shocked surprise' to the in-
stance of Soviet disingenuousness which 
had just been shown them. I believe that 
most intelligent citizens would be re-
lieved, not dismayed, to hear something 
nearer the truth: that there was not a man 
.,. 
in that room who was capable of 'shocked 
â€¢ 
surprise' at anything ... 

He then gives his own view. 
The top decision-makers of our govern-
ment have no intention of letting our 
future be determined by 'chicken' 
proficients [unpredictable, likely un-
friendly leaders] in Africa or Asia or any-
where else. There are limitations on what 
the government of a democratic country 
can do about its internal handicaps; 
there are none on what we can do in the 
country of others. Or, rather, when our 
Government decides what to do about 
other countries it is limited only by con-
siderations of effectiveness .... If we do 
not lie about our intentions or enter 
into treaties we don't intend to honour 
it is because such behavior is ineffective 
- and the fact remains. of course. that 
we do lie about our intentions and fail 
to abide by our treaties when it is in 
our advantage to do so and when we 
can get away with it .... Naturally, I am 
not defending such duplicity: I have no 
~ feeling about it o ne way or another. I 
only contend that it exists. 

Considering his sharp edge, I have a 
tendency to disbelieve that Miles Copeland 
has no feelings about that duplicity. Per-
haps the evolution of Copeland's personal 
ethical outlook towards crypto-diplo-
macy, his transition from insider to out-
sider, would make another kind of revela-
tion for future historians. 

The Game of Nations is more than just 
a competent account, however. First, 
it is beautifully, tightly written, full of 
dramatic episodes and unexpectedly 
twisted literary references - "The Game 
without Nasser is like Hamlet without 
Polonius." Second, it is really a serious 
study of Carnal Abdel Nasser as a type of 
Third World leader, also typified by 
Nkrumah of Ghana and Sukarno of In-
donesia, who is forced to keep power 
through repression of his countrymen 
and through demogogic exhortations and 
exploitation of chauvinistic nationalism 
and fanaticism. These leaders are forced 
into this position, Copeland points out, 
because realistic economic prospects for 
their nations are so totally hopeless that 
a constructively liberal course is impos-
sible politically. If they promise their 
people anything tangible, however small, 
they will not be able to fulfill their 
promises. Impoverished Egypt, with its 
skyrocketing birthrate, is perhaps the 
earth's most classically tragic example of 
this condition. 

In an implicit answer to theoreticians 
like Walt Rostow, Copeland advances 
his own multi-stage model for this political 
economic "progress" of revolutions in 
poor nations. There are three stages. In 
stage one, the revolution begins to trans-
form the traditional socio-political struc-
ture. Landlords are exiled and their fief-
doms broken up. The leadership begins 
to mobilize the people. In stage three, the 
revolution shows measurable positive in-
fluence upon the quality of everyday life 
in the country, and offers the people a 
modest new deal firmly based upon 
technocratic progress and graceful, unique 
incorporation of some traditional values.
But stage three can never be reached. 
Because to promise what cannot be de-
livered would alienate the masses and 
eventually undermine the Nasser-type 
leader, the leader exhorts the nation into 
regressive stage two and an indefinite 
limbo of political "displacement activity" 
of totalist propaganda, national cam-
paigns after pie-in-the-sky abstract goals 
and military crusades. At least, figures 
the harried (and at heart patriotic) despot, 
this constantly mobilized, constantly 
taut stage two is better than the old sleep 
of stage one. Many of his followers will 
agree with him, and Copeland shows 
sympathetically that there is a sort of 
logic behind their agreement. 

There were years when Miles Copeland, 
the insider, had lunched with Nasser once 
a week; he may know Nasser better than 
any other American. His book's most time-
ly gift to outsiders who normally depend 
on The New York Times for their image 
of Nasser and the Third World, is a clear 
isolation and explication of this sort of 
logic, the logic of frustration, the logic 
which, once grasped, can make "ir-
responsible, irrational" deeds of people like 
Arabs more fathomable. Even with all 
the tools of "crypto-diplomacy" Americans 
don't appreciate have-not systems 
of logic very much. As Copeland says 
himself, the failure to understand this 
logic can render even the powers of the 
CIA irrelevant. 

The best known methods of intelligence 
analysis- the [political simulation] 
Game, the CIA, the State Department, or 
whatever - have not proved up to pre-
dicting the actions of leaders of those 
countries of Africa, Asia and South Amer-
ica where the economic situation ap-
pears hopeless, where the gap between 
expectations and realization apparently 
can't be closed, where the people are 
frustrated, and where the leaders, if they 
are to stay in power, must either resort 
to demagoguery or discover new ways of 
squeezing more aid from the rich coun-
tries or both. 


**New Imperialism**
**Author: Bahman Nirumand**

Bahman Nirumand was an Iranian 
leftist student in Germany when he wrote 
his New Imperialism in 1967. His book 
is partly credited with stirring violent 
leftist student riots against the Shah during 
his German visit of 1967. It has recently 
been translated into English, and it is 
excellent. It documents, for example, how 
Western powers exploit Iranian oil, and 
how American development plans for 
Iran do not fit the needs of her people. 
The book, however, has to be seen - no 
matter how solid it is - as a foil to Cope-
land's classic. When Nirumand (an out-
sider) tries to document the CIA's role 
in the fall of the nationalist Mossadegh he 
is forced to quote old articles in the 
Saturday Evening Post. He cannot tell 
you what the engineers of the coup said 
in the car on the way out of the palace.
