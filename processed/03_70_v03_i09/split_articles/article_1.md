More women, yes?

When you stop and think about it, Yale's widely
heralded entry into women's education does not really
amount to very much. And even if you don't think that's
true, you can be pretty sure Kingman Brewster does.

In his address to the Yale alumni just a couple of
weeks ago, Brewster gave the clear impression that
he thinks of women undergraduates as accessory to
the real business of the college: turning out "one
thousand male leaders" each year.

"We can't give them women as a new gesture
every year," said the King, and the alumni chuckled.
And all betrayed their lack of comprehension of
what it's all about.

Not that this misunderstanding is new: it has
been present all the way through the long effort
to bring women to Yale. The attitude was most typ-
ically expressed in Henry Chauncey's statement on
a WAVZ radio special "The Year at Yale", when
he said that Yale was accepting women because a
Yale education was something which ought to be of-
fered to womankind. A combination of a concern for
attracting better men to Yale (for the best were
going elsewhere, where there were girls) and of a
desire to pacify the men who were already here
brought the first wave of five-hundred-odd women
to Yale. The "gesture", in the president's own
words, was made.

Unfortunately a realistic commitment to the
direction of a coed Yale was not also made at that
time. The same facilities were to be used for an
additional five hundred bodies. Everyone just had
to squeeze over, and for a while no one really com-
plained. They just figured, what the hell, having
girls here is worth the discomfort of sharing your
triple with a fourth guy. Also, of course, the
same faculty had to teach the greater number of stu-
dents, but that was alright too because the faculty
also liked the idea of having a few coeds around.

However, now that the girls have been here a
year things look a little different. That room which
was once a triple may soon be a quint. That seminar
which once had only ten people will have another
two or three people signing up every fall who wouldn't
have signed up before. Students, some of them any-
way, are becoming disgruntled with the results of
the president's gesture; girls are fine, but crowd-
ing is not.

But did we say "students"? Sorry. We must
be wary, for "students" and "men" must no long-
er be confused. As a rather startled Alumni Day gath-
ering discovered, the student body now includes a
healthy contingent of females, who also are not par-
ticularly content with their lot. So in addition to
the normal masculine agitation, a few feminine ruf-
fles and flourishes have been added to the annual
spring rites. At the Alumni Day luncheon the issue
was joined.

Overcrowding has been the main source of sup-
port for the idea that the number of men in each
class should be reduced. But overcrowding does not
just mean longer dining hall lines and less spacious
rooming arrangements; it means stretching the uni-
versity's already thin resources still thinner.

The matter of financial aid is the one which
makes or breaks the admissions policies. If there
is plenty of aid, any qualified applicant can come.
If there is not, then it becomes a case of first
paid, first served. In a recent speech, the soon de-
parting Dean of Admissions, R. Inslee Clark, warned
that the university may be nearing the end of the
line as far as the "open door" aid policy goes.

If the end, God forbid, is ever reached it's back to
Dink Stover days once again. And steadily increas-
ing the enrollment is not a good way of keeping that
financial door open.

It ought to be remembered as well that the uni-
versity backed into full coeducation in the first
place. Full integration of women into Yale's daily
life was not the original aim. Before coeducation
there was talk of transplanting a well-known women's
college to New Haven and assorted whispers about su-
perwealthy alumni who were going to set up a coor-
dinate college. We even heard, for a little while,
about something called "cluster" colleges, but
they disappeared even before they were explained.

When Coed Week happened Brewster plunged ahead
with an admirable damn-the-torpedoes attitude
which got girls here in a hurry, but which left
the future wide open.

Technically speaking, the future still is
wide open. Open admissions is not only desirable: it
is possible as well. Dean Clark has repeatedly
said he could find a goodly number of coeds to take
up the slack if the number of males in next year's
freshman class is cut. The Yale Daily News has
even quoted him as saying an open admissions policy
would produce a class composed of forty percent fe-
males. Although Clark says he could switch to an open
admissions policy as late as the third week in March,
he believes it will be "very difficult, not impos-
sible, but very difficult" after that. The ides of
March, then, is a real cut-off point. And the Yale
Corporation meeting on the first Saturday in March
may well be the deciding time.

If current plans are not changed, the back-
wards move into coeducation will have more and more
side effects as each annual step in Brewster's proj-
ect of incremental coeducation is implemented. Al-
though the president has asked the alumni for money
to build new colleges, they have not responded quick-
ly enough; there are, unfortunately, no concrete plans
laid out for the building of new residential colleges.
Instead the university is spending time and attention
on building a Social Science Center which probably
will be located on the choicest of all possible res-
idential spots: the block across from the Cross
Campus, the block now occupied by the Elizabethan
Club, Hendrie Hall, DUH and several other university-
owned buildings. If plans for the Social Science
Center continue as they are now envisioned, then
even when the residential colleges are finally built
they will be far away from the center of the campus
and far away from the rest of the students.

There is no particular reason why the Social
Science Center could not be built somewhere else - up
near the admissions office, for example, in the spot
now occupied by the geography department building
and the political science research library. It would be far
more sensible to have the Center up there than on prime
residential territory.

The plans as they now stand will put a squeeze on
housing in New Haven by encouraging students to move
off-campus in dissatisfied droves. Housing is already short
for graduate students and townspeople. In addition,
current plans would destroy the residential college system
by moving upperclassmen into temporary quarters out-
side the colleges and by scattering freshmen all over the
place.

Reducing the number of men in each class and increas-
ing the university's residential capacity are sequential
rather than either/or propositions. First one and then the
other. The real problem with organizing support for the
idea of cutting back on male admissions is that the plan
is so eminently reasonable: it simply makes more sense
in all terms - financial, moral, educational and
sociological - than the plan which the university has thus
far followed. It has its problems, of course, as every plan
does. For one thing it does not deal with alumni opinions
on any but a rational level, and we have all learned long
ago that alumni prejudices, rather than opinions, are
what really count. But if the alumni really expect Brew-
ster to fulfill his commitment to them to produce
"one thousand male leaders" each year, then the burden
is upon them to provide sufficient funds.
