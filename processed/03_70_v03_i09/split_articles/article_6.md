If you are worried about the CIA, you 
are also worried about Y11le, because so 
many Old Blues you hear of from time to 
time have prominently or quietly played 
the role of national security managers 
during the Cold War. If you are a ferreting 
idealist-to-radical, a would-be writer of 
exposes, you are tantalized by your 
certain knowledge that so many CIA men 
- plus many other men who have so in-
evitably used the CIA in building and 
protecting their careers - come and go 
in your local dining halls, lounges and 
tombs. You may be more tantalized (and 
quickly disquieted) by your first glimpses 
of what types of men these are, glimpses 
which suggest to your introspective mind 
that these men at least began their ca-
reers with moral sensibilities which re-
semble your own in 1970. At first, re-
minds Miles Copeland in The Game of 
Nations, CIA types were seen by the 
military establishment in somewhat the 
same light as that establishment sees you 
today, as "wild-eyed intellectuals whose 
colleges don't want them back." 

If you want to expose bankruptcy 
in our government, Miles Copeland has 
already done a good deal of your work 
for you. He reveals several varieties. To 
give only three examples: 
1. He states that the CIA helped arrange 
the overthrow of the only republican 
government Syria had after her indepen-
dence from French mandate, in favor of 
a little tin demagogue named Husni 
al-Zaim, in 1949. 
2. He reveals that American generals re-
cruited Nazis for service in the intelligence 
services of Third World nations friendly 
to us, when World War II was scarcely over. 
3. He reveals that, because of interdepart-
mental jealousies, failures of one agent 
to let another know he was in town, and 
the like, supposedly calculated American . 
diplomatic dealings with Nasser's Egypt 
have more closely resembled hide-and-seek 
scenes in Marx Brothers movies. 

The book is an insider's history of Ameri-
can crypto-diplomacy in the Middle East 
from early Cold War years to June, 1967. 
It concentrates on Nasser's Egypt. One 
of the main reasons The Game of Na-
tions is such an effective expose is 
that you needn't have any qualms about 
the goals of United States policy to be 
shocked by it. 

Miles Copeland was an insider. He was 
present when the CIA was created in 1949 
after having been Vice Counsel at our 
embassy in Syria. In 1955 he switched 
to the State Department to become head 
of its Middle East Policy Planning Com-
mittee, where he worked until he quit in 
1957 to work for a private consulting 
firm in the Mid-east. Copeland continued 
to do trouble-shooting and consulting 
work for our government, and perhaps 
others. And perhaps he still does. Accord-
ing to his dustcover notes, he is now a 
senior partner in a consulting firm. He 
lives in London, and perhaps for that 
reason (although if one believes con-
spiracy theories it is easy to imagine other 
reasons) his book appeared in England 
last fall while it is still awaited here in 
the country - where it should cause the 
most excitement. 

The finest exposes can only be written 
by such insiders, the few privileged peo-
ple who were so deeply involved in 
events that they can weave a convincing, 
complete fabric out of every thread of 
nuance and detail from the situations 
they were in. The major trouble with in-
siders' exposes is that questions must 
inevitably be raised about the motives 
of the authors, who presumably have un-
dergone striking shifts of allegiance as 
their roles changed from those of priv-
ileged participants to muckraking his-
torians. 

When Joe McGinnis wrote The Selling 
of the President 1968, he made it clear 
that he had only been a pseudo-insider on 
the Nixon PR team, a journalist in huck-
ster's clothing. Knowing this, we accept 
his revelations easily not just because we 
dislike Nixon, but also because we under-
stand that as a sharp guy on the make 
he was working for himself through it all. 
He had no one's secrets to protect and 
had not been paid to be more fair to one 
interest than another. 

Miles Copeland's work is of a greater 
magnitude than The Selling of the Presi-
dent 1968, because McGinniss simply 
brought to life what anyone who watched 
television could have figured out was go-
ing on, somewhere. The Game of Nations, 
however, describes phenomena normal-
ly beyond our ken. But of Copeland we 
are also forced to ask that question, "Why 
did he, an ex-insider who for aU we know 
may stm be a professional insider in 
some counsels, write this expose?" -
a book which so clearly shows American 
diplomatic crusaders as Machiavellis, or 
worse, bumblers whom Machiavelli 
would have been the first to sack had 
he been in charge. The question is not 
wholly answerable from the book alone, 
but Copeland provides a partial explana-
tion in the beginning of his book. 

He claims his purpose is forthrightly 
to acquaint the public "and future his-
torians" with a little known and impor-
tant component of American diplo-
macy. He says he has revealed nothing 
which would violate either United States 
or British government security regula-
tions - unless, he adds, it has already 
been brought to light by previous es-
pionage leaks or journalists' coups. And 
he affirms " I have not...withheld any-
thing because of loyalty to the cabal." 

Fundamentally, Copeland seems testily 
determined not to allow pseudo-idealists 
to remain idealists in the public's eyes. 
He's out to destroy the 
View of our nation's statesmanship 
which they get, for example, from Robert
