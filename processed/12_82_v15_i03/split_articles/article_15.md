The 
Blasting off 
The Blues Astronauts are alive and 
well and living in Brighton. Mter 
some personnel reshuffiing, the 
rhythm and blues/funk band that 
formed at Yale two years ago has 
pulled its act together and taken it on 
the road. 

The Astronauts were no less than a 
tradition during their years at Yale, 
headlining local clubs and elevating 
stale SAC parties to something of an 
event. When the group of six self-
taught musicians graduated last May, 
they were having such a good time 
that they decided to make a career of 
it. 

So instead of dissolving like so 
many college bands do, the Blues 
Astronauts simply went to Boston, 
rented a big house, bought a New-
foundland puppy named Dagoo, and 
began working up and down the 
Eastern Seaboard from Maine to 
New York. They've played every gig 
they could get their hands on -from 
the Walpole Maximum Security 
Prison in Massachusetts to frat par-
ties on the university circuit to the 
biggest dance clubs in Boston and 
Providence. 

The original band at Yale was 
composed of Jodie Myers in Silliman 
and five students from Jonathan Ed-
wards: Michael Albrecht, Paul 
Bloodgood, Boo Elmer, Willie Mac-
Mullen and Dan Perlman. After 
graduation, however, Elmer and 
MacMullen dropped out of the 
group, and the Astronauts added a 
new harmonica player, Andy 
Breslau. 

Last March, the original members 
cut a promotional album, No Sanc-
tuary, at Real Art Ways studio in 
Hartford. The new Astronauts plan 
t? record another album soon, this 
ttme in a New York studio with the 
backing of some new investors. "We 
were pretty unprofessional on the 
Production side last time," said Mike 
Smith, TD '82 the band's manager. 
"This next one' should be better." 
So far the Astronauts have met 
with enthusiasm and critical acclaim, 
including a favorable review in the 
Boston Phoenix this fall. But they are 
finding out that breaking into the 
club circuit is not easy. "We are not 
an established name," said Smith. 
"We haven't opened up for any big 
names yet, but we're getting there." 
Last May they appeared in a blues 
festival which featured such artists as 
J .B. Hutto and the New Hoods, and 
Koko Taylor. 

While pleased with the progress, 
the Astronauts have discovered that 
professional music isn't the most 
lucrative business in the world- at 
least at first. "Clubs don't pay well," 
Smith explained. "The money's tight. 
We all have part-time jobs, from 
record producer to video computer 
salesman to our painting division. 
We're using our brains as much as 
possible." 

The Astronauts soon hope to hit 
some of the top New York clubs 
(Smith calls them "the toughies")-
nightspots like the Mudd Club and 
CBGB's. "We're going to do this until 
it becomes obvious that it's not going 
to work," said Smith. "It's working 
now. We've gone this far-I guess 
we'll be all right."

Jennifer Beals: for God, for country 
and for Hollywood. 

The reel wor1d 

She had been at Yale scarcely a week,~ 
yet Jennifer Beals, Calhoun '86, was 

packing her bags. While her 
classmates were settling into their 
first Yale weekend, the 18-year-old 
actress from Chicago was in New 
York signing a contract for the lead 
role in Paramount Pictures' new ven-
ture, Flo.shdance- now filming, and 
scheduled for release in April. 

For Beals, who hopes to return to 
Yale by next semester , making a 
movie is more of a diversion than 
anything else. "At this time it's not a 
career to me," she said, "because I 
know I'm not dedicated to acting for 
the rest of my life." Still, a motion 
picture contract is not exactly 
something she can walk away from. 
She remembers the day one of the 
film producers leaned across his office 
desk with a "Satanic look" in his eyes 
t and reminded her, "We own you 
z now." There was a moment, recalled 
J! Beals, when she felt like Faust coo-
l tracting with the devil. 

In Flo.shdance, Beals plays the part 
.!i of a 19-year-olq welder in Pittsburgh 
who aspires to be a professional 
dancer. The director of the picture is 
Adrian Lyne, who, incidemally, 
worked with another Yale actress, 
Jodie Foster, in the recent film Foxes. 

Although Beals has done little ac-
ting, she has already made a name 
for herself in a slightly different line 
of work. She is covering her Yale ex-
penses with the money she earned 
during her hectic modeling career in 
high school, which included posing 
for fashion magazines and catalogues, 
showing for Chicago designer Perry 
Ellis, and working last summer in 
Paris. "While other kids were doing 
homework," remembered Beals, "I 
was putting on makeup and running 
out to do a job." Her only previous 
film experience was a small part as a 
high school student in My Bodyguard. 
Beals said she already misses her 
newly-made friends and the academic 
atmosphere at Yale. "There are times 
when I wonder what the heck I'm do-
ing out here. You're supposed to be 
in school at this point in your life. 
But I get the best of everything. I can 
experience this and then go back to 
school. Still, it would be nice if we 
were filming in New Haven."
