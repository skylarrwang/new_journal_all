Brewster's new calling 
Kingman Brewster has always 
had a knack for settling dis-
putes. As President of Yale 
in the turbulent '60s and 
Ambassador to Great Britain 
during a period of social tur-
moil, Brewster had ample op-
portunity to hone his skills as 
a mediator. 

Since we last looked in on 
Brewster (TN], January 30, 1982), 
his talent has led him in unexpected 
directions: Brewster is now settling 
multi-million dollar contract disputes 
between big-name basketball 
players-like Moses Malone and Ber-
nard King-and the National Basket-
ball Association (NBA). 
"It's a whole new world to me," 
Brewster explained. "I'm no expert in 
basketball or sports, but I'm learning 
a lot about them, and that's what 
keeps you young." 
Last May, Brewster became 
"Special Master" to rule on points of 
law in disputes between the Basket-
ball Players League and the NBA. 
He passes preliminary judgements on 
what the law says to help the district 
courts handle their swelling case load. 
"It's not like being czar of the NBA," 
Brewster said. "It's simply acting on 
behalf of the court in their legal 
disputes." 
Yale Presidents have dabbled in the 
world of professional sports on other 
occasions. Before A. Bartlett Giamat-
ti succeeded Brewster as President of 
Yale, he wrote several sports articles 
for Harper's magazine. His article, 
"Tom Seaver's Farewell," won an 
award for best sports story of the 
year. 
But Brewster finds his new job 
strange. "I wouldn't have dreamed of 
doing this anymore than I would 
have dreamed of being President of 
Yale or Ambassador to the Court 
of St. James," he said. 
Brewster caused a stir this sum-
mer when he wrote a Boston Globe 
editorial calling for "universal public-
ly useful service." Many people 
10 The New Journal/December 1, 1982 
thought Brewster was advocating a 
return to the draft, although he in-
sists his proposal was for something 
different. "It would have to be truly 
universal, and it wouldn't have to 
military," he said. "My motto is I 
would rather be drafted than nuked 
but since I'm too old to be drafted, 
that doesn't hold up so well, because ._., ... ,L~L.J' 
you're never too old to be nuked." 
Brewster doesn't have to spend 
much time on his NBA work. He has 
handled only four cases since his ap-
pointment as Special Master. He 
spends the rest of his time revising a 
book, tentatively titled TM Persistent 
Agenda, in which he will develop his 
ideas for universal service in several 
chapters. He hopes to present the 
book to a publisher sometime this 
spring.
