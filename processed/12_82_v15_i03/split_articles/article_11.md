Should Yale have a white-collar union? 
Two thousand six hundred clerical and 
technical employees may have to decide soon. 
Local 34, the union trying to organize the 
workers, claims that it will petition the Na-
tional Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to 
hold an election soon. 
Organizers 
say they already have the signatures of the 30 
percent of the workers required by the NLRB 
to petition for an election, but they are 
waiting for a "substantial majority" of the 
workers to sign before filing a petition. 
If the clerical and technical employees form 
a union, it could wield enormous power 
because of the central position these workers 
occupy in the University. A white-collar 
union could make substantial changes in 
working conditions and significantly alter the 
status quo at Yale. 

Various groups have tried to organize the 
white-collar workers over the past 15 years 
("In search of a white collar union," TNJ, 
October 24, 1981). They have waged 
vigorous campaigns since the early 1960's, 
although the workers have voted on two occa-
sions against forming a union. 

Since November 1980, Local 35, Federa-
tion of University employees, AFL-CIO, 
Yale's dining hall and maintenance workers 
union, has assisted the clerical and technical 
workers in trying to organize a "sister union" 
to be known as Local 34, while the Universi-
ty has waged its own campaign to discourage 
the workers from forming a union. 

The New Journal asked the rep-
resentatives of the University and the Union 
to outline their positions on this issue for the 
Yale community. Radley Daly '49, Director 
of Administrative Services for Yale, summed 
up the University's argument, and John 
Wilhelm, '67, coordinator of the organizing 
campaign for Local 34, gave the union's 
perspective. 

University: 
"Voluntary 
cooperation and 
mutual respect" 
Radley Daly
It is the deeply held conviction of Yale's 
administration that we must strive to 
manage this institution in such a way 
that our clerical and technical 
employees will enjoy and be challenged 
by their jobs and will feel fairly treated 
and justly compensated. We believe 
that the majority of the Yale staff 
shares our concern that Yale will 
become not a better place, but a worse 
place to work if a third party is paid to 
come on the campus and bring about 
the 
adversarial atmosphere that 
unionization inevitably creates. 

Who are the clerical and technical 
staff members? They are the more 
than 2,500 women and men whose jobs 
are in offices and laboratories, in 
libraries and galleries, and in service 
units such as the Health Center and 
the Telephone Switchboard Room. 
They perform secretarial and book-
keeping tasks; they carry out research 
experiments; they help to buy books 
and to return them to library shelves; 
they print Yale's stationery; they 
schedule classes; they run computers. 
Yale could not carry on without them. 

Those who are employed full time 
(most are) typically work 37 1/2 hours 
per week. Their salaries range from 
$8,275 to well over $20,000. One in 
three has worked on the campus for 
more than five years. They have 
always been especially supportive of 
students and faculty, and during those 
occasional times when Yale has had 
tough sledding, they have pitched in 
with the extra effort needed to keep the 
place going. 

Not only is there variety in their 
jobs, but there is variety in the pur-
poses for which clerical and technical 
staffs serve Yale and in the size of the 
departments in which they work. One 
has only to look at the centerfold of 
any issue of the Weekly Bulletin & Calendar to appreciate the wide range of ac-
tivities at Yale. On any given day 
literally hundreds of different things 
are going on in hundreds of University 
buildings. Some of the larger depart-
