The underworld around us 
Geoff Hayward 
with Tom Feigelson 
Wesley Needham has known Sterling 
Library longer than anyone. Fifty-two 
years ago he helped build it. In the in-
tervening half century he must have 
passed the check-out desk tens of 
thousands of times. But it wasn't until 
a short while ago that he noticed 
something unusual. 

High above the check-out counter, 
perched over the mural of Alma 
Mater, is a large sculpted vampire bat 
with its fangs bared in a fiendish laugh. 
Presiding over the magnificent en-
trance hall, it occupies the most com-
manding position in Sterling's 
"cathedral of learning." A position 
which in less secular cathedrals would 
be reserved for a guardi~n angel. 

In our gothic world we are sur-
rounded by stone figures which give 
lasting expression to a strange com-
mentary. Sometimes it is just distrac-
ting. Often it is satiric or secretly in-
sulting. But at times it is openly con-
deming, sacrilegious and even per-
verted. The voice comes down from 
A Y ali e and hi~ companion 
the gothic facades with unpunctuated 
insistence, but so subtly that we don't 
consciously hear it. 

On the roof of Trumbull College's 
lower courtyard is the figure of a man 
perched on a stone potty with his pants 
down around his heels. Grinning fool-
ishly, he defecates on the college 
below. "I don't like to pass it when I'm 
taking tours through the west court," 
says Needham. "I don't think it's a nice 
thing for ladies- elderly or otherwise 
-to see. I've complained about it but 
no one seems to want to take it down." 

On Trumbull's Elm and High Street 
corner, 
the humour gets more 
perverse. A relief shows a devil blow-
ing a horn as a dog mounts a drunken 
man- a symbol of sodomy. Another 
bas-relief beneath the defecating man 
shows more devils and strange ritual; a 
group of hooded and costumed people 
gather round laughing at a man in a 
coffin. The man appears to be mastur-
bating. 

The most disturbing element in it all 
is the implied sacreligion. A statue on 
Davenport's' York Street facade shows 
the Lord and the devil conspiring in a 
joke. The devil grins slyly at the Lord 
who hoots with laughter. The statue is

not garrish. And it only becomes offen-
sive when you begin to wonder what it 
was meant to symbolize. 

At the far end of Sterling Archives is 
the circular gothic vault originally used 
to house the Gutenberg Bible. Above 
the gates which protect the room are 
two suitably reverent religious figures. 
But faces of jesters and horned devil-
like creatures line the gates themselves. 

More frightening than the presence 
of the demons is their placement. Why 
devils on a gate which guarded a text of 
so much religious significance? 

In Sterling Library, the humour 
takes an anti-academic twist. Lining 
the exhibition corridor, fourteen 
statuettes give satiric renditions of 
scholars. A student reads as a cloaked 
and hooded skeleton clings to his 
shoulder. A glutonous drunken stu-
dent smokes and gawks at a pin-up 
nude. The last statuette shows a stu-
dent chortling over a book inscribed 
with the words "U.R.A. JOKE." 

Officially, at least, the statuettes 
were supposed to satirize not students 
but different types of study. All the 
same, the student reading "U.R.A. 
JOKE" seems to bear the brunt of his 
own laughter. The cryptic message is
