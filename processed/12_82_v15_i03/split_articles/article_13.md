**The Clerical and Technical Employees' Struggle for Respect**
**Author: John W. Wilhelm**
**Page number(s): 9**

"1be lack of 
respect for the 
clerical and 
technical 
employees at 
Yale is, however, 
much more 
deep-seated than 
the salary issue." 

Regardless of the quality of their work, 
their length of service, their loyalty, or 
their own needs and preferences, the 
University can, and on a daily basis 
does, hire outsiders over present 
employees who have asked for a pro-
motion or transfer. 

Exo.mple: When a job is terminated, 
which happens frequently, especially 
for those employed with grant money, 
the employee gets no preference for 
other available jobs within the U niver-
sity, regardless of qualifications, years 
at Yale, or anything else. Last spring 
about 30 employees were laid off in 
one department of the Medical School 
because of grant expirations, even 
~ho~gh at the very same time openings 
In Similar jobs were being filled with 
new hirees. 

Exo.mple: R ecently, all 10 clerical and 
technical employees in one Yale office 
were called in by their supervisor. 
They were told that in January two of 
the 10 would be laid off. They were 
told that it was not known which two 
would have to go, and that all 10 
should start looking for other jobs. 

The University's non-binding, un-
enforceable policy statements read 
more positively than these examples 
suggest-but these are realities. 

technical employees continues even 
aft~r. they retire. A typical employee 
':hnng at age 65 with 20 years of ser-
VIce gets a Yale pension of about $200 
a ~onth. A $200 Yale pension makes 
retirement a bleak reward for so many 
years of service. 

The effects on the students and the 
rest of the University community of 
this lack of respect are not widely 
understood. 

When such 
a 
large 
number of participants in the -com-
munity, performing so many vital ser-
vices, feel so ignored, the effect on the 
quality of service and the quality of life 
at Yale is profound. 

In response to their second-class 
status, Yale clerical and technical 
employees have been working hard for 
two years to organize themselves into 
Local 34, Federation of University 
Employees, AFL-CIO, a sister union 
to Local 35. 

An Organizing Committee of 400 
rank and file employees is spreading 
the word about the Union throughout 
the campus. More than half of the 
2,600 employees have already joined 
Local 34. More are joining. The 
Union organizing effort is a person-to-
person campaign, with very little 
literature or propaganda. It is based 
on employees talking to employees 
about joining together to win the 
respect they ought to have. 

When a substantial majority of the 
2,600 employees have made the deci-
sion to join Local 34, a petition for a 
secret ballot election wiJI be filed with 
the National Labor Relations Board. 

What is the University's response to 
the conclusion by clerical and technical 
employees that their interests are best 
served by organizing Local 34? Sadly, 
the University has responded no dif-
ferently 
than any profit-making 
American corporation. It has hired 
Connecticut's most notorious anti-
union law firm, Siegel, O'Connor & 
Kainen. It has already started a text-
book union-busting campaign, with 
propaganda mailed to employees, and 
with "captive audience" meetings on 
work-time, designed to pressure the 
employees and divert them from their 
day-to-day concems. 

That campaign will- following the 
standard 
union-ousting 
for-
mula- steadily intensify the pressure 
on thÂ·e employees. 

It would befit this great University 
to rise above the usual propaganda and 
pressure tactics with which corpora-
tions respond to Union organizing ef-
forts by their employees. It would befit 
Yale to listen to the employees' frustra-
tions about their lack of respect at 
Yale, and to respect the employees' 
right to join together to improve their 
lives. 

The University traveled a long, 
rocky, and decidedly unproductive 
road with Local 35 [the blue-collar 
union] before it finally concluded that 
it makes more sense to respect the 
Union than to try to destroy it. The 
blue-collar workers in Local 35 went 
on strike four consecutive times, in 
1968, 1971, 1974 and 1977. 

Although wages, benefits and work-
ing conditions were at issue in those 
strikes, the fundamental question each 
time was whether Yale would accept 
the right of its employees to bargain 
collectively. 

Finally, in the peaceful contract set-
tlements of 1980 and 1982, the Univer-
sity recognized that it is more construc-
tive and productive to approach the 
Union members as equal partners in 
the University community. 

Drawing upon that experience, why 
cannot the University reach the same 
conclusion 
with 
its clerical 
and 
technical employees before embarking 
on the road of discord and contention, 
rather than after? Why cannot this 
great University simply permit its 
to join together in Local 34 if they so 
desire, without fighting, 
without 
pressure, without corporate-style 
psychological warfare against the idea 
of the Union?
