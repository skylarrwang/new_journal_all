change, far fewer fellows eat in the col-
lege dining halls, where student-fellow 
contact most likely takes place. And 
when they do come, as Morowitz said, 
"Students and fellows seem mutually 
terrified of sitting down with each 
other at the lunch tables." 


The fellowships do benefit some 
faculty and some students greatly, at 
times. McLaughlin said, "The fellow-
ship is good for those who want it; they 
have the opportunity" for interaction . 
Most masters are discontent. Von 
Staden said that "the fellowship is 
working reasonably well" toward the 
goal of faculty interaction. But "in 
fostering contact between fellows and 
students, it falls far short of being 
realized." He stressed the value of the 
program: "With even one goal rea-
lized, the fellowships would be im-
mensely worthwhile"; however, he said 
he is "not satisfied." 


In a speech commemorating the lay-
ing of the corner-stone for Ezra Stiles 
College in February, 1961, Professor 
Richard B. Sewall, first master of Ezra 
Stiles, articulated the unique potential 
of interaction among faculty, among 
students, and between the two: "This, I 
take it, is the noblest work of these col-
leges: to facilitate conversation- the 
meeting of young with young, old with 
old, and (hardest of all) young with old 
... 'The scholarly life,' said (Professor 
Alfred North] Whitehead, 'is by nature 
solitary; it is our task to make it com-
panionable."' 


Most masters consider the "conver-
sation" to be inadequate, but the 
nature of mutual, interested interac-
tion precludes efforts to force it. 
McLaughlin said, "The artifical at-
mosphere of most fellow-and-student 
functions defeats them." Some believe 
that decreasing 
the size of the 
fellowships might envigorate them. 
Morowitz said, "Until the fellowships 
are smaller, more interested groups, 
they are not likely to achieve their 
goals." Yet the small fellowships of the 
1930s seemed no more successful than 
the contemporary ones. The true hope 
for the fellowships is probably in the 
few bright programs that inspire 
others .
