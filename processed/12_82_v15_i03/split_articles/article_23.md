**Yale College's 50th Anniversary: A Look Ahead**

ficially announce the drive next fall in 
conjunction with the actual celebra· 
tions. Both he and Naftali would like to 
link the celebration with the alumni 
gatherings in the early fall in part to 
help the fund raising. "It would be a 
good chance to give the alumni 
another look at what they are being 
asked to help," said H olcombe. 
It was Naftali who first brought a 
$50 million goal to coordinate with the 
50th anniversary, but Holcombe says 
that no real goal has been set yet. "It 
could be anywhere from $30 million up 
to say $100 million. We just won't 
know until we get a solid list of 
priorities," H olcombe said 
The center of the fund raising drive 
will be for physical improvements for 
the colleges. 
According to Jerald 
Stevens, vice-president for finance and 
administration, all the colleges except 
Morse and Stiles need infrastructure 
repairs in the near future. 
"There is definitely a need for 
renovation: roofs, plumbing, perhaps 
wiring-all need or will need major 
repair work. We are looking at the five 
to six million dollar range," said 
Stevens. 
These needs create a problem from a 
fund raising point of view. "It's very 
difficult to raise money for buildings," 
said Holcombe. "Foundations and cor-
porations are particularly unwilling to 
give for these sorts of needs. We will 
have to rely on individuals for that 
money." 
The fund drive, however, will in-
volve more than just buildings. "We 
are going to be looking at priorities not 
just in 
the 
residential 
colleges 
themselves, but in all of Yale College," 
said Holcombe. "For example, the col-
lege writing program, which affects 
more than just the residential colleges, 
may be one of the things we'll want to 
fund." Holcombe also suggested that 
the University might use this oppor-
tunity to raise badly needed financial 
aid funds. 

The party 
The least developed of all the parts of 
the 50th anniversary of the colleges is 
the plan for the actual celebration 
itself. In his freshman address Giamat-
ti placed the burden of developing 
ideas on the individual colleges. Naf-
tali, who called the celebration "a pet 
project of mine," was, if anything, less 
definite. 


"We are considering all sorts of 
things: masters' balls, gala musical per-
formances, perhaps involving other 
universities. 
The celebration 
will 
almost certainly be in the fall. The 
spring has too many other events that 
we don't want to conflict with. 
His committee hopes to receive 
recommendations from all the colleges 
and then w11l give a report to the presi-
dent. Naftali, like Holcombe would 
like to see some coordination between 
the fund raising and the celebration. 
"We will heighten awareness of the col-
lege system through the celebration " 
he said, "and then the Developme~t 
Office will solicit funds to aid the 
system." 
. ~hile he says he urges each in-
d1v1d1ual college to have its own 
celebration, Naftali seems to want at 
least some form of central celebration 
as well. "We are celebrating the 
system, 
not just the individual 
colleges." 

Student Involvement? 
The Kagan Committee has made some 
effort to publicize their existence. 
Notices have been placed in various 
campus publications soliciting written 
suggestions and Naftali made a presen-
tation to a meeting of the Yale College 
Council. According to Shemitz, she 
and Naftali plan to visit all the residen-
tial college councils in the next few 
months in the hope of soliciting more 
suggestions. "The great thing is that 
there are students involved in this," 
said Naftali. However, as of the first 
week of November, according to 
Shemitz, only one written student sug-
gestion had been received by the com-
mittee. 
Kagan said he suggested having an 
open meeting to get some student feed-
back but the idea received little support 
from the committee. Naftali said that it 
was not the time for such a meeting; he 
felt it was important for the committee 
to have some findings to present to 
such a gathering and thus use people as 
a "sounding board." Kagan said this 
was not the only reason lor opposition. 
The committee also felt that such 
meetings usually got very low turnouts 
~nd generated few original sugges-
tions. 
Beth Pardo, the Chairperson of the 
YCC, said that while the YCC had 
considered an open meeting of its own 
on the subject, there was "no formal 
"We are celebrating the 
system, not just the In· 
dlvldual colleges." 
plan" for one in the near future. 
Yet despite this lack of student par-
ticipation, all the principle people in-
volved in the planning of the celebra-
tion constantly stress the importance of 
the students in the process. "What will 
this have to do with you?" said Giamat-
ti to the freshmen . "Almost everything. 
You will be very much a part ol 1t .. 
You will be crucial to what goes forth." 
Naftali sees this as a great opportunity 
for student involvement. "For students 
who care about higher education," he 
said, "this is a unique opportunity." 
And Holcombe sees students helping 
to raise funds for the residential col-
leges by meeting with the donors and 
giving them a sense of who their 
money will really help. 
With or without further student in-
volvement, the process unveiled in the 
freshman address ·will continue to 
the celebration next fall and on into the 
fund drive. It will almost certainly 
have at least some effect on the 
residential college system as we know 
it. Kagan hopes that at the very least 
his committee will produce an ideal 
against which the residential college 
system can be judged in the future. But 
he and others hope this review process 
can do even more. 
Shemitz sees this as as "amazing op-
portunity to reevaluate the system." 
Said Naftali, "I would like to see a reaf-
firmation of our commitment to the 
residential college system. Anyway, 
nothing is perfect. The system could 
always use improving." 
Over the next few months the 
Kagan Committee will continue its ex-
amination. In April the committee 
plans to present its report to the presi-
dent and the Yale community for 
discussion and review. "I have no idea 
what we will find or suggest," said 
Kagan. "But if no one gets mad, then 
we have done a bad job." But even in 
its fmal form, the committee's report 
will only be non-binding recommenda-
tions to the president. Under these 
conditions, what effect do committee 
members hope to have? 
"I would like to see the college 
system in existence 50 years from 
now," said Naftali. "If this happens 
then the Kagan Committee has done 
an excellent job."
