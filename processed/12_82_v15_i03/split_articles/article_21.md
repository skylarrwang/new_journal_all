What does 
the future 
hold? 
Jim Lowe 
"I'm in Morse. What college are you 
in?" Hundreds of times a week, in 
classes, at SAC parties and at dinner, 
Yale students use this greeting to iden-
tify themselves. The residential col-
leges are the center of undergraduate 
life at Yale. And on September 25, 
1983 the residential college system will 
be 50 years old. 


In honor of this anniversary, the 
University has set in motion a process 
that includes the Committee on the 
Future of the Residential College 
System under the chairmanship of Pro-
fessor Donald Kagan, a multi-million 
dollar fund drive linked in part to the 
findings and recommendations of the 
Kagan Committee, and the actual 
celebration itself, scheduled for next 
fall. 


In addition, the Council on 
Priorities and Planning will examine 
the effect of the college system on the 
university as a whole. All of this activi-
ty, first announced by President A. 
Bartlett Giamatti in his freshman ad-
dress this fall, appears to be aimed at 
attempting to improve the college 
system wherever possible. 


Is there any real reason, other than 
the 50th anniversary of the system, to 
reevaluate the system? The system ap-
pears to be unique in American educa-
tion, and happily so, 
it appears. 


Almost everyone at Yale loves the col-
leges. Why tamper with the system at 
all? 


There are a few obvious reasons. 
The colleges are 50 years old and are in 
need of major repairs. Additionally, 
while in basis the system works very 
well, there are some areas such as the 
masters and fellows programs (see con-
necting articles) which could use some 
fine tuning. But the question still re-
mains, why such a substantial agenda 
for the celebration? For the answer to 
this question it is necessary to turn to 
the person who first thought to link the 
celebration with a fund drive. 


Tim Naftali, a senior in Timothy 
Dwight, says that he has been de~ply 
interested in the college system smce 
he arrived at Yale. After working with 
the TD seminar committee last year, 
he decided to seek a way to save that 
controversial and financially troubled 
program. What better time to raise 
money, he figured, than the 50th an-
niversary of the colleges. 


It was Naftali, who first brought a 
coherent plan for the celebration of the 
50th anniversary to Giamatti. The 
president had alr~ady been cc;msi?ering 
the anniversary. I focused h1s mmd on 
the process," said Naftali. Beca':'se of 
his early involvement, Naftah has 
become a central figure in the whole 
process. He is one of two students on 
the Kagan Committee and chairman 
of a committee that will recommend 
plans for the celebration. 


The study 
The Kagan Committee has the poten-
tial of being the most important entity 
to come out of the planning for the an-
niversary. This ten member committee 
of eight faculty and two students was 
charged by Giamatti'to "look out to the 
rest of the century, and recommend 
how we and our successors might con-
tinue to enhance the moral, social and 
academic- the total educational-
quality of the residential colleges." 


"When I came to the first meeting I 
thought this was going to be an im-
possible task," said Ellen Shemitz '83, 
the other student on the committee. 


Professor Kagan explained that the 
committee wants to look at the history 
of the system and see how it got to 
where it is now, evaluate what is hap-
pening in the colleges now, and finally 
make suggestions on how the indiv-
idual colleges and the system as a 
whole can be improved. 


"My own feeling," said Kagan, "is 
that the colleges are wonderful. I have 
not seen anything as good anyw.here. 
partly for that reason I have urged the 
committee not to take the present 
system for granted. Nothing should be 
completely sacred during the examina-
tion process. We should be looking for 
the best of all possible worlds." 


Specifically, subcommittees will be 
examining the physical needs of the 
colleges, such as new pipes or roofs, as 
well as topics such as teaching in the 
colleges, the fellows program, the role 
of the masters and deans and the possi-
bility of new colleges. "We are acting 
now as if there are no restrictions, 
financial or otherwise," said Kagan. 
"We're trying w create an ideal." 


But still the question remains, why 
now? "An anniversary is a good time 
for reflection," said Naftali. But that is 
not the entire motivation. "If we pro-
duced a good report it will be used by 
the Development Office to help raise 
funds," said Kagan. "We will be mak-
ing suggestions as to what is needed for 
the colleges. I hope it will help target 
the drive."

The bottom line is the money. "We're 
still at stage one in the process," ex-
plained Terry Holcombe, 
vice-
president for development and alumni 
affairs. "We are looking to the Kagan 
Committee, the Dean's Office, the 
Council of Masters and others to 
decide on priorities and then we can set 
a goal." Holcombe would like to of-
