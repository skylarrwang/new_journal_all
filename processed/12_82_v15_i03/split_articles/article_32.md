he said. 


. The discovery 
Profe11or Augustus Oemler 
A.~us .Oemler , Jr. 
discovered 
nothing last year after six years of slow 
observation and calculation. And he 
made national headlines for it. The 
"nothing" Oemler discovered was an 
empty region of space a thousand 
times the volume of anything previous-
ly known or predicted by conventional 
theories. Oemler's "nothing" tlas forced 
astrophysicists to change their ways of 
thinking. 


"Vast 'Hole' in Space Appears 
~.., 
Defy Theories" was the headline of the 
article on the front page of The New 
York Times which brought the discovery 
to the attention of the general public. 
The hole was estimated to be 300 
million light-years wide (as compared 
to the 100,000 light-year width of the 
Milky Way galaxy). A volume of that 
magnitude would typically be filled 
with- about 2,000 galaxies. 


Until this observation, scientists 
believed that the universe was basically 
smooth and that any incongruities 
were on a very small scale. This notion 
had been fundamental to the theories 
of the evolution of the universe. Only 
recently have we been able to test this 
principle. Oemler explained that his 
observation drew attention because it 
challenges the foundations of theories 


Oemler, an assistant professor of 
astronomy at Yale, began work in 1.1175 
on a large scale survey of the distribu-
tion of galaxies in space, according to 
Professor Charles Larson, chairman of 
the astronomy department. Oemler 
collaborated with Robert Kirschner of 
the University of Michigan, Paul 
Schechter of the Kitt Peak National 
Observatory, and Steven Shectman of 
the Mount Wilson Observatory. The 
original study was aimed, Oemler 
said, at looking at the distribution of 
matter throughout the universe. The 
researchers ended up stumbling upon 
nothit.g. 


The work leading up 
to the 
discovery of tho empty region was slow 
.and deliberate. The researchers would 
take a "core sample" of the sky, Oemler 
explained, focusing their attention 
through the telescope on a small area of 
space in a particular direction. "We 
looked for all galaxies brighter than a 
certain limit which we had set and then 
photographed them. We measured 
their spectra and looked for the Dop-
pler shifts of the galaxies. They are 
almost invariably moving away from 
us and we can compute their velocity 
using the Doppler shifts. We can then 
figure out their distance from their 
velocity. We also know their direction, 
and once we know these things we can 
put a galaxy at a spot in space," 
Oemler said. 


The group found three fields in the 
northern sky in which there "weren't 
any galaxies," said Oemler. The fields 
were located directionally near the con-
stellation Bootes but far beyond the 
constellation in distance from the 
earth. · 


In order to verify their observations, 
the researchers have gone back to the 
telescopes and are looking "at several 
hundred areas in that sector of the sky 
to see if we can find anything in it," 
Oemler said. So far they have not 
found anything, but they still have not 
located all the borders of the region, 
either. 


Meanwhile, 
theorists have gone 
back to the drawing board to try to 
reconcile the discovery with theories 
based on the principle of a smooth 
universe, one in which all matter is 
distributed evenly throughout. Scien· 
tists recognized that this principle was 
not entirely true, because absolute 
homogeneity would rule out galaxies, 
stars, planets and man. On a larger 
scale, 
though, 
they felt that the 
universe was basically smooth .. 


Commonly accepted theories prior 
to the discovery held that the in-
congruous "lumps" of matter that were 
present in the universe were made 
lumpier by gravity over time, and in 
this manner the planets and stars were 
formed. These came together to form 
galaxies, and these galaxies clustered 
into their present configuratioQs. The 
original incongruities were thought to 
build up gradually in a very ofderly 
process of clumping. Thus, scientists 
could use the amount of incongruity in 
the present universe to deduce what 
the universe originally looked like. 


The pancake theory 


Until the discovery of the hole, obser-
vations of incongruity in the universe 
generally upheld building-up theories. 
For example, big bang radiation is 
distributed very evenly throughout the 
universe, according to Oemler. This 
gives a picture of a relatively young 
universe that h~ built up its structure. 
The observatioll of the void, though, 
raises the question of"how the universe 
got so inc;ongruous so fast," Oemler 
said, 


Widely accepted theories can't 
answer this question, so many theorists 
are re-examining a proposal made in 
the Soviet Union about 20 years ago 
and known as the Zeldovich pancake 
theory. "Rather than the dull, slow pic· 
ture [of the building-up theories), this 
theory gives a violent, dramatic pic-
ture. The basics of the theory hold that 
at the beginning of the universe there 
were giant clouds of gas with slight in· 
congruities," such as small irreg· 
Ulariues in the density o( the clouds or 
slight mward monon on one side or the 
other, 
Oemler explained. 


Gravity 
magnified these irregularities to the 
point where the clouds collapsed into

pancalte-shaped masses of gas- very 
thin but very large. These "paricakes" 
then broke apart into clusters of galax-
ies, which fragmented into _galaxies1 
which ~en fragmented into stars and 
planets. This fragmentation would be 
much less orderly than the clumping in 
conventional theories, and thus allows 
for the observed irregularity in the 
distribution of galaxies. 


The pancake theory is upheld by 
other kinds of observations. For exam-
ple, Oemler suggested that recently 
observed long strings or sheets of 
galaxies (as opposed to the normally 
observed clusters of galaxies) are more 
easily explained by this theory. 


H owever, 
the Zeldovich pancake 
theory is far from the definitive 
answer. "There is a large amount of 
theoretical work being done on the 
structure of the univers_e," Oemler 
t.:ommented. "Our observation is just 
one p1ece of information. People's 
ideas are shifting around a lot. The 
pancake theory seems to be promising, 
but in a couple of years it may be im-
possible to account for newer observa-
tions using that theory, or tliose who 
are trying to develop the theory may 
get nowhere. And then they might go 
charging off' in another direction." 


Despite all the stir, Oernler down-
plays the signific~ce ·of his discovery. 
H e is quick to poi~t out the possibility 
that the "hole could be full of'stuff and 
as long as it doesn't shine, we'd never 
see it." He emphasizes, however, that 
scientists can only measure what can 
be observed. In the case of astronomy, 
that means the things that shine in the 
heavens. "We just have to hope that 
what we see is a good indicator of what 
is there." OemJer a:lso indicates that it 
is still really too early t<;> say what the 
full significance of the discovery is, and 
that other observations must be taken 
into account. 


Even in light of these possible limita-
tions, the discovery of nothing has 
changed, at least for now, the direction 
of astrophysics. The "hole" that Oemler 
and his colleagues stumbled upon in 
far dis~ant spate revealed a hole of 
comparable magnitude in man's ex-
Planation of his universe .
