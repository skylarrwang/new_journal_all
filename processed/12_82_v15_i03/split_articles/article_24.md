**What's the master to do?**

Ahen someone asks what I do I feel 
panicky. ~ ask myself, what do I do? 
Do I do anything? How do I define my 
own job?" said Calhoun Master Davie 
Napier. Such a comment is not un-
common among the 12 residential col-
lege masters whose role is difficult to 
define and poorly understood by most 
of the university community. The 
master can be disciplinarian, tone-
setter, advisor, grounds keeper, 
spiritual leader or scapegoat. 
Theoretically, the master is "the chief 
administrative officer of the college 
and the presiding academic presence," 
as President A. Bartlett Giamatti said 
in his freshman address this fall. In ac-
tuality, the role varies from college to 
college, from master to master. In 
some colleges the master takes an ac-
tive role, working with the seminar 
committee, the college council and the 
social activities chairmen. In others he 
or she may have less direct contact with 
student activities but affect the college 
in other ways through master's teas or 
lecture series. 
The master is also charged with en-
forcing 
the rules 
stipulated in 
Undergraduate Regulations. 
Here, 
too, the role of the master varies in 
each college. Some masters appear to 
have a policy of benign neglect, par-
ticularly when it comes to rules about 
happy hours and other SAC events. 
Others are stricter; ,last year one 
master went as far as to issue a decree 
of rustication, expelling a student from 
the college for a specified period of 
time. The master can do this when he 
or she feels a student has repeatedly or 
severely violated the regulations and 
has disrupted the life of the college. 
Given the lack of definition and con-
sistency, relations between masters 
and students are often tense and 
sometimes non-existent. "I do not 
know what the master is supposed to 
do," said john Pergande, Morse '85. 
"His defined powers have never been 
told to anyone I know. Since no one 
knows their powers, thf' masters are 
24 The New Journal/December 1, 1982 
not a major factor in college life. It 
ends up that no one even cares about 
the masters." 
Not all students feel that this lack of 
definition is necessarily that much of a 
problem. Lyle Crowley, Pierson '85, 
::al~ed the master the "spiritual leader" 
of the college. By constantly being in 
touch with students, according to 
Crowley, the master can be "very 
much on the level of the students." 
This contact helps to unify the college. 
"He definitely brings us together." 
Bridging die inconsistencies be-
tween the colleges is one goal of the 
Council of Masters. Composed of the 
12 masters, the president, the provost, 
the deans of Yale College, 
two 
associate deans and an associate pro-
vost, the Council meets as anÂ· advisory 
body to the president and as a group to 
share information, according to Coun-
cil Chairperson and Berkeley Master 
Robin Winks. In the Council, masters 
attempt to shape policy on issues affec-
ting students' lives. Through the 
Council and independently, masters 
function as information and action 
channels for student concerns and sug-
gestions. 

Useful link 
Students involved in the residential 
college councils and in social activities 
committees attest to the importance of 
masters in helping to carry out student 
proposals and activities. Yale College 
Council Chairperson Beth Pardo sees 
the Council of Masters as a "strong 
political force on campus." She ex-
plains that the YCC works closely with 
the Council, which she described as "a 
counterforce to the administration." 
She elaborated, "The masters tend to 
be more open to students than the ad-
ministration is. 
"If ther~ is something we want to do 
that we think the administration may 
not support, we go first to the Council 
of Masters. They can help us because 
they are senior faculty members and 
are influential." 
But Pardo cited problems in dealing 
with the masters that stem again from 
the lack of definition of their duties. 
"We find ik scary that we do not know 
what these powerful people are doing 
or ta,lking about. A lot of times they are 
deciding upon issues very relevant to 
students, such as SAC policies and 
hours, yet they do not solicit our opi-
nion. If students do not know what the 
Calhoun Master Davie Napier 
masters are talking ::>bout, they can not 
have any input into the decision mak-
ing." 

Masters can also be counselors. 
"The master knows the people involved 
in college activities. He> ran suggest to 
a student activities which he might en-
joy or be helped by participating in," 
said Linda Schupack, a freshman 
counselor in Silliman. 
The way the master sets the tone of 
the college is most difficult to define. 
Personality and allocation of the funds 
available allow the masters to create a 
distinct atmosphere in each college. 
"There is much room for the in-
dividual interests of masters," Napier 
said. "My field is theology. I am or-
dained and have an uncommon in-
terest in the pastoral function of the 
master. I care very much about the 
people in the college." Nidza Vizcarra, 
Calhoun '83, thinks that although 
Napier is not solely responsible for the 
"incredible closeness" of her college, his 
actions and attitude help to maintain 
it. 
Tastes and hobbies of the master can 
carry over into residential college life. 
Schuback noted that Master William 
Bennett of Silliman has special in-
terests 
in 
classical 
music and 
photography. He holds chamber music 
brunches and plans many recitals. He 
also gave money to build an excellent 
darkroom. 

Different approach 
Sitting in his office and displaying a 
pile of index cards mounted with 
freshman snapshots accompanied by 
statistics, Napier related what he 
believes is the most important part of 
his job. "At the top of my list of 
priorities is knowing students as quick-
ly as I can, as soon as possible by 
name. Once a relationship has been 
established, it is much easier f01 
students to come to me when they have 
a problem." 
Just a few hundred feet away in 
Berkeley College, Winks offered a dif-
