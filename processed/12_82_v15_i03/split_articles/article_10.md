To the Editor: 
Since Thomas McQuillen betrayed a 
certain preoccupation with medieval 
metaphor in his letter ("Russo out of 
touch," TN], October 15, 1982), I will 
respond to him in terms he can unders-
tand: Mr. McQuillen, lay off the grog! 
As co-author of the Class Day Ad-
dress, I found it difficult to locate the 
passages in the speech which caused 
McQuillen such obvious distress. 
(Perhaps I can attribute my perplexity 
to the fact that McQuillen neglected to 
cite specific passages of the speech in 
his reply.) McQuillen accuses John 
Russo (I was curiously exonerated in 
his analysis.) of "fabricating large cor-
porate dragons" and "economic 
demons" simply because he wanted 
"something to slay." Either McQuillen 
holds that the "demons" are fabricated, 
in which case he must assume corpora-
tions to be inherently moral organiza-
tions; or else he believes that the cor-
porations themselves are fabricated, in 
which case he is a fool. 

McQuillen supposes that "it 
is 
always easier to attack something no 
one can see, something no one knows 
about; no one can argue with you." It 
seems that he has underestimated his 
audience's powers of observation. I can 
see corporations; the last few people I 
asked said that they could, too. But I 
should point out that John and I did 
not "attack" corporations; we merely 
suggested that graduating seniors 
should be cognizant of corporate in-
fluence and should exert pressure, 
whether internally or , externally, on 
such institutions to act with ethical 
responsibility. 

I suspect that McQuillen neglected 
to (re)read our speech when he wrote his 
response, and that he had a few of his 
own dragons to slay. If so, I am 
justified in strongly protesting his 
assertion that "Russo is insincere." 
Sincerity, 
Mr. McQuillen, 
no 
harder to see than the "corporate 
demons" that you insist are figments of 
our imagination. You have only to 
look.

**Letters: vee and JCSC: student leaders respond**
**Author: Betsy Goldmuntz**

Morris Fanner's article ("Student 
government: critique and reform," 
TNJ, October 15, 1982), raises several 
issues that deserve attention. These in-
clude the formalization of residential 
college councils, the coordination of 
the latter with the Yale College Coun-
cil (YCC) and the coordination of the 
YCC and the Joint Committee of 
Social Chairpersons (JCSC). 

As 
chairperson of the Ezra Stiles College 
Council, I witnessed the benefits of 
allowing 
a 
formal, 
elective 
body 
distribute funds among various college 
activities. This not only encourages 
people to buy SAC cards when they see 
that many activities are funded, but it 
also ensures that the Social Committee 
will be responsible to a consistent, 
elected group of students. 

Having listened to many YCC 
reports and the YCC representatives' 
pleas for student input, I would agree 
that some coordination between the 
college councils and the YCC would 
lend support to that ever-criticized 
organization. Moreover, it is worth 
noting that last year's Ezra Stiles 
Council never even mentioned JCSC 
activities, and that lately many 
students have expressed their desire to 
hold back funds from the JCSC while 
still contributing to the residential col-
lege SAC funds. 

While Fanner's proposal does not 
necessarily provide the best answer to 
these problems, it finally brings the 
question of formalization and coor-
dination of student government to the 
foreground.

"Money talks," or so Morris Panner 
assumes in his article ("Student Govern-
ment: critique and reform" TNJ, Oct. 
15, 1982). If the Yale College Council 
(YCC) were to be given control of the 
funds currently administered by the 
Joint Council of Social Chairpersons 
(JCSC), both organizations would 
supposedly gain the support and con-
fidence of the student body. Through 
an elaborate reorganization of dollars 
and representatives from the YCC, the 
JCSC and the twelve residential col-
lege councils, a newfound, popular in-
terest in student governance would be 
sparked, and a united student voice 
would emerge. 

What this voice would say is still not 
clear to me. Would it announce each 
week's SAC events, or would it plea for 
student input on matters of academic 
and administrative policy? What I 
suspect might happen is that the new 
Student Senate would not produce a 
clear representative voice at all. In-
stead, it would promote a great deal of 
friction between two distinct groups of 
students (the former SAC people and 
the former YCC crowd) over the fate 
of a communal pool of money. I don't 
think it is possible to form a productive 
student committee which must be both 
a political voice and a social activities 
planner. Discussion about the long-
term implications of a foreign language 
requirement just doesn't mix with the 
planning of a happy hour. 

Panner is absolutely correct in assert-
ing that Yale really has no represen-
tative student government. Yet the 
proposed marriage of the YCC with 
the JCSC (or perhaps more accurately, 
with the JCSC's money) will not 
guarantee the campus wide support 
which the YCC needs in order to be 
able to influence the Yale administra-
tion. It is critical that the YCC become 
recognized 
as a 
spokesman for 
students' interests. One way to gain 
that recognition is by actively seeking 
out student opinion on specific issues 
(via questionnaires, telephone surveys, 
etc.) 
and 
then presenting them 
forcefully to the administration. Cer-
tainly the YCC can not obtain the 
power and influence which it needs 
simply by playing ogre over the coffer 
for students' social activities.
