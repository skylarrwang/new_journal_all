Rogers." Why would Rogers lend his 
credibility to an artist whose work w..as 
so universally disliked? A personal 
friendship? Maybe, but it may also 
have been because their senses for 
satire were so compatible. 


A university possessed 
T he mocking spirit of James Gamble 
Roger s found expression in more than 
j ust 
decorations. The buildings 
themselves are his greatest commen-
tary. In some cases, as with the Law 
School, he chose to make fun-house 
reflections of Oxford and Cambridge. 
Other times, imitations gave way to 
elaborate parody. 


T he main entrance hall of Sterling 
Library is a mock cathedral. Confes-
sional booths have become telephone 
booths; the altar is used as a check-out 
counter; scenes from the passion play 
became scenes from the history of 
Connecticut; the portrait of the Virgin 
Mary is replaced by one of Alma 
Mater; and the Holy Book is converted 
into what seems to be an early version 
of the Blue Book. 


There isn't necessarily anything 
more than good wholesome fun behind 
Rogers' architectural punning. But ob-
vious 
explanations for his multi-
million dollar play on buildings were 
never entirely accepted. A 1931 issue 
of the Harkness Hoot, asked "Is there 
any honesty in hiding the magnificent 
function of a tower of books under a 
cloakage that has no more relevance to 
it than to a grain elevator? ... All 
this, in the university whose motto is 
Lux and Veritas. There is not one sug-
g~stion of Veritas in the Sterling 
Ltbrary, and for that matter there is 
precious little of Lux." 


Sterling is the showpiece of Yale's 
mutant gothic style, 
but Rogers' 
ca~edral of learning makes tribute to 
netther d ivinity nor scholarship. It is 
perhaps a 
monument only to its 
creator. And if, as is inscribed on the 
~ain entrance of Sterling, "The 
Ltbrary is the H eart of the University," 
what does this elaborate farce say 
about Yale? 


. Yale used to be a cam pus of open 
VIstas with unassuming architecture in 
the style of Connecticut Hall. But 
when Rogers took over as consulting 
architect, Yale began to close herself 
Over the sh oulder 
in. Gothic facades, erected with the 
money of the roaring twenties and the 
labour of the dirty thirites, made for a 
city of fortresses, each guarded by its 
stone walls, moat and spiked iron 
gates. T he walls are austere, the moats 
enclosing, the gates forbidding. 


And even those who enter the sanctu-
ary of the inner courtyards face the per-
sistent satire of sculptures that question 
their right to be there. There is nothing 
inviting or reassuring about devils 
overlooking people masturbating in 
coffins. Nor is there much majesty in a 
man sitting on potty. And whether it's 
a jester triumphing over justice, or a 
devil laughing at the Lord, or a ddg 
mounting a man, these sculptures 
throw into doubf the values which a 
university should hold sacred. How 
much of it do we unknowingly hear 
and how much of it can we safely ig-
nore when we walk in Rogers' world?
