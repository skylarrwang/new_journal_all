Profile 
Anthony Appiah: God's natural aristocrat 
Kathleen Cleaver 
Appiah on the Green 
Before the harp recital began, the 
guests at a fashionable party in a 
Gloucestershire home were convers-
ing over drinks one evening in 1971. 
A retired British officer, dressed in 
tweeds, ambled over to the tall, 
brown-skinned young man he did not 
recognize. 

"I say, old chap, do you speak 
English?" he bluntly inquired. 

"Why don't you ask my grand-
mother," Anthony Appiah answered 
curtly, in his impeccable upper class 
British accent. 

"Who, may I ask, rs your grand-
mother?" he rejoined weakly. 

"Lady Cripps," Appiah replied, as 
he turned to listen to the music. 

The retired officer stood there as-
tounded. Lady Isabel Cripps was the 
most distinguished person at the par-
ty. As the widow of Sir Stafford 
Cripps, who became the Labour Par-
ty's Chancellor of the Exchequer 
following World War II, Lady Cripps 
was known throughout the British 
Commonwealth. Sir Stafford Cripps 
had been a vigorous advocate of in-
dependence for Britain's colonial 
possessions as far back as the 1930s, 
an outspoken Christian socialist, and 
during World War II had been Bri-
tain's Ambassador to the 
Soviet 
Union. Carrying on the tradition of 
30 The New Journal/December 1, 1982 
outstanding public leadership that 
had marked his family for genera-
tions, Cripps made a powerful impact 
on British politics during his lifetime. 

Last year, Anthony Appiah (pro-
nounced Ah-pee-ah), the surprising 
African at the cocktail party, became 
DUS of Yale's Afro-American Studies 
Program. A descendant of Asante 
kings and British lords, he reflects an 
elegant fusion of African and English 
culture in his scholarship, his per-
sonality, and even in the musical 
rhythm of his speech. He was th~ first 
African 
to 
receive 
a 
Ph.D. 
in 
philosophy from Cambridge. He was 
the first African to be inducted into a 
secret society at Cambridge. And 
when he taught at the University of 
Ghana, 
he was the first 
faculty 
member to lecture in traditional 
Asante dress. But here at Yale, he 
regularly takes t_ea at the Elizabethan 
Club and does his writing on a word 
processor. "Anthony is the best DUS 
in the history of the program," said 
Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Professor 
of English and Afro-American 
Studies. "He brings a 
uniquely 
cosmopolitan blend of personal and 
educational experiences 
Afro-
American Studies, and he is the best 
person in this country doing work m 
African philosophy." 

''The Red Squire" 
Akroma-Ampin Kusi Kwame Appiah 
was born in London in 1954. He was 
the first child of Joe Appiah, an ardent 
agitator for African independence, and 
Peggy Cripps, the youngest daughter 
of Isabel and Stafford Cripps. Their 
wedding ir- London in 1953 made 
headlines around the world. The Ap-
piahs settled in Kumasi, the capital of 
the Asante kingdom in central Ghana, 
known as "the garden city of West 
Africa." A dynamic attorney, Joe Ap-
piah served in Prime Minister Kwame 
Nkrumah's first parliament, but his 
outspoken support for trade unions 
soon 
put him 
opposition 
Nkrumah. During the turbulent early 
days of Ghana's independence J oe Ap-
piah wound up in prison for his stand. 

Joe Appiah was still in prison in 
1962 when Queen Elizabeth and 
Prince Philip made a state visit to 
Ghana. One of the stops on the royal 
couple's tour was a hospital where An-
thony, eight years old at the time, hap-
pened to be a patient. Prince Philip 
greeted Anthony and told him to give 
his regards to Peggy Appiah. In-
furiated that the royalty had payed so 
much attention to Appiah's family, 
Nkrumah had 
Anthony's doctor 
deported. With her husband in jail and 
her younger daughters to look after, 
Peggy Appiah concluded it would be 
best to send Anthony off to England 
before another outrageous incident oc-
curred. She enrolled him in a small 
boarding school near her mother's 
home in the Gloucestershire coun-
tryside. 

Lady Cripps' cottage became Ap-
piah's second home. 
Until he 
graduated from Cambridge in 1975, 
Appiah spent his school years in 
England and his summers in Ghana. 
He became very close to his grand-
mother, and was surrounded by a large 
family of uncles, aunts and cousins 
who lived near his grandmother's 
village. The Cripps children had been 
socially ostracized by their neighbors 
who considered Sir Stafford Cripps, 
whom they dubbed "The Red Squire," 
a traitor to his class. 

Insulated within a close family both 
in Ghana and England, Appiah re-
mained largely unaware of racism until 
he reached 18. "Though there were 
episodes in my childhood in Ghana 
which were partly racial," he explained, 
"my experience- and this may simply 
have been because we were protected 
-was living in a home with a white 
inother and a black father and having 
friends who were European, African 
and Indian, and never thinking that 
was remotely strange." At Bryanston, 
the prestigious British 'public school' he 
attended, Appiah continued to be 
sheltered. 

Appiah's first extended stay in Lon-
don changed all that. After graduating 
from Bryanston, Appiah and a group 
of British and African classmates spent 
the summer in London preparing to 
stage the British premiere of a play 
about the 1960 assassination of Patrice 
Lumumba, the first Prime Minister of 
the Congo. "I suppose it was spending 
a lot of time in London with black 
Africans that made me somewhat 
aware for the first time that racism
