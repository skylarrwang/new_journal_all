A vampire hovers over Sterling Library 
more contemptuous than it is clever. 
Are we meant to laugh at the book, at 
the student, or at ourselves? 
One could go on and on. At the Law 
School, cynical, anti-academic jokes 
abound. On the tops of the finials, four 
foot sculpted animals conduct a "mock 
trial" over the whole Law School. 
Wolves and parrots dress up as 
lawyers; their clients are donkeys and 
goats with money bags. On Grove 
~treet, Justice falls at the mercy of a 
Jester; her scales tip as a fool in cap and 
bells pulls a blindfold down over her 
eyes. 

There is something discpmforting 
about the fun these buildings have at 
our expense. "It's not really very fun-
ny," protests former Master of Trum-
bull George Lord. "There is an eclec-
ti~ism about it all which is very distur-
bmg. Unlike at Oxford and Cam-
bridge, the architecture here is inward 
looking with a hostile streak toward the 
rest of the world." 

There is something odd in using an 
architecture to portray 
people 
defecating or devils masturbating 
when the institution is supposedly 
devoted to loftier pursuits. There is 
SO~ething dishonest about a building 
W~•ch on its facades pays reverent 
tribute to divinity and in its interior 
~akes a lasting and bitter mockery of 
It. "I think it's a little gross and a little 
demeaning," says Lord. "On a public 
act of creation an architect cannot ig-
nore the symbolism of his work." 

But the architect, James Gamble 
1, Rogers, was not one to ignore the little 
~ things in a building. He must have 
known. "[Rogers' firm] had been 
organized as very much an extension 
of his own personality." writes his 
grandson J. G. Rogers III. "It had 
been organized both to allow him max-
imum control over every aspect of the 
businesJJ and maximum freedom for 
himself . . . Rogers' control on the 
design of the buildings went virtually 
unchecked." As Yale's consulting ar-
chitect, Rogers had the power to create 
his own little university. In less than a 
decade he built the "new Yale"; 
Harkness Tower, Sterling Memorial 
Library, the Law School, the Grad 
School, and nine of the coll~ges. He 
did it all with an obsession for detail, 
and a mania for control which set him 
apart from other architects. 

Rogers had little respect for the 
quibbling university committees set up 
to keep him in check. As they sat 
heatedly debating whether or not an 
apple should appear at Isaac Newton's 
feet, he wrote, "I shall be very glad to 
do any or all of the work of the com-
mittee but there will arise a time when 
the builders have to have models. In 
fact, they are howling for them now. 
Yes, howling is the word." 

Rogers repeatedly ignored the com-
mittee's ban on carving busts of living 
people. He made sure he and his 
designers were immortalized in Indi-
ana limestone wherever possible .. But 
his egotism went beyond the desire to 
see his smiling face. As Yale's architect 
supreme, he was the author of a world 
of stone, and he was not above leaving 
a few cryptic messages. 

Take the curious juxtaposition of 
two roof sculptures on symmetricaJly 
opposite sides of Sterling Library. One 
is a Yale student bowed over his boob 
as though in prayer. The other, a 
horned demon with a spiked tail, hun-
ches over in the same pose. A long, 
thick, phallic tongue thrusts ~mt past 
his chin as he grasps somethmg un-
rt!cognizable tightly ag~st. ~s _pelvis 
When viewed side by s1de, 1t 1s hard to 
see the demon as anything but a satiric 
corruption of the Yalie. Bu~ i~s ~ot a 
connection the average tounst IS likely 
to make. The demon is hidden behind 
Grinning foolishly, the figure 
defecates on the college 
below. 

the Reserve R eading Room. so the two 
sculptures cannot be viewed simultan-
eously. 

All the same, the connection seems 
to have been deliberate and more than 
one person must have known about it. 
Plaster models for most of the library's 
sculptures were made, and shown to 
Rogers for approval. A Yale archives 
picture collection shows photographs 
of each model. 

But, the collection also shows that in 
the case of the two roof sculptures, a 
singular exception was made. Someone 
moved model 31 (the student) next to 
model 98 (the demon) and took a pic-
ture of them side by side. A strange 
statement about students, which might 
otherwise have been overlooked, 
became strikingly obvious. Whoever 
took that picture and whoever saw it 
knew about the satiric relation between 
the sculptures. And it seems likely that 
one of these people was the prankster 
who divined it. 

The same queer sense of humor is at 
work on the book tower of Sterling 
Library. Beneath a set of gothic win-
dows, are four bas relief heads. On the 
far left is a yale (the two horned 
mythical beast)-a symbol of the 
University. On the far right is a stu-
dent dressed up in a cap and tassle- a 
symbol of scholarship. Between them 
are two savage demons with fangs 
bared in threatening grimace. 

This mixing of satanic symbols with 
scholarly ones is too blatant to have 
escaped Rogers' discerning eye. The 
four heaas are so high up and so close 
together that they appear more as a 
group than as individuals. And no 
matter how you interpret it, the por-
trait isn't flattering of either Yale or her 
students. 

Not all of this architectural cant has 
gone unnoticed. Even as "the New 
Yale" was still taking form, a 'i930 
issue of the Harkness Hoot leveled its bit-
ter criticism. "It violates all canons of 
good taste by deliberately misusing the 
Gothic details with which it abounds. 
How can students be educated to ar-
tistic appreciation under the eaves of 
an architecture that puts water tanks in 
church towers, and lavatories in oriels? 
It seems dubious what lesson of hones-
ty the young man can derive from such 
m isuses and untruths." 

Yale lecturer Lila Freedman writes, 
"But what is most curious is that many 
[of the Law School ornaments] are 
deliberately satiric, implicitly com-
menting upon or even explicitly mock-
ing the very concepts that presumably 
are taught within the building itself." 

Says Lord, "This architecture has a 
lot of authority and it's conditioning 
people all the time. I think it's enclos-
ing and very insistent. 
I 
think 
undergraduates 
are 
negatively 
af-
fected, 
irritated and finally 
even 
depressed by it." 

Why? 
Wh" would an institution like Yale 
portray through its ornaments so much 
cymc1sm about the values of educa-
tion? Why a jester triumphing over 
Justice? Why all the animals dressed 
up as magistrates and lawyers? Why all 
the portrayals of drunken and deca-
dent students? Why the recurring con-
nections ·between students and 
demons? 

According to Yale legend, the drafts-
men did it. The story goes that under-
paid Italian stone masons decided to 
vent their frustrations against an elitist 
institution by carving their insults into 
the buildings. And when they tired of 
carving insults, they decided to carve 
themselves. In the front arches ofHGS 
appear the faces of all the draftsmen. 

But this common knowledge ex-
planation is more myth than fact, said 
History of Art professor Vincent Scul-
ly. "These stories of spontaneous crea-
tion 
and happy draftsmen 
have 
developed afterward~ ... I say I'd be 
willing to bet that you could find 
sketches for every one (of the or-
naments.)" 

Wesley Needham, whose face is 
carved in the right hand archway of 
HGS, remembers the decision to por-
tray draftsmen on the building. Like 
all other decisions about ornaments, it 
came from the architectural designer 
and not from the draftsmen them-
selves. 

Sketches for ornaments 
originated as a rule in the office of the 
head designer. James Gamble Rogers 
would review the sketches at a weekly 
session. In the case of the faces of 
HGS, he seems to have given approval 
even though it was another flagrant 
violation of the University Decoration 
Committee guidelines. 

In fact, an effort may have been 
made to hide some of the more offen-
sive 
statues from 
the draftsmen. 
Needham remembers that the man on 
the potty was not on the plans for 
Trumbull's west courtyard. He says 
that the plans he worked on showed 
only a 1 straightforward finial. Needham 
admits he really doesn't know how the 
potty man got there, but he figures that 
it must have been put on afterwards by 
undergraduates because, "No faculty 
member would ever do that." He adds, 
"It is perfectly formed over the finial. It 
is well done . . . I would like to know 
how they did it." 

But it seems that undergrads had 
nothing to do with it. Photographs 
show the potty man on his throne 
shortly after the building was finished. 
The pictures created a bit of a stir, and 
Rogers made no effort to deny respon-
sibility. 

Another explanation for the satire is 
that architect and chief designers used 
satiric'!.l ornament:: in an attempt to 
mimic : the medieval gothic style. 
"They thought they were being very 
medieval," Scully says. "These people 
were acting out of a social myth about 
~othic architecture." Nothing sinister, 
JUSt a failed naive attempt to 
i,mitate 
the expression of a long lost architec-
ture. 

But this explanation is only slightly 
better than the creative draftsmen 
theory. Rogers and his designers did 
not think of themselves as curators of a 
gothic tradition but creators of a new 
style. In an article on Trumbull Col-
lege architecture, Needham describes 
how the work of chief designer John 
Donald Tuttle was to innovate and 
develop a new "modern gothic" or-
namentation. Needham relates how 
Tuttle regularly substituted his own or-
naments for traditional gothic. 

~yond the potty and the devil 
~hefs, one recurring "modern-gothic" 
•dc:a was to plaster •_he college with 
anamals. In the arches of Trumbull one 
finds serpents, bats, frogs, and sharks. 
A number of large rats adorn the cen-
tral set of windows on Elm Street.
