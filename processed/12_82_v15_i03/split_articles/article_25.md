ferent view of a master's priorities. He 
feels that a master's visibility in the col-
~ege is not necessarily his most impor-
tant function. "If a master is too visi-
ble, he is not serving the best interests 
of the students. He can get more done 
behind the scenes. Accessibility is very 
important; visibility is cosmetic and 
less important," he said. 

Students often form their opinions 
about their master depending on h is 
level of visibility. Pergande explained, 
"The only time I ever see our master is 
when he is issuing a decree of some-
thing we cannot do. He seems to have 
no great involvement in the college." 

William Hallo, Morse's new master, 
has stirred some resentment among 
students who feel he is not sufficiently 
attuned to or involved in student ac-
tivities. 

Students 
like 
Rhonda Reaves, 
Trumbull '85, who think the master 
should function as a "den-parent," 
~rgue that day-to-day contact i8 very 
tmportant. However, some students 
feel visibility strains relationships be-
tween students and masters. 

Berkeley senior Chris Kafoglis ex-
plained, "Students approach those who 
might control their daily lives in an 
anxious and mistrustful way. Thus, 
the masters are operating from the 
beginning without the trust of the 
students. The less visible the master is, 
the better, because if he is visible, peo-
ple feel they are being regulated." 

The vision of master solely as rule 
enforcer helps to explain last year's stu-
dent protest of Trumbull Master 
M ichael Cooke's rustication of Roy 
Jenkins '84. In response to Jenkins' 
" malicous parody" of Trumbull's 
newsletter, Cooke issued a decree, 
later rescinded 
which 
rusticated 
J enkins for two ~eeks. One hundred 
students responded to the decree with a 
Protest in the Trumbull common room 
6()d a petition against the master which 
~rcent of T rumbullians signed.

tion decree last year are caused by un-
familiarity with the rules until they are 
enforced. Another cause of student 
frustration toward the masters is the 
lack of awareness of the unwritten and 
often unseen activities of masters. 

These frustrations exist especially in 
colleges where day-to-day interactions 
are minimal. 

Students are not the only people 
frustrated with the lack of definition of 
the masters' role. The masters them-
selves often do not know exactly what 
their position in the college is supposed 
to be. Adding to their difficulties, the 
University sees the mastership as only 
a half-time job. During their five-year 
terms, masters are expected to teach 
half of their normal course loads. John 
Hall, a professor of Japanese h istory 
and a former master of Morse, ex-
plained 
some of the 
difficulties 
academics encounter when they take 
the job of master. "Being a master is a 
full-time job. It is all-consuming. It is 
very difficult for a professor who is 
primarily a scholar to take over the 
job." 

Masters also find that completing 
the tasks they are expected to perform 
is not always easy. Lack of personnel 
and cooperation often cause frustra-
tion. Hall said, "The master is respon-
sible for 
everything without 
the 
machinery to do it. He is powerless to 
do the job himself. He must learn what 
buttons to push." 

But through it all, most of the 
masters appear to enjoy their posi-
tions. "The rewards of being a master 
are tremendous," said Napier. "fm 
given the privilege of living with some 
of the finest young people to be found 
in the world."
