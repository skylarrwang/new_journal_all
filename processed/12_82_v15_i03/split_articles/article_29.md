mattered," Appiah said. "It was cer-
tainly there all the time I was in 
England. I just wasn't in a position to 
notice it." 


The language of discrimination 
In the fall of 1972 Appiah entered 
Clare College at Cambridge to study 
medicine. He soon became the only 
male 
member of the Cambridge 
women's movement. It was then that 
the fundamental similarity between 
racism and sexism became apparent to 
him. 


Appiah has since become convinced 
that discrimination is not just a matter 
of how people treat each other- it has 
to do with language. "As a philosopher 
of language," said Appiah. "I am in-
terested in the degree to which it is 
reasonable to try 
to change the 
language- those facts about the way the 
language works, for example, and how 
the masculine nouns are used as a sort 
of indefinite form. I used to think it 
was silly to spend a lot of time fussing 
about the language, because the real 
issues won't change because you stop 
talking a certain way. But now I think 
that is not true. The effort to change 
the language is, in itself, liberating to a 
degree." 


"Everybody knows we don't want to 
use terms of abuse which are sexist or 
racist," he continued. "But while 'col-
ored' doesn't have to be a term of 
abuse, it does have built into it the idea 
that being white is the normal state of 
human beings, and that everyone else 
is 'colored,' that is, yellow people are 
'colored yellow,' as opposed to white. It 
is the way that language appropriates 
certain things as the normal, and then 
automatically consigns you to the 
periphery if you're not a man or not 
white." 


But the use of language goes beyond 
ascribing inferiority to women and 
ethnic minorities. "The important 
thing to bear in mind in thinking about 
sexism and racism," Appiah explained, 
"is that although the key issue in both 
is injustice, it is not the case that non-
whites are the only people who suffer 
from racism, or that non-males are the 
only people who suffer from sexism. 
It's restrictive to have a certain form of 
masculinity imposed on you just 
because you're male. And though I 
think the worst aspects of sexism 
damage women most, and the worst 
aspects of racism damage black people 
more than they damage white people, 
still, it does damage males and whites. 
So they have an interest in liberating 
themselves from it too." 


A double first 
At Cambridge, Appiah met "Skip" 
Gates, who had just graduated from 
Yale and had won a fellowship to study 
at Clare College. The two became 
friends immediately. Gates brought 
Appiah in touch with the radical 
upheavals which had shaken America 
since the 1960s. The Bobby Seale trial, 
the May Day rallies, and the union 
strike had all taken place during Gates' 
undergraduate years at Yale. He and 
Appiah spent many hours together, 
sometimes staying up 
all 
night, 
discussing the situation facing 
Africans and Afro-Americans from the 
perspective of the black power strug-
gles raging in the United States. 


"Anthony rarely attended lectures, 
which were not required at Cam-
bridge," Gates recalled. "Instead, he 
would stay up all night reading, or 
talking, then sleep most of the day. He 
enjoyed an active social life. He was 
very popular-witty, handsome, char-
ming- the life of the party. Regardless 
of what Anthony did, it was never 
flamboyant 
or offensive. 
His 
philosophy tutor called him 'God's 
natural aristocrat."' 


Appiah nearly failed his medical ex-
ams his first year at Cambridge. Then 
he switched to philosophy. He became 
the only philosophy student in his 
graduating class to win what at Cam-
bridge is called a 'double first'- highest 
possible marks in both second and 
third year finals. After graduating 
from Cambridge, Appian returned to 
Ghana to do a year of national service. 
He had no clear idea of what he would 
do until the day he received a telegram 
from Cambridge telling him he'd got-
ten a double first. "I had never con-
sidered being an academic philospher," 
Appiah said. "but with that piece of 
paper I felt I could ask for a job 
teaching philosophy at the University 
of Ghana." During the year he spent 
teaching, Appiah startled both the 
faculty and the students by wearing 
traditional Asante dress while he lec-
tured, something no one had ever done 
before. 


In 1978 Appiah came to Yale as a 
Special Student after receiving a Ph.D. 
in 
philosophy at Cambridge. 
A 
graduate student in one of Appiah's 
seminars, 
Dominic 
Parisi, 
remembered him well. "Sometimes I 
would see him during the day and it 
was obvious he'd been up all night 
reading," Parisi said. "For the most 
part, he was a quiet, introspective, 
reflective person, very British in style. 
He has a command of the English 
language like a character in a 19th cen-
tury novel. Hearing him talk about 
anything is like listening to music. But 
his appeal as a teacher was not so much 
in what he said, but in his presence, his 
warmth, and his genuine interest in his 
students." 


Appiah's work 
Appiah is now an Assistant Professor 
of Philosophy and Afro-American 
Studies, a combination which many 
people initially find perplexing. But 
Appiah has the rare ability to explain 
the complex and obscure in clear, 
precise language. His work, like his 
personality, is a perfect balance of so 
many diverse elements. "The thing 
that ties together a large part of what I 
do in philosophy," Appiah explained, 
"is a concern with understanding 
cultures other than our own, inter-
preting cultures to each other, and 
understanding language within 
a 
culture. And that is what philosophers 
call the 'theory of meaning.' How do 
these inert shapes and sounds come to 
acquire meaning, and what are we do-
ing with them? Because language pro-
vides the medium in which we conduct 
our discussions about serious ques-
tions, the philosophy of language is 
useful in that it allows us to sharpen 
those tools and keep clear about how to 
use 
them 
without endangering 
ourselves." 


Appiah, who grew up speaking 
English and Twi, the language of the 
Asante, finds his linguistic flexibility to 
his advantage 
as 
philosopher. 
"Although most of the work 
philosophy has been done in a small 
subset of Indo-European languages," 
he said, "some of the features of Twi 
which are different from 
those 
languages are very helpful in escaping 
philosophical error -I think a lot of the 
puzzles and worries about 'existence' 
in the Western tradition are hard to fall 
into in a language in which it is dif-
ficult to talk of existence as a concept. 
You can talk about what there is-but 
the emphasis is on being a thing, or be-
ing a person. But, on the whole, I 
think the abstract notion of existence 
has produced more muddle than in-
sight whether in the Latin, or Greek, 
or modern European discussions." 


One of the problems in African 
philosophy that Appiah is working on is 
finding a way to articulate the way the


Asante view the relationships between 
gods, spirits and humans. "I am in-
terested in the theoretical questions of 
how one goes about the process of 
transforming an understanding of a set 
of alien concepts." 


The Asante understanding of the 
relationship between the mind and the 
body, for example, is different from 
the common-sense view in the West. 
"For the last 300 years in the West," 
Appiah explained, "people have been 
trying to tear the mind from the body 
in various unsatisfactory ways. The 
standard Western concept is 
that 
minds and bodies are pretty distinct 
sorts of things, and that minds can ex-
ist without bodies, as in the conception 
of the soul. I happen to think that this 
is a pretty incoherent notion. One of 
the interesting things about the tradi-
tional 
philosophical 
views of the 
Asante about minds and bodies is that 
they don't have this dualistic view. 
They see them as very much bound up 
with one another." 


In Twi, many of the words for the 
emotions express this relationship. 
"For example," Appiah said, "'I'm 
angry' is literally translated 'my eyes 
are red.' That is, the emotion words 
are tied into their physical manifesta-
tions. The concepts people ordinarily 
use to understand each other are dif-
ferent, and they need to be examined 
and understood." 


Models of the mind 
Elizabeth Archibald, Acting Dean of 
Morse College, came to Yale, like Ap-
piah, several years after graduating 
from Cambridge. A native Briton, Ar-
chibald is intrigued by the ease with 
which Appiah has adapted to Yale 
while preserving his own style. "An-
thony is in essence like an 18th century 
country gentleman," she said. "He is so 
gracious, so unhurried. But yet, there 
is a paradox: he has a 
computerized 
telephone. And I am surprised at how 
adept he 
is 
at using 
the 
word 
processor." 


Appiah is a scholar who is fascinated 
by the computer. He does all of his 
writing on a word processor (he is cur-
rently at work on three books) because 
he finds it far more congenial to think-
ing than a typewriter. "Computers 
eliminate the drudge work that other-


wise you would have to get people to 
do," said Appiah. "But what is most in-
teresting is that because we have had to 
build computers to duplicate things 
people do, we have learned in the pro-
cess things about how the mind works." 


Appiah sees the computer as a model 
of the relationship between the mind 
and the brain, 
between the 
psychological and the physiological. 
"There is a difference in the way an 
engineer understands a computer and 
the way a programmer understands it. 
It is not the engineer's way, but the 
programmer's way that is interesting 
to me. The machine illustrates how 
there can be two radically different 
ways of understanding the same 
thing." 


The computer, in effect, has both a 
mind and a brain. Appiah explains that 
while a computer engineer is concern-
ed with the physical hardware of the 
machine (as a neurosurgeon might try 
to understand the biochemistry of the 
brain), a computer programmer must 
consider the software's psychologi-
cal process (as a 
psychologist 
might 
analyze the inner workings of the 
mind). An engineer and a programmer 
might confront the same problem in a 
computer and describe it in completely 
different ways. 


But, Appiah cautions, "It is very im-
portant to understand what kind of 
model the computer is, and to be very 
clear that it is only a model. Only some 
of its features are relevant to an 
understanding of the brain. In par-
ticular, I think that the computer 
model doesn't really tell us anything 
about the relationship between beliefs 
and the world. What it does tell us 
about is the relationships between 
beliefs and other beliefs. The computer 
is the only man-made machine where 
the relationship between the different 
levels of describing how it works are so 
incredibly rich." 


For Anthony Appiah, it is the most 
intricate, the most complex aspects of 
language- cultural 
language, 
philosophical language, technological 
language- that are so compelling. 
"Philosophy is complicated," he said. 
"That's what makes it fun."
