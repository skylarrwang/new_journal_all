**Finding out the fellows**
**Author: Katherine Scobey**
**Page number(s): 26-27**

No one is happy with the college 
fellowships. Students wonder what the 
fellows do. Fellows and masters know 
what the fellowships do and see how 
they faJI short of their potential. All 
agree that residential college life could 
be tremendously enriched by stronger 
fellowships. 

Somehow, 
"they are 
healthy in only about half of the col-
leges," according to Robin Winks, who· 
is chairman of the Council of Masters 
and m.aster of Berkeley College. 

Throughout the colleges the main 
purpose of the fellowships is twofold-
to bring faculty together arid to bring 
faculty and students together. Most 
students are only concerned with the 
second goal. They assume the fellow-
ships exist for students, as a group of 
advisors or as a link with the faculty. 
Thus, when the fellows meet without 
students, as they usually do, students 
wonder what "those teachers who eat in 
the dining halls" are doi~g, and they 
consider the feUowships rather ineffec-
tual. 

"The fellowships are not necessarily 
for the students," said Emmet 
McLaughlin, a 
resident fellow of 
Davenport College. For fellows and 
masters, the primary value of the 
fellowships is the bringing together of 
faculty of different departments. 

Heinrich von Staden, lJlaster of Ezra 
Stiles College, points to the "intellec-
tual cross-fertilization" resulting from 
the fellowships; 
when 
faculty get 
together, they teach each other, and 
they breed ideas. Fellows and masters 
also work toward interaction of faculty 
and students; however, this has not 
been very effective. 

A different purpose 

As originally implemented in 1933, the 
residential college system provided for 
only 12 faculty members for each col-
lege fell<;>wship, but their specific pur-
pose was unclear. George Pierson, the 
university historian, who has been a 
fellow of Davenport College since 
1933. witnessed the "unexpected" 
operation of the program. "There was 
great excitement at the rediscovery of · 
faculty." Yale became, he ~akl, .. 
~a talk-
ing university" as the faculty of the 
various departments came together.. · 
The fellowships became a sort of facul-
ty club, not by design, but in effect. 

A~ the university grew, the 
fellowships 
grew. Then .during 
Kingman Brewster's presidency, the 
Mandatory Rule was passed and ef-
fected what Winks described as the 
"democritizing" of the fellowship pro-
gram. All faculty and administrators 
became fellows, either through a bid-
ding, process or assignment. At the 
same time, the fellowships took on a 
large ~umber of citizens from New 
Haven to enhance town/gown rela-
tions, and others outside Yale called 
associate fellows. Pierson said, "The 
fellowships have lost some of their in-
timacy, curiosity and good will. 
Numbers change you," Three years 
later the Council of Masters voted to 
abolish the Mandatory Rule. Current-
ly the masters are attempting to cut the 
size of their fellowships to 50 to 60 
from an average total of 162. 

Throughout their existence, "The 
chief value of the fellowships has been 
in gathering a cross-disciplinary group 
of faculty," said Frederick Pottle, Ster- , 
ling Professor Emeritus of English and , 
a fellow of Davenport since 1933. The . 
fellowships also allow faculty of dif-· 
ferent departments to build friend-
ships. Winks said, "It creates an 
awareness of where other fields are go-
ing." He added, "I found what I 
learned through my relationships with 
the fellows the most valuable part of 
Yale. My membership in the fellow-
ship.made me stay here." If one seeks 
tangible benefits, one fmds that many 
a lecture, many an entire course, as 
well as teaching methods, have been 
generated in the interaction of fellows 
of a college. 

Masters plan for their fellowships to 
meet regularly. In most colleges week-
ly or bi-weekly receptions or dinners 
bring fellows together; in colleges such 
as Ezra Stiles and Saybrook, a fellow 
may give a talk to the rest of the 
fellowship after dinner. About once a 
month, Master William Bennett of 
Silliman College invites a visitor from 
outside Yale or sometimes arranges a 
concert for his fellows. Many fellows 
lunch together at the colleges. Henry 
Turner, master of Davenport College, 
uses his fellows to advise on such mat-

Lers as selection of guest-speakers for 
the college. Often a fellow establishes 
the contact with the speaker or group. 

To the extent that fellows participate 
in college life, the fellowships function 
well; however, only about one-quarter 
of all fellows near Yale attend fellows 
gatherings. On the other hand, the 
masters would not have space enough 
if all showed up. 

Many of the fellows themselves are 
not satisfied with the program. Some 
faculty fellows do not feel that the in-
clusion of non-faculty enhances the 
fellowship. Winks explained, however, 
that administrators, staff and faculty 
will operate more successfully if they 
can empathize with each other, as they 
must function side-by-side in the 
university. The addition of non-faculty 
to the fellowships must affect the-pro-
gram's functioning for the faculty and 
the students- the intended benefic-
iaries of the college system. Winks 
predicts that the question of who 
should be a fellow "will come under 
much discussion" as their numbers are 
decreased. 

· 

Yale's size sometimes obstructs 
faculty-student interaction, and the 
fellowships offer an opportunity for ex-
change. The form that ·that e~change 
should take has been the subject of 
discussion since the inception of the 
college system. In 1933 some ad-
ministrators, such as President James 
Rowland Angell and Provost Charles 
Seymour, thought the colleges should 
have a 
definite educational · func-
tion- for example, the fellows might 
take· on tutorial roles, slightly resembl· 
ing the fellows at Oxford. Ultimately 
the fellows did not become tutors 
because the colleges . never became the 
center of teaching at Yale. 

. 

Cutrently a fellow might teach a co1· 
lege seminar, and the college pays him, 
but the college seminar program is not 
solely for the fellows. Fellows also ad· 
vise students in their college formally 
as freshman or departmental advisors. 
On the whole, however, fellow-student 
contact 
is 
informal, 
and rather 
minimal. 

Hope for Interaction 

In a fer' colleges, a strong effort is 
made to bring students and fellows 
together. Some fellows participate in 
college organizations, such as the 
seminar committee, intramural teams 
and language tables in the dining halls. 
Many colleges feature a "Fellowof the 
Week" whom students join for lunch or 
dinner. 

In Berkeley College the program is 
more elaborate: several meals with a 
fellow are scheduled within the week, 
and table 
tents provide a 
3hort 
biography of the fellow. More general-
ly, all Berkeley fellows are listed in a 
directory that notes also their profes-
sional field and hobbies, and they 
stand available to advise students over. 
the telephone. Winks often calls upon 
associate fellows to help seniors find 
jobs. 

In Ezra Stiles College 
on one 
weekend the fellows invite students to 
their homes for dinner. Bennett says he 
tries to arrange for "common ground" 
for fellows and students of Silliman. 
He hosts a "chamber music brunch" in 
his house every other week; students 
and fellows bring their appetites and 
musical abilities. Silliman fellows and 
Fellows at play 
"Students and fellows seem 
mutually terrified of sitting 
down with each other at the 
lunch tables." 
students exhibit their work in the col-
lege's art gallery. They also meet in 
Silliman's darkroom and at dinner par-
ties at the master's house. 

"Find the Fellows" brings Calhoun 
College fellows and students together. 
Three years ago Calhoun obtained 
$12,500 for fellow-student functions in 
a contest for that gift, which had been 
earmarked for improving residential 
college life. Calhoun receives $500 a 
year for 25 years, and the fellows and 
the college council match those funds. 
The committee, led by Kirk Hughes 
'84, sought to use its $1,500 budget to 
promote "meaningful discourse" 
among students and fellows. Hughes' 
ideal is to see close relationships 
evolve: "Everyone needs a mentor," he 
said. 

Like Bennett, he provides common 
ground on which students and fellows 
interact. Several times each term, a 
group of about 15, composed of 
roughly equal numbers of fellows and 
students, attend a play or concert or 
some event that is "entertaining but 
also has pith." 

The program works well, for it 
prompts "dialogue," not merely "con-
tact." Student-faculty discussion is 
"brought down to the vernacular," 
Hughes said, from the lofty, imper-
sonal rhetoric that can characterize 
teacher-student conferences. "Find the 
Fellows" also 
provides lunch at 
j Calhoun and a bottle of wine for a 
..., fellow and student to get" to know one 
~ another further. 

" 

These programs operate well. But 
~e~ they are few. Students, fellows and 
.n 
masters agree that lack of time thwarts 
1; 
the fellowships. Many faculty mem-
..., bers, like Robert Contreras, a Daven-
port fellow, spend their hours not 
given to class work in "research and be-
ing with the family." McLaughlin said, 
«The normal Yale professor is occupied 
with his work, and students are not 
lazy either." As Harold Morowitz, 
master of Pierson College said, "The 
problem is how to get fellows to con-
sider their efforts toward the college as 
significant as those toward their. work." 

Also, in an effort to economiZe, the 
colleges now charge fellows a discount 
rate of 65 per cent to eat in the col-
leges, whereas they formerly h:'"d been 
able to dint> free of charge.
