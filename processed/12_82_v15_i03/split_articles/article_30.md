Dining hall employees have been in 
the kitchen for the past 4-5 minutes. 
They are cooking eggs, blintze!': and 
potato-corn fritters (potatoes and corn 
were both served as vegetables at din-
ner last night). An employee sets out 
bowls of peanut butter. raisins and 
orange marmalade. Another sets out a 
tray of cereals, carefully camouflaging 
the Captain Crunch with tall boxes of 
Cheerios, AU-Bran and Grape-Nuts. 
The Captain Crunch always goes first.

Hart rolls over on his table. "Why do 
we do this to ourselves?" 
"Forty-two," Schwartz says, "the 
answer is forty-two." Everyone agrees. 
This is the show behind every show. 
These are the techies- the technicians, 
electricians, lighting' people, set peo-
ple. They make theatre at Yale hap-
pen, and keep on happening. They 
hang the fresnels, lekos and parcans. 
They put on the bam door, top hats 
and gels. They talk in two-fers and 
three-fers, 25 and 50-foot lengths of 
cable. They know that a "swivel 
cheeseburrow" isn't a ritual Danish 
dance step, and that a wrench isn't just 
for fighting street crime. Techies walk 
in the ceiling supports and hang from 
scaffolding and extension ladders. 
They are late-night acrobats at practice 
whose performances come in colorful 
shapes of light sprayed across the stage 
of another Yale show. 
Mark Schwartz, a Yale graduate 
and a grad student in the Philosophy 
department, has done countless shows 
at Yale.
