ments employ scores of staff members 
whose efforts must be coordinated. At 
the same time, scattered among small 
laboratories and offices are individuals 
whose 
sometimes esoteric projects 
sweep over an incredible variety of in-
tellectual 
and scientific pursuits. 

Diversity, in an atmosphere of free-
dom to pursue the truth, is the essence 
of a great research campus. Yale 
thrives on new programs, special ar-
rangements, unique talents and chance 
discoveries. 

We know that at other universities 
where the staff has succumbed to 
unionization, the netting which holds 
together this conglomeration of ac-
tivities has drawn tight. The critical 
slip-knots in the fabric of the institu-
tion which gives it flexibility to grow, 
change and experiment, have hard-
ened into gnarls. 

Work rules, 
disciplinary proceedings, and time 
clocks have replaced the easy come and 
go. Friendliness has congealed to for-
mality, and mutual interests have 
transmuted to contesting ones. 

The picture just painted is, perhaps, 
overdone. Not every office or labor-
a~ory at Yale is ma.naged with a benign 
hand. And surely, some unions avoid 
the excesses of the notorious. Never-
theless, the whole point of a union is to 
assemble power and to exercise it. In 
contrast, universities simply are not 
put together to match muscle with 
muscle. Professors aren't assembly line 
foremen. Toughness, table-thumping, 
and locked arms are inimical to 
academia. They tear a university 
apart. 

" Some sav that a _s_taff u11ion at Yale 
would be different;-n that it would be 
democratically run; that its leadership 
would be guided solely by the imerests 
of the local members. That is naive. 
The union now seeking to organize 
Yale's staff, like its three predecessors, 
IS bound by its constitution to march to 
t~e tune of the parent "international" 
With which it is affiliated. Of the 
~400,000 or more in dues, fines, initia-
tiOn fees and assessments which Yale 
me~bers would pay each year, ap-
proxtmately $125 000 would be turned

Union: 
"[the workers] 
are less noticed 
and less 
respected than 
the students, the 
faculty and the 
administration." 
John Wilhelm 

The University community is, by its 
nature, concerned with free inquiry, 
with discussion free from pressure and 
propaganda. It is concerned about 
questions of social equity. It is con-
cerned about the importance of all 
members of the community. It is con-
cerned about freedom. It is concerned 
about the right of free association. 

Apparently, however, these sincere-
ly-held concerns and values do not ex-
tend to some members of the Yale 
community. 

Most people in the Yale community 
would be startled to learn that there are 
2,600 clerical and technical employees 
at Yale. 

These employees- overwhelmingly 
women- work in some 256 d ifferent 
job classifications. The work they do is 
critical to the Universi~y's mission. 
Carrying out research, 
handling 
money, processing paperwork, assis-
ting faculty, 
operating computers, 
making the libraries work, providing 
health care, photography, printing-
these and many other vital services rest 
on their shoulders. 

And yet they feel invisible. They are 
less noticed and less respected than the 
students, the faculty, and the ad-
ministration. They are even less no-
ticed than the much smaller group of 
about 1,000 blue-collar service and 
maintenance workers represented by 
Local 35, Federation of University 
Employees, AFL-CIO. 

There are many manifestations of 
the second-class status of clerical and 
technical employees within the Yale 

One, certainly, is- salary. The start-
ing salary in the lowest salary grade is 
$4.24 an hour. The top salary in that 
lowest grade is $5.69 an hour, with no 
system of steady progression from the 
bottom to the top of the salary range. 

Ironically, the comparable lowest 
starting rate at meagerly-endowP.d 
Quinnipiac College, a small school in 
suburban New Haven, is now $4.47, 
23 cents per hour higher than Yale! 

Those employees are members of 
Local 217, 
Hotel & Restaurant 
Et:nRloyees Union, a sister Local to the 
unions at Yale. 

The lowest-paid salary grade for 
Yale service and maintenance workers 
represented by Local 35 starts at $5.47 
an hour and progresses to $6.47 after 
one year's service. Local 35 members 
also get cost-of-living raises every three 
months. 

A senior administrative assistant in 
the clerical and technical group is 
typically found in a highly respon$ible, 
sensitive and demanding job such as 
assisting the Dean of a major Yale 
graduate school. That job is in Salary 
Grade 9, with a starting rate of $6.24 
per hour, or $12,175 per year. The 
maxim um is $9.03 per hour, or 
$17,600 per year, with no assurance 
that an employee will progress to that 
maximum. 

By comparison, a baker represented 
by Local 35 earns $9.38 an hour, or 
$19,150 a year, after one year's ser-
vice. A first cook or a carpenter earns 
$10.07 an hour, or $20,946 a year, 
after one year's service. 

A key national issue today is "com-
parable worth": the long-overdue idea 
that jobs should be paid according to 
the worth of the work performed, and 
not be paid less just because most of 
those involved are women, or more 
just because they are men. Yale would 
make an excellent laboratory for study-
ing that concept, as the comparisons 
above suggest. 

The lack of respect for clerical and 
technical employees at Yale 
is, 
however, much more deep-seated than 
the salary issue, important as that is. 

Example: Present clerical and technical 
employees are not given any pref-
erence when there is a job opening.

**The Unionization of Yale's Staff**
**Page number(s): 8**

University · 
"The range 
of benefits ... 
is extraordinary." 
pay for that body's programs and ad-
ministration. Just as unions exist to 
wield power externally, so are they 
governed by·power internally. 

Suppose Yale's clerical and technical 
staff members do decide to form a 
union. What effect will students see? 
There is no short answer to that, but 
here again, examples drawn from 
other universities suggest what is most 
likely to touch students lives. Almost 
certainly, a union will move to restrict 
student access to campus jobs. Where 
there is now flexibility in the student 
employment picture, a union contract 
will impose boundaries. That has been 
Yale's experience with its blue collar 
union. 

If a Yale union behaves as other 
union s do, its leaders, in order to stay 
in office, will have to bargain on behalf 
of their members for an ever-increas-
ing slice of the dollar pie. If Yale does 
not grow, then someone will have to 
pay in more dollars to make a bigger 
pie, or some group activity will have to 
take a smaller slice .. There always has 
been, and there always will be, a con-
test for the University's resources. 
That contest will become livelier, to 
say the least. 

Another eflect, and perhaps the 
most unwelcome one, may come about 
because of the difficulty unions have 
always had in dealing with the concept 
o f merit. Most unionized workers (and 
all in the union nQw at Yale) who hold 
the same jobs get exactly the same pay 
after an initial probationary period. 
Merit is not reflected in pay checks. 
The least effective worker who meets 
th e minimum standards gets precisely 
the same pay as the strongest con-
tributor. Students who have dealt with 
a government office or a motor vehicles 
bureau will appreciate what happens to 
service when there are no incentives to 
try harder or to work smarter. Unions 
cannot recognize merit. Yale cannot 
ignore it. The entire campus would 
feel the conflict. 

If Yale's administration feels as 
strongly as it does about having a 
union-free staff, what has it done and 
what will it do to respond to the 
legitimate concerns of those employees 
who think they need a union to repre-
sent then1? Three primary issues must 
be addressed. 

J ob security is on everyone's mind. 
H appily Yale has a healthy record in 
this area. Our educational "product" 
continues to enjoy a strong demand 
and there is little chance that we will go 
out of business. We won't close the 
New H aven plant. We won't move to 
Sumter, South Carolina. We have 
been able in the past and we expect in 
the future to manage most staffing 
changes through natural attrition. 

Second, we must constantly see to 
the business of fair compensation-
compensation being the total of salaries 
and benefits. Up until a few.years ago 
Yale had reputation for leading the 
parade on 
benefits while 
lagging 
behind .on pay, not so much for 
employees who had been here for a few 
years, but rather in starting salaries for 
newcomers. We have made major 
strides in altering this picture. In each 
of the last four years the average salary 
increase for continuing clerical and 
technical staff members has exceeded 
10 percent. As a result of a salary scale 
improvement which will go into effect 
on December 1, Yale will have raised 
its starting salaries in 
its largest 
classifications by 60 percent in less 
than four and a half years. These are 
big changes, and as a result we have 
largely achieved our objective of offer-
ing fully competitive salaries in the 
market from which we draw our 
employees. 

With respect to benefits, Yale has 
maintained a leadership position by 
adding new programs, expanding ex-
isting ones, and increasing their dollar 
value. The range of benefits available 
to staff is extraordinary. It includes a 
choice of four health insurance plans 
and two major medical plans at very 
low cost; 22 paid vacation days plus six 
paid recess days, four paid personal 
days and seven paid holidays each 
year; bonus vacation days for long-
service; low-cost life insurance up to 
four times salary; J 2 paid sick days per 
year with the ability to accumulate up 
to 120 unused days for later need; free 
life 
and accident insurance for 
University-related travel; up to $250 
per term in tuition assistance for 
college-level courses; half tuition in 
Yale's Special Studies courses; college 
scholarships of up to $3,500 per year 
for children of long-service employees; 
free long-term disability insurance 
which picks up where social security 
leaves off; an excellent pension plan 
entirely paid for by the University; a 
mortgage assistance program; and a 
large array of plans through which 
employees can save or accumulate 
capital with substantial tax benefits. I 
know of no employer in this area that 
matches Yale in overall benefit pro-
grams. 

Finally, there is fair treatment, the 
area where we must always work the 
hardest. Because people are human, 
make mistakes and m isunderstand one 
another, small problems can become 
big hassles. Sometimes people of ex-
traordinary genius are less sensitive 
than they should be to the needs of 
their fellow workers. One or'the major 
responsibilities of Yale's 
Personnel 
Department is to try to catch "people" 
problems early and to assist in their 
resolution. When solutions are not 
forthcoming, Yale staff members may 
avail themselves of a formal Grievance 
Procedure which really works. The 
Training Department offers a wide 
variety of courses to employees to help 
them become better supervisors, to 
show them how to deal with conflict, to 
help them manage their own careers, 
and to keep them abreast of Yale's 
policies and work rules. There can and 
will be no let-up in these efforts to 
maintain fair treatment. 

It is true in every field of endeavor 
that the better one gets at defining 
one's ideals, the harder their achieve-
ment seems to become. But setting 
goals and then finding ways to meet 
them is the cru cial task of every ad-
ministration. The conviction that Yale 
must be a good place to work is not 
limited. For in the end, all of us, 
whether we study, teach, conduct 
research or mind the store, will be bet-
ter off if our community is one where 
people work together on a voluntary 
basis in an atmosphere of cooperation 
and mutual respect.
