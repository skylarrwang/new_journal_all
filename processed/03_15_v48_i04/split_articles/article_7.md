O
ne plowed road cuts through the center of John­
sonville, Connecticut, and snow is piled high on 
either side. Beyond the road’s ragged edges, about 
twenty Victorian houses stand empty. They’re scattered 
in this plot of land as if airdropped, randomly spaced 
and facing different directions, like pigeons that land­
ed in a snow bank. The paint on their walls is chipped 
and fading, save for a few remaining patches of jaunty 
red or turquoise. Some of their windows are broken 
but many are intact. One has a suitcase wedged into 
its frame. There are security cameras on every door. 
For many months, this village was for sale. It was 
on the market from spring 2013 until late last Octo­
ber, when all sixty-two acres of it went up for auction 
at the starting price of $800,000. Considering it is 
part of the town of East Haddam, where single-family 
dwellings that are not historic Victorian homesteads 
regularly sell for over $300,000, this asking price was 
almost desperately low. The auction closed on Hal­
loween and the property sold for $1.9 million to an 
undisclosed buyer. 

Johnsonville’s glory days have come and gone, a 
few times. From around 1850 to 1930 it was a pros­
perous milling community on the Moodus River. It 
was home to the Neptune Twine and Cord Company, 
owned by the village’s namesake, Emory Johnson. It 
was never much more than a company town—the 
mill, the mill office, the mill owner’s homestead, 
and a few workers’ cottages—but it did well enough. 
Johnson had the money to carve nice Victorian details 
into his wraparound porch. The century moved on, 
though, and as local manufacturing faded, the town 
went into decline.

Then, in the 1960s, local aerospace millionaire 
Raymond Schmitt acquired the town piece by piece—
starting with the mill—and turned Johnsonville into 
a Victorian-themed tourist attraction. He brought in 
period-appropriate structures from other Connecticut 
towns, including a chapel, a stable, and a steamboat. 
He refurbished all the buildings and stuffed them 
with antiques.

“That was the town’s real heyday,” says Luke 
Boyd, the creator of a website dedicated to Johnson­
ville. But it didn’t last. “East Haddam hated him. Here 
comes this carpetbagger guy, rich off the military-in­
dustrial complex, and he’s trying to bring tourists into 
this village.”

Schmitt got into a zoning dispute with the town 
and closed the attraction in 1990. He died in 1998, 
and the hotel management company, MJ ABC, bought 
the property in 2001. They tried to turn it into a 
55-and-over community with a health club and spa 
retreat before the 2008 
recession foiled their 
plans. Now it’s a ghost 
town, though it has al­
ways been a town in 
suspension—inhabited 
and declining, alive but 
only on display, owned 
and unoccupied, sold 
and abandoned.

During a blizzarding 
Saturday afternoon, two 
friends and I drove up to 
Johnsonville. The village came into view as we drove 
down Johnsonville Road. First came the Old Gilead 
Chapel, the small Victorian church that Raymond 
Schmitt bought from the town of Waterford, Connect­
icut, meticulously disassembled, transported to John­
sonville, and put back together. Its door shone bright 
blue. Then there was the Emory Johnson Homestead, 
its ornamented porch now peeling and neglected. 
Signs on doors and windows of every building around 
warned “NO TRESPASSING” and “PRIVATE PROPER­
TY.” But there was no graffiti, and the doors hadn’t 
been kicked in. Some light bulbs were on in front of 
the stable, a flickering reminder that anarchy doesn’t 
rule yet in Johnsonville. Boyd says there’s a caretaker 
who comes by from time to time, but he doesn’t live 
on the site. 

We parked in an empty lot and walked around. 
We threw up our hoods and tried to avoid the ancient-
looking security cameras, wading through a foot of 
snow to approach the buildings. It was sweet and a 
little sad to look at the loopy footprints we left around 
them, signatures in the snow, like some indiscreet tres­
passers had signed the guest book of the abandoned 
village. Looking in the windows, we saw the typical 
relics of incomplete decay—some mossy books, piles 
of wallpaper, woodchips, dented beer cans. Pity all the 
antiques had been auctioned off. Outside, it was damp 
and quiet, save for the occasional car sputtering by. 
And there was always the muted thudding of the river 
dam behind the homestead. 

The boom-bust cycle isn’t anything new for small 
communities reliant on a single local industry. But 
Johnsonville, which seemed to die a natural death 
when the mill closed, was resurrected unnaturally—
a Frankenstein patched together with other villages’ 
buildings. With the mill gone, its survival can only 
depend on tourism: the 
way it looks, and the fact 
that it’s there. And for 
now it seems it will be 
there until it crumbles 
completely. According to 
the real estate agency that 
handles the property, the 
undisclosed buyer has 
backed out. 

There’s a neatly sym­
bolic picture of Johnson­
ville that’s easy to find on 
the Internet. It’s of a short, weather-worn gate bearing 
a sign that says “Village Closed to Public.” We found 
this sign in front of a small cottage facing the road. 
Approaching the house, I noticed a Christmas tree 
through one of the windows, draped in illuminated 
white lights. Closer still, I saw that the inside of the 
house was fully furnished, with a runner on the ta­
ble and little doilies on the armchairs. We even heard 
music wafting from the back. Excited, we knocked 
on the front door, and when no one answered, we 
tapped on all of the windows. We walked all around 
the perimeter of the house, trying to catch a glimpse 
of someone. Vandal deterrent, caretaker’s secret home, 
domestic ghost residence—it’s not disclosed. No one 
in in the empty village came to tell us.
