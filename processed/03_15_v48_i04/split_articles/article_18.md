T
he yarn hung in purple skeins from the ceilings 
of small tents. It was wrapped into rainbow spi­
rals inside plastic boxes, and interwoven with bright 
green feathers and small iridescent sequins. Yarn 
stared up at me from book covers, from brochures, 
from multicolored quilts stretched over tables, and 
from the hands of women clicking knitting needles.
On a Saturday in October, I was at Stitches East, 
an annual “fiber experience” for knitters, crocheters, 
spinners, and dyers. The three-day-long event boasted 
a marketplace, a fashion show, and a full schedule of 
technique classes. The Hartford Convention Center 
was quiet, save for the mechanical whir of yarn swifts 
turning their wooden arms in quick circles. Booths 
were strung with Christmas lights and decorated with 
framed photos of alpacas. The crowd was what I ex­
pected: largely middle-aged, white, and female. Some 
wore floor-length Renaissance dresses or skirts deco­
rated with cherries.


But I was there in search of “yarn bombers”: 
craftivists who display their knitting in public spac­
es in support of certain social and political goals. I 
learned to knit and cross-stitch at an elementary 
school where none of the work was graded and teach­
ers went by their first names. Crafting was an oppor­
tunity for creative expression, not an exercise in thrift. 
But as Joanne Turney writes in The Culture of Knitting, 
knitting has a history as a “subversive, even devious 
activity.” It has been used as a tool for environmental­
ism, Marxism, and feminism. Knitting can reclaim a 
largely anonymized, mechanized, labor-divided pro­
cess of production, and revalue objects based on the 
time and skill spent creating them.


During the summer of 2014, I walked across a 
bridge over Boston’s Charles River, running my hand 
over the knit-covered handrail between the city and 
Cambridge. The yarn art was created in part in an ef­
fort to connect different communities after the Boston 
Marathon bombings. But such public acts of knitting 
can be even more radical. In 2012, a group called 
Government Free VJJ organized a campaign to send 
knit vaginas and uteri to Republican congressmen 
who had drafted laws restricting women’s reproduc­
tive rights. My imagination of the people who knit-
bombed grew wild. I began to picture them as D.I.Y 
grrrls in Doc Martens and pixie cuts. Maybe, in com­
munities close to my own, I would find the subversive 
“craftivists” that Turney describes. Armed with an en­
cyclopedia of third-wave feminism and a pair of old 
knitting needles, I went looking for knitting circles in 
New Haven—and nearby—that were unraveling the 
patriarchy, one stitch at a time. 


At Stitches East, however, hot-blooded radicals 
were hard to find. I spotted a woman holding a tiny 
green plastic ring in her hands, sewing a lace flower. 
She told me her name was Jacqueline Chalmers, and 
we chatted about what she called “fiberholics” in the 
“fiber community.” When she said she was part of a 
Stitch ’n’ Bitch group, she tripped a little over the 
“bitch” part. (Stitch ’n’ Bitch is a movement created 
by Debbie Stoller, who got a doctorate in psychology 
from Yale, and who has authored a series of pattern 
books with modern projects that appeal to a young­
er audience. Groups of knitters and crocheters who 
gather in coffee shops or yarn stores to knit together 
often refer to the event as “Stitch ’n’ Bitch.”)


I questioned whether my preconceptions of radi­
cal knitters’ appearances were accurate, even though 
she was not wearing, say, an eyebrow ring or leath­
er jacket. So I asked her if she’d ever yarn bombed. 
Chalmers told me that she and her knitting group 
sometimes draped blankets over benches in Bing­
hamton, New York, partially as street art and partially 
as an anonymous donation to the homeless. Another 
attendee, Sara Bixler, a weaver with red and purple 
glasses, told me about a recent yarn bomb she con­
tributed to outside of a Quaker retreat center in Penn­
sylvania. The purpose was to express solidarity with 
local gay and transgender communities.


Guerilla knitting traces its roots to early 2005, 
when, on a whim, Texas-based yarn shop owner Mag­
da Sayeg knitted a cozy for her shop’s door handle. 
Sayeg formed a group called the Nitta Crew, whose 
mission, according to an anonymous member known 


as AKrylik, is to make street art a little more warm 
and fuzzy. Sayeg’s project inspired knitters across 
the world to cover their own surroundings with 
knit “sweaters,” sometimes for beautification, other 
times with more strident goals. Along with her cus­
tomers, Linda Reis, the owner of Knit New Haven, 
yarn bombs New Haven’s Whitney Avenue each year. 
Thick mauve yarn wraps around thin gold string on 
a row of street signs and trees. Between two park­
ing meters, she has stitched a red-and-white heart. 
Trina Machesney, another local knitter, told me the 
“sweater” she placed on a friend’s tree as a birth­
day present was probably the first-ever yarn bomb 
in the Westville neighborhood. She claims the craft 
of knitting is undergoing a modern revival, espe­
cially among American families who had forgotten 
the art. 


I wanted to learn more 
about the importance of knit­
ting for community building, 
so I called Gale Zucker, the 
Connecticut-based 
co-author 
of Craft Activism: People, Ideas, 
and Projects from the New 
Community 
of 
Handmade 
and How You Can Join In. Yarn 
bombing can make a statement 
in a “passive political way,” 
she explained.


She told me about an event 
she organized in Little Rock, Ar­
kansas, at a public library. “It’s 
an urban library, right in the 
center of Little Rock, and we 
started making little things out 
of old stuff that people brought, 
old buttons and threads. We 
went outside and yarn bombed 
all the trees and poles and peo­
ple joined in, in the middle of the city.” It was one of 
her favorite yarn bombing projects. “For those two 
hours, you had a really amazing community effort 
going on.” Zucker’s language sometimes seemed too 
optimistic, and she was quick to dismiss claims that 
craftivism might be largely the hobby of the white 
middle class. Her project did seem valuable, though, 
in that it temporarily drew different demographics of 
the city into the same public space.


Another Westville knitter, Stephanie Maples, con­
ducted a similar project in her own neighborhood. For 
the past few years, she has coordinated yarn bombs in 
conjunction with the neighborhood’s annual Art Walk. 
As we sat in Manjares, a coffee shop with a view of 
Edgewood Park and a few yarn-bombed bike racks, 
Maples described the people who would approach 
her as she yarn bombed. They would reminisce 
about how their grandmothers used to knit and how 
they thought it was great she was reviving the prac­
tice. While we talked, she ran into a few people she 
knew, talking and laughing as she stood by their table. 
It’s easy to imagine her orchestrating a yarn bomb: 
gathering together women—the yarn-bombers who 
have participated in Art Walk were all women—and 
showing them how to patch together an eight-foot-
long scarf from the dozens of squares they have 
knitted together.  


The more women I spoke 
with, the more I began to 
question the idea that knitting 
circles were bastions of politi­
cal action. The knitters I spoke 
to did not consider themselves 
icons of larger movements. “I 
don’t really attach it to anything 
besides personally what I want 
to do,” Maples told me. This 
attitude could be a product of 
the second-wave feminism they 
grew up with: as Turney notes, 
in 1970s and 1980s feminist 
discourse, knitting was seen “as 
an act of compliance and sub­
missiveness, and was derided.” 
In third-wave feminism and 
beyond, the craft was embraced 
as a way of reclaiming tradi­
tionally “feminine” activities in 
new ways


But even if the knitters did not see themselves as 
third-wave feminists, under Zucker’s broad definition 
(“Using craft for a reason beyond the simple making 
of the thing and working of the materials”) the West­
ville yarn bombers I met were craftivists on a very lo­
cal scale. Machesney spoke about reclaiming the pro­
cess of making a product from start to finish, inching 
towards the Marxist theories of knitting that Turney 
discusses in her book. Even when these women are 
not consciously aligning themselves with any particu­
lar movement, their work is a form of political expres­
sion.
