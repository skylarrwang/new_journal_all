scale of a professorship, he wasn’t certain exactly what 
form he wanted the gift to take. He did know that 
he wanted his donation to provide something unique 
and valuable for the university.

“Having thirty-three professors in the econom­
ics department instead of thirty-two didn’t seem 
like it would move the needle very much for Yale,” 
Rosenkranz said.

Rosenkranz liked Schmidt’s suggestion of endow­
ing Yale’s first writer-in-residence program, since he 
knew that students got a “certain thrill” from prox­
imity to famous writers. That “thrill” was even more 
than simply being taught by a great educator.

“No matter how distinguished the professors are, 
there’s a star quality that attracts students,” Rosen­
kranz said. His first “star” was Ved Mehta, a blind, 
Indian-born author and New 
Yorker contributor, who served 
as Yale’s first Rosenkranz Writ­
er-in-Residence from 1990 to 
1994. In 2004, Dean Richard 
Brodhead appointed poet Lou­
ise Glück as Rosenkranz Writ­
er-in-Residence, the same year 
Fadiman joined the faculty.

Francis’s 
undergraduate 
experience was marked by the 
mentorship of Branford Mas­
ter and writing teacher William 
Zinsser, the author of the classic 
guide On Writing Well. Fran­
cis noted that his undergradu­
ate study of writing at Yale had 
been a “tremendous asset” in 
his career. So in 2003, Francis 
approached Yale College Dean 
Richard Brodhead with the intention of endowing a 
“pastoral” writer-in-residence—someone who would 
provide advice and guidance to talented students, 
just as Zinsser had. There would be funds set aside 
for “Francis Conversations”—readings with promi­
nent writers. Most importantly, the Francis Writer-
in-Resident would engage with students beyond the 
classroom. One way Francis has encouraged this is 
through reunion dinners with former students, like 
the dinner I attended last fall at Mory’s.

Rosenkranz had not initially intended to limit 
his writer-in-residence program to writers of fiction 
and poetry, and would have been “perfectly happy” to 
sponsors of Yale’s Writer-in-Residence programs. 
Francis happens to be friends with Robert Rosen­
kranz ’62, sponsor of the Rosenkranz Writer-in-Resi­
dence program. The two met many years ago by “total 
coincidence,” through the board of New York Uuni­
versity Law School.

Rosenkranz is the CEO of Delphi Financial Group, 
while Francis has worked in both the private and the 
public sector, serving as the CFO of Ann Taylor Stores 
Corporation and Priceline.com, and in high-level ad­
ministrative positions under New York Governors El­
iot Spitzer, David Paterson, and Andrew Cuomo. 
Rosenkranz described his philanthropic vision 
as “venture philanthropy,” approaching Yale with the 
financial means to enact “less obvious” educational 
initiatives. Rosenkranz’s gifts have enabled the Uni­
versity to develop new science 
and 
quantitative 
reasoning 
courses, construct Rosenkranz 
Hall, and develop its online 
learning platform.

Ultimately, 
he 
praised 
a 
system 
in 
which 
pri­
vate 
institutions 
like 
Yale 
venture 
philanthropists 
work together.

“Private funding makes for 
a more competitive environ­
ment, where schools have to 
compete for funding, faculty, 
students, and reputation, and 
that fosters free-market com­
petition, which makes things 
great here,” he said. 

Both men were drawn to 
donate to Yale out of a sense of 
allegiance to the University. Rosenkranz graduated 
summa cum laude at the age of 19, as the youngest 
member of Yale’s class of 1962, and recalls how the 
college helped him “cobble together” tuition from 
loans, scholarships, and student jobs.

“I just feel such affection for the place,” Rosen­
kranz said. “It was the first time that I’d succeeded 
in what I thought was a big pond and it gave me the 
confidence to think I could do something major with 
my life.”

In 1990, when Rosenkranz first approached Yale’s 
then-President Benno Schmidt with a $1 million gift 
and the intention of establishing something on the 

“PRIVATE FUNDING 
MAKES FOR A 
MORE COMPETITIVE 
ENVIRONMENT, WHERE 
SCHOOLS HAVE TO 
COMPETE FOR FUNDING, 
FACULTY, STUDENTS, 
AND REPUTATION, AND 
THAT FOSTERS FREE-
MARKET COMPETITION, 
WHICH MAKES THINGS 
GREAT HERE.”
