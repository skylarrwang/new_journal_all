New Haven’s director of economic development. “Our 
first question when something is empty is: ‘What are the 
steps necessary for getting it back to life?’” he said. 
Mahler, who also works as a concert promoter, con­
vinced Elissa Getto to move to New Haven from Stam­
ford to direct the NHCPA. The nonprofit’s director since 
last May, she has experience at the helm of struggling 
arts organizations: her previous position had been at the 
Stamford Center for Performing Arts, which she had 
helped rescue from bankruptcy. 
The city chose not to allot any funds for the project. 
Instead, Mahler made a significant private investment 
and will be the theatre’s promoter. He is working with 
the NHCPA to run the project. 
“It is unusual for theatres to undergo drastic change 
without city or state funding,” said Getto, but her team is 
determined to pull it off by taking a new approach. “Just 
because we are a nonprofit doesn’t mean we don’t act 
like a business,” she explains. The College Street Music 
Hall project is part of a new trend in of urban devel­
opment: collaboration between nonprofit organizations 
and private companies. Aside from the Capitol Theatre in 
Port Chester, New York, the College Street Music Hall is 
the only regional concert venue developed in this kind 
of partnership. 
With 2,000 seats, the College Street Music Hall is 
already attracting the talent it needs. On May 1, The Ma­
chine will perform the music of Pink Floyd along with 
the Hartford Symphony Orchestra. A ten-day film festi­
val is in the works, as is a “Count Up to 400” extrava­
ganza—the first annual celebration anticipating the city’s 
four-hundredth birthday in 2038, which will include a 
number of concerts. 
The hope is that the shows that are planned for the 
College Street Music Hall will attract Elm City locals, 
suburbanites, and students from the University of New 
Haven, Yale, and Gateway Community College. With 
plans underway to find a replacement for the recently 
closed Anchor Bar, and a renovation scheduled for the 
Schubert, College Street is decidedly in the midst of a 
makeover, even if the comparison to Times Square might 
seem ambitious.
“Ever since the original nine-square grid, New Hav­
en has been a city designed for culture,” said Wolf. If you 
ask him if the new College Street is focused on restoring 
faded glory, he will correct you: “Not restoring history, 
reimagining history.”
