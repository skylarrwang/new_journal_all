he funeral was supposed to 
begin at 7:30 p.m., but the 
mourners didn’t show up until 
closer to 8. They came dressed all 
in black except for their sneakers. 
None of them had been to this 
kind of funeral before, and they 
were nervous. “I haven’t memo­

named Bianca told me. The pro­

beside the tables, amid the din of 
clinking cutlery and conversation 
snatched between bites. They had 
no intention of eating. Quite the 
opposite: their mission was to eu­
logize the food. 

The funeral was organized by 
Direct Action Everywhere—DXE, 
as it is known—a newly formed 
animal rights network. While DXE 
opposes all animal cruelty, the pri­
mary target of its campaigns is the 
production and consumption of 
meat. It considers eating animals 
to be a serious act of violence. To 
get their point across, its mem­
