bers stage “actions” in restaurants, 
shouting at the patrons, reminding 
them that they are eating corpses.  
For many, the image of animal 
rights activism involves wide-eyed 
ladies leafleting on the sidewalk. 
As Groff puts it, “Animal rights is 
a white country club activity, has 
been up until this point.” DXE’s 
leaders want to take the movement 
out of the hands of fuddy-duddies 
and give it a twenty-first century 
makeover. The network prides it­
self on its diversity: Groff points 
out that the national founders of 
DXE are Chinese American, Indian 
American, Chicano. Full of words 
like “normativity” and “intersec­
tionality,” their rhetoric has a cer­
tain intellectual hipness, and it is 
beginning to catch on. A year ago, 
Groff says, DXE consisted of eight 
people in San Francisco; now the 
group has approximately eighty 
chapters in twenty countries.


The community theater as­
pect of the funeral—replete with 
props, costumes, and lines to
—is not incidental to the move­
ment’s growth. The primary aim 
of DXE’s actions is not to convince 
enthusiastic steak eaters to give 
up meat. Instead, it is to forge a 
strong network of activists. Each 
action is the radical vegan equiva­
lent of an ice cream social: a way 
for the community, which does 
a lot of its organizing online, 
to meet in person and become 
friends. The public performance 
is meant to band vegans togeth­
er, to strengthen their resolve 
and prevent them from return­
ing to the vegetarian—or worse, 
omnivorous—fold. 


What makes for good bond­
ing can make for bizarre pro­
tests. At the funeral on October 
30, the mourners on the Green 
couldn’t decide how confronta­
tional they wanted to be. They 
would be shouting at restaurant-
goers, but they weren’t going to 
cause any harm. They wanted to 
be noticed, but they did not want 
to be arrested. When they walked 
to Groff’s Honda to get the cof­
fin—a four-foot-long box made 
of obsolete election signs that 
Groff had spray-painted black—
one of the pallbearers spoke up: 
“One note about the coffin. Could 
this be mistaken for some kind of 
explosive device?” 


Groff stopped in the middle of 
handing out fake flowers. “Good 
question,” he said. He stuck his 
nose into a purple bloom, think­
ing hard. “Good question,” he 
said again.


New Haven’s restaurant scene 
is nothing out of the or­
dinary: noodle shops, fast-food 
joints, and pizzerias alongside a 
smattering of more upscale, pro­
fessorial places. To the organizers 
of DXE, though, the banality with 
which we view these restaurants is 
a sign of our desensitization. The 
animals that will become meat are 
not slaughtered on-site, but in the 
activists’ eyes, the restaurants that 
cook and serve cows and chickens 
and pigs are nothing less than insti­
tutional accomplices to murder. The 
group’s language is unequivocal. As 
Zach Groff wrote to me in an email 
before the funeral procession, Chi­
potle and Buffalo Wild Wings are 
“places of violence.”


What the rest of us think of 
as animals, DXE refers to as “non-
human animals” and as “our breth­
ren.” In their literature, animals are 
assigned names and genders, per­
sonalities and biographies. When 
I asked one of the pallbearers in 
Connecticut why she gave up some 
of her favorite foods, such as pizza 
and ice cream, even though their 
creation didn’t entail any slaugh­
ter, her answer was very personal: 
“I wouldn’t want anyone to do that 
to me: forcibly impregnate me, take 
my babies away, and take my milk. 
I would feel extremely violated 
by that.”


When it comes to the capac­
ity to feel pain and joy and love, 


animals are no different from hu­
mans, according to DXE. Groff 
is convinced that animal rights 
can become the next progres­
sive movement, following in the 
tradition of civil rights and gay 
rights. Organizations like ACT UP 
used violent imagery and street art 
and disruptive actions to draw the 
world’s attention to the AIDS cri­
sis. Now, DXE wants to use those 
same tactics to draw attention to 
the horrors of the meat industry.


If the members of Connecticut 
DXE had been nervous before the 
funeral, it was nothing compared 
to what I felt. At about 6:45 p.m., 
I had gone into a state of frenzy. 
Nearly everything I was wearing 
was the product of either murder 
or theft. My sweaters were made 
of wool ripped from the bodies of 
poor bleating sheep. The sounds of 
pain involved in the production of 
my leather shoes are simply un­
printable. My subjects would take 
one look at me and know imme­
diately that I was a criminal. And 
who wants to give good quotes to 
a murderer? 


I borrowed a non-leather belt 
from a friend. It didn’t keep my 
pants up, but I figured that ex­
posing my rear end was better 
than exposing myself as an en­
emy to the cause. My only non-
leather shoes looked like they had 
emerged from the nightmares of 
Coco Chanel: fluorescent white-
and-blue jogging sneakers made 
of synthetic mesh. I slipped them 
on and laced them up. I didn’t have 
time to find a non-wool sweater, so 
I made a mental note not to unzip 
my jacket. I grabbed my notebook, 
and headed out for my first assign­
ment undercover. 


As I walked to meet the ac­
tivists, I had an uncomfortable 
realization. The funeral would be 
filmed and posted on YouTube. 
And even if no one I knew clicked 
on the videos, I would be traips­
ing around downtown New Ha­
ven in a procession that aimed to 
commemorate the lives and per­
sonalities of those creatures who’d 
been turned into meat—creatures 
that under almost any other cir­
cumstances, I would be happy to 
ingest. I might not have been a 
mourner myself, but in my black 
coat I sure looked like one.


Our first target was Buffalo 
Wild Wings. There were about 
fourteen of us, and as we walked in, 
a hostess in a bright yellow sports 
jersey said, “Hi, guys, welcome!” 
and flashed her most professional 
hostess smile. She didn’t seem to 
notice our somber faces, our fune­
real black, our signs, our flowers, 
or our coffin. We stood between 
tables, under huge TVs that yam­
mered with the sounds of foot­
ball games. Allan Brison, a former 
New Haven alder—whose beard 
and shining eyes make him look 
like DXE Connecticut’s resident 
druid—started off the proceedings 
by gesturing at the coffin. “Behind 
us is the body of someone, some­
one who was never named,” he 
intoned, “who only wanted safety 
and love, but only knew suffering 
and violence.” His voice quavered, 
barely audible over the music and 
the sports games. Still, the restau­
rant’s manager appeared almost 
immediately, touching Brison on 
the elbow and whispering in his 
ear. Brison headed for the door. 
As planned, Groff began to shout, 
with the rest of the mourners re­
sponding in unison. 


“Their bodies!” 
“Not ours!”
“Their milk!”
“Their lives!


As Groff himself made his 
way to the door, one of the diners 
shouted after him, “They’re deli­
cious,” and began to snicker. 
“You 
laugh, 
they 
die,” 
Groff said. 


Out on the sidewalk, every­
one agreed that as actions go, the 
one they had just staged was weak. 
Everything needed to be louder,


the speakers more sure of them­
selves. Groff would take over the 
opening speech—his booming 
baritone would carry better than 
Brison’s voice. 


The next stop was Chipotle. In 
DXE’s view, Chipotle is the worst 
of the worst, the most cunning 
of enemies. The irony is that Chi­
potle’s website is not so different 
from DXE’s. Both disparage factory 
farms, and both claim to be fixing 
the problem. The burrito chain’s 
solution is to source meat differ­
ently. According to their website, 
one hundred percent of their pork 
comes from pigs “raised outside, 
or in deeply bedded pens,” where 
they can wander and dig with their 
snouts, with no antibiotics and a 
vegetarian diet. Other pages claim 
that the company has been success­
ful in promoting “naturally raised” 
cattle, and it chooses poultry farm­
ers who go beyond the FDA re­
quirements. Their menu even has 
vegan options.


But DXE activists say that Chi­
potle’s website is full of lies—
“humane-washing,” 
in 
Groff’s 
words—and that its revenue is 
“blood money.” They see Chipo­
tle’s attempt to provide “naturally 
raised” meat as yet another in­
stance of the corporate machine 
masking its misdeeds in order to 
turn a profit, like a fossil fuel exec­
utive teaching schoolchildren how 
to recycle. 


Tonight, New Haven’s Chipo­
tle had a surprise on the menu: a 
funeral. It was just as short lived 
as the funeral had been in Buffalo 
Wild Wings, but Chipotle fran­
chises have an antiseptic design, 
and the bright lights and quieter 
music made the activists more no­
ticeable. As Groff began to chant, 
patrons pulled out iPhones and
