EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The Schaghticoke tribe is praying for the 
long-lost bones of its ancestors. Standing 
on the Connecticut reservation their fami­
lies once called home, members clasp one 
another’s cold hands. They turn their backs 
on the neighboring town of Kent and on the 
massive vans parked like sleeping giants 
on the other end of the plateau. They wait 
outside the wooden fence of the reserva­
tion’s small cemetery, bordered by spindly 
birch trees and the Housatonic River. It is 
early November, and they have gathered 
from across the state to clear away the 
autumn’s fallen leaves and to pay their re­
spects to the departed.


“We are putting our ancestors back in the ground, 
where they should be, and back on the reservation,” 
says Ed Sarabia, a member of another Native American 
tribe who has come to officiate the ceremony. Dressed 
in a plaid shirt and jeans, he crosses the circle to pick 
up a can of American Spirit tobacco and a blue, gun-
shaped lighter. He tells those present to forget about 
their unfinished work and their unpaid bills for the 
moment. As part of the purification ritual, called a 
“smudge,” he raises a flame to a braid of dried sweet 
grass and recites a blessing. Two other tribal mem­
bers make their way around the circle in silence, trac­
ing a ring around each participant with the burning 
braid. It dips from head to shins, and then rises again, 
smoking faintly.  
As they enter the cemetery, each participant 
pinches tobacco from the large can and scatters it 
in the freshly dug hole in the corner of the burial 
ground. Beside it sits a shallow, white box filled with 
bones. Nick Bellantoni, the former state archaeologist 
who brought the bones to the reservation today, de­
clares that they are, without a doubt, of Native Ameri­


American origin. Several years ago, archeologists unearthed 
the seventeenth-century bone fragments in Fort Hill, 
outside of New Milford. Though the bones may have 
come from one of the related tribes that lived in the 
area centuries ago, Sarabia takes the opportunity to 
focus on the spiritual Creator. It is a time to celebrate 
commonality, rather than difference. 
For the Schaghticoke, returning to the land is a 
fraught subject, and proving ancestry is even more 
contentious. Though Connecticut has recognized their 
tribe since 1736, they have spent the last few decades 
trying to get the U.S. Department of the Interior to 
make the same determination. Joining the roster of 
566 federally acknowledged tribes would come with 
far-ranging benefits. It would give the tribe the sta­
tus of a sovereign nation, and guarantee its mem­
bers funding and services for education, healthcare, 
housing, law enforcement, and resource protection 
through the DOI’s Bureau of Indian Affairs. It would 
also help the Schaghticoke reclaim much of their res­
ervation land. According to the tribe, the approxi­
mately 2,500-acre reservation has shrunk to four 
hundred acres, since state-appointed overseers sold 
off much of the land to cover Schaghticoke debts. But 
the land claims stand little chance in court without 
federal recognition. 
In order to gain United States’ stamp of approv­
al, the tribe must demonstrate that it has been a dis­
tinct community governed by a political authority 
since what the Bureau of Indian Affairs calls “historic 
times,” starting as early as 1789. Despite the work 
of researchers, anthropologists, genealogists, and 
attorneys, corroborating the tribe’s continuous ex­
istence has been a costly, decades-long process. The 
tribe’s massive collection of court files, meeting re­
cords, land sales, marriage certificates, and other doc­
umentation has helped it almost reach its goal, but 
according to the DOI, significant gaps remain in the 
historical record. 
For a brief, promising moment in 2004, the 
U.S. government granted the Schaghticoke the cov­
eted federal status. The seemingly endless process the 
tribe started when it filed a letter of intent to the BIA 
in 1981 had finally come to a close. But Connecti­
cut politicians, led by then-Attorney General Richard 
Blumenthal, placed their support behind the town of 
Kent and other landowners around the reservation 
who were opposed to the tribe earning federal recog­
nition. Connecticut, the affluent Kent School, the local 
power utility, and a dozen towns and cities requested 
that the DOI reconsider the evidence. By 2005, the 
department issued a Reconsidered Final Determina­
tion. The Schaghticoke became one of the only tribes 
in history to be stripped of its federal status through 
an overturned decision. 
“That’s the oddity of being native,” says Sarabia, 
the spiritual leader, after the ceremony. “Why do we 
have to prove who we are in our own country?”
M
ost people have left the reservation, and the 
tribe has splintered, preventing it from show­
ing a unified front. The two groups—the Schaghticoke 
Tribal Nation (STN) and the smaller Schaghticoke In­
dian Tribe (SIT)—are engaged in a bitter dispute over 
leadership. But the fight for recognition continues. 
The STN, which lost its federal status in 2005, has 
renewed hopes: in 2013, the DOI proposed making 
the acknowledgement requirements far less stringent. 
The SIT—which pushed the DOI to reconsider its ap­
proval of the STN—aims to complete its own petition 
for recognition. But a previously rejected tribe has 
little chance of emerging victorious, even if its two 
halves agree that they deserve more than just a rocky 
patch wedged between the state border and a town 
that doesn’t want them. As the opposing Schaghticoke 
chiefs challenge each other’s legitimacy, they play into 
the hands of lawmakers who say their community has 
fallen apart.
