“You don’t necessarily need to write fiction or 
poetry, but you had better be able to express yourself 
well in writing,” Rosenkranz said. 

Though Rosenkranz did not initially set out to 
support creative writing at Yale, he and the profes­
sors he endows are united by an overarching vision: 
a dedication to teaching—both inside and outside 
the classroom. 

As Langdon Hammer, chair of the English De­
partment since 2005, said, the philanthropy of 
Rosenkranz and Francis has enabled the department 
to hire, “in each case, a really extraordinary writer 
and woman of letters who happens to be an insanely 
committed teacher.”

Their commitment to teaching has earned both 
Fadiman and Gluck repeated extensions of their initial 
writer-in-residence 
contracts. 
In 2012, Fadiman received the 
Prize for Teaching Excellence by 
Non-Ladder Faculty. A glance 
through her class’s reviews by 
students is enough to validate 
the decision of the prize com­
mittee. One student claims that 
the six hours of one-on-one 
meetings with Fadiman were 
worth the entire Yale tuition.

Glück’s students also praise 
her teaching attitude and style.
“She’ll say to the class, ‘We 
are all here for the love of this 
craft and the love of this disci­
pline, and because of this, we are constantly revising 
our poems, and because of this, we are here, engaged 
with each other,’ and that’s very much what she be­
lieves, and how the class feels,” said Eleanor Marshall, 
a former student of Glück’s.

And, unlike in other classes with specific cur­
ricula, Glück enjoys creative autonomy in struc­
turing her courses. “There is no attempt by the 
donor to supervise or affect the range of teach­
ing that goes on on his dollar,” Glück said. She 
offers her students this same opportunity for 
creative self-determination.

Fadiman admitted feeling a “particular thrill” 
when her students use their writing skills to accom­
plish good—citing, for example, Sarah Stillman ’06’s 
award-winning work for The New Yorker exposing 
international human trafficking. Still, she ultimately 
echoed Glück’s emphasis on nurturing her students’ 

“I think that writing is free speech, but I don’t 
think that my role is to create political writers,” Fadi­
man said. “My goal is to create freedom, true free­
dom, giving people the skill and pleasure to use writ­
ing for whatever purpose they choose.”

At the same time, the writer-in-residence pro­
gram gives the professors, like Fadiman, the freedom 
to practice their own craft. This support allows them, 
practitioners of art forms that aren’t necessarily lucra­
tive on the free market, a certain stability. Glück feels 
grateful for the teaching profession that enables her 
to make a living and create art “without any induce­
ment” of adjusting her work to suit popular taste.

“I’m very grateful for teaching, because I’m not 
always writing, and when I’m 
not writing, I can teach,” Glück 
said. “A lot of America’s great­
est poets teach. That’s what they 
do. Some of them love it, and 
some of them tolerate it. But 
in the end, it’s how they make 
their living.”

And we students feel lucky 
to have the opportunity to work 
with our literary role models.
“This random guy, giving 
all this money, provided me 
with serendipitous opportu­
nities to sit down with Louise 
Glück. It’s sort of unreal,” Mar­
shall said. “I have benefited so much, and I know that.”

I share Marshall’s gratitude. Though the idea of 
“businessmen meddling in academia” may sound 
troubling in the abstract, the relationship between 
these donors and the writer-in-residence programs 
is highly successful. These “venture philanthropists” 
are motivated by loyalty to Yale, and trust Yale’s fac­
ulty to execute their vision. As a graduate of “Writ­
ing about Oneself,” I have personally benefited 
from the intellectual atmosphere cultivated by their 
financial generosity.
