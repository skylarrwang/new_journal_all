EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Hey everyone! You’re getting this email be­
cause I want you in my suite this weekend. 
I’ve admittedly invited a lot of you, which might 
mean our chip and pretzel rations will be de­
pleted faster, but it’s important to me that you 
each understand how much I value your friend­
ship. Please refer to the list of those cc’d, and if 
you have any unresolved tiffs with those listed, 
promptly resolve them.

Anyway, we’re calling this a “pre-game,” 
but by no means feel pressured to have plans 
for after it. We would call it a “game,” but we 
wouldn’t want anyone to think they were be­
ing rude if he or she were to leave a bit early. 
So this is somewhere between the pre- and the 
game—like, right where the hyphen would go. 
But by no means is this going to be a fast func­
tion, so maybe it’s more of an em dash? In the 
case that you’ll stay a while, feel free to pre-
game this em bash only a little, but we should 
have plenty of provisions available for buzz sus­
taining. The master and dean and four parents 
from the new Party Patrol initiative will be pres­
ent (better safe than sorry!), so our best advice 
is to not get sloppy.

You will see in the Paperless Post to follow 
(theme TBD, but soliciting suggestions) that 
we have not yet decided on an exact time for 
next Fridays’s get together. That’s because we 
want to uphold the democratic process in our 
festivities. We need your input! Please fill out 
this Doodle poll before 3 p.m. today so that we 
know when is best for everyone and can maxi­
mize attendance. Check out this Excel spread­
sheet we’ve put together, where everyone can 
sign up to bring a dish to share—we’re all le­
gal adults, and it’s about time we started act­
ing (read: throwing potlucks) like it. And please 
complete this Survey Monkey with whatever 
dietary preferences and allergies you may have. 
Best allergy will be rewarded with a voucher for 
one (1) free rice cake. While I have your atten­
tion, I’ll also just add a small reminder that our 
suite has a blanket gluten-free rule, so it’s not 
necessary to mention that in the survey. We’ll 
be drinking a whiskey made from quinoa and 
kombucha to mix. Beer will be a squash lager 
(non-GMO). Diet Coke, seltzer, and whatever 
else you BYO will be available, but only so long 
as you BYO.

Do also note that I’ve attached a few PDFs 
to the end of this email, which we would like you 
to fill out and bring upon your arrival next Friday. 
One of our friends is going to be doing a site 
reading at this party for an anthropology class, 
so there’s a human-subjects research waiver to 
sign for the Institutional Review Board. There’s 
also a document with some questions about 
your vaccination history—if you haven’t been 
vaccinated for measles, mumps, or rubella, 
please let me know SOONER RATHER THAN 
LATER so that I can have the appropriate ho­
meopathic serums on hand in case of a break­
out. We’ve got plenty of Purell, though. Last but 
certainly not least, there will be a photographer 
at the event, but we need your OK and your 
signature before we post any shots to Face­
book, because last semester a girl sued when 
her employer got an unsavory glimpse of her 
double-fisting sugar-free mimosas. Net posi­
tive, though: we weren’t found liable, the com­
munity service hours were memorable, and 
we’re implementing the “Danielle Rule” from 
now on—no double-fisting in photographs, nay, 
at all.

Speaking of social media, the designated 
hashtag for this event is “#OldCampusRag­
er2015.” Of course, feel free to use your own 
alternative (“#OldCampusLowKeyHang2015,” 
or “#OldCampusNoExpectationsNightOut”) if 
you have one—we don’t want to be at all pre­
scriptive with regards to your experience at the 
party, and hope you’ll make it whatever feels 
most comfortable for you! Other things: please 
say you’re attending on this Facebook event, 
and click here to join the GroupMe that can be 
used if you feel at any point that the music is too 
loud.  The Spotify playlist here is customizable 
and public, so have fun with it, but keep it sans 
anything with a parental advisory. We’re asking 
that everyone submit three song choices, and 
at least one of them has to be considered “Con­
temporary World,” which will ensure engaging 
conversation about non-Western instruments 
(new obsession, LOL), among other things. And 
though I’ve mentioned there will be a photogra­
pher, we’re recommending everyone download 
the latest version of the Camera app on his or 
her iPhone. High-definition or bust!

Dress code is as follows: tasteful-mocktail-
early-evening attire. Nothing garish, nothing 
too formal, but please try to look put togeth­
er. We have a few gender-neutral grey frocks 
up for grabs if you don’t think an appropriate 
look can be assembled from your wardrobe. 
If you’re still unsure of what to wear, feel free 
to send me an email. I’m happy to grab cof­
fee at any point to discuss—though, know in 
advance that Mondays and Thursdays aren’t 
my best, Tuesdays I tend to be pretty busy, 
and Wednesdays I’m usually in meetings most 
of the day. That offer goes for any concerns 
you might have—next week’s function will be 
your night, and I want to make sure it meets 
your standards.

Last things last! A list of people you should 
put into your phone in case of emergency is 
attached. We will have chargers for 4s and 5s 
on hand, but we’d recommend that you bring 
your own in case demand exceeds supply. A 
generator can supply power in case of blackout 
(electrical blackout, mind you). You will need 
to present this email, a printed version of this 
email, or a hologram of this email to gain en­
try to the party, and we’ve submitted a list of 
names and blood types to the Yale security of­
fice, so your ID/fingerprick sample should allow 
you to get into the entryway without a problem. 
And finally, remember: you must be 21 to drink 
in the state of Connecticut, marijuana has not 
yet been decriminalized, and your presence is a 
present (but Venmo donations to defray some 
of the costs are welcomed). 
Room A41. Should be fun!
