cates that an SIT petition will be considered when it 
is submitted.
Buchanan states that Russell has 4,000 documents 
in his house that could address the gaps in the STN’s 
records. It’s a dubious claim, given that SIT lacked the 
millions their opponents spent to unearth all of the 
relevant paperwork, but he could be right, if tribal 
members withheld their personal records until now. 
Until the petition is complete, it remains to be seen 
what the BIA will say. “When we get approved, all 
hell’s going to break through,” Buchanan says, with­
out a doubt that the SIT will succeed. 


Regardless of whether or not Russell has grounds 
for a new petition, his complaints show just how 
high-stakes the fight for reservation land has be­
come. As reservations have become more restricted, 
the chief’s role in defending the land and the tribe 
becomes increasingly politicized. The disagreements 
over land affect the healthcare, schooling, and em­
ployment prospects of hundreds of people, to say 
nothing of their cultural identity and ancestral land.
“I don’t care about federal recognition. I really 
don’t. I just want to live here peacefully,” Russell says 
earnestly. But in the legal web spun around native land 
rights, there are many more factors at play. As matters 
of sovereignty become fixed into the law, one man’s 
desire to stay in his house becomes a problem far be­
yond the bounds of his gateposts.
The town of Kent has one traffic light and a popu­
lation of about 3,000. Bruce Adams, who leads the 
town’s Board of Selectmen, looks out from the sec­
ond floor of the Kent Town Hall. There are a handful 
of parked cars and a shopping center that has seen 
better days, but the town has remained as quaint as 
when he moved there in the 1970s. One of its major 
tourist attractions is still the nineteenth-century Bull’s 
Bridge, one of the only covered wooden bridges in 
Connecticut. “If a casino were built in this town, it 
would change this town forever,” Adams says.
The tribal members have explicitly stated that, if 
they received federal recognition, they would be more 
interested in building gaming facilities in other parts 
of the state, near larger cities that would bring cus­
tomers. Adams doubts the Schaghticoke would build a 
casino in Kent, but the possibility that they would do 
so is enough to set him on edge. He fears the changes 
he has seen in the towns around Connecticut’s exist­
ing gaming centers: traffic, overcrowding, construc­
tion. Even if the tribe just opened a bingo facility 
or to started to sell tax-free cigarettes and liquor, he 
worries that they would compromise the town’s New 
England feel. 


As a local social studies teacher for over thirty 
years, he has taught children from both Kent and the 
Schaghticoke reservation. Still, Adams speculates that 
if the tribe were to win all of its land claims, it could 
hypothetically force the closure of the Kent School, 
the prestigious boarding school founded in 1906. The 
Schaghticoke could also tear down the town’s sew­
age treatment plant, which would cost $9 million to 
replace. Velky calls Adams’s statements “fear-monger­
ing” unfounded in fact. But reflecting on the relation­
ship between the town and the tribe, Adams says, “It’s 
become antagonistic for one reason, and one reason 
only: money.” 


The state of Connecticut takes Adams’s side in the 
debate over federal recognition. The proposal by the 
BIA to streamline the federal recognition process pos­
es a new threat. The published draft states that third 
parties would be able to veto petitions from tribes 
that were formerly denied recognition, which would 
give the state the right to intervene. But no one knows 
whether the regulations will be passed in their cur­
rent form. After a series of public hearings last sum­
mer, the tentative plan is still under consideration. 
According to the BIA, only seventeen of the 566 
federally recognized tribes have made it through the 
current BIA process under the current regulations 
since 1978. Most of the others had been approved by 
Congressional actions. The new rules would require 
the tribe to demonstrate that they have maintained a 
community with an active political body since 1934, 
as opposed to “historic times.” This would drastically 
reduce the amount of paperwork, legal maneuvering, 
and funding required, especially if the existence of 
state reservations is considered sufficient proof. Since 
July 2014, close to 3,000 people submitted testimony 
about whether the BIA should approve the proposal. 
Led by Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal, all of 
the state’s Congressional representatives wrote a let­
ter in opposition to the more lenient requirements. 
Governor Dannel P. Malloy wrote his own letter, stat­
ing that, for Connecticut, “the consequence would 
be devastating.” 


“When does no mean no? What gives anyone the 
right to lighten the rules?” Adams asks. He coaches 
after-school sports, and he likens the situation to an 
athletic competition: “Remember that game you lost 
back in 2001? We’re changing the rules, and we’re 
going to give you another try at winning the game.” 
Or, in the bleak words he recounts from one of his at­
torneys, “It’s a little bit like Whack-A-Mole.” Whenev­
er Kent seems to finally be safe, the tribe pops back up. 
Adams rejects the notion that communities who 
have been so thoroughly disenfranchised for centuries 
deserve reparations: he believes that the time for that 
has passed. The Oneida Nation lost a land rights case in 
Sherrill County, New York, several years ago, because 
the judge ruled that the land had been under different 
ownership for too many years. And Adams states that 
the same must be true when looking at what is owed 
to the Native Americans in Connecticut. The town has 
already spent $400,000 to fight the Schaghticoke over 
the last fifteen years, partly through a group called 
Town Action to Save Kent (TASK). 


“There’s no question that wrongs were done to 
Native Americans way back when,” he says. “But I 
think we’ve gone too far the other way in trying to 
make things right.”
