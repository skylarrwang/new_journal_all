“T
his is our comeback,” said Andy Wolf. It was Janu­
ary 14, 2015, and the College Street Music Hall had 
big news to share. The theatre, after being shut down for 
thirteen years, announced plans to reopen in May. For­
merly known as the Palace, and then as the Roger Sher­
man, it had shut down in 2002 after nearly eighty years 
at the center of New Haven’s cultural scene. Even though 
it passed almost immediately into the hands of the New 
Haven Center for the Performing Arts, it has remained 
vacant since then. Now, recent changes in the small non­
profit’s leadership have sparked an effort to bring the 
property back to life. 

For Wolf, director of New Haven’s Department of 
Arts, Culture, and Tourism, this is about more than an 
old property regaining functionality. It’s about revital­
izing downtown through the performing arts. And al­
though it isn’t technically the city’s project—the funding 
has come from a private company—the idea behind it 
came from City Hall. 

Both Wolf and Mayor Toni Harp envision a complete 
transformation of College Street. Instead of just a few 
blocks with restaurants and theatres, City Hall wants to 
create a scaled-down Times Square, complete with neon 
marquees and throngs of pedestrians. The comparison 
with New York is not accidental. In recent years, musical 
acts have skipped over New Haven, moving straight from 
the Big Apple to Boston or Providence. Wolf wants those 
groups to stop at the College Street Music Hall. “Soon, 
New Haven’s going to be the sixth borough,” he said. 

To most, the idea that New Haven could sparkle like 
Times Square seems far-fetched. But when the venue 
opened as the Palace Theatre in 1924, New Haven was 
a major stop in the American performing arts scene. Ev­
eryone from Marlon Brando to the Marx Brothers passed 
through. For much of the twentieth century, the musi­
cals and vaudeville shows performed at the Palace The­
ater made it a cornerstone of New Haven’s cultural life. 
And with the Schubert Theatre just across the street, the 
image of College Street as a mini theater district wasn’t 
so far off the mark.

New Haven real estate mogul Joel Schiavone, whose 
company owned the Palace Theatre, renovated its façade 
and lobby in 1984. But when the company went bank­
rupt in the early 2000s, the Palace shut down. The Fed­
eral Deposit Insurance Corporation then acquired the 
building and stipulated that a nonprofit organization be­
come the next owner. That organization was the NHCPA.

The only problem was that the NHCPA did not have 
the funds to reopen the theatre. Consequentially, the the­
atre languished. Then, in 2014, with a new mayor for 
the first time in twenty years, the city approached com­
mercial real estate investor Keith Mahler to start working 
on the project. 

The impetus came partly from Matthew Nemerson,
