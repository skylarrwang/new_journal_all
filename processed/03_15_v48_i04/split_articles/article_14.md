cerns about the Schaghticoke’s claim have has always 
existed. “It’s a long, drawn-out affair,” he says at the 
end of the presentation of arguments. 

The representatives of the defendants stand out­
side the courtroom congratulating one another for a 
job well done, and Velky walks past them without a 
word as he makes his way to the exit. Elliott insists 
that once the STN loses this case, its land claim is over. 
But of course, as rules shift, the matter is never so 
simple. “If the BIA enacts the proposed regulations, 
this tribe will go back to the BIA to be recognized and 
they will be recognized,” Schell tells me, matter-of-
factly. It is irrelevant to these defendants which of the 
chiefs triumphs; to them, Velky and Russell are on the 
same side of the problem. But for now, since the tribe 
has not met the standards for federal recognition, the 
defendants have won their case.

n the fall, back on the Schaghticoke reservation, 
Bellantoni, the former state archeologist, is plac­
ing the bones into a gravesite. Kneeling over a hole 
dug in the corner of the cemetery, he pulls out fe­
murs, tibias, and smaller fragments from the white 
tissue in which they are wrapped. Prior to 1990, they 
would have likely been discarded, or simply covered 
up, since they were found on the site of what used to 
be a Native American fort. A sand and gravel company 
blew up the area in the early 1900s, Yale research­
ers excavated some of the remains in the 1930s and 
1940s, and another construction company brought a 
bulldozer to sift through the ground about a decade 
ago. Now, the location is being prepared for condo­
miniums, and Bellantoni has driven the remains 
across the state so they can settle into the ground on 
Schaghticoke territory. 

“We can’t know they are Schaghticoke, but they 
are of native descent,” says Velky. It has never been im­
portant to him and his tribe to prove the specifics of 
lineage—that is the concern of the politicians around 
them. “If they don’t end up here, they’re going to end 
up in some museum,” he adds. 

The Schaghticoke encircle the hole in the corner 
of the cemetery. One man brings clippings of fresh 
pine to lay in the grave, and Velky rubs sage from a 
Ziploc bag between his hands as he stands over the 
dirt pit. Bellantoni covers the bones with 4,000-year-
old flint spearheads that were found at the site and 
may have been funerary objects. A tribal member adds 
the rest of the tobacco at the end, and the men begin 
to cover it up with shovels. 

There will be no bulldozer coming to the Scha­
ghticoke cemetery, no matter what the U.S. govern­
ment decides. At the very least, the tribe’s members 
know that they have four hundred acres where they 
can continue to gather. They come on days like this to 
eat hamburgers around a campfire, or test their guns 
in preparation for deer-hunting season, or practice 
rituals that have been sacred for centuries. But people 
don’t lie quietly, like bones. They turn against one an­
other and speak angrily of how they have suffered.
