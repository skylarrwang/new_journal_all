Ruth Garby Torres, a Schaghticoke historian, says 
that the tribe is partly responsible for its current con­
dition. She critiques both tribal groups for foregoing 
reconciliation. “We’ve been victimized by a process, 
but there’s blame to be shared within the tribe,” she 
says. “There’s failure, or an inability, or both, to figure 
out how to move forward and still disagree.” 


The office of Richard Velky, chief of the Schagh­
ticoke Tribal Nation, is packed with the paper trail of 
more than a quarter century of legal battles. Tall black 
file cabinets sit next to shelves filled with fat binders. A 
dream catcher with a decorative snake coiled around 
it hangs on the wall. Towers of cardboard boxes with 
scrawled red labels lean against one another between 
the plastic potted pants. In the largest room of the 
Derby office, the curtains are drawn and the ceiling 
is unfinished, giving it the air of a forgotten attic. As I 
glance at Velky’s desk, I find a glossy flyer for the Cali­
fornia Gaming Summit next to a Coca-Cola bottle and 
a mug with a Native American wearing a headdress.


“Inside these walls here, we have over 45,000 
pages to prove our heritage,” says Velky, a portly man 
with receding white hair. He points to a stack of giant 
Rubbermaid tubs, one of an estimated hundred in the 
office. The BIA’s regulations have forced tribal mem­
bers to become hyper-specific about their heritage, so 
the tribal office has started to look like the home of a 
hoarder. Velky calmly describes the countless letters he 
has written and reports he has filed. Only on occasion 
does he slip into the tone of a boxer who has taken a 
few too many punches. 


The current process of tribal recognition was 
created in 1978; prior to that, groups were declared 
tribes by acts of Congress. However, the process is no­
toriously slow, as both the tribes and the BIA are often 
disorganized. The Schaghticoke filed a letter of intent 
to petition in 1981, but they didn’t complete their pe­
tition for another thirteen years. They lagged behind 
two other Connecticut tribes, the Mohegans and the 
Mashantucket PequWWots, who each opened their 
own enormous casinos after winning federal recog­
nition. Until two years ago, the Foxwood Resort Ca­
sino, owned by the Pequot, was the largest casino in 
the U.S.


Casinos, with their glitzy, seedy vibe, are glorified 
in Vegas movies and vilified in debates about moral 
towns. They complicate the BIA’s already convoluted 
processes. In 1988, Congress passed the Indian Gam­
ing Regulatory Act, granting tribes special gaming 
rights. The number of petitions skyrocketed as tribes 
seized the opportunity for economic growth. In Con­
necticut, federally recognized tribes are the only 
groups permitted to own casinos, and Velky considers 
the state government’s fear of additional casinos to be 
the primary cause of its opposition to the Schaghti­
coke. He insists that he is not pressing for recognition 
exclusively because of gaming rights, but he would 
consider opening a casino outside of the current 
reservation land.


Yet casinos attract more than tourists. Steven Aus­
tin, who worked as an anthropologist for the STN, 
spelled out the politicians’ fears. “The casinos bring 
in corruption, problems with prostitution and drugs, 
and other evils,” he says. The state’s concerns extend 
beyond gaming, to tribes’ potentially far-reaching 
land claims, and their exemption from state and local 
property regulations. Though a quarter out of every 
dollar played at the Mohegan Sun or Foxwoods Re­
sort Casino, excluding gamblers’ final winnings, goes 
to the state in lieu of taxes, the economic calculation 
doesn’t necessarily work out in the state’s favor. Tribal 
recognition confers the right to additional expen­
sive social services. It also makes cuts into the state’s 
tax base.


But the grounds for the Reconsidered Final Deter­
mination have to do with something far more techni­
cal: historical gaps in the tribe’s extensive documenta­
tion. According to Velky, the problem arises from the 
fact that community leaders kept poor records in both 
the 1800s and 1900s. The fact that a state reservation 
existed bolstered the Schaghticoke’s original case, but 
Connecticut politicians protested against using state 
recognition as a marker of community, leading to the 
DOI’s painful revision. 


“THAT’S THE ODDITY OF 
BEING NATIVE,” SAYS 
SARABIA, THE SPIRITUAL 
LEADER, AFTER THE 
CEREMONY. “WHY DO WE 
HAVE TO PROVE WHO WE 
ARE IN OUR OWN COUNTRY?”

Velky still remembers camping on the reserva­
tion with other tribal members to tend a spiritual fire 
in the two weeks before the DOI’s 2005 decision. It 
was Columbus Day when they received news of the 
Reconsidered Final Determination, which invalidated 
their federal status. Finality had come and gone, and a 
torrential rain started to fall. “That was our ancestors 
talking aloud, saying that they were upset,” he says. 


Research and litigation have cost the tribe an 
estimated $20 million, much of which came from 
Subway founder Frederick A. DeLuca, who may have 
expected a cut of eventual casino profits. “The only 
way we can pay investors back is through gaming,” 
Velky explains. (The Director of Corporate Commu­
nications for Subway said DeLuca was unable to com­
ment).


DeLuca cut off his financial support after the tribe 
lost its recognition, so Velky is left to collect money 
from other private investors, hoping they can stretch 
funds far enough. Even now that the research pro­
cess is complete, he must pay a few hundred dollars 
each month to keep his office, located above a hair 
salon and a chiropractor, with a view overlooking a 
parking lot. 


The chief insists that where he really belongs is 
on the reservation: “If you go out this way, you see 
the first house. My grandfather was born in that house 
in 1903,” Velky explains on the day of the ceremony, 
gesturing at a boarded-up brown house with white-
trimmed windows. The government made it difficult 
to for tribal members to return after they first moved 
away. According to Velky, overseers from the state wel­
fare department denied his grandfather permission to 
return to the land in the 1950s. In the 1960s, he says, 
Kent firemen used some of the tribal houses for train­
ing drills, igniting some of the recently abandoned 
homes and preventing them from being passed on to 
younger generations of Schaghticoke. 


The tribe has become increasingly diffuse far 
from the land. Prior to a wedding in 2011, it had 
been 114 years since there had been a marriage be­
tween two Schaghticoke members. But over a de­
cade ago, when Velky last surveyed the Schaghticoke, 
eighty families said they would return to the land if 
given the change. He believes they the rest, like him, 
have held onto that dream. 


W
e enter an adjoining room in the office, where a 
walking stick adorned with antlers and pheas­
ant feathers lies nestled behind a large paper shred­
der. The abandoned fax machine and black-and-white 
images of traditionally dressed Native Americans are 
a reminder of what the recognition process has be­
come. It is a fierce assertion of identity that relies 
upon endless clerical work. Yet Velky is determined 
to carry on. “Our people have been in every war for 
the people that are in the United States,” he tells me 
with pride and a hint of rancor. “We have fought dil­
igently for our people and our rights, and we have 
been neglected.” 


Alan Russell, the leader of SIT, is the tribal mem­
ber who knows best what it means to call the land 
home. He is one of a handful of Schaghticoke who still 
live on the reservation. His newly rebuilt house sits up 
the road from the clearing where Velky’s people park 
their cars during the annual fall cleanup, which he 
does not attend. Velky and Russell do not speak to one 
another. Both claim to be the properly elected Schagh­
ticoke chief; both claim that the other has essentially 
forged the names on his membership rolls to make 
them look more legitimate. 


When I meet Russell on his property in Novem­
ber, behind the sign “BEWARE OF DOG,” he alleges 
that Velky is a fraud, one who has forced himself 
into the role of chief, and who has made headlines 
only because of his shady financial supporters. Rus­
sell, in the meantime, is still trying to muster up the 
money required to complete his petition for federal 
recognition. According to Bill Buchanan, a construc­
tion worker who has been the SIT’s primary consul­
tant over the past decade, the petition will be com­
pleted this year. He himself is not Schaghticoke—he 
has no Native American heritage whatsoever—but he 
strangely points out that he is a relative of William 
Boyd, the actor who played the famed cowboy Ho­
palong Cassidy. “It’s kind of a modern-day cowboy-
and-Indian event,” he adds, as though he could revise 
America’s history by stepping into the spurred boots 
of a cowboy hero.      


The 67-year-old Russell leans on a rake as he tells 
me his goals are more modest than Velky’s. A trading 
post, medical benefits, and educational scholarships 
would be nice for his people. But the real reason he 
is considering filing for federal recognition is because 
he fears that Velky would attempt to throw him off the 
land. “If he ever tried that, he’d be a dead man,” Rus­

sell says. Though his family lived in New Haven for a 
few years after Russell’s father enlisted in World War 
II, they moved back to the land when Russell was only 
four years old. There is a video, he tells me, of him 
taking his first footsteps next to the wooden sign that 
says “Schaghticoke Indian Reservation.” 


The Schaghticoke, like the officials who have 
combed through their family records, are mired in 
a genealogical argument, as they note and scrutinize 
every happy marriage and every sour divorce. Rus­
sell states that he and Velky are distant cousins—they 
share a white great-grandmother—but Russell is de­
scended from her first marriage, with Schaghticoke 
Jim-Pan Harris, while “Velky is the product of a white 
man.” Though the BIA ruled that Velky has provided 
adequate proof of his ancestry, the SIT will not relent. 


Buchanan claims that, earlier this year, Velky’s nephew 
submitted his saliva to ancestry.com to find out if he 
is Native American. It was Buchanan’s suggestion that 
he use the genealogy site, but the relative never sent 
him the results.  


Both parties accuse each other of foul play. Velky 
suspects that Russell burned down the central pavil­
ion on the reservation and pulled out the crosses from 
Velky’s relatives’ graves. Russell claims that Velky ha­
rassed Russell’s dying mother and threatened his wife 
with a knife. “They play dirty, you know what I’m 
saying?” Russell asks me. I struggle to reconcile his 
claims with my memory of the man who offered me 
a warm handshake just a few hours before, and whose 
grandkids played games by the campfire.


STN membership remains at around 300 while 
SIT’s formal membership hovers closer to 125. Bu­
chanan, Russell’s consultant, insists that Velky copied 
the names of SIT members onto the STN’s member­
ship list and pretended that there had been some sort 
of reconciliation between the two groups to get fed­
eral recognition. What the Reconsidered Final Deter­
mination actually says is that there were a significant 
number of people who declined to enroll in the STN, 
which means that the STN is not representative of the 
entire Schaghticoke community. The document indi­
