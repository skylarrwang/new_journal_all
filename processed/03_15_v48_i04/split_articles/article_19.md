lar ideology, they are participating in a different kind 
of action, one that celebrates the act of making and 
being together, in a society where activities like this 
are rare.

I had sought punks with radical values. Instead I 
had found mothers caring just as deeply, if not about 
ideology, then about their neighborhood.

New Haven knitters were invested in their com­
munity-based creation. But a small part of me still 
wondered: where, if not locally, could I find the knit­
ters who were using the craft to tackle capitalism, pa­
triarchy, and environmental destruction? The women 
I talked to mentioned ravelry.com, what Machesney 
called “Facebook for knitters,” several times. The day I 
returned from our interview, I made an account.

Ravelry is a fairly anonymous social network, cen­
tered on what we make instead of who we are. Knit­
ters catalog their yarn “stashes,” document their prog­
ress on projects, and ask for help with tricky patterns. 
Recent forum subject lines include everything from 
“Smocking Stitch Brimmed Hat (help, please!)” to 
“Math Question…” to “Crafty Word Game.” But the 
forums also host discussions about subjects that the 
knitters I spoke to in person were hesitant to broach. 
Threads include “The things we’re too polite to say/
can’t say out loud…” “Please explain radical femi­
nism as charitably as possible?” “Should we dump 
‘Mrs’ and ‘Miss’?” “Islamic feminism” and “Femnants: 
what are you reading?” Groups like the “Big Issues 
Debate Group” start threads about Ferguson, Ebola, 
voter turnout in the United States, and God. 

The future of political knitting communities 
seems to be online, an unlikely home for those who 
harbor some serious nostalgia for Grandma’s hand­
made hats. But Ravelry also shows me the variety of 
forms knitting communities can take. I found that to­
day’s yarn-bombing enthusiasts in New Haven aren’t 
pink-haired activists holding up signs that say “PEACE 
KNITS.” The seemingly modest goals of Westville knit­
ters can coexist with the sweeping ideals of Turney’s 
book and the nonstop buzz of Ravelry’s forums. The 
projects under way in Westville that aspire to bring 
together neighbors may seem self-contained, but they 
are part of a larger quilt of movements and crafting 
groups that continue to adapt, even as they practice 
a historical craft. The nature of the craft seems to en­
courage constant revision and restructuring of the 
communities that support it: after all, yarn can always 
be unraveled, and the knitter can begin again.

The benefactors behind Yale’s popular creative writing writing courses
by Grace Hirshorn
O
ne evening last November, I sat next to Anne 
Fadiman, sipping red wine and enjoying Mory’s 
famous Baker’s Soup, as Anne told our table of current 
and former students her famous “car service story.” 
When she first came to Yale to give a Master’s Tea, she 
invited a Yale graduate to travel with her in the hour-
and-a-half ride back to her home in Whately, Massa­
chusetts, in order to discuss the craft of editing. 

Paul Francis ’77, sponsor of the Francis Writer-
in-Residence Program, sat at a neighboring table, 
surrounded by alumni of the writing program that 
bears his name. Ultimately, it was Francis’s generos­
ity that made the dinner possible, and it was his spe­
cific intention of endowing a “pastoral” professor that 
brought us Anne. So the story goes, when the selec­
tion committee learned of Fadiman’s traveling men­
torship, they knew immediately that Fadiman would 
fulfill Francis’s vision. 

ne afternoon last December, I ascended to the 
thirtieth floor offices of Delphi Financial, over­
looking New York City, to sit down with the two
