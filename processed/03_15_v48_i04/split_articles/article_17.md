litical activism. In the 1960s, you 
could find him facing off with 
the police in Civil Rights protests 
(and, on two occasions, locked up 
in a Houston jail cell). Fast forward 
half a century, and Brison was still 
at it, out-campaigning a well-es­
tablished Democrat in 2008 to be­
come one of the only Green Party 
representatives ever to sit on the 
New Haven Board of Alders. And he 
remains an enthusiastic protester: 
the People’s Climate March, Black 
Lives Matter demonstrations—you 
name it, Brison is there.

But he hadn’t made the con­
nection between his diet and his 
activism until he met Zach Groff. 
While many of the members were 
already active in the animal rights 
movement, it was Groff’s organiz­
ing and fiery emails that brought 
DXE Connecticut together. 

As a leader of a protest move­
ment, Groff is unusual. He is low-
key, and he does not go in for the 
kind of oversimplification that 
makes for good political rhetoric. 
He graduated from Yale in 2013 
and now works for a New Haven 
nonprofit that tackles global pover­
ty alleviation. He knows that DXE 
can seem like a crazy fringe group, 
and, when I visited his apartment, 
he was quick to assure me that 
animal activism had nothing to do 
with his day job.  

I had once again donned my 
vegan get-up—my pants fall­
ing off, my shoes a-glitter—but I 
needn’t have worried about Groff 
going on a fire-and-brimstone ti­
rade against leather or wool. “Now 
that I scream in restaurants, the la­
bel ‘angry vegan’ is appropriate,” 
Groff conceded. “But in my per­
sonal encounters I’m a lot more 
soft-spoken. I’m quite shocked 
that I’m doing this.” And it turns 
out that neither leather nor wool is 
part of DXE’s campaign. 

Groff speaks the way you 
would imagine a Yale grad might: 
a mile a minute, every sentence 
packed with quotes and statistics 
and subtle distinctions. He men­
tions so many philosophers, econ­
omists, and fellow activists that it 
is hard to keep track of his verbal 
footnotes. He identifies himself 
with a philosophical movement 
called effective altruism. “It’s all 
these nerdy people who are also 
bleeding hearts, who want to fig­
ure out how to do good,” he said. 
Their tool is rationality, and more 
specifically, utilitarian argument.

Past animal rights campaigns 
have focused on fur and animal 
testing. But the number of animals 
who suffer to make coats and phar­
maceuticals is tiny when compared 
to the number of animals slaugh­
tered for food. I asked about the 
buzzwords we hear all the time: 
local, humane, free range, grain 
fed. “It’s not going to be possible 
for us to have a society where we 
raise animals decently in order 
to kill them to put them on our 
plates,” he said. 

Groff may describe himself as 
rational and soft-spoken, but our 
interview happened to fall on elec­
tion night, and I could see the po­
litical firebrand emerge every time 
he turned to the coverage being 
streamed from his computer onto 
the TV in his living room. When 
Chris Christie appeared, Groff 
snarled: “He’s totally fine vetoing 
laws against gestation crates”—
criminally small cages into which 
pigs are packed. “We should just 
put him in a gestation crate. I’d 
be happy to eat him if someone 
served him to me.”


“YOU NEED TO 
HAVE DRAMATIC 
ACTIONS AND 
THEY NEED TO BE 
CONFRONTATIONAL. 
AND YOU CAN DO 
THAT COMPLETELY 
WITHIN THE LIMITS 
OF THE LAW. YOU 
WANT TO SPREAD 
THE MEME OF 
ANTI-SPECIESISM 
AS QUICKLY AS 
POSSIBLE.”

Meanwhile, right-wing pun­
dits have not held back from 
launching equally biting attacks 
on DXE. At Bluestem Brasserie, a 
fancy restaurant in San Francisco, 
an activist named Kelly Atlas gave 
a speech last September about the 
abuse that her “little girl” had suf­
fered—her little girl being a chick­
en rescued from a factory farm. As 
Motown-hits played through the 
restaurant speakers, she looked 
around the room at the smirks on 
diners’ faces, and began to cry. 

Her heartfelt words were 
picked up by Glenn Beck and Rush 
Limbaugh, both of whom wasted 
no time pointing out how absurd 
the message was. They listed press­
ing issues that, in their opinion, 
deserve more attention than the 
plight of a chicken. And even lib­
erals who love to hate Limbaugh 
and Beck would have to admit that 
they have a point: police brutality 
in Ferguson, New York and the rest 
of the country is simply more ur­
gent than the pain of farm animals. 

Groff, however, views animal 
liberation as neglected by the very 
people who ought to support it. 
“Animal rights is the orphan of 
the left,” he said, quoting a blog 
post by another DXE activist. And 
though pundits may laugh at out­
pourings of emotion on behalf of 
animals, Groff feels that any pub­
licity is good publicity. “You need 
to have dramatic actions and they 
need to be confrontational. And 
you can do that completely within 
the limits of the law. You want to 
spread the meme of anti-specie­
sism as quickly as possible.”

As the night continued, the pro­
testers’ speeches became more 
personal, their performances more 
convincing. In Shake Shack, the 
staff had a powwow behind the 
counter, but none of them inter­
rupted the funeral procession.

Suzanne Beck, holding up a 
picture of a rooster as if at a vigil, 
raised her voice and began: “Pum­
pernickel was a smart and social 
rooster. He knew his name and un­
derstood when his mom told him 
to go lay down or go eat or go play 
with the cats. He loved to be held 
and kissed and was very protec­
tive of his mom who took him in 
when he was a baby. Pumpernickel 
loved to chat with us and he loved 
to hear how beautiful he was. He 
was one of the most social beings 
I ever knew.”

Then it was Bianca’s turn. 
She had no picture of the pig of 
whom she spoke, but her voice 
rose with emotion, as if speaking 
about a dear friend who had nar­
rowly survived a deadly illness: 
“Franklin is one of the lucky ones. 
He is one of my favorite pigs to 
visit at the animal sanctuary. When 
he was a five-pound piglet, he 
was tossed into the dead pile but 
a concerned neighbor noticed he 
was still alive. She rescued him 
and brought him to the sanctu­
ary. When I visit him he comes 
when you call his name. He loves 
hugs and cuddling in his hay as he 
peacefully falls asleep now know­
ing he will have another day, as all 
animals should.”

Some customers were smiling, 
others were filming. All burgers 
and shakes were left untouched. 
“The dairy industry knew her 
as Number 4391, but to me her 
name was Grace,” Groff said. He 
projected without shouting, like 
someone delivering a soliloquy to 
a packed theater. “Like you and me, 
she wanted only love and kindness, 
but she was used, abused, and then 
discarded by the dairy industry, 
impregnated until she ran dry and 
then thrown out like trash.”

The grand finale was saved for 


“DID YOU KNOW 
THAT AT THE 
FARMS THAT 
SUPPLY PLACES 
LIKE WAL-MART, 
THEY TEAR 
OFF THE BABY 
PIGS’ TESTICLES 
WITHOUT ANY 
ANESTHESIA?”

Brison. “We know that violence 
against innocents is wrong,” he 
said. He did not speak particularly 
loudly, but the restaurant had gone 
silent, and his voice was perfectly 
audible over the background mu­
sic. “We stand with heavy hearts 
to speak for those whose voices 
were silenced by corporate greed 
and lies.”

Over the course of the evening, 
I watched as a loose collective of 
vegans became a coalition of activ­
ists. They began to chant again as 
they filed out of Shake Shack, no 
one breaking character. They had 
not planned to demonstrate in this 
many restaurants, but now they 
were so pumped that they couldn’t 
help themselves. As they passed by 
restaurants they didn’t intend to 
enter, they held up their signs as if 
they were talismans, to keep away 
the carnivorous evil eye. Some­
one suggested that we go up the 
street, to teach Union League a les­
son. Union League was big. Union 
League was The Man. 

The Union League Café is 
an upscale restaurant “in a nine­
teenth-century setting,” as its web­
site states, where ducks and cows 
are given posthumous French 
names and wine pairings to match. 
We filed up the stairs, and through 
wood-and-glass doors into the 
dining room. As the activists be­
gan to shout, the polite murmurs 
of fine dining hushed. A man to 
my left looked up from his “Selec­
tion of Artisanal Cheeses.” A waiter 
in a black vest paused, his metal 
crumb-scraper and crumb-dusted 
plate held demurely at his waist. 
Dressed as we were in sneakers 
and funeral black, with our make­
shift coffin held aloft, we hadn’t 
expected to be let in, but no one 
interrupted the speeches for a 
while, until the owner emerged. 
“You leave this place right now 
or I go to the police,” he said in 
a thick French accent. He pointed 
a fat finger towards the door. “I 
call the cops because this is not 
normal.” As we filed back out, he 
gave Suzanne Beck a little push in 
the back.

On Sunday, December 7, I met 
up with DXE Connecticut 
just as they were being escorted 
out of a mall in Milford by a se­
curity guard. When the guard 
began to warn them about the 
dangers of animal overpopula­
tion, Suzanne Beck looked him 
in the eyes and replied, “Did you 
know that at the farms that sup­
ply places like Wal-Mart, they tear 
off the baby pigs’ testicles without 
any anesthesia? You should think 
about that next time you want 
to eat some bacon.” The guard’s 
smile faded. He reached for the 
walkie-talkie at his belt. “I think 
it’s time for you to go.”

But 
DXE 
isn’t 
going 
anywhere soon. 
In January, DXE unveiled a new 
campaign. They had kept it secret 
up until then, Groff says, for fear of 
“industrial spies.” The group’s na­
tional organizers say they jumped 
the fence of a chicken farm in Cali­
fornia that supplies Whole Foods 
with eggs. On YouTube, you can 
watch them exploring the pens 
late at night, sickly chickens il­
luminated by the beam of their 
headlamps. In another scene, they 
take one of these chickens to a vet, 
who diagnoses a litany of health 
problems: a cut beak, long-term 
diarrhea, maggot infestation. The 
farm’s owner has insisted that the 
chickens filmed were not his and 
that he respects all humane and 
organic certification requirements. 
The New York Times also reported 
that trimming chicken’s beaks is 
indeed standard practice to pre­
vent chickens from pecking their 
pen-mates, which can lead to can­
nibalism. DXE sees this as a testa­
ment to the chickens’ inhumane 
living situation.

You may be forced to think 
more closely about those chickens 
next time you go to Whole Foods. 
DXE has been staging protests in 
stores around the country, holding 
signs and playing animal sounds 
from their cell phones. In Con­
necticut, they have recruited a few 
Yale students, who have brought 
along their friends. They are con­
vinced that they are right. It may 
be relatively easy to dismiss them 
as crazy vegans—people with 
whom you couldn’t possibly have 
a rational conversation—but they 
will happily inform you that the 
great majority of moral philoso­
phers are vegetarian or vegan. If 
you ask, they will lay out their ar­
guments against animal cruelty. If 
you don’t, they will disrupt your 
shopping or your dinner anyway, 
staging funerals and shouting slo­
gans to strengthen a community.
