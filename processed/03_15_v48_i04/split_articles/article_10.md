New Haven finds simple solutions to unfriendly roads
by Jillian Kravatz
O
n the morning of Sunday, May 1, 2011, residents 
of the Audubon district awoke to find  a bold new 
crosswalk at the intersection of Whitney Avenue and 
Audubon Street. Spray-painted and slightly crooked, 
the rogue act made headlines around town. Opinions 
differed—officials said the sight lines weren’t clear 
enough for a crosswalk, business owners liked that it 
made it easier for people to get to their stores, and 
some just thought it looked a little funny. Useful or 
not, the crosswalk was illegal and officials had the 
paint removed two days later. The impromptu mark­
ings made a point, however: the intersection was dan­
gerous. The city needed to rethink its streets.

Following the deaths of two young pedestrians in 
New Haven in the spring of 2008, residents, elected 
officials, and local organizations established the Safe 
Streets Coalition. The group was formed to advocate 
for streets that are “livable, walkable, bikeable, eco­
nomically viable, environmentally sound, and safe 
for residents of all ages and abilities,” according to 


its website. The coalition launched the Connecticut 
Livable Streets Campaign, which began to lobby for 
local and statewide “complete streets” legislation. By 
July 2009, the legislation, which encourages engi­
neers to implement “traffic calming measures” and 
make “walkability” a priority, had passed in both New 
Haven and the state capital. That year, an education 
campaign called “Street Smarts” launched, inform­
ing Connecticut residents about the safe use of streets. 
It included advice on how to be visible to drivers at 
night and cautioned against dangerous behavior like 
jaywalking. A year later, a small group of New Haven 
engineers created a design manual to help other cit­
ies comply with “complete streets” policies. (The state 
has committed to finishing its own manual by 2017.) 
Still, according to the 2012 DataHaven Community 
Wellbeing Survey, forty-one percent of New Haven 
residents say that their neighborhood is unsafe for bi­
cycling, and nineteen percent say that there are no safe 
sidewalks or crosswalks.   

In response to these safety concerns, a new kind of 
urban planning—the “complete streets” movement—
is underway in New Haven and across the country. The 
idea behind complete streets is simple: roads should 
be built for their users. All of their users, not just driv­
ers. It’s particularly important in a compact urban 
community like New Haven. Mark Abraham, execu­
tive director of DataHaven, reports that nearly thirteen 
percent of workers, around 7,500 residents, say they 
walk to work every day. Roughly three percent, or 
1,500 workers, make their daily commute by bicycle. 
Yet most streets are only designed with the needs of 
drivers in mind, because, despite the new 2009 leg­
islation, state laws generally require that roads maxi­
mize the efficiency of auto traffic. Until recently, the 
Connecticut Department of Transportation was called 
the Connecticut Department of Highways, and many 
advocates still find that it overemphasizes the role of 
automobiles in transportation.

 “You should be designing for the street you want. 
That’s not how most engineering is done,” said Doug 
Hausladen, New Haven’s current director of trans­
portation, traffic, and parking. When Hausladen was 
appointed to the position in 2013, he realized that 
the number of complete streets project proposals sub­
mitted far outpaced his office’s ability to carry them 
out. The proposals, which detail community mem­
bers’ concerns and their proposed solutions, reflect 
the desire for improved streets throughout New Ha­
ven. But Hausladen could only implement about one 


project per year, given budget and time constraints. 
One of the first of these projects was a new cross­
walk across Whitney at the site of the rogue crosswalk. 
Now, the site is decked out with pedestrian-activated 
LED lights that flash to alert drivers when a pedestrian 
is crossing. Curb extensions at the crosswalk shorten 
the width of the street by sixteen feet to make cross­
ing easier for pedestrians, and a speed table—like an 
extended speed bump—forces drivers to slow down 
as they approach the crosswalk. Because of the inter­
section’s layout, the project was complex and costly. It 
took nearly a year, and required a $150,000 subsidy 
from Yale. Its total cost was approximately $320,000. 

But the city doesn’t have enough money to 
spend over a quarter-million dollars per intersection. 
Now, three years after the spray paint was scrubbed 
from Whitney Avenue, Hausladen and City Engineer 
Giovanni Zinn have a more cost-effective plan for re­
thinking the streets of New Haven. It’s called “Com­
plete Streets 2.0,” and it aims to find solutions that are 
inexpensive and easy to implement—solutions that 
actually look a lot more like the spray-painted cross­
walk than the high-tech system of strobe lights and 
other modifications that exists there today.

“This is Mayor Harp and all the complete streets 
activists finally realizing the promise that we made in 
the 2009 legislation,” Hausladen said. The first Com­
plete Streets 2.0 project—a re-design of Edgewood Av­
enue—was announced in November. It is set to reach 
completion in May 2015 at a cost of only $80,000. 
The design reengineers a 2.1-mile stretch of Edge­
wood to accommodate not only automobile traffic, 
but also bicyclists and pedestrians. “We are not afraid 
to rethink the entire space of the roadway,” Hausladen 
said. “Every inch of the roadway is valuable, and we 
can find a way to use it effectively and safely.” 
By using inexpensive materials like paint, delin­
eator tubes, and traffic bollards, Complete Streets 2.0 
aims to increase the number of completed projects to 
at least ten per year, giving community members the 
results they want more quickly. “Granite curb costs 
me forty dollars a foot to install,” explained City Engi­
neer Giovanni Zinn. “A six-inch white line only costs 
me forty cents a foot. I can replace that line many, 
many times before it even gets close to costing what 
a curb would, and we can keep tweaking it until we 
find the best solution,” he added. Complete Streets 2.0 
is unique in its ability to implement projects quickly 
and allow them to “fail fast” if they are ineffective. 
“It leaves room for mistakes, because none of us have 
all of the answers,” said Liam Brennan, a community 
activist and a member of Elm City Cycling, a local 
advocacy group.

But the proposed changes can seem dubious to 
those unfamiliar with the complete streets philoso­
phy. “People understand the low-dollar stuff, but they 
are still a little nervous about me removing a travel 
lane,” Hausladen said, referring to the plans for Edge­
wood Avenue, which will convert a traffic lane into a 
bike lane. “Some of the logic can be counterintuitive,” 
Brenan said. “People might think that wider streets 
means safer streets because no one has explained the 
studies that show that a narrower street causes cars to 
drive slower, which ends up being a safer environ­
ment overall.” And by making it easier for people to 
walk and bicycle, complete streets provide alternatives 
to driving a car, therefore reducing pollution.

Educating the community about complete streets 
is an ongoing challenge for Hausladen and his team. 
Hausladen has a far-reaching idea of what these streets 
can do. According to him, complete streets are the 
right move, not merely because they make cities safer 
and reduce their environmental impact, but because 
complete streets help create a city that is simply a bet­
ter place to live—a vibrant city filled with ideas, ac­
tivities, and thriving businesses. “Community needs 
more humans interacting day to day. Good ideas come 
from conversations,” Hausladen said, explaining that 
people do not have those opportunities for interaction 
in a “carbon community” where everyone is com­
muting in individual cars, cut off from one another.  
Advances in car technology make it increasingly 
easy to travel by vehicle, but the ease comes at a price 
of busier streets and more disconnected city life. It 
turns out the amateur urban planners on Whitney Av­
enue were onto something: sometimes the solution 
to congested streets and dangerous crosswalks can be 
as simple as some white paint. Local voices are calling 
out for better design, but the state’s policies lag be­
hind. Still, Hausladen finds the recent improvements 
to New Haven’s streets encouraging.

“No matter how much amazing transportation 
we have in the future,” he said, “people are still going 
to want to have a more pleasant experience crossing 
the street.”
