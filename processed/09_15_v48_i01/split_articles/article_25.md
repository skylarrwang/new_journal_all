he text came through from an unknown number: 
“Caroline is here.” It had the ring of a pronounce­
ment made by a footman in a Jane Austen novel. But 
Caroline was already here. For one, I was there. At least 
five other Carolines were also there. I surveyed them 
in my living room, tallying them up. Taking roll. Then 
I went to get the door. Because, well, Caroline was 
here. Which is to say, another Caroline was there. The 
other Carolines waited expectantly to sum up the new 
addition to our set. 

With each arrival, we wanted to know how this 
Caroline would fit into the pantheon. How the name-
bearer bore our name, if she would be worthy of a 
glass of mediocre white wine, tolerant of the gluten 
free vegan cookies I had made to please all the vari­
ous versions of her, regardless of her preferences and 
health needs.

For years I dreamed of hosting an exclusive party 
for every Caroline on campus. I had wanted to meet 
them. I had wanted them to meet each other. I had 
wanted to learn their middle names. At the time, I was 
not aware that the Sams of Yale apparently have an an­
nual standing brunch. At last, this evening had come. 
But my efforts were almost thwarted by one of my 
own—“it’s a Rumpus prank,” a certain Caroline had 
told her friend Caroline, starting a rumor that pre­
vented perhaps a dozen Carolines from discovering 
their other selves. Despite this act of betrayal, the eve­
ning of Saturday, March 28 had arrived, and of the 
twenty-six of us at Yale that spring, nine ultimately 
gathered in my Park Street living room. 

At points in my life, I have felt distinctly not Caro­
line. That the name produced a first impression out 
of line with the one I wanted to create. It seemed too 
prim, too Southern. This stance has mellowed since 
coming to college, a moment at which I could have 
switched to another name but chose not to, mostly 
for the sake of simplicity. I wondered if this evening 
would affirm my decision to remain in the league 
of Carolines.        

Now gathered, when our language mirrored one 
another’s, and it often did, so too would our actions. 
“Caroline” someone would say, and we would all 
turn. In a setting where we were reminded constantly 
that we were Caroline, in every encounter our very 
Caroline-ness was questioned. One Caroline, upon re­
ceiving my email, subject line: “Hello Caroline,” ini­
tially thought it was an email from herself.   

As if seeking to extrapolate my influence in the 
Caroline hierarchy, I constantly did the math on at­
tendees and no-shows. Three Carolines were tied up at 
the Whim concert (two performing, one watching), 
and one wrote to me in advance to apologize for be­
ing out of town, leaving thirteen who were either too 
busy, too cool, or too scared to show up. To those who 
were too scared: should there be a next time, please 
come! To those who were too cool: you are a disgrace 
to your name. If Caroline falls from the Gawker’s rank­
ings of popular Yale names and our numbers dwindle, 
don’t seek solidarity with me. 

You see, as it turned out, the Carolines of Yale do 
in fact have commonalities extending beyond the first 
letter of our net ID. For one, we were all white—an 
uncomfortable, Freakonmics-in-the-wild realization. 
Even with this small sample size, we nearly confirmed 
the inkling that we were on the whole slightly more 
southern than the general Yale population. I anticipat­
ed that discussion would migrate away from Caroline-
centric topics toward standard getting-to-know-you 
discussions, but this never really occurred. After the 
obviously streamlined introductions, conversations 
gravitated back to our established common ground. 
This micro-smalltalk was more amusing and personal 
than garden-variety conversations with strangers. 
Somehow, the opportunities to discuss the impact 
of growing up Caroline never dwindled. We debated 
“Sweet Caroline” versus “Roses” (Neil Diamond beat 
out Outkast by a narrow margin) and the fact that 
Carolyn just isn’t Caroline. It would be unfair to argue 
that anything profound happened in that period of 
just over an hour. A random set of Yale students came 
together on the basis of a chance common denomi­
nator. Yale loves to do this to us, we love to do this to 
ourselves, the cycle continues. We were not so similar 
as to reveal an obvious underlying commonality, pre­
viously invisible outside of this context. Yet, neither 
were we so different that one looking hard enough at 
the Rorschach test of my living room couldn’t come 
up with some generalized conclusions.   

We arranged my laptop for a photo booth picture. 
Unfortunately, no Carolines came prepared with a 
selfie-stick. We invented a hand sign for the occasion: 
double Cs, crossed, Chanel-like, a symbol of our new­
found kinship. Later, on Facebook, someone I don’t 
know would comment on the picture: “I think its re­
ally awesome that yer in the nerdy girl frat.” Well. At 
the very least, we seemed to be friends, and I guess 
that’s saying something, given that many of us were 
complete strangers less than an hour before the flash 
went off.   

Soon after, a Caroline had to go. Once the set had 
broken, the appeal of lingering dwindled. But each of 
us would turn the next time we heard our name called 
now able to imagine at least eight others who might 
respond, knowing that in this encounter we were the 
intended Caroline.
