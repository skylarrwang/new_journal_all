tary to campus as just part of the larger process of 
Yale rediscovering this spirit of service that has ex­
isted since Yale’s founding. Berg cites the example 
of Nathan Hale—the famous Yale alumnus who 
was executed for spying on the British during the 
Revolutionary War. 
“If you’d have asked him to scrub toilets for his 
country, he would have scrubbed toilets because, as 
he said, anything done in service of one’s country 
becomes noble in the execution,” Lukas said. “I think 
that’s part of Yale’s heritage.”

This heritage has not always been embraced. 
When military history professor Paul Kennedy ar­
rived at Yale in the 1980s, he remembers a “distinctly 
anti-military culture.” Fueled by anti-Vietnam sen­
timents and concern about the military’s policies 
towards women and LGBTQ people, the majority 
of the student body and faculty saw the military as 
an institution that was fundamentally incompatible 
with Yale’s espoused liberal arts values. 

But time has mitigated many of these concerns. 
“As I see it, there’s been a rebalancing of attitudes at 
Yale, and it’s found itself happening when you could 
say there’s also been a rebalancing of public opinion 
about the military,” Kennedy said.

This new tone has impacted the classroom dy­
namic, allowing for friendlier conversation, accord­
ing to many of the military personnel interviewed for 
this article. Students and teachers alike are far more 
accepting of ROTC’s presence than in decades past. 
Still, Yale’s reputation since the 1970s as an anti-mil­
itary school has caused some of the military recruits 
to approach with apprehension.

Lieutenant Colonel Charles Faint, for example, 
said, “I’m in the military, I’m from the South, I’m 
conservative, and I had no desire to go to what I per­
ceived was going to be an anti-military, anti-South­
ern, gun-hating state and college where I’d just never 
lived before…I was envisioning fist fights with the 
hippies on the green.” 

Faint came to Yale on the Army’s dime in 2011 
to get a master’s degree in Global Affairs so that he 
could return to West Point to teach social studies. 
Though he was not initially interested in attending 
Yale, the presence of General McChrystal—whom he 
worked under in the Joint Special Operations Com­
mand—led him to reconsider. While the atmosphere 
was not as anti-military as he anticipated, he soon 
realized that misconceptions went both ways. “They 
assumed because I’m a white hetero Christian male 
from the South that I’d be anti-gay, that I’d have racial 
animosity…It really was a mutual growing process 
across the two years,” he said.  

Despite the perception that Yale and the military 
make for strange bedfellows, most veterans I talked 
to said the transition from military life to the Uni­
versity was much smoother than they expected. Faint 
attributes this to the nature of academic debate. “We 
could have a knock-down drag-out fight in the class­
room and we’d all be downtown drinking beers af­
terwards,” he said. 

Professor Emma Sky, who teaches seminars on 
the Iraq War and Modern Middle Eastern politics, of­
fered a similar rationale. “The classroom is a safe en­
vironment where people can get to know each other,” 
she explained. “It doesn’t matter if the person is a 
colonel or lieutenant colonel, in the classroom every­
body is equal.” Though her courses are consistently 
oversubscribed, she preferentially admits former ser­
vicemen and women, because she thinks they intro­
duce a valuable perspective about the conflict.

But these positive experiences may also reflect a 
certain degree of self-selection. Many veterans who 
come to Yale pursue fields in which military experi­
ence is valued, such as management, global affairs, or 
area studies. What may be true in these fields might 
not hold consistently across disciplines. 

Adam Keller is a master’s student in the English 
department. He was in Afghanistan in 2012 when he 
received an email from his West Point English teacher, 
a Yale alumna, who encouraged him to get a gradu­
ate degree so that he could come back to West Point 
and teach. After three deployments, both Keller and 
his family were looking for a respite from the con­
stant uncertainty of active duty, so he applied and was 
accepted to Yale’s English literature terminal master’s 
program. Unlike many other Yale veterans, Keller’s 
course of study is a less obvious fit with his mili­
tary background. And unlike his peers, Keller says he 
encountered some hostility from his professors 
and classmates. 

“I know that there were members of the faculty 
who didn’t agree with the fact that I am here,” he 
said. “[There’s] the idea that what I do for a living is 
not consistent with the types of values a humanities 
education is supposed to inculcate.” 

Keller thinks some of the opposition is a mani­
festation of academic insularity—he is the only one 
of his cohort not pursuing a long-term career in tra­
ditional English academia—but he thinks the prima­
ry bent of the animosity is ideological. 

“Yale College still feels more foreign than Afghan­
istan,” he said.

If you saw Ben Shaver in Book Trader Cafe, with 
his mop of untidy curls and oversized tortoiseshell 
glasses, you probably wouldn’t guess that he’s a for­
mer Marine— he looks like he belongs in Brooklyn, 
not Baghdad. Shaver enlisted in the Marines in 2005, 
immediately after high school. After almost five years 
working in linguistics and intelligence in Iraq, he re­
turned stateside to get a college degree. He spent two 
years at Deep Springs—a two-year, alternative col­
lege in California—and then transferred into Yale’s 
Eli Whitney program for non-traditional students. 
Shaver thinks that Yale’s rejuvenated discourse with 
the military is not as comprehensive as it purports 
to be, because it includes few of the largely working-
class people who put their bodies on the line to carry 
out American foreign policy.

The overwhelming majority of servicemen and 
women on Yale’s campus today are or were members 
of the officer corps, and ROTC graduates follow the 
same path. The officer corps accounts for only 16.4 
percent of the United States military. Enlisted soldiers 
comprise the other 83.6 percent of the United States 
military, and only 5.9 percent of them have a Bach­
elor’s degree or higher.

“To speak of a veteran community at Yale with­
in the undergrad population—it just doesn’t exist,” 
Shaver said. “There are people in the grad schools, 
but they’re not at all representative of the military…
They’re the elite within the command of the military, 
and they’re careerist. Their perspective is different—
they’ve bought in.” 

There are currently over one million American 
college students paying their tuition with GI Bill ben­
efits, but you won’t find many of these veterans at 
élite institutions. According to the New York Times, in 
the 2013-2014 academic year, Brown University 
housed only eleven undergraduate veterans of the 
American armed services; Harvard, four; and Princ­
eton, one. Though Yale will not release the number 
of veterans in the undergraduate community, those 
I talked to were confident that you could count the 
number on one hand.

Why aren’t there more enlisted veterans at Yale? 
Part of the answer may lie in demographics. More 
than sixty percent of student veterans are first-gen­
eration college students, compared to roughly twelve 
percent of Yale students. According to the most re­
cently available Department of Defense statistics, in 
2007, 42.97 percent of enlisted military recruits 
came from the Southeast and 12.81 percent from the 
Northeast. In comparison, fifteen percent of Yale’s 
class of 2018 is from the Southeast, up to forty-one 
percent from the Northeast. The geographic regions 
from which Yale and the military draw are almost ex­
act inverses of each other.

Shaver thinks his admission to Yale doesn’t nec­
essarily reflect what the reality for most enlisted vet­
erans. “It’s about class dynamics. A big part of the 
military going to college afterwards, these are people 
who probably wouldn’t have gone to college other­
wise. That’s not really my experience…For me it was 
more like I was resuming what would have been my 
life trajectory outside of the military,” he explained.  

Though Yale has made some effort to recruit such 
veterans, for instance, by mailing admissions bro­
chures to the honors societies of community colleges 
and by sending a recruiter to the local Marine base, 
these measures have not amounted to much so far. 
“It’s easy for Harvard or Yale to get complacent 
or content that they have plenty of vets on campus 
just because they have former officers at the business 
school, and nobody really talks about the fact that 
the top schools are doing a not so great job of going 
out and finding the enlisted veterans,” said Jesse Reis­
ing. As a Yale undergraduate, Reising was set to enter 
the Marine Corps upon graduation, but a debilitating 
football injury during his senior year Harvard–Yale 
Game rendered him medically ineligible. Because he 
could not serve, Reising wanted to find another way 
to engage with the military. 

He co-founded the Warrior-Scholar Project, now 
a nationwide academic boot camp designed to ease 
the transition of enlisted veterans to civilian universi­
ties. As part of the Warrior-Scholar Project, veterans 
sleep in Saybrook College dorm rooms, attend classes 
taught by notable Yale professors, and participate in 
panels run by the Yale Admissions Office on the col­
lege application process. Reising thinks that Yale and 
other élite universities can do better. “If someone 
told [veterans] it was possible to go to a top school, 
they could do it. They just need to be told they can,” 
he stated. 

Earlier last semester, I spent a chilly February 
afternoon walking around campus with a group 
of West Point cadets. One of the cadets on the walk 
was sporting a black eye and a set of electric blue 
stitches from an injury sustained during training; 
another was wearing large, black medical sunglasses 
because he had recently undergone Lasik eye surgery 
(20/40 uncorrected vision is required to apply to 
be a military pilot). The cadets’ commanding officer 
was a wiry man in an olive green beret who walked 
with a pronounced limp—the remnant of an old 
battlefield injury. 

Walking around campus with these men in uni­
form, I could feel the curious eyes that followed us. 
One friend jokingly asked what I had done to merit 
such an escort. At the gawtes of Old Campus, another 
group of students came up to ask if the cadets were 
part of the security retinue of some famous person 
visiting campus. Neither of these interactions was 
hostile, but the sight of a large group of people in 
uniform certainly did not go unnoticed. 

Had this been 1946, the cadets could have been 
marching in formation with rifles and nobody would 
have batted an eye. Had this been 1970, the cadets 
would have been targeted by vitriolic protesters. But 
in 2015, the West Point cadets were simply here visit­
ing General McChrystal’s leadership course.

An explosive Rolling Stone article spurred McChrys­
tal’s resignation as the U.S. commander in Afghani­
stan, but the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs in­
vited him to teach at Yale in the wake of the political 
controversy. McChrystal is indicative of the Univer­
sity’s embrace of high-profile military personnel. He 
is now in his fifth year at Yale, and he looks at home 
in his third-floor Hillhouse office. 

When I ask him what role he thinks the military 
recruits play on Yale’s campus today, he answers im­
mediately. “I think they are harbinger of a new future 
at Yale University. I think there’s a different mindset 
growing,” he says. “It’s going to take a while, but I 
“THERE IS THE GERMINATION 
OF THE IDEA OF SERVICE.”
