Even dogs take tests at Yale 

Zoe the chocolate lab stares at the two overturned 
white buckets on the other side of the room. A 
screen is placed in front of the buckets, blocking her 
view, and a treat is placed under one of the buckets. 
But which one? The dog strains against her leash, her 
tail twitching uncontrollably. As the screen rises, she 
rushes toward the buckets. Researcher Rebecca Spaulding points emphatically to the correct container, but 
Zoe ignores her gesture. She turns to the other bucket, 
trying desperately to overturn it with her large brown 
nose. It slides only a few inches across the smooth 
floor. Why doesn’t Zoe respond to the pointing? 

This scene plays out just behind Science Hill in a 
tiny white building visited by dogs from across the 
tri-state area. The Canine Cognition Center (CCC) 
opened a year and a half ago as part of Yale’s Comparative Cognition Lab. “Our center is devoted to learning 
more about canine psychology—how dogs perceive 
their environment, solve problems, and make decisions,” Laurie Santos, the CCC’s director, wrote in an 
email. Scientists already know that both nature and 
nurture play a role in development, but the question 
is how much “nurture”—or environment—matters.

The researchers refer to their test subjects as “dog 
scientists” on the CCC’s website, but they caution the 
leash-holders against believing that dogs always understand what’s going on. Even so, the owners tend 
to become invested in the experiments’ outcomes. “I 
am always rooting for her to do well!” laughs Theresa 
Schenker, Zoe’s owner, who said she hoped the research would give her a chance to bond with her pet. 

In the laboratory’s curious social dynamic, owners 
must be instructed to sit with their heads down and 
eyes closed to avoid giving helpful cues while their 
barking counterparts are put to the test. 

For all the big questions the researchers try to answer, the laboratory building is surprisingly small.
