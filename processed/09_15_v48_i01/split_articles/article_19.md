Nora is anxiously awaiting a package. She is lying 
on her bed in her suite when she finally gets 
the USPS delivery notice on her iPhone. After class 
that afternoon, she picks up a bulky envelope from 
the Yale post office. Two of her friends are already 
waiting for her back in the suite. They eye the 
package impatiently.
	
“Moment of truth,” one of them says.
 	
Nora rips open the pouch and removes a small, 
lilac box tied with pale purple ribbon. She flips off the 
top to reveal a dinky beaded bracelet.
