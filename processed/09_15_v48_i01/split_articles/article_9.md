With plaster and paint, New Haven students chronicle injustice

Ruby slowly peels the tape off her canvas, exposing 
turquoise and red between the stripes of black running down the painting. 
“I don’t usually use black because it seems too harsh, 
but this time it seemed right,” she says.
Ruby is one of eighteen New Haven high school students of color participating in Artspace’s fifteenth annual 
Summer Apprenticeship Program. Artspace is a nonprofit 
in New Haven’s Ninth Square neighborhood that connects emerging artists with audiences in the New Haven 
community. Every year brings a new topic for the apprenticeship program, and this year the aim is to include 
the young participants in a growing conversation on race 
in the American justice system. For three weeks in July, 
the students take over the gallery and turn the exhibition 
space into workshops. Some students were encouraged to 
apply to the Artspace program by teachers at their schools. 
Others saw the program advertised on the street. On the 
application form, students were asked to explain their interest in the program and whether or not their family had 
any personal encounters with the criminal justice system. 
Many of them said yes. 

Throughout the summer, I worked in the offices of 
Artspace and watched the students influence the rhythms 
and energy of the building. Earlier in the summer, a busy 
day at the gallery often meant three visitors over the 
course of one afternoon. Now, at the end of the summer while the exhibition is up, the gallery attracts around 
twenty people each day. 

The students worked with Aaron Jafferis and Dexter Singleton from New Haven’s Collective Consciousness Theatre on poetry, songs, and skits. Lead Artist Titus 
Kaphar, who received his MFA at Yale in 2006, instructed 
students in visual art. Kaphar’s own work draws on and 
reappropriates the art historical canon, often to explore 
themes of racism and black experiences.
 “The thing I am good at, if I’m good at anything, is 
helping people to take the seed of an idea, and water it, 
and grow that into a larger project,” Kaphar says of his 
teaching approach. Over the course of the program, the 
teenagers speak with ex-convicts, visit a level-four correctional facility, and learn about the history of racism and 
the criminal justice system. After each activity, they return 
to Artspace to process their experiences through art. 

Before coming up with the idea for her painting, 
Ruby recalled a day when she had gone straight from 
a correctional facility to her job at New Haven’s Union 
League Café. A morning defined by deprivation followed 
by an evening submerged in excess. The next day, she approached Kaphar with a burning idea for a new direction 
in her art. 

At the workshop, Ruby’s piece was bare except for 
a wash of indigo blue with turquoise squares here and 
there. She mentions the unexpected similarity between 
her trip to the prison and her job as a waitress. In those 
spaces, customers and prisoners both expect silence 
from her. She and Kaphar discuss the parallels between 
the men behind bars with whom she was not allowed 
to talk, and the men at tables, whom she was supposed 
to serve silently. He suggests “dichotomy” as a word to 
formulate her ideas. 
“Yeah! Like between these two worlds,” she says.
“Absolutely,” he replied. “Art is made in that space 
in between.”
In 2013, Kaphar created The Jerome Project, a series 
of ninety-nine portraits of men in the prison system 
who share the historically black name of his father. The 
students’ show shares the same name as his exhibit and 
culminated in the joint display of their work beside that 
of established artists. Kaphar’s work has always focused 
on themes of racial disparity, but only within the past 
year has it earned attention for its message.
 “A lot of people ask, ‘Do you think that your art 
can, like, change the world in a way?’” he said. “I don’t 
think that in general people walk up to a painting, and 
their lives are changed. I don’t think that that’s what 
happens. But I think that the kinds of conversations that 
happen around paintings—those can have an impact 
on society.”
On the night of the student opening, Ruby’s piece 
hung on the wall—the turquoise background now held 
concentric squares of red, purple, and grey. The black 
lines contrasted starkly with the other warmer colors. 
People trickled in before the show formally opened. By 
the time the students were performing the poetry, skits, 
and songs they had created, the room was full. 

From the front desk, I watched a crowd that far 
exceeded what I had come to expect at Artspace events 
filter through the galleries. For hours, some four hundred people from across New Haven gathered together, 
murmuring as they lingered over Ruby’s piece and over 
others, their voices rising in discussion as they left.
