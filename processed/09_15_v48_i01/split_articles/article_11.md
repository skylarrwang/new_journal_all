many dogs troop in and out over the course of the 
day, sometimes leading to confusion. “Wait,” Spauld­
ing says at one point, while looking at the whiteboard 
with the list of dogs coming in. “Is Zoe the dog or 
the owner?” Upon closer examination, we confirmed 
that Zoe is a dog. “We keep getting dogs with people 
names,” she explains in the lab’s office. 

In keeping with this theme, I observe Lily, a large 
black poodle whose tightly curled fur is adorned with 
bright pink rubber bands. She pants and tugs at the 
leash held by her owner, Catherine Kelly, who sports 
a black T-shirt decorated with a bejeweled poodle. 
Kelly straightens her glasses on her nose as she apolo­
gizes for the state of Lily’s unkempt fur. “She has all 
these clumps here! I need to take her to the groom­
er,” she says, attempting to smooth down the black 
curls. Lily pants happily, unfazed, and examines my 
hands for treats.

 “We’re going to have three parts to your visit to­
day,” Spaulding explains to Kelly. “First, we’ll have Lily 
warm up and get some easy treats. Then we’ll do the 
first test, where we’ll hide a treat and see where Lily 
chooses to look for it. Next, we’ll present Lily a scene 
with certain cues and see how she responds.” Kelly 
and Lily enter the testing room as Spaulding switches 
on a television screen in the waiting room. A live cam­
era feed appears, allowing me to watch Lily’s session.

The tests are often derived from experiments that 
comparative psychologists give to monkeys or ba­
bies. But dogs come in all shapes and sizes, and the 
tests must sometimes be customized to take that into 
account. “The difference between a very small Chi­
huahua and a large Bernese mountain dog is huge, 
and setting up the same things for both of those dogs 
will get different results,” says Linda Chang, the lab’s 
manager at the time. This trial-and-error process is 
complicated by the fact that, unlike human subjects, 
“dogs can’t tell you what they found confusing, and 
they can’t tell you what they thought was hard. So you 
have to take your best guess,” Spaulding explains. As a 
result, the researchers must often repeat the same test 
for months with many dogs. 

Soon after Lily and Kelly leave, Mary Coates ar­
rives with her dog Logan, a golden retriever who 
lumbers over like a friendly bear and grunts happily 
when I reach over to rub his back. He and Coates are 
led into the study room, and I watch on the screen as 
the familiar treat-hiding scenes play out with Logan. 
All I can see of Logan is his large nose at the bottom 
left of the screen, pointing attentively at the white 
buckets in front of him. Occasionally, he turns back to 
Coates for reassurance, but she follows the rules and 
keeps her eyes averted.

Despite some test results like Zoe’s, Santos says 
that after months of conducting the pointing test, the 
researchers have found that most dogs do respond to 
human pointing gestures. Michael Bogese, the lab’s 
current manager, explained to me that the ability to 
recognize human gestures is uncommon among ani­
mals. “Indeed, even our closest living relatives, chim­
panzees, are very bad at the task,” Bogese says. But the 
CCC researchers still need to figure out which types 
of pointing dogs pay attention to, and the extent to 
which our gestures influence their decisions. 

The “dog scientists” of Yale’s CCC are just happy 
to get treats, but in the meantime their owners are 
watching to see whether they measure up. They sit in 
the next room, hoping that their pup will be the one 
to prove dogs’ emotional genius. “I just know Logan 
thinks and understands,” Coates says after the tests are 
done. “And I love being part of something that vali­
dates that.”
