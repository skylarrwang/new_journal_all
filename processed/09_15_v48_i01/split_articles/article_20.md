“It’s not really my aesthetic,” she jokes, and tosses 
it on the couch. She removes the thin layer of foam 
on which the bracelet had rested. Underneath, a small 
packet wrapped in paper is taped down to the base.
She wrestles the packet free and unwraps the 
paper, revealing a stack of six pairs of South Carolina 
driver’s licenses. She locates the pair meant for her.
“Wow—these look legit,” she says, inspecting the 
scanning strip on the back and flicking the card’s ho­
lographic face in and out of the light. She splays the 
other ten cards out on the table so her friends can 
pick out their likenesses. Sitting down on her couch, 
she grabs her laptop and pulls up an image of a state-
issued South Carolina ID. Everything—the color and 
font scheme, the picture placements, the ZIP code 
format—matches perfectly. The personal information 
and photo match those on her ID from her home 
state. The name on the South Carolina card, however, 
is a pseudonym, and two years have been subtracted 
from her date of birth. On her real driver’s license, 
Nora is twenty. Nora from Columbia, South Carolina, 
is twenty-one. 

She searches her new address on Google, trying 
to memorize where it is on a map. A housing ap­
praisal pops up on Zillow.
“Ninety-two thousand dollars—I’m a broke 
bitch!” she laughs.
Three weeks prior, Nora had visited the West­
ern Union kiosk at the Walgreens on York Street and 
transferred six hundred dollars—plus a fourteen-
dollar fee—to an account in Guangzhou, China. She 
and five other friends had already submitted their 
personal information, along with photos taken 
against a white wall in a college basement, to a 
website recommended by a freshman acquaintance. 
The order had taken longer than the eighteen-day 
shipping time listed on the site, but the product did 
not disappoint.
“I want to try it tonight!” she said, dismissing her 
friends’ grousing about their approaching final exams. 
Later that evening, I accompany Nora to Barracu­
da, a Latin-inspired bar on the corner of Chapel and 
Elm. We settle in at a booth, and Nora flags down a 
waitress to take her order.
“Can I see your ID?” she asks nicely. Nora slides 
her South Carolina driver’s license across the table. 
The waitress gives the card a quick once-over and 
hands it back.
A few minutes later, she returns with a mango-
infused mojito. As she turns away, Nora cracks a smile. 
Of all the illicit activity on campus, the use of 
fake IDs is probably among the most prevalent and 
least scrutinized. According to a survey conducted 
by the Dean’s Office in the 2011–’12 academic year, 
Yale students drink more than the average American 
college student. But there’s an astonishing lack of 
people—university-employed or otherwise—tell­
ing us that buying false identification might be a 
bad idea. We never receive any administrative emails 
about fake IDs, and as a Branford freshman counselor 
told me, they are not a required topic for Freshman 
Orientation and fro-co meetings. 

I wanted to understand why the phenomenon 
of fake IDs is being ignored in the Yale–New Haven 
community, and to better grasp the impacts of a tacit 
culture of acceptance. At the beginning of February 
2015, I began sending a Google survey to students in 
three randomly selected residential colleges: Morse, 
Pierson, and Saybrook. I asked fifteen questions that 
ranged from whether students had ever purchased 
a fake, to the price they paid and how they got it, to 
whether they had ever faced disciplinary action for 
using one. Over the course of two months, I emailed 
the survey to 1,078 students, allowing participants 
to remain anonymous if they chose. My goal was not 
to get dead-accurate statistics, but rather a general 
understanding of fakes at Yale.

Of the 230 students who responded to my 
survey, eighty-four, or approximately thirty-seven 
percent, reported that they had purchased a fake ID, a 
figure that was relatively consistent across the three 
colleges. The majority of respondents acquired their 
IDs during their freshman year or, in about a third of 
cases, while they were still in high school. Roughly 
a quarter purchased them on websites in the same 
way Nora did. Many students organized bulk orders 
among their friends or Greek organizations in order 
to take advantage of online discounts. 

Students pay a wide range of prices for fake 
IDs, some shelling out as little as twenty dollars or 
as much as 160 for a pair, in case one gets lost or 
taken by a bouncer. But the price that Nora paid was 
consistent with what most people spend for a quality 
card—properly laminated so that it doesn’t look or 
feel flimsy, outfitted with a convincing hologram and 
a data strip that will scan reliably at clubs and liquor 
stores that are strict about checking for minors. 

In addition to online sources, many students said 
that they acquired their IDs through friends who 
did not go to Yale, or “other” sources—often older 
friends or siblings who passed on their IDs after 
turning twenty-one. Thirty-five percent, however, re­
ported that they obtained one from another student. 
Several sources identified a Yale student who acted 
as an intermediary for them two years ago, relaying 
orders to a dealer in New York and ferrying fake IDs 
back to Yale in exchange for a small commission. 

I interviewed thirteen students and survey re­
spondents to get a sense of how the Yale–New Haven 
community participates in this increasingly sophis­
ticated marketplace. Those conversations made clear 
that a culture of permissibility at every disciplinary 
level has afforded the Yale student body a cavalier, if 
naïve, disregard for the law. Yale students routinely 
put themselves in positions that could theoreti­
cally land them in jail, and they often do so with 
surprisingly little forethought. These interviews also 
revealed a story of larger dysfunction, about how 
slippery fault becomes when it belongs to everyone 
and no one, and of what can go wrong when you 
only have to pass for twenty-one to drink in the state 
of Connecticut. 

“Most people don’t buy fakes to buy alcohol,” 
Amelia, a junior, said. “Most people buy fakes to 
access spaces.”
As students get older, the social scene can shift 
from dorm parties to off-campus bars. For people 
under twenty-one who want to branch out from the 
archetypal college party scene of keg stands and beer 
pong, the options can be limiting without a fake ID. 
While twenty-seven percent of those who responded 
to my questionnaire said that they used their fake IDs 
most often at liquor stores, the majority of respon­
dents—sixty-five percent—used them to enter bars 
and clubs.
Jane, a member of a sorority, bought a fake ID in 
part because of the social exclusion she says is cre­
ated by the drinking age. 

“At [sorority] formal, there will be a twenty-
one-plus area, and a lot of my friends are going to 
be in that area, and I want to be able to hang out 
with them at my event … that I paid for,” she said. 
“There’s an unnecessary divide in a social scene where 
I’m not allowed to hang out with my older friends.”
Katie, who has a late August birthday, expressed 
similar frustrations and discussed buying a fake ID 
while interning in Manhattan last summer, even 
though she rarely drank. Like Jane, Katie felt that the 
social freedom that comes with a fake ID was more 
important than access to alcohol itself. 

But while there are easier, more prudent ways of 
getting alcohol at Yale than purchasing it in a store, 
there is also a sense that a fake ID gives people more 
control over what they drink. Nora, for example, has 
every intention of using her fake ID at liquor stores.	
At a frat party, she’s at the mercy of whoever is 
pouring drinks, she explained, “whereas if it’s my 
bottle of [Grey] Goose, I know where it came from.” 
Nora made another common claim: drinking in 
designated public spaces tends to be less conducive 
to binge drinking, as bartenders are trained to rec­
ognize when customers are too intoxicated. “When 
you drink at a frat,” Nora said, “there’s no one who’s 
going to say, ‘No, you’ve had too much, go home.’” 
While there are sometimes Communication and 
Consent Educators and friendly bystanders at college 
parties, the risk of unmonitored drinking is higher.
But there’s also a more defiant element behind 
students’ eagerness to obtain fakes, an implicit belief 
that the law is simply not worth observing. Underly-
