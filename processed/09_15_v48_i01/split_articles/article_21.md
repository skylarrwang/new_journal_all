ing students’ commentary was a blatant contempt for 
the drinking age.
“I think we’re a little bit backwards,” Nora said of 
the United States, comparing its drinking age with 
that of Israel and European countries. “Obviously, 
I don’t think 15-, 16-year-olds, should be drink­
ing. But I’m an adult. I’ve worked, I’m experiencing 
some semblance of the real world … I can legally 
drive a car—I can kill someone with a car if I’m 
not careful,” she said. “I’m an adult in every aspect 
of my life.” 
John, who acquired his ID in high school, views 
the drinking age the same way. “It feels stupid,” he 
said. “It feels inane.”
Regardless of where and how they planned to 
use them, many students bought fake IDs simply as a 
logical extension of the existing culture.
“We’re already drinking, whether in [dorm] 
rooms or restaurants and bars,” Nora said. “It’s still 
happening. It’s constantly a game of remembering 
where will serve us. I can acquire booze already, so I 
just don’t want to play that game anymore.” 
Now is probably the time for a disclaimer: I 
don’t own a fake ID, nor have I ever seriously con­
sidered buying one. I’d like to say it’s because I’m a 
highly principled person, but more realistically it’s 
because I’ve never been very good at lying. There 
were certainly Friday nights during my freshman 
year when, pint of Ben & Jerry’s in hand, I wished 
I could have been at a chic bar with my upperclass­
men friends, but it was always the nebulous legal 
implications of buying a fake ID, and not the moral 
ones, that gave me pause.
As it turns out, many Yale students don’t see 
ownership of a fake ID as a moral lapse either. Of 
the 146 people in my survey who did not own fakes, 
only four said that a respect for the law or moral 
principle was their reason for not buying one.  
“I don’t like breaking rules. I don’t even down­
load illegal movies,” said one student who owns a 
fake. “But it’s so normal here for people to have fake 
IDs that it just feels like there’s nothing wrong 
with it.”
Regardless of one’s opinions on the matter, 
though, denying that the law carries any moral 
weight is still quite different from actively defying 
legal authority. When I first started interviewing Yale 
students, I thought that the insouciance with which 
they skirt the law was perhaps rooted in a sense that 
going to Yale, or more generally being in a college 
town, offers them protection. Financial resources 
must also play into that sense of entitlement, because 
while most Yale students have little patience for what 
they perceive as draconian drinking laws, not all of 
them can afford to break them. And when certain 
strains of false licenses begin to group themselves 
into distinct brands, peppering the campus like de­
signer sunglasses, fake ID ownership can sometimes 
seem like the exclusive province of the wealthy.
But while it would have been easy after talking 
to these students to reduce fake ID ownership to 
the cliché of Ivy-League entitlement, that explana­
tion fails to account for the scope of what appears 
to be a nationwide issue. A 2007 study published in 
Psychology of Addictive Behaviors showed that at a large, 
unnamed Midwestern state university, thirty-two 
percent of the student body possessed a fake ID by 
their sophomore spring, suggesting that Yale is by no 
means unique.

Most students’ disregard for the legal conse­
quences of owning a fake was due not so much to 
complacency as to ignorance. Twenty-nine percent of 
survey respondents who lacked a fake ID cited a fear 
of legal or administrative repercussions as their rea­
son for not buying one. But of the thirteen students 
I interviewed, only John had fully researched the 
potential consequences before purchasing his. 
Though some said that they probably should have

looked into it more, most students blithely ac­
knowledged that their understanding of the issue 
originated largely from hearsay. One student said she 
had “no idea” what the legal fallout of owning a fake 
could be. 
According to Seth Garbarsky, a Connecticut state 
attorney, flouting the Connecticut Liquor Control 
Act with a fake ID normally constitutes a low-class 
misdemeanor, for which the potential maximum 
sentence is a five-hundred-dollar fine and thirty days 
of jail time. Few students are aware of these potential 
consequences, but perhaps the absence of a collective 
understanding about how fake ID use is punished 
confirms that such understanding is unnecessary. Of 
the eighty-four students who admitted having fake 
IDs in my survey, only three reported getting in any 
kind of trouble beyond refusal of entry or sale. 
For instance, Carmen was drinking margaritas 
at Viva Zapata, a Mexican eatery, her freshman year 
when New Haven police raided the restaurant. When 
an officer demanded to see her ID, Carmen panicked 
and handed over her fake, a Rhode Island license 
she had purchased through a student intermediary. 
The officer could tell that the card, which lacked the 
convincing hologram of more expensive IDs, wasn’t 
real, but she was generous: Carmen admitted that 
it was counterfeit, and in the end the officer only 
charged her for underage drinking—an infraction, 
not a misdemeanor.
Carmen was offered the option of paying a fine 
of under two hundred dollars and having the charge 
remain on her driving record, or doing community 
service. Even though she doesn’t have an American 
driver’s license, since she is an international student, 
she wanted to ensure that any charges were dropped. 
She hired a lawyer who secured her twenty hours of 
community service, which she fulfilled at a nearby 
soup kitchen over the course of three months. She 
never had to appear in court, and she never told 
her parents. 
William F. Dow III, the lawyer Carmen hired, 
gets five to ten such cases every year, the majority of 
which involve Yale students. Dow said that arrange­
ments like Carmen’s are typical. 
“[Students] are given a citation, and they either 
pay a fine, or oftentimes if the prosecutor is gener­
ous, he or she will allow them to perform hours of 
community service in exchange for dropping the 
case,” Dow said. 
Garbarsky told me that the charges in fake ID 
cases are up to the discretion of the prosecutor. Why, 
then, isn’t the punishment more severe?
“It’s because it’s a nuisance crime,” Dow said. 
“The participants tend to be young, and unless there 
are extreme circumstances, it’s a recognition of the 
realities of life.” In most cases, prosecutors are will­
ing to accept a “reasonable” amount of community 
service—anywhere from ten to forty hours.
Some people I interviewed were concerned that 
the consequences could be worse for international 
students like Carmen, who could be thought of as 
impersonating an American citizen. But Jeffrey Alker 
Meyer, a federal court judge for the state of Con­
necticut, said that it is “very unlikely” that federal 
prosecutors would charge a college student who 
used a fake in the way Camen did. When I asked 
Dow whether student cases could escalate, he told 
me that I was making too big of a deal. “Underage 
kids drinking [is the crime], O.K.?”
So, as with underage drinking itself, it seems that 
students can afford to be ignorant about fake ID laws 
because they are so rarely relevant. In cases where 
New Haven police are not involved, Yale also tends to 
be permissive. In the 2011–’12 academic year, Yale 
Police found fourteen undergraduates who had pur­
chased alcohol with a fake ID at liquor stores or used 
one to gain access to Toad’s Place. In all but one case 
(in which the student had a previous disciplinary 
history), the only punishment was confiscation of 
the ID and a reprimand—the administrative equiva­
lent of a slap on the wrist. 
Jane, who purchased her fake ID in high school, 
was caught at the beginning of freshman year as she 
was exiting a liquor store with a bottle of wine. Both 
her infraction and her misdemeanor charges were 
dropped after she completed twenty-five hours of 
community service. Unlike Carmen, though, Jane 
was caught by Yale Police officers, and as a result 
was required to sit before Yale’s Executive Commit­
tee. She said that the disposition, in which she was 
pointedly questioned about how her parents raised 
her to approach alcohol and whether she intended to 
drink again before she was twenty-one, proved more 
intimidating than her court hearing. 
“They definitely try and scare you,” she said of 
the disciplinary process. “But you’re not going to 
get suspended. They recognize that there are enough 
people here [with fakes] that it’s not worth com­
pletely screwing over someone’s future because of it.”
Jane was also assigned to talk at Yale–New 
Haven Hospital with an alcohol counselor, who 
stopped their meetings after a preliminary session 
and follow-up. Jane said she thought the counseling 
was simply a way for Yale to cover its bases. (Pamela 
George, the secretary of the Executive Committee, 
could not be reached for comment over email, and

Yale College Dean Jonathan Holloway declined to 
be interviewed.)
 Two students I interviewed mentioned cases 
that didn’t involve Yale Police and so didn’t even 
reach the Executive Committee. Instead, the students 
were given a lecture by their residential college dean. 
Both Jane and Carmen still use the fake IDs of other 
students who look like them to get into clubs from 
time to time, though they say they do so with 
more anxiety.
Perhaps Yalies would be more clued-in to the 
mild punitive repercussions of having a fake ID if 
more students had to sit in front of the Executive 
Committee or hire a lawyer, as Jane and Carmen 
did. Getting caught, however, appears to be a rare 
occurrence: only eighteen percent said that their 
IDs hadn’t worked on more than one occasion. 
Garbarsky told me that this may be because fake 
IDs have become more sophisticated since 2002, 
when he started working in a lower court that 
prosecuted their use. At the time, nine out of ten 
of his cases involved cards that had been doctored 
with Wite-Out.  
C.P., a bouncer I talked to at Kelly’s Bar on Crown 
Street, confirmed that it’s become more difficult to 
spot illegitimate licenses. He said that while some 
fake IDs are obvious, many have the same technology 
scanning machines and ultraviolet lights screen for. 
“These IDs fool the police,” he said. “A trained 
eye is really your best bet … but nobody can be a 
hundred percent with it, I don’t think. Not at all.” 
Like other bouncers I talked to, C.P. seemed to 
have a defeatist attitude about underage drinking. 
While he used to keep an ultraviolet light on hand to 
check for holograms, he stopped after the batteries 
ran out. He also admitted that he’s sympathetic to 
underclassmen who might feel excluded—he used 
to borrow his older brother’s ID to get into clubs 
when he was younger—and thinks that the drinking 
age should be eighteen. So when he does spot fakes, 
he just gives them back. 
“What could you do?” he said. Theoretically, he 
could call the police. But he doesn’t.
BAR Pizza, another local restaurant, makes an 
earnest effort to combat fake ID use, but with a simi­
larly soft hand. Dan Brodoff, BAR’s manager, told me 
that he’s dedicated to maintaining the venue’s twen­
ty-one-plus environment and requires his bouncers 
to use a booklet of state-issued driver’s licenses to 
screen for fakes. Despite BAR’s self-professed auster­
ity, though, Brodoff tells his bouncers to hand back 
any IDs they catch to avoid legal entanglements or 
alienating future clientele. 
BAR has a reputation among students for being 
particularly strict at the door, but there are a number 
of establishments in New Haven that students feel are 
far more complicit. Amelia told me that the bouncer 
at Box 63 once checked her ID using a scanner and 
admitted her even though her ID didn’t register as 
authentic (the manager at Box 63 declined to com­
ment). Two students also pointed out that Toad’s 
Place has a weekly event on Wednesdays advertised 
as a “Yale Dance Party,” but will accept non-Yale IDs 
from people over twenty-one for a five-dollar charge. 
When I asked a doorman at Toad’s about what 
precautions they take to prevent minors from using 
fakes, she said there was an overhead camera at the 
entrance, but “when it comes to a machine, we don’t 
really enforce it.”
So while it’s true that Yale students are the ones 
who buy and use the fakes, the people accepting 
them don’t seem particularly up in arms about it 
either. The current generation of IDs is highly sophis­
ticated, and in a college town, the revenue that pro­
prietors stand to gain from a lenient approach could 
very well be worth the risk of incurring exorbitant 
fines. If there were any pretense left that the people 
in charge of keeping alcohol away from minors 
regarded their mission as a moral one, my talks with 
local bouncers dispelled it. 
Some students did note that there has been a 
police crackdown on admitting and serving minors 
during their time at Yale. Local liquor store College
