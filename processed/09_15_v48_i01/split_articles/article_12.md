T
he woman I’m interviewing reaches across the 
yellowed plastic table and takes my chapped hands 
between her own. I’ll call her Lucía. She is middle-
aged, with creases around her eyes but girlish dimples 
on her cheeks. We are sitting in a dimly lit café on the 
edge of the sprawling slum, or villa, where she lives in 
Buenos Aires. I have just asked if she misses her home 
in Peru. It’s June, winter in the Southern Hemisphere, 
and she pulls her thickly knit sweater tighter around 
her middle. “De vez en cuando,” (Sometimes), she 
says. “Do you miss yours?” Sí, I reply. The tip of my 
nose tingles the way it does before I am going to cry. 

I had lasted through only three weeks of classes 
about Argentinean infant mortality statistics before I 
quit my study-abroad program in Buenos Aires. In­
stead, for two months, I walked the city’s narrow 
cobblestone streets from barrio to barrio. Recoleta, 
Palermo, Almagro, Abasto, San Telmo. Broad-leafed 
palms dripping flowering vines. Walls painted with 
pink and purple nymphs. Parks filled with roses and 
patchy grass and very small kids who were very good 
at kicking soccer balls. And everywhere, strange, fad­
ed Spanish colonials and tall, quiet apartment build­
ings whose walls, I was sure, had harbored yesterday’s 
militants and their torturers. 

I made friends in bars, in chamber-music classes, 
and on the bus. But I had promised my time only to 
myself, and I often turned down plans in order to sit 
in hundred-year-old cafes in the late afternoon where 
the light from stained glass windows cast colored dia­
monds on the marble tables. Crossing the noisy street 
near my apartment at dusk, I would sometimes feel a 
sudden tightness in the pit of my stomach. I was far 
from home and about to cook another omelet in a 
dark kitchen alone. But I could shake off my gloom by 
remembering that here, I had chosen independence. I 
could transform loneliness into alone-ness.

The days got colder and dusk fell before dinner­
time. More and more, my unplanned hours seemed to 
expand frighteningly. Hoping to feel productive and 
useful, I joined a volunteer team at an NGO. I would 
work in the office and, once a week, help give work­
shops about healthcare and rights to migrant women 
like Lucía who lived in the villas of Buenos Aires. Dur­
ing my time off, I planned to interview some of the 
women about their access to healthcare as part of my 
senior anthropology project at Yale.

On a Wednesday evening, I followed the other 
volunteers to Lucía’s home in the villa, where we were 
to lead the workshop. Dim light from an unshaded 
bulb on the ceiling illuminated the single ground-
floor room. Twenty-odd women leaned against 
stained, unpainted walls or settled on the sunken 
couch and overturned buckets on the concrete floor. 
Another volunteer made introductions and began to 
explain that under Argentina’s Law 25.271, migrants 
have the right to free healthcare, education, and ad­
equate housing. “But there is discrimination against 
us everywhere,” a stooped, older woman said, step­
ping forward. Others said they envisioned a future 
when making an appointment at the local public 
clinic would not mean waking up at 4 a.m. to get in 
line, and ambulance drivers would no longer refuse 
to enter the villa out of fear. Some nodded along, but 
most were already chatting amongst themselves and 
scolding one another’s toddlers. Realizing that it was 
late and that the group was losing energy, we packed 
up and promised we’d discuss the issues further the 
following week. 

I shivered as we walked back to the bus stop 
along one of the narrow, unpaved streets. Dinnertime. 
The spicy smell of grilling meat mixed with some­
thing rotting. A maze of slender buildings, three and 
four stories, jumbled stacks of colored boxes rising 
on either side of the road. Young men outside small 
restaurants blasting music and stands with Quilmes 
beer signs. Skinny dogs weaving between legs. Dogs

sprawled on their sides, rib cages heaving. A woman 
stepping from an open doorway and slopping a buck­
et of grey water into the street. 

By the time I got off the No. 92 bus back in “the 
rest” of Buenos Aires, I felt weak. I was safe in my 
air-conditioning, safe in my clean cotton sheets. But 
I was sweating right through them. Some roll of the 
dice had dropped me in the right side of Buenos Aires 
on a comfortable mattress in a freshly painted apart­
ment. I knew that if I thought about where I had just 
been I would cry, so instead I thought about what I 
was doing there. But I was hardly the right person 
to be teaching these women about their rights in Ar­
gentina. I, who could barely remember the names of 
the Argentinian presidential candidates, who still felt 
like a third-grader trying to read the news in La Nación 
and Pagina 12 each morning. And on top of all this, I 
wanted to take these women’s stories and share them 
with a few students and professors who spoke a dif­
ferent language in a different hemisphere.

I forced myself to take deep breaths as I sat in 
the NGO’s office that week, working on posters for 
our next workshop and researching Law 25.271. Tak­
ing the train back to my apartment at rush hour, I 
couldn’t suppress the sense that everything I was do­
ing was wrong. At night I ate alone so I wouldn’t have 
to answer my friends’ questions about my work. I 
was too embarrassed to email my advisor at Yale to 
ask for help. 

I assured my supervisor at the NGO that every­
thing was going well, but when we returned to the 
villa for our second workshop, I felt the bile rise in my 
throat. I had woken up that morning with my stom­
ach churning. We were finally here, and the buildings 
were too close together. Motorcycles, loud bass beats, 
and human shouts competed in the dark. I forced 
my gaze down and saw chicken bones in the mud. I 
pressed two fingers to the pressure point on my wrist 
to keep the nausea under control as we walked inside 
Lucía’s house, but the scent of baking bread was over­
whelming. As Lucía offered the other volunteers rolls 
off a baking sheet, I yanked the metal door back open. 
Hands on my knees, I dry-heaved in the street. Several 
yards away two men carrying a mattress up a ladder 
to a second-story landing stared at me. “Colorada!” they 
called. “Redhead!”

I snuck back inside and whispered an apologet­
ic excuse to Lucía about food poisoning. She placed 
her hands on my shoulders, led me to the couch, 
and handed me a roll. Lying down and biting into 
the warm bread, my breathing eased. A middle-aged 
woman perched on the arm of the sofa and intro­
duced herself as Soledad. She began to rub my an­
kles. “This is what my oldest daughter likes,” she said. 
“Does it help?” As the other volunteers hung up the 
posters I had made listing the clauses of Law 25.271, 
I stayed on the couch with Soledad. Thinking it was 
safe to open my mouth again, I asked her where she 
was from. “Lima,” she said, the capital city of Peru. 
Now she was Lucía’s neighbor. “Lucía knows all my 
secrets!” she said in a false whisper. “Last night I came 
home at midnight and she was scolding me.” We both 
looked over at Lucía and laughed. 

That night I smiled at everyone on the No. 92 
bus. Helping to give the workshops and starting my 
anthropology project were things I could actually do,
