similarities end there. The curriculum is dramatically 
different from what Barnes encountered at school a 
generation ago.  

The General Education Development (GED) test, 
a staple of the adult education system for the past 
seven decades, was entirely revamped at the begin­
ning of 2014. The new test has become more chal­
lenging and is offered only on the computer.

The previous version of the test, which had been 
used since 2002, included one essay and multiple-
choice questions in five subjects: math, writing, 
science, reading, and social studies. The new exam 
combines the reading and writing sections and 
includes question formats such as drag-and-drop, 
fill-in-the-blank, and extended response. You can’t 
get lucky and guess your way to a passing score. 

The GED has long helped Americans escape 
poverty by steering them toward college or a better 
job. The GED test became nationally popular after 
World War II when an assessment was needed for 
returning soldiers who had not completed high 
school. Soon the appeal spread to non-veterans. Today, 
over 800,000 people take the GED each year, earn­
ing it the nickname “America’s Largest High School.” 

According to the Pew Hispanic Center, twenty-one 
percent of high school dropouts eventually 
receive a GED.

But the changes may threaten this long-standing 
avenue toward upward mobility. Students in Con­
necticut already feel the effects. In 2013, 3,500 
people in the state passed the GED. In 2014, just 280 
people passed. The decrease of ninety-two percent 
reflects both the new test’s increased difficulty and 
the rush of students who took the test in 2013, be­
fore the changes. The trend was similar nationwide.

The GED Testing Service is a collaboration 
between the American Council on Education, an as­
sociation of leaders in higher education, and Pearson, 
a for-profit testing and publishing company. Pearson 
establishes the GED curriculum, but states can decide 
whether to offer the GED or another high school 
equivalency test. State and local education boards 
finance programs to help students prepare for and 
take the test. This web is complicated, but the funda­
mental premise is not: the GED is a credential of last 
resort, a door left open to people who may have few 
other options in their quest for education. 

Even with recent changes, the GED faces some­
thing of an identity crisis. Should it replicate the 
American high school curriculum, down to the ac­
complishments of President James K. Polk, or should 
the material be tailored to the diversity of test takers’ 
professional aspirations? Most students interviewed—
both those employed and unemployed—hoped to 
use the test as a step toward additional schooling, 
typically vocational. But in seeking to rescue the GED 
from the moniker “Good Enough Diploma,” the 
bureaucrats and educators at the GED Testing Service 
have erected what many adult learners view as frus­
trating and arbitrary barriers to opportunity. 

Goldburn works at a child development center 
in New Haven caring for six- to eight-month-old 
infants. She is studying for the GED because her 
job requires a Child Development Associate (CDA) 
credential, which mandates a high school degree 
or equivalent. 

“I really don’t want to do it,” Goldburn says, 
shaking her head. She came to the U.S. from Jamaica 
in 1989 and is less familiar with some of the content 
on American history and civics, which are included 
in the GED social studies curriculum, along with 
economics, geography, and world history. I ask Gold­
burn whether the material on the GED is relevant to 
her job. She responds, “It has absolutely nothing to 
do with the children.” 

A classroom at the East Haven Adult Learning 
Center (EHALC), a nonprofit education center in 
East Haven, Connecticut, offered a snapshot of the 
challenges facing test designers: the students ranged 
from a middle-aged woman from Sierra Leone who 
had been out of school for years to young men who 
had only recently left American high schools.

According to a pamphlet provided by the GED 
Testing Service, the recent changes align the GED’s 
content with the demands of employers and higher 
education institutions. Businesses sometimes wrote

off the old GED as too easy to be a meaningful 
measure of ability. And when it came to salaries, a 
U.S. Census Bureau study found that individuals with 
a GED earned approximately 1,600 dollars less each 
month than those with a diploma. The new test is 
meant to change this statistic.

“It’s a wonderful new instrument. It’s brought 
students who have taken this test into the twenty-
first century,” says Joe Ferraiolo, the principal of 
the EHALC. On the edge of his desk teeter stacks of 
paper containing student forms and information on 
tests and grant applications. Ferraiolo leafs through 
them as he explains that some of the GED changes 
are good. Ferraiolo is particularly enthusiastic about 
the more detailed transcripts students receive, which 
make it easier for employers to understand results.

Adama Jalah, who attends the EHALC, went to 
high school in her native Sierra Leone, but after she 
emigrated in 1979, she had trouble getting her tran­
scripts out of the war-torn nation. Jalah took the old 
test and missed the passing score of 2,250 by just 
thirty points. “I thought I was going to get it before 
it changed,” she laments. But Jalah remains diligent. 
She works as a nursing assistant in West Haven and 
is studying for the GED with the hope of attending 
nursing school. 

Jalah’s GED instructor, Diane Albright, has been 
teaching at EHALC for twelve years. In class, Albright 
pla ys Simon and Garfunkel as background music 
and offers muffins and chocolate to her students as 
“energy food.” On a Wednesday morning in late April, 
she holds up news clippings on everything from 
the earthquake in Nepal to a survey on the world’s 
happiest country. Jalah pipes up with questions about 
the survey’s sample size. Across the table, a teenager 
in a loose gray sweatshirt thumbs through notifica­
tions on his cellphone with clear disinterest. 

Later, Albright tells me that much of the new 
material is simply too hard for students to master in 
a typical GED course. Many students are already be­
hind when they come into adult education programs, 
and it takes time for them to catch up. In general, 
it takes students at EHALC six months to a year to 
prepare for the test. Since many students work full 
time while studying, they often have little time to 
review outside of class. Albright says that sometimes 
students show up to class without having slept the 
previous night. 

Students’ frustrations with the test’s new chal­
lenges are evident in the classroom. The school 
currently serves around 230 students, with approxi­
mately forty-five in the GED program. Ferraiolo says 
that when the new test was introduced, EHALC saw 
a dramatic drop in attendance. A similar decline 
occurred after the implementation of the 2002 test, 
and he expects that the numbers will start to bounce 
back in the next year. 

The changes to the GED, born in America’s in­
dustrial heyday, are intended to keep the test relevant 
in a transformed economy. 

Even so, some have already decided the new test 
isn’t worth it. In response to higher costs and stan­
dards, certain states have adopted alternatives. New 
York, Nevada, and Indiana have all begun to use the 
Test Assessing Secondary Education. Six states now 
offer the High School Equivalency Test. Both cover 
material similar to that of the GED, but are cheaper 
and can be taken online or on paper.  

Connecticut also offers classes for a Credit Diplo­
ma, which is geared toward those between seventeen 
and twenty-three who are completing high school 
credits, and the National External Diploma Program, 
which is more focused on professional life skills, 
such as proficiency in Microsoft Office. 

But even in this more crowded testing landscape, 
the GED remains the most popular choice. Sitting at 
a plastic wood table in the Keefe Community Center, 
I ask Goldburn if she has a backup plan if she doesn’t 
pass the GED. She responds, “Hopefully, when I take 
the test, I’ll pass it.”
