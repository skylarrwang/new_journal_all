T
he seventy-five men and women in blue and black 
uniforms trace the perimeter of the basketball 
court in Payne Whitney Gymnasium with crisp, syn­
chronized movements. As the students march, the pa­
triotic chords of “Anchors Aweigh,” “Off We Go into 
the Wild Blue Yonder,” and the “Marine’s Hymn”—
the traditional songs of the United States Navy, Air 
Force, and Marines—resonate across the gym. 
Row by row, the cadets and midshipmen of Yale’s 
Air Force and Naval Reserve Officer’s Training Corps 
battalions salute Yale President Peter Salovey, the pre­pre­
siding officer for this review late last spring. Wearing 
a plain black blazer in the middle of a row of deco­
rated military uniforms, Salovey cuts a conspicuous 
figure. At one point in Yale’s history, the President’s 
Review was an annual event, but today marks the 
first time in over four decades that Yale’s president 
has presided over a public event honoring students 
who have committed to serving in the United States 
armed forces.
“This is a historic day for the University and for 
ROTC,” Salovey declares. “The spirit of sacrifice that 
links these military men and women is a hallmark of 
the spirit of Yale itself.”  
 “Bright College Years,” Yale’s unofficial alma ma­
ter, famously concludes with the line, “For God, for 
Country, and for Yale.” The middle prepositional phrase 
harkens to a certain noblesse oblige that once compelled 
thousands of Yale men to serve in the United States 
military. 

Relics of this ethos are ubiquitous on campus. Ev­
ery day, students walking through Woolsey Rotunda 
pass the names of hundreds who died serving their 
country. The whale-shaped Ingalls Hockey rink bears 
the name of the U.S. Navy’s only ace pilot (a pilot 
who has shot down five enemy aircrafts) during the 
First World War. The alumni rosters of Yale College in­
clude the class of 1945-War (’45W)—a designation 
for students who completed their undergraduate de­
grees in thirty-one months to ship off more quickly 
to the frontlines of World War II.
Yale became home to one of the country’s six 
original Naval ROTC units in 1916. According to 
a 1917 issue of the Yale Alumni Weekly, approximately 
9,500 Yale students and alumni fought in the First 
World War. During World War II, so many students 
left to join the military that Yale could fill only three 
residential colleges, mostly with men deemed medi­
cally unfit for service. The University rented the other 
seven colleges and Old Campus to the U.S. Military 
for training purposes. In total, 18,678 Yale students 
and alumni served in Word War II—an almost in­
comprehensible statistic today, at a time when few 
Yale students volunteer to serve and the draft is no 
longer in effect. 


At Yale and across the country, disillusionment 
with the armed forces set in as the death toll rose 
in Vietnam. In 1970, while the campus roiled with 
anti-war protests, the University severed ties with 
its strongest institutional attachment to the armed 
forces: the ROTC program. The military’s presence 
on Yale’s campus virtually disappeared, and animosity 
continued for years. In 2005, for example, Yale Law 
School banned military recruiters from their annual 
career fair to protest “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”—the 
policy barring homosexuals from serving openly in 
the military. The two institutions ultimately spent al­
most two years settling the issue in the court system. 
Ultimately, in 2007, an appeals court forced the Law 
School to choose between allowing military recruit­
ers and forfeiting approximately $300 million in fed­
eral funding, so the recruiters returned to campus.
In the last five years, however reengagement has 
occurred voluntarily and on multiple levels, both of­
ficial and unofficial. The military has become a sig­
nificant presence at Yale once more. In 2012, after the 
repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” the ROTC returned 
to Yale and soon turned into one of the largest and 
fastest-growing student military programs in New 
England. Other changes include the hiring of high-
profile personnel, such as retired U.S. Army General 
Stanley McChrystal, and the uniting of Yale veterans 
in the Yale Veteran’s Association (YVA). In April, the 
YVA—which sought to connect the roughly 10,000 
Yale veterans across the country—hosted the Ivy 
League’s first Veteran’s Summit.
