This shared commitment to public service has 
provided the rhetorical common ground for Yale and 
the military. “It’s a desire to serve, this is what charac­
terizes this University,” Salovey declared at the ROTC 
President’s Review. “Within these walls you can hear 
the echoes of history—a love of country, dedication, 
humility, and humanity—echoes that ring out loud 
all around us today.” But, in practice, few Yale stu­
dents enter public sector jobs after graduation. Last 
year, the Office of Career Services survey reported 
that the five largest employers of the class of 2014 
were Goldman Sachs, McKinsey & Company, Bain & 
Company, Microsoft, Boston Consulting Group, and 
Yale University itself. 

Every military affiliate I interviewed was quick 
to say that the military is not the path most Yale stu­
dents will—or should—choose. Still, “the idea of 
service should be something that is implied for Yale 
students,” McChrystal said. Neither the ROTC mem­
bers nor the veterans nor the military faculty want to 
turn back the clock to days when students drilled on 
Old Campus. But they are charged with bridging the 
gap between two powerhouse institutions, amidst 
a student body that is more ambivalent about and 
distanced from the path of service they have chosen 
to take. The people in uniform on campus today are 
only a small section of campus—a far cry from the 
military’s large historical footprint—but, at the very 
least they have started a cordial dialogue between 
those who serve and those who probably never will.
