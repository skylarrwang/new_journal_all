passive acceptance of Yale’s fake ID culture that 
often borders on complicity. 

Maybe this isn’t such a bad thing. Maybe 
students can keep wiring money to accounts in 
Guangzhou and sneaking into bars with laissez-
faire bouncers. Maybe Yale can continue to have soft 
punishments for fake IDs, and prosecutors can keep 
letting students off easy. Maybe this strange, unspo­
ken agreement among all parties involved is actually 
a satisfactory equilibrium. The legal system still gets 
to pay lip service to the law, and college can continue 
to remain as fun as it’s always looked in Hollywood 
comedies. And given that an eighteen-year-old can 
legally purchase a gun before they can a gin and 
tonic, New Haven police officers probably have a better 
use for their resources than catching underage drinkers.

But part of me also thinks that the current sys­
tem has problems. For one, it teaches young adults 
that it’s O.K. to have a blatant disregard for the law. 
While that’s not such a bad thing when it comes to 
fake IDs, it’s certainly not an attitude that one would 
want brought to, say, hard drug use or drunk driving. 
Fake IDs have also displayed potential to smooth 
the edges of Yale’s drinking culture, but that leaves 
fewer, perhaps riskier social options for those with­
out them. Yale students don’t need fake IDs to drink 
alcohol, and they won’t as long as some subset of the 
college population is able to buy liquor. Instead, the 
majority of students use their fakes to access social 
spaces, to spend time with friends in bars and clubs. 
For many students, especially as the novelty of dorm 
parties wears off, that kind of drinking is far more 
appealing, and potentially healthier. 

Of course, it’s difficult to generalize as to whe-
ther bar culture is in fact less conducive to dangerous 
drinking patterns, as many students maintained. 
I imagine that there are other campuses drier than 
Yale’s where alcohol is hard to come by and the nearest 
Wine, for example, had its liquor license suspended 
last year and was fined $13,500 for selling to minors. 
Another liquor store near campus called Gag Jr’s, 
which multiple students described as “the place” to 
buy alcohol with a fake, recently started requiring 
two forms of ID from Yale students after police of­
ficers started catching more minors leaving the shop. 
When the store instituted the policy last spring, it 
saw a marked decrease in business, and an employee 
told me that he’s sure that students will soon find 
a way to counterfeit Yale IDs. (John, who recently 
bought alcohol there with his fake ID, simply told 
the cashier that he was a New Haven resident and so 
didn’t have to supply a second form.)

Of the 134 students who had an opinion on 
the matter, eighty-five percent described the general 
policy of New Haven institutions with respect to 
fake IDs as “fairly lenient” or “very lenient.” That 
perceived leniency undoubtedly contributes to the 
openness surrounding fakes on campus. One sopho­
more in Calhoun told me that her English professor 
once invited her to get drinks with him if her “fake 
was good enough,” and C.P. told me that minors 
often ask him which bars in the area are least strict 
about checking IDs. Even if students do get caught 
outside a store or in a raid, the punishment is small, 
so they remain relatively unfazed.

It would be tempting to think that Yale and 
New Haven authorities truly cleave to the idea that 
drinking under the age of twenty-one is harmful, 
but merely do a bad job of enforcing this belief. But 
around Yale’s campus, the law simply lacks the cour­
age of its convictions, and many people in charge—a 
large portion of whom could drink when they were 
eighteen—don’t seem particularly invested in what 
it stands for. From bouncers to prosecutors, there is a 
bar is a car ride away, making off-campus drinking a 
much riskier activity. But for students looking to get 
thoroughly intoxicated at Yale, at least, where alcohol 
flows readily and drunk driving is for the most part 
a nonissue, the wobbly walked path of least resis­
tance seems to bend away from five-dollar shots and 
back towards campus. And as C.P. told me, a lot of 
students he sees get drunk at home and go out after 
“for the environment.” That’s not to say that people 
don’t get wasted in public spaces, but it’s probably 
reasonable to assume that an underage student is 
better off getting a cocktail from a real bar instead of 
from the trigger-happy freshman consigned to pour­
ing vodka from plastic bottles in Saybrook’s over­
crowded, twelve-person party suite. The irony of our 
current drinking laws, though, is that without a fake 
ID, the former avenue is by far the more restricted.

So yes, we could continue like this, in this 
bizarre, liminal space where a significant portion of 
the Yale student body is buying fake IDs and little is 
done to stop it. But this tacit agreement perpetuates 
a culture in which minors who choose not to buy 
fake IDs may find it easier to get a handle of vodka 
or a drink with grain alcohol than to order a glass of 
wine. The drinking age is ostensibly set as high as it 
is because we believe that it will make minors safer, 
but the current environment is such that those who 
want to drink in less precarious spaces can only do 
so if they’re willing to break more laws and jump 
through a number of costly hoops. 

If, as Dow said, the principal crime here is really 
underage drinking, then it’s difficult to condemn 
those who own fakes as being culpable of some 
unique moral transgression without also vilifying ev­
ery Yale student who drinks before the age of twenty-
one. On the other hand, it doesn’t seem fair to place 
an even larger burden on local businesses for not 
playing by the rules when doing so has become vir­
tually impossible. And because such a large portion 
of fake IDs is acquired through massive distributors, 
local authorities simply aren’t equipped to combat 
the source of the problem. 

“What ends up happening is that the law exists,” 
Nora said, “and everyone dances around it.” 

Until someone with much more power than 
college students and bouncers recognizes that this is 
not how a legal system and its citizens are meant to 
interact, a huge portion of the Yale population will 
continue to see fake IDs as a rite of passage, the law a 
half-hearted scarecrow to be made their perch.
