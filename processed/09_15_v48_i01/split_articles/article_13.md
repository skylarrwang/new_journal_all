I realized. With her hand on my ankle, Soledad had 
given me the care I hadn’t been able to admit I needed. 

The next day I asked my supervisor at the NGO for 
advice on drafting a list of questions for the women 
who came to our workshops about how they understood their right to healthcare in Argentina. I emailed 
my advisor at Yale and held practice interviews with 
my friends. “When did you arrive in Argentina?” I 
asked a friend as she sat at my kitchen table. “When 
was the last time you saw a doctor?” “Do you know 
that you have the right to free healthcare as a migrant?”  

Over the next month, I interviewed Lucía, Soledad, and three other women in the café on the edge 
of the villa. I hugged Soledad when she walked into 
the café in July. As she sat down, I asked about her 
daughter who has just turned eleven. “The birthday 
cake we made was so big that Lucía had to help me 
carry it!” she said. She asked me how my weekend 
was, whether I had friends there, or a boyfriend. “No,” 
I told her, men take too much time. Soledad smiled 
and rolled her eyes. “Men take time because you have 
to explain everything to them,” she said. “I know,” I 
said. “They don’t even understand themselves.” She 
agreed. “You and I, we see everything. Even what we 
wish we didn’t!”  

In one of my last interviews, I turn on my voice 
recorder and ask another woman when she came to 
Buenos Aires, and whether it was hard for her to adjust to living here. She tells me that when she first arrived ten years ago, she cried every day for her mother 
back in Bolivia. “I cried so much I thought I’d be sick,” 
she says quietly. She pauses and I don’t interrupt. “You 
know,” she says finally, “I haven’t talked about this in 
a long time.” As I settle my elbows on the café table, it 
occurs to me that as an anthropology student, at least 
I can give her this. By listening, by trying to understand, I can show her that I care. “I cry a lot here, too,” 
I say. “But it’s different for you,” she replies, raising 
her eyebrows. “At least you know you’re going home.”
