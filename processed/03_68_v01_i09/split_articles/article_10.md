Letters 
To the Editors: 
The article "Our Air War, by Robert 
Crichton" (February 4), reprinted from 
the N ew Y ork Review of Books, discusses 
the U.S. Air Force techniques in Vietnam, 
and damns those techniques in no uncer-
tain terms. However, one wonders why, 
as the article states, the book "Air War: 
Vietnam was published in a silence"? Is 
it possibly because the book itself is not 
nearly as sensational as the article in the 
New York Review? This latter question 
becomes more than a mere possibility 
when one realizes that the editorial policy 
of the New York Review is only slightly 
to the right of Ramparts'. I doubt, there-
fore, whether any of the seventeen Yale 
staff members who found the article 
"exceptionally revealing" has actually 
read the book; and I suggest that they have 
displayed a receptiveness to opinions, 
coinciding with their own, rather than 
to facts.

Milton Shaw's letter (New Journal, 
February 18, 1968) attacking those who 
oppose the Vietnam war pretends to be 
that of a rational human being. At first, I 
thought it was a heavy-handed satire. 
Upon reflection, I have concluded that 
Mr. Shaw's heavy hand is quicker than 
his gimlet eye. The blindness which results 
and which he attributes to others qualifies 
him as an apologist of the Administra-
tion's Vietnam war policy. It is he who 
misses the point. True, all war is essentially 
immoral, but does it then follow that the 
Vietnam war deserves support? Murders 
are crimes. Although they are essentially 
immoral, would Apologist Shaw consent to 
commit one? T he point is that the United 
States appears in the guise of aggressor, 
waging a war in defiance of the norms of 
international political morality and of its 
own self-professed ideals. The point is 
that the Administration indulges in dis-
tortion of history and fact, mystification 
and statistical legerdemain in order to 
propagandize a policy which it cannot 
truthfully justify. The point is that men 
should not for such a policy be placed in a 
position where the "beat of battle" will 
lead them to commit atrocities. 

In limiting himself to _a consideration 
of battlefield atrocities, Apologist Shaw 
has once. again missed the point. The point 
is that the United States kills Vietnamese 
for purposes toward which most Viet-
namese are either hostile or indifferent. 
The point is that the United States com-
mits atrocities not in the heat of battle 
but with cold calculation. It creates 
refugees through massive bombardment 
of civilian centers and indiscriminate 
artillery fire coupled with equally wanton 
air strikes in the countryside. It poisons 
the environment through chemical de-
foliation and crop destruction. It condones 
the treatment which the ARVN metes out 
to Vietnamese prisoners. The point is 
that an American, sitting in the hermetic 
cockpit of an F-1 00 and flying in an un-
contested sky, can hardly be said to act 
in "the heat of battle" as he rakes a row of 
Vietnamese huts with 20 mm. cannon fire. 
The point is that the victory which the 
United States seeks in this "people's war" 
can only be attained by pursuit of a policy 
the very essence of which is mounting 
atrocity. 

Apologist Shaw is himself dimly aware 
of this. Rational human being that he is, 
he cannot forego self-contradiction. 
Atrocities, he says, are commited by in-
dividuals in "the beat of battle." He de-
plores this. What is his remedy for the only 
evil he perceives? Opponents of the war 
should enlist in the service in order to 
bring about "a minor revolution in policy." 
How can "a minor revolution in policy" 
put a stop to the atrocities which accord-
ing to Apologist Shaw are inevitably 
commited by soldiers in battle? After all, 
this war, like all wars--once again accord· 
ing to Apologist Shaw-is essentially 
immoral. New sets of participants and 
minor revolutions in policy cannot alter 
the facts of war and thereby put an end 
to the atrocities which he sanctimoniously 
deplores. 

The only parallel which I can find for 
Apologist Shaw's naivete is his own 
ignorance. Does he really think that an 
officer ordered to level a district capital 
"in order to save it," will refuse to obey? 
I suspect that Apologist Shaw would have 
opponents of the war court-martialed and 
executed for refusing to obey orders rather 
than have them go to prison for resisting 
the draft. 

Apologist Shaw yearns for facts, proof 
and special knowledge. Can he array all 
this in support of his contentions that 
North Vietnamese Communism threatens 
"the American way of life," that China 
and North Vietnam operate hand in 
glove, that certain Communist govern· 
ments can be termed mature and others 
"immature"? Should Apologist Shaw care 
to inform himself about the Vietnam war, 
there are many books which he might 
find instructive. These include Bernard 
Fall's The Two Vietnams and Vietnam 
Witness, Robert Shaplen's The Lost 
Revolution, Jean Lacouture's Vietnam: 
Between Two Truces, George Kahin and 
John Lewis's The United States in Viet· 
nam, and Frank Harvey's Air War: 
Vietnam. Should books place too great a 
strain on Apologist Shaw's attention span, 
he might devote himself to an intelligent 
reading of the New York Times and the 
foreign press. Or is that contrary to the 
"American way of life"?

This is an angry reply to the complimen· 
tary articles on Joseph Heller you have 
printed. If The New Journal is to be a 
medium of truth rather than of star-struck 
opinion (as have been the references to 
Heller at the Yale Drama School), the 
Yale community should be made aware of 
certain facts upon which opinion may be 
more firmly grounded. 

Joseph Heller's We Bombed in New. 
Haven was clearly not a welcome step Ill 
any direction at the Yale Repertory 
Theatre. H eller was committed neither to 
drama nor to the kind of cooperative pro-
duction process the Drama School and 
Repertory Company claim to be gropin& 
towards. Heller approached his play first 
as a playful diversion from the novel 
he is writing, and second as literature. 
Never did he accept the collaborative 
experience of theatre, as is evidenced.bY 
his adamant refusal to revise or rewn te 
the flawed sections of his opus. His 
attitude was: "I am J oseph H eller. I have 
written a play. It is a finished product. 
Here, do it." Great playwrights (Shake-
speare, Marlowe, Moliere, etc.) have
