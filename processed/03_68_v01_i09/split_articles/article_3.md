Two cellists 
by Robert Wimpelberg 
Robert Wimpelberg, a senior in Yale 
College, is president and principal cellist 
of the Yale Symphony Orchestra. 
It was late in the evening almost a month 
ago, at the reception for cellist Ralph 
Kirshbaum's impressive recital at Sprague 
Hall. The hum of conversation had 
gradually muted and a precipitate of 
champagne glasses littered the tables. 
Three people stood in the center of the 
silent room: Ralph Kirshbaum, his pianist 
Elizabeth Sawyer Parisot, and her hus-
band, Kirshbaum's teacher, Aldo Parisot. 
Parisot was the first to speak. "Ralph," 
he said, "I w.ant to tell you that the slow 
movement of the Brahms Sonata was 
one of the most beautiful movements I 
have ever heard anyone play." The 
master's first critical words brought smiles 
of satisfaction. "But tomorrow we must 
talk about the way you played the Debussy 
Sonata." Parisot did not elaborate. 
Kirshbaum was noticeably happy with 
his teacher's assessment of the Brahms. 
The slow movement had insinuated itself 
into his musical memory as he had pre-
pared for the recital, and it had become his 
personal favorite. As for the Debussy 
Sonata, Kirshbaum's eyes lit up as he 
recaptured the impressions of the recital 
performance a couple of hours earlier. 
"I must say that tonight I was convinced 
with what I did in the Debussy. But we 
must talk about it tomorrow." 
The Debussy Sonata has a tremendous 
significance in Parisot's long and brilliant 
concert career. While he has performed 
the piece m any times, it is always a 1962 
Paris recital performance which comes 
first to his mind. Parisot simply over-
whelmed the influential reviewers of the 
Parisian press, especially Le Figaro. The 
reviewers called it the most beautiful and 
meaningful performance of the French 
impressionist sonata they had heard. Since 
that time Parisot has played the Debussy 
Sonata and large amounts of the cello 
recital and concerto literature all over the 
world with equal success, and even today 
he maintains a busy concertizing schedule . . 
Parisot, then, is not only a teacher of 
performance but also an active performer 
in his own right, with a history matched 
by few other cellists. 


Some of what Parisot conveys to the 
aspiring Kirshbaum is drawn directly from 
Parisot's sensitive impressions of his own 
performance experiences. For: example, 
he can suggest that a certain kind of bow 
stroke in a certain passage of music will 
produce just the right tone to project 
through the piano line, or through an 
orchestral accompaniment, or in the 
acoustics of a certain hall. Beyond the 
specific insights, Parisot's long and still 
active career (he first concertized when be 
was twelve) gives him an overview from 
which he can advise Kirshbaum. 

The initial precept he is quick to estab-
lish is that a performer of music cannot 
rest on his laurels. As he recounts: "I 
played three recitals in Town Hall in New 
York in 1963. The reviews were very 
good to me, but now they are almost 
worthless pieces of paper. So next year 
I will have to go back to Town Hall and 
play again. It's like prizefighting. You 
always have to keep flexing your muscles." 

AJdo Parisot is an internationally-known 
concert cellist and associate professor of 
·violoncello performance in the Yale 
School of Music. 
Ralph Kirshbaum is a senior in Yale Col-
lege, majoring in the theory of music, and 
studying cello performance with Aldo 
Parisot.·
