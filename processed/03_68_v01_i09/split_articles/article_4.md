Kirshbaurn follows Parisot's axiom. He 
must take (and create) every opportunity 
possible to prove himself to the listening 
public, and his recent bookings show that 
he is confronting the challenge. In a period 
of about thirty days be will travel from 
New Haven to Washington, D.C., and 
Dallas, Texas, to play two full recitals and 
two major concertos. Parisot says, and 
Kirsbbaum quickly acknowledges, that 
all which Kirshbaum has so far achieved 
is but "a drop in the ocean" of that which 
will ultimately be demanded of him. 


On the day following the Sprague Hall 
recital Kirshbaum met Parisot in his studio 
where they had agreed to discuss his per-
formance and, especially, the Debussy 
Sonata. Parisot said nothing about how 
well Kirshbaum played the Debussy 
Sonata in tune, nor did he instruct him in ' 
any other isolated mechanics of playing 
the instrument. That is no longer neces-
sary. Kirshbaum came to Yale with a 
rigorous technical background, bred 
in a European manner by his family. 
"My exposure to music when I was 
young came entirely within my family," 
says Kirshbaum. "My parents, sister and 
two brothers all played instruments, my 
father conducted the civic orchestra in 
Tyler, Texas, and it was an implicit as-
sumption that I, too, would take up a 
musical instrument. Since my father 
played the violin I was immediately drawn 
to the string family and actually took up 
the violin for a while. At the same time, 
I had noticed the cello, and eventually 
it became the one I really wanted to play. 
So I switched." 


Kirshbaum's prodigal success at an 
early age resulted from the sensitive care 
his parents took in overseeing his practice 
habits. He recalls how his father would 
supervise random sessions: "I remember 
playing scales and carefully maintaining 
the intonation and precision of tempo. 
Now and then a note would not be exactly 
right, yet I would play on. My father never 
failed to interrupt, demanding to know 
where I was going-why I didn't stop to 
correct the note before going on." Unerr-
ing exactness became part of Kirshbaum's 
technique. 


As he progressed, his father insisted 
on putting him into the hands of cello 
teachers. From age twelve, Kirshbaum and 
his father made weekly 1 00-mile excur-
sions to Dallas for instruction-a routine 
they continued for six years. "In general, 
I didn't like the routine of practicing at 
that time," says Kirshbaum, "but I loved 
to play the cello and I thrived on the 
~ltcitement of preparing for and playing 
Ill competitions." 


At age eighteen, entrance into college 
was the all-important competition; 
Kinhbaum wanted to study his favorite 
SUbject, English, at a good school. Ac-
cepted at both Yale and Harvard, he chose 
Yale because of the added benefits in his 
lecond area of interest, cello performance. 
In the summer of 1964 he met Parisot 
for the first time. Within a year his second 
area of interest-the cello-became 
dominant. Kirsbbaum was sure be wanted 
to be a concert cellist. 


Much of the mechanical technique 
"hich Kirsbbaum brought to the Debussy 
Sonata, performed in recital this February, 
Was already within his control when be 
lrst met Parisot. However, the difference 
between the Kirshbaums of 1964 and 1968 
lies in the change from the good technician 
to the more totally sensitive musician. 


This is, in great part, the result of what 
Parisot teaches Kirshbaum and how be 
goes about doing it. 


In the post-recital lesson on the Debussy 
Sonata, as in most of his meetings with 
Kirshbaum, Parisot discussed the produc-
tion of colors in cello playing. Parisot 
creates colors of tone and style and makes 
them clear to Kirshbaum by describing 
them in literal terms, in analogical terms, 
by referring to impressions made in out-
side concerts which they both have heard, 
by gesticulating and by playing selected 
passages for his student. "You see," he 
said, "I feel that the impressionism you 
created in the first movement of the 
Debussy Sonata should have been main-
tained more consistently throughout the 
piece. The tone should be more con-
tinuously airy, ffautando, a white sound." 


The color Parisot sensed in the Debussy 
is just one of a whole palette of pigmented 
tones which Kirshbaum has worked to 
create and control. His ability to assimilate 
new styles of playing never ceases to please 
Parisot. "I may suggest a new kind of 
color to him one day," said the teacher. 
"He will go home and practice and when 
he comes back to me in a few days the 
style will already be under his fingers." 


If Kirshbaum had mastered the color 
in which his teacher felt the Debussy 
Sonata should be set, and had actually 
used the style in his performance, why 
did he not maintain it enough to satisfy 
his mentor? Kirshbaum himself answered 
this question in his comment at the recep-
tion: "I must say that tonight I was con-
vinced with what I did in the Debussy." 


Here lies the excitement and dynamic in 
the association between Parisot and 
Kirshbaum as cellists and friends. Kirsh-
baum is very much his own man and his 
music is also very much his own. 


Parisot, furthermore, would have it no 
other way. "I will never take even one 
inch of his personality away from him. 
Let's face it, he plays so well and learns 
so quickly he could imitate everything I 
do. And what would the reviewers say. 
'We've just heard another Parisot.' But 
one Parisot being Parisot is enough. 
Kirshbaum has to be himself. And this is 
the inspiring thing about his playing-that 
already everything he does is fully thought 
out in advance and is performed with 
conviction." 


The creative association between Parisot 
and Kirshbaum is a friendship in which 
they share ideas, exchange criticism and 
catalyze their individual personalities 
as communicants in the medium of the 
cello. This is a friendship creating both a 
new, mature and professional cellist in 
Kirshbaum and a wiser, more inspired 
teacher and performer in Parisot. Both 
teacher and student are working for the 
day when Paris might hear a new inter-
pretation of the Debussy Sonata, equally 
as convincing as the one it heard in 1962.
