No sooner had I stepped into the Art Gallery, where the Annette Funicello Film Festival premiere was being held, than questions began pummelling my brain. It's Art, I thought, looking up at the Gothic arches overhead, but is it Annette? How would Annette herself feel if she were here? We were informed of her inability to "make it," which beach moviegoers bad long suspected anyway.) Perhaps this was the point, certainly an ironic one: an Annette Funicello Festival at which Annette wou.ld feel profoundly out of it, not unlike King Lear, in the play of the same naq~e, cast out of the house by his own daughters.

The film trilogy-Bikini Beach Party, Beach Blanket Bingo and How to Stuff a Wild Bikini-was sponsored by the Record, Yale's humor magazine. The prints of the films were so heavily booked (or closely guarded in the SAC-like underground vaults of major film collectors across the country) that the Record staff had to send to Omaha, Nebraska, to get them. The premiere, Bikini Beach Party, was attended by riff-raff who paid 69Â¢ ($1.50 for a season ticket) and by others invited by engraved invitation: black tie, shirts soft and/ or frilly, dress spangly, low decollete, Zhivago. Hair was done, and ties were very black indeed. Girls were bussed or came of their own volition, and there were far more of them than usual for a Wednesday night. There was a sort of Jim Crow section for the people not dressed up, but they seemed out of place and not a little cowed in the face of all the formality.

The mood was gay, but not too gay. We went through the receiving line of 25 people (who were identified by printed "My name is ... " labels) and moved on into the auditorium. There, other guests sat respectfully in their seats, neither frugging nor shingalinging it, but merely listening to the rock-'n'-roll qua rock-'n'-roll (played by the Erector Set). The band, and some of the guests, wore Mouseketeer hats.

Faces were set in muscled expressions of concern: there was a tacit understanding that this was no mere dogfood commercial we had gathered together to see.

Standish Lawder, assistant professor of history of art, had been invited to make some "remarks." Here was a man, it was clear from his bearing, who had indeed looked into the abyss of film and seen what lay at its heart. "That man has been to the movies," someone behind me said weightily, "he's really been to the movies.''

Eisenstein, Griffith, Truffaut, Godard and now this.

Mr. Lawder informed us, through slides and commentary, that these beach films did not really "need any indication to locate them in the continuum of American art," and that the "final judgment of whether or not they were true art must rest with history." The audience accepted it all as a gleam in the eye of a Larger Consciousness, something beyond both the niggly backbitting of the Cahiers du Cinema auteurs and the larger-than-life Pamela Mason Knows gossip columns of TV Screen and Movie/and. It was something that belongs to and proceeds from us all, like Grand Central Station.

In his presentation, Mr. Lawder made use of various slides from other media-painting, photography and sculpture. Can a slide of a moonstruck man in the nude be brought to bear on the artistic aspects of Annette movies? "Yes, yes, yes," he seemed to say. This might almost be a metaphor for the whole evening. Even if we make gestures like dressing up and having a film festival, we can never approach the essential aesthetic truth of what Annette has been and always will be. No single action or theory or moment can capture Annette, for she was, we were told, transcendent.

In his discussion of the "fluid acting styles" in this "timeless work," Mr. Lawder made us laugh, and then flinch just a little, by forgetting Annette's real name and calling her "Miss Crudinella" one minute, and "Miss Proxinella" the next. Here repeatedly referred to her as "Anita," which was really a bad mistake. Anita is Anita Bryant, as we all know, and Annette is Annette. It seems, in view of the fact that even a post-teen like Mr. Lawder had trouble with the name, that she might have changed it to Annette Fun, but perhaps that would nave hinted that these movies were not concerned with Art, but were merely entertainment. Which they are not.

Must a picture steer clear of fun things like surfing and drag-racing to be serious? Even Moby Dick has a few laughs.

Just before the film began, there was a standup group singalong of the Mickey Mouse Club Mambo and much discussion about whether the Mickey Mouse Club was or wasn't an allegory of Nazi Germany. One participant buried his head in his hands and spoke of "that horrible rodent Big Brother and those Brownshirt children obeying him and acting out his fantasies."

The rest of us, not concerned with what to do after our demise as Mouseketeers, or with whether we should carry an invitation to walk on the beach with Frankie (Avalon) to its illogical conclusion by mentioning marriage-("Let's go listen to the moon and leave these children," he says. "Until it's wedding bells, I'm children too, Frankie," she retorts.)-the rest of us, free from these considerations, were happy to be able to go into the deeper implications of the Funicellovian ethic.

One of the things about the movie that struck us all was how little there really was of Annette in it. But isn't that life? Aren't our lives merely films, purportedly starring us, in which we turn out to be playing bit parts? This is a film which asks questions: Which is better, surfing or drag-racing? Can coed nights on the beach coexist with chastity? Is the stuff of which evil is made a man or a Mouseketeer? Is God dead or what? And if "what," what?

The movie revolves around the surfer crowd, the Hell's Angels crowd, an English rock-'n'-roller named the Potato Bug and the older generation, embodied in the publisher of The Bikini Bugle. Frankie plays not only himself but also his rival, Potato Bug (as one might say colloquially, "he is his own worst enemy''), in the most telling intramural duality since the "Dialogue of Self and Soul" (W. B. Yeats). We are shown that fair (Frankie) is foul (Eric von Zipper) and that even foul is a little bit cute. Is Frankie the good guy standing there like an ad for men's underwear, eschewing cant and embracing good times on the beach, or is he a power-mad teenager declaring his manifesto: drag-racing is "the way we gotta live, that's what it's all about"? Even more to the point, is he the red-blooded American Frankie of Annette's dreams, or is he the pop-singing English Potato Bug of Annette's dreams?

Annette herself is a problematical heroine in this problem-movie. She is slightly apart-a girl among surfing, dancing, moaning teens, who is like a mad Hamlet commenting on the action, yet indeed doing very little to ruffle the meadow-muffin hairdo on her head. A bit ironic, something of a "goody two-shoes" even, she seems to be waiting for something, but what is it? Her songs give us a clue: "This Time It's Love," she sings-implying that last time it was just some sort of teenage infatuation. She does her singing on the beach, with the sunset (a sort of Gothic nightmare of vivid color) moving behind her in one of the technical low points of the film: we are meant to imagine that she is walking and the sky is standing still, not the other way around.

Annette is Everywoman. Her very Being is trying to tell us that even a rather ordinary girl can find romance. Love is not a beauty contest after all, and as evidence we note that there are other girls in the film who are far better-looking than Annette, who yet remain dateless and are, in fact, allowed only stingy consideration by the camera. These other girls are always frantically pursuing the Potato Bug and wildly frugging out their destinies, whereas Annette, though one of them, is far beyond that. She is asked to dance and refuses. Somewhere at home, we sense, there is a blondwood hope chest filled to the brim with His and Hers towels. The other girls are children; Annette is nearly a post-adolescent.

There is a good deal of discussion, nevertheless, of the puerile, the sophomoric and the jejune. Illiteracy is held up to scorn. At one point, one character accuses another of being a traitor: "You Arnold Benedict," he says, illustrating that a little learning is a dangerous thing.

Frankie, though not solely concerned with the belle-lettristic, is shown to be in at least marginal contact with Reason. We are shown that he has read T. S. Eliot when he echoes the poet's "All time is eternally present .. :" in his speech "All forever is right now." "Then what about tomorrow?" asks Annette. "That's the day after today," he replies, sensibly, showing that this boy knows the difference between literary sophisms and down-to-earth reality. Frankie shows us again and again that he is a Seer of some kind, a maker of distinctions. For example, in discussing the difference between surfing and drag-racing, he points out that "the ocean is wild and free, something you can't change. But this [car] is a machine."

Though we were not required to sign vouchers promising not to reveal the ending, I would rather leave it undisclosed. Suffice it to say that, unlike conventional tragedies, not all the characters die in the end. Indeed, none of the characters die in the end. Our protagonist and her date work out their individual problems and identities, and we have a closing scene which shows a lot of good-natured doing of the monkey, the frug and the jerk, with fleeting shots of Annette smiling and giggling the giggle of the just. A symbol of the fact that we're laughing with Annette, and not at her.
