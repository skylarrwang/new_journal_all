Outside, it started to snow. Big, wet, white flakes fell
silently on the few alumni who were not inside eating, ll
having drinks at Mory's with Old Blue classmates, or
maybe visiting the Yale Law Library's special exhibit,
"Remember When You Were Here."

Inside Commons, the bursary students hurried from
table to table in their white coats, clearing away the
plates before the awards and the speeches. But there
were more than a thousand people in the hall, and the
Yale Glee Club managed to get out three songs before
David Grimes, chairman of the Yale Alumni Board,
stood up and started the proceedings. After introducing
members of the Alumni Board and announcing the four
1967 Yale Medals for "outstanding service to the
University," he stood aside as President Brewster
stepped to the podium. Brewster waited for his
standing ovation to die down before he spoke. He did
not waste time getting to his first point.
"Someone has finally proved that going to college
doesn't necessarily make you richer,'' he said, his pause-
broken voice ringing in the microphone. "It's not a
guaranteed meal ticket." The laughter stopped almost
immediately. "Inherited symbols of success are up to
question. Today, it is very hard to make wealth or
power the criterion of work." The resulting attempt at
reorientation, he explained, has led to a "purpose crisisâ€¢
among students, particularly student activists. How
should the University act in the face of this crisis?
"There are those who would ask, 'Why doesn't Yale take
a stand on this, that, and the other thing?' " Brewster
spent the next fifteen minutes answering this question.
And he questioned the demands of the New Left that
Yale not allow recruiters from the Dow Chemical
Company on campus; he questioned those who would
have Yale take a stand on America's involvement in
Vietnam; and he concluded that "only by indulging in
the right to be wrong can we build on the wrongs of the
past .... We should stick to our ancient task: equipping
each generation to find their own way, even if we can't
dictate that way--even if it means getting lost."

Just the other day, he told the alumni, he started
reading a book on Yale's legendary Dink Stover to take
his mind off the terrible troubles of today's world. But
he couldn't. He found the same pattern in Stover as in so
many students today: "The self-conscious confidence
bordering on arrogance-the rejection of the whole
establishment." Many old grads nodded; they knew
what he meant. And again, Brewster got a laugh from
the past. "I found it there in Dink Stover-the rejection,
the disillusionment. You might say, to use today's
jargon, that he went to pot." Laughter, even some good-
natured hisses: yes, that was it, wasn't it? And hadn't
Kingman just assured them, really, that at least Yale
wouldn't join the ranks of the dissenters, the wave-
makers who threatened to swamp the honest, hard-
working citizens of America?

And Yale had its worries, too: Reverend Coffin's
activities weren't doing the Alumni Fund any good. "I
understand what he's doing," one of Brewster's
assistants had said a few days earlier. "I'm not at all sure
I agree with him, but I do wish he wouldn't do so much.
He's upsetting the alumni." While Brewster kept his
promise to wait and see what the courts did before
taking any action against Coffin, the letters kept pouring
in. And although the Alumni Fund kept growing year
by year, wasn't it true that the total growth had dropped
from $700,000 in 1966 to $50,000 in 1967? It was,
and to reach the disgruntled grads, the Alumni offices
had to develop "a rifle-shot rather than a shotgun
approach," in the words of managing director Ogden
Sutro. Whenever a letter of dissatisfaction was received
it would be answered immediately. If the writer was a
potentially large donor, an extra special effort would be
made to put the whole thing "in the proper perspective."

Brewster had finished speaking. Over a thousand
people stood up and those who knew it, who still
remembered it after all these years--remembered it after
the marriages, the wars and the obituaries--sang
"Bright College Years."

In after-years, should troubles rise
To cloud the blue of sunny skies,
How bright will seem through mem'ry's haze
Those happy, golden by-gone days!

And when it came time, the men held up their white
napkins, and waved them proudly in the air, and sang
" ... 'For God, for Country, and for Yale!' "


It was over, and hundreds of grads and their wives
streamed outside. No traces of snow were left; the sun
was shining in a completely cloudless blue sky. It was
almost warm as people made their way to their cars, or
to the panel discussion of student activism in Sprague
Hall, or to a walk around the campus. William Jordan,
Secretary of the Class of 1915, was grinning from ear
to ear as he walked outside. He held up three fingers.
Three people had showed up at his table. He was very
happy.


Nothing unexpected happened at the discussion of
student activism in Sprague. Kingman Brewster was
moderator. The panelists--Sanford Elberg, dean of the
Graduate School at UC Berkeley; John Kneller, dean of
the College of Arts at Oberlin; former News chairman
Strobe Talbott; and Assistant Dean John Wilkinson-
pretty much agreed in their prepared remarks that
student activists were responsible citizens after all.

The questions that followed from the audience were
on the whole more interesting than the answers, which
tended to be vague or inconclusive, and the audience
reaction to the questions was the most interesting of all.
Questions like "Well, how would you quell student
demonstrations without using hoses and tear gas?" or
"Okay, Strobe, could you tell us how you would get us
out of Vietnam?" or "Isn't it true that demonstrations
force opinions on people, rather than using peaceful
means, where opinions have to be accepted?" received
vigorous applause from the audience. But "Well, how
do you test a law without breaking it and thereby render-
ing yourself ineffective to fight it?" did not.

Moderator Brewster summed it all up at the end with
a personal observation: "As one whose patience is
sorely tried by some forms of civil disobedience, and
whose legal sense is outraged by it, I still am grateful
that dissent exists."

It was getting dark when the doors of Commons were
opened for a reception of the Alumni Board and the
Engineering Association. It was the last official function
of the day, and everyone came to have a good time and
soak up liquor and, if possible, introduce the missus to
President Brewster.

One alumnus took upon himself the responsibility
for grabbing and refilling Brewster's beer glass every
time the president emptied it. "It's your day, Kingman,"
he would beam each time. "I know," Brewster kept
saying. Once he laughed, "Well, I'm glad it's my day,
and not Senator Dodd's day."

After speaking to him briefly, two alumni and their
wives told Brewster how nice it had been talking to him
and then headed for the pretzel and potato-chip table.
"Isn't he nice?" one of the men asked.
"Yes, and so perceptive," his wife agreed and smiled
at the other woman. "Now where's Coffin?" Since the
reverend's appearance at the cornerstone ceremony, no
one had seen him.
"He had to go somewhere," her husband explained.
"Oh, what a shame." She sipped her bourbon.
"Personally," she confided to the other woman, "I think
he's great, but he" -nodding at her husband-"goes
along with Charlie O'Hearn."

The previous Monday night, Charles O'Hearn,
Assistant to the president, had addressed a large
gathering at the Football Banquet. Reverend Coffin
had attended the banquet, but by the time O'Hearn rose
to speak Coffin had already left for a teach-in on draft
resistance. "I know you all agree with me," he had said,
"that you'd much rather read about Yale on the sports
page, with a winning football team, than on the front
page, criticizing the Vietnam war or the draft." O'Hearn
had received an enthusiastic ovation.

President Brewster was sipping beer and talking to a
student who was telling him about a letter he had
recently received from his father. His father, who had
graduated from Yale thirty-five years before, had
written, "Trying to impose one's views on others by
causing mass disobedience is the opposite of the
democratic system .... I feel this so strongly that I do
not propose to continue my support of Yale after my
present pledge is completed, nor would I have anything
to do with anyone who disobeyed the draft law." The
student asked Brewster what he thought about alumni
like his father.
"There are a lot of them," Brewster answered. "But
obviously we can't put this place up for auction. We
can't let an alumnus with a lot of money blackmail us
into accepting his views." He took a sip of beer. "A lot
of people agree with Bill Coffin, and a lot of people
disagree with me for not firing him. But the final
decision is up to the trustees, not the alumni."

He raised his eyes from his beer. People around him
had been leaving, and now only a few grads were left
in Commons. Even these were emptying their drinks
and collecting their wives. They would head to dinner
and then perhaps to the hockey game or the basketball
game, and then they would go home.

It had been dark for half an hour, but the flag
outside Commons was still flapping in the wind. The
night was cold. A guard untied the rope at the base of the
flagpole, blowing on his palms to keep warm.

An alumnus, standing in the doorway, called out to
the guard, "It's been dark for a while, you know."
"I know. I'm sorry, I've been very busy. Alumni Day
and all." He lowered the flag slowly and tucked it under
his arm.
