One alumnus took upon himself the 
responsibility for grabbing and refilling 
Brewster's beer glass every time the 
president emptied it. "It's your day, 
Kingman," he would beam each time. 
"I know," Brewster kept saying. It was 
Alumni Day.

Without slowing for a girl who had just stepped off the 
sidewalk, the maroon Cadillac turned the corner 
smoothly and sped up Wall Street. The girl swore as it 
passed her; then, noticing that people were watching, 
she shrugged and crossed the street, trying unsuccess-
fully to keep her hair from blowing into her eyes. Up 
Wall Street, the chauffeur was having trouble opening 
the car door and keeping his hat from blowing away. 
He succeeded, and an old man and his wife climbed out 
onto Beinecke Plaza. 

They stood there blinking in the wind while the 
chauffeur clambered around on the back seat. He 
emerged with several heavy boxes, and gave them to the 
old man, who headed slowly over to the Beinecke Li-
brary with his wife. "That's Mr. Altshul," the chauffeur 
explained. "He gives books. God, he must be Class of 
'98," he laughed. 

It was Alumni Day, Saturday, February 17, 1968, and 
everyone had come to give something, or remember 
110111ething, or just to laugh and drink and eat pretzels 
with old classmates and maybe talk about Reverend 
Coffin and the War. 

Mr. Altshul plunked the boxes down on the front 
desk. The head librarian hurried over, wearing a blazer 
-tth a big gold-and-blue Yale emblem on the pocket, 
IDd kissed Mrs. Altshul's hand. "Let's go over to the 
cornerstone-laying ceremony," he said, "or we'll miss it.'' 

A auard led the three into the vault elevator, and the 
' heavy metal doors slammed shut. The elevator took 
them downstairs, where they would make their way 
through the underground corridors to the scene of the 
ceremony across the street. 

"Books," said the guard, opening one of the boxes on 
the desk. "Beautiful French books.''

It was just after 11 o'clock when the 12-piece Yale 
Band struck up "Bulldog·• to begin the cornerstone-
laying ceremony, the first scheduled event of the day. A 
platform was set up under an elm tree near the edge of 
a huge pit, where tractors had been busy pushing d~rt 
asound for months to clear the way for the foundations 
of the new six-story Becton Engineering and Applied 
Science Center. More than a hundred Old Blues and 
their wives had gathered to hear President Kingman 
Brewster and Henry Becton himself dedicate the new 
building. But first, with the wind blowing in his eyes, 
Reverend William Sloane Coffin stepped to the 
lllic:rophone to give the invocation. 

.. 0 God," he read from a sheet of yellow paper which 
, bad been folded inside his pocket, "0 God, when 
ICience can greatly bless or wholly destroy, grant that 
1l'hile never opposing the truth of science, we may never 
fear to so beyond it, lest at the first step we be free and 
at the second enslaved.'. His voice echoed from the 
loudspeaker onto the cement walls of Strathcona Hall, 
IDd back. "Through the work of this building, through 
Ill all. Lord, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done. 
Amen." He sat down and then Professor Peter Wegener, 
chairman of the Department of Engineering, rose and 
called it "a great day for Yale industry.'' 

President Brewster was next. He was in top form. 
"I note in reading the history of this enterprise" 
-spreading his arms to mean, not just this enterprise 
here, bm Yale, man-"that this school was once housed 
on the fourth floor of the chapel. You can see, 
Mr. Becton. what difficulty that would arouse today." 

Everyone laughed: it was the spirit, the wind pushing 
around the leaves and the dirt, the sun reflected from the 
big brass trombone; it was even the way Coffin hunched 
!tis shoulders to the wind and laughed. By God, Yale 
could laugh at itself. 

Henry Becton rose to speak, and everyone found 
himself standing to applaud the man who had given 
$4,700,000 to make the new Engineering Center 
possible. He was brief and to the point, saying that he 
had done what he had done "through a slow brain-
washing process.'' Again the standing ovation, the 
wooden chairs scraping the gravel, and Brewster was 
laughing and shouting, "We need an engineer!" as the 
men on the platform prepared to seal the cornerstone. 

Someone put the box in, the metal box which, if opened 
several generations of Yale men later, would reveal 
several yellowed copies of the Yale Daily News, a 
couple of books about Yale, the 1968 University 
Catalogue, a program of events from Alumni Day, 1968, 
and some weathered photographs of North Sheffield 
Hall, Winchester Hall and Henry Becton, smiling into 
the camera a little self-consciously. 

But now Becton was laughing genuinely as he held 
the trowel in his hands, scooping soft cement into the 
cracks of the cornerstone and trading jokes with 
Brewster and reporters. He gave the trowel to Brewster, 
who continued sealing the plaque into place. Coffin 
leaned over the railing and stage-whispered to the crowd. 
"Kingman just made a mess!" He went to get a 
closer look, then ran back to give his report. 

"Old Silver Trowel. He just spilled it all." Only a few 
people sitting in front could hear him; the others 
wondered what Coffin was doing, running back and 
forth, wondered what Coffin was saying that caused a 
few people in front to laugh. Then Brewster gave him 
the trowel, and he took it laughing and plunged it into 
the cement, and maybe wondered what it was like to 
be a bricklayer.

President Brewster ordered another vodka martini 
and turned back to the woman at his side. She had 
been talking to him for several minutes, ever since he 
had entered the President's Room upstairs in Woolsey 
Hall. It was the noon reception for Yale Medal 
recipients. "Of course he can do the work and all, but, 
well, I'm not sure he'd be happy here. He's pretty 
dependent. I guess." Her voice trailed off as Brewster 
thanked her and turned to speak to someone else. He 
glanced around the room and smiled. Under the big 
domed ceiling an increasing number of alumni and 
wives were milling and chatting and gravitating to one 
of the bars set up at either end of the room. "Isn't it 
splendid?" one women called out to Brewster. "It sure 
is," he agreed. 

In the doorway, a small man with only a little hair 
left was puffing on a Kent and talking with a student, 
both waiting for lunch to be announced. "Well, I 
generally try to keep up with things around here," he 
said. " I don't live far away. Matter of fact, I guess the 
only time I didn·t show up here in the last fifteen years 
was two years ago when my wife was driving me home 
from the hospital.'. He eyed the drinks other people were 
holding. but didn't get one himc;elf. "My name's William 
Jordan. I'm Secretary of the Class of 1915.1 guess that 
seems prehistoric to you, huh?" The student smiled 
noncommittally. "Well, it is. Only, we manage." He 
frowned. "But this year, it looks like there'll only be 
two of us at the table.'' He took a drag from his 
cigarette. "There are a hundred and fifty of us left, but 
only two of us at the table.'' 

As a waiter walked through the President's Room, 
ringing the bell for lunch, William Jordan filed down-
stairs with the rest of the people and headed for his 
table in the immense Freshman Commons.
