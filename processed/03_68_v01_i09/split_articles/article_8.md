-..s through life, or the psychological 
llipna of being an outcast; of people 
llaanted in hundreds of ways by that 
lia8le experience of the bomb. 
Lifton was shocked and profoundly 
lllaken by what be heard, but he forced 
himself to concentrate on distinct patterns 
IIIII in time he began to notice that a 
process of distancing-what he calls 
1fYChic numbing-set in within himself. 
In the fall of 1962, he went back to 
Tokyo to research some special Hiroshima 
problems, and then returned to the United 
Slates. He employed a Japanese assistant 
10 continue doing research for him while 
lie himself worked in this country on the 
Hiroshima manuscript and a related manu-
aipt on death symbolism and the impact 
tl nuclear weapons. He finished the 
Hiroshima work toward the end of 1966. 
Death in Life: The Survivors of Hiro-
liima was published earlier this month by 
lmdom House. It is a moving and brilliant 
.-lysis of human reaction to a cataclysm; 
il is also a pioneering effort in what is 
coming to be called psychohistory.

PJom the mass of information he col-
lected in interviews, Lifton identified five 
..m traits in the Hiroshima survivor's 
peychology. 
The first was the death imprint. This 
..Wted from the individual's first shatter-
ina and then recurring contact with death, 
iacluding fears of radiation effects. T he 
sarvivor tended to regard himself as weak 
llld victimized, and was looked on as an 
outcast by other Japanese. Many survivors 
WOUnd up with an absolute sense of 
delolation and despair. Shortly after the 
llcmb, an abandoned mother heard a 
IIIDor that no trees would grow in 
Hiroshima for seventy years; then her 
lilt possessions were stolen from the rail-
way c:ar in which she was living. She told 
Uftoo of her reaction: "But my feeling 
..., there was no place to go ... so if I 
were to die, it was all right, I would die 
llere where the bomb fell .... A feeling 
tl DOt caring-not a feeling based on 
llderstanding but just on not caring .... " 
The survivors also experienced death 
lfllh. An elderly lady, carried to safety 
alta the blast in a wheelbarrow, told 
Uftoo: "I heard many voices calling for 
llelp, voices calling for their fathers, voices 
of women and children .... I felt it was 
a wrong thing not to help them, but we 
were so much occupied by running away 
Garlelves that we left them .... Even now 
htill hear their voices." The unspoken 
lilt-accusation was that her life was saved 
• the expense of others. 

Another protective mechanism, that of 
111chic closing-off or psychic numbing, 
11ft the survivors unable to feel emotions. 
AJapanese army officer who directed mass 
Cftlnations said: "After a while [the 
'*Jiles] became just like objects or goods 
-handled in a very business-like way. 
·· ·We had no emotions. Because of the 
llccession of experiences I bad been 
!~~rough, I was temporarily without 
leetinl." 

Almost all the survivors were wary of 
re..terfeit nurturance; they felt the need 
tf lpecial attention, yet at the same time 
'-J resented and suspected it. Said a 
~ 
scarred hospital attendant: "I 
~'t like people to use that word 
~auh~] ... to refer to u~ as. at?mic 
maadens is a way of dascrUDJna-
... · . . "Yet she also said: "We under-
"'- such a terrible ordeal : .. we experi-
enced a state between death and life ... 
so I wish others to have a more sym-
pathetic understanding of us." 

Lifton found that the survivors resented 
Americans in direct proportion to the 
extent that the bomb bad marred their 
lives. In some cases, resentment and affec-
tion existed together because of the 
American Occupation and events after-
ward. 

The final psychological trait was 
formulation. The survivor tried to create 
a new life; he again sought a sense of 
development and significance in his life. 
But finding this sense proved extremely 
difficult. A feeling of special mission or 
some form of resignation seemed to be the 
only means. 

Lifton examined artistic creation, which 
is one kind of formulation. He found most 
of the literature and art relating to the 
bomb to be unsuccessful because the artist 
was unable to master such a catastrophic 
experience . 

Lifton found close parallels to the 
reactions of Hiroshima survivors in the 
reactions of concentration camp survivors. 
He went on to conclude that we are all 
survivors of both those massive holocausts 
and, in a sense, of imagined future 
holocausts. While the central psychological 
problem in Freud's day was sexuality, 
the problem today, according to Lifton, 
is "unlimited technological violence and 
absurd death." 

Lifton was dealing with an historical 
problem in his book, but he approached 
it with the insights of a psychoanalytic 
perspective. His basic aim was to 
illuminate the historical subject matter 
in terms of human psychology. This is 
psychohistory, and it is Lifton's primary 
intellectual concern. He doesn't believe it is 
possible to understand large human events 
without understanding psychological 
forces. In his own life, Lifton has found 
himself in various situations in which 
both dimensions were extremely impor-
tant, and it is from such a perspective 
that he carries on his work.

Robert Jay Lifton grew up in New 
York City in a family that stimulated 
him to make his first contact with 
psychological and political matters at an 
early age. H is father bad grown up on 
the lower East Side and had hoped for 
a medical career but, lacking funds, had 
turned instead to business. He always 
took pride, however, in having read widely 
in the major thinkers as a very young 
man, and be always cared deeply about 
the underdog; certainly at least part of 
Lifton's- impulse to examine major 
historical problems arises from his 
father's influence. 

In high school, Lifton was interested 
in history: at Cornell, which he entered 
at 16, he became a pre-med student. 
He started New York Medical College at 
the age of 18. By the second year he 
wanted to be a psychiatrist. He bas never 
regretted his medical background; 
internship, in particular, offered him a 
special kind of human confrontation at 
the border of life and death. Lifton, 
immersing himself in his psychiatric 
studies in the immediate post-war years. 
tended to annoy teachers by insistent 
questioning, and even then to show himself 
as something of a loner. 

Then, be says, "Lots of things happened 
strangely." He enlisted in the Air Force 
in 195 1 and was stationed with a group 
A Yale Institution for U pperdassmen

of psychiatrists at Westover Field when 
order came to send of their number 
overseas. The head psychiatrist decided 
that the unmarried man should go, and 
that was Lifton. He asked to be sent to 
Paris, but was assigned intially to Japan. 
By this time he had married, and his 
wife, who had been working in television, 
arranged for press credentials and 
accompanied him. 

After a year in Japan, Lifton was sent to 
Korea, where he was the only Air Force 
psychiatrist in the country. He flew on a 
circuit from base to base, trying to deal 
with a large number of psychiatric 
problems. He attempted to find a way for 
the personnel to continue to function in 
the combat area; if there was no way, he 
arranged for their return to Japan. 

After five and a half months on the 
circuit, he was ordered back to Japan; 
he- returned to Korea for Operation Big 
Switch, the prisoner exchange in 1953. 
His wife accompanied him as a correspon-
dent. He had been briefed in advance 
to expect some "ideological influence" 
(brainwashing) on the returning Gl's; 
but interviewing and conducting group 
therapy sessions with them, Lifton 
found something puzzling and disturbing 
in the confused state of many of the 
returned prisoners. He saw this condition 
as important both clinicaly and as 
part of a larger historical problem. 

Finally discharged in Japan, Lifton 
and his wife started on a round-the-
world trip. Hong Kong, their second 
stop, seemed to the Liftons mysterious 
and unreal, with an extraordinary air of 
intrigue and ferment. Lifton talked 
with many people and began to hear 
dramatic stories from Chinese and 
Westerners who had been imprisoned 
in Red China. The problem of thought 
reform-brainwashing-began to absorb 
him, especially the puzzling state of the 
former prisoners-of-war. With no 
clearcut notion of establishing a new 
direction of research, with only the 
knowledge that the work would be very 
important, Lifton arranged to study the 
former prisoners in Hong Kong. Of these 
two years, Lifton says with a smile, 
" It was the voyage of the Beagle for 
me, my turning point." 

As Lifton talks about that period in 
Hong Kong, it takes on the quality of 
a single memory held intact. The draining 
emotional confrontation with the 
former prisoners, the frenetic search 
for information on Chinese history 
and culture, the life in Hong Kong itself-
all are part of one experience. He 
would leave his apartment in the morning 
and drive to an outlying section for an 
intense two-hour interview with a 
just-released missionary, later drive to 
the beach and change for a swim, then 
spend the afternoon talking with experts 
and the evening studying in his apartment. 

Lifton and his wife left Hong Kong 
in 1955. During the next four years of 
teaching and research, in Washington, 
D.C., and then at Harvard, he was 
writing his first book, Thought R eform 
and the Psychology of Tota/ism: A 
Study of Brainwashing in China. He 
defined totalism as "a tendency toward 
ali-or-nothing emotional alignments." 
From the case histories of 25 Westerners 
and 15 Chinese, he abstracted the major 
totalist devices used to "re-educate" 
(make over in the communist image) the 
former prisoners. He also described how 
"thought reform," if successful, closes 
the subject off and reinforces totalist 
inclinations within him. He made it clear 
fhat total ism or elements of totalism are 
not the province solely of communism, 
but appear also in our own society. 

Lifton was also concerned with a more 
general problem, the human capacity 
for change. He argued that a person 
is in process, that change-moderate, 
not extreme-is vital. 

In writing this book Lifton confronted 
a large number of problems-an alien 
culture, the intellectual attitude be 
would take toward reform, his own 
radical liberal ideological position, and 
the choice of a particular psychoanalytical 
tradition to follow. 

<;>n returning from Hong Kong in 
1956; Lifton joined the Washington 
School of Psychiatry, a group influenced 
by the American psychoanalyst Harry 
Stack SuiJivan, who had made a special 
contribution to the techniques of the 
psychiatric interview. While in Washing· 
ton, Lifton read an article on ego 
identity by the psychoanalyst Erik 
Erikson. He realized that Erikson was 
concerned, in a theoretical way, with the 
same problems of personality change 
that he was confronting in the "re-edu· 
cated" former prisoners. Lifton was suf-
ficiently excited to ask Frederick Redlich 
(now dean of the Yale Medical School), 
whom Lifton had met in Korea, to 
arrange an introduction. 

Lifton went to see Erikson at the 
Austin Riggs Clinic in Stockbridge, 
Massachusetts. Erikson was intrigued by 
thought reform, and he felt it tied into 
Young Man Luther, the book on which 
he was then working. That book, which 
appeared in 1958, is subtitled "a study 
in psychoanalysis," and it is the work 
that effectively introduced psychoanalytic 
methods into the study of history. 

Since the death of Freud, there had 
been a shift among some psychoanalysts 
from exclusive preoccupation with the 
id and the domain of the unconscious 
to a corresponding interest in the ego, 
the conscious self. Since ego patterns 
persist into adulthood and are available 
in historical data, this approach offered 
a way to deal with an individual in his 
social and hi~torical environment. This 
sort of concern with identity had a 
special impact on Lifton, and Erikson·s 
notion of the phases of development 
and the life cycle related particularly to 
Lifton's concern with character change. 

Lifton moved to Harvard in 1957. 
There he studied China and the Orient 
under John Fairbank and Benjamin 
·Schwartz, and was influenced by sociolo-
gist David Riesman. Another influence. 
though less direct, was that of Albert 
Camus. Lifton felt that Camus was strUt 
gling on a philosophical level with the satot 
problem at human possibilities and 
change that he himself was studying on 
a psychological level. 

While in Boston, Lifton underwent 
personal psychoanalysis as part of his 
training to be a psychoanalyst. He 
completed the analysis, but not the 
training, because he felt that it wasn't . 
relevant to his work, and he held certalll. 
reservations about the way psychoanal)~ 
is utilized and taught. 

The historical profession showed 
its first awareness of the contributions 
available from an understanding of 
psychology in 1957. In that year, diplo-
matic historian William Langer used t1Je 
occasion of his president's address to tbC 
American Historical Association to saY

that, were he beginning his career anew, 
ar 
be would pay considerable attention 
to psychology, "to the urgently needed 
deepening of our historical understanding 
tbrough exploitation of the concepts and 
findings of modern psychology." 

This decade has seen a few more books 
and several conferences on psychohistory. 
Perhaps the most important single step 
was taken by Lifton and Erikson in 1966, 
d 
when they decided to form what is now 
called The Group for the Study of Psy-
chohistorical Process. It is an informal 
group that meets in a cottage next to 
Iifton's summer home in Wellfleet, 
ical 
Massachusetts. It met for seven days in 
1966 and five days in 1967. Its members 
include Erikson, Lifton, psychologist 
Kenneth Keniston and historian Lawrence 
~ Chisolm (both from Yale), psychiatrist 
Robert Coles, psychologist Frederick 
Wyatt, sociologist Philip Rieff, historians 
Bruce Mazlish and Frank Manuel, politi-
cal scientists Suzanne and Lloyd Rudolph 
and critic Steven Marcus. 

Works in progress are presented and 
discussed, and ideas are tested. Lifton 
1e 
presented sections of the Hiroshima manu-
ICript, and Erikson sections of the biog-
raphy of Gandhi he is now writing. 

Lifton says, "These meetings are a most 
icb 
extraordinary experience intellectually. 
tic 
You're throwing your work out to really 
lifted people who immerse themselves in 
il and respond with great sensitivity." 

1n addition to the survivor, Lifton has 
recently identified another type of man 
which he thinks is a particular product of 
this historical era. This type is protean 
man-that is, a man subject to several 
major changes in his life patterns and 
ideology. Protean man is part of Lifton's 
focus on the changing personality that 
began with his brainwashing study and 
included the study he was doing on 
Japanese youth prior to the Hiroshima 
work. Lifton thinks universal psychologi-
cal tendencies, the cultural past and the 
current historical trends interact to pro-
duce human behavior. He thinks that the 
third factor is responsible for protean 
man, and he points to two reasons: the 
historical and psychological dislocations 
associated with rapid technological change, 
and the overwhelming output of mass 
media.

Lifton looks forward to "psychohistori-
cal breakthroughs." These breakthroughs 
will represent the coming together of the 
individual and history, and will produce 
a new dimension of psychic experience. 
The aim, finally, is to find a model of man 
within history. 

Lifton acknowledges that major difficul-
ties lie in the way of these breakthroughs: 
the psychoanalyst tends to extract the 
psychological self from the historical 
process, while historians look toward a 
sequential model of group behavior that 
ignores individual psychology. But Lifton 
believes that the gaps can be bridged, and 
le 
he is willing to predict the characteristics 
of psychohistory: 

I A model of time expanded to com-
bine and give subtle expression to 
man's individual and collective feel-
ings toward pis past and future. 

2 A genuine dialectic between the in-
dividual man and his historical 
process. 

3 An idea of the past built upon a 
three-way interplay between the in-
dividual psychology, the cultural past 
and the existing historical trends. 

4 A dialectic between the reality of 
external events and man's need to 
see these events through some form 
of symbolic re-creation (formula-
tion). 

5 A stress on man's innate need for ex-
ploration and change, at the same 
time recognizing the counter-trend 
toward stability and stillness. 

Now completing a manuscript on the 
general symbols of life and death that is 
related to the Hiroshima book, Lifton says, 
"I'm strongly convinced that I'm moving 
in a very important direction, but I do 
have lots of doubts, including many about 
.my own capacity to be equal to the prob-
lems involved." 

There is no question that the problems 
of psychohistory are large, but Lifton has 
already done much to meet them. His own 
work has proved that the psychoanalytic 
perspective can greatly enrich and enlarge 
our understanding of both individual be-
havior and large historical events.
