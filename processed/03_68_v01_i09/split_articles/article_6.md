Death in Life: The Survivors of Hiroshima
by Robert Jay Lifton, Random House.

The all-clear sounded at 7:30 on the
already hot morning of August 6, 1945;
and the city, tense from the air-raid warn-
ing that had been given twenty minutes
before, was now able to relax. A few
minutes after eight, three American B-29's,
initially mistaken for reconnaissance
planes, appeared over the city. Seconds
later, an atomic bomb exploded.

A brilliant flash of light cut across the
sky. A history professor, who had been
walking absent-mindedly along a dusty
road, climbed to the top of Hijiyama Hill
and looked down. He was shocked by
what he saw, more shocked than by any
of the suffering he witnessed afterward.
"Hiroshima didn't exist," he later wrote.
"That was mainly what I saw-Hiroshima
just didn't exist."

A few more days passed, another bomb
fell on Nagasaki, and the war was over.
The Americans came, they gave the
Japanese a new constitution, and the new
Japanese government provided small pen-
sions for the hibakusha, as the survivors
of the atomic blasts came to be called.
Hiroshima was rebuilt, and eventually
next to the Peace Dome, a relic of a de-
stroyed exhibition hall, a nine-story office
building rose up. Both the Americans and
Japanese provided medical treatment
for the hibakusha. The "Hiroshima
maidens" were brought to this country by
private charity to have their scars covered
over by plastic surgery, and the Ameri-
cans in particular began a systematic
study of the physical effects of the bomb.

Very quickly the world came to know
what one atomic bomb, equal to 20,000
tons of TNT, could do. With temperatures
up to 6000Â° C. at the target area, it could
kill somewhere between 78,000 and
200,000 people over a period of time; it
could destroy two thirds of the buildings
in a city; it could cause violent, disfiguring
burns called keloids. Its unseen radiation
could settle over the survivors, increasing
the incidence of cancer and leukemia.

But what of the effects of atomic war-
fare upon the minds of the 290,000 people
officially classed as survivors? In the
period immediately after the holocaust
John Hersey wrote Hiroshima, the story
of six survivors. Little happened after that.
The Japanese government, in allocating
pensions, paid little heed to the mental
condition of the hibakusha; the American
researchers concentrated on the physical
consequences. No one seemed to care what
these extreme events could do to the
psyche. "Do you understand?" wrote a
Nagasaki physician. "Have they investi-
gated what it does to heart and conscience
and mind of those who survive? Do they
have any knowledge of our society of
spiritual bankrupts, now striving lamely
to function as a community?" There was
no answer.

Then, in 1962, 17 years after the atomic
bomb, a tall, intense psychiatrist named
Robert Jay Lifton, who had written a
major book on Chinese brainwashing and
had just been appointed to a new research
professorship at Yale, came down by train
from Kyoto to Hiroshima. At this point
he had been in Japan for two years, inter-
viewing Japanese youth for a study relating
individual psychology to historical pro-
cesses. He had thought about the bomb
during those two years, but only occasion-
ally, and he had never before visited
Hiroshima.

Drawing him to Hiroshima, however,
was the dawning realization that though
his subjects in Tokyo and Kyoto did not
talk at any length about the atomic bomb,
still it had left a tremendous imprint on
their individual lives and their culture.

Lifton arrived in Hiroshima in early
April, bearing letters of introduction to a
cross-section of intellectuals and com-
munity leaders and planning only a short
stay. He was immediately struck by the
rebuilt city, still living with its A-bomb
memorials and memories. "The war is
over and has been over in Japan for a long
time," he said later. "It's past history and
that's the way it's treated, but that wasn't
the way it was treated in Hiroshima. There
the bomb was alive and it was with the
people, with the city."

Lifton discovered that no systematic
study had ever been done on the psycho-
logical reaction to the bomb. He went
back briefly to Kyoto, and then returned
to Hiroshima. Sometime before his second
visit to Hiroshima, Lifton had decided to
study the psychological effects of the
explosion. Contributing to the decision
were Lifton's personal and professional
interest in the Far East and Japan, his
interest in studying human reactions to
extreme historical situations and his
concern with the psychological factors in-
fluencing war and peace.

Lifton stayed in Hiroshima for six
months, interviewing two groups of sur-
vivors-33 chosen at random and 42
chosen for their leadership among
survivors. Finding them was not easy.
With his Japanese assistant he spent many
hours that hot summer, searching out
the dwellings of the hibakusha whose
names they had found in the files of the
Hiroshima University Research Institute
for Nuclear Medicine and Biology.

The interviews, usually lasting two
hours, were held in Lifton's office, or in
the home of the hibakusha if he was sick
or elderly. Though he knew some
Japanese, Lifton relied on a translator.
At least two--and sometimes many more
-sessions were held with each of the
survivors.

Lifton focused his questions on three
aspects: the survivor's memory of the
original experience and its meaning to him
17 years later, his residual concerns and
fears, and his inner struggle to master
his experience and come to terms with his
hibakusha identity.

Lifton had imagined that he would find
many horrors, but he discovered that
there is a great difference between imag-
ining and actually confronting horror in
direct human terms. Every story was
different. Lifton heard of encounters im-
mediately after the bomb---children
burned black, a child by the side of its
dead mother, a corpse with the flesh
burned off; of families severed forever
by the blast; of a daughter sent away to
the country because her dying father
smelled too much; of people afraid to
marry or, if married, afraid to have
children; of children born deformed; of
a woman breaking out in red and yel-
low and black spots a month after the
atomic bomb and then dying; of people
bearing the stigma of the vicious keloid
