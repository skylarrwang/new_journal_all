**Times are Changing at Yale**
**Author: Susan Braudy**
**Page number(s): 2, 18**

Times are changing at Yale. Take the basement room with crumbling wicker furniture that was once the women's sanctuary in Sterling Library. This room was the feminine counterpart to the Linonia and Brothers library room upstairs. "L&B," as Linonia and Brothers is known to the regulars who sleep on its leather couches, was closed to women until four years ago. Women did their light reading down in the basement next to the ladies' toilets.

Today, this basement room still lies directly under L&B in the tradition of the Martha Washington Bridge, but it has been modestly refurbished in dinky Danish modern. And Yale's lucky ladies have had four free and equal years in L&B.

Yes, times are changing. Though not too quickly. Take the Elizabethan Club, which is fondly called the "Lizzie" by its regulars. Unsurprisingly and in the Yale tradition, the Lizzie-an ornate shrine to Queen Elizabeth, matriarch of an era-invites male members only into its white clapboard house on College Street.

Women may visit on rare occasions, visit and not join, the Lizzie to partake of its refined atmosphere. They may visit on weekends, as guests of members. And on spring weekends, they may sit, quietly, in the back yard.

"What is a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?" silently asks Her Majesty from a gold-framed oil painting above the voluptuous spread of soft cookies, dainty watercress sandwiches on crustless rye and steaming lapsang suchong tea brewed a point.

"Madam," I say to the Queen, decorously lowering my mental voice as I walk across the carpet to her table spread, "Madam, I am here in the Elizabethan Club as a humble voyeur, a tourist, a guest of a member." I listen to polite sloshing sounds made by Lizzie regulars, the afternoon tea drinkers.

"Mercy, this strained tea droppeth as the gentle rain upon my waistcoat," says an elderly indolent voice wearing an exquisite glen plaid suit with an English cut. A gentle rumble of laughter follows his remarks. T-groups among the teacups, at the Lizzie. If music had been playing, it would have been a mincing eighteenth-century minuet. The gentleman clad in glen plaid sits with a group of four who look like the Mighty Carson Art Players on the Tonight show playing elderly Oxonians for the insomniacs of America.

My tale's end must be foreshadowed at this point. Six important facts. (I) Following my entrance I feel a long silence with paranoia licking at its edges. This is a cold winter's afternoon, a Monday afternoon. (2) And my undergraduate host, a new member, has failed to notice the sign at the door of the club. The sign, visible to members only, reads: Curb Your Girls. (3) But I pragmatically ignore the silence. I pour the steaming, fragrant tea into my cup, load my saucer with sandwich cookies and nod to Her Majesty in Her gold frame. We share a kinship, a rapport. For we, of course, are the only females in the place. (4) I follow my host into the adjoining room.

This room is different. In it sit three undergraduates. The atmosphere, heavy compared to any other undergraduate hang-out, is buoyant compared to that in the first room. (5) A senior reads aloud from a Punch article on drug culture innuendoes. Another, who uses twine instead of shoelaces, guiltily washes down six watercress sandwiches with three cups of tea. He has slept through lunch, he explains between bites, and plans to go back to sleep again sometime before dinner.

(6) Then out of the silence in the next room, the steward of the club appears. "I'm sorry," he announces to the far wall, "no women allowed on weekdays."

Says my host, "Does that mean-ah, er, ah." "What does that mean?''

Answers the man, still addressing the wall, "You may stay, sir, but the lady, she must go."

Says my gallant host in ringing tones, "Then I will go, too."

Then confusion, followed by an embarrassed and kaleidoscopically hasty exit. I did not get a chance to return my cup and saucer to the table or even to say goodbye to my new friend, the Queen.

Gentle ladies, I have since fumed and fussed, but to no avail. I have asked close friends to resign quietly from the Lizzie to protest my forced exit. "I knew when I joined," said one close friend, "that women were not allowed in on weekdays. Why should I quit?"

Said another, more militant friend in the legal profession, "To be absolutely correct, before you begin any litigation, you'll have to test this female exclusion clause. Your host will have to escort a peahen, a doe and a lioness to the Lizzie on successive winter Mondays. Your whole case rests on whether the only females they mean to exclude are the human ones or not."

I have spent long hours thinking things over. Gentle ladies, progress is a possibility. Remember L&B. Times are changing. The only male in favor of women at Yale couldn't be the foot nibbler in the library stacks. We have the power.

So here's my plan. On Monday of next week, at 4:20, we meet at the corner of College and Wall. We march down to Elizabeth's Restaurant and go right inside, past the tea drinkers and cookies dunkers and right up to Lizzie herself. And we sing out, "You can get anything you want at Elizabeth's Rest-au-rant." If one of us does it, they'll think she's sick. If two sing it together in harmony, they'll begin to worry. If three do it, they'll think we're an organization. And if four do it, ladies, they'll know we're a movement.


**Slavery**

The subject of discussion was certainly an interesting one, even if it was a little vague. You drove up to Northampton on February 9, expecting that the symposium at Smith College on "American Negro Slavery: Modern Viewpoints" would provoke scholarly discussion and perhaps philosophical dispute that might relate the historical problem of slavery to the current dilemma of race. Such a link-up did in fact take place, but it happened, as it finally turned out, as much by accident as by design. It was a subject, then, in which you had a part, both as a student and as a citizen (if the word may be used)-a subject, moreover, which took on a patina of glamour when you learned who had come to talk about it.

Among the participants was the well-known young Marxist historian, author of The Political Economy of Slavery, Eugene Genovese, now teaching at Sir George Williams University in Montreal, who a couple of years ago, while at Rutgers, became embroiled in a nasty controversy testing the bounds of academic freedom. It began with his advocating, in class, the now not-so-unthinkable overthrow of the Saigon regime. Richard Nixon said Genovese should be fired.

Also present, on Friday night, was William Styron, whose The Confessions of Nat Turner has dragged him into a largely pointless controversy with black militants who think that both Styron and his book are racist. In addition, David Brion Davis, a teacher at Cornell and the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning study The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture, spoke on Saturday afternoon. There were eleven other historians present, some not as "well-known" as others, but they all had sharp axes to grind and generally seemed to know how to use them.

Four negro historians had been invited, including John Hope Franklin of the University of Chicago, but none could attend. And Harvard's Robert Coles, the author of Children of Crisis, had to back out at the last minute because of another commitment. These cancellations did not, however, prevent the affair-headlined "Negro Symposium" by the Smith College Sophian-from being, in the eyes of many, Smith's event of the year.

Several television cameras were trained from different angles on Eugene Genovese, the first speaker, and on the four panelists sitting beside him. The cameras remained throughout the conference, all-seeing yet unobtrusive, save for the faithful, finally irritating ultrasonic whistle they emitted-the sound you hear, for example, if you turn on your TV set and keep the sound off. An aspect of the situation perhaps less easy to get used to was the number--one might say the sheer weight--of girls. Smith is, after all, the largest womens' college in the world, but the fact remains impersonal, an abstraction, until you sit down in the midst of about a thousand of them and open your eyes. If, when this happens, you have steeled yourself with the love of learning, the effect is, at the very least, distracting: if you are unprepared, the effect can be paralyzing. You were inclined to believe that rarely, if ever, had such a mass of femininity and such a concentration of brain-power been in the same place at the same time.

Genovese's talk, entitled "Slave
