The symposium's final address was 
given by David Brion Davis, who holds, 
as some people noted with amusement, 
The Ernest White Professorship of History 
at Cornell. His talk was concerned principally with abolitionist attitudes towards 
slavery, and he described in detail what 
many Northerners in the first half of the 
Nineteenth century believed to be a 
"Slave Power Conspiracy." Davis quoted 
Theodore Parker's likening the paranoid 
fear of slavepower to the Jesuitical terror 
of the anti-Christ, a concept rampant in 
Europe for three hundred years after 
the Reformation. 

So ended the Smith College Symposium 
on slavery. Many afterwards were jubilant 
about its liveliness, its variety, and its 
timeliness. Others were as sympathetic to 
what had been attempted, but less satisfied 
with what had taken place. They felt that 
perhaps it had been a case of too many 
celebrities in too short a time. At moments, 
professional competition seemed to get in 
the way of the panelists' pursuing the 
clarification of common problems, and in 
a couple of instances the bickering of the 
panelists became uncomfortably personal. 
They, along with the militants in the 
audience, tended to corroborate a point 
Lionel Trilling made a long time ago, 
that "our culture peculiarly honors the 
art of blaming." 

However, forbearance, good word 
though it is, is not something you can 
expect to find when a lot of intelligent men 
and women get together to discuss a difficult 
subject, particularly if the subject 
is as hydra-headed as American Negro 
Slavery. Certainly a great many people 
were stimulated, shaken, and enlightened 
by what they saw and heard at the sym-
posium, and that is no mean accomplishment. 

It may have been true, as an onlooker 
not unkindly remarked, that "there's 
less here than meets the eye." But all in 
all, "less" was more than many had experienced in quite a while.


**Mr. Mayor**

Mr. Mayor 
Jonathan Aaron 
Graduate student, English 
Watching John V. Lindsay talk to Thomas 
P. F. Hoving on the Mayor's Sunday conversation show, one realized that Hoving 
was the original Lindsay man: discreet 
club ties on those shirts that have handmade buttonholes, fifteen inches of un-
wrinkled sock encasing the Anglo-Saxon 
calf. And that man had been a commissioner in city government. Sure, he was 
not more than socks and shirts and ties-
he gave us kite-flying in the Sheep Meadow 
and bicycles on Sunday and the poised 
fullness of touch that puts a man in 
"Talk of the Town" one week and inspires 
a lavishly whimsical cartoon the next. 

On Sunday the striking thing was not the 
ideas, but the way he made them dance 
lightly across the table. Doubtless he 
knew that comment, honed and un-
adorned, would be bad form amid a studio 
done up in Public Relation Man's Plastic 
smoothly polished version of Modern 
Art. 

But, in the studio confusion of 
swinging cameras and hissing klieg lights, 
his manner was the striking thing: the almost lyric indifference to the staged situation 
he was in. The PR men circulated 
through the audience giving skittish house-
wives from Queens punchy questions for 
John Lindsay and his guest, and proffering, 
yet again, one of their number decked out 
in beard and bells who wanted to know 
what the Mayor was doing for the sad lost 
girls from Great Neck searching for 
flowers in the streets of New York. A regular balanced ticket. All the while Hoving 
ticked off on his long fingers the plans 
for the Temple of Dendur and the dialec-
tical advantages of hanging the F-111 
opposite the Poussin. It was a clear profile 
of style: the conquering indifference to 
indifference. 

He had finished the Temple of Dendur 
and the Mayor caught the falling syllable 
of conclusion, swung his attention from a 
card-waving aide and, with hardly a pause, 
asked about the exhibition on Harlem 
and the relation of the Museum to the 
community. The Director replied gracefully 
and persuasively. With a bright smile 
and a quick sense of the hour, the Mayor 
asked about the program in Brooklyn. 

A structured reply. The Mayor moved 
smartly to audience participation. (Apparently not much had been done for 
Queens or Staten Island and no one was 
getting up an exhibit on the Catholic 
contribution to the city.) 

Lindsay's technique was more in the 
dramatic than the lyric mode and his role 
the more difficult one. Of course, on your 
screens at home it was as taut and grace-
ful as the Brooklyn Bridge. But out there 
where it was at, the temporary crowd were 
all shifting on their folding chairs, straining 
to piece together the flow of talk as 
the cameras swung and bobbed and 
bothered us and made a work of art and 
artifice. Lindsay was with us in it, snatch-
ing a phrase here and there to keep the 
Hoving doll moving forward and keeping 
an eye cocked for the elusive aide. 

It really wasn't easy. After all, as host and 
speaker he had to gather us all into the 
occasion, playing both audience and participant, the listening citizen as well as the 
upright Mayor and the warm associate. 

It all needed a lot of props-the PR men 
in the audience searching out the Negro 
to put a question about Harlem and the 
aides with their cue cards and funny earphones and the make-up and the water 
glasses tinted yellow and the cordial pre-
show greeting to the eager admirers in the 
studio. We all assisted with timed clapping 
and nervous smiles as the eye of history 
swept us into our final perspectives and 
all our hundred mothers in the Greater 
Metropolitan Region caught a glimpse 
of our untidy hair and fluttering hands and 
flimsy chairs. It was exciting. He was our 
Mayor and he'd stood up to the garbage 
men and we were proud-and we were 
on television. And, Jesus, when you're on 
television you forget to do your thing 
and you just hope your voice won't break 
when you get to ask your question. And, 
Jesus, why doesn't he stop rattling on about 
Brooklyn-we all want to get in on this 
thing-and then about taking the riches of 
the Museum to every borough and the 
gleam of the untraveled world .... 

"Tom, I think we should cut it off here. 
I'm sure the audience would like to put a 
few questions to you. Yes, miss." 

"Mr. Hoving, why did you leave public 
service just at the time ... " 

Lindsay catches the cue and trades a 
few jabbing quips about the job at the 
Met being public service and goes through 
the bit about civilization in the city. And 
yes, yes, you're in on it; you're there, and 
the minute it's over you dash out of the 
studio to phone all your friends to watch. 
There it is on the videotapes of posterity 
-the urban and the urbane and being 
close to the Mayor and standing up to the 
garbage men and New York and-geez, 
it was grand.
