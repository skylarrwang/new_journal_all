of this virus or perhaps the stress of losing your job 
could manifest itself in a relapse.” If someone living in 
New Haven is dealing with mental illness and is both 
unemployed and uninsured, the chance of them seeing 
a clinician to help them cope with their trauma is often 
“next to none.”


It is precisely this population—unemployed and unin­
sured individuals—that organizations like HAVEN Free 
Clinic seek to serve. HAVEN is a student-run clinic that 
provides all of its patients with medical, legal, and social 
services, including behavioral health care, completely 
free of charge. Although it is student-run, a panel of 
professional advisors supervises each department to 
minimize patient harm and ensure that the rigorous 
standards are met.


Crystal Ruiz, a second-year Masters of Public Health 
candidate in Social and Behavioral Sciences at the Yale 
School of Public Health, is one of the co-directors of 
the clinic’s Behavioral Health Department, or BHD, a 
relatively new addition to HAVEN. “Because HAVEN 
serves a population predominantly made up of Span­
ish-speaking refugee immigrants,” remarked Ruiz, “it 
became clear that they were struggling with a lot of 
trauma, a history of traumatic events that they didn’t 
have any outlet for.”


It can sometimes take months to see a mental health 
professional, said Ruiz. But at HAVEN, people “can 
come in and request an appointment with us weekly, 
and we can see them a lot sooner. If they do require a 
higher level of care, then we refer them to one of our 
partnering institutions like the Hispanic Clinic,” Ruiz 
explained. BHD’s volunteer training program reflects its 
goal of providing more accessible care. The department 
is inspired by Indian psychiatrist Vikram Patel’s philoso­
phy of making up for a dearth of mental health services 
by training community members as “lay practitioners” 
to deliver psychosocial interventions for mild mental 
health issues.


This commitment to community engagement is at 
the core of both Ruiz’s work at HAVEN and her studies 
“For people who have substance use dis­
order [or other mental health conditions] 
and haven’t been able to get their treat­
ment or see their provider, the stress of this 
virus or perhaps the stress of losing your 
job could manifest itself in a relapse.”

at the School of Public Health. After switching from 
an undergraduate program in biochemistry to one in 
medical anthropology, she was “exposed to a lot of the 
intersectionality that is present in health care,” which 
encouraged her to learn about “why certain immigrant 
and refugee communities develop, not necessarily men­
tal disorders, but adopt behaviors that create opportuni­
ties for harm.”


Her academic interests, along with a desire to find 
community within a school that does too little for the 
underserved populations in New Haven, drew her to 
HAVEN. In a city where 44 percent of Latinos either 
received postponed care or no care at all for a health 
condition in 2018, Ruiz is disappointed that she always 
sees the impetus coming from students. Given that Yale 
is a predominantly white institution, however, she is 
not surprised. “It was just weird being presented with a 
really amazing opportunity—studying at the School of 
Public Health—but then not being able to contribute 
anything to the community.” Considering the amount 
of physical and economic resources that Yale takes 
from New Haven, Ruiz wanted to find a way to give 
back, and one of those outlets was through HAVEN. 
“I thought it was great because our main population is 
Spanish-speaking. They’re usually Latinx [community] 
members, and that’s [...] my community, who I identify 
with. Being able to provide direct care to people in my 
community makes me feel like I’m back at home.”


Insurance and a shortage of mental health services 
aren’t the only limiting factors to accessing care, how­
ever. Many living in low-income communities, Silva 
mentioned, also have unequal or sparse access to tech­
nology, which is especially harmful during a pandemic 
when mental health care has gone virtual. “Challenges 
include whether our patients even have access to WiFi,” 
Ruiz started, “if they have a phone that has the capac­
ity to support Zoom or support video conferencing, if 
they have unlimited versus limited minutes, if they have 
access to a quiet space to discuss some of their personal 
medical concerns.”


Both Silva and Ruiz supervised a transition to tele­
health due to the ongoing pandemic. While HAVEN’s 
IT team was able to quickly set up HIPAA-compliant 
communications systems for the clinic as soon as Gov­
ernor Lamont hinted that clinics would have to close, 
virtual health care presents a new set of problems. “It’s 
very hard to see certain signs and symptoms via a laptop 
or a phone screen,” Ruiz said. Some changes in therapy 
have been more prominent. Silva recalls that, in recent 
sessions, “a lot of our time was spent on just checking 
in on people coping with COVID: Do they physically
