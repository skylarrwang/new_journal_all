into this scant set of guidelines. This is where the mod­
eration gets fun, S. told me.
S., a junior at Princeton, has been a Librex moder­
ator since April. He entered the volunteer role after 
responding to a Librex posting by Schiller advertising 
open moderator positions (posts made by Schiller and 
other affiliates of Librex are signed with a gaudy purple 
script font “– The Librex Team”). S. interviewed with 
Schiller via the matching feature—anonymously, of 
course—and was accepted shortly thereafter.

Speaking to me through the phone over background 
sounds of his sister playing “Für Elise” on piano, S. told 
me that when a post is reported, it is brought to the 
moderation team for debate. In a Facebook group chat 
alongside twenty-three other volunteer moderators from 
across the Ivy League, S. argues for why or why not a 
post should remain up. The two dozen mods—which 
Schiller told me represent a diversity of socioeconomic 
statuses, countries of origin, political viewpoints, and 
races (over half are PoC)—can debate for hours whether 
or not a post is against the rules.

If there’s too much disagreement in the text chat, 
the moderators will have lengthy video calls. Schiller 
explained to me that the team has built a sort of case 
law, whereby they compare reported posts with past 
decisions in an effort to maintain a consistent modera­
tion scheme. And when Schiller recruits new modera­
tors, he sometimes gives them sample moderation ques­
tions to see how they respond. 
A favorite of his, he told me, is whether or not you 
remove a post claiming that “all men are trash”—a 
question that Facebook used when they were first creat­
ing moderation standards. “There’s no right answer to 
that necessarily,” he told me,  “although I think there 
are better answers and worse answers.” 
The founder said that he would likely message the 
user to let them know that the proclamation is not the 
kind of discourse expected on Librex and the post would 
likely be removed “because it’s a sweeping statement 
against a core identity group.”

Schiller often benchmarks his moderation practice 
against Facebook’s: in another instance, he justified 
that a Holocaust-denial post should remain up by say­
ing “even Facebook allows it.” A disgruntled moderator 
quipped: “ah yes let’s take our moral cues from daddy 
zuck.”

The whole operation has an air of professionalism 
to it until you look at the moderation chat itself. In a 
series of screenshots leaked by ex-moderators, we get a 
glimpse of the post evaluation process.

Before even examining the substance of the chat, 
another detail jumped out at me: pseudonyms the mod­
erators had given each other. There is, for example, 
“Grandmaster’s Padawan,” (S.’s name) “Grandmaster 
Big Brain,” “EtErNaL🍆,” and “Daddy,” which is, unsur­
prisingly, Schiller. The nicknames are transient, con­
tinually edited and tweaked by the moderators: at one 
point Schiller becomes “papi.” “The moderators can be 
silly sometimes,” he told me. 

The nicknames also hint at yet another layer of ano­
nymity, perhaps spurred by the worry that their identi­
ties will be revealed. After screenshots of the modera­
tor chat were first leaked to Twitter in late May by an 
ex-moderator from Dartmouth, there was a palpable 
fear in the chat. After Schiller informed the modera­
tors of the leak, S. writes, “Holy [new message] Shit 
[new message] @Daddy did I get cancelled.” Schiller 
(Daddy) replies, “I think ur ok for now.” A few messages 
later S.’s fear returns: “I’m gonna get cancelled.”

The content moderation chat brings to light the 
debates of what should be allowed to exist on the inter­
net, what is considered hate speech, what is said satiri­
cally versus seriously. These questions are asked behind 
closed doors, which Schiller explained to me is because 
“these are very sensitive issues and oftentimes issues that 
involve identity and involve how we see the world. And 
it’s important that our moderators feel like they are safe 
to actually speak what they think is like [sic] moral.”

The moderator chat, as Schiller described it to me, 
is a discourse unencumbered by judgement, a place 
where moderators feel comfortable to voice their true 
opinions while discussing the complicated politics of 
post removal. 

But an ex-moderator from Dartmouth, who left 
Librex over frustrations with the culture of the com­
pany, described that the chat is full of slights and disre­
spect. In a message they told me, “i started to get really 
tired of the job when there was a conversation in the

mod group chat about racist content and i asked if 
we should leave up racist posts even if they techni­
cally lie outside of the community guidelines and 
ryan said yes”—a discouraging instance given their 
impetus for becoming a moderator stemmed from a 
belief that maybe they could be the one to “change 
the content for the better & reduce the harassment/
hate speech.”

The ex-moderator expressed anger over an 
instance in which their moderation decisions were 
overridden by Schiller. In late May during elec­
tions for the Dartmouth Student Assembly, can­
didate María Teresa Hidalgo ’22 and her running 
mate Olivia Audsley ’21 were continually harassed 
anonymously on Librex. The Dartmouth reported 
they were compared to fascists and that one post 
“threatened to call Immigrations and Customs 
Enforcement on Hidalgo… Despite her own Amer­
ican citizenship.” 

After Librex announced that Hidalgo and Audsley 
did not qualify as public figures and therefore could 
not be targeted by name on the platform—a deci­
sion which took several days while the offending 
statements festered on the platform—the ex-mod­
erator began work on deleting the hurtful posts: “i 
started taking everything down (very relieved) but 
[Ryan] put back a ton of posts where only their ini­
tials were used.”

After being called “oversensitive for telling some­
one why the redskins logo was bad and promptly 
made fun of for defending [themselves],” they 
finally resigned as a moderator. “it was just like. 
why do i bother.”

In another instance in the moderator chat, the 
group discusses a post denying the Armenian geno­
cide. Grandmaster Big Brain takes a hard-line 
stance: “it’s not sexist, doesn’t attack a class, just 
reflects the poor state of historical education.” 
Another moderator responds, “it’s like… denying 
genocide.”

Big Brain retorts, “Yes, but it doesn’t go against 
the rules [new message] Trust me, I find it disgust­
ing—but at the same time we are not policing for 
facts.” 

Schiller affirmed this belief to me over email. I 
asked how Librex deals with misinformation and he 
replied, “In general, the Yale community is good 
at pointing out misinformation through comments 
and voting.” He believes in minimal regulation: 
falsehoods should remain on the platform and be 
downvoted to the bottom of the feed rather than 
moderated away.


Schiller’s platform allows Ivy League students to 
explore ideas and learn from each other, as many 
users told me. While matching with people, almost 
everyone I spoke with loved the app (selection bias, 
of course), and most accepted the trolling as a nec­
essary inconvenience.  
J., a Columbia student who quickly matched 
with my post soliciting user interviews, explained 
that he’d actually learned a lot from Librex and had 
his beliefs challenged and changed. He told me 
that as a Chinese-American, he often felt resent­
ment towards the ways affirmative action disadvan­
taged Asian-American college applicants, until he 
had some conversations on Librex that helped him 
build a more nuanced understanding of the lasting 
effects of slavery and prejudice against Black peo­
ple. “[Librex] helped me be more receptive and less 
apathetic and self-interested than I was before.”

Schiller’s quest to give students a platform for 
free speech and debate has been certainly realized: 
speech is definitely free, debate plentiful. But the 
extent to how far “free” should go, and whether the 
outcome of that decision is good, is another ques­
tion entirely. Although access to anonymous speech 
on Librex is spread equally across the Ivy League, 
the bigoted posts enabled by the anonymity tend 
target certain groups more heavily: Black students, 
overweight students, undocumented students, 
transgender students, among other minorities.

One critic of Librex, Anyoko Sewavi (Dartmouth 
’23), who posted a YouTube video in July reacting 
to racist Librex comments from other Dartmouth

students, told me that she initially witnessed produc­
tive discussions and believed anonymity was a “good 
concept.” But “then came the trolls.” Sewavi, who 
is Black, told me that “seeing that Dartmouth is the 
main school writing racist comments is just unnerv­
ing, it’s uncomfortable, and honestly it’s just exhaust­
ing to see…. I wouldn’t know if I walked across cam­
pus and someone felt this strongly about me being 
Black.” 

Our phone call finished on an optimistic note, with 
Sewavi explaining to me that the relatively small size 
of Librex enables opportunity for systemic change on 
the platform, and perhaps social media as a whole: “If 
they take trolling seriously, and there’s actual conse­
quences for these comments and actions, then maybe 
in the future it will snowball and set an example for 
other anonymous social media apps.” 

Others have also spoken out against the app, such 
as the actress Skai Jackson who posted on Twitter 
screenshots of Librex posts with the caption “This 
app is called Librex, so sad people are saying disgust­
ing things on here…” The attached posts claimed 
“Fellow racists. I have a plan to increase racism” and 
“Black people need to learn grammer [sic].” It’s hard 
to know if the posts were eventually removed.

Librex as a platform does not create the cesspools 
of flippant, divisive callouts that sometimes permeate 
its users’ devices. Rather, the anonymity gives these 
ideas a convenient breeding ground. The platform is a 
magnifying glass on the internet—a tangible diorama 
of the same behavior that permeates the bigger social 
sites. I recently came upon a post with 22 upvotes 
confessing: “For a forum filled with Ivy League kids, 
the content here is remarkably similar in quality to 
Reddit and 4Chan.” Yet this behavior feels much 
closer to home when we see it on Librex. We know 
that the content that so often ends up being debated 
in the moderation chat is made by the people that live 
around us, that attend class with us.

On Librex, offensive posts appear often—posts 
about why undocumented people should just move 
to Canada, or how the n-word “triggers libtards.” 
But despite the occasional moderation blunders, my 
experience browsing the app has gradually included 
less and less brazenly insulting content since I down­
loaded it in April. Perhaps the moderation team has 
honed their technique in an attempt to balance strict 
free speech and the app’s role as a useful and good 
platform. But the internet’s propensity to breed bigots 
and fuel flame wars, intensified by Librex’s feature of 
facelessness, may be insurmountable.

Schiller conceded to me that any online commu­
nity has its bad apples—a statement that felt a bit 
like admitting it’s the fault of the water and not 
the holes in the hull that causes a ship to sink. But 
when a leak does emerge and trolls inundate the 
platform, anonymity protects and emboldens some 
while others bear the brunt of unchecked speech.
