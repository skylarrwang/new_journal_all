ductive,” she said.
Joyce Wang ’17, a 2017-2018 Fulbright China 
participant, had loved her experience with Ful­
bright, during which  she researched mental health 
outcomes for “left-behind children” in Changsha, 
Hunan. “People in Fulbright understand that China 
can be the aggressor,” said Wang. “I am so angered 
and disappointed by the program’s cancelation 
because I don’t see the point of it. I don’t know how 
Fulbright China’s cancelation helps the situation in 
Hong Kong.”

But she’s inspired by the support gathering around 
Fulbright. A Change.org petition imploring the 
President to restore the Fulbright China and Hong 
Kong programs has accumulated 2,379 signatures as 
of September 5.

This year’s cohorts of Fulbright China and Hong 
Kong participants have been given the option of 
being reassigned to a different host country and have 
until August 21 to submit new proposals. Jin is con­
sidering the programs in Taiwan and Singapore.

“Honestly, Fulbright brings disproportionate ben­
efits to the U.S.,” Jin said. “In addition to academic 
exchange, it can use citizen diplomacy abroad to 
increase understanding of American culture, history 
and politics.”

As a Chinese-American, Jin is concerned about 
domestic anti-Chinese xenophobia, as well as 
zero-sum confrontation on the global stage. She 
said, “Ending Fulbright, a program meant to foster 
mutual understanding, it’s the ultimate sign that 
U.S.-China relations have reached a point of no 
return.”

From their homes in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen 
and New Haven, twelve Chinese students express 
to me that it’s getting harder for them to be in America, 
and to justify to themselves and others their desire to 
be in this country.

They are acutely aware of anti-Asian racism: every 
single one of them knows someone who’s experi­
enced it. Yao mentions an incident at Pho Ketkeo, 
a Laotian and Thai restaurant on Temple Street in 
New Haven, where a vandal dented the restaurant 
owner’s car and wrecked the windshield of a serv­
er’s vehicle in April. Like the server and restaurant 
owner, he suspects that the vandalism was racial­
ly-motivated, part of a larger trend of anti-Asian hate 
crimes increasing in the U.S. since the start of the 
pandemic.

Li*, a third-year graduate student at the Yale 
School of Medicine, has been the victim of two 
racially-charged events in the past year. At the end of 
March, a passerby who encountered Li on her walk 
back home from East Rock yelled, “Fuck you, stu­
pid Chinese people bringing the coronavirus here, 
go back to your country.” A year ago, on York Street 
in downtown New Haven, a man pointed at Li and 
exclaimed to the whole street, “A spy! A spy!”

These students were all enticed to come to the 
U.S. for different reasons: the promise of a liberal arts 
education, intellectual opportunities they weren’t 
exposed to at home, and a desire to broaden their 
horizons and see another part of the world. Now, 
many of them are exploring alternative plans in the 
event that U.S.-China relations worsen: Europe, 
Canada. Or simply going home.

Yao tells me that watching the two countries 
deepen their rift has been heartbreaking. He dis­
agrees with many of the U.S. administration’s immi­
gration policies, and opposes China’s recent actions 
against Hong Kong as well as the mass internment of 
Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. 
“The two countries I love, the two countries I want 
to make better, seem to be going the directions I 
abhor,” he says. “But what can I say, what can I do? 
There’s an old Chinese saying that humans do their 
best and leave the rest to the heavens.”
