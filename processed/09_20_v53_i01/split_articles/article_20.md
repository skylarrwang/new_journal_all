yer for Prisoners’ Legal Services of Massachusetts, these 
inspection scores don’t inspire confidence. 
“If you look across the board at ICE detention, even 
some of the ones that are considered the most dangerous for immigrants have consistently passed inspection 
year after year,” Paredes said. 
The Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit that 
researches mass incarceration, states that the ACA is 
“well known” for accrediting prisons despite reports of 
poor conditions. 
Asked about the primary purpose of Bristol County’s jail facilities, Darling said that they aim to provide 
“care, custody and rehabilitation.” A video published 
by the New Bedford Cable Network in 2015 suggests a 
different objective. In it, Charles Crowley, the sheriff’s 
late chief of staff, states that Hodgson’s goal is for people 
to “dread coming to jail.” Crowley says that Hodgson 
converted a gymnasium to a sleeping unit because his 
facility is “not a country club.” 	
Throughout April, Judge Young considered release 
requests from Bristol County detainees. Meanwhile, 
detainees developed statements about the conditions of 
their confinement, to be presented at a hearing in early 
May. But before the hearing, Sheriff Hodgson paid an 
inauspicious visit to ICE Unit B. 
On Friday, May 1, 2020, Sheriff Hodgson entered 
Unit B to separate a group of detainees for COVID-19 
testing. 
“I told them that it was critically important that they 
go down to be tested at our medical unit down at the 
main building,” Hodgson said at a press conference the 
next day. 
However, according to Alkalay, detainees had reason to believe that Hodgson’s visit was not beneficent. 
Alkalay’s clients told him that previously, detainees who 
were taken for COVID-19 testing were instead placed 
in solitary confinement. The Sheriff’s Office maintained that isolation was a public health practice and 
not a punitive measure. Darling said anyone who tested 
positive, was awaiting results, or displayed symptoms 
but refused testing was placed in medical isolation and 
monitored by health professionals. Notwithstanding the 
facility’s official procedures, Paredes said, “It’s pretty 
consistent... from all the individuals I speak to that there 
was this big fear of using COVID as an excuse to have 
people placed into solitary.” Fearing this isolation treatment, the detainees refused to leave the unit on May 1. 
While detainees were being summoned for testing, 
one of Alkalay’s clients, Marco Battistotti, called to tell 
him what was going on. According to Alkalay, Hodgson interrupted the call by taking the phone and grabbing Battistotti violently. In Hodgson’s telling, he only 
approached Battistotti after calling his name, and he 
denied physically attacking Battistotti. He claimed that 
the other detainees in the unit rushed at him and one 
person threw a chair. Afterwards, Hodgson left the room 
and gathered an armed team of corrections officers outside. 
At the May 2 press conference, Hodgson referred to 
Battistotti as a “con man” who “spends all his time on 
the phone talking to advocacy groups, pushing false 
narratives.” Vita described him much more modestly. 
Unlike many other detainees, Battistotti is fluent in 
English. “By default, he ended up in a position where 
he could communicate in writing and verbally with 
people who have authority over there,” Vita said. “The 
sheriff is not used to somebody being that forceful in 
pressing for rights and for accommodations,” so he 
identified Battistotti as someone to intimidate. 
Several minutes after Battistotti dropped the phone, 
another man picked up and told Alkalay in panicked 
Spanish that the detainees were being gassed. According to Alkalay, officers released tear gas through the air 
vents, deployed two stun grenades, and shot detainees 
with rubber bullets. 
Three detainees were hospitalized following the 
incident, including one who had a seizure and another 
whose breathing was obstructed by a rubber bullet in 
his throat. According to Rafael Pizarro, an organizer 
with Bristol County for Correctional Justice (BCCJ), 
the statements detainees had prepared for the May 
hearing “mysteriously disappeared” from their lockers 
following the confrontation with the officers. 
After the incident, Battistotti and the others who 
refused testing were put in solitary confinement. For 
three days, Alkalay says, Battistotti was left totally naked 
in an air-conditioned room. “I live ten miles from 
there,” Alkalay said. He sat in a well-lit office, in front 
of a framed painting of a sailing ship. “To think that my 
clients are being held naked for days…” he trailed off. 
“It’s just shocking, it really is.” Battistotti was in solitary 
confinement for sixty consecutive days. 
When Vita visited the jail, Battistotti passed him a 
small styrofoam cup to illustrate the food rations he was 
receiving. On it, Battistotti had estimated his servings in 
pen. About one third of the way up the cup’s battered 
side, he wrote “pasta.”

His cell in solitary confinement consisted of a bed, a 
cement desk and stool, and an attached toilet and sink. 
His quarters also included an additional ornament: a 
bullet casing. As Vita understands it, his client was 
taken out of his cell to shower, and when he returned 
the casing was on the floor. Battistotti had not seen it 
before he left, and he believes it was placed there as a 
threat. 
Before May 1, Battistotti’s English literacy had helped 
other detainees communicate their needs. Afterwards, 
the provisional community within Unit B was fractured. 
“I think one of the things that Hodgson was able to 
accomplish after May 1 was breaking up these groups of 
people and putting them in different units in the main 
building,” said Vita. “And I think that was intentional.” 
While Battistotti and other detainees faced isolation, 
activists outside the jail gathered to protest. BCCJ has 
opposed Sheriff Hodgson since the organization’s founding in 2017, and recently circulated a petition demanding that Hodgson take down the Confederate tie portrait 
in his office. Lindsay Aldworth of BCCJ asserted that 
Hodgson’s tie and the allegations of abuse in his custody 
are closely linked. “He cannot be wearing Confederate 
ties, he cannot be doubling down when asked about it, 
and he can’t be treating community members as he is,” 
Aldworth said.
Hodgson’s portrait sparked outrage in a county and 
nation already roiled by the killings of George Floyd, 
Breonna Taylor, and other Black Americans at the 
hands of the police. On June 18, BCCJ joined with 
Black Lives Matter activists for a rally in downtown New 
Bedford, where not for the first time, protesters called 
for Sheriff Hodgson’s resignation.  
Bristol County’s Black civil rights activists have historically existed adjacent to and in tension with the 
local incarceration system. Dr. LaSella Hall, president 
of the New Bedford NAACP, noted that New Bedford’s 
Ash Street Jail is the nation’s oldest operating jail, and 
the New Bedford NAACP is one of the organization’s 
older branches. 
Hall has thick-framed rectangular glasses and a piercing gaze even over Zoom. He described Hodgson’s tenure as one component of a criminal-legal system that 
has traditionally placed white men in positions of power 
and black men behind bars. “There’s no political will to 
get rid of [Hodgson],” Hall asserted. “Massachusetts is 
overwhelmingly white, and it’s overwhelmingly people 
who… don’t want to talk about [race].” If Hall’s assessment is correct, it might explain why Hodgson’s constituents are not up-in-arms about his role as an advisor 
to the Federation for American Immigration Reform, 
an anti-immigration organization the Southern Poverty 
Law Center has designated as a hate group.
Aspects of the May 1 incident stand out in the wake 
of the murder of George Floyd. Attorney John Swomely 
said that the detainees were made to lay on the ground 
with their wrists bound by zip ties. “There are detainees 
who, when dropped to the ground, had [correctional 
officers] hold them down by standing on their necks,” 
Swomely said at a May 27 webinar presentation. Paredes also heard that officers placed their knees on people’s backs and necks, evoking the restraint used to kill 
Floyd. Darling confirmed that detainees were zip tied, 
but denied that they were held down by their necks.
Four months after the incident, Battistotti remains 
imprisoned at Bristol County House of Correction. 
And five months after the first detainees were released, 
they remain under strict house arrest. In early August, 
the plaintiffs’ lawyers asked Judge Young to loosen the 
house arrest conditions. “It’s really difficult to not be 
able to even go and buy groceries for your family or go 
to a medical appointment without notifying the court or 
without notifying ICE,” Nimni said. 
Around August 23, officials placed Battistotti back 
into restrictive housing. Neither he nor Vita received a 
justification, but Vita suspects that the sheriff was retaliating against Battistotti for expressing his concerns to a 
DPH investigator earlier that month. Battistotti is still 
seeking release under the Savino lawsuit, but according 
to Vita, he is “very discouraged with the entire process.” 
Activists in and around Massachusetts continue to 
push for state and federal officials to sanction Sheriff Hodgson for the May 1 incident and the detention 
conditions in Bristol County. However, as the county’s 
electoral politics stand, the sheriff appears unlikely to 
be unseated. Even if someone were to challenge Hodgson, Hall does not expect a sea change at Bristol County 
House of Correction. “Let’s say you get a nicer guy, he 
takes down the Confederate flag,” Hall said. “Guess 
what? We’re still putting people in boxes.”
