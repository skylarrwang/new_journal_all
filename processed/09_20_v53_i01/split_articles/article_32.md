have any symptoms? [Are they] social distancing, mask 
wearing, [following] all the precautions? [...] We’re still 
trying to find the balance between that piece plus their 
ongoing treatment goals.”
Stigma surrounding mental health, especially in 
Hispanic immigrant communities, poses a significant 
challenge to providing effective virtual care through 
the Behavioral Health Department. State-mandated 
isolation and social distancing measures mean patients 
spend more time at home with their families, which 
makes talking about mental health issues more complicated. In Silva’s practice, many patients “enjoy coming 
to treatment and leaving their homes because a lot of 
their stress is related to their home environment.” The 
privacy and freedom to talk in the office is no longer 
there, which limits how much progress patients make 
on their treatment plans. At HAVEN, this manifests 
itself in limited responses on the questionnaires used 
to screen for symptoms of psychopathology: “There are 
some things you don’t feel comfortable saying around 
other individuals,” Ruiz mentioned. “Much of the time 
when they’re answering our questionnaires, they’ll limit 
their responses to yes, no, yes, no [...]. They don’t feel 
very comfortable with elaborating and providing further 
information.” Ruiz sounded tired over Zoom. After a 
long day of classes, coordinating BHD meetings, and 
participating in clinic-wide subcommittees for research 
and departmental enhancement projects, she understood that her clients were likely also overworked and 
still trying to adapt to the new telehealth system.

through, the city has slowly come back to life. Over 
the summer, a socially distant Wooster Square Farmers’ 
Market reopened, and medical students handing out surgical masks joined the protests against anti-Black police 
violence. At the Hispanic Clinic, Silva’s team modified 
an in-person group program with twice-a-week, three-
hour meetings for Zoom. “Once we were able to use 
Zoom to get the group going again, they advocated for 
stuff like more time and more frequent meetings,” said 
Silva. “There were definitely some bumps along the 
way, [...] but once they got connected, they absolutely 
loved it.” No matter the circumstances, people need 
to feel connected to each other. For Silva, there was 
a clear lesson learned: “Even if there is some discomfort in the process—like the technology piece—they’re 
willing to put up with that, to follow through with their 
treatment.”

Humans are naturally social creatures, but the pandemic has shown that they are adaptable, too. However, as the pandemic continues to rage throughout 
the country, mental health will not just be a priority—
for many, it will become a necessity for survival. 
In the aftermath of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, survivors experienced significant increases in 
sleeping disturbances, depression, and trouble coping with everyday life for years after the pandemic’s 
end, Norwegian historical demographer Svenn-Erik 
Mamelund conservatively noted in 2003. Psychiatric 
hospitalizations also saw an unexpected rise in first-time 
patient admissions in the following years. If past pandemic responses have any bearing on the future, current 
epidemiological trends show cause for concern. “Anxiety is way up, depression is way up, suicidal thoughts 
are way up, [and] using is way up,” said Scanlon. While 
it’s too soon to understand how much COVID-19 will 
affect mental health, one thing Scanlon knows for certain is that the psychological ramifications of the pandemic will persist well after we have a vaccine.
