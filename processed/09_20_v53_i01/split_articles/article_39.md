though she was near starvation. In the spring of 1945, 
the Russians liberated her and other Jewish prisoners. 
In 1948, Eva, then a 24-year-old Hasidic Jewish sur­
vivor of Auschwitz with shoulder-length dark hair and 
a shy smile, found herself in a displaced persons’ camp 
in Pocking, Germany. Her own parents had been gassed 
immediately on arrival in Auschwitz. 
At the displaced persons’ camp, she met a fair-haired 
young man named Chaya Rosenberg who was four 
years her senior. He was almost six foot one and Eva 
found him very good-looking. One Friday evening, she 
walked into his family’s room as they were preparing for 
the Sabbath. Years later, Eva told Esther that they were 
celebrating it in much the same way they did in her 
own home: a white tablecloth laid out, lighted candles, 
prayers recited. When Eva saw that Chaya had a home, 
parents, and a family, and were revelling in the “beauty 
of the sabbath,” she knew she wanted to marry this man. 
They got married during an “epidemic of marriages” 
in displaced persons’ camps all over Europe immedi­
ately after the war. Nash said that people were trying 
to recreate the family they had lost. Eva wore a white 
wedding dress with long peasant sleeves and deep skirt 
folds that were circulated among many brides in her 
displaced persons’ camp. The rings were second-hand. 
Chaya’s was engraved with somebody else’s name: 
Linda, inscribed with the date 07.01.37. 
Their wedding photo was taken in black-and-white in 
an area of the camp where weddings were held that the 
refugees called “Cafe Tel Aviv.” Fir trees decorated the 
backdrop. There was no bouquet, so Eva held potted 
flowers.
“My parents were traumatized people,” said Nash, as 
she looked at the photograph, now colorised and digi­
tized on her computer. “There was always the message 
that it was dangerous to be a Jew, but you should never, 
can never, give it up. It’s part of your identity and exis­
tence.”
Her parents arrived at Idlewild Airport (now John 
F. Kennedy Airport) in June 1949, carrying with them 
their Yiddish tongue, the trauma of the Holocaust, and 
their 3-month-old daughter Esther. Her father spoke 
no English. By then he had long been accustomed to 
working on the Sabbath because he had done so while 
working as slave labor in a special settlement near 
Novosibirsk, Siberia, and then on a kolkhoz in Tajiki­
stan during the war. When he arrived in New York, he 
continued to work on the Sabbath because he needed 
to make money. But every Sabbath, he would recite kid­
dush over challah and wine in a silver kiddush cup. On 
holidays and festivals he attended the synagogue across 
the street with his family.


For the first three years of her life, Nash only spoke 
Yiddish, the common language used at home with her 
Romanian mother and Polish father. Every Friday night, 
her mother would prepare a Sabbath meal—challah, 
gefilte fish, chicken noodle soup, roast chicken, and 
sometimes stuffed cabbage. Eva would light a cande­
labra with glowing Sabbath candles and recite bless­
ings. But there were many things her mother kept to 
herself—what happened in Auschwitz, what she had 
seen, what she had survived. “More was revealed in her 
inability to speak about it,” said Nash.


When the coronavirus began infecting scores of 
Americans and people worldwide earlier this year, Nash 
was not at all surprised, owing to her years of profes­
sional experience as a physician. But she had also grown 
up with the heavy lesson, first borne by her parents, that 
had prepared her for this.
“The pandemic showed that there was a chance the 
world could change in a heartbeat because it did for my 
parents,” she said one afternoon in July. “You wanted 
to know about how other such difficult times adapted 
Judaism—I would say it’s the reverse. Judaism allowed 
us to adapt to whatever times we found ourselves in 
because of the values, because of what it tells us about 
humanity, about people, about the tenuousness of life, 
and the important things.”


Three-year-old Ruthie Frosh loved to sit with her 
grandmother in the front row of the synagogue’s bal­
cony, overlooking the central nave, in Vienna’s sixth 
district. From that point, she could see everything—the 
beautiful neo-gothic architecture, the colorful stained 
glass windows, and the oil paintings in the interior. She 
could see the ark, the lectern and the Rabbi chanting 
from the Torah. On special Jewish holidays, her grand­
father would carry her in his arms downstairs and bring 
her to the Torah scroll. It is her first memory and the

the Pocking displaced persons camp in 1948.

one that she conjures today, as 89-year-old Ruth Weiner, 
and one that speaks to the strong sense of Jewish iden­
tity she had even at that young age.


She learned to read by age four, and by age five, she 
was reading the newspapers, finding out about “all kinds 
of stuff not appropriate to my age level.” When the 
Anchluss happened in 1938, she was seven years old. 
Germany and Austria had formed a union. Hitler and 
thousands of Nazis marched into Ruthie’s home city of 
Vienna and “the welcome could not have been more 
wholehearted or widespread or complete,” she said. 
Buildings were draped in red buntings with swastikas. 
In the streets, everybody was in uniform. 
“On that day I stopped being a child,” said Weiner. 
It became clear to her that to be Jewish meant you 
could be arrested or shot in the street for no reason, 
or made to scrub the sidewalks until your hands were 
bloody. She had to learn how to make herself invisi­
ble. 


One morning in first grade, a close friend came to 
school, looked at Ruthie, and spat on her. She said, 
“You’re a Jew. I didn’t know you were a Jew,” Weiner 
remembered. “That just slashed me to my core and 
made my new status very clear to me.”


In 1938, at first, young Jewish children could still 
attend public schools and receive Jewish religious 
education there. Ruthie learned Hebrew and prayers. 
Whenever Ruthie and her family went to the district’s 
elegant synagogue with its balcony and its bare-faced 
brick turrets, they were on guard. “There was a great 
sense of foreboding, you were prepared for something 
bad to happen at any point,” she said. Months later, 
during Kristallnacht, a brutal two-day pogrom target­
ing Jews, the Schmalzhoftempel synagogue would be 
burned to the ground.


Weiner explained that Judaism is a very portable 
religion, a characteristic that would become import­
ant later when she fled Vienna to England as a refugee 
child in the kindertransport, a rescue effort that trans­
ported 10,000 children from Nazi-occupied territories 
to safety just ahead of the war.
“Being Jewish goes beyond religious practice,” said 
Weiner. “Judaism is both a body of ceremonial practices, 
either in the home or in the synagogue, and equally a 
practice of everyday values, of how you see yourself in 
terms of what you expect of yourself, in terms of your 
own character, and more importantly how you interact 
with your community at large.”


On November 10, 1938, the day that would become 
known as Kristallnacht, Ruthie took two streetcars and 
walked four blocks to school in the Jewish quarter with 
her best friend, as she had done each day for months. 
Something was seriously wrong. Jews were huddled in 
streets filled with broken glass and crowds of people 
were throwing rocks. At 10 a.m., the teachers dismissed 
them out of a side door, ordering them to hold hands. If 
you see a group of more than two Nazis, cross the street, 
they told her. Stores were looted. Fires were burning in 
the street. That day, more than 91 Jews were murdered. 
All but one of Vienna’s synagogues were incinerated.


When Ruthie arrived home, her mother was waiting 
for her. By then, her father had been imprisoned for a 
month because of “political crimes.” A non-Jewish Nazi 
lawyer who was his father’s friend had protected him 
from being sent to a concentration camp.


Her mother rushed her into the house, past two 
Gestapo officers standing outside. Five minutes later, 
they heard an “unbelievable banging” on the door. 
Her mother made a motion for Ruthie to remain 
silent.	


For seven hours, they stayed seated in one spot, not 
making a sound, unable to eat or drink or use the bath­
room. Every half hour, the telephone would ring. Ruth­
ie’s mother was terrified, but remained silent: Was it a 
trick? Was it somebody in the family calling for help? 
She did not know what to do. 


By 9:30 p.m., the intervals between the pounding had 
grown longer. The phone rang and her mother finally 
picked up. The voice on the other end told her not to 
say a word. It told her to dress herself and the child. If 
she heard three taps on the door, it meant the gestapo 
had left and they could come out. It was the lawyer 
who had protected her father and was now rescuing 
them. That night, Ruthie shared a bed with the lawyer’s 
daughter, in his house.


Over the next few months, Ruthie’s mother worked 
on finding a way for them to gain entry into the United 
States. She managed to contact very distant family 
Ruth Frosh aged  seven and a half.

members—descendants of cousins of Ruthie’s grandfa­
ther—who lived in Texas. They banded together and 
issued an affidavit, promising to take on the responsi­
bility for financially supporting Ruth and her parents, 
should they come to the U.S.


Eighty-two years later, Weiner sat on an old sofa at 
her home in Bloomfield, Connecticut. At her age, she 
still has a twinkle in her eye and an exuberant energy 
in her voice. After all that she has witnessed, she said 
she still believes in God but that “I’m sometimes quite 
angry with him.” She has lived through periods of depri­
vation and rationing, learned how to make cake out of 
sweet potatoes for Shabbat when she had nothing else 
to use, and shared the last of her sugar with a neighbor 
because “that was just the thing to do.” In light of her 
experiences, she said that the inconvenience of the pan­
demic can be dealt with. “This is nothing compared to 
that.”


But she added, “I feel for people who are alone or 
are not in comfortable housing. I feel for the people 
who are experiencing illness or loss or deprivation, or 
who’ve lost their job.” She said that people reveal who 
they really are in times of crisis, pointing out that during 
the pandemic, some people truly rise to the occasion, 
such as her neighbors who offered to deliver groceries 
to her. Yet others refuse to wear masks, and some big 
businesses take advantage of  economic relief loans, yet 
fire their employees. 


“It is incumbent upon us to care for each other,” 
said Weiner. “This goes back to how the Jewish religion 
operates in times of crisis.”

3. Death
“Everything that is done in a Jewish funeral stems 
from the word respect,” said James Shure, a Jewish 
funeral director who works out of a Dixwell neighbor­
hood funeral home founded by his father. You do not let 
a person die alone. You light a candle near their head. 
In the pandemic, many family members could not enter 
hospitals to visit their Covid-infected family members, 
let alone sit by their side as they died. 


Each member of the chevra kadisha, translated ‘holy 
society’, looks more like a surgeon than practitioner 
of Jewish law when they enter the room at the George 
Street funeral home. They are volunteers who give their 
time and energy to do the tahara, or the sacred washing 
of a dead body, which is intended to return a person 
departing this world to the same pure, clean state they 
were in when they entered it as an infant. They wear 
face shields, masks, goggles, gowns and double-layered 
gloves. It is one of the greatest mitzvot, or good deeds, 
a Jew can perform. In the pandemic, the deed is even 
greater. 
“These people put themselves at risk without batting 
an eye,” said Shure.


After death, the body of a person who died from coro­
navirus might still be contagious, although scientific lit­
erature on post-mortem contagion is still nascent. Since 
the outbreak of the virus, the shomer, who watches over 
the dead body, has to stand at least 20 feet away from the 
body in Shure’s funeral home. 


As soon as the pandemic was declared, it took only 
two phone calls—one to California and one to New 
York—for Shure to determine how to carry out the 
tahara in a way that protects the people who are doing 
it while respecting the ritual and the dead person. The 
duration of the washing was halved. Instead of leaving 
an infected body on the washing table, they would be 
carried directly into the casket. But all the prayers are 
still said—prayers for forgiveness and prayers for eternal 
peace. 


Jewish burial law requires that the casket be lowered 
into the earth and covered with soil. They recite the 
Tziduk Hadin, a prayer, right after the grave is filled. 
They chant the El Malei Rachamim, asking for rest for 
the person’s soul. It is a moment of reckoning with the 
finality of death, Shure said. “It somewhat brings closure 
to the family to see the casket lowered and very often, 
that is when the family becomes rather emotional.” 
Now, safety regulations mandate that Covid patients 
have to be lowered prior to the family’s arrival at the 
cemetery. “It’s not cathartic,” Shure said. 


He has witnessed many funerals happen without 
those present being able to say the mourner’s kaddish, 
an Aramaic prayer that is often said at Jewish funerals. 
To recite the kaddish, a minyan must be formed, some­
thing not always possible with the Connecticut state 
rule allowing no more than ten people at a gravesite. 
“The kaddish does not mention death at all,” said 
Shure. “Rather, it installs and magnifies God’s name 
again as our world has fallen apart as we know it. We 
merely boldly, boldly, put our faith in God.”
