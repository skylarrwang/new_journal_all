branch until students returned in late August. “The 
store on York Street is highly dependent on Yale. It’s 
in the architecture library, which is closed. It’s in 
the midst of dormitories, which have been closed,” 
says Levine. Willoughby’s branch on Grove has a 
market including coffee-buyers across Connecticut, 
but its York Street location, like the Book Trader 
Cafe, still relies on Yalies for business. In the pan­
demic, Levine says, relying on this demographic “is 
just not a sustainable business model.” 


As we turn to the fall, many business owners find 
themselves at a loss. “It’s such a difficult time for 
anybody to know what to do,” says Willoughby’s 
Levine. Koffee?’s Goodall had considered invest­
ing in plexiglass to create little cubicles for Koffee? 
so that students could resume studying there the 
way they used to. But ultimately, it was much more 
expensive than Goodall anticipated. Unlike Book­
trader and Willoughby’s, Koffee’s Goodall has been 
exploring indoor options. “I’m hoping to open the 
doors for customers within the next month or so, 
before the weather turns,” says Levine. “But again, 
we’re only going to have seating for about 18 peo­
ple.” 


In college, students flesh out their niches with 
the coffee shops we frequent for hot beverages and 
studying. Memories form around seasonal drinks. 
Relationships flourish between us and the baris­
tas who witnessed us enter their coffee shops as 
first-years and walk out, into the world, as 23 and 
22-year-olds, a favorite cup of coffee in hand. It’s 
the fall of my senior year now, and the traditions 
I might’ve looked to––meeting friends to study in 
Book Trader, getting coffee and sitting outside of 
the Willoughby’s on York––seem like those of a far­
away place. In their place, I’ve had to make new 
traditions of my own, which has meant identifying 
roast names through conversations from 6 feet away 
at Willoughby’s, and finding out why some coffee 
demands heavy cream and others no dairy at all.


When I got back to New Haven after briefly vis­
iting family at the beginning of August, I saw that 
a friend who was passing through New Haven to 
collect their things had left me a gift: a small bag 
of Willoughby’s coffee. Anticipating a strange end­
ing to my time at Yale, they gave me some advice: 
“Drink lots of coffee – I finally bought you some 
from Willoughby’s.” My last first day of classes, I 
woke up early and made coffee in my kitchen. I 
pressed my nose into the still-fresh bag of coffee 
grounds, remembering briefly what it meant to be 
a first-year, so unsure of the world, standing outside 
the Willoughby’s on Grove street. It seems right to 
end this world where it began for me, with Wil­
loughby’s coffee. I make a note for myself: to buy 
intentionally from Willoughby’s and Book Trader. I 
know that if I want these local businesses to have a 
life of their own outside my sentiment, I have to act 
accordingly. It feels the most appropriate way to say 
goodbye: with a thank you.
