fter shuffling through some pages, Dr. Michelle Silva 
found the passage she was looking for. “Trauma waits 
for stillness,” she read. Silva is a clinical psychologist at the 
Hispanic Clinic of the Connecticut Mental Health Cen­
ter. The bookshelves in her office—packed with clinical 
files, tomes of Sigmund Freud and Ignacio Martín-Baró, 
refugee children’s books, and novels like American Dirt, 
from which she had just read—neatly framed her Zoom 
background. “Usually, people can find ways to cope and 
keep busy,” she said. “But isolation can be stillness in some 
ways—a forced stillness.” As a psychologist with an inter­
est in attachment theory and liberation psychology, which 
engages with themes like systemic oppression in marginal­
ized communities, Silva wondered how the current pan­
demic would complicate an already challenging mental 
health epidemic.


Quarantine, lockdown, and self-isolation, while 
essential to viral disease control, can be deleterious for 
mental health. Humans are social creatures, and the 
pandemic is forcing people to act against their survival 
instincts—to turn away from others. A recent epidemi­
ological review by Dr. Mahbub Hossain and colleagues 
reported that those quarantining in isolation suffer 
greater levels of anxiety, depression, trauma, and other 
adverse mental health outcomes.


On March 23, Governor Ned Lamont issued a state­
wide stay-at-home order. By early summer, New Haven 
schools and universities emptied. The streets were 
quiet, the silence broken only by police cars and their 
projected bilingual recordings of Mayor Justin Elicker 
urging people to social distance and wash their hands 
in both English and Spanish. Almost six months later, 
Connecticut’s consistent and precautious COVID-19 
response has placed it among three other states that 
are ‘on track’ to contain the virus. But the social and 
psychological repercussions of an indefinite pandemic 
have taken their toll. Although reports like those from 
Mental Health America rank Connecticut among the 
states with best overall mental well-being, the pan­
demic has had a deeper impact on the mental health 
of New Haven’s low-income, uninsured, and migrant 
populations, who already disproportionately endure 
psychosocial stressors.


The pandemic and the economic downturn it cata­
lyzed have incited skyrocketing rates of unemployment, 
income loss, and food and housing insecurity. Within 
the New Haven Latin American community that the 
Hispanic Clinic serves, legal status and loss of com­
munity only exacerbates patients’ daily trials. “When 
we think about legal status,” said Silva, “there’s a real 
investment, in the current context, for them to try to 
keep a low profile and remain invisible if they can. The 
pandemic has heightened that sense of separation, of 
isolation, and been really, really challenging for peo­
ple.”


Even procedures like contact tracing, which the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
has signaled as a key factor in slowing the spread of 
COVID-19, pose a perceived risk among undocu­
mented immigrants seeking treatment. A phone call 
asking an undocumented person whom they have been 
in contact with may force them to choose between their 
public health duty and their family’s security. Having to 
grapple with a choice between one’s health and legal 
status, on top of everyday financial stressors, can be an 
anxiogenic experience.


For Silva, seeing her patients struggle with these 
issues is particularly personal. Born to Ecuadorian 
immigrants in Connecticut, she grew up speaking Span­
ish and English. However, with her bilinguality came 
responsibility. Her mother has a chronic medical condi­
tion, and Silva often had to interpret interactions with 
doctors and medical staff. “Doing that cultural broker­
ing and being the oldest of two,” she said, “I very early 
on had experiences of what it feels like to try to access 
services, particularly health services and insurance, not 
knowing the language, and being constrained by things 
like medical insurance.” She feels that this has made 

New Haven’s low income, uninsured, 
and migrant communities shoulder 
the burden of extra mental health 
challenges during the pandemic.
