JULY
O
n the first of July at nine in the morning, President 
Salovey sends an email entitled ‘Fall 2020,’ announc­
ing that we’ll be returning to campus. It seems impossible. 
I can’t remember a time when my heart didn’t race when I 
left the house, or when I lived without the background noise 
of the hot, screaming TV. I think there’s something about 
staying inside that makes time feel completely stagnant, like 
you could wake up every morning for the rest of eternity 
and you’d still be stuck in the pandemic’s layers of forever. 
Going outside for runs and trips to the grocery store are my 
only reprieve. 
If anyone could tell me whether people felt like this 
before, it would be Judith Schiff. She prefers to talk 
on the phone, so I call her from the landline in my 
basement. Schiff is the chief research archivist of Yale 
Library’s Manuscripts and Archives and the city histo­
rian of New Haven. She grew up in New Haven, went 
to Hillhouse High School, and has been working at Yale 
for over forty years. 
Our conversation meanders. I ask one question, and 
Schiff slides seamlessly down tangents of history, often 
losing me in the enormous network of knowledge she 
holds. We talk about how Yale was founded, the origin 
of Skull and Bones, and what Yale school dances were 
like a hundred years ago. But eventually we make our 
way to World War II. 
World War II was one of the most recent instances when 
Yale’s campus was severely disrupted. Charles Seymour, the 
president at the time, supported the war, while many students 
opposed it, causing tension on campus. But when the U.S. 
finally entered the war, all students, regardless of their beliefs, 
were subject to the draft.
“Yale became a sort of ghost town,” Schiff says. “They only 
had enough students to fill two residential colleges, who were 
ineligible for the draft either because they were too young or 
they had disabilities.”
Many formerly enrolled students went elsewhere. Peo­
ple picked fruit on farms to keep up the food supply, some 
became firefighters, and others assumed civic positions. And, 
with students gone, Seymour offered up Yale’s campus as a 
military base. Over the course of the war, twenty thousand 
people came to Yale’s campus for training. Old Campus was 
rented to the Air Force, which trained at Tweed Airport in 
New Haven during the day and slept on campus at night.
“It was a constantly changing student body,” she explains.
When students finally returned in 1946, they called it 
“reconversion.” Seymour welcomed anyone who had sur­
vived the war and wanted to finish their degree back to cam­
pus. Overnight, Yale was transformed from a student body of 
thirty-five hundred to eight thousand students.
“They called any house in New Haven—do you have an 
extra bedroom? Can someone sleep in your basement?” 
Schiff tells me there were hundreds of cots in the gym and 
single rooms were turned into triples. Some of the students 
returning back to campus were married and had babies by 
this point.
“I remember meeting a woman who was married to a Yale 
physician,” Schiff recalls. “She had two babies in diapers in 
one half of a quonset hut on Science Hill.” 
I have to look up what a quonset hut is—it’s essentially a 
steel dome that looks like a can sliced in half. I’m trying to 
imagine hundreds of these semi-circles lined up on Science 
Hill and housing families with babies.
“Of course, there were no disposable diapers in those days,” 
Schiff laughs.

T
o my surprise, the layers of forever ease up and I 
return to campus. The day I arrive, my friend and I 
go for a socially distanced walk up Prospect Street and Sci­
ence Hill (I am relieved to see that there are no quonset 
huts). We pass fewer than twenty people. It’s strange to see 
Yale so quiet, to walk without weaving around people or 
having the usual litany of semi awkward run-ins. I miss the 
frenzy.
But it’s also fascinating to see campus like this. It’s as if Yale 
has been dropped and cracked open, like a fruit or a large 
glass jar. The shroud of isolation that usually encircles these 
eight blocks has been stripped away, and the pandemic has 
allowed reality to seep in. This is a quieter way of going to 
college, but in many ways it is a more grounded one, free of 
pretenses. My friend tells me that it’s been like this all sum­
mer, and that nearly everyone is seriously social distancing. 
My last interview takes place six feet apart on the chairs 
outside the Yale Art Gallery. I am late and he is early. My 
interviewee wears a green shirt and hat, and he looks strangely 
comfortable on one of the sidewalk’s stiff metal chairs, watch­
ing the cars pass on Chapel Street. He is eighty-five years old. 
Sam Chauncey became a Yale administrator when he 
was just twenty-one. He started as an assistant dean, served 
as Yale’s chief of staff for twenty years, and then founded the 
Yale Health Management Program, the first health/business 
program of its kind at a major university. Now retired, he 
advises students as a Davenport Fellow.
“For the first two and a half months, everything was shut 
down,” he recalls. “I could stand at my building and see all 
the way to Broadway and not see a single human being on 
the street.”
Chauncey’s voice is strong and clear, and if he hadn’t told 
me otherwise, I would have thought he was much younger. 
He smiles often, revealing two slightly crossed front teeth.
