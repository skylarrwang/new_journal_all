“It was great for everyone because you could walk without 
worrying that you’d run into anybody… I try to do six miles 
a day.”

The coronavirus pandemic is not the first pivotal moment 
Chauncey has witnessed at Yale. As chief of staff, he helped 
lead Yale during the radical movements of the nineteen-six­
ties  and seventies, and he contributed to both the admission 
of minority students and women into Yale. Chauncey is best 
known for his leadership during the May Day rally in 1970, 
during which twenty thousand to thirty thousand  protestors 
arrived on the New Haven Green to denounce the arrest of 
Bobby Seale, a Black Panther leader who was put on trial 
for allegedly murdering a fellow Panther member. This is the 
only time since 1950 when Chauncey recalls Yale shutting 
down.

“Every single store on Broadway was boarded up,” he says. 
“There were national guard troops on York Street. So that was 
a very eerie feeling.”

Unlike other universities, which closed their campuses 
and took issue with the protests, Chauncey invited the pro­
testers in. While other campuses erupted into deadly vio­
lence, Chauncey tactfully juggled the needs of protesters, 
police, students, and faculty, enabling the protests to take 
place peacefully. 

“If you look in the sixties, there was a woman named 
Rachel Carson who wrote Silent Spring––she was said to be a 
nut. Everyone said she was crazy. The gay and lesbian move­
ment was beginning and they were nuts. The antiwar people 
were nuts. It turned out that all those things they were preach­
ing were today’s gospel. I think that having society upset and 
your individual life upset is a good thing,” he says. “I’m in 
favor of revolution, quite frankly.”

Chauncey acknowledges that today’s pandemic poses 
unique challenges that the upheavals of the sixties did not. 
While May Day was a disruption caused by people, the pan­
demic is an invisible enemy. The ‘radicals’ who arrived on 
campus were driven by issues they passionately believed in, 
whereas the coronavirus has no ideology. Still, Chauncey 
hopes that Yale students and faculty will find some meaning 
in the pandemic and in society being “shaken up.”

“Every Yale student should ask him or herself––do I want 
to go back and be a Yale student just the way I was a year ago? 
Have I got some new values about things? Maybe my view of 
human life is a little different.”

As I ponder this, he tells me what he himself has learned. 
“Before the pandemic, I usually had two appointments in 
the morning. I was having lunch with somebody, I had two 
appointments in the afternoon. I might be going to a dinner at 
night with somebody in New Haven. Now, you spend more 
time by yourself and I have come to believe that I don’t want 
to go back to normal. I want a new normal.”

In the spirit of Chauncey, I am working on casting 
my gaze forward. In the two weeks we’ve been in New 
Haven so far, my friends and I have barely left our 
house. We cook dinners and sit in circles with our com­
puters and we put our faith in change. 

Nothing has the privilege of lasting forever.

New Haven’s streets feel empty but in the outlines 
surrounding their silence, I can see a loud and resound­
ing respect for this city. Yale, with its sky-high gothic 
towers, has closed and shut down, and the city has 
swelled and sighed with students coming and going. But 
New Haven remains, with a population that outnum­
bers students approximately 10:1, even when campus is 
at its fullest. There are trees that were rooted here when 
campus closed in 1918, when students left for war in 
1945, when protestors came in 1970. There are people 
who remember.

The best part of my new room is that there is a skylight 
in the ceiling. Over the course of each day, I can watch 
light flood different parts of the room. I considered put­
ting a shade on it so I could sleep better, but decided 
against it. If I stand on the right side of my room, I can 
see the Payne Whitney Gym, but if I stand on the left 
side by my bed, I just see open sky. When I feel crushed 
with claustrophobia, I look up.
