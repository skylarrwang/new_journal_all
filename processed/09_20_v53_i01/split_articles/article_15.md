U
nprecedented times. Unprecedented deaths. An unprec­
edented president. In less than a year, unprecedented 
disruption. I am fucking sick of the word unprecedented, but 
I can’t escape it. It’s on every channel, email, and news alert. 
True, sometimes the unprecedented can be wonderful and 
liberating—the train is finally off the tracks. But the unprece­
dented can also be singularly terrifying. There is no reference 
point, no first or second draft to look back on. It’s just us––
people––free-falling through 2020 and making things up as 
we go. If you sit and think too hard about it (as I have been 
doing all of June), everything seems too strange to believe. 
Like we have detached from the natural string of time.
It reminds me of a line from a story by Yalitza Ferre­
ras. This geologist, who has a lifelong obsession with 
rocks, loses part of her hand trying to touch and feel 
molten lava. In the months following the accident, she’s 
lying in bed, unable to move, and her boyfriend comes 
to comfort her: This can’t go on forever, he would say, 
as she felt the layers of forever crushing her down. 
This is often how it feels. A global disease is killing hun­
dreds of thousands of people, and all around us there is loss. 
Hospitals overflow with people who can’t breathe, workers 
lose their jobs, children can’t go to school, and everyone is 
being shepherded quickly and urgently into buildings and 
rooms, so that in the end we lose the ability to move. It feels 
like our lives have been unbuttoned one by one and flipped 
inside out. The school and city that I’ve spent the last three 
years digging fingernails and roots into is shut down, and 
we’re all staring at screens around the world trying to reach 
out to each other.
But I’m also reaching desperately for an explanation. I 
don’t understand how an event so extreme can fit into the 
narrative of my life, or even the narrative of history. I feel that 
there must be a precedent––there has to be one. This can’t 
be the first time that universities shut down, or that the world 
spun into freefall.


I
t made sense to start my search for a precedent with the 
last global pandemic. The influenza pandemic of 1918 is 
largely overlooked in U.S. history; I had never even heard of 
it until this year. Scientists initially thought the virus was just 
a common cold, until it started destroying people’s lungs, fill­
ing them with fluid and causing tissue inflammation. The 
virus infected about 500 million people, a third of the world 
population, and killed 50 million, far higher than the death 
rate of World War I. I wonder how people back then com­
prehended this degree of death and destruction. I wonder if 
they looked for precedents, too. Just like today, people in 1918 
wore masks and avoided large groups. Just like today, Yale was 
completely shut down. There’s little writing about what it was 
like in New Haven back then––it’s almost like people have 
forgotten. 
But Julia Irwin has not. In 2008, the then-doctoral 
student at Yale’s History of Science and Medicine pro­
gram wrote a deep dive historical paper about influ­
enza’s impact on the city. Irwin’s paper is a goldmine. 
She studied how the pandemic affected group relations 
in New Haven, specifically the relationships between 
the city’s largely ‘Anglo’ majority and a newer group of 
working-class Italian immigrants. Irwin is now an asso­
ciate professor of history at the University of South Flor­
ida, and she has been working from home during the 
pandemic. Through the Zoom screen, I can see that she 
has thick, layered brown hair and a warm smile.
Irwin spent the bulk of her early career researching 
pandemics. Even though today her research focuses 
on international history, her voice picks up speed and 
inflates with energy when our conversation pivots to 
public health.
“In epidemics, but also disasters more broadly, those 
sorts of moments reveal issues that are already in societ­
ies that are sometimes below the surface,” she explains. 
“Health disparities, for example, or economic dispari­
ties that are existing but people have become compla­
cent about. An epidemic can bring those to life.”
The influenza epidemic of 1918 was a prime exam­
ple, precipitating a harsh nativist stance against the Ital­
ian immigrant community. According to Irwin, Italians 
died at a rate twice as high as Anglo residents in Con­
necticut. Public health officials used this data to con­
firm the theory that Italians as a ‘race’ had succumbed 
We’ve been through this before.

more to the disease. Yet despite the fact that this prejudice 
became visible during the pandemic, Irwin found that 
Italian and Anglo residents unexpectedly suppressed the 
unrest. 
“Contrary to historiographic expectations, the New 
Haven story is one narrated by piercing silences and a dis­
tinct lack of hostility towards the immigrant community. These 
silences must be understood as a product of the period’s politi­
cal and social context,” Irwin says. 
World War I was coming to a close when the influenza pan­
demic occurred, and Americans were calling for unity and 
cooperation, Irwin explained. Anglo-Americans used the need 
for Americanism to explain why all citizens had a patriotic duty 
to follow public health guidelines. Meanwhile, Italian-Ameri­
cans acquiesced to these guidelines and started to construct a 
public image of themselves as responsible citizens. Instead of 
clashing, leaders of both Italian and Anglo groups supported a 
new end-of-war unity. The shift in New Haveners’ mentalities 
towards one another was a direct result of the time period. 
Today, the same sorts of pervasive health disparities are man­
ifesting in New Haven, but between Black and white Ameri­
cans. Due to centuries of systemic violence, Black people in 
New Haven are the racial group most likely to be hospitalized 
and to die from coronavirus, according to statistics from New 
Haven Mayor Elicker in April. However, unlike in 1918, we 
are not approaching the end of a war but rather the end of an 
openly racist president’s term. Police officers are murdering 
Black Americans in cold blood, and the Black Lives Matter 
movement has taken flight. While the influenza pandemic 
may have smoothed over community fissures in New Haven, 
the coronavirus pandemic has certainly not. 
There are few mentions of Yale in Irwin’s paper, but midway 
through she writes, “During the epidemic, Yale University, a 
centre of significant power and influence in New Haven, quar­
antined itself and ‘refused to let any of the students speak to any 
citizen unless he had a special pass.’”
Irwin details how Yale prided itself on the number of nurses 
it had to care for sick students, and celebrated the fact that just 
three Yale students died. Meanwhile, New Haven suffered from 
a severe shortage in nurses, and the New Haven Register reports 
that the total Connecticut death toll was over fifty-five hundred. 
Yale’s actions today will speak to whether or not it has learned 
from the apathy of its past. A couple months ago, President 
Salovey declined Mayor Elicker’s request to open up some of 
Yale’s empty dorm rooms for public safety officers at risk of con­
tracting coronavirus. 
Elicker criticized Yale, asking, “If your house is burning 
down and you asked a neighbor if your kids could stay at your 
house and your neighbor said ‘no,’ but here is a check so you 
could stay at the Econo Lodge across town, what would that tell 
you about your neighbor?”
The next day, Salovey announced that he would make 
three hundred beds available. But on a city budget call in 
mid-May, dozens of New Haveners demanded that Yale 
do more with its $30 billion endowment. So far during the
