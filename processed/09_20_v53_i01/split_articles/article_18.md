ach person signed the letter with their name, ID, and 
bed number. Some of the metal bunks stood empty, 
an ambiguous remembrance of a former occupant’s 
release or deportation. 

When COVID-19 swept through Massachusetts in 
March, the detainees inside the Bristol County House 
of Correction Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
(ICE) units were stuck sleeping in beds moored three 
feet apart. They were terrified. The fifty-one members 
of Unit B wrote and signed a desperate letter outlining 
their situation, followed days later by a similar plea from 
forty-seven detainees in Unit A. 

Represented by Yale Law School’s Worker and Immi­
grant Rights Advocacy Clinic and the Boston-based 
firm Lawyers for Civil Rights, the detainees filed a law­
suit against Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson 
and ICE officials on Friday, March 27, 2020. Savino 
v. Hodgson sought the release of immigrants detained 
in Bristol County to mitigate the risk of contracting 
COVID-19. The lawsuit alleged that Sheriff Hodgson 
and his staff disregarded social distancing guidelines, 
failed to provide sanitation supplies and personal pro­
tective equipment, and admitted new detainees with­
out taking proper precautions to prevent the virus from 
spreading. 

Massachusetts federal district Judge William Young 
began issuing orders to release detainees in early April, 
eventually freeing around fifty people. But those who 
were allowed to return to their communities found that 
Sheriff Hodgson continued to scrutinize their move­
ments, and people who remained incarcerated reported 
that conditions did not improve.     
	
H
odgson, who oversees Bristol County’s jails and ICE 
detention center, has positioned himself as a severe 
administrator since he was appointed sheriff in 1997. As 
a strong supporter of President Donald Trump, Hodgson 
offered to send incarcerated people to the US-Mexico bor­
der to build Trump’s long-advertised wall in 2017. A photo 
published by The Boston Globe at the time showed Hodg­
son wearing a dark suit jacket decorated with an American 
flag pin and sheriff’s badge. He posed, arms crossed, in 
front of a barbed wire fence. 

Early in his tenure, Hodgson charged detainees five 
dollars each day they were imprisoned in his facility. 
In 2010, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts ordered 
him to return the fees with interest. Undeterred, Hodg­
son testified in 2017 in support of an unsuccessful state 
bill that would have permitted 
his controversial fundraising 
scheme to continue. 
“That very well frames … 
how [Hodgson] thinks about 
incarceration 
and 
punish­
ment, but also his mind­
set when somebody has the 
temerity to challenge what he 
does,” said James Vita, a pub­
lic defender in New Bedford, 
Massachusetts 
who 
serves 
clients inside Bristol County 
House of Correction. 

After Judge Young began 
releasing detainees, Hodgson 
published a list of their crimi­
nal charges, warning in a Face­
book broadcast that “these 
people” could now be “wan­
dering” the streets. Advocates 
said that Hodgson’s purported 
public safety announcement 
was deceptive. “Even if peo­
ple may have been accused of 
crimes in the past, right now 
they are solely detained because they are non-citizens,” 
explained Oren Nimni, a staff attorney with Lawyers for 
Civil Rights.  

Beginning in June, Hodgson petitioned to revoke the 
release of detainees who left their homes in violation of 
a house arrest order. Some people had indeed tried to 
resume their lives, including going shopping or going to 
work, but lawyers found that many supposed violations 
were due to GPS errors. Moreover, Ninmi said his cli­
ents were not well-informed of the precise boundaries 
of house arrest. As a result, detainees were marked as 
non-compliant for going outside to their backyard or 
out front to check the mail. Judge Young has granted 
some of the bail revocation requests, permitting ICE to 
re-incarcerate people. 

In a 2012 article in the Massachusetts-based Herald 
News, Hodgson described himself as a “pit bull on your 
pant leg,” referring to his tenacious advocacy for inmate 
fees. Recently, he ignited public outrage for wearing a 
Confederate flag-inspired tie in a 2003 portrait for the 
Sheriff’s Office. When the photo came to light in June, 
Hodgson denied any association with neo-Confederate 
groups and defended the tie as a patriotic display of red, 
white, and blue. 

Inside Bristol County House of Correction in North 
Dartmouth, people were not in a position to denounce 
Hodgson’s ties; they were des­
perate for soap. The clean­
ing supplies provided by the 
sheriff’s office for the month 
of April ran out after a week, 
according to Ira Alkalay, an 
attorney for several current and 
former ICE detainees. Investi­
gators from the Massachusetts 
Department of Public Health 
(DPH) visited the House of 
Correction in late June and 
confirmed 
concerns 
about 
dirty bathrooms, overcrowded 
cells, and food safety problems 
in the facility’s kitchen. 

Even before the pandemic, 
DPH had reported repeated 
health code violations in Bris­
tol County, including scummy 
showers, 
dusty 
ventilation, 
and inadequate floor space in 
the ICE units. A December 
2019 review of Ash Street Jail 
in New Bedford documented 
grimy toilets, peeling paint, and doors vulnerable to bad 
weather and rodents

Bristol County Sheriff’s Office has historically denied 
or diminished complaints about conditions. 

Public Information Officer Jonathan Darling cited 
100% scores on the county’s last two inspections by the 
American Correctional Association (ACA) as evidence 
of a high standard of care. For Mario Paredes, a law­
