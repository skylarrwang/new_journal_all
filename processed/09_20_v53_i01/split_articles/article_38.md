The Still
Small Voice
of God
Observant Jews in New Haven 
distill beauty and closeness from 
socially distanced religious 
practices.

A
t 10 a.m. on the Fourth of July, Esther Nash arrived at 
the parking lot of Congregation Beth El–Keser Israel 
in the Westville neighborhood of New Haven for Shab­
bat service. For three weeks, with new COVID-19 cases 
declining throughout the state, the synagogue at Harrison 
Street had been able to hold services in-person, albeit out­
doors. 
That day, the summer sun was high in the faultless 
blue sky. Nash carried a leather-padded brown fold­
ing chair from a cart, which the synagogue staff had 
wheeled out earlier that morning, and took a seat in the 
shade of a large sugar maple tree. 
People sat dispersed across the parking lot in twos, 
threes, or fours, half their faces concealed behind masks. 
At the reader’s table, the Rabbi’s teenaged son, Noam 
Benson-Tilsen, was chanting from the Torah. As he 
chanted, letters became words, words became song, and 
the sonorous melody flowed through the listeners’ ears. 
Congregants bowed as they prayed, rocking their knees, 
the red bound book of scripture and smaller blue book 
of prayers clasped in their arms. Before the pandemic, 
the synagogue’s Rabbi, Jon-Jay Tilsen, led services in 
the synagogue’s sanctuary. His voice would reverberate 
off the laminated wood panelling and fill the high-ceil­
inged, sunlit space. But now, for the 35 people present 
to gather in the sanctuary together, breathing the same 
air, would be a health and safety risk. 
Outdoors, Benson-Tilsen’s voice was muted by the 
wind, dissipated into a low call. From twenty feet away, 
he sounded as though he was standing behind a thin 
wall. 
“God now wants us to sing quietly,” Nash said after­
ward. She was reminded of the prophet Elijah, who 
was sent fleeing South from Queen Jezebel through 
the wilderness of Judah for defending the Hebrew God 
against the prophets of Baal. Through mountain-split­
ting winds, rock-shattering earthquakes, and vicious 
fires, he did not see God. He did not hear Him. Then, 
in the silent aftermath of the blaze, he heard the “still, 
small voice” of God address him. That morning, in the 
synagogue parking lot, Nash thought now was the time 
to listen to the still, small voice of God. 
When he was finished, Noam returned the Torah 
scroll into its blue velvet cover and carried it to the holy 
ark of law, an ornamental chamber which houses the 
scroll. Before the pandemic, a procession of five or six 
people would carry the scroll counterclockwise through 
the sanctuary. The act is symbolic of “bringing the law 
to the people,” Tilsen explained. That day and during 
every outdoor Shabbat service so far, however, the task 
belonged to the Rabbi’s son alone. 
When the pandemic prompted many religious 
groups to convene online, with Zoom worship sessions 
and Friday prayer live streamed on Facebook, the same 
transition could not be applied in certain Jewish com­
munities. 
 Orthodox Jews, who adhere most strictly to Jewish 
law, refrain from using electronics during the Sabbath 
because it is prohibited by Jewish law on the day of rest, 
along with thirty-eight other activities. Some members 
of the Conservative Jewish movement, which believes 
that Jewish law, while binding, should evolve histori­
cally, also do so.

Design by Annli Nakayama 
members, including Tilsen’s own family, fall into this 
category. The reasons Tilsen offered for avoiding tech­
nology on the Sabbath are varied: it is a religious com­
mitment, a way of being a good Jew, and a personal way 
of serving God.
And so, when the synagogue closed for the first time 
in its 128-year history on March 16th to help contain 
the spread of the deadly coronavirus, Rabbi Tilsen did 
not hold Shabbat services online. “If you’re going to do 
all these things, then it removes the beauty that we cre­
ated by adhering to constraints,” he said.
In the post-pandemic world, some things can be 
moved to Zoom—calling into a wedding, practicing 
daily prayer, and singing songs together during the 
seder, or the ritual feast that marks the beginning of the 
Jewish holiday of Passover. Many others cannot—hug­
ging a loved one, holding Shabbat service in observant 
Jewish communities, and, depending on who you ask, 
forming a minyan, which is an assembly of any ten Jew­
ish adults (in the Orthodox tradition, specifically men). 
A minyan is required before certain religious rituals can 
be performed, including reading from the Torah and 
reciting important prayers like the kedusha and kaddish.
The Rabbinic definition of a minyan is unequivo­
cal that the ten adults need to be physically present in 
the same space for the group to constitute a quorum, 
explained Tilsen. “So a group that is connected only by 
being ‘on-line’ by zoom or phone does not constitute a 
quorum,” he said. That said, many reform and modern 
synagogues are holding full services, including Torah 
reading and Shabbat services, on Zoom.
Rabbi Fred Hyman, who leads the Orthodox West­
ville shul in New Haven, said, “The kedusha and kad­
dish is a very meaningful part of the service, and we still 
don’t allow it [to occur online]. We don’t just follow 
an emotional response. That’s how strict we are, and I 
think the virtual minyan is misplaced.”
In 1999, Rabbi Maurice Lamm warned presciently 
of a “crisis” in the introduction to a reprint of his 1969 
seminal textbook on deathcare, The Jewish Way in 
Death and Mourning, that would pressure Jewish peo­
ple to succumb to “commercial,” “American,” non-Jew­
ish ways. “The crisis will come, ready or not,” he wrote.
The Covid-19 pandemic appears to be one such “cri­
sis.” The story of religious Jewish communities during 
the pandemic has been one of finding beauty in con­
straint. There has been more continuity, rather than 
change, in their practice of Judaism even as stores are 
shuttered, synagogues are closed, and people are quar­
antined. 
The dozen Jewish people interviewed for this arti­
cle explained how they have adapted, resumed, and in 
some cases, coped without the rites of birth, life, and 
death that generations before them practiced accord­
ing to Jewish law. Seven of them referenced the specter 
of the Holocaust and enduring antisemitic hate in the 
United States and Europe as something that informs 
their understanding of the pandemic’s impact on the 
practice of Judaism.	


**Title: 1. Birth**
**Page number(s): 47-48**

Rachel Somerstein’s baby, Jonathan, had fallen 
asleep on the dining room table even before the brit 
milah began. His mother guessed that it was the sugar 
water-tylenol mixture that the mohel had given him, 
but newborns sleep a lot, and Jonathan was only ten 
days old. Soon, the circumcision ceremony would take 
place, welcoming him into the covenant of Abraham 
and to his family. It was the ideal situation: Emily Blake, 
his mohel, said with a laugh that her definition of a ‘per­
fect bris’ is one where the baby doesn’t cry but where 
the parents are moved to tears. 
Jonathan’s father nearly passed out as he observed the 
procedure. The mohel placed a Gomco clamp, shaped 
like a steel bell, on the baby’s penis. It would protect 
the head of the penis during the procedure and limit 
blood flow to a minimum. Blake took a scalpel and cut 
straight along the foreskin, easy and simple. It is a ritual 
of blood, one that Blake strives to make as painless as 
possible. 
Jonathan is an easygoing baby. It took him a few 
moments to cry when he was first delivered from the 
warm womb into a hospital room. Giving birth during 
a pandemic wasn’t easy, said his mother. The virus was 
ravaging her home state of New York and she worried 
that she may have to give birth alone. As Jonathan 
kicked inside her, more than 100,000 people around 
the country died from COVID-19. 	
But as soon as she found out she was having a boy, 
Somerstein knew she had to have a bris, a circumcision 
ceremony done according to Jewish law and with kava­
nah, which refers to a mindset of sincere intentionality 
that must accompany Jewish rituals. Although her hus­
band is not Jewish and has not yet converted, the cou­
ple keeps a kosher home, practices Shabbat, and says 
the Shema prayer with their daughter before she goes 
to sleep each night.
Somerstein had envisioned renting a place downtown 
in their small village of 14,000, nestled by the Shawan­
gunk Mountains in the Hudson Valley, and inviting all 
their siblings, parents, and close friends. But because of 
the pandemic, the guest list dwindled to just five: Jona­
than’s mom, dad, sister, and grandparents. 
“At one point I felt so sad about it,” she said while 
watching over her son and 4-year-old daughter. “It’s so 
sad that we couldn’t introduce our son to our families 
the way we wanted to.”
But having a brit milah was important to Somerstein. 
She wanted to give her son the freedom to decide how 
he wanted to practice Judaism when he grew older and 
this was a way to give him that agency, she said. Jewish 
men who do not have a bris done by a mohel with the 
proper blessings, in the proper time frame (not before—
and ideally on—the eighth day of life), or with the 
proper intention, must have a ritual drop of blood taken 
from their penis to make the circumcision “kosher,” as 
Blake calls it. 
The baby’s grandparents, father, older sister, and 
mother, said prayers over him. One of the blessings they 
recited was the birkat hagomel, spoken after someone 
has survived a dangerous journey—in this case, child­
birth. 
Four years earlier, Somerstein had survived a C-sec­
tion for her daughter without anaesthesia. This time, 
she had gone into prodromal labor five days days before 
Jonathan was born. She was dilating and having con­
tractions, her body was preparing for a baby that was 
coming but not ready yet. Jonathan was finally born at 
9:17pm on a Tuesday, with big cornflower blue eyes and 
pudgy legs. In early August, Jonathan was just over a 
month old, “figuring out who he is as he figures out the 
world around him,” says his mother.
During the bris, after they said the prayers, they 
gave Jonathan his Hebrew name—Yonatan. It was the 
name by which he would be called to the Torah, his 
covenantal name. On a laptop screen, Jonathan’s aunts, 
uncles, and grandparents said blessings. They each 
drank grape juice and wine, in lieu of a celebratory 
meal that could no longer be held in person.
Now that many brises have to be celebrated over 
Zoom, Emily Blake, Somerstein’s 64-year-old veteran 
mohel who has dedicated more than three decades of 
her life to this work, likes to begin the ceremony with a 
pun: they’re doing this “chai-tech” (“Chai” means life 
in hebrew).  
“We are accepting things we never thought we’d have 
to live with, in this pandemic,” said Blake on the phone 
one morning as she drove from New York to New Haven 
for a bris. “I think people are just so happy they’re get­
ting a joyous moment to celebrate, that there’s this new 
baby coming into their family. It’s a moment that you 
can step out of the incredible sadness of being stuck in 
lockdown, to have the sunshine break through that dark 
cloud.”

As a child growing up in the Jewish neighborhood of 
Borough Park in Brooklyn, New York during the 1950s 
and 60s, Esther Nash carried with her a message, forged 
by her parents’ experiences as Holocaust survivors, that 
the world is not a safe place. Her mother, Eva, had been 
plucked from her rural town in the Hasidic belt of Tran­
sylvania, Romania and deported to Auschwitz in the 
spring of 1944. She was trapped there when the camp 
was at capacity and eventually was moved to work as 
a slave laborer at a Krupps munitions plant where she 
worked on an assembly line making grenades. 
Eva would later tell her daughter about how on Yom 
Kippur, the Nazi guards in the concentration camp 
would deliberately offer more rations throughout the 
day of fasting, “to let the Jews know they no longer had a 
religion, no longer had a culture, no longer had a life,” 
said Nash. But Eva always fasted on Yom Kippur even
