“The repercussions of the disease did not stop at 
death. It absolutely affected, I think, the well-being of 
the mourner,” he said. “I do not believe to this day, and 
it’s sad, that [families] were able to at least begin their 
mourning in a meaningful way.”	

Yaron Lew has known Shure for 21 years but has 
never needed to use Shure’s funeral home until now. 
Lew does not believe in God. He doesn’t believe in the 
afterlife. His wife, Liora, believed in God. She grew up 
with a very orthodox Jewish grandfather and an observant mother who emerged from the Auschwitz death 
camp believing that her survival was due to divine intervention (her father, after surviving the Dachau concentration camp, became an atheist). Lew grew up on a 
secular kibbutz, a collective community, in Israel. 
Lew speaks with a commanding voice and laughs a 
lot, smile lines visible through his thin-framed glasses. 
Over the course of his 36-year relationship with Liora, 
he went from being a Jew who never went to synagogue 
to becoming the President of his local synagogue, 
BEKI. Lew met Liora underwater, beneath the Mediterranean shore, in an Israeli military submarine in the 
city of Haifa, where Lew was serving as a naval officer 
and where Liora had grown up.
Yaron Lew’s wife and his brother passed away within 
a week of each other in June this year. Lew was by his 
wife’s bedside when she passed, while his brother was 
in Israel. He had been sick for over two years; she had 
only been sick for two months. Neither of them passed 
from the coronavirus. He was buried according to Jewish law without a casket, so that his body may return to 
ash and dust in the earth. She was buried according to 
cemetery rules in a casket. Lew sat shiva, the seven days 
of mourning that commence upon burial, in his home, 
in person, to mourn his wife. He called his family on 
Zoom for a few hours a day as they sat shiva for his wife 
and then for his brother. 
The cemetery told him a maximum of 30 people 
could attend, so 30 people gathered at the gravesite for 
the burial. Everyone who attended had to wear a mask, 
and the funeral home tried to live stream the funeral 
for those who could not be present. But that sweltering 
day, with the temperature in the high-80s, the equipment overheated and the live stream failed. Each person donned a pair of latex gloves to pick up a shovel and 
scatter dirt onto the casket. The act is symbolic of saying 
goodbye, said Lew. 
At the shiva, Lew and his family used the outdoor 
deck and backyard of his Westville home to ensure the 
safety of the mourners. They didn’t kiss, they didn’t hug, 
they didn’t shake hands; he mourned within the constraints. Each day, more than the ten people required 
to have a minyan attended evening service so that they 
could say kaddish. They held a Zoom call for those who 
were unable or uncomfortable with travelling to Lew’s 
home for the shiva. Up to 50 people attended virtually, 
including his wife’s sister and Lew’s siblings, who live 
in Israel. 
He found himself on the opposite side of the screen 
when he sat shiva for his brother. He could not travel to 
Israel for his funeral and shiva. When I asked him how 
it felt, Lew paused for a long time and sighed. “Very 
distant. Very difficult,” he said. 	


In mid-June, when Liora was hospitalized for the 
final time, the doctors called Lew. During her previous hospitalizations, Lew and their children were not 
allowed to visit due to COVID-19 regulations. He snuck 
packages of letters and chocolates, cookies and flowers, 
in for her—“so at least she could have the smell and 
taste of home.”
“They said, ‘It’s good news and bad news. The good 
news is we are letting you and your daughters into the 
hospital, the bad news is we only let relatives of terminal 
patients go into the hospital,’” Lew recalled. She was 
moved into a hospice room a week later. “I spent the 
whole last night with her, and then she passed away in 
the morning,” he said, eyes sparkling with tears behind 
his glasses.	

I asked him what mourning means to him. “I talk 
about her a lot,” he said, smiling slightly. “I have pictures of her. I cry in the shower in the morning. I talk to 
her once in a while. I talk to friends about her. We talk 
with the girls about her, what she would think and what 
she would say. I’m not sure if that is remembering or if 
that is mourning.”

This April, two weeks before Liora was diagnosed 
with a rare and aggressive cancer, the Lew family celebrated the Passover Seder together. Instead of the usual

40 people gathered in a rented clubhouse, it was just 
Lew, Liora, and one of their daughters around the Seder 
table at home. Liora made chicken soup and butternut 
squash soup and brisket, Lew made gefilte fish (it was a 
three-day cooking event), and their friends delivered the 
sweet, sticky traditional Passover dish of haroset, homemade. The families were physically separated, but they 
were together––eating the same food, singing the same 
Passover songs, reciting the Haggadah. “Mah nishtanah, 
ha-laylah ha-zeh, mi-kol ha-leylot,” they sang. “Why is 
this night different from all the other nights?”

As a non-believer, Lew had always seen going to synagogue as a non-spiritual affair. But since the pandemic 
hit, Lew said he has started providing more spiritual 
support to the synagogue community. He writes to the 
congregation once a week. In those letters, he reminisces about returning to the kibbutz where he grew up, 
and how when he walks through the gates, he sings a 
song about how he is just a visitor in the landscape of 
his childhood. He writes about how he has felt a little like a visitor in the synagogue of late, and of how 
the pared-down Shabbat service in the parking lot was 
familiar. “It led me to reflect on the evolutionary road 
we travelled during these quarantine months,” he wrote 
in one letter. “We started to adapt and we reinvented 
ourselves.”

When Esther Nash’s father was on the frozen tundra 
in Siberia, freezing and close to death, he would pray 
to God that He should let him live. “I think he would 
have been very happy back then if he was told that he 
would live to ninety-two,” Nash told me on the phone 
on a sunny day in July. Both Eva and Shaya Rosenberg 
lived to be the same age. Until her last days in a nursing 
home, Eva always wore a gold Star of David, an engagement gift that Shaya had made by his brother-in-law.

Since the pandemic began, Nash has begun taking 
long walks through Woodbridge walking trails, and kayaking down the Housatonic River. “I think I’ve become 
more spiritual in some ways,” she said. “I’m in nature 
a lot more. I’m taking time to be in the moment a lot 
more. I’m trying to put this in perspective, thinking 
about life, and the frailty of life, and how things can 
change in a heartbeat.”
	
Rabbi Tilsen said that he’ll never know how 
different Jewish people are responding to the turmoil 
of the pandemic. Some people turn toward religion 
and God in times of crisis, others turn away. “Jewish 
theology is not doctrinal; so much theology is implicit. 
We don’t have a formal vision or idea of what God is,” 
said Tilsen. “Judaism has to do with the search for truth 
and it means rejecting ideas that are clearly falsifiable 
or clearly wrong. God often just comes from a sense of 
awe at the world.”

On the Fourth of July at noon, as Noam returned the 
Torah scroll to the ark, those present rose from their 
chairs and praised God a final time before the service 
closed. “The voice of Adonai stirs the wilderness. The 
voice of Adonai strips the forest bare…” they sang in 
Hebrew as one voice. Above them, thick foliage rustled 
and the sun stung their skin. 
In ones and twos, the faithful took their leave, stacking the chairs and tomes of scripture and prayer books 
onto the cart as they went. Nash’s low heels clicked on 
the baked tarmac as she walked away. The synagogue 
staff wheeled the trolley, heavy and laden with the Law, 
back into the cool sanctuary, where it would wait seven 
days until the next Sabbath.
