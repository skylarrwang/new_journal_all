her more sensitive to the realities of some of her clients. 

“For me, the human connection and the development 
of interpersonal relationships [is] really important,” 
she said. After discovering a passion for psychology in 
high school and “sticking to it” through a master’s and 
a doctoral degree, Silva feels she “get[s] to combine the 
personal with the professional in this work. I get to work 
with the immigrant population and, at the same time, 
address mental health-related concerns that [...] impact 
very much people’s overall wellbeing.”

The uncertainty of the pandemic only complicates 
many patients’ access to medical care. Because many 
members of the Latin American community in New 
Haven have low socioeconomic status, they often 
do not have the luxury of working from home at a 
socially distanced desk. “This is one more piece, one 
more stressor,” said Silva. “It’s clearly highlighted the 
disparities that exist in the system for ethnic minority 
communities. […] They are the essential workforce, 
having to go in and work.” 

As disclosed by DataHaven in 2019, 94 percent of 
people in the Greater New Haven area have health 
insurance. However, for communities disproportion­
ately suffering from mental health issues during the 
pandemic, having access to adequate and affordable 
mental health care can be extremely difficult. In 
2017, Milliman, a leading consulting firm specializ­
ing in insurance and health care, released a damning 
report stating that Connecticut had some of the nation’s 
worst disparities for affordable mental heath care access. 
Insurance companies denied patients’ insurance claims 
for mental health treatment at a higher rate than phys­
ical health treatment. Out-of-network patient visits are 
ten times more likely for behavioral health concerns 
than those for physical ones.

Sean Scanlon, Representative from the 98th district 
in the Connecticut General Assembly, took it upon 
himself to right this wrong. His landmark bill, the Men­
tal Health Parity Act (House Bill No. 7125), went into 
effect in January 2020. It requires insurance companies 
to treat mental and physical health claims indiscrimi­
nately and to submit an annual report for accountabil­
ity. Although it’s too early to say if it’s working, Scanlon 
said, he is optimistic because “whenever somebody is 
watching, people act differently.” According to him, 
insurance is one of the greatest reasons why people 
with mental illnesses do not get treatment—a trend that 
began in the 1960s. 

When private insurance was established after World 
War II, said Scanlon, “the standard practice [for men­
tal illness] was still, ‘Let’s institutionalize these people. 
Let’s put them in this big facility and throw away the 
key.’” After a wave of psychiatric deinstitutionalization 
in the 1960s brought about outpatient mental health 
care, insurance companies didn’t cover it. “Only the 
people who had money could afford to access that 
[care]. Everyone else was either becoming homeless, 
living in shelters, or struggling with substance use dis­
orders because they’re using drugs to cope with the fact 
that they have an untreated mental illness,” Scanlon 
said.

These patterns of stigma and neglect deeply influ­
enced Scanlon’s family and his professional life. “My

father, who is no longer alive, struggled with alco­
hol addiction in his life, and I saw that up close,” he 
explained. “I saw that folks like my dad are often the 
kind of folks we like to sweep under the rug and pretend 
don’t exist and don’t talk about.”

When Scanlon was elected in 2014, soon after the 
beginning of the third wave of the opioid epidemic, 
he focused on reform and destigmatization. “I’ve seen 
addiction and understand the damage that it causes and 
the fact that it’s a disease and not a [moral] shortcom­
ing,” he said. For Scanlon, mental health and substance 
use has always been a personal issue, “and it’s a personal 
issue to one in four people in [the U.S.].”

The pandemic provides a major stress test for Scan­
lon’s bill. The Elm City has seen over one hundred 
deaths related to the virus and almost three thousand 
more infections, but for the overwhelming majority of 
the population, the greatest impact on their lives will 
not be physical. It will be mental. “For people who have 
substance use disorder [or other mental health condi­
tions] and haven’t been able to get their treatment or 
see their provider,” argued Scanlon, “[the added] stress
