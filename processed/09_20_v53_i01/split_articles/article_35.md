aniel Pizarro was eating cereal when I met 
him, pale sunlight pouring from a window 
beside him. He sat in his East Rock home that July 
midmorning while I sat a few miles away at my own 
apartment, in front of a laptop screen. Even over 
Zoom, Pizarro’s voice was warm. He had curly, dark 
hair and a full beard.

Pizarro is a graphic designer. When the pan­
demic arrived and the shutdown began, he lost 80 
percent of his client-based jobs. Luckily, though, 
he’s found new work through his connections 
with New Haven nonprofits and grassroots organi­
zations. For the last year and a half, he said, he’s 
been trying to build a name for himself by using 
his graphic design skills to further social justice 
work in New Haven. He’s designed flyers, videos, 
posters, and graphics for Junta for Progressive 
Action, Cancel Rent CT, and City Wide Youth 
Coalition, among other groups. “Some of it’s been 
paid and some of it hasn’t,” he told me. “But that 
community has really held me through this pan­
demic.”

Across the country, artists face a fate similar 
to Pizarro’s. As of August 24, Americans for the 
Arts estimated that 94% of artists in the U.S. lost 
income due to the pandemic—an average of 
$22,200—and 63% became unemployed. The 
total income lost, they reported, was $50.6 bil­
lion. As author William Deresiewicz wrote in The 
Nation this May, “The major basis of much of 
the contemporary arts economy—live, in-person, 
face-to-face events—has been destroyed.”

This past summer, Pizzaro led a three-week 
youth program at a local arts nonprofit called 
Artspace. The program was supposed to be in-per­
son. But after the pandemic arrived, Pizarro and 
the other program coordinators reimagined the 
entire curriculum, reducing the number of stu­
dents from around twenty to only eight. They pur­
chased iPads, styluses, and animation software for 
the students. The class met on Zoom and focused 
on digital art. Miraculously, the transformation 
was a success. “They’re all making amazing art,” 
Pizarro said during the second week of the class. 
“And they pick up on it so quickly.”

The summer course—Artspace’s Summer 
Apprenticeship 
Program—explored 
graphic 
design as a tool for activism, using the art of the 
Black Panther Party from the 1960s and 70s as a 
model. The curriculum’s focus on the Panthers is 
one of a few initiatives Artspace has developed this 
year to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 
New Haven Black Panther Trials, including a gal­
lery exhibition inspired by the legacy of the Panthers 
and a podcast about the trials in New Haven. Lisa 
Dent, the Executive Director of Artspace, told me 
that these projects had been scheduled for a couple 
years—well before the pandemic, and well before 
the protests in response to the murder of George 
Floyd. But the projects suddenly became timelier 
than anyone expected. 


After the murder of George Floyd, protests swept 
the nation. According to The New York Times, 
between 15 and 26 million people had partici­
pated in the protests by July 3, making it the largest 
protest movement in U.S. history. These protests 
pushed the long-standing injustices of systemic rac­
ism and anti-Blackness into mainstream attention 
and prompted many people to work toward change 
within their disciplines. For those in the art world 
committed to broad political change, the questions 
are, in Dent’s words, “How do artists engage in 
social justice? How can artists support that work or 
be supported during that work?” 

According to Pizarro, the students in Artspace’s 
Summer Apprenticeship Program discussed how 
lessons from the Panthers can be applied to the 
contemporary Black Lives Matter movement. 
“We’re not telling them what 
to do, but we’re allowing 
them the space for self-ex­
pression, and to contribute 
to this idea that artists in 
this moment do have a role 
to play.”

“Some of the main messaging that [the Panthers] 
talked about, like police brutality, is directly par­
alleled with the BLM movement in this moment,” 
Pizarro said. 

But what exactly, is the connection between art 
and activism? What can art do that, say, protest and 
community organizing cannot? Pizarro emphasized 
that art is profoundly personal and expressive and 
that it can help individuals find their voices within 
a movement. “The students are trying to figure their 
place out, and they’re creating work that directly 
speaks to that,” Pizarro said. “We’re not telling them 
what to do, but we’re allowing them the space for 
self-expression, and to contribute to this idea that 
artists in this moment do have a role to play.”

It’s one thing to say that artists have a role to 
play in this moment. It’s another to clarify those 
terms. What role, and which moment? How exactly 
should art engage with a protest movement—not to 
mention a pandemic? 

T
he category of art, and even of contemporary 
visual art, is vast—perhaps too vast to generalize 
usefully about what role it should play right now. Dif­
ferent kinds of art will inevitably engage with social 
justice in different ways. 

Althea Rao, for example, decided to put her proj­
ect Vagina Chorus on hold during the pandemic. 
Until the end of July, Rao was an Artist-in-Residence 
at Artspace, which means she had around-the-clock 
access to studio space owned by the nonprofit. 
Vagina Chorus, one of the projects Rao was devel­
oping in that studio, involves a group of perform­
ers using a “vaginal insertive pelvic floor trainer” 
combined with a “Bluetooth enabled bio feedback 
algorithm” to “sonify the internal movements, pro­
ducing immersive light effects and a symphony of 
sound waves, forming a chorus,” according to Rao’s 
website. In other words, the performers create a 
music and light show by squeezing their pelvic floor 
(an exercise called a kegel). 

The project is designed to address urinary incon­
tinence, which, as Rao told me, “is closely tied 
to childbirth, menopause, all of these physical 
events that a person who has a uterus might have 
over their entire lifespan.” The major symptom of 
urinary incontinence is leaky urine. Rao said that 
while urinary incontinence has been stigmatized 
and ignored for too long, it was understandably 
overshadowed by the pandemic. “It’s just a matter 
of urgency,” Rao said. “If someone is worried about, 
‘Okay, I don’t even know where I’m going to live 
tomorrow, I cannot physically socially distance, 
and I might die if I get [Covid-19],’ and then you’re 
talking to them about, ‘What about your leaking 
problem?’ they probably won’t want to talk about 
that. It’s not as important.” 

How should Rao’s project engage with the cur­
rent moment? The question sounds misplaced.  If 
your art is about urinary incontinence, then it’s 
about urinary incontinence — not the pandemic, 
and not necessarily the BLM movement. 

Though the pandemic has halted performances 
of Vagina Chorus for a while, it’s also provided
