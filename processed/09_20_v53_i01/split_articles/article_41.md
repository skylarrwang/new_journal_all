**Title: DISPATCH FROM THE BOOK TRADER CAFE WRITER-IN-RESIDENCE**

At the beginning of shutdown, in early March, 
I used to venture out for long walks, bundled in 
my purple coat. The city was quiet and cold, my fingers losing feeling within fifteen minutes. In such 
weather, I longed for a cup of coffee to smooth over 
the day’s rough edges—my coffee shops of choice are 
Willoughby’s and the Book Trader Cafe.  I like to joke 
that I was the Book Trader writer-in-residence: until 
this past March I had finished every final paper underneath their hazy glass ceiling. But after spring break, 
Book Trader closed its doors. The rickety brown tables 
were upturned and placed on the counter. Willoughby’s window soon sported a hopeful sign, saying they 
would open someday soon. Both Blue State cafes 
featured a sign saying they were closed indefinitely. 
Koffee? looked abandoned, frozen in the days when 
we might brave the cold for a cigarette smoke. When 
Duda spoke about his employees, I thought briefly of 
the nice barista who used to joke with me about milk 
alternatives at the Book Trader counter. These people, like the Yale employees who brighten our day, are 
as much part of our college experience as the individuals we learn alongside.  

Some of the first coffee shops to return this summer were Koffee? and Willoughby’s Grove Street 
location, which both opened in July. Atticus, too, 
opened up its doors in late July, though the bookstore section is now separated by a pane of glass, and 
the seating area is blocked by shelves of sourdough 
and local craft beer. Blue State opened their York 
Street cafe on June 17th. Since students started 
arriving in New Haven, I’ve seen more people 
sitting inside, their masks off. There’s something 
strange about peering into the York Street Blue 
State. It’s a familiar sight, students with laptops 
open and black coffees in hand, but it looks off, foreign, a kind of looking-glass into the campus world 
we knew before. Absorbing the image of barefaced 
students indoors, it takes me a few moments to 
remember we’re in a pandemic, and then my mind 
reaches for anxiety: how can people be allowed to 
sit inside with their masks off? 

While Blue State on York may be stuck in a not-
so-distant past, other coffee shops have altered their 
expectations. Koffee’s Goodall says that “one thing 
that has really become clear in this pandemic is: innovate or die.” For Goodall, this has meant working with nearby buildings to secure outdoor space 
that fits tables that are at least six feet apart. For Willoughby’s, it meant closing down their York Street
