Sitting on my parents’ orange couch while scrolling 
through Librex one afternoon, I came upon a post 
entitled “African-American and Ethnicity studies are 
bullshit.” Tapping on this title, I opened the post, which 
described how these fields of study are “designed to lure 
unsuspecting poc…. by majoring in these, students gain 
no practical skills” and become trapped in “the cycle of 
poverty.”

The post had garnered a significant number of 
upvotes that day, so Librex—an anonymous discussion forum exclusively for Ivy League students à la 
Reddit or YikYak—brought it to the top of my feed. 
Responses ranged from firm endorsements—“This is 
a take I can firmly agree with.”—to dismissive opposition—“Nah you can find a great job no matter what 
you major in.”

The mission of Librex (“‘Libr’ for libre [as in free], 
‘ex’ for exchange”) is to “democratize college discourse and create a space for honest open discussion 
about what’s going on in your campus community,” 
per the app’s website. Ryan Schiller ’21, the founder 
of Librex and currently the only full-time employee, 
released his product on iOS in September 2019. 
Today, the app boasts around 11,000 registered users, 
3,200 of which are active daily, spending over an 
hour on average perusing posts and messaging others 
(though I recently came upon a post confessing a five-
hour Librex binge).  An Ivy League .edu email address is 
required to log on to the platform, and once inside, the 
user is greeted by an infinite scroll of posts.

In an effort to understand the motives behind controversial content on the platform, I matched with the 
student who wrote the post. On the app, users can send 
private messages to the author of a specific post or comment.

Only identified by the Librex UI’s pill-shaped badges 
for each school, the Harvard student explained, “So my 
post is what we call ‘bait’ here on Librex. It’s definitely 
not my true thoughts. I’m just happy a lot of people 
have taken the bait. Although, I’m shocked some people support this.” Eager to incite a reaction, stir up the 
comments section, and amass attention, people bait all 
across the internet—this isn’t by any stretch a feature or 
quirk of Librex. But I was shocked by how shamelessly 
this person owned up to it.

“So you don’t actually believe any of this stuff?” I 
asked to clarify.
   “No I think it’s dumb. I’m black and double major 
in African American studies. Just thought it’d be interesting to see what people thought. I also don’t argue 
with the comments. I’m more interested in seeing how 
it plays out.” Reticent to disclose even their name’s first 
initial for fear of being identified, the user vanished 
back into the app’s anonymous mist after just a few more

questions.

Taking this Harvard student at their word, the post 
would fall in the category of well-intentioned baiting. 
But they just as easily could have lied to me, aiming to 
be a hurtful troll the whole time. In the end, does the 
intention even matter when everything is anonymous?

On any given day, Librexers—this is what they call 
themselves—discuss politics (“Renaming the past”), 
imposter syndrome (“How is everyone so put together 
and so far ahead already???”), and sex (“I’ve never had an 
orgasm”). They express their worries (“My dad is in the 
operating room rn”) and ask critically important logistical questions (“Is toads closed forever?”), but between 
the banal is a world that much more closely resembles 
the digital fringes. Schiller acknowledges that “any time 
there is anonymous discourse among thousands of people, there will be users who don’t contribute positively 
to the discussion.” But how does Librex decide what 
stays and what goes? What is useful, what is hurtful, 
what is truthful? And who makes the decisions?

***

In a February 2020 interview with the Yale Herald, 
Schiller explained that he felt “isolated and alienated” 
after his sophomore year, often wondering if others 
would judge him for ideas brought up in class. He 
wanted to give students a space where they could air 
sensitive thoughts without the fear of being called out. 
Today, Schiller seems much more comfortable 
expressing his views on controversial topics. Casually, 
he revealed to me his belief in the state of Israel (“I’m 
a big religious Jew. I’m also a big Zionist”), which he 
surely knows could be an unpopular stance on Yale’s 
left-leaning campus.

But for those who can’t sit so openly and confidently 
with their ideas, Schiller brought forth a solution. A 
Math and Global Affairs double major without any 
coding skills, he googled his way through every question over the summer of 2019—“how do you make an 
iOS app,” “how do you get it on the Apple Store”—and 
ended up with a basic framework for the application. 
Along the way, he temporarily sought others to help 
him with development, outreach, and design.

The app’s user base stayed small for a while, with 
around 100 daily active users in February 2020, but 
steadily grew as Schiller expanded piece by piece to the 
rest of the Ivy League—from Yale he moved to Dartmouth, then came the rest.

As COVID-19 hit, kicking students off campus 
and sending them home, Librex blew up. The platform teemed with discussion about how schools would 
respond to the virus, when or even if students could go 
back to campus, and what Zoom classes would look like. 
A contentious point of debate on Librex at this time was 
about whether or not Yale should enact a universal pass 
(UP) policy to accommodate the immense range of 
learning environments at home. Over the phone, Schiller praised the platform for providing a place for “people 
[who] didn’t feel like they could speak on their opinions 
[on UP]” publicly. But this open debate, though occasionally productive, also included derisive digs. After 
Yale converted all classes to pass/fail, a post appeared on 
Librex and subsequently made the rounds on Facebook 
and Twitter that simply read “congrats poor people.”

In late May the Twitter account @LibrecksApp 
emerged. The account owner reposts screenshots of 
offensive posts on the platform, mocking Librex’s generous content moderation and circulating especially 
offensive or off-color posts. At the same time, content 
moderation entered the national discourse when, on 
May 26th, Twitter fact-checked the President for the 
first time by placing a label below his erroneous claims 
that mail-in ballots lead to voter fraud. In the following 
weeks, Twitter continued to place warnings on the President’s tweets, attaching a notice of violation of Twitter’s 
content policy for “glorifying violence” over his incendiary re-invocation of the phrase “when the looting starts 
the shooting starts.” The question arose, where does a 
social media platform end and a publication begin?

It’s a debate that may never be resolved. Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook), Jack Dorsey (Twitter), Susan Wojcicki (YouTube), and Steve Huffman (Reddit) are constantly weighing decisions on this question, and some 
have taken more drastic steps than others. In late June, 
Huffman banned over 2,000 subreddits including the 
massive Trump-focused thread “The_Donald” in accordance with a new content policy of no hate on Reddit, 
whereas Zuckerberg has favored inaction, stating that 
Facebook won’t be “arbiters of truth.”  Many Librexers expressed frustration to me about large social media 
companies. One anonymous user told me, “I used to 
love Reddit, but then they caved to the mob” and have 
now moved to Librex for its anonymity and looser moderation policies.


Librex is moderated according to three simple rules:
“Be legal: No spam, threats, or darknet type stuff;” 
“Be a mensch: No targeting individual students or professors (excluding public figures);”  and “Be specific: 
No sweeping statements about core identity groups.” 
If a post breaks the rules, it’s removed. Repeat offenses 
or an especially egregious transgression: the user is 
banned. In theory, it’s a simple rubric.

But stark lines quickly become blurry, black and 
white turning to a mute grey—a post rarely fits neatly
