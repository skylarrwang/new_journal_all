EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
alone in struggling with visa issues—the lives of 
Chinese students in the U.S. have been upended 
by recent China-specific policies that endanger 
student visa procurement and renewal. And 
with the cancelation of intercultural programs 
like the Peace Corps and Fulbright in China, 
American students hoping to strengthen their 
understanding of China and forge transnational 
connections are being denied the opportunities 
to do so. All of these are signifiers of an ominous 
trend—what experts are calling a complete 
decoupling of the U.S. and China, and perhaps 
even a new Cold War.


The stakes of visa approval are especially 
heightened for Chinese citizen and Yale Law 
School student Yao Lin. Yao is 36, bespectacled 
and effortlessly eloquent, a Chinese national 
from the coastal province of Fujian. He speaks 
to me from his study in New Haven, a teal, light-
soaked room lined with shelves of books stacked 
like Jenga blocks, occasionally pausing to soothe 
the fussy 2-year-old on his lap. He says he cannot 
return to China anytime soon, as he fears the 
fall-out from his history of political activism.


For years, Yao advocated in China for feminism, 
LGBTQIA+ rights, and migrant workers 
without facing much backlash from the government. 
Then came his criticisms of President Xi 
Jinping’s policies. He wrote his critiques publicly 
on WeChat, Weibo, and Douban, and even 
authored an op-ed for a Hong Kong-based website. 
In 2017, he denounced the government’s 
eviction of millions of migrant workers from Beijing, 
and a year later, the removal of term limits 
to Xi’s presidency.


In 2018, he was invited by Peking University 
to teach a summer course on political philosophy. 
But a few days before the course was scheduled to 
begin, the department told him he was 
no longer allowed to teach the class, per a verbal 
order from the Ministry of Education. A substitute 
teacher replaced him. Yao knew then that 
his teaching career in China was over.


Under President Xi’s administration, academics 
who have spoken out against the government 
have faced severe consequences. Xu Zhangrun 
and Zhang Xuezhong, professors and vocal critics 
of the Chinese government, are prominent 
examples of this trend. Xu and Zhang believe 
they were fired by their respective universities, 
and since had their teaching privileges suspended 
because of their criticism of one-party 
rule, the removal of term limits to the Chinese 
presidency, and the government’s Covid-19 
response. In the last few months, they were both 
detained by Chinese authorities for unclear reasons, 
but have since been released.


For fear of similar treatment, Yao decided to 
leave China. At that point, he had already been 
admitted to Yale Law School, so he decided to 
join his wife Yuan in New Haven. Yuan had 
already been studying at Yale for five years, pursuing 
a doctorate in philosophy and caring for 
their young children. In 2018, Yao reunited with 
his family. As he and his wife progressed through 
graduate school, they planned for careers in 
American academia.


In May, they learned that the Trump administration 
was considering suspending the 12-month 
work authorization program Optional Practical 
Training (OPT). Yuan, who was slated to graduate 
from Yale that month, had applied for an OPT and 
needed its approval to not only begin her position at 
a university in Virginia the following semester—but 
also to remain in the country.


They worried for several months, fearing the visa 
approval would never come. On July 7, finally, Yuan’s 
OPT application was approved. “If the approval 
didn’t come by the end of July, she would have lost 
her job,” Yao said.


That means, for now, they get to stay. Yuan will 
be an Assistant Professor at Virginia Commonwealth 
University this semester, teaching philosophy 
courses remotely. Yao will complete his final year of 
law school, and apply for an OPT himself this time 
next year. The U.S. has become their home. Their 
children, a girl and a boy, both born in America, 
know no other country as well as this one. But as a 
family, they continue to hold their breath.


“These small things have a day-to-day psychological 
effect on us,” Yao said. “Even if all of these difficulties 
can be resolved, we live in constant anxiety, 
fear and worry.”


As students in STEM, Yale School of Medicine post-
doctoral student Zhao* and third-year graduate 
student Xu* are among the cohort of Chinese students 
who are especially scrutinized by the U.S. government. 
Over the past few months, the Trump administration 
has made significant political moves that indicate a 
growing suspicion of Chinese students, especially 
those studying STEM. In May, President Trump 
issued a presidential proclamation banning Chinese 
graduate students and researchers suspected of ties to 
the Chinese military from entering the country on a 
F- or J-visa. In June, Senators Tom Cotton and Marsha 
Blackburn introduced the SECURE CAMPUS Act to 
Congress. The bill would effectively bar Chinese students 
from receiving visas to the U.S. for graduate or 
postgraduate studies in STEM fields.


Senators Cotton and Blackburn have increasingly 
accused China of intellectual property theft and 
espionage. After the contents of the SECURE CAMPUS 
Act were released in May, Senator Blackburn 
tweeted: “Beijing exploits student and research visas 
to steal science, technology, engineering and manufacturing 
secrets from U.S. academic and research 
institutions. We’ve fed China’s innovation drought 
with American ingenuity and taxpayer dollars for too 
long; it’s time to secure the U.S. research enterprise 
against the CCP’s economic espionage.”


The Trump administration has also cracked 
down on graduate students, researchers, and professors 
with possible ties to China to prevent espionage and 
intellectual property theft. In January, the 
Department of Justice (DOJ) charged the chair of 
the department of chemistry and chemical biology 
at Harvard with one count of making a false statement, 
accusing him of concealing his connection to 
Wuhan University of Technology and China’s Thousand 
Talents Plan. DOJ also charged a Boston University 
robotics researcher who hadn’t disclosed her 
involvement with the Chinese army, and a Chinese 
cancer researcher with stealing and trying to smuggle 
21 vials of cells from a Boston medical center.


Zhao and Xu understand that their identities as 
Chinese graduate students in STEM might complicate 
their visa renewal processes.


Zhao hasn’t been home in the past two years, ever 
since he first left northeastern China for America. 
This year, he’d planned on finally returning home—
his sister is getting married—but the pandemic, coupled 
with the current political climate, has changed 
his mind.


His J-1 visa expired in April of last year, and going 
home would mean having to get it renewed in order 
to re-enter the U.S. He feared the visa renewal process 
would be prolonged by his being a Chinese 
STEM student—the exact demographic Senator 


Cotton and his political allies are trying to exclude 
from the country—and couldn’t take the risk of being 
stranded in China indefinitely. “I am still working on 
my [research] project. I need to take care of my lab 
mice,” he said. “If I go back to China for one or two 
months and then can’t come back because of visa 
problems, it will be terrible for me.”


Due to similar fears, Xu, who is from inner Mongolia, 
hasn’t gone home recently either. Her F-1 visa 
expired last year.


“Science graduate students [from China] have 
always had a hard time applying for visas,” said Xu. 
“But now, the situation is getting worse. I’ve heard 
of [postdoctoral students] being sent back to China 
even though their research is not at all military-related. 
They worked in biology, like me, and I have 
no clue why they were in that situation. My friends 
and I are really worried that our research or our lives 
will be affected by these new, unpredictable policies.”


Zhao is perplexed by the political rhetoric villainizing 
Chinese STEM students like him. “Scientists 
have nationalities, but science itself doesn’t have 
nationalities,” he said. “For me, I come from China, 
but with the science I am doing now, it’s beyond 
countries.” He paused for a moment. “That’s how we 
think of it in the scientific community, anyway.”


Buried in President Trump’s July 14 executive order 
addressing Beijing’s installation of a National Security 
Law in Hong Kong is a provision ending the Fulbright 
exchange programs in Hong Kong and China. 
The programs’ cancelation came six months after the 
Peace Corps withdrew from China without so much as 
a press release.


Founded in 1946 by Senator J. William Fulbright, the 
Fulbright Program is an international 
educational program created for the “promotion of 
international good will.” Fulbright has operated in 
China since the days of the Nationalist Government, 
prior to the establishment of the People’s Republic 
of China in 1949. Over the past 40 years, more than 
3,000 scholars from the U.S. and China have participated 
in the U.S.-China Fulbright Programs.


Grace Jin ’20 was supposed to leave for Hangzhou in 
March 2021. She’d spent a year applying 
for the Fulbright Program in China, and learned of 
her acceptance this April. As a Global Affairs major 
who’d been on the pre-med track, she’d wanted to 
do public health field work before starting medical 
school. “I wanted to apply all of the research skills I 
had learned at Yale to a project in a community that 
I was a part of,” said Jin. Her project on population 
aging and community-based care for elderly populations 
was to be conducted in Hangzhou, the capital 
city of the province she’d called home from first to 
fifth grade. She saw it as her chance to engage with 
the community near her grandparents’ hometown.


In mid-July, Jin learned of Fulbright China’s cancelation 
reading the news on the President’s July 14 
executive order. But she wasn’t certain of the program’s 
termination until an official email from the 
Fulbright Commission confirmed her suspicions. 
The email cited the President’s executive order and 
provided no further explanation.


Although she was disappointed, Jin wasn’t surprised 
by the news. She believes both governments 
are heading toward a complete decoupling and 
rejection of diplomacy. “There are a lot of ideological 
conflicts [between the two countries] to be dealt 
with seriously, but ending a program like Fulbright, 
which is necessary for understanding, is counterproductive.”
