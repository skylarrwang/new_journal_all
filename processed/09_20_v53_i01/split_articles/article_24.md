It was snowing as I walked down High Street one 
February evening, furious. Why had I left Jonathan 
Edwards College so fast? Why had I known, in a split 
second, that I could no longer stand to be in that room? 
I had just told John, my now-ex boyfriend, that I felt 
uncomfortable in my encounters with his friend Mark, 
another man. Mark and I knew each other from class 
freshman year. We never hung out one-on-one, but 
during group hangouts after dinner, or when I sat next 
to him during a meal, Mark would only address ideas 
about philosophy and theory to the man I was with. 
He’d nod, if anything, in my direction, while angling 
his body towards the other man. If I attempted to join 
the conversation, he’d pretend that he didn’t hear what 
I said. The only time Mark showed personal interest in 
me was when he learned I was single. Immediately, he 
asked me to dinner and spent the entire night talking 
about sex—staring deep into my eyes, he talked about 
the wonder of sexual harmony, clearly trying to get me 
to sleep with him. As soon as I started dating someone, 
Mark resumed ignoring me, apart from the occasional 
appraising once-over of my body. I was no longer avail­
able for sex, and therefore no longer of interest to him. 
Immediately after I relayed my experiences to John, 
he turned to our friend Alex, the other man in the 
room. “But I’ve never seen Mark do anything sexist,” 
John said. “Do you think he’s sexist?” This question, 
addressed to Alex, not me, was startling. Something felt 
off—I was talking about my experience with Mark, not 
John’s, and not Alex’s. 

I left that room in JE before I even knew I was leav­
ing, before I recognized that the icy feeling driving me 
to my feet was fury. As I crossed Elm Street and strode 
through Cross Campus, my thoughts began to crystal­
lize. John had asked another male to validate my dis­
comfort. There were several problems with this: first, 
that John doubted my feelings in the first place, and 
second, that he had needed confirmation from another 
male to confirm that my intuition—my sense, as a 
woman, that I was encountering sexism—was ‘correct.’ 
I don’t believe that men should be excluded from dis­
cussions of sexism—far from it. But neither John nor 
Alex had any right to decide whether my feelings were 
valid.

Nowadays, I know when I’m in danger, and I know 
when I have to leave. I know when I’m safe, and when 
I can let my guard down. But I wasn’t always confident 
in my judgement. First, I had to identify their source. 
These feelings of intuition arise not from my brain but 
from my gut. 

So what is intuition, really? For me, it precedes ratio­
nality. It manifests before I read a situation analytically. 
It’s a feeling, but not an emotion. I cannot remember 
life without it, but it only started to feel important in 
adolescence, when I began to think more critically 
about my gender in relationship to others. At around 
sixteen, I was no longer able to leave my sense of female 
identity, and the particular intuition that came with it, 
at the door. When I entered a space with other people, 
I began to notice how they reacted to my performance 
of gender. Some guys looked over my whole body. I 
began to learn, based on their glance, whether to avoid 
or approach them. Over the years, this intuition has 
intertwined itself with my relationships with men in 
all the spaces I inhabit: the street, the library, parties,
