know and the people that I struggle with and don’t like 
and don’t know.” 
Ochumare sees organizing as a way of recreating the 
spaces of care that she remembers growing up around. 
When Ochumare was young she “saw black moms, 
women coming together, due to social economic rea­
sons. We’d all go over to one another’s houses, the cous­
ins, all the family’s kids, the extended family’s kids, and 
we all thought we were just having fun.” Ochumare 
began to laugh. “But in the kitchen these black women 
were coming together to do what we now call mutual 
aid—one person brought the chicken, another brought 
the rice, another brought the vegetables and they made 
it work. They fed their kids and everyone had leftovers 
for the next day.” 
Her organizing language was not learned from just 
growing up black ––it came from great personal sacri­
fice and a willingness to learn. When Trayvon Martin 
was killed in the summer of 2012, she saw the toll that 
type of injustice took on her young son, who announced 
to her that he no longer wanted to be a police officer. 
When she started the New Haven chapter she recalled, 
“I didn’t wanna keep showing up hurt and harmed and 
further perpetuating that hurt and harm on other black, 
brown, queer, differently-abled, and poor folk.” 
She began with CEIO, a year-long educational pro­
gram on the history of community organizing. She cred­
its her learning to not only this program but also to the 
organizers she met in the classroom. An avid reader, 
Ochumare sourced a massive list of book recommen­
dations from organizers like Kerry Ellington, who works 
with People Against Police Brutality, Norman Clemente 
and Chris Garaffa, from Connecticut Bail Fund, Rhonda 
Caldwell and Justin Farmer who hold public office, and 
others from around the state that would be important 
relationships for her years of organizing to come. Eight 
years later and Ochumare is still attending educational 
programs and has created her own anti-rascist workshops.
Something that motivated Ochumare to dedicate so 
much time to education was encountering the import­
ant distinction between “activist” and “organizer”. 
When we spoke, Ochumare identified with mother­
hood, magic, healing, and queerness just as much as 
she did the title of “organizer,” explaining that “activism 
and organizing are two different lived experiences that 
are dependent on each other.” She described activism 
as the first step, like attending a protest, calling a local 
representative, or writing about an issue; all of this is 
being, in some sense, activated. 
 “Organizing is the next step past activation, it’s gal­
vanization—the sharing of education, creating small 
spaces, sharing language, recreating language, doing 
the one on ones, the phone calls, the interviews, et cet­
era,” Ochumare continued. She noted that this distinc­
tion does not separate the activist and the organizer, but 
instead calls attention to the sacrifice organizers make 
in the fight for social justice. They not only organize 
others; they educate themselves, and they are constantly 
at work in the background of every movement.


A
s students, the role of organizing comes with its own 
set of difficulties. As Zoe Hopson, an organizer and 
junior at Yale, explained: “You need to plan out every sin­
gle detail of a protest, even if you have an exam the next 
day. If we can’t figure out how to get people to x, y, or z, 
there’s not gonna be a presence or a protest. Organizing 
would be a lot easier if we knew why Yale was saying no; 
it’s really frustrating to be doing all this work, and [there’s 
the] potential for Yale to ignore it and just be waiting us 
out.” 
Some people view Yale as a closed ecosystem, say­
ing that the University rarely has to answer to the New 
Haven community despite its position as the largest 
land-owner and employer in New Haven and the owner 
of the Yale Police Department, which has jurisdiction 
over the entire New Haven area. “If Yale is gonna have 
such a huge presence in New Haven and such an intru­
sive presence, the community needs to have more of 
a say in what’s going on and have more access to the 
resources and things that we students have,” Hopson 
said.
This relationship between Yale and New Haven fur­
ther complicates the role of activism at the University. 
“I think Yale students were really good at forcing help 
on New Haven and not asking what they needed.” said 
Hopson. “Disarmament was something that was voiced 
by New Haven. We are using our privilege and our

resources to get that need met. This is an organization 
where we get all our energy, all of our ideas, all our 
collaboration, all of our power from the New Haven 
community and we do what they want.”  She added that 
when planning actions like their recent online teach-
ins, or the protests in June, BSDY reached out to orga­
nizers to plan and collaborate. 
For BSDY board member and Yale junior Isaac 
Yearwood, there is a clear reason why these organizers 
should be centered in the conversation: “We are here 
for four years... there are people who have been here 
before us and will be here after us, so the number one 
thing we can do is listen to them and support them and 
do everything in accordance with what’s best for them.” 
As BSDY heads into the new school year, Hopson 
says the organization is looking to collaborate with other 
college campuses in Connecticut and national organi­
zations to form coalitions. It is also working to finalize 
multiple written reports, including a proposal to the Yale 
administration explaining how their new demands could 
be implemented. Jaelen King ’22, another board mem­
ber, is excited to take to the streets with New Haven now 
that school has resumed. “With COVID-19, of course 
our first priority is keeping people safe, so we really have 
to get creative. But the goal is to keep pushing and pro­
viding pressure.”
Hopson, Yearwood, and King have all been involved in 
BSDY since its founding last April and as rising juniors, 
have taken on leadership roles. Over the past year, they 
have learned from New Haven community leaders and 
grown as organizers themselves. King, who serves as the 
executive director, centered the idea of person-to-person 
connection. 
“Sometimes principles and ideas get lost, but at the 
end of the day we are fighting for this individual per­
son to be able to live and be happy,” he said. King also 
said that he has learned how women of color and queer/
trans folk of color have led the movement both nation­
ally and in New Haven. “It’s really powerful to watch 
black women especially be centered and the leaders of 
this movement,” Hopson added. “I want to mirror that on 
campus—where black women’s voices are being heard 
and listened to and respected.”
 “New Haven organizers have taught me how to love 
and how to love unconditionally in the face of absolute 
rejection,” Yearwood said. The action chair of BSDY, 
Yearwood has taken what he has learned from organiz­
ers and combined it with his experience in Yale’s Edu­
cational Studies program, organizing online teach-ins 
open to Yale students, New Haven residents, and any­

one following BSDY on social media.
He said of these events: “The most beautiful part is 
seeing the passion people put into research—you see 
people owning this information making it personal, 
making it their own so when they give it to someone 
else they can do that as well.” As conversations around 
police abolition and defunding enter mainstream con­
versation, he sees education becoming an increasingly 
important part of BSDY and the Black Lives Matter 
movement as a whole. 
Callie Benson-Williams ’23, the finance director 
of BSDY, is excited for what’s to come. “I feel like 2 
months ago no one would have thought defunding 
the police was a realistic idea at all,” she said. “Police 
abolition is something I learned from the New Haven 
activists we worked with. Even before the recent push 
for that, New Haven activists were talking about police 
abolition, prison abolition.”
Y
et as much as the BSDY is looking towards the future, 
its founding as an organization is inextricably tied to 
recognizing the work of organizers that came before, spe­
cifically the work of black women and black queer folk, 
both at Yale and in New Haven. 
After the shooting of Stephanie Washington and Paul 
Witherspoon, Kerry Ellington came to the Afro-Ameri­
can Cultural Center and recounted her own long fight 
against an unjust act of violence over two years prior. 
In 2017, fifteen-year old Jayson Negron was shot four 
times at point blank range by Bridgeport Police officer 
James Boulay. Despite a year of intense organizing and 
fighting by Kerry Ellington and the Connecticut orga­
nization People Against Police Brutality, the Bridgeport 
police cleared the officer of all charges. Ellington con­
nected the feelings of outrage BSDY had to the shoot­
ing of Stephanie and Paul with her lived experience as 
an organizer.
On the student level, BSDY benefited from the expe­
rience of student organizers involved in NextYale back 
in 2015, an organization of primarily black and POC 
women of Yale who organized in response to the actions 
of what some POC on campus called the “Racepoca­
lypse.” In 2019, NextYale organizers Nia Berrain ’19, 
Erika Lopez ’19, Maya Jenkins ‘19 and alum Eli Cebal­
lo-Countryman ‘18 led BSDY’s initial conversations in 
the Afro-American Cultural Center. “This is how I’ve 
seen the class of 2018, 2017, 2015 do things, and I know 
exactly the language they used to get people together,” 
Berrain recalled.
 At the time that BSDY started, the Yale semester 
was also at its typically chaotic end. “I don’t remem­
ber studying for finals because most of my nights were 
spent in the house organizing; every other day there 
was another thing to do,” Hopson said. In April of 2019, 
BSDY collected and delivered over 1,000 complaints 
to YPD, marched with Kerry Ellington and other com­
munity activists, and joined Hamden and New Haven 
residents in demanding accountability from their own 
police departments and cities. “In the midst of turmoil, 
pain, and suffering and a lot of people going through 
things emotionally, mentally, and physically, we used 
those emotions as a rallying cry,” Yearwood recalled. 
Days before the term ended, an assistant to Presi­
dent Salovey emailed BSDY and invited them to meet 
with the President’s Taskforce on Diversity, Equity, and 
Inclusion. “That’s not who we were trying to speak out 
to,” King recalled in response. “We weren’t just trying to
