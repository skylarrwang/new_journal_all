Art is political “in the sense 
that it’s a kind of occasion… 
the occasion for a whole 
complex of social relations.”
Nontsikelelo Mutiti, a graphic designer and a friend 
of Pizarro’s, also visited. One day during the program, 
Pizarro assigned the students a documentary about 
the Black Panther Party to watch for homework. The 
next day, as a surprise, Pizarro announced to the stu­
dents that Ericka Huggins would be visiting class that 
day. “They were starstruck,” Pizarro said. The stu­
dents got to meet a real-life, former leader of the New 
Haven Black Panther Party, just after learning about 
the Panthers’ historical significance. Huggins spoke 
to the students about Black female leadership and 
the importance of “taking time to heal” during the 
labor-intensive work of activism.


Some days, the students worked on self-por­
traits. Others, they practiced digital typography, or 
creative writing. They even did theater exercises 
together, all without ever meeting in person. 
“With any environment where you meet new 
people, you’re sort of shy in the beginning,” Pizarro 
told me. “But I think that is particularly true with 
how young people behave in a digital space.” His 
students, at first, didn’t want to show themselves on 
camera. “We’re sharing our intimate spaces, like 
our room. Some people might be a little shy about 
that.” But over the three weeks, Pizarro said, the 
students blossomed. He encouraged them to have 
breakout sessions so they could get to know one 
another without his help. The theater exercises, 
especially, helped Pizarro and his students break 
past their discomfort. They forgot their lines, they 
did silly improv skits, they laughed together. “It 
was really a joyful experience that I didn’t expect,” 
Pizarro said. “You know, I’m a graphic designer. 
Graphic designers tend to be more shy, more intro­
verted. And I do exhibit some of those things. If I 
embrace something like theater, I’m able to come 
out of my shell as well.”


The pandemic has created new challenges not 
only for Pizarro’s classroom, but for his broader 
philosophy about art’s role in society. “I see artistic 
practice as a social practice, as one that contributes 
to this idea of movement building,” Pizarro said. 
“Take protest for an example,” he continued. “We 
can discuss how protest actually is an art form, right? 
It’s a performance. It’s a performance to inject the 
necessary conversation, because the media is not 
covering it in a way that we want it to.”


Not only are protests a form of communal per­
formance, they’re also a collective of individuals 
using visual art. Protestors make signs, design shirts, 
paint banners, and generally use a visual language 
(a fist in the air, kneeling in silence on the street) to 
express their demands. “It’s such a beautiful thing, 
to understand art as communal,” Pizarro said. 
“We’re taught that art needs to be separate, that it’s 
this precious object we just stare at on a wall. And 
it feels so distant, and we don’t see the artist. But in 
protest, you see all the artists; we’re all there. We 
can dialogue. We can see each other. We can smell 
each other. We can touch each other.”


Of course, the pandemic makes this harder. One 
of the challenges with moving everything online, 
Pizarro said, is figuring out how to preserve a sense 
of genuine human connection. “We have to pour 
more of ourselves into the Zoom process,” he said. 
“We have to open up more, to open up faster, and 
not be afraid to share deep parts of ourselves.”


I met Kwadwo Adae outside his studio on a misty, 
humid Friday in July. He wore a lab coat covered in 
paint splatters of all colors, along with boxy glasses, 
gray slacks, a blue face mask, and orange gloves. He 
gave me a light fist-bump in greeting. Inside his stu­
dio, potted plants sat on window sills, and paintings 
lined the walls—vast canvases of flowers, and por­
traits, many half-finished. Adae creates these paint­
ings in his studio, but he also normally teaches four 
or five classes a week here through the Adae Fine 
Art Academy. Children’s classes are on Saturday, 
adults come during the week. Normally, he also 
teaches art to senior residents at local assisted liv­
ing facilities and to young adults at the West Haven 
Mental Health Clinic.

The assisted living facilities shut their doors in 
February. Adae closed his art academy in March. 
“All of the teaching, all the in-person teaching I’ve 
been doing for the past fourteen years, was just 
unavailable,” he told me. Suddenly, without the 
income from teaching, he was at risk of losing his 
studio space.


Adae began to rely on selling his paintings. 
Luckily, they’ve been popular. “People have been 
coming out of the woodwork,” he said. “A lot of the 
floral paintings have been going.” He allows cus­
tomers to pay in installments because so many have 
lost jobs. He also started teaching online classes. 
On Tuesday evenings, he heads to his studio, sets 
up an Instagram livestream, and records himself 
giving lessons on figure drawing. He asks those who 
watch the video to donate via Venmo. “People have 
been generous,” he said.


Adae had a tight schedule when I met him. 
Artspace had commissioned him to paint nine por­
traits of protestors and community organizers in 
New Haven for their “Revolution on Trial” exhibit, 
commemorating the 50th anniversary of the New 
Haven Black Panther trials. A few of the portraits sat 
beside us on easels while we talked. Each protestor 
stood defiantly in the exact center of a canvas, star­
ing straight ahead. The backgrounds were solid col­
ors, one bright red, one orange, one blue. A mass 
of people with raised fists and protest signs crowded 
each horizon.


Adae, who is Black and the son of Ghanaian immi­
grants, is often out in the streets with the protestors 
he paints. In 2017, he became heavily involved in 
the activist group Justice for Jayson, which emerged 
after Bridgeport police officer James Boulay shot 
and killed 15-year-old Jayson Negron. At one pro­
test, Adae saw Negron’s little sister speak to the 
crowd. “She was 13, tops,” Adae said. “And she got 
on the mic and addressed the protesters and it was 
extremely inspiring—and heartbreakingly sad. She 
should be hanging out with friends. None of this 
should be her life. But because of this incident, it’s 
her life.”


“I cannot just sit and do nothing and watch 
people that look like me get slaughtered,” he said. 
Since then, Adae has continued to be involved in 
local activism. By attending protests over the years 
and around the city, he has gotten to know a hand­
ful of other regular activists in New Haven—many 
of whom became the subjects of his current portrait 
series. 


“These are people that I see in protests, people 
that I’ve linked arms with against cops. And I’ve 
had the thought in my mind, ‘Okay, if this police 
officer swings a baton at this person… I’m getting 
in between them,’” Adae said. “I would take a night­
stick for this person.” And yet, Adae said, even after 
all this, he realized he didn’t know his fellow pro­
testers. He called it “a strange but beautiful rela­
tionship.”


For Adae, art and protest overlap. “Everyone can 
do something to be heard and to stand up against 
an injustice,” he said. Since Adae is trained as a 
painter, he uses those specialized skills “to make 
murals about activism, to paint activists.” Much 
of Adae’s art is community-oriented; it aligns with 
Pizarro’s belief that all art should be a form of 
“social practice.” For example, Adae has painted 
many murals across New Haven — art that is res­
olutely public, not tucked away in a museum or 
a gallery. He’s currently working on a mural in 
Dixwell in response to the shooting of Stephanie 
Washington and Paul Witherspoon by Yale and 
Hamden police officers in 2019. The mural depicts 
four brown sparrows taking flight—small, everyday 
birds, painted large enough to cover the side of a 
building. Sparrows, to Adae, symbolize peace and 
freedom—the very things, he said, that police vio­
lence robs from a community. His mural, he hopes, 
will be a reminder that “We all deserve peace; we 
all deserve freedom.” 


At the end of their program, Pizarro’s students 
produced an exhibit of digital artwork. Actually, 
there were two exhibits—one online, and one in-per­
son at Artspace’s physical gallery, which is publicly 
showing the “Revolution on Trial” until October. 
Online, the works are subtly animated. In Abdulrah­
man Elrefaei’s project, a TV flashes, declaring the 
phrase, “The media does not cover the whole story.” 
In Natalia Maria Padilla Castellanos’s piece, protest 
signs jump gently back and forth, emblazoned with 
phrases like “No justice, no peace” and “Las vidas 
negras importan.” The work depicts a Black Lives 
Matter protest “ascending through the streets of Anti­
gua, Guatemala,” in the words of the artist’s state­
ment. In the front line of the protest are real people: 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Cori Bush, Rigoberta 
Menchú, Nontsikelo Mutiti, Addys Castillo, Ericka 
Huggins. 


At Artspace’s physical gallery, in one room of the 
“Revolution on Trial” exhibit, each student’s proj­
ect is duplicated many times, each replica stacked 
vertically, like a film strip. I thought of Benjamin’s

concept of reproduction and how it undermines aura. 
These projects weren’t sacred; they were accessible, 
lively, and engaging in their directness. 
Kwadwo Adae’s portraits hung in the next room of 
the gallery, and, according to his artist statement, he 
had a similar accessibility in mind: “Adae’s painted 
tributes align the subjects with honorific portraiture, 
a genre typically associated with elite classes,” the 
notes read. “However, here the centralized formats 
and streamlined backgrounds retain a sense of ease 
and immediate accessibility.”


This was democratic art—“the People’s Art,” 
according to the subtitle of the exhibit. And it brought 
to mind something Pizarro had told me. It was some­
thing, he said, that he hadn’t quite worked out for 
himself: a half-formed thought. “I don’t know at what 
point the term ‘art’ became separate from ‘culture,’” 
he said. “Growing up, my parents had what you would 
call ‘art’ all around our house, but these were cultural 
artifacts… whether it was cultural instruments, or 
certain small sculptures we would have around our 
house. For me, art isn’t separate from culture. Cul­
ture is art.”


What would it mean to fully believe that art is no 
different from culture? It would be a radical revision. 
Although we refer to “the arts and culture,” we under­
stand them to be fundamentally different. Art is inspi­
ration, innovation, genius. Culture is the organic, 
unthinking collective. Viewed this way, the very word 
“art” seems tied up in antidemocratic ideals. 


So, what role should artists play right now? The 
same as non-artists, I guess. For some reason, we sepa­
rate art from culture, from social life. We place it apart 
from us, then we ask it to justify itself by demanding 
it does political work. We don’t worry about whether 
“culture” can bring about political change—the 
question barely makes sense. Culture is life, sociality, 
community. It can’t be reduced to political usefulness 
because it is the basis for politics, the reason for poli­
tics. It is political in the sense that all life is political: 
in a society with deadly intentions, the only way to 
really live is to fight for change. 


At the “Revolution on Trial” exhibit, there’s a video 
piece by the artist Chloë Bass. Slow-motion footage 
from the 1970 May Day protests on the New Haven 
Green plays on loop. We see a close-up of Ericka 
Huggins’ face. A narrator recites, delicately: 
“Extraordinary moments and movements and 
things come out of all these normal moments that are 
really kind of boring.”


A banner painted with the words “Power to the 
people” hangs from a building.
“We talk about the crisis versus the chronic. What 
is an incident, and what is an ongoing condition?”


Vapor trails cross a light blue sky.
“It seems all states are equally permanent and 
elusive: emergency, revolution, attachment, care, 
peace.”
