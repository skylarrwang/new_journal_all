Rao an opportunity to reimagine her project in a 
form that respects social distancing measures. “I’m 
resisting the idea of having this be a virtual per­
formance,” she told me. “So if I’m still doing an 
in-person performance, can social distancing be 
an intentional element of blocking the stage? Can 
this parameter, instead of preventing a meaningful 
engagement, become something that’s challenging 
and exciting?”

She imagines something like a silent disco party 
at sunset. Inside a glass building, the performers 
will do their kegels and execute “pelvic floor exer­
cise-inspired choreography.” Sitting outside, audi­
ence members will hear the music through personal 
headphones and watch the light show through glass 
windows. “As daylight fades away,” Rao writes on 
her website about the reimagined project, “Vagina 
Chorus will illuminate the audience’s view and 
mind.​”

“Without the parameters of social distancing, I 
wouldn’t even have thought of [using headphones 
or performing in a glass building,]” Rao told me. 
“And now, these technical elements have become a 
very interesting add-on.”

Other artists have been creating new works more 
or less directly in response to the pandemic. Artistic 
partners Aude Jomini and Eben Kling are working 
on a custom modification (a ‘mod’) to a videogame 
from 1993 — and, in the process, leaving behind 
more traditional gallery spaces. Jomini, an archi­
tect, and Kling, a painter, are frequent collabora­
tors who have contributed to multiple exhibitions 
at Artspace over the past few years. The game 
they’re customizing is called Doom and it nor­
mally involves shooting your way through hordes of 
demons. In the nearly thirty years since its release, 
fans have made countless mods for the game. The 
mod Jomini and Kling are designing is set in New 
Haven and uses original drawings by the two artists 
for the characters, buildings, objects, and weapons 
in the game. Jomini and Kling gave me a tour over 
Zoom; it’s a surreal landscape. We walked around 
a pixelated Long Wharf, the screen-share jumping 
and lagging every so often. Kling’s carefully hand-
drawn characters looked slightly warped on the 
screen, and Jomini’s original buildings, towering 
above the streets, were gray and a little grainy.

The two artists see their project as a refuge from 
the pandemic. When they couldn’t safely go down­
town in real life, they made their own digital down­
town. It felt too passive, Kling said, to spend these 
months just waiting for the pandemic to blow over, 
creating paintings and other physical artworks that 
couldn’t be shown until a safer time.

“I think both of us were already slowly drifting 
away from more traditional gallery spaces,” Kling 
said. “Making art-objects or traditional kinds of 
paintings and putting them in a gallery and having 
people come in and look at them and talk about 
them — it just doesn’t sound very exciting to me 
anymore.” 

Their Doom project is in many ways the opposite 
of traditional studio art. It’s a democratic medium—
anyone can make a mod, with little technical skill 
required. More importantly, it escapes what Jomini 
calls the “baggage” of traditional art. When you 
make traditional studio art, “You’re always pigeon-
holed within a certain discipline and what you’re 
referencing within art history, and there’s a way 
in which that’s so deadly to me,” Jomini said. “It’s 
a kind of death-making—this collecting and sell­
ing and pouring all your thoughts into this object, 
which then becomes precious. That is not really 
interesting to me.”

This idea of art as a precious object, which dwells 
in the dim, regal hall of a museum, is similar to the 
philosopher Walter Benjamin’s concept of “aura.” 
Aura, Benjamin wrote in The Work of Art in the 
Age of Mechanical Reproduction, is the reverence 
we have for “authentic” works of art—the awe we 
feel, for example, in front of the original Mona Lisa 
and not a copy of it. Like Jomini and Kling, Benja­
min believed aura was outdated—and that it would 
be destroyed by the advent of photography, film, 
and other modern forms of mass-producible art. For 
Benjamin, rejecting aura was a political choice. In 
his preface he declares, “The concepts which are 
introduced into the theory of art in what follows… 
are completely useless for the purposes of Fascism. 
They are, on the other hand, useful for the formula­
tion of revolutionary demands in the politics of art.”

But when I asked Jomini and Kling whether they 
saw their artistic practice as political, they answered 
cautiously. Kling called it a “slippery term.” “I do 
think a lot of previous work that I’ve made is social 
commentary to a certain extent. But it’s not really 
political in any kind of partisan way,” said Kling. 
Jomini agreed, saying that she’s wary of thinking of 
art as “a tool” for political messaging. “Yeah, I’m 
wary of that kind of utility, too,” Kling said. “The 
line at which you cross into the world of propa­
ganda is pretty fucking thin.” 

I asked specifically about the Black Lives Matter 
movement—had it prompted any thoughts about

how art can or should engage in political move­
ments? Kling, who is white, said that the question 
is what’s useful to the movement and what’s not. 
For example, he said, “If there is going to be a 
large-scale painting project, [since] I have designed 
and realized large scale murals in the past, that’s 
the kind of thing I would like to utilize in those 
moments. But I don’t know if I’m somebody to go 
back into the studio and make a bunch of paintings 
about the Black Lives Matter movement.” 

Jomini, who is also white, agreed that art was not 
the best medium for her to engage with the BLM 
movement—in part, she said, because it shouldn’t 
be a priority to make white artists a central “part 
of this discourse.” It’s better, she said, to attend 
physical protests, and to work for broader, systemic 
change within organizations. “It’s about doing the 
hard work of sitting on these committees, getting up 
earlier, talking to my boss and talking to other peo­
ple at work and doing outreach to the Yale School 
of Architecture… all these larger organizations are 
what will change the tide.” But, she emphasized, 
that work isn’t part of her artistic practice.

It seems true that institutional change is more 
important than making art about the BLM move­
ment. But it seems equally true that art is not out­
side politics—it’s always implicated in politics, 
because politics pervades all life. Does this mean 
that all artists committed to social justice have an 
obligation to use their art as a form of activism? It’s 
a tricky question. Forcing artists to make art about 
politics won’t lead to meaningful progress—not 
least because they won’t make good art if their sub­
ject is prescribed. But let’s assume you’re an art­
ist who wants to use art to aid social justice. What 
should you do?
