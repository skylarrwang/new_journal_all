I’ve always had a messy feeling about trusting my 
intuition, precisely because it is essentially non-ratio­
nal. Non-rational instincts are out of place in a West­
ern, scientific, largely masculine intellectual frame­
work: therefore, choosing to trust them is an act of 
rebellion. Besides, I’m a very rational person. It’s hard 
to make friends with this inner sense that beats ratio­
nality to the chase, that fills in when rationality turns 
against itself or disappears. 

Right up until February 2020, I would have said 
that intuition didn’t exist, at least not scientifically. I 
don’t believe in God, nor do I believe in ghosts, and, 
as logic goes, I shouldn’t believe in intuition. But now 
I’ve come to see that scientific existence is the wrong 
criteria for thinking about intuition. We should con­
sider intuition within its own conceptual framework, 
in which case the evidence that people feel it should 
be enough. 

“Why is ‘How are you’ the hardest question for you to 
answer?” John often asked me while we were together. 
At the time, he was right: I found it hard to think 
through this question rationally, because my brain pro­
vided counter-evidence to every conclusion I came to. 
How was it really possible to account for everything that 
might influence how I am? The truth was that John 
himself clouded my mind. My brain instructed me to 
use John as a benchmark for how I felt—that if he was 
okay, I was okay. But he had drastic mood swings, and 
I swung with them. I was never sure how much of my 
well-being originated from me, and how much of it 
came from him. Essentially, he muted my intuition. 
But at the end of the day, it was this same intuition that 
rose up and saved me from the relationship; a rescue 
mission that started that February evening in JE. 

“What specifically did he do that was sexist?” John 
had asked me again and again. I listed a few things: 
body language, ignoring me in conversation. But, 
I argued, that wasn’t the point. When I was around 
Mark, I felt ignored. I felt objectified, and, on a good 
day, merely physically uncomfortable. I tried to explain 
to John that these feelings were intuitive. 

But he kept asking me for evidence that would 
explain why Mark made me feel uncomfortable. 
Unless I could prove that Mark did something truly 
reprehensible, John wouldn’t believe me. His thoughts 
went like this—because my intuition is non-rational 
(does not rely on rationality to function) it is irrational 
(nonsensical or absurd). 

John fell into the trap of assuming that his white 
male experience is universal. He believed that his 
method of interpreting and understanding others using 
rationality was the superior one, and relegated other 
forms of judgement to a lower tier. Intuition needed to 
first be translated into his vernacular for him to consent 
to its legitimacy. 

I felt the importance of my experience shrink. Some 
things shouldn’t be translated; they should just be 
taken on their own terms. Intuition is one of them. 

A few weeks after the episode in Jonathan Edwards 
College, my mom came to visit me at Yale. She picked 
me up outside Silliman College, and we left to eat at 
Pad Thai. I started sobbing as she pulled away from 
the curb. At the corner of Temple and Elm Street, she 
pulled over. She knew why I was so upset; she knew it 
was about him.  

“I’m going to ask you one question,” she said. “When 
you think about him, do you get an icy feeling below 
your stomach? Does your heart go crazy, and is it 
hard to breathe? Does that feeling creep up into your 
throat?” 

I nodded, mutely. How had she known? 

“That’s your intuition. The feeling is fear. Many 
women have this sense; I’ve had it too. You have to get 
out of this relationship.” 

I could only nod again. Far, far inside me, beyond 
my deep love for John, was the knowledge that my 
mom was right, a knowledge lodged within that very 
same intuition. My rationality hadn’t caught up yet. In 
some ways it still hasn’t, even six months since the rela­
tionship ended. But rationality is powerless against this 
warning from below my navel, at my innermost cen­
ter, the place that feels like my axis of balance. I knew, 
based on John’s behavior over the past few months, that 
I was in some kind of danger. Thanks to my mom, I 
could now name the feeling itself: I chose to call it my 
woman’s intuition.
I believe this intuition is a foundation of my woman­
hood—passed down from my mother to me. In many of 
the infinitely different manifestations of strong woman­
hood, I’ve noticed this common thread—this beautiful 
watchdog strength. 

Much of the internet (and individual male friends

and relatives I’ve spoken with) thinks that wom­
en’s intuition is chimaera-like. They associate it with 
“magic,” “auras,” and (here we go down this infinite 
rabbit hole of sexism) “witches,” when it’s the opposite: 
reliable, ever-present, assertive. I believe in my intu­
ition more than I believe in most things.

Is women’s intuition only experienced by cis women? 
I’d argue that isn’t the case. I wasn’t born with this intu­
ition. Instead, it has developed within me as a reaction 
to the experience of performing female gender iden­
tity. (Intuition is also influenced by many other facets 
of identity such as ethnicity, race, class, and sexuality, 
although here I concentrate on gender). Women’s intu­
ition develops as a reflex in anyone who has experi­
enced socialization as a woman in a patriarchal society. 
It is necessary to our survival. By springing me to my 
feet in JE, it functioned as a seasoned defense mecha­
nism. Later, I wished that I had stayed; I wished that I 
had, in the moment, told John that it was wrong to ask 
Alex to validate my experience. I wished that I’d stood 
up for myself. But I’m also proud that I left. I had to 
leave, it turns out, in order to realize why I should’ve 
stayed. I had to leave to realize that the icy feeling in 
my stomach was common to my mom, too––that it was 
an intuition we’d developed as women. 

My woman’s intuition isn’t just defensive: it is also 
creative. It leads me to notice emotional and other 
non-verbal cues that men can ignore. It does not at all 
detract from my ability to read a situation rationally; 
instead, it provides another rich layer of interpretation. 
“Most everything I do seems to have as much to do with 
intuition as with reason,” said the writer Susan Sontag.1 
Intuition fosters more complex and sensitive relation­
ships among individuals. It can help women under­
stand other women, as well as men. When men make 
the choice to listen to women’s expression of their intu­
ition, the power of it multiplies: we all have access to a 
more acute and sensitive understanding of the world. 

Just like I had to actually leave that room to under­
stand why that conversation had illustrated sexist con­
ceptions of intuition, I had to exit my relationship to 
understand how it had controlled my worldview for the 
past two years. I had let myself be subsumed by it, result­
ing in ecstasy, despair, and an anxiety that between the 
two I did not actually know who I was. I had teetered 
on the edges of life and thought I had no time for the 
boring middle. I had lost my ability to relax, and with it 
my appetite and sleep patterns. Finally, I had takentook 
up meditation, not as an attempt to achieve more clar­
ity, but as a last-ditch effort to find some kind of cen­
ter amidst John’s emotional extremes and the constant

noise of my flailing rationality trying to make sense of 
things. 

A few days after my relationship ended, the world 
went quiet. Waves of COVID-19 crashed over the 
whole world, and as I began to quarantine at home 
in New York City, I couldn’t fathom how much of my 
world and the entire world had changed all at once. 
The two things I counted on most—school and my rela­
tionship—had disappeared. I didn’t think the extremes 
were ever going to go away; I thought the world was 
telling me I’d never be able to truly gauge how I felt. 
At first, incredibly selfishly, I was a little glad that the 
chaos of the world reflected my own inner chaos. 

Around May, I began to get better, and the world 
got a lot worse. The noise in my own head fell away 
and suddenly, lying in bed one night, I realized that for 
the first time in a very long while I knew how I was—I 
could just sense it. Relief washed over me. Since then, 
I’ve done a lot less thinking, and things have gotten 
simpler. If I want to do something, I do it; if I don’t, 
I don’t. I pay more attention to other people’s body 
language and the physical dynamics of interactions. If 
someone says they have an instinct about something, 
I believe them. In the age of COVID-19, respecting 
people’s intuitions is especially paramount, and allows 
me to take better care of those around me.  

In the middle of August, I met up with my two 
friends Charlotte and Henry on a beach in Cape Cod. 
We were so excited to see each other after unexpected 
months apart that it was a while before we slowed down 
enough to check in with each other. “How are you?” 
Charlotte asked me. I could’ve taken minutes to men­
tally scroll through my uncertainty about taking a year 
off from Yale due to COVID-19 and the varying mental 
well-being of people in my pod. I could’ve searched 
through the expressions of the other beachgoers, hop­
ing they’d contain a clue about how I was feeling. But 
this time I didn’t need to. There was a warmth and a 
peace deep within me. I looked out at the sea, and then 
back at Charlotte and Henry. They really cared how I 
was, me, the me without John, the me who was taking a 
leave of absence, the me who was going into the future 
knowing there was one thing I could always depend 
on: my intuition. “I’m really good,” I said, and smiled. 
“How are you?”
