n early June, Instagram stories were filled with blacked-
out screens and never-ending instructions on how to be 
“a good activist.” Yet while students scrambled for ways to 
get involved in the Black Lives Matter movement, Black 
Students for Disarmament at Yale (BSDY) continued 
what they had been doing for the past year—marching 
on the streets of New Haven for justice and accountabil­
ity with community organizers. On June 13, BSDY joined 
eight other organizations and over 600 students and resi­
dents in a march on the Yale Police Department, in con­
nection with the recent murders of George Floyd, Bre­
onna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, but more specifically 
to call out Yale for the shooting of Stephanie Washington 
and Paul Witherspoon in April 2019. Created in response 
to the April shooting, the organization was still standing a 
year later to protest with the New Haven community amid 
a pandemic.

Tiegist Tay ’22 stood in the sea of socially distanced 
activists who filled the streets outside of the YPD. Artic­
ulate and confident, Tay spoke through a megaphone 
to the crowd, despite the fact that she, like many Yale 
students this summer, was new to organizing. As an 
international student from Kenya, she was uncertain 
about her position in the movement; moreover, she 
admitted to feeling only part of the Yale community, 
and not New Haven, in her previous years. She was 
nervous and felt she didn’t know how to approach New 
Haven organizers. But within moments of meeting 
them, Tay felt overwhelmingly safe and cared for. 

“It felt like I had six mothers...I found a community 
of black people that felt real and tangible to me, and it 
was the first time I had been a part of that since I left 
home.” said Tay. “When I joined Yale they [painted] 
New Haven as if any time I step out of Yale’s campus 
it’s some danger to me... but I have seen nothing but 
love and care and attention...I am sorry if for even a 
second I bought the racist and classist lies that were fed 
to me when I joined this institution“.” 

By listening to and learning from New Haven Com­
munity organizers, BSDY is setting a new precedent 
for organizing at Yale, one that centers the voices of 
dedicated organizers, recreates their spaces of love and 
care, and challenges Yale’s responsibility to their entire 
community. BSDY follows the lead of New Haven 
organizers and passes on the knowledge and language 
they have gained from entering “into community” with 
New Haven.

Ala Ochumare, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter 
New Haven, and an organizer in New Haven since 
2012, holds ideas of care and family at the center of her 
organizing. “I see in the African tradition, the diaspora 
of us and our culture, that, in our best instances, we 
move very familially.” Ochumare continued, “Commu­
nity is made up of the people that I love and like and
