Dear readers,
Whether you are reading this note from a park bench in New Haven, your childhood bedroom, or a place you’ve 
never lived before, we hope these stories bring you back home to our city. We’re wading through a season of 
uncertainty and settling into strange new patterns—wearing face masks while racing against essay deadlines and 
struggling to stay together while speaking over blurry video calls. You may be socially distancing and physically 
alone as you read this, but we hope the voices and experiences that our writers have brought to the page bring 
you a renewed sense of intimacy and community. 

We bring to you the voices of those struggling to find vibrancy and beauty in their religious practice despite the 
closing of synagogues throughout the city. We follow the stories of international Chinese students stuck between 
two clashing nations at the brink of conflict, and students fighting to disarm the Yale Police Department. We 
enter the studios and headspaces of New Haven artists and grapple with the idea of how politics and art should 
intertwine. Slip into the group chats of Librex’s student content moderators, discover what Yale did during the 
last global pandemic, and more.

We’re so glad our magazine ended up in your hands. 
Yours,
Helena & Candice

JUNE
U
nprecedented times. Unprecedented deaths. An unprec­
edented president. In less than a year, unprecedented 
disruption. I am fucking sick of the word unprecedented, but 
I can’t escape it. It’s on every channel, email, and news alert. 
True, sometimes the unprecedented can be wonderful and 
liberating—the train is finally off the tracks. But the unprece­
dented can also be singularly terrifying. There is no reference 
point, no first or second draft to look back on. It’s just us––
people––free-falling through 2020 and making things up as 
we go. If you sit and think too hard about it (as I have been 
doing all of June), everything seems too strange to believe. 
Like we have detached from the natural string of time.
It reminds me of a line from a story by Yalitza Ferre­
ras. This geologist, who has a lifelong obsession with 
rocks, loses part of her hand trying to touch and feel 
molten lava. In the months following the accident, she’s 
lying in bed, unable to move, and her boyfriend comes 
to comfort her: This can’t go on forever, he would say, 
as she felt the layers of forever crushing her down. 
This is often how it feels. A global disease is killing hun­
dreds of thousands of people, and all around us there is loss. 
Hospitals overflow with people who can’t breathe, workers 
lose their jobs, children can’t go to school, and everyone is 
being shepherded quickly and urgently into buildings and 
rooms, so that in the end we lose the ability to move. It feels 
like our lives have been unbuttoned one by one and flipped 
inside out. The school and city that I’ve spent the last three 
years digging fingernails and roots into is shut down, and 
we’re all staring at screens around the world trying to reach 
out to each other.
But I’m also reaching desperately for an explanation. I 
don’t understand how an event so extreme can fit into the 
narrative of my life, or even the narrative of history. I feel that 
there must be a precedent––there has to be one. This can’t 
be the first time that universities shut down, or that the world 
spun into freefall.


I
t made sense to start my search for a precedent with the 
last global pandemic. The influenza pandemic of 1918 is 
largely overlooked in U.S. history; I had never even heard of 
it until this year. Scientists initially thought the virus was just 
a common cold, until it started destroying people’s lungs, fill­
ing them with fluid and causing tissue inflammation. The 
virus infected about 500 million people, a third of the world 
population, and killed 50 million, far higher than the death 
rate of World War I. I wonder how people back then com­
prehended this degree of death and destruction. I wonder if 
they looked for precedents, too. Just like today, people in 1918 
wore masks and avoided large groups. Just like today, Yale was 
completely shut down. There’s little writing about what it was 
like in New Haven back then––it’s almost like people have 
forgotten. 
But Julia Irwin has not. In 2008, the then-doctoral 
student at Yale’s History of Science and Medicine pro­
gram wrote a deep dive historical paper about influ­
enza’s impact on the city. Irwin’s paper is a goldmine. 
She studied how the pandemic affected group relations 
in New Haven, specifically the relationships between 
the city’s largely ‘Anglo’ majority and a newer group of 
working-class Italian immigrants. Irwin is now an asso­
ciate professor of history at the University of South Flor­
ida, and she has been working from home during the 
pandemic. Through the Zoom screen, I can see that she 
has thick, layered brown hair and a warm smile.
Irwin spent the bulk of her early career researching 
pandemics. Even though today her research focuses 
on international history, her voice picks up speed and 
inflates with energy when our conversation pivots to 
public health.
“In epidemics, but also disasters more broadly, those 
sorts of moments reveal issues that are already in societ­
ies that are sometimes below the surface,” she explains. 
“Health disparities, for example, or economic dispari­
ties that are existing but people have become compla­
cent about. An epidemic can bring those to life.”
The influenza epidemic of 1918 was a prime exam­
ple, precipitating a harsh nativist stance against the Ital­
ian immigrant community. According to Irwin, Italians 
died at a rate twice as high as Anglo residents in Con­
necticut. Public health officials used this data to con­
firm the theory that Italians as a ‘race’ had succumbed 
We’ve been through this before.

more to the disease. Yet despite the fact that this prejudice 
became visible during the pandemic, Irwin found that 
Italian and Anglo residents unexpectedly suppressed the 
unrest. 
“Contrary to historiographic expectations, the New 
Haven story is one narrated by piercing silences and a dis­
tinct lack of hostility towards the immigrant community. These 
silences must be understood as a product of the period’s politi­
cal and social context,” Irwin says. 
World War I was coming to a close when the influenza pan­
demic occurred, and Americans were calling for unity and 
cooperation, Irwin explained. Anglo-Americans used the need 
for Americanism to explain why all citizens had a patriotic duty 
to follow public health guidelines. Meanwhile, Italian-Ameri­
cans acquiesced to these guidelines and started to construct a 
public image of themselves as responsible citizens. Instead of 
clashing, leaders of both Italian and Anglo groups supported a 
new end-of-war unity. The shift in New Haveners’ mentalities 
towards one another was a direct result of the time period. 
Today, the same sorts of pervasive health disparities are man­
ifesting in New Haven, but between Black and white Ameri­
cans. Due to centuries of systemic violence, Black people in 
New Haven are the racial group most likely to be hospitalized 
and to die from coronavirus, according to statistics from New 
Haven Mayor Elicker in April. However, unlike in 1918, we 
are not approaching the end of a war but rather the end of an 
openly racist president’s term. Police officers are murdering 
Black Americans in cold blood, and the Black Lives Matter 
movement has taken flight. While the influenza pandemic 
may have smoothed over community fissures in New Haven, 
the coronavirus pandemic has certainly not. 
There are few mentions of Yale in Irwin’s paper, but midway 
through she writes, “During the epidemic, Yale University, a 
centre of significant power and influence in New Haven, quar­
antined itself and ‘refused to let any of the students speak to any 
citizen unless he had a special pass.’”
Irwin details how Yale prided itself on the number of nurses 
it had to care for sick students, and celebrated the fact that just 
three Yale students died. Meanwhile, New Haven suffered from 
a severe shortage in nurses, and the New Haven Register reports 
that the total Connecticut death toll was over fifty-five hundred. 
Yale’s actions today will speak to whether or not it has learned 
from the apathy of its past. A couple months ago, President 
Salovey declined Mayor Elicker’s request to open up some of 
Yale’s empty dorm rooms for public safety officers at risk of con­
tracting coronavirus. 
Elicker criticized Yale, asking, “If your house is burning 
down and you asked a neighbor if your kids could stay at your 
house and your neighbor said ‘no,’ but here is a check so you 
could stay at the Econo Lodge across town, what would that tell 
you about your neighbor?”
The next day, Salovey announced that he would make 
three hundred beds available. But on a city budget call in 
mid-May, dozens of New Haveners demanded that Yale 
do more with its $30 billion endowment. So far during the

JULY
O
n the first of July at nine in the morning, President 
Salovey sends an email entitled ‘Fall 2020,’ announc­
ing that we’ll be returning to campus. It seems impossible. 
I can’t remember a time when my heart didn’t race when I 
left the house, or when I lived without the background noise 
of the hot, screaming TV. I think there’s something about 
staying inside that makes time feel completely stagnant, like 
you could wake up every morning for the rest of eternity 
and you’d still be stuck in the pandemic’s layers of forever. 
Going outside for runs and trips to the grocery store are my 
only reprieve. 
If anyone could tell me whether people felt like this 
before, it would be Judith Schiff. She prefers to talk 
on the phone, so I call her from the landline in my 
basement. Schiff is the chief research archivist of Yale 
Library’s Manuscripts and Archives and the city histo­
rian of New Haven. She grew up in New Haven, went 
to Hillhouse High School, and has been working at Yale 
for over forty years. 
Our conversation meanders. I ask one question, and 
Schiff slides seamlessly down tangents of history, often 
losing me in the enormous network of knowledge she 
holds. We talk about how Yale was founded, the origin 
of Skull and Bones, and what Yale school dances were 
like a hundred years ago. But eventually we make our 
way to World War II. 
World War II was one of the most recent instances when 
Yale’s campus was severely disrupted. Charles Seymour, the 
president at the time, supported the war, while many students 
opposed it, causing tension on campus. But when the U.S. 
finally entered the war, all students, regardless of their beliefs, 
were subject to the draft.
“Yale became a sort of ghost town,” Schiff says. “They only 
had enough students to fill two residential colleges, who were 
ineligible for the draft either because they were too young or 
they had disabilities.”
Many formerly enrolled students went elsewhere. Peo­
ple picked fruit on farms to keep up the food supply, some 
became firefighters, and others assumed civic positions. And, 
with students gone, Seymour offered up Yale’s campus as a 
military base. Over the course of the war, twenty thousand 
people came to Yale’s campus for training. Old Campus was 
rented to the Air Force, which trained at Tweed Airport in 
New Haven during the day and slept on campus at night.
“It was a constantly changing student body,” she explains.
When students finally returned in 1946, they called it 
“reconversion.” Seymour welcomed anyone who had sur­
vived the war and wanted to finish their degree back to cam­
pus. Overnight, Yale was transformed from a student body of 
thirty-five hundred to eight thousand students.
“They called any house in New Haven—do you have an 
extra bedroom? Can someone sleep in your basement?” 
Schiff tells me there were hundreds of cots in the gym and 
single rooms were turned into triples. Some of the students 
returning back to campus were married and had babies by 
this point.
“I remember meeting a woman who was married to a Yale 
physician,” Schiff recalls. “She had two babies in diapers in 
one half of a quonset hut on Science Hill.” 
I have to look up what a quonset hut is—it’s essentially a 
steel dome that looks like a can sliced in half. I’m trying to 
imagine hundreds of these semi-circles lined up on Science 
Hill and housing families with babies.
“Of course, there were no disposable diapers in those days,” 
Schiff laughs. 



AUGUST
T
o my surprise, the layers of forever ease up and I 
return to campus. The day I arrive, my friend and I 
go for a socially distanced walk up Prospect Street and Sci­
ence Hill (I am relieved to see that there are no quonset 
huts). We pass fewer than twenty people. It’s strange to see 
Yale so quiet, to walk without weaving around people or 
having the usual litany of semi awkward run-ins. I miss the 
frenzy.
But it’s also fascinating to see campus like this. It’s as if Yale 
has been dropped and cracked open, like a fruit or a large 
glass jar. The shroud of isolation that usually encircles these 
eight blocks has been stripped away, and the pandemic has 
allowed reality to seep in. This is a quieter way of going to 
college, but in many ways it is a more grounded one, free of 
pretenses. My friend tells me that it’s been like this all sum­
mer, and that nearly everyone is seriously social distancing. 
My last interview takes place six feet apart on the chairs 
outside the Yale Art Gallery. I am late and he is early. My 
interviewee wears a green shirt and hat, and he looks strangely 
comfortable on one of the sidewalk’s stiff metal chairs, watch­
ing the cars pass on Chapel Street. He is eighty-five years old. 
Sam Chauncey became a Yale administrator when he 
was just twenty-one. He started as an assistant dean, served 
as Yale’s chief of staff for twenty years, and then founded the 
Yale Health Management Program, the first health/business 
program of its kind at a major university. Now retired, he 
advises students as a Davenport Fellow.
“For the first two and a half months, everything was shut 
down,” he recalls. “I could stand at my building and see all 
the way to Broadway and not see a single human being on 
the street.”
Chauncey’s voice is strong and clear, and if he hadn’t told 
me otherwise, I would have thought he was much younger. 
He smiles often, revealing two slightly crossed front teeth.

“It was great for everyone because you could walk without 
worrying that you’d run into anybody… I try to do six miles 
a day.”

The coronavirus pandemic is not the first pivotal moment 
Chauncey has witnessed at Yale. As chief of staff, he helped 
lead Yale during the radical movements of the nineteen-six­
ties  and seventies, and he contributed to both the admission 
of minority students and women into Yale. Chauncey is best 
known for his leadership during the May Day rally in 1970, 
during which twenty thousand to thirty thousand  protestors 
arrived on the New Haven Green to denounce the arrest of 
Bobby Seale, a Black Panther leader who was put on trial 
for allegedly murdering a fellow Panther member. This is the 
only time since 1950 when Chauncey recalls Yale shutting 
down.

“Every single store on Broadway was boarded up,” he says. 
“There were national guard troops on York Street. So that was 
a very eerie feeling.”

Unlike other universities, which closed their campuses 
and took issue with the protests, Chauncey invited the pro­
testers in. While other campuses erupted into deadly vio­
lence, Chauncey tactfully juggled the needs of protesters, 
police, students, and faculty, enabling the protests to take 
place peacefully. 

“If you look in the sixties, there was a woman named 
Rachel Carson who wrote Silent Spring––she was said to be a 
nut. Everyone said she was crazy. The gay and lesbian move­
ment was beginning and they were nuts. The antiwar people 
were nuts. It turned out that all those things they were preach­
ing were today’s gospel. I think that having society upset and 
your individual life upset is a good thing,” he says. “I’m in 
favor of revolution, quite frankly.”

Chauncey acknowledges that today’s pandemic poses 
unique challenges that the upheavals of the sixties did not. 
While May Day was a disruption caused by people, the pan­
demic is an invisible enemy. The ‘radicals’ who arrived on 
campus were driven by issues they passionately believed in, 
whereas the coronavirus has no ideology. Still, Chauncey 
hopes that Yale students and faculty will find some meaning 
in the pandemic and in society being “shaken up.”

“Every Yale student should ask him or herself––do I want 
to go back and be a Yale student just the way I was a year ago? 
Have I got some new values about things? Maybe my view of 
human life is a little different.”

As I ponder this, he tells me what he himself has learned. 
“Before the pandemic, I usually had two appointments in 
the morning. I was having lunch with somebody, I had two 
appointments in the afternoon. I might be going to a dinner at 
night with somebody in New Haven. Now, you spend more 
time by yourself and I have come to believe that I don’t want 
to go back to normal. I want a new normal.”

In the spirit of Chauncey, I am working on casting 
my gaze forward. In the two weeks we’ve been in New 
Haven so far, my friends and I have barely left our 
house. We cook dinners and sit in circles with our com­
puters and we put our faith in change. 

Nothing has the privilege of lasting forever.

New Haven’s streets feel empty but in the outlines 
surrounding their silence, I can see a loud and resound­
ing respect for this city. Yale, with its sky-high gothic 
towers, has closed and shut down, and the city has 
swelled and sighed with students coming and going. But 
New Haven remains, with a population that outnum­
bers students approximately 10:1, even when campus is 
at its fullest. There are trees that were rooted here when 
campus closed in 1918, when students left for war in 
1945, when protestors came in 1970. There are people 
who remember.

The best part of my new room is that there is a skylight 
in the ceiling. Over the course of each day, I can watch 
light flood different parts of the room. I considered put­
ting a shade on it so I could sleep better, but decided 
against it. If I stand on the right side of my room, I can 
see the Payne Whitney Gym, but if I stand on the left 
side by my bed, I just see open sky. When I feel crushed 
with claustrophobia, I look up.

E
ach person signed the letter with their name, ID, and 
bed number. Some of the metal bunks stood empty, 
an ambiguous remembrance of a former occupant’s 
release or deportation. 

When COVID-19 swept through Massachusetts in 
March, the detainees inside the Bristol County House 
of Correction Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
(ICE) units were stuck sleeping in beds moored three 
feet apart. They were terrified. The fifty-one members 
of Unit B wrote and signed a desperate letter outlining 
their situation, followed days later by a similar plea from 
forty-seven detainees in Unit A. 

Represented by Yale Law School’s Worker and Immi­
grant Rights Advocacy Clinic and the Boston-based 
firm Lawyers for Civil Rights, the detainees filed a law­
suit against Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson 
and ICE officials on Friday, March 27, 2020. Savino 
v. Hodgson sought the release of immigrants detained 
in Bristol County to mitigate the risk of contracting 
COVID-19. The lawsuit alleged that Sheriff Hodgson 
and his staff disregarded social distancing guidelines, 
failed to provide sanitation supplies and personal pro­
tective equipment, and admitted new detainees with­
out taking proper precautions to prevent the virus from 
spreading. 

Massachusetts federal district Judge William Young 
began issuing orders to release detainees in early April, 
eventually freeing around fifty people. But those who 
were allowed to return to their communities found that 
Sheriff Hodgson continued to scrutinize their move­
ments, and people who remained incarcerated reported 
that conditions did not improve.     
	
H
odgson, who oversees Bristol County’s jails and ICE 
detention center, has positioned himself as a severe 
administrator since he was appointed sheriff in 1997. As 
a strong supporter of President Donald Trump, Hodgson 
offered to send incarcerated people to the US-Mexico bor­
der to build Trump’s long-advertised wall in 2017. A photo 
published by The Boston Globe at the time showed Hodg­
son wearing a dark suit jacket decorated with an American 
flag pin and sheriff’s badge. He posed, arms crossed, in 
front of a barbed wire fence. 

Early in his tenure, Hodgson charged detainees five 
dollars each day they were imprisoned in his facility. 
In 2010, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts ordered 
him to return the fees with interest. Undeterred, Hodg­
son testified in 2017 in support of an unsuccessful state 
bill that would have permitted 
his controversial fundraising 
scheme to continue. 
“That very well frames … 
how [Hodgson] thinks about 
incarceration 
and 
punish­
ment, but also his mind­
set when somebody has the 
temerity to challenge what he 
does,” said James Vita, a pub­
lic defender in New Bedford, 
Massachusetts 
who 
serves 
clients inside Bristol County 
House of Correction. 

After Judge Young began 
releasing detainees, Hodgson 
published a list of their crimi­
nal charges, warning in a Face­
book broadcast that “these 
people” could now be “wan­
dering” the streets. Advocates 
said that Hodgson’s purported 
public safety announcement 
was deceptive. “Even if peo­
ple may have been accused of 
crimes in the past, right now 
they are solely detained because they are non-citizens,” 
explained Oren Nimni, a staff attorney with Lawyers for 
Civil Rights.  

Beginning in June, Hodgson petitioned to revoke the 
release of detainees who left their homes in violation of 
a house arrest order. Some people had indeed tried to 
resume their lives, including going shopping or going to 
work, but lawyers found that many supposed violations 
were due to GPS errors. Moreover, Ninmi said his cli­
ents were not well-informed of the precise boundaries 
of house arrest. As a result, detainees were marked as 
non-compliant for going outside to their backyard or 
out front to check the mail. Judge Young has granted 
some of the bail revocation requests, permitting ICE to 
re-incarcerate people. 

In a 2012 article in the Massachusetts-based Herald 
News, Hodgson described himself as a “pit bull on your 
pant leg,” referring to his tenacious advocacy for inmate 
fees. Recently, he ignited public outrage for wearing a 
Confederate flag-inspired tie in a 2003 portrait for the 
Sheriff’s Office. When the photo came to light in June, 
Hodgson denied any association with neo-Confederate 
groups and defended the tie as a patriotic display of red, 
white, and blue. 

Inside Bristol County House of Correction in North 
Dartmouth, people were not in a position to denounce 
Hodgson’s ties; they were des­
perate for soap. The clean­
ing supplies provided by the 
sheriff’s office for the month 
of April ran out after a week, 
according to Ira Alkalay, an 
attorney for several current and 
former ICE detainees. Investi­
gators from the Massachusetts 
Department of Public Health 
(DPH) visited the House of 
Correction in late June and 
confirmed 
concerns 
about 
dirty bathrooms, overcrowded 
cells, and food safety problems 
in the facility’s kitchen. 

Even before the pandemic, 
DPH had reported repeated 
health code violations in Bris­
tol County, including scummy 
showers, 
dusty 
ventilation, 
and inadequate floor space in 
the ICE units. A December 
2019 review of Ash Street Jail 
in New Bedford documented 
grimy toilets, peeling paint, and doors vulnerable to bad 
weather and rodents

Bristol County Sheriff’s Office has historically denied 
or diminished complaints about conditions.

Chinese international students find themselves in the crosshairs of collapsing US-China relations.

P O I N T  O F  D E PA R T U R E


On March 17, Chen* began his eighteen-hour journey from New York City to Guangdong. For weeks, experts had pinpointed New York as the next COVID-19 epicenter, and rumors swirled of an imminent lockdown. His parents asked him to come home. Chen made a list of pros and cons, then booked a flight set to take off from JFK a day later. Before he left the city, he emptied his Upper West Side apartment—where he’d lived for half a year as a graduate student at Columbia—leaving behind only nonessential books, clothes, and furniture, packing as if he would never return.


Three months after arriving home, Chen booked a visa renewal appointment with the U.S. Embassy in Guangzhou. His F-1 visa—the student visa which had granted him a year’s stay in the U.S.—was expiring in August. Mere days before his appointment, he received an email from the U.S. Embassy, notifying him of his appointment’s cancelation. Not just his, but all immigrant and non-immigrant visa appointments at every U.S. embassy in China from June 8 through June 26 had been suspended. The reason provided by the email was limited staffing due to the pandemic.


Chen tried to reschedule the appointment. But whenever he checked the website, no appointment slots were available for F-1 visa holders. For the past two months, he has been regularly scouring the website, looking for an opening. There have been none. He has called the U.S. Embassy three times, seeking clarity, but has received ambiguous responses each time, Embassy representatives saying it is ultimately up to American authorities. His visa expired on Friday, August 14.


Since the first U.S. COVID-19 case was reported in late January, U.S.-China relations—already shaky from a two-year-long trade war—have only continued to deteriorate. The two powers have clashed on every significant frontier, from technology to trade, national sovereignty to human rights, and the pandemic has only amplified pre-existing tensions. Both countries have, at some point, blamed the origins of the virus on the other. President Trump’s popularization of terms like the “Chinese virus” and “Kung Flu” has also proven incendiary, as incidents of Covid-related anti-Asian racism surge worldwide.


Students from both sides are getting caught in the crosshairs of the two countries’ disputes. Chen isn’t

yer for Prisoners’ Legal Services of Massachusetts, these 
inspection scores don’t inspire confidence. 
“If you look across the board at ICE detention, even 
some of the ones that are considered the most dangerous for immigrants have consistently passed inspection 
year after year,” Paredes said. 
The Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit that 
researches mass incarceration, states that the ACA is 
“well known” for accrediting prisons despite reports of 
poor conditions. 
Asked about the primary purpose of Bristol County’s jail facilities, Darling said that they aim to provide 
“care, custody and rehabilitation.” A video published 
by the New Bedford Cable Network in 2015 suggests a 
different objective. In it, Charles Crowley, the sheriff’s 
late chief of staff, states that Hodgson’s goal is for people 
to “dread coming to jail.” Crowley says that Hodgson 
converted a gymnasium to a sleeping unit because his 
facility is “not a country club.” 	
Throughout April, Judge Young considered release 
requests from Bristol County detainees. Meanwhile, 
detainees developed statements about the conditions of 
their confinement, to be presented at a hearing in early 
May. But before the hearing, Sheriff Hodgson paid an 
inauspicious visit to ICE Unit B. 
On Friday, May 1, 2020, Sheriff Hodgson entered 
Unit B to separate a group of detainees for COVID-19 
testing. 
“I told them that it was critically important that they 
go down to be tested at our medical unit down at the 
main building,” Hodgson said at a press conference the 
next day. 
However, according to Alkalay, detainees had reason to believe that Hodgson’s visit was not beneficent. 
Alkalay’s clients told him that previously, detainees who 
were taken for COVID-19 testing were instead placed 
in solitary confinement. The Sheriff’s Office maintained that isolation was a public health practice and 
not a punitive measure. Darling said anyone who tested 
positive, was awaiting results, or displayed symptoms 
but refused testing was placed in medical isolation and 
monitored by health professionals. Notwithstanding the 
facility’s official procedures, Paredes said, “It’s pretty 
consistent... from all the individuals I speak to that there 
was this big fear of using COVID as an excuse to have 
people placed into solitary.” Fearing this isolation treatment, the detainees refused to leave the unit on May 1. 
While detainees were being summoned for testing, 
one of Alkalay’s clients, Marco Battistotti, called to tell 
him what was going on. According to Alkalay, Hodgson interrupted the call by taking the phone and grabbing Battistotti violently. In Hodgson’s telling, he only 
approached Battistotti after calling his name, and he 
denied physically attacking Battistotti. He claimed that 
the other detainees in the unit rushed at him and one 
person threw a chair. Afterwards, Hodgson left the room 
and gathered an armed team of corrections officers outside. 
At the May 2 press conference, Hodgson referred to 
Battistotti as a “con man” who “spends all his time on 
the phone talking to advocacy groups, pushing false 
narratives.” Vita described him much more modestly. 
Unlike many other detainees, Battistotti is fluent in 
English. “By default, he ended up in a position where 
he could communicate in writing and verbally with 
people who have authority over there,” Vita said. “The 
sheriff is not used to somebody being that forceful in 
pressing for rights and for accommodations,” so he 
identified Battistotti as someone to intimidate. 
Several minutes after Battistotti dropped the phone, 
another man picked up and told Alkalay in panicked 
Spanish that the detainees were being gassed. According to Alkalay, officers released tear gas through the air 
vents, deployed two stun grenades, and shot detainees 
with rubber bullets. 
Three detainees were hospitalized following the 
incident, including one who had a seizure and another 
whose breathing was obstructed by a rubber bullet in 
his throat. According to Rafael Pizarro, an organizer 
with Bristol County for Correctional Justice (BCCJ), 
the statements detainees had prepared for the May 
hearing “mysteriously disappeared” from their lockers 
following the confrontation with the officers. 
After the incident, Battistotti and the others who 
refused testing were put in solitary confinement. For 
three days, Alkalay says, Battistotti was left totally naked 
in an air-conditioned room. “I live ten miles from 
there,” Alkalay said. He sat in a well-lit office, in front 
of a framed painting of a sailing ship. “To think that my 
clients are being held naked for days…” he trailed off. 
“It’s just shocking, it really is.” Battistotti was in solitary 
confinement for sixty consecutive days. 
When Vita visited the jail, Battistotti passed him a 
small styrofoam cup to illustrate the food rations he was 
receiving. On it, Battistotti had estimated his servings in 
pen. About one third of the way up the cup’s battered 
side, he wrote “pasta.” 


 11
His cell in solitary confinement consisted of a bed, a 
cement desk and stool, and an attached toilet and sink. 
His quarters also included an additional ornament: a 
bullet casing. As Vita understands it, his client was 
taken out of his cell to shower, and when he returned 
the casing was on the floor. Battistotti had not seen it 
before he left, and he believes it was placed there as a 
threat. 
Before May 1, Battistotti’s English literacy had helped 
other detainees communicate their needs. Afterwards, 
the provisional community within Unit B was fractured. 
“I think one of the things that Hodgson was able to 
accomplish after May 1 was breaking up these groups of 
people and putting them in different units in the main 
building,” said Vita. “And I think that was intentional.” 
While Battistotti and other detainees faced isolation, 
activists outside the jail gathered to protest. BCCJ has 
opposed Sheriff Hodgson since the organization’s founding in 2017, and recently circulated a petition demanding that Hodgson take down the Confederate tie portrait 
in his office. Lindsay Aldworth of BCCJ asserted that 
Hodgson’s tie and the allegations of abuse in his custody 
are closely linked. “He cannot be wearing Confederate 
ties, he cannot be doubling down when asked about it, 
and he can’t be treating community members as he is,” 
Aldworth said.
Hodgson’s portrait sparked outrage in a county and 
nation already roiled by the killings of George Floyd, 
Breonna Taylor, and other Black Americans at the 
hands of the police. On June 18, BCCJ joined with 
Black Lives Matter activists for a rally in downtown New 
Bedford, where not for the first time, protesters called 
for Sheriff Hodgson’s resignation.  
Bristol County’s Black civil rights activists have historically existed adjacent to and in tension with the 
local incarceration system. Dr. LaSella Hall, president 
of the New Bedford NAACP, noted that New Bedford’s 
Ash Street Jail is the nation’s oldest operating jail, and 
the New Bedford NAACP is one of the organization’s 
older branches. 
Hall has thick-framed rectangular glasses and a piercing gaze even over Zoom. He described Hodgson’s tenure as one component of a criminal-legal system that 
has traditionally placed white men in positions of power 
and black men behind bars. “There’s no political will to 
get rid of [Hodgson],” Hall asserted. “Massachusetts is 
overwhelmingly white, and it’s overwhelmingly people 
who… don’t want to talk about [race].” If Hall’s assessment is correct, it might explain why Hodgson’s constituents are not up-in-arms about his role as an advisor 
to the Federation for American Immigration Reform, 
an anti-immigration organization the Southern Poverty 
Law Center has designated as a hate group.
Aspects of the May 1 incident stand out in the wake 
of the murder of George Floyd. Attorney John Swomely 
said that the detainees were made to lay on the ground 
with their wrists bound by zip ties. “There are detainees 
who, when dropped to the ground, had [correctional 
officers] hold them down by standing on their necks,” 
Swomely said at a May 27 webinar presentation. Paredes also heard that officers placed their knees on people’s backs and necks, evoking the restraint used to kill 
Floyd. Darling confirmed that detainees were zip tied, 
but denied that they were held down by their necks.
Four months after the incident, Battistotti remains 
imprisoned at Bristol County House of Correction. 
And five months after the first detainees were released, 
they remain under strict house arrest. In early August, 
the plaintiffs’ lawyers asked Judge Young to loosen the 
house arrest conditions. “It’s really difficult to not be 
able to even go and buy groceries for your family or go 
to a medical appointment without notifying the court or 
without notifying ICE,” Nimni said. 
Around August 23, officials placed Battistotti back 
into restrictive housing. Neither he nor Vita received a 
justification, but Vita suspects that the sheriff was retaliating against Battistotti for expressing his concerns to a 
DPH investigator earlier that month. Battistotti is still 
seeking release under the Savino lawsuit, but according 
to Vita, he is “very discouraged with the entire process.” 
Activists in and around Massachusetts continue to 
push for state and federal officials to sanction Sheriff Hodgson for the May 1 incident and the detention 
conditions in Bristol County. However, as the county’s 
electoral politics stand, the sheriff appears unlikely to 
be unseated. Even if someone were to challenge Hodgson, Hall does not expect a sea change at Bristol County 
House of Correction. “Let’s say you get a nicer guy, he 
takes down the Confederate flag,” Hall said. “Guess 
what? We’re still putting people in boxes.”

**Title: The Decoupling of U.S. and China**
**Author: Meher Hans**
**Page number(s): 13-15**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
alone in struggling with visa issues—the lives of 
Chinese students in the U.S. have been upended 
by recent China-specific policies that endanger 
student visa procurement and renewal. And 
with the cancelation of intercultural programs 
like the Peace Corps and Fulbright in China, 
American students hoping to strengthen their 
understanding of China and forge transnational 
connections are being denied the opportunities 
to do so. All of these are signifiers of an ominous 
trend—what experts are calling a complete 
decoupling of the U.S. and China, and perhaps 
even a new Cold War.


The stakes of visa approval are especially 
heightened for Chinese citizen and Yale Law 
School student Yao Lin. Yao is 36, bespectacled 
and effortlessly eloquent, a Chinese national 
from the coastal province of Fujian. He speaks 
to me from his study in New Haven, a teal, light-
soaked room lined with shelves of books stacked 
like Jenga blocks, occasionally pausing to soothe 
the fussy 2-year-old on his lap. He says he cannot 
return to China anytime soon, as he fears the 
fall-out from his history of political activism.


For years, Yao advocated in China for feminism, 
LGBTQIA+ rights, and migrant workers 
without facing much backlash from the government. 
Then came his criticisms of President Xi 
Jinping’s policies. He wrote his critiques publicly 
on WeChat, Weibo, and Douban, and even 
authored an op-ed for a Hong Kong-based website. 
In 2017, he denounced the government’s 
eviction of millions of migrant workers from Beijing, 
and a year later, the removal of term limits 
to Xi’s presidency.


In 2018, he was invited by Peking University 
to teach a summer course on political philosophy. 
But a few days before the course was scheduled to 
begin, the department told him he was 
no longer allowed to teach the class, per a verbal 
order from the Ministry of Education. A substitute 
teacher replaced him. Yao knew then that 
his teaching career in China was over.


Under President Xi’s administration, academics 
who have spoken out against the government 
have faced severe consequences. Xu Zhangrun 
and Zhang Xuezhong, professors and vocal critics 
of the Chinese government, are prominent 
examples of this trend. Xu and Zhang believe 
they were fired by their respective universities, 
and since had their teaching privileges suspended 
because of their criticism of one-party 
rule, the removal of term limits to the Chinese 
presidency, and the government’s Covid-19 
response. In the last few months, they were both 
detained by Chinese authorities for unclear reasons, 
but have since been released.


For fear of similar treatment, Yao decided to 
leave China. At that point, he had already been 
admitted to Yale Law School, so he decided to 
join his wife Yuan in New Haven. Yuan had 
already been studying at Yale for five years, pursuing 
a doctorate in philosophy and caring for 
their young children. In 2018, Yao reunited with 
his family. As he and his wife progressed through 
graduate school, they planned for careers in 
American academia.


In May, they learned that the Trump administration 
was considering suspending the 12-month 
work authorization program Optional Practical 
Training (OPT). Yuan, who was slated to graduate 
from Yale that month, had applied for an OPT and 
needed its approval to not only begin her position at 
a university in Virginia the following semester—but 
also to remain in the country.


They worried for several months, fearing the visa 
approval would never come. On July 7, finally, Yuan’s 
OPT application was approved. “If the approval 
didn’t come by the end of July, she would have lost 
her job,” Yao said.


That means, for now, they get to stay. Yuan will 
be an Assistant Professor at Virginia Commonwealth 
University this semester, teaching philosophy 
courses remotely. Yao will complete his final year of 
law school, and apply for an OPT himself this time 
next year. The U.S. has become their home. Their 
children, a girl and a boy, both born in America, 
know no other country as well as this one. But as a 
family, they continue to hold their breath.


“These small things have a day-to-day psychological 
effect on us,” Yao said. “Even if all of these difficulties 
can be resolved, we live in constant anxiety, 
fear and worry.”


As students in STEM, Yale School of Medicine post-
doctoral student Zhao* and third-year graduate 
student Xu* are among the cohort of Chinese students 
who are especially scrutinized by the U.S. government. 
Over the past few months, the Trump administration 
has made significant political moves that indicate a 
growing suspicion of Chinese students, especially 
those studying STEM. In May, President Trump 
issued a presidential proclamation banning Chinese 
graduate students and researchers suspected of ties to 
the Chinese military from entering the country on a 
F- or J-visa. In June, Senators Tom Cotton and Marsha 
Blackburn introduced the SECURE CAMPUS Act to 
Congress. The bill would effectively bar Chinese students 
from receiving visas to the U.S. for graduate or 
postgraduate studies in STEM fields.


Senators Cotton and Blackburn have increasingly 
accused China of intellectual property theft and 
espionage. After the contents of the SECURE CAMPUS 
Act were released in May, Senator Blackburn 
tweeted: “Beijing exploits student and research visas 
to steal science, technology, engineering and manufacturing 
secrets from U.S. academic and research 
institutions. We’ve fed China’s innovation drought 
with American ingenuity and taxpayer dollars for too 
long; it’s time to secure the U.S. research enterprise 
against the CCP’s economic espionage.”


The Trump administration has also cracked 
down on graduate students, researchers, and professors 
with possible ties to China to prevent espionage and 
intellectual property theft. In January, the 
Department of Justice (DOJ) charged the chair of 
the department of chemistry and chemical biology 
at Harvard with one count of making a false statement, 
accusing him of concealing his connection to 
Wuhan University of Technology and China’s Thousand 
Talents Plan. DOJ also charged a Boston University 
robotics researcher who hadn’t disclosed her 
involvement with the Chinese army, and a Chinese 
cancer researcher with stealing and trying to smuggle 
21 vials of cells from a Boston medical center.


Zhao and Xu understand that their identities as 
Chinese graduate students in STEM might complicate 
their visa renewal processes.


Zhao hasn’t been home in the past two years, ever 
since he first left northeastern China for America. 
This year, he’d planned on finally returning home—
his sister is getting married—but the pandemic, coupled 
with the current political climate, has changed 
his mind.


His J-1 visa expired in April of last year, and going 
home would mean having to get it renewed in order 
to re-enter the U.S. He feared the visa renewal process 
would be prolonged by his being a Chinese 
STEM student—the exact demographic Senator 


Cotton and his political allies are trying to exclude 
from the country—and couldn’t take the risk of being 
stranded in China indefinitely. “I am still working on 
my [research] project. I need to take care of my lab 
mice,” he said. “If I go back to China for one or two 
months and then can’t come back because of visa 
problems, it will be terrible for me.”


Due to similar fears, Xu, who is from inner Mongolia, 
hasn’t gone home recently either. Her F-1 visa 
expired last year.


“Science graduate students [from China] have 
always had a hard time applying for visas,” said Xu. 
“But now, the situation is getting worse. I’ve heard 
of [postdoctoral students] being sent back to China 
even though their research is not at all military-related. 
They worked in biology, like me, and I have 
no clue why they were in that situation. My friends 
and I are really worried that our research or our lives 
will be affected by these new, unpredictable policies.”


Zhao is perplexed by the political rhetoric villainizing 
Chinese STEM students like him. “Scientists 
have nationalities, but science itself doesn’t have 
nationalities,” he said. “For me, I come from China, 
but with the science I am doing now, it’s beyond 
countries.” He paused for a moment. “That’s how we 
think of it in the scientific community, anyway.”


Buried in President Trump’s July 14 executive order 
addressing Beijing’s installation of a National Security 
Law in Hong Kong is a provision ending the Fulbright 
exchange programs in Hong Kong and China. 
The programs’ cancelation came six months after the 
Peace Corps withdrew from China without so much as 
a press release.


Founded in 1946 by Senator J. William Fulbright, the 
Fulbright Program is an international 
educational program created for the “promotion of 
international good will.” Fulbright has operated in 
China since the days of the Nationalist Government, 
prior to the establishment of the People’s Republic 
of China in 1949. Over the past 40 years, more than 
3,000 scholars from the U.S. and China have participated 
in the U.S.-China Fulbright Programs.


Grace Jin ’20 was supposed to leave for Hangzhou in 
March 2021. She’d spent a year applying 
for the Fulbright Program in China, and learned of 
her acceptance this April. As a Global Affairs major 
who’d been on the pre-med track, she’d wanted to 
do public health field work before starting medical 
school. “I wanted to apply all of the research skills I 
had learned at Yale to a project in a community that 
I was a part of,” said Jin. Her project on population 
aging and community-based care for elderly populations 
was to be conducted in Hangzhou, the capital 
city of the province she’d called home from first to 
fifth grade. She saw it as her chance to engage with 
the community near her grandparents’ hometown.


In mid-July, Jin learned of Fulbright China’s cancelation 
reading the news on the President’s July 14 
executive order. But she wasn’t certain of the program’s 
termination until an official email from the 
Fulbright Commission confirmed her suspicions. 
The email cited the President’s executive order and 
provided no further explanation.


Although she was disappointed, Jin wasn’t surprised 
by the news. She believes both governments 
are heading toward a complete decoupling and 
rejection of diplomacy. “There are a lot of ideological 
conflicts [between the two countries] to be dealt 
with seriously, but ending a program like Fulbright, 
which is necessary for understanding, is counterproductive.”

ductive,” she said.
Joyce Wang ’17, a 2017-2018 Fulbright China 
participant, had loved her experience with Ful­
bright, during which  she researched mental health 
outcomes for “left-behind children” in Changsha, 
Hunan. “People in Fulbright understand that China 
can be the aggressor,” said Wang. “I am so angered 
and disappointed by the program’s cancelation 
because I don’t see the point of it. I don’t know how 
Fulbright China’s cancelation helps the situation in 
Hong Kong.”

But she’s inspired by the support gathering around 
Fulbright. A Change.org petition imploring the 
President to restore the Fulbright China and Hong 
Kong programs has accumulated 2,379 signatures as 
of September 5.

This year’s cohorts of Fulbright China and Hong 
Kong participants have been given the option of 
being reassigned to a different host country and have 
until August 21 to submit new proposals. Jin is con­
sidering the programs in Taiwan and Singapore.

“Honestly, Fulbright brings disproportionate ben­
efits to the U.S.,” Jin said. “In addition to academic 
exchange, it can use citizen diplomacy abroad to 
increase understanding of American culture, history 
and politics.”

As a Chinese-American, Jin is concerned about 
domestic anti-Chinese xenophobia, as well as 
zero-sum confrontation on the global stage. She 
said, “Ending Fulbright, a program meant to foster 
mutual understanding, it’s the ultimate sign that 
U.S.-China relations have reached a point of no 
return.”

From their homes in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen 
and New Haven, twelve Chinese students express 
to me that it’s getting harder for them to be in America, 
and to justify to themselves and others their desire to 
be in this country.

They are acutely aware of anti-Asian racism: every 
single one of them knows someone who’s experi­
enced it. Yao mentions an incident at Pho Ketkeo, 
a Laotian and Thai restaurant on Temple Street in 
New Haven, where a vandal dented the restaurant 
owner’s car and wrecked the windshield of a serv­
er’s vehicle in April. Like the server and restaurant 
owner, he suspects that the vandalism was racial­
ly-motivated, part of a larger trend of anti-Asian hate 
crimes increasing in the U.S. since the start of the 
pandemic.

Li*, a third-year graduate student at the Yale 
School of Medicine, has been the victim of two 
racially-charged events in the past year. At the end of 
March, a passerby who encountered Li on her walk 
back home from East Rock yelled, “Fuck you, stu­
pid Chinese people bringing the coronavirus here, 
go back to your country.” A year ago, on York Street 
in downtown New Haven, a man pointed at Li and 
exclaimed to the whole street, “A spy! A spy!”

These students were all enticed to come to the 
U.S. for different reasons: the promise of a liberal arts 
education, intellectual opportunities they weren’t 
exposed to at home, and a desire to broaden their 
horizons and see another part of the world. Now, 
many of them are exploring alternative plans in the 
event that U.S.-China relations worsen: Europe, 
Canada. Or simply going home.

Yao tells me that watching the two countries 
deepen their rift has been heartbreaking. He dis­
agrees with many of the U.S. administration’s immi­
gration policies, and opposes China’s recent actions 
against Hong Kong as well as the mass internment of 
Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. 
“The two countries I love, the two countries I want 
to make better, seem to be going the directions I 
abhor,” he says. “But what can I say, what can I do? 
There’s an old Chinese saying that humans do their 
best and leave the rest to the heavens.”

It was snowing as I walked down High Street one 
February evening, furious. Why had I left Jonathan 
Edwards College so fast? Why had I known, in a split 
second, that I could no longer stand to be in that room? 
I had just told John, my now-ex boyfriend, that I felt 
uncomfortable in my encounters with his friend Mark, 
another man. Mark and I knew each other from class 
freshman year. We never hung out one-on-one, but 
during group hangouts after dinner, or when I sat next 
to him during a meal, Mark would only address ideas 
about philosophy and theory to the man I was with. 
He’d nod, if anything, in my direction, while angling 
his body towards the other man. If I attempted to join 
the conversation, he’d pretend that he didn’t hear what 
I said. The only time Mark showed personal interest in 
me was when he learned I was single. Immediately, he 
asked me to dinner and spent the entire night talking 
about sex—staring deep into my eyes, he talked about 
the wonder of sexual harmony, clearly trying to get me 
to sleep with him. As soon as I started dating someone, 
Mark resumed ignoring me, apart from the occasional 
appraising once-over of my body. I was no longer avail­
able for sex, and therefore no longer of interest to him. 
Immediately after I relayed my experiences to John, 
he turned to our friend Alex, the other man in the 
room. “But I’ve never seen Mark do anything sexist,” 
John said. “Do you think he’s sexist?” This question, 
addressed to Alex, not me, was startling. Something felt 
off—I was talking about my experience with Mark, not 
John’s, and not Alex’s. 

I left that room in JE before I even knew I was leav­
ing, before I recognized that the icy feeling driving me 
to my feet was fury. As I crossed Elm Street and strode 
through Cross Campus, my thoughts began to crystal­
lize. John had asked another male to validate my dis­
comfort. There were several problems with this: first, 
that John doubted my feelings in the first place, and 
second, that he had needed confirmation from another 
male to confirm that my intuition—my sense, as a 
woman, that I was encountering sexism—was ‘correct.’ 
I don’t believe that men should be excluded from dis­
cussions of sexism—far from it. But neither John nor 
Alex had any right to decide whether my feelings were 
valid.

Nowadays, I know when I’m in danger, and I know 
when I have to leave. I know when I’m safe, and when 
I can let my guard down. But I wasn’t always confident 
in my judgement. First, I had to identify their source. 
These feelings of intuition arise not from my brain but 
from my gut. 

So what is intuition, really? For me, it precedes ratio­
nality. It manifests before I read a situation analytically. 
It’s a feeling, but not an emotion. I cannot remember 
life without it, but it only started to feel important in 
adolescence, when I began to think more critically 
about my gender in relationship to others. At around 
sixteen, I was no longer able to leave my sense of female 
identity, and the particular intuition that came with it, 
at the door. When I entered a space with other people, 
I began to notice how they reacted to my performance 
of gender. Some guys looked over my whole body. I 
began to learn, based on their glance, whether to avoid 
or approach them. Over the years, this intuition has 
intertwined itself with my relationships with men in 
all the spaces I inhabit: the street, the library, parties,

apartments, parks––and yes, even in class.
I’ve always had a messy feeling about trusting my 
intuition, precisely because it is essentially non-ratio­
nal. Non-rational instincts are out of place in a West­
ern, scientific, largely masculine intellectual frame­
work: therefore, choosing to trust them is an act of 
rebellion. Besides, I’m a very rational person. It’s hard 
to make friends with this inner sense that beats ratio­
nality to the chase, that fills in when rationality turns 
against itself or disappears. 

Right up until February 2020, I would have said 
that intuition didn’t exist, at least not scientifically. I 
don’t believe in God, nor do I believe in ghosts, and, 
as logic goes, I shouldn’t believe in intuition. But now 
I’ve come to see that scientific existence is the wrong 
criteria for thinking about intuition. We should con­
sider intuition within its own conceptual framework, 
in which case the evidence that people feel it should 
be enough. 

“Why is ‘How are you’ the hardest question for you to 
answer?” John often asked me while we were together. 
At the time, he was right: I found it hard to think 
through this question rationally, because my brain pro­
vided counter-evidence to every conclusion I came to. 
How was it really possible to account for everything that 
might influence how I am? The truth was that John 
himself clouded my mind. My brain instructed me to 
use John as a benchmark for how I felt—that if he was 
okay, I was okay. But he had drastic mood swings, and 
I swung with them. I was never sure how much of my 
well-being originated from me, and how much of it 
came from him. Essentially, he muted my intuition. 
But at the end of the day, it was this same intuition that 
rose up and saved me from the relationship; a rescue 
mission that started that February evening in JE. 

“What specifically did he do that was sexist?” John 
had asked me again and again. I listed a few things: 
body language, ignoring me in conversation. But, 
I argued, that wasn’t the point. When I was around 
Mark, I felt ignored. I felt objectified, and, on a good 
day, merely physically uncomfortable. I tried to explain 
to John that these feelings were intuitive. 

But he kept asking me for evidence that would 
explain why Mark made me feel uncomfortable. 
Unless I could prove that Mark did something truly 
reprehensible, John wouldn’t believe me. His thoughts 
went like this—because my intuition is non-rational 
(does not rely on rationality to function) it is irrational 
(nonsensical or absurd). 

John fell into the trap of assuming that his white 
male experience is universal. He believed that his 
method of interpreting and understanding others using 
rationality was the superior one, and relegated other 
forms of judgement to a lower tier. Intuition needed to 
first be translated into his vernacular for him to consent 
to its legitimacy. 

I felt the importance of my experience shrink. Some 
things shouldn’t be translated; they should just be 
taken on their own terms. Intuition is one of them. 

A few weeks after the episode in Jonathan Edwards 
College, my mom came to visit me at Yale. She picked 
me up outside Silliman College, and we left to eat at 
Pad Thai. I started sobbing as she pulled away from 
the curb. At the corner of Temple and Elm Street, she 
pulled over. She knew why I was so upset; she knew it 
was about him.  

“I’m going to ask you one question,” she said. “When 
you think about him, do you get an icy feeling below 
your stomach? Does your heart go crazy, and is it 
hard to breathe? Does that feeling creep up into your 
throat?” 

I nodded, mutely. How had she known? 

“That’s your intuition. The feeling is fear. Many 
women have this sense; I’ve had it too. You have to get 
out of this relationship.” 

I could only nod again. Far, far inside me, beyond 
my deep love for John, was the knowledge that my 
mom was right, a knowledge lodged within that very 
same intuition. My rationality hadn’t caught up yet. In 
some ways it still hasn’t, even six months since the rela­
tionship ended. But rationality is powerless against this 
warning from below my navel, at my innermost cen­
ter, the place that feels like my axis of balance. I knew, 
based on John’s behavior over the past few months, that 
I was in some kind of danger. Thanks to my mom, I 
could now name the feeling itself: I chose to call it my 
woman’s intuition.
I believe this intuition is a foundation of my woman­
hood—passed down from my mother to me. In many of 
the infinitely different manifestations of strong woman­
hood, I’ve noticed this common thread—this beautiful 
watchdog strength. 

Much of the internet (and individual male friends

womanhood—passed down from my mother to
me. In many of the infinitely different 
manifestations of strong womanhood, I’ve noticed 
this common thread—this beautiful watchdog 
strength.” 


and relatives I’ve spoken with) thinks that wom­
en’s intuition is chimaera-like. They associate it with 
“magic,” “auras,” and (here we go down this infinite 
rabbit hole of sexism) “witches,” when it’s the opposite: 
reliable, ever-present, assertive. I believe in my intu­
ition more than I believe in most things.

Is women’s intuition only experienced by cis women? 
I’d argue that isn’t the case. I wasn’t born with this intu­
ition. Instead, it has developed within me as a reaction 
to the experience of performing female gender iden­
tity. (Intuition is also influenced by many other facets 
of identity such as ethnicity, race, class, and sexuality, 
although here I concentrate on gender). Women’s intu­
ition develops as a reflex in anyone who has experi­
enced socialization as a woman in a patriarchal society. 
It is necessary to our survival. By springing me to my 
feet in JE, it functioned as a seasoned defense mecha­
nism. Later, I wished that I had stayed; I wished that I 
had, in the moment, told John that it was wrong to ask 
Alex to validate my experience. I wished that I’d stood 
up for myself. But I’m also proud that I left. I had to 
leave, it turns out, in order to realize why I should’ve 
stayed. I had to leave to realize that the icy feeling in 
my stomach was common to my mom, too––that it was 
an intuition we’d developed as women. 

My woman’s intuition isn’t just defensive: it is also 
creative. It leads me to notice emotional and other 
non-verbal cues that men can ignore. It does not at all 
detract from my ability to read a situation rationally; 
instead, it provides another rich layer of interpretation. 
“Most everything I do seems to have as much to do with 
intuition as with reason,” said the writer Susan Sontag.1 
Intuition fosters more complex and sensitive relation­
ships among individuals. It can help women under­
stand other women, as well as men. When men make 
the choice to listen to women’s expression of their intu­
ition, the power of it multiplies: we all have access to a 
more acute and sensitive understanding of the world. 

Just like I had to actually leave that room to under­
stand why that conversation had illustrated sexist con­
ceptions of intuition, I had to exit my relationship to 
understand how it had controlled my worldview for the 
past two years. I had let myself be subsumed by it, result­
ing in ecstasy, despair, and an anxiety that between the 
two I did not actually know who I was. I had teetered 
on the edges of life and thought I had no time for the 
boring middle. I had lost my ability to relax, and with it 
my appetite and sleep patterns. Finally, I had takentook 
up meditation, not as an attempt to achieve more clar­
ity, but as a last-ditch effort to find some kind of cen­
ter amidst John’s emotional extremes and the constant

noise of my flailing rationality trying to make sense of 
things. 

A few days after my relationship ended, the world 
went quiet. Waves of COVID-19 crashed over the 
whole world, and as I began to quarantine at home 
in New York City, I couldn’t fathom how much of my 
world and the entire world had changed all at once. 
The two things I counted on most—school and my rela­
tionship—had disappeared. I didn’t think the extremes 
were ever going to go away; I thought the world was 
telling me I’d never be able to truly gauge how I felt. 
At first, incredibly selfishly, I was a little glad that the 
chaos of the world reflected my own inner chaos. 

Around May, I began to get better, and the world 
got a lot worse. The noise in my own head fell away 
and suddenly, lying in bed one night, I realized that for 
the first time in a very long while I knew how I was—I 
could just sense it. Relief washed over me. Since then, 
I’ve done a lot less thinking, and things have gotten 
simpler. If I want to do something, I do it; if I don’t, 
I don’t. I pay more attention to other people’s body 
language and the physical dynamics of interactions. If 
someone says they have an instinct about something, 
I believe them. In the age of COVID-19, respecting 
people’s intuitions is especially paramount, and allows 
me to take better care of those around me.  

In the middle of August, I met up with my two 
friends Charlotte and Henry on a beach in Cape Cod. 
We were so excited to see each other after unexpected 
months apart that it was a while before we slowed down 
enough to check in with each other. “How are you?” 
Charlotte asked me. I could’ve taken minutes to men­
tally scroll through my uncertainty about taking a year 
off from Yale due to COVID-19 and the varying mental 
well-being of people in my pod. I could’ve searched 
through the expressions of the other beachgoers, hop­
ing they’d contain a clue about how I was feeling. But 
this time I didn’t need to. There was a warmth and a 
peace deep within me. I looked out at the sea, and then 
back at Charlotte and Henry. They really cared how I 
was, me, the me without John, the me who was taking a 
leave of absence, the me who was going into the future 
knowing there was one thing I could always depend 
on: my intuition. “I’m really good,” I said, and smiled. 
“How are you?”

NOTES 
TO 
A 
STUDENT  
ORGANIZER
A former member of Black Students for 
Disarmament at Yale reflects on its 
trajectory over the past year and a half.
BRANSON RIDEAUX
C R I T I C A L  A N G L E

n early June, Instagram stories were filled with blacked-
out screens and never-ending instructions on how to be 
“a good activist.” Yet while students scrambled for ways to 
get involved in the Black Lives Matter movement, Black 
Students for Disarmament at Yale (BSDY) continued 
what they had been doing for the past year—marching 
on the streets of New Haven for justice and accountabil­
ity with community organizers. On June 13, BSDY joined 
eight other organizations and over 600 students and resi­
dents in a march on the Yale Police Department, in con­
nection with the recent murders of George Floyd, Bre­
onna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, but more specifically 
to call out Yale for the shooting of Stephanie Washington 
and Paul Witherspoon in April 2019. Created in response 
to the April shooting, the organization was still standing a 
year later to protest with the New Haven community amid 
a pandemic.

Tiegist Tay ’22 stood in the sea of socially distanced 
activists who filled the streets outside of the YPD. Artic­
ulate and confident, Tay spoke through a megaphone 
to the crowd, despite the fact that she, like many Yale 
students this summer, was new to organizing. As an 
international student from Kenya, she was uncertain 
about her position in the movement; moreover, she 
admitted to feeling only part of the Yale community, 
and not New Haven, in her previous years. She was 
nervous and felt she didn’t know how to approach New 
Haven organizers. But within moments of meeting 
them, Tay felt overwhelmingly safe and cared for. 

“It felt like I had six mothers...I found a community 
of black people that felt real and tangible to me, and it 
was the first time I had been a part of that since I left 
home.” said Tay. “When I joined Yale they [painted] 
New Haven as if any time I step out of Yale’s campus 
it’s some danger to me... but I have seen nothing but 
love and care and attention...I am sorry if for even a 
second I bought the racist and classist lies that were fed 
to me when I joined this institution“.” 

By listening to and learning from New Haven Com­
munity organizers, BSDY is setting a new precedent 
for organizing at Yale, one that centers the voices of 
dedicated organizers, recreates their spaces of love and 
care, and challenges Yale’s responsibility to their entire 
community. BSDY follows the lead of New Haven 
organizers and passes on the knowledge and language 
they have gained from entering “into community” with 
New Haven.

Ala Ochumare, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter 
New Haven, and an organizer in New Haven since 
2012, holds ideas of care and family at the center of her 
organizing. “I see in the African tradition, the diaspora 
of us and our culture, that, in our best instances, we 
move very familially.” Ochumare continued, “Commu­
nity is made up of the people that I love and like and

support them..."
know and the people that I struggle with and don’t like 
and don’t know.” 
Ochumare sees organizing as a way of recreating the 
spaces of care that she remembers growing up around. 
When Ochumare was young she “saw black moms, 
women coming together, due to social economic rea­
sons. We’d all go over to one another’s houses, the cous­
ins, all the family’s kids, the extended family’s kids, and 
we all thought we were just having fun.” Ochumare 
began to laugh. “But in the kitchen these black women 
were coming together to do what we now call mutual 
aid—one person brought the chicken, another brought 
the rice, another brought the vegetables and they made 
it work. They fed their kids and everyone had leftovers 
for the next day.” 
Her organizing language was not learned from just 
growing up black ––it came from great personal sacri­
fice and a willingness to learn. When Trayvon Martin 
was killed in the summer of 2012, she saw the toll that 
type of injustice took on her young son, who announced 
to her that he no longer wanted to be a police officer. 
When she started the New Haven chapter she recalled, 
“I didn’t wanna keep showing up hurt and harmed and 
further perpetuating that hurt and harm on other black, 
brown, queer, differently-abled, and poor folk.” 
She began with CEIO, a year-long educational pro­
gram on the history of community organizing. She cred­
its her learning to not only this program but also to the 
organizers she met in the classroom. An avid reader, 
Ochumare sourced a massive list of book recommen­
dations from organizers like Kerry Ellington, who works 
with People Against Police Brutality, Norman Clemente 
and Chris Garaffa, from Connecticut Bail Fund, Rhonda 
Caldwell and Justin Farmer who hold public office, and 
others from around the state that would be important 
relationships for her years of organizing to come. Eight 
years later and Ochumare is still attending educational 
programs and has created her own anti-rascist workshops.
Something that motivated Ochumare to dedicate so 
much time to education was encountering the import­
ant distinction between “activist” and “organizer”. 
When we spoke, Ochumare identified with mother­
hood, magic, healing, and queerness just as much as 
she did the title of “organizer,” explaining that “activism 
and organizing are two different lived experiences that 
are dependent on each other.” She described activism 
as the first step, like attending a protest, calling a local 
representative, or writing about an issue; all of this is 
being, in some sense, activated. 
 “Organizing is the next step past activation, it’s gal­
vanization—the sharing of education, creating small 
spaces, sharing language, recreating language, doing 
the one on ones, the phone calls, the interviews, et cet­
era,” Ochumare continued. She noted that this distinc­
tion does not separate the activist and the organizer, but 
instead calls attention to the sacrifice organizers make 
in the fight for social justice. They not only organize 
others; they educate themselves, and they are constantly 
at work in the background of every movement.


A
s students, the role of organizing comes with its own 
set of difficulties. As Zoe Hopson, an organizer and 
junior at Yale, explained: “You need to plan out every sin­
gle detail of a protest, even if you have an exam the next 
day. If we can’t figure out how to get people to x, y, or z, 
there’s not gonna be a presence or a protest. Organizing 
would be a lot easier if we knew why Yale was saying no; 
it’s really frustrating to be doing all this work, and [there’s 
the] potential for Yale to ignore it and just be waiting us 
out.” 
Some people view Yale as a closed ecosystem, say­
ing that the University rarely has to answer to the New 
Haven community despite its position as the largest 
land-owner and employer in New Haven and the owner 
of the Yale Police Department, which has jurisdiction 
over the entire New Haven area. “If Yale is gonna have 
such a huge presence in New Haven and such an intru­
sive presence, the community needs to have more of 
a say in what’s going on and have more access to the 
resources and things that we students have,” Hopson 
said.
This relationship between Yale and New Haven fur­
ther complicates the role of activism at the University. 
“I think Yale students were really good at forcing help 
on New Haven and not asking what they needed.” said 
Hopson. “Disarmament was something that was voiced 
by New Haven. We are using our privilege and our

resources to get that need met. This is an organization 
where we get all our energy, all of our ideas, all our 
collaboration, all of our power from the New Haven 
community and we do what they want.”  She added that 
when planning actions like their recent online teach-
ins, or the protests in June, BSDY reached out to orga­
nizers to plan and collaborate. 
For BSDY board member and Yale junior Isaac 
Yearwood, there is a clear reason why these organizers 
should be centered in the conversation: “We are here 
for four years... there are people who have been here 
before us and will be here after us, so the number one 
thing we can do is listen to them and support them and 
do everything in accordance with what’s best for them.” 
As BSDY heads into the new school year, Hopson 
says the organization is looking to collaborate with other 
college campuses in Connecticut and national organi­
zations to form coalitions. It is also working to finalize 
multiple written reports, including a proposal to the Yale 
administration explaining how their new demands could 
be implemented. Jaelen King ’22, another board mem­
ber, is excited to take to the streets with New Haven now 
that school has resumed. “With COVID-19, of course 
our first priority is keeping people safe, so we really have 
to get creative. But the goal is to keep pushing and pro­
viding pressure.”
Hopson, Yearwood, and King have all been involved in 
BSDY since its founding last April and as rising juniors, 
have taken on leadership roles. Over the past year, they 
have learned from New Haven community leaders and 
grown as organizers themselves. King, who serves as the 
executive director, centered the idea of person-to-person 
connection. 
“Sometimes principles and ideas get lost, but at the 
end of the day we are fighting for this individual per­
son to be able to live and be happy,” he said. King also 
said that he has learned how women of color and queer/
trans folk of color have led the movement both nation­
ally and in New Haven. “It’s really powerful to watch 
black women especially be centered and the leaders of 
this movement,” Hopson added. “I want to mirror that on 
campus—where black women’s voices are being heard 
and listened to and respected.”
 “New Haven organizers have taught me how to love 
and how to love unconditionally in the face of absolute 
rejection,” Yearwood said. The action chair of BSDY, 
Yearwood has taken what he has learned from organiz­
ers and combined it with his experience in Yale’s Edu­
cational Studies program, organizing online teach-ins 
open to Yale students, New Haven residents, and any­

one following BSDY on social media.
He said of these events: “The most beautiful part is 
seeing the passion people put into research—you see 
people owning this information making it personal, 
making it their own so when they give it to someone 
else they can do that as well.” As conversations around 
police abolition and defunding enter mainstream con­
versation, he sees education becoming an increasingly 
important part of BSDY and the Black Lives Matter 
movement as a whole. 
Callie Benson-Williams ’23, the finance director 
of BSDY, is excited for what’s to come. “I feel like 2 
months ago no one would have thought defunding 
the police was a realistic idea at all,” she said. “Police 
abolition is something I learned from the New Haven 
activists we worked with. Even before the recent push 
for that, New Haven activists were talking about police 
abolition, prison abolition.”
Y
et as much as the BSDY is looking towards the future, 
its founding as an organization is inextricably tied to 
recognizing the work of organizers that came before, spe­
cifically the work of black women and black queer folk, 
both at Yale and in New Haven. 
After the shooting of Stephanie Washington and Paul 
Witherspoon, Kerry Ellington came to the Afro-Ameri­
can Cultural Center and recounted her own long fight 
against an unjust act of violence over two years prior. 
In 2017, fifteen-year old Jayson Negron was shot four 
times at point blank range by Bridgeport Police officer 
James Boulay. Despite a year of intense organizing and 
fighting by Kerry Ellington and the Connecticut orga­
nization People Against Police Brutality, the Bridgeport 
police cleared the officer of all charges. Ellington con­
nected the feelings of outrage BSDY had to the shoot­
ing of Stephanie and Paul with her lived experience as 
an organizer.
On the student level, BSDY benefited from the expe­
rience of student organizers involved in NextYale back 
in 2015, an organization of primarily black and POC 
women of Yale who organized in response to the actions 
of what some POC on campus called the “Racepoca­
lypse.” In 2019, NextYale organizers Nia Berrain ’19, 
Erika Lopez ’19, Maya Jenkins ‘19 and alum Eli Cebal­
lo-Countryman ‘18 led BSDY’s initial conversations in 
the Afro-American Cultural Center. “This is how I’ve 
seen the class of 2018, 2017, 2015 do things, and I know 
exactly the language they used to get people together,” 
Berrain recalled.
 At the time that BSDY started, the Yale semester 
was also at its typically chaotic end. “I don’t remem­
ber studying for finals because most of my nights were 
spent in the house organizing; every other day there 
was another thing to do,” Hopson said. In April of 2019, 
BSDY collected and delivered over 1,000 complaints 
to YPD, marched with Kerry Ellington and other com­
munity activists, and joined Hamden and New Haven 
residents in demanding accountability from their own 
police departments and cities. “In the midst of turmoil, 
pain, and suffering and a lot of people going through 
things emotionally, mentally, and physically, we used 
those emotions as a rallying cry,” Yearwood recalled. 
Days before the term ended, an assistant to Presi­
dent Salovey emailed BSDY and invited them to meet 
with the President’s Taskforce on Diversity, Equity, and 
Inclusion. “That’s not who we were trying to speak out 
to,” King recalled in response. “We weren’t just trying to

Non-tenure-track faculty at Yale with expiring contracts find themselves jobless during the pandemic.


For Timothy Kreiner, a lecturer in Yale’s English department, the second Wednesday of April began just like any other quarantine morning. From a sparsely furnished room in his East Rock apartment, he opened up the Zoom for his Directed Studies class and watched his students tile his screen as they logged in from all across the world. Time zone differences and pandemic stressors were all but forgotten as they debated the merits of Nietzsche’s Genealogy of Morals, exchanging ideas as freely as they had within the oak-panelled walls of Linsly-Chittenden Hall. But Nietzsche wasn’t the only thing on Kreiner’s mind as he watched the conversation unfold—the university had just announced a hiring freeze that left the employment status of instructional faculty uncertain in the midst of a global pandemic.

The message arrived in Kreiner’s inbox the previous afternoon, with the same blue heading that had come to distinguish all official communication from the Provost’s office. Following other universities across the country, the email declared that Yale would be extending the university-wide hiring freeze that had been enacted at the onset of COVID-19 into the summer of 2021. The hiring freeze didn’t affect tenure-track faculty, who had recently been given a one-year extension on their tenure clocks, but it was less clear what it meant for instructional faculty employed on short-term contracts like Kreiner. “Technically, what happens for those of us on one-year contracts is our contract ends, and then we get hired anew,” Kreiner told me. “Because of the hiring freeze, nobody could say whether that was going to happen at all.”

With his contract set to expire at the end of June, Kreiner had to act quickly. Together with three colleagues in the humanities, he drafted a petition requesting the same one-year contract extension for lecturers that the university had granted to tenure-track faculty in March. “Faculty on expiring contracts are compelled to apply for jobs that have never been so scarce,” the lecturers wrote. “These acts could literally be lifesaving.” By the time they submitted the petition to President Salovey and Provost Strobel on April 17th, they had gathered 875 signatures from students, researchers, and faculty members across the university.

Two days later, Dean Gendler announced that contract renewals for instructional faculty would be determined on an individual basis—essentially the opposite of what Kreiner and his colleagues had requested. Though Salovey and Strobel thanked them for their petition, they too remained silent on the possibility of a universal extension. But at the end of April, the administration appeared to change course, declaring that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) would be issuing reappointment letters to “every instructional faculty member who had been part of [their] curricular planning prior to COVID-19.” In some ways, the announcement was a “complete one-eighty” from the case-by-case renewals that were previously announced.


Still, it was not the universal extension the lecturers called for. The policy excluded the nearly eight hundred instructional faculty who taught in Yale’s other professional schools, and even within the FAS, it didn’t specify who had been included in the pre-pandemic planning. “I don’t want to minimize the gain because it probably meant that a lot fewer people were let go than might have been otherwise,” Kreiner said. “But on an individual level, what it really amounted to saying is, ‘We won’t fire you if we hadn’t already planned to fire you.’ And no one knew who Yale planned to fire.”


Among the individuals whose contracts had been terminated was Aaron Carico, a lecturer in the American Studies department who had drafted the petition with Kreiner. When I spoke with him at the end of June, he didn’t strike me as the typical bookish academic—he beamed from behind his pale pink glasses as he told me about the two nights he spent at New York’s “Occupy City Hall” encampment as part of the nationwide protests against police brutality.


In some respects, Carico had been the ideal candidate for a career in academia. After earning his PhD in American Studies from Yale in 2012, he had held prestigious fellowships at Princeton and the University of Illinois before returning to Yale in 2015, when he had begun teaching on a yearly contract. Just before he learned in the spring of 2019 that his contract for the 2019-2020 school year couldn’t be extended, he had landed a book deal with the University of North Carolina Press. “Having a book come out is the key to unlocking tenure for a lot of folks,” Carico said. “For me, it was when I would be kicked out of the job.”


Like many of his non-tenure-track colleagues, Carico received no explanation for why his employment at Yale was ending. “Don’t take it personally,” his department chair told him, “It’s not a departmental thing.” He explained that the hiring decisions for instructional faculty were made by the deans of each respective school based on factors like course demand and budgeting constraints, directly contradicting what Carico had often been told as a graduate student in the same department. “All the professors said that if you did all the right things, you would land one of these plum positions,” Carico recalled.


For Ruth Koizim, who has worked as a lecturer in the French department since 1983, the contingency of non-tenure-track faculty has been a defining feature of her time at Yale. (She doesn’t like to use the phrase ‘instructional faculty’ because it was a term “awarded to [them] by the administration.”) Even before COVID-19, the employment of lecturers was dependent upon the whims of the administration, shaped largely by economic factors outside their control. Koizim described what happened in the early 2000s, when Yale expanded its selection of language programs and caused enrollments to drop across all courses in her department. “Nobody’s going to say a word about the professor whose class has three students and a teaching assistant,” she said. “But the lecturer, who over multiple semesters has three kids a section, that person is going to be low-hanging fruit. At a certain point, the students will be voting with their feet.”


But the pandemic raised the stakes even higher for non-tenure-track faculty, particularly for those on expiring contracts. The hiring freezes implemented at universities across the country meant that it was nearly impossible to get an interview for another position, let alone a job offer. When April 27th came around and Carico saw that the petition’s request for a universal contract extension wouldn’t be granted, he realized he was likely facing the end of his academic career. “I had known all year and had been preparing for my contract to end,” he said. “But in the midst of a pandemic and, you know, the second Great Depression, Yale and its largess could have done something to ensure that we aren’t without healthcare or a paycheck while everything is going to shit.”


Two weeks after he learned that Carico and another colleague would be losing their jobs, Kreiner reflected on his experience organizing the petition at a virtual teach-in hosted by the Endowment Justice Coalition. (The second lecturer declined to be interviewed for the article, citing the need to preserve their mental health.) Sitting behind the same desk from which he had taught his Directed Studies sections, he questioned whether there was anything worth saving in a system of higher education that placed its financial security above the needs of its teaching staff. For Kreiner and many other lecturers, it had come to the point where their situation’s precarity made it impossible to fully commit to the work they had signed up to do. “The vast majority of undergraduate education is now being performed by people who don’t know whether they’re going to be on campus after next year,” he said. “If we have to spend our time looking for other jobs and worrying when our next contract ends, that comes at the cost of things that need to be thought through with online education.”


For Kreiner, the outlook seemed bleak. Even though he had managed to survive the initial round of budget cuts, his employment was contingent upon the more severe measures the university would inevitably take in the coming years. But the teach-in also offered a more positive vision for what the future of academic discourse could be. The free-flowing dialogue that took place between participants after Kreiner finished speaking was exactly the kind of experience that universities charged a premium for, but it occurred without any institutional involvement at all. In a sense, it answered Kreiner’s question in the affirmative by demonstrating that there were in fact elements of higher education worth saving—but that they didn’t have to exist exclusively within the walls of the university.


Perhaps Carico had realized this by the time we spoke in June, which would explain why he was so energized after returning from the protests despite being newly unemployed. While he hadn’t yet found a job to make ends meet, he had several ideas for what he wanted to do next—maybe mental health advocacy or social work, and certainly something that would allow him to keep writing. “I don’t regret my decision to go into academia—while you’re able to keep a foothold there, it’s a really rewarding and magnetic place,” he said. “It’s just that there’s a very sharp drop off a cliff at the end.” Now, at the bottom of the cliff, he was discovering just how much had been waiting for him.

A
fter shuffling through some pages, Dr. Michelle Silva 
found the passage she was looking for. “Trauma waits 
for stillness,” she read. Silva is a clinical psychologist at the 
Hispanic Clinic of the Connecticut Mental Health Cen­
ter. The bookshelves in her office—packed with clinical 
files, tomes of Sigmund Freud and Ignacio Martín-Baró, 
refugee children’s books, and novels like American Dirt, 
from which she had just read—neatly framed her Zoom 
background. “Usually, people can find ways to cope and 
keep busy,” she said. “But isolation can be stillness in some 
ways—a forced stillness.” As a psychologist with an inter­
est in attachment theory and liberation psychology, which 
engages with themes like systemic oppression in marginal­
ized communities, Silva wondered how the current pan­
demic would complicate an already challenging mental 
health epidemic.


Quarantine, lockdown, and self-isolation, while 
essential to viral disease control, can be deleterious for 
mental health. Humans are social creatures, and the 
pandemic is forcing people to act against their survival 
instincts—to turn away from others. A recent epidemi­
ological review by Dr. Mahbub Hossain and colleagues 
reported that those quarantining in isolation suffer 
greater levels of anxiety, depression, trauma, and other 
adverse mental health outcomes.


On March 23, Governor Ned Lamont issued a state­
wide stay-at-home order. By early summer, New Haven 
schools and universities emptied. The streets were 
quiet, the silence broken only by police cars and their 
projected bilingual recordings of Mayor Justin Elicker 
urging people to social distance and wash their hands 
in both English and Spanish. Almost six months later, 
Connecticut’s consistent and precautious COVID-19 
response has placed it among three other states that 
are ‘on track’ to contain the virus. But the social and 
psychological repercussions of an indefinite pandemic 
have taken their toll. Although reports like those from 
Mental Health America rank Connecticut among the 
states with best overall mental well-being, the pan­
demic has had a deeper impact on the mental health 
of New Haven’s low-income, uninsured, and migrant 
populations, who already disproportionately endure 
psychosocial stressors.


The pandemic and the economic downturn it cata­
lyzed have incited skyrocketing rates of unemployment, 
income loss, and food and housing insecurity. Within 
the New Haven Latin American community that the 
Hispanic Clinic serves, legal status and loss of com­
munity only exacerbates patients’ daily trials. “When 
we think about legal status,” said Silva, “there’s a real 
investment, in the current context, for them to try to 
keep a low profile and remain invisible if they can. The 
pandemic has heightened that sense of separation, of 
isolation, and been really, really challenging for peo­
ple.”


Even procedures like contact tracing, which the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
has signaled as a key factor in slowing the spread of 
COVID-19, pose a perceived risk among undocu­
mented immigrants seeking treatment. A phone call 
asking an undocumented person whom they have been 
in contact with may force them to choose between their 
public health duty and their family’s security. Having to 
grapple with a choice between one’s health and legal 
status, on top of everyday financial stressors, can be an 
anxiogenic experience.


For Silva, seeing her patients struggle with these 
issues is particularly personal. Born to Ecuadorian 
immigrants in Connecticut, she grew up speaking Span­
ish and English. However, with her bilinguality came 
responsibility. Her mother has a chronic medical condi­
tion, and Silva often had to interpret interactions with 
doctors and medical staff. “Doing that cultural broker­
ing and being the oldest of two,” she said, “I very early 
on had experiences of what it feels like to try to access 
services, particularly health services and insurance, not 
knowing the language, and being constrained by things 
like medical insurance.” She feels that this has made 

New Haven’s low income, uninsured, 
and migrant communities shoulder 
the burden of extra mental health 
challenges during the pandemic.

her more sensitive to the realities of some of her clients. 

“For me, the human connection and the development 
of interpersonal relationships [is] really important,” 
she said. After discovering a passion for psychology in 
high school and “sticking to it” through a master’s and 
a doctoral degree, Silva feels she “get[s] to combine the 
personal with the professional in this work. I get to work 
with the immigrant population and, at the same time, 
address mental health-related concerns that [...] impact 
very much people’s overall wellbeing.”

The uncertainty of the pandemic only complicates 
many patients’ access to medical care. Because many 
members of the Latin American community in New 
Haven have low socioeconomic status, they often 
do not have the luxury of working from home at a 
socially distanced desk. “This is one more piece, one 
more stressor,” said Silva. “It’s clearly highlighted the 
disparities that exist in the system for ethnic minority 
communities. […] They are the essential workforce, 
having to go in and work.” 

As disclosed by DataHaven in 2019, 94 percent of 
people in the Greater New Haven area have health 
insurance. However, for communities disproportion­
ately suffering from mental health issues during the 
pandemic, having access to adequate and affordable 
mental health care can be extremely difficult. In 
2017, Milliman, a leading consulting firm specializ­
ing in insurance and health care, released a damning 
report stating that Connecticut had some of the nation’s 
worst disparities for affordable mental heath care access. 
Insurance companies denied patients’ insurance claims 
for mental health treatment at a higher rate than phys­
ical health treatment. Out-of-network patient visits are 
ten times more likely for behavioral health concerns 
than those for physical ones.

Sean Scanlon, Representative from the 98th district 
in the Connecticut General Assembly, took it upon 
himself to right this wrong. His landmark bill, the Men­
tal Health Parity Act (House Bill No. 7125), went into 
effect in January 2020. It requires insurance companies 
to treat mental and physical health claims indiscrimi­
nately and to submit an annual report for accountabil­
ity. Although it’s too early to say if it’s working, Scanlon 
said, he is optimistic because “whenever somebody is 
watching, people act differently.” According to him, 
insurance is one of the greatest reasons why people 
with mental illnesses do not get treatment—a trend that 
began in the 1960s. 

When private insurance was established after World 
War II, said Scanlon, “the standard practice [for men­
tal illness] was still, ‘Let’s institutionalize these people. 
Let’s put them in this big facility and throw away the 
key.’” After a wave of psychiatric deinstitutionalization 
in the 1960s brought about outpatient mental health 
care, insurance companies didn’t cover it. “Only the 
people who had money could afford to access that 
[care]. Everyone else was either becoming homeless, 
living in shelters, or struggling with substance use dis­
orders because they’re using drugs to cope with the fact 
that they have an untreated mental illness,” Scanlon 
said.

These patterns of stigma and neglect deeply influ­
enced Scanlon’s family and his professional life. “My

father, who is no longer alive, struggled with alco­
hol addiction in his life, and I saw that up close,” he 
explained. “I saw that folks like my dad are often the 
kind of folks we like to sweep under the rug and pretend 
don’t exist and don’t talk about.”

When Scanlon was elected in 2014, soon after the 
beginning of the third wave of the opioid epidemic, 
he focused on reform and destigmatization. “I’ve seen 
addiction and understand the damage that it causes and 
the fact that it’s a disease and not a [moral] shortcom­
ing,” he said. For Scanlon, mental health and substance 
use has always been a personal issue, “and it’s a personal 
issue to one in four people in [the U.S.].”

The pandemic provides a major stress test for Scan­
lon’s bill. The Elm City has seen over one hundred 
deaths related to the virus and almost three thousand 
more infections, but for the overwhelming majority of 
the population, the greatest impact on their lives will 
not be physical. It will be mental. “For people who have 
substance use disorder [or other mental health condi­
tions] and haven’t been able to get their treatment or 
see their provider,” argued Scanlon, “[the added] stress

of this virus or perhaps the stress of losing your job 
could manifest itself in a relapse.” If someone living in 
New Haven is dealing with mental illness and is both 
unemployed and uninsured, the chance of them seeing 
a clinician to help them cope with their trauma is often 
“next to none.”


It is precisely this population—unemployed and unin­
sured individuals—that organizations like HAVEN Free 
Clinic seek to serve. HAVEN is a student-run clinic that 
provides all of its patients with medical, legal, and social 
services, including behavioral health care, completely 
free of charge. Although it is student-run, a panel of 
professional advisors supervises each department to 
minimize patient harm and ensure that the rigorous 
standards are met.


Crystal Ruiz, a second-year Masters of Public Health 
candidate in Social and Behavioral Sciences at the Yale 
School of Public Health, is one of the co-directors of 
the clinic’s Behavioral Health Department, or BHD, a 
relatively new addition to HAVEN. “Because HAVEN 
serves a population predominantly made up of Span­
ish-speaking refugee immigrants,” remarked Ruiz, “it 
became clear that they were struggling with a lot of 
trauma, a history of traumatic events that they didn’t 
have any outlet for.”


It can sometimes take months to see a mental health 
professional, said Ruiz. But at HAVEN, people “can 
come in and request an appointment with us weekly, 
and we can see them a lot sooner. If they do require a 
higher level of care, then we refer them to one of our 
partnering institutions like the Hispanic Clinic,” Ruiz 
explained. BHD’s volunteer training program reflects its 
goal of providing more accessible care. The department 
is inspired by Indian psychiatrist Vikram Patel’s philoso­
phy of making up for a dearth of mental health services 
by training community members as “lay practitioners” 
to deliver psychosocial interventions for mild mental 
health issues.


This commitment to community engagement is at 
the core of both Ruiz’s work at HAVEN and her studies 
“For people who have substance use dis­
order [or other mental health conditions] 
and haven’t been able to get their treat­
ment or see their provider, the stress of this 
virus or perhaps the stress of losing your 
job could manifest itself in a relapse.”
	
—Representative Sean Scanlon
at the School of Public Health. After switching from 
an undergraduate program in biochemistry to one in 
medical anthropology, she was “exposed to a lot of the 
intersectionality that is present in health care,” which 
encouraged her to learn about “why certain immigrant 
and refugee communities develop, not necessarily men­
tal disorders, but adopt behaviors that create opportuni­
ties for harm.”


Her academic interests, along with a desire to find 
community within a school that does too little for the 
underserved populations in New Haven, drew her to 
HAVEN. In a city where 44 percent of Latinos either 
received postponed care or no care at all for a health 
condition in 2018, Ruiz is disappointed that she always 
sees the impetus coming from students. Given that Yale 
is a predominantly white institution, however, she is 
not surprised. “It was just weird being presented with a 
really amazing opportunity—studying at the School of 
Public Health—but then not being able to contribute 
anything to the community.” Considering the amount 
of physical and economic resources that Yale takes 
from New Haven, Ruiz wanted to find a way to give 
back, and one of those outlets was through HAVEN. 
“I thought it was great because our main population is 
Spanish-speaking. They’re usually Latinx [community] 
members, and that’s [...] my community, who I identify 
with. Being able to provide direct care to people in my 
community makes me feel like I’m back at home.”


Insurance and a shortage of mental health services 
aren’t the only limiting factors to accessing care, how­
ever. Many living in low-income communities, Silva 
mentioned, also have unequal or sparse access to tech­
nology, which is especially harmful during a pandemic 
when mental health care has gone virtual. “Challenges 
include whether our patients even have access to WiFi,” 
Ruiz started, “if they have a phone that has the capac­
ity to support Zoom or support video conferencing, if 
they have unlimited versus limited minutes, if they have 
access to a quiet space to discuss some of their personal 
medical concerns.”


Both Silva and Ruiz supervised a transition to tele­
health due to the ongoing pandemic. While HAVEN’s 
IT team was able to quickly set up HIPAA-compliant 
communications systems for the clinic as soon as Gov­
ernor Lamont hinted that clinics would have to close, 
virtual health care presents a new set of problems. “It’s 
very hard to see certain signs and symptoms via a laptop 
or a phone screen,” Ruiz said. Some changes in therapy 
have been more prominent. Silva recalls that, in recent 
sessions, “a lot of our time was spent on just checking 
in on people coping with COVID: Do they physically

have any symptoms? [Are they] social distancing, mask 
wearing, [following] all the precautions? [...] We’re still 
trying to find the balance between that piece plus their 
ongoing treatment goals.”
Stigma surrounding mental health, especially in 
Hispanic immigrant communities, poses a significant 
challenge to providing effective virtual care through 
the Behavioral Health Department. State-mandated 
isolation and social distancing measures mean patients 
spend more time at home with their families, which 
makes talking about mental health issues more complicated. In Silva’s practice, many patients “enjoy coming 
to treatment and leaving their homes because a lot of 
their stress is related to their home environment.” The 
privacy and freedom to talk in the office is no longer 
there, which limits how much progress patients make 
on their treatment plans. At HAVEN, this manifests 
itself in limited responses on the questionnaires used 
to screen for symptoms of psychopathology: “There are 
some things you don’t feel comfortable saying around 
other individuals,” Ruiz mentioned. “Much of the time 
when they’re answering our questionnaires, they’ll limit 
their responses to yes, no, yes, no [...]. They don’t feel 
very comfortable with elaborating and providing further 
information.” Ruiz sounded tired over Zoom. After a 
long day of classes, coordinating BHD meetings, and 
participating in clinic-wide subcommittees for research 
and departmental enhancement projects, she understood that her clients were likely also overworked and 
still trying to adapt to the new telehealth system.

through, the city has slowly come back to life. Over 
the summer, a socially distant Wooster Square Farmers’ 
Market reopened, and medical students handing out surgical masks joined the protests against anti-Black police 
violence. At the Hispanic Clinic, Silva’s team modified 
an in-person group program with twice-a-week, three-
hour meetings for Zoom. “Once we were able to use 
Zoom to get the group going again, they advocated for 
stuff like more time and more frequent meetings,” said 
Silva. “There were definitely some bumps along the 
way, [...] but once they got connected, they absolutely 
loved it.” No matter the circumstances, people need 
to feel connected to each other. For Silva, there was 
a clear lesson learned: “Even if there is some discomfort in the process—like the technology piece—they’re 
willing to put up with that, to follow through with their 
treatment.”

Humans are naturally social creatures, but the pandemic has shown that they are adaptable, too. However, as the pandemic continues to rage throughout 
the country, mental health will not just be a priority—
for many, it will become a necessity for survival. 
In the aftermath of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, survivors experienced significant increases in 
sleeping disturbances, depression, and trouble coping with everyday life for years after the pandemic’s 
end, Norwegian historical demographer Svenn-Erik 
Mamelund conservatively noted in 2003. Psychiatric 
hospitalizations also saw an unexpected rise in first-time 
patient admissions in the following years. If past pandemic responses have any bearing on the future, current 
epidemiological trends show cause for concern. “Anxiety is way up, depression is way up, suicidal thoughts 
are way up, [and] using is way up,” said Scanlon. While 
it’s too soon to understand how much COVID-19 will 
affect mental health, one thing Scanlon knows for certain is that the psychological ramifications of the pandemic will persist well after we have a vaccine.

Sitting on my parents’ orange couch while scrolling 
through Librex one afternoon, I came upon a post 
entitled “African-American and Ethnicity studies are 
bullshit.” Tapping on this title, I opened the post, which 
described how these fields of study are “designed to lure 
unsuspecting poc…. by majoring in these, students gain 
no practical skills” and become trapped in “the cycle of 
poverty.”

The post had garnered a significant number of 
upvotes that day, so Librex—an anonymous discussion forum exclusively for Ivy League students à la 
Reddit or YikYak—brought it to the top of my feed. 
Responses ranged from firm endorsements—“This is 
a take I can firmly agree with.”—to dismissive opposition—“Nah you can find a great job no matter what 
you major in.”

The mission of Librex (“‘Libr’ for libre [as in free], 
‘ex’ for exchange”) is to “democratize college discourse and create a space for honest open discussion 
about what’s going on in your campus community,” 
per the app’s website. Ryan Schiller ’21, the founder 
of Librex and currently the only full-time employee, 
released his product on iOS in September 2019. 
Today, the app boasts around 11,000 registered users, 
3,200 of which are active daily, spending over an 
hour on average perusing posts and messaging others 
(though I recently came upon a post confessing a five-
hour Librex binge).  An Ivy League .edu email address is 
required to log on to the platform, and once inside, the 
user is greeted by an infinite scroll of posts.

In an effort to understand the motives behind controversial content on the platform, I matched with the 
student who wrote the post. On the app, users can send 
private messages to the author of a specific post or comment.

Only identified by the Librex UI’s pill-shaped badges 
for each school, the Harvard student explained, “So my 
post is what we call ‘bait’ here on Librex. It’s definitely 
not my true thoughts. I’m just happy a lot of people 
have taken the bait. Although, I’m shocked some people support this.” Eager to incite a reaction, stir up the 
comments section, and amass attention, people bait all 
across the internet—this isn’t by any stretch a feature or 
quirk of Librex. But I was shocked by how shamelessly 
this person owned up to it.

“So you don’t actually believe any of this stuff?” I 
asked to clarify.
   “No I think it’s dumb. I’m black and double major 
in African American studies. Just thought it’d be interesting to see what people thought. I also don’t argue 
with the comments. I’m more interested in seeing how 
it plays out.” Reticent to disclose even their name’s first 
initial for fear of being identified, the user vanished 
back into the app’s anonymous mist after just a few more

questions.

Taking this Harvard student at their word, the post 
would fall in the category of well-intentioned baiting. 
But they just as easily could have lied to me, aiming to 
be a hurtful troll the whole time. In the end, does the 
intention even matter when everything is anonymous?

On any given day, Librexers—this is what they call 
themselves—discuss politics (“Renaming the past”), 
imposter syndrome (“How is everyone so put together 
and so far ahead already???”), and sex (“I’ve never had an 
orgasm”). They express their worries (“My dad is in the 
operating room rn”) and ask critically important logistical questions (“Is toads closed forever?”), but between 
the banal is a world that much more closely resembles 
the digital fringes. Schiller acknowledges that “any time 
there is anonymous discourse among thousands of people, there will be users who don’t contribute positively 
to the discussion.” But how does Librex decide what 
stays and what goes? What is useful, what is hurtful, 
what is truthful? And who makes the decisions?

***

In a February 2020 interview with the Yale Herald, 
Schiller explained that he felt “isolated and alienated” 
after his sophomore year, often wondering if others 
would judge him for ideas brought up in class. He 
wanted to give students a space where they could air 
sensitive thoughts without the fear of being called out. 
Today, Schiller seems much more comfortable 
expressing his views on controversial topics. Casually, 
he revealed to me his belief in the state of Israel (“I’m 
a big religious Jew. I’m also a big Zionist”), which he 
surely knows could be an unpopular stance on Yale’s 
left-leaning campus.

But for those who can’t sit so openly and confidently 
with their ideas, Schiller brought forth a solution. A 
Math and Global Affairs double major without any 
coding skills, he googled his way through every question over the summer of 2019—“how do you make an 
iOS app,” “how do you get it on the Apple Store”—and 
ended up with a basic framework for the application. 
Along the way, he temporarily sought others to help 
him with development, outreach, and design.

The app’s user base stayed small for a while, with 
around 100 daily active users in February 2020, but 
steadily grew as Schiller expanded piece by piece to the 
rest of the Ivy League—from Yale he moved to Dartmouth, then came the rest.

As COVID-19 hit, kicking students off campus 
and sending them home, Librex blew up. The platform teemed with discussion about how schools would 
respond to the virus, when or even if students could go 
back to campus, and what Zoom classes would look like. 
A contentious point of debate on Librex at this time was 
about whether or not Yale should enact a universal pass 
(UP) policy to accommodate the immense range of 
learning environments at home. Over the phone, Schiller praised the platform for providing a place for “people 
[who] didn’t feel like they could speak on their opinions 
[on UP]” publicly. But this open debate, though occasionally productive, also included derisive digs. After 
Yale converted all classes to pass/fail, a post appeared on 
Librex and subsequently made the rounds on Facebook 
and Twitter that simply read “congrats poor people.”

In late May the Twitter account @LibrecksApp 
emerged. The account owner reposts screenshots of 
offensive posts on the platform, mocking Librex’s generous content moderation and circulating especially 
offensive or off-color posts. At the same time, content 
moderation entered the national discourse when, on 
May 26th, Twitter fact-checked the President for the 
first time by placing a label below his erroneous claims 
that mail-in ballots lead to voter fraud. In the following 
weeks, Twitter continued to place warnings on the President’s tweets, attaching a notice of violation of Twitter’s 
content policy for “glorifying violence” over his incendiary re-invocation of the phrase “when the looting starts 
the shooting starts.” The question arose, where does a 
social media platform end and a publication begin?

It’s a debate that may never be resolved. Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook), Jack Dorsey (Twitter), Susan Wojcicki (YouTube), and Steve Huffman (Reddit) are constantly weighing decisions on this question, and some 
have taken more drastic steps than others. In late June, 
Huffman banned over 2,000 subreddits including the 
massive Trump-focused thread “The_Donald” in accordance with a new content policy of no hate on Reddit, 
whereas Zuckerberg has favored inaction, stating that 
Facebook won’t be “arbiters of truth.”  Many Librexers expressed frustration to me about large social media 
companies. One anonymous user told me, “I used to 
love Reddit, but then they caved to the mob” and have 
now moved to Librex for its anonymity and looser moderation policies.


Librex is moderated according to three simple rules:
“Be legal: No spam, threats, or darknet type stuff;” 
“Be a mensch: No targeting individual students or professors (excluding public figures);”  and “Be specific: 
No sweeping statements about core identity groups.” 
If a post breaks the rules, it’s removed. Repeat offenses 
or an especially egregious transgression: the user is 
banned. In theory, it’s a simple rubric.

But stark lines quickly become blurry, black and 
white turning to a mute grey—a post rarely fits neatly

into this scant set of guidelines. This is where the mod­
eration gets fun, S. told me.
S., a junior at Princeton, has been a Librex moder­
ator since April. He entered the volunteer role after 
responding to a Librex posting by Schiller advertising 
open moderator positions (posts made by Schiller and 
other affiliates of Librex are signed with a gaudy purple 
script font “– The Librex Team”). S. interviewed with 
Schiller via the matching feature—anonymously, of 
course—and was accepted shortly thereafter.

Speaking to me through the phone over background 
sounds of his sister playing “Für Elise” on piano, S. told 
me that when a post is reported, it is brought to the 
moderation team for debate. In a Facebook group chat 
alongside twenty-three other volunteer moderators from 
across the Ivy League, S. argues for why or why not a 
post should remain up. The two dozen mods—which 
Schiller told me represent a diversity of socioeconomic 
statuses, countries of origin, political viewpoints, and 
races (over half are PoC)—can debate for hours whether 
or not a post is against the rules.

If there’s too much disagreement in the text chat, 
the moderators will have lengthy video calls. Schiller 
explained to me that the team has built a sort of case 
law, whereby they compare reported posts with past 
decisions in an effort to maintain a consistent modera­
tion scheme. And when Schiller recruits new modera­
tors, he sometimes gives them sample moderation ques­
tions to see how they respond. 
A favorite of his, he told me, is whether or not you 
remove a post claiming that “all men are trash”—a 
question that Facebook used when they were first creat­
ing moderation standards. “There’s no right answer to 
that necessarily,” he told me,  “although I think there 
are better answers and worse answers.” 
The founder said that he would likely message the 
user to let them know that the proclamation is not the 
kind of discourse expected on Librex and the post would 
likely be removed “because it’s a sweeping statement 
against a core identity group.”

Schiller often benchmarks his moderation practice 
against Facebook’s: in another instance, he justified 
that a Holocaust-denial post should remain up by say­
ing “even Facebook allows it.” A disgruntled moderator 
quipped: “ah yes let’s take our moral cues from daddy 
zuck.”

The whole operation has an air of professionalism 
to it until you look at the moderation chat itself. In a 
series of screenshots leaked by ex-moderators, we get a 
glimpse of the post evaluation process.

Before even examining the substance of the chat, 
another detail jumped out at me: pseudonyms the mod­
erators had given each other. There is, for example, 
“Grandmaster’s Padawan,” (S.’s name) “Grandmaster 
Big Brain,” “EtErNaL🍆,” and “Daddy,” which is, unsur­
prisingly, Schiller. The nicknames are transient, con­
tinually edited and tweaked by the moderators: at one 
point Schiller becomes “papi.” “The moderators can be 
silly sometimes,” he told me. 

The nicknames also hint at yet another layer of ano­
nymity, perhaps spurred by the worry that their identi­
ties will be revealed. After screenshots of the modera­
tor chat were first leaked to Twitter in late May by an 
ex-moderator from Dartmouth, there was a palpable 
fear in the chat. After Schiller informed the modera­
tors of the leak, S. writes, “Holy [new message] Shit 
[new message] @Daddy did I get cancelled.” Schiller 
(Daddy) replies, “I think ur ok for now.” A few messages 
later S.’s fear returns: “I’m gonna get cancelled.”

The content moderation chat brings to light the 
debates of what should be allowed to exist on the inter­
net, what is considered hate speech, what is said satiri­
cally versus seriously. These questions are asked behind 
closed doors, which Schiller explained to me is because 
“these are very sensitive issues and oftentimes issues that 
involve identity and involve how we see the world. And 
it’s important that our moderators feel like they are safe 
to actually speak what they think is like [sic] moral.”

The moderator chat, as Schiller described it to me, 
is a discourse unencumbered by judgement, a place 
where moderators feel comfortable to voice their true 
opinions while discussing the complicated politics of 
post removal. 

But an ex-moderator from Dartmouth, who left 
Librex over frustrations with the culture of the com­
pany, described that the chat is full of slights and disre­
spect. In a message they told me, “i started to get really 
tired of the job when there was a conversation in the 


--- Page 35 ---

mod group chat about racist content and i asked if 
we should leave up racist posts even if they techni­
cally lie outside of the community guidelines and 
ryan said yes”—a discouraging instance given their 
impetus for becoming a moderator stemmed from a 
belief that maybe they could be the one to “change 
the content for the better & reduce the harassment/
hate speech.”

The ex-moderator expressed anger over an 
instance in which their moderation decisions were 
overridden by Schiller. In late May during elec­
tions for the Dartmouth Student Assembly, can­
didate María Teresa Hidalgo ’22 and her running 
mate Olivia Audsley ’21 were continually harassed 
anonymously on Librex. The Dartmouth reported 
they were compared to fascists and that one post 
“threatened to call Immigrations and Customs 
Enforcement on Hidalgo… Despite her own Amer­
ican citizenship.” 

After Librex announced that Hidalgo and Audsley 
did not qualify as public figures and therefore could 
not be targeted by name on the platform—a deci­
sion which took several days while the offending 
statements festered on the platform—the ex-mod­
erator began work on deleting the hurtful posts: “i 
started taking everything down (very relieved) but 
[Ryan] put back a ton of posts where only their ini­
tials were used.”

After being called “oversensitive for telling some­
one why the redskins logo was bad and promptly 
made fun of for defending [themselves],” they 
finally resigned as a moderator. “it was just like. 
why do i bother.”

In another instance in the moderator chat, the 
group discusses a post denying the Armenian geno­
cide. Grandmaster Big Brain takes a hard-line 
stance: “it’s not sexist, doesn’t attack a class, just 
reflects the poor state of historical education.” 
Another moderator responds, “it’s like… denying 
genocide.”

Big Brain retorts, “Yes, but it doesn’t go against 
the rules [new message] Trust me, I find it disgust­
ing—but at the same time we are not policing for 
facts.” 

Schiller affirmed this belief to me over email. I 
asked how Librex deals with misinformation and he 
replied, “In general, the Yale community is good 
at pointing out misinformation through comments 
and voting.” He believes in minimal regulation: 
falsehoods should remain on the platform and be 
downvoted to the bottom of the feed rather than 
moderated away.


Schiller’s platform allows Ivy League students to 
explore ideas and learn from each other, as many 
users told me. While matching with people, almost 
everyone I spoke with loved the app (selection bias, 
of course), and most accepted the trolling as a nec­
essary inconvenience.  
J., a Columbia student who quickly matched 
with my post soliciting user interviews, explained 
that he’d actually learned a lot from Librex and had 
his beliefs challenged and changed. He told me 
that as a Chinese-American, he often felt resent­
ment towards the ways affirmative action disadvan­
taged Asian-American college applicants, until he 
had some conversations on Librex that helped him 
build a more nuanced understanding of the lasting 
effects of slavery and prejudice against Black peo­
ple. “[Librex] helped me be more receptive and less 
apathetic and self-interested than I was before.”

Schiller’s quest to give students a platform for 
free speech and debate has been certainly realized: 
speech is definitely free, debate plentiful. But the 
extent to how far “free” should go, and whether the 
outcome of that decision is good, is another ques­
tion entirely. Although access to anonymous speech 
on Librex is spread equally across the Ivy League, 
the bigoted posts enabled by the anonymity tend 
target certain groups more heavily: Black students, 
overweight students, undocumented students, 
transgender students, among other minorities.

One critic of Librex, Anyoko Sewavi (Dartmouth 
’23), who posted a YouTube video in July reacting 
to racist Librex comments from other Dartmouth 


--- Page 36 ---

 36
students, told me that she initially witnessed produc­
tive discussions and believed anonymity was a “good 
concept.” But “then came the trolls.” Sewavi, who 
is Black, told me that “seeing that Dartmouth is the 
main school writing racist comments is just unnerv­
ing, it’s uncomfortable, and honestly it’s just exhaust­
ing to see…. I wouldn’t know if I walked across cam­
pus and someone felt this strongly about me being 
Black.” 

Our phone call finished on an optimistic note, with 
Sewavi explaining to me that the relatively small size 
of Librex enables opportunity for systemic change on 
the platform, and perhaps social media as a whole: “If 
they take trolling seriously, and there’s actual conse­
quences for these comments and actions, then maybe 
in the future it will snowball and set an example for 
other anonymous social media apps.” 

Others have also spoken out against the app, such 
as the actress Skai Jackson who posted on Twitter 
screenshots of Librex posts with the caption “This 
app is called Librex, so sad people are saying disgust­
ing things on here…” The attached posts claimed 
“Fellow racists. I have a plan to increase racism” and 
“Black people need to learn grammer [sic].” It’s hard 
to know if the posts were eventually removed.

Librex as a platform does not create the cesspools 
of flippant, divisive callouts that sometimes permeate 
its users’ devices. Rather, the anonymity gives these 
ideas a convenient breeding ground. The platform is a 
magnifying glass on the internet—a tangible diorama 
of the same behavior that permeates the bigger social 
sites. I recently came upon a post with 22 upvotes 
confessing: “For a forum filled with Ivy League kids, 
the content here is remarkably similar in quality to 
Reddit and 4Chan.” Yet this behavior feels much 
closer to home when we see it on Librex. We know 
that the content that so often ends up being debated 
in the moderation chat is made by the people that live 
around us, that attend class with us.

On Librex, offensive posts appear often—posts 
about why undocumented people should just move 
to Canada, or how the n-word “triggers libtards.” 
But despite the occasional moderation blunders, my 
experience browsing the app has gradually included 
less and less brazenly insulting content since I down­
loaded it in April. Perhaps the moderation team has 
honed their technique in an attempt to balance strict 
free speech and the app’s role as a useful and good 
platform. But the internet’s propensity to breed bigots 
and fuel flame wars, intensified by Librex’s feature of 
facelessness, may be insurmountable.

Schiller conceded to me that any online commu­
nity has its bad apples—a statement that felt a bit 
like admitting it’s the fault of the water and not 
the holes in the hull that causes a ship to sink. But 
when a leak does emerge and trolls inundate the 
platform, anonymity protects and emboldens some 
while others bear the brunt of unchecked speech.

**ART IN CRISIS**
**Author: Eli Mennerick**

D
aniel Pizarro was eating cereal when I met 
him, pale sunlight pouring from a window 
beside him. He sat in his East Rock home that July 
midmorning while I sat a few miles away at my own 
apartment, in front of a laptop screen. Even over 
Zoom, Pizarro’s voice was warm. He had curly, dark 
hair and a full beard.

Pizarro is a graphic designer. When the pan­
demic arrived and the shutdown began, he lost 80 
percent of his client-based jobs. Luckily, though, 
he’s found new work through his connections 
with New Haven nonprofits and grassroots organi­
zations. For the last year and a half, he said, he’s 
been trying to build a name for himself by using 
his graphic design skills to further social justice 
work in New Haven. He’s designed flyers, videos, 
posters, and graphics for Junta for Progressive 
Action, Cancel Rent CT, and City Wide Youth 
Coalition, among other groups. “Some of it’s been 
paid and some of it hasn’t,” he told me. “But that 
community has really held me through this pan­
demic.”

Across the country, artists face a fate similar 
to Pizarro’s. As of August 24, Americans for the 
Arts estimated that 94% of artists in the U.S. lost 
income due to the pandemic—an average of 
$22,200—and 63% became unemployed. The 
total income lost, they reported, was $50.6 bil­
lion. As author William Deresiewicz wrote in The 
Nation this May, “The major basis of much of 
the contemporary arts economy—live, in-person, 
face-to-face events—has been destroyed.”

This past summer, Pizzaro led a three-week 
youth program at a local arts nonprofit called 
Artspace. The program was supposed to be in-per­
son. But after the pandemic arrived, Pizarro and 
the other program coordinators reimagined the 
entire curriculum, reducing the number of stu­
dents from around twenty to only eight. They pur­
chased iPads, styluses, and animation software for 
the students. The class met on Zoom and focused 
on digital art. Miraculously, the transformation 
was a success. “They’re all making amazing art,” 
Pizarro said during the second week of the class. 
“And they pick up on it so quickly.”

The summer course—Artspace’s Summer 
Apprenticeship 
Program—explored 
graphic 
design as a tool for activism, using the art of the 
Black Panther Party from the 1960s and 70s as a 
model. The curriculum’s focus on the Panthers is 
one of a few initiatives Artspace has developed this 
year to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 
New Haven Black Panther Trials, including a gal­
lery exhibition inspired by the legacy of the Panthers 
and a podcast about the trials in New Haven. Lisa 
Dent, the Executive Director of Artspace, told me 
that these projects had been scheduled for a couple 
years—well before the pandemic, and well before 
the protests in response to the murder of George 
Floyd. But the projects suddenly became timelier 
than anyone expected. 


After the murder of George Floyd, protests swept 
the nation. According to The New York Times, 
between 15 and 26 million people had partici­
pated in the protests by July 3, making it the largest 
protest movement in U.S. history. These protests 
pushed the long-standing injustices of systemic rac­
ism and anti-Blackness into mainstream attention 
and prompted many people to work toward change 
within their disciplines. For those in the art world 
committed to broad political change, the questions 
are, in Dent’s words, “How do artists engage in 
social justice? How can artists support that work or 
be supported during that work?” 

According to Pizarro, the students in Artspace’s 
Summer Apprenticeship Program discussed how 
lessons from the Panthers can be applied to the 
contemporary Black Lives Matter movement. 
“We’re not telling them what 
to do, but we’re allowing 
them the space for self-ex­
pression, and to contribute 
to this idea that artists in 
this moment do have a role 
to play.”

“Some of the main messaging that [the Panthers] 
talked about, like police brutality, is directly par­
alleled with the BLM movement in this moment,” 
Pizarro said. 

But what exactly, is the connection between art 
and activism? What can art do that, say, protest and 
community organizing cannot? Pizarro emphasized 
that art is profoundly personal and expressive and 
that it can help individuals find their voices within 
a movement. “The students are trying to figure their 
place out, and they’re creating work that directly 
speaks to that,” Pizarro said. “We’re not telling them 
what to do, but we’re allowing them the space for 
self-expression, and to contribute to this idea that 
artists in this moment do have a role to play.”

It’s one thing to say that artists have a role to 
play in this moment. It’s another to clarify those 
terms. What role, and which moment? How exactly 
should art engage with a protest movement—not to 
mention a pandemic? 

T
he category of art, and even of contemporary 
visual art, is vast—perhaps too vast to generalize 
usefully about what role it should play right now. Dif­
ferent kinds of art will inevitably engage with social 
justice in different ways. 

Althea Rao, for example, decided to put her proj­
ect Vagina Chorus on hold during the pandemic. 
Until the end of July, Rao was an Artist-in-Residence 
at Artspace, which means she had around-the-clock 
access to studio space owned by the nonprofit. 
Vagina Chorus, one of the projects Rao was devel­
oping in that studio, involves a group of perform­
ers using a “vaginal insertive pelvic floor trainer” 
combined with a “Bluetooth enabled bio feedback 
algorithm” to “sonify the internal movements, pro­
ducing immersive light effects and a symphony of 
sound waves, forming a chorus,” according to Rao’s 
website. In other words, the performers create a 
music and light show by squeezing their pelvic floor 
(an exercise called a kegel). 

The project is designed to address urinary incon­
tinence, which, as Rao told me, “is closely tied 
to childbirth, menopause, all of these physical 
events that a person who has a uterus might have 
over their entire lifespan.” The major symptom of 
urinary incontinence is leaky urine. Rao said that 
while urinary incontinence has been stigmatized 
and ignored for too long, it was understandably 
overshadowed by the pandemic. “It’s just a matter 
of urgency,” Rao said. “If someone is worried about, 
‘Okay, I don’t even know where I’m going to live 
tomorrow, I cannot physically socially distance, 
and I might die if I get [Covid-19],’ and then you’re 
talking to them about, ‘What about your leaking 
problem?’ they probably won’t want to talk about 
that. It’s not as important.” 

How should Rao’s project engage with the cur­
rent moment? The question sounds misplaced.  If 
your art is about urinary incontinence, then it’s 
about urinary incontinence — not the pandemic, 
and not necessarily the BLM movement. 

Though the pandemic has halted performances 
of Vagina Chorus for a while, it’s also provided

Rao an opportunity to reimagine her project in a 
form that respects social distancing measures. “I’m 
resisting the idea of having this be a virtual per­
formance,” she told me. “So if I’m still doing an 
in-person performance, can social distancing be 
an intentional element of blocking the stage? Can 
this parameter, instead of preventing a meaningful 
engagement, become something that’s challenging 
and exciting?”

She imagines something like a silent disco party 
at sunset. Inside a glass building, the performers 
will do their kegels and execute “pelvic floor exer­
cise-inspired choreography.” Sitting outside, audi­
ence members will hear the music through personal 
headphones and watch the light show through glass 
windows. “As daylight fades away,” Rao writes on 
her website about the reimagined project, “Vagina 
Chorus will illuminate the audience’s view and 
mind.​”

“Without the parameters of social distancing, I 
wouldn’t even have thought of [using headphones 
or performing in a glass building,]” Rao told me. 
“And now, these technical elements have become a 
very interesting add-on.”

Other artists have been creating new works more 
or less directly in response to the pandemic. Artistic 
partners Aude Jomini and Eben Kling are working 
on a custom modification (a ‘mod’) to a videogame 
from 1993 — and, in the process, leaving behind 
more traditional gallery spaces. Jomini, an archi­
tect, and Kling, a painter, are frequent collabora­
tors who have contributed to multiple exhibitions 
at Artspace over the past few years. The game 
they’re customizing is called Doom and it nor­
mally involves shooting your way through hordes of 
demons. In the nearly thirty years since its release, 
fans have made countless mods for the game. The 
mod Jomini and Kling are designing is set in New 
Haven and uses original drawings by the two artists 
for the characters, buildings, objects, and weapons 
in the game. Jomini and Kling gave me a tour over 
Zoom; it’s a surreal landscape. We walked around 
a pixelated Long Wharf, the screen-share jumping 
and lagging every so often. Kling’s carefully hand-
drawn characters looked slightly warped on the 
screen, and Jomini’s original buildings, towering 
above the streets, were gray and a little grainy.

The two artists see their project as a refuge from 
the pandemic. When they couldn’t safely go down­
town in real life, they made their own digital down­
town. It felt too passive, Kling said, to spend these 
months just waiting for the pandemic to blow over, 
creating paintings and other physical artworks that 
couldn’t be shown until a safer time.

“I think both of us were already slowly drifting 
away from more traditional gallery spaces,” Kling 
said. “Making art-objects or traditional kinds of 
paintings and putting them in a gallery and having 
people come in and look at them and talk about 
them — it just doesn’t sound very exciting to me 
anymore.” 

Their Doom project is in many ways the opposite 
of traditional studio art. It’s a democratic medium—
anyone can make a mod, with little technical skill 
required. More importantly, it escapes what Jomini 
calls the “baggage” of traditional art. When you 
make traditional studio art, “You’re always pigeon-
holed within a certain discipline and what you’re 
referencing within art history, and there’s a way 
in which that’s so deadly to me,” Jomini said. “It’s 
a kind of death-making—this collecting and sell­
ing and pouring all your thoughts into this object, 
which then becomes precious. That is not really 
interesting to me.”

This idea of art as a precious object, which dwells 
in the dim, regal hall of a museum, is similar to the 
philosopher Walter Benjamin’s concept of “aura.” 
Aura, Benjamin wrote in The Work of Art in the 
Age of Mechanical Reproduction, is the reverence 
we have for “authentic” works of art—the awe we 
feel, for example, in front of the original Mona Lisa 
and not a copy of it. Like Jomini and Kling, Benja­
min believed aura was outdated—and that it would 
be destroyed by the advent of photography, film, 
and other modern forms of mass-producible art. For 
Benjamin, rejecting aura was a political choice. In 
his preface he declares, “The concepts which are 
introduced into the theory of art in what follows… 
are completely useless for the purposes of Fascism. 
They are, on the other hand, useful for the formula­
tion of revolutionary demands in the politics of art.”

But when I asked Jomini and Kling whether they 
saw their artistic practice as political, they answered 
cautiously. Kling called it a “slippery term.” “I do 
think a lot of previous work that I’ve made is social 
commentary to a certain extent. But it’s not really 
political in any kind of partisan way,” said Kling. 
Jomini agreed, saying that she’s wary of thinking of 
art as “a tool” for political messaging. “Yeah, I’m 
wary of that kind of utility, too,” Kling said. “The 
line at which you cross into the world of propa­
ganda is pretty fucking thin.” 

I asked specifically about the Black Lives Matter 
movement—had it prompted any thoughts about 


**Title: Art, Politics, and the Black Lives Matter Movement**
**Page number(s): 41-42**

how art can or should engage in political move­
ments? Kling, who is white, said that the question 
is what’s useful to the movement and what’s not. 
For example, he said, “If there is going to be a 
large-scale painting project, [since] I have designed 
and realized large scale murals in the past, that’s 
the kind of thing I would like to utilize in those 
moments. But I don’t know if I’m somebody to go 
back into the studio and make a bunch of paintings 
about the Black Lives Matter movement.” 

Jomini, who is also white, agreed that art was not 
the best medium for her to engage with the BLM 
movement—in part, she said, because it shouldn’t 
be a priority to make white artists a central “part 
of this discourse.” It’s better, she said, to attend 
physical protests, and to work for broader, systemic 
change within organizations. “It’s about doing the 
hard work of sitting on these committees, getting up 
earlier, talking to my boss and talking to other peo­
ple at work and doing outreach to the Yale School 
of Architecture… all these larger organizations are 
what will change the tide.” But, she emphasized, 
that work isn’t part of her artistic practice.

It seems true that institutional change is more 
important than making art about the BLM move­
ment. But it seems equally true that art is not out­
side politics—it’s always implicated in politics, 
because politics pervades all life. Does this mean 
that all artists committed to social justice have an 
obligation to use their art as a form of activism? It’s 
a tricky question. Forcing artists to make art about 
politics won’t lead to meaningful progress—not 
least because they won’t make good art if their sub­
ject is prescribed. But let’s assume you’re an art­
ist who wants to use art to aid social justice. What 
should you do?

Art is political “in the sense 
that it’s a kind of occasion… 
the occasion for a whole 
complex of social relations.”
Nontsikelelo Mutiti, a graphic designer and a friend 
of Pizarro’s, also visited. One day during the program, 
Pizarro assigned the students a documentary about 
the Black Panther Party to watch for homework. The 
next day, as a surprise, Pizarro announced to the stu­
dents that Ericka Huggins would be visiting class that 
day. “They were starstruck,” Pizarro said. The stu­
dents got to meet a real-life, former leader of the New 
Haven Black Panther Party, just after learning about 
the Panthers’ historical significance. Huggins spoke 
to the students about Black female leadership and 
the importance of “taking time to heal” during the 
labor-intensive work of activism.


Some days, the students worked on self-por­
traits. Others, they practiced digital typography, or 
creative writing. They even did theater exercises 
together, all without ever meeting in person. 
“With any environment where you meet new 
people, you’re sort of shy in the beginning,” Pizarro 
told me. “But I think that is particularly true with 
how young people behave in a digital space.” His 
students, at first, didn’t want to show themselves on 
camera. “We’re sharing our intimate spaces, like 
our room. Some people might be a little shy about 
that.” But over the three weeks, Pizarro said, the 
students blossomed. He encouraged them to have 
breakout sessions so they could get to know one 
another without his help. The theater exercises, 
especially, helped Pizarro and his students break 
past their discomfort. They forgot their lines, they 
did silly improv skits, they laughed together. “It 
was really a joyful experience that I didn’t expect,” 
Pizarro said. “You know, I’m a graphic designer. 
Graphic designers tend to be more shy, more intro­
verted. And I do exhibit some of those things. If I 
embrace something like theater, I’m able to come 
out of my shell as well.”


The pandemic has created new challenges not 
only for Pizarro’s classroom, but for his broader 
philosophy about art’s role in society. “I see artistic 
practice as a social practice, as one that contributes 
to this idea of movement building,” Pizarro said. 
“Take protest for an example,” he continued. “We 
can discuss how protest actually is an art form, right? 
It’s a performance. It’s a performance to inject the 
necessary conversation, because the media is not 
covering it in a way that we want it to.”


Not only are protests a form of communal per­
formance, they’re also a collective of individuals 
using visual art. Protestors make signs, design shirts, 
paint banners, and generally use a visual language 
(a fist in the air, kneeling in silence on the street) to 
express their demands. “It’s such a beautiful thing, 
to understand art as communal,” Pizarro said. 
“We’re taught that art needs to be separate, that it’s 
this precious object we just stare at on a wall. And 
it feels so distant, and we don’t see the artist. But in 
protest, you see all the artists; we’re all there. We 
can dialogue. We can see each other. We can smell 
each other. We can touch each other.”


Of course, the pandemic makes this harder. One 
of the challenges with moving everything online, 
Pizarro said, is figuring out how to preserve a sense 
of genuine human connection. “We have to pour 
more of ourselves into the Zoom process,” he said. 
“We have to open up more, to open up faster, and 
not be afraid to share deep parts of ourselves.”


I met Kwadwo Adae outside his studio on a misty, 
humid Friday in July. He wore a lab coat covered in 
paint splatters of all colors, along with boxy glasses, 
gray slacks, a blue face mask, and orange gloves. He 
gave me a light fist-bump in greeting. Inside his stu­
dio, potted plants sat on window sills, and paintings 
lined the walls—vast canvases of flowers, and por­
traits, many half-finished. Adae creates these paint­
ings in his studio, but he also normally teaches four 
or five classes a week here through the Adae Fine 
Art Academy. Children’s classes are on Saturday, 
adults come during the week. Normally, he also 
teaches art to senior residents at local assisted liv­
ing facilities and to young adults at the West Haven 
Mental Health Clinic. 


--- Page 44 ---

The assisted living facilities shut their doors in 
February. Adae closed his art academy in March. 
“All of the teaching, all the in-person teaching I’ve 
been doing for the past fourteen years, was just 
unavailable,” he told me. Suddenly, without the 
income from teaching, he was at risk of losing his 
studio space.


Adae began to rely on selling his paintings. 
Luckily, they’ve been popular. “People have been 
coming out of the woodwork,” he said. “A lot of the 
floral paintings have been going.” He allows cus­
tomers to pay in installments because so many have 
lost jobs. He also started teaching online classes. 
On Tuesday evenings, he heads to his studio, sets 
up an Instagram livestream, and records himself 
giving lessons on figure drawing. He asks those who 
watch the video to donate via Venmo. “People have 
been generous,” he said.


Adae had a tight schedule when I met him. 
Artspace had commissioned him to paint nine por­
traits of protestors and community organizers in 
New Haven for their “Revolution on Trial” exhibit, 
commemorating the 50th anniversary of the New 
Haven Black Panther trials. A few of the portraits sat 
beside us on easels while we talked. Each protestor 
stood defiantly in the exact center of a canvas, star­
ing straight ahead. The backgrounds were solid col­
ors, one bright red, one orange, one blue. A mass 
of people with raised fists and protest signs crowded 
each horizon.


Adae, who is Black and the son of Ghanaian immi­
grants, is often out in the streets with the protestors 
he paints. In 2017, he became heavily involved in 
the activist group Justice for Jayson, which emerged 
after Bridgeport police officer James Boulay shot 
and killed 15-year-old Jayson Negron. At one pro­
test, Adae saw Negron’s little sister speak to the 
crowd. “She was 13, tops,” Adae said. “And she got 
on the mic and addressed the protesters and it was 
extremely inspiring—and heartbreakingly sad. She 
should be hanging out with friends. None of this 
should be her life. But because of this incident, it’s 
her life.”


“I cannot just sit and do nothing and watch 
people that look like me get slaughtered,” he said. 
Since then, Adae has continued to be involved in 
local activism. By attending protests over the years 
and around the city, he has gotten to know a hand­
ful of other regular activists in New Haven—many 
of whom became the subjects of his current portrait 
series. 


“These are people that I see in protests, people 
that I’ve linked arms with against cops. And I’ve 
had the thought in my mind, ‘Okay, if this police 
officer swings a baton at this person… I’m getting 
in between them,’” Adae said. “I would take a night­
stick for this person.” And yet, Adae said, even after 
all this, he realized he didn’t know his fellow pro­
testers. He called it “a strange but beautiful rela­
tionship.”


For Adae, art and protest overlap. “Everyone can 
do something to be heard and to stand up against 
an injustice,” he said. Since Adae is trained as a 
painter, he uses those specialized skills “to make 
murals about activism, to paint activists.” Much 
of Adae’s art is community-oriented; it aligns with 
Pizarro’s belief that all art should be a form of 
“social practice.” For example, Adae has painted 
many murals across New Haven — art that is res­
olutely public, not tucked away in a museum or 
a gallery. He’s currently working on a mural in 
Dixwell in response to the shooting of Stephanie 
Washington and Paul Witherspoon by Yale and 
Hamden police officers in 2019. The mural depicts 
four brown sparrows taking flight—small, everyday 
birds, painted large enough to cover the side of a 
building. Sparrows, to Adae, symbolize peace and 
freedom—the very things, he said, that police vio­
lence robs from a community. His mural, he hopes, 
will be a reminder that “We all deserve peace; we 
all deserve freedom.” 


At the end of their program, Pizarro’s students 
produced an exhibit of digital artwork. Actually, 
there were two exhibits—one online, and one in-per­
son at Artspace’s physical gallery, which is publicly 
showing the “Revolution on Trial” until October. 
Online, the works are subtly animated. In Abdulrah­
man Elrefaei’s project, a TV flashes, declaring the 
phrase, “The media does not cover the whole story.” 
In Natalia Maria Padilla Castellanos’s piece, protest 
signs jump gently back and forth, emblazoned with 
phrases like “No justice, no peace” and “Las vidas 
negras importan.” The work depicts a Black Lives 
Matter protest “ascending through the streets of Anti­
gua, Guatemala,” in the words of the artist’s state­
ment. In the front line of the protest are real people: 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Cori Bush, Rigoberta 
Menchú, Nontsikelo Mutiti, Addys Castillo, Ericka 
Huggins. 


At Artspace’s physical gallery, in one room of the 
“Revolution on Trial” exhibit, each student’s proj­
ect is duplicated many times, each replica stacked 
vertically, like a film strip. I thought of Benjamin’s 


--- Page 45 ---

concept of reproduction and how it undermines aura. 
These projects weren’t sacred; they were accessible, 
lively, and engaging in their directness. 
Kwadwo Adae’s portraits hung in the next room of 
the gallery, and, according to his artist statement, he 
had a similar accessibility in mind: “Adae’s painted 
tributes align the subjects with honorific portraiture, 
a genre typically associated with elite classes,” the 
notes read. “However, here the centralized formats 
and streamlined backgrounds retain a sense of ease 
and immediate accessibility.”


This was democratic art—“the People’s Art,” 
according to the subtitle of the exhibit. And it brought 
to mind something Pizarro had told me. It was some­
thing, he said, that he hadn’t quite worked out for 
himself: a half-formed thought. “I don’t know at what 
point the term ‘art’ became separate from ‘culture,’” 
he said. “Growing up, my parents had what you would 
call ‘art’ all around our house, but these were cultural 
artifacts… whether it was cultural instruments, or 
certain small sculptures we would have around our 
house. For me, art isn’t separate from culture. Cul­
ture is art.”


What would it mean to fully believe that art is no 
different from culture? It would be a radical revision. 
Although we refer to “the arts and culture,” we under­
stand them to be fundamentally different. Art is inspi­
ration, innovation, genius. Culture is the organic, 
unthinking collective. Viewed this way, the very word 
“art” seems tied up in antidemocratic ideals. 


So, what role should artists play right now? The 
same as non-artists, I guess. For some reason, we sepa­
rate art from culture, from social life. We place it apart 
from us, then we ask it to justify itself by demanding 
it does political work. We don’t worry about whether 
“culture” can bring about political change—the 
question barely makes sense. Culture is life, sociality, 
community. It can’t be reduced to political usefulness 
because it is the basis for politics, the reason for poli­
tics. It is political in the sense that all life is political: 
in a society with deadly intentions, the only way to 
really live is to fight for change. 


At the “Revolution on Trial” exhibit, there’s a video 
piece by the artist Chloë Bass. Slow-motion footage 
from the 1970 May Day protests on the New Haven 
Green plays on loop. We see a close-up of Ericka 
Huggins’ face. A narrator recites, delicately: 
“Extraordinary moments and movements and 
things come out of all these normal moments that are 
really kind of boring.”


A banner painted with the words “Power to the 
people” hangs from a building.
“We talk about the crisis versus the chronic. What 
is an incident, and what is an ongoing condition?”


Vapor trails cross a light blue sky.
“It seems all states are equally permanent and 
elusive: emergency, revolution, attachment, care, 
peace.”

The Still
Small Voice
of God
Observant Jews in New Haven 
distill beauty and closeness from 
socially distanced religious 
practices.
by Ko Lyn Cheang
A
t 10 a.m. on the Fourth of July, Esther Nash arrived at 
the parking lot of Congregation Beth El–Keser Israel 
in the Westville neighborhood of New Haven for Shab­
bat service. For three weeks, with new COVID-19 cases 
declining throughout the state, the synagogue at Harrison 
Street had been able to hold services in-person, albeit out­
doors. 
That day, the summer sun was high in the faultless 
blue sky. Nash carried a leather-padded brown fold­
ing chair from a cart, which the synagogue staff had 
wheeled out earlier that morning, and took a seat in the 
shade of a large sugar maple tree. 
People sat dispersed across the parking lot in twos, 
threes, or fours, half their faces concealed behind masks. 
At the reader’s table, the Rabbi’s teenaged son, Noam 
Benson-Tilsen, was chanting from the Torah. As he 
chanted, letters became words, words became song, and 
the sonorous melody flowed through the listeners’ ears. 
Congregants bowed as they prayed, rocking their knees, 
the red bound book of scripture and smaller blue book 
of prayers clasped in their arms. Before the pandemic, 
the synagogue’s Rabbi, Jon-Jay Tilsen, led services in 
the synagogue’s sanctuary. His voice would reverberate 
off the laminated wood panelling and fill the high-ceil­
inged, sunlit space. But now, for the 35 people present 
to gather in the sanctuary together, breathing the same 
air, would be a health and safety risk. 
Outdoors, Benson-Tilsen’s voice was muted by the 
wind, dissipated into a low call. From twenty feet away, 
he sounded as though he was standing behind a thin 
wall. 
“God now wants us to sing quietly,” Nash said after­
ward. She was reminded of the prophet Elijah, who 
was sent fleeing South from Queen Jezebel through 
the wilderness of Judah for defending the Hebrew God 
against the prophets of Baal. Through mountain-split­
ting winds, rock-shattering earthquakes, and vicious 
fires, he did not see God. He did not hear Him. Then, 
in the silent aftermath of the blaze, he heard the “still, 
small voice” of God address him. That morning, in the 
synagogue parking lot, Nash thought now was the time 
to listen to the still, small voice of God. 
When he was finished, Noam returned the Torah 
scroll into its blue velvet cover and carried it to the holy 
ark of law, an ornamental chamber which houses the 
scroll. Before the pandemic, a procession of five or six 
people would carry the scroll counterclockwise through 
the sanctuary. The act is symbolic of “bringing the law 
to the people,” Tilsen explained. That day and during 
every outdoor Shabbat service so far, however, the task 
belonged to the Rabbi’s son alone. 
When the pandemic prompted many religious 
groups to convene online, with Zoom worship sessions 
and Friday prayer live streamed on Facebook, the same 
transition could not be applied in certain Jewish com­
munities. 
 Orthodox Jews, who adhere most strictly to Jewish 
law, refrain from using electronics during the Sabbath 
because it is prohibited by Jewish law on the day of rest, 
along with thirty-eight other activities. Some members 
of the Conservative Jewish movement, which believes 
that Jewish law, while binding, should evolve histori­
cally, also do so.  
Many of the Congregation Beth El-Keser Israel’s 
F E AT U R E

Beth El–Keser Israel on a day in late June.  (Photo by: Ko Lyn

Design by Annli Nakayama 
members, including Tilsen’s own family, fall into this 
category. The reasons Tilsen offered for avoiding tech­
nology on the Sabbath are varied: it is a religious com­
mitment, a way of being a good Jew, and a personal way 
of serving God.
And so, when the synagogue closed for the first time 
in its 128-year history on March 16th to help contain 
the spread of the deadly coronavirus, Rabbi Tilsen did 
not hold Shabbat services online. “If you’re going to do 
all these things, then it removes the beauty that we cre­
ated by adhering to constraints,” he said.
In the post-pandemic world, some things can be 
moved to Zoom—calling into a wedding, practicing 
daily prayer, and singing songs together during the 
seder, or the ritual feast that marks the beginning of the 
Jewish holiday of Passover. Many others cannot—hug­
ging a loved one, holding Shabbat service in observant 
Jewish communities, and, depending on who you ask, 
forming a minyan, which is an assembly of any ten Jew­
ish adults (in the Orthodox tradition, specifically men). 
A minyan is required before certain religious rituals can 
be performed, including reading from the Torah and 
reciting important prayers like the kedusha and kaddish.
The Rabbinic definition of a minyan is unequivo­
cal that the ten adults need to be physically present in 
the same space for the group to constitute a quorum, 
explained Tilsen. “So a group that is connected only by 
being ‘on-line’ by zoom or phone does not constitute a 
quorum,” he said. That said, many reform and modern 
synagogues are holding full services, including Torah 
reading and Shabbat services, on Zoom.
Rabbi Fred Hyman, who leads the Orthodox West­
ville shul in New Haven, said, “The kedusha and kad­
dish is a very meaningful part of the service, and we still 
don’t allow it [to occur online]. We don’t just follow 
an emotional response. That’s how strict we are, and I 
think the virtual minyan is misplaced.”
In 1999, Rabbi Maurice Lamm warned presciently 
of a “crisis” in the introduction to a reprint of his 1969 
seminal textbook on deathcare, The Jewish Way in 
Death and Mourning, that would pressure Jewish peo­
ple to succumb to “commercial,” “American,” non-Jew­
ish ways. “The crisis will come, ready or not,” he wrote.
The Covid-19 pandemic appears to be one such “cri­
sis.” The story of religious Jewish communities during 
the pandemic has been one of finding beauty in con­
straint. There has been more continuity, rather than 
change, in their practice of Judaism even as stores are 
shuttered, synagogues are closed, and people are quar­
antined. 
The dozen Jewish people interviewed for this arti­
cle explained how they have adapted, resumed, and in 
some cases, coped without the rites of birth, life, and 
death that generations before them practiced accord­
ing to Jewish law. Seven of them referenced the specter 
of the Holocaust and enduring antisemitic hate in the 
United States and Europe as something that informs 
their understanding of the pandemic’s impact on the 
practice of Judaism.	


**Title: 1. Birth**
**Page number(s): 47-48**

Rachel Somerstein’s baby, Jonathan, had fallen 
asleep on the dining room table even before the brit 
milah began. His mother guessed that it was the sugar 
water-tylenol mixture that the mohel had given him, 
but newborns sleep a lot, and Jonathan was only ten 
days old. Soon, the circumcision ceremony would take 
place, welcoming him into the covenant of Abraham 
and to his family. It was the ideal situation: Emily Blake, 
his mohel, said with a laugh that her definition of a ‘per­
fect bris’ is one where the baby doesn’t cry but where 
the parents are moved to tears. 
Jonathan’s father nearly passed out as he observed the 
procedure. The mohel placed a Gomco clamp, shaped 
like a steel bell, on the baby’s penis. It would protect 
the head of the penis during the procedure and limit 
blood flow to a minimum. Blake took a scalpel and cut 
straight along the foreskin, easy and simple. It is a ritual 
of blood, one that Blake strives to make as painless as 
possible. 
Jonathan is an easygoing baby. It took him a few 
moments to cry when he was first delivered from the 
warm womb into a hospital room. Giving birth during 
a pandemic wasn’t easy, said his mother. The virus was 
ravaging her home state of New York and she worried 
that she may have to give birth alone. As Jonathan 
kicked inside her, more than 100,000 people around 
the country died from COVID-19. 	
But as soon as she found out she was having a boy, 
Somerstein knew she had to have a bris, a circumcision 
ceremony done according to Jewish law and with kava­
nah, which refers to a mindset of sincere intentionality 
that must accompany Jewish rituals. Although her hus­
band is not Jewish and has not yet converted, the cou­
ple keeps a kosher home, practices Shabbat, and says 
the Shema prayer with their daughter before she goes 
to sleep each night.
Somerstein had envisioned renting a place downtown 
in their small village of 14,000, nestled by the Shawan­
gunk Mountains in the Hudson Valley, and inviting all 
their siblings, parents, and close friends. But because of 
the pandemic, the guest list dwindled to just five: Jona­
than’s mom, dad, sister, and grandparents. 
“At one point I felt so sad about it,” she said while 
watching over her son and 4-year-old daughter. “It’s so 
sad that we couldn’t introduce our son to our families 
the way we wanted to.”
But having a brit milah was important to Somerstein. 
She wanted to give her son the freedom to decide how 
he wanted to practice Judaism when he grew older and 
this was a way to give him that agency, she said. Jewish 
men who do not have a bris done by a mohel with the 
proper blessings, in the proper time frame (not before—
and ideally on—the eighth day of life), or with the 
proper intention, must have a ritual drop of blood taken 
from their penis to make the circumcision “kosher,” as 
Blake calls it. 
The baby’s grandparents, father, older sister, and 
mother, said prayers over him. One of the blessings they 
recited was the birkat hagomel, spoken after someone 
has survived a dangerous journey—in this case, child­
birth. 
Four years earlier, Somerstein had survived a C-sec­
tion for her daughter without anaesthesia. This time, 
she had gone into prodromal labor five days days before 
Jonathan was born. She was dilating and having con­
tractions, her body was preparing for a baby that was 
coming but not ready yet. Jonathan was finally born at 
9:17pm on a Tuesday, with big cornflower blue eyes and 
pudgy legs. In early August, Jonathan was just over a 
month old, “figuring out who he is as he figures out the 
world around him,” says his mother.
During the bris, after they said the prayers, they 
gave Jonathan his Hebrew name—Yonatan. It was the 
name by which he would be called to the Torah, his 
covenantal name. On a laptop screen, Jonathan’s aunts, 
uncles, and grandparents said blessings. They each 
drank grape juice and wine, in lieu of a celebratory 
meal that could no longer be held in person.
Now that many brises have to be celebrated over 
Zoom, Emily Blake, Somerstein’s 64-year-old veteran 
mohel who has dedicated more than three decades of 
her life to this work, likes to begin the ceremony with a 
pun: they’re doing this “chai-tech” (“Chai” means life 
in hebrew).  
“We are accepting things we never thought we’d have 
to live with, in this pandemic,” said Blake on the phone 
one morning as she drove from New York to New Haven 
for a bris. “I think people are just so happy they’re get­
ting a joyous moment to celebrate, that there’s this new 
baby coming into their family. It’s a moment that you 
can step out of the incredible sadness of being stuck in 
lockdown, to have the sunshine break through that dark 
cloud.”

As a child growing up in the Jewish neighborhood of 
Borough Park in Brooklyn, New York during the 1950s 
and 60s, Esther Nash carried with her a message, forged 
by her parents’ experiences as Holocaust survivors, that 
the world is not a safe place. Her mother, Eva, had been 
plucked from her rural town in the Hasidic belt of Tran­
sylvania, Romania and deported to Auschwitz in the 
spring of 1944. She was trapped there when the camp 
was at capacity and eventually was moved to work as 
a slave laborer at a Krupps munitions plant where she 
worked on an assembly line making grenades. 
Eva would later tell her daughter about how on Yom 
Kippur, the Nazi guards in the concentration camp 
would deliberately offer more rations throughout the 
day of fasting, “to let the Jews know they no longer had a 
religion, no longer had a culture, no longer had a life,” 
said Nash. But Eva always fasted on Yom Kippur even

though she was near starvation. In the spring of 1945, 
the Russians liberated her and other Jewish prisoners. 
In 1948, Eva, then a 24-year-old Hasidic Jewish sur­
vivor of Auschwitz with shoulder-length dark hair and 
a shy smile, found herself in a displaced persons’ camp 
in Pocking, Germany. Her own parents had been gassed 
immediately on arrival in Auschwitz. 
At the displaced persons’ camp, she met a fair-haired 
young man named Chaya Rosenberg who was four 
years her senior. He was almost six foot one and Eva 
found him very good-looking. One Friday evening, she 
walked into his family’s room as they were preparing for 
the Sabbath. Years later, Eva told Esther that they were 
celebrating it in much the same way they did in her 
own home: a white tablecloth laid out, lighted candles, 
prayers recited. When Eva saw that Chaya had a home, 
parents, and a family, and were revelling in the “beauty 
of the sabbath,” she knew she wanted to marry this man. 
They got married during an “epidemic of marriages” 
in displaced persons’ camps all over Europe immedi­
ately after the war. Nash said that people were trying 
to recreate the family they had lost. Eva wore a white 
wedding dress with long peasant sleeves and deep skirt 
folds that were circulated among many brides in her 
displaced persons’ camp. The rings were second-hand. 
Chaya’s was engraved with somebody else’s name: 
Linda, inscribed with the date 07.01.37. 
Their wedding photo was taken in black-and-white in 
an area of the camp where weddings were held that the 
refugees called “Cafe Tel Aviv.” Fir trees decorated the 
backdrop. There was no bouquet, so Eva held potted 
flowers.
“My parents were traumatized people,” said Nash, as 
she looked at the photograph, now colorised and digi­
tized on her computer. “There was always the message 
that it was dangerous to be a Jew, but you should never, 
can never, give it up. It’s part of your identity and exis­
tence.”
Her parents arrived at Idlewild Airport (now John 
F. Kennedy Airport) in June 1949, carrying with them 
their Yiddish tongue, the trauma of the Holocaust, and 
their 3-month-old daughter Esther. Her father spoke 
no English. By then he had long been accustomed to 
working on the Sabbath because he had done so while 
working as slave labor in a special settlement near 
Novosibirsk, Siberia, and then on a kolkhoz in Tajiki­
stan during the war. When he arrived in New York, he 
continued to work on the Sabbath because he needed 
to make money. But every Sabbath, he would recite kid­
dush over challah and wine in a silver kiddush cup. On 
holidays and festivals he attended the synagogue across 
the street with his family.


For the first three years of her life, Nash only spoke 
Yiddish, the common language used at home with her 
Romanian mother and Polish father. Every Friday night, 
her mother would prepare a Sabbath meal—challah, 
gefilte fish, chicken noodle soup, roast chicken, and 
sometimes stuffed cabbage. Eva would light a cande­
labra with glowing Sabbath candles and recite bless­
ings. But there were many things her mother kept to 
herself—what happened in Auschwitz, what she had 
seen, what she had survived. “More was revealed in her 
inability to speak about it,” said Nash.


When the coronavirus began infecting scores of 
Americans and people worldwide earlier this year, Nash 
was not at all surprised, owing to her years of profes­
sional experience as a physician. But she had also grown 
up with the heavy lesson, first borne by her parents, that 
had prepared her for this.
“The pandemic showed that there was a chance the 
world could change in a heartbeat because it did for my 
parents,” she said one afternoon in July. “You wanted 
to know about how other such difficult times adapted 
Judaism—I would say it’s the reverse. Judaism allowed 
us to adapt to whatever times we found ourselves in 
because of the values, because of what it tells us about 
humanity, about people, about the tenuousness of life, 
and the important things.”


Three-year-old Ruthie Frosh loved to sit with her 
grandmother in the front row of the synagogue’s bal­
cony, overlooking the central nave, in Vienna’s sixth 
district. From that point, she could see everything—the 
beautiful neo-gothic architecture, the colorful stained 
glass windows, and the oil paintings in the interior. She 
could see the ark, the lectern and the Rabbi chanting 
from the Torah. On special Jewish holidays, her grand­
father would carry her in his arms downstairs and bring 
her to the Torah scroll. It is her first memory and the 
Eva (left), Charles (middle) and Sara (right), Eva’s sister, at 
the Pocking displaced persons camp in 1948.

one that she conjures today, as 89-year-old Ruth Weiner, 
and one that speaks to the strong sense of Jewish iden­
tity she had even at that young age.


She learned to read by age four, and by age five, she 
was reading the newspapers, finding out about “all kinds 
of stuff not appropriate to my age level.” When the 
Anchluss happened in 1938, she was seven years old. 
Germany and Austria had formed a union. Hitler and 
thousands of Nazis marched into Ruthie’s home city of 
Vienna and “the welcome could not have been more 
wholehearted or widespread or complete,” she said. 
Buildings were draped in red buntings with swastikas. 
In the streets, everybody was in uniform. 
“On that day I stopped being a child,” said Weiner. 
It became clear to her that to be Jewish meant you 
could be arrested or shot in the street for no reason, 
or made to scrub the sidewalks until your hands were 
bloody. She had to learn how to make herself invisi­
ble. 


One morning in first grade, a close friend came to 
school, looked at Ruthie, and spat on her. She said, 
“You’re a Jew. I didn’t know you were a Jew,” Weiner 
remembered. “That just slashed me to my core and 
made my new status very clear to me.”


In 1938, at first, young Jewish children could still 
attend public schools and receive Jewish religious 
education there. Ruthie learned Hebrew and prayers. 
Whenever Ruthie and her family went to the district’s 
elegant synagogue with its balcony and its bare-faced 
brick turrets, they were on guard. “There was a great 
sense of foreboding, you were prepared for something 
bad to happen at any point,” she said. Months later, 
during Kristallnacht, a brutal two-day pogrom target­
ing Jews, the Schmalzhoftempel synagogue would be 
burned to the ground.


Weiner explained that Judaism is a very portable 
religion, a characteristic that would become import­
ant later when she fled Vienna to England as a refugee 
child in the kindertransport, a rescue effort that trans­
ported 10,000 children from Nazi-occupied territories 
to safety just ahead of the war.
“Being Jewish goes beyond religious practice,” said 
Weiner. “Judaism is both a body of ceremonial practices, 
either in the home or in the synagogue, and equally a 
practice of everyday values, of how you see yourself in 
terms of what you expect of yourself, in terms of your 
own character, and more importantly how you interact 
with your community at large.”


On November 10, 1938, the day that would become 
known as Kristallnacht, Ruthie took two streetcars and 
walked four blocks to school in the Jewish quarter with 
her best friend, as she had done each day for months. 
Something was seriously wrong. Jews were huddled in 
streets filled with broken glass and crowds of people 
were throwing rocks. At 10 a.m., the teachers dismissed 
them out of a side door, ordering them to hold hands. If 
you see a group of more than two Nazis, cross the street, 
they told her. Stores were looted. Fires were burning in 
the street. That day, more than 91 Jews were murdered. 
All but one of Vienna’s synagogues were incinerated.


When Ruthie arrived home, her mother was waiting 
for her. By then, her father had been imprisoned for a 
month because of “political crimes.” A non-Jewish Nazi 
lawyer who was his father’s friend had protected him 
from being sent to a concentration camp.


Her mother rushed her into the house, past two 
Gestapo officers standing outside. Five minutes later, 
they heard an “unbelievable banging” on the door. 
Her mother made a motion for Ruthie to remain 
silent.	


For seven hours, they stayed seated in one spot, not 
making a sound, unable to eat or drink or use the bath­
room. Every half hour, the telephone would ring. Ruth­
ie’s mother was terrified, but remained silent: Was it a 
trick? Was it somebody in the family calling for help? 
She did not know what to do. 


By 9:30 p.m., the intervals between the pounding had 
grown longer. The phone rang and her mother finally 
picked up. The voice on the other end told her not to 
say a word. It told her to dress herself and the child. If 
she heard three taps on the door, it meant the gestapo 
had left and they could come out. It was the lawyer 
who had protected her father and was now rescuing 
them. That night, Ruthie shared a bed with the lawyer’s 
daughter, in his house.


Over the next few months, Ruthie’s mother worked 
on finding a way for them to gain entry into the United 
States. She managed to contact very distant family 
Ruth Frosh aged  seven and a half.

members—descendants of cousins of Ruthie’s grandfa­
ther—who lived in Texas. They banded together and 
issued an affidavit, promising to take on the responsi­
bility for financially supporting Ruth and her parents, 
should they come to the U.S.


Eighty-two years later, Weiner sat on an old sofa at 
her home in Bloomfield, Connecticut. At her age, she 
still has a twinkle in her eye and an exuberant energy 
in her voice. After all that she has witnessed, she said 
she still believes in God but that “I’m sometimes quite 
angry with him.” She has lived through periods of depri­
vation and rationing, learned how to make cake out of 
sweet potatoes for Shabbat when she had nothing else 
to use, and shared the last of her sugar with a neighbor 
because “that was just the thing to do.” In light of her 
experiences, she said that the inconvenience of the pan­
demic can be dealt with. “This is nothing compared to 
that.”


But she added, “I feel for people who are alone or 
are not in comfortable housing. I feel for the people 
who are experiencing illness or loss or deprivation, or 
who’ve lost their job.” She said that people reveal who 
they really are in times of crisis, pointing out that during 
the pandemic, some people truly rise to the occasion, 
such as her neighbors who offered to deliver groceries 
to her. Yet others refuse to wear masks, and some big 
businesses take advantage of  economic relief loans, yet 
fire their employees. 


“It is incumbent upon us to care for each other,” 
said Weiner. “This goes back to how the Jewish religion 
operates in times of crisis.” 


**Title: Death: Jewish Funeral Practices During the Pandemic**

3. Death
“Everything that is done in a Jewish funeral stems 
from the word respect,” said James Shure, a Jewish 
funeral director who works out of a Dixwell neighbor­
hood funeral home founded by his father. You do not let 
a person die alone. You light a candle near their head. 
In the pandemic, many family members could not enter 
hospitals to visit their Covid-infected family members, 
let alone sit by their side as they died. 


Each member of the chevra kadisha, translated ‘holy 
society’, looks more like a surgeon than practitioner 
of Jewish law when they enter the room at the George 
Street funeral home. They are volunteers who give their 
time and energy to do the tahara, or the sacred washing 
of a dead body, which is intended to return a person 
departing this world to the same pure, clean state they 
were in when they entered it as an infant. They wear 
face shields, masks, goggles, gowns and double-layered 
gloves. It is one of the greatest mitzvot, or good deeds, 
a Jew can perform. In the pandemic, the deed is even 
greater. 
“These people put themselves at risk without batting 
an eye,” said Shure.


After death, the body of a person who died from coro­
navirus might still be contagious, although scientific lit­
erature on post-mortem contagion is still nascent. Since 
the outbreak of the virus, the shomer, who watches over 
the dead body, has to stand at least 20 feet away from the 
body in Shure’s funeral home. 


As soon as the pandemic was declared, it took only 
two phone calls—one to California and one to New 
York—for Shure to determine how to carry out the 
tahara in a way that protects the people who are doing 
it while respecting the ritual and the dead person. The 
duration of the washing was halved. Instead of leaving 
an infected body on the washing table, they would be 
carried directly into the casket. But all the prayers are 
still said—prayers for forgiveness and prayers for eternal 
peace. 


Jewish burial law requires that the casket be lowered 
into the earth and covered with soil. They recite the 
Tziduk Hadin, a prayer, right after the grave is filled. 
They chant the El Malei Rachamim, asking for rest for 
the person’s soul. It is a moment of reckoning with the 
finality of death, Shure said. “It somewhat brings closure 
to the family to see the casket lowered and very often, 
that is when the family becomes rather emotional.” 
Now, safety regulations mandate that Covid patients 
have to be lowered prior to the family’s arrival at the 
cemetery. “It’s not cathartic,” Shure said. 


He has witnessed many funerals happen without 
those present being able to say the mourner’s kaddish, 
an Aramaic prayer that is often said at Jewish funerals. 
To recite the kaddish, a minyan must be formed, some­
thing not always possible with the Connecticut state 
rule allowing no more than ten people at a gravesite. 
“The kaddish does not mention death at all,” said 
Shure. “Rather, it installs and magnifies God’s name 
again as our world has fallen apart as we know it. We 
merely boldly, boldly, put our faith in God.”

“The repercussions of the disease did not stop at 
death. It absolutely affected, I think, the well-being of 
the mourner,” he said. “I do not believe to this day, and 
it’s sad, that [families] were able to at least begin their 
mourning in a meaningful way.”	

Yaron Lew has known Shure for 21 years but has 
never needed to use Shure’s funeral home until now. 
Lew does not believe in God. He doesn’t believe in the 
afterlife. His wife, Liora, believed in God. She grew up 
with a very orthodox Jewish grandfather and an observant mother who emerged from the Auschwitz death 
camp believing that her survival was due to divine intervention (her father, after surviving the Dachau concentration camp, became an atheist). Lew grew up on a 
secular kibbutz, a collective community, in Israel. 
Lew speaks with a commanding voice and laughs a 
lot, smile lines visible through his thin-framed glasses. 
Over the course of his 36-year relationship with Liora, 
he went from being a Jew who never went to synagogue 
to becoming the President of his local synagogue, 
BEKI. Lew met Liora underwater, beneath the Mediterranean shore, in an Israeli military submarine in the 
city of Haifa, where Lew was serving as a naval officer 
and where Liora had grown up.
Yaron Lew’s wife and his brother passed away within 
a week of each other in June this year. Lew was by his 
wife’s bedside when she passed, while his brother was 
in Israel. He had been sick for over two years; she had 
only been sick for two months. Neither of them passed 
from the coronavirus. He was buried according to Jewish law without a casket, so that his body may return to 
ash and dust in the earth. She was buried according to 
cemetery rules in a casket. Lew sat shiva, the seven days 
of mourning that commence upon burial, in his home, 
in person, to mourn his wife. He called his family on 
Zoom for a few hours a day as they sat shiva for his wife 
and then for his brother. 
The cemetery told him a maximum of 30 people 
could attend, so 30 people gathered at the gravesite for 
the burial. Everyone who attended had to wear a mask, 
and the funeral home tried to live stream the funeral 
for those who could not be present. But that sweltering 
day, with the temperature in the high-80s, the equipment overheated and the live stream failed. Each person donned a pair of latex gloves to pick up a shovel and 
scatter dirt onto the casket. The act is symbolic of saying 
goodbye, said Lew. 
At the shiva, Lew and his family used the outdoor 
deck and backyard of his Westville home to ensure the 
safety of the mourners. They didn’t kiss, they didn’t hug, 
they didn’t shake hands; he mourned within the constraints. Each day, more than the ten people required 
to have a minyan attended evening service so that they 
could say kaddish. They held a Zoom call for those who 
were unable or uncomfortable with travelling to Lew’s 
home for the shiva. Up to 50 people attended virtually, 
including his wife’s sister and Lew’s siblings, who live 
in Israel. 
He found himself on the opposite side of the screen 
when he sat shiva for his brother. He could not travel to 
Israel for his funeral and shiva. When I asked him how 
it felt, Lew paused for a long time and sighed. “Very 
distant. Very difficult,” he said. 	


In mid-June, when Liora was hospitalized for the 
final time, the doctors called Lew. During her previous hospitalizations, Lew and their children were not 
allowed to visit due to COVID-19 regulations. He snuck 
packages of letters and chocolates, cookies and flowers, 
in for her—“so at least she could have the smell and 
taste of home.”
“They said, ‘It’s good news and bad news. The good 
news is we are letting you and your daughters into the 
hospital, the bad news is we only let relatives of terminal 
patients go into the hospital,’” Lew recalled. She was 
moved into a hospice room a week later. “I spent the 
whole last night with her, and then she passed away in 
the morning,” he said, eyes sparkling with tears behind 
his glasses.	

I asked him what mourning means to him. “I talk 
about her a lot,” he said, smiling slightly. “I have pictures of her. I cry in the shower in the morning. I talk to 
her once in a while. I talk to friends about her. We talk 
with the girls about her, what she would think and what 
she would say. I’m not sure if that is remembering or if 
that is mourning.”

This April, two weeks before Liora was diagnosed 
with a rare and aggressive cancer, the Lew family celebrated the Passover Seder together. Instead of the usual

40 people gathered in a rented clubhouse, it was just 
Lew, Liora, and one of their daughters around the Seder 
table at home. Liora made chicken soup and butternut 
squash soup and brisket, Lew made gefilte fish (it was a 
three-day cooking event), and their friends delivered the 
sweet, sticky traditional Passover dish of haroset, homemade. The families were physically separated, but they 
were together––eating the same food, singing the same 
Passover songs, reciting the Haggadah. “Mah nishtanah, 
ha-laylah ha-zeh, mi-kol ha-leylot,” they sang. “Why is 
this night different from all the other nights?”

As a non-believer, Lew had always seen going to synagogue as a non-spiritual affair. But since the pandemic 
hit, Lew said he has started providing more spiritual 
support to the synagogue community. He writes to the 
congregation once a week. In those letters, he reminisces about returning to the kibbutz where he grew up, 
and how when he walks through the gates, he sings a 
song about how he is just a visitor in the landscape of 
his childhood. He writes about how he has felt a little like a visitor in the synagogue of late, and of how 
the pared-down Shabbat service in the parking lot was 
familiar. “It led me to reflect on the evolutionary road 
we travelled during these quarantine months,” he wrote 
in one letter. “We started to adapt and we reinvented 
ourselves.”

When Esther Nash’s father was on the frozen tundra 
in Siberia, freezing and close to death, he would pray 
to God that He should let him live. “I think he would 
have been very happy back then if he was told that he 
would live to ninety-two,” Nash told me on the phone 
on a sunny day in July. Both Eva and Shaya Rosenberg 
lived to be the same age. Until her last days in a nursing 
home, Eva always wore a gold Star of David, an engagement gift that Shaya had made by his brother-in-law.

Since the pandemic began, Nash has begun taking 
long walks through Woodbridge walking trails, and kayaking down the Housatonic River. “I think I’ve become 
more spiritual in some ways,” she said. “I’m in nature 
a lot more. I’m taking time to be in the moment a lot 
more. I’m trying to put this in perspective, thinking 
about life, and the frailty of life, and how things can 
change in a heartbeat.”
	
Rabbi Tilsen said that he’ll never know how 
different Jewish people are responding to the turmoil 
of the pandemic. Some people turn toward religion 
and God in times of crisis, others turn away. “Jewish 
theology is not doctrinal; so much theology is implicit. 
We don’t have a formal vision or idea of what God is,” 
said Tilsen. “Judaism has to do with the search for truth 
and it means rejecting ideas that are clearly falsifiable 
or clearly wrong. God often just comes from a sense of 
awe at the world.”

On the Fourth of July at noon, as Noam returned the 
Torah scroll to the ark, those present rose from their 
chairs and praised God a final time before the service 
closed. “The voice of Adonai stirs the wilderness. The 
voice of Adonai strips the forest bare…” they sang in 
Hebrew as one voice. Above them, thick foliage rustled 
and the sun stung their skin. 
In ones and twos, the faithful took their leave, stacking the chairs and tomes of scripture and prayer books 
onto the cart as they went. Nash’s low heels clicked on 
the baked tarmac as she walked away. The synagogue 
staff wheeled the trolley, heavy and laden with the Law, 
back into the cool sanctuary, where it would wait seven 
days until the next Sabbath.

**Title: DISPATCH FROM THE BOOK TRADER CAFE WRITER-IN-RESIDENCE**
**Author: ANANYA KUMAR-BANERJEE**
**Page number(s): 54**

At the beginning of shutdown, in early March, 
I used to venture out for long walks, bundled in 
my purple coat. The city was quiet and cold, my fingers losing feeling within fifteen minutes. In such 
weather, I longed for a cup of coffee to smooth over 
the day’s rough edges—my coffee shops of choice are 
Willoughby’s and the Book Trader Cafe.  I like to joke 
that I was the Book Trader writer-in-residence: until 
this past March I had finished every final paper underneath their hazy glass ceiling. But after spring break, 
Book Trader closed its doors. The rickety brown tables 
were upturned and placed on the counter. Willoughby’s window soon sported a hopeful sign, saying they 
would open someday soon. Both Blue State cafes 
featured a sign saying they were closed indefinitely. 
Koffee? looked abandoned, frozen in the days when 
we might brave the cold for a cigarette smoke. When 
Duda spoke about his employees, I thought briefly of 
the nice barista who used to joke with me about milk 
alternatives at the Book Trader counter. These people, like the Yale employees who brighten our day, are 
as much part of our college experience as the individuals we learn alongside.  

Some of the first coffee shops to return this summer were Koffee? and Willoughby’s Grove Street 
location, which both opened in July. Atticus, too, 
opened up its doors in late July, though the bookstore section is now separated by a pane of glass, and 
the seating area is blocked by shelves of sourdough 
and local craft beer. Blue State opened their York 
Street cafe on June 17th. Since students started 
arriving in New Haven, I’ve seen more people 
sitting inside, their masks off. There’s something 
strange about peering into the York Street Blue 
State. It’s a familiar sight, students with laptops 
open and black coffees in hand, but it looks off, foreign, a kind of looking-glass into the campus world 
we knew before. Absorbing the image of barefaced 
students indoors, it takes me a few moments to 
remember we’re in a pandemic, and then my mind 
reaches for anxiety: how can people be allowed to 
sit inside with their masks off? 

While Blue State on York may be stuck in a not-
so-distant past, other coffee shops have altered their 
expectations. Koffee’s Goodall says that “one thing 
that has really become clear in this pandemic is: innovate or die.” For Goodall, this has meant working with nearby buildings to secure outdoor space 
that fits tables that are at least six feet apart. For Willoughby’s, it meant closing down their York Street

branch until students returned in late August. “The 
store on York Street is highly dependent on Yale. It’s 
in the architecture library, which is closed. It’s in 
the midst of dormitories, which have been closed,” 
says Levine. Willoughby’s branch on Grove has a 
market including coffee-buyers across Connecticut, 
but its York Street location, like the Book Trader 
Cafe, still relies on Yalies for business. In the pan­
demic, Levine says, relying on this demographic “is 
just not a sustainable business model.” 


As we turn to the fall, many business owners find 
themselves at a loss. “It’s such a difficult time for 
anybody to know what to do,” says Willoughby’s 
Levine. Koffee?’s Goodall had considered invest­
ing in plexiglass to create little cubicles for Koffee? 
so that students could resume studying there the 
way they used to. But ultimately, it was much more 
expensive than Goodall anticipated. Unlike Book­
trader and Willoughby’s, Koffee’s Goodall has been 
exploring indoor options. “I’m hoping to open the 
doors for customers within the next month or so, 
before the weather turns,” says Levine. “But again, 
we’re only going to have seating for about 18 peo­
ple.” 


In college, students flesh out their niches with 
the coffee shops we frequent for hot beverages and 
studying. Memories form around seasonal drinks. 
Relationships flourish between us and the baris­
tas who witnessed us enter their coffee shops as 
first-years and walk out, into the world, as 23 and 
22-year-olds, a favorite cup of coffee in hand. It’s 
the fall of my senior year now, and the traditions 
I might’ve looked to––meeting friends to study in 
Book Trader, getting coffee and sitting outside of 
the Willoughby’s on York––seem like those of a far­
away place. In their place, I’ve had to make new 
traditions of my own, which has meant identifying 
roast names through conversations from 6 feet away 
at Willoughby’s, and finding out why some coffee 
demands heavy cream and others no dairy at all.


When I got back to New Haven after briefly vis­
iting family at the beginning of August, I saw that 
a friend who was passing through New Haven to 
collect their things had left me a gift: a small bag 
of Willoughby’s coffee. Anticipating a strange end­
ing to my time at Yale, they gave me some advice: 
“Drink lots of coffee – I finally bought you some 
from Willoughby’s.” My last first day of classes, I 
woke up early and made coffee in my kitchen. I 
pressed my nose into the still-fresh bag of coffee 
grounds, remembering briefly what it meant to be 
a first-year, so unsure of the world, standing outside 
the Willoughby’s on Grove street. It seems right to 
end this world where it began for me, with Wil­
loughby’s coffee. I make a note for myself: to buy 
intentionally from Willoughby’s and Book Trader. I 
know that if I want these local businesses to have a 
life of their own outside my sentiment, I have to act 
accordingly. It feels the most appropriate way to say 
goodbye: with a thank you.
