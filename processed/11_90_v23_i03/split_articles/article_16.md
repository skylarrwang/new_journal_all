Many anorexics and bulimics enroll in 
therapy programs or begin seeing private 
psychiatrists, although doctors stress that 
psychiatry is not the only prescription for 
health. "There are a million different ways 
to achieve salvation, and psychiatrists are 
not necessarily the only way," says UHS's 
Dr. Rasmussen. The problem, however, 
extends beyond the mental and emotional 
realm. Getting help for a student with an 
eating disorder can become a matter of life 
and death. Between five and fifteen percent 
of all anorexics die as a result of the 
disorder, and bulimics suffer from 
complications such as ruptured stomachs. 
At Yale, UHS can help only when a 
victim asks for it. "The bottom line is that if 
someone wants our help, they have to get 
here first," says Dr. Rasmussen. "There are 
some individuals out there that none of us 
are helping, because they don't get here. 
They either have to be willing to be helped 
or be in bad enough shape for me to declare 
them incompetent to care for themselves, 
and place them in a hospital." 

For the 
thousands of people suffering from eating 
disorders nationwide, the first step toward 
recovery is identifying the problem. 
"My weight goes between 110 and 
111 pounds," Janet says, though she 
does not look more than 100 pounds. 
She now weighs the same as her 
mother, whose extreme thinness she 
envies. 

Janet cups her face in her hands 
and slowly shakes her head. "It doesn't 
matter what the scale says," s he 
whispers.
