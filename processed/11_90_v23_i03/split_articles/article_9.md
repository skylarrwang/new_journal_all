Serena Spruill grew up in New Haven's 
Hill neighborhood, where she supports 
five children, one granddaughter, and 
one niece. Since 1979, she has belonged 
to the Inner City Co-op Farm, a four-
acre plot where local residents grow 
vegetables. The food Spruill takes home 
from the garden is an important part of 
her household's diet. "If I wasn't 
involved we would have no vegetables 
to eat because money is tight and has to 
be stretched as far as it will go," she 
said. "The garden helps out one hell of a 
lot." 

In 1978, a group of Hill neighbor-
hood residents who did not have their 
own backyards petitioned the state for 
temporary use of a vacant lot between 
Legion and North Frontage Avenues. 
The state approved and they founded 
the Co-op Farm the same year. The fed-
eral government put up several tho.u-
sand dollars to help the co-op get start-
ed. At first, the ground could not sup-
port vegetation, but after two years of 
composting, members harvested their 
first crop--3,800 pounds of vegetables. 
This year 75 families belong to the co-
op, and they share 50,000 pounds of 40 
different kinds of herbs and vegetables. 
A board of directors decides what to 
grow, and a full-time director manages 
the co-op's finances. 

The only requirements for mem-
bership in the co-op are residency in 
New Haven and two hours of work per 
week. The garden has no individual 
family plots, and because it is a non-
profit organization, members do not sell 
their produce to the public. Members 
divide the harvest among participating 
families, with larger families taking 
home greater shares. For families 
dependent on food stamps, the co-op 
provides an important dietary supple-
ment. 

But budget cuts and bureaucratic 
problems threaten the co-op's future. In 
the past few years the federal govern-
ment has cut funding for the program, 
forcing the garden to operate on a 
shoestring budget. Last year the co-op 
worked with a $12,500 budget, with 
only $4,500 coming from the govern-
ment, compared to $8,000 the previous 
year. As government funding dwindles, 
the co-op hopes foundations will take 
up the slack. But these foundations also 
operate on limited budgets. "So many 
different groups come in to the founda-
tions with proposals now that it's tough 
for them to meet everyone's needs," 
said Joe Moye, the co-op's director and 
longtime Hill resident. He spends 
much of his time tracking down grant 
money, and the amount of aid fluctu-
ates. 

In the meantime, the co-op has 
found creative and cheap ways to meet 
its basic needs. Leaves and manure for 
composting come from the Evergreen 
Cemetery and the Yale Polo Club, and 
local farmers donate seeds. But the 
board has other projects it wants to 
implement, including satellite gardens 
throughout New Haven, household 
composting of food waste and a senior 
citizen's program. Members also hope 
to expand their programs to include 
environmental education for children. 
The children currently farm one area of 
the garden, and the co-op wants to offer 
biology lessons and field trips. "But 
right now we have a small budget, so 
we just do what we can," said Sylvia 
Dorsey, who serves on the co-op's 
board of directors. 

Government bureaucracy poses 
another headache. The state legislature 
has twice shot down a bill proposing 
that the state transfer control of the lot 
to New Haven. So far, the measures 
have failed because city officials are 
divided over plans for land usage. 
Currently, merchants who want a high-
way leading downtown, housing advo-
cates and the Yale Medical School are 
vying for control of the land. "The high-
way option would knock the co-op 
out," said John McGuertey, executive 
director of the City Planning 
Commission. According to Jonathan 
Rosenthal, directorÂ· of Municipal 
Projects for the city, the co-op would 
not be compatible with housing or med-
ical school plans either. 

The co-op sits on the largest unde-
veloped tract in New Haven, a valuable 
plot of land originally intended for 
highway construction. The co-op has 
only temporary use of the property, but 
any time plans for development arise, 
Rosenthal's department receives a rash 
of protest letters. Co-op members have 
also built a fence around their garden to 
reduce theft, and Rosenthal sees this as 
a move to mark the land as their own. 
"The co-op members are a very crafty 
bunch of individuals," he said. He con-
siders their desire to stay on the land 
unrealistic. "They are expecting a large 
subsidy if they expect the state to give 
them title. It's like the difference 
between letting relatives stay for the 
night in your spare bedroom and asking 
them to move in." 

Moye would like the state to reco-
mmend that the co-op remain 
untouched, or that the state sell the land 
to the co-op for a reduced price. "The 
entire empty lot stretches over 26 acres, 
so there's no reason why they couldn't 
make changes and leave us our share," 
he said. Rosenthal defines the problem 
in utilitarian terms. "The question is 
whether, in such a densely populated 
city, the co-op is the best use of the land 
for the most people," he said. 

Moye believes the co-op is the best 
use of the land because it is so impor-
tant to member families. "The members 
share the common denominator of 
poverty. The food they bring home is 
proof that together they can do some-
thing about that," he said. "If the city 
sees that the community is organized to 
support their garden, they'll think twice 
about taking the land away."
