Letters 
To the Editor: 
I recently had an opportunity to read 
Emily Bazelon's article, "Making the 
Mosaic: Non-Traditional Casting at the 
Dramat," and felt a strong need to com-
ment. 
I graduated from the Yale School 
of Drama's Theater Administration pro-
gram in 1978. Since then I have experi-
enced non-traditional casting in a few 
different arenas, such as the Milwaukee 
Repertory Theatre, the Theatre Panel of 
the Ohio Arts Council, and the D.C. 
Commission 
on 
the 
Arts 
and 
Humanities. 
Recently, I assumed a new posi-
tion at the Yale School of Drama and the 
Yale Repertory Theater as Minority 
Recruitment Officer and Associate 
Director of Community Affairs. 
Returning to Yale after twelve years, I 
became increasingly dismayed as I read 
about the non-traditional casting prac-
tices at the Yale Dramat in The New 
Journal. I suppose I always labored 
under the illusion tha~ Yale would be at 
the vanguard of change. It also seems to 
me that non-traditional casting policies 
would be instituted much more easily 
by a student theater organization than 
by a professional regional company. 
Perhaps David DeRose, Director of 
Undergraduate Theater Studies, and the 
Dramat should do a little research. Nqn- . 
traditional casting is not new, and our 
audiences are more intelligent than we 
think. To Tara Murphy's uninformed 
statement that "No one can answer how 
to c.ast people of color in a play that is 
historically white," I can only respond 
that regional Â·theaters have been provid-
ing the answers (in one form or another) 
for over ten years. Furthermore, I 
believe the Yale Dramat should serious-
ly evaluate its own actions. To suggest 
that ethnic theater groups may segre-
gate the Yale theater community is 
patently absurd when, by their own 
records, since "the fall of 1988 ... only 
eight people of color performed in six 
mainstage shows." 
I am not suggesting that the casting 
situation is ideal. Theaters in this coun-
try certainly have a long way to go 
before the practice becomes routine. 
And though there are still issues to be 
resolved, organizations like the Non-
Traditional Casting Project as well as 
individuals are working hard to achieve 
a better understanding. 
Sincerely, 
H. Asante Scott
