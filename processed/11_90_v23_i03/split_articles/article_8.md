Yale's Reading 
Machine 
For blind students at Yale, looking up a 
quotation in a textbook can take hours. 
Instead of flipping pages, they must fast 
forward and rewind through cassette 
recordings of the books. "You've got 40 
or SO cassettes to deal with every 
semester," said Matt Weed (SM '93). 
"They're a huge waste of time." Until 
now, Weed has depended on cassettes 
to complete his reading assignments. 
The Resource Office, which aids dis-
abled students, employs ten people to 
record class assignments onto the tapes. 
These readers log up to 200 hours of text 
per blind student each semester. 

Two Yale undergraduates have 
invented a vocalized text scanning sys-
tem which could make readers and cas-
settes obsolete. Located in Cross 
Campus Library's basement, the system 
is the brainchild of Weed and comput-
ing assistant Victor Grigorieff (SM '92). 
When the two met in October 1989, 
Weed showed Grigorieff a program 
called "Outspoken," which uses speech 
to explain Macintosh graphics. As the 
cursor lands on words such as "File, 
Edit, Format,"a voice pronounces the 
words aloud. The students realized that 
if a program could vocalize commands, 
it could also lend voice to other printed 
words. 

Last spring Weed and Grigorieff 
asked the Provost's Office for funds to 
create the text scanning system. "We 
had to get promises from <!"omputer 
companies that the scanner would work 
in order to justify a $1S,OOO system," 
said Grigorieff. The Provost's Office 
approved the project in May, and Weed 
and Grigorieff began to assemble the 
system. 

"Theoretically the system is not 
very complicated," said Grigorieff. The 
system hooks up a Hewlett-Packard text 
scanner to a Macintosh FX II. The scan-
ner, which looks and works like a small, 
personal Xerox machine, photographs a 
page of text and, in about 20 seconds, 
transfers it to the computer screen. 
Students with limited vision can enlarge 
the text and read it on the FX II's 19-inch 
screen, or like blind students, simply 
command the computer to read the text 
aloud. They can also copy the material 
onto a floppy disk and listen to it later 
in their rooms. The typical Macintosh 
computer can read the copied text 
aloud. 

The scanning system has a number 
of advantages over cassettes. Instead of 
fast forwarding, students command the 
computer to read text aloud from any-
where in the document simply by hit-
ting a search key. A floppy disk, which 
holds 600 pages of text, also takes up 
less space than cassettes. ''When I have 
SO tapes lying around, it's not easy to 
pack them up," said Weed. "It's much 
easier to throw all my books on a hard 
disk." Weed can also make notes in the 
margins of his books. "I type my notes 
into the text in italics. When I want them 
read to me, I tell the machine to search 
for everything italicized." 

Still, the scanner can neither 
describe graphs nor transcribe hand-
written texts like human readers can. 
But Weed believes the scanner will 
replace readers. "As better software 
comes out, it is our determination to 
eliminate the need for readers at Yale," 
he said. 

Resource Office Director Fay 
Hanson believes the system will benefit 
not only blind students but others as 
well. Dyslexics, for example, could prof-
it from learning new material through 
more than one mode--aural as well as 
visual. 

The Resource Office plans to hire a 
computing coordinator, who will pro-
vide technical assistance and train peo-
ple to use the system. Grigorieff esti-
mates that it would take a blind person 
with no computer experience 40 hours 
to learn how to scan text. Weed, who 
had extensive experience using a 
Macintosh, learned in about 20 hours. 
"The system saves me time and allows 
me to perform more like an average stu-
dent/' he said. He and Grigorieff are not 
currently seeking a patent for their 
invention, and said they would share it 
with other schools if asked. "As far as 
we know, this machine is the first of its 
kind," said Grigorieff. Visually disabled 
students will be able to use the text scan-
ner early next year.
