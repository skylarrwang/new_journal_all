Saying No to Hate 
Jennifer Pitts 
On October 30, vandals spray painted swastikas and Nazi 
slogans on the walls of Congregation Kol Havarim, a 
synagogue in Glastonbury. Halfway across Connecticut, 
members of Congregation Sinai in West Haven finally have 
reopened their synagogue after a fire destroyed the building 
two years ago. Police suspect that arsonists started the fire, 
which caused $750,000 in damage and destroyed classrooms, 
offices and a chapel, as well as irreplaceable books and 
records. "It was a very demoralizing experience," said 
Theodore Shapiro, president of the congregation. "Arson of 
your house would be bad. But it hurts even more when it is 
done against a synagogue, which is considered everybody's 
haven. We went through a period of shock." Although the 
police never found any suspects, the Anti-Defamation League 
of B'nai B'rith, a Jewish civil rights organization, suggests that 
religious hatred might have motivated the arsonists. 

The anti-Semitic graffiti and torched synagogue are just 
two of a rash of recent crimes motivated by religious, racial, 
and other prejudicial hatred in Connecticut. In a particularly 
horrid incident, two Hartford high school students brutally 
beat and killed a gay man, Richard Reihl, in 1988. The 
students, who gagged their victim with duct tape and 
bludgeoned him to death with a log, later confessed they 
killed Reihl because of his sexual orientation. Not all 
incidents, however, are so explicitly violent, or even 
uncontestably criminal-as the Yale campus learned this past 
September, when an anonymous group left racist letters in the 
mailboxes of ten African-American law students. 

Hoping to curb pr;judice-based violence, the 
Connecticut legislature enacted a hate crimes law on October 
1. Under the new law, if a prosecutor can prove that bias 
against a victim's race, religion, ethnicity or sexual orientation 
motivated a criminal act, judges can reclassify the crime and 
mandate a harsher sentence. Previously, the courts treated a 
crime such as desecration of religious property as vandalism, 
a misdemeanor punishable by less than a year in prison. 
Under the new law, bias-related vandalism will be a felony, 
and criminals can serve up to five years in jail. Similarly, 
courts will impose stiffer penalties for other hate crimes. "The 
law shows a sensitivity to the kind of non- physical damage 
that hate crimes cause," said Robert Leikind, Executive 
Director of the Anti-Defamation League. "It tells people this 
is a serious crime now." 

State Assemblyman Miles Rapoport (0-West Hartford) 
maintains that the stricter punishments will deter potential 
November 30, 1990 
offenders. "Most hate crimes are deliberately committed-not 
spontaneous outbursts, like crimes of passion," he said. 
"With deliberate crimes people are most likely to weigh out 
the threat of stiffer penalty." 

Still, offenders can avoid the harsher penalties if local 
investigators do not recognize the signs of hate crimes. "The 
success of the law hinges on two questions," said Leikind. 
"One, are the local police aware of the laws? Two, how well 
trained are they in determining whether a crime is motivated 
by bias?" New Haven's police force has an edge over many 
local police departments because some of its officers have 
undergone training about hate crimes, rapes, and domestic 
violence. "There are no state guidelines," said Sergeant Carol 
Marci, head of the New Haven Police Department's Sex and 
Hate Crimes Task Force. "Officers learn to ask the right 
questions-to investigate with a more sensitive eye." 

Community cooperation, however, must supplement 
this heightened sensitivity. Law enforcement efforts are often 
undermined by resistance from victims. "The average citizen 
hates cops," said a co-founder of the New Haven Anti-
Violence Project (A VP), who asked to remain unnamed. "I'm 
hoping that this new law will increase communication with 
the police." After two gay men were assaulted outside the 
Copa Cabana, a New Haven nightclub catering to a gay 
clientele, local residents founded A VP to work with police 
and get the word out on the hate crimes law. The A VP meets 
with Sergeant Marci each month to maintain communication 
between the police and the gay community. The group also 
posts fliers in New Haven's gay nightclubs, urging victims to 
report incidents to the police. "The vast majority of gay-
related hate crimes go unreported," said Robert Bray of the 
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. "Gays are afraid to 
come out of the closet to the police." 

College students and university officials, on the other 
hand, have fewer reservations about reporting hate crimes to 
the police. One third of the crimes reported in Connecticut 
over the past two years occurred at colleges and universities. 
The New Haven area-including Yale and Southern 
Connecticut State University-sustained twelve hate crimes. 
The University of Connecticut recorded fifteen, at least twice 
as many as reported by any other community in the state. 

Law enforcement officials speculate that certain aspects of 
college life contribute to the higher rate of reported hate 
crimes. "The mixture of different types of people on a 
university campus is part of it. In normal society,
