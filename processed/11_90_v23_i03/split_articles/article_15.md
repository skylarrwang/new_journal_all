By November of her first year at Yale, Janet had lost control. 
''I purged after every meal," Janet, now a senior, recalls. 
"Breakfast I'd throw up. Lunch I'd throw up. Dinner I'd throw 
up. Afterwards, I'd think, 'Great, I got rid of that bloated 
feeling,' and then I'd be able to re-focus and do work, be 
productive. But a few hours later, I'd do it all over again." 
Janet is not alone. Each day, dozens of Yale students, suffering from 
an eating disorder knoum as bulimia, overeat and force themselves to 
vomit. Others, suffering from anorexia, rt!fuse to eat and exercise 
compulsively. Dr. Jane Rasmussen, Chief of Undergraduate 
Medicine at l!nive.rs.ity Health Services (UHS), estimates that 
between 15 and 25 percent of all students at Yale have problems with 
eating, exer_cise and body image. While some students arrive at Yale 
with a history of eating problems, others find that the sudden 
freedom and new responsibilities of the college environment push 
them into the cycle of an eating disorder. Here, three women tell 
their stories. 
"At home, my mother, who is very weight-conscious and 
so tiny-about 110 pounds-would always watch exactly 
what we ate at meals," Janet says. "My brother would just 
ignore her and eat what he wanted, and he was fine. But I 
would remember what she said~ and feel like she was trying to 
deprive me of something that I should be able to have. Even 
when she wasn't there, I'd feel guilty that I wasn't good like 
her. When I came to Yale, and she wasn't watching me closely 
anymore, I just kept eating and eating. I knew that I was 
being bad, and that I would gain weight unless I got it under 
control, and that's when I started throwing up. I remember 
hearing about bulimia in high school, and thinking 'How 
could anyone do anything so gross?' But when I got here, I 
started to think 'What a cool idea, what a great way to eat all 
you want, and not gain weight.' 
''There was always so much in the dining hall, so much 
to eat," Janet says. "I didn't even enjoy or want most of it. 
Compared to food at home, it was so greasy and fatty. I'd be 
starving and would put two bites of food into my mouth and 
feel full, but I'd keep eating and eating and after about thirty 
minutes I'd say to myself, 'Why are you doing this? You were 
full half an hour ago.' But I still couldn't stop. I never did. I'd 
eat until I was sick, and then I'd have to throw up to feel 
better. 
''When I met my boyfriend, I knew inside that he would 
be my means of getting help. I knew he would understand, 
and so I didn't try to hide my throwing up from him. And he 
would get so upset, but not like my brother did; my brother 
would see me throwing up at home and would say, 'You are 


so gross' and would leave me alone. But my boyfriend would 
look like he was about to cry. He was really sad. With him, it 
was different than with my friends. They'd say, 'Oh, that's 
really bad, don't do it.' But with my boyfriend, I could see 
that I was really affecting him, that I was hurting him. It was 
deeper. Even though I still am fat, I want to stop. 
"You don't see me without clothes," says Janet, leaning 
her thin arms on the table. "I'm disgusting. My stomach is 
just huge, and my arms are getting bigger. The other 
morning, I woke up and saw how big my legs were, and it 
made me sick. I tell my boyfriend all the time, 'Look at this 
stomach! Doesn't this make you sick?' He tells me that I'm 
nice and soft. But I don't want to be nice and soft; I want to be 
tough and mean and muscular." 


Like Janet, Andrea felt overwhelmed by food. At every meal in the 
dining hall, she obsessively watched her peers' eating habits, 
comparing her eating behavior with theirs. What no one saw, 
however, was what happened to Andrea at night, when she was 
alone. After her roommates set off for the libraries, Andrea would 
mull over what she did not allow herself to eat during the day's 
meals. As she grew angrier and angrier over how she had deprived 
herself, anxiety would build and soon Andrea found herself gorging 
on junk food. By the end of her sophomore year, Andrea would binge 
up to three times a day. She managed to attend most classes, but 
completed little, if any, reading; she was passing through Yale on a 
bare minimum of work. She devoted most of her energy to hiding her 
binges from her roommates. 
'1 was always very careful with what I ate in my dining 
hall," Andrea, a junior and recovering bulimic, says. "I felt 
that people were watd\ing what I put on my tray as carefully 
as I watched what they put on theirs. 
My roommates last 
year were always amazed at how I could remember exactly 
what they had had for lunch or dinner the day before, right 
down to what they left on their plates. They thought it was 
very funny and cute, my schtik. They had no idea that they 
were setting boundaries for me. In the dining hall, I'd never 
take or eat more than the person I was eating with. They were 
my control, like in an experiment." She shakes her head and 
smiles. "When my roommate would go and get some ice 
cream or pie, I'd think, 'Now I can have some, too. And if 
anyone calls me a pig for eating it, I can just say that she's 
eating it, too, so leave me alone!' 
"When I'd binge, I was always in a complete panic. I'd 
worry about how horrible I'd look that summer in a bathing 
SUit. I'd think about how my mother would say that I'd gained


weight. I'd panic that I would bump 
into someone I knew while carrying a 
pizza or bags of cookies. 'What will I 
say if I see someone?' I'd think, and 
make up these ridiculous lies about a 
friend in another college who was sick 
and had missed dinner, or say that I 
was having people over. I'd spend so 
much energy plotting these lies, just like 
in the dining hall, where I'd be ready.to 
point the finger at my room mate if 
anyone were to question the ice cream 
on my tray. 
"I thought that everything was just 
fine, and that no one had any idea," 
Andrea says, looking away. "But one of 
my roommates had been clued in for a 
while, and she watched me. She 
became suspicious that something was 
strange after she noticed that I was 
never in the room at night, even when I 
claimed to be and was actually out on a 
binge, and that I always disappeared 
after meals. She purposely came home 
early one night and heard me throwing 
up in the shower. 
When she 
approached me I tried to be laid back 
about it, and lied that I'd felt sick all 
day. But the next night she caught me 
throwing up again, and this time there 
were bags and wrappers all over the 
room, so I didn't even bother denying it. 
She looked at me like I was some kind 
of a monster, and I remember thinking, 
'Oh, just give me a break. What are you 
looking at?' 
"But when I stood up and went to 
the sink to rinse my mouth, I saw 
myself in the mirror and was shocked. 
My eyes were bloodshot and swollen 
and tearing, my whole face was red, 
there was mucus falling from my mouth 
and my hand. All I could think was 
that I looked like someone had been 
beating me. I looked like one of those 
women from the domestic violence 
commercials. And when I got back to 
our room, my roommate was already on 
the phone with my mother." 


While Janet and Andrea could not restrain 
their eating habits, Melissa maintained too 
much control. She could go for days eating 
next to nothing and exercised to the point of 
exhaustion. 
Her weight plummeted 
dangerously low, and still she wouldn't eat. 
Not until she could barely function did 
Melissa realize she might have an eating 
disorder. In the spring of her first year at 
Yale, Melissa sought professional help. 
"I was literally never in the dining 
halls. I would find any excuse possible 
not to be there," Melissa remembers. 
"Lunch with a professor, working late, 
not feeling well. I'd say anything to my 
roommates, and then spend the time 
running or doing -aerobics. I wouldn't 
even get close to the dining hall if I · 
could help it. I could live on almost 
nothing. An apple, a salad, that's all I 
would let myself eat for days. 
I 
remember standing up and feeling so 
light-headed and weak, and thinking, 
'Good, I'm losing weight. This is really 
working.' That was when I was about 
90 pounds, and I'm 5'7". 
"No matter how tired or shaky I 
felt physically, with every missed meal 
and every mile run, I would almost get 
a high. I thought I was so much better 
than every person walking into that 
dining hall. Everyone else was so 
undisciplined, in my opinion, and I was 
strong. 
"When I hit 90 pounds, though, I 
could barely funotion. Even walking 
was extremely difficult. That's when I 
acknowleged that all of this was not as 
much fun or as innocent as when I was 
little and would purposely d rive my 
mother crazy by·refusing to eat. This 
had definitely gotten beyond that. And
