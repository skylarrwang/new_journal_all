China seemed rather inhospitable to 
Christmas. The seasonal trappings that 
had made their way there came without 
any familiar meaning or associations: in 
China, "Jingle Bells" is as likely to pl~y 
over the public address system in an 
unbearably hot train car in mid-July as 
in a department store in December.


My Yale-China colleagues seemed 
to share my apprehensions. 
A 
celebration together would have been 
too crowded with each of our personal 
ghosts of Christmas Past. And with six 
more months to live together in 
extremely close quar ters ("in one 
another;s soup," as one of my co-
workers put it) and to rely on one 
another for support, we didn't want to 
risk an unhappy Christmas together.


We even declined an invitation for 
Christm as dinner with Dr . i..iu, a 
wonderful man of seventy-something 
who had attended Yale-China schools 
since high school, and who, every few 
weeks, cooked us the best Chinese food 
we'd ever eaten.


The absence of the h oliday 
commercialism we had all railed against 
in the U.S aggravated our damp ened 
enthusiasm. Without it, getting into the 
holiday spirit was even harder than it 
had been at Yale. No TV specials. No 
reminders of how few shopping days 
were left. It couldn't really be the 
season to be jolly.


But 
our 
calendars 
read 
"December," 
and 
we 
teacher-
ambassadors of American culture felt 
obligated to display at least some 
Christmas cheer and trimmings for our 
students' sake. This was, after all, the 
first chance for most of them to see how 
Americans celebrated this holiday they 
had heard so much about, the closest 
thing we seemed to have to their Lunar 
New Year.


So we hung some leftover 
decorations-a printed wreath, an 
advent calendar, last year's Christmas 
cards, and so on-in our office. We 
found a nursery, bought a fir tree, and 
took it home-by bike, of course. We 
had no ornaments and put little 
creativity into improvising, but the tree 
still made the holiday seem more real. 
And it certainly intrigued our students.


None of us realized at first just how 
intrigued they were. I had spent a lot of 
time that term with a class of 25 doctors 
and research scientists w h o were 
improving their English before going 
abroad to study with the World Health 
Organization. Friendly and eager to 
learn, they worked well together, and I 
enjoyed being with them.


And they, it turned out, enjoyed 
the idea of Christmas. Most of them, 
aged 25 to 45, were spending the 
semester away from their families and 
homes just as we were. Perhaps they 
were lonely and bored, maybe just 
curious. Perhaps they realized that as 
English students they 
had an 
unimpeachably legitimate excuse to _ 
have a ball celebrating a Western 
holiday-an otherwise politically 
questionable act. Whatever the reason, 
they were determined to celebrate their 
first Noel in style.


Foregoing the expense of a tree, 
they gathered construction paper, 
aluminum foil, streamers, and cotton 
balls, and decorated an entire classroom 
wall with a Christmas scene, complete 
with snowman and tree. They insisted 
on learning Christmas 5ongs, so the best 
singer among us repeated many rounds 
of "Deck the Halls" and other favorites.


As the day approached, the 
students' enthusiasm grew like that of 
children, even without the promise of 
Santa Claus or presents. Some planned 
to attend services at one of Changsha's 
two Christian churches, but I declined 
the invitation to accompany them. A 
Yale-China teacher who had gone the 
year before found so many curious 
observers that the Chinese Christians 
could barely even hear the ceremony-
Never having been to a church in the 
U.S. on Christmas, I wouldn't have felt 
right joining the curious in China, 
though I was indeed curious to see how 
the few Chinese who celebrated the 
holiday did so.


Instead, I joined my students in 
well-remembered American holiday 
rituals transformed by Chinese culture_ 
I did not spend the last hour of class on 
December 23 standing at the board 
talking about restrictive and non-
restrictive clauses, but rather sat 
perched on the front of my desk reading 
A Charlie Brown Christmas and The 
Grinch Who Stole Christmas aloud to a 
roomful of doctors. Ordinarily too 
afraid of losing face to show any 
interest in a children's book, they 
crowded around eager to understand 
the English and, even more importantly, 
to see the pictures. By the end of The 
Grinch, it was beginning to feel a little 
like Christmas.


The familiar and the bizarre 
converged again when we went 
caroling on Christmas Eve. The accents 
were certainly different than when I 
went caroling in sixth grade, and most 
of the singers had some trouble 
remembering the words (especially 
beyond the fifth day of Christmas), but 
the songs were the same, as was the 
whole idea of sharing the holiday with 
our neighbors.


Our neighbors, of course, had no 
idea why this odd group of Chinese and 
Americans was wandering around 
campus in the cold of night singing off-
key in a foreign tongue. But many 
appreciated it. A chemistry teacher 
who had often helped the Yale-China 
teachers stood with her ailing husband 
at their fourth floor window smiling 
and listening. For the undergraduates, 
we broke the monotony of another 
evening studying in cold, unheated 
lecture halls. The library wasn't open in 
the evening, and their dorm rooms 
could not comfortably hold all eight 
residents studying at the same time_ 
They packed the balconies at the front 
of the main classroom building to watch 
and some even deduced that our 
performance had something to do with 
Christinas_


On December 25 the incongruity of 
Christmas in China hit with full force_ 
Although we officially had the day off, I 
taught four hours of make-up classes so 
my students could take New Year's Day 
off. (To the university's administrators, 
'holiday' meant moving work hours to 
another time, not canceling them 
entirely.) Riding across campus to class, 
I was struck as I had been a year before 
by the utterly disconcerting fact that 
this was, for everyone around me, a 
perfectly ordinary day. The absence of 
the Christmas morning hush that quiets 
entire streets, entire neighborhoods and 
entire cities made the noise of everyone 
going about their daily routines seem 
much louder than usual_


We teachers did spend time with 
our own ghosts that day, but we also 
celebrated together. Having turned 
down Dr. Liu's dinner invitation, we 
made spaghetti with pesto_ Not exactly 
a traditional Christmas meal, but distant 
enough from our daily Chinese fare to 
seem celebratory.


We celebrated with our students, 
too. My students had a party, and I 
spent the evening trying to learn to two-
step under the tutelage of a patient 
young pharmacologist from Kunming_ 
I had no more success learning the steps 
than my students on the sidelines had 
concealing their laughter a t my 
awkwardness on the dance floor.


Eventually the party, and our 
Christmas, ended. But at least it had 
happened. Being in China hadn't kept 
Christmas from coming. It came. 
Somehow or other, it came just the 
same.


I may neve;,celebrate an odder 
Christmas, and I cannot recall whether. 
or not I enjoyed it at the time. (I know I 
have repressed the darker side: cold, 
grime, depression, no hot water) But 1 
expect that this year, when I look at my 
tree decorated with Chinese baubles 
and trinkets, the only ghosts of 
Christmas Past whom I expect will 
come to call are my students, thrilled at 
celebrating their first Christmas, and 
my colleagues and I, unexpected ly 
getting caught up in their excitement. 
And I hope that at some point on 
December 25 at least a few doctors in 
Changsha and Chengdu and Wuhan 
realize that it's Christmas again.
