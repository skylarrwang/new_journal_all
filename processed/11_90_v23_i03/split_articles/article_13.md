Using information collected both at 
night and during the day, Pastore hopes

Haven-the La Cosa Nostra crime 
'rg;ilniLzoGuon and a number of drug-
street gangs. "We want to make 
pificant arrests," he said.

places. 

Pastore's approach to the war on 
drugs differs from the strategy of most 
IU~"~;>U<:e chiefs around the country. "I'm a 
strong proponent of decriminalization," 
Pastore said. "Drug trafficking has 


already been de facto decriminaliZed. 
The courts artd jails are overwhelmed." 

Pastore prefers medical rather than 
punitive solutions to the dru8 problem; 
he wants to use police officers to get 
drug abusers into treatiMnt rather than 
jail cells. 

Other police chiefs in Conaecticut 
are not convinced. They atpe that to 
stop drugs, officers have to get tough 
with drug dealers. DanbUry Chief 
Nelson Macedo thJnb dealers should be 
put to death. He argues that Mao 
Zedong smothered nan:olk ue in China 
by killing all of the dflllen. OIMr ~ 
chiefs question whether treatment will 
be effective. Chief Dennis An.lano of 
Madison argues that people only get 
treatment because courts force them and 
that they start doing druss apia\ wheJil 
treatment ends. 

Wallinglord Chief 
Dortenzio worries that decriminaliza-
tion would send the wrong message. ~ 
questions the logic of trying to educate 
kids about the dangers of drugs while 
making drug laws more lenient. 

"Education is a much better response 
than decriminalization," he said. 

For Pastore, drug ~ucation and 
decriminalization are part of the same 
Jennifer Pitts/The New Journal 
effort to shrink the demand for drugs. 
Whether getting addicts into treatment 
or warning kids about the dangers of 
crack, the police, Pastore says, must find 
aew ways to fight the war on drugs. 

Well-informed officers are crucial to 
Pastore's approach. "Our officers need 
to know more than how to spell the 
word 'drugs,"" he seid. "They must 
bow where the drugs are, what kind of 
beluwior they induce, why people do 
ttaem.• 

By Pastore's admission, changing 
the New Haven police is a big task. The 
obstacles that confront him seem daunt-
ing: New Haven has no money, New 
England is economically depressed, and 
1990 will go down as the most crime-
ridden year in American history. Still, 
the chief asserts that his tenure of office 
has only just begun. "I've been gestat-
ing for the past nine months. Now 
I'm ready to be born."
