Christmas comes much too close for 
comfort to the end of the Yale term. For 
four years, papers and exams made me 
resent Christmas for interfering with my 
academic life, and I resented Yale for 
making me resent Christmas. It would 
have taken a visit from Scrooge's ghosts 
to keep the reality of Christinas Present 
from turning me into a Grinch. 

I enjoyed my first post-Yale 
Christmas, teaching in China for the 
Yale-China Association, little more than 
the previous four. I had enough time to 
celebrate but no one to celebrate with. 
As the only American at my school, I 
found myself culturally alone in a land 
of a billion people. I threw a Christmas 
party for my students, but the culture 
shock of my first four months had kept 
us from getting to know each other well 
enough to celebrate with much 
enthusiasm. 

By the next year, I could have 
hoped for a more pleasant Christmas. 
Having already spent one holiday in 
China, I knew what to expect. And 
I did not spend the 
last hour of class on 
December 23 talking 
about restrictive and 
non-restrictive 
clauses, but rather 
read aloud A Charlie 
Brown Christmas and 
The Grinch Who Stole 
Christmas. 

having transferred to another school, I 
worked with other Yale-China teachers 
and felt more at home. 

In fact, we had recently celebrated 
Thanksgiving quite successfully, which 
boded well for a festive Christmas. The 
dinner, though two days late since 
Thanksgiving is not a Chinese school 
holiday, had been as authentic as we 
could manage. Chicken and duck 
substituted for unavailable turkey, but 
we had everything else: dressing, yarns 
with marshmallows, mashed potatoes, 
wild rice, noodles, homemade rolls, and 
two pumpkin pies, one courtesy of 
ingenuity and a fresh local pumpkin 
and the other thanks to a mother's 
willingness to spend $25 to airmail $1.50 
worth of canned pumpkin and 
condensed milk to China. 

Still, the approach of Christmas 
worried me. Not only had I celebrated 
21 of the previous 22 holidays with 
parents and grandparents, but also
