Editor•s Note 
As we put the final touches on the last issue of the year, we 
are making plans for 1991. Last year at this time, we were 
sifting through papers in Sterling Library's archives, con-
tacting alumni, and talking with professors who remem-
bered the 1970 May Day demonstrations at Yale. In a theme 
issue that came out last February, The New Journal focused 
on events at Yale during the spring of 1970. TNJ writers 
profiled Black Panther Bobby Seale, the students who 
served as the models for Garry Trudeau's Doonesbury char-
acters, and former student activist Kurt Schmoke, now 
mayor of Baltimore. 
The May Day issue foliowed a tradition of TNJ theme 
issues. In the past, we have devoted issues to co-education 
at Yale, the Vietnam War's impact on the University and 
AIDS in New Haven. 
Putting out a theme issue is a special event. Long before 
we actually start writing, taking pictures or designing, busi-
nesspeople sell extra advertisements, editors and writers 
track down leads, and designers look for cool graphics. A 
theme issue brings the staff together. Rather than working 
independently until production weekend, writers, photog-
raphers and designers collaborate from the beginning. 
We are already at work on a theme issue for 1991. We 
are eager for your input and invite enthusiastic writers, 
photographers, designers and businesspeople to contribute 
to the project. Even if you have never worked for a maga-
zine, we welcome your ideas and your interest. To join us, 
please come to the Branford Common Room on December 4 
at 9:00 p.m. If you have any questions, please call Motoko 
Rich at 436-0827 or Lisa Silverman at 436-1877.
