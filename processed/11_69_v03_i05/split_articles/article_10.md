**Volume II: The Science of Freedom**
**Author: PETER GAY**

Volume II: The Science of Freedom 
by PETER GAY 
This book completes the brilliant interpretation of 
the Enlightenment which Peter Gay-formerly of 
Columbia, now professor of history at Yale and one 
of the leading authorities on eighteenth-century 
intellectual history-began in The Rise of Modern 
Paganism (r967 National Book Award). 
"Superbly written and elegantly reasoned." 
Eliot Fremont-Smith, The New York Times 
"Profoundly important ... Commitment to criticism, and 
its history, is the theme of Peter Gay's erudite, witty, 
beautifully written book." 
J. H. Plumb, Saturday Review
