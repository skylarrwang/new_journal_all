And, as we have come to expect march-
ing against the government, over these 
five years we have also come to expect 
governments like those of Lyndon Johnson 
and Richard Nixon. We have become 
conditioned to unresponsiveness in the 
White House. We can no longer imagine 
a government we can trust. We expect 
the kind of government we must march 
against. 

This is the real tragedy. 


**Letter from Cambridge**
**Author: Bill Hamilton**

literature or philosophy courses; this year 
there are only three American history 
courses. In addition, there is neither an 
American studies nor an urban studies 
major. 

Lectures are the staple of nearly all 
courses, some of which don't even have 
sections. The few discussion courses there 
are are vastly oversubscribed and must 
be limited. 

Coeducation is making slow progress. 
There are no co-ed dorms, and parietals--
though rarely enforced-have not been 
eliminated. 

Real participation in the decision-mak-
ing process has not yet been achieved. 
Committees continue to recommend 
changes, yet none have come, while stu-
dent government remains powerless. 

But most of all what is absent is that 
elusive atmosphere of respect and cooP: 
eration. No one seems to want to talk wtth 
each other· the faculty came out last April, 
but now s~ms as if they were motivated 
only by fear. The administration lost any 
respect it might have had when Dean 
Glimp (who has since resigned as Dean of 
Harvard College) lied to moderate stu-
dents, telling them that the U~iversity 
would not take any action agamst the 
University Hall seizure until after a meet-
ing of the student body the next day, :Uter 
he bad already participated in the unJ~t 
decision of bringing in the police. Prestdent 
Pusey is nowhere to be found, and he 
might as well not be connected with Har-
vard at all. 

Yet H arvard keeps going, generated it 
seems more by the memory of times p~ 
than by the hopes of things to come. Thts 
does not mean a wholehearted endorse-
ment of Yale or any other college as an 
educational Valhalla, but it is a warning 
that things here are not as they should be, 
that the shock of last year bas not yet 
extricated the ostrich from the sand. May-
be Frank Cham pi realized this better than 
any of us-Harvard may not have another 
such forty-two seconds for a long while. 


**Haydn returns**

No, there is no Met. But New Haven 
opera lovers could rejoice last week, when 
a new company (as yet unnamed) brought 
a splendid production of Haydn's Infidelity 
Foiled to Ezra Stiles College. 

It was enough to make one forget the 
labor troubles that have kept the Met 
silent all season. The singing, the task of an 
ensemble that included a high school 
senior from Wallingford, a Southern Conn 
coed and a couple of Yale School of 
Music instructors, was superb. The musi-
cal direction under Thomas Colville of 
the music school was excellent. 

But it was the opera itself that stole the 
show. Infidelity Foiled bas a plot that it 
takes an mM 360 to decipher; it is a 
masterpiece of the kind of comic opera 
that makes the theater of the absurd look 
like an annotated Shakespeare. 

The virtue of this production was that 
th~ cast-and its fine director, Michael 
Posnick of the drama school-understood 
the opera completely. They realized its 
basic stillness, and thus avoided pomp and 
seriousness. But more importantly they 
realized that beneath an astonishing plot 
lay splendid music, and never did any 
singer allow his tone of whimsy to over-
whelm the music of Haydn. The result 
was a period piece that at once was lightly 
mocked and lovingly embraced. 

Perhaps this company can become a 
permanent fixture around opera-hungry 
Yale-all it needs now is a name. 


**Saturday night, Penn weekend**

After the game that no one went to; after 
the Saturday-Date Dinner that no one 
thought about; after many pipes of dope, 
a six-pack of Schlitz, and a hot fudge 
sundae; paths crossed and they gathered 
in a Yale room to talk and smoke some 
more. A little .. screw Yale" bullshit, then 
drifting into gun talk, imaginary pot shots 
out the window with cowboy guns, army 
guns, Mafia guns. Open a drawer and real 
guns appear, guns from the last five 
American wars. A little more talk, but 
everyone at Yale talks. Just supposin'? 
Choose your weapon, just supposin'? The 
.357 Colt Python is too powerful, too 
loud, going through walls and walls and 
never stoppin'. 

"This .22 single action Ruger, that's 
better, bow loud d'ya think .. . 1" 

"Jeesus watch that fuckin' beer can 
dance across the room, let me try it, and 
where's the dope? Yes, yes. Ah man, the 
hot lead trot." 

"We're gonna get busted for sure." Yeah 
for sure, so why not do it in style, and the 
blasting continues, more shredded beer 
cans, mugs, glasses. Hash pipes and 
revolvers passing among the four laughmg 
loons shrieking convulsively as their 
bullets pepper The American Scholar. 

''That limp dick needed some fire and 
now he's got it." 

.. Ah man, we're gonna get busted. Go 
down and check the noise but first .. !'The 
alarm clock is stopped cold at 11:00 
p.m., a blue spark death, and the decibal 
recorder leaves, storming back into the 
room .. Shit, they can hear that fuckin' gun 
all ov~r the place, we gotta do somethin'. " 

''Turn up the record player." 

More ammo, more hash, more target~, 
laughter. Beer cans flying, books and pamt-
ings ripped, a destroyed art po~~Jio and 
record collection blue smoke nsmg, stray 
bullets ricochetm'g into walls, ceiling, and 
mattresses. The Student Guide to New 
Haven riddled with six quick shots fanned 
from gunfighter stance by the madman 
with rimless glasses. Noise, smoke, 
laughter, dope and poppingligh~.bulbs. 

"We're still gonna get busted. 

.. Let 'em come, but those cops carry 
.38's and all we have is this .22, ob for that 
shit Iovin' Python. We can hold 'em off, 
don't worry." 

But the bust never comes. The ammum-
tion runs out; the room empties. The 
blue smoke lifts and all that's left are ~oles 
in the wall, book confetti, slugs droppmg 
out of Emerson, twisted beer cans, alarm 
clock parts and a ~ale e_x-n;mg all over the 
rug, and Janis Joplin sprnmn~ t~ a halt. 

Four stoned Yalies, one trippmg, one 
drunk, another in a pres-acid numbed con-
fusion, all laugh and wander out to get 
something to eat, their madness suspended 
for a moment; then it dives deeper and 
flows more confidently. 


**Yale Med**

continued from page 8 
"Brewster misses the point of medical 
education. Years ago the research and 
training could be separated from. the needs 
of the community. The commumty t<>?ay, 
though, is no longer a usable comm~chty. 
The university must be connected wtth the 
people. But the community just doesn't 
trust Yale. The university must lear~ to 
relate to society and invite commumty 
participation." 

Now, of course, the community Jacks_ 
the representation it must have to make tts 
needs felt in the Medical Center. Yale has 
argued that community people ~re alr~ady 
involved in Medical Center affatrs, which 
is true to a point. But the kind of com-
munity participation that takes place n?w 
is not tlie kind Max Pepper, F~ 
H~s, 
Lowell Levin or the UCCC had an rnmd. 
Of the sixteen community representatives 
who now serve on the board of Yale-New 
Haven Hospital all but one, Henry ~arker, 
represent a major business interest m town. 

But there is hope. If anything, the ground-
swell of support for Fred Harris proves 
that the Medical Center has come a long 
way since Max Pepper's first forays into 
community participation. In~e~d , th~ Yale 
Council on Community Affarrs Erme 
Osborne feels that the university is begin-
ning to grow in sensiti_vity and awa~eness. 
Yale must give up a slice of the actiOn, be 
says, and allow the community to develop 
its own form of representation. Lowell 
Levin doesn't think that the goals of Yale 
and the community, in fact, need be in-
compatible at all ... Yale has an opportu-
nity, not an obligation," he sa~s, "to help 
research and service comm~ty needs. 
Service has to be part of education, and 
service can be made to enhance rather than 
debilitate that education. The self-interests 
of Yale and the community are close 
together." 

Fred Harris has since been hired by 
Seven-Together as the community's 
"advocate" to the Connecticut Mental 
Health Center. Yale University, which 
would not pay him, helped obtain private 
funds so that the community group could 
pay his salary. Harris's new job, the result 
of over two months of conflict between 
Yale and the community, places him in a 
role independent of the university. 

But even with Harris present to plead 
the case of the inner-city, university policy 
itself has not changed. Yale still believes, 
as President Brewster insisted in Cincin-
nati that its goals are not the same as those 
of the community in which it sits. 

When Max Pepper came to Yale, the 
Medical Center first began to realize that it 
could not sit at the edge of the Hill and 
turn its face the other way forever. 

Pepper's actions proved the first major 
test of community involvement. They spht 
the medical school into factions that 
favored community participation and 
factions that did not. 

The split did not go away after Pepper 
left; it got deeper. The Fr~ Harris c~. 
made the split deeper agam. And so tt wtl~ 
continue, with tensions rising-for not unhl 
the university embarks on a new course 
toward the community will its wounds 
begin to heal. ._
