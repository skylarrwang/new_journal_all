**A Day-Glo Campaign**
**Author: Richard Margolin**

Take a guy hip enough to run a rock concert hall, add some 
psychedelic posters, run him for the City Council and you've 
got ... a losing candidate. 

Ordinarily, political defeats are times of 
bitterness and tears. But when Steve 
Nelson lost his bid for the Cambridge City 
Council, he went to see the Jefferson Air-
plane in concert. Since victory had looked 
dubious, he bad his Pre-Defeat Victory 
Party the night before the election. But 
that's the kind of campaign it had been 
all along. 

Nelson's victory would have been little 
short of a miracle, since it would have 
marked the first election to public office 
of a representative (or more precisely, a 
non-representative) of the Day-Glo Gen-
eration, the American Subculture of 
Youth. True, some hippies did try to take 
over a rural Ca1ifornia town, and Tim 
Leary is running erratically for governor 
of that state, but neither of these efforts 
have successfully focused the enthusiasm 
and ideas of the Woodstock world on a 
concrete and relatively attainable goal. No 
one who bas passed the acid test of 
Haigbt-Ashbury consciousness and who 
moves with youth has yet really tried to 
break into the straight world of politics 
and apply the new thoughts to political 
problems. 

I had a hard time believing Nelson at 
first. You expect from experience that 
every politician will play the old political 
games of on the record/ off the record 
and "don't say I said so, but .... " Nelson 
doesn't do that, though I suppose it's 
partly because he isn't an inveterate po-
litico (this was his first election foray) and 
just doesn't know about these games in 
the first place. But that's just a superficial 
reason. Deep down, he doesn't play 
political games because they are totally 
irrelevant to what he is trying to do. When 
a candidate's whole personality seems to 
say, " Drop all your political pretensions, 
and let's just rap," you have to take 
notice. 

When I first walked into his office (which 
doubled as an apartment) and screamed 
over Janis Joplin on the radio that I 
wanted to see the candidate, a girl said 
that he was out getting a ticket to the 
Jefferson Airplane concert-preparing, as 
it were, for the election night celebration. 

Well, in many ways Steve Nelson could 
almost be a likely person to become a 
candidate for a city council anywhere, let 
alone in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 
Originally the product of the Great Middle 
Class, he was not spared the years of 
schooling which are an integral part of 
the creation of the modern American 
space cowboy. In his case, it was a B.S. in 
math at Cornell and a law degree and 
a degree in Public Administration at 
Harvard. 

With that much education it was fitting 
that Nelson's first job was as a sandal-
maker in Cambridge. During college, he 
bad become deeply interested in rock 
music, and not long ago he was approached 
by the owner of the Boston Tea Party, 
Boston's new rock concert hall, and asked 
to be its manager. 

More recently, he helped found Boston's 
first underground rock station, WBCN. 
With Nelson's help, a station that bad 
been flatteringly beaming out Mantovani 
to its dyspeptic Yankee listeners suddenly 
found itself the lifeline of Boston's grow-
ing hip community. He recalls, "The first 
time we went on the air with a rock 
format, we planned something to blow 
everyone's mind. We were going to do an 
Orson Welles trip with people rushing 
around grabbing microphones and simu-
lating a takeover. And then we would 
have done a rock version of the War of 
the Worlds. But the station owners were so 
totally freaked by this idea that we had to 
settle for The Alternate Plan. When we 
began, it was 10:30 on a Sunday night, 
and they had been playing Mantovani or 
something. Suddenly, Frank Zappa and 
the Mothers of Invention screamed 'Are 
you bung up? Are you bung up?' at the 
audience, and then we went into Cream 
at full volume. The telephones were ring-
ing all night from irate listeners, and in 
the morning, companies who bad used 
our station for Muzak found themselves 
blasting their corridors with that throb-
bing rock beat. It was quite a scene." 

Then Nelson decided that what was 
good for WBCN listeners would be even 
better for the rest of Cambridge-so the 
campaign for the City Council took off. 
Financed with $1800 from Nelson's own 
pocket, there were no claims that the 
candidate would save the city from evil 
or establish law 'n' order.lnstead, a bill-
board with the words .. All Together 
Now," dotted Cambridge, and then came 
a two-minute film showing Nelson walking 
in the country and Nelson on Cambridge's 
main street, with the Beatles' "Come 
Together" as background music. And 
then there were the posters. Some were 
designed by Nelson and others were de-
signed by the famous Mouse/Kelly team, 
who were among the originators of 
psychedelic art. 

Nelson, when it came down to it, didn't 
care what people thought about what 
was happening, but the people who tried 
to explain his campaign to the rest of the 
world were in a difficut position. The 
political radicals tried to write him off as 
a hippie-or worse, a "hippie capitalist" 
-just having a good time. To them, just 
like to conservatives, he wasn't grim 
enough. I asked Nelson if he thought his 
campaign was serious enough in view of 
this criticism, and be said, "Calvinism 
has made this country far too serious. Why 
can't enjoyment be valid in itself? Why 
should people always feel guilty about 
having a good time? The country puts so 
much emphasis on being productive, 
regardless of the consequences. That's 
wrong. If people would co-operate and 
just groove together creatively, the pro-
duction would be a natural result, and 
everyone would be so much happier .... 

''I'm acting on an entirely different 
level from the SDS. I'm trying to work 
out a total life style that goes outside the 
whole spectrum of conservative-liberal-
radicallabels. People who live in cities 
realize every day just bow insane mass 
society is. More and more people are 
understanding that we've got to slow the 
whole thing down. I mean, where are we 
going with all of technology anyway? 
Doesn't that matter a whole lot?" 

As for liberals, they were equally leery 
of the campaign. Nelson says that "I've 
found that liberals just want specific 
answers to the same old issues; rent con-
trol-which I support-and things like that. 
But I'm not too concerned with issues. 
I don't mind admitting that I don't know 
a whole lot about some of the issues, and 
I haven't made up my mind about others. 
If I were elected, I'd want to spend a lot 
of time just learning how this city really 
runs. I don't think it's right to take a stand 
on issues that I don't know enough about 
just to appease certain groups of voters. 
So I say that I don't have all the answers, 
but I just present the ideas I do have and 
show the general bag I'm in, and let the 
voters' imaginations take it from there." 

Steve Nelson didn't win his election. 
He got about 500 votes compared to 2400 
for the first place candidate. Cambridge 
may have Harvard, but down yonder by 
the Charles it's got its share of factories, 
too. But still, that's not bad. Where will 
he go from here? "I think I'U just spend 
some time thinking. People ask me what 
I do for a living, and I always have a hard 
time explaining. I just do a lot of things 
that tie together in some weird way. I 
have my rock club in Amherst, and I'll 
probably just go on doing more of the 
same." 

Nelson does have one new plan. He 
recently offered himself as a candidate for 
the Harvard Corporation. So far, bow-
ever, Nathan Pusey hasn't come running 
over to endorse him. 

There were those who charged that Steve 
Nelson's unique uncampaign was really 
a carefully put-together marketing job of 
reverse psychology. But he is vehement 
in denying this criticism. "I can't agree 
with the radicals that selling something 
that is good makes it bad. The Peace and 
Freedom Party people were angry at me 
for using the straight media too much. 
All I had done was prepare a press re-
lease when I filed suit asking for rent 
control in Cambridge. And the news-
papers reprinted it in full. The Peace and 
Freedom people were just angry that they 
didn't get any coverage. Advertisers are 
out there every day using the best tech-
niques to seU trash, and they succeed! So 
why is it wrong to use good methods to 
sell something that is good? I think it 
would be a bad mistake not to use the 
media as effectively as possible. After all, 
we can't move back from the technological 
age, so we might as well adapt to it. I 
think companies will begin to seU peace 
along with their product. Is that bad? The 
other day I saw an ad for a bread com-
pany that said 'Make Sandwiches, Not 
War', and I thought it was groovy."~
