**Title: Yale Med: how long on top of the Hill?**
**Author: Jim Ross**
**Page number(s): 5-6**

"Yale's medical research goes 
on in laboratories that sit in a 
neighborhood plagued with 
several health problems." 


"The administration's attitude 
had the same effect on the 
students and faculty as Richard 
Nixon's statements have had 
on the anti-war movement." 


On Saturday, November 1, at ll:JOA. M., 
Barry Rand, a third-year Yale Medical 
student, rose to address more than one 
thousand members of the American 
Association of Medical Colleges at their 
annual convention in Cincinnati. He told 
them: "Good medicine is not being 
practiced at Yale-because it is the needs of 
Yale as an institution which are placed 
above the needs of the people it should 
serve." 


As Rand was speaking, Yale President 
Kingman Brewster, Jr. was on his way 
from the Cincinnati airport to the same 
convention, where he was scheduled to 
speak at noon. Brewster arrived a few min .. 
utes early-but too late to hear Rand. He 
sat down in the front row of the auditorium 
in time to bear the speaker who followed 
Rand. Just before he was to speak, 
Brewster learned for the first time that 
Barry Rand-who was sitting two seats 
away from him-had also addressed the 
convention. Then he stepped to the podium 
and quipped, "Not only do we have our 
challenges at home but we have to bring 
them with us ... I think Mr. Rand should 
know that Halloween is over." 


But no one laughed. 


Brewster proceeded to speak for the next 
twenty minutes about university-commun-
ity relations. Four "notions" as to why 
Yale could not assume a major role in the 
community underlined his remarks: 


"We do not have the competence to take 
the responsibility for community service 
enterprises on a large scale, [since] in gen-
eral universities are not good managers; 


"If we were to take on this responsibility 
we would perform our principal task less 
well, [that of] pushing the frontiers of 
general scientific inquiry and sharing the 
results [with] the next generation ... In 
the search for truth we cannot undercut or 
dilute or distract or distort what we are 
best at; 


"No matter how useful it is for the 
training of students or for the problems it 
offers for study and research, the manage-
ment of a community service activity 
involves obligations which are at least 
different from, and may on occasion be 
adverse to, the interests of the academy; 


"In the case of private universities at 
least, there is a basic misfit between com-
munity needs and the sources of our 
principal support ... Political pressure 
from the ghetto neighborhoods in New 
Haven upon my institution, however, is 
likely to fall on politically deaf ears in 
Hartford, which is not in the habit of sup-
porting Yale. The same neigh~rhood 
pressure will also fall on financtally deaf 
ears among my out-of-town alumni, who 
are not in the habit of supporting New 
Haven." 


Brewster added to his four notions the 
idea that "society, too, will be better served 
if we continue to limit our proprietary 
responsibility to our principal task of dis-
covery, conservation and transmission 
of knowledge." He encouraged the local, 
State and federal agencies to "pull up their 
socks" and deal with community problems 
so that the universities can "go back to 
work." 


Brewster's speech was well received by 
the AAMC. Rand did not receive the same 
reaction. Rand had broken up the placid 
cadence of praise for medical-community 
relations which seemed pleasing to the

deans and administrators who made up the 
audience. The men who had been com-
fortably propped on an elbow were startled 
to the edge of their chairs. Rand had not 
intended, of course, to pacify the distin-
guished gentlemen when he said that 
"there is a new generation of health science 
students ... tired of talk that does not 
match action, tired of talk of peace and 
acts of war, talk of service, acts of control, 
talk of concerns, acts of abuse ... we are 
tired of talk, tired of non-action, tired of 
reasons why not." 


Rand went to Cincinnati as a representa-
tive of the Yale University Community 
Crisis Committee, an organization of 
health service students, faculty, and em-
ployees of the Yale Medical Center con-
cerned with Yale's relation to the city 
of New Haven. 


There is a growing concern about this in 
the medical school-and for good reason. 
The School of Medicine and the Yale-New 
Haven Hospital are the two institutions at 
Yale that relate most directly to the com-
munity. Unlike other graduate schools, the 
medical school cannot operate with books 
alone. It needs people. And the Hill neigh-
borhood, the ghetto that begins at the 
Medical Center's doorstep, provides most 
of them. Yale's medical facilities make it 
the primary resource for health care in the 
city. But for all too long the patients it 
serves have been viewed as simply adjuncts 
to the teaching and research duties of the 
medical school, not as people to be cared 
for on their own terms. In the words of 
Margaret Leslie, Hill resident and Execu-
tive Director of the Citizen's Committee 
for the Development of Education, "Yale 
Jives sumptuously in the midst of poverty, 
offering crumbs that fall from its table." 


What Yale has in the midst of poverty 
is a complex that encompasses schools of 
nursing and public health, the Yale Psychi-
atric Institute, the Yale Child Study Center 
and the Connecticut Mental Health Cen-
ter.lts budget is more than $60 million a 
year. At any one time the number of 
personnel-students, faculty employees and 
patients-totals more than six thousand. 


Nearly seventy-five percent of the 
medical school's operations are financed 
through federal research grants-one rea-
son, perhaps, that research and not 
community health care is at present the 
primary activity. Another reason is that, as 
President Brewster stated, research does 
bring many real and important benefits to 
Yale as an institution. Much of the nation's 
leading medical research is done here; 
Yale scientists do, as Brewester said in Cin-
cinnati, "push the frontiers of genuine 
scientific inquiry in the search for truth." 


What is ironic is that they are unable to 
push a much closer frontier-the one right 
outside their laboratory windows. For 
Yale's research goes on in the middle of a 
neighborhood plagued with severe health 
problems. 


When federal funds do become available 
for community service projects, the grants 
must be processed and approved by Yale, 
making it all the more difficult for money 
to filter down to the community. Still, some 
funds are not channeled totally into the 
research laboratory. In July of 1966, Dr. 
Max Pepper and Dr. Leonard Fichten-
1;1aum received a federal sta.ffing grant to 
implement and experiment with a relative-
ly new and unsophisticated field:-com- . 
oity psychiatry. Some called thetr expen-
iment a success and others, a failure, but all


agreed that it caused cleavages in the 
Medical Center that remain to this day. 


Community medicine as Pepper and 
Fichtenbaum were about to try it is essen-
tially preventive medicine. It emphasizes 
the importance of dealing with the envi-
ronment of the individual. The theory 
behind this type of medicine is that only 
by dealing with the source-the conditions 
in the patient's community-will doctors be 
able to reduce the incidence, length and 
severity of psychiatric problems. 


Pepper and Fichtenbaum organized a 
unit within the Connecticut Mental Health 
Center- a part of the Yale Medical Center 
funded by the state-to service residents of 
the Hill and nearby West Haven. 


With ten staff members, including three 
residents, an expansive program, little 
funding and 72,000 potential patients, 
Pepper and Fichtenbaum entered the 
neighborhoods. The staff discovered a need 
for programs for alcoholism, drug abuse, 
mental retardation, juvenile delinquency, 
educational and vocational handicaps, 
neglect of illegitimate children, disorders 
of the aged, adult crime, family life and a 
sense of loss of community identity. 


They decided to attack the problems 
immediately and hoped that training 
would evolve as the staff listened andre-
sponded to the community. The unit 
could establish contacts and solidify a base 
for operations. Patients were not placed 
on waiting lists and had to be seen within 
one week of initial contact. The staff also 
reached out into the community with 
speaking engagements, seminars and home 
visits. The pace was hectic. 


In the experimental region of about 
72,000 people the unit tried to develop a 
program of total psychiatric care. This 
meant consulting with community agen-
cies on social disorganization and public 
education. It meant treating as many 
patients as possible and at the same time 
involving patients in administrative 
decisions. The Hill-West Haven unit had 
to work with the community rather than 
for the community. In addition, the unit 
was designed to maintain the highest 
quality of research and training in the 
traditional therapeutic services. The unit 
supplied emergency services, in-patient 
service and an out-patient clinic, educa-
tional and consultation services and a staff 
of field workers. 


Within the community, tangible results 
were soon evident. The unit was interact-
ing successfully with the neighborhood. 
A Hill Interagency Council (HIC) was 
created to coordinate the functions of 
community agencies-social, educational 
and religious. The Hill Health Council 
developed from HIC, and the Council 
later established the Hill Health Center. 


By the summer of 1967, the priorities of 
the unit had become the priorities of the 
community. Then the unit's role as a part 
of the community was tested dramatically. 
That summer the New Haven inner-city 
exploded in the heat of August into a major 
disturbance-or, in the words of the local 
press, into a race riot. Pepper and his staff 
sensed growing hysteria in the HiU as a 
result of bomb threats and fear of police 
action. The second floor of the CMHC was 
taken over as a barracks for state troopers 
(who were later moved), further upsetting 
the community. 


At the height of the disturbances on 
August 18, Max Pepper was serving as 
Acting Director of the CMHC, for both 
the regular director, Dr. Gerald K.Jerman, 
and the newly-a pointed dean of the School 
of Medicine, Dr. Fredrick C. Redlich, 
were out of town on vacation. Pepper saw 
his chance to plunge the CMHC deeply 
intp community affairs. He called an 
emergency staff meeting at 3 A.M., with 
Dr. Fichtenbaum and Dean Florence S. 
Wald of the School of Nursing among 
those present. The group decided to take 
advantage of its good prestige within the 
Hill and responded to the situation by 
setting up a twenty-four-hour service unit 
and a fact-finding team to re-establish 
communication within the community. 


Pepper and his staff asked Mayor Richard 
Lee to meet with them to develop plans for 
restoring order. Lee refused. 


Then, due to the increasing fears of 
further trouble in the Hill, community 
representatives approached Pepper and 
asked to bus residents out of the area. 
Pepper responded with a CMHC-spon-
sored busing program to emergency 
housing outside the Hill, such as faculty 
homes, using the CMHC building as a 
temporary stopover. The CMHC's involve-
ment in New Haven's unrest was ac-
celerating. 


City officials were enraged at the busing 
program, and charged the CMHC with 
injecting terrorism into the community. 
Dean Redlich and Dr. K.Jerman returned 
from their vacations to condemn the 
CMHC's actions. K.Jerman asked for and 
received review power over Pepper's 
decisions and immediately ceased the 
busing program. By the time of the admin-
istrators' return, however, the disturbances 
bad subsided. It was too late to erase 
whatever impact Pepper's actions had had 
on the community. All Redlich could do 
was accuse Pepper of having been too 
partisan and too involved-and claim Pep-
per had exceeded the limits of his area 
of competence in psychiatry. 


Pepper viewed the crisis as an opportu-
nity to break down barriers and inspire 
trust. The Yale medical school bad, for the 
first time, taken meaningful steps in the 
area of community involvement. The com-
munity identified with the CMHC and 
trusted Pepper and his staff. But such com-
munity action was not acceptable to 
the administrative establishment of the 
Medical Center. Soon Max Pepper left 
Yale to become a director of community 
medicine in St. Louis. 


The Hill remembers Pepper. Ernie 
Osborne, Acting Director of Yale's 
Council on Community Affairs and then 
Director of Redevelopment for the Hill 
Interagency Council, says "Everything you 
see in health services in New Haven is to a 
great degree the result of Max Pepper's 
work. We will never truly realize what he 
has done." 


Two years later, the CMHC remains the 
most community-oriented facility of the 
medical school. But after Pepper's depar-
ture, it bas not been able to exchange ideas 
with its neighbors nearly as effectively. The 
research-service conflict still exists in the 
CMHC; its priorities are no longer as close 
to those of the community. 


The present administration knows the 
gulf that exists between it and the commu-
nity. It attempted to close the gap this past 
year, when in April CMHC Director 
Klerman appointed Fred Harris, former 
President of the Hill Parents' Association 
and a recognized community leader, to the 
trial position of Special Assistant to the 
Director of the CMHC. K.Jerman made the 
appointment so that Harris might "sensi-
tize us to how we were being perceived by 
the black community" and help the staff to
