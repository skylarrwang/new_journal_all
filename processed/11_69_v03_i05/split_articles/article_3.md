too, was at least ironic for a man who 
wept openly at his first campaign press 
conference. 


As far as I could see, the press, for the 
most part, began actually trying to like 
Mario Procaccino. They were ready to 
believe that he was, as be said after the 
primary, a good progressive Democrat. 
But the candidate never seemed to give 
these people a chance. His position paper 
on Parks and Recreation was plagiarized. 
He lied. And, on the ABC-TV debate, 
he waved a piece of paper and said: "I 
have here a list of names ... " 


"Dammit," said a reporter I was stand-
ing next to at the time. "I hate Lindsay. 
I can't stand him. But be just got my vote." 


As the campaign progressed, the press's 
Mario Procaccino jokes seemed to get 
nastier. At first it was amusing that 
Procaccino, while campaigning in China-
town, declared that Lindsay didn't have 
a "Chinaman's chance" to win the elec-
tion, or that he told a group of Negroes 
that "my heart is as black as yours," or 
that be vowed, if elected, to return the 
city to "an inept administration." Eventu-
ally, they started saying that Mario was 
so confident of winning the election, he 
had already ordered the linoleum for the 
Gracie Mansion living room. 


What had all this-the green Jews, the 
Mets, the hysterical press conferences, 
the rallies-to do with the issues of where 
New York was going, and how each can-
didate might take it there? Very little, 
for of course the campaign, like all other 
campaigns, was one of personalities and 
potholes, not issues. 


For Lindsay, having inspected shiny 
new snow equipment in Queens, and 
having repaired the pavement in Brooklyn 
and the Bronx, succeeded, by the cam-
paign's end, in also conveying a personality 
of calm, efficient and humane liberalism. 
He had overcome his identification with 
the rich and poor and was able to eke 
out enough support in the middle class 
to carry him through Election Day. Ulti-
mately, I think, these voters decided 
that the job-"the second toughest job in 
America"-was just too big for a puffy 
little Bronx version of the Great Gilder-
sleeve who seemed to be forever trundling 
up and down the streets of Sheepshead 
Bay and Far Rockaway jabbing his finger 
at cameras and microphones, shouting, 
"Who do yah trust, folks? Do yah trust 
John Lindsay? (No!) Do yah trust Mario 
Procaccino? (Yes!)" 


It's not, of course, that the voters, in 
responding to a sophisticated media cam-
paign, rejected the "Old Politic.s," what-
ever that is. Instead, the voters embraced 
a well-run version of the former, over a 
disastrously-run version of the latter. 


This year's campaign bad enough con-
tradictions to make it as unpredictable, 
Max Lemer would say, as a horse race on 
a muddy track. There were no political 
experts to listen to, and no instincts to 
go by. But to anyone with even a passing 
interest in politics, the campaign, until 
the bitter end-when reporters seemed tCI 
be punchy with the grotesquerie of it aU-
was a circus of fascinating activity. 


The reporter's view of all this is, not 
surprisingly, an ironic one. On the one 
hand, he is the confidante, the man who 
travels in the corridors of power-even in 
New York's gothic Municipal Building, 
where they get pretty narrow-the insider. 
the one whose shoulder every Procaccino 
aide seemed to cry on when the going 
got rough. What can we do, one top 
Procaccino adviser asked a reporter, to 
somehow give Mario the stature, to make 
people believe he has some ability? The 


reporter suggested that they arrange to 
have the candidate testify in Washing-
ton, D.C., before a Congressional com-
mittee, on a sophisticated and perfectly 
abstruse subject like finance. After all, the 
candidate was the Controller. So the 
Procaccino staff tried to get a committee 
to listen to him, but the only subject 
anyone in Washington could agree to was 
"Pornography and the U.S. Mail." 


On the other hand, the newsman is 
mostly an outsider, a voyeur. The other 
day, for example, about twenty newsmen 
from all media stood shivering on the 
porch of Gracie Mansion as Mayor 
Lindsay met in the warm inside with the 
defeated John Marchi. 


The scheduled time for picture-taking 
and interviews had long passed, without 
an appearance from the principles, and 
now the sun bad gone down behind the 
sterile-looking luxury apartment buildings 
on East End A venue. It was bitter cold, 
but we had to wait outside, because in 
New York City there is only a tiny press 
room in the basement on the other side 
of the mayor's house, much too small for 
aU of us, and, right now, much too out of 
the way. 


A reporter stared out at the bleak and 
gray scene of the East River, the man-
sion's backyard lawn and the children's 
fragile tree-house nestled in the lone and 
leafless maple in the center of the yard. 
The reporter stamped his foot to keep the 
circulation going. "Goddamn mayor," 
he muttered. "You think they could afford 
a goddamn press-room in the 'greatest 
city in the world.' I see they already took 
the phones out of the basement. and you 
have to use the pay phones now. The 
campaign is over." 


LindsayÂ·s press secretary, wearing a 
polka-dot tie and wire-rim glasses, bounced 
out and said they would be ready in fifteen 
minutes. "Come on, we're freezing out 
here," shouted the reporter. He turned to 
me and muttered, "I never wanted to 
vote for that bastard anyway."
