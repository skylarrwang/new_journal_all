understand the special needs of the area's 
residents. But the result of KJerman's 
efforts was another crisis. 

During the six months from April to 
September, Harris persistently argued the 
community's point of view as he plunged 
head first into the services-research argu-
ment. He fought for better care and con-
stantly reminded the staff, director and 
the medical school dean of his people's 
problems. Harris listed ten complaints: 
1. The staff is not responsive to black 
and Puerto Rican people in the in-patient 
units. 2. There are not enough black 
people accepted for treatment at the 
Mental Health Center. 3. Too many black 
and Puerto Rican people are sent to the 
Connecticut Valley State Hospital [a 
facility poorly equipped for mental health 
care]. 4. CMHC does not deal with the 
major problems presented by the poor, 
blacks and Puerto Ricans. 5. There is no 
Spanish-speaking staff. 6. The community 
staff is not large enough. 7. There is poor 
training in urban problems for profes-
sionals. 8. Research projects involving 
patients are undertaken without informing 
them. 9. There are not enough fully trained 
people seeing the poor, black and Puerto 
Rican patients. 10. The Community has 
no official voice in setting the priorities of 
the CMHC. Harris and the community 
felt they could not trust the professionals 
at the CMHC. Their needs were no longer 
being met. 

On September 2, Dean Redlich met with 
H arris and community residents to discuss 
some of H arris's objections. Dr. Morton 
Reiser, who had taken over as director of 
the CMHC one day earlier, was also pre-
sent. H arris's trial period as community 
consultant was nearing its end, and Hill 
residents were anxious to know whether he 
would be reappointed. 

As the discussion drew to a close, Harris 
and the Hill residents wanted Redlich to 
sign a statement including some of the 
changes he had verbally proposed at the 
meeting. Redlich refused to put his words 
into writing and began to leave. Then 
Harris, in anger, shook Redlich-and the 
shake set off shock waves that formed the 
core of the new controversy of the CMHC. 
Redlich saw Harris's action as a serious 
disruption. He described the events in a 
memo in the following way: "At that point 
Mr. Harris lunged at the Dean [Redlich], 
grabbed him by the throat and used vitu-
perative and threatening language. He was 
controlled within a brief moment by other 
community representatives." 

Mary Charlson, a medical student, saw 
things differently. "Harris just shook him 
a little bit," she says. "The Dean began the 
exchange of 'vituperative language.' " 

Shortly after the meeting Redlich ad-
dressed a letter to the Hill Health Board 
deploring the tactics used and reaffirming 
his unwillingness to act under threat and 
coercion. A September 29 statement by 
Dean Redlich outlines the events that 
followed the controversial meeting, and 
adds a vital point: "On September 16, 
1969, Dr. Reiser informed Mr. Harris in a 
private interview that he was unwilling, 
because of the behavior of Mr. Harris in 
the meeting of September 2, to offer him a 
new appointment as Special Assistant to 
the Director." 

Reiser then met with a newly organized 
commun ity group called Seven-Together 
(which represented seven inner-city neigh-
borhoods) on September 17 and agreed as 
an act of good faith to accept a person 
nominated by them to fill the position of 
community adviser. Reiser took care to 
express his desire not to have Harris re-
nominated. 

Seven-Together did, however, nom-
inate Fred Harris. Reiser honored his 
commitment and supported Harris's 
reappointment. 

Dean Redlich, however, continued to 
disapprove of the appointment, and in a 
September 29 memo stated: "In keeping 
with the personnel practices of Yale 
University and the state, officials from 
both institutions indicated they would not 
reinstate Mr. Harris in their employ. Both 
institutions based their decision on the fact 
that he had used coercive behavior against 
an officer of the university. In addition, 
these institutions are not willing to delegate 
the ultimate decision of employment to an 
outside group, especially if the employee 
is not acceptable to the employer." Redlich 
then suggested that Harris could serve as a 
community-paid "advocate" in the future. 

Redlich's intransigence helped the 
faltering Seven-Together to organize 
behind a common purpose. They de-
manded a position for Harris .within the 
CMHC structure, and rejected Redlich's 
compromise, for they lacked the funds 
themselves to pay Harris's salary as a com-
munity "advocate." 

Seven-Together was not the only organi-
zation that Redlich's decision sprung into 
action. In late September tbe' University 
Community Crisis Committee was born, 
and began its campaign for Harris with a 
rally in front of Harkness Medical Dor-
mitory at which speakers from the faculty, 
student body and community asked the 
university to honor its commitment to the 
community. Dr. Morris Wessel of the 
medical school faculty told the gathering: 
"What is really at stake is the ability-or 
the inability-of this university to meet its 
verbalized commitments in an honorable 
manner." 

A petition circulated by the Crisis com-
mittee urged the CMHC to rehire Harris. 
On September 30, UCCC representatives 
met with Provost Charles Taylor Jr., Dean 
Redlich, Dr. Reiser and medical school 
department chairmen. They read the 
petition to Provost Taylor and a student 
spokesman told the administrators that 
the university was "taking from the com-
munity and not putting back into it. This 
makes our education as students here 
difficult." Redlich and Taylor answered 
by affirming the University's stand which 
prevents employing a man who used 
coercive action against an official of the 
university. Taylor added: "Naturally the 
university should make its own decision 
about the employment of any individual." 

On October 7, President Brewster 
presented essentially the same answer to 
the UCCC in a private meeting. About ten 
students and community people picketed 
outside Woodbridge Hall, carrying signs 
that said "yALE USES THE COMMUNITY" 
and "yALE DON"T KEEP ITS WORD." 

The next day, the Yale Corporation 
met at Woodbridge Hall. The UCCC tried 
to arrange a meeting with Corporation 
members but received no answer to its 
inquiries. As the Corporation met inside, 
the UCCC picketed Woodbridge HaU 
again. 

When the Corporation broke for l~ch, . 
William Horowitz a member who lives m 
New H aven, walk~ out of Woodbridge 
Hall and ran into his old friend Dr. Morris 
Wessel, who was among the picketers. 
"HeUo, Morris, nice to see you again," 
said Horowitz. 

"Hello, Bill," said Wessel. 

"What are you doing standing out 
here?" Horowitz asked. 

"I'm picketing the Corporation," replied 
Dr. Wessel. "Why don't you join us? Then 
you'll be on the right side of the issue." 

Horowitz laughed and walked away.


The administration's attitude had the same 
effect upon the dissenting students and 
faculty as Richard Nixon's statements have 
had on the anti-war movement. It only 
served to strengthen the opposition. 

But the anger in the medical school is 
not tied to this one issue. Opposition, as 
the Max Pepper case showed, began l~ng 
before the Redlich-H arris confrontation, 
and gives every indication of continuing 
long after, as Barry Rand proved in 
Cincinnati. 

In his speech Rand ex pres~~~ student 
sentiment of the UCCC. He satd: I came 
to Yale seeking exceJience in medical 
education, seeking training which would 
teach me to serve those people who des-
perately need health care. Yet how can 
I learn good medicine where good med-
icine is not being practiced? 

"President Brewster, why is it that Yale's 
response to two of the major healt~ . 
problems in New H aven-drug a~dtc~IOD 
and alcoholism-is largely one of mstltu-
tional indifference? Already I have had to 
send alcoholics back to the streets b.e~~use 
the Yale Medical Center has no facilttt~ to 
treat them. Already I have had to commtt 
a nineteen-year-old mother with t"':o . 
young children to the state me.ntalmstitu· 
tion ... when she sought help m our 
Emergency Room to overcome be~ drug 
addiction. With Yale's new expenstve 
federally-financed methadone ~arch 
program, why was there no place m Ne~ 
Haven to assist her? Why have communrty 
demands for detoxification of beCs in the 
Yale-administered Community M_e~tal 
Health Center been denied? Why ts tt tJ;lat 
Yale, the major provider of health ~~rvtces 
in New Haven, is unwilling to partJctpate 
significantly in the C?~unity·in~tiated 
fight against lead pOtso.nmg? P~e~rdent 
Brewster, isn't preventive medtcme a . 
priority at Yale? ... It is appa~ent t~at m-
ferior community health servtce eXIsts at 
the Yale-New Haven Medical Center." 

Medical school students at Yale rarely 
have time for activism. Their days are 
filled with classes, labs and hours of ??s· 
pi tal duty to the point of making pohttcal 
involvement almost a luxury. Indeed, the 
community issue now at the fore is the only 
time in recent memory that a sizeable core 
of medical school students have been 
concerned enough about a cause to find 
time to fight for it. 

Many faculty members are ~y~pathe_trc 
- but others are apathetic, unwilhng to r~k 
their jobs or pleased with their opportu~­
ties for research and teaching and choosrng 
not to rock the boat. "'Ibe only r~n 
some faculty members would constde.r , 
doing anything at all for~~ commumty, 
one medical student says, ts because ~ey 
know they have to walk through the Htll 
to get to their cars at night." 

One faculty member whose concern for 
the Hill goes somewhat deeper~ Dr. 
Lowell Levin, Professor of Pubhc Healt? 
in the School of Epidimeology and P ubhc 
Health. A sincere and vocal opponent 
of medical school policies, Levin says,
