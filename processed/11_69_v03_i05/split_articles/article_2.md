Years ago, when decentralization was a 
synonym for states' rights in the South, and 
when borough presidents in New York 
did more than cut ribbons and run for 
re-election, John T. (Pat) Clancy met with 
reporters in his office the day after his 
election as President of the Borough of 
Queens.


The newsmen asked for Clancy's vision 
of his new job, now that he bad been 
elected, and at the very least for some kind 
of outline of his plans.


''The first thing I'm going to do," said 
Clancy, "is fix the potholes in the streets."


Come on, the reporters said. Trivial 
matters aside, what was he really going to 
do as borough president?


"I'm serious," Clancy said. "You can 
talk all you want about the issues. But 
when a guy in my district drives out of 
the driveway and on to a bunch of gaping 
potholes every morning on the way to 
work, and his car lurches and shakes, that 
guy curses the name of the man who's 
supposed to fix the streets, and that's me. 
Each day it happens, that guy curses the 
name-my name. That's plenty of rein-
forcement. And that's why I'm going to 
fix those potholes."


I wasn't there, but I'm sure this story 
is true. Clancy's point was conveyed 
vividly to me during the mayoral cam-
paign, when I was riding with John Marchi 
in his blue Pontiac stationwagon-"my 
limousine,•• he wou1d say-racing through 
the traffic one weekday evening on the 
way to one of the endless engagements he 
made this fall in his bid for the mayoralty.


Having appeared at a raucous annual 
dinner-dance of the Bronx Liquor Dealers' 
Association, Marchi was now speeding 
to a Republican gathering in Queens.


Behind time, the wagon weaved in and 
out of traffic and then, not far from the 
Triborough Bridge, thumped jarringly 
over a pothole. The car's frame shook and 
two of the Senator's aides literally hit the 
ceiling.


"You all right? Are you all right?" 
Marchi asked.


"Ok, I'm ole Just a little shook up," 
came the reply.


"You know," Marchi said to me, 
smiling, "you know, I guess sometimes it 
is just those little things .... "


A week before the election, the last time 
I saw Mayor Lindsay campaign, he was 
speaking to a Jewish synagogue in Fresh 
Meadows, Queens. The Rabbi began his 
introduction with an anecdote.


A few days before, the Rabbi said, be 
was driving to the synagogue when be 
noticed that several lamps in a nearby 
park had been vandalized and broken. He 
contacted the mayor's office that day, be 
recalled, and the following morning the 
lamps had been repaired.


"Mayor Lindsay bas made some mis-
takes," said the Rabbi, "but he's admitted 
them, and he seems now to be on the 
road to correcting at least some of them."


Then, noting that in a Jewish service, 
anyone who gives a sermon has to be a 
rabbi, the spiritual leader of the Fresh 
Meadows Jewish Center introduced the 
Mayor of New York City-"Rabbi 
Lindsay."


1969, of course, proved to be a very 
trying year for Rabbi Lindsay, who last 
winter was the subject of so much scorn 
and vilification, it was hard to believe 
that be wou1dn't be tarred, feathered and 
run out of town before the election, let 
alone suffer the greatest defeat any in-
cumbent ever cou1d have in New York.


Maybe the turning point came when 
the Mets woo, as some have suggested. 
Lindsay is bored by baseball-it's much too 
passive a sport for him-and the night 
before the final game of the World Series, 
which several million of his constituents 
on the street would have given an arm 
and a leg to see, Lindsay was handed his 
schedu1e for the next day. "Christ," the 
mayor said angrily, "do I have to go out 
to the goddarno ballpark again tomorrow?"


But there he was, nonetheless, grinning 
stiffly as champagne flowed down his 
broad shou1ders and over his modishly 
tailored suit. Someone came up to him to 
have him meet Ralph Kiner, the Mets' 
radio announcer.


"Kiner ... Kiner ... ," Lindsay said, 
snapping his fingers, groping for the 
identity of the name. "Ob, yes-I know 
Rabbi Kiner. Where is he?"


On the bulletin board back at Lindsay 
headquarters, campaign workers in mini-
skirts and Bill Blass ties with "Lindsay 
Lindsay Lindsay" written all over them 
moved colored pins across a map of 
Queens County. The pins were colored 
red (for pro-Lindsay), blue Oeaoing to 
Lindsay), green Oeaoing away) and white 
(anti).


Thus, it was the green Jews that Lindsay 
needed to win over. He already had the 
loyalty of blacks, who were generally 
red, except when they owned property-
then they were blue. Most Jews in Man-. 
hattan were blue. In the "outer boroughs" 
the Jews were green, except when they 
had low incomes and lived near blacks. 
Then they were white, as were most 
Italians and Irish.


Thus, the Mayor attended a lifetime of 
Sabbath Services and carried, in the 
glove compartment of his black limousine, 
a yarmu1ke monogrammed with the let-
ters "JVL." Four years ago, a person 
who merely caught a glimpse of can-
didate Lindsay was a probable voter. "He's 
gorgeous," women would say. This ye.ar, 
they looked and said: "He looks so tired. 
He should get some rest."


Lindsay did look tired-his face was 
gaunt. I saw him frequently when he 
looked ashen and skeletal. The mayor 
never seemed to sleep. After final late-
night speeches, he went home for several 
meetings with aides. Retiring at close to 
2:00A.M., he was awake by 6:45A.M. 
preparing for another day that would keep 
him churning past midnight.


By contrast, there were many days 
when Mario Angelo Procaccino made no 
public appearances at all. This, I think, 
tended to irk some reporters, who were 
frequently told only at the last minute to 
rush out to Brooklyn or the Bronx with 
the Controller for, say, a hurried look at 
a desecrated synagogue. Very often, the 
campaign organization neglected to 
provide transportation, and when they 
assembled enough newsmen to watch 
Mario strut up and down a street, the 
candidate said nothing of substance. You 
cou1d always get a couple of photographs 
of his bussing an Italian matron or slap-
oping truck drivers on the back, but cou1d 
such stuff last for a long, long campaign?


I'm told that Procaecino infuriated the 
TV stations when he accepted the New 
York Tinus debate after ignoring invita-
tions from all the networks. He said he 
did it because be wanted Lindsay's state-
ments to appear "in black and white," 
which to this day makes no sense at all. He 
also didn't want Lindsay to "emote" 
before the cameras, Mario said. This,
