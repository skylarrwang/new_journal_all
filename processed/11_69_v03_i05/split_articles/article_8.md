and he brandishes the microphone 
· stand over his head. He flings his 
tambourine into the crowd. He uses the 
close of the song perfectly to taunt, 
I can't get no, 
You can't get no, 
I want some, 
I need some, 
I'm gonna get tome, 
You need some, 
You can't get none, 
We're gonna get some. 
He is together with the crowd, and 
the world will serve him. He would 
carry his people and destroy London if 
he wanted to. "I can't get no ... I'm 
gonna get some ... satisfaction." His 
promise that the band would "get it 
together before we go" was working 
·itself true. From "Satisfaction" they 
drove into "Street Fighting Man." The 
violence is rising; he sings tough and 
dances hard. 

But he changes direction again and 
brings on his final surprise. Ginger 
Johnson and the African drummers 
come on stage. There are five extra 
drummers and a dancer-dressed only 
with dried grass over his neck, a head-
dress, and white paint designs all over 
his body. The African prances with his 
spear, dancing about Jagger. Jagger 
responds, smiling with delight. They 
dance separately, but they are mutually 
inspired. They do a short samba, Jagger 
rippling and dipping with awesome 
speed. 

They close with "Sympathy for the 
Oevil"-pure Jagger, pure Stones. It 
opens with drums, Watts staying com-
Riex but insistent, the Africans bounc-
ing and pulsing. The audience claps 
and beats tambourines. The song con-
tains all the inexorable bitterness and 
paradox of Jagger's soul. It is straight 
and long. 

Please allow me to introduce myself, 
I'm a man of wealth and taste. 
He throbs and stretches the words in 
his mouth. He is all forward and thrust. 
The drummers smile and laugh and 
work hard. 

I've been around for many a long year, 
Stole many a man's soul and faith. 
I was around when Jetus cried, had hi a moment 
of doubt and pain. 
Made damn sure that Pilate washed hit hands and 
sealed hit fate. 
This mystery is that big. He shrieks. The 
risen Christ, good and evil, evil. 

I shouted out 'Who killed the Kennedys' 
When after all it waa you and me, 
Just as every cop ia a criminal, 
And all the sinners saints. 
He will not stop. The drums beat it into 
us, Jagger's eyes cannot be escaped, 
his dance condemns. 

So if you meet me have some courtesy, 
Have some tympathy and aome taste. 
Show all your well-learned policiet 
Or l'lllay your soul to watte. 
The sweet sta r. The drums go on and 
on, and he presses, "Tell me baby, 
what's my name," again and again. The 
African joins him in his dance. They 
watch each other, and Jagger ap-
proaches him slowly. They stretch out 
their arms to touch, but Jagger retreats. 
He comes on again, the Africans driving 
for a confrontation. As they come close, 
the African beckons. Jagger takes his 
shoulders, but just before they embrace, 
he shudders, turns and slides away. The 
African is rebuked. He falls on his 
back with his feet in the air. Jagger 
stands above him conquerer, torturer-
the witch that has escaped the doctor. 
He finds his tunic, roams across the 
stage blowing kisses and silent good-
byes. He sits, his work almost done. 
"Yeah, we had a good time," still in 
time with the drums. "We had a good 
time ... Hope you had a good time ... 
well, we gotta go now, really gotta go 
now." The crowd roars no in response. 
Girls struggle at the front of the stage, 
trying to climb up and touch him. He 
smiles on. When one girl begins to 
make it on the stage, the crew throws 
her back down. Jagger tells them to get 
out. He quietly rises and dances lightly. 
"Guess we gotta go now ... We got 
to go, Lucifer." 

He wanders slowly from the mike, 
blowing kisses, turning to take a last 
look. The band keeps riffing for a few 
seconds and then quietly leaves. They 
jump into the armored truck and move 
off. The whole crowd looked around, 
thought of themselves again and waited 
to be able to move. For those who 
could never see, it was just a long after-
noon. Those who loved Brian Jones 
must have felt that he was gone and 
forgotten. For the rest, every butterfly 
wasdead. ~
