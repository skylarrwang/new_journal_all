Saturday felt, in so many ways, like a 
requieum for the peace movement. It was 
big, it was glorious, it was fun, it was cool. 
You had to have a good time. But we'd 
all been through it before, and suddenly, 
at the height of Saturday's success, you 
could feel it all beginning to wear out. 
Maybe this time it was too big, too 
glorious. Or maybe it was just too old. It 
was the same broken record, again and 
again, five years later.


Even Norman Mailer couldn't think of 
anything new to say. Riding in from the 
airport the night before, he talked idly of 
how violence would play right into Nixon's 
hands. He wasn't there to write another 
Armies of the Night; this time he was 
only along to march, perhaps as much out 
of momentum as anything else.


Friday night the scenario played itself 
further. I watched the cops confront the 
kids at DuPont Circle-tear gas and "Fuck 
the pigs" and sirens and moustaches-and 
it ended in a draw, with nobody con-
vincing anybody of anything. I got more 
than a few whiffs of tear gas, so maybe I 
was a little partial to the demonstrators. 
But it was still empty, and still predictable, 
and had all happened before.


Then dawned Saturday, crisp, cold and 
beautiful. It was-well, yes, it was a per-
fect day for the march. And the march 
complied, and was perfect.


No, make that spectacular, for it was. 
It was a beautiful thing to straggle up the 
flagpole around the Washington Monu-
ment and see a quarter of a million people 
singing below. It was inspiring and ex-
citing to hear Reverend Coffin-whose 
short, humble invocation was a master-
piece of graceful strength-and Dick 
Gregory and Arlo Gutherie and Pete 
Seeger. When they spoke, the day flashed 
full with meaning. But the others-so many 
of them, so well intentioned, so political. 
How few had the honesty of Leonard 
Bernstein, who greeted the crowd simply 
with a wave of his hand and a happy, "I'm 
glad to be here!" Instead they talked on 
and on, with rhetoric better than anything 
else said in politics, but political rhetoric 
just the same.


Last Saturday was the peace move-
ment's first major effort since the October 
Moratorium, since the movement had 
made it big. It had been shooting for the 
big time since the days of Gene McCarthy 
-no, really since its very beginning. Now 
it has made it, and wonderful though 
Saturday's march was, it wasn't the same. 
Success bas taken its toll-in people who 
realized that the peace movement can 
mean political success, and jumped on its 
bandwagon for that reason, or in people 
who have been along for years, and are 
getting tired, for they have had to say 
the same things to the same people for a 
longtime.


In the end, though, Saturday wasn't the 
same because we'd all bad enough. After 
five years we have come to expect days 
like Saturday. We had nothing new to say 
because we'd been through it all so many 
times before. What was really unique 
about Saturday's march was that by now 
it had become so much a part of our 
routine.

**Title: Letter from Cambridge**

It is that time of year again when all of us-
Weatherman and fat cat, tailgater and 
acid freak-John Lennon tells us, should 
"come together right now" in unity of 
spirit. Sure we had our little misunder-
standing last week in Washington, but 
Saturday is the day of The Game, and even 
if it doesn't dawn clear and bright like 
it's supposed to, we are all Harvard men, 
we are all Yale men, to paraphrase some-
body. So the Crimson take on the Bulldogs 
and everybody cheers for their team.


But things are a little different this year; 
they have to be. Not even one of us is 
undefeated, and gone are Hill and Dowling 
and Gatto, and even "Frank Merriwell" 
Champi got sick of football and quit. But 
that's not all. Looking back on it, last 
year's game reminds one of the last drunk 
before the Great Crash or the final blazing 
frenzy before our Byronic hero succumbs 
to tuberculosis.


Okay. Joe Namath represents the Spock 
Generation and the Mets are the Charlie 
Browns of the world, so who's this guy who 
dies ofT.B., John Yovicsin? No, but you 
might say he's Harvard--or at least Nathan 
Pusey. Things are going to get worse be-
fore they get better, so in time of strife it 
might be comforting to play the record of 
last year's forty-two seconds or flip it over 
to be inspired by the Harvard Band. It is 
unlikely that another such triumphant 
moment-on whatever field of battle-is 
soon in coming.


For it is not only Harvard's football 
team that is in trouble, but the institution 
itself, and as its alumni stream into New 
Haven to cheer it on, they should perhaps 
stop for a moment and consider its 
achievements in some rather more impor-
tant respects. It is a truism in football that 
you don't win games on your reputation-
Yale discovered that last year-but it seems 
that Harvard learned nothing from its own 
team. It might be interesting at this point 
to make a few comparisons between Satur-
day's opponents in something other than 
total offense.


The most obvious difference is that a 
violent and disruptive confrontation took 
place here that bas no parallel in New 
Haven. Some might say this was due to 
differences among the two student bodies, 
but ultimately the burden of responsibility 
rests with those in power, namely the 
president of the university. It might be 
argued that this is merely a question of 
who is more adept at the art of cooptation, 
but events, it would seem clear, speak for 
themselves. It is no coincidence that King-
man Brewster has spared Yale from the 
dangers of polarization as Nathan Pusey 
could not at Harvard. Change seems to 
come slowly in Cambridge, and problems 
seem to remain covered over. A few 
examples:


The curriculum remains static. Despite 
the widespread changes at places such as 
Yale and Brown, Harvard retains the letter 
grading system and at the end of every 
semester ranks every undergraduate into 
one of five groups. Concentration and 
General Education requirements remain 
strict.


Course offerings can be sparse. Last year 
Harvard offered no introductory American
