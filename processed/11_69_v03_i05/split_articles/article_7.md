The Stones are Rolling 
.(and Rocking) Again 
by Patrick Lydon 
The Rolling Stones, who are currently on 
a national tour, will be performing 
at Madison Square Garden on No-
vember 27 and 28. The 35,000 seats for 
the performance were sold within three 
days. The following is an account of an 
appearance the Stones made before 
a record crowd last summer at Hyde 
Park in london. The author, Patrick 
Lydon, is a freshman in Morse College 
and has written for the New York Times 
and the Boston Globe. 

It was a beautiful day, it was a giant 
crowd, it was a great rock'n'roll band. 
The Rolling Stones's free concert last 
July was one of those very big events, 
those events which surprise everyone, 
where a situation arises which almost 
determines itself. Participants both do 
what is natural and feel that they are a 
part of something very much larger 
than themselves, something that they 
feel a personal affinity with and a 
loyalty to. In the end, it was Mick 
Jagger. 

Five thousand people came on Friday 
night and slept over so they would be 
right down in front of the huge stage. 
By 10:30 in the morning, there were 
50,000 people in the Cockpit in Hyde 
Park, a natural bowl facing the stage. 
When the Third Ear Band opened the 
show at 1:00, the crowd estimates were 
around 200,000. 

The crowd was infinitely exotic-
American tourists who read about the 
concert in the morning papers; secre-
taries sun-bathing in bikinis; hippies, 
smiling quietly, dressed in kaleidoscope 
color costumes; hippie girls in billowing 
angel robes, bits of Victorian lace and 
glittering Indian silver. Everywhere 
were the schoolboys in their weekend 
moddy gear and scruffy hair.lt was hard 
to tell who was hip and who was not 
because everyone looked weird. Maybe 
they were all hip that day. 

The Hell's Angels came from all over 
England for the show. They always find 
their way to a crowd, and they dig rock 
'n'roll. But when they arrived, the 
producers hired them as stewards, as 
policemen for the day. There were no 
more than a handful of london police 
there. The Angels came because they 
dug the Stones and because, "Mick 
Jagger, he's a rebel, too." But once they 
took their duties the object was "to 
prove that the Hell's Angels aren't just a 
bunch of fugs." They were proud that 
they didn't start tights. All afternoon 
they were helpful, rushing to rescue the 
girls that fainted and taking them to the 
first aid station and generally keeping 
order. Wild Child in his black leather 
jacket-painted on the back and studded 
on the front, under his Nazi helmet with 
swastikas painted on, behind his shades 
-he was in control of his troops. An 
organizer told him there was a crush on 
the left side of the stage. "Crush, what 
crush?" and he was off to uncrush what-
ever was there. He enjoyed being 
today's hero, but he understood he was 
there to protect the Stones. Hell's 
Angels replacing cops, rescuing faint-
ing girls, protecting expensive cameras 
- being proud of it. That makes a big 
day. 

Behind the stage the assorted stars 
waited with the friends of the Stones, 
eating cold ham and salad. Every face 
was somehow familiar. Ginger Baker 
was there with his wife and babies, The 
Incredible String Band, Donovan, Julie 
Felix, Marcia Hunt. John lennon meant 
to be there but had had a car accident 
only day~ before. Photographers 
roamed everywhere. 

It was a long afternoon. The crowds 
came early and the Stones weren't to be 
on until 5:20. But everyone was happy 
just to be there. The crowd rarely made 
any disturbance, digging most every-
thing that came by. The Third e., Band 
was followed by King Crimson. Screw 
came on next and then old rhythm 'n' 
blues man Alexis Korner. None of the 
bands did particularly well, but it was 
rockin' and funkin', and that is what 
counted. 

Family followed Alexis Korner, and 
they were good-very good. Roger 
Chapman, the lead singer, was at peak 
force, dancing wildly, smashing tam-
bourines. !n the crowd, a thin African 
boy rose up, jeans hanging from his 
waist, bare from there up but for 
an orange scarf around his head. He 
danced trancelike, body and arms jerk-
ing gently without form, without 
the dogmatic rhythm of American pop 
dancing yet with an implicit sense of the 
music. Someone below him blew soap 
bubbles, and he danced among them. 
Without ever moving his feet he was 
complete fluidity. He could have gone 
on forever. 

Farther back, another dancer stood 
up. A taller, stronger boy with shoulder 
length hair, he gracefully, relentless-
ly pounded the rhythm with his head, 
stretching his arms, twisting at the 
waist, writhing desperately, convulsed 
by the muscular effort and dripping 
with sweat in the hot sun. Another boy 
rose near him, and a red-dressed girl 
joined the African. It was the music, 
the sun 

While Pete Brown and the Battered 
Ornaments played the final set, the 
Stones arrived back stage in an armored 
truck. The Hell's Angels quickly gath-
ered around the back door of the truck 
to protect the band- but they slipped out 
the side before anyone could see them. 
For awhile, they stayed out of sight in a 
promotion trailer, but Jagger soon came 
to the door. Standing separated from 
everyone surging toward him, he was 
prettier than ever, smiling with a gentle 
contempt. Cameras shot from every 
d irection while the Mick licked his lips 
and puckered his huge grotesque 
mouth, showing it off for all the sex it is. 
He stood and blew kisses to the chickies, 
his lips hanging in their sullen pout. His 
hair seemed longer, parted in the 
middle, hanging softly on his shoulders. 
When he wanted to listen and talk, he 
did. "We're doing this today just be-
cause we wanna, man. We thought of it 
six weeks ago, and then after Blind 
F.ith did it we knew we just had to do it 
- it's such a gasss." (Jumpin-Jack Flash, 
such a gasss.) Someone asked about 
Brian Jones who split with the group a 
month earlier and who died only days 
before. "We really didn't know what to 
do, but I'm sure he's here just as much 
as we are." When he didn't feel like 
talking, he pretended not to hear. He 
seemed subdued, but he smiled, though 
always in spite, always tauntingly, 
daringly. He was high, it was his day 
for him to do his thing. By now four 
hundred thousand people were waiting 
for him, and he knew it. 

The moment the Battered Ornaments 
got off, excitement built quickly. The 
stage crew hurried to get the equipment 
arranged, the film crew in front of the 
stage made final preparations, the 
crowd stood to take its final stretch. The 
stage was beautiful, raised ten feet off 
the ground, covered with palm trees 
and jungle plants. Jagger had wanted 
parrots in the trees, but they weren't to 
be found in london. The announcer 
came on. He said that Mick wanted 
everyone to have a good time, but he 
wanted to read something in memory of 
Brian first. He wanted everyone to be 
quiet and listen-maybe they could just 
think about what has happened. 

And then he is on- the expected one 
has come. He is dressed all in white, 
white patent leather shoes, tight white 
linen trousers that are modestly flai red 
and a dazzling white tunic, ruffled at the 
collar and cuffs, with white frills down 
the front, tightly waisted with a hang-
ing skirt. He wears a black band with 
gold spangles around his neck. He 
comes alone to the mike and screams 
alright. "Alright, ... cool it for a min-
ute, because I really would like to say 
something about Brian. I don't know 
how to do this thing, but I'm gonna try 
... I'm just gonna say something that 
was written by Shelley." He pauses for 
a moment and there is a commotion 
beside the stage. He turns and screams, 
"look, just shut up and listen for a 
minute, OK?" It is a rebuke, not a re-
quest. 

Peace, peace! he is not dead, he doth not sleep-
He hath awakened from the dream of life-
'Tis we, who lost in stormy visions, keep 
With phantoms an unprofitable strife, 
And in mad trances, strike with our spirits' knife 
Invulnerable nothings.-We decay 
like corpses in a charnel; fear and grief 
Convulse us, and consume us day by day, 
And cold hopes swarm like worms w ithin our living 
clay. 

The One remains, the many change and pass; 
Heavens' light forever shines, Earth's shadows fly; 
Ufe, like a dome of many-coloured glass 
Stains the white radiance of Eternity, 
Until Death tramples it to fragments.-Oie, 
If thout wouldst be with that which thou dost seek! 
Follow where all is fled. 

He swaggers from the mike, drops 
his book next to the drums and waits 
for the band to get ready, radiating 
disgust and rejection. When they are 
ready, he comes to the mike and 
screams "alright" again-in provocation. 
He whines "OK." If he is alright, they 
had better be alright, too. He makes no 
effort to communicate-he defies the 
crowd, he scorns them, finally control-


ling them. When they are alright, he 
stalks back facing Watts, sets the band 
into a medium paced rock, gets his 
feeling, and he is off. He turns, leaps 
into the air and lands dancing, shaking, 
always moving. As he jumps, the stage 
crew lets out several thousand butter-
flies that flutter about him and all over 
the stage. He never lowers his head but 
stares and smiles-always letting people 
know that he is doing this for himself-
always letting them know that they 
cannot do it. Maybe he enjoys it because 
he can be the only one. 

He is a dancer beyond compare. He 
leaps and jumps; he sneers as he sings; 
he goes down low on his haunches like 
a small animal and sways. He prances 
from side to side, sets his hand on his 
hip and sells himself. He smooths his 
hair like a street-corner bitch, knowing 
he can be all woman and ever more a 
man. When he wants just to sing, he 
stands on the brink of the stage, slowly 
pumping his leg and swinging his arm, 
loosening up. He is all physical, yet 
there is nothing athletic about him. 

Some rock dancers do acrobatics-
Jagger is far smoother, far more subtle. 
He swings his arm because he feels it 
swinging. 

The rest of the band is obscured by 
his radiance; they just play on. Keith 
Richards, the lead guitar player, looks 
ill, doing his work without any expres-
sion. Wyman, the bass player, is blank 
too, as always. Jagger makes eyes at 
him, smiles and teases him. Wyman 
cracks an uncaring smile and looks 
away. Charlie Watts, the bone-faced 
drummer, smiles the same catlike grin 
that he always has. He drums with 
authority yet calm, nearly hidden by 
palm trees. Mick Taylor, the recent 
replacement for Brian Jones, looks too 
young, too excited. He isn't used to 
being a Rolling Stone, and he smiles too 
often. But he is learning. 

Jagger moves through the songs, 
screaming between them. "Alright . . . 
Alright ... Are you havin' a good 
time?" He yells as if the park would be 
wiped out if they weren't. It is a good 
time, and he moves on. They do hits and 
old favorites, "Jumpin-Jack Flash," 
"Mercy, Mercy," "Stray Cat Blues," 
"Down Home Girl." But it is all Jagger. 
The band is sluggish. They are the 
familiar thumping, pumping Stones-
maybe more guitar playing from 
Richards and Taylor-but they aren't 
swinging; the music won't come out. 
Jagger is limitless, and no band is going 
to bring him down, but they aren't 
taking him any higher. He whines at 
them, "let's get the tempo together-
c'mon, some tempo." In some spots the 
group really stumbles, transitions are 
weak, and Mick has to look back to see 
where they are. But he doesn't really 
need them. 

He really doesn't need anything. He 
takes off his tunic to show a pale-green 
T-shirt with no sleeves at all, his long 
thin muscular arms drooping, his 
medals dangling. His arms are striped 
with thick veins. He swaggers, some-
times going back and standing facing 
Watts, just tapping his foot, knowing 
he controls the show with his backside. 
Unlike a singer/ dancer like Janis 
Jopin, one never feels he is dancing 
because he has to get his inner energy 
and fury out in the air. He is pas-
sionate yet cold. He doesn't need 
to express his soul. He is there be-
cause he loves having 400,000 peo-
ple see him twitch; he loves to twitch 
just because he doe.s it so well- he 
almost giggles with pleasure that 
he can be so sexy. At the end of sev-
eral songs he walks quietly, slowly 
twirling his fingers around each other 
for all to see. Nothing is so beautiful 
to him than to twirl his futile fingers. 
He does it because no one else could 
dare. No one else could ma.ke it so 
mean and sinister. No, he needs 
nothing. 

And he can show that he is the best 
blues singer in England when he moans 
"love in Vain," an old Robert Johnson 
number. He finishes that, "Oh, yeaahh, 
I hate yuh!", with nasty satisfaction. 
"We're gonna do some stuff off of 
our new album," he whines," .. which 
is gonna be released in about . .. ten 
years' time." 

The new Jagger songs have all his 
defiance. "Gimme a little Drink" starts 
" I'm the man on the mountai~ome on up. 
I'm a ploughman in the valley with a faceful of 
mud. 
I'm in a hurry, and I know my car was stuck." 

There is intense frustration in many 
of his lyrics-real despair blues frustra-
tion, and that is part of his suI len ness, 
too. The stanzas he chose from Shelley 
were the most dark and pessimistic 
in the whole poem. He left out those 
that spoke of future joy. Maybe it is the 
ultimate despair of that poem that his 
hate grows in. His mood is a strange 
combination of bitterness, much hate, 
frustration and defiance, yet he is the 
sweet star, too, and he loves every bit 
of his sour soul. Everything in him says 
he is the prettiest, the sexiest, and the 
meanest he could be. But he is rotting 
inside. He must have accepted that 
"we are all decaying like corpses in a 
charnel" and taken it to heart. He can 
hate everyone and himself and take 
pleasure in his disgust. He cherishes 
all the evil that he is. 

The longest new song is "The Mid-
night Rambler"-he's a gambler and a 
creep and defeated, but he is holy, too. 
Singing, he kneels and crouches down, 
peering out. "I am the midnight raper, 
striking in anger." He bursts up, slash-
ing the stage with his heavy belt. He 
is wild," . . . the midnight strangler, I 
did it in Boston." He threatens and 
cowers together, he is the jungle cat 
that strikes in furious fear- it is in his 
eyes and mouth and smooth arms. 

Finally they get into "Satisfaction", 
and the crowd is wild. People start 
dancing to save themselves; hundreds 
rise to their shaking feet, and then 
everyone is standing and shouting and 
clapping. Jagger dances with utter 
joy: the crowd is so bad-he is laughing 
at them all. He is prissy for a moment, 
...
