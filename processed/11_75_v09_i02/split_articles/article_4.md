Death and Taxes 
(continu~d from page I ) 
Scholarship His first job was with 
White & Chase, a large, co~ative 
New Y ark law ftnn. In 1960, Mr. 
MacBride moved to Halifax, Vermont, 
where he was elected to the State 
Legislature. During this period he ran in 
the Republican Gubnatorial Primary, 
but received only a quarter ot the vote. 
In 1972, a four-year resident of 
Charlottesville, Virginia, he was chosen 
Presidential Elector. At the convention 
he cast his ballot for John Hospers and 
Tonie Narhan, Libertarian candidates for 
President. This so infuriated the other 
Virginians that some of them will not 
speak to him today. 

Anarchists and libertarians are opti-
mists in the sense that they count on 
personal generosity to pad the free 
market system. Institutionalized charity 
in the fonn of Welfare, tax 
deductions, and government subsidies 
discourage individuals from public 
spirited donations . .. The nineteenth 
century was America's greatest time of 
charity, because the wealthy wanted to 
help. They weren't forced by their 
government, •• says Mr. MacBride. 

Some extreme Libertarians would like to 
see the government's costs paid only by 
donation. They point out that it would . 
quickly eliminate officious bureaucracy. 
.. We don't need a Post Office! The 
printe companies which delivered 2nd 
class· maiJ do it much quicker and more 
efficiently. So take it out of the 
Government's hands. We don't need 
public highways! The way things are 
now, people who never drive pay taxes 
for whose who do. If you want to use a 
road, pay for it on the spot. And you 
can bet the roads will be kept up. 
Competition will see to that." 

1be present staff of the National 
Libertarian headquarters in Washington 
numbers three. His own staff is not 
much larger. Roger MacBride compares 
himself to the fable of the tortoise and 
the hare. He says that he can't afford to 
run big, so he campaigns quietly over 
an extended period. There are repre-
sentatives of the Libertarian party in 
about 45 states. 

He feels his campaign has already 
been injured by Capitol Hill ... You 
know that ruling they made after 
Watergate about matching campaign 
donations? WeU, it only applies to the 
two major parties. That means we have 
to earn twice as much money as the Big 
Guns to have the same to spend. 

Roger MacBride's philosophical 
stance falls within the mainstream of the 
Chicago School though he is vehement-
ly opposed to a negative income tax. 
··That is still playing with people's 
lives. Taking money from the rich to 
specifically give to the poor is playing 
Robin Hood." Libertarians consider 
Robin Hood to be the greatest economic 
villain to hit the books since the Roman 
bread and circuses alternative to govern-
ment. 

He favors instead a simple graduate 
income tax with absolutely no loop-
holes. "Sure this means that Howard 
Hughes will pay 200 million dollars a 
year instead of two million, but even his 
net loss won't be that great. Without 
loopholes. there will no longer be an 
incentive for bad business. Hughes can 
stop pouring money down dty oil 
wells." 

Before Mr. MacBride can reduce taxes 
substantially he wants to pay the entire 
National Debt and gently remove most 
Federal bureaucracy. " But by the end 
of a four year term, we could have 
taxes. pretty damn low. One big factor, 
besides all that money we won't have to 
pour into Farm Aid and Defense and 
Welfare, will be the elimination of the 
Federal Reserve Board. •• 

.. This country doesn't need a state 
bank. 1llat was Alexander Hamilton's 
idea. He realized that he wasn't going 
to get economic support for his new 
government unless he controlled the 
cash flow. Jackson saw what a mess 
that had made, and he abolished the 
State Bank when he got into office. 
Paid the national debt too. His term was 
economically a lot more sound than ours 
is. •• 

He fervently favors the legalization of 
marijuana, even though he believes that 
a University of California at Berkeley 
professor has conclusively demonstrate 
that the drug causes irrepairable br:ain 
damage. People's lives are their own, 
and the Government, once again, has no 
right to tell them what to do. Nor 
sliOuJd the Govenment try to warn 
people about marijuana's dangers. The 
F.D.A . is a regulatory agency whose 
function can be taken over by the press. 
If a newspaper wants to sell copies, it is 
in their interest to inform. 

''Tile press has been a big help. Free 
advertising. They like independent 
thinkers. We make good copy." Nicolas 
von Hoffman, the Washington Post's 
resident maverick, calls Libertarians 
' 'the only people worth voting for." 

Dan Rather has also given Mr. 
MacBride good coverage; much better, 
surprisingly. than Mr. MacBride has 
received at the hands of the old line 
conservatives. William Buckley's Nat-
iotUJI Review consistantly ignores the 
Ubertarian party movement. Mr. 
MacBride contends it is because 
Buckley recognises that the Libertarian 
Party has aU the answer-s. 

''1be Republican party is dead. It's a 
huge decaying elephant. By 1980, it 
will no longer be a political force. 
That • s when Libertarianism saeps in. 
This country was made for a two party 
system. We will be the second party. 
Wallace isn't a threat because he 
doesn't have an original platform. 
We' ve got the ideas. Every forty years 
or so, a new political philosophy or 
independent thinker comes on the scene. 
Jackson, Roosevelt, we're the next!"

**Any Woman Can**

hear an explanation of the abortion 
proCedure. Then she must wait again for 
a physical and a session with a 
counselor. If she has decided to have 
the abol.tion, she is asked to return in 
the afternoon for a ''birth control 
lecture. " At this group session, women 
are helped to evaluate the effectiveness 
of different methods of birth control. 
After several hours, the abortion is 
performed. Aftt:-wards the patient waits 
in a "recovery room" for 30 minutes 
and then goes home. The clinic staff 
prefers that someone comes to meet the 
woman, husband, lover, parents or a 
friend. 

Women's Health Services is markedly 
different. 1be staff takes particular care 
to make women feel at ease, since many 
are young and apprehensive. There are 
plenty of magazines to read, and a pot 
of hot water surrounded by instant 
coffee, tea, cups, and cookies. One of 
the reasons for its relaxed atmosphere is 
that W .H.S. handles only 24 abortions 
per week, as opposed to at least double 
that number at Sterling. 

First, the woman is examined by a 
physician's associate. As soon as there 
are three or four women ready, they are 
gathered for a group information se:.sion 
that includes an explanation of the 
procedure. display of the instruments to 
be used and the lecture on birth control. 
This last is the most entertaining feature 
of the session, thanks to .. The Birth 
Control Cranky,'' a gadget similar to a 
player piano roll with pictures. The 
cranky and its accompanying narration 
by a staff member begins: .. There are all 
kinds of ways to show aff~on; some 
peoole hold hands, some people kiss, 
and some people make love. If you 
decide to make love, then you need to 
understand more about getting preg-
nant." The cranky goes on to dispel 
myths about pregnancy and examines 
various methods of birth control. 

After the session, blood is taken and 
other laboratory tests are run. The 
woman then gets a chance to speak with 
a counselor who answers any questions 
she might have. She then makes an 
appointment for the next day. When she 
arrives on the following day. the same 
woman who coonseled her is there to 
meet her. The staff member stays with 
her throughout the procedure and in the 
recovery room until she's ready to go 
home. Two weeks after the abortion, 
the woman comes in again for a 
follow-up examination. At that time, the 
patient is provided with a pr-eliminary 
supply of whatever birth control method 
she has decided to use. In the case of 
IUD's, they are inserted at this time. 

One of the women interviewed for 
this article said that the issue of abortion 
in New Haven was diiectJy related to 
the issue of health care in New Haven. 
Indeed, the issue of health care is being 
focussed on almost everywhere in the 
country. With this attention comes an 
increased willingness on the part of the 
consumer to question existing programs 
and create new ones when the old ones 
are found deficient. Despite varying 
ideologies, women in New Haven are 
being given a choice, and that is a 
hopeful sign.
