''Buddy, can you spare a 
dime?" 
"Hey ... Everybody gather 'round. I 
wanna tell ya somethin'! No, not just 
you two. C'mon, everybody. Yeah ... 
That's right. 
" I just wanna know if any of you 
nice folks could help Brother John out 
with some spare change." That's 
Brother John. He has been around for 
such a long time that giving him money 
has become a Yale tradition. Everyone 
has Brother John stories to tell. l've 
heard rumors that Brother John uses the 
money he makes to go to Florida every 
winter, that he's the leader of the 
bicycle theft ring of New Haven, and 
that he's offered to make change for a 
$ 10 bill in order to get a quarter. 
l saw Brother John and he asked for 
some change. I showed him that 1 had 
only a nickel. Brother John explained 
that he doesn't take nickels on 
principle-"lf you only have a nickel 
you better keep it yourself. I'm not that 
desperate." Then he asked if I had any 
spare bills. Before I knew what 
happened I had put a dollar in his hand. 
We sat down to do the interview right 
there in front cf Pierson by the light of 
the streetlamp. 
Q. What's you real name and where 
do you live? 
A . "My name is Kenneth Jones. I've 
Jived in a room at I 142 Chapel St. for 6 
months.,. Brother John moves fre-
quently because of " landlord hassles." 
He was born and raised in New Haven 
and says that he has never been out of 
the city in his life. He is 31 years old. 
Q. How long have you been asking 
students for money? 
A . "Oh ... many a year." Later on. 
he said he thought he'd been pan-
handling for five years. He's probably 
worked longer, though. One professor 
said she came to Yale 7 years ago and 
Brother John was going strong then. 
Q. Where do you panhandle? 
A. "Oh ... I go everywhere. Broad-
way is a good spot. But those colored 
guys who sell that Black Muslim paper 
and ask for donations take business 
away from me. " In the mornings 
Brother John sits near Berkeley College 
and CCL to catch students as they are 
walking to their classes. Later. he goes 
to the Chapel Square Mall area.


Evenings he sits in front of Pierson 
College, because ''that's where the 
prettiest girls walk." 
Q. Who do you panhandle from? 
A. "Oh, everybody." He asks New 
Haven residents as well as Yalies but he 
..gets most money from Yalies." He 
said that he asks boys more often than 
girls because he's afraid he might scare 
the girls. "The old freshmen. you 
know, the ones that come back every 
year give me more money than the new 
freshmen. The new freshmen don •t 
know me yet." 
Q. How much money do you make 
and what do you do with it? 
A. Brother John chuckled. " I guess 1 
make about $10 every couple of 
hours. " Once he mentioned that he 
made $30 a day. Later on, though, he 
showed me his wallet. He had collected 
$ 18 in 4 hours that evening. He said 
that weeknights like this are usually 
slow· On weekends he sees more 
Yalies. He spends his money on food 
and liquor. 
Q. Where do you eat? 
A. " I only eat one meal a day-at 
midnight." Each night, during the week 
Brother John has a salad and a slice of 
pizza at Mama's Pizza. He drinks about 
$25 worth of beer and liquor each day. 
He celebrates the weekends by eating 
sausage and pepper subs at Broadway 
Pizza and drinking at Rudy's. He said 
that sometimes he doesn't have enough 
money to eat so he goes to bed on an 
empty stomach-only full of liquor that 
is. 
Q. Do you have any other sources of 
income? 
A. "I get $25 a week from welfare 
for my rent. From unemployment, I get 
$98 every 2 weeks." Brother John has 
held many odd jobs ever since he quit 
school in the tenth grade. Last year he 
worked in a pillow factory for 9 
months. "I quit because the boss got on 
my nerves " Brother John says that 
he'd rather work than panhandle. He is 
ashamed to ask people for money but 
many jobs just · 'don"t pay enough 
money " This September he got a job 
as a utility man at Southern Connecticut 
State College but it only lasted one da)' 
··My finger got infected the first day 
and I forgnt to call in about it, .. he 
explained. Brother John i~ now looking 
for a job and as soon as he find' one 
he'Jl st0p panhandling. 
If Brother John can't find a JOb 
soon. he says he may move to Ne~ 
York. "But without me who would 
make kids happy? I love all Yalies. I 
thinlc thPv ~re all nice oeoole and I like 
talking with them." Even if Brother 
John goes to New York for the rest of 
his life, he says he wants to return to be 
buried in the Grove Street cemetary. 
"I'll want Yalies to come to my grave 
and drop spare change on it." 


**Title: Just what this country needs-more answers**
**Author: Rochelle Sharpe**

Just what this country needs-
more answers 
''What this country needs is a 
good socialist youth movement" pro-
claimed posters announcing a confer-
ence to be held at Harvard University's 
Science Center sponsored by the 
Democratic Socialist Organizing Com-
mittee. We were ready to learn about 
this country's socialist youth movement, 
but we found no one answering the 
description. 
Jumble and confusion dommated the 
scene of regtstration in the lobby. To 
register, one wrote one's name, address 
and degree of interest in socialism on a 
file card. We seemed to be the only 
ones registering, although lots of people 
stood nearby. 
Once we had sorted out the fringe 
elements in the lobby- the women 
peddling feminist newspapers, the "Free 
the Prisoners of the Shah" table, and 
the people campaigning for Fred 
Harris--we found three main socialist 
movements represented. 
One, the Democratic Socialist Organ-
izing Committee (DSOC). sponsored the 
conference. This national organization 
works "for full equality for all 
Americans, a goal which can only be 
realized if the social structure and the 
economy are democratized along with 
the political system." DSOC deals with 
the existing American political system 
to change it, especially by campaigning 
in elections for socialists or candidates 
sympathetic to socialism. Members of 
DSOC who spoke at the conference 
that week included the organization's 
chairman Michael Harrington (author of 
The Other America and The Accidental 
Century), and Dorris Bunte, Massachu-
setts' state representative from Boston. 
The DSOC invited the New American 
Movement to represent itself at the 
conference. Its newspaper explains, 
.. NAM exists to help organize a 
a movemt!nt for democratic socialism in 
the United States. At this point in 
-history, the socialist movement is not 
best served by individual acts of 
revolutionary violence, but by the 
quieter heroism of local organizing.· • 
Members spoke from the NAM view-
point at the workshops, and kept a 
registration table at the lobby. 
Last, but loudest, were members of 
the Sparticist Youth League, who 
describes themselves as "the youth 
section of the Sparticist League, a 
revolutionary organization which inter-
venes in social struggles armed with a 
workmg class program, based on the 
politics of Marx, Lenin, and Trotsky.·· 
They seemed to have come as self-
appointed opposition to the other 
soctaliM groups. It was not clear if they 
had been invited to distribute their 
literature at the conference, but during 
the cour":>e of the workshops it became 
obvious that they practiced strategies of 
infiltration and takeover of discussion 
groups. 
The clearest explanation we heard of 
t~e relations among the: three organiza-
t10ns came trum a member of NAM, 
who said, "No lefust group likes to 
think there is another group farther to 
the left. But, if you thmk in terms of a 
balance between immediate social issues

Nice, 76 Degrees, Clear 
Is what it will read in the Times tomorrow. 
This, the underside of the palm leaf 
where a shadow 
circumscribes the crowd along the road 
with certainty. 
It is all very important 
what we do here. 
It is all very clear. 
It is printed all over our shirts 
and our smiles, 
our sunglasses 
behind which the eye masquerades 
in optimal view of the distant world. 
There is no danger of engagement. 
The light reveals only 
itself, on the thousands of exposures today, 
as always, 
when the film is washed 
the plant in the garden will have already borne its fruit 
and the gargoyles will have a new family to entertain. 
It is just common knowledge. 
The terrazzo man pissing eternally 
into the pool where we 
watch ourselves laugh.

Oaibome long time food and 
beverage editor of the New York 
Times drinks La Vleflle Ferme as 
his daily wine. Terry Roberds on 
his WQXR wine Show singled It out 
as the best red wine 1o buy for 
everyday use. 
The quality comes from the 
grape. Unlike many other Co1es du 
Rhones, La Vleflle Ferme uses a 
high ratio of Petit. Syrah rather 
than the more COl I I I 1011 Gre"lBChe 
of the area. The actvnage of USing
