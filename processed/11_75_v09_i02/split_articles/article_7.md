Any Woman Can 
Have an Abortion 
But do we need to feel like bad girls if we do? 
c c:~e

Co~necticut is threatening women's 
rights to abortion. Governor Ella 
Grasso, a Roman Catholic is a dedicated 
member of the .. pro-life" ranks. The 
Connecticut General Assembly is in the 
proces$ of restricting the access of some 
women to abortion with the requirement 
of the consent of the father. 'The 
Connecticut Welfare Department has 
been notified that they are no longer 
allowed to cover the cost of an abortion 
as part of their services, a directive 
which places the added burden of 
medical oills on women who are least 
able to pay. 
Abortions have always been legal, but 
until 1972 when the U.S. Supreme court 
ruled abortion laws unconstitutional thev 
were performed only under certain 
conditions. A woman had to prove that 
her physical or emotional well-being 
would be endangered by the birth of a 
child. Only Yale-New Haven Hospital 
performed abortions in New Haven. 
Examinations by two psychiatrists and 
two gynecologists were required to 
prove a pregnancy dangerous. The 
patJent paid for these examinations 
herself. If their recommendations did not 
pass a committee at Yale-New Haven 
her investment was lost. The abortion 
itself, incurred an additional cost of 
$230 or tnore, if she bad reached .the 
second twelve weeks of pregnancy . 
In 1969, a group ot professionals 
from the Departments of Obstetrics and 
Gynecology, Psychiatry, and Social 
Work at Yale-New Haven met to 
:>rganize a service that would provide 
support tor women through the crisis of 
pregnancy. This group undec the 
direction of Dr. Nathan Kase, Chairman 
:>f the Department of Obstetrics and 
Gynecology was named Family Advis-
ory Counseling and Treatment Service. 
The program opened officially in 1970. 
Though hospital sources were extremely 
reluctant to admit it, one of the reasons 
F .A.C.T.S . was formed was to increase 
the availability of abortions for women 
by helping them to comply with the 
state codes concerning their emotional 
stability. 
F.A .C.T.S. wished to keep a low 
profile to remain an effective advocate 
for their patients. In some cases, 
the financial strain placed on the woman 
was almost unbeanlble. F.A.C.T .S. tried 
to arrange alternative methods of 
payment. In other cases, young women 
would find themselves pressured into 
having an abortion when they were 
strongly in favor of keeping the child. 
Here, F .A.C. T.S. tried to act in their 
behalf to eUminate the tension between 
the women and therr tanuttes. Utten 
they helped plan for the SUJ??Ort" of the 
child. F .A.C .T .S. attempted to provide 
marital and sexual counseling as weU. 
Yale and New Haven women inde-
pendant of Yale-New Haven Hospital 
(Y-NHH) began working with this 
problem at the same time. 1be New 
Haven Women's Center was one of 
several feminist organizations in the city 
that began defending the right of 
women to control their own bodies.

the implausibility of the plan and 
pointed out the dangers of complica-
tions. Dr. Kase resigned frrst, followed 
by others. One of the members, in 
looking back, speculated as to the cause 
of the resignations: ' 'It had to do with 
power. The W.A.R.S . proposal was a 
challenge to Yale-New Haven as one of 
the most prestigious member'S of the 
American medical community. 1be idea 
of women getting together and establish-
ing a clinic without the sanction of the 
male medical profession was an ego-
hlow. "

Meanwhile, women were taking the 
issue to the courts. Kathy Emmett, a 
Yale Law School graduate, challenged 
the Connecticut abortion laws by filing 
a class action suit. lllousands of women 
became plaintiffs in Women vs. Con-
necticut, and Ms. Emmett argued the 
·case before the Connecticut Supreme 
Court. About the same time, the United 
States Supreme Court ruled that abortion 
laws were unconstir..1tional . 
The Supreme Court's decision in 1972 
eliminated the necessity for psychia-
tric/gynecologjcal consultation, and for 
the decision committee at Y-NHH. Dr. 
Kase chose shortly afterwards to form a 
' 'community board of directors'' to talce 
responsibility for the F.A.C.T .S . clinic, 
now that they could publicly aclcnowl-
edge the existence of such a clinic. 
W .A.R.S. discovered the existlence of 
the board by accident and invited 
themselves to the next meeting. It was 
suggested that members of W .A.R :~ · be 
allowed to sit on the board. In addJbon, 
Dr. Virginia Stuermer, a colleague of 
Dr. Kase at Y-NHH was nominated to 
the board of directors. According to a 
former W.A.R.S . member, .. Tile sug-
gestion was sort of balked at, but they 
finally agreed. In return, we made a 
vague sort of promise to refer a certain 
number of patients to the F.A.C.T.S. 
clinic. We never did, though." 
Some of the W .A.R.S . women were 
skeptical about the motives of Dr.Kase 
for providing this service, believing he 
was simply out for the money the 
serv1ce brought to the Department of 
Obstetrics and Gynecology. 'They poin-
ted out that all abortions were done at 
Y-NHH by faculty of the Yale Medical 
School for very high prices. Other 
members of the board frrmly believed 
that his actions reflected his real 
concern over the issue of abortion in 
New Haven. 
These conflicting views resulted in 
friction betwcenn the W.A.R.S. group 
After the resJgnattons, the remaJrung 
members of the group began plans for 
an outpatient abortion clinic. One of the 
first actions acided representatives from 
Fiar Haven Clinic, Hill Health Center 
and Family Planning to the board of 
directors. The group hired Harriet 
Bogard, a lawyer and founder of 
Dixwell Legal Rights to help with the 
fund-raising campaigns. Dr. Virginia 
Stuermer, 8l' original board member and 
the only gynecologist left in the 
organization was appointed medical 
director. Tbey sought additional medical 
personnel. During this period members 
of the board approached doctors in the 
community and received intially positive 
responses. When contacted again, these 
same doctors expressed reluctance and 
finally refused outright. Women in the 
project at that time said that the 
doctor's refusal was linked to the 
response of Y -NHH to their affiliation 
with the splinter group. No doctor can 
practice without hospital _affiliation and 
this privilege can be rescmded by_ the 
hospital for reasons of •unprotesstanal 
conduct.' 
Finally, almost 2 years after the board 
split, Women's Health Services opened 
on the second floor of the 
renovated Firehouse 19 on Edwards 
Street off State. 1be aim of W.H.S. is 
to provide diagnosis of pregnancy, 
counseling and abortion during the first 
I I weeks. A group affiliated with 
W.H.S., Women's Health Education, 
offers a series of courses on ··women 
and our Bodies", that deal with 
menstruation, sexuality and women and 
health care, among other topics. 
Both Women's Health Services and 
F.A.C.T.S.(which has since been re-
named the Sterling Clinic) use the 
vacuum aspiration method of abortion, 
considered the safest and most 
simple procedure available. After a local 
anesthetic has been injected into the 
cervix, the os, or opening of the cervix 
is gently stretched with a series of 
dilators until it can accomodate the 
insertion of a blun~-tipped tube about the 
size of a fountain pen. This tube is a 
vacuum cunette, and is attached to a 
suction machine, or aspirator. The 
aspirator works like a vacuum cleaner, 
emptying the contents of the uterus. The 
proced~ its:elf takes anywhere from 3 
minutes tO a maximum of ·J 0 minutes. 
Afterwards, an ordinary cunette may be 
used to scrape the walls of ~ 
uterus 
and check for any tissue that the 
aspirator may have missed. 
The cost of this procedure is $165 at 
Sterling Clinic. The fee includes lab 
work, a complete physical, contracep-
tion information counseling and the 
abortion itself. At Women's Health 
Services, the cost is $125 and includes 
lab work, physical, counseling, birth 
control information and supplies, the 
abortion, a RboGam injection if the 
mother is RH positive, and a follow-up 
exam two weeks after the procedure is 
performed. 
Payment for the procedure at Sterling 
and W.H.S. is covered by Medicaid, 
CMS, and specified bealtb insurance 
plans. In addition, the Connecticut 
Feminist-Federal Credit Union offers 
loans to women who need abortions and 
plan to have them at W .H.::>. 
The Sterling clinic, located on 
Congress A venue across from the 
hospital, is painted in hospital colors. 
The patient is admitted to the building 
by a buzzer and her name checked off a 
list. She is asked for a urine sample, 
then led to a waiting room where she is 
handed some forms to complete. One is 
a medical history, the other is a 
questionnaire, designed to act as a guide 
for social workers. She answers ques-
tions such as ••What method of birth 
control were you using when you 
became pregnant?," .. Have you ever 
made a suicide attempt?," .. How sure 
are you that you want an abortion?" 
She waits there until her name is called, 
when she joins a group of women to
