Sprocket holes: Audiences 
· You're engrossed in the climactic 
moments of a thriller, having escaped 
successfully enough to blot out most of 
the real world, when the jerk three seats 
down from you, who's with a group of 
six, each of whom has enjoyed the party 
before more than the movie they're at 
now, and who have been joking and 
giggling at all the worst times to be 
annoying but you've sublimated them 
for the most part till now, when this 
jerk says, "Oh I've seen 
this! She stabs him and then falls off the 
roof with the kid hanging on the fire 
escape!" Ten minutes later that is of 
course what happens on the screen, but 
it's no surprise to you. And the final 
grief is the admonition on the poster 
1"Please do not reveal the ending." 
Sigh. 

Until 1950 or so, nobody saw 
n;tovies alone. But even though televi-
sron bas changed our viewing habits, 
rums are still generally considered a 
group experience, a social phenomenon. 
We still " go to the movies." As with 
most such experiences, there is a unique 
interaction and behavior accomoany-
ing the event. And as with most human 
behaviour, a lot of what goes on at the 
movies in the audience is, well, screwy. 

Underlining everything is the notion 
that, in a movie audience, you are in a 
gropp but you are alone. If your 
attention is on tbe screen, a reaction 
from the audience beyond yourself is 
always unexpected, an extra dimension 
of the experience. The communication in 
a theater is directly between the screen 
and the individual viewer-any other 
communication is not overtly conscious, 
initially. (This assumes attention to the 
screen; dating couples function differ-
ently, and in some theaters you can't 
see the screen from the back row 
anyway.) The fact of the group reaction 
external to your own explains some 
obvious results: comedies are better in a 
crowded theater, sad or melodramatic 
movies are best in solitude, scary 
movies best in an alert crowd, etc. 

Laughter is contagious, so you laugh 
harder and more often with people 
laughing around you, while it only takes 
one schmuck giggling at the wrong time 
to destroy the lump in your throat. 

Specifically, everyone loves to cheer 
collectively in Casablanca, at the 
beginning of a beautiful friendship. On 
the other hand, a projectionist friend of 
mine once refused to continue a 
screening of A Streetcar Named Desire 
bec~':lse a bunc.h .creeps were laughing 
dens1vely at VIvien Leigh's break-
down as Blanche. 

Public audiences rarely complain, no 
matter what goes wrong. An extreme 
example is the following episode. The 
commercial projectionist union has a lot 
of old men in it. They tend to fall 
asleep. So I'm ·sitting in a moderately 
crowded theater, and the light on the 
screen begins to dim, flickering dim-
ming. I am aware that the arc rods in 
the projector need adjusting, and soon, 
or the screen will go black. It does. 
Nobody moves in the audience. Nobody 
moves in the projection booth. For five 
minutes. the crowd listens to the movie, 
in pitch darkness. The one hears the reel 
end, the film run out of the projector. 
stop. Now the theater is dark and silent. 
For a good ten minutes, nobody did 
nothing, except murmur quietly and 
shuffle their feet. My fascination with 
this phenomenon wearing off, I got up 
and fouDd the manager, who didn't 
seem t<?O surprised that the house was 
dark. But can you imagine that 
happening with a college audience? 

College audiences never hesistate to 
communicate information to the projec-
tionist, sometimes before the movie 
starts. 

College crowds can also make a bad 
movie a lot more fun, with a few choice 
comments at appropriate times often 
improving the script. Try out a boring 
porno movie with a horny college 
audience. It can be an education on 
several levels. 

Scary movies with a college bunch on 
the same wavelength can be great. At a 
crowded screening of Night of the Living 
Dead, a guy was sitting next to an 
attractive girl he didn't know. In a tense 
moment of the film, the girl suddenly 
grabbed the guy's ann. gripping it 
tightly for quite a while. After the film 
was over, I asked him if he liked it. 
"Are you kidding? I've got her phone 
number. and I'm staying for the next 
show.'' A group of people were sitting 
m two rows, and m another particularly 
tense scene, a guy reached over the 
back of the chair in front of him slowly 
touching the occupant's shoulde; The 
poor girl jumped about four feet in all 
directions, as did the people around her.
