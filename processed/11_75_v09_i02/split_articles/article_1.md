The National Libertarian Party is a 
new politicaJ party in an old tradition. 
Libertarians, sometimes called Anarcho-
Capitalists or Objectivists, believe that 
unobstructed free market capitalism will 
solve America's ills. The party was 
fonned in J 97 I and presently numbers 
approximately five thousand members. 
This year. for the fli'St time, they are 
running a Libertarian candidate for 
President. His name is Rogtt MacBride, 
and he expects to win at least a million 
votes. The size of Mr. MacBride's party 
does not worry him because anarchy is 
the purest form of Libertarianism, and 
Libertarians are not apt to join anything. 


Many libertarians do not consider 
Roger MacBride a Libertarian at all. 
They point out that he wants a salaried 
state job wh~n some Libertarians feel 
that all civil service should be 
voluntary. Libertarians disagree with 
each other as much as they disagree 
with the American government. They 
view America as both an Imperialist and 
a Welfare state. Most would be hard put 
to say which is worse. 


At the core of Libertarian philosophy 
is the concept that every individual has 
an absolute moral right to his own 
body . .. Self Ownership" means that no 
man or group may trespass upon 
another's personal freedom . To make 
this work, man's right to the ownership 
and disposition of any goods he earns, 
fmds, or creates must be inviolable. 
TbeoreticaJJy all property is private and 
may be exchanged at will. 


Fragmentation begins with the ques-
tions of implication and implementation. 
At the University of Chicago, weU-
known Libertarian economists such as 
Milton Friedman and the late Henry 
Simon created an economic ideology of 
Libertarianism. Some ideas of .. The 
Chicago School" evoke controvttsy 
even within the party. They advocate-
among other things-voluntary educa-
tion, which would involve closing the 
public school system because education 
is a personal, familial responsibility; 
dismantling the court system ahd 
substitution of private arbitration com-
panies; and legalization of the so-called 
" victimless" crimes. 


lbe Chicago School supports the 
foUowing arguments in conjunction with 
most Libertarians: 
Abolish all Governnumt Regulatory 
Agencies 
The consumer alone must protect 
himself, because the Government has no 
business intervening in his choice of 
what to buy or how to live. Libertarians 
reason that a company which poUutes in 
great quantity will eventually drive its 
workers away. It will prefer to clean up 
rather than close down. 


. This policy includes severe limitation 
or dissolution of the Federal Reserve 
Board, which places artificial restric-
tions on the flow of money, and thus 
obstructs the free market. 


Libertarians object to more than the 
goals of the Regulatory Agencies. They 
see them as hotbeds of bure&Jcratic 
waste. Milton Friedman has said that 
bureaucracy self-perpetuates endless} y, 
and that it is a parasite on the American 
public.

I'm running TofPresident of the 
United States. 
People say only two things 
are inevitabl~. 
Death and taxes. 
They're wrong.

Throw Welfare out with its siblings 
Social Security, Public Housing, and 
Redevelop1111!nt 
The protective government is 1be 
intrusive government. Welfare, as it 
works today. discourages individual 
effort. Friedman does say that if the 
poor must have help, cut out the 
program and just give them the money 
directly. He postulates a negative 
income tax where everyone who earned 
below a certain sum would receive a flat 
subsidy. Republicans froth at the mouth 
when they hear this. 


Public housing and Redevelopment 
are a mess. Remember the Model Cities 
Program fiasco in the 60's? Let 
someone tum a buck renovating the 
inner city. Personal economic incentive 
is the only thing that will keep it 
n::novated. 


Social Security forces people to take 
out Government retirement insurance. In 
essence, the Govecnment forces its 
taxpayers to loan it money ar a 
non-competitively low interest rate. Jf 
people wish to plan ahead, private 
companies have shown they can give a 
better deal. 


Protect business from government 
intervention: No more Minimum Wage. 
Tarrif and Trade Quotas, Price Sup-
ports, or Licensing 
When will people learn that busi-
nesses will only hire whom they need? 
The whole economy is hurt when 
Businesses can't afford to increase 
production by hiring more people. 


Abolition of tarrifs means trade with 
anyone of any ideology who wants 
American products. Conservatives rage 
and Big Business is even less happy. 
Trade quotas function like polite 
Government contracts to protect Wash-
ington's favorites. 


There go Fann Subsidies and Russian 
wheat deals. Now anyone who plans to 
earn a living must produce in free 
market competition. 1be idea is that the 
small fanne!" or individualist gets 
an economic chance. 


The question of Licensing is not 
II 
no . ..9-
popular. If you need a heart surgeon, 
his only medical qualification will be 
his reputation. Friedman argues that this 
is already ~ 
case since patients shop 
arm~nd for medical care anyway. Once 
more the Government interferes by 
limiting competition. 


Strict Non-lnterventkmists interna-
tionally 
An America which does not .. advise" 
other nations won't need to spend 
billions a year .on defense. Simplify our 
defense to a modem equivalent of the 
militia system; just enough nuclear 
warheads to discourage others from 
aggression. 


There are three questions which most 
Libertarians agree that the Chicag~ 
School has not solved. 


If the court system should be 
abolished, civil cases might well be 
tried, as many are now, in private 
arbitration companies whose decisions 
both parties agree to respect. What 
happens to criminal cases? A public 
court, whether or not it used a privately 
owned, profit-making jail, is necessary, 
because any smart murderer would slcip 
town while his lawyers decide what 
private arbitration company to favor. 


Close the public schools, sell their 
buildings, and the universal right to 
social and economic mobility has been 
severely limited. In today's increasingly 
lee~ 
and special~ society, 
most management and professionals 
hold university diplomas. If your father 
did not make enough to send you 
through six years of elementary school, 
the chances are great that you will not 
make much more than he. 


Abolish victimless crime in the name 
of oersonal freedom and individual 
responsibility, and a shady area of 
indirect or inadvertant victimization 
appears. If man has the right to suicide 
and self-mutiliation, what happens when 
the breadwinner of a family chops off 
his hand so that he cannot work? May 
his family sue him for breach of 
contract? 


Roger Mac~ride says he would avoid 
these problems by approaching them , ~ 
he would any other question of policy, 
with three points in mind. How can 
these changes be made with minimum 
political and economic disruption? Is 
this practicable in America today? Do 
these matters come under Presidential 
jurisdiction? 


Indeed, it is the very practicality of 
his ideology which rubs other Liber-
tarians the wrong way. 1be Anarcho-
Capitalists who insist government 
should be run on a pt.aely voluntary 
basis feel that If Mr. MacBride retains a 
police fon:e, he· interferes with their 
lives. 


The object of all this dissent is a 
stocky, 46-year-old man with a round 
red face, round glasses, and an upturned 
nose-. Owner/Producer of the Little 
House on the Prairie tele;,ision series, 
he spends up to 75% of his time 
campaigning. This is not his first shot at 
public office, so he knows the political 
ropes weU enough to realize that the 
only way be can familiarize himself 
with the American public is through 
grass roots, day by day. door to door 
stumping, and massive mail solicitation. 


Roger MacBride attended Princeton 
and Harvard Law School. He published 
both dissertations and won a Fulbright
