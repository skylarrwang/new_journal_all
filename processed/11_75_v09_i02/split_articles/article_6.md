The New Journal/November II, 1975 
I've only scratched the swface; if 
movies are adventure, so are the 
audiences. Almost anything can happen. 
On New Year's Eve several years ago, I 
was at a friend's house in Dobbs Ferry, 
New York, and to kill time until Guy 
Lombardo croaked in from Times 
Square, we decided to go the the local 
movie house. Now Dobbs Ferry has the 
distinction of having been single<! out 
by Time magazine as one of the Ten 
Ugliest Towns in the United States. Its 
movie theater is appropriately dingy, 
and some of its inhabitants are 
correspondingly chaJ"J1ling. So Jaime 8nd 
I are watching the double bill, Fritz the 
Cat and Fanny Hill, and about halfway 
through Ms.Hill's soft-core moans and 
groans,(mind you it's only about 10:30), 
• some not-so-young weirdo in the middle 
of the theater stands up and starts to 
strip, shouting, " Happy goddamn New 
Year! Happy goddarnn New Year!" 
When he's naked, he puts back on his 
hat and coat and starts running around 
the theater, still yelling, " Happy god-
damn New Year! Happy goddamn New 
Year! '' opening and closing his coat as 
he runs. The audience, as bored with 
the movie as he was, is on the floor 
laughing hysterically. The manager :Uust 
have had some compassion even if he . 
didn't have a sense ofhumor, for he 
kicked the guy out, but dido 't have him 
arrested. After all, he was just part of 
the show. 


**Jamaican smoke**

Jamaican smoke 
Bob Marley and the Wailcrs virtually 
define reggae music, and this album is 
the most successful attempt to date at 
~apturing that sound on record. Reggae 
IS fmally catching on in thi~ countr). lt 
inruences everyone from Paul Simon to 
the Rolling S•ones, hut only .-.:~entl} ·

t~emselvcs received :my reai recogni-
uon. 
. 
Reggae music is a bizarre combina-
tion of Jamaican and African rhythms 
with_ rock'n_'roll from the late-night 
Flonda stations, liberally lubricated with 
the finest Jamaican smoke. This may be 
part of the reason for .the delay in their 
acceptance by the recording industry, 
for marijuana is part of their religion, 
and their songs are very religious. The 
other part of their religion consists in 
worship of the emperor Haile Selassie 
as the living god on earth, Lion of 
Judah, King of Kings, etc. Or more 
simply, Rasta. The fact that he had been 
deposed didn't impress Bob Marley very 
much, and I suppose that news of his 
death will not matter much to the 
Rastafarians, as they call themselves. 
They take the role of prophets quite 
seriously, and it is impossible to 
understand what they are trying to do 
with music without some notion of 
where this all comes from. Specifically, 
it comes from Trenchtown, a massive 
~hetto in Jamaica that makes slums in 
ihe states look like Scarsdale. Despite 
increasing commercial success ("I 
Shot the Sheriff" was Eric Clapton's 
cover of a Bob Marley tune} they have 
not forgotten their roots. They have a 
message, and the sincerity and depth of 
their feeling just shines through the 
whole album. 
The music itself is deceptively 
simple. Subtle cross-rhythms between 
the percussion and the bass set up an 
irresistable beat which manages to hold 
perfectly the line between taste and 
energy. American musicians, particular-
ly bass ~layers, can learn alot from 
listening to reggae. They use space as 
an intrinsic part of their music, in fact, 
what they don't play is often more 
important than what they do. Discretion, 
taste, timing, and a unique style put 
Bob Marley and the Wailers several 
notches above what passes for music in 
this country. 
Maybe coming up in an environment 
like Trenchtown gives .them the maturity 
and sense of timing that never once fails 
on this album. Certainly it has given 
them a purpo:.e and a direction; Marley 
means to be taken seriously when he 
sings, 
·'Let righteousness cover the earth 
like water cover the sea 
lightning, thunder, brimstone and 
ftre"' 
If this is to be music after the Rasta 
revolution, then all hail Rasta, King of 
K:ings, Lion of Judah, and, uh, pass the

~tght mustqans played some thirty 
t~struments in~luding drums, a synthe-
Sizer, automobtle gears, and different 
sized drinking glasses half filled with

thetr socks on as they dashed from 
bongos to tubular bells to military snares 
to te~p!~ blocks. Marty Brody played 
the vtohncello and the rims of the 
drinking glasses with his bow. Keith

tmg the rhythm. Instead he· held one 
finger up, then two fingers ten seconds 
later, then three and so on each new

reattached electrical cables on his 
synthesizer. Brody did vibrato on glass 
nms and the shoeless percussionists ran 
from the snare drum to the tubular balls.

as they produced what some in the·
