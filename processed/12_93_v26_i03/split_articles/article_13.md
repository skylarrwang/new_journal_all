Participants are of different status, mutual consent could actually mean coercion. This reasoning, if applied to other debates about sex on campus, could completely change the rules of the game. Such an extension is unlikely, but logically sound. 

Yale's policy resembles the other universities' in one clear way, however, in stating the belief that students need to be protected from professors, even as it cites the "special trust" between them. By making wolves out of Yale professors, the policy seems to make sheep out of Yale students. In no other arena does the university so fully absolve students of responsibility for their own actions. And in no other area does university policy so clearly countermand the goals of liberal education: to teach students how to make their own decisions and to live by their own choices. 

Hazel knows a few things about making decisions and living by them; it's a lesson she has learned inside and outside the classroom. Perhaps her experience earns her the last word. "I didn't need protecting," she states firmly. "I was 18 and that's pretty young, but I should be allowed to make my own mistakes or forge my own bonds, and I resent that people are assuming that I can't handle things. It's part of life. You learn, love, and move on."
