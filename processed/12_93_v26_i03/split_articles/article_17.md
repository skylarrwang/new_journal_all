Along with an academic space for 
dance, there is also need for physical 
space. There is no suitable performance 
space available to undergraduate dance 
companies besides the gym's dance stu-
dios. Both Yaledancers and ALAAFIA 
have held their company concerts at 
theaters off campus. These companies 
have also encountered· problems fund-
ing concerts in the past because of the 
expense of renting theater space. 

At present, th~ two dance studios 
at the gym are shared by the dance 
organizations, dance classes, and mem-
bers of club sports. "The studios are 
available only during gym hours," said 
Sturner. "They are not dance-exclusive, 
so they suffer from lack of mainte-
nance." The distance from central 
campus also poses a danger to dancers: 
one dancer was mugged on the way to 
the gym. 

Timothy Dwight College, howev-
er, is now building a dance space with 
funds from the Greenwich Initiative 
Prize. An alumnus recently donated 
funds for the renovation of a dance stu-
dio at the gym. 

·c
ounting the number of people 
involved in the dance classes 
offered at the gym, the under-
graduate dance organizations, and the 
seminars, over 400 people are involved 
in dance· at Yale. The university has yet 
to recognize the significance of these 
numbers. Dance at Yale has grown 
because of student interest and involve-
ment; yet, without the economic sup-
port of the administration, it does not 
thrive as the other arts at Yale do. It's 
hard to be an artist alone. Without a 
more active support network, dance at 
Yale has little hope for growth beyond 
the extra-curricular and recreational 
level. Yet the dedication of many stu-
dents to the art of dance signals that a 
day may come when a Yale student will 
feel that Yale validates her- or him self 
as a dancer.
