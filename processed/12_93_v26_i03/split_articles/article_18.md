Prozac: Prescription for Perfection? 
Laura Hodes· 

F 
rom psychiatrist offices, to magazines, to the bestseller 
list, to college campuses, people are talking about 
Prozac. At least 5 million Americans and 10 million 
people worldwide have taken the antidepressant drug since 
its introduction in 1988. Last year sales of Prozac earned its 
maker Eli Lilly $2 billion, setting a new record for the sale of 
antidepressants. Media reports suggest that general practi-
tioners and college clinics give 
Prozac out generously to angst-rid-
den patients. Prozac's popularity 
rises from psychiatrists' claims that 
Prozac not only alleviates depres-
sion but increases self-confidence, 
aggressiveness, and energy, without 
major side effects. These traits 
coUld make it desirable to success-
oriented students, who might see 
Prozac as a quick means of achiev-
ing the Ivy League ethos of inex-
haustible energy and an outgoing 
personality. 

The drug's side effects include 
the jitters, insomnia, nausea, and 
decreased ability to experience 
orgasm-but none medically seri-
ous. Grateful to the drug, few 
patients complain of side effects or 
the high cost of two dollars a pill. 
Prozac was the first of a class of 
pharmaceuticals 
(which 
also 
includes the d~:ugs Zoloft and 
Paxil) called selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors, or "dean" antidepressants. These drugs 
block the reuptake of serotonin, a chemical receptor in the 
brain, so that it stays in the synapse longer and continues to 
transmit, enhancing a feeling of well-being. The older tri-
cyclic antidepressants are still widely used, and are generally 
as effective as Prozac, but have more side effecrs. But like all 
antidepressants, Prozac simply does nothing for some 
patients. Studies suggest that Prozac may successfully treat 
people with eating disorders, obesity, panic disorder, obses-
sive-compulsive behavior, and perhaps even PMS. 

Prozac's darker side taints this success story. Some 
researchers have expressed concern about Prozac-induced 
violent murders and suicides. But in one of Lilly's clinical tri-
als, researchers randomly assigned 3,065 depressed patients 
to Prozac, a placebo, or one of five other antidepressants. At 
the start of the six-week treatment period, all seven groups 
were equally prone to suicidal thoughts. By the end, the 
Prozac group was the least suicidal of the seven. In a one-
year study, researchers at Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke's 
Medical Center in Chicago monitored 1 00 Prozac users and 
found no increase in risk of suicide or violence. 

Dr. Peter Kramer, a Yale-trained psychiatrist who treats 
students at Brown University and l 
the Rhode Island School of Design, ~ 
raises other controversial issues in ~ 
his best-seller Listening to Prozac. ~ 
Prozac seems to be changing the 1i 
parameters of what is mental illness ~ 
and what is normal: if a person 
~ 
responds to Prozac, does this mean :.2 
his or her prior personality was a 1 
disorder? What is the self if a drug ~ 
can change it? Kramer has seen l:! 
Prozac alter the personalities of his 1 
patients, shifting them to a state of U 
£ 
confidence, energy, quickness, and t-
flexibility. Prozac brings out traits, 
he says, that American society val- :§ 
ues, traits that lead to success in the .S 
competitive world of American ~ 
business-and perhaps in the com-
1..:) 
petitive world of the Ivy League. 
"Prozac seemed to give social confi-
dence to the habitually timid," he 
writes, "to make the sensitive brash, 
to lend the introvert the social skills 
of a salesman." Such a drug sounds 
like the recipe for the perfect Yalie. If Yalies are accepting 
Kramer's logic, how many might already be taking Prozac to 
go from stress to success?

S 
itting on a couch in the Calhoun common room, Jack 
speaks about the depression that led him last year to 
call University Health Services' (UHS) Mental Hygiene 
to ask for a referral for a psychiatrist. Physically abused as a 
child, he cannot remember ever being happy before taking 
Prozac. When he called for a referral he was taking time off 
from Yale because his symptoms made him unable to func-
tion as a student. "I couldn't do anything," he says. "When I 
was in the dining hall I would eat by my mysel£ The effort 
of speaking to anyone, of saying hello to anyone, was enor-
mous. I drank 40 cups of coffee simply to get the energy to 
get through the day. I was an emotion-
al hemophiliac.'' He means that a 
minor comment could make him feel 
bad for days or weeks. 

He speaks wich detachment, view-
ing his depre~sion as something to be 
targeted and then eradicated so that his 
true self will emerge. Patient and doc-
tor become like Pygmalion-together 
modeling and altering the patient until 
the patient is satisfied. Jack's doctor 
prescribed him 20 mg a day after his 
first visit. Despite an initial buzz three 
days later, Jack felt no sustained 
increase in energy, so five weeks later he 
complained. ''.She recommended we 
move co 40 mg a day. We did, and 
within a ft.'W weeks I felt fine," he says. 
''I woke up one morning and realized 
that for the past few days I had felt 
fine." Like many patients who find 
relief from Prozac, Jack does not see his 
doctor for therapy anymore. 

His case shows how Prozac alters 
the relationship between patient and 
psychiatrist. Patients often go to the 
doctor with the purpose of taking the 
drug and lack interest in psychothera-
PY· According w the Am~rkan journal 
of Psychiatry, 50 perccnr of the people 
who visit psychiatrists now are put on 
medication, and, in what has become 
common practice, psychiatrists will 
consult patients only to see if the 
patient is a candidate for medication. 
Jack called Mental Hygiene with the 
sole intent of obtaining a prescription 
for an antidepressant. In fact, he dis-
liked his first psychiatrist because the 
doctor viewed antidepressants only as 
an adjunct to treatment. "If someone 
comes into a hospital with multiple 
stab wounds you don't ask them to 
recounr the events that led up to their 
stabbing. You treat the injuries," he 
argues. "I knew I was depressed. I sim-
ply wanted to get better. Whatever led 
to this biochemical state of not enough 
serotonin floating around in my brain, 
the end result was that I needed more 
. " 
serotomn. 

Jack disagrees with Kramer's con-
tention that Prozac is a drug that acts 
on personality. "I do nor feel my per-
sonality has been transformed," he 
says. "I feel I've gone from a very sad, 
morose Jack co a relatively heahhy, 
moderately happy Jack." He plans to 
stay on Prozac until a "relatively stress-
free period," probably next summer. 
but not until he feels completdy "bet-
ter." But taking Prozac has raised ques-
tions about himself which make the 
idea of stopping troublesome. "Jf I go 
off Prozac," he wonders, "will the 
things that troubled me trouble me in 
the same way again?" 

Like Jack, Kate, a sophomore, 
talks in an easy, open manner about 
her experience with Prozac. Before 
coming ro college, she had never been 
depressed. "All my relatives and friends 
from high school couldn't believe this 
was happening to me. I was completely 
stable. I was totally outgoing, friendly, 
normal." Normal. 

Her problems surfaced during 
shopping period of her freshman year. 
.. 1 think I'd been too dependent on my 
parents and I couldn't deal with the 
shock of having to make all those deci-
sions," she says. At Yale she cried con-
standy. She did not even have the ener-
gy to clean up her roo"m. "I was com-
pletely unmotivated and depressed and 
finding it hard to do things that would 
otherwise be thought to be normal." 

Kate's faculty adviser suggested she 
ask about going on Prozac because she 
needed "something to get over the 
hump." A Mental Hygiene psychiatrist 
prescribed her 20 mg a day. "It's not 
like all of a sudden it completely 
changes everything for you; it just 
helps you," she says. "It's like a catalyst 
to help you cope with the depression, a 
little push." Prozac did not transform 
her, she says. "You don't feel you're on a 
high, you just feel you are normal-
like you've gotten back to normal." 

Last year she saw a psychiatrist 
once a week at Mental Hygiene and 
now she sees one in Hamden. She was 
feeling better by the summer and went 
off the drug. "I didn't want to take it 
for a long time," she says. "I sort of 
decided I wanted to stop when I 
stopped at the end of the school year." 
When she became anxious again dur-
ing shopping period this year, she rec-
ognized the symptoms and did not 
want to return to the old self she 
remembered. Knowing what Prozac 
could do for her, she started to take it · 
again and continues to do so.
