((The names have been changed to protect the 
innocent." H ow many times have we heard 
that? Did we ever believe it? That stock dis-
claimer always seems to have a knowing smirk hidden 
inside. "Nobody's innocent," it seems to say. We resent the 
implication. 

so although this issue has its share of pseudonyms, we don't 
think they speak to the guilt or innocence of those involved. 
Names are all about identity. Often, our sources reveal 
things about themselves and their lives that stretch the very 
limits of identity: people are defined by what they say. 
Certain statements have the power to alter the way a person 
views him- or herself, not to mention the way that others 
view that person. For these reasons, we always offer the 
people whose words we use the option of anonymity. A 
standard journalistic practice, but one that has come under 
attack recently. 

"We know something you don't knovy." That's not what 
anonymity means to us, although on some level a lotÂ·of 
people read that into every pseudonym. Actually, sometimes 
we don't know: our story "Don't Stand So Close to Me" 
proves that. Only Jay Porter knows Hazel's real name, and 
even he has no idea who Professor X might be. 

All the students' names in Suzanne Kim's "Condoms for 
Kids" are pseudonymous for another reason. After trying in 
vain to get permission to talk to students at Fair Haven 
Middle School, we were worried about printing the names 
of the kids who talked to her at the New Haven Public 
Library. We didn't want to get them in trouble. 

Laura Hodes's story about Prozac really made us think 
about identity. The drug's creators hoped to remedy depres-
sion, but they may have stumbled onto a powerful agent for 
reshaping personality. Some question Prozac's ability to alter 
a person's identity, but we all know the effect of printing 
someone's name. So in Laura's piece, we decided that all the 
students should remain anonymous. 

We only had one problem with all these pseudonyms: how 
to pick the names. After settling on Luke, Emily, Kate, Jack, 
Jill, Marcus, and a few more, we were thrilled that H azel 
had the presence. of ~ind to choose her own.
