"('PJ1ve, six, five-six-seven-eight," the teacher shouts. 
Tombe, pas de bourree, glissade, jete ... The room-
ul of students begins to move quickly to the 
music, knowing that each of their movements will be 
watched and remembered. Tombe, pas de bourree, glissade, 
jete ... When the music stops, sweat drips down their brows. 
They know they strive for something for which there are no 
words. It was as if someone shouted "Dance!" and they heard 
the call. It was as if the students heard someone say "Don't 
stop till you know you gonna drop." Tom be, pas de bour-
ree, glissade, jete ... The energy of the students fills the perfor-
mance studio like the feverish steps of !indy-hoppers getting 
down. Their movements contract and release like the beats 
of the old drum that set their feet rolling. 

For many people the language of dance unlocks a world 
of artistic exploration. On any given day hundreds of people 
dance at Yale-in classes at Payne Whitney Gym, in compa-
ny rehearsals, at parties, and in their own rooms. Yet Yale 
lacks a context in which to cultivate this art form for stu-
dents who are most interested. Dancers who come to Yale 
often face the disappointment of dealing with a university 
that does not seem to recognize their talents. Many dance 
groups perform on dangerous cement floors in residential 
college dining halls. Those who dance off-campus face prob-
lems financing productions ineligible for the funds allocated 
to on-campus theater and music productions. Students who 
dance at Yale often become so concerned with trying to over-
come these setbacks that their goal of dancing gets lost with-
in a struggle for intellectual, academic, and physical space for 
dance at Yale. 

Dance at Yale began with the arrival of women to Yale 
College in 1969. To accommodate the new "coeds" the uni-
versity introduced classes in synchronized swimming, mod-
ern dance, and ballet at Payne Whitney Gym. Dance, how-
ever, took hold more outside the curriculum than within it. 
At present, there are at least six dance companies, including 
ALAAFIA (which means "peace" in Yoruba), which concen-
trates on African and modern dance; the Ballroom Dance 
Team; Danceworks, a 40-member dance group; 
Dance Thingy, which focuses on experimental movement 
and improvisation; Rhythmic Blue, a contemporary street 
dance group; and Yaledancers, the first dance organization 
founded at Yale. The non-credit recreational dance program 
at Payne Whitney includes beginning to advanced levels of 
ballet and modern dance, as well as classes in ballroom 
dance, jazz, and creative African dance. Other dance courses

have been offered through the residential college seminar 
program. Ann Cowlin, a dance instructor at Payne Whitney, 
teaches a college seminar which focuses on kinesiology and 
anatomy entitled Movement and Mind. This year, represen-
tatives of most of Yale's dance organizations have formed the 
Dance Coalition to act as a collective voice for dance at Yale. 

The Dance Coalition seeks to establish an intellectual 
space for dance at Yale. Barbara Feldman, a dance instructor 
at Payne Whitney and the Yale School of Drama for nearly 
20 years, said, "I think for some reason people used to look 
at dance solely as entertainment. Somehow people at Yale 
didn't quite understand dance had its own theory, li t~rature, 
and technique." A fellow of Silliman College, Feldman has 
offered a college seminar on dance composition for nine 
years. Feldman remembers when the university's outlook 
toward dance was one of concern. During the late 70s and 
early 80s a faculty committee was looked into incorporating 
dance courses into an academic department at the drama 
school. "When I was Dean of Yale College there was a great 
deal of exploration of how to bring dance to a more promi-
nent position," said Howard Lamar, former president of 
Yale. 

A lack of financial resources shifted the university's atti-
tude to one of ambivalence. "My feeling is that there has 
been interest and sympathy on the part of the faculty to sup-
port a stronger dance program, but little money to do so," 
said Lamar. Betty Trachtenberg, Dean of Student Affairs 
and the parent of a professional dancer and dance edu-
cator, has expressed interest in working with the 
Dance Coalition on issues concerning student 
d ancers, but she does not foresee increased 
fmancial involvement in dance. The universi-
ty has never advertised itself as a school for 
dance, said Trachtenberg. "Students 
interested in dance must decide 
whether to come here knowing 
this," she said. Trachtenberg has 
advised dance organizations in 
need of moral and financial 
support to turn to their 
alumni. 

"I think Yale 
can't be all things 
to all people," 
Feldman said. 


"On the other hand, I think that dance 
is one of the oldest art forms, if not the 
oldest. Dance connects the world of 
science and humanities. It is just a vital 
part of the liberal arts background. 

"Some of the most enthusiastic 
members of my seminar have been sci-
einists, actors, musi-
cians, writers-peo-
ple who have a strong 
interest in dance but 
are not necessarily 
accomplished techni-
cians," said Feldman. 

Students 
can 
experience 
dance 
within dance courses, 
but for chose who 
want to expand on 
previous dance expe-
rience, the opportu-
nities are limited. 

Some students do 
what a freshperson 
did last semester: she 
decided Yale's lack of 
dance offerings was 
the Arcs, but dance has found strength 
through many growing college dance 
programs. Harvard established a rep-
utable summer and year-round dance 
program at Radcliffe College which 
attracts noted ballet, modern, jazz, and 
African dance professionals. Princeton 
too much of an edu- Yaledancers turn loose ai the Educational Center for the Artss 
cational sacrifice and 
transferred to a college with an estab-
lished dance department. "Someone as 
talented as she shouldn't have to be dis-
couraged," said Cowlin, "She needed a 
place where she could be validated." A 
member of Al.AAFIA agreed. "There is 
a lot of ignorance here about what 
dance is and what it takes," she said. 
"The real challenge for dancers at Yale 
is getting past the issue of why we are 
here as dancers." Many dancers who 
decide to come to Yale realize their 
decision often becomes a decision to 
sacrifice dance for an education. "Why 
can't I get a top education at an Ivy 
League institution and still be allowed 
to. dance seriously?" asked the 
ALAAFIA dancer. 

The validity that dance lacks at 
Yale may come with the creation of an 
academic space within the course of 
study. On a national level, the funding 
of dance has been cut by organizations 
such as the National Endowment for 
20 THE NEW jOURNAL 
has a number of dance courses for 
credit under the umbrella of a humani-
ties program. Vassar awards half credit 
for dance technique classes. Wesleyan 
has a dance major. "The perception of 
dance has changed nationally from the 
media coverage," said Feldman. "If you 
look at the theater section of any news-
paper, dance is an active part of any 
community setting." 

The number of performing dance 
groups, the number of advanced 
dancers within these groups, and the 
number of students who have pursued 
dance in courses indicate a need for 
academic faculty for dance at Yale. The 
university currently relies on the recre-
ational dance program offered at rhe 
gym to meet the needs of all dancers at 
Yale. The program carers to the majori-
ty of students who come to the dance 
classes. "Suppose there is an intermedi-
ate/advanced 
class," 
Feldman 
explained, "If ten of the people are 
intermediate and two advanced l 
dancers show up, it would be inappro-
'} 
priate co teach co the level of the two 
~ 
and exclude the ocher ten." 

Both ALAAFIA and Yaledancers ~ 
have cried to supplement the offerings 
of the recreational dance program by ] 
bringing in guest .B 
artists and choreog-
raphers. Last year 
ALAAFIA hired a 
..E 
m!mber of outside 
Cl 
artists to teach Iindy-
hop, jazz, flamenco, 
and 
afro-modern 
dance in order to 
bring varied cultural 
dance forms to Yale, 
and raise money for 
irs concerts. 

S o 
m 
e 
dancers, 
however, 
find such an arrange-
ment problematic. 
Hiring teachers on a 
guest basis does not 
provide the continu-
ity of academic facul-
ty 
to 
students. 
"Someone comes in for a semester and 
you never see them again," 
said 
Feldman. "I don't think you learn as a 
student and a. dancer that way." 

Without access to a structured aca-
demic dance program, dancers at Yale 
miss out on the chance to share ideas 
about dance in an open atmosphere, a 
benefit students in recognized per-
forming and fine arts departments 
enjoy. "It's interesting co see the work· 
that other students do," said Kate 
Schuler (SY '96), a potential art major. 
"You get feedback from the professors 
who see your works in progress. It's 
hard to be an artist alone." 

M
any of the dance groups at 
Yale are geared toward per-
forming rather than practice. 
"The students are trying to do it all 
alone," said Feldman. "The perfor-
mance goals are overly ambitious so · 
that value is put on product rather than 
DECEMBER 3> 1993 

The quality of dance here is 
uneven. Some people have had enough 
training to function independently. 
Ochers haven't." 

Dancers at Yale often call on 
Feldman and Cowlin to perform the 
duties of dance faculty, whether to pre-
view a series of pieces before a concert 
or to advise the choreography of a 
dance piece. In the last five years 
Feldman has advised five senior pro-
jects and independent studies on 
dance. "I have literally seen a dozen of 
my students embark on professional 
dance careers," she said. 

Many students recognize the 
importance of a dance department to 
act as a voice for their needs. "A dance 
department would create an organized 
dialogue between students, administra-
tion, and faculty who dance;" pointed 
out Kristin Sturner (TD '94), artistic 
director ofYaledancers. "There should 
be more sharing and an increased num-
ber of lectures on dance. More collabo-
ration needs to be done between musi-
cians and dancers, actors and dancers, 
more informal workshops-so that 
people can watch casually." A depart-
ment would also provide a conduit for 
communication and the distribution of 
funds. "There are many alumni who 
want to give money to dance at Yale 
but technically there is no dance 
department at Yale and therefore no 
dance at Yale," said Sturner.
