all me slim. That's what Jay, Toymaker, bap, whoa,

Knot, Chron, and storm called me. It's short for 
(~slim@MINERVA.cis.yale.edu). From the start we 
hit it off. It went like this: 
***slim(-slim@MINERVA.cis .yale . edu) has 
joined channel #bored 
<whoa> Hi , s l im ... al . 
<storm> hey there 
: ) 
>Hey guys, what ' s up? 
<whoa> Hello? Where is everyone else? 
<Whoa> Toy? 
Chron? 
<whoa> I guess it's just you and me, slim 
I had not expected such a warm welcome, at least not 
quite so soon. I hadn't even said anything yet. Still,-they 
greeted me eagerly, and my not-so-creative "Hey guys, 
what's up?" seemed to convince them that I was all right. As 
the Macintosh screen scrolled with chit-chat, I learned more 
about my new acquaintances. They were almost all college 
students, some from California, some from Kansas, one 
from Cornell. Apparently they had met before. To return 
the warmth, I was first to greet the next arrival 
***bap(JWILLIAMS@Athena .cob .miami . edu) has

<whoa> Sip! Bop ! Sap ! 
<toymaker> Sap ! 
<Jay> Whoa so what do you study at santa

<Whoa> How rude 


So this was the Internet, that computer-based, fiber-
optic world where friendships were made and broken with-
out the distractions of sight, sound, or touch. "You can be 
who you really are," Jonathan Lawrence Leger, 16, wrote in 
Internet World, "let your personality shine through." Since 
this was my first time on the Net, I Md trouble being any-
thing. Keeping track of who said what, and to whom, pro-
vided enough of a challenge. Typing and entering responses 
before the conversation topic changed was almost impossi-
ble. 

My friend Moria, a computer assistant, had helped me 
through a labyrinth of passwords and login ID codes, a pro-
cess that had taken over 20 minutes because more than 100 
other Yale students had already logged on. Moria pointed 
out that many of them were communicating with other 
Yalies, and I wondered why they had chosen the computer 
over a phone call or a personal visit. Once on the Net, 
Moria left me skimming delightfully through the catalog of 
over 600 coiwersation channels that make up IRC (Internet 
Relay Chat), the Net social appendage where a lot of college 
students spend their time while on the system. The number 
of current participants followed each channel name, and 
sometimes a discussion topic followed as well. It looked 
something like this: 

#SeaFood 1 
#disney no violence, nudity or bad language 
allowed 
#malaysia 54 
#canada 
NUDE '!WISTER PARTY TONIGHT 
#sex 29 
LIFE SUCKS!! SO DOES PHYSICS 
#Sweden 4 
Land of cOnFuSiOn! 
# [$8$0$- [ ( 

Moria warned me that this last channel was private, and 
that the channel operator had to invite me to join. No 
worry-there were hundreds of open channels, with knowl-
edgeable and friendly users who could tell me more about 
this place called cyberspace. 

I noticed that #malaysia had drawn by far the largest 
crowd. I had read about foreign freedom fighters, like those 
journalists in Russia and Yugoslavia who had sent their 
reports on the Internet when all other avenues had been 
closed to them. Perhaps I had found their Asian counter-
parts. I decided to find out: /join #malaysia.

<addi> nani nantilah hari rabu kot ..

<lalat> nani pleeez le 
<HET> BIOL : 
ok geng , pi cari kawar baru 
<nani> nem: cit! 

With over 50 people logged on, #malaysia's conversation 
zipped along, line after line of indecipherable text slipping 
onto the bottom of the screen. I sensed that addi, lalat, and 
company were probably not exchanging news of political 
developments, but rather personal updates. I had nothing to 
say. I panicked. What if they were saying something about 
me, about loser Americans who crashed their party? I didn't 
belong here and I knew it: /leave #malaysia.

Okay. The words stopped flowing. So did m y sweat. I 
needed a break from eavesdropping. 

I
nternet founders probably never envisioned an interna-
tional cartel of bored college students when, back in 
1969, they set up the utilitarian ARPANET, a U.S. 
Defense Department network for military research. Fifteen 
years later, the National Science Foundation's NSFNET 
opened up access to networks, which previously had been 
limited . to computer science researchers, government 
employees, and government contractors. The NSF offered 
to connect universities if they promised to spread access to 
students; and with free use of an otherwise costly system, 
college students make up a significant portion of Net users. 
On IRC, procr~tination vehicle extraordinaire, everyone is 
a college student-almost. 
<Jay> slim where are you stuctying? 
>Yale 
<Jay> neat I feel honored to be typing with 
a Yale fellow 
<Whoa> me too 
>no really guys, please 
<KnOt> Not I 
<Whoa> Hey Knot, aren't you from Stanford 
<Knot> nu uh . . 
>Harvard? 
*Knot is in high school 
<Whoa> Not! really, knot? 
<Knot> Really 
<Jay> Knot, shouldn ' t you be in bed? 
***Nelmar (kateye@ACS . BU .EDU) has joined 
channel #bored 
<Jay> Knot, seriously, my friend . 
A grow 

ing human needs plenty of REM s leep 
<Nelmar> I feel so old 
<whoa> How old are you anyway? 
<Knot> I 'm 14! 
<Jay> no way! 
>You ' re probably the only one here who has 
n ' t passed his sexual prime .. 
<Knot> I ' m not a his, thank you 
>oops, sorry 
<whoa> Go girl ! 

It was then that I learned never to assume anything on 
the Net. Ordinary circumstances may not offer opportuni-
ties for 14-year-old high school girls and 22-year-old college 
boys to converse, but ordinary circumstances do not apply 
to the Net. 

Fortunately, my kind #bored friends understood that, 
as a Nee neophyte, I was still struggling with the basics. I 
could barely follow the train of thought on #bored, not to 
mention all those asterisks and arrows. I needed the experi-
ence of a recognized Net master, like my friend Phoebe. She 
joined me at a computer and tried to explain the Net's 
nuances. 

"I use it far too often," Phoebe confessed. "You meet 
strange people on the Internet, wacky people. You either get 
the people who are really depressed, really lonely, or don't fit 
in. Social misfits." She could not be calking about my 
Internet buddies. "Most of the people you talk to on it are 
at least moderately depressed. I've had people cry on my 
shoulder." I imagined salty drops condensing on her moni-
tor. "It fosters escape from the real world. 

"I have hangouts," Phoebe cold me as she joined #Kill. 
"The people all know each other. You have inside jokes. 
That's one of the advantages of being an IRC regular." 

Phoebe showed me the channel roster, and I noticed repre-
sentatives from Michigan, Ohio, Colorado, California, 
Virginia, fiew Zealand, and New York. Sometimes a Yale 
professor logs on, but Phoebe doesn't know who it is. 
<RINGO> HI ALL 
<She-hulk> don't yell 

With caps for loudness, these experienced Net U;Sers 
conveyed emotion on the channel. " : ) is a smiley face." 
Phoebe pointed to the screen. " ; )-that's a wink. : ( is a 
frown." I learned that triple asterisks mean an adminis-
trative change, like someone joining or leaving, and a 
single asterisk prefaces the self-narration some Net

users prefer to direct dialogue. 

Other shortcuts: ROFL (rolls on 
the floor laughing), BTW (by the 
way), and IMHO (in my humble 
opinion). This night, however, no 
one seemed especially humble. 
<brae> is this the lol 
lipop channel? 
<HOTLEZFEM> C'MON BABE!!! 
ME AND YOU!!! 
<Larks> hahahahahaha 
<Tailgunnr> 
hmm, 
what 
flavors do we have 
tonight? 
*HOTLEZFEM GYRATES SUG 
GESTIVELY IN FRONT OF 
RINGO ... 
<RINGO> WHO SPEAK SPANISH 
HER?? 
*Prism* Indeed .. who knows 
what fate will bring 
*thoughtful look* 
<HOTLEZFEM> DONDE ESTA 
CASA DE PEPE? 
***HOTLEZFEM is now known 
as lockjaw 

I was not laughing as heartily as 
Phoebe. I wanted the warm fuzzies of 
#bored. "Pick a school." Phoebe 
turned to me. "Okay, U of Chicago it 
is." She entered a series of characters 
and up came a list of all Chicago stu-
dents presently on the Net-their 
login names and which channel they 
had joined. I noticed that one was on 
#hardsex and wondered if he wanted 
two hackers from Yale to know his 
whereabouts. Of course, most Net reg-
ulars have accepted the lack of privacy 
as part of the login process. Basically, 
being on the Net means being 
exposed. Even classified government 
computers, with all their security 
checks, have had unwelcome visitors. 
Because the Internet, actually a con-
glomeration of hundreds of local com-
puter networks, reaches over 50 coun-
..tries, locating and punishing these 
hackers can be tough, especially those 
who route their calls thro\lgh the 
Netherlands, where no laws regulating 
computer access exist. 

I don't think Phoebe had such 
grand designs, although she did enjoy 
devices suitable for international espi-
onage. At will, she ignored RINGO 
(RINGO's entries did not appear on 
Phoebe's computer). She directed pri-
vate remarks to Prism that no one else 
received. She observed two channels 
simultaneously. If she missed some-
thing, she scrolled back the conversa-
tion, a wire tapper in a time machine. 
Maybe she had found me the other 
night, retraced my series of mistakes, 
and shown them .. to her ruthless Net 
companions for amusement. 

I had seen enough snooping for 
one night, so I thanked Phoebe and 
found my own computer. Quiet stu-
dents, typing furiously, packed the 
computer room, though midnight had 
already passed. No one ever looked up 
or talked to anyone else, but from time 
to time someone would burst out 
laughing, then quickly stifle it. This 
time around I wanted channels that 
promised support. Hoping to find my 
friends whoa and Jay again-they had 
treated me so well-I hopped on 
#bored. But this time I found only 
Art-Hat, engaged in what seemed to 
be a monologue on the fate of the 
shoe. This would not do. I wanted 
people I could trust.
