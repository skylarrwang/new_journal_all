EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Now I had really blown it. Those 
#Gospel folks could track me down, 
find me, discover that I was j ewish. All 
it would take is a simple /finger slim. 
The command would call up my 
name, year of graduation, and residen-
tial college. My recent login times-
for IRC, E-mail, or whatever-
would 
follow. Even without this technique, 
they could trace me to Yale from my 
official domain address (MINERVA 
cis.yale.edu). "MINERVA" is the 
name of the computer through which 
I accessed the Internet; "cis" is the 
group that created and maintains this 
computer name; "yale" indicates that 
this group lies within Yale University; 
and "edu" designates the domain con-
taining all computers in all U.S. edu-
cational institutions. 


Other domains include "com" 
(commercial), "gov," and "mil." Users 
in these realms generally stay away 
from IRC and stick with services like 
USENETNews, the world's largest 
electronic bulletin board, and ftp (file 
transfer protocol). With these tools, 
they gain access to hundreds of 
resources: Homebrew Digest (beer 
recipes), Frequently Asked Questions 
about becoming an astronaut {cour-
tesy of NASA), the Simpsons archive, 
Guitar Chords and Tablature, and 
countless others. 


But I was just looking for some-
one to hang out with. Still traumatized 
by my self-imposed excommunication 
from #Gospel', I needed a more 
relaxed, mellow environment.

Nothing could arouse Weedbot, 
SharpBot, and DopeBot. I had tried in 
three languages, waiting after each 
attempt. No response. I pictured the 
three of them staring blankly at their 
monitors. Maybe they had slid off 
their chairs and onto their floors, 
Maybe they had found some way to 
communicate that did not require 
computers. Whatever the case, they 
weren't in the mood to talk to me, or 
to each other. I tried again, this time 
wishing for some Southern hospitality.

<skimbles> kkat takes you 
that long? heck mine

<skimbles> i set it up 
when football starts so 
the cowboys will win : ) 
<Kkat> well .... i need to 
get moine from my par 
ents house ... .. 
<JavaMan> how long was 
that kick, anyone know? 
Not even a simple "hi slim." Gone 
were the days of warm greetings and 
inclusive conversations. I left skimbles 
and snausages to their cryptic discus-
sion, wanting to know why they didn't 
like slim, whom they had never seen, 
heard, or spoken to. Then I gave it one 
last shot. Hours before, I had noticed 
channel #yale, but no one had logged 
on. Now, after 2:00 am, I joined.

Still no one home. I created a topic 
suited to my mood. I waited. About 
ten minutes later, I had company.

***Signoff : 
kjc9 (Leaving) 
The final message interrupted me 
in mid-sentence-"yup. well g-." 
kjc9 had taken the words right out of 
my fingers. I too had planned to leave. 
kj c9 and I had raced, and I had lost. 
He or she had escaped the void first, 
and I was alone once again. Out of the 
N e t's estimated 30 million users, I 
could not find one who would talk to 
me. I had let m y personality shine 
through all right, right through the 
computer screen. It was blank.
