The advent of AIDS in the early 80s changed forever the terms of the long-running sex education debate. The threat of America's children dying of AIDS fueled the dispute with an urgency that has culminated in a movement that seeks to begin to educate children beginning in elementary school. 

To protect the city's children from the epidemic, the New Haven Public School District has launched full force into AIDS awareness education. Patricia McCann-Vissepo, chair of the Board of Education, refers to a statistic from Yale-New Haven's Pediatric/Adolescent Clinic stating that 1 out of 70 of the clinic's patients were HIV positive. Effective December 1, the new plan to make condoms available to middle schoolers and high schoolers represents the joint effort of school board and health care providers to prevent further cases of HIV among New Haven's kids. 

Apart from the political clamor stand the children in their very real world. They hang out at school, the library, the mall, and talk about the raw facts of their lives. Adult rhetoric is not the issue. Reality is. The kids follow their own reasoning concerning the debate that revolves around the "C-word." 

A student can walk into a school clinic and get a condom-provided that the student has obtained parental permission to use the clinic's services-in four schools: Jackie Robinson Middle School, Roberto Clemente Middle School, Fair Haven Middle School, and Wilbur Cross High School. Hillhouse High School is preparing to implement the plan in January. Some of those involved in the new program focus on saving New Haven's youth from AIDS at any cost. "We have it in our power as adults, whether we're church leaders, civic leaders, or mothers and fathers," says Dr. Alvin Novick, professor of biology at Yale. "We have it in our power to save most of these kids." 

The Ad Hoc HIV/AIDS Adolescent Task Force, made up of representatives of New Haven's main health-care facilities, pushed aggressively for condom availability this past summer. The proposal came from a concern to address the problems of AIDS in a community where early sexual activity is the norm. The Social and Health Assessment Survey was compiled jointly by the New Haven's Social Development Department and the Yale Child Study Center. It revealed that 28.1 percent of New Haven sixth graders, 49.9 percent of eighth graders, and 66 percent of tenth graders are sexually active. In light of the rapid spread of AIDS, reports of early sexual activity have alarmed the adult community. These numbers translate into the possibility of premature deaths for children. 

But these statistics do not necessarily bring AIDS to the minds of students. "The topic of AIDS is not an issue with teenagers. Who you are with and with how many people is the topic. AIDS is the topic with adults," says Jill, a senior at Hillhouse. Sexual activity is a matter of course. AIDS is not a matter of discourse. 

Beyond the numbers are the teenagers' everyday observations. "At least 90 percent of the kids at school are having sex, even youngsters, even 11-year-olds, because a lot of kids now look older," says Jill, with a deliberate cadence and a direct gaze. She is careful to clarify that this is not atypical. "It's not just at Hillhouse. It's at all the schools." Marcus, a freshman at Hillhouse, refers to boys touching girls in a sexual manner, "You see boys 'feeling on' girls, and the girls laugh." But Marcus doesn't. He shakes his head. 

Janet Spinner of the Ad Hoc HIV/AIDS Adolescent Task Force is a midwife specializing in prenatal care. She comments on the sexual patterns of teenage patients. "It's fascinating because we don't have a kid who one night sleeps with Jeff, the next night with Susie, and the next night with Elizabeth, and so on. Instead, you have serially monogamous relationships. Do you know what that means?" she asks with measured impatience. 

"The kid will have a relationship for two months-they're madly in love with them-and they happen to have intercourse," she explains at a school-teacher pace. "They usually don't expect that they will be sexually active. They have intercourse and they tend not to protect themselves, and they have a fight. Sometimes it's after an act of intercourse. So they break off." The pattern repeats itself. 

The kids themselves relate with precision the rules of adolescent sexual behavior. Jill speaks of two trends that she has observed. "If the couple is together they have sex within a month," she says straightforwardly. Or, in other cases, the "serial monogamy" pattern Spinner stresses doesn't necessarily hold. "Sometimes, they might mess with one person tonight and three days later, someone else, like adults would say, a 'one-night stand'," says Jill. 

AIDS education supporters aim for more awareness about the dangers of HIV. The Task Force has been active for the past few years, since an increased number of AIDS cases came to Spinner's attention. "About four years ago, I started noticing that I was diagnosing a significantly high frequency of kids coming out HIV positive," she says. This led to the Task Force working with the New Haven Public School District to discuss the epidemic in New Haven. "We started to help boost the consciousness about the problem," she says. Aggressive reminders to "use a condom" saturate the media in an effort to pierce the public's "consciousness." But did the rhetoricians anticipate what kind of response they'd get from kids? 

Holly, a senior at Hillhouse, murmurs as she talks about the kids in her school. She says kids carry condoms because it means they're having sex. Having a condom doesn't mean using a condom. "A lot of boys have condoms to show off, but when it comes down to it, they don't use them," she says. 

"Kids at school walk around with big bags of condoms to sell them. They're not ashamed. They want to show off," says Jill. 

But it's not all about showing off. Anthony, a seventh grader at Jackie Robinson Middle School, focuses on the practical aspect of condom availability. "It can prevent AIDS from going around. It'll help a lot of people who can't afford it and like to have sex," he says. 

Marcus believes that sex will happen no matter what; he distinguishes himself from his peers by addressing the issue of AIDS. "Kids are probably going to have sex after school, they need condoms. All of these kids nowadays are having sex. There's a lot of AIDS," he says. 

Adults say the debate is about AIDS and curbing teenage sexual behavior. Some also say it's about morality. "The Judeo-Christian tradition would be opposed to the whole idea from the moral point of view," says Reverend Howard Nash of St. Bernadette's Church. "I am opposed to making condoms available in schools to children of any age. It's not just a question of ten-year-olds in fifth grade," he says adamantly. Nash constructs his argument on the notion of a hard-and-fast principle. "The bottom line is that we have the Ten Commandments," he says. "According to the Sixth Commandment, it's wrong for kids to have sex." 

"Making condoms available to kids in school sends a message that I don't want to send," maintains Nash. The message is this: 'It's all right to have sex."' His voice rises. "No matter what you say, no matter how you disguise it, no matter what you tell the children, once you give them a condom, you're signifying at least implicit approval of what they're doing." 

But Jill knows that kids have crossed Nash's bottom line and there's no turning back. "It's not telling the kids to go have sex because they're doing it anyway," she says. 

Holly acknowledges that younger and younger kids are having sex. But that doesn't mean she approves of ten-year-olds having sex. She feels that a ten-year-old boy may get the idea that having sex is an option, since he has a condom. "I think giving condoms to ten-year-old boys will make them think they have a right to have sex," she says. 

Novick's discourse doesn't touch upon these issues. The professor who teaches AIDS and Society instead addresses the reality that kids are having sex.
