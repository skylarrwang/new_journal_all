and that AIDS does exist. He argues 
vehemently that people like Nash are 
"murd erers." When asked why, he 
bursts out "Wh y?" with incredulous 
exasperation. "Because if they oppose 
. sex education, these kids will die of 
AIDS. If we do educate them, some of 
them will survive. They are dooming 
these kids to die of ignorance. It's that 
simple." 

Abstinence is Nash's answer to the 
problem of "saving the kids." Giving a 
kid a condom won't solve anything, . 
says Nash. "I'm not gonna look at a lit-
tle kid, who's ten years old or 18 years 
old and say, 'I'm going to give up on 
you. You're an animal. Go follow your 
animal instincts,"' he says. ''I'm going 
to challenge this person not to have · 
sex. It's wrong. It's wrong for you." 

Novick discredits any expectation 
that teenagers will stop having sex. 
"The likelihood of being able to devel-
op an education program that elimi-
nates sexual activity 
in teenagers 
is so remote 
that

think it possi-
ble," he argues. "The 
religious spokespersons don't 
even stop priests from having sex, so 
help me." 

As a mother of three, the Task 
Force's Spinner has formulated her 
notion of a "good lesson." Spinner's 
morality lesson doesn't include the Ten 
Commandments. "The problem is, 
you don't teach morals in five min-
utes," she explains. "You can't say that 
just because there's HIV out there 
you're never going to have intercourse 
again and have anybody listen to 
you .... One of the things that my kids 
learned early on was to protect their 
little behinds-protect themselves, 
protect their lives .... That's part of 
morals." 

Kids provide their own answers. 
They draw examples from home or 
their personal beliefs. Marcus doesn't 
talk about the Ten Commandments or 
his "little behind." "It's morally wrong 
for kids to be having sex because 
they're kids and they're not yet 
mature," he says. 

Sex education can change kids' 
attitudes, says Marcus. He criticizes 
the ways boys ·trea~ girls as school. He 
sees sex education as a means to 
reform the way the sexes interact, as 
well as to increase awareness about 
STD's. "Some of the boys in my 
school they have very perverted 
minds," he says. "Sex education will 
help a little." 

Luke, a freshman at Hillho
mother and father are both on drugs 
and they go out and have sex with 
other people, and the kids see it, they'll 
do it too," Jill says. "It's the environ-
ment of the household." Strictness 
says his opinions about sex orig-
inated in his home. He ......... 
:"-.!:*',.,,..,~-'=""'',. 
says his mom has told 
him "indirectly" that he. 
shouldn't have sex. "My 
parents won't allow that," he 
says. Luke outlines his view 
of the proper time to begin 
having sex: "Now, kids should 
get educated, wait till they're a 
little older, and then decide to set-
tle down." 

Marcus's parents have openly 
urged him not to become sexually 
active too soon. They have given him 
a sense of responsibility for his future. 
"I talk to my parents about sex. My 
mom says, 'Go to college first and 
make something of your life and make 
sure she doesn't have AIDS and then, 
of course ... " he says. 

Jill points ro the effect irresponsi-
ble parents may have on their children. 
"It's also the way the family acts. If the 
isn't necessarily a negative influence. "I 
like that my parents are strict with me. 
I don't think that it's true that if your 
parents keep you in the house, you'll 
go out and be wild," she says. "I think 
you can learn from the household." 

U
ke, Holly, Marcus, Jill, and 
Anthony have little trouble dis-
ussing sex. 
But Spinner 
attributes much of the controversy 
over condom availability to people's 
discomfort with the topic. She speaks 
boldly about the sexuality that she says 
the rest of timid America feels so awk-
ward discussing. "We use sexuality 


across the board to sell just about 
everything in America, yet we can't 
talk about it in a forthright, concrete 
fashion," she says. The Task Force pro-
duced a ten-step plan to introduce 
topics of sexuality. "It's been fascinat-
ing to me that I have not gotten the 
attention of groups like the media, 
until we said the big 'C- word'-the 
'condom' word," she says indignantly. 

The "two-sided" attitude toward 
sex, which Spinner terms it, places 
teens in a precarious position. "The 
dilemma is that what we have is a sex-
uality in our culture that causes 
stress-like guilt," she says. "It's like 
'I'm not supposed to be screwing, but 
I am.'" 

Not everyone has a difficult time 
with the idea of sex. "It's nothing to be 
ashamed o£ It's just life," says Marcus. 

T
he AIDS education debate has 
changed its 
language to 
address the fact that condoms 
are not 100 percent effective. "Safe 
sex" has now changed to "safer sex." 

Nash insists abstinence is the only 
solution. "If you want to get honest, 
the surveys, the stats of condom use 
for preventing AIDS are not really 
high, which I don't care about because 
I'm against them anyway," Nash is 
quick to clarify. "But if you give this 
to a kid and say, 'O.K., you're safe 
now,' it's wrong. It's like giving him a 
life preserver with a hole in it. He's 
gonna drown .... The only safe sex is 
no sex." 

The kids discuss the topic in the 
library. Holly and Jill converse on the 
pro's and con's of condoms as they sit 
at a long table with college guide 
books laid out in front of them. 

"You're better safe than sorry," 
says Holly solemnly. Jill sets forth the 
ever-open option of abstinence. "But 
it's better not to do it than anything 
else," she says. Holly concedes that 
nothing is completely safe. "Condoms 
aren't 100 percent," she says. "Better 
not 100 percent, than nothing at all," 
Jill responds. Holly nods. The core of 
the argument lays bare. 

B
y all accounts, the debate cen-
ters on giving condoms to kids. 
But Reverend Nash's opposition 
doesn't end there. He seems most 
angry when he discusses the politics of 
the situation-what he views as the 
undemocratic way the school board 
voted on the plan on July 26, 1993. 

"This is not government for the peo-
ple, by the people, of the people," says 
the reverend belligerently. "It's a per-
fect example of bad government, a few 
people ramming something down the 
throat of the majority. It's wrong." 

Nash suspects the school board of 
voting during the summer in order to 
avoid public debate. "I refer _to July 
26, 1993, as a 'day of infamy,'" he 
says. "That's when the school board
