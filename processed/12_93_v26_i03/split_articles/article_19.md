EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Emily, a sophomore, has been 
clinically depressed since the age of II 
and has been seeing a therapist since 
the age of I6. She went through two 
severe depressions the spring of her 
freshman year. "I was basically unable 
to function in my life," she says. "I was 
sleeping all the time, I had no appetite, 
and I was totally uninterested in any-
thing in my life." She arranged an 
intake interview at Mental Hygiene in 
which a doctor assessed her situation. 
After that, she says, the first counselor 
who saw her "wasn't very helpful 
because she didn't take what I was 
going through very seriously." Emily 
arranged to see a doctor instead. In 
April she went through a severe week-
long depression and was prescribed 
Prozac's sister drug Zoloft, which her 
father takes successfully. 

Unlike Jack and Kate, Emily 
remembers the exact moment when 
she knew the drug had taken effect, 
four weeks after she began medication. 
"I still remember the moment when it 
started to work," she says. "I suddenly 
felt happy and I hadn't felt happy so 
long that for a moment I didn't know 
what I was feeling." She did not know 
what happiness felt like, a statement 
that echoes those of many Yale stu-
dents who complain they never feel 
happy at Yale. Yet the urgency of her 
words makes her seem different. "My 
life has changed in a way I could never 
have thought po~sible," she says. ''I'm 
incredibly grateful for Prozac, and for 
my doctor for prescribing it to me. I 
have never felt better in my life." She 
says the drug saved her life. "If it 
weren't for Prozac I wouldn't be here." 
As it has for Jack, the drug has 
practically replaced psychotherapy for 
Emily. After her first depression, she 
saw her psychiatrist at least once a 
week; now she sees him monthly. She 
does not plan to stop taking the drug 
in "the short term." She says, 
"Eventually I may, but there's a signifi-
cant history of depression in my fa.mi-
ly. It may be a permanent situation. At 
the moment I don't have any plans to 
stop it in the near future." 

In her opinion, instead of altering 
her personality, Prozac helped Emily 
express her true self. "I think it made 
me able to be who I am. Depression 
really muted me. I had a lot of self-hate 
and self-doubt," she says. "I was never 
satisfied with my life. I think those 
things were hampering meÂ·and not 
allowing me to be who I am. Now I 
think I have ordinary self-doubt that 
anyone has, but it's not massive, 
inhibiting self-doubt that I used to 
have." 

Ordinary self-doubt. Perhaps a 
certain amount of despair is legitimate. 
Yo.ung adulthood has traditionally 
been seen as a time of confusion, of 
determining one's identity. Now sopte 
suggest that Prozac has the power to 
eliminate angst and foster pleasing 
emotions. Adolescent confusion may 
be seen as necessary for maturity, or as 
a discomfort easily eliminated through 
Prozac. An article on Prozac in the 
October issue of Lears says of students, 
"The brighter they are, the more they 
have achieved, the more competitive 
the school they're in, the more stressed 
they tend to become." Dr. Ghislaine 
Godenne, professor of psychiatry and 
director of counseling and psychiatric 
services at Johns Hopkins Universiry, 
told L~ar's that more than half of the 
students she has diagnosed with 
depression are prescribed Prozac. 

Dr. Lorraine Siggins, chief psychi-
atrist at UHS for five years and a 30-
year veteran of Mental Hygiene, states 
only that the department sees "rough-
ly" 12 percent of graduate students at 
Yale and ten percent of undergradu-
ates. She is unable to tell what percent-
age of those students are prescribed 
medication. "I can't say," she says, 
shaking her head, "because it really 
depends clinically on the person. It's 
really hard, you know, to make general 
statements." She says that Prozac has 
helped "a certain number of people," 
but she does not know how many. She 
stresses, "You're talking about less than 
one percent of students." One percent 
of the undergraduate population is 
about 50 students. Many more, unmo-
tivated, unhappy, and undiagnosed, 
might wonder if Prozac is the miracle 
drug to improve their lives. 

There is no one set of regulations 
at Yale concerning the treatment of 
students taking Prozac, according to 
Siggins. "It depends on each individu-
al. It depends on the person's condi-
tion." There is no minimum number 
of times patients must meet with their 
doctors. "If it seems helpful and some-
one's been on it for a while, it might 
make sense to see them every three to 
four weeks, or something like that," 
she says. "But more often the person is 
being prescribed the medication in the 
context of having therapy here on a 
weekly basis." 

Yale emphasizes therapy, not medi-
cation, she says. "Depending on what 
their problem is we try to help them 
understand it and to find ways of 
working out their concerns psychologi-
cally." She says doctors ask students 
questions about their symptoms and 
personal history prior to prescribing 
medication. 

Dr. Dennis Charney, chief of psy-
chiatry at the West Haven Veterans 
Medical Center, and associate chair-
man for research in the department of 
psychology, resorts to prescribing 
Prozac only if therapy has not been 
effective. "If you've worked with the 
patient and tried to work through 
issues and can't come up with anything 
and psychotherapy has not been help-
ful, and given that Prozac is a safe med-
ication," he says, "I might use it to 
lift the patient's persistent sad-
ness." He says that this is a 
standard practice but, "you 
wouldn't typically use Prozac 
in a person who said, 'You 
know I'm not sad, I just 
don't feel like I've realized 
my potential in life."' 

Dr. Larry Price, assis-
tant professor of psychiatry 
and 
director of Clinical 
Neuroscience Research Unit at the 
Connecticut Medical Health Center, 
agrees. "We'd rather not give people 
medication if they don't need it," he 
says. "Especially among college stu-
dents under unique stresses having to 
do with being away for the first time, 
being with a new peer group." In this 
case he favors talk therapy instead. 

Lilly spokesperson Kelly Weston 
offers, "For ethical reasons we can only 
promote the use of the medication for 
what it's indicated for-depression. " 
She adds t~at the FDA is determining 
if Prozac can be prescribed for obses-
sive-compulsive disorder or bulimia. 
She expects them to approve treat-
ment, but until then Prozac is only 
intended for treating depression. 

Unlike psychiatrists and Lilly, gen-
eral praccictioners may not be so con-
servative in prescribing psychotropic 
drugs. Patients go to their regular pri-
mary care provider and say they are not 
feeling happy, have heard about Prozac, 
and would like to try it. Since Prozac 
has few serious side effects, the doctor 
risks little in prescribing Prozac to the 
patient, even if he or she does not fit 
the traditional definition of clinically 
depressed. What are the ramifications 
of someone being able to go to an 
M.D. and receive a prescription for 
Prozac, saving the doctor the time of 
talking about the problem with the 
patient, and saving the patient the time 
of talking about it with a therapist? It is 
not a "scheduled" drug, which means 
the FDA does not regard it as poten-
tially harmful or addictive like mor-
phine, 
heroin, 
or 
Valium. 
Scheduled drugs require a 
triplicate prescription, 
one for the pharmicist, 
one for the doctor, 
and one for the State 
Department 
of 
Health. Prozac needs 
one prescription; dis-
pensing is straight-
forward and simple. 

Kramer questions 
Prozac's use for 
"healthy" people. 
He coined the term "cosmetic psy-
chopharmacology" for the world 
Prozac portends, a world in which 
individuals can change their personali-
ties through drugs to meet society's ide-
als, a world in which people ingest 
mood-enhancing drugs just as some 
athletes inject steroids to achieve. 

Prozac's effects on "normal" peo-
ple-people who feel their mood could 
be improved-remains unclear; but it 
is definite that Prozac dramatically 
helps many who fit the standard defini-
tion of depression. Jack hopes to return 
to Yale next year, aware it is not the 
ideal environment for a depressed per-
son. "It's a stressful place with high 
expectations," he says "and not neces-
sarily the most nurturing atmosphere." 

Prozac's potential to enhance 
mood and efficiency lures us all. 
Anyone would be attracted to a drug 
that makes students more apt to face 
the dreary New Haven rains, withstand 
stress, and smile while doing it. Prozac 
has only been around for five.years. If 
Prozac cannot make people better than 
normal, the possibility remains that 
another wonder drug will soon arrive, 
luring students tempted by the 
prospect of psychological perfection.
