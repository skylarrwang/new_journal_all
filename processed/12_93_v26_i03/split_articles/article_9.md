Selling New Haven 
Melissa Mosko[ 
T
im Shriver is full of plans these days. He's cleared 
everything off his desk to direct preparations for the 
1995 Special Olympics World Games. From his 
office on the sixteenth floor of the New H aven Savings 
Bank Building, he looks out over the Green and envisions a 
city mobilized to host more than 500,000 spectators. 
Winning the bid that will 
bring the Games to New H aven 
did not come easily. Boston and 
Miami both wanted the Games, 
but a small group of New 
Haveners outdid their rivals. Their 
enthusiasm and perseverence even 
overcame local skeptics. "People 
would come up to me after meet-
ings," Shriver remembers. "They 
would ask, 'Why are you trying to 
do this for New Haven? What 
does New H aven have to offer?"' 
Shriver and his colleagues have 
two years to prove that they have 
an answer. 

In the office directly below 
Shriver's, promoting New Haven 
does not center around a single 
event. At the Greater New Haven 
Chamber of Commerce, it is a 
long-term, multi-dimensional 
task. Representatives of local busi-
ness 
groups, 
lobbyists, 
and 
Chamber employees crowd togeth-
er in o ne office to plan for the 
rejuvenation of New Haven. 
Working 
closely 
with 
the 
Connecticut State Legislature, the 
New Haven's tourist industry. 

Across the nation, cities like New Haven are honing 
their images, selling themselves as meccas for tourists. 
Everyone knows the slogans "I love New York" and 
"Virginia is for lovers." New H aven's promoters do their 
best to heighten chances that the city will bounce back 
from economic depression. They 
recognize that social and econom-
ic problems plague the city, but 
they still see a glimmer of possibil-
ity. 

The promoters' optimism per-
meates the image they sell. They 
package the city as a little bit of 
everything; you want it, we've got 
it. Rather than catering to specific 
interests like Mystic seaside tradi-
tion or Williamsburg's living his-
tory, advocates for the city believe 
that there is nothing that New 
Haven cannot offer. Jim Harvey, 
general manager for the H oliday 
Inn-Yale University said, "New 
H aven is a multi-cultural city that 
has a lot of activities for its size. 
It's kind of like a little New York 
City."

"Today the theatre district is 
the entertainment center of the 
State of Connecticut," reads a 
brochure produced by the 
Schiavone 
Realty 
Development Corporation. "The 
24-hour activity on the streets of 
the theatre district is testimony 
to the rebirth of this important 
and historical neighborhood in 
favorable business environment 
that will promote growth and development in the city. In 
1992, they launched a two-year, half-million-dollar adver-
tising campaign entitled "Get to Know New Haven." 

But that's not all the city's doing. New H aven created 
the Convention and Visitors' Information Bureau 
(CVIB) this past July to supplement the over-worked 
staff at the Chamber. The CVIB designs brochures, con-
vention packages, tours, and guides to promote growth in

Publicizing high culture never fails to attract potential 
tourists, and New Haven highlights its theater and muse-
ums with this in mind. Yale's free museums offer tourists a 
chance co see internationally-known collections. The 
Department of Cultural Affairs even goes so far as to pub-
lish a guide for tourists entitled "Public Art in New 
Haven," to explain the various sculptures and statues

around the city. The New Haven Jazz 
Festival, premier symphonies, and 
nationally-celebrated theater companies 
are other highlights of city culture, 
according to the promoters. 

Promoters also focus on remnants

Chapel Street leave shoppers with few 
options. Theaters remain dark a few 
nights each week, becoming lively only 
on some weekend 
evenings. The num-' 
ber of suburban 
shoppers in the city 
dwindles, leaving sales clerks and wait-
resses idle. John O'Ricco, co-owner of 
Raggs Fashions for Men, sums up this 
problem. "When we moved our store 
from Westville to New Haven, we lost 
almost all of our Woodbridge busi-
ness," he said. "People don't want to 
come into the city to shop." 

town New Haven. Restaurants and 
entertainers from all over the region 
come to the Festival to sell their goods 
and advertise the city. Discussing the 
Street Festival's economic possibility, 
Frances Baker, owner of Sugar 
Magnolia commented, "I definitely 
think it was helpful. People came back 
to us saying they discovered us at the 
Festival." 

While special events do attract 
·tourists to the citf, their success in pro-
moting New Haven itself seems limit-
ed. The events last for fixed periods of 
time. They do not benefit the overall 
economy of the city significantly 
enough to impress potential business 
investors. 

Statistics present viable reason for 
concern about the New Haven behind 
the image-making. In 1991, 34 people 
were murdered in New Haven, just one 
fewer than in Jersey City, a city with 
99,000 more people than New Haven. 
That same year, 9.3 percent of blacks 
and 5.3 percent of whites were unem-
ployed. Despite varied promotion pro-
jects, poverty and violence persist 
underneath the slick brochures.
