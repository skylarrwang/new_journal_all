"friend, a good girl friend, I would have 
to tell her about my life, and I ~ldn't 
tell anyone about my life, so I didn't 
make any friends outside of the few 
tight ones I had." 

I nod sympathetically, bur I begin 
to feel a little sordid. I haven't thought 
much about what Hazel's life must 
have been like, so I haven't considered 
how telling me about it might make 
her feel. The thought occurs to me 
that if I had a microphone and an 
'1 would stand in line 
with people at his office 
hours and they were 
going in to .ask him 
about a paper, and I 
was going in to ask him 
where we were going to 
dinner that night. ,, 

audience, I could be Geraldo Rivera, 
always pressing a litde harder to get 
the juicy details. But Hazel doesn't 
seem to mind talking, so I ask what it 
was like to go home for Christmas. It 
turns out that shame and inexplicable 
phone bills were her biggest problems, 
and that she hated lying to her parents. 
"The entire reason I was ashamed was 
because I had to lie and be secret. I 
had absolutely no shame that I was 
seeing this older man." 

My Geraldo complex tempered, I 
want to know more of those details. 
Did yo'u fight much? I ask. Hazel 
smirks, exhales a gray cloud, and nods 
rapidly, emphatically. "Yeah, we 
fought. 
"We had very dramatic fights-! 
would try to leave him, and it was 
always high drama. One of the things 
we always said was, I would always say, 
'Oh, you're my father figure' and he 
would say, 'You're my mid-life crisis.' 
And we would just laugh because it 
was true. We knew it was true. 
"We had a fight once where-
a 
big fight-and I was basically going to 
call it off. It was about three or four 
months into the relationship and I 
went to his office and there were stu-
dents waiting in line for office hours 
and I went in and shut the door and I 
whispered, 'You'v~ blown it.' And we 
tried to have this huge fight , and 
meanwhile the whole department was 
all around and there were students 
outside and nobody knew what was 
going on. It was potentially a bad situ-
ation." Like she said, I think, high 
drama. 

By spring of her freshman year, 
she says, they felt "completely com-
plicit in each others lives. I can't make 
friends because I can't tell people and 
he's got his own single professor life, 
papers to grade, things like that .... I 
was sleeping at his house almost every 
night. We had a very domestic thing-
you know, have dinner, watch TV, do 
some work, go to bed. It wasn't as 
exciting as everyone would make it out 
to be. At all." 

If it wasn't exciting, it was making 
Hazel deeply unhappy. "I was so 
attached to him. It was a bit of a co-
dependent relationship in the sense 
that I was so miserable feeling I had to 
lie and not feeling like I could make 
any friends and I wasn't leading the life 
I should be .... I ran to the comfort of 
his arms, and in retrospect I can say I 
was confused and looking for security 
and really crazy about this guy and I 
sort of ran to him and got so hooked 
up in this side world .... Instead of 
dealing with all the problems you have 
as a freshman, I just kind of shoved it 
all aside. I knew that I was doing that 
and it made me very, very sad .... But I 
would not say that I regret my experi-
ence at all. I learned so much from it." 

As unhappy as she was, Hazel says 
she never blamed Professor X. "I still 
haven't changed my mind. I have to be 


responsible for my own actions." This 
responsibility included knowing that 
she would have co make a break soon. 
The process was complicated, she 
explains, because, "We were sort of 
each ocher's solace and misery at the 
same time. 
"It ended fall of my sophomore 
year. I went our with him for over a 
year. I went away for the summer, far 
away. I kept in couch .... I kept talking 
to him, and I was just miserable. I had 
decided char he was the end-all, be-all 
of my life and I realize now that I was 
sort of unhealthily obsessed about him 
too much .... He became a figure for all 
these conflicting feelings in me. I came 
back to school and .. .I had new room-
mates, and one was very social, and I 
started going out with her more and 
tried to separate myself a little. I real-
ized how bad the situation was. I 
couldn't lead this double life. I couldn't 
have him pick me up blocks away 
from the center of campus. I couldn't 
'live the lie' anymore. It wasn't good 
'1 do not believe in 
trying to legislate 
sexuality.... I think 
that's wrong. I especially 
don't think it's the 
university's job. " 

for me. It wasn't just 18-year-old and 
40-year-old stuff, a lot of it was just 
having an unhealthy relationship." 

W:
en it was all over, Hazel 
ays, "H e understood. He 
knew all along. He's not 
stupid. He's an older and wiser guy. 
"In terms of having these student-
professor relationships, I didn't think it 
was a problem because he wasn't teach-
ing me. And I think that people have co 
be trustworthy on their own accord 
not to involve sex and grades-that's 
just .... " Hazel trails off, but her 
meaning is clear. "And sex was not the 
focus of our relationship. I do not 
~elieve in trying to legislate sexuality, 
whether it be homosexuality, whether 
it be this sort of relationship, whatev-
er-! think that's wrong. I especially 
don't think it's the university's job to 
do that. Granted, that is placing a lot 
of faith in the student body and pro-
fessors, that people aren't going to 
abuse that. I think it's wrong when a 
professor, or TA, or someone who's 
grading somebody goes out. I think 
that's wrong, but I'm still not sure if 
it's good to try to regulate chat." 

Hazel has definite opinions about 
the taboos that kept her relationship 
in the closet. Without them, "We 
wouldn't have gone out as long as we 
did .... Because it was so 'illicit' I had 
to separate myself from my normal 
life, and it was ultimately more hurt-
ful to me. It might have been the 
fling I had originally envisioned it as, 
if it could have been out in the open. 
And that's the exact problem with the 
taboo on these kinds of relationships, 
because you can create a secrecy and a 
shame that's just going to draw peo-
ple together .... Whoever makes these 
rules should know. If you love some-
body, you love somebody, and to feel 
ashamed of that and feel like that's 
your only prize in life is only going to 
make you fall into it more." 

Hazel and I return to her role in 
initiating the relationship. I think 
about words like pursuit and seduc-
tion, but they don't seem co fit. 
Perhaps sensing chat my mind is wan-
dering, Hazel grows emphatic. "I 
made this happen. He had to be con-
vinced. He was not a lecherous pro-
fessor who was chasing my skirt at all. 
I convinced him chat we were attract-
ed to each other and this would be an 
interesting thing. Later I said 'I went 
into it with my eyes wide open.' I 
take full responsibility." She pauses. 

"But, because of his age and expe-
rience, and to some degree his 
posmon, 
his 
eyes 
were 
inevitably wider open chan 
mine. Make of that what you 
will. Does that mean that I 
blame him? Not exactly. 
But I think, in retrospect, 
he might have been more 
insurmountable in push-
ing me away from him. I 
don't know, chat's hypo-
thetical." The way Hazel 
Â· explains it, leaning forward 
in her chair, it seems fair to 
me. 

Before I leave, Hazel 
offers one more lucid 
observation. "People are 
going to have.sex if they 
want co," she says, "and 
let's just hope chat 
they have th~ presence 
of mind to do it in the 
correct' context." 

H
azel's story pre-
sents one side of a 
complex debate; her 
experience seems to argue 
against the kind of regulation 
that 
schools 
such 
as 
Harvard, William and 
Mary, Amherst, Oberlin, 
Indiana University, and 
Stanford have recently 
enacted, according to 
an 
article 
in 
the 
September issue of Harper's. 
The language of these 
policies seems 
reflect the idea 
students 
need the university 
to protect them from 
the advances of profes-
sors. Several go so far as 
to state chat "voluntary 
consent by the student ... is 
suspect," in the words of the 
policy ac Tufts. 

Most of these regulations rec-
ognize the distinction between rela-
tionships like Hazel's and those situ-
ations where a professor becomes 
involved with a student in one of 
his or her classes; the latter 
offense can bring "disciplinary 
action" (Tufts) or in some 
cases "dismissal" (Amherst). 

Amherst, 
Oberlin, 
and 
Stanford warn professors 
against'amorous relation-
ships with any students, 
even those over whom 
they have no profession-
al responsibility. 

Yale's policy man-
ages to conflate a number 
of these issues in a corollary 
to the university's sexual 
haras~ment code: 
"Because of the spe-
cial trust and the inequality 
of status inherent in the 
teacher-student relationship, 
sexual relations between a 
reacher and his or her student, 
even when apparently founded 
on mutual consent, are poten-
tially coercive, and may be so 
regarded if a complaint of sexu-
al harassment arises. Therefore, 
those. who teach are advised to 
recognize the potential prob-
lems implicit in such relation-
ships and to avoid them. In a 
case where a complaint of sex-
ual harassment arises out of 
such a relationship, the facul-
ty member will bear the bur-
den of overcoming a presump-
tion that the activity was not 
consensual on the part of the 
student." 

In addition to running the 
risk of trivializing claims of 
outright sexual harassment, 
the policy exposes faculty 
members to serious risk by pre-
suming their guilt in such situa-
tions. Perhaps more importantly, 
it demeans the entire notion of 
consent by asserting that if the par-
