"When I first met him, every-
thing was totally legit, nor-
mal, whatever. He impressed me very 
much, but it wasn't until a while later, 
a long time later, that I actually decided 
to consider it. I decided to pursue him 
my freshman year-
when I first got to 
Yale. Well, 'pursue' is kind of a loaded 
term, but ...."

This is how Hazel, now an upperclassman, describes 
the beginnings of her first Yale romance. Her story sounds 
like a thousand others; like the others it features flirtation, a 
few pivotal glasses of wine, and a kiss that leads into some-
thing else. But for Hazel, "something else" meant a year and 
a half of subterfuge, a double life that separated her from 
friends, parents, and peers. Looking back, Hazel doesn't 
regret the experience. But she does admit that falling in love 
with a Yale professor, a man twice her age, changed her life. 
Her story offers a passionate perspective on the growing 
debate about the regulation of sexual relationships between 
students and faculty that has erupted on campuses across 
the nation. Her words also provide a window into an aspect 
of the Yale experience that many whisper about, but few 
have the courage to discuss openly. 

Hazel agreed to an interview somewhat skittishly. She 
tells me her story only under condition of complete 
anonymity-not so much for herself, she says, but to pro-
tect the man she will only refer to as "Professor X." She 
urges me to be careful, reminds me to watch for details that 
might give anything away. "He knows right now that I'm 
talking to you and he's very worried about it, and I 
promised him that I would be reasonable. But yeah, we're 
on good terms now." We sit in Hazel's airy room on a bright 
fall day; a gentle breeze blows in through an open window. 
She is at ease, but chooses her words carefully. 

"We went out to dinner to talk about normal student-
professor things. There was no idea in our minds-or at 
least in his mind-that there was anything more than 
that .... When I made my intentions known [the second 
time we went to dinner], I think he was a little surprised .... 
At that point I realized that he was interested, but I don't 
think we took it very seriously .... Sort of flirting with a stu-
dent, but it wasn't going to lead to anything, you know?" 

Hazel interrupts the narrative of those first days to 
underscore what is, to her, the crucial fact in their story. 
"Let me just say first-let me be very clear about this-
he was not teaching me, he was not giving me a grade, in 
my mind there was absolutely no ethical problem whatsoev-
er .... It's not like he was a person who was giving me a grade 
or being my advisor or anything like that. It wasn't a ques-
tion of that. 

"Afterwards, I went to his place for a night-
cap. I went to his place, and before we 
went inside he said, 'Hazel, do 
you realize what you're 
getting into?' 
And 
I 
said 
'Professor 
X, I'm just 
going in for 
a nightcap.' 
And that was 
sort 
of 
the 
divide. We went 
in for a nightcap, 
and it was very 
clear what was in 
my mind, and I 
kissed him. We kissed, 
then 
went 
home." Hazel pauses, 
takes a sip of her Diet 
Coke, and continues. "I 
was kind of in shock, like 'I can't believe I did this.' 

"I talked to him a couple of days later, and he was very 
concerned, very upset-you know, we had had some wine, 
obviously-and he said to me, 'We can't, this is bad for you, 
this is bad in terms of Yale, and I think this should be 
nipped in the bud. I like you a lot, but it's not fair to you.'"
