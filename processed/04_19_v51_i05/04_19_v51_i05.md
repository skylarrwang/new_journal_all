**Title: Dear readers,**

More than a week ago, over one thousand admitted students arrived on campus for the largest Bulldog Days ever. The 
wide-eyed prefrosh eagerly visited classes, ventured into student club events, and donned their Yale ponchos and drawstring 
backpacks in the rain. They also might have noticed a flurry of protests amid the festivities. Current students organized 
teach-ins and circulated petitions in support of bolstered resources and departmental status for the Ethnicity, Race, and 
Migration program. Activists with Students Unite Now camped outside SSS and blocked traffic in the middle of College 
Street, pushing for financial aid reform. And soon after the prospective students left, Yale and Hamden police officers 
shot at two unarmed Black local residents, Stephanie Washington and Paul Witherspoon. The shooting sparked mass 
demonstrations and raised questions about the University’s role in policing the city beyond its walls. 

We hope this issue, The New Journal’s 260th, inspires you to consider Yale’s place—and property—in New Haven and its 
lingering legacy of racial and socioeconomic exclusion. Inside, read about Yale’s unkept promise to hire more New Haven 
residents; the University’s controversial 185-year-old tax exemptions; the future of Asian American Studies at Yale; the local 
implications of a nationwide college admissions scandal; and more.

As our community reckons with Yale’s neglect for its ER&M program, the University’s broken pledge to hire from New 
Haven, and the shots a campus police officer fired at innocent and unarmed civilians, we head into summer reminded that 
work for a more inclusive future remains. 

Thanks for reading, and please don’t hesitate to drop us a line! 

In friendship,

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Just west of Yale’s West Campus, 
past the condo complex and the 
Restaurant Depot on Edison Road, past 
the candy roll-shaped signs blaring “PEZ 
PEZ PEZ” at oncoming trafﬁc, past the 
glass ticket booth where you exchange ﬁve-
dollars-plus-tax for a raspberry-red lanyard 
and a construction-paper I.D. designating 
you as an “Adult $5.00,” is a pedestal. On 
that pedestal, which rises to a height you’d 
consider chest-high if you were a Child 
3-12 $4.00 instead of an Adult $5.00, is a 
round blue button. If you press that button, 
nothing happens. 

Then, out of nowhere, from the top of 
what you assumed was just a blue load-
bearing pillar, a giant baseball-capped 
head lurches backward, revealing, where 
its neck should be, a massive hole, out of 
which emerges the largest piece of PEZ 
candy you’ve ever seen, a veritable bathtub 
that looks like it’s going to plop out of the 
pillar and pulverize you. The tub teeters, 
half-ejected, holding your life in its candied 
hands. Then it retreats back into its hole, 
shrouded by the blue-billed head that 
returns to its pike with a knowing smirk. 
That’s how I meet PEZ Boy, who, 
at fourteen feet tall, is the largest PEZ 
dispenser in the world. He’s one of the 
main attractions at the PEZ Visitor Center 
in Orange, Connecticut, which abuts the 
only PEZ factory in North America. After 
we meet, I stuff my identiﬁcation card in 
my pocket and try to blend into the crowd 
of families and expert PEZHeads who have 
decided to spend their Saturday afternoons 
at a candy museum. 

In 1927, Eduard Haas III of 
Austria 
began 
marketing 
his 
PfeffErminZ, or peppermints, as 
alternatives to smoking. In the 
1950s, PEZ-Haas, Inc. got out of 
the adult breath mint business, 
got into the kids’ candy business, 
and moved its headquarters to 
New York City. PEZ bricks, like 
Tic Tacs and Werther’s Originals, 
look more at home in medicine 
cabinets than in plastic pumpkin 
heads, and yet Americans now 
eat three billion of them a year. To satiate that 
demand, the company has developed cutting-
edge ﬂavors like Coffee, Chlorophyll, Menthol/
Eucalyptus, and Yogurt. Of course, the candies 
have always played second ﬁddle to their 
containers, the Batman-, Mickey Mouse-, and 
Santa Claus-headed dispensers ﬁrst introduced by 
Oscar Uxa at the 1948 Vienna Trade Fair. Flick 
the kicker on the nape of Batman’s neck and out 
comes chalky candy stored in the stem where his 
body should be. 

The Orange factory opened in 1974. Its Visitor 
Center came along in 2011, after professional 
PEZ historian Shawn Peterson, voted 2010’s 
PEZHead of the Year by previous winners, 
convinced PEZ’s CEO to open a four thousand-
square-foot museum in the middle of suburban 
Connecticut. Peterson, now the center’s business 
manager, ﬁlled its exhibits with dispensers from 
his personal collection. 

I walk by gold dispensers, Groot dispensers, 
Garﬁeld the Cat dispensers, Garﬁeld the President 
dispensers, unrealistically light-skinned Barack 
Obama 
dispensers, 
unrealistically 
attractive 
Richard Nixon dispensers, no-foot dispensers, 
thin-foot dispensers, thick-foot dispensers, and 
dispensers on functional four-inch heels. I step 
over dispensers embedded in glass ﬂoor displays, 
which remind me of similar displays in the 
documentary Hell House. Except in Hell House, 
the sinful teenagers trapped in the ﬂoor could 
scream and thrash against the glass, whereas these 
voiceless and limbless Hello Kitties can only stare 
up and smile at the Sketchers of their oppressors. 
By oppressors, I mean a) the children who 
are surprisingly excited about moderately edible 
chalk contained in non-edible plastic, and b) their 
parents, who presumably fondly remember the 
same chalk and plastic from their childhoods. One 
guy, who has clearly been to the Visitor Center 
multiple times, gives two women the grand tour, 
dropping impressive amounts of PEZ knowledge 
and asking questions like, “Did you see the little 
winking Pikachu?” If I were part of the PEZHeads 
Email Discussion Group—the PEZ equivalent 
of the Electoral College—I’d vote for him to be 
April’s PEZHead of the Month.

It’s immediately obvious, meanwhile, 
that I’m bad at PEZ. I don’t know 
a spine from a sleeve, or a 
leaf spring from a plastic 
hinge pin. I score an 
eleven out of twenty 
on 
the 
interactive 
PEZ trivia game. 
I reach the back-
corner eleVader 
(named for the 
foot-tall 
Darth 
Vader surveilling 
entrance), 
read 
its 
instructions (“Step 1: Raise your arms. Step 2: Say 
‘Weeeee!’”), consider myself unworthy, and walk 
to the other side of the museum to take the stairs. 
Somewhere by the second-ﬂoor sign asking, “How 
many grasshoppers tall are you?” it dawns on me 
that not only am I bad at PEZ, but I will also never, 
ever, be good at PEZ. I’ll never be a PEZHead. I 
don’t have the nostalgia, the tinkering mindset, 
or the self-conﬁdence required to go around 
telling people you collect decapitated snowmen, 
Supermen, and Rutherford B. Hayeses. Like any 
good American Studies major, I compensate by 
turning insigniﬁcant details into thesis sentences 
like: “The generally phallic appearance of the 
‘Naughty Neil’ dispenser, coupled with suggestive 
Visitor Center advertising slogans like ‘The candy 
with a playmate!,’ suggests a penile obsession at 
the heart of American corporate capitalism.”

None of which helps me when I try to buy 
Captain Marvel dispensers from the laid-back gift 
shop clerk. “Are you just here to buy things today?” 
he asks, with all the coolness reserved for people 
who stand three feet from Secret Life of Pets™ 
memorabilia. Overwhelmed, I answer “yes,” even 
though my journey through the museum makes 
the answer a clear “no,” which in turn makes it 
weird when I pull out my Adult $5.00 museum 
I.D. to take advantage of the $2.00 credit on all 
same-day gift shop purchases. The guy stares 
straight through me to the kicker on the nape of 
my neck and says, “Oh, so you weren’t just here 
for the store,” which I parry with something like 
“yeah,” to which he responds with something like 
“O.K.” while bringing the price of ﬁve dispensers 
down to a trim $8.45. 

I 
escape 
the center and wait for my 
Uber at the PEZ-
colored 
picnic 
tables 
by 
parking lot. A kid of 
about 
kindergarten 
age waits impatiently 
for his mom to snap a 
family photo underneath 
the “PEZ PEZ PEZ” sign, 
then darts toward the front 
entrance. Once his dad gets off 
his phone and opens the door to the 
lobby, the kid shouts, “Whoaaaa! There’s 
a PEZ bench!”

“No wayyy!” his mom yells back, mock-excited, 
while throwing something away by the tables. As 
my Uber driver asks me if I’m just getting off work 
at the factory, and further asks me if I’d like to join 
his free-or-reduced-price home energy scheme, I 
imagine the kid reacting to PEZ Boy. I start to 
wish I were less like his parents, and more like 
him.

**Title: NEW BOOKS ON THE BLOCK**
**Author: Lakshmi Amin**
**Page number(s): 6**

The 
pre-recorded 
sound 
of 
a 
harpsichord plucking along to a Baroque 
string ensemble mingles with the smell 
of old pages and wooden bookshelves. Lingering 
near the front door of Grey Matter Books, I watch 
as mid-afternoon light reﬂects off cars lining 
York Street and illuminates piles of secondhand 
books and 1930s Travel magazines that cover the 
surface of the broad windowsill. A middle-aged 
man wearing a green button-down shirt, store 
owner Sam Burton squints at a book through a 
pair of thin glasses pushed to the end of his nose. 
He greets me with an amused smile but glances 
back at the books at his side, explaining that he’s 
in the middle of making a purchase. While I 
wait, I wander over to the arts section and pick 
up a collection of Swedish artist Ulrica Hydman 
Vallien’s paintings: humans rendered in bold 
strokes and bright colors, concealed within a jet-
black jacket cover.

Grey Matter Books opened the doors of its New 
Haven store in late February of this year. You 
might have to squint before you notice the small 
sign in the front window, which features a black-
and-white image of a brain growing from a stem, 
enclosed by a thin circle. 

The bookseller asks if Burton could go any 
higher on his offer for the used books, then 
reluctantly takes one of the crates back into his 
arms. Burton turns to sit down across from me at 
a table buried in more books and faces the sun-
ﬁlled front window, surveying the busy sidewalk 
with distracted glances. 

Though Burton’s own preferences in literature 
ranges from philosophy to ﬁlm, Burton clariﬁes, 
“I don’t think the mission, per se, is to inﬂict my 
taste on people.” The Grey Matter website’s guide 
for booksellers features the store’s “No-go’s” list, 
which states that “the world is choking on its 
copies of The Girl with The Pearl Earring and The 
Da Vinci Code,” among others. On the other hand, 
“The Always and Near-Always Want List” contains 
eight categories including “handsome editions of 
the classics,” “raising chickens; keeping bees,” 
and “basically anything experimental, or else just 
plain good.” These criteria have “been whittled 
down through years of buying and selling,” Burton 
says. He worked at The Strand in New York and 
at independent bookstores across three states 
before opening the ﬁrst Grey Matter in Hadley, 
Massachusetts, ten years ago. “Throwing away 
books is a very important thing,” he tells me. “You 
don’t want the shelves to be stale.”

One round through the store reveals old and 
new, mainstream and niche occupying the same 
shelves. Burton’s eye for the eclectic has curated 
an unusual collection of books that encourages 
customers to jump into unfamiliar literary 
territory. In corporate chain bookstores, autopilot 
steers me straight towards the textbook section, 
or the “kids” section, or, more realistically, the 
in-store Starbucks. I often leave with exactly 
what I came looking for—nothing more, nothing 
less. Instead, Grey Matter beckons me to take 
some time and explore sprawling rows of shelves 
housing unknown genres.

A few days later and a few blocks away, Dave 
Duda, owner of the Book Trader Cafe, sits with me 
in the store’s glass atrium. Downtown New Haven 
was home to ﬁve other independent bookstores 
when he ﬁrst opened his own twenty-three years 
ago, but now, of the ﬁve, only the Book Trader 
Cafe and Atticus Bookstore Cafe remain. “The 
internet basically happened while we’ve been here, 
so we’ve done a lot of evolving,” he comments. 
When book sales alone could not sustain the 
store, Duda expanded food offerings and adjusted 
prices to “mesh with the times.” Nodding to the 
used books sprawled across the main counters, he 
jokes that after the debut of Marie Kondo’s Netﬂix 
show Tidying Up, his inventory is fuller than it’s 
been in a while. Even so, he says that “something

Grey Matter, a used bookstore in New Haven, offers a unique collection of books that draws in customers seeking rare and hard-to-find titles.  Owner Ben Burton's passion for literature is evident in his carefully curated selection, which contrasts with the impersonal nature of large chain bookstores.  He expresses concern about the loss of the sense of community and exploration that he feels


Burton hopes to create a space where customers can discover literature and connect with others who share his passion. He acknowledges the challenges of running a bookstore in a high-rent area and the need to adapt to customers' needs.  The store's eclectic selection seems to be attracting a diverse clientele, including a tourist who found a rare first edition and a student excited to find a unique zine.  


An employee, Cameron Brown, highlights the store's remarkable selection, showcasing a favorite find: a visually stunning homage to poet Kenneth Patchen. Burton reflects on the differences between running his store in Hadley and in New Haven, highlighting the unique character of the city and the challenges of managing two bookstores simultaneously.  He concludes by jokingly remarking that it’s “definitely not for the faint of spine.”


**Bribery and Broken Trust**
**Author: Mark Rosenberg**
**Page number(s): 8-9**

In the fall of 2017, a women’s soccer recruit from California with a forged athletic profile was admitted to Yale.  The following May, when Rudy Meredith, head coach of the Yale women’s soccer team, formally announced his 2022 recruiting class on the Yale Athletics website, the California recruit was missing from the list. Yale didn’t seem to notice. But federal investigators did. This March, prosecutors indicted Meredith, along with forty-nine other people, for participating in a sprawling bribery scheme in the Justice Department’s largest-ever college admissions investigation.


Yale’s admissions process is to blame. According to Senior Associate Athletics Director Brian Tompkins, the University does not independently verify recruits’ athletic credentials—a loophole that administrators say Athletic Director Vicky Chun has been working to fix. And while Harvard interviews all admitted athletes, Yale has no comparable protocol in place. In an interview with The New Journal, Tompkins described the interaction between coaches and admissions officers as “a trust relationship.” That relationship broke down when Meredith accepted a $400,000 bribe to recruit an applicant who didn’t play soccer at all.


The admissions scandal made two things clear. First, varsity coaches at Yale hold disproportionate clout in the admissions process—enough to command the equivalent of over five years’ worth of tuition, room, and board for a bad-faith recruiting slot. And second, these days, the ultra-rich will go to almost any lengths to secure a spot for their child at an elite college. The parents of the aforementioned recruit paid William “Rick” Singer, the owner of the fraudulent college preparatory company at the center of the scheme, a total of $1.2 million; the following April, Meredith met with Los Angeles financial executive Morrie Tobin, who was acting as an FBI informant in exchange for leniency in a securities fraud case, and offered to designate Tobin’s daughter as a recruit for $450,000.


For wealthy parents hoping to bribe their children’s way into Yale or another Ivy League school, athletic recruitment would be an obvious route. For one, Yale’s academic admissions standards for prospective athletes are more lenient than those for other students. Admissions officers place recruits on a 240-point scale based on GPA and standardized test scores in accordance with the Ivy League’s “Academic Index” system. The score of each athletic recruiting class, across all sports, can’t be less than one standard deviation below the entire student body’s score. The athletic department assigns each team an average score to hit, according to Chris Gobrecht, who coached the Yale women’s basketball team from 2005 to 2015. Gobrecht said sports like tennis and golf that tend to recruit students from wealthy private schools are given higher target scores than sports like basketball, which recruit more heavily from public schools.


According to The Harvard Crimson, Harvard admits 83 percent of athletes with top academic ratings on an internal scale, compared to 16 percent of non-athletes with the same ratings. Yale’s admissions office declined to provide data for this story. “A coach’s endorsement by no means guarantees admission,” Dean of Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid Jeremiah Quinlan said through a spokesperson. “Yale and the Ivy League closely regulate the admissions criteria for student athletes.” An admissions committee reviews each recruit’s application, just as they do for non-athlete applicants, and recruits’ academic credentials are vetted rigorously from the moment coaches contact them. Allison Guth, head coach of the Yale women’s basketball team, wrote in an email, “After identifying a student-athlete we think would fit our style of play and culture, we immediately request transcripts and test scores.”


Throughout the admissions process, coaches communicate with a liaison assigned to their team by the admissions office, who advises the coach on the recruit’s likelihood of admittance. After each recruit’s junior year, coaches send the liaison an academic portfolio, which includes the applicant’s transcript and standardized test scores. Coaches also submit a letter in which they describe the recruit’s character, background, and athletic accomplishments, including statistics and accolades. In the fall, the admissions office reviews the recruit’s full application during the early admission period.


Verifying recruits’ athletic credentials, however, is completely left up to coaches. According to Tompkins, neither the athletic department nor the admissions office currently conducts an outside review of applicants’ athletic qualifications. An FAQ about the scandal published on Yale’s website states that going forward, the athletics department will review each coach’s recruits before their applications are sent to admissions, and “situations in which a recruited athlete fails to make a team will receive close scrutiny.”


Gobrecht, the former Yale women’s basketball coach, said it was rare that her recruits were denied admission, especially once she became familiar with the admissions office’s academic expectations. But she noted that admissions reviewed her recruits’ portfolios carefully. “This is not a rubber stamp kind of thing at all,” she said. Gobrecht estimated that “once every three or four years,” the admissions office would notify her of a red flag in a recruit’s application, such as a concern with a teacher recommendation.


Singer didn’t send Meredith the California recruit’s doctored profile until mid-November, after Yale’s early application deadline. (He’d removed an art portfolio the recruit had compiled and falsely described her as “the co-captain of a prominent club soccer team in southern California,” according to court filings.) Even on a tight timetable, and without consulting the women’s soccer team’s liaison the prior summer, Meredith was able to secure the fake recruit’s admission. This further suggests that Yale’s vetting process, while rigorous, is far from airtight.


Still, both Tompkins and Grant Bronsdon, who worked for two years as an assistant director in the admissions office after he graduated in 2016, said that Meredith was an outlier. “This kind of thing happened because one coach was able to be more separate from the process and act with an utter disregard for the integrity of the process,” Bronsdon said.


But Gobrecht said that Yale’s elite reputation renders the recruiting process more susceptible to manipulation. “I think just from the standpoint of the demographics of who’s attracted to [Yale], the big money and the wealth and the fame…you can see why it might be possible for something like [the scandal] to happen,” she said.


Even if Yale institutes additional oversight for athletic admissions, as administrators have promised, the bribery scandal has brought newfound attention to the role athletic recruitment plays at elite institutions like Yale. Admissions advantages for athletes—particularly those who are recruited for costly sports prevalent at Ivy League schools, like sailing and lacrosse—disproportionately aid wealthy white students. According to a survey conducted by The Harvard Crimson, 46.3 percent of recruited athletes in Harvard’s class of 2022 have a family income over $250,000, compared to 32.8 percent of the class at large. At Yale, 279 of the 297 varsity athletes on the lacrosse, sailing, ice hockey, and crew teams—94 percent—are white. Meredith’s deception might have been an anomaly, but as debates over affirmative action intensify, Yale still has a tougher set of questions about athletic admissions left to answer.

**Title: A Stranger in the Village**

C
asey Gerald’s memoir gets its title 
from a story Gerald found on Tumblr 
about a village in France blessed 
with miracles. In the village, the peasants stop 
working, hoping that the miracles will replace 
their labor in providing food and clothes 
for everyone. The aristocrats, fearing this 
insurgency, erect a sign that declares: “There 
will be no miracles here by order of the king.” 
Gerald tells his own story in his 2018 memoir 
There Will Be No Miracles Here, in which he 
characterizes himself as a peasant boy from 
Dallas, Texas. There Will Be No Miracles Here 
examines the cost of prosperity and provides a 
scathing critique of elitist institutions like Yale, 
the aristocracy in Gerald’s own story.


Gerald wore ripped black skinny jeans to his 
Morse College Tea on April 12, hosted in a small 
reception room with plush red carpets and floor-
to-ceiling windows. He wore a black turtleneck 
and a faded denim jacket that was a size too big 
on purpose. His red and white Nike sneakers 
were the focal point of his look—one that fit 
in with the dozens of students chatting quietly 
and passing around copies of his memoir, which 
was published in 2018. With a lilting Southern 
accent and a wide smile that made you feel like 
you were in on the joke, Gerald introduced 
himself to anyone whose eyes met his. He 
explained that he began writing his book in his 
late twenties in order to find out why he was, 
as he puts it, “all cracked up”—a phrase that 
refers to feelings of fragmentation, unhappiness, 
and loneliness. “You don’t really know what you 
intend when you start [your memoir],” he said. 
“Don’t [write one] unless your life depends on 
it.”


At thirty-two years old, Gerald is an alumnus 
of both Yale College and Harvard Business 
School, an Ivy League football champion, a 
Rhodes Scholar Finalist, a viral TED speaker, 
and now, an author. Gerald grew up in South 
Oak Cliff (SOC), a low-income neighborhood 
in Dallas. In an interview with The New Journal, 
Tony Reno, head coach of the Yale football 
team, recalled walking into South Oak Cliff 
High School fifteen years ago through metal 
detectors. “At the time we recruited from all 
over the country. We knew that [Gerald ] was 
going to be different because of the environment 
he was coming from. It was drastically different 
from Yale,” Coach Reno said. Growing up, 
Gerald was unaware Yale even had a football 
team. Upon receiving a recruitment letter from 


“THERE WILL BE NO 
MIRACLES EXAMINES 
THE COST OF 
PROSPERITY, AND 
PROVIDES A SCATHING 
CRITIQUE OF ELITIST 
INSTITUTIONS LIKE 
YALE, THE ARISTOCRACY 
IN HIS OWN STORY.”
– Caroline Bennet is a ﬁrst-
year in Trumbull College.


Yale, he thought to himself, “Ain’t nobody from 
SOC ever gone to no school in  Connecticut—
where is [Connecticut] anyway?” But Gerald 
saw Yale as his chance to leave South Oak Cliff, 
one he could not pass up. 
He writes in his memoir that he accomplished 
everything he was supposed to: made a little 
money, played football, went to a good school, 
and fell in love (at least once). But the “success” 
he learned at Yale had its limitations. “I knew 
how to do an interview, give a speech, kind of 
write a book, but I had no idea about how to 
care for a human being,” he told his audience 
at Morse College. “The search [for success],” he 
writes, “has not yet killed me, though I am a bit 
deranged—and that may be the best that I have 
been in all these years.” In his memoir, Gerald 
recalls his struggles with racial, sexual, and 
political identities at Yale, even among other 
Black students. He remembers the compromises 
he felt he had to make to succeed in a community 
where galas, formals, and networking events are 
the norm. He writes, “The black students at Yale 
were a mighty rich discovery—not only because 
they had so much more or had lived so differently 
than I had, but also and especially because they 
looked at me as though they were itching to 
pose Du Bois’s question: ‘How does it feel to be 
a problem?’” Gerald spent his time at Yale trying 
to distract others from his race, his background, 
and his anger, in order to placate professors, 
advisors, and even classmates. During his first 
year, his academic advisor Penny Laurans, who 
was the chief aide to then President Rick Levin, 
admonished his hat and clothes, exclaiming, 
“Do you wear those things around campus? Oh, 
no, Casey. It’s just so stereotypical, you know? 
You’re at Yale now.” 
There Will Be No Miracles Here is not just 
a manifesto. It’s also a love story. Gerald 
investigates romantic love and heartbreak as a 
queer Black boy with little guidance, familial 
love, and self-love. He remembers falling in 
love with a boy from home during his time at 
Yale. “By love I do not mean the strong dramatic 
feelings that we see on television,” Gerald 
writes. “I found the prospect of needing a human 
being, trusting them, extending myself for them, 
to be more horrifying than being abandoned, or 
almost killed, or damned for all eternity. People 
seemed to be the most dangerous things in this 
world.” Under circumstances in which poverty, 
abandonment, and substance addiction are the 
norm, where self-respect and confidence are 
hard to come by, Gerald says, “the most radical 
thing [one] can do is be well.” 
Gerald writes about founding the Yale Black 
Men’s Union to combat his isolation from his 
own Black identity and to provide a space for 
Black students away from prejudice on campus. 
“Black love is a powerful thing,” he writes. “And 
on this night, love—or whatever the feeling was 
in the room—indeed seemed powerful, powerful 
enough to put genuine smiles on the boys and 
girls, powerful enough to satisfy another mantra 
we adopted in that first year of the Union: We 
measure success by the lives that we change.” 
There Will Be No Miracles Here breaks from the 
conventions of most memoirs. The chronology 
is sometimes ambiguous, and Gerald himself 
inhabits conflicting roles as narrator, protagonist, 
and antagonist. “I didn’t write a book to prove 
that I existed. I’m not on the outside looking in 
or the inside looking out. I am in the middle of 
my consciousness,” he declared in the crowded 
speaking room at Morse College. “Did you ever 
find the parts you lost?” a man in his sixties asked 
from the audience, his hand resting comfortably 
in his wife’s. Gerald paused for a few moments, 
thinking about the question. “Well, they came to 
find me,” he laughed. “I’m still in the recovery 
process, still trying to figure out what it means to 
love someone else.”

**Title: The Shifting Sands of Asian American Studies at Yale**

n early December, around sixty students sprawled 
out on the stairs and couches on the first floor of the 
Asian American Cultural Center for a Yale College 
Council (YCC) town hall intended to gauge student 
interest in an Asian American Studies program. On the 
wall in front of the couches hung a painting of Yung 
Wing, class of 1854, the first Chinese student to graduate 
from Yale, or any American university. Katherine Hu, a 
YCC senator, led the project and organized the town 
hall alongside American Studies professors Mary Lui 
and Gary Okihiro. During the gathering, students broke 
into small groups with these professors to express their 
particular interests in Asian American Studies, such as 
South Asian or Vietnamese literature; many were often 
inspired to participate by their family histories. The crowd 
of mostly Asian American students voiced excitement at 
the possibility of exploring South Asian literature or an 
introductory course in Asian American Studies—classes 
not yet offered at Yale. In mid-January, following the 
town hall, the YCC published an infographic, listing six 
new courses this spring under “Asian diaspora/migration 
courses” and “Asian American courses”—and three 
under “Ethnic Studies courses.”


Yet five months have passed since the town hall, and 
the conversation around Asian American Studies has 
radically changed. In early March, students formed 
a Coalition for Ethnic Studies to advocate for the 
University to provide the Ethnicity, Race, and Migration 
(ER&M) program with resources comparable to those of 
other departments. On Friday, March 29, thirteen senior 
faculty members withdrew from the ER&M program in 
protest of the major’s lack of departmental status and 
hiring power, as well as the denial of tenure to ER&M 
and American Studies professor Albert Laguna. ER&M 
now has no tenured professors, and no one with official 
leadership status. Many students have supported the 
thirteen faculty members’ decision, though, denouncing 
the University’s devaluing of their continued labor. 
In support of the ER&M professors, the Coalition for 
Ethnic Studies held a pop-up photo campaign, inviting 
students to Cross Campus to take pictures with brief 
statements describing their defense of ER&M. Over 
the next few days, students showed their solidarity with 
the ER&M faculty, sharing and resharing photos on 
social media. More than a thousand students signed 
a letter that circulated on social media in support of 
ER&M. Despite outpouring of student support for the 
program, President Peter Salovey has not conceded to 
the professors’ requests. 


This advocacy for ER&M is not divorced from 
discussions 
surrounding 
Asian 
American 
Studies 
courses. Many Asian American Studies courses found 
their institutional home in ER&M, and now with the 
program in flux, advocating for Asian American Studies 
has become part of a larger movement to defend and 
support Ethnic Studies at Yale. In many students’ and 
professors’ views,  Asian American Studies should not be 
siphoned off from the broader field of Ethnic Studies, 
given that the strength of ER&M lies in its intersectional 
and interdisciplinary approach. 


In light of the ER&M program’s uncertainty, talk 
of a standalone Asian American Studies program has 
all but died out; the focus has shifted to a broader 
intersectional movement in support of Ethnic Studies. 
As the conversation widens, new questions about the 
best way to institutionalize Asian American Studies have 
emerged: What are the costs and benefits of creating a 
discrete Asian American Studies department? How can 
Ethnic Studies give voice to Asian American Studies 
without subsuming the distinct identities encompassed 
by the term “Asian American”?  


In the spring of 1970, amid a flurry of political activism 
around the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, and 
the Bobby Seale and Black Panthers trial, the first course 
in Asian American Studies was offered at Yale. It was a 
residential college seminar in Timothy Dwight College, 
taught by Professor Chitoshi Yanaga, who was the first 
Japanese American tenured faculty member at Yale. 
The seminar, called “The Asian American Experience,” 
explored questions of Asian American identity formation 
and was the first Asian American-centered course to be 
offered by any Ivy League college. 


The Asian American Students Association (AASA), 
which formed one semester earlier  in the fall of 1969, 
THE  NEW  JOURNAL
 16
“How can Ethnic 
Studies give voice to 
Asian American Studies 
without subsuming 
the distinct identities 
encompassed by the 
term ‘Asian American’?”


worked to develop the course. Don Nakanishi, who 
founded the AASA, recalled that nearly one-third of all 
Asian American undergraduates at Yale enrolled in the 
seminar. In addition to helping create the course, the 
AASA formed an Asian American Studies Task Force 
(AASTF) to advocate for greater diversity in Yale’s 
curriculum. 


“While recognizing that Yale has made efforts to 
expand its course offerings related to East Asia, and 
specifically China and Japan, the AASTF asserts that 
similar attention needs to be given specifically to Asian 
American Studies,” the AASTF website states. Still, while 
the AASTF made efforts to increase course offerings in 
the following decades, faculty with extensive knowledge 
in the field were difficult to retain.  


Forty-five years later, there was a second surge in the 
movement for greater curricular diversity. By the 2014-
15 academic year, only one Asian American Studies 
course was offered at Yale, and only one Asian American 
Studies professor, Mary Lui, had tenure. In October of 
2014, Yale’s four Asian American Studies scholars—Lui, 
newly hired English professor Sunny Xiang, lecturer and 
novelist Susan Choi, and ER&M professor Quan Tran—
held a meet-and-greet that addressed the University’s 
failure to establish an Asian American Studies program 
or even to follow through on a promise it made in 1987 
to offer two courses in Asian American Studies per year. 
This was occurring alongside broader faculty diversity 
concerns—that year, multiple professors in African 
American Studies and ER&M left Yale. As students and 
faculty organized for the departmentalization of ER&M, 
the AASTF started a photo campaign to advocate for 
a wider array of Asian American Studies courses. The 
campaign featured Asian American undergraduate 
students standing on Cross Campus against a brick wall, 
holding signs displaying course names missing from 
Yale’s Blue Book: “Yale will not teach me contemporary 
narratives on the Philippines and the United States,” one 
read. “Yale will not teach me Asian American medical 
systems,” stated another. The photo campaign spurred 
the hiring of more Asian Americanist scholars such as 
Professors Daniel HoSang and Lisa Lowe and enabled 
a larger set of courses in Asian American Studies. That 
year, too, Yale announced a new initiative, providing $50 
million over the next five years to support the recruitment 
and development of an “excellent and diverse faculty.”


Soon thereafter, Yale began to prioritize the hiring of 
Asian American faculty and created the Center for the 
Study of Race, Indigeneity and Transnational Migration 
(RITM). Located at 35 Broadway, the center supports 
The Asian-American Task Force meets to 
discuss how to increase awareness, enrollment 
and offerings of Asian-American studies courses at 


the field of Ethnic Studies at Yale and became the home for 
the study of Asian American migration and diaspora. As the 
RITM and the ER&M program took over the work of hiring 
and retaining faculty devoted to Asian American Studies, 
the AASTF discontinued. 


Yet despite this ostensible progress, students remained 
dissatisfied. Stefani Kuo, who graudated Yale in 2017, 
had arrived at Yale hoping to double major in English 
and Theater Studies. After two years as an English major, 
however, she had taken Yale’s only class on Asian American 
literature and was frustrated about “just how little” Asian 
American writing she had been exposed to. “There just 
wasn’t a range of Asian American writing or literature 
classes I could take, especially in the English major.” Kuo 
did not have a single professor who was an Asian woman. 
“Even the classes that were of interest to me were not 
taught by people who looked like me,” she said.


Kuo eventually dropped the English major and focused 
solely on theater. Her first play, “Architecture of Rain,” 
included an all Asian American student cast. “The play was 
from a personal perspective. I wasn’t just making something 
up,” Kuo said. In the play, Kuo reflected, she could delve 
into her Asian American identity and experiences that felt 
visceral to her but that she couldn’t articulate in her classes.


In fall 2018, Katherine Hu took Professor Mary Lui’s 
class on Asian American History, which inspired her 
to advocate, as a YCC representative, for more course 
offerings in Asian American Studies. “[The course] made 
me realize that there’s a lot of Asian American history that’s 
been erased, and so many Asian American students feel like 
they’re not part of the conversation, or they don’t have a 
voice in politics,” Hu said. Hu is pushing for a curriculum 
that emphasizes an intersectional look at issues that span 
across a range of minority groups. For this reason, she thinks 
“that creating a separate program would be antithetical 
to the philosophy of learning.” Hu said that classes don’t 
necessarily need to have “Asian American” in the title to be 
considered part of the Asian American Studies curriculum. 
In high school, Hu didn’t often think about her Asian 
American identity, she told me. She grew up in Texas, in 
a town with a large Asian population, where being “too 
Asian” was seen as a negative characteristic. At Yale—
where 19.3 percent of the undergraduates identify as Asian 
American—she at first wanted to break away from an “Asian 
American bubble,” so she didn’t engage with the AACC. 
When she saw Lui’s “Asian American History” in the Blue 
Book for the fall 2018 semester, she realized a piece of her 
education was missing. Her high school history teachers, 
Hu said, “never talked about Asian American history,” 
except as “a kind of footnote.” She felt that Lui’s class gave 
her an opportunity for the first time to learn about her own 
history and the history of Asian Americans more generally. 
Hu praised large introductory courses like Lui’s, which 
taught her new techniques for thinking about identity and 
intersectionality. 


Through her YCC project, she hopes that students will 
find their own spaces in Asian American studies courses. 
“I’m trying to create a space for people who want to know 
their own history that has been taken from them,” she 
explained. Hu plans to work alongside Professor Gary 
Okihiro to start a student working group that would put 
together and publicize classes that consider Asian American 
identity, Asian diaspora, and Ethnic Studies. Next year, 
professors Lisa Lowe and Daniel HoSang will offer larger 
foundational lecture courses for those who want to learn 
more about Asian American Studies and Ethnic Studies but 
might not know where to begin. 


Mary Lui was the first full-time Asian Americanist 
scholar at Yale when she joined the faculty in 2000. Lui, 
who is one of the thirteen professors who withdrew from 
ER&M, sits with her arms crossed in her office in Timothy 
Dwight College. With passion in her voice, she stops me 
every now and then to clarify what I’ve asked. Before she 
arrived at Yale, only one Asian Americanist had ever worked 
at the University, on a part-time basis. The year 2000, Lui 
said, seemed like a wonderful moment for Asian American 
scholarship at Yale: new Asian American faculty members 
were being hired and more classes in Asian American 
studies were being offered. 


In January, following the YCC town hall last December, 
Lui told me that Asian American studies at Yale had again 
grown significantly after student protests in 2015 that called 
for more curricular diversity. She noticed an increase in 
courses related to Asian American Studies, alongside a 
growing number of tenured Asian American professors. 
These developments, Lui said, made it seem less necessary 
to create a formalized Asian American Studies program. 


In recent months, with ER&M in flux and a growing 
worry that an Asian American Studies program would be 
insular and too narrow in scope, faculty members and 
students have been resistant to the idea of a distinct Asian 
American Studies program. “There’s this tension with 
the desire of institution-building,” Professor Sunny Xiang 
told me. “How do you build spaces that are institutionally 
secure while also critiquing the terms of that? While 
building Asian American studies, ‘more is better’ can’t be 
the horizon of our politics—[it has to be a greater] desire 
for knowledge.” 


Dean Joliana Yee of the Asian American Cultural Center 
echoed Xiang’s sentiments, explaining that students must 
continue to think about the ways in which the Asian 
American experience is intertwined with other marginalized 
experiences. “What’s the point of telling history if we are 
not advancing all marginalized communities?”

Others have expressed qualms with the term ‘Asian American.’ 
Professor Gary Okihiro, who was instrumental in creating Asian 
American Studies at Cornell and UCLA, among other universities, 
told me that “the term Asian American is in a way a misnomer; it 
erases the differences between many groups.” Okihiro is also one of 
the thirteen professors formerly affiliated with ER&M.


Echoing Okihiro, some students voiced that Asian American-
specific course offerings at Yale should expand to cover the 
diversity of Asian American identities. “To have a class on Asian 
American history is to undeniably leave people out,” Sana Aslam 
’20, an Anthropology major who has taken several Hindi courses 
and who enjoys studying South Asian diaspora, told me. “I’d love to 
see more classes on Pakistan-American identity, because that’s my 
background,” she said, adding, “I don’t think Nepal, Sri Lanka and 
Bangladeshi-American histories are really represented at all.” 
Students, she said, need to “understand how Asian American 
history is occurring in direct relationship to other histories, 
Women’s and Gender Studies, African American history—so we 
see that it doesn’t come out of nowhere, it comes out of histories 
of exclusion.” 

In response to the YCC’s efforts last fall to institutionalize Asian 
American Studies, students revived the AASTF and have since 
pushed for an intersectional approach to the program. Early this 
“‘There’s this tension 
with the desire of 
institution-building,’

told me. ‘How do you

semester, members of the task force gathered together 
at the Asian American Cultural Center, where eleven 
students, including Rita Wang and Janis Jin, leaders of 
the task force, sat on the carpet and shared their hopes. 
First-years sat on the couches and on the floor and shared 
their initial experiences at Yale, their apprehensions about 
taking Asian American History as they hungered to learn 
more about their family history but did not know where to 
begin. “What do you want to see this group become?” Jin 
asked, and students responded that they wanted to be part 
of a reading group, where they could read Asian American 
literature and discuss the nuances of their identity that they 
did not feel comfortable sharing with their peers. The room 
felt open, a space where students, who ranged from first-
years to seniors, could share their thoughts and hopes. In 
thinking about how to publicize classes in Asian American 
Studies at Yale, a student suggested that CourseTable, a 
popular student-run website that organizes course offerings 
at Yale, could have a listing of those courses. There was also 
talk of creating a survey course in Asian American studies, 
and starting a weekly reading group, where students could 
discuss pop culture references and academic articles about 
Asian American experiences. 

Everyone involved in the AASTF has also been involved 
in the Coalition for Ethnic Studies, of which Jin has also 
been a leader. Asian American studies, she reiterated, does 
not siphon from ethnic studies but exists within it. Jin values 
the comparative framework that Ethnic Studies affords, as 
opposed to an Asian American Studies program focusing 


For Jin, the importance of Ethnic Studies has been on 
her mind since she was in high school. “I basically came 
to Yale for ER&M when I was a senior in high school,” 
Jin remembered. Jin went to a private high school in the 
“most conservative county in California,” in an area that 
was very homogeneous, as she described it, and mostly 
white and Asian. She said she felt as though she had to 
fight constantly with people about race and politics until 
she discovered Lisa Lowe’s book, Immigrant Acts. Jin wrote 
about the book in her college application essay. Now, she is 
taking a course taught by Lowe, who is one of the professors 
at Yale who recently withdrew from ER&M. Jin said she has 
learned from Professors Lowe and HoSang about the need 
for comparative, relational Ethnic Studies that does not 
focus just on one group, history, or set of struggles, but on 
how they interact. “It blew my mind,” Jin said, describing 
the effect Lowe’s book had on her when she was in high 
school. “Ethnic Studies scholarship became a way to name 
things I was experiencing—it was a body of knowledge that 
could articulate various things about how I saw the world.” 

“I want to offer a different kind of Asian American 
studies,” said Professor Sunny Xiang as we spoke in her 
office. “I want [my] course to be outward-facing, in that 
[students are] taking Asian American literature as a way of 
engaging with race relations, U.S.-Asia relations.”


Earlier that day, I had witnessed this philosophy in action. 
During the hour and fifteen minute-long class period of 
“Asian American Literature” on Wednesday afternoon in 
Linsly-Chittenden Hall, fourteen students of mostly Asian 
American background sat around a small circular table 
and discussed Maxine Hong Kingston’s Woman Warrior, a 
novel centered around Chinese-American girlhood. “The 
novel starts out,” Professor Xiang said quietly but steadily, 
“with the quote: You must not tell anyone.” Her voice was 
not domineering. Her thickly-rimmed glasses rested on the 
bridge of her nose, and her voice and eyes exuded warmth. 
She positioned herself as one of the students around the 
seminar table, not as someone with the most important 
voice in the classroom. She told her students to call her 
Sunny, rather than Professor Xiang. 

“My goal for today is to have everyone say something,” 
she said to the class. “It doesn’t have to be to me, it could 
be to a friend.”


When the class gathered back together, Professor Xiang 
had a student read aloud the quote, “She will add nothing 
if not for necessity, the riverbend of her life.” Minh Vu, 
Professor Mary Lui teaches a class on Asian 
American History and Historiography.
an English major, raised his hand and offered that silence 
in the novel is necessary. From the silence, he expanded, 
we could learn more about the character’s family history 
and her relationship to her mother. Xiang wrote the 
words “necessity and extravagance” on the board in chalk. 
Fragments of Greek were harshly written on the other side 
of the board. 

Later that afternoon in her office in William L. Harkness 
Hall, Professor Xiang said, “We’re reading a book about 
silence, so we want to respect silence in the classroom.” 
When students are not immediately speaking, said Xiang, 
that does not mean they are not involved. 

I meet with Vu that Friday at Blue State on Wall Street. 
At first we stand at the table by the door of Blue State, 
unable to find a seat. It’s a Friday morning, and the rain 
has not stopped. Vu is unassuming and cheerful, offering 
a laugh every now and then, circling with his finger the 
buttons on his shirt. When one of the tables clears, Vu and 
I sit down. Vu reflects on how different the Asian American 
Literature seminar is from his Directed Studies courses 
or other English seminars. “This class is majority people 
of color,” he says. “It’s a community of scholars of color.” 
The experience of feeling different in a classroom where 
the majority of students do not share your background, 
Vu expresses, can be isolating and delegitimizing. Ethnic 
Studies seminars offer a way out of this isolation for 
some students, in texts that corroborate and reflect their 
experiences. 

In the next few years, Vu wants to attend a graduate 
program in Asian American Studies and become a professor 
in Asian American Studies or Ethnicity and Migration 
Studies. His experience as an English major at Yale, in 
which he initially took courses that did not address the 
Asian American experience, made him more curious about 
Asian American literature. His first year, Vu was part of the 
Directed Studies humanities program. “I think the Yale 
English department has a tendency to focus on a formalist 
method, like close reading,” he said. “Sometimes close 
reading pushes you in.” In contrast, during his sophomore 
year, he took Asian American History with Professor Lui. 
The class, he said, was pivotal for him because it drew 
in aspects of his personal life with historiography, with 
assignments like an oral history project. 

Growing up, Vu often felt as though he couldn’t identify 
with the protagonists in the literature he read, which 
centered predominantly on white characters. In Vu’s family, 
he said, “there was not much honesty or open dialogue 
about our history as refugees, and I had a lack of access to 
my history.” Vu attended a largely white public high school 
with mostly white teachers and peers, which compounded 
into an experience of exclusion for Vu that extended 
into his Directed Studies seminars in his first year. This 
semester, in Xiang’s class, Vu read The Gangster We Are All 
– Meghana Mysore is a 
junior in Davenport College.
“Ethnic studies 
scholarship became a 
way to name things I 
was experiencing — it 
was a body of knowledge 
that could articulate 
various things about 
how I saw the world.” 
Looking For by Le Thi Diem Thuy, a Vietnamese-American 
author. Vu, whose parents are refugees from the Vietnam 
War, was drawn to this text because Thuy explains the 
refugee experience through the personal lens of a singular 
family, rather than in dry and abstract academic terms. 
Literature taught in Ethnic Studies seminars has helped 
him to articulate how systems of racial hierarchy operate in 
everyday life, which academic language often struggles to 
capture. “I’m interested in the everyday practice of power, 
and how power is enacted upon minoritized bodies,” he 
said. 

At Blue State, Vu finishes his coffee. Before we leave, he 
turns to me and tells me again that in Xiang’s class, he really 
feels listened to. He thinks this is a common experience 
among his peers in the class, due to Xiang’s warm presence 
and the discussions about literature that expresses Asian 
American experiences. 

“I think it’s really important to be heard,” he says, “and 
that’s how I feel in that class.”

T
he aldermanic chambers were so packed that 
people had to sit on the floor, stand in the aisles, 
or even crane their necks from the hallway 
outside, where the crowd had overflowed. It was loud. It 
was hot. And the people inside the chambers were angry. 
Activists from New Haven Rising – an organization that 
campaigns alongside unions for solutions to the jobs crisis 
– waved signs reading “HIRE US” and “Yale: Take the 
Lead!” Yalies fanned themselves with fliers. Concerned 
New Haven residents read the sheets Yale representatives 
had handed out, cataloguing the university’s record of 
local hiring in the past three years. Other New Haveners, 
who had tried and failed to find work at Yale, prepared to 
give short testimonials. It was February 21st, 2019. Yale 
was making a public report on its progress toward a 2015 
pledge to increase the number of workers it hires from 
New Haven.

In that pledge — which Yale officials publicly signed 
in December 2015 — the University promised to hire one 
thousand New Haven residents into permanent full-time 
jobs. At least five hundred of these residents had to come 
from “neighborhoods of need,” a term used in the pledge to 
refer to communities in New Haven where the jobs crisis is 
particularly severe, including Dixwell, Dwight, Fair Haven, 
The Hill, Newhallville, West River, and West Rock. At the 
February hearing, Janet Lindner, Yale’s Vice President for 
Human Resources and Administration, initially claimed 
that Yale had far surpassed these figures, hiring 2,591 New 
Haven residents, including 627 from neighborhoods of 
need. But both city alders and representatives from Yale’s 
Local 34 and Local 35 unions immediately questioned 
those numbers. Lindner had counted 1,431 post-doctoral 
associates – temporary graduate researchers, not permanent 
hires, as stipulated by the original contract. Board of Alders 
President Tyisha Walker-Myers also questioned whether 
journeymen construction workers should be counted, 
since they were being hired for short-term contracts and 
already had credentials. Discounting the journeymen, Yale 
had hired only 876 of the promised one thousand New 
Haven residents. Only 273 of the promised five hundred 
came from neighborhoods of need.

Over the course of the four and a half hour hearing, 
forty-five speakers gave three-minute speeches, several of 
which were recounted by the New Haven Independent. 
Since graduating from Wilbur Cross High School three 
years ago, Carlos Hernandez said he had applied multiple 
times for a service job at Yale. Despite his experience in 
kitchens and hospitals, Yale rejected all his applications. 
Jamie Schmidt tried for eight years to get a full-time job 
at Yale. Although she held a business degree, she was 
told that she wasn’t qualified. And Karen Harrison, a 
grandmother living in West Rock, said she had been trying 
for six months to get a full-time job at the dining hall she 
works in, ever since her hours there were cut. 
“Today I am one of those that’s struggling,” Harrison 
said at the hearing, as the Independent reported. “I’m one 
of the ones that’s going to have my lights turned out. I’m 
one of the ones that isn’t going to have food. I’m one of the 
ones that might not hawve heat or a roof over my head. I 
just wanted to be one of those who get good-paying jobs 
that they promised us.”

Some of the youth activists present discussed the 
connection between violent crime and unemployment. 
They argued that more local jobs would save the lives 
of youths killed on the streets. (While violent crime in 
New Haven has been steadily decreasing over the past 
decade, there were still ten homicides in 2018.) Others 
noted that many of the neighborhoods of need have high 
Black and Hispanic populations; Yale’s failure to hire from 
these communities, they claimed, made it complicit in 
racial injustice. And Rev. Scott Marks – Director of New 
Haven Rising – said that “this failure has revealed that 
the University’s hiring process is deeply flawed, and New 
Haven residents are not being treated fairly. Our residents 
can succeed in Yale jobs, but the current hiring process 
erects walls that prevent them from having a fair shot.” 
Since the 1970s, when factories began to close en 
masse, New Haven has experienced economic decline and 
high unemployment levels. If all New Haven jobs went to 
New Haven residents, then the jobs crisis might be over. 
According to Free Speech Radio News (FSRN), in 2015 
there were eighty-three thousand jobs in New Haven, 
more than half of which paid a living wage of at least 
twenty dollars an hour. “But only nine thousand of those 
living wage jobs are held by New Haven residents,” FSRN 
reported, “and only two thousand of them by residents 
in the city’s low-income neighborhoods.” Though Yale is 
the city’s largest employer by a significant margin, FSRN 
reported that in 2015, less than a third of its employees 
lived in New Haven.

Throughout the February hearing, several questions were 
reiterated, again and again. Is Yale genuinely committed to 
local hiring? Is it committed to hiring workers from low-
income neighborhoods – to ending the jobs crisis that has 
existed in these communities since the 1970s? 


When Joelle Fishman moved to New Haven in 1968, 
the Elm City was a factory town with Yale at the center. 
She remembers that New Haven was seething with activity 
back then — an activist’s city, filled with Vietnam War 
protesters, soon to be caught up in the trials of several 
prominent Black Panthers, but also a worker’s city, filled 
with industries and good union jobs. Over the coming 
years, the industries left, the factories closed down, and 
the newly unemployed workers looked to Yale for work. 
Fishman’s husband took a job at Yale. She joined the New 
Haven People’s Center, a local hub for immigrant rights, 
labor activism, and other social justice causes.

The People’s Center has been in New Haven since 1937. 
It’s a weather-worn brick townhouse rising three stories 
over Howe Street; over the years, it’s served as a homeless 
daycare center, a site on the Connecticut Freedom Trail, 
and a meeting place for Union 1199, which represents 
workers in the healthcare industry. The door is usually 
unlocked. The first floor is filled with relics of activism: 
pictures of quilts from the Connecticut Freedom Trail, 
a photograph of some of the youth activists in Elm City 
Dream, and a patchwork quilt decorated with scenes and 
quotes from the civil rights movement. “We are not afraid, 
we are not afraid / We are not afraid today,” reads one of 
the quotes, referencing Pete Seeger. “Oh, deep in my heart 
I do believe / We shall overcome some day.”

Fishman is older now: wrinkled, a little hunched, but 
just as active in community organizing today as she was 
in 1968. She’s become the coordinator of the New Haven 
People’s Center. When she talks about the jobs crisis in New 
Haven, about the longstanding pattern of discrimination in 
Yale’s local hiring, it’s with a clear and steady voice. “A lot 
of work, a lot of commitment, a lot of determination” — 
that’s what brought Yale to the negotiating table in 2015, 
Fishman believes, and that’s what will bring it back in the 
future. “It was basically taking anger and frustration in the 
community and turning it in a positive direction. Saying, 
‘let’s do this together.’”

There are several reasons why Fishman believes that 
Yale has a duty to hire from neighborhoods of need. One 
is that the city’s economic decline has disproportionately 
affected communities with high populations of racial 
minorities. In 1937, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation 
(HOLC) created a “residential safety map” of New Haven, 
indicating which areas in the city were “safe” to invest 
in and which areas were supposedly too hazardous for 
investment. HOLC’s map also noted which neighborhoods 
had been “infiltrated” by racial minorities; none of the 
safe neighborhoods had any infiltration, while many of 
the hazardous neighborhoods included descriptions such 
as “given over largely to Negros employed as domestics.” 
(Infiltration was used by HOLC as an official term.) This 
map – a form of redlining – prevented many residents 
of the hazardous neighborhoods from obtaining home 
loans or other basic services. It also accentuated racial 
segregation in the city. 

When industries left, the redlined communities 
(those that HOLC had marked as hazardous) suffered 
inordinately. In 2011, the Connecticut Center for a New 
Economy (CCNE) published a comprehensive report 
detailing the history of economic inequality in New Haven 
over the past few decades. Among other things, this report 
compared the economic evolution of Newhallville, a 
redlined community that relied heavily on jobs from the 
gun company Winchester Repeating Arms, and that of 
East Rock, one of New Haven’s wealthier neighborhoods. 
In 2011, fewer than 6 percent of households earned less 
than $10,000 in East Rock; 20 percent did in Newhallville. 
27 percent of households earned more than $100,000 per 
year in East Rock; 6 percent did in Newhallville. East Rock 
is over 80 percent white. Newhallville is more than 80 
percent African-American. 

Yale didn’t help HOLC draw its map of New Haven, 
and Fishman doesn’t claim that the university is directly 
responsible for racial segregation in the city. But she does 
think that the university is complicit in New Haven’s racial 
inequality, in part because it has historically hired few 
residents of redlined communities. She thinks that Yale’s 
commitment to hire from neighborhoods of need is a 
necessary redress for past discrimination: for past attempts 
to shut out the “hazardous” portions of New Haven.


When Fishman came to New Haven in 1968, Yale 
President Kingman Brewster was advocating a plan that 
would physically separate the University from Dixwell, 
Newhallville, and other redlined neighborhoods by 
extending interstates I-91 and I-95 around the campus 
in a circle. “There was a lot of opposition,” Fishman 
recalls. “It was called a moat. It was stopped by community 
organizing.” She remembers a day, not long after this 
plan was defeated, when her husband brought home a 
memo from Yale warning new students about “dangerous 
people” they might encounter on the streets. “It was 
coded language,” Fishman says. “It was racist.” And she 
remembers yet another day, years later, when a highly 
qualified African-American woman was denied a job at 
Yale in favor of an outside candidate. A local union filed 
a grievance; the professor in charge of hiring — who also 
lived outside New Haven, near the outside candidate — 
explained his rationale with surprising candor during the 
grievance hearing. “It’s true that the two women are equally 
qualified,” Fishman remembers him saying. “But because 
I’m more comfortable with the woman from my area, that 
makes her more qualified than the other woman.”

Near the end of the CCNE report, the authors claim 
that what New Haven needs above all is a jobs pipeline: 
“a large-scale, comprehensive program…to educate, 
train, and hire local residents.” Shortly after the report 
was published, rallies and protests began in earnest. In 
December 2011, one thousand people marched in a rally 
against income inequality, carrying “Occupy New Haven” 
posters above them. In April 2012, nearly two thousand 
people marched from the New Haven Green to Yale

by CCNE. 

In September 2014, organizers from New Haven 
Rising inaugurated a campaign for more local jobs in 
New Haven. In June 2015, after many months of protests 
and community organizing, Yale pledged to hire five 
hundred New Haven residents over the next two years. 
This proposal — which made no mention of New Haven’s 
low-income neighborhoods — was greeted with almost 
universal condemnation. Only two days later, a crowd of 
one thousand demonstrators gathered on the New Haven 
Green. “Hire the five hundred now!” Ward 23 Alder 
Tyisha Walker-Myer shouted before the crowd. Posters 
with this slogan were all over the Green. Mayor Toni Harp 
and Rev. Scott Marks said that Yale had a responsibility to 
help fix the jobs crisis. Several months later, in December, 
New Haven Rising planned another demonstration — this 
time a march on the Broadway shopping district, which 
could have resulted in mass arrests. Just days before the 
march was scheduled to take place, Yale conceded to 
the organizers’ demands. The university made its public 
pledge to hire one thousand city residents and committed 
to hiring five hundred from neighborhoods of need. 
A month after the report was published, the Board of 
Alders created a research group charged with finding 
solutions to the jobs crisis. This group conceived New 
Haven Works (NHW) – a nonprofit that helps residents 
apply to jobs at Yale and other local other employers. The 
job coaches at NHW work in collaboration with staff from 
Yale’s New Haven Community Hiring Initiative, a program 
that matches NHW’s clients with available job openings at 
Yale. The 2015 pledge stipulated that Yale’s one thousand 
local hires “would come primarily from New Haven 
Works.” Yet it would be hard to call NHW a “large-scale” 
or “comprehensive” solution to the jobs crisis. According 
to Filip Relic – a recently hired job coach at NHW – the 
nonprofit has only five job coaches, and in a typical month 
it has room to take in under half of the hundred or so 
people who pre-register for job counseling. These forty to 
fifty applicants are chosen by random lottery. The rest are 
out of luck.


New Haven Works has its office on the first floor of a 
tired-looking brick building near the Peabody Museum. 
Walk inside on a typical day, and you’ll find a row of 
empty seats and blank computers, a listless room with 
motivational posters plastered to every available surface. 
There’s a receptionist, a job coach or two, and a handful 
of young men and women sitting in front of computers, 
revising their resumes, sending in application after 
application. The only sound in the room is the chatter of 
the receptionist and the soft clicking of the keyboards.


For many of its clients, NHW makes all the difference. 
Osikhena Awudu can’t remember how many times he 
applied to positions at Yale before coming to NHW. Back 
in 2012, he was a paralegal at a Hartford law office; he 
wanted to work at Yale because the seventy-five-mile 
round-trip commute from his Newhallville home to 
Hartford was taking a toll on his family life. He applied to 
technical positions, to low-level administrative positions, 
to anything for which he was qualified. All his applications 
were denied. He never even got an interview. 
“New Haven Works broke the cycle, really,” Awudu said. 
“I had sent many, many applications before, but essentially 
hadn’t gotten anywhere.” He was an impressive candidate. 
He had a bachelor’s degree in law from the University 
of Ibadan, a master’s degree from the University of 
Buckingham, and a year’s professional experience working 
as a paralegal. A job coach at NHW helped him strengthen 
his resume and put him in contact with a human resources 
generalist at Yale. A few weeks later, the generalist invited 
Awudu to apply for a position as a senior administrator at 
the Law School, a job that normally would have been open 
only to internal applicants. He went through a series of 
interviews, was hired, and a few years later moved up to 
his current position as a program manager. He’s been at 
Yale ever since.


Melissa Mason, the Executive Director of NHW, is 
proud of the work her staff has done over the past seven 
years. “Since we’ve opened our doors, we’ve placed over 
1,300 people into jobs with area employers, and 75 percent 
of those jobs have been what we call regular or permanent 
jobs,” she said. NHW services clients with a wide range of 
backgrounds: people with high school diplomas, with an 
associate’s or bachelor’s degree, and even some, like Awudu, 
with master’s degrees or PhDs. Mason noted that over 80 
percent of NHW’s clients are people of color and that over 
50 percent come from low-income neighborhoods.


Relic became a job coach at NHW quite recently, but 
he’s already been able to help several people find work. 
One of his clients works in New York City and spends five 
hours on the train every day, which costs her about $800 
per month. She hadn’t had any success applying to jobs 
in New Haven for the past three years, but after just three 
meetings with Relic she’s been able to get an interview at a 
local bank. “She may be selected or not,” Relic said, “but 
it’s definitely bringing her closer to the goal.”


Relic noted, however, that NHW doesn’t have the staff 
or the funding to address the full demand of New Haven 
residents for job counseling. The majority of NHW’s 
funding comes from the state and the city of New Haven, 
though Yale also supports the nonprofit. “Considering the 
size of this nonprofit, I think we are doing a great job,” 
Relic said. “Considering the size and the budget,” he 
repeated. 


Local hiring isn’t just an economic issue. Though violent 
crime has decreased markedly in New Haven in recent 
years, it still disproportionately affects the “neighborhoods 
of need” of Yale’s promisecommunities with high minority 
populations, and many believe that better job prospects in 
the area would help keep the area safer. The authors of 
the CCNE report include several testimonies from New 
Haven residents. One of the most striking comes from 
Shelton Tucker, who in the late 1990s turned to drug 
dealing because of the lack of economic opportunity in 
New Haven.

“When I was a kid, drug dealers were looked at as 
somebody who had made it — had found a way to climb 
up out of this mess,” Tucker said in his testimony. He also 
turned to drug dealing; at the age of fifteen, he was making 
$500 a day. “But within three years I had a list of names 
in a folder—it had to be thirty names—of my friends who 
had died,” he wrote. “In 1997, I went to five funerals in 
two months.”


Tucker argued against policing as a way of combating 
drug dealing. “We can’t arrest our way out of a drug 
problem,” he wrote. “If you really want to fix the problem, 
give those guys some jobs. Prison is not a real deterrent. 
Depending on the level of poverty or desperation, they’ll 
weigh the unpleasantness of going to prison against this 
poverty and desperation, and the risk becomes worth it. 
But the job — that’s a real incentive, and a real way out.”


For Tucker, a good-paying job provided an alternative to 
drug dealing. “I got a job in construction through the city’s 
construction workforce program,” he wrote. “There was an 
opening and I got in and never looked back.”


Naomi D’Arbell Bobadilla, currently a sophomore at 
Yale, campaigned door-to-door for New Haven Rising last 
summer. Bobadilla doesn’t know what the leadership of 
New Haven Rising —which did not respond to repeated 
requests for comment — plans to do next. Members of 
New Haven Rising are currently gathering signatures for a 
community petition, and Bobadilla suspects that something 
larger may follow. “Everyone will have the choice to 
believe a multi-billion dollar corporation or a community 
that has gathered testimonies and stood together,” she said. 
Many activists criticize the university for adopting 
a reactionary posture. While Yale has created several 
programs of its own accord dedicated to ending the 
jobs crisis, such as the New Haven Community Hiring 
Initiative, it has also failed to emphasize local hiring at 
moments when activists haven’t pressured it to do so. In 
2017, the Yale Daily News reported that on a typical day, 
just 12 percent of the construction workers building the 
two new residential colleges were New Haven residents. 
Vice President for Communications Eileen O’Connor told 
the News that on most construction projects, the university 
tries to get “at least 25 percent New Haven residents,” 
and that they had merely fallen short on this particular 
project. A city official interviewed by the News mentioned 
the specialized skills needed to build certain parts of the 
colleges – skills that few New Haven residents possessed. 
Fishman saw things differently. She considered the low 
figure to be yet more evidence that Yale isn’t invested in 
hiring from New Haven.


Fishman believes there are systemic issues with Yale’s 
hiring practices that have historically shut out many New 
Haven residents. She said that a little more than a year after 
Yale’s 2015 pledge, members of New Haven’s Black and 
Hispanic Caucus met with representatives of Yale to review 
the university’s progress. During the meeting, Fishman 
said, “they discovered that the majority of applications 
that came from New Haven Works weren’t even opened. 
If there was one small error, or if one line wasn’t filled out 
on the cover, then the whole thing was just put in the file 
bin.” She also mentioned that for certain jobs at Yale, you 
have to start out as a casual worker with twenty or fewer 
hours every week. “It’s really hard for people to do that, 
because they can’t live on that,” she said. “You have to 
have another job as well.” Since the hearing this February, 
Yale has avoided commenting on its 2015 pledge. Lindner, 
Tom Conroy, the University Spokesman, and Chris Brown, 
the Director of Yale’s New Haven Community Hiring 
Initiative, were all unwilling to provide any comment on 
Yale’s hiring processes. Representatives of Yale’s UNITE 
HERE unions also did not respond to repeated requests 
for comment.


Alderman Hacibey Catalbasoglu, currently a senior 
at Yale, remembers the February hearing as if it were 
yesterday. He had never seen so many people in the 
aldermanic chambers. Hacibey has lived in New Haven 
all his life, but he also remembers that, before becoming a 
Yalie, he never felt comfortable walking onto Cross Campus. 
For him, the jobs campaign is part of the larger struggle to 
eliminate the divide between Yale and New Haven. “We 
shouldn’t be making Yale out as the enemy,” he said. “But, 
at the same time, we should be asking how it can do more.” 
Last year, in a bid to balance New Haven’s budget, the 
Board of Alders approved an 11 percent increase in the city’s 
already high property tax. Yale owns a large proportion of the 
land in New Haven, but much of its property is tax-exempt. 
Catalbasoglu thinks that the residential colleges, at the very 
least, should not be tax-exempt. He thinks that Yale should 
try to get an affordable diner to open on Broadway in order to 
turn the Broadway triangle into a place where Yalies mingle 
with New Haven residents rather than a gentrified extension 
of Yale, “a place where New Haven residents don’t go.” And 
even if Yale had fulfilled its 2015 pledge, he doesn’t think 
that five hundred hires from neighborhoods of need would 
be enough. “No number is enough,” he said.


In 2011, thirty-four people were killed on the streets of 
New Haven. When Fishman thinks back to that violent 
year, she wonders whether those people would have died if 
the jobs crisis had been less severe.  She wonders if Yale 
could have done more for New Haven in 2011, if it will do 
more in the future. “There’s a lot of anger. There’s a lot of 
frustration,” she said. “Yale is the company in a company 
town right now.”

Yale paid only $4.9 million in taxes 
in 2018, but New Haven claims the 
University should be paying twenty-
six times that amount. In 1834, the state of 
Connecticut amended the Yale charter to 
exempt the University from local taxes on 
any property that makes less than $6,000 in 
income each year. (As a nonproﬁt, Yale also 
does not pay any federal taxes.) Over the last 
two centuries, New Haven has made multiple 
attempts to tax Yale’s property, but all have 
failed. Most recently, in 2016, Mayor Toni Harp 
and several alders voiced support for a piece 
of state legislation that would revise the Yale 
charter and enable a new property tax on Yale. 
Although the bill was not passed, it ignited the 
“Tax Yale” movement, a community campaign 
for a tax on Yale’s academic buildings. But 
Yale’s spokespeople have pushed back against 
new taxes, stating that Yale is one of the largest 
taxpayers in the city due to the taxes it pays 
on non-academic properties, like the Yale 
Bookstore and the Yale-New Haven Hospital. In 
addition, the University makes annual voluntary 
contributions of millions of dollars directly to 
City Hall. In 2018, it contributed just over 
$11.5 million to the city, according to the Ofﬁce 
of New Haven and State Affairs.

In 1899, Yale sued New Haven after the 
city produced legislation that would have 
established a property tax on Yale’s room and 
board facilities. The University won the suit. 
Fifty-one years later, in Yale v. New Haven, the 
city of New Haven sued Yale for neglecting to 
pay taxes on sixteen buildings. In 1975, in Yale 
University v. City of New Haven, the city sued 
Yale again, this time for not paying taxes on 
the Yale University Press building at 149 York 
Street. All three times, the courts found that the 
stipulations in the 1834 charter still stood. Yale 
won all three cases, retaining the right to own 
tax-exempt property.

“[Yale] is the single largest local economic 
force in New Haven—larger than fellow 
nonproﬁts or any private corporation,” Yale 
spokesperson Tom Conroy told the New Haven 
Independent in March 2016. The amount that 
Yale pays voluntarily is proportionate to its 
on-campus population, and as Yale’s population 
has grown, so has the amount of voluntary 
payments.

Proponents of a new property tax on Yale 
point to the economic disparities between the 
city of New Haven and the University’s campus 
as evidence that New Haven’s deﬁciency in tax 
revenue hinders the city’s economic growth. 
In May 2018, Mayor Harp released a monthly 
ﬁnancial report, showing that New Haven’s 
deﬁcit was about $15 million for the 2017-2018 
school year. “The noticeable difference in the 
percentage of the general fund increase and the 
[property tax rate] increase is largely a function 
of sharply decreased anticipated revenue next 
year,” Mayor Harp said to the New Haven 
Independent in March 2018. “The city stands 
to come nearly $17 million short.”
 Due to this deficit, in May 2018, the Board 
of Alders approved a citywide property tax 
increase of 11 percent. Many felt this tax hike 
was a blow to city residents, especially those 
who had already been struggling to make ends 
meet. “This big increase is going to make a

big dent in my budget,” Fair Haven resident 
Barbara Melotto told NBC Connecticut that 
May. “I’m a retired person living on a fixed 
income and I’m sure many people in New 
Haven feel the same way.”


I wanted to investigate what a new property 
tax on Yale would mean for both the University 
and the city—and whether Yale’s current 
economic contributions to New Haven are 
really enough. To show what it might look like 
if Yale property was taxed, I have chosen to 
focus on two buildings: Grace Hopper College 
and Yale School of Art. I chose these buildings 
to show what it would look like if a residential 
college and an academic building were to 
be taxed, and these properties were perfect 
models. Since the New Haven tax assessment 
database is online and publicly accessible, 
I was able to find the assessed value of each 
building.

In 2018, Yale paid $4.9 million in city taxes. By 
comparison, Dartmouth College, in Hanover, 
New Hampshire, paid $7.3 million in taxes 
in 2017, according to the town of Hanover’s 
annual fiscal report. Unlike Yale, Dartmouth 
has to pay city taxes on its dormitories and 
dining halls. A 1977 New Hampshire Supreme 
Court ruling named Concord v. St. Paul’s 
School required all private schools—including 
colleges and universities—to pay taxes on dorm 
rooms, dining halls, and kitchens. Before this 
case’s ruling, much of Dartmouth’s property 
was tax-exempt.


Before the Board of Alders approved the 
citywide tax hike, Mayor Harp had considered 
Yale as a potential source of tax revenue to 
avoid major cuts in government services. She 
requested that Yale and its nonprofit partners, 
like the Yale-New Haven Hospital, pay $3 
million a year to New Haven in addition to the 
voluntary yearly payment Yale already makes 
to the city. Mayor Harp is still considering this 
as a viable option.

Yale voluntarily pays over $11.5 million a 
year to New Haven; the University would pay 
significantly more if the city taxed its currently 
tax-exempt property. In 2014, Yale avoided taxes 
on about $2.5 billion of property; by comparison, 
two years later, its taxable real estate valued at 
only $116 million.
