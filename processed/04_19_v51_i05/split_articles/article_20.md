A map of Yale’s taxable and tax-exempt properties.


This map displays most of Yale’s 
properties, both academic 
and retail. The red shows 
which properties Yale currently 
pays taxes on, and the black 
shows tax-exempt properties. 
New Haven’s two private colleges, 
Yale University and 
Albertus Magnus College, are 
exempt from paying taxes on most 
of their property.
More than half of all real estate in 
New Haven is tax-exempt.

Yale paid only $4.9 million in taxes 
in 2018, but New Haven claims the 
University should be paying twenty-
six times that amount. In 1834, the state of 
Connecticut amended the Yale charter to 
exempt the University from local taxes on 
any property that makes less than $6,000 in 
income each year. (As a nonproﬁt, Yale also 
does not pay any federal taxes.) Over the last 
two centuries, New Haven has made multiple 
attempts to tax Yale’s property, but all have 
failed. Most recently, in 2016, Mayor Toni Harp 
and several alders voiced support for a piece 
of state legislation that would revise the Yale 
charter and enable a new property tax on Yale. 
Although the bill was not passed, it ignited the 
“Tax Yale” movement, a community campaign 
for a tax on Yale’s academic buildings. But 
Yale’s spokespeople have pushed back against 
new taxes, stating that Yale is one of the largest 
taxpayers in the city due to the taxes it pays 
on non-academic properties, like the Yale 
Bookstore and the Yale-New Haven Hospital. In 
addition, the University makes annual voluntary 
contributions of millions of dollars directly to 
City Hall. In 2018, it contributed just over 
$11.5 million to the city, according to the Ofﬁce 
of New Haven and State Affairs.

In 1899, Yale sued New Haven after the 
city produced legislation that would have 
established a property tax on Yale’s room and 
board facilities. The University won the suit. 
Fifty-one years later, in Yale v. New Haven, the 
city of New Haven sued Yale for neglecting to 
pay taxes on sixteen buildings. In 1975, in Yale 
University v. City of New Haven, the city sued 
Yale again, this time for not paying taxes on 
the Yale University Press building at 149 York 
Street. All three times, the courts found that the 
stipulations in the 1834 charter still stood. Yale 
won all three cases, retaining the right to own 
tax-exempt property.

“[Yale] is the single largest local economic 
force in New Haven—larger than fellow 
nonproﬁts or any private corporation,” Yale 
spokesperson Tom Conroy told the New Haven 
Independent in March 2016. The amount that 
Yale pays voluntarily is proportionate to its 
on-campus population, and as Yale’s population 
has grown, so has the amount of voluntary 
payments.

Proponents of a new property tax on Yale 
point to the economic disparities between the 
city of New Haven and the University’s campus 
as evidence that New Haven’s deﬁciency in tax 
revenue hinders the city’s economic growth. 
In May 2018, Mayor Harp released a monthly 
ﬁnancial report, showing that New Haven’s 
deﬁcit was about $15 million for the 2017-2018 
school year. “The noticeable difference in the 
percentage of the general fund increase and the 
[property tax rate] increase is largely a function 
of sharply decreased anticipated revenue next 
year,” Mayor Harp said to the New Haven 
Independent in March 2018. “The city stands 
to come nearly $17 million short.”
 Due to this deficit, in May 2018, the Board 
of Alders approved a citywide property tax 
increase of 11 percent. Many felt this tax hike 
was a blow to city residents, especially those 
who had already been struggling to make ends 
meet. “This big increase is going to make a
