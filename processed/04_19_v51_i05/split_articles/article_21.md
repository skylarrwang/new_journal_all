big dent in my budget,” Fair Haven resident 
Barbara Melotto told NBC Connecticut that 
May. “I’m a retired person living on a fixed 
income and I’m sure many people in New 
Haven feel the same way.”


I wanted to investigate what a new property 
tax on Yale would mean for both the University 
and the city—and whether Yale’s current 
economic contributions to New Haven are 
really enough. To show what it might look like 
if Yale property was taxed, I have chosen to 
focus on two buildings: Grace Hopper College 
and Yale School of Art. I chose these buildings 
to show what it would look like if a residential 
college and an academic building were to 
be taxed, and these properties were perfect 
models. Since the New Haven tax assessment 
database is online and publicly accessible, 
I was able to find the assessed value of each 
building.

In 2018, Yale paid $4.9 million in city taxes. By 
comparison, Dartmouth College, in Hanover, 
New Hampshire, paid $7.3 million in taxes 
in 2017, according to the town of Hanover’s 
annual fiscal report. Unlike Yale, Dartmouth 
has to pay city taxes on its dormitories and 
dining halls. A 1977 New Hampshire Supreme 
Court ruling named Concord v. St. Paul’s 
School required all private schools—including 
colleges and universities—to pay taxes on dorm 
rooms, dining halls, and kitchens. Before this 
case’s ruling, much of Dartmouth’s property 
was tax-exempt.


Before the Board of Alders approved the 
citywide tax hike, Mayor Harp had considered 
Yale as a potential source of tax revenue to 
avoid major cuts in government services. She 
requested that Yale and its nonprofit partners, 
like the Yale-New Haven Hospital, pay $3 
million a year to New Haven in addition to the 
voluntary yearly payment Yale already makes 
to the city. Mayor Harp is still considering this 
as a viable option.

Yale voluntarily pays over $11.5 million a 
year to New Haven; the University would pay 
significantly more if the city taxed its currently 
tax-exempt property. In 2014, Yale avoided taxes 
on about $2.5 billion of property; by comparison, 
two years later, its taxable real estate valued at 
only $116 million.
