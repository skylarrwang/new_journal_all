asey Gerald’s memoir gets its title 
from a story Gerald found on Tumblr 
about a village in France blessed 
with miracles. In the village, the peasants stop 
working, hoping that the miracles will replace 
their labor in providing food and clothes 
for everyone. The aristocrats, fearing this 
insurgency, erect a sign that declares: “There 
will be no miracles here by order of the king.” 
Gerald tells his own story in his 2018 memoir 
There Will Be No Miracles Here, in which he 
characterizes himself as a peasant boy from 
Dallas, Texas. There Will Be No Miracles Here 
examines the cost of prosperity and provides a 
scathing critique of elitist institutions like Yale, 
the aristocracy in Gerald’s own story.


Gerald wore ripped black skinny jeans to his 
Morse College Tea on April 12, hosted in a small 
reception room with plush red carpets and floor-
to-ceiling windows. He wore a black turtleneck 
and a faded denim jacket that was a size too big 
on purpose. His red and white Nike sneakers 
were the focal point of his look—one that fit 
in with the dozens of students chatting quietly 
and passing around copies of his memoir, which 
was published in 2018. With a lilting Southern 
accent and a wide smile that made you feel like 
you were in on the joke, Gerald introduced 
himself to anyone whose eyes met his. He 
explained that he began writing his book in his 
late twenties in order to find out why he was, 
as he puts it, “all cracked up”—a phrase that 
refers to feelings of fragmentation, unhappiness, 
and loneliness. “You don’t really know what you 
intend when you start [your memoir],” he said. 
“Don’t [write one] unless your life depends on 
it.”


At thirty-two years old, Gerald is an alumnus 
of both Yale College and Harvard Business 
School, an Ivy League football champion, a 
Rhodes Scholar Finalist, a viral TED speaker, 
and now, an author. Gerald grew up in South 
Oak Cliff (SOC), a low-income neighborhood 
in Dallas. In an interview with The New Journal, 
Tony Reno, head coach of the Yale football 
team, recalled walking into South Oak Cliff 
High School fifteen years ago through metal 
detectors. “At the time we recruited from all 
over the country. We knew that [Gerald ] was 
going to be different because of the environment 
he was coming from. It was drastically different 
from Yale,” Coach Reno said. Growing up, 
Gerald was unaware Yale even had a football 
team. Upon receiving a recruitment letter from

IN HIS OWN STORY.”

Yale, he thought to himself, “Ain’t nobody from 
SOC ever gone to no school in  Connecticut—
where is [Connecticut] anyway?” But Gerald 
saw Yale as his chance to leave South Oak Cliff, 
one he could not pass up. 
He writes in his memoir that he accomplished 
everything he was supposed to: made a little 
money, played football, went to a good school, 
and fell in love (at least once). But the “success” 
he learned at Yale had its limitations. “I knew 
how to do an interview, give a speech, kind of 
write a book, but I had no idea about how to 
care for a human being,” he told his audience 
at Morse College. “The search [for success],” he 
writes, “has not yet killed me, though I am a bit 
deranged—and that may be the best that I have 
been in all these years.” In his memoir, Gerald 
recalls his struggles with racial, sexual, and 
political identities at Yale, even among other 
Black students. He remembers the compromises 
he felt he had to make to succeed in a community 
where galas, formals, and networking events are 
the norm. He writes, “The black students at Yale 
were a mighty rich discovery—not only because 
they had so much more or had lived so differently 
than I had, but also and especially because they 
looked at me as though they were itching to 
pose Du Bois’s question: ‘How does it feel to be 
a problem?’” Gerald spent his time at Yale trying 
to distract others from his race, his background, 
and his anger, in order to placate professors, 
advisors, and even classmates. During his first 
year, his academic advisor Penny Laurans, who 
was the chief aide to then President Rick Levin, 
admonished his hat and clothes, exclaiming, 
“Do you wear those things around campus? Oh, 
no, Casey. It’s just so stereotypical, you know? 
You’re at Yale now.” 
There Will Be No Miracles Here is not just 
a manifesto. It’s also a love story. Gerald 
investigates romantic love and heartbreak as a 
queer Black boy with little guidance, familial 
love, and self-love. He remembers falling in 
love with a boy from home during his time at 
Yale. “By love I do not mean the strong dramatic 
feelings that we see on television,” Gerald 
writes. “I found the prospect of needing a human 
being, trusting them, extending myself for them, 
to be more horrifying than being abandoned, or 
almost killed, or damned for all eternity. People 
seemed to be the most dangerous things in this 
world.” Under circumstances in which poverty, 
abandonment, and substance addiction are the 
norm, where self-respect and confidence are 
hard to come by, Gerald says, “the most radical 
thing [one] can do is be well.” 
Gerald writes about founding the Yale Black 
Men’s Union to combat his isolation from his 
own Black identity and to provide a space for 
Black students away from prejudice on campus. 
“Black love is a powerful thing,” he writes. “And 
on this night, love—or whatever the feeling was 
in the room—indeed seemed powerful, powerful 
enough to put genuine smiles on the boys and 
girls, powerful enough to satisfy another mantra 
we adopted in that first year of the Union: We 
measure success by the lives that we change.” 
There Will Be No Miracles Here breaks from the 
conventions of most memoirs. The chronology 
is sometimes ambiguous, and Gerald himself 
inhabits conflicting roles as narrator, protagonist, 
and antagonist. “I didn’t write a book to prove 
that I existed. I’m not on the outside looking in 
or the inside looking out. I am in the middle of 
my consciousness,” he declared in the crowded 
speaking room at Morse College. “Did you ever 
find the parts you lost?” a man in his sixties asked 
from the audience, his hand resting comfortably 
in his wife’s. Gerald paused for a few moments, 
thinking about the question. “Well, they came to 
find me,” he laughed. “I’m still in the recovery 
process, still trying to figure out what it means to 
love someone else.”
