In September 2014, organizers from New Haven 
Rising inaugurated a campaign for more local jobs in 
New Haven. In June 2015, after many months of protests 
and community organizing, Yale pledged to hire five 
hundred New Haven residents over the next two years. 
This proposal — which made no mention of New Haven’s 
low-income neighborhoods — was greeted with almost 
universal condemnation. Only two days later, a crowd of 
one thousand demonstrators gathered on the New Haven 
Green. “Hire the five hundred now!” Ward 23 Alder 
Tyisha Walker-Myer shouted before the crowd. Posters 
with this slogan were all over the Green. Mayor Toni Harp 
and Rev. Scott Marks said that Yale had a responsibility to 
help fix the jobs crisis. Several months later, in December, 
New Haven Rising planned another demonstration — this 
time a march on the Broadway shopping district, which 
could have resulted in mass arrests. Just days before the 
march was scheduled to take place, Yale conceded to 
the organizers’ demands. The university made its public 
pledge to hire one thousand city residents and committed 
to hiring five hundred from neighborhoods of need. 
A month after the report was published, the Board of 
Alders created a research group charged with finding 
solutions to the jobs crisis. This group conceived New 
Haven Works (NHW) – a nonprofit that helps residents 
apply to jobs at Yale and other local other employers. The 
job coaches at NHW work in collaboration with staff from 
Yale’s New Haven Community Hiring Initiative, a program 
that matches NHW’s clients with available job openings at 
Yale. The 2015 pledge stipulated that Yale’s one thousand 
local hires “would come primarily from New Haven 
Works.” Yet it would be hard to call NHW a “large-scale” 
or “comprehensive” solution to the jobs crisis. According 
to Filip Relic – a recently hired job coach at NHW – the 
nonprofit has only five job coaches, and in a typical month 
it has room to take in under half of the hundred or so 
people who pre-register for job counseling. These forty to 
fifty applicants are chosen by random lottery. The rest are 
out of luck.


New Haven Works has its office on the first floor of a 
tired-looking brick building near the Peabody Museum. 
Walk inside on a typical day, and you’ll find a row of 
empty seats and blank computers, a listless room with 
motivational posters plastered to every available surface. 
There’s a receptionist, a job coach or two, and a handful 
of young men and women sitting in front of computers, 
revising their resumes, sending in application after 
application. The only sound in the room is the chatter of 
the receptionist and the soft clicking of the keyboards.


For many of its clients, NHW makes all the difference. 
Osikhena Awudu can’t remember how many times he 
applied to positions at Yale before coming to NHW. Back 
in 2012, he was a paralegal at a Hartford law office; he 
wanted to work at Yale because the seventy-five-mile 
round-trip commute from his Newhallville home to 
Hartford was taking a toll on his family life. He applied to 
technical positions, to low-level administrative positions, 
to anything for which he was qualified. All his applications 
were denied. He never even got an interview. 
“New Haven Works broke the cycle, really,” Awudu said. 
“I had sent many, many applications before, but essentially 
hadn’t gotten anywhere.” He was an impressive candidate. 
He had a bachelor’s degree in law from the University 
of Ibadan, a master’s degree from the University of 
Buckingham, and a year’s professional experience working 
as a paralegal. A job coach at NHW helped him strengthen 
his resume and put him in contact with a human resources 
generalist at Yale. A few weeks later, the generalist invited 
Awudu to apply for a position as a senior administrator at 
the Law School, a job that normally would have been open 
only to internal applicants. He went through a series of 
interviews, was hired, and a few years later moved up to 
his current position as a program manager. He’s been at 
Yale ever since.


Melissa Mason, the Executive Director of NHW, is 
proud of the work her staff has done over the past seven 
years. “Since we’ve opened our doors, we’ve placed over 
1,300 people into jobs with area employers, and 75 percent 
of those jobs have been what we call regular or permanent 
jobs,” she said. NHW services clients with a wide range of 
backgrounds: people with high school diplomas, with an 
associate’s or bachelor’s degree, and even some, like Awudu, 
with master’s degrees or PhDs. Mason noted that over 80 
percent of NHW’s clients are people of color and that over 
50 percent come from low-income neighborhoods.


Relic became a job coach at NHW quite recently, but 
he’s already been able to help several people find work. 
One of his clients works in New York City and spends five 
hours on the train every day, which costs her about $800 
per month. She hadn’t had any success applying to jobs 
in New Haven for the past three years, but after just three 
meetings with Relic she’s been able to get an interview at a 
local bank. “She may be selected or not,” Relic said, “but 
it’s definitely bringing her closer to the goal.”


Relic noted, however, that NHW doesn’t have the staff 
or the funding to address the full demand of New Haven 
residents for job counseling. The majority of NHW’s 
funding comes from the state and the city of New Haven, 
though Yale also supports the nonprofit. “Considering the 
size of this nonprofit, I think we are doing a great job,” 
Relic said. “Considering the size and the budget,” he 
repeated. 


Local hiring isn’t just an economic issue. Though violent 
crime has decreased markedly in New Haven in recent 
years, it still disproportionately affects the “neighborhoods 
of need” of Yale’s promisecommunities with high minority 
populations, and many believe that better job prospects in 
the area would help keep the area safer. The authors of 
the CCNE report include several testimonies from New 
Haven residents. One of the most striking comes from 
Shelton Tucker, who in the late 1990s turned to drug 
dealing because of the lack of economic opportunity in 
New Haven.

“When I was a kid, drug dealers were looked at as 
somebody who had made it — had found a way to climb 
up out of this mess,” Tucker said in his testimony. He also 
turned to drug dealing; at the age of fifteen, he was making 
$500 a day. “But within three years I had a list of names 
in a folder—it had to be thirty names—of my friends who 
had died,” he wrote. “In 1997, I went to five funerals in 
two months.”


Tucker argued against policing as a way of combating 
drug dealing. “We can’t arrest our way out of a drug 
problem,” he wrote. “If you really want to fix the problem, 
give those guys some jobs. Prison is not a real deterrent. 
Depending on the level of poverty or desperation, they’ll 
weigh the unpleasantness of going to prison against this 
poverty and desperation, and the risk becomes worth it. 
But the job — that’s a real incentive, and a real way out.”


For Tucker, a good-paying job provided an alternative to 
drug dealing. “I got a job in construction through the city’s 
construction workforce program,” he wrote. “There was an 
opening and I got in and never looked back.”


Naomi D’Arbell Bobadilla, currently a sophomore at 
Yale, campaigned door-to-door for New Haven Rising last 
summer. Bobadilla doesn’t know what the leadership of 
New Haven Rising —which did not respond to repeated 
requests for comment — plans to do next. Members of 
New Haven Rising are currently gathering signatures for a 
community petition, and Bobadilla suspects that something 
larger may follow. “Everyone will have the choice to 
believe a multi-billion dollar corporation or a community 
that has gathered testimonies and stood together,” she said. 
Many activists criticize the university for adopting 
a reactionary posture. While Yale has created several 
programs of its own accord dedicated to ending the 
jobs crisis, such as the New Haven Community Hiring 
Initiative, it has also failed to emphasize local hiring at 
moments when activists haven’t pressured it to do so. In 
2017, the Yale Daily News reported that on a typical day, 
just 12 percent of the construction workers building the 
two new residential colleges were New Haven residents. 
Vice President for Communications Eileen O’Connor told 
the News that on most construction projects, the university 
tries to get “at least 25 percent New Haven residents,” 
and that they had merely fallen short on this particular 
project. A city official interviewed by the News mentioned 
the specialized skills needed to build certain parts of the 
colleges – skills that few New Haven residents possessed. 
Fishman saw things differently. She considered the low 
figure to be yet more evidence that Yale isn’t invested in 
hiring from New Haven.


Fishman believes there are systemic issues with Yale’s 
hiring practices that have historically shut out many New 
Haven residents. She said that a little more than a year after 
Yale’s 2015 pledge, members of New Haven’s Black and 
Hispanic Caucus met with representatives of Yale to review 
the university’s progress. During the meeting, Fishman 
said, “they discovered that the majority of applications 
that came from New Haven Works weren’t even opened. 
If there was one small error, or if one line wasn’t filled out 
on the cover, then the whole thing was just put in the file 
bin.” She also mentioned that for certain jobs at Yale, you 
have to start out as a casual worker with twenty or fewer 
hours every week. “It’s really hard for people to do that, 
because they can’t live on that,” she said. “You have to 
have another job as well.” Since the hearing this February, 
Yale has avoided commenting on its 2015 pledge. Lindner, 
Tom Conroy, the University Spokesman, and Chris Brown, 
the Director of Yale’s New Haven Community Hiring 
Initiative, were all unwilling to provide any comment on 
Yale’s hiring processes. Representatives of Yale’s UNITE 
HERE unions also did not respond to repeated requests 
for comment.


Alderman Hacibey Catalbasoglu, currently a senior 
at Yale, remembers the February hearing as if it were 
yesterday. He had never seen so many people in the 
aldermanic chambers. Hacibey has lived in New Haven 
all his life, but he also remembers that, before becoming a 
Yalie, he never felt comfortable walking onto Cross Campus. 
For him, the jobs campaign is part of the larger struggle to 
eliminate the divide between Yale and New Haven. “We 
shouldn’t be making Yale out as the enemy,” he said. “But, 
at the same time, we should be asking how it can do more.” 
Last year, in a bid to balance New Haven’s budget, the 
Board of Alders approved an 11 percent increase in the city’s 
already high property tax. Yale owns a large proportion of the 
land in New Haven, but much of its property is tax-exempt. 
Catalbasoglu thinks that the residential colleges, at the very 
least, should not be tax-exempt. He thinks that Yale should 
try to get an affordable diner to open on Broadway in order to 
turn the Broadway triangle into a place where Yalies mingle 
with New Haven residents rather than a gentrified extension 
of Yale, “a place where New Haven residents don’t go.” And 
even if Yale had fulfilled its 2015 pledge, he doesn’t think 
that five hundred hires from neighborhoods of need would 
be enough. “No number is enough,” he said.


In 2011, thirty-four people were killed on the streets of 
New Haven. When Fishman thinks back to that violent 
year, she wonders whether those people would have died if 
the jobs crisis had been less severe.  She wonders if Yale 
could have done more for New Haven in 2011, if it will do 
more in the future. “There’s a lot of anger. There’s a lot of 
frustration,” she said. “Yale is the company in a company 
town right now.”
