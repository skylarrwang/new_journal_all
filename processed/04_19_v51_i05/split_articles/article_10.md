**Title: NEW BOOKS ON THE BLOCK**

The 
pre-recorded 
sound 
of 
a 
harpsichord plucking along to a Baroque 
string ensemble mingles with the smell 
of old pages and wooden bookshelves. Lingering 
near the front door of Grey Matter Books, I watch 
as mid-afternoon light reﬂects off cars lining 
York Street and illuminates piles of secondhand 
books and 1930s Travel magazines that cover the 
surface of the broad windowsill. A middle-aged 
man wearing a green button-down shirt, store 
owner Sam Burton squints at a book through a 
pair of thin glasses pushed to the end of his nose. 
He greets me with an amused smile but glances 
back at the books at his side, explaining that he’s 
in the middle of making a purchase. While I 
wait, I wander over to the arts section and pick 
up a collection of Swedish artist Ulrica Hydman 
Vallien’s paintings: humans rendered in bold 
strokes and bright colors, concealed within a jet-
black jacket cover.

Grey Matter Books opened the doors of its New 
Haven store in late February of this year. You 
might have to squint before you notice the small 
sign in the front window, which features a black-
and-white image of a brain growing from a stem, 
enclosed by a thin circle. 

The bookseller asks if Burton could go any 
higher on his offer for the used books, then 
reluctantly takes one of the crates back into his 
arms. Burton turns to sit down across from me at 
a table buried in more books and faces the sun-
ﬁlled front window, surveying the busy sidewalk 
with distracted glances. 

Though Burton’s own preferences in literature 
ranges from philosophy to ﬁlm, Burton clariﬁes, 
“I don’t think the mission, per se, is to inﬂict my 
taste on people.” The Grey Matter website’s guide 
for booksellers features the store’s “No-go’s” list, 
which states that “the world is choking on its 
copies of The Girl with The Pearl Earring and The 
Da Vinci Code,” among others. On the other hand, 
“The Always and Near-Always Want List” contains 
eight categories including “handsome editions of 
the classics,” “raising chickens; keeping bees,” 
and “basically anything experimental, or else just 
plain good.” These criteria have “been whittled 
down through years of buying and selling,” Burton 
says. He worked at The Strand in New York and 
at independent bookstores across three states 
before opening the ﬁrst Grey Matter in Hadley, 
Massachusetts, ten years ago. “Throwing away 
books is a very important thing,” he tells me. “You 
don’t want the shelves to be stale.”

One round through the store reveals old and 
new, mainstream and niche occupying the same 
shelves. Burton’s eye for the eclectic has curated 
an unusual collection of books that encourages 
customers to jump into unfamiliar literary 
territory. In corporate chain bookstores, autopilot 
steers me straight towards the textbook section, 
or the “kids” section, or, more realistically, the 
in-store Starbucks. I often leave with exactly 
what I came looking for—nothing more, nothing 
less. Instead, Grey Matter beckons me to take 
some time and explore sprawling rows of shelves 
housing unknown genres.

A few days later and a few blocks away, Dave 
Duda, owner of the Book Trader Cafe, sits with me 
in the store’s glass atrium. Downtown New Haven 
was home to ﬁve other independent bookstores 
when he ﬁrst opened his own twenty-three years 
ago, but now, of the ﬁve, only the Book Trader 
Cafe and Atticus Bookstore Cafe remain. “The 
internet basically happened while we’ve been here, 
so we’ve done a lot of evolving,” he comments. 
When book sales alone could not sustain the 
store, Duda expanded food offerings and adjusted 
prices to “mesh with the times.” Nodding to the 
used books sprawled across the main counters, he 
jokes that after the debut of Marie Kondo’s Netﬂix 
show Tidying Up, his inventory is fuller than it’s 
been in a while. Even so, he says that “something
