More than a week ago, over one thousand admitted students arrived on campus for the largest Bulldog Days ever. The 
wide-eyed prefrosh eagerly visited classes, ventured into student club events, and donned their Yale ponchos and drawstring 
backpacks in the rain. They also might have noticed a flurry of protests amid the festivities. Current students organized 
teach-ins and circulated petitions in support of bolstered resources and departmental status for the Ethnicity, Race, and 
Migration program. Activists with Students Unite Now camped outside SSS and blocked traffic in the middle of College 
Street, pushing for financial aid reform. And soon after the prospective students left, Yale and Hamden police officers 
shot at two unarmed Black local residents, Stephanie Washington and Paul Witherspoon. The shooting sparked mass 
demonstrations and raised questions about the University’s role in policing the city beyond its walls. 

We hope this issue, The New Journal’s 260th, inspires you to consider Yale’s place—and property—in New Haven and its 
lingering legacy of racial and socioeconomic exclusion. Inside, read about Yale’s unkept promise to hire more New Haven 
residents; the University’s controversial 185-year-old tax exemptions; the future of Asian American Studies at Yale; the local 
implications of a nationwide college admissions scandal; and more.

As our community reckons with Yale’s neglect for its ER&M program, the University’s broken pledge to hire from New 
Haven, and the shots a campus police officer fired at innocent and unarmed civilians, we head into summer reminded that 
work for a more inclusive future remains. 

Thanks for reading, and please don’t hesitate to drop us a line! 

In friendship,
