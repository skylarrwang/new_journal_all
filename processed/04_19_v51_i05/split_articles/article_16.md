n early December, around sixty students sprawled 
out on the stairs and couches on the first floor of the 
Asian American Cultural Center for a Yale College 
Council (YCC) town hall intended to gauge student 
interest in an Asian American Studies program. On the 
wall in front of the couches hung a painting of Yung 
Wing, class of 1854, the first Chinese student to graduate 
from Yale, or any American university. Katherine Hu, a 
YCC senator, led the project and organized the town 
hall alongside American Studies professors Mary Lui 
and Gary Okihiro. During the gathering, students broke 
into small groups with these professors to express their 
particular interests in Asian American Studies, such as 
South Asian or Vietnamese literature; many were often 
inspired to participate by their family histories. The crowd 
of mostly Asian American students voiced excitement at 
the possibility of exploring South Asian literature or an 
introductory course in Asian American Studies—classes 
not yet offered at Yale. In mid-January, following the 
town hall, the YCC published an infographic, listing six 
new courses this spring under “Asian diaspora/migration 
courses” and “Asian American courses”—and three 
under “Ethnic Studies courses.”


Yet five months have passed since the town hall, and 
the conversation around Asian American Studies has 
radically changed. In early March, students formed 
a Coalition for Ethnic Studies to advocate for the 
University to provide the Ethnicity, Race, and Migration 
(ER&M) program with resources comparable to those of 
other departments. On Friday, March 29, thirteen senior 
faculty members withdrew from the ER&M program in 
protest of the major’s lack of departmental status and 
hiring power, as well as the denial of tenure to ER&M 
and American Studies professor Albert Laguna. ER&M 
now has no tenured professors, and no one with official 
leadership status. Many students have supported the 
thirteen faculty members’ decision, though, denouncing 
the University’s devaluing of their continued labor. 
In support of the ER&M professors, the Coalition for 
Ethnic Studies held a pop-up photo campaign, inviting 
students to Cross Campus to take pictures with brief 
statements describing their defense of ER&M. Over 
the next few days, students showed their solidarity with 
the ER&M faculty, sharing and resharing photos on 
social media. More than a thousand students signed 
a letter that circulated on social media in support of 
ER&M. Despite outpouring of student support for the 
program, President Peter Salovey has not conceded to 
the professors’ requests. 


This advocacy for ER&M is not divorced from 
discussions 
surrounding 
Asian 
American 
Studies 
courses. Many Asian American Studies courses found 
their institutional home in ER&M, and now with the 
program in flux, advocating for Asian American Studies 
has become part of a larger movement to defend and 
support Ethnic Studies at Yale. In many students’ and 
professors’ views,  Asian American Studies should not be 
siphoned off from the broader field of Ethnic Studies, 
given that the strength of ER&M lies in its intersectional 
and interdisciplinary approach. 


In light of the ER&M program’s uncertainty, talk 
of a standalone Asian American Studies program has 
all but died out; the focus has shifted to a broader 
intersectional movement in support of Ethnic Studies. 
As the conversation widens, new questions about the 
best way to institutionalize Asian American Studies have 
emerged: What are the costs and benefits of creating a 
discrete Asian American Studies department? How can 
Ethnic Studies give voice to Asian American Studies 
without subsuming the distinct identities encompassed 
by the term “Asian American”?  


In the spring of 1970, amid a flurry of political activism 
around the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, and 
the Bobby Seale and Black Panthers trial, the first course 
in Asian American Studies was offered at Yale. It was a 
residential college seminar in Timothy Dwight College, 
taught by Professor Chitoshi Yanaga, who was the first 
Japanese American tenured faculty member at Yale. 
The seminar, called “The Asian American Experience,” 
explored questions of Asian American identity formation 
and was the first Asian American-centered course to be 
offered by any Ivy League college. 


The Asian American Students Association (AASA), 
which formed one semester earlier  in the fall of 1969, 
THE  NEW  JOURNAL

“How can Ethnic 
Studies give voice to 
Asian American Studies 
without subsuming 
the distinct identities 
encompassed by the 
term ‘Asian American’?”


worked to develop the course. Don Nakanishi, who 
founded the AASA, recalled that nearly one-third of all 
Asian American undergraduates at Yale enrolled in the 
seminar. In addition to helping create the course, the 
AASA formed an Asian American Studies Task Force 
(AASTF) to advocate for greater diversity in Yale’s 
curriculum. 


“While recognizing that Yale has made efforts to 
expand its course offerings related to East Asia, and 
specifically China and Japan, the AASTF asserts that 
similar attention needs to be given specifically to Asian 
American Studies,” the AASTF website states. Still, while 
the AASTF made efforts to increase course offerings in 
the following decades, faculty with extensive knowledge 
in the field were difficult to retain.  


Forty-five years later, there was a second surge in the 
movement for greater curricular diversity. By the 2014-
15 academic year, only one Asian American Studies 
course was offered at Yale, and only one Asian American 
Studies professor, Mary Lui, had tenure. In October of 
2014, Yale’s four Asian American Studies scholars—Lui, 
newly hired English professor Sunny Xiang, lecturer and 
novelist Susan Choi, and ER&M professor Quan Tran—
held a meet-and-greet that addressed the University’s 
failure to establish an Asian American Studies program 
or even to follow through on a promise it made in 1987 
to offer two courses in Asian American Studies per year. 
This was occurring alongside broader faculty diversity 
concerns—that year, multiple professors in African 
American Studies and ER&M left Yale. As students and 
faculty organized for the departmentalization of ER&M, 
the AASTF started a photo campaign to advocate for 
a wider array of Asian American Studies courses. The 
campaign featured Asian American undergraduate 
students standing on Cross Campus against a brick wall, 
holding signs displaying course names missing from 
Yale’s Blue Book: “Yale will not teach me contemporary 
narratives on the Philippines and the United States,” one 
read. “Yale will not teach me Asian American medical 
systems,” stated another. The photo campaign spurred 
the hiring of more Asian Americanist scholars such as 
Professors Daniel HoSang and Lisa Lowe and enabled 
a larger set of courses in Asian American Studies. That 
year, too, Yale announced a new initiative, providing $50 
million over the next five years to support the recruitment 
and development of an “excellent and diverse faculty.”


Soon thereafter, Yale began to prioritize the hiring of 
Asian American faculty and created the Center for the 
Study of Race, Indigeneity and Transnational Migration 
(RITM). Located at 35 Broadway, the center supports 
The Asian-American Task Force meets to 
discuss how to increase awareness, enrollment 
and offerings of Asian-American studies courses at 


the field of Ethnic Studies at Yale and became the home for 
the study of Asian American migration and diaspora. As the 
RITM and the ER&M program took over the work of hiring 
and retaining faculty devoted to Asian American Studies, 
the AASTF discontinued. 


Yet despite this ostensible progress, students remained 
dissatisfied. Stefani Kuo, who graudated Yale in 2017, 
had arrived at Yale hoping to double major in English 
and Theater Studies. After two years as an English major, 
however, she had taken Yale’s only class on Asian American 
literature and was frustrated about “just how little” Asian 
American writing she had been exposed to. “There just 
wasn’t a range of Asian American writing or literature 
classes I could take, especially in the English major.” Kuo 
did not have a single professor who was an Asian woman. 
“Even the classes that were of interest to me were not 
taught by people who looked like me,” she said.


Kuo eventually dropped the English major and focused 
solely on theater. Her first play, “Architecture of Rain,” 
included an all Asian American student cast. “The play was 
from a personal perspective. I wasn’t just making something 
up,” Kuo said. In the play, Kuo reflected, she could delve 
into her Asian American identity and experiences that felt 
visceral to her but that she couldn’t articulate in her classes.


In fall 2018, Katherine Hu took Professor Mary Lui’s 
class on Asian American History, which inspired her 
to advocate, as a YCC representative, for more course 
offerings in Asian American Studies. “[The course] made 
me realize that there’s a lot of Asian American history that’s 
been erased, and so many Asian American students feel like 
they’re not part of the conversation, or they don’t have a 
voice in politics,” Hu said. Hu is pushing for a curriculum 
that emphasizes an intersectional look at issues that span 
across a range of minority groups. For this reason, she thinks 
“that creating a separate program would be antithetical 
to the philosophy of learning.” Hu said that classes don’t 
necessarily need to have “Asian American” in the title to be 
considered part of the Asian American Studies curriculum. 
In high school, Hu didn’t often think about her Asian 
American identity, she told me. She grew up in Texas, in 
a town with a large Asian population, where being “too 
Asian” was seen as a negative characteristic. At Yale—
where 19.3 percent of the undergraduates identify as Asian 
American—she at first wanted to break away from an “Asian 
American bubble,” so she didn’t engage with the AACC. 
When she saw Lui’s “Asian American History” in the Blue 
Book for the fall 2018 semester, she realized a piece of her 
education was missing. Her high school history teachers, 
Hu said, “never talked about Asian American history,” 
except as “a kind of footnote.” She felt that Lui’s class gave 
her an opportunity for the first time to learn about her own 
history and the history of Asian Americans more generally. 
Hu praised large introductory courses like Lui’s, which 
taught her new techniques for thinking about identity and 
intersectionality. 


Through her YCC project, she hopes that students will 
find their own spaces in Asian American studies courses. 
“I’m trying to create a space for people who want to know 
their own history that has been taken from them,” she 
explained. Hu plans to work alongside Professor Gary 
Okihiro to start a student working group that would put 
together and publicize classes that consider Asian American 
identity, Asian diaspora, and Ethnic Studies. Next year, 
professors Lisa Lowe and Daniel HoSang will offer larger 
foundational lecture courses for those who want to learn 
more about Asian American Studies and Ethnic Studies but 
might not know where to begin. 


Mary Lui was the first full-time Asian Americanist 
scholar at Yale when she joined the faculty in 2000. Lui, 
who is one of the thirteen professors who withdrew from 
ER&M, sits with her arms crossed in her office in Timothy 
Dwight College. With passion in her voice, she stops me 
every now and then to clarify what I’ve asked. Before she 
arrived at Yale, only one Asian Americanist had ever worked 
at the University, on a part-time basis. The year 2000, Lui 
said, seemed like a wonderful moment for Asian American 
scholarship at Yale: new Asian American faculty members 
were being hired and more classes in Asian American 
studies were being offered. 


In January, following the YCC town hall last December, 
Lui told me that Asian American studies at Yale had again 
grown significantly after student protests in 2015 that called 
for more curricular diversity. She noticed an increase in 
courses related to Asian American Studies, alongside a 
growing number of tenured Asian American professors. 
These developments, Lui said, made it seem less necessary 
to create a formalized Asian American Studies program. 


In recent months, with ER&M in flux and a growing 
worry that an Asian American Studies program would be 
insular and too narrow in scope, faculty members and 
students have been resistant to the idea of a distinct Asian 
American Studies program. “There’s this tension with 
the desire of institution-building,” Professor Sunny Xiang 
told me. “How do you build spaces that are institutionally 
secure while also critiquing the terms of that? While 
building Asian American studies, ‘more is better’ can’t be 
the horizon of our politics—[it has to be a greater] desire 
for knowledge.” 


Dean Joliana Yee of the Asian American Cultural Center 
echoed Xiang’s sentiments, explaining that students must 
continue to think about the ways in which the Asian 
American experience is intertwined with other marginalized 
experiences. “What’s the point of telling history if we are 
not advancing all marginalized communities?”
