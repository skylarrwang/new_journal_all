EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The baby lies on her back 
in the ﬂat space 
provided by her father’s forearms
stretched from his chest
as if carrying ﬁrewood.
In his palms, he holds the back 
of her head. She breathes in 
his wordless song.
I’m afraid he will drop her,
and this walk to athe library
will be marked by a bloody spot,
no bigger than the books 
I carry. I’m not ready
to see this death. I’m not ready
to imagine it. I don’t turn 
my head to look back at them
after they pass.
I want to keep it—
that feeling of both 
peace and worry in seeing
him hold his child
like an offering
while mumbling to the sky. 
I feel the father’s hands
and the daughter’s smallness
push against the inside
of my skull. My walk is slow.
I feel my body wanting
to settle into the silence
between heartbeats.
Don’t let me, father, 
walk off your palms
into the quiet
we do not seek.
