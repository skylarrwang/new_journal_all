T
he aldermanic chambers were so packed that 
people had to sit on the floor, stand in the aisles, 
or even crane their necks from the hallway 
outside, where the crowd had overflowed. It was loud. It 
was hot. And the people inside the chambers were angry. 
Activists from New Haven Rising – an organization that 
campaigns alongside unions for solutions to the jobs crisis 
– waved signs reading “HIRE US” and “Yale: Take the 
Lead!” Yalies fanned themselves with fliers. Concerned 
New Haven residents read the sheets Yale representatives 
had handed out, cataloguing the university’s record of 
local hiring in the past three years. Other New Haveners, 
who had tried and failed to find work at Yale, prepared to 
give short testimonials. It was February 21st, 2019. Yale 
was making a public report on its progress toward a 2015 
pledge to increase the number of workers it hires from 
New Haven.

In that pledge — which Yale officials publicly signed 
in December 2015 — the University promised to hire one 
thousand New Haven residents into permanent full-time 
jobs. At least five hundred of these residents had to come 
from “neighborhoods of need,” a term used in the pledge to 
refer to communities in New Haven where the jobs crisis is 
particularly severe, including Dixwell, Dwight, Fair Haven, 
The Hill, Newhallville, West River, and West Rock. At the 
February hearing, Janet Lindner, Yale’s Vice President for 
Human Resources and Administration, initially claimed 
that Yale had far surpassed these figures, hiring 2,591 New 
Haven residents, including 627 from neighborhoods of 
need. But both city alders and representatives from Yale’s 
Local 34 and Local 35 unions immediately questioned 
those numbers. Lindner had counted 1,431 post-doctoral 
associates – temporary graduate researchers, not permanent 
hires, as stipulated by the original contract. Board of Alders 
President Tyisha Walker-Myers also questioned whether 
journeymen construction workers should be counted, 
since they were being hired for short-term contracts and 
already had credentials. Discounting the journeymen, Yale 
had hired only 876 of the promised one thousand New 
Haven residents. Only 273 of the promised five hundred 
came from neighborhoods of need.

Over the course of the four and a half hour hearing, 
forty-five speakers gave three-minute speeches, several of 
which were recounted by the New Haven Independent. 
Since graduating from Wilbur Cross High School three 
years ago, Carlos Hernandez said he had applied multiple 
times for a service job at Yale. Despite his experience in 
kitchens and hospitals, Yale rejected all his applications. 
Jamie Schmidt tried for eight years to get a full-time job 
at Yale. Although she held a business degree, she was 
told that she wasn’t qualified. And Karen Harrison, a 
grandmother living in West Rock, said she had been trying 
for six months to get a full-time job at the dining hall she 
works in, ever since her hours there were cut. 
“Today I am one of those that’s struggling,” Harrison 
said at the hearing, as the Independent reported. “I’m one 
of the ones that’s going to have my lights turned out. I’m 
one of the ones that isn’t going to have food. I’m one of the 
ones that might not hawve heat or a roof over my head. I 
just wanted to be one of those who get good-paying jobs 
that they promised us.”

Some of the youth activists present discussed the 
connection between violent crime and unemployment. 
They argued that more local jobs would save the lives 
of youths killed on the streets. (While violent crime in 
New Haven has been steadily decreasing over the past 
decade, there were still ten homicides in 2018.) Others 
noted that many of the neighborhoods of need have high 
Black and Hispanic populations; Yale’s failure to hire from 
these communities, they claimed, made it complicit in 
racial injustice. And Rev. Scott Marks – Director of New 
Haven Rising – said that “this failure has revealed that 
the University’s hiring process is deeply flawed, and New 
Haven residents are not being treated fairly. Our residents 
can succeed in Yale jobs, but the current hiring process 
erects walls that prevent them from having a fair shot.” 
Since the 1970s, when factories began to close en 
masse, New Haven has experienced economic decline and 
high unemployment levels. If all New Haven jobs went to 
New Haven residents, then the jobs crisis might be over. 
According to Free Speech Radio News (FSRN), in 2015 
there were eighty-three thousand jobs in New Haven, 
more than half of which paid a living wage of at least 
twenty dollars an hour. “But only nine thousand of those 
living wage jobs are held by New Haven residents,” FSRN 
reported, “and only two thousand of them by residents 
in the city’s low-income neighborhoods.” Though Yale is 
the city’s largest employer by a significant margin, FSRN 
reported that in 2015, less than a third of its employees 
lived in New Haven.

Throughout the February hearing, several questions were 
reiterated, again and again. Is Yale genuinely committed to 
local hiring? Is it committed to hiring workers from low-
income neighborhoods – to ending the jobs crisis that has 
existed in these communities since the 1970s? 


When Joelle Fishman moved to New Haven in 1968, 
the Elm City was a factory town with Yale at the center. 
She remembers that New Haven was seething with activity 
back then — an activist’s city, filled with Vietnam War 
protesters, soon to be caught up in the trials of several 
prominent Black Panthers, but also a worker’s city, filled 
with industries and good union jobs. Over the coming 
years, the industries left, the factories closed down, and 
the newly unemployed workers looked to Yale for work. 
Fishman’s husband took a job at Yale. She joined the New 
Haven People’s Center, a local hub for immigrant rights, 
labor activism, and other social justice causes.

The People’s Center has been in New Haven since 1937. 
It’s a weather-worn brick townhouse rising three stories 
over Howe Street; over the years, it’s served as a homeless 
daycare center, a site on the Connecticut Freedom Trail, 
and a meeting place for Union 1199, which represents 
workers in the healthcare industry. The door is usually 
unlocked. The first floor is filled with relics of activism: 
pictures of quilts from the Connecticut Freedom Trail, 
a photograph of some of the youth activists in Elm City 
Dream, and a patchwork quilt decorated with scenes and 
quotes from the civil rights movement. “We are not afraid, 
we are not afraid / We are not afraid today,” reads one of 
the quotes, referencing Pete Seeger. “Oh, deep in my heart 
I do believe / We shall overcome some day.”

Fishman is older now: wrinkled, a little hunched, but 
just as active in community organizing today as she was 
in 1968. She’s become the coordinator of the New Haven 
People’s Center. When she talks about the jobs crisis in New 
Haven, about the longstanding pattern of discrimination in 
Yale’s local hiring, it’s with a clear and steady voice. “A lot 
of work, a lot of commitment, a lot of determination” — 
that’s what brought Yale to the negotiating table in 2015, 
Fishman believes, and that’s what will bring it back in the 
future. “It was basically taking anger and frustration in the 
community and turning it in a positive direction. Saying, 
‘let’s do this together.’”

There are several reasons why Fishman believes that 
Yale has a duty to hire from neighborhoods of need. One 
is that the city’s economic decline has disproportionately 
affected communities with high populations of racial 
minorities. In 1937, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation 
(HOLC) created a “residential safety map” of New Haven, 
indicating which areas in the city were “safe” to invest 
in and which areas were supposedly too hazardous for 
investment. HOLC’s map also noted which neighborhoods 
had been “infiltrated” by racial minorities; none of the 
safe neighborhoods had any infiltration, while many of 
the hazardous neighborhoods included descriptions such 
as “given over largely to Negros employed as domestics.” 
(Infiltration was used by HOLC as an official term.) This 
map – a form of redlining – prevented many residents 
of the hazardous neighborhoods from obtaining home 
loans or other basic services. It also accentuated racial 
segregation in the city. 

When industries left, the redlined communities 
(those that HOLC had marked as hazardous) suffered 
inordinately. In 2011, the Connecticut Center for a New 
Economy (CCNE) published a comprehensive report 
detailing the history of economic inequality in New Haven 
over the past few decades. Among other things, this report 
compared the economic evolution of Newhallville, a 
redlined community that relied heavily on jobs from the 
gun company Winchester Repeating Arms, and that of 
East Rock, one of New Haven’s wealthier neighborhoods. 
In 2011, fewer than 6 percent of households earned less 
than $10,000 in East Rock; 20 percent did in Newhallville. 
27 percent of households earned more than $100,000 per 
year in East Rock; 6 percent did in Newhallville. East Rock 
is over 80 percent white. Newhallville is more than 80 
percent African-American. 

Yale didn’t help HOLC draw its map of New Haven, 
and Fishman doesn’t claim that the university is directly 
responsible for racial segregation in the city. But she does 
think that the university is complicit in New Haven’s racial 
inequality, in part because it has historically hired few 
residents of redlined communities. She thinks that Yale’s 
commitment to hire from neighborhoods of need is a 
necessary redress for past discrimination: for past attempts 
to shut out the “hazardous” portions of New Haven.


When Fishman came to New Haven in 1968, Yale 
President Kingman Brewster was advocating a plan that 
would physically separate the University from Dixwell, 
Newhallville, and other redlined neighborhoods by 
extending interstates I-91 and I-95 around the campus 
in a circle. “There was a lot of opposition,” Fishman 
recalls. “It was called a moat. It was stopped by community 
organizing.” She remembers a day, not long after this 
plan was defeated, when her husband brought home a 
memo from Yale warning new students about “dangerous 
people” they might encounter on the streets. “It was 
coded language,” Fishman says. “It was racist.” And she 
remembers yet another day, years later, when a highly 
qualified African-American woman was denied a job at 
Yale in favor of an outside candidate. A local union filed 
a grievance; the professor in charge of hiring — who also 
lived outside New Haven, near the outside candidate — 
explained his rationale with surprising candor during the 
grievance hearing. “It’s true that the two women are equally 
qualified,” Fishman remembers him saying. “But because 
I’m more comfortable with the woman from my area, that 
makes her more qualified than the other woman.”

Near the end of the CCNE report, the authors claim 
that what New Haven needs above all is a jobs pipeline: 
“a large-scale, comprehensive program…to educate, 
train, and hire local residents.” Shortly after the report 
was published, rallies and protests began in earnest. In 
December 2011, one thousand people marched in a rally 
against income inequality, carrying “Occupy New Haven” 
posters above them. In April 2012, nearly two thousand 
people marched from the New Haven Green to Yale
