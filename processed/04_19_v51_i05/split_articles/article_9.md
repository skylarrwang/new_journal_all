EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Just west of Yale’s West Campus, 
past the condo complex and the 
Restaurant Depot on Edison Road, past 
the candy roll-shaped signs blaring “PEZ 
PEZ PEZ” at oncoming trafﬁc, past the 
glass ticket booth where you exchange ﬁve-
dollars-plus-tax for a raspberry-red lanyard 
and a construction-paper I.D. designating 
you as an “Adult $5.00,” is a pedestal. On 
that pedestal, which rises to a height you’d 
consider chest-high if you were a Child 
3-12 $4.00 instead of an Adult $5.00, is a 
round blue button. If you press that button, 
nothing happens. 

Then, out of nowhere, from the top of 
what you assumed was just a blue load-
bearing pillar, a giant baseball-capped 
head lurches backward, revealing, where 
its neck should be, a massive hole, out of 
which emerges the largest piece of PEZ 
candy you’ve ever seen, a veritable bathtub 
that looks like it’s going to plop out of the 
pillar and pulverize you. The tub teeters, 
half-ejected, holding your life in its candied 
hands. Then it retreats back into its hole, 
shrouded by the blue-billed head that 
returns to its pike with a knowing smirk. 
That’s how I meet PEZ Boy, who, 
at fourteen feet tall, is the largest PEZ 
dispenser in the world. He’s one of the 
main attractions at the PEZ Visitor Center 
in Orange, Connecticut, which abuts the 
only PEZ factory in North America. After 
we meet, I stuff my identiﬁcation card in 
my pocket and try to blend into the crowd 
of families and expert PEZHeads who have 
decided to spend their Saturday afternoons 
at a candy museum. 

In 1927, Eduard Haas III of 
Austria 
began 
marketing 
his 
PfeffErminZ, or peppermints, as 
alternatives to smoking. In the 
1950s, PEZ-Haas, Inc. got out of 
the adult breath mint business, 
got into the kids’ candy business, 
and moved its headquarters to 
New York City. PEZ bricks, like 
Tic Tacs and Werther’s Originals, 
look more at home in medicine 
cabinets than in plastic pumpkin 
heads, and yet Americans now 
eat three billion of them a year. To satiate that 
demand, the company has developed cutting-
edge ﬂavors like Coffee, Chlorophyll, Menthol/
Eucalyptus, and Yogurt. Of course, the candies 
have always played second ﬁddle to their 
containers, the Batman-, Mickey Mouse-, and 
Santa Claus-headed dispensers ﬁrst introduced by 
Oscar Uxa at the 1948 Vienna Trade Fair. Flick 
the kicker on the nape of Batman’s neck and out 
comes chalky candy stored in the stem where his 
body should be. 

The Orange factory opened in 1974. Its Visitor 
Center came along in 2011, after professional 
PEZ historian Shawn Peterson, voted 2010’s 
PEZHead of the Year by previous winners, 
convinced PEZ’s CEO to open a four thousand-
square-foot museum in the middle of suburban 
Connecticut. Peterson, now the center’s business 
manager, ﬁlled its exhibits with dispensers from 
his personal collection. 

I walk by gold dispensers, Groot dispensers, 
Garﬁeld the Cat dispensers, Garﬁeld the President 
dispensers, unrealistically light-skinned Barack 
Obama 
dispensers, 
unrealistically 
attractive 
Richard Nixon dispensers, no-foot dispensers, 
thin-foot dispensers, thick-foot dispensers, and 
dispensers on functional four-inch heels. I step 
over dispensers embedded in glass ﬂoor displays, 
which remind me of similar displays in the 
documentary Hell House. Except in Hell House, 
the sinful teenagers trapped in the ﬂoor could 
scream and thrash against the glass, whereas these 
voiceless and limbless Hello Kitties can only stare 
up and smile at the Sketchers of their oppressors. 
By oppressors, I mean a) the children who 
are surprisingly excited about moderately edible 
chalk contained in non-edible plastic, and b) their 
parents, who presumably fondly remember the 
same chalk and plastic from their childhoods. One 
guy, who has clearly been to the Visitor Center 
multiple times, gives two women the grand tour, 
dropping impressive amounts of PEZ knowledge 
and asking questions like, “Did you see the little 
winking Pikachu?” If I were part of the PEZHeads 
Email Discussion Group—the PEZ equivalent 
of the Electoral College—I’d vote for him to be 
April’s PEZHead of the Month.

It’s immediately obvious, meanwhile, 
that I’m bad at PEZ. I don’t know 
a spine from a sleeve, or a 
leaf spring from a plastic 
hinge pin. I score an 
eleven out of twenty 
on 
the 
interactive 
PEZ trivia game. 
I reach the back-
corner eleVader 
(named for the 
foot-tall 
Darth 
Vader surveilling 
entrance), 
read 
its 
instructions (“Step 1: Raise your arms. Step 2: Say 
‘Weeeee!’”), consider myself unworthy, and walk 
to the other side of the museum to take the stairs. 
Somewhere by the second-ﬂoor sign asking, “How 
many grasshoppers tall are you?” it dawns on me 
that not only am I bad at PEZ, but I will also never, 
ever, be good at PEZ. I’ll never be a PEZHead. I 
don’t have the nostalgia, the tinkering mindset, 
or the self-conﬁdence required to go around 
telling people you collect decapitated snowmen, 
Supermen, and Rutherford B. Hayeses. Like any 
good American Studies major, I compensate by 
turning insigniﬁcant details into thesis sentences 
like: “The generally phallic appearance of the 
‘Naughty Neil’ dispenser, coupled with suggestive 
Visitor Center advertising slogans like ‘The candy 
with a playmate!,’ suggests a penile obsession at 
the heart of American corporate capitalism.”

None of which helps me when I try to buy 
Captain Marvel dispensers from the laid-back gift 
shop clerk. “Are you just here to buy things today?” 
he asks, with all the coolness reserved for people 
who stand three feet from Secret Life of Pets™ 
memorabilia. Overwhelmed, I answer “yes,” even 
though my journey through the museum makes 
the answer a clear “no,” which in turn makes it 
weird when I pull out my Adult $5.00 museum 
I.D. to take advantage of the $2.00 credit on all 
same-day gift shop purchases. The guy stares 
straight through me to the kicker on the nape of 
my neck and says, “Oh, so you weren’t just here 
for the store,” which I parry with something like 
“yeah,” to which he responds with something like 
“O.K.” while bringing the price of ﬁve dispensers 
down to a trim $8.45. 

I 
escape 
the center and wait for my 
Uber at the PEZ-
colored 
picnic 
tables 
by 
parking lot. A kid of 
about 
kindergarten 
age waits impatiently 
for his mom to snap a 
family photo underneath 
the “PEZ PEZ PEZ” sign, 
then darts toward the front 
entrance. Once his dad gets off 
his phone and opens the door to the 
lobby, the kid shouts, “Whoaaaa! There’s 
a PEZ bench!”

“No wayyy!” his mom yells back, mock-excited, 
while throwing something away by the tables. As 
my Uber driver asks me if I’m just getting off work 
at the factory, and further asks me if I’d like to join 
his free-or-reduced-price home energy scheme, I 
imagine the kid reacting to PEZ Boy. I start to 
wish I were less like his parents, and more like 
him.
