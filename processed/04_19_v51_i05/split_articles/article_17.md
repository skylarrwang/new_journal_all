Others have expressed qualms with the term ‘Asian American.’ 
Professor Gary Okihiro, who was instrumental in creating Asian 
American Studies at Cornell and UCLA, among other universities, 
told me that “the term Asian American is in a way a misnomer; it 
erases the differences between many groups.” Okihiro is also one of 
the thirteen professors formerly affiliated with ER&M.


Echoing Okihiro, some students voiced that Asian American-
specific course offerings at Yale should expand to cover the 
diversity of Asian American identities. “To have a class on Asian 
American history is to undeniably leave people out,” Sana Aslam 
’20, an Anthropology major who has taken several Hindi courses 
and who enjoys studying South Asian diaspora, told me. “I’d love to 
see more classes on Pakistan-American identity, because that’s my 
background,” she said, adding, “I don’t think Nepal, Sri Lanka and 
Bangladeshi-American histories are really represented at all.” 
Students, she said, need to “understand how Asian American 
history is occurring in direct relationship to other histories, 
Women’s and Gender Studies, African American history—so we 
see that it doesn’t come out of nowhere, it comes out of histories 
of exclusion.” 

In response to the YCC’s efforts last fall to institutionalize Asian 
American Studies, students revived the AASTF and have since 
pushed for an intersectional approach to the program. Early this 
“‘There’s this tension 
with the desire of 
institution-building,’ 
Professor Sunny Xiang 
told me. ‘How do you 
build spaces that are 
institutionally secure 
while also critiquing the 
terms of that?’”

semester, members of the task force gathered together 
at the Asian American Cultural Center, where eleven 
students, including Rita Wang and Janis Jin, leaders of 
the task force, sat on the carpet and shared their hopes. 
First-years sat on the couches and on the floor and shared 
their initial experiences at Yale, their apprehensions about 
taking Asian American History as they hungered to learn 
more about their family history but did not know where to 
begin. “What do you want to see this group become?” Jin 
asked, and students responded that they wanted to be part 
of a reading group, where they could read Asian American 
literature and discuss the nuances of their identity that they 
did not feel comfortable sharing with their peers. The room 
felt open, a space where students, who ranged from first-
years to seniors, could share their thoughts and hopes. In 
thinking about how to publicize classes in Asian American 
Studies at Yale, a student suggested that CourseTable, a 
popular student-run website that organizes course offerings 
at Yale, could have a listing of those courses. There was also 
talk of creating a survey course in Asian American studies, 
and starting a weekly reading group, where students could 
discuss pop culture references and academic articles about 
Asian American experiences. 

Everyone involved in the AASTF has also been involved 
in the Coalition for Ethnic Studies, of which Jin has also 
been a leader. Asian American studies, she reiterated, does 
not siphon from ethnic studies but exists within it. Jin values 
the comparative framework that Ethnic Studies affords, as 
opposed to an Asian American Studies program focusing 


For Jin, the importance of Ethnic Studies has been on 
her mind since she was in high school. “I basically came 
to Yale for ER&M when I was a senior in high school,” 
Jin remembered. Jin went to a private high school in the 
“most conservative county in California,” in an area that 
was very homogeneous, as she described it, and mostly 
white and Asian. She said she felt as though she had to 
fight constantly with people about race and politics until 
she discovered Lisa Lowe’s book, Immigrant Acts. Jin wrote 
about the book in her college application essay. Now, she is 
taking a course taught by Lowe, who is one of the professors 
at Yale who recently withdrew from ER&M. Jin said she has 
learned from Professors Lowe and HoSang about the need 
for comparative, relational Ethnic Studies that does not 
focus just on one group, history, or set of struggles, but on 
how they interact. “It blew my mind,” Jin said, describing 
the effect Lowe’s book had on her when she was in high 
school. “Ethnic Studies scholarship became a way to name 
things I was experiencing—it was a body of knowledge that 
could articulate various things about how I saw the world.” 

“I want to offer a different kind of Asian American 
studies,” said Professor Sunny Xiang as we spoke in her 
office. “I want [my] course to be outward-facing, in that 
[students are] taking Asian American literature as a way of 
engaging with race relations, U.S.-Asia relations.”


Earlier that day, I had witnessed this philosophy in action. 
During the hour and fifteen minute-long class period of 
“Asian American Literature” on Wednesday afternoon in 
Linsly-Chittenden Hall, fourteen students of mostly Asian 
American background sat around a small circular table 
and discussed Maxine Hong Kingston’s Woman Warrior, a 
novel centered around Chinese-American girlhood. “The 
novel starts out,” Professor Xiang said quietly but steadily, 
“with the quote: You must not tell anyone.” Her voice was 
not domineering. Her thickly-rimmed glasses rested on the 
bridge of her nose, and her voice and eyes exuded warmth. 
She positioned herself as one of the students around the 
seminar table, not as someone with the most important 
voice in the classroom. She told her students to call her 
Sunny, rather than Professor Xiang. 

“My goal for today is to have everyone say something,” 
she said to the class. “It doesn’t have to be to me, it could 
be to a friend.”


When the class gathered back together, Professor Xiang 
had a student read aloud the quote, “She will add nothing 
if not for necessity, the riverbend of her life.” Minh Vu, 
Professor Mary Lui teaches a class on Asian 
American History and Historiography.
an English major, raised his hand and offered that silence 
in the novel is necessary. From the silence, he expanded, 
we could learn more about the character’s family history 
and her relationship to her mother. Xiang wrote the 
words “necessity and extravagance” on the board in chalk. 
Fragments of Greek were harshly written on the other side 
of the board. 

Later that afternoon in her office in William L. Harkness 
Hall, Professor Xiang said, “We’re reading a book about 
silence, so we want to respect silence in the classroom.” 
When students are not immediately speaking, said Xiang, 
that does not mean they are not involved. 

I meet with Vu that Friday at Blue State on Wall Street. 
At first we stand at the table by the door of Blue State, 
unable to find a seat. It’s a Friday morning, and the rain 
has not stopped. Vu is unassuming and cheerful, offering 
a laugh every now and then, circling with his finger the 
buttons on his shirt. When one of the tables clears, Vu and 
I sit down. Vu reflects on how different the Asian American 
Literature seminar is from his Directed Studies courses 
or other English seminars. “This class is majority people 
of color,” he says. “It’s a community of scholars of color.” 
The experience of feeling different in a classroom where 
the majority of students do not share your background, 
Vu expresses, can be isolating and delegitimizing. Ethnic 
Studies seminars offer a way out of this isolation for 
some students, in texts that corroborate and reflect their 
experiences. 

In the next few years, Vu wants to attend a graduate 
program in Asian American Studies and become a professor 
in Asian American Studies or Ethnicity and Migration 
Studies. His experience as an English major at Yale, in 
which he initially took courses that did not address the 
Asian American experience, made him more curious about 
Asian American literature. His first year, Vu was part of the 
Directed Studies humanities program. “I think the Yale 
English department has a tendency to focus on a formalist 
method, like close reading,” he said. “Sometimes close 
reading pushes you in.” In contrast, during his sophomore 
year, he took Asian American History with Professor Lui. 
The class, he said, was pivotal for him because it drew 
in aspects of his personal life with historiography, with 
assignments like an oral history project. 

Growing up, Vu often felt as though he couldn’t identify 
with the protagonists in the literature he read, which 
centered predominantly on white characters. In Vu’s family, 
he said, “there was not much honesty or open dialogue 
about our history as refugees, and I had a lack of access to 
my history.” Vu attended a largely white public high school 
with mostly white teachers and peers, which compounded 
into an experience of exclusion for Vu that extended 
into his Directed Studies seminars in his first year. This 
semester, in Xiang’s class, Vu read The Gangster We Are All 
– Meghana Mysore is a 
junior in Davenport College.
“Ethnic studies 
scholarship became a 
way to name things I 
was experiencing — it 
was a body of knowledge 
that could articulate 
various things about 
how I saw the world.” 
Looking For by Le Thi Diem Thuy, a Vietnamese-American 
author. Vu, whose parents are refugees from the Vietnam 
War, was drawn to this text because Thuy explains the 
refugee experience through the personal lens of a singular 
family, rather than in dry and abstract academic terms. 
Literature taught in Ethnic Studies seminars has helped 
him to articulate how systems of racial hierarchy operate in 
everyday life, which academic language often struggles to 
capture. “I’m interested in the everyday practice of power, 
and how power is enacted upon minoritized bodies,” he 
said. 

At Blue State, Vu finishes his coffee. Before we leave, he 
turns to me and tells me again that in Xiang’s class, he really 
feels listened to. He thinks this is a common experience 
among his peers in the class, due to Xiang’s warm presence 
and the discussions about literature that expresses Asian 
American experiences. 

“I think it’s really important to be heard,” he says, “and 
that’s how I feel in that class.”
