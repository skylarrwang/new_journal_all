K
aren Burgess sits on the floor of her living 
room, a stretched canvas in her lap. Strings 
tied to the frame extend to a hook on the dry­
wall behind her, holding her painting-in-prog­
ress upright. A loose gray braid drapes over her 
black sweatshirt. She leans carefully into the 
canvas and adds short, precise, sky-blue brush 
strokes. The sky surrounds her pencil sketch 
of the Eight Auspicious Symbols, a collection 
of Buddhist images that includes an umbrella, 
a conch shell, a wheel, and a lotus flower. Lama 
Tsondru Sangpo, a Buddhist born in Tibet but 
raised in northern India’s community of Tibet­
an exiles, squats next to her, peering at her work 
though small, wire-frame glasses. He wears kha­
kis and a yellow button-down shirt, and a string 
of prayer beads hangs around his neck. His dark 
hair, thinning at the temples, sits wrapped into 
a tiny knot at the crown of his head. Through 
the room’s window, I watch Tibetan prayer flags 
wave in the wind, rising above the white clap­
board homes of suburban Hamden. 

Burgess, an art therapist at Yale-New Ha­
ven Hospital, is one of Lama Tsondru Sangpo’s 
newest students. She joins him in his home 
for thangka painting classes every Sunday. 
Thangkas, pronounced ton-kas, are devotional 
paintings originating in the Himalayas. They 
are intended to help Buddhists visualize their 
meditative texts. They are not just depictions 
of Buddhist deities, but interactive, physical 
manifestations of the gods themselves; being 
near the thangkas means being in the presence 
of the deities, which brings good karma both to 
the painter and the viewer. Burgess is not Bud­
dhist, but here in Lama Tsondru’s living room, 
she works under his guidance in what she con­
siders both a spiritual and aesthetic practice. 

She has crafted a conglomerate religion for 
herself, incorporating elements of Buddhism 
as well as other faiths. Thangka painting is one 
part of that spiritual practice.  

Lama Tsondru has been teaching thangka 
painting classes out of his house since he moved 
to New Haven in 1999. His students pay a fee 
of sixty dollars per class. These funds support 
the Gonjang Samten Choepuk Monastery he 
started in Rangbull, India back in 1976. With 
his teaching, he works to maintain an artistic 
and spiritual tradition.

Recently, the circle of devoted painters has 
been shrinking, and commercial tourist imita­
tions have proliferated. Lama Tsondru said that 
many artisans in India and Nepal have chosen 
to forgo the arduous training process. Some cir­
cumvent the recitation of mantras, the medi­
tation, and the consecration that traditionally 
granted the thangkas their power to bring kar­
mic benefit. Instead, they copy and trace old 
thangkas, often losing the original proportions 
of the deities, as written in the texts. These 
mass-produced thangkas Lama Tsondru sees 
back at home concern him. “They are really 
diminishing or destroying our very precious 
thangka tradition,” he said.

In Lama Tonsdru’s monastery in Rangbull, 
the small staff and thirteen students spend six 
years in training, memorizing the Buddhist 
texts and mantras, the proportions, measure­
ments, and angles with which each deity must 
be drawn, and practicing their painting tech­
nique. Lama Tsondru has exhibited paintings 
in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York. 
By bringing this threatened art form to the 
U.S., he intends to partially fund the monastery 
back home.

Though the paintings his Hamden students 
produce may not be of the same technical qual­
ity as those of his monastery students, he asks 
that his four American students follow tradi­
tional practices. They recite the mantras before 
they begin painting, and they draw the deities 
in their correct proportions. They learn to 
work in a specific order: first the eyes, then the 
face, then the body. It can take years before a 
student is ready to begin drawing on canvas. In 
traditional thangkas, each detail is measured, 
precisely and geometrically. “Without following 
the text, without doing the important propor­
tions and measurements, that thangka is not 
considered like a thangka,” Lama Tsondru said.

Even small errors might invalidate the 
thangka as a religious object, an embodied 
artwork. This sometimes causes stress among 
his Hamden students, who don’t practice their 
technique as often as his students in India. “Ev­
eryone else is doing deities,” Burgess laughs. “I
