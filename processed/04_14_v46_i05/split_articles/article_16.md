Behind Bars
A Jamaican immigrant becomes the voice 
of some detained by the Department of 
Homeland Security

O
n a cool November evening in 2012, Mark 
Reid finished his final supper as Inmate 
Number 141754. After three years at the Brook­
lyn Correctional Institution in Connecticut, 
Reid was scheduled for release the following 
morning. The past three years had been some 
of the most trying of his life, but as he leafed 
through the small trove of letters and photo­
graphs beside his bed, the 48-year-old Reid was 
reminded of all that he had to look forward to.

Thanksgiving was just about a week away, 
and after all the time he had spent in a jail cell, 
he felt especially thankful for the chance to sit 
down to dinner with his family. He was the fa­
ther of two children, a son who planned to en­
list in the Navy, and a daughter in high school. 
He had led the comfortable life of a real estate 
broker, with a modest salary and a sense of sta­
bility. His most recent conviction, for the sale 
of narcotics and burglary in the third degree, 
had taken that away.

R
eid’s release from prison should have been 
a fresh start, a classic American story of 
new beginnings. During his three-year incarcer­
ation, Reid’s attitude toward life changed. He 
sought out spiritual and psychological counsel­
ing. He woke up at four o’clock each morning 
to study for a paralegal certification. He imag­
ined a better future for himself and his family.

But as Reid was packing, a prison official 
cut short his second chance. He would not be 
heading home the next morning, the official 
told him. Instead, he would be taken into cus­
tody by Immigration and Customs Enforce­
ment (ICE), a division of the Department of 
Homeland Security, and held in a detention fa­
cility. Just as he was about to leave the criminal 
justice system, Reid was forced into another of 
the nation’s most controversial institutions: the 
immigration detention system.

Reid came to the United States at 14 to 
reunite with his mother, who had left Jamaica 
years earlier to send money back home to her 
family. Years later, an Army recruiter promised 
Reid that time spent in the reserves would 
grant him citizenship. He did not know he had 
to apply. Nor did he know that if he broke the 
law, his green card could be revoked. 

A
t the Franklin County Jail in Greenfield, 
Massachusetts, Reid found that he was 
one of nearly one hundred noncitizens who 
had been detained after some interaction with 
a government agency. Many, like Reid, had been 
charged with violating the terms of their visas 
or green cards by breaking the law. 

Every year, more than 400,000 non-citizen 
detainees are locked up in one of the 250 immi­
gration detention centers in the United States. 
In 2012, ICE detained a record 478,000 people, 
according to the Department of Homeland 
Security. The vast majority of them were from 
Latin American countries, with nearly seventy 
percent coming from Mexico alone. Only 0.4 
percent of those held were from Jamaica, Reid’s 
country of birth. 

Franklin, where Reid was confined, is con­
tracted to house detainees for ICE. Homeland 
Security’s so-called “bed mandate” requires
