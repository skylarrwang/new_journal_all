the unaltered picture. St. Peter’s shirt is a bright cerulean 
blue; the book he holds is a strong scarlet. In contrast, 
St. John wears robes of faded brown. This difference, like 
that of the haloes, arose because conservators cleaned off 
St. Peter, rubbing off the yellowed varnish with chemical 
solvent, but left St. John alone.
“Is that more faithful to the original?” Kanter asks. 
“No. The only thing it’s faithful to is the original materi­
als, not the original look or intention of the picture.”

Anikó Bezur and her team at the CCAP have a dif­
ferent definition of intention. Located in a former phar­
maceutical building on Yale’s West Campus, the CCAP’s 
squat industrial façade cuts a rather figure, especially on 
a rainy afternoon. I arrive sopping wet in the lobby where 
Jens Stenger, a physicist who works at the CCAP, greets 
me and invites me to hang up my rain jacket on the hook 
next to his desk. We walk into the first lab of many, a 
spotless room glittering with dozens of new machines. 
Stenger pauses before each piece of equipment to explain 
its function. One machine reveals which molecules reso­
nate at different frequencies, while another sorts mole­
cules by their size, determining, in a few minutes, exactly 
which elements an oil painting contains.

Bezur joins us in a room housing an electron micro­
scope, which is several feet tall and wide. We make small 
talk for a few moments before I ask her what she thinks 
about Kanter’s view of the relationship between science 
and conservation.

She bursts out: “You talked to Larry?” Then she 
laughs. I ask her what’s so funny. “I just think he has a…
very different perspective,” she says diplomatically.

Bezur becomes more serious as she acknowledges 
the truth she sees in Kanter’s argument. She agrees that 
science has its limits. “There’s no scientific signature for 
Velázquez,” Bezur says. “It’s not like a unique DNA im­
print, unless we were to find his hair and find a match; 
and short of that it’s very difficult to say that something 
was made by this person’s hand.”

Stenger too recognizes that there are certain areas of 
art study in which science is not at all useful. “If you’re re­
ally interested in all the stories and the history, you can­
not uncover who Botticelli was friends with by looking 
under the microscope,” he says. “So there’s this huge area 
to which I think you can really securely say that science 
has very little or nothing to contribute.”

But Stenger and Bezur maintain that scientific analy­
sis can and should be a large part of conservators’ de­
cision making. Through analysis of pigments’ chemical 
structures, Stenger can determine how and from where

an artist long ago acquired his materials, and how they 
were made. The chemical decomposition of a blue color 
tells him when the pigment was made, and a chemical 
analysis of the lacquer used in a varnish reveals the sap 
from which it was made.

Bezur does not devalue Kanter’s expertise. She main­
tains, however, that technological analysis of artwork is 
the truly objective measure upon which museum direc­
tors and others requiring artistic analysis should rely.
“For many, many centuries, people got along just fine 
without the scientists,” she says. She pauses, then con­
tinues sarcastically: “And I love going into storerooms 
and finding the half a million dollar mistake that was 
just based on a good eye and plenty of experience.” She 
laughs. “That’s all I have to say.” 

Kanter and other conservators who rely on their own 
eyes for interpretation are not exactly Luddites. “An art­
ist like Velázquez is more complicated than any other 
artist,” Kanter concedes, “because his painting technique 
was so subtle and so complex that the more you can learn 
about it—including its elemental component materials—
the better prepared you are to know how to overcome 
issues.”

The knowledge gained from Albendea’s radiography 
scan of The Education of the Virgin can deepen art his­
torians’ understanding of Velázquez’s painting process. 
The information is undoubtedly useful for certain kinds 
of research and analysis. But Kanter insists that this data 
remain secondary to expert opinion when it comes to 
restoration, because technology creates credulity: “Peo­
ple are willing to believe whatever an instrument with 
a needle on it will tell them, thinking that that is the 
answer, a Geiger counter.” He maintains that care must 
be taken to use scientific analysis only as supporting evi­
dence, and never as a definitive answer.

But the curator and the chemist often have a com­
mon goal: preservation. The master artists of the past 
conveyed their visions using fragile materials, and we’re 
left to deal with the decay. Bezur and Kanter are shuffling 
through the debris using different techniques, and each 
is wary of the jurisdiction of the other. Both are trying 
to speak up for artists long gone. If only the artists could 
speak for themselves.
