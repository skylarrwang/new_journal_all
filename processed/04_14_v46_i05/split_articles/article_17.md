Every year, more than 400,000 
non-citizen detainees are 
locked up in one of the 250
immigration detention centers 
in the United States.


ICE to fill an average of 34,000 beds in deten­
tion centers each day. The imprisoned include 
victims of torture, asylum seekers, families with 
young children, veterans, mentally and physi­
cally disabled people, and lawful permanent 
residents, like Reid, who face deportation be­
cause of criminal convictions. The system 
comes at a hefty price, costing taxpayers $122 to 
$164 to hold a detainee each day, adding up to 
$2 billion a year.

Immigration lawyers estimate that doz­
ens of the detainees are men and women 
who believed that they were made U.S. citi­
zens simply by serving in the U.S. military. 
Like Reid, they failed to grasp that citizen­
ship was not automatically conferred. Their 
numbers may be small, but their situations are 
particularly distressing since these men and 
women risked their lives for a country now 
pressing to expel them.

Mark Reid was not giv­
en a chance to tell a judge or 
hearing officer that he had 
served in the military for six 
years and that the recruiter 
promised he would receive 
his citizenship in return. He 
didn’t have a chance to talk 
about how he had worked 
to improve himself during 
his recent time in jail. He never had the chance 
to tell an official that he had a place to live and 
a family ready to help him back in New Haven 
because, like many noncitizen detainees, Reid 
was denied an individual bond hearing. This 
would have allowed him to plead for the oppor­
tunity to live in the community while his depor­
tation case was adjudicated. 

Noncitizen detainees are first brought be­
fore a judge, and there an official declares that 
the government has reason to deport them. 
They are then incarcerated until their cases are 
heard and their immigration status finalized. At 
that point, they are either deported or allowed 
to return to their homes in the U.S. Often they 
are locked up for months, even years, until they 
get any such resolution. This practice defies pre­
vious judicial decisions, which found that such 
lengthy pre-trial confinements violate both the 
Immigration and Naturalization Act and the 
Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of 
the U.S., both of which protect the defendant’s 
right to challenge their detention and prohibit 
the government from arbitrarily incarcerating 
them. Prior court cases have set the limit for 
a “reasonable” length of detention without a 
bond hearing at six months.

Immigration officials have little to say on 
the matter. Daniel Modricker, a spokesman for 
the Department of Homeland Security, released 
this statement: “While we cannot comment on 
ongoing litigation, ICE is committed to smart, 
effective immigration enforcement that focuses 
first on convicted criminal aliens, and those ap­
prehended at the border while attempting to 
unlawfully enter the United States.”

But detaining people so excessively is dis­
proportionate to the offense, insisted Nicole 
Hallett, a clinical teach­
ing fellow at the Yale Law 
School who specializes in 
immigration law. She ex­
pressed outrage at the cur­
rent state of detention. 
“You can’t just detain 
people indefinitely,” Hallett 
told me. “It’s not punish­
ment like in prison—it’s im­
migration detention. These 
people have already served their time, so this 
is civil detention—not unlike Guantanamo.” Of 
course, Guantanamo has garnered a decade of 
media attention. Immigration detention issues, 
though, remain in the shadows. 


Long before he ever saw the inside of a jail 
cell, Mark Reid was an aimless 20-year-old 
embarking upon his future in America. It was 
1984, and he had left his troubled childhood in 
Kingston behind several years earlier. He had 
moved to town to town, before moving to New 
Haven to work for his uncle’s construction 
business. 

While he was accompanying his cousin to a 
meeting about formalizing his cousin’s citizen­
ship papers, Reid met an Army recruiter who 
told him about the benefits of military service: 
honor, discipline, and, most importantly, the 
guarantee of United States citizenship. A few 
months later, Reid signed up for the Army Re­
serves. Just before leaving for boot camp, Reid 
said that he called his recruiter to ensure that 
everything was in order with his citizenship.

“You’ll be taken care of,” he recalls the re­
cruiter telling him.

Upon returning from boot camp in Spring­
field, Massachusetts, later that year, he began 
to stray. He started hanging out with a few new 
friends from outside of his church circle.

“They had the new cars, the new sneak­
ers. They were the most popular people in the 
street and I wanted to be a part of that,” Reid 
explained. He was brought up in a family of de­
vout Seventh Day Adventists, and the world of 
drugs was entirely new to him.

Reid quickly discovered that drugs could 
fund the life he envied. Soon enough, he was 
passing his time on the streets, selling and even­
tually using a variety of narcotics. He still spent 
some weekends in Springfield, training with 
the reserves. By the time he was honorably dis­
charged in 1990, he had already had several con­
frontations with the police.


Reid’s first encounter with the law came in 
1986. Still a fresh face on the corner, he 
wanted to establish his street credentials. That 
meant accumulating an arrest record. One day, 
his pockets filled with drugs, Reid intentionally 
circled a police cruiser until he was stopped and 
searched. After discovering that Reid had no 
prior arrests, the officer confiscated the drugs 
and released Reid with a warning. But Reid 
was determined to get arrested, and before 
long, he landed in jail. His sixty-day sentence 
would be the first of several over the course of 
the next two decades, mostly for various minor 
drug offenses. Reid’s life was in turmoil, but 
he barely noticed, he told me. In his world, it 
seemed normal.

“During that time, being incarcerated was 
just another part of being in the streets,” he 
said. “You’d know the majority of people locked 
up. There was nothing telling you that things 
needed to change. I went in and out with the 
same mentality.”

By the time he was due to be released from 
his most recent sentence, in November 2012, 
immigration officials had determined that it 
was too late to change. ICE had decided that 
Reid, a veteran and legal permanent resident 
with no history of terrorist activity, was a “dan­
gerous criminal actor,” and that he should be 
deported.

Reid is among the growing number of de­
tainees who have been caught up under a pro­
gram called “Secure Communities.” Established 
in 2008, Secure Communities requires the FBI 
to share its database of prisoner fingerprints 
with immigration authorities. If ICE officials 
find a match with someone who is in the coun­
try illegally, they can ask local prisons to detain 
them. According to ICE, the program priori­
tizes the deportation proceedings of the most 
“dangerous criminal aliens,” those who pose 
public safety risks. This program was created 
by ICE, rather than Congress; as a result, ICE 
has complete discretion over who is detained. 
Communities, politicians, and academics have 
objected to the program’s premise and scope, 
but they have little power to make changes. 
One of the most vocal local critics of Secure 
Communities is Michael Wishnie, a professor 
at the Yale Law School. “ICE has not backed 
down on Secure Communities,” Wishnie told 
me. “They’ve managed to force it on the entire 
country over the objections of mayors and 
local leaders. They promised that they’d only 
go after violent offenders, but all of the data 
suggest the opposite. The program is sweeping 
up exactly the people [ICE says] are not high-
level targets.” 

Wishnie also warned that Secure Commu­
nities leads to ineffective policing: fear of de­
portation erodes trust between local police and 
New Haven’s immigrant community. 

Detainees face more than just the erosion 
of their constitutional rights. Several newspa­
pers and community organizations have re­
leased reports describing human rights abuses 
in immigration detention centers, from inad­
equate medical attention to meager meals to 
sexual abuse. For Reid, the physical conditions 
in the detention center were humane, but he 
said that the experience was emotionally gru­
eling. Each day, he found himself surrounded 

by throngs of people enduring extraordinary 
psychological stress as they faced possible de­
portation at any time. They were also coping 
with separation from their families, as well as 
financial ruin. Reid knew several people who at­
tempted suicide. He even contemplated taking 
his own life as he struggled to handle the pros­
pect of returning to Jamaica.

“Families 
were 
separated, 
children 
constantly crying, people yelling, screaming, 
worrying,” Reid said. “It was a devastating 
environment.”

Reid’s future looked bleak, but a few New 
Haven organizations heard about his case and 
saw in him symbolic power as a plaintiff. For de­
cades, savvy lawyers have gone to great lengths 
to find complainants who could serve as effec­
tive figureheads for their causes, from Rosa 
Parks to Edie Windsor. In this case, Reid fit the 
bill. He was a veteran, a property owner, and 
a father with strong community ties. He had 
made bad choices, but he had changed for the 
better. Students from Yale Law School’s Veter­
ans’ Legal Services Clinic were among the first 
to take note, and the provided Reid with initial 
support and advising. They were then joined by 
fellow Yale law students from the Worker and 
Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic (WIRAC). 
Both groups are part of the Jerome N. Frank 
Legal Services Organization, which allows law 
students to represent local clients and gain 
courtroom experience under the guidance of 
professors. 

On July 1, 2013, after Reid had been held in 
detention for nearly eight months without the 
opportunity to argue for his release on bond, 
the Yale law students helped Reid file a writ 
of habeas corpus, which required that he be 
brought to court. Guards shackled his hands, 
waist, and feet when he appeared at hearings—
another violation of his constitutional rights, 
according to his lawyers.

Reid also filed a class action lawsuit in fed­
eral court. The lawsuit argued that the govern­
ment unlawfully trapped not only him and oth­
er noncitizens in the ICE system for too long 
without allowing the bond hearing they were 
legally entitled to. Six months later, in Janu-
