n a corner of an industrial building just out­
side of New Haven, a woman points a gun at 
a treasured painting. The weapon is loaded, and 
she is ready to fire. She aims carefully, focuses, 
and pulls the trigger. But this gun shoots X-rays, 
not bullets.

As an X-ray strikes the canvas, it jumbles 
the electrons orbiting an atom of paint. The 
atom quickly reshuffles its particles in order to 
regain its former state of equilibrium. In doing 
so, the atom sends back another ray, which con­
tains information about the painting. The gun 
swallows the ray and transmits the information 
to a laptop, which displays a graph cluttered 
with overlapping peaks of various heights. The 
woman shows me how the peaks correspond 
to elements: “Here, you see, this is copper, and 
here is lead. The lead is probably in a white pig­
ment, called lead white.” No one, not even the 
painter himself, has ever known so much about 
this painting’s chemical composition.

The woman behind the gun is a chemist 
named Anikó Bezur. She is the director of sci­
entific research at the Yale Center for Conser­
vation and Preservation (CCAP), a multimil­
lion-dollar facility built in 2012 to house and 
care for the University’s vast art collection. Yale 
owns more than 200,000 pieces of art, from 
pristine Roman busts of Julius Caesar to paint­
ings by Monet and Van Gogh. 

Bezur and her fellow conservators ap­
proach the works with extensive technologi­
cal expertise. With the data obtained by scan­
ners, lenses, lasers, and other instruments, the 
team generates scientific analyses that inform 
their approach to conservation. But despite 
the millions Yale has invested in the CCAP, the 
institution’s central philosophy—that scien­
tific analysis should take the lead in informing 
conservation decisions—remains controversial, 
even among the curators at Yale.

The first time I meet Bezur, she is work­
ing on a painting stored outside the CCAP, in 
a building called the Library Shelving Facil­
ity (LSF). Located in Hamden, Connecticut, a 
ten-minute drive from campus, the windowless 
industrial building stores books, art, and other 
objects belonging to various Yale collections. 
Bezur greets me with a wide smile and shakes
