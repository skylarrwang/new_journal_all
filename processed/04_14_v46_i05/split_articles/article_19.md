W
e pull into the park­
ing lot with a trunk 
full of guns. I have arrived 
at the Branford Gun Club 
along with Lenny Benedetto 
and his wife Virginia. Both 
are gun enthusiasts and ac­
tive in the anti-gun control 
lobby. Lenny is the vice pres­
ident of the Connecticut 
Citizens’ Defense League 
(CCDL), and his wife is the 
organization’s 
technology 
coordinator. They are out to 
show me that neither guns 
nor their owners are intrin­
sically scary, and today, they 
are going to teach me how 
to shoot. I have never shot 
a gun in my life, and I am 
jittery as we unload safety 
equipment and firearms.

But before I pick up 
a gun, I need to use the 
bathroom. I ask where I can 
do that. 

A tall man with long 
dark hair—one of the cou­
ple’s friends chatting with us 
in the parking lot—crosses 
his arms and squints down 
at me, suddenly even taller. 
I was introduced to him as 
a reporter from Yale, and he 
seems reluctant to tell me 
where the bathroom is. 
“I’m gonna need to read 
the article first,” he says. 
“Which side are you on?”

lmost every gun owner 
I interview asks some 
form of this question. They 
all want to know where 
I stand, because many of 
them believe the media have 
heaped praise on SB-1160—
the Connecticut General 
Assembly’s response to the 
horrific massacre at Sandy 
Hook Elementary School in 
December 2012—while un­
fairly portraying gun owners 
who oppose the law as irra­
tional, paranoid, and crazy. 
They think I am that media. 
Many people refused to talk 
to me because they assumed 
I would take their words out 
of context and turn them 
into caricatures of the red­
neck American prominent 
in the liberal imagination. 
Meanwhile, these gun own­
ers see gun-control support­
ers—and often liberals in 
Connecticut gun 
owners are suing 
their state over 
new gun laws. 
A reporter meets 
them at the 
shooting range.
