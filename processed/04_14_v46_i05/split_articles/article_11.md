nity (YHC) applied to become a member of 
the Yale Religious Ministries (YRM), the com­
mittee that brings together religious groups at 
Yale. Humanism encompasses many schools of 
thought, such as atheism and agnosticism, and 
is based on the idea of a rational system of eth­
ics, according to the website of the YHC. Its 
members do not believe in God, but through 
their meetings and activities seek many of the 
same goals as people of faith. The YHC wanted 
to be a member of the YRM to have its own 
University chaplain, to use University space, 
and to receive University funds. 

Yet University Chaplain Sharon Kugler, 
who oversees the YRM, did not feel it would be 
appropriate to have an official YRM-approved 
humanist chaplain. She denied the YHC’s re­
quest for membership, writing that “the non-
religious nature of the YHC does not fit with 
membership in a group with an explicitly reli­
gious self-definition.” 

The coordinators of the YHC were hardly 
taken aback by the decision—they are, after 
all, an explicitly non-believing group—but they 
remained disappointed. The YHC’s leadership 
is largely composed of Harvard humanists who 
hope to bring Harvard’s inclusive attitude to­
ward humanism to Yale. Harvard has had a vi­
brant humanist chaplaincy since 1991.

“Humanist students should be a part of in­
terfaith conversations and have access to the 
same resources,” says Chris Stedman, head of 
the YHC. With his large white ear-gauges and a 
nose piercing, he hardly looks like your average 
member of the clergy, but behind his movie-star 
smile is a desire to ask hard questions. A former 
evangelical Christian, Stedman is now the as­
sistant humanist chaplain at Harvard, where he 
helps humanist students develop ethics based 
on rationality rather than divinity. 

Paul Chiariello, the YHC’s director of op­
erations, believes that the YRM’s unfamiliarity 
with humanist principles played a chief role in 
the rejection. He and other leaders of the YHC 
insist that non-theistic lifestyles are compat­
ible with virtues frequently associated with re­
ligious morality, such as compassion, honesty, 
and charity.

Even if Yale does not have a humanist chap­
lain, the YHC plans to continue teaching Yale 
students about humanism. On March 5, they 
hosted primatologist Frans de Waal to discuss 
his new book The Bonobo and the Atheist, 
in which he sets up a conversation between a 
Central African ape and a staunch atheist. The 
bonobo advises the atheist “to not get worked 
up about the absence of something, especially 
not something as open to interpretation as 
God.” One wonders what the bonobo would say 
about the rejection of the YHC. 

Chiariello takes the ape’s advice and re­
mains calm. “A large part of our mission is to 
foster a positive image of atheists and human­
ists,” he explained. “This rejection can actually 
be used as a kind of teaching tool.” 

The words “teaching tool” suggest an ami­
cable parting of the ways between the YHC 
and the Chaplain’s Office. The future for hu­
manism at Yale is bright. On the week of April 
7, they hosted a Humanism Week with events 
such as an “Ask an Atheist” panel and “Atheism, 
Storytelling, and Advice for Christians.” Soon, 
perhaps the YHC will offer even more hands-
on options for students to interact with human­
ism. Something like Shabbat dinner at the Slifka 
Center, but without God, faith, or a connection 
to the Chaplain’s Office.
