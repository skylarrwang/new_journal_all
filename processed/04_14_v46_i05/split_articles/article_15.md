very relaxing—it’s like a shower for your brain.” 

A shower for my brain sounds nice. So does 
reduced cortisol (“the stress hormone”), in­
creased self-control, lower risk of heart attack 
and stroke, and a greater sense of companion­
ship with my fellow human beings. According 
to what I read online, TM can make miracles 
happen. It could help me achieve everything 
from self-actualization to world peace: “the 
Maharishi effect,” part quantum physics and 
part social theory, claims that the “unified field 
of consciousness,” which TM creates, can calm 
violent communities. If one percent of the pop­
ulation in any given area practices TM, crime 
rates will, supposedly, fall dramatically.

This seems fuzzy and far-fetched, and I dis­
like how enlightenment has been turned into 
a commodity. But I’m willing to give TM a try. 
The TM center closest to me is in Hamden, 
a few bus stops up Whitney Avenue. It is run 
by Richard and Gail Dalby, a friendly, middle-
aged pair who offer introductory lectures on 
Wednesday nights and more advanced classes 
every couple of weeks. They insist that the $960 
fee is not exclusive, but actually democratiz­
ing: that money funds TM centers around the 
globe. TM, Gail Dolby tells me, “is a worldwide 
phenomenon; an established organization with 
millions of practitioners.” Part of what they’re 
selling is a connection to a larger network, but 
they create the network by selling you the con­
cept of the network. This is how any successful 
large organization—from church to corpora­
tion—works.

But this collective experience also brings 
individual benefits. Judson Brewer, a Yale pro­
fessor whose research is largely focused on the 
neuroscience of meditation, confirms that this 
kind of spiritual experience causes observable 
changes in the brain. At Yale, Dr. Brewer ran 
studies using functional MRI technology to 
map what goes on in the someone’s mind while 
he or she is in a meditative state. What Russell 
Brand can describe only vaguely, Brewer can il­
lustrate via color-coded graphs and articulate in 
scientific language. In layman’s terms, the area

of my brain associated with anxiety, depression, 
cravings, and lying, was probably deactivated 
while I meditated. This happens in the brains 
of novices and experienced meditators alike. 
“After a few tries,” he says, “there was very little 
difference in brain function between those who 
had just started and those who had been medi­
tating for years.” 

Brewer himself is a longtime meditator, fol­
lowing a Buddhist breath-based system that he 
was introduced to in college. He undertakes 
scientific study of meditation, he tells me, be­
cause, “cynically speaking, science is the new 
religion of the West. If we can develop a science 
of meditation, we can develop some faith for 
people who wouldn’t otherwise be open to it.”  
Like Richard and Gail Dalby, he sees the poten­
tial for creating institutions to help make an in­
dividual practice communal; in 2012, he helped 
start a Yale meditation group, YMindful, that 
still meets twice a week.  

Meditation, advocates say, can be useful 
in confronting many of life’s difficulties. New 
Haven’s New Horizons High School—an al­
ternative school for students with academic 
or behavioral difficulties—has introduced its 
students to meditation. Maureen Bransfield, 
the school’s principal, says that the techniques 
helps students “calm down, be more aware of 
their emotions.” Support systems that teach 
and encourage meditation, Brewer believes, 
can also improve the lives of those suffering 
from addiction and chronic pain. When he 
ran the Yale Therapeutic Neuroscience Clinic, 
he worked with recovering smokers who used 
meditation and mindfulness to fight nicotine 
cravings. 

“It doesn’t matter what type of meditation 
you do,” he says. “Any type of mindfulness or 
breath-awareness will help focus the mind away 
from destructive self-referential processes.” 
Large institutions like the TM machine aren’t 
necessary; small, grassroots groups like YMind­
ful can also help people achieve the same re­
sults.

A few minutes into one of my medita­
tion sessions, my thoughts slowly become less 
frantic, less self-aware. There’s a subtle shift, a 
detachment. Instead of dwelling on the day’s 
anxieties, I begin to passively observe my emo­
tions. I drift in and out of thinking about “aim,” 
but focusing even a small part of my brain on 
this three-letter pattern keeps me from being 
obsessed with self-reflection. I begin to feel my 
breath. I begin to incorporate that physical sen­
sation into the progress of my thoughts.  

Once, I have a powerful urge to open my 
eyes and check the timer on my phone. I think 
about how my back and neck hurt, the floor is 
uncomfortable, and my hands are sweaty. What 
if I forgot to set the timer?  I am just about to 
quit when it occurs to me that I don’t have to. 
What else would I do? I let the boredom fill 
me. I consider it from all angles. The moment 
passes. 

Eventually, I breathe deeper and slower. 
The silent chant of “aim” has aligned itself with 
the rhythm of my breath. I feel the breath pull­
ing me, starting lower in my stomach, expand­
ing my diaphragm, and traveling up my chest. 
When I exhale, I feel air rolling out of me, my 
chest deflating, my shoulders rolling backward. 
I am very still. My arms and head feel simul­
taneously very heavy and very light. For a mo­
ment, I almost feel the blood moving through 
my body. I think, “Is this meditating? Am I 
meditating now?” The moment passes. I open 
my eyes and reach to turn off the timer, with 
hands a little less shaky, mind a little quieter.
