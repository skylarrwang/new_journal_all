Trying to Transcend
“A
im, aim, aim.”  I’m sitting cross-legged on 
the floor of my dorm room, eyes closed, 
chanting this word over and over in my head. 
I’m trying to practice Transcendental Medita­
tion, which, among meditators, is known for be­
ing especially simple. But it doesn’t feel simple. 
Am I breathing correctly? Is my posture right? 
How will I know if I’m meditating? I worry that 
worrying about the best way to meditate is get­
ting in the way of meditating, which is exactly 
the kind of paralyzing overanalyzing that caused 
me to consider meditating to begin with.  

I shouldn’t have done this alone, I think. In 
theory, I’m not supposed to. Official Transcen­
dental Meditation (TM) practice begins with a 
lengthy interview with a certified TM teacher. 
The teacher assigns the meditator a personal 
word, or mantra. Next, the meditator attends 
an introductory lecture and four classes. The 
total cost: $960.  

I don’t have that kind of cash, so I turned 
to the Internet to soothe my soul. I found a 
website called www.tm.org, which calls itself 
the “Official Website” of TM. There, I found 
a chart of personalized mantras determined by 
age and gender.  For men aged 35–40, the man­
tra is “shring,” for women, it’s “shrim.” But for 
me—a woman between 15 and 30—it’s “aim.”

I’ve been feeling especially anxious lately, 
full of a nervous, manic energy that makes it 
hard to concentrate. My hands shake, and I 
wake in the middle of the night with the after-
images of vivid dreams. My hope is that experi­
menting with meditation could bring me some 
sense of calm and a more restful mind. I’ve 
decided to try TM because of its simplicity: as 
far as I can tell, it’s meditation for dummies, a 
minimalist practice. All I have to do is sit for 
twenty minutes twice a day silently repeating a 
single word. TM practitioners claim that it of­
fers significant benefits, such as unity of being, 
heightened awareness, and self-control. That’s 
certainly appealing. What’s more, TM stresses 
that it’s not a religion. It doesn’t ask practitio­
ners to change the structure of their lives in any 
significant way. No work. Just the word.

TM began in the late 1950s as the brain­
child of Indian spiritual figure Maharishi Ma­
hesh Yogi. By the 1960s, Yogi was serving as the 
spiritual advisor to the Beatles. Despite its un­
conventionality, TM has lasted into the twenty-
first century largely because it has made itself 
into an institution—building schools, training 
teachers, and perfecting its publicity tactics. I’m 
suspicious of this system. But I’m also intrigued 
by the way TM instructors have taken a solitary, 
silent practice and turned it into something col­
lective—an experience that is both private and, 
because of the formal TM training, shared by 
countless others. I read dozens of online testi­
monials, and find myself overwhelmed. They all 
use the same words: “stillness,” “unity,” “rest.” 
The rhetoric has a certain seductive, chatty 
quality; it combines subjective experience and 
supposedly objective science, and it constantly 
treads the line between earnest enthusiasm and 
syrupy kitsch.  

I’m fascinated by the sheer mass of per­
sonal success stories. Celebrities are particu­
larly enthusiastic. Russell Brand, a comedian, 
former heroin addict, and ex-husband of Katy 
Perry, gives a testimonial on the website for the
