think Lama Tsondru…doesn’t want me to start 
on a deity and then ruin it.” 
T
o begin the class, Lama Tsondru leads stu­
dents in a  mantra to Manjushri, the deity 
of knowledge and wisdom. Lama Tsondru, sit­
ting cross-legged on the floor, begins to chant 
in a deep voice, and his two students follow 
along, reading softly from a transliterated ver­
sion. Each settles into a spot on his living room 
floor and begins to paint. He kneels next to 
Bobby Banquer, a student who has been study­
ing with him for eight years. Lama Tsondru of­
fers quiet corrections, pointing to small modi­
fications that must be made. Banquer brushes 
her graying bangs away and peers through elec­
tric-blue glasses, carefully tapping her brush to 
the canvas. Banquer, a New Haven local like 
Burgess, started taking classes eight years ago, 
after becoming increasingly interested in Asian 
art through her yoga practice.

Once he finishes correcting Banquer’s small 
error, the lama pulls out a large black art case 
and begins flipping through a file of a student’s 
work. He points out pages filled with pre­
cisely proportioned eyes, ink swirls of clouds 
and folding fabrics, and intricately measured 
sketches of the face of the Buddha, the body 
of the Buddha, the bodies of other deities, each 
measured in its precise geometric proportions. 
But some, he says, are not quite right. “This 
face is not so good,” he says, putting two draw-
ings of Tara, a female deity revered for compas­
sion and action, side by side. I can barely tell 
the difference between the two—the eyes of 
one deity are slightly more narrow, the breasts 
more round, the waist more tilted—but Lama 
Tsondru knows which one is correct. “This 
one,” he says, pointing to the other. “This one 
is better, improved.” 

Out of Lama Tsondru’s four regular stu­
dents in Hamden, three are Buddhist. Each 
student aside from Banquer heard about the 
center through word of mouth and became 
intrigued by the merging of spiritual and ar­
tistic practices. Burgess and Sue MacClain, 
another student, had both studied art prior to 
Lama Tsondru’s classes. Initially, they were at­
tracted to the aesthetics of the thangkas, but 
continued their study for the art’s spiritual as­
pect. “The actual time spent working on it is 
very meditative,” said MacClain, who has been 
studying thangka painting with Lama Tsondru 
for almost three years. “It’s a way to become re­
ally mindful about what you’re doing. You have 
to be really present, really look, really see, in 
order to be so precise about it.”

The attention to detail and tradition re­
quired to paint thangkas aligns the practice 
with other elements of Buddhism. In 2007, 
Lama Tsondru formally founded his own cen­
ter for Buddhist teaching, called the Thupten 
Ling Dharma Center. While there are just four 
students who regularly attend Lama Tsondru’s 
thangka painting classes, there are now about 
twenty members of the sangha, the Buddhist 
term for community of practice. Aside from 
Lama Tsondru’s wife and children, the major­

ity of the sangha members are 
Americans, some of whom have 
been practicing Buddhism for 
decades, and others who only 
recently took their commitment 
vows. Lama Tonsdru does not 
require his thangka painting stu­
dents to join the sangha.

Burgess, who is neither a 
member of the sangha nor a fully 
practicing Buddhist, values the 
meditative elements of the dis­
ciplined adherence to the rules 
of thangka painting. “This is 
my church,” she tells me, refer­
ring to the process of painting. 
She has an altar at home that is 
“partially Buddhist” though mix­
ing and matching from different 
religions can get complicated, 
Burgess believes that if she fol­
lows the rules that Lama Tson­
dru has laid out for her, even her 
thangka can create good karma. 
“If it’s done correctly and with 
the right attitude, it has benefit 
for whoever looks at it.” 

L
ama Tsondru’s class is much 
more than a Sunday hobby; 
the students who come in who 
listen to his methodical instruc­
tions enter a tradition, even 
while they adapt it to their New 
Haven routines. The paintings 
that hang in their homes might 
not be as perfect as those pro­
duced in Rangbull, but even as 
the practice has crossed over­
seas, the artisans back in the 
monastery continue their work. 
And in Hamden, the students 
and those who observe their art­
work all benefit from the deities 
conjured on canvas.
