tively harmless looking, decorated with a pink 
camouflage plastic covering near the handle, 
and can no longer be legally bought or sold in 
the state of Connecticut. 
When it’s my turn to handle the Firestorm, 
loading the magazine—a surprisingly difficult 
task that requires overcoming my fear that the 
gun will explode in my hand if I am too force­
ful—calls to mind SB-1160’s ban on the sale of 
magazines that can hold more than ten bullets. 
The Benedettos are concerned that many peo­
ple who carry guns for self-defense on a regular 
basis do not know that their magazines, which 
often hold seventeen bullets, can no longer be 
filled to capacity except at home and inside gun 
ranges. All high-capacity magazines must be 
completely empty unless they are inside a gun, 
and the Benedettos can imagine a police officer 
with a hatred for guns slipping a bullet inside 
an empty magazine to incriminate a law-abiding 
gun owner. They also don’t buy the argument 
that it was generous of the legislature to allow 
gun owners to keep their high-capacity maga­
zines instead of surrendering them to the state, 
and they think the politicians will keep pushing 
for more regulation. 
“They are, I believe, trying to wipe out the 
next generation with this law,” Lenny Benedet­
to says, lamenting the fact that nobody in the 
future will be able to own high-capacity maga­
zines and newly banned guns. “They are crush­
ing the next generation. It’s incremental. They 
nibble away a little at a time.” 

L
ast spring, the Benedettos joined other gun 
owners in testifying against SB-1160 before 
members of the state legislature. Gun control 
bills had not made it to the General Assembly’s 
floor since 1993, but things had changed. The 
Benedettos weren’t surprised when their efforts 
failed. Twenty-eight people, including twenty 
children too young to be named in the matter-
of-fact autopsy reports released by the state, lay 
dead in the small, affluent community of New­
town. Twenty-six died of wounds inflicted by 
a young man armed with a Bushmaster XM15-
E2S semi-automatic rifle legally purchased by 
his mother. She herself had been killed with a 
.22 caliber Savage MK II-F rifle. He ended his 
own life with a Glock 20SF pistol. 
On the afternoon of the shooting on De­
cember 14, 2012, the CCDL issued a press re­
lease expressing grief and horror at the mas­
sacre, acknowledging that the discussion had 
already turned to gun control, and reminding 
everyone that aberrations like Newtown have 
nothing to do with organizations like theirs.
“There have been many statements con­
demning firearms and gun owners as a result 
of this tragedy,” CCDL president Scott Wilson 
said in the press release. “This was an act of de­
ranged behavior from a mentally ill individual, 
not of decent and law abiding people that own 
guns and respect life.” 
The next day, Don Williams, president pro 
tempore of the state Senate, spoke with Senate 
minority leader and current gubernatorial can­
didate John McKinney, who represents New­
town. They agreed to create a special bipartisan 
process to craft the legislative response to the 
tragedy. Working with leaders from both par­
ties, Williams and McKinney established three 
bipartisan task forces. One task force addressed 
school security, another focused on mental 
health, and the third dealt with guns. Each task 
force comprised eight Democrats and eight Re­
publicans, and each met for several weeks of 
hearings and debate. 
As this planning took place, the CCDL con­
demned the gun control measures they foresaw. 
They issued another press release and published 
a message to members on their blog, exhorting 
gun owners to mobilize at the capitol when the 
time came. On January 28, 2013, at the largest 
of the task forces’ public hearings, hundreds 
of gun owners testified from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 
Several weeks later, the gun task force approved 
the new restrictions and an eighty-seven-page 
bill moved to the General Assembly. Because 
the bill was emergency certified—a distinction 
usually granted to measures responding to natu­
ral disasters or facing a tight deadline—SB-1160 
went directly to a floor vote instead of passing 
through standing committees. It passed the 
Senate with 26-10 and the House of Represen­
tatives 105-44. Gov. Malloy signed the bill into 
law on April 4.
Yet the Benedettos and many other gun ad­
vocates who testified are convinced that their 
concerns were not properly considered in part 
because the vote took place just a few hours af­
ter the legislature received the bill. 
“There was no deliberation,” says John 
Sturmer, the owner of JJ Firearms Training, 
who testified at the capitol hearing. “There was 
dictation.”
Scott Bennett, who also testified, claims 
that the language of the bill largely came from 
gun control advocacy groups such as the Brady 
Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. “What 
process?” Bennett says. “This stuff was pre-
written and they just put it all together and 
rammed it through.”


T
oni Boucher, Sturmer’s state senator, was 
the Republican co-chair of the school se­
curity committee. She called the entire process 
“tense and contentious.” But Boucher believes 
that people on both sides of the aisle made seri­
ous compromises. When the negotiations start­
ed, some Democratic legislators supported ban­
ning all magazines that could hold more than a 
single bullet. Republican involvement, Boucher 
says, prevented the most restrictive laws from 
being passed. 
“It was remarkable that on issues that 
sometimes can be so divisive in our national 
politics, we were able to have all four leaders of 
both parties co-sponsor and support that legis­
lation,” Don Williams says. 
Sturmer and Bennett agree that the effort 
was bipartisan, and do not reserve their anger 
for Democrats alone. Both recognize that most 
Democrats in the legislature support gun control 
more than their Republican counterparts. Both 
feel betrayed by the Republican leadership 

that allowed Democrats to claim Republican 
support for their proposals. Neither buys the 
claim, advanced by Republicans like Boucher 
and McKinney, that Republican presence at the 
negotiating table improved the outcome for gun 
owners. In fact, Sturmer wishes Republicans had 
allowed Democrats to pass a law authorizing 
confiscation of assault weapons, which would 
have been easier to challenge in court. 
The highly restrictive laws Democrats 
would have passed without Republican re­
sistance would have been unconstitutional, 
Strumer said, and therefore easy to tear down. 
“This legislation is the worst-case scenario,” 
Sturmer says. 
But for now, SB-1160 is here to stay. In Jan­
uary, Connecticut district court judge Alfred 
Covello ruled that the law is necessary to pro­
tect the safety of the public, but the CCDL is 
currently appealing its case.
So far, SB-1160 seems to effectively toe the 
line of constitutionality. The Supreme Court 
has affirmed the right of individuals to own 
firearms for “traditionally lawful purposes” 
such as self-defense in the home. SB-1160 
imposes additional regulations on gun owners 
but clearly allows them to continue using their 
guns for shooting practice and self-defense as 
they have in the past. For those who choose to 
comply with all the regulations, after they pay 
fees for registration and permitting, the biggest 
change is the number of bullets they can leave 
in their gun for the drive from home to the 
shooting range. 
Connecticut’s gun laws have traditional­
ly been stricter than those in other states. In 
2011, prior to the passage of SB-1160, the Brady 
Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence ranked 
Connecticut’s laws fifth-strictest in the nation, 
and the state had the sixth-lowest rate of gun 
deaths in the country. 
“Smart gun laws work,” says Ron Pinciaro, 
the executive director of Connecticut Against 
Gun Violence (CAGV). 

he other side can point to facts and num­
bers, too. It’s true that Connecticut has 
the sixth-lowest rate of gun deaths in the na­
tion when suicide deaths are included, but most 
gun owners I talk to do not think gun suicides 
should count towards the statistics—these 
deaths would occur with or without guns. In 
addition, tighter gun laws do not necessarily 
reduce gun violence. According to the Brady 
Campaign, of the twenty-one states that had 
lower rates of firearm homicides than Connect­
icut in 2011, only Massachusetts had stricter 
gun laws. 
In the debate over gun control, objective 
truth is elusive, even when it comes to hard 
numbers. Some elements of the law are just 
coming into effect, and it will be years before 
anyone can assess the impact. Statistics can 
be massaged and cherry-picked, and causation
