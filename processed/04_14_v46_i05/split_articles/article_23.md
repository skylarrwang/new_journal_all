**The Gun Debate in Connecticut: A Year After Sandy Hook**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The new journal does not follow from correlation. Plus, even defining seemingly simple words such as “violence,” can be difficult. Is it violence, Sturmer asks, when a police officer shoots a criminal in the act of fleeing or committing a crime? Yes, I tell him. Sturmer tells me I need to learn the true definition of violence, which he thinks requires an action to be undertaken with the intention of hurting another out of selfishness.

Furthermore, the opposing sides frequently employ the same analogies and thought experiments to reach completely different conclusions. I ask Pinciaro whether any of the elements of SB-1160, as it has been implemented so far, would have prevented the actions at Sandy Hook. He says this question misses the point because not all violence is preventable, but that does not mean we should not pass laws against violent acts.  
“There’s laws against 
murder and people are going
to commit murders,” 
Pinciaro says. “There are 
always people who are going 
to break the law.”

Cheryl Lemos of the 
CCDL makes the same claim 
to explain her opposition to 
SB-1160: even banning guns 
would not end murder, so we should not restrict 
guns in an attempt to reduce violence.  
“The gun is a tool,” Lemos says. “Take away 
guns, people use knives.” 

A major issue facing the success of the law is 
its enforceability. Though everyone I met 
at the Branford Gun Club said they had registered their guns, most owners of assault weapons haven’t. Yet Connecticut’s Department 
of Emergency Services and Public Protection 
(DESPP), which oversees the state police force 
and keeps records of firearm registration and 
pistol permitting, has not announced any plans 
to confiscate guns or prosecute those who failed 
to register their guns. SB-1160 made possession 
of an unregistered assault weapon a Class D 
felony, punishable by one to ten years in prison. 
The state keeps records of people who undergo 
background checks to purchase assault weapons. So, theoretically, DESPP could cross reference those records with the registration forms 
they received. 
“We’re not even stepping in that direction,” 
DESPP spokesman Paul Vance says. 

The records of background checks and pistol permit applications could have allowed the 
state to directly notify gun owners of the new 
requirement to register. Boucher says she contacted DESPP in August to ask the department 
to do that. It didn’t, but individual legislators 
publicized the law heavily.

Still, some people may have fallen through 
the cracks. Benedetto says he has met several 
people who didn’t register simply because they 
didn’t hear about the changes. He is concerned 
that unwitting gun owners might be charged 
with a class D felony while being questioned 
about a lesser offense. Da­
vid Hartman, media liaison 
for the New Haven Police 
Department, says it would 
be unfeasible to go door to 
door to track down weapons, so picking up gun owners in the course of routine 
police work is exactly what 
will happen. 

Can a law be considered 
effective if it is not truly enforced? Pinciaro and 
Williams say yes, because the ban and registration requirement together will reduce the likelihood of assault weapons falling into the illegal 
gun trade, and some paper trail is better than no 
paper trail at all. But if the state won’t expend 
resources to enforce the law, just how important 
does it really consider that paper trail? Actively 
searching for weapons and arresting offenders 
might be politically unpalatable, but refusing to 
do so sends a strong message that it doesn’t actually matter whether the law achieves its aim, 
lending credibility to gun owners’ arguments 
that SB-1160 was just a political show.

Most gun owners I spoke to have maintained 
skepticism about the state’s intentions, but 
they are steeling themselves for the crackdown 
that may or may not come. The CCDL’s 
membership has grown from about 1,500 
members to 13,000 over the last two years, 
“Take away guns, 
people use knives.”

**Shooting Practice**
**Page number(s): 29**

Gingerly holding the pink camouflage Firestorm, I manage to slap the magazine into 
the gun. It’s time to shoot. Lenny tells me to 
form an isosceles triangle with my body. I’m not 
quite sure what this means, but the couple approves my stance: feet apart, arms straight out, 
elbows locked. Lenny tells me to lean forward. Point the sight where you want the gun to fire. 
Squeeze the trigger with the pad of your index 
finger. Wait for exactly the right second to fire 
before realizing that second won’t come. Fire.

The moment is loud but anticlimactic, and 
mostly I feel relieved that I am capable of shooting a gun. I go through a few magazines, and 
several times I get pretty close to the bull’s-eye, 
which isn’t saying much because a helper moves 
the target close to where I’m standing. It still 
feels good, and the Benedettos are encouraging 
teachers. I smile when I quickly fire off a few 
shots that all nearly meet their mark. 
“Nice shot!” 
“You look like a fucking badass! Dead bad 
guys!” 

My target is designed so that when a bullet 
pierces the black paper, a neon pink, green, or 
orange ring appears around the hole. The rings 
look like Skittles. But a different kind of target 
sits on a table near the front of the range: a 
bullet-pocked plastic model of a pale human 
torso, smeared with red paint imitating rivulets 
of blood streaming down a chest. Perhaps a gun 
is not inherently a tool for evil, but despite gun 
owners’ assurances that shooting is a wholesome 
hobby, the bloody chest makes me think the 
gun’s capacity for violence is part of its appeal.

I practice indoors for a while and then go 
outside to watch Virginia Benedetto shoot down 
bright flying orange discs called pigeons. After 
about four hours, the Benedettos drive me back 
to campus. I carry as souvenirs my pastel-dotted 
target and one of the pigeons I failed to hit with 
a shotgun. The Benedettos shrug off my thanks 
and say they’re always happy to take first-timers 
shooting. 
 “You’re one of us now,” Lenny Benedetto 
says. “You got a gun in your hands, you pulled 
the trigger, and you smiled. You’re one of us 
now.”

I walk back to my dorm and pull the target sheet out of my purse. I toy with the idea 
of hanging it up, but the colorful rings would 
dominate the white wall like a trophy. Still, I 
intend to keep it.

shooting a gun.
