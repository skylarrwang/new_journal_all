my hand. She leads me into a room filled with 
artwork placed on countertops and propped up 
on easels: the LSF’s conservation lab.


Bezur is there to examine the painting in 
the far corner of the studio, the one with the 
X-ray gun pointed at its surface. Called The 
Education of the Virgin, it depicts the Virgin 
Mary’s mother, St. Anne, teaching her how to 
read. The young Mary, draped in a dusky red 
robe, occupies the center of the scene, with her 
parents on either side.


For eighty years, the work was stored, un­
noticed, in the basement of the Yale University 
Art Gallery. Without a signature or any other 
identifying features, it was one of many works 
of unknown origin. But in 2004, a junior curator 
named John Marciari unearthed it and showed 
it to his superiors. Convinced that the painting 
was the work of an identifiable artist, curators 
at the Gallery embarked on an international 
quest to authenticate it. Today, experts recog­
nize the painting as a lost work by the Spanish 
master Diego Velázquez, one of the most im­
portant painters of the 17th century.


Held upright in the LSF by a large wooden 
clamp, The Education of the Virgin is severely 
damaged. Gashes mar its surface, a missing cor­
ner leaves an angel headless at the top of the 
painting, and abrasion has worn down much of 
the paint, disrupting the delicate brushstrokes 
that define Velázquez’s work.


Bezur is working on this painting along­
side her colleague Carmen Albendea. Albendea 
worked on projects in Madrid, Los Angeles, 
Baltimore, and Cambridge, England, before 
coming to Yale in 2012 specifically to determine 
how best to treat the Velázquez in its cracked 
and injured state.


Her goal at the moment is to create a com­
prehensive picture of the chemicals that exist 
in the painting—the base coat, the paint, and 
the varnish—in order to treat the painting’s 
wounds. 


But she also wants to study Velazquez’s 
painting process. To do this, she uses another 
tool, an X-ray radiography machine, to scan 
the canvas. This machine can reveal materials 
hidden beneath the top layer of paint to help 
the scientists understand the artist’s drafts and 
mistakes. A printout of that scan, around five 
feet tall and four feet wide, hangs on the wall. 
It looks like an X-ray you’d see in a doctor’s of­
fice: pearly white shadows outline Mary and St. 
Anne against a pitch-black background.


The printed scan reveals a small table in 
the left-hand corner of the painting. The table 
is laden with bulky objects, invisible in the 
real painting. The original sketch was painted 
over, and is now obscured by the resting arm of 
Mary’s father.


Armed with this kind of information, Al­
bendea plans how best to repair the work. Some 
changes are scientific: She will choose a paint 
that can heal the cracks but is easily remov­
able, in case a future conservator wishes to redo 
her work. Others are aesthetic: She will decide 
whether to repaint the angel’s missing head, or 
whether to leave it as a testament to the age 
of the painting. She will determine how best to 
replicate the delicacy of the brushstrokes that 
once covered the surface of the canvas. For now, 
Albendea is still gathering data to determine 
the next chapter in the painting’s story.


But some at Yale place less stock in sci­
ence’s ability to aid conservators. Among them 
is the Chief Curator of the Yale University Art 
Gallery, Laurence Kanter, who also works as a 
professor of early Italian art in Yale’s History 
of Art department. When we meet, he wears 
a brown suit jacket and speaks in a low tone, 
barely audible over the bustle of the gallery, 
where he has worked since 2002. Kanter previ­
ously curated at the Metropolitan Museum of 
Art in New York City and the Museum of Fine 
Arts in Boston. He considers the data produced 
by scientific analysis to be decidedly secondary 
to the information that an expert eye can ex­
tract from a work of art.


“Science isn’t a way to prove anything,” 
Kanter says. “It’s just more evidence, more data. 
The proof is in the interpretation.”


Kanter strolls around the six galleries of 
early Italian art in the museum. He has played 
an important roll in acquiring the collection. 
We walk past ornate frames hung on walls of 
midnight blue. Mary, Jesus, and a collection of 
saints look back at us, their heads ringed by 
gold haloes.
