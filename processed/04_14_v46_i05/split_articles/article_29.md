novel, there are dramas on the level of the body, 
like an eating disorder or an addiction. In my 
essays, I write about disease and empathy in a 
medical context. That attention to bodies is ev­
ident in craft too. When I’m writing nonfiction, 
I walk into a room and take the time to note 
all of these physical particulars, because I know 
that when I’m writing the scene two weeks lat­
er, I’ll be so frustrated if I can’t fill that scene 
with tangible details. I have to build my muscles 
as a nonfiction writer to satisfy the same aes­
thetic impulses that I carry over from fiction.

There’s a part in the book’s title piece in which you 
think of saying to the people around you that your 
experience [in this case, as a medical actor] might ap­
pear in a book someday. As you have moved toward 
nonfiction, do you operate with that thought in mind? 
I do think that that sort of double vision, think­
ing about an experience in terms of how I might 
someday write about it, does creep up on me all 
the time. In that way it’s like being a traveler 
who’s constantly taking photographs, thinking 
about how to document the thing rather than 
just living inside of it. Sometimes that makes 
me feel a little bit sad, or claustrophobic, or 
like my experience is wrapped in this shroud 
of constant self-awareness. But there’s some­
thing productive in it. Left to my own devices, 
I would never talk to a stranger on a bus ride. 
But especially if I’m traveling and I’m like, I 
want to write about this place, I’m more likely 
to convince myself to start up a conversation 
with somebody. Because who knows where it 
will go or lead?

Does a desire to create a public point affect how in­
tensely you pursue a story, or do you just jump off the 
cliff and assume that something will show up?

I guess I like to believe that any story that I’m 
interested in could potentially have a public 
point, because I believe that one person’s inter­
est usually points to some deeper shared root 
system of interest. I usually have some sense 
of what I think the kernel of that point might 
be before I jump off the cliff. But not always. I 
think there can be something really satisfying 
about working your way towards a point.

I’m working on a piece about a whale that sci­
entists have been tracking for years. They call it 
the loneliest whale in the world, because it has 
a frequency that’s much higher than other blue 
whales. And whenever scientists track it, it’s 
alone. I had a sense that there was some more 
abstract point here that has to do with our re­
lationship to loneliness, or why we project feel­
ings onto animals, or how we try to make the 
natural world make emotional sense—but I 
didn’t have a clear sense of what the center was 
going to be.

You’ve taught students in English 120, “Reading and 
Writing the Modern Essay,” and your parents were 
professors. What does your relationship to teaching 
feel like?

The energy of teaching is so different from 
the energy of writing. I still get a little bit of 
an adrenaline rush before I walk into a class­
room, I love that you have an experience that’s 
bounded in time, you’re hearing other people’s 
voices, and there’s a dynamism in responding to 
their ideas. All that is different from the pro­
cess of sitting down to write in ways that feel 
very saving and energizing to me.

That feeling of giving students permission to 
write stuff that feels thorny and tricky and un-
figured-out is fun. It feels like I’m doing a ser­
vice by granting them license to dig deeper into 
ideas they already have in inchoate form. I’ll 
remember those times when I hit my own con­
ceptual tangle in a piece, and I can hear myself 
telling a student: “that’s a good sign, go deeper 
into it.”
