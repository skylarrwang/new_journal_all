Ask her if you can pull the car 
over and pray.
Your daughter says yeah, 
and you almost keep going 
because you’re expecting a 
no.  
You open the car door, 
and an exploded blue pen 
falls out onto the dirt road.
Leave the car door open 
because it’s not a busy road 
but pick up the pen and put it 
in your pocket 
that’s already ink-stained.
Your daughter watches out 
the car window at your back
as you cut through the long 
grass 
and under one ash and a 
couple of cedar trees.  
Look up at the sky for a 
couple of seconds 
and then look down. 
And your glasses are about to 
slip off your face.
Over your cream turtleneck 
you’re wearing a red and 
green Christmas sweater, 
But, yes it is still October, 
isn’t it.
It’ll only take a minute.
Then, back in the car you go, 
saying something 
about the trees.
Then you’re home, pulling up 
alongside the barn 
where your other daughter is 
bringing in the Haflinger for 
the night.
She says, “Mamma watch” as 
she lets her go trotting into 
the stable without a lead.
Let your daughter see you 
starting to go angry 
And then almost like you’re 
going to cry, 
And she’ll know it’s an 
answer.
When you step into the 
kitchen and out of your boots 
you’ll say, “what does anybody 
want for dinner.” 
Empty a pocket on the table.
Out comes a folded up piece 
of paper.
You ripped it.  Seem upset.
Be ready for your daughter 
to say “that’s alright mamma 
we’ll fix it together.”
But just sort of leave, the 
ends of your socks hanging 
way off the tips of your toes.
That daughter of yours wipes 
down the counter and flattens 
out the creases of the paper, 
sees 
it’s not even legible—not 
even 
English she doesn’t think,
and that her mamma still has 
the other half, don’t you?
She’ll slide it behind the jar of 
coins
on the ledge beside the bowl 
of potatoes.
They’re not good enough to 
eat, not bad enough to throw 
outside.
She’ll climb up on that ledge, 
take down 
the dusty floral curtain, 
looking for a moment at the 
willow branch laying in the 
yard.
When she makes a frustrated 
sound and you ask “what?”
from your bed two rooms 
away
she’ll say, “I stepped in the 
dog’s water dish.”
