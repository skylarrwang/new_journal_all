Although the gold still shines, peeling wood 
on the frames and cracks in the paint reveal 
these works’ age: They were created by pre-
Renaissance masters in the thirteenth and four­
teenth centuries.


Over the past 700 years, many of these 
paintings have suffered significant wear. Expo­
sure to harsh light has faded their colors; heat 
and moisture have warped the wood behind the 
paint; dust and dirt have settled in the cracks 
and yellowed the varnish that overlies the tem­
pera. In some cases, the original works have 
been painted over by past conservators who 
thought they were improving or restoring the 
work.


Caretakers must carefully consider which 
cracks to fill with modern paint and how to 
repair large swatches of lost color. Kanter ar­
gues that a historian, not a piece of equipment, 
must answer these questions. He is well versed 
in the history of art conservation at Yale. Walk­
ing from painting to painting in the gallery, he 
recounts the conservation decisions that have 
determined the way the works look now. 
 “This is the problem,” he says. “Science and 
aesthetics are not compatible undertakings. 
They don’t need to be compatible. Nobody 
wants them to be compatible.”


To illustrate this point, he stops in front of 
a pair of portraits hanging side-by-side, one of 
St. Peter and the other of St. John the Baptist. 
A single artist of unknown identity painted this 
pair in Siena, Italy around the year 1320. The 
portraits are extremely similar: the saints look 
directly at the viewer, wearing slightly worried 
expressions.


Both saints sit on a backdrop of gold leaf. A 
thin circle—a halo—circumscribes their heads. 
Other patterns are impressed and inscribed be­
tween the halo and the head to alter the gold’s 
reflectivity. Just outside the halo is a concentric 
circle of triangular patterns composed of three 
small dots, punched into the gold to emphasize 
the contour of the halo.


Although the artist created the back­
grounds of the paintings in the same way, they 
look noticeably different today. St. John’s por­
trait looks much like it did 700 years ago, with 
patterns of distinct circles ringing the halo. But 
St. Peter’s halo is instead surrounded by dull tri­
angles, the three dots blurred together. 


The difference was not an artist’s error, but 
a result of differing attitudes toward conserva­
tion. Yale conservators treated the painting of 
St. Peter, gouged with holes, in the sixties. They 
left the painting of St. John, with its pattern of 
delicate circles, untouched. 


The modifications to the former painting 
reflect a certain trend in art conservation in the 
sixties. “There was a lengthy moment in [the art 
gallery’s] history,” Kanter says, “when the insti­
tution felt that all of its conservation practice 
should be guided by scientific inquiry, produc­
ing particularly horrifying results.”


In treating the painting of St. Peter, the 
1960s conservator attempted to remove debris 
that had settled into each small hole punched in 
the pattern. Though he removed the dirt care­
fully, he also, inevitably, removed the tiny flakes 
of gold leaf that had kept the small holes sepa­
rate and distinct.


“All he was interested in was the materials, 
not the impression,” Kanter says. “The dirt en­
hances the original effect; it doesn’t obscure it.”


The picture treated by conservators differs, 
too, in that its colors are stronger than those in
