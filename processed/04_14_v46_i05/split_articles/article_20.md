general—as hopelessly ignorant and unfit to 
contribute to the dialogue because they, like 
me, have never even held a gun. The terms 
“grabber” (as in “gun grabber”) and “libtard” get 
tossed around a lot in reference to Democratic 
politicians and their supporters by members 
of CTGunTalk, an online forum where state 
gun owners discuss everything from politics to 
shooting competitions. If some of the forum 
posts confirm liberals’ stereotypes of gun own­
ers, they also reveal how genuinely and deeply 
the state’s gun owners believe that they are un­
der attack by reporters, by the legislature, and 
by their own friends and acquaintances who 
just don’t get it. 

On the other side, President Obama, 
Connecticut’s Governor Dan Malloy, and 
gun control activists across the nation have 
celebrated SB-1160, which gave Connecticut 
some of the strictest gun laws in the country. 
Signed into law last April, the legislation expands 
the ban on assault weapons to include dozens 
of additional models, tightly restricts the use 
of magazines (ammunition containers) that can 
hold more than ten bullets, and requires owners 
of such weapons and magazines to register 
them with the state. It requires background 
checks for all transfers of guns between owners, 
rather than only for purchases from gun shops. 
It also requires a permit to purchase long guns, 
which are braced against the shoulder. The 
law is jargon-laden and confusing in places, 
but clear in its intent. It exists to reduce the 
availability of the semi-automatic assault 
weapons often used in headline-grabbing mass 
murders: Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, 
and Sandy Hook. SB-1160’s supporters see the 
law as a model that other states should follow. 
But to the Benedettos and other gun owners 
who support CCDL, SB-1160 encroaches on 
the rights they hold dear.

It is too early to tell if the law will work. 
Exact figures are hard to come by, but the Na­
tional Shooting Sports Foundation estimates 
that there are 300,000 assault weapons in the 
state. Only fifty thousand were registered as 
of mid-March, according to Lieutenant Paul 
Vance, spokesman for Connecticut’s Depart­
ment of Emergency Services and Public Pro­
tection (DESPP), which is handling the reg­
istration. Now that the registration deadline 
of January 1, 2014 has passed, there is no way 
for owners of illegal guns to comply with the 
law unless they surrender their weapons. This 
means that there are hundreds of thousands of 
newly illegal firearms all over Connecticut. And, 
due to a loophole that co-sponsor Senator Don 
Williams says was completely unintentional but 
unlikely to be closed with additional legislation, 
no one is required to register assault weapons 
manufactured before 1993, when Connecticut 
enacted its first and more limited ban on assault 
weapons. This also means that plenty of older, 
powerful weapons similar to those used in mass 
shootings can still be legally bought and sold in 
Connecticut without registration. 

“Every time the politicians squawk, I go 
buy more,” the long-haired bathroom guardian 
declares shortly after we arrived at the range. 
“You gotta go buy more,” agrees Lenny 
Benedetto. It’s considered a patriotic duty 
to flout the spirit of the law. Many CCDL 
members view SB-1160 as a violation of the 
Second Amendment. Chris and Cheryl Lemos, 
CCDL’s membership coordinator and blogger, 
call this amendment “the right that guarantees 
all other rights.”

When I ask them if there is any gun control 
measure they support, they laugh.
“Well, I don’t think people should have gre­
nade launchers,” Cheryl Lemos says.

Encroaching on gun ownership rights, 
CCDL members believe, could lead to the ero­
sion of one right after the other, and they think 
gun control supporters are blind to this fact.
“I’m sure the folks at Yale would be having 
all kinds of conniptions if they took out the 
First Amendment,” Cheryl Lemos says. 

Reverence for the Second Amendment 
leads these groups distrust America’s govern­
ment. New Haven resident Carl Roehrich, 
who brought a group of novice shooters from 
his church to the Branford Gun Club the same 
day I was there, says he purchased six “pre-ban” 
assault weapons after he found out about their 
unintentional legality. 

“I wanted to make sure that I would have 
these rifles specifically because they did not

want me or any Connecticut citizen to have 
them,” Roehrich says. 

Roehrich believes that one day—perhaps 
not in his lifetime, but not in the far-off future, 
either—the American people will be forced 
revolt against their government, if the govern­
ment does not first turn its guns against the 
people. When that happens, Roehrich is under 
no illusion that his assault rifles could effectively 
counter the most powerful and technologically 
advanced military in the world. Roehrich does 
not want to risk ceding his guns to the state, 
and he believes registering guns heightens the 
likelihood of eventual seizure. 

Despite suspicion that registration could 
lead to confiscation, the Benedettos and all oth­
er CCDL executive board members registered 
their guns in compliance with SB-1160 to avoid 
attracting negative attention 
to their organization. While 
reluctantly adhering to the 
law’s requirements, they also 
publicly and strenuously op­
posed it. The CCDL board 
filed a lawsuit, which was 
dismissed by a federal judge 
in January but which they 
hope will go all the way to 
the Supreme Court. They 
have endorsed two Republican gubernatorial 
candidates, Joe Visconti and Martha Dean, who 
are “pro-Second Amendment.” They have held 
events like a March “Open-Carry Brunch” at 
Bagel King of Bridgeport, at which gun owners 
were encouraged to proudly carry their weap­
ons. On April 5, a year and a day after the pas­
sage of SB-1160, they held a rally outside the 
capitol building in Hartford, drawing thousands 
from all over the Northeast. CCDL’s online 
post to its members before the rally presented 
these armed Americans as victims of an oppres­
sive state, persecuted but proud, safe only in 
numbers: “We need every person there to make 
our voices heard.”  

T
he gun issue is political, but a gun itself is 
a machine. In theory, one should be able to 
regard guns apolitically, to utilize them without 
wading into the turgid partisan whirlpool sur­
rounding them, to view them apart from the 
conflicting visions of America. Particularly at 
the Branford Gun Club, where members enjoy 
target practice and trap shooting while eating 
donuts together, I expect guns will be discussed 
primarily as a hobby. But every interaction with 
a gun presents an opportunity to reflect on an 
element of the law. 

The Benedettos are quick to emphasize 
that guns can be used safely. When he picks me 
up on Chapel Street that morning, Lenny Bene­
detto assures me that his SUV is “loaded up 
with guns.” Of course, the guns are not loaded. 
He laughs his distinctive belly laugh at the ab­
surdity of his own tough-guy talk. It is a twenty-
minute drive to the club. After we arrive, the 
Benedettos start taking out “eyes and ears—
glasses to improve visibility and provide ocular 
protection, and oversized 
earmuffish contraptions to 
muffle the sound of gun­
shots. They give me a pair 
of yellow glasses and a set 
of red earmuffs. I look like 
an army recruit undergoing 
basic training sponsored by 
McDonald’s.

We go inside the range, 
a squat building where sev­
eral people stand in a line to shoot at not-so-
distant targets. As he opens the first case and 
pulls out a .22 caliber Firestorm pistol, Lenny 
Benedetto tells me the first rule of guns: “Nev­
er point a gun at something you don’t want to 
destroy.” The second rule: never put your fin­
ger on the trigger until you’re ready to shoot. 
The third: always assume the gun is loaded. 
The implicit political point Benedetto is try­
ing to make is that people who do bad things 
with guns are unlike the Benedettos and their 
friends and acquaintances, who ought not be 
punished for the sins of those who refuse to re­
spect and understand their weapons.  

As Lenny instructs me in basic gun safety, 
Virginia Benedetto, a soft-spoken Tennessee 
native with impressive aim, shoots a round with 
the Firestorm. The Benedettos selected this 
gun, which Virginia says she hasn’t shot in years, 
specifically for my instruction: it’s small, rela­
Lenny Benedetto tells me 
the first rule of guns: “Never 
point a gun at something 
you don’t want to destroy.”
