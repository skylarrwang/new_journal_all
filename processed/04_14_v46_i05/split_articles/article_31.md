I know many lovely girls who 
wait on beaches, I know turtles
 
birth themselves by their egg’s
nervous stirrings. They rock 
their little circles in the sand.
The globe shakes itself too, but 
it rests on no sand thus
leaves no mark. I rose up 
from the sand, I’ll admit. 
My skin a salt lick the sun 
won’t even acknowledge.
The waves threaten me daily
with their animal shapes. 
I name each billow and roller
And cry at their breakage. 
I own no bowls, and no spigot,
but my mouth and my hands.
I swallow the ocean one cup 
at a time. These marks me 
a prophet- now give me a cave.
I’ll take in some visitors,
The muscled heroic ones
strewn on my shores with 
their large ships in pieces. 
I’ll fill their palms then their 
lungs then I’ll flood them with
promises. Cast them back to the 
beaches and tell them to wait.
