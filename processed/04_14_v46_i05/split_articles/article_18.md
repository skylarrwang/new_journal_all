ary of 2014, Judge Michael Ponsor first ruled 
in Reid’s favor. Ponsor found that the govern­
ment had attempted to defend its detention 
practice based on a “dubious interpretation” of 
immigration law and had offered “irrelevant” 
and “flawed” arguments. A month later, Judge 
Ponsor ruled that Reid was not alone, but that 
he was indeed one in a “class” of people suffer­
ing similar injustice, who were all entitled to file 
a class action lawsuit. Judge Ponsor’s ruling re­
lates only to detainees in Massachusetts, where 
ICE confines most noncitizens from Connecti­
cut slated for deportation, but immigration ac­
tivists around the country are looking to this 
case as a bellwether for similar situations in 
other jurisdictions.

“Every story is unique, but people don’t 
realize just how common this is and how dis­
ruptive it can be for people in the community,” 
said Conchita Cruz, a Yale law student who is 
part of the WIRAC team. Deportation may be 
a civil offense, but it feels like criminal punish­
ment for all parties involved.

A
fter Judge Ponsor’s ruling, ICE was forced 
to grant Reid a bond hearing. On Febru­
ary 3, 2014, a full sixteen months after Reid 
had been taken into custody by ICE, students 
from WIRAC represented him at the hearing. 
He was granted release on $25,000 bond until 
his case is resolved. He told his story in an op-
ed in The Hartford Courant, and the publicity 
helped him raise the $25,000 he needed for the 
bond and his release. On February 25, he was 
released from Franklin. His lawyers from Yale 
“They promised that they’d 
only go after violent offenders, but 
all of the data suggest the 
opposite.” 
Michael Wishnie, 
Yale Law School Professor
drove to the jail to embrace him as he walked 
out of the prison gates. Then, they brought 
him home.

As he waits for resolution of his case, Mark 
Reid recognizes that he is fortunate compared 
to most noncitizens facing potential deporta­
tion. Eighty-four percent of people in immi­
gration detention lack legal representation—a 
particular problem for noncitizens, who often 
speak little English, and cannot understand the 
charges and proceedings against them. Reid, 
again at home in New Haven, spends his days 
visiting with friends and family and working 
with his lawyers. Since his release, he has spo­
ken on behalf of other detainees in immigra­
tion court. He is currently working to receive 
proper certification to represent detainees in 
an official capacity.

Thousands of other noncitizens are still 
held in detention centers around the country. 
Some detainees now look to Reid as the face of 
a class action suit that they hope might soon 
bring them some relief. But the legal battle will 
have to intensify for long-term results. “In the 
vacuum of federal action,” Wishnie said, “local 
leaders have had to do it, but eventually it’s go­
ing to have to happen on a federal level.”
