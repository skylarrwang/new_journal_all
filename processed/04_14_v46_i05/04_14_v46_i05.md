**Title: When the Dinosaurs Come Out**
**Author: Hanh Nguyen**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
At the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History, glass cases around an exhibition hall hold fossilized, 75-million-year-old dinosaur eggs. But three eggs, under incubator lamps and the watchful eyes of Peabody staff, are not like the others. While the others lie still, as they have for millions of years, these speckled blue eggs wobble and shake in their enclosure. They contain the stars of this special exhibition, Tiny Titans: Dinosaur Eggs and Babies: three baby emus.

On March 15, as the Peabody shut its doors for the day, the first baby emu poked through its shell. By the time the museum opened the next morning, the three fuzzy-bodied chicks had fully hatched. Crowds gathered, and even more joined in online via livestream as the chicks took their first long-toed steps only a few feet from their unborn Mesozoic ancestors.

A sign at the opening of the exhibit proclaims: Birds are living dinosaurs. With interactive games and painted artwork, the exhibit explains this relationship, highlighting the unexpected evolutionary connections between dinosaurs and birds. The baby emus drive the point home.

Human understanding of the connections between dinosaurs and birds dates back almost a century. Richard Prum, professor of ornithology in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale and a head curator at the Peabody, said that researchers have worked to understand the link between dinosaurs and modern birds since the discovery of the first dinosaur egg in the Gobi Desert in 1923. But certain questions about the dinosaurs’ own lives remained: Scientists didn’t quite understand the relationship between dinosaur parents and their children. Conventional wisdom dictated that dinosaurs laid eggs and left their babies to fend for themselves, but a 1958 discovery of a fossilized dinosaur nest in Montana led scientists to the revelation that instead of simply laying eggs and leaving, dinosaurs lavished attention on their offspring. The evidence indicates that dinosaurs actively parented their young—providing nourishment, shelter, and protection against predators—much like birds do today.

The connection between birds and dinosaurs involves not only genetics but also shared behavior. “Birds have obligatory parental care—they don’t just litter eggs and leave them in the sand,” Prum said. “It turns out now we have great fossil evidence that this capacity is actually deeply dinosaurian. At dinosaur nests, there are individuals that have been fossilized in the act of at least protecting if not incubating their eggs, and this implies that aspects of bird biology are actually dinosaur biology.”

Of all birds, emus are among those most closely related to dinosaurs. This closeness manifests itself in behavior as well as appearance. Females lay the eggs, but males watch over them and then care for the young. This behavior was previously believed to be exclusive to emus and other flightless birds such as ostriches and kiwis. But paleontologists have concluded that these birds raise their young in the same way as theropod dinosaurs, such as the T-Rex, did. Because of these similarities, emus really are the most scientifically appropriate way to bring dinosaur behavior to life. “When kids see dinosaur eggs and then see live emus running round, they won’t forget that birds are dinosaurs,” said Richard Kissel, director of public programs.


Space constraints prevented the Peabody from hosting an emu dad to fully demonstrate dinosaur-parenting behavior, so the babies had to put up with a human father. Jim Sirch, the museum’s education coordinator, rotated the eggs in the incubator, as their father would have done. Two weeks after they hatched, the emus returned to their original home in Massachusetts. In about two years, when they have reached sexual maturity, they too will be ready to coddle their chicks, just like their dinosaur ancestors. 

But with every bird circling the New Haven sky, we’re reminded that dinosaurs are more than the monsters in the movies—they’re also our familiar neighbors.


**Title: Blueprints Go Green**

The Dynamic Augmented Living Environment (DALE) is a long name for a small house. The structure looks more like a robot, or an especially large computer. Its sides and roof are covered with solar panels, and its large windows let the light shine into the minimalist interior. The two modules can slide apart to create an outdoor space for entertaining guests, grilling hamburgers in the open air, or enjoying a starry night. DALE demands a second glance. This strange looking structure, and other buildings like it, might be at the forefront of a new design movement. That’s what the house’s creators, students from the Southern California Institute of Architecture and California Institute of Technology, were hoping when they entered and won the U.S. Department of Energy’s 2013 Solar Decathlon, a biennial contest that invites aspiring engineers, architects, and environmentalists to create their own sustainable houses.

Kate McMillan ’16 and Juan Pablo Ponce de Leon ’16 are now embarking upon the same challenge: designing and building an elegant, energy efficient home. Leading a team of twenty-nine Yalies, they have spent months drafting budgets, securing funding, and making blueprints for the competition deadline in October 2015. Yale will compete in the Solar Decathlon for the first time since the competition was initiated in 2002. The requirements are daunting. Entries are judged and scored in ten categories, including market appeal, home entertainment, and energy balance. The house must have all the amenities of a normal home, including a dishwasher, television, and stereo system, but it must run entirely on solar energy. With an eye toward the future, the Department of Energy also requires that the house be capable of charging an electric car—all in a building that does not exceed a thousand square feet. 

The team is now working about twenty hours a week, preparing to build a prototype of the house at Yale’s West Campus. Their current design includes a communal space, and two bedrooms with a bathroom in between, to imitate a house for roommates post-graduation. “It’s an architecture thing: your house has to have a story,” said Robert Loweth ’16, who specializes in engineering. “We thought that was what we could most easily relate to.” McMillan expressed a similar sentiment, saying that they were going to focus on a theme and not just “cherry pick” the best features and technologies.

There’s a catch: new technology often comes at a high price. In an effort to curb expenses, the competition awards full points in the affordability category only if the construction costs less than $250,000. The DOE only provides $50,000, so the rest must be raised through donations. McMillan says raising the rest of the money was one of the most challenging parts of the project. These funds came from a variety of Yale-affiliated institutions as well as for-profit companies. “There were people who said we were a little crazy when we told them what we needed,” McMillan added. 

The house could be cheaper if solar power were already an efficient technology, but as Loweth pointed out, “you need a fairly big surface area of panels to be generating a significant amount of energy.” The competition requires that the houses run on solar power, but Loweth believes that the design should focus on reducing overall energy usage instead of just touting solar panels as “the energy solution of the future.” Current strategies include installing low-energy lights and heating the house through water pipes in the floor rather than through the standard air ducts. 

Michelle D. Addington, a Yale professor of sustainable architecture design, and Michael Oristaglio, the executive director of the Yale Climate and Energy Institute, are advising the team. But the undergraduates have spearheaded the team and will remain responsible for seeing their project to completion. They have set the standards high. “We want a house that is seamless in design,” Ponce de Leon said. But, at the same time, it’s an experiment. Ponce de Leon emphasizes that the team is seeking innovation over perfection. “People are often reluctant to take risks,” he explained. “But if we want success, it’s something we need to take.”

The Solar Decathlon team hopes that the house will inspire architects, engineers, and homeowners to “reëxamine the way we live, and to strive toward a more sustainable future,” said Thaddeus Lee ’17, another team member. They are searching for a unified design precisely to encourage the expansion of solar housing. Some houses will be auctioned off while others will return to their home schools.

Even with dozens of innovative and creative models to choose from, it remains difficult to convince the public to reconsider what makes a home. Our suburbs are sprawling and our streets are lined with identical colonials. But as energy costs rise, our architecture and infrastructure might begin looking more like something out of “The Jetsons.” Green architects are working to meet modern challenges, designing smaller houses that are energy efficient and able to withstand extreme storms. 

The DOE’s competition page states that the Solar Decathlon seeks to prepare students to participate in the nation’s clean-energy workforce, and to show the public that “green” houses can be comfortable and affordable. “If I were building a house on my own twenty years down the line, this is what I’d be trying to do,” Loweth said.

Though passionate about their project, the students know that sustainable design has a long way to go. Even after the blueprint is perfected and the model is built, convincing a society to rethink its conception of a home will be a difficult task. But the eighteen houses that began as blueprints could be the path to a greener future.

John Davenport, Jonathan Edwards, and Timothy Dwight are now the names of residential colleges where Yale undergraduates live. But when these early leaders of Yale’s community were alive, they envisioned the University as an academy for aspiring Congregationalist ministers. Needless to say, the niche for faith at Yale has undergone a radical change over the centuries. 

Religion on campus is no longer the focus of a Yale education. Instead, it has become a peripheral resource to many and a community for some. The University Chaplain’s Office exists to accommodate the needs of students for whom religion remains important. The office seeks to foster “respect and mutual understanding among people of different faiths and cultures,” says Muslim Chaplain Omer Bajwa. 

But last semester, questions were raised about the office’s commitment to inclusiveness. In October, the Yale Humanist Community

nity (YHC) applied to become a member of 
the Yale Religious Ministries (YRM), the com­
mittee that brings together religious groups at 
Yale. Humanism encompasses many schools of 
thought, such as atheism and agnosticism, and 
is based on the idea of a rational system of eth­
ics, according to the website of the YHC. Its 
members do not believe in God, but through 
their meetings and activities seek many of the 
same goals as people of faith. The YHC wanted 
to be a member of the YRM to have its own 
University chaplain, to use University space, 
and to receive University funds. 

Yet University Chaplain Sharon Kugler, 
who oversees the YRM, did not feel it would be 
appropriate to have an official YRM-approved 
humanist chaplain. She denied the YHC’s re­
quest for membership, writing that “the non-
religious nature of the YHC does not fit with 
membership in a group with an explicitly reli­
gious self-definition.” 

The coordinators of the YHC were hardly 
taken aback by the decision—they are, after 
all, an explicitly non-believing group—but they 
remained disappointed. The YHC’s leadership 
is largely composed of Harvard humanists who 
hope to bring Harvard’s inclusive attitude to­
ward humanism to Yale. Harvard has had a vi­
brant humanist chaplaincy since 1991.

“Humanist students should be a part of in­
terfaith conversations and have access to the 
same resources,” says Chris Stedman, head of 
the YHC. With his large white ear-gauges and a 
nose piercing, he hardly looks like your average 
member of the clergy, but behind his movie-star 
smile is a desire to ask hard questions. A former 
evangelical Christian, Stedman is now the as­
sistant humanist chaplain at Harvard, where he 
helps humanist students develop ethics based 
on rationality rather than divinity. 

Paul Chiariello, the YHC’s director of op­
erations, believes that the YRM’s unfamiliarity 
with humanist principles played a chief role in 
the rejection. He and other leaders of the YHC 
insist that non-theistic lifestyles are compat­
ible with virtues frequently associated with re­
ligious morality, such as compassion, honesty, 
and charity.

Even if Yale does not have a humanist chap­
lain, the YHC plans to continue teaching Yale 
students about humanism. On March 5, they 
hosted primatologist Frans de Waal to discuss 
his new book The Bonobo and the Atheist, 
in which he sets up a conversation between a 
Central African ape and a staunch atheist. The 
bonobo advises the atheist “to not get worked 
up about the absence of something, especially 
not something as open to interpretation as 
God.” One wonders what the bonobo would say 
about the rejection of the YHC. 

Chiariello takes the ape’s advice and re­
mains calm. “A large part of our mission is to 
foster a positive image of atheists and human­
ists,” he explained. “This rejection can actually 
be used as a kind of teaching tool.” 

The words “teaching tool” suggest an ami­
cable parting of the ways between the YHC 
and the Chaplain’s Office. The future for hu­
manism at Yale is bright. On the week of April 
7, they hosted a Humanism Week with events 
such as an “Ask an Atheist” panel and “Atheism, 
Storytelling, and Advice for Christians.” Soon, 
perhaps the YHC will offer even more hands-
on options for students to interact with human­
ism. Something like Shabbat dinner at the Slifka 
Center, but without God, faith, or a connection 
to the Chaplain’s Office.

K
aren Burgess sits on the floor of her living 
room, a stretched canvas in her lap. Strings 
tied to the frame extend to a hook on the dry­
wall behind her, holding her painting-in-prog­
ress upright. A loose gray braid drapes over her 
black sweatshirt. She leans carefully into the 
canvas and adds short, precise, sky-blue brush 
strokes. The sky surrounds her pencil sketch 
of the Eight Auspicious Symbols, a collection 
of Buddhist images that includes an umbrella, 
a conch shell, a wheel, and a lotus flower. Lama 
Tsondru Sangpo, a Buddhist born in Tibet but 
raised in northern India’s community of Tibet­
an exiles, squats next to her, peering at her work 
though small, wire-frame glasses. He wears kha­
kis and a yellow button-down shirt, and a string 
of prayer beads hangs around his neck. His dark 
hair, thinning at the temples, sits wrapped into 
a tiny knot at the crown of his head. Through 
the room’s window, I watch Tibetan prayer flags 
wave in the wind, rising above the white clap­
board homes of suburban Hamden. 

Burgess, an art therapist at Yale-New Ha­
ven Hospital, is one of Lama Tsondru Sangpo’s 
newest students. She joins him in his home 
for thangka painting classes every Sunday. 
Thangkas, pronounced ton-kas, are devotional 
paintings originating in the Himalayas. They 
are intended to help Buddhists visualize their 
meditative texts. They are not just depictions 
of Buddhist deities, but interactive, physical 
manifestations of the gods themselves; being 
near the thangkas means being in the presence 
of the deities, which brings good karma both to 
the painter and the viewer. Burgess is not Bud­
dhist, but here in Lama Tsondru’s living room, 
she works under his guidance in what she con­
siders both a spiritual and aesthetic practice. 

She has crafted a conglomerate religion for 
herself, incorporating elements of Buddhism 
as well as other faiths. Thangka painting is one 
part of that spiritual practice.  

Lama Tsondru has been teaching thangka 
painting classes out of his house since he moved 
to New Haven in 1999. His students pay a fee 
of sixty dollars per class. These funds support 
the Gonjang Samten Choepuk Monastery he 
started in Rangbull, India back in 1976. With 
his teaching, he works to maintain an artistic 
and spiritual tradition.

Recently, the circle of devoted painters has 
been shrinking, and commercial tourist imita­
tions have proliferated. Lama Tsondru said that 
many artisans in India and Nepal have chosen 
to forgo the arduous training process. Some cir­
cumvent the recitation of mantras, the medi­
tation, and the consecration that traditionally 
granted the thangkas their power to bring kar­
mic benefit. Instead, they copy and trace old 
thangkas, often losing the original proportions 
of the deities, as written in the texts. These 
mass-produced thangkas Lama Tsondru sees 
back at home concern him. “They are really 
diminishing or destroying our very precious 
thangka tradition,” he said.

In Lama Tonsdru’s monastery in Rangbull, 
the small staff and thirteen students spend six 
years in training, memorizing the Buddhist 
texts and mantras, the proportions, measure­
ments, and angles with which each deity must 
be drawn, and practicing their painting tech­
nique. Lama Tsondru has exhibited paintings 
in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York. 
By bringing this threatened art form to the 
U.S., he intends to partially fund the monastery 
back home.

Though the paintings his Hamden students 
produce may not be of the same technical qual­
ity as those of his monastery students, he asks 
that his four American students follow tradi­
tional practices. They recite the mantras before 
they begin painting, and they draw the deities 
in their correct proportions. They learn to 
work in a specific order: first the eyes, then the 
face, then the body. It can take years before a 
student is ready to begin drawing on canvas. In 
traditional thangkas, each detail is measured, 
precisely and geometrically. “Without following 
the text, without doing the important propor­
tions and measurements, that thangka is not 
considered like a thangka,” Lama Tsondru said.

Even small errors might invalidate the 
thangka as a religious object, an embodied 
artwork. This sometimes causes stress among 
his Hamden students, who don’t practice their 
technique as often as his students in India. “Ev­
eryone else is doing deities,” Burgess laughs. “I

think Lama Tsondru…doesn’t want me to start 
on a deity and then ruin it.” 
T
o begin the class, Lama Tsondru leads stu­
dents in a  mantra to Manjushri, the deity 
of knowledge and wisdom. Lama Tsondru, sit­
ting cross-legged on the floor, begins to chant 
in a deep voice, and his two students follow 
along, reading softly from a transliterated ver­
sion. Each settles into a spot on his living room 
floor and begins to paint. He kneels next to 
Bobby Banquer, a student who has been study­
ing with him for eight years. Lama Tsondru of­
fers quiet corrections, pointing to small modi­
fications that must be made. Banquer brushes 
her graying bangs away and peers through elec­
tric-blue glasses, carefully tapping her brush to 
the canvas. Banquer, a New Haven local like 
Burgess, started taking classes eight years ago, 
after becoming increasingly interested in Asian 
art through her yoga practice.

Once he finishes correcting Banquer’s small 
error, the lama pulls out a large black art case 
and begins flipping through a file of a student’s 
work. He points out pages filled with pre­
cisely proportioned eyes, ink swirls of clouds 
and folding fabrics, and intricately measured 
sketches of the face of the Buddha, the body 
of the Buddha, the bodies of other deities, each 
measured in its precise geometric proportions. 
But some, he says, are not quite right. “This 
face is not so good,” he says, putting two draw-
ings of Tara, a female deity revered for compas­
sion and action, side by side. I can barely tell 
the difference between the two—the eyes of 
one deity are slightly more narrow, the breasts 
more round, the waist more tilted—but Lama 
Tsondru knows which one is correct. “This 
one,” he says, pointing to the other. “This one 
is better, improved.” 

Out of Lama Tsondru’s four regular stu­
dents in Hamden, three are Buddhist. Each 
student aside from Banquer heard about the 
center through word of mouth and became 
intrigued by the merging of spiritual and ar­
tistic practices. Burgess and Sue MacClain, 
another student, had both studied art prior to 
Lama Tsondru’s classes. Initially, they were at­
tracted to the aesthetics of the thangkas, but 
continued their study for the art’s spiritual as­
pect. “The actual time spent working on it is 
very meditative,” said MacClain, who has been 
studying thangka painting with Lama Tsondru 
for almost three years. “It’s a way to become re­
ally mindful about what you’re doing. You have 
to be really present, really look, really see, in 
order to be so precise about it.”

The attention to detail and tradition re­
quired to paint thangkas aligns the practice 
with other elements of Buddhism. In 2007, 
Lama Tsondru formally founded his own cen­
ter for Buddhist teaching, called the Thupten 
Ling Dharma Center. While there are just four 
students who regularly attend Lama Tsondru’s 
thangka painting classes, there are now about 
twenty members of the sangha, the Buddhist 
term for community of practice. Aside from 
Lama Tsondru’s wife and children, the major­

ity of the sangha members are 
Americans, some of whom have 
been practicing Buddhism for 
decades, and others who only 
recently took their commitment 
vows. Lama Tonsdru does not 
require his thangka painting stu­
dents to join the sangha.

Burgess, who is neither a 
member of the sangha nor a fully 
practicing Buddhist, values the 
meditative elements of the dis­
ciplined adherence to the rules 
of thangka painting. “This is 
my church,” she tells me, refer­
ring to the process of painting. 
She has an altar at home that is 
“partially Buddhist” though mix­
ing and matching from different 
religions can get complicated, 
Burgess believes that if she fol­
lows the rules that Lama Tson­
dru has laid out for her, even her 
thangka can create good karma. 
“If it’s done correctly and with 
the right attitude, it has benefit 
for whoever looks at it.” 

L
ama Tsondru’s class is much 
more than a Sunday hobby; 
the students who come in who 
listen to his methodical instruc­
tions enter a tradition, even 
while they adapt it to their New 
Haven routines. The paintings 
that hang in their homes might 
not be as perfect as those pro­
duced in Rangbull, but even as 
the practice has crossed over­
seas, the artisans back in the 
monastery continue their work. 
And in Hamden, the students 
and those who observe their art­
work all benefit from the deities 
conjured on canvas.

Trying to Transcend
“A
im, aim, aim.”  I’m sitting cross-legged on 
the floor of my dorm room, eyes closed, 
chanting this word over and over in my head. 
I’m trying to practice Transcendental Medita­
tion, which, among meditators, is known for be­
ing especially simple. But it doesn’t feel simple. 
Am I breathing correctly? Is my posture right? 
How will I know if I’m meditating? I worry that 
worrying about the best way to meditate is get­
ting in the way of meditating, which is exactly 
the kind of paralyzing overanalyzing that caused 
me to consider meditating to begin with.  

I shouldn’t have done this alone, I think. In 
theory, I’m not supposed to. Official Transcen­
dental Meditation (TM) practice begins with a 
lengthy interview with a certified TM teacher. 
The teacher assigns the meditator a personal 
word, or mantra. Next, the meditator attends 
an introductory lecture and four classes. The 
total cost: $960.  

I don’t have that kind of cash, so I turned 
to the Internet to soothe my soul. I found a 
website called www.tm.org, which calls itself 
the “Official Website” of TM. There, I found 
a chart of personalized mantras determined by 
age and gender.  For men aged 35–40, the man­
tra is “shring,” for women, it’s “shrim.” But for 
me—a woman between 15 and 30—it’s “aim.”

I’ve been feeling especially anxious lately, 
full of a nervous, manic energy that makes it 
hard to concentrate. My hands shake, and I 
wake in the middle of the night with the after-
images of vivid dreams. My hope is that experi­
menting with meditation could bring me some 
sense of calm and a more restful mind. I’ve 
decided to try TM because of its simplicity: as 
far as I can tell, it’s meditation for dummies, a 
minimalist practice. All I have to do is sit for 
twenty minutes twice a day silently repeating a 
single word. TM practitioners claim that it of­
fers significant benefits, such as unity of being, 
heightened awareness, and self-control. That’s 
certainly appealing. What’s more, TM stresses 
that it’s not a religion. It doesn’t ask practitio­
ners to change the structure of their lives in any 
significant way. No work. Just the word.

TM began in the late 1950s as the brain­
child of Indian spiritual figure Maharishi Ma­
hesh Yogi. By the 1960s, Yogi was serving as the 
spiritual advisor to the Beatles. Despite its un­
conventionality, TM has lasted into the twenty-
first century largely because it has made itself 
into an institution—building schools, training 
teachers, and perfecting its publicity tactics. I’m 
suspicious of this system. But I’m also intrigued 
by the way TM instructors have taken a solitary, 
silent practice and turned it into something col­
lective—an experience that is both private and, 
because of the formal TM training, shared by 
countless others. I read dozens of online testi­
monials, and find myself overwhelmed. They all 
use the same words: “stillness,” “unity,” “rest.” 
The rhetoric has a certain seductive, chatty 
quality; it combines subjective experience and 
supposedly objective science, and it constantly 
treads the line between earnest enthusiasm and 
syrupy kitsch.  

I’m fascinated by the sheer mass of per­
sonal success stories. Celebrities are particu­
larly enthusiastic. Russell Brand, a comedian, 
former heroin addict, and ex-husband of Katy 
Perry, gives a testimonial on the website for the

A shower for my brain sounds nice. So does 
reduced cortisol (“the stress hormone”), in­
creased self-control, lower risk of heart attack 
and stroke, and a greater sense of companion­
ship with my fellow human beings. According 
to what I read online, TM can make miracles 
happen. It could help me achieve everything 
from self-actualization to world peace: “the 
Maharishi effect,” part quantum physics and 
part social theory, claims that the “unified field 
of consciousness,” which TM creates, can calm 
violent communities. If one percent of the pop­
ulation in any given area practices TM, crime 
rates will, supposedly, fall dramatically.

This seems fuzzy and far-fetched, and I dis­
like how enlightenment has been turned into 
a commodity. But I’m willing to give TM a try. 
The TM center closest to me is in Hamden, 
a few bus stops up Whitney Avenue. It is run 
by Richard and Gail Dalby, a friendly, middle-
aged pair who offer introductory lectures on 
Wednesday nights and more advanced classes 
every couple of weeks. They insist that the $960 
fee is not exclusive, but actually democratiz­
ing: that money funds TM centers around the 
globe. TM, Gail Dolby tells me, “is a worldwide 
phenomenon; an established organization with 
millions of practitioners.” Part of what they’re 
selling is a connection to a larger network, but 
they create the network by selling you the con­
cept of the network. This is how any successful 
large organization—from church to corpora­
tion—works.

But this collective experience also brings 
individual benefits. Judson Brewer, a Yale pro­
fessor whose research is largely focused on the 
neuroscience of meditation, confirms that this 
kind of spiritual experience causes observable 
changes in the brain. At Yale, Dr. Brewer ran 
studies using functional MRI technology to 
map what goes on in the someone’s mind while 
he or she is in a meditative state. What Russell 
Brand can describe only vaguely, Brewer can il­
lustrate via color-coded graphs and articulate in 
scientific language. In layman’s terms, the area 


14
of my brain associated with anxiety, depression, 
cravings, and lying, was probably deactivated 
while I meditated. This happens in the brains 
of novices and experienced meditators alike. 
“After a few tries,” he says, “there was very little 
difference in brain function between those who 
had just started and those who had been medi­
tating for years.” 

Brewer himself is a longtime meditator, fol­
lowing a Buddhist breath-based system that he 
was introduced to in college. He undertakes 
scientific study of meditation, he tells me, be­
cause, “cynically speaking, science is the new 
religion of the West. If we can develop a science 
of meditation, we can develop some faith for 
people who wouldn’t otherwise be open to it.”  
Like Richard and Gail Dalby, he sees the poten­
tial for creating institutions to help make an in­
dividual practice communal; in 2012, he helped 
start a Yale meditation group, YMindful, that 
still meets twice a week.  

Meditation, advocates say, can be useful 
in confronting many of life’s difficulties. New 
Haven’s New Horizons High School—an al­
ternative school for students with academic 
or behavioral difficulties—has introduced its 
students to meditation. Maureen Bransfield, 
the school’s principal, says that the techniques 
helps students “calm down, be more aware of 
their emotions.” Support systems that teach 
and encourage meditation, Brewer believes, 
can also improve the lives of those suffering 
from addiction and chronic pain. When he 
ran the Yale Therapeutic Neuroscience Clinic, 
he worked with recovering smokers who used 
meditation and mindfulness to fight nicotine 
cravings. 

“It doesn’t matter what type of meditation 
you do,” he says. “Any type of mindfulness or 
breath-awareness will help focus the mind away 
from destructive self-referential processes.” 
Large institutions like the TM machine aren’t 
necessary; small, grassroots groups like YMind­
ful can also help people achieve the same re­
sults.

A few minutes into one of my medita­
tion sessions, my thoughts slowly become less 
frantic, less self-aware. There’s a subtle shift, a 
detachment. Instead of dwelling on the day’s 
anxieties, I begin to passively observe my emo­
tions. I drift in and out of thinking about “aim,” 
but focusing even a small part of my brain on 
this three-letter pattern keeps me from being 
obsessed with self-reflection. I begin to feel my 
breath. I begin to incorporate that physical sen­
sation into the progress of my thoughts.  

Once, I have a powerful urge to open my 
eyes and check the timer on my phone. I think 
about how my back and neck hurt, the floor is 
uncomfortable, and my hands are sweaty. What 
if I forgot to set the timer?  I am just about to 
quit when it occurs to me that I don’t have to. 
What else would I do? I let the boredom fill 
me. I consider it from all angles. The moment 
passes. 

Eventually, I breathe deeper and slower. 
The silent chant of “aim” has aligned itself with 
the rhythm of my breath. I feel the breath pull­
ing me, starting lower in my stomach, expand­
ing my diaphragm, and traveling up my chest. 
When I exhale, I feel air rolling out of me, my 
chest deflating, my shoulders rolling backward. 
I am very still. My arms and head feel simul­
taneously very heavy and very light. For a mo­
ment, I almost feel the blood moving through 
my body. I think, “Is this meditating? Am I 
meditating now?” The moment passes. I open 
my eyes and reach to turn off the timer, with 
hands a little less shaky, mind a little quieter.

Behind Bars
A Jamaican immigrant becomes the voice 
of some detained by the Department of 
Homeland Security
by Noah Remnick
O
n a cool November evening in 2012, Mark 
Reid finished his final supper as Inmate 
Number 141754. After three years at the Brook­
lyn Correctional Institution in Connecticut, 
Reid was scheduled for release the following 
morning. The past three years had been some 
of the most trying of his life, but as he leafed 
through the small trove of letters and photo­
graphs beside his bed, the 48-year-old Reid was 
reminded of all that he had to look forward to.

Thanksgiving was just about a week away, 
and after all the time he had spent in a jail cell, 
he felt especially thankful for the chance to sit 
down to dinner with his family. He was the fa­
ther of two children, a son who planned to en­
list in the Navy, and a daughter in high school. 
He had led the comfortable life of a real estate 
broker, with a modest salary and a sense of sta­
bility. His most recent conviction, for the sale 
of narcotics and burglary in the third degree, 
had taken that away.

R
eid’s release from prison should have been 
a fresh start, a classic American story of 
new beginnings. During his three-year incarcer­
ation, Reid’s attitude toward life changed. He 
sought out spiritual and psychological counsel­
ing. He woke up at four o’clock each morning 
to study for a paralegal certification. He imag­
ined a better future for himself and his family.

But as Reid was packing, a prison official 
cut short his second chance. He would not be 
heading home the next morning, the official 
told him. Instead, he would be taken into cus­
tody by Immigration and Customs Enforce­
ment (ICE), a division of the Department of 
Homeland Security, and held in a detention fa­
cility. Just as he was about to leave the criminal 
justice system, Reid was forced into another of 
the nation’s most controversial institutions: the 
immigration detention system.

Reid came to the United States at 14 to 
reunite with his mother, who had left Jamaica 
years earlier to send money back home to her 
family. Years later, an Army recruiter promised 
Reid that time spent in the reserves would 
grant him citizenship. He did not know he had 
to apply. Nor did he know that if he broke the 
law, his green card could be revoked. 

A
t the Franklin County Jail in Greenfield, 
Massachusetts, Reid found that he was 
one of nearly one hundred noncitizens who 
had been detained after some interaction with 
a government agency. Many, like Reid, had been 
charged with violating the terms of their visas 
or green cards by breaking the law. 

Every year, more than 400,000 non-citizen 
detainees are locked up in one of the 250 immi­
gration detention centers in the United States. 
In 2012, ICE detained a record 478,000 people, 
according to the Department of Homeland 
Security. The vast majority of them were from 
Latin American countries, with nearly seventy 
percent coming from Mexico alone. Only 0.4 
percent of those held were from Jamaica, Reid’s 
country of birth. 

Franklin, where Reid was confined, is con­
tracted to house detainees for ICE. Homeland 
Security’s so-called “bed mandate” requires

Every year, more than 400,000 
non-citizen detainees are 
locked up in one of the 250
immigration detention centers 
in the United States.


ICE to fill an average of 34,000 beds in deten­
tion centers each day. The imprisoned include 
victims of torture, asylum seekers, families with 
young children, veterans, mentally and physi­
cally disabled people, and lawful permanent 
residents, like Reid, who face deportation be­
cause of criminal convictions. The system 
comes at a hefty price, costing taxpayers $122 to 
$164 to hold a detainee each day, adding up to 
$2 billion a year.

Immigration lawyers estimate that doz­
ens of the detainees are men and women 
who believed that they were made U.S. citi­
zens simply by serving in the U.S. military. 
Like Reid, they failed to grasp that citizen­
ship was not automatically conferred. Their 
numbers may be small, but their situations are 
particularly distressing since these men and 
women risked their lives for a country now 
pressing to expel them.

Mark Reid was not giv­
en a chance to tell a judge or 
hearing officer that he had 
served in the military for six 
years and that the recruiter 
promised he would receive 
his citizenship in return. He 
didn’t have a chance to talk 
about how he had worked 
to improve himself during 
his recent time in jail. He never had the chance 
to tell an official that he had a place to live and 
a family ready to help him back in New Haven 
because, like many noncitizen detainees, Reid 
was denied an individual bond hearing. This 
would have allowed him to plead for the oppor­
tunity to live in the community while his depor­
tation case was adjudicated. 

Noncitizen detainees are first brought be­
fore a judge, and there an official declares that 
the government has reason to deport them. 
They are then incarcerated until their cases are 
heard and their immigration status finalized. At 
that point, they are either deported or allowed 
to return to their homes in the U.S. Often they 
are locked up for months, even years, until they 
get any such resolution. This practice defies pre­
vious judicial decisions, which found that such 
lengthy pre-trial confinements violate both the 
Immigration and Naturalization Act and the 
Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of 
the U.S., both of which protect the defendant’s 
right to challenge their detention and prohibit 
the government from arbitrarily incarcerating 
them. Prior court cases have set the limit for 
a “reasonable” length of detention without a 
bond hearing at six months.

Immigration officials have little to say on 
the matter. Daniel Modricker, a spokesman for 
the Department of Homeland Security, released 
this statement: “While we cannot comment on 
ongoing litigation, ICE is committed to smart, 
effective immigration enforcement that focuses 
first on convicted criminal aliens, and those ap­
prehended at the border while attempting to 
unlawfully enter the United States.”

But detaining people so excessively is dis­
proportionate to the offense, insisted Nicole 
Hallett, a clinical teach­
ing fellow at the Yale Law 
School who specializes in 
immigration law. She ex­
pressed outrage at the cur­
rent state of detention. 
“You can’t just detain 
people indefinitely,” Hallett 
told me. “It’s not punish­
ment like in prison—it’s im­
migration detention. These 
people have already served their time, so this 
is civil detention—not unlike Guantanamo.” Of 
course, Guantanamo has garnered a decade of 
media attention. Immigration detention issues, 
though, remain in the shadows. 


Long before he ever saw the inside of a jail 
cell, Mark Reid was an aimless 20-year-old 
embarking upon his future in America. It was 
1984, and he had left his troubled childhood in 
Kingston behind several years earlier. He had 
moved to town to town, before moving to New 
Haven to work for his uncle’s construction 
business. 

While he was accompanying his cousin to a 
meeting about formalizing his cousin’s citizen­
ship papers, Reid met an Army recruiter who 
told him about the benefits of military service: 
honor, discipline, and, most importantly, the 
guarantee of United States citizenship. A few 
months later, Reid signed up for the Army Re­
serves. Just before leaving for boot camp, Reid 
said that he called his recruiter to ensure that 
everything was in order with his citizenship.

“You’ll be taken care of,” he recalls the re­
cruiter telling him.

Upon returning from boot camp in Spring­
field, Massachusetts, later that year, he began 
to stray. He started hanging out with a few new 
friends from outside of his church circle.

“They had the new cars, the new sneak­
ers. They were the most popular people in the 
street and I wanted to be a part of that,” Reid 
explained. He was brought up in a family of de­
vout Seventh Day Adventists, and the world of 
drugs was entirely new to him.

Reid quickly discovered that drugs could 
fund the life he envied. Soon enough, he was 
passing his time on the streets, selling and even­
tually using a variety of narcotics. He still spent 
some weekends in Springfield, training with 
the reserves. By the time he was honorably dis­
charged in 1990, he had already had several con­
frontations with the police.


Reid’s first encounter with the law came in 
1986. Still a fresh face on the corner, he 
wanted to establish his street credentials. That 
meant accumulating an arrest record. One day, 
his pockets filled with drugs, Reid intentionally 
circled a police cruiser until he was stopped and 
searched. After discovering that Reid had no 
prior arrests, the officer confiscated the drugs 
and released Reid with a warning. But Reid 
was determined to get arrested, and before 
long, he landed in jail. His sixty-day sentence 
would be the first of several over the course of 
the next two decades, mostly for various minor 
drug offenses. Reid’s life was in turmoil, but 
he barely noticed, he told me. In his world, it 
seemed normal.

“During that time, being incarcerated was 
just another part of being in the streets,” he 
said. “You’d know the majority of people locked 
up. There was nothing telling you that things 
needed to change. I went in and out with the 
same mentality.”

By the time he was due to be released from 
his most recent sentence, in November 2012, 
immigration officials had determined that it 
was too late to change. ICE had decided that 
Reid, a veteran and legal permanent resident 
with no history of terrorist activity, was a “dan­
gerous criminal actor,” and that he should be 
deported.

Reid is among the growing number of de­
tainees who have been caught up under a pro­
gram called “Secure Communities.” Established 
in 2008, Secure Communities requires the FBI 
to share its database of prisoner fingerprints 
with immigration authorities. If ICE officials 
find a match with someone who is in the coun­
try illegally, they can ask local prisons to detain 
them. According to ICE, the program priori­
tizes the deportation proceedings of the most 
“dangerous criminal aliens,” those who pose 
public safety risks. This program was created 
by ICE, rather than Congress; as a result, ICE 
has complete discretion over who is detained. 
Communities, politicians, and academics have 
objected to the program’s premise and scope, 
but they have little power to make changes. 
One of the most vocal local critics of Secure 
Communities is Michael Wishnie, a professor 
at the Yale Law School. “ICE has not backed 
down on Secure Communities,” Wishnie told 
me. “They’ve managed to force it on the entire 
country over the objections of mayors and 
local leaders. They promised that they’d only 
go after violent offenders, but all of the data 
suggest the opposite. The program is sweeping 
up exactly the people [ICE says] are not high-
level targets.” 

Wishnie also warned that Secure Commu­
nities leads to ineffective policing: fear of de­
portation erodes trust between local police and 
New Haven’s immigrant community. 

Detainees face more than just the erosion 
of their constitutional rights. Several newspa­
pers and community organizations have re­
leased reports describing human rights abuses 
in immigration detention centers, from inad­
equate medical attention to meager meals to 
sexual abuse. For Reid, the physical conditions 
in the detention center were humane, but he 
said that the experience was emotionally gru­
eling. Each day, he found himself surrounded 

by throngs of people enduring extraordinary 
psychological stress as they faced possible de­
portation at any time. They were also coping 
with separation from their families, as well as 
financial ruin. Reid knew several people who at­
tempted suicide. He even contemplated taking 
his own life as he struggled to handle the pros­
pect of returning to Jamaica.

“Families 
were 
separated, 
children 
constantly crying, people yelling, screaming, 
worrying,” Reid said. “It was a devastating 
environment.”

Reid’s future looked bleak, but a few New 
Haven organizations heard about his case and 
saw in him symbolic power as a plaintiff. For de­
cades, savvy lawyers have gone to great lengths 
to find complainants who could serve as effec­
tive figureheads for their causes, from Rosa 
Parks to Edie Windsor. In this case, Reid fit the 
bill. He was a veteran, a property owner, and 
a father with strong community ties. He had 
made bad choices, but he had changed for the 
better. Students from Yale Law School’s Veter­
ans’ Legal Services Clinic were among the first 
to take note, and the provided Reid with initial 
support and advising. They were then joined by 
fellow Yale law students from the Worker and 
Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic (WIRAC). 
Both groups are part of the Jerome N. Frank 
Legal Services Organization, which allows law 
students to represent local clients and gain 
courtroom experience under the guidance of 
professors. 

On July 1, 2013, after Reid had been held in 
detention for nearly eight months without the 
opportunity to argue for his release on bond, 
the Yale law students helped Reid file a writ 
of habeas corpus, which required that he be 
brought to court. Guards shackled his hands, 
waist, and feet when he appeared at hearings—
another violation of his constitutional rights, 
according to his lawyers.

Reid also filed a class action lawsuit in fed­
eral court. The lawsuit argued that the govern­
ment unlawfully trapped not only him and oth­
er noncitizens in the ICE system for too long 
without allowing the bond hearing they were 
legally entitled to. Six months later, in Janu-

ary of 2014, Judge Michael Ponsor first ruled 
in Reid’s favor. Ponsor found that the govern­
ment had attempted to defend its detention 
practice based on a “dubious interpretation” of 
immigration law and had offered “irrelevant” 
and “flawed” arguments. A month later, Judge 
Ponsor ruled that Reid was not alone, but that 
he was indeed one in a “class” of people suffer­
ing similar injustice, who were all entitled to file 
a class action lawsuit. Judge Ponsor’s ruling re­
lates only to detainees in Massachusetts, where 
ICE confines most noncitizens from Connecti­
cut slated for deportation, but immigration ac­
tivists around the country are looking to this 
case as a bellwether for similar situations in 
other jurisdictions.

“Every story is unique, but people don’t 
realize just how common this is and how dis­
ruptive it can be for people in the community,” 
said Conchita Cruz, a Yale law student who is 
part of the WIRAC team. Deportation may be 
a civil offense, but it feels like criminal punish­
ment for all parties involved.

A
fter Judge Ponsor’s ruling, ICE was forced 
to grant Reid a bond hearing. On Febru­
ary 3, 2014, a full sixteen months after Reid 
had been taken into custody by ICE, students 
from WIRAC represented him at the hearing. 
He was granted release on $25,000 bond until 
his case is resolved. He told his story in an op-
ed in The Hartford Courant, and the publicity 
helped him raise the $25,000 he needed for the 
bond and his release. On February 25, he was 
released from Franklin. His lawyers from Yale 
“They promised that they’d 
only go after violent offenders, but 
all of the data suggest the 
opposite.” 
Michael Wishnie, 
Yale Law School Professor
drove to the jail to embrace him as he walked 
out of the prison gates. Then, they brought 
him home.

As he waits for resolution of his case, Mark 
Reid recognizes that he is fortunate compared 
to most noncitizens facing potential deporta­
tion. Eighty-four percent of people in immi­
gration detention lack legal representation—a 
particular problem for noncitizens, who often 
speak little English, and cannot understand the 
charges and proceedings against them. Reid, 
again at home in New Haven, spends his days 
visiting with friends and family and working 
with his lawyers. Since his release, he has spo­
ken on behalf of other detainees in immigra­
tion court. He is currently working to receive 
proper certification to represent detainees in 
an official capacity.

Thousands of other noncitizens are still 
held in detention centers around the country. 
Some detainees now look to Reid as the face of 
a class action suit that they hope might soon 
bring them some relief. But the legal battle will 
have to intensify for long-term results. “In the 
vacuum of federal action,” Wishnie said, “local 
leaders have had to do it, but eventually it’s go­
ing to have to happen on a federal level.”

e pull into the park­
ing lot with a trunk 
full of guns. I have arrived 
at the Branford Gun Club 
along with Lenny Benedetto 
and his wife Virginia. Both 
are gun enthusiasts and ac­
tive in the anti-gun control 
lobby. Lenny is the vice pres­
ident of the Connecticut 
Citizens’ Defense League 
(CCDL), and his wife is the 
organization’s 
technology 
coordinator. They are out to 
show me that neither guns 
nor their owners are intrin­
sically scary, and today, they 
are going to teach me how 
to shoot. I have never shot 
a gun in my life, and I am 
jittery as we unload safety 
equipment and firearms.

But before I pick up 
a gun, I need to use the 
bathroom. I ask where I can 
do that. 

A tall man with long 
dark hair—one of the cou­
ple’s friends chatting with us 
in the parking lot—crosses 
his arms and squints down 
at me, suddenly even taller. 
I was introduced to him as 
a reporter from Yale, and he 
seems reluctant to tell me 
where the bathroom is. 
“I’m gonna need to read 
the article first,” he says. 
“Which side are you on?”

I interview asks some 
form of this question. They 
all want to know where 
I stand, because many of 
them believe the media have 
heaped praise on SB-1160—
the Connecticut General 
Assembly’s response to the

They think I am that media.

I would take their words out 
of context and turn them

general—as hopelessly ignorant and unfit to 
contribute to the dialogue because they, like 
me, have never even held a gun. The terms 
“grabber” (as in “gun grabber”) and “libtard” get 
tossed around a lot in reference to Democratic 
politicians and their supporters by members 
of CTGunTalk, an online forum where state 
gun owners discuss everything from politics to 
shooting competitions. If some of the forum 
posts confirm liberals’ stereotypes of gun own­
ers, they also reveal how genuinely and deeply 
the state’s gun owners believe that they are un­
der attack by reporters, by the legislature, and 
by their own friends and acquaintances who 
just don’t get it. 

On the other side, President Obama, 
Connecticut’s Governor Dan Malloy, and 
gun control activists across the nation have 
celebrated SB-1160, which gave Connecticut 
some of the strictest gun laws in the country. 
Signed into law last April, the legislation expands 
the ban on assault weapons to include dozens 
of additional models, tightly restricts the use 
of magazines (ammunition containers) that can 
hold more than ten bullets, and requires owners 
of such weapons and magazines to register 
them with the state. It requires background 
checks for all transfers of guns between owners, 
rather than only for purchases from gun shops. 
It also requires a permit to purchase long guns, 
which are braced against the shoulder. The 
law is jargon-laden and confusing in places, 
but clear in its intent. It exists to reduce the 
availability of the semi-automatic assault 
weapons often used in headline-grabbing mass 
murders: Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, 
and Sandy Hook. SB-1160’s supporters see the 
law as a model that other states should follow. 
But to the Benedettos and other gun owners 
who support CCDL, SB-1160 encroaches on 
the rights they hold dear.

It is too early to tell if the law will work. 
Exact figures are hard to come by, but the Na­
tional Shooting Sports Foundation estimates 
that there are 300,000 assault weapons in the 
state. Only fifty thousand were registered as 
of mid-March, according to Lieutenant Paul 
Vance, spokesman for Connecticut’s Depart­
ment of Emergency Services and Public Pro­
tection (DESPP), which is handling the reg­
istration. Now that the registration deadline 
of January 1, 2014 has passed, there is no way 
for owners of illegal guns to comply with the 
law unless they surrender their weapons. This 
means that there are hundreds of thousands of 
newly illegal firearms all over Connecticut. And, 
due to a loophole that co-sponsor Senator Don 
Williams says was completely unintentional but 
unlikely to be closed with additional legislation, 
no one is required to register assault weapons 
manufactured before 1993, when Connecticut 
enacted its first and more limited ban on assault 
weapons. This also means that plenty of older, 
powerful weapons similar to those used in mass 
shootings can still be legally bought and sold in 
Connecticut without registration. 

“Every time the politicians squawk, I go 
buy more,” the long-haired bathroom guardian 
declares shortly after we arrived at the range. 
“You gotta go buy more,” agrees Lenny 
Benedetto. It’s considered a patriotic duty 
to flout the spirit of the law. Many CCDL 
members view SB-1160 as a violation of the 
Second Amendment. Chris and Cheryl Lemos, 
CCDL’s membership coordinator and blogger, 
call this amendment “the right that guarantees 
all other rights.”

When I ask them if there is any gun control 
measure they support, they laugh.
“Well, I don’t think people should have gre­
nade launchers,” Cheryl Lemos says.

Encroaching on gun ownership rights, 
CCDL members believe, could lead to the ero­
sion of one right after the other, and they think 
gun control supporters are blind to this fact.
“I’m sure the folks at Yale would be having 
all kinds of conniptions if they took out the 
First Amendment,” Cheryl Lemos says. 

Reverence for the Second Amendment 
leads these groups distrust America’s govern­
ment. New Haven resident Carl Roehrich, 
who brought a group of novice shooters from

want me or any Connecticut citizen to have 
them,” Roehrich says. 

Roehrich believes that one day—perhaps 
not in his lifetime, but not in the far-off future, 
either—the American people will be forced 
revolt against their government, if the govern­
ment does not first turn its guns against the 
people. When that happens, Roehrich is under 
no illusion that his assault rifles could effectively 
counter the most powerful and technologically 
advanced military in the world. Roehrich does 
not want to risk ceding his guns to the state, 
and he believes registering guns heightens the 
likelihood of eventual seizure. 

Despite suspicion that registration could 
lead to confiscation, the Benedettos and all oth­
er CCDL executive board members registered 
their guns in compliance with SB-1160 to avoid 
attracting negative attention 
to their organization. While 
reluctantly adhering to the 
law’s requirements, they also 
publicly and strenuously op­
posed it. The CCDL board 
filed a lawsuit, which was 
dismissed by a federal judge 
in January but which they 
hope will go all the way to 
the Supreme Court. They 
have endorsed two Republican gubernatorial 
candidates, Joe Visconti and Martha Dean, who 
are “pro-Second Amendment.” They have held 
events like a March “Open-Carry Brunch” at 
Bagel King of Bridgeport, at which gun owners 
were encouraged to proudly carry their weap­
ons. On April 5, a year and a day after the pas­
sage of SB-1160, they held a rally outside the 
capitol building in Hartford, drawing thousands 
from all over the Northeast. CCDL’s online 
post to its members before the rally presented 
these armed Americans as victims of an oppres­
sive state, persecuted but proud, safe only in 
numbers: “We need every person there to make 
our voices heard.”  

T
he gun issue is political, but a gun itself is 
a machine. In theory, one should be able to 
regard guns apolitically, to utilize them without 
wading into the turgid partisan whirlpool sur­
rounding them, to view them apart from the 
conflicting visions of America. Particularly at 
the Branford Gun Club, where members enjoy 
target practice and trap shooting while eating 
donuts together, I expect guns will be discussed 
primarily as a hobby. But every interaction with 
a gun presents an opportunity to reflect on an 
element of the law. 

The Benedettos are quick to emphasize 
that guns can be used safely. When he picks me 
up on Chapel Street that morning, Lenny Bene­
detto assures me that his SUV is “loaded up 
with guns.” Of course, the guns are not loaded. 
He laughs his distinctive belly laugh at the ab­
surdity of his own tough-guy talk. It is a twenty-
minute drive to the club. After we arrive, the 
Benedettos start taking out “eyes and ears—
glasses to improve visibility and provide ocular 
protection, and oversized 
earmuffish contraptions to 
muffle the sound of gun­
shots. They give me a pair 
of yellow glasses and a set 
of red earmuffs. I look like 
an army recruit undergoing 
basic training sponsored by 
McDonald’s.

We go inside the range, 
a squat building where sev­
eral people stand in a line to shoot at not-so-
distant targets. As he opens the first case and 
pulls out a .22 caliber Firestorm pistol, Lenny 
Benedetto tells me the first rule of guns: “Nev­
er point a gun at something you don’t want to 
destroy.” The second rule: never put your fin­
ger on the trigger until you’re ready to shoot. 
The third: always assume the gun is loaded. 
The implicit political point Benedetto is try­
ing to make is that people who do bad things 
with guns are unlike the Benedettos and their 
friends and acquaintances, who ought not be 
punished for the sins of those who refuse to re­
spect and understand their weapons.  

As Lenny instructs me in basic gun safety, 
Virginia Benedetto, a soft-spoken Tennessee 
native with impressive aim, shoots a round with 
the Firestorm. The Benedettos selected this 
gun, which Virginia says she hasn’t shot in years, 
specifically for my instruction: it’s small, rela­
Lenny Benedetto tells me 
the first rule of guns: “Never 
point a gun at something 
you don’t want to destroy.”

tively harmless looking, decorated with a pink 
camouflage plastic covering near the handle, 
and can no longer be legally bought or sold in 
the state of Connecticut. 
When it’s my turn to handle the Firestorm, 
loading the magazine—a surprisingly difficult 
task that requires overcoming my fear that the 
gun will explode in my hand if I am too force­
ful—calls to mind SB-1160’s ban on the sale of 
magazines that can hold more than ten bullets. 
The Benedettos are concerned that many peo­
ple who carry guns for self-defense on a regular 
basis do not know that their magazines, which 
often hold seventeen bullets, can no longer be 
filled to capacity except at home and inside gun 
ranges. All high-capacity magazines must be 
completely empty unless they are inside a gun, 
and the Benedettos can imagine a police officer 
with a hatred for guns slipping a bullet inside 
an empty magazine to incriminate a law-abiding 
gun owner. They also don’t buy the argument 
that it was generous of the legislature to allow 
gun owners to keep their high-capacity maga­
zines instead of surrendering them to the state, 
and they think the politicians will keep pushing 
for more regulation. 
“They are, I believe, trying to wipe out the 
next generation with this law,” Lenny Benedet­
to says, lamenting the fact that nobody in the 
future will be able to own high-capacity maga­
zines and newly banned guns. “They are crush­
ing the next generation. It’s incremental. They 
nibble away a little at a time.” 

L
ast spring, the Benedettos joined other gun 
owners in testifying against SB-1160 before 
members of the state legislature. Gun control 
bills had not made it to the General Assembly’s 
floor since 1993, but things had changed. The 
Benedettos weren’t surprised when their efforts 
failed. Twenty-eight people, including twenty 
children too young to be named in the matter-
of-fact autopsy reports released by the state, lay 
dead in the small, affluent community of New­
town. Twenty-six died of wounds inflicted by 
a young man armed with a Bushmaster XM15-
E2S semi-automatic rifle legally purchased by 
his mother. She herself had been killed with a 
.22 caliber Savage MK II-F rifle. He ended his 
own life with a Glock 20SF pistol. 
On the afternoon of the shooting on De­
cember 14, 2012, the CCDL issued a press re­
lease expressing grief and horror at the mas­
sacre, acknowledging that the discussion had 
already turned to gun control, and reminding 
everyone that aberrations like Newtown have 
nothing to do with organizations like theirs.
“There have been many statements con­
demning firearms and gun owners as a result 
of this tragedy,” CCDL president Scott Wilson 
said in the press release. “This was an act of de­
ranged behavior from a mentally ill individual, 
not of decent and law abiding people that own 
guns and respect life.” 
The next day, Don Williams, president pro 
tempore of the state Senate, spoke with Senate 
minority leader and current gubernatorial can­
didate John McKinney, who represents New­
town. They agreed to create a special bipartisan 
process to craft the legislative response to the 
tragedy. Working with leaders from both par­
ties, Williams and McKinney established three 
bipartisan task forces. One task force addressed 
school security, another focused on mental 
health, and the third dealt with guns. Each task 
force comprised eight Democrats and eight Re­
publicans, and each met for several weeks of 
hearings and debate. 
As this planning took place, the CCDL con­
demned the gun control measures they foresaw. 
They issued another press release and published 
a message to members on their blog, exhorting 
gun owners to mobilize at the capitol when the 
time came. On January 28, 2013, at the largest 
of the task forces’ public hearings, hundreds 
of gun owners testified from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 
Several weeks later, the gun task force approved 
the new restrictions and an eighty-seven-page 
bill moved to the General Assembly. Because 
the bill was emergency certified—a distinction 
usually granted to measures responding to natu­
ral disasters or facing a tight deadline—SB-1160 
went directly to a floor vote instead of passing 
through standing committees. It passed the 
Senate with 26-10 and the House of Represen­
tatives 105-44. Gov. Malloy signed the bill into 
law on April 4.
Yet the Benedettos and many other gun ad­
vocates who testified are convinced that their 
concerns were not properly considered in part 
because the vote took place just a few hours af­
ter the legislature received the bill. 
“There was no deliberation,” says John 
Sturmer, the owner of JJ Firearms Training, 
who testified at the capitol hearing. “There was 
dictation.”
Scott Bennett, who also testified, claims 
that the language of the bill largely came from 
gun control advocacy groups such as the Brady 
Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. “What 
process?” Bennett says. “This stuff was pre-
written and they just put it all together and 
rammed it through.”


T
oni Boucher, Sturmer’s state senator, was 
the Republican co-chair of the school se­
curity committee. She called the entire process 
“tense and contentious.” But Boucher believes 
that people on both sides of the aisle made seri­
ous compromises. When the negotiations start­
ed, some Democratic legislators supported ban­
ning all magazines that could hold more than a 
single bullet. Republican involvement, Boucher 
says, prevented the most restrictive laws from 
being passed. 
“It was remarkable that on issues that 
sometimes can be so divisive in our national 
politics, we were able to have all four leaders of 
both parties co-sponsor and support that legis­
lation,” Don Williams says. 
Sturmer and Bennett agree that the effort 
was bipartisan, and do not reserve their anger 
for Democrats alone. Both recognize that most 
Democrats in the legislature support gun control 
more than their Republican counterparts. Both 
feel betrayed by the Republican leadership 

that allowed Democrats to claim Republican 
support for their proposals. Neither buys the 
claim, advanced by Republicans like Boucher 
and McKinney, that Republican presence at the 
negotiating table improved the outcome for gun 
owners. In fact, Sturmer wishes Republicans had 
allowed Democrats to pass a law authorizing 
confiscation of assault weapons, which would 
have been easier to challenge in court. 
The highly restrictive laws Democrats 
would have passed without Republican re­
sistance would have been unconstitutional, 
Strumer said, and therefore easy to tear down. 
“This legislation is the worst-case scenario,” 
Sturmer says. 
But for now, SB-1160 is here to stay. In Jan­
uary, Connecticut district court judge Alfred 
Covello ruled that the law is necessary to pro­
tect the safety of the public, but the CCDL is 
currently appealing its case.
So far, SB-1160 seems to effectively toe the 
line of constitutionality. The Supreme Court 
has affirmed the right of individuals to own 
firearms for “traditionally lawful purposes” 
such as self-defense in the home. SB-1160 
imposes additional regulations on gun owners 
but clearly allows them to continue using their 
guns for shooting practice and self-defense as 
they have in the past. For those who choose to 
comply with all the regulations, after they pay 
fees for registration and permitting, the biggest 
change is the number of bullets they can leave 
in their gun for the drive from home to the 
shooting range. 
Connecticut’s gun laws have traditional­
ly been stricter than those in other states. In 
2011, prior to the passage of SB-1160, the Brady 
Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence ranked 
Connecticut’s laws fifth-strictest in the nation, 
and the state had the sixth-lowest rate of gun 
deaths in the country. 
“Smart gun laws work,” says Ron Pinciaro, 
the executive director of Connecticut Against 
Gun Violence (CAGV). 

he other side can point to facts and num­
bers, too. It’s true that Connecticut has 
the sixth-lowest rate of gun deaths in the na­
tion when suicide deaths are included, but most 
gun owners I talk to do not think gun suicides 
should count towards the statistics—these 
deaths would occur with or without guns. In 
addition, tighter gun laws do not necessarily 
reduce gun violence. According to the Brady 
Campaign, of the twenty-one states that had 
lower rates of firearm homicides than Connect­
icut in 2011, only Massachusetts had stricter 
gun laws. 
In the debate over gun control, objective 
truth is elusive, even when it comes to hard 
numbers. Some elements of the law are just 
coming into effect, and it will be years before 
anyone can assess the impact. Statistics can 
be massaged and cherry-picked, and causation

**The Gun Debate in Connecticut: A Year After Sandy Hook**
**Author: Isabelle Taft**
**Page number(s): 28-29**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The new journal does not follow from correlation. Plus, even defining seemingly simple words such as “violence,” can be difficult. Is it violence, Sturmer asks, when a police officer shoots a criminal in the act of fleeing or committing a crime? Yes, I tell him. Sturmer tells me I need to learn the true definition of violence, which he thinks requires an action to be undertaken with the intention of hurting another out of selfishness.

Furthermore, the opposing sides frequently employ the same analogies and thought experiments to reach completely different conclusions. I ask Pinciaro whether any of the elements of SB-1160, as it has been implemented so far, would have prevented the actions at Sandy Hook. He says this question misses the point because not all violence is preventable, but that does not mean we should not pass laws against violent acts.  
“There’s laws against 
murder and people are going
to commit murders,” 
Pinciaro says. “There are 
always people who are going 
to break the law.”

Cheryl Lemos of the 
CCDL makes the same claim 
to explain her opposition to 
SB-1160: even banning guns 
would not end murder, so we should not restrict 
guns in an attempt to reduce violence.  
“The gun is a tool,” Lemos says. “Take away 
guns, people use knives.” 

A major issue facing the success of the law is 
its enforceability. Though everyone I met 
at the Branford Gun Club said they had registered their guns, most owners of assault weapons haven’t. Yet Connecticut’s Department 
of Emergency Services and Public Protection 
(DESPP), which oversees the state police force 
and keeps records of firearm registration and 
pistol permitting, has not announced any plans 
to confiscate guns or prosecute those who failed 
to register their guns. SB-1160 made possession 
of an unregistered assault weapon a Class D 
felony, punishable by one to ten years in prison. 
The state keeps records of people who undergo 
background checks to purchase assault weapons. So, theoretically, DESPP could cross reference those records with the registration forms 
they received. 
“We’re not even stepping in that direction,” 
DESPP spokesman Paul Vance says. 

The records of background checks and pistol permit applications could have allowed the 
state to directly notify gun owners of the new 
requirement to register. Boucher says she contacted DESPP in August to ask the department 
to do that. It didn’t, but individual legislators 
publicized the law heavily.

Still, some people may have fallen through 
the cracks. Benedetto says he has met several 
people who didn’t register simply because they 
didn’t hear about the changes. He is concerned 
that unwitting gun owners might be charged 
with a class D felony while being questioned 
about a lesser offense. Da­
vid Hartman, media liaison 
for the New Haven Police 
Department, says it would 
be unfeasible to go door to 
door to track down weapons, so picking up gun owners in the course of routine 
police work is exactly what 
will happen. 

Can a law be considered 
effective if it is not truly enforced? Pinciaro and 
Williams say yes, because the ban and registration requirement together will reduce the likelihood of assault weapons falling into the illegal 
gun trade, and some paper trail is better than no 
paper trail at all. But if the state won’t expend 
resources to enforce the law, just how important 
does it really consider that paper trail? Actively 
searching for weapons and arresting offenders 
might be politically unpalatable, but refusing to 
do so sends a strong message that it doesn’t actually matter whether the law achieves its aim, 
lending credibility to gun owners’ arguments 
that SB-1160 was just a political show.

Most gun owners I spoke to have maintained 
skepticism about the state’s intentions, but 
they are steeling themselves for the crackdown 
that may or may not come. The CCDL’s 
membership has grown from about 1,500 
members to 13,000 over the last two years, 
“Take away guns, 
people use knives.”

**Shooting Practice**
**Page number(s): 29**

Gingerly holding the pink camouflage Firestorm, I manage to slap the magazine into 
the gun. It’s time to shoot. Lenny tells me to 
form an isosceles triangle with my body. I’m not 
quite sure what this means, but the couple approves my stance: feet apart, arms straight out, 
elbows locked. Lenny tells me to lean forward. Point the sight where you want the gun to fire. 
Squeeze the trigger with the pad of your index 
finger. Wait for exactly the right second to fire 
before realizing that second won’t come. Fire.

The moment is loud but anticlimactic, and 
mostly I feel relieved that I am capable of shooting a gun. I go through a few magazines, and 
several times I get pretty close to the bull’s-eye, 
which isn’t saying much because a helper moves 
the target close to where I’m standing. It still 
feels good, and the Benedettos are encouraging 
teachers. I smile when I quickly fire off a few 
shots that all nearly meet their mark. 
“Nice shot!” 
“You look like a fucking badass! Dead bad 
guys!” 

My target is designed so that when a bullet 
pierces the black paper, a neon pink, green, or 
orange ring appears around the hole. The rings 
look like Skittles. But a different kind of target 
sits on a table near the front of the range: a 
bullet-pocked plastic model of a pale human 
torso, smeared with red paint imitating rivulets 
of blood streaming down a chest. Perhaps a gun 
is not inherently a tool for evil, but despite gun 
owners’ assurances that shooting is a wholesome 
hobby, the bloody chest makes me think the 
gun’s capacity for violence is part of its appeal.

I practice indoors for a while and then go 
outside to watch Virginia Benedetto shoot down 
bright flying orange discs called pigeons. After 
about four hours, the Benedettos drive me back 
to campus. I carry as souvenirs my pastel-dotted 
target and one of the pigeons I failed to hit with 
a shotgun. The Benedettos shrug off my thanks 
and say they’re always happy to take first-timers 
shooting. 
 “You’re one of us now,” Lenny Benedetto 
says. “You got a gun in your hands, you pulled 
the trigger, and you smiled. You’re one of us 
now.”

I walk back to my dorm and pull the target sheet out of my purse. I toy with the idea 
of hanging it up, but the colorful rings would 
dominate the white wall like a trophy. Still, I 
intend to keep it.

shooting a gun.

I
n a corner of an industrial building just out­
side of New Haven, a woman points a gun at 
a treasured painting. The weapon is loaded, and 
she is ready to fire. She aims carefully, focuses, 
and pulls the trigger. But this gun shoots X-rays, 
not bullets.

As an X-ray strikes the canvas, it jumbles 
the electrons orbiting an atom of paint. The 
atom quickly reshuffles its particles in order to 
regain its former state of equilibrium. In doing 
so, the atom sends back another ray, which con­
tains information about the painting. The gun 
swallows the ray and transmits the information 
to a laptop, which displays a graph cluttered 
with overlapping peaks of various heights. The 
woman shows me how the peaks correspond 
to elements: “Here, you see, this is copper, and 
here is lead. The lead is probably in a white pig­
ment, called lead white.” No one, not even the 
painter himself, has ever known so much about 
this painting’s chemical composition.

The woman behind the gun is a chemist 
named Anikó Bezur. She is the director of sci­
entific research at the Yale Center for Conser­
vation and Preservation (CCAP), a multimil­
lion-dollar facility built in 2012 to house and 
care for the University’s vast art collection. Yale 
owns more than 200,000 pieces of art, from 
pristine Roman busts of Julius Caesar to paint­
ings by Monet and Van Gogh. 

Bezur and her fellow conservators ap­
proach the works with extensive technologi­
cal expertise. With the data obtained by scan­
ners, lenses, lasers, and other instruments, the 
team generates scientific analyses that inform 
their approach to conservation. But despite 
the millions Yale has invested in the CCAP, the 
institution’s central philosophy—that scien­
tific analysis should take the lead in informing 
conservation decisions—remains controversial, 
even among the curators at Yale.

The first time I meet Bezur, she is work­
ing on a painting stored outside the CCAP, in 
a building called the Library Shelving Facil­
ity (LSF). Located in Hamden, Connecticut, a 
ten-minute drive from campus, the windowless 
industrial building stores books, art, and other 
objects belonging to various Yale collections. 
Bezur greets me with a wide smile and shakes

the new journal
my hand. She leads me into a room filled with 
artwork placed on countertops and propped up 
on easels: the LSF’s conservation lab.


Bezur is there to examine the painting in 
the far corner of the studio, the one with the 
X-ray gun pointed at its surface. Called The 
Education of the Virgin, it depicts the Virgin 
Mary’s mother, St. Anne, teaching her how to 
read. The young Mary, draped in a dusky red 
robe, occupies the center of the scene, with her 
parents on either side.


For eighty years, the work was stored, un­
noticed, in the basement of the Yale University 
Art Gallery. Without a signature or any other 
identifying features, it was one of many works 
of unknown origin. But in 2004, a junior curator 
named John Marciari unearthed it and showed 
it to his superiors. Convinced that the painting 
was the work of an identifiable artist, curators 
at the Gallery embarked on an international 
quest to authenticate it. Today, experts recog­
nize the painting as a lost work by the Spanish 
master Diego Velázquez, one of the most im­
portant painters of the 17th century.


Held upright in the LSF by a large wooden 
clamp, The Education of the Virgin is severely 
damaged. Gashes mar its surface, a missing cor­
ner leaves an angel headless at the top of the 
painting, and abrasion has worn down much of 
the paint, disrupting the delicate brushstrokes 
that define Velázquez’s work.


Bezur is working on this painting along­
side her colleague Carmen Albendea. Albendea 
worked on projects in Madrid, Los Angeles, 
Baltimore, and Cambridge, England, before 
coming to Yale in 2012 specifically to determine 
how best to treat the Velázquez in its cracked 
and injured state.


Her goal at the moment is to create a com­
prehensive picture of the chemicals that exist 
in the painting—the base coat, the paint, and 
the varnish—in order to treat the painting’s 
wounds. 


But she also wants to study Velazquez’s 
painting process. To do this, she uses another 
tool, an X-ray radiography machine, to scan 
the canvas. This machine can reveal materials 
hidden beneath the top layer of paint to help 
the scientists understand the artist’s drafts and 
mistakes. A printout of that scan, around five 
feet tall and four feet wide, hangs on the wall. 
It looks like an X-ray you’d see in a doctor’s of­
fice: pearly white shadows outline Mary and St. 
Anne against a pitch-black background.


The printed scan reveals a small table in 
the left-hand corner of the painting. The table 
is laden with bulky objects, invisible in the 
real painting. The original sketch was painted 
over, and is now obscured by the resting arm of 
Mary’s father.


Armed with this kind of information, Al­
bendea plans how best to repair the work. Some 
changes are scientific: She will choose a paint 
that can heal the cracks but is easily remov­
able, in case a future conservator wishes to redo 
her work. Others are aesthetic: She will decide 
whether to repaint the angel’s missing head, or 
whether to leave it as a testament to the age 
of the painting. She will determine how best to 
replicate the delicacy of the brushstrokes that 
once covered the surface of the canvas. For now, 
Albendea is still gathering data to determine 
the next chapter in the painting’s story.


But some at Yale place less stock in sci­
ence’s ability to aid conservators. Among them 
is the Chief Curator of the Yale University Art 
Gallery, Laurence Kanter, who also works as a 
professor of early Italian art in Yale’s History 
of Art department. When we meet, he wears 
a brown suit jacket and speaks in a low tone, 
barely audible over the bustle of the gallery, 
where he has worked since 2002. Kanter previ­
ously curated at the Metropolitan Museum of 
Art in New York City and the Museum of Fine 
Arts in Boston. He considers the data produced 
by scientific analysis to be decidedly secondary 
to the information that an expert eye can ex­
tract from a work of art.


“Science isn’t a way to prove anything,” 
Kanter says. “It’s just more evidence, more data. 
The proof is in the interpretation.”


Kanter strolls around the six galleries of 
early Italian art in the museum. He has played 
an important roll in acquiring the collection. 
We walk past ornate frames hung on walls of 
midnight blue. Mary, Jesus, and a collection of 
saints look back at us, their heads ringed by 
gold haloes.

Although the gold still shines, peeling wood 
on the frames and cracks in the paint reveal 
these works’ age: They were created by pre-
Renaissance masters in the thirteenth and four­
teenth centuries.


Over the past 700 years, many of these 
paintings have suffered significant wear. Expo­
sure to harsh light has faded their colors; heat 
and moisture have warped the wood behind the 
paint; dust and dirt have settled in the cracks 
and yellowed the varnish that overlies the tem­
pera. In some cases, the original works have 
been painted over by past conservators who 
thought they were improving or restoring the 
work.


Caretakers must carefully consider which 
cracks to fill with modern paint and how to 
repair large swatches of lost color. Kanter ar­
gues that a historian, not a piece of equipment, 
must answer these questions. He is well versed 
in the history of art conservation at Yale. Walk­
ing from painting to painting in the gallery, he 
recounts the conservation decisions that have 
determined the way the works look now. 
 “This is the problem,” he says. “Science and 
aesthetics are not compatible undertakings. 
They don’t need to be compatible. Nobody 
wants them to be compatible.”


To illustrate this point, he stops in front of 
a pair of portraits hanging side-by-side, one of 
St. Peter and the other of St. John the Baptist. 
A single artist of unknown identity painted this 
pair in Siena, Italy around the year 1320. The 
portraits are extremely similar: the saints look 
directly at the viewer, wearing slightly worried 
expressions.


Both saints sit on a backdrop of gold leaf. A 
thin circle—a halo—circumscribes their heads. 
Other patterns are impressed and inscribed be­
tween the halo and the head to alter the gold’s 
reflectivity. Just outside the halo is a concentric 
circle of triangular patterns composed of three 
small dots, punched into the gold to emphasize 
the contour of the halo.


Although the artist created the back­
grounds of the paintings in the same way, they 
look noticeably different today. St. John’s por­
trait looks much like it did 700 years ago, with 
patterns of distinct circles ringing the halo. But 
St. Peter’s halo is instead surrounded by dull tri­
angles, the three dots blurred together. 


The difference was not an artist’s error, but 
a result of differing attitudes toward conserva­
tion. Yale conservators treated the painting of 
St. Peter, gouged with holes, in the sixties. They 
left the painting of St. John, with its pattern of 
delicate circles, untouched. 


The modifications to the former painting 
reflect a certain trend in art conservation in the 
sixties. “There was a lengthy moment in [the art 
gallery’s] history,” Kanter says, “when the insti­
tution felt that all of its conservation practice 
should be guided by scientific inquiry, produc­
ing particularly horrifying results.”


In treating the painting of St. Peter, the 
1960s conservator attempted to remove debris 
that had settled into each small hole punched in 
the pattern. Though he removed the dirt care­
fully, he also, inevitably, removed the tiny flakes 
of gold leaf that had kept the small holes sepa­
rate and distinct.


“All he was interested in was the materials, 
not the impression,” Kanter says. “The dirt en­
hances the original effect; it doesn’t obscure it.”


The picture treated by conservators differs, 
too, in that its colors are stronger than those in

the unaltered picture. St. Peter’s shirt is a bright cerulean 
blue; the book he holds is a strong scarlet. In contrast, 
St. John wears robes of faded brown. This difference, like 
that of the haloes, arose because conservators cleaned off 
St. Peter, rubbing off the yellowed varnish with chemical 
solvent, but left St. John alone.
“Is that more faithful to the original?” Kanter asks. 
“No. The only thing it’s faithful to is the original materi­
als, not the original look or intention of the picture.”

Anikó Bezur and her team at the CCAP have a dif­
ferent definition of intention. Located in a former phar­
maceutical building on Yale’s West Campus, the CCAP’s 
squat industrial façade cuts a rather figure, especially on 
a rainy afternoon. I arrive sopping wet in the lobby where 
Jens Stenger, a physicist who works at the CCAP, greets 
me and invites me to hang up my rain jacket on the hook 
next to his desk. We walk into the first lab of many, a 
spotless room glittering with dozens of new machines. 
Stenger pauses before each piece of equipment to explain 
its function. One machine reveals which molecules reso­
nate at different frequencies, while another sorts mole­
cules by their size, determining, in a few minutes, exactly 
which elements an oil painting contains.

Bezur joins us in a room housing an electron micro­
scope, which is several feet tall and wide. We make small 
talk for a few moments before I ask her what she thinks 
about Kanter’s view of the relationship between science 
and conservation.

She bursts out: “You talked to Larry?” Then she 
laughs. I ask her what’s so funny. “I just think he has a…
very different perspective,” she says diplomatically.

Bezur becomes more serious as she acknowledges 
the truth she sees in Kanter’s argument. She agrees that 
science has its limits. “There’s no scientific signature for 
Velázquez,” Bezur says. “It’s not like a unique DNA im­
print, unless we were to find his hair and find a match; 
and short of that it’s very difficult to say that something 
was made by this person’s hand.”

Stenger too recognizes that there are certain areas of 
art study in which science is not at all useful. “If you’re re­
ally interested in all the stories and the history, you can­
not uncover who Botticelli was friends with by looking 
under the microscope,” he says. “So there’s this huge area 
to which I think you can really securely say that science 
has very little or nothing to contribute.”

But Stenger and Bezur maintain that scientific analy­
sis can and should be a large part of conservators’ de­
cision making. Through analysis of pigments’ chemical 
structures, Stenger can determine how and from where

an artist long ago acquired his materials, and how they 
were made. The chemical decomposition of a blue color 
tells him when the pigment was made, and a chemical 
analysis of the lacquer used in a varnish reveals the sap 
from which it was made.

Bezur does not devalue Kanter’s expertise. She main­
tains, however, that technological analysis of artwork is 
the truly objective measure upon which museum direc­
tors and others requiring artistic analysis should rely.
“For many, many centuries, people got along just fine 
without the scientists,” she says. She pauses, then con­
tinues sarcastically: “And I love going into storerooms 
and finding the half a million dollar mistake that was 
just based on a good eye and plenty of experience.” She 
laughs. “That’s all I have to say.” 

Kanter and other conservators who rely on their own 
eyes for interpretation are not exactly Luddites. “An art­
ist like Velázquez is more complicated than any other 
artist,” Kanter concedes, “because his painting technique 
was so subtle and so complex that the more you can learn 
about it—including its elemental component materials—
the better prepared you are to know how to overcome 
issues.”

The knowledge gained from Albendea’s radiography 
scan of The Education of the Virgin can deepen art his­
torians’ understanding of Velázquez’s painting process. 
The information is undoubtedly useful for certain kinds 
of research and analysis. But Kanter insists that this data 
remain secondary to expert opinion when it comes to 
restoration, because technology creates credulity: “Peo­
ple are willing to believe whatever an instrument with 
a needle on it will tell them, thinking that that is the 
answer, a Geiger counter.” He maintains that care must 
be taken to use scientific analysis only as supporting evi­
dence, and never as a definitive answer.

But the curator and the chemist often have a com­
mon goal: preservation. The master artists of the past 
conveyed their visions using fragile materials, and we’re 
left to deal with the decay. Bezur and Kanter are shuffling 
through the debris using different techniques, and each 
is wary of the jurisdiction of the other. Both are trying 
to speak up for artists long gone. If only the artists could 
speak for themselves.

A graduate of Harvard College and the Iowa 
Writers’ Workshop, Leslie Jamison is currently 
a Ph.D. candidate in English at Yale. Her first 
novel, The Gin Closet, was published in 2011. 
A book of essays, The Empathy Exams, was 
released this month. It explores questions of 
pain through personal and journalistic writing.  
She sat down with The New Journal to discuss 
switching genres, teaching writing, and talking 
to strangers. 
The New Journal: How did you make the transition 
from writing fiction to writing nonfiction?
Leslie Jamison: I had always thought of myself 
as a fiction writer, and that identity pretty much 
carried me through the entire course of my first 
novel. It was in the process of writing my sec­
ond novel that I started writing essays. It was 
really frustrating for me to kind of get a beat on 
it, get some sense of its pulse, so I found my­
self following little escape hatches into nonfic­
tion projects. Also, nonfiction lends itself more 
easily to certain kinds of conversations. It feels 
like a beginning to a set of conversations rather 
than a transactional, “I’ve written this and now 
I gave it to you.”

Do you think that you’re the same writer when you’re 
writing fiction as when you’re writing nonfiction?

I feel like the same person when writing fiction 
and nonfiction. A lot of the same fixations and 
sites of interest come across. I’m really interest­
ed in how physical bodies shape experience—
that’s all over my fiction and nonfiction. In my

novel, there are dramas on the level of the body, 
like an eating disorder or an addiction. In my 
essays, I write about disease and empathy in a 
medical context. That attention to bodies is ev­
ident in craft too. When I’m writing nonfiction, 
I walk into a room and take the time to note 
all of these physical particulars, because I know 
that when I’m writing the scene two weeks lat­
er, I’ll be so frustrated if I can’t fill that scene 
with tangible details. I have to build my muscles 
as a nonfiction writer to satisfy the same aes­
thetic impulses that I carry over from fiction.

There’s a part in the book’s title piece in which you 
think of saying to the people around you that your 
experience [in this case, as a medical actor] might ap­
pear in a book someday. As you have moved toward 
nonfiction, do you operate with that thought in mind? 
I do think that that sort of double vision, think­
ing about an experience in terms of how I might 
someday write about it, does creep up on me all 
the time. In that way it’s like being a traveler 
who’s constantly taking photographs, thinking 
about how to document the thing rather than 
just living inside of it. Sometimes that makes 
me feel a little bit sad, or claustrophobic, or 
like my experience is wrapped in this shroud 
of constant self-awareness. But there’s some­
thing productive in it. Left to my own devices, 
I would never talk to a stranger on a bus ride. 
But especially if I’m traveling and I’m like, I 
want to write about this place, I’m more likely 
to convince myself to start up a conversation 
with somebody. Because who knows where it 
will go or lead?

Does a desire to create a public point affect how in­
tensely you pursue a story, or do you just jump off the 
cliff and assume that something will show up?

I guess I like to believe that any story that I’m 
interested in could potentially have a public 
point, because I believe that one person’s inter­
est usually points to some deeper shared root 
system of interest. I usually have some sense 
of what I think the kernel of that point might 
be before I jump off the cliff. But not always. I 
think there can be something really satisfying 
about working your way towards a point.

I’m working on a piece about a whale that sci­
entists have been tracking for years. They call it 
the loneliest whale in the world, because it has 
a frequency that’s much higher than other blue 
whales. And whenever scientists track it, it’s 
alone. I had a sense that there was some more 
abstract point here that has to do with our re­
lationship to loneliness, or why we project feel­
ings onto animals, or how we try to make the 
natural world make emotional sense—but I 
didn’t have a clear sense of what the center was 
going to be.

You’ve taught students in English 120, “Reading and 
Writing the Modern Essay,” and your parents were 
professors. What does your relationship to teaching 
feel like?

The energy of teaching is so different from 
the energy of writing. I still get a little bit of 
an adrenaline rush before I walk into a class­
room, I love that you have an experience that’s 
bounded in time, you’re hearing other people’s 
voices, and there’s a dynamism in responding to 
their ideas. All that is different from the pro­
cess of sitting down to write in ways that feel 
very saving and energizing to me.

That feeling of giving students permission to 
write stuff that feels thorny and tricky and un-
figured-out is fun. It feels like I’m doing a ser­
vice by granting them license to dig deeper into 
ideas they already have in inchoate form. I’ll 
remember those times when I hit my own con­
ceptual tangle in a piece, and I can hear myself 
telling a student: “that’s a good sign, go deeper 
into it.”

Ask her if you can pull the car 
over and pray.
Your daughter says yeah, 
and you almost keep going 
because you’re expecting a 
no.  
You open the car door, 
and an exploded blue pen 
falls out onto the dirt road.
Leave the car door open 
because it’s not a busy road 
but pick up the pen and put it 
in your pocket 
that’s already ink-stained.
Your daughter watches out 
the car window at your back
as you cut through the long 
grass 
and under one ash and a 
couple of cedar trees.  
Look up at the sky for a 
couple of seconds 
and then look down. 
And your glasses are about to 
slip off your face.
Over your cream turtleneck 
you’re wearing a red and 
green Christmas sweater, 
But, yes it is still October, 
isn’t it.
It’ll only take a minute.
Then, back in the car you go, 
saying something 
about the trees.
Then you’re home, pulling up 
alongside the barn 
where your other daughter is 
bringing in the Haflinger for 
the night.
She says, “Mamma watch” as 
she lets her go trotting into 
the stable without a lead.
Let your daughter see you 
starting to go angry 
And then almost like you’re 
going to cry, 
And she’ll know it’s an 
answer.
When you step into the 
kitchen and out of your boots 
you’ll say, “what does anybody 
want for dinner.” 
Empty a pocket on the table.
Out comes a folded up piece 
of paper.
You ripped it.  Seem upset.
Be ready for your daughter 
to say “that’s alright mamma 
we’ll fix it together.”
But just sort of leave, the 
ends of your socks hanging 
way off the tips of your toes.
That daughter of yours wipes 
down the counter and flattens 
out the creases of the paper, 
sees 
it’s not even legible—not 
even 
English she doesn’t think,
and that her mamma still has 
the other half, don’t you?
She’ll slide it behind the jar of 
coins
on the ledge beside the bowl 
of potatoes.
They’re not good enough to 
eat, not bad enough to throw 
outside.
She’ll climb up on that ledge, 
take down 
the dusty floral curtain, 
looking for a moment at the 
willow branch laying in the 
yard.
When she makes a frustrated 
sound and you ask “what?”
from your bed two rooms 
away
she’ll say, “I stepped in the 
dog’s water dish.”

I know many lovely girls who 
wait on beaches, I know turtles
 
birth themselves by their egg’s
nervous stirrings. They rock 
their little circles in the sand.
The globe shakes itself too, but 
it rests on no sand thus
leaves no mark. I rose up 
from the sand, I’ll admit. 
My skin a salt lick the sun 
won’t even acknowledge.
The waves threaten me daily
with their animal shapes. 
I name each billow and roller
And cry at their breakage. 
I own no bowls, and no spigot,
but my mouth and my hands.
I swallow the ocean one cup 
at a time. These marks me 
a prophet- now give me a cave.
I’ll take in some visitors,
The muscled heroic ones
strewn on my shores with 
their large ships in pieces. 
I’ll fill their palms then their 
lungs then I’ll flood them with
promises. Cast them back to the 
beaches and tell them to wait.
