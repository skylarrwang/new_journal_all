Gerald Harrington, who has since retired 
from the paper. Arons's successor as city 
editor, Phil Shandler-another young 
Harrington recruit-also left for a Wash-
ington job after a couple of years as city 
editor. "Under Shandler, we used to call 
the paper Ebony," the current city editor 
of the Courier, Bob Granger, told me once 
-the implication being that Shandler was 
too sympathetic to blacks for the paper's 
liking. 

But most Courier and Register editors 
stay with the organization. They have 
settled down in their homes, their children 
are in local schools-a change is a far more 
drastic move for them than for reporters. 
Instead, they learn to get along with the 
publishers and the organization. They 
know not to push too hard or too fast-
small changes will be made if they wait 
long enough.

The editors feel happy with the status quo 
-just the way, perhaps, that patriarch 
publisher John Day Jackson would have 
wanted them to be. Jackson was a good 
Yalie-<:hairman of the Yale Daily News, 
in fact. After graduation in 1890, he spent 
a year in Europe, a year at Harvard Law 
School, and four years as a newsman in 
New York and Washington. In 1896, 
Jackson came back to New Haven as 
manager of one of the city's many local 
newspapers, the New Haven Register. It 
looked like a nice paper, and Jackson 
wanted to buy it, so he called a well-heeled 
college buddy, Sam York, and the two of 
them purchased the paper. John Day took 
complete control ten years later, and the 
Register has been owned by the Jackson 
family ever since. 

With his New Haven daily, Jackson 
managed to work his way into the 
American pantheon of Horatio Algers. 
Seventy years ago, publishing a newspaper 
did not involve marketing surveys, time-
efficiency studies and smooth corporate 
chess. The publishers, like other business-
men, were tyrants: ruthlessly competitive, 
driven and driving, dogmatic, outspoken 
and penny-pinching. While Adolph Ochs 
at the New York Times was creating his 
legend in pursuit of an unobtainable im-
partiality, up the road in New Haven John 
Day Jackson was creating his own legend 
of unyielding conservatism. He is re-
membered by many in New Haven today 
with a mixture of nostalgia (for his 
individualism and eccentricity) and scorn 
(for his insensitivity to social problems). 

"All his life, he worked harder and longer 
than anyone else in the organization except 
his secretary," recalls one person who 
knew him. 

Jackson purchased one of the city's 
morning newspapers, the Journal-Courier, 
in 1925. While other New Haven papers 
-the Union, the Times. and the Leader-
languished and perished, the Register and 
Journal-Courier survived the Depres-
sion. Jackson was anxious to drive out his 
New Haven competition. According to 
one story still making the rounds in New 
Haven, he would tell advertisers who were 
in financial trouble "not to worry" about 
paying him. Later on, the story goes, after 
the clients were on sound financial footing, 
Jackson would show them the back bills 
and threaten to ask for payment unless 
they confined their advertising to his 
papers. 

Jackson was not fond of Roosevelt and 
the New Deal. Once, in 1935, be success-
fully campaigned in Washington to defeat 
a New Deal measure which would have 
raised estate and inheritance taxes. He 
told Henry Morgenthau and others that 
the tax bill would wipe out large and small 
family businesses. For his role in defeating 
the legislation, Jackson was praised by 
Times columnist Arthur Krock. 

As the years passed, some New Haven 
observers began to wonder whether Jack-
son wanted a family business at all, or 
whether he would try to take the presses 
with him. His sons Dick (Yale '34) and 
Lionel (Yale '37) went right to work for 
father, and waited and waited. They must 
have gotten a bit restless. In 1953, Dick 
(he was then forty-three years old and his 
father eighty-five) merited the momentous 
promotion from "assistant to the publish-
er," his title of the previous fifteen years, 
to the new position of "assistant pub-
lisher." Old man Jackson continued to 
keep his hand in the business for another 
long seven years, until at last, bedridden in 
Grace-New Haven Hospital in late 1 960, 
he finally relinquished control to his sons. 

Five months later, John Day Jackson 
died at age ninety-three. His strong oppo-
sition to estate and inheritance taxes 
became understandable when the Jackson 
estate was valued at $61,207,934. (It 
must have been a "heavy news" week in 
New Haven when this figure was made 
public. The Hartford Times carried the 
story, but the New Haven papers had 
not a word.) 

Those who expected rapid change in the 
New Haven papers after the death of the 
elder Jackson did not know the family. 
The two papers remained antediluvian in 
politics (they were among the few non-
Southern newspapers to endorse Barry 
Goldwater in 1964); Victorian in morals 
(until a couple of years ago, the word 
"rape" was edited to "assault", and the 
Yale Drama School production of ''Tis 
Pity She's A Whore" was once renamed 
"Tis Pity She's Bad"); and niggardly in 
business (the news staff remains non-union, 
salaries are abominable, and morale is 
low). 

The two Jackson sons-who are said to 
feud on occasion-have divided their re-
sponsibilities, with Dick concentrating on 
news and editorials and Lionel on business. 
Many of the key news and editorial 
positions are still held by men recruited 
and trained in the anci~n regime of John 
Day. Today, while even the New York 
Daily News rushes along young college 
and journalism-school graduates, the 
Register organization changes little. The 
executive editor of the two papers since 
1961 has been Robert J. Leeney. a native 
New Haven boy who joined the Register 
as a reporter and drama critic in 1940 
and has been writing the Jackson's right-

wing editorials for more than twenty years. 
Second-ranking in the news hierarchy is 
Charles T. "Charlie" McQueeney, who 
graduated from a New Haven high school 
in 1927 and has been with the Register 
ever since. Among Register reporters, 
McQueeney is known for his policeman-
fireman mentality. His car contains a 
police radio, and he sometimes cruises up 
and down New Haven streets at night, 
apparently dreaming of action. 

While Dick and Lionel Jackson have 
carried their father's ideas and some of 
his top aides through the 1960's, the future 
publisher, a third-generation Jackson, bas 
also begun to learn the game of monopoly. 
He is Herrick Jackson, a lanky, amiable 
young man, grandson of John Day Jackson 
and nephew of the current publishers. 
Herrick graduated from Yale in 1962, 
then went on to Columbia Journalism 
School; he served briefly as city ball re-
porter for the Journal-Courier, and also 
apprenticed for two years at the Louisville 
Courier-Journal, where an editor says he 
was not overly ambitious and remained a 
"publisher's relative" employee. 

Around New Haven, Herrick bas lent 
the impression that be would like somehow 
to remove the newspaper's notoriety. He is 
the only Jackson who has conversed on 
occasion with several of the disaffected 
young reporters, or who attends Yale 
seminars with Tom Wicker and others. 
Under Herrick, it is said, the paper will at 
least moderate if not change its editorial 
stances: it may make some of the same 
changes which other newspapers are 
making in the 1960's. But it will be making 
them in the 1980's.

The opinions and whims of the publishers 
are the basis for most of the Catch-22 
decisions which make the Register and 
Journal-Courier what they are. But despite 
the fact that the papers suffer under the 
same anachronistic administration, they 
are not quite two peas in a pod. In com-
parison with one another, the two papers 
are noticeably different. The Journal-
Courier traditionally has allowed its re-
porters a bit more freedom in their 
writing, and it has often hired the kind of 
writers who like to develop their own style. 
Since these reporters come and depart 
quickly, the small morning paper has an 
anarchic, unpredictable quality to it: it 
usually contains the more interesting re-
porting of the two competing city staffs, 
and also (when it is forced to use a new 
young reporter) has a knack for the 
journalistic godawful. 

At the death of John Day Jackson, a 
Journal-Courier obituary noted, almost 
plaintively, that after the purchase of the 
morning paper in 1925, "The Register 
remained his (Jackson's) chief concern." 
There could be no question of this. Over 
the years, the Register company devoted so 
little financial or promotional effort to the 
Journal-Courier that most observers as-
