The Dry Cleaners Association of America held its annual convention in Detroit a couple of years ago and two girls from a local modeling school were hired as hostesses. The dirty old cleaning men tried to pick up the girls during their meetings. Upon receiving the offers one of the girls laughed and the other one got mad. Last summer the one who got mad became Miss America. 

Miss America's name is Pam Eldred, and members of the Women's Liberation Front, alas, must mourn, for she appears unwilling to lend her prestige (or even her bra) to the noble cause. But fear not, for Pam is not without her beliefs. 

On the pressing issue of our times, for example: "I've never had any contact with anyone who has taken drugs," says Pam. (Actually the other dry cleaning girl smokes pot, but don't tell.) 

On her parents: They are "great friends. We sit down and talk about something and if I think they have a better point than I do, I listen to them, and if they think I have a better point they agree with me." 

And radical students: "I'm a firm believer in authority," says Pam. "Why should I defy my elders just for the sake of defying them?" 

Ah, yes, the passing scene can often get one down. But should the tale of Miss America prove too much for you, take solace in an item buried way on the inside of the second section of the Times one Tuesday morning a couple of weeks ago. The headline read: "Champi, Harvard Star Last Season, Gives Up Football." This news came after Harvard lost to BU in an upset. I knew Cham pi had played in the game and figured that he must have gotten hurt. But the headline didn't say anything about an injury; it just said be "gave up." 

Gave up? What's going on? A good all-American-boy type athlete does not just "give up." No fortitude, no guts, no perseverance, a case of unamerican activity pure and simple. But wait-maybe there's another angle, maybe he was failing three of his courses, maybe he has to study real hard for his business school exams or something, maybe it's a case of true love with a Radcliffe honey in the picture with whom Cham pi would rather spend his time, maybe he's going to drop out of Harvard to sign up with the Green Berets. 

No, it was simpler. Champi asked himself why he was playing football, decided that he did not know and, in a distinctly unsisphus-like existential moment, decided there was no sense trying any more. 

"I've been thinking about my relation to the game for a long time-several years. I kept asking myself why I was playing. I wasn't doing it for publicity, or for pride, or for the thrill of victory. I wasn't getting those things from it. I can't take the game seriously any more."
