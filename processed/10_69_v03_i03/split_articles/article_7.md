The Psychopathology of 
Seminar Life 
by Lloyd Etheredge 
One of the most unhappy experiences is a 
seminar which never gets off the ground, 
which is felt to be a burden, a drag, by 
all of its members. Neither the students nor 
the professor look forward with excite-
ment or anticipation to its meetings. 

Outside of the seminar, students freely 
voice their frustration. Many professors 
have known the frustration for years and 
have come to expect it. Yet our "dragging 
seminars~' continue in their semi-comatose 
state with students and professor alike 
half-heartedly playing out their roles to the 
end. The diagnosis presented by many 
(e.g. the SDS), that the problem lies only 
with the structure of educational institu-
tions is, it seems to me, naive. 

Outside of seminars, students are active 
and energetic. Yet, as a seminar gets 
underway, they lapse into a state of 
nervousness, inhibition and depression. 
This is motivated behavior, and it is a com-
mon occurrence. What is going on? 

Psychoanalytic theory can, I think, ex-
plain these curious symptoms which plague 
our seminars. To see our seminars as case 
studies in the "psychopathology of every-
day life" is an approach we might wish 
to avoid. But the truth appears to be, as the 
psychoanalyst and educator Lawrence 
Kubie has noted, that "there is an incessant 
interaction between universal but subtly 
masked neurotic mechanisms and the 
educational process, and .. , as a result of 
this interplay, education is blocked and 
distorted. The relationship between the 
two is evidently so close that both must be 
$01ved if either is to be solved." 

That the· mechanisms about which 
Kubie speaks are alive in our seminars 
seems apparent. Part of the painful evi-
dence we all observe-the nervousness, 
depression and inhibition mentioned 
above, for example-suggests that a semmar 
setting does affect aggressive and erotic 
drives in ways that temporarily induce 
neurotic symptoms in students. Since both 
aggressive and erotic drives are intimately 
and powerfully involved in learning, it is 
plausible that the educational process in 
seminars is also less effective than it might 
be. The aggressive requirements in learn-
ing are clear enough: the challenging of 
ideas, the rejection of hypotheses, the 
analysis and breaking down of an argu-
ment into its component parts. And much 
has been written about the importance of 
sexual curiosity as a basis for attraction to 
intellectual activity. Abraham Maslow, a 
psychologist specializing in human motiva-
tion, suggests that we consider the process 
of knowing "at an unconscious level ... 
as an intrusive penetrating-into, as a kind 
of masculine sex-role equivalent." 

Why do the unfortunate inner conflicts 
which help to create the "dragging semi-
nar" appear? What can we do about the 
problem? Two starting points for this 
psychoanalytic investigation suggest th~m­
selves. The first, and probably more bas1c, 
looks primarily at aggressive confticts-
Freud's primal horde model. The second 
looks at eroticism and seduction. 

Lloyd Ethuedge is a second year gradUilte 
student in international relations and a 
teaching assistant in political science. 

Briefly, Freud's primal horde model 
suggests that an authoritarian "father" 
leader in a group inhibits both the aggres-
sive and erotic drives of male "sons." The 
sons resent the authority of the father 
and also feel he owns the women in the 
group. They remain inhibited and inde-
pendent because they are afraid of him. 
They unconsciously wish his death and 
wish to devour him. After they have killed 
and eaten him, they transfer libido to one 
another, forming a "community" and 
feeling united by unconscious bonds of 
guilt for their deed, for they also loved the 
father. 

How does behavior in our seminars 
reflect the dynamics of the primal horde? 
Aggression is inhibited in the seminar since 
its prime focus in the here-and-now situa-
tion would be the feared authoritarian 
father (professor). It can be turned back 
against the self or suppressed, thus yield-
ing depression. It can be expressed in 
silent protest and hostility by refusing to 
do "assigned" reading, producing the pain-
ful but humorous scene we are all familiar 
with: 

Professor (hopefully): "What did you 
think of the reading?" 
Students: Oong, nervous silence; stu-
dents, eyes downcast, each hoping some-
one has done the reading.) 

The failure of many students to 
prepare for seminar discussions, although 
possibly harmful academically in the 
tong-run, may be a way of asserting inde-
pendence against professors (parent 
surrogates) and actually aid personal 
growth. 

Nervous aggression may also be seen in 
seminars in a disguised form of displaced 
hostility to authors under discussion, the 
curious put-downs that sometimes appear 
(another student serving as "stand-in" for 
the professor), or the extended and tan-
gential comments of individuals seeki":g to 
reduce.anxiety. Other defense mechan1sms 
may be employed: withdrawal ("cutting 
class") or identification with the professor 
(e.g. a student who is speaking to the 
group or even to another student will, 
when he finishes his point, look nervously 
or hopefully to the professor instead of 
toward his fellow students). The deep fear 
of being "wrong" in a seminar appears as 
a fear on the part of the student of sym-
bolic castration by the professor. 

I do not mean to suggest that cutting 
class, hostility to authors, not doing 
assigned reading and looking for the pro-
fessor's reaction are necessarily neurotic 
symptoms. These can also be rational 
reactions or expressions of genuine needs. 
But in the present state of our seminars 
even these actions are done nervously 
and often appear to be symptomatic. Not 
until the problem of authority and its 
associated fears are worked through, 
Freud's model suggests, can students be 
free to be erotically involved in their learn-
ing in acquiring the knowledge previously 
felt to be "owned" by the professor. Nor, 
until students feel the security of a com-
munity, can they relax and feel completely 
free to express confusions, advance new 
ideas, and develop their thinking.
