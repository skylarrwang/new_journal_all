The next day, the Register dutifully 
recited the gory details again. But there 
were a few changes. The ice pick became 
"a small sword," perhaps to add variety to 
the story. And many of the charges were 
mentioned without the appended phrase, 
"police claim." The accusations, in other 
words, were being described as facts-a 
classic case of a newspaper offering its 
own guilty verdict before the case had 
even come to triaL 


On the Hill and in Dixwell, New 
Raven's black community, ministers and 
militants alike, will say without hesitation 
that the New Haven papers do not repre-
sent their views or interests. And in the 
combined newsroom of the two papers, 
one can easily discern a chilly mistrust 
among editors whenever a black, or any 
known advocate of the poor, brings in a 
press release. In the same newsroom, visit-
ing white politicians are welcomed like old 
friends.

Unity For An 
Honorable Peace 
Examining my schedule one day last 
winter, I noticed that a well-known New 
Haven black leader was scheduled to 
speak at the Yale School of Public Health 
the following afternoon. Mentioning the 
speech to the editor in charge, I asked 
whether he would want a photographer 
there. He didn't. As I walked away, the 
editor called me back. 
"We don't want a public relations job 
about this guy," he told me, flagrantly 
violating the fundamental principle in 
journalism that reporters go to an event 
without preconceptions. "I've seen this 
guy," the editor continued, "and I know 
who he is." 
Barely suppressing my fury, I asked 
who he was. 
"He's a junkie with a big mouth." 


After the ghetto disturbances in August, 
1967, veteran J ournal..C ourier reporter 
Bill Betsch, who has since left the paper, 
went out and interviewed scores of 
people. According to Betsch, their feelings, 
reactions and explanations filled an entire 
reporter's notebook. 
But the newspaper turned aside all sug-
gestions that it might run any probing 
articles about why the disturbances had 
occurred-the kind of articles which so 
many other papers tried to write. Readers 
of the New Haven papers could find no 
serious attempts to explain what hap-
pened; the material of perhaps the most 
skiJied interviewer in town was not used. 
Instead, there was an editorial about the 
courage of the police force. 


One afternoon last January, I received 
word that the Hill Parents' Association 
would be having a press conference the 
following morning. Working for the 
morning Journal-Courier, I was assigned, 
in such cases, to report the substance of 
the morning press conference before it 
occurred-thereby "beating" the afternoon 
papers which would otherwise carry the 
news first. 


I went to see John Barber at HPA and 
persuaded him to give me a copy of the 
statement he would read at the morning 
press conference. That statement, drafted 
by Barber, called upon black people to 
desert Dick Lee in the coming mayoral 
race. It was the first political statement of 
the year from the black community. 


Bringing the statement into the news-
room, I showed it to an editor and went to 
work. In the course of the evening, I 
developed what is known as a "new angle" 
in the story: I called Hank Parker, then 
chairman of the Black Coalition, and was 
surprised to hear Parker say that the Black 
Coalition was thinking of forming its own 
political organization. Parker also said 
gingerly that be might resign from the 
Black Coalition to direct such a group-a 
statement which broadly hinted at his own 
eventual candidacy. 


That night I combined the HP A "dump-
Lee" statement and Parker's comments 
into a rather staid, prosaic article of 
standard length, adding whatever informa-
tion I could find about the role of blacks 
in past New Haven elections. 


After quietly and routinely discussing 
the articles with an editor at least three 
times during the evening, I handed in the 
piece, waited while it was edited, was told 
there were no problems, and left for the 
night without sensing any controversy. 


The next morning, to my amazement, I 
opened up the Journal-Courier city page 
to find two banal wire-service stories 
where my article had been placed. The 
story about blacks and politics did not 
appear in the paper. Two editors, I was 
later told, had suddenly killed the story at 
one o'clock that morning-it was a most un-
usual move, never fully explained to me. 


Those two editors have since been 
promoted. They are now the city editor 
and assistant city editor of the Journal-
Courier.

These incidents serve as an introduc-
tion to the newsroom of the New Haven 
newspapers, with its frequent rigidity, 
mistrust, discouragement of initiative 
and prejudice. 


There is a myth in New Haven about 
the Register and Journal-Courier, as there 
is about many newspapers in this country 
so obsessed with conspiracy. According to 
the myth, the ruling Jackson family 
censors every single page from every re-
porter's typewriter, adding and deleting as 
it wishes until the story represents its own 
interests. 


In fact, the publishers rarely rewrite 
copy; they do not have to. The character 
of the New Haven papers 4s determined 
by an elaborate social system which the 
publishers have helped to foster. That 
social system includes the practices and 
attitudes of reporters and editors, and the 
relationships among them. That character 
is perpetuated by promotions for the 
favored, and by the discouragement and 
eventual alienation or departure of those 
who do not like the paper's character. 


It sounds complicated, but the result is 
simple. More or less, without heavy-
handed censorship, the paper comes to 
look as its publishers wish it to look. 


At the bottom of the news hierarchy 
are the reporters. New Haven reporters are 
the most diverse group of people in the 
building. Some are former copy boys, 
some Yale graduates; some are from 
working-class backgrounds and others 
staunchly middle-class. Since their jobs 
take them out of the building to the streets, 
where they observe social conflict first-
hand, they tend to be less biased, as a 
group, than others on the paper. 


But the reporters are vulnerable to a 
number of temptations, of which by far 
the greatest is the pressure to become a 
crony of the persons or agency one is 
assigned to write about. 


New Haven reporters have done well 
with the Lee administration. At least two 
current administration or party func-
tionaries, Fred Gross and Byrne Stoddard, 
left the New Haven papers to work for 
Lee. On the current Register staff, urban 
affairs reporter Donald Dallas has almost 
never challenged CPI (the anti-poverty 
agency) or the redevelopment agency. 
C harles Hines has been the best press 
agent the police department ever had; 
Marion McDonald has been a close ally of 
the New Haven school bureaucracy, and 
Frank Whalen, an excellent reporter, bas 
in the past year been considered by some 
observers to be a Lee oracle. In that deli-
cate task of obtaining stories and informa-
tion without compromising independence, 
the Register fares very badly. 


There are a number of attractions and 
rewards for the reporters who agree to 
play along with the game. A few of these 
are rather concrete: any Connecticut 
political reporter who is not an outright 
alcoholic can live for weeks on the bottles 
of liquor which flow in from the politicians 
each Christmas. 


But New Haven reporters are seldom 
bought. The system isn't that simple. 
Rather, their independence is slowly 
eroded away in several ways. First, re-
porters get the psychological rewards of 
being insiders who vicariously share power 
through the information they obtain-
even if it is given on a useless off-the-
record basis. Second, the reporters find it 
easier to get their stories and information 
when they are kind in print to their news 
sources. When the Register was easy and 
the JourTUll-Courier a bit rough on Lee 
and Adams last winter, the city began to 
give most of its important releases to the 
Register. It was safer that way. And third, 
in simple human terms, most reporters 
like to get along with all those people, 
including city officials, with whom they 
must converse on a daily basis. 


The city ac;fministration has its sanc-
tions, too. It is sometimes willing to tol-
erate dissent, but only so much. When 
Journal-Courier city hall reporter Howard 
Abramson overstepped that line once last 
winter in a story about the city's dealings 
with Yale, Lee asked Abramson to lunch 
at Mory's and told him sweetly, "I don't 
bear grudges." Perhaps not, but Lee had 
made his anger known, and Abramson 
could hardly help but think twice before 
plunging in next. time. 


Beyond withholding stories from are-
porter and warning him, the city adminis-
tration may on occasion call or write 
editors about articles which it does not 
like. When Register urban affairs reporter 
Don Dallas wrote a rare critical story 
early this year about a city report on 
housing-code enforcement, Adams, the 
development administrator, wrote an 
angry letter to executive editor Leeney. It 
seemed to cool Dallas's temporary fever. 


New Haven police chief James Ahern has 
had more run-ins with the New Haven 
editors than the rest of the Lee administra-
tion. In part, Ahern's problems are due to 
the fact that some of the editors do not 
like his tough advocacy of gun control. 
For vague reasons or fears best left to the 
reader's imagination, at least two editors 
have carried weapons in the newsroom. 
But Ahern also does not hesitate to pick 
up the phone and call the editors when 
stories displease him. In New Haven, there 
simply is no concept of the right of a 
reporter to set down his own observations 
while still retaining freedom of informa-
tion. A reporter who is critical in one 
article is made to feel that he owes a 
kindness next time. 


A final and overwhelming problem for 
New Haven reporters is one of time. 
Because the publishers are not overly 
anxious to do any investigative reporting 
or researched feature articles, they main-
tain their news staffs at just the size 
necessary to publish a daily paper. No one 
reporter can find the freedom to take off 
even one or two days from his daily re-
sponsibilities in order to research a non-
daily story. "I can't spare you," the city 
editor says, and in truth be can't: each 
editor must make do with the staff he is 
given. Consequently, most reporters put 
together a series or other extended articles 
in their spare time while still writing one 
or two daily pieces. 


Here Are 
Remarks Tlrat 
Tire Hippies 
Early last spring, with welfare promising 
to be a major issue in Hartford, I formally 
requested permission to research and write 
a series on welfare in New Haven: on the 
people, the costs and administrative 
problems. "I can't spare you from the 
beat," I was told, and the proposal sat 
through the end of the legislative session. 


In the face of these obstacles, most re-
porters eventually tire of trying to examine 
anything but the daily events. Investigating 
is just too much trouble. Reporters soon 
learn what the New Haven papers will 
tolerate and what they won't. After a few 
unsuccessful attempts, one knows it is 
useless to suggest, say, a broad article 
about ghetto problems in the winter (it 


didn't happen yesterday in a city agency), 
or about the massive defense and weapons 
industry in New Haven (that's inappropri-
ate .... ). 


Some reporters-the married, the middle-
aged, the New Haven natives, the 
not-so-disgruntled-remain at the paper, 
their own interests dulled, continuing to 
file the same daily articles about the same 
daily events or pseudo-events. But a con-
siderable number-the young and mobile, 
the ambitious or the idealistic-leave the 
New Haven papers. At the Journal-Courier 
in particular, where reporters tend to be 
younger and m01;:e independent, the turn-
over rate for reporters is comparable with 
the turnover of bus boys in a Times 
Square hamburger joint.

People who have never worked on a 
newspaper have no idea of the importance 
and influence of editors vis-a-vis reporters. 
A reporter writes the story, it is true; but 
an editor decides whether that story will 
appear on page one or page thirty-six, 
whether it will have a one-column or an 
eight-column headline, whether it will be 
cut to half its original length, or whether 
it will appear in the paper at all. 


Clark Kent had very little going for him 
until he started crashing phone booths-
it was Perry White who could raise 
Caesar's ghost. 


The editors at the New Haven papers-
all of them white-are not the urbane, 
tweedy Columbia Journalism School 
crowd. Many of them, after varying de-· 
grees of high school and college education, 
began with small-town Connecticut news-
papers or with the Register itself in the 
'40's and early '50's, when $80 a week was 
a fantastic salary and $40 not unthinkable. 
They worked their way up, as reporters 
and copyreaders, and at some point or 
other decided to make their career in New 
Haven. 


If reporters talk about principles, reality 
or truth, the editors look on these pre-
occupations as a strange product of the 
affluent sixties. What concerns the editors 
themselves is economic security and their 
position within the Register organization. 
' They are harassed, hard-working men, 
whose salaries sometimes seem inadequate 
for the early-morning or late-night 
work requried. 


There is a trace of anti-intellectualism 
among the editors. Any change is seen as a 
personal affront to Register-Courier edi-
tors who have come to look on the world 
as distasteful but immutable. "I don't 
know what this world is coming to," one 
editor said without amusement last spring. 


Along with the general suspicion 
towards change goes a deep mistrust of 
college students and black leaders. Stu-
dents-especially Yale students, because of 
their presumed social status-are seen as 
just a little bit crazy, and black leaders are 
considered far too demanding. What 
angers the editors most of all is self-
righteousness. The editors have decided 
that life is a grind of eating, sleeping and 
daily routine. Continual appeals to prin-
ciple and morality bother them, and they 
relish signs of hypocrisy among the 
moralists. The "newsmakers" whom they 
seem to admire most are the clever mani-
pulators, Lee and Adams, who-despite 
their designation as "liberals"-have 
learned to get along well with the editors 
in .their joint conception that life is a game 
and not a morality play. 


The problem is, of course, that not 
everyone in New Haven agrees. The news 
today deals constantly with injustice, 
inequality and exploitation, and a news-
paper is expected to evaluate conflicting 
claims about poverty, substandard 
housing, campus problems and discrimina-
tion. New Haven editors are not well 
equipped to cover these subjects. In many 
ways they are out of contact with the 
social problems of the day. 


The editors tend to live in the suburbs, 
away from the turbulence of inner-city 
schools, housing, redevelopment, crime, 
addiction and welfare. The roads which 
dislocated many people in New Haven are 
the ones which carry the editors to work 
from North Haven, Bethany and North 
Guilford. 


But an editor's place of residence does 
not fix his social outlook. Far more 
serious is the editor's failure to examine 
social iUs during working hours. The sad 
truth is that many New Haven editors 
rarely, if ever, have time to get out of the 
newsroom for a first-hand look at the city 
and its problems. Their jobs do not require 
such trips. They can and often must sit in 
the newsroom, day after day, editing copy, 
assigning reporters and writing headlines 
without ever once going out to look at the 
housing, to attend a Yale class or to talk 
with welfare recipients. In covering the 
Harvard strike last spring, I was surprised 
to find Boston editors there on the scene 
for observation: this never happened in 
New Haven. On local New Haven issues, 
too, the editorial writers rarely seemed to 
examine issues on their own. They simply 
read the news gathered by reporters and 
reacted to it. After months of controversy 
last winter, the editorial page discovered 
that the city has a housing problem. A 
group of editors and editorial writers sat 
down with ghetto leaders this summer for 
the first time-years after they should have. 


If the editors have authority, the 
business department has raw power. There 
are continual "requests" from the business 
staff. One former Courier city editor, now 
with the Washington Post, Leroy Arons, 
recalls, "The advertising department was 
in the newsroom every single night, eating 
away at our space. You got the general 
feeling that they dominated the news-
paper. They were an ever-present entity, 
and a powerful one." He remembers being 
asked to do stories on the news pages about 
such vital news events as supermarket 
openings.
