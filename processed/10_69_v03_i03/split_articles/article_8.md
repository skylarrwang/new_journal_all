**The Strength of Passions**
**Author: Not specified**
**Page number(s): 13**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The strength of passions from the primal 
horde which are stirred up in a particular 
seminar may vary with such factors as 
the age, rank or personality of the teacher. 
What logic makes it apply even in groups 
with relatively accepting, non-authori-
tarian teachers? The most important 
answer for psychoanalytic theory is that 
each new group situation involving 
authority figures inevitably stirs up ghosts 
of ancient childhood conflicts with parents. 
Like the ghosts of the Odyssey who arose 
and walked the earth when they tasted 
blood, the ghosts of parents, remembered 
from childhood, rise up and stand behind 
the chair of each new authority figure. 

There are many obvious ways in which 
professors cause themselves to be seen as 
authority figures. They act as gatekeepers 
for their discipline, organizing and ration-
ing knowledge and reading in weekly, 
prescribed doses. They determine what 
work is to be done to receive rewards from 
the university. They hold positions of 
status in the university and possibly 
in their field. 

But, even in more subtle ways, any 
teacher will often communicate that he is 
in charge. Often from habit, he takes the 
role of conferring legitimacy on speakers 
through acknowledging their raised 
hands. He dresses more formally than his 
students. By giving or withholding com-
ments he gives cues to his students about 
what remarks or behavior will be ap-
propriate. He usually sits at the head of 
the seminar table or at the front of the 
room, sometimes a bit removed from other 
seminar members. In this manner he may 
subtly create a self-fulfilling prophecy, 
acting as a father to his students and 
unconsciously adopting an approach 
similar to that of his own parents towards 
himself. 

~tudents, however, cannot be seen as 
unresponsible for perpetuating the prob-
lems of the primal horde in the seminar. 
They often sit so as to maneuver the pro-
fessor into the chair at the front of the 
room. They acceed to the professor's 
gatekeeping functions both as regards the 
subject matter and in controlling the 
seminar discussion itself. They think of the 
seminar as "the professor's" and if he 
fails to appear for a seminar meeting, they 
leave. Their ways of dealing with conflicts 
of power are partly circuitous and indirect: 
they try to "kill off" the formal and sepa-
rate authority of the university and 
incorporate professors and administrators 
into a "community;" they make evaluative 
comments on a "professor's" seminar to 
one another in private rather than face-
to-face with the professor while it is drag-
ging along. I have favored these efforts 
and have been a part of some of them in 
the past. But we are still avoiding the next 
step: openly exploring these issues as they 
continually manifest themselves, and 
inhibit, everyday life in the seminar. 

In examining our seminars we need not 
remain within the confines of the primal 
horde model. Drawing on the work of 
more recent analysts, and focusing on the 
erotic nature of learning and teaching, 
we might use the analogy of the teacher as 
a mother to stimulate new insight. The 
importance of women as authority figures 
in the home and in the early years of 
school suggests this train of thought might 
be a valuable supplement to the primal 
borde model. 

Using this analogy, depression in semi-
nars, as in Melanie Klein's work with 
children, might be diagnosed as arising 
from insufficient affection or nourishment, 
and the solution would be to provide 
the equivalent-in this case more of the 
professor's own feelings and exciting ideas · 
or perspectives, an approach which is often 
adopted. Lack of student commitment 
would be partly explained by erratic or 
insufficient involvement, eroticization and 
seductiveness by the professor (cf. the 
mothers in Keniston's The Uncommitted). 
It would also be partly explained if stu-
dents are embarrassed to be erotically 
involved in their subject matter. Since 
professors are usually male, inhibitions 
would also result as defenses against 
homosexual impulses (and associated 
latent fears of castration) stirred up by the 
professor's eroticization of the subject 
matter. 

The two psychoanalytic approaches to 
seminar life I have worked with probably 
are more useful for understanding the 
reactions of men than those of women. 
The psychoanalytic theories dealing with 
women are complex, and it would take 
another essay of equal or greater length to 
attempt to apply them. A full treatment 
would at least include the basic psycho-
analytic themes of the Electra complex, 
of feminine masochism and passivity and 
of narcissism. Also considered should be 
such intellectual and cognitive differences 
between the sexes as women's lesser 
capacity for abstraction and abstract 
reasoning and female perceptions of 
reality which include a lower awareness 
of conflict. What are the implications? 
Perhaps one is that women feel they will 
be better liked by the professor and other 
males if they remain passive and silent, 
forming a kind of "ladies auxiliary" and 
letting the men carry the discussion. 

My purpose in writing this essay, 
however, is not to convince other people 
to see our seminars as primal hordes, 
(although certainly they have looked like 
them in the past) or to see teachers as 
mothers or fathers, or both. My purpose is 
the opposite, in a very basic sense. The 
elements which realistically define our 
association and interactions with each 
other-voluntary choice, many shared goals 
and values, rules and procedures derived 
(more or Jess) by reason and discussion, 
the interdependencies of teaching and 
learning-are different from those which 
define the primal horde or the relations of 
families. The fact that Freud's model is 
applicable to how we have often behaved 
in the past in seminars is comically-and 
tragically-absurd. 

If a psychoanalytic perspective can help 
us to turn on the lights and dispel some 
ghosts, then we now have the possibility of 
seeing each other anew, unencumbered 
by conflicts from ·the past. We have the 
possibility of working together in our 
seminars to create a new and a better 
reality. Along this path, of course, lie the 
risks of greater openness and honesty, the 
uncertainties of questioning old patterns 
and habits. A number of realistic problems 
of emotional perspective must be grappled 
with by both professors and students. A 
professor may feel a responsibility to his 
discipline, to his students or (especially) 
to himself for organizing his treatment of 
the subject matter in a particular way. 
He may feel secure enough in his ability 
to work with groups, or trusting enough 
of the possibilities for group development, 
to allow a seminar to develop which may 
take on a life of its own and cooperatively 
set a course which might be different from 
that which he alone would select. He may 
not feel comfortable with informality. 
He may not believe that the "dragging 
seminar" is a barrier to important learning 
for his students. 

A student, too, faces conflicts in devel-
oping his approach to learning. He may 
admire his professor and believe that his 
greater experience makes dependence on 
him the recommended state of affairs. He 
may not know what he really wants or 
how he learns best. He may feel that other 
members of the seminar will not support 
initiatives on his part to examine and to 
restructure the functioning of the group. 
Graduate students, in particular, may fear 
to alienate those members of the faculty 
whose judgments and recommendations 
are important for their careers. 

These problems of emotional perspec-
tive are difficult to face and difficult to 
resolve. While many teachers, removed 
from their authoritarian and gatekeeper 
roles in experimental settings, find that 
their chief previous function bas been to 
inhibit a rather violent curiosity, many 
more teachers and students may simply 
prefer to play out their roles in traditional 
ways wbich are not, after all, complete 
failures. 

But if we can see each other anew, and 
if we do want something better, then the 
answer is to affirm our interdependence 
through action. In the past, students and 
professors have played out their roles in a 
mutual conspiracy in silence, either im-
potent to create an exciting seminar or 
stumbling onto the right formula almost 
by chance. The way to a new and a better 
reality involves a creative act in each of 
our seminars fed by the exploration and 
self-aware evaluation of the learning 
strategies best suited to the needs of group 
members and to the subject matter. It 
involves the building and testing of mutual 
trust and good-will. It involves a flair for 
adventure. We are in charge here; the 
quality of seminar life is ours to control.


**Journalistic Godawful**
**Page number(s): 14**

Journalistic godawful 
continued from page 11 
and getting news becomes even more 
difficult when Courier reporters write 
critically of the city administration. In late 
'68 and early '69, nearly all major state-
ments from Lee and Adams went to the 
Register, which seemed a bit more con-
trollable. 

Third and most important, the Courier 
and the Register had vastly different hiring 
policies. Development administrator 
Adams, next to Lee, the city's most ex-
perienced media-manipulator, once wryly 
noted, "The Journal-Courier has a wide 
range of people and ideas. The Register 
ranges from cautious to very cautious." 
Tightly controlled by the Jacksons, Leeny 
and McQueeny, the Register makes sure 
its reporters will nor rock the boat. Once 
promoted to one urban beat, they are left 
there for years at a time without rotation. 
Hence, they are very susceptible to the 
lure of developing compromising friend-
ships with the people and agencies they 
are supposed to cover. 

The hiring tradition goes back to the 
late '50's and early '60's, when managing 
editor Gerald Harrington hired journal-
ism-school graduates Arons and Shandler 
and other novices who turned out to be 
excellent reporters. (One of the reporters 
who worked under Harrington, Bill 
Guthrie, is now the Courier sports editor.) 
In recent years, the aggressive hiring was 
taken over by city editor Don Sharpe and 
(managing editor) Wallace. Sharpe, a 
quick, decisive, talented editor who some-
times shielded his reporters from the 
Jacksonian whimsy, managed to find or 
develop some excellent journalists: Bill 
Betsch, who dropped out of Yale to work 
full time under Sharpe, became the city's 
most pervasive questioner (it was Betsch's 
superb five-part series on Yale's property 
holdings, in September 1968, which trig-
gered the tax-exemption controversy); 
Bob Landers and Dyck Andrus, each hired 
by Sharpe after an Ivy League education 
and an unhappy stint in Vietnam, became 
the city's most readable and sardonic 
journalists. Landers in particular became 
a modern version of H. L. Mencken, 
tirelessly pursuing human folly in all 
corners of New Haven. 

Sometimes the differences between the 
two newspapers were embarrassingly 
noticeable. Last spring, Landers used his 
sources to write a number of articles about 
the various candidates who were being 
considered for the post of school super-
intendent. Tired of Landers's barbs, the 
New Haven Board of Education leaked 
its selection, Gerald Barbariesi, to the 
Register one afternoon. For the morning-
after story, under the headline "School-
Political Carnival," Landers skillfully put 
together a brilliant account showing how 
the mayor-who, as Landers phrased it, 
"shuns overt participation" in educational 
decisions-had manipulated the selection 
and the voting. At one point, Landers 
revealed, Lee had simply failed to appear 
at a cocktail party at which he was sup-
posed to meet an aspirant flown in from 
Illinois for the occasion. 

It was the best article to appear all 
spring. But the Register education reporter, 
Marion McDonald, a friend of the educa-
tion bureaucracy whose saccharine 
articles and Sunday column more often 
recall joy of milk and cookies than the 
problems of inner-city education, was 
greatly upset by Landers' article. She 
felt it was "improper" to report such . 
information. 

Unfortunately, however, the Courier 
was never quite so detached from its big 
sister as its maverick young reporters 
wanted to believe. Wages were still low, 
the staff was still too small to allow any 
time for work beyond the daily routine, 
the editorials were still unreal and one or 
two editors in just the wrong places were 
absurdly biased. Although hiring young 
reporters, the Courier lost them to larger 
newspapers or magazines. As the good-bye 
parties came ever faster, Sharpe, who had 
been upset with the long late hours and 
the constant turnover, last June accepted a 
position as editor of the Register Sunday 
magazine. The new city editor, Bob 
Granger, who bad been for years the sub-
urban editor of the Courier, was regarded 
as an unimaginative organization mao and 
a political superhawk. The next few 
months will probably determine whether 
the Courier can hold its· young reporters 
and its flashes of imaginative writing, or 
whether it will revert once again to the 
godawful. 

Local journalism is dying while local 
newspapers thrive. The power to report 
and interpret what happens in this country 
is being increasingly assumed by an 
oligopoly of national media: AP and UPI; 
· the New York Times, the Washington 
Post and their news services; Time and 
Newsweek, Life and Look; CBS and NBC. 
With elaborate expense accounts, their 
reporters move from airport to airport, 
nobly and desperately trying to say "what 
Woodstock means" in time for the six-
thirty news, the morning deadline or the 
weekly cover story. With few exceptions, 
their styles are as varied as the airports 
through which they pass. They are 
fashionably just-liberal, pensive but non-
committal, never too subjective or too 
passionate for their publications and net-
works. It is partially by contrast to them 
that Norman Mailer has seemed such an 
heroic journalist. 

NBC News recently said that because 
of the emerging national media, America 
had "discovered itself" for the first time 
in the 1960's. If that is so, the discovery 
was stunningly superficial. For while 
Washington committee hearings, Presi-
dential election campaigns, Woodstock, 
Chicago and the Moratorium are national 
events to be analyzed by national media, 
still, much which is important today-the 
delicate interaction of workers, blacks, 
suburbanites and students in each town 
and city-is too complicated and too 
localized for the national media to under-
stand. in a one- or two-day onslaught. Yet 
the local newspapers, defying change, 
discouraging and losing staff, have failed 
dismally to give perspective within their 
own bailiwicks. Consequently, to most 
ordinary people, "the news," meaning the 
national news, seems oddly distant and 
unreal, unlike anything which the local 
papers say is happening nearby. 

The failure of the New Haven papers is 
especially unfortunate, because everyone 
from Robert Dahl to Dick Lee and Ed 
Logue to AIM has looked on New Haven 
as the "urban microcosm," the small city 
which can easily be studied and which 
ought to be manageable. The Register 
and the Journal-Courier certainly do not 
Jack matters to ponder: for example, New 
Raven's increasing disillusionment with 
redevelopment and the anti-poverty pro-
gram; the increasingly different ways of 
life of the deserted city and the burgeoning 
suburbs; the faltering attempts of ana-
tional university and its students to define 
themselves locally. Instead of exploring 
such problems the papers have confined 
themselves to the routine and the familiar. 

Register columnist Frank Whalen wrote 
despairingly of the glib and facile inter-
pretations of New Haven by the national 
media after the 1967 disturbances: one 
might sympathize, had not the Register, by 
deciding not to ask questions of New 
Haven, forfeited its own chance. 

Unlike the local stores and industries 
which are also swept away in the process 
of nationalization, the local newspapers 
will not die out. They remain extremely 
profitable, because local advertising pours 
in, and because the television-watchers 
and the Times-readers will still, for a dime, 
buy the publication which gives them the 
movie schedules and the meeting times. 
They do not look to the local newspaper 
for understanding, and the local news-
paper does not care: to a newspaper which 
has already monopolized the local market, 
in-depth reporting and investigating work 
are at be~t a luxury and at worst a liability 
which might anger and lose readership. 

Local papers like the Register and the 
Journal-Courier have abdicated, and in 
doing so, they have become, in Cleaver's 
words, a part of the problem.


**Win Some, Lose Some**
**Author: George Kannar**

Win some, lose some 
continued from page 2 
Some reporter asked Cham pi why he 
didn't finish the season. Sure, you dropped 
a game to BU, but so what, everybody has 
a bad day (and Cham pi had had an 
extremely good one-or good 42 seconds 
worth of one-not too long ago). But 
Chart;J.pi said he would rather quit now 
than hurt the team by not caring, by "just 
going through the motions." 

"I just can't get myself psyched up 
for football any more," was the clincher. 
Marvel of marvels, wonder of wonders, 
ineffable joy of ineffable joys. We had won 
a small one. And they had lost. Champi, 
a senior, had caught it, whatever it is that 
is going around, whatever it is that is 
stopping people dead in their tracks, what-
ever it is that is turning them off to all the 
things they used to care about. And making 
them start to think about it all instead. 

So maybe there is a little hope after all. 
We lose a few-let the inspiring words of 
Miss America stand as a constant reminder 
of that-but little by little, here and there, 
we're winning a couple, too. Melvin 
Laird's son John participated in the 
October 15 Moratorium in Eau Claire, 
Wisconsin. And Frank Champi quit foot-
ball because it didn't make sense any more. 

It's too early to tell for sure yet, but 
maybe all we need is a couple more 
rebuilding years before we're ready to take 
them on again with more than a wobbly 
pass and a futile, muttered prayer.


**Blues**
**Author: Helen Robinson**

Blues 
For the most part, coeducation bas been 
good to us all. The boys are happy (or at 
least less unhappy), and the girls are pretty 
much on top of the world. That is, from 
Monday through Friday. But come the 
weekend .... 

I passed one small coterie of freshman 
women the other Friday afternoon at 
Phelps Gate, where freshman males used 
to gather to inspect the weekend's crop of 
women as they arrived from far and wide. 
The girls were sitting cross-legged on the 
grass, suspiciously eyeing weekend 
arrivals. It was easy to tell the difference: 
the Yale girls were clad in jeans and 
workshirts, the new arrivals in suits or 
dresses and "with paint on their faces," as 
one Yale miss put it in horrified tones. 

And it was easy to see bow welcome the 
new women were. The Yale girls looked 
each one over with the kind of cold stare a 
wife reserves for a mistress. Occasionally 
someone would look at the clean, scrubbed 
invaders and remind the others that, "Well, 
at least they won't look like that on 
Sunday." The other girls would laugh, but 
it did little to soothe their genuine 
annoyance at the aliens. They knew that 
weekends for them were not going to be 
like weekends for men; for their first time 
at Yale, they just weren't needed 
any more.


**Resurrection**
**Page number(s): 14-15**

Resurrection 
What happens to old churches when their 
time has come? Abandoned country rail-
road stations become antique shops and old 
banks become white elephants, but 
churches? God may well be dead, but 
somehow one hardly thinks about churches 
themselves dying at all, let alone being 
reincarnated afterwards. They just seem 
too eternally ecclesiastical. 

One church building that, happily, was 
not too set in its original ways to mind 
taking on a new identity is the old Calvary 
Baptist on Chapel Street. That church's 
congregation is moving, and the old 
building has become the new home of the 
Yale Repertory Theatre. 

It is the Yale Repertory's first exclusive 
home after years of sharing the University 
Theatr~ with undergraduates, and the 
restoration job is so good that it was worth 
the wait. The building still looks like a 
church, but the touch of Drama School 
Dean Robert Brustein-and that of theatre 
engineer George Izenour who was in 
charge of the conversion project-is evi-
dent. The front doors of the building are 
bright "Brustein red," and banners hang 
from the outside walls. Inside, an ample 
stage fills the former pulpit area, and 
runways lead into the audience. The 
superb physical facilities were used to their 
utmost in the Repertory Theatre's first 
production of the year, "The Rivals" (a 
play that would be worth seeing for itself 
even if it weren't in a theatre that is worth 
seeing for itself), and the overall effect is 
one of-well, to be honest, the overall effect 
is one of a church beautifully redone as a 
theatre. 

It would all be perfect save for one 
thing. The days are already numbered for 
the Drama School's new pride and joy: 
the old church is one of several buildings 
on the block slated for demolition in 
1971 prior to construction of the Mellon 
Gallery of British Art. Opponents of the 
Gallery have often attacked the plans as 
destroying a lively and interesting New 
Haven block. In fact, most of the block is 
undistinguished and would not be missed. 
Only now, with the c<>mpletion of this 
new and imaginative theatre, does the 
block possess a valuable resource. 

But it looks as though all-knowing 
planners will have their way and the 
church will die anyway, despite its success-
ful new lease on life. Maybe its bricks 
will go to heaven.
