Comment: Fighting the war, fighting the world, fighting the women and saving a church.
Fiction died today, or maybe it was yesterday. No, maybe it was October 15. A novel about a nation opposed to a war it is waging and whose President states he will not be swayed by public opinion because it is not in the public interest, wouldn't even make it at Woolworth's. What English professor would pass a short story about a New Haven peace. convocation that opens to the strains the Yale Marching Band's "March, March on Down the Field," followed closely by "Bulldog, Bulldog, Bow wow wow"? 

"Anyone who doesn't buy a flag ain't a good American." Grey stubble, short, old, worn trench coat, prunified body. OK, he carried flags and evenÂ·hawked long yellow and green plastic horns, but at least he had the honesty to admit it was a carnival. 

"If you're such a good American, why don't you give away the flags for free?" 
Wants to impress friends. Light-brown cashmere sweater, matching brogues, cries out male chauvinism every time a hairy hand beats her to the Russian dressing. 

The band strikes up "When the Saints Go Marching In," the speakers' platform begins to fill and ASTOUNDING: everyone on the platform, as if waiting for the 8:50 express, wears the same shade of grey business suit, (except Robert Lifton who dissents with olive green). There are even, count 'em, two Negroes. 

And then, the anathema of every. hard working bureaucrat, a lapse of planning. Glen DeChabert, a black, forces his way to the podium in a last ditch effort to inject some note of reality. He succeeded, even if we didn't hear his words. Mikes shut off, student apparatchiks, armed with some misguided sense of responsibility, tried to strongarm him off the stage, until some question was raised as to who in fact bad the monopoly on bad taste. 

If one were to read Catch 22 today, he would see it only as that mythic longing for the golden past. 

The October 15 Moratorium was the largest national effort to date to end the war. The peace convocation on the Green was the largest anti-war rally in New Haven's history. For the first time, the leaders of the effort to end the war were the official leaders of the Yale and New Haven Community. 

Only two years ago, on the David Susskind Show, Kingman Brewster stated that if he woke up as President of the US at 9:00 tomorrow morning he would not know what to do. Today the New Haven Register has grouped him with other "left wing campus manipulators." Who knows, tomorrow's Register might have his mug shot, along with AI Lowenstein, Richard Lee, Joe Duffy, Ella Grasso, and Stuart Udall, with a banner headline announcing their arrest for conspiracy. 

For the anti-war effort, the Moratorium was a tremendous success. In terms of the Yale community, the most important moment was when the president of the University took a personal stand against the war, joining his fellow faculty members and students in a common effort to restore the faded sense of the university as a moral conscience of a screwed-up nation. 

Either/Or. Perhaps a better title would be Neither/Both.
