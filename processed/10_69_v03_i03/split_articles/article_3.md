Fat Bernie: keeping Gotham's gossip grinding
Information about Fat Bernie, the well-known New York gossip plugger (see The New Journal; October 29, 1967) has dried up at Yale since Contributing Editor David Freeman left the Drama School a year ago. We've located Freeman in New York where he's re-established contact with Bernie. 

The following is his report. 
Coppleman called Fat Bernie at 7:45 Friday morning to complain about the Dustin Hoffman item in Earl Wilson's Thursday column: 
"Gotham's newest rider on a superstar-ship, Dustin (Midnight Cowboy/ The Graduate) Hoffman has refused two major H'wood offers to work in NYC-seems Dusty can't leave his analyst long enough to go to sunland." 

Fat Bernie placed that item with Wilson a week ago, and when it hadn't appeared by Wednesday, he figured it was dead. The call from Coppleman, the analyst in question, and the early hour caught him off balance. 
"You will forgive the hour, Mr. Gersten; however, this is my only free time." 
"It's OK." 
"I am calling in reference to the column of Mr. Earl Wilson in the New York Post of yesterday afternoon." 
"What item?" 
"Regarding Mr. Dustin Hoffman." 
"Oh yeah." 
"Mr. Gersten, I as well as my colleagues consider it highly unethical, not to mention irresponsible, to make public information of such a highly intimate and confidential nature." 
"Why you calling me?" 
"Mr. Wilson tells me you are his agent in such matters. Information about a patient's psychic state is extremely confidential, as well as potentially volatile." 
"You called Wilson?" 
"Yes-" 
"This morning already?" 
"Yes, his anxiety level, Mr. Gersten, is already dangerously high-" Fat Bernie let out a slow whistle and considered Earl Wilson, who never gets up before noon, being awakened at 7:30. "-not to mention an acute distress. I would like to know, Mr. Gersten, how you are privy to such information?" 
"Was he mad?" 
"I think a more accurate description might be acutely distressed." 
"Did he say anything about me?" 
"I don't believe he is aware you were involved in this matter. I learned of your-" 
"Wilson?" 
"No, no. I am referring to Mr. Hoffman. I would not presume to offer a diagnosis of Mr. Wilson's anxiety level without an initial interview at the very least." 
"Yeah, but when you woke him up-Wilson-was he mad? Acutely distressed or anything?" 
"It was difficult to tell. I'm not certain that I did wake him. But more to the point-" 
"If you called him already this morning you woke him. And he was mad." 
"Be that as it may, the point is, I need to know your sources." 
"You mean about Hoffman?" 
"Yes." 
"I don't know. I guess I heard it around." 
"Mr. Gersten, I would like to point out to you that the nature of a doctor-patient relationship is extremely confidential, not to mention delicate." 
"Well, he's gotta learn how to get along with the press if he's gonna be a star." 
"Bandying about half-truths regarding that relationship is dangerous to both patient and doctor." 
"The Press's first obligation is to the truth." 
"And I suspect its second obligation is to sensationalism. We will, however, overlook the entire incident if you can assure me you'll declare a moratorium on news concerning my patient's psychic state. I hope Mr. Hoffman's attornies will be as forgiving." 
"Well news is news, but we don't want to hurt anybody's feelings, so I guess it wouldn't hurt if I check with you for a medical opinion before we run anything on Hoffman. How's that?" 
"Excellent. Now if you'll excuse me, my first patient is due." 
"Who's that?" 
"I beg your pardon?" 
"The first patient?" Fat Bernie reached over to the table next to his bed and groped for his notebook. "I wondered if it was anybody in show business?" 
"Mr. Gersten, my work is extremely confidential." 
"Do you have any other stars for clients?" 
"As a matter of fact several of my patients are from the entertainment world. As you may know, the theatre creates a great many pressures-" 
"You handle Tennessee Williams?" 
"My clients, I mean patients, are primarily performers." 
"What's your first name Doctor?" 
"Alois, however, I fail-" 
"That's A-L-?" 
"A-L-O-I-S." 
"How do you spell your last name?" 
"C-O-P-P-L-E-M-A-N." 
"What about Sammy Davis? You handle him? Zero Mostel? Who else besides Hoffman?" 
"That's none of your business." 
"But if I know, then I can check all the time with you, so we don't have this problem again." 
"Mr. Gersten, I must get back to my work." 
"How much do you charge?" 
"That is confidential information." 
"More than seventy-five dollars an hour? Just say yes or no." 
"Yes. No. My first patient is arriving. Good-bye." 
"Davis or Mostel?" 

Dr. Coppleman hung up and Fat Bernie sank back into bed, smoothing his red, size fifty-six short, Sulka pajamas and waited for an angry call from Wilson. As he dozed he phrased Coppleman items in his mind: 

What famous young actor has his analyst begging the Press to lay off? The Doc sez 'It's rough on my boy, so come on fellas, take it easy.' 
Or, he might kick it .off with the Doctor: 
Dr. Alois Coppleman, the seventy-five-dollars an-hour-plus shrink to the stars (Dustin Hoffman etc.) has asked for a let-up on re-ports of the mental state of one of our town's most famous.
