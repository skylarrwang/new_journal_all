of the administrative forces are for 
immediate visibility," he says, "but I want 
to see the formal program emerge out of 
informal programs. I'm against instant 
experimentation. It tends to play down the 
guy who's really good and is committed to 
a certain thing. My value is primarily at 
the level of teaching poems." 

A noisy fight over Pass/Fail dominated 
most of all the last year at Santa Cruz. 
Berger opposed that system because he 
feels it allows sloppy academics to take an 
easy way and also because Santa Cruz per-
mits secret evaluations in locked files. 

Berger himself is engaged in a number 
of projects. He hopes to finish writing a 
book on Edmund Spenser by the end of 
the year. In the meanwhile, he bas also 
become interested in the theatrical 
mediom, in the different relations among 
actors and characters and spectators that 
pushes the writer from the foreground. He 
wants to explore the theatrical experience 
as a model of human experience. His 
lecture on The Tempest grew out of his 
realization that Shakespeare's last plays do 
not seem to be made for the theater, that 
they seem even anti-theatrical. 

In addition, Berger is also working on 
two other sets of studies. The first has to do 
with period imagination, what makes the 
imagination of one time different from 
those that preceeded it. He's also doing a 
set of studies on archaism and revisionism, 
how writers relate to their predecessors. 

Maynard Mack's allegorical introduc-
tion of Berger at the lecture, which had 
moved from the Graduate School to the 
Law School auditorium to accommodate 
the large turn-out, was graceful and 
affecting but emphasized Berger as the 
ingenuously brash young man. This, how-
ever, no longer fits Berger. He's now a 
senior man and one of the main movers in 
a new department at a campus which soon 
could be one of the most exciting in the 
nation. 

Berger was at Yale for three days. In 
some ways, it was clear, he missed Yale; it 
was also clear, from the steady flow of 
visits, phone calls and invitations, that a lot 
of people miss Harry Berger. They wanted 
to see him, to ask him what he's doing. Ber-
ger came up to New Haven from the 
University of North Carolina at Chapel 
Hill, where he's spending a semester's 
leave from Santa Cruz. He teaches one 
course at Chapel Hill, but he spends 
much of his time sitting in the backyard, 
reading Edmund Spencer under the warm 
sun.
