praise for melding the diverse elements of 
Dark of the Moon into a unified whole 
which can be talked about as such. Indeed 
it is only on ground of interpretation that 
we can take any legitimate exception to 
this almost flawlessly executed production. 
Dark of the Moon seems to ask a simple 
question of its director: is it primarily a 
tragic play with pronounced comic ele-
ments or just the reverse? Dark of the 
Moon is conventionally produced as a 
tragedy. Mr. Starnes has taken the far 
more difficult course of producing the 
play as a dark comedy, and of contrasting 
its humorous elements with the somber 
background of witchcraft, of curse and 
retribution, of death, sexual license and 
reliJious bigotry aginst which the action 
unfolds. This interpretation, however, has 
the built-in danger that the play will give 
the impression not so much of humor as 
of frivolity. And indeed this is a short-
CO.Jl)ing of the present production, in which 
the unsophisticated mountain folk have an 
unhappy way of deteriorating into mind-
less hicks. Mr. Starnes' attempt to evoke a 
simple primitive world too often de-
teriorates into an unintential and some-
what condescending parody of a tragedy 
in which the actors laugh at the characters 
they portray and nobody takes the thing 
very seriously. 


The first act is primarily at fault; for 
here Mr. Starnes bas delineated his char-
acters in broad strokes, an attempt at bold 
caracterization with the unfortunate side 
effect of obscuring the subtle analogies 
between acts one and two. The unalerted 
playgoer will fail to see, for example, that 
the pivotal scene at the hoedown in act 
one is an almost exact-if unexpected-
foreshadowing of the scene at the revival 
meeting in the second act which culminates 
in the ritual rape that precipitates the final 
tragedy. And for all Mr. Starnes' fascina-
tion with choral speech and gestures in 
unison he does not sufficiently emphasize 
t?e fact that the square dance is itself a 
ntua), a profane version, as it were, of the 
sacred ritual of the religious revival. 


Ultimately the question of whether the 
.play is a comedy or a tragedy is misleading. 
DGT/c of the Moon turns out to be primarily 
a study in ironic perceptions, of how the 
COmplexity of human experience evades 
all attempts at simple explanation. The 
world of the play is defined in terms of 
Various stereotypes of the range of human 
~havior, running from hoedown tore-
VIVal meeting, out of which the various 
characters manufacture inadequate ex-
planations of their own motivations and 
the meaning of their own lives. 


Indeed, the plot of Dark of the Moon 
IS ttself a descant on a commonplace, the 
story of the demon lover, one of the 
darkest of romantic stereotypes. Ostensibly 
DGT/c of the Moon tells of the plight of 
~arbara Allen, an innocent maiden who 
~ attacked and raped by a witch, who 
ter marries him and bears his child, 
and who is ultimately reclaimed by means 
of the simple faith of good country people. 
The truth, it transpires, is not so simple, 
nor are the country people so good. Both 
the mountain girl and the witch boy, who 
are the only characters in the play able 
to tran.cend the limitations of their re-
worlds. are destroyed by the 
~ 
whose conventions they have 


ODe may fault this present production of 
~of 
the M oon, then, for its failure to 
ev 
that ambiguous mood which gives 
~play much of its emotional charge. 
l1 l'erbaps too straightforward in its 
conception; but in execution this Dramat 
production merits the highest praise. It is 
skillful without pretentiousness and, best 
of all, allows us to focus our attention 
undividedly upon the play.
