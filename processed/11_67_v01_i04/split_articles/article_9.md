"Don't forget," he added, "Joe worked 
on his own escape, that novel, for over 
eight years." 

When rave reviews started coming in, 
Heller took to carrying them around at 
work. He became so excited about Brus-
tein's review in theN ew Republic that 
he told friends Brustein probably wrote 
better than he did. Heller signed countless 
books for McCall's people, but he never 
gave anyone free copies. He chided people 
who brought their copies discounted from 
Korvette's. But he treated friends to lunch 
if they promised to check how the book 
was selling at nearby book stores. 

His business friends found it difficult 
to believe he had actually written Catch-
2 2. "C'mon Joe," they would say to him. 
"A few of the jokes, maybe yes, but not 
the whole book. You don't have that kind 
of tragic sense." 

In November, 1961, two weeks after 
publication date, Brustein and Heller met 
for the first time at the home of the Village 
Voice art critic. Heller was so thrilled 
about going to parties and meeting famous 
people during this time that it took him 
months to catch on that parties had been 
thrown so that people could meet him. He 
was the guest of honor. 

That night, Heller talked about things 
he'd been through in the army. He talked 
about being so high in the clouds that when 
you hit a bridge, you couldn't tell if there 
were people on it or not. 

Heller took a leave of absence from 
McCall's a few months after Catch-22 was 
published, and he never returned. During 
the next five years he wrote critical and 
autobiographical articles for national mag-
azines, went to Hollywood to write the 
"polish" (the final script) for "Sex and the 
Single Girl", worked on his next novel 
which he predicts will be finished in the 
next two to twelve years, and toured col-
lege campuses speaking and reading from 
Catch-22. 

Catch-22 was translated into 121an-
guages, became a best seller in countries 
like England and Czechoslovakia, and 
sold more than 3,500,000 copies. Heller 
sold an option unti11969 on the production 
rights to Columbia Pictures for a reported 
$150,000. 

Heller is not interested, he says, in 
whether the book is ever made into a 
movie. Filming may begin this summer. 
Mike Nichols was slated some time ago to 
direct the movie. Alan Arkin was chosen 
as the movie's star. 

It was while Heller was doing reading 
and speaking tours on Catch-22 that be 
conceived of having four actors and an 
actress do readings from Catch-22 plus 
source readings from Shakespeare from 
which a surprising number of Catch-22 
passages derive. 

"Sort of readings and misreadings from 
Shakespeare," was the way Heller des-
cribed his plan to a Film ways executive 
who had bought production rights from 
Columbia. 

But as Heller began to look for a device 
to give his play more form, be decided to 
drop Catch-22, which was becoming a 
burden, and to write an original play. His 
first draft contained Falstaff's speech on 
honor among other Shakespearean pas-
sages, most of which have been cut from 
the final draft. 

At this point, late last fall, Heller came 
to Yale to give a talk at Calhoun College, 
during which be described himself as "a 
born promotion man." 

"He's incredible," was the reaction of 
one Yale student after Heller's speech. 
"He comes on like a real Madison A venue 
fat cat with that born promotion man 
business. If I were the author of C atch-22, 
I'd bill myself as a born American author." 

The next night, Heller bad dinner with 
the Brusteins at their home. During dinner 
he discussed his idea for the play. Brustein 
was very excited and encouraged Heller 
to get to work on it. 

The first draft of the first half of the 
first act appeared in Brustein's mail along 
with an outline of the rest of the play 
about a month later. As soon as he read it, 
Brustein realized that Heller had obviously 
thought much more deeply about the play 
than he had let on when they had talked 
about it. 

After four more months of hard work. 
Heller sent Brustein the second draft of 
the whole play. Brustein read it and be-
came so excited by the last act that he read 
it first to his wife, and was still so excited 
that he called Philip Roth long distance 
and read it to him. 

Brustein then invited Heller to be Play-
wright-in-Residence for this semester and 
contracted for Yale Drama School to pro-
duce the first production of We Bombed 
In 
. (The title changes each 
time the play is produced in a different 
city.) Thus the play would be known first 
as We Bombed in New Haven. 

The first public reading of the play in 
late October was a smash hit. The actors 
read it before the entire drama school. At 
the play's end, Heller himself was among 
those moved to tears. 

One student said he didn't see how the 
play could ever be better. Many agreed 
they bad never beard a first reading so 
good. The actors sounded so natural that 
people kept referring back to their scripts 
to make sure they weren't improvising. 

After the reading, Larry Arrick, the 
director, fresh from the off-broadway pro-
duction of Fragments by Murray Schisgal, 
asked students to go and come quietly 
from rehearsals without disturbing the 
cast. He also asked them not to sit back 
and snipe and criticize. 

Then Heller, joking in his best Catch-22 
style, told students they could make as 
much noise as they wanted at rehearsals, 
and for God's sake, if they bad any critic-
ism, please speak up. 

That day, Heller remembered all the 
reasons he had decided to open his play in 
New Haven. Without Brustein's encour-
agement, first of all, there might not have 
been a play at all. Also he viewed his first 
play as an educational experience. He bad 
felt that at Yale he would have the most 
creative freedom to develop and change 
his script. 

"The pressure here at Yale," he told his 
playwriting class while he loosened his tie 
and unbuttoned the top two buttons on 
his shirt, "would never be as bad as New 
York where every jerk you meet wants to 
change your script." 

We Bombed in New Haven went into 
rehearsal October 30, inside the dark, 
deserted, and often chilly, old WNHC 
building on Chapel Street. 

After one rehearsal Heller was a ner-
vous wreck. He told his playwriting stu-
dents about a night of fitful sleeping at the 
Midtown Motor Inn, tossing and turning 
in anguish over what he bad seen at re-
he~sal. All night long, maniacs on either 
side of his room banged walls and played 
radios. At 5 a.m. a distraught Heller dis-
covered that, in fact, the radio built into 
his own night table had been on all night. 

Heller was now having trouble remem-
bering the reasons be had brought his play 
to Yale. He had just been told that the 
actors would not be able to rehearse on 
stage with props and correct spacing until 
four days before opening night, because 
the stage was being used by undergraduates 
and the San Francisco Mime Troupe. 

And Stacy Keach, the star of We Bombed 
In New Haven, would not be able to at-
tend the first week and a half of rehearsals. 
"They've been rehearsing a different 
play all this week," Heller said, "It's called 
Waiting For Stacy." 

Heller was also shattered after the first 
rehearsal to find his stage directions 
ignored, vebal emphases changed, jokes 
lost, and continuity continually disrupted. 
Lines were dragging that Heller bad 
envisioned as fast repartee. If an actor 
would say a line as Heller had envisioned 
it, he would heave a sigh and think, great 
he's got it. But ten minutes later in another 
run-through of the same scene, the actor 
would say the line completely differently. 

"I can't understand it," Heller told his 
playwriting students. "Maybe I just better 
stay away from rehearsals for my own 
peace of mind, my own sanity." 

The young playwrights had almost all 
been through bad moments like these. 
They told Heller that the best thing he 
could do would be to stop going to rehears-
als, until right before the play opened. 
They assured him that things always 
spring into shape during final rehearsals 
with or without the then-broken figure of 
the playwright. 

Heller agreed and seemed to cheer up. 
But he decided to go to one more re-
hearsal. 

After rehearsal number two, he told his 
students, huddled in a dark corner watch-
ing the play through a glass window, that 
Anthony Holland and Ron Liebman were 
adding new comic levels and texture to 
the characters they played. 

Â· "I'm learning. I'm learning," said Heller 
later that day on the train, "that I wrote a 
script not a production. In novels, the 
writer defines and limits his characters, but 
not in plays. If an actor has any talent and 
is working with a good director, he will fill 
out bare words in the script." 

But the play was still making HeUer very 
nervous. He decided to stay away for two 
weeks, cross his fingers, and hope every-
thing would come out all right. 

"Otherwise," be said weakly," I think 
there will have to be some unpleasantness." 

But Heller. couldn't stay away for two 
weeks. He was back one week later for 
Stacy Keach's first rehearsal. After the 
rehearsal, he was joking, but he was still 
very upset. 

"Listen, who's nervous," be said, "I'm 
a veteran of the theater now. After two 
weeks experience I've learned a lot. I've 
learned to suffer excruciating torture with-
out making a sound while they blow my 
play." 

But Heller was feeling better. Heal-
lowed as how he was beginning to like the 
theater. He was even beginning to take 
actors seriously after a long evening with 
Ron Liebman. 

But Heller had a new worry. In the week 
that he was gone, the Major had developed 
a southern accent. Heller said, "I don't 
like the Major with a southern accent. I 
don't want the audience to think be's 
supposed to be Johnson. By projection the 
play is about the Viet Narn war. Specifi-
cally, it's about a very unspecific war." 

"The Major is supposed to be as sinister 
and mysterious as fate or destiny or God. 
I don't want him to be turned into a south-
ern jingoist." 

What will you do after this play, asks a 
student. 

"I don't have a work compulsion, I don't 
have to write plays or novels. What're you 
laughing about, Allan? I had one when I 
was your age, but I don't have one any-
more. I just want to write a good novel or 
a play once in a while. I can make enough 
money to live doing movie polishes. I can 
get a certain amount of satisfaction from 
doing that. I don't always have to be doing 
great art." 

One can understand. Catch-22 and Wt 
Bombed in New Hawm are both about 
war, but beyond that they're about the 
fragility and vulnerability of people, about 
the wars that people wage against other 
people and against themselves. When you 
see and feel this evil, as Heller did over 
A vignon, you will never forget it, but you 
can't take the pain of constantly facing it. 

Interviewer: "Isn't it a funny feeling that 
so many people you don't even know 
were so moved by your book and will 
also be moved by your play? 
Heller: "Not a funny feeling. It's a good 
feeling. See that guy over there (He 
points to a man across the aisle eating 
soup and engrossed in a paperback.) 
When my book first came out in paper, 
I'd get into the subway or train and look 
at the books people were reading. If the 
paperback bad blue edges, it was Dell. 
My book is in Dell, so then I'd have to 
try to see the cover. If the guy was readÂ· 
ing my book, it was a good feeling."
