support he received in Orange County, 
and other areas which share its faith, 
carried the former actor into the California 
statehouse in 1966, and on into the contest 
for the American Presidency in 1968. 

One way to understand the phenomenon 
of Ronald Reagan is by exploring the 
political culture of the 800 square mile 
county that made him possible. 
"The important thing to know about 
Southern California," Harvard's political 
scientist James Q. Wilson has written, 
"is that the people who live there-who 
grew up there-love it. Not just the way 
one has an attachment to a hometown, any 
hometown, but the way people love the 
realization that they found the right mode 
of life." 

With its semi-tropical climate, 2500 
acres of public beaches, its boat harbors 
and its booming economy, the county has 
become the fastest growing area in the 
country. Once a great expanse of orange 
trees and agricultural communities, it is 
now urban sprawl-freeways, shopping 
centers and tract homes-
key real estate 
in the megalopolis that spreads from Santa 
Barbara south 200 miles to San Diego 
along the Southern California coast. 

Between 1950 and 1966, Orange County's 
population increased 500 percent, from 
216,000 to over 1 ,200,000. 

Almost everybody in Orange County 
bas a well-paying job, either as a white 
collar worker or as a h ighly skilled tech-
nician with General Dynamics, North 
American Aviation, Autonetics, or any 
one of the many aerospace firms in the 
county. Everyone owns or is paying for 
his house, most in large commercial tracts, 
heralded by highway billboards announc-
ing such messages as "When You're Here, 
You've Arrived." 

Two cars are a minimum; pleasure boats 
are common. In fact, people in Orange 
County spend more money on more things 
than practically anyone else in America. 
Furniture, for example, is often purchased 
by the roomful, rather than in individual 
pieces. The area is the shopping center 
capital of the world. There are more 
supermarkets along Harbor Blvd. in Costa 
Mesa than in all of New Haven. 

Le Corbusier, the architect, could have 
been thinking of Orange County one night 
at a New York dinner party, when he 
took his napkin and on it sketched a 
square. He then drew a rectangle in the 
lower left-band comer for a door, a 
window in the upper right, and a string of 
smoke emerging from a chimney on top. 
Handing the sketch to his dinner partner, 
be exclaimed: "Voila! The American 
Dream!" 

Orange County is for its residents the 
fulfillment of the American Dream. The 
governor typifies their way of life: 
prosperous, independent, clean. One 
result is an energetic kind of civic pride. 
It was a great day for the county, for 
instance, when in 1963 the Bureau of 
Census officially designed it a "Standard 
Metropolitan Statistical Area," distinct 
from Los Angeles. Two years later the 
Anaheim Stadium was constructed and the 
requisite major league baseball team 
arrived shortly thereafter. 

Related to the achievement of the 
American dream are suggestions of the 
American frontier, with its rugged in-
dividualism. There is also a trace of 
anxiety, a concern that the Pream may 
be ruined by the intrusion of alien forces. 
Orange County is literally a frontier. 
Until recently, most of its land was par-
celled among a few large ranches, which 
came originally from Spanish land grants. 
Over 60,000 acres of the Irvine Ranch 
(second only to Texas' King Ranch in size 
and wealth) is still used for agriculture. In 
the last few years, however, the developers 
have carved out entire towns--even a 
branch of the University of California-
on the rolling hills where cattle used to 
graze. 

"Frontierland," one of Disneyland's 
main attractions, serves as a metaphor for 
the ideal life-style Orange Countians 
admire. Assembled there is Hollywood's 
version of the frontier: shooting galleries, 
the Mark Twain paddle-wheel steamer, 
pack mules, keel boats, Indian war canoes, 
and a frontier trading post. 

Even more representative of this kind 
of nostalgia is Knott's Berry Farm, not 
far from Disneyland. Knott's Berry Farm, 
where the asphalt sticks to your shoes like 
chewing gum on a hot August day, was 
the area's first tourist attraction. It is 
today the spiritual heart of Orange County. 
Walter Knott bas constructed there not 
only an Indian trading post, but also a 
covered wagon camp, a Calico gold mine, 
an operating stage coach route and an 
imitation ghost town. Each day, visitors 
can see a real live shoot-'em-up gunfight 
on the streets of the Old West. 

Knott erected these replicas on land 
where berries once grew; he did it with 
proceeds from the sale of Mrs. Knott's old-
fashioned strawberry jam, which still sells 
widely. The family venture itself is an 
example of self-made success. 

The rugged individuals who populate 
the area, like their mythical forebears, 
are not bound by social convention. Only 
in Orange County can traffic violators 
appear in municipal court shoeless or 
shirtless, taking time out from the beach, 
and be received by the judge with 
eq uanirnity. 

There are several manifestations of 
individualism. The media is geared to 
personalities, like the abrasive Joe Pyne, 
who hurls epithets ("Go gargle with razor 
blades") to the parade of victims who 
appear on his weekly television talk show. 

The Pacific Ocean is part of another 
kind of individualism. Surfing and boating 
are popular partly because they represent 
a confrontation between man and nature. 
Legions of young people travel with their 
boards to take the big waves, or to test 
their body surfing skills at "The Wedge," 
in Newport Beach, where it has not been 
uncommon for swimmers to emerge with 
broken arms and legs. A few have been 
killed. 

As with the pioneers on the frontier, 
survival and success depend upon the ski.ll. 
ingenuity and daring of the individual. The 
logical extension of this attitude is the 
fundamentalist capitalism which predom-
inates in the county. The most prominent 
and most extreme advocate of this position 
is the Santa Ana Register, which is well to 
the right of Adam Smith. The largest news-
paper in the area. emanating from the 
county seat itself, it is part of a chain of 
"Freedom Newspapers," owned by R. C. 
Hoiles, an archconservative octogenarian 
who might almost be classified as an an-
archist. 

Not only does Hoiles object to govern-
ment financing of schools, be believes that 
it should not even provide fire protection: 
that task is better left to privately-owned 
insurance companies. The enormous and 
widespread prosperity of the area, seem-
ingly achieved individually, makes this 
philosophy of pristine laissez-faire attrac-
tive to the citizens of Orange County. It is 
validated by their own experience. 

With all their concern for old-time 
individualism, the settlers of the Orange 
County frontier are citizens in exile. They 
sense that they are cut off from their roots, 
and compensate by a concerted super-
Americanism. The county is reminiscent 
of the British communities in the overseas 
colonies, whose members drank more tea, 
played more cricket and were generally 
more English than anyone at home. 

In the same way, coffee shops in Orange 
County proclaim adherence to "the prin-
ciples of Americanism," gas stations fly 
the Stars and Stripes, and the Pledge of 
Allegiance is chanted at every opportunity. 
There is also a great interest in the Revolu-
tionary War period of American history, 
and the interest extends beyond the 
rhetorical invocation of the Founding 
Fathers. The pride of Knott's Berry Farm 
is a brick-by-brick replica of Independence 
Hall in Philadelphia. 

Part of the tour of the hall is a recorded 
re-enactment of the debate over the pro-
posal to declare independence in the 
Second Continental Congress in a facsimile 
of the room where it took place. The de-
bate sounds familiar. It is carried on in the 
terminology of today's controversy over 
Viet-Nam. The "nervous nellies" who 
oppose a forthright stand for independence 
whine for a "limited war," and a "ne-
gotiated settlement." The bold visionaries 
on the other side insist that compromise 
is impossible, and urge "support for our 
boys who are in the field fighting." 

Thus it is clear that the Founding 
Fathers would have agreed with the 
citizens of Orange County on Viet-Nam, 
just as they would have agreed on Medi-
care, welfare and active government. 

Easterners (and particularly Northern 
Californians) are scornful of the political 
ideology of Orange County, which seems 
to them Blimpish, priggish, reactionary in 
the worst sense, and dangerously over-
simplified. Perhaps so. On the other hand, 
the politics of the county can be justified 
on the basis of its collective experience. 
By the simple act of moving to California, 
the people there have attained the Good 
Life. Therefore it follows that anyone of 
enterprise, no matter what his background 
or color, can attain it-and anybody who 
doesn't is inferior or lazy. 

And thisÂ· Good Life was achieved with 
absolutely no assistance from the govern-
ment. Therefore, the government is little 
more than a group of self-serving hacks, 
as Ronald Reagan observed, who have 
no right to claim a share of the prosperity, 
especially not for the purpose of redis-
tributing it among loafers. Any challenges 
to this way fo life-communism or its 
hand-maiden, big government-must be 
resisted. The Good Life, above all, was 
achieved by the American Way, which 
originated somewhere around 1776, and 
was cultivated on the frontier during"the 
19th century. 

The political faith of Orange County, 
then, is not complicated. Prosperity is 
achieved by the efforts of the individuals, 
in a society free of government fetters. 
Americans must protect this freedom, 
otherwise the prosperity may disappear. 
Ronald Reagan, who believes this, has 
been chosen as Protector. 

But this view of the world is not withott 
flaws. The attitude that Orange County's 
prosperity is independent of government 
intervention is not true. It is the governÂ· 
ment which has subsidized the aerospaa 
companies, built the freeways, educated 
the children, sponsored four large milita!l 
installations which fuel the county's 
economy, and brought water in from the 
north and east to irrigate the land. 

Further, the world-wide view of these 
citizens is unabashedly superficial. The 
capsule creed of Walter Knott, which is 
predominantly displayed in his Freedom 
Book Store, is: "We oppose Communism 
Naziism, Fascism, and all otb"er forms of 
Socialism." 

And finally, Orange County has becolll! 
a disturbing fulfillment of the American 
Dream. When everybody has a Le Cor-
busier dream-house in the suburbs, and 
when everybody has his own car and can 
go anywhere he pleases, the result is a 
huge ticky-tacky residential sprawl, with 
no organizing pattern, and no center city. 
This sprawl is laced with freeways, when 
every day hundreds of thousands of 
Americans speed along in isolated, alienÂ· 
ated, hypnotic, frenzied equality. Ronald 
Reagan has become the political expressi01 
of this way of life. 

The waking world has a way of intrudÂ· 
iog on dreams. Most of the population 
now lives north of the Newport Freeway, 
which bisects Orange County. They ocÂ· 
cupy homes built between 1950 and 196a 
which can be expected to deteriorate 
rapidly ten or fifteen years after constrlll" 
tion. Rather than pay the high cost d 
repair, residents are likely to travel south, 
where extensive residential development~ 
already under way. The dilapidated houses 
which they leave can probably be sold onl! 
to low income groups, groups to whom 
better housing is not available-to 
Negroes. Orange County, which voted 78 
percent against fair housing in 1964, ma! 
contain, within the next few years, another 
Watts. 

One day last summer, residents of 
Newport Beach, their eyes irritated to teaJI 
in a way they bad never expected, sensed 
that change was in the air; dirty, wispy 
brownish clouds, never before seen in the 
area, were floating in the sky, moving 
slowly down from the Los Angeles basin 
into Orange County. The sun was still 
warm, the blue waves rolled in as steadilY 
as ever, and the beaches were no less 
crowded. But for the first time, smog, 
resulting from the noxious gases released 
into the air by the cars and factories of 
modern society, had come to Orange 
County. 

It was only a few days later that thret 
well-scrubbed boys stood by Main Street 
in Disneyland watching a Chaplinesque 
"Disneyland Sanitation Department" 
worker shovel a yellowish-brown mound, 
a souvenir from a horse who had passed 
by earlier, into his cart. Two of the boys 
winced, grimaced, groaned, held their 
noses, and generally showed a militant 
disdain for the animal's excrement. The 
third, however, reacted differently. He VI' 
incredulous. He stared, and stared, and 
stared at the disappearing pile. In DisneYÂ· 
land? He just couldn't believe it.
