've seen me in there. I've seen you,
seen me.
PEDESTRIAN: What do you know? I'm late.
MR. AKIN: The sidewalk just went ...
down, and then it went ... up. Like a
certain stock I know.
PEDESTRIAN: You're sweating. It's cold
and you're sweating!
MR. AKIN: I sweat sort of easy like.
PEDESTRIAN: Why don't you get off the
8dewalk?
MR. AKIN: I can't.
PEDESTRIAN (Embarrassed): Oh,l'm sorry.
Are you ... Are you frozen or something?
MR. AKIN: Well ... I'm kind of frustrated.
Kind of hard to do anything on my own.
'He looks down)
PEDESTRIAN (Looking down at MR. AKIN'S
foot: a huge grin breaking): Oh, you've
made a monkey out of me! Gosh, I
think you were frozen. It didn't
sense.
; happily)
it! You're advertising, of course.
's it for?-some kind of footwear?
Yeah, there are the cameras.
(He points at the camera)
What station are you going to be on?
Something big, 1 bet, something like a
lllecial, huh? What station are you going
lobe on?
(Pause; Less happily)
1be camera guy's going to have to stop
llaning soon. I can't be in this.
(PGU.se)
9iby are you doing this? I mean, what's
tbebrand?
(Pause; growing frustration)
You know, not everyone tunes in on the
Ida. Okay, some are sort of funny. Is this
IDing to be funny? A sort of Rumple-
llilken thing?
IP....,e. Angry. He takes out a pen and pad)
Oby, who does your advef1ising?
at.Oding)
l11oft•t tell anyone.
.... e. A smiled whisper)
Oby.It's hush-hush. Look, I've got a
secret. I've got the crabs. What's your
secret?
(Afraid)
I haven't done anything to you! Why are
you bothering me? You've got me late to
work, you realize. Late!
(Pause)
You're going to come out of there and
molest me!!
I'm going to tell somebody. Okay? ...
You won't come out after me? ... Just
stay right there, huh?
(Backing away)
Stay! ... Stay!
In panic, the PEDESTRIAN searches out
another person. He stops a MAN and
points to MR. AKIN: the MAN stares and
laughs. Gradually, a CROWD gathers, is
told by whispers, gestures, jokes of MR.
AKIN'S predicament.
MR. AKIN looks at the CROWD. He is en-
circled. The CROWD is either embarrassed
to meet his gaze, or stares back coldly.
Some look sheepishly at the camera.
A bustling of the CROWD: an EXECUTIVE,
silver-haired and Important, a card-holder
of a high echelon, breaks through. For
MR. AKIN it is the coming of relief, of
safety, security, of help.
EXECUTJV£ (Approaching, sober and dis-
pleased): WeU?
MR. AKIN: I've never been so happy to see
anyone in my life!
EXECUTIVE: I can't claim to share your
embarrassing enthusiasm.
MR. AKIN: The sidewalk opened up. Just
like that!
(Surprised, he shakes his head)
It'll have to be repaired.
EXECUTIVE: And you're stuck, you're
saying!?
MR. AKIN: It's sort of like a flat tire.
EXECUTIVE: Has this ever happened
before?
MR. AKIN: I fell through the market once.
When I owned my own company.
EXECUTIVE: Just why do you suppose
this happens to you?
MR. AKIN: Well, things always happen to
me in three's.
Wait till next week. I'll reaHy go through
something!
I can't feel anything down there.
(He looks at his foot)
EXECUTIVE: And what am I supposed
to do?
MR. AKIN: I don't know.
EXECUTIVE: Well, I'm damn sure 1 don't!
MR. AKIN: Can we telephone somebody?
EXECUTIVE: Who, pray tell?
MR. AKIN: A lawyer, or something. I want
to get out!
EXECUTIVE: And what the hell do you
think I am? I'm a lawyer. I'm a law firm!
(He points out the skyscraper. But he is
now embarrassed: he has spoken loudly.
The CROWD stares at him)
I wish we could go somewhere and have
this out. But you have to do this in front
of everybody, just to embarrass me. Do
you think you're in a privileged position?
Hub? Is that it? ... Look what it does to
me:
(He includes the CROWD in a gesture)
I can't blow up since you have to pick on
a crowd like this.
You seem under the incredible impression
you can just do this and nothing will
happen. I can't have you in my employ-
ment any more. You're through working
forme!
Do you know what will come of this?
(He points to the camera)
He's going to develop this film-he's
going to print the film with your mug all
over it so everyone can have a good gas.
MR. AKIN: I'm aching!
EXECUTIVE: Will you lower your goddam
voice!
Now, quite calmly: you're through. You'll
have to find work elsewhere. I'll tell your
mother. I don't know what you're going to
do. I wouldn't want to be in your shoes.
My God, you've made a monkey out of
me!
(He looks at the CROWD: then hoarsely
to MR. AKIN)
Will you have the common decency to
smile while I leave?
(He departs through the CROWD)
MR. AKIN: But ... Daddy ... ?


MR. AKIN wearily lifts the newspaper. He
folds pages, coming to stop on the
"WANT ADS." Meanwhile, the CROWD:
CROWD: Daddy angry with you?
Why don't you do something?
You gonna just ... stick it out?
You know, we're going to be late for work.
So why doesn't he hurry up?
Maybe he'll scream. Or get bloody. Then
we can all go.
Why doesn't he jump?
(Chanting)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
SOUND: of drills humming in the distance.
MR. AKIN looks up. He strains his eyes.
A smile flickers. Construction workers are
drilling, a block and a half distant.
MR. AKIN looks at the CROWD, still chant-
ing. He reaches into his back pocket and
extracts a wallet. The CROWD quiets.
MR. AKIN withdraws a dollar bill.
MR. AKIN (Excited): Guess what? ... I
mean, I've just noticed a construction
group--you see? Over there? They've got
drills. Now I'll give a dollar to whoever
will run over and ask the guys if they
can't come get me out.
As MR. AKIN offers the dollar to several
faces, the CROWD looks away.
A YOUNG MAN steps forward, his hand on
the dollar bill.
YOUNG MAN: Here. I will.
MR. AKIN: Just ask them if they'll bring
their drills over. Will you?
MR. AKIN gives him the dollar. The YOUNG
MAN turns about and walks through the
CROWD in the direction of the workers.
The camera follows until he is half a block
away.
MR. AKIN: grim, anxious. Pause. His ex-
pression turns ironic.
The YOUNG MAN is running, turning down
a side street. He disappears.
MR. AKIN (Almost to himself): Stop, thief,
stop.
(He looks to the left. To the right. He
bends down and tears at his sock. It
comes off easily. He picks up his hat from
the sidewalk, brushes it. Pause. He extends
it, upside down)
Anyone want a look? Anyone want to look
at my foot? It costs one quarter.
No takers? For twenty-five cents a look ...
a look at a freak.
Nobody?
An old, bald man steps forward.
JEW: A nickel.
MR. AKIN: A quarter. Just a quarter to see
my foot.
MR. AKIN(Pause):Twentyceats. Two
dimes ... or whatever.
MR. AKIN: Fifteen cents.
JEW: A dime.
Pause. Then MR. AKIN extends his hat
further. The JEW approaches. He digs into
his pants pocket, removing a fistful of
change. He searches out a dime, devotes
it to the Cause. He stoops to his knees,
inches closer, and looks at the foot. Pause.
He turns back an awful face.
JEW: What a stink! I should oilly have
such aromas!
Mister, something's eating you!
(To the CROWD)
Three toes! Count 'em: three toes the guy's
got missing!
The CROWD starts talking, aroused. Peoplt
press in on MR. AKIN, jostle for position,
bend down to check it out. MR. AKIN takes
the dime from his hat, pockets it, stares
blankly out.
CROWD: Christ! You can see the toes dis-
appear right before your eyes.
What's doing it?
Can't tell. I don't see anything .. Does any-
body?
Not me.
How many toes does he have now?
About half of one.
But that's going quick.
Well, keep watching. Probably all of
him is going in a while.


It must be termites. Is it termites?
Here, Jet the others get a chance, huh?
Don't hog!
Better hurry!
Wt:ll, move!
That's it! He just got the bone. I don't
guess you can walk on something like that.
No, it ain't substantial.
I can't take the smell no more.
The CROWD draws back.
MR. AKIN looks off, through glass eyes,
darkly.
A FRUIT VENDOR is watching him,
casually leaning on his wares. He picks
up an apple, bounces it, and approaches
MR. AKIN, the CROWD letting him through.
PltUIT VENDOR: Did you have breakfast?
MR. AKIN (Dazed): Toast ... coffee ...
PltUITVENDOR: Would you like an apple?
MR. AKIN: An apple?
(He looks at it; his voice nearly breaks)
Yes.
PltUIT VENDOR (Merely palming the apple.
Pause. He points to MR. AKIN'S foot):
Someone else didn't have breakfast either.
(The CROWD titters)
You must taste very good.
(The CROWD laughs)
You look like you taste good.
lHis lips wet)
Do you taste good?
Gimme your dime!
You want my apple? Gimme your dime.
(MR. AKIN shakes, sweats. He takes the
dime from his pocket and hands it to th~
FRUIT VENDOR. Pause)
Open your mouth.
(Pause; hysterically)
OPEN YOUR MOUTH!
The FRUIT VENDOR places the apple in
MR. AKIN'S mouth, then walks away. The
CROWD is smiling. MR. AKIN is motionless.
Two MEN approach MR. AKIN. MAN #1 taps
him on the shoulder.
MAN #1: Your hands are free, you know.
MR. AKIN (Slowly, he brings his hand up
and removes the apple): Thank you.
Is ... Is my foot still there?
MAN lr2 (He bends down to look at the
foot. Then he looks up):There's still a
stump.
MR. AKIN: Well, that's something, isn't it!
Will you help me?
MAN #1: We have to go to work.
MR. AKIN: Oh, I can wait. I've waited.
Mterwork?
MAN #1: We have to go home.
MR. AKIN: Can anyone help me?
MAN # 1: How can anyone help you?
MR. AKIN: By going to the construction
gang.
MAN # 1: But they have to work.
MR. AKIN: Then, after work?
MAN # 1: They have to go home.
MAN #2: Besides, they're union men.
They're not allowed to branch out.
MR. AKIN: Couldn't a policeman be told?
MAN #1: What could a policeman do?
MR. AKIN: Get someone to dig me out,
men with drills.
MAN # 1: You tell a policeman and they
take down your name so they can call you
a lot of dirty things. And they take down
your address so they can sue you.
MAN #2: Besides, aren't they union men?
MR. AKIN: Well, what about firemen?
MAN# 1: Oh, come on! Firemen don't have
drills. They have hoses. And hoses don't
work in sidewalks. No, only the drillers
have drills.
MR. AKIN: And they're union men.
Then ... Oh, what chance have I?
FRUIT VENDOR (Leaning on his wares,
calling out): Hey! How can you guys stick
by him? Sweaty and smelly all over. I get
him from here. It's too much. You
shouldn't do nothing. Forget it.
MAN #1: Sorry.
MR. AKIN: That's alright. You can't help.
MAN ~1 (Turning to MAN #2): Come on.
MR. AKIN: Maybe next time, huh?
MAN ~tl: Yeah. Be seeing you.
The two MEN exit through the CROWD.
And the CROWD itself begins to disperse,
looking at timepieces. The FRUIT VENDOR
indolently pushes away his wagon. Pause.
MR. AKIN:
(Looking up)
Why? ... Why? ...
The camera looks up at the skyscraper.
Then down at MR. AKIN's foot. Pause.
MR. AKIN clenches his fists-though one
hand still grips the apple. He starts breath-
ing heavily. Pause. He bends his knees.
Gritting his teeth, he pushes up as violen.tly
as possible. Then a scream. Quick breath-
ing, finally slowing. A big weary sigh.
MR. AKIN: If only this were! Then I could
leave the picture.
(Pause. He again sets himself)
Take up thy foot and WALK!
On "'walk" he pushes up. Again and again
he tries. A final, sustained, quivering, ex-
travagant effort, ending in a cracked groan.
He falls, the apple drops ... one hears
clearly the sound of a bone breaking,
crunching. Long pause. MR. AKIN slowly
rights himself, sitting now. Pause. He picks
up the apple.
SOUND: of a subway train rumbling heavily
beneath the sidewalk.
The camera leaves MR. AKIN alone with his
apple. As it backs off, further and further,
MR. AKIN takes up his newspaper. Here-
moves the center section, tucks it into his
collar as a bib, polishes the apple on his
trousers . .. and only then beRins to eat.
Into a dissolve.
