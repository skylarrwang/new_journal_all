Harvard 
Cambridge--
Each September, just before classes begin 
at Harvard, the entering freshman class 
congregates in Sanders Theatre to be 
officially welcomed by President Nathan 
M. Pusey, and to hear Dean of Freshmen 
von Stade remark that the entire class will 
not be assembled again until its commence-
ment, four years away. He could ac-
curately add that President Pusey's 
welcome will probably be the last that 
the freshmen will hear or see of him 
during those four years. 

Dr. Pusey is not a charismatic man. 
He is not running for anything: his 
speeches are dry and businesslike, and 
seem to reflect his interpretation of his 
job, which is to keep the University grow-
ing, the money coming in, and the 
atmosphere quiet and untroubled. Under-
graduates think of him, when at all, as 
the grey embodiment of the business aspect 
of Harvard's operations, and a small 
group of students has until recently main-
tained that Dr. Pusey's invisibility was 
not apparent but real, that he was merely 
an abstract administrative contrivance. 

But on October 25th of this year, a 
group of Harvard and Radcliffe students 
and teachingÂ·fellows sat in front of a 
doorway in the Chemistry Department's 
Mallinckrodt Hall to protest the war in 
Vietnam, napalm, and what they said was 
Harvard's implicit support of both. The 
occasion of the demonstration was the 
arrival of a recruiter from the Dow 
Chemical Company, suppliers of napalm 
to the U.S. Department of Defense. The 
.demonstrators blocked the entrance to 
the room where the recruiter was attempt-
ing to hold interviews, prevented students 
from seeing him, and refused to allow 
him to leave for about seven hours. The 
administration was horrified, and six days 
later President Pusey emerged to articulate 
its position on the demonstration. 

Pusey's statement was read to the press 
at the end of a two-hour faculty meeting 
on October 31 which had approved the 
administration's recommendation to place 
seventy-four of the demonstrators on 
disciplinary probation. The statement was 
brief, serious, and firm. It emphasized 
that the disciplinary action just taken was 
entirely non-political, and based solely 
on the unacceptable tactics used by the 
de~onstrators. These tactics, Pusey as-
serted, were indecent and repugnant to a 
civilized society. Peaceful political expres-
sion was permitted and even encouraged 
at Harvard, but no obstructionist or 
violent demonstration would be tolerated 
in the future. 

That seemed for a moment to take care 
of the Dow incident. The punishment, 
although rather arbitrarily allocated 
among the three hundred demonstrators, 
was generally considered moderate, and 
was accepted without significant protest. 
Thus the unfinished business of Mallinc-
krodt was settled, and President Pusey's 
statement seemed to set clear and reason-
able guidelines for the handling of any 
future incidents. Franklin Ford, Dean of 
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, com-
pared the Dow denouement to the evacua-
tion of Dunkirk, and advised the Harvard 
community to feel relief rather than 
jubilation at the outcome. The Boston 
papers concluded a week of lurid coverage 
with the glum concession that "life is 
getting back to normal on the Harvard 
campus." 

In one sense, the Dow demonstration 
followed the pattern of last November's 
McNamara incident-a sudden, apparent-
ly spontaneous action by a comparatively 
small number of students, followed by 
weeks of discussion and analysis. But the 
uproar that followed the beseiging of 
Secretary McNamara's car was concerned 
with a question of manners. Everyone is 
sure that the Dow demonstration has 
raised more fundamental questions, al-
though there is some confusion on what 
those questions are. 

On the administration side, there is a. 
renewed fascination with civil liberties, 
now enlarged to include a "right of recruit 
ment" which must not in a free society be 
withheld for non-political groups such 
as Dow, the Armed Forces and the CIA. 
This argument of ~oral principle is collf 
plemented by a pragmatic one: if Harvard 
ceased to struggle for freedom of speech 
and movement, the forces of right-wing 
reaction would find it easier to curb the 
freedom of those to the left of the govem 
ment. To the repeated urgings of anti-wz 
activists that the University take a public 
stand against the war in Vietnam, the 
administration replies with. arguments 
about the educational necessity of neu-
trality in complex matters of public poliC)' 
The proper function of the university, 
according to this view, is to facilitate the 
free exchange of ideas, rather than to act 
as a political pressure group. 

The reaction of Harvard's radicals to 
these arguments is to assert that Harvard'! 
actual social function has very little to 
do with the free exchange of ideas, and 
a great deal to do with the government ani 
with the war. On the broadest level, the 
American university is seen as an essentia
