Exterior: street, day: 
The business district. A winter month. 
From the window of a skyscraper one 
watches the mechanical flow beneath. 
SOUND: of an approaching subway train, 
finished by a cruel breaking. 

A closer view details the intricate maneu-
verings of what had seemed an easy tide: 
the streaming from the underground into 
daylight, the jostling for position: a general 
moving, individually performed, played 
out against the sounds of a morning's rush 
hour. 

A study of legs as they attempt to avoid 
the trampling of a newspaper, folded to the 
listings of the American Stock Exchange. 

MR. AKIN makes his exit from the subway 
station, blinks at the sun, adjusts his flower, 
plots his course. Whereas others make the 
journey with a newspaper, MR. AKIN gazes 
unemotionally at the buildings: a sub-
limated aesthete. 

From another angle: detail of the studied 
avoidance of the stock quotations, this 
time of the Whol~Man, of the complete 
gesture. 

Slow motion. 

MR. AKIN approaches the folded news-
paper, his gaze still lifted. He looks down. 
He stops: a still of several seconds. Then 
he steps on . .. an exaggerated slow motion 
... steps purposively on the newspaper. 
His right leg drops outrageously, his face 
becomes a portrait of agony. 

A silent scream. 

The pavement block, as if on hinges, has 
dropped and closed up on his ankle. 

MR. AKIN regards his predicament. About 
to yell, he thinks better of it. Embarrassed, 
he decides on a light heart. 

Pause. He bends his other leg to effect a 
less lopsided look. A furtive glance reveals 
to his satisfaction that he has been un-
observed. To appear less conspicuous, he 
picks up the folded newspaper, pretending 
a study. 

Pause. He looks down: he grinds his teeth, 
his entrapped leg taut as fishing tackle, as 
he struggles to extricate himself. After an 
awful moment, his eyes roll, swim ... 

A spot appears on his sock, grows: blood. 

MR. AKIN pulls down his pants to cover 
his sock. 

Startled by his concentration, he looks 
about to check if he has been observed. 
He returns to himself, deliberating, 
preparing. Again he tries for freedom ... 
uselessly. Anger. Once again: an extra-
vagant effort, dying in a quiver, a stifled 
yelp. 

A PASSER-BY bumps into MR. AKIN. 
PASSER-BY (W a/king away, over his 
shoulder): Do you mind not taking up 
the whole sidewalk? 
MR. AKIN: Yes. 
PASSER-BY: There's a time and place for 
reading, you know. 
MR. AKIN: I'll be on my way. 

MR. AKIN pantomimes a brisk walk: arms 
swinging, weight shifting, eyes down. 
After a moment he looks up, relieved the 
PASSER-BY is no longer attending to him 
He looks behind, searching out another 
pedestrian. 

A PEDESTRIAN nears. MR. AKIN edges over, 
utters an abortive wave. 
MR. AKIN: I'm sorry. 
PEDESTRIAN (Continuing on, not looking): 
That's alright. 
MR. AKIN: Can you help ... ? 
PEDESTRIAN (Annoyed, eyes averted): 
No. Oh, no! I'm sorry. I've left my wallet 
... I don't know where ... 
MR. AKIN (Stopping him): It's not that 
kind of help. 
(The PEDESTRIAN turns to him, close, 
unaware) 
It's kind of embarrassing. Sort of. I ... 
Well, you see, I work in there, you know. 
(He points to a skyscraper) 
It's just ... Sir, it's just a question of 
getting there. 
(Pause)
