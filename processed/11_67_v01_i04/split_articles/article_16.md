**Yale: November 8th**
**Author: Jerry Bruck**
**Page number(s): 19-20**

On Wednesday, November 8, a great deal 
happened, or seemed to happen. First a 
nineteen year old from Coventry, Con-
necticut, who had enlisted in the U.S. 
Army and then decided that the Vietnam 
war, and killing in general, was wrong, 
showed up for orders at the Connecticut 
Induction Center on Chapel Street. He bad 
made his views known to local draft 
protestors, and twenty people with signs 
showed up to encourage him to refuse 
induction. At the end of the day here-
ceived a government escort from the 
Center to a bus bound for Fort Dix, New 
Jersey, after making a "V" sign to the 
shivering demonstrators. 


That same afternoon, thirty members of 
the Yale SDS picketed at 143 Elm Street. 
where Yale has its career advisory offices 
and where a CIA representative was pre-
paring to interview Yalemen seeking 
careers in the Agency. As applicants were 
hustled out a backdoor by the agent to a 
downtown office, the pickets were barred 
from the building on instructions from 
Assistant Dean of Yale College Donald 
Akenson. SDS cairman Karl Klare said 
that the hastily called demonstration was 
just the start of a challenge to University 
recruitment policy. Akenson defended 
the right of recruiters to recruit, but said 
that Yale had no formal policy in this 
regard and that the demonstration bad 
raised a point "that ought to be clarified, 
and which we intend to clarify." 


That night, Robert Welch debated 
Norman Thomas on whether or not we 
must negotiate withdrawal from Vietnam, 
under the auspices of the Yale Political 
Union. The debate had been billed by the 
P. U. as likely to be Thomas' last, and the 
Law School Auditorium was jammed with 
people come to watch. Thomas said that 
American involvement in Vietnam was 
helping Communism, that the war was 
everlastingly destructive of Vietnam, that 
it was unjustified by any of the canons of 
a just war, that it was dangerous and 
stupid. Welch said that we had to stay 
and win since we were there, though 
getting there was a mistake, part of a 
world-wide Russian-American Communist 
conspiracy that bad preplaoned what is 
happening now in Vietnam as far back as 
1952. He said we could win "overnight" 
if someone "took the wraps off our boys," 
let them go all-out. 
It was a silly sort of debate, cleverly 
staged for bored Yale folk, pre-ordained 
to demonstrate nothing. 


Meanwhile, Donovan was signing at 
Woolsey Hall, and over in SSS the Dump 
Johnson movement was trying to get 
underway. Allard K. Lowenstein, 1954L, 
who is vice-president of the ADA and 
chairman of the Conference of Concerned 
Democrats, which wants to dump LBJ, 
had come to town, and convinced anum-
ber of people that defeating Johnson in the 
primaries was possible, and ~e ~ 
productive step toward negouatmg the 
United States out of Vietnam. The meet-
ing heard Vincent Scully analyze the 
President, who was "dragging the United 
States with him into the very shades of 
hell." Ezra Stiles Master Richard Sewall 
said he had greeted news of the move-
ment's inception as "a burst of light on a 
dark landscape," and Lowenstein pre-
sented his arguments. 


The star speaker, former Connecticut 
Congressman Frank Kowalski, was saved 
for last, and spoke to a small and dwin-
dling audience in the auditorium. The 
former army colonel began eloquently, 
describing bow as the first military gov-
ernor of Hiroshima be had stood amongst 
the ruins of the city "and saw the charred 
hell ... and I made up my mind that I 
would fight for peace for the rest of my 
life." Then he rambled off into one thing 
after another, talking at time tragically, 
at others "of the silly hide-and-seek games 
in South Vietnam, where we are losing 
so many lives .... " 


Thought he thought that the war was 
wrong and that the U.S. ought to leave 
"as soon as possible," Kowalski didn't feel 
he could support defiance of the draft. 
After he had finished his speech and left 
the speaker's stand, he paused, walked to 
the side of the stage, and said in a shaken 
tone that be was leaving shortly for 
Washington, for his son was in the army 
and was on the point of leaving for Viet-
nam. The meeting was breaking up at that 
point, however, and hardly anyone heard 
him. 


The next day, a faculty petition was 
published in the Yale Daily News over 
more than 400 signatures. It was more 
strongly worded than the petition of last 
winter, which 462 faculty members had 
signed, but there was a certain absurdity 
in its call for President Johnson to "rise 
to his historical destiny," terminate the 
bombing of the North for good, and enter 
negotiations with the NLF towards "an 
honorable peace." 


A series of half-starts, confrontations 
with unclear outcomes, everything happen-
ing at once and an intellectual debate on 
the war that has remained roughly at the 
level of the first teach-ins while the war 
has grown by leaps and bounds. The 
malaise of a wide range of students op-
posed to our war in Vietnam has become 
increasingly pronounced, and since the 
range of tactics is so wide and the direct 
effects so unclear, they are starting with 
themselves, in the hope of building a 
movement, announcing either defiance-if-
necessary or total noncooperation and 
resistance now, to the draft. It seems to 
have been the Yale way to remain aloof 
from this sort of thing, but maybe it's 
changing now.
