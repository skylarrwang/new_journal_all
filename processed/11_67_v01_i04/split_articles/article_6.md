Oath


The Philosophy Department is currently refusing to accept National Defense Education Act Fellowships. Though the action was taken in the spring, it has thus far received no public notice.


The decision to reject funds under the NDEA, the largest government grant program to graduate students outside the sciences, is based on two requirements of the fellowship. First, an applicant must list all crimes for which he has been convicted or for which charges are pending. Secondly, he is liable for criminal prosecution if he is a member of an organization that has been ordered to register by the Subversive Activities Control Board.


The Philosophy Department made its decision after receiving a letter from the chairman of Cornell's philosophy department, Norman Malcolm, who urged all philosophy departments to refuse NDEA funds and to encourage other departments to follow. In a meeting last spring, the Yale department voted not to accept NDEA fellowships for this academic year.


The main objection within the department centered on the statement of crimes. Since an applicant could be denied an NDEA Fellowship for a crime with which he is merely charged, but not yet convicted, the department considered this a violation of individual liberties, and especially discriminatory against student activists and civil rights workers. "Almost anyone who does any civil rights work has some crime pending," said Robert Fogelin, associate professor of philosophy and one of the leaders of the anti-NDEA movement.


Neither could the faculty accept the criminal liability of an applicant who is a member of an organization officially considered subversive. The list presently contains relatively few organizations, but "Lord know what's going to crop up on that list," Fogelin argued. "The thing about lists is they tend to grow."


While nearly all members were opposed to the conditions of the NDEA Fellowships, debate within the philosophy department hinged on tactics. Fogelin argued fervently for formal rejection of the funds. "We should resist now while we still have a chance of controlling the steps," he said. "The whole drift seems to be in the direction of government support, and in ten years all our students may be on some kind of government grant. In ten years a university won't be able to resist."


Director of Graduate Studies Rulon Wells was one of the few who opposed the motion, and argued that it was "quixotic" simply to refuse NDEA Fellowships.


"I'm lukewarm about protest gestures for to my mind the aim is to get things done, not let people know how you think," said Wells. Rather than rocking the boat he favored working through the Yale administration, and Graduate School Dean John Perry Miller, who was working to change the NDEA laws through Washington lobbies.


Most of the faculty, however, agreed with Fogelin and voted not to accept NDEA Fellowships for this academic year. Though NDEA Fellowships are voluntary and a student can decline it and accept instead a Yale fellowship, the NDEA Fellowships are more generous. As stated in the department's explanation of decision, written by the Acting Chairman John E. Smith, "even if an individual student to whom such a fellowship is offered would be entirely on his own in accepting or in declining to accept the offered fellowship, the Department should not support a program which places any student in this position."


The NDEA Fellowship program at Yale, however, went virtually unaffected by the philosophy department's lone decision. Since the Yale Graduate School applies for NDEA funds as a whole and then allocates it among its departments, NDEA money originally intended for philosophy was given to another department, and funds from other areas were in turn channeled to philosophy.


For this reason, the philosophy department wants the question of Yale's participation in the NDEA program to be brought before the Graduate Faculty as a whole. The total number of NDEA Fellows at Yale has remained unchanged. There are still 220 graduate students receiving NDEA funds. In a letter to the Chairmen and Directors of Graduate Studies, the philosophy department said, "We realize that the amount of fellowship funds available for our department is dependent to an extent on the fact that some Departments accept NDEA Fellowships, and that we are thus ipso facto involved in the NDEA program." If any departments accept NDEA funds, all departments are involved.


If tradition is the guiding light of Yale's actions, then the university as a whole must confront this issue. For, when the NDEA was first passed by Congress in 1958, Yale, under the direction of A. Whitney Griswold, withdrew from the program because it contained a particularly distasteful loyalty oath. With Yale as one of the main lobbying forces, this loyalty oath, known as the "disclaimer affidavit", was repealed in 1962 and Yale chose to accept the other stipulations and re-entered the program.


Although the increasing tempo of war protest has made the problem ever more urgent, the rest of the Graduate School has reacted with glacial speed. Only six departments have even written replies to philosophy's request to bring the issue before the Graduate Faculty, and Dean Miller says, "There's been very little discussion."


Berger


In the admissions office propaganda film, To Be A Man, there's a quick transition from Robert Penn Warren, who has just asked, "What is beauty?", to a Yale student describing a luncheon with an unnamed professor.


"He was great," the student (more or less) says. "We talked about the coursework, but then we got around to me, to what I'd be doing next year, and he was really interested."


The unnamed professor is Harry Berger, who says of himself, "What I do is teach poems. It's recreative."


Berger, compact, energetic, moving quickly but not abruptly, came back to Yale last week for the first time in two years to deliver a Bergen Lecture on The Tempest. Berger first came to Yale in 1941 as a freshman, continued on into the Graduate School, and then taught English here until 1965 and a tenure crisis: there were five men and four positions, and Berger left for the new University of California campus at Santa Cruz.


Santa Cruz, midst the redwoods on Monterey Bay, represents California's attempt to humanize the multiversity. It's organized into a series of semi-autonomous colleges. Two have been built so far, each with about 600 students and 40 faculty fellows. The campus, programmed for intellectuality, has neither fraternities nor inter-collegiate athletics. Berger, a fellow of Cowell College, the first to be built, was also responsible from 1965 to 1967 for hiring English professors for the entire campus. "I hired three Yale Ph.D.'s," says Berger. "The Chancellor thought I was stacking the place. He was right."


Berger likes Santa Cruz, "The kids are very bright," he says. "The ones with the right motivations applied in the first place. But it's so different from Yale, which is a glamorous, alien environment you have to cope with. At Yale the students are more efficient, like captains of industry. In California, everything is so homogeneous, and the kids are a little more innocent. They're eager to learn, but sometimes they come to Santa Cruz expecting a dreamboat of an education. They don't know how hard you have to work to get anything out of anything."


The core courses are taught within each of the colleges. Berger started a core course in literature (as opposed to English), the theory for which he had worked out in his head at Yale. It's based upon the notion of "Speaker/thing Said": it operates on a continuum, with first-person lyric poetry (suitable to Empsonian-style New Criticism) at one end, and straight narrative at the other end. The course is organized around the question: "What is it to say?"


Berger is avoiding, however, generic approaches, which he considers useful only for historical criticism, to determine what a writer thought he was doing.


"Genres are critically unuseful," he says. "Northrop Frye keeps making the same mistakes with archetypes. He looks at all works from a middle distance and can't see the differences in each work. He also assumes a common acceptance of the reading of works, which isn't true."


Berger believes the college system at Santa Cruz promotes more of a sense of a community of scholars than it does at Yale. "An anthropologist and a marine biologist and I talk about what we're doing and we find we have a fund of common ideas hanging there. We all use them. But, of course, Freudian notions are used one way in literature and another way in anthropology."


In some ways, Berger has also discovered that he's a conservative. "Some
