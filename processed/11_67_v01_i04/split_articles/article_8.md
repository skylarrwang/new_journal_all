"C'mon Joe," they would say 
to him. "A few of the jokes, 
maybe yes, but not the whole 
book. You don't have that 
kind of tragic sense." 
By Susan Braudy 
"I believe that Joseph Heller is one of the 
most extraordinary talents now among us."

"/like a lecture that mentions Catch-22 ." 
-Yale Freshman, 1967 
"I had lunch today with Joseph Heller. 
You know what he talked about during 
lunch. Lunch. He talked about lunch," 
said a graduate student. "Orange drink at 
Yale. Either that guy is wearing a mask or 
else he didn't write that book." 
"Joseph Heller, an easy-laughing man," 
was the way Vogue magazine saw Heller 
a year after Catch-22 was published. 
Vogue held a manicured finger to the 
fashion winds and called Heller a new 
trend in fashion, along with the high-
waisted dress and the overblouse. 


But Heller doesn't laugh easily and he 
did write Catch-2 2. When Heller, the 
master of tragi-comic farce, laughs, he 
sounds only obliging. It's as though be 
were reading, hahahaha, from a script of 
the conversation. 


When he writes, Heller uses humor to 
lure his audience into unexpected con-
frontations with a tragic truth. Suddenly 
the immediacy of your laughter brings 
you face to face with man's vulnerability. 
But in real life Heller uses his humor to 
keep people from looking too closely at 
him and, more important, to defend him-
self from the truths he too easily sees. 


"Of course he's masked," says a close 
friend of Heller's. "He'd be an open wound 
otherwise. There's nothing arty about 
Joe's mask, either. He's often mysterious 
because be's so plain." 


"Today's Rosh Hashanah, a religious 
holiday, right? No classes on Rosh 
Hashanah. So what're you doing here?" 
Heller greets the playwriting students 
waiting for him in the gloomy hall of the 
Drama School annex. He sees he is the 
only one enjoying his joke. He laughs 
loudly and shifts his gum massage stick 
from the side to the front of his mouth. 
"All right, you convinced me. We'll have 
our class." 


This semester Heller is teaching a grad-
uate playwriting seminar and an under-
graduate creative writing class at Yale, 
while the Drama School is producing his 
new play, We Bombed in New Haven, 
which opens December 4. 


Heller is a thick and handsome 44. He 
looks like he might have made a lot of 
money publishing popular art books in 
New York. His face is large and fleshed 
out, but not fat. His large brown eyes seem 
to stare directly inward as well as outward. 
He looks prosperous. 


Despite the expensive navy or green 
blazer, the striped shirt and tie, Heller 
looks tough. Maybe it's the Stim-u-dent 
toothpick that hangs out of the side of ?is 
mouth. Maybe it's his graying curly barr 
long in the back and in the sideburns, but 
slicked back from a widow's peak. It could 
be his broad shoulders or the slight swag-
ger in his walk. The effect is exotic for 
Yale, but not for the Drama School. 


Twenty years ago Esquire printed a 
Heller short story along with a picture of 
Heller, 24 years old, a junior Phi Beta 
Kappa at Nytj, married, and the owner of 
a good conduct medal from the war. 


In Esquire's picture, his large nose and 
SUSAN BRAUDY, the wife of Leo 
Braudy, a member of the English Dept., 
does free-lance writing. 
eyes sit uneasily on a dark, skinny face. He 
looks scared and underfed. Like most pic-
tures, if you stare at it long enough, the 
eyes seem to stare directly outward and 
directly inward at the same time. 


"Listen, you're crazy," a tired Heller 
rubs the back of his neck in the New 
Haven railroad station. "You've over-
researched this article. What do you want 
to work so hard for? Next time you write 
an article, take my advice, hand the guy 
20 questions and a tape recorder, and 
that'll be your article." 


Heller had agreed to let me interview 
him on the train back to New York after 
his Thursday classes. I started to leave him 
to buy my ticket. "Better take your notes 
with you," he said, "or I may burn them. 
Who would be interested in all that junk 
about me anyway?" 


Heller has a thing about money. He 
enjoys talking about it. A few years ago 
Heller and Edward Albee were both guests 
at a small dinner party. Albee wanted to 
talk Art. But he never got the chance. 
Heller spent all evening talking about 
taxes. 


"My generation was oriented to the 
Depression," Heller once said. "When I 
was in school, we all wanted to get out and 
make a good living. Today most students 
do not know what they want to do. They 
only know what they don't want to do--
go to war." 


In the dining car of the train, Heller 
begins, "I'm probably going to fall asleep 
before I can answer any of your questions. 
Tell me again why you're writing this 
article. Somebody must be paying you a 
lot of money to ride into New York with 
me. You're probably crazy." 


He leans across the table and whispers, 
"If you sit here in the dining car, some-
times you can get a free ride." 


Interviewer: "What did you hope to ac-
complish by writing We Bombed in New 
Haven, Mr. Heller?" 


H el/er (rolls his handsome head and 
sighs to the ceiling before he puts a fresh 
Stim-u-dent in his mouth. He talks like 
the guy eating at the delicatessen after 
Saturday morning golf.): "What else, 
I wanted to make a million dollars." 


Interviewer: "No, really." 


Heller: "All right. Right now I want to 
make every woman cry and every man 
feel guilty when he has to go home and 
face his sons. What can fathers do 
about VietNam? 
(Heller pauses and says with emphasis) 
"You ask what did I mean to accom-
plish. I meant to write a very good play." 


The Resistance has bought tickets for 
the play to aid the movement against the 
war. Heller predicts that, if things continue 
as they are now, in six or eight months 
I 00.000 Americans will be under indict-
ment for breaking laws in draft protests. 
"This could end the war. They can't put 
everybody in jail." 


Heller believes this war is different from 
World War II. World War II, be believes, 
had to be fought. 


A little over a year ago, H o/iday sent 
Heller (and his wife and two children) 
back to the air base in Corsica where most 
of his war, World War II, took place. From 
there, Heller had flown missions as a wing 
bombadier. 


But Corsica was no longer the place his 
war had been. His war was over and gone, 
and he saw that even his travel-weary, 
ten-year-old son realized it. 


"What the grouchy kid didn't realize 
though was that his own military service 
was still ahead; and I could have clasped 
him in my arms to protect him as he stood 
there, half hanging out of the car with his 
sour look of irritation." 


In We Bombed In New Haven, Captain 
Starkey must personally induct his son 
into the army. Starkey always does what 
he is told. He fits into the system, and the 
system destroys him. 


Heller never read Pirandello, but Piran-
dello's spirit is in the play. The characters 
are both actors and soldiers at the same 
time. Their parts and their lives as soldiers 
are controlled by an existing script that 
they have read and by a metaphysical 
script to which only the Major has access. 
When another character refuses to die, 
as the script dictates, the Major is not sur-
prised. Because he has the ultimate script, 
the Major knows how this man must 
ultimately die. 


One of Heller's playwriting students re-
marked on the relevance of the play 
metaphor. "Most guys think they'll go in, 
play the role of the soldier for two years, 
and then come back and pick up where 
they left off. They don't think: go in, play 
soldier, and be killed. If they knew what 
Heller's characters know about their own 
deaths, they wouldn't take it so lightly." 


The Drama School publicity people 
asked Heller if they could advertise the 
play as a comedy. Heller said no. Even 
though, he says, if you call it a comedy, 
more people will probably buy tickets to 
see it. But Heller uses comedy and satire 
for other ends. There are many jokes in the 
first act of the play. But early in the 
second act, a soldier says, "There'll be no 
more laughing tonight", and the play 
moves swiftly to its tragic conclusion. 


H el/er (showing no signs of falling 
asleep as he eats his chicken dinner in 
the dining coach of the New York train): 
"I know what you can write about. I'll 
give you the anecdote about how I hap-
pened to write the play." 


Heller was born in Coney Island in 
1923. In Show magazine, he wrote: 
"Coney Island is beautiful to children and 
ugly to adults, and, in this respect, it is 
often typical of life itself." 


After graduating from Abraham Lin-
coln High School in 1941, HeUer went to 
work as a blacksmith's helper in the Nor-
walk Navy Yard, though at the time be 
was too skinny to lift a sledge hammer. 


He enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 
1942, a few months before be would have 
been drafted. Like Yossarian, Heller 
figured that the war would be over before 
he got into it. 


"What incredible optimism we had in 
those days. We believed that any country 
that tried to take on the US would be 
knocked off in a week." 


First Heller went to armorers' school. 
Then he transferred to cadet school when 
rumors began to circulate that armorers 
became gunners. Gunners didn't last long 
in combat. 


Heller went into combat as a wing 
bombadier in 1944, two years after be 
enlisted. He remembers that at first be was 
disappointed because his missions were 
milk runs, that is, nobody shot back at his 
plane. 


"I was a jackass. I thought war would 
be a lot of fun, but I wasn't the only one 
who was naÂ·ive." 


Heller listened quietly as a playwriting 
student told him about Jack Valenti's 
recent talk in the Law School. Valenti,
