**Page number(s): 3-4**

MICHAEL MANDELBAUM, a senior in Yale College, from Berkeley, Calif., is writing his senior essay in political science on Orange County. He spent the summer there doing research. STEVEN WEISMAN, a Yale senior from Beverly Hills, Calif., has lived in Orange County and worked there one summer as a newspaper reporter. He has also written for The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. This is his second appearance in The New Journal.


Ronald Reagan is governor of California, an undeclared Presidential candidate, and soon to be a Chubb Fellow at Yale. How is all this possible? A significant part of the answer resides in Orange County, which lies in the sun just south of Los Angeles.


Independence Day came early this year to Orange County. Since the California Angels were playing on the night of Tuesday, July 4th in Anaheim Stadium, the traditional (i. e. second annual) "Glorious Old-Fashioned Independence Day Fireworks Spectacular and Pageant" was moved back to Sunday night, July 2nd. Fortunately, the mayor of Anaheim had discovered that the Declaration of Independence was actually adopted by the Continental Congress on July 2, 1776, although not signed until two days later. Thus, their sense of history heightened, ten thousand patriotic families climbed into their cars in nearby Tustin, Garden Grove and Costa Mesa and drove up the SantAna Freeway to celebrate "Declaration of Independence Adoption Day."


It was a curious show. Produced by Tommy Walker, former entertainment impressario at Disneyland (where he created "Fantasy on Parade" and "Fantasy in the Sky"), its first part owed more to Ted Mack and His Amateur Hour than to Thomas Jefferson. Fire house bands blared, performing dogs cavorted around the pitcher's mound, and a French dare-devil careened high over the stands on a wire suspended sixty feet above the infield. A precision drill team clicked and stomped on to the field. They were followed by the Orange County Liberty Chorus and several military color guards, representing each branch of the armed forces. A red convertible carried Miss Liberty Belle, a blond would-be actress, and the Grand Marshal, a marine just off the plane from Saigon.


The marine was greeted on the speaker's platform at the first base line by the evening's host, Marvin Miller, a television performer ("The Millionaire") and movie actor with considerable experience in the Orient himself ("The Shanghai Story" and "Peking Express").


After a few words from the marine ("Ah shore wish all the boys over in Vet Nahm could be here") the audience rose and sang the "Star Spangled Banner" with great vigor.


The parade drained away into the dugouts and then the main attraction: a series of special fireworks displays, a "Super Pyrotechnic Spectacle Sublime" with the theme "In Pursuit of Freedom." The son et lumiere traced the thread of American history, beginning with the Mayflower and the determined, persevering words of the Pilgrims. The scene shifted to Independence Hall, to the high seas, where John Paul Jones won big, then to Abraham Lincoln in his hour of trial. The Lusitania sank in a shower of sparks, and World Wars I and II were fought in five colors. Franklin D. Roosevelt said that the freedom won in these battles must be preserved and protected with vigilance. Finally, the Statue of Liberty, symbol of the pursuit of freedom, appeared and illuminated the scoreboard with a harsh glow. "We are proud," boomed Marvin Miller, "that we are a free people, and that we are Americans."


The program, however, was not over. The final moment belonged to an individual, a deceased "Great American" to whom Dwight D. Eisenhower had recorded a message of tribute. As the former president's voice echoed through the stadium, huge sparks flew out of the right field bullpen and up into the summer sky, outlining the face of Orange County's addition to the patriotic legacy descending from the Pilgrims-Walt Disney.


In early Fall of 1966, the voters of Orange County (the home of most of the people who filled Anaheim Stadium on July 2, 1967) received in the mail a speech recorded on a small vinyl plastic disc. The voice in the recording was flat in tone, but clear, forthright and resolute. It was without ambiguity, like a problem in simple addition.


"My fellow Californians," it began, "this is Ronald Reagan. 1966 is the year of decision for all of us. It's the year when we must decide if our state will go on to greatness in our progressive tradition, or whether it will level to continued mediocrity and the tired, outworn policies of a machine-run by hacks, cronies, incompetents and buyers and sellers of favors. This is the year when Californians of both parties must decide whether they are willing to settle for big brother government, big brother in Sacramento, where the governor has no confidence in the people, and big brother in Washington, where the administration has no confidence in the governor.


Our country is made up of ordinary citizens, and I have a deep and abiding belief that our Founding Fathers made it to be run by ordinary citizens .... The men and women of California are capable of self-government .... A new governor would insist on the right of the community to pass laws enabling them to deal with their particular problems. He'd take action to halt the rising crime rate and the rising cost of welfare.


Vote for me if you believe in yourself; if you believe in your right to determine your own destiny, make your own decisions, and plan your own life."


Over seven out of ten of the residents of Orange County believed in themselves strongly enough to vote for Ronald Reagan. Like a medieval monarch, Reagan is both symbol and defender of the faith of the county; that faith is conservatism, rooted in suddenly and independently acquired prosperity, and the beliefs about America and the world to which that prosperity gives rise. The overwhelming
