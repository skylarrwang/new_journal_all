How My Draft Board 
X' 
Dodged the Subject When 
I Brought Up the Draft 
By Richard Harison 

When I left my home in Westport, 
Connecticut last summer and set out for 
California, I hardly expected to return 
as a non-cooperator with the Selective 
Service System and a full-time organizer 
for the Resistance. I came back in October, 
after turning in my draft card, because it 
seemed to me that I had a responsibility 
to explain my actions to each member of 
my draft board, to try to make them con-
front the issues individually, just as I had. 

It was with a vague uneasiness that I 
plodded along the rain-soaked streets of 
Bridgeport, hunting out the residences of 
the nameless, generally faceless men who 
decide whether a young man such as 
myself spends his time in San Francisco 
or Viet-Nam. 

I kept asking myself whether anything 
I could say would make these men appre-
ciate my position, let alone get them to 
thinking that what they were doing might 
not be in anybody's best interests. 

I remembered when I had gone before 
them as a group. U they acted individually 
in the same manner as they did together, 
I thought, peering at a house number, then 
this was all a waste of time. My only com-
fort was denying them the privilege of 
smugly passing me off as a draft-dodger, 
Communist, traitor, or any of the other 
epithets that they were likely to use. 

Impossible as it might seem, I still hoped 
they would understand. 

With that hope, I ran the bell of Number 
Two, a portly, seemingly pleasant man in 
his early fifties. (I used this numerical 
designation not only because it is the 
preference of the board members that 
nobody know who they are, but also be-
cause of the remarks of one of the board 
clerks who referred to the chairman as 
"Number One, the BIG man.") 

I explained that I had returned my draft 
cards on October 16th and had flown back 
from the coast to talk about it. He laughed 
and placed his arm on my shoulder. 
"Why you didn't have to come all the 
way back here for that," he said, "You 
could have just written the Board. They 
would have sent you another one." 

I tried to explain, but he seemed deter-
mined to believe that I wanted a favor 
from him. 
"You can be sure that the Board will 
decide your case fairly and in your best 
interests. We certainly don't want to send 
anybody who has a good reason for not 
going." 

"I realize that," I replied, "but as things 
stand, the board is not who's going to 
decide .... " He glanced at his watch. 
"I'm sorry," he said, "but you'll have to 
excuse me right now. I have a Church 
meeting to attend." He straightened his 
tie. "I'm a Deacon, you know." 

I thanked him for his time and left, 
puzzled mainly about his lack of curiosity. 

At Number Three's house I received a 
more expected reaction. It was hard even 
getting him to the door. He seemed quite 
absorbed with the show he was watching 
on his color TV set. 

When he finally did answer, I delivered 
my prepared sentence of introduction. His 
initial remark was that I should present 
myself at the next Board meeting, and 
they would decide fairly what was to be 
done. 

RICHARD HA.RISON, who groduaud 
from Yale in 1966, has studied at the 
Institute for the Study of Non-Violence in 
Carmel, Calif., and is now an organizer 
for the Resistance in San Francisco. 

"But I have turned in my draft card," 
I said. 
"Well you better get another one." 

I was once again stumbling for the right 
words when he continued. 
"I don't see why you've come to me 
about it. I can't do anything for you. 
You'll have to see the Board." 

"But I am no longer going to deal with 
the board," I replied, "I'm only here 
to .... " 
"Wait. Wait just a minute now," be 
said, finally grasping the situation. "Just 
who puts these ideas in you kids heads 
anyhow? Who does it? Your professors or 
what?" 

"Not just them," I answered. "Lots of 
people. Professors, friends, ministers, 
people I respect, books, the New Testa .... " 
"You went to school then, did you?" 

"Yes," I replied, "I graduated from 
Yale in 1966." 
"And what church do you go to?" 

"Mostly Episcopal; I also attend Quaker 
meeting." He shook his head. 
"All that fine upbringing, and you still 
don't believe in war. Well I want you to 
know one thing. I didn't like it in '42 when 
I went to war. I was 38 years old then. 
Had a nice job and a good home. But I 
went when my country called." 

"You enlisted?" I asked. 
"Well, no, I was drafted. But it's all the 
same. I went. But you listen to my advice. 
Go down to the Board and ask them to 
set up a hearing for you. We'll decide your 
case fairly." 

I thanked him for his time and turned 
towards the door. 
"You're lucky I didn't know what this 
was all about, or I wouldn't have let you 
in in the first place." He firmly closed the 
door. 

Number Four seemed more interested 
and more curious. He was very courteous 
and very prompt to open the door. Un-
fortunately, most of our hour-long con-
versation was spent while he rambled on 
about his boyhood days, but occasionally 
he would dwell on specific points. 

"What's the matter with young kids in 
this country today? America has been 
good to them. They have a good educa-
tion, most of them, come from nice homes. 
Why shouldn't they fight for their country? 
My grandfather, my father, and I all 
went. My son just got out. Four year hitch 
in the Navy. Besides we got to stop these 
Communistics. You don't want to fight 
them over here do you?" 

"1 don't want to have to fight them any-
where," I answered. "I think man can 
find alternatives to war." 
"Try and tell them that." 

"Even if that were true," I said, "does 
that make it right to violate the United 
Nations Charter or the 1954 Geneva 
Agreements? Is America to be proud that 
she condemns criminality and violence 
and yet practices both of them?" 

"Well, if you're talking about Viet-
Nam," he said, "I agree with you. I'm as 
opposed to this war as you are. It was a 
mistake to get involved, and it is a mistake 
to keep fighting there." 

Then how, I asked, could he keep send-
ing more and more men over there? How 
could be serve on a draft board whose 
function is to replace the men who have 
already died with more and more? Number 
Four straightened up in his chair and 
folded his hands. 

"That's what the government wants me 
to do, and they've been good to me. I got 
a nice house, a car, a good job. I raised 
kids here. Besides, nobody can stop this 
war. The Vice-President says it doesn't 
matter how they vote in San Francisco, 
'cause he's not going to pay any attention 
to them." 

"But if I were opposed to the war," 
I replied, "I certainly wouldn't work for 
Dow Chemical or Colt." 

"Oh, but that's different," he replied. 
"People are always going to hunt." 

"Not with M 16s and napalm," I said. 
"And don't you ever look forward to a 
world where man can live without war?" 

"Sure I do. That's why we got to fight. 
To stop people from wanting to conquer 
people." 

I glanced at my watch and rose to leave, 
thanking him for listening to me. I had 
reached the door when he said "You'll see. 
There's nothing you kids can do to stop 
this war, so you might as well shape up 
and go. You'll only be ruining your life 
if you don't go. And who knows? You 
might just get a desk job or something." 

I got back inside the car and looked at 
my list. The last man on it was Number 
One. I remember him well from the time 
I had gone before the board. How could 
I forget his neat little syllogism about 
pacifists: 

I. Pacifists don't like war. 
2. Nobody in the army likes war; 
therefore: The army is a group of 
pacifists. 
3. People in the army are serving; 
therefore: All pacifists should serve. 

When I got to his apartment, I rang 
the bell, and I heard someone on the inside 
approach the door. But instead of open-
ing it, he seemed to wait behind it. Finally 
he rustled a few locks and the door 
opened about four inches before the brace 
of chains snapped taut. I explained who 
I was and why I was there. 

"Please leave. There's nothing I can do 
for you." 

"If you're busy right now, I could come 
back some other time, either here or at 
your office." I watched his eyes scrutiniz-
ing me inch by inch while his hand gripped 
the doorknob. 

"No, please leave me alone," he said, 
shutting the door. 

As 1 approached the doorman, I couldn't 
help but remarking, "Mister F. is a very 
frightened man, isn't he?" 
"Yes," the doorman solemnly replied, 
"he is."
