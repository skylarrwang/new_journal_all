EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
diverse community. Officers certainly 
have the law at their disposal. The law 
often proves effective, especially when 
brought co bear on drug dealers, wife 
barterers, and others whose daily rou-
tines involve.systematic dehumaniza-
tion and death-peddling. The law has 
less power to stop crimes that actually 
disturb the community the most. 

Police worry about violent crimes like 
murder; but it's the petty crimes like 
vandalism that make people worry 
that their neighborhoods are out of 
control. Those small acts of defiance 
undermine the order of neighbor-
hoods-they send the message to the 
community that citizens who play by 
the rules are saps. 

Accordingly, police need more 
sophisticated tools to muster the com-
munity's support. Without the mobi-
lization of New Haven's neighbor-
hoods, those venues for self- and com-
munity-expression, the police depart-
ment has little chance of inspiring self-
reliance. 

Community policing is no more 
than quality police work that takes 
advantage of the city's essence, its 
minute sources of identity. I'm lucky 
to be here. Whatever problems we 
have within the agency, the funda-
mental source of our legitimacy-
the neighborhoo d-is stro ng in 
New H aven, and we'll make it 
stronger.
