"Our faculty tends to probe, test, and 
wrestle with the prevailing liberal agen-
da," he said. 


Shuck deplores the reluctance of 
conservative students to air their 
views publicly. "If students feel 
stifled it's because they don't exercise 
their independent judgment. They are 
unwilling to court disapproval from 
their peers, which is pathetic," said 
Shuck. "Many conservatives don't 
want to stand up and oppose the liber-
al agenda, which I don't respect." 

According to Cranston, some con-
servative students duck controversy in 
law school in order to avoid the label of 
troublemaker. He believes that today's 
conservatives can damage their chances 
for future success by causing controver-
sy. Such students join the Federalist 
Society because it offers a niche in 
which they can state right-wing views 
without provoking negative reaction. 
"In the more liberal atmosphere ofYale 
Law School, you could generate con-
troversy by espousing a view that out-
side of here might be accepted," said 
Cranston. "You still need an untar-
nished reputation to get ahead in the 
job market." However, he admits that 
conservative students are safe given the 
country's political atmosphere. "With 
the current Republican administation, 
conservative students no longer fear 
that their views alone will inhibit their 
life after Yale," he said. 

Shuck and Wycoff doubt that stu-
dents would have a difficult time find-
ing jobs due to the political controver-
sy their conservative views provoke. 
"The idea that holding conservative 
views in any way threatens a student's 
career is preposterous," said Shuck.

Most Yale law students go on to jobs 
in large law firms, clerkships, or 
academia. According to Wycoff, even 
students who enroll with the goal of 
working in public interest law often 
end up gainfully employed in private 
firms. "I find it odd that conservatives 
feel that their views would hurt them 
in corporate America," he said. 

Federalist Society members admit 
that when they pursue clerkships with 
prestigious state or district judges, 
conservative views and Federalist 
Society membership open doors. Eric 
Nelson provides a case in point. His 
affiliation with the Society helped gain 
him a clerkship with Clarence 
Thomas, then a judge on the Federal 
Court of Appeals. "The Federalist 
Society led to an interview for the 
clerkship that I might not otherwise 
have gotten," said Nelson. 

Although the Yale Federalists took 
no official position on the Thomas 
hearings, most law school students 
who vocally supported the judge were 
Federalist Society members. The 
Society plans to create its own alumni 
award and make Thomas the first 
recipient. "We felt Thomas was an 
esteemed alum who had been over-
looked and shafted by the alumni asso-
ciation for being conservative," said 
co-president Koenig. 

As the Federalist Society grows 
older and more well known, its power 
in the world beyond Yale will continue 
to grow, especially if the Republicans 
maintain their hold on national gov-
ernment. "I think that conservative 
judges are on the lookout for 
Federalist Society members from hot-
shot law schools because they want to 
have an ideological fellow feeling with 
their clerks. It's quite a formidable net-
work now that alums are Federal 
judges," said Nelson. "The Society can 
definitely have a beneficial effect on 
your future."
