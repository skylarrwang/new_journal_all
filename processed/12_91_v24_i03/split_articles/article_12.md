unmarked room where they now 
reside. Without classroom exposure co 
the more graphic side of medicine, 
many students never overcome their 
initial repulsion to malformed speci~ 
mens. "The.studenrs can't deal with 
reality," Dr. Crelin said. "These speci~ 
mens are not really shocking once you 
understand them." 

The actual practice of medicine 
often drives home to recent graduates 
the relevance of the collection. 
Medical residents visit it more fre~ 
quently than the students themselves. 
"When students become doctors, they 
see that a patient is not a cell organelle, 
but a real functioning anatomical 
specimen that you can see with the 
naked eye," Dr. Crelin said. He only 
wishes that medical education led 
them to that realization earlier.

**From Serbia to Silliman**
**Author: Solange Betchler**

The Serbo~Croacian wac, which began 
when Croatia declared itself indepen~ 
dent from Yugosla~ia on June 25, 
1991, has resulted in the destruction 
of cities and the deaths of thousands 
of Yugoslavs. Many young men such 
as Zoran Kozic (SM '95) have fled 
from a war they do not want to fight. 
Kozic left his country this summer, 
after an old friend and hockey team~ 
mace died fighting for the Serbian 
army. Displaced Yugoslavs like Kozic 
now flood Europe as they travel 
around with tourist passes. "Vienna is 
full of Yugoslavs," Kozic said. "I saw 
old friends as I walked down the 
street." 

Kozic left Yugoslavia not only 
because of the war, but also because he 
could no longer tolerate what he 
describes as the tyrannical repression 
of Eastern European communism. 
Kozic denounced "communist propa-
ganda" when he was in high school, 
and spoke out against the government 
after his experiences traveling in the 
West 
with 
his 
hockey team. 
"Communism is supposed to mean 
equality, but Tiro lived like a king and 
people are supposed to be happy on 
$200 a month," he said. "People in 
Romania and Bulgaria are in total iso~ 
lation. They are poor and uneducated 
and they don't know what is going on 
in the rest of the world." 

Even as a child, Kozic dreamed of 
studying in the U. S. "I didn't want to 
go back to Yugoslavia-! wanted to 
study in the United States," he said. 
"All of my friends study in universi~ 
ties, but they know that if they don't 
leave the country they will never find 
a job." After graduating from high 
school, he joined a junior hockey 
league in Canada, where he was 
named Rookie of the Year. In Canada, 
Kozic believes, hockey scouts from 
American universities sported him. 
Kozic spent the months between 
June and his arrival at Yale evading 
the Serbian police. Men between rhe 
ages of 18 and 55, he says, avoid 
spending the night at home or have 
their family members tell the police 
they are not there. Sometimes police 
have women call "to trick us into 
answering the phone," said Kozic. For 
days at a rime he lay low with friends 
and relatives in Austria, Hungary, 
Germany, and Montenegro. 
On July 31, Yale admissions did 
what the Serbian police could not. 
They tracked down 
Kozic 
in 
Montenegro, where they notified him 
of his admission to Yale. His accep~ 
tance letter helped him obtain an 
American visa, more valuable than 
gold in Yugoslavia. "There are lines 
around the embassy in Belgrade 
where they wait two days just to 
apply for a visa," Kozic said. Only 
people with family in the United 
States or students accepted into 
American universities can obtain 
visas. Fortunately the American 
ambassador in Serbia graduated from 
Yale, and Kozic quickly procured his 
VISa. 
Kozic left war~torn Yugoslavia 
without regrets. Yet his dual nation-
ality adds the problem of national 
loyalty to the trauma of the war. The 
son of a Croatian mother and a 
Serbian father, Kozic once resided in 
Zagreb, C roatia but spent most of his 
youth in Belgrade, Serbia. "I have 
friends and family in both states who 
always want me to side with them," 
Kozic said. "I have no national l oyal~ 
cy, but I think every state should be 
independent."
