Two weeks ago, thousands of students 
streamed under the massive Walter Camp 
memorial colonnade into the Yale Bowl to 
witness the I 08th annual Yale-Harvard 
football game. Over a century ago, when 
Camp (Yale College 1880) first came to 
Yale, football was a much more brutal 
game without padding or penalties. 

During his undergraduate days and later as 
Yale's director of athletics, Camp essencially 
transformed football into the game as we 
know it today. 

Camp's innovations in the rules of 
football began in his days as an undergrad-
uate at Yale and continued throughout his 
life. Captain of the Blue (as Yale was 
known then) for three seasons, he intro-
duced the scrimmage. The scrimmage 
added an element of strategy to football 
that sec the game apart from British rugby. 
His other contributions include the use of 
the quarterback, the rules of possession, 
and the gridiron. In 1889, he sdeaed the 
first All-American football team. By the 
end of his life, his name had become 
nationally synonymous with football and 
athleticism. 

Camp's ideals for athletics extended 
well beyond the glories of victory. He 
believed football could aid personal devd-
opmenr and build team spirit. "Camp fos--
tered the idea that play should be a test of 
character," said Jean-Christophe Agnew, an 
American Studies professor who specializes 
in Camp's era. "It should have the srrenu-
ous dimension to it, as part of the training 
of the future leaders of America." 

Athletics, Camp believed, could 
improve student decorum. 
"Since the dawn of athleti-
cism at Yale, all trespasses 
upon the discipline of the 
college have grown steadily 
less," Camp noted in his 
book Yak: Ha Campus, H" 
Classrooms, H~r Athl~tics. 

Football promised to pro-
vide an outlet for the aggres-
sion that Camp believed was 
latent in the American psy-
che. "The average American 
has a strain in his blood, 
coming down to him 
through rugged ancestors, 
that 
gives 
him 
an 
unquenchable lust for 
uncivilized places," he wrote. 

Such aggression could be 
channded only on the foot-
ball field, creating young 
men of temperance and 
civility. "Best of all is the 
establishment of an all-
around standard of clean 
morals and health, and an esprit de corps 
that carries the typical Yale man far." 

Athletics may have hd~ foster disci-
pline and moral standards away from the 
playing fields, but the games themselves 
ofTen degenerated into violence. When 
Yale and Pennsylvania met in 1893, 17 
players received serious injuries, including 
one who emerged from the &ay with tooth 
marks on his back. The Yale-Harvard 
game of 1894 sparked fist-fights among 
the rival students on the way out of the 
park. "No father or mother worthy of the 
name would permit a son to associate with 
the Yale brutes," stormed a New iOrk Post 
editorial that year. 

The 1905 college football season wit-
nessed 149 injuries and 18 deaths through-
out the country. The ensuing national out-
rage prompted President Roosevelt to 
summon Camp, along with representatives 
from Harvard arid Princeton, to a confer-
ence at the White House. In response to a 
proposal by Camp and Alexander MofFat 
of Princeton, delegates from 28 colleges 
met to create the National College Athletic 
Association. The committee endeavored to 
reduce football injuries by requiring impar-
tial referees and designating violent acts as 
fOuls subject to penalties. Camp served on 
the NCAA football rules committee until 
his death in 1925. 

Despite the violence of many early 
games, Camp's idealism never wavered. 
According to his writings, his message of 
sportsmanship was not lost on Yale stu-
dents. In 1898, Harvard triumphed easily 
over the Yale Blue. "The result was so man-
ifesdy a logical one as to leave no ground 
ror cavil," Camp recalled. "In fact the con-
gratulations extended to Harvard carne 
from no sincerer source than from the Yale 
players themselves and the Yale body in 
General." 

And ifYale srudents could be gentle-
men in defeat, they certainly were gracious 
in victory-as the game two weeks ago 
illustrates.
