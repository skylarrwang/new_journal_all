"Although the Japanese bombers 
didn't fly over often, we never knew 
when they would come," recalled 
McCabe, who taught at the wartime 
Yuanling location. "Electricity was 
undependable, inflation was rampant, 
and the enemy planes once dropped 
bubonic plague capsules in the rice pad-
dies downriver." 

By the time World War II ended, 
Japanese bombers had reduced many of 
the campus buildings in Changsha and 
Wuhan to rubble. "The immediate 
effort at the end of the war was to repair 
the physical damage and carry on with 
the educational and medical work," said

schools, civil war rocked China. 
Victorious Communist armies arrived 
in Changsha in August 1949. Although 
the trustees tried to work with the new 
regime, hostile bureaucrats and radical 
students exacerbated the tension. In the 
end, Communist pressure and the 
Korean War made carrying on impossi-
ble. The skeletal American staff that 
remained after Liberation departed one 
by one. 

But even leaving was not so easy. 
When Dr. Dwight Rugh attempted to 
exit the Mainland in 1951, the govern-
ment held him for a year, subjected him 
to a "denunciation meeting," and finally 
deported him. When he got to the 
Hong Kong border, the PRC guard, a 
Yali Middle School graduate, recognized 
the doctor and waved him through 
without checking his luggage. "In Hong 
Kong, Rugh opened his suitcase and 
discovered that a radio transmitter had 
been planted in it," said Reese. "They'd 
been planning on creating a disturbance 
at the border and perhaps arresting 
him." Rugh's narrow escape brought an 
end to Yale-in-China's first stint on the 
Mainland. 

Yale-in-China chose to start anew 
in Hong Kong and gave monetary and 
faculty support to New Asia College. Set 
up after Liberation by refugee professors 
from the Mainland, New Asia's "cam-
pus" in 1953 consisted of a tiny three-
room flat in the slums of Kowloon, 
Hong Kong. From these inauspicious 
beginnings, New Asia developed into a 
respected institution that numbered 
Yale graduates among its English lan-
guage instructors. When the British 
government united the prestigious col-
lege with two other schools to form the 
Chinese University of Hong Kong in 
1963, Yale-in-China continued to 
administer the New Asia component. 

During the Hong Kong years, the 
trustees renamed the Association once 
again, calling it simply the Yale-China 
Association. 

As it put down new roots in Hong 
Kong, the Association also kept a dose 
watch on the situation in China. The 
Sino-American thaw of the early 1970s 
presented an opportunity to return to 
the mainland, and the Association 
began tentative attempts to restore old 
connections. The United States and 
China officially normalized relations in 
1979, and the first Yale instructors 
arrived in the PRC for tlie 1980 fall 
term. Working as English language 
instructors, the Yale graduates often 
taught in schools with old Yale-in-
China affiliations. 

The PRC, which had been isolated 
from the West for most of the Mao 
Zedong years, challenged the new 
teachers culturally and politically. 
"There were only ten or eleven 
Westerners in the city of a million peo-
ple, so most of our students had no 
experience with foreigners and were very 
curious about us in a friendly way," 
recalled David Jones (PC '80), an 
English language teacher at Changsha's 
1-Iunan Medical University from 1980-
82. "But despite our friends' good will, 
the ebb and flow of the Party's 'Anti-
Spiritual Pollution' and 1\nti-Bourgeois 
Liberalism' campaigns sometimes 
caused problems. Officials would tell 
our students and friends not to have 
anything to do with us except in the 
necessary professional sense." 

Although founded on repression, 
the relative stability of the Communist 
state has enabled Yale-China to put 
down somewhat secure roots on the 
Mainland. The bloody 1989 incidents 
shocked the Association into removing 
its teachers for a st;mester, but they 
returned in the spring of 1990. "The 
difficulties posed by the Tiananmen 
((There were only ten or 
eleven Ulesterners in the 
city of a million people. >> 
crackdown were extreme but not 
unique," explained Reese. "The political 
situation is a recurring issue that all of 
the U.S.-Chinese exchange programs 
have to address." 

Indeed, the upheaval in China 
shows no signs of ending. The immi-
nent death of the country's elderly but 
powerful leader, Deng Xiaoping, could 
provoke another round of protests, 
demonstrations, or civil unrest. "Events 
on the Mainland will continue to pre-
sent difficult issues and create problems 
for the Yale-China participants," said 
Reese. "The program is extremely 
rewarding, but not always easy or com-
fortable. There are times when seeing it 
through to the end requires some com-
mitment to the idea of providing a ser-
vice." After 90 years in tumultuous 
China, the Association continues to 
cherish that ideal.
