In an age of electron microscopes and 
computer models, teaching human 
development with embalmed fetuses 
may seem primitive. But Professor 
Emeritus Edmund Crelin's collection 
of 30 malformed human fetuses, 
housed at the Yale Medical School, 
promotes a sobering awareness of the 
human side of medicine. "First you 
think, this 
is 
intriguing," said 
Brian 
Adams 
(MED 
'95). 
"Then you realize that 
beyond the science of it 
all, you have to deal with 
human emotions, because 
these things were born to 
real people. You realize 
your responsibility." 

The 
collection 
enables students to come 
face to face with what can 
go wrong in human devel-
opment. But few medical 
students take advantage of 
the collection. Dr. C relin 
feels this neglect reflects a 
pervasive over-emphasis in 
current medical education 
on the theoretical and the 
microscopic. 

When he arrived at 
Yale in 1947, Dr. Crelin 
found a handful of normal 
and malformed fetal spec-
imens lying neglected in a 
basement, where some 
already had dried out. He 
restored as many specimens as he 
could, and over the years he acquired 
more through donations from parents 
and hospitals all over the region. H e 
possesses some rare specimens: the 
cyclops, with its two eyes merged into 
one; the sirenomelous, or mermaid, 
with its legs fused together; the cran-
ioschitic, with its rudimentary brain 
exposed through an opening in its 
skull. 

According to Dr. Crelin, the col-
lection offers students a valuable tool 
for the study of fetal development. 
"The beauty is that I can give a talk 
and then say, 'now go upstairs and 
look at that 8-weeker over there,'" said 
Dr. Crelin. The results for prenatal 
tests such as amniocentesis and ultra-
sound hang next to some fetuses, so 
that students can see exactly how the 
problems indicated in the tests take 
shape. 

The collection's emotional impact 
ensures that its value transcends the 
technical. "It punches you in the stom-. 
ach," said Nicholas Muellner (DC 
'91). "It gives you a real awareness of 
the process of being created. You did 
not come together in a vacuum." 

Dr. Crelin complains, however, 
that his collection represents a flesh-
and-blood approach to medical educa-
tion that has gone out of fashion. The 
number of hours students spend on 
dissections has declined over the years, 
as schools shift attention and resources 
to more theoretical subjects like cell 
biology. "If I talk to students about 
microbiology, their eyes sparkle," said 
Dr. Crelin. "But talk about a bone and 
they're not interested." 

In 1989 the department moved 
the malformed specimens from an 
open hallway, where they stood next to 
the normal ones, to the locked,
