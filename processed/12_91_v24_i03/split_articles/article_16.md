current exhibitio n at New York's Museum of 
Modern Art (MOMA) testifies to the visibility and 
uccess of Yale's graduate program in photography. 
The show, called "Pleasures and Terrors of Domestic 
Comfort," examines American photography since 1980 
with over 150 photographs by about 70 artists. Nine of the 
exhibiting photographers studied in the Yale program, and 
they created many of their works in the show as students 
here. "Yale's graduates tend to. be very sophisticated techni-
cally," said Peter Galassi, director of MOMA's photography 
department and curator of the show. "Yale has a distin-
guished faculty and has attracted a number of excellent 
young photographers." Although only 90 students have 
come through Yale's program since its inception in 1970, 
Yale graduates claim a prestigious spot among contempo-
rary American photographers. 
Many photographers come to Yale's graduate program 
after years of work on their own. "Yale wants you to take 
time off and experience the world," said Rita Fusaro (ART 
'92), .at 24 one of the program's youngest students. "The 
average age of the students here is probably 27 to 29." 
Many students say they came to Yale after working alone
