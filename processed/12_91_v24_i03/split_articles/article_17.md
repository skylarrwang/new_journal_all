because of the intense critical environment the program 
provides. While other schools focus on art theory, Fusaro 
said, Yale emphasizes analysis of the students' own work by 
peers and professors. 

"Yale has the best resources and the best faculty," said 
Dawoud Bey (ART '93). The Yale photography program 
boasts prominent artists such as Tod Papageorge, director of 
the graduate program since 1978, and Richard Benson, 
famous for his excellent photographic reproductions and 
darkroom techniques. 

The reputation of the Yale faculty attracts talented pho-
tographers who want to strengthen their foundation in 
"straight," or traditional, photography. "Every year we get 
applications from the strongest young straight photogra-
phers around the country," said Papageorge, who taught all 
nine Yale artists in the New York show. "They see Yale as a 
bright light in theÂ· study of straight photography." 

Steve Ahlgren (ART '92) describes photography today 
as divided into two schools-modernist and postmodernist. 
Ahlgren identifies Yale with modernism, a straight approach 
to photography. "I often hear Yale professors say they are 
most interested in how the lens describes the world," he 
said. Postmodernist photography arose in the early 80s as a 
reaction to the modern tradition of photography and often 
combines photographic images with other media such as 
paint and drawings. 

While the distinction between modernist and post-
modernist photography has been a cliche for 
early a decade, many believe that boundaries 
between the two have begun to fade. "I resist the simplicity 
of that dichotomy," said MOMA's Galassi. "For a while 
there was mutual alienation [between self-described mod-
ernists and postmodernists], but it's a crude distinction 
that's becoming less and less useful." 

Yale still draws some criticism from the photography 
world for its conservatism. Papageorge, however, finds Yale's 
focus on traditional techniques a bonus. "Because the pro-
gram is small, it's appropriate for us to be good in one 
thing," Papageorge said. "We can't be all things to all peo-
ple." In addition, he feels that the label "straight photogra-
phy" oversimplifies the philosophy of the department and 
dismisses the creativity that goes on within the limits of tra-
ditional photography. Papageorge encourages students to 
challenge themselves in order to hone their photographic 
vision. "You really don't want to keep doing what you do 
well," he told a student during a critique. "The only way 
you can learn is through a form of self-destruction." 

The work of Party Anos (ART '83), now an instructor 
of introductory-level photography, deviated from straight 
photography even during her years as a Yale graduate stu-
dent. Anos composed a mural collage for her graduate thesis 
project. The collage consisted of several media, including 
photography, paint, and spray paint. "The faculty accept 
work outside the tradition and support it," Anos said. 
"They were able to deal with my work." 

Some members of the department believe that Yale has 
reached a transitional phase. "I think that this year the 
school is starting to break out of its modernist stage," said 
Charlotte Dixon (ART '92). "Postmodernism is pretty 
much dissolving and people are searching for a new idiom." 

Lois Connor (ART '81), now an assistant professor in 
photography, agrees that Yale is expanding beyond its mod-
ernist origins. "My work is certainly rooted in modernist 
tradition, which is why I came to Yale," she said. "The 
whole art school in general is modernist, but it's pushing the 
boundaries." 

Yale's two-year graduate photography program, a 
branch of the School of Art, includes instruction in dark-
room techniques as well as photographic history and criti-
cism. Critiques, where resident and visiting faculty convene 
to discuss students' work, provide a forum for ideas and a 
source of feedback. Generally in a critique, three of the six-
teen graduate students display a dozen of their photographs 
on the bulletin-boarded walls in a basement room of the Art 
and Architecture building. Students discuss each others' 
work, attempting to understand a photograph's message. 

Anos found the critiques essential to her graduate study. "In 
an unfavorable critique, it helped if I distanced myself," she 
remembered. "I found that usually there's a lot of truth to 
what is said." 

Stereotypes of "modernist" and "postmodernist" pho-
tography persist despite a growing conviction that today's 
photographers do not fit into such easy molds. And the 
MOMA exhibition demonstrates that no single style distin-
guishes Yale's graduates from other artists. "People's percep-
tions are that the graduate program is a bastion of straight 
photography," said Papageorge. "The show at MOMA pro-
vides a good example of Yale photography. These photogra-
phers all do straight pictures, unmanipulated, but beyond 
that each has an individual style." Perhaps with the passage 
of what MOMA's Galassi terms the postmodernist "band-
wagon," the photography world will recognize not only 
Yale's excellence within a specific tradition, but also the cre-
ativity and individualism that the school fosters.
