EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
To the Editor: 
I was favo rably impressed by the 
October 18 issue, especially by the 
pieces on the mayoral race and the Art 
Gallery. In fact, I briefly visited the 
Gallery during a visit and couldn't 
understand why the sculpture gallery 
was empty! I was depressed to find out 
it wasn't empty after all.
