**New Haven's AIDS Brigade**
**Author: David Suisman**
**Page number(s): 10-11**

jon Parker and Kelly Graham, recovered IV drug users, exchange needles for the 
AIDS Brigade. Graham once ran a shooting gallery. 
cion program, after which he entered 
college (using the high school equiva-
lency diploma he earned in jail) to 
pursue a career as a doctor. "I'm really 
lucky I got a second chance. Most guys 
don't," he reflected. Jon is now writing 
an autobiography called From jail to 
Yale. "I hope the book may serve as an 
inspiration to other drug addicts who 
want to change their lives," he said. 
Despite the drastic changes in his 
lifestyle, Jon still seems most comfort-
able on the street. He would rather 
spend his afternoons shadow-boxing 
with a friend on Dixwell than fighting 
through the "bureaucratic bullshit" of 
New Haven public administration. 
The Brigade, however, may suffer from 
Jon's reluctance to wade through the 
city's red tape. Jim Voltz, spokesman 
for Boston's AIDS Action Committee, 
told the magazine In These Times, 
"He's a prophet in our time, although 
I wouldn't necessarily hire a prophet to 
run an organization." 
No one in New. Haven .shoots 
heroin. Instead, local IV drug users 
rely on a synthetic narcotic called p-
dope, approximately four times as 
strong as heroin, which they often 
mix with cocaine to form "speed-
balls." "P-dope is more devastating, 
and harder to kick than heroin," said 
Brigade worker Kelly Graham, a for-
mer addict. Some attribute New 
Haven's inordinately high incidence 
of IV-transmitted AIDS to the addic-
tive power of the synthetic drug. 
"With p-dope, the need for a fix is 
stronger than with heroin, and that 
can lead to increased needle-sharing," 
Jon said. 

Despite their history of sharing 
dirty needles, New Haven drug users 
now actively seek clean "works" when 
available. According to a recent AIDS 
Brigade survey of local drug users, not 
a single respendent would share nee-
dles if they could obtain clean ones. 
Kelly said that IV drug users adjusted 
well to the need for safer drug prac-
tices. "They took it in stride," he said. 
"I know guys now who won't get off 
unless they can get a hold of clean 
works." 
This behavioral change blatantly 
contradicts social scientists' conven-
tional argument that drug users refuse 
to abandon the "bonding" experience 
of sharing syringes. "Everyone out here 
knows at least one person who has 
died from AIDS," Jon told me. "It's a 
basic survival instinct: people have 
gotten smarter and stopped sharing 
because they've had to." 
Shooting galleries are apartments 
or houses where drug users meet 
socially and shoot up together. One 
former drug user described the atmo-
sphere as "a party where, instead of 
talcing a sip of beer, you stick a needle 
in your arm." Even such environ-
ments, which once fostered needle 
sharing, have begun ro promote needle 
exchange. Some gallery owners now 
work with the Brigade to exchange 
dozens of needles at a time (often 
called bulk exchange) and provide 
clean works for their clientele. One 
gallery now changes about one hun-
dred needles every week. 
For many years the Brigade 
ignored the laws that prohibited pos-
session of needles without a prescrip-
tion 
in 
Connecticut 
and 
Massachusetts. In 1990, however, the 
Connecticut legislature legalized pos-
session of syringes for the purpose of 
needle exchange in New Haven-
though not in the rest of Connecticut. 
The AIDS Brigade's work on the 
~treecs of DixweU played a crucial role 
in the passage of the new law. "A lot of 
legislators were reluctant to repeal the 
needle ban," Jon said . "They were 
scared: what would their constituents 
think? But then they saw we had been 
exchanging needles for years. We had 
stats showing the efficacy of our work. 
It's a lot easier to get something passed 
that way." 
The needle exchange program 
that the New Haven health depart-
ment recently established now receives 
much of the credit that belongs to the 
AIDS Brigade. "They're hogging the 
glory now," Kelly explained. "We were 
the ones taking flak from the police 
before police chief Pastore and Mayor 
Daniels came in." 
Now the AIDS Brigade has turned 
toward the future. Jon hopes to open a 
storefront that will act as a base for the 
AIDS Brigade in New Haven and will 
create jobs for recovering addicts. In 
1986 the Brigad e operated such a 
space on York Street as an AIDS pre-
vention "shop" that provided supplies 
and information. The new storefront 
also will serve a positive social function 
for its patrons: "Drug addicts in gener-
al feel largely disempowered and alien-
ated," Jon said. "A storefront is a place 
where they can feel they belong, and it 
reminds them they do have a legiti-
mate stake in society. There aren't a lot 
of places like that. We're trying to help 
drug users in a variety of ways. 
"A lot of these people are HIV-
positive and will die from AIDS," Jon 
said. "For them, every time they make 
an effort to use clean works, they're 
doing something positive, taking 
responsibility for their lives. That's a 
good feeling. It's a start. For the other 
addicts, we provide clean needles so 
people won't get the virus; they're 
going to shoot up either way. We're 
trying to keep them alive."
