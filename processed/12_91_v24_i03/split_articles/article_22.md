the ranks rolled into Tiananmen Square in June 
1989, Yale-China Association teachers watched 
anxiously from their campuses in South China. Their 
own pupils were on strike, and the teachers feared for student 
safety. "Every morning I'd make a show of going to the empty 
classroom so that the leaders couldn't accuse me of supporting 
the students, which might have gotten them into trouble," 
said Michael Wishnie (MC '87), a Yale-China teacher at 
Huazhong Normal University in Wuhan from 1987-89. "My 
days were spent trying to look inconspicuous while watching 
the demonstrations, where the secret police would take my 
picture constantly." 

Soldiers surrounded Wuhan at the same time that the 
army crushed the movement in Tiananmen. "Students 
were afraid that the troops would come into the city and shoot 
them," Wishnie recalled. "Fifty thousand students just got on 
buses, on trains, or walked out of the city. The Yale-China 
teachers decided that it was time to go if the students didn't 
think it was safe enough to stay in Wuhan—it seemed like 
there might actually be civil war. We were totally shell-
shocked, not knowing if our students were alive or dead." 

While Yale-China Association staffers had warned 
Wishnie and his colleagues about arbitrary political repression 
and the low standard of living in the People's Republic of 
China, no one had predicted that student frustration would 
explode with such an impact. Still, to a program whose ideals 
have persevered through nine decades of almost constant hot 
and cold war, the Tiananmen crackdown presented just 
another bump in the road. 

At the turn of the century, a different kind of frustration 
grew into the violent anti-foreign, anti-Christian Boxer 
Uprising. The Western armies that suppressed the movement 
only aggravated the hostile climate in China when they 
imposed a humiliating treaty on the Empire. Still, the alumni 
who founded the Yale Missionary Society in February 1901 
pushed ahead with their plan to bring to China "Christian 
higher education in the arts, sciences, and medicine." 

With a few dedicated Yale alumni and a mostly Chinese 
staff, the Society's middle school opened in 1906. Operating 
out of the former Norwegian consulate building in Changsha, 
Hunan province, the school became known as "Yali" (an early 
Chinese transliteration of Yale). "Yali was patterned on U.S. 
prep schools like Andover and Exeter," said Donald McCabe 
(OE '39), a Yale-in-China teacher from 1940-42. "The stu-
dents who attended were always from Hunan's best families." 

Despite the missionary focus of the society, the trustees 
and school officials did not attempt to force Christianity on 
their students. "We wish to make this college an illustration of 
true Christianity," explained the Yali course catalog. 
"Nevertheless, the students have full liberty to follow their 
own religion." Proselytizing threatened to alienate the conser-
vative provincial and local governments—a foolish move in 
the uncertain political climate that surrounded the last years of 
the Chinese Empire. 

When it opened a hospital in 1907, the Society became 
well-known throughout the Changsha area for its free vaccina-
tions and treatment of opium dependence. Taking advantage 
of its reputation, the Society signaled its intention to stay in 
the city permanently by purchasing a site for a college, a med-
ical prep school, a medical college, and nursing schools. 

Unlike many other missionary schools, the Society wel-
comed Chinese involvement in campus administration. "To 
its credit, Yale-China has spent almost all of its existence 
administering its institutions jointly with the Chinese," said 
R. Anthony Reese (BR '86), a Yale-China administrator and 
former teacher. "By the 1940s, institutions were either run 
entirely by the Chinese or by joint effort." 

The Chinese reciprocated the Americans' tolerance. 
Unlike many other missionary institutions, the Yale-affiliated 
facilities remained physically intact until World War II. 
"Because the program proved its desire to serve and was 
respectful of the Chinese, they accepted it," said McCabe. 
"That's why its buildings survived through the political 
upheavals without getting attacked, looted, or destroyed like 
other foreign-occupied places." 

Such mutual respect reflected the Society's move toward 
secularization. After the turn of the century, evangelical 
Christianity declined in popularity at Yale. To reflect the 
change, its trustees renamed the Society the Yale-in-China 
Association in 1934 and dedicated it to education and Sino-
American relations. "A lot of the guys who went over to China 
weren't terribly religious, even in the early days," explained 
McCabe. "The new name made it official and pushed religion 
onto the back burner." 

After Japan's 1937 invasion of China, the need for sur-
vival replaced lofty ideology. "NO! Yale-in-China is NOT 
closed," reported the Yali Quarterly in 1942. "The urgency of 
the hour and the hope for the morrow justify our resolve. We 
find ourselves engaged upon a vast ministry of relief that can-
not be denied." Determined to continue their mission, the 
Yale-in-China Changsha and Wuhan schools evacuated their 
faculty and equipment to the south and west by barges, carri-
ers, trucks, and on foot. Only the hospital, determined to con-
tinue its work in Changsha, remained in the war-torn city. 
Fearing that the Japanese would bomb their buildings, Yali teachers held classes outdoors near bomb shelters during World War II.
