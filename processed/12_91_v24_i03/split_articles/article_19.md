articipating in our activities is a way to network 
because it offers connections to powerful peo-
ple," claimed Michael Granston, (LAW '92) 
co-president of a Yale Law School student group called the 
Federalist Society. "A lot of members feel that if they bide 
thei.- time at the law school there are significant dividends at 
the end of the tunnel." 

Granston's claim stands on solid ground. Founded in 
1980 by a group of conservative and libertarian students, 
the Federalist Society now boasts.a national organization 
with such powerful affiliates as Clarence Thomas, Edwin 
Meese, and Robert Bork. Although Federalists may see 
themselves as an embattled mjnority at Yale, their member-
ship offers dazzling career opportunities. At this year's open-
ing banquet, Law School Dean Guido Calabresi offered 
words of support and caution. "It's important that you real-
ize and remember what it's like to be in the minority, 
because in the real world you will be in the majority," said 
Calabresi. 

Weekly discussions on legal and political topics offer 
Federalist Society members relief from the law school's lib-
eral atmosphere. The Federalists also invite professors and 
outside speakers. According to Granston, Federalist meet-
ings allow freer discussion of potentially explosive issues. 
Members wrestle with questions like affirmative action and 
gay rights unconstrained by what they perceive as liberal 
antagonism in the classroom. 

Although conservatives and libertarians dominate, 
Federalists welcome all students, and some liberals and 
moderates do attend. "I like to see the Federalist Society as a 
forum for expressing different points of view," said 
Granston. "We are interested in addressing political and 
legal issues in a more intelligent manner than other stu-
dents, and we happen to be conservative." In a law school of 
600 students, the Society's 62-person mailing list and aver-
age meeting turnout of 25 lend it a significant presence. 

In 1980, a group of conservative studentsÂ·, led by 
Stephen Calabresi, (MC '80, LAW '83) Dean Calabresi's 
nephew, founded the Federalist Society in order to band 
together against perceived hostility in the law school. At the 
same time, fellow conservatives at the University of Chicago 
took similar steps. "In the late 70s, the students who formed 
the Yale chapter of the Society were genuinely fearful of the 
university's response to their views," said Judge Ralph 
Winter, a professor at the law school. According to Winter,


l some professors allowed liberals to boo those who expressed 
:o conservative views. "This behavior has ceased," said Winter, 

"in part because the Federalist Society pointed it out." 

In the ten years of its existence, Society ranks have 
swelled as the nation has jumped on the conservative band-
wagon. From a small group ofYale and U. Chicago Law 
students, it has mushroomed into a national organization 
with headquarters in Washington D.C. and chapters at over 
100 major universities across the country. The national 
office coordinates speakers and provides funds to its univer-
sity affiliates. It also sponsors a conference each year. 

Neither the national organization nor Yale's branch takes an 
official public stand on political issues such as abortion or 
the nomination of Clarence Thomas. Rather, each furthers 
its conservative and libertarian agenda by fostering a net-
work of judges, politicians, lawyers, and students. 

The Society's agenda places "traditional values" and the 
rule of the law at the center of legal thought. To this end, 
Federal~ts adYocate limited national government, the sepa-
ration of power, states' rights, and adherence to the framers' 
intent in constitutional law. Yet Federalists tip their hat to 
liberal perspectives by sponsoring speakers across the spec-
trum of political opinion. Last year's 1Oth anniversary con-
ference, held at Yale, featured both American Civil Libercies 
Union president Nadine Scrossen and former Attorney 
General Edwin Meese, among others, in a symposium on 
the Bill of Rights. 

Following the lead of the national organization, the 
Yale branch of the Federalist Society invites predominantly 
conservative speakers. This year's list includes law profes-
sors and circuit judges, as well as prominent conservadves 
like Imelda Marcos and Representative Gary Franks 
(R-CT). 

Yale's chapter, however, has shifted slightly to the left of 
the national organization because its presidents for the last 
two years have been libertarian rather than conservative. 
This spring, Yale Federalists plan to bring neat-socialise 
Senator Paul WeJlscone (0-MN) to campus. Granston 
wants to co-sponsor Senator WeUstone's visit with Law and 
Liberadon, a staunchly liberal law school student organiza-
tion. "I actively promote the relationship wich Law and 
Liberation in order to expand our base," said Granston. By 
inviting speakers like Wellstone, Granston hopes to draw 
liberal students to spark debate. "The Federalist Society will 
never be a voice for all students. But I'd like others to come
