**Foreign Students: A Rarity at Yale**

"Had I known there were so few international 
students here, I might not have come to 
Yale," said Indian student Rohit Bhanot 
(BK '94). Many foreign students at Yale echo Bhanot's 
sentiments. Compared with other top U.S. universities, 
Yale draws few of its undergraduates from outside North 
America. This fall, President Benno Schmidt asked the 
Committee on Priorities and Planning to study the role 
of foreign students and faculty at Yale. The committee 
hopes to address the issues of limited enrollment and 
financial aid and lack of support systems that have trou-
bled international students at Yale for years. 

Four percent of the class of 1995 comes from outside 
North America. Other Ivy League universities place much 
greater emphasis on bringing foreign students to their 
campuses. The University of Pennsylvania and Harvard, 
for example, identify 12 percent and 7.5 percent respec-
tively of their freshman classes as international. Even Yale's 
figure of 4 percent is inflated. Like other universities, Yale 
defines as "foreign" Americans living abroad or with one 
American parent. Most international students have one or 
two American parents, have studied in the United States, 
or have attended an international high school.


Many international students feel that Yale's tiny popu-
lation of foreign undergraduates undermines the educa-
tional purpose of the university. "This school educates the 
future leaders of America. Yale students are going to have a 
very provincial world view if they're only exposed to other 
Americans," said Lebanese student Zeena Zakharia (BK 
'94), co-president of the International Students 
Organization (ISO). "The subtlety of different values and 
customs isn't something that you can learn from a text-
book, only through personal contact with different people 
from around the world." 

In the race to attract foreign students, Yale falls 
behind at the starting line. Yale does not recruit interna-
tional students as other Ivy League universities do, and it 
relegates its outreach efforts to informal contacts with 
international Yale alumni groups. In contrast, schools like 
the University of Pennsylvania and Brown work intensive-
ly to bring foreign students to their campuses. Penn sends 
recruiters around the world annually. Universities that 
dedicate resources to recruiting top international students 
find that their efforts bring rich rewards. Harvard, for 
example, boasts famous international alumni like Benazir 
Bhutto, former Pakistani prime minister, and Oscar Arias, 
Costa Rican President and Nobel Peace Prize winner. 

If international students chose schools strictly by the 
brochure, then Yale would probably attract even fewer for-
eigners than it does. Students must fill out a preliminary 
application before Yale even sends out a regular applica-
tion. They do not see the glossy brochures that U.S. appli-
cants receive. "It is at this stage that Yale begins to lose out 
in the race to get the best foreign students," said Bhanot. 
"Dartmouth, Brown, and Cornell send excellent view-
books to every applicant. While Harvard is not so gener-
ous, it does send a colorful brochure. The first time I had 
a glimpse of the Yale campus was when I looked up 'Yale 
University' in the Encyclopedia Britannica after being 
accepted." 

Yale's reputation outside North America, Western 
Europe, and China (see story on page 20) suffers because 
of its limited international outreach efforts. "When you 
tell people that you go to school in the States they expect 
you to answer Harvard, Stanford, or Princeton, sometimes 
MIT," said Andrey Ukhov (BK '94), a student from the 
Soviet Union. "But if you say Yale, nobody knows what 
you are talking about."
