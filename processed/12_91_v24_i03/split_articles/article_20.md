Co-presidents Kathy Koenig and Michael Cranston hope to give Yale's 
branch of the Federalist Society a Libertarian tilt.

Lack of tolerance towards conser-
vative views at the law school contin-
ues to irk Federalist Society members. 
Although they believe their organiza-
tion has encouraged freer discourse to 
develop, some still feel under siege. 
"There is a tendency, even now, for 
liberals to shout down conservative 
speakers or call students racist and sex-
ist for taking a non-PC position like 
opposition to affirmative action," 
claimed Federalist Society member 
Eric Nelson (LAW '92). Co-president 
Kathy Koenig (LAW '92) believes that 
the dominant liberal tone of the law 
school can wear on students who hold 
other views. 

David Wycoff (LAW '92), presi-
dent of Law and Liberation, does not 
buy the Federalists' worries about the 
PC-police. "The people who hold so-
called PC views have no power," said 
Wycoff. He also questions conserva-
tives' claims that the liberal tenor of 
discussions marginalizes them. "The 
Law School discourse tends to be lib-
eral, but it's a very wishy-washy sort of 
Liberal," said Wycoff. "Those of us on 
the left are as far from the law school 
mainstream as conservatives. People 
who tend to complain about this usu-
ally can't stand the fact that they're 
being challenged." 

According to several law school 
professors, student reluctance to stray 
from the politically correct line has 
declined, as has the problem of stifled 
dialogue. "The media attention to the 
PC issue over the past year and a half 
seemed to liberate discourse to some 
extent,

Professor 
Robert 
Ellickson. "I find discussion in class to 
be quite robust." Professor Peter Shuck 
believes that the law school strives to 
foster a wide variety of viewpoints.
