iosphere 2, the $150 million greenhouse in Arizona 
that encloses a miniature world, seems at least as far 
from Yale's lnstit;ute for Biospheric Studies as Tucson 
is from New Haven. Earlier this falf the Biospherians waved 
to cameras as they sealed themselves inside their 3.15 acre 
domicile, while the Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies 
quietly took up residence in Osborn Memorial Laboratory. 
About the same time 
that Yale's new institute 
awarded 15 graduate 
research prizes, the 
Biospherians harvested 
their first kumquats-, 
grown in a completely 
self-contained environ-
ment. Strangely, enough 
both the research prizes 
and the kumquats ulti-
mately owe their exis-
tence to the bottomless 
pocketbook of Edward 
Bass (TD '68), the self-
described "ecopreneur" 
from Texas. 

Bass has used his 
millions-profits from 
his family's oil business 
and from his ranches in 
Australia-to become 
the nation's largest pri-
vate sponsor of environ-
mental research. Other 
Bass family gifts to Yale, 
from Edward's father 
and brothers, funded a 
new science building 
and professorships in 
the humanities. With 
Edward's $20 million 
gift in May 1990, Yale 
founded an interdisci-
plinary institute for the 
study of the global envi-
ronment. Yale's new 
program draws not only 
from natural science departments and graduate schools, but 
also from SOM and the law school, to support research and 
teaching about ecosystems and global change. 

Edward Bass's life story sets him apart from the rest of 
his family. In the early 1970s, adrift in New Mexico after 
two years at the Yale School of Architecture; he encountered 
the spiritual father of Biosphere 2-John Allen, a guru with 
a Harvard MBA who 
~ founded a commune in 
~ the desert. Refugees 
!'! from the degraded state 
-i. of Western Civilization 
l sought an enlightened 
i renewal in his com-
~ mune, named Synergia 
~ Ranch. Bass spent some 
~ time at the ranch's 
~ drama workshops, then 
~ gave his financial sup-
~ port to their work. 
Synergia ranch hands 
soon found employ-
ment helping Bass 
build condominiums in 
Santa Fe. 

Biosphere 
2, 
Bass's baby since 1984, 
evolved out of this har-
monic convergence of 
cult and capital. Space 
Biospheres Ventures 
(SBV), the project's 
parent 
company, 
employs John Allen as 
its research and devel-
opment director, while 
Bass serves as chairman 
of the board. A host of 
other former Synergists 
remain 
closely 
involved. 

Biosphmans harvest produce from their agricultural pwt. 
SBV has worked 
hard for acceptance 
from the scientific 
community, sponsor-
