ing conferences and enlisting project managers from the 
Smithsonian and prominent research universities. But it has 
worked even harder for public approval. Although Edward 
Bass himself allegedly keeps the lowest profile of any of his 
family, Biosphere 2 has steeped itself in public relations 
from its inception, courting media attention on a massive 
scale. 

Reporters, like the public, have fallen hard for the 
romantic vision of a man-made world. Stories in dozens of 
publications have played up the irresistible details: the five 
biomes (savannah, rain forest, fog desert, salt marsh, and 
ocean), the tiny plot of intensive agriculture, the miniature 
pigs, goats, and chickens, and the 3800 species of plants 
sealed inside. Skeptics as well as supporters of the project 
call it provocative, exciting, even revolutionary-a dry run 
for a space station or a mission to Mars, and a priceless 
..,pportunity to learn about the ecosystems of Biosphere 1 
(Earth) by trying to reproduce them. 

But more mainstream scientists, among them promi-
nent former Biosphere employees, level fierce criti-
cism at Biosphere 2. "The entire project is naive. It's 
trendy ecological entertainment-New Age science," David 
Stumpf, Biosphere's former air-quality task manager, told 
the San Francisco Examiner. His resignation in 1988 was 
part of a parade of disillusioned specialists' departures. 
Another who left was Walter Adey, director of Marine 
Systems Labs at the Smithsonian. "Biosphere had the 
potential to be the most important scientific project of the 
latter half of the century," Adey told the Examiner. "They 
simply underrated the difficulties of the project." 

Both sides of the controversy cite ideological differences 
between Biosphere's no-holds-barred approach and the 
more painstaking methods traditional science has taken 
towards recreating ecosystems. Ongoing efforts in tradition-
al research cannot hope to compete for attention. NASA, 
for instance, is working on small chambers containing 
chemically reproduced environments, which it hopes will be 
ready for testing by humans in 1995. 

Yale's Institute for Biospheric Studies aligns itself with 
NASA's more conventional approach. Bass's gift funds reno-
vations in OML, endows the directorship of the Peabody 
Museum, and forges ties with the Smithsonian and the New 
York Botanical Garden. But the Institute does not express 
any embarrassment at its benefactor's other biospheric ven-
ture. Graduate students use Biosphere 2 data in several 
research projects, and the School of Forestry and 
Environmental Studies is conducting a study of the carbon 
cycle in the miniature world. "Biosphere's potential is 
tremendous, because you have tremendous controls," said 
Professor Kristiina Vogt of the School of Forestry. "If you 
study a natural system, it's very difficult to control." Vogt 
said scientists can draw more conclusive results from experi-
ments in ecosystems whose every variable can be isolated 
and adjusted. "It's an interesting 
approach that most people can't 
afford." 

Biosphere 2 can afford just 
about anything. Not only has Bass 
endowed the project with almost 
limitless resources, but Space 
Biospheres Ventures designed it to 
turn a profit. Some critics have 
described the vast complex sur-
rounding Biosphere as a theme 
park. Tourists can look through 
observation windows into most of 
the habitats, buy T-shirts in the gift 
shop, sample the Biosphere Cafe's 
casual blend of southwestern and 
Continental cuisine, or even spend 
a night in the Inn at the Biosphere. 

In a rare interview about Biosphere 
2 this September, Bass told the New 
York Times: "It has been said in an 
accusatory fashion that this is not 
science or research, that this is a 
Disneyland. Well, it certainly is. 
It's built to attract people, to be 
accessible to people, to be fun." 

Skeptics charge that the fun, if 
not the tourist revenues, may 
soon come to an end. A recent 
article in the Village Voice accused 
top Biosphere management of bla-
tant fraud. SBV had violated its 
central premise, the Voice claimed, 
by enlisting the help of a machine 
in an organic cycle. The article 
described SBV's scramble to install 
a carbon dioxide "scrubber" inside 
the Biosphere, out of reporters' 
sight, when they discovered just 
before they sealed the Biosphere 
that natural processes could not sus-
tain air quality. Numerous sources, 
many anonymous, claimed that 
those who knew about the scrubber 
were 
sworn 
to 
secrecy. 
The 
Biospherians went in with the 
understanding, carefully concealed 
from the media, that even with the 
scrubber's help they would never 
make it through the planned two 
years. 

Space Biospheres Ventures insists 
that the carbon dioxide level remains 
high but healthy and has responded 
well to "ecological management tech-
niques," which include "some 
mechanical assistance." SBV's mighty 
public-relations engine, at least, con-
tinues to churn along. "Imagine a 
Biosphere ... " begins an awestruck 
SBV pamphlet, which features pho-
tographs of the Biospherians, spiffily 
dressed in red Star Trek suits, harvest-
ing corn and smiling at tourists 
through the glass. An upbeat report 
released November 1 said the only 
unforeseen problem involved a rice 
hulling device that chopped off the 
tip of Biospherian Jane Poynter's fin-
ger. Aside from her five-hour absence 
for hand surgery in Tucson, all the 
Biospherians have been carrying out 
their planned duties. 

"Biosphere 2 may prove to be the 
Kitty Hawk of biospheric life-support 
systems," Bass told the New York 
Times. He added that in retrospect, 
NASA's lunar program in the 60s was 
as vulnerable to charges of cultism as 
Biosphere 2. Whatever happens, the 
rest of the story will make for com-
pelling press-even if the public and 
the media grow more reluctant to buy 
the glitz. If carbon dioxide levels force 
the Biospherians to emerge in a blaze 
of humiliation before the end of 
1991, will quieter pioneers like Yale's 
Institute for Biospheric Studies be 
able to salvage the credibility of 
America's leading ecopreneur?
