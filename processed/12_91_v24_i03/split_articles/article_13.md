**Trading Needles For Lives**

**Page number(s): 8-9**

few weeks ago Brian Carroll and I stood on Dixwell 
Avenue, where we meet every Friday to exchange 
eedles with intravenous drug users. A young girl, 
maybe ten years old, noticed the box of syringes and the 
shopping bag full of bleach kits. "What are you doing?" she 
demanded. "Are you giving out candy?" Brian looked at her 
silently. 

When she repeated her question, Brian responded, 
"Huh? Why are you hanging around the street here?" 
"I'm waiting for the library to open," she explained. 
Then, a third time: "Are you giving our candy?" 
Brian stared at her. "No ... no," he said. "This is grown-
up stuff. You'll understand when you're older." Then he 
looked down and shook his head. 

I work with Brlan Carroll, a recovering IV drug addict 
from rhe D ixwell neighborhood, for the National AIDS 
Brigade, a grassroots group that pioneered an organized 
needle exchange in 1983. When I joined last September, the 
Brigade's director, Jon Parker, warmly introduced Brian to 
me as "one of the baddest guys in New Haven." 

I decided to work in a needle exchange program after I 
read an article in Spin magazine last summer, and I contact-
ed Jon Parker through a friend. As I waited outside the 
Daily Caffe ro meet him for the first time, two concerns 
weighed heavily on my mind: first, would the drug users 
harbor unbridled resentment towards me, this white preppy 
Yalie, and second, would they inadvertently prick me with 
dirty, HIV-infected syringes? I felt like I was entering a crazy 
world, and I did not know what to expect. 

When Jon arrived, I blurted out, "What exactly are we 
going to do now?" and he told me, "We're just going to 
drive up Dixwell and hang out with some drug addicts for a 
few hours and exchange some needles." I nodded. 

Approximately 2,000 people regularly use IV drugs in 
New Haven. City officials estimate that over one third of 
them are H IV-positive, infected with the virus that causes 
AIDS. Other appraisals place the figure closer to 60 per-
cent. The city has one of the country's highest per capita 
incidences of IV-related HIV infection, a category that 
includes mother-child infection and sexual transmission by 
an IV drug user. 

Tommy "Slim" Stevens, an HIV-positive AIDS Brigade 
worker, paints a grimmer picture of the Elm City's infection 
rate. "Everybody out here who's been shooting drugs for the 
five years 
has the virus," he 
told me one day. 
"Everyone?" I pressed. 
"Yep. Every one. Some of them 
just don't know it yet." 

When Jon and I got out of the car on Dixwell, 
people eyed me suspiciously but greeted Jon with a smile. 
We grabbed a box of new syringes, a shopping bag full of 
bleach kits (used to sterilize needles), and a plasric recepta-
cle for old needles. Jon introdu~d me to my AIDS Brigade 
colleagues. These five or six local residents help distribute 
needles on the sidewalk once a week and keep needles at 
home to supply IV drug users at other times. "You think all 
our work is standing on the street on Fridays?" challenged 
Billy Chapman, an AIDS Brigade worker. "These people 
out here know who we are, that we have needles, and they 
come to us at two, three, four o'clock in the morning bang-
ing on the window. And I gee up and give them needles." 

The AIDS Brigade aims co save lives by raising users' 
awareness of the disease. "Yes, we exchange needles, but we 
also try to educate people," Jon explained. "Most users 
know not to share needles, but we tell people not to 
share their water or their cookers [bottle-caps 
used to prepare the drugs]. A lot of 
them didn't know that when we 


While needle exchange programs deter new HN infec-
tion, they also combat re-infection by people who are already 
HN-positive. For drug users who cariy the virus but who 
have not developed full-blown AIDS, the needle exchange 
may save their lives; for drug users who have AIDS, clean 
needles may keep them from becoming sicker. 

Jon created the AIDS Brigade's needle exchange pro-
gram in 1983, while a student at the Yale Medical School. 
When one professor told him that drug users did not care 
about their lives and that any efforts at AIDS education 
would be wasted, Jon could not believe his ears. A former 
IV drug addict himself, he protested: he knew that drug 
users care about staying alive as much they care about get-
ting high. 

Jon began shooting drugs at 14 and later spent two 
rs in prison for a series of drugstore robberies 
committed to support his habit. One year 
Iacer, he faced a repeat-offender sen-
tence of five to seven years. He 
had his term commuted 
to admittance into 
a drug reha-
