D uring my s~nior year of c~llege •. I decided I wani:ed 
to be a poltce officer. Thts destre grew out of vol-
unteer work at Dwight Hall and developed during 
a summer at Logan Airport, where I worked with state 
troopers, DEA agents in dark suits and sunglasses, and 
small-town police officers. Police work seemed like a great 
life, a way to do well by doing good. All of the community 
development types I knew from Dwight Hall seemed so 
driven; they all had that awful something-is-hanging-over-
my-head look, which (having written a senior essay) I want-

ed to escape. I marveled at the fact that at 4:00 (or 1600, 
depending on one's world view), the state troopers went 
home and, apparently, left their work at the office. I had 
never heard of anyone doing that before. 

Police work played into my beliefs that building com-
munities was important, meaningful work. And it seemed 
like a steady job, an important consideration in a pre-gradu-
ation world of economic recession, internships, externships, 
and temporary stints in investment brokerages. My father 
would have preferred business school. "You might like it," 
he said. "It's very creative." I demurred and indicated that I 
would be miserable in the business life. "But," he suggested, 
"you could give to society. You could do what your Uncle 
Richard does." My Uncle Richard is vice president of 
Corning. I didn't think they wo1:1ld offer me that out of 
graduate school. I demurred again. 

But joining a police force meant leaving New Haven ifl 
wanted to escape machine-dominated administrations and 
police forces tied up in politics. I had begun to realize that I 
would miss the city terribly. I also knew that I would need 
not only to leave New Haven but to go far, far from New 
England. 

This requires a little explanation. After 30 years of 
police reform, most police agencies nationwide have 
divorced themselves from political control. Some depart-
ments ignore not only politicians but just about everyone. 
Separation of police and politics never quite happened in 
New England. Instead, old Yankee ward leadership has pret-
ty much retained control over the day-to-day operations ·of 
most departments. 

New Haven fits perfectly into this pattern. Innumerable 
minor sources of power, legitimacy, and comfort fraction 
this 21-square-mile city into 30 aldermanic wards and God-
knows-how-many sub-neighborhoods (43 by my last 
count), but they also form strong bonds between people, 
place and position. Ask any alder whether she's interested in 
the future of the city and she'll tell you, completely 
unashamed, Hell no, lm woking out for my ward. 

It took me four years at Yale investigating things like the 
Nighthawks playoffs and the Shameful and Ridiculous 
Budget of the Board of Education to understand New 
Haven's politics. New Haven became smaller and smaller-
everybody knew everybody else. Everyone had some deal 
going down in their little fiefdom that they didn't want to 
give up. New Haven was, and is, a machine city, and the 
machine ran in full gear then. Each ward was a well-greased 
cog in a machine built to protect the interests of the city's 
fragile and deeply interdependent coalition of powerbrokers.

The death of Vinnie Mauro changed all that. 
~ Mauro, killed in a 1989 highway accident, ruled the 
~ Democratic party. He single-handedly built a citywide 
~ slate of aldermanic leadership known, cynically, as the 
;; Democrats For The Future. Mauro intended them to 
J be just the opposite: a slate of alders who would stay 
Jl out of Mayor DiLieto's way and allow him to nourish 
~his coalition of old-money Democrats, development 
] interests, and neighborhood-based party hacks.

The Mayor ran the city through innumerable low-
level bureaucrats whom he easily bought and even 
more easily dragged into a cycle of dependence. It was 
a beautiful system, but it relied on the awesome 
charisma of Mayor DiLieto (who could charm your 
socks off between drags o n his ever present Winstons) 
and the ruthlessness of Chairman Mauro. 

With Mauro's death, the fabric of the party began 
to fray at the edges. The subsequent, sudden depar-
ture of Mayor DiLieto allowed an unprepossessing, 
honest Stare Senator to become the city's first black 
mayor. With John Daniels came a series of bureau-
cratic appointments that, alchough they lacked the 
flair, polish, and killer instincts of the previous 
administration, represented the city, for better or for 
worse. 

r was exciting. Everyone sensed the colossal 
impossibility of actually running a city by consen-
sus among the disenchanted grassrooters who 
elected the mayor. Bur ir all looked like irresistible 
entertainment. And it seemed like a noble project, the 
re-enfranchisement of literaily half of New Haven. 

At this time, I knew of the New Haven Police 
Department only through a study I had done of them the
