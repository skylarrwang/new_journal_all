each other once in a while. After some 
time, he staned coming to my room in 
the middle of the night, after he had 
been drinking. I would be asleep, and 
my roommates would let him in. He 
would get on top of me, waking me up. 
"He wanted to have sex, and I would 
tell him 'No' very forcefully. But he 
didn't care. He never hurt me, but he 
would hold me down and just keep go-
ing. He was so physically strong that 
sometimes it was easier to give in than 
to fight. I just remember feeling so ... 
powerless. 
"The third or fourth time he came up 
was the last. He got on top of me and 
started kissing me. I woke up and told 
him to go away; I told him 'No way.' I 
pushed him off the bed a few times, but 
he still kept getting back on. Finally, I 
told him I never wanted to sec him 
again. I managed to get away from him 
and went to the living room. He didn't 
try to stop me; he just left. 
"Though I knew he was forcing me, I 
didn't call it rape immediately. I as-
sumed things like this happened in col-
lege, until a friend of mine had a very 
violent reaction to the story." 

Unable at first to admit the true 
nature of the situation to herself. Sarah

willing to admit." 
never reported the incidents to any 
University officials. Believing that she 
somehow contributed to the rape, Sarah 
found it difficult even to tell her room-
mates about it. "I didn't want to em-
harass myself in front of them," she 
recalled. "They didn't know I was in-
volved in such a struggle. They thought 
everything was okay, since I wasn't yell-
ing or screaming. And I really didn't 
want them to think I was weak. In any 
case, I was afraid that they would think, 
'Well, you've been saying "Yes" all these 
other times, who are you to say "No" 
now?'" 

Two years later, Sarah has left the 
assaults in her past. While she carries 
few scars from the incidents, she is 
nevenheless wary of her old boyfriend, 
who is still an undergraduate at Yale. 
"Now, whenever I see him, I mumble 
'Hi.' If he ever comes up to talk to me, I 
just ... well, you know how it is when 
you 
hate someone," 
she said. "I 
remember I saw him once at a pany, 
talking to a friend of mine. I pulled her 
away from him and told her to be ony 
careful." 

Prior to her experience, Sarah, like 
many women here, considered sexual 
assault only as an external threat, posed 
by a stranger lurking on Wall Street. 
Members of the 
University com· 
\nunity-men who 
are friends or 
teachers-simply did not rape. Unfor-
tunately, intelligence and education do 
not prevent a man from acting on his 
violent impulses. Some men at Yale do 
rape, and their victims are often female 
students. Frequently, many of these 
women do not or cannot accept the fact 
that a man they trust has violated them. 
Therefore few victims ever report the 
offense, and rape at Yale remains an in-
visible crime. 

Tragically, an unrepo11ed assaull 
often leaves the attacker free to rape 
again. On a couch near Sarah, Joan sal 
quietly as her friend spoke. Last fall, 
Sarah's assailant attacked Joan, 
although she managed to fight him off. 
The two women had been friends for a 
semester before they realized their 
disturbing bon<J ~ One evening at dinner 
Joan told Sarah of a frightening en-
counter she had with an upperclassman 
earlier that year. Listening to Joan's 
story, Sarah blurted out the name of the 
man. 

Joan believes that Sarah was raped; 
yet, she nonetheless hesitates to call her 
own experience with the same man a 
sexual assault. Rather, Joan minimizes 
her ordeal, perhaps because it conflicts 
with her own stereotypes of sexual 
abuse. "Rape is such a strong word," she 
explained, "and I have a hard time call-
ing what happened to me an attempted 
rape. I mean, I fought him off, so 
nothing sexual happened. He held me 
down, and he did push me around, but 
he didn't tear off my clothing or beat me 
up." 

Joan's voice gradually faded out. She 
sighed heavily and resumed talking. 
•You see, it's hard for me to even think

about the incident. I blocked it out of 
my mind almost immediately because it 
was such a horrible experience. 
"It happened in the first or second 
week of school last year. We met on Old 
Campus, and started talking. After 
awhile, he asked me if I wanted to go to 
a bar with him and his roommate. I 
went with them. I mean, I didn't think 
twice about it. All I saw was a really 
neat, attractive Yale man. 
"After spending time at the first bar, 
we went to another one. Everything was 
okay so far. Then his roommate left. 
When. we arrived at the second bar, he 
started being very physical with me- in 
front of everyone. I kept telling him to 
keep his hands off me. It was horrible, 
and I was getting scared. I tried to get 
up and leave, but he wouldn't let me. 
"Later he wanted to show me the 
view from the roof of Bingham. I was 
pretty confused. I tried to tell myself, 
'Well maybe he's doing all this because 
he's attracted to me.' No one, including 
myself, wants to believe that something 
bad is happening to her," said Joan. 
"Anyway, we were walking up to the 
roof, when all of a sudden, he shoved 
me into the old observatory room. He 
blocked the doorway, and I told him I 
wanted to leave. I started to panic. He 
pushed me down and started kissing 
me, and the rest ... you know. It was 
such a physical and emotional struggle. 
"I kept telling him to let me go, and 
he kept asking me what was wrong. He 
kept saying we would be great together. 
I really can't remember how it ended, 
but somehow, I managed to push him 
off with my arms and legs. I ran to the 
door and went downstairs. He followed 
me and tried to apologize. But I knew 
he didn't mean it. 
"I didn't do anything about him," 
Joan said, "because I was a very scared 
freshman. I didn't know what was the 
right thing to do. I just didn't know 
where I could go." 

As is the case at Yale, few students at 
other universities speak out about sex-
ual assault. Those victims who do, 
however, have focused national atten-
tion on acquaintance rape in colleges. 
Recently women at several major in- . 
stitutions have brought rape charges 
against their attackers, both in universi-
ty hearings and courtrooms. Thus far, 
none of the allegations has resulted in a 
conviction of first-degree sexual assault. 
Perhaps the most notorious case in-
volved the University of Pennsylvania 
and its Alpha Tau Omega (ATO) 
fraternity. In February 1983, Penn of-
ficials began investigating an alleged 
gang rape involving A TO members. 
After several court battles the Universi-
ty and the accused students reached a 
settlement: the men had to read books 
and write papers on the topic of rape. 
Following a public out~ry over this ac-
cord, a second investigation resulted in 
a seven-month suspension of the (rater-
nity. At the time of the second Penn in-
vestigation last winter, six men at 
Southern Connecticut State University 
were each sentenced to several years of 
probation for their participation in a 
1981 gang rape of a female student. 
Though five were initially indicted for 
first-degree sexual assault, the charges 
were later reduced because the victim 
refused to testify due to the publicity 
given the trial. 

The growing awareness and in-
cidence of college rape recently haye 
triggered research on the subject. At 
Cornell University, Andrea Parrot, 
Professor of Human Sexuality, and 
Robin Link, B.S. University of Penn-
sylvania, began a study last fall of ac-
quaimtance rape in university settings. 
According to Parrot twenty percent of 
the CorneD student body has been in-
volved in either acquaintance rape or

multiple (gang) rape by acquaintances. 
The twenty-percent figure, she believes, 
applies to other universities, including 
Yale. 

Through 
her 
work 
Parrot 
discovered that many victims do not 
report the offense because of their un-
willingness or incapacity to identify 
forced sex as assault. The lack of 
violence in most acquaintance rapes, 
especially, contributes to a victim's in-
ability to recognize the crime. 

Refusing to face the anguish of being 
a victim, other women simply never ad-
mit that a rape occurred. "In the survey, 
women's answers would fit the descrip-
tion of rape, but they would answer 'No' 
when asked if they were rape victims. 
They're saying, 'I don't want to be a 
rape victim. I don't want to think of 
myself in that way. I don't want to think 
of a man I like in that way,'" explained 
Parrot. "Women don't want to believe 
that men they trust would hun them. It 
makes them vulnerable. That's why a 
woman often thinks rape won't happen 
to her." 

In Parrot's research men were also 
reluctant to view forced sex as rape. 
They frequently justified forced inter-
course because the women had express-

ed romantic or friendly inte1111it in 
them, or because they had paid for the 
date. The existence of prior sexual rela-
tions between a man and a woman also 
increased the chance of rape. "Men 
won't call a situation rape because a lot 
of them are playing by different social 
rules than women. They think that 
when a woman says !~o,' she's trying to 
protect her reputation and really means 
'Yes,'" said Parrot. "A lot of these men 
would be appalled if they were arrested 
the next morning for rape. They go to 
sleep thinking that they gave the 
woman a nice time." 

"In an acquaintance or date rape, the 
rapist won't take no for an answer," said 
Dr. A. Nicholas Groth. "He feels like 
he's in control. He makes the victim do 
what he wants her to." As the former 
director of the Sex Offenders Program 
at the Connecticut Correctional In-
stitute in Somers,. 
Groth 
worked 
with rapists for over six years. Stating 
that many differences exist among men 
who rape, Groth divides rapists into 
three primary categories: the anger 
rapist, the power rapist, and the sadistic 
rapis~. According to Groth coUege 
rapists tend to be power rapists unless 
they are retaliating against a specific in-
