increased defense spending. Well, that 
was done, and now, according to an in-
dependent study, [military] readiness is 
lower today than it was when Reagan 
came into office. 

Number three, deregulation. I ask 
people to look around at their phone 
bills, their natural gas bills, their light 
bills, and wonder how they're feeling 
about deregulation. 

The fourth thing is tight money. 
We've had relatively tight money and 
we know what we got. We got high un-
employment and high interest rates. 
Now we 
are 
having a 
robust 
economy; why are we having a robust 
economy? 

TNJ: I was just going to ask you that. 

BM: Because we have $200 billion 
dollar budget deficits. This is the 
greatest Keynesian recovery in the 
history of the United States. We are 
pumping up the economy with $200 
billion dollars of money creation every 
year. It's well known that this can be 
done. 

Now those aren't political answers. 
Those are facts. That's the economic 
analysis of what's going on right now. 
And it's dangerous, and everybody 
knows those deficits are dangerous. 

TNJ: But don't you find yourself in an 
awkward political position where you 
seem to be campaigning against a 
recovery? 

BM: rm not campaigning against a 
recovery. 
Pm campaigning against 
budget deficits that are going to wreck 
any recovery. 

TNJ: But you're going to have to con-
vince people that these deficits really are 
a threat. 

BM: If people are going to make their 
decision on the narrow question of 
whether Reaganomics helped them 
during this particular four year period 
more than it hurt them, that's a ques-
tion. I don't think people are going to 
look at it that way. I think what people 
are going to look at is, "Where are we 
going in the future?" 

TNJ: Voters tend to vote their pocket-
books, though, and their pocketbooks 
are probably more full now than they 
were in 1980. 

BM: Their pocketbooks are a mixed 
bag. If they're below the median in-
come, their pocketbooks are not better, 
they're worse. If they are way above the 
median income and they're rich, they 
are better ofT, but the stability of the 
economy is probably more important to 
them than the particular dollars they get, 
because they've got plenty of money. 
And the people who are the upper 
middle class, the people above the me-
dian but aren't rich, they've gotten 
some benefits and they've gotten some 
burdens. They can't get student loans 
any more for their kids, they're seeing a 
lot of problems in terms of household 
expenses, they see the environment in 
trouble, and they see foreign policy as a 
concern as well. I don't think that 
they're thinking the world is all rosy. 

TNJ: Ronald Reagan is expected to do 
very well in Connecticut, and that surge 
of Republican votes will probably help 
Larry DeNardis. What is the effect of 
DeNardis' seemingly close association 
with many of Reagan's policies? 

BM: If someone lacks competitive 
ability on his own, he looks 
to 
somebody else to win the election. I 
think that's the case here. 
Ronald Reagan is personally popular 
. . people do not agree with a lot of 
what he has done, but they give him 
benefit of the doubt because they like 
him. 

Pm not running against Ronald 
Reagan and I don't intend to be drawn 
into a race against Reagan. If someone 
wanted to run me for President, then fd 
argue about whether Ronald Reagan 
should be President. . 

I 
support the Mondale-Ferraro 
ticket. Irrespective of what people think 
aqout that, I lr.now I will do a better job 
of representing the Third Congressional 
district than Larry DeNardis. I intend 
to run a race in which people go to the 
polls on Election Day clearly knowing 
about the Congressional race as a 
separate matter. And I think that will 
fortify me against the possibility of a big 
Reagan sweep in the district. 

TNJ: Does the fact that Walter Moo-
dale never even came to Connecticut 
during the primary season hurt your 
campaign? 

BM: No, I don't think it means much 
at all. I did not endorse anybody at that 
time and I chose to maintain neutrality. 
[During the primaries] I did not feel the 
critical issue was whom we would 
nominate. The critical issue was, what 
are the issues upon which people will 
make their decisi.Qns in November? fve 
been saying this since last year and it 
wasn't useful to say Hart vs. Mondale 
vs. Jackson. I think I did a lot more 
good by talking about the issues than by 
just jumping on a particular band-
wagon. 

TNJ: Then why diQ. you endorse 
Geraldine Ferraro for Vice-President? 

BM: I endorsed Ferraro after it was 
clear that Mondale was going to be our 
presidential nominee. It was a sensible 
thing to do and it brought together 
politics and 
good policy at that 
time- and that's always an ideal situa-
tion to make a move. 

TNJ: Did you endorse her on grounds 
of experience or because as a female, 
Italian, Northeastern urbanite she's 
bound to help your campaign? 

BM: My view was that of all the choices 
Fritz Mondale could make for Vice-
President, the one that would do the 
best job of electing him was Geraldine 
Ferraro. 

That's what this is about. This is 
about getting elected. This isn't an in-
tellectual exercise. We pick people on a 
political basis to get elected and the 
grounds are, will they be capable of do-
ing a good job? And Gerry in my view 
is well qualified to be Vice-President of 
the United States and President of the 
United States. 

TNJ: One area in which you've come 
out strongly against the President is 
foreign policy. For instance, you spoke 
out adamantly against the invasion of 
Grenada. Given that elections there are 
scheduled for this fall, do you still op-
pose the invasion? 

BM: The invasion of Grenada is a 
classic case of "Do the ends justify the 
means?" Assuming-without knowing 
-that the people of Grenada are better 
off today than they would have been 
had we not invaded, that's true in 
many parts of the world, that with some 
luck the use of military power might 
replace a bad government with a good 
one. 

I don't happen to think that's consis-
tent either with international law or 
with our own traditions as best enun-
ci_ated to go around practicing gunboat 
diplomacy, invading countries we don't 
agree with and replacing their govern-
ments. 

Grenada was a little fly-speck of a 
COUntry-and we got away with it. Peo-
ple died, and people got hurt, and our 
reputation around the world was dealt a 
serious blow. But we got away with it. 

TNJ: Why did you vote against the 
most recent aid appropriations bill to El 
Salvador? 

~M: There was absolutely no restric-
tion on the use of the money. We are 
pumping more and more military aid 
ID!O a country that has a record of 
~ISUsing aid to oppress its own popula-
tion. Duarte may pull it off, but he will 
pull if off to our satisfaction if he respects 
human rights and implements land 
refor:m and starts negotiating with the 
guerillas. That's the kind of conditions 
that should be on our money; otherwise 
we're just throwing gasoline on a fire. 

TNJ: Do you think the President is 
serious about arms control? 

BM: No, he hasn't done what is 
necessary if he were serious. Yes, the 
Russians have walked away from arms 
talks but after they were basically given 
an ultimatum by the United States 
about what we would talk about and 
what we wouldn't talk about. We used 
bad negotiating skills. It does us little 
good to say, "Oh well, they walked 
away from the table, that's their pro-
blem. Screw them." That's ridiculous. 
Reagan is a total failure at negotiating 
with the Soviets. 

TNJ: For the Democrats, what are the 
crucial issues in this election? 

BM: If people look to the question of 
which candidate and which party has a 
clue as to doing something positive 
about our needs for the future, the 
Democratic ticket wins. The issues for 
the future are what are we going to do 
about the federal budget and who's go-
ing to talk turkey about the deficit? 
Who's going to talk turkey about the 
loss of industrial jobs in the United 
States? 

We're going to talk about foreign 
policy and whether or not we're going to 
build a foreign policy based on human 
rights and economic opportunity, or 
whether we're going to try to be the 
world's policeman. 

And we're going to talk about the 
arms race and whether we want to build 
a new round of first strike weapons and 
engage in "Star Wars" developments as 
our "answer" to preventing nuclear war. 

Irrespective of what you think about 
1976-1980, irrespective of what you 
think about 1980-1984, those are the 
choices for the future. 

TNJ: If re-elected, will you run for 
higher office? 

BM: fve got one goal and that's to be 
re-elected to Congress. And just like 
there was a time for me to run for Con-
gress, if there's a time for me to run for 
something else, I'll do it then. fve got 
no master plan.
