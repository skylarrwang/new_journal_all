**The Morrison-DeNardis Race**
**Author: Rich Blow**
**Page number(s): 8, 9**

In 1980, a time of GOP electoral vic-
tories nationwide, Republican Larry 
DeNardis was elected Congressman 
from Connecticut's Third District, a 
traditional Democratic stronghold. In 
1982 DeNardis was heavily favored to 
win re-election over Democrat Bruce 
Morrison, a former lawyer for the New 
Haven Legal Assistance Association 
and a 1973 graduate of Yale Law 
School. Even Morrison's own polls 
showed the challenger losing by. 30 
percentage points just six weeks before 
the election. But when the votes were in 
on Election Day, Morrison had beaten 
DeNardis by a scant 1500 votes, about 
one percent of the turnout. DeNardis 
had won all but three of the district's 16 
towns, yet a sizable loss to Morrison 
in New Haven cost him the election. 


Two years 
later, 
with 
Ronald 
Reagan back on the ballot, it is DeNar-
dis' turn to challenge Morrison. The 
election has attracted nationwide atten-
tion from political activists intent on 
maintaining or eradicating the 
Democrats' majority in Congress. The 
Village Voice, for instance, champion-
ed Morrison as one of 18 Congressional 
"Reaganbusters," while Freeze '84, the 
political action arm of the nuclear freeze 
movement, termed Morrison's race one 
of the 22 most critical elections in the 
country. For his part, DeNardis has 
won the support of prominent Repub-
licans 
like Gerald Ford and en-
dorsements from conservative groups 
like the United States Chamber of 
Commerce and the American Medical 
Association. 


Yet this 
race's importance goes 
beyond the realm of politics and the 
media. The two candidates differ fun-
damentally on the major issues of this 
campaign: where federal money will be 
spent in the next four years, especially 
in light of the current deficit, and how 
the United States will conduct itself 
towards its allies and opponents. 


The answers to these questions have 
concrete ramifications for the Third 
Congressional District. Cutting federal 
spending could mean cutting benefit 
programs 
for the unemployed in 
downtown New Haven. Raising taxes 
could mean impairing the growth of 
local businesses and the financial securi-
ty of individual 
cttJzens. 
Defense 
budget decisions can affect Americans 
in Nicaragua as well as blue-collar 
workers at weapons factories in Con-
necticut. 


The New journal chose these issues 
from among various others at stake in 
this election because of their particular 
importance to New Haven . 


The Candidates Speak 
Democratic Voice 
Rich Blow 
TNJ: In 1982 you won a very close 
election over a popular incumbent. 
How and why do you think you won 
that election? 
BM: Most importantly, I persuaded a 
bare majority of the people that I had 
more to offer as a Congressman than 
Mr. DeN ardis. The reason I was able to 
persuade people was a combination of 
things: I had a very good organization. 
A lot of people talk about grass-roots 
campaigns, but this was one in reality; 
there were literally hundreds upon hun-
dreds of volunteers involved in my 
paign. 


We had extremely good polling. We 
knew how to reach people on things that 
they cared about and it matched very 
much things that I cared about. And we 
had very, very powerful television 
advertising which, for a very limited 
amount of money, went a long way. 


The final thing to be said is that 
Larry DeN ardis thought he couldn't 
lose and ran a terrible campaign. 


TNJ: So that was his big mistake in that 
race, being overconfident? 
BM: Well, 
big mistake number 
one- the one that he could have done 
something about- is that he was over-
confident. 


The things he couldn't do anything 
about are that he really doesn't under-
stand things all that well and makes 
statements like "The neutron bomb isn't 
a nuclear weapon." That's a problem 
that goes deeper than things you can do 
something about. I mean, that's such a 
stupid statement. rm not sure he could 
have fixed that, but he could have fixed 
the fact that he was overconfident and 
that he treated me with disdain rather 
than respect as an opponent. 


TNJ: Do you have hard feelings about 
that? 
"fm not campaigning against a recovery. 
rm campaigning against budget deficits 
that are going to wreck any recovery."

BM: No, that's one of the reasons I 
won. I benefited from that. It wasn't 
credible to me. At no time during my 
campaign, despite the fact that I came 
from relative obscurity, did I really suf-
fer from a credibility gap. People did 
not ever say, "Wl\o the hell does he 
think he is, running for Congress?" 


They saw that I knew what I was talk-
ing about, that I had command of the 
issues, that I had the skills necessary to 
function 
competitively 
with Larry 
DeN ardis. 


I don't have any hard feelings. I don't 
have any hard feelings at all. I won. 


TNJ: What do you think the differences 
will be between this race and that one, 
aside from the obvious difference that 
you're the incumbent now? 
BM: fd say that over the two years be-
tween this race and the l~t race I have 
gained a tremendous amount in terms 
of breadth of support. Last time bus-
iness was uniformly for Larry DeNar-
dis. This time the business community 
is divided . . . some of them are for 
DeN ardis, some of them are for me.
