working with Copland, a man whom 
Rockwell described as "reticent about 
himself." Perlis said, "Sometimes it 
takes the catalyst of another person to 
make a composer remember ... The 
interviewer can ask questions that trig· 
ger a memory and bring forgotten in-
formation to the surface." 


Along with her Oral History work, 
Perlis, a fellow of Morse College, 
directs a workshop called "Musical 
Dialogues," which will take place in 
Morse on six Monday afternoons dur· 
ing the year, giving students a chance to 
meet performers in the New Haven 
Symphony. In all her work, Perl is 
shows great concern for learning. As 
she said about her Copland research, 
"You want to get below the surface ... 
The learning process is marvelous."

**Rewriting the Right**
**Author: Dan Levy**

The Yale Free Press is dead. After two 
ltormy years of existence, the right· 
wing newspaper, 
which facetiously 
eulogized Yuri Andropov as the "man 
who courageously stood up for the 
tecurity of international borders by 
shooting down KAL flight 007," has 
ceased publication. Ready to fill the 
media void is john Zmirak, BR '86, the 
controversial and outspoken former ex· 
ecutive editor of the Free Press. Zmirak 
and fellow junior Luis Ortiz plan to 
launch a new paper called the Yale 
Vcmpard, intended, like the Free Press, as 
an outlet for conservative voices on 
campus. According to Zmirak, the Van-
''""d will "change the 
liberal 
monologue to pluralistic dialogue." 


Zmirak and Ortiz, however, plan to 
avoid attracting the negative publicity 
for which the Free Press was infamous. 
'7be Free Press was a little extreme," Or· 
tiz said. "It attracted a lot of attention 
but people didn't read it seriously." 
Zlniralt agreed, "The Free Press made 
bold assertions but failed to defend 
=:::.We want a journal of politics and 
Zrnirak further contended that the 
F,. Prus "wasn't intellectually honest. • 
Indeed, 
in one instance, Chris 
John Zmirak 
Gram '86 charged that an article he 
submitted to the Fr~~ Pr~ss last spring 
was significantly altered without his 
permission and then published under 
his byline. According to Gram, a story 
originally intended to be a "non-
partisan, non-judgmental humor piece" 
on Democratic politicians was turned 
into a 
ridiculing attack 
on 
the 
Democratic Party and its ideals. "What 
got me upset," said Gram, "was that 
something that wasn't mine had my 
name on it." 


But alleged breaches of journalistic 
ethics apparently did not cause the 
demise of the Fr~~ Press. The staff of the 
paper, contended Zmirak, was very 
cliquish, and when most of the clique 
graduated last semester, there was no 
one left to print the paper. Patricia 
Webster, ex-Free Press publisher, would 
not comment on Zmirak's remarks, but 
an official from the organization that 
originally funded the Fr~~ Press thought 
there were other problems. Jonathan 
Cohen of the Institute for Educational 
Affairs, a neo-conservative group that 
also gave funds to the DarlmouJla Rroiau 
and the Harvard Sc.limt, said, "There was 
no sense of direction or purpose. It 
wasn't clear what they wanted to be- an 
essay journal, a tabloid, a focus on 
satire and parody or on campus events." 


Cohen also faulted the paper for prob-
lems of organization and succession. 
Nevertheless, Zmirak and Ortiz plan to 
apply to the Institute for grants to help 
publish the Vanguard. 


For Zmirak, Ortiz and their new 
paper, the next step is a heavy recruit· 
ment of the freshman class. "We think 
there's a lot of hidden con!lervatism out 
there," Zmirak said. If all goes well, he 
added, the first issue of the Vanguard will 
appear on October 25-"to celebrate 
the first anniversary of the liberation of 
Grenada."

**Soldier as Statesman**
**Author: Sam Os~**

Although in 1971 he led a group of pro· 
testing veterans who threw their Viet-
nam War medals on the Capitol's steps, 
Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor 
John Kerry '66 (TNJ, March, 1984) is 
now closer to his goal of working within 
that same building. After a solid victory 
in the September 18th Massachusetts 
Democratic senatorial primary, Kerry 
faces millionaire industrialist Raymond 
Shamie in the November election. 


Kerry's progressive liberalism contrasts 
sharply with Shamie's staunch conser-
vatism, offering Massachusetts voters 
two distinct alternatives. 


After leaving Yale Kerry fought in 
Vietnam, and upon his return he 
founded the Vietnam Veterans Against 
the War, a group which marched on 
Washington, DC, in 1971. This ac· 
tivism remains in his current politics. 
Kerry firmly opposes American in-
tervention in Central America, sup· 
ports a nuclear freeze and believes that 
cuts in defense spending can eliminate 
most of the federal deficit. To prove his 
words, Kerry produced a 40-page list of 
defense cuts totaling over $50 billion. 


He would support a tax increase to 
lessen the deficit only "as a last resort," 
said Alexis DeSeife, one of Kerry's 
press secretaries. 


The winner of the contest will take 
the seat of Senator PauJ Tsongas, who 
is retiring due to illness. The &ston 
GIDbe states that Kerry leads in the latest 
polls- not too difficult in Massachu· 
setts, which has four times as many 
registered Democrats as Republicans. 


Crucial for victory, however, are votes 
from the state's large Independent Par-
ty. According to DeSeife, Kerry's in-
dividualism should help him capture 
that vote. "Kerry never had a label, 
doesn't want a label and is his own 
man: she said.
