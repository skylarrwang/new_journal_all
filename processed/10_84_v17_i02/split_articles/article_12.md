"There was a time when people, because they 
didn't know how to bracket me, were really on 
edge. I used to play these clubs downtown 
and then would be setting church up on Sun-
day. It was very hard for people to under-

sion. I'm not limited by the traditional way 
that people see the church.

It's hard trying to describe Dwight An-
drews. Which picture seems "more

mornings in the All Purpose Room of 
the Afro-American Cultural Center 
(the House), a dark brown-skinned

a Paul Robeson poster among pictures 
of other black 
historical 
figures 
represents a tradition that Andrews 
continues at Yale. 

Late one Friday Andrews, decked 
out in a denim jumpsuit, saunters 
through an audience full of new faces. 
En route to the bandstand he grabs the 
hands of various people sitting around 
the small tables in a New York jazz 
club. The lights dim. He joins ~ 
members of his ensemble as they warm 
up on the stage. Earthy jazz chords 
come from tht· keyboards, drums, bass 
and xylophone. The musicians look 
stem and so does he. Sweat dripping off 
the side of his face, Andrews sips some 
water. "'ne, two, one two three" and a 
mellow sound drifts from the alto sax, 
blending with the melodies in the 
background. After a song or two to
