Yale or Death
"My life is ruined," screams a young
man grasping a rejection notice in his
hand. "I'll become agarbage man and
I'll live on 130th Street with 12 under-
nourished children and a domineering,
obese housewife with a big hairy pimple
over her upper lip. I'll die of banality!"
Sound bleak to you? Well, it seems that
way to the main character in Give Me
Yale or Give Me Death, a play wri'tten,
produced and directed by a high school
student from New York City.

Seventeen-year-old Alec Klein knew
little about Yale when he wrote his play.
As a senior at Stuyvesant High School
in Manhattan, he is only one of many
students
worried
about
life
after
graduation. But he wrote a play about
it, raised the necessary $1500 and pro-
duced Give Me Yale or Give Me Death,
which ran at the off-Broadway
Westbeth Theatre this August for seven
performances, five of which were sold
out.

As the title indicates, the main
character dreams of attending Yale.
"Yale is like the California Gold Rush-
everyone wants to go there. It's looked
on as a very desirable college to attend.
Yale is more symbolic than anything
else," Klein said.

His protagonist, 17-year-old Eugene,
wants to go to Yale and become a
playwright just as his deceased father
had. The play traces how Eugene copes
with his rejection from the University.
On top of this rejection, he must also
learn to face his mother, whom he has
not seen since his father's death.

According to Klein, Eugene's emo-
tions and attitudes are largely autobio-
graphical. "In one form or another all of
the characters in the play have been
part of my life," he said. He had actual-
ly been separated from his own mother
for many years. However, his father,
who never attended Yale, is very much
alive.

Klein, like Eugene, is seriously pur-
suing a career as a playwright. In addi-
tion to Give Me Yale or Give Me Death,
which he wrote in April1984, Klein has
written two musicals, one of which was
6 The New Journal/October 19, 1984
produced at his high school this year.

Klein is now just beginning to ex-
plore various colleges.
Is he as
obsessed with Yale as Eugene is? "Yale
does hold potential, but it's not a
definite," he said. "I won't know
whether to apply until I make a visit.
One thing is for sure, though: if I'm re-
jected, my life will be far from ruined."

On the Record
"I have a vivid memory of the first
rehearsal,"
recalls Aaron Copland,
referring to his organ symphony of
1924, "because, of all times, I was late
due to an unexplained delay on the sub-
way ... I was in such a hurry to get in-
to that hall that instead of going around
the block to the stage entrance, I
yanked open the front door of the main
hall. Suddenly, I got a blast of my own
orchestration! . . . I was absolutely
overwhelmed to hear it for the very ftrst
time. It sounded so glorious to me, so
much grander than I could possibly
have imagined." Composers have
always been able to speak to future
generations through their mustc, but
now their voices and personal reflec-
tions on their lives can also be pre-
served. Through the efforts of Vivian
Perlis, director of the Oral History,
American Music Project at the Yale
School of Music, famous composers
such as Copland, Leo Orstein and
Eubie Blake can be heard on tapes in
the Project's archives. According to
Perlis, "Sound provides a closer touch
with the personality of the composer
-'you have the immediacy, the spon-
taneity."

Perlis has recently received acclaim
from book reviewers for her role as co-
author of Aaron
Copland's long-
awaited autobiography, Copland: 1900
Through 1942. The book is based largely
on transcripts of Perlis' taped interviews
with Copland, who is 84. In praising
the book, John Rockwell of the New
York Times said, "The story of its
assemblage is fascinating in itself."

Perlis describes the Oral~istory,
American Music Project as "the first
endeavor to collect and preserve oral ac-
counts of personalities and events of our
musical past [and] the only full-time,
continuing research project of its kind."
It began with Perlis' work in 1968 on
Charles lves '98 who left his collection of
manuscripts and. papers to the Yale
Music Library,
where
Perlis was
reference librarian at the time. She
began to collect more information about
Ives in the form of taped interviews
with people who had known him, find-
ing that this method uncovered many
facts and anecdotes about the com-
poser. This information formed the
basis for Perlis' book
Charles lues
Remembered: An Oral History, which won
two awards and subsequently helped
establish oral history as a respected
technique in music history. Perlis' ex-
tensive work in the field since then has
included co-production of an Ives
record package and production of a
television documentary on Eubie Blake.

Copl<md was one of the first com-
posers Perlis felt was important to work
with: "Anyone involved in American
music is aware of him." Oral history
was a particularly good technique for
