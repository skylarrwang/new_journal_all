"There's nothing like 
a win to raise 
morale." 
University continues to want to build a 
responsible relationship." 
Wilhelm's own bargaining tactics 
have not gone unquestioned. A white-
collar union leader in the region pointed 
out that Local 34 may be trying to do 
too much at once. "In first contracts it is 
traditional to simply set out a working 
relationship with the University and get 
modest improvements elsewhere. The 
big issues-wages, benefits and so forth 
-are usually dealt with in later con-
tracts." 


The situation with the Local 34 strike 
can only make the Local 35 negotiations 
more difficult. "I hope it has no effect," 
said Donald Stevens, "but a strike 
always does damage to employer-
employee relations." 


"I believe that this strike will have a 
very profound effect on the 35 negotia-
tions," said Wilhelm. "If Local 35 
spends X number of weeks honoring 
the line, that will only increase their 
determination to achieve their own ob-
jectives." Wilhelm asserts that the 
University believes Local 35 will be 
worn out and broke come January. 
"Yale thinks it'll be able to call the tune. 
That miscalculation will result in the 
destruction of the entire school year." 


If Local 35 strikes in January, will 
Local 34 hit the streets with them? The 
unity shown in the first three weeks of 
the Local 34 strike leads some to say 
yes. "Because of the goodwill generated 
between the two unions, 34 will walk 
off: said Sirabella. "There's no question 
of that. They couldn't possibly not sup-
port 35." 


The strength of LOCal 34's internal 
unity, however, remains a question 
mark. By last week 41 percent of the 
C&Ts in the bargaining unit were 
Working, up from 37 percent during the 
fint week of the strike. The members of 
Local 34 also do not have the tradition 
of strong unionism that exists in Local 
35: even though they were not the ones to 
call the strike, 95 percent of Local 35's 
members refused to report to work . 


The outcome of the latest strike m ight 
depend on the Yale Corporation. "Some 
of the most influential people in the 
country sit on the Corporation," said 
Sirabella. "And they have interlocking 
relations with many other influential 
people. I have no doubt whatever that 
consitierable influence has been exerted 
on Cy Vance, Richardson Dillworth 
and the others to resist this strike so the 
anti-union pattern of the last few years 
is not interrupted. 


"The Corporation is not just an 
antique collection that is put on display 
once in a while," Sirabella continued. 
"They're important people and they're 
calling the shots. The President of Yale 
really has little to say." 


Sirabella points to the mutual sup-
port of the two unions as part of ~owÂ­
ing atmosphere of harmony among 
unions. "There is mo.re of a mood of 
cooperation within the whole labor 
movement now than since the 1930s." 


In the University's view, however, the 
cooperation of the two unions is far 
from crippling. Throughout the conflict 
with Local 34, Michael Finnerty, vice-
president for admi~istration, has said, 
"The University can hold out as long as 
necessary." He and others in the ad-
ministration say publicly that the addi-
tion of Local 34 has changed the situa-
tion very little. 


Sirabella disagrees and feels labor at 
Yale may be at a turning point. "The 
unity between the two unions can 
restore some kind of balanced relation-
ship which would hopefully end labor 
hostility at Yale. When Yale has the 
feeling it can stampede its workers, 
there's going to be trouble. If you 
balance the equation again, then people 
will start talking about issues. T hat was 
the dream throughout the '70s, and it 
looks like it is becoming a reality."
