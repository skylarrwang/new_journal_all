TNJ: How would the Grace Commis-
sion cuts, many of which deal with 
federal pensions and federal employees, 
affect your constituents in New Haven? 
LD: The problem is larger than any 
one subset of society. If we are constant-
ly going to look at one interest group or 
another, we will do nothing, we will be 
paralyzed. The problem must be ex-
amined in a forthright fashion. If it is 
necessary to implement practices which 
will keep this country from creating 
such enormous deficits that it will 
weaken the currency, weaken our posi-
tion in the world economy, weaken our 
position as a leader of the Western 
World, then I think that everybody may 
have 
to 
sacrifice, 
and 
I 
stress 
everybody. 

TNJ: If you were the president, and 
you were given the line-item veto, what 
kind of programs would you cut? 
LD: Well, I'm not going to project the 
next fiSCal year, but there were items 
like the Clinch River Breeder Reactor, 
which employs a technology that is an 
interim technology, and is 
almost 
superseded at this point. But because of 
powerful positions of both Republicans 
and Democrats in Congress from Ten-
nessee, the Clinch River Reactor went 
forward, and we spent billions of 
dollars. 

TNJ: You've mentioned special interest 
groups several times. Haven't you taken 
money from political action committees 
as well? 
LD: I take money from political action 
groups, that's not the issue. The issue is 
whether political action committees 
representing special interest groups 
dominate one's campaign receipts to the 
~ent that one will be seriously limited 
Ill one's ability to be totally free and in-
dependent as a representative. The dif-
Strence between Bruce Morrison and 
IDe on that issue and many others is that 
I am willing to put my money where my 
IDouth is. I've called for him to restrict 
bia campaign finances as I intend to. He 
baa of course refused to do so, but I am 
IOing to go ahead anyway. I believe 
that candidates should receive 50 per-
cent of their money from individuals, 
and primarily donations 
in small 
denominations, from people who are 
located in one's district. I think that's an 
enormously important principle, one 
that goes to the heart of representative 
government. 

TNJ: What about the argument that in 
certain cases, the power of special in-
terest groups, such as women's groups 
and minority groups, represent the first 
time such groups have had a voice in 
government? 
LD: What makes you immediately 
assume that the target of my concern is 
women's groups and minority groups? 

TNJ: I don't necessarily: those are ex-
amples. 
LD: I think it's wonderful that they are 
involved. I think it's wonderful that they 
support candidates. I have no argument 
with any of that. I'm talking about the 
net effect of getting two thirds or more 
of one's campaign contributions from 
organized special interest groups, those 
that wear black hats and those that wear 
white hats. They all have demands, and 
the understanding is that if you accept 
their contributions you are going to be 
indebted to that organization and its 
political agenda. When you add up the 
commitments, explicit and implicit, 
there isn't very much room for exercis-
ing your independence. 

TNJ: In 1981, you voted for the 
Reagan omnibus budget bill, which 
received a great deal of criticism from 
the press because it cut things like food 
stamps, 
student loans, and Social 
Security. In retrospect, would you vote 
for that bill again? 
LD: First of all, your information is 
wrong; it slowed the growth of the in-
creases in each one of those areas. ln no 
one of those areas that you cite did 
spending programs receive a 
net 
decrease; 
spending increases were 
restrained. In the case of student loans 
. . . what we did was to re-establish an 
income test, as the program was 
originally established. It was only in the 
seventies that loans became available to 
anyone regardless of income, and that 
was wrong. We try to focus our pro-
grams on those who need them, and 
that's precisely what we did in 1981. We 
don't have government services to 
benefit all regardless of their standing. 

TNJ: So would you vote for that same 
bill again? 
LD: Yes, I would. 

TNJ: Do you think that that budget bill 
hurt people in your district? 
LD: No, I do not. 

TNJ: I know that one important issu.e 
in the urban parts of your district is low-
cost housing, one area which has been 
adversely affected by budget cuts in the 
last few years. 
LD: Housing is an important issue; 
how we get it is another matter. We 
happen to be at a point in the debate on 
housing and public policy toward hous-
ing where the idea well has run dry. It 
doesn't really relate to Republicans or 
Democrats. There is a dearth of ideas 
about how to promote low-income 
housing. Many thoughtful people have 
come to the conclusion that 1930s-style 
public housing is a thing of the past and 
ought not to be duplicated again. I hap-
pen to feel that there is a role for the 
federal government in low-rent hous-
ing, I feel that strongly, but I want to do 
it· in the most cost-effective fashion. 

TNJ: Where does the defense budget 
rank on your list of spending priorities? 
LD: You may know that my opponent 
Bruce Morrison has consistently voted 
against all defense budget spending 
bills. This I believe to be a very ir-
responsible act. rm not in favor of 
spending large amounts of money on 
defense. I voted against the MX, the 
B-1 and a number of other weapons 
systems. I vote for amendments to cut 
the defense budget. But I voted in 1981 
and 1982 to appropriate money for 
defc:~se because I think it's important to 
our national security, and because I 
think it's important to the economy of 
Connecticut. If arms are going to be 
produced in this country, I want them 
to be produced in this state. 

TNJ: It has been noted that you voted 
in favor of researching the MX m issile, 
and against its production. Can you ex-
plain this reversal? 
LD: There has been no reversal. I have 
said right from the beginnin,g_ that I 
don't think we ought to prodbce the 
MX. But I came in to Congress follow-
ing seven years in which we spent a con-
siderable amount of research and 
development money on the MX. The 
only question I faced in 1981 was 
whether I should make an eighth and 
final commitment to the research and 
development of ·the MX missile. I 
thought that was the prudent thing to 
do, so that we would have on the draw-
ing boards the ability to produce such a 
missile if we ever needed it, so that we 
will be able to use it as a bargaining 
chip. I have never wavered in that opin-
ion. Once in 1982, after the election 
and before I was to leave office in 
December, Larry DeN ardis voted no to 
produce the MX. Larry DeNardis 
would still vote no, he regrets that the 
MX is being built and regrets th'at it is 
not being used as a bargaining chip in 
arms control talks. 

TNJ: What should the role of a Con-
gressman be in helping to end the arms 
race? 
LD: First of all, we've had a policy of 
deterrence, which over the last 35 years 
has at least prevented a world war, and 
certainly a nuclear war. It is said now 
that this policy will not be as useful in 
the future. I agree; I think we are enter-
ing into a new era where we will have to 
engage in arms control reduction. In 
the very first vote the House ever took 
on the freeze, I voted for the freeze. I 
also think that we should not wait 
around for the freeze to occur, because 
it may take a long time to get a freeze 
bill through Congress. It's important for 
the President and Congress to pursue 
many arm.s control options. We can 
deal specifically with command and 
control 
problems, 
we 
can 
deal 
specifically with ICBMs, we can deal 
specifically with pieces of the issue. 

TNJ: Had you been in Congress at the 
time, how would you have responded to 
the Grenada invasion? 
LD: First of all, instead of castigating 
the President within the first hour after 
receiving the news of the rescue opera-
tion, I would have waited and tried to 
get some information, rather than im-
mediately assuming that it was a hostile 
use of American troops, that the request 
for aid from a medical school was ab-
surd on its face value, that the long-
term effects on our relationships with 
other states in the Caribbean were likely 
to be disastrous. Morrison was wrong. 
The future has not been worse, in fact it 
has been made better. The Grenada in-
cident has sent a signal throughout the 
Caribbean that the United States cares 
for its democratic allies, particularly 
when 
they specifically request 
[assistance]. The amount of damage 
that was done was minimal, there was 
minimal loss of life, all of the Americans 
were rescued without harm and it cer-
tainly did send a message to the Soviet 
and Central American terrorist network 
that the United States would not 
COuntenance subversion and violence 
within this hemisphere .. 

TNJ: What should the United States' 
role be in Central America? 
LD: There are two factors at work on 
the crisis in Central America. One is 
the attack that is being orchestrated by 
Cuba and its patron the Soviet Union, 
and I firmly believe that democracy and 
political progress cannot be attained in 
that region until that security threat is 
gone. The second factor is certainly in-
ternal, that is to say there is a great ine-
quality of property, there is illiteracy, 
there is bad health, there is a weakening 
of the judicial system, there is certainly 
political instability and repression. I 
think the United States must aim at 
fostering decent democratic regimes 
through 
a 
policy of defense and 
development· of the region, including 
adequate military and economic aid. I 
would specifically reject a policy of 
retreat and defeat. 

TNJ: Would you ever send American 
troops to fight in Central America? 
LD: I can't foresee any situation where 
I would send American troops. 

TNJ: One last question. To you, what 
are the most important issues in this 
election? Why are you running for 
Congress? 
LD: The economy, Social Security, 
modernizing our defense forces. The 
economy, keeping it on the right track 
that it is on, dealjng with problems like 
the deficit, avoiding high inflation and 
high unemployment. Secondly, keeping 
Social Security and Medicare sound, 
hopefully by working with both political 
parties and both chambers of Congress. 
Thirdly, 
modernizing our defense 
forces. I think there is a problem; we 
really do need to modernize. I think 
there is a more general statement of 
foreign policy to be made: that we want 
to maintain our freedom in a peaceful 
international environment, in which the 
United States and its allies and friends 
are secure against military threats, and 
which will allow democratic govern-
ments to flourish in a world of increas-
ing prosperity.
