For Andrews, more work remains as 
long as distorted perceptions of black 
culture continue at Yale. The very ex-
istence of BCA Y, he said, "helps to re-
mind people that we still have race 
problems on campus. If white people 
don't acknowledge that they have a 
very hung-up attitude about race, then 
they'll never be able to move from it, 
and if black kids think that just because 
they are here in New Haven they can 
someho~ get away from who they real-
ly are, then they are also naive." 


Dwight interprets BCA Y as a spiritual 
forum for many religious, social and 
political problems. "You don't have to 
be black to be a part of BCA Y, you 
have to be able to understand the kind 
of 'black' struggles that oppressed peo-
ple face all around the world. Yale 
needs voices that aren't a part of their 
purse strings. BCAY maintains such a 
dialogue." 


Andrews acts as a nexus in this ex-
change of ideas, 
which 
reaches 
students, faculty and visiting intellec-
tuals. "It's been important to bring all 
of the aspects of my life into a dialogue 
with black thinkers who have passed 
through Yale. Hanging out and talking 
with people 
like Derek Wolcott, 
Baraka, June Jordan and Toni Mor-
rison- those contacts changed my life. 
When we start talking about the future 
of black people and the role of art in 
politics, I can hang. I am one of them. 
We share many of the same goals and 
interests." 


In all of these glimpses of Andrews, 
he is always with people. At the end of 
the church service, the members and 
visitors hold hands, forming a circle 
which fills the room. Voices join in a 
gospel song. Around the room, blacks, 
along with Asians, Hispanics and 
whites, sway to the music. Andrews 
sm iles, singing, "We~ve come this far 
by faith, leaning on the Lord, trusting 
in H is holy word, H e's never failed me 
yet." There is elecfricity: people, faith, 
community. And wholeness.
