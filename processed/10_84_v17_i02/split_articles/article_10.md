United They Stand? 
Tony Reese and Jim Lowe 
Vincent Sirabella built Local 35. When 
he came to the union in 1969, its 
members barely earned minimum 
wage. When he left in 1977 they were 
among the highest paid service workers 
in the country. H e returned to New 
Haven last weekend to view Yale's latest 
labor dispute, but this time Local 34, 
the offspring of his Local 35, was on the 
picket line. "It's almost a repeat of the 
prior three strikes with respect to Yale's 
indifference. You have a major world 
institution that can't deal with a large 
group of people it views as inferior to 
what Yale stands for trying to tell it 
what do do." 

Sirabella, now in his sixties, con-
tinues to expend his vast energy on the 
union movement. H e left the service 
and maintenance workers union at 
Yale, Local 35, after a difficult strike in 
1977 and is now national director of 
organization 
for 
the Hotel and 
Restaurant Employees Union, 
the 
parent body of Yale's two Locals. H e 
played a major role in the history of 
labor at Yale, taking his workers out on 
strike three times during his nine years 
as business manager of Local 35. 

In the 43 years of unions here, seven 
strikes have involved three separate 
unions. The shortest was one day in 
1941 and the longest to date was 13 
weeks in 1977. The latest strike differs 
from its predecessors because Local 34 
is one of the first large white-collar 
unions in the country. Nonetheless, 
without Local 35 and its groundbreak-
ing struggles with the University there 
would be no Local 34. 

"Local 35 was demolished in the '68 
strike," Sirabella said. As an outside 
mediator that year he saw Local 35 
crumble after only six days on the picket 
line. "Until 1967 there was an unspoken 
but very real trade-off," said John 
Wilhelm, now chief negotiator for Local 
34 and business manager of Local 35. 
"Wages and benefits were horrendous 
but the University was known as New 
Haven's most humane employer. Then 
the Corporation decided to manage 
their operations 'like a business.' They 
took advantage of a labor contract never 
written with an adversarial relationship 
in mind." 

The University had a different view 
of the situation. "We were in the midst 
of the first big budget cuts," said John 
Wilkinson, then dean of student affairs 
and now secretary of the University. 
"We had an efficiency expert in the 
budget office and he removed a lot of 
positions. Job security became a big 
cry. The cuts were really bad for the 
union, but they were tough for the rest 
of the University as well." 

The results of the 1968 strike forced 
Local 35 to rebuild. It brought in 
Sirabella, the most important labor 
leader in the city, with an eye toward 
the May 1, 1971 contract expiration 
date. 

"I was under the illusion," Sirabella 
remembered, "that if you approached 
the University with facts and figures, 
that as an institution with reason and 
liberal image, that would result in suc-
cess for the union. In an environment 
where light and truth are ideals, logical 
arguments based on documentation 
should mean something. It didn't mean 
a goddamn thing. I found there was no 
other way than to go to the street. 
"I'm not a hateful man, but I came to 
hate the arrogant attitude of Yale. I still 
have a sense of revulsion at the 
phoniness. They're uncaring, insen-
sitive, indifferent and impervious," he 
said. "I'd rather sit across the table from 
a whore or a gangster than Yale. At 
least they're honest about what they 
are." 

In a now familiar pattern the union 
asked for money that up to the day 
before the strike deadline the University 
claimed it didn't have. The University 
also refused binding arbitration. "They 
had to raise wages just to compete in the 
New Haven market; but I told them 
they couldn't buy a contract," Sirabella 
said. The union wanted more than 
money: health care, grievance pro-
cedures and job security. When the 
University produced a package on April 
30 that included wage increases but 
nothing else, the strike was on. 


The 1971 strike came in the midst of 
student protests over the Vietnam War, 
the bombing of Cambodia and the trial 
of the Black Panthers in New Haven. 
Wilkinson recalled leaving his house 
every morning to be met by chanting 
protesters. "They called me every four-, 
seven-, 11- and 15-letter name in the 
book. It is not a period I remember with 
any nostalgia," Wilkinson said. "There 
were moments that were really horrible. 
At one point a group of students went in 
and basically trashed Commons." 

Students flooded Pierson dining hall 
and let the air out of truck tires. A 
group blocked fuel deliveries on Science 
Hill, and 20 to 25 held a four-day 
hunger strike 
on 
Beinecke Plaza. 
Twenty-two were arrested on charges 
including attempted arson and assault 
on an officer with a deadly weapon. 

"The union got student support and 
manipulated it effectively," said Wilkin-
son. "But the breadth of the student 
response had been exaggerated. It 
wasn't massive support. It was intense, 
though." 

The union's effect was both intense 
and massive. The strike dragged on for 
a month and a halt into graduation. On 
Commencement Day Local 35 
mounted its greatest effort to date. Its 
demonstration forced then-President 
Kingman Brewster to alter the tradi-
tional route of the procession for the 
first time in over 200 years and severely 
disrupted the rest of the day's activities. 
A number of protesters, including 
Sirabella, were arrested. When the 
union threatened a repeat performance 
for the alumni reunions later that week 
the University informed them through 
the mediator that it wanted to talk. 
Within two days there was a contract. 

"The union was reborn as a result," 
said Sirabella. "There's nothing like a 
win to raise morale. We got a healthy 
money package and all the contract 
language we wanted." University of-
ficials agree that the union got most of 
what it asked for and more than the 
University had intended to give. "The 
wage increases were out of line in the 
New Haven market," Wilkinson said. 
"And they got the students in the union. 
I still lament that." 

Local 35 went on strike two more 
times in the 1970s. The surprisingly un-
eventful two-and-a-half month 1974 strike 
was resolved through non-binding fact-
finding. 1977 was a different story. 
Kingman Brewster had left and Hanna 
Grey was acting president. Many be-
lieve that the union felt Grey would not 
stand up to the pressure of a strike. "I 
think the union miscalculated on that 
one," said Donald Stevens, director of 
employee relations and chief negotiator 
for the University. 

The University had run a series of 
budget deficits over the preceding years 
and dug in its heels. The strike lasted 13 
weeks. "It was a disaster for everyone," 
Stevens said. "The union got no more 
than we had offered before the strike 
began. It was very divisive." 

The student support, which had been 
important in the earlier strikes, failed to 
develop. "I'm tired of paying increases 
in tuition every year," one student told 
the Yale Daily News. Sirabella noticed 
the change. He said at the time, "The 
students don't give two shits about the 
workers or New Haven. They look 
down their noses at workers." 

The strikes of the 1970s provided a lot 
of lessons for the labor movement at 
Yale. After the devastation of the 1977 
strike, Local 35 elected new leadership 
in 1978, bringing in as its business 
manager John Wilhelm '67, a former 
activist in the Yale chapter of the 
Students for a Democratic Society. 

But relations between the union and 
University changed little. They reached 
two agreements in 1980 and 1982 
without a strike. Stevens points to these 
seven strike-free years and claims that 
the University has begun to build a 
responsible relationship with the union. 
Wilhelm disagrees. "The University has 
never been willing to develop a func-
tional labor relations policy. If Cy 
Vance had negotiated this way in Paris, 
the US Army would still be in 
Vietnam." 

The 1977 strike showed many in 
Local 35 that their strike weapon was 
only partially effective. That union con-
sists of only 1300 of Yale's 9000 
employees, and as Wilhelm said in 
1981, "We don't have the power to cripple 
the University. Our strikes harass 
the University, 
inconvenience 
University, embarrass the University, 
but just in terms of raw power the fact is 
we can't control the University by 
ourselves. We know it and they know it. 
On the other hand if the clerical and 
technical and the service and mainten-
ance people all stood together, that's 
another ball game." 

Local 35 went to bat in November 
1980 with an organizational drive 
aimed at unionizing the C&Ts (clerical 
and technical workers). Similar efforts 
had failed in 1971 and 1977. According 
to Sirabella, the parent organization of 
Local 35 began to pour in what has now 
reached nearly a million dollars to 
organize the C&Ts once and for all. 
They called an election in early 1983, 
and on May 18 of that year the union 
was approved by a vote of 1267 to 1228. 
The victory came despite an inten-
sive three-year effort by the University 
to dissuade C&Ts from joining Local 34. 
Wages were increased by over 30 per-
cent and the administration hired the 
Hartford-based law firm of Seigal, 
O'Connor and Kanin, known to labor 
leaders as notorious "union-busters." 

The creation of Local 34 depended in 
large part on the earlier demonstrable 
success of Local 35. Its members, 
among the highest-paid service and 
maintenance workers in the country, 
served as an inspiration to the less well-
paid C&Ts. Many of the latter saw 
these gains first hand through their 
relatives in Local 35. "The C&Ts finally 
realized they had to have a union," 
Sirabella said. "Even $50 million and 50 
John Wilhelms couldn't have done for 
the organization of 34 what 35's 
achievements did." 

The financial successes of Local 35 
were essential in overcoming white col-
lar worker's negative perceptions of 
unions in general and of Local 35 in 
particular. In 1982 Jerald Stevens, then 
University vice-president for finance 
and administration, noted, "If you look 
at the history of relationships between 
the University and Local 35, I think 
that very few clerical and technical 
employees would like to experience 
that." 

"A lot of things happened—especially 
physical damage—that in retrospect I 
wish hadn't," said Sirabella of the Local 
35 strikes. "The white-collar workers 
didn't want any part of that." Relations 
were strained on the other side as well. 
When the members of Local 35 struck 
three times in the late 1970s, the 
C&Ts—still non-union—remained at 
work and often filled in for the striking 
workers. 

Strained relations have failed to play 
a role in the latest strike. "The majority 
of both unions are working class," said 
Wilhelm. "The distinction between blue 
and white collar is fake and largely due 
to employment stereotypes. The 
economy has shifted to a service base 
and workers have gone where the jobs 
are. Differences in types of jobs don't 
mean the workers are so different." 

"There's a very strong affinity 
developing between the two unions," 
Sirabella concurred. "The members of 
Local 35 are sophisticated enough to 
know that if Local 34 goes down they're 
going to keep having strikes and lousy 
settlements. They see their support as a 
short-term investment in long-term 
benefits for both unions." 

Aside from its relationship with Local 
35, the C&Ts face internal difficulties. 
The Local 34 bargaining unit includes 
typists and computer operators, athletic 
trainers and lab technicians, spread 
throughout almost every department at 
Yale. This diversity has clearly been a 
factor in the union's inability to gain the 
unqualified support and membership of 
more than 1700 of the total 2600 
workers in the C&T bargaining unit. 

The union charges that the University 
believes this diversity will eventually 
split Local 34 and end the strike. "I 
don't know why the University operates 
on the theory that they won't support 
each other," said Wilhelm. "That's one 
of their two biggest miscalculations." 

There had been a similar disunity 
within Local 35 that the 1971 strike 
overcame. "There were a lot of highly 
skilled maintenance tradesmen who 
thought they had nothing in common 
with the housekeeping and dining hall 
people," Sirabella said. "To make the 
strike effective we had to overcome 

While members of Local 34 marched on 
the picket line, George Conte began to 
prepare for negotiations with Yale on 
Local 35's contract, which expires 
January 17, 1985. Conte, who is 
worker president of that union, is 
organizing department meetings to 
determine workers' needs and concerns. 
In the University's Department of 
Employee Relations, Donald Stevens 
prepares for those same negotiations 
which should begin sometime next 
month. "We're doing wage and benefit 
surveys right now to examine the posi-
tion of the bargaining unit with relation 
to the market," Stevens said. 

With or without the strike, these 
promise to be difficult negotiations. The 
1982 settlement gave the union a very 
small salary increase but promised some 
major changes in working conditions. 
The University points to this settlement 
as a turning point in its labor relations. 
"We'd hoped progress was being 
made," said Wilhelm, "especially on job 
security and benefits. They threw those 
promises to the wind after they signed 
in '82. These very serious broken prom-
ises will be the focus of Local 35's 
negotiations." The union fears the 
University will eventually hire outside 
contractors 
its grounds and 
buildings maintenance, as Harvard has 
already begun to do. This would further 
cut the membership of a Local that has 
seen 
its 
numbers cut 
drastically 
through attrition over the past 15 
years. The union hopes to remove the 
no-strike clause from its contract, alter 
other language and gain wage and 
benefit improvements. 

"The University has to decide it will 
do what most employers do: avoid 
strikes," Wilhelm said. "It has not done 
anything that normal people would call 
negotiating in any of these strikes. It has 
to do something other than try to dictate 
settlements." 

Donald Stevens disagreed. "The 
University has been very open. We're 
trying to be responsive to what the 
employees perceive as their needs. 
We're not in any way attacking or belit-
tling the union," he said. "John Wilhelm 
is a very effective labor leader and I've 
always felt he was very realistic. He says 
the University has to reorder its 
priorities. I disagree with him. But the
