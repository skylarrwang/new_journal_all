dividual. The power rapist seeks to 
reinforce his authority and adequacy as 
a man by intimidating or forcing his 
victim into sexual submission. Such an 
attacker's victims are usually his age or 
younger, and he uses only enough force 
to make his victim cooperate. 

When a man rapes, however, society 
rarely sees beyond the violation to the 
attacker's struggles with his own ag-
gressive tendencies. 
Rather, Groth 
asserted that rape often occurs because 
of a man's loss of self control. "Some 
men rape and don't understand why. 
They constantly wrestle with their own 
violent impulses," said Groth. "Others 
don't question what they do but feel 
compelled to do it." 

Groth noted that the college environ-
ment, with all its pressures, may often 
lead to instances of power rape. "It is a 
device which compensates for some 
threat to the offender's sense of worth or 
manhood," he explained. "Men rape 
when they are under great stress or 
when they lack the resources to handle 
the daily stresses. At Yale those strains 
probably stem from academic perfor-
mance and social achievement." 

Slowly, members of the University 
are becoming aware of such men and 
their offenses. The occasional victim 
who wishes to talk about her rape turns 
to a friend, a trusted faculty member, a 
clergyman or an administrator, such as 
her college master. "Violent acts of sex-
ual harassment do occur on the Yale 
campus with greater frequency than 
most of us are willing to admit," said 
one master, who wished to remain 
anonymous. "I wouldn't for a moment 
suggest that a large percentage of 
students are involved, but the smallest 
percentage is too large." 

Last fall, two women approached 
him separately, each telling him that 
she had been assaulted by a man at 
Yale. 

Even before discussing 
disciplinary action, the master urged 
the women to get counseling. "In both 
cues the first thtrig I tried to do was to 
make sure they got personal help to 
restore at least a modicum of self-
esteem," he explained. "Mter there was 
a semblance of control, I told them 
"Men rape when 
they lack the 
resources to handle 
the daily stresses. 
At Yale those 
strains probably 
stem from academic 
performance and 
social achievement." 
about any recourse. One woman was a 
senior, and the incident happened in 
her junior year. It took her a long time 
to step forward finally and make any 
allegations." 

Both women eventually took their 
cases to the Executive Committee, 
although the master would not reveal 
the outcome of the complaints. One of 
many grievance institutions at Yale, the 
Executive Committee addresses any in-
fraction of the Handbook of UndergradUQ.te 
R~gul.aJions, including sexual harassment 
and coercion committed by students. 

The Provost's procedure must be used 
for all "cross unit" complaints: an 
undergraduate who has been attacked 
by a graduate student, or a graduate stu-
dent molested by a student from another 
graduate school. Yale College and most 
of the graduate and professional schools 
also have their own sexual harassment 
grievance boards designed to handle 
complaints against 
University em-
ployees. 

The undergraduate sexual harass-
ment grievance board, an advisory 
board which cannot take punitive ac-
tion, grew out of the 1977 class action 
suit Alextuullr v. Yale. One of the five 
complainants was an undergraduate 
who alleged that she had been raped by 
a Yale music instructor. The plaintiffs 
believe that the University ignored their 
demands for a grievance system, and 
thereby forced them to sue. Although 
the students lost their case in court, the
