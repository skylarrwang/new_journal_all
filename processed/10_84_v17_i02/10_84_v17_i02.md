Yale or Death
"My life is ruined," screams a young
man grasping a rejection notice in his
hand. "I'll become agarbage man and
I'll live on 130th Street with 12 under-
nourished children and a domineering,
obese housewife with a big hairy pimple
over her upper lip. I'll die of banality!"
Sound bleak to you? Well, it seems that
way to the main character in Give Me
Yale or Give Me Death, a play wri'tten,
produced and directed by a high school
student from New York City.

Seventeen-year-old Alec Klein knew
little about Yale when he wrote his play.
As a senior at Stuyvesant High School
in Manhattan, he is only one of many
students
worried
about
life
after
graduation. But he wrote a play about
it, raised the necessary $1500 and pro-
duced Give Me Yale or Give Me Death,
which ran at the off-Broadway
Westbeth Theatre this August for seven
performances, five of which were sold
out.

As the title indicates, the main
character dreams of attending Yale.
"Yale is like the California Gold Rush-
everyone wants to go there. It's looked
on as a very desirable college to attend.
Yale is more symbolic than anything
else," Klein said.

His protagonist, 17-year-old Eugene,
wants to go to Yale and become a
playwright just as his deceased father
had. The play traces how Eugene copes
with his rejection from the University.
On top of this rejection, he must also
learn to face his mother, whom he has
not seen since his father's death.

According to Klein, Eugene's emo-
tions and attitudes are largely autobio-
graphical. "In one form or another all of
the characters in the play have been
part of my life," he said. He had actual-
ly been separated from his own mother
for many years. However, his father,
who never attended Yale, is very much
alive.

Klein, like Eugene, is seriously pur-
suing a career as a playwright. In addi-
tion to Give Me Yale or Give Me Death,
which he wrote in April1984, Klein has
written two musicals, one of which was
6 The New Journal/October 19, 1984
produced at his high school this year.

Klein is now just beginning to ex-
plore various colleges.
Is he as
obsessed with Yale as Eugene is? "Yale
does hold potential, but it's not a
definite," he said. "I won't know
whether to apply until I make a visit.
One thing is for sure, though: if I'm re-
jected, my life will be far from ruined."


**Title: On the Record**
**Author:  (No author explicitly stated)**

Alec Klein
On the Record
"I have a vivid memory of the first
rehearsal,"
recalls Aaron Copland,
referring to his organ symphony of
1924, "because, of all times, I was late
due to an unexplained delay on the sub-
way ... I was in such a hurry to get in-
to that hall that instead of going around
the block to the stage entrance, I
yanked open the front door of the main
hall. Suddenly, I got a blast of my own
orchestration! . . . I was absolutely
overwhelmed to hear it for the very ftrst
time. It sounded so glorious to me, so
much grander than I could possibly
have imagined." Composers have
always been able to speak to future
generations through their mustc, but
now their voices and personal reflec-
tions on their lives can also be pre-
served. Through the efforts of Vivian
Perlis, director of the Oral History,
American Music Project at the Yale
School of Music, famous composers
such as Copland, Leo Orstein and
Eubie Blake can be heard on tapes in
the Project's archives. According to
Perlis, "Sound provides a closer touch
with the personality of the composer
-'you have the immediacy, the spon-
taneity."

Perlis has recently received acclaim
from book reviewers for her role as co-
author of Aaron
Copland's long-
awaited autobiography, Copland: 1900
Through 1942. The book is based largely
on transcripts of Perlis' taped interviews
with Copland, who is 84. In praising
the book, John Rockwell of the New
York Times said, "The story of its
assemblage is fascinating in itself."

Perlis describes the Oral~istory,
American Music Project as "the first
endeavor to collect and preserve oral ac-
counts of personalities and events of our
musical past [and] the only full-time,
continuing research project of its kind."
It began with Perlis' work in 1968 on
Charles lves '98 who left his collection of
manuscripts and. papers to the Yale
Music Library,
where
Perlis was
reference librarian at the time. She
began to collect more information about
Ives in the form of taped interviews
with people who had known him, find-
ing that this method uncovered many
facts and anecdotes about the com-
poser. This information formed the
basis for Perlis' book
Charles lues
Remembered: An Oral History, which won
two awards and subsequently helped
establish oral history as a respected
technique in music history. Perlis' ex-
tensive work in the field since then has
included co-production of an Ives
record package and production of a
television documentary on Eubie Blake.

Copl<md was one of the first com-
posers Perlis felt was important to work
with: "Anyone involved in American
music is aware of him." Oral history
was a particularly good technique for

working with Copland, a man whom 
Rockwell described as "reticent about 
himself." Perlis said, "Sometimes it 
takes the catalyst of another person to 
make a composer remember ... The 
interviewer can ask questions that trig· 
ger a memory and bring forgotten in-
formation to the surface." 


Along with her Oral History work, 
Perlis, a fellow of Morse College, 
directs a workshop called "Musical 
Dialogues," which will take place in 
Morse on six Monday afternoons dur· 
ing the year, giving students a chance to 
meet performers in the New Haven 
Symphony. In all her work, Perl is 
shows great concern for learning. As 
she said about her Copland research, 
"You want to get below the surface ... 
The learning process is marvelous."

**Rewriting the Right**
**Author: Dan Levy**

The Yale Free Press is dead. After two 
ltormy years of existence, the right· 
wing newspaper, 
which facetiously 
eulogized Yuri Andropov as the "man 
who courageously stood up for the 
tecurity of international borders by 
shooting down KAL flight 007," has 
ceased publication. Ready to fill the 
media void is john Zmirak, BR '86, the 
controversial and outspoken former ex· 
ecutive editor of the Free Press. Zmirak 
and fellow junior Luis Ortiz plan to 
launch a new paper called the Yale 
Vcmpard, intended, like the Free Press, as 
an outlet for conservative voices on 
campus. According to Zmirak, the Van-
''""d will "change the 
liberal 
monologue to pluralistic dialogue." 


Zmirak and Ortiz, however, plan to 
avoid attracting the negative publicity 
for which the Free Press was infamous. 
'7be Free Press was a little extreme," Or· 
tiz said. "It attracted a lot of attention 
but people didn't read it seriously." 
Zlniralt agreed, "The Free Press made 
bold assertions but failed to defend 
=:::.We want a journal of politics and 
Zrnirak further contended that the 
F,. Prus "wasn't intellectually honest. • 
Indeed, 
in one instance, Chris 
John Zmirak 
Gram '86 charged that an article he 
submitted to the Fr~~ Pr~ss last spring 
was significantly altered without his 
permission and then published under 
his byline. According to Gram, a story 
originally intended to be a "non-
partisan, non-judgmental humor piece" 
on Democratic politicians was turned 
into a 
ridiculing attack 
on 
the 
Democratic Party and its ideals. "What 
got me upset," said Gram, "was that 
something that wasn't mine had my 
name on it." 


But alleged breaches of journalistic 
ethics apparently did not cause the 
demise of the Fr~~ Press. The staff of the 
paper, contended Zmirak, was very 
cliquish, and when most of the clique 
graduated last semester, there was no 
one left to print the paper. Patricia 
Webster, ex-Free Press publisher, would 
not comment on Zmirak's remarks, but 
an official from the organization that 
originally funded the Fr~~ Press thought 
there were other problems. Jonathan 
Cohen of the Institute for Educational 
Affairs, a neo-conservative group that 
also gave funds to the DarlmouJla Rroiau 
and the Harvard Sc.limt, said, "There was 
no sense of direction or purpose. It 
wasn't clear what they wanted to be- an 
essay journal, a tabloid, a focus on 
satire and parody or on campus events." 


Cohen also faulted the paper for prob-
lems of organization and succession. 
Nevertheless, Zmirak and Ortiz plan to 
apply to the Institute for grants to help 
publish the Vanguard. 


For Zmirak, Ortiz and their new 
paper, the next step is a heavy recruit· 
ment of the freshman class. "We think 
there's a lot of hidden con!lervatism out 
there," Zmirak said. If all goes well, he 
added, the first issue of the Vanguard will 
appear on October 25-"to celebrate 
the first anniversary of the liberation of 
Grenada."

**Soldier as Statesman**
**Author: Sam Os~**

Although in 1971 he led a group of pro· 
testing veterans who threw their Viet-
nam War medals on the Capitol's steps, 
Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor 
John Kerry '66 (TNJ, March, 1984) is 
now closer to his goal of working within 
that same building. After a solid victory 
in the September 18th Massachusetts 
Democratic senatorial primary, Kerry 
faces millionaire industrialist Raymond 
Shamie in the November election. 


Kerry's progressive liberalism contrasts 
sharply with Shamie's staunch conser-
vatism, offering Massachusetts voters 
two distinct alternatives. 


After leaving Yale Kerry fought in 
Vietnam, and upon his return he 
founded the Vietnam Veterans Against 
the War, a group which marched on 
Washington, DC, in 1971. This ac· 
tivism remains in his current politics. 
Kerry firmly opposes American in-
tervention in Central America, sup· 
ports a nuclear freeze and believes that 
cuts in defense spending can eliminate 
most of the federal deficit. To prove his 
words, Kerry produced a 40-page list of 
defense cuts totaling over $50 billion. 


He would support a tax increase to 
lessen the deficit only "as a last resort," 
said Alexis DeSeife, one of Kerry's 
press secretaries. 


The winner of the contest will take 
the seat of Senator PauJ Tsongas, who 
is retiring due to illness. The &ston 
GIDbe states that Kerry leads in the latest 
polls- not too difficult in Massachu· 
setts, which has four times as many 
registered Democrats as Republicans. 


Crucial for victory, however, are votes 
from the state's large Independent Par-
ty. According to DeSeife, Kerry's in-
dividualism should help him capture 
that vote. "Kerry never had a label, 
doesn't want a label and is his own 
man: she said.

**The Morrison-DeNardis Race**
**Author: Rich Blow**
**Page number(s): 8, 9**

In 1980, a time of GOP electoral vic-
tories nationwide, Republican Larry 
DeNardis was elected Congressman 
from Connecticut's Third District, a 
traditional Democratic stronghold. In 
1982 DeNardis was heavily favored to 
win re-election over Democrat Bruce 
Morrison, a former lawyer for the New 
Haven Legal Assistance Association 
and a 1973 graduate of Yale Law 
School. Even Morrison's own polls 
showed the challenger losing by. 30 
percentage points just six weeks before 
the election. But when the votes were in 
on Election Day, Morrison had beaten 
DeNardis by a scant 1500 votes, about 
one percent of the turnout. DeNardis 
had won all but three of the district's 16 
towns, yet a sizable loss to Morrison 
in New Haven cost him the election. 


Two years 
later, 
with 
Ronald 
Reagan back on the ballot, it is DeNar-
dis' turn to challenge Morrison. The 
election has attracted nationwide atten-
tion from political activists intent on 
maintaining or eradicating the 
Democrats' majority in Congress. The 
Village Voice, for instance, champion-
ed Morrison as one of 18 Congressional 
"Reaganbusters," while Freeze '84, the 
political action arm of the nuclear freeze 
movement, termed Morrison's race one 
of the 22 most critical elections in the 
country. For his part, DeNardis has 
won the support of prominent Repub-
licans 
like Gerald Ford and en-
dorsements from conservative groups 
like the United States Chamber of 
Commerce and the American Medical 
Association. 


Yet this 
race's importance goes 
beyond the realm of politics and the 
media. The two candidates differ fun-
damentally on the major issues of this 
campaign: where federal money will be 
spent in the next four years, especially 
in light of the current deficit, and how 
the United States will conduct itself 
towards its allies and opponents. 


The answers to these questions have 
concrete ramifications for the Third 
Congressional District. Cutting federal 
spending could mean cutting benefit 
programs 
for the unemployed in 
downtown New Haven. Raising taxes 
could mean impairing the growth of 
local businesses and the financial securi-
ty of individual 
cttJzens. 
Defense 
budget decisions can affect Americans 
in Nicaragua as well as blue-collar 
workers at weapons factories in Con-
necticut. 


The New journal chose these issues 
from among various others at stake in 
this election because of their particular 
importance to New Haven . 


The Candidates Speak 
Democratic Voice 
Rich Blow 
TNJ: In 1982 you won a very close 
election over a popular incumbent. 
How and why do you think you won 
that election? 
BM: Most importantly, I persuaded a 
bare majority of the people that I had 
more to offer as a Congressman than 
Mr. DeN ardis. The reason I was able to 
persuade people was a combination of 
things: I had a very good organization. 
A lot of people talk about grass-roots 
campaigns, but this was one in reality; 
there were literally hundreds upon hun-
dreds of volunteers involved in my 
paign. 


We had extremely good polling. We 
knew how to reach people on things that 
they cared about and it matched very 
much things that I cared about. And we 
had very, very powerful television 
advertising which, for a very limited 
amount of money, went a long way. 


The final thing to be said is that 
Larry DeN ardis thought he couldn't 
lose and ran a terrible campaign. 


TNJ: So that was his big mistake in that 
race, being overconfident? 
BM: Well, 
big mistake number 
one- the one that he could have done 
something about- is that he was over-
confident. 


The things he couldn't do anything 
about are that he really doesn't under-
stand things all that well and makes 
statements like "The neutron bomb isn't 
a nuclear weapon." That's a problem 
that goes deeper than things you can do 
something about. I mean, that's such a 
stupid statement. rm not sure he could 
have fixed that, but he could have fixed 
the fact that he was overconfident and 
that he treated me with disdain rather 
than respect as an opponent. 


TNJ: Do you have hard feelings about 
that? 
"fm not campaigning against a recovery. 
rm campaigning against budget deficits 
that are going to wreck any recovery." 
8 The New journal/October 19, 1984 
BM: No, that's one of the reasons I 
won. I benefited from that. It wasn't 
credible to me. At no time during my 
campaign, despite the fact that I came 
from relative obscurity, did I really suf-
fer from a credibility gap. People did 
not ever say, "Wl\o the hell does he 
think he is, running for Congress?" 


They saw that I knew what I was talk-
ing about, that I had command of the 
issues, that I had the skills necessary to 
function 
competitively 
with Larry 
DeN ardis. 


I don't have any hard feelings. I don't 
have any hard feelings at all. I won. 


TNJ: What do you think the differences 
will be between this race and that one, 
aside from the obvious difference that 
you're the incumbent now? 
BM: fd say that over the two years be-
tween this race and the l~t race I have 
gained a tremendous amount in terms 
of breadth of support. Last time bus-
iness was uniformly for Larry DeNar-
dis. This time the business community 
is divided . . . some of them are for 
DeN ardis, some of them are for me.

increased defense spending. Well, that 
was done, and now, according to an in-
dependent study, [military] readiness is 
lower today than it was when Reagan 
came into office. 

Number three, deregulation. I ask 
people to look around at their phone 
bills, their natural gas bills, their light 
bills, and wonder how they're feeling 
about deregulation. 

The fourth thing is tight money. 
We've had relatively tight money and 
we know what we got. We got high un-
employment and high interest rates. 
Now we 
are 
having a 
robust 
economy; why are we having a robust 
economy? 

TNJ: I was just going to ask you that. 

BM: Because we have $200 billion 
dollar budget deficits. This is the 
greatest Keynesian recovery in the 
history of the United States. We are 
pumping up the economy with $200 
billion dollars of money creation every 
year. It's well known that this can be 
done. 

Now those aren't political answers. 
Those are facts. That's the economic 
analysis of what's going on right now. 
And it's dangerous, and everybody 
knows those deficits are dangerous. 

TNJ: But don't you find yourself in an 
awkward political position where you 
seem to be campaigning against a 
recovery? 

BM: rm not campaigning against a 
recovery. 
Pm campaigning against 
budget deficits that are going to wreck 
any recovery. 

TNJ: But you're going to have to con-
vince people that these deficits really are 
a threat. 

BM: If people are going to make their 
decision on the narrow question of 
whether Reaganomics helped them 
during this particular four year period 
more than it hurt them, that's a ques-
tion. I don't think people are going to 
look at it that way. I think what people 
are going to look at is, "Where are we 
going in the future?" 

TNJ: Voters tend to vote their pocket-
books, though, and their pocketbooks 
are probably more full now than they 
were in 1980. 

BM: Their pocketbooks are a mixed 
bag. If they're below the median in-
come, their pocketbooks are not better, 
they're worse. If they are way above the 
median income and they're rich, they 
are better ofT, but the stability of the 
economy is probably more important to 
them than the particular dollars they get, 
because they've got plenty of money. 
And the people who are the upper 
middle class, the people above the me-
dian but aren't rich, they've gotten 
some benefits and they've gotten some 
burdens. They can't get student loans 
any more for their kids, they're seeing a 
lot of problems in terms of household 
expenses, they see the environment in 
trouble, and they see foreign policy as a 
concern as well. I don't think that 
they're thinking the world is all rosy. 

TNJ: Ronald Reagan is expected to do 
very well in Connecticut, and that surge 
of Republican votes will probably help 
Larry DeNardis. What is the effect of 
DeNardis' seemingly close association 
with many of Reagan's policies? 

BM: If someone lacks competitive 
ability on his own, he looks 
to 
somebody else to win the election. I 
think that's the case here. 
Ronald Reagan is personally popular 
. . people do not agree with a lot of 
what he has done, but they give him 
benefit of the doubt because they like 
him. 

Pm not running against Ronald 
Reagan and I don't intend to be drawn 
into a race against Reagan. If someone 
wanted to run me for President, then fd 
argue about whether Ronald Reagan 
should be President. . 

I 
support the Mondale-Ferraro 
ticket. Irrespective of what people think 
aqout that, I lr.now I will do a better job 
of representing the Third Congressional 
district than Larry DeNardis. I intend 
to run a race in which people go to the 
polls on Election Day clearly knowing 
about the Congressional race as a 
separate matter. And I think that will 
fortify me against the possibility of a big 
Reagan sweep in the district. 

TNJ: Does the fact that Walter Moo-
dale never even came to Connecticut 
during the primary season hurt your 
campaign? 

BM: No, I don't think it means much 
at all. I did not endorse anybody at that 
time and I chose to maintain neutrality. 
[During the primaries] I did not feel the 
critical issue was whom we would 
nominate. The critical issue was, what 
are the issues upon which people will 
make their decisi.Qns in November? fve 
been saying this since last year and it 
wasn't useful to say Hart vs. Mondale 
vs. Jackson. I think I did a lot more 
good by talking about the issues than by 
just jumping on a particular band-
wagon. 

TNJ: Then why diQ. you endorse 
Geraldine Ferraro for Vice-President? 

BM: I endorsed Ferraro after it was 
clear that Mondale was going to be our 
presidential nominee. It was a sensible 
thing to do and it brought together 
politics and 
good policy at that 
time- and that's always an ideal situa-
tion to make a move. 

TNJ: Did you endorse her on grounds 
of experience or because as a female, 
Italian, Northeastern urbanite she's 
bound to help your campaign? 

BM: My view was that of all the choices 
Fritz Mondale could make for Vice-
President, the one that would do the 
best job of electing him was Geraldine 
Ferraro. 

That's what this is about. This is 
about getting elected. This isn't an in-
tellectual exercise. We pick people on a 
political basis to get elected and the 
grounds are, will they be capable of do-
ing a good job? And Gerry in my view 
is well qualified to be Vice-President of 
the United States and President of the 
United States. 

TNJ: One area in which you've come 
out strongly against the President is 
foreign policy. For instance, you spoke 
out adamantly against the invasion of 
Grenada. Given that elections there are 
scheduled for this fall, do you still op-
pose the invasion? 

BM: The invasion of Grenada is a 
classic case of "Do the ends justify the 
means?" Assuming-without knowing 
-that the people of Grenada are better 
off today than they would have been 
had we not invaded, that's true in 
many parts of the world, that with some 
luck the use of military power might 
replace a bad government with a good 
one. 

I don't happen to think that's consis-
tent either with international law or 
with our own traditions as best enun-
ci_ated to go around practicing gunboat 
diplomacy, invading countries we don't 
agree with and replacing their govern-
ments. 

Grenada was a little fly-speck of a 
COUntry-and we got away with it. Peo-
ple died, and people got hurt, and our 
reputation around the world was dealt a 
serious blow. But we got away with it. 

TNJ: Why did you vote against the 
most recent aid appropriations bill to El 
Salvador? 

~M: There was absolutely no restric-
tion on the use of the money. We are 
pumping more and more military aid 
ID!O a country that has a record of 
~ISUsing aid to oppress its own popula-
tion. Duarte may pull it off, but he will 
pull if off to our satisfaction if he respects 
human rights and implements land 
refor:m and starts negotiating with the 
guerillas. That's the kind of conditions 
that should be on our money; otherwise 
we're just throwing gasoline on a fire. 

TNJ: Do you think the President is 
serious about arms control? 

BM: No, he hasn't done what is 
necessary if he were serious. Yes, the 
Russians have walked away from arms 
talks but after they were basically given 
an ultimatum by the United States 
about what we would talk about and 
what we wouldn't talk about. We used 
bad negotiating skills. It does us little 
good to say, "Oh well, they walked 
away from the table, that's their pro-
blem. Screw them." That's ridiculous. 
Reagan is a total failure at negotiating 
with the Soviets. 

TNJ: For the Democrats, what are the 
crucial issues in this election? 

BM: If people look to the question of 
which candidate and which party has a 
clue as to doing something positive 
about our needs for the future, the 
Democratic ticket wins. The issues for 
the future are what are we going to do 
about the federal budget and who's go-
ing to talk turkey about the deficit? 
Who's going to talk turkey about the 
loss of industrial jobs in the United 
States? 

We're going to talk about foreign 
policy and whether or not we're going to 
build a foreign policy based on human 
rights and economic opportunity, or 
whether we're going to try to be the 
world's policeman. 

And we're going to talk about the 
arms race and whether we want to build 
a new round of first strike weapons and 
engage in "Star Wars" developments as 
our "answer" to preventing nuclear war. 

Irrespective of what you think about 
1976-1980, irrespective of what you 
think about 1980-1984, those are the 
choices for the future. 

TNJ: If re-elected, will you run for 
higher office? 

BM: fve got one goal and that's to be 
re-elected to Congress. And just like 
there was a time for me to run for Con-
gress, if there's a time for me to run for 
something else, I'll do it then. fve got 
no master plan.

TNJ: In 1982, you lost an election to 
Bruce Morrison. Now, two years later, 
do you feel that your positions have 
changed enough to give you a chance of 
defeating him? 

LD: In 1982, I supported policies which 
were challenged by Bruce Morrison. 
He said the economy was a disaster and 
going to get worse, and the reverse was 
true. his views haven't changed, and 
neither have mine. The economy has 
changed, dramatically. I believe that 
my support for the main lines of the 
President's economic recovery progtam 
restraining federal spending and the 
reduction of the regulatory burden on 
businesses and individuals have en-
couraged an economic growth which is 
the marvel of the world. I think we can 
continue that economic growth into the 
eighties if we continue to pursue policies 
with a freer market approach. So in the 
campaign of 1984, I am campaigning 
on my support, my very active support, 
of a program that worked. 

TNJ: In your first and second cam-
paigns you were perceived, correctly or 
not, as a more moderate Republican 
candidate. Do you think that your posi-
tion in the party has changed? 

LD: I'm still a moderate Republican 
who supports fiscal conservatism, but 
who, on a whole range of environmen-
tal, social, civil rights and women's 
issues, can quite comfortably be regard-
ed as a moderate, if not a liberal can-
didate. 

TNJ: How closely are your policies 
aligned to Ronald Reagan's? 

LD : I don't think that's a relevant ques-
tion 
support the Reagan 
economic policy, but I have a record as 
a five-term state senator preceding 
Reagan's presidency, and I stand on 
that legacy. I will continue to believe 
and act on those impulses regardless of 
who is president. 

TNJ: Who is your constituency now? 

LD: Well, in 1980, of the 16 towns in 
the Third Congressional District, 14 
towns voted for me; I lost only New 
Haven and West Haven. In 1982 I car-
ried 13 towns, losing New Haven, West 
Haven and add to that East Haven. I 
think that my constituency is virtually 
every town around except New Haven, 
and I expect to carry all 15. I will lose 
New Haven, but I hope to keep that loss 
at a respectable margin. 

TNJ: Why will you lose New Haven? 

LD : Because New Haven is over-
whelmingly Democratic. There's vir-
tually no Republican Party. Those 
members who are left struggle valiantly, 
but haven't won any significant local or 
state office in two decades. 

TNJ: 
You mention the economic 
recovery. Bruce Morrison claims that 
the current economic recovery is a 
fluke, generated by the huge deficit. 
What do you think of this claim? 

LD: I think it's patently ridiculous. 
Bruce Morrison has been consistently 
wrong on economic issues. His under-
standing of economics is pitiful. He has 
not yet been able to demonstrate that 
one thing he has predicted has come to 
pass. I am very confident that we are in 
a new economic era, in which we are 
encouraging investment, savings and 
economic growth. It is clear that in the 
first half of 1984 the economy grew by 
an impressive 7. 7 percent. We haven't 
had figures like that in years. 

TNJ: What do you propose to do about 
the deficit which many believe helped 
cause the recession in the first place? 

LD: Well, I propose to tackle the 
spending side of the federal budget. My 
own view is that the deficit today is a 
product of spending over the last 22 
years at a rate far in excess of revenues. 
.During that same period we have con-
tinued to build new spending programs, 
new agencies and new demands into the 
"Bruce Morrison has been consistently 
wrong on economic issues. H is under-
standing of economics is pitiful." 
budget; meanwhile, Congress has not 
been willing to increase taxes. But our 
tax level at this point is about as high as 
I would like to see us go, because taxes 
are simply money withdrawn from the 
private sector, and when we take out 
this money we impair ou r opportunity 
to form capital and regenerate and ex-
pand our economy. So I think it is ter-
ribly important that we keep taxation at 
its present level and try to trim spend-
ing. 

TNJ: What exactly would you cut? 

LD: I think at this point that the entire 
federal budget across the board, domes-
tic and defense spending, needs to be 
restrained. And again I'm talking not so 
much about cutting as keeping the rate 
of growth at a lo~er percentage increase 
than has been the habit of the last two 
decades. Where we have increased 
spending at the rate of 10 ~ percent per 
annum, we should cut increases to 5 
percent or less across the bo~. 

One of the ways we could do that is to 
take seriously the Grace Commission 
Report, which made nearly 2500 rec-
ommendations about how we could 
save money by improving manage-
ment, by streamlining the federal 
bureaucracy and by improving the 
operations of tlte federal government. 
The Grace Commission recommended 
that over $400 billion. could be saved. 
Now I realize that m;ny of these pro-
posals may be politically impractical, 
and consequently I think that only a 
portion of this $400 billion can be 
saved. What is needed to bring the 
deficit under control is nothing more 
than the political will to restrain the 
relentless pressure from interest groups 
for increased government services. 

Another step might be to give the 
president the line-item veto, the capaci-
ty to veto particular items in the budget, 
a power incidentally which 43 ou t of 50 
governors have, although it was denied 
the president. I also think that the presi-
dent should have limited impoundment 
power restored to him. These things 
taken together can substantially hdp 
our ability to control runaway budgets 
and put us on the right track.

TNJ: How would the Grace Commis-
sion cuts, many of which deal with 
federal pensions and federal employees, 
affect your constituents in New Haven? 
LD: The problem is larger than any 
one subset of society. If we are constant-
ly going to look at one interest group or 
another, we will do nothing, we will be 
paralyzed. The problem must be ex-
amined in a forthright fashion. If it is 
necessary to implement practices which 
will keep this country from creating 
such enormous deficits that it will 
weaken the currency, weaken our posi-
tion in the world economy, weaken our 
position as a leader of the Western 
World, then I think that everybody may 
have 
to 
sacrifice, 
and 
I 
stress 
everybody. 

TNJ: If you were the president, and 
you were given the line-item veto, what 
kind of programs would you cut? 
LD: Well, I'm not going to project the 
next fiSCal year, but there were items 
like the Clinch River Breeder Reactor, 
which employs a technology that is an 
interim technology, and is 
almost 
superseded at this point. But because of 
powerful positions of both Republicans 
and Democrats in Congress from Ten-
nessee, the Clinch River Reactor went 
forward, and we spent billions of 
dollars. 

TNJ: You've mentioned special interest 
groups several times. Haven't you taken 
money from political action committees 
as well? 
LD: I take money from political action 
groups, that's not the issue. The issue is 
whether political action committees 
representing special interest groups 
dominate one's campaign receipts to the 
~ent that one will be seriously limited 
Ill one's ability to be totally free and in-
dependent as a representative. The dif-
Strence between Bruce Morrison and 
IDe on that issue and many others is that 
I am willing to put my money where my 
IDouth is. I've called for him to restrict 
bia campaign finances as I intend to. He 
baa of course refused to do so, but I am 
IOing to go ahead anyway. I believe 
that candidates should receive 50 per-
cent of their money from individuals, 
and primarily donations 
in small 
denominations, from people who are 
located in one's district. I think that's an 
enormously important principle, one 
that goes to the heart of representative 
government. 

TNJ: What about the argument that in 
certain cases, the power of special in-
terest groups, such as women's groups 
and minority groups, represent the first 
time such groups have had a voice in 
government? 
LD: What makes you immediately 
assume that the target of my concern is 
women's groups and minority groups? 

TNJ: I don't necessarily: those are ex-
amples. 
LD: I think it's wonderful that they are 
involved. I think it's wonderful that they 
support candidates. I have no argument 
with any of that. I'm talking about the 
net effect of getting two thirds or more 
of one's campaign contributions from 
organized special interest groups, those 
that wear black hats and those that wear 
white hats. They all have demands, and 
the understanding is that if you accept 
their contributions you are going to be 
indebted to that organization and its 
political agenda. When you add up the 
commitments, explicit and implicit, 
there isn't very much room for exercis-
ing your independence. 

TNJ: In 1981, you voted for the 
Reagan omnibus budget bill, which 
received a great deal of criticism from 
the press because it cut things like food 
stamps, 
student loans, and Social 
Security. In retrospect, would you vote 
for that bill again? 
LD: First of all, your information is 
wrong; it slowed the growth of the in-
creases in each one of those areas. ln no 
one of those areas that you cite did 
spending programs receive a 
net 
decrease; 
spending increases were 
restrained. In the case of student loans 
. . . what we did was to re-establish an 
income test, as the program was 
originally established. It was only in the 
seventies that loans became available to 
anyone regardless of income, and that 
was wrong. We try to focus our pro-
grams on those who need them, and 
that's precisely what we did in 1981. We 
don't have government services to 
benefit all regardless of their standing. 

TNJ: So would you vote for that same 
bill again? 
LD: Yes, I would. 

TNJ: Do you think that that budget bill 
hurt people in your district? 
LD: No, I do not. 

TNJ: I know that one important issu.e 
in the urban parts of your district is low-
cost housing, one area which has been 
adversely affected by budget cuts in the 
last few years. 
LD: Housing is an important issue; 
how we get it is another matter. We 
happen to be at a point in the debate on 
housing and public policy toward hous-
ing where the idea well has run dry. It 
doesn't really relate to Republicans or 
Democrats. There is a dearth of ideas 
about how to promote low-income 
housing. Many thoughtful people have 
come to the conclusion that 1930s-style 
public housing is a thing of the past and 
ought not to be duplicated again. I hap-
pen to feel that there is a role for the 
federal government in low-rent hous-
ing, I feel that strongly, but I want to do 
it· in the most cost-effective fashion. 

TNJ: Where does the defense budget 
rank on your list of spending priorities? 
LD: You may know that my opponent 
Bruce Morrison has consistently voted 
against all defense budget spending 
bills. This I believe to be a very ir-
responsible act. rm not in favor of 
spending large amounts of money on 
defense. I voted against the MX, the 
B-1 and a number of other weapons 
systems. I vote for amendments to cut 
the defense budget. But I voted in 1981 
and 1982 to appropriate money for 
defc:~se because I think it's important to 
our national security, and because I 
think it's important to the economy of 
Connecticut. If arms are going to be 
produced in this country, I want them 
to be produced in this state. 

TNJ: It has been noted that you voted 
in favor of researching the MX m issile, 
and against its production. Can you ex-
plain this reversal? 
LD: There has been no reversal. I have 
said right from the beginnin,g_ that I 
don't think we ought to prodbce the 
MX. But I came in to Congress follow-
ing seven years in which we spent a con-
siderable amount of research and 
development money on the MX. The 
only question I faced in 1981 was 
whether I should make an eighth and 
final commitment to the research and 
development of ·the MX missile. I 
thought that was the prudent thing to 
do, so that we would have on the draw-
ing boards the ability to produce such a 
missile if we ever needed it, so that we 
will be able to use it as a bargaining 
chip. I have never wavered in that opin-
ion. Once in 1982, after the election 
and before I was to leave office in 
December, Larry DeN ardis voted no to 
produce the MX. Larry DeNardis 
would still vote no, he regrets that the 
MX is being built and regrets th'at it is 
not being used as a bargaining chip in 
arms control talks. 

TNJ: What should the role of a Con-
gressman be in helping to end the arms 
race? 
LD: First of all, we've had a policy of 
deterrence, which over the last 35 years 
has at least prevented a world war, and 
certainly a nuclear war. It is said now 
that this policy will not be as useful in 
the future. I agree; I think we are enter-
ing into a new era where we will have to 
engage in arms control reduction. In 
the very first vote the House ever took 
on the freeze, I voted for the freeze. I 
also think that we should not wait 
around for the freeze to occur, because 
it may take a long time to get a freeze 
bill through Congress. It's important for 
the President and Congress to pursue 
many arm.s control options. We can 
deal specifically with command and 
control 
problems, 
we 
can 
deal 
specifically with ICBMs, we can deal 
specifically with pieces of the issue. 

TNJ: Had you been in Congress at the 
time, how would you have responded to 
the Grenada invasion? 
LD: First of all, instead of castigating 
the President within the first hour after 
receiving the news of the rescue opera-
tion, I would have waited and tried to 
get some information, rather than im-
mediately assuming that it was a hostile 
use of American troops, that the request 
for aid from a medical school was ab-
surd on its face value, that the long-
term effects on our relationships with 
other states in the Caribbean were likely 
to be disastrous. Morrison was wrong. 
The future has not been worse, in fact it 
has been made better. The Grenada in-
cident has sent a signal throughout the 
Caribbean that the United States cares 
for its democratic allies, particularly 
when 
they specifically request 
[assistance]. The amount of damage 
that was done was minimal, there was 
minimal loss of life, all of the Americans 
were rescued without harm and it cer-
tainly did send a message to the Soviet 
and Central American terrorist network 
that the United States would not 
COuntenance subversion and violence 
within this hemisphere .. 

TNJ: What should the United States' 
role be in Central America? 
LD: There are two factors at work on 
the crisis in Central America. One is 
the attack that is being orchestrated by 
Cuba and its patron the Soviet Union, 
and I firmly believe that democracy and 
political progress cannot be attained in 
that region until that security threat is 
gone. The second factor is certainly in-
ternal, that is to say there is a great ine-
quality of property, there is illiteracy, 
there is bad health, there is a weakening 
of the judicial system, there is certainly 
political instability and repression. I 
think the United States must aim at 
fostering decent democratic regimes 
through 
a 
policy of defense and 
development· of the region, including 
adequate military and economic aid. I 
would specifically reject a policy of 
retreat and defeat. 

TNJ: Would you ever send American 
troops to fight in Central America? 
LD: I can't foresee any situation where 
I would send American troops. 

TNJ: One last question. To you, what 
are the most important issues in this 
election? Why are you running for 
Congress? 
LD: The economy, Social Security, 
modernizing our defense forces. The 
economy, keeping it on the right track 
that it is on, dealjng with problems like 
the deficit, avoiding high inflation and 
high unemployment. Secondly, keeping 
Social Security and Medicare sound, 
hopefully by working with both political 
parties and both chambers of Congress. 
Thirdly, 
modernizing our defense 
forces. I think there is a problem; we 
really do need to modernize. I think 
there is a more general statement of 
foreign policy to be made: that we want 
to maintain our freedom in a peaceful 
international environment, in which the 
United States and its allies and friends 
are secure against military threats, and 
which will allow democratic govern-
ments to flourish in a world of increas-
ing prosperity.

each other once in a while. After some 
time, he staned coming to my room in 
the middle of the night, after he had 
been drinking. I would be asleep, and 
my roommates would let him in. He 
would get on top of me, waking me up. 
"He wanted to have sex, and I would 
tell him 'No' very forcefully. But he 
didn't care. He never hurt me, but he 
would hold me down and just keep go-
ing. He was so physically strong that 
sometimes it was easier to give in than 
to fight. I just remember feeling so ... 
powerless. 
"The third or fourth time he came up 
was the last. He got on top of me and 
started kissing me. I woke up and told 
him to go away; I told him 'No way.' I 
pushed him off the bed a few times, but 
he still kept getting back on. Finally, I 
told him I never wanted to sec him 
again. I managed to get away from him 
and went to the living room. He didn't 
try to stop me; he just left. 
"Though I knew he was forcing me, I 
didn't call it rape immediately. I as-
sumed things like this happened in col-
lege, until a friend of mine had a very 
violent reaction to the story." 

Unable at first to admit the true 
nature of the situation to herself. Sarah

willing to admit." 
never reported the incidents to any 
University officials. Believing that she 
somehow contributed to the rape, Sarah 
found it difficult even to tell her room-
mates about it. "I didn't want to em-
harass myself in front of them," she 
recalled. "They didn't know I was in-
volved in such a struggle. They thought 
everything was okay, since I wasn't yell-
ing or screaming. And I really didn't 
want them to think I was weak. In any 
case, I was afraid that they would think, 
'Well, you've been saying "Yes" all these 
other times, who are you to say "No" 
now?'" 

Two years later, Sarah has left the 
assaults in her past. While she carries 
few scars from the incidents, she is 
nevenheless wary of her old boyfriend, 
who is still an undergraduate at Yale. 
"Now, whenever I see him, I mumble 
'Hi.' If he ever comes up to talk to me, I 
just ... well, you know how it is when 
you 
hate someone," 
she said. "I 
remember I saw him once at a pany, 
talking to a friend of mine. I pulled her 
away from him and told her to be ony 
careful." 

Prior to her experience, Sarah, like 
many women here, considered sexual 
assault only as an external threat, posed 
by a stranger lurking on Wall Street. 
Members of the 
University com· 
\nunity-men who 
are friends or 
teachers-simply did not rape. Unfor-
tunately, intelligence and education do 
not prevent a man from acting on his 
violent impulses. Some men at Yale do 
rape, and their victims are often female 
students. Frequently, many of these 
women do not or cannot accept the fact 
that a man they trust has violated them. 
Therefore few victims ever report the 
offense, and rape at Yale remains an in-
visible crime. 

Tragically, an unrepo11ed assaull 
often leaves the attacker free to rape 
again. On a couch near Sarah, Joan sal 
quietly as her friend spoke. Last fall, 
Sarah's assailant attacked Joan, 
although she managed to fight him off. 
The two women had been friends for a 
semester before they realized their 
disturbing bon<J ~ One evening at dinner 
Joan told Sarah of a frightening en-
counter she had with an upperclassman 
earlier that year. Listening to Joan's 
story, Sarah blurted out the name of the 
man. 

Joan believes that Sarah was raped; 
yet, she nonetheless hesitates to call her 
own experience with the same man a 
sexual assault. Rather, Joan minimizes 
her ordeal, perhaps because it conflicts 
with her own stereotypes of sexual 
abuse. "Rape is such a strong word," she 
explained, "and I have a hard time call-
ing what happened to me an attempted 
rape. I mean, I fought him off, so 
nothing sexual happened. He held me 
down, and he did push me around, but 
he didn't tear off my clothing or beat me 
up." 

Joan's voice gradually faded out. She 
sighed heavily and resumed talking. 
•You see, it's hard for me to even think 


--- Page 17 ---

about the incident. I blocked it out of 
my mind almost immediately because it 
was such a horrible experience. 
"It happened in the first or second 
week of school last year. We met on Old 
Campus, and started talking. After 
awhile, he asked me if I wanted to go to 
a bar with him and his roommate. I 
went with them. I mean, I didn't think 
twice about it. All I saw was a really 
neat, attractive Yale man. 
"After spending time at the first bar, 
we went to another one. Everything was 
okay so far. Then his roommate left. 
When. we arrived at the second bar, he 
started being very physical with me- in 
front of everyone. I kept telling him to 
keep his hands off me. It was horrible, 
and I was getting scared. I tried to get 
up and leave, but he wouldn't let me. 
"Later he wanted to show me the 
view from the roof of Bingham. I was 
pretty confused. I tried to tell myself, 
'Well maybe he's doing all this because 
he's attracted to me.' No one, including 
myself, wants to believe that something 
bad is happening to her," said Joan. 
"Anyway, we were walking up to the 
roof, when all of a sudden, he shoved 
me into the old observatory room. He 
blocked the doorway, and I told him I 
wanted to leave. I started to panic. He 
pushed me down and started kissing 
me, and the rest ... you know. It was 
such a physical and emotional struggle. 
"I kept telling him to let me go, and 
he kept asking me what was wrong. He 
kept saying we would be great together. 
I really can't remember how it ended, 
but somehow, I managed to push him 
off with my arms and legs. I ran to the 
door and went downstairs. He followed 
me and tried to apologize. But I knew 
he didn't mean it. 
"I didn't do anything about him," 
Joan said, "because I was a very scared 
freshman. I didn't know what was the 
right thing to do. I just didn't know 
where I could go." 

As is the case at Yale, few students at 
other universities speak out about sex-
ual assault. Those victims who do, 
however, have focused national atten-
tion on acquaintance rape in colleges. 
Recently women at several major in- . 
stitutions have brought rape charges 
against their attackers, both in universi-
ty hearings and courtrooms. Thus far, 
none of the allegations has resulted in a 
conviction of first-degree sexual assault. 
Perhaps the most notorious case in-
volved the University of Pennsylvania 
and its Alpha Tau Omega (ATO) 
fraternity. In February 1983, Penn of-
ficials began investigating an alleged 
gang rape involving A TO members. 
After several court battles the Universi-
ty and the accused students reached a 
settlement: the men had to read books 
and write papers on the topic of rape. 
Following a public out~ry over this ac-
cord, a second investigation resulted in 
a seven-month suspension of the (rater-
nity. At the time of the second Penn in-
vestigation last winter, six men at 
Southern Connecticut State University 
were each sentenced to several years of 
probation for their participation in a 
1981 gang rape of a female student. 
Though five were initially indicted for 
first-degree sexual assault, the charges 
were later reduced because the victim 
refused to testify due to the publicity 
given the trial. 

The growing awareness and in-
cidence of college rape recently haye 
triggered research on the subject. At 
Cornell University, Andrea Parrot, 
Professor of Human Sexuality, and 
Robin Link, B.S. University of Penn-
sylvania, began a study last fall of ac-
quaimtance rape in university settings. 
According to Parrot twenty percent of 
the CorneD student body has been in-
volved in either acquaintance rape or 
The New J ournal/October 19, 1984 17 


--- Page 18 ---

multiple (gang) rape by acquaintances. 
The twenty-percent figure, she believes, 
applies to other universities, including 
Yale. 

Through 
her 
work 
Parrot 
discovered that many victims do not 
report the offense because of their un-
willingness or incapacity to identify 
forced sex as assault. The lack of 
violence in most acquaintance rapes, 
especially, contributes to a victim's in-
ability to recognize the crime. 

Refusing to face the anguish of being 
a victim, other women simply never ad-
mit that a rape occurred. "In the survey, 
women's answers would fit the descrip-
tion of rape, but they would answer 'No' 
when asked if they were rape victims. 
They're saying, 'I don't want to be a 
rape victim. I don't want to think of 
myself in that way. I don't want to think 
of a man I like in that way,'" explained 
Parrot. "Women don't want to believe 
that men they trust would hun them. It 
makes them vulnerable. That's why a 
woman often thinks rape won't happen 
to her." 

In Parrot's research men were also 
reluctant to view forced sex as rape. 
They frequently justified forced inter-
course because the women had express-

ed romantic or friendly inte1111it in 
them, or because they had paid for the 
date. The existence of prior sexual rela-
tions between a man and a woman also 
increased the chance of rape. "Men 
won't call a situation rape because a lot 
of them are playing by different social 
rules than women. They think that 
when a woman says !~o,' she's trying to 
protect her reputation and really means 
'Yes,'" said Parrot. "A lot of these men 
would be appalled if they were arrested 
the next morning for rape. They go to 
sleep thinking that they gave the 
woman a nice time." 

"In an acquaintance or date rape, the 
rapist won't take no for an answer," said 
Dr. A. Nicholas Groth. "He feels like 
he's in control. He makes the victim do 
what he wants her to." As the former 
director of the Sex Offenders Program 
at the Connecticut Correctional In-
stitute in Somers,. 
Groth 
worked 
with rapists for over six years. Stating 
that many differences exist among men 
who rape, Groth divides rapists into 
three primary categories: the anger 
rapist, the power rapist, and the sadistic 
rapis~. According to Groth coUege 
rapists tend to be power rapists unless 
they are retaliating against a specific in-

dividual. The power rapist seeks to 
reinforce his authority and adequacy as 
a man by intimidating or forcing his 
victim into sexual submission. Such an 
attacker's victims are usually his age or 
younger, and he uses only enough force 
to make his victim cooperate. 

When a man rapes, however, society 
rarely sees beyond the violation to the 
attacker's struggles with his own ag-
gressive tendencies. 
Rather, Groth 
asserted that rape often occurs because 
of a man's loss of self control. "Some 
men rape and don't understand why. 
They constantly wrestle with their own 
violent impulses," said Groth. "Others 
don't question what they do but feel 
compelled to do it." 

Groth noted that the college environ-
ment, with all its pressures, may often 
lead to instances of power rape. "It is a 
device which compensates for some 
threat to the offender's sense of worth or 
manhood," he explained. "Men rape 
when they are under great stress or 
when they lack the resources to handle 
the daily stresses. At Yale those strains 
probably stem from academic perfor-
mance and social achievement." 

Slowly, members of the University 
are becoming aware of such men and 
their offenses. The occasional victim 
who wishes to talk about her rape turns 
to a friend, a trusted faculty member, a 
clergyman or an administrator, such as 
her college master. "Violent acts of sex-
ual harassment do occur on the Yale 
campus with greater frequency than 
most of us are willing to admit," said 
one master, who wished to remain 
anonymous. "I wouldn't for a moment 
suggest that a large percentage of 
students are involved, but the smallest 
percentage is too large." 

Last fall, two women approached 
him separately, each telling him that 
she had been assaulted by a man at 
Yale. 

Even before discussing 
disciplinary action, the master urged 
the women to get counseling. "In both 
cues the first thtrig I tried to do was to 
make sure they got personal help to 
restore at least a modicum of self-
esteem," he explained. "Mter there was 
a semblance of control, I told them 
"Men rape when 
they lack the 
resources to handle 
the daily stresses. 
At Yale those 
strains probably 
stem from academic 
performance and 
social achievement." 
about any recourse. One woman was a 
senior, and the incident happened in 
her junior year. It took her a long time 
to step forward finally and make any 
allegations." 

Both women eventually took their 
cases to the Executive Committee, 
although the master would not reveal 
the outcome of the complaints. One of 
many grievance institutions at Yale, the 
Executive Committee addresses any in-
fraction of the Handbook of UndergradUQ.te 
R~gul.aJions, including sexual harassment 
and coercion committed by students. 

The Provost's procedure must be used 
for all "cross unit" complaints: an 
undergraduate who has been attacked 
by a graduate student, or a graduate stu-
dent molested by a student from another 
graduate school. Yale College and most 
of the graduate and professional schools 
also have their own sexual harassment 
grievance boards designed to handle 
complaints against 
University em-
ployees. 

The undergraduate sexual harass-
ment grievance board, an advisory 
board which cannot take punitive ac-
tion, grew out of the 1977 class action 
suit Alextuullr v. Yale. One of the five 
complainants was an undergraduate 
who alleged that she had been raped by 
a Yale music instructor. The plaintiffs 
believe that the University ignored their 
demands for a grievance system, and 
thereby forced them to sue. Although 
the students lost their case in court, the

United They Stand? 
Tony Reese and Jim Lowe 
Vincent Sirabella built Local 35. When 
he came to the union in 1969, its 
members barely earned minimum 
wage. When he left in 1977 they were 
among the highest paid service workers 
in the country. H e returned to New 
Haven last weekend to view Yale's latest 
labor dispute, but this time Local 34, 
the offspring of his Local 35, was on the 
picket line. "It's almost a repeat of the 
prior three strikes with respect to Yale's 
indifference. You have a major world 
institution that can't deal with a large 
group of people it views as inferior to 
what Yale stands for trying to tell it 
what do do." 

Sirabella, now in his sixties, con-
tinues to expend his vast energy on the 
union movement. H e left the service 
and maintenance workers union at 
Yale, Local 35, after a difficult strike in 
1977 and is now national director of 
organization 
for 
the Hotel and 
Restaurant Employees Union, 
the 
parent body of Yale's two Locals. H e 
played a major role in the history of 
labor at Yale, taking his workers out on 
strike three times during his nine years 
as business manager of Local 35. 

In the 43 years of unions here, seven 
strikes have involved three separate 
unions. The shortest was one day in 
1941 and the longest to date was 13 
weeks in 1977. The latest strike differs 
from its predecessors because Local 34 
is one of the first large white-collar 
unions in the country. Nonetheless, 
without Local 35 and its groundbreak-
ing struggles with the University there 
would be no Local 34. 

"Local 35 was demolished in the '68 
strike," Sirabella said. As an outside 
mediator that year he saw Local 35 
crumble after only six days on the picket 
line. "Until 1967 there was an unspoken 
but very real trade-off," said John 
Wilhelm, now chief negotiator for Local 
34 and business manager of Local 35. 
"Wages and benefits were horrendous 
but the University was known as New 
Haven's most humane employer. Then 
the Corporation decided to manage 
their operations 'like a business.' They 
took advantage of a labor contract never 
written with an adversarial relationship 
in mind." 

The University had a different view 
of the situation. "We were in the midst 
of the first big budget cuts," said John 
Wilkinson, then dean of student affairs 
and now secretary of the University. 
"We had an efficiency expert in the 
budget office and he removed a lot of 
positions. Job security became a big 
cry. The cuts were really bad for the 
union, but they were tough for the rest 
of the University as well." 

The results of the 1968 strike forced 
Local 35 to rebuild. It brought in 
Sirabella, the most important labor 
leader in the city, with an eye toward 
the May 1, 1971 contract expiration 
date. 

"I was under the illusion," Sirabella 
remembered, "that if you approached 
the University with facts and figures, 
that as an institution with reason and 
liberal image, that would result in suc-
cess for the union. In an environment 
where light and truth are ideals, logical 
arguments based on documentation 
should mean something. It didn't mean 
a goddamn thing. I found there was no 
other way than to go to the street. 
"I'm not a hateful man, but I came to 
hate the arrogant attitude of Yale. I still 
have a sense of revulsion at the 
phoniness. They're uncaring, insen-
sitive, indifferent and impervious," he 
said. "I'd rather sit across the table from 
a whore or a gangster than Yale. At 
least they're honest about what they 
are." 

In a now familiar pattern the union 
asked for money that up to the day 
before the strike deadline the University 
claimed it didn't have. The University 
also refused binding arbitration. "They 
had to raise wages just to compete in the 
New Haven market; but I told them 
they couldn't buy a contract," Sirabella 
said. The union wanted more than 
money: health care, grievance pro-
cedures and job security. When the 
University produced a package on April 
30 that included wage increases but 
nothing else, the strike was on. 


The 1971 strike came in the midst of 
student protests over the Vietnam War, 
the bombing of Cambodia and the trial 
of the Black Panthers in New Haven. 
Wilkinson recalled leaving his house 
every morning to be met by chanting 
protesters. "They called me every four-, 
seven-, 11- and 15-letter name in the 
book. It is not a period I remember with 
any nostalgia," Wilkinson said. "There 
were moments that were really horrible. 
At one point a group of students went in 
and basically trashed Commons." 

Students flooded Pierson dining hall 
and let the air out of truck tires. A 
group blocked fuel deliveries on Science 
Hill, and 20 to 25 held a four-day 
hunger strike 
on 
Beinecke Plaza. 
Twenty-two were arrested on charges 
including attempted arson and assault 
on an officer with a deadly weapon. 

"The union got student support and 
manipulated it effectively," said Wilkin-
son. "But the breadth of the student 
response had been exaggerated. It 
wasn't massive support. It was intense, 
though." 

The union's effect was both intense 
and massive. The strike dragged on for 
a month and a halt into graduation. On 
Commencement Day Local 35 
mounted its greatest effort to date. Its 
demonstration forced then-President 
Kingman Brewster to alter the tradi-
tional route of the procession for the 
first time in over 200 years and severely 
disrupted the rest of the day's activities. 
A number of protesters, including 
Sirabella, were arrested. When the 
union threatened a repeat performance 
for the alumni reunions later that week 
the University informed them through 
the mediator that it wanted to talk. 
Within two days there was a contract. 

"The union was reborn as a result," 
said Sirabella. "There's nothing like a 
win to raise morale. We got a healthy 
money package and all the contract 
language we wanted." University of-
ficials agree that the union got most of 
what it asked for and more than the 
University had intended to give. "The 
wage increases were out of line in the 
New Haven market," Wilkinson said. 
"And they got the students in the union. 
I still lament that." 

Local 35 went on strike two more 
times in the 1970s. The surprisingly un-
eventful two-and-a-half month 1974 strike 
was resolved through non-binding fact-
finding. 1977 was a different story. 
Kingman Brewster had left and Hanna 
Grey was acting president. Many be-
lieve that the union felt Grey would not 
stand up to the pressure of a strike. "I 
think the union miscalculated on that 
one," said Donald Stevens, director of 
employee relations and chief negotiator 
for the University. 

The University had run a series of 
budget deficits over the preceding years 
and dug in its heels. The strike lasted 13 
weeks. "It was a disaster for everyone," 
Stevens said. "The union got no more 
than we had offered before the strike 
began. It was very divisive." 

The student support, which had been 
important in the earlier strikes, failed to 
develop. "I'm tired of paying increases 
in tuition every year," one student told 
the Yale Daily News. Sirabella noticed 
the change. He said at the time, "The 
students don't give two shits about the 
workers or New Haven. They look 
down their noses at workers." 

The strikes of the 1970s provided a lot 
of lessons for the labor movement at 
Yale. After the devastation of the 1977 
strike, Local 35 elected new leadership 
in 1978, bringing in as its business 
manager John Wilhelm '67, a former 
activist in the Yale chapter of the 
Students for a Democratic Society. 

But relations between the union and 
University changed little. They reached 
two agreements in 1980 and 1982 
without a strike. Stevens points to these 
seven strike-free years and claims that 
the University has begun to build a 
responsible relationship with the union. 
Wilhelm disagrees. "The University has 
never been willing to develop a func-
tional labor relations policy. If Cy 
Vance had negotiated this way in Paris, 
the US Army would still be in 
Vietnam." 

The 1977 strike showed many in 
Local 35 that their strike weapon was 
only partially effective. That union con-
sists of only 1300 of Yale's 9000 
employees, and as Wilhelm said in 
1981, "We don't have the power to cripple 
the University. Our strikes harass 
the University, 
inconvenience 
University, embarrass the University, 
but just in terms of raw power the fact is 
we can't control the University by 
ourselves. We know it and they know it. 
On the other hand if the clerical and 
technical and the service and mainten-
ance people all stood together, that's 
another ball game." 

Local 35 went to bat in November 
1980 with an organizational drive 
aimed at unionizing the C&Ts (clerical 
and technical workers). Similar efforts 
had failed in 1971 and 1977. According 
to Sirabella, the parent organization of 
Local 35 began to pour in what has now 
reached nearly a million dollars to 
organize the C&Ts once and for all. 
They called an election in early 1983, 
and on May 18 of that year the union 
was approved by a vote of 1267 to 1228. 
The victory came despite an inten-
sive three-year effort by the University 
to dissuade C&Ts from joining Local 34. 
Wages were increased by over 30 per-
cent and the administration hired the 
Hartford-based law firm of Seigal, 
O'Connor and Kanin, known to labor 
leaders as notorious "union-busters." 

The creation of Local 34 depended in 
large part on the earlier demonstrable 
success of Local 35. Its members, 
among the highest-paid service and 
maintenance workers in the country, 
served as an inspiration to the less well-
paid C&Ts. Many of the latter saw 
these gains first hand through their 
relatives in Local 35. "The C&Ts finally 
realized they had to have a union," 
Sirabella said. "Even $50 million and 50 
John Wilhelms couldn't have done for 
the organization of 34 what 35's 
achievements did." 

The financial successes of Local 35 
were essential in overcoming white col-
lar worker's negative perceptions of 
unions in general and of Local 35 in 
particular. In 1982 Jerald Stevens, then 
University vice-president for finance 
and administration, noted, "If you look 
at the history of relationships between 
the University and Local 35, I think 
that very few clerical and technical 
employees would like to experience 
that." 

"A lot of things happened—especially 
physical damage—that in retrospect I 
wish hadn't," said Sirabella of the Local 
35 strikes. "The white-collar workers 
didn't want any part of that." Relations 
were strained on the other side as well. 
When the members of Local 35 struck 
three times in the late 1970s, the 
C&Ts—still non-union—remained at 
work and often filled in for the striking 
workers. 

Strained relations have failed to play 
a role in the latest strike. "The majority 
of both unions are working class," said 
Wilhelm. "The distinction between blue 
and white collar is fake and largely due 
to employment stereotypes. The 
economy has shifted to a service base 
and workers have gone where the jobs 
are. Differences in types of jobs don't 
mean the workers are so different." 

"There's a very strong affinity 
developing between the two unions," 
Sirabella concurred. "The members of 
Local 35 are sophisticated enough to 
know that if Local 34 goes down they're 
going to keep having strikes and lousy 
settlements. They see their support as a 
short-term investment in long-term 
benefits for both unions." 

Aside from its relationship with Local 
35, the C&Ts face internal difficulties. 
The Local 34 bargaining unit includes 
typists and computer operators, athletic 
trainers and lab technicians, spread 
throughout almost every department at 
Yale. This diversity has clearly been a 
factor in the union's inability to gain the 
unqualified support and membership of 
more than 1700 of the total 2600 
workers in the C&T bargaining unit. 

The union charges that the University 
believes this diversity will eventually 
split Local 34 and end the strike. "I 
don't know why the University operates 
on the theory that they won't support 
each other," said Wilhelm. "That's one 
of their two biggest miscalculations." 

There had been a similar disunity 
within Local 35 that the 1971 strike 
overcame. "There were a lot of highly 
skilled maintenance tradesmen who 
thought they had nothing in common 
with the housekeeping and dining hall 
people," Sirabella said. "To make the 
strike effective we had to overcome 

While members of Local 34 marched on 
the picket line, George Conte began to 
prepare for negotiations with Yale on 
Local 35's contract, which expires 
January 17, 1985. Conte, who is 
worker president of that union, is 
organizing department meetings to 
determine workers' needs and concerns. 
In the University's Department of 
Employee Relations, Donald Stevens 
prepares for those same negotiations 
which should begin sometime next 
month. "We're doing wage and benefit 
surveys right now to examine the posi-
tion of the bargaining unit with relation 
to the market," Stevens said. 

With or without the strike, these 
promise to be difficult negotiations. The 
1982 settlement gave the union a very 
small salary increase but promised some 
major changes in working conditions. 
The University points to this settlement 
as a turning point in its labor relations. 
"We'd hoped progress was being 
made," said Wilhelm, "especially on job 
security and benefits. They threw those 
promises to the wind after they signed 
in '82. These very serious broken prom-
ises will be the focus of Local 35's 
negotiations." The union fears the 
University will eventually hire outside 
contractors 
its grounds and 
buildings maintenance, as Harvard has 
already begun to do. This would further 
cut the membership of a Local that has 
seen 
its 
numbers cut 
drastically 
through attrition over the past 15 
years. The union hopes to remove the 
no-strike clause from its contract, alter 
other language and gain wage and 
benefit improvements. 

"The University has to decide it will 
do what most employers do: avoid 
strikes," Wilhelm said. "It has not done 
anything that normal people would call 
negotiating in any of these strikes. It has 
to do something other than try to dictate 
settlements." 

Donald Stevens disagreed. "The 
University has been very open. We're 
trying to be responsive to what the 
employees perceive as their needs. 
We're not in any way attacking or belit-
tling the union," he said. "John Wilhelm 
is a very effective labor leader and I've 
always felt he was very realistic. He says 
the University has to reorder its 
priorities. I disagree with him. But the

"There's nothing like

morale." 
University continues to want to build a 
responsible relationship." 
Wilhelm's own bargaining tactics 
have not gone unquestioned. A white-
collar union leader in the region pointed 
out that Local 34 may be trying to do 
too much at once. "In first contracts it is 
traditional to simply set out a working 
relationship with the University and get 
modest improvements elsewhere. The 
big issues-wages, benefits and so forth 
-are usually dealt with in later con-
tracts." 


The situation with the Local 34 strike 
can only make the Local 35 negotiations 
more difficult. "I hope it has no effect," 
said Donald Stevens, "but a strike 
always does damage to employer-
employee relations." 


"I believe that this strike will have a 
very profound effect on the 35 negotia-
tions," said Wilhelm. "If Local 35 
spends X number of weeks honoring 
the line, that will only increase their 
determination to achieve their own ob-
jectives." Wilhelm asserts that the 
University believes Local 35 will be 
worn out and broke come January. 
"Yale thinks it'll be able to call the tune. 
That miscalculation will result in the 
destruction of the entire school year." 


If Local 35 strikes in January, will 
Local 34 hit the streets with them? The 
unity shown in the first three weeks of 
the Local 34 strike leads some to say 
yes. "Because of the goodwill generated 
between the two unions, 34 will walk 
off: said Sirabella. "There's no question 
of that. They couldn't possibly not sup-
port 35." 


The strength of LOCal 34's internal 
unity, however, remains a question 
mark. By last week 41 percent of the 
C&Ts in the bargaining unit were 
Working, up from 37 percent during the 
fint week of the strike. The members of 
Local 34 also do not have the tradition 
of strong unionism that exists in Local 
35: even though they were not the ones to 
call the strike, 95 percent of Local 35's 
members refused to report to work . 


The outcome of the latest strike m ight 
depend on the Yale Corporation. "Some 
of the most influential people in the 
country sit on the Corporation," said 
Sirabella. "And they have interlocking 
relations with many other influential 
people. I have no doubt whatever that 
consitierable influence has been exerted 
on Cy Vance, Richardson Dillworth 
and the others to resist this strike so the 
anti-union pattern of the last few years 
is not interrupted. 


"The Corporation is not just an 
antique collection that is put on display 
once in a while," Sirabella continued. 
"They're important people and they're 
calling the shots. The President of Yale 
really has little to say." 


Sirabella points to the mutual sup-
port of the two unions as part of ~ow­
ing atmosphere of harmony among 
unions. "There is mo.re of a mood of 
cooperation within the whole labor 
movement now than since the 1930s." 


In the University's view, however, the 
cooperation of the two unions is far 
from crippling. Throughout the conflict 
with Local 34, Michael Finnerty, vice-
president for admi~istration, has said, 
"The University can hold out as long as 
necessary." He and others in the ad-
ministration say publicly that the addi-
tion of Local 34 has changed the situa-
tion very little. 


Sirabella disagrees and feels labor at 
Yale may be at a turning point. "The 
unity between the two unions can 
restore some kind of balanced relation-
ship which would hopefully end labor 
hostility at Yale. When Yale has the 
feeling it can stampede its workers, 
there's going to be trouble. If you 
balance the equation again, then people 
will start talking about issues. T hat was 
the dream throughout the '70s, and it 
looks like it is becoming a reality."

"There was a time when people, because they 
didn't know how to bracket me, were really on 
edge. I used to play these clubs downtown

-Dwight Andrews 

It's hard trying to describe Dwight An-
drews. Which picture seems "more 
Dwight" than others? On Sunday 
mornings in the All Purpose Room of 
the Afro-American Cultural Center 
(the House), a dark brown-skinned 
man preaches at the Black Church at 
Yale (BCA Y) in front of a banner 
which reads, "God Have Mercy on 
Me." His preaching style lacks the fiery 
"mmm" and heavy beat of traditional 
black preachers. He delivers the sub-
ject, invariably political and religious, 
in an everyday lecture style. Andrews 
adds touches of rhythm in the end to 
make a 
point. 
The 
black 
robe 
with red pan stripes down the front 
hangs almost to the ground, disguising 
a slight bulge. On the wall above him, 
a Paul Robeson poster among pictures 
of other black 
historical 
figures 
represents a tradition that Andrews 
continues at Yale. 

Late one Friday Andrews, decked 
out in a denim jumpsuit, saunters 
through an audience full of new faces. 
En route to the bandstand he grabs the 
hands of various people sitting around 
the small tables in a New York jazz 
club. The lights dim. He joins ~ 
members of his ensemble as they warm 
up on the stage. Earthy jazz chords 
come from tht· keyboards, drums, bass 
and xylophone. The musicians look 
stem and so does he. Sweat dripping off 
the side of his face, Andrews sips some 
water. "'ne, two, one two three" and a 
mellow sound drifts from the alto sax, 
blending with the melodies in the 
background. After a song or two to

For Andrews, more work remains as 
long as distorted perceptions of black 
culture continue at Yale. The very ex-
istence of BCA Y, he said, "helps to re-
mind people that we still have race 
problems on campus. If white people 
don't acknowledge that they have a 
very hung-up attitude about race, then 
they'll never be able to move from it, 
and if black kids think that just because 
they are here in New Haven they can 
someho~ get away from who they real-
ly are, then they are also naive." 


Dwight interprets BCA Y as a spiritual 
forum for many religious, social and 
political problems. "You don't have to 
be black to be a part of BCA Y, you 
have to be able to understand the kind 
of 'black' struggles that oppressed peo-
ple face all around the world. Yale 
needs voices that aren't a part of their 
purse strings. BCAY maintains such a 
dialogue." 


Andrews acts as a nexus in this ex-
change of ideas, 
which 
reaches 
students, faculty and visiting intellec-
tuals. "It's been important to bring all 
of the aspects of my life into a dialogue 
with black thinkers who have passed 
through Yale. Hanging out and talking 
with people 
like Derek Wolcott, 
Baraka, June Jordan and Toni Mor-
rison- those contacts changed my life. 
When we start talking about the future 
of black people and the role of art in 
politics, I can hang. I am one of them. 
We share many of the same goals and 
interests." 


In all of these glimpses of Andrews, 
he is always with people. At the end of 
the church service, the members and 
visitors hold hands, forming a circle 
which fills the room. Voices join in a 
gospel song. Around the room, blacks, 
along with Asians, Hispanics and 
whites, sway to the music. Andrews 
sm iles, singing, "We~ve come this far 
by faith, leaning on the Lord, trusting 
in H is holy word, H e's never failed me 
yet." There is elecfricity: people, faith, 
community. And wholeness.
