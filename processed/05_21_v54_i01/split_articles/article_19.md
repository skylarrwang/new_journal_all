THE  NEW  JOURNAL
innocuous as the SWAN website 
has to be hosted on a server in Ice­
land, because it could be seen as 
illegal in the United States. 
Some of the sex workers I spoke 
with at the Leadership Develop­
ment Program, like Glenda, cited 
housing insecurity as the greatest 
threat to their safety and the most 
revelant factor in 
their susceptibility 
to trafficking and 
coercion. In the 
GHJP and SWAN 
joint report, 58 
percent 
of 
res­
pondents said that 
they were hou­
sing insecure. Sex 
workers’ 
safety 
is 
inextricably 
intertwined with 
s o c i o e c o n o m i c 
insecurity, addic­
tion, 
the 
legal 
system, and gen­
der-based 
vio­
lence, and refor­
mers have their 
eyes set on foun­
dational 
change. 
“Systemic 
over­
hauls 
are 
what 
we need,” Miller 
said. “And the way 
to do the overhaul 
is created by the 
day-to-day unders­
tanding of your interaction with 
those systems. It’s not an either/
or—it’s a both, and.” Progress, 
Miller explained, is tied to efforts 
currently underway to decrimi­
nalize homelessness, to establish 
overdose prevention facilities with 
an adequate number of beds for 
women, and to reform drug and 
criminal policy. 
Captain David Zannelli unders­
tands the criticism of his officers, 
and he said that he tries to work 
with SWAN when he can—and 
they often have reached compro­
mises—but that he couldn’t dis­
regard crimes. “We can’t ignore 
community members that actually 
live in the Ferry Street area who 
have a complaint,” he said. Ferry 
Street is a high-traffic road in Fair 
Haven, lined with businesses and 
densely packed houses. During 
the day, kids play outside and resi­
dents walk to local markets and 
churches. It’s also where many sex 
workers gather to find work, and 
members of the community have 
been complaining about that to 
the police department for a long 
time. Zannelli explained that it 
was difficult to appease the com­
munity while also transitioning 
away from a punitive status quo. 
Still, he claimed to be happy to 
work with SWAN when he could.
“At the end of the day, we want 
the behavior to stop.” By behavior, 
he’s referring to drug-use and sex 
acts in public, loitering, and lea­
ving needles in playgrounds. “We 
can’t allow that. I’m not gonna 
have that,” he said. But he would 
prefer to do that without arresting 
sex workers. Zannelli recognized 
that sex workers are often cau­
ght up in cycles, 
and he tries to call 
Beatrice so that 
she can arrive at 
the scene and talk 
to the sex wor­
kers herself. He 
also said that he 
sometimes talks to 
churches to help 
find the workers 
a place to go for 
the night. Zan­
nelli 
acknowle­
dged that there 
was progress to be 
made. “We have 
some work to do. 
I’m not saying that 
we do everything 
perfectly, 
‘cause 
we don’t, and we 
do have mistakes,” 
he said. 
Jaclyn 
Luci­
bello, 
SWAN’s 
Director 
Outreach, belie­
ves there is still plenty of room for 
improvement when it comes to 
repairing the relationship between 
sex workers and the police. 
“Things are definitely getting bet­
ter,” she said. “But we're far away 
from those open lines of commu­
nication between sex workers and 
police officers.”


In the meantime, sex workers 
are doing what they can to keep 
themselves safe. According to 
Glenda, it gets worse every day 
on the streets. Kimberly agreed, 
saying, “People drive by—a few 


years ago on Halloween, there was 
people throwing eggs and stuff. 
And then there were people going 
around shooting the workers.” She 
was referring to a recent pattern of 
people shooting sex workers with 
paintball guns. “It was really bad. 
And there are a lot of people dying 
and shit, too. From addictions and 
stuff like that. Depression too… 
you get very depressed. There are 
times when I just want to end it. 
But God put me here for a reason.”

Being able to comfortably talk 
to someone is important for these 
women. “The group’s really hel­
pful for venting,” Lindsay said, 
referring to SWAN. Beatrice helps 
her “get help, get counseling.” She 
sees the therapists who work with 
SWAN. 

All the women make use of the 
resources SWAN distributes, such 
as needles and condoms, and they 
all said that they carry a blade to 
protect themselves. Some also 
carry mace. 

Christine said, “I carry a knife 
because once you’re in a car with 
somebody and something really 
fucked happens, it’s just you and 
them.” She referenced self-defense 
classes that SWAN hosted before 
the pandemic. “I was asking ques­
tions like—and I wasn't trying to 
be funny—if my head is in some­
body’s lap, I'm in the car with 
somebody, and somebody comes 
down like that”—she brought 
her elbow down hard—“how am 
I going to defend myself? Self 
defense is person-to-person, face-
to-face.”

Kimberly, who is 50 years old 
and has been a sex worker since 
she was 14, also said that it was 
necessary to be able to defend 
yourself. “If I do have to fight 
somebody, I'll fight them. I carry 
a blade on me.”

Jasmine said that she trusts her 
instincts, and if she has a bad fee­
ling about a date, then she won’t 
go. “When I'm scared about being 
[robbed], I'll try to go somewhere 
I know there’s a camera, like a 
street camera or security camera. 
Preferably somewhere really well-
lit or populated.”

Still, many of the women have 
people they can depend on for 
support. Christine said that she 
knows there are people who are 
invested in her safety. “If there’s 
ever an emergency, I can call on 
people all the time… My people 
[at SWAN] and my people on 
the street, and I got family that 
support and love me.”

Kimberly was wearing a SWAN 
shirt, bright purple with a small 
sketch of an actual swan on the 
front. She said her husband was a 
source of support, who she endea­
ringly referred to as a “big baby.” 
He’s blind, so the two of them take 
care of each other. She told me 
that his protectiveness sometimes 
annoyed her. But she affectiona­
tely added, “That’s what I signed 
up for when I married him.”

Christine also said that she and 
the other workers look out for 
each other. 
“All of us street people, the 
majority of us, it’s like we’re a big 
dysfunctional family,” she said. 
“Even though one day one person 
might hate the other person, they 
may be angry at the person, some­
body may steal from somebody or 
do something stupid—for the most 
part, there’s a big group of people 
that wouldn’t let the other person 
get hurt. There’s a lot of loyalty.”

I asked her what that looked 
like, and she explained. “Let’s say 
I get thrown out of a car and Kim 
comes across me, she’s walking 
down the street and I’m beat up. 
She’s going to pick me up. We’ve 
got a tight group of people.”

“This one’s always helping peo­
ple,” Jaclyn said, and everyone 
laughed while Christine smiled. 
“They call me the mother,” 
Christine said. “‘She's our mother 
out here.’ And I do, I even scold 
them.”
