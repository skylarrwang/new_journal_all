**Title: ON THE ROOF OF WATSON**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
This weekend, I found myself at a party with twenty 
strangers on the roof of the Watson Center. It felt 
unlikely and illegal, and thus important and correct—
probably the sentiments of every person who’s ever 
hung out on a roof of an institutional building. There 
was cheap, sweet rosé. There was talk of holy shit I’m 
so glad we aren’t first years anymore and are you kidding 
at least we aren’t in high school anymore. Every minute 
or two, a motion-sensitive floodlight blinked on, at 
which point whatever conversation I was jiving with 
was met with a horrible overhead brightness, pointing 
out flaws in faces you would normally choose to ignore 
in the gush of meeting someone new and interesting. 
It was as if a helicopter were hovering above, blaring its 
spotlight and shouting STOP You Have Been Caught In 
the Act of Trying to Be NICE and Make FRIENDS, and 
then turning off to signal never mind and that actually 
you may carry on. After a year and a half of constantly 
halted socialization, it’s nice to carry on. Even if it’s stop 
and go.


**Title: SALOVEY’S GARDEN**
**Author: NANKI CHUGH**

Last year, as “let’s grab a meal” gave way to “let’s go 
for a walk,” Yale students stumbled upon 43 Hill­
house, a quasi-public garden of rolling lawns and 
sprawling oaks that makes up the backyard of Pres­
ident Salovey and Marta Moret, design courtesy of 
Master Gardener Moret. “It feels like we shouldn’t be 
allowed to be there,” said one undergraduate student. 
But the pandemic transformed the once-exclusive 
space into a more inviting one, as the community 
began to use the yard for walks, picnics, and reflec­
tion. I celebrated my 21st birthday there, laying my 
blanket under the shade of a gracious oak, enjoy­
ing the balmy breeze with friends as we munched 
on grapes and cheese. It seems the space is here to 
stay this fall; Salovey told me via email that he’s 
“delighted to share this beautiful open space with the 
community.”
