T
he garden had been used as a dumping 
ground. Raised beds strangled by overgrown 
weeds, trash strewn about, wet slabs of 
mushroom-speckled wood perfuming the area with 
a mildewy odor. It was our job—myself and a crew 
of New Haven residents—to revitalize this less-than-
one-acre plot on Adeline Street, run by Integrated 
Refugee & Immigrant Services (IRIS). It was March 
of 2021, and the weather was unseasonably warm. I 
spent hours pruning tree branches with a saw to let 
crops catch sunlight; shoveling hot woodchips into 
wheelbarrows; yanking weeds from the soil, then 
depositing them into a white bucket. Occasionally I’d 
find a used Band-Aid or the plastic lining of a Doritos 
bag, a reminder that I was not in a pastoral country­
side but in New Haven, that I was flanked not by 
farms and forests but by tire shops and gas stations. 
Even during the rehabilitation process, though, on a 
street lined with blue-grey houses, the garden was a 
welcome patch of green.
Karen Grossi has spent her life tending to such 
patches of green. She started gardening at age four, 
and for a few years worked as a small-scale organic 
farmer in Holyoke, MA. 
During the pandemic, while volunteering as a 
food delivery driver for the Semilla Collective (an 
organization that distributes food among Latinx 
New Haveners), Grossi watched community hun­
ger escalate in real time. She knew she could be 
doing more. In March of 2020, Grossi and a group 
of acquaintances began planting crops in unused 
garden plots across the city, including the Adeline 
Street garden. The “ad hoc group,” as Grossi calls 
it—believing the term “organization” too official for 
the rotating cabal of five to twelve gardeners—took 
on the moniker Mutual Aid Growers.
Some of the empty garden spaces were aban­
doned because of the pandemic; others, like the 
Adeline Street garden, were in complete disarray. 
Volunteers also grew in their personal gardens; Tina 
Dodge, another leader of the organization, built two 
new beds in her backyard to accommodate extra 
seedlings. Over the course of the summer of 2020, 
Mutual Aid Growers grew more than 500 pounds of 
produce, all of which went to hungry New Haven 
families. 
Mutual Aid Growers is not the only New Haven 
organization using horticulture to fight hunger. 
With well over fifty community gardens, New 
Haven has one of the highest rates of community 
gardens per capita of any city in the United States. 
Most of these gardens are run by Gather New Haven. 
Eliza Caldwell, the community garden manager for 
Gather, explained to me, “The goal is to get food 
close to people’s houses, so they don’t have to go 
somewhere and get it.” 
But when the pandemic hit, Gather was caught 
off guard. The group had only formed two months 
before mass closures and quarantine, through a 
merger of the New Haven Land Trust and New 
Haven Farms in January 2020. Its staff was mostly 
new and therefore unprepared for the administra­
tive nightmare of COVID-19. “There was so much 
change at that time that it feels like we were just 
trying to navigate how to do things,” Caldwell said. 
“And I feel pretty bad saying that because, we should 
[have] been, I don’t know, more active, I suppose.”
However, Gather was certainly not inactive 
during the early pandemic. Individual gardeners 
like Mary-Ann Moran took it upon themselves to 
improve food accessibility in their local communi­
ties. Moran, who serves as the community garden 
manager for the gardens in Fair Haven, on the city’s 
east side, has worked throughout the pandemic to 
make fresh produce available in libraries, substa­
tions, and schools across her community—free of 
charge, available to be picked up by anyone in need.
Still, it’s easy to understand why Caldwell felt 
that Gather should have done more: after national 
hunger rates reached a twenty-year low in 2019, 
they spiked in 2020. In New Haven, food insecurity 
rates hit 16.2 percent, the highest of any county in 
Connecticut, marking a 33.5 percent increase since
