here’s a side to New 
Haven that comes alive in 
the quiet of night, while 
most people in the city 
are dreaming. The city’s animal 
residents wake up and wander 
through the darkness: Families 
of rabbits. Colonies of stray cats. 
Packs of coyotes and deer.

Scott Cadwell knows this side of 
the city better than most. He has 
lived in New Haven's Hill neigh­
borhood for the past four years, 
and he often doesn’t sleep through 
the night. His home, beneath a 
bridge in the Hill, has a ceiling 
but no walls. The rain and snow 
can’t reach him, but the rest of the 
natural world can. Some nights, 
he watches the creatures dance 
between fight and flight as they 
weigh options for survival. He 
can clearly picture a wild rabbit 
he once saw by a ravine near his 
bridge, on a night he had stayed 
up late to smoke a cigarette. He 
remembers the rabbit was trem­
bling. After looking around, he 
spotted the threat: a bobcat about 
fifty feet away.


Predators can turn into prey, 
depending on the context. Cad­
well has seen clusters of thirty 
coyotes scuttling atop garbage 
mounds. The creatures are known 
for eating small animals and occa­
sionally attacking human beings, 
but Cadwell likes to say, “They’re 
more scared of you than you are 
of them.” One night, according to 
Cadwell, a coyote darted beneath 
his bridge. It lay down, shuddering 
in fear. “There’s gotta be a bigger 
predator right around here,” Cad­
well recalls thinking. When he 
turned, he saw the silhouette of 
what looked like a mountain lion 
slinking by. “I didn’t sleep that 
night really,” he said with half a 
laugh.


It’s possible that the mountain 
lion was really a bobcat, since 
environmental agencies believe 
that cougars have gone extinct in 
Connecticut. But Cadwell is con­
vinced it was a cougar. A former 
hunter, he claims to have seen 
mountain lion tracks in the city 
before.


Cadwell, a 52-year-old white 
man with a crooked, bony frame, 
has been homeless for five years. 
“I’m a survivor,” he said. While 
he has spent brief stints in home­
less shelters, away from the cold, 
most of the time he is one of the 
nearly three hundred Connecticut 
residents living on the streets. He 
can twist and bend his chronically 
dislocated left shoulder in nearly 
any direction; he’s a certified 
welder, but his shoulder prevents 
him from finding work. While 
some can’t fathom why he would 
choose the outdoors over a shelter, 
Cadwell doesn’t mind the wildlife 
that prowls through the city at 
night. His animal neighbors don’t 
bother him, and he doesn’t bother 
them back.


While some can’t 
fathom why he would 
choose the outdoors 
over a shelter, 
Cadwell doesn’t 
mind the wildlife 
that prowls through 
the city at night. His 
animal neighbors 
don’t bother him, and 
he doesn’t bother 
“They’re just trying to 
live out there,” Cadwell said. “Just 
trying to live.”


Cadwell’s bridge hangs over 
a set of train tracks, where New 
Haven borders the town of West 
Haven. He doesn’t technically live 
on transit property, but railroad 
workers sometimes interrogate 
him regardless. One day in early 
spring, he said, a maintenance 
worker began taking photographs 
of his encampment, without even 
greeting him. “I need to report 
this,” the worker had said. No one 
has formally required Cadwell to 
leave yet, but the thought of his 
image stored in a stranger’s phone 
bothered him.


Cadwell is no stranger to 
encounters like these, in which 
people who do not ask his name 
pressure him to take his things and 
go. One Thanksgiving, he and 
his mother wandered into West 
Haven to watch the boats docking 
at the Long Island Sound. A police 
officer approached them and asked 
what they were doing, where they 
were from. When Cadwell men­
tioned he was from New Haven, 
he recalls the cop replying: “This 
is what I want you to do: get 
in that car and go back to New 
Haven. If I see your fucking ass 
over that bridge again, you’ll get 
arrested and go to jail.” Cadwell 
and his mom had not been break­
ing any laws. They had simply 
been sitting by the water. The 
pair walked back to New Haven, 
rattled.


People who live outside, like 
Cadwell—on park benches, in 
tents, beneath bridges—often need 
to pick up and leave at a moment’s 
notice. In New Haven, police 
and city officials have historically 
moved to clear and disperse out­
door encampments. In defense 
of one such eviction, the city’s 
homeless 
services 
coordinator, 
Velma George, told the New 
Haven Independent in 2019 that 
“we want people to move out of 
these unsafe conditions to more 
safe conditions.” Other forced 
movements, like the West Haven 
officer’s command to Cadwell and 
his mom, highlight the precarious 
existence of people like Cadwell.
