evangelize Nazi ideas to popula­
tions that had no choice but to 
hear them. Tapping the talent of 
people like him was essential to 
the Nazis’ war effort. 
Now OSI had to prove Sokolov 
was eager for the call. So they 
went to Moscow. There, under 
Soviet supervision, OSI took 
depositions and dug through 
thousands of Gestapo files the Red 
Army had seized after the fall of 
Berlin, translated and forensically 
authenticated them, and cross-
checked any names they found 
against U.S. immigration records. 
If they got a positive ID, they 
opened an investigation.     
For Sokolov, they found a 
Nazi background check dated 
July 8, 1943, just before the Ger­
mans evacuated Orel, which read: 
“Enthusiastic 
co-worker 
and 
trustworthy propaganda orator. 
As a consequence of his marked 
anti-Bolshevist attitude is slightly 
inclined to tendentious state­
ments.” There it was, in hand­
written German: enthusiastic.   
The 
defense 
denied 
every 
charge OSI laid: that Sokolov 
knew about the Nazi genocide, 
that he had volunteered his ser­
vices out of anything other than 
desperation or anticommunism, 
that he had written the antise­
mitic portions of the articles, that 
he had downplayed his involve­
ment with the newspaper when 
interviewing with Immigration. 
The logic was knotted, but their 
point was to bypass the mounting 
archival indictment of his charac­
ter with a human story. 
This story followed a string 
of clichés. At the paper, he said 
he was “under orders” or doing 
what he could to support his 
family. Through contacts at the 
Expert Commission of Russians 
Abroad—a monarchist organi­
zation working to preserve the 
bones of dead Romanovs—the 
defense managed to track down 
Clifford Smith, a former employee 
of the Displaced Persons Commis­
sion, to tell the court that Sokolov, 
whom he hadn’t met until several 
days before the trial, was actually a 
“forced laborer” in Nazi-occupied 
Orel, and that “as a forced laborer 
he has no control over what he 
says.” In cross-ex, Joe Lynch asked 
Smith point-blank: “Are you tell­
ing me that you have agreed to 
testify on behalf of a man about 
whom you know absolutely noth­
ing?” Smith replied, “Yes, sir.”
rest 
of 
the 
amounted to a total denial of any 
responsibility for the words that 
appeared under Sokolov’s byline. 
Sokolov 
himself 
testified 
that 
Mikhail Oktan, whom the Nazis 
eventually made editor-in-chief, 
“demanded that we, the employ­
ees, write against Jews and if we 
wrote different [sic] he took them 
and changed them, and sometimes 
I didn't recognize my own arti­
cles. I didn't recognize them.” 
Sokolov’s lead attorney, Brian 
Gildea, was familiar with these 
sorts of cases. From 1977 to 1984, 
he had defended, eventually before 
the Supreme Court, Feodor Fedo­
renko, an ex-guard at Treblinka, 
the extermination camp where 
the Nazis killed nearly a million 
Jews. Gildea got into the busi­
ness of defending Nazis on trial 
for deportation while working 
the immigration circuit at a New 
Haven law firm. He told me that 
he had always been fascinated by 
the Second World War. The work 
let him revisit fragments of it in 
the flesh. 
Throughout 
Sokolov’s 
trial, 
Gildea was meeting regularly 
with William F. Buckley, Jr., the 
face of patrician Yale and the 
founder of the National Review. 
Buckley had become obsessed 
with the Sokolov case as a kind of 
frontline in the Cold War, calling 
Gildea at least a dozen times over 
several years, dining with him in 
New York, and writing a personal 
letter to President Ronald Rea­
gan, pleading for his intervention 
in the case. The letter landed on 
the desk of future Chief Justice of 
the Supreme Court John Roberts, 
who at the time was working as 
an assistant to the Attorney Gen­
eral. In the letter, Buckley men­
tions that Strobe Talbott, a former 
student of Sokolov’s who later 
became Deputy Secretary of State 
under Bill Clinton, had vouched 
for him and called the scandal a 
KGB ploy. 
Reagan stayed out of it and the 
DOJ let the investigation pro­
ceed. In 1986, the court revoked 
Sokolov’s citizenship; a year later, 
he and Gildea took the case to 
the Court of Appeals. And when 
the Court upheld the first verdict, 
Gildea pressed for an encore at 
the Supreme Court. But Sokolov 
didn’t want the trouble. Instead, 
he wrote a letter to a Russian 
Orthodox monk at a monastery 
in Montreal, who agreed to give 
him sanctuary, and fled the coun­
try. Sokolov died there five years 
later, outliving the Soviet Union 
by a month. 


In 1966, long before his flight 
to Canada, still a fixture of Yale’s 
Russian 
Department, 
Vladimir 
Sokolov attended the thirty-fourth 
International Congress of the 
P.E.N Writers’ Club. The scene 
must have been poignant to him, 
in a way. He was in the import­
ant room at the literary congress, 
where he always wanted to be. 
But he received no awards. He 
wasn’t a star. He was spectating. 
The fiction he wrote had never 
been especially well-received. It 
was never even translated into 
English. 
But even as his career as a novel­
ist was going, and went, nowhere, 
Sokolov had invented a powerful 
literary character, creating and 
recreating a fictional version of 
himself that was the perfect piece 
of propaganda: a falsehood so 
total and so flexible that it held for 
decades, across borders and gov­
ernments, among Nazi officers, 
FBI agents, and members of the 
Yale faculty. The character was 
a Russian patriot, impressed into 
service by an occupying power; 
he had survived the war by a mir­
acle, provided for his family, and 
worked hard to establish himself 
in America as a man of letters; he 
had convictions, stuck to them, 
and championed the oppressed; 
he was kind to students, patient in 
class, modest to a fault; he led a 
quiet life in suburban Connecti­
cut.
This character was believable, 
sympathetic even. But he was not 
Vladimir Sokolov. Sokolov was a 
Nazi.
