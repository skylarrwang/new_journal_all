ASIDE
THE FARMINGTON 
CANAL HERITAGE 
TRAIL
BY ELI MENNERICK
In the 1830s, a canal ran from 
Northampton, Massachusetts to 
New Haven Harbor. Horses hauled 
boats through water four feet deep. 
The canal failed to profit, and soon it 
became a railroad. The railroad failed, 
too, and in the nineteen-nineties, it 
became an eighty-four-mile bike path 
called the Farmington Canal Heri­
tage Trail. In summer and fall, when 
the trees are leafy, dappled shadows 
spill over the pavement. Biking 
into New Haven, you ride through 
Newhallville, then past Yale Health 
and Benjamin Franklin College. The 
path ends at a closed gate beneath 
Temple Street, about ten blocks 
from the canal’s original terminus 
at Long Wharf. For a decade, New 
Haven tried and failed to close that 
gap. Finally, in August, construction 
began.
