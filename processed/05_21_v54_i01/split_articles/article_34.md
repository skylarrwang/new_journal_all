ASIDES
EAST HADDAM
BY ELI MENNERICK 
For our day trip, we drove to East 
Haddam—forty minutes from New 
Haven and home to the Devil’s 
Hopyard State Park. Supposedly, 
The Devil grows his hops there. 
We hiked around for a while—past 
a waterfall, over some boulders—
without seeing anything very 
satanic. For lunch, we stopped at a 
café called Higher Grounds. Along 
with our fifteen-dollar breakfast 
burritos, the barista placed on our 
tray a fresh marijuana leaf. We sat 
out back at a damp picnic table; 
the other patrons sat in a circle and 
passed around a joint. Drew found 
a hair in his burrito, then a small, 
wiggling worm. None of us found 
the courage to ask for a refund.

FLOODS, 
BY ALEXANDRA 
GALLOWAY 
From our fifth floor Davenport 
suite, we stick our heads out the 
window to feel the rain kiss our 
faces. We peel the red wax off all 
the Babybel cheese in our fridge. 
“Before it goes bad,” we say, eating 
it all. Below us, white tents in the 
courtyard sag and collapse, little 
empires going to shit. We can’t hear 
the alarms blaring, but we can see 
the white strobe flash through the 
windows of the library. Blinking, 
blinking, blinking, sending a futile 
Morse code as barefoot first-years 
and upperclassmen, brandishing 
flashlights, wander in the dark 
floodwaters. The start of the end, my 
suitemate muses.
