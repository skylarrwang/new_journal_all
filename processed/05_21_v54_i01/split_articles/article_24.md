torf to apply for a visa. Sokolov’s 
strongsuit had always been plead­
ing his case, explaining and ingra­
tiating himself to an interrogator. 
When he interviewed for the visa, 
he told the Commission a version 
of his story that he thought they’d 
like best. He came from a family 
of landowners close to the Tsar. 
He had been a fugitive from the 
Soviet secret police. He had been 
a “proofreader” for an “anti-com­
munist” newspaper in occupied 
Russia. He rose through the ranks 
in the emigré press in Germany. 
He wanted to take his talents to 
America. He wanted to fight the 
communists. 

He was approved for the visa 
in a matter of weeks and arrived 
in New York on June 27. The 
Tolstoy Foundation—which ear­
lier that year had been saved from 
bankruptcy by the CIA—helped 
him and other White Russian 
notables settle into the new coun­
try. 

IV.
At 38, Sokolov was determined 
to make himself an important lit­
erary figure and was already con­
templating his memoirs. He was 
still writing as Samarin—his Nazi 
pen name—in America,  and never 
thought to change it. He was sure 
the Nazis had gutted the files at 
Rech during their slash-and-burn 
retreat to the west. Even if his 
articles still existed somewhere, 
he was convinced they wouldn’t 
affect his new life. 

Through the Tolstoy Founda­
tion, he got a job as a copy editor 
at the Chekhov Publishing House 
in 
Manhattan, 
another 
CIA-
funded operation, which printed 
a hundred or so books by Soviet 
dissidents. Chekhov was meant, 
in the words of its biggest bene­
factor, George Kennan, America’s 
foreign policy sage of the early 
Cold War and one-time Ambassa­
dor to the Soviet Union, to break 
the “monopoly of the Soviet Gov­
ernment on current literary pub­
lication in the Russian language.” 
While at Chekhov, Sokolov 
prepared proofs for several books 
by the Nobel Laureate Ivan Bunin, 
who became a personal hero and a 
model for his own reconstruction. 
In America, he wanted to form 
himself in the image of Bunin, and 
freely admitted it. “I love Bunin as 
an artist, as a true master of words,” 
he wrote in a 1954 letter to the 
playwright Boris Zaitsev. On the 
face of things, they had similar 
stories—sons of the rural gentry, 
who got their starts at newspapers 
in Orel, in Bunin’s case, the local 
daily before the Nazi takeover. 
But the similarity ended there. 
During the war, Bunin had been 
thoroughly 
anti-Nazi. 
At 
his 
home on the French Riviera, 
where he lived throughout the 
German occupation, he shel­
tered Jewish friends and escaped 
Soviet prisoners of war. After the 
war he kept himself out of poli­
tics and kept politics out of his art. 
But Sokolov’s politics couldn’t be 
contained, and he preferred it that 
way. 

In New York, though, his 
career progressed. He impressed 
his superiors at Chekhov, devel­
oping a persona as a fastidious 
reader who could fall into a rage 
at basic grammatical mistakes. He 
befriended Alexandra Tolstoy, a 
lynchpin in the emigré world. He 
wrote editorials for major emigré 
papers, especially the New Russian 
Word. He joined the North Amer­
ican branch of the Coordinating 
Center for the Anti-Bolshevik 
Struggle (later rebranded as an 
NTS chapter) and soon became its 
chairman. He traveled abroad and 
spoke at political conferences. His 
time was in demand.    

In 1954, the prominent Colum­
bia historian Alexander Dallin 
invited him to write a monograph 
for the university’s Research Pro­
gram on the USSR. Sokolov 
accepted the offer. It was his 
chance to write the memoir he 
had been rehearsing in his head for 
over a decade. It was his chance to 
explain everything. He sat down 
with his diaries and scraps of pub­
lished writing he had from the 
war. He called the monograph 
Civilian Life Under German Occu­
pation, 1942-44.   

The project’s stated goal was 
to illustrate the “dilemma con­
fronting Russians in the occupied 
areas who opposed the Bolshe­
vik regime as well as the policy 
of the Germans, but could evolve 
no third force strong enough to 
serve as the vehicle for realizing 
their goals”—a kind of revisiting 
of what the YDN later would call 
Sokolov’s “house of intellectual 
bondage.” The piece was billed 
as journalism, and, for it, Sokolov 
claimed he had interviewed a 
crosshatch of Russians who lived 
through the occupation. The 
source material was meant to serve 
multiple prongs of a single argu­
ment: to prove that true Russians 
hated the Soviets more than they 
hated the Nazis, that many wel­
comed the Nazis as liberators, that 
a small minority of alien (read: 
Jewish) communists had enslaved 
Russia and had to be exorcised, 
and that that same small minority 
posed a more extreme threat than 
the Nazis—in essence, that his 
and others’ collaboration with 
the Nazis was a popular, morally 
sanctioned measure to defeat a

world-historical conspiracy.  

In a ninety-page manuscript 
about the horror visited upon 
civilians 
during 
the 
Second 
World War, he mentions Jews 
four times—all in the context of 
what the Nazi party line was at 
his newspaper—and interviews 
none. His time at the newspaper 
he almost completely elides, aside 
from a scene at the town hall, in 
which 
German-appointed 
mayor of Orel tells him that the 
Nazis are essentially non-offen­
sive busybodies, and begs him 
to work for Rech as a holy obli­
gation to the city: “Help us, help 
us protect our people,” the mayor 
tells him. (While on trial decades 
later, Sokolov admitted the whole 
scene was fictional; when he met 
the mayor for the first time, he 
said, he had already been work­
ing at the paper.) Now out of his 
“house of intellectual bondage” 
and at Columbia, Sokolov was 
writing a more coded version of 
the Judeo-Bolshevik myth. In it, 
he cast the Nazis as banal manag­
ers who were half as brutal as the 
Soviets, whose genocide didn’t 
merit comment, and with whom 
collaboration was both righteous 
and non-ideological. 

Later that year, a Russian emi­
gré, who claimed to be an old 
acquaintance from Orel, read 
what Sokolov had written, and 
told the American Immigration 
and Naturalization Service (INS) 
that they had let a Nazi collabo­
rator slip into the country. INS 
brought Sokolov in for an inter­
view, and again he repeated the 
lines he knew by heart: he was an 
anti-communist, he never served 
in the Red Army or any army 
because of a heart condition, he 
had been a proofreader at a Rus­
sian language paper in occupied 
territory.          

After INS released Sokolov, the 
FBI took an interest in him. One 
FBI informant reported back, 
following a brief inquiry in the 
days after the INS interview, that 
Sokolov was a “burning anti-com­
munist.” Field reports declassi­
fied under the Nazi War Crimes 
Disclosure Act of 1998 show that 
this assessment was enough for the 
FBI to make contact with Sokolov 
in September 1954. They wanted 
him to give them information 
on another anti-communist emi­
gré whom Sokolov had met on 
a few occasions and whom the 
FBI suspected was susceptible to 
Soviet blackmail. In April 1959, 
Richard Bissell, Jr., the Deputy 
Director of Plans of the CIA, gave 
J. Edgar Hoover, the Director of 
the FBI, the all-clear to interview 
Sokolov about his willingness to 
inform, in an official capacity, on 
potential Soviet infiltration in his 
New York branch of NTS, whose 
global offices, at the time, received 
CIA backing.  

Here the trail gets somewhat 
murky. After the April 1959 mem­
orandum from Bissell, no other 
declassified documents appear in 
Sokolov’s file until 1980, soon 
after the Justice Department began 
its investigation of him, and even 
those have been redacted. Sokolov 
may have interviewed well, been 
on-boarded, 
and 
assigned 
an 
FBI informant ID soon after, 
accounting for the sudden drop-
off in internal docs mentioning 
his name. He may also have been 
insulted by the suggestion that his 
organization would ever harbor 
communists and refused the offer. 
But doing so would have raised 
suspicion about his own sympa­
thies—something Sokolov had a 
talent for avoiding—and having 
the FBI’s blessing would have alle­
viated the burden of proving his 
allegiances were genuine.

Norman J.W. Goda, a scholar 
of the Holocaust at the University 
of Florida, was one of four histo­
rians commissioned by Congress 
in 2000 to examine the millions 
of pages of declassified documents 
on the U.S. intelligence appara­
tus’s recruitment of ex-Nazis, and 
write a report on their contents. 
He wrote that the 1959 memo­
randum may have been the begin­
ning of Sokolov’s stint as an FBI 
informant at Yale—at the time, 
a hotbed of intelligence recruit­
ment and Cold Warrior training. 
“Clearly the FBI protected him,” 
Goda told me. “I don’t know how 
he got his position at Yale. I pos­
ited that the FBI might have had 
some kind of role in that, but I 
really don’t know. And I said that 
perhaps the FBI was using him as 
some sort of source on Yale, but 
I really didn’t know that either. I 
was just sort of guessing. It didn’t 
make sense. He was a Russian Lit 
person, but he really didn’t have 
any credentials. It didn’t make 
sense to me why Yale would hire 
him.” 

FBI informant or not, Sokolov 
was hired by Yale for his politics 
and the kind of ideological train­
ing he could provide. He landed 
on the university’s radar thanks 
to Vladimir Petrov, a lecturer in 
the department who had taught 
Russian there since its inception. 
Petrov was the one who recom­
mended him for an interview in 
1959, something that required an 
almost irrational confidence in 
Sokolov’s political reliability. In 
the world of emigré anticommu­
nism, anyone could turn out to 
be a Soviet spy and any unlucky 
believer could be browbeaten by 
kompromat. Any recommenda­
tion, especially one for a position 
as a teacher of the next generation 
of American diplomats and spies, 
came at grave personal risk.

But Petrov had more than faith 
to go on: he had the same connec­
tions as Sokolov. When Sokolov 
was writing editorials for a Nazi 
paper tied to the Russian mon­
archist Andrey Vlasov, Petrov 
was arranging meetings between 
Vlasov and high-up Nazi gener­
als to coordinate military strategy 
for overthrowing the Bolsheviks. 
When Sokolov came to the U.S., 
he found employment through 
the Tolstoy Foundation, and so 
did Petrov. Both wrote memoirs 
about their experiences of com­
munism that doubled as salvos. 
And both contributed often to the 
emigré press. 

In 1959, there was a vacancy 
in the department. Petrov’s rec­
ommendation of Sokolov to fill it 
carried weight. William Cornyn, 
the chairman at the time, was 
out of town, and asked Schenker, 
the professor who would become 
Sokolov’s most vigorous advocate 
after others in the department 
repudiated him, to interview him 
in his place. They met in New 
York and talked credentials, pol­
itics, Europe, and family. They 
hit it off. Sokolov was hired that 
summer. 

Seven years into Sokolov’s 
tenure at Yale, he paid Petrov’s 
favor forward. In 1966, he recom­
mended the department interview 
Rurik Dudin, a close friend from 
the NTS and a broadcaster at the 
radio program Voice of America. 
He was hired shortly after. Dudin 
was another good teacher—char­
ismatic and funny. He had also 
been an ex-soldier in the youth 
division of a Nazi paramilitary 
made up of Russian volunteers. 
Edward Stankiewicz, a full pro­
fessor in the Russian department, 
survived the Nazi concentration 
camp Buchenwald. Emmanuel 
Sztein, a lecturer, lost fifty-two 
family members in Auschwitz. In 
the mid-ninteen-sixties, during 
a wave of state-sponsored antise­mi­
tic repressions in Poland, he 
was forced, while being tortured 
in prison, to share a cell with the 
Nazis’ former territorial governor 
of the region. At Yale, Dudin, 
Petrov, and Sokolov were the col­
leagues they had to make small 
talk with by the doors to the Hall 
of Graduate Studies. 

V.
In November 1985, Sokolov, 
now 72, sat in the Federal District 
Court for the District of Connecti­
cut, at the Post Office Building in 
Waterbury, flanked by an inter­
preter and his defense attorneys, 
Brian Gildea and Kevin Smith. 
The defense had been approved 
for a trial by judge, who in this 
case was something of a celebrity 
on the legal circuit: Thomas F. 
Murphy, formerly the chief pros­
ecutor on the Alger Hiss trial. No 
jury was present in Waterbury, 
and the room seemed somewhat 
empty for it. The government 
sent three lawyers from the Office 
of Special Investigations (OSI) at 
the Department of Justice—two 
trial attorneys, Bruce Einhorn 
and Aron Goldberg, and Joseph 
Lynch, an Assistant U.S. Attorney, 
ex-NYPD detective, and the lead 
prosecutor on the case. 

OSI began in the mid-1970s as a 
preliminary list of suspected Nazis 
living in the U.S. and evolved, 
by 1979, into a task force of over 
thirty lawyers, historians, forensic 
specialists, and translators with a 
$2.3 million budget. Its mission 
was to prosecute ex-Nazis in the 
U.S., not as war criminals, but for 
lying to immigration officials and 
illegally obtaining American citi­
zenship. A guilty sentence meant 
denaturalization 
deporta­
tion—not prison or death, like 
Nuremberg—and the script each 
complaint followed was similar. 
In Sokolov’s case, the government 
set out to prove that he had 1) 
concealed past advocacy of per­
secution to his interviewer at the 
Displaced Persons camp where he 
applied for a visa; 2) voluntarily 
assisted an enemy combatant of 
the U.S.; 3) misrepresented his 
background—the 
“proofreader” 
falsehood—to gain entry into the 
U.S.; and 4) procured citizenship 
despite a “lack of moral charac­
ter.” “It’s a high burden of proof 
to revoke citizenship—as it should 
be,” Allan Ryan, Director of OSI 
at the time the initial complaint 
was filed, told me. The Office filed 
suit in January 1982. 

Trials typically began with tes­
timony from Holocaust histori­
ans, explaining how one figure fit 
into the complex machinery of the 
Nazi genocide. Robert Herzstein, 
whose research later helped OSI 
uncover that Kurt Waldheim, for­
mer Secretary General of the UN 
and then the sitting President of 
Austria, had been a Nazi paramili­
tary soldier, testified at the start of 
Sokolov’s trial. Sokolov’s role in 
the Nazi apparatus was to ensure 
that it grew, Herzstein said, to 
wage “ideological and psycholog­
ical warfare” on its behalf, and to 
Together, Sokolov’s words constituted a 
worldview he could justify and weapon­
ize—and later deny he ever had.
