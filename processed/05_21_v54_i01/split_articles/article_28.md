Nearly every student and pro­
fessor at Yale Law School assumed 
that fellow Yalie Hillary Clinton 
LAW ’73 would coast to an easy 
electoral victory in the fall of 
2016. In the weeks and months 
following Trump’s surprise upset, 
feverish conversations about what 
the election meant for the future 
of the country—and especially for 
the future of the legal profession—
spilled out of student apartments, 
bars, and other gathering spaces 
around New Haven, into lecture 
halls and seminar rooms at the law 
school, and back out again. 


Yale, like much of America, 
was in a state of shock. 


The election spurred a wave 
of student organizing at the 
law school, much of it focused 
on resisting the immediate 
threat Trump posed to vul­
nerable communities around 
the world. That January, for 
example, a group of law stu­
dents in Yale’s Worker and 
Immigrant 
Rights 
Advo­
cacy Clinic (WIRAC) made 
national headlines for its role 
in challenging Trump’s Mus­
lim ban and staunching the 
flow of deportations. But for a 
smaller group of left-wing law 
students (many of whom were also 
involved in the immediate wave 
of organizing), Trump’s election 
demanded a longer view of things. 
“The feeling was that while 
Trump would be a four or eight-
year President, Trumpism was a 
longer-term phenomenon, and 
the need to have a very thoughtful 
and coherent response to that—and 
not just a political response but a 
new intellectual framework for 
rethinking the law and rethinking 
policy—seemed extremely urgent 
at that time,” remembers Adam 
Bradlow LAW ’18. 


The beginnings of that frame­
work came together ten days 
after the election, at eight in the 
morning on Friday, November 
18. Professor Amy Kapczynski, 
whose work focuses on intellec­
tual property and health justice, 
convened a group of five students 
in her office. The students—Nick 
Werle LAW ’17, Conor Reynolds 
LAW ’17, Lina Khan LAW ’17, 
Solange Hilfinger-Pardo LAW 
’17, along with Bradlow—knew 
Kapczynksi and each other well 
from previous political and aca­
demic work at the law school. In 
the weeks before the election, a 
few of them had been planning a 
future conference on how to push 
a would-be Clinton administra­
tion to the left on economic pol­
icy.


In the meeting at Kapczynski’s 
office, the group talked about how 
Clinton’s loss represented what 
Werle described as “the failure of 
the Democratic Party and the left 
more broadly” to appeal to work­
ing people after decades of wage 
stagnation and spiralling inequal­
ity. They talked about the rise of 
the conservative legal movement, 
which had steadily shifted many

legal fields to the right over the 
past half-century. And they talked 
about how they felt their legal edu­
cation had left them ill-equipped 
to grapple with the longstanding 
social, political, and legal struc­
tures—from the evaporation of 
union jobs, to the corporate cap­
ture of the political process, to the 
persistence of racialized violence 
against nonwhite people—that had 
made Trump an attractive candi­
date to tens of millions of Amer­
icans. 


At the core of the group’s frus­
tration was their feeling that their 
legal 
training 
consistently 
separated economic questions 
(how markets are structured 
and 
resources 
distributed) 
from political ones (who 
holds power and how they 
wield it). Trump—the lout­
ish heir to a real estate for­
tune who exploited America’s 
business-friendly bankruptcy 
laws, defrauded its threadbare 
tax code, and stiffed undocu­
mented workers on his way 
to the presidency—perfectly 
encapsulated their interest in 
the intertwining of economic 
and political power, and the 
role of law in mediating both. 


Toward the end of the 
meeting, Kapczynski asked the 
group how she could be of use to 
them. After some discussion, they 
decided they wanted to create an 
entirely new course—it was their 
education, after all, that they’d 
found wanting. Werle suggested 
they frame the class around the 
concept of “political economy,” 
an intellectual tradition with roots 
in the eighteenth and nineteeth 
centuries that interrogates how 
the economy is shaped by poli­
tics and vice versa. For “political 
economists” in the classical sense, 
like Karl Marx and Adam Smith, 
the economy is inherently politi­

cal, both in its origins and in its 
effects. It was exactly the kind of 
framework the group was look­
ing for. 


And thus the “Law and Politi­
cal Economy” seminar was born. 
“I was super excited,” said 
Werle, who called his dad right 
after the meeting to tell him 
how, even in its early days, he felt 
the idea of a course on political 
economy “had the potential to 
be far-reaching.” Reflecting on 
that moment—and everything 
that followed it—almost five 
years later, Werle said the seed 
he helped plant in Kapczyn­
ski’s office that November had 
blossomed 
into 
something 
greater than he ever could 
have imagined. 


II.
On the evening of Janu­
ary 19th—the first day of the 
class—Kapczynski asked each 
of the seventeen students, 
most of whom were enter­
ing their final semester of law 
school, to explain why they’d 
decided to join. 


“The sort of answers peo­
ple were giving were that 
they wanted to understand 
where legal thought had fallen 
short, and that they wanted to 
be the generation that makes 
a difference, not only in terms 
of providing a framework that 
accounts for political economy 
in legal thought but also in terms 
of advancing policies and prior­
ities that addressed some of the 
glaring injustices that we were 
seeing in our country,” Bradlow 
remembers. 


That the students had a broadly 
similar set of reasons for taking 
the class was not a coincidence. 
Like the smaller group that ini­
tially 
approached 
Kapczynski, 
the students in “Law and Political 
Economy” had frequently crossed 
paths at Yale. 


Two years earlier, several of the 
students in the class ran a success­
ful left-wing campaign in a con­
tentious election for the board of 
Yale’s American Constitutional 
Society chapter, which represents 
its 
progressive 
law 
students. 
Their campaign had criticized the 
ostensibly progressive society’s 
careerism and chummy relation­
ship with the Democratic Party 
establishment. Will Bloom LAW 
’17 sardonically remembered hav­
ing run on “a platform of ‘We’re 
not going to bring Tim fucking 
Geithner’”—Obama’s 
Treasury 
secretary, who had orchestrated 
the bank bailouts during the Great 
Recession—“‘to Yale Law School 
anymore.’” 


Many 
were 
also 
involved in WIRAC and other 
clinical work, and a few had been 
part of reading groups on Law 
and Neoliberalism and Michel 
Foucault’s The Birth of Biopolitics. 
A handful had also been involved 
in supporting Yale’s grad stu­
dent union campaign, which had 
reached a fever pitch that August 
after the National Labor Relations 
Board ruled that graduate students 
at private universities had the 
right to unionize. The group—and 
especially its 3L students, whose 
time at Yale was bookended by 
the 2014 police killing of Michael 
Brown and the insurgent cam­
paigns of Donald Trump and 
Bernie Sanders—represented the 
“cohering of some left-wing force 
in the law school,” said Bloom. 


They “wanted something beyond 
the bounds of what you can usu­
ally find” in the gilded halls of 127 
Wall Street. 


“We all kind of agreed that 
the system was broken, that 
the ownership class had out­
sized power in our political 
system and that was influ­
encing the way the law was 
structured,” Bloom added. 


“Having all of that out of the 
way as the set terms of dis­
cussion meant that we could 
actually have very fascinating 
conversations.” 


From 
mid-January 
to 
early April, the group met 
each Thursday evening in 
a cramped seminar room 
in the basement of the law 
school. Sometimes they’d go 
out together for drinks after. 


The late meeting time, combined 
with the subject matter and the 
fact that much of the syllabus 
came together in real time, lent 
each session a frisson of subver­
sive energy. “It almost felt under­
ground,” Reynolds recalled. “Or 
as far underground as you can be 
in Yale Law School’s fancy build­
ing.” 


They began the course by read­
ing Karl Polanyi, a twentieth cen­
tury Hungarian political econ­
omist whose most well-known 
argument—that the economy is 
not a self-regulating machine that

follows its own rules, but rather is 
embedded in non-economic insti­
tutions, including the legal sys­
tem—became “an essential orga­
nizing principle” of the course, 
Werle said. The next weeks cov­
ered constitutional law, racial jus­
tice, trade, incarceration, labor, 
environmental law, antitrust, and 
human rights, with each class 
focused on how the specific area 
of law could be moved in a more 
democratic and egalitarian direc­
tion. Most weeks, one or two stu­
dents volunteered to lead the class 
discussion. (Just over four years 
after Lina Khan led the course’s 
session on anti-trust law, she was 
named by President Biden as 
chairwoman of the Federal Trade 
Commission, a decision hailed by 
progressives as auguring a new era 
of trust-busting.)


“It was the best class I’ve taken 
in my life—best in law school, best 
period,” reflected Brian Highsmith 
LAW ’17. “And I think we all felt 
that there was an urgency there, 
where this perspective is so sorely 
missing from our law school cur­
ricula. We all realized toward the 
end of the class that there was 
something here that needed to be 
explored further, but we didn’t 
know exactly what form that 
would take.”


III.
As spring gave way to summer, 
the group gathered one last time 
around a seminar table to figure 
out how they might continue the 
momentum the course had gen­
erated. They considered initiat­
ing LPE-inspired service projects 
or starting a regular LPE reading 
group, but both proposals felt 
too insular. They wanted to see 
whether their ideas would reso­
nate outside of Yale’s cloistered 
walls. Ultimately, they settled on 
continuing the course’s mission 
in what Kate Redburn LAW ’19 
called “the most Web 2.0 way 
ever.” They started a blog. 


As the class scattered across the 
country for summer internships, 
clerkships, and first jobs, Redburn, 
Werle, and Bradlow took the 
lead. Kapczynski invited David 
Grewal LAW ’02 and Jed Purdy 
LAW ’01, then law professors at 
Yale and Duke, respectively, to 
be co-founders of the blog (they’d 
both been guest speakers in the 
class). Building the blog became a 
particular obsession for Redburn, 
who suffered a herniated disc at 
the end of the summer, causing 
them to withdraw from Yale for 
the semester. “I was just lying on 
my back with this contraption that 
had my iPad hanging over my 
face,” Redburn said. “Working on 
the blog was the only thing pre­
venting me from losing my mind.” 


In October, the blog made its 
debut with a quasi-manifesto, 
written by Purdy, Grewal, and 
Kapczynski. “This is a time of cri­
ses,” the co-founders began, sit­
uating the blog in the context of 
accelerating inequality and wealth 
concentration, the climate emer­
gency, and the rise of authoritar­
ian political movements around 
the world. But it was also, they 
noted, a time of enhanced pos­
sibility. A new generation of left 
movements, from Occupy and the 
Fight for 15 to the Movement for 
Black Lives and #Not1More, was 
“challenging economic inequality, 
eroded democracy, the carceral 
state, and racism, sexism, and 
other forms of discrimination with 
a force that was unthinkable just a 
few years ago.” 


Their choice to frame the blog 
in generational terms wasn’t a 
coincidence. Purdy, Grewal, and 
Kapczynski were around the same 
age and all had gone to Yale Law 
at the turn of the millennium. 
Their political consciences were 
forged in the miasma of what 
Purdy called “the Long 1990s,” 
a moment when the Clinton 
administration’s embrace of aus­
terity gave a bipartisan gloss to 
the Thatcherite dictum that “there 
is no alternative” to neoliberal 
capitalism. Nearly everywhere 
you looked, Purdy reflected, you 
encountered “the idea that mar­
kets were not only the most viable 
form of social organization but 
that they were basically compat­
ible with democracy—and indeed 
that liberal democracy basically 
meant market democracy... and 
that anything that would stand in 
the way of this trajectory was sort 
of churlish or reactionary or irra­
tional.” By the time they arrived 
in law school, transformative 
change no longer appeared on the 
horizon.  


The blog signaled that things 
changing. 
Kapczynski 
remembered its early days as 
shaped by an “ethos of students 
and faculty thinking together, 
and trying to figure out what 
the old frameworks we as faculty 
were taught as students and come 
to from our political culture, 
and what’s wrong and missing.” 


Among many other subjects, they 
published pieces that first year 
on the anti-capitalist racial jus­
tice politics of the Movement for 
Black Lives, the structural vio­
lence of Uber and Lyft, and the 
political economy of freedom of 
speech.  


“I was just blown away that 
LPE existed,” said John Whitlow, 
a law professor at CUNY and 
former tenant lawyer who started 
writing for the blog that spring. 
“As soon as I saw it, I recognized 
that it filled a lack that had existed 
in the legal academy that was 
much more profound than I had
