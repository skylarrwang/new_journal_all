F
or seventeen long years, 
from 1959 to 1976, Vladimir 
Sokolov had been a respect­
ed, well-liked Senior Lec­
turer in Russian at Yale. He was a 
skilled teacher, reserved, revealed 
little of himself, and students and 
colleagues knew not to ask him 
about his life in Russia during the 
Second World War. In conver­
sation, his story was skeletal: he 
came of age under Stalin’s purges, 
fled as a political refugee, eluded 
death too many times to recount.  
But in the nineteen-seventies, 
a part of Sokolov’s past that he 
had concealed for three decades 
flooded his present. By 1985, 
he was facing death threats and 
imminent deportation from the 
United States. Sokolov wasn’t the 
dissident he insisted he was. He 
had been a Nazi.

The threads began to unravel 
in February 1976. A short article 
appeared in the daily newspaper 
of the Soviet Communist Par­
ty’s Youth League, alleging that 
a Russian professor at Yale had 
written propaganda for the Nazis 
during their assault on the East­
ern Front. Then a longer piece 
was published a couple of months 
later in a Soviet Yiddish magazine 
describing that professor’s war­
time actions. Sokolov, the author 
wrote, had been the deputy edi­
tor-in-chief of a Nazi-controlled 
newspaper in the Russian border­
lands, pumping out exhortations 
to genocide. 

In May 1976, Sid Resnick, a 
New Haven-based writer for the 
Morgen Freiheit, a large commu­
nist Yiddish daily in New York, 
sent a translation of the article, 
along with photocopies of the 
original pieces it referenced, to 
Robert Jackson, then-chairman of 
Yale’s Slavic Languages and Lit­
eratures department.

Twice 
before, 
the 
depart­
ment had been tipped off about 
Sokolov’s Nazi history by anony­
mous sources in the Soviet Union. 
Both times, the faculty met behind 
closed doors and asked Sokolov to 
explain himself. In both cases, he 
convinced them that he was being 
smeared. The KGB hated him for 
his anticommunism, his writing 
in the emigré press, his work at 
the university; they had declared 
him guilty of outlandish atroci­
ties to discredit his activism. The 
department dropped the inquiry, 
and Sokolov stayed on the fac­
ulty. The tips stopped coming. 
But now Jackson had pages of 
Sokolov’s broadsides in the Nazi 
newspaper Rech on his desk, and 
he couldn’t look away. What he 
saw was “Goebbels-like,” he told 
the Nazi hunter and journalist 
Charles R. Allen, Jr., who was 
reporting on the Sokolov affair 
for 
progressive 
quarterly 
Jewish Currents. “In this strug­
gle, Zhidostva [the Kikes] will 
be destroyed finally and forever,” 
one of them read. In another, 
he told readers, “For twenty five 
years, the Zhids [Kikes] hit us, 
for twenty-five years, the zhids 
[kikes] tormented and ripped 
pieces from the Russian people. 
Finished! Never again will their 
foot trod upon our soil. And there 
where they continue to torture 
the people, there will sooner or 
later be an outcry: ‘Beat them!’”

The 
documents 
circulated 
around the department that sum­
mer, and a third meeting was 
called between faculty in the 
department; 
Jackson; 
Horace 
Taft, the Dean of the College; 
Jarislov Pelikan, the Dean of the 
Graduate School; Hanna Gray, 
the Provost; and Sokolov. The 
articles weren’t Soviet forgeries, 
Sokolov said this time, but he’d 
been coerced into writing them 
under penalty of death. 

Who forced him to join the paper 
to begin with? He had to survive. 
He had to feed his family. Did 
he have to urge people to slaughter 
innocents? Did he have to call Jews 
“yellow rats?” He had been ill. He 
couldn’t work in the mines or the 
forests. He had to write. He wrote 
what the Nazis told him to. Did 
he believe what he wrote? He only 
wanted to write against the Bol­
sheviks. The censor twisted his 
words. But when pressed for con­
crete examples of edits from the 
censor, Sokolov could only give 
one: All his references to “Jews” 
had been changed to “zhids,” the 
Russian equivalent of “kike.”      

That was enough for four 
professors in the department—
Carol Anschuetz, Victor Erlich, 
Riccardo Picchio, and Edward 
Stankiewicz—to 
draw 
a 
line 
in the sand. In late June, a few 
weeks after the meeting, they 
wrote an open letter to Sokolov, 
saying that he could “under no 
circumstances...count 
on 
undersigned for any support 
whatsoever.” They sent the letter 
knowing that the university had 
already decided what it intended 
to do with him, which amounted, 
in essence, to whatever Sokolov 
wanted to do with himself. He 
was 63, two years shy of retire­
ment, and, on the books, hadn’t 
done anything to violate his con­
tract. As an institutional matter, 
the university said its hands were 
tied. 

Provost Gray met with Sokolov 
alone that summer. He was incon­
solable, she recalled in her mem­
oirs, “an aging and seemingly 
broken man who felt that he was

about to lose everything, and was 
desperately concerned about what 
would become of his family.” She 
promised that Yale wouldn’t force 
him out. He chose to resign and 
received a full year’s salary as sev­
erance, plus funds from a TIAA 
pension he and Yale had contrib­
uted to over the years. 

Meanwhile, Jackson went wad­
ing through the department’s 
records to try to understand how 
Sokolov had been hired in the first 
place and to study his track record 
on the faculty. He interviewed 
former students and colleagues 
Sokolov socialized with, some of 
whom said that his gentle persona 
was an act that occasionally got 
sloppy. “We knew many things 
about him from students,” Jack­
son, now 98 and nearing 20 years 
emeritus, told me. “We knew 
that he was rather outspoken 
with those students. One of them 
informed me that he said he had 
‘dogs who can smell out Jews.’” 

Using the department’s internal 
documents and what he’d gathered 
from interviews, Jackson wrote up 
an 11-page account of Sokolov’s 
time at Yale, which has since, it 
seems, been lost. “I had studied his 
background,” he told me, “how he 
used it to bring other people into 
the department with similar ideas 
as his own, vicious anti-Semitic 
ideas. I gave this account to the 
Provost at a meeting of her staff, 
and she cast the whole thing aside 
rather haughtily.” Jackson thought 
about publishing what he’d writ­
ten, then thought better of it. “I 
played a role as a spokesman of the 
department. At the time, I thought 
it would have upset the apple cart,” 
he said. But the case, and what it 
meant for the department, stuck 
with him. When the dust had set­
tled, he went back to look through 
the department’s in-house files on 
Sokolov, the ones he’d extensively 
sourced from for his probe. They 
had vanished.

Alexander Schenker, ex-chair­
man of the Russian department 
and one of Sokolov’s closest allies 
on the faculty, had been on leave 
as the crisis around Sokolov deep­
ened that summer. When Schen­
ker got back to campus before 
the fall term, Sokolov had already 
resigned, and he was “outraged” 
by the department’s handling of 
the case, according to Jackson. 
Schenker, a Polish-Jewish emi­
gré who fled Krakow for Russia 
as a teenager amidst the Nazis’ 
advance, and had been sent to a 
labor camp with his mother, kept 
a lifelong hatred of the Soviets and 
charged that the department had 
indulged in a witch hunt. 

Weeks later, at the start of the 
semester, the Yale Daily News 
picked up the story of Sokolov’s 
resignation and sought Schenk­
er’s comment. “Here you have 
a man who had suffered during 
those years, who has been arrested, 
who has risked going to concen­
tration camps,” he told John Har­
ris ’78 at the News. “The German 
occupation, paradoxical as it may 
seem, was the only real chance to 
escape.” Sokolov, he continued, 
“believed that the temporary evil 
of Hitler, who was bound to be 
defeated by the West, was better 
than the Russians. People have a 
right to change. He is not anti-Se­
mitic now. In fact, he is probably 
the most pro-Semitic Russian in 
the department… The question 
is, do we recognize redemption or 
not?” 

The article set off a months-
long debate in the News’s opinion 
section. First, in September 1976, 
the editors of the News published 
an editorial defending Sokolov on 
the grounds of academic freedom 
and good behavior. “Although 
we are somewhat alarmed by the 
vast ideological distance one man 
can travel in 30 years,” the Board 
wrote that it was inclined to trust 
Sokolov when he said that “he is 
no longer anti-Semitic and that he 
‘loves his students.’” “The lesson 
is simple,” they wrote, “all men 
grow when they leave the house 
of intellectual bondage.” The 
same day, the scandal breached the 
national news orbit under a loud 
New York Times header: “YALE 
TEACHER QUITS OVER PRO-
NAZI ROLE.” 

Throughout the week, let­
ters streamed into the News from 
professors, students, and alums, 
some castigating, others praising 
the editorial. Sokolov’s defenders 
repeated a variation of Schenk­
er’s character reference: he had 
been a helpful and kind teacher, 
a “pro-Semite,” a Zionist, who at 
the time never knew of the Nazi 
genocide, who had been caught in 
a Soviet plot, framed with coun­
terfeits, framed as a personal ven­
detta, framed in order to delegit­
imize emigré dissent, Yale, and 
the U.S., whose present redeemed 
his past, whose past couldn’t be 
judged through a contemporary 
moral lens from a “New Haven 
armchair,” and, even if it could, 
whose speech was coerced and 
wasn’t, in itself, so bad, or was 
edited by the censor, or was writ­
ten by a boss, or was conscious, 
but for calculated and politically 
respectable reasons, or was a last 
resort to live. Alexandra Tolstoy, 
daughter of Leo and then-chair of 
the Tolstoy Foundation, a reset­
tlement organization for Russian 
refugees, was one of several prom­
inent figures to publicly vouch for 
Sokolov in the News.

part, said that his advocacy of 
genocide was willfully undertaken 
out of conviction and expedience, 
and bore an absolute immoral­
ity; that however he presented 
himself now was irrelevant to his 
crimes, that there had been other 
ways of surviving the war, that 
he was a chameleon; that a seeth­
ing antisemitism was a part of his 
sense of self, which left him pri­
vately raging, even at Yale, that he 
was under Jewish domination.   

Finally, 
Sokolov 
spoke 
himself in a letter to the YDN. 
Writing against the Bolsheviks, 
whatever the venue, had been 
his “sacred duty,” he wrote, and 
the Nazi press ended up being 
the only venue. The Nazis made 
him inflect his anti-Bolshevism 
with anti-Semitism, and he only 
wrote against Jews in power, he 
insisted, in “key positions in the 
party appartus.” By the time he 
was writing, there were no Jews 
left in the area, and it wasn’t until 
after the war that he learned of 
their “tragic fate.” And after the 
“Doctors’ Plot”—a 1953 Stalinist 
campaign animated by a lie that 
nine prominent doctors, six of 
whom were Jewish, had planned a 
mass-poisoning of the Soviet lead­
ership—Sokolov wrote that, at the 
time, he had told himself: “From 
now on the Jews have become 
allies in the struggle against our 
common 
enemy—Communism. 
The enemy of my enemy is my 
friend.” 

Friends 
and 
enemies. 
This 
was the activating principle of 
Sokolov’s life. You were either an 
instrument of or an obstacle to his 
future, deserving acceptance on 
the one hand, annihilation on the 
other. And when he held the tools 
of annihilation, he used them to 
devastating effect. 

II.
The city’s name was Orel. At 
the turn of the 20th century, it 
was home to about 75,000 peo­
ple, mostly farmers who worked 
the land and nobles who owned 
it. It was situated deep in “wooden 
Russia,” the agricultural heartland 
200 miles south of Moscow, and 
its main export was grain, huge 
amounts of it: both to feed the 
Empire and to sell abroad. It was 
laid out the way Russia’s agrar­
ian towns typically were—radial 
streets spiraling outward from a 
central market, ploughlands on 
the outskirts, deep birch forest 
beyond. 

Sokolov was born in Orel in 
1913 into a world that was about 
to be destroyed. His father, active 
in local politics, was a nobleman, 
a lawyer, and a landlord. His 
mother, the daughter of the Rec­
tor of the city’s theological semi­
nary, taught Russian literature at a 
local school. He and his younger 
brother were homeschooled until 
age nine, which, as he would later 
recount in an essay on the Soviet 
education system, was “customary 
in the families of the intelligentsia 
in those years.”  

Even before Sokolov was born, 
the area showed signs of a loom­
ing crisis, and the nobility was 
anxious. The price of grain was 
plummeting and the land tax was 
high. Peasants were swimming in 
debt. Famine had set in. The Tsar’s 
ministers warned him in the early 
1890s that his hold on the region 
was slipping away. So the gov­
ernment built railroads—by 1895, 
22,000 miles of track. They were 
meant to help the cities industri­
alize fast, a trick borrowed from 
America and Prussia. It worked. 
With the industrial setting came 
an industrial proletariat, a new 
intellectual class, an immiserated 
peasantry, and enormous private 
wealth. Contradiction meant cri­
sis. 

By mid-1905, the empire was 
in the throes of its first revolution, 
and rioting paralyzed the cities. 
That winter, Orel had its own 
night of mayhem. In the Tsar’s 
newspapers, the revolution was 
labeled a Jewish plot. The charge 
was meant to quarantine the spread 
of Bolshevism by association with 
Jewry, to whet the mob’s appetite 
for broken glass and blood. Orel 
had a relatively large Jewish pop­
ulation for a city outside the Pale 
of Settlement—about 2,000 at the 
time—and on October 18th, 1905, 
hundreds of the city’s Jews were

This was the activating principle of 
Sokolov’s life. You were either an in­
strument of or an obstacle to his future, 
deserving acceptance on the one hand, 
annihilation on the other. And when he 
held the tools of annihilation, he used 
them to devastating effect.
