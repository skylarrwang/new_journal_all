his mother, have been motivated 
more explicitly by prejudice. 
In addition to hostile police 
interactions, people living on the 
streets are vulnerable to theft, 
sexual assault, and the weather. 
Despite the instability of this life, 
many unhoused people choose 
to live outdoors rather than in 
a shelter. Cadwell once stayed 
in Emergency Shelter Manage­
ment Services, a notoriously der­
elict establishment known as the 
“Grand Avenue Shelter.” The 
shelter houses seventy-five people 
in a room with rows and rows of 
orange-blanketed cots. As docu­
mented in the New Haven Inde­
pendent, the shelter operates within 
a one-story building that garnered 
multiple allegations of mold and 
fleas around when Cadwell lived 
there between 2014 and 2017. In 
theory, no one is allowed to be 
intoxicated at the Grand Avenue 
Shelter, but according to Cad­
well, that wasn’t the case when he 
stayed there five years ago. Cad­
well himself is addicted to crack 
cocaine. Still, the atmosphere 
bothered him. The shelter was 
“the nastiest place I think I’ve ever 
been in my life,” he said. “I got 
disgusted.” He decided to leave, 
and eventually found his spot by 
the railroad, under the bridge.
The shelter system does not fit 
the needs of everyone without 
a permanent place to live. Most 
homeless shelters for single adults, 
like Grand Avenue, are commu­
nal spaces that offer little oppor­
tunity for solitude. They are also 
intensely regulated. Shelters gen­
erally check for drugs and alcohol 
at the door, and some perform 
drug tests on clients, compounding 
the difficulties of finding a place to 
sleep for people living with addic­
tion. They impose stringent cur­
fews and often close down during 
the daytime, requiring residents to 
enter and leave according to a uni­
form and preset schedule. Many 
shelters limit the amount of consec­
utive days that a client is allowed to 
sleep there.
“We don’t acknowledge the fact 
that there is a whole subset of peo­
ple who are homeless that either 
cannot or will not comply with 
the rules of a shelter,” said Mark 
Colville, a white-haired homeless 
rights’ activist with a full-throated 
voice. Colville co-runs the Amis­
tad Catholic Worker house on the 
Hill’s Rosette Street, which offers 
food and other resources for those 
living in poverty. “What you do 
when you walk into a shelter is the 
same thing you do when you walk 
into a jail,” Colville said. “You give 
up your freedom, you give up your 
privacy, and most importantly, you 
give up your agency.” 


When the COVID-19 pandemic 
arrived in New Haven in March 
2020, the city’s homeless shelters 
underwent a radical change. At first, 
they turned more and more people 
away, in an effort to “de-densify” 
and enable social distancing. As 
public health officials urged resi­
dents to “shelter-in-place,” those 
without a place in which to shelter 
heard no answers about where they 
could go.
By then, all the tourists had aban­
doned town, leaving the city full 
of empty guest rooms. So the city’s 
Community Services Department 
decided to rent newfound space 
from a handful of local hotels and 
motels to serve as expansion sites for 
shelters. Shelter clients relocated, 
two to a room, to establishments

mostly on the outskirts of the city, 
like Best Western and the Regal 
Inn. 
Just under a year after the pro­
gram’s start in March 2020, some 
people were still waiting for a hotel 
room. Jeff, who decided to share 
only his first name, was living out­
doors in March 2021—“here and 
there,” as he put it. He wanted, 
more than anything, to find a place 
to stay inside. When he first heard 
rumors that the city of New Haven 
was going to open up hotel rooms 
for unhoused city residents during 
the pandemic, he didn’t believe it. 
“Like, really, you’re gonna give me 
a hotel room?” he recalled thinking. 
“It just seemed too good to be true.”
For many homeless individu­
als in the city, including Cadwell, 
the promise of a hotel room took 
months to materialize. Jeff managed 
to get on the waitlist for a hotel 
room in December of 2020. Three 
months later, he had still not secured 
one. 
Emmett, a 50-year-old event pro­
ducer-turned-filmmaker who asked 
to use a pseudonym, had been all 
right with sleeping outdoors in an 
encampment for most of the pan­
demic—until the cold came. As 
winter crept over New Haven, he 
accumulated piles and piles of blan­
kets inside his tent, but still shivered 
at night. While Emmett heard that 
every hotel room was full in Decem­
ber, rumors trickled throughout 
the city that the hotels were like a 
revolving door—that people were 
getting kicked out all the time, 
especially for drug-related viola­
tions. In January, Emmett received 
a call that a room had become avail­
able. To accept it, he simply had to 
show up.
Emmett is a man constantly 
in motion. He once worked as a 
pop-up nightclub organizer, trav­
eling across the country and rent­
ing out event spaces for a handful 
of nights at a time. Throughout 
his first several months at the 
hotel when he was unemployed, 
Emmett would take a series of 
buses across New Haven each day, 
traveling between potential job 
opportunities in film and event 
staging, as well as stores he likes 
to patronize and neighborhoods 
he simply likes to walk in.  When 
we spoke last spring, he sat on a 
able to me,” Emmett said. “There’s 
a freezer there. I could keep cold 
food.”
In hotel rooms, clients can secure 
far more privacy and personal space 
than at the majority of the city’s 
crowded shelters. But they aren’t 
quite treated like regular hotel 
guests. They remain subject to the 
same rules, surveillance, and disci­
plinary consequences of a homeless 
shelter. At random, and sometimes 
without warning, shelter employees 
working at the hotel would knock 
on his door to do a room inspec­
tion, searching for contraband. 
They were “casual,” Emmett said. 
“If you don’t argue and all that shit, 
they just come in and go.” He didn’t 
mind these inspections “too much,” 
he said. He never expected to move 
in with his privacy fully intact. 
“You either utilize the service or 
you don’t.”
Emmett mostly kept to himself in 
the hotel room. He wasn’t there to 
make friends. “They’re not gonna 
end up paying your bills,” he said. 
If there’s one thing Emmett learned 
from years of couch-surfing and 
tent-sleeping, it’s that “nobody’s 
ever gonna pay for your car, put 
gas in your tank, pay the lease on 
your house,” he said. “You must 
always spread your wings and move 
away from people, no matter how 
good they are, or nice they are, or 
friendly.” 
After roaming around the city 
on his job search, Emmett would 
usually go to the store to pick up 
something to eat. He loved barbe­
cue food, and he developed a recent 
habit of mixing lemon iced tea-fla­
vored powder into his water. After 
eating, he would return to the hotel, 
checking his email and text mes­
sages. Then, he would switch on 
the TV. 
Emmett didn’t often remember 
the names of the films he watched 


In addition to hostile 
police interactions, 
people living on 
the streets are 
vulnerable to theft, 
sexual assault, and 
the weather. Despite

life, many unhoused 
people choose to live

in a shelter.
wooden fence in an East Rock 
parking lot, carrying a leather 
cross-body bag and wearing a 
lanyard from his high school hon­
ors society back in California. He 
is used to coming and going from 
place to place, from bed to bed, 
when a new opportunity comes 
his way. So Emmett arrived at 
the hotel the day he received the 
call from the state’s centralized 
resource intake center, 2-1-1, in 
New Haven’s Long Wharf neigh­
borhood.
New Haven Village Suites is 
right by the highway, in a part 
of the city known for its big box 
stores, food trucks, and parking 
lots. Emmett and his roommate 
shared a microwave and stove, 
a television, and a bathroom to 
themselves. In the hotel, “I could 
get up, I could shower, and I 
could go to work. That’s valu­

alone in his hotel room at night. 
The particular stories weren’t as 
important to him as the way those 
stories are told. He isn’t the kind of 
person to switch on the television 
simply to escape into someone else’s 
narrative. Instead, he took note of 
each movie’s production strategies. 
He digested the lighting, the cam­
era’s motion, the rhythm of the dia­
logue. He tried to measure the gaps 
between what a director might have 
envisioned and what the film turned 
out to be.
After the movie was done, he 
would shower. Sleep. Wake up in 
the morning. Eat a bowl of cereal. 
Then, he would leave to look for 
work again. Emmett carried a stack 
of three-page resumes nearly every­
where he went, to hand out to pro­
spective employers. In a letter on 
the final page, he wrote, “I plan to 
be available whenever the offer may 
become valuable for you. I shall 
respond upon notice at any time.” 
He took his desire to find a job 
more seriously than any other com­
mitment; in a few months, he would 
go on to find work at a local steak­
house and as a personal assistant. 
“The person who has the company 
with the job is the most important 
person to me,” he said. “I know 
there’s bigger, better, brighter days 
out there. I just can’t let it get out 
of my mind or my sensibility.” His 
left knee trembled as he spoke, as if 
preparing to resume walking again 
at any moment. 
Cadwell often sits inside the front 
yard tent at the Amistad Catholic 
Worker, the free kitchen and gath­
ering place that Colville and his wife 
Luz Catarineau have run for decades 
out of their own home. Cadwell 
lingers for hours. He likes to tell 
stories about his family. He calls his 
mom, who lives in senior housing 
in the town of Branford, every day. 
“She’s my everything,” he said in 
March. “My best friend.” One day 
when he was 25, he recalled, his 
mother came to him, crying. He’d 
been raised as an only child, but 
his mom revealed that morning 
that he had a biological sister two 
years older than him, who had 
been given up for adoption. He 
met his sister for the first time in 
2005. Every so often, she comes to 
visit. “We’re close, but not as close 
as I’d like us to be,” Cadwell said. 
His sister works in the Life 
Insurance industry. “She does 
really well for herself,” Cadwell 
said inside the Amistad Catho­
lic Worker tent, as he ate from a 
paper plate of rice and sausage. 
“I’m proud of her.” She works 
remotely in a “beautiful” house on 
the Massachusetts-Rhode Island 
border. She cares for a number of 
pet spaniels and horses. “She’s got 
a trailer for the horses, and it’s got 
air-conditioning and everything.”
After living outside for five 
years, Cadwell decided to sign 
up for a hotel room one frigid 
December day. Months later in 
March, he was still on the waitlist. 
(When I tried to reach him again 
in September, his cell number 
redirected to someone else's line.) 
“I respect what they’re doing with 
the hotel beds,” he said. A hotel 
room, he knew, would pose its 
own challenges. He’d heard of 
dozens of people getting thrown 
out for drug use. The curfews, the 
searches, the structure—it would 
all be unfamiliar for Cadwell, 
and probably difficult. “It would 
be hard for someone like me to 
adjust.” But it was freezing out, so 
he signed up anyway.
