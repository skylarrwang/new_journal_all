beaten in the street and rows of 
houses were burned. 


Over a decade later, in the early 
days of Bolshevik rule, the atmo­
sphere of reactionary violence lin­
gered in the area, and became a 
formative experience of Sokolov’s 
youth. In the summer of 1921, on 
a school-sponsored “cultural trip” 
to the Verkhovsky District, a few 
miles to the east of Orel, he got 
a glimpse of fighting in the Tam­
bov Rebellion, a grain farmers’ 
revolt against the Bolsheviks that 
devolved into vicious conflict. 


It was a war that the Red Army 
feared it could lose. Both sides 
slaughtered civilians, prisoners, 
and the families of their enemies. 
By June, the forests on Orel’s out­
skirts, where the farmers staged 
attacks on Red Army encamp­
ments in town, were clouded with 
poison gas. The scene was ripe 
with material for Sokolov’s per­
sonal mythology of persecution—
destruction seemed to chase him 
everywhere—and he’d tell it for 
the next 50 years as a kind of ori­
gin story. 


By the time Sokolov graduated 
from secondary school, in 1930, 
his father had fled for Siberia to 
avoid Stalin’s purges. He was still 
in Orel, living at home and con­
templating the future. He applied 
to universities in Moscow and 
Leningrad to study literature, 
but his “social origin”—as an heir 
to an old marriage of gentry and 
clergy—disqualified him. He went 
to work at a factory in the city for 
two years to try to scrub his aristo­
cratic past. Then, like other chil­
dren of White Russia, he applied 
to the local Teachers’ College, 
enrolled undercover as an ex-la­
borer, and graduated in four years. 
In 1937, he was hired at a Tech­
nical College in the nearby town 
of Ramon, commuting daily from 
Orel. 


Late one night in Decem­
ber 1937, he returned to the city 
by train. On the walk home, the 
streets were silent and dark. The 
river was high. He approached 
the gate of the house where he 
was renting a room. A light was 
on in the window, and the owner 
of the house was waiting for him 
there in silhouette. The NKVD—
the secret police—had come by 
earlier in the evening looking for 
him, the owner told him. He had 
to leave. Immediately. So he fled 
a thousand miles west by train to 
a city called Samara and hid there 
for several months.


In the summer, he came back 
east to Voronezh, a city near Orel 
that he knew from his youth. He 
lived under an assumed name and 
stayed with friends, who helped 
him get a position at a local college 
before the start of the school year, 
teaching literature. At the school, 
Sokolov laid low. He taught Rus­
sian classics and American ones in 
translation. Dreiser, Sinclair, and 
Hemingway were all on his sylla­
bus. In class, he nursed a dream of 
becoming a novelist. Outside, he 
nursed a chronic heart condition, 
which, he later said, had saved him 
from the draft. 


By the fall of 1941, the Nazis 
had voided their non-aggression 
pact with the Soviets and begun 
a war of annihilation on the East­
ern Front. Sokolov was still com­
fortable, monitoring the progress 
of the war by radio. He had been 
promoted to educational director 
of the college, fielding questions 
from the staff, who were growing 
uneasy about the city’s fate. “She 
was asking about her family,” he 
would write in 1957 about a meet­
ing with a Jewish teacher at the 
college, who sought his advice on 
whether to stay or go. “Her father, 
a simple tailor, did not want to be 
evacuated with the Bolsheviks. 
I advised her, of course, to leave 
immediately, since the rumours of 
German extermination of the Jews 
were being confirmed. However, 
neither she nor her family believed 
these rumours, regarding them as 
Bolshevik propaganda.” 


In September 1941, Sokolov 
returned to Orel for several days 
to see friends in the military and 
hear about developments on the 
front. “They said the Germans 
had camped in the forests around 
Bryansk and weren’t expected to 
begin an offensive for a while,” 
he wrote in 1954. But the attack 
began the next week, just days 
after Sokolov had headed back to 
Voronezh. By early October, the 
Nazis had made Orel a colony of 
the Reich and the central outpost 
for the eastern campaign. On the 
eve of the invasion, about 100,000 
people lived in the city. The next 
summer, only 38,000 people were 
left. Many were killed by artil­
lery, guillotined or garroted in the 
public square, set on fire, starved, 
marched to the forest and buried 
alive, or enslaved and sent by train 
to forced labor camps in Germany. 
Others fled the city for Soviet ter­
ritory further east or walked into 
the woods to join the partisans—
bands of Soviet-aligned soldiers 
scattered throughout the region. 
Nazi commandos hunted the Jews 
of Orel door-to-door until as 
late as November 1942, torturing 
them publicly before massacring 
them in the forest. 


Orel was more than a military 
anchor for the Nazis. It was an 
experiment in Hitler’s vision for 
a pan-continental Reich, where 
the frontier was cleared of Jews 
and Slavs by genocide and repop­
ulated by Germans. The Nazis 
leveled the city and slaughtered its

people, but to sanitize their image 
and subvert the Soviets, they built 
institutions after the fact and 
recruited locals—especially local 
professionals. They restarted the 
schools, repaired infrastructure, 
opened orphanages, subsidized 
a theater for anti-Bolshevik ora­
tors and entertainment that didn’t 
offend the new command—bread 
and circuses for those who stayed 
to see what the Nazis would do. 
But the most important institution 
was the newspaper. 


Sokolov didn’t need recruiting. 
Voronezh fell to the Nazis about a 
year after Orel, in July 1942. The 
battle for the city was among the 
most apocalyptic on the eastern 
front. Over half a million people 
were killed in under a month of 
fighting. Sokolov, his wife, Alev­
tina, a teacher at the college whom 
he had married that March, and 
her young daughter from a previ­
ous marriage, left after the city fell 
and walked through neighboring 
villages, 30 miles a day for two 
days, until they reached a train 
line that would take them back to 


When they got to the Orel sta­
tion, Sokolov picked up a copy of 
the local paper. He read it cover to 
cover in the terminal. The name, 
printed across the top of the page 
in rounded Cyrillic, was Rech—
“Speech”—and it stayed in his head 
for days. “I waited and hoped,” he 
later wrote of the moment, “and 
now I saw a word, a new word of 
truth. What was in it? What was 
in that word?” 


III.
The family settled in Orel. 
They stayed with an old friend 
for a few weeks while Sokolov 
looked for work. He was looking 
for a way to join the war against 
the Soviets, and his friend recom­
mended going to city hall, where 
he applied for an editorial job at 
Rech, the paper that caught his eye 
back at the station. The Nazi pro­
paganda unit screened him, liked 
his background—young ex-aristo­
crat, ex-teacher, devout, anti-Bol­
shevik to the bone—and called him 
for an interview. He showed up at 
the paper’s offices the next week, 
and met with two of its lead­
ers, the head writer, an ex-Soviet 
journalist named Mikhail Oktan, 
and the editor-in-chief, a German 
officer named Artur Bay.  


They hired Sokolov as a staff 
writer and copy editor. For his 
byline, he chose the pseudonym 
Samarin, after the 19th century 
Russian reformer and Slavophile 
philosopher, Yuri Samarin, “a 
great patriot,” he would later say. 
Now Samarin, Sokolov saw the 
position as a kind of patriotic call­
ing to resurrect a fallen Russia. He 
became a fixture at the paper. He 
climbed the ladder, wrote front-
page editorials, was promoted to 
literary editor in charge of the 
paper’s tone and style guide, and 
was then made deputy editor-in-
chief. He read what the Nazis’ 
propaganda heads put out and 
wired to the frontier, imitating 
their style. The Nazis wanted the 
press in their colonies to sell copy, 
entertain, outrage, and addict the 
population to their line. Those 
were the merits Sokolov learned 
to judge his work by. By late 
1942, the paper’s circulation had 
grown to 100,000, with distri­
bution channels throughout the 
region. 	


Sokolov proved he was reliable, 
and the Nazis rewarded him. They 
bought him a well-appointed 
villa in the old aristocratic sec­
tion of the city. They ensured he 
had good food and sharp clothes. 
They flew him on Luftwaffe 
flights to Germany on “fact-find­
ing” expeditions to see how the 
Germans lived and to tour Russian 
slave labor camps in Stuttgart and 
Munich so he could advertise them 
back in Orel. And they decorated 
him with a medal for “Bravery and 
Services” to the Reich on Hitler’s 
birthday. The world the Bolshe­
viks destroyed was now his again.     


At the paper, he built up a rep­
utation as a skilled propagandist 
with preferred themes: “Kike-Bol­
shevism,” Jewish “conquest of the 
world,” Jewish provocation of 
the war, Jewish “domination” in 
England and America, the Pro­
tocols of the Elders of Zion, and 
the Russian Liberation Army—
the Nazis’ corps of 50,000 Soviet 
defectors. 


Sokolov was useful because he 
combined four traits the Nazis 
looked for: venom, obedience, 
striving, and kitsch. What he 
wrote for the paper was graphic 
but 
also 
completely 
unorigi­
nal, repeating the tropes of the 
Judeo-Bolshevik myth, which, as 
the historian Paul Hanebrik writes 
in his 2018 book A Specter Haunt­
ing Europe, “was constructed from 
the raw materials of anti-Judaism, 
recycled and rearranged to meet 
new requirements.” Of a piece in 
a Soviet newspaper on the occu­
pation of Orel, Sokolov wrote: 
“I was so disgusted and repelled 
that I wanted to spit in a frenzy 
(will the reader forgive these harsh 
words of mine) because right 
out of the page there was staring 
at me a face with a hooked Kike 
nose.” On the Nazis: “The world 
has been divided into two parts. 
Germany and its allies represent a 
force intended to bring mankind 
order and justice.” Of the Allies: 
“In this war the people of Europe

and Asia are fighting against Jew­
ish plutocracy and Jewish Bolshe­
vism, against two outwardly dif­
ferent but inwardly like systems, 
systems which have brought the 
peoples only suffering.” About the 
Russian Revolution: “The Kikes 
made it their goal to cause bloody 
clashes within states by means of 
their deceptive, hypocritical slo­
gans, and to rush to power them­
selves.” On religion: “The Kikes 
waged a relentless and cruel war 
against religion, not despising any 
means, not even terror.”


Together, 
Sokolov’s 
words 
constituted a worldview he could 
justify and weaponize—and later 
deny he ever had. It was a sys­
tem of belief he and people of his 
milieu were devoted to, both as 
an explanation for their sudden 
loss of control over Russia and as a 
strategy for clawing it back. It was 
as expedient as it was sincere, as 
radical as it was typical, as Tsarist 
as it was Nazi.   


In the spring of 1943, Sokolov 
wrote a piece that became the 
magnum opus of his career at the 
paper. It was called “The Former 
Masters of Orel,” and it began 
with a reminiscence: “Memories 
of the Soviet times are connected 
with memories of the Kikes, the 
true masters of the USSR.” He 
remembered being in Kharkiv, a 
city in the northeast of Ukraine, 
on his way back from a trip to 
Crimea. It was 1941, and the war 
had just begun. “As much as the 
Jews were self-assured and impu­
dent before the war,” he wrote, “so 
much were they frightened and 
disturbed after it began...The city 
was like a disturbed anthill. It was 
easy to see: the Kikes are scared!” 
The terror the Jews of Kharkiv felt 
at the onset of the war brought 
Sokolov glee. So did the certainty 
of what would come next. The 
Nazis took Kharkiv in October. 
That winter, they killed 15,000 of 
the city’s Jews and buried them in 
a mass grave in the Drobytsky Yar 
ravine. To conserve bullets, the 
Nazis threw children alive among 
the piles of corpses and waited for 
the cold to kill them.     


Sokolov dedicated the rest of 
the article to listing Jews in the 
city by name and profession, to 
prove that they had ruled the city 
in the shadows before the Nazi 
“liberation.” Most of the 47 people 
he lists were teachers, doctors or 
bookkeepers. Later, in his defense, 
he said that he knew at the time 
that he wasn’t endangering any 
of the people he named. After all, 
they had already been killed or 
enslaved by the Nazis. 


***
By August 1943, the Sovi­
ets were on the verge of retak­
ing Orel, and Rech was pulping 
its archives. The Nazis evacuated 
west and took Sokolov and the rest 
of the staff with them. They went 
to Bryansk, then Bobruisk, which 
they still occupied, and restarted 
the press. In Bobruisk, Sokolov 
joined the last gasp of organized 
Russian collaboration on the fron­
tier, a small phalanx called the 
League for the Struggle Against 
Bolshevism, which his Rech super­
viser Mikhail Oktan had founded 
soon after they arrived in the city. 
To be admitted, members had to 
swear an oath to Hitler. Bobruisk 
fell to the Soviets less than a year 
later. When the city fell, the Nazis 
evacuated to Berlin, where they 
parked Sokolov in the offices of 
one, then another of their fatigu­
ing newspapers, still courting 
Russian defectors as the war drew 
to a close. 


After the war, he moved with his 
wife and daughter to the British 
Zone in West Germany, rented  a 
one-bedroom apartment in Ham­
burg, and edited the anti-com­
munist weekly Put for a couple of 
years. He then moved four hours 
south to the city of Limburg an 
der Lahn to edit Posev, the jour­
nal of the National Alliance of 
Russian Solidarists (NTS), a global 
network of militant nationalist 
Soviet emigrés who spent the early 
decades of the Cold War planning 
an anti-Bolshevik revolution. The 
NTS preached a kind of big tent 
anti-communism, but the origins 
of its German chapter were Nazi, 
and its reactionary goals resembled 
every other attempt at fascism. In 
Sokolov, they found a leader.   


But by 1951, the work was 
getting stale. Soviet emigration 
had shifted to the U.S. and with 
it went the center of emigré 
anti-communism. Sokolov was 
looking to get out of Germany 
and into America. On May 21, 
1952, he went to the Displaced 
Persons Commission in Wen­

The Nazi propaganda unit screened 
him, liked his background—young 
ex-aristocrat, ex-teacher, devout, an­
ti-Bolshevik to the bone—and called 
him for an interview.
