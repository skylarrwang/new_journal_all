P
rofessor Laurie Santos stands before a dark 
background, wearing a simple blue shirt 
and black jacket. She speaks deliberately and 
warmly—almost like a grade school teacher—as she 
traces celebrity’s etymology from the ancient Greeks’ 
devotion to their constellary gods on Mount Olym­
pus to cosmopolitan stars in the modern era. Then a 
giant bottle of Chanel Nº5 fills the screen.
The fashion house had selected 
the Yale psychology professor 
for its ad campaign celebrat­
ing the 100th anniversary 
of the creation of Chanel 
Nº5, the scent that Coco 
Chanel said smelled “like 
a woman, not like a 
rose.” Chanel was rec­
ognizing a new sort of 
celebrity—a 
nontradi­
tional, more egalitarian 
one exemplified by writ­
ers and journalists. In 
the video, Santos, who 
both studies celebrity 
and has become famous 
herself, suggests that a 
fascination with celebrity 
is intertwined with human DNA—it has always been 
present, albeit in different forms. However, the rise 
of social media, she notes, has altered the way people 
relate to celebrities: famous people are more acces­
sible to their fans, and ordinary people can become 
famous overnight.
“The famous people are becoming not so different 
from us and the everyday regular people are becom­
ing famous,” Santos said at the end of the commer­
cial. “So I think this is a real revolution in the way 
celebrity is playing out in our culture right now.”
Santos’ research centers on animal psychology. 
But she is well-known beyond academic circles for 
her class titled “Psychology and the Good Life,” the 
most popular course ever offered at Yale. In 2018, 
Santos began teaching the course online under the 
title “The Science of Well Being.” In the three years 
since, more than three million people have taken the 
class.
In 2019, Santos expanded her audience and 
launched The Happiness Lab Podcast, 
which has more than thirty-five mil­
lion downloads. In recognition 
of her status, she was named 
TIME’s “Leading Campus 
Celebrity.” Since launching 
the podcast, she’s been rec­
ognized in the airport and 
while completing curb­
side pickup at Target.
“That feels really weird, 
but it’s [only] a few peo­
ple,” Santos said. “It’s not 
like I’m Beyoncé.”
Santos told me that she 
does not consider her­
self “fashion commercial 
material.” She remained 
adamant that she does not fit into the category of 
academic celebrity and said she doesn’t know of 
many academics who have become famous for their 
work. She seemed to suggest that fame is outside of 
the realm of academia and scholarship—an idea that 
might once have been true but which researchers 
now call into question.
Though Santos said she does not see herself as 
a celebrity, she is part of an emerging trend that 
Oxford University researcher Peter William Walsh 
has dubbed “celebrity academics.” He provided the 
examples of Judith Butler and Anthony Giddens. 
Academic celebrities, he explained, differ from schol­

ars who are merely respected in their field because of 
the adulation and emotional attraction—and some­
times jealousy and derision—they inspire among 
their peers.
Through the podcast, Walsh said Santos might 
even have ascended to the status of a public intel­
lectual—someone who is recognizable to the average 
educated person, like Cornel West or Stephen Hawk­
ing. By contrast, a celebrity academic is known by 
nearly everyone in their field but would be unrecog­
nizable to most members of broader society.
Social media blurs the distinctions between the two 
groups, allowing academics to reach a far broader 
audience. It also allows scholars to display their per­
sonalities beyond their research—what Walsh called 
the “veridical self.” For example, Tufts University 
Professor Daniel Drezner and University of Man­
chester Professor Brian Cox have each launched suc­
cessful Twitter accounts that share both research and 
personal anecdotes. This access facilitates a subjective 
and emotional relationship between the celebrity and 
their supporters, Walsh added.
When I called Walsh over Zoom, I interrupted his 
listening to Santos’ podcast—a discussion of Aristo­
tle’s eudaimonia, from The Nicomachean Ethics. San­
tos is unusual in her ability to convey such compli­
cated ideas clearly, Walsh said. “She speaks so well,” 
he said. “There’s something about her personality, 
about the relationship that I form with that person­
ality by listening to her podcast, that makes me like 
her and that makes me give her my attention, which 
feeds into her celebrity status.”
In Walsh’s telling, the phenomenon of celebrity 
in academia arose in the nineteen-seventies and 
nineteen-eighties, when mass media began allowing 
people to learn about the lives of researchers beyond 
their scholarly output. Since then, celebrity in aca­
demia has surged ahead, with the most famous schol­
ars, including Richard Dawkins and Michael Porter, 
amassing thousands of Twitter followers and massive 
citation counts on their papers. 
Becoming famous usually confers an advantage 
upon scholars. Academia is generally a cutthroat 
industry, with pressure to rapidly accrue funding 
and publish to gain a competitive edge in the tenure 
process, Walsh told me. Celebrated academics can be 
released from teaching engagements to have more 
time for research and are much more likely to receive 
tenure or job opportunities, he said. Journal editors 
likely know their research areas and can tell who the 
author is, meaning their work is much more likely to 
be published, he added.
Walsh also noted that celebrity in academia is 
often accused of lowering the quality of scholarly 
output. Some argue that academic celebrities spend 
time on speaking engagements instead of research, 
that their work is published in part because of their 
status, and that journals do not subject famous aca­
demics to standard reviewing procedures. On the 
other hand, celebrity academics can communicate 
their research much more widely than most scholars; 
Santos, for example, shares her research with people 
who might not otherwise have access to academic 
articles or university courses.
Still, the idea that celebrity is at play in scholarship 
often receives resistance from members of the pro­
fession because it seems antithetical to the value of 
reason in academia, Walsh said.
“That kind of stuff is frivolous…Celebrity is the 
froth of modern life. Academia is supposed to be the 
substance. It’s truth. It’s beauty,” Walsh said. 
He argued that the decreased barriers to academic 
fame—facilitated by social media’s rise—would lead 
not to democratization but to further inequity among 
scholars. Although more people have the potential 
to reach celebrity status, only a few will do so—and 
only they will reap the benefits of fame.
“It’s still on this upward trajectory, we’re going 
to see increasing differences, more inequality within 
academia,” Walsh said. “Inequality in status, in pay, 
in fame, in citation count, in Twitter followers—
we’re going to see that continue to grow.”
As Santos told it in the Chanel commercial, celeb­
rity seemed limitless and open to all. She spoke of the 
democratization of celebrity with optimism—now, 
she said, people truly feel they can become a celeb­
rity, or at least become friends with one. But as San­
tos finished sharing her message, and her image gave 
way to a $220 bottle of perfume, it was hard to be so 
optimistic.
