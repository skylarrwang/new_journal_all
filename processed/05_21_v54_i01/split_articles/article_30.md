tle. “Starting something new at a 
law school, especially an elite law 
school, is really hard, especially 
when it’s something that goes 
against the grain of what people 
are typically taught and is not 
particularly well-funded by out­
side organizations,” said Sarang 
Shah, a former student editor of 
the blog who founded Berke­
ley’s LPE student group in 2019. 
Right-wing 
potshots, 
centrist 
co-option, or simply running out 
of steam (or money) are all real 
possibilities. 

“You know how you have 
rocks in a river, and if you’re 
right behind them you can avoid 
the power of the current? That’s 
kind of what LPE feels like,” 
added Conor Reynolds, who took 
part in the first LPE seminar and 
returned to Yale to teach envi­
ronmental law after he graduated. 

What the movement does have 
in its favor is the nascent hunger 
of a younger generation to get 
a grip on the crisis-riven world 
it was born into, and to find the 
terms and the means to remake 
it. As Redburn put it, “We’re the 
children of the total failure of aus­
terity politics. We’re the Occu­
piers and later the Black Lives 
Matter people, where our theory 
of change involves the wisdom of 
social movements and mass orga­
nization and not elite technoc­
racy, which we’ve experienced as 
a total failure.”

“What’s really happening is 
that you have a millennial and 
post-millennial generation that 
just doesn’t believe what their law 
professors tell them anymore,” 
said Sam Moyn, a law professor at 
Yale and contributor to the blog. 
“We’re talking about a limited 
number of people, but there’s a 
group of them in a lot of places 
and it’s big enough to matter.” 

While the last decade of left 
social movement ferment has 
yielded no shortage of incisive 
critiques of the present order of 
things, the pressing question, 
according to Purdy, is “what is 
going to get built that lasts?” 

“Critical work is just not nearly 
enough, and rejectionist stances 
have very limited scope,” he said. 
“Constructive 
vocabularies—
which is not to say conciliatory 
or ‘nice’ vocabularies, but vocab­
ularies which are worldmak­
ing and institution-making—are 
really important.” In its own way, 
the law and economics vocabu­
lary that LPE so stridently resists 
has been profoundly construc­
tive—we’re still living in the world 
it helped make. Much hinges on 
whether LPE will be able to make 
a new one.

**Title: MOT**
**Author: Aaron Magloire**

Death is a day trip. I drowned myself 
in the river and then got bored of it. 
One can only spend so long small 
talking with murk. My dreams, my firm 
works, my honey and bread. It is time to 
dine again. Enough fucking around. 
Watch now, as I emerge fully dry from the water 
that could not stomach me, my mouth ablaze 
with aphids and blue moths, 
my fresh deerskin dress. There is no 
myth here. Only the fact of my body 
warming as it walks forth 
into the clearing. Tell me again, 
the name of your god.
