even realized until I came across 
it.” 

In the spring of 2019, after 
nearly two years of unpaid vol­
unteer work, mostly by students, 
the blog’s faculty co-directors 
secured a $610,000 grant from the 
Hewlett Foundation through its 
Beyond Neoliberalism initiative. 
The grant allowed the professors 
to officially launch the “Law and 
Political Economy Project” and 
to hire Corinne Blalock, who had 
just finished a JD/PhD at Duke, as 
its Executive Director. 

Like Whitlow, Blalock was 
shocked by the sheer exis­
tence of the project. Back in 
2015, she’d written a journal 
article lamenting the decline 
of left-wing legal theory in 
the academy. The heyday 
of Critical Legal Studies, a 
leftist legal movement that 
originated at Harvard Law 
School and flourished in the 
nineteen-seventies and nine­
teen-eighties, was long past. 
Gone were the days when law 
professors were proclaiming 
themselves “guerilla warriors” 
and urging their students to 
seek out employment at big 
corporations just to sabotage 
them from within. Blalock 
remembers being laughed at for 
ending her article with a “sort of 
cheesy call to arms” for a reinvig­
orated left legal movement. “The 
idea of a leftist legal movement, 
even in 2015, was unthinkable,” 
she said.

Yet here Blalock was four years 
later, at the center of just that 
kind of movement. Demand for 
Kapczynski’s seminar swelled to 
nearly a hundred students—just 
under a sixth of the entire law 
school. Suddenly, LPE student 
groups were popping up at law 
schools all around the country 
(they currently number over a 
dozen). The blog’s readership 
continued to grow, and the proj­
ect began holding events that 
drew scholars from every legal 
field and other academic dis­
ciplines. “We grew way faster 
than we expected,” Blalock said, 
reflecting on the beginning of her 
tenure. “LPE really took off.”

But Blalock warned against 
seeing the early growth of LPE as 
the sign of a broader bellwether. 
“Sometimes I feel like we’re a 
little bit of a Potemkin Village,” 
she said. “The project is only two 
years old.” If LPE represented an 
American law school version of 
German radical Rudi Dutschke’s 
famous 1968 call for leftists 
to embark on a “long march 
through the institutions,” then it 
was just taking its first baby steps. 
Plus, Blalock added, “You have 
to acknowledge what we’re up 
against.” 

IV.

On September 3, 2014—his 
very first day of law school, two-
and-a-half years before he’d find 
his way into the first LPE semi­
nar—Will Bloom sat in his 1L 
contracts course and listened to 
his professor’s disquisition on 
Lucy v. Zehmer. A 1954 Vir­
ginia Supreme Court decision 
commonly taught in first-year 
contracts courses, the case con­
sidered whether a farmer who 
had drunkenly sold his farm 
could renege on the agreement 
(the court ruled against the 
farmer). Midway through the 
class, Bloom’s professor went on 
a “weird economics tangent,” 
arguing that if the farmer valued 
his property more than the per­
son he sold it to, he could have 
just bought it back. 

“I remember raising my 
hand and asking, ‘What if the 
farmer doesn’t have enough 
money to buy it back?’ and 
the professor was like, ‘Well, 
we just don’t think about 
that because then the theory 
won’t work,’ and then stared 
at me and waited for me to 
accept that,” Bloom said. “It 
was a moment when I real­
ized, Oh, this is all made up. 
These people just have some 
wild fucking ideas that don’t 
really have any bearing on the 
world—except they do have a 
bearing on the world because 
they’re part of a decades long polit­
ical project to impose them.” 

Central to that political proj­
ect is the rise of “law and eco­
nomics,” an approach to juris­
prudence that attempts to apply 
the principles of neoclassical 
economics to the study of law. 
In the early nineteen-seventies, 
law and economics was the mar­
ginal remit of a group of liber­
tarian eccentrics, most of whom 
were based out of the Univer­
sity of Chicago. Keynesian eco­
nomics and legal liberalism had 
won the day following the New


--- Page 35 ---

Deal, and few in the legal acad­
emy took Chicago’s libertarians 
seriously. Yet over the com­
ing decades, law and econom­
ics utterly transformed the legal 
academy, thanks in large part 
to the dogged efforts (and deep 
pockets) of one man: John Olin. 

A chemical and munitions 
magnate, Olin was radicalized 
after a group of militant black 
students took over the student 
union at Cornell, his alma mater, 
during parents weekend in 1969. 
Following 
the 
uprising—the 
first-ever armed occupation of a 
building on an American cam­
pus—Olin vowed to use his for­
tune to “to help to preserve the 
system which made its accumu­
lation possible.”

The Olin Foundation went 
on to spend $68 million under­
writing the growth of law and 
economics, dishing out millions 
of dollars to Harvard, Yale, and 
other elite law schools to estab­
lish law and economics programs 
and hire law and economics 
scholars (the investigative jour­
nalist Jane Meyer dubbed Olin an 
“academic Johnny Appleseed”). 
Over more than two decades, 
Yale received nearly $20 million 
from the foundation, much of 
it dedicated to establishing the 
John M. Olin Center for Law, 
Economics and Public Policy. 

“We had a really large invest­
ment in ideology that had no 
match on the left or even among 
centrist liberals,” said Frank 
Pasquale LAW ’01, a professor 
at Brooklyn School of Law and a 
frequent writer for the blog.

By 2000, the foundation con­
sidered its donations to Yale to 
be an “excellent investment” and 
“one of our most influential Law 
and Economics grants.” As early 
as 1993, Yale Law Professor (and 
future dean) Anthony Kronman 
LAW ’75 called the rapid expan­
sion of law and economics the 
“most important change in Amer­
ican legal education in the last 
twenty-five years.” Internal Olin 
Foundation documents praised 
Kronman for “doing all he can to 
assure the permanency of the pro­
gram.” In 2008, political scientist 
Steven Teles crowned law and 
economics “the most successful 
intellectual movement in the law 
of the past thirty years, having 
rapidly moved from insurgency 
to hegemony.” Olin’s dream of 
yanking law schools to the right 
had come true. As James Piereson, 
the foundation’s long-time direc­
tor, bragged to Teles, “Law and 
economics is neutral, but it has a 
philosophical thrust in the direc­
tion of free markets and limited 
government. That is, like many 
disciplines, it seems neutral but 
isn’t.”

For 
Ted 
Hamilton, 
who 
entered Harvard Law School in 
2013 and is currently a PhD stu­
dent in comparative literature at 
Yale, the influence of law and 
economics could be captured in 
one mantra. “The most repeated 
word in my first year law curric­
ulum was not justice, or liberty or 
order,” Hamilton wrote in a 2014 
essay reflecting on his first year at 
Harvard Law School. “It was effi­
ciency.”

Indeed, 
“efficiency” 
is 
watchword of law and economics, 
its guiding shibboleth. At its core, 
law and economics holds that the 
law should be oriented above all 
to achieving economic efficiency, 
with “efficiency” largely defined 
as the pursuit of “wealth maximi­
zation,” in which goods and ser­
vices flow to those with the larg­
est “willingness to pay” for them. 
(It was a version of this argu­
ment that Bloom’s contracts 
professor made on his first day 
of class.) The rise of law and 
economics firmly cemented this 
form of legal reasoning as the 
default framework in “private 
law” courses—such as property, 
torts, 
and 
contracts—which 
are frontloaded in Yale’s legal 
curriculum. As Bradlow put 
it, “The dominant legal frame­
work made you ask the ques­
tion, ‘Given the current set of 
power relations, what is the 
most efficient way to distribute 
resources?’ It wasn’t asking the 
prior question, ‘Is the current 
distribution of power in our 
country just, and how is the 
law structuring the distribution 
of that power?’” 

Part of why law and econom­
ics methods took such a power­
ful hold in law schools was that 
little else in legal teaching or 
scholarship offered much in the 
way of a countervailing force. 
During the same decades that 
saw the rise of law and eco­
nomics in private law, public 
law fields such as constitutional 
law—which were dominated 
by liberals for most of the 20th 
century—almost 
universally 
retreated from engaging ques­
tions of economic power and 
structural inequality. “In public 
law classes, the common sense 
is still the same [as in private 
law classes],” added Blalock. 
“You don’t talk about class 
disparities, and you don’t talk 
about power.”

By the turn of the twen­
ty-first century, legal fields 
considered “about the econ­
omy” had little to nothing to 
say about political life, while 
those considered fundamen­
tally political lacked a robust

account of economic power. For 
anyone in law schools interested 
in crossing those boundaries (or 
in pointing out their artificiality 
to begin with), the prospect of 
even coming across intelligibly to 
professors and peers was dim.  
“There was something about 
the dominant vocabularies that 
sort of baffled and almost numbed 
any attempt to get hold of the 
most important questions,” said 
Purdy of his time as a student at 
Yale. “It always felt as if to raise 
issues of distribution, of power, 
of the role and nature of the state, 
was to commit a kind of jejune 
mistake.” Sam Aber ’17 LAW ’22, 
a current student editor of the 
blog, echoed Purdy’s feelings. “It 
can feel like this huge narrowing 
in what you’re allowed to say, in 
what kind of arguments are per­
missible or even make sense.” 

For most Yale Law students, 
that narrowing came to feel natu­
ral. At the end of his 1L contracts 
class in 2014, Manfredi remem­
bers a group discussion where he 
explained a simple hypothetical, 
in which a maximally “efficient” 
world—one with the “largest pos­
sible pie,” as economists are wont 
to say—entailed extreme satisfac­
tion for a minority of people and 
mass suffering for the rest, whereas 
a "less efficient" world might have 
substantial satisfaction, but for all 
people. “One of my classmates 
turned around and said, ‘Oh my 
god. I’d never thought about it 
like that. I thought that we were 
supposed to think in terms of 
efficiency because that was just 
the goal of law and that it would 
always 
make 
things 
better,’” 
Manfredi remembered. “And I 
just thought to myself, This is 
how Yale Law School is teaching 
people to think: they tell you to 
accept "maximizing efficiency" as an 
end in and of itself—and that idea 
becomes unquestioned common sense 
for people who are going to go on to 
be extremely powerful, who will go 
on to run elite institutions someday.”  

Indeed, Manfredi’s classmate 
was far from an outlier. A 2015 
study co-authored by Yale Law 
professor Daniel Markovitz ’91 
LAW ’00 surveyed Yale Law stu­
dents and found that nearly 80 
percent displayed a preference for 
“efficiency” over “equality,” while 
less than half of average Ameri­
cans exhibited the same prefer­
ence. It also found that the Yale 
Law students were significantly 
more likely to display “selfish” 
economic preferences than their 
non-elite peers. Such a commit­
ment to efficiency—which Mar­
kovits and one co-author called 
“overwhelming, indeed almost 
eccentric”—was especially strik­
ing given the Yale students’ stated 
political affiliations: over 90 per­
cent identified as Democrats. 

Over half a century, the meth­
ods, assumptions, and values of 
law and economics so deeply 
permeated legal scholarship and 
pedagogy that they faded into the 
background, enshrining a set of 
market fundamentalist orienta­
tions as just part of what it means 
to “think like a lawyer.” “What 
the common sense makes unsay­
able is just as powerful as being 
asked to, for example, determine 
if this or that regulation is effi­
cient,” Blalock said. “It’s incred­
ibly hard to argue with precisely 
because it’s invisible.”

Over the first weekend of 
April 2020, the LPE Project was 
scheduled to bring over a hun­
dred scholars and students to 
New Haven for its first major 
conference, with dozens of pan­
els on subjects ranging from the 
international law of money to 
the political economy of moth­
erhood. While Covid-19 spoiled 
the conference plans, the pan­
demic and the many disruptions 
it precipitated also provided a 
near-daily confirmation of LPE’s 
foundational intuition: that poli­
tics and the economy cannot be 
separated.  

Early 
pandemic 
discourses 
around “essential workers”—dis­
proportionately women and peo­
ple of color, chronically underpaid 
and precariously employed—illus­
trated the centrality of racialized 
and gendered subordination to the 
structure of the American econ­
omy. As the pandemic plunged 
the country into a recession, the 
federal government’s spending 
on aid exploded neoliberal bud­
get orthodoxy, even as most of 
the stimulus ended up lining the 
pockets of wealthy investors. The 
summer’s protests drew renewed 
attention to the links between 
municipal 
finance, 
residential 
segregation, local economies, and 
chronic disinvestment in Black 
communities. 

And 
envi­
ronmental backdrop to it all—a 
swelling tide of climate disasters, 
from the Australian bushfires to 
the heat waves and hurricanes 
of this summer—offered a potent 
reminder of what climate activ­
ists have been saying for decades: 
that anything less than a funda­
mental transformation of our cur­
rent economic and political order 
courts utter catastrophe. 

Whether the Law and Polit­
ical Economy movement will 
push legal scholarship and prac­
tice to live up to the exigencies 
of this moment is ultimately an 
open question. In many ways, the 
movement faces an uphill bat­
