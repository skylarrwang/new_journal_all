THE  NEW  JOURNAL
S
ea Street and Howard Avenue is just like any other 
intersection in City Point, a neighborhood at 
the southern tip of New Haven. It’s a quiet, 
residential area, with colonial-style houses, well-
mown lawns and chairs set out on the porches. Today 
is Wednesday, trash day, and the garbage bins have 
been rolled down to the curb. This, I’ve been told, is 
the best place to find a Monk Parakeet.  


Up where the branch of a nearby tree hangs over 
a parked car, there’s a giant bundle of dead twigs, 
like an enormous, desiccated beehive. As I look, a 
bird flutters out of the nest and lands delicately on 
a utility pole. It’s about a foot long and the color 
of lime candy, with blue-tipped wings and a short, 
rounded beak, like a pair of pliers. I hear a snap­
ping sound and look over just in time to see another 
shock of green feathers wrestling a twig from a 
dead branch. The two of them look like something 
you might expect to find on a Jamaican doorstep 
singing a sweet song to Bob Marley—not here, a 
block away from the Connecticut Turnpike, their 
squawks blending with the rumble of a passing gar­
bage truck. 


Monk Parakeets are native to the savannas of 
South America, but for the last fifty  years, they’ve 
established wild and self-sustaining colonies up and 
down the coast of Connecticut, as well as New 
York, Florida, and even parts of Texas. By nesting 
communally–each condo-like structure big enough 
to fill the back of a pickup truck–they insulate 
themselves against frosty New England winters. It’s 
still unclear how they settled here, over five thou­
sand  miles from their native habitat. But that hasn’t 
stopped people from theorizing.


“I actually know the origin of the parakeets,” 
Heather writes at the bottom of an article in 
Damned Connecticut—an online journal featuring the 
“weird, the odd, or the unexplained” in Connecti­
cut. “They appeared in Stamford in the early nine­
ties  after a truck transporting them was involved 
in an accident.” Lenny disagrees. “The truth of the 
matter is this,” he writes. “The parakeets escaped 
from the Beardsley Zoo in Bridgeport about fif­
teen years ago.” Another commenter, aptly named 
MY2CENTS, interjects. “Lenny was close ... the 
birds escaped from the Railway Express Terminal in 
Bridgeport.” 


The truth is probably less spectacular than the 
readers of Damned Connecticut would have you 
believe, involving some combination of exasperated 
pet owners and crafty parakeet escapees in the late 
nineteen-sixties and early nineteen-seventies. “They 
are noisy pets and perhaps irresponsible pet own­
ers grew tired of the constant squawks and released 
them outside,” the Connecticut Audubon Society 
speculates. Free from the private serenading of their 
pets, those owners—and everyone else in City Point 
for that matter—suffer now from a very public army 
of wild squawkers. 


“[The parakeets] are up at dawn and you can 
often hear hundreds of the birds chattering at the 
same time,” said Noble Proctor, a former Professor 
of Ornithology at Southern Connecticut State Uni­
versity, in an interview with the website CTMQ. 
“It’s penetrating.” 


Standing below the nest on Sea Street, I watch 
two more birds emerge and hop along the branch, 
their tail feathers fluttering. They cock their heads 
in quick, jerky movements, like dogs staring at a 
treat. I forget myself and watch them move for a few 
minutes, my heart beating fast. It feels like I’ve been 
granted special access to a private zoo enclosure.


“I love them,” one New Haven resident, Mindy 
Roseman, tells me on the phone. “I came to visit the 
house five years ago, and there were parakeets in the 
tree. I thought, ‘my God, we’re moving to a trop­
ical paradise!’” When I ask her about the noise, she 
laughs and says, “You know, I-95 is only six blocks 
away. I’d rather hear bird sounds than the sound of 
motorcycles.”  


But Roseman acknowledges that she doesn’t speak 
for everyone in the neighborhood. Some people are 
openly fed up with the birds and their antics. “Par­
ticularly the old-timers,” she adds.
