EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
A couple weeks ago, I opened my phone to a 
voicemail left by one City Point resident, Earl Ben­
son, who preferred to use a pseudonym. “Leave a 
message at my house number, because I’m illiterate 
when it comes to texting and stuff of that sort.” His 
voice is slow and raspy, and he occasionally allows 
himself to wander from subject to subject, but he 
is succinct when it comes to the parakeets. “They 
are dangerous. I would be very much in favor of 
removing them.”

He has a point. For one thing, the four-hundred-
pound nests have been known to fall unexpectedly. 
“The largest nest recently fell off the tree, even after 
it survived the last wind storm,” City-Pointer Raquel 
Seacord wrote to me. “It was the size of a small car. 
Thankfully it fell on the street.” What’s more, the 
tropical birds like to nest near warm places, often 
on top of electrical transformer boxes at the top of 
utility poles, which has led to unexpected fires and 
power failures. 

“My real concern is that it would fall on some­
body or even kill somebody,” Benson tells me.  “I 
care more about human beings than parrots.” 

From 2005 to 2010, the utility company United 
Illuminating Co. (UI) and local Connecticut gov­
ernments jointly led a piecemeal campaign to rid 
the area of parakeets. Small bands of uniformed UI 
workers worked covertly to tear down the nests, 
often in the dead of night. They removed hundreds 
of nests from their utility poles and lighting fixtures, 
setting flocks of anxious birds loose, without the 
shelter they rely on to survive this far north. For 
good measure, UI workers also netted hundreds of 
parakeets and turned them over to the U.S. Depart­
ment of Agriculture for asphyxiation with carbon 
monoxide gas. But a public outcry spearheaded by 
the Darien-based animal rights group Friends of 
Animals—which included a threat to forego deco­
rating their homes with holiday lights—eventually 
put enough pressure on the company to stop the 
euthanizations.

Priscilla Feral has been president of Friends of 
Animals since 1987. She was a staunch advocate 
against United Illuminating, leading multiple law­
suits against the company. Fifteen years later, Feral 
still has an edge to her voice when she talks about 
UI. “I remember I was sitting at my desk,” she tells 
me, “and there’s a blizzard outside. The snow is 
blowing sideways, and they’re yanking nests down. 
It seemed draconian to me. It seemed especially 
heartless.” 

Feral has spent her life fighting for the rights of 
animals. “This company has contempt for [the par­
akeets],” she said in a 2008 interview, referring to 
UI. “They were compared to cockroaches and rats. 
They are keen on wiping them out of this environ­
ment.”


Earlier this year I was living in a house in Utah, 
when one night I woke up to find two mice scam­
pering across my bedspread. I jumped out of bed 
and turned on the light. They were fat and patchy, 
with wiry grey hair and naked pink tails that jerked 
back and forth as they scampered across the floor 
and squeezed themselves beneath the crack in my 
closet door. Revolted, trying to forget the image of 
the twitchy little rodents crawling over my pillow as 
I slept, I spent the rest of the night on the couch. The 
next morning, I steeled myself to open the closet 
door, and found that the mice had made a nest out of 
an assortment of random household items: shreds of 
newspaper, wood shavings, string, and a used tissue 
harvested from my bathroom trash can. 

On YouTube, there are hundreds of videos show­
ing cheap, DIY ways to deal with mice. You can 
drown them in bowls of water, trap them in plastic 
bottles, crush them beneath falling weights. After 
watching one video of five or six slicked-black mice 
slathered in peanut oil, struggling to climb up the 
smooth surface of a glass bowl, I realized I didn’t have 
the stomach for this. So I drove to the supermarket 
and found a Tomcat mousetrap—a minimalist black 
box advertising “Clean, no Touch Disposal!”—and 
checked the price on the back. Only $3.99.

Mice and parakeets both cause damage to prop­
erty, both inhabit spaces they aren’t meant for, both 
get in the way of regular human activity. But in 
Connecticut, mice are killed by the thousands, and 
parakeets galvanize a five-year conservation move­
ment. The explanation, as far as I can tell, is the same 
reason there’s a Connecticut Audubon Society but 
no Connecticut Arachnid Society. We put a pre­
mium on beauty—one animal has it, the other does 
not. This kind of selective compassion demonstrates 
itself all the time, in the pets we adopt and the foun­
dations to which we donate. A study conducted 
by Washington University, for example, found 
that participants more reflexively offered to donate 
money to aid traditionally beautiful animals—like 
koalas and giraffes—and felt happier when their 
money went to an attractive species than a needy 
species. 

There is also the question of whether an ani­
mal is “deserving” of its death, which, to my mind, 
refers to an animal’s direct responsibility for its own 
inconvenience. Cockroaches, rats, pigeons, squir­
rels—they’ve adapted to encroach on our space, and 
are therefore somehow implicated. But the para­
keets were brought here against their will. Should 
this matter? Do we owe an extra measure of pro­
tection to animals we’ve directly screwed over—like 
parakeets shipped across the ocean just to make our 
living rooms more colorful—than animals that made 
room for themselves? 

Of course, our calculus of life-valuation takes a 
host of other criteria into account: lifespan, expe­
rience of pain, evolutionary complexity, proxim­
ity to “humanness,” ecological importance. All this 
informs our decisions about which animals deserve 
to live. But when it comes to New Haven’s para­
keets, it seems clear that one element played the pri­
mary role in shaping public opinion.  

“[The parakeets] brought joy to people’s lives,” 
said Priscilla Feral. “They were treasured in a way 
that cockroaches are not treasured.”

Is it okay to kill an animal based on subjective 
measures of beauty? I don't know. But at the end 
of that line of reasoning remains the unavoidable 
reality of parakeet nests ripped down in the swirl­
ing snow, and panicked birds choking on carbon 
monoxide. That kind of senseless brutality is hard to 
look away from. 

But here my moralizing is almost beside the 
point. We’ve established a way of life that requires 
animals to die—to keep our homes infestation-free, 
to upholster our furniture, to fill the back orders at 
McDonalds. And especially within a culture that 
unironically features both doggy hairstylists and 
twenty-four-hour extermination companies, the 
decisions about which animals deserve to die, and 
which don’t, have a lot to do with the way they look.


Friends of Animals and local advocates were suc­
cessful in putting a stop to the parakeet  euthaniza­
tions. “We were able to capture the imagination of 
people outside the organization,” Priscilla Feral tells 
me. “They could not believe something so beautiful 
was subject to that kind of hostility.” Mindy Rose­
man seems to agree. “The way I see it, the parakeets 
are part of the great food chain of the planet. Live 
and let live, that’s my motto.” Now City Point and 
areas up and down the coast of Connecticut rever­
berate with the squawking of a thriving community 
of Monk Parakeets. 

I bought the mouse traps, three of them, and 
placed them against the wall outside the closet door. 
The next day, I woke to find two small brown lumps 
crammed inside. A thin, spaghetti tail drooped from 
one of them. Careful not to make contact, I picked 
up the traps and rushed them to the garbage can, 
tied up the bag and dropped it in the bin outside.
