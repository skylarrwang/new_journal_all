POEM
BÁT QUÁI (BAGUA MIRROR)
BY JOHN NGUYEN 
To my many siblings, the alive and lingering. 
He cooks sticky rice cakes, brings orchids
and forsythias in from the car, hangs that
octagonal golden charm on the front door
to ward off evil spirits—all in preparation
for the Lunar New Year. The house is clean,
though only in the living room. That’s okay,
guests won’t enter the others. While his baby
wails and he lulls her with shhh, the TV plays
in a tongue he has yet to tame: A 55-year-old
woman was punched to the ground in Chinatown.
A poppy bloomed on her nose—another bullet
point on a list longer than all rivers of a motherland.
It’s supposed to protect us, he tells his kids, who stare
at the just-hung, teal-eyed talisman. Then fireworks fly.                         Bang.
John Nguyen is a sophomore
in Davenport College.

EDGEWOOD AND EDGERTON PARKS
BY ELI MENNERICK 
East Rock and West Rock, the twin deities of New Haven parks, 
each have an attendant god. Just west of East Rock, across Whitney 
Avenue, is a park called Edgerton; four blocks south of West Rock is 
one named Edgewood. Edgerton is small, squarish, and manicured. 
It has tall stone walls, a greenhouse, a conservatory of exotic plants, a 
terrace with a fountain, and chickens. Eli Whitney’s niece once lived 
on the grounds in a mansion called Ivy Nook. Edgewood, mean­
while, is lanky, and sometimes overgrown. There is a skate park, and a 
dog park, and a duck pond. There are nice trails, particularly along the 
tiny, ruler-straight West River. Once, I saw the river teeming with 
hundreds of alewives, which swim from Long Island Sound into the 
West River to spawn. The water was low, and the fish flopped on top 
of one another, straining upstream.
