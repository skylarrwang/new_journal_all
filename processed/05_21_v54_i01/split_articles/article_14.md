2018. The pandemic exposed and exacerbated an 
existing hunger crisis in New Haven, as rising rates 
of poverty and unemployment resulted in smaller 
portions and more skipped meals.


To Grossi, although charities like Gather have a 
necessary role to play in fighting the crisis of food 
insecurity, mutual aid often has advantages over 
these more bureaucratic organizations. “Mutual 
aid is folks who are experiencing the unmet need 
working together to get those needs met,” she said. 
“[Charities] are constrained by red tape and bureau­
cracies”—to get food from charities, a person often 
needs to fill out federally mandated paperwork and 
supply an ID. “It's also very demoralizing to be on 
that end of having to prove that you both need this 
food and that you're worthy of it.”


Yet, without larger organizations like the Semilla 
Collective, which had the infrastructure necessary 
for distribution, Mutual Aid Growers would have 
had difficulty delivering their produce. As well, 
charities like Gather and IRIS provided Mutual Aid 
Growers with the necessary garden space for their 
seedlings. These organizations—both mutual aid 
and charity—work best when they work together.


In the future, Grossi, Dodge, and the rest of their 
team hope to continue providing food for those 
in need in New Haven. However, there are cur­
rently limits to how much this group can provide. 
Dodge told me, “Our group is small. We need a lot 
more volunteers. We need donations of seedlings, 
which we've been pretty lucky getting. But we 
could also use fertilizer. We could also use tomato 
cages.” Mutual Aid Growers has recently established 
a GoFundMe to bolster their network and fund­
ing. At the moment, most expenses come out of the 
pockets of volunteers. And a larger network means 
more backyards, more gardens, and more produce. 
 Of course, it is difficult to provide food for entire 
communities on single acre plots that do not sur­
vive the winter. But the gardens are a start. They 
are food sources, yes, but they are also a source of 
recreation, empowerment, stress relief, community 
bonding, and the opportunity to reclaim dominion 
over our diets from a corporate food system. And 
while walking through a neighborhood lined with 
grey sidewalks and chain link fences, it’s a nice break 
to stare into these gardens, watching tomatoes climb 
up a green stem.
