IN NOVEMBER OF 2020, a 
spider bit Glenda. Swollen and 
in pain, her finger began to 
necrotize. But she refused to visit 
the hospital. She’s a sex worker 
and drug user, and knew how 
she’d be treated there: security 
guards would accost her, confis­
cate her belongings, and strip her 
clothes. Phil Costello, a registered 
nurse practitioner and the Cli­
nical Director of Homeless Care 
at Cornell Scott - Hill Health 
center, urged her to go, to save 
her life, but when Glenda finally 
went, it was exactly as she feared. 
She felt judged and violated by 
doctors. So she left. After a few 
weeks, her finger had worsened 
to a point she could no longer 
bear, so she came back. She was 
lucky, doctors told her, that she 
only lost the pointer finger of her 
left hand. 

Most people wouldn’t think 
twice 
about 
seeking 
medical 
attention for a necrotizing finger. 
But Glenda was willing to risk her 
life to avoid it, signifying how the 
criminalization of sex work and 
its accompanying stigmatization 
make even the most basic protec­
tions difficult to access.

I met Glenda and five other 
women 
(Christine, 
Kimberly, 
Lindsay, Jasmine, and Lil’ Bit) at 
a Leadership Development Pro­
gram hosted by the Sex Workers 
and Allies Network (SWAN)—a 
harm-reduction organization that 
mostly services Fair Haven and 
distributes items like syringes, 
Narcan kits, safer sex supplies, and 
fentanyl test strips throughout the 
neighborhood. Since its founding 
in 2016, SWAN has worked clo­
sely with social service organiza­
tions in the area to connect sex 
workers to drug treatment faci­
lities or local shelters, and mem­
bers advocate for policy reforms 
like decriminalization. They also 
facilitate conversations with the 
police when sex workers want to 
file reports, and collaborate with 
local health providers to bring 
medical care directly to women 
on the street. They’re a kind of 
pillar in the community.

We met in a sparsely decorated 
room at New Reach, a non-pro­
fit organization in Fair Haven 
that supports housing insecure 
local families. Seats were placed 
in the formation of a large square, 
and we all sat so we could face 
one another. Beatrice Codianni, 
SWAN’s founder, organized the 
Leadership Development Program 
so that I would be able to talk to 
the organization’s members indi­
vidually. 

SWAN 
intentionally 
refers to the New Haven sex wor­
kers they service as their “mem­
bers” rather than their “clients” 
or “patrons.” I asked those pre­
sent in the room at New Reach 
what they considered the greatest 
threats to their safety. The res­
ponses ranged from the men they 
serviced (known as “dates”) to the 
harassment they received on the 
streets. They described robberies, 
drug usage, housing insecurity, 
and their lack of trust in resour­
ces such as the police or hospitals. 
These women are forced to con­
front danger in almost every facet 
of their daily lives. 

Beatrice, herself a former sex 
worker, established SWAN five 
years ago after watching a prosti­
tution sting in the neighborhoods 
of Fair Haven and Dwight-Ken­
sington. She was devastated by 
what she saw: fourteen women, 
between the ages of 24 and 59, 
staring down up to a year of jail 
time when, more than anything, 
they needed help. Beatrice knew 
sex work couldn’t be arrested 
away. Frustrated, she rallied with 
community activists to protest the 
sting operations, and they held 
demonstrations outside City Hall 
with signs that read “Sex work is 
real work” and “Stop the stings.” 
Beatrice went down to the police 
station and insisted on talking to 
then-police chief Anthony Cam­
pbell. She explained to him that 
sting operations were harmful and 
would never stop what they pur­
portedly set out to. Eventually, 
he agreed with her, promised to 
call them off, and his successors 
in the department have kept his 
word. Since that early settlement, 
SWAN has grown into one of the 
only organizations in Connecti­
cut that sex workers can come to 
when they need care.

Christine, who is the daughter 
of a retired police officer, des­
cribed to me how her drug usage 
threatened her life, explaining that 
she is an active heroin addict. She 
also mentioned the danger posed 
by dates. Lindsay echoed the sen­
timent. 

“You don’t know what’s going 
to happen,” Lindsay added. “Some 
people are really crazy.”

Jasmine agreed, saying that the 
greatest threats to her safety were 
“creepy ass men,” and that she also 
sometimes worried about stickup 
kids robbing her after they thou­
ght she’d been on a date.

When I asked Lil’ Bit the same 
question regarding threats to her 
safety, she immediately named the 
police. 

“I just feel like they’re very jud­
gemental, especially if you have a 
past history or a record,” she said. 
She wouldn’t go to them if she 
needed help. “Especially if they 
look your name up and see your 
history. If you’re a drug addict or 
prostitute, forget about it. You’re 
not a human. You’re just some, 
you know, junkie. If you’re in a 
situation or predicament, they feel 
as if it was your fault.”

THE  NEW  JOURNAL
Because of the criminal 
status of their labor, sex 
workers in the United States 
have struggled to effectively 
organize to defend them­
selves against exploitation.

Kimberly, who said that dates 
were the largest threat to her 
safety as well, quickly shook her 
head when I asked if she would 
feel comfortable going to the 
police if she were harmed. Most of 
the women had the same reaction. 
“They’re just too judgemen­
tal,” Kimberly said. “Very judge­
mental. I don’t trust them ‘cause 
there was a cop out there who was 
raping women, too.”

Kimberly was referring to Gary 
Gamarra, a former member of 
the New Haven Police Depart­
ment who was accused of sexua­
lly assaulting two sex workers 
after serving as an officer in Fair 
Haven for four years. Gamarra 
resigned in December 2020. An 
Internal Affairs report, obtained 
in April 2021 by the New Haven 
Independent, details months of 
investigation into the allegations. 
Both women, who have remained 
anonymous, told investigators that 
they felt they had no choice but to 
have sex with Gamarra due to his 
position as a police officer. But at 
first, they were reluctant to come 
forward. 

“They didn’t think we would 
listen to them,” Captain David 
Zannelli told me. Zannelli is in 
his seventeenth year of law enfor­
cement and oversees the Internal 
Affairs unit of the New Haven 
Police Department. He emphasi­
zed that he and his detectives did 
everything they could to get the 
victims’ statements anyway, and 
they had Beatrice’s help, because 
the two women were SWAN 
members. 

When Gamarra was confronted 
with evidence, according to the 
IA report on the investigation, he 
burst into tears, said that he had 
“fucked up,” and shared a version 
of the events that was almost iden­
tical to what both women shared 
independently. The only discre­
pancy was that Gamarra claimed 
the sex was consensual. 

Gamarra’s admission was good 
enough for Internal Affairs, but 
not for the State’s Attorney’s 
Office, which, for now, has deci­
ded not to press criminal charges 
against him due to a lack of pro­
bable cause. Beatrice and her team 
at SWAN vehemently oppose this 
decision, but Zannelli acknowle­
dges that the physical evidence 
is not in their favor. At times, it 
was difficult to corroborate the 
victims’ stories because they had 
changed them or forgotten details. 

Gamarra 
has 
an 
upcoming 
decertification hearing with Con­
necticut’s Police Officer Standards 
and Training Council, where the 
NHPD may bar him from serving 
as a police officer in the state. The 
process is long and tedious, pos­
sibly taking many months until a 
hearing is held. 

The Attorney’s Office’s refusal 
to press charges hasn’t helped the 
already tense relationship between 
New Haven sex workers and the 
police. The women often feel 
that they won’t be taken seriously 
when filing claims because they 
aren’t perfect victims, and the 
Attorney’s Office’s decision has 
reconfirmed that to them. 

Stigma pervades the hazardous 
relationship between sex workers 
and police, even as members of 
law enforcement, like Zannelli, 
work to mend that dynamic. A 
2020 joint report by Yale’s Global 
Health Justice Partnership (GHJP) 
and SWAN titled “Mistreatment 
and Missed Opportunities” sur­
veyed forty-nine New Haven sex 
workers, and found that 83 per­
cent of respondents believed that 
they have been stigmatized or 
disrespected by police. 89 percent 
of respondents had been incarce­
rated at some point—sex workers 
are often charged with crimes 
related to  homelessness, drug 
use, and the sex work itself, such 
as loitering, trespassing, and pos­
session. Having a criminal record 
can make it harder to find housing 
or alternate forms of employment, 
which traps sex workers in a cycle; 
they may not be able to leave the 
industry even if they’d like to. 

Beatrice cited incidents relayed 
to her by SWAN members that 
echoed the findings of the sur­
vey, in which police have suppo­
sedly said that sex workers can’t be 
raped, or that their stories aren’t 
credible because the women may 
have been using drugs at the time.  

While some women told me 
they were comfortable going to 
the police and some said they were 
comfortable seeing doctors, all of 
them had experiences in which 
they felt uncomfortable when 
trying to access services that did 
not fully cater to their particular 
needs as sex workers. 

Christine told me that she has 
been raped before, but was never 
able to bring herself to get a rape

kit done or file a report with 
the police. Just talking about it 
is hard for her. “A few times I 
tried to share with a few people, 
and nobody wants to listen,” she 
said. “Or they don’t believe you 
anyways, so [you] just swallow 
it,” she said. “I’ve had women 
cry on my lap and give me every 
utmost detail of rape or 
assault, and I’m writing 
everything down. I can’t 
do that. I’m not that 
brave.”

That feeling of iso­
lation and distrust is 
fueled by policy crimi­
nalizing sex work, says 
Alice Miller. She is an 
adjunct associate profes­
sor at Yale Law School, 
assistant clinical profes­
sor at the Yale School of 
Public Health, and the 
co-director of the Glo­
bal Health Justice Part­
nership, a research and 
advocacy-oriented orga­
nization that operates at 
the intersection of health 
and justice. Miller has 
been working with sex 
worker 
organizations 
around the country for 
the past twenty-five to 
thirty years and has seen 
first-hand how crimina­
lization feeds stigma, and 
how stigma leads to ina­
dequate social support, 
especially in the case of 
labor rights. Because of 
the criminal status of their labor, 
sex workers in the United States 
have struggled to effectively orga­
nize to defend themselves against 
exploitation. Progress has been 
made in the past five to ten years 
as sex workers have increased their 
visibility, but this has not eradica­
ted the barriers to security that sex 
workers face.

“What makes people safer in 
strawberry picking or christmas 
tree farming—which have been 
big areas of exploitation—is their 
ability to organize and work lega­
lly in a country,” Miller said. “The 
safer you are from the predation 
of the law, the more able you are 
to organize with others to protect 
your rights.” 

Viewing sex work through a 
labor rights lens shifts the terms 
of 
policy 
discussions, 
Miller 
explained. She emphasized that 
human trafficking—which poli­
cymakers often conflate with sex 
work itself—can take place in 
any industry. Human trafficking 
occurs when individuals are coer­
ced into performing labor, and it 
can happen anywhere that wor­
kers have insufficient legal protec­
tions in the event of abuse. In the 
strawberry industry, for example, 
migrant agricultural workers on 
farms in Spain and California have 
described 
poor 
compensation, 
dangerous working con­
ditions, and the threat 
of deportation if they 
ever retaliated against 
employers. “If you are 
disempowered, if you 
can’t organize, if you 
can’t tell people what 
you’re doing, and if you 
can’t leave what you’re 
doing—if all of those 
things are true, then you 
are at risk of being tra­
fficked,” Miller said.

Another danger ari­
sing from the confla­
tion of sex work and 
trafficking has been the 
FOSTA-SESTA (Fight 
Online Sex Trafficking 
Act-Stop Enabling Sex 
Traffickers Act) laws, 
ostensibly intended to 
hold websites accoun­
table for allowing ads 
featuring 
trafficked 
children. But according 
to 
Karolina 
Ksiazek, 
SWAN’s 
Director 
Advocacy, the law was 
written with such broad 
language that it essen­
tially made it illegal for 
any website to support prostitu­
tion in any way. This included 
banning websites that sex workers 
used to keep themselves safe, such 
as forums where they could warn 
each other about dangerous dates. 
Because of FOSTA-SESTA, it’s 
harder for sex workers to screen 
clients and negotiate before mee­
ting them. Even something as
