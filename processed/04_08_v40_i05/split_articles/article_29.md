Cut out of newsprint like a ransom 
note, the words sprawl across the top of 
the page. Below lies a large black and white 
photograph of a young, pale-skinned man 
wearing nothing but a garland. His lips 
shine; his pelvis thrusts forward in bold 
display. There's no getting around the 
focus of the picture: The penis, standing 
proud at center stage. 

I furtively scan the Beinecke reading 
room: Has anyone looked up from his 
medieval manuscripts? The coast is clear. 
I look back down to read the last words 
pasted on the page. 
~come on in, Sucker." 
WELCOME TO PAGE ONE OF THE SCRAP-
books of Carl Van Vechten, luminary of 
the twentieth century New York arts scene 
- and notorious provocateur. The foremost 
white patron of the Harlem Renaissance, 
he brought Langston Hughes and Zora 
Neale Hurston to publishers and white 
tourists to Harlem in the 1920s and 30s. 
Equal parts patron and partier. "Carlo" 
knew everyone and everyone came to his 
parties. One of the best-connected people 
of his era, he has also been one of the most 
neglected in its recent historical memory. 
Pitches like "Come 
say HELLO to a GOOD 
BUY.", 
"You'll like it!", 
and "Just taste this new 
kind!" become the sly 
subtitles to pictures of 
naked men. 

VAN VECHTEN'S SCRAPBOOKS, HOWEVER, 
are reviving his legacy in ways no one 
anticipated. The books arrived at Yale, 
packed in three mysterious cartons bearing 
strict instructions not to be opened until 
25 years after his death, which occurred 
in 1964. Patricia Willis, the soft-spoken 
curator of American literature at the Bei-
necke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, 
remembers when the albums were still a 
mystery. "They were in the stacks with 
rope around them that said 'restricted.'" 
she says. As the 25-year mark drew near, 
scholars assumed they were about to un-
veil Van Vechten's diaries. "They said, 'Of 
course, this is going to be exciting, and 
let's open those journals and have a party,' 
and the curator said, 'Well, I don't think 
so...' It was a good instinct." The few 
people who did attend the 1989 opening, 
including Willis, were shocked by what 
they found: 18 scrapbooks of graphic ho-
moeroticism, full of mischief and devoid 
of explanation. 

THE SCRAPBOOKS TAKE VAN VECHTEN'S 
legendarily wicked humor to an outra-
geous new level. He had a knack for the 
fiendish double entendre, turning other-
wise innocent phrases into cheeky cap-
tions for his images of conspicuous erec-
tions: "Such fine Wares at Low Prices!" 
"Learn to sip, not guzzle." He reveled in 
the seductive tone of twentieth century 
advertising. Pitches like "Come say 'HEL-
LO' to a GOOD BUY!", "You'll like it!", 
and "Just taste this new kind!" become the 
sly subtitles to pictures of naked men. He 
was especially fond of ads in the second 
person, wielding an aggressively intimate 
"you" that makes the viewer feel strangely 
complicit in his vice. 

Van Vechten collected newspaper clip-
pings chronicling Harlem drag balls, early 
sex-change operations ("GI Who Turned 
Woman is a Happy Beauty"), court cases 
for "morals charges," and abuse incidents. 
He assembled more restrained, if still the-
atrical, black and white photographs of 
male nudes, both Caucasian and African 
American, which most scholars think are 
mostly or entirely the work of Van Vech-
ten. Nothing escaped him: Photos of 
ambiguously homoerotic Greek vases, la-
beled in childishly rounded handwriting, 
nestle against newspaper cuttings of male 
wrestlers locked in combat. 

But as we—librarians, art historians, 
gender studies scholars, and the casual 
Beinecke browser—try to understand the 
Van Vechten behind these irreverent col-
lages, we must confront the darker side of 
the scrapbooks. First, a persistent strain of 
pedophilia. "Do you want a baby?" says a 
clipping next to a photograph of an ado-
lescent boy wearing nothing but Greek 
lace-up sandals; on another page, two boys 
hold each other's erections. There is also a 
troubling strain of racism. A young, tall 
blond leers down at a shorter black boy, 
who grins broadly as he grips the other's 
shoulders proprietarily; one of its four 
captions reads, "In identifying meat, color 
is our best guide." Another page shows a 
French soldier sodomizing an Arab boy. 
Such scenes, numerous and shockingly 
extreme, are impossible to dismiss. They 
threaten to crumble an already shaky un-
derstanding of a complex man. 

VAN VECHTEN, SCHOLARS SPECULATE, 
compiled the scrapbooks between the 
1930s and the 1950s. Participating in a 
trend of scrapbook sharing, he probably 
passed them around and received clip-
ping contributions from a small and co-
vert circle of friends. Since going public, 
the scrapbooks have gathered enough of 
a cult following among academics that 
they're beginning to fall apart; they flaked 
as I turned the pages. Still, their current 
audience, like the first, remains small 
and under the radar. The albums form a 
mere fraction of the legacy of a man who 
worked tirelessly to preserve the cultural 
artifacts of his era and to showcase its 
biracialism. A fervent believer in cultural 
cross-pollination, Van Vechten convinced 
his white artist friends to leave their col-
lections to Fisk, a historically African 
American university in Nashville, and 
his black friends to donate their papers 
to Yale's own Beinecke, thereby creat-
ing the treasured James Weldon Johnson 
collection. 

Van Vechten had a keen sense of his 
own role in history. He purposefully made 
himself an indispensable commercial and 
cultural link between Harlem and white 
New York. Jennifer Wood, the effusive 
dean of Ezra Stiles College and Yale's in-
house expert on the scrapbooks, argues 
that the Harlem Renaissance would not 
have occurred as it did without him. "He 
really brought the power of the white 
publishing houses to the Harlem Renais-
sance," she explains. "And that shaped it, 
for better or worse." 

In the 1960s, when the Harlem Renais-
sance came back in vogue, historians tried 
to forget Van Vechten, and, with him, the 
uncomfortable role of whites in the move-
ment. In the past decade, however, he has 
reappeared in academia. "He speaks to 
some issues that we're working on now," 
Wood explains, "in terms of white fasci-
nation with black culture and the many 
ramifications that can have." 

The scrapbooks lie at the heart of 
the Van Vechten dilemma, forcing us 
to consider how prejudice, even if un-
conscious, played in this cross-racial 
pioneer. While he was exchanging long, 
frequent letters with Langston Hughes, 
he was also collecting typewritten poems—scanned 
from the newspaper 
clippings in his scrapbooks—full of 
sexual sing-song rhymes unprintably of-
fensive toward blacks. Even as his pri-
vate scrapbook snapshots betray his erotic and 
exotic fascination with black bodies, 
his public photographs of black artists, 
musicians, and writers show a profound 
respect for and will to document Afri-
can American artistic production. These 
scrapbooks may be the last frontier of Van 
Vechten's persona, a dangerous landscape 
that tempts scholars to put it in unopen-
able boxes and return to the "Carlo" they 
knew and loved. 

Wood, who is writing her disserta-
tion on Van Vechten, knows firsthand 
the difficulty of verbalizing the contents 
of the books. "Nothing can prepare 
you 
for sitting down with them," she says. 
Most scholars don't even try. Yale's own 
Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
studies website describes the collections as 
"a lighthearted, ironic comment on ho-
mosexual men, lesbians, and masculinity 
and femininity." Jonathan Weinberg, who 
wrote one of the first pieces of scholarship 
about the scrapbooks, a 1994 article titled 
"Boy Crazy," celebrates how Van Vechten 
"found homosexuality where homosexu-
ality had been suppressed... and he found 
homosexuality where it was not supposed 
to be." Yet Weinberg fails to mention race 
throughout the first half of the essay, and 
by the end of the twenty-five-page article 
the issue seems almost forgotten. The im-
ages reproduced from the scrapbooks usu-
ally show only photographs of whites or 
the least offensive images of blacks. Con-
fronted with elements incongruous to a 
well-respected historical figure, scholars 
have chosen to turn away.


"It's hard to say what 
he actually felt about 
really anything," Wood 
confesses. "He has 
his tongue firmly placed 
in his cheek at all times." 

Wood agrees that academia has down-
played the most disturbing aspects of the 
books, focusing instead on their straight-
forward, easily celebrated components. 
Scholars have seized on the albums as an 
obsessively meticulous record of gay his-
tory, a discipline in which many docu-
ments have been lost or destroyed. "The 
archive in its own right is stunning," says 
Wood. "I mean it's one of the best, if not 
the best... of this period." Combined with 
the Fisk and James Weldon Johnson col-
lections, the scrapbook archive cements 
Van Vechten's place as an invaluable his-
torian. Art historians, meanwhile, have 
concentrated on the less pornographic, 
more aestheticized nude portraits, those 
that coincide with Van Vechten's image as 
a praiseworthy photographer. 

Some scholars avoid the albums entirely. 
"There are twenty books about him from 
the last twenty years that do not mention 
the scrapbooks at all," Wood says. "There 
are people who are really steering away 
from them." One of the reasons scholars 
may shirk from interpreting the scrap-
books is that, in his life and work, Van 
Vechten remained stubbornly unreadable. 
"It's hard to say what he actually felt about 
really anything," Wood confesses. "He has 
his tongue firmly placed in his cheek at 
all times." 

In a few months, Willis plans to launch 
an exhibit of Van Vechten's relatively 
unknown color photographs of African 
American artists. This show is intended 
to broaden perceptions of Van Vechten, 
but no images from the scrapbooks will 
be included. 

In 2006, scholar James M. D'Addario opened 
the scrapbooks to an in-depth discussion 
of race. In a book titled *The Homophile 
Photography of Carl Van Vechten*, D'Addario 
argues that Van Vechten "needed" the bi-
racial element of the scrapbooks to justify 
both his erotic interest in African Ameri-
cans and his faith in cultural interracial-
ism. This explanation seems inadequate 
given the aggressive and unhesitating 
nature of Van Vechten's racial erotica. 
The argument also neglects the fact that 
the albums, though private during Van 
Vechten's lifetime, were eventually meant 
to go public. 

"There's a bit of social engineering, 
there's a little bit of control in everything 
he does," says Wood. "Whatever his per-
sonal feelings, Van Vechten never forgot 
about his public image." Still, D'Addario hits 
something at the heart of the scrapbooks. 
Just as Van Vechten might have "needed" 
the scrapbooks to see his own life in a cer-
tain way, every viewer sees in them what 
he or she needs to see. Some see a simple 
historical archive, others a celebrated 
point in the history of gay rights, and still 
others an aesthetic contribution to pho-
tography. Van Vechten, the consummate 
manipulator, has become the object of 
our own manipulations. 

When I view the scrapbooks, I squirm 
at Van Vechten's assumed license to cross 
and re-cross the racial line. He would 
have underestimated just how unaccept-
able such an attitude would seem in 2008. 
Wood characterizes Van Vechten as un-
derstanding himself as being able to tran-
gress racial boundaries. "...he felt he had 
some sort of special dispensation to speak 
for and about African Americans." He is, 
Wood says, "a projector of Elvis Presley 
and Eminem, what have you. People have 
this white character who's going to talk 
about race as an insider in some way." I 
once researched Van Vechten's notorious 
1926 novel *Nigger Heaven*. Its handy 
"insider's" view of Harlem life. While the 
book projects an innocent disregard for 
its own problematic nature, there is some-
thing knowing in its ability to capture 
the reader's reluctant fascination. While 
much of Harlem railed against it, as his-
torian Michael S. Millner writes in "Activism 
in the Harlem Renaissance," his 2002 
essay, it was the number one read on the 
reserve list at a Harlem branch of the New 
York Public Library. Everyone read it 
in 
private. When I read *Nigger Heaven* four 
years ago, I was ashamed to be seen with 
it, and I felt disgusted by it. But I have 
remained fascinated by its author. 

Poring over my Beinecke loot, I think 
that perhaps Van Vechten was right to ad-
dress his scrapbook viewers as "you." My 
fascination makes me feel as complicit in 
the making of the albums as the people 
who sent their sexual poems to "Carlo." 
Wood calls Van Vechten "ironic"—he 
certainly planned for the albums to cause 
a scandal. "Yale may not think so, but I'll 
be just jolly," he promises on one page. 
"Carl had a penchant for shocking peo-
ple," says Willis. He would have loved to 
see me fidget in my stuffy Beinecke chair.
