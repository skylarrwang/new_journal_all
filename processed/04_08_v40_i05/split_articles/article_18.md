**Title: The Yale-ification of York Square**
**Author: Sarah Engel**

Dan Jeanerte, a New Haven native, ace 
at the Doodle ac lease once a week dur-
ing his four years of high school. He sees 
the coffee shop's closing as part of the 
ongoing transformation of York Square. 
"Yale seems to be striving to create more 
of a 'college rown' feel where shops stay 
open later and the general vibe is geared 
towards the college clientele," he nores. 
Although Jeanette recognizes the benefits 
ofYale-sponsored urban development, he 
also points out that "some of this change 
has been ro the detriment of long-stand-
ing businesses. Barrie Ltd. Shoes, York 
Square Cinemas, and now the Doodle 
have all closed down." While new busi-
nesses like J. Crew and Au Bon Pain may 
have revitalized the area, they "don't have 
any history behind them." 
"Jm not as good as I 
used to be, "says the re-
tired competitive eater. 
"My time has passed. " 
NOT ALL LOCALS ARJ! SENTIMENTAL ABOlTf 
the Doodle's closing. Storbierski has only 
casually followed the story in the Ntw 
Havrn &gisttr and he doesn't intend to 
become involved in the cause to "Save the 
Doodle!" "I'm working two jobs and re-
ally don't have the spare time to try and 
help out," he says. 
According to Paul Cuticcllo, the owner 
of Paul Richards, an old-timey neighbor-
ing shoe store, local Doodle activists are 
less prominent than Yale-affiliated ones. 
Even some Yalies who never set foot in the 
Doodle are rallying behind the little diner. 
Sophomore Marissa Grunes, who never 
ate at the Doodle, is nonetheless a member 
of the "Save the Doodle" Facebook group. 
Another group member, sophomore Brit-
tany Golob, articulates what artracts her 
to the diner's cause: "Traditions like cups 
and hanging out at Naples or Yorks ide or 
Yankee Doodle speak of ... what we do 
now that connects us to Yale's past." 
Perhaps students who are up in arms 
about the fall of a shoebox restaurant 
whose threshold they never crossed are 
simply appropriating another tradition 
that does not belong to them, just as 
Yale's 1920s architects appropriated Cam-
bridge's spires and gothic rowers. Even 
students who claim ro reject Ivy League 
• 
elitism nostalgically embrace Yale's ma-
terial tradition. For these srudents, rhe 
Doodle represents a New Haven before · c 
cheap Chinese food or Srarbucks. It stands 
for a time when twelve sears were enough 
and when trans fats didn't have a name. 
It sirs around rhe corner from J.Press, an-
other bastion of "Old Yale" nostalgia, but 
it seems that no number of oxford shirrs, 
cufflinks, milkshakes, or cheeseburgers 
will bring back the good old days. 
But perhaps the good old days-or our 
imagined version of them-are not worth 
preserving. After all, the idealization of 
"Old Yale" that the Doodle can inspire is 
not unproblematic. Grunes imagines the 
diner of yesteryear as "the classless little 
place that classy people would patronize, 
where the proprietor is behind the coun-
ter, and you know his name and he knows 
yours ... and then of course you leave and 
become a high-power Yale man and remi-
nisce fondly, but that's pretty much the 
end of the love story." 


SO, WHY SAVE TiiE DOODLE? MAYBE STO-
bierski's thoughts on his own career ap-
ply to the outdated diner as well. "I'm not 
as good as I used to be," says the retired 
competitive eater, whose second record 
was surpassed in 2003. "My time has 
passed." 
Still, maybe we want to save a vision 
of ourselves as old-time, scholarly Elis 
immune to grease and gentrification. 
As one terribly literary hyGate blogger 
wrote, mourning rhe los_~ of the Doodle 
Ivy-wide, ~I can totally imagine Franny or 
Seymour hanging our there!"
