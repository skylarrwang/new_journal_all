DICKIE M'D I ARJ! FLIPPJ:-;G THROUGH A." 
old edition of Playboy when his next cus-
tomer comes in. I stan with embarrass-
ment as the door to Dickie's second floor 
atdier opens. but he continue~ poring 
over the pornography. He turns a glossy 
page with his right hand while bc:ckoning 
with the other to the middle-aged \\"Oman 
arriving for a rrim. 
"Take a seat over ht:re and Nancy will 
give you a wash," he sap, and in the same 
breath a:.ks me to guess the identity of one 
panicularly buxom bunny. Though I'm 
usually prepared for pop quazzcs, this isn't 
really my subject. 
"That's Pamela Anderson, right there, 
before she had any work done. What a 
natural beauty." He rutfles through a cou-
ple more pages of the 1995 issue, which 
features an Ivy League ~pread showing 
off ~exy Yale girls posing provOCltively on 
Cross Campus. He arrhes at his destina· 
cion and points to a brunette on a love 
seat. "She's a former client!" 

DICKU, WHOSE REAL SAME IS CAETANO 
Ferriuolo, is the owner of The Workshop, 
a small, second-story hair salon on Cha-
pel !'itrttt couched bernren Book Trader 
Cafe and Thai Pan Asian. 'I he New Haven 
native anJ former hippie is an expert in 
curls. 

Young Dickie shm\ed no signs of be-
ing a fUture hair parlor prodigy. He 
didn't cut his ~iblings' hair, nor did he 
style hb stuffed animals. He did, however, 
grow up with severe dyslexia-a disorder 
he credits for his skilled hands. "It's like 
being blind-you can hear bener. I used 
v.hat I had," says Dickie, \\ho preferred 
ro gct thrown out of class rather than 
rc:otd aloud. 

Though Dickie now ~ms a natural-. 
born stylist, he didn't choose his calling. 
Rather, a juvenile court did, after Dickie 
dropped out of high school with several 
friends to become a bookie. "We were 
any mother's dream," he jokes. He took 
bets on local sporting events until he ·was 
17, when he was arrested for bookmak· 
ing. The p.uh to curl connoisseurship was 
born in court. "You have to tell the judge 
you're doing something with your life. So 
my la\W}'er said, 'Tell them you're going to 
go to barber college,' and the judge actu· 
ally made me go." 

After receiving his barber's license, 
Dickie went straight ro work. His "hands 
of gold," as he refers to them, were an im-
mediate success. Dickie had clients lin-
ing up outside his shop waiting for their 
rurn in the hot seat before he was old 
enough to buy the PlAyboy whose bunnies 
he would one day style. "I was a tender 
young boy-just the kind you like," the 
tirelessly bawdy Dickie says, giving my 
knee a playfUl tap. 

As Dickie's body matured, so did his 
professional interests. "All the pretty 
girls were going to hairdre~r school, so 
I decided to go to hairdresser school," he 
tells me. After graduation, his career sky-
rocketed. He went from trimming New 
Haven's most coveted coiffeur's hair to 
working at his salon. Soon he was in New 
York City. employed by a Fifth Avenue 
salon-a place so stylish that all of its em-
ployees had stage names. Dickie went by 
:...iister Dick.

SOOS IT WAS THE SIXTIES. "I ENDED UP 
with some genius non-conformists," says 
Dickie, who later found himself hanging 
'"'ith a Studio 54 crowd. One of the in· 
novators with whom Dickie worked was 
Paul Mirchdl, whose brand is still king 
u upscale hair salons. "We were the first 
ones to reallv cut hair," he declares.

Though a srylist who an handle unruly

"I've never been known not to ha\'e per-

hcar1>. I knew more about his lo~e life by 
the end of my fir.st visit to his studio than

drew even as a barber fresh out of \OCl·

him worry about an economic m:ession, 
D1ckie, who works Just thrc:c: cbys a wc:c:k

about a m:ession of passion.
