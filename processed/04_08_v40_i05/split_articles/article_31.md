most prenatal, too translucent, wrinkled, 
and small for this world. Her eyes droop 
closed, and she: looks like a Victorian im-
ag.: of death, pcacdul and asleep, as if her 
Â· time on earth were just a brief, harmless 
dream. Dr. Grau checks for a heartbeat. 
"Okay. she's gone," she: murmurs. ''I'm so 
sorry." Mason lowers his head and gravity 
take. over. The tears roll down his cheeks. 
Dr. Grau asks if he wantS to spend 
more time with Dusty's still-warm body. 
"No, no," Mason mumbles, wiping his 
eyes and sniffling. 
"It's not weird." Dr. Grau says, pierc-
ing the: mange: air of transition from fam-
ily member to dead animal that fills the 
room. 
"I know, I know," Mason says a bit 
defensively. "But I'm fine." He lifts his 
baseball cap up and down a few times and 
trudges down the hallway to the exit. 
Downstairs, Dr. Grau lays Dusty on a 
stainless steel table. "The cremation ser-
vice does a pick-up once a day," she says, 
and then walks away. With Dr. Grau 
gone:, I run my hand over Dusty. "It's not 
weird," I think, and feel relieved. 

THE SEXT DAY, A CAT SCREAMS FOR HIS UFE. 
Mr. O'Brien and his 
11-year-old 
daughter, Isabelle:, stand in the check-up 
room. As o;oon as Dr. Grau enters, Isabelle 
startS bawling fiercely. Kitten sits on the 
table. He: is a Halloween cat, his black fur 
so lustrous and dark it appears a siJvery 
blue as it catches the light, and his eyes 
are rwo large yellow globes. He looks alert 
and vigorous. 
Owners have several choices to make 
when putting down a pet: Whether or not 
to be present for the euthanasia, whether 
to cremate the body or take it home to 
bury. Bodies can be cremated individually 
and returned. or cremated co masse. 
As Isabelle: continues to sob, Mr. 
O'Brien delivers his family's answer: 
They don't want to be prc:sent for Kitten's 
death, bur they do want his body to bury 
at home:. "I just \'\o"ant to let you know, I 
treat each animal like it's my own," Dr. 
Grau sap as she scoops up Kitten. 
In the hubbub of the open ER down-
stairs, a few nurses offer Kitten some cat 
food in a red and white cardboard con-
tainer, a miniature version of the contain-
ers Cape Cod restaurants use to serve fried 
cLams or steamers. Kitten .sniffs the: food 
April2008 
and rurns away. "Oh come on, it's your 
last meal!" Dr. Grau begs. Kitten refuses. 
"Shhhh, pretty baby, it's okay," Linda 
coos as she holds Kitten's body down. Dr. 
Grau insertS the needle, and suddenly 
Kitten spits and screams. Not a howl or a 
hiss or any other word we use to describe 
non-human noises, but a real scream, ee-
rily high-pitched and otherworldly. He 
fights to rum his head back to his leg. 
where DL Grau is pushing the liquid 
through the needle. His body shakes. Fi-
nally, he goes limp. 
Dr. Grau and Linda look weary. I am 
shocked. Trudy picks up the body. "Now, 
don't you dace pee: on me!" Trudy warns 
as her under five-foot frame struggles to 
carry Kitten's weight. "Trudy, he's not go-
ing to pee on you!" Linda says, leaning 
on the metal operating table. "Oh, yeah," 
Trudy chuckles, heaving Kitten's body 
into a cardboard box. "I forgot." Kitten's 
head flops over the side of the box. Trudy 
pushes it back in. 

WHEN I WAS IN SECOND GRADE, MY PAR-
ents got a divorce. In retaliation, I gave an 
ultimatum to my mom: We get a dog or 
I get my ears pierced. I wanted a dog-
more than an-y-thing--but if the answer 
was no, as it had been for months and 
months, I just had to do somahing. 
This tactic did not budge her, so I threw 
a fit. I cried and cried and grew hysterical 
until finally I quieted down, and said, in 
the argument my mom still recalls as the 
one that shifted the tide, "Mama. You arc 
thinking of this dog as just a burden. But 
the truth is, you will love her, and then 
she won't feel like a burden ac all." I of-
fered my own presence in her life as an 
example. 
I brought Marilla into our lives, and 
though I still love her dearly, she now 
matters more to my mom than to me. I 
am about to graduate college, and I feel 
on the cusp of my adult life. Marilla is at 
home. 
After her surgery, Dr. Grau sent a chunk 
of Marilla's excised rumor to a specialist. 
It was malignant. A rough prognosis gives 
Marilla another four months; with che-
motherapy, perhaps a year. 
When I am home for dinner one night, 
Marilla rc:scs her chin on my feec under 
the table. We arc trying to weigh, as a fam-
ily, the pain of chemotherapy for Marilla 
against our own desire to have her around 
for as long as we can. And, of course, we 
cannot consult her in the decision. I lean 
down, stroke her ear, and her tail whaps 
against the dle floor. Her wishes are only 
as we imagine them. 
All I can firmly glean from my time at 
the Animal Hospital is that I want to be 
there when Marilla is cuthaniz.ed. I don't 
care what happens to her body.
