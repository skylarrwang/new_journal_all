FLAGS TO RICHES 
Anyone who has driven along the Gover-
nor John Davis Lodge Turnpike, the seg-
ment of I-95 that hugs the New Haven 
harbor for several miles before abruptly 
veering off toward Mystic, is sure to have 
spotted a row of trucks and vans with gau-
dy, spray-painted monikers like “Sweeney’s” 
and “Mixtapa.” The gritty entrepre-
neurs who own and operate these mobile 
lunch-counters have served the same burri-
tos and hot dogs to the same customers—
truckers en route to Providence or Bos-
ton—for years. But one vehicle stands out 
from the rest: a 1988 Chevy van decked 
with flags that flutter noisily in the coastal 
breeze. For years, this van has piqued the 
curiosity of school-bound Yale students 
and homeward-bound suburbanites with 
its array of banners and plastic signs reading 
“Flag Man” and “Since 1991.” Funky 
and vanilla-colored, the vehicle might well 
have had a past life as an ice-cream truck. 
Its peeling paint and growing sheen of 
rust, meanwhile, suggest that its current 
life is drawing to a close. 


Bill Shields, the owner of the van, has 
the rugged build of a former linebacker. 
His appearance is unkempt, his voice 
slightly dopey, but he is surprisingly elo-
quent on the subject of flags. For the last 
twenty years, he has eked out a living 
selling them out of the back of his van. 
On any given day he sells between five 
and twenty, emblazoned with patterns as 
diverse as the Red Sox 
insignia, the Star 
Spangled Banner, and the ever-popular 
skull and crossbones. The income he gen-
erates may be small by Wall Street stan-
dards, but it is sufficient for his needs. 


Selling flags used to be a part-time 
gig. For years, Shields worked at one of 
many American printing companies that 
went out of business in the early nineties. 
April 2008 
When he felt as if the entire industry were 
being shipped overseas in the late eigh-
ties, Shields, a self-proclaimed history buff, 
took to selling patriotic bumper stickers, 
license plates, and flags on the side. His 
first sale was an Irish tricolor at a flea 
market in Milford. To this day, the pat-
tern continues to be a top seller, thanks in 
large part to Saint Patrick’s Day. “It’s the 
Catholic countries,” he says, “who boast 
the most national pride. The country with 
the least, judging by its flag purchases, is 
France. 


In the mid-nineties, Shields severed 
ties with the commercial printing indus-
try and devoted himself full time to his 
tiny roadside business, which started 
to thrive once he discovered “Madison 
Avenue”—his nickname for the lot on 
Wharf Drive across from the New Haven 
Register headquarters. This location saves 
him money on advertising: people notice 
him when they pass on the highway 
and later return for all of their flag-flying 
needs. Over time, Shields has developed 
lucrative relationships with everyone from 
Boy Scouts to church members—people 
with big appetites for flags. He rewards 
loyal customers with discounts on pack-
age deals, retires old flags in accordance 
with Army protocol, and refuses to charge 
veterans even though it means losing out 
on a big chunk of business. 


And business is something he can’t af-
ford to lose—in the last five years, sales 
have plummeted a staggering 40 per-
cent. The internet was one thing, but 
now he has to contend with the likes of 
Target and Walmart, who stock whole 
aisles of flags in the days marching up to 
the Fourth of July. Unless business im-
proves, Shields will have to consider a 
change of career to make ends meet for 
his wife, Rose, and his four kids. “I was 
thinking, actually, about doing some PI 
work for insurance companies,” he vol-
unteers. 


If forced to give up his spot on the Av-
enue, it’s not the flags he’s going to miss—
or the money. “I’m like Jack Kerouac,” he 
says, referring to the fact that he trades in 
stories as much as he trades in flags. There’s 
the old Polish woman who rejected a flag 
he sold her because the manufacturer had 
omitted the tiny crown that caps the eagle 
in the inset coat of arms (“The Commu-
nists made us take off the crown!”). And 
the Cold War veteran whose job it was 
in the sixties and seventies to drop sonar 
buoys on Russian subs. This has been the 
privilege of Shields’ career: He has never 
had to roam the country, as Kerouac did, 
in search of material. The stories have al-
ways come to him.
