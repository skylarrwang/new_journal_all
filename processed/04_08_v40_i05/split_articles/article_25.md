-push over the last several years to clean up 
an area that has served as an occasional 
student route between Swing Space and 
Science Hill. 

That a rehabilitation project begun in 
tandem with the 1997 construction of 
Swing Space has achieved so little tan-
gible progress is perhaps indicative of 
the University's minimal influence in the 
neighborhood. Since most of the remain-
ing property consists of private homes, it 
is unlikely that Yale will be able to acquire 
much of it. Funhermore, the closest the 
third building on the proposed site of the 
colleges-which will likely be filled with 
classrooms and performance spaces-will 
come to retail space is a late-night caf~. "I 
think it's doubtful," Morand says of com-
mercial development within the colleges. 
"It's not a priority for anyone that the col-
leges themselves include retail." 

Those who accept that the University 
is unlikely co single-handedly remake 
the neighborhood-an undoubtedly dif-
ficuh goal, given that past developments 
have generally required cooperation with 
the Mayor's Offi~hold out hope that 
the marker alone will spur development. 
Greg Morehead, the Ward 22 alderman 
who represents the area, explains that resi-
dents are almosc universally enthusiastic 
about the prospect of the colleges. Many, 
Morehead included, hope that some 
modest development will follow. "I don't 
think [it will be) necessarily attracted by 
the colleges," he concedes. "But it's going 
to be a plus. If there are no restaurants in 
the area, some will be attracted by the col-
leges." Morand also believes, despite his 
doubts about student purchasing power 
as a draw for commerce, that businesses 
will respond in some way to the influx of 
several hundred new residents. 

Healy offers a more damning assess-
ment. "There are no commercial corridors 
close enough co the proposed site of the 
colleges co see any influx of new com-
merce: he says. "It's possible, though, 
that commercial demand will grow or-
ganically, providing incentive for the 
development of storefronts in the area. â€¢ 
But Healy guesses that the most probable 
commercial influx will be in the form of 
food pushcarts. 

PERHAPS, ULTIMATELY, DEVELOPMEST OF 
the l..olo\o-er Hillhouse area will be unneces-
sary for students in the new colleges. They 
will be three minutes' walking distance 
from the nearest scores on Whitney. and 
President Levin has endorsed the College 
Study Groups' recommendations that the 
University enhance security in the area 
and provide regular transportation be-
tween the new additions and the rest of 
campus (the center of which is, after all, 
only three blocks away). The University 
may even consider new retail on the first 
floor of the Becton Center. 

But, in the absence of commercial de-
velopment, life for students who live in 
the new colleges will be crucially different 
from student life in every other residential 
college. While the others are cloistered 
not only within the University itself bur 
also within the most thriving and inviring 
parts of the city, the new colleges will jut 
into an area in which students will have 
little reason ever to set foot. 

The new colleges might pierce the Yale 
bubble, placing studentS side-by-side with 
a good American neighborhood. In this 
way, the University may finally realize irs 
2000 Framework objective of "blending 
campus edges with surrounding neigh-
borhoods." Bur if students end up more 
isolated and inconvenienced than their 
peers, they might find themselves wish-
ing that the University, somewhere in its 
Study Group document or official delib-
erations, had planned co place their new 
home somewhere they might actually 
want to live.
