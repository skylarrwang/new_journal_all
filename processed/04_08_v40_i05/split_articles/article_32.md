AT 10 A.M. ON FEBRUAR\' I 5• PRECOCIOUS 
teenager~ and under-employed young 
adulr.s from acrms Connec.:cicut began to 
convene en masse in from of New Ha-
ven's BAR restaurant. Most of the v.omen 
seemed to have applied Sephora'~ entire 
make-up and perfume inventory prior to 
the pilgrimage. Some fumbled in hand-
bags for tissues, v. hile others smoked pink 
and turquoise p.teks of <.';a mel ultralights. 
The fur protruding from rheir c.:oars v.as 
on par with the decor of a Ukrainian 
hunting lodge. The smattering of men 
compensated for their low numbers with 
a variety of testosterone-dripping accesso-
ries: Energy drinks emblamncd with "No 
Fearn decals, abundant and unpredictably 
located facial piercings, panb c.:overed in 
NBA ream logos. Arrh•ing at the queue 
at half past noon, I felt a distinct lack of 
camaraderie emanating from the assem-
bled masses. Though I had bleac.:hcd and 
gelled my widm' 's peak and thrown on a 
tracksuit, I was anxioU5. Fear and loathing 
hung like Axe bod) spray in the chill win-
ter air. Bur thb unease was understand-
able. We v.ere all competing for the arne 
thing. We all wanted to be cast in MTV's 
7ht Rtall>."'or/d, ~son 21. 
Every kid blessed with tebision access 
during the past ten years harbors some 
38 
form of jungian collective consciousness 
based on a clip moorage from this show. 
We may go years without a relapse, but 
those images-scenes of hoc-rub fon-
dlings, of Rurhie collapsing naked in the 
sho,,er during the second Hav.aii epi-
sode-linger in the corners of our brains 
like kidney stones waiting to dislodge. 
\\'hen I first heard about the New Ha-
ven casting call, it had been years since 
I watched Tht &a/ World. But, right on 
schedule, some unchecked, hisrrionic af-
finiry for broadcasting myself into mil-
lions of American homes began to blos-
som in my gut. Fame was calling. I had to 
call back. 
After waiting about an hour in rhe cold, 
listening to a GMC Suburban pulsare 
Hor97 while parked running on the curb, 
I was called inside. The space teemed wirh 
chatty people in har.s. Sitting at a wooden 
table \\irh a pack of girls, I was handed 
an application. a pen. and a beer cozy ad-
verrhing Lacry the Cable Guy's new film, 
Witkss Prouction. Across from me, several 
ladies who appeared to have only recently 
hit puberty strategized about hov. to be.t 
fill out the form. 
"What's my best quality?" asked one. 
"You're honest," replied her friend. 
"What's my worst quality?" continued 
the first. 
~You're kind of a bitch." 
Finally, my table was summoned to 
the back of the restaurant for a group in-
terview. "lell us your most embarrassing 
moment," demanded the casting director. 
Someone. apparently. had fallen off of a 
guardrail while trying to have sex with a 
homeless person. Another had peed in 
her pants before a stadium full of Lenny 
Kravitz fans. After another 15 minutes 
of heinous personal anecdotes, we were 
told ro sum up our personalities with one 
word before leaving. 
"I'm a freak!" declared the first girl. 
"I'm promiscuous!" yelled the second. 
Faced with the prospect of condensing 
my menty years oflife into one or rwo syl-
lables, I choked. All around me, mascara-
swathed eye~ stared like bats in a damp 
cave. lhe ca.~ring director clicked her nails 
against the table. Finally. the moment of 
rrurh: "l'm ... single?"
