HANDYMAN 
Dwight Godwin is a few decades older 
than the 120 freshmen in Directed 
Studies this year, but he still keeps the 
philosophy syllabus, from Aristotle to 
Wittgenstein, sitting on his bookshelf. 


Godwin is a professional American 
Sign Language (ASL) interpreter at Yale, 
whose clients include a DS student, and 
he takes his responsibility seriously—he 
has ingested everything from poetry to 
graduate-level particle physics. “I read all 
of the same books that the students read,” 
Godwin says. This reading is part of a 
demanding, self-imposed regimen that 
extends from 5:30 a.m. until 11 p.m., 
and is split between Yale and a handful of 
other Connecticut universities. 


Godwin speaks with enthusiasm, 
gesturing frequently and fingerspelling 
acronyms for emphasis. He forms his sen-
tences with precision and carefully modu-
lates his pace to suit his listener. Along 
with five other regular and independent 
sign language interpreters and four others 
who assist less frequently, Godwin forms 
an integral part of the services offered to 
the six deaf and hard-of-hearing students 
at Yale. The interpreters work in teams of 
two, providing support for the same class-
es all semester. For large lectures, Yale of-
fers the more high-tech Computer Aided 
Real-Time Transcription (CART) system, 
where stenographers provide what Judy 
York, director of the Resource Office on 
Disabilities, calls “closed captioning for 
the classroom.” 


Freshman Ariel Baker-Gibbs, who uses 
interpreters for all four of her seminar-
style classes, deems Yale’s system “pretty 
good.” She emphasizes the importance of 
skilled interpreters, explaining that “the 
information is at the discretion of the 
interpreter;” when they make mistakes, 
her own educational experience suffers. 


Godwin recognizes his obligation to his 
clients, describing the pressure of being 
“responsible for providing such an accu-
rate translation that the students have full 
and equal access to the information.” 


Part of the problem is that sign lan-
guage is a uniquely challenging means of 
communication. According to Godwin, 
many people don’t realize that “ASL is its 
own language. It has syntax, it has rules.” 
Many interpreters use a combination of 
ASL and other forms of sign that more 
closely mimic English syntax. Godwin 
employs both techniques, engaging in 
“constant negotiation with the deaf per-
son to make sure semantic intent is being 
realized.”
