iBOOKWORM 
Anyone who has sat through a lecture be-
hind a classmate on Facebook—or been 
that classmate on Facebook—knows how 
utterly compelling the online adventures 
of a complete stranger can become, es-
pecially in the context of Psych 10. At-
tention shifts seamlessly from personality 
types to photos, from language acquisi-
tion to Scrabulous. But what gets lost in 
cyberspace when students are equally reli-
ant upon professors and Macbooks to get 
through a fifty-minute lecture? 


According to Professor Amy Hunger-
ford, who teaches a lecture course on the 
American novel, class should not be a pas-
sive experience like watching television. 
Rather, it should be a chance for students 
to learn how to “assimilate language” and 
follow a logical argument. “You can’t learn 
how to listen” while surfing the web or 
checking your email,” she insists. 


 Ostensibly, we attend Yale to learn 
from some of the world’s most renowned 
scholars and sit beside some of the most 
accomplished students in the country. But 
the classroom experience is more than the 
PowerPoints, more than the discussion 
sections, and more than the final exam. 


Professors strive for a lecture “experi-
ence,” not just a relay of information 
that students could obtain by copying a 
classmate’s notes. They desire the intan-
gible impact of sharing knowledge. Even 
professors who teach in lecture halls the 
size of cinemas like to imagine a conversa-
tion rather than a performance. “It’s not 
a recital,” explains Professor Haun Saussy, 
who teaches this semester’s World Poetry 
and Performance. “There’s a difference be-
tween transmitting information and actu-
ally raising questions.” 


When one person’s attention wanders, 
Professor Saussy can detect the entire class 
becoming distracted. “Everyone indirectly 
senses it,” he says, including professors. “I 
give better lectures when I feel more con-
nected to the class,” Hungerford explains. 
With the rise of laptop use in lecture, this 
connection wanes. 


Saussy strives to teach a riveting class 
by drawing upon his own inspiring class-
room experiences in graduate school. 
“When you teach, you really are laying 
down tracks of thought,” he says. He 
waits for a “flicker of enlightenment” 
in the faces of his students, gauging his 
effectiveness by their expressions. “I 
want people to be involved!” His concep-
tion of the classroom forum, “an ancient 
form of knowledge diffusion,” borders on 
the sacred. 


Professors and students at Yale pride 
themselves on mutual respect—they strive 
to foster a community of scholars rather 
than splitting a didactic divide. Professor 
Charles Hill is adamant about the strength 
of professor-student relationships at Yale. 
He cites a recent article in The Chronicle of 
Higher Education lamenting the growth in 
disciplinary exactitude in many colleges 
today; the article describes a growing pro-
liferation of syllabi that outline rules for 
class conduct. “There is a complete break-
down in relationships at these schools,” he 
explains. “But that is not the case here.” 


Hungerford and Saussy also acknowl-
edge a culture of mutual respect. They 
crave a method of harnessing a class’s 
attention without undermining this aca-
demic bond. “You don’t want to alienate 
students,” explains Hungerford. She says 
she knows that nobody means to dis-
respect her or spoil her lecture by using 
laptops in class, but the recent electronic 
garden springing up in her lecture hall 
was enough to spur action. “My strategy 
was to make a joke,” she says, stating the 
starting fact of a recent study on email 
addiction and focus that she shared with 
her American novel class: Those who fre-
quently check their inboxes register lower 
IQs during moments of weakness than 
their email-abstinent peers. 


Saussy recently made an online bid for 
students’ full class-time attention on his 
blog at Printculture.com. He wrote that 
he is a “reasonable human being with the 
power to issue Fs, yes, so as you value your 
résumé, treat me with the care due a crazy 
dictator who might have his hand on the 
hot button.” In person, however, Saussy 
cheerfully acknowledges and understands 
how compelling email and online distrac-
tions can be. “I’ve done it myself,” he 
admits. Sometimes he notices when stu-
dents “are smiling to themselves because 
they’ve just gotten some email from their 
beloved. But I just want to say, ‘We’re here 
to read Shakespeare, darn it!’”
