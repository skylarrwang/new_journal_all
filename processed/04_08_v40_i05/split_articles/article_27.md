EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
says senior Janice Wong, a molecular bio-
chemist who took the class. Intrigued by 
the material, she continued to study with 
Hamlin as a sophomore and spent the fol-
lowing summer studying abroad in Ger-
many.

Hamlin's colleague, German Professor 
Carol Jacobs, is just as happy to have con-
tributed to the program. "My experience 
teaching a freshman seminar was exhil-
arating," she says. "In no other seminar I've 
taught at Yale have I seen students grow as 
much as in that semester."

BUT THE RECENT SIGNS OF STABILIZATION 
portend difficulties of their own. Growth 
has slowed: last year's 33 seminars were 
followed by this year's 32.

"We're at a plateau right now," admits 
Levesque. Nevertheless, he is excited to 
shepherd the program into its fifth year. 
Several notable faculty will teach new 
freshman seminars, including John Gad-
dis, who will lead a course entitled "How 
History Teaches"; others will return. But 
as the program attempts to continue its 
growth, it faces the challenges that come 
with provoking entrenched academic 
structures.

One obstacle is the program's reluc-
tance to engage junior faculty members. 
The vast majority of freshman seminar 
professors are, like Gaddis, tenured or ten-
ure-track faculty with long records of ser-
vice to the University and reputations as 
devoted teachers. Such a teaching force is 
one of the program's strengths, of course, 
and Dean Levesque's office has resisted 
the temptation to fill holes with non-lad-
der faculty who might not be around for 
four continuous years to develop the sort 
of long-lasting relationships the program 
is meant to inspire. But the fact that only 
eight of this year's 32 seminars are taught 
by ladder faculty still working to achieve 
tenure—a demographic which dominates 
the college's teaching corps—suggests that 
the program's strength also diminishes its 
ability to expand.

Junior faculty remain largely disin-
terested in the program. The primary 
culprit is the incentive structure created 
by the academy's so-called tenure ladder. 
"Tenured faculty often have more flexibil-
ity in what they can do," says Levesque. 
"For a lot of them, teaching a freshman 
seminar is a welcome opportunity to do 
something new." Junior faculty, on the 
other hand, confronted with the pressure 
to publish, often need to gravitate toward 
large lectures and advanced seminars. The 
former require little in the way of course 
design, and the latter are more helpful in 
advancing one's own research. Under a 
system that subordinates teaching skills to 
publishing prowess, the freshman seminar 
program is bumping up against a teacher 
shortage.

Other challenges may not be intrinsi-
cable—just expensive. "I don't know that 
we'll be able to get beyond this plateau 
without significant additional resources," 
Levesque states. Funding, which is begin-
ning to stream in from committed alumni 
donors, could be directed to one of two 
areas: Either to a long-term investment in 
administrative support or to understaffed 
academic departments. The first need 
is clear: Levesque and a single assistant 
oversee not only the freshman seminar 
program, but also freshman counseling, 
pre-orientation programs, and first-year 
advising. Additional funding could hire a 
full-time seminar coordinator and build a 
training program for professors who wish 
to teach but do not feel pedagogically pre-
pared to teach freshmen.


"in freshman year, a 
genuine intellectual 
transformation takes 
place." 
-Cyrus Hamlin


Donating the funds directly to academic 
departments is more complex and ties into 
an issue addressed in the recent report on 
Yale College expansion: The alleviation 
of pressures within individual depart-
ments, particularly in the social sciences. 
For example, the incredibly popular po-
litical science department has offered only 
three freshman seminars since 2004, and 
all were in the program's first two years. 
"We simply don't have the faculty," said 
Political Science Professor Susan Stokes, 
the department's director of undergradu-
ate studies. Departments as strapped as 
political science must save their seminar 
resources for upperclassmen.

Still, Levesque suggests that an increase 
in freshman seminar funding could alle-
viate one deficiency while also helping to 
solve the other. "With more resources," 
says Levesque, "we could work with de-
partments to find creative solutions to 
staffing needs." One approach—shared by 
several of Yale's peer institutions—would 
be a permanent endowment that would 
compensate Yale departments for teach-
ing time, allowing them to hire visiting 
or full-time faculty to fill programmatic 
needs. By contributing funding to the de-
partmental pot, the program could secure 
a commitment from individual depart-
ments to offer a small number of fresh-
man seminars each year.

Buder, for one, is skeptical. "I'd say we 
need to expand the faculty in political sci-
ence," he says. "If we can do that, we'll 
have some room for freshman seminars. 
But I personally wouldn't go for visiting 
people—and I think it's most important 
that we grow political science to a decent 
size." While Levesque prioritizes immedi-
ate challenges and Butler long-term ob-
stacles, both agree that there are gaps to 
fill. The question is how—and when.

YALE'S PEER INSTITUTIONS HAVE GRAPPLED 
with, and largely resolved, similar prob-
lems. Harvard's freshman seminar pro-
gram traces its roots to the 1960s and has 
experienced something of a renaissance 
in the last five years. Its offerings have 
quadrupled in number, reaching 122 this 
year. "Departments were asked to look at 
giving freshman seminars as part of their 
overall curricular planning," explains San-
dra Naddaff, who directs the Harvard 
program. "That went a long way towards 
getting departments to offer seminars and 
to think about it as something that was 
part of their service to the college."

Roughly a third of Harvard seminars 
are taught by non-ladder faculty mem-
bers, and another quarter are taught by 
professional school professors who are 
directly compensated by the program. 
"Harvard's a bigger place—they have a lot 
more of those people running around," 
notes Levesque. "We've always wanted 
to keep the program under departments' 
control."

Princeton's freshman seminar program 
resembles a more developed version of 
Yale's own. Most of this year's 78 seminars 
are taught by senior faculty, including 
Toni Morrison, Joyce Carol Oates, and 
the college's former provost, Amy Gutt-
man. Moreover, since its inception in the 
late 1980s, the program's financial struc-
ture has echoed Levesque's ambitions. 
Roughly half of Princeton's freshman sem-
inars are funded directly by endowments, 
and the program reimburses departments 
for the teaching time contributed by their 
professors. Some of the endowment funds 
can also be used to subsidize activities like 
dinners, field trips, or summer continua-
tions of certain courses.

If other Ivy League colleges can offer 
Yale's freshman seminar program a les-
son, it is the necessity of funding. Hamlin 
makes a blunt case: "Yale is rich. Lately, 
their endowment is doing so well that 
they ought to commit to staffing the 
freshman seminars in sufficient numbers 
such that any freshman who wants to take 
one, can."

Four years ago, smarting from my re-
jection, I might have agreed. Though it 
would be nice to allow rejected applicants 
spaces in a seminar, the gap between sup-
ply and demand is not the only factor 
that influences scheduling. Students often 
drop classes they sign up for, leaving some 
seminars unfilled while others remain 
overbooked. Incoming freshmen who 
intend to pursue majors in science and 
math are particularly problematic, and 
those departments have resisted heavy 
participation in the program.

The freshman seminar program may 
have expanded to just about its limit. 
Levesque, for his part, seems to be moving 
onto new challenges. "What would it be 
like to teach CHEM 114 in a thirty-per-
son class?" he asks. In his eyes, freshman 
seminars are incubators of educational 
innovation rather than a one-size-fits-all 
solution.

"We have to accept that there is no 
perfect way to make every single fresh-
man have a great experience," says Lau-
rans. Yale's challenge in coming years will 
be to accept this reality, adjust to it, and 
still live up to the sky-high expectations of 
Blue Book-gripping freshmen in July.
