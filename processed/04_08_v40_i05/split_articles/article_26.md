IT BEGINS WITH A BWE BOOK. 
Each July, reluctant hands Rip through 
pulpy pages. Corners are folded, pages arc 
marked, highlighters run dry. At the end 
of summer, every moment is bittersweet, 
but the arrival of the Yale College course 
caralog heralds the end. 

Except for freshmen. I remember my 
first Blue Book, dog-cared within hours 
and scrawled full of marginalia within the 
week. I declined Directed Studies that 
summer, deciding I had too many choices 
to be directed. 

Instead, I applied for a freshman semi-
nar. A small class had three chief virtues 
in my mind: It would allow me to get to 
know a professor the way I'd known my 
high-school teachers, it would introduce 
me to freshmen with similar interests, and 
it would point me down a track toY;ard 
a major, or not. I picked MRevolutionary 
America.~ taught by Jon Buder, dean of 
the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. 
A big name. a big wpic, a big disappoint-
ment: I was rejected in August. 

BlTfLER, I LEARNED THIS WEEK, IS SHORT 
o~nd grey-bearded. His voice is lilting, and 
\\hen he's excited, he giggle:.. He reminds 
me of my grandfather, except my grand-
father is not a world-famous historian. 
Though Buder is "too busy dean-ing ~ to 
teach a lecture on religion and modern 
America, the topic that made him famous, 
he is teaching it as a freshman seminar. 
This is a major loss for rhe upperclass-
men who would have filled his lecture 
hall. After all, his seminar garners glowing 
reviews year after year: "lr was personal 
and real," one effusive freshman writes. 
"Having an opportunity ro learn with teh 
(sic] Dean of rhe Grad School is price-
less," exclaims another. "He truly helped 
improve my writing and has made me a 
better student in the process." Asked if 
he or she would recommend rhe course 
to others, one freshman notes, "I already 
have. Unfortunately, none of them can 
take it because they're nor going to be 
freshmen again." 

· Io Buder, such accolades are the 
highest form of praise. He is not merely 
the professor of one of the most popu-
lar freshman seminars, but rhe person 
who catalyzed the program's crea£ion six 
years ago. Buder served as a member of 
the Committee on Yale College Educa-
tion (CYCE), which convened in 2001 
ro "assess the adequacy of the current 
undergraduate program and to consider 
changes and improvements." It was he 
who suggested that the College take a 
new approach to educating freshmen, and 
it was he who taught the first fre,hman 
seminar in the fall of2002. 

That seminar was 
"Revolutionary 
America," the class I triple-underlined in 
.. green htghlighter cwo ye3rs later. When 
Buder first offered it, he admits he w:u 
offering it as a test CI.SC to prove that the 
format could work. "I probably wasn't 
the right person to do it," he says with a 
laugh. "I had a bit of a vested anterest." 

Afrer an unden,helming stan in 2002, 
when only 13 students showed up for the 
firsr day of class-"no one knew quite 
what it was, so the registrar had assigned 
the cour)e to a lecture hall" -the course 
developed a reputation. Ont" ye3r later, 55 
freshmen crowded into a semin.u room 
eager ro sign up. 

While no ont" doubted rhar Buder's 
seminar would find succe~s. a singlt" stellar 
seminar daes nor make a program. Fresh-
!l13.Jl seminars, however, have .1chievc:d 
success in their own right. "!heir small 
• size and rv.ice-\\eekly meetings nurture 
relationships among students and facuhy. 
Their interactive dynamic encourages 
freshmen to engage in their own educa-
tion. "This isn't Math 112," s;~ys Dean of 
Freshman Affairs George Levesque, who 
runs the program. "You're having an ac-
rual conversation." 

Six ye3rs after Buder's test run, as the 
program faces its first full e\-aluation, the 
freshman seminar experiment has only 
one glirch: too many freshman e3ger ro 
rake roo few courses. 

IN 2004, THF. COLLF.GF. OFFERIJO 16 SEMI· 
nars, with room for just under three hun-
dred freshmen to enroll. "this year, there: 
are 32--enough ro sear one third of the 
class of 20 II. Add that ro the Directed 
Studies and Perspective.) on Science popu-
lations-the three programs are mutually 
exclusive-and that figure rises ro almrut 
50 percent. 

Nonetheless, plenty of freshmen are left 
out. This year, 0\er eight hundred fresh-
men applied for jusr under five hundred 
seminar seats, despite the dean's offices 
avowed desire 10 create a space for ~ery 
interested student. At liberal aru colleges 
scattered throughout the country, the 
idea that only half of all freshmen rake 
a single small class v.ould be laughable. 
Bur first·)ears in the freshman seminar 
program, Directed .Studies, and Perspcc-
rives on Science are nor rhe only one~ ex· 
pc:riencing the intimae}• of the classroom. 
The English, mathematics, and language 
departments have offered ~mall introduc-
tory cl~es for decades. A few year~ ago, 
<:\'en the economics department, \\hich is 
nor known for its attention ro pedagogy, 
added a small, lottery-based alternathe to 
its large introductory lecrures. 

Still, the overwhelmingly enthusiastic 
response from students in freshman semi-
nars seems to indicate that the program 
h unique. "Among students, I think the 
satisfaction rate is probably 85, 90 per-
cent," Levesque estimates. Asked to evalu-
ate the classes at term's end, freshmen 
describe: their seminars with exclamations 
like "awesome" and "TAKE IT!" Many 
freshmen ask their seminar professors ro 
serve as second-year advisor~. Associate: 
Dean Penelope Laurans, who converted a 
longstanding poetry course: ro a freshman 
seminar in 2005, estimates rhar 13 of her 
freshmen studenrs from last spring now 
come ro her for academic advice. 

Loyal converts include nor just stu· 
dents bur professors. Of this year's 32 
seminars, 23 are taught by profo)or~ v.ho 
are returning to reach a second course or 
to repeat a first. These namo, \\hich in-
clude physicist Peter Parker and jack-of-
all-trades 81 • Summers, are among Yale's 
most notable; 'l!mosr all have tenure and 
several have won reaching awards. 

All agree that the program has be-
come one of Yale's finest commitments 
to it' Mudents. "'I he: pedagogical value of 
these seminar' w freshmen is very clear," 
says Cerman Profes,or Emeritus Cyrus 
Hamlin, who taught a seminar on Ger-
man culture ustng the: Beinc:cke Library's 
collections in 2004. "In freshman year, a 
genuine intellectual transformation rakes 
place." Hamlin retired in 2005 bur is con-
sidering rerurnmg in mo }ea~ to reach 
another freshman seminar. 

Buder is pleased. "Faculty have come 
up to me and said, 'lbb i~ the best te3ch-
ing expenence I have ever had. Period,'" 
he ~id. "I think the program's working." 
lhe doubts expre,sed by CYCE members, 
which centered on concern that the ex-
panding program would eventually run 
out of interested f.1culty members, have 
largely di,sipatcd. 

IJIE PROGRAM liAS Al-~0 HAO A POSITIVE 
effect on fiN-year .1dvising. "The advising 
'YMc:m needs an overhaul," says Levesque. 
"'Ine hope for frl-:;hman seminars is that 
students and faculty develop long-term 
relationships." .Sighing. he continues: "I 
don't think the freshman seminar pro-
gram alone can sohe that problem, bur 
it's seemed ro provide a much more or-
game way for freshmen to get to know 
faculty members." 

Hamlin's experience pro\·es rhe point. 
His seminar, v.hich required a reading 
knowledge of German, consisted of only 
eight freshmen-and he h~ kept up with 
many. "110\ed the attention rhat we got,"
