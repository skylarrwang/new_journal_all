THE FAMILY WE CHOOSE 
ON SUNDAY, DECEMBER l, AT THE CE.."• 
TRAL Veterirury Hospital in Nc:\\ Ha\c:n, 
there are few patie-nts and a lot of bodtc:s. 
"lt'5 just been sad lately," D.midle, a vet 
technician, says v.ith a tired stgh in 
the open "Emergency Care" area in the 
hospital's basement. "It's 'cause the holi-
days are coming." she admtts, and, before 
I can open my mouth, she rurns back 
to her computer. I don't undt:ro.tand the 
connection. 

Instde the bright, linoleum emergency 
care area, a silver boom box on a shelf next 
to a swaying test tube tray has been play-
ing holiday songs, one after another, all 
day long. "Lt:r Your Da) Ek MelT}." "Win-
ter Wonderland." "Let it now." "White: 
Christmas." OutSide, the first now of the 
year-or freezing ram, nther-is falling 
in the early dusk. 

"Bet\\-een Tha.nksgivmg and Chnstmas 
\\e do a lot ot euthanasia," D r. Kris Gnu 
S3)S, picking up on my confusion. "Every 
Yl'ar. 

"\'lhy?" I ask. Over rhe course of one 
Jay, I ha\e seen ~even hypodermic needb 
filled \\ith a hot pink liquid, and 5even 
dead pets carried (if a cat) or v.heeled on a 
can (if a dog) down the hallway. I've seen 
three of them euthanized myself: "Dusty: 
"Kirtcn," and "Celeste." 

We seem to take more lives during the 
holidays, it occurs to me later. Our own, 
as suicide rates notoriously cltmb every 
year with the approach of the ~ew Year, 
and-as I dL\Cover 
anecdotally~ur 
pets'. Suicide statistia garner attention, I 
think, because we bclieH: Y.e understand 
them. 1he grating, unrelenting cheer of 
the season, the out-of-hanJ materialism, 
the stress of family gatherings, the y.c:ight 
of that annual charge to fix our Raws, htt 
w all in \"arying degrees. 

But pets? 

DURING A LULL IN ACTIVITY AT THE HOSPI-
TAl , I demand an explanation, and nurses 
Linda, Mary. and Trudy gather around 
to offer a fc:\\ theories. Visiting relatives 
make owners reevaluate the hassles of 
caring for an unhealthy pet. Big dogs do 
poorly in cold weather. "It's the end of the 
year," says Mary. shrugging. "On to new 
thing,." :-\o one can offer anything more 
certain than that. 

Whtle human euthanasia floats in the 
realm of Op-Ed pages, poliucal posruring. 
and passionate publtc debate, itS animal 
countetpan is much more matter-of-fact, 
sitting in a box of vials under the syringes. 
And the blunt posstbiliry of euthanasia 
tn the pet \\Orld makes the discussion of 
death almo.st unrc:cogmzably different. 

Righr-ro-die advocates portray human eu-
thanasia ~an alternative to the arrogance 
of the medkal prof..:ssion-the right to do 
what nature will ~hortly do anyway. For 
pers. the arrogance runs the other way, ~ 
we assume rhe duty of deciding when the 
suffering should scop. 

FOR MOST Pl-.T OWNERS, THE FIRST STEP 
to the animal hospital comes when they 
notice something's wrong. Thomas Ma-
son and his young ron were walking their 
nine-week-old American Bulldog. Dusry, 
along Long Bt:ach in Branford, when 
Dusty sniffed a mushroom and gobbled 
up another. Mr . .Mason assured his son 
that Du~ry. whom they'd brought home 
just rwo weeks earlier, would be 6ne. A 
day later, Ousry was shaking and couldn't 
stand up. She: started ro have seizures in 
• the car on the way to the hospital. 

Preparing w start on morning rounds 
with three other vets, Or. Laura McKay 
asks. "Do you want to scan with the sad 
or not so sad?" The consensus is sad, and 
Dusty is the first stop. Or. McKay rattl~ 
off her stat:.. Activated Clotting Tune 
(ACT) above 4000. Ammonia up. Glu-
cose in the toilet. ~This mushroom has 
fun nicknames," she says, ~like death an-
gel. destroyer angel." Dusty's liver is fail-
ing. "A single mushroom can kill a small 
child." she concludes. \Yle look and coo 
once more as Dusry raises her wrinkly in-
fant head. \Yie move on. 

A few hours later in a small office off 
the central F.R area, Dr. Grau hangs up 
the phone with Poison Control and 
makes a poury face. "In humans. we'd 
do a liver rransplam," Or. Grau says, ~bur 
we haven't gotten there for the animal 
world yer." 

THE LISE BI!TWEEI' PET A...;o CHILD OF-
TEN blurs for rhe serious animal lover. and 
the Animal Hospital is one place where 
this feeling is understood. "I deal with 
the same thing with my daughter," Dr. 
Grau ~ays. commiserating with an owner 
whose pug. Brittany, has allergies. Brit-
tany is wearing a rainbow sweater and has 
been dragging her "girly pares" across the 
living room floor. As she follows behind 
her daughter's epileptic golden rerriever, 
another woman half-jokes to me. "~fy 
granddaughter!" 

In the hospital files, patienrs are given 
April2008 
their owners' last names: "Ruby" Parter-
ron, or "Bravehearr" Fucci. "We began 
to long for the pirrer patter of little feet: 
reads a quote on a calendar hanging in 
the office, "so we bought a dog. \Ylell, it's 
cheaper, and you ger more feet." At home, 
I have caught my mom calling our my 
name to our ten-year-old Bernese Moun-
rain Dog, Marilla, "by accident." 

The distance between this hospital's 
patienrs and the human world, however, 
reveals itself in the ER. "Oh, man, this is 
disgusting," Dr. McKay says as she lacer-
ates a cyst on tbe back of a black car. "'lou 
smell terrible!" she continues as she works, 
saying something no pediatrician would 
ever dare in front of a diem. "Look, this 
eat's been snorting coke;' Linda jokes, 
holding down a black cat with white 
flecks around its nose, as another nurse 
gives him a shot. 

Pet:.' inabiliry to communicate their 
burrs only makes their mothers and fa-
thers more dependent on hospital sraff. 
As Dr. Grau and I enter room after room 
ro meet with shaken owners and their sick 
or hurt or dying pers, I keep expecting 
the owners to glare ar me for intruding at 
.~uch a personal rime. Instead, ~ soon as 
we enter, I become invisible. lhc paricms 
might patter over to sniff me, siz.c me up, 
or wag a tail, but the eyes of the owners 
immediately seize on Or. Grau. waiting to 
hear her words, as if from a prophet. 

"Perc does have plenty of stool in him," 
Dr. Grau tells Frank Hardy. a middle aged 
man brimming with emotion. "I knew 
it!" he r~ponds, throwing his hands up 
in rhe air. Dr. Grau speaks with rhe sooth-
ing voice of a kindergarten reacher. She 
explains what she has found. "He's got 
keystones in his urine," she sotys, "which 
means Perc has diabetes." Next she offers 
her advice for treatment, ending by em-
phasizing that "right now we want to get 
Percy feeling berrer first, before anything 
else." 

"That's wonderful," Hardy nods. kec:p-
ing it together, and follows her our of rhe 
room ro look at Petey's X-rays. 

OR. CRAU ENTERS CHECK-UP ROOM fOUR. 
where my mother and I sit waiting. She 
closes the door gently behind her. She 
w~ 
blue scrubs over a plump but sturdy 
frame, and her dark hair i.s pulled back 
from her warm face in a ponytail. Or. 
Grau, as I 6nd our a few weeks later, loves 
emergency veterinary work, lunch, and 
laughing. "I didn't do ir!" she exclaims, 
and then giggles, whenever a docror or 
nurse calls her name from across the room. 
When it's getting close ro rwo and lunch 
hasn't been ordered, she mock-shouts, 
"Never keep a fat girl from her lunch!" 

A heartfelt "rhar sucks" is her refrain for 
all the lows of the day, from discouraging 
blood test results to a cat just put down. 
She is the caring. competent elementary 
school teacher in the check up room, with 
an endearing penchant for naughty PG 
humor behind closed doors. 

MY FIRST TRIP TO THE ANIMAL. HOSPITAL 
was on November 11, when I called my 
mom about an Otlullo paper and found 
her choking back sobs on the other end. 
"She just collapsed," she said of Marilla. 
A neighbor had helped lift Marilla's sev-
enty-pound frame into the back of our 
Volvo station wagon, and my mom had 
rushed her to the animal hospital just a 
fe\\ blocks a\vay. 

In the parking lot, Marilla managed to 
get out of the car herself, and my mom 
wondered if she had overreacted. In-
side, however, the vet technician lifted 
up Marilla's black lips and pronounced, 
~She: has grey gums." Grey gums mean 
profuse internal bleeding. As the tech-
nician whisked Marilla away to the ER, 
the receptionist pushed a form in front of 
my mom. "Sign here," she said, "co begin 
emergency treatment." 

The news so far sounded grim. "I don't 
know what to do," my mom whispered 
over the phone. So I put down my paper 
and drove to the hospital a few miles away, 
ro see Marilla for perhaps the last rime, 
and, in a rare moment, to comfort my 
mom, instead of the other way around. 

"1 NEED TO TELL )'OU EXACTLY WHAT's 
going on," Dr. Grau says, her no-non 
sense cone powerful and soothing. "Then 
we can talk about what decisions you 
might need to make." Dr. Grau delivers 
information in calm. dige~tible chunks. 
~1arilla h bleeding into her abdomen and 
has a large mass there; the prognosis for 
rhese siruarions is never good. If the mass 
is confined to her spleen, the non-board-
cerrified surgeon on call can remove it. If 
it's on her liver, "he won't be able to deal 
with it." But he won't know until he opens 
her up, because ,\farilla"s internal bleeding 
blurs X-rap. An ultrasound would pin-
point the mas,, but this ho~pital doesn't 
have rhe equipment. We'd have to go to 
Norwalk, an hour's drive away. 

"Bur look," she says finally, in a tried 
and rrue formula I later come to recog· 
nize. "There arc: some things we: can do 
to just get a bit more: of a handle. Get 
her stable. Sec where: we: arc:." My mom 
and I nod, and Or. Grau leaves. "Isn't she 
wonderful?" my mom says hoarsely, and 
we are left sirring on the floor, stroking 
Marilla, who, be~ides brt.-athing unevenly. 
seems perfectly fine. 

MARILLA HAD THE Ol'f!R.-\110:>0 OVERSIGHT, 
and the: surgeon removed a grapefruiHized 
rumor from her spleen. My mom did nor 
blink at the $4,000 price mg of Marilla's 
blood work, X-rays, surgery, and post-op 
recuperation. Bur many do. Money is a 
touchy, ever-present subject at the animal 
hospital. Less than a quarter of pet owners 
have medical insurance, and .. most get it 
after they've had to spend a lor of money 
here," says Tracy, a nurse who presents fi-
nancial estimates to owners. 

OR. GRAU DOES NOT HOLD BACK PROM 
judging owners' tight-fisted behavior. 
"How would you like to get thrown twen-
ty feet in the air and get sent home with 
some Tylenol?" Dr. Grau fumes ro me 
when an owner decides ro forgo treatment 
for a dog who has been hit by a car. But 
she also spends much of her time reassur-
ing owners that sometimes euthanasia is 
the best--even if not the only-option. 

Around this time, I realize we could have 
put Marilla to sleep then and there and no 
one would have raised an eyebrow. 

"If you need someone to say, 'Is this OK 
to do?' I'm here ro say-'Ir is,"' Dr. Grau 
says quiedy on the phone to Mr. O'Brien 
(whose name has been changed), whose 
car, "Kinen: has a bladder full of stones 
for the third time. O'Brien decided to 
operate the first two times at two thou-
sand dollars a pop. Now Dr. Grau talks 
about qualiry of life, nor only the pet's 
but the family's. She reminds him that 
medicine offers "no guarantee," and then 
concludes, "I don't mean to sound crude, 
but there are so many cats in this world 
that need a home that don't have chronic 
medical problems." Pets are the family we 
choose, as a common saying goes, and Dr. 
Grau understands the hardnosed truth 
about choosing as much as the parr about 
family. 

"ARE YOU READY?" 
"Yeah." 
George Mason wears a puffy vest and 
sweatpants and talks with tough guy ani-
tude, but as Dr. Grau inserts the needle he 
looks up at the ceiling to hold back tears, 
stroking Dusty's four-pound body. 

I keep my eyes on Dusty. She seems al-
