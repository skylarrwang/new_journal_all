YALE's TWELVE RFSJDENTlAL CO LUGES ARE 
arranged in concentric rings around the 
University's core, each facing the central 
axis of Old Campus, Cross Campus, and 
Commons. The colleg~ along the Uni-
versity'.s eastern and \\'Otern rims, sitting 
wirh their backs exposed to the city, are 
encircled by waves of urban devdopmenr. 
Morse and Ezra Stiles are overlooked by 
Payne Whitney Gymnasium from across 
the arc of Tower Parkway. Rows of Park 
Sm:er student apartments, Lynwood fra-
ternities, and Howe Street restaurants 
border Pierson and Davenpon. Silliman 
and Timothy Dwight rest on a long arm 
of polished downtown office buildings 
and shops merching up Church Street. 
On the streets surrounding every college. 
from every side, facades arc maintained, 
srores abound, and the shared economic 
life of Yale and New Haven is, by any rea-
sonable m~"asure, thriving. 

But even Yale's most self-assured cheer-
leaders of progress do not expect this ro 
be the case for Yale's planned 13th and 
14th colk-ges. lh~e colleges, slated for a 
large triangle wedged bcrween Prospect 
on one end, Canal and the Gro,·e Street 
Cemetery on the ~econd, and Sachem 
on rhe third, will sir alongside an unde-
veloped <.orner of New Haven, an area 
which campus planners refer to as lower 
Hillhouse, and \\hich promises very little 
opportunity for economic growth. 

Heading past the corner of the des-
tined triangle currently occupied by 
~ludd Libr:try, onto a segment of Sachem 
that will be steps from a student's room in 
future years. and across a desolate stretch 
of empty lots and chain-link fences, one 
encounters the only unit of retail within 
blocks: Paolillo's Service Center, a claus-
trophobic blue automobile supply store 
advertising rwo \arieries of antifreeze and 
several name brand coolants in irs win-
dow. By the admission of Michael .Mo-
rand, Yale's dapper associate vice presi-
dent of New Haven and State Affairs, "If 
you look at this area now, there's not a lot 
of service retail." And, if Morand is to be 
believed, '\ery few shops and restaurants 
will be enticed to join Paolillo's even after 
the colleges are completed. "I wouldn't 
oversell the retail implications of the new 
colleges," he says. "Students don't have 
much purchasing power." 

This entire neighborhood'.; negligible 
appeal for future businesses and students 
is something that Morand and the Uni-
versity have made lirrle effort to deny. In-
stead, officials have ignored the problem 
publicly. perhaps because they realize that 
the truth may be a bitter pill for students 
and alumni to swallow: In the face of the 
University's most important expansion in 
half a century, the strategies which, for 15 
years. Yale and New Haven have joindy 
and successfully employed to attract 
wealth. revitalization, and investment to 
the city will, it appears. hit their limit. 

IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERESTIMATE THE in-
fluence Yale is unwilling-or unable--to 
use to transform Lower Hillhouse. Yale's 
engine of economic growth has no doubt 
been responsible for dramatic changes in 
the New Haven business-scape during 
the past decade and a half. Perceptions of 
town-gown conflict aside, the mayor's ad-
ministration recognizes the perks of host· 
ing a world class university. "It's beneficial 
for us being in a college town," explains 
Kelly Murphy. New Haven's economic 
development administrator. "I think the 
reladonship bcrween Mayor DeStefano 
and President Levin is very good. 'What's 
good tOr the city is good for Yale, and 
what's good for Yale is good for the city." 

Yale's primary economic strength ema-
nates from the fact that as a university. it 
is highly resistant to economic recessions. 
Yale attracts thousands of srudenrs, fac-
ulry, and staff to the city, bringing about 
half a million visitors to New H:tven an-
nually. The University, in turn, inocul.ues 
the areas around it, injecting local busi-
nesses such as support services, research, 
and particularly construction, with regu-
lar investments. University employees, 
who enjoy job and income security, spend 
their earnings on retail in the area. In 
2000, the University estimated that it di-
rectly conrributed almost a billion dollar~ 
to rhe merro area economy that year; its 
indirect impact was considerably greater. 

To :-:ew Ha\·en's benefit, Yale is a mag-
net for im·estmem. "A lot of people out-
side of the area may not know New Ha-
ven," Murphy says. "But they know Yale." 

National businesses. from the forthcom-
ing American Apparel on Broadway to 
Pfiur in irs immaculate $35 million 
clinical research facility next to the School 
of .Medicine, regularly approach Yale to 
consider leasing University property. Yale 
frequently rebuffs such requests and, ac-
cording to Karyn Gilvarg, a member of 
Murphy's economic development team, 
puts irs suitors in contact with the city. 
"When developers are interested, they 
send them our way," Gilvarg says, explain-
ing that this sort of "anecdotal" support 
can be extremely valuable. Sometimes 
Yale can catalyze a project merely by con-
tributing its prestige. The Omni Hotel on 
Temple Street was redeveloped once Yale 
agreed to attach irs name to the project, 
creating the Omni New Haven Hotel at 
Yale. "Something seemingly intangible 
like that," says Gilvarg, "can have a major 
impact." 

Across a desolate stretch 
of empty Lots and chain-
Link fences, one en-
counters the only unit 
of retail within blocks: 
Paolillo's Service Center. 

YAI.E CREATES THE GRI'.ATEST RIPPLE EFFECT, 
however, when it says yes to developers. 
On Broad\v-~y. the crown jewel of New 
Haven\ revitalization, Yale first started 
buying properties and upgrading the 
street'~ physical appearance more than 
ten years ago. Working with the city, Yale 
used its business relationships and pres-
tige to entice tenants such as]. Crew and 
Urban Outfitters. Scott Healy, executive 
director of the Town Green Special Ser-
vices District, a semi-independent devel-
opment agency funded direccly by prop-
erty owners. calls these national chains 
"retail anchors in downtown." Once the 
first chains had signed on, the dominoes 
began to fall. A full complement of busi-
nesses quickly emerged in what the Uni-
ver~ity now proudly calls irs "retail dis-
trict." Change was felt as far away as the: 
i\brrion on Whalley Avenue. The hotel 
chain moved into a building adjacent to 
campus bur not owned by the University. 
Morand refers to this rype of development 
as the "catalytic impact." 

When Yale expands, benefits rebound 
back to the city. Property raxes from de-
velopments fill the city's coffers and outer-
city residents come downtown to spend 
their money. Moreover, ~mall busines~es, 
whose role in the downtown economy 
has largely been slipping in recent years, 
have come to fill a niche created by the 
big business Yale brmgs to the ciry. Wal-
ter Esdaile, director of New Haven\ Small 
Business lniciative, c:xphins that, though 
Yale development has prevented rhe rise 
of cercain rypes of small businesses, ir has 
opened the door for others. "It's tougher 
for a lot of our smaller guys to step into 
the Yale srandard. let's pur it rhar way," he 
says, referring to locally owned shops in 
prime Yale areas. Bur for local conmuc-
rion contractors and supporr sen.ices, Yale 
provides a steady stream of business. This 
dynamic is one component of a pov.erful 
partnership that has achieved a great deal 
when President Levin and ~1ayor DeSte-
fano have pointed it in a mutually benefi-
cial direction. 

Lower Hillhouse, it appear,, h no sud: 
direcrion. Yale and ~ew Haven"s current 
development plans include no mention 
of transforming this quiet and somewhat 
dilapidated residential area-"a good 
American neighborhood," in Morand's 
careful construction-into a new center 
of commerce that those affiliated with 
and arrracted ro Yale might actually pa-
tronize. New Haven is nor prioritizing the 
neighborhood for development, and Yale: 
has either kept silent about irs dissatisf.lc-
tion or is simply indifferent. Whatever rhe 
reason, usustained cooperation~ between 
DeStefano and Levin. which Morand 
and so many others credit with being the 
first step toward change in the city, is not 
forchcoming for this neighborhood. 

"What's good for the 
city is good for Yale, and 
what's good for Yale is 
good for the city. " 
-Kelly Murphy 

lnqcad, the City and the University 
ha\e more or less agreed to focus on an 
en tardy different part of rown. DeS re-
f., no recently laid our New Haven's long 
term devdopmenr aims according ro a 
$1.5 billion agenda he calls the "Future 
Framework." Bearing his PowerPoim 
gospc:l to City Hall meetings. DeStefano 
explained that he w·amed ro see "urban 
in fill" around the downtown area by con-
verting rhe unsightly Route 34 highway 
into an urban boulevard and connecting 
the Medical District and Union Sta-
tion ro downtown proper. ~furphy later 
amplified rhe mayor\ philosophy: "New 
Haven is a fully dt"Vdoped ciry, basically, 
within our borders ... che idea is stitching 
rhe dry together." 

lr is a bold and exciting mission. and 
one to which che Uni\'c~•rv is also devot· 
ing much of irs attention. Since April of 
2000, when Yale pubLshed ~A frame-
\\Ork for Cunpu~ Planning," its blueprint 
for future: dc:vdopmc:nr, the University 
h.ts been looking to achieve: a goal con-
stantly repeated in the document: "im-
proved connections among Yale's three 


campuses," identified as Central Cam~ 
Pus, the Medical Center, and the Athletic 
Fields. Morand, echoing DeStefano, says 
the University's aim is "extending the vi~ 
tality of downtown" by connecting the 
University's core with the train station 
and the Medical Center. Yale is doubly in-
terested in f~tering development around 
the Medical School in order to create a 
•thriving biotechnology indu.my in :-:ew 
Ha\·en; according to Jon Soderstrom, 
managing director of the Office of Coop-
erative Research. The OCR, which works 
closely with Morand's office, is hoping 
chat 5uch an industry will help to attract 
and retain faculty by offering research op-
porrunities. 

For these reasons, the area berween 
Central Campus and the Medical School 
has been lavished with enormous at-
tention. The city is building a new high 
school and accompanying retail space, 
the University is leasing property at 300 
George Street to fill vacant lots, and the 
dean of the Medical School is constantly 
negotiating with outside developers. The 
University has committed eight million 
dollars to a new Economic Development 
Corporation run jointly by the City and 
Yale to provide an independent imperus 
for downtown development. 

((There are no com-
mercial corridors close 
enough to the proposed 
site of the colleges to see 
any influx of new com-
merce. "-Scott Healy 

The only area anywhere near Lower Hill-
house chat attracts this type of joint at-
tention is Science Park, off Prospect Street 
near Marsh Hall, a hub of technology 
businesses of interest to the City and Yale 
for many of the same reasons that Yale 
is encouraging biotechnology near the 
Medical School. Should development 
in Science Park begin to attract retail as 
Morand hopes, it will not do students in 
the new colleges much good; it is still far 
enough away chat they might as well walk 
over to Audubon. 

Even if Yale wanted to develop Low-
er Hillhouse itself, it is not clear how it 
would proceed. For one thing, the Uni-
versity controls little property beyond the 
ten million dollar corner of the Prospect-
Sachem-Canal triangle it purchased from 
the City. "There really isn't any chat we 
own. The current space we have wouldn't 
lend itself to [retail)," Morand says, re-
ferring to the Rose Center, a beautiful 
community education center run by Yale 
about a block past the proposed site of 
the colleges, a Yale police station, and a 
Bristol Street building even farther away 
which the University purchased, cleaned 
up, and sold to Beulah Land Develop-
ment Corporation. These developments 
have resulted, in part, from a subdued
