SNAPSHOT 
I PICTUM THt. YANK£.1! DOODLE COFFEF. 
and Sandwich Shop as a predictably ador-
able American diner-it is warm inside. 
the coffee is oily, and a man in a paper 
sailor hat keep~ refilling my cup. lhere 
are sticky leather sears and a chrome-lined 
counter and stains on the cook's white 
apron. I eat French toast and drink choc-
olate milkstukes. There is m~ic playing, 
and the background noise~ of a baseball 
game on the tdevuion. When I come in 
after class, the cook says, •Hey there, Ra-
chel! How're your studi~?· In my imagi-
nation, I am a regular. 

I have never been to the Yankee Doo-
dle Diner and I gu~ I never will. I have 
passed it hundreds of tim~. The last time 
I walked by, rhe mrauram's windows 
were covered from the inside: with light 
blue paper. 

No one could claim its greasy food was 
good for the heart, but many believed it 
to be good for the soul. The Doodle was 
the sort of place that people loved to love, 
and it has become: the sort of place that 
people love to save:. 

Some Yale students treated a visit to irs 
counren like a uip to a shrine or a temple. 
"Though I didn't go a lot, when I did I al-
ways was glad of it and told mysc:lfl ought 
to go more,~ says sophomore: Joshua Sil-
vc:mein, c:xpr~ing the sort of guilt often 
felt by the sporadically religious. Like a 
sacred ritual. the Doodle rep~nted a tie 
to the past. "It was so old school: says 
ilvc:rstein. ~Pretty much the definition of 
old school." 

It seems that everyone ha~ a Doodle 
story. "lbe fim time was the best," recalls 
Senior Ted Gordon. •My friends and I. 
fr~hman year, after pulling an all-nighter, 
vowed to eat breakfast at the Doodle as it 
opened ar 5:30 or six in the morning. We 
walked over in the cold and ordered." 

Ochers spin tales of glurtonous pride. 
On ~ebruary 15. 1999, William Storbier-
ski, who liv~ in the Nc:w Haven area, ate 
25 hamburger~ at the Doodle counter. 
earning a plaque on the resrauranr's \valls. 
When another man beat his record ~everal 
months later, Storbierski went back to the 
Doodle to reclaim hi.!. title. 

Bur memorable and C\en periodic 
visits to the Doodle do nm a regular 
make. Joe Gerhard, a NC\V Ha' en resi-
dent since 1984 and a frc.quenr fiddler at 
Ann2 Liffey's, ~timates rhat he's eaten at 
the Doodle between one and two hun-
dred rimes but claims that "if you do the 
math, you'll see that number still v.ouldn't 
be often enough to qualify me as one of 
the regulars."
