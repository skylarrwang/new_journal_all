PROFILE 
ESPRESSO SELF 
Formerly homeless artist finds his fix at Starbucks. 
THERE ARE HUSDRFDS OF PENS A."D PES• 
cils spread our on the table in from of 
Isaac Canady. "fhcy are a p.Hndc of pl.mk. 
of thin mip~ of color; orne nre metallic. 
and many look like they'w seen bcuer 
days. He stores them all in a large, bat· 
tered Ziploc bag. 
These arc his tools, collected carefully 
and pamstakingly through the }ears, 
through homelessness and starvation, 
mental illness and hospitalization. He 
calls them tools because it is through 
them that he earns an income, unsteady 
as it may be. It is because of them that he 
has food to eat and a place to sleep. \'( ath 
these pens and pencils, he's bu1lt himself 
a home. 
s.~ac's work lines the windows of the 
Smbu~.:ks on the corner of Chapel and 
1-ligh street~. Simply rendered-~tlmost 
primitive in form--the colorful draY. ings

pique the interest of passersby. hue, a 
regular fixture at a corner table inside rhc 
~tore, is himself a curious sight, his long. 
thin body bent over his work as sunlight 
streams in around him, his fingers fUri-
ously dotting at the paper. His cheeks are 
sunken and his gaze is incense, focused. 
His clothes are drab but clean. He b com-
pletely, utterly engros~ed in hb \\Ork. 
Isaac is 48 years old, but he started 
drawing just 15 years ago. He was in the 
hospital at the time-"1 had a lot of •.. is-
sues," he says evash·ely, "a lot of anger and 
rescmmcnr." Later, he clarifies: "I ha'e 
a very abusive history-~exually, physi-
cally, emotionally. Ar the time, my mental 
health was falling to piece..,, my marriage 
was falling to pieces. I had quit m} JOb 
because I was so sick." He and his wtfe 
owned a farmhouse on 99 aero ofland in 
Oxford, Connecticut, bur a fey, years af-
rer quming h1~ job he lo~t everything. His 
job, incidentally, was with the Connecti-
cut Department of Merna I Health. "I was 
in just a~ had a predicament as the people 
I w,ts trt.';lting." hc s.tys, his hands tented 
.uound his mouth. So he had checked 
himsdfin. lor four month,, he had noth-
ing but paper and a few penc1ls to rel1eve 
his boredom. 

THAT DRAWl G CAMP 
ATURALLY TO i'MC 
was both expected and unexpected. He'd 
been invohed m the am since he was just 
a bo), but almost exclushel) m the per· 
fomting am. He had started with piano, 
then mO\ed on to sax, X} lophone, and 
dance. But doodlmg during his hospital 
stay, Isaac found hiS passion. 
.Sketchmg was also .t \\"a) to channel 
and etlm has .tnger. "I pra)ed to my hagh-
er power to help me wnh my issues, and 


little did I know he'd help me through my 
artisdc abiliry. When I started doodling 
that's exactly how the healing process rook 
place," he sap. His art is abstract and or-
ganic, and wrought with symbolism: He 
uses pear-like shapes to represent women, 
roots for history and ancestry, and colors, 
lots of colors, to show the interconnect· 
ednos of people. "My work is nor about 
blacks, it's about all cultures. All of us have 
the same issues, the same problems." 
Being able to safely express his emo-
tions is therapeutic, bur his art is also an 
exercise in sdf-rt.':itrainr. ~I do pointil-
lism-my an form is pointillism-and 
irs an an form rhar rakes a lor of patience. 
And if you Y.ork hard at it, it dn"elops 
patience." Pointillism is a term he learned 
while homebs and drawing on the New 
Haven Green. "This woman came by 
one day and said, 'You don't know what 
you're doing, do you?' And I'm like, I'm 
doing an! And she's like, 'Yeah, but do 
you know what art form you're doing?' 
And I 'aid no. And she said. Tm going 
to \Hite down a couple of thing; for you. 
You look it up. I'll be by here again. you 
let me know what art form it is.' And she 
wrote down Seurat, and a couple of other 
pointillists. Sure enough, I ran into her 
about a month later, and she said, 'Did 
you find out?' And I said, 'Yes, ir's pointil-
lism. Seurar is amazing.' And he is!" 
Isaac doesn't talk much about his four-
year stint of homdessness. "I don't want 
to say too much abour it. Homelessness 
Y.':l.S .. . an inconvenience. It was frighten· 
ing. bcc:ausc people view you as separate 
from <ocien•. Ir W:tl sad at times--but I 


can't say it was the most unhappiest time 
of my life. You know why? Because I'm 
so creative, I adapt to situations, I refuse 
to be miserable." He carried his pens with 
him in a backpack everywhere he went, 
usually drawing on the Green, or in Star-
bucks if it was raining. 
Six years ago, Srarbucks' then-manager 
Rick Ford noticed how Isaac's drawings 
drew people into the store. "I told him 
he could sit here and do his work, if he 
promised to get his act together. And he 
did," Ford said. 
Today, he has an apartment in West-
ville that he pays for by selling his draw-
ings, and he's thinking about going back 
to school. Maybe college, maybe art class-
es. He's also considering finding another 
day job, although that possibility, he says, 
"scares the shit out of me." In the old days, 
he was in Starbucks the minute it opened 
because he had nowhere else to be, but 
now he goes to museums every day, hangs 
out in other coffee shops (he particularly 
likes Koffee on Audubon), watche~ sci-
ence fiction movies-and isn't kicked out 
of a shelter at five in the morning. 
'1 thank God that I 
have the stick-to-it-ive-
ness and the zeal and 
all that to keep going 
regardless of the money, " 
he says. 
His daughter, Chiara Ocean Canady-
just a baby when Isaac was in the hos-
piral-goes to school at the Educational 
Center for the Arts and drops by Star-
buck.~ to visit him on her way home. She 
has long. curly black hair and a light, tan 
complexion-her mother is Italian-and 
though she moves with the shy awkward-
ness of a 15-vear-old, she exudes self-con-
fidence. "She's so focused she scares me, 
I'm just waiting for all hell to break loose," 
Isaac says proudly. "We talk a lot about 
how she can do whatever she wants, and 
doesn't need a man for anything." 
IN A WAY, ISAAC CHOSE TO BE POOR-
chose, even. to be homeless. He recog-
niu:d that he wasn't happy" ith "here he 
was in life and made a drastic decision co 
effect a change. Now, his art has begun 
to gain him recognition within the local 
community. He has sold drawings for as 
much as five hundred dollars and says 
that, because of the diversity of the people • 
who congregate around Yale, his work 
has disseminated to countries all over the 
world. 
But those sales are few and far between, 
and his prosperity is more psychological 
than financial. Still, though life is hard as 
a struggling artist-"! say struggling, not 
srarving, although that's part of it"- he's 
happy. "If I die today, I'm proud of what 
I've accomplished. I thank God that I have 
the stick-to-it-iveness and the zeal and all 
that to keep going regardless of the mon-
ey," he says. "I truly believe that I will be 
a recognized artist one day, probably after 
I die. But I'm going to try co beat that, 
I'm going to try to do it while I'm living." 
Digging his fingers into the pile before 
him, the plastic pens gently clicking in his 
hands, Isaac says. "I may be poor, but my 
work doesn't have to look poor." 
No longer collecting old pens off the 
street, he has added a few more expensive 
cools to his collection-India ink, some 
felt-tipped markers. But he still relies on 
his grimy ballpoints and gel pens and 
highlighters, because they are what he's 
used to, because he knows how co wield 
them well, because he's not the type to 
forget where he came from.
