ART PROJECTS 
Under the steady gaze of West Rock, 
six buildings stand as a rare lifeline for 
struggling artists in an evolving city. Art-
ist Lofts West, better known as ArLoW, 
is a six million dollar enterprise in New 
Haven's Westville neighborhood that pro-
vides affordable living and working space 
for artists of all kinds. The complex cur-
rently hous~ 16 r~ident artists as well as 
a number of independent busine~,es. and 
it cominu~ to expand. 

In 1996, art organizer Thea Buxbaum 
and her husband, sculptor Gar Water-
man. bought a tiny. dilapidated ware-
ho~ from the City for one dollar (the 
City's alternative, demolishing the build-
ing, could have cost $30.000). Buxbaum 
and Waterman converted the warehouse 
into a set of impressh·ely modern apart· 
ments and studios. Inspired by this sue-
c~sful renovation and sympathetic to the 
obstacles young arrists face, the couple 
began exploring ways to assist w~rville's 
arrisric community. On the advice of a 
tenant's development consultant mother, 
Buxbaum and her husband purchased five 
more buildings in the area and set ro work 
on renovations. 

E.1ch renovated building has a similar 
layout: a first Roor occupied by a small 
business or art space, such as a tennis 
shop. a clothing score, or a pottery-paint-
ing workshop for children. The artists 
chemselve~ live above th~e business~. 
Along with a few painters, their eclectic 
ranks include an opera singer, an upright 
bassist, a Rautist, and a tenant Buxbaum 
calls a "renaissance man," who paints, 
writes, sings, photographs, and plays sev-
eral insrrumenrs. 

Buxbaum seeks grants from the City, 
Stare, and private sourc~ ro keep her hous-
ing units affordable. Prospective tenants 
must earn below 50, 60, or 80 percent of 
the neighborhood median, depending on 
the unit, in order to rent an apartment in 
ArLoW People are nor forced out if their 
income incr~s. however. "We wanted 
to have unit~ where people could never be 
displaced," she explains. 

In addition ro cultivating a commu-
nity arcs scene, Buxbaum is committed to 
maintaining her neighborhood's eclectic 
character. Westville is as quirky as Bux-
baum her.self-a woman who has never 
cut her three-year-old son's hair, crafting 
a rebellious look that would make Keith 
Richards blush-and she aims to keep ir 
that way. One of her motivations for buy-
ing up abandoned storefronts was to pre-
vent large chains like Dunkin' Donuts and 
CYS from moving in. She discriminates 
carefully when deciding which business~ 
to allow into her properri~. and the r~ult 
is the perpetuation of the neighborhood's 
amy reputation. 

Economically. w~rville is a particu-
larly diverse neighborhood. According to 
Buxbaum, the portion that li~ south of 
\X'halley Avenue has the high~t average 
income of any area of ~ew Hayen, while 
the northern half has the lowest. Bux-
baum, who~e renovated studio and ho~ 
is .situated on the troubled northern side.

meated the area when she first moved in.

play in the streets," she describes. One of 
her goals is to bridge the gap between the 
t\vo disparate halves of the neighborhood, 
and ArLo \Y./, with buildings on both sides 
of the proverbial tracks, helps accomplish 
this objective. 

Buxbaum's tenants are enthusiastic 
about their living situations. Jonny Rodg-
ers, a guitarist and vocalist for the band 
,\1ighty Purple, shares a Bar with his wife 
Desirca. He lists the advantages of living 
in ArLoW: "I can play very loud music 
and no one complains; room for a laundry 
machine, a dishwasher, heat in the winter! 
\Y./e love all of these!" Bassist Adam Kubo-
ta is equally appreciative of the low rent 
and high tolerance for late-night music. 

Crowning the list of advantages is the 
ease and frequency of collaborative proj-
ects among ArLo \Y./ residents. Kubota 
has jammed and performed with Rodg-
ers. Two other residents, John Bent and 
]emma Williams, run a gallery out of their 
apartment, and Kubota provides musical 
accompaniment at their art shows. Re-

Pas~ersby were puzzled, yet many were 
undoubtedly reassured by the reminder of 
Westville's abiding quirkiness.
