• ·of sign languag~ int~rpr~ting, Godwin 
not~. At on~ time, rh~ majority of inter-
pr~ers were unpaid friends and relatives 
_ .of deaf people, and they often rook a pa-
ternalistic approach ro interpreting. trans-
lating only what they thought the deaf 
person might want to hear. In the past 
thirty years. however, national organiza-
tions, training programs, and certification 
t~ts have created standards for profes-
sional interpreting, as well as injury pre-
venrion recomm~ndarions. Godwin now 
performs a ~ries of hand exerci:>es before 
every se~ion to avoid repeririv~ motion 
injury, a condition that affects as many as 
87o/o of peopl~ in the .field. 

Baker-Gibbs found interpreting ser-
vices at Yale to b~ much better than those 
at most other colleges she considered, 
and far better than those of her Canadian 
public high school. The biggest problem 
she encounters is when, due ro last-min-
ute scheduling problems, no interpreter is 
• able ro show up ro one of her classes. She 
describes these days as ~difficult," and says 
that without the abiliry ro get notes from 
ocher stud~nr~, she'd be lost. York shares 
Baker-Gibbs' concern, calling such situa-
tions "my biggest regret" and expressing a 
desire to "look at different wap to make 
sure that spot is always filled." 

For Yale's deaf students, sign language 
interpreting services cannot be successful 
without the cooperation of professors. 
Baker-Gibbs. Godwin, and York agree 
that, for the most part, professors are sen-
sitive to deaf students' needs. The most 
understanding professors might include 
interpreters on class panlisrs, let them 
know in advance what material the class 
will cover, and pay attention ro the visual 
s~up of the classroom. 

Godwin views part of his job as edu-
cating hearing students on how to accom-
modate their deaf peers by, for example, 
always addressing the student rather than 
the interpreter. 

"Deafness is an invisible disability," 
Godwin ob~erves. "They don't have white 
canes. they don't have dogs." He's always 
~r to interpret at non-academic events 
like master's teas and housing meetings 
beca~ thoc ap~ces broaden stu-
dents' exposure ro inrerpredng. "Only by 
seeing deaf people in different venues," he 
says ... do people become aware that there 
are deaf people around them."

According ro Baker-Gibbs, most stu-
dents love watching the interpreters. "It's 
cool. It's like someone walking up to you 
and saying, 'How do you speak French? 
It's so beautiful.' It's really nice.·· She paus· 
es a few seconds. "Also a little bit n.1·ive."
