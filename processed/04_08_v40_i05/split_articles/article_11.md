POINTS OF DEPARTURE 
SCUBA LIBRE 
Instructor Lee Livingston smacks his fist 
against his palm, and a resounding pop 
carries through the water. Hearing this 
signal for Look out!, we turn slowly to 
identify its source, careful to draw our 
gear tight about our bodies. With 62 
pounds per cubic foot of water above us, 
every motion must be gentle and precise. 
“Look at me!” Livingston growls, poking 
two fingers emphatically towards his face. 
Silent and docile as manatees, we obey 
and await further instruction. 


At half past noon every Sunday, I head 
to a classroom in the basement of Payne 
Whitney Gym to find Livingston, a lean 
man bristling with a gray beard, drawing 
charts and graphs on the whiteboard. For 
$450 and one semester’s worth of Sun-
days, he is teaching me to be a certified 
scuba diver. 


At the end of the class, we will perform 
open-water check-out dives in the cold, 
murky water off Massachusetts and be-
come certified to dive almost anywhere in 
the world. “Then you can dive the rest of 
your life in the blue, warm waters of the 
Caribbean, if that’s your style!” Livingston 
snorts. 


It isn’t just that: Livingston has done hun-
dreds of dives off the East Coast, where 
the waters hide centuries of sunken trad-
ing and naval vessels. He has explored 
shipwrecks both professionally and for 
personal interest, and emphasizes that 
he’s always “very respectful when I go 
down there. Some of those sites are also 
grave sites; there’s a lot of history out in 
the ocean.” He has, however, hauled up 
his share of sunken treasure. “I picked up 
some silver plates off the Bianca C,” he 
boasts, referring to a well-known wreck 
near the island of Grenada. 


Payne Whitney’s version of scuba train-
ing is less Pirates of the Caribbean and more 
YMCA. After dry training, we get ready 
to dive in a swimming pool, trooping to 
the trailer to retrieve a Buoyancy-Com-
pensator vest, a 16-pound weight belt, a 
wet suit, an octopus-like set of tubes with 
our breathing apparatus, and a bright 
yellow scuba tank. I stand at the edge of 
the Kiphuth Exhibition Pool, neon green 
ropes dangling over the rim, watching 
other pairs of divers kick to deeper water 
like shiny black frogs. I look to my buddy, 
a second-year School of Management stu-
dent named Rachel, before bending my 
knees, pressing my goggles to my face, 
and flipping head first into the water. 


Although the bottom of a swimming 
pool seems the least interesting place on 
Earth to explore, Kiphuth’s unnaturally 
blue water has the advantages of high 
visibility and of being close to open air. 


In the pool, we deflate our BC’s, allowing 
our weight-belts to drag us to the 
bottom. There, Livingston demonstrates 
an underwater skill and corrects us as we 
practice it in turn, trying to acclimate 
ourselves to our aquatic surroundings. We 
learn to clear a flooded mask of water and 
to retrieve our breathing regulators. We 
even remove our entire scuba tanks and 
then strap them back on. To prepare for 
a worst-case scenario, we practice buddy-
breathing, a skill no one will need un-
less someone’s “fool of a diving buddy is 
numbskull enough to screw up and not 
check his air,” Livingston grimaces. We 
laugh uneasily but know he harbors no 
illusions. His scoldings shock us into at-
tentiveness far quicker than the imagined 
dangers of open water. 


Learning to keep cool is a critical skill 
for a scuba diver and the primary goal 
of our Payne Whitney class. To receive 
certification, we must pass a written test 
and accomplish certain tasks in the open 
ocean to demonstrate comfort in the 
environment. Although he has taught 
diving at many universities, Livingston 
does not often have college students in his 
classes. “It’s usually the average Joe Blow 
off the street,” he says. Our own class 
includes Yale undergraduate and gradu-
ate students studying various disciplines, 
middle-aged locals, and even a high 
school student whose grandfather wanted 
a diving buddy. 


Having heard Livingston’s signal for at-
tention, we collect in an expectant circle 
around him. He makes a sudden frantic 
slashing movement across his neck. He 
rips his regulator from his mouth and 
bubbles stream from his lips like jelly-
fish shooting for the surface. Livingston’s 
wife kicks toward him, her pink flippers 
flashing through the water. Livingston 
grips her vest and grabs the cord of her 
regulator, allowing her to take one deep 
breath before pulling the regulator into 
his own mouth. He breathes freely twice 
and hands the regulator back to her. Put-
ting his own back into his mouth, he 
straightens up and points to me. I turn to 
my buddy and make the same motions, 
sharing air for two breaths at a time until 
we have a steady rhythm. 


As I drag myself out of the pool after 
three hours, I’m cold, tired, and only 
slightly traumatized. Sure, I’ve seen pho-
tos of sea anemones and brain-coral and 
parrot-fish, I’ve watched James Bond fight 
underwater battles with spear-guns. But 
what will happen when we’re tossed into 
the big blue for check-out dives in April? 
It can’t be that different from the bottom 
of a pool, I tell myself. Just more fish.
