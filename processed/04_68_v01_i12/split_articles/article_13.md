This particular war 
by A. Dwight Culler 
"I was in the Civilian Public Program for 
C.O.'s during World War II," says Dwight 
Culler, director of graduate studies in 
English. "After chopping down trees in a 
former Civilian Conservation Corps camp 
in New Hampshire, I spent two years as an 
attendant in a mental hospital in Middle-
town, Connecticut. 


"Later I was sent to a camp inN orthern 
California for 'bad boys' because I had 
sent an impertinent letter to the super-
intendent of the mental hospital complain-
ing about the food. I spent that winter 
digging one garbage pit two feet square. 
There was great resistance to the Selective 
Service System in this camp and very 
little work was done.'' 


History repeats itself curiously. Almost 
thirty years ago I was a graduate student 
at Yale and was faced by the same problem 
that now confronts my students. The 
lottery had turned up my number early 
and I had registered as a conscientious 
objector. I was not a member of one of the 
historic peace churches (though my father 
had been in his youth) and I was not even 
much of a churchgoer. I had merely 
decided I could not do this thing and 
would not. 


I have often tried since then to dis-
entangle the elements of moral idealism, 
intellectual aloofness and pure pigheaded-
ness that went into this decision, but have 
found myself unable to do so. Enough 
to say that I decided. 


Now, however, I see students who are 
just as religious as I was, and quite as 
sincere, hesitate to become objectors be-
cause they are not sure they faJI within 
the definition of the act. Their objections 
may not be religious enough and they may 
object only to this particular war, not to 
war in general. I am thus aware that I had 
a great advantage. Whereas I was con-
fronted by a good, clean, sensible war and 
so knew that I was against war in general, 
they are confronted by one so horrible 
and absurd that they imagine it is only 
this particular war that they object to. 


I think that they are wrong. I think 
that when they reflect on what they see in 
the television sequences they will realize 
that even if this were not happening in a 
sector of the world in which we have no 
business to be and for a reason which has 
long ago been lost sight of, it would still 
be horribly, horribly wrong. I think that 
their feeling that they are not against war 
in general is due to an insufficient ability to 
conceive of the nature of war. Any war 
is exactly like this one: something they 
could not participate in without being 
brutalized, something for which they could 
not come back and live with themselves 
as decent, humane people. 


Still, if on reflection they find they are 
not against war in general but only against 
this particular war, then the Jaw says that 
they are not conscientious objectors. For 
thirty years I have meditated on this 
statement and wondered what it means. 


As far as I can see, it means that, accord-
ing to the Selective Service System, God 
thinks in abstractions. He forbids only 
classes of acts, not particular acts. Of 
course, we can all think of a famous in-
stance to the contrary, in the second 
chapter of Genesis, where God declares, 
"Of all the fruits that grow in the garden 
thou mayst eat freely, but of this particular 
fruit thou mayst not eat"; and Antigone, I 
believe, did not have an aversion to 
unburied bodies in general. 


We all realize, of course, that the intent 
of the directive is that the individual 
should not exercise his private judgment 
in determining which laws be shall obey. 
But the conscientious objector bas already 
done that. He has said, this law I will 
obey, that not. I will stop at traffic lights, 
I will not go to war. We know too that 
classes of acts differ in the degree of their 
generality and in whether they are real 
entities or arbitrary divisions. 


Just as God might have preserved his 
reputation for abstraction by forbidding 
all the fruit in the garden, or only all 
the apples, or all the Mcintosh apples, or 
all the apples on that particular Mcintosh 
tree, or all parts of that particular Mc-
Intosh apple, so the C.O. can object to all 
war, or onJy to all unjust wars, or to all 
wars of colonialism, or to all wars against 
yellow races striving to fulfill their national 
aspirations, or to all Vietnam wars, or to 
all acts in this particular Vietnam war. If 
he really wishes to preserve his character 
for generality, let it be the last to which 
be objects, though I myself would say that 
he is not confronted by an Aristotelian 
category but by a particular situation. 


But what, then, if he isn't sufficiently 
religious? Philosophically, the basis for 
conscientious objection is the recognition 
on the part of the state that if two duties, 
one civic and one religious, come in con-
flict, it is the latter that takes precedence. 


Historically, the idea goes back to 
seventeenth-century conceptions of reli-
gious toleration. The problem in applying 
so simple a theory arises, of course, from 
the fact that, although the state acknowl-
edges that it must give way before a 
religious duty, it takes it upon itself to 
define what religion is and what kinds of 
duties it may enjoin. (It would not dream 
of making an establishment of religion, 
but it does not mind theologizing a little 
on the side.) It is not absolutely rigid in 
these matters and some latitude is left to 
the theological predilections of the Local 
Board. But in general, apart from the 
fact that God must speak in abstractions, 
they prefer that he be a Person, that he 
communicate chiefly to people in 
churches, and that he discuss the matter 
of war largely with Quakers, Mennonites 
and Brethren. 


In the last war I spent three and a half 
years with Quakers, Mennonites and 
Brethren and came to have a great affec-
tion and respect for them. But there is no 
question that they are the relic-the last 
two especially--of obscure sixteenth- and 
seventeenth~entury sects who are com-
pletely outside the main stream of modern 
life. The Selective Service System buys 
itself great mileage, in terms of a reputa-
tion for religious tolerance, by granting 
exemptions to these tiny, almost non-
existent sects. 


At the same time it in effect declares 
that no one in America can have a con-
science, at least on the subject of war, 
unless he lives in the intellectual back-
waters. It takes no account of what 
happened to religion in the twentieth 
century and comes as close to denying real 
religious freedom as any democratic gov-
ernment has ever done. Its tokenism in 
recognizing the Quakers, the Mennonites 
and the Brethren is a supreme example 
of political cunning. 


This cunning has worked so well that 
young people now forget that Selective 
Service has nothing to do with determining 
who is or who is not a conscientious 
objector. True, they frame the legal defi-
nition and decide who gets the exemptions, 
but a conscientious objector defines him-
self. He defines himself by his own act. 
He is anyone who stands up on his two 
legs and says, out of sincere conscientious 
conviction, this thing I will not do. It 
may well be that he will go to jail for 
saying so--and no one should register as 
a conscientious objector who is not pre-
pared for this eventuality-but he 
is a C.O. 


In the last war, if my memory serves 
me, there were about 12,000 objectors 
in the camps and about 12,000 in jail. 
Legally, the latter were not C.O.'s, but by 
their willingness to suffer for their beliefs 
they proved that they were; they were 
so listed statistically, and many of them 
were later released to the camps. 


Whether they were against all wars 
or only that particular one I don't know. 
It so happens that most of us are only 
of age to fight one war in our lifetime, 
and that we must either fight or refuse. 
The others are a hypothetical question.
