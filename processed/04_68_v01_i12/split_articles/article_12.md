The village in 
the Vietnamese war 
by Samuel Popkin 
Dennis Duncanson, Government and 
Revolution in Vietnam, Oxford, 1968. 
Ward Just, To What End: Report 
from Vietnam, Houghton Mifflin, 1968. 
There are two ways to study Vietnam, as 
history or as theater: 


Dennis Duncanson spent six years in 
Vietnam as a member of the British 
Advisory Mission to the Vietnamese 
government. A veteran of the British 
Colonial Service, he was Director of 
Chinese Education in Malaya. He 
understands Vietnamese bureaucracy and 
reads Chinese, Vietnamese and French. 


Ward J.ust spent 18 months in Vietnam 
as a reporter for the Washington Post, and 
his reporting was honored by the Overseas 
Press Club. He understands American 
bureaucracy and has read Kafka, The 
Good Soldier Schweik and Catch-22. 


In the long run Duncanson's book will 
be a major contribution to modern 
Vietnamese history. It is solid and well 
documented and has excellent historical 
summaries. But people today don't want 
facts, they want their beliefs reinforced. 


Just's book suits the mood of today. 


Duncanson seems to think the war could 
have been won if only American strategy 
had been better planned. Just gives the 
impression hat this could never have 
happened. The sense of urgency, threat or 
commitment was simply not strong enough 
to unite the American effort. Americans 
could not even agree on terms; as Just says, 
"It was a question of which Jesuit was in 
charge." 


Mr. Duncanson is an honest hawk. Even 
looking back at the awesome toll the 
American effort has exacted in Vietnam, 
he favors an independent, non-
communist South Vietnam and upholds 
the domino theory. But he is fair in all he 
presents and thus gives a telling and 
detailed analysis of the debacle in South 
Vietnam. Except for the American intent 
to keep South Vietnam afloat, he finds very 
little that is right, either with the 
Americans or with the various South 
Vietnamese governments. 


Speaking before the Fulbright 
committee, John Kenneth Galbraith once 
remarked that "if we had never gone to 
Vietnam, that country would today be 
enjoying the obscurity it so richly 
deserves." The sad fact is, however, that 
we did go to Vietnam and it still enjoyed 
obscurity. When we first became involved, 
no one knew or cared about the country, 
and no one seems to have understood the 
complex tangle of factions and interests 
we were entering. As Duncanson notes, 
during the Diem era, 
the ramshackle edifice of factional 
allegiance, vested interest, and 
patronage, resting on the shifting sands 
of foreign aid, opposed to the 
Communist threat, not a shield of 
national unity, but a host of 'internal 
contradictions', waiting to be 
exploited . ... 


From the beginning the two pillars of 
American support for Diem were the 
building of a strong national army and 
economic aid to raise the standard of 
living. There was also some technical 
assistance for particular government 
efforts. The crux of the failure of the 
cumulative US effort, Duncanson notes, 
was want of coordination and direction in 
the application of aid and advice. "Defense 
freedom" was a slogan, not a policy or a 
program of action. 


Vietnam needed a leader who could 
understand the government as a whole and 
Samuel Popkin, who spent ten months in 
Vietnam, is a lecturer in Political Science 
and is currently writing a book on the 
Vietnamese village. 


see the relation of all the parts. "Diem and 
Nhu were not of that calibre," says 
Duncanson. But the US stood back, 
keeping up its commitment, treating 
" 'defense of freedom' as a problem 
separate from the governing of Vietnam." 


Duncanson does not blame the failure 
of Diem and his American support on 
subversion, either from North or South. 
Whether it was in our national interest or 
not, we did commit ourselves, and" ... it 
was precisely ... to make South Vietnam 
viable to the point of resisting aggression, 
that the programme had been embarked 
on." 


Looking at Duncanson's review of the 
Diem era, the reader finds it hard to see 
how Diem lasted as long as be did. Diem 
never had the support of the various sects, 
factions and parties that make South 
Vietnam so complicated. He was in the 
position of having to guard against coup 
and revolution at the same time, an 
impossibie situation even for a more 
capable person. 


In a sense Diem had to choose between 
guarding the state and guarding the people. 
He chose to guard the state and in the end 
lost both. Intelligence services were 
fragmented and spent their time watching 
each other, not the spreading of VietCong 
domination over rural areas. The military 
chain of command was fragmented, and 
officers were appointed on the basis of 
loyalty, not competence. 


Nowadays, the liberal 
oversimplification is that Diem's 
oppression and tyranny were responsible 
for the ever growing VietCong strength in 
rural areas. The truth, while no more 
complimentary to Diem, is much more 
complicated. The resentment directed 
toward Diem stemmed largely from the 
way he reacted to Viet Cong presence in 
a village; his reactions were often worse 
than the VietCong actions. 


The Vietnamese village, as Duncanson 
shows, bas always been the traditional 
breeding ground for revolution and 
anarchy, and neither Diem nor any of his 
successors has changed that situation. 


Diem believed, as do many Vietnamese 
and Americans even today, that the 
traditional village, with its ancient 
institutions, was the key to stability and 
harmony. All evidence contradicts this. 


When I talked to Americans in Saigon 
and urban Vietnam they seemed to 
overlook some basic facts of village life. 
The village was never a happy, cohesive 
community full of singing peasants. If 
Diem's view of the village was realistic, 
then so was Fiddler on the Roof with its 
happy, smiling Cossacks. No institutions 
of law and order, which would provide the 
peasant with redress for grievances, were 
developed. Justice was the province of 
village elders, and any problem they 
couldn't handle went unsolved. 


Government by elders was conservative 
and narrow. It did not build national 
identification and it provided no careers 
for young, ambitious peasants. The only 
place in rural Vietnam where a peasant 
had an opportunity for a career with a 
chance of advancement was with the Viet 
Cong. Under the old system peasants were 
supposed to be happy farmers; they 
weren't supposed to want the corrupting 
careers of modern life. 


Besides the lack of rural career 
opportunities and the absence of real law 
and order, life in the villages was boring, 
especially before the recent transistor 
boom. The VietCong had easy access to 
many villages because they brought 
minstrels and puppet shows, not because 
they brought revolution. 


As the Viet Cong's strength increased, 
every reaction to their activities served to 
increase their strength still more. 


Duncanson thus can call Vietnam a 
"symbiotic revolution." The reaction to 
VietCong progress in the villages was 
military action by an army under urban 
officers who had no identification with 
rural peasants and no reliable information 
to guide them. 


In this situation, ARVN (The Army of 
the Republic of Vietnam) did what it 
was trained to do. It went chasing around 
on big operations, walking over the 
villages in search of guerrillas. This was a 
crucial mistake. The VietCong strength 
was not in the guerrillas but in the local 
"precinct workers" or cadres, who worked 
in the villages to develoP. a belief among 
the peasants that the VietCong, whatever 
their faults, were better to the peasants 
than the government army. As long as 
ARVN was so destructive, it was a good 
idea for the peasant to fortify his village. 


While ARVN was cautiously stepping 
around the bamboo spikes, the peasant 
could hide his chickens. 


Things got worse as ARVN became 
more and more frustrated. 


Diem didn't want casualties, and the 
Americans wanted progress. The result: 
more artillery was used and the spiral of 
escalation ascended. Though the civilian 
death toll from the ever mounting use of 
planes and artillery over the years was 
nowhere near what one might expect, 
artillery lost the war. The flow of refugees 
from shelled villages complicated all 
problems. Peasants soon learned to shelter 
themselves from air and artillery attacks 
in their villages, but the villages were 
being shot up. Many ambitious peasants, 
the ones around whom the rural 
government could best be built, took off 
for the cities. Others flocked to distant 
villages. A vicious climate of distrust came 
to exist where no peasant knew whom he 
could trust. And, of course, large numbers 
joined the Viet Cong -
some because 
they hated the government for its cruelties, 
but most because they were afraid of city 
life and had no place else to go. 


By the time Diem was overthrown, the 
Viet Cong were well entrenched with a 
good grass roots organization throughout 
the country. This was their strength and 
always has been. The large VietCong 
units, including those of P A VN (People's 
Army of Vietnam), have served as a 
bullfighter's cape, keeping the Americans 
busy chasing around in the central 
highlands and near the demilitarized zone, 
far from the villages upon whose support 
the VietCong depend. 


Between American domination on one 
hand and the segmentation of their own 
society on the other, the governments 
since Diem have been no better. Every 
officer seems to fancy himself a Bonaparte. 


One new American welfare program after 
another, which couldn't help being badly 
administered, added to the chaos. 


Vietnamese bureaucracy was caught in 
the position of having to administer a 
series of unrealistic programs, with the 
quality of performance becoming 
successively lower. But the programs 
really did raise the overall standard of 
living- including that of the VietCong 
who began to use cement-lined tunnels. 


This is where Just is at his best-
describing the air of unreality surrounding 
the American military and civilian efforts.
