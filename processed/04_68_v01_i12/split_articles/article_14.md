Some teachers were skeptical of the 
alternative proposals. "There was an 
immense scrambling for facts without 
sitting back and thinking about what 
things meant," said one committee 
member. Other teachers, mostly junior 
faculty, thoughrthe patchwork of 
alternatives was impractical, an excuse 
for not moving. One teacher said to a 
colleague: "They're nothing but half-
thought-out, slick, Madison Avenue 
money-raisers." 


The alumnae came back to Vassar for 
their annual reunions at the June 
Commencement. It was hot, and 
conversation was only about the Vassar-
Yale affiliation. Alumnae officers 
repeatedly attacked the move. Simpson, 
recalling his earlier statement about 
betraying "the essence" of Vassar by 
abandoning neutrality, told associates that 
alumnae officers were misusing their 
offices. The officers replied that Simpson 
was misusing his. 


The alumnae also gave birth to two of 
the most savage rumors that appeared 
during the entire affair. The first was that 
Alan Simpson was using the Vassar 
presidency and the New Haven move to 
become president of Yale, after.Brewster 
departs for the Senate. The other was that 
Yale had tried to get Connecticut College 
to move to Yale before asking Vassar. No 
one likes to be second choice, least of all 
Vassar alumnae. 


The evidence for the Conn College 
rumor was scanty. At a cocktail party in路 
New York in 1964, Brewster had indeed 
asked a Conn College trustee, "Why don't 
you move that school of yours to New 
Haven?" And in his 1966 commencement 
address at Conn, Brewster had cracked 
that, no, it was not true Yale was moving 
to New London. But there had been no 
official contact. In May, 1967, Evalyn 
Clark, a history professor at Vassar, asked 
Charles Shane, president of Conn College, 
why Conn had turned down the move to 
Yale. "Well, we didn't take it too 
seriously," Shane replied. 


Simpson was chagrined at the treatment 
he was getting from the Vassar ladies; but 
he remained confident that he could 
convince people. Some associates said be 
should stop pushing the affiliation, lest it 
split Vassar apart and do irreparable 路 
damage to the school and to his 
presidency. But, like Sisyphus, Simpson 
persisted. 


The administrations of the two schools 
thought they could please alumnae and 
trustees by taking them on a tour of Yale 
and the proposed site for Vassar in New 
Haven. 


The University owned most of the 40 
acres along Prospect St., and planned to 
buy the Culinary Institute of America 
to make the entire area between the cam-
pus and the Divinity School into the new 
home of Vassar. Yale officials were en-
thusiastic about the site, sloping up a hill 
and studded with trees, which they con-
sidered the best in New Haven- much 
better than the area they bad once con-
sidered on Dixwell Avenue behind the 
gymnasium. 


As the trustees ambled about, however, 
they were thinking about the rundown 
neighborhood on nearby Winchester 
A venue, where racial disturbances had 
taken place that summer. They also 
objected to the proximity of Olin 
Mathieson's Winchester Rifle plant, and 
worried that a huge highway was going to 
cut Vassar off from the rest of the 
University. 


Perhaps, Yale said, but the highway 
would be sunk below ground level. 


Some of the trustees fretted about the 
"postage-stamp size" of the site, even 
though the present Vassar campus proper 
occupies only about 100 out of the 1000 
acres the college owns. The Yale officials 
kept praising the beauty of the site. On 
one of the trips, ~am Chauncey pointed to 
a tree. "Look at that huge silver beech 
tree," he said to one of Vassar's female 
trustees. "Tell me, do you have any trees 
as beautiful as that one at Vassar?" 
"No," she snapped. 


The trustees were served sumptuous 
luncheons at Brewster's house, along with 
路a platter of promises -
that the area 
would be well-lit and weU-patrolled, and 
that Vassar would get her own library 
building and other facilities. But as far as 
the trustees were concerned, none of New 
Raven's delights could match Vassar's 
pastoral home. 


During the summer, Kingman Brewster 
went sailing with Alan Simpson at 
Simpson's retreat in Little Compton, 
Rhode Island. At the same time, the Study 
Committee Staff, which in June had 
assigned sections of its material for 
writing, began piecing together its final 
report, amid disagreement over whether 
the report itself should advocate the 
move. 


Nell Eurich urged that its bulk remain 
neutral, with expressions of desirability 
restricted to covering letters from the two 
presidents. Mrs. Eurich had been 
gradually solidifying her position at 
Vassar, and she was eventually the only 
member of the Joint Staff to oppose the 
move (although she never publicly 
路admitted it). Because of her efforts, the 
final report contained no advocacy, no 
general principles -
only a lot of dry 
figures, charts and proposed 
arrangements. 


When the drafts were completed, the 
Staff of the Vassar-Yale Study Committee 
met in New Haven for final discussion. 
From August 29 at ten in the morning to 
noon the following day, the participants 
went over, word for word, the contents of 
the report. Kingman Brewster led the 
meeting and, with pencil in hand, took 
suggestions and corrected the final copy. 
When it was completed, the report was 
typed up, multilithed and bound at the 
Yale Press in loose-leaf notebooks, which 
went to the trustees of both schools and 
selected faculty members at Yale. The 
Vassar faculty never got a chance to look 
at the report, even though it was in the 
library at Yale, until after the trustees' 
decision. 


Staff members were generally relieved 
to be finished, and Yale people looked 
forward to standing aside while Vassar 
made its decision. Brewster told friends 
he thought it was "a damn good report." 


But Yale knew it was up to Vassar now. 
The Vassar trustees also received the 
report of the New Dimensions 
Committee. With its general projections 
for Vassar's future, it seemed far more 
imaginative than the meticulous but cut-
and-dried Vassar-Yale Study report. 


At this point a few people were 
beginning to claim that the move to NeW


Haven would actually be a conservative 
answer to Vassar's problems. In the 
October Alumnae Magazine, Dean Nell 
Eurich sampled faculty opinion and found 
that "the essence of the Vassar education" 
was its creativity and originality, its 
democratic and pioneering spirit and its 
commitment to teaching and to the 
individual student- things one wouldn't 
find so easily in a university. That same 
month, in a speech to alumnae, she quoted 
an article in Daedalus that said the trend 
of the future was toward privacy, 
independence, peace and quiet. This too 
obviously meant Poughkeepsie. 


Vassar's trustees, half of them alumnae, 
convened eight times that fall, sometimes 
in Poughkeepsie, sometimes in New York 
City at John Wilkie's 73rd Street 
apartment. The sessions were long and 
tedious and inconclusive. As time went on, 
the Vassar-Yale Study was becoming 
increasingly irrelevant to the discussions, 
for the trustees were arguing over 
desirability, not feasibility. 


Before the trustees made their decision, 
Simpson and Wilkie mailed letters to all 
the alumnae saying they would "consult" 
with the faculty under terms of the 
Governance before finally agreeing to 
make the move. But the statement was 
clearly hedged, not quite guaranteeing the 
professors veto power. 


Meanwhile, alumna Dorothy 
Seiberling's opposition to the New Haven 
move had come to the attention of the 
editors of Life, who asked her to write a 
story on the Vassar-Yale Study. Pleased, 
she sent to Vassar a photographer, who 
was told by Vassar officials not to talk to 
anyone. Information, he was told, would 
come later when the report was 
completed. 


Feeling rebuffed, Miss Seiberling, an 
art editor, obtained most of her 
information from public accounts and 
private conversations with Vassar faculty 
members. Some professors told her they 
bad been discouraged from talking to 
outsiders; several told her the rumor about 
Conn College. 


She talked to no one at Yale except 
students and some art department faculty 
because she felt she would get only the 
"official line" there. 


Headlined "How Dare They Do It?", 
her article was a ranting polemic against 
the move that suggested a conspiracy 
between Brewster and Simpson. It was 
enlivened by a photo of the projected 
Vassar site in New Haven, shot so that the 
Olin Mathieson gun factory and its smoke 
loomed directly over Vassar's proposed 
doorstep. 


The article alleged that Vassar got Yale 
on the rebound from Connecticut College. 
Charles Shane, president of Conn, was 
asked about the charge during lunch. He 
sputtered with rage and denied it 
Vehemently. Later, he mailed a letter to 
Life saying it wasn't true. Life did not 
print the letter. 


A few days before the Seiberling story 
appeared, Brewster, somewhat concerned, 
bad called his friend, Hedley Donovan, 
Editor-in-Chief of Time-Life. Donovan 
laid he knew nothing about it. When 
Brewster saw the story, he was livid. "This 
1rouldn't have happened if Harry Luce 
"ere still alive," a Yale official said. 


At Vassar, there was an ambivalent 
tion to the article. Many- for the 
rd -expressed regret that the article 
appeared. Nevertheless it seemed to 
ieve tensions that had been building for 
ost a year. All the apprehensions, even 
if overstated, were now out in the open, 
in print. 


The Seiberling article, in giving form to 
the opposition, helped speed the Vassar-
Yale affiliation, once so fair and soon so 
battered, to a merciful death. At the 
alumnae meeting in Poughkeepsie in mid-
October, passions were strangely subdued, 
as though everything had been said and 
there was nothing more to do. Interest 
turned to Franny Taft's husband's 
mayoralty campaign in Cleveland. 


Fj.nally, in November, there was one 
last effort at compromise that brought 
Simpson and Brewster together. 


Eight days later, the lingering came to 
an end. 


November 20, when the Vassar trustees 
took the final vote and Alan Simpson read 
his statement three times, was a Monday. 
Two days later everyone went home for 
Thanksgiving. Before she left, one student 
received a note from Simpson. He thanked 
her for her optimism about the affiliation 
and then concluded, "Now, let's get going." 


When the girls came back, the report of 
the Vassar-Yale Study Group was 
available in the library and the New 
Dimensions Committee's office. It could 
have been a curio from a thousand years 
ago. Few took the time to look at it. 


The following Tuesday about thirty 
girls gathered at the home of Mr. and 
Mrs. Simpson for a buffet supper. The 
college deans were also there, although 
Nell Eurich, spilling over with apologies, 
arrived late. Over sherry in the living 
room, Simpson chatted with the girls. He 
was in good spirits; the conversation was 
about exactly how Vassar could get going 
right now. He wanted to hear what the 
girls thought was wrong and what 
suggestions they could offer to improve 
Vassar. 


There were already plans to talk about. 
A few days before, Simpson bad said, "If 
we haven't produced some kind of college 
for men within five years, I'd be a very 
surprised and disappointed man." Now 
there was discussion in Simpson's living 
room of curricular changes and easing of 
social rules, talk about exchanges with 
men's schools, about the proposed 
graduate institutes, and even about the 
new dining hall plans that had been 
shelved a year before. 


Everyone talked about the options, but 
no one mentioned the obstacles. For one 
thing, the money. For another, the Vassar 
progressives who want change in 
Poughkeepsie and the traditionalists who 
like Vassar more or less the way it is no 
longer share a common cause. 


The talk went on pleasantly, as people 
passed along the buffet. No one wanted to 
believe that the trustees might have made 
the wrong choic.e, that Vassar might be in 
serious trouble. People found chairs and 
couches where they could balance their 
plates on their knees. One girl, sitting in a 
corner, caught sight of a pile of 
photographs on a bureau. Picking 
through them, she came upon a picture 
that bad been taken off Little Compton, 
Rhode Island, during the summer. It 
showed Simpson and Brewster on 
Simpson's yacht, smiling under the sun. 
"The conspirators," joked the girl. 


Mrs. Simpson, nearby,laukhed. "Alan 
and Kingman- the conspirators." 


Across the room, Alan Simpson was 
talking with the girls about Vassar's 
daunting and dazzling future in 
Poughkeepsie.
