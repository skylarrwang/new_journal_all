"Remember when Vassar was going to move to 
New Haven?"

"Yes."

"You want to know the whole intricate, messy, detail-ridden 
story inside out?"

"Yes. Yes."

"Read on."


On an overcast morning last November 
12, Alan Simpson, seventh President of 
Vassar, grabbed his camel-hair topcoat 
and drove out of Poughkeepsie in Vassar's 
green station 'Wagon on his way to meet 
Kingman Brewster Jr., seventeenth 
president of Yale. 

For Simpson, this was the last chance to 
salvage the Vassar-Yale affiliation, an 
arrangement that, for six months, 
colleagues and advisors bad been saying 
was doomed to fail. 

Suppose Vassar set up experimental 
undergraduate branches in New Haven to 
study special topics like Man and his 
Environment, while Vassar herself stayed 
in Poughkeepsie? Simpson needed an 
answer. 

Brewster told him the Yale Corporation 
would accept the compromise only if 
Vassar would gradually complete the 
move to New Haven. 

Simpson was not able to agree. 

Eight days later, November 20, the 
Vassar president was on the road again, 
this time driving to New York City to meet 
with his trustees. Simpson, who had never 
before been late for a trustee meeting, 
miscalculated his departure time 
from Poughkeepsie, and so was sitting in a 
traffic jam on the East Side Highway and 
not in the midtown offices of Morgan 
Guaranty Trust at 9: 30 in the morning, 
when the meeting was scheduled to begin. 

He might well have wished that be could 
stay in the traffic jam all day. 

Once he arrived at the meeting, it took 
the trustees a perfunctory thirty minutes 
to vote down Vassar's move to Yale. 

Simpson, the staunchest advocate from 
the beginning, voted no, to make the 
decision unanimous. Then he drove back 
to Poughkeepsie. There he had to read a 
trustee-written statement -
first to the 
faculty, then to student leaders, and finally 
to the entire student body. 

Vassar's decision, Simpson read each 
time, was motivated by "loyalty to a place 
as beautiful as ours, confidence in the 
future of our region, desire to be mistress 
in our own house, our commitment to 
women's education, and faith in the 
Vassar spirit of discovery of new paths of 
excellence." He also revealed general 
proposals for graduate institutes and a 
men's college. 

"Full speed ahead in Poughkeepsie," be 
concluded each time. 

When the students heard the news, half 
of them broke out in applause; some 
hissed and booed. When the faculty heard 
the news, a gruff department chairman 
who had opposed the move rose to say he 
felt "uniquely privileged to be present at 
this historical turning point." 

"You bet it's a historical turning point," 
mutttered a young teacher to a colleague. 
"Like the day the Roman Empire decided 
the Barbarians could come live on the 
near side of the Rhine."


Ellen Chesler, former managing editor of 
the Vassar Miscellany News, is a junior at 
Vassar. She has worked as a reporter for 
NBC News. Steven Weisman, 
contributing editor of The New Journal, 
is a Yale senior. He has written for 
The Wall Street Journal and The New 
York Times. Micluul Wingu, a first year 
student in the Yale Law School, has

Journal and The Chicago Daily News. 


A scant eleven months earlier, 
optimistic backers of the Vassar move had 
thought most of the problems were merely 
mechanical. But they weren't prepared for 
the aggressive resistance from the Vassar 
faculty and the Vassar alumnae, who 
proved as effective as bees at protecting 
their hive. For these two groups, the move 
was a matter, if not of life and death, at 
least of prestige and status; and certainly 
it threatened that special nostalgia one 
feels for the places of one's youth. 

The next eleven months were a period 
of proliferating committees, hardening 
attitudes, and a powerful and finally 
successful rear-guard battle by Vassar 
faculty and alumnae to preserve Vassar's 
identity- though no one could ever say 
very well what that identity was. 

But long before it was officially over, 
strangled to death by committees, the 
Vassar-Yale affiliation was threatening to 
split Vassar apart into irreconcilable 
factions. It was the seriousness of those 
splits that make it possible now to see that 
the affiliation was already a failure by the 
spring of 1967, a half-year before the final 
death throes. 


"Like Athena," Mary McCarthy has 
written, "Vassar College sprang in full 
battle-dress from the brow of a man." 

Vassar was founded in 1861 by Matthew 
Vassar, a wealthy Poughkeepsie brewer, 
to be "a college which shall be for young 
women what Yale and Harvard are to 
young men." 

Indeed, for many years Vassar was very 
nearly that. By the mid-twentieth century, 
however, graduate education had become 
an important part of American higher 
education. Vassar was not part of that 
change; like all liberal arts colleges, and 
especially women's colleges, she was 
having trouble competing for money to 
attract good teachers and good students. 

Vassar's sixth president, Sarah Gibson 
Blanding, a rugged Kentuckian whose 
retirement gift from Vassar was a tractor, 
said publicly in 1961 that ninety per cent 
of women's colleges would within 25 
years become coeducational or enlist in 
universities. 

At Yale, meanwhile, pressure for 
coeducation was building, and President 
A. Whitney Griswold sometimes 
remarked that if someone gave Yale $50 
million, he would be delighted to 
undertake the education of women. 

In 1961, Morris Hadley, a Yale trustee 
married to a Vassar trustee, suggested to 
Griswold and to Miss Blanding that the 
two schools join forces in New Haven. It 
seemed a far-fetched idea. Nonetheless, 
Miss Blanding traveled to New Haven, 
where she and Griswold, golf cap atop his 
head, wandered up and down Prospect 
Street, looking at the old houses and trees 
and wondering how the street would look 
with Vassar on it. 

They wondered enough to call a secret 
joint meeting of trustees from both 
schools in a New York women's club. But 
enthusiasm was slight, obstacles were 
clear, and the project was dropped. From 
1961 to 1966, the Vassar-Yale idea 
bloomed only in cocktail party 
conversations that were fondly recalled 
during 1967. ("So I said to him on 
Founder's Day, 'Well, why don't we move 
Vassar to New Haven?' It seemed so 
absurd at the time.")
