"When I showed these rushes to Charles, he almost cried. The film was something we had shared intimately." Eric Sherman, Yale senior, brushed his long brown hair under the ever-present safari hat. He started searching through the cluttered New York apartment he had taken five months earlier to edit his film. 

"Congress Hall in Warsaw is breathtaking," he said as he rifled through the thousands of feet of film he had shot since last June. ''The people there were so cooperative; they cleared the hall and let me set up my lights to do the shooting. When the quartet was finally on stage, I zoomed back to catch the whole auditorium as Charles began his solo." 

Sherman found the reel under his editing table. He moved all the rented equipment aside-the synchronizer, the tape cutter and the hot splicer-to set up the projector. He quickly threaded the first section and turned on the lamp. 

Charles Lloyd appears on the screen, towering over his quartet with wild, unruly hair and eyes that slope down like a sharply peaked roof when his face is in repose. He frantically races up and down several octaves, melting the beat into fluid rhythms, and adding fresh harmonies to a lyric that suggests Ravi Shankar as perhaps spoken in Nashville. 

Lloyd has a habit of performing in a Balliett shuffle, a tranced floating on the smooth runs, the slow-spinning sounds that seem to last for minutes. Pianist Keith Jarrett rocks back and forth with him, moving from expansive chords to violent one-note explosions. 

In intense moments, when Jarrett is bouncing on the piano bench like a hot seat, the pianist and drummer Jack DeJohnette exchange a sing-song responsive chant that confirms the ritualistic ballet of the whole performance. 

Ron McClure caresses his bass, his notes moving in an easy, side-stepping way around Lloyd's upper-register shrieks or bass honks. Lloyd now hits a series of tight chords, simultaneously jerking his torso, then relaxes to wind his body sensuously around a plaintive melodic aside. 

The Charles Lloyd Quartet seems held together by an extraordinary rhythmic sense. It is this feeling of movement, both in the music and the physical performance, that Eric Sherman captures in Charles Lloyd: Journey Within, a sixty-minute color film to be shown here at Yale on May 8 and 9-a film that also happens to be Sherman's senior Scholar of the House project. 

The movie really began last year when Sherman, then a Culture and Behavior major, wrote his junior paper on the sociology of jazz. He correlated physical movement and rhythm in jazz to the cultural background of the musicians, and discovered that the way in which a jazz man moves becomes a ritualistic ceremony paralleling his rhythmic orientation towards the music. 

Last spring Sherman applied to the Scholar of the House Committee to make a film on jazz that would catalogue the performances of a number of musicians and show the relationship between their visual performance and their music. It was approved, meaning that Sherman would take no courses senior year. Sherman had previously helped photograph and starred in Robert Edelstein's Sally's Hounds. He grew up breathing the air of Warner Brothers' back lots where his father, director Vincent Sherman, worked. 

This first film effort by the younger Sherman promised to be of significance to both jazz and cinema. Never before had there been a film about jazz made by a person who was competent in movie-making and who knew something about jazz. 

In March, 1967, Sherman visited Ernest Smith, the world authority on jazz in film, and was able to view Smith's collection of jazz filmography. Jam'n' the Blues, made by fashion photographer Gjon Mili in the late forties, is recognized as the most important film on jazz. But Sherman felt the film was "the coldest thing, continually working against the natural warmth of the musicians. Mili put the camera far back, and his long shots created the impersonal atmosphere that he seemed to want. He even strained to fill the set with smoke, to keep the myth going of smoke-filled back rooms as the only jazz atmosphere." 

But in making his own film, Sherman decided to combine a subjective cinematic approach and a documentary technique that would give a sense of involvement. Sherman constantly refers to the work of Robert Flaherty, a famous documentary film-maker of the late silent era. Like Flaherty, Sherman would not restrict himself to the cold "long shot-medium shot-close-up" progression of "documentary objectivity"; instead he would direct his subjects in highly stylized shot sequences. 

But Sherman was still looking for a subject. On May 5, 1967, he found him. That day he attended a concert at Town Hall in New York to hear a new quartet under the direction of Charles Lloyd. "I saw the concert and knew Charles was the one," says Sherman. "I had never seen such visual excitement, such dynamic interplay between four musicians. Their physical closeness and warmth demanded a corresponding enthusiasm from the audience, and a simpatico was established that I had never before experienced. I immediately decided that my film could only be an intensive study of this one musician." 

At that point Eric didn't know exactly how he was going to make his film. "I sensed, however, that this was the essence of film-making. I was obsessed with the desire to isolate the personal quality of the performance and put it on film. I hoped to take the theatrical atmosphere of the concert, relate that atmosphere to Charles himself-his personal creative struggle." 

Euphoric, Sherman went backstage after the concert, but Lloyd was too busy that night or the next day to talk to him. The quartet was in the midst of hysteric, last-minute preparations for their now famous Russian tour. Finally, Sherman went to Lloyd's apartment. They talked for several hours. By the time Sherman left, there was already the beginning of a unique artistic relationship and a deep and lasting friendship. 

"In one day Eric became one of the family," Lloyd recalls. "He laid his lyrics on me and I saw we were spiritually attuned. We could communicate without all the bullshit, as if he had always been with us. Like he was doing things, and running errands, and taking me to the doctor's. I mean Eric's just a beautiful and humane person. He knows I just want to sing my own song and find my audience." 

Sherman told Lloyd that he wanted to make a film about him but Lloyd joked that he had heard such promises before.
