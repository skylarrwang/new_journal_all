Lloyd went off to Russia. When he re-
turned from the Russian tour, Sherman 
was at the airport, standing in his shirt-
sleeves in the rain, filming with a Bolex 
16mm. Sherman had kept the faith, and 
Lloyd knew it. 


With the help of Marty Rubin and Peter 
Friedman, both members of the Yale Film 
Society, Sherman filmed the quartet during 
the sumer at a Rheingold Concert in 
Central Park. While Marty and Peter shot 
the audience coming in, Sherman experi-
mented with his new Eclair, a French 
camera with a powerful zoom lens, recog-
nized as the finest light-weight 16mm 
camera in the world. Sherman had no 
organized sequences planned for the 
concert footage; he was more interested 
in capturing the quartet's visual excite-
ment. He made long takes, quick cuts, and 
wide pans, as he tried to "shoot a little of 
everything." 


In reviewing the rushes, Sherman ex-
citedly discovered that the quartet's 
warmth came across. His technique was 
successful. The frames seemed to capture 
the see-saw rhythm of the whole stage 
and the harsh, brilliant quality of the 
music. Sherman also discovered that un-
natural angles or contrived shots were less 
effective than an honest, straightforward 
style. 


As the initial technical groundwork was 
established, Sherman became less arbitrary 
in his method and began to impose his own 
subjective, creative effort on the shooting. 


Later, Sherman took Charles into Cen-
tral Park alone, and tried to film what be 
was slowly seeing as a basic relationship 
between Lloyd and Nature. As Lloyd ex-
presses it, "I believe that there are natural 
rhythms in Nature, a scene where there 
can be life. I search for that place in my 
music, and it's totally insane, but as I do my 
thing there is an optimism in my music, a 
kind of wonder or love of life. I just can't 
lay alienation on anyone." 


Sherman's efforts to film this gentle, pas-
toral quality were suddenly disrupted by 
the death of leading jazz saxophonist John 
Coltrane. Lloyd went into a deep depres-
sion; he even questioned his musical 
career. He finally came out of it several 
weeks later. Then Sherman suggested that 
Lloyd take a trip to Memphis where 
Lloyd's mother and step-father still lived. 


Lloyd agreed, and Sherman packed lights, 
10,000 feet of of film, three cameras, lug-
gage, and Marty Rubin and Peter Fried-
man into a Valiant and sped off to Mem-
phis. He arrived in time to film Lloyd's 
arrival by plane, "his comin' home to pay 
his Memphis dues." 


Lloyd's mother took Sherman around 
Memphis and helped recreate her son's 
childhood. These days in Tennessee were 
essential to Sherman's conception of 
Lloyd in the film. 


"Charles' musical upbringing was like 
most Negro jazzmen's," Sherman explains. 
"He played in the usual pick-up groups in 
beer halls and back rooms. And this 
Memphis-Blues tradition is essential to his 
music. Yet the thing which characterized 
Charles, which enabled him to develop the 
European-melodic side as well as the 
rhythmic, was a lonely, often self-con-
scious, but unwavering individualism 
throughout his youth. He could never ac-
cept the nihilistic view of Negroes around 
him, bitter Tomism or vicious militancy. 
He bad this inner thing, this refusal to 
accept a label of color. He was thus able 
to approach his music more fully, and was 
strong enough to get out of Memphis and 
study on the West Coast." 


Lloyd went to Southern Cal where he 
received his master's degree in music. 
And it was at college that he met his future 
wife Joan, a tall, elegant white woman. 


Things were often difficult for Lloyd at 
USC; be remembers, "There was no com-
munication there, no expressive jazz like 
we do. You had to go round about to make 
the scene." 


Lloyd's identity as a Negro was also first 
criticized at USC. Afro-Americanism was 
not only a force in the community but 
among jazz musicians as well. Musicians 
avoid him because he wasn't "black" 
enough. But Lloyd insisted, "If they don't 
tolerate you, you have to be bigger than it. 
Music transcends the whole scene." 


"It's back to what is cause and what is 
effect," argues Sherman. "Yes, he was 
light-skinned, but he felt Negro. The im-
portant thing is that he has been con-
sistent in this drive to gain integrity. He 
never falls back on a bitter self-pity for 
being Negro. He never lapses into a black 
hang-up." 


Black or white, the young jazzman must 
struggle to transcend the terrible condi-
tions jazz musicians must accept in this 
country, an exhausting succession of short 
club dates and one-nighters. "You play in 
little jazz rooms or bars where people are 
juiced and ask you to do Melancholy 
Baby," Lloyd explains. "I played with 
Chico Hamilton and later Adderley. Play-
ing in those holes they call jazz lounges, 
guys get fed up. It's hard to keep a group 
together." 


To capture this side of jazz, traditionally 
portrayed on film, Sherman followed 
Lloyd out to the West Coast. Through his 
growing involvement with the four 
musicians, (managing them for a time, 
arranging press spots, living through a 
week of strenuous playing conditions at 
Huntington Beach), Sherman still saw 
Lloyd the individualist and Lloyd the child 
of Nature. 


Sherman saw that the four musicians 
are on the same spiritual wavelength. They 
were concerned with an inner need to 
create a valid musical statement, rather 
than a thing of racial tensions or personal 
hang-ups. They are simply a group of men 
busy taking the music apart and putting it 
back together in a realignment that will 
dictate the future of jazz. 


In Sherman's film, Keith Jarrett, the 
pianist for the quartet, says, "Artists learn 
Jaws about their art parallel to the laws of 
the universe. When I play with the group, 
I understand the Jaws." 


Each musician agrees that Nature is the 
answer, and Nature is what their music is 
about. Nature and "the journey within" 
stand as verbal signposts for the cinematic 
road Eric Sherman takes in his film. 


"I found myself using new norms, 
actually learning the Jaws of Nature," says 
Sherman. "When you look at the world 
through a viewfinder for nine months, you 
see different rhythms, what I call natural 
rhythms. I'm not a Maharishi guy, but that 
vernal, open quality is there. They said 
it was in their music, and you find that 
they're right. I found it in my film as well. 
There isn't one angle shot in the entire 
sixty minutes; I wanted to express a kind 
of order, a movement. 


"But that fluid order is difficult. And 
that's the problem with a lot of experi-
mental films. Opposition and conflict is 
easy to see and easy to express in film. 
You just move quickly. and cut furiously. 
But fluidity is much more important. 
That's why I think Renoir is the greatest
