In Comment: Girls pose number one 
problem for male Yale, Crusader 
Nader picks on the Big Guy, Bobby 
tapped by Bobby biographer, Black 
Arts get angry, and Yale screen set for 
film festival. 


The final section of a 55-page report re-
leased this week by the Student Committee 
on Teaching concludes that "co-education 
is not only the greatest overall need of the 
University-greatest in terms of Yale's 
possibilities for service to the nation or 
maintaing Yale's world prominence-but 
that it is, more precisely, Yale's most press-
ing educational necessity." 


The report, entitled "Issues of Educa-
tional Reform," also deals with such 
topics as "Free Time," "Departmental 
Structure" and "Students in Educational 
Planning." Short essays which provide 
historical background and careful analysis 
of issues are followed by numerous recom-
mendations for the reform of education 
at Yale. 

The Student Committee on Teaching, a 
branch of the Student Advisory Board, 
owes its existence to the Steering Com-
mittee Report of 1966, commonly known 
as the Dahl report, which responded to the 
furor over the denial of tenure to a popular 
young philosophy teacher in the spring of 
1965. In the past year both the Student 
Committee on Teaching and the Student 
Advisory Board have become increasingly 
emphatic in their criticism of Yale educa-
tion and the University structure--demon-
strating a serious concern on the part of 
students for integral participation in the 
affairs of the University. 

Under the general editorship of James 
L. Kugel, a senior majoring in comparative 
literature, the members of the Student 
Committee carried out extensive research 
on educational problems and then met 
weekly to discuss their findings. Out of 
this six-month work came the booklet 
which bas been widely distributed to 
various Yale faculty and student com-
mittees. Interested students and teachers 
can obtain copies of the teaching report 
from residential co!Jege deans' offices or 
the Yale College dean's office. 

The teaching report deserves careful 
attention from aiJ members of the Yale 
community, for it raises vital questions 
about the need for "increased flexibility" 
and "guided opportunity" in the organiza-
tion of Yale and its educational offerings. 

As many critics of American education 
have realized, formal education too often 
deadens the mind instead of making it 
alive to the possibilties of critical thinking 
and imagination. It is toward this goal-
the recognition of the diversity of Yale's 
students and teachers and a provision for 
their needs and interests--that the student 
report is aiming. Indeed, the quality of the 
teaching report itself argues well for the 
ability of the Yale student to take on 
greater responsibility for his own educa-
tion and a larger role in University de-
cision-making. 

The overall theme of the report is the 
"belief that all parts of college life bear 
on Yale's educational strength." As James 
Kugel reminds us in the concluding 
paragraph of the booklet, it is necessary 
to have order in the university, but one 
must be aware of that order and of its 
limits. "The University must have as much 
flexibility and as many opportunities as it 
can, so that when its order draws a line, it's 
a line, not a barrier."

Nader 

Ralph Nader spoke at the Law School 
Forum on April 10. His topic was "Legal 
Practice: Is the Old Order Crumbling?" 

"No, it isn't," says Nader, "but it should 
be." Naturally enough, Nader makes 
people nervous. The tall, intense young 
man at the rostrum was hitting his audience 
of Law School students and undergrad-
uates in some sensitive places. The boys 
heading for $15,000 with the big firms 
down on Wall Street kept quiet during the 
question period. The convinced fans, 
however, were also there with their "tell us 
more, Ralph ... "questions. 

Nader filled in the ftamework of his 
title with stories about ex-FBI men with 
Xerox copies and indelible memories 
bumping into each other in Washington 
alleys while spying on the avowed enemy 
of their corporate employers. His descrip-
tion of Harvard Law School, circa 1958, 
as a human wasteland of nervous young 
men with proto-corporate spirits brought 
much delight to the young Yale lawyers-
to-be. 

Nader has a ready wit, the kind which 
gives a touch of grace to authentically 
intense people. It is this wit, together with 
his unbridled, fact-filled, articulate de-
pictions of corporate America at work that 
makes Nader such a winning polemicist. 

His style, coupled with his analysis of the 
problems of Americans today, is devastat-
ingly effective. 

The analysis not complex. He needs no 
devil theory. American business today is 
essentially dictating a very limited role to 
the consumer. Business, unions and gov-
ernment were historically countervailing 
elements of power, each articulating the 
interests of a particular group. But today 
the Jines are blurred. Business can still 
rationalize away almost any obstacles in 
its quest for the corporate goals of manage-
ment reputation and profit. But unions and 
government today are no longer effective 
opponents or watchdogs where consumers 
and many minority groups are concerned. 

The friendliness of government and 
business is best seen in the New York-
Washington-Boston axis of large private 
law firms, whose members move easily 
back and forth between business clientele 
and government positions. The result is a 
massive pool of wealthy legal talent with 
blurred double constituencies. The con-
sumer is on the outside. 

The title of a history of American labor, 
says Nader, could be From Company 
Union to Company Union in Two Gen-
erations. The unions have, as Robert 
Kennedy used to say, "grown fat and sleek 
with power." The less fortunate are left 
behind when unemployment or disability 
prevent the continued payment of dues. 

A classic example of the easy relation-
ship of business, labor and government can 
be seen in one of Nader's current hot 
potatoes-the problem of lung disease 
among coal miners. One quarter of the 
industry's workers suffer progressive dis-
ability from prolonged exposure to coal 
dust; yet the coal companies, the United 
Mine Workers and the Bureau of Mines all 
agree that there is no such problem, at 
least as far as their responsibility extends. 

No one is legally responsible for these men 
or for preventing further disability. As 
business, govenment and labor chant to-
gether, like the robber barons, "No One 
Made Them Do the Work," these men 
have no legal voice to speak for them. 

Â·This is where Nader's "consumer in-
terest" firm has its role. 

American Indians, coal miners, people 
Jiving near natural gas and oil pipelines, 
the American motorist and on and on-
who speaks for them? Surely Betty Furness 
won't turn the tide. There should be law 
firms outside of government, funded by 
foundations and disinterested private 
sources, that can serve as a compensating 
force to the present unopposed legal cadres 
on the questions of consumer rights and the 
public interest of minorities disadvantaged 
by government, business and union prac-
tices. These firms would research, solicit 
and bring suit against corrupt and 
negligent businesses. 

Public interest law firm lawyers can 
expect low pay, low status and a very 
heavy work load. They will be under 
constant surveillance by corporate detec-
tive agencies, and so they must add the 
extra burden of an impeccable private life. 

Who would be willing to lead such a life? 
Nader answered this one directly for the 
law students. It takes one essential per-
sonal quality-:---eonviction.

Shannon 

Recently, William Shannon not only gave 
an incomprehensibly small audience in 
Morse College his incisive predictions for 
the 1968 Presidential race, but also 
speculated on the future of American 
politics with a display of far-ranging 
familiarity with the tides of American 
political history. 

Before getting down to the serious part 
of his speech, Shannon, a member of the 
New York Times editorial board, let his 
audience know that LBJ's withdrawal 
wasn't surprising for a man who "wasn't a 
paranoiac, but only a Grade-B neurotic 
like the rest of us." 

Shannon foresaw Robert Kennedy de-
feating Eugene McCarthy in Oregon and 
California (unless the Minnesota Senator 
has "a pipeline to God") and then going on 
to defeat Nixon in November. Shannon 
is the author of The Heir Apparent, a biog-
raphy of Kennedy. He cautioned, however, 
that riots this summer would boost Ken-
nedy's popularity, unless they get totally 
out of hand-which would eventually 
benefit Humphrey. 

Shannon said that he himself would 
vote for McCarthy "out of curiosity" about 
how a "real inte!Jectual," unlike Stevenson 
or John Kennedy, would handle the presi-
dency. But he did not think that the general 
public shared his curiosity. 

Shanon showed himself to be more than 
a journalistic observer with his references 
to the politics of the 1840's and the 1850's,
