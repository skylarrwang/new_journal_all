EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Three days after the assassination of Martin Luther King, President Kingman Brewster talked in Dwight Hall with students about Yale's relation to New Haven's problems. It became clear that the interests of Yale and of New Haven seldom coincide in the President's thinking. He devoted most of his remarks to rationalizing executive committees-which supposedly reconcile these divergent interests -as good politics and sound grantsmanship, and as a way to avoid raising "false expectations" in New Haven. 

However, if the recent events prompt any new involvement by Yale in New Haven, there must be less discretion and more discussion about Yale as a part of the New Haven community. 

One suspects that President Brewster has been unwilling to have a more open debate on Yale's actual and potential role in New Haven because of the limitations which he would impose on the conclusions of such a debate. 

Two days later, with a sense of urgency fitting the week, Brewster issued a memorandum committing Yale to "do more" about the city's problems and appointing yet another committee, the Yale Council on Community Affairs. The Council was appropriated $40,000. Heading it will be Tracy Barnes, an ex-CIA staff member who has been Brewster's assistant for alumni affairs since January. 

The Council has been given the task of working with "Yale's programs relating to human and neighborhood development in New Haven."lt is encouraging that this group has been empowered "to support planning and . . . to seek more adequate funds ... in the name of the University." It has the potential to meet the financial problems of many of the present programs. 

In addition, Brewster was empowered by the Yale Corporation to support, both symbolically and financially, the New Haven Black Coalition. If the new Council includes voting members from New Haven and if Yale's assistance to the Black Coalition is forthcoming, an important step may have been taken in recognizing how essential community leadership is to any Yale involvement in New Haven. 

Something positive may have been initiated, but in the area of elementary and secondary education, the memo represents only the extension of the old concept of supplementary education, not a new commitment to the New Haven schools. 

The memo alludes to a new Yale summer high school for New Haven students, which should be examined in the context of existing Yale programs. There are four which have arisen, in Brewster's words, from "free and self-determined individuals, students, faculty and staff": the present Yale Summer High School, the Transitional Year Program, Upward Bound, and the U.S. Grant Foundation. 

The programs have one common denominator; they are primarily concerned with the problems of individual students. Of the four, only the Grant Foundation works exclusively with New Haven students. Both the Summer High School and TYP are in accord with Brewster's idea of a "national constituency." Whatever their impact on the students with whom they come in contact, none of these programs has really touched the source of educational problems of their students -the public schools. While they have undoubtedly had some success with individual students, they have not helped to improve the schools to which these students return and in which other students lose interest in education. 

Moreover, three of the four programs are dealing only with high school students although even casual research will show how crucial the earlier years in school are. Studies have shown that as a bright group of inner-city students progress through public schools in New Haven, and especially after the sixth grade, their achievement levels often remain unchanged across two to three years. 

There are great needs at every level of pre-college education. Yale's programs have been essentially supplementary and peripheral to the crisis within the schools. 

The new summer high school has been justified as beneficial to the students who will be admitted. However, that rationale is applicable to any conceivable supplementary program. The school would finally extend Yale's commitment to New Haven students, but if Yale is now ready to accept more of a role in pre-college education in New Haven, a summer high school is not responsive to the most pressing needs of the community. 

Mrs. Joan Thornell of Operation Breakthrough has made this point emphatically clear to President Brewster. 

The proliferation of summer programs, regardless of the quality of their winter follow-up components, under the rhetoric of doing "better" and doing "more" (which is more appropriate to Bobby Kennedy's campaign than to an articulation of the University's commitment to urban problems) evades the main issue: Yale must help to improve the New Haven schools. Three of the most important proposals which have been made in this regard in the past have received negative action or little serious consideration: changes in the Yale M.A.T. program, an experimental school, and the Learning Center. 

First, Yale has done little to make the M.A.T. program applicable to a career in urban teaching, despite a statement by Edward Gordon, director of teacher training, that the interests of students applying to the Yale M.A.T. have changed markedly over the past several years. Now a high percentage of applicants want to teach in inner-city schools, and many come into the program with tutoring experience. 

A number of recent M.A.T. graduates currently teaching at Lee High School have voiced numerous criticisms of the program and concluded that "Yale has the program but has not quite decided whether it has the commitment" and that the M.A.T. is "the bastard child whose existence cannot be denied, but whose presence is ignored." 

A number of changes should be made in the M.A.T. It is now a basically suburb-oriented program despite a new component at Lee High School, and it must be made more relevant to urban teaching. It suffers by having to fulfill both Connecticut teaching requirements and Yale master's requirements, and Yale should work to liberalize both. Radical changes in the actual training of teachers need to be undertaken, and the experience of the Yale Psycho-Educational Clinic in the public schools would provide invaluable insights for restructuring the program. 

Yale perpetuates the illusion that instruction in subject matter is central to teacher training. More emphasis must be placed on in-school experience with careful observation, which is not now available, and subsequent discussion in groups of experienced and new teachers. 

Yale must assume a less condescending attitude toward the public schools and use the resources of the creative teachers in New Haven. A background of teaching experience and competence in education, not in an academic discipline, should be the primary requirement for the faculty in the teacher training program. 

In addition, instructors who are not full-time faculty members should be welcomed with the knowledge that current experiences are vitally important to the M.A.T. student. Many of the above suggestions could infuse new ideas and methods into the New Haven schools. 

Moreover, follow-up seminars for M.A.T. students, recent graduates who are teaching in New Haven, and experienced teachers might be organized. 

However, the University shows no sign of changing and expanding M.A.T. along any of these lines. In May of last year, Professor Claude Buxton, appointed chairman of the Executive Committee on Elementary and Secondary Education in 1965, wrote a letter to University Provost Charles Taylor advocating the continuation of the M.A.T., apparently with no significant modifications, for five years as a "symbolic" indication of Yale's interest in education. 

Second, the idea of an experimental school, with significant community involvement, could have been an important first step for Yale into New Haven. Two years ago, Professor William Kessen circulated to the New Haven Board of Education and to some members of the Yale faculty a proposal for an experimental school (not a demonstration school for some particular idea in education) which would have been under the joint administration of Yale and New Haven. Successful innovations in the school could be transplanted into other parts of the school system. Apparently, funds were available for the school from the Carnegie Foundation. 

However, the proposal was abandoned by the Yale administration when the New Haven school superintendent was changed and because of a feeling that such a school would not be an appropriate first joint undertaking between Yale and New Haven -rather one which might strain town-gown relations. Moreover, there were the competing interests of a joint undertaking by the New Haven and Hamden Boards of Education on the old Quinnipiac campus. 

Instead of other action, Yale took no action, and in this vacuum a group of Harvard graduates proposed to establish an experimental school in New Haven. The New Haven Board of Education has not acted favorably on this proposal, partially in deference to Yale. An experimental school composed of a representative group of New Haven students- not Yale faculty children-still merits serious consideration as a means for Yale's becoming involved in pre-college education in New Haven. 


Third, an idea similar to an experimental school, under the rubric of the Learning Center, has been proposed to the Yale administration by Lawrence Paros, director of the Yale Summer High School, Robert Gelbach of the Upward Bound Program and Torrey Orton, a local school teacher. No action has yet been taken on the proposal, but it has received favorable response from numerous individuals in the University. Should this proposal garner the support of the community, perhaps through the Black Coalition, it would warrant immediate implementation. 

The Learning Center would accept students who have demonstrated failure or under-achievement in the public schools. They would study six core areas in curriculum (English, mathematics, social studies, science, fine arts, and foreign languages), and schedules would be individually arranged to permit a student more concentration in the area of his interest. Students would study in a workshop, not a classroom setting, both individually and on collaborative projects. Teachers and associates would develop different teaching styles, but they would generally be available for problem solving and frequent evaluation of students' efforts. 

In brief, the Learning Center would attempt to confront creatively the problems of adolescent education with new curricula and a restructuring of the school experience. The Learning Center could complement the present teacher training program at Yale and would be an excellent facility for in-school experience for M.A.T. students if the M.A.T. is reoriented. Also very important, the Learning Center might be used to train black teachers, who are desperately needed in New Haven and elsewhere. 

Instead of changing the M.A.T., undertaking an experimental school or adopting the Learning Center proposal, any of which would have an impact on the New Haven schools, the University has been contemplating the establishment of a Center for Studies of Education within the new Institute for Social Science. Professor Buxton, reporting for his committee, submitted a report on such a center to President Brewster on February 4, 1968. While that report has been rewritten and resubmitted and is not available at this time, any basic changes over the first report would be a real surprise. 

The Center for Studies of Education is proposed Instead of re-establishment of the department of education at Yale, which was abolished in 1958 by President Griswold largely because the field of education was thought to be insubstantial by comparison with the research and scholarship of other departments. This attitude prevails, and the Center would be problem-oriented, drawing on the resources of the social science departments. 

Thus the Center would be founded on the mistaken assumption that present department standards for hiring faculty have some bearing on a person's value in the field of education. Unless provision is made to bring to Yale's proposed Center for Studies of Education some of the brightest people in elementary and secondary education, who would probably neither deserve nor desire tenure at Yale, the University will prolong its irrelevance to the New Haven schools. It is only the most exceptional faculty members at Yale who can meet department standards and still have something to contribute to pre-college education. In addition to the reservations already mentioned about the Center for Studies of Education, it should be noted that little thought has been given to relating this Center to the New Haven schools. 

At this juncture, a very important point must be recognized. Yale is not now a great reservoir of resources in public education whose flood gates might be opened to New Haven. In only a few instances, such as the Psycho-Educational Clinic, has the University generated through involvement in New Haven any knowledge which bears on the practical problems daily confronting teachers and students in the public schools. Moreover, a detached Yale cannot assume that it knows either what is needed in the schools or what is desired by the community. Standards which the University would apply and its preconceptions of effectiveness may be irrelevant. Yale should not patronizingly expect gratitude from New Haven as efforts are made to relate the University to the community's problems. 

We must recognize that Yale has much to learn if it is ever to have much to offer New Haven. A good first step would be the Learning Center proposal. There are other possibilities, undoubtedly, but we must keep in mind that the examination of Yale's role in education in New Haven has been conducted for almost three years by committee and without any indication that Yale may become fruitfully involved in the schools. 

Most important, Yale must act in response to the community's needs and not according to preconceptions of the correct concerns for a university with a liberal arts tradition. Yale students and faculty need a demonstration of creative leadership by President Brewster. The University must establish a new type of involvement in New Haven. The institution of a new summer high school would not be a sign of that leadership. 

Yale has no history of institutional commitment to improving elementary and secondary education in New Haven. In fact, the time has come to state simply and emphatically that Yale's concern with New Haven has been minimal. Only after this admission will Yale shed its three-piece tactfulness, making itself fully vulnerable to criticism and thereby open to new possibilities. 

Yale must find a new sense of responsibility grounded in the shameful realities of how Yale's inaction has contributed to poor education for New Haven's children. Moreover, if Yale is to become helpful in the educational crisis of the urban schools of this country, it must begin by demonstrating an ability to relate to the problems of this community of which it is a part. 

As black and white America have developed along separate and unequal paths, so also Yale and New Haven. And the racial implications will become dramatically clear if Yale does not break with its history in pre-college education for New Haven, admitting past failures and becoming more involved.
