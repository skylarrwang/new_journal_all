Alan Simpson thought the move to New 
Haven would offer Vassar a way out of its 
crisis. He miscalculated. 

Kingman Brewster climbs into a Yale plane 
to fly to Poughkeepsie. Meetings were 
scrupulously alternated between Pough-
keepsie and New Haven. But it didn't do 
any good. 

Alan Simpson arrived at Vassar in 1964 
from Chicago. Witty and urbane, Simpson 
at 55 speaks with an English accent 22 
years after leaving England. He's a wry 
man who once told a startled alumnae 
group, "When Vassar women are middle-
aged they should have something better to 
do than play bridge and fornicate." A 
respected historian, Simpson had been an 
effective dean at the University of 
Chicago, but he came to Vassar tired of 
universities and their emphasis on 
professional scholarship. "He'd had it with 
Chicago," a friend remembers. 

His inaugural address at Vassar, which 
haunted him throughout the Vassar-Yale 
affair, celebrated the virtues of a four-year 
liberal education away from scholarly 
professionalism. He praised women's 
education and revealed that he had read 
widely on the subject of women and had 
even made a trip to Russia to see what 
kind of life women lead there. 

But his first years at Vassar were in 
some ways disillusioning. Four years after 
the inaugural was given, Simpson refused 
to release it for a book of essays, saying 
that he had changed his mind. 

"After Alan had been here for a while, 
he became aware of a tremendous laxity 
at Vassar," one of his associates said 
recently. "He saw- like some of the rest 
of us -
that we were mostly very dull." 

Indeed, Vassar had sat in her corner, 
while the other Seven Sisters were busy 
creating ties with nearby colleges. This 
isolation helps explain why she ranks near 
the bottom of the Seven Sisters on both 
college board scores and number of 
applicants. Kingman Brewster said, 
shortly after the Vassar-Yale Study was 
announced, "Of all the first-rate women's 
colleges, Vassar is one of the few that does 
not have a natural dancing partner in its 
own neighborhood." 

More than this, Simpson found 
relatively little concern at Vassar over the 
college's future. Many young faculty 
members didn't care much because they 
often moved on after two or three years. 
And many older Vassar professors, some 
of them alumnae, were simply accustomed 
to and liked the Vassar they knew. 

But if Simpson's views on the relevance 
of Vassar's liberal education changed, his 
view of Vassar women did not. According 
to one associate, he continued to think of 
Vassar alumnae as women like Mary 
McCarthy- the independent, spirited 
writer who graduated from Vassar in 
193 3. Simpson was never quite able to 
reconcile this image with the near-
hysterical reaction of many Vassar 
alumnae to the Yale proposal. 

Simpson bad further problems. He was 
a more forceful president than his 
predecessors, more forceful than many 
older professors thought he had any right 
to be. 

There were some, however, who shared 
Simpson's concerns over Vassar's future. 
In the spring of 1966, trustee board 
president John Wilkie, who is president of 
the Central Hudson Gas and Electric 
Company, sent the other trustees a memo 
filled with questions about what 
sort of future the college should 
have. And in late October, 1966, 
the board set up a New Dimensions 
Committee to consider I 3 specific ideas, 
including coeducation, a four-year M.A. 
program and cooperation with other 
schools. The committee included six 
professors, five trustees, four deans and 
two non-voting students. But the New 
Dimensions Committee organized itself 
slowly; and so in December, 1966, an 
affiliation with Yale finally seemed to offer 
Vassar a way out of her lethargy and 
depression. 

At Yale the first official statement about 
coeducation after the secret Blanding-
Griswold stroll came in the Freshman 
Year Report of 1963. "We think Yale has 
a national duty, as well as a duty to itself, 
to provide the rigorous training for 
women that we supply for men," the 
report said. 

Kingman Brewster Jr. became president 
of Yale in 1964, the same year Simpson 
came to Vassar. In his first years he did 
little more for the Yale-Vassar dream 
than repeat Griswold's private promise to 
act if someone kicked in the money. But 
in early 1966, Brewster told Lanny J. 
Davis, scrappy Yale Daily News 
chairman, that he wanted the Yale 
Corporation to state officially the 
University's interest in educating women. 
In March of that year, Brewster got his 
statement. It didn't say much, except that 
Yale preferred a coordinate college to 
women in Yale College itself. But that 
was more than Yale had ever said before. 

During that spring, the News began its 
coeducation forum, edited by Frederick I. 
Taft, whose mother, Frances Taft, became 
president of the Vassar Alumnae in 1966 
and an eventual opponent of a Vassar 
move. The forum included statements on 
coeducation, mostly in favor of it, from 
about 20 educators. The readers agreed: 
a News poll found that eighty per cent of 
the undergraduates and even more of the 
faculty wanted coeducation. 

That fall, Brewster announced that Yale 
had received an anonymous grant to 
support something called "a special study 
into the needs of potential improvements 
in undergraduate education for women in 
America." Edna Rostow, wife of the 
former dean of the Yale Law School, 
Eugene Rostow, was named to head the 
study. Unfortunately for the study, if not 
for the nation, Eugene was summoned to 
Washington one week later to aid his 
brother Walt in the struggle for freedom 
in Asia, and Yale said goodbye to Edna. 
No replacement was announced. 

Then came the man whom Sam 
Chauncey, Brewster's assistant, calls 
Mr. X. This Mr. X fixed Brewster and 
Simpson up for a date to discuss 
affiliation. Although neither will identify 
the matchmaker, bets are on Julius 
Stratton, a member of Vassar's board of 
trustees and a good friend of Brewster's 
since the days when Brewster was a 
Harvard law professor and Stratton the 
president of MIT. Stratton, now chairman 
of the Ford Foundation, will neither 
confirm nor deny the rumor. 

Simpson, Brewster and Mr. X dined 
together on December 4, 1966, in New 
York- on neutral ground. (Later 
meetings were also held in New York or 
were scrupulously alternated between the 
two schools.) 

Three days later, Simpson road-tripped 
to New Haven, where he toured the Yale 
campus, finally agreeing with Brewster to 
present the idea to the respective boards 
of trustees. At Vassar, on December 14, 
the entire board met to approve the 
proposal. Simpson called it "daunting and 
dazzling." 

That night Simpson called Brewster,


S I The New Journal! April28, 1968 
who spoke from a telephone in the 
kitchen at Trumbull College, where he 
had been meeting with students. Simpson 
said his board had accepted the invitation 
that Brewster was now supposed to 
extract from his Corporation. "It's up to 
you now," said Simpson. Brewster had 
taken no chances; he had already 
contacted most of his board and, at New 
York's Commonwealth Club two days 
later, the Yale Corporation approved the 
study. 

Only 12 days passed from the first 
Brewster-Simpson tete-a-tete to the final 
Yale approval. The presidents had hurried 
to prevent news from leaking out before 
everyone had formally agreed. Simpson 
feared a leak might lead to rumors among 
sensitive alumnae and faculty that the 
proposal was more than a proposal. 

But there was a leak anyway. The best 
sources indicate that Yale trustee John 
Hay Whitney accidentally mentioned the 
news at a Washington cocktail party 
where reporters overheard it. The leak 
could also have resulted from the fuss 
surrounding Mayor John Lindsay's 
interruption of his morning schedule to 
attend a special meeting of the Yale 
Corporation. 

As Washington Post reporters began 
phoning contacts at Vassar, the Vassar 
administration realized the story was out 
and advanced Simpson's announcement 
to the faculty to the next morning. Letters 
went out immediately, telling faculty to 
gather at ten on Saturday. 

What followed was a comedy of errors. 
The emergency faculty meeting tipped 
off the New York Times Vassar 
correspondent, who called New York to 
tell Fred Hechinger, the Times education 
editor, that something was up. When 
Steve Kezerian, head of the Yale News 
Bureau, called Hechinger later in the day 
to alert him to a major announcement for 
Monday, Hechinger jumped the gun and 
guessed it had to do with Vassar. 

Kezerian confirmed the guess and filled 
Hechinger in on the details. 

With the details he got from Kezerian 
and a reporter he had dispatched to 
Vassar, Hechinger wrote his story. At a 
dinner party later in the evening, he 
decided to call Simpson, a personal friend, 
to tell him the story would have to be 
moved up to the next morning's paper. A 
surprised Simpson first pleaded with 
Hechinger to hold the story at least until 
Sunday. Simpson was in a precarious 
position with alumnae and faculty, who 
would have wanted to hear about the 
proposal first from Vassar, not The New 
York Times. When Hechinger explained 
why he couldn't hold the story, Simpson 
gave him more details. After phoning the 
material into The Times, Hechinger went 
back to dinner. But before he could begin, 
Brewster called him with more 
information from Yale. Hechinger called 
the latest news into his office and went 
back to his soup, which was now cold. 

Back in Poughkeepsie, Alan Simpson 
never finished his soup. He spent the rest 
of his evening hurriedly calling important 
Vassar people, trying to cushion the shock 
the morning's papers would bring. But he 
couldn't call all 20,000 alumnae or all 200 
faculty members at Vassar. 

The Friday evening before Simpson's 
announcement, a group of Vassar junior 
faculty members were having cocktails at 
an apartment on 'Raymond A venue. They 
wondered why they had suddenly been 
told to come to an emergency meeting the 
next morning. 

"Maybe Vassar's moving to Yale," one 
teacher joked. 

Everyone laughed. 

The news of the Vassar-Yale study caught 
everyone by surprise. In Poughkeepsie, 
hundreds of girls in Shetlands and 
dungarees interrupted late morning coffee 
to assemble outside the Main Building 
cheering for Alan Simpson, their 
president, and singing choruses of "Boola 
Boola" and the Whiffenpoof Song. At one 
o'clock, somebody rang the ceremonial 
bell in the tower atop Main, and Simpson 
stood on a balcony, framed by banners: 
"Beat Harvard" and "Wisdom and Men" 
(from the school motto, "Wisdom and 
Purity"). Simpson grinned as he tried to 
cool down the frenzy. "No one is going 
anywhere yet," he said paternally as the 
girls hissed. A headline in Monday's 
Vassar Miscellany News giggled: "For 
God, for Country, for Yale and Vassar." 

In Manhattan that Saturday morning, 
a senior editor of Life named Dorothy 
Seiberling, Vassar '43, stared at her New 
York Times and wept. And in New 
Haven, a young auburn-haired French 
instructor named Eve Katz, Radcliffe '59, 
saw the huge New Haven Journal-Courier 
headlines and thought it was good news. 
They would never undertake a study like 
this unless the move were definitely going 
to take place, she thought. From 
Cleveland, Frances P. Taft, director of 
the Vassar Associate Alumnae, told a 
student reporter, "It couldn't have 
happened to two nicer schools." In Paris, 
Mary McCarthy said, "They deserve each 
other." 

The city of Poughkeepsie registered 
horrified disapproval. Mayor Richard 
Mitchell proposed an immediate study of 
the possibility of Yale's moving to 
Poughkeepsie. Suddenly, local people 
realized how much Vassar's presence adds 
to the cultural fabric of Poughkeepsie and 
Dutchess County, plus the estimated six 
million dollars the college annually adds 
to the local economy. Thus a local 
newspaper declared that residents could 
"no longer take Vassar for granted. We 
cherish the college, we will do anything in 
our power to keep it here." 

Local legislators dutifully introduced a 
spate of bills which would keep Vassar in 
New York. Vassar officials tended to 
discount some of the proposals as 
gestures. Meanwhile, some local 
merchants argued in the newspapers. One 
said ninety percent of his business was 
with Vassar; another retorted: "I'd be 
glad to see Vassar girls' checks go 
bouncing elsewhere." 

In New Haven, Yale people took the 
proposal in stride. Brewster didn't speak 
to his faculty until January. Students 
spoke eagerly, but there were no rallies. 
And when everyone returned from winter 
vacation in January, the Yale Daily News 
ran stories for four days and stopped. 
"People are getting tired of it," said 
Managing Editor John Brim, and they 
were. They took it for granted that Vassar 
would move, but that nothing would 
happen while they were still at Yale. 

In Poughkeepsie, Alao Simpson was 
beginning to suffer from the confusion

These are trees. Not just any trees. These are 
Vassar trees and Vassar trees are one big 
reason that Vassar didn't move to Yale. 

surrounding the original hasty 
announcement. The very assumptions that 
the Vassar-Yale Study would work from 
remained unclear. 

What was the study studying? 

According to the first official statement, 
the investigation would cover both the 
desirability and the feasibility of moving 
Vassar to Ne-w: Haven. But Brewster 
explained things differently at a Yale 
faculty meeting in January. The minutes 
of the meeting read: "Implicit in the study 
is the assumption that if union appears 
feasible both Vassar and Yale would favor 
such an occurrence." At Yale, one could 
say desirability was taken for granted: at 
Vassar-well, it all depended. Sometimes 
Simpson did seem to take it for granted, 
as when he told student leaders, "Vassar 
needs Yale," and called the Yale project 
"this happy fruition." But Simpson 
discovered quickly that with his partly 
suspicious and partly hostile faculty he 
should stick to the idea of the original 
announcement, that the study was to 
determine both desirability and feasibility. 

Brewster recognized these 
contradictions but dismissed them in an 
interview as "merely a reflection of a 
difference in political climate." What 
Brewster didn't see was how the ambiguity 
would anger the Vassar faculty, making 
Simpson's job even more troublesome. 

Simpson was in a difficult position: he 
had to play both leading advocate and 
objective judge, and he couldn't play both 
roles to very ma.ny people's satisfaction. 

Simpson blundered early in making his 
appointments to the Study Committee 
Staff. The key members were new to 
Vassar, and the faculty resented that. 
Vice-President James Ritterskamp was in 
his first year in Poughkeepsie; George 
Langdon, presidential assistant, was in his 
third year; and Dean of the Faculty Nell 
Eurich was well into her third week. Mrs. 
Eurich headed the academic side of <the 
study for Vassar. 

A hummingbird of a woman, Nell 
Eurich had over twenty years of 
experience in academic administration, 
most recently as a dean at New College in 
Sarasota, Florida. But her scholarly 
achievements were sparse. She turned 
out to be the big surprise among 
Simpson's appointees, for she reportedly 
became the only Staff member to oppose 
the move. But faculty opponents did not 
at first realize that Nell Eurich might be 
on their side; they regarded her and all the 
others as advocates of the move rather 
than impartial investigators. 

Simpson made a bigger blunder when 
he circumvented the spirit, if not the fact, 
of the Governance, the Vassar faculty's 
bill of rights, by appointing his own 
committee to advise the Staff about 
faculty opinion. Because the Governance 
declares that the faculty has final say over 
"educational policy," committees are the 
way of life at Vassar. There's an old 
saying that if the Second Coming were 
announced for tomorrow, Vassar would 
elect a committee to look into the matter. 
There's even a committee to oversee the 
committees. 

Although Simpson's Appointed 
Committee was weighted with 
distinguished professors, the Vassar 
faculty objected. It wanted to elect its own 
committee. Within a week after Simpson 
announced his appointments, protests 
were voiced, and ballots were distributed 
through the mail; and within another 
week, the faculty had its own Elected 
Committee, composed mostly of people 
opposed to the move. For the rest of the 
year, the two committees competed for 
Nell Eurich's Wednesday afternoons, 
when she would carefully spend an hour 
with one and then an hour with the other. 
The Elected Committee also met regularly 
with Elizabeth Daniels, the dean of 
studies who was in her turn chairman of 
the New Dimensions Committee. 

Simpson was stung by the creation of 
the Elected Committee as well as by 
general criticisms of his Appointed 
Committee. He had not expected faculty 
obstruction to come so quickly and with 
such force. He bad anticipated that his 
senior faculty would be reluctant to move 
late in their careers from pastoral 
Poughkeepsie, with its college-provided 
housing, to the insecurity of rented 
apartments under a layer of New Haven's 
industrial soot. But he had underestimated 
how much the faculty would fear being 
"second-class citizens" at Yale, without 
the right to teach in the graduate school. 

Simpson wanted the Yale proposal to 
be studied independently of an emotional 
public debate. He kept telling his 
professors that they would have their "day 
in court," but many refused to trust him. 
They saw only a Brewster-Simpson 
conspiracy. 

Also contributing to their resistance 
was a statement in January by former 
Vassar President Henry Noble 
McCracken, author of two books on the 
history of Dutchess County, who still had 
influence with older faculty members and 
alumnae. He said "big money" was behind 
the Vassar-Yale Study. The 87-year-old 
McCracken, president from 1915 to 1946, 
didn't hide his opposition. 

Simpson's first series of setbacks made 
it clear the proposal was in trouble. By 
March, over six months before the first 
rejection, one member of the Staff, Clyde 
Griffen, was saying that his personal count 
showed overwhelming faculty opposition 
to the Vassar move. "They're against it," 
he would say unhappily, as he counted 
names of important Vassar teachers on 
his fingers. "My guess is that the faculty is 
against the idea by sixty per cent." 

Vassar's twenty thousand graduates also 
caused Simpson headaches. He spent the 
spring racing around the country 
lecturing to alumnae meetings, but his 
reception was unenthusiastic. The 
following summer, one alumna, on a tour 
around the world, stepped into a Buddhist 
shrine and prayed that Alan Simpson be 
struck down. 

After an initial letter in December to 
. about 200 alumnae officials, Simpson 
tried to get his message across in a 
February Alumnae Magazine letter which 
asked: "Which of us could resist the 
excitement of building Vassar College a 
new home?" Apparently almost everyone 
could; it seemed that only the opponents 
were willing to beat any drums. Simpson 
responded to the sniping by defending the 
idea of a move to Yale. But he only made 
matters worse as he convinced people 
that, just as they suspected, the trustees 
were already certain of the move's 
desirability. 

For Simpson the alumnae response was 
a bitter blow. He didn't understand it-
it was not what he had expected from 
Mary McCarthy's classmates- and in. 
March he returned from a California tnp 
and chastised his critics. "For any alumna 
to organize opposition to this study before
