it has come to any conclusions," Simpson 
said, "is a betrayal of the essence of a 
Vassar education." It was like Dean Rusk 
trying to hold off the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. Within a month, 
a group called Alumnae for Vassar's 
Future organized anyway, headed by Life 
editor Dorothy Seiberling, and took a 
full-page insertion in the Alumnae 
Magazine. The ad asked in big, bold 
letters, "Is This Trip Necessary?" and 
then explained why it wasn't, even quoting 
from a Yale Daily News editorial which 
accused Yale of "shortchanging" its 
undergraduates. The advertisement 
concluded with a one-word plea: "Write." 
The alumnae did write. Their magazine 
printed 62 letters as the study 
progressed -
most of them opposed. 

Vassar Trustee Chairman John Wilkie 
was receiving a dozen letters a day for a 
while, and still more cascaded into the 
offices of Simpson and other trustees, most 
of them also opposed. 

A popular vehicle for expressing 
alumnae dissent was tree imagery. One 
1929 graduate compared Vassar to a 
"magnificent oak," adding that if an oak 
no longer has room to grow, it becomes 
good only for lumber. "But boards," 
reasoned the alumna, "can never engender 
the same respect and reverence as the tree 
from which they came." On the other 
hand, she continued, "should Vassar be 
moved ... she will become a vine, 
dependent on another institution .... Or, 
if not a vine, she will become a grafted or 
budded plant with roots not her own." 
The letter concluded with the hope that 
Vassar be allowed to develop "as a tree, 
not as a vine or grafted plant." Most of 
the other alumnae opposing the move also 
expressed a concern for Vassar's identity. 

A long and thoughtful letter from 
Katharine Biddle More, 1953, examined 
undergraduate life at Vassar and offered 
a summary of it from her grandfather: 
"It was," he said, "the best preparation for 
marriage because nothing afterwards 
could possibly be as bad." To arguments 
that Vassar shouldn't abandon its 
beautiful campus, the letter replied: "The 
proper study of late adolescence is Man, 
not trees." 

Simpson confronted the alumnae 
en masse on April 12. From 75 
Vassar Clubs across the country and 
around the world, and from every Vassar 
class from 1 899 to 1966, 250 
representatives assembled for the biannual 
meeting of the Alumnae Council. 

The first night of the three-day 
gathering, the ladies met at Alumnae 
House. Alumnae House is perched on a 
small hill overlooking the Vassar campus, 
and it belongs to the Associate Alumnae, 
one of two autonomous alumni groups in 
the country. 

A rambling, three-story building, 
Alumnae House used to be filled with 
women who returned to Vassar for 
vacations or for the lavish parties thrown 
by Alumnae Secretary Gertrude Garnsey, 
1926. Times have changed. Today the 
alumnae go elsewhere, Gert Garnsey is 
old, and the building is usually filled 
with the overnight male guests of the 
students- but Alumnae House is still the 
alumnae's, and many of them remember. 

What Alan Simpson spoke about that 
evening seemed far away from the Vassar 
they remembered. Greeted initially with 
polite applause, Simpson declared that 
.. Vassar College cannot go it alone-
cannot go it alone." He asked if separate 
education for women had not "outlived 
its historic justification." He said, "You 
can stay in Poughkeepsie and find yourself 
the victim of a silent move, one not so 
dramatic, a move away from excellence." 
The applause when Simpson sat down was 
perfunctory. 

Nell Eurich followed with a rambling 
discussion of the Vassar-Yale study; 
bubbling, a hummingbird, she left the 
alumnae unimpressed. 

But the alumnae waited, and when 
Elizabeth Daniels spoke, they heard what 
most of them wanted to hear. Mrs. 
Daniels of the New Dimensions 
Committee had found new dimensions. 
Wearing an Arnel psychedelic print dress, 
she announced that even as the Vassar-
Yale study was continuing, alternatives 
were being explored. Perhaps a Matthew 
College, for men -
in Poughkeepsie. 

Laughter and applause. Perhaps an 
Institute for Man and His Environment, 
or for public administration, or for 
computer research -
all in Poughkeepsie. 

Tumultuous applause. 

Throughout the year the woman in the 
center of the alumnae maelstrom was 
Frances Prindle Taft, 1942, a sandy-
haired tennis champion who is president 
of the Associate Alumnae. Mrs. Taft's 
opposition to the move crystallized in the 
spring, but she was to experience defeat as 
well as a victory that November. Her 
husband Seth ran unsuccessfully against 
Carl Stokes for mayor of Cleveland. 

Mrs. Taft had grown up in New Haven 
and remembered Yale as large and 
impersonal. Although her husband and son 
went to Yale (she had, in fact, sold 
sandwiches while at Vassar to finance 
visits to Seth in New Haven), she still 
distrusted that sort of education; she 
thought coeducation was fine for 
secondary schools, but not for colleges. 
College for Mrs. Taft in 1967 was still the 
same sort of retreat Alan Simpson had 
celebrated in his inaugural address. "If I 
had a million dollars," she once said, "I'd 
give it to Vassar." 

Mrs. Taft was on the receiving end of 
what she called "League of Women Voter 
tactics- the only tactics the alumnae 
knew." The alumnae seemed to her to be 
"excited about having a cause"; she 
had to hire one of her husband's old 
secretaries for one night a week to answer 
letters. Her own opposition to the Yale 
move (as a zoology major, she said, she 
had learned you can't graft a leg from one 
animal on to another) was underscored 
by her feeling that Simpson was not giving 
the alumnae a fair evaluation of the 
proposal. By mid-spring, she didn't trust 
Simpson, and told other alumnae so at 
the April meeting. 

After that meeting, Simpson had one 
more mishap with the faculty. He had 
scheduled a Liberal Ans Symposium for 
May 5, and one of four featured speakers 
was supposed to be Duke University 
President Douglas M. Knight, a Yale 
Ph.D. Knight, who had gone to Duke from 
Lawrence College in Wisconsin, was 
expected to tell how rewarding it was to 
transfer from a small school to a big one. 
But Knight was ill, so the faculty listened 
instead to a lopsided series of accounts 
about the virtues of separate education 
and the isolated liberal arts college -
from the presidents of Sarah Lawrence 
and Swarthmore respectively. The 
evening's discussion, planned by Simpson, 
ended up lauding just the characteristics 
of Vassar he believed to be its major 
problems.
