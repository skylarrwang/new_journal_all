19 I The New Journal ! April28, 1968 
The closest I came to understanding 
this embarrassment was when I talked 
with.a 60-year-old peasant who had been a 
longtime supporter of the VietCong but 
who was now in a government hamlet by 
choice. 

"How do the Viet Cong politics 
compare with the GVN politics?" 
"VietCong politics are much better," 
he said, "they really know how to talk to 
peasants like me and what to say. The 
government says many things, but it is 
often only talk." 

"How does the behavior of the VC 
compare with the behavior of the 
government?" 
"VC behavior is better. They are always 
polite, always helpful. The village soldiers 
are now polite, but not so helpful. The 
ARVN soldiers behave badly." 

"WeU, how does life under the VC 
compare with life under the government?" 
"I can't live under the VietCong any 
more," he said. "Too many speeches and 
too many meetings. All we ever did was 
talk about the struggle." 

That's what the myth of the village 
means to me. Peasants who have no 
material rewards are assumed to have 
spiritual rewards; when a son sticks to his 
father for survival, it's called filial piety, 
and when one village doesn't talk to the 
neighboring village, it's called solidarity. 
Economic welfare and modernization 
are good, but somehow they don't 
magicaly bring dignity, pride and self-
respect to peasants, and they don't help 
knit a society together. We are trying to do 
in Vietnam what we can't do in our own 
ghettoes.

Comment 
continued from page 2 
when party structure changed and the 
Free Soil Party's founding resulted from 
party disagreement over slavery. He felt 
that there would be a definite party re-
alignment by 1972 if Nixon did lose to 
Kennedy and that the age of Lindsay 
Republicanism would be over. There 
would appear on the scene, he predicted, a 
third party of definite power, while the 
Republicans and Democrats would drift 
to the extremes of the political spectrum.

**Title: Yale College Festival**
**Author: Paul Bennett**

Festival 
Two years ago the study of film at Yale 
was an experiment, a side-track of the 
academic treatment of the arts regarded 
with mild condescension and not a little 
suspicion of dilettantism. Students in 
Standish Lawder's Directed Studies sem-
inar on the history of the cinema grew 
accustomed to raised eyebrows and quiz-
zical looks when they spoke of their work. 
The transfer of Lawder's course to the 
standard history of art curriculum and the 
opening of an undergraduate course in 
filmmaking were major steps forward into 
this peculiarly neglected field, and the 
acquistion of the Griggs film collection 
bas increased the history of art depart-
lllent's film library from three or four 
titles to more than two hundred. 

This year will close with what might 
tum out to be the most important innova-
tion of all, the Yale Film Festival, which 
"ill open on May 10. By April 15, five days 
before the deadline, invitations to 450 
independent filmmakers had brought in 
lllore than fifty entries. In addition, a 
twelve-hour package of films from the 
Ann Arbor Film Festival will be con-
sidered. Approximately nine hours of 
this mass of film will be selected to be 
shown in three public screenings in the 
Law School auditorium, May 10, 11 and 
12. Since aU the entries must be less than 
thirty minutes long, each screening should 
be a richly varied experience. 

"We're looking for sensitive, experi-
mental, independent filmmakers doing the 
sort of original, creative work that just isn't 
seen very often," says Lawder. 

To encourage these filmmakers to par-
ticipate, the Festival will award $1000 in 
prizes, donated by the pioneer of the 
early avant-garde film movement, Hans 
Richter. There is an echo of Richter's 
taste for intense cinema in the special prize 
to be awarded for the best film of less than 
three minutes. 

The film jury includes representatives 
of various approaches to filmmaking. 
Willard van Dyke, Director of the Depart-
ment of Film at the Museum of Modern 
Art, has accepted, along with the high 
priest of the underground film movement, 
Jonas Mekas. Warren Beatty is expected 
as the third judge, and Renata Adler, film 
critic for the New York Times, will attend. 

The Film Festival is one answer to the 
delicate problem of the University's ap-
proach to the arts and particularly to the 
working artist. Yale has just begun to ap-
proach film as an area of study, and treat-
ment of it is spread through several 
departments. While the problems of teach-
ing history of film and filmmaking are still 
being worked out, the Festival is con-
tributing to all aspects of film study at 
Yale by bringing in the best of the over-
whelming number of innovative films 
being turned out in relative obscurity all 
over the country.
