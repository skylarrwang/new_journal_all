wheeling a sack of Blue Seal horse feed from
Zephyr's stall to Oreo's. "Polo is an incred-
ibly expensive sport. I certainly don't have
the money to play anywhere other than
Yale." One thing that might surprise you
about equestrian sports at Yale
besides the
fact that it exists
is that they have had an
unpretentious history.

The stables owe their existence to the
Army.
In 1916, the War Department
approved an ROTC training division at
Yale. This impetus drove interested alumni
to contribute money toward the construc-
tion of an equestrian center, according to
Alexandra Redding '02, a veteran of the
Polo Team. After the completion of the
Armory, as the facility was called, the Army
provided horses and equipment, so that a
polo team could be maintained at "practi-
cally no expense to the student," wrote one
contemporary.
Similar ROTC programs
sprung up across the country, opening polo
to a wider demographic than ever before.
When the atom bomb demonstrated
cavalry's obsolescence, the Army ended the
ROTC program, and Yale polo alumni
bought the horses and equipment. To the
present day, donations from polo clubs
across the country
have kept Yale polo
playing. In addi-
tion
to
direct
financial
dona-
tions,
the
club
actual
receives
horses, which can
then be kept or
sold. "Tommy Lee
Jones gave us a
pony. He was too
tall though, so we
sold
him,"
says
Charlie. The names of these donated horses
often indicate their origins: Manzana and
Sanchez's names reveal their Argentinian
hedtage, where the best polo is played.
However, some donated horses arrive with-
out names, and indicative of how equestrian
spons have changed, the Polo Team recent-
ly named a horse, Yo Mama. "Just think
about being able to say, 'I am riding Yo

..
Mama tonight,' or 'Yo Mama is lame,' or
even 'I made Yo Mama sweat last night,"'
explains

Polo
captain
Philippa Pavia.
Outside of college, many students
would find equestrian sports cost-prohibi-
tive, requiring "payment for a horse, board-
ing fees, vet bills, shoeing and lessons. Here
you just pay for lessons," explains Liz
Jordan, a junior in Berkeley and captain of
the Yale Equestrian Team, started in 1985 as
another club equestrian sport. The work of
this team is showmanship: controlling the
horse, jumping, and displaying finesse. Last
year Jordan made it to nationals, a feat that
a teammate describes as "a miracle" consid-
ering that the Equestrian Center, today's
incarnation of the Armory, is inadequate
for her team's work. All Equestrian Team
members, except for beginners, pay for
lessons at a private barn outside New
Haven.
The few horses owned by the
Equestrian Team are not in good enough
shape, and the footing in the practice arena
is so hard that were the horses to jump, their
legs would break.
A few years ago the
Equestrian Team began a campaign to get
the University to renovate the Center, but
after a private
renovation
assessment
yielded a fig-
ure close to
ten
million
dollars,

Depart-
ment has been
unwilling to
make

a
priority. Without a doubt, everyone would
love to see a renovated barn.
But the
Equestrian Team has been more vocal than·
the Polo Team. "You know, the thing about
a barn," says one polo player, "is that it's
never gonna be pristine." The Polo Team
can fully function in the current center,
which was after all made for polo, whereas
the Equestrian Team cannot.
