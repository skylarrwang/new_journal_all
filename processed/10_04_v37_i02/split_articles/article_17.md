America's first Asian graduate, but 
also 
Yale's first, unofficial Asian Admissions 
Offtcer. He became the missionary: The 
Yale spirit was a part of him, and he sought 
to spread it. "His American experience was 
so good he wanted other Chinese to have 
that experience," History Professor Beatrice 
Bartlett said, emphasizing the extent 
to 
which Wing's American experience was 
shaped by the personality of the University 
and state of Connecticut. "It was very much 
a Connecticut project. A lot of families up 
and down the Connecticut Valley were 
involved with helping Yung Wing." His 
program, which sent a group of 30 students 
of varying ages to study in America for a 
year, was revolutionary at the time, antici-
pating the course that international study 
would eventually take. By 1881, however, 
his mission dwindled due to conflict 
between Wing's vision of education and 
myopic 
Chinese 
administrators 
who 
expressed 
dissatisfaction 
with 
the 
Americanization of the young Chinese stu-
dents who matriculated from the program. 
Wing was forward-thinking: he had "con-
sciously placed himself between cultures," 
says Dean Koh, alluding to the way 
in 
which Wing forever changed the Asian 
experience of being "yellow in a white 
world," a phrase that traces back to 1850 
when he arrived on campus and changed 
America. Wing could not, however, change 
China. 

Yung Wing's precocious plans antici-
pated today's link between scholarship and 
governmental reform. The collapse of his-
project is one chapter in a long history of 
tension between the Chinese government 
and Western scholarship. By the beginning 
of the twentieth century, the Yale spirit had 
evolved to reflect an emphasis on interna-
tional education. This was one impetus for 
the founding of Yale-in-China (later the 
Yale-China Association) in 1901. During 
Yale's bicentennial anniversary, Yale-in-
China, a non-profit not directly linked to 
the University, began to set a different 
precedent for cultural exchange. Yale owed 
its new ties to China to the legacy of Yung 
Wing. The nature of these ties, however, 
was at stake. As the organization took shape, 
it had to define both itself and how it would 
interact with Yale. 

Terrill E. Lautz, Ph.D, Vice President 
and Program Director for Asia of the Henry 
Luce Foundation, which offered essential 
October 2004 
fiscal support and manpower at the time 
Yale-in-China was founded, articulates 
another driving force behind Yale-in-China: 
"Four generations of Luces have gone to 
Yale. Henry R. Luce was born in China and 
his father was a missionary there. The con-
nections were personal and historical." 

Lautz, who has his own personal history 
with the Yale-China Association, is an 
extension of the tradition that the Luces 
made possible. In the early 1980s, as a Yale-
China teaching fellow, Lautz went to Hong 
Kong when China was "just opening up." 
Today, in addition to his prominent role at 
the Luce Foundation, he is chairman of the 
Yale-China Association Board of Directors, 
on which Henry Luce III is an Honorary 
Trustee. Yale-China has now created a 
dynasty of its own. As a non-profit affiliate 
of Yale, its history is wrapped up in the 
. 
. ' 
msntutlons. 

This lineage is only one aspect of the 
legendary relationship between Yale and 
China. When it was founded, it began to 
work aggressively to initiate medical and 
educational institutions in China 
includ-
ing a mission based on "a facilitation of 
meaningful exchange." Here was an institu-
tional manifestation of the munificent Yale 
spirit. Still, it faced serious setbacks, repeat-
edly coming up against . antagonistic 
Chinese political policy. The first Yale-in-
China institution, Yali Middle School, 
named for the Chinese phonetic approxi-
mation of"Yale," was founded in 1901 as a 
centerpiece of the young association's mis-
sion. However, from 1920-1927, national 
unrest in China forced the evacuation and 
closure of several established ventures, 
including Yali Middle School. By the l930s, 
these organizations were flourishing again, 
only to be uprooted during World War II to 
temporary relief areas in western China. 
Only in 1979 would the association resume 
normal programming. 

Marking the beginning of the restora-
tion of the Mainland institutions that it had 
been forced to abandon thirty years before, 
in 1975, Yale-in-China renamed itselfYale-
China. According to Christin Sandweiss, 
Director of Development at the Yale-China 
Assocation, the name was changed "to 
reflect that the organization was not [physi-
cally] present in China, as no American 
groups were. We had focused programming 
in Hong Kong until the return of diplomat-
ic relations in 1979," when the impressive 
modern history of the Association really 
begins. 

In 
the sixty trips 
that Nancy 
Chapman, Ph.D., cq.rrent Director of the 
Yale-China Association, has made to 
China, she has seen vast, sweeping change. 
"There is so much more common ground 
now than there was when I first started 
working with China," she says of her begin-
. nings almost thirty years ago as a Yale-
China teaching fellow. The 1990s wit-
nessed an enormous expansion of program-
ming for Yale-China, including a fellowship 
program to encourage women in the public 
health sector, HIV I AIDS education, the 
English Teaching Fellowship Program, 
potent legal education programs, encour-
agement of a nascent non-profit sector 
through service internships and. of course, 
continued support of both new and well-
established academic and medical institu-
tions. Many of these programs are novel in 
a Communist nation where democratic 
websites are blocked, and NGOs are still 
perceived as fronts for subversive political · 
activity. "What we seek to do," says Ms. · 
Chapman, "is draw on the strengths of 
Yale's traditions and engage members of the 
Yale community with China. Our mission 
is shared with our Chinese colleagues." 

n the wall at the Yale-China 
Association at the corner of 
Temple and Trumbull hangs a 
bulldog-blue, felt pennant that reads "Yali" 
in the same blocky, confident typeface 
found on the "Yale" sweatshirts worn here 
on cold Connecticut days. Like the sweat-
shirts, the pennant is a symbol. For Ms. 
Chapman, it represents tradition 
"a Yale 
tradition which we think is a real strength. 
The spirit of service that from [Yale-
China's] founding, and in the past 100 
years especially, infuses Yale-China, infuses 
all of our work." Yale-China is following in 
the footsteps of Reverend Samuel Brown. 

The Yale-China Association serves as a 
cable of energy, enthusiasm, and resources 
between Yale and China. "What is most 
enduring is its deep impact on people's 
lives 
how it transforms," says Ms. 
Chapman. "Our goal is to be true to the 
tradition." Ms. Chapman denies that Yale-
China is at the vanguard of significant 
changes, on the horizon of an open China: 
"Our Chinese colleagues are at the fore-
front of change. My hope would be that

China can reconcile competing impulses." 

It is important to note that while Yale-
China has a hyphenated connection to Yale; 
it is very much separate from the University. 
Though Yale-China is made possible by its 
prestigious affiliation, in stark contrast to 
the University, Yale-China seeks to act with-
out any political agenda. 

Yale has pursued China with the grow-
ing promise of a bright Chinese future. The 
Yale Office of International Affairs pub-
lished a 39 page booklet 
the first half of 
which is in Chinese 
entitled "Summary of 
Yale University's Current Collaborations in 
China.'' This booklet outlines the involve-
ment of Yale departments and schools in 
"advancing the frontiers of knowledge," 
President Richard Levin's introduction 
states. The projects, though diverse, share a 
spirit of possibility and reform. For one 
thing, China has given Yale an incompara-
ble new pool of talent and cutting edge 
technology. China has enriched Yale's 
research programs, especially in the sciences . 
Perhaps one of the most compelling studies, 
conducted by Dr. Zhinan Yin of the . 
Rheumatology Department, examines the 
use of Chinese herbs in the treatment of 
cancers . 

The investment Yale has made in 
China is reciprocal; yet, Yale will inevitably 
leave th_e nation changed. The China Law 
Center, founded at the Yale Law School in 
1999, whose abstract in the Yale Office of 
International Affairs booklet highlights its 
cooperative mission, is headed towards legal 
reform. The center "has built strong work-
ing relationships with Chinese institutions 
and experts that are central to current legal 
reform efforts, including academic institu-
tions, the legal profession and government 
entities." The center is undoubtedly on the 
front lines of a significant legal revolution. 
"Chinese democratic websites may be 
blocked today, but they can't be blocked 
tomorrow," says Dean Koh, thrusting at the 
immediacy of this work. For the institution 
of Yale, as opposed to Yale-China, the Yale 
spirit has morphed again, into a type of 
geopolitical reform movement. When 
China opens up, Yale will have been a motor 
that both powered the changes and was also 
affected by them. 

This explains why China was splashed 
across the front page of the Yale Dally 
News four times in September. Yale's inter-
est in China is not new; but it is becoming

a priority. "It is the now that's interesting," 
says Jonathan Spence, Professor of History 
and author of The Search for Modern 
China. ,"Yale really thinks itself to be a top 
flight school. It has to have this internation- . 
al dimension." Beatrice Bartlett echoes this 
sentiment by identifying the evolving link 
between Yale and China with ironic clarity: 
"Globalization is the one word answer." In 
fact, words like globalization, mutualism, 
cross-cultural exchange, and universalism 
are not just part of an academic discourse; 
they have become policy words. The 
University has integrated this new vocabu-
lary into its repertoire, a result of a thriving 
trend towards international education. 

Globalization may be the new Yale spirit. 
"[This is] a new kind of melting pot, and I 
think Yale is correct to join it, even to be a 
spearhead," says Jonathan Spence. "China is 
a nation of consequence. Most of this seems 
to be not-for-profit, though it's hard to 
guess what that means," he says. It is unde-
niable that globa,l educition is essential; but, 
doe$ globfl} education imply globalization? 
"The key goal for us here at Yale is to keep 
Y~e as one of the global universities," Koh 
said. "One of the core elements of my agen-
da as incoming dean is globalization." It is 
difficult to guess exactly what he means by 
that. 

. There is no clear-cut answer to the 
question of what globalization means to 
Yale. One gauge of the University 
the Yale 
search engine-returned 5,680 hits for "glob-
alization" in .3 seconds. Other gauges · are 
the YaleGlobal, the magazine recently 
founded by the Yale Center for the Study of 
Globalization, and the Yale Center for 
International and Area Studies which has 
risen to prominence in recent years. When 
former President Bill Clinton carne to speak 
here last year to welcome former Mexican 
President Ernesto Zedillo's appointment as 
Executive Director of the Yale Globalization 
Center, Clinton delivered a "Public Address 
on Globalization," using words like "inter-
dependence," "community," and "shared 
responsibilities," to explain how, because of 
technology, economy, and diplomacy, "we 
can not escape each other." This reaffuma-
tion of a "global social system" resonated 
strongly in the cavernous Woolsey Hall and 
needn't have echoed far to be understood. 

As arguably one of the strongest bul-
warks of thought in the United States, Yale 
has always, though perhaps not directly, 
been a part of the global social system. Yet,. 
Yale's relationship yvith China points to . a 
new politico-university policy that takes the 
national tenets of globalization and incor-
porates them into university action, though 
not without debate. Globalization seems 
simultaneously to legitimize and decry Yale's 
relationship with China. Dean Koh stated, 
"People can change institutions."·Yale's link 
with China demonstrates that institutions 
can also change people. 

"Although Yale's involvement with 
China dates back over a century, I don't 
think there is anything necessarily natural 
about Yale in China," remarks Professor 
Seth Fein. The purity of a global classroom 
is at odds with another political current 
deeply embedded in a Yale education. "We 
are living in a moment when people talk 
about globalization, when there is a conver-
gence between geopolitics of the United 
States economy and diplomacy, a moment 
when Yale is following and also reproducing 
US foreign policy, as it did a century ago," 
Fein explained. This phenomenon ofYale as 
a mini-nation raises questions about its 
intentions. Fein does not question the 
benevolence of a cross-cultural academic 
exchange yet concedes that Yale is "asserting 
a new kind of regionalism. It is notable that 
Yale has accelerated exchanges with academ-
ic universities in these regions," namely 
China, but also Mexico. These contentious 
countries, which have been the focus of 19th 
and 20'h century expansionism, notes 
Professor Fein, have reasserted themselves in 
a post-Cold War US foreign policy. These 
countries are potential diplomatic sources of 
exported US power, hot spots that offer new 
production possibilities both polici~ and 
material. "It is also dear that just as 
American businesses see China as a labor 
market, it is true that Universities-not just 
Yale 
have followed these politics." Yale's 
politics suggests its stronghold in China is 
neither coincidental nor accidental. Yale's 
politics are, however, influential. 

rofessor Wei Su of the East Asian 
Languages and Literatures depart- · 
ment offers a personal story as evi-
dence. In 1994, a revolutionary (in all sens-
es of the word) Chinese scholar, who pub-
lishes feminist, gender and sexuality criti-
cism of Chinese literature, came to Yale to 
teach with an H4 visa, his family in tow. Six 
years later, in 2000, he returned to China to 
visit his mother. Soon after he arrived, he 
says, "state security agents broke into my 
mother's apartment and arrested me. I had 
to be. detained for three days. My brother 
promptly made a call to our Department 
Chair at Yale. She immediately informed 
this emergency to President Levin who 
asked the State Department to release me." 
That day, Su was released. He h~ not gone 
home since. This incident is only.one exam-
ple of the power and presence of Yale in an 
international diplomatic dialogue. 

Professor Su's new work, being translat-
ed into English by a Harvard Ph.D., trans-
lates to My Autobiography as a 
Reactionary Element. "China," says Su, 
"is a very complex problem. I cannot 
· explain it clearly to you. The Communist 
Party government just reformed to a market 
economy, but they never want to make 
political reforms. This is a serious problem." 
He offers examples of death sentencing, 
beatings, detainments, and human rights 
violations to express his frustrations with 
China's difficulties reconciling irs status as a 
world power. In Chinese, he says, "the word 
'Reactionary' 
is 
almost 
_equal 
'Counterrevolutionary."' His book promises 
to be one more current of change that can 
be traced to Yale. Has it also been imbued 
with a new Yale spirit? 

Yale seems to think that the question of 
China opening up is not "if" but "'Yhen." 
And when it does occur, Yale will assuredly 
play a prominent role in determining the 
gestalt of that new nation. The range of 
Yale's responsibilities in municipal, national, 
and now international spheres forces Yale to 
set an example, much like Yung Wing did. 
One hundred fifty years ago, from his grad-
uation forward, the educational opportuni-
ties for millions -of Asians would be 
changed. Right now, Yale is at a crossroads. 
This is a critical moment in which Yale too 
can alter the lives of not millions, but 1.3 
billion.
