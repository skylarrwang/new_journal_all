In addition to clarity, figurative language was also judged when 
evaluating readability. We found TPA's menu to be a "page-turn-
er" 
the use of imaginative names such as "Waterfall Beef," "Mary 
Land," and "Thai Pan Fish Delight" (note the double entendre) was 
especially appreciated. PT overused the word "sizzli-ng" and was lin.:. 
guistically inconsistent 
employing both English and Thai in single 
titles. The PT menu was wordy and obfuscatory. Take note: "Soft 
shell crabs spicedwith unique aromatic garlic seasoning fried to per-
fection and topped with crispy garlic." 


In terms of selection, TPA is superior with the longest menu and 
a plethora of frog dishes not offered at any of the competing estab-
lishments. 

Gastronomic enjoyment in-meal (GEI-M) is ranked from · 0 
(lightheadedness and uncontrollable vomiting) to 5 (papillary ecsta-
sy). Gastronomic sensation post-meal (GSP-M) is primarily analyzed 
based on the presence of symptoms of gastric dilatation-volvulus 
after the meal-referred heretofore as the GDV-Test. Results of thiSJ 
test follow the following rubric: the lower the calculated number, the 
stronger the presence of GDV symptoms, including stomach-
wrenching, sweating, lightheadedness and death in some species of. 
dog. The aftermath of the TT meal was the sensory equivalent to the 
aftermath· following the consumption of a strong household cleanser 
heavily flavored with garlic. 

Discussion 

We will analyze the results based on three categories: dining 
pleasure, edibility and price. Dining pleasure, simply stated, is how 
much pleasure is accrued by a diner while eating. The presentation 
of the food on the plate, the ambient qualities of the restaurant, as 
well as the in-meal gastronomic feeling all affect dining pleasure. 
This is a broader category than edibility, which hones in on the food 
itself and asks the question: is it edible? The edibility score, in this 
context, is calculated based on the capacity per person to consume 
and enjoy TF Z, from restaurant Y. This capacity includes in-meal 
gastronomic pleasure, as well as post-meal gastronomic sensation and 
any specific characteristics of the food that might affect its capacity 
to be consumed. Price is based on dollars and hundredths of dollars 
spent per Item. 

TT scored highest for the dining pleasure category. The restau-
rant was full, warm, and the presentation was highly stimulating. 
Furthermore, the food tasted good in-meal. TPA was observably 
deficient in the decor and presentation category: there were two 
other patrons in the establishment. 

Calculating edibility required taking the derivative of the fol-
lowing algorithm: 

_ 
· 
[2(GDV Score) + --J(In-Meal Pleasure)]/[(1/Grease Quotient * 
Spice) *Texture *21t(Taste)]

TT was disadvantaged by its GDV-Test score of -9.9x10"23, 
putting it behind even PT. TPA was the inost successful restaurant 
in this category 
only losing points for its overwhelming spiciness. 

A shot of epinephrine (to reverse anaphylactic shock) is recom-
mended to aid in the consumption of any dish labeled "hot and 
spicy." PT was a close second because consumption did not result 
in severe bloating. However, the high abundance of grease in every 
dish left it wanting for first place. Even the soup slid down a little 
too quickly and left one's tongue coated with a slimy residue. 
Additionally, although there were no signs of GDV in tasters, one 
diner referred to his post-meal sensation as that of a "chicken stab-
bing me, drawing intestinal blood, and then the peanut sauce cau-
terizing the wound." PT, however, did win the price category 
it 
is, on average, cheaper than the other two restaurants. To conclude, 
this author recommends Thai Pan Asian-because despite the fact 
that the average dish costs an additional 40 cents and the restau-
rant lacks pictures ofThai princesses, edibility is deemed the high-
est pnonty.
