S AN 
UNDERGRADUATE, Joyce 
Chen wanted to do something to 
curb violence in New Haven, but · 
when six people were shot with a machine 
gun just outside her block watch meeting, 
Joyce began to act. "I started to talk to peo-
ple about the issue and ultimately I ended 
up moving from Dwight Street. I realized 
that in order to really understand these 
issues and to have greater impact, I ought to 
live in an area where I could be exposed to 
the problems on a daily basis," she says. So 
Chen, who had graduated from Yale in May 
2001, ran for Ward 2 Alderwoman the same 
fall, and was elected. She bought a home on 
"K Street," as she calls it, or Kensington 
Street, intending to live in New Haven per-
manently. Today, with plans to further the 
cause of violence prevention, she is running 
against Toni Walker for State Representative 
in the 9 3rd district. 


Many Yalies hardly experience New 
Haven beyond Yale's blocks, but of those 
who do find their way into the city, some 
linger after graduation. Many who stay 
work for non-profits. Other graduates look 
to progressive Mayor John DeStefano, who 
opens his office to eager, young students. 
Indeed, many find their own New Haven 
niche to contribute to the economic and 
· social revitalization of the city. 


Janna Wagner, a New Haven native 
and 1995 Yale graduate, realized as ·an 
undergraduate that politics were the best 
way to involve herself in the community. 
Now she has taken on the role of den moth-
er for a network ofYale graduates who have 
chosen to make their homes in the Elm 
City. Upon graduation, Wagner left New 
Haven but quickly decided to come back. 
As a Yale graduate working in New Haven, . 
she set up a list-serve to. provide a network 
for others in her position. Emails were sent, 
meetings were held and the list grew from 
two to 318 people. The electronic list 
evolved intO a social forum, through which 
not only wine-tastings and scavenger hunts 
were organized, but local business and polit-
ical issues affecting this community were 
discussed. Over the past five years, Wagner 
claims there has been an increase in the 
number of Yalies who have permanently 
adopted New Haven. "We try to get other 
people excited about staying in New Haven. 
. We invite some of the students who stay in 
New Haven over the summer to show that 
New Haven is a cool, vibrant place to live as 
a young person." With this pitch, Wagner is 
one ofNew Haven's greatest public relations 
advocates. 


Michael Montano, who graduated 
in '93, grew interested in staying in the city 
after he joined the effort to prevent Fair 
Haven's English Station power plant from 
re-opening. The effort was already under-
way under the leadership of another Yalie, 
Julio Gonzalez, who was serving as the 
Ward 1 Alderman. Montafio enlisted in the 
effort to help protect the nearby residential 
areas from this asthma-inducing plant. 


Chen also found herself motivated by 
local movements to improve the city, even 
before she became interested in going into 
New Haven politics. As undergraduates, she 
and her friend Duff Morton started an orga-
nization called Direct Outreach 
a group 
of students who went to the New Haven 
green to help the homeless camped there. "I 
started feeling more connected to New 
Haven when I started venturing out into the 
community: not being concerned about 
safety issues, seeing New Haven at odd 
hours of the night, and realizing that most 
people's fears are unnecessary, exaggerated." 
It was only when Chen graduated that she 
understood the most effective way to help 
those in need: fight for them with a legiti-
mate political voice. Even though other 
Yalies had moved swiftly from social work 
to city politics, Joyce avoided the beaten 
path 
working with the powerful New 
Haven Democratic Party 
and chose to run 
as a Green. "I investigated the Green Party 
right after I graduated. When I was thinking 
about running, I really felt like I didn't want 
to be tied ·into the machine. I felt like it 
would be difficult to be a Democrat and to 
be independent of that," Chen explains. 


Plus, the New Haven chapter of the Green 
Party surprised Chen. "The party wasn't the 
stereotypical tree-buggers, but people who 
were educated, cared about issues and were 
fighting against the machine." 


Like Chen, Michael Montafio took his 
service experiences to heart and was driven 
to join New Haven's political system. He 
chose the Dems, a decision that should have 
afforded him greater political capital. After 
all, Gonzalez had offered to endorse his can-
didacy for Ward 1 Alderman. But even with 
the endorsement, Montafio faced a compet-
itive race, and the long-touted invincibility 
of the Democratic support let him down. 


Among his opponents was a new arrival, 
freshman Ben· Healey, who, with only limit-
ed experience, found himself with a seat in 
the 
aldermanic 
chamber 
at 
City Hill. 


Ben Healey, who would rise to promi-
nence during his four years as alderman, 
would not have entered the Democratic 
Party had it not been for his friend's older 
sister, Anika Singh, who told Healey, at an 
unremarkable Slifka dinner, "You should 
run." Healey, who comes from an extreme-
ly liberal background, was not necessarily 
the obvious choice. Yet Singh saw in him a 
motivated, idealistic freshman unsullied by 
political ambition. After several weeks of 
contemplating running for a position he 
knew little about, he made a decision that 
would shape his next four years at Yale. He 
decided to do it. After the ballots were 
counted, Healey found himself walking il!to 
City Hall, an 18-year-old college student 
with a day job, alongside thirty adults all 
working to run the city. 


Healey admits that he was not prepared 
for the committee meetings, budget minu-
tia and clashing personalities he found in his 
new job. So he tried to compensate for his 
inexperience. "It was a time of great defen-
siveness for me. I had to pretend I knew a 
lot more than I did, while still figuring out 
how to ask the right questions to learn all 
the things I needed to know." He also rec-
ognizes the sacrifices he has made. "I cer-
tainly gave up a great deal in terms of my 
college experiences, given the amount of 
time, energy, mental capacities I dedicated 
to New Haven," he said. "It's not like get-
ting up on a soapbox and having people lis-
ten to you." Nevertheless, Healey says he 
doesn't regret becoming an alderman. "It 
means something different to read democra-
tic theory in class when you are actually· 
involved in it in New Haven." Despite the 
strength of Yale's curriculum, no classroom 
can compare to the education New Haven 
politics offer. 


But students do not have to win elect-
ed office to benefit from a hands-on city 
education. Currently six undergraduates 
intern in the Mayor's office, including 
Marlon Castillo, Beth France and Whitney 
Haring-Smith. Castillo says he was sur-
prised by the amount of responsibility he 
has been given and the number of projects 
on which he has worked. France, who 
became interested in politics through 
Project Orange, a gay-rights advocacy 
group, found that working in the Mayor's 
public information office taught her. how 
dynamic the city really is. She has gained an 
insider appreciation for the nuances of city 
government. 


For a growing minority of students, 
graduating from Yale does not mean gradu-
ating from New Haven. Robert Smuts, Kate 
McAdams, and Chrissy Bonano all graduat-
ed in 200 1 and now work together in the 
Mayor's office. Former Alderman Julio 
Gonzalez was the executive assistant to the 
Mayor until he stepped down this past 
August. Smuts was recently promoted to 
Deputy Chief of Staff. Several other Yalies 
who have stayed on, namely Karen Dubois-
Walton and Henry Fernandez, 
have 
attained 
important 
positions: 
Chief 
Administrative Officer and Economic 
Development 
Administrator of New 
Haven, respectively. 


This is an exciting time for young 
Yalies 
involved 
in 
New 
Haven 
politics 
that is, if they are progressive. 


Sophie Raseman, who graduated in 2004, 
said that in a largely democratic city, those 
who subscribe to a conservative ideology are 
less likely to stay because there is little 
opportunity to become involved in party 
politics. Even progressives may prefer to 
work in grassroots organizations, rather 
than in city politics. Raseman took a com-
mon route into New Haven politics when 
she started canvassing for Ben Healey, a _ 
frien.d of hers, when he ran for re-election. 
As a freshman, the New York native remem-
bered thinking, "This is a one-horse town. 
I've got to get out of here. I should have 
gone to Columbia." She soon recognized 
New Haven as a potential springboard to 
greater political involvement. Her experi-
ence changed politics from something :: 
abstract 
"something 
people 
do 
on 
CNN" 
to a tangible way to make a differ-
ence. Politics became such a huge force in ·
her life that after graduation she chose to 
make her home in the same city she was 
once intent on leaving. 


In the words of Janna Wagner, "People 
our age are getting re-energized to the polit-
ical process. People have gotten passionate." 


Maybe that's why Beth France remarked 
that those who are most active in local poli-
tics have already begun to speculate about 
who will make up the next generation of 
student politicians. There is always a steady 
stream of team-players to work at City Hall 
and non-profits, but the path to winning an 
alderman's seat is more demanding. Healey 
has been thinking _ about who to endorse 
and, like Gonzalez, he may step down early 
and invoke a committee vote to fill the 
remainder of his term, due to end soon. In 
an era when New Haven is undergoing vast 
improvements, more students are consider-
ing staying. An aldermanic seat, more than · 
ever before, may seem like the ideal first step 
into city politics for Yale graduates. Healey 
hopes to choose a freshman, ·perhaps as 
unsuspecting and unprepared as he was in 
January of2000. He admits it is a huge task 
for a freshman to take on, but he wants 
someone who can serve for at least as long 
as he has. 


Cynthia Okechukwu, a current fresh-
man, got her first taste of politics by can-
vassing for Chen's opponent, Toni Walker, 
after she was encouraged by Yale junior, 
Alyssa Rosenberg, current Ward 22 co-chair. 
Okechekwu was not involved in politics 
before coming to Yale, but decided that 
since she will be turning 18 soon and will 
have the right to vot~, she wants to be more 
politically engaged. She chose Yale because 
she found it to be more integrated into the 
city than the other schools she had consid-
ered. Right now, she is just a freshman tak-
ing her first steps out ofYale's gates and into 
the city. But in four years, she could be 
packing up her Yale dorm room, only to 
move the boxes down the street.
