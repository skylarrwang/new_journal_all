On the Evaluation of Consumables from 
the Nation of Thailand at a Cross-section of 
Restaurants in New Haven, Connecticut, or 
UTongue-thaied.~~ 

Introduction 

The presence of three restaurants containing the word "Thai" in 
their nomenclature, in a 42-foot radius, compels the average Thai 
food (TF) consumer to ask him/herself: at which venue shall I con-
sume? Put another way, given that the distance from consumer X to 
a given restaurant Y is negligible, in which restaurant should con-
sumer X consume? To this end, we have endeavored to identifY cer-
tain defining characteristics of each establishment, so that a discern-
ing consumer could evaluate for him/herself, based on his/her pref-
erences, which restaurant best suits his/her needs. We then proceed 
to analyze these properties and venture an overall recommendation. 

The three establishments under observation are Thai Taste 
(TT), Pad Thai (PT) and Thai Pan Asian (TPA). They are located 
on Chapel Street, in the quadrangle formed · by the cross streets of 
York and Park in New Haven, Connecticut. These restaurants make 
up 50o/o (3 of 6) restaurants on that segment of Chapel Street. 

Methodology 

On Consuming Vast Quantities ofTF 

The data for this article is based on direct consumption of TF 
by the author. Gastrointestinal fortitude permitted the author to 
consume four Thai dinners in the course of a single week {week of 
October 1, 2004). The first meal occurred at Thai Pan Asian, the 
second at the Thai Taste "cart" located on the junction of York and 
Elm Streets, the third at Pad Thai, and the fourth at Thai Taste. At 
each meal, there were from two to thirteen tasters (including the 
aforementioned author, who was present at every tasting), and there 
were two stipulations: (1) two dishes ("Drunken Noodles" and 
"Tom Yum Goong Soup") were to be kept constant at each venue 
and (2) a (relatively) diverse selection was tested. 

Modus Operandi of Documentation 

Materials required: 1. Pencil and 2. Paper 

TF consumption was accompanied by a thorough note-taking 
process documenting the experience, with special attention to (a) 
decor and presentation, (b) in-meal gastronomic pleasure, and (c) 
post-meal sensation. Symptoms of gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) 
were the primary criteria for judging post-meal sensation. A disease 
found commonly in basset hounds, GDV occurs when consumables 
are consumed in excessive quantities, resulting in drastic bloating of 
the stomach: 
· ''As the stomach swells, it may rotate 90 to 360 degrees, twisting 
between its · flXed attachments at the esophagus and at the duode-
num. The. twisting stomach traps air, food, and water in the stom-
ach. The bloated stomach obstructs veins in the abdomen, leading to 
low blood pressure, shock, and damage to internal organs. The com-
bined effect can quickly kill a dog."i 

The presence or absence of signs or symptoms of GDV will be 
evaluated in the Results section. 

Thaicumulation and Other Caveats: A Frank Discussion 

The concentrated consumption ofThai food resulted in thaicu-
mulation, ·the dangerous and potentially fatal build-up of Thai food 
in the human digestive system {see Figures l.a. and l.b.). For the 
layperson, this phenomenon can be understood as something akin to 
an overdose. The symptoms of thaicumulation 
most notably, a viscer-
al repulsion to the possibility of consuming a single further drunken 
noodle or curry soaked bamboo shoot 
may have biased the results, 
especially for the fourth restaurant, TT. In addition to the quantita-
tive over-consumption, the intervals between meals also varied and 
may have resulted in some outliers. Two meals (PT anc:t TT) were 
consumed on consecutive evenings (the evenings of October 4 and 
5). This became a potential methodological design flaw evidenced at 
the TT dinner, where this taster not only showed psychosomatic 
signs of overdose but also demonstrated dramatic symptoms of food 
poisoning, including sweating, fever and intense abdominal pain. 
Though food poisoning is most commonly caused by picnics, school 
cafeterias and mayonnaise-based dishes at large social functions, and 
not often associated with too much consump-
tion of o·ne type of food, it should not be excluded as a 
possible explanation for this taster's severe reaction.

Figure 1. Cross-Comparison of Fiscal Accessibility of Dinner Items 

This graph charts the prices of a cross-section of dinner items at 
the three restaurants sampled. Striking discrepancies are evident. 
TPA charges 45 cents more for its soups and satays than both PT and 
TT. In fact, the appetizers are over 50 cents more on average at TPA 
than at PT and TT. For noodles, TT is significantly more expensive: 
all noodle dishes are $7.50, whereas at the other restaurants nearly all 
noodle dishes (barring those including duck and some types of 
seafood) are $6.95. Specialty fried rice, including basil and pineapple 
varieties, varies dramatically from $6.50 at PT, to $6.95 at TPA, to 
$7.50 at TT. It is worth noting that the difference between the selec-
tion of chicken, vegetable and seafood (in relation to curries and 
entrees) is more pronounced at TPA and PT-ranging from $6.95 for 
vegetable curry to $10.95 for seafood. See Table 1. 

Table I. Prices for Curries and Entrees Based on Substance 

The most restrictive prices are highlighted for each category. It 
can be concluded that if one's appetite calls for shrimp or squid, 
quality of food should be the sole determining factor in restaurant 
choice as all the prices are eerily identical. For "Mixed Seafood," TT 
yields the best value-but staying in character, TT is certainly the 
worst value for "Vegetable/Tofu." 

Decor and Presentation effectively refer to the 
ambient qualities of the restaurant, an important factor con-
ventional diners consider when dining-out. 
Presentation refers to the manner in which the 
food is arranged by its arranger 
ranging from 0-
5; 0 being roughly equivalent to e.g. pig slop, 5, to 
the molecular structure of ice. TT was especially 
effective in its presentation of comestibles 
there 
was meticulous attention paid to the correlation 
of serving dishes to different categories of food-
type. While the elaborate decor of TT was 
required to counteract the fact that the restaurant_ 
is located in a basement of a ratty hotel, the por-
traits of Thai people (their Thai heritage has not 
been proven. One guest remarked that they seem 
more likely Hawaiian, based on their bone struc- . 
ture) more than make up for the subterranean 
level. 

Table2 
TPA was favored for menu readability and 
selection. TPA has a logical menu every dish is denoted with a let-
ter-number system. A majuscule alpha ('~") corresponds to the 
group of appetizers while "F" corresponds to frog (a category which 
favored TPA heavily in the breadth of selection comparison). 
However, a conflict arose between salads and soups for the letter "S," 
and salads were arbitrarily assigned the letter "Y." (This logic gap 
seems largely unavoidable and was not counted as a point deduction, 
although such a deduction was pondered, and eventually abandoned.) 
potentially irreconcilable problem is that the group headings seem 
redundant and confounding. For example, there exists a general 
category but also a crab, salmon and fish category (the join-
ing of shellfish with their barely-related gill-fish cousins seemed arbi-
trary at best-further, the separation of "salmon" from the other cate-: 
gories of similar dorsal-finned fish was preponderous). This problem 
was identified on every single menu, however, and as it was uniform, 
it did not render a deduction.
