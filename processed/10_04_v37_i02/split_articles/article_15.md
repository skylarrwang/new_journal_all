or avowals that "my husband is okay."

Sometimes, families offer more 'than just support. When
DiSpirito's unit had its deployment extended a third time, Millie
DiSpirito knew she had to speak up. 'Tm from New York," she
quips. "This mouth has no hair on it." Millie organized a group of
wives of soldiers in the 439<h, w\:lo promised to "do whatever it takes"
to get the unit home. The group made a big enough stink to arouse
the attention of Congresswoman Rosa D eLauro and, eventually,
Senator Joe Lieberman. The Senator held a meeting for DiSpirito's
group but offered only vague words of consolation. By chance or
will, the unit was released a
month ahead of schedule. Mark
DiSpirito chalks up the success of
the early homecoming to the per-
sistence of his wife: "She was
instrumental
in
getting
us
'
home."

Many challenges accompany
the return of a loved one as a sin-
gle-parent household or an empty
nest reincorporates a member.
When a spouse returns, adjust-
ment can be difficult on both
sides. Soldiers must cast off the
months spent in cramped quar-
ters with their unit, while spouses
must adjust to a two-adult house-
hold in which both parents call
the shots.

The Family Program tries to
address what Hoffman dubs "the
initial phase of shock'' that sol-
diers experience when they come
home by staffing its centers with
psychologists. But in daily activi-
ty; many soldiers find themselves
feeling isolated. Neighbors offer
help, but few can relate to post-
service life. In Connecticut, where service is far from the norm, no
network exists for those who have served. Hoffman notes there are
few active duty officers here. Additionally, interest in joining the
reserves is dwindling
a new closure or realignment of bases occurs
every year. The dispersal of military families means more and more
are facing their individual difficulties in isolation.


But it could be worse. Although Connecticut leans left politi-
cally, military families say they have escaped the animosity that sol-
diers returning from Vietnam experienced. Millie DiSpirito remem-
bers a friend who served in the Vietnam War being called "murder-
er"; today, she says, people see soldiers in uniform and thank them.
Soldiers and families think of military service apolitically, as an occu-

pation, not a philosophy. And as such, while reservists agree their
overall function is "necessary," someone else, says Beckwith, could
easily be doing the job. Charlene Derasmo likes Kc:rry's policies,
while her husband leans toward Bush. Ideology, however, does not
come up in their conversations about D ominick's time in Iraq. As
lrman Webb puts it, soldiers are "not robots without political views
or opinions. It is just unprofessional to discuss those views while in
uniform.'' Parents of soldiers, Derasmo notes, tend to be slightly
more political. Parents "just want their kid out," while spouses have
to face the work as a reality of their marriage.


The absence of criticism,
however, does not imply active
support. Many families believe
their neighbors and towns could
do more to help. Laurie explains
that her community in the Lower
Naugatuck Valley is "supportive to
a point. They remember the ser-
vice member at the holiday time."
Charlene Derasmo feels the Same
way about Waterbury; "without a
personal involvement with the
issue, you sort of go on with your
life." Webb is concerned that the
public has become habituated to
the deaths of Americans overseas:
at the onset of the war, Webb
points out, a television report
would display a photo of a soldier
who was killed, followed by a brief
silence. Today, the names merely
scroll across the bottom of the
screen. "The media has stopped
giving our war dead the respect
that they _c).eserve," Webb says.

T he latest figures show that
while the army is meeting its
goals, recruitment and retention
of troops remain the army's chief concerns. Most of Connecticut's
reservists have faced or will soon have to face deployment, a reality
that prospective guardsmen now have to weigh before enlisting.
Chris Beckwith describes how the initial optimism upon entering
Iraq quickly gave way to a more complex reality: "When we first got
there, they thought it was just like flipping a switch," bur found the
task much more difficult. For many Connecticut households with a
family member at war, a similar sentiment holds.
