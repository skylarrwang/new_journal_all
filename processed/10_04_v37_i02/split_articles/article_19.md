from 
their 
cages all the 
time at the New 
· Animal 
Shelter. Some jump 
over the eight-foot 
cage door; others 
make a run for it 
while being fed or 
collared for a walk. 
On my first day as a 
volunteer, however, I 
let not one dog 
escape, 
but 
two. 


Before I could 
turn around, a lab 
mix and a pit bull were at each other's 
throats. "Bob!" I shouted. My new favorite 
kennel worker barged through the swinging 
doors and picked up both eighty-pound 
dogs by their scruffs, one in each hand, and 
returned them to their cages without a · 
word. 


Bob Bombace is like a four-man Special 
Forces unit. The police seek his help when 
they see a stray, and citizens call him when 
they suspect their neighbors of holding dog 
fights in their basements. When a coyote 
was found rooting through trash cans last 
year, Bob hopped in his van and brought it 
back to the shelter in a plastic dog kennel. 


The shelter is located about two miles 
from campus on Dixwell Avenue. A blue 
sign on th~ front lawn has been cor-
roded by many years and many more 
gallons of dog pee. A plastic bench 
molded in the shape of a couch, like the 
kind you see in a kid's playhouse, ·sits in the 
front room. Everything in the building 
must pass the can-it-be-peed-on test. The 
New Haven Animal Shelter, a division of 
the New Haven Police Department, is the 
largest shelter in Connecticut, taking in 
approximately 2,000 dogs and cats each· 
year and finding owners for 75 percent · of 
them. The shelter attracts over 3,200 visi-
tors annually and can accommodate more_ 
than 60 animals at once. This may seem like 
a lot, but the dog runs are almost always 
full. 


New Haven is a hard city. The few peo-
ple dedicated to caring for New .Haven's 
dogs see plenty of ugliness. Everyone at the 
shelter looks tired. Bob chain smokes what-
ever brand is on sale at the supermarket and 
doesn't say much without being hounded, 
"The job's difficult," he finally told me. 
"The pay is low; we're always short on staff, 
big on problems. It's difficult not to get 
burnt out. We're always looking for volun-
teers who can get past orientation. A lot of 
people look into an animal's eyes and realize 
they can only do so much. They don't like 
to stick around." 


Bob is inundated with negligencalls. 
The complaints go to him when a dog is 
spotted tied up in the snow or "hung," 
meaning the rope is too short for the dog to 
lie down. "It happens a lot," Bob said . 
"They tie them up and leave them outside, 
feed them once in a while and that's it." In 
high-crime areas like New Haven, dogs are 
often used as security devices. It is in cases 
like these that abuse most often occurs. 


One day last year, the shelter got a call 
about barking coming from an abandoned 
house. Bob found a white pit bull hung in 
the basement. She had been there about a 
week, ever since her owners were evicted. 
The dog was so weak that the staff named 
her Skinny and kept her in their office, 
where she slept most of the day in someone's 
lap. As Skinny put on weight, it became evi-
dent that she had been used to fight. The 
moment anyone put a leash on her, she 
jumped and snapped at the air for several 
minutes before eventually calming down. 
The staff wasn't surprised. A common prac-
tice is to leash and bait a dog before a fight, 
eventually creating a Pavlovian response to 
leashes and violence. Similar neuroses 
emerged that rendered Skinny un-adopt-
able. She was put down. 


New Haven is home to a fairly stan-
dardized ring of dog-fighting, using mostly 
pit bulls. Pit bulls are classically chosen as 
fight-dogs because they are strong and can 
be easily trained to fight. Anyone who has 
worked with pits, however, will attest to the 
fact that they are not naturally violent. 
According 
to 
Richard Johnson, 
President of the Connecticut Humane 
Society, "The real problem with pit bulls 
today comes from humans . . . . Since pit 
bulls are exceedingly loyal to their owners, 
an owner who wants a dog to be aggressive 
and reinforces this behavior can create an 
extremely aggressive dog." In fact, according 
to the American Canine Temperament . 
Testing Association, 95 percent of the pits 
that took its temperament test passed, com-
pared to a 77 percent average passing rate 
for all breeds. The pit bull ranks higher for 
temperment than cocker spaniels, german 
shepher~s, chow chows, and chihuahuas. 


Everyone who works at the shelter is 
especially concerned about the pits. "A lot of 
people don't want a dog with a scary face, 
no matter how sweet he is," volunteer Tania 
Sapko said. "It becomes a desperate under-
taking, finding a home for some of these 
guys. 


Despite the constant stream of interest-
ed adopters, finding homes for dogs is diffi-
cult. Taped on the inside of the office door, 
hidden from visitors, are eleven sheets of 
paper 
the "DO NOT ADOPT TO" list. 
Signs are made to warn against the people 
who seem like decent pet-owners and might 
fool the newer volunteers. '!DO NOT 
ADOPTTO SUSAN MARGOLIS 
wants 
a chow for outdoor dog!" Another pro-
claims, "DO NOT ADOPT TO JIM 
CLARKSON 
has two cats and no vet." 


The worst are the "DON'T EVEN THINK 
ABOUT IT ALL AROUND BAD" signs, 
scribbled 
permanent 
marker. 


Another group of would-be adopters are 
barely let in the front door. These are the 
people who create the need for shelters in
