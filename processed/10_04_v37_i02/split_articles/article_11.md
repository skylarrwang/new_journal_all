Excommmunicated
CHARGED WITH THE IMPORTANT TASK of
disciplining
Yalies
who
violate
the
Undergraduate
Regulations, . the
Yale
College Executive Committee (ExComm),
is surprisingly obscure. Most students know
next to nothing about the structure and
procedure of this miniature judicial body,
and few seem to care. The regulations hand-
book, dutifully distributed to freshmen dur-
ing orientation, is usually tossed into recy-
cling bins unread. Despite the University's
reputation of upholding justice and execut-
ing the top law school in the nation, stu-
dents seem apathetic to the application of
justice in their everyday lives.

Unless, of course, you do get into trou-
ble. Historically, trouble has meant any-
thing from shooting a BB gun, to urinating
on Yale property, to failing to cite sources in
a paper. One mischevious · sophomore,
Emmett*, learned the hard way that "throw-
ing objects of any kind from windows," is,
as stated in the Undergraduate Regulations
handbook, a punishable offense.

Last November, sitting in his freshman
dorm, Emmett and his roommate "got
bored." To amuse themselves, they "set fire
to objects" in their room and "dispatched
them out the window," as he described it-
entertainment that, according to Emmett,
he enjoyed all the time at home. Unlike at
home, where Emmett's actions hardly raised
an eyebrow, his little defenestrations did not
go unnoticed. The fire marshal arrived, fol-
lowed by the police. When the college dean
was alerted, the students knew they were in
trouble. "She was not pleased in any shape
or form," Emmett said. But his worries did
6
not end there. Emmett got a letter from the
ExComm, telling him that his alleged viola-
tion of undergraduate regulations had been
submitted as a complaint and that he would
have to testify before the ExCom~ boar,d.

Emmett was about to experience Yale's
elusive justice system for the first time. And
he had no idea what to expect. "I had only.
been in school for two months," he said,
recounting the experience with some disbe-
lief "I was very, freaked out."·

The ExComm is made up of six facul-
ty members, three undergraduates (usually
upperclassmen) and a presiding judge
Yale College Dean. The student's college
dean, present technically only for moral
d
"d
, ft
support an as an a vocate, o en repre-
sents the student in formal proceedings. In
some more serious cases, witneS.ses can be
asked to appear for questioning. There is
also no immunity for witnesses who testify.
Dealing with a fair number of sticky cases
each year, the ExComm has to do a lot of
homework to prepare for a hearing. Paige
Herwin '02, who served on the ExComm
her senior year, said members would get a
call from the Dean's secretary about the·
complaint and receive a ·confidential packet
of materials from the factfinder. This packet
contains information that the factfinder
puts together after talking to the victim, the
dean of both students, their friends, and the
"charged" student (a euphemism the
ExComm prefers over "accused").

At the hearing, the charged student, his
or her dean and sometimes the student's
personal law}'er are present. The ExComrn
questions the student and witnesses, listens
to the dean's statement, and then asks the
student and the dean to leave the room.
Each member in the ExComm, apart from
the secretary, then casts an anonymous vote
on whether the student has violated the
Undergraduate Regulations. However, stu-
dents usually don't dispute the charge,
Herwin says. The question is not usually
whether a violation actually occurred, but
how to assign consequences to the violation.
In other words, ExComrn rarely tries stu-
dents; more often it just doles out punish-
ments.

According to Dean Jill Cutler, who has
served as secretary of the ExComm for six
years, apart from the severity of the viola-
tion itself, the committee also takes into
consideration the student's attitude towards
what he or she has done, any past offenses,
and the consequences of the offense when
administering penalties. This may be the
reason why cheating is often less severely
punished than plagiarism
cheating is
regarded by ExComm as a panic reaction,
alludes Dean Cutler, while plagiarism
occurs after planning and reflection.

While there are no mandatory punish-
ments for violations (penalties are given on
a case-by-case basis), some standards apply.
For instance, according to Dean Cutler, the
typical penalty for plagiarism is two terms of
suspension. Still, even these standards are
subject to evolution. Assault offenders used ·
to only be "reprimanded," but with the rise
of serious assault cases, the ExComm decid-
ed to step up the punishment for assault to
a level "more closely comparable to penalties
for academic dishonesty."

So where did these standards put
Emmett, the dispatcher of burning objects?
Since Emmett did not dispute the charge
and his offense was relatively minor, the
process was straightforward. He merely had
to appear before the Coordinating Group of
the Executive Committee, which consists of
the chairman, the factfinder, and the secre-
tary.

And luckily for him and his roommate,
the Coordinating Group was not too harsh.
No fines, no letter of apology. They were
reprimanded, and allowed to go. "It was
sweet once it was over. It felt like I got out
of jail."
