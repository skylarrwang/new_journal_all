The Bookkeeper
"I HOPE THIS BITE'S NOT A SPIDER BITE,"
Patsy Recchia, the sole employee of· the
Bryn Mawr Book Shop, worries aloud as she
examines her inflamed thumb, adding, "90
percent of spiders in this state are

pOisonous.

A yellow hand-lettered sandwich board
advertising "Used arid Out-of-Print Books"
marks the entrance of an alley
between Kanavesky's Art Gallery
and a vacant piano salesroom on
Whitney Avenue. The intrigued
passerby who ventures down this
alley finds the bookshop's small but
inviting storefront. An owl figurine
perched on the window and a sub-
dued dog, Zoe, complement the
photograph-plastered
door.

Within, a copious and quirky col-
lection of timeworn tomes clutters
the dusty shelves, and the antique
atmosphere is well-matched by its
conscientious bookseller.

Inside the store, a small wood-
en placard announces key dates in
the store's history: " 1952-First

this
address is rumored to have been previously
occupied by a glue factory. T hough the fac-
tory is long-gone, there is still an abundance
of old glue: that which binds the store's
books. Among these lies The Bankrupt
Bookseller, an obscure volume from 1947,
by the charmingly pseudonymed Will Y.
Darling, whose tale begins, "I am a book-
seller. I am not a bookseller born and bred.
I am one who has come late to the craft but,
if late, not less lovingly. Books are a tran-
script of life, they say, but to me they are
more than the transcript. They are life
itself'' This quote could have come from
the mouth of Patsy Recchia, who has
worked at the shop full-time for nine years.

Patsy, like the innumerable owl fig-
urines that roost on every ledge in the shop's
entrance, appears wizened and certainly
4
bookish. She has the alert and genial air of
one deeply interested in stories, both of
books and of people. Like the bankrupt
bookseller, Patsy came late to the craft, after
previously spending 18 years a8 a profes-
sional photographer. Wedding photos, from
different periods, and Hollywood glamour
shots, comprise many of the old . pho..:
tographs on the walls and shelves. 1950s
paperback covers and postcards from song-
. Patsy has befriended. One former customer,
who graduated from Yale and moved from
New Haven several years ago, recently
returned to the shop to let Patsy know that
he. was engaged. Another customer, an air-
line pilot and Gary Cooper look-alike, tells
tales of dangerous distraction by female air-
plane passengers. A Long Wharf Theater
actor gave Patsy free tickets to a Eugen~
O'Neill play. Still others are "eccentric and
harmless," Patsy says. Developing
relationships with "these people who
are so incredibly interesting to me,"
she confides, is "the best part of the
job." Yet Phillips covertly shares that
Patsy "sometimes blasts CDs of
German poetry. I think she relishes
the complaints over that most of all."

Unlike the eponymous book-
seller, Patsy is far from bankrupt:
after financial difficulties in 2003, the
Bryn Mawr Book Shop is recovered
this year. Patsy mourns the passing of
the shop's main competitors, the
scholarly Foundry bookstore and the
used bookstore, Arathusa, which
David Zax
both went out of business a couple of
years ago. In addition to the loss of
competition, Patsy attributes the store's suc-
cess to the high quality of literature as well
as to her careful management. "Books don't
sell in boxes," she explains, so she meticu-
lously organizes them. Furthermore, Patsy
asserts, "I have total recall of books," confi-
dent she can point a customer to the precise
location of any volume. The books' quality
and variety depend on their previous own-
ers, an eclectic group including Professor
Charles Hill, George Plimpton's sister and
George W. Bush's uncle.


The thousands of donated books are
separated into categories: including litera-
ture, poetry, biography, art history, Yale lit-
erature, Everyman's Library, education and
rare books.

But hidden within lie unex-
pected finds, such as a signed book of
poems by Eugene McCarthy, a. pamphlet of
Alaskan folk -poetry, or what Phillips
describes as · "the unfinished account of an
allegorical journey to an unmappable island,
filed of all things under 'Mountain

Climbing,' on the sports shel£" The collec-
tion is extensive and fascinating, and deals
can be struck, particularly by the poor and
sympathetic college student.

New Haven's Bryn Mawr Book Shop
shares its name with several stores that pop-
ulate college towns and put the profits from
the sales of donated books toward scholar-
ships offered by Bryn Mawr College. These
need-based scholarships fund college tuition
as well as travel-fellowships and other edu-
cational endeavors. Until nine years ago, the
New Haven store was run by several elderly
volunteers. SiQ.ce then, under minimal man-
agement of owner Louise Carter, Patsy has
worked full-time. Like the mascot of all
Bryn Mawr Book Shops, the owl, the store
keeps · unusual hours: Tuesday through
Saturday, 11-4.

If "books are life itself," as Will Y.
Darling posits, then the Bryn Mawr Book
Shop, for all its dust and history, is not a
tomb for tomes, but a greenhouse of lively
stories, imaginative images, spirited peo-
ple and the occasional spider.
