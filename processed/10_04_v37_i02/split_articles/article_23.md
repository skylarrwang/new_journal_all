'.[""U.,L.. s ART GALLERY is passing off forged 
paintings to New York socialites. And 
married Meredith McFee, a femme 
tat:ale who has lured Yale into an illicit affair, 
blackmails him for sexual favors when she 
uncovers the forgeries. Meanwhile, Justine 
DiPerro, Yale's shopaholic fiancee, waits 
quietly at home, unaware of any deceit. Of 
course, Yale can do nothing to end either 
relationship: Justine's mob-boss father has 
always gotten her "whatever she wanted, 
including Yale." Bur Justine is beginning to 
feel that she and Yale belong to different 
worlds. "She didn't know anything about 
art, she thought bitterly, and she didn't like 
eating arugula and capers, and she didn't 
wear retro clothes." IfYale had his way, he'd 
pursue a third prospect, Lexi, the ravishing 
lover of his murdered twin brother, who 
spends her nights dreaming of Yale's "gold-
, 
en mane. 

Three women are bewitched by one· 
man, and the reason they want him is the 
reason we all want Yale: He is "exquisitely 
endowed." 

But he has other selling points: 
Page 395: Yale is "rich, powerful, and 
used to taking what he wants." 
Page 152: Yale has "sold his soul to the 
devil." 
Page 92: Yale prizes ''expensive clothes · 
and impeccable grooming and articulate

Page 102: Yale acts "above the rest of civ-
ilization . . . in that unreachable nether-
world." 
Page 197: Yale is "competitive, ambi-
tious, even ruthless when it comes to 
business." 
Page 39: Yale "wore khaki shorts and a 
navy fisherman's knit sweater."

Page 129: Yale is "a snob who only 
drank bottled water." 
Page 296: Yale is a "cold, uncaring son-
of-a-bitch." 
Page 231: Yale is "Mr. Wonderful." 
"Everything about Yale said class-and 
WASP," writes Fabio Lanzoni, in his adult 
novel, Dangerous. Though I'm embar-
rassed to be seen reading a book written by 
Fabio (a man whose fame is as inexplicable 
as his silky gold mane, an author whose 
prose is as intractable as his recovery from 
"facial reconstruction surgery" after he 
killed a seagull mid-roller-coaster ride), I 
can't help mysel£ I am in love with every 
sugarcoated syllable. 

Upon graduation (my well-thumbed 
copy of Dangerous hidden dangerously 
beneath my sweltering navy robe), I will 
imagine myself as Justine, who, unsatisfied 
and alone, shouts in a crowded bar, "To hell 
with Yale!" Or I will be Lexi, his deepest 
connection, and a woman mysterious 
enough to have won him over: "'I love you, 
Yale,' she said as he'd started the motor and 
pulled away." 

Yale is always driving off, always pulling 
away. He is arrogant, beautiful, distant, 
charming. He is eve 
· g we Ca.me here 
for. But he lets us down. He is a criminal. 
He takes advantage of women, only to cast 
them aside pages later. And most unloving 
of all, he cannot throw pebbles against my 
stained-glass window the night before finals, 
he cannot hold me· close on my common 
room futon: he is empty and cold and non-
existent. Yale Bradigan, despite his "sea-
foam eyes" and the way he "fills" his lovers 
with "molten pleasure," is nothing more 
than a copy of a copy of a copy. Though I 
pretend to know Yale, I know only a carica-
ture, an amalgamation of my hidden lust for 
cobbled courtyards, round wooden tables, 
Masters' teas and Sunday morning brunch-
es. 

Justine DiPerro, Yale's jealous fiancee, cap-
tures it all when she despairs, "This was 
ridiculous, this fantasizing about Yale." And 
by page 200, she realizes, broken-hearted, 
facing the mirror and watching the mascara 
run down her pallid face, "Yale loved only 
himsel£" 

Accusations fly. Yale falls from his pedestal. 
Peccadilloes with "arugula and capers" 
become fiery enough fodder for a Jerry 
Springer smack-down. Married Meredith 
screams at him from the tussled bed sheets, 
"You were using me, Yale ... for sex, because 
I was far more experienced than the college 
girls you were used to." Ah, le !igh, as I real-
ize that I, myself, am only a college girl. But 
then again, if Yale's not using women for 
th

she said, venom in her voice, 'that's all that 
ever mattered to you, isn't it, Yale?"'
