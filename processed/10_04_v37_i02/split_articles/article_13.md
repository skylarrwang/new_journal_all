FLANKED BY VACANT STOREFRONTS, the
upscale bohemian coffee house and bakery,
Kafe?, is jarringly out of place. With its
painted brick interior, and luxuriant leather
couches, Kafe? seems like an annex of
Koffee?, its Audubon counterpart. Only the
scarcity of customers distinguishes the new
coffee house from its bustling eleven-year-
old cousin. Not even the endless flow of cars
crossing the Grand Avenue bridge, which
divides Fair Haven and Fair Haven Heights,
brings life to Kafe?'s lonely sidewalk strip,
shared only with Ziggy's Pizza.

Although Duncan Goodall owns both
coffee houses and is negotiating the opening
of a third, he seems calm standing behind
Koffee?'s counter, handing change and
mochas to a flowing line of caffeine-addicts.
His phone rings and he dashes out the door,
mumbling something about needing to call

These coffee houses are Goodall's
"small screw in the wind" against the loss of
community the past decade has seen: Years

Revival of the American Community
and was deeply affected. He extracts the
phrase, "a life of desperate isolation'' to
describe what he sees as New Haven's
starved and dispersed community, in which
the workplace has failed to pull the neigh-
borhood together; people are slipping of
touch. Goodall, a strong proponent of new
urbanism, hopes Kafe? will help join Fair
Haven and Fair Haven Heights to create an
intermingled community .

Goodall got into the coffee house busi-
ness after he bought Koffee?
his favorite
college study place-from its original owners,
Lee and Tracy Johnson (who now own
KoffeeToo?). After graduating, he had no
intention of going into this line of work.
He fled New Haven to work with a consult-
ing company in Argentina. A few years later,
he moved back with his wife, to settle down
and run a business. Years later, he's expand-
ing. "One of the pieces I enjoy doing in a
coffee house like this is growing, building,
expanding," Goodall explains. "The day-to-
day stuff is not as exciting."

Koffee? feeds affluent East Rock resi-
dents their daily cookies and caffeine;
KoffeeToo? sits safely within the confines of
Yale, padded by studious coffee addicts who
need a place to work and mingle with
friends. Kafe? is on Grand Ave., directly
across the river from Fair Haven proper and
bordering Fair Haven Heights. Despite the
fact that Fair Haven is economically
depressed, Fair Haven Heights has become
the newest upscale neighborhood, attracting
young couples who cannot afford down-
town property prices. "These are my peo-
ple," Goodall notes. The 20-someihing Yale
grads are just the type to gravitate towards
an independent coffee shop for a daily latte
and cranberry scone.

The
predominantly
working-class
community in Fair Haven proper is perhaps
not as likely to indulge in three-dollar cups
of iced chai lattes. Goodall realizes this.
He's trying to bridge the gap by offering
lower-cost items, specifically less expensive
than Dunkin' Donuts, his competitor. Since
The New Journal


opening Kafe? in early September, Goodall
has circulated elaborate pro-con flyers com-
paring Kafe? to Dunkin' Donuts. To keep
up with the competition, Kafe? offers a
breakfast sandwich and cheap cup of joe,
while keeping the fancier coffees at the same
steep price of any other trendy cafe. He
admits that he really doesn't know if the
advertising has worked and probably won't
find out for a few more months. So far
Kafe? has doubled its sales within three
weeks of opening, and continues to grow.
Right now, Kafe? and Ziggy's Pizza are
the only two ,businesses on this run-down,
paint-chipped block. It's not very inviting.
But within the next year or so, Alex
Schiavone (daughter of Joel Schiavone) will
demolish the building, develop a new one
and contract other businesses, including a
high-end wine shop, a flower shop, a
gourmet deli, an upscale restaurant and an
Irish pub; Ziggy's may or may not stay. This
will be a similar transformation to Joel
Schiavone's work in downtown New Haven
during the '80s when the Ninth Square was
developed.
The Fair Haven community
seems
support
development.
Neighbors have poured in the doors of every
community meeting about the revamping,
which will create a commercial focal point
for the Fair Haven Heights and Fair Haven
Proper.
Right now, Goodall says he gets an
equal number of customers from both sides
of the river. "While Kafe? works to expand its
Fair Haven customer base, Goodall has
moved on to more growth and develop-
ment; he hopes to be signing a lease this
week
for
another
coffee
house
-Moka?
but won't reveal the potential
location. He's clearly excited about Moka?,
and if all goes as planned, he cia i ms Moka?
should get even more business than Koffee?.
Before heading back to work, wliere
customers have been streaming in all morn-
ing, Goodall adds, "It's a lot of fun." He
pauses, "It's like a big game of lemonade
stand but with a lot more varieties. I would-
n't want anything else."
