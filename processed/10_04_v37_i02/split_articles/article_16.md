uur. Wing's story is the official car-
bon marker at which the history of 
Yale's interaction with China begins. 
Yung Wing graduated from Yale in 1854 in 
a class of 98 students, becoming the first 
Asian to earn a degree (specifically a 
Bachelor of the Arts) from an American 
university. Rumor has it that he wore tradi-
tional Chinese robes and a coiffure of black 
braids to his first class. This was not the 
only way he made his mark. He survives as 
a symbol of Yale's storied history with 
China, a history that has recently taken on 
new urgency. 

Yale first became involved with China 
two decades prior to Wing's matriculation, 
in the 1830s, when it sent missionaries to 
the country "with a spirit that is loyal to the 
institution," says History Professor Beatrice 
Bartlett. In 2004, this spirit has not faded 
but transformed from its original incarna-
tion as an extension of the popular 
Christian gospel movement in the nine-
teenth century. Yale adopted this missionary 
spirit and made it its own 
setting sail with 
a broader purpose than proselytizing. To a 
18 
certain extent, this brand of "Yale spirit" 
dates back to Yale's founding in 1701. At . 
that time, the Yale spirit was simply a desire 
to do good works. It was a spirit of service. 
But it was only in the 1830s, when New 
Haven and Yale began to work together pro-
ductively, that the Yale spirit took on a 
broader purpose 
a desire to serve foreign 
nations, to bring them light and truth. 

This spirit brought Yung Wing to Yale, 
changing Yale's trajectory towards diversifi-
cation. In 1847, he sailed from Hong Kong 
with Reverend Samuel Robbins Brown, Yale 
College Class of 1829. Back in China, Wing 
had excelled at his studies, with a passion 
.. and ambition that set him apart. Reverend 
Brown noted this and arranged to bring him 
to the United States. When Wing landed on 
American shores, he immediately enrolled 
in Monson Academy, a private school in 
Massachusetts not far from the Connecticut 
border that still exists today. He boarded 
with Brown's own mother. Three years later, 
in 1850, Wing enrolled as a freshman in 
Yale College: "How I got in. I do not know, 
as I had had only 15 months of Latin and 
12 months of Greek, and ten months of 
mathematics," he exclaimed in a typical Yale 
student's dubiously ironic tone. 

He not 
only excelled in his studies but was also cre-
ating a lasting legacy as the only Asian in his 
class. 

In a speech entitled "Yellow in a White 
World," Harold Koh, Dean of the Yale Law 
School, lauded Wing as the "spiritual ances-
tor of every Asian that studies here today" 
and praised Wing's courage and academic 
fortitude, citing awards in English composi-
tion Wing won during his four years here. 
"We learned his story during our child-
hood," said one Chinese visiting scholar of 
the China Law Center at the Yale Law 
School. · 
Yung Wing would impact many chil-
dren during his lifetime 
directly and indi-
rectly. In 1872, he founded the Chinese 
Educational Mission, which sent Chinese 
youths to study as a part of a program based 
in Hartford, Connecticut. Yung Wing, a 
corporeal embodiment of the essence of 
"Yu"-:a Chinese character that represents 
"the nurturing of the intellect and spirit: the 
education of the young mind and cultiva-
tion of moral character"
