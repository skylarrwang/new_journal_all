Supermercado
WITH DIZZY'ING SCHEDULES and hours of
course work, it's hard for college students to
find time to save the world. Mercado
Glooal, a new Yale student-run organiza-
tion, has devised a synergistic solution
for the "I-would-be-but-I-have-no-time"
activist: Mercado sells handcrafts for low
prices and donates most of the profits to
Guatemalan non-governmental organiza-
tions.

burger sales by making them cheap and fast;

Mercado Global is a finely tuned business,
whose purpose is to channel money from
America to Guatemala. In fact, the Yale
Entrepreneurial Society (YES) honored
Mercado with a fifty-thousand dollar prize
for best Social Entrepreneurship business
plan in last year's "Y50K" competition. The

crux of Mercado's plan is its minimal over-
head, which creates an abundance of cash to
be sent to Guatemala. The best part of
Mercado's work, according to former mem-
ber Mattias Sparrow, "is that 80 percent of
our profits go back to Guatemala."

Beginning with the Y50K prize, the organi-
zation has been on what Sparrow calls, "a
winning trajectory." They went on to win
an Echoing Green fellowship to promote
social change in 2004, valued at $90,000.
With these awards Mercado has created an
inventory fund and is now beginning a
national sales campaign.
Volunteers are
being recruited at Brown, Columbia, NYU,
Harvard
and
potentially
Princeton.
Negotiations are underway with for-profit
corporations, such as World of Good, a
company that might be able to use
Mercado's image to improve its own.

is invested in actually selling the products.
How? Because no self-respecting college stu-
dent could say no to a new purse that also
cures social ills.

In fact, even this reporter could not
resist the allure of Mercado's product line.
The item was a frog keychain made entirely
of shiny plastic beads. It measured about an
inch and a half, and its purchase ran some-
thing like this:
"Hey that's cute. How much is
· this one?"
"Six dollars,"

"Remind me, what percentage of that is
going back to Guatemala?"
"Eighty."
"Let me go get my wallet."

The power of Mercado's well-con-
structed business plan is clear from . this
exchange. In fact,

a "fair trade" price. This price is set by the
Fair Trade Federation. A Guatemalan ship.;.
per agreed to assist Mercado by forwarding
all goods purchased in Guatemala to the
United States, free of charge.

When goods reach the U.S., Mercado
turns them over to college student volun-
teers who are in charge of sales. They set up
tables, hold events, and contact stores.
Public relations for Mercado is mostly
through flyers and word of mouth. Yale's
Mercado PR co-coordinator sports a
Guatemalan beaded necklace and speaks
about Mercado with a vibrancy equal to her
Guatemalan textile headband: "My job is
easy ... I made some flyers and that's pretty
much it." Consequently, very little m.oney
offers the oppor-
tunity for student
volunteers to be a
part of a successful ~usiness model; for stu-
dent purchasers to save the world, and for
everyone involved to still have time for that
problem set. Meanwhile, Guatemalans not
only get paid at a fair rate but also benefit
from the profits ofUS sales. The 80 percent
Mercado sends back to Guatemala helps run
an AIDS hospital and send girls to school.
"In one day we made enough to send 13
girls to school for one year," remarked Dain
Lewis, a Mercado staff member at the end
of a Cross Campus sale.
To clarify, he
added, "That's a result of marking the prices
up quite a bit."

Therein lies the beauty of Mercado
Global: it can cater simultaneously to both
the consumer culture of US colleges, and

the altruism also endemic to any campus.
Mercado is an impressive material success
that began with a focused business plan.
Lewis claims the next step is to expand the
countries that contribute to and benefit
from Mercado's sales. "Maybe Ecuador or
Peru," says Lewis. Soon, college students
can look forward to an even wider array of
goods guaranteed to save the world.
