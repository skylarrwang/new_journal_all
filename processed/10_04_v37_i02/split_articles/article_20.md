the first place, who fight their dogs and 
throw them out when they start losing. 

They come to the shelter looking for fresh 
blood, for fighters or bait-dogs. They ask for 
a pit, walk down the rows of cages, and 
point to the biggest, loudest dog who is 
throwing himself against the door, the one 
who has been in the shelter for months, the 
one that no one else will even look at. "I 
want that one," they say. They don't inquire 
about its history or ask to see how it walks 
on a leash. These people are asked to leave 
and not come back. And they don't, at least 
not during business hours. 

Last year the shelter had a rash of break-
ins and pit thefts. The staff believes local 
teens hopped t}le barbed-wire fences sur-
rounding the cages and somehow got the 
dogs back over with them. 

Of the eight that were 
stolen, a few were found 
roaming the streets, and 
one even came back to the 
shelter on his own. 

Life at the shelter is 
not ideal, but for many 
dogs it's a drastic improve-
ment. The volunteers take 
on a range of duties, 
including 
walking, 
grooming, and coordinat-
ing adoption events. Staff C 
and volunteers try to prep 
dogs 
for 
potential 
adopters, training them to walk on leashes 
and sit quietly beside their walkers. If I'm 
out back with a dog when a car pulls up, we 
stand like two orphans watching a wealthy 
young couple walk through the door. "Sit 
down, Annie," I say. "No one will take you 
if you keep barking like that." The couple 
approaches and I smile. "This is Annie. 
She's a three-year-old terrier mix" 
a euphemism for pit bull 
"who gets along 
well with children and other dogs." The 
woman smiles and edges behind her hus-
band, away from Annie, who's straining at 
her ·leash and drooling. "She's just a little 
excited," I continue. "She's normally very 
calm." After the couple thanks -me and 
walks away, Annie stops pulling and sits 
down beside me, panting. "You blew it, 
girl," I say. "You better shape up; you don't 
have much time left." 

October 2004 

A dog's chances for adoption diminish 
the longer it remains at the shelter. Dogs 
pass their days cooped up in cages sur-
rounded by other dogs who are also going 
crazy. The barking will make anyone's ears 
ring. The more stir-crazy a dog is, the less 
likely anyone is to consider him. 

The volunteers try to compensate for 
this by featuring the older dogs as "Pets of 
the Week." They post signs on their cages 
and on the shelter website, like this one for 
a small pit bull who lived at the shelter for 
six months: 
"My name is Hope. My previous owners 
were a bit neglectful of me and allowed my 
collar to become grown into my neck. So, if 
you come to see me you will notice right 
away that I have a boo-boo around my 
neck. It is healing quickly, I don't even real-
ize that it's there. It doesn't stop me, I'm 
energetic and bouncy. I love people, I love 
to jump on you and kiss you. Affectionate 
and very friendly. PLEASE HELP HER. 
SHE NEEDS TO GET OUT!" 

If the last line seems desperate, it's 
because it is. Shelter workers always fear a 
sudden influx of dogs who need cages that 
aren't available. If a dog has. been in the shel-
ter for a long time and is becoming increas-
ingly undesirable as a pet, he may be put 
down. "It's tough to keep them here too 
long, because their personalities change," 
said volunteer Darlene Koosa. "Scooby 
Doo, for example, he was here when I start-
ed training in May, and now there's defi-
nitely a change. He's more aggressive." 

Scooby Doo is the biggest pit at the 
shelter, as wide as he 'is tall, with one of the 
ugliest faces I've ever seen. This is why, a few 
weeks ago, I decided to take him for a walk. 
I'm trying to work on my shelter image; I'm 
pretty sure the other volunteers purposely 
take out all the big dogs before I ge~ there, 
· leaving me the puppies and miniature poo-
dle. So the other day I arrived early and 
went straight for Scooby's cage. The placard 
hanging on his door said, "Scooby may look 
tough, but he loves to give kisses and would 
make a great lap dog." I looked at him, 
drooling into a puddle between his front 
legs and denting_ the wire mesh door with 
his shoulder, and prepared his choke-chain. 
I crouched and positioned my body so I'd 
be blocking the opening of the cage. I 
unlatched the door but kept it closed with 
my knee, and held out the 
collar between my two 
hands like a eat's cradle. 
The moment I cracked 
open the door, Scooby 
shoved his head tl:trough the 
opening and was on his way 
to freeing his shoulders. I 
grabbed him wherever I 
could (his eye, I think) and 
tried to get his collar on. 
Bob was out on a run, so I 
was on my own. I was hav-
ing no luck with the collar, 
and he was almost com-
pletely out of the cage. In a 
moment of panic, I grabbed him with both 
hands by the scruff of the neck and hurled 
him back in the cage. My heart was pound-
ing, and I lo?ked down only to realize from 
the saliva running off my elbow that my 
forearm had been in his mouth during most 
of the five-minute scuffle, but there wasn't a 
single tooth-mark. 

Scooby reveals a lot about the plight of 
a shelter dog. No one wants him because 
he's strong and scary-looking. He's a 100-
pound dog trapped in a five by fifteen-foot 
cage, and he grows more stir-crazy every 
day. But in a desperate moment when most 
would have defended themselves against the 
girl with her fmger in their eye, Scooby only 
drooled.
