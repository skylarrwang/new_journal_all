Firing Squad 
"I COULDN'T PULL THE TRIGGER OF THE EMP'I1F.ST 
gun in the world, not if someone were looking 
down the barrel. One instinctively doesn't do 
it--<>ne can't," says the young Ursula in D.H. 
Lawrence's novel, Women in Love. The passage 
struck me when I read it. I had never touched 
a gun, but I'd always wondered what it would 
be like. Was Ursula right? Are some people 
simply instinctively unable to fire even an 
empty gun at another person? 

One snowy Thursday night, I went to a 
Yale Pistol Club practice at 'The Armory," a 
gray warehouse-like building that overlooks the 
athletic fields. The Armory was built in 1916 
as a US cavalry training center, and it seems 
very much a relic of an earlier time. Among 
old exposed piping and olive green army-issue 
lockers and tables, the Pistol Club meets most 
Tuesday and Thursday nights. 

Tonight, only three people have come to 
practice. One of them is Ricky Kamp, who 
got his Ph.D. from the School of Forestry and 
Environmental Studies in the early nineties. 
Ricky went to his first practice in 1989, and 
has been managing the club for more than 
a decade. When he first started shooting 
competitively, the club had a much larger 
membership. People came out as much to 
socialize as to shoot. These days, attendance is 
sporadic. Each new semester brings a handful 
of wide-eyed newcomers, people like me who 
want to see what it's like to shoot a gun. But 
they after they've satisfied their curiosity, they 
usually don't come back. 

Ricky talks me through the basics of how 
to load the pistol, how to aim it and how to 
stand. I'm surprised to learn that he holds 
the pistol with one hand, not two. I'm also 
surprised at how demanding it is to shoot. "You 
have error in your trigger release, error in your 
hand wobbling around, error in your elbow 
wobbling around, your shoulder, your feet, just 
on and on and on." Ricky tells me. He adds 
that my blood pressure, my blood sugar and 
how tired I am can have an enormous effect 
on how you shoot. Ricky tries to get a good 
night's rest, eat a high-protein meal and 
get to the range a few hours before 
he even picks up a gun. Both 
he and Barbara, a School of 
Nursing graduate who's been 
a member as long as Ricky, say 
they come to practice to relieve 
stress. But 
this seems 
strange: 
the 
process 
of 
shooting 
seems 
to 
require a degree of 
meticulousness 
that 
would make it impossible 
to release tension. They tell me 
it doesn't work that way. Shooting 
forces them to become calm and 
focused. "You should not be distracted 
by aggravating calls from the office. You 
shouldn't have things bothering you," says 
Ricky. A trip to the shooting range is less like 
a round on a punching bag and more like a 
form of meditation. 

Ricky blames the media's portrayal of 
firearms for the waning interest in the club. 
He and Barbara believe that none of the 
people with whom they shoot targets could 
ever shoot a person. "The criminal doesn't 
do it the way we do it," Barbara says. "We do 
it the right way. We buy [the gun] the right 
way, with a permit. And we handle it right." 
Ricky assures me, 'The people I know who 
are into shooting are the last people who 
would ever actually shoot anyone." 

For all their reassurances, I can't help 
thinking of the statistics so often advertised 
by gun control advocates; numbers showing 
that a gun kept 
in the home 
is22rimes 
more 
likely 
to be 
used 
in an 
unintentional 
shooting, 
criminal assault, 
homicide 
or 
attempted suicide 
than it is to be used 
in self defense. I 
am also reminded 
of the argument 
that anybody can 
be carried away by 
a state of mind: 
panic, extreme anger 
or extreme despair. 
These 
numbers 
suggest that when a 
gun is near, we can 
never be completely sure 
that we won't be compelled by forces within us 
but beyond our control, to pick it up and fire. 

Though they both have carrying permits, 
Ricky and Barbara keep their'pistols at the 
shooting range. They spare no caution when 
storing and handling their guns. The magazine, 
which holds the bullets, and the gun are kept 
separately in a locked case, which is stored in a 
large black safe, which is locked in a backroom 
off the main shooting range, nested away 
as safely as the innermost cloU of a Russian 
matryoshka .. 

Before he hands me the pistol, a .22 
caliber semiautomatic handgun, he checks 
to make sure the magazine is removed and 
the chamber is empty. Then he checks again. 
Then he shows me how to check for myself. 
There is absolutely no chance the gun contains 
a bullet. Nevertheless, when I take the gun 
from Ricky's hand, the other two members 
shift back slightly. 

Standing in my booth wearing goggles 
and ear protectors, I feel removed from reality. 
I stare through the sights to the bulls-eye hung 
up fifty feet away, and I'm astonished at how 
hard it is to keep my aim steady. Ricky tells 
me I should put my left hand in my pocket 
to anchor my body, which will give me more 
accuracy. He also tells me I shouldn't even 
think of the phrase "pulling the trigger," 
because simply imagining an action like pulling 
throws off the gun's equilibrium. Instead, he 
tells me to think of very gradually applying 
more and more pressure to the trigger. If I'm 
doing it right, I shouldn't even know when the 
pistol will actually fire. The idea goes against 
my most emblazoned notion of shooting a 
gun. Instead of being at my most powerful, 
when I pull the trigger, or rather when the gun 
is fired, I am at my most passive. 

I get into position and try to clear my 
mind. I stand still, applying gradual pressure 
to the trigger with my index finger, and I wait. 
And then the bullet is fired. Immediately, a 
small black hole appears in the paper target, 
just beyond the outermost ring. Because the 
gun is small, the kickback isn't the powerful jolt 
I expected. It felt as if the gun was attached to 
a taut string, and the string was suddenly cut; 
or as if the gun was, for the briefest moment, 
freed from gravity. My next few shots hit closer 
to the bulls-eye. And then I start shooting 
wide. To remedy this, Ricky hangs up a plain 
piece of paper and tells me not to worry about 
trying to hit a target. It works-the blank 
white paper clears my mind. It seems, as they 
say, a little Zen. 

After I'm done, Ricky lets me walk over to 
the back wall of the range, first checking and 
double-checking that every gun is unloaded 
and everyone is out of their stalls. The shells at 
the front of the range crunch like empty husks 
under our shoes. The targets are hung up in

front of a canvas curtain. Behind the curtain 
a thick steel backstop hangs at a forty-five 
degree angle. Traveling at about a thousand 
feet per second, the bullets nearly liquefy when 
they hit the backstop. Underneath, instead of 
spent cartridges, there are deep drifts of what 
looks like silver sawdust--all that remains of 
the lead bullets. Seeing this, I remember just 
how powerful a gun actually is. 

According to Ricky, none of the members 
use the safeties on their guns when they 
practice. It helps them avoid what he calls 
a dangerous gray area. "You're either ready 
to shoot, or you're not shooting. There's no 
middle ground." 

I wonder for how many 
other places this is true. 
Outside of the 
painstaking precautions and the quiet isolation 
of the Pistol Club, can the gray area really be 
eliminated? 

At the end of the night, we all dismantle 
our pistols. 
We slide out the magazines, 
remove the bullets, check the chambers and 
shut the guns inside their cases. Ricky closes 
the iron safe and the backroom door, and we 
file out into the snow while Ricky locks the 
shooting range behind us.
