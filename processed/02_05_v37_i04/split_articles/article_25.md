T YALE YOU CAN STUDY ZOOLOGY, use a zymoscope, research 
Zwinglianism and hang out at Zeta Psi. You can even meet a 
Zoroastrian! Although Zoroastrians don't sponsor dances, put 
full page ads in the YDN advertising the tenets of their religion or even 
have an organized group. Zoroastrianism doesn't have a low profile at 
Yale just because of its small following. The reason for its obscurity is 
more complex. 

When I first met Yale College's sole Zoroastrian, Nazneen Mehta, 
I assumed she would be bristling with ideas about how to give her 
religion a larger presence on campus, or how, at the very 
least, it could be recognized. Given its distinction 
as the world's first monotheistic religion 
and its huge influence on other faiths, 
Zoroastrianism seems to have a claim 
for integration into Yale's religious 
scene, even if Mehta is one of two 
Zoroastrians here. 

But Mehta, who describes 
herself as "deeply religious," 
is perfectly happy being a 
minority with no support 
or recognition from her 
University. Even if Yale were 
teeming with Zoroastrians, 
Mehta 
can't 
think 
of 
anything they would ask of 
the University. 

Zoroastrianism, as I came 
to learn, is both a faith and 
an 
intellectual 
discipline. 
The religion emphasizes free 
will 
and demands rigorous 
examination of one's actions 
to 
determine 
whether 
they 
accord with good or with evil. 
Zoroastrianism emphasizes moral 
action and personal responsibility much 
more heavily than doctrine or outward 
signs of piety. While it would be nice to be 
able to meet other Zoroastrians, Mehta says, 
their presence at Yale would not affect how she 
practices her religion. 

This is not a public religion: in fact, conversion is impossible--one 
must be born a Zoroastrian to be a Zoroastrian-and, according to 
Mehta, Zoroastrians do not require the sort of "group therapy" that 
is a significant draw of many of Yale's religious groups: "While there's 
merit in groups and safe places for discussion and development," 
Mehta says, "I don't need a space or a club but simply other people's 
understanding and respect of my way of life." But doesn't every Yalie 
want a club? Mehta was adamant the intensely personal and intellectual 
. 38 
by Jamie Martin 
focus of her religion makes it irrelevant whether or not any Zoroastrian 
groups exist here. 

Avisa Demehri, the other Zoroastrian on campus, confirmed 
Mehta's synopsis. Demehri, a graduate student in Yale's School of 
Epidemiology & Public Health and an Iranian Zoroastrian, had virtually 
the same answers to my questions and had no idea another Zoroastrian 
even existed on campus. Demehri has not had Zoroastrian friends since 
moving to the United States. When people learn she's from Iran, she 
doesn't even bother to dispel their assumptions that she is Muslim. 

But, she told me, it's not difficult to be the only Zoroastrian 
she knows. Nor is there anything that could be done at 
Yale to make her life easier as a Zoroastrian-no 
organization, sacred space, magazine, or website 
would make any difference at all. The only 
thing that might help, she admitted, would be 
a course at Yale about Zoroastrianism that 
would teach others that an Iranian need not 
be a Muslim, nor an Indian be a Hindu. 

Professor Stanley Insler, a philologist 
and expert on Sanskrit, Ancient Persian, 
and Avesta, the holy language of 
Zoroastrianism, 
has in fact 
taught 
courses here at Yale on Zoroastrianism. 
'There really should be more classes 
on Zoroastrianism at Yale," he said. 
"It is probably the oldest living faith 
in the world [and it] has been seminal 
for the intellectual history of the 
world." It is crucial, he explained, that 
religious people--particularly Jews and 
Christians-understand 
the 
history 
of their religion and the influence 
Zoroastrianism has had on it. Most 
Christians, he remarked, are completely 
unaware of the fact that their conceptions 
of heaven and hell have been heavily 
influenced by Zoroastrian metaphysics. 

Apart from offering classes about the 
ancient faith, what else could ¥ale do for its 
Zoroastrian population? Professor Insler looked at me 
incredulously when I asked this question: "Zoroastrians have 
a sacred space in their fire temples, where they pray. But because 
Zarathustra wanted his followers to actively fight against evil in the 
world, he equally considered the world as the larger 'sacred space' in 
which believers should practice their religion of truth tlu:ough good 
thoughts, good words and good deeds. Zoroastrianism is a religion of 
action. The real ritual ground is the whole world."
