"A Turner" 
by John Anderson 
You won't find these drawings in museums. They're not hanging grandly 
in the library court or packed tightly into dark boxes in the Prints and 
Drawings Department. They are filed as phone conversations, ideas 
that were never realized, doodles on a yellow legal pad. 

About once a month someone calls the center because they've just 
found a drawing by J.M.W. Turner. It came from their grandmother's 
attic, from the flea market down the street. Their voices quake in 
anticipation! They are heady with their attic find! It says "Turner" right 
on the back! 

Wilcox is on the other end of the line, because another part of his 
job, besides touring England for paintings or planning shows years in 
advance, is handling the misinformed. "Are there any penciled arrows 
on the drawing?" he'll ask a caller, rolling his eyes and doodling absent-
mindedly on a legal pad. "Is there a plaque on the back of the frame 
with the name 'John Anderson'?" Yes, they'll reply. Yes. Yes. Yes. 
"Well," Wilcox sighs, preparing to repeat the speech he gives 
monthly. "What you've got there is a fake. It's not really a Turner. 
It's a John Anderson 'Turner.'" Then he tells them a little story: John 
Anderson is dead now, but one hundred years ago he traveled the 
British countryside buying up amateur drawings which he claimed to 
be the works of J.M.W. Turner. Anderson professed to believe the 
drawings contained hidden Turner signatures and he penciled in arrows 
to help people find them. "I'm not sure the extent to which Anderson 
saw it as a genius scheme or whether he actually succeeded in deluding 
himself," Wilcox chuckles. Anderson sold his "Turners" to the only 
outlet that would accept them: department stores. Today, the fakes 
circulate through hundreds of attics and flea markets to be dug up by 
the next generation of starry-eyed sleuths, who, ten years down the 
road, will telephone Wilcox to ask again.

"Steamboat in a Storm" 
Anonymous. 
Ten years ago, a New York couple called up with another Turner 
watercolor. A jaded Wilcox employed the same set of questions, but 
the couple who had called couldn't find any pencil marks and there 
certainly wasn't the Anderson plate on the back. Could this really be a 
Turner? When the clients sent the department a set of photographs of 
their watercolor, Wilcox was "flabbergasted .... It was exactly the same 
as the Turner in our collection," he spouted. The curators looked at the 
photograph alongside their original "Steamboat in a Storm," from 1851. 
How could it be? "We joked about how he could have snuck in and 
photographed it, but also along with that discussion, we talked about 
how ridiculous that would be. Really, it was a matter of coincidence." 

With "a little digging around," Wilcox found that the original Turner 
had been in the collection of John Ruskin and that a student of Ruskin's 
had copied the Turner watercolor to the last flawless brushstroke as an 
exercise. Gleeful with his findings, Wilcox called the New Yorkers back 
with the exciting news and invited them to bring their watercolor over 
to compare the twin works side by side. The museum even expressed an 
interest in acquiring the copy for educational purposes. Wilcox wanted 
to see the works side by side, but the owners of the other painting never

replied. "They were probably so pissed that it wasn't an actual Turner, 
that they had asked us at all," Wilcox said briskly.

"Mountain Scene in Wales " 
by Thomas Girtin 
"There was a perfect Girtin painting," Wilcox begins, "called 'Mountain 
Scene in Wales .' And all the British museums had refused the asking 
price, which was far too high." If he stresses this step in the process, 
it is because if a work is deemed "culturally significant" by British 
authorities, it can be shipped to a seller overseas only when all national 
buyers cannot afford it. Only then does the sale receive an "export 
license," a word that makes the curators here cringe. 

Though the museum craved the painting, they simply could not 
afford it, Wilcox says: "We also refused the asking price, and made an 
offer of less than half the original price." The seller on the other end 
of the line pretended to be appalled, but eventually returned Wilcox's 
call. "I remember our old director was practically cracking out the 
champagne. But our export license was stopped. At the new, lower 
price, other museums could match the bid." 

It's difficult to be a British museum outside of Britain . It's a very 
strange situation really, because when Wilcox thinks how bad he wanted 
that painting, and thinks of where it ended up, he can't feel angry. "It's 
hanging on the wall at the National Museum of Wales," where, Wilcox 
shrugs, "I suppose it belongs."

When I first ambled through the British Arts Center , I didn't know any 
of this. It was just a museum, and the paintings were just pictures on 
the wall. It was my first year at Yale and it was winter and the sky was 
cold and empty. I had come with a friend, and together we toured the 
entire museum. 

The room we saved for last contained a Turner. I paused and 
studied it. I didn't really know who Turner was. This work showed a sky 
sloshing about, mixing and swirling together. I didn't know anything 
about the painting, or how it had gotten here, or who had owned 
it before. I only knew that it had ended up here because it was just 
beautiful. 

"Hey, look at this," my friend prodded, calling me away. Three feet 
to my right, a plate-glass window stretched from the floor to the ceiling, 
overlooking the intersection outside the museum. It was snowing, 
everything mixing and swirling together. It was the first snow, and its 
whiteness hid the sooty street entirely. There was no story behind it. 
It was just beautiful. Everything in the street was white, like paper, 
exactly as the world in the painting.

LIKE MANY of the illicit love affairs that 
happen at Yale, my relationship with 
Connecticut Post Mall began one night 
at Toad's Place. Or, more precisely, behind 
Toad's, on a bench where I had sought refuge 
from the blistering winter winds. That night 
marked the first true snowfall of the season, 
and I, a naive freshman transplant from 
Arizona, had been caught woefully unprepared 
in my light tweed jacket. Overwhelmed by 
cold and exhaustion on the walk to Stiles, I 
collapsed into a heap of tears, frozen soot, 
and scantily covered limbs. As I trembled and 
curled my numb toes into my strappy heels, 
I murmured to myself two affirmations: one, 
Connecticut was by far the worst state I had 
ever lived in (and, as a former military brat, 
I've lived in quite a few), and two, I needed to 
buy a real coat. 

At the time, however, Trailblazer was 
still daunting to my "West Coast" sensibility 
(What is this "North Face?" I often wondered 
amid a sea of fleeces), and Urban Outfitters 
had already failed me with its prioritizing 
of flower appliques and "vintage" (read: 
threadbare) fabrics over actual warmth. I had 
heard vague references to a nearby mall, but 
I didn't know anyone who had actually ever 
been to Connecticut Post, or anyone with 
a car. 

Two days, a hunt for a bus schedule, 
and a cashed check later, I climbed aboard 
a blue CT-Transit bus on the corner of 
Temple and Elm, "J-7 Milford" flashing 
on the front of the bus in tiny lights. 
I sat in the front seat---a spot which, 
according to the sign posted above, I 
would have to relinquish to the elderly 
or disabled---and primly clutched my 
purse, scanning the bus for fellow 
Yalies. None present. 

"This route ends at Connecticut 
Post Mall, right?" I asked the driver. I 
felt like I was being escorted to a blind 
date. 

"Bingo," he said, yanking the 
door lever. An hour later, I stepped 
off the bus and faced my destination. 
It was hardly love at first sight. The 
entrance was like a prison door, 
industrial gray and beige. A fat toddler 
with chocolate smeared on his cheeks 
waddled out of the door, and a lonely 
plastic shopping bag flew toward me 
like tumbleweed. I shivered. 

I stalled for a few minutes and then I 
breached the doors. Almost instantly, I was 
overwhelmed by a familiar sense of calm. On 
that initial journey, I purchased a coat, a pair 
of gloves, and a Christmas present for my 
aunt. Two weeks later, I was back on the bus 
with the gloves and the receipt to exchange 
them. The following week I returned again, 
and before I knew it, the occasional outing had 
evolved into a habit. Eventually, my presence 
on the J-7 was routine enough to merit nods 
from the other regulars. 

From the outset, I knew that one of the 
reasons the mall appealed to me so intensely 
was its ability to provide anonymity. At Yale, 
one loses the ability to walk down a crowded 
street without being assailed by a barrage of 
smiles, greetings, and brief conversations. 
While the omnipresence of familiar faces can 
be pleasant, it can also be something 
undeniably liberating about 
being among a mass of complete strangers. 

Inside Connecticut Post's automatic doors, 
I liked to perch on the benches and people-
watch, or wander through Sears while busy 
shoppers swarmed around me. Poss√©s of 
Abercrombie-clad high school girls eyed me 
cattily, thugged-out pre-teens toting Foot 
Locker bags swaggered by my bench, genteel 
old men asked me for the time, and I loved 
it. Fleeting, unlikely interactions between 
strangers abound at the mall, and I sought 
them out voraciously. 

I began to depend on CT Post as a sort of 
fix, or a break from the real world. At the time, 
I couldn't rationalize my habit; the anonymity 
was nice, but I could have easily found it at 
other places. Something about the mall was 
strangely and inexplicably addictive, like 
the overpowering smell of gasoline. As any 
couple's therapist can tell you, however, a 
relationship based on reliance can veer down 
one of two paths: stable commitment, 
and paranoia. Progressively, my 
attachment grew to resemble the 
attraction-like and I
