community could have @ed for convening status, but that "the window 
of opportunity had closed" and the consent order would not include 
the Newhall Coalition in any capacity. "I was livid!" Hayes exclaimed. 


At that point it seemed all the community's efforts were futile, and 
they would have to rely on the authority of the DEP to promote their 
interests, which it had failed to do in the past. "So we decided to get 
legaL No one will listen to you until you get legal," Hayes, but that 
point a veteran activist, says knowingly." Hayes contacted seven firms, 
all outside of Connecticut, and decided to hire Mark Roberts, a Boston 
attorney with experience in representing communities in environmental 
lawsuits. In May 2003, a suit was @ed against the town and state, 
claiming the Newhall community was unrepresented in the remediation 
process and that the residents were given no way to formally address 
their concerns to the DEP. Over one hundred residents signed on to 
the suit, representing over one third of the homes in Newhall. 


The media ate up the story and word of the lawsuit spread quickly, 
attracting environmental activists across the country, including the 
legendary Lois Gibbs, of the famed Love Canal case. Gibbs visited 
Newhall in November 2003 and spoke in support of the Newhall 
Coalition and their battle against the DEP and Olin Corporation. 


While the immediate health risk to Hamden residents may not have 
been as dire as those in Love Canal in the 1970s, Gibbs drew striking 
comparisons between the two communities and urged Elizabeth and 
others to continue challenging the standards of the DEP. "It was a huge 
inspiration to have Lois come here," said Hayes. "The DEP didn't like 
it at all because of the publicity, but we had been struggling through 
frustrating times and she gave us the motivation and hope to keep 
16 
moving forward." 


And there was plenty to cause frustration. A timeline was 
established that set 2006 as the target date for the remediation. But 
in recent meetings, the DEP has projected it may not be until 2008 
before Newhall is cleaned up. Questions were raised about the DEP's 
conflict of interest for delay. ''You want to talk about conflicts of 
interest; you should look at where the DEP gets its money!" Hayes says. 
"Olin Corporation is giving the DEP money for the cleanup, but the 
DEP is supposed to be protecting us from companies like Olin. Who's 
watching the watchdog?" 


Newhall residents were also concerned about the fate of their 
neighborhood if the middle school is relocated. With property values 
dropping, the community runs the risk of heading into a period of 
decay. When the school moves, residents fear Newhall will be become a 
ghost town, not attracting any new families or businesses. "Having the 
middle school here is a great asset to Newhall because it makes people 
look around and notice us." 


T
HE MOST RECENT PUBUC MEETING of the Newhall Coalition in 
December, which Hayes presided over, included updates from 
their lawyer, Mark Roberts, and Jay Rasku, a representative from 
the TAC. Olin had just finished putting four inches of topsoil over ten 
of the designated "hotspots." But, Henry Blue, an outspoken old-timer 
of the NAC, delivered a speech about why he had refused to allow Olin 
to cover up his property with the topsoil, vehemently declaring that he 
believed in doing a job right the first time. He was unwilling to let Olin 
get away with such a quick 6x. Mark Roberts spoke next, presenting 


the latest developments in the investigation phase of the remediation 
project, doing his best to defend the capping process derided by Blue. 


When Roberts mentioned that cleanup may be pushed back to 2008, 
Hayes glared at him from her front-row seat at, but he seemed not to 
notice. One resident asked if he knew where Olin would put the waste 
once it had been removed from their properties. 


At one point, there had been discussion of dumping the 
contaminated soil in one of the fields behind the middle school, but a 
substantial outcry put an end to that discussion. 'We don't know yet. 
Probably a hazardous waste site somewhere," Robert's responded. "I 
say we dump it in the mayor's house," someone responded in a low 
voice to quiet cheers and giggles. 


Other residents spoke up about tax abatement, health concerns, 
the most recent timeline for cleanup, and the technical aspects of the 
lawsuit. Rasku and Blue both urged more neighbors to join the suit, 
and one woman invited others to join her in attending meetings at City 
Hall: ''If they won't come to us, then we will go to them. We pay taXes, .. 
and if they are representing us then they need to hear our voices." 


Hayes later characterized the meeting as a tame one, insinuating Aying 
insults and harsh words exchanged on former occasions, but were 
impressive enough. The small, individual efforts of these citizens to 
demand acknowledgement, which have added up to a substantial force 
for the town and state to reckon with 


L
ooking back on that first discussion with the town building 
official in 1996, Hayes shakes her head. ''I had no idea what was 
going on. If I had only known ... " Her voice trails off, but she is 
February 2005 
smiling. Despite the setbacks, she is hopeful that the Newhall Coalition's 
work is making a difference. She recently attended an EPA conference 
in Washington, D C, where she met a professor from John's Hopkins 
University who has joined her cadre. Students at the Environment21 
Resource Institute at Storrs University are now also working with the 
Coalition, and Elizabeth keeps a pile o f informational handouts in the 
office to give to anyone who is interested in the technical aspects o f the 
remediation. "This is my way of giving back to the community," she 
says. "I have learned how to become my own advocate, and information 
is the key. I want to share that with every person in this neighborhood, 
and maybe someday they will all want to know." She shares a story 
of an 85-year-old woman who approached her a few months ago and 
said, "Baby, when will all this be over? I've got to get on with my life." 
Elizabeth has made a promise to her neighbor: "2006;' she says. She 
only hopes she can keep it.
