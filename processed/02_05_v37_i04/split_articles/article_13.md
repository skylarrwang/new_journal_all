the Arabian-Nighcs-enthusiast tucked between 
Hull's art supplies and Thai Pan Asian, but 
there it is: one of "belly dancing costumes and 
accessories" -Casablanca. 

Sixteen years of collecting merchandise 
has led to a store full of exotic knick-knacks 
including hand-woven camel saddle bags, 
head wraps and a full-body costume from 
Gandia. In auctions and open-air markets the 
merchandise has been gathered from the four 
comers of the world and then jammed into 
this little store on Chapel stteet. 

Surprisingly, in this cultural concoction 
ordinary jeans hang alongside silky pantaloons. 
The jeans are not the only artifacts of 
American life at Casablanca: NPR's All Thi11gs 
Con.tidtrtd fuses with the incense. The scattered 
evidence of American culture in this shop, 
from blue jeans to Bogart, lends the place an 
air of parody. The overseer of this unusual 
collection, the maharaja himself, stands behind 
a counter plastered with pictures of Morocco, 
smoking a cigarette, wearing a black beret and 
thin silver glasses, staring shrewdly at passers 
by and customers alike. 

Twenty-four years ago, Alouah Lachem 
emigrated to the States from Morocco with 
his pregnant wife in order to take care of his 
stepfather. The responsibilities of his store 
and his daughter made returning to Morocco 
impossible. Though Lachem left behind Uriga, 
his birthplace in the Atlas Mountains, he still 
owns "an ancient house," an heirloom built by 
his great grandfather. "The walls arc this big," 
he gestures emphatically with his hands. When 
he dies, he says, his daughter will inherit the 
house, though it is unclear what an ,American 
who has never lived in Morocco will do with 
such a place. 

According to Lachem, his life in the Atlas 
Mountains was a mix of blissful and intellectual 
pursuits. Fluent in five languages, Lachem 
used his linguistic expertise to translate four 
film writers. He translated native languages 
to English and vice versa. He intended this 
only as a part time job, a means of earning 
extra cash during school, but interpreting 
was addictive: with each film, Lachem began 
to build a reputation, successively working 
with more prominent filmmakers. On the 
wall behind the counter hangs a p1cture 
of a younger Lachem standing in a desert 
surrounded by filmographers and reels of 
tapes. "That's me with the big Afro," he says. 

Exhilarated, he recalls his work with Michael 
Caine on The Man IV'ho Wo111d Be King. Hidden 
in a bohemian mecca on Chapel Street, a 'New 
Haven shop-owner has rubbed elbows with 
legendary heroes. 

This 
beret-wearing 
movie 
translator 
has also dabbled in fashion design. "John's 
on Whitney Ave used to sell my clothes," he 
says, gesturing south. "Especially during the 
'70s, they were popular." Lachcm still displays 
designer duds from his fashion show days, 
and some of his items appeared at a Coliseum 
show five years ago. 

The mysterious aura of Casablanca might 
give the impression that Lachem 
is not concerned with ordinary 
necessities. But his tailoring business 
proves the contrary: Alouah Lachem is 
a shrewd businessman. His shop may 
be a fantastical, but his sewing machine 
grinds out a profitable, realistic life. 

Lachem tailors for local stores such as J. 
Crew and Ragg's. "Have you ever bought 
something from J. Crew?" he inquires. "I 
tailor for J. Crew. If you ever got tailored 
at J. Crew, l probably did your clothes." 

Lachem IS a man of contradictions. 
Not only does his enigmatic air collide with 
his practicality, but his politics are similarly 
confusing. Ask Lachem his opinion on political 
affairs and he will claim to be "independent" 
or uninvolved. There is an uncontrollable 
excitement m his eyes when he speaks about 
Moroccan-US relations. (He even pulls out 
a laminated "Treaty of Peace & Friendship" 
between the U.S. and Morocco signed 
in 
1787.) His 24 years here have neither erased 
nor dimmed his Moroccan nationalism. Twice 
a year he travels to Morocco to acquire more 
artifacts for h1s store, but the journeys seem 
more like pilgrimages to his past than business 
trips. When asked about his roots, he replies 
ina fierce correctional tone, "I am descended 
from the Berbers, not the Arabs ... We are the 
people who kept Spain free of England." Still, 
Lachem insistS, "This is my second home," 
while in the same breath, making sure to 
identify the jeans as manufactured in France, 
not the U.S. 

This instinct to assert his identity, to avoid 
getting 
lost in mainstream America, 
epitomizes Casablanca, a queer little boutique 
whose identity is Less wrapped up in a successful 
business model than a collection of odds and 
ends. Lachem's most practical item on sale is 
a set of purses from Ghana with peace signs 
woven on them, sold at a price certain to 
frighten most buyers. He refuctandy admitS 
that his business intentions are not solely for 
the almighty dollar, but to indulge his artistic 
whims. 

Hanging from the ceiling, a hairy Tanzanian 
mask with peacock feathers splayed on the 
top stares unapologetically .at onlookers. This 
jarring face reveals a world beyond America, 
far beyond commercialism and into the heart 
of the wild and magical In response to his
