Wisecrack 
IN JOSEPH C. 
PAULDING's 19"' 
century 
humorous tale, "Jonathan Visits the Celestial 
Empire," the eponymous Yankee sails around 
the world selling ginseng, accompanied by 
his co-captain, a Newfoundland dog. Our 
hero boasts an adventurous entrepreneurial 
spirit. One might say the same of Jonathan's 
contemporary publicist, Professor David E. 
E. Sloane, who has written about Paulding 
and revived his tale from wasting away on 
dusty bookshelves. Dr. Sloane is a professor 
of English and Applied Linguistics at the 
University of New Haven (UNH), where he 
teaches primarily online classes, disseminating 
knowledge about 19m century American 
humor writing, Mark Twain, Thomas Edison, 
adverbial clauses and fashionable hats. 

Dr. Sloane is tall and formally-dressed, 
but his mustached, mischievous grin removes 
any air of pretense. He chats easily and affably, 
blending Twain jokes and his own one-liners 
naturally into conversation. His humor has 
served him well in his many public roles, 
which have included editing Country Dance 
and Song, directing the American Humor 
Studies Association and presiding over the Eli 
Whitney Museum and the Mark Twain Circle. 

Since graduating from high school, Dr. Sloane 
has secured many prestigious degrees. All the 
while he acquired a love of the banjo, rescued 
many 19th century humorists from obscurity 
and developed a strong social conscience. 

Dr. Sloane's particular interest in Mark 
Twain burgeoned in high school, when he 
wrote a book report on Innocents Abroad for 
which he received a "C" for content and an 
"F" for grammar/writing. No longer ignorant 
of effective writing technique, Dr. Sloane has 
since penned seven scholarly books on Mark 
Twain and American humor. He explains 
that Twain's humor is rooted in a critique of 
social problems that persist today, particularly 
racism. As Dr. Sloane points out, "We're living 
out Huck Finn now in New Haven." 

The professor's knowledge about the 
elements of style extends beyond strong 
writing skills: Dr. Sloane almost always sports 
a Bogle-esque fedora. Occasional breaks from 
the fedora come in online clips of the professor 
"lecturing" on the UNH classes server. Each 
clip finds the distinguished scholar wearing a 
different hat and cradling his beloved banjo, 
on which he strums a lecture-sing-along. In 
one clip, he sings prepositions to the tune 
of "Yankee Doodle," while another clip 
concludes with the straight-faced professor 
pausing, then offering the non-sequitor, "So 
now the future of American youth belongs 
to you." In a third clip, the professor dons a 
severely frayed sombrero as he discourses on 
the rules of grammar over an Irish jig jangling 
in the background. And in yet another clip, Dr. 
Sloane smiles out from under a plastic "New 
Year's Eve" top hat and belts out the last few 
bars of "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"

runs of 
American 
humor 
magazines from the 
mid-19th to mid-20th 
century, 
with 
names 
such 
as 
"Hot 
Dog," 
"Ballyhoo" and "Sagebrush 
Philosophy." As evidence 
of the Yankee 
ingenuity 
and thriftiness that he shares 
with his favorite writers 
their subjects, Dr. Sloane salvaged a 
"derelict barbershop next to a biker bar" 
and turned it into his office. In addition, he 
hopes to someday live his dream of opening 
an antique shop, and in so doing earn more 
than accolades and prestige for his love and 
knowledge of old Americana. 

And there is the possible commercial 
success of Dr. Sloane's upcoming book on 
Edison's daughter. His subject, Madeleine 
Sloane, was in fact Dr. Sloane's paternal 
grandmother (the second "E" of Sloane's 
four initials stands for "Edison"). From his 
ancestors, the scholar inherited not only the 
inventive impulse, but also hundreds of love 
letters he has been preserving in water-stained 
cardboard boxes. This inheritance cannot 
compensate for Edison's disinheritance of his 
own daughter when she married a Catholic 
against her father's wishes, but perhaps Dr. 
Sloane's forthcoming book, which will draw 
heavily from her love letters, will rescue 
Madeleine from anonymity. 

Dr. Sloane has his own sidekick-not 
a Newfoundland dog but a seven-month-
old poodle named Challah. Dr. Sloane's four 
children were contracted as Challah's original 
caretakers but their father has assumed care 
of the poodle with tempered equanimity. 
Dr. Sloane grumbles in jest, "The poodle 
doesn't know he's walking in front of a full 
professor." 

Like Mark Twain, Dr. Sloane 
is deeply devoted to family (past 
present), 
literature and humor. Dr. 
Sloane is a modern-day 
Connecticut Yankee courting 
financial fortune and exercising 
pedagogical, 
scholarly, 
fatherly influence. Hot 
dog!
