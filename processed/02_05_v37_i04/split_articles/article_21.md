"A Comparative Anatomical Ex-
position of a Human Body with 
that of a Tiger and a 
Common 
Fowl." 
By George Stubbs 
Flip past the first four 
drawings. 
There. 
Right 
there. These are the last 
works 
ever 
drawn 
by 
George Stubbs. There is a 
tiger crawling elegantly and 
a man, his sinews splayed 
for view. In 1795, Stubbs 
was 71-years-old. He was 
already a prominent painter 
of horses, but he wanted to 
try something different. He 
was an anatomist by trade 
and his last drawings show 
it. What you see comprised 
his 
final 
treatise, 
"A 
Comparative 
Anatomical 
Exposition of a Human 
Body with that of a Tiger 
and a Common Fowl." 

Look at how the tiger 
resembles the man. Look 
at how the man bends like 
the tiger. Stubbs drew these 
to show people that there is 
an innate, shared structure 
between all living things. 

After his death, Stubbs' 
wife sold the drawings, 
which 
changed 
hands 
several times and traveled 
the world for the better 
part of the next century, 
until 
1863 
when 
they 
landed in the Worcester, 
cr Free Public l.Jbrary. 
106 years later, in 1957, 
a Worcester librarian busied herself with a 
vast re-cataloguing project. She uncovered 
the original drawings, penciled by Stubbs. 
But what was the library to do with a lot of 
famous drawings? The Worcester Free Library 
didn't have a way to restore them or keep the 
valuable artWorks safe. 

Enter Paul Mellon. In 1980, the Yale 
millionaire 
bought 
the 
drawings 
from 
Worcester to dorute to his pet project, the 
Yale Center for British Art (YCBA). Mellon 
was pushing a great deal of money toward the 
new building, which would become a cathedraJ 
to his vast collection of British works. An avid 
equestrian, Mr. Mellon was obsessed with 
Stubbs. He left the library $1.25 million for the 
horse painter's final drawings.

Though the town of \Vorcester could 
never ha,·e dreamt of. being offered such a 
sum, the people of Worcester agreed the town 
shouJdn't take it. "We feel that the art was 
given to the city and it belongs to the citizens 
of the city," wrote Joan Gallant in an angry 
Worcester Sun~ T~ltgram column vehemently 
titled, "Money in the bank, Drawings in 
Boxes, and neither can be touched." A letter 
to the editor a week later ran the headline 
"Sale of Stubbs Drawings is Unfortunate," 
and professed that the donor's will had "been 
betrayed." By leaving the artworks to a public 
library, the townspeople felt that Dr. Green had 
wanted the drawings to be easily accessible tb 
Worcester citizens. Instead, some out-of-town 
millionaire rolled in to snatch them up and catt 
them away. The town lobbied 
against the sale, even forming 
a committee called, "Save-Our-
Stubbs," which hoped to raise 
enough money to take Mellon to 
court. It never happened. 

The citizens who spoke 'tO 
save these pieces didn't know 
their value until after they were 
purchased. And how could tHey 
have? Andrew Wilton, then 
curator of Prints and Drawings 
at YCBA, noted that the library 
hadn't taken good care of their 
treasures: ''lJ.l those years in 
musty storage at the Worcester 
Public 
Library 
didn't 
help 
matters. Some have mold, some 
are foxing. some are brittle, some 
are fastened to heavy mounting 
boards, which will have to be 
removed. All need cleaning--a 
very touchy process, especially 
with pencil drawings." 

But now, even after a 
thorough 
cleaning at Yale's 
sterile 
conservation 
lab 
on 
the museum's third floor, tb'e 
drawings remain out of sight. 
"They are hiding in boxes, 
too fragile to see the light Of 
day," lamented one WorceSter 
reporter. Wilton admitted sadly 
that the works '\.vill spend 
the better part of their days in 
boxes" because of their fragil'e 
condition: "That is the fate ·of 
old drawings." 

After conservation, the drawmgs were 
given acquisition numbers--a tracking de'1ce 
for every work in the collection--and @eo 
in the large, wooden card catalogue in the 
from of the department. Today, Scott \X'ilcox, 
Wuton's replacement as curator, can "pull" 
the drawings for viewers to examine under 
the amber lights of the Pnnts and Drawings 
reading room. When the drawings are no longer 
needed, they are tucked back on a shelf and 
locked in a cupboard, where the) someomes 
wait for months until they are seen again.
