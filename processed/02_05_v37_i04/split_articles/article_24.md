playing jealous lover of a non-human 
entity. 

The sight of another possible Yale 
student stepping onto the J-7 Milford caused 
my heart to skip an anxious beat, rousing my 
apprehension that my trip would be ruined 
by the presence of an acquaintance. These 
fears were 6nally realized a couple months 
after my initial visit, at which point the mall 
and I progressed beyond mere flirtation to a 
full-fledged relationship. I was leaning over a 
counter in the food court, lustfully watching 
my (thankfully not Thai, Indian, or Thai-Indian 
fusion) orange chicken as it was smeared into a 
Styrofoam bowl, when the customer to my left 
poked me on the shoulder. 
"Davenport, right?" she asked. 
·~ ... yeah." I glanced longingly at my 
chicken, now waiting for me by the register. 
"Cool, cool. It's always good to see a 
fellow Yalie outside of New Haven." 
I nodded aod stalled, hoping she wouldn't 
wait for me, but she stood by the cashier, 
expectandy sipping her soda. After hesitating 
for an awkward moment, I paid for my food, 
and we walked together to a nearby table. 
"God, Panda Express is disgusting," she 
said after we sat down, stabbing her Mongolian 
egetables with a plastic fork. "Like, what is 
· ? De6nitely not Chinese." 
"Oh, it's Pandanese." I hoped a stupid 
oke would scare her away. 
She paused uncertainly for a second, then 
~ ontinued. "So what brings you here?" 
I opened the plastic top of my bowl, and 
steam poured out. "Oh ... you know .... " 
''Yeah, de6nitely. Only having Urban 
Out6tters in New Haven can be such a drag 
sometimes. Like, it gets a litde old when every 
girl at a party is wearing that 'Everybody Loves 
a Randomly Ethnic Girl' shirt." She reached 
into ber jean pocket and pulled out a creased 
~beet of paper. "I actually brought a list of 
}>resents I need to buy, but I can't find them 
anywhere in this dirt hole. Like I want to buy a 
set of headphones for-" 
''Well, there's a Radio Shack on the 6rst 
oor, by Sears." 
She raised her eyebrows. "Oh yeah? Know 
ere I can find a UConn jersey?" 
"Champs. Second floor." 
"How about wrapping paper? And I'm 
t sure I brought enough money." 
"There's a Hallmark ... and a Fleet A TM is 
t around here, by the food coun." 
"Geez." She folded her list and put it 
ck in her pocket. "How often do you come 
I shrugged. ''I dunno ... maybe twice, three 
times a month. Depends on my workload." . 
''You like shopping that much?" 
''Well .... " Good question. I hadn't actually 
purchased anything on three out of my last 
four trips, so what the hell was I doing here? 
I decided to lie. "Uh, yeah. I guess I'm a 
shopaholic." I cringed. 
She nodded knowingly. "Sometimes you 
gotta get your Abercrombie 6x." 
After we parted ways (she, to buy gifts, 
me, to spy on the awkward salespeople at 
the cellular phone kiosk), her question rested 
uncomfortably in my mind. Why was I so 
infatuated with this place? As I stumbled to 
the escalator, intoxicated by contemplation, 
the artifice of the environment suddenly 
suffocated me--the soft drone of peoples' 
voices, the harsh, neon lighting, the stuffy air 
conditioning. I felt dizzy. I unwound my scarf 
so I could breathe, and leaned against the wall 
of Subway. As the sight of the familiar logo, I 
smiled, remembering how I had once argued 
with one of my friends over where to get 
sandwiches. 
"What's wrong with Subway?" I had asked 
her. I had a frequent buyer's punch card. 
"Mega-bland 
corporate 
evil 
aside, 
hometown places are always better. Everyone 
knows that." 
HomekJwn. I had scoffed at the notion 
at the time, but the memory of my friend's 
comment stirred me. I stepped back from the 
Subway sign, moved by a sudden epiphany. 
I didn't come to the mall because of the 
shopping, or the anonymity, or even the 
refuge it offered me from problem sets and 
course packets. I was addicted to it because 
of its familiarity. For me---'.1 member of an 
Air Force family, the permanent New Girl 
and wearied occupant of several stat~s before 
entering high school-"bome" was more of 
an abstract concept than a place. If its inherent 
significance is its consistency, then home was 
never an address or a city for me; it was my 
parents' station wagon coasting down the 
interstate, the books I pored over in the car, 
and my brother snoring with his face smashed 
against the seat belt. Home was Motel Six, 7-
11, Starbucks, and Payless: and however mega-
bland it may be, home was Subway. 
Growing up, each new "hometown" 
presented me with a new set of faces, streets, 
and rules to learn. In Arizona, a glass of Coca-
Cola is a "pop"; if you call it anything but a 
"soda" in Virginia, you sound like an idiot. We 
bought our groceries at Kroger in Nebraska, 
Meijer's in Michigan, and Giant in V uginia. 
As an adolescent, it's dif6cult enough to face 
~ 
each coming day with the fear of changed :.: 
body parts; compound that with a constant·~ 
incursion of new places and people, and my 
prepubescent existence began to look a lot 
like Heraclitus' river of 6ux. Throughout my 
childhood, I was willing to accept whatever life 
preservers were tossed my way, even if they 
were stamped with national brand names. The 
effect of which, apparendy, was my ability to 
find solace in the dim glow of a shopping mall, 
the bastion of American commercialism. 
My newfound awareness of the root of 
my addiction began to make me uneasy. In my 
desperate efforts to cling to some vestige of 
my childhood, had I become the poster child 
for "mega-bland corporate evil?" Was CT Post 
bad? Was my lover evil? 
Shaken by this unsetding notion, I decided 
to leave the mall, once and for all. I hurried 
to get out, hoping to catch an early bus back 
to Yale. Shoppers, store fronts, and kiosks 
whizzed by me unnoticed, but I paused wheh 
I glimpsed a photo booth near the exit. One 
last toss in the hay, J thought to myself, for old 
times' sake. 
While posing behind the musty red 
curtains of the photo booth, I mused over the 
past few months, mentally cueing a montage of 
myself frolicking through CT Post's corridorS, 
my hands loaded with stuffed bags and Auntie 
Anne's pretzels while geode muzak tinkled in 
the background. The click of the camera jolted 
me out of my daydream, and I crossed my eyes 
and stuck my tongue out. You're breaking up 
for the right reasons, I reassured mysel£ Has 
your liberal education taught you nothing, if 
not to hate The Man? 
I stepped outside and waited for the 
filmstrip of four poses to develop. The machine 
whirred softly for a second, then spat out my 
pictures through a slot. In the last three shots, 
I was making silly faces and obscene gestures; 
the first one, however, was taken before I was 
ready. In it, I looked utterly serene. 
I stuffed the pictures into my purse and 
hurried to the exit, knowing it wouldn't be 
long before I returned. I knew my relationship 
was hardly healthy, and that eventually I would 
need to move past the images of my transient 
childhood. I also knew, however, that CT Post 
seemed to possess the capacity to make me 
happy. Explicable or not, for a mere $1.25 in 
bus fare I could buy a few hours of bliss-
well worth its generic, artificial packaging. -
