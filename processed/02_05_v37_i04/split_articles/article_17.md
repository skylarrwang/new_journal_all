o ~etop 
of a hill, overlooking 
a grove of towering 
oaks and skinny pines, a 
glassy, ultra-modern building 
will sit. No smoke will puff from 
its chimneys. No Sew2ge will flow 
from its pipes. No heat will escape in 
the winter. No cool air will seep out in the 
summer. Its roof will be blanketed with ferns 
and moss. A natural breeze will drift through 
its sunny halls. Nothing inside will be tainted 
by pesticides or other chemicals. This is Yale's 
promise-a tiny slice of paradise on Prospect 
Street by 2008. 


The School of Forestry and Environmental 
Studies (FES) raised 27 million dollars to design 
and construct an environmentally-friendly 
building to be located in Sachem's Wood-an 
ironic misnomer for the dilapidated one-acre 
field hemmed in by the backside of Olin 
Memorial Laboratory, Kline Biology Tower 
and a power plant. This project has attracted 
the attention of architects from all over the 
world. Robert A.M. Stern, Dean of Yale School 
of Architecture (YSOA), who has designed 
corporate offices for 
many high-profile 
companies, including Walt Disney and The 
Gap. describes this project as unprecedented. 
"I don't know of any university building 
that lus such high environmental ambitions 
as this one," he says. Universities have not 
been enviro-trendsetters, and until now, Yale 
lus been no exception. This is precisely the 
argument that Steven Kellen, FES professor 
and lead faculty member working on the 
project, has employed to pressure President 
22 
Levin into supporting this new building. "If 
we presume to be a leader, we should act like a 
leader," Kellert says. 


But can Yale pull it off? The project is 
ambitious for many reasons, not the least 
of which is the building's designated site. It 
will be a challenge to design a building that 
communes with nature in a city like New 
Haven, on a street like Prospect. "The building 
is going in what would have to be described 
as a rat hole," says James Gustav Speth, the 
Dean of FES, the founder of the Natural 
Resources Defense Council, former Director 
of the Administrator of the United Nations 
Development Programme and the author of 
RedS~ at Morning: America and the Crisis of 
the Global Environment. "I mean it is right out 
here," he says, pointing out the window of 
his office. "It's a rat hole. There's a big power 
plant sitting there now and it's the ugliest thing 
at Yale." 


The Yale architectural landscape also 
poses a challenge for designers: it will take 
imagination to build an ultra-modern building 
that meets sustainability requirements and also 
blends into Yale's gothic context. In designing 
the recent expansion of the Museum of 
Modern Art in New York City, architect Yoshi 
Taniguchi worked hard to harmonize the new 
building with its midtown surroundings. Paul 
Goldberger, the Dean of Parsons School of 
Design, writes in a review for The Ntw Yorker, 
"Until now, the Modern has had an unresolved, 
almost 
hesitant 
relationship 
with 
midtown 
Manhattan .... The old Modem occupied 
the street in sullen isolation; this one dances 
with its neighbors." The architect of the new 
FES building will have to work hard to get 
this building to tango with its stony Prospect 
Street companions. 'The gothic context is a 
fundamental expression of Yale," says Dean 
Stern. "Plopping a glassy box down in the 
middle of it doesn't seem to be enough of a 
response." 


The architect will also face logistical 
stumbling blocks. The building seeks to be 
"energy-neutral" (it will consume no energy 
that it hasn't generated itself), a system 
technically ambitious to design, even in a 
vacuum. The site picked out for the building, 
Sachem's Wood, is a sloping hill; constructing 
any building on this type of terrain is tricky. 
The climate is also a concern; a general 
criterion of sustainable buildings is that they 
are naturally ventilated-that means no air 
conditioning. New Haven gets hot and humid 
in the summers. Designing a building in a 
New Haven that is naturally ventilated and 
also bearable to work in twelve months a year 
seems almost impossible to imagine. So can it 
be done? "I doubt it," says Dean Stern. 


The implications of the success or 
failure of this building will extend far 
beyond Yale's gates. This little-50,000 
square foot-building has generated a buzz 
among architects around the globe. "One 
thing you appreciate when you go around 
the world is how much people look to places 
like Yale," says University Planner Pamela 
Delphenich, an architect herself.

ustainability conference in Oregon last 
month, the new FES building "was the talk 
of the conference," says Delphenich, and 
ground hasn't even been broken yet. Over 
the next few years, architects, universities and 
the environmental community at large will 
be watchlng the progress of Yale's new FES 
building. The success of thls little building 
will set an architectural benchmark likely to be 
noted around the world. 


ALTHOUGH CONSTRUCTION WON'T begin 
for at least eight months, the process 
swell underway: an archltect has been 
chosen and a landscape archltect solicited to 
turn Sachem's Wood into a wood. The building 
will be the home of the Yale Environmental 
Center and will serve as a base for the School 
of Forestry and Environmental Studies. It 
will house the undergraduate Environmental 
Studies department and provide office space 
for Yale Students Environmental Coalition 
(YSEC). I twill also have exhibit space, meeting 
rooms, an auditorium and an environmental 
library. The building is one piece of the 
long term makeover of Science Hill, which 
stretches from the end of Hillhouse Ave. to 
the Divinity school. ''This whole area is going 
to be landscaped in a very different, and I 
think, spectacular way," says James Gustav 
Speth, Dean of FES. 


Unlike the other departments--chemistry 
and engineering most notably-with buildings 
popping up on Science Hill, FES was requited 
to raise all the money for construction itself. 
"The chemistry building next door frustrates 
me a little because it gets paid for by Yale," 
said Stephen Kellett, a professor at FES and 
the lead faculty member in charge of the 
construction of the new building. "Because 
we are like a self-sufficient professional school, 
we are expected to raise our own resources." 


Kellett is the visionary behind the building, 
and has been pushing the project for 
four years. When Dean Speth 
arrived at FES, one of 
the 6rst projects he 
took on was a 
fundraising 
u February 2005 
campaign for the building. Donors include 
Richard Kroon, former analyst at Donaldson, 
Lufkin & Jenrette and managing partner of its 
Sprout Group venture capital fund; Edward 
Bass, a member of the Yale Corporation 
and Chief Executive Officer of Fine Line 
Inc., a diversified venture and investment 
capital company; Carl Knobloch, for whom 
the Yale Environment Center will be named; 
and Gilman Ordway, who operates a ranch in 
Wyoming. 


Twenty-seven million dollars may seem 
extravagant, but it's a pittance compared to 
what Yale is spending on its residential college 
renovations, projected tocost$80 million nearly 
a decade ago. Also, sustainable architecture-
the genre to which thls building will belong-
is, in general, more expensive initially because 
it requires sophisticated design and advanced 
technology to reduce energy consumption, 
pollution and other negative environmental 
impacts. The rationale is that the investment 
is made up in maintenance costs, which are 
usually lower for green buildings because 
energy consumption is lower. Universities are 
especially good sites for sustainable buildings 
because the cost savings are guaranteed to last. 
''Yale doesn't build buildings for the ten-year 
haul; Yale builds for the one thousand-year 
haul," observes Dean Stern. Old universities 
stick around-and so do their buildings. 


Although it's difficult to know whether 
the "we can do it ourselves" rhetoric was 
adopted after FES learned that Yale did not 
plan to fund the project, either way, FES has 
turned its self-sufficiency into a dogma for the 
building. The fact that the School of Forestry 
and Environmental Studies raised the money 
alone is important. Kellett has expressed one 
of his design objectives for the new building, 
with the slogan, ''Build a Ford not a- Ferrari," 
a catch phrase he later describes as "a cutesy 
wutesy way of saying if Yale had subsidized 
the project, the building would not have 
the widespread applicability it does now: it 
wouldn't be an instrUctional model for others 
because they could say, 'Oh yeah you built it 
because Yale is so rich,' or 'because you got 
all this extra money.' It's' very important we 
don't spend too much.'' To insure that Yale is 
building something that other universities can 
emulate, the costs can not be excessive. 


''We are willing to spend an 
initial cost premium, 
but not 
a great initial cost premium and not one that 
can't be easily rationalized by paybacks in a 
reasonable period of time," Kellett adds. 


FES 
has 
invested 
more 
in 
thls 
construction than money. The new building 
has been pitched as a physical embodiment 
of the century-old principles of the school. 
The mandate is to create a building that 
is a "symbol of FES' academic program," 
according to Bob Dinseeko, the landscape 
architect in charge of Science Hill's overall 
redevelopment. Delphenich, the University 
Planner, adds that commissioning a building 
for which the physical structure has meaning 
is unusual. ''We do not often do a project that 
is so symbolic-it is a physical manifestation 
of their values." In its broadest meaning, 
sustainability will be the concept embodied. 
At the most basic level, the building must be 
designed in such a way as to minimize adverse 
effects on the natural environment. 


:, 
Devdopment, 
sprawl, 
and 
wasteM 
buildings are critical environmental concerns: 
''The environmental crisis is very much a 
crisis of the built environment,'' Kellett' 
says. A climbing world population and the 
urbanization of undeveloped countries hav~ 
exacerbated development issues, 
making, 
the need for sustainable design even more 
pressing. 


The traditional approach to sustainable 
development has been to mitigate, minimize 
and avoid the physical effects of building. 
Sustainable architecture emphasizes attention 
to energy and resource use, atmospheric. 
degradation, toxi6cation of food chains, 
pollution and loss of biodiversity. But what 
is perhaps most exciting about the new FES 
building is that it promises to go beyond 
the traditional definition of sustainability, 
to incorporate a less mainstream and more . 
cutting edge vision of green design. "From . 
my perspective,'' Kellett explains, "there is 
another side to the environmental crisis. And 
that is the increasing separation and alienation . 
of people from the natural environment." 


Kellett's vision for sustainable architecture, 
seeks to reconnect humans with nature. "We. 
evolved in a biological world, not an atcificial 
wodd. Our fundamental physical, mental 
and, I would even argue, moral or spiritual 
well-being depends upon our experiential 
connection to nature. We are just beginning tCl 
discover what that means. But it appears to be 
a biologically encoded need." 


Biophilia, the theory that humans have an 
innate tendency to affiliate with nature, u.-as 
6rst proposed by the well-,

known 
ffarvard biolo~st 
E.O. Wilson. Wilson and Kellert 
later published Hypotheses on Biophilia, further 
outlining this principle. Biophillic design, 
introduced in the book, demands more 
than renewable energy, good insulation and 
minimized waste. Also referred to as "positive-
impact design," biophillic design requires a 
more rigorous interpretation of what it means 
to be green. Kellen sees in this building the 
potential to "achieve a new benchmark of 
sustainable design by expanding the envelope 
of what we mean by sustainable design. We 
have kind of high hopes for this." 


If you believe, as Kellert does, that the 
crisis of the built environment is not an intrinsic 
and inevitable failure of the modern world, 
the question becomes: how can architecture 
not only mitigate adverse effects on natural 
systems, but also, as he puts it, "restore a 
degree of positive experiential connection" to 
nature? Part of the biophilia hypothesis is that 
humans learn better and are more productive 
in natural environments, which makes a 
college campus a perfect testing ground for 
the theory. Examples already exist on campus, 
Kellett argues, pointing out, "The old campus 
is replete with those lcinds of connections." 


The courtyards, the ivy growing up the sides 
of buildings, the stone help us feel connected 
to the natural world. 


According to Kellett, who was not 
trained as an architect, successfully fusing 
biophilia and architectural design hinges on 
attention to context, which seems to be the 
crux of good contemporary design. "You 
can do it in various ways: directly, indirectly 
and symbolically. You can do it with the 
materials you use, the environments you 
create, the ornamental qualities you create, 
but you can also do with the relationship of 
the building to its landscape." Kellett argues 
that a building must show a commitment to, 
and a compatibility with the place where it is 
built. There is an integrity and sense of place 
on Old Campus, he says. ''You don't feel that 
way at Kline Biology Tower, I think because it 
is out of scale ecolo~cally and culturally with 
its context. Even though it was considered 
when it was built to be one of the great Phillip 
Johnson buildings, it was almost built like it 
stood by itself. without any relation, like it was 
in a vacuum." 


The context for the FES building is 
Sachem's Wood: in fact, the new building 
includes a title of "stewardship over Sachem's 
Wood," as Dean Speth puts it. The Wood will 
24 
be landscaped by the 
Olin Corporation, in conjunction with 
Cesar Pelli-who designed the acclaimed 
Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
If all goes according to plan, Sachem's Wood 
will become a destination spot for students 
and faculty. In its present condition, Sachem's 
Wood requires more than a makeover-
nothing less than serious surgery will turn it 
into a pleasant space on campus. The Wood's 
revitalization is just one part of a dialogue 
that was started 15 years ago about how to 
redesign Prospect Street and Science Hill. 


Yale has cropped up in spurts, and Science 
Hill, a half-mile stretch, may be the last 
project of this scale that Yale takes on for a 
while. "It is the last remaining superblock," 
notes. Dinseeko, one of Yale's landscape 
architects. There isn't much more space left 
that needs redesigning. 


A
UNIVERSITY-SPONSORED 
APPROACH 
to sustainability is relatively new. 
Following the advice of the Advisory 
Committee on Environmental Management, 
last year Yale hired Julie Newman, formerly 
the Sustainability Director at the University 
of New Hampshire, to direct sustainability 
at Yale. Given the lack of attention paid 
to 
sustainability in recent renovations, 
the environmental community welcomed 
the creation of Newman's position. In 
comparison to other universities, Yale stacks 
up poorly. "Well, yes it's behind, but I say that 
reluctantly," Newman says. ''While sure, we're 
not as far as Harvard, there's so much fire and 
excitement about this at Yale and that will 
enable us to move forward." 


Perhaps Yale's most pressing problem 
relating to its built environment is energy use. 
"The momentum for the greening of Yale 
is beginning to grow," Speth says. ''A lot of 
the greening of the University is focused on 
the energy system of the University, which 
is antiquated, wasteful and polluting." Speth 
says. A FES committee designed to evaluate 
the energy use at Yale found that Yale's 
energy consumption was high relative to 
other schools. "Yale has more greenhouse gas 
emissions than 32 countries," Speth says, with 
the qualifier, "they are little countries. My big 
concern as a Dean here is to try to encourage 
the University to do something about this." 


Environmentalism aside, Yale 
will have to do something. It's now the law. 
Last June, Connecticut adopted a greenhouse 
gas reduction policy and a renewable energy 
policy that will control the State's power 
utilities. T he question for Yale, Speth thinks, is 
how the University wants to respond: "Does' 
Yale want to keep up with the state? Do we 
want to be leaders on this? Do we want to be 
the last people to do something?" 


The new FES building has been pitched 
as an opportunity for Yale to show a 
commitment to being a part of the solution. 
Yale recognized this--and in typical Yale 
fashion, the building has been promised 
to be the greenest of the green. ''When we 
started to talk about this four years ago, it was 
pretty strange stuff," Kellett admits. ''Very 
few people understood what we were tallcing 
about. In a few short years, the University 
has become extraordinarily committed to the 
notion of sustainability." This building is an 
opportunity for Yale to prove it. 


The concept of sustainability, from a 
philosophical point of view, is well-matched 
for a university like Yale. "We want to be a 
realization of our ideals in built form because 
we are basically a school about sustainability;' 
Kellert says. Yale has sustained itself for 
three hundred years; it seems apt that Yale 
should adopt an architecture that also values 
longevity. 


WITH SUCH LOFTY AMBmONS, AND 
such a hilly, humid, urban site, the 
architect selected for the project 
will have to have a great deal of imagination 
to pull this off. To add to the challenge, 
green architecture requires incorporating 
sophisticated science and technology into 
the design; according to Kellert, it is tricky 
because "sustainable design CUJS across every 
function." 


The paradox is that the architect must also 
be able to divorce himself from traditional 
uses of mechanical systems in the building: 
Sustainable design is what Kellett dubs "back 
to the future design." To make a building 
sustainable one must 6nd alternatives to 
energy-wasting machines. "One hundred years 
ago, people just sweated it out," Dean Stern 
says, "and went home at 3pm in the summer." 
Today our expectations have changed.
