EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Kaye's gallery, tucked away in a suburban Connecticut home, showcases the works of Outsider artistsâ€”individuals who create art outside the mainstream art world.  Many of these artists are also mental patients, though this is not a prerequisite for inclusion.  The gallery features a diverse range of artwork, including the vibrant, eclectic paintings of Hansen, who adorned his canvas with everything from himself as a man and a woman to Medusa, Winken, Blinken, Nod, and the Whore of Babylon.  Another notable artist is Clyde Angel, a wanderer who crafts metal sculptures from landfill scraps, his story blending fact and fiction.  Kaye emphasizes the focus on the art itself, rather than the artists' backgrounds or mental states.  Her gallery, a sanctuary in the quiet suburbs, reflects the outsider nature of the art it displays, a far cry from the bustling galleries of SoHo.
