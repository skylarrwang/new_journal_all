"Hooky Walker 1 1" 
by Frederick Lancier 
The Prints and Drawings room doesn't usually receive generous 
donations of rare drawings. Mostly, explains Wilcox, the department 
fields a lot of calls from "people who want to give you things, like a 
little print they found in their grandmother's attic." Like Paul Mellon, 
donors want to get a tax break, they want to get rid of a work, and 
they want to donate to their alma mater. "But 99 percent of the time a 
donation is of no great significance." 

Wilcox doesn't need to tell me about this 99 percent I've been 
shuffling through them for four months. As student assistant for the 
Prints and Drawings Department, I have grown used to violent hunting 
scenes (we call them "sporting prints"), bored aristocrats ("portraits"), 
and prim classical gardens ("landscapes'). It is my distinct privilege to 
enter into the museum's computer database a litany of dull information 
on works that seem to simply appear here. 

On my first day as a YCBA assistant, Tim Goodhue, the art registrar 
in charge of keeping track of museum acquisitions, had some bad news. 
He had discovered over twelve hundred un-accessioned prints-seven 
uncovered black boxes filled with folders of around 170 prints and 
drawings that had been lost in storage for eight years. 

Some of the folders housed fashion plates, some showcased 
political cartoons. On a dull Tuesday, four hours into weighing the 
differences between aquatint and mezzotint portraits, I came across 
one piece that made me laugh out loud. A tiny monkey looked out at 
me, his hand stretched open in cruel glee. Below him, the inscription 
read: "Hooky Walker!!" (exclamation points included). The magnifying 
glass revealed the crazed animal to be the work of Frederick Lancier, 
who engraved it some time around 1827. I showed the print to Phil, the 
department's assistant curator, who has been looking at art for thirteen 
years. He laughed out loud too. Phil's internet search revealed "hooky 
walker" to be a Victorian expression for something extraordinary and 
unnecessary. Then he printed out his internet search results and filed 
them away in a docket for artwork 1996.1.215 that may never again be 
opened.

On the upper level of the Rare Books Department, buried in a 
long, flat drawer that you'll need a key to open, boxes and boxes of 
crumbling maps await unfurling fingertips. 

The maps look 
nothing like the world we know today: they show dramatic geometric 
fortifications and isles curving in the wrong directions. They are fragile 
and undependable. They are useless and beautiful. 

These maps first belonged to a boy my age. At 19, George Legge 
became Captain of the Pembroke sailing vessel. In 1682, he was named 
Baron of Dartmouth, and in 1683, he was given command of an entire 
British expedition to the far-off island of Tangier. During his voyages, 
he enlisted fleets of cartographers to draw alongside his fleets of boats. 
His early efforts resulted in a vast collection for his nation, which he 
bequeathed to every future Baron of Dartmouth. 

After many successful missions, Legge returned to London to take 
up the lofty position of "Master of the Horse and Governor of the 
Tower of London." When William of Orange invaded Britain, Legge 
was imprisoned in his own tower, where, in 1691, he died of apoplexy. 
The maps stayed in the family until the 1960s, when a dying aristocracy 
sold them at auction. The British Museum competed with a private 
dealer for the maps and the dealer walked away with a significant 
portion of the collection. 

When Elisabeth Fairman , a curator at YBAC, put together a show 
of maps in the early '90s, she invited a correspondent from the British 
Museum, who was very surprised to find the Legge maps. Neither the 
dealer nor the auction house had said anything to either museum about 
the split-up; they had each been looking for the missing maps for years. 
"So here's an example of a very large collection for a single person 
that got divided up in two museums," Fairman says, looking across the 
solitary maps; as if towards a slim, lonesome arrow pointing across 
oceans toward its brethren, nestled in twin boxes somewhere in Britain. 
"They had no idea we had anything."

Up on the second floor, on a wall of the Prints and Drawings Reading 
Room, hiding beneath a screen to protect it so the natural light couldn't 
fade it, hangs a watercolor by George Hicks. The painting depicts two 
peasants standing in the doorway, their son playing at their feet. "Look 
at the little boy-it's just wonderful," sighed Wilcox, who is the reason 
the painting is hanging in the museum at all. 

Wilcox first saw "The Sinews of Old England" in London , where 
he often travels to scout for works of art to acquire for the museum's 
collection. He spotted it at Rupert Moss' gallery, and was "very keen on 
it." He and his coworker Tim Barringer , an art history professor, fell in 
love with the painting. "It is very beautiful," Wilcox said, momentarily 
mesmerized. But for whatever reason, the third party on their trip, 
Malcolm Warner, the curator of paintings at the time, detested it. 
"Oh, Malcolm hates genre paintings," Gillian Forrester, Wilcox's 
co-worker interrupts. "He always has." When the two proponents went 
into a curatorial committee, a group that meets monthly to decide 
how to handle the museum's funds and discuss proposed acquisitions, 
Warner's dislike for the painting "killed it in committee." In the world 
of acquisitions, one man's opinion can sway a museum's collections. 

Still, Wilcox remained hopeful. 

A few months later, Barringer was in New York giving a lecture on 
Victorian painting at Christie's. He showed a slide of the painting that 
he and Wilcox had loved. After the talk, a Connecticut collector of 
Victorian paintings who had been in the audience went up the street 
to an art fair. The collector must have gasped: it was the same work 
from the talk he had just attended. Mr. Moss had sold the painting to 
the private collector, and Wilcox thought sadly, "Well, that's the end of 
that." 

But about a year ago, while skimming through a sales catalog, 
Wilcox came across a photograph of the painting he had pined after. 
This time, Warner was no longer working for the museum, and the price 
of the painting was about half what Moss asked for during the height 
of the market's craze for Victorian Genre paintings. (Andrew Lloyd 
Weber's collecting frenzy had driven prices up, Forrester explained-he 
was buying anything available at any cost.) The museum acquired the 
work, and every so often when he thinks no one is looking, Wilcox will 
lift the screen tenderly to sneak a peek at the painting it took him so 
long to buy.
