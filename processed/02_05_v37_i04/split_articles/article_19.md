O CALL THE WORSHIP SERVlCE at Immanuel Missionary Baptist 
Church "vibrant'' is like calling the Statue of Liberty "a big 
girl"-it doesn't quite make the point. The Immanuel service 
inspires emotional intensity within its parishioners. Neither forced nor 
flamboyant, the service seems to produce deep communal spirituality 
with surprising naturalness. It is a participatory experience: a dozen 
different people lead the service at different points, using scripted and 
spontaneous call-and-response rather than prolonged lecturing. The 
steady stream of soulful music emanating from the choir to the back 
pews creates a soundtrack for this dramatic religious expression. Even 
for an atheist guest, it is hard to resist being swept away. 


"Are you of a different faith?" the woman beside me asked after 
I passed on the communion plate, foregoing wine and a wafer. The 
question came at the tail end of a service during which the pastor had 
nearly blown out the audio system with shouts of "Come on over!" and 
"Jump up in Jesus' name!" A number of women had broken into tears 
and a well-dressed gendeman had leapt out of his seat, stomping and 
yelling in a spontaneous spiritual spasm. These passionate worshipers 
did not seem out of place; throughout the service, dozens of 
parishioners called out and clapped to some of the best gospel music 
and most thrilling oratory I had ever heard. My previous religious life 
had consisted of coerced High Holiday attendance at Beth Shalom 
Synagogue in Seattle, so for me the black church experience was a 
completely new one. It wasn't that I was merely, as my neighbor had 
clearly noticed, "of a different faith"-! was of an entirely different 
world.

~'>Â£MANUEL BAPTIST stands on the corner of Chapel and Day streets 
in New Haven. It is pyramid-shaped and made of brown, layered 
brick-it's distincdy 1970s modern look belies Immanuel's status 
as Connecticut's oldest black Baptist church. The congregation dates 
back to 1825, when several black members of New Haven's two Baptist 
churches began meeting in secret to pray. A 1985 church brochure states 
that Immanuel's founders "worshipped in halls, yards, private homes or 
wherever possible" until 1845, when the white First Baptist Church 
of New Haven recognized them as an independent congregation. 


The Third Baptist Church of New Haven became New Haven's first 
autonomous black church. 


But, New Haven's African-American Baptists continued to meet 
informally until1884, when they built their own church in Immanuel's 
current location on Chapel Street. The church that was built housed 
the Immanuel community for nearly ninety years, but condemned by 
the city for half its life, it was in use for only forty. The "new" church 
was erected in 1973; its construction was the pet project of then-
30 
Reverend C.M. Cofield. His wife, Elsie, had urged him to buy an old 
Episcopal Church that was up for sale nearby, but Cofield wanted a 
new building, whatever the price. "I thought black people needed to 
plan something of their own, not something whites used up and sold 
to black folk." With loans from a few local banks, Cofield raised $7 
million for the upgrade, creating another first in the Immanuel history 
book. No black church had ever raised more than one million for a 
new edifice. 


The Cofields, married nearly sixty years, are products of a bygone 
era. They stand when their guest excuses himself to find the restroom 
and are too polite to complain when our interview runs grossly 
overtime. Rev. Cofield's quiet manner casts his slight frame in a brooding 
seriousness. "I had difficulty finding satisfaction in what I'd done," he 
says of his 53 years as a pastoL "I never really felt at peace with myself 
until I'd retired." It was a curious admission from the Reverend,whose 
36 years behind the Immanuel pulpit make him the longest-serving 
pastor in the congregation's nearly two century history. 


By contrast, Elsie Cofield, Rev. Cofield's wife, is warm and effusive. 
For nearly twenty years she has been a celebrated community leader in 
her own right. After retiring from teaching in 1987, Mrs. Cofield founded 
the AIDS Interfaith Network, a non-profit organization providing 
comprehensive care to people living with AIDS in greater New Haven. 
Beginning with just a few volunteers in the church basement, AIDS 
Interfaith boasts its own building across the street from the church 
and has become one of the city's top two agencies providing HIV I 
AIDS support. Mrs. Cofield's office is replete with plaques and awards 
from dozens of organizations, from the NAACP to Hispanos Unidos, 
honoring her work in the fight against AIDS. "We've done a lot," she 
admits with a grin. 


The Cofields are iconic at Immanuel Baptist Church. Besides 
building the church, they worked to ensure that the "community would 
not be forgotten." Establishing a weekly soup kitchen, a "clothes 
closet," and a homeless shelter, the Cofields almost single-handedly 
made Immanuel one of the more active churches in supporting the 
black community. Both see public service as a fundamental element of 
their faith. As Rev. Cofield puts it, "I don't think a church is authentic 
unless it has a missionary philosophy and action." 


On the surface, the Cofields' mission still plays a prominent role 
at Immanuel. For Ola Sanders, a member of the church since 1952, 
Immanuel is still a "foundation of New Haven" both "spiritually and 
socially." She points to the soup kitchen, the homeless shelter, and 
the low-income housing that the church rents to New Haveners, as 
examples of the church's importance in New Haven. Diane Petaway, 
an Immanuel member since 1986, agrees. ''Because of the community
