today has a Reaganesque meaning: People are poor 
not about drugs or alcohol or abuse anymore, but 
have bought into this." -Rev. Ross-Lee 
services we provide, if someone in New Haven has a problem, [they] 
know where Immanuel Baptist is." Ms. Pettaway, who visits the elderly 
and the sick as an Immanuel "Interfaith Giver," believes a "majority of 
church members are active in community service." 

Cofield's successor wants to continue the legacy of volunteerism 
and charity. At 42, Rev. Samuel Ross-Lee is a dynamic and dramatic 
force from the pulpit, his enormous baritone as remarkable in song as it 
is rousing in sermon. His speaking style is animated and pedagogical-
an appropriate blend of his Morehouse and Harvard degrees. Asked if 
he sees himself as a moral teacher, Ross-Lee replies, "I'm scared of that 
word." Instead, he prefers "prophetic," not in its traditional religious 
meaning but "in the Cornell West sense of the word--a social critic 
with notion of the divine." 

It is difficult to conceive of just how different Rev. Ross-Lee is from 
his predecessor. Rev. Cofield arrived five minutes early to our meeting, 
dressed in a sleek, tan business suit; Ross-Lee arrived ten minutes late in 
an Adidas workout suit. Cofield rarely replied to questions in excess of 
twenty words; Ross-Lee's responses were often near dissertation length. 
His only moments of reticence came with questions about his family. 
(When he was four years old. Rev. Ross-Lee's mother abandoned him 
"for the typical reasons" to the foster system.) As well-versed in modern 
philosophy as he is in faith-based initiatives, Ross-Lee references articles 
from both Ebony and Esquire in a single thought. He straddles, often 
awkwardly, the fence between populism and elitism. 

On at least one issue, however, the old-school/ new-school 
approaches of Reverends Cofield and Ross-Lee converge. As Ross-
Lee put it, "Immanuel should be a force in this community." To him 
this means preaching, service and sacrifice. At one service I attended, 
the church recognized six or seven parishioners for community service 
work and general civic-mindedness. The preacher asked the community 
to follow their example: "God has blessed us with homes, food and 
comfort. Let's go out and help someone who can't help themselves. As 
the kids say, 'You feelin' me?, 


t;T l'o:OT ENOUGH PEOPLE ARE GET11NG THE MESSAGE, suggests 
Rev. Ron Smith, who subbed for an ill Rev. Ross-Lee on one of 
the Sundays I visited. Recently, church volunteerism has been 
dwindling, and the situation at the soup kitchen-the longtime staple 
of Immanuel community service-has become critical. 'We need your 
help," pleaded Rev. Smith. Without it, he warns, "we may have to shut 
it down." 

In the embattled soup kitchen, only a dozen volunteers are on hand 
after services to scramble around a linoleum-floored auditorium and 
February 2005 
prepare food for the throngs of people already lined up outside. One 
volunteer, Mark Fletcher, hands out pastries and a Tang-like orange 
beverage. "There are a lot of people less fortunate than I am," Aetcher 
says. "I just see this as part of my duty at the church." A postal wor~er 
in Branford, Fletcher joined the church just this year, having been 
baptized in May. He told me he "loves Immanuel," but admitted he was 
disappointed by the "low number who work in the soup kitchen." 

There is evidence of a general decline in the Immanuel soup 
kitchen: four years ago the soup kitchen served "approximately 400 
people each Sunday." One of the afternoons I visited, between 80 and 
100 people came to eat, prompting a volunteer to describe it as a "busy 
day." Cofield noted that the Sunday soup kitchen lasted "two and a half 
hours" in his day. Today, the sign outside the building reads, "Soup 
Kitchen, Sunday, 1:30pm - 2:00pm." 

· 
Church leaders urge all members to volunteer at least one Sunday 
a month at the soup kitchen. Nevertheless, the bulk of the burden fall;; 
to what Deacon Charles Williams called "a small cadre" of regulars. 
"We should have people climbing on top of each other to do what's 
needed to be done [m the soup kitchen)," Williams says. Instead, "we're 
one step away from having to shut it down." The former principal 
of Hill High School, Williams is particularly troubled over the dearth 
of student volunteers at Immanuel and in the greater New Haven 
community. "Students• agendas tend to follow their parents• agendas," 
he said. "rm hopeful we can build a model for students here to carry 
on the Immanuel mission after us!' 

N 
ow THE DIRECTOR OF HiGH ScHooL L'ISTRUcnoN for New 
Haven Public Schools, Deacon Williams is one of a number of 
prominent parishioners in the New Haven community. Members 
and non-members of Immanuel refer to congregants as New Haven's 
"black bourgeois," pointing to members Brian Perkins. President of the 
New Haven School Board, Alvin Johnson, a top executive at Yale-N~w 
.. Haven Hospital, and Reggie Mayo, New Haven School Superintendent. 
The "well-to-do" label has stuck with Immanuel over the years. "It's 
just been the rubric it bears." says Rev. Cofield. 

Some at Immanuel embrace this characterization. "That's who we 
are," Jonathan Berryman admits matter-of-factly. Immanuel•s Minister 
of Music, Berryman graduated from Princeton in 1994 before attending 
Yale for his master's degree in sacred music. For Berryman, Immanuel 
is a place where New Haven's "upwardly-mobile" young African 
Americans can "identify with our peers." 

On the Sunday before we spoke, Rev. Ross-Lee welcomed a 
young couple, Ronald Sullivan. Jr. and Stephanie Robinson, as new

parishioners. Sullivan met Ross-Lee at Morehouse before heading 
to Harvard, where he and Robinson :1ttcnded law school while the 
Reverend got his theology degree. Sullivan is now a professor at Yale 
Law School. Robinson, formerly an aide to Senator Edward Kennedy, 
is~ now in private practice. Rev. Ross-Lee considers Immanuel a "pretty 
~epresentative microcosm" of New Ha,·en's black community, though 
he concedes, "I don't think it's inaccurate to call it middle-class or well-
established." 

, 
Most Immanuel parishioners acknowledge their relative affluence 
in New Haven's black community, but few believe the socioeconomic 
divide has interfered with the church's egalitarian goals. "I guess you 
c.ould say we're middle class," says Diane Petaway, a parishioner since 
the 1980s. But if there's a gap between Immanuel and the rest of the 
community, she says, "1 don't see it." For Petawa} and, indeed, probably 
most parishioners, Immanuel is a "warm, open church [that] makes 
.people feel at home, no matter who they are." 

Back at the soup kitchen, the view isn't so rosy. The latest 
,controversy stems from a decision ro allow Immanuel parishioners 
to get take-out-trays from the Soup Kitchen after worship lets out at 
one o'clock-half an hour before ~ew ~ Iaven's hungry are admitted. 
The result is a two-tiered system allowing Immanuel moms to grab 
some snacks to tide their kids over for the drive home while the hungry 
homeless wait outside in the cold. Brown, Grinvalsky and some other 
volunteers believe it is unfair for "church members to be served 
b~fore those down on their luck." There is "no interaction between 
parishioners and those who aren't," says Brown. ''They won't sit down 
to eat with the non-members, they just get their take-out tray and go." 

Grinvalsky and Brown believe the} represent a minority viewpoint 
at the Immanuel Soup Kitchen: "Those who haven't been doing it for 
a long time don't see it like we do," says Brown. And the soup kitchen's 
customers don't seem to be complaining; David Holland, a Vietnam 
veteran 'vith mental health problems, called the soup kitchen "a 
blessing" that allows him to eat a good meal without having to "collect 
empties." 

Reverend Cofield echoes Brown and Grinvalsky's sentiments. 
Asked if he thinks Immanuel is doing enough to help the community, 
~v. Cofield bluntly replies, ''No, I don't. I don't think it's on the agenda, 
but I don't know why." lie is not alone. Deacon William Knox, who has 
coordinated the Soup Kitchen for the past ten years, and worshipped 
at Immanuel for thirty, agrees that there has been a deficiency of civic-
mindedness at Immanuel in recent years. "You can't just join the church 
~o be a spectator," he says. ''You have to participate. You have to give 
something up." 

Born into "Jim Crow South" fifty years ago, Deacon Knox had 
to "go to the back door to get something to cat." Part of his duty as a 
Christian, he says, is to "be able to gi,·e something back, to empower 
somebod}' else," and he JS frustrated that more people don't share his 
philosophy. Knox speaks of a "culture of plenty" that has stripped 
society in general, and the congregation in particular, of its moral 
eurpose: "Kids see a car, a TV, some shoes that they don't have, and 
they're taught that they need those things." The effect, Knox says, is 
tpat "we aren't concerned about social things anymore." 

He is deeply frustrated by how far the church has drifted from its 
founding tenets: "People used to walk to Immanuel, but now the}' drive. 
32 
They don't see what goes on here anymore-murder, rape, prostitution, 
drug-dealing. The young men in this neighborhood are either dead or 
in jail--or on their way. The church is not involved in reaching out to 
them. We really haven't done enough." 

Rev. Ross-Lee agrees that his church can and should do more for 
the rest of 
ew Haven. "Our middle-class comfort has blunted our 
prophetic edge," be suggested. "In our contentment, we have become 
less noticing of social needs." Like Knox, he decries the consumerism 
that he believes pervades the African-American culture. He asks, "Why 
are we such a consumer culture as opposed to a builder culture? We 
need to be investors, in the Clinronian sense; we need to invest in 
people." For Ross-Lee, it's not a question of making more monc), but 
of "using the economic strength we already have, which is considerable, 
in a way that is ultimately helpful to the community." Pointing out that 
blacks comprise seventy percent of Seagram's consumer base, Ross-
Lee believes Bill Cosby was "on to something" when he criticized 
blacks for their spending habits: "Instead of making alcohol companies 
rich, we should be building economic and educational opportunities 
community-wide in a significant way." The church, he argues, must be a 
vehicle for constructive change. 

Ross-Lee echoes Hen[} Louis Gates' idea of "two black Americas." 
To Ross-Lee, the dozen black churches in Greater New Haven do not 
bode weU for the community. They are indicative of "the fragmentation 
of the black communit}•" along socioeconomic lines. "Povert}' is at 
our doorstep every Sunday," Re,·. Ross-Lee says, referring to the Soup 
Kitchen. "But po,·erty toda} has a Reaganesque meaning: People are 
poor because they're not working hard enough. Pm·erty is not about 
drugs or alcohol or abuse anymore, but about personal responsibility. 
We as a black community have bought into this." 

In 2003, Ross-Lee began asking Immanuel church-goers every 
Sunday to leave five do!Jars in a special donation box for the United 
Negro Co!Jege Fund (UNCF). After the first year of this project, 
Immanuel Baptist had raised $30,000 for UNCF. "If every one did this," 
Ross-Lee says with a smile, "pretty soon [Yale Uni,·ersity Prestdent) 
Rick Levin would be at UNCF trying to borrow money." 

A pillar of the New J Iaven black communi(}•, Immanuel is 
beginning to suffer from an institutional inertia. In the words of its 
pastor, the church is "old, traditional and slow-moving." Its history 
has left the congregation "self-satisfied." But, Ross-Lee recognizes 
his responsibility to "shake (the church) from that complacency," 
a task he takes on in his Sunda} sermons. "He that overcometh 
shall inherit all things," booms Rev. Ross-Lee from the pulpit, as he 
urges his church to once again become a bridge between New Havcn's 
privileged and its poor, a buttress of unity in the black ~_ommunit)', not 
a barrier to it. ...
