The Yale-New Haven and Area Schools program allows exceptional high school students to take college courses at Yale for credit.  Savana, a high school senior, thrived in a Yale documentary film class, surprising her classmates with her high school status.  Other students, like Eric and Chris, also found the experience rewarding, challenging yet ultimately enriching.  The program fostered a more realistic view of Yale students, dispelling the "genius" myth and positively influencing their college application decisions.  However, even these high-achieving students faced the challenges of underclassmen status, highlighting the competitiveness of higher education.
