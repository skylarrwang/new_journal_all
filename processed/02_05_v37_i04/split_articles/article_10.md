Outsider's 
Insider 
MINUTES FROM NEW HAVEN, BEVERLY KAYE 
has set up her own new haven-for the most 
marginalized and polemicized artwork being 
produced. Her slightly unkempt front yard 
bears little resemblance to the picturesque 
pruned lawns of her Woodbridge neighbors. A 
burnished metal sculpture of tendrils twisting 
into a knot momentarily diverts the attention 
of passing drivers. At the bottom of the 
driveway, sits another metal sculpture. It is of 
a folksy Native American, welcoming visitors, 
pulling them away from suburban Connecticut 
and into the world of "Outsider Art." 

As Kaye admits, attempting to define 
the genre is to venture onto shaky ground. 
Outsider Art includes self-taught, folk and 
visionary art. In general, though, work deemed 
Outsider Art shares certain characteristics. It is 
free from overt social and cultural influences, 
artistic or otherwise; it is often created by 
self-taught individuals living on the fringe of 
society; it possesses an intensity of expression; 
and most importantly, it is driven by a desire to 
create rather than sell. 

This last stipulation presents a conundrum 
for Kaye, who sells Outsider Art without 
the blessing of outsider artists. As the genre has 
emerged, dealers and agents have adopted 
various tactics to explain this apparent paradox. 
When Scottie Wilson, an acclaimed outsider 
artist of the mid-20th century, surprised critics 
by attending an opening of his work at a New 
York art gallery, his agent felt compelled to 
issue this disclaimer: "Yes, Scottie Wilson 
was at the opening. But he wasn't there for 
the art; he was there for the whiskey." Kaye, 
however, takes a different approach. "It's 
almost impossible to be truly isolated in this 
century," she says. "Most of my artists are very 
aware that their work is being sold, but would 
be doing it even if that wasn't the case." 

Unlike many dealers who operate out 
of their homes, Kaye's living space is her art 
space. A showroom, peppered with an array 
of paintings and sculptures, blends seamlessly 
into the kitchen, which is adorned with several 
pieces by the artists Kaye represents. The 
dining room table doubles as a display area. 
Unframed drawings emerge from underneath 
an upstairs bed. "Most private dealers work 
out of their homes," Kaye says. "If people 
see the art they want to buy in a home setting, 
buying art seems more doable." 

In addition to aesthetic concerns, Kaye 
cites financial motivations for using her home 
as her gallery. "It is very much tied into the 
stock market," she says. "It's not something 
anyone needs--it's something people want." 
By relieving herself from the burden of rent 
of a commercial showroom, Kaye has a little 
immunity from the financial fluctuations that 
plague many gallery owners. 

Outsider artists are linked to each other 
mainly by the motivations driving their work. 
Although their art contains a shared intensity, 
outsider artists use a variety of techniques and 
mediums. "Many of these artists strive to create 
alternative universes," Kaye says. For outsider 
artist Gilles Manero, vintage records bought 
at a flea market become canvases upon which 
he paints vaguely demonic fairy tales. Anthony 
Guyther appalled art collectors by destroying 
valuable 18th and 19th century engravings and 
reassembling them into homoerotic collages. 
Unfortunately for Guyther, the collages 
became so popular that Bergdorf Goodman 
began using them in its window displays. He 
glues together seashells and seaweed from 
the New England coastline; and sells them in 
gift shops. On the wall in Kaye's dining room, 
a painting by Maurice Hansen Jr. reveals a 
hierarchy ranking everyone from God-as a
