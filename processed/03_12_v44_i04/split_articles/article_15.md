said. Most MBA candidates “are not 
going to use accounting in their real-
world profession. I was able to say, 
‘I’m going to need to know how to 
balance my books.’ ” 
In the summer of 2009, Inwald 
put twenty thousand dollars of his 
own money into testing his fast-food 
grilled cheese concept at county fairs. 
The enthusiastic responses convinced 
investors, and his first restaurant, then 
called Grilled Cheese to Go, opened 
that November—the same one I 
visited in the Connecticut Post Mall. 
He has since changed his company’s 
name to the catchier Cheeseboy, and 
has added six more locations across 
southern New England and New 
York.

The 
School 
of 
Management 
is 
not 
the 
only 
Yale 
institution 
that 
supported Inwald in his self-
directed business endeavors. 
In 2009, while most of his 
first-year 
MBA 
classmates 
went looking for summer 
internships and jobs, he went 
looking 
for 
entrepreneurial 
opportunities. He didn’t think 
Yale had a strong or diverse 
entrepreneurial culture, but he 
did find the recently established 
Yale Entrepreneurial Institute, which 
took him on as a fellow, introduced 
him to investors, and helped him to 
plan the county fair tests.

Inwald said he is indebted to 
YEI. But according to James Boyle, 
the institute’s director, Inwald also 
brought about a “sea change” for 
the institute, which had previously 
focused on technological innovation. 
“Cheeseboy,” Boyle said, “was the 
first venture that we ran across in an 
area that no one on the staff knew 
anything about.” Inwald’s bread and 
butter wasn’t hardware or software. It 
was bread and butter.

YEI was created in 2007 as a 
subordinate branch of the Yale Office 
of Cooperative Research in order 
to do for students what OCR was 
already doing for faculty: “technology 
transfer” from academic research to 
patentable and marketable products 
and services. Inwald, Boyle said, 
“made us realize that we had to expand 
our thinking toward students who had 
innovative ideas for which there might 
be no intellectual property protection, 
based upon the strength of how they 
executed the idea.” Since Inwald’s 
involvement at YEI, the institute has 
offered opportunities to similarly 
offbeat would-be start-ups.

While Inwald is happy to know 
that he has opened doors to younger 
Yale entrepreneurs, he does not think 
entrepreneurship is right for everyone. 
said. “When it came time to talk to 
professional investors and they asked 
questions about the business model, 
Michael could really blow them away.” 
Boyle says Inwald is also exceptional 
in that he wants to remain the sole 
proprietor of Cheeseboy. “We think 
that’s way too much work for one 
student to take on.”

As 
Cheeseboy 
has 
grown, 
Inwald has worked hard to shape the 
institutional identity of the company 
according to his values. He visits all 
of the seven Cheeseboy locations 
at least once a month, he said, and 
the young man who served me in 
Milford confirmed that Inwald jumps 
in alongside his employees, making 
sandwiches or taking out the trash. 
Cheeseboy is growing, and 
will soon enter the very different 
business of franchising new 
locations instead of operating 
them directly, but Inwald insists 
that it will “grow intelligently.” 
It’s hard to imagine that this 
company that bears its founder’s 
nickname, even as its employee 
count crosses into the hundreds, 
will lose either his personal 
warmth or his business savvy.

In a few weeks, that original 
Milford Cheeseboy will close, to 
be replaced by a new one in a nearby 
service plaza on I-95. The young guy 
who made my sandwich told me he 
and his colleagues would move to the 
new location.

Maybe I’ll visit him, brave 
another tired American nowhere for 
the goo and crunch and warmth of a 
high-quality grilled cheese sandwich. 
At the very least, as I drive down 
I-95, I’ll think of Inwald, and of 
the time, work, and sheer willpower 
entrepreneurship 
requires. 
Who 
knew? It takes a whole lot to make it 
in America, even if America is one big 
food court.

“I don’t think anyone should just get 
into entrepreneurship for the sake 
of getting into entrepreneurship,” 
Inwald said. “This is not an easy task. 
Entrepreneurship is the antithesis of 
stability.” A true entrepreneur, in his 
view, would never complain about 
time commitment: such a person 
would find a way to learn the necessary 
skills, either through formal education 
or through professional experience.

Boyle said that Inwald was 
unusually ready to meet the challenges 
of entrepreneurship. “He had no 
background in fast food, real estate, 
franchising, but Michael understood 
at a very fine detail the costs of 
all his inputs and outputs,” Boyle
