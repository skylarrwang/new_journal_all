**Bagging a Whitetail**

Bagging 
a 
whitetail 
takes 
thorough knowledge of the animal. 
Joe places his tree stands by bedding 
areas or above well-used tracks. He 
learns the routines and habits of 
specific animals. On this Sunday in 
November, the deer, he told me, 
should have spent the night hunkered 
down seeking warmth in the valleys 
and by the inland bodies of water, 
moving upland with dawn for browse. 
We had to be in position before the 
deer entered the woods about us.


Joe, one of his nephews, and I 
ripped through the forest on ATVs, 
over logs and steep hillsides, and then 
tramped through the unevenly frozen 
swamp to our posts. By sunrise the 
three of us were high in the branches, 
each about two hundred yards away 
from the other two.


I ran through Joe’s words of 
advice in my head. Even the best 
book, I realized, can’t replace the field 
presence of a man standing by your 
side who knows his gun, the beast, 
and the terrain. New hunters need to 
find experienced guides.


Lafon, who learned to hunt 
from his father, had told me that he 
has seen the demand for mentors 
from aspiring hunters. “It’s almost 
like you need a match system, and 
we’ve actually thought about that,” 
he said. Lafon would like to attach 
urbanized locavores to traditional 
hunters, education flowing both 
ways, 
locavorism 
exchanged 
for 
hunting skills. He has begun talking 
with Landers about launching a 
state-sponsored version of Landers’ 
locavore hunting course, which was 
offered for the last time this fall. 
Lafon thinks Landers would make a 
good ambassador for both locavores 
and hunters. It is in Landers’s favor, 
Lafon said, that Landers is a Virginian. 
The co-education Lafon hopes for is 
tied, just as locavorism is, to place 
identity. After all, I think as I wait in 
the predawn, Joe wouldn’t have taken 
me under his wing if I hadn’t been a 
part of West Park.


My tree grew at the edge of 
the hardwoods. Beyond this margin, 
which runs from east to west for a 
several miles, softwood saplings spring 
up from thick frozen grasses where 
loggers had sliced off the forest a few 
years earlier. Deer like these margin 
areas. I was perfectly placed.


As the morning progressed, I 
heard a few songbirds and squirrels, 
and some sporadic gunshots from 
across the bowl, but none of the soft, 
crisp rustles that characterize a deer’s 
delicate browsing pace. After six hours 
spent watching the sun follow the 
moon across the sky, I had not seen a 
single deer and had not spent a single 
bullet (other than the one I dropped 
from the tree stand in the dark, along 
with my hat). None of us had. 


Two days later, I was sitting 
by Union Square in Manhattan 
with John Durant, one of Lander’s 
former 
students, 
28-year-old 
former management consultant who 
is writing a manual for living like a 
modern hunter-gatherer. Durant had 
shot his first deer three weeks earlier. 
It was a yearling, yielding about thirty-
five pounds of venison. It had been 
a clean shot and the beast was dead 
within ten seconds. Durant had been 
delicate at first in slicing it open—but 
soon realized his hands needed to get 
dirty to get the job done. The beast 
was warm and the air cold, Durant 
said. It had been the same with my 
squirrel. Warm organs do not feel like 
meat. Durant said that he expected the 
venison would last him a few months 
into the new year. 


Over coffee, Durant and I 
traded stories. We laughed at how the 
experienced hunters had teased him 
for being so green, and for his small 
deer. He leaned forward to talk about 
holistic solutions to the physical and 
ethical problems of modern life. I told 
him all that I had learned through my 
own education and research. Hunting 
is a tradition and knowledge should be 
shared.


Young 
people 
who 
looked 
like New York University students 
sat at the tables around us. I don’t 
know how we sounded to them, or 
if they were planning to try venison 
themselves anytime soon. Suddenly, 
it felt important for me to know how 
serious I was about what I had done—
and would do. 


I had committed myself to 
hunting in the moment when I worked 
through my first squirrel’s death. I had 
seen, riding behind Joe on his ATV as 
he yelled about loggers clearing the 
forest, that his care for the land was 
as genuine as any naturalist’s. Between 
two people who care so much, there 
is an opportunity for a conversation 
that crosses political and cultural 
boundaries.


Whatever Durant, I, and others 
like us become will likely remain a 
small subculture. Durant will reach 
into the freezer chest in his Manhattan 
apartment, I’ll return to West Park for 
more squirrels this spring, and friends 
will eat our meals. Locavore hunters 
could have, as Landers said, an impact 
far larger than our numbers might 
suggest. 


Joe had told me that I could think 
of hunting as going out to the garden 
to pull carrots. But the two are not the 
same. In hunting, you put yourself 
behind another’s eyes—and it seems 
to me that we could use this more 
complete, and more complicated, 
perspective.


If you take to hunting, give me 
a call. We’ll invite everyone we know 
to dinner.
