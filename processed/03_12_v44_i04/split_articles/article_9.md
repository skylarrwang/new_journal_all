where the ant colony is situated, 
noticed the fungus diminishing in size 
and expressed concern for the queen’s 
health.  
Leaf-cutter ants form the largest, 
most complex societies on earth, next 
to our own. Rival kingdoms in the 
Peabody’s Discovery Room—which 
include poison dart frogs from South 
America and thumb-sized hissing 
cockroaches from Madagascar—do 
not compare. Leaf-cutters belong 
to some of the oldest agricultural 
societies on earth, cultivating fungal 
gardens in finely tuned reciprocity. 
Fungal 
complexes 
have 
been 
discovered in the ants’ native tropics 
that are five hundred square feet in 
area and reach twenty-six feet below 
the ground, dimensions that, taking 
into account our much larger size, 
make the Great Wall of China look 
like a garden fence. 
Leaf-cutters appear to have 
unanimously adopted monarchism as 
their preferred form of government. 
Their entire social hierarchy is 
organized according to a simple 
principle. Size determines occupation, 
lifestyle, and every other quality an 
ant might wish to claim. The largest 
ants protect the nest from invaders. 
Middling castes include the foragers 
and the soldiers who protect them 
as they cut scraps of leaves and haul 
them back to the garden in orderly 
columns. The smallest care for the 
brood of larvae or attend, like ladies-
in-waiting, upon the queen, who 
continually produces eggs throughout 
her life.  The members of all of 
these castes are female, infertile, and 
dwarfed in size by the queen.  As with 
Abraham Lincoln or Lyndon Johnson, 
both six-foot-four, physical stature 
correlates with political power, and—
for ant queens—size is something one 
is born into.  
The old fungal garden in the 
Peabody, presided over by the now 
deceased and ever-unnamed queen, 
was, at its largest, about the size of a 
basketball. Built on top of hydrostone, 
a porous sculpting cement, the grayish-
green 
fungal 
garden—suggestive 
of moldy Swiss cheese—grew and 
shrank with the population of the ants 
and its own life cycle.  The ants are 
always carrying away dying fungus and 
bringing new leaf material to fertilize 
the garden. It is hard to see what the 
ants are doing inside the garden, but 
a long tube runs across the room to 
the leaf pile, supplied by New Haven 
trees, rosebushes, and other foliage. 
Visitors, especially children, enjoy 
watching the ants trundle back and 
forth with their jagged loads.


Without the queen, the whole 
colony must die. In captivity, a queen 
cannot lay reproductive eggs and 
ensure her succession. In the tropics, a 
queen begins her adult life with wings, 
flies up once, and mates in the air. 
During the nuptial flight, fertile males 
from many colonies rise to meet her in 
an aerial orgy. 
Once the queen is fertilized—
with up to 300 million sperm—she 
leaves her lovers, who promptly die, 
and returns to the ground. There, 
she loses her wings and burrows 
deep beneath the rainforest soil. First 
though, she stores a bit of fungus in 
her mouth to provide the first few 
spores for her colony. 
Though queens in the wild can 
live up to twenty years, conditions 
in captivity vary greatly, affecting 
the queens’ reproductive ability and 
Queen Victoria of England ruled 
for sixty-three years, seven months 
and two days before her death in 1901.  
In accordance with her meticulous 
instructions, the queen’s body was 
dressed in a white gown and her 
wedding veil, and beside her were 
placed the stipulated photographs, 
locks of hair, and a plaster cast of the 
hand of Prince Albert. On February 
2, her coffin was borne through the 
streets of London on a gun carriage. 
With perhaps less fanfare, after a 
reign of four years, another queen, in 
a kingdom on Whitney Avenue, was 
recently borne from her deathbed by 
a pair of forceps.   
The queen of the Yale Peabody 
Museum’s leaf-cutter ant colony is 
no more. Her death in late October 
would have gone unnoticed, says 
the discoverer of the body and the 
Peabody’s education coordinator, Jim 
Sirch, but for the gradual decline of 
the colony’s population. He noticed 
the size of the population stagnate 
and then fall about a month before 
her death was confirmed in the fall. 
It is hard, he explained, to quantify 
ants in the intricate, secretive, and 
microcosmic fungal garden they 
inhabit and cultivate. Staff, students, 
and visitors to the Discovery Room,

life cycles. The life and death of this 
queen was, to some degree, shrouded 
in mystery. The museum staff does 
not know whether she took ill or 
whether she was poisoned but they are 
not extremely perturbed, despite the 
effort it takes to get a new queen and 
painstakingly coax forth a vibrant new 
colony. Sirch has obtained a young 
queen and her foundling colony from 
the Boston Museum of Science, 
which, in turn, acquired them from 
the rainforest of Costa Rica.  
The new queen will rule over a 
growing population of ants and the 
burgeoning fungal garden in which 
her subjects harmoniously reside—
now the size of several stacked kitchen 
sponges. This new kingdom has been 
placed in a plastic container near the 
dying one on display in the Discovery 
Room. The old queen will likely be 
forgotten by all but the entomology 
department, 
which 
houses 
her 
remains.
Sirch had watched the queen’s 
slowing activity for several weeks as 
he stole glimpses of her through an 
opening in the garden. Movement that 
for some time he took for the queen’s 
was in fact only the stirrings of her 
ladies-in-waiting. Eventually, Sirch 
used forceps to pull out the queen, the 
size of a small mouse. She was dead.

**Title: Stopping the Presses**
**Page number(s): 5-6**

Stopping the 
Presses
1981. The New Haven Register 
moved from a small office on Orange 
and Audobon to 40 Sargent Drive, 
a former shirt factory. Busloads of 
people came to tour the new state-
of-the-art Goss Metroliner printing 
presses. New Haven was the industry 
showroom. Rockwell International, 
the company that manufactured Goss 
Metroliners, featured the Register’s 
pressmen on the cover of its 1982 
catalogue with the headline “Winning 
Team in New Haven.” In the picture, 
you can see the men’s reflections in 
the gleaming floors.
Today, the floors are black and 
slippery, covered in ink. According 
to the Register’s press manager, Frank 
Malicki, 
the 
custodians 
stopped 
cleaning the floors about three or four 
years ago, which is how he knew the 
Journal Register East Company (the 
Register’s corporate owner, known 
as the JRC) would close down the 
printing press. “How did I know? 
The same thing happened on Orange 
Street.” Thirty-odd jobs at the press 
will be outsourced to the Hartford 
Courant’s plant over the course of four 
weeks. The press’s last run will be 
on March 4. Malicki started working 
for the Register as a sixteen-year-old 
delivery boy in 1970. When I asked 
him about the future, he said, “I don’t 
know. I need a job.”
This closure is one more sign 
of the transition from print to 
digital media, which has thrown the 
traditional news industry into chaos. 
But the Register has been struggling 
for a long time. Since the Jackson 
brothers, Richard and Lionel, sold 
the newspaper in 1986, there have 
been three corporate takeovers, a 
bankruptcy filing, and dozens of 
layoffs. 
The 
200,000-square-foot 
building at 40 Sargent Drive is now 
mostly empty. Last August, the trouble 
also affected editorial management. 
Longtime editor Jack Kramer, a thirty-
year veteran, was replaced by Matt 
DeRienzo.
Now, according to Paul Bass, the 
editor of the New Haven Independent, the 
Register “is at the forefront of trying 
to re-invent for-profit journalism.” 
Digital journalism is the paper’s long-
term strategy. In 2010, the newspaper 
gave every reporter a video camera. In 
addition, DeRienzo wants the paper 
to interact with an empowered online 
readership. He answers questions on 
online forums. As publisher of the 
Torrington Register Citizen, he invited the 
public to editorial meetings, which he 
streamed online through a live video 
feed. He also supervised the paper’s 
move to a downtown location that 
is both newsroom and coffee shop, 
a place where the public can interact 
with reporters as they work. DeRienzo 
hopes to make similar changes at the 
Register. 
Closing the press will allow 
the Register to focus its resources on 
expanding its online presence. Bobby 
Suraci, the shift manager, estimates 
that lighting the press alone costs 
$20,000 a month. Add the costs of 
paper, ink, manpower, and plates, 
and printing becomes incredibly 
expensive, to the tune of $975,000 a 
year. 
Although DeRienzo is the public 
face of the digital transition at the 
Register, he did not know what day 
the press would close, its location in 
the building, or whether any of the 
pressmen had jobs lined up.  “A lot of 
people in the front have never even 
come back here,” Suraci said. “They’re 
a few doors away and they have no 
idea we’re back here.” 
This separation between the 
newsroom and the pressroom is not 
unique to the Register, but it is difficult 
to ignore in light of the press’s 
imminent closure. The paper’s new 
editor is looking toward the future and 
is less concerned with the history of 
the business. At the time of writing, 
only one other person had visited 
the presses. When I asked DeRienzo


about historical records, he jokingly 
answered, “Your article!” 
The press is huge. It cuts through 
three floors and extends roughly 
the length of a football field. It is 
incredibly loud, forcing everyone to 
shout to be heard; it makes the floor 
vibrate and it is fast. When I visited, 
it was churning out forty thousand 
papers an hour, a visual whir. The 
future of this particular press, once 
the pride of the Register, is unknown. 
“I hope I’m wrong,” Malicki said, “but 
they’ll probably scrap it for metal.” 
	

In 
accordance 
with 
Connecticut law, the paper’s publisher 
notified the state of the imminent 
layoff of 105 employees. DeRienzo 
estimates that roughly seventy-five 
of them are part-time or short-term 
employees who work in the mailroom 
or in delivery. The others are the 
pressmen, the electricians, the plate-
makers, and the machinists. They 
stand to lose the most.
Malicki has stories. He remembers 
how Lionel Jackson would send him 
down the street to deliver ten thousand 
dollars in cash, and he remembers a 
catastrophic ink spill that left stains 
on the walls still visible today. Suraci 
started working one year after Malicki, 
in 1971. “I need health benefits,” 
Suraci said. “If it wasn’t for that, I’d 
take severance and unemployment 
and try to ride it out.” Many of the 
younger men have families to support 
and need to find work immediately.
State law is supposed to give 
communities a chance to deal with 
layoffs, but it has had no effect on 
the Register’s pressmen. A few will stay 
behind until May to decommission 
the press, which seems to mean 
scrubbing out all of the ink that has 
accumulated over the years. According 
to Suraci, two men have jobs lined 
up in Hartford. The rest are putting 
out résumés and going to interviews. 
The likelihood of finding more 
printing work is grim. “Will I go into 
the printing business? Probably not, 
’cause it’s a dying business,” Suraci 
said. “It’s the end of an era for us. It’s 
sad in a way, but you can see how the 
future is going.” 
	

Like the reporters in the 
newsroom, these men have been 
watching that future apprehensively 
for years as technology and the 
industry have changed. When Malicki 
started, the presses were still using lead 
plates, and there were over seventy 
men working in the pressroom, one 
for every unit. The Register sold its 
second printing press in the late 1990’s, 
and Suraci explained that the papers 
are now barely half their former 
width—down from sixty-four inches 
to the current standard of thirty-four 
inches—to save money. The paper 
storage room has never had any extra 
space, until now. The Register is trying 
to use up its inventory.
On one of the walls in the 
pressroom, the men have tacked up 
lists of all the printing presses that 
have closed in the United States 
since 2005. (According to Frank, 
the number is 120 since 2009.) One 
pressman scrawled, “WHO CARES?” 
Another pressman said, “We’re all 
dinosaurs.” I asked him about his 
plans in four weeks. He laughed. “Go 
to Disney World!”
