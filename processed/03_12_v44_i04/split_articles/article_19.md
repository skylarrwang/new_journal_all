sexuality. Sexuality masters us. The 
only remedies are conventions that 
restrain our sexuality—monogamy 
and marriage, to name two. Such 
institutions don’t constrain us, rather, 
they form a new version of human 
freedom—the freedom from our 
brutish desires. That’s why there are 
two rings at the bottom of posters for 
Better Yale’s “True Love Week.” 
Better Yale puts forward an 
aspirational, almost transcendental 
vision of sexuality, in which sex is 
sublimated into a kind of platonic 
ideal. Better Yale’s organizers will freely 
admit it’s an unlikely and impracticable 
vision. Sex Week, on the other hand, 
starts from the view that sex is simply 
a fact of human nature. “Sex simply 
is,” as Peters phrases it. And another 
fact Sex Week emphasizes is that 1 in 4 
women will become victims of sexual 
assualt in their collegiate career.


Too many victims have suffered 
from unsupportive institutions and 
an indifferent campus culture for me 
to take seriously Better Yale’s obvious 
longing for “simpler” times. Still, 
Better Yale’s members make one very 
important point.

For every student who undertakes 
the sincere and earnest reflection 
incumbent upon those who enjoy 
the openness of our current sexual 
climate, there will be someone else 
who does not. Alex Chituc made this 
point in the News in a column under 
the headline “Yalies for Minding 
Your Own Business.” In a campus 
of five thousand undergraduates, he 
argued, there are bound to be “a few 
assholes.” Some will viciously exploit a 
permissive sexual climate, just because 
they can. 

In the last thirty years, the 
percentage of students who exhibit 
some narcissistic traits has doubled, 
according to a survey of sixteen 
thousand undergraduates by a San 
Diego State University psychology 
research team. The traits included 
vanity, a heightened desire for attention, 
and a lack of empathy. A group of 
University of Michigan researchers 
found that empathy among college 
students had declined by 40 percent 
since 1980, as determined by how 
likely study participants were to agree 
with “I sometimes try to understand 
my friends better by imagining how 
things look from their perspective” 
and similar statements.


At the heart of Better Yale’s 
worldview is the pessimistic thought 
that there’s something fundamentally 
narcissistic about sex. According to 
Bijan Aboutorabi ’13, one of Better 
Yale’s co-founders, “With the idea of 
hookup culture that we’re all just free-
floating sexual agents, meeting briefly, 
then moving on, it’s almost inevitable 
that the desire for private satisfaction 
will overcome respect for the sexual 
autonomy of others.” Emphasizing 
desire and personal satisfaction will 
not bring autonomy and meaning to 
our lives, claims Better Yale. Rather, it 
will invite sexual violence.

I put this question to Holmes, 
who said that narcissism is “a 
symptom of our general inability to 
communicate.” It is “a bar to genuine 
reflection,” he added.

After all, there’s more to sexual 
health than self-love. Discussing and 
understanding your own desires can 
help you to communicate with your 
sexual partners, and it can give you the 
strength to demand respect. However, 
as students and administrators, we 
must also condemn forcefully those 
students who violate others. Knowing 
what you want is important. Knowing 
what we all want—knowing how to 
protect sexual safety on campus—is 
also important, and requires a firmer 
standard beyond our own desires.

And for that, we have to talk 
about sex.
