EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
My whole body quivered, thrilled 
with horror. I nearly cried. I wondered 
at how senselessly I had ended her 
game. I stared through the canopy, 
the trees all breathing and swaying. 
The birds had gone silent with the 
gunshot. Would this be the moment, 
I asked myself, that I would remember 
in the future as my conversion to 
vegetarianism? I could see the furry 
hind of the dead squirrel but the 
thought of touching it made me feel 
ill. The Hudson River glittered calmly 
behind the trees. 

I couldn’t tell if my shaking was 
from endorphins, shock, or the cold. 
I was stuck in the metal stand, waiting 
because Joe had told me to, but also 
because I wanted to make sure that 
the squirrel wouldn’t still be alive 
when I descended, and I had nothing 
to do but sit in the sky and think over 
what I had done.
Killing this creature only felt 
tragic because I had witnessed its 
death. I don’t see the meat that lives 
as poorly as it dies. This squirrel lived 
wild and now it would be eaten—and 
that was good. 

The following hour was quiet, as 
the sun passed over the hill and the 
woods seemed to age, turning grey 
and amber. My shadow lay across the 
groundcover, enflamed by the falling 
sun.  I listened for more squirrels. 
There are hours when the squirrels are 
loud and hours when they are quiet. 
When they feel bold, the animals can 
make as much noise as a child crashing 
through deadfall. Other times only 
the uncanny twitch of a leaf reveals 
their progress across a branch. Over 
the next hour, a quiet one, I pinned 
three more squirrels in my crosshairs, 
hesitated, and lost them. A deer leapt 
down the western banks, moving 
south with the wind. It was growing 
far colder and my hands on the rifle 
were white, blue, and green. It was 
time to dress my kill.
A squirrel is adorable in death. 
Its fur is soft, features delicate, and 
eyes cracked as if it were just sinking 
into a doze. Only a bubble of blood at 
the nostrils and the red exit and entry 
wounds show its trauma. Outside my 
great aunt’s house, I set up my squirrel 
on a board and swigged from a bottle 
of Hudson River Valley whiskey. I 
started by clipping off the feet. When 
you press in the tendons by a squirrel’s 
feet, the toes curl in, just as they do 
in limp human wrists, and I dropped 
the thing with a cry when its claws 
unexpectedly scraped my latex-gloved 
hand. With scissors I then snipped 
through the skin across the abdomen 
and up its belly, gripped the fur and 
started to peel back. Joe had told me 
that it would feel like I was undressing 
the squirrel, but it didn’t. It took strong 
pulling, and I had to push my fingers 
between her warm abdomen and her 
hide, though I did slide her leg stumps 
out from her furred sleeves as if they 
were the ends of a winter parka. This 
was almost a bloodless process, since 
the body is encased in muscle. She was 
nearly meat.
The body peeled, I chopped 
off the squirrel’s tail and head and 
discarded them with the feet. I sliced 
a line below and then up between 
her ribs, cutting away the diaphragm 
and then the tissue connecting the 
heart and lungs to the chest cavity. I 
set those organs aside. I then pulled 
out her gastro-intestinal tract, whole, 
because puncturing the guts would 
release bacteria. Cutting through the 
joints, I divided the carcass into six 
cuts: four legs and an upper and lower 
torso. These I put inside, into the 
freezer, where any germs would die in 
a few hours.
The next morning, before dawn, 
I returned to my post. As the sun 
rose, above grasses and leaves lined 
with frost, I listened for the wakening 
forest. A turkey clucked. Hawk-sized 
Pileated Woodpeckers watched the 
forest floor from the highest limbs of 
a dead oak with far keener eyes than 
mine. The sun rose over the Hudson, 
shining in one amber track across its 
waters, slipping gold trails between the 
maples. The squirrels began to chatter. 
I took one out in the first twenty 
minutes with a perfect shot. I waited 
for my third squirrel. 

I watched with my ears, because 
the story of the woods is in every 
sound. The chickadees tentatively 
warming their throats, the tiny 
songbirds 
sparrowing 
through the thorny brush, the hisses 
of squirrels speaking to one another. 
These noises, ebbing and flowing with 
the wind, ceased when a hawk flew 
overhead and after a six-point buck 
strode boldly through the valley.
I missed the third squirrel’s 
shoulder, hitting the middle of his 
torso. He ran behind a tree and bled 
there for half an hour. I climbed 
down out of the stand and flushed 
him further into the woods where he 
ran onto a log at the crest of a small 
hillock and lay there watching me. 
I walked up, carefully took a sitting 
position fifteen feet away, speaking 
gently aloud to the squirrel, and then 
shot. Without the elevated view of 
the tree stand, I couldn’t see where 
he landed, and, despite a systematic 
search, couldn’t recover his body. 
I couldn’t use the second squirrel 
either. I had waited too long, several 
hours, to field-dress, and after too 
much time cooling, the meat was no 
good. I felt terrible, irresponsible and 
reckless. Still, I would eat what I had 
butchered the night before


**Title: EATING MEAT**
**Page number(s): 41**

A 
stew is only as good as its 
foundations. I seared my squirrel, 
deglazed the pan, and then braised the 
meat in chicken stock. After nearly 
three hours I put in caramelized carrots 
and squash, and potatoes, celery and 
barley. I pulled out the bones and 
removed the lid to cook down the 
base, adding pinches of rosemary and 
thyme. The kitchen smelled of grease, 
woody herbs, and fermented fruit. I 
served my housemates and each of us 
went back for more. 

When we put away our dishes, 
there remained the lava-pink heart 
and lungs, still tied to each other. I 
prepared a frying pan and slapped the 
tight bundle on top of sizzling butter, 
coating each side with brown sugar as 
it cooked. A cut through the muscle 
and lung split the organs into two 
equal parts. Travis took one half on 
the end of a fork, and I took the other. 
It tasted like a cross between French 
toast and kidneys. 

The next time I prepared meat 
for dinner, a few weeks later, it was 
venison that Joe had shot that season. 
Uncooked deer, unlike squirrel (or 
any other meat I’ve ever seen), carries 
a dark purple color and has the 
taste of root vegetables. I marinated 
the venison cutlets in whiskey and 
mustard and grilled them outside in 
the cold December night. No steak 
or chop has ever tasted so good and 
hearty to me as that deer, flavorful, 
tender, and lean.
As I smeared the venison with 
marinade, I thought of Jackson 
Landers, the Virginian author of 
The Beginner’s Guide to Deer Hunting for 
Food, who, before he started hunting, 
would not touch raw meat. Landers, 
33, was raised a vegetarian but began 
eating meat as an adult. He would 
manipulate his raw meat from a 
distance with utensils. “I decided,” 
Landers explained, “that if I couldn’t 
handle the reality of this meat, I 
should confront where the meat was 
coming from.” So he decided to hunt, 
kill, butcher, and eat a deer. 

Landers spent years educating 
himself from college studies and 
textbooks about the natural history 
of deer and firearms. He spent 
hours watching the animals and 
shot hundreds of rounds a week in 
practice. He now hunts all his meat. 
With his bare hands, Landers has 
butchered armadillo, an animal that 
carries leprosy.

As soon as he asked, in July 2009 
on his blog “The Locavore Hunter,” 
if readers were interested in attending 
a workshop class on locavore hunting, 
Landers became the Northeast’s de-
facto spokesperson for environmental 
and food-focused hunting. Since then 
Landers has taught New Yorkers how 
to cook Canada geese culled from 
Brooklyn’s Prospect Park and has 
written a second book, Eating Aliens, 
which advocates fighting invasive 
species by consuming them. 

When I spoke with him over 
the phone late one night, he had just 
ended a long day stalking boar in 
Texas hill country. Landers told me 
that, other than a school in Texas 
(that he was currently visiting) whose 
curriculum was modeled after his 
own, he knew of no other hunter’s 
science and butchery courses besides 
his own. The Virginian estimated that 
he has taught 150 to 300 people the 
basics of locavore hunting over the 
last three years—and his book is now 
reaching thousands more.
Landers wrote Deer Hunting for 
Food for the same kind of people 
who enrolled in his courses, educated 
people largely between the ages of 
25 and 45, most coming from the 
metropolitan areas around New York 
City and Washington, DC. Landers 
taught several former vegetarians and 
even a practicing vegan who makes 
exceptions for wild game, he told me. 
Nelson Lafon, Deer Project 
Coordinator 
with 
the 
Virginia 
Department of Game and Inland 
Fisheries, welcomes the new hunters. 
Virginia and the Northeast need them, 
he told me, because the region has 
become severely overpopulated with 
whitetail deer. The deer population, 
which has been increasing for seventy 
years, surpassed a healthy size in the 
1990s, just as numbers of hunters 
began decreasing nationwide, Lafon 
explained. This season the state issued 
twenty percent fewer hunting licenses 
than it had fifteen years ago. The deer 
are starving, competing for food in 
populated areas and, no longer car-
shy, causing fatal accidents.
Lafon would like to see hunters 
take to the wooded pockets of semi-
urban communities. Archery presents 
less danger in close quarters, and 
Lafon thinks urbanites could use 
bows in their own backyards. I asked 
him what the least amount of land 
is on which a person can hunt deer. 
“I hate to say there is a minimum, 
especially if the hunter works with 
neighbors,” he told me. Lafon also 
told me that he does not fear over-
hunting because the state ultimately 
controls both the number of licenses 
distributed and the number of deer 
permitted per license each season. In 
the last two decades both Virginians 
and New Yorkers have been taking 
between 200,000 and 250,000 deer 
per state per season—and, if Lafon 
is right, they could be taking perhaps 
thousands more. Two good-sized deer 
could yield more than 150 pounds of 
venison combined, enough to last a 
single locavore hunter a year. 

When I took to the woods again, 
this time for deer, I felt good knowing 
that it served an ecological purpose—
and that I might come away with 
enough meat for months. 


**Title: THE HUNT**

T
he second Sunday in December 
was the coldest in weeks, staying 
resolutely below freezing for most of 
the day. 

From my perch thirty feet up in 
a hardwood I could see nearly two 
hundred yards through bare tree 
trunks. The land is crumpled there, 
run through with ridges that parallel 
the Hudson. A long swamp lies about 
a mile and a half west of the river. Joe 
calls the land that cups it “the bowl,” 
and he has peppered its rim with tree 
stands. He maintains the grounds for 
the Catholic convent that owns the 
swath of land, which is two miles 
south of my family’s place. In the 
dark forest of 6 a.m., when moonlight 
touched branches and frosted grasses, 
I climbed a tall oak, settling onto a 
wooden platform nailed across an 
elbow in the tree. A hoot owl cooed 
the same meter over and over, and 
after about an hour the sun rose 
out over the mountain, sending 
fingerprints of warmth through the 
full body camouflage suit Joe had 
leant me. I cradled one of his rifles—
the smallest caliber that you can use to 
hunt deer—and tried not to fall asleep 
and off my perch. I watched for deer 
to cross from the swamp to the high 
ground covered in pines and leafless 
oaks that lay behind me. 

The deer 
population, which 
has been increasing 
for seventy 
years, surpassed 
a healthy size in 
the 1990s. The 
deer are starving, 
competing for food 
in populated areas 
and, no longer car-
shy, causing fatal 
accidents.
