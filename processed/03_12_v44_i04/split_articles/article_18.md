n the debate about sexual culture 
at Yale, everyone agrees that 
“intolerance,” 
“rape 
culture,” 
and “objectification” are bad, while 
“intimacy,” “respect,” and “love” 
are good. Both sides also agree that 
something is wrong with their school’s 
sexual culture here. So the indignant, 
supercilious tone of editorial on both 
sides isn’t a result of a difference in 
goals, but of a disagreement about 
what the problem is.

After news of the Department 
of Education’s Title IX investigation 
broke last spring, President Levin 
hosted a series of student dinner 
discussions. Eduardo Andino ’13 
attended one of them. As he described 
it to me, the discussion lacked a center 
because despite talk of “the problem” 
and various remedies—more training, 
more outreach, more publicity—“no 
one ever said what the problem was.” 
Andino and a few other students 
would later form Undergraduates 
for a Better Yale College. According 
to Better Yale, the “problem” is 
that sexual norms of intimacy and 
commitment have given way to norms 
of hedonism and objectification. This 
fall, Better Yale petitioned the school 
to bar the organizers of Sex Week 
from using its classrooms.

Courtney 
Peters 
’12 
is 
an 
executive director of Sex Week 2012. 
She sees the problem as a lack of 
creative imagination about sexuality. 

The starting point of Sex Week’s 
project is to construct new, positive 
models for sex. Making sure sex is safe 
and consensual is only half the task. 
Sex should be glorious and, as Peters 
puts it, “prismatic”—a word that 
brings to mind sex accompanied by 
choirs of cherubs wrapped in colorful 
garments.

Thirty-five 
years 
ago, 
Ann 
Olivarius and four other plaintiffs 
brought the first Title IX suit against 
a major university in Alexander v. Yale. 
She told the story during her Sex Week 
keynote speech, a story she’s told 
before in the pages of this magazine. 
In 1977, Olivarius had presented 
a series of anonymous narratives 
documenting sexual harassment by 
professors and fellow students to 
the Yale Corporation. Her group 
recommended the formation of a 
central grievance board to adjudicate 
complaints of sexual harassment. In 
response, Yale accused Olivarius of 
libeling a professor of music and band 
director, Keith Brion, named in the 
complaint. Yale further stonewalled 
when Brion began to stalk Olivarius. 
She 
received 
threatening 
mail 
including death threats, a knife, and 
human excrement. 

At the time, Olivarius told the Sex 
Week audience, it seemed like merely 
instituting a reporting mechanism 
would be enough. But a deeper 
problem lay with attitudes liable to 
result in sexual misconduct—attitudes 
of neglect or willful ignorance of 
women’s sexual needs and desires. 
An environment where partners can 
articulate and respect another’s wishes 
is the best way to prevent sexual 
misconduct. According to Olivarius, 
sexual education at Yale today is the 
natural conclusion of the argument 
that everyone should be protected 
from sexual abuse of all kinds.

One returning presenter from the 
last Sex Week in 2010 was Babeland, 
the New York-based sex boutique 
chain. Of all the material aired at Sex 
Week 2010, Babeland’s presentation 
on oral sex technique epitomized 
the thought that “education and 
excitement are not exclusive,” as Paul 
Holmes ’13 and Connie Cho ’13, 
two of Sex Week’s other executive 
directors, wrote in an editorial in the 
News.

This year, Babeland’s presenters 
began with a set of ground rules, a kind 
of Bill of Rights, for female sexuality. 
“Love yourself first” and “Ask for 
what you want” came in high on the 
list. Here was Ann Olivarius’ thesis 
made concrete. If you really want 
to stop abusive sexual practices, you 
have to teach people how to demand 
good sex. Maxims like “Love yourself 
first” may sound like the grounds for 
shallow relationships. But in light of a 
history of denying or dismissing the 
particular needs of women, “Love 
yourself first” is a revolutionary idea. 
It means the conquest of shame, or 
fear. It means that each of us, and no 
one else, is the ultimate arbiter of her 
sexuality.

At Sex Week’s core lies the 
thought that sex can be transformed 
into a liberating, empowering force 
for personal autonomy. Pleasure and 
desire can be reconciled with intimacy 
and commitment. Sex, in this narrative, 
is a fundamental feature of our 
character. Yale’s mission, moreover, 
to educate and lead students “in every 
sphere of human activity” creates a 
need for institutions like Sex Week.
