and working with people who were 
actively engaged in illicit drug use 
and not trying necessarily to change 
that behavior was quite radical,” said 
O’Keefe. “The bleach was so fraught 
with emotion. People thought: this is 
condoning drug use.” 


To those who knew the situation 
on the ground, providing syringes 
made sense. Syringe exchanges had 
started in Amsterdam, in 1984.  By 
1987, an illegal syringe distribution 
program was running in New Haven, 
the first of its kind in the United 
States. Jon Stuen-Parker, a former 
addict and a student at Yale School 
of Medicine, had started an HIV/
AIDS outreach group called the 
AIDS Brigade. With his headquarters 
in a storefront on York Street, Stuen-
Parker distributed syringes in shooting 
galleries in Boston and New Haven. 
He bought the syringes in Vermont. 
While providing needles illegally 
provided immediate relief, it was not 
an option for the Mayor’s Task Force 
on AIDS. Nor would it improve 
perceptions of syringe exchanges, in 
an age more hostile toward drug use 
than today. Myths were common: 
addicts were on suicide missions; they 
shared syringes ritualistically. 


To provide evidence for the 
utility of a syringe exchange, the 
Mayor’s Task Force had city outreach 
workers survey drug users about why 
they shared syringes. The results were 
unsurprising. Addicts were sharing 
needles because they feared arrest 
and because needles were difficult to 
buy on the streets. In the research, 
addicts also complained about drug 
treatment programs. The waitlists 
were long. There were not supportive 
services like childcare available during 
treatment. There was not enough 
rehabilitative training to remain drug-
free after treatment.  


With evidence in hand, the 
Mayor’s Task Force began a campaign 
to reform the approach to substance 
use and HIV at the state level. 
They called for AIDS education 
and outreach, decriminalization of 
possession and sale of syringes, 
expanded drug treatment services, 
and the establishment of legal needle 
exchange programs. They met with the 
police force, members of the criminal 
justice system, those involved in drug 
treatment, and other community-
based organizations to educate these 
groups on the potential value of 
needle exchanges and to garner their 
support. Talking with the drug users 
was also important. “We wanted to 
make sure that we were not making 
assumptions without touching base 
with the people that were going to use 
the interventions,” said O’Keefe. 


In early 1989, the Mayor’s 
Task Force presented a proposal 
for decriminalization of the sale 
and possession of syringes to the 
Connecticut State Public Health 
Committee. The hearing was a failure, 
according to O’Keefe. “Members of 
the legislature said, ‘We can’t do this; 
don’t even come back.’” 


W
hile I was on the van, a new 
client approached. Bucheli sat 
down with him at the dining room 
table to complete an initial intake form. 
As in a clinic, all client information on 
the Community Health Care Van is 
confidential. 


Bucheli gave me a copy of the 
intake form: What is your drug of 
choice? How many times a day are 
you shooting? Where did you usually 
get your syringes? Have you ever been 
to a drug treatment program, and 
would you like a referral? What is your 
HIV status? This question is multiple 
choice: Positive, Negative, Don’t 
Know, Don’t want to disclose. 


After the forms were completed, 
Bucheli 
turned 
to 
the 
kitchen 
drawers. He filled a brown lunch 
bag with supplies. “If you ever want 
to get tested, if you ever want to go 
to treatment, whatever you want, 
whenever you’re ready, let me know,” 
he said to the client. He gave him a 
pamphlet on safe injection procedures. 
With brown bag in hand, the man was 
on his way. 


Bucheli turned back to me. 
“Basically,” he said, “that’s it.” 


I
n March 1990, the Mayor’s Task 
Force on AIDS returned to the 
Public Health Committee for a 
hearing on the decriminalization of 
possession and sale of needles without 
a prescription. A year of dedicated 
lobbying had followed their initial 
rejection. Elections for the mayor of 
New Haven were held in 1989, and 
the Mayor’s Task Force campaigned 
to make sure that all candidates would 
support their policies if elected. They 
gained the official endorsement of 
public health organizations. They 
found state legislators who would 
co-sponsor a bill, William Dyson of 
New Haven and Joseph Grabarz of 
Bridgeport. 


At the hearing, the results of a 
year of advocacy were mixed. The 
committee was more receptive, but 
significant compromise was required 
for the bill to move forward. In the 
end, the state legislature approved 
one demonstration syringe exchange 
program for one year. The program 
would 
be 
exempt 
from 
legal 
restrictions on injection drug use, 
but the laws would be maintained in 
the rest of Connecticut. The state 
legislature chose New Haven as the 
demonstration site. The bill passed 
successfully through the state House 
and Senate and was signed into law in 
June 1990. 


“It was less than what we 
wanted,” said O’Keefe, “but I can 
tell you we were thrilled to have 
done that because there were very 
few places in the country that had 
even made it that far.” The successful 
passage of the Connecticut bill was 
especially remarkable because of the 
simultaneous closure of a syringe

exchange program in New York City, 
largely as a result of newly elected 
mayor David Dinkins’ opposition to 
the program.


T
oday, victories for the syringe 
exchange van are still hard-won. 
The program is still funded by the 
state, and finances are strained. 
The current van is a 1996 model. 
But to Bucheli, it’s the “new van,” 
having been purchased by the program 
last July. The previous vehicle was in 
bad shape, and had been for some 
time. A fiscal year 2010 report on 
Connecticut syringe exchanges notes 
that the New Haven program was “in 
dire need” of a new van. “We fought 
for this,” said Bucheli. 


Within thirty days of purchase, 
the new van’s generator broke. Now, 
it’s too dark to continue working after 
4:30 p.m. As a result, Bucheli and 
his colleagues have shifted the van’s 
schedule to complete the stops that 
were in the evening during the day. 
They’re missing out on an important 
time for connecting with clients. No 
one stops shooting up at four o’clock. 


“We have to fight, sometimes the 
money doesn’t come from the state 
that fast, either. We’re still waiting on 
some of the money we got awarded. 
When that comes, we can get that [the 
generator] fixed,” said Bucheli.  


Nevertheless, the new van is 
an improvement. For one thing, it’s 
larger. The old van was too small to 
draw blood for STD testing, though 
all of the van’s staff is trained to do 
so. Bucheli hopes they can start STD 
testing in the near future. 


A lot of the new van’s superiority 
has to do with what is painted on 
its side. The old van said “Harm 
Reduction.”  While harm reduction is 
not inherently linked to HIV/AIDS, 
Bucheli believes it helped the van gain 
its name on the street, the AIDS van. 
Because of the label, a lot of drug 
users were reluctant to use its services. 


On 
this 
van, 
words 
“Outreach 
Unit” 
have 
replaced 
“Harm Reduction.” Bucheli attributes 
the new name to a lot of new clients, 
almost one hundred in the last quarter 
alone. 


The paint on the van’s side has 
changed, but some drug users still 
don’t want to be associated with the 
AIDS van. Some still access the van’s 
services through friends who pick up 
needles for them, a process that is 
termed “secondary distribution.” 


“A lot of the time, clients think 
secondary distribution is a bad thing,” 
said Bucheli. “I have to reassure them 
that what you’re doing is a good thing. 
It’s a great thing.” 


hen 
demonstration 
program was approved in 1990, 
it was given a year and $25,000 to 
make its point. 


Approval 
for 
program 
stipulated that within a year, data be 
produced on its effects. Given that 
the $25,000 was barely enough for 
program costs, the New Haven Health 
Department was fortunate that Yale 
was willing to fund the evaluation pro 
bono. To do the research, Al Novick, 
chair of the Mayor’s Task Force, 
recruited Ed Kaplan, a mathematical 
modeler at the Yale School of 
Management.


The design of the evaluation was 
inherently challenging. If it were too 
intrusive, drug users would not come 
to the van. For this reason, testing 
clients for HIV was not an option. 
Extensive collection of qualitative 
data—asking the clients about their 
drug 
use 
behaviors—was 
both 
intrusive and limiting in terms of the 
conclusions that could be drawn from 
it. 


Kaplan came up with a solution. 
Rather than basing his modeling on 
client data, he would base it on syringes 
data. If he could test the returned 
needles for HIV, client involvement 
in the evaluation could be minimized. 
Robert Heimer at the Yale School of 
Medicine was enlisted for the actual 
needle analysis. To test the needles, 
Heimer used the polymerase chain 
reaction, a technique that is now an 
essential part of biomedical research, 
but at the time was still emerging. 
Each syringe would be given an 
identification number, and each client 
would choose a pseudonym to identify 
him or herself. The program’s workers 
would record who was given which 
syringe and when. They would take 
the same data for returned syringes. 
In the lab, Heimer would determine 
which returned needles were HIV 
positive. Kaplan, in his analysis, 
would compare the percentage of the 
program’s needles that were infected 
to the percentage of needles collected 
on the street and in shooting galleries 
that were infected. 


Meanwhile, the program design 
was assembled. Many of the original 
street outreach workers served as the 
van’s staff. Yale donated a van that was 
once used for dining hall deliveries. It 
was the same color as blue police vans, 
so it was re-painted a cheerful peachy 
orange, and adorned with murals by 
Bucheli filled a 
brown lunch bag 
with supplies. 
“If you ever want 
to get tested, if 
you ever want to 
go to treatment, 
whatever you 
want, whenever 
you’re ready, let 
me know,” he said 
to the client.

local high school students. 


On November 13, 1990, the 
syringe exchange van set out on its 
maiden voyage. That day, the program 
enrolled twenty clients, collecting over 
fifty needles. Three clients requested 
drug treatment. Within the program’s 
first year, over nine hundred clients 
enrolled and over one hundred were 
referred to drug treatment programs. 


Kaplan and Heimer released 
preliminary results of their research in 
July 1991. Fifty percent of the needles 
returned to the program were HIV 
positive. In comparison, 68 percent of 
street needles were positive, as were 
92 percent of needles from shooting 
galleries. 


According 
Kaplan’s 
modeling, the program decreased the 
HIV infection rate among clients by 
33 percent. 


Kaplan and Heimer’s results 
made national headlines. At the 
time, data on syringe exchanges was 
limited. The researchers’ approach 
was compelling for its objectivity 
and unobtrusiveness. “People still 
recognize how extraordinary it is, 
looking at the needles rather than the 
people,” said O’Keefe. “It was all that 
I had hoped for; it was enough to keep 
the program going.” 


The same week that Kaplan 
and Heimer released their results, 
the National Commission on AIDS 
issued a report. Entitled “The 
Twin Epidemics of Substance Use 
and HIV,” the report criticized 
the federal government for its 
insufficient response to the drug 
user-driven HIV epidemic. Among 
its recommendations, the report 
called for expanding drug treatment 
services, legalizing the possession of 
syringes, and developing programs for 
preventing HIV transmission related 
to drug use. Three years before, 
the Mayor’s Task Force had begun 
campaigning for these same changes. 
It had taken a few years of advocacy, 
but in New Haven in July 1990, 
progress appeared possible. 


B
efore Bucheli began working on 
the van, he was an advocate. In 
the late eighties and early nineties, 
Bucheli was a member of AIDS 
Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT 
UP. At the time, ACT UP participants 
were nationally famous for their 
public demonstrations to change 
AIDS-related policy. 


In 1993, Bucheli and fellow ACT 
UP members in New Haven were 
disrupting a meeting of the Mayor’s 
Task Force. They were protesting the 
fact that drug users were only able to 
receive ten syringes at a time from the 
program. As they were dragged out 
and arrested, one of ACT UP’s police 
liaisons noticed the health department 
was looking for an outreach worker for 
the program. “He said, ‘This would be 
a great job for you,’ ” Bucheli recalled. 
Three months later, Bucheli was hired. 


When Clinton was elected, the 
New Haven chapter of ACT UP 
disbanded. They thought the fight 
had been won. For syringe exchanges, 
the early 1990’s did produce some 
successes. In Connecticut, the state 
legislature established five additional 
syringe 
exchange 
programs 
and 
legalized the sale and possession of 
syringes without a prescription. The 
early success of the New Haven 
syringe exchange program influenced 
development 
of 
nationally, including in Massachusetts 
and California. In New York, the New 
Haven results were instrumental in 
Mayor Dinkins’ decision to revive a 
syringe exchange program two years 
after shutting it down.


Clinton, however, disappointed 
advocates
