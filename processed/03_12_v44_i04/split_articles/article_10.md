X-Cubed
For Kanani Lee, a geophysicist 
working 
at 
Yale, 
key 
to 
reconstructing the earth’s history 
is 
high 
pressure. 
Her 
lab 
known as the X-cubed lab, which 
stands for “Exploring Extremes 
Experimentally.” The lab studies a 
little-known layer near the planet’s 
core, about 1,800 miles beneath the 
surface and 257 times deeper than the 
deepest place on the ocean floor. At 
that depth, the temperature is about 
forty times hotter than a Finnish 
sauna. The pressure there is about 
twenty times that required to make 
coal into a diamond.
If you were to dig a tunnel to 
the center of the Earth, you’d first 
go through a layer of rocks and dirt 
five times as deep as Mount Everest is 
high. Eventually you’d hit the mantle, 
a wide layer of magma about as solid 
as warm wax, the molten rock rising 
and falling slowly as it gains and 
loses heat. Some radioactive elements 
would probably ooze by you. Then, 
before reaching the layer of liquid iron 
that surrounds the Earth’s solid core, 
you’d pass through something else. 
“We think we know what’s 
down there, but it’s with your eyes 
closed and a blindfold on,” Lee said. 
Geologists just can’t figure out what 
goes on between the rocky mantle and 
the nickel-and-iron core—whether 
that layer of Earth is liquid or solid, 
whether it’s cooling down or heating 
up, and what exactly it’s made of. 
“There’s a big debate right now 
about how hot it is down there, with 
a discrepancy of about 2,000 degrees 
Kelvin. That’s a drastic uncertainty,” 
said Jung-Fu Lin, a mineral physicist 
at the University of Texas at Austin.
The layer between the mantle and 
core might be the source of heat that 
drives magma to the surface, causing 
volcanic eruptions. Ultimately, if 
researchers can understand this layer,
