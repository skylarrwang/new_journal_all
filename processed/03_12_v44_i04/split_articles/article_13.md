**Pressed Specimens**

While Horatio Fenn was studying 
at the Yale College Medical Institute 
in 1822, he created a book containing 
over seven hundred pressed plant 
specimens he found in and around 
New Haven. Fenn’s book is now in the 
Yale Herbarium at 21 Sachem Street, 
where the university’s plant specimens 
are kept. The pages are yellowing, 
but the specimens themselves look 
surprisingly well preserved. 

Patrick 
Sweeney, 
collections 
manager at the Yale Herbarium, is 
plucking pages from the spine of 
Fenn’s book and carefully turning 
them to prevent the pressed plants 
from cracking. He explains that 
the book contains only some of 
the 350,000 plant specimens in the 
herbarium. Sweeney replaces Fenn’s 
book in a covered box, which he 
then places in a metal cupboard on 
the side of the room. There are rows 
and rows of these metal cupboards—
the Yale Herbarium looks more like 
a bank vault than a museum. There 
is a surgical feel to the room—its 
humidity and temperature levels are 
closely regulated and recorded.

In the years since Fenn assembled 
his book, botanists have improved the 
ways they prepare plant pressings. 
They freeze specimens at -20 degrees 
Celsius for a week before storage to 
kill insects and use archival-quality 
papers and glues that won’t easily 
deteriorate or give off harmful gases.

The 
next 
advancement 
is 
digitization. Botanists are currently 
engaged in the colossal task of 
preserving 
fragile, 
sometimes 
centuries-old leaves like Fenn’s in 
online databases where scientists 
worldwide can access and analyze 
them. They take photographs of a 
specimen and store them with its 
taxonomic information and other 
data such as the time and location it 
was collected. Digitization saves time 
for plant scientists and helps them 
efficiently analyze differences over 
time in traits such as leaf size, the 
presence of glands on leaves, and 
flowering time.

“With a high resolution image of 
a specimen, I don’t have to go to the 
herbarium,” said Michael Donoghue, 
the herbarium’s curator.

Although 
herbariums 
have 
existed 
since 
mid-sixteenth 
century, experts estimate that at least 
seventy thousand plant species have 
yet to be named. Digital herbariums 
will allow researchers to identify 
these new species more efficiently, 
study plant evolution, and strengthen 
relationships among botanists in 
different countries.

The Yale Herbarium recently 
finished 
digitizing 
Peabody 
Museum’s collection of Connecticut 
plant specimens. From 2008 to 2011, 
nearly fifty thousand were catalogued. 
Some of the specimens are more than 
two hundred years old.

Outside the herbarium is the 
Herb Scan, which resembles a washing 
machine with an inverted scanner on 
top of it. This machine takes high-
resolution pictures of pressed plant 
specimens with speed and uniformity. 
A grant from the Andrew Mellon 
Foundation’s Global Plants Initiative, 
the world’s largest coordinated effort 
to digitize plant type specimens and 
scholarly resources from herbaria, 
paid for it.

Melissa 
Tulig, 
an 
associate 
director at the New York Botanical 
Garden, called the Global Plants 
Initiative a success because of the 
valuable funding it provided. “We 
needed that start-up,” she said.

A similar project, the National 
Science 
Foundation’s 
Advancing 
Digitization of Biological Collection, 
began in 2011 and aims to create 
digital records of the nearly one 
billion plant specimens in American 
museums within ten years. Together 
these projects preserve our world’s 
wealth of natural resources and create 
a global network of information for 
plant scientists.
