more thoroughly describe the patterns 
of symptoms and behavior that 
doctors are observing in children and 
adults with autism. 

Lord also questions the ethics 
of Volkmar’s decision to release 
information from an embargoed 
article, calling the amount of publicity 
it has received “appalling.” When 
scientific articles are under embargo 
by a journal, the authors 
are expected not to discuss 
the study until it has been 
reviewed and printed.

According 
to 
McPartland, he did not find 
out that their article had been 
accepted by the journal until 
the day Volkmar gave his talk 
in Iceland, so the embargo may 
not have gone into effect until 
after Volkmar’s presentation. 
In any case, the embargo rule 
most scientific journals follow 
allows authors to discuss 
abstracts of upcoming papers 
at scientific conferences, as 
Volkmar did. While authors 
are not supposed to court 
media attention, they are not 
penalized for ensuing news 
coverage; coverage which, in 
this case, has put the DSM-
5 committee in an awkward 
position. The members of the 
committee feel the need to defend the 
criteria they are developing. Because 
the DSM-5 committee cannot yet read 
the Yale researchers’ paper, however, 
they cannot assess the validity of the 
results. “It is impossible to talk about 
it until we’ve seen it, which we’ve not,” 
Lord said when asked about Volkmar’s 
and McPartland’s research. 

Lined up on a shelf, the previous 
editions 
of 
the 
DSM, 
“Shrink’s Bible,” form a rainbow—
each paperback spine adds a new 
color, a new chapter in psychiatric 
history and a shift in the perception 
and diagnosis of autism. Although the 
disorder was first described in 1943 
by a psychiatrist named Leo Kanner, 
the first two editions of the DSM 
did not classify it as a distinct illness. 
Instead, autism was mistakenly said to 
be a rare subset of schizophrenia that 
came on in early childhood in reaction 
to a cold, disconnected “refrigerator” 
mother. In those days, a child’s 
diagnosis was a shameful secret to be 
kept from family and friends. It was 
considered common knowledge that 
such children could not be taught, and 
they were shipped off to institutions, 
usually for life.

Then, in 1980, the APA released 
the lime-green DSM-III. Inside was a 
new section called “Infantile Autism.” 
For the first time, autism had its own 
definition and a clear statement of its 
characteristic symptoms. Researchers 
began to notice that autism ran 
in 
families, 
across 
generations, 
suggesting that genes might play a 
role in determining who developed it. 
They also realized that a larger-than-
normal percentage of autistic children 
suffered from seizures, indicating that 
the disease was rooted in the biology 
of the brain, not in bad parenting. 
Autism as defined by the DSM-
III was severely debilitating. Most 
individuals who received the diagnosis 
had IQs below 70, in the intellectually 
disabled range. Few learned to talk or 
live independently. The individuals 
who qualified as autistic under this 
definition made little eye 
contact and often spent hours 
alone, rocking back and forth 
in corners, hands flapping 
rhythmically by their sides. By 
the early 1990s, it had become 
clear 
that 
psychologists 
diagnosing autism in children 
were leaving out a large 
group of kids like Jack who 
have normal and even high 
IQs, who are often talkative 
and talented, but who lag 
behind their peers socially. 
These children seem to lack 
an understanding of social 
rules, fail to form friendships, 
and often cannot carry on 
conversations. 
When 
they 
do join conversations, they 
often talk incessantly about 
one apparently random topic, 
such as vacuum cleaners 
or aqueducts. While these 
people are better equipped to 
function in day-to-day life than their 
more severely affected peers, they 
often have great difficulty in school, 
face horrific bullying, and lack the 
social tact to hold down jobs. 
Finding ways to help those 
people motivated Volkmar and his 
colleagues as they revised the DSM-
III definition. In addition to covering 
children, the DSM-IV also changed 
the lives of many adults who had 
never been diagnosed as they’d grown 
up with the narrower criteria of the 
previous DSM.
“Everything in life has been 
a struggle for me,” said John, who 
learned only four years ago, at 44, that 
To advocates for autistic 
children and their 
families, the proposals 
threaten to deprive 
hundreds of thousands 
of children and adults of 
badly needed services 
and a label that has 
become central to their 
identities.

he has an Autism Spectrum Disorder. 
John has a steady job as a lineman for 
Connecticut Light and Power, a wife, 
and a home, but getting there has 
been tough. He was held back in the 
first and tenth grades and eventually 
dropped out of high school. He finally 
earned his high school diploma at the 
age of 23. John’s peers teased him 
and called him names at school and 
his alcoholic father did the same at 
home. Age has done little to reduce 
the number of taunts thrown at him. 
“One guy said to another guy in 
a conversation in a room, he said ‘Uh, 
I think John is functionally retarded,’ 
” said John, recalling a recent incident 
with his co-workers. “The other guy 
said, ‘Well, what do you mean, you 
think he’s an idiot savant?’ And the 
other guy says, ‘No, he can’t be an 
idiot savant, he’s not good at anything, 
he’s just an idiot.’ ”

Under the DSM-III, John, who 
asked that his last name not be used 
for fear of repercussions at work, 
was too smart, too verbal, and too 
functional to be considered autistic. 
As a consequence, John never received 
help in school. No one ever took the 
time to try to teach him the social 
skills he lacked. The DSM-III left him, 
and many others, out in the cold. 
“If you’re not sure what you 
have, how do you know to handle 
life?” John asked.

The DSM-IV, with its broadened 
definition of autism, gave John and 
others like him a name for their 
problems. That broader definition 
came too late to help John in school 
but has changed his life since then, he 
said.
“If I run into a situation either 
at work or at home and it’s a rough 
course I’m going through,” said 
John, “I can analyze it and think to 
myself, ‘Well, wait a minute, that’s the 
Asperger’s.’ ”

But the breadth that allowed the 
DSM-IV diagnoses to help people 
such as Jack and John has led to a large 
increase in the number of diagnoses. 
Since the publication of the DSM-IV 
in 1994, autism and related disorders 
have gone from being relatively rare, 
around one in five thousand children 
at the time of DSM-IV’s release, to 
alarmingly common. The most recent 
studies put the prevalence at around 1 
in 110 children.

Volkmar 
believes 
increase in the rate of autism diagnosis 
means doctors are getting better at 
identifying the kids who need help. 
But other psychiatrists disagree. Some 
believe that the DSM-IV’s expanded 
definition went too far.

Allen 
Frances, 
former 
chairman of the DSM-IV Task Force, 
the umbrella group responsible for the 
DSM revision process, has repeatedly 
denounced the DSM-IV for setting 
off a “false epidemic.” He argues the 
rate of diagnosis needs to be curtailed. 
At stake in the debate is money. 
Before the DSM-IV, less than 1 percent 
of students receiving special education 
services were autistic. Now more than 
4 percent are, and the amount districts 
spend on special education services 
has skyrocketed. The annual cost of 
caring for individuals with autism in 
the United States is now $35 billion. 
In 2007, the APA set about 
revising the criteria again. The 
association appointed Dr. Susan 
Swedo, a senior investigator at the 
National Institute of Mental Health, 
as the chair of the committee that 
would deal with the autism criteria. A 
year later, Volkmar and thirteen other 
prominent psychiatrists and experts 
were asked to join the committee 
under Swedo’s leadership. Soon after,

the committee held a small conference 
for its members at the University of 
California, Davis.

During the conference, three 
groups each made recommendations 
for changing the DSM. One suggested 
only mild reforms, examining the role 
of IQ in diagnosis, for example, but 
made no mention of changing the 
overall DSM-IV structure. The other 
two groups, however, came back with 
much more drastic recommendations. 
Both advocated eliminating Asperger’s 
Syndrome altogether and suggested 
starting throwing away the existing 
framework entirely. By the spring of 
2009, just a year after the conference, 
Volkmar and another member of the 
committee had resigned. 

Volkmar refuses to discuss his 
resignation, saying only that he had 
become 
“disenchanted 
with 
process.” When asked about the 
committee, he said, “I’m not saying 
anything bad about anyone. They’re 
wonderful people, God love ’em. Just, 
what a mess.”

Since 
conference 
and 
Volkmar’s resignation, the DSM-
5 
committee 
has 
followed 
recommendations of the groups 
advocating radical change. In several 
statements issued to the public, 
the committee has stated that the 
distinctions in the DSM-IV among 
Asperger’s, PDD-NOS, and autism 
are arbitrary and confusing, like 
“trying to cleave meatloaf at the 
joints.” They intend to replace the 
DSM-IV’s Pervasive Developmental 
Disorders category with a single 
disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder. 
Currently, a patient can receive 
a diagnosis on the autism spectrum 
if he or she demonstrates only some 
characteristic autism behaviors. The 
system is complicated, and there 
are a total of 2688 combinations of 
symptoms that would qualify for a 
diagnosis. The new rules are simpler—
there are only six combinations of 
symptoms that qualify. 

While simpler, the new rules may 
make the standards for determining 
who receives a diagnosis on the autism 
spectrum more stringent. A patient 
will only receive a diagnosis if he 
demonstrates each and every one of 
a series of social and communicative 
impairments. He will also have to 
have at least two types of restricted 
or repetitive behaviors—rocking back 
and forth and obsessively lining toys 
up in a line, for example. 

The committee that has drafted 
the new definitions maintains that no 
one who currently has a diagnosis will 
be cut off. The spectrum of disorders 
will be just as broad under the new 
rules as under the current ones, they 
say. “Really, things looked pretty 
good,” Lord said, based on the data 
she has seen. She admits that the field 
trials examining how the new criteria 
will affect autism diagnosis rates have 
been small, and that other, larger 
studies of the new criteria have not 
addressed the question of whether

one of the children 
who would be 
affected by changes 
to the definition of 
autism.
