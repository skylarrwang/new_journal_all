EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Just two weeks before Thanksgiving, 
the scent of braising meat, like 
bread and old leaves, filled the kitchen. 
My squirrel was breaking down, 
slipping off its bones. One of my 
housemates walked in, where I leaned 
over the stovetop watching our dinner 
simmer. 

“Smells great,” Travis said. I 
nodded and sniffed again. Squirrel, I 
thought, smells like both rabbit and 
quail, but also nutty and a little gamey. 
Rodent might not be prime protein, 
but a hunter obeys her principles. If 
you kill it, you eat it.

The inversion of that principle 
brought me to hunting. If you eat it, 
you kill it—or at least comprehend 
what it means to kill for food. The 
combination of that conviction with 
a commitment to local, organic food 
forms the foundation of an ethos of 
eating that is increasing in popularity. 
The locavore, or local eater, reduces 
carbon footprint, removes her support 
from landscape-destroying factory 
farms, and instead contributes to her 
regional economy (generally within 
one hundred miles). More and more 
local eaters—mostly young, white, and 
educated—are making the lunge from 
the neighborhood farmer’s market to 
the forest kill. This fall, I joined them.

I have been trying to eat local 
as much as possible for almost five 
years. I’ve also worked, both for pay 


years. I’ve also worked, both for pay and not, for brief stints on organic 
farms. Eating local, organic food ties 
the diner to the land, celebrating the 
methods of agriculture just as much as 
the products. Locavorism is beautiful. 
Like most urban locavores, what 
I’ve done to support local, organic 
agriculture has mostly been limited to 
conscientious consumption. However, 
for those who eat meat, the inevitable 
conclusion of the locavore philosophy 
is killing, not purchasing, your dinner. 
Eating wild game uses fewer natural 
resources and causes less ecological 
damage than eating domesticated 
animals. Six years ago,  Michael Pollan 
suggested in his seminal book, The 
Omnivore’s Dilemma, that if most of 
the food Americans consume travels 
across half a continent to the dinner 
plate, then hunting in your backyard is 
the omnivore’s solution.

Some 
urban 
foragers 
have 
quietly taken to parks to seek rabbits 
and pigeons for their stockpots. 
Others swipe fresh roadkill. They’re 
beginning to gain public recognition. 
Last summer Hank Shaw published 
his cookbook Hunt, Gather, Cook: 
Finding the Forgotten Feast. Sam Sifton, 
restaurant critic for The New York 
Times, gave the book a strong, 
positive review. A month earlier, 
Mark Zuckerberg publicly declared 
his abstinence from any meat that he 
has not shot himself. Jackson Landers, 
who offers a home-butchery and 
deer biology course called “Hunting 
for Locavores” in his hometown of 
Charlottesville, Virginia, published a 
book called The Beginner’s Guide to Deer 
Hunting for Food in September.

What the book doesn’t mention 
is that hunting brings the locavore into 
contact with more than an animal. 
Hunting placed me at a meeting-point 
between hunters living their family 
tradition and young urbanites who’ve 
never tasted wild game.

I decided to try hunting myself, 
first for small game and then for 
deer. I hoped to end the season with 
a freezer chest of butchered venison. 
If you, reader, are like me, then you 
will want to know how the uninitiated 
can become blaze-orange-wearing 
huntsmen. 

First, you’ve got to get legal.


LICENSED TO KILL
The Ulster Heights Rod and 
Gun Club sits at the feet of the 
Catskills, some ninety miles upriver 
from Manhattan, twenty miles west 
of the Hudson River. Cell phones 
don’t work there and, on a Saturday 
morning in October, fog lay over the 
few fields visible from the road like a 
second crop. I am nearly one hundred 
miles west of New Haven, but only a 
few dozen from my mother’s family 
home.

It was terribly cold inside the 
cement brick building, but it was 
crowded. Most of the forty odd 
hunter’s safety education certification 
candidates were white males, ranging 
in age from the twelve-year-old three 
rows back to the whiskered grey-hairs 
who know their guns. Nearly all of us 
wore variations on old jeans and work 
flannel. It was a worn-looking crowd. 
Most of these men were preparing 
to enter a hunting community 
sustained by tradition. Families pass 
on that tradition, fathers, like the man 
who embraced his son,  a soft-cheeked 
teenager, when the boy walked out 
with his safety certificate. These 
families have been eating sustainably 
for generations. The wood-colored 
fellow next to me, who called me 
“honey” when I passed him a rifle, 
told me he liked bear meat best of all 
game.

New York, like most states, 
requires attending a hunter safety 
course like the one hosted by the 
Rod and Gun Club. The International 
Hunter 
Education 
Association 
provides 
the 
curriculum, 
which 
covers different types of firearms, 
ammunition, the mechanical sequence 
of a bullet leaving a gun, and basic 
safety rules and tips. Our two 
instructors speak most adamantly, 
and eloquently, about the ethics and 
tradition of hunting. 

“You do not drive through town 
with a buck on the hood of your car. 
Those days are over,” Carl, a former 
police officer, told us. He doesn’t want 
hunters vilified. The combination of 
a cute, dead animal and triumphant 
gunman paints a tired picture of 
redneck bloodlust. It is the clichéd 
image of a community whose sport 
has become increasingly regulated 
and politicized over the last three 
decades—a sport on the defense. 
Carl told us that hunters have a 
duty to conservation, to protecting 
land and resources for sustained use. 
A hunter kills only as many creatures 
as a healthy ecosystem can afford. 
“Conservation 
is 
not 
environmentalism,” he announced, 
his enunciation forceful from years 
in law enforcement. Carl was assuring 
my fellow students that he did not 
want to force a partisan agenda 
on them. I imagine that, to Carl, 
“environmentalism” means something 
too extreme, irrelevant, and yuppie—a 
little like me, staring at him from the 
aisle two rows back.

Killing this 
creature only felt 
tragic because 
I had witnessed 
its death. I don’t 
see the meat that 
lives as poorly as 
it dies.


But 
from 
where 
I 
sit, 
conservation is environmentalism. In 
an America where food is produced 
on fear-inducing scales and where 
we throw away our meals as easily as 
we consume them, the idea of being 
conservative in what you kill and eat is 
countercultural.

I wondered what else I might 
agree on with these men. I saw in the 
instructors and my fellow students 
signs of an unspoken, deep respect 
for the natural landscape. A new 
hunter needs the knowledge that these 
men possess. After a license, you need 
a guide. 


AMONG THE TREES
It took me half an hour to bag my 
first squirrel. She went down with 
a shoulder shot, which shattered her 
right leg and struck through her left 
ribs, exactly what Joe had told me you 
want with small game. It was the first 
weekend in November and the first 
time I had ever looked through the 
scope of a rifle to see an eye gazing 
back.

Joe LaGatutta, my new mentor, 
had driven over for my gun shakedown 
that afternoon. We were shooting on 
my mother’s late aunt’s property on 
the Hudson River. Eight years ago, 
when Joe had started helping my 
mother tear asbestos insulation out of 
one of the buildings, he had already 
been working for many of the families 
in the small village of West Park 
(seven miles north of Poughkeepsie 
on the western bank of the Hudson) 
as a contractor. Joe had agreed to 
take on my mother on the condition 
that she let him track game across the 
property. With his extensive client list, 
Joe has accumulated a massive system 
of private hunting grounds this way. 
He shares the tree stands he has set 
up all throughout the creased woods 
of the Catskill foothills with a group 
of hunting buddies, and he teaches 
many of the neighborhood kids how 
to hunt, including me. 

Joe grew up in the Bronx, 
spending his summers in the village 
five miles south of West Park. As a 
young teenager he would walk into the 
woods at the town’s end and, when he 
re-emerged, it was with pockets heavy 
with squirrel, he told me. He wanted 
me to start the same way.

With little preface, Joe had 
slapped a cardboard box with target 
stickers in front of a brush pile and 
watched me load his Remington .22 
caliber with four bullets. I had settled 
myself around the gun, nuzzling its 
stock into my shoulder and curving 
down so that my cheek bulged on top 
of its butt, pulling the gun hard against 
my collarbone, pressing my hand into 
the side of a tree for stability. This 
settling isn’t a quick motion, not for a 
beginner, because the coordination of 
muscles is unique to shooting.

More important, however, is 
breathing. All gunmen know and 
preach the same breathing sequence: 
you breathe naturally until you’ve 
got your sights aligned, take a 
breath, release it halfway, and gently 
squeeze the trigger. I first learned 
this technique at summer camp, 
where I loved the rifle range and shot 
nearly every day, though, when I had 
considered it then, I was repelled by 
the thought of killing animals. Joe had 
me practice standing shots and then 
sitting ones, my back against the tree, 
arms braced against my knees, taking 
advantage of the natural environment. 
I shot well and he was pleased. Of 
the few that weren’t bulls’ eyes, Joe 
said, “That’s still a dead squirrel.” I 
was ready enough. Any beginner with 
steady hands and a week at a practice 
range could be as good.

Joe taught me only a little less 
carefully than he had helped sight 
his elderly brother-in-law who, due 
to damage from cataract surgery, has 
had to learn to shoot lefty. Another 
day I watched, disconcerted, as the 
older man’s bullets went wide of the 
deer-sized target’s entire body. But Joe 
watched him keenly, offering pointers 
to bring his shot into the killing circle.

Joe left me the rifle and a box of 
bullets. I walked down the wooded 
river bluff with an intent to kill. 

I settled myself in the tree stand 
that Joe had installed above a deer 
bedding area in a low spot that runs 
parallel to the river. From fifteen 
feet up I could see the Hudson, the 
neighboring monastery, and an entire 
swath of forest that I had never seen 
before. From this vantage I could read 
the terrain. I saw the worn tracks of 
animals in parted grasses and deadfall.

I sat there twitching. Hunting 
really shouldn’t be an active verb, I 
thought. From all that I had heard 
from Joe and the guys at the Rod and 
Gun club, the activity largely consists 
of hours spent waiting and watching. 
Hunters will come away from the deer 
season often with only one to four 
kills, but many cold days of stillness. 
I didn’t shoot the first squirrel I 
could. You don’t shoot the first one, 
Joe had explained to me, because 
more will follow, and you don’t want 
to scare them off. When you do shoot 
one, you do not retrieve it immediately. 
“Fifteen minutes later they’ll come 
back to play,” he told me.

The 
second 
squirrel 
came 
skittering into the western edge of 
the deer’s clearing, spiraling around a 
log as it chased a third. My sensations 
heightened by adrenaline, I nearly 
laughed at their play. The squirrel 
stopped on the log, though her friend 
continued on into a thicket. She sat up 
on her hind legs in perfect profile and 
looked at me, coquettish and bold, and 
as accommodating as Joe had said she 
would be. I lined up my muzzle, my 
shoulders, my cheek, and breathed in, 
half out, and gently pulled the trigger. 
She flew off the log, bounced three, 
maybe four, squirrel jumps and then 
dribbled under another downed tree 
about six feet from the first, where she 
immediately ceased moving.
