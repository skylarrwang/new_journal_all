the criteria would cut people off the 
spectrum. 

Volkmar calls the committee’s 
assurances 
“misleading.” 
The 
committee’s 
public 
statements 
have implied “we’re gonna have 
one big happy family of Autism 
Spectrum Disorder,” he said. What 
the committee is not advertising, he 
said, is that the newly defined Autism 
Spectrum Disorder will narrow the 
spectrum back down to a disorder 
more akin to autism under the DSM-
III.

“It’s actually going to be classical 
autism,” Volkmar says, smacking his 
palm with the back of his other hand. 
He is frustrated that the new criteria 
may narrow the autism spectrum back 
to intellectually disabled individuals, 
excluding those with higher IQs but 
significant social impairments.

Shortly after Volkmar left the 
DSM-5 committee, he and McPartland 
decided to go back over diagnostic 
assessments carried out while testing 
the DSM-IV criteria and examine 
how the children who participated 
in the study would have been scored 
had they been using the proposed 
DSM-5 criteria. As they disclosed at 
the conference in Iceland, 56 percent 
of patients with normal or high IQs 
(above 70) who received a DSM-IV 
diagnosis of autism, Asperger’s, or 
PDD-NOS would not have qualified 
for a diagnosis of autism spectrum 
disorder according to the new 
standards.

Similarly, this June, a group of 
researchers from Finland announced 
that only 46 percent of a group of 
children who were diagnosed with 
an autism spectrum disorder under 
the DSM-IV met the new criteria for 
autism. In another study, researchers 
in 
London 
examined 
diagnostic 
records of children with PDD-NOS. 
Almost none of the children displayed 
enough rigid, stereotyped behaviors to 
meet the proposed criteria for Autism 
Spectrum Disorder.

Lord argues that these studies 
all have a “major inherent flaw.” 
Some of the symptoms the DSM-5 
asks clinicians to check for, she says, 
were not included in the DSM-IV at 
all. If clinicians never asked about 
these symptoms when the diagnoses 
were first made, there is no way to 
know whether a child evaluated 
under the DSM-IV had them or 
not. For this reason, she says it 
is impossible to determine from 
previously collected data how 
the new criteria will affect autism 
rates. Still, she said, “We really 
want to know who didn’t meet 
and why.” She said the committee 
is open to making changes if its 
members can be convinced that 
many patients will be cut off 
the spectrum. But, “For that, we 
need information,” she said. “We 
don’t need polemics.”

Lord said that the DSM-5 
is strictly a scientific description 
of symptoms and behavior and 
that her colleagues can’t be expected 
to decide social policy for the country. 
DSM does not directly determine who 
gets access to services. “If you need 
treatment, you should get it, with or 
without a label,” she said.

But Jennifer Laviano, a special 
education 
lawyer 
Sherman, 
Connecticut, noted that bureaucracies 
such as school districts that regularly 
care for autistic people depend on 
authoritative diagnoses. “While there 
should be no difference in the services 
a child receives based on the label the 
child is given, the reality is that there 
are many important reasons that 
label matters.” An autism diagnosis 
can give parents more bargaining 
power in their meetings with school 
board officials and can help educators 
understand the obstacles a child faces.

School districts spend three to six 
times more on educating a child with 
autism than they would on educating 
a child who receives no special 
services. “School districts generally 
will use almost any excuse they can 
not to identify a child, especially if 
it’s going to be a costly program,” 
Laviano said. She also said that it 
is especially difficult to convince 
school districts to provide services for 
children who have high IQs but who 
are socially impaired. “School districts 
will say, ‘Oh, well, academically, he’s 
on grade level,’ or ‘If you look at 
his Connecticut Mastery Test scores, 
he’s always meeting goal,’ ” she said. 
Although the laws governing special 
cover 
functional 
and 
adaptive skills—such as classroom 
behavior, cooperation, and learning 
to take care of oneself—as well as 
academics, schools do not usually 
prioritize helping socially impaired 
children.

Andreana 
Bellach, 
a 
Stamford, 
Connecticut 
who 
represents 
school 
districts, argues that, often, more 
intelligent children don’t need special 
education services, even if they are 
awkward and uncomfortable in social 
situations. Such children benefit from 
“high cognitive functioning as well as 
their ability to be resilient and apply 
what they’ve learned,” Bellach said.

Often, parents find that the fight 
for support in school, for classroom 
aides, therapies, and special social-
skills training, goes hand-in-hand 
with the battle for a diagnosis. The 
biggest weapon parents have is a 
federal law, the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Act, which 
guarantees a “free and appropriate 
public education” to all children with 
disabilities. In order to be eligible for 
the school services mandated by 
the law, however, a child must fall 
into one of thirteen categories. 
Autism is one of them.

Decisions 
about 
special 
education services are made by a 
tribunal of school administrators, 
teachers, 
providers, the child’s parents, and 
often lawyers. The group is called 
a Planning and Placement Team, 
and it determines what kinds 
of services are included in each 
child’s Individualized Education 
Program. Often, the members 
of the group disagree on what 
services a child should receive. 
Parents want their children to 
get as much help as possible, and 
schools need to conserve resources. 
Parents come to the meetings armed 
with every shred of information that 
could help prove that their child has 
significant challenges. Having an 
official diagnosis makes a difference.

“The reason that we have 
diagnoses is to help people who need 
help to get help,” said McPartland, 
the Yale researcher who presented 
alongside 
Volkmar 
Iceland. 
Lord argued that the committee’s 
responsibility is to science, not to 
society, but McPartland wishes that 
she and the other committee members 
would think more carefully about the 
effects their work will have. “We’re at 
the intersection of clinical decision 
making and public policy, and I don’t 
know how it’s going to be decided,” 
he said.

T
he qualities that Bellach described 
are visible in Winegardner’s son 
Jack, who, despite his social difficulties, 
Since 1994, the 
prevalence of autism 
and related disorders 
has gone from around 1 
in 5,000 children, to 
around 1 in 110 children.


has a high IQ and performs above 
grade-level on his standardized tests.

“We struggled a long time 
and fought for a long time to get 
an autism diagnosis,” Winegardner 
said. Jack, who at six had so much 
trouble passing out valentines to his 
classmates, is now eight years old. He 
was diagnosed with PDD-NOS when 
he was five, but even under the current 
DSM-IV criteria, getting the label and 
more importantly, school services, was 
a struggle.

“We were told by a lot of people, 
‘Oh he doesn’t present as a kid with 
autism,’” said Winegardner. Still, 
by the time Jack was two and in a 
preschool class, she knew something 
was wrong. “I started to notice that he 
wasn’t interacting with his peers and 
he wasn’t talking to the teacher,” she 
says. In fact, Jack wasn’t talking at all. 
Jack’s teacher voiced concerns and 
encouraged Winegardner to seek help. 
But when Jean took her son to be 
evaluated by the Maryland Infants and 
Toddlers Program, the state’s agency 
for very young children with special 
needs, he did not qualify. 

“They were like, ‘Oh he’s a boy, 
he’s a second child, he probably 
doesn’t have to talk as much,’ ” 
Winegardner recalled. Her older son 
had been a late talker as well, and 
the evaluators suggested she was 
probably overreacting. When Jack 
turned three and was still struggling 
in the classroom, Winegardner again 
sought to qualify her son for special 
services, this time at Montgomery 
County’s 
department, Childfind. Again, she was 
disappointed. 

“He works really well one-on-one 
with adults, and that was what the test 
was, so he performed really well,” said 
Jean. “It wasn’t really indicative of 
how he was functioning in the larger 
world.” When a psychologist finally 
visited the school, she agreed with 
Jean that something was wrong. Jack 
did not interact with his classmates 
but spent most of his time playing 
by himself. He was obsessed with 
trains. He could speak, but did so 
rarely. Following the psychologist’s 
recommendation, the school system 
moved Jack to a special-education 
preschool. 

Without an autism diagnosis, 
however, Jack would only be eligible for 
services until the end of kindergarten. 
With a diagnosis, he could receive help 
until his 21st birthday or high school 
graduation. 

Just after Jack turned five, he 
got a diagnosis. Jean enrolled him in 
a study at the National Institute of 
Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, 
and during the screening process 
for the study, doctors gave Jack the 
PDD-NOS label. Armed with the 
diagnosis, Jean was able to get her 
son an Individualized Education Plan, 
which provided a classroom aide and 
accommodation 
on 
assignments. 
Perhaps 
most 
importantly, 
the 
diagnosis helped Jack’s peers and 
teachers understand him.

“An 
autism 
diagnosis 
identifying my son as PDD-NOS has 
given us a starting place and a map and 
a path,” said Winegardner. Although 
coming to terms with Jack’s disability 
has been difficult, the diagnosis has 
given her a way to get Jack help. But 
Winegardner worries a lot about what 
will happen when the DSM-5 comes 
out and what will happen if the criteria 
become narrower.

“No one would look at Jack now 
and say he’s not autistic,” Winegardner 
said. “But then again,” she hesitated, 
“there will always be somebody who 
falls just outside.” She just hopes it 
won’t be her son.
