then they might be able to reconstruct 
how deep and hot the ocean of molten 
rock that covered the earth’s surface 
during its infancy was once. “We want 
to know what the earth was like as a 
baby,” said Zhixue Du, a graduate 
student in Lee’s lab. 

Lately, Lee and Du have been 
squeezing and heating various metals 
and compounds that geophysicists 
know 
exist 
at 
the 
core-mantle 
boundary. “The melting point is above 
3,000 degrees Kelvin, so just getting 
these temperatures is hard,” said Lee. 
That’s more than hot enough to melt 
thermometers. As Du says, “You cook 
it.”

Right now, Du is researching 
magnesium oxide, one of the most 
abundant materials in the Earth’s 
mantle, and likely one of the 
compounds that was floating around 
in the scalding primordial mess 
billions of years ago. He wants to 
know just how hot and pressurized 
the material can get before it melts. 
“You can simulate when the earth was 
molten and see how the atoms are 
moving. That’s what we’re hoping to 
get,” said Du. 

Du takes microscopic specks 
of the compound, which look like 
particles of yellow Jell-O! under 
the microscope, and wedges them 
between two diamonds set in steel 
cylinders. Then he tightens the bolts 
on the cylinders until the slab of oxide 
is under extremely high pressure—
about 1.4 million times the ambient 
pressure in which we live and breathe. 
He fires lasers at the oxide to heat 
it. The experiment only lasts about a 
tenth of a second.

The planet’s interior is currently 
the subject of heated scientific debate 
all over the world. One group has set 
up seismometers at the South Pole 
to measure earthquake vibrations 
that might reveal clues about the 
Earth’s inner structure. Many, like 
those in Lee’s group, are trying to 
find out how certain materials behave 
at extraordinary temperatures and 
pressures. Some of the other methods 
used to create these conditions 
involve contraptions the size of a car 
and ten-meter long guns that create 
high-pressure shock waves with a tiny 
particle bullet.

“If you want to understand 
conditions billions of years ago, you 
can actually go to the lab and simulate 
them,” said Du. “We’re getting toward 
understanding the evolution of the 
world.”
