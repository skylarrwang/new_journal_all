For 
Robert 
Mendelsohn, 
a climate change economist at 
the Yale School of Forestry and 
Environmental Studies, efficiency is 
key. I asked him about the School of 
Forestry’s community tree-planting 
initiatives, and while he acknowledged 
the value of green space in a city, 
he couldn’t help pointing out the 
project’s potential negative outcomes. 
He noted that leaves from the trees 
would fall on the streets, requiring 
more clean-up by the city and more 
taxpayer dollars.

Environmentalists consider 
Mendelsohn a menace. Mendelsohn 
considers himself a moderate who 
makes well-measured judgments. 
“You need to look at all sides of 
the equation,” he said. 

Mendelsohn is among the most 
respected researchers in his field, but 
his views on the economics of climate 
change are controversial. Though 
many climatologists predict that global 
temperature will increase by an average 
of two to four degrees Fahrenheit in 
the next several decades with serious 
consequences, 
Mendelsohn 
isn’t 
worried. He believes that people will 
be able to adapt their ways of life to 
warmer temperatures. The immediate 
economic drawbacks would outweigh 
the benefits of a large-scale effort 
to reduce climate change, he argues. 
Climate scientists have recently grown 
alarmist in their public statements, 
he said. “The actual science has not 
changed, but the rhetoric has gotten 
more shrill.”

Though his views are anathema to 
many environmentalists, Mendelsohn 
has always loved the outdoors. He 
often invites his doctoral students 
to barbecues, hikes on the trails in 
his neighborhood, and kayaking 
excursions 
around 
Thimble 
Islands in the Long Island Sound. A 
New York City native, Mendelsohn 
has now traded life in the city for life 
in the Connecticut countryside. He 
enjoys running through the wetlands 
and forests along the old Farmington 
Canal.

“He clearly cares about the 
environment.  My impression is that 
he just wants to make sure we’re being 
smart about how we’re managing 
it,” said David Keiser, a Forestry 
School doctoral student working with 
Mendelsohn. 

Mendelsohn first began studying 
environmental 
economics 
as 
a 
doctoral candidate at Yale in the late 
1970’s, just as climate change was first 
becoming a political issue. His current 
research focuses on the economics of 
climate change on a global scale. He 
and his colleagues have already created 
a model to predict the costs and the 
benefits of climate change in each 
country based on its geography. They 
are now working on more specific 
predictions for much smaller regions.

All climate change economists 
have to make decisions about how to 
weigh particular costs and benefits in 
their analyses. These weightings are 
called ‘discount rates’ in the world of 
climate change economics. One of the 
more difficult problems for climate 
change economists is determining to 
what extent our human desires and 
biases should affect their discount 
rates. For example, knowing that we 
tend to care more about our present 
welfare than we do about the future, 
Mendelsohn uses numbers that place 
less importance on the welfare of 
future generations.

But 
other 
climate 
change 
economists feel an ethical obligation 
to weigh all generations equally. 
“What do we owe to future 
generations? Should we ignore them 
because we are here and they are not?” 
asked Frank Ackerman, the director 
of the Climate Economics Group for 
the Stockholm Environment Institute. 
Ackerman is a prominent advocate 
for more aggressive policies to slow 
global warming. For him, the moral 
responsibility of policy makers and 
those who influence them is clear.

“I cannot stand the idea of being 
a part of the generation that only 
left a degraded planet for its future 
descendants,” he said.  
even argued that climate change will 
benefit agriculture in countries at 
higher latitudes because the growing 
season will be longer, an argument 
Ackerman does not accept.

“A rise in temperature will would 
also affect countries such as the 
United States and Canada, who will 
experience a rise in the number of 
super-hot days that would override 
any potential agricultural benefit of 
a longer growing season. The details 
matter,” said Ackerman. 

Mendelsohn disagrees and feels 
that many scientists pay too much 
attention to the potential downsides 
of climate change. “Exaggerating 
and accentuating the worst possible 
outcomes of climate change only 
delegitimizes the field as a whole,” he 
said.

It’s difficult to be entirely objective 
in climate change economics, however, 
especially considering what is at stake. 
Researchers like Mendelsohn, as well 
as policymakers and voters, have to 
think about every possible outcome, 
no matter how extreme. Their 
conclusions will ultimately depend on 
whose welfare they most value—that 
of future generations, that of people 
in developing countries, or their own.
