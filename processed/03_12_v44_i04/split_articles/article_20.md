t is Valentine’s Day in Jack’s first-
grade class. A few at a time, his 
classmates get up to hand out 
their valentines, effortlessly matching 
names with the faces of their 
classmates until, empty-handed, they 
dart back to their seats. Jack glances 
down at the name on the top of his 
stack and wanders the maze of desks, 
staring intently, not at the children’s 
faces, but at the brown paper bags on 
each desk.

“He’d look at the kid; then he’d 
look at the bag to see the name. He 
didn’t know, ‘Oh that kid who’s been 
sitting at that desk for six months—I 
know who that is,’ ” recalled Jack’s 
mother, Jean Winegardner, who was 
helping out in his Bethesda, Maryland 
public school that day. 

Once home, Jean took each of 
the valentines Jack’s classmates had 
given him and asked him to describe 
the child who made it. He couldn’t. 
Jack had been in class with the same 
children 
since 
kindergarten 
and 
was quick to correct his mother’s 
pronunciation of the names, but could 
not connect any name to a single detail 
about any of his classmates. 

Jack has a lot of trouble with 
social interaction, clings to strict 
routines (for a long time he only ate 
foods that were brown, for example), 
and had trouble learning to speak 
when he was younger. Since the age 
of five he has had a diagnosis on the 
spectrum of autistic disorders. But in 
a little more than a year, his specific 
diagnosis, Pervasive Developmental 
Disorder Not Otherwise Specified 
(PDD-NOS), will not exist. Neither 
will the related and better-known 
diagnosis of Asperger’s Syndrome.  

A group of psychiatrists are 
working on radical changes to the 
words that define the diagnoses that 
make up Autism Spectrum Disorder. 
The changes at first might seem 
esoteric, affecting just a few pages in a 
dense volume known as the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, or DSM. But for autism, 
words are key. The disorder cannot be 
diagnosed by a blood test or a brain 
scan. Change the DSM definition, 
which is the authoritative guide to the 
diagnosis of mental disorders, and 
you change who is considered to have 
the condition. 

The impending changes may 
make the definition significantly 
more stringent. To those who believe 
doctors have created an “autism 
epidemic” by handing out too many 
diagnoses to children with marginal 
impairments, the shift represents an 
opportunity to bring order to an out-
of-control situation. To advocates for 
autistic children and their families, 
the proposals threaten to deprive 
hundreds of thousands of children 
and adults of badly needed services 
and a label that has become central to 
their identities. 

The debate, which until recently 
was largely confined to academic 
circles, has attracted increasing public 
attention with the release of new data 
by two Yale experts on autism. During 
a presentation at the conference of 
the Icelandic Medical Association 
in January, Fred Volkmar and James 
McPartland announced that their 
study showed that more than half 
of children with normal or high IQs 
who are currently diagnosed with 
autism spectrum disorders no longer 
would qualify under the proposed 
new definitions. The study itself is 
currently under review by the Journal 
of the American Academy of Child 
and Adolescent Psychiatry, and is 
embargoed until publication in April.

“The sad thing is for many more 
able kids, because you see how smart 
they are, you don’t see how socially 
impaired they are,” said Volkmar, 
chief of child psychiatry at Yale-
New Haven Children’s Hospital and 
chairman of the Yale Child Study 
Center. 

“One might argue, if you have 
a system that’s working pretty well, 
why mess with it?” Volkmar asked. 
Eighteen years ago, Volkmar headed 
the committee that last rewrote the 
definition of autism when the current 
version of the DSM, the DSM-IV, 
was written. The main goal then, he 
said, was to broaden the spectrum 
so that individuals with higher IQs 
could receive the benefits of having a 
diagnosis. 

He continues to see the existing 
definitions as a significant success. 
In a recent interview, he leaned back 
in his chair and spread his long arms 
to indicate the inclusiveness of the 
spectrum his committee designed 
eighteen years ago, then folded them 
over his rotund belly. “It would be 
nice to be able to get help to people 
who want it,” he said.

Michael John Carley, for one, 
believes cutting anyone off the autism 
spectrum entirely would be a tragedy. 
Carley is the head of the Global 
and Regional Asperger’s Syndrome 
Partnership, or GRASP, which is the 
largest organization of adults with 
autistic disorders. He was diagnosed 
with Asperger’s as an adult just a 
week after his son was diagnosed 
with autism. His own experiences 
and those of the other members of 
his organization have made Carley 
keenly aware of the sense of identity 
a diagnosis brings, and the large, 
supportive communities it can form. 
He said in November that he had been 
reassured about the proposed new 
standards. “Every expert has told me, 
don’t worry about it, it’s not going to 
happen,” he said then.

Several days after Volkmar and 
McPartland presented their study 
in Iceland, though, Carley indicated 
concern. “We’re a little surprised by 
this turn. I don’t think anybody told 
me an untruth necessarily, but clearly 
something inside that room has 
changed,” he said. “We couldn’t more 
strongly disagree,” he added.

“The intention of the committee 
was not to change the rate of autism 
spectrum disorders, but rather to make 
the criteria better match up to what 
clinicians actually do,” said Catherine 
Lord, a member of the American 
Psychiatric Association committee 
that is revising the criteria for the new 
version of the manual, which will 
be called the DSM-5. She feels that 
while “the DSM-IV criteria were a real 
improvement,” they left too much up 
to the arbitrary judgment of clinicians. 
The new criteria are an attempt to
