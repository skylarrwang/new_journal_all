A
t the Maritime Aquarium 
in 
Norwalk, 
Connecticut, 
a work crew is preparing 
a large, empty room for new shark 
tanks and sea urchin habitats with 
state-of-the-art 
filtration 
systems. 
They’ve been told to be unobtrusive, 
so the workers speak softly and crane 
operators silently ease thousand-
pound slabs of concrete into position. 
Several hundred people still visit the 
aquarium each day, and the sounds of 
heavy machinery in the background 
wouldn’t be ideal for a leisurely family 
outing.


“We 
spent 
the 
last 
decade expanding our educational 
programming and varieties of species. 
It’s time our facilities get a face-lift, 
too,” said Dave Sigworth, a spokesman 
for the Maritime Aquarium. During 
his fourteen years working there, he 
has witnessed the aquarium become 
a popular destination for families 
touring New England. There are 
about 85,000 people in Norwalk, 
but the aquarium now welcomes 
almost half a million visitors a year. 
At a September celebration of the 
launch of the $4 million renovation 
project, a shoal of notable people—
Norwalk 
Mayor 
Richard 
Mocci, 
aquarium president Jennifer Herring, 
U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, 
and Robert Forrester, president of 
Newman’s Own Foundation—floated 
toy sharks in the old tanks. 


“The event symbolized how 
much we can give to visitors locally 
and to Connecticut,” Sigworth said. 
The aquarium’s history is a remarkable 
success story. Local governments and 
nonprofit organizations invested in a 
community and created a major center 
of economic activity, all while teaching 
New England’s children about the 
ecology of the Long Island Sound. 
The blocks around the aquarium, 
once run down and largely derelict, 
are now the most valuable commercial 
real estate in the city. But the aquarium 
has sailed only recently from rougher 
waters. 


I
’d always heard that [the Aquarium] 
wasn’t pulling in much money back 
in the early nineties, but they have 
to be making lots of money now,” 
says Donna Rey, a third-generation 
Norwalk resident. “I mean, I bring my 
two kids here every weekend. They’re 
nuts about the ray eels.” Moray eels, or 
ray eels for short, are spineless, with 
dinosaur faces attached to flattened, 
finless bodies.


Her two toddlers tug at the 
fabric of her pants, their eyes flitting 
ceaselessly toward the puffer fish 
floating in a central glass column. One 
launches his body into an imitation of 
an orca whale, and his brother waves 
his arms to mimic ocean tides. 


Rey and her husband were both 
raised in Norwalk, and she remembers 
the aquarium’s opening in July 1988, 
back when it was called simply “The 
Maritime Center.”


A mere three months after it 
opened, the center was mired in “a 
fiscal and financial crisis,” according 
to the city’s finance director then. The 
problem was that not enough people 
were coming to the aquarium.


When city officials approved 
proposals to build the seventy 
thousand square-foot museum and 
aquarium in old factory buildings, they 
hoped visitors would return to a once 
thriving and eclectic part of town, an 
area known as the Washington Strip. 
Population drift had left the area 
deserted and the economy crippled. 
The 
proposed 
Maritime 
Center 
appeared to fuse educational and 
environmental objectives with the 
potential to make money. Biologists 
liked the idea of teaching people 
about flora and fauna in the Long 
Island Sound, while economists and 
city planners nodded at the proposed 
center’s family appeal.


Families 
didn’t 
come, 
though, and as sponsors began to 
lose hope that the center would 
become financially self-sustaining, 
the city government stepped in and 
offered the Maritime Center a $30 
million advance to cover maintenance 
costs and, most importantly, start 
advertising. It was a big gamble.


Pete Marnane, who became 
president a few years later, proposed 
a name change. He believed the 
aquarium should be able to attract 25 
million visitors in five decades, but 
he thought that the “The Maritime 
Center” was too humdrum, not a 
name that would prompt families to 
pull off the Connecticut Turnpike, the 
only major highway nearby. Marnane 
wanted his facility to be a destination 
that parents would plan afternoons 
around. He wanted his aquarium to be 
called an aquarium.  


“I wanted to make sure we were 
planning ahead,” he said. His staff 
spent months surveying visitors, 
until they convinced aquarium board 
members that changing one word 
would bring in 10 percent more 
visitors. The name changed in April 
1996. In the following year visitors to 
the new “Maritime Aquarium” more 
than doubled.


Marnane spent the remainder of 
his tenure addressing every funding 
request, every remodeling initiative, 
every addition to the aquarium, and 
every new crustacean tank with his 
characteristic diligence. “Pete turned 
things around for us. Everyone knew 
that, and none of us wanted him to 
leave the aquarium,” Sigworth said. 
Eventually, 
Marnane 
stepped 
down. He purchased a small Tudor 
house and quietly raised his family, 
making 
occasional 
appearances 
at the annual Norwalk Memorial 
and 
Independence 
Day 
Parades 
and business ribbon-cuttings. He 
purchased a tank and filter for his 
home, but never got around to buying 
any fish to fill it. 


T
he Sound is a lot like Vegas,” 
Sigworth said. “What happens 
there, and comes by way of the 
rivers, stays there. And we become 
responsible for taking care of it.” 
The Long Island Sound loses 
several of its unique species every 
year 
to 
overfishing 
water 
pollution. The Maritime Aquarium 
finds no shortage of conservation 
topics to inspire its in-house and off-
site programming, serving 150,000 
students in Connecticut each year. In 
2002, it unveiled two lab classrooms 
on the third floor. Colorful diagrams 
of crustacean life cycles span three 
walls, and a long stretch of sinks, tubs, 
and tanks lines the fourth. As students 
rinse their hands after playing with 
turtles or poking at sea cucumbers, 
they can look out the south-facing 
window at the Norwalk River, perhaps 
at the very place where biologists 
gathered the specimens for that day’s 
workshop. 


The aquarium’s economic impact 
eventually caught up to its educational 
outreach. Today, the area around the 
aquarium boasts a swanky Italian 
ristorante and several smaller shops 
offering stationery and fashions by 
local and national designers.


Ike Litovsky waits tables at 
O’Neill’s, a pub a few blocks away 
from the aquarium. Between his lunch 
and dinner shifts, Litovsky visits the 
aquarium and takes in an occasional 
IMAX matinee.


Many of the guests at O’Neill’s 
have just visited the aquarium, 
Litovsky said. “I tell them we offer 
fresh cod that’s been dropped off to 
us that morning by harbor fishermen, 
but some people give me this funny 
look like, ‘I just saw those happily 
swimming around with their marine 
friends; no way—get me a steak.’ 
Others go crazy and get seafood 
platters.” 


Litovsky wouldn’t mind moving 
a few blocks for work. “I’d love to 
work for them,” he said. “This town, 
this restaurant, needs that aquarium.” 
The aquarium is looking for “people 
who get what works here,” he added. 
“I think they just really want people 
who care enough to stick around. Sign 
me up.”


Thirty-six 
percent 
of 
aquarium’s approximately 475,000 
visitors each year come from out of 
the state. As it continues to expand, 
the aquarium is set to meet Manarne’s 
target of 25 million visitors in five 
decades. Over the last two decades, 
various donors have sunk nearly $335 
million into the aquarium, which 
generates an estimated $42 million of 
economic activity in the city every year. 
The current executive board includes 
state councilmen and public servants 
of surrounding municipalities. 


The Maritime Aquarium brought 
new life to the surrounding district. 
Now, as the quieter winter season 
drags on, the city will return the favor 
with new underwater homes for the 
aquarium’s toothiest denizens.
