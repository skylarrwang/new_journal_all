syringes after using them, for fear of 
police harassment.
The idea behind a one-for-one 
exchange is that it prevents people 
from accidentally getting pricked by 
needles discarded on the streets or 
in parks. Kaveh Khoshnood SPH ’89 
GRD ’95, a professor of epidemiology 
and public health at the Yale School 
of Medicine, explained to me that this 
concern is only so legitimate. The risk 
of someone getting infected by an 
accidental needle stick is not zero, but 
it’s incredibly low.

In Windham, Connecticut, a 
syringe exchange program was shut 
down in 1997 because a child was 
accidentally stuck while playing in her 
backyard. “Politicians who don’t like 
syringe exchanges made a huge deal 
out of the fact that discarded syringes 
were here and there,” Khoshnood 
said. “And somehow they pushed this 
story. They didn’t understand syringe 
exchange or didn’t want to.”

I
n 1993, Altice started a mobile 
healthcare
prog ram—the 
Community Health Care Van. Its 
history is closely linked to that of the 
syringe exchange van. 
When the syringe exchange 
program was started, its initiators 
knew that the drug users it served 
needed more than clean needles. 
Altice began the Community Health 
Care Van to meet those needs, initially 
providing HIV testing and counseling, 
social services, and basic primary 
care. He waited three years after the 
syringe exchange was established to 
enact the plan. “Needle exchange 
was so polarized as an issue for the 
communities. At the outset, there was 
a concern of not doing anything more 
than syringe exchange just to prove it 
worked,” said Altice. “We did not want 
to destabilize the process by 
adding on too many different 
things.” 

By 
mid-1992, 
the 
effectiveness of the syringe 
exchange 
program 
was 
well 
established. 
Without 
any outside funding, Altice 
assembled 
Community 
Health Care Van. The vehicle 
was donated to him.  Altice was 
the doctor on board. Yale-New 
Haven Hospital sent a social 
worker, and the New Haven 
Health Department sent an 
HIV counselor. In the first year, 
the van went out once a week, 
following the syringe exchange 
van to each stop. Clients could 
go get their syringes and then walk 
over to the Community Health Care 
Van for assistance with medical issues. 
While the Community Health 
Care Van worked directly with the 
syringe exchange van, Altice never 
intended to be the same kind of state-
funded initiative. “At the time, the 
health department was just not in a 
position to do anything more than it 
was doing,” Altice explained. His use 
of private funding was “the only way 
it would have happened.” 

The van’s history has been one 
of growth. By collecting data on 
the van’s services, Altice was able to 
gain grants to expand its programs. 
The van was on the streets five days 
a week by 1996. Today, it offers an 
programs. While he recognized that 
the programs helped slow the spread 
of HIV, he refused to lift the ban on 
federal funding for syringe exchanges 
that had been in place since 1988. In 
2002, Clinton said that he had made 
a mistake in not supporting syringe 
exchanges during his presidency. 

The Bush Administration did not 
express support for syringe exchange 
programs.

The New Haven program also 
did not live up to initial expectations. 
Funding was perpetually an issue. 
Staff numbers declined. Hours 
were cut. The vehicle suffered 
from mechanical problems. 
Frederick Altice, professor 
at Yale School of Medicine who 
has been involved in research 
on HIV/AIDS and substance 
use in New Haven for over 
two decades, noticed a gradual 
decline in the city’s syringe 
exchange program beginning 
in 1993. “Then, from about 
1998 to 2000, I think you saw 
a major decline. I think from 
2003, they’ve really struggled 
continuously.” 

Bucheli hopes that the 
program can find new sources 
of money other than state 
funding.  The program has recently 
received a new supervisor, Brooke 
Logan, and she’s supposed to be good 
at grant writing. “The thing that’s 
bad with that is that they’re putting 
that federal ban back in place,” said 
Bucheli. “Now it’s over. Unbelievable. 
Stupid. We’re all going to die.”

It’s clear that Bucheli is upset 
when 
barriers 
stop 
him 
from 
distributing syringes. The program 
operates as a one-for-one exchange. 
Clients can only receive as many 
syringes as they bring back. Clients 
might come without syringes, or 
without as many as they need, because 
they are distributing clean syringes to 
friends who don’t return them. And 
they don’t want to be in possession of 

“Why has 20 years 
of evidence, 
continued advocacy, 
and support not 
done the job? At 
some point, it’s 
just politics.”

expanded range of services, including 
drug and HIV treatment, tuberculosis 
testing, vaccinations, and mental 
health services. The program owns 
a beautiful, forty-foot mobile clinic, 
complete with examination and intake 
rooms. 

When the syringe exchange van 
has struggled, the Community Health 
Care Van has stepped in to fill the 
void. Until the early 2000’s, the two 
vans still went to all of the same stops, 
but variability in the syringe exchange 
van’s 
schedule 
due 
to 
funding 
issues made this challenging. The 
Community Health Care Van started 
to work independently.  

“Their hours were cut, their van 
was broken down, they just weren’t 
out on the streets,” Altice said of 
the syringe exchange program at that 
time. “We would have a lot of drug 
users who would come in for health 
services, who were essentially saying, 
‘We don’t know what to do. We would 
like clean syringes.’ ”

In Connecticut, only licensed 
providers 
could 
legally 
perform 
syringe exchange. The Community 
Health Care Van did not qualify as a 
licensed provider, but Altice figured 
out another way to make sure users 
were getting clean needles. He 
discovered clinicians could legally 
prescribe needles for HIV prevention, 
and so the van started doing this in 
2002. 

I asked Altice what might be 
done so that Obama repeals the ban 
in his proposed budget for the fiscal 
year 2013. 

“You mean why has 20 years of 
evidence, continued advocacy, and 
support not done its job?” he replied. 
“At some point, it’s just politics.”


n the United States today, there are 
221 syringe exchange programs in 
thirty-three states and the District of 
Columbia. It is not known how many 
have received federal funding since 
the original ban was repealed in 2009. 

“When Obama allowed federal 
funds to be used for syringe exchange, 
he didn’t actually allocate any new 
funds,” explained Khoshnood. “In a 
sense, I don’t think much happened 
between when he announced it and 
when the Republican Congress just 
reinstated the ban.”

As a student at Yale School of 
Public Health in the late eighties, 
Khoshnood was involved in the 
underground syringe exchange in 
New Haven. He participated in the 
initial evaluation of the demonstration 
program, and has researched HIV/
AIDS ever since. 

“In some ways, it’s kind of back 
to square one. It’s unbelievable that in 
2012 we have to go right back to what 
we were doing in the late eighties and 
early nineties—remind government 
officials that this saves lives, does not 
increase drug use, saves money—and 
it’s a little surreal,” said Khoshnood. 

Scientific research is one way 
to appreciate the value of syringe 
exchange programs; a second is the 
people they affect. 

To Bucheli, every syringe makes a 
difference. His ideal syringe exchange 
would be one that is open twenty-
four hours a day. He wishes there was 
a hotline program, where drug users 
could call for syringes and a program 
staff member would go meet them 
with the requested supplies. 

“Sometimes I think I enable,” 
he said. “But then I figure I’m giving 
them a clean needle, so it’s a thin line. 
It’s hard to stop getting high once you 
start. It was very hard for me to stop, 
took years.” 

T
he Community Health Care Van 
and the syringe exchange van 
still do share a stop, on the corner of 
Chatham and Ferry in Fair Haven. It’s 
a high drug use and prostitution area, 
so it’s a good location. 

I went there with Bucheli from 
Grand and Ferry. The Community 
Health Care Van was parked on the 
other corner, looking dry, warm, and 
inviting in the cold weather. If a client 
comes on with health problems at this 
location, Bucheli walks them over to 
the other van. We walk over too, to say 
hello. 

Bucheli left Chatham and Ferry 
to pick up some donations. He also 
was dropping me off back at Yale—I 
wasn’t going to find a cab willing to 
pick me up at Chatham and Ferry, he 
said. 

“I appreciate you coming and 
asking questions,” Bucheli said. He 
brought up his HIV status. “You can 
put it in there if you want. I think 
if other people know, it’s not such a 
bad thing, ’cause it kind of felt good 
telling you. Maybe that should be in 
the article. Makes sense.”

Ten minutes later, he dropped 
me off on York and Chapel, an 
intersection very different from the 
one from which we had arrived. I 
watched the van pull away, loaded 
with its cargo of clean syringes to 
distribute.
