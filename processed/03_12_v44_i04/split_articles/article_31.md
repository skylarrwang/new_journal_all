EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
First, a chronology of my athletic 
career:
1997: At the age of five, I set 
out to become a professional wrestler 
and superhero. Though I dominate 
the 37-pound circuit for a while, I 
develop no powers. Also, I discover 
professional wrestlers fake it.

1998: Tee-ball is much harder 
than it looks.

1999-2006: I sit inside my house 
and read, avoiding sunlight if possible.

2007-2009: For three years, I try 
to make the varsity soccer team and 
be a coordinated person girls will like. 
Alas, no.

2010: My new goal, as a senior in 
high school, is to run five kilometers 
at a reasonable pace without Death 
casting her cold shadow over my pale, 
skinny, ill-clad body. But Delaware 
has a lot of hills. A LOT OF HILLS. 
I end the cross-country season five-
foot-eleven and 125 pounds with ten 
black toenails.

That autumn, I affixed a chin-up 
bar to my door, hoping to attach a 
few scraps of muscle to my skeleton. 
With push-ups and crunches and curls 
and crunches and more crunches, 
I packed on more tone than the 
average Kenyan marathoner, but I still 
wasn’t in underwear model territory. 
Desperate, I decided to Bing “how to 
build muscle” and started to read. 
“Food! I forgot about eating 
food!”

The sites that came up were full 
of helpful advice. By February, I’d 
settled into a rhythm: eat, work out 
(biceps, triceps, biceps, triceps, biceps, 
biceps), 
eat, 
read 
Bodybuilding.
com, sleep, repeat. I was better at 
the reading part than the others. My 
epiphanies multiplied. I realized I had 
muscles in my legs, too. I learned that 
I was using my spine to lift.

Before long, I was a genuine 
expert on weightlifting. I was doing 
thoughtful, 
smooth, 
full-body 
workouts every few days and eating 
through half the family grocery 
budget (we have three kids and a 
spoiled cat). Then came the move to 
Yale. A gym in the basement! More 
food than I could eat! And, of course, 
the Yale Powerlifters.

By mid-September I was hanging 
out with people who could squat 
a barbell weighing as much as me 
on either end. I learned more in a 
month of practice than I had in a 
year of watching people lift things on 
YouTube (unexpectedly engrossing, if 
you’ve never tried it). I knew enough 
now to be concerned for the other 
lifters at Payne-Whitney. Picking up 
heavy things is a lot like taming lions 
or walking tightropes—you won’t 
look cool until you do it properly, and 
doing it any other way will probably 
get you hurt. 

The average male training plan 
seems to devote two days each to 
arms and chest and three to abs—the 
only muscle group that really doesn’t 
get any larger on an average human. 
Or, as Olympic weightlifting champ 
Alison James ’12 said, “So many guys 
apparently think it’s attractive to have 
an unnaturally inflated chest and arms 
that sits on top of a pair of chicken 
legs.” 

The average female training 
plan involves jogging, and maybe 
some breaks for combination squat-
curl-lateral raises with ten-pound 
dumbbells, preferably while standing 
on an exercise ball, giving the wall 
mirrors a death stare, and trying not 
to breathe, lest she grunts. The most 
common male movement, conversely, 
is the “bicep jerk”—like a curl, but 
of the entire body, and with twice the 
weight he knows he can handle.  

I soon left the team over a 
difference in weightlifting philosophy.
The Powerlifters’ goal is to be as 
strong as possible. Buffness is only a 
secondary concern. As their captain 
told the News, “Why am I going to care 
about looking strong, if I’m not going 
to be strong?” I take a different view. 
Like 90 percent of Yale gymgoers, I 
exercise mainly for the sake of the 
opposite sex (or, given lack of success 
on that front, mirrors). I wanted to 
go from beanpole to bruiser—stick 
to brick—geek to freak. Bench-
pressing three hundred pounds held 
no inherent appeal for me.  

Since then, I’ve taken up the 
most 
efficient 
possible 
weight-
training system: a few carefully chosen 
exercises, ninety seconds apiece, with 
a weight heavy enough to drive my 
muscles past pain into total shutdown. 
Bodybuilding pioneer Arthur Jones 
summed up this system’s philosophy: 
“If you’ve never vomited from doing 
a set of bicep curls, then you’ve never 
experienced outright hard work.”

The first few workouts were the 
closest I’ve gotten to an out-of-body 
experience, but my once-infantile pain 
tolerance is creeping upward. You 
could say I’ve traded my irony for 
iron, but that still sounds ironic, so I’ll 
stop before I drop a joke on my foot 
or something. From now on, I’ll just 
keep to my new plan and lift. 

So if you’re ever passing through 
the basement of Timothy Dwight 
and hear what sounds like a werewolf 
transforming, it’s just me on the leg 
press, getting ready for my next tête-
à-tête with my favorite mirror. And of 
course, working toward my latest goal:
2012: Just be a decent person 
without letting life get me down. Also, 
become an underwear model.

**Title: JOSH PLAUT
1969 - 2011**

J
oshua Andrew Plaut – or Josh Plaut, as he was known to his friends and in his 
byline – came to Yale as a freshman in Timothy Dwight College in 1987.

Back then, The New Journal was a well-established alternative to the News or the 
relatively new Yale Herald. Although we composed our articles on our clunky, first 
generation Apple Macs, we didn’t have desktop publishing and  would send our small 
floppy disks to a printer, getting back rolls of shiny printed columns that we would 
painstakingly paste onto graph paper. Over one sleepless weekend, the whole staff 
would gather at a local architectural office, proof reading every article and cutting 
typos out of the pages with razor blades. It seemed like Steely Dan was always playing 
on a boom box, and there was a seemingly bottomless box of Entenmann’s chocolate 
chip cookies and too much Diet Coke lying around on the tables. Nobody had cell 
phones, so it was hard for our roommates or friends to reach us.

Josh, a lacrosse player from Summit, N.J. with a feisty mind and a sharp wit, 
had all the elements of a good writer: curiosity about worlds he was not a part of, 
discipline and determination, and many lovely turns of phrase.

One of his first major features for The New Journal was “Tattoo Uncovered” in 
April 1989, a portrait of several New Haven tattoo artists and their clients. In the first 
paragraph, he described a tattoo artist named Spider Webb inscribing a tiger head on 
a woman’s shoulder. “Staccato bursts from the gun drown out the strains of Poison’s 
‘Fallen Angel’ pouring out of a color television set,” Josh wrote.

His senior year, Josh became a managing editor of The New Journal. He always 
kept us laughing during ridiculous all-night editing sessions where we labored for 
hours over one paragraph that we had to get just right. He went on snack runs to 
WaWa’s at 2 a.m. He wrote many of the best headlines.

And he rescued a few stories in desperate need of an injection of his humor. He 
also skewered pretention and gave blunt, though never painful, criticism.

After college, Josh did a brief stint at a Scholastic magazine before going on to 
make news as a spokesman for the Department of Education. In his 30s, he went to 
law school at Fordham and Columbia, and in law firm jobs he was known as a talented 
writer. He was very proud when a sentence from one of his briefs was quoted in a 
judge’s decision. And in emails to friends, he occasionally corrected what he regarded 
as imprecision or exaggeration.

Josh was a wonderful writer and a dear friend. He loved The New Journal. He was 
proud of its continuing excellence and a loyal donor. We will miss him.
