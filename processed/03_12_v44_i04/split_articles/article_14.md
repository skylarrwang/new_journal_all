**Cheeseboy and the Golden Sandwiches**

The Connecticut Post Mall in 
Milford is not a remarkable place. It 
is not beautiful. It is grey and flat and 
illumined by cold fluorescent lights. I 
stepped off an escalator, crossed that 
sorriest of American public spaces—
the food court—and approached the 
Cheeseboy counter. When a beaming 
young employee appeared and said, 
with real enthusiasm, “Have you ever 
been here before?” I suddenly felt 
everything was going to be all right.

He shepherded me through my 
order—American cheese on Italian 
bread with tomato and bacon—rolled 
the bread across some nifty cylinders 
covered in melted butter, piled on the 
ingredients, and stuffed the result in 
an industrial-strength panini press. A 
golden-brown sandwich emerged not 
two minutes later. It was, needless to 
say, delicious. Somehow, there in the 
Connecticut Post Mall, I had found 
a remarkable restaurant, a beautiful 
grilled cheese sandwich, and evidence 
of good old Yankee ingenuity.

Cheeseboy is a young and 
rapidly expanding company that 
operates “quick-service restaurants” 
specializing in grilled cheese. It is 
also the nickname of the company’s 
cheese-crazy founder and president, 
Michael Inwald SOM ’10. 
“The 
goal 
to 
be 
preeminent grilled cheese franchise 
concept in this country,” Inwald 
explained. He described himself 
as a serial entrepreneur. “I have 
entrepreneurship in my bones to the 
core,” he said. He has also been, as 
he puts it, “obsessed with cheese” 
his whole life, and claims to have 
lived on grilled cheese sandwiches 
through college and beyond, refining 
his preparation technique all the while. 
Inwald’s Cheeseboy has channeled his 
passions for entrepreneurship and 
cheese toward a single cause, and it 
has placed him on the short list of 
Yale entrepreneurs who have launched 
successful startups while still enrolled 
as students.

Inwald first arrived at the 
Cheeseboy concept all the way back 
in 2004, when friends encouraged 
him to market his grilled cheese, but 
he shelved the idea in order to go 
to business school. And from his 
undergrad years at Cornell— “a liberal 
arts education creates a well-rounded 
base from which you can grow”—to 
the stressful experience of launching 
a small production company right out 
of college, to the years he spent in 
retail and advertising—he insists that 
every stage of his meandering journey 
has helped prepare him to launch and 
run a successful company. 

Inwald sees his passion and the 
uniqueness of his concept at the core 
of Cheeseboy’s success. “I’m one 
of the few entrepreneurs who had 
a passion for something that hadn’t 
been truly explored,” he said. He’s 
just as quick, though, to point out 
the importance of the Yale resources 
he drew on. “I was very different 
from many MBA classmates, set 
on entrepreneurship from the day I 
started at SOM.” He said that focus 
allowed him to make better use than 
his classmates of what the School had 
to offer. “Take basic accounting,” he
