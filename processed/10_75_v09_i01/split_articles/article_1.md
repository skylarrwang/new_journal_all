Amateur romantics coming home to 
Cambridge England thumbed a ride 
from a beat up MG. " Don't mind the 
equipment, ifs just a project rm 
working on,·· the driver said. 

"Oh. ·· Climbing in carefully one 
romantic guessed along. ''Are you an 
engineer?"' 

" I work with engineers. We've 
invented a machine that generates 
negative ions. It gives the air around a 
slight negative charge and has a strange 
effect on the people nearby.·· 

"Oh yeah?"' The driver nodded to 
their open dgarette packs. The roman-
tics smiled and handed one over. 

"Thank you. We found that a 
negative charge, a small one, makes 
people happy. At the office, when we 
tum on the machine secretaries start 
singing, people talk to one another, 
everybody smiles. lfs marvelous. 

"And a slight positive charge en-
forces depression. You find positive 
charges near tall buildings surrounded 
by concrete where tires grind in the 
streets. They have done studies on 
people who work in sky scrapers. They 
aren't very happy.·· 

"So where do you find negative 
ions?·· 

"The ideal, natural, negatively 
charged spot is near a waterfall or 
stream where water flows over rocks.·· 

"You mean there's a chemical reason 
for liking waterfalls? .. 

"It's all in the ions. Germans blame 
all kinds of things on a hot wind called 
das Fohn. Surgeons won't operate, 
committees won't meet, the crime rate 
goes up and suicides increase. That 
wind you see is full of positive ions. 
The same wind in Africa is called the 
Sirocco. But we·ve got the cure, the 
Happy Box, a negative ion generator.·· 

.. and if you're feeling depressed-·· 

" But it's not perfected. That will take 
a lot of time and money ... ··

really took place.
