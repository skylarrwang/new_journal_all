• perusal of the outside comer of the 
envelope proved she was writing from 
somewhere in Ploughkeepsie, New 
York and that Harold lived in the 
Bahamas. " I guess they must com-
mute,·· thought our hero. " But how did 
the letter end up here?"" 

Albert ran back to his room and 
began composing a letter. He worked 
four hours beffore he hit on exactly 
what he wanted. When he did, the 
message was short and to the point. 
"Dear Bertha,·· it said. " How about 
this weekend?"· and he mailed it. For 
the rest of the day, he forgot to think 
about Alison. 

But by the next day, when he"d 
received two more letters from Bertha, 
exhorting him in increasingly unreserved 
language to indulge in unrestrained acts . 
of legal and illegal passion, he began to 
4 
wonder if Allison was really his one and 
only. For Albert had never gotten such 
things through the mail before. And 
quickly, without realizing it, he began 
to fall in love. 

He continued to write to Bertha, 
sending epistles no more reserved than 
hers, signing them Harold, giving them 
Harold"s return address. After two 
weeks, he could stand it no longer. 
"Dear Bertha,· · he wrote. "I have a 
Harold. I am Albert. I have been 
writing these letters. My real address is 
not in the Grand Caymans but at 1000 
B.C. Yale Station and I am madly in 
love with you-stupidly in Jove with 
you-
tragically in love with you-and 
hope to hear from you soon. Passionate-
ly yours, Albert.·· 

He thrust the letter in the mail box 
and awaited the reply. Naturally, the 
next two days continued the red flood of 
passion from Bertha. But then lhere 
was a mysterious pause in her push. 
Then a silence. An ominous breaking 
off. 

For three weeks, Albert"s box 
remained empty. He wrote pained sad 
crazy letters to Allison. Then one day, a 
little brown envelope landed in the box, 
mailed from somewhere in the mysteri-
ous orient. 
"What" s this?"· he cried, ripping it 
open. 

"Dear Albert, .. it said. "Thank you. 
You· ve provided me with the two most 
wonderful girls in the whole wide 
world. I would nave never met Allison 
without you-neither would I have had 
the courage to write what I presume you 
must have written Bertha. I appreciate 
it. I reallY. do. Harold.·· 

Albert stood stunned as a piece of 
green paper fluttered out from behind 
the letter. He picked it up and stared at 
it, uncomprehendingly. Then he noticed 
a P.S. on the letter. 
" P.s.;· the letter read. "To show 
you my appreciation, I enclose this 
$10,000 check.·· And he looked at the 
check and right there at the top was 
Harold"s Bahamas address, and his 
Arabian address, and his Arizona 
address and above that it read Harold 
and then it read Hughes. 
"Gee, .. said Albert. " I guess I won "t 
be getting any more mail for a while.··

Beauty Contest 
This marks our debut as a forum for 
brief contemporary opinion on a wide 
variety of timely topics. This month we 
asked friends for their definitions of 
beauty, and received the following 
replies: 

I would use the same definition I use 
for art, although I avoid definition: that 
which enriches the vision. 

Robert L. Herbert, Art History 

There was a time wnen I would have 
said something, but now I"m too old. 

HaroltLBloom, English 

Like all important things, it"s unde-
finable. 

Robert Fogelin, Philosophy 

Beauty is cherries and cheesecake under 
class. 

Bill Jacobs. '76 

Beauty is any number of angels dancing 
on the head of a pin. 

Corby S. Kummer, '78 

Beauty is the constant conversion and 
reconverting of upbeat to downbeat. 

Joan Panetti, Music 

Beauty tS what any generatton nee s tn 
order to face life ... well that"s ... thafs 
almost co~ct. 

Vmcent Scully, Art Htstory 

Look in the mirror. Do you see beauty? 
Do you see ugliness? If you see both, 
you"re all mixed up. 

Jem Winer, '76 

Beauty is a resident of a small town in 
Montana. 

Sue Halpern, '76 

Beauty strikes us immediately in the 
eye, the ear, or wherever, as a 
completed and harmonious whole; yet as 
we continue to consider it, it explands, 
unfolds and shows its infinite 
implications. Often it is the unexpected 
realization of potentiality, be it a student 
discoveringa new idea, house plants 
flourishing despite the neglect of their 
owner, or the moon rising behind the 
Parthenon. 

Ruth S. Day, Psychology 

rm afraid I would not care to define it 
in 25 or even I 00 words or less. If I 
said something serious I couldn "t 
believe it. I suppose I should say 
something funny, but J"m not very good 
at jokes.
