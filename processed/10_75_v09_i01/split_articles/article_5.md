**Title: The ballad of George**
**Author: Bobo Largo**

The ballad of George 
True art which all minstrals mutter 
Finds gold inspiration in the gutter. 
The Muse called Garbagia, 
Sotted drunk's Beatrichia, 
Gives sparks to the words that I utter. 
o·er high thoughts my brain box has 
run, 
O;.:!r the infinite like rays in the sun. 
Yet it's no weary boast, 
To offer a toast, 
To George the magnificent Egg-man. 
George served eggs in the college of 
Trumbell, 
Kept room in Calhoun, a large double. 
But when stars cut the night, 
He was gone out of sight, 
J.le·s a rumble who funnels steam 
tunnels. 
Twas love he could find underground, 
A love in the crisp air not found. 
A love mightily blest, 
A love fonned in the quest, 
Of a sound sodden dank tunnel round. 
An ideal, say some, must be pure; 
For pedestrians it's a Ford quite sure. 
And Epicurians remark, 
A full banquet's their ark; 
Dull bOors don't give grunts o·er their 
lure. 
And George, well you know his pleasure. 
Tis true it's a rather queer measure. 
··res not much, .. says he, 
Yet we·re all pleased to see, 
He's found substance in platonic treasure. 
.. Tis a rub,"· adds he, "by my grace, 
r· ve been scattered and bothered and 
By blue-suited guards, 
chased, 
Those flat-forehead nards: 
The distain, low cripples, of our race. 
By my tup, aren't those words tOQ harsh? 
" Bless my gall, guess my temper wains 
Tis a pity to VJatch, 
sparse. 
As they snap to the latch. 
Damn them all, they bum red my arse. 
Wily George turns to his tunnel of 
night, 
His broad shoulders betray him no 
He's the wizard renown, 
fright. 
He knows life unsidedown. 
He· s the Magi who in darkness sees 
light. 
Nearing end Muse, but carry this note. 
Tie these lyrics as a wheel of ten 
spokes. 
I know George is rough, 
But remove biting guff, 
Which stabs beauty so strange and 
remote.

''I'd like a new post office box, 
please,·· said Albert the postaphiliac as 
he took out the five dollars now 
necessary to support a junk habit he 
once satisfied for free. The money had 
been hard to come by, true, but Albert 
knew that very soon he would be 
receiving anew those familiar offers 
from magazines, catalogues, charities, 
and religious organizations, those bills 
from the local co-operative store and the 
telephone company, but most of all, 
those batches of gushing sentiment and 
practical hints on housekeeping that 
made up the voluminous letters of his 
most dearly beloved Allison. 

Allison's letters were to the average 
letter what Niagra is to a leaky faucet. 
She was brimming with words, sen-
tences, paragraphs, histories, epics. 
Once she took a roll of toilet paper and 
wrote on the entire length of it and 
mailed it. It took Albert amost a month 
to finish it. 

But her messages had always made 
Albert happy and that was what 
counted,. not the number of words it 
took to do so. 

So Albert laid down the money for 
the post office box and waited for the 
usual two to three day delay as he 
always had in the past. By the third day 
he was in agony, but finaJiy two letters 
came in. He ripped them open. 

The first was made up to look like a 
telegram. It said, "You may have 
already won $1 0,000, · · and went on 
from there. Albert threw it away. He 
wasn't in the mood. The second one 
was pink. ''Thank god,·· he said. " It 
must be Allison ... But the letter was 
short, covering barely half of one page. 
" Dear Harold,·· it read. Tve been 
thinking an awful lot about what you 
said to me, and l"ve decided that you·re 
absolutely right about virginity and I'm 
sorry I put up such a fuss at the beach 
house, but really you weren ·r going 
about it very well. I hope you do better 
next time. Willingly yours, Bertha.·· 

"My name's not Harold;· Albert 
thought. "But who's Bertha? .. A
