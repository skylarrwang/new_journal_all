Fear and Loathing 
at the Yale Co-op 
by Rebecca McCormick 
and Dennis Shasha 
the history 
The strike was set for Wednesday. 
On Tuesday, September 2, students 
jammed the Yale Co-op, eage~ to buy 
books without having to cross picket 
lines. The stri~ke never took place, but 
last minute neg()(iations preventing its 
occurence culminated a series of events 
that effected a major change on the 
structure of the store. 

Low patronage refunds, Co-op board 
reorganization, and board member dis-
satisfaction with Willoughly, general 
manager of the Co-op, falling in rapid 
succession, have upset the store admin-
istration's stability. A multitude of 
.employee grievances set the stage for 
and created a union which was ready to 
call a strike four months after 
being chartered. The Co-op's turbulent 
recent history is uniquely uncharacter-
istic of the store's past. 

The Co-op, originally the Yale 
Cooperative Association, was incor-
porated in I 892 with headquarters in 
Connecticut Hall. By purchasing mem-
bership, people in the Yale community 
became eligible for lower prices on 
basic supplies. In the period from 1892 
to 1929, the store moved from 
Connecticut Hall to High Street, to Elm 
Street, and finaJiy to York Street. But in 
the early 1950's, Co-op management 
was concerned about its York Street 
leases-made with three different non-
Yale landlords-
which would expire in 
1977. At this time, Yale was having 
trouble finding tenants for the commer-
cial space in the Stiles-Morse complex, 
and offered it to the Co-op. The lease 
on the store property provides the only 
official connection between the Co-op 
and the university. 

Still, the Co-op has always had a 
deep-seated spiritual connection with 
Yale, extending even to a Harvard-Yale 
rivalry. A 1960 Co-op newsletter 
defended the relatively small size of 
Yale's Co-op compared with Harvard's 
by saying: "The membership of the 
Haarvard Coop is large, but the average 
Harvard man is more reckless in 
expenditure than the average Yale 
man ... " 

The Co-op board appointed Charles 
Willoughby to his post in 1951 . This 
board in theory is the chief decision-
maker of the enterprise, and represents 
the interests of all Co-op members. (i.e. 
students, faculty, and non-faculty Yale 
staff, currently about 20,000 in all). But 
during most of the time since 
Willoughby's appointment, the Co-op 
board did neither. Until the late 60's, 
the board rubber-stamped Wil-
loughby's decisions, according to some 
present board members. 

Comprised mostly of Yale faculty and 
alumni, the board became something of 
an old Blue fraternity. It met three times 
a year at Mory's and accomplished 
little. Students joined the board by 
nomination and remained through their 
college years. The board reserved the 
right to take them on or to appoint other 
"representatives .. as it chose. 

In the early 60's, a special action of 
the board disallowed even these nomina-
tions. The rationale for this procedure 
seems to have been that the store was 
doing well, and there was no reason for 
non-managers to intrude with its 
management. 

Willoughby's background might also 
have had something to do with the 
board's behavior. Willoughby graduated 
from Yale in 1945, an undergraduate 
football star and a member of the then 
prestigious St. Anthony Hall. After 
ending military service as a 1st 
Lieutenant, he joined Macy's training 
program, coming to the Co-op soon 
after. 

Nevertheless, the halcyon days ended 
in the late 1960's when for a variety of 
reasons the Co-op's fortune took a tum 
for the worse. For instance, the May 
Day demonstrations and early student 
exodus left the Co-op with a month· s 
surplus student-oriented inventory. 

In 1969, money returned to members 
as their patronage refund was $329,000; 
in 1971,$63,000. Recognizing a need 
for reform in the store's administrative 
procedures, elements within the board 
convinced the other members that board 
membership should be determined by 
elections; the first was held in 1973. 

the union 
In November 1974 some employees 
at the Yale Co-op decided to or~anize a 
union local. GraduaJly their grievences 
had accumulated. Dissatisfaction cen-
tered around issues such as wages, 
supervisory policy. job classification 
and promotion, a grievence procedure 
and job security. 

Wages at the Co-op were low, 
ranging from $2.15 to $4.40 per hour, 
according to Jan Wi~ben , now Vice-Pre-
sident of the union local. Approximate-
ly 60 out of the 150 employees earned 
less than $2.25 per hour. Cashiers and 
maintenance personel were the lowest. 
paid employees, and tended to be 
part-time or unskilled workers. But 
more experienced employees in higher 
positions frequently earned little more-
as in the case of Helen Migliore, now 
President of the union local, who was 
earning $2.40 per hour after three years. 

Dissatisfaction over wages was re-
inforced by the disparity between the 
salaries of an average employee and a 
supervisor·or manager. Jan Wieben 
wrote, in a letter to the Yale Daily 
News, " The vast majority of the 
workers make around and under $5,000 
per year, while a small circle of 
management figures, Mr. Willoughby 
included, make salaries ran~ng from 
$20,000 to $35,000 a year. That such a 
discrepancy in pay should exist in a 
store that calls itself a co-op is 
abominable. ' • 

Wages were only part of the picture. 
Some employees felt frustrated because, 
in the words of Wieben, the Co-op was 
" an inefficient, badly run operation," 
lacking a clear, coherent policy. " You 
really couldn't find out what the poli~y 
was • • said Susan Wong, now recording 
secr~tary of the union, because it varied 
" from department to department, from 
supervisor to supervisor." Because there 
were too many supervisors for the 
number of employees, a worker could 
be reprimanded for incorrectly following 
a procedure that had never been 
sufficiently explained. 

Related to this was the lack of a clear 
and impartial policy of promotion. 
·'People would work for years and 
years ... and never get promo~ ." Wong 
explained, ··and then they'd bring in 
someone from the outside.' ' Some 
employees claimed that there was . . 
deliberate discrimination on the bas1s of 
race and sex. According to the Co-op 
workers' newsletter. ''In the course 
book department, only women are hired 
for office worlc and only men are hired 
for floor work. In reality ·these jobs may 
overlap quite a bit ... but the significant 
thing here is that women are paid less 
than men in this department due to 
rather arbitrary classifications ... In 
general, manageme!lt jobs were limited 
lO white men, while the majority of the 
employees were women of diverse 
ethnic origins. 

Another central cause of discontent 
was the lack of job security and a 
grievance procedure. As long as there 
was no way to express complaints 
without fear of reprisals, workers felt , 
no changes could be make. 1be Yale 
students who formed the Yale Commit-
tee to Suppon the Co-op Workers group 
in February 1975 agreed: "What worker 
is going to push a grievance too hard in 
the face of management's unlimited 
right to fire her and replace her with 
one of New Haven's numerous un-
employed?'' 

The union drive began when a group 
of workers, meeting infonnally at each 
other's homes, decided to ask the 
Amalgamated Clothing Workers of 
America (AFL-CIO) to help them 
build a union at the Yale Co-op. The 
umon, one of the two that organJZe 
retail clerks, sent Lany Magarik, a 
fuJI-time ACW A organizer, to advise 
the workers. The initial diffkulties were 
substantial. Many workers were apa-
