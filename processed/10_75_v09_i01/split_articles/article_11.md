EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The New JOMrnai/October 2, 1975 
good old boy from lovely, semi-Dallas, 
Fort Worth, Texas. The main character, 
and narrator, in Dead Solid Perfect is 
Kenny Puckett, Billy Clyde's uncle. 
Kenny is a professional golfer. He is 
not a Jack Nicklaus, nor a Lee Trevino 
against whom he competes in the largest 
professional golf tournament in the 
country. But Kenny is competent 
enough to keep himself rolling in 
Lincoln Continentals, good scotch, and 
good drugs, not to mention the little 
lovelies who follow professional athel-
letes all over the country like their 
cousins in the entertainment tield. The 
outstanding feature of Jenkins' women 
is that they are all as sexually adept and 
open-minded as any middle-aged frust-
rated ex-athelete would like them to be. 
The story of Dead Solid Perfect centers 
around Kenny Puckett's participation in 
the biggest tournament in the country 
with frequent sojourns into his extreme-
) ly humorous and bizarre childhood in 
Fort Worth and the Southwestern 
environs. 

Jenkin's greatest gift is his sense of 
humor. Whether he is discussing any of 
a number of sexual encounters, or 
Puckett's second wife's lung cancer 
(referred to as 'the Big C.'), the author 
lets no scene pass without evoking 
laughter from his reader. Those who 
bear the largest brunt of Jenkins' satire 
are the men of 'big bidness', the oil 
multi-millionairs whose greed and rac-
ism results in misunderstanding and 
exploiting the atheletes they own. 

However, the atheletes themselves 
receive little less of the author's 
good-natured derogation. Fortunately. 
Jenkins is not above satirizing his own 
chauvinism, his own mindless Jove for 
man-on-man competition, and his lust 
for the good life. In a sense, the author 
enjoys the best of both worlds; as in 
Semi-Tough. the hero lifts himself above 
>the people around him, comes our the 
unquestioned victor and reaps more than 
his share of the spoils. 

Dead Solid Perfect, and Semi-Tough 
before it, arrive at an opportune time. 
The literary spons enthusiast soon tires 
of the spate of sports essays which 
gn1ced the newsstands in the late sixties 
and early seventies on the hypocrisy and 
dehumanizing aspects of football and 
baseball. Books such as Gary Shaw's 
Meat on the Hoof, and Dave Meggsey's 
Out ofTheir League, poorly written by 
ex-atheletes, soon outstayed their wel-
come wtth thetr lack of humor and 
tendency to over emphasize their mes-
sage. Now, at a time when professional 
sports continues to enjoy the undivided 
attention of a growing public, but a 
public that demands more sophisticated 
writing, and a reaJistic perspective, Dan 
Jenkins' book will satisfy almost 
~ anyone. Obscene to the limits of good 
taste and sparing no one's sacred 
values, Dead Solid Perfect is an 
unquaJified success.


**Switch Bitch**
**Author: Bill Jacobs**

Switch Bitch is four taJes in the spare 
style that marks Dahl. The best of the 
stories rely on twisted plot and the 
twtsted character of Uncle Oswald, a 
" totaJiy unmoral man" who breeds 
spiders, collects Chinese porcelain and 
does his best not to waste his singular 
ability to hypnotize women with words. 
·'The Visitor" and .. Bitch" comes 
from his memoirs (28 vol.) beside 
which "Casanova's Memoirs read like a 
parish magazine.·' For Oswald and for 
Dahl sex is scientific object. Love-
making is surgery. Experiments are 
performed first with the oscillator then 
with the high-speed centrifuge. We are 
reminded that gin inflames the uterus 
and that cigarettes are an anti-aphro-
disiac. Dahl is less exciting and 
less artful than erotic writers like 
William Kotzwinkle. Only the first and 
the best tale in Switch Bitch is quite so 
creepy as fans of the Master of 
Nastiness may desire. Oswald, absent 
from the weaker middle stories, returns 
in the last (which must not be read 
before the first) where President 
Roosevelt is menaced by a perfume that 
sets back human sex habits half a 
million years. Hopefully Dahl remem-
bers his promise to publish at least one 
more episode from Uncle Oswald's 
journal.

**Power! How to Use It, How to Get It**
**Author: Robert Benjamin**

The crowded cubicles of Cross 
Campus Library and the swiftly-paced 
walk of so many Yale students are 
surely indicative of more than a pursuit 
of high grades or the release of 
anxieties. According to Michael Korda, 
the motivation for all of our sweat and 
our effort is linked with our search for 
power. Power! How to Use It, How to 
Ger lt, is a collection of common-sense 
observations that spring from one initial 
premise: "No matter who you are, the 
basic truth is that your interests are 
nobody else'!. concern, your gain is 
inevitably someone else's loss, your 
failure is someone else's victory ... 

To Korda, a New York publisher and 
the author of a work on the psychology 
of male chauvinism, power is at once 
the motivating force in a man·!. life and 
an amusing game of Machiavellian 
politics. It is one we play constantly and 
fiercely, one which affects our deaJings 
with those we command, serve and 
love. 

Korda's belief that power is a force in 
which few acknowledge and interest, 
yet all covet. In our society, sex is no 
longer the taboo subject of discussion, 
the world beyond is rarely taken 
seriously, the lust for "power-which is 
the ability to bring about our desires-is 
all we have left .... We believe in 
ambition as we one believed in 
salvation. 

The author relates various stories of 
celebrities (ostensibly those who have 
reached the goal of power), the games 
and exerciseswhich they mustplay and 
perform in order to remain among the 
swiftest, and the symbols of power 
which they so flaunt. 

Power! deals at length with the 
amportance, trappings and advantages of 
power in our lives, but it is doubtful 
that anyone who has this book will 
actually be any closer to that elusive 
goal. The type of clothes one wears, the 
set of hi!-. jaw. or the look in his eye are 
all crucial in the fame of competition of 
which Korda writes. Such information 
can provide a reader with choice items 
of trivia, but will not appreciably help 
the serious power-hunter. Indeed, it is 
difficult to read Power! with the proper 
respect that Korda would wish us to 
have. Tht!-. can be illustrated by a 
glance at the book·s chapter heading!>: 
.. Power Means Love:· .. Maybe I'm a 
Weakling.·· .. Gossip Power ..... Money 
and Sex are Force!-- Too Unruly For 
ReaMm.·· ··Foot Power.·· and ··A 
Gold-Plated Thermos is a Man's Best 
Friend.·· The contents of the chapters 
are generally as amusing and ridiculous 
as their titles. 

This is a book for those who scorn 
power rather than embrace it. Korda 
has, perhaps unintentionally, written a 
far more effective critique of society·s 
misdirected values than he has of how 
to win power and influence.

In Memory of Tim Horton, 
Defenseman for the Buffalo 
Sabres, Dead, at 40, in 
an Auto Wreck 
He went faster and faster 
but he couldn' t go any further in the 
enchantment of looking forward. 

He began to substitute 
remembering for seeing 
and people pretended to age. 
They stopped without any cause. 
Only he stayed young, 
living in a mean and childlike 
world playing 
games and having to argue. 
Perhaps he was supposed to die young 
but avoided death by acci~ent 
and lived in a world 
where nothing could change for him. 
a shadow followed him, 
a failure that started to stick. 
Life never became an effort, 
but he did begin to feel foolish. 
Inside the car he spun 
and hit the passive objects 
that would kill him. At first 
he hit them harder than 
they hit him. And then 
he kind of slept. 

The police found themselves 
talking to him. 
Even dead he seemed large 
and friendJy. But there was no more 
action green in his body. 
Things stopped moving easily 
around him. His coat seemed 
to cause discomfort. 

He had sought discussions 
but he reveived only 
this gnarled grace, caged 
in an agonizing vehicle.
