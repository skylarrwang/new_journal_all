What makes The New York Review so
different from any other magazine in
America? Why has it been called"... the
best general review of books and human
affairs to appear in this country in at least
a generation." (Henry David Aiken, Bran-
deis University)?
And why is the Review so often the
source of the new ideas that become the
center of discussion in literature, art, poli-
tics, science, history, psychology, educa-
tion?
Since it began publishing more than a
decade ago, The New York Review has
reshaped the standards and thinking of
American intellectual life. It has, for one
thing, redefined what good book reviews
should be-probing essays on the real is-
sues raised by the most important books
being published. As The New York Times
said, "it) has succeeded brilliantly...: be-
cause of its "stubborn refusal to treat
books, or the theatre and movies, for that
matter, as categories of entertainment to
be indulged in when the working day is
done."
Every two weeks The New York Review
of Books publishes criticism by writers and
scholars who are themselves a major force
in world literature and thought- Mary
McCarthy, Gore Vidal, Elizabeth Hard-
wick, Robert Coles, Garry Wills, Alfred
Kazin, Susan Sontag, H. R. Trevor-Roper,
Hannah Arendt, Robert Lowell, and many
others. They address themselves to a group
which represents something new and im-
portant in America: over 100,000 readers
who know that the wide range of subjects
will be discussed in an unusual way. "Read-
ing The New York Review," one professor
writes, "is my idea of what going to a bril-
liant, small university should be."
Is it any wonder that in this age of
screaming media- TV, radio, multi-million
copy magazines- The New York Review
with just over 100,000 circulation has be-
come the most discussed intellectual jour-
nal in the country? We believe that you,
too, will be fascinated by reviews and fea-
tures like these published in recent issues:

nial Address" that...America plain

In addition, Contributing Editor I. F.
Stone's articles-on Kissinger, on the CIA,
on the threat of an Oil War, on how Con-
gress was raped and the American people
conned in the Mayaguez affair-make The
Review even more essential reading for
those who care deeply about ideas and
political truth.
