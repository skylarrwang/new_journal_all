Helen Gettman is a blond stylish English woman in 
her early 40's. She is an OT VII and the executive 
director of the penthouse West End Avenue Mission. 
She started Scientology in 1966 though she had heard 
of it 4 years before but "wouldn't touch it because I 
had confused it with psychiatry.'' Previously she 
worked as a secretary, florist, and a poodle clipper. 
Her mother exckli~Md, • 'Oh no, not so~Mthing else!:' 
lJut now her mother is also a scientologtst. Geltman 
fondly kisses her three year old boy. explaining that 
she underwent special processing during her 
pregnancy, and that now motherhood contains no 
shouting or yelling, "/was much too severely 
aberrated to have a child previously." Marlcie is 
already a ~Mmber of the church, having given his 
consent at the age of 2 1/2. Nonverbal processing can 
include pets as well as toddlers, and Mrs. Geltman 
has processed her poodle. She considers Scientology 
as a way of life, but also as. her profession, " /don't 
work in Scientology to earn a living, Money is an 
energy flow but is not the important aspect. Some 
people spend 6 or 7 thousand doUars on a car, but 
what do they have? If they spent the same amount on 
themselves, they quadruple the worth. The song 
always goes through my head, 'On a Clear f!ay You 
Can See Forever,'" she contin~s. "Being clear is 
like standing on a mountain. There is nothing, no 
mass, around you. You feel causative and of use to 
others. Physically I'm in better shape, I upset my 
doctor with my perfect eyesight, and just had a 
wonderful experience with natural childbirth using no 
drugs.'' 


Mrs. Geltman' s husband is a millionaire who used 
to finance the Newport Jazz festivals. He also is OT 
VII and an intimate friend of Hubbard. She has never 
met Hubbard but corresponds twice a week. 
Darby Simpson is a striking young woman. She used 
to be a soap opera actress and stockbroker. Now she 
heads the New York Celebrity Center, the othu is in 
Los Angeles, having risen to the level of OT VII in a 
year and a half. 


A Celebrity Center is designed to process celebrities 
and professionals whose schedules are not accomo-
tklted by normal processing missions. They service 
such notables as Stan and Chick Corea, Karen Black, 
football player John Brodie, The Incredible String 
Band,andfour or five other top names whom the 
Church will not disclose as protection of privacy.

Miss Simpson, like many Scientologists interviewed' 
turned on to Scientology after reading Dianetics. She 
found that the book answered all her questions: • 'Why 
can't I expand? Why can't I have a successful 
relationship with a man? Why is there war? What is 
cancer? Why do I have a college education and end 
up r.s a typist? Why has God never helped?" 


As an OT VII, Miss Simpson has discovered the 
reasons the • • self' does not always operate at opti-
mum capacity, explaining that "Scientology only 
removes that which is suppressive to your 
own expansion, then there is no limit to what can be 
done. Acccmplish~Mnt is infinite. It differs from 
mysticism in having an actual technology." 


Tom Descher, for~Mr rock musician, current Cele-
brity Center official, commented that the levels had 
appealed to him, the fact that there was a step-by-step 
approach to Nirvana. "/ had goals," he continued, " I 
knew I was looking for freedom and ability, and I 
knew it was attainable but I didn't know how to get 
there from where I was. I was very skeptical about the 
whole thing, then the counselor told me I didn't have 
to believe any of it. That's what sold 1M.'' 


Luis Sroybnik, successful president of two flourish-
ing chemical firms, could have retired wealthy at age 
fifty. After half a century he wanted to examine his 
goals and decide on the next step. Excited by the pre-
liminary courses, he applied for Flag, the program on 
Hubbard's yacht, took a mini-student course, and as a 
result, decided he didn't want to retire and would in-
stead devote the principles of Scientological organiza-
tion to running his firm. He hasn't quite yet instituted 
an Org board, but now he ·'picks people for their 
enthusiasm.·· 


" I felt fulfilled and physically able before 
Scientology, but I just felt like doing more. I wasn't 
frustrated but/ didn't know what else to do. Now, I 
keep on wondering how much better can I feel?'' 


Joyce Gaines is a grade 0 class I auditor as well as 
working at the Guardian's offlCe. She used to be a 
chemical engineering major at Villanova. By her 
senior year, her life had dissolved. "/felt totally lost. 
my body was destroyed by four years of drugs, I was 
miserable, unhappy.'· A friend turned her on to the 
Dianetics and now it is her life. She is a mother and 
holds a position of tremendous responsibility within the 
organization. "I feel/ can crMte the type of life I 
want, I've got self-confidence and trust." 


Darby Simpson concludes. ' 'Scientology is not for 
everybody. We are not interested in the lower 
echelons. Dianetics is a present to those who areal-
ready making it and want to know if there is some-
thing else going on. It's to make the able more able," 
she cast a quick glance. • 'Able doesn't ~Man more suc-
cessful. Look it up in the dictionary, able means want-
ing to handle problems. Success, well, success is 
defined by th~ standards of society ... ••

Dianetics disclosed. The cost-$1,500.00." 


There is much that is awe-inspiring about 
Scientology: the enormity of its corporate structure, 
the breadth of disciplines explored, the minuteness of 
detail in explaining every conceivable physical or 
metaphysical phenomenon. Placebo or not, many of 
the dianetic techniques seem to have therapeutic value, 
not only to those helplessly flounderin~ but also to 
those happily functioning. Although ruhng echelons 
remain a mystery, on the franchised church level the 
administration is dedicated, sincere and ethical. No 
Nancy Harris is a sophmore in Davenport College and 
her favorite record is not ·'Stairway to Heaven.·· 
matter now fascinating, however, Scientology still 
reads like good science fiction. This is a case of a 
constructive system evolved from some very bizarre 
precepts in the guise of a scientific, technological 
approach to cosmic truth.
