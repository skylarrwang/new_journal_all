management-level employees out of a 
total work force of under 200. Arnold 
points out that these 30 are necessary 
for a store the Co-op's size, though the 
same number would also be able 
to manage a substantially larger store. 
Some note that several managers spend 
their time domg work that floor 
personnel could do, even though their 
salaries range from two to five times 
that of most floor personnel. 

The roles the Co-op management, 
Board, and university administration 
played in the ~nion pre-election can-
paign are difficult to establish for sure. 
A few facts are available. The law 
firm that the Co-op used to deal with 
the union is Yale's law firm. The Co-op 
union suggested this as one piece of 
evidence of th¢ University's involve-
ment in management's effort to prevent 
formation of the union. A board 
member noted that there are only two 
law firms in New Haven big enough to 
handle the Co-op's needs. The Co-op 
happens to use the same on Yale uses, 
he continued, as does the local utility 
company. 

Peter Halsey, assistent to the Univer-
sity Secretary Henry Chauncy, denies 
official university administration in-
volvment in Co-op affairs. He admits, 
however, that university offiCials who 
are on the board might use their offices 
to help the Co-op in incidental ways. 
Georgia Nelson, dean of Yale College 
and a Co-op board member, did obtain 
some anti-union literature that the 
university had used when the Yale 
Non-Faculty Action Committee 
(YNFAC) tried to form a union in 1971. 
She insists, however, that anyone could 
have obtained that literature and that the 
board subsequently decided not to use 
most of it anyway. 

The Yale administrator most per-
sistently mentioned by union members 
as having had a significant role in trying 
to prevent the formation of the union is 
Leonard Marcus, director of the Univer-
sity's employee relations department. 
This is significant. Marcus is the 
University's expert on unions. Pro-union 
and anti-union people alike recognize 
his handling of the 1971 YNFAC 
campaign as so skillful that any role he 
might have played in the pre-election 
campaign at the Co-op would have 
greatly effected the election's outcome. 

How might Marcus have influenced 
events at the Co-op? In an earlier, 
unrelated union campaign, a group of 
non-faculty workers at the medical 
school came together to deal with one 
common grievance. They got a few 
concessions from the University, but felt 
they were being ignored. They decided 
to try forming a union to force the 
University to recognize them. The union 
was to comprise virtually all clerical and 
technical employees of the University. 
Yale sent its employees letters which 
encouraged fear of union dependability: 
.. The union may make promises, but is 
not obliged to keep them;·' fear of lost 
independence: " How does the majority 
view individual initiative;" and fear of 
not being rewarded for achievements: 
.. Would you prefer to be promoted on 
the basis of your ability or your 
seniority?" These questions came from 
~arcu s's booklet. Besides writing the 
booklet, Marcus orchestrated the Uni-
versity's campaign. The union ended up 
receiving less than one third of the 1916 
votes cast. 

Marcus denies helping the Co-op in 
any direct way. Several board members 
denied having dealt with Marcus, as did 
Willoughby, although he said that he 
and Marcus are friends. Willoughby, 
Assistant Dean Nelson, and the Union 
all have copies of Marcus· booklet. 

The Co-op board's and management's 
pre-election campaign was less polemic 
than Yale's 1971 campaign. Yale sent 
its employees twelve opinionated letters 
while the Co-op sent its employees only 
three, which encouraged employees to 
vote and explained the reasons the board 
had refused to accept the union's 
eligibility on the basis of a union card 
check. In fact, in one letter, the board 
stated, " The board cannot be regarded 
as having taken any position [with 
respect to the formation of the unionj. ·· 
The board provided departmental 
meetings to encourage employees to ask 
questions about the union, but stopped 
having them after the first two resulted 
in distracting the workers from their 
work, because of the emotional issues 
The New Journal/October 2, 1975 
raised during those meetings, explained 
board member Nelson. 

Some union members think that the 
university administration, the board, and 
the Co-op management all opposed 
formation of the Co-op umon. Possible 
motives for their opposition do suggest 
themselves. 

The administration may have feared 
that successful unionization by Co-op 
workers would encourage Yale non-
faculty workers to try again. And 
indeed, non-faculty workers are doing 
just that. 

The board may have feared that 
rising labor costs and a strong union 
might disrupt the store's operation (as it 
would have had the strike been called) 
and make the store lose money which it 
hasn't done yet. 


The management may have believed 
that its interests and authority were 
threatened by the existence of a union. 
Some managers might have sensed a 
potential employment threat: afraid that 
as union member wages go up, the store 
will look for ways to economize and 
managers will be laid off. 

All the same, the documentation and 
most verbal evidence available suggest 
that if these groups had such motives, 
they did not act. The workers have 
acted ... Workers have the choice, .. said 
a union representative, ·'of acting or 
being squashed."

for the union, with 132 out of 136 
eligible voting, 70 voted for the union, 
62 against. Lou Pellgrino later described 
the moment: "After we all voted by 
secret ballot, the NLRB agent started to 
count the votes. The intensitv of the 
moment could be felt and was expressed 
on the faces of alI who were present. 
Management and their lawyer on one 
side of the room, the union reps and 
employees on the other side. As the 
vote tally was finally separated into two 
piles, we were one vote short of a 
majority, because of seven challenged 
ballots. Management walked out with 
tears in their eyes, and we walked out a 
bit confused. Within an hour, though, it 
all. came clear: we would win. The only 
question was wh:!n?" 

On 12 March, 1975. the management 
filed charges of unfair labor practice 
with the NLRB. It viewed the elections 
as unfair for several reasons, including 
the exclusion of an anti-union worker 
from meetings, and the preserJCe on the 
Board of a union employee. Union 
representatives replied that the board 
member had resigned his post in the 
union upon joining the Board, and that 
the employee had not been barred from 
meetings, and in fact had been allowed 
to speak at length.

Yale Religious Ministry, rejected them

grievance procedure that involves the 
election of five shop stewards who will 
meet weekly with representatives of 
management in order to work out 
problems with general working con-
ditions. Also, from now on store 
policies for check cashing, refunds, etc. 
will be written down and employees 
v 
will be clearly and correctly informed of 
them. Jury duty and overtime will be 
paid, and a health plan will be 
mtroduced. 

On the whole, employees are satisfied 
with these results. " It is really going to 
change the face of the Co-op." says Jan 
Wieben. They feel that the new 
agreement will have a beneficial effect 
on the store's operation in a general 
sense. Wieben says that " having a 
union at the Yale Co-op will improve 
service, improve the business, it will 
make them organize it better." 

Union members are also pleased at 
the effect of the union on their personal 
relations. Susan Wong says " Now 
we're much better at working together" 
and Wieben adds that "in that sense a 
union is a humanizing influence. " They 
are also optimistic about the future of 
the union. Helen Migliore shares this 
optimism and sees the main priority for
