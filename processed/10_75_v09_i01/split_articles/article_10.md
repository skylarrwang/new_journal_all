Elizabeth Taylor Grows Up 
There are worse ways. to spend six 
hours on a Greyhound bus, but I 
honestly can't recommend that you run 
out right now and buy £Iizabeth 
before the bookstores close. For $1 . 95 
it's a pretty good buy- 32 pages of 
photographs, and a hefty 607 pages of 
biographicaJ information including a 
detailed appendix of all her films and a 
one 
~c holarly 14 page index so you can 
look up your favorite parts. 


In fact Elizabeth is satisfying 
escapist readtng. While the mov1e fan 
magazine subject matter is on the trashy 
side, it's well written enough to be a 
guiltless experience. We are assembled 
here to learn the Truth about Elizabeth 
Taylor, though one is tempted to say 
this glowing account of the life and 
career of 'Mother Courage' perhaps 
omits details contrary to the thesis. 


lt's difficult to imagine what Shep..._ 
pard left out, since there's a wealth of 
trivia on every page. Everyone is named 
and identified, for instance the actresses 
who stood in for her in nude scenes and 
her current pets and their names. The 
author also pays careful attention to 
numerological details. You find out how 
much everything cost; her jewelry 
collection and charitable contributions 
are treated in detail, as is the budget for 
Cleopatra, just to prove once and for all 
• • I I • • I I I • • I I I I I I • • I I I I I 
that that disaster was not Ms. Taylor's 
fault. 


You think she's had a cushy life'? 
You think you've got problems? 
Elizabeth Taylor should just have your 
problems. So maybe no one ever applie!> 
superlatives like 'most beautiful woman 
in the world' to me. At least they don't 
call me " the only known survivor of a 
particularly virulent strain of staphylo-
coccus pneumonia.'' And if my boy-
friend's in Baltimore, well, romances 
survive ~rse obstacles. For instance, 
while CleojJatra was plunging 20th 
Century Fox millions of dollars into 
debt, Elizabeth fell deeply in love with 
Richard Burton, and their scandalous 
affair was "the greatest single news 
event of 1962 throughout the world,·· 
denounced by the Vatican and several 
U.S. congressmen. Now, how would 
you like that? Well, the Burtons are jus1 
folks like you and me. and they jusl 
wanted to be left alone to enjoy the 
same kinds of things we do-'Just 
pottering around, going for a walk 
together, taking the dogs out. ' " 


It's easy to read this book for laughs, 
since the author's passion for minu1ia 
has led him to include some absurd 
homey anecdotes. For instance, on page 
528, you can read about how they 
occasionally "go out to a local pub for 
a meal, and during the evening might 
tap each other lightly under the table to 
the opening bars of Beethoven's Fifth 
Symphony" (da-da-da-DA). 


The careful records of names, 
numbers, and aU phases of Elizabeth's 
behavior have a curious air of scientific 
authority. What do these facts add up 
to? Well, I'll tell you, Elizabeth Taylor 
may be the most beautiful woman in the 
world and the most relentlessly publi-
cized personality in show business, bul 
she's also a very nice person.

The trouble with a media pheno-
menon that stays big more than a month 
is that you begin to yearn for the time 
when it will become nostalgic. Were 
everybody's Brando-Godfather imita-
tions that funny? Whether you liked it 
or not (and you are really running out 
of excuses not to have seen it by now), . 
JAWS was big news this summer. The 
resulting national shark fever isn't 
nearly as endearing a fad as Beatle-
mania or Davy Crockett coonskin-caps. 
But that goddamn shark don't know 
zippo-scratch about going away. 


The first clue to the madness wa!> 
Time's cover story (6/23), billed as 
• • ·JAWS' On Film and Other Summer 
Thrillers." "Other Summer Thrillers" 
turned out to be a small box at the 
bottom of a page as if Time forgot about 
'em too. You could attribute this article 
to a "slow news week," but when the 
film opened a few days later the media 
went berserk with the biggest binge of 
free publicity since V-J Day. Broadcasts 
swam with reports on JAWS reactions, 
impact interviews, effect on the beach 
population in or out of the water, 
merchandisers with "clever" tie-ins, 
and National History Museums. Robert 
Shaw did his best to dump on the movie 
a few days before it came out, on The 
Tonight Show. He was tired and drunk, 
and John Davidson, the guest host, is 
such a jerk that I can't blame Shaw for 
that disaster. Seaside resort merchants could 
not make up their minds whether JAWS 
was helping or hurting business, and 
Martha's Vineyard natives don't like 
Americans anyway. The film's ad logo 
turned out to be a natural for political 
cartoonists, so much so that Universal 
ran a Sunday TirMs ad composed of 
some of the better ones. 


Everybody tried to cash in. Suddenly, 
T .V. nature shows like Wild Kingdom 
and LorM Greene's Last of the Dogfood 
sprouted sharks lurking in their promo-
ttonal ttlm and title credits. Tile New 
York Aquarium and other museums 
advertised special hours and lec~ures to 
see you-know-who. True Facts shark 
books ran ads looking for business the 
way chess sets had during the Fischer-
Spassky match. Philippe Cousteau, (son 
of Jacques), guested the Tonight Show 
pooh-poohing the film's naturalist value, 
but plainly sounding just jealous. 


Predictably, Universal unleashed the 
soundtrack album, the cocktail napkins, 
etc .• and two books on the making of 
the film appeared. (Except for screen-
wnter Carl Gottlieb's overbearing pres-
e n(;e, his JAWS Log isn't bad for that 
kind of book). For the real inside s1ory. 
1alk to Andy Russem, a Senior in J. E. 
who was there at the filming, and was 
in a crowd scene or two, though none 
of his friends can find him. 


A lot of this media-mania watching 
can be fun, getting into the philosophy 
of which national nerves the movie has 
touched, and why. But when you open 
a closet or the refrigerator door and thai 
huge reptilian paw lunges at you, it's 
time to get some sleep. 


So you tum out the light, but the 
sheets feel like two slices of bread, and 
you're in the mustard, when that damn 
thumping theme music starts up again, 
and the French hom beckons, and it's 
ou1 there, waiting for you.

OC(;Upied by an article focusing on 
recent discoveries of sharks in the Great 
Salt Lake, and other parts of Kansas.
