The size of the board was reduced from 
thirty to fifteen. For the first time, 
students were permitted to become 
members of the executive committee 
where most of the Board's decisions are 
made. 


Current board members admit that 
after the onset of economic difficulties, 
some board members wanted to dismiss 
Willoughby. They noted that while the 
store's sales had increased six-fold since 
his appointment, the dollar value of the 
patronage refund remained the same or 
even decreased. Also, Willoughby did 
not have a reputation for mixing well 
with his employees. 


That does not seem to have changed. 
Most employees whom we talked to 
said that they hadn"t seen Willoughby 
for a few months. His office is topo-
graphically the highest in the Co-op, 
located on the top of a two floor 
stairway, giving some the impression 
that he wants to place himself as far as 
possible from the general flow of the 
store's employees. 


However, some of the economic 
problems of the Co-op are outside the 
Co-op's control. One is the general 
economic condition of the country. 
Another is that since the "Fairness in 
Lending .. law, the store may no longer 
give different patronage refund rates for 
people who charge their puiChases and 
for those who pay cash. This has led to• 
a much larger use of charge cards, 
which, besides generating far more 
paper work, has forced the Co-op to 
finance its customers during the weeks 
before being paid, without compensa-
tion. Third, the Co-op counted on two 
new colleges to support its expanded 
facilities but these never materialized. 


· Interestingly, the Co-Op makes money 
on items that it sells as a department 
store, and loses money in services to 
members. For example, in 1973-74, the 
Co-op lost $100,000 on books, $40,000 
on records, stationary, room fittings and 
related items and earned $209,000 on 
the store's top floor where it sells 
clothes, sports equipment, umbrellas 
and the like. Members generally buy 
books, records, stationary and so on, 
not top floor items. These figures 
suggest that the store is run for its 
members and supported by outsiders, 
who receive no patronage refund for the 
60% of sales that they generate. 


Course books are the Co-op's biggest 
money losers. Since pre-registration is 
no longer required, the Co-op orders 
books by professor·s estimates. They 
tend to overorder and the Co-op must 
then return surplus books. 


In 1973, for example, the Co-op 
purchased $900,000 worth of books 
before the fall semester and subsequent-
ly found a $300,000 surplus. On those 
books, the Co-op had to pay the freight 
both ways and, in some cases, to pay 
the publishers for the privilege of 
returning the books. 


The issue which most antagonized 
some members of the board to 
Willoughby was the Co-op's expansion. 
They didn't believe the projections he 
made justified the move and until now 
they have been right. Although Co-op 
East generates slightly more than half of 
<he store's sales, its contribution to the 
store's profits is minimal. Moreover, the 
expansion into Co-op East costs the 
Tit~ N~w JOfUifQ//October 2, 1975 
Co-op between 9. 75% and 13% annual-
ly in interest charges on the $200,000 
loan which financed the expansion. 


Although no one seems to have made 
an issue of it, some current bOard 
members note that t:1e Co-op has more 
supervisory people than it needs. 
Wellsley Arnold, the Co-op's controller, 
affirms that there are approximately 30

thetic or afraid. "It is a difficult task to 
convince people that conditions they are 
used to after many years aren't any 
good for them," wrote Lou Pellegrino, 
now treasurer of the union local, in a 
workers' newsletter. Many workers and 
the union organizers soon sensed 
hostility towards the union on the part 
of supervisors and management. "They 
had these people scattered around," 
remembers one Co-op workers, "and if 
you were caught talking to anybody in 
~e union they would make their 
presence known. They literally threw 
people out." Wong recals the anti-union 
caveats of some supervisors, "You"Jl 
loose all your pension money, they'll 
make you go on strike, they'll tell you 
what to do.'' 


Nevertheless, by January 3, 1975, a 
majority of Co-op employees, excluding 
security guards, main office workers 
and supervisors, signed cards stating 
that they wished to be represented by 
the ACW A as their bargaining agent. 
The ACW A then asked the Co-op 
Corporation to recognize its status by 
OleaOS of a card check through an 
impartial third party. The Co-op 
refused, judging that it did not "believe 
that a majority of our employees would 
wish ~our union to represent them. ·' 


Many Board members felt that an 
election by secret ballot would be the 
most equitable way to decide the issue. 
Union leaders later judged that ''a 
card-check recognition would have 
avoided the division, bitterness, dis-
ruption and delay of a typical manage-
ment anti-union campaign." 


Following this refusal, the ACWA 
petitioned the National Labor Relations 
Board, (NLRB) for a representative 
election, while the two parties agreed on 
the 6th of March as the election date. 
Workers, union supporters and members 
of the Yale support group, during the 
period prior to the elections, held 
management responsible for a deliberate 
anti-union campaign. "We had 'captiv!! 
audience' meetings where the anti-union 
people would come to the fore and fire 
questions at us,·· one worker said. 


Another referred to anti-union propa-
ganda passed out and displayed on 
bulletin boards at the Co-op: "It was 
three pages of misleading questions like, 
'Would you lose your personal 
freedom?" ' A third recalls, "People 
were told various things. One woman 
was told she surely would be fired if 
she joined the union. We never 
brought any cases, but we had a Jot of 
small instances that together made it 
like ... we weren't proceeding completely 
freely. ·· This view was supported by the 
students in the YCSCW who observed 
conditions at the Co-op and wrote: "'We 
have found that discussions among 
workers have come to be conducted in a 
climate of fear. Employees have been 
denied rightful benefits once manage-
ment suspected their union sympathies. 
Some have been followed to lunch, 
others have had their conversations 
eavesdropped, their jobs threatened. 
Meanwhile, management has never 
informed employees of their legal right 
to a union.·· 


Many workers believed that these 
tactics were determined by guidelines 
presented to the board by the head of 
the Corporate Relations Committee, 
Georgia Nelson, in the presence of 
members of the YCSCW. 


Robert Sarason, member of the 
group, explained that the guidelines, 
which closely resembled those of an 
earlier campaign to oppose the unioniza-
tion of Yale University employees, were 
basicaJJy a list of do's and don'ts in 
dealing with unions, and specified 
actions such as the "captive audience .. 
meetings complained of by some Co-op 
workers. Sarason went on to say that 
Georgia Nelson had "informed the 
board while the YCSCW was there that 
she had conferred with Leonard Marcus 
(Director of Employee Relations at 
Yale). When asked about this at the 
meeting she said that it was purely an 
advisory role and Leonard Marcus had 
no direct involvement. '' 


This brings up the question of the ties 
between the management of the Yale 
Co-op and Yale University, specifically 
in terms of the alleged anti-union drive. 
Sarason told us that Larry Magar.ik, the 
union organizer, said that a closed 
meeting between Marcus and Willough-
by had taken place, but stressed there is 
no proof of any formal or official 
connection between the University and 
the Co-op. Rather, he, along with the 
Co-op workers we talked with, empha-
sises the unofficial, informal links 
between the two: "Five members of the 
university administration, top, heavy 
administrative types, including the 
budget director, are on the Co-op 
Board. Also, in the bylaws of the Yale 
Co-op, it ways that if the Co-op goes 
out of business, its money will go to the 
university. We found it very interesting 
that Yale University was going to be the 
recipient and not the members or some 
other charitable organization." 


It is largely because of this link, 
official or no, between the Yale Co-op 
and the Yale community, that the action 
of Yale students in the YCSCW and the 
Yale religious ministry had an effect. 
The campus ministry issued a statement 
during the election campaign supporting 
the workers· right to a union. The 
student group initiated a number of 
actions during this period, which 
included a picket of a Board meeting on 
the 4th of February. and an appeal to 
the board to insure that the workers 
would not be intimidated. 


The election was eventually a victory
