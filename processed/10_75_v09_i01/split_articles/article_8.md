out to play. According to Hubbard's teachings, "If 
ever there were a devil, he designed the reactive mind, 
the single source of all neuroses, psychoses, insanities, 
war and psychosomatic illnesses.·· When our 
analytical minds are on the blink, the reactive mind, a 
moronic tape recorder of each perception connected 
with the traumatic event, becomes a storehouse of 
·'pain and painful emotion·· that is resubmerged when 
consciousness is regained. These recordings are 
termed, in the Scientological argot, as engrams: the 
permanent trace left by a stimulus on the protoplasm. 
It remains in our reactive bank as recorded pictures 
just below our awareness. 

The following is a typical example, taken from 
Dianetics, of how the engram affects our lives: 
Therapy begins as the aberree holds a pair of tin 
cans attached to an E-meter. The auditor, a trained 
professional, asks the aberree a set of standard 
prescribed questions. The E-meter measures changes in 
electrical skin ·resistance, much like a simple lie 
detector. Scientologists describe the meter as a 
"space-age confessional aid, a sensitive electronic 
instrument designed to reflect, mirror-like, the Spirit's 
-hidden tensional wounds and encumbrances.'' Accor-
ding to Dianetic theory, mental thought -has electrical 
charge. Release of painful experience discharges 
jagged bolts of electricity, causing the E-meter needle 
to twitch violently. Areas of painful emotion, literally, 
"emotionally charged," are detected quickly by the 
E-meter, and the needle will float free in easy strokes 
when the engram has finally been released. Release of 
an engram has been described by scientologists as a 
sensation of vast relief, often accompanied by 
uncontrollable laughter. 

A woman is knocked down by a blow, 
rendered unconscious. She.is kicked and 
told she is a faker, that she is no good, that 
she is always changing her mind. A chair is 
overturned ... a faucet is running in the 
kitchen... 

The religion of Scientology expands dianetic 
principles to deal with man as a "being· ' or spiritual 
agent, whose optimum expression is infinite creativity, 
ability and awareness. This realized being is called a 
" thetan, · · who, at the highest possible disclosed level 
has transcended not only his matter, energy, 
space-time body, but has full control of this life and 
all previous ones as well. He has unlimited capacity 
for accomplishment now that the theta blocking_ 
limitations have been removed. 

Hubbard claims he fell into the intriguing notion of 
past lives accidently, through extensive empirical 
experimentation. During dianetic counselling he 
noticed that recollections of birth and pre-natal 
engrams did not produce relief in some patients. A 
man's throat pain persisted. In exasperation, Hubbard 
asked, " Well, do you remember something earlier? .. 
The man screamed "Yes! yes! .. He described a throat 
attack by a tiger in the year 8 B.C. Scientologists toy 
with the theory that maladies like arthritis may be 
compounded injury to one part of the body over many 
lifetimes. 

Even beginners have vivid past life recall. "The 
mind is composed of a series of uneraseable pictures, 
explains one woman, making a model with thumbtacks 
and paper clips (a dianetic technique towards 
understanding abstract concepts). "Past lives can be a 
very delicate subject. To be laughed at could cause an 
adverse effect.·· However, she wouldn't mind 
divulging her experience as an American Indian, 
because she "really dug it.·· She also remembers 
sliding out of the birth canal, and being blinded by 
lights. Another scientologist relates running into 
Napoleon, Christ and Moses in other lives. Hubbard 
pinpointed his person and place for every lifetime and 
then led an archeological expedition to uncover his 
then undiscovered Greek home towns. 

The engram would contain every possible perception 
occurring without her knowledge during unconscious 
ness. In the react1ve mmd: 
· 
the pain of the kick equals the pain of the 
blow equals the overturning chair equals 
the passing car equals the faucet... 

Later, this engram may be " keyed-in .. by any one or 
combination of the above actions, activating the 
engram and resulting in inexplicable pain or neurosis. 

In the case of this woman, while running the faucet 
she may hear a passing car, and will suddenly develop 
stomach pains and the sensation that she is no good. 

Even if a person has never been unconscious, 
knocked-out, blacked out, or under amnesia (sleep 
does not count), he may still have a rich bank 
of engrams. Do not forget the womb. According to 
Hubbard, it is a turbulent place. From the moment of 
conception, our cells are capable of recording 
engrams, even though the embryo hasn't the slightest 
approximation of a nervous system. Pre-natal engrams 
are easily acquired: " Mama sneezes, baby gets 
knocked ' unconscious.· Mama runs lightly into a table 
and baby gets its head shoved in. Mama has 
constipation and baby, in the anxious effort, gets 
squashed. Papa becomes passionate, and baby has the 
sensation of being put into a running washing machine. 
Mama gets hysterical, baby gets an engram. Papa hits 
Mama, baby gets an engram ... ·· 

In his dianetic examples, when Hubbard's women 
are not the frequent objects of beating, especially 
when pregnant, they are attempting abortions with 
kni!!in~ needl_es: . 
. 
It_ IS a scientific fa~t that ~rtion attem_pts are the 
most Important ~act?r m aberratl?n. The child on 
whom the abortton IS attempted IS condemned to hve 
with people ~e reactively knows to be_ murden:rs ... A 
large proport1on of allegedly feeble-mmded children 
are actually attempted a 
rt1on cases, w 
engrams 
placed them m fear, paralys1s or regress1ve 
palsy ... How many billions are spent on institutions for 
the insane and criminal because of attempted abortion 
done by some sex-blocked mother to whom children 
are a curse ... phys1olog1cal exam mat JOn o anyone w1th 
such a blockage w1ll demonstrate a phys1cal 
arrangement o t e gemta 1a or g 
s... 

Without realizing it, these engrams accumulate. 
They narrate our behavior, mind and body. Eyeglasses and the common 
cold are as much the mark of the aberree as violent 
schizophrenia. Any individual, however, may free 
themselves of engrams to become a "clear," enjoying 
greater health and higher I.Q. 

Labeled clay models are the Scientologist' s tool for 
conceptualizing abstractions and hurdling the ··bar· 
riers to learning.''

is self-monitored by a check sheet. People study in 
pairs to reinforce the concepts before the final test. 
100% is the only passing grade. 

Scientology requires assimilation of hundreds of 
pages of complicated philosophy and speciaJized jar-
gon. For maximum absorbtion, Hubbard devised 
techniques to overcome "barriers in learning.·· 

The first barrier is "lack of mass .. - a confusing 
abstraction of subject matter that brings on physical 
pain, pressure and t.eadache while studying. Students 
must work out aJl new concepts in clay, creating 
"mental pictures with 'mass.·· They are aJso aided by 
demo kits, collections of paper clips and erasers, to 
physically grapple with new concepts. The 
most emphasized study block IS the m1sunders.t00d 
word. This poses a very real danger in the daily life of 
Scientologists. Many of those interviewed occasionally 
referred to a dictionary during the course of normaJ 
conversation. 

Scientology claims to enhance any world religion. 
Ministers, who wear roman collars, dispense dianetic 
theory and therapy rather than ritual. What then, puts 
the church in the church of Scientology? Aside from 
its tax exempt status, granted by a United States 
district court in l972, acknowledging the cult ac; a 
religious institution, the church comes from the 
traditional meaning of the word religion as "wisdom.·· 
Scientology (scio: to know, logos; thought- the art of 
knowing how to know) is described as a 
"pan-denominational applied religious philosophy 
which contains a remarkable system of effective 
techniques ... ·· 

It· s hard to separate the rei igion from the organization. 
They feed on each other. Everything in Scientology 
has been explicitly diagrammed by Hubbard. The 
administrative strengths and financiaJ success of the 
missions hinges on what Scientologists refer to as the 
··org Board.·· The Guardian's office sports an Org 
Board easily the size of a door, compactly plastered 

The New Jownal/Ocrober 2, 1975 
with all the officiaJ titles of every staff position, from 
book packer to director. There are seven divisions, 
twenty-one departments, all spiraling stepwise up to 
source: L. Ron Hubbard. Many scientologists 
remarked that "if the New York City government had 
an Org Board there would be no more confusion.·· 

Spiritual growth is attain~d in two channels, one of 
which is the processing route, where the devotee 
actually takes courses in an academy and works 
toward clear. One can also train to become an a~ditor, 
a skill which is valuable to the church. Students can 
finance courses while under contract to the church. A 
certain number of work hours pays for their training. 
Breaking the contract incurs a $5000 penalty. Salarie!> 
are based on productivity and training experience to 
prevent "high officials soaking the underlings,·· says 
Joyce Gaines, Assistant Director of Public Relations at 
the New York Guardian·s office. 

Scientology aims to build a civilization without 
criminaJity, insanity or war. Decreasing the number of 
severely aberrated persons involves special programs 
oriented towards aJcohol and drug abusers. Narconon, 
a nationaJly instituted drug program for the purpose of 
prevention of drug abuse, related criminaJity and 
rehabilitation, uses dianetic communication techniques. 
They boast 85 percent success with prison graduates 
remaining trouble free, at least during parole period. 
Except for a defamatory report, written by the head of 
the California Department of HeaJth, the program has 
been recognized as socially beneficial by several towns 
in California and Louisiana, and Mayor Moon 
Landrieu of New Orleans declared a "Narconon 
Week" last January. 

The first Dynamic principle of existence is : 
SurvivaL And the church has managed fairly well to 
metamorphose any public threats to their survival into 
speciaJ investigation projects and Jaw suits. In recent 
years, Scientology has filed over one hundred libel 
suits here and in England against AMA, Fairchild 
Publications, Delacorte Press, Washington Post, 

The E-mDI!r is the crux of Diant!tic therapy. Operating liu a simp~ lie-detector, 
say the £-meter 
helps detect engrams, hidden mental recordings of pain, and aid in their physical release. Before auditing, those 
with serious physical illness must first consult a mLdical doctor, but headaches and colds have been known to 
disappear during an auditing session.

And just who is L. Ron Hubbard? He should be 
recognized as an undisputed expert on the art of 
bureaucracy and closed systems. Starting with 
Dianetics, he has published over five million words on 
the subject in over forty titles. This includes a 
577 page dictionary 9f specialized terms, as well as a 
$300 set, Organization Executive Course. World 
operations are handled from his 320 foot yacht, 
Apollo, in the middle of the Mediterranean. 

Even if half the stories about him were taJse, he 
would still remain one of the fascinating.characters of 
modem society. Born Lafayette Ronald Hubbard in 
Tilden Nebraska, 1911 his first claim to fame was his 
ability to ride horse-back before he could walk. He has 
some engineering background and holds a PhD from 
the now defunct Sequoia University in California. 
Twice Hubbard was pronounced dead, though he has 
apparently refused to believe it. Ouring World War II 
he served in the navy, and is allegedly the direct 
inspiration for the character Mister Roberts. He is 
also the first person to release mankind's "granddaddy 
engram,·· incurred by the human race .. many, many 
centuries ago, probably in the form of a supersonic 
shot in the forehead, chest and stomach, incapacitating 
and reducing the size and function of the pineal 
gland.·· 

Hubbard supports his multimillionaire status on 
royalties and family inheritance. He gets no money 
from the church, and in fact, loaned the Organization 
13 million dollars of his own. 10 percent of 
Scientology's intake goes to the mother church in 
England and the rest is held in a reserve account. 

His written output is prodigious. Besides the five 
million words on Scientology, (many written at 
lightening pace on a special typewriter with keys for 
small words) he has chumed out over 15 million 
words of science fiction, screenplays, fiction and 
westerns. He is a certified contributor to over 90 
national magazines under pennames: Rene Lafayette, 
Tom Esterbrook, El Ron, Captain B.A. Northrup, 
Winchester Remington Colt. 

He has also been an explorer, undertaking an 
Alaskan and Caribbean expedition under the flag of 
New York Explorers club, and a third expedition in 
1966 to study Mediterranean archeology. Before 
the age of twenty four, he worked as a radio crooner, 
newspaper reporter gold miner and movie director. He 
was a stunt pilot. ''Whenever two or three pilots are 
gathered together around," records an aviation 
magazine, " ... you'll probably hear the name of Ron 
Hubbard mentioned, accompanied by such adjectives 
as 'crazy,' 'wild' and 'dizzy.' The flaming haired pilot 
hit the city like a tornado a few years ago and made 
women scream, and strong men weep by his aerial 
antics. He just dared the ground to come up and get 
him." 

Hubbard claims to have begun definitive research 
into basic axioms of dianetics in 1938, though some 
believe it was actually in 1947, the time of his injury. 
He published Dianetics in 1950, and founded the 
church of Scientology in 1952. Another book was 
published at this time, though its release was withheld. 
According to the story in the July 1952 issue of 
Science Fiction Advertiser .. Hubbard related that he 
had been pronounced dead for ei~ht minutes after his 
navy inJury, and during that time, ''received a 
tremendous inspiration, a great Message" which he 
must impart to others ... He sat at his typewriter for six 
aays ana mgnls ana nommg carne out-then Excaliber 
emerged. Excaliber contains the basic metaphysical 
secrets of the universe. Dianetics is based on one 
chapter of Excaliber:• 

" Whe n four of the first fifteen people who read 
E.xcaliber went insane," says the Science Fiction 
Advertiser, " Mr. Hubbard withdrew it and place it in 
a vault where it remains until now. Copies are released 
only on sworn statement to not permit other readers to 
read it. It contains data not to be rele:~c:ed during._Mr.
