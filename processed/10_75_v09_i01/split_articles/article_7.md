ToU Road to Total Freedom 
by Nancy Harris 
1948-Pacific. A Japanese shell penetrates the hull 
of the Navy destroyer and explodes within four feet 
of Commander L. Ron Hubbard. He receives injuries 
for which he is officially pronounced dead over an 
eight minute period. Shell shocked, blind and 
paralyzed, he perfects the principles of what will 
become Scientology while miraculously effecting his 
own self-cure. 


1975-New Haven. A small suite above the Church 
St. MacDonalds. A pleasant smi lin~ ~irl iumos to 
offer the guest book. The wall behind her is papered 
with hand scrawled "Success Stories.·· On the facing 
walt, near hts portratt in a yachtmg cap, hangs 
correspondence from Hubbard himself. He sends his 
congratulations to the newborn New Haven mission 
and teases, " have you pulled in any Yale boys yet?" 


A world map bristles with pins designating the 40 
major churches and 200 missions. Six people sit facing 
a blackboard in a crowded cubicle and listen to the 
free introductory lecture. 


A bookseller aJ the N.Y. GJUJrdian's office peddles the most basic of forty odd volumes. 
Dianetics is the book thaJ most Scientologists claim revolutionized their lives. 


N. Y .C., Martinique Hotel. An air of commerciality 
drapes the bleak and bustling second floor home of the 
Guardian·s Office, the main nerve of the New 
York operation. Eager receptionists hover around 
newcomers. Their smiles fade with suspicion at the 
sight of cameras. There are no photographs, no 
interviews granted by a scientologist without the OK 
from the Guardian's Office. 


Scattered students of Scientology remain in the 
Academy during the lunch break, hunched in pairs 
over black consoles called E-meters. One clutches two 
tin cans, the other monitors the E-meter"s sweeping 
needle as his partner responds to questions about his 
headache. On long tables, little clay figures squat like 
bizarre Mayan idols, enigmaticaJiy labelled ''table,"· 
"chair, .. "reactive mind,·· " Man becoming free.·· 


Uptown, New York. A chicly dressed twenty-ish 
crowd with name tags tacked to Diors circulates at a 
Celebrity Center party. The electric bass and stamping 
feet from the band upstairs filter down to the thickly 
carpeted office of the director. This is one of the two 
Scientology centers designed for special treatment of 
the elite. Stunning, elegant and poised, the directress 
turns to us. "I tried psychology, group gropes, primal 
scream, TM, Yoga, mind control, the academic route, 
ancient philosophers, the Bible, Christianity and drugs. 
Scientology takes you further." 


Such is Scientology today. The posters have invaded 
New Haven. They won "t harangue you, like Sun 
Myung Moon·s disciples. Scientologists will tell you 
Scientology isn "t for everybody, only for those able 
to take the detailed path toward ful I personal 
realization and spiritual development-and who are 
willing to pay the $5,000 it costs to get there. 


Run as a tightly organized, self-perpetuating, 
lucrative bureaucracy, the group has sustained accu-
sations of racketeerism as well as quackery. Yet 
Scientology is expanding more rapidly than any other 
of the " modem" religions, claiming 10 million active 
members worldwide. And despite their reputation of 
hostile anti-press paranoia, most Scientologists inter-
viewed, especially those who had reached higher 
levels of spiritual training, seemed, if naively 
unquestioning, intelligent, alert, cheerful, and embar-
rassingly cooperative. They believe. 


In the church's rocky 25 year history, members of 
the group have been banned from England because, 
said British authorities, " The cult poses a potential 
menace to the well-being of its followers."· 


Scientologists have attempted to seek positions in 
Britain's NationaJ Association of Mental Health, have 
fought for ten years in U.S. courts against the t-ood 
and Drug Administration, and now continue to wage 
war against the AMA and psychiatric institutions, the 
CIA and Interpol, who condemn them as charljltans. 


To understand Scientology, one must be familiar 
with Dianetics-"discovered" in 1948 by Lafayette 
Ronald Hubbard. In his 400 page best-seller, 
Dianetics, The Modern Science of Mental H~alth , 
Hubbard outlines his "science of the mind,·· and 
claims "the hidden source of all psychosomatic ill and 
human aberration has been discovered and skills have 
been developed for their invariable cure.·· 


The basic principle of Dianetics is this: man is 
good. Our infinite potential, however, has been 
obscured by the accumulation of hidden injuries. Man 
has two minds, the analytical mind, a conscious center 
of awareness and identity; and the reactive mind, a 
repository of painful experiences. The analytical mind 
is an infallible computer which runs constantly, 
receiving and analyzing data, until the organism is 
knocked unconscious. Then the reactive mind comes
