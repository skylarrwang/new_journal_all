Heads Up
               POINTS OF DEPARTURE
Katharine Konietzko
Professor of psychology at Yale, 
designed the program in the early 
1960s. In 1963, a New Haven preschool 
opened as a laboratory for the program. 
Head Start later went national as part 
of Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty, 
under the aegis of the Department 
of Health and Human Services. Head 
Start’s holistic approach sets it apart 
from other early education programs: 
in addition to providing preschooling 
to three- and four-year-olds from low-
income backgrounds, the program 
also 
emphasizes 
health, 
nutrition, 
and parental involvement. Head Start 
provides training sessions for parents, 
for example, including courses in 
computer skills, résumé writing, and 
GED preparation. Keith Young, the 
agency’s male involvement coordinator 
in New Haven, works with fathers 
to encourage their engagement. The 
program has served over 22 million 
children across the nation. New Haven 
now has five Head Start sites, with 750 
children currently enrolled.
“Other programs only focus on 
getting the child ready for kindergarten,” 
Mannarino says. “Our philosophy is 
that if you strengthen the whole family 
and environment, outcomes for kids are 
better.”
The largest and most influential 
change since the program was declared at 
risk has been a complete reorganization 
of the staff to increase oversight and 
accountability. Before the audit, one 
Head Start director was responsible for 
all five sites in New Haven. Now, each 
school has a site director to oversee all 
the functions of the preschool. 
Montalvo is the site director at 
Helene Grant. “It’s much more of a 
community now,” she says. For two 
mornings, I watch her stand outside the 
building as children are dropped off. She 
greets every parent that walks through 
the double doors.
The 2009 review also found that 
children in the district weren’t getting 
dental health check-ups. It had proven 
nearly impossible, Mannarino explains, 
to make sure that hundreds of parents 
were taking their children to the dentist. 
The solution was simple and effective. A 
dentist came to the sites in a van loaded 
with equipment, and children received 
their dental exams at school.
The review additionally faulted the 
district for not engaging parents. “The 
Head Start program operated with little 
or no parental involvement in program 
decisions,” it stated. Since then, the 
program has established the Policy 
Council, a governing body comprised of 
elected parent representatives. According 
to Mannarino, the Policy Council must 
approve “basically everything” about the 
program, including matters of hiring and 
termination, transportation, and budget.
Two years after the review, reform 
efforts continue. This year the district 
introduced a new Scholastic Inc. 
curriculum. “We’ve been seeing results 
with it,” says Montalvo. Helene Grant 
School has also been the first site to 
introduce uniforms for students—
yellow polos with navy slacks and skirts. 
“Parents like it,” Montalvo explains, 
“because buying a few uniforms is less 
costly than buying lots of clothes.” 
The district passed its federal audit 
last year with flying colors. No deficiencies 
and no noncompliances were found.  
In Allison Peruso’s classroom, 
twenty children sit in a circle, quiet and 
cross-legged. “I thought it would be 
good for you to watch me write,” Mrs. 
Peruso says as she prints “Today is 
Tuesday” on the board in red marker.

After leading a chorus of the “Days of 
the Week” song, sung to the tune of 
“the Addams Family,” she points to the 
words she has written. Children raise 
their hands eagerly to answer. Many can 
read the letters on the board. 
If I didn’t know I was at the 
Helene Grant Head Start Center, a 
public preschool on Goffe Street, I 
would guess that this was a kindergarten 
classroom, and that the children sitting 
around the rug were not three and four 
years old, but five and six. A demanding 
curriculum is central to the Head Start 
program, particularly as the importance 
of early education increases in the public 
eye. “Times are changing,” says Myrna 
Montalvo, director of Helene Grant. 
“Thirty years ago, kids were not getting 
anything close to the level of preschool 
education we give today. With the pace 
of technology, kids now need to know 
more, earlier.” 
Recently, however, New Haven 
Head 
Start 
struggled 
to 
provide 
quality childcare. A 2009 investigation 
conducted by the federal Administration 
for Children and Families concluded that 
the program violated sixteen different 
regulations. 
The 
violations 
ranged 
from incomplete health screenings 
to inconsistent employee trainings to 
undistributed toothbrushes found on 
a shelf, still in their original wrappings. 
The program was labeled an “at-risk 
Head Start agency,” one of only twenty-
four cases to receive that categorization.  
Tina Mannarino, supervisor of New 
Haven Head Start, acknowledges these 
former deficiencies with grace. “When 
you think back on it,” she says of the 
investigation, “it really was very helpful. 
It gave us the clout to make some very 
big changes.” 
New Haven is the birthplace of 
Head Start. Edward Zigler, a Sterling 

When it comes to improvement, 
both Mannarino and Montalvo agree 
that the frequent reviews and audits 
conducted by federal agencies greatly 
help to keep the program in shape. 
“Even when you’re doing everything 
you’re supposed to do,” Mannarino says, 
“it’s good to have people come see you.” 
This is one reason why a recent 
policy decision by President Barack 
Obama troubles Mannarino. In an effort 
to maintain high accountability in the 
program, Obama has declared that the 
private sector preschools will be allowed 
to vie for funding with the bottom 25 
percent of Head Start sites. This aspect 
of Obama’s new plan is not, however, 
the part with which Mannarino takes 
issue. Instead, she is concerned that the 
top 75 percent of districts will not be 
reevaluated for five years. “Five years is 
a long time,” Mannarino says. Currently, 
the Administration for Children and 
Families reviews districts every three 
years. Audits and inspections by other 
agencies occur on different time cycles, 
ensuring that districts are kept on their 
toes at all times. The agency is due to 
review New Haven Head Start again 
next year. 
New Haven Head Start also 
conducts studies of its own, testing its 
four-year-olds three times a year. For 
example, New Haven Head Start offers 
both ten-hour days and six-hour days. 
The program’s studies indicated that 
their children at school for ten hours a 
day were not progressing as quickly as 
children who came for only six hours. 
“We’re taking that very seriously,” says 
Mannarino. “And we are considering 
getting rid of the ten-hour option if it is 
not needed or effective.” 
Not 
all 
changes 
have 
been 
universally popular. A teacher who has 
been in Head Start for over fifteen years 
says that some of the changes have 
imposed too much rigidity on both 
children and teachers. She cites “too 
much paperwork” and “not enough time 
and freedom to teach the children” as 
major problems. When asked where the 
burdensome restrictions come from, she 
gives me a knowing look. “They come 
from the same place where we get our 
money,” she says.
Though 
some 
might 
criticize 
excessive 
federal 
regulation, 
more 
criticize inadequate federal funding. “I 
would really like to see enough money 
for us to get all certified teachers,” says 
Mannarino. Of the five Head Start 
sites in New Haven, only at Helene 
Grant are all the teachers certified. 
“Having certified teachers makes a huge 
difference,” says Mannarino. “We never 
have gotten enough of an increase to 
support the change. We’ve been funded 
at the same level all these years, but 
health benefits and salaries keep going 
up. It’s difficult to maintain program 
quality with inflation.” In this recession, 
there are more children on the waiting 
list than ever before in district history. 
Still, the New Haven district’s many 
successes demonstrate that government 
agencies can indeed make themselves 
efficient 
and 
address 
their 
shortcomings. After talking to those 
involved in the agency, I’m tempted 
to say that its rigorous and self-critical 
approach is something that not only 
other Head Start districts but also the 
private sector might do well to emulate.
