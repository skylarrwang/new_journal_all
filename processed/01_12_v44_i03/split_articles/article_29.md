evidence in his case, but the sentence 
was reinstated in 2000. By that time, 
Ross had decided he was ready to die for 
his crimes, choosing to forgo any further 
appeals. The scrap that Hogenauer 
carried around like a relic was from an 
envelope that had once contained 
one of several letters Ross sent 
her while on death row. 
Ross’s 
letters, 
thanking 
Hogenauer for her support, 
were meant to reach her after his 
death, but, due to multiple stays 
of execution, Hogenauer and 
others received multiple letters, 
each seemingly coming from 
beyond the grave. The last one, 
from May 2005, was not a false 
alarm. That month, Ross became 
the first person to be executed 
in 
Connecticut 
since 
1960. 
Connecticut, 
which 
currently 
has ten people on death row, is 
similar to the few northeastern 
states that still have death penalty 
statutes on the books in that 
the death penalty is, in practice, 
almost never carried out. The exception 
was a man who chose to die instead of 
fighting indefinitely through the appeals 
process. Ross’s decision to die in order 
to spare his victims’ families the pain of 
further appeals was “well-intentioned,” 
Hogenauer said. “But it was a mistake.”


While Ross, Komisarjevsky, and 
Hayes all confessed to their 
crimes, a state that administers the death 
penalty runs the risk of executing people 
who have been wrongfully convicted. 
In 1989, James Tillman was convicted 
of sexual assault, robbery, kidnapping, 
assault, and larceny. He was not 
sentenced to death, but his convictions 
got him forty-five years, of which he 
served sixteen and a half before being 
exonerated and released in 2006. State 
Senator Edith Prague of Norwich 
cites the Tillman case as significant in 
changing her view of the death penalty. 
She had previously taken a stance 
during the trial of Ross, who murdered 
the granddaughter of one of Prague’s 
neighbors. This personal connection 
had made Prague a supporter of the 
death penalty for criminals like him, but 
James Tillman’s exoneration shook her 
belief. “I really began to think about 
my position on the death penalty and 
decided that the chance of somebody 
being innocent and facing execution 
for something they didn’t do was just 
too much for me to bear,” Prague said. 
“So I decided I would vote for repeal 
and for life in prison for somebody who 
commits a heinous crime.” 

Recently, opponents of the death 
penalty in Connecticut have come very 
close to winning repeal. In 2009, a 
repeal bill passed both houses of the 
state legislature, but Governor Jodi Rell, 
a Republican, vetoed it. This past year, 
with Dannel Malloy, a Democrat and 
an opponent of the death penalty, in 
the governor’s office, activists hoped to 
push another bill through the legislature. 
But in May, when abolishing the death 
penalty came up for a vote once again, 
Prague voted against repeal and for the 
death penalty. Steven Hayes had already 
been sentenced to death by this point, 
but Komisarjevsky still awaited trial. 
Like Tillman’s case, the Cheshire murder 
trials had given Prague another change 
of heart. Just before the death penalty 
repeal vote in the state senate, Petit 
requested to meet with Prague. 
“I don’t know what the families 
would feel about our death penalty,” 
Prague said. “It certainly is a long, drawn 
out process. It costs the state millions of 
dollars because of the appeals. But that 
wasn’t the issue for me. The issue for me 
was that the bill was something 
that Dr. Petit’s lawyer said that 
they wanted and needed in order 
to get the death penalty for these 
two...” she trailed off, pausing 
before referring to Hayes and 
Komisarjevsky. “I don’t know 
what you want to call them. I 
can’t find a word to describe how 
horrible they are, both of them.”

Prague was able to find 
words for Komisarjevsky last 
May, however. “I said they ought 
to hang him from his penis from 
a tree downtown,” she told me. 
Even though Komisarjevsky’s 
lawyer protested that this type of 
comment could potentially sway 
his client’s future jurors, Prague 
said that the reaction amongst 
her constituents was positive. “I 
had one man call and say he wanted to 
pick out the tree.” Prague and Maynard 
both voted against repeal, and the bill 
to abolish the death penalty failed once 
again. 

Could the movement to abolish the 
death penalty in Connecticut really have 
been halted by a single conversation? 
Does the understandable desire of one 
heartbroken man to seek his version of 
justice override the high costs—financial 
and otherwise—of capital punishment? 
Speaking to Prague, I remembered 
Victoria Coward, a representative of the 
Connecticut Network to Abolish the 
Death Penalty, or CNADP, and a New 
Haven mother whose son Tyler was 
murdered when he was 18. At a talk at 
Yale this fall, Coward didn’t focus on 
her search for justice through the legal 
system. Instead, she talked about the 
emotional toll her son’s death has taken 
on her family and about the lack of state 
resources to aid the families of murder 
victims. It is as if the state assumes that 
its penalties—including the sentencing 
of 
the 
murderer 
to 
death—can 
somehow bring victims’ families a sense 
of “closure” when, in reality, nothing 
can. Ben Jones, Executive Director of 
CNADP, takes issue with how death 
penalty law “holds up certain murders as 
being particularly heinous while ignoring 
the fact that all murders are heinous. It 
can be disrespectful to try and distinguish 
between murders and say that some are 
more heinous than others.” If Victoria 
Coward had gone to Hartford in May 
to plead with Prague to vote for repeal, 
at the same time as William Petit was 
asking her to vote against it, whose story 
would have proven more persuasive? 

Prague knows that in practice, 
does 
not 
perform 
executions, but she still thinks that 
both Hayes and Komisarjevsky—if he 
is sentenced to death—will eventually 
be executed for their crimes, pending 
changes in the way the death penalty 
works in Connecticut. “If the death 
penalty stays in place, I think we 
absolutely need to limit the amount and 
number of appeals,” she said. “I think 
there’s a lot of work that needs to go into 
the death penalty law that we have on the 
books.” A death sentence in Connecticut 
is not a one-way ticket to the execution 
chamber. Instead, it places an inmate in a 
limbo between life and death. It’s kind of 
like tossing someone into the middle of 
the ocean. As long as he can tread water 
throughout years of appeals, he can stay 
afloat. It’s not a great life, by any means, 
but for most on death row, it beats the 
alternative. Only if a prisoner chooses 
to stop treading—as Michael Ross did—
will he drown. Death penalty proponents 
would have a hard time arguing that the 
current system either deters crime or 
delivers justice to victims’ families. Of 
course, opponents of the death penalty 
argue that, even when it is carried out, 
capital punishment serves neither of 
these purposes.


On November 23, Oregon governor 
John 
Kitzhaber 
ordered 
a 
moratorium on the death penalty for the 
remainder of his term in office, joining 
politicians in Illinois, New Mexico, New 
Jersey, and New York who have abolished 
or altered death penalty laws in recent 
years. Only two men have been executed 
in Oregon since the death penalty was 
reinstated there in 1978; both, like Ross, 
had to request an end to appeals in order 
to receive their sentences. “The reality 
is that, in Oregon, our death sentence 
is essentially an extremely expensive life 
prison term,” Kitzhaber said, according 
to The Washington Post. The decision 
had a direct effect on an Oregon death 
row inmate named Gary Hauger, who 
had abandoned further attempts at 
appeal and was to die on December 6. 
Hauger is angry. His victims’ families are 
angry, understandably. But Kitzhaber’s 
reasoning is simple. “I simply cannot 
participate once again in something that 
I believe to be morally wrong,” he said. 
Whatever you believe about the 
inherent morality of capital punishment, 
think about its iteration in states like 
Connecticut, Oregon, and Pennsylvania 
(my home state), where it is up to the 
convicts to choose whether or not they 
die, where the death penalty serves as a 
hollow symbol of justice. Think about 
Victoria Coward, whose daughter has 
sunk into depression and substance 
abuse that no punishment of her 
brother’s killer could reverse. And while 
you are thinking, Joshua Komisarjevsky, 
who has yet to be sentenced as of press 
time, will be wondering if a hand will 
come down from above to scoop him 
out of the water. Whether or not the 
state legislature votes to abolish the 
death penalty during its next session, 
Komisarjevsky will spend the rest of 
his life locked in prison with a horrible 
burden on his soul. In the meantime, 
he’s begun his endless wait. The defense 
has rested its case.
