and Chiaraluce can’t step out of the 
system, people like King need to find a 
way to create hope inside of it.

Lee Cruz, who welcomed King into 
the neighborhood, has lived in Fair 
Haven for almost six years and worked 
here far longer than King. In his eyes, it’s 
a magical place. He took me on a tour 
of the neighborhood on a brilliantly 
sunny day in late October, beginning by 
the Quinnipiac River, three blocks east 
of Atwater Street. “Just look at this,” he 
said. The stone-and-clapboard houses 
that dotted the banks were painted in 
cheery pastels. Cruz told me they used 
to belong to ship captains and first mates 
when this was a thriving harbor town. 
The water was a surprisingly rich blue 
against the bright fall foliage, or, when 
the sun hit it, a dazzling pane of light. 
“It’s a little paradise,” Cruz said.


A few minutes into the tour, it was 
clear that Cruz knows everything about 
Fair Haven. He first got involved here 
over a decade ago, through his work with 
the Community Foundation for Greater 
New Haven, and now he says he’ll never 
move anywhere else. “I’m going to be 
taken out of this neighborhood boots 
first,” he joked. He can tell you Fair 
Haven’s role in every aspect of American 
history from the maritime economy to 
the Civil War. 


He recounts the neighborhood’s 
past as if it were a fairy tale. He told me 
that the British saw creatures swimming 
in the water when they sailed up the river 
in the 1600s, and, unable to recognize 
them, decided they were sea monsters. 
The animals turned out to be seals, but 
the town kept the name “Dragon” until 
1824.


Cruz isn’t an idealist. He grew up 
partly in New York City and partly in 
a low-income housing project, and he 
told me that too many of his friends 
from childhood are dead, in jail, or 
raising families in the same abject 
poverty into which they themselves 
were born. He knows how bad life in a 
bad neighborhood can be, but he’s seen 
enough positive change in Fair Haven to 
justify his optimism.


“In a neighborhood like this, it’s 
not that bad things don’t happen. It’s 
that the bad things that happen are not 
the center of the conversation or the 
center of the way the neighborhood 
thinks about itself,” he said. When he 
first moved to Fair Haven, he renamed 
a nine-block radius after the small park 
at its center, Chatham Square, and 
founded a neighborhood association to 
bring together the area’s residents and 
those of Fair Haven more generally. 
His own home on Clinton Street is part 
of the small Chatham Square district, 
and Atwater Street is one of its outer 
boundaries. 


The 
Chatham 
Square 
Neighborhood Association has been 
active since its founding. Once Cruz and 
others harassed a drug-dealing family on 
Atwater Street until they moved, and the 
association petitioned for speed bumps

and narrower lanes on the same street 
to discourage the prostitution and drug 
sales that relied on it for a fast getaway. 
They erected play sets in a park where 
dealers used to conduct their business, 
helping the neighborhood children 
paint a mural that reads “We Love Fair 
Haven” on its graffiti-covered walls. 
Today, they partner with the Yale School 
of Public Health to teach good eating 
habits in schools and put fresh fruit 
and vegetables in local stores, and they 
hold an annual Halloween festival and a 
neighborhood clean-up in the spring. 


But of all the group’s efforts, Cruz 
said none has been more important than 
coining the name “Chatham Square.” 
These blocks are no different than 
those around them—he relabeled them 
because “Fair Haven” had such negative 
connotations. 


“We 
rebranded 
the 
neighborhood,” he explained proudly, 
adding that both the mayor and Channel 
8 News had picked up the phrase within 
a year. Cruz couldn’t throw out the entire 
history of Fair Haven, but renaming his 
neighborhood gave him some small 
license to start over.


While King is animated, Cruz 
is reserved. He wears wire-rimmed 
glasses and a graying beard, and, on 
cold days, a tweed beret. His speech is 
soft and measured. But he is clearly at 
ease in Chatham Square, where he is 
a familiar sight because he walks the 
neighborhood twice a day with his dogs. 
On the morning of my tour, he greeted 
every person we passed, from a man 
clearing leaves in his yard to a teenager 
slouching by in a hoodie.  


Cruz told me his role, and that of 
the neighborhood association, is to 
provide a combination of “common 
courtesy and customer service”—not 
to preach or prophesy. “I have a vision 
for the way the world should be, and I 
haven’t given up on that vision,” he said. 
“But that isn’t the most important thing.” 
Addressing a hypothetical neighbor, 
Cruz said, “The most important thing is, 
‘What do you want to do?’ Because you 
want to work with me.” Cruz told me 
that affluent people who attempt to help 
impoverished neighborhoods sometimes 
fail because they get too wrapped up in 
their own ideas. Reading people is part 
of helping them, and vision can be 
distracting.


Though he tries to keep the big 
picture in mind, Cruz relishes the 
small successes. In this line of work, 
they may be the most important 
kind. During our walk, Cruz pointed 
out a house on Atwater covered in 
Halloween decorations over a week 
early. “This is what I live for,” he said. 
Someone had spent considerable time 
stringing cobwebs across the shrubs and 
transforming the lawn into a miniature 
graveyard, and their efforts brightened 
the entire street. 


Hope is as important to Cruz’s 
mission as it is to King’s, but the 
things that indicate its presence are 
unglamorous: a well-kept lawn, a big 
turnout at a movie screening, a mural

community for over a decade.


that is untouched by graffiti after over 
a year. These victories won’t free the 
neighborhood from urban America’s 
myriad, interlocking problems. But they 
make people feel better about the place 
where they live and inspire them to 
improve it, little by little.


Cruz isn’t trying to make this 
neighborhood anew. He already loves it 
here. He told me that he, like others who 
live in Fair Haven though they could 
afford a house somewhere else, does so 
because Fair Haven reflects reality more 
accurately than an affluent neighborhood 
could. “It’s in that diversity of color and 
ethnicity and income that we want our 
kids to grow up,” he said. “And our kids 
will see that that’s the way the world is. 
They’re not being sheltered behind a 
wall. We’ll do what we can to fight against 
it, but we’re not going to hide from it 
by moving someplace where it quote-
unquote ‘doesn’t exist.’ ” Perfection is 
always an oversimplification, and Cruz 
isn’t looking for that. He gave me an 
alternative vision of utopia—one that 
embraces this neighborhood in all its 
complexity.


Cruz is trying to get to know King 
and the other members of ARC, 
not because of the value of their 
ideas, but because he’s hopeful that a 
community could grow up around their 
efforts. He pointed me to research by 
Felton Earls, a criminology expert at 
the Harvard School of Public Health 
who demonstrated that when neighbors 
get to know one another, violent crime 
decreases. Communities where adults 
know the children by name fare the best. 
Adults have more sway over miscreants 
if they can threaten to call their parents, 
and those miscreants are less likely to 
hurt people they know. 


Fair Haven’s communities are 
usually affinity groups. Ecuadorians 
might help other Ecuadorians, Puerto 
Ricans might help other Puerto Ricans, 
and so on, Cruz said. (I thought of the 
Voigts and Chiaraluce, all of whom 
are white.) Earls’ theory only applies 
to communities formed around shared 
space, not shared interests. Cruz said 
the Chatham Square Neighborhood 
Association 
works 
to 
promote 
inclusiveness, and ARC could do the 
same. Many of ARC’s projects could 
bring together the people of Atwater 
Street, like the garden Waschall and King 
hope to start in a spacious backyard, or 
the day camp they might run for local 
children.


The best ways to build community, 
Cruz said, are simply to learn to 
compromise, and to stick around. When 
I told him my concerns about ARC, and 
those that the Voigts and Chiaraluce 
voiced, he wasn’t surprised. King, 
Waschall, and the others “will make 
mistakes,” he said. “They’ll get people 
that are naysayers on both sides”—
poor people who resent their ideas and 
affluent people who don’t understand 
their desire to work with the poor. But 
they have made an investment by moving 
in, and if they stay they will become 
part of the neighborhood and gain the 
credibility with which to change it.


The last time I talked to King, he 
was still more interested in world history 
than in community building, but he 
assured me that he sees his move to 
Atwater Street as a permanent one. 
He’s putting down roots here to prepare 
for a global cataclysm, but I hope that 
if it doesn’t come, he’ll continue, as he 
said, trying to “take care of our own 
backyard.” 


Waschall told me that his perspective, 
at least, has changed in his months on 
Atwater Street. “When we got here, it 
pretty quickly became apparent that we 
needed other people involved to make 
this work,” he said. Waschall is clean-cut 
with a young face, but he’s thoughtful. I 
have often seen him pause to consider an 
opinion. Though he more or less follows 
King’s lead, I suspect that he has his own 
ideas about how ARC should proceed. 
In our most recent conversation, he told 
me he is still committed to alternative 
currencies, but thinks ARC should be 
open to some cash transactions if that’s 
what their neighbors need. The currency 
system is the vehicle. The point of 
the project is “a great life, the people 
around you, abundance in relationships, 
happiness.”


Though utopia is out of style, despair 
isn’t the only option. Fredric 
Jameson, a famous utopian thinker and 
professor at Duke University, recently 
wrote that the modern era needs 
to counter nihilism with “anti-anti-
Utopianism.” We may never regain the 
hope that we can get it exactly right, but 
we can still work to improve the world 
we have.


To me, Cruz is the essential anti-
anti-utopian. He brings to his work 
not only the dogged belief that things 
will get better, but also the humility 
to compromise and the patience to 
keep trying, even when people reject 
his help, sabotage his spring clean-up, 
or vandalize his brand new park. King 
has the first trait, and I hope that, as he 
grows to love his new home, he may 
develop the other two. Regardless of his 
opinions about money, King has spent 
a lot of his capital on real estate in this 
neighborhood. Unlike me, he can’t get 
on a bicycle and go somewhere more 
comfortable at the end of the day. If 
Cruz is right about the importance of 
community, then it’s in King’s interests 
to foster one in Fair Haven. 


I suspect that King will have a hard 
time making Atwater Street conform to 
the vision in his mind, and I think that’s 
for the best. The problem with utopia 
is that it’s an end goal. Once you get 
there, you have nowhere else to go. It 
is the attempt that reveals the incredible 
power of the human imagination and 
the magical truth that changing the 
way people think about their lives 
also changes the way they live. I hope 
King, the cognitive scientist, will see a 
profound “consciousness shift” in this 
neighborhood. It may just take place less 
in his neighbors, and more in himself, 
than he expects.
