“Yes,” he responds, and looks 
disappointed with himself. He tells me 
he was caught while in the process of 
moving residences—the pornographic 
pictures he’d found online blew out 
onto the driveway. The movers found 
them and turned him in. It’s good that 
it happened, he says, because it made 
him stop looking at child pornography 
earlier than he would have otherwise. He 
has nine years of probation left to go. 
According to the registry, he’s the same 
height as Palmieri. I can’t see it under his 
red-and-white flannel shirt, but I know 
he has a three-inch scar on his right 
shoulder.


Using the addresses on the registry, 
I attempted to contact the five other 
offenders, besides Palmieri and Boppert, 
currently living in the Hotel Duncan. 
The hotel’s receptionist told me that 
one had moved out about a year ago, 
though the change had not been updated 
online. Another, the only one living at 
the hotel with a federal conviction, had 
been recently changed on the registry to 
“non-compliant”, meaning he had not 
checked in with probation for more than 
three months. He did not respond to 
my letter or calls. Three declined to be 
interviewed. 


The last sex offender, James Szelest, 
38, said at first that he would only talk 
to me on the record if I omitted the 
hotel’s name and address. If people read 
my article and found out there were sex 
offenders living there, customers might 
stop staying at the Duncan. If enough 
people were turned away, he explained, 
the hotel might go out of business.


This put me in a difficult position. 
On the one hand, Szelest’s address was 
public information, easily accessible with 
a few quick online searches, and I could 
not omit it from the article. But on the 
other hand, he had a good point—my 
article could deter potential clients, put 
the hotel out of business and send him, 
along with the others, to a homeless 
shelter.


The 
state’s 
probation 
system 
essentially forced the offenders to 
aggregate in one place. And not just 
any place, but a hotel on a busy street 
right next to an affluent university, sure 
to garner attention. In publicizing this 
information, the state registry, a tool 
meant to ensure community safety, 
could actually be responsible for putting 
them all on the street. The overall system 
seemed inherently faulty, dangerous and 
unfair, for the sex offenders and for the 
communities where they live.


Two years after Timmendequas 
raped and killed seven-year-old 
Megan Kanka, President Bill Clinton 
signed Megan’s Law, requiring each 
state to register sex offenders and to 
publish personal information about 
them. As long as these two basic national 
requirements are met, each state has 
authority over its own version of the 
registry. It is more recent legislation, 
passed in 2006, that requires registries 
to categorize offenders by the level of 
risk they pose, but Connecticut has 
postponed updating its registry for 
budgetary reasons.


It is a problem that Connecticut’s 
current registry does not provide much 
information that could help viewers 
understand the level of risk that individual 
offenders pose, said Mike Lawlor, a 
former state representative and now the 
state’s undersecretary for criminal justice 
and planning. On December 5, there 
were 564 sex offenders in 449 locations 
within five miles of my zip code, 435 
offenders in New Haven, and seven 
in the Hotel Duncan, according to the 
registry. It gives physical information, 
conviction and release dates, addresses, 
and the degree of sexual assault for each 
individual, but not, for example, whether 
the individual has assaulted males or 
females, adults or kids, strangers or 
acquaintances. 


The state has a system to determine 
whether sex offenders pose high, 
medium, or low risks of recidivism 
and harm to the community, but the 
information is used exclusively by 
probation and parole officers and is not 
even publicized on the registry, Lawlor 
said. He also, controversially, argues that 
some low-risk offenders should not be 
on the registry at all, including some who 
were convicted for statutory rape. 
“For example, a high school senior 
who takes a high school freshman to 
prom. The classic case where the parents 
call the police. O.K., that’s what the law 
says, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that 
the guy who had sexual relations with 
this girl is a high-risk pedophile,” he 
said. Ideally, the state would establish 
a board responsible for determining 
risk specifically for publication on the 
registry.


Most people perusing the registry 
in its current form will assume, as I 
did, that all of the sex offenders living 
in the Duncan pose a high risk to 
the community. Most people would 
probably be afraid of what might 
happen at the Duncan. Lawlor said if 
the state added risk categories notifying 
the public whether or not there are high-
risk sex offenders living in the hotel, this 
clarification would help assuage these 
fears. But I’m not sure that solution 
alone would solve some of the major 
problems with the system.


A few weeks after our first phone 
conversation, Szelest called me back and 
left a message apologizing for his earlier 
resistance to being interviewed. 
“It’s hard enough being published 
already,” he said, referring to the registry. 
Unlike Palmieri, who will only be on the 
registry for a total of ten years, a standard 
amount of time for sex offenders, Szelest 
said he will be on it for life, because of 
the court ruling on his case. 


He was worried about losing his 
home at the Duncan if I published 
the story, he said, but decided he 
wanted to “get his side out.” He was 
arrested for the possession of child 
pornography, according to the registry 
and corresponding court records. He 
said he turned himself in to the police 
after his wife found the photos on his 
computer.


Szelest said he “disgraced” his 
country by his actions. He is an Army 
veteran and has been threatened by his 
neighbors in the Duncan and by other 
veterans. Although an expanded registry 
would help the public determine the risk

offenders pose to those around them, 
Szelest added in a later interview, he 
is put at risk by the fact that his legal 
status is public. More information is not 
necessarily better for his safety.


Meanwhile, 
recent 
research 
questions whether the registries really 
increase community safety across the 
nation, said Randall Wallace, program 
director of the Center for Treatment of 
Problem Sexual Behavior at nonprofit 
The Connection. The organization 
oversees treatment for all offenders in 
the state of Connecticut and will oversee 
the treatment facility in Montville once 
it opens.  Although Wallace said the 
most effective registry would categorize 
offenders by risk level, he added that 
research shows no significant correlation 
with registries and reduction of risk of 
recidivism for the offender. In fact, 
some experts say, registries can decrease 
community safety by causing members 
of the public to focus on offenders 
who are strangers to them. Most victims 
of sexual assault, however, know their 
assailants. In relying on the registries for 
information, the public may be ignoring 
threats from people who are closer to 
them.


Why did this ineffective system 
develop? 
Possibly 
because 
early research on sex offenders made 
conclusions based primarily on studies 
on high-risk sex offenders, instead of 
distinguishing them from offenders 
who did not pose a high risk of harm 
to the community, according to David 
D’Amora, an academic expert on 
sex offense at the Council of State 
Governments Justice Center. 


The way academics view sex offense 
today is very different from the way 
they thought about sex offenders a few 
decades ago. Early studies focused only 
on the highest-risk offenders, suggesting 
that sex offenders were drastically 
different from other criminals, D’Amora 
said. Sex offense was treated like an 
incurable behavioral problem that could 
only be managed, such as substance 
abuse, instead of like a curable disease.


“The person is responsible for 
their behavior and needs to be held 
accountable, but that got turned into, 
‘Oh my goodness, they can’t ever 
change,’” D’Amora said. “We went 
too far in trying to think about it.” 
Academics reached conclusions about 
basic characterizations of sex offenders 
that were inconsistent with the reality of 
the situation.


But Wallace said he “adamantly” 
disagreed with the idea that some 
offenders can be cured, adding that 
the reality was more nuanced. Many 
sex offenders have specific incurable 
problems closely related to their sexual 
crimes, such as anger management 
and alcoholism. During the treatment 
process after incarceration, Wallace 
said, the state system determines which 
problems are linked with the offenders’ 
crimes and then creates a therapeutic 
plan to manage them long-term. But 
both agreed that there was a population 
of offenders at low risk for recidivism 
who should be cycled out of the system 
as soon as possible.


Research shows that only a small 
minority of sex offenders recidivate 
and that the majority who do actually 
commit non-sexual crimes correlated 
with factors such as lack of employment 
and 
housing, 
D’Amora 
explained. 
So Szelest’s worst nightmare, being 
kicked out of his home at the Duncan, 
could mean trouble for the rest of the 
community as well, since many of the 
offenders in the Duncan aggregation 
would become homeless.


Indeed, there is a group of sex 
offenders more dangerous than the 
rest, whose crimes are symptoms of 
incurable mental problems. The issue 
is that many laws in states across the 
country have been developed based 
on this small subsection, instead of 
based on empirical studies of the larger 
population, D’Amora said.


“In fact, when we over-respond to 
low-risk offenders, we actually increase 
their failure rate, which does not increase 
community safety,” he said. This 
over-response could deprive low-risk 
offenders of stable housing and jobs, 
making it more likely that they will fail 
to integrate completely into society. Sex 
offenders living in unstable situations are 
more likely to commit crimes that may 
have nothing to do with their original 
offenses, endangering the community.


There is a new trend at the federal 
and state levels toward developing 
policies that are based more on what 
the evidence says works, instead of on 
a “knee-jerk response,” D’Amora said. 
It’s important for low-risk offenders to 
be able to develop appropriate skills, 
behaviors, and relationships in order 
to properly reintegrate into society and 
avoid recidivism.


Boppert and Szelest both lost their 
marriages to their mistakes, and 
both live alone with only minimal contact 
with their families and former friends. 
Palmieri is convinced that the system is 
attempting to ruin his relationship with 
his boyfriend, Sucre Romero, 21, whom 
he met after being released from prison 
and coming out as bisexual. 


Romero is a drag queen performer 
at York Street Café and Palmieri often 
went to his shows to help out backstage. 
But last spring, Palmieri was assigned a 
new probation officer who banned him 
from attending, saying it was sexually 
stimulating and therefore inadvisable. 
When Palmieri complained to the 
Commission on Human Rights and 
Opportunities, he claimed his probation 
officer changed her reasoning for the 
restriction, instead saying it was justified
