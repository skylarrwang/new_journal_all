by the presence of alcohol at Romero’s 
performances. She put a GPS tracking 
device on his ankle to prevent him 
from going, and then several days later 
she wrote up a warrant that said he had 
violated his probation. Palmieri, who 
spent twenty-two days in prison because 
of the warrant, said there was no basis 
for it. He said the probation officer 
had falsely accused him of possessing 
pornographic videos of his boyfriend 
performing in the shows. Palmieri added 
he was fired from his job as a bellhop at 
Hotel Duncan because he had to miss 
work while in prison.

“The twenty-two days I spent in 
prison when she violated me, twenty-
two days away from [Romero]—I was 
a basket case,” he said. “And they say 
they want us to have healthy, 
consenting 
relationships.” 

He is now involved in a court 
case related to the incident 
and was the subject of a June 
30 article in the New Haven 
Register. In that article, he 
was quoted as saying, “You 
can’t keep me from getting 
sexually aroused…Be happy, 
I’m getting sexually aroused 
by adults.”

In 
early 
November, 
Romero tagged along during 
one of my interviews with 
Palmieri at the top level of 
the store Gourmet Heaven. 
There were a few other tables occupied, 
but Palmieri seemed less worried this 
time about being overheard. 
It was easy to see the tension in 
their relationship. Romero lives in New 
York, and Palmieri isn’t allowed to leave 
the state without checking in with his 
probation officer in advance. Sometimes 
Romero makes plans for long-distance 
trips with his friends, and both in the 
couple are disappointed when Palmieri 
cannot get permission to go in time. The 
relationship confused me—I’m less than 
a year younger than Romero and getting 
past a potential partner’s sexual assault 
charge would be difficult for me. I asked 
Romero what his reaction was when 
Palmieri first told him about his legal 
status.

“It was unexpected,” he said, when 
Palmieri revealed the information to 
him after a few weeks of dating. But by 
that time, he had already gotten to know 
his boyfriend and realized that he was 
a good person. That made it easier to 
forgive his mistakes, Romero said.

Not everyone in Palmieri’s life 
has been as understanding. One of his 
probation officers once told him that his 
relationship with Romero was unhealthy, 
because he said Romero looked like a 
14-year-old. One of Romero’s friends 
told Romero he would rather date a 
murderer than a sex offender. Comments 
like this upset Palmieri—people make 
assumptions about him because of his 
charge, before they know anything else 
about what he did or who he is.

He once read an article in a local 
paper interviewing a man released from 
prison after serving more than twenty 
years for killing his wife “in a crime of 
passion.” Palmieri says the article praises 
the man for starting his own business 
and turning his life around after being 
released.

“Never in anybody’s lifetime will we 
see an article like that about someone 
with a sex offense…I can’t be around 
minors, but does this guy have any 
restrictions about getting married again? 
It’s ridiculous,” he says.  

The stigma also harms the people 
who were victims of the original sexual 
assault crimes, said Tina Greaves, director 
of victim advocacy at Connecticut 
Sexual Assault Crisis Services. Victim 
advocates are involved in the probation 
process after a sex offender is released 
from jail. Their job is to make sure the 
victim’s perspective is represented in 
the decisions made about where the 
offenders can live and work. A large 
percentage of sex offenders know their 
victims, so if an offender were to commit 
another sexual crime, it would probably 
involve someone they already know. 
Offenders that are better integrated into 
society after incarceration are less likely 
to commit another crime, so it is safer 
for the victim if the offender has a more 
stable life. 

Last winter, before I 
had even met Palmieri 
or the other offenders, I 
visited the Duncan to talk 
with the hotel’s manager, 
Richard Longo. I told him 
what the interview would 
be about before I got there, 
but he seemed shocked and 
defensive when I brought up 
the topic in person. 
Longo said he hadn’t 
been 
aware 
that 
there 
were, at the time, nine sex 
offenders living in the hotel, 
adding that he didn’t “keep 
tabs on it.” This seemed 
unlikely to me, especially 
since at the time Palmieri was also 
employed there as a bellhop. Longo said 
he had no idea whether the hotel’s other 
patrons were aware of the fact, unless 
“they are savvy with a computer” and he 
refused to comment on whether patrons 
should be told about their offending 
neighbors when moving in. I tried to get 
him to elaborate, but he effectively sent 
me packing. 

I called Longo again this fall, 
equipped with notes from my research 
and interviews. But he again refused to 
comment, even when I informed him 
I would publish the article either way. 
I understand why he was defensive. He 
probably felt as though I was threatening 
the hotel’s future, although he is doing 
Research shows that only a small 
minority of sex offenders recidivate 
and that the majority who do 
actually commit non-sexual crimes 
correlated with factors such as lack 
of employment and housing.

the community a service by taking in the 
sex offenders, whether or not that is his 
intention.

One of the offenders living at the 
Duncan is Joseph Dabrow, who is non-
compliant. The registry indicates that 
Dabrow is guilty of three counts of 
sexual assault in the fourth degree, or 
nonconsensual sexual contact including 
rape. There were no more details about 
the crime. Though he was listed as a 
federal offender, his charge in federal 
court was not identified. But after a 
quick Internet search, I found an article 
in The New York Times from January 27, 
1999, which revealed more detail: As a 
Boy Scout troop leader, Dabrow was 
accused of sexually abusing some of his 
scouts between the ages of 12 and 15, 
groping several and exposing himself to 
others. The federal charge was for illegal 
possession of pornography. He pled 
guilty to the federal charge and asked the 
judge to give him a maximum sentence 
in order to qualify for a sex offender 
treatment program at a federal prison in 
North Carolina, according to the article. 
The law aims to target offenders 
who commit crimes such as Dabrow, 
but offenders who have committed 
nonviolent crimes seem to be getting 
caught in the legal net. I lack the 
information and expertise necessary to 
try to predict whether Palmieri, Boppert, 
and Szelest will commit crimes in the 
future. The state’s new regulations 
promise to make the determination of 
risk easier for people like me, but the 
next step is for the state to legislate 
differently based on those categories. 
Hotel Duncan is striking, not 
necessarily as an example of an 
aggregation, but as an example of a 
place willing to house people who have 
been highly stigmatized in the public eye. 
Driving sex offenders into homelessness 
and into the desperate situations that 
often lead to crime seems dangerous, for 
them and for us. Low-risk offenders with 
homes, jobs, and healthy relationships, 
those who are successfully integrated 
into society, are less likely to resort to 
actions that make our communities 
unsafe. It is a question of pragmatism, 
not forgiveness. The important goal is 
to improve our society by lifting its most 
marginalized members.

Szelest, Boppert and Palmieri agreed 
to talk to me because they are each 
forced to remain at the lowest points in 
their lives. They are constantly looking 
for something else to help them pursue 
normal lives again, to persuade those 
around them that they deserve more. 
Szelest—nicknamed Turtle because 
of his weak chin and broad shoulders—
hardly leaves the Duncan. He was 
abused by his adoptive father as a child 
and developed post-traumatic stress 
disorder, only exacerbated by his time 
in the army and the harassment he has 
faced since prison. He’s on full disability 
pay and sees a clinician on a regular 
basis, often visiting the Veterans Affairs 
hospital in West Haven. Ironically, 
Szelest graduated from paralegal school 
before he was charged and said he gave 
out a lot of legal advice in prison, while 
also researching law on his own time. He 
wants to move on, but he doesn’t know 
how. He’s left with remnants of a family, 
remnants of a life.

“I had plenty before but I don’t 
have any of it now, because I’m not sure 
what to do,” he says. 

Boppert, retired, seems like he has 
the easiest lifestyle compared to the 
other two offenders. He doesn’t have 
to worry about money or employment. 
He is working on finishing his treatment 
program, and although he is near its end, 
he says it could take two or more years 
to finish, depending on his probation 
officer. 

Besides his program, he goes to 
church and does his “Bible stuff” in 
addition to reading and watching a lot 
of television shows. He takes things day 
by day, he says, though sometimes he 
doesn’t feel like a “normal person.”

“Sometimes I cry at night,” he says. 
“That’s how bad it is.”

Palmieri is being evicted from the 
hotel—after losing his job as a bellhop 
there, he won an unemployment hearing 
in October, allowing him to collect 
further compensation from the hotel. 
He said the eviction is probably due 
to that situation. I wanted to hear the 
hotel’s point of view on the dispute, but 
Longo was unwilling to speak with me.  

Palmieri is not sure when he has 
to move out or where he will end up 
living, but he seems resigned to the 
unpredictability of his life.  He is still 
searching for jobs, and he has only 
found two temporary landscaping jobs 
in the last few months. 

Surprisingly, when I last speak with 
Palmieri, he seems less anxious than he’s 
been in past conversations. He says he 
tries to get out of the Duncan as much 
as possible by spending time with his 
boyfriend and with his family. He’s angry 
at a public that deems him perpetually 
guilty and a system that seems to enforce 
this judgment. At the same time, he 
desperately wants to rejoin society. 

“How much more of nothing can I 
have?” he asks. 

The 
state 
probation 
system 
aggregated him with other sex offenders 
in a hotel in a busy street in the city of 
New Haven. This factor, combined with 
his lack of employment, lack of stable 
income and the tension on his most 
meaningful relationship, prevents him 
from living a normal life. And no one 
seems to be helping him. National laws 
and public opinion treat him the same 
as they would a dangerous rapist—a 
different kind of aggregation—making 
it more likely that he’ll end up on the 
street. The main threat to the community 
of Yale University and downtown New 
Haven is not people like Palmieri, but a 
system that makes them more likely to 
commit crime.

Meanwhile, across the country, 
families are sleeping a little more soundly.

he year is 1900, and Ida Bauer 
cannot speak today. She feels like 
she is choking on air. Ida has had 
difficulty breathing and an inability to 
speak for some time now, and her father 
is concerned. 

Ida is 18 years old. She lives with 
her parents and her brother, who is a 
year and a half her senior. Her father 
was treated for a paralytic attack four 
years ago, but nothing in her family’s 
medical history explains Ida’s symptoms. 
There is no neurological explanation for 
loss of voice or problems breathing, or 
for her periodic migraines or fainting 
spells. Yet Ida has sporadically suffered 
variations of some of these symptoms 
since age eight. Her father decides to 
forgo the visits to more conventional 
physicians and has brought Ida straight 
to Dr. Sigmund Freud, the inventor of 
psychoanalysis.

Ida’s case is a typical example of Dr. 
Freud’s early analysis, so typical that he 
finds Ida, and her case, utterly unexciting.

In her conversations with Freud, 
Ida reveals that she has a recurring 
dream. Ida’s father awakens her: The
