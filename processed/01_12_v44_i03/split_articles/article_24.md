When Adam King ’88 looks
at Atwater Street, he sees
wealth. He sees it in the
overgrown backyards that could become
gardens, in the rundown houses whose
extra rooms could become common
spaces, and in the out-of-work residents
whose skills could transform the
neighborhood.

Atwater is in Fair Haven, one
of the poorest areas of New Haven,
Connecticut.
King
was
originally
attracted to this neighborhood, which
lies to the east of the city center, across
the Mill River from more affluent
areas, because it is inexpensive, and he
purchased two houses here in foreclosure
sales last spring. As he describes it, he
drove by a for-sale sign on the street and
made a spur-of-the-moment decision.
“I just said on a whim, ‘I’m going to do
this!’ he said. “ ‘I’m going to start the
process, start moving my life toward
where I want it to head.’ ”

Since then, things have happened
quickly, King said. King, 45, and his
roommates Adam Waschall and Bill
Richo, both in their late twenties, moved
into one of the houses and encouraged
a few friends to invest in neighboring
properties.
Recently,
acquaintances
have also taken both of the unoccupied
apartments in King’s second house.
All the members of the group met
through a shared interest in alternative,
sustainable lifestyles. They currently own
four houses on the street and are looking
to expand. King, Waschall, and Richo
have dubbed the venture the Atwater
Resource Cooperative, or ARC, and they
have a long list of plans for improving
their own lives and those of the people
around them.

The first time I visited their house,
Waschall showed me the backyard,
every inch of which is crammed with
ambitious projects. There’s a chicken
coop full of sleek hens, a pile of materials
for construction on King’s second
house, a cluster of bright blue barrels
for collecting rain water to treat and
use, a compost heap, some solar panels,
and a stack of bins for building raised
garden plots—most of the soil in this
neighborhood is contaminated by lead
and unsuitable for growing food. ARC’s
members hope to someday raise much
of their own food in their backyards and
live as locally as possible.


When he isn’t studying alternative
lifestyles, King, who graduated from Yale
and has a Ph.D. from the University of
California, Los Angeles, is a professor of
computer science at Fairfield University.
He told me his work incorporates
cognitive science and metaphysics. His
enthusiasm for systems and ideas exerted
such a magnetic pull on his answers
to my questions that even the simplest
clarification launched him into a realm
of abstraction. He has a tall, wiry frame
and curly brown hair, and an energy that
always seems just barely contained. He
reminded me of the rabbi at my family’s
synagogue, who always brought social
issues into his sermons and could get
so lost in passionate exhortation that he
spoke for twice his allotted time, never
noticing the children sneaking out of
their seats to start eating the lunch laid
out in the rec hall.

King is at his most fervent when he
talks about money, which he believes is at
the root of all the world’s problems. He
told me modern currency is “everything
and nothing”: everything because people
spend their whole lives trying to obtain
it, and because it’s the glue that binds
together enormous global systems, and
nothing because it’s not what we actually
want—not food, shelter, education, or
leisure.

Driven by this belief, King has
been researching alternative currency
for the last six years. He and Waschall
run SHARE Haven, a timeshare bank
whose
members
accrue
“SHARE
hours” when they help each other with
home improvement, yard clean-up, and
other projects. They spend their hours
by calling on other bank participants to
work for them when they need a hand
around the house. On Atwater Street, as
at the timeshare bank, the plan is to make
less money and spend less money, to
move as far as possible outside a system
that King says has everyone working
