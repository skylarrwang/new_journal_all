O
n November 29, the defense 
rested its case in the sentencing 
trial of Joshua Komisarjevsky. 
In October, Komisarjevsky had been 
convicted of a slew of heinous charges, 
including six capital felonies, due to his 
involvement in a crime significant both 
for its gruesomeness and for the 
national media attention it received. 
Four years ago, on July 23, 2007, 
Komisarjevsky and a man named 
Steven Hayes invaded the home 
of the Petit family—William Petit, 
Jennifer Hawke-Petit, and their 
daughters Michaela and Hayley—
in Cheshire, Connecticut. The 
account of events that emerged 
during the trial is as follows. 
Komisarjevsky beat Petit over the 
head with a baseball bat, tied the 
two girls to their beds, and sexually 
molested Michaela. Hayes raped 
and strangled Hawke-Petit, doused 
the girls’ beds and the house with 
gasoline, and lit a fire. Only William 
Petit survived, his daughters dying 
of smoke inhalation in their 
burning home. In November 2010, 
jurors sentenced Steven Hayes to death. 
A year later, Joshua Komisarjevsky, who 
was convicted of capital offenses, faced 
the possibility of a death sentence.
Komisarjevsky’s 
lawyers 
knew 
they faced an uphill battle, but over the 
course of the six-week sentencing trial, 
they attempted to paint a picture of 
their client as a troubled soul deserving 
of mercy, not a monster. Witnesses 
included Komisarjevsky’s pastors, his 
parole officer from former crimes, and 
his 9-year-old daughter. On November 
29, the defense rested its case and 
submitted a final list of forty-three 
mitigating factors for the jury to consider 
in deciding Komisarjevsky’s sentence.
Factor 2: “Josh was raised in a 
conservative 
evangelical 
Christian 
community.”
Factor 5: “Josh was sexually abused 
by his foster brother.”
Factor 14: “Josh sought out 
nurturing role models.”
Factor 28: “Josh has no history of 
aggression or physical violence.”
Factor 41: “Life imprisonment 
without the possibility of release is a 
sufficiently harsh punishment.”
Factor 43: “Josh is a human being, 
albeit severely damaged, whose life has 
value.”
pposition to the death penalty 
tends to be part of the standard 
liberal political package. I heard about 
the Cheshire murders from a very 
well-informed, very liberal friend. She 
concluded the story with the grave 
coda that if she didn’t oppose the death 
penalty, she’d be hoping that Hayes and 
Komisarjevsky get the needle for what 
they did. I won’t deny that I agreed with 
her. But the state of Connecticut is not 
opposed to the death penalty, according 
to the law. What has been for so long in 
this state a largely symbolic penalty—
rarely applied, carried out even more 
infrequently—has suddenly taken center 
stage in the Cheshire murder trials. The 
system is an expensive, time-consuming 
compromise whereby the state can 
condemn criminals to death without 
having to execute them. But the question 
of whether the state ought to take the 
lives of criminals is a yes-or-no question.
Several weeks into the sentencing 
phase of Joshua Komisarjevsky’s trial, 
a woman named Clare Hogenauer with 
a wheeled walker was sitting outside the 
courthouse where Komisarjevsky’s trial 
was taking place. Dressed in a fuzzy navy 
coat, scraggly tufts of gray hair poking 
out from under a bright pink cap—she 
is often mistaken for a homeless person, 
even though she is a former attorney 
and lives in a Manhattan penthouse—
Hogenauer had surrounded herself 
with signs bearing urgent messages 
to the jurors in Judge Jon Blue’s 
courtroom: “Help Dr. Petit: Vote 
Life!” 
Even 
though 
Petit 
has 
publicly stated his wish to see both 
murderers put to death, Hogenauer 
believes Petit is asking not for 
closure, but for many more years of 
pain. “He just hasn’t quite realized 
it yet,” she said, the wisdom of an 
eccentric great-aunt in her voice. 
“With the appellate process, this 
case goes on for decades, and this 
poor dear and his family would not 
be able to get on with their lives. 
Seeking an execution just eats them 
up with hate, anger, and revenge.” 
Hogenauer spoke of the “other 
victims” of capital punishment: the 
attorneys, judges, jurors, and witnesses 
who are morally and emotionally 
tormented for years after taking part in 
a trial that leads to execution. She told 
stories about lawyers weeping openly 
in court, executioners experiencing 
religious conversions. After all, she has 
had at this for a long time, even while 
battling lymphoma. The death penalty, it 
seems, can also eat up the people who 
fight against it.
“This 
will 
give 
you 
chills,” 
Hogenauer said, extracting a scrap of 
paper from the messy stack of cards and 
receipts in her wallet. It was the corner 
of an envelope, showing a faded return 
address scrawled under the name Michael 
Ross. Ross, who was convicted of raping 
and killing eight women in the early 
1980s, is the only person to be executed 
in Connecticut since the Supreme Court’s 
1976 decision in Gregg v. Georgia, which 
upheld the legality of the death penalty 
after a brief moratorium. In 1994, 
Ross’s death sentence was overturned 
due to the mishandling of psychiatric


Does the understandable 
desire of one heartbroken 
man to seek his version of 
justice override the high 
costs—financial and 
otherwise—of 
capital punishment?
