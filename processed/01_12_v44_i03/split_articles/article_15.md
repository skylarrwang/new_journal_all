Chairigami 
was 
getting 
media 
attention even before business took 
off. By mid-November, Rotholz had 
made around ten thousand dollars in 
revenue. A steady stream of customers 
orders cardboard chairs, sofas, shelves, 
and tables for homes, offices, and dorm 
rooms. A wave of publicity hit Rotholz 
at the end of November, when he 
was featured on Connecticut’s WFSB 
Channel 3 Eyewitness News. CNN 
also broadcast the two-minute clip. 
Overnight, Rotholz’s Web site received 
fifteen thousand hits. E-mails poured in. 
Some people wanted to order furniture; 
others attached images of their own 
ideas for cardboard innovation.
Rotholz 
has 
received 
several 
requests to complete big projects. The 
first one he’s accepted is to design an 
entire office’s worth of furniture for a 
tech startup located in downtown New 
Haven. He claims that the furniture he 
sells suits the “urban nomad” way of 
life, because it is conveniently light and 
quick to assemble, recyclable, and easy to 
personalize.


Rotholz is ambivalent about his 
success. “A lot of people are saying ‘Go 
Zach!’ I feel like people are rooting for 
me more than I’m rooting for myself,” 
he said. “It’s a kind of weird cognitive 
dissonance. People are saying good job, 
but I feel like I’m not doing much. I 
wouldn’t rather be doing anything else, 
so I really have nothing to complain 
about. But I’m stuck in a rut right now.”


Appearing on national television 
isn’t a source of pride for Rotholz. He 
says he’s uncertain about whether he 
deserves all the publicity he’s getting. 
The notoriety was so easy to achieve, he 
says, that it disturbs him. “It feels like a 
big balloon, you know? It’s so empty.”


Rotholz thinks of his store as a 
place to meet new people and exchange 
ideas, a kind of “social experiment,” he 
said, but not as a permanent home for 
his talent. Initially, he wanted to see if 
people would buy his cardboard designs 
and to change the way some people think 
about furniture and environmentally 
sustainable lifestyles. 


When Rotholz secured his lease 
for the storefront late last summer, his 
supporters, including vice president 
of New Haven and State Affairs and 
Campus Development Bruce Alexander 
’65, expected Chairigami to expand 
quickly and eventually to provide jobs 
to members of the local community. 
But Rotholz is not sure he wants to 
expand, and he’s not sure he likes being 
a manager. He has not yet committed 
to a long-term plan. Rotholz’s lease 
was initially scheduled to end on 
September 30, and then it was extended 
to December 30. He doesn’t know how 
much longer he wants to stay in New 
Haven; he hasn’t decided if he wants to 
set up a store somewhere else, or if he 
just wants to run his business through 
his Web site. He bikes to work each day 
in a Charigami T-shirt, well-worn jeans, 
and Converse sneakers. 


He also says he wants to work at 
his own pace. Rotholz has turned down 
offers from several potential investors, 
afraid of losing control to a “shark”—
his term for a successful, experienced, 
fast-talking entrepreneur who might take 
advantage of the naïveté of someone 
like Rotholz. He has accepted two 
interns to help with manufacturing, but 
every few weeks, another design student 
who has heard of Chairigami’s success 
sends Rotholz a résumé, or brings in a 
portfolio. Still, he wants to keep things 
simple. No one has given Rotholz 
instructions, but he’s been learning how 
to deal with everything that goes into 
running a business, from lawyers to 
trademarks. 


One of Rotholz’s “sharks” marched 
into the store on a Friday night in 
November. The businessman almost 
immediately suggested partnering with 
Chairigami on a major project. “What 
if I ordered five thousand dollars worth 
of chairs and tables right now? Would 
you be able to handle that capacity?” he 
asked. 


“I don’t know. I’d do my best,” 
Rotholz responded. 


Later, the two sat down on 
one of the cardboard sofas, and the 
businessman pulled out his iPhone to 
show Rotholz a picture of his newborn 
baby. “Wow, congratulations,” said 
Rotholz, genuinely but calmly.


“How much do you care about 
making money?” asked the entrepreneur.


Rotholz shrugged and shook his 
head. “Not much.” They shook hands 
and promised to further discuss project 
details soon.


“I hate charging people money,” 
Rotholz told me. “I never know if I’m 
overcharging or undercharging. I wish I 
could just use a bartering system. Like, 
‘I’ll make you this, and you can make me 
food.’ ”


Many more people visit Chairigami 
as friends than as customers. Strangers 
drop by to give moral support. Local 
musicians leave handwritten “business 
cards” with him and tell him to check 
out their Web sites. A man Rotholz 
suspected to be schizophrenic walked 
into the store just because he was lonely 
and needed someone to talk to. 


Rotholz speaks readily with these 
visitors without betraying any desire to 
impress. People are very generous with 
their kind words and advice, he said. 
Often, because they share so much 
of their lives and ideas with him, he is 
inspired to design new things that people 
want—an iPad stand, a toddler’s chair, a 
beer pong table. 


Sometimes visitors challenge him, 
but at this point, Rotholz doesn’t feel the

need to persuade people to accept his 
concepts or his designs. 


“Kind of a fire hazard, huh?” a man 
suggested.


“Just as much of one as the library 
across the street,” Rotholz replied.


“The products should be able to 
speak for themselves,” he said to me. 
“Personally, I’m not attached to the 
objects I make. I’m attached to the 
process. Since I’m never really satisfied, 
never truly proud of anything I make, 
I’m not so attached to the final product. 
I don’t linger.” 


Rotholz has memorized most of 
his designs; he doesn’t usually need to 
consult his notes for measurements 
and procedures. He folds and cuts the 
cardboard without hesitation or the aid 
of a ruler, drawing the blade through the 
material in swift and steady slices. “After 
I designed my first chair, everything was 
somehow derived from that,” he said. 


If Rotholz could spend all his time 
making furniture, he would be happy. 
He says he would much rather work as 
a member of a team, manufacturing all 
day, than manage the whole operation. 
It’s really hard to be your own boss, he 
says. “Marketing is really weird. You have 
to create the need, create the problem,” 
he said. “I want to solve problems.”


As a child, Rotholz’s Lego creations 
never lasted for more than a few 
moments. After building something, he’d 
quickly take it apart to start on something 
new. He wouldn’t linger on his products 
then, and he doesn’t linger on his 
cardboard creations now. But Rotholz 
says his mother recently reminded him 
that Chairigami has real promise, and 
the company is worth sustaining and 
developing. Rotholz’s challenge now 
is not innovation or persuasion. What 
he needs is the conviction to stick to 
Chairigami.
