It’s already past 10 a.m., but campus 
is silent on a Sunday morning. The 
overcast sky is the color of cream 
of wheat, and clouds linger placidly 
overhead. The cool November air feels 
too sleepy to stir, and there’s not a hint 
of a breeze. I’m anxious to get on the 
road to my aunt’s home in Simsbury, 
Connecticut and the Massachusetts 
border, but haste would upset the 
composure of the moment. Then again, 
I have a 112-mile day in front of me.


I’d been kicking around the idea 
for this ride since a confrontation with 
a cloyingly sweet cupcake a few weeks 
earlier, at a particularly bad time in my 
life. “There’s far too much frosting on 
this cupcake,” I can remember thinking. 
My parents and I had each been staring 
into space for the last ten minutes. My 
mother sat on my dorm-room mattress. 
My father had chosen the beanbag chair. 
I keep my equipment in my room, so we 
were crowded. One of my bicycles rested 
in a repair stand a few feet above the 
ground. The other machine lay against 
the wall. A set of carbon racing wheels 
filled the fireplace, and various solvents, 
lubricants, spare parts, and tools lined 
the mantle. I had bargained hard for 
the only single in Branford College with 
two walk-in closets to accommodate my 
jerseys, jackets, and socks, which all the 
same lay strewn on the floor.


I was munching on a giant, goopy 
Halloween cupcake, but the sweetness 
disgusted me. The toothpaste-green 
frosting didn’t help matters either. I 
pushed it away. 


I was in a bad place that night. We 
had come upstairs when my voice began 
to tighten in the dining hall. It had been 
a semester so far of tearful phone calls, 
late-night flashes of panic, and trips to 
Health Services. Somehow, I was mis-
shifting. A lingering, lurking anxiety—
about my future, about my inadequacies, 
real or imagined—had dropped the 
chain, and my pedals were spinning. 
The thought of the time, expense, and 
care my parents had so generously 
given me only deepened the shame of 
the moment. I needed a day to be more 
than a harried, sleepless college student. 
I needed to do something to remind 
myself why I’d come here for school.


A long time ago, I caught the “New 
England bug”— chiefly a dream about 
family roots, the Ivy League, and Robert 
Frost poems. My father’s family is from 
Glastonbury, not far east of his sister’s 
home in Simsbury, where we had visited 
her many years ago. After that trip, 
I liked to imagine myself as a young 
California whippersnapper returning 
to his Connecticut roots for a proper 
university education. While I had made 
it to New Haven, I hadn’t gotten around 
to visiting my aunt and uncle, and I 
hadn’t seen them in nearly seven years. 
Reconnecting with them after a ride 
through the Connecticut countryside 
seemed like a healthy, sane thing to do. 
If I was going as far as Simsbury, I might 
even ride to the end of the Farmington 
Canal Trail at the Massachusetts border, 
fifteen miles farther north.


Bicycles don’t have faces, but every 
night the one on my stand stared me 
right in the kisser. There it was, repaired, 
poised, expectant, reproachful. The thick 
welds and wide tubes towered above 
my room, waiting only for a willing 
companion. I needed a day to myself, 
and that meant a day on my bike.


I’ve forgotten my sunglasses. Despite 
my three spare tubes, a hand pump, a 
mini-tool, pockets bulging with energy 
gels, arm warmers, leg warmers, a rear 
light, and about every other bike-related 
knickknack imaginable, I always forget 
something important when I’m going 
out on a ride. On the other hand, at least 
people will be able to look me in the 
eye. Maybe they’ll see a person and not a 
spectacled, spandex-encased alien. 
Never in two years of riding around 
southern Connecticut have I really 
biked the Farmington Canal Trail, built 
over what was once an actual canal. 
Enterprising 
merchants 
completed 
the Farmington Canal running north 
from New Haven Harbor to the state 
border in 1835 in the early, heady days 
of American industrialization. The 
canal ran fifty-eight miles and featured 
an elaborate system of culverts and 
channels to supply its water from nearby 
streams. Numerous side channels and 
holding basins to accommodate two-
way traffic adorned the canal route. The 
canal itself, however, was little more than 
a glorified ditch—unlined, with a bare 
earthen bottom. 


Just over a decade later, the canal 
was filled and covered with railroad 
when shipping by train became more 
affordable.

burnt-
orange signs warn cyclists and runners

Mark Gambardella knows well 
what could lie ahead for his players. “I 
had one team that, right now, my first 
baseman has killed a teacher at Cross, 
my shortstop put an ice pick down at 
Fireside Café into somebody’s back, my 
catcher did armed robbery,” he said. 
(Cross is a nickname for Wilbur Cross 
High School in New Haven.)


Baseball doesn’t just keep Jericho 
out of trouble. It offers a home to the 
whole Scott family, from four-year-old 
Carizma, who is Jericho’s most loyal fan, 
to Jericho’s older brother Alex, who also 
played for Gambardella. Nicole joined 
the ranks of youth baseball coaches this 
season, signing on to lead a tee-ball team 
that included her young daughters. Next 
year, she says, two of her daughters will 
be playing for Gambardella, who also 
coaches girls. Even sitting in the stands 
is important to Nicole, who said she 
doesn’t hang out much around their 
home. Jericho’s team includes many 
families from outside Fair Haven, and 
early Saturday mornings at the local field 
and late evenings on tournament trips to 
Long Island have built friendships that 
the family holds dear. “That’s what we 
do,” Nicole said. “We get dressed in the 
summer and we’re at the baseball park. 
That’s where we’re at all day.”


Then there’s Gambardella, who 
played as a boy in the same league in 
which Jericho now plays and has spent 
the last thirty-two years coaching youth 
baseball, seven of them with Jericho. In 
terms of cost and time, Gambardella 
offers the Scotts and other families a 
bargain they won’t find elsewhere. He 
started a small new league this summer 
because parents’ other options were too 
expensive, and twice as many kids signed 
up as he expected. Gambardella and 
his son simply doubled their coaching 
duties. “We made a commitment,” he 
said.  


“Mark is part of our family, outside 
of sports,” Nicole said. The man whose 
connection to Jericho was forged 
through hundreds of pitch signals now 
comes to every birthday party and 
graduation ceremony. He was there 
recently as the family mourned the death 
of Nicole’s grandmother, who had lived 
with Nicole her whole life.  


Gambardella can identify with 
his players. “I was no angel growing 
up, either,” he said. He knows that his 
duties extend into foul territory and well 
beyond the fence. “We try to teach ’em 
life. I like to give ’em someone to talk to 
outside of their family.”  


Jericho 
has 
been 
begging 
Gambardella to coach an older team next 
year so that he doesn’t have to move on. 
“He’s like a father to me,” Jericho said. 
“And my mom. More like a grandfather 
to me.”


I wanted to tell this story without

any made-for-TV moralizing. But for 
the Scotts, Jericho’s story does have a 
moral—an important one. They depend 
on baseball to teach in an immediate, 
physical 
way 
lessons 
that 
aren’t 
communicated elsewhere in Fair Haven. 
In the old news stories, the Scotts’ 
complaints about the bad message the 
league was sending sounded trite. In 
person, their claims were urgent and 
alive. “I teach him, whatever you do, try 
to be the best at it, in school and baseball 
and everything else,” Nicole said. “He 
wasn’t doing anything wrong.”  


Leroy’s voice rang with the same 
intensity as his wife’s. “If you practice 
hard enough, you can be the best you 
can be,” he said, after I asked him why 
the incident made him so angry.


Now, Jericho sometimes finds 
himself unable to keep up with older 
kids’ fastballs. “Am I gonna say ‘I don’t 
want him playing and your kid can’t pitch 
to him anymore’?” Nicole asked. “If my 
kid can’t hit, then he needs to practice 
more. He needs to go to the batting cage 
and turn it up a little bit and practice 
more. You can’t hit ’em today, but next 
time you will. And sure enough he does.”



Back in his room, Jericho mostly 
mumbles through our conversation 
about baseball.  But his voice perks up 
for the first time when he tells me that 
he also likes to draw. He shows me a 
handsome sketch of Goofy he made—
nose wrinkled, eyes protruding, face lit 
in bright Crayola hues—with a note for 
his mom on her birthday. He has more, 
he says—his favorite piece is a picture of 
a skull and crossbones with guns—but 
they’re all packed away. After all, months 
of attention taught Jericho what I’m 
really interested in. He takes an 8.5 x 11 
glossy photo from a stack in the kitchen 
and offers to sign it for me. “Thank you 
for your support,” he writes.

“I had one team that, right 
now, my first baseman has 
killed a teacher at Cross, 
my shortstop put an ice pick 
down at Fireside Café into 
somebody’s back, my catcher 
did armed robbery.”

Scotts raised money for a lawsuit against 
the league and the league held press 
conferences defending its decision, 
media outlets around the country trained 
their gaze on Jericho and turned a few bad 
decisions into a morality tale for the ages. 
It started when Jericho’s mother, Nicole, 
brought the story to News Channel 8 in 
New Haven. Soon journalists descended 
on Jericho’s home. Jimmy Kimmel and 
Jay Leno came calling. Mourn the enforced 
mediocrity of  our youth! yelled talking heads 
on ESPN. Look at the home mortgage crisis 
if  you think youth baseball is the only place 
where people are no longer allowed to fail! 
wrote others. Jericho was featured in a 
three-minute segment on the CBS Early 
Show in which he’s seen pitching on a 
sidewalk in New York City. He fumbles 
his catcher’s nervous return tosses and 
hides behind his mother’s legs as a crowd 
looks on. The eager host exclaims at a 
47-mile-per-hour fastball that is in fact 
average speed for a nine-year-old.


It was a display of rampant 
journalistic moralizing, though Jericho 
and his parents say they never felt 
victimized by the media. But why did 
Jericho become a national media figure 
in the first place? I was amazed when 
I stopped to think about what Nicole 
reportedly yelled that August afternoon. 
“This will be the last year,” she shouted. 
“Once the lawyer is done they’re gonna 
eat shit and there ain’t gonna be a league 
next year.” I wanted to know why it 
mattered so much to her and to those 
close to her son.


Nicole runs a lively, orderly home in 
the rundown community of Fair 
Haven. Outside, teenagers hang out on 
street corners and trash litters abandoned 
yards. Inside, when I visit her, Nicole 
gracefully juggles the needs of her three 
daughters, who all have come down with 
a bug. She passes judgment on requests 
for soda and Wii as we talk about her 
children. “This neighborhood’s not 
the best,” she says. “I try to keep them 
focused on doing things to stay positive, 
enrolled in stuff so they’re not in the 
neighborhood.” Leroy, Jericho’s dad, 
stops in for dinner between a full day at 
work as an auto mechanic and a class his 
union is holding.


Jericho is an A student and a self-
professed “neat freak” who has become 
one of the best thirteen-year-old 
pitchers in New Haven, according to 
his long-time coach Mark Gambardella. 
Gambardella 
coached 
the 
better-
organized spring outfit on which Jericho 
played before and since the pitching 
incident. Yet still, Jericho’s parents 
worry. “You don’t want me to talk about 
Jericho,” Leroy said abruptly when I 
called. “Me and him, we’re having a 
tough time.” As Leroy sees it, Jericho’s 
been dealt a good hand—two parents, a 
stable home, a supportive coach—and 
hasn’t quite had his eyes opened to the 
misery that is only a few bad decisions 
away for him. “He doesn’t know what it’s 
like to have nothing.”  


Jericho has never been in serious 
trouble, but Leroy wants him not to 
forget that his talent and upbringing 
alone won’t save him in a town where 
“you have fourteen-year-olds holding 
pistols.” Jericho carries himself with 
self-assuredness, but both Leroy and 
Gambardella know a sensitive boy 
beneath the “city front.” 


“I’m not sure how strong he is on 
his own,” Gambardella said.


Once the public outcry against the 
league’s injustice faded, the Scotts 
became easy targets for criticism. John 
Williams, the prominent New Haven 
civil rights attorney who handled the 
Scotts’ lawsuit, describes the case now as 
a “typical example when adults meddle 
needlessly in the lives of their children.” 
Craig Fehrman, a graduate student in 
English at Yale and the reporter who 
covered Jericho’s story for Deadspin, 
a sports news Web site, told me that 
Nicole and Leroy “were putting a bad 
energy into the kid, where the way he 
performed in sports was a reflection of 
them.”


Nicole, who admits that she and 
Leroy are “the loud parents” at games, 
can certainly be held responsible for 
feeding the media fire. Gambardella said 
that “Jericho would have stayed probably 
quiet if it was up to him.” Nicole still 
thinks that her lawsuit against the league 
will make it to court and vindicate her, 
even though Williams says he gave up 
years ago. “It could go on till Jericho’s 19 
years old,” she proclaimed.


And the notoriety has worn on 
Jericho. “He doesn’t show it, but it’s 
really hard on him,” Leroy said. “With 
the exposure he’s had, it’s a little worse 
for him. He’s known in the community. 
You can’t be an average kid egging 
someone’s house on Halloween.”


Yet to criticize the Scotts for their 
stubbornness would be to ignore the 
central place baseball occupies in their 
lives. Baseball is not a peripheral passion 
for the Scotts, a game during which 
they relax their parenting principles and 
indulge in narcissism. In a neighborhood 
they mistrust, the stakes are high, and 
baseball is the game to which they cling 
for signs that Jericho is the courageous 
boy they need so badly to see. For better 
or for worse, baseball is the community, 
the coach, and the ethics that the Scotts 
are betting will guide Jericho into 
adulthood.

“This will 
be the last 
year,” Nicole 
shouted. “Once 
the lawyer is 
done they’re 
gonna eat shit 
and there 
ain’t gonna be 
a league next 
year.”
