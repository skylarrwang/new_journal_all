I paused before entering The 
Grove, a sleek “coworking” space on 
Orange Street. Someone inside opened 
the door for me and said, “Don’t be shy.” 
In fact, I was hardly noticed. It was a 
Sunday afternoon, and Startup Weekend 
New Haven, a three-day marathon 
of networking, pitching, coding, and 
designing, was drawing to a close. 
Startup Weekend, a nonprofit 
organization, has been holding similar 
marathons around the world since 2007. 
This was the first in New Haven. Eighty 
participants from across the country 
attended between November 11 and 
13. Most were from the New Haven 
area, but others hailed from New York, 
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Virginia, 
and 
Ohio. 
They 
included 
adults, 
students, and a precocious adolescent 
from Catherine M. McGee Middle 
School in Berlin, Connecticut. 
Later that day, fourteen teams would 
demonstrate their work to an audience 
of about 140 people. The winner 
would receive funding, legal services, 
Web hosting, and space to develop the 
project—all crucial ingredients for a 
new business. With the deadline fast 
approaching, team members—many 
of whom hadn’t met before Friday 
afternoon—were scrambling to finalize 
business pitches and polish their work. 
They were sleep-deprived and over-
caffeinated, but their enthusiasm was 
still obvious. “Things get done when 
people roll up their sleeves and do work 
together,” said event organizer Derek 
Koch. The eventual victorious startups 
were Shuga Trak, software for teenagers 
with diabetes that connects glucose 
meters to mobile phones; MeritBooster.
com, a Web site to raise money for youth 
projects; and SociaBO, a dating app. One 
of the founders of MeritBooster.com 
was that lone thirteen-year-old, Keshav 
Patel.


There are currently around fifty 
startups in New Haven, most of 
them in information technology or 
biotechnology. Connecticut Innovations 
operates a program at Yale’s Science 
Park that gives tech startups office space 
and access to resources. That program 
has reached capacity, and new venues—
among them The Grove and another 
called 
The 
Bourse—have 
opened 
to provide more working space for 
startups. They encourage “coworking,” 
or collaborative work in shared space. 
Those familiar with the New Haven 
startup scene say that the city has plenty 
to offer entrepreneurs. Ben Berkowitz is 
one of the founders of SeeClickFix, a 
New Haven-based company that allows 
people to report neighborhood issues to 
their local governments online. He finds 
New Haven a “less distracting” place to 
work that is still convenient to New York 
City. He may be biased—he also designs 
and sells popular “New Haven. It’s better 
than your town” T-shirts—but New 
Haven’s startup scene is certainly more 
successful than Hartford’s, Bridgeport’s, 
or New London’s. The concentration of 
talent and resources here has reached 
a critical mass, creating a city that is 
financially and socially appealing to 
those wishing to start companies. 


In October, Governor Dannel 
Malloy launched Startup Connecticut 
to 
promote 
this 
entrepreneurial 
culture throughout the state, investing 
$25 million a year for the next five 
years. Startup Connecticut belongs 
to the Startup America Partnership, a

national organization created to give 
entrepreneurs funding and guidance. 
Startup America unites an alliance 
of private-sector organizations while 
pushing for public policy that would 
make the entire country more hospitable 
to entrepreneurship. Connecticut is only 
the third state to have its own chapter.


Connecticut has traditionally 
hosted fewer new startups and small 
companies than other states. New 
York City and Boston dominate the 
entrepreneurial scene in this part of 
the country. But Connecticut’s strong 
educational institutions and established 
engineering companies, such as Pratt 
& Whitney, United Technologies, and 
General Electric, could help the state 
to encourage new businesses. Those 
behind Startup Connecticut hope to 
transform the state into a model of 
entrepreneurship by harnessing these 
resources while providing generous 
funding and tax breaks. 


Entrepreneurs and their funders 
don’t always see eye-to-eye on the best 
way to turn the state into a startup 
hotbed. The goal of Startup Connecticut 
is to create many jobs quickly. Its stated 
mission is to “launch many more startups 
in a much shorter timeframe” while also 
supporting smaller firms, according to 
its Web site. But some entrepreneurs 
say it can take time to develop the right 
conditions for good new companies. 
Miles Lasater, an entrepreneur 
involved with Higher One, which aims 
to help universities with their financial 
aid systems, wrote in an e-mail that 
building a productive environment for 
startups could take decades. “It will take 
sustained attention and work by all the 
players to continue to focus,” he wrote.


Startup Connecticut is an ambitious 
endeavor, and experienced entrepreneurs 
note that new projects may take some 
time to enact. “Creative development 
takes time, though it is true that creativity 
can happen in a flash,” said Jonathan 
Feinstein, a professor at Yale’s School 
of Management. “It can take years to 
lay the groundwork for those creative 
moments.” Still, although the effects of 
Startup Connecticut remain to be seen, 
most agree that Connecticut is a much 
more exciting place for entrepreneurs 
than it was even six months ago.

**Ghosts On the Green**
**Page number(s): 9**

It’s impossible to know just how 
many bones lie below the surface of the 
New Haven Green, but there are certainly 
more than nine hundred skeletons’ 
worth, belonging to six generations of 
early New Haven residents. The remains 
of the colonial city’s settlers, magistrates, 
soldiers, slaves, and merchants were 
interred here centuries ago. If you were 
to walk the lawn on a grim winter night, 
you might sense something otherworldly 
flitting among the benches and trees 
of the city’s historical center. Near 
the flagpole, you might unknowingly 
tread on the final resting place of Isaac 
Allerton, a pilgrim who arrived on these 
shores with the Mayflower. Or those of 
Governor Theophilus Eaton, the first 
governor of the colony of New Haven 
from 1639 to 1658, and his son-in-law 
Deputy Governor William Jones, whose 
dust sleeps close to the northwest corner 
of Center Church. 


Dust, bones, or fraying cuffs, 
there’s no predicting the current state 
of these corpses, said Connecticut 
state archeologist Nicholas Bellantoni. 
“Survival of organic materials all 
depends on soil acidity,” he explained. 
“If we were to exhume the graves, we 
could find perfectly intact bodies or all 
that remains could be rusting nails.” 


colonial 
community 
congregated in death under the Green, 
but they also gathered there in life, 
bringing their horses, black coats, Bibles, 
and long, gathered dresses to talk about 
political issues and to buy and sell 
goods. With three churches, occasional 
social gatherings, and more recently, 
the encampment of the Occupy New 
Haven protesters, the Green still retains 
part of its original function as the city’s 
meeting ground. It was, as Reverend Dr. 
Leonard Bacon said in 1879, a place “for 
the concourse of the people, for all such 
public uses as were reserved of old by 
the forum at Rome.” It was unusual for 
a colonial New England city to bury its 
dead beneath its green, though Boston 
was another that used its common as a 
burial ground. 


The unfenced cemetery eventually 
extended to all corners of the Green, and
