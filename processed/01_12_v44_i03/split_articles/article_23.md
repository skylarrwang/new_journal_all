EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Freud’s wilder theories have been 
discredited again and again, and 
the story of how the influence of 
psychoanalysis has waned since his time 
is a familiar one. Still, there are those 
who are drawn, for whatever reasons, to 
the discipline he established, including a 
sizable community of psychoanalysts in 
New Haven.


Marshal Mandelkern is a member 
of that community. Before his training as 
a psychoanalyst, he remembers writing a 
letter he was ambivalent about mailing. 
As he asked himself whether he should 
mail it, he decided to look up the address 
just in case. He searched his entire desk 
drawer, where he always kept his address 
book, but couldn’t find the book, and 
couldn’t mail the letter. He set the letter 
aside. A week later, he was reaching for 
his stapler, and saw his address book 
sitting on top of the desk drawer, where 
it had always been.  
“I had been looking for it, but 
couldn’t see it,” he says. “Not because 
I was blind, or because it was dark, but 
because psychologically, I created this 
blind spot. A conflict I was having could 
unconsciously emerge as a physical 
symptom like this, of not being able to 
see something.” 


This incident is an example of 
a parapraxis, the clinical term for a 
“Freudian slip,” and it prompted 
Mandelkern to apply to the Western New 
England Institute for Psychoanalysis. 
Mandelkern wanted to understand 
the levels of the mind beneath his 
consciousness.


	 The main floor of the institute’s 
building on Bradley Avenue has four 
classrooms, for classes of ten or fifteen 
people (one classroom doubling as a 
kitchen) and a library. Comprehensive 
psychoanalytic libraries are infamously 
difficult to maintain, and with Yale’s 
many libraries down the street, Western 
New England’s collection of books and 
journals is treated more like a reading 
room. Training includes five years of 
courses in these classrooms, and usually 
requires eight to ten years altogether.   


To graduate from the institute, 
students 
must 
complete 
a 
major 
paper and submit to psychoanalysis 
themselves. Training at Western New 
England is in orthodox or classical 
Freudian psychoanalysis, which differs 
from more conventional psychotherapy 
in that analysis requires more weekly 
sessions in which doctors participate 
more actively. This means four or five 
one-hour appointments a week, and 
it means time, money, and emotional 
commitment that most people cannot 
afford. 


Freud first developed orthodox 
psychoanalysis, which was governed 
by a few major thinkers for decades. 
Eventually, devotion to the original 
model declined, and the psychoanalytic 
umbrella opened—to shelter a new 
generation, conflict within the field, and 
divisions that couldn’t have existed in 
1900.


Most 
of 
the 
forty 
trained 
psychoanalysts at Western New England 
spend a minority of their time performing 
orthodox psychoanalysis. Mandelkern 
spends two thirds of his time practicing 
general psychiatry at St. Raphael’s 
Hospital, where his patients generally 
have obvious psychiatric disorders, and 
a third of it at his own private practice, 
where patients usually come in unhappy 
for 
various 
reasons. 
Mandelkern’s 
time at his private practice is not spent 
practicing orthodox psychoanalysis. His 
patients come in once or twice a week, 
not four or five times.


Yet few fields are so dominated by 
one founding figure. There are and will 
always be reading groups, courses, and 
seminars devoted solely to Freud at 
Western New England.


In their sessions, Freud “uses the 
couch” for Ida. Using the couch 
means two things for the patient. She 
lies down—relaxing her body while 
free associating—and, as the doctor sits 
behind the couch, she does not have to 
see his reactions to her associations. Nor 
must the doctor control his face as he 
listens. They are both further freed from 
social conventions, cues, and anxieties. 


Since beginning treatment, Ida has 
experienced coughing attacks lasting 
three to five weeks, attacks so severe she 
has lost her voice several times, slowing 
down the unraveling of her story. Yet 
slowly but surely it does unravel: the 
powerful attachment to her father; his 
recovery from tuberculosis in a town 
away from home; the couple (“Herr K.” 
and “Frau K.”) he meets and grows close 
to while there; Ida’s many encounters 
with the K. family children as their 
babysitter; Herr K.’s sexual advances 
onto Ida; Ida’s father’s close friendship 
and possible long-term love affair with 
Frau K. despite his impotence; Herr K.’s 
and Ida’s father’s insistence that she had 
imagined the advances. 


	 Ida had the dream about the fire 
three nights in a row while staying at the 
lake where Herr and Frau K. live after 
Herr K. kissed her unexpectedly. Freud 
considers aloud facts relating to the 
dream, for example that Herr K. once 
gave a jewel case to Ida as a gift and that 
“jewel case” is slang for female genitals. 
He interprets the dream as Ida’s desire 
to protect her “jewel case” and her 
conviction that if anything happened, 
her father would be to blame. The dream 
expresses all of these unconscious 
feelings in the opposite, meaning Ida 
has repressed a sexual attraction to Herr 
K. He notes that she loses her voice for 
the same amount of time that Herr K. is 
away, and in a poetic sweep Freud solves 
the case: because speech has no meaning 
when the person she loves is not there 
to hear it, her loss of voice is a small 
demonstration of her repressed desire 
for Herr K.

orthodox analysis in his practice 
is modern, as is his prescription of 
medication as treatment. For many 
patients, drugs are more reliable and 
cost-effective. Today, more than one in 
ten Americans over the age of twelve 
is on an anti-depressant. Use has 
quadrupled in twenty-five years.


During and after the Second World 
War, psychoanalysis enjoyed a heyday 
that lasted until the 1960s. In those 
years, there was nowhere else to turn, 
and psychoanalysis seemed to be able to 
treat almost anything. “Seem” was the 
crucial word. Starting in the 1970s, new 
disciplines of medicine developed and 
began to compete with psychoanalysis, 
and the field was slowly marginalized. 
There was no return to the golden age: 
doctors, patients, and skeptics continue 
to refer to the decline of psychoanalysis.


Talking was already going out 
of style by the 1960s, when effective 
medications for depression, anxiety, 
and various psychotic disorders were 
designed. In those booming postwar 
years, sessions became less frequent, 
patients’ stays in analysis became shorter, 
and analysts began to interrupt patients 
more freely, deliberately influencing 
progress instead of acting as a blank 
vessel. As doctors engaged more with 
patients, patients were talking less.


Phillips, however, thinks Western 
New England stands today on the 
cusp of a resurgence of interest in 
psychoanalysis, both in the general 
public and in the academy. Just as lofty 
notions of the power of psychoanalysis 
were deflated following its golden age, 
so the sexiness of biological psychiatry 
is fading, and views of these medications 
are becoming more realistic. 


“The be-all end-all antidepressent 
medications that they thought would 
solve everything, don’t, and what’s more 
is they have a lot of side effects,” said 
Phillips, who uses medications with his 
own patients.  


Dr. 
Carole 
Goldberg 
agrees 
that there will always be a place for 
psychoanalysis despite the commitment 
of time and money it requires. Also 
a member of Western New England, 
Goldberg serves as the director of 
the Sexual Harassment and Assault 
Response and Education Center at Yale 
and practices sex counseling at Yale’s 
Mental Health & Counseling and in her 
private practice.


Goldberg believes there is a 
movement back toward asking “how we 
explore our inner world in a meaningful 
way,” rather than medicating the ups and 
downs of emotions. She sees a parallel 
in the medicalization of sex therapy with 
the invention of medications like Viagra 
and Cialis to treat erectile dysfunction. 
 “They helped with these disorders, 
and they were terrific. But in medicating 
these issues, we lose the opportunity 
to talk to one another. And the most 
intimate thing you do with another 
person is to talk to them,” she said. 


The combination of medication and 
psychotherapy works better than either 
one alone, and Goldberg attributes the 
allure of psychoanalysis to the self-
understanding it can provide, something 
medication cannot offer.


Mandelkern said that psychoanalytic 
ideas 
and 
insights 
recently 
have 
been considered more useful, and in 
more ways. He predicts an organic 
incorporation of newer fields into the 
psychoanalysis of the future.  


“It’ll be a younger generation, 
younger than me, that takes what’s good 
out of psychoanalysis, that takes what’s 
good from cognitive science, from 
various cognitive behavioral therapies, 
from a variety of other interventions, 
and creates new paths forward, without 
feeling like they have to pay undue 
homage to the past. Which has been a 
big factor for psychoanalysis, tracing 
everything back to Freud.”


Psychoanalysis is still emerging from 
underneath the Freudian penumbra, 
according to Mandelkern—and the 
process has lasted for twenty or thirty 
years. “Just now the field is willing to 
move on and say, ‘Yes, Freud was a great 
thinker, with great insights, and great 
creativity, but he had certain limitations 
and we have to move on,’ ” he says.


Mandelkern owns a pair of slippers 
bearing a cartoon of Freud’s face—
Freudian slippers.


Whether she is aware of it or not, 
so much depends on Ida’s “jewel 
case.” Her emotions and her body are 
thoroughly intertwined.


Ida wakes up from her dreams 
smelling smoke. Freud understands the 
odor as a clear sign that Ida is conflating 
her father, Herr K., and the doctor 
himself—all three smokers in her life, all 
men toward whom he believes she has 
felt sexually. This is an instance, then, of 
transference, a redirection of her sexual 
feelings from Herr K. to Freud himself.  


As 
it 
was 
in 
Freud’s 
time, 
psychoanalysis is as much about 
the doctor as it is about the patient. In 
Mandelkern’s private practice, though 
he is more active than a typical therapist 
might be, he usually doesn’t use the 
couch. He decided about ten years ago 
that having the patient on the couch was 
too impersonal for him, and he now sees 
patients sitting up. 
“I was suffering from a lack of 
interaction, a lack of contact,” he says.


It is a small example. Freud wrote in 
a paper called “Analysis Terminable and 
Interminable” that people never finish 
analysis, that they leave it and return 
to it in all their lives. No patient of 
psychoanalysis—and certainly no doctor 
of psychoanalysis—is ever “fixed” by, 
or finishes with, analysis. Most doctors 
feel their own psychoanalysis was the 
most important part of their training—
more important than the reading or the 
classes. Before they can be doctors, they 
must be patients.


At some point it becomes a 
technical question whether analysts are 
also undergoing analysis, because the 
way they think and feel about their lives 
is so informed by their fundamental 
quest to gain access to unconscious 
minds, including their own. To fully 
empathize with their patients, doctors 
must understand their own minds 
as deeply and as richly as possible, 
unconscious warts and all. They must 
be not only able to tolerate pain, anxiety, 
stress, despair, but also deeply willing to 
face it—in themselves and in others.


It’s a lonely profession. “You’re 
not hearing thousands of people at a 
time, and you’re not writing stuff that 
changes the lives of millions of people,” 
Mandelkern says. “You’re talking to one 
individual at a time, and you have to be 
willing to accept that.” Institutionalized 
professional interactions are necessary 
breaks from the day-in and day-out 
aloneness of a psychoanalyst’s office. 
Doctors don’t usually share ideas about 
their work with their patients, especially 
not psychoanalysts, and they need 
to gather occasionally with similarly 
minded shrinks to let it all out. Western 
New England has about forty members, 
a relatively tightly knit and socially 
agreeable group. Each doctor in the 
group knows most of the others, likes 
them, and gets along with the group.


When analysts get together, there 
is what Kirsten Dahl, the director 
of psychoanalysis for children and 
adolescents at Western New England, 
calls “a terrific social awkwardness.” 
“What is it about analysts?” asked a 
friend of Dahl’s who came with her to a 
conference. “All they do is walk around 
looking at the floor and talking about the 
weather.”


These analysts come to Western 
New 
England 
as 
full-fledged 
psychiatrists, psychologists, and clinical 
social workers before embarking on the 
process of becoming a psychoanalyst. 
The training necessarily takes place after 
all other training. It does not guarantee 
by any means a raise in income. The 
process is notoriously long and difficult. 
Dahl posed the question: Why in the world 
would anybody ever agree to do this? 
The 
short 
answer: 
analysis 
has affected them personally and 
intensely. Most go in primarily wanting 
psychoanalysis for themselves and, 
after years of talking about their own 
difficulties and sufferings for five hours 
a week, leave wanting to practice it for 
others. The necessarily painful, painfully 
necessary nature of psychoanalysis 
will generate intellectual interest in the 
field, not the other way around, Phillips 
said. For Mandelkern, personal and 
intellectual interest came together the 
day he recognized the blind spot he 
created for himself where his address 
book sat on his desk.


Self-discovery 
at 
core of Mandelkern’s journey into 
psychoanalysis, and it is at the core of 
psychoanalysis itself. Patients are urged 
to talk about things they are likely to 
discuss with no one else, to give their 
analysts privileged access to their 
minds. Above all, though, it is their own 
unconscious to which analysts seek a 
special kind of access. As Phillips puts it, 
every interpretation that an analyst makes 
begins with self-analysis.
