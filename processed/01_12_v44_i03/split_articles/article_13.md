Feeding Occupy 
New Haven
A string of multi-colored Christmas 
lights and the blue-green glow of 
sunlight filtered through tarp illuminate 
the food tent at Occupy New Haven. 
Several cardboard signs bluntly demand 
that occupants clean up after themselves. 
The food tent is known more officially 
as the Food/Library Tent. Half is for 
food, and half is called the lounge, 
according to demonstrator Jim Ferrara, 
a construction worker by day. “This 
is us basically,” he said, waving a hand 
at four mismatched chairs, a makeshift 
bookcase crammed with paperbacks, 
a bulletin board marred with memos, 
a battered bass drum, and a generous 
bouquet of fresh red roses.


On an unusually temperate 
November day,  protesters ranged 
outside, some preparing the tents 
for anticipated rain. Between sixty 
and eighty-five people sleep here 
regularly, depending on whom you 
ask, but many more gather for General 
Assembly planning meetings on Sunday 
afternoons. Demonstrators assemble 
not only to articulate their movement’s 
objections—to the roles of major banks 
and corporations in the democratic 
process and in the current recession—
but also to govern this new, tiny, self-
contained and well-regulated city on the 
New Haven Green. At the heart of this 
operation stands the food tent.
“We were going to have set meal 
times, but it’s too hard to get someone to 
cook,” Ferrara told me. The protesters 
rely instead on frequent spontaneous 
acts 
of 
cooperation. 
Early-rising 
protesters often make pots of oatmeal 
for the group. Some prepare vegan 
soups to be eaten communally after 
returning to the encampment from a day 
of work. Veganism and vegetarianism 
are common here, though perhaps not 
as rampant as at other Occupy protests. 
Dakota Ellingsworth, a physics student 
on a leave of absence from Carnegie 
Mellon, eats meat and was pleased to 
discover that Occupy New Haven also 
caters to the occasional omnivore. He 
arrived here after some time at Occupy 
Pittsburgh, where the meals were hot 
and regular but contained no meat. 
Ellingsworth admires New Haven’s 
protest. “They’re a good bit more 
organized than Pittsburgh,” he mused as 
he gazed upon the Food/Library Tent. 
While Occupy Pittsburgh is a larger 
protest, it’s squeezed into a tiny corner 
of downtown, not sprawled comfortably 
over a grassy expanse. Richard Riley, a 
handyman who had been here since 
three days after Occupy New Haven 

Bread, peanut butter, grape jelly, 
muffins, paper plates, napkins, and three 
pump bottles of Purell hand sanitizer 
were laid out at lunchtime that day. “I 
only want half a muffin,” Riley said, using 
a pocketknife to slice a fat blueberry one. 
He grabbed a cruller from a cardboard 
box of sticky donuts and a paper towel 
and stooped to exit the tent into the sun.
A steady stream of donations to the 
tent shows that the demonstrators enjoy 
support from the community more 
broadly. The sleek Occupy New Haven 
Web site provides a streamlined conduit 
for donations to feed the protesters. 
Specific needs—canned goods, tarps, 
socks, bug spray—are listed there 
like demands for a new world order. 
Mediterranea Café on Orange Street 
took after New York restaurants in 
offering a special vegetarian “Occu-
pie,” which sympathizers could pay to 
have delivered in bulk to protesters. Est 
Est Est and other pizzerias have also 
donated pies. 
	
 “We get it together,” Ferrara 
said. “Everybody pitches in.”
Book Trader donates bread to 
the protest. Atticus donates bread by 
default, to occupiers who requisition 
the bags of day-old baguette the store 
dumps on Chapel Street. Currently, 
the protesters have a surplus of bread. 
Ferrara worried aloud that their other 
supplies were getting low, though it 
certainly didn’t look that way to me. A 
cadre of bookcases contained canned 
vegetables and beans and pasta—and 
confectioner’s sugar, instant coffee, an 
economy-sized bottle of Vitamin C. A 
crate of pears, apples, carrots, and red 
potatoes rested on a makeshift bench. 
The potato peelings were destined for a 
special bin nearby. Occupy New Haven, 
like other Occupy protests, composts. 
	
The occupiers don’t have a refrigerator, 
but they do have a camping stove for 
cooking, a five-gallon water cooler that 
could have been borrowed from an office 
break room, and a fire extinguisher close 
at hand. Smoking is prohibited inside the 
food tent. Matt Smith, a construction 
worker with tattoos encircling his left 
bicep, chastised and chased away another 
occupier with a lit cigarette. Smith has 
spent every night on the Green for the 
past week and a half and hopes everyone 
will stay into the spring. “Hopefully 
through the winter, at least.”
	
Riley was also thinking ahead to the 
first frost. When I met him, he had 
just finished raking leaves. He said his 
freelance repair work usually slows 
down in the winter. “So I’ll be able to 
concentrate, make this my job, help 
people winterize their tents.” A few 
days later, demonstrators would line the 
food tent with insulating foamboard 
and lay linoleum to keep it clean. They 
plan to install a solar-powered heater. 
The Occupy movement’s long-term 
demands may be idealistic, but the 
immediate goals of this village are clear 
and sensible. Prepare the tents for rain 
or snow. Cook a pot of soup and clean 
up the mess. Wait.
