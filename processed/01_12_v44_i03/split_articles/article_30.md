Playing Hardball
At 13, Jericho Scott is happy to be a has-been national baseball sensation.
By Ben Mueller
Three years later, the remnants 
of Jericho Scott’s brush with 
youth baseball superstardom 
hang proudly in his small bedroom. A 
signed shirt from television personality 
Jimmy Kimmel is stuck to the wall 
next to Jericho’s own FatHead, a 
brand of oversized wall sticker usually 
emblazoned with the likenesses of major 
league all-stars, not scrawny nine-year-
olds pitching for youth teams sponsored 
by pizza parlors. His limbs flailing and 
his face scrunched into a ball of childish 
               PROFILE
effort, the Jericho whom the sticker 
depicts hurls one of the famed fastballs 
that got him kicked out of his league and 
into the national media spotlight. Today, 
Jericho cringes a bit at the image. “I don’t 
like how I look in that one,” he says.

On August 20, 2008, Jericho, now 
13, took the mound at Criscuolo Park on 
Chapel Street for then-undefeated Will 
Power Fitness, a team in the Liga Juvenil 
de Baseball, the small summer league he’d 
joined mid-season. The L.J.B. warned 
that Jericho, an above-average pitcher 
in this new league who was still only the 
third-best pitcher on his spring PONY 
League team, threw too hard and needed 
to change positions or move into an 
older age group. Jericho’s coach and 
parents ignored the warning and sent 
him out to pitch. After league officials 
promptly declared the game a forfeit 
and Jericho broke down in tears on the 
mound, editorials from New Haven to 
Idaho argued that the young boy was 
punished simply for being too good.
