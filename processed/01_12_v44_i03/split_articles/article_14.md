Built to Last
Zachary Rotholz ’11, the 22-year-
old who opened a cardboard furniture 
store on York Street this September, is 
getting tired of explaining his work to 
customers. He maintains a friendly and 
enthusiastic attitude. Yet when he’s asked 
for what feels like the millionth time, “Is

fatigue and boredom in his response:

Rotholz explains that he has to sell 
his products twice. First, he must sell 
the concept of Chairigami. Only after 
that can he sell the furniture itself. He 
has also come to realize that he himself 
is as much on display as is any piece of 
furniture in the room. Visitors hit him 
with all the frequently asked questions. 
Why did you decide on cardboard? How 
do you come up with your designs? 
Sometimes, the questions are personal. A 
Yale student on assignment for a writing 
class asked him about his love life. 
At first, Rotholz appreciated the 
attention. “It was nice being called 
‘the Chairigami Guy,’ ” he said. “But 
sometimes, I want to talk about 
something other than cardboard…”
