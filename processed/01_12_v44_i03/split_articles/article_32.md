of buried fiber optic cables shooting 
binary signals down the trail at the speed 
of light. Pedaling along the Canal Trail 
today, you retrace a history of relentless 
progress, of enterprising, single-minded, 
perpetually modernizing Americans—
the same “practical men” Ralph Waldo 
Emerson critiqued witheringly in his 
essay “The American Scholar.” They 
may not have been great literary or 
intellectual minds, but they reached into 
the future with undeniable skill and drew 
it toward them with panache. Tracing 
tracks laid by calloused hands and 
trenches dug on cold November days, I 
feel closer to these men.


Along the trail north of Hamden, 
the colonnades of trees have shed the 
last of their autumn leaves. I’m making 
worse time than I would like—debris 
from a recent storm litters the trail. The 
trees stand barren and naked, waiting 
patiently for winter coats of powdery 
snow. A few hold out, but their rusty, 
dark foliage droops from their branches. 
A “No Skinny Dipping!” sign that’s 
outlived its seasonal relevance marks 
a pond on the right. Runners, somber 
elderly couples, and strollers punctuate 
the path. Proper cycling etiquette 
requires a clear “On your left!” when 
passing others, but it seems mostly 
to startle. I go slowly past a gaggle of 
toddlers on the grassy shoulder, but 
despite my passing distance Mom is 
frightened. 


The Rails-to-Trails project that 
began converting the abandoned rail 
line to a multi-use path two decades ago 
has made slow progress, meaning the 
trail abruptly ends in places. Of course, 
Google Maps hasn’t gotten the memo. 
At one point in Cheshire the asphalt 
dissolves, and following my GPS, I take 
a dirt-access road that leads me across a 
nursery stock farm and through a cluster 
of greenhouses to the old rail line. The 
spikes have rusted through and the track 
is wildly overgrown in both directions. 
I stop to find my bearings. A pickup 
honks behind me. The driver is the one 
working on a Sunday, and I’m in the way.


Past Cheshire, the trail joins State 
Road 10. Time to open things up. There’s 
a slight tailwind, promising speed, and 
the bike settles into its rhythm. Not to 
disparage BMX or the mountain bikers 
of the world, but, in my opinion, the 
bicycle’s true home lies on the asphalt. 
Most simply, a bicycle is a tool for 
efficiently converting effort into motion. 
It converts work into velocity through 
a scheme of silently spinning gears, 
methodically turning pedals, and the 
gyroscopic equilibrium of the wheels. 
We move about the ground but above it. 
The experience demands power 
and control, mediated by clip-in pedals 
that make the machine an extension of 
the body. A bicycle beckons us toward 
the ideal of souplesse, or “smoothness,” 
a quality of ease and calmness in every 
action: whether holding a line shoulder-
to-shoulder in a tight pack, tracing 
the quickest arc through a corner, or 
launching the decisive attack when 
the road points skyward. Time on a 
bicycle, moreover, is a profoundly 
solitary experience. While we ride 
together and frequently cheat the wind 
with one another, each ride creates an 
irreducibly personal event. Each rider 
and bicycle form a whole, and a ride’s 
private sounds—the crisp whistle of the 
wind, the soft thrum of the tires—are 
engrossing against the silence of a well-
oiled chain.  


Three hours after I hit the trail, 
Simsbury’s main drag gradually emerges 
from the strip malls, fast food joints, and 
auto-repair shops along the highway. I’m 
almost there, and I’m struggling to think 
of conversation topics. My call the day 
before had been strained. While we had 
previously corresponded by e-mail about 
my “road trip,” I had put them on notice 
at the absolute last moment. “Hi, Aunt 
Amy? It’s Nick. Geiser, your nephew. 
Listen, I’m going to be riding the Canal 
trail tomorrow and I, uh, wondered if I 
could stop by? To see you and Mark?…” 
She drove to the point far more quickly: 
stop by any time, we’ll be out in the yard. 
Lily, their golden retriever, charges 
out of the garage to greet me. My San 
Francisco home was too small for a dog 
and a bite from an aggressive poodle 
colored my childhood opinion of 
them, but Lily was the one wonderful 
exception. I find my uncle Mark 
dispatching a fallen tree with a chainsaw 
on the edge of the property. His 
weathered, creased face greets me with 
a bemused “Howdy, Lance!” I manage 
a sheepish grin. I follow him back to 
the house, stepping gingerly to avoid 
muddying my Yale Cycling shoe covers. 
Amy relaxes in the living room watching 
the University of Connecticut women’s 
basketball team dispatch a far lesser 
squad. I try for the usual conversational 
topics about work and school, but find 
myself talking instead about the Canal 
trail, weather, and whether I can make 
it to the Massachusetts border before 
nightfall.


The visit drags on for an hour. My 
cleats noisily clomp about the house, 
and Lily is climbing all over me, mixing 
her muddy paw prints with the blue paw 
print pattern on my Yale kit. It’s time for 
me to go. 


After some hurried goodbyes, I’m 
back on the bike. It’s twilight already. 
There’s no way I’ll make it to the border 
before dark. The chill has set in and 
wind’s in my face now, pushing my pace 
down considerably. I’d overestimated 
the amount of time it would take me to 
get this far. If I want to make it back to 
school at a reasonable hour, I had better 
turn around now. 


On the journey back, I pedal 
through towns’ empty Sunday evening 
roads, with only the dull glow of neon 
signs and the occasional passing car to 
break the monotony of the trail. The 
visit with my relatives could have gone 
better, I could have made it farther 
north in a milder season, but I’m not 
too disappointed. The ribbon of asphalt 
before me dissolves into the darkness 
ahead. My wheels thrum. On the bicycle, 
things are in-between. Where I’ve come 
from, where I’m headed at that moment 
are irrelevant—I’m moving.
