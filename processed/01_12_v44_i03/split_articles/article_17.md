crowded with tombstones and overrun 
with weeds. “It is not for ye health that 
ye burying place should be where it is,” 
declared Governor Francis Newman in 
May 1659. He died a year later and was 
buried beneath the Green’s marketplace. 
A rickety red fence was constructed 
in the late eighteenth century to improve 
the overgrown plot’s appearance and keep 
out chickens and hogs, but the bodies of 
New Haven’s citizens continued to be 
piled together indiscriminately beneath 
the soil. An attempt to build a new 
monument for John Dixwell in 1849 
behind Center Church unearthed the 
remains of sixteen people in a twelve-
foot space just two feet below the surface. 
(John Dixwell, one of the judges who 
tried King Charles I of England, fled 
England for the safety of New Haven 
after condemning the monarch to death. 
Dixwell’s original 1689 monument is still 
visible behind Center Church.)
James Hillhouse, Yale’s treasurer 
for fifty years and a vocal anti-slavery 
leader, finally proposed a solution to the 
overcrowding below ground in 1796, 
after two pestilential years. In those days, 
midnight burials, which had become 
popular in sixteenth-century England, 
were still common. Neighbors living on 
the Green sometimes woke to the light 
of torches and the murmur of the burial 
service—perhaps accompanied by the 
smell of rum and hard liquor, which 
mourners traditionally drank at funerals.
Hillhouse purchased six acres on 
Grove Street, then on the outskirts of 
the burgeoning city, and argued for “a 
new burial ground, …better calculated 
to impress the mind with a solemnity 
becoming the repository of the dead.” 
Grove Street Cemetery was established, 
and burials on the Green became less 
frequent. The last person to be laid to 
rest there in 1812 was a Mrs. Martha 
Whittlesey. 
Today, if you wander into Grove 
Street Cemetery, the epitaph of a priest 
or blacksmith from the eighteenth 
century 
may 
greet 
you—but 
dig 
beneath the weathered gravestone, and 
you likely will not find bodily remains. 
The appearance of the burial ground 
on the Green was so neglected that in 
1820, a committee recommended that 
the city pay for the relocation of the 
gravestones to the new burying ground. 
The bones of the Green’s inhabitants 
were not disinterred, but left instead to 
rot namelessly where they lay. Bellantoni 
explained it was not uncommon to move 
the gravestones and not the bodies in 
Puritan New England. “Mortal remains 
were not worth much—many times you 
did not even have a graveside cemetery,” 
he said. “Your eternal soul, not mortal 
remains, was what was important.” 
But if you didn’t believe that the 
spirits of all good Puritans went to 
heaven, it was easy to feel spooked 
walking with the full moon shining 
through the elms. Some New Haven 
residents, now long dead themselves, 
testified that they encountered ghosts. 
In 1814, Yale University president 
Timothy Dwight published the story 
of the sixteen-year-old blacksmith who 
claimed to have followed one back to his 
grave. An account from the end of the 
nineteenth century describes a group of 
intoxicated Yale students who decided 
to wander across the green at midnight. 
They called out, “Arise ye dead and 
come to judgment!” As the story goes, 
a white figure rose and rushed towards 
them, crying, “Yes, Lord, I’m coming!” 
Today, though, the colonists’ souls 
seem to abide peacefully below ground. 
Perhaps they’ve all already gone to their 
Lord, or perhaps they’re in another place, 
one even deeper than the dirt below the 
Green.
