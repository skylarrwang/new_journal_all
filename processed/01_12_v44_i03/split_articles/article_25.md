more hours to have more money to buy 
more things. To this end, Waschall has 
already left his job as an accountant to 
focus on SHARE Haven and ARC, and 
Richo works only part-time as a librarian 
at Yale University.


When I first met King, I was skeptical 
of his sweeping claims about money, but 
I admired his conviction and his decision 
to test his vision in a neighborhood 
plagued by unemployment and crime. At 
Yale, students are told over and over that 
their youthful, hardheaded 
optimism is enough in itself 
to effect positive change. 
I’ve heard this from Teach 
For America recruiters, from 
Reach 
Out 
coordinators 
who plan service trips in the 
developing world, and from 
others who have a stake in 
the truth of the claim. Each 
time, I’m frustrated by the 
arrogance of the idea, but tempted by its 
hopefulness all the same. What if King, 
who so clearly believes in everything he 
is preaching, could prove it right?


King’s house, an unremarkable 
duplex with peeling paint, looks like 
any other on Atwater Street from the 
outside, but inside it is freshly painted 
and carpeted, tidy and warm with a bay 
window. Gesturing to the street outside 
the window, King and Waschall told 
me they imagine the neighborhood as 
a desert island. “If we all landed on an 
island, and we’re all skilled and there 
are some resources there but we have 
no money in our pockets, would we sit 
around saying ‘We have no money, so we 
can’t work with each other?’ ” Waschall 
asks. “No, we’re going to create a 
system and we’re going to start working 
together.” He said people on Atwater 
Street who are unemployed and have no 
money feel as if they can’t do anything 
to improve their circumstances. If they 
could take money out of the equation, 
they could see their own potential and 
that of their surroundings.  


K
ing didn’t move to Atwater to 
make a statement. He didn’t think 
much about the neighborhood at all. 
He just chose a place where he could 
buy an affordable house—his monthly 
mortgage payments on his two properties 
come to a total of $2,500—and now 
that he’s here, he’ll work with whoever 
is interested. He started this summer, 
holding a festival for local children and 
planting trees up and down the street 
with the help of the Urban Resources 
Initiative, a partner of the Yale School 
of Forestry and Environmental Studies. 
Longtime community organizers 
have welcomed King.  Lee Cruz, who 
lives and works in the same neighborhood 
as King and is the community outreach 
director of the nonprofit Community 
Foundation for Greater New Haven, is 
excited about ARC’s potential. He told 
me that, by putting time and energy into 
his house, King is helping everyone by 
contributing to the sense that Atwater 
Street is a good place to live, and by 
involving his neighbors in his projects, 
he is strengthening the local community.


The more time I spent with King, 
though, the more I wondered how 
much his presence was really helping 
his adopted community. King told me 
that the interactions between people on 
the street serve the role in his economic 
model that money does in most of 
America: they are the raw material with 
which everything is made. “Community 
is, again, everything and nothing,” he 
said. “Everything is going to come out 
of that—every content.” King earnestly 
believes that his ideas could help his new 
neighborhood, but the neighborhood is, 
first and foremost, the raw material for 
his vision.


Until recently, King lived in the East 
Rock area, which is heavily populated by 
Yale professors and graduate students. 
He said he likes that his new neighbors 
have more practical skills than his 
old ones, mentioning an out-of-work 
carpenter who might help Waschall 
renovate some of the ARC houses as an 
example.


“They have more resources in East 
Rock,” Waschall said when I asked if 
they ever considered starting a project 
like ARC there. He was sitting cross-
legged on an armchair with one of their 
two cats curled in his lap. “By resources, I 
mean they have the money 
to do things. So if, say, they 
wanted solar panels. Odds 
are they have more money 
in East Rock to do that.”


“I think here, we 
have more wealth. There, 
there’s more money,” King 
said confidently. “I mean, 
here, there are people who 
actually know how to do 
things and have time to do things. And 
it will actually mean something in their 
lives.” 


Though King is articulate and 
brimming with optimism, I came to 
think that he has a tendency to over-
simplify. His redefinition of “wealth” is 
one example. His statement that, since 
the economy is a construct, “nothing 
happened” during the Great Depression 
is another. His vision of the future is 
hyperbolic: he plans to be “off money” 
within a year, and predicts that the 
American dollar will have lost all value 
within five. 


King hasn’t tried to explain these 
far-reaching visions to his neighbors 
because he’s afraid of being seen as an 
authority figure and worried that the 
promise to “take people off money” 
could sound like a scam. His instincts 
about this are probably right, but I 
began to wonder if he could truly claim 
to include the Atwater Street residents 
in his project without doing them the 
courtesy of revealing his motives. I began 
to question whether, in a community 
so urgently in need of positive energy, 
King’s utopian fervor was quite the right 
kind. 
King plans to be “off money” 
within a year, and predicts that 
the American dollar will have 
lost all value within five.

living projects in New Haven, and they 
are interested in working with them once 
ARC is more firmly established. Several 
of ARC’s members had planned to buy 
houses in Green Haven before hearing 
about the new community on Atwater 
Street. 


Some New Haven residents have 
also grown interested in a new movement 
called Transition, which has influenced 
the members of ARC. Though not part 
of the cooperative housing movement, 
Transition embodies many of its values. 
Founded in the United Kingdom in 
2005 by Rob Hopkins, a professor of 
ecological design, it warns that fossil 
fuel depletion, climate change, and the 
failure of the world economy will soon 
render it impossible for humans to live 
the way we do. We should prepare for 
this inevitability, Transition proposes, by 
learning to live locally and rely on our 
neighbors so that our communities will 
be “resilient” when crisis strikes. 


Terry Halwes, a member of ARC 
who is in the process of renovating his 
new house on Atwater Street, has floated 
the idea of a New Haven Transition 
chapter. 


Though 
it 
never 
gained 
momentum, King said he hopes that 
Atwater will be a “Transition street.” 
When neighbors see the members of 
ARC raising their own food and sharing 
resources, they will want to join in, too, 
and when people from other parts of 
Fair Haven and New Haven see the 
principles of Transition succeeding, the 
ideas will spread.   


Transition 
lists 
racial 
and 
socioeconomic 
inclusiveness 
among 
its goals, but, predictably, it has been 
sprouting in towns where people bike to 
work and take their kids hiking on the 
weekends, where they’ve been preaching 
the social and ecological benefits of 
localization for years. There is already 
a registered initiative in the area of 
Western Massachusetts where I grew up, 
in a picturesque valley that 
is home to five colleges and 
universities, and that votes 
left on every issue.


W
hen I asked King if 
I could meet some 
of his neighbors, Dawn 
Chiaraluce and the couple 
Ken and Christine Voight 
were planning an errand to 
the pharmacy. It would be 
a good chance for me to 
talk to them, King said. Ken Voigt is the 
carpenter King hopes to recruit to help 
with many of ARC’s projects. Christine 
Voigt and her friend Chiaraluce have also 
been involved with ARC, volunteering to 
plant trees and helping out around King, 
Waschall, and Richo’s house, sometimes 
in exchange for cash. 


Chiaraluce came to pick me up at 
King’s house. She is middle-aged and 
looked tired and cold, with pale lips 
and circles under her eyes. When we 
reached the Voigts at the end of the 
block, I could tell that King’s request 
had inconvenienced his neighbors. “He’s 
rude,” Christine said in annoyance. “He’s 
in his own little mind.” Even wearing 
sweatpants and a sweatshirt with the 
hood up, she was attractive, with blond 
hair and a small, twinkling nose piercing. 
She lit a cigarette, hunching around the 
flame to protect it from the rain. Her 
voice was loud, with a smoker’s rasp.


They told me that King’s projects 
missed the point. “People need money,” 
they repeated over and over. Too 
many people in this neighborhood 
are struggling to keep up with their 
mortgages, they said, in danger of losing 
their homes. 


King’s attempts to barter also 
insulted them. Ken mentioned an article 
published about ARC in the New Haven 
Independent in July, which says that one 
T
he belief that people who approach 
life thoughtfully can figure out a 
better way to do things has always been a 
part of the American cultural landscape, 
but it is usually the purview of academics, 
intellectuals, and progressives. In 1843, 
Transcendentalist 
philosophers 
political reformers set a 
precedent for the communes 
of the 1960s. Charles Lane 
and Amos Bronson Alcott, 
whose daughter Louisa May 
Alcott penned the classic 
novel Little Women, founded 
Fruitlands, a small utopian 
commune where members 
attempted to grow their 
own food and raise their 
children collectively. King, a 
philosopher and academic, 
fits the mold.


King and his predecessors have in 
common not only the hope that it is 
possible to live by their ideals but also 
the freedom to try. They have education 
and resources to fall back on should 
their projects fail. Alcott struggled to 
make ends meet for most of his life, but 
his well-to-do family and friends were 
there to bail him out with loans when he 
could not feed his children. 


As in the past, communal living 
arrangements today appeal most to 
the young, the liberal, and the highly 
educated. In New Haven, the most 
active groups include a co-op house on 
Orange Street whose residents are all in 
their twenties and early thirties, around 
half enrolled in Yale graduate programs, 
and a small committee of older 
people who plan to build a cohousing 
community called Green Haven as soon 
as they purchase some land. The Green 
Haven group hopes that the houses in 
their neighborhood will cost around 
$250,000 each, with some smaller units 
possibly priced lower. The price of these 
homes—the buy-in to be part of Green 
Haven—is within reach for the members 
of the planning committee, most of 
whom are nearing or past retirement age 
in fields like nursing, book editing, and 
teaching. Waschall and King said they are 
aware of some of the other cooperative

of King’s neighbors mowed his lawn 
in exchange for a lunch of tofu and 
vegetables. Ken was that neighbor. He 
told me that he mowed the lawn as a 
favor to King and was offended by the 
idea that he did it for payment. “It makes 
it sound like I can’t feed myself,” he said. 
The blurred line between gift and 
transaction angered Christine as well. 
She told me she has given Chiaraluce 
financial assistance during a tough time 
“because she’s my friend, not the way he 
wants to do it.” The misunderstandings 
deflated me. King had violated an 
important social norm, but he had no 
idea.


Chiaraluce summed it up: “His 
heart is in the right place, but it’s never 
going to work.” 


Looking at the facts about Fair 
Haven, it’s hard to see King’s optimism 
as anything but irresponsible. In this 
part of the city, the median household 
income was recorded at $33,000 a year 
in the 2000 U.S. Census. According to 
the same census, the neighborhood’s 
residents are 42 percent Latino, and 
federal police raids in the neighborhood 
in 2007 found at least four households of 
undocumented immigrants. Fair Haven 
sees fairly routine prostitution and drug 
busts, and five women were arrested 
on prostitution charges in a sting this 
July. The area also suffers from violent 
crime. Eight of the fifty-five murders 
that have occurred in New Haven since 
the beginning of 2011 happened here, 
according to the New Haven Register. The 
challenges start young: New Haven’s 38 
percent public high school dropout rate 
means that many kids are wandering the 
streets by junior or senior year.  


In the pharmacy, it was clear that 
the Voigts and Chiaraluce needed to 
finish their errand and were tired of 
answering my questions. I watched a 
teenage African-American girl march up 
the aisle having an angry conversation on 
a cell phone, a child in a drenched parka 
trailing after her, while King’s neighbors 
wrote down their phone numbers and I 
apologized for catching them at a bad 
time. Back outside, the sky was dark gray, 
the houses sagged under the pelting rain, 
and the street was deserted. I biked back 
up Grand Street, away from Fair Haven 
and toward Yale, unable to escape the 
feeling that King’s optimism had nothing 
to offer, and neither did mine. 


H
ope is in short supply these 
days. Even among utopians, it 
seems to have dwindled. In fact, King 
told me that he doesn’t use the word 
“utopian” because it has become a 
pejorative 
associated 
with 
naïveté. 
Instead, contemporary cohousing and 
co-op residents use the milder phrase 
“intentional community.” They share 
a purpose, but they aren’t making any 
promises.


The 
utopian 
imagination 
is 
losing 
ground 
to 
the 
dystopian. 
Environmentalists shake their heads 
over inexplicable weather reports. The 
old bemoan the behavior of the young, 
who grow up with computers for 
playmates. The Transition movement 
thinks we can change for the better but 
says it can’t prevent the end of life as we 
know it.


My generation has grown up in this 
dystopian era. Like so many adults, King 
wanted me to explain why he sees so few 
young people involved in the movements 
that he thinks could save my generation 
from itself. “I’ve been very surprised, 
to tell you the truth, about younger 
people’s noninvolvement with this,” 
he told me. “It’s really disconcerting, 
actually. It seems like somehow they’ve 
become cynical but have also bought 
in.” He told me his students at Fairfield 
seem less apathetic than lost. While their 
professors still believe in the possibility 
of change, the young have no interest 
in revolution. “I don’t know what that’s 
about,” King said. “It’s probably a lot of 
fear. When I was growing up, there was a 
strong feeling that adults knew what they 
were doing. You don’t have that now.”


King is right, I think, that my 
generation is not so much apathetic as 
defeatist. We’ve seen over and over that 
it’s hard to opt out of the system, even 
if you see its flaws. In our eyes, even the 
most visionary movements have failed. 
Fruitlands shut down after seven months 
because its members hadn’t grown 
enough food to get through the winter. 
Dick Margulis, a member of Green 
Haven, told me about his experience 
living in communes, beginning in the 
1960s. “All of that works really well when 
you’re young and idealistic,” he said. 
“But human jealousies and arrangements 
creep into any arrangement that’s shared 
purse, and gradually, those situations 
tend to break down.”  


We’re well aware that if something 
hasn’t been fixed yet, it’s not because no 
one has tried. And if there’s one thing 
we’ve been taught, it’s that everything is 
connected, and when you tug on a string, 
you’re as likely to tighten the knot as to 
unravel it. 


King doesn’t deny that this mindset 
is rooted in reality. In fact, he expects 
that the economy, the environment, 
and the energy infrastructure will 
all collapse in the next decade. But 
he thinks these pressures, combined 
with the unprecedented fluidity of 
Internet communication, are creating 
a “consciousness shift” all over the 
world. He cited the Occupy Wall Street 
movement as a sign that people are 
starting to see the future differently. 
“I think we’re in a ten-year period of 
the biggest change that’s ever going 
to happen on this planet,” he told me, 
“and I really want to be a part of it.” 


King said he isn’t deterred by negative 
reactions from neighbors like the Voigts 
and Chiaraluce. He is planning to try 
to explain his ideas to them, but if 
that doesn’t work, their skepticism will 
become irrelevant when money as we 
know it ceases to exist. 


The end of the world is a classic 
part of the utopian vision. It clears the 
way so that humanity can start over and 
do things better this time around. Maybe 
I’m shortsighted, or maybe I’m just a 
pessimist, but I don’t think that all of 
our problems will be solved that easily. 
And if I’m right, then the residents of 
Atwater Street will continue to need 
money, not just for things they might 
be able to make themselves, but also 
for things they can’t, like mortgages and 
doctor’s bills. If people like the Voigts
