“It’s actually really great,” Lai said, 
getting up. “In some cultures, midwives 
actually breastfeed young babies, but 
when they’re done they usually still 
produce milk for a while. So what we 
do is have them harvest it, and we use 
that milk to make cheese.” A second 
of hushed silence passed. The women’s 
smiles started to drop. Bun went on, 
“Yeah, it’s really sustainable and socially 
conscious.” 

I froze, and my mind raced to make 
sure that I’d heard him right. Before 
I could even start to think through 
the potential ethical implications of 
serving person-cheese, Lai’s straight face 
collapsed. “Nah, I’m just fucking with 
you—it’s artichoke heart,” he laughed, 
breaking out into a broad grin. I learned 
quickly that Lai has a particular sort of 
deadpan humor, like comedian Zach 
Galifinakis if Galifinakis were an athletic 
Asian-American sushi pioneer.

Raised in New Haven, Lai is the 
son of a Cambridge-educated surgeon 
and a Japanese nutritionist. In 1982, his 
mother, Yoshiko Lai, opened Miya’s, 
named for her daughter, as New Haven’s 
first sushi restaurant. 

As Lai told me more about the 
restaurant’s history, I turned my attention 
to the miso soup and took another 
sip. Rich cubes of potatoes, buoyant 
mushrooms, and dark, silky seaweed 
balanced each mouthful of lightly salted 
broth. “I dove for that seaweed myself 
this weekend,” Lai said with noticeable 
pride. He harvests oysters and seaweed 
in one hundred acres of coastal water 
off the Thimble Islands in the Long 
Island Sound.

“Our kelp has more vitamin C than 
an orange and more protein than a steak,” 
he said. It was a brand-new recipe, and 
he was ordering each customer a bowl 
on the house. With each bowl, he’d say 
those exact words to the customer—I 
must have heard them at least a dozen 
times. 

Under Lai’s mother, Miya’s was 
a traditional sushi bar, serving classic 
dishes with standard sushi ingredients—
Bluefin tuna, shrimp, eel, sea urchin, and 
red snapper. When Lai took over, the 
dishes became more adventurous. 
Now, the majority of Miya’s 
offerings are vegetarian, in large part 
due to the comparatively low ecological 
impact 
of 
eating 
plants. 
Miya’s 
advertises, even boasts, that it serves “the 
Northeast’s only sustainable sushi” in its 
sprawling and self-indulgent menu—a 
fifty-five-page dissertation on food, the 
environment, and Miya’s culture, filled 
with the exotic names of Lai’s rolls: 
Kilgore Trout, Romping with the Goats, 
the Bad Tempered Geisha Boy. 

In my late teens, I became a 
vegetarian, but, like many others, 
I realized that I was actually pretty 
“You shouldn’t be 
able to walk into a 
sushi restaurant 
and ask them 
where their fish 
comes from, and 
get back an 
‘I don’t know.’ ”


O.K. with eating fish. Save for a few 
surprisingly bright creatures like octopi 
and squid, the marine animals we 
eat are generally about as sentient as 
rocks, plants, or, more charitably, bugs. 
Compared to beef, their associated 
greenhouse gas emissions are low. But 
eating fish still raises other ethical and 
environmental concerns. 

“I got interested in sustainability 
about eight years ago,” Lai told me, as he 
signaled to the servers to bring out a few 
dishes, “and shrimp was the one of the 
first things to go.” Shrimp accounts for 
only about two percent of the world’s 
seafood consumption, but nearly one-
third of the bycatch. This unwanted fish 
caught in the same nets as the shrimp is 
discarded back into the ocean, usually 
dead or dying. For some shrimp trawl 
fisheries, bycatch accounts for as much 
as 90 percent of a given yield.

Shrimp farming also can devastate 
local ecosystems. Ecuador, a coastal 
republic in South America, has had nearly 
half a million acres of coastal mangrove 
rainforests cleared in order to support an 
industry that exports 95 percent of its 
shrimp to the United States. “For us to 
serve cheap shrimp, future Ecuadorians 
won’t have the freedom to make a living 
off of their natural resources. It’s a 
social justice issue,” Bun explained, as 
his servers brought out a massive slab of 
rock with a half-dozen rolls on top. 

T
he Kanibaba 
Roll, 5 pieces, 
$25.75
The Kanibaba roll is soft-shelled 
crabmeat, wrapped in warm and savory 
potato, topped with lemon dill, a toasted 
Havarti cheese sauce, and a few strands 
of green onion. A handful of small, 
bright red crabs garnish the dish, as 
if climbing seaside rocks topped with 
seaweed. 

“This used to have shrimp in it, and 
it was our most popular dish,” Lai told 
me. I looked suspiciously at the crab on 
top. “That’s an Asian shore crab I caught 
myself,” he said. “Eat it last.” I scanned 
his face for signs that he was joking, and 
couldn’t find any. 

I decided to come back to the crab. 
I lifted it off the top and set it aside, then 
took a bite of the rich, cheesy potato 
roll. I felt as if I’d blacked out for a few 
seconds, then came to with a stupid 
grin on my face and an inexplicable 
craving for a cigarette. This wasn’t the 
type of roll you imagine when you hear 
“sustainable sushi.”

I took a look at the crab I set aside, 
and the bite I had left of my kanibaba. 
“Might as well,” I thought, as I placed 
the crab on top of the roll, and raised 
them both to my mouth with Miya’s 
sleek metal chopsticks. The shell and 
meat were brittle but delicious. 

Asian shore crabs migrated to this 
continent in the ballast of freighters

in the eighties, and have now taken 
up residence in beaches all along the 
Northeast coast. They’re a destructive 
invasive species. They eat the larvae 
and plankton on which local fish 
and shellfish subsist. With no natural 
predators to keep them in check, Asian 
shore crabs are quickly displacing native 
crab populations. Lai does his part by 
using them in his dishes. “I’ll have to 
take you out to catch them, sometime,” 
he told me.

Not long after my meal at Miya’s, 
Lai and I met up with a friend of his, 
Will Reynolds, as we made our way 
to Silver Sands Beach in Milford, 
Connecticut. Reynolds, a charismatic 
filmmaker who recently moved to New 
Haven, met Lai at Miya’s. “He took me 
under his wing,” Reynolds said. The two 
belted Das Racist’s “Combination Pizza 
Hut and Taco Bell” as we arrived. I’m at 
the Pizza Hut. We grabbed a large white 
bucket from the back of Bun’s car—I’m 
at the Taco Bell—and made our way to the 
craggy rocks on the cold, late-November 
sand. I’m at the combination Pizza Hut and 
Taco Bell. 

Lai’s method for hunting Asian 
shore crabs is simple. He turns over 
rocks on the beach, hoping he’ll find the 
crabs hiding underneath. We flipped over 
seven rocks without much luck, startling 
one or two crabs the size of quarters 
that tried to scuttle away. Lai, Reynolds, 
and I picked them up and threw them in 
the bucket. Soon we hit our stride.

“Look under rocks that are big, 
flat, and not too deep. They need room 
to get under there,” Lai said. We found 
one that looked good—it took both Lai 
and me to flip—and heard Reynolds 
shout in surprise. A mass of about two 
dozen writhing crabs scurried for cover 
or played dead. We laughed and grabbed 
them by the handful.

After about an hour our fingers 
were frozen, but we had a bucket full 
of crabs. It crackled like a bowl of Rice 
Krispies. “This will last us a while,” Bun 
laughed, as we made our way back to 
Miya’s, where the crabs would be boiled, 
seasoned, and served.


S
akura Sashimi, 5 
slices, $18.75	
Thin slices of light pink tilapia are 
treated with sea salt and lime and infused 
with beet pulp, staining the edges a deep 
purple. Inspired by Inuit tradition, Lai 
has frozen the slices of fish, curling up 
the edges. Five of the large slices are 
arranged on a plate in a circle, like the 
petals of a large flower. They taste as 
delicious as they look. The frozen fish 
melts in my mouth. 

More unexpectedly, the tilapia 
used in the dish is from the Bridgeport 
Regional 
Aquaculture 
Science 
and 
Technology 
Education 
Center, 
a 
vocational high school more than twenty 
miles from Miya’s. Deep within the 
expansive coastal campus, John Curtis, 
the school’s director, gave Lai and me 
a tour of the hatchery. Lai and Curtis 
laughed like old friends—Lai laughs 
with everyone like old friends—as I 
looked into the wide, white tanks that 
circled the room. Inside the tanks were 
gray fish the size of my calf, swimming 
in green and salty water. Students at the 
school hatch, raise, and sell the fish, 
working sustainably at every step. “I’ll 
buy anything these guys will sell me,” Lai 
says, laughing. 

To Lai, knowing where fish comes 
from is hugely important. “We used 
to get our seafood from a Japanese 
company and we had no idea where it 
came from. You shouldn’t be able to 
walk into a sushi restaurant and ask 
them where their fish comes from, and 
get back an ‘I don’t know.’ ” 

“There has to be traceability in 
seafood,” he said later. “I’d like to see 
a shift to treating fish and seafood a 
lot like wine: there should be policy 
enforcing origin.”

Ariana 
Bain, 
sustainability 
consultant and graduate of the Yale 
School of Forestry and Environmental 
Studies, helps Lai ensure supply lines 
are traceable. “Working with Bun is 
hilarious,” she said. “I’m a very sort of 
rational, logical person. I’m involved in 
the back-end operations because Bun 
knows it’s something he’s not really 
strong at.”

“Everything’s always fluid with Bun, 
because he’s an artist,” she told me.

K
iribati Sashimi, 
10 slices, 
$12.75
Lai’s activism stretches further than 
limiting his own ecological impact. He 
also strives to raise awareness about 
the damage unsound choices make to 
humans. A server brought out our last 
dish, Kiribati sashimi. A dozen or so 
thin, pink slices of fish were sprinkled 
with brown, red, and black spices and 
arranged like a large flower on the center 
of a small plate. The perimeter slices 
lay like petals, with a few pieces rolled 
tightly in the center, standing up and 
spiraling out like a rose bud. 

“Kiribati is an island nation in the 
Pacific Ocean only a dozen feet or so 
above sea level. Scientists estimate that 
it will be under water in the next fifty 
years,” Lai told me as I put a slice of the 
soft and salty meat on my tongue. The 
tangy salt used in the dish was imported 
from Kiribati, “their only natural 
resource,” Lai said. “We designed the 
spices to simultaneously warm and cool 
your palette. It’s a metaphor for climate 
change.”

Lai and I finished our drinks late 
in the evening, long after it grew dark 
and nearly four hours after I’d arrived. I 
stood up to thank Bun for his hospitality. 
He hugged me good-bye and said, “I’ll 
see you around, brother!” I left Miya’s 
with a stomach full of warm sake, cheap 
beer, and seafood that I had enjoyed with 
a clean conscience. As I was leaving, I 
looked back and saw the restaurant’s 
logo in the large window: “Because man 
cannot live on rice alone.” 

I smiled, knowing that at Miya’s, 
man didn’t have to.
