DISCOVERED OUR MUTUAL OBSESSION AT DINNER one night 
when I told Lisa that her new hairstyle inade her look like 
Fantasia, one of my favorites on .American Idol. Every week 
Lisa has a different hairstyle: sometimes it is cropped short in curls, 
other weeks it is parted down the middle with long extensions. That 
day her hair was slicked back in a shiny wave 
just like Fantasia's. 
. • 
Lisa would not have it; she thought Fantasia sounded like Macy 
. Gray, and she hated Macy Gray. "La Toya is going to win, hands 
•·:::..· down," Lisa said as she scooped a spoonful of curried chicken onto my 
dining hall tray. The long line of students behind me kept me from 
arguing with her 
we would have to settle it later. 

The familiar orchestral crescendo of the American Idol theme 
music fills my entryway every Tuesday night at 8 pm, calling friends 
and passers-by to my common room. My friends and I make the same 
mistake every week of bringing our textbooks to the couch, pretending 
that we can cram in some reading during the commercials. The howl-
ing, cheering, and random exclamations from our common room audi-
ence prevent any work from getting done; those who live nearby but 
choose not to indulge in the weekly pop culture ritual know to retreat 
to the library during Idols weekly slot. This week, however, I forewent 
-
. -
the sacred routine in order to catch a ride home with Lisa so I could 
watch the show with her. 

........ daughter of a retired fire fighter and a school teacher, Lisa 
Johnson was born in New Haven in 1961, the second of three sis-
ters. They belonged to Mount Zion Seventh Day Adventist 
Church, and her parents ran a very strict household. "On Friday, when 
the sun went down, we went down," she recalls~ 

The way she explained -it to me, the partying started as Lisa and 
her sisters got older. Following the lead of her older sister, Lisa fre-
quented the clubs of downtown New Haven, especially the trendy Blue 
Angel Cafe. She brags now that she was never carded because she 
always looked older. "Always." 

Though Lisa did well in high school 
"I graduated with 3 As and 
2 Bs" 
she decided to enroll in the SPACE program for students enter-
ing the workforce rather than college. She alternated between two 
weeks of school and two weeks of work as a salesperson at Macy's. "I 
was officially a floater, but I always ended up in the Men's department." 

ich, Zeus, and Carl all asked Lisa for rides home from the din-
ing hall tonight. The music in the car is blaring, so I can't quite 
the conversation. Zeus got a restraining order on his ex-
girlfriend Shanice. Rich convinced Zeus to buy a car that he couldn't 
afford at a police auction. Rich was screwing around with Shanice. 
Rich's wife lives in Brooklyn. And Carl is just laughing at both of them 
. the whole time. Lisa finally turns down the radio. 

"Oh .my god. Yesterday I saw that cop that pulled me over a few 
nights ago for running two lights. I pulled right over when I saw him. 
He was so. fine! He said, 'You got some time for me?' Damn straight I 
. 
got some time for you. I'll fucking make time. So I gave him my num-
b " 
er . 

The three guys laugh . 

Lisa pulls up to the curb, and the guys get out. She yells after them . 
"You got Barbershop, and you got Leprechaun 2, don't you? That's 
why I'm going to stop lending out my fucking movies. My memory is 
gone. I can't remember shit today from yesterday!" 

A few blocks later, we pull up at Lisa's house. There are no lamps 
on the street, so I can't really see the rest of the block. 

Inside, the living room seems out of proportion. The ceilings are 
low and slope downward. A big chunk of one of the fiberglass wall pan-
els is missing. An oversized couch and an enormous big-screen TV take 
up the majority of the living room 
"Yeah, it's a big fucking TV for a 
small fucking house!" 

Before I get to see much else, Lisa throws her purse on the floor, 
jumps on the couch, and turns on the television. I take a seat at the 
other end. In the few minutes we have before the show begins, Lisa 
half-jokingly mentions the allegations of racism being hurled at the 
show in light of Jennifer Hudson's recent defeat on the competition. 
But before I have time to weigh-in on the issue, Lisa excitedly begins to 
extol the virtues of "sister" La Toya. Though she gets angry when I 
begin to advocate for Fantasia, we both agree that "white-boy" John 
Stevens is really annoying, and we can't wait for him to get kicked off 
the show. Satisfied, Lisa turns up the volume in time for the first per-
formance of the evening. 

During the commercial break, Lisa goes to the upstairs bathroom, 
and I take a look around. The entire house is decorated in muted 
shades of cream, maroon, and gray. Along the wall behind the couch is 
a long mirror in the shape of the New York City skyline. Next to the 
enormous television are two huge speakers stacked on top of one 
another. Beside those are endless piles of DVDs 
bootlegs, Lisa 
explains later. A crooked lamp in the corner casts an awkward shadow 
on the house plants, three hanging and two potted. Along the top of 
the television are prom pictures in plastic frames painted in ... glitter. 

When the American Idol theme music comes back on, Lisa sprints 
back down stairs. She jumps on to the couch beside me in time to catch 
the next song. It is forbidden to talk during performances, so I wait for 
the next commercial break to ask more about her life. 

tevie Peters was "a bum." He lived in "one of those raggedy-ass 
apartments in the projects," where the "elevator didn't w.ork, the 
halls smelled like pee, and homeless were people sleeping in 
the halls." 


THE NEw JouRNAL

"I always said I wouldn't talk to people from the projects," 
Lisa tells me. "I was dead wrong." After graduating from 
Hillhouse, Lisa worked at Circuit Wire, an electronics manufac-
turer on the corner of Whaley and Orchard. Stevie used to hang 
around the store while Lisa was working. "We started dating," Lisa 
says with a schoolgirlish grin. 

Lisa moved in to Stevie's apartment after a few months; then 
she got pregnant. The baby, Angela, was always crying. When Lisa 
took her to the hospital, she discovered that Angela had a legation 
of the left coronary artery. 

"And that's when all the drugs and alcohol came in to my life. 
I thought it would take away all the pain. I was so stoned, I could-
n't feel nothing ... I needed something to shield me. She was my 
first child, and the doctors kept repeating that it was a live-or-die 
situation. That was a scary damn place to be at." 

In the meantime, Lisa became pregnant again and gave birth 
to Stevie Jr. Though Stevie and Lisa initially argued over where the 
babies would live after Angela recovered, Stevie was soon arrested 
for larceny and sent to jail. "He quit his job because he wasn't 
making enough money for drugs. So he started boosting 
that's 
what we call stealing," she explains. 

After living with her Grandma Ty for a short time:-
"she was a great babysitter" 
Lisa enlisted for welfare. 

Together with her two children, she got her own apart-
ment at 1440 Whaley Avenue. She stayed at home, 
"living off the state," taking care of her kids as they 
went to kindergarten. When the landlord sold 
Lisa's apartment, she moved in with her sister. 
By that time, Stevie had been released 
from prison, but within a week, he was sent 
right back for another larceny. When Lisa 
heard this, she vowed, "That was the 
end of his ass." But when arguments 
between Lisa and her sister's hus-
band forced Lisa to move out, 
Stevie was the only person she 
could turn to. 

Since being released 
from jail for the second 
time, Stevie had moved 
. . 
in with a new girl-
friend, Katrina, with 
whom 
he 
had 
another son, also 
named Stevie 
Jr. 
After a

brief stay with them, Lisa finally decided to register as homeless at the 
city office. 

After receiving emergency ninety-day housing at a hotel in Old 
Saybrook, Lisa qualified for the Rental Assistance Program (RAP) 
which helped her find an apartment. Two years later, she was able 
to move to a house on Winthrop Street. It was there that the self-
titled "New Haven Drug. Factory" was established. 

When some of Lisa's sister's friends came down from 
New York, she offered to put them up in her new house. 
Bringing small quantities of drugs with them, they start-
ed "a nice little business" along with Lisa. Within a few 
weeks, it turned in to "an all-night, 24-hour a day, 
non-stop drug factory. I would have never made 
that amount of mqney in a lifetime." 

At the same time, Lisa started dating a man 
named TJ; it was what Lisa describes as "the 
quickest relationship ever." She had seen 
him around New Haven. "New Haven is 
small, and you get to know everybody, 
especially from your age bracket." .LJ" 
soon became pregnant with TJ's 
baby, but two months after giving 
birth to their daughter Lauren, 
TJ died of cancer. "He was a 
good guy. Never drank, never 
did anything 
he could 
have been perfect." 

Meanwhile "the business got bigger and bigger." Pay-offs· to the 
police department gave them advance warning· of any raids, which 
became . more frequent as their operation grew. The high volume of 
police raids caused Lisa to lose her RAP enrollment, and in turn, her 
house. But by that point she had another boyfriend 
"The Asshole"-
with whom to move in. She continued her drug trade from a neigh-
bor's house, though she was pregnant again. 

It was almost two years after Quinn's birth when Lisa heard a 
knock on the door. Another .customer, Lisa assumed. She went into 
the bedroom to fetch her usual bags .. of weed and . coke. As she 
approached the front of the house, the door burst open and twelve 
policemen rushed in, surrounding her with cocked guns. She dropped 
the drugs and threw her hands up in the air. She recognized one of the 
cops; she thought he must have been there before, undercover. She 
knew it was over: "They had me." 

next time I go to Lisa's house, the radio is off and I sit in the 
front seat of the car. Carl is in the back talking about the "flat-ass 
hos" that Rich and Zeus took down to a club in Stamford last 
weekend. "No-ass-at-all," he explains. 

Since John Stevens wasn't kicked off American Idol last week, we 
had agreed to watch the show together again this Tuesday to relish 
what was sure to be his pending departure. 

As we drive through the campus, I point out a friend of mine 
walking on the sidewalk in front of us. She asks me his name. "Josh." 
A wide smile spreads across her face. 

"Call out his name when we pass him," I suggest. 

'Tm one step ahead of you," she says. She slows down next to · 
him, yells out his name, and waves. The confused look on his face 
throws her in to a fit of laughter as we speed down the street. 

Though Carl lives only three blocks away from Lisa, it takes us a 
good ten minutes to get home after we drop him off because of all the 
one-way streets. 

"You used to be able to zoom right down the street. But because 
of all the drive-bys and the drug busts, they changed up the streets, put 
in stop signs, traffic lights, dead-ends. Slow people down some." 

The sun is still out when we arrive, so I can see the house . better 
now. It looks like a lunchbox with a roof-
no porches, no balconies. 

It is all white, with four square windows. Two cars, both with deflated 
tires, sit in the driveway beside the house. A cat greets us at the tattered 
screen door. 

"Charlotte, I know you peed all over the rug. I can see it on your 
face." 

The house seems a lot bigger than I had remembered it. I take my 
usual seat at the end of the couch. 

ail was just like a dorm, like college," Lisa offers without a smile. 
"They even called them dorms over there." She had the key to her 
own room, and could wear her own clothes 
"six shirts, six pairs 
of pants, six of everything." Though sentenced to six years of prison, 
Lisa was released in just one to a Work Release program in Waterbury, 
Connecticut. She lived in a h01 1se run by Catholics and got a job doing 
housekeeping at the Marriott. Eight months later, she was on parole. 
"I didn'-r know nobody in Waterbury, which is the way I liked it, so I 
couldn't get in no trouble." She moved her kids there, except for 
Quinn, who stayed with her father. After they moved in with a co-
worker named Wayne, Lisa quit her job and-began "going out, staying 
24 
out late all night." When the money ran out, Lisa knew it was time to 
go back to· New Haven. 

After living with her sister for a month, Lisa moved in across the 
street frqm her parents. Lisa's father called in a favor from a childhoo[ 
friend who managed one of the dining halls at Yale. "I started i11 
September 1998, no application, no nothing." When Lisa's aunt did 
in 2000, she left an empty house in New Haven. Lisa moved right i11, 
and tha is where we were sitting today. 

i 
·n the next week, Lisa had a meeting with the Housing Authority. 
"I've been waidng nine years for them to call," she tells me during 
the commercial break. But she says she won't accept. "I just want to 
hear them offer it to me, and I want to be able to turn it down in their 
face," she cackles. Last week, she went with Carl to "scope out" all the 
public housing facilities that the Housing Authority works with, like 
the apartments on Grand Avenue and in West Hills. 

"They suck. Have you seen those projects? They're the ones with 
those guys hanging-around outside with their trunks open, blasting 
their music. I may live in the ghetto, but at least it's the quiet ghetto. 
And since its mostly old folks around here, I never have no problems.' 

But Lisa admits that all this talk of housing did convince her t~ 
look in to Yale's Homebuyers' program. "The ceilings in this place are 
too low. Everything is falling apart. With all the kids moving in and 
out and in and out, I need more rooms," she explains. "And I want t~ 
finally own my own place." 

The phone rings. It's Stevie Jr., or "Steve-o" as Lisa refers to him 
He works at Stop N' Shop down in Milford 
he's calling because 
just got off work. Lisa has been trying to convince him to apply for 
job with the fire department. "I was even going to pay the hundred 
dollar application fee for him," she tells me. "But he just smokes weed 
all day." 

Lisa excitedly reports that her oldest daughter Angela is applying 
to go to nursing school in Hamden. She is already a mother of two. 
"I told Angela not to have kids yet," Lisa says ruefully. "I guess she 
has bad luck with men, too. I see it already. She's going through the 
same bullshit I went through. I just hope they don't go down the same 
path I went down. I try to push them in the right direction." 

ohn Stevens finally gets voted off the show that night. When hi! 
name is announced, Lisa and I begin to clap excitedly in unison. AJ 
the commercials start, we give each other a familiar look 
and laugh. 

Some names and locations have been changed.
