class seem to run parallel. In my freshmen 
suite of six, I represented one of two of the 
public high school graduates; the rest had 
attended prestigious and costly private 
schools like Phillips Andover and Horace 
Mann. An Arizona native in my class pointed 
out that there were more students in the class 
of 2007 from the Los Angeles private school 
Harvard-Westlake than there were from the 
entire state of Arizona. 

insularity of university education is 
part of a larger story about a closed cul-
ture. Many students at Yale come from 
• 
· homogenous upper-middle class communi-
ties in which parents drive Volvos and listen 
to National Public Radio. In high school, stu-
dents attend posh summer programs where 
they appropriate culture and pad their Yale 
application by traveling to underdeveloped 
Southeast Asian countries for a few weeks 
before heading to Europe for the rest of 
break. For many students, coming to Yale is a 
natural continuation of a privileged life. 
Surrounded by the fragrant summer blossoms 
on the Cross Campus green, eating delicious 
organic foodin the Berkeley dining hall, there 
is an underlying assumption that this is nor-
mal, as if all people walk barefoot on luscious 
grass, or listen to John Kerry pontificating-
twenty feet away. 

I too glide easily into this Yale narrative 
of privilege. Many of these anecdotes tell part 
of my story. When I was fifteen I traveled to 
Thailand for four thousand dollars to engage 
in a "cultural exchange program," which 
amounted to absorbing whatever culture fil-
tered through the plexiglass windows of our 
air-conditioned van. My parents both drive 
Volvos and listen to National Public Radio. 
I've been to Europe on family vacations. My 
father buys organic chicken. But I also devi-
ate from the norm: my father is black, my 
mother is white and Jewish, and they have 
both taught me to seek out a world beyond 
my own. 

The bourgeois bohemian lifestyle that 
defines "life" at Yale is not what all ofYale has 
experienced, however. It is certainly not what 
all .Cultural Connections participants have 
SEPTEMBER 2004 
experienced. Their diversity coupled with a 
strong sense of community makes CC an 
important program 
especially in contrast to 
the more typical Yale experience. Cultural 
Connections challenges the concept of the 
"normal" 
Yalie 
who 
frequents 
Urban 
Outfitter's and lands her summer internship 
at CNN because of her mother's friend. 

n contrast, for the five days of CC, multi-
culturalism is the normative narrative on 
Old Campus. A Chinese-American fresh-
man recounts a conversation that transpired 
during Cultural Connections the night 
before. "We were all sitting in Lanman-
Wright courtyard,'' she explained. ''And it 
turned out that one girl's mother cooked lob-
ster the same way my mom did with the 
entire lobster whole, eyes open and every-
thing and she was Latina. And then this 
other girl came over, and she was Korean, and 
she was telling us how her parents cooked. 
And it was kind of nice 
us all talking about 
how our parents cooked, even though we had 
different backgrounds.'' Later in the week I 
got to know two other CC participants, both 
Chicana, from poorer parts of Los Angeles, 
who attended public schools where students 
of color are a majority. " I went to a school 
that was not like a lot of what Yale is," 
Cinthia told me as 
we lounged on 
Hammonasset beach. "No one really took 
school seriously, everyone was sleeping -all the 
time, no one really cared." It is a testament to 
Yale, or at least CC, that Cinthia blended eas-
ily for those five days into the CC family, and · 
felt comfortable on a campus where women 
and minorities were once few and far 
between. 

. 
I spent a long time talking to Celeste, 
another CC participant. She is a lanky, 
spunky, earnest girl from the Boston suburbs 
with a background is much like my own-
she grew up twenty minutes from my home-
town. . "It was hard because it was mostly 
white, and I was the only black girl in most of 
my classes. And most of the black kids con-
sidered me white, and I always said, "No, I'm 
black,"" she explained. She continued, more 
optimistically. "But it's really great to come 
here and be around so many minorities who 
care about learning. I've never stayed up all 
night talking with so many minorhies about 
all these different things, and not felt like a 
loser or felt white." 

sometimes worry that the CC freshmen-
these brave, vulnerable kids 
will feel the 
isolation that I felt, and sometimes still feel, 
because I don't relate to clubby Yale, Yale of 
·creamy white skin, pearl earrings, and private 
schools; Cinthia asked me one night during 
CC, "Is this what all ofYale is like?" I didn't 
know what to tell her, because most of Yale is 
not like Cultural Connections. "People will 
be nice, you have to put yourself out there, 
look beyond the surfaces," I told her, glossing . 
over Yale's gaping problems in an attempt to 
allay her fears. But I think, as simplistic as my 
answer was~ it rings true. Yale is not only its 
surface. It is ·not only a place where the 
Bushes and the Beineckes are educated, but 
also a place where a queer Chinese-American 
girl can wear a provocative t-shirt, where 
Cinthia can feel at home, and where honest 
conversations can abound.
