**Move-In Day and Other Italian Adventures**

ove-in day always makes me nostalgic. I remember how I felt 
when 1 first passed through the blue pearly gates of Yale 
University. The mystifying sensation of walking into 
Commons, thinking, "Where am I? And how did I find myself a part 
of this 300-year-old brain club," is one I won't soon forget. When I 
decided to go abroad, I felt a similar sense of bafflement, but 
without the tacit reassurance that I had been admitted. 


I took the semester off to go to Italy and found · 
myself in an equally foreign place, coping with a 
humbling cerebral downgrade. 


Part of the problem was that when I 
absconded from New Haven, it hadn't 
occurred to me that I might want to study 
Italian before arriving on Italian soil. 
(.Though even if I had, I think Italy still 
• 'Yould have gotten the best of me.) 


Instead, I would go to the bakery and 
walk out with six loaves of wheat bread 
when all I wanted was a muffin. I went to 
the pharmacy for decongestants and left · · 
with skin-lightening creams. My graver 
pronunctatton errors were even more mstructtve. 
When I thought I was exalting a half pound of prosciutto crudo, a 
bunch of bananas, or a phone card from the local tobacco store as per-
fetto, I learned I had been saying something slightly different. Instead 
of telling the local shopkeepers that their products were perfect, I was 
telling everyone in my God-fearing town, from small children to old 
ladies, that each one was himself perfetto. 


As my lingual slips pushed me closer and closer to the fringe of soci-
ety, I began to do all I could to fade into the mosaic. It wasn't that I 
couldn't speak Italian (although I couldn't); it was that I was deeply 
afraid that someone might know I couldn't speak Italian. Even the deaf-
mute persona was preferable 
which is why the bus ride from -my 
home to my job was usually the most angst-ridden 17 minutes of my 
day. There were a few tricks that I learned to avoid parlay-ance. First, 
s~cure the single seat up front, at all costs. Second, ~ways harbor head-
phones in case it looks like someone may want to talk; and third, the 
last resort, pretend to sleep if someone does ask a question. I practiced 
these measures religiously until I met Filippo. 


. 
He was exactly my age. He was slim and neat and there was some-
thing intense about him. I first saw him my second day on the bus. I 
remember thinking that it was surprising to find my husband-to-be so 
quickly 
but I knew we would be good together. Our friendship pro-
gressed slowly: I was terrified of ruining the fantasy I had created about 
him, and so I stifled coughs, swallowed sneezes, and avoided anything 
else that may have provoked conversation. Then one day he asked me 
my name. And despite the fact that I barely knew how to answer, he 
kept at it. Strangely, . he seemed to only be marginally upset that I 
understood· only a fraction of his loud, slow, Italian monologues. We 
sat next to each other every day, and he spoke to me with infinite 
patience as my Italian slowly improved.

It was difficult for me to speak to him, not 
least of all because our conversations were 
far from private. The other passengers 
seemed acutely aware of our interac-
tion 
and they were impossible to escape. 
The same old women boarded everyday, 
always traveling in packs, never paying, 
and frequently casting us quizzical looks. 
The smoker with the old-w<?rld teeth, who got 
on near the Eurospin and exchanged a kiss with 
the old man up front, raised her eyebrow when 
she passed us. The high school girl seemed more 
disturbed by our conversation than by the com-
ments from a man at the front, which seemed 
to me at least tonally lewd. 


Filippo and I spoke daily for weeks. I learned 
that his favorite book is Harry Potter (which is also his 
favorite movie); he likes to make lasagne a! forno; he enjoys eating 
Neapolitan Pie, and he loves taking pictures. He learned that my 
favorite book is Portrait of a Lady, I like to make quiche, eat gelato and 
go fishing. He was my first real friend in Italy, and I frequently wrote 
letters home describing what our children might look like. 


But despite the Italian lessons, my obliviousness had not quite dis-
appeared. The first time I saw Filippo outside the bus, he was wander-
ing around the playground in town. He was wearing his pants very 
high. He had a multi-colored fanny pack slung sloppily around his 
waist. His arms were clenched at his sides. Suddenly, the curious stares 
I had received from the other passengers on the bus started to make 
more sense. His gymnastics class; his penchant for close talking 
per-
haps these were not just cultural differences, as I had assumed. I real-
ized that he was mentally handicapped. 


.... 
Filippo saw me, waved and asked me what I was up to. "Avevo-io 
fotto andondo per una passeggiatta," I answered. "I have had done going 
for a walk."
