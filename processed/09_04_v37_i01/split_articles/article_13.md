UST OFF HIGHWAY 293 IN MANCHESTER, 
New Hampshire, Abi Vladeck and three 
other Yale students .pulled into a Sunoco 
. 'sta-
tion and asked the attendant to put 
twenty dollars on the meter. As Abi pumped, 
'·the attendant leaned against the station's wall 
· and told Abi casually, "You know,. Hess has 
··. cheaper gas. I shouldn't tell you that, but gas 
IS so expensive. 

Abi thanked her, and the attendent con-
tinued talking, complaining about the bad 
·economy, the Bush administration and her 
general discontent with the state of the coun-
try. 

As Abi finished pumping her gas, she 
·asked the girl, "Are you registered to vote?" 
When the attendant answered no, Abi 
·sprung into action. She called for pink sheets 
and yellow sheets, hurling information at the 
surprised girl about when, where and how to 
register, asking her to sign a card pledging to · 
· 'vote in the next election, and telling her that 
only by voting could she make her opinions 
count. Abi and her companions drove away 
satisfied. When they told me the story later, 
·they called it a .. drive-by canvassing:·


bi, Emily Friedrichs, Jared Malsin, 
Alison Duffy, and I were spending the 
in New Hampshire registering 
people whose votes we hoped would be cru-
cial in the corning election. Abi, who gradu-
ated in May with a degree in Literaque, led 
our team. Emily and Jared, both New 
Hampshire natives, were also political veter-
ans, who dedicate much of their time to 
teaching, writing and working for social 
change. Alison and I were less likely can-
vassers. Alison, a physics major, was about to 
head to France for the year to teach English. 
And I, a self-proclaimed bookworm, had 
been galvanized into political action for the 
first time, determined to direct my disillu-
sionment with my government into more 
than just another angry New Jersey ballot. 

Emerging each morning from our head-
quarters in Emily's basement, we would drive 
around the state 
west to Concord, up to the 
North Country, down to Nashua on the 
Massachusetts border 
to find our "turf": 
neighborhoods targeted for their consistently 
low voter turn-out. We planted ourselves on 
the doorsteps of unregistered voters. As five 
students in a small New Englarid state, we 
hoped we could reach, at best, a few thou-
sand people. But as one node in the 
2004ward network 
which sent 150 college ·. 
students, over 55 of them Yalies, to 14 swing 
states this summer 
we hoped that we could 
significantly increase voter participation 
before November 2nd. 

2004ward grew out of a daily Yale spec-
tacle: broadly themed, half-serious conversa-
tions being tossed around the dining hall like 
salad. Most of these seedling ideas are swept 
into the trash with dinner's leftovers, but, 
unlike so many others, the conversation 
which bore 2004ward took root in the minds 
of three veteran activists. 

2004ward's founders, Ana Mufioz, Ben 
Healey and Alek Felstiner, voted for the first 
time in 2000 and were freshman at Yale dur-
ing the controversy following George W. 
Bush's election. Ana remembers thinking that 
the whole election was a fluke, but, when in 
2002 Republicans flooded into the other 
branches of the government, she perceived 
the country coursing swiftly towards conser-
vattsm. 

Both the 2000 and the 2002 election 
saw record lows in voter turnout. For Ana 
and like-minded students, this mass of non-
voters 
almost half the country 
was a 
source of both frustration and hope. These 
students knew that the margins of conserva-
tive victory had been narrow, and if more 
people had voted, the results could have been 
different. In 2002, over brunch in Branford 
College, their conversation turned to com-
bating apathy. Ana recalled, "We said, 'We 
wish we could just go door to door and say, 
it's not about partisan politics, you're being 
fucked!"' 

In their search for the most effective 
means of influencing the election, Ana, Ben 
and Alek returned in the fall of 2003 to the 
crux of their idea 
going door to door and 
talking politics with American voters. Their 
original goal was to fmd fifty Yale students to 
train in basic grassroots organizing, trans-
forming them into what Ana calls "conduits 
for better messaging." Enthusiastic college 
students could initiate "respectful one-on-
one interactions," informing non-voters, 
through canvassing and phonebanking, how 
their vote could influence their lives. 

From the beginning, the founders of 
2004ward looked beyond New Haven and 
Connecticut. Although their activist back-
grounds taught them the ins and outs of the 
political Connecticut turf, they were tempt-
ed by unknown territory 
especially the 
swing states. Connecticut is, after all, a solid-
ly Democratic state, and, as Alek explained, 
national progressive groups wanted to fund 
election work on embattled ground. As 
2004ward expanded into a core group of 
experienced organizers, Alek, as the on-cam-
pus coordinator, started working on their 
first challenge: "to convince people that the 
most important· thing people of our genera-
tion could do right now was work on the 
election." 

Students didn't need much convincing. 
At the first 2004ward meeting before winter 
break, over fifty people showed up 
twice as 
many as expected. Alek and a few others met 
personally with everyone who expressed 
interest, finding out what motivated these 
recruits and trying to get them to commit. 
Meanwhile, before winter break, Noah 
Do bin-Bernstein, the outreach coordinator, 
made a few phone calls to students at other 
schools. The response 
immediate and over-
whelming 
took him by surprise. By spring 
term, he was spending three hours a day on 
the phone with students from over a dozen 
colleges, all of them clamoring to participate. 

Many of the potential participants came 
to 2004ward with a single-min~dness of 
purpose: getting President Bush out of office. 
And, originally, the recruitment efforts 
worked off the steam of anti-Bush anger. 
Posters on bulletin boards around campus 
asked, "Do you want to defeat Bush in 
2004?" and e-mails promised, "This summer 
dozens of Yalies will work in ~ng states to 
help take back our country." 


"The initial frustration does come from 
seeing someone like Bush in office: corrupt,
