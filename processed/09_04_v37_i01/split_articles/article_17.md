EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
to conjure ominous images of popular affec-
tion and nostalgia for the USSR by describing 
tourists in Prague who enthusiastically 
bought up Soviet memorabilia, or a magazine 
editor who rejected an article of hers, calling 
it "too anti-Soviet." "Still, it is hard to imag-
ine that contemporary Western readers are 
really all that keen on Stalin, the Gulag's 
greatest proponent, or nostalgic for the gold-
en days of Soviet mastery. Genocide, Power's 
chosen subject matter, is even less controver-
sial: ·the very word bespeaks moral repug-
nance and atrocity of the highest magnitude. 
No student of 20th century history requires 
her fastidious accounts of torture, death and 
: destruction in Germany, Cambodia or 
· Rwanda to realize the horrifying nature of 
· these incidents. Indeed, the remarkable pat-
• · tern the two authors set is almost certain to be 
: broken by next year's non-fiction Pulitzer 
' winner simply because the century contains 
: few other tragedies that could match these. 


Just because these events are well-known, 
• : however, does not mean that they are well-
: understood. Both authors amply demonstrate 
· that general popular awareness does not do 
: justice to the scope of these atrocities. 
: Though she hesitates to give aggregate num-
' · bers, Applebaum estimates that 28.7 million 
• ' people pass~d through Soviet-forced labor 
: camps, several million never to emerge. 
• : Despite the obvious untold injury to their 
; society, many people in the former Soviet 
: Union are hesitant to galvanize widespread 
• · remembrance and recovery. A Russian author 
Applebaum quotes wrote in 1989, "And the 
• · killers? The killers live on ... " 


Power shines her light onto better known 
: instances of genocide: Armenians in Turkey; 
• : Jews, Poles and others in the Holocaust; 
' Cambodians by their own Khmer Rouge 
; 
regime ~ Kurds in Iraq; Bosnian Muslims in 
; Serbia; and Tutsis in Rwanda. Still, these tales 
: of systematic killing that she shares are by no 
• : means fully assimilated into popular con-
. sciousness. Her book's most poignant claim 
: for the necessity of memory comes from 
• : Adolf Hitler, who asked his military chiefs in 
: 1939, "Who today still speaks of the massacre 
' · of the Armenians?" 


After conceding the value of education, 
: however, the authors diverge starkly in their 
• ; .aims. Power, examining the response of the 
: "United States to each large-scale atrocity, is 
: .able to make specific recommendations for 
• : /uture 
policy 
and 
political 
response. 
: :Applebaum, in contrast, deals with how peo-
• • ·ple create and respond to terrible circum-
• 
~ stances and with what that tells us about "the 
. 28 
darker side of our own human nature." She 
does not hope to deter future tragedy; rather, 
she writes, "This book was not written 'so 
that it will not happen again,' as the cliche 
would have it. This book was written because 
it almost certainly will happen again." Her 
approach, heavily reliant on memoirs and 
anecdotes, illuminates the human side of 
tragedy without making any promise of 
future improvement. 


f Applebaum's purpose is not exactly 
heartening, Power offers little better. 
Though she celebrates the efforts of jour-
nalists, politicians, government officials and 
others who pressed for action in the face of 
unfolding genocide 
almost always to no 
avail 
Power suggests that a clear conclusion 
can be drawn from how rarely these advocates 
surfaced. The consistent failure of the US 
• government to respond to genocide, she 
argues, is not a failure at all. It is the logical 
and deliberate outcome of present political 
value system, in which politicians and citizens 
share a common set of priorities: suffice it to 
say, "It's not genocide, stupid." 


The magnitude of this inaction, Power 
shows, is as shocking as it is immoral. In part 
because she deals with better known cases of 
genocide than the Gulag, her readers may be 
most startled not by her descriptions of each 
tragedy but by her revelations of just how 
much US politicians and-policy-makers knew 
about each, and how little they did to 
respond. 


Again and again, Power finds that those at 
the highest level of US government knew 
what was unfolding and failed to act. 
President Jimmy Carter, remembered as one 
of the greatest proponents of human rights to 
occupy the White House, discounted Khmer 
Rouge atrocities because of the US's burgeon-
ing alliance with China, a KR ally, and the 
desire to check the expansion of Soviet influ-
ence. The Iraqi government's use of chemical 
weapons against entire Kurdish villages in the 
late 1980s was overlooked because Saddam 
Hussein was simultaneously waging war 
· against Iran, a more established US political 
foe. In every case 
from the Armenian to the 
Bosnian and Rwandan genocides 
the US 
was hesitant to respond, eager to preserve its 
delicate neutrality, its freedom from moral 
implication and most important of all, its 
lack of involvement on the ground. 


More sympathetically, Power explains, 
policy-makers, like many civilians, simply 
had trouble conceiving of torture, murder 
and destruction taking place on such a large 
scale. Some even recognized this personal 
inability. Faced with testimony from a Polish 
diplomat who had seen both the Warsaw 
Ghetto and the Belzec death camp firsthand, 
US Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter 
responded by telling him, "I don't believe 
you." When the young man protested, 
Franfurter explained, "I do not mean that you 
are lying. I simply said I cannot believe you." 


Given such incapacity, Power's narrative, 
crafted in careful detail and hundreds of foot-
notes, is invaluable. 


The greatest strength of Power's argument 
is her suggestion of a litany of "soft respons-
es" to genocide that do not require military 
intervention. Power argues for public denun-
ciations, action in the UN, and suspension of 
a nation's "economic perks" with indignation 
and an enraged sense of what might have 
been. 


This approach, however, is weakened by 
Power's overall conclusion: the US govern-
ment 
from the president down to the con-
gressional and State Department high brass:-
rarely wants to deal with the problem of 
unfolding genocide, unless massive public or . 
diplomatic pressure has made it impossible 
not to. The reason, Power declares, is not lack 
of information. As a State Department 
Middle East specialist during the Iraqi killing 
of Kurds recalls in the book, "The facts were 
available, but you don't get the full facts 
unless you want the full facts." 


or, one realizes after reading Gulag, 
will the facts always be basis enough 
to stop unfolding terror. Because the 
Gulag spanned several decades and entangled 
countless government ministries, industries, 
and prison outposts, classifying it under the 
traditional rubric of international crimes is 
difficult 
and deterring it may well have 
been impossible. As the Supreme Court jus-
tice said, conceiving of killing on such a 
broad scale is almost beyond our capacity for 
imagination. The case of the Gulag, as 
Applebaum describes it, pushes one's sense of 
befuddlement almost to a breaking point. An 
off-color joke, a neighbor's baseless suspicion, 
or knowledge of a foreign language was 
enough to merit over a decade of hard labor 
in unbearable, if not intentionally murder-
ous, conditions. Whole cities and industries 
were built on the backs of slave laborers. Yet '
at almost no point did the Soviet government 
operate death camps like those made infa-
mous by the Nazis, images of which

inevitably come to mind at the very mention 
of the word "genocide." The boundaries 
between intention and neglect, murder and 
mismanagement, are thus hard to delineate in 
this case. Applebaum is careful to point out . 
that in the USSR, many of the shortages and 
cruelties of camp life were merely amplifica-
tions of the reality in the so-called free world 
outside. Even the paradox of promoting love 
of country and party while working people to 
near death was merely an extension of the 
often "ludicrous" gap between Soviet propa-
ganda and Soviet reality. The blatant disre-
gard shown for human life within the Gulag, 
also., seems like an amplification of a broader 
Soviet phenomenon. 


In the face of such diffuse and well-
entrenched tragedy, perpetrated by one of the 
world's great superpowers, Power's soft solu-
tions seem unlikely to have had much effect. 
Applebaum thus faces a different sort of chal-
lenge 
not of corp.paring cases and making 
inferences, but of gleaning a lesson from a 
unique, harrowing, and complex saga. 


At best, Applebaum's narrative admonish-
es her readers not to worsen the situation-
for, though it seems unlikely, the Gulag's 
observers and inhabitants did indeed con-
tribute. In 1945, with the Treaty of Yalta, 
both the US and British governments agreed 
to repatriate all Soviet citizens in territories 
under their control despite clear evidence of 
what would happen to them in their home-
land. Those who protested were tricked into 
returning or deported by force. As a result, 
tens of thousands of men and women who 
might have escaped instead disappeared into 
the Gulag 
a chapter of the Soviet travesty 
that Applebaum says subsequent Western 
scholars have been hesitant to discuss. 


Prisoners and civilians added to the 
Gulag's countless layers of sadness and irony, 
by shunning, robbing, torturing and degrad-
ing one another. Applebaum weaves these 
saddening anecdotes of these crimes with 
more heartening ones, contravening the too-
common retrospective tendency to cast all 
victims as innocents. Her story is less crisp, 
cohesive and constructive than Power's, with 
less indignation and fewer "what-ifs" to pre-
vent her reader from drowning in the dark-
ness of self-destruction permeating the entire 
600-page work. Power, it seems, draws a road 
map 
towards 
improvement, 
while 
Applebaum offers no such plan. But then, 
even if a road did exist out of the Soviet 
Gulag, where could that knowledge be 
applied today?

pplebaum, for one, is not without a 
suggestion. Her most resonant appeal 
comparison is with present 
day North Korea. In the midst of the Gulag 
narrative, Applebaum writes that 400,000 
people are estimated to have died in North 
Korean "punishment centers," which today 
hold an estimated 200,000 prisoners, many 
working as forced laborers. These centers, lit-
tle noticed in the West, are eerily reminiscent 
of the Soviet Gulag. Power's study, in con-
trast, lends itself as a lens to a less diffuse pre-
sent-day atrocity. When she spoke at Yale last 
April, Power warned her audience about the 
"text-book" case of genocide unfolding in 
Darfur, where the Sudanese government has 
armed Arab militias now responsible for the 
murder or displacement of over a million eth-
nically black Darfur residents. 


Of the two authors, only Power makes 
clear what tools may be deployed in an effort 
to halt tragedies like those in Darfur and 
North Korea, the definitive histories of which 
cannot yet be written. Applebaum, instead, 
elucidates the humanity of the victims, 
strained, cracked and contorted by the inhu-
manity of their situation. The authors' voices 
meet again only in the plea that runs through 
both texts. They ask readers to wrestle with 
the sheer scope of these horrors that seem to 
defy belief: believe it, their books demand, 
believe it.
