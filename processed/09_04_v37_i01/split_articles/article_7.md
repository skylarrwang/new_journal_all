EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
THIS MONTH, the final needle will be 
threaded, the final yard of fabric cut, and the 
final Singer sewing machine sold at the landmark Horowitz Bros. store whose facade has 
dominated lower Chapel Street for 76 years. 
Modernity has slowly hemmed in the business; over the next few weeks, the entire stock 
will be liquidated during a massive sale, in an 
attempt to have everything carried out by the 
few people in this city who still sew. The 
"everything must go" mindset is particularly 
traumatic for the Horowitz family. 

Unlike 
the goods, the customers and the employees 
seem unable to "go" 
to cope with Horowitz 
Bros. being cut from the cloth of downtown 
New Haven. 

For Julia DiLullo, the closing marks the 
end. of an era. After 42 years working in the 
"always hectic" custom and drapery department, she knows that it's time to close. Her 
quiet tone divulges the truth behind her 
apparent reconciliation with this milestone. 
She is an old woman, neatly dressed in muted 
khaki tones and wearing eyeglasses, sitting 
amongst prints in cottons, poplins and linens. 
"I don't even take vacation 
that's how much 
I like to be with people," she says. "Every day 
here is special." 

The store, managed by cousins Arthur 
and Leonard Horowitz, is divided into 
makeshift departments, each presided over by 
a cautious saleswoman with me eye of a loving mother. There are bundles of fabric in 
plaids, solids, stripes, holiday prints. 
You 
name it, Horowitz Bros. has it. The notions 
department has a colorful collection of trim 
in all styles and sizes. "I came as a baby," 
Rose, another saleswoman, laughs. Thirty-
seven years later she still looks forward to 
coming to work here every day. :"The customers are crying. They don't want to see us 
go. A lot of my regulars have asked for my 
phone number." But even Rose admits that 
the industry has changed dramatically in the 
past few decades. The "buy it, sew it, wear it 
the next day" shopper simply doesn't exist 
anymore. Art Horowitz is keenly aware of the 
reasons his "home" has to close and knows he 
can not do anything to fight it. "It used to be 
very prestigious for young girls to sew 
prom 
dresses, back to school clothes," he says. "But 
the industry began to atrophy in the late 
1970s." 

Many of today's students can't even 
imagine a time when picking that savvy and 
stylish first-day-of-school outfit meant don-
ning a beautifully hand-stitched original, not 
something bought on a recent trip to the 
mall. The closing of Horowitz Bros. is a symbolic farewell to the once wide-spread domestic pleasure of sewing, but also, to a generation that took pride in originality and "innovation in a way few Yale students today can 
understand. 

The store is closing, and the 
habit that kept it in business is disappearing. 
In fact, this family-owned and -managed 
retail business is one of the last in its predominantly extinct sector. The original 
Horowitz brothers were Russian immigrants 
who left a life of peasantry to pursue their 
American dream. They first started peddling 
fabric on Grand Avenue in 1916. ~ Today, 
their legacy is carried on by cousins Leonard 
and Arthur Horowitz. Leonard's brother 
Phillip recently passed away. The trio had 
received accolades for its loyalty and personality by The New York Times and local papers 
like The New Haven Register and The 
Advocate. Art Horowitz attributes their reputation for excellence to "perseverance." Yet, as 
a salesman, he's a self-proclaimed softie: ''I'm 
not a hard nose. I'm one of those who walks 
away," he says. Geraldine Marchitto laughs. 
She managed the Hamden store and has been 
working at Horowitz Bros. since she was in 
high school more than three decades ago. She 
knows that his reputation and long-standing 
commitment to Art's work are proof that 
being a softie all these years has gotten the job 
done. 

While many of the employees plan to 
retire~ Maria Acampora, a smiling, middle 
aged woman, who has been working with Art 
for 30 years, will go job-hunting. 
As she 
descends slowly in the famous 125-year old 
elevator that is· a trademark of the store, she 
says with a sigh, "I don't think I'll find anyone 
as good to work for." Paul, the authorized 
Singer sewing machine dealer who has been 
behind the counter for 22 years overhears her 
extolling Art and calls out, "He's the man." 

The departure of Horowitz Bros. will 
leave a gap in the patchwork of downtown 
New Haven. The famous storefront sign that 
passers-by say has been there "forever" 
deserves preservation in a local museum, as a · 
reminder that economic development should 
not bulldoze the past, but incorporate it into 
the future. 


**Title: Virtually Friends**
**Author:  (Not specified)**

ON AUGUST 7, one Yale freshman was 
faced with a serious problem, one that could 
only be solved by her closest friends: "I have 
the worst case of the hiccups right now ... I 
hiccuped in my living room and it actually 
echoed," she wrote desperately. "It's bad. I 
tried sugar, water, holding my breath ... I'm 
all out of ideas. Anyone know of any effective 
remedies for the hiccups?" Her plea did not 
come in the form of an urgent telegram or a 
nervous phone message. 

Instead, she posted her urgent inquiry on 
an online "blog" community, LiveJournal, a 
forum reserved for Yale freshmen. The site 
can be accessed by anyone (http://www .. 
LiveJournal.com/ community/yale2008) and 
is currently used by ~37 devout members. A 
Yale acceptance letter is a prerequisite to join 
the forum, though anyone can post comments anonymously. But the majority of the 
thousands of entries, which date back to early 
April, are the product of a core of about thirty LiveJournalers. The website is a social 
forum in which thefacebook users post profiles 
littered with accomplishments, share a 
few racy pictures (on one thread, 
a current freshman poses semi-
nude in a genie costume), and 
"add" new friends to their bios-
soming social networks. 

The freshman LiveJournal has practical 
uses as well. Journalers have asked their classmates' advice on good summer reads, organized a massive panlist for future students 
who plan to stay sober, and sought out other 
homosexual students to eliminate anxiety. 
But the majority of the site contains the out-
pourings of angsty freshmen, who, unsure of 
what to expect in the fall, use the entries to 
raise the questions all of us surely confronted 
before we packed off to school, such 
as: "How will I get my keys on moving in day?" or, "How do we register 
for classes?" and of course, ''Anyone know of 
any effective remedies for the hiccups?" 

With only 144 members representing a 
freshman 
class 
of about 
1,300, 
the 
LiveJournal website only affects a small percentage of the '08 social scene. But even if 
freshmen aren't involved in the LiveJournal 
community, they may be members of 
Xanga 
a similarly formatted website that 
links 44 '08ers; and of course, there's thefacebook.com, a website connecting the perfected 
profiles of over 2800 Yale students and 
alums 
roughly 700 of which come from the 
class of 2008. There are more freshmen on 
the facebook than seniors, and the majority of 
the youngest class has far more "friends" than 
their upperclassmen peers. 

For most Yalies there is a key rule of face-
book etiquette: you only add people you 
know. That's 
why 
the freshman presence on theface-
book.com this summer was so 
shocking. As of August 3, one freshman had 
listed 142 friends, a stat that easily placed him 
within the top five percent ofYale's "popular" 
elite. And the freshmen didn't just "add" 
friends. They messaged. And they messaged 
people they didn't know. Frespmen with similar musical interests messaged me to comment on my taste, while more attractive 
friends of mine were messaged simply based 
on their good looks. Liz Carlin, a sophomore, 
was messaged by 
several 
freshmen 
before they arrived 
on campus. "It was nice but kind of weird 
because sometimes they didn't even send me a 
note to say why they were asking to be my 
friend," she commented later. 

This summer, in the '~bout Me" box of 
his thefacebook.com profile, Senior Jason 
Farago ranted against the freshman facebook 
presence: "Can somebody please explain to 
me why over two hundred 2008ers are 
already on this overloaded rickshaw of a website? And how do you all already have dozens 
of 'friends' 
have you met these people 
somewhere? And MAJORS? (And not just 
any old majors 
at least half of you seem to 
have been pre-approved for EP&E, as if Seyla 
Benhabib were doling out high-interest credit cards)." Though one may interpret Farago's 
satire as protective of thefacebook.com traditions, one sophomore agreed, noting how 
reckless 
friend-
adding had ruined 
the "character" of 
the site, or at least 
damaged its purpose-to provide a real 
mapped out network of social groups and to 
helping students stay in contact with friends. 

By "adding" people they had never met, 
freshmen weren't using thefacebook.com to 
cement relationships but to form them. 

"Lots of freshmen seem to know each 
other already," observed Yusuf Samara, a 
Davenport freshman counselor, as he took a 
break moving boxes into Welch. Steven 
Abramowitz, another counselor, agreed, 
adding that, "They used the facebook and the 
LiveJournal to ... arrange [their] suites." 

Melissa Gonzalez MC '08, one of the most 
dependable members of the Live Journal community, claims that her social life has already 
benefited from her Internet addiction, "~I just 
actually ran into a kid 
who I met on the journal," she gushed on her 
first day at Yale. "It's a lot less intimidating, 
even if you just talk on the Internet or the 
phone or something. At least it's something." 

But even Gonzalez needs some face-to-face 
socialization. 

That's why a group of LiveJournalers 
ended up hanging out by the steps of 
Bingham on the night of August 27, by piles 
of torn up gift boxes and an enormous birthday cake. The party was for two LiveJournal 
members, both born on August 27, who had 
faced the prospect of a lonely birthday in a 
friendless town. "If it wasn't for LiveJournal, 
I'd be in my room, doing nothing," one of the 
attendees noted. Turning to a boy in a plaid 
shirt and glasses, a freshman girl noted sue-
