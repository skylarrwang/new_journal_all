cinctly, "Hi, we're friends. We met on the-
facebook.com," and the two shook hands.


If anything describes the site's diverse
members, it's pride. Many students are more
than willing to share both their personal
essays and their personal lives. One freshman
wrote a chipper entry regarding online chat-
ting, "I was up early doing homework one
day, and usually my buddy list is empty
because everyone else is asleep.... However,
now that I've added all you Yalies, there's a
couple of people online at 5 in the morning
too. I've never seen anybody go online that
early!" And in one entry, nearly the entire
community posted their college essays. With
51 individual college essay posts, the brief
skim through the enormous list would give
anyone a warm pang of pity for college
admissions officers, who are used to lines like,
"His simmering poems bloom brilliantly
within the shadows of the room as he sparked
a revolution in my soul."

The website also provides a space to say
things one probably wouldn't say in person ..
"What's so bad about elitism?" one boy
wrote, "Elitism is just realizing that you are
better than everyone else." A few days later, in
a brief description, one freshman noted, ''I'm
the greatest person in the world. Thank you."

In response to entries like these, one
joU.rnaler wrote, "I wondered, 'if these kids
are all going to Yale, then they must be
smart ... [but] some of the things that have
been said here have been completely bull-
shit!!'" As Jonny Dach noted, "People are not
the same in real life as they are on
LiveJournal, where they can choose what
facet of their personality to express, where
they can exaggerate their merits and hide
their flaws. So when they say they 'get to
know' each other online, really they're getting
to know these fake versions of each other."

The question is how this "faking" will
affect students' social lives when they come to
school. Do these students have more friends,
or fewer real friends? Whatever the answer,

whether this is a community of friends, or
isolated individuals connected only by a frag-
ile wire, they are certainly there to help each
other: within eleven minutes of posting, one
freshman's hiccups had been cured.
