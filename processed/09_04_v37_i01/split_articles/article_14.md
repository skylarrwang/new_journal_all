self-serving, dangerous," said Ana. "But when
you start to speak about how that happens, it
becomes so much broader. Democracy is such
a precious thing; it could be so much more
alive in America."

And in the search for national partners,
Ben Healey decided that the project's focus-
would be on democracy, not on Bush. At one
time, Ben was talking to America Coming
Together, . a George Soros-funded organiza-
tion, which would have let students happity
Bush-bash all summer. But in the end, the
groups that he chose to work with-
USAction,
AssQciation of Community
Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN),
and the Immigrant Workers Freedom
Summer
all focused on non-partisan voter
regtstratton.

These three organizations could all pro-
vide the basics for 2004ward: $1500 stipends
for each intern ($2500 for those on financial
aid) and access to localized offices and staff.
Through these smaller affiliates, the students
would settle in a specific location, learn about
the region, and find out where to find pro-
gressive, unregistered voters. 2004ward's rela-
tionship with these organizations, especially
USAction, allowed Ben to set up a bank
account and goad each 2004ward-er iiuo
fundraising. As summer approached, 160 stu-
dents sent out letters to family friends, aunts,
uncles, grandparents, and asked for money.
Donations accumulated, and, in addition to
the $1500 stipend, 2004ward periodically
sent out its own checks, helping its members
pay for rent _and food.

The tight budget made finding housing
difficult. In May, the Arizona team was still
unsure of where they would be living, and in
Missouri, three Columbia students ended up
renting an apartment that also served as the
office of a local dominatrix. Our New
Hampshire team was lucky: 2004ward helped
us rent a car
our beloved "PimpMobile," a
huge. white Chrysler
and Emily's father gen-
erously offered us his basement.

By spring term exams, the conversation
that Ana, Ben and Alek had over two years
earlier had turned into an unending dialogue.
Logistics for the summer were being franti-
cally worked out, fundraising letters were
being hurriedly written and last-minute
teams were being formed. Meanwhile, the
three founders were scrambling to finish their
senior theses. But at last, after the students'
USAction training session one Sunday morn-
ing in May, the stage was set. The extreme
canvassers were about to be released.


Abi, Jared, Alison, Emily and I,
the 2004ward New Hampshire
team
worked for New Hampshire
Citizens Alliance,
a local affiliate of
USAction. The Citizens Alliance, based
across the street from the shiny gold dome of
the New Hampshire capitol building in
Concord, has fought for 25 years for "social,
economic and political justice for all." Our
team arrived on the brink of a new chal-
lenge
a campaign to register 6,500 new vot-
ers in a state where the law makes voter regis-
tration nearly impossible. Unlike every other
state, in New Hampshire, only a handful of
people
the city or town clerk, the supervi-
sor of the checklist and a few volunteers
are
deputized to register voters. Anyone who
wants to vote must visit these select few, who
are usually only available from 8:30am to
4:30pm on weekdays: inconvenient times for
the average unregistered voter, who works a
low-income job with long hours. But we had
aplan.


"Hi," I would say, after knockin._g on a
door. "My name is Sarah and I'm a volunteer
with New Hampshire Citizen's Alliance.
We're a non-profit, non-partisan organiza-
tion. I'm just going around your neighbor-
hood because right now we're really con-
cerned with fighting for health care in the
state." One in ten New Hampshire residents
has no health insurance, anc:J. many risk losing
their current coverage as small businesses are
pummeled by sky-rocketing rates. Every
band of 2004warders had its local cause, and
ours was health care.

The strategy for hunting down and bag-
ging unregistered voters scripted a series of
attacks, always focusing on issues rather than
voting. To those who opened their doors, I
fust presented a petition demanding accessi-
ble and cost-efficient health care from the
local legislators. According to Carin, our
expert orgamzer, votmg 1s a very senslttve
matter, especially for the guilty non-voter.
Asking people about voter registration
directly was a sure way to get doors slammed
in our faces. In neighborhoods filled with
families dependent on the ever changing
state health care system, most people eagerly
grabbed our clipboards and signed. And as
they were Hlling in their names and address-
es, I introduced "the second part" of our
petition
a yellow voter pledge card. Always
emphasizing the connection between politi-
cians and issues, I would explain that the
only way we (normal people) could influ-
ence them (politicians) was through voting.
I tensed up at this moment, poised to ·
launch into new arguments if refused, ready
to smile and dig deeper if accepted. Fighting
to keep one foot in the door or trying to
make the thirty seconds while they signed as
memorable as possible, I wanted to spark
some passion for civic participation in the
few minutes that I had.

Some would sign our cards without
thinking. Some would preface their signa-
ture with a comment like "Well, I'm regis-
tered already, but I guess I'll sign." (These
were usually lies. After every canvass, we
would check our signatures against the voter
rolls. Every time, sixty to eighty percent of
the people to whom we had talked were
unregistered.)

These c.ards asked nothing more than a
commitment "to register and vote by
November 2nd, 2004," but to us they were
pure gold. We put the names of already reg-
istered voters aside, saving them for basic
"get-out-the-vote" efforts in October. We
focused instead on unregistered voters, call-
ing to inform them of extended hours, sur-
veys about issues important to them, and
mailings with voter information. The voter
registration plan demanded that we follow
up with each unregistered voter five to seven
times. We would stay in the Concord office
until nine or ten at night, slowly making our
way through lists of names and numbers,
talking to each person for five or ten minutes
about their healthcare problems, their hatred
of politicians or their loQ.g hours at work.

Sometimes we coordinated other events: a
vOlunteer-staffed phonebank, a presentation
at• a homeless shelter, a booth at a public
hausing fair. When we · got tired, we amused
ourselves dreaming up extreme organizing
challenges. Challenge #1: After being air-
dropped into a strange city, naked, you have
thirty days to organize a popular revolt. Short
of such adventures, we did propel a few peo-
ple to their town hall to register because we
had shown up on their doorsteps.

true non-voters, those who have
proudly avoided the polls and politics,
tried to escape registering by a more
direct route. They'd simply announce "I don't
vote," mumble that they're not interested in
politics and begin to close the door. At the
b~inning of the summer, I would ask "Why
not?" partially because I just wanted to
lll!derstand. They would offer excuses
they
di<:ln't know about the candidate's positions,
nothing would change, they didn't have
time
and I would rebut with information.

But by the end of the summer, my friends
and I had stopped asking why. Too many peo-
pl~ just didn't want to cast a ballot
or as one
woman told Abi, before she slammed the
door, "I don't vote vote."

: NHCA employed organizers who were
supposed to "cut turf" for canvasses, accord-
ing to som~ formula involving voter turn-out,
population density and first-hand experience.
But as we became more independent and the
organizers busier, we strategically picked
streets to walk by piling in a car and driving
around looking for "our sort of people," who
generally lived in small, multi-family houses,
on crowded streets and in need of paint jobs.
We found some of the best streets this way, as
well as a street that I walked for two hours to
come up with only two signatures, one from
a y.roman who was clearly registered and the
other from a landlord who told me outright
he was going to vote for Bush. When summer
and its heat set in, a certain malaise marked
every canvass; apprehensive of a long, point-
less canvass, we would loiter at the ubiquitous
Dunkin' Donuts (we measured out our lives
by Dunkin' Donuts drive-thrus) for fifteen
minutes, half-an-hour, waiting for the sugar · ·
to propel us out into the sun.

The key to any good canvass was finding
one good conversation. We all loved talking
to felons. In New Hampshire, unlike many
other states, felons can vote, even if they're
still on parole and probation. Most felons
aren't aware of this right. In Manchester, Jared
met "Dan from Ward 5," a coffee-addicted,
guitar-playing felon from New Jersey, who
wanted to help us throw a block party in his
neighborhood to get people excited and
involved in politics. The only trump to meet-
ing people like Dan was canvassing a whole
group: Alison was invited into a house party;
a mother sat me down at her kitchen table
and convinced her son and his break-dancing
friends to stop spinning around her living
room and come talk to me; Jared, in his
record-breaking canvass of 28 pledge cards in
three hours, would run into groups just sit-
ting outside and enjoying the day, happy to
hear what he had to say. In public housing, it
seemed that every single door would open to
a family who needed and wanted information
about health care, who hadn't made the con-
nection between their lives and their politics
but who understood and wanted to register.

We had no way of knowing what effect
these encounters had. Though we spent every
day talking and thinking about voting and
registering, each conversation was only two or
three minutes long. The questions always
remained: did people understand how impor-
tant it was that they vote? Would they regis-
ter in the end
and, if they did, would they
vote the way we wanted? Despite our day jobs
as non-partisan advocates of civic participa-
tion, we still cared deeply about the outcome
of the election.

cross the country, other 2004warders
wrestled with the blessings and curses
ot issues-based organizing. The issues
varied, each one shaped by the local land-
scape. In Florida, students petitioned and col-
lected signatures to put an initiative for a liv-
ing wage on the ballot. As part of the
Immigrant Workers Freedom Summer, orga-
nizers in Arizona would spend three days a
week registering voters, then part of the
group would hike out into the desert, bring-
ing basic humanitarian aid
food, water and
medical aid
to illegal immigrants.

At the beginning of August, voters in
Missouri's primary, in addition to electing a
sheriff and state senator, could vote to amend
the state constitution to ban gay marriage.
_ Participation jumped from 22o/o the previous
year to 40% of eligible voters. The local
2004ward team, meanwhile, was working
with ACORN to organize around living-wage
issues
and though most were less than
thrilled by Missouri's embrace of the anti-gay
marriage amendment, they would take civic
engagement where they could get it.

2004warder Mischa Byruck didn't worry too
much about his newly registered voters ally-
ing themselves with the President because of
this issue. "Everyone says God bless you here.
There are churches everywhere," he said. But
in his experience, these religious beliefs do
not sway voters away from their Democratic
leanings
they would vote on the economy
more than any other issue.

In order to convincingly represent issues
to people long-accustomed to dealing with
them, the 2004ward teams had to get to
know the communities in which they were
living. Most participants chose to displace
themselves from their home territory and
tackle unfamiliar sections of the country, only
to encounter, to their surprise, distinct cul-
ture shock.

Although Ana had migrated from "mid-
Atlantic" Maryland to the Northeast for col-
lege, she was not prepared for the difference
she encountered in Arizona. "First of all," she
said, "every single building looks new. It's
really hard to distinguish neighborhoods
from each other, like you can in the
Northeast. Everything is one level. Even more
surprising to her was the resonance of the
local issue the Arizona 2004ward clan had
taken up: immigration. "I don't think I ever
really understood }:low the biggest problem in
a place can permeate a society in an entire
way. Everyone here has something to say
about immigration."

The vaguely defined regionalism in
America, it turns out, may actually mean
something. "To be Midwestern," Mischa
explains, "I think it means to have more of an
understanding of the populist, rather than the
intellectual history of America. Nature can
kill you
and there's this huge awareness of
space. You never have trouble parking. It's
amazing! You know why? There's lots of
space.

If in New Hampshire we couldn't find
parking, we could at least easily find cheap
alcohol at the state-sponsored liquor stores
along the border with the state's southern
neighbor, "Taxachusetts." Just a short three-
hour
drive
from
New
Haven,
Hampshire is a world of its own
there is a
reason the Libertarians decided to migrate
here. The state motto, "Live Free or Die,"
becomes a mantra, "free" meaning mostly
"free from any tax increases." In the last elec-
tion for the governorship, Craig Benson,
widely known for his corruption, won by a
landslide against an opponent who dared to
propose a state-wide income tax.

At times, the confusion of being a
stranger in one's own country brought on a
sort of identity crisis. Ana was surprised to
find that, instead of a Yale student or a mem-
ber of the middle class, in Arizona she felt
most like "a person from the Northeast."
"That stereotype on my part," she said,
"makes me understand why we have red states
and why we have blue states."

ince no overall numbers exist for how
many new voters 2004ward volunteers
registered this summer, their real contri-
bution is difficult to measure. Many of the
recent graduates will continue with their elec-
toral work in some form until November,
while some undergraduates intend to put
their extreme canvassing skills to work on
weekenqs. Though the 2004warders will
probably never fmd themselves all in the same
room, they now share a basic unity of skills,
and the founders think they have achieved
what the wanted. The effects, they hope, will
be felt on campus as well as across the nation.

"I think these individuals will influence cam-
pus politics with great strength, an understat-
ing of direct action and organizing and the
nuts and bolts of electoral work," said Healey,
himself a New Haven alderman.

As
the
five
Hampshire
2004warders left our adopted state at the end
of the summer, we promised NHCA that we
would soon return, with reinforcements. And
that no matter what, we would be there on
election day, fighting to get every last pro-
gressive in New Hampshire into a voting
booth. Back at Yale, the campus is already
abounding with students asking each other
how their summers went
but,
until
November 2, we won't be able to fully answer
that question.
