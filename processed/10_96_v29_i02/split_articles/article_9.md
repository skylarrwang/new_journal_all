Tk Univmity has onu again reackd that 
stage in hi.swry whm peopk are talking about tk 
New Yak, presumably to be distinguished from 
the Old Yale, which in its own day was 
presumably considned New. 
Wishing to share in this modnnity, wt havt 
chosen The New Journal as the name for our 
publication. &sides, things seemed slow around 
here.

"'TWenty-nine years later, things still feel slow 
1 around here. The foundations of Yale 
never sh ake, but there 
something to be said for 
stability. As the world 
approaches the third 
millennium, Yale ap-
proaches its tri-centenniaJ. 
Like death and taxes, the 
institution of Yale is irritating, 
but its consistency is reassuring. 
Yet taking comfort in 
inevitable also leads to lack of action on 
campus. Things are done halfway, to a point of 
mediocrity rather than excellence. Yalies 
organize a graduate student union, but let it 
disappear under administrative pressure. We 
establish singing groups and secret societies, 
but spend our time railing against them. We 
pay millions to erect immense buildings, but 
refuse to pay the pocket change required to 
maintain them. When the road comes to a 
fork and Yalies have to choose one of rwo 
paths, they sit down in the middle. 

Nearly three weeks ago we witnessed an 
example of Yalies' half-heartedness. Yale Law 
School alumnus Bill Clinton signed the 
Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). 
Legislation with a major impact on Civil 
Rights! Issues of Constitutionality! Yale had to 
emerge from hibernation to wreak vengeance 
upon the nation and a president that dared 
cross it. 

What did Yale muscer? Pastel chalkings, a 
candlelight vigil at the Women's Table, and a 
less-than-rousing debate in the daily paper. 
These minor protests lasted rwo days, then, 
back to business as usual. 

These have become comfortable ways to 
express opinion, without rocking any boats. 
We hear of a policica1Jy incorrect evenr, we 
shrug, and we assume someone else wilJ do 
something. We sign petitions outside 
Commons, and assume--or hope-that this 
will fix the problem, that our voices as Yalies 
and future leaders will not go unheeded. 

A recent poll shows that many Yalies have 
resigned themselves to casting ballots in favor 
of Clinton for lack of a better option. After all, 
why bother creating a ruckus when someone 
already has the race virtually tied up? Even in 
the face of blatantly discriminatory 
legislation. DOMA definds the 
rights of certain individuals by 
offending those of others. In the 
socially conscious 1990s, we 
would not elect a President 
who stands for racial segre-
gation. Yet by voting for 
Clinton, we accomplish the 
equivalent. 

If our campus cannot be 
moved to larger protests against the status quo, 
then what will move us? We at The New 
journal believe that avenues for change lie in 
opportunities to speak out and be heard. 
Discussion leads to shaking the norm-
disturbing the peace, if you will. In this vein, 
we introduce an editors' page to allow for 
candid opinion. We will share our viewpoints, 
without apology, in hopes of spurring debate, 
conversation, and individual thought-a basis 
for discussion that promotes change. 

At the same time, we question our ability 
to fulfill our goal. Who are we to end Yale "as 
we know it"? Lately, politicians are obsessed 
with promises to end things "as we know it." 
Bill is going to "end welfure as we know it." 
Bob wants to "end the IRS as we know it." 
Here at The New journal, we are nor 
convinced. We feel, however, that our 
skepticism should not stop us from jumping 
on the bandwagon of rransformations. Which 
brings us back to the new editors' page. And in 
keeping with the tradition of doing things 
halfway, we've left (most of) the rest of the 
magazine unchanged.
