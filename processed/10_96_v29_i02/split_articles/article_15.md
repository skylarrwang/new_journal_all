EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Though their numbers are perennially smaller 
than those of the Yale College Democrats, the 
Yale College Republicans are innovatively 
using the manpower they have, which has 
swollen into the hundreds this election year. 
"Because of the Yale College Republican's 
smaller numbers and simpler organizational 
structure, th.ere is more of a chance for 
bottom-up activism from regular 
members. If someone has an idea 
they'd like to see happen, they can 
just mention it at a meeting and we'll 
try to do it." 

Debbie Schmuhl (TD '00) is a 
prime example. A first-year student 
in directed studies, she came to Yale 
expecting to get involved in women's 
issues, particularly with regard to the 
election campaign, in which she 
supports Dole. "At Freshperson 
Bazaar," she says, "I stopped by the 
table of the Yale Women's Center. As 
soon as I mentioned that I was pro-
life, I began to feel somewhat 
unwelcome. They were nice to me, 
and the Women's Center is a good 
thing to have on campus, but I could 
tell that there weren't any people who 
really shared my ideas." 

With the encouragement and 
backing of the Yale College 
Republicans, Schmuhl started her 
own organization a month after 
arriving at Yale, called the Women's 
Voter Education Program (WVEP). 
The group held its first meeting last 
week. 

"The aim of the group is to get 
past the idea of treating women like a 
special-interest group. We represent half of 
the voting population; there's got to be more 
than one issue affecting our view of the race. 
It seems like so many women out there think 
c;; or are told that abortion is the only issue 
~ concerning them, but no matter which side 
o 
' 
Id 'thinkth' 
" 
..., youre on, 
ont 
ats true. 

The formation of the group was 
~ accompanied by the first issue of the WVEP 
~newsletter, "Opening Minds." The only 
~ article in it is a piece by Schmuhl outlining 
~ the group's focus in terms borrowed from 
~ Dole's nomination acceptance speech. Also 
]';accompanying the group's formation was a 
~ press release from Mihaljevic announcing the 
if. fledgling organization and tying it to the Yale 
College Republicans. It's a marriage of 
convenience, but Schmuhl, grateful though 
she is to Mihaljevic and the Republicans, 
hopes the program will eventually become 
bipartisan. 

"Our goals are more long-range than 
those of the Yale College Republicans," she 
says. "This is not just something for 1996. 
Our newsletters from now on will deal with 
one specific issue each week that is important 
to women voters." 

The first meeting featured "a core group" 
of five women, but Schmuhl wants to start 
small and grow from there. One of the five 
was Frankie Jones (ES '99), who is pro-choice 
and thinks the new program is badly needed 
at Yale. To Jones, WVEP is a vital addition to 
the Yale community, at least until the 
Women's Center starts focusing more on the 
broader needs of women at Yale. "Honestly," 
she says, "they [the Women's Center] actually 
offer more opportunities for some men than 
they do for me. Programs like BiWays are put 
through there to appeal to bisexual men, 
while Women's Perspective [a group of 
conservative women] was not offered space, 
time, or money. It's crazy." For now, WVEP 
fills the void. 

This is the new bread and butter of the 
Yale College Republicans. They help a group 
like Schmuhl's or Women's Perspective when 
the Women's Center doesn't, and the Yalies 
brought into the program become 
more educated about conservative 
issues and willing to stand up for them. 

"I think the female vote is a big 
area where Dole can win over Yale 
students," says Mihaljevic. "Right now 
female voters may not realize that 
Clinton takes their vote for granted 
because he's pro-choice. Crime, 
education, the economy-these are 
other issues that all women, even if 
they're pro-choice, should consider 
when deciding who to vote for. 
Clinton has ignored these, and that's 
more than enough reason to vote for 
Dole." 

Jones will vote for Dole on 
November 5, but she kind of wishes it 
was Elizabeth. 


**The Yale College Democrats**

And a Left 
In addition to their ruthless 
pursuit of the voting-aged, the Yale 
College Democrats are also a huge 
source of campaign labor for city and 
state Democratic candidates, a 
function that the Yale College 
Republicans do not fill in the 
respective Republican hierarchy. 
Working hand-in-hand with the 
Democratic Coordinated Campaign 
offices on Chapel Street, the Yale College 
Democrats send student volunteers to staff 
the offices and do legwork on campaigns 
that the Democratic brass has designated as 
critical. 

"We've been working on the Gejdenson 
campaign, the Maloney-Franks race, we 
might even send people up to help in the 
Weld-Kerry campaign up in Massachusetts," 
says Kim. "We do much more than the 
College Republicans, so it only follows that 
we have to be a bit more organized. But we 
are open ro a lot of suggestions." 

The Yale College Democrats were 
recently placed "in charge" of the Tri-state 
Area College Democrats. This means that 
Yale is a "warehouse of information" for the 
national campaign, as well as the host site of 
a College Democrat conference that will 
take place in the spring. The group is very 
busy, and doesn't tend to spend time talking 
about issues, though many come up in the 
members' minds. 

"I personally have ~ lot of troubles with 
Clinton," admits Kim in a moment of 
candor unusual among press secretaries. 
"Welfare, DOMA [The Defense of Marriage 
Act], the environment, these things have 
been discussed a lot, and are troubling to 
our executive board. But we're really 
engaged in campaigning right now, and 
we've got to get the best man elected." 

And for you that's Clinton?

**Time Out**

7ime Out 
It seems that everybody has their minds 
made up about where to cast their vote. 
Republicans 
campaign 
for 
Dole, 
Democrats for Clinton. Aren't there 
supposed to be some kind of debates, other 
than those conducted through tabletenrs or 
on TV from Hanford, for people to learn 
about the issues and make an educated 
OCTOBER II, 1996 
choice? I know I'm not the only Clinton 
supporter who wonders how far the 
President can slide to the right before the 
voters say "stop," and I know more than 
one Republican w ho wishes that 
Dole/Kemp were Kemp/Dole or something 
entirely polysyllabic. Where to go for 
inspiration? 

An outsider might look to an 
organization bearing the title "Yale Political 
Union," but President Veronica Tucci (SY 
'98) quickly puts that lark to rest. "We're a 
parliamentary debate society. The election 
has nothing to do with us." 

Forgive us for hoping. 


**Rope-a-Dope: TKO**

Rope-a-Dope: TKO 
I look Mibaljevic in the eye. Dole 
doesn't have a chance here, does he? 
He looks away, smiles, shakes his head. 
"I won't say that," he protests. 
An uphill battle? 
'1\n uphill battle." 

Down for the Count? 
As we go to press, very little election 
excitement has been felt on this campus. 
Kemp is the candidate that's made it closest 
to Yale so far, and he settled for the 
University of New Haven. No rallies, no 
protests, no scandal or intrigue. For 70 
percent of Yalies, that's probably all right. 
Election excitement often accompanies 
changes in political currents, and right now 
the Vote can only be Rocked out of Clinton's 
hands. Things seem pretty stable; Clinton's 
going to win Ward 1, consisting almost 
exclusively of Yalies. Yale is safely in 
Democratic hands. 

An interesting statistic: back in 1988, 
roughly 80 percent of Ward 1 voted for 
Michael Dukakis over George Bush. Was 
Dukakis a stronger Democratic candidate 
than Clinton? Clearly not. Yet Clinton only 
has 70 percent support. It seems, then, that 
campus conservatives exist in greater 
numbers today, or are doing a better job of 
drawing people to their cause. Though it's 
entirely possible that Republicans wilJ always 
be an endangered species at Yale, people like 
Mihaljevic and Schmuhl are keeping alive 
not only the Republican flame, but the 
possibility that campus conservatism will rise 
again. 


**Stripping Away Tradition**
**Page number(s): 12**

Stripping Away Tradition 
Reason No. 1: "'t represents all that is alive and young about this 
school and to abandon it because of an inconvenience or a fear is to 
give in to entropy, old age, despair, and death. " 

The man with the rubber chicken on his shoulder has drafted a 
Nudist Manifesto. 

Reason No. 2: "'t is a Saybrook tradition that contributes to the 
college's community spirit. " 

This document is a bold statement of intent announcing to the 
world that the fight against tradition will not succeed. 

Reason No. 3: "Part of the college experience is maintaining the 
traditions and joys of the past. What would happen if we stopped 
having graduation on Old Campus? What would happen if we took the 
freshmen off Old Campus? What if]E didn't suck?" 

Dan Fingerman (SY '00) is the man with the chicken on his 
shoulder. Although h!! is responsible for rallying the signatories of 
this document, he is not the only one engaged in the battle to 
prevent the avatars of progress from trampling over the glorious 
traditions of the past. 

Reason No. 4: "Because I Like when people throw cold cuts .at my 
naked body. " 

Fingerman is trying to save the Saybrook Strip. To help propel 
the effort, he has tirelessly collected over 50 reasons why the Strip 
must be salvaged. Between discussions about buying seat cushions 
for the Saybrook TV room and funding a square dance, Fingerman 
presents his document to the 25-odd students assembled at the 
Saybrook College Council meeting. 

No one quite understands why Fingerman has a rubber chicken 
over his shoulder, but it seems a good metaphor for the absurdity of 
the attempt to kill the most prominent piece of Yale's nudity 
tradition. He refers to the chicken as an "old friend" named Wt.lbur. 
"He just happens to fit really well with the Strip," Fingerman says. 
Wilbur, hanging lifelessly over Fingerman's shoulder, has been 
plucked down to his synthetic skin. 

Supporting Fingerman's (and Wilbur's) effort are Saybrook 
Master Antonio Lasaga (Hon. MA '84) and every feisty Saybrugian 
you can find that still gives a damn about residential college spirit. 

A long-time practice at Yale's home football games, the 
Saybrook Strip-a third quarter strip down to boxers and bras 
accompanied by the Yale Precision Marching Band's (YPMB) 
rendition of "The Stripper"-is in danger because of a recent 
addendum to the tradition. 

Along with dropped drawers and unlaced shoes, a hail of rotten 
fruit and half-eaten sandwiches thrown by the other residential 
12 
colleges has become a part of the Strip in recent years. (This, of 
course, is rooted in the jealousy other students harbor over their 
exclusion from the fun of Saybrook's half-naked co-eds.) The 
YPMB, ordinarily seated directly in front of Saybrook, got to share 
in the experience of being knocked senseless by soda cans and bits of 
turkey. Not known for being one of the more rigid organizations at 
Yale, YPMB's list of instruments has included such untraditional 
musical objects as boomerangs, kazoos, and stuffed animals among 
the standard tubas and trumpets. Most incarnations of the band 
have not made a fuss about the mess. 

T
he "enemy" in the struggle against the Strip is Thomas Duffy 
(Hon. MA '81), director of Yale's bands and adjunct 
professor in music analysis at the Yale School of Music. "Last 
year, in conjunction with a number of the students in the band, after 
having been pelted with food and drink and after having-what 
shall I say-dealt with this issue for many years, l decided enough 
was enough and that the band was going to relinquish the honor of 
accompanying the Strip in favor of some more musically spirited 
tunes," Duffy says. Not used to seeing controversy arise over his 
direction-the Yale Winter Wonder Band and the Yale Chamber 
Winds don't often make the headlines of the campus press-Duffy I
talks about the situation in well-measured sentences most likely 
recapitulated from conversations with confused undergrads looking 
for answers. "It was quite obvious mid-season that this was 
ridiculous. Our drum major was covered with food, and it's just not 
a musical event. If these Saybrook folks want to take half their 
clothes off and pretend they're naked, fine, they can do that, but as 
far as committing a prime playing opportunity of the band to 
that ... the time has passed!" 

Duffy also reflects on his moral qualms regarding the Strip. "You 
know, what a wonderful tradition in this day and age--with how 
many people in the world without food?-Yale students, the nation's 
future leaders, throwing food at people who pretend to take off their 
clothes. It's a little puzzling and kind of hard to justify." 

Sick of instruments clogged with mayo, not to mention the 
larger matters of international conscience, Duffy wrote a short note 
last January to outgoing Saybrook Master James Thomas (LAW '64) 
stating that the band would no longer accompany the Strip. This 
was to be the death knell for the Strip as we know it. However, with 
the 1995-96 football season long gone and best forgotten, and 
Saybrook scheduled to welcome Antonio Lasaga as its new master 
for the Fall 1996 semester, the matter never made it into public view.
