**Title: Republicans Get Back in the Ring**
**Author: Alex Funk**
**Page number(s): 8-9**

Rolling with the punches, the Yale College Republicans are using this year's
presidential election to build an organization on staunchly Democratic turf.

Election '88: We turn our backs on the former captain of the
Yale baseball team in favor of a short, squawky-voiced Harvard
boy who happens to share some of our political views. Though
the rest of the country overwhelmingly prefers George Bush
(DC '48), the undergrads at his alma mater cannot overlook his
conservative leanings. In an election with the lowest national voter
turnout in recent history, four out of five Yalies vote against him.

Election '92: We spurn our home-grown son again, though this
time, more reasonably, we vote for a Democrat who has shown the
good grace to attend Yale Law. He is also a Democrat that can
campaign. In Bill Clinton (LAW '73) we trust: we Rock the Vote, rally
in Battell Chapel, mobilize for National Student Mobilization Day,
listen to Hillary (LAW '73) on the New Haven Green. We Vote For a
Change and a change we get: the first Democratic President in 12 years.
The fact that he is a Yalie is less important than the fact that he is a
Democrat; most of us here are ecstatic about both. ·

Election '96: Yale helps re-elect Bill Clinton to the white House.
The script is already finished. Thanks to the modern obsession with
polling, we know that only a serious blunder by Clinton, or a major
switch in public opinion, could put Bob Dole in the White House on
November 5. The ex-majority leader of the Senate trails Clinton by a
substantial ten-point margin nationally, and a Yale Daily News poll
indicates that the gap is roughly 50 points here at Yale. It is different,
however, than it was four years ago, when Democratic activism was
prominent and constant right up to Election Day. Yalies are content
this year to sit back and watch, confident that their candidate needs no
more than the votes he already has to return for a second term. No Vote
need be Rocked, no Change solicited, thank you very much. Seventy
percent of the campus is more or less happy to extend the Yale clinch
on the White House to 12 years.
Is Yale a Democratic campus? Is the macarena just a fad?

As election years go, it has been a quiet one at Yale. No memorable
rallies, no campus visits by candidates, no special "ongoing series" of
election articles in the YDN. Relative to 1992, we are asleep.
David Cook QE '99), a Yale College Republican,· tried to stir
things up with a September 25 guest column in the YDN, calling Yale
a "campus of knee-jerk Clintonians" and daring his classmates to join
"the best party on campus," the Yale College Republicans. Nobody
publicly took issue with the first statement, and as to the invitation, I
may have been the only one to respond, albeit indirectly:
Suffering from voter apathy, I decided that the "best party on
campus" was just what I needed for a political shot in the arm. In all
honesty, I figured that the Democratic Party might be more up my
alley, but to be fair, I looked into both. Besides, you have to root a little
bit for the underdog, even in politics. I'm not talking about Dole here,
but about the Yale College Republicans. To me, their name sounds like
an oxymoron. My friend Blake likens them to Bengal tigers: fierce and
deadly, but so rare that you want to check in from time to time and
make sure they haven't all vanished. Not having heard much from any
Yale College Republicans recently, I thought it'd only be fair to check
them out and see if they were for real, leaving open the possibility of
having my opinion reshaped.
About politics. Not partying.

John Mihaljevic (DC '99) is tall, dark-haired, and president of the
Yale College Republicans. Like so many people in high-profile
political positions, Mihaljevic is careful to repeat certain buzzwords
in conversation, especially when that conversation is with
somebody who may be writing a magazine article. His current
word is "activism," and if you talk to. him enough, you begin
to develop the mental image of a handful of nearly ragged
individuals, exhausted to their conservative-but-mainstream
marrow by an endless flurry of campus and community
activiry.
These are the Yale College Republicans, and to be honest,
