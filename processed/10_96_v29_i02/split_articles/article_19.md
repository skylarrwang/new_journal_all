T
he whiteness of the smooth inner skull appears, followed 
by the first of 124 slices of a child's brain, each 1.2 
millimeters thick. The slices pile on quickly, creating the 
sensation of a movie, building onto themselves as the 
little boy's brain is constructed. The sagittal cuts reach the midline, 
which is the profile of the human face and the brain it 
encompasses, and then quickly pass to the outer edge just inside 
the ear and temple, the folds of brain briefly visible before being 
surrounded by the protective skull. The picture resembles a science 
fiction plan for constructing artificial intelligence. On the 
computer screen, the image's motion gives the brain a tangible 
quality, as if this object moving towards the viewer could be lifted 
into reality and disassembled mechanically as easily as it has been 
assembled electronically. The screen to the right of the one 
displaying the brain receives new instructions and the little boy is 
told through the intercom: "Max, all set for the next set of 
pictures. Same type of noise, same length of time, same 
instructions. Don't move at all; talk to you in a bit." The churning 
begins again as a current runs through the wires of the imager, 
bumping against the wires' sides, and the next pictures are 
collected. 

"Yes! What a good little boy!" Dr. Bradley Peterson says as the 
previous image finishes appearing on the screen. "I'm always in 
such a good mood when the sagittal comes out." Peterson, a 
researcher in his mid-thirties, hops around behind the screens, 
grinning in glee and relief. To construct a complete image of the 
brain, the patient must hold his or her head absolutely still for 
twenty minutes. Although such a task is relatively easy for the 
average adult, who often falls asleep during that time, scanning a 
child is always a gamble. A child finds it difficult to hold still for 
that long, and any movement returns an image containing lines. 
Holding completely still is even harder for a person with Gilles 
de la Tourette's syndrome. Peterson's study attempts to capitalize 
on this magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology to study 
Tourette's in both adults and children. A little boy Max's age would 
have difficulty lying still because of his tics-involuntary, sudden, 
recurrent movements or vocalizations. Although most people 
associate Tourette's with an individual who swears or makes 
obscene gestures uncontrollably, this occurs in only 10 percent of 
cases. A simple motor tic can appear as eye blinking, neck jerking, 
shoulder shrugging. Simple vocal tics include coughing, throat 
clearing, sniffing, grunting, and even barking. More complex vocal 
tics can be the repetition of words or phrases out of context.

Studying Tourette's syndrome represents an avenue by which to 
explore the vague boundaries between voluntary and involuntary 
behaviors. Everyone has compulsions to speak out at certain times 
or touch things that they know should not be touched. What keeps 
us from following through on those impulses? The MRI 
technology that Peterson uses may allow us to pinpoint where 
control of these actions resides in the brain. For an individual with 
Tourette's syndrome, the urge to tic persists until the action is 
performed. Individuals with Tourette's compare this feeling to an 
attempt to keep from blinking; eventually, the effort breaks down, 
and a person blinks. 

A nine-year-old boy describes his struggle with the disease 
during an interview with a child psychiatrist at the Yale Child 
Study Center, which is a world leader in the study of the disease 
and also Peterson's workplace. As the little boy plays with model 
soldiers, he says that his Tourette's is like the bad soldiers. The 
good soldiers at first beat and kill all the bad soldiers, just as the 
little boy can fight off his tics for a while. However, when all the 
bad soldiers are finally dead and the battle seems won, they rise up 
again and begin to beat the good soldiers. As he finishes this 
description, the little boy spins around to his left, touching the 
table behind him twice before spinning forward, looking up at the 
ceiling twice, and returning to play with his soldiers. 

F
or much of the twentieth century, experimental psychology 
focused on human behaviors. The brain was treated as a 
black box, inaccessible to scientists for explaining human 
actions. Tourette's syndrome was not appreciated as an organic 
imbalance or oddity in brain structure; it was treated as a mental 
disorder. The swearing and obscene gestures were viewed as 
residual developmental difficulty. Psychotherapy, however, has little 
impact on controlling tics in Tourette's. 

In the 1960s, scientists began to construct information 
processing models to explain how the brain is used when one 
thinks and how thinking is organized. This research was done 
mostly in animals, where specific lesions in the brain could be 
made. The animals' subsequent behavior was recorded and 
afterward their cerebral anatomy was studied further. In humans, 
much of the science focused on autopsy studies of people with 
specific behavior disorders. However, the trauma to the brain 
caused by death made the visible damage a poor indication of 
functional problems. Damage could have occurred from the way 
the person died or the aging process. The new MRI. technology 
., 

allows a healthy child to be interviewed, 
tested, and then, within a few hours, to 
have his brain measured and studied. 
Phrenology, the nineteenth-century belief 
that bumps on the skull correlate to 
personality types, has long been 
abandon~d. Yet scientists peering at the 
reconstructed brain image on the computer 
screen feel a certain kinship to that research 
of a century ago. They no longer crudely 
measure bumps, but they measure brain 
structures that govern human actions. 
When Peterson arrived at Yale in 1990, 
the MRI technology was available, but no 
one was using it to identify the specific 
changes in brain sfructure associated with 
neurological diseases. "I was amazed that 
MRI allowed us to study the brain 
structure of living children safely," Peterson 
says. "But no one at Yale was doing that 
kind of work. It was very hard at first; I 
had to feel my way blindly." Peterson now 
directs the Tourette's ·syndrome MRI 
project. He has recruited 160 children for 
the study, about 80 with Tourette's and 80 
who are normal controls. Before MRI 
technology was invented, there was little 
hope that brain sttucture changes 
associated with Tourette's would be· 
pinpointed. Because Tourette's is a 
childhood disease, 
decades often passed 
between 
the 
recording 
of tic 
symptoms and the 
death of indi-viduals, 
when the brain could 
be exam-ined. "There 
were only two good 
au-topsy cases for 
Tour-ette's," Peterson 
says. Now, 
using 
MRI, Peterson's study 
alone has produced 
the equivalent of 160 
child autopsies. 
When a child first 
arrives for scanning, 
he is interviewed, 
along with his par-
ents, to determine the 
severity of his Tour-
ette's. He is then 
taken to the MRI 
center at Yale-New 
Haven Hospital, which sits in the base-
ment of the medical school in a building 
adjacent to the Child Study Center. The 
machine used by Peterson is run by Hedy 
Sarofin. Sarofin sits on a high stool in front 
of the three screens which control the MRI 
scanner and display the images it captures. 
From her perch she gazes through the large 
panels of glass onto the MRI machine in 
the adjacent room. The door leading to 
that room bears warning signs in orange 
lettering, telling those who enter to remove 
all metal or magnetically coded objects 
from their bodies. Credit cards, for 
instance, are erased in the MRI room 
because the room is magnetized. Metal 
objects are tugged gently by the magnetic 
field; clip-ons might fly off women's ears, 
becoming dangerous projectiles. 
The room is off-white and the MRJ "' ~ 
machine dominates the space. Coils of 
magnet are contained in a large, beige 
plastic arch about two meters long with a 
table extending from it. The child walks 
into the room with his parents and sits on 
the table. He is given ear plugs to mute the 
loud churning of the machine. He lies 
down, resting his head in a helmet. His 
head is braced on either side by padding 
inside the helmet, which.concains the head 
coil. Attached to the helmet is a visor with 
a mirror, angled so that without moving his 
head the child can see his father who 
stands holding his feet for reassurance. His 
legs rest over two pillows to make him 
comfortable and his body is wrapped in 
blankets for warmth. A small piece of tape 
runs across his forehead and chin, 
anchored on either side to the head cradle. 
These can easily rip when tugged, but they 
help assure the patient that his head is not 
moving involuntarily. The motorized table 
moves the child into the bore of the 
magnet, which is typically 70 centimeters 
in diameter; the inside of the arch contains 
an intercom through which Sarofin can 
give updates on the scanning agenda. 
What is happening to the little boy as 
he lies as still as he can inside the magnet? 
In MRI scans of the brain, it is mainly the 
hydrogen in tissue water that is being 
imaged. When the child enters the 
magnetic field, the hydrogen atoms in his 
body align with the field in the same 
manner as a compass aligns with the earth's 
poles. 

The frequency at which the hydrogen 
nucleus oscillates in a magnetic field is its 
"resonant frequency." It is similar to the 
frequency of a compass needle rocking 
back and forth in the 
earth's magnetic field. 
The compass can be 
stimulated to rock by 
tapping its glass cover 
case; the nucleus of a 
hydrogen atom is 
stimulated by sending 
pulses of radio waves 
at the tissue. When 
the waves are at the 
appropriate frequency, 
the hydrogen atom is 
excited. It then falls 
back into the original 
magnetic field, emit-
ting waves that can be 
detected by a short 
wave-radio antenna 
and receiver in the 
head coil. As with the 
compass needle, the 
resonant frequency of 
the stimulated hydro-
gen is proportional to
