the external field strength. For the 
compass, the frequency of the swinging 
motion increases as it is carried up the 
magnetic gradient from the equator toward 
the North Pole, where the magnetic field is 
stronger. A person can locate where he or 
she is in the world by the amount of 
rocking and where the needle points. In 
MRI, the scanner creates artificial 
gradients. The gradient field strength 
changes in a well-defined manner from 
place to place in the brain as it is being 
scanned. The location of the hydrogen in 
the body can be determined from the 
resonant frequency, since that correlates to 
the gradient field strength. 

The MRI scan is the equivalent of 
freezing a head, cutting it into transverse 
slices, then physically cutting it into tiny 
square cylinders. Each 1 millimeter 
cylinder occupies a known position in the 
original slice. The computer measures the 
amount of hydrogen in the brain tissue 
water in each cylinder and shows them as a 
particular brightness on the computer 
screen in proportion to that amount. To 
produce a usable picture, the computer 
carries out a classical mathematical 
maneuver known as a fourier transform. 

W
th the scanning completed, the 
child's brain is stored on an 
optical disk, which is similar to 
a compact disc, . and moved to the 
diagnostic radiology imaging center on the 
fifth floor in a different wing of the 
medical school. Far from a morgue, this 
aseptic room filled with high-tech 
computers holds on its optical disks the 
equivalent of hundreds of human brains in 
jars. 

Joel Klein (ES '96) was working on the 
Peterson 
project 
as 
a 
computer 
operationalise last spring. He measured the 
structures and created, with Peterson and 
Larry Staib, a computer programmer, the 
algorithms to put these images to their best 
use. People involved with MRI tend to be 
young. Older researchers have more 
difficulty wrapping their minds around the 
new technology, combining an under-
standing of medicine with computer 
programming. The change in technology 
has transformed the technicians from 
biologists and anthropologists to 
radiologists, physicists, electrical engineers, 
and diagnostic radiologists. Slicing the 
brain no longer requires a steady hand and 
knowledge of tissue differences, but an 
understanding of computer language. 

"This work has applications to robot 
vision," says Joel. "If you want a robot to 
walk down a hall and turn left at the next 
door, it needs to find the door. Just as it 
must extract the door from the 
surrounding features, we want to extract 
the corpus from the brain." 

Joel sits with the large computer screen 
in front of him, rolling back and forth on 
his chair and whistling quietly to the 1970s 
tunes coming from the radio on his right. 
He is the classic image of the cocky, young 
computer jock. The computer in front of 
him is named "Fovea," after the portion of 
the eye with the keenest perception. A long 
vertical rectangle on the screen has lists of 
commands that Joel enters in his attempts 
to run the measurements he desires. 

"What I am interested in right now is 
trying to figure out how big the ventricles 
in this kid's brain are," Joel says. He moves 
his cursor to the long, vertical window and 
types "analyze" at the prompt. This· starts 
Analyze, th e compu.ter program that 
reconstructs the brain in 3-D on the 
screen. In a flash, the Analyze logo appears 
followed by a dark blue screen with files 
holding commands. With a few more spins 
of the mouse, Joel opens a file holding the 
sagittal cuts of one patient. The skull and 
the fluid that bathes the brain have been 
removed, leaving a clean profile slice. 

Major structures are easily visible by their 
color differences, such as the corpus 
callosum, which is very light gray in 
comparison to the structures surrounding 
it. Other structures are visible to Joel's eye 
from his knowledge of brain markers, 
equivalents to the north star when one is 
locating constellations in the night sky . 

"There is a lot of fluid called 
cerebrospinal fluid that basically bathes the 
brain and surrounds the skull," Joel says. 
"There are also channels or rivers of fluid 
that run in very distinct, discrete regions of 
the brain called ventricles." In some 
diseases, in particular Tourette's syndrome, 
these ventricles are enlarged, as they are in 
people with Alzheimer's disease. Peterson's 
group believes that a degenerative process 
occurs with Tourette's syndrome, 
diminishing some parts of the brain, 
leaving behind the larger ventricles. 

Measuring the spaces between areas of the 
brain, however, is not as simple as pulling 
out a ruler or telling the computer to "go." 
To take measurements, Joel wants to use a 
3-D morphology program to first plug the 
little holes that appear as little yellow spots 
in the ventricles, making the pixels of a 
structure into a uniform intensity. He then 
plans to subtract everything from this 
plugging operation, leaving the ventricles 
behind. 

"It won't let me do 3-D morphology on 
this," Joel mutters. "Why is that?" Much of 
the time the technician or programmer is 
struggling to get the available sofrware to 
do what he or she wants it to do. 'We can 
say, for instance, we want to measure the 
ventricles and then the whole trick of this 
is persuading the software to actually do 
that, Joel says. 

Taking a tour of the brain, Joel runs the 
cursor around the image pointing to the 
major landmarks. "The corpus callosum is 
historically an important structure," Joel 
says. The corpus is an enormous band of 
tissue t hat bridges the left and right 
hemispheres of the brain. The Peterson 
study believes that the shape and size of the 
corpus callosum may be one distinguishing 
factor in subjects with Tourette's syndrome. 

"We believe that especially the frontal 
portions here, this part that is sort of 
bulbous, may be important in attention-
related tasks and tasks of motor 
movement," Joel explains. If Peterson's 
study can successfully pinpoint where the 
difficulty in controlling actions resides, 
interventions to control diseases in which 
people lose control, such as Tourette's, 
might be more successful with fewer side 
effects. Peterson believes, though, that 
Tourette's more likely affects many brain · 
regions; especially with more complicated 
behaviors, such as volition, control will 
probably reside in numerous locations 
around the brain. 

T he advances that this research has 
allowed are more fully appreciated when 
compared to the techniques of only a 
decade ago. "The big landmark study of 
the corpus callosum was of nine men and 
five women," says Joel. Obtaining that 
number of usable autopsies is difficult. The 
1982 study, by Columbia University 
anthropologists Christine de Lacoste-
Utamsing and Ralph L. Holloway, 
published in Science, concluded that the 
back of the corpus is more bulbous and 
larger in women than men. The Peterson 
group has proven th em wrong. The 
techniques of little over a decade ago seem 
archaic compared to the precision of the 
computer measurements. In the old days, 
when the brain was first removed from the 
head, its soft tissue was suspended for three 
weeks in a solution containing saline and 
other chemicals to ensure that the brain 
retained its original shape. "They literally 
would slice the brain in half, slap down the 
corpus on paper, hope the paper didn't get 
too wet, trace it, blow it up on a slide 
projector on a big wall covered with paper, 
and use that to compare volumes," Joel 
marvels with the confidence of one who 
has found a better route. Once the brain is 
sliced, it could not be resliced or used 
again. "We are doing an in vivo study here, 
meaning the people are still alive," Joel 
says. "So, we can give them other tests and 
gather pharmacological information from 
blood samples. The computer is just so 
much more accurate, and, of course, far 
less invasive." 

T he MRI techn ology th at Joel so 
comfortably plays with may give us a new 
window onto the effects of our actions and 
a new understanding of why we do what 
we do. Localizations of behavior to brain 
regions in diseases such as Tourette's will 
lead us to a better understanding of normal 
behavior and development. T he folds of 
the brain reveal a person's experience, just 
as rings on a tree reflect the plant's history. 
An alcoholic often has enlarged ventricles, 
appearing as larger gaps between folds, 
while a pianist has a larger region that 
sends messages to the hands. As Max leaves 
the MRI center, a visual copy of his brain 
remains on optical disk. H is body contains 
no visual trace or scar, yet his brain can 
now be disassembled and dissected. His 
brain may provide insight into his actions 
and predict his future, if we can learn to 
unscramble the code.
