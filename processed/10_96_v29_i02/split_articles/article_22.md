**Title: It's Like Butter**

"There's a fucking stick of butter walking around," said 
Conan O'Brien, laughing and shaking his head. "It's like 
something we'd make up on the show." 

It might as well have been television at the celebrity 
softball game at Yale Field on September 21. Familiar faces 
from the boob tube abounded, and the bright overhead 
lights and sedate audience gave the small stadium the 
atmosphere of a TV studio. The cast starred O'Brien, 
Patrick Ewing, Tom路 Brokaw and a slew of other 
individuals of varying degrees of fame, each of whom 
acted the role of hero-as-fund-raiser for Connecticut's 
Special Olympic athletes. 

Like most everything on TV, this night didn't 
feature a great deal by .way of plot, but the game itself 
was not without excitement. In the 路 second inning O 'Brien 
ripped a line drive up the middle, which UConn Husky point- 
guard Jen Rizotti turned into a diving double play (O'Brien 
acknowledged his defeat with an elaborate on-field bow 
towards Rizotti). John Starks, the New York Knicks guard, 
made a great grab in center field to steal an otherwise certain 路 
double. And Mike Lupica, New York's p rominen t sports 
columnist, treated the crowd to some aggressive base-running 
when he tried to stretch a double into a triple, even though he got 
naHed at third. 

Even without any gut-wrenching drama, the night's 
programming was noteworthy because of the cast, and what the 
celebrities assembled indicated about the setting. For most of the 
celebrity participants, New Haven is just New York's 
northernmost suburb. Jump in your limo or your Pathfinder at 
Rockefeller Center, and in an hour-and-a-half you're on Whalley 
Avenue. But while the celebriry faces temporarily lent Big Apple 
glitz to Yale Field, the evening also featured reminders that New 
Haven isn't New York, and that the Elm Ciry has an ill-defined 
but undeniable identiry of its own. 

Like all minor league cities, New Haven has a prominent 
mascot, responsible for distracting the spectators from the poor 
qualiry of play that characterizes minor league ball. On this night, 
Rally Raven, New Haven's 6-foot tall black bird, entertained the 
crowd between innings by challenging fans to dizzy-izzy foot-
races: competitors placed their foreheads on top of baseball bats, 
spun around the bats until dizzy, and fell all over 
themselves as they attempted to run to the finish line. 
The fans loved it. 

For Ravens games, Rally Raven is usually able to work 
the sidelines on his own, but since the celebrities 
promised to be a tougher bunch than minor leaguers, an 
elite corps of mascot reserves had been called up for 
cameo appearances. Enter Supercow, a large bovine with 
a giant S above her udders, there on behalf of Guida 
Dairies, a local milk supplier and big supporter of the 
Special Olympics. Supercow entertained fans by dancing 
the macarena on top of the first-base dugout. 

But without a doubt, the star of the mascot 
triumvirate, and the most ludicrous, was a giant stick of 
butter plodding slowly around the field. To promote its 
product, the Keller Butter Company dressed someone in a 
large off-white box with two eyes and a big smile, decorated 
with a blue ribbon. The mascot stole the show. 

The appeal路 of the evening's star-studded cast is obvious. 
The fans, who paid $7 to support the Special Olympics, 
were hoping to get a closer look at celebrities that they usually see 
only on TV. This was a chance for New Havenites to touch the 
untouchables. Yet in the midst of aU these celebrities, why did 
fans still cheer for a dizzy-izzy race and a dancing cow? 

On the sit-com that is the American ciry, New Haven is the 
family pet, the likable and well-known underdog that lacks the 
full-fledged glitz of the show's star. A stick of butter, a dancing 
cow, and a silly bird wouldn't stand much of a chance at Yankee 
Stadium, but in New Haven, this kind of small-time hokeyness is 
acceptable. New Haven may be big and cosmopolitan enough to 
draw major celebrities like O'Brien and Brokaw, but it is also. 
small and intimate enough that inane mascots can upstage prime-
time personalities. 

New Haven is a ciry in limbo, caught somewhere between 
New York and Mayberry. On the night of the celebriry game it 
was easy to pretend that every night in New Haven resembles a 
TV show. But for the rest of the year, it's nice to walk down the 
street and know that you're less likely to see a celebriry than you 
are to see your TA, your friend, or for that matter, a walking stick 
of butter.
