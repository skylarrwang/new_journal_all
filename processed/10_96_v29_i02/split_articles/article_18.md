assured me, "There is no fear that the Yale-
China Association will leave. We've functioned 
quite successfully in [the People's Republic of] 
China for 16 years." Barring some unforeseen 
catastrophe-"and we're not anticipating 
anything of this sort," she added quickly-
Yale-China plans to adapt and persist. 
She admitted that change to the academic 
environment is inevitable; the same 
cosmopolitan environment and hands-off 
colonial government that account for Hong 
Kong's business success also foster its often 
overlooked intellectual community. The Yale-
China classrooms on the mainland function 
rather free of interference, notwithstanding the 
ever-watchful eyes of the 11-year-old Party 
monjtors installed in every classroom. But of 
late, China has intimated its discomfort with 
what goes on in the Hong Kong classrooms. 
Last summer, Chinese students planning to 
attend the Yale-China American studies 
program in Hong Kong were refused 
permission to leave the mainland. While never 
told explicitly why this decision was made, 
Yale-China officials do not believe that the 
issue was their curriculum. Students from 
Taiwan and Hong Kong were also to attend. It 
seems China saw the students from Taiwan, 
which Beijing considers a rebel state, and 
those from Hong Kong as potentially 
corruptive to the mainland students. 
More than most, Chapman is aware of the 
cultural gulf between people who have lived 
their entire lives on the mainland and the 
cosmopolitan residents of Hong Kong. She 
was among the first group of Yale graduates to 
return to the old Yale-China facilities in China 
after normalization. Mter over 30 years of 
American-Chinese estrangement, the two 
cultures held one another in mutual 
fascination. That fascination still exists, but is 
more focused now. "The Chinese see the U.S. 
as the key to their own modernization efforts. 
America has captured the Chinese 
imagination as a land of opportunity, of 
vitality, and of creativity," Chapman says. Yale-
China's aim in the upcoming years is to 
facilitate communication between Americans 
and Chinese. Where formerly this was a literal 
proposition centering around basic English 
instruction, Yale-China's role is now more 
expansive. Hong Kong's metamorphosis into 
HKSAR provides a vast arena for cultural 
exchange which Yale-China hopes to referee.
