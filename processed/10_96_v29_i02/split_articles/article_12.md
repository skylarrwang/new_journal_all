I arrived at M&M Pawn Shop, located at 
the corner of Howe and George, co see what 
they had to offer-<lr more precisely, co find 
my stolen bike. Heaps of speakers, TVs, 
VCRs, drums, and furniture lined the walls. 
My eyes fell on the eight or so mountain bikes 
parked in a disorderly fashion in the side 
alcove of the room. One in particular-the red 
bike with the yellow "Giant" logo-grabbed 
my attention. A closer look revealed chat it was 
not "The One." 

Posing as an interested customer, I 
approached a clerk about purchasing 
procedure: "Do you ever have the problem of 
selling bikes chat have been stolen?" 

He lowered his chin, frowned, and shook 
his head vigorously. "No, never, because we 
register the names on a computer," he said. 
"You a Yale student?" 

"Yes." 

"Yeah, I've sold over 100 bikes since the 
beginning of the school year to Yale students." 

"What if someone wants to buy their 
stolen bike back?" I tried a new tack, doubting 
the truth in his response from the fuse time 
around. 

"Well, usually, they bring in a police 
report, and the police buy it back." 

Usually? 

Like many people, my bike was locked 
when it was stolen. For the first week of 
school, I was extremely scrupulous about 
locking it whenever I was five feet away. I had 
itÂ· chained to a lamppost in a well-lit area in 
from of the Law School, a high-traffic zone at 
any hour. It muse have taken a consummate 
thief co steal on Wall Street on a Thursday 
night between 8 and 11:30 p.m. After circling 
the campus several times that night in search 
of my stolen bike, I gave up. The bike was a 
lost cause; it was simply gone. 

The following morning I made my way 
(on foot) to the police station on Park Street, 
hoping they would have a sure-
fire method of bike recovery. 
Having told the officer on duty 
the details of my story, and the 
make and model of the bike, 
he told me he would file the 
case. 

"What does that 
mean?" I asked. 

"We file a 
report," 
responded. 

"And?" 
pressed 
further. 

"Well, the report is filed. We have it on 
fil " 
e. 

My crisis, from what I gather, is 
transformed into a square piece of paper (case 
No. 61731 co be exact) and added to similar 
papers in a file. The officer turned away to 
ruck No. 61731 into the file, but I broke in 
with an audacious, "So officer, what do you 
think the chances are of finding my bike?" He 
rolled his eyes, implying my naivete. 

Bikes stolen from the Yale campus are 
often sold to scores outside New Haven, 
making it hard for owners to track them 
down. But as I discovered, there is a huge 
market for stolen bikes at pawn shops even 
within New Haven. Selling over 100 bikes at 
prices ranging from $110-$115, it's not 
surprising chat places like M&M stay afloat. 

Maybe I can find consolation in the fact 
that I am not alone. One friend told me about 
someone who found his stolen bike at a pawn 
shop, had it stolen again, and found it at the 
same pawn shop a couple of days later. 

Another friend told me how she saw a van pull 
up to a pawn shop on Whalley and unload six 
bikes from the back. "You might want to sic 
outside and wait for yours to show up," she 
said. This may be the soundest advice 
I've gotten yet.
