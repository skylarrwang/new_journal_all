As Chin.ese rule quickly approaches, Yale seeks out its niche in post-1997 Hong Kong. 
ong Kong's Second Coming 
''Hong Kong is an entrep6c," I was cold before I set off 
for this spot of soil in the South China Sea. When I 
asked my French-speaking friends for a cranslacion of 
the word, I got no definitive answer. I have now 
become more familiar with the word than I ever intended. A few days of 
reading back issues of a Hong Kong newspaper alerts me that "entrep6t" 
is quite a buzzword here. It means, I gather, a liaison-ground. I imagine 
a bustling train stop, where cargo is unloaded, reconfigured, reloaded. 
Another person describes. the Hong Kong-China relationship for me 
with a similar metaphor: "We ace the shop window; they are the shop 
floor." 

Thoughts of straight-up, unadulterated consumerism are hard to 
escape in Hong Kong. No inch of space goes unused, and every aspect 
of life is for sale. At the stroke of midnight on June 30, 1997, Hong 
Kong will reven co Chinese sovereignty afrer 99 years of British colonial 
rule. Not even chis all-imponant date goes unexploiced as a marketing 
stratagem: T-shirts bragging fallen Union Jacks abound; one can smoke 
a "1997" brand cigarette; the posh Club 1997 and its diminutive 
neighbor, Post-'97, draw elbowing crowds. 

I weave through the streets, where unintelligible sounds perplex my 
ears, neon characters blur before my eyes, and flyovers-tra.ffic-jacnmed 
highways of dubious stability-streak above my head. Ailey markets 
thicken the air with the smell of fruit left too long in the sun. 
I am on my way to meet Bob Bonds (BK '71), the mastermind of 
the Yale Club of Hong Kong. I need a job, and as one eager to tap into 
my Yale connection, he is the man to see. His office is a cool relief to the 
hoc, diesely streets. There are stacks of papers everywhere: invitations to 
the upcoming Glee Club concen, glossy posters of Harkness Tower as 
viewed through a spray of magnolias, Yale Club of Hong Kong 
newsletters. A schedule of Whim 'ri Rhythm events tops one stack; they 
are coming to Hong Kong at the month's end, following on the heels of 
the Whiffenpoofs. The fax machine beeps, the telephone rings, the 
computer whirs through its database ofYalies. 

This jumble is the only tangible evidence of the existence of the Yale 
Club of Hong Kong. "No fancy building?" I ask. This is it, the 
conference-cum-storage room of Bonds' publishing firm. What began in 
1979 when 15 Yale alumni got together for lunch has grown into a 
network chat is hundreds strong. "I'd have co verify chis," Bonds tells me 
early on, "but the AYA [Association of Yale Alumni] says that we're the 
most active Yale Club outside the U.S." He types my name and address 
imo the computer, and I become member No. 207. 

"What's happening between Yale and Hong Kong is chat the two are 
getting tighter," says Bonds. More, and younger, Yalies are coming to
Hong Kong. In return, more local Hong Kong high school students are 
going co New Haven to attend Yale. In 1995, the Yale-China 
Association expanded co include a summer program in American 
studies for young East Asian scholars and professionals. 

Y
ale's burgeoning interest in China seems counterintuitive at first. 
At a time whe,!l the world is wary of Hong Kong's future, when 
the stock market here has suffered from several crises of 
confidence, when many large businesses have relocated, when such basic 
guarantees as freedom of the press lose credibility every day, it strikes me 
as odd that Yale should choose to dig in its heels. 

In America, calk of the handover is heavy with fatalistic doomsday-
speak. There is the perception that from the colony's cracked cocoon a 
new Chinese metropolis will emerge. Many imagine the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) populated with People's 
Liberation Army cadets and Communist Party cadres. The excitement 
this event is generating-hotels all over the territory claim no vacancy-
is not surprising. It is one of those rare moments of predictable history. 
And the circumstances are peculiar: a piece of land born of British 
imperialism, synonymous with capitalism, is to be engulfed in the great 
bosom of communism. 

But if one believes the Basic Law, drafted to bring HKSAR into 
existence, the region will maintain its own ideology and economic 
struCture. Despite promises of "a high degree of autonomy," HKSAR 
will be an indivisible part of the People's Republic of China. Ar least 
until the year 2047, when the Basic Law expires. 

Bonds assures me that he is nothing but optimistic about Yale's 
status in Hong Kong, and in Asia at large. Five years ago, two Hong 
Kong tycoons, who had come across Yalies in their business and 
intellectual circles, donated $6 million to be shared by Yale and the 
Chinese University of Hong Kong (which hosts Yale-China's Hong 
~ 
Kong program). The gift puts the South China region on the academic s
map by giving Yale an incentive to increase its interest in the area. In !l 
addition, Bonds notes, "East Asian activities are growing like wild 
grass. Yale would be foolish not to tap into chat." 

Several days afrer my encounter with Bonds-which did not result 
l:G>~:
in a job, but generated frequent invitations to Yale cocktai.l parties and ; 
boating trips. as well as solicitations to host Whiffenpoofs and Glee 
dub members-! meet David Youtz, field staff director for the Yale-
China Association. We sit in the tea room of the Mandarin Hotel, 
tucked among the buildings of Central Hong Kong's posrcard skyline. 

This district is the territory's hub of finance and fashion fanaticism. 
Like Bonds, Youtz radiates an enthusiasm for the future. "Yale-China is 
an 'old friend of China' kind of an 
organization," he reassures me. "1997 won't 
make any difference to us." 


n 1901, when prior Western contact with 
China had been largely mercantile, the

Yale-China Association set up shop in 
~ Changsha, Hunan Province. The small 
outcropping of buildings evolved into a vast 
educational complex composed of a medical

Western medical techniques. In return they 
learned Chinese. 

The Communist takeover in 1949 put a 
stop to all that; in 1950 Yale-China was 
summarily expelled from the mainland. By 
1954 Yale-China had regrouped and relocated 
in Hong Kong. President Richard Nixon's 
normalization campaign of the early 1970s 
resumed diplomatic ties between Washington 
and Beijing in 1979. The following year, Yale-
China returned to its old campuses on the
mainland. Throughout years of changing 
international politics, Yale-China maintained 
its Hong Kong branch. Accustomed to 
redefining its niche, Yale-China is pragmatic 
and resilient. Its directors view the upcoming 
change in Hong Kong as an opportunity 
rather than a setback. 

Youtz predicts that post-1997 Hong Kong 
will be a hotbed of East-West interaction, even 
more than it is today. Despite China'sÂ·efforts 
to control Hong Kong's population by 
enforcing tight borders between it and the 
mainland, an influx of Chinese is inevitable. 
And despite the hypochondriac worries that 
Westerners have for the market's health, 
Americans and Europeans eager to make a 
buck will still flock to the territory. Protocol 
for Yale-China in the coming years is to 
prepare Chinese students for a future full of 
Americans. Youtz laughs and comments, 
"Chinese students have some very weird ideas 
about what America is. They think that if they 
smoke Marlboro cigarettes and know about 
anything-goes capitalism they understand 
America." Surely such a warped perception 
cannot serve the business relations that are 
cropping up with increasing frequency 
between Americans and Chinese. 

Youtz speaks confidently about the 
ongoing, and intensified, need for Yale-China 
in Hong Kong. He reminds me of what I was 
told weeks ago back in New Haven. I visited 
the Yale-China headquarters-a small red and 
white colonial house at the corner of Temple 
and Trumbull Streets-to get some 
background information. Inside, I was 
surprised to hear the woman at the front desk 
chatting on the telephone in Cantonese: my 
first encounter with the syllables that would 
soon bewilder me. Nancy Chapman (BK '77), 
Yale-China's president and a graduate of the 
Yale-China program, popped her head around 
the corner. She conversed briefly with the 
woman, sliding easily into English out of 
consideration for me. 

In slighcly more impassioned terms, with a 
determination that makes Youtz seem almost 
casual, the otherwise soft-spoken Chapman
