EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Every so often I look up from my desk and see two photo albums 
sitting on my shelf, waiting patiently for an eager audience. The 
albums are filled with pictures of aquamarine oceans flooding 
onto Besh-colored sand, wet-eyed sea lion pups sniffing my 
fingers, and Maori carvings of men with tongues thrust between their 
teeth. The pictures serve as.memories of my semester in New Zealand, 
and also as proof that the days I recall from the Land of the Long White 
Cloud acrually happened. 

Before leaving, I daydreamed of the exotic life I would find in a 
foreign country-a Life so removed from Yale, I would hanlly recognize 
rhe land, the culture, or even myself. As it does for many students 
endeavoring to study abroad, the Yale bureaucracy tried to dissuade me 
from pursuing academics beyond Yale. Bur I remembered the words of a 
Princeton friend who spent a semester in Africa: "Lots of people who 
don't srudy abroad say they wish they had, but I don't know anyone who 
studied abroad who wished they hadn't." 

For years, I told myself I would miss nothing earth-shattering by 
leaving Yale for a semester. Bur when ir came down to packing up a 
dorm room of belongings and saying goodbye to everyone and 
everything on campus for nine months, I wondered whether I was doing 
the right thing. Was it stupid to leave now, when I had finally found my 
niche at Yale, had a group of good ftiends, felt like the things I do here 
matter? My friends will grow together while I drift away from them, I 
thought. They will change. I will change. Maybe we won't fit together 
anymore. I will be alone in a foreign country, starting from scratch. 

When I rerum to Yale, I might fed alone and have to start over again. I 
panicked. But I scuffed my backpack, heaved it onto my back, and took 
off on Qanras Flight 109. 

To months later I was taking off again, this time for the final 
segment of my program, the independent srudy project. Even 
with ten weeks in New Zealand under my belt. I felt nervous. I 
heaved my pack over my shoulders for the hundredth painful time and 
headed towards the bus stop. Alone. What bad I gotten myself into, with 
five weeks of solitary rravd and research ahead of me? 

After two weeks of research, however, I felt brashly confident, secure 
in the knowledge that I was a Yale student conducting significant 
research in a foreign country, independent of my home institution, my 
family, or any familiar surroundings. 

I was on my way to Nelson for phase two of my research, but the 
bus I hopped on this time was not trustwonhy. I should have been 
skeptical when I saw fifteen other sears, all conspicuously empty. Barry's 
Bus was dilapidated and near-collapse. Ten minutes into the ride, the 
engine surrendered to old age with a few mighty chugs and a clanking 
grand finale. The overweight bus driver turned to me and said in a thick 
Kiwi accent, "I hope you don't mind my company, because it looks like 
we'll be here for a while." I managed a cross between a smile and a 
grimace, wishing desperately that I had not been Barry's sole passenger. 

Now it was just me and the grinning bus driver who stood smoking on 
the roadside, with f.illing cigarette ashes catching on the shelf of his belly. 

I hopped out and began to consider hitchhiking, when along carne 
my knight in shining black Ford Explorer. To my chagrin, he had 
stopped because he knew the bus driver. My heart dropped in my chest 
as I heard them chatter, but when the man offered me a ride to the next 
bus station, I was quick to accept. We introduced ourselves and I told 
him I was headed to Nelson. He said, "Really? Me, too." My eyebrows 
lifted and my smile perked up. The next four-and-a-half hours were a 
blissful free ride up the rocky coast. Upon arriving in Nelson, we spent 
45 minutes looking for my youth hostd. We drove in circles around the 
city, trying desperately ro read the one-inch square map in the Nw 
aaland Backpackm' Handbook. When the man finally left me at the 
proper street comer, he would not even let me reimburse him for gas. 

In Nelson, I wandered the streets feeling more lonely than I bad in 
months. I had been in small New Zealand towns by myself, but this 
was a big city, at least by Kiwi standards. Small towns feel homey 
even when you don't know anyone. Big cities do not. As I passed clumps 
of people on the street, all I could think was that no one here knew my

name. More importantly, no one cared. 

I ducked into a coffee shop to calm my growing sense of despair. 
Pulling out my notebook, I noticed a man across from me staring at my 
work. "Are you a srudent?" he asked in a voice too loud and slurred for a 
coffee shop. I smiled, nodded, and huddled over my paper. "There's no 
point in doing all that work. It won't get you anywhere unless you have a 
Ph.D." With my Ph.D. nowhere in sight, I ignored his comment. But 
he needed no encouragement. "Do you got some Jewish in you?" he 
asked. "You got a big nose." 

I looked up at him and cringed in disbelief 
"You're beautiful, though," he said, nearly f.illing off of his stool. "I 
could love you." 

I shoved my notebook into my backpack, made a run for the door, 
and let my tears dissolve into the evening air. That night I walked back 
to the youth hostel with my pocket knife in hand, blade out and ready in 
case of emergency. I was not taking any chances. 

By the next night, I had moved to a youth hostel in a better part of 
town, completed successful research in the Nelson Public Library, 
booked a bus reservation to my next destination, and planned an 
excursion to glorious Abel Tasman National Park. The events of the 
evening before seemed long ago and far away. 

What had changed? I took comfort in the fact that I was learning to 
be alone without being lonely. 

In another two weeks I was in Gisbome, working with the Maori 
community liaison at the Department of Conservation. In my spare 
time I walked on the beach and scroUed about town. One Sunday night, 
l went to a live jazz show at a local restaurant. I was the only person there 
without a date, or at least a friend. I did not feel conspicuous walking in 
alone, bur I guess I looked odd to the twenrysomethings whose table I 
joined. They struck up a conversation and poured me some wine. Three 
bottles later we were having dinner next door and they were offering to 
take me out on the town. As we made plans for the foUowing evening, 
one said she was impressed that I had dared to go to the concert alone

Back at the youth hostel, the room was spinning as I called a friend 
from my program whose independent study project had taken her to a 
different destination. "What's wrong with you?" she asked. "Are you 
laughing or crying?" 

I slumped over the phone in a fit of drunken giggles. "Laughing," I 

Four months later, I made an entirely different kind of trip. I was on 
my way back to New Haven. I thought that returning to school 
after the summer break would prove insignificant. After all, 
everyone had been away from campus and had a relatively clean slate. 
But things feel different now. People look at me quizzically when 
they pass me on the cobblestones between classes. "I haven't seen you in 
a while," they say with raised eyebrows, as though I had been hiding in 
my room last semester. 

Those who know of my absence ask politely, "How was it?" But they 
seem discouraged when there is no pat answer. So, I have narrowed 
down my description to "it was great," which suits their expectations just 
fine. 

The friends and activities I left behind are still here, but some of my 
fears have come true: they have changed, and I have changed. In many 
ways, I am as alone here as I was when there were 13,000 miles, a 
continent, and an ocean between New Haven and me. 

And so what? My friends are still my friends, my activities are still 
my activities, Yale is sciU my university. I realized quickly that I did not 
miss anything life-altering by leaving campus. I also understand that it 
might take me a while to get my bearings again. But my friend from 
Princeton was right: bureaucracy aside, I hold no regrets about my 
decision. My photo albums may sit on my shelf without a rapt audience, 
but I know they are there. Looking at them by myself, I can be JW
