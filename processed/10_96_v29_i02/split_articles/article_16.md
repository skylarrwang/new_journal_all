T
he first indication that something would be different this 
year came during Freshperson Conference 1996 at idyllic 
Camp Laurelwood. Hundreds of freshmen were assembled in 
small groups according to residential college affiliation. These 
sessions were to be the new frosh's first exposure to the legend and 
lore that run through each college's history. 

"On the second night the band always comes," explains Eileen 
Yam (SY '97), a pod leader at this year's Conference. "So, that night 
all the Saybrook frosh were gathered, and we explained to them that 
tonight the YPMB is going to come and we're all going to strip 
when the band plays 'The Stripper.' We told them exactly how it 
was going to happen, how two minutes before we'll all yell 'shoes'-
the way we always do at the football games-then how we'd get up 
on stage and strip the way we always do, and the way it was when I 
was a freshman and I was on Conference. So, we went backstage, 
got ready to go on stage and got ready to strip, and the band just 
seemed confused. They played some songs and just never played 
'The Stripper.' Then they ran off. I figured that they were just 
pathetic and hadn't learned their music yet." Of course, these 
resilient Yalies didn't let this hardship stop them. "So, we just ran up 
on stage and stripped anyway without any music," Yam says. 

What Yam and all the attendees didn't know then was that the 
Strip would never be the same again. 
OCTOBER 11, 1996 

'' B 
and sucks! Band sucks!" screams Duane Campbell (SY ~ 
'98) sitting just over Gate l4B of the Yale Bowl during S 
the first home game of the 1996 Football season. ~ 
Nearing the end of the third quarter, Yale is down 35 to 6 against ~ 
their intrastate rival from the University of Connecticut, so any g' 
drama left on the field easily gives way to the drama unfolding in ~Â­
the bleachers. "Don't cheer for the band!" Campbell cries, trying to ;! 
rally his fellow Saybrugians to harangue the YPMB. The band has ~ 
moved from its regular position directly below Saybrook to seats ~ 
eight rows back and safely out of harm's way. As they g 
enthusiastically charge through another traditional number in an ~ 
attempt to drown out Campbell's shouts, he finally gets his fill of -
Sousa-inspired brass. Turning towards the band, face puffed up in 
anger, he yells, "Oh, just shut up!" 

As the third quarter nears, two defectors-YPMB members who 
also call Saybrook College their home-leave their places in the 
band and join their classmates in preparation for the Strip, music or 
not. 

As one of the students sheds her button-encrusted blue 
marching band blazer, a fellow turncoat exclaims with shock, 
"You're taking off the jacket!" 

"I'm taking it off," her stoic bandmate confirms. "I'm officially 
not part of the band for now. I'm with Saybrook." 


Speaking moments later on the 
condition that her identity be kept a secret 
("I don't want to make waves," she says), 
this tortured victim of a policy she did not 
create says, "Duffy's official position is that 
we're putting them on equal footing with all 
the other college traditions. We're not going 
to play anything. We don't want to come 
out against the band director. It's very 
political." 

Band announcer Brian Levinson (DC 
'99) says, "People have been asking me, 
'Dude, what's the story with "The 
Stripper?" Are you going to play it?' People 
throw food at the band. There will be no 
relenting." 

Two minutes before the end of the third 
quarter, Saybrook's nefarious plans for the 
Strip come to light. Saybrook has beeQ 
sending runners across the stadium on and 
off since half-time to negotiate with the 
UConn band to play "The Stripper." Their 
labors finally bear sweet fruit. "The 
opposing band is going to play the music 
for us!" exclaims Campbell. A quick martial 
chant of "UConn Band! UConn Band!" 
resounds from the assembled Saybrook 
students. 

But there is a slight_ snag. "OK They're 
going to try to play 'The Stripper,' but they 
don't have the music. So they're going to 
play something that matches the rhythmic 
structure of it," Campbell says. 

As the third quarter ends, the shoe is 
dropped, literally. Sneakers in hand, the 
Saybrook contingent drops its drawers just 
as the UConn band erupts into a rousing 
rendition of "Give Me Some Lovin'"-
indeed, a passable rhythmic match to the 
risque classic that usually accompanies the 
unveiling of Saybrook's pride and joy. 

The Strip continues ... for now. 

Flushed with their success with the 
UConn band, devoted Saybrugians are 
planning a loosely organized letter-writing 
campaign aimed at bands of opposing 
colleges, hoping they too, will play "The 
Stripper," or some other rhythmic 
equivalent, when they visit the Yale Bowl. 

((These are certainly hot-potato 
issues which the future of the 
institution does not depend 
on," President Richard Levin was quoted as 
saying in the Yale Daily Nws, begging off 
responsibility for mediating the struggle for 
the life of the Strip. 

But to the members of Saybrook 
College who are trying to maintain school 
spirit in an era of student apathy towards 
the residential college system, this is an 
issue on which the future of the institution 
depends. "They keep trying to keep people 
on campus, yet they're ending all the college 
traditions-which seems kind of crazy to 
me," says Eileen Burke (SY '97). vice-
president of the Saybrook College Council. 

It's hard to believe, but customs like the 
Strip at football games and nude runs across 
Old Campus during Future Freshmen Days 
are the only thing that prevent residential 
colleges from looking like more decrepit 
versions of the off-campus apartments that 
dot New Haven and that, increasingly, are 
the place to live if you want to avoid tiny 
rooms, communal bathrooms, and broken 
thermostats. 

If this university makes a habit of 
letting its traditions drop off one by one, 
who knows what will go next? Mter all, 
those dusty old Gothic buildings sure are a 
pain to keep clean.
