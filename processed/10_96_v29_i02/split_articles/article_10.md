**Buckley and Man at Yale**

Just imagine: on a weekly basis, you and 
11 other students "take part in a lively 
conversation about the art of prose" with one 
of the foremost writers in America, Wtlliam E 
Buckley, Jr. (DC '50). His college seminar, 
English Composition, is the sort of once-in-a-
lifetime opportunity that only a Yale education 
can provide. 

Or so the recruiters in the admissions 
office will tell prospective students next 
full. 

"Should we roll?" Buckley asks at 
the start of a recent class meeting. It is 
the fourth week of classes but this is 
only Buckley's second appearance. 

David comes to the front of the room. 
"I'd like to set up meetings, if I could do that 
today.'' David Southward (GRAD '97) is one 
of two assistants Buckley has recruited to help 
manage his class of 12, and he does a lot for 
the seminar. He selected the 12 students from 
the 107 applications; he reads their 
compositions; he meets with them to discuss 
the progress of their writing; he assigns their 
grades. The other assistant, Gloria Hardman, 
helps with the computer Buckley uses to 
project compositions onto. the screen. 

Buckley, sitting behind a laptop computer, 
leans back in his chair with his pen in his 
mouth-the classic Buckley pose. "Are we all 
here, David? Who wrote the essay? Sari?" 
Projected above the class is a computer screen 
divided into two columns: one for the 
student's composition, the other for Buckley to 
type his revisions. Buckley looks up; Sari 
waves. "Oh, hi. What essay was assigned for 
today?" he responds. 

The seminar is not likely to overload 
anyone's schedule. The weekly requirement is 
to 
write 
two 
250-word 
fictional 
compositions-on topics like "What I saw 
when the bus ran over the child" or "Brian's 
mother discovers a pornographic magazine in 
her 13-year-old's bedroom" (Buckley makes 
these up himself)-and revise a classmate's 
essay. Buckley assigns no readings, but he 
recommends the purchase of a style manual. 

Buckley dives into Sari's essay. It begins: "A 
crown of laurels rests on Charlie's head, the 
leaves bending over his forehead ... " Buckley 
comments, "Leaves don't really bend. How 
about, 'leaves lapping over'?" and he types the 
revision onto his side of the computer screen. 
Five minutes later the computer crashes. 
"What could be wrong? Do you know, 
Gloria?" Buckley asks. David and Gloria come 
over to Buckley and peer over his shoulder at 
the laptop. "We better reconstitute," Buckley 
annotinces. As soon as the computer system is 
back up again, Buckley gets back to business. 

The conversation quickly turns to the 
topic of punctuation. "The semicolon 
is very arbitrarily used," Buckley 
remarks. 

Later, 
he 
notes, 
"Parentheses are underused 
today." 

Buckley spends almost an 
hour on the first composi-
tion, changing a word 
here, a comma there. 
by 
calling 
him "gay boy." 

One of Buckley's 
first comments is, 
"If I was writing that, 
I would hyphenate 'gay 
boy.' It enhances the 
rhythm." 

The next essay 
tells the story of a 
fourth-grade bully, 
Justin, who tor-
ments Jeffy on 
the school bus 

He 
spends 
almost 
another hour on the second 
composition; the class time is 
nearly up. Buckley hurriedly runs 
through a third essay composition in 
the remaining 15 minutes. He asks 
David, "What do you want to do about 
my slow speed?" 

The only student compositions that 
Buckley looks at are the ones he gets to during 
class. One student in the seminar puts it this 
way: "You know Buckley only reads what he 
sees in class? What a joke. At first, I thought 
this would be this great thing, but now I just 
think it will be an easy credit." 

Some students are impressed with 
Buckley's seminar. After aJI, the class does 
expose students to the long-forgotten rules of 
punctuation and diction. One student claims, 
"I've learned how to write fiction from the TA; 
I've learned how to edit from the professor." 

However, one wonders if any other 
professor at Yale College. would get away with 
a teaching ethic like Buckley's. The appeal of 
the seminar certainly has something to do with 
the prominence of William E Buckley, Jr. "It's 
the only class I've taken at Yale that is just a 
cult of personality," a student says. 

After class, students gather around David, 
posing questions about meetings and handing 
in essays. Buckley is shown the way to 
Hillhouse Avenue where his chauffeured 
limousine waits to whisk him back to New 
York.
