Last semester, when trudging up Science 
Hill twice a week for my intro geology course, 
I always looked forward to eating lunch at the 
School of Management's (SOM) Donaldson 
Commons. The people were new, the lines 
were short, and most importantly, the food 
was so good that I even indulged in the 
occasional meat product. In the SOM dining 
hall you will never be driven to the salad bar 
by choices of soylada or cod nuggets on the 
hot line. No, at SOM, you are treated to brand 
names like Fruitopia, Dunkin' Donuts, and 
now, Sara Lee. 

Long associated with pastries, Sara Lee is 
expanding into the sandwich business. And 
my beloved SOM dining hall has wisely 
jumped on the Sara Lee deli meat 
bandwagon. Donaldson Commons now 
includes a brand-new Sara Lee Sandwich 
Shoppe, replete with a Sara Lee sign 
and matching uniforms for the Yale 
dining hall workers. As SOM 
dining hall manager Tom Sullivan 
says, "People want to see that 
they are eating a brand name 
food, they're willing to pay a 
higher price for premium 
quality food." Which begs the question: what's 
the quality of the food in che other dining 
halls? 

Before I could give my wholehearted 
approval to the Sara Lee Shoppe, I had co taste 
the sandwiches for myself Since most of the 
cold cuts had already run out, I settled for a 
sandwich with Honey Roasted Turkey Breast 
and cheese (which I later found out is not a 
Sara Lee product). Despite the imposter 
cheese, the sandwich was good by restaurant 
standards and exceptional by Yale standards. 
And, unlike a sandwich at a restaurant, mine 
was covered by the meal plan. 

It cook a lot of hard work for Yale co 
become part of the Sara Lee family. Chuck 
Bennett, assistant director of dining halls, 
explained to me that the only way Yale dining 
halls could be a part of this lucrative scheme 
was to enroll in Sara Lee's deli meat training 
program. A trainer came to Yale to teach both 
managers and staff the tried-and-true Sara Lee 
recipes and methods. Without this instruction 
Yale employees would not earn the right co 
wear the Sara Lee uniform. As an extra 
precaution, trainers installed photocopied 
diagrams of sandwiches beneath the counter. . 

I approached one woman behind the 
counter, who was sporting the requisite black 
and red hat and apron set. According to her, 
not everyone is thrilled about this new 
addition. Some of the workers at SOM, who 
asked to remain anonymous, complained that 
the new set up is more complex and the 
sandwich recipes are coo restrictive. 

But it seems chat Sara Lee is the wave of 
the future. Yale has finally come co the 
conclusion that the best way to improve Yale 
food is to stop serving it.
