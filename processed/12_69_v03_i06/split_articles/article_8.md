" ... healthy tolerance of strangeness and 
a healthy impatience with complacency" 
at which Brewster originally aimed the 
program. 

Their pre-packaged ideas burst in the 
face of reality: "I left the village thinking 
all sorts of marvelously deep Reader's 
Digest-type thoughts about 'timeless 
Africa,' "wrote Brian Sheehan after visit-
ing a village's sacred place. "A few minutes 
later we came across this naked old woman 
living in a tiny mud hut. Her most prized 
possession seemed to be a transistor radio 
which at that particular moment was 
blasting out 'Dance till the Midnight 
Hour.'" 

But their experiences abroad succeed 
not just in increasing their awareness of 
others. By escaping the frustrations of 
,1 
our educational system for a year, many 
of the Fivers have been able to see them-
selves more clearly. Perhaps because they 
1 are totally divorced from their own cul-
ture, they begin to question their relation-
ship to that culture. At work abroad, they 
find real independence possible and gen-
uine responsibility unavoidable. And 
those are two advantages the traditional 
Yale education has more often than not 
denied its students. 

The year-long time-out lets them put 
• · thoughts into proper perspective. The Five-
Year students return more convinced of 
their doubts about Yale and in their ideas 
for changing it. That conviction gave birth 
to their proposals. 

The Five-Year B.A. has succeeded for 
these students in expanding their horizons. 
But the university fails them in that on 
their return, it is incapable of handling 
those expanded horizons, providing little 
opportunity for their integration into 
course work. The luncheon proposals to 
Brewster attempted to alter this. 

"The thing many of us discovered 
abroad,'' explained Jay Fleming, who 
worked last year in Nepal, "is that educa-
tion-learning about oneself-proceeds 
whether you're in an educational institu-
tion or not. The changes we want would 
make every Yale student responsible for 
his own education." 

Most Fivers begin to believe in the over-
whelming importance of non-academic 
education. Away from the paternalism 
and the structured life of Yale, they must 
direct their own learning process. They 
are responsible to, if nothing else, them-
selves. The problem, as those at last 
Thursday's luncheon felt, is that" ... the 
restricted academic and social opportun-
ities encountered by Fivers upon their 
return to Yale have made it extremely 
difficult to capitalize on their non-academic 
experience.'' 

Brewster missed his mark in creating 
the Five-Year B.A. without simultaneously 
making major changes in the educational 
structure. Yale cannot expect a student 
who has spent a year organizing co-opera-
tive farms in Peru to forget that experi-
ence or even temporarily put it aside so 
that he can waste two years completing 
the impersonal requirements of a standard 
major. 

Yet the Five-Year B.A. Office claims 
that the student will not have to ignore 
his non-academic experience during h.is 
last two years at Yale. It promises" ... in-
dividual programs of study during junior 
and senior years specially fitted to their 
interests." 

In the statement which they presented 
to Brewster, these students claimed that 
the promise does not always come through. 
They criticized not just the "antiquated" 
criteria for Division IV, but also its im-
practicality: "Those who attempt to 
channel personal motivation and academic 
interest into a coherent educational pro-
gram encounter difficulty in finding sup-
port and supervision from the faculty. 
All too often the student's response is 
frustration and discouragement. He aban-
dons the pursuit of a personally more 
meaningful and stimulating course of study 
and passively allows himself to be 
channeled into existing academic struc-
tures." 

These problems cloud the success of 
the experimental Five-Year B.A. Pro-
gram. It has proven its worth while at the 
same time pointing out other means of 
i~proving Yale. Through such sugges-
tiOns as the proposals, the program has 
made itself a catlyst for university prog-
ress. Not only do the students benefit from 
a year of self-inspection, but, through the 
students, so can the university. 

When Kingman Brewster proposed the 
Five-Year B.A., he wanted it to reach the 
"considerable number of the young who 
yearn to become involved in something 
more meaningful than inherited patterns 
of success." He cannot do this unless he 
continues and extends this program to 
encompass a larger portion of the student 
body. Any student can now leave for two 
semesters of work. The university should 
begin encouraging students to do so-
some through a new Five-Year B.A. Pro-
gram, others on their own. The four-year 
college career is too arbitrary to be suitable 
for all students. 

At the same time, Brewster and the 
university must begin a revision of Yale's 
educational system so that no student, 
whether he can afford to take a year off 
or not, will find himself frustrated by a 
'protective' education. 

The first Five-Year students found it 
difficult or impossible to relate the world 
of Yale College to the one in which they 
spent their year abroad. The one seems 
totally unrelated to life, the other is as 
real as a begger sleeping on the streets of 
Calcutta. U his promises mean anything, 
Brewster must continue on a larger scale 
the Five-Year B.A. Program, which strives 
to merge and improve both these worlds 
in a rational program of learning. ~
