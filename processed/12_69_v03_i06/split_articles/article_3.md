c
ities are in fashion, and Praeger has 
rushed to meet the vogue by publishing 
Vincent ScuJiy's American Architecture 
and Urbanism. Happily, this publisher has 
produced not a fashionable coffee-table 
decoration advertising a concern for the 
"urban crisis" but a profound interpreta-
tion of the American landscape by Yale 
University's most popular lecturer and the 
nation's most creative architectural 
historian. 

Many of the readers of this book may 
think that its author is, in fact, simply 
responding to contemporary fashion by 
writing a book on "urbanism." After all, 
he writes that his thinking has undergone 
a "major change since 1961." However, 
those of us who have had the privilege of 
hearing Scully's lectures (as I have as 
auditor, student and fascinated listener 
since 1958) wiU know that many of the 
ideas in this new book have been present 
from the very beginning. They have only 
been sharpened in the light of travels to 
new places, exposure to new architectural 
personalities and acquaintance with new 
scholarship. Thus, Scully's trip to Russia 
has led to fascinating comparisons of the 
Capitol in Washington with St. Isaac's in 
Leningrad, the Municipal Building in New 
York City with Stalin's wedding cakes in 
Moscow, and Chicago's Tribune competi-
tion entries with designs for Izvestia. His 
visits to the Southwest have led to insights 
into the architecture of Pueblo villages. 
His exposure to Robert Venturi has re-
sulted in voyages along America's ever-
growing network of neon-decorated high-
ways. His reading of Gans, Tunnard and 
Tom Wolfe has taken him away from 
writing only about great monuments and 
led him to consider in this book the land-
scape of the slum, the suburb and the 
freeway. 

Though American Architectllre and 
Urbanism explores territory not yet exam-
ined when I first sat among the mesmerized 
auditors in I 00 Art Gallery, it is still fun-
damentally the same fascinating amal-
gam of scholarship, insight, humor and 
poetry that Vincent Scully presented to the 
students of History of Art 53 b. Then as 
now the major element was observation, 
not theory. Scully's major concern is for 
the forces shaping the American land-
scape. So, as he points out, while "many 
architects and critics in America and 
Englan.d" could depict the work of Mies 
van der Robe as " Renaissance architec-
ture," he could never simply equate Mice;' 
"simplified, pure, clean, generalized, 
reasonable, abstract" buildings with 
Florentine palazzi or colonial houses. 
Mies' buildings are just "not at all Renais-
sance in scale." Unlike critics who fit the 
history of architecture into neatly pack-
aged theories, Scully has been able to 
deepen his vision with time and not seri-
ously alter his perspective. He has been 
able to build upon the prior judgments of 
Giedion, Hitchcock and Johnson without 
being warped by their earlier prejudices. 
He can see colonial buildings as more than 
just the results of a building technology or 
sharpened versions of British prototypes. 

L
s new book, like Scully's earlier lec-
tures, goes beyond architectural history to 
a socio-cultural examination of the entire 
American landscape. It is a vision of "an 
archetypal colonial sense of uprootedness 
and partial alienation" that has resulted 
from the interaction of the land with its 
colonizers. Scully presents a restless people 
that has "always been the most adrift from 
precedent" and a culture that "has con-
sistently remained that of a frontier-at first 
physical, later a social and technological 
one." So it is not surprising that the open-
ing images in the book are automobiles, 
Indian tepees, and trailer camps. Further 
on he presents houses that are "above the 
land, not of it," Western main streets with 
their wooden false fronts and proletarian 
housing projects that have been created 
through a cataclysmic cutting away of the 
city fabric. This too is not surprising. The 
American landscape is not made up only of 
Jefferson's Monticello, Sullivan's Guaranty 
Building and Frank Lloyd Wright's "Fall-
ing Water." What is surprising is that 
Scully can bring us to see the interaction of 
great monuments with our desire for dis-
posable buildings that are both "new im-
proved" and "good old-fashioned." For 
example, Henry Hobson Richardson's 
suburban railroad stations are seen to 
combine: 

two qualities previously considered natural 
opposites: "classicism" and "romanticism," if 
one wishes to call them that. They also com-
bined the new continuity of space with weight 
and permanence of ma,ss: archetypes of move-
ment and stability synthesized. In all these 
ways they may be felt to have summed up the 
main conflicting aspects of modern, and 
peculiarly American, middle-class aspiration: 
to be fn.:e and protectttl at once. In the same 
sense they were both urban and suburban, 
place-fixing masses adjusted to expanding sub-
urban patterns along the commuting railroad 
lines. 

E
haps the most important aspect of 
Scully's recent thinking is his ability to 
reach beyond architectural history or even 
criticism of the physical landscape. He has 
begun to see the problems of art school-
trained architects trying to work as "social 
engineers," trying to alter both the land-
scape and the patterns of our culture. He 
vividly depicts their battles with lawyers, 
civil administrators and politicians "full 
of lies and dodges, with hearts like small 
stones." Though Scully understands that 
this is an unhappy confrontation, a con-
frontafion that is fundamentally wrong 
and that "clearly has to be reconsidered 
in terms of who does what for whom and 
who controls it," he never suggests that the 
architectural profession (now with its 
own "urban design"bureaucrats) has found 
a way to resolve this situation. 

If American Architecture and Urbanism 
were simply the summation of Vincent 
Scully's thinking to date, it would be an 
important book. It is more. It is a shatter-
ingly new approach to architectural histo-
riography. In many ways it reminds me of 
Stravinsky's Le Sacre du Printemps. Where 
Stravinsky's work is rooted in the art of 
Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin and Pushkin, 
Scully's grows from the work of Meeks, 
Mumford and D. H. Lawrence. Rimsky-
Korsakov's Le Coq d'Or is larded with 
satire. So it is not surprising that Stravinsky 
could describe the opening of his revolu-
tionary work as "a group of knock-kneed 
and long-braided Lolitas jumping up and 
down." Borodin's Polovtsian Dances get 
violent. Stravinsky has described the open-
ing of Le Sacre as a "frightful tumult." 
American Architecture and Urbanism in-
cludes the same combination of violence 
and satire. New Haven's Lee High School 
js seen as "a pillbox at the edge of the Hill," 
Yales's new Becton Engineering Labora-
tory as "a huge radio cabinet," Saarinen's 
girls' dormitory at the University of Penn-
sylvania as the "Chateau d'If outside, 
Blanche DeBois within," and the attempts 
at the monumentalization of Pennsylvania 
Avenue in Washington as "the garbled 
experiences of American architects as tour-
ists abroad." Like Le Sacre, this book is 
deeply poetic. The houses on the New 
Haven Green are "ships moored around" a 
central open space, Sullivan's Guaranty 
Building is a "vertical body standing on 
legs stretched and swelling with muscular 
force," buildings on the coasts of Massa-
chusetts and Maine are "weathered silver, 
floating like dreams of forever in the cool 
fogs of the sea." When the poetry and the 
satire come together we are made to see the 
Empire State Building as "a lonely dino-
saur" that "rose sadly at mid-town, highest 
tower, tallest mountain, longest road, King 
Kong's eyrie, meant to moor air ships, 
alas." These images are tightly condensed 
evocations of Scully's lectures. In a few 
words-describing the "darkly glowing 
squares of Froebel-decorated amber sky-
lights" in Wright's Unity Temple or the 
"canvas-covered Conestoga wagon" that is 
his Taliesen West-this book calls to mind 
those marvelously impassioned torrents of 
words and slides that made up Scully's 
lectures on these buildings. 

is no more a tr~ ditional work than was Le 
Sacre du Printemps. There are no chaplets, 
no section captions, no footnotes, just one 
continuous flow of images. The photo-
graphs are even repeated so the stream of 
consciousness does not have to be inter-
rupted by flipping back to earlier illustra-
tions. The pages of this book come together 
as Vincent Scully's invitations to a country. 
Like the American landscape, this work is 
a never ending stream of development. 
What could be more fitting for a study of 
"urbanism"? ~
