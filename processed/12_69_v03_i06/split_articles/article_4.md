If you live on 14th St., you know Elsie. Or Elsie. Or Elsie. 
by David Freeman 
When the winter smog hangs a little 
heavier and the paper flowers begin to 
blossom and the sounds of Spanish Christ-
mas carols fill the 3rd Avenue station on 
the Canarsie line, shopkeepers in the East 
Village and along 14th Street know that 
Christmas is coming and that Elsie, the 
14th Street swatter and dog lady, will be in 
bloom again. 

Christmas is the busy season for that 
sweet perennial scrawny lady with orange 
yarn hair and arms covered with tattoos, 
who spends her days leading her pack of 
dogs up and down the east end of 14th 
street, foraging through the rubbish piles 
and garbage cans, saying Elsie is her only 
name, "Elsie, just Elsie ... Elsie." 

Her dogs, she has three regulars and 
occasionally one or two temporary strays, 
are called Elsie, Elsie and Brownie. Why 
Brownie, a splendid if slightly ragged Irish 
setter, did not get in on the Elsies is a ques-
tion that Elsie (the lady) does not answer. 

The canine Elsies are mongrels of the 
common street variety, and all three 
are as skinny as their mistress and usually 
a good deal dirtier. 

Elsie and her dogs, like a French peasant 
and her hounds hunting for truffles, root 
through the side streets and doorways, 
foraging, but never taking anything. She 
just keeps turning over strange bits of cloth 
and half broken objects murmuring, "Now 
what the hell is this? What do we got 
here ... ?" searching for some private and 
probably half forgotten secret in the gar-
bage cans. 

Even if Elsie tends to leave trash alone, 
she does take bizarre liberties with pas-
sersby. She always carries a rolled-up 
newspaper under her arm which she uses 
as a club to swat strangers on the backside 
as they pass. The swat is no gentle tap but 
rather a sadistic smack, clearly meant to 
punish her victim. Happily for those who 
travel 14th Street regularly, Elsie only 
swats occasionally. Usually her targets are 
so stunned at the idea of being clobbered 
from behind that they respond in the best 
Manhattan tradition, and pretend it didn't 
happen and move away from the trouble as 
quickly as possible. 

One victim of an Elsie swat, a ruddy-
faced salesman in an ill-fitting tweed car-
coat, pushing a suitcase, on wheels, deco-
rated with a sleazy green wreath, did 
complain after Elsie whacked him. The 
salesman turned and yelled at Elsie, who 
always keeps walking as she swats, never 
breaking her stride. 

"Hey you! You bit me?" No answer 
from Elsie, and the salesman dragging his 
suitcasa chases her and grabs her arm. 
"Lego the arm," Elsie says softly. 
"You hit me? Why'd you bit me?" Elsie 
says nothing; the dogs relax on the pave-
ment in front of the Orange Julius at 14th 
and 3rd to watch impassively. 

Elsie yells in a rough staccato startling 
the salesman. "Hit you? You crazy or 
something? Just lego the arm." 

"Well somebody hit me. With a paper. 
You got a paper." 

"You're crazy. Ask anybody." Elsie 
turns to the crowd beginning to gather and 
to the patrons of the Orange Julius who

Company of Boston. 
stare indifferently, their faces distorted and 
elongated by the glass walls. 

"Did I hit him?" Elsie screams to her 
audience. "Did I? Did I? Did I?" The 
salesman senses the incident getting out 
of control. He mutters an ominous "Well 
somebody hit me," turns his suitcase sharp-
ly and heads back down 14th Street. Elsie 
wakes up Brownie and glides victoriously 
across the street to rummage through the 
cardboard boxes in front of the United 
Cigar Store. 

Elsie usually seems uncaring in her 
choice of victims, however, she occasion-
ally seems to be reacting to injustices or to 
some of the grossness that abounds in 
New York streets. One morning about 
nine Elsie, caressing a box of trash in front 
of Blimpies at 14th and 1st, looks up long 
enough to see two middle-aged women in 
long black coats. One is carrying a shop-
ping bag marked "Christmas greetings 
from John's Bargain Store," and the other 
is tugging at her ear. Both are jabbering 
at the top of their lungs. As she passes 
Blimpies, Ear tugger accidentally steps on 
Brownie's paw, and Brownie gives an 
uncharacteristic yelp. The woman either 
doesn't hear or chooses to ignore the dog. 
Elsie drops the roll of slightly soiled brown 
wrapping paper she has been fingering and 
follows the women across 14th Street. 

"He took a bum rap for her," from 
Shopping bag. 

"Yeah, I know," from Ear tugger. 

"On his own the dumb sonofabitch took 
a bum rap." 

"Yeah." 

"I'll kill the shmuck. He took a bum 
rap." 

As Shopping bag steps up on the east 
curb, Elsie pulls back a two week old 
rolled-up copy of the Times and swats each 
woman on the rear twice. Ear tugger turns 
around sharply ready {or battle, but Elsie 
treats her to the punch with another quick 
swat, a rare frontal assault. Brownie barks 
again. Ear tugger screams "muggers," and 
the two women disappear into the BMT 
stop at 14th and 1st. Elsie watches them 
go, smiling quietly, privately, and then 
marches away forgetting about Blimpies 
and the roll of wrapping paper. 

Elsie always dresses the same way, just 
more or Jess of it, depending on the season. 
At the moment her year-round black 
woolen stockings are pulled down over her 
swollen ankles onto the tops of torn 
blue tennis shoes. Her red cloth skirt and 
blouse are dotted with dabs of brightly 
colored paint and the pink moth-eaten 
cardigan sweater that is always with h~r is, 
for winter, wrapped elegantly across her 
back. The khaki knapsack she carries for 
the swag she never collects is slung over her 
shoulder like a purse. Elsie wears glasses 
with round plastic frames that sit easily on 
a slender red nose that is usually runny and 
decorated with cold sores. 

In warmer weather one can see Elsie's 
arms, and they are her outstanding feature. 
Each one is decorated with lush purple 
tattoos. On the left forearm there's a ven-
omous snake coiled around a long dagger 
dripping three perfectly shaped drops of 
blood. Her right forearm has a large dog's 
head-a purple Cocker Spaniel, with its 
tongue hanging out and a friendly looking 
eye. Below the dog there's a series of twist-
ing, intertwined almost psychedelic pat-
terns of purple ribbons winding down onto 
the back of a hairy hand. 

When Elsie wanders south of 14th Street 
into what's left of the hippie district, she 
pretends to ignore the crowds of kids on 
2nd Avenue between Gems Spa and The 
Fillmore-but the kids rarely ignore her. A 
few of the hippies have seen the Marx 
Brothers in "At The Circus," and when 
Elsie approaches they serenade her with a 
chorus from Groucho's famous song: 
Lydia, oh Lydia-
that encyclopedia, 
Lydia the tattooed lady. 
Oh say have you seen Lydia? 
Lydia's the queen of them all. 

E lsie enjoys the singing and the attention, 
and the hippies love to harmonize like 
a barber shop quartet. For a while a few 
months ago it looked as if Elsie might set a 
new style among the hippies. They talked 
about getting tattoos for themselves, but 
the plan fell through when nobody could 
find a tattoo parlor. Now they seem content 
to sing occasionally "Lydia the Tattooed 
Lady" to Elsie and to wave after her as she 
roots her way up to 14th Street. 

If some of the hippies have been watch-
ing G roucho, at least one of them has a 
more literary bent, and has read e.e. cum-
mings. The boy, a tall slender effeminate 
Negro in Levis and a denim vest that he 
wears over his bare chest, stops Elsie as she 
inspects two large cardboard barrels in 
front of Ratner's Dairy Restaurant, to give 
his version of cummings' "my father 
moved through dooms of love." He lisps 
his poetic riff in a soft girlish voice: 
sweet elsie moved through dunes of trash 
through stains of paint through halves of 
cloth 
deathing each morning into each night 
my elsie moved through dogs of fright 

Elsie looks at the boy warmly and touches 
his arm. He smiles, kisses her on the cheek 
and offers a flower from his hat, but the 
gift frightens her, and she moves away 
quickly. The boy blows her a kiss as Elsie 
heads south to Houston Street, and home. 

The farthest west Elsie ever gets is 
Union Square. She works her way up 2nd 
Avenue, goes across 14th to Klein's then 
back down the other side to Avenue C, 
down to Houston and across to the Bowery 
and home. 

Home for Elsie and her dogs is what's 
left of an old brick yard at the lower end 
of The Bowery, where there used to be a 
great many old-fashioned brick kilns-
large red brick domes with earthen floors 
and open hearths in which an earlier 
generation of craftsmen made the bricks 
and slabs of brown stone that built New 
York. The brick domes, like the artisans 
who worked them, are mostly gone now, 
but one--<>r most of one- remains, 
hidden behind a Bowery bar and flop-
house, and Elsie calls it home. 

The dome, which is about fifteen feet at 
its highest point and about twenty feet 
in diameter, is by New York apartment 
standards rather spacious. Elsie has run 
electricity from the hotel to her home with 
a Rube Goldberg patchwork of extension 
cords, zip cord and black electrician's 
tape running down the hearth's chimney 
and into Elsie's quarters. The cord gives 
life to an old fashioned floor lamp with a 
broken Tiffany shade, that despite its 
damage would probably bring several hun-
dred dollars in an uptown antique shop. 

Elsie also has a hot plate and a splendid 
looking pink electric blanket with silk 
binding and dual controls as well as a 
space heater. The blanket, Elsie's most 
valued possession-she's indifferent to 
the rest-is spread casually across an ob-

cenely filthy mattress which in turn rests 
on slabs of cardboard. The door to Elsie's 
oven is a tiny arched opening in the bricks 
-tiny in order to keep heat in, during 
the dome's more productive days. Now 
the opening is just the right size for the 
dogs, but Elsie has to crawl through on her 
knees. She keeps a pail of water near the 
hot plates; the dome of course, has no 
running water. At night she covers the 
doorway with a wooden crate marked 
"Dried Norwegian Codfish: Heavily 
Salted." By day the crate is a bedside table. 

Inside her dome in addition to her 
furniture, Elsie has her "piles," mounds 
of carefully selected and arranged scraps 
of cloth, bits of plastic, and tin foil and 
string-souvenirs from days when she 
did more than just pick through the rub-
bish. The order of the piles is very private 
and very distinct, and Elsie has obviously 
spent a lot of time keeping things straight. 

There are no apparent signs of Elsie's 
past life among her possessions and the 
only decorations in the dome are two pic-
tures torn from magazines, one of Marlon 
Brando in "The Wild One" and the other 
of Pope John XXIII celebrating mass at 
St. Peter's. 

Elsie is unclear as to how long she bas 
lived in the oven, but she cannot or will 
not recall living anywhere else. The dogs, 
Elsie, Elsie and Brownie, live in the dome 
too. "Brownie, he sleeps with me all the 
time" Elsie says, "the other ones, Elsie 
and the other Elsie, just in the winter time. 
This time of year sometimes they sleep 
here; sometimes they don't." 

Elsie seems to have worked out an ar-
rangement with the flophouse that shields 
her from the prying eyes of The Bow-
ery and allows for the use of the hotel's 
bathroom facilities. The hotel's manager, 
a gentleman not given to casual chats, 
seemed to think that the oven, like Elsie 
and her dogs, had always been there. 

Elsie sometimes picks up spare change pan-
handling outside the Variety Photo Plays 
on 3rd Avenue near 14th Street. With her 
dogs asleep on the pavement, Elsie stands 
beneath the marquee and politely mumbles 
to passersby soliciting "extra money." 

She keeps her rolled-up newspaper handy 
while she's panhandling, and when the 
mood is upon her, Elsie swats her bene-
factors, black or white, rich or poor, 
whether or not they've given her money. 

Once in a while she goes into the Variety 
Photo Plays, in the morning admission is 
forty five cents. On movie days, Elsie ties 
Elsie, Elsie and Brownie to a parking 
meter in front of the theatre and goes in 
to watch the double feature. She usually 
stays only an hour or so; then, concerned 
with her brood, or perhaps bored with 
Hollywood, she leaves and heads back to 
14th Street. 

For all her unusual habits and style, Elsie 
seems reasonably content with her life-
or at least it hasn't occurred to her to 
question it. Perhaps the strangest thing 
about her is that although she doesn't 
say it, one gets the impression that Elsie 
assumes everyone lives the way she does. 
Like all of us, she manages to find simple 
pleasures in her daily routine, and like all 
of us, she has her share of routine dis-
appointments. 

One of her greatest joys is playing with 
the small girls who skip rope on the side-
walks year round. The girls chant the 
same verses that girls have chanted for 
generations, adding only their Spanish 
accents. And Elsie loves to tie Elsie, Elsie
