The Five-Year B.A. may take you to lands away and be-
yond but when it's all over, you have to come back to Yale. 
by Richard Conniff 
Kingman Brewster glanced at the pile of 
uneaten french fries on his plate like a 
wishful but self-restrained weight-watcher. 
He pushed back his chair and inconspicu-
ously began twiddling with a book of 
matches. The student sitting to the Presi-
dent's left gulped down his second cup of 
coffee and said, "Well, it seems as if we 
agree on the necessity of reform. Hope-
fully, we can work together to convince the 
Course of Study Committee to adopt the 
proposals. You can work from the top and 
we'll work from the bottom." 

Brewster chuckled and said, "You mean 
you want to squash them from both sides." 

Five-Year B.A. Program Director William 
Foltz laughed nervously from the corner. 
To discuss changing Yale's academic 
structure with Kingman Brewster while 
lunc,hing at a place like Mory's seems 
almost as awkward as talking to Tricia 
Nixon about Women's Liberation while 
touring the White House. Yet last Thurs-
day, eleven returning participants in the 
Five-Year B.A. Program lunched with 
President Brewster at Mory's to discuss 
such change. Conversation centered 
around a set of proposals previously sub-
mitted to Brewster by the "Fivers" aimed 
at changing the academic structure of the 
university. Sipping an Old Fashioned, 
Brewster listened as the Fivers explained 
that their proposals grew out of a dissatis-
faction with the insulated academic en-
vironment they encountered upon their 
return to Yale. 

Brewster sympathized with the desire of 
the Fivers to introduce greater flexibility 
and broad inter-disciplinary approaches 
into the academic framework. But here-
luctantly admitted, "I haven't really read 
the proposals yet ... the first thing I'll 
have to do is look them over." 

"Right on," a Fiver muttered sar-
castically. 

The chaos of the Sixties will collapse be-
hind us in less than a month. It could have 
been a decade echoing the calm and com-
placent 1-lik.e-lke years which preceded it; 
instead, it exploded. This decade has been 
a time for change, a time for hatcheting 
outdated standards and innovating with 
untested substitutes. By the mid-Sixties, 
even Kingman Brewster had raised the 
axe over a traditional American concept 
of education. It was in the Spring of 1965 
that he asked Yale College to join the in-
novation by examining the worth of its own 
foundation: the unalterable four-year col-
lege career. As an alternative to it, Brew-
ster created the Yale Experimental Five-
Year B.A. Program. 

Brewster felt" ... that the unbroken 
prospect of competitively driven, conven-
tional, academic achiev~ment from age 
five to twenty-five breaks the motivation 
of many of the most highly motivated and 
dulls the intellectual enthusiasm of the 
most intelligent." He conceived of the 
Five-Year B.A. as a remedy to this prob-
lem, as an exploration of new paths of 
learning. It was to be an attempt to expand 
the student's capacity for self-education. 

But the Five-Year B.A. Program served 
only to emphasize the problem. 

There exists at Yale a basic incompatibil-
ity betwen the academic and non-academic 
worlds. With few exceptions, Yale courses 
center on the observation of experience 
rather than on experience itself. Our art 
comes to us through slide projectors, our 
anthropology through texts. The Five-Year 
student has the opportunity to escape this 
academic world, at least for a year, and to 
further his learning through living abroad. 
Unfortunately, he finds that living experi-
ence is incompatible with the emphasis on 
purely academic pursuit prevalent at Yale. 

The lack of individual responsibility in 
forming his education intensifies the Five-
Year student's sense of frustration. He 
finds himself shunted into a standard ma-
jor with no relation to his work abroad. 
The Division IV program supposedly al-
lows him to create his own major, but the 
five-year students imply that it operates 
under" ... antiquated assumptions of what 
constitutes an 'intellectually justified' pro-
gram of studies." 

To correct these problems, the eleven 
students who met with Brewster last 
Thursday made five proposals which 
would affect not only Five-Year B.A. stu-
dents but, more importantly, all Yale 
students. 

1. The replacement of present major require-
ments with suggested guidelines formed 
by a faculty-student committee within 
each major, so that a student may affiliate 
with a major without strictly limiting him-
self to its guidelines. 

2. That all students at the end of sophomore 
year present an intended program of study 
for the next two years, not limited to 
present major programs. 

3. Redefinition of the credit system to allow 
greater emphasis on courses of individual 
interest. For example, a student could 
arrange to receive two credits for a one 
credit course in which he intends to con-
centrate more heavily than other students 
in the course. 

4. Use of the two grade pass-fail system. 

5. The continuation and expansion of the 
Five-Year B.A. Program (already guaran-
teed in weaker form by faculty action 
allowing two-semester leave for indepen-
dent projects to any student in good 
standing). 

Today, nearly five years since its incep-
tion, the Five-Year B.A. faces natural 
death; a weaker five-year alternative has 
gained ground; but for most, the tradi-
tional four-year career stands victorious. 
In 1970, the Carnegie Foundation Grant 
which finances the program's annual bud-
get of nearly $50,000 expires. In light of 
that, both the university and the students 
have begun questioning the value of the 
program to their education and to the 
quality of education at Yale. Brewster, 
Foltz and others will meet this month to 
examine the Five-Year B.A. The answers 
to their questions will determine whether 
the present sophomore class will be the last 
to benefit from the advantages of the ex-
perimental Five-Year B.A. Program. 

Since 1965, forty-six students have en-
joyed those advantages. The program has 
selected them from a small group of ap-
plicants which remains small because of 
paperwork designed to discourage all but 
the more seriously interested applicants. 
The chosen few soon find themselves scat-
tered in unusual situations across the 
world. Each student makes his own ar-
rangements for a suitable job in a non-
Western culture at which be can work for 
twelve to fifteen months. 

Those selected receive assistance in 
dealing with the draft, as well as medical 
attention and advice in choosing prep-
aratory courses, which include tutorial 
arrangements. Yale also pays the travel 
expenses. The only obligation after the 
student arrives in the country is that he 
communicate regularly with the program 
office. 

Participants in the Five-Year B.A. have 
found themselves doing everything from 
teaching debating and English in Katsina, 
Nigeria to translating at the Japan Eco-
nomic Research Center in Tokyo. Almost 
all agree that aspect of the experience has 
been worthwhile and often amazing. 

One student wrote: "Friday evening, 
perhaps stimulated by my interest in his 
performance, one of the Durgas, still 
masked, took from around his own neck 
three special garlands of seeds and flowers 
and placed them around mine. At that 
moment, although I did not know it until 
my astonished village friends told me, I 
became officially, and beyond a shadow 
of a doubt, a Hindu God." 

But the experience also leads to a ques-
tioning of deeper issues. Many five-year 
students, like the people they live with, 
look with jaundiced eye at the abun-
dance of Ugly Americans they encounter 
around the world. They see, as few Ameri-
cans have the opportunity to see, the in-
sanity of South American dictatorships, 
of corrupt Congolese governments and of 
American policies in the midst of this. 

In that sense, they do achieve the
