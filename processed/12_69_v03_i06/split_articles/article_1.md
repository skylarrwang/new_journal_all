Comment: the numbers game, the fifties game, and, 
if that isn't enough, the ol' time strippers' game. 
Numbers 
What kind of a day was it? A day like all days, filled with 
those events which alter and illuminate our lives-only 
we were there. 

You bet your sweet one we were. From the first blurred 
New York Times column the Monday after Thanksgiving, 
which was a real joke this year. 

It was a day of increasing reality, disbelief and im-
mediacy, with the morning speeding by and huddled 
groups at lunch tables chain smoking and almost joking 
about the imminent blast of outrage soon to be perpetrated 
on American youth. 

A day of increasing sweatshiver with the reason not 
until eight that night. Prime beef would stand naked and 
helpless before the Court of Fate and Stupidity-and book 
larnin' don't do no good 'tall in karma country. 

The afternoon a replay of puberty's first possible ball. 
One can't really plan that which comes from above. One 
must hope for the best and stride whistling into the 
dark. Right. Activities are incidental, the future is what 
counts, and that's at eight. 

Conversations concern matinees of youth and door 
prizes won by the friend you let into line behind you; 
the future, if; if not; the absurdity of television as a 
medium; and birthdates. Nothing is said. 

Once again, a feeling of world rumble and celestial 
cacaphony. Once again, brought to you by everyone pos-
sible. Of course the Kennedy assassinations were men-
tioned, and the Cuban Missile Crisis and Shirley Jackson. 
But they didn't really seem too important Monday night. 

A night when Point Blank's dominant theme is paranoia.


Into a black and blue television room. Laugh-In without 
the audio, WYBC supplying that, visions of conspiracies 
as Laugh-In skits seem synched with NUMBER VOICE, 
who is interrupted only by tragic audible despair. 

Sam who studies stops in hopefully, "Have they called 
September 14th yet?"' 

Hard knocks and wet socks. Pain. Winners and losers. 
Groups just sitting, smoking, looking beyond, eyes cJosed, 
heads bobbing, sigh, sigh, shit and sigh. 

Eventually, the wasted participants appear drifting 
throughout the darkness, exchanging numbers, asking 
about friends, throwing and kicking things, just walking. 

Shadows merge, sweet strength in numbers. Students 
forced to deal with ultimates, many dragged for good into 
outlaw consciousness. 

The women of America stood weeping as they 
watched. No one was cool or ugly Monday night, just 
dancin' beneath a diamond sky or in Ratzo Rizzo death 
slumps. The ship is slippin' from the dock, Johnny's off 
to war. The best night of the year to get laid, a further 
forging of a generation; or a diving of the grateful and the 
dead. One thing's for certain, you'll surely be a-hurtin'.
