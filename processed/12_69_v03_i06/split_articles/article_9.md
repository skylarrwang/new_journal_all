Cha Cha Candy 
It's too bad Richard Farina isn't at Yale 
this year. After two hundred-odd years of 
soul-deadening mono-education, the girls 
have finally arrived, and the boys have 
been down so long that they know less 
about up and down than old Giant Leap 
for Mankind Armstrong in his weightless 
space capsule. They are floating around 
every which way trying to figure out how 
to cope with this major existential event. 
For many of them the road to Recon-
structed T hought is proving to be long and 
rough. 

Take the college social committees, for 
example. Two of them (at least) hired 
strippers, yep, that's right, bump-and-
grind artists, for their Harvard weekend 
festivities. In at least one case the com-
mittee found the whole affair a bit trau-
matic. Some of the committee members 
were against the idea, some were in favor 
of it, some didn't much care either way-
and all of them were embarrassed. 

The female members of the social com-
mittee were asked to leave the room when 
the subject came up. The idea was not to 
~tic~ your neck out in front of the girls 
JUSt m case the other guys were against it. 
It's OK to talk about it with the other guys, 
but, gosh, the girls might get offended 
and there's no sense risking that unless it's 
unavoidable-like if the vote is close and 
you have to have their opinion. Well, in 
t~e e,nd the guys by and large agreed, the 
g1rls vo~es were not needed and the thing 
was dec1ded upon. But of course it wasn't 
announced to the college at large for fear 
of upsetting a lot of people, and it would 
~II be so messy and embarrassing. 

I must confess that for no particular 
reason I missed the first show. Right after 
I got to the dance, however, Bill came up 
to me and asked me if I'd seen it. He said 
he hadn't seen it either but that he had 
heard from reliable sources that such an 
event had taken place. It sounded like a 
wild rumor so we sat down and with 
Alice's Restaurant-like diligende, tried to 
figure out what might actually have hap-
pened. The two most likely things were: 
one, that it was a lie, that nothing had 
happened at all; and, two, that it was a 
joke, that some crazy guy or coed was 
making fun of the old Yale mentality. 

It was neither, for at five minutes to mid-
night Cha Cha Candy came downstairs 
from the college library. And we all sud-
denly knew that it wasn't a lie or a joke: it 
was for real. It proceeded to get more and 
more real for the next five minutes; lights 
low, fraternity types surrounding the 
stage, soul band playing Cannonball Ader-
ley's "Mercy, Mercy" in a slow, soft, 
tempting, mournful, aching way. 

First a cape came down to eager social 
committee arms below the stage. Next 
someone had to do the zipper. After that 
I couldn't see much because Candy seemed 
'?be sitting down or something, but next 
time she popped up she had a telephone 
attached to one of her breasts, and she 
started going around inviting (or daring?) 
people to dial a number. And the tele-
phone dial? Yep, right where you guessed. 

The crowd did not exactly go wild, most-
ly because they did not know just how to 
deal with the situation. Many cheered with 
drunken good nature, a few were appalled, 
and most stood silently by, struck either 
by the crudity of the performance (which, 
at a mere eighty dollars of social fee 
money, was pretty cheap) or the incom-
prehensibility of the stripper's presence in 
the first place. Many unabashedly gawked. 

And, a little surprisingly, the girls, both 
coeds and dates, didn't seem to mind at 
all. 

Afterward the social committee ob-
viously felt kind of guilty about the whole 
thing, so it put out a cover-up story which 
blandly asserted that most people enjoyed 
the show and taunted the silent majority 
by saying only "a few anonymous com-
plaints were heard about the 'degradation 
of the female body.'" 

But would they have said such things at 
all before this year? One suspects that 
thoughts of equality and ideas of rethink-
ing social relations between the sexes are 
gradually and painfully beginning to seep 
into the minds of even the most unrecon-
structed Yalies. That's a good thing cer-
tainly, but I wonder how many more of 
these "conversation pieces" (in the social 
committee's own words) we will have to 
endure. 

We've been down so long it all looks 
fuzzy to us-and it probably will for some 
time yet.
