Searching for consciousness at Esalen: "After spending thousands 
educating our heads, this was the least we could do for our bodies." 
by Alton Wasson and Roz Driscoll 
In its official language, Esalen Institute "is 
a center to explore those trends in the 
behavioral sciences, religion and philoso-
phy which emphasize the potentialities and 
values of human existence. Its activities 
consist of seminars and workshops, re-
search and consulting programs, and a 
resident program exploring new directions 
in education and the behavioral sciences." 
Looking through the catalogue one finds 
such courses as "Authenticity Revisited: a 
workshop for the overgrouped," "Mores, 
Mysticism and Madness," "Ma.ssage and 
Meditation," "The Open Couple," and 
"Dreams, ESP and Altered States of Con-
sciousness." The Esalen experience is, 
however, more than just what the cata-
logue describes: it begins months before 
one actually arrives at the Institute, is 
altered by what one finds there, and con-
tinues long afterwards, growing, shifting or 
changing along with the individual. The 
following is the first-person account by 
Alton Wasson and Roz Driscoll, two mem-
bers of the Yale community who recently 
spent a week at the Institute in Big Sur, 
California. 

Before arriving, our visions of Esalen 
Institute were fabricated of hard-to- be-
lieve stories and vaguely Utopian de-
scriptions. We knew from our reading that 
there were peopfe there involved in verbal 
and nonverbal encounter, the "letting go" 
movement, educational innovation and 
Maslow's theory of human potential. We 
were nervous about the rumors of nudity, 
physical contact and mind-shattering 
encounter, frightened of being touched, 
physically and emotionally, by strangers. 
We both were wiJiing to take the risk, 
however, on the assumption that what one 
is most frightened of may be just what one 
needs. And, of course, we were curious. 
We signed up for a week-long workshop in 
body awareness which cost us $260 each. 
After spending many thousands educating 
our beads, this was the least we could do 
for our bodies. 

To reach Esalen from San Francisco, we 
drove down the coastal highway which 
hung on the edge of the land between the 
mountains and the sea. Each bend in the 
road revealed another awe-inspiring vista. 
This grandeur shook us out of our ordinary 
sensations and intensified the feelings of 
trepidation and anticipation. After several 
hours, we arrived at "Esalen Institute, By 
Reservation Only." We drove down into a 
casual scattering of low buildings and 
assorted trailers. A lovely woman playing 
with a baby sat behind the desk where we 
registered. Our rooms were plain but for a 
tiny vase of fresh flowers, a candle and 
some incense. A few people strolled about 
or sat quietly on the thick lawn in front of 
the lodge. We soon sensed that the am-
bience was far more informal and gentle 
than we had anticipated. No one rushed up 
to greet us or to take us in. We were left 
on our own most of the time. Our first 
meeting that evening (and most subsequent

Yale serving as Chairman of the Yale

meetings) was held in "Maslow," a red-
wood-panelled room containing no fur-
niture except for a thick, red, wall-to-wall 
carpet. You removed your shoes before 
entering. There were about twenty people 
in our group, of all ages and from all over 
the country: a few·psychologists, a few 
students, a secretary, a technician, some 
older women, an ex-minister and several 
people we never really knew at all. The 
leader, Ed Maupin, who wore a long, black 
beard sprinkled with gray was very re-
laxed; and appeared very gentle. He began 
by asking us what we had come to learn, 
and then explained that we would be inves-
tigating the presence of our bodies: the 
feeling the body has in relation to the 
sensual world, and the relation of part to 
part, in an effort to integrate the whole 
body into one's self-awareness. He would 
lead us in daily exercises in the morning, 
give us each two individual sessions of the 
Rolf process, and in the afternoon, others, 
including his wife, would teach us move-
ment and Tai Chi Chuan. The usual Esalen 
extras were bot mineral baths and massage. 

One of the rumors about Esalen revolved 
around the hot mineral baths, the "nude 
baths." We found them to be innocent and 
pleasant, (especially in relation to our fears 
and fantasies) and even liberating in a 
subtle, unobstrusive way. After the first 
moment of embarrassment, it felt natural 
and normal. Men and women could soak 
in the big square tubs always fiJled with hot 
mineral waters, or peacefully sun on the 
deck, looking out over the Pacific, the surf 
crashing and the sea otters playing below. 
At night the only light was from candles 
and the moon.

Having participated in several T-groups, 
I felt that as a chaplain, I needed some 
training in non-verbal encounter groups, 
which I thought were central to the Esaleo 
experience. The workshop leaders and 
staff, however, did not resort to facile 
openness in getting to know us, and the 
slow pace of working in the seminar and of 
just moving and breathing was not what I 
had expected. Where were the encounters? 
I soon found them among the others in our 
seminar who had come with similar ex-
pectations. It became clear that Ed was not 
interested in leading an encounter group, 
so we met once without him. The attempt 
was abortive, and I finally accepted the fact 
that I was there to Jearn about relating to 
myself, and even more, I was to learn to 
relate to myself as a body.

On the other hand, I was delighted to 
discover that there would be no encounter 
activity, but I joined the spontaneous group 
attempt out of some sense of duty to the
