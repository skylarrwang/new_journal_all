Days of Grease 
Sha-Na-Na was a fabulous success at Yale, two thousand 
cheering people, some of them greased up, rave reviews, 
and lots of money for the Record. It was the Harvard 
weekend's Rock 'n' Roll Revival, the Grease Festival, 
cathartic therapy for college kids on their way out of the 
'60's. In a certain sense, it was just the big bash on Satur-
day night; then again it was an economy trip back to the 
Fifties which many people there neither remembered 
nor admired very much. It was a surprizing trip. Grease 
was nice, hanging on the juke box was cool, bot rods were 
very definitely the big thing. You didn't have to worry 
about being white because blacks were still niggers then. 
You could shout "We like Ike" or even "Ike is a Kike" 
and "Get the Gooks." Because it happened at Yale, you 
didn't have to worry that the real old hoods who made the 
music would come back and ·make trouble. 

It was a comic routine, but it should have been much 
more. Rock 'n' Roll is more than that, and to turn it into 
a joke ip a denial of the real energy of the Fifties and of 
the relf.ion of that energy to the music of all of the Sixties. 
''Teen lAngel" is a tremendous cliche. But it deals with 
love and death and the horror of a fatal car accident. If 
one wants to accept the real energy of that song, it is 
tragic, and meaningfully so. Hot rods were not a joke 
either, and the meaning of dancing around the juke box 
isn't really different than dancing now or anytime in his-
tory. Chuck Berry's song "School Days," about listening 
to rock after school, brought on hippies and the "rock 
culture" that we are a part of now. 

The music itself is worthy of sincere attention. No 
matter how simple or badly executed, it was effective. It 
made kids dance all over the country, it turned them on. 
The "magic of the rock 'n roll, the magic that can set you 
free," worked then and it works now-same rock 'n roll, 
same magic. 

Compare Sha-N a-Na with the Beatles and Rolling 
Stones in 1963. They all rediscovered the power and 
vibrancy of old Rock 'n' Roll. The Beatles and the Stones 
felt rhythm and blues was still valid, and they poured their 
own energy into it. They did old music, and it was NEW. 
It was Chuck Berry's, and it was their own. Their careers 
rest on their tasting ability to feel the energies of their 
own times, and effectively express them, relating them 
to old sounds and future forces. They keep reinvesting 
their musical wealth and they borrow from every source, 
but the music is fresh and honest. 

Sha-Na-Na just have not done that. They are on a 
memory trip. They are doing someone else's show adding 
nothing of their own. By not committing themselves, 
maybe they meant to force the audience to commit itself. 
But at Yale, it did not. Sha-Na-Na's tack of sensitivity to 
the music promoted a separation from its real forces. I 
heard several people say that it was the best rock concert 
they bad ever been to. How can that be true when they 
clearly were not touched by what happened, when they 
had not really been into that experience? Before Sha-N a-
Na can honestly sing "Rock 'n' Roll is here to stay ... 
rock wilt go down in history·• they will have to com-
municate the real magic. When the revival is not a memory 
trip, it will not be exclusive either. The people will know 
that "Too Much Monkey Business," "Heat Wave," and 
"Help" have to be revived. When they dance the Lindy, 
there wilt still be the monkey, the shimmy, and even the 
Freddy.
