It isn't tliateasy to leave Vietnam 
by William Stott 
When President Brewster spoke the sen-
tence at the Moratorium Rally, I thought 
I hadn't heard right. The next day, though, 
the newspapers published it in all its 
oddity: 
Let us admit that it is not easy to abandon 
the anonymous masses of South Vietnamese 
who have relied upon us. 

I don't know what Mr. Brewster meant 
this sentence to mean in the context of his 
appeal for a disengagement from the war. 
I assume he didn't want it to say what it 
said: that we should abandon those who 
rely on us while comforting ourselves with 
the assurance that it's not easy for us to 
behave so despicably. But if he did mean 
this, I think I agree with him. 

Without question, if we pull out of 
South Vietnam now, a lot of people who 
count on us are going to suffer. Who they 
are, how many they are and what will 
happen to them are matters no one I know 
has much discussed. Before we kill them 
off, maybe we should. 

First, we must dispell the agreeable 
leftist illusion that the only people who 
will suffer when the Americans withdraw 
are those who deserve to: the great land 
owners and the military leaders. No doubt 
these people, as a class, should suffer; but 
it is precisely they who won't. When South 
Vietnam falls, the rich land owners and 
the top echelon military will be far away. 

Already their capital, their heirlooms, 
their sons and daughters, often their wives 
and retainers, too, have preceded them 
into exile. You find them in Bangkok and 
in the South of France. Their sons are 
learning skills-medicine, architecture, 
commerc<!-that they won't have to own a 
country to exercise. 

The people who will suffer when we 
pull out are hard to name. They are not 
the five percent who are upper class: the 
rich, as I say, emigrate. They are not the 
seventy percent who are landless peas-
ants: the poor st~y and suffer, and will con-
tinue to suffer, with or without us, until the 
Vietnamese economy is modernized. The 
people who will suffer as a consequence 
of our withdrawal are those who remain. 

Who are they,this remaining anony-
mous quarter of the country? A social sci-
entist might describe them as the middle 
class. A large percentage are, ironically, 
North Vietnamese-people who took 
refuge in the South because they didn't 
want to live under Ho Chi Minh's regime 
or feared that if they tried to they would 
be killed as were hundreds of thousands 
who stayed behind. 

In thinking of the war, we continually 
overlook this "middle" class of between 
three and four million people; to us, as 
President Brewster says, they are "anony-
mous." We should have noticed them long 
ago, because their welfare was the only 
moral justification on which to build a 
policy toward the South Vietnamese. They 
are the people willing to see the society 
change and able to make it do so: the 
trained workers, the small professional and 
business men, the teachers and the minor 
government officials. The final failure of 
our Vietnam policy-which, contrary to 
its intention, has proved: that outside help, 
however generous, cannot stop "wars of 
national liberation"; that the Domino 
Theory will hold true if the other side is 
able to mount such wars; that the United 
States will never again live up to its com-
mitment to intervene on behalf of an 
attacked ally unless that ally fully controls 
its own people-the final failure of our 
policy will be to be destroy those Viet-
namese whose welfare should have been 
our major concern. 

"Destroy"-is this too strong a word? I 
hope so. But no one can say. Joseph Alsop 
predicts that our withdrawal will bring on 
the murder of 1,500,000 people. Mary 
McCarthy, at the other end of the political 
spectrum, says that only 10,000 risk being 
killed and suggests that the U.S. relocate 
them. Of the two, I'm afraid that Alsop 
may be closer to the truth. I say this be-
cause I had the misfortune to meet the 
villain of another war-a war the radicals, 
at home and abroad, have always equated 
with our war in Vietnam. 

When I met Fran~ois in the summer of 
1966, he was a tall, corpulent young man 
of twenty-five with thickly pomaded fair 
hair combed straight back in the Spanish 
fashion; his cheeks were immense and 
beardless as a baby's and his eyes no 
bigger than raisins. He came to see me in 
the American Cultural Center I ran in 
Fez, Morocco, because he considered 
immigrating to the United States. 

He was a Frenchman, but a French-
mao born and raised in Algeria. After the 
revolution he found, as did many Alger-
ian-born French, that he couldn't stom-
ach the discrimination in France. As for 
Algeria, living there was out of the ques-
tion, he said. And without any prompting, 
he told me why. 

Fran~ois had been in the O.A.S., the 
brutal cabal in the French army which 
opposed De Gaulle's belated attempt to 
give independence to the Algerians. On 
and off for five years, three of them after 
the Algerian war. Fran~ois had served as 
courier for Jacques Soustelle, an O.A.S. 
chief. He had given interviews in Sous-
telle's name; he remembered that in 
Copenhagen during the early sixties he 
gave one to Joseph Alsop. 

His main work during the war, how-
ever, bad been for the French army. Be-
cause he spoke Arabic andknew the 
country, he was a military liaison between 
the Algerian population in a certain 
province and the French government. It 
was his job to persuade influential Al-
gerians that the French were there to stay 
and would protect them. 

Fran~ois then went on to make a point 
that surprised me. He insisted that it was 
not the French that were most cruel to the 
innocent anonymous mass of the Al-
gerians, but the rebels themselves. "Every-
one knows that the N.L.F. used terrorism," 
he said. "But no one seems to remember 
that they used it mainly against their 
people." I said that probably the N.L.F. 
felt it had to punish those who collabo-
rated with the French. "I'm not speaking 
of the collaborators," he said. "Of course 
they killed traitors; that's war. I mean 
plain people. They weren't strong enough 
to take on the French, so they pushed 
around Arabs." As he explained it, the 
N.L.F.'s chief goal was to discredit French 
ability to protect Algerians, particularly in 
rural areas. "As soon as the Algerians knew 
that we couldn't defend them, they would 
go over to the rebels." To show France's 
weakness, terrorists would strike at ran-
dom against Algerians who didn't support 
their cause. Villages refusing to pay 
tribute were located and blown up, their 
leaders killed. 

As Fran~ois' district was a calm one, 
he could argue persuasively that the Al-
gerian people were safe with France. 
Indeed, so persuasive was he, he claimed, 
that a majority of the people and nearly 
• all the leaders remained loyal to France. 
He swore-as have all Algerian-born 
Frenchmen I've known-that even at the 
end a majority of the Algerian people 
wanted to stay with France. They weren't 
able to, he said, because De Gaulle chealed 
them. In the 1962 plebiscite in which the 
Algerians voted an overwhelming oui 
to France's offer of autonomy, the non 
ballots were purple-a color no devout 
Muslim will touch. But the vote really 
didn't matter, said Fran~ois: before there-
sults were counted, Paris announced that 
Algeria had chosen independence. I didn't 
know what to make of this story: it seemed 
all cockeyed. 

He then said something though that 
struck me as plausible. "What did most 
of the Algerians want? Simple. A little 
peace, that's all." He put his head back 
and touched his fat chin with two fingers, 
looking at me out of the corner of his eye. 
He said, experimentally, as though curious 
of my reaction, "I am responsible for the 
death of I 0,000 people." I only stared at 
him and said nothing. I knew immediately 
that he had told me his past just to tell me 
that, but even knowing this didn't help·me 
find words. It was an unusual accomplish-
ment for a man of twenty-five to feel he 
had so much blood on his head; Fran~ois 
didn't like it. He shifted his weight in the 
chair. He had told the Algerians of his 
district that France would defend them. 
When France pulled out, an uncountable 
number had been killed. He called it 
I 0,000. Surely it was much less. 

"Collaborators?" I asked hopefully. 
"Collaborators? Like fun. If we'd had 
10.000 collaborators. the war wouldn't 
have taken place." He said that the first 
to be killed were the leaders whom he'd 
persuaded of France's constancy. They 
were by no means the last. Algerians who 
were clerks or skilled workers in French 
establishments, or mechanized laborers 
on French farms; Algerians who spoke 
French too well or had too much educa-
tion for their village; and finally Algerians 
who had money or a nice house or a motor 
scooter or a bicycle were killed. "You've 
got to understand," said Fran~ois, "the 
rebels had nothing-but nothing. Only, 
they had weapons." 

And this wa.~ the last revelation he 
brought me. Today Fran~ois lives, I pre-
sume, in Canada. He had no relatives in 
the United States who woull;l sponsor him 
and none of the skills our immigration 
Jaws favor. Canada, as I told him, has 
more liberal standards, and particularly 
seeks French speat<ers. Fran~ois would 
have preferred to be an American, he said. 
He liked our combat in Vietnam. 

In subsequent conversation with people 
who had known the Algerian revolution, 
I tried to find out whether what Fran~is 
said was anything like the truth. Those I 
spoke with and the books I read agreed on 
one point: the N.L.F. had killed many 
more Algerians than French. The excuse 
usually offered- two very liberal United 
Nations officials from the third world 
countrie, gave it to me, each shaking his 
head- was that those murdered belonged 
to "opposition groups" that is, groups 
wanting independence of both France and 
the N .L.F. This is a half-truth at best. An 
American woman who worked from 1959 
to 1963 in a Quaker-sponsored camp for 
Algerian refugees in Morocco, said that 
while most of the peasants had been dis-
placed during the French army's relocating 
of their villages, a large number had fled 
the N.L.F.'s violence. 

On other matters it was more difficult to 
find a consensus. There are widely con-
flicting eo;timates of how many Algerians 
were killed in the revolution. The only 
reporter who discusses the killing of 
Algerians by Algerians, Arslan Hum-
baraci, a strong supporter of the indepen-
dence movement, puts the figure at nearly 
1 ,000,000. The observers with whom I 
discussed this issue agreed that.a very 
large number of Algerians were killed in 
the year after independence and only a 
small percentage of them by O.A.S. terror-
ism. 

1 suggested to a French diplomat of 
liberal views that most of the bloodshed 
after the French withdrawal resulted from 
virtual civil war between rebel groups 
and, within the N.L.F., between partisans 
of Ben Youssef Ben Khedda and Ahmed 
Ben Bella. He disagreed. 'They fought for 
control of the country, yes. But then they 
fought for everything." According to him, 
when the French gave up the war, there 
ceased to be a force in Algeria to police 
the rebels. "The rebels themselves couldn't 
do it; they were too fragmented. So what 
did you have? You had bands of guer-
rillas, a few men in each, who knew 
nothing but destruction and who felt ttiey 
had made-as was true-a great sacrifice 
for their country. But they come into a 
village or town, and what do they see? 


--- Page 11 ---

Men, Arabs, who haven't carried weapons, 
haven't risked their lives for freedom, and 
who yet own something more than just a 
rifle." He argued that many rebels simply 
took whatever they wanted, even if they 
had to kill to get it, because they felt it 
was owed to them. "You must remember 
these men hadn't gotten high wages for 
their war." 

Asked how many Algerian civilians died 
after the French pulled out, the diplomat 
said. in a tone of disgust at my innocence, 
"Ah, rat Des choses com me ra n.e se 
comptent pas." ("Things like that can't 
be counted.") 

When we withdraw from Vietnam and the 
Saigon regime falls, the guerrillas of the 
VietCong will come from the countryside 
to claim the wages of their victory. And 
who will stop them? Not the South Viet-
namese army; with it~ leaders flown, its 
provisions and salary stopped. it may turn 
out to be as de~tructive of the nation as 
its adversary. North Vietnam's army in 
the South will also, one assumes, join the 
plundering. The people that will pay these 
armies are. the Algerian war suggests, 
those who are still there and have any-
thing to lose. Those who will die are those 
whom the VietCong have been killing all 
along: teachers, tradesmen, salaried work-
ers, doctors and lawyers, minor govern-
ment officials. 

If we were to remain in South Vietnam, 
could we protect this middle class? Only if 
we stayed indefinitely. I think. The longer 
the war, the more bitter will be the reckon-
ing when we pull out and leave tbe field to 
the guerrillas. For it must be clear now to 
all rational observers that either we fight 
for years to come or we leave the field to 
them. President Nixon knows this. The 
"Vietnamization'' he promises is a decep-
tion, though just whom he wants it to 
deceive is not year clear. Richard Rovere 
feels "Vietnamization" will prove the code 
word for unilateral withdrawal, a selling-
out of those who rely on us. My fear is 
that the President means the word to trick 
not Vietnamese but Americans. His No-
vember 3rd speech makes "Vietnamiza-
tion" the excuse for Jetting the war go on 
as is, with our soldiers dying for no good 
reason. In essence Nixon said: "We want 
nothing more than to turn the war over to 
the South Vietnamese, and when the 
enemy stops fighting enough, we'll do it." 
{}ut the enemy won't stop. And if 60,000 
American soldiers is the most the Sooth 
Vietnamese can replace at this late date, we 
can't expect them to take over the burden 
of the war for years to come. And our 
people won't wait years. 

Sooner or later, pressure at home will 
force a President of the United States to 
pull our troo~ out of Vietnam. Sooner or 
later, the VietCong will win. They know 
it. and because they do, it is probably too 
late to appease them. A coalition govern-
ment including the N.L.F., even if such a 
compromise is attainable, would by no 
means bring the Viet Gong UndCT co:ntr·oJ: 

In Algeria, theN .L.F. guided rebel troops 
in battle, yet couldn't police them when 
victory came. In Vietnam the N.L.F. are 
politicians, not soldiers; they don't lead 
the rebels in war and won't in peace. 

Besides, as far as we know, the N.L.F. 
leaders, though middle class, prefer an-
archy to the old order. The Viet Cong are 
out to undo the society; it has a debt to 
them, they feel, and they have the means 
to make it pay. The N.L.F. couldn't stop 
them and probably wouldn't want to. 

How many people will be killed when 
we finally leave Vietnam? I have no idea: 
des choses comme fa n.e se comptent pas. 
Many Vietnamese who relied on us will 
be destroyed, but if this is the price of get-
ting us out of the war, I'm ready for them 
to pay it. And I'm ashamed to say, I'm 
confident our souls won't be much troubled 
at their suffering. In the last five years, 
there have been several episodes of unac-
countable civilian murder. First the Al-
gerian war. Then the Vietnamese war. 
Then 500,000 Indonesians killed in the 
name of anti-communism. Then I ,500,000 
Biafrans. Only about the last of these 
have we Americans shown a slight concern, 
and of course the Biafrans are black, and 
blacks just now are at the center of our 
thinking. We will overlook the destruction 
of South Vietnam's anonymous masses, I 
feel sure, as we've overlooked such things 
before. Perhaps, as Mr. Brewster says, it 
will not be easy: this time the blood will be 
on our heads. But we Americans can do it, 
if only we put our minds to it. ~
