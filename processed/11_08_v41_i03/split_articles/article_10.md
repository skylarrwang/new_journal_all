TEACH FOR 
AMERICA 
On the second floor of the Whitney 
and Betty MacMillan Center for Interna-
tional and Area Studies one November af-
ternoon, a group of four visiting scholars is 
squeezed around an oval table for lunch. A 
woman with dark, billowing hair takes out 
a Ziploc container of rice mixed with tra-
ditional Indian dhal and yogurt. The man 
beside her mangles through Chinesenoo-
dles with chopsticks; his neighbors munch 
on falafel wraps. Interspersing bites of food 
with chatter in diverse accents, they share 
stories of their home countries, bringing 
global interaction to Hillhouse Avenue. 

In 1996, when Professor Gustav Ranis 
took over as director of the then-named 
Yale Council on International and Area 
Studies, the council brought only three to 
four visiting scholars to campus annually. 
The year before, the Council had con-
solidated and moved into Luce Hall, and 
President Levin 
who had already made a 
priority of internationalization of the Uni-
versity's research and curriculum 
charged 
Ranis with the mission of, metaphorically 
and literally, "filling up the building." The 
MacMillan Center now invites approxi-
mately one hundred such visiting scholars 
to Yale in both teaching and researching 
capacities, with about half typically com-
ing from abroad. 

The numbers of international visitors 
across the University are far more stagger-
ing, and Yale consistently ranks among the 
top ten U.S. institutions sponsoring schol-
ars from abroad. During the 1997-1998 
school year, Yale hosted 889 international 
visitors. By 2007-2008, this number had 
more than doubled, with 1,920 scholars 
visiting from just under a hundred coun-. 
tries. More than half of these scholars are 
affiliated with the School of Medicine or 
various scientific research facilities, how-
ever, and rarely encounter undergraduates 
in a classroom . 

What differentiates the MacMillan 
Center's international visitors is their abil-
ity to provide their students with a direct 
link to the global issues that they-research 
and teach. Jarie Edwards, dean ofinterna-
tional affairs for Yale College, emphasizes 
the immediacy that international scholars 
bring when they teach about their home 
regions. "There's nothing like studying 
'ith someone who has just gotten off a 
plane from, say, Bolivia, to learn about the 
situation there right now," she says. 

International professors are especially 
prevalent in two relatively new majors:-
South Asian Studies and Modern Middle 
East Studies. Until more permanent fac-
ulty members are hired, these visitors can 
fill positions and draw · attention to the 
new maJors. 

Larisa Satara, who joined the Mac-
Millan Center staff six years ago as the first 
director of the Visiting Scholars Exchange, 
organized academic orientations to life at 
Yale. Satara explains _ that visitors come to 
Yale for a variety of durations and in dif-
ferent capacities: Some teach classes, some 
come to do their own research, some stay 
the whole year, others for only six weeks. 
These scholars are distributed throughout 
Yale's departments and the various coun-
cils at the MacMillan Center and receive 
grants and fellowships from Yale as well as 
from their home countries. 

The Office of International Students 
and Scholars works to prepare visitors for 
life at Yale, in New Haven, in America. It 
supplements faculty-led dinner conver-
sations on "Understanding America''-
discussions about American political and 
social issues 
with a more informal forum 
called "Crossing Cultures," which focuses 
on more mundane aspects of American 
life: email etiquette, "how to make small 
talk," and U.S. holiday traditions. A popu-
lar topic is "U.S. food," the discussion of 
which includes instructions on how to eat 
a baked potato. 

But cultural instruction cannot always 
ease the strain on international families. 
Marvan Khawaja, a visiting professor 
from the American University of Bei-
rut, has found the transition to be "very 
challenging." His wife, who worked as 
a painter in Lebanon, is trying to pur-
sue her art in New Haven but has begun 
working at a day care to keep · busy . . The 
situation has also been difficult for Kha-
waja's 13-year-old son, for whom it took 
the family three months to find a school. 
"[My son] was very nervous about coming 
to a new school, about how he would get 
along with the other students, about our 
name ... " Khawaja trails off. It probably 
would have been easier if his son had not 
come, he later confides. 

Yet for Charu Gupta, the most difficult 
aspect of the transition has been leaving her 
13-year-old son behind in India, where she 
teaches at the University of Delhi. Gupta's 
son will have to take centralized board ex-
ams next year and they both thought he 
would fall behind in his work if he joined 
his mother in America for the year. 

The challenges faced by Khawaja and 
Gupta are shared by many scholars with 
families, whether or not their spouses and 
children move to New Haven. The transi-
tion forces children to adjust to new envi-
ronments or learn to be independent from 
their parents; spouses have to make sacri-
fices and often take on unfamiliar family 
roles. Gupta says that her husband is tak-
ing care of their son and home, "in tnany 
ways. defYing and challenging the stereo-
types that we have of South Asian men." 

Despite the challenges, Gupta empha-
sizes the many merits of teaching abroad. 
With no domestic obligations, she has the 
freedom to participate fully in academic 
and social life at Yale. She has relished the 
chance to listen to such "stars" as Jiirgen 
Habermas, who visited Yale last month, 
and has been taking advantage of the exten-
sive library resources here. She has learned 
about different pedagogical options: In 
India, most of her classes are taught as 
"a monologue," but after witnessing the 
interactive nature of Yale seminars, she 
hopes to better integrate her students into 
class discussion when she returns home. In 
addition, meeting colleagues at the Mac-
Millan Center and throughout the Yale 
faculty, she has formed a cross-cultural 
and cross-regional network of friends that 
she hopes to maintain. 

And when she misses aspects of Indian 
culture that are absent in New Haven-
the street food, the "buzz" of the October 
festival month 
she turns to Yale's active 
South Asian community.
