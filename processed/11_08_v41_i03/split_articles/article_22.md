â€¢ THE 
RITI 
The largest collection of cuneiform 
day tablets in the Western Hemisphere 
is crannied away in a corner of the third 
floor of Sterling Memorial Library, and 
even though Yale is among the best places 
in the world to study Assyriology, there 
simply are not that many Assyriologists, 
and it shows. When, in early September, 
I first tried to find my way to the Baby-
lonian Collection, neither the attendants 
at Sterling's front desk nor the guard out-
side the Stacks knew where it was, nor is 
its location listed on all of the reference 
. maps in Sterling's nave, and, despite the 
library's otherwise resplendent aesthet-
ics, the empty hallway that led me to The 
Epic of Gilgamesh flaunted only burnt-
out light bulbs and a puddle of pungent 
water courtesy of a corroded bathroom 
pipe whose appearance suggested that it, 
too, was a Mesopotamian relic. Of course 
I startled the curator, Ulla Kasten, when I 
opened the door to the exhibition room 
(''I'm sorry," she said, jumping from her 
desk, "I just wasn't expecting anyone"), 
and of course I surprised her by being 
an English major ("Students of literature 
never remember that literature begins with 
the Sumerians"), and of course I elated her 
when I began to examine a Babylonian 
figurine ("Feel free to read all my labels; 
nobody ever does anyhow"). Of course a 
forgotten civilization would have a forgot-
ten collection.

The oldest writing in the world is, as far 
as I can tell, exactly like the newest writ-
ing except that it looks sloppier. That's 
partly due to the medium; writing on wet 
clay was an inhere~tly journalistic enter-
prise because, under the Fertile Crescent's 
scorching sun, it wasn't too long before 
that clay began to dry just try chiseling 
a story on a slab of hardened earth with a 
water reed and you'll forgive the Sumer-
ians for not crossing every t. (That said, if 
a scribe made a mistake, he could moisten 
the clay and revise, but this resulted in a 
curious side effect. The most rewritten 
parts of the tablet are also the thinnest-
their clay whittled down from repeated 
washing and writing 
and so we can suss 
out just how persistently an author strove 
to find his mot juste.) In any case, the 
writers of old engaged in the confronta-
tion of challenging ideas, using rhetoric, 
irony, humor, and metaphor in the same 
way we do. Their inventions became our 
conventions. 


Most of the displayable collection sits 
behind glass cases in a rather uninspiring 
room. If not for a pair of elegant window-
panes, one depicting a Babylonian sphinx, 
the other a royal retinue, you might forget 
that the objects on show are very valuable 
and very old. The newest date _from circa 
1 CE, the oldest from 3,000 years earlier. 
Some 40,000 other tablets are hidden 
offstage, in an archive so weighty that its 
floor has been reinforced in concrete. 


One of the larger tablets clamored for 
my attention; it had a yellower tint than 
its compatriots, lustrous and inviting and 
exuding self-confidence. It was an un-
mistakable commodity: the world's first 
recipe. "In some sense, writing developed 
for that recipe," Kasten told me. As vil-
lages grew into towns, and there were too 
many people to know everyone's business, 
the Sumerians developed a basic inethod 
of recording food production: the original 
bookkeeping. Soon, writing expanded be-
yond a mere instrument of tabulation for 
Abednago's sheep and Balthazar's onions. 
No longer content with discussing how 
much food was produced and who had 
it, some savvy scribe decided to explain 
what to do with it. The recipe tablet is 
flanked by other ancient objects: a water 
basin, a rattle, a gameboard, an adoption 
contract, the story of a jealous marriage, 
each and every artifact or panel the result 
of handiwork, each and every handiwork-
er sustained by food, the very food whose 
dissemination was aided by the creation 
of writing and whose preparation was 
abetted by these instructions for making 
pigeon stew." Pigeon stew! "The haute cui-
sine of Mesopotamia," according to the 
curatorial description. Can you imagine 
Sumerian epicureans eking out their liveli-
hoods in pursuit of this ambrosial nectar? 
We can make it, too. Thanks to Kasten's
