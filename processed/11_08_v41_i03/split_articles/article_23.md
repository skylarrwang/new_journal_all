EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
unread labels, the age of enlightenment is 
upon us all (but forgive the terseness, per-
haps another byproduct of rapidly drying 
clay tablets): 
"Take a pigeon. Split it in half. Also pre-
pare some red meat. Boil water, throw in 
fat, and add herbs and spices ... " 
So our recipes have improved. But the 
idea of a recipe has not changed. 

I see Hammurabi, lying atop 
a bed of virgins and saying 
something like, c1 don't make 
the rules, I just enforce them, " 
before reaching for another 
bowl of pigeon stew. 

Other wonders abound. I was par-
ticularly moved by a tablet describing 
extispicy, the science of interpreting the 
future through the entrails of sacrificed 
animals (a practice which has since become 
illegal, unless you use road kill). Another 
tablet calculates the ratio of the sides of 
an isosceles right triangle, a mathematical 
discovery falsely attributed to the Greeks. 
The formidable stele of the code of King 
Hammurabi, slightly removed from the 
rest of the collection and situated next to a 
stack of tomes that describe the economic 
and social history of the Orient, has a bas-
relief of Hammurabi's encounter with the 
sun god. (Unlike the rest of the collection, 
this stele is just a copy; blame the French.) 

King Hammurabi claimed that his law 
code was divine, which is a magnificent 
self-defense, because even if the laws are 
intensely disagreeable, one cannot shoot 
God's messenger. I see Hammurabi, lying 
atop a bed of virgins and saying something 
like, "I don't make the rules, I just enforce 
them," before reaching for another bowl 
of pigeon stew. 

That God's law is untouchable is not 
the only thing the Babylonians figured 
out first. One tablet is has a selection from 
1he Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest 
poems to feature a god using a flood to 
make a tabula rasa. In this room we have 
divine law, a deluge, a legal precursor to 
the Torah and the Ten Commandments, 
a water laver for ablutions like those de-
scribed in the Hebrew Bible, and, for that 
matter, a description of Mesopotamian 
temples conspicuously similar to the al-
leged form of the one in Ancient Israel. 

I see the religion of my grandparents, 
November 2008 
the creeds and rituals that buoyed them 
through pogroms and wars and depres-
sions and genocides, the all-sustaining be-
liefs shared by their grandparents and by 
their grandparents' grandparents in an ap-
parently unbroken chain for thousands of 
years. I see that the convictions for which 
my faithful ancestors of generations past 
_ would have sacrificed their lives (in def-
erence to the magnificent innovation of 
those wayward Israelites and the infinite 
wisdom of their fetterless God) were actu-
ally convictions that my ancient relatives~ 
probably borrowed from the Babylonians. 

The timeworn foundations ofWestern ju-
risprudence were wrested from unknown 
and unknowable stone slabs that sit idly 
in a nondescript room separated from ev-
ery synagogue and church and courthouse 
proudly displaying the Ten Command-
ments, separated indeed from the world at 
large, by a pool of toilet water. 

Not everyone has forgotten. I have 
gravitated to the collection a few times 
in the two months since I discovered it. 
The water has long since been mopped up 
and most of the light bulbs replaced, but 
I still find myself the only one there, so I 
wonder: How many of Yale's world-class 
resources go unnoticed? This can't be the 
only one. When I go, I always stand before 
a small and fractured stone slab. It is a sort 
of prayer, the label explains, that would 
have been set befo_re the statue of a god: 
"I am a scholar, but whatever I have 
been taught has turned into drivel for me. 
My hand for writing is gone, my mouth is 
not up to discourse. I am not old, but my 
hearing is thick, my look cross-eyed ... " 

It may come as no encouragement that 
educational discontent is as old as educa-
tion. But, I assure you, I have never felt so 
perfectly connected to the course of hu-
man history as when I commiserated with 
that ancient Babylonian.
