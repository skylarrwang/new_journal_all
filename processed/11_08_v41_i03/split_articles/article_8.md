CHIMES OF 
PASSION 
One day in the middle of the 1950s, 
after a career performing small roles on 
Broadway and Swedish dialect parts in 
radio shows, Robyna Neilson Ketchum 
stopped smoking and announced that she 
. 
would collect bells in order to fill the void. 
The decision was not entirely out of the 
blue, her husband wrote after her death 
in 1975. As a child growing up in Min-
. nesota, Ms. Ketchum had loved "antiques 
and echoes." It was not surprising, then, 
that she would one day come to be known 
as the "Bell Lady" and that her collection 
would "be Enshrined at Yale among the 
·World's Greatest Instruments.'' 
When people visit Yale's Collection of 
Musical Instruments in an ornate stone 
house on Hillhouse Avenue in New Ha-
ven, they generally flock upstairs to see the 
pianos, harpsichords, and clavichords, or 
meander downstairs amidst Stradivarii and 
early American piccolos. Few visitors enter 
a small room to the right of the entrance 
that displays about half of Ketchum's col-
lection of over four hundred bells from 
around the world. Once a harpsichord 
studio, the room was redesigned to house 
the bells after Ketchum died. Its black 
walls disappear into the ceiling and creep 
quietly into the corners, making way for 
well-lit display cases and, in the center, an 
austere square platform strewn with bul-
bous sound-makers. 

The bells that line the cases come in 
every shape and ring. in every tone. Susan 
E. Thompson, a curator at the museum, 
is not herself a campanologist, but she 
knows her bells (or, to be technical about 
it, her idiophones). "Most people come 
in thinking that bells have to · have clap-
pers," Thompson tells me, referring to the 
. dangling, clanging part inside many bdls . . 
"Well, they don't!" She picks up a mbonga 
from Central Africa to reveal its empty in~ 
terior. All you have to do is strike it and 
it reverberates. Maybe that's what drew 
Ketchum to these instruments 
their ac-
cessibility. Bells don't require extensive 
musical training to play; just a flick of the 
wrist or a tap of a stick will do. Ping! Ririg! 
Donngg. What satisfying little things. And 
they can be scintillating beyond sound. 

Thompson pulls a Japanese rattle off the 
wall and notes, "I have to be careful to dis-
play this one on the right side.'~ The "right" 
·side has Chinese characters engraved on 
large, round, coin-like surfaces. The wrong 
side seems to be just squiggles 
squiggles 
which, at second glance, are clearly depic-
tions of four different sexual positions. 

Thompson takes the handle and shakes 
the rattle in the air 
"Fertility!" 

In this room full -of handles, I begin to 
imagine hands. Here, a hand emerging 
from the orange robes of a Buddhist monk 
on pilgrimage. There, the calloused hand 
of a Swiss farmer. The hand of an African 
witch doctor next to that of an Italian 
priest. All ringing, striking, shaking bells. 

A French businessman taps his gaudy 
desk bell, which is topped with a scant-
ily clad Native American warrior. Nurses 
walk around hospital corridors Clanging 
heavy, nurse-shaped bells in 19th-century 
England. · Who, I wonder, shook the bell 
shaped like an Iron Maiden, the vicious 
18th-century German torture device? Ex-
amining the labels, I realize that the cast 
of missing music-makers is actually an 
interspecies bunch. There are bells, now 
dormant, that once hung on the necks of 
Scandinavian cows and the legs ofThai el-
ephants. 

More evocative than the bells them-
selves are the sounds they produce. While 
most of the bells remain behind glass cas-
es, their collective capabilities can be heard 
in a soundscape that plays from speakers 
mounted on a fireplace in the back of the 
room. More than one thousand years of 
sacred and profane sounds ring, arhyth-
mically, atonally. Some summon, others 
warn. Waves of slow, almost aquatic bass 
notes vibrate beneath the quick tingling of 
metallic chimes. There is s?mething calm 
and contemplative in these invisibly ris-
ing a~d subsiding . tones, but tfi'ere is also 
something~grand and urgent and compli-
cated. At ~imes I feel as if I'~ in engaged 
in some chaotic, multicu1tural ·ceremony 
with a million different rituMs and a mil-
lion different paths to transcendence, I am 
suddenly struck by the phrase "the ring of 
truth.'' 

Scholars come to the Bell Room to de-
cipher all kinds of mysteries 
to exam-
ine symbols on various Buddhist bells and 
Japanese gongs or to of!er theories ~m the 
possible connection between ancient Peru-
vian bells and similar vers.ions from South-
e~t Asia, sketching out unusual lines of 
human migration. The Bell Room, it 
turn~ out, offers a crash course in, among 
other disciplines, wodd religion, metal-
lurgy, and global history. There is . some 
doubt, though, as to the legitimacy of all 
the labels. "She says they're from Japan," 
Thompson says, looking skeptically at a set 
of handbells. The. "she" in question is, of 
course, Ms. Ketchum, on whose original 
labels the understaffed Collection of Mu-
sical Instruments has had to rely. 

I wonder again about Robyna Ketchum. 
Why bells? Was this her way of traveling 
the world? Of vicariously experiencing 
ceremonies and systems from across time? 
Venturing into the sonic unknown? The 
very last bell in the room's longest display 
case is, perhaps, the only one of truly in-
disputable origin. It belongs to an identi-
fiable time and place. It is a bell for the 
US Bicentenntial, designed by Ketchum 
herself just before her death. It is small 
and golden, decorated with an eagle, stars, 
and patriotic phrases 
a hand bell remi-
niscent of the Liberty Bell, and one of the 
few artifacts in the room that I think I un-
derstand. I give it a ring. I never did hear 
Robyna Ketchum the Broadway singer or 
Robyna Ketchum the radio character, but 
as a bell, Robyna Ketchum sounds crisp 
and bright.
