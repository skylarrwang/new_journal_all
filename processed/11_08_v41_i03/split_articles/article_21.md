Meanwhile, John Higgins is watching 
from the systems side that Yalies do not 
see. Higgins, Yale's Systems Engineer, . 
oversees the programming of the Uni-
versity's increasingly sophisticated HVAC 
(heating, ventilation, and air condition-
ing) climate-control systems, which deter-
mine the flow of steam arid chilled water 
from the power plants to buildings across 
campus. The HVAC systems of separate 
buildings are linked through a web-based 
central computer program called Backnet. 
Higgins opens Backnet and pulls up my 
college, Jonathan Edwards. It's a fairly 
simple diagram showing the flow between

valves, pumps, and heat exchangers in the 
college. "Delta T is twelve degrees," Hig-. 
gins announces with satisfaction, referring 
to the temperature change of the build-
ing's hot water. Then he turns to me to 
make sure: "Is it comfortable?" 


Higgins describes himself as "not a 
rock-the-boat person," which makes him 
well-suited to his job. Like production in 
the power plants, climate control is sup-
posed to be invisible. "HVAC is one· of 
those things · no one ever calls . you up 
and says you're doing a good job. So if you 
don't hear from a building you figure it's 
running pretty well." 


Higgins' assumption is understandable, 
but is it valid? As long as Yale's energy en-
gineers keep doing their job, the enormoq,s 
costs and emissions associated with energy 
consumption will remain invisible to those 
whose behavior determines demand and 
thus dictates the mechanics of building 
control. But how can the mechanics side 
talk back and change this behavior? 


The question points · to a truth that 
echoes in the words of Muir and others: 
while Yale's chiller nibes may be running 
smoothly, the channels of communication 
remain plugged. Most of the time, com-
munication is a one-way st.reet. While in-
side the power plants, Yale's demands ring 
loud and clear, Muir's and Starr's message 
to the Yale community barely makes it past 
the power plant gates. On the other side, 
Yalies become aware of the energy system 
only when it doesn't work for them 
then they ((talk back" to the system by 
opening a window. Yale's energy makers 
and energy consumers are largely alien to 
each other. Someone must bridge the gap 
between them 
and that someone may be 
those who, for now, largely represent the 
problem: Yale's students. 


LAsT YEAR, WITH the help of Bob Ferretti, 
the Education and Outreach Manager at 
the Yale Office of Sustainability and my 
former supervisor,· STEP pushed for mod~ 
est improvements that would bring poten-
tially big energy savings.-Capping the few 
chimneys left open around campus and 
insulating drafty windows and doors are 
the easy measures, the "low-hanging fruit" 
that Yale has yet to pick clean. STEP took 
its case all the way to John Bollier, the 
powerful associate vice president of Facili-
ties. The work paid off. '"We are tightening 
the envelope," Ferretti assures me, and "it 
wouldn't have happened without STEP." 


As part of the team that approached 
Bollier, I was surprised to find that he took 
us seriously. He didn't just humor us. He 
listened intensely to our ideas and, when 
he approved, made things happen. Hav-
ing grown accustomed to a campus where, 
over centuries, tradition has deposited 
resistance to change in every nook and 
cranny of Yale's operations, I thought his 
response something of a miracle. 


Strangely, STEP has been most effec-
tive not in changing student behavior·-
the original goal of group 
but instead 
in changing Yale's mechanical systems. But 
these mechanical changes are themselves a 
form ofbehavioral change 
one that, un-
usually, brings administrators, engineers, 
and students all to the same table. And 
in building these new channels of com-
munications, ·students are proving the 
keystone. Ferretti helped me understand: 
Bollier listened to STEP not because we 
were experts but because we were students, 
talking with him face-to-face.
