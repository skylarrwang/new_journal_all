hot gas is, and then through the headers 
where the steam is actually collected .... So 
anything that could potentially be wrong 
with the boiler is caught with an inspec-
tion like this before it actually manifests · 
itself in a failure of the equipment." 

Down in the plant, Starr displays . evi-
dence of the massive scale of plant main-
tenance. He points out a chiller that is 
opened up for cleaning, a large cylinder 
that contains 15,000 25-foot-long met-
al tubes. The tubes hold water, which is 
chilled by a refrigerant and then shipped 
campus-wide to buildings for air condi-
tioning. But the inside walls of the tubes 
collect deposits, which impede the transfer 
of heat from the water to the refrigerant 
and make the chiller less efficient. Starr 
reaches into a nearby box and picks up a 
stiff, blue, giant-pipe-cleaner of a brush. 
Once a year, workers must run such a 
brush down the entire length of each of the 
15,000 tubes 
twice. And this is just one 
of five chillers in Central Power Plant. 

As the planning begins for the 
two new residential colleges 
and the new School of Man-
agement campus, Downing, 
along with Olmstead and oth-
ers, is pushing for designs that 
will be amenable to installa-
tions like wind turbines. 

Knowing my biases, Starr has shown 
me the chiller cleaning process to teach 
me a lesson. While I'm busy worrying 
that reliability trumps efficiency at Cen-
tral, its engineers see efficiency in every 
detail of the plant, on scales both minute 
and grand. And such an eye to efficiency 
doesn't always clash with the plant's more 
urgent priority of reliability: Sometimes, 
efficiency and reliability work together. At 
the end of the day, running a blue plastic 
brush down 15,000 25-foot-long tubes is, 
in terms of emissions reduction, one of the 
best things we can do. 

As MUCH AS YALE demands of its· power 
plants, it doesn't exactly roll out the red 
carpet for them. At Sterling Power Plant, 
an easy-to-miss complex on Congress Av-
enue, Assistant Manager Jess Muir points 
out a second-story window to a concrete 
lot below. "See that? Underneath there is 
November 2008 
a 3.5-million-gallon tank." The under-
ground tank, once used to store chilled 
water, has stood empty for years and now 
sits beneath a parking lot and a tennis 
court. Soon, the tank will hold two huge 
cogeneration units. Each will produce 7.5 
megawatts of electricity and save 20,000 
metric tons of carbon equivalent a year-
comparable to the emissions of over 3,500 
cars .. 

"Imagine a regular truck container," 
says Muir in his sharp, energetic Scottish 
accent. Each cogen unit is "slightly big-
ger than that. It's basically a jet engine 
in a box." Two jet engines, each in a box, 
all inside a bigger box, underground: It 
sounds potentially disastrous. Extracting 
some of the equipment for repairs, Muir 
admits, could get tricky, but there aren't 
many other potential cogen sites on Yale's 
crowded and ambitiously expanding cam-
pus. Witnessing the efforts needed to get 
permission to raze the tennis court, Muir 
learned a valuable lesson: When the Yale 
community demands energy, you make it 
happen 
but it better not get in anyone's 
way. 

Take, for instance, the new chiller 
plant, now slated for a site in Science Park, 
which will allow the University to more 
than double Central Power Plant's peak air 
conditioning production. Even after the 
project's benefit had been acknowledged, 
it wasn't easy to secure the property. "That 
facility had to compete with a lot of other 
building plans for the site," says Sam Olm-
stead, Yale's head of Utilities Engineering. 
"It's not like we're going to bump a class-
room for a chiller plant. So finding a home 
for it was challenging." Classrooms truinp 
chiller plants, but classrooms also need 
chiller plants. The problem stems partly 
from the limited local space available for 
Yale's Manifest Destiny, and also from an 
attitude that urban planners call, "Not In 
My Back Yard." 

"NIMBYs," scoffs Tom Downing, Yale's 
senior energy engineer. Downing's office, 
cluttered with diagrams of fuel cells, bro-
chures for evacuated solar tubes, and a 
thin-film photovoltaic solar panel leaning 
against one wall, reveals an obsession with 
alternative energy that exceeds his job de-
scription. He directs his NIMBY comment 
toward Yale's reluctance to place wind tur-
bines anywhere visible on its architecw r-
ally finicky campus. The same term applies 
to anything from sewage treatment plants 
to power plants. Everybody needs them, 
but nobody wants to see them.

But wind turbines and solar panels, 
both visually iconic clean energy sources, 
should hold the most potential for over-
coming NIMBYism. They are something 
to show off especially considering the 
publicity attached to Levin's greenhouse 
gas commitment, the strategy for which 
emphasizes on-campus renewable energy 
' 
installations. Downing wants to create 
space, both aesthetic and geographic, for 
the projects that Yale theoretically sup-
ports. As the planning begins for the 
two new residential colleges and the new 
School of Management campus, Down-
ing, along with Olmstead and others, 
is pushing for designs that will be ame-
nable to installations like wind turbines. 

Currendy, Downing is in the process of 
installing a series of ten -micro-wind tur-
bines 
the plan for which, after being 
bounced around Science Hill in a game of 
blueprint hot potato, has finally found a 
future home on top of Becton. Not as vis-
ible as Downing would have liked, but it's 
better than nothing. 

But micro-wind turbines won't get Yale 
to its emissions goal any faster than will 
brushing out 15,000 chiller tubes. At one 
kilowatt (that's one-thousandth of a mega-
watt) each, Downing's turbines might 
cover at most 5 percent of Becton's energy 
consumption. As everyone agrees, there is 
no silver bullet, but instead a mix of many 
small solutions that, together, start to add 
up. 

Still, "small" is a relative term. Yale 
could have installed a hundred micro-tur-
bines by now, instead of a barely-approved 
plan for ten. The "no silver bullet" mantra 
serves as a convenient excuse, hiding the 
nagging suspicion that Yale isn't willing to 
make big sacrifices to reduce energy use 
or to rethink the way it consumes and ex-
pands. Is Yale making the changes neces-
sary to reach its celebrated goal? 

"I don't know," Muir responds. "I don't 
see it. All I see is these numbers here." He 
gestures to his computer screen, where an 
endless spreadsheet records Yale's energy 
production data: 6.5 million cubic feet 
of natural gas burned in a single day this 
summer, producing 17 megawatts of elec-
tricity, 17,000 tons of chilled water, and 
5.5 million pounds of steam and that's 
just for Sterling Power Plant. Starr is more 
political than Muir, but no more optimis-
tic. "I don't see any ability to meet needs 
in a non-conventional fashion," he says. 

Starr is overseeing the installation of two 
new conventional boilers at Central Power

Plant. As tempted as I am to condemn 
them, there is nothing wrong with the 
boilers themselves. They will be the most 
efficient models around, and, like the new 
Science Park chiller plant, they're wanted 
partly to increase firm capacity. The boilers 
themselves aren't causing Yale's skyrocket-
ing steam consumption; they are only an-
swering it. 

c'My ultimate goal :1:1 Muir 
continues with a frustrated 
yet hopeful smile~ c'would be ... 
to walk out of here~ lock the

ment. 

All new Yale buildings must now meet 
the widely used LEED standard for sus-
tainable design, but even LEED-certified 
buildings use a substantial amount of 
energy: More development means more 
power plant demand. Planners like Down-
ing and Olmstead must do what they can, 
given the no-arguments-allowed expan-
sion plans that land on their desks. ''All of 
our reductions have to take place agaiQst 
that backdrop," says Olmstead. 

"We're very keenly aware of the energy 
we're producing," Muir laments, "but it's 
our job to produce whatever is needed." 
And Yale needs a lot. "My ultimate goal," 
Muir continues with a frustrated yet hope-
ful smile, "would be ... to walk out of here, 
lock the door and say, 'You don't need me 
anymore.' I would love nothing better 
than to shut down all this polluting equip-
ment. , 

Yale's Utilities and Facilities Depart-
ments claims some of the University's tru-
est believers in reducing emissions. Energy 
professionals, more than anyone, see the 
dirty underbelly of consumption 
and 
the darker side ofYale's obliviousness. 

MurR AND STARR don't just want the Yale 
administration to pay more attention. 
They want individuals to reduce their per-
sonal consumption 
and also to speak up, 
to call out the University when it lapses 
and to push for change. "You see windows 
open during winter, you see windows open 
during summer when you know the air 
conditioning's on 
and it just kills you," 
says Starr. 

The "open windows" refrain, which 
echoes through the ranks of Yale's energy 
engineers, is a criticism more profound 
than it might seem. Open windows are 
both a symptom and a cause of energy-
inefficient buildings. Buildings with an-
tiquated temperature controls or drafty 
windows and doors run heating systems 
unevenly and thus inefficiently; when 
people in the hot parts of a building open 
windows, the building senses colder air 
and responds by pumping in more heat. 
The guilt lies both in the decision to open 
a window and in the failure to demand 
better heating systems in Yale's buildings, 
resulting in what Muir calls "energy pissed 
" 
away. 

"Open windows" is code not for lazi-
ness but for blindness. Because Yalies don't 
see the systems that serve them, they don't 
think of an overheated building as some-
