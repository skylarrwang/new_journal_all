for an expletive on the air, and a missed sta-
tion ID at the top of the hour comes with 
a similarly hefty pricetag. The FCC gener-
ally doesn't waste limited resources moni- _ 
toring non-commercial college stations, 
but WYBC, thanks to its commercial FM 
branch, cannot slip through the cracks. 
Since the commercial station is YBC's sole 
source of revenue, its members are wary 
of doing anything that might cost them 
their broadcasting license and participate 
in a grueling training process geared to ad-
hering to FCC regulations. Until recently, 
training took an entire semester. A newly-
revised five-week program is more in line 
with other schools' requirements, but it is 
still a considerably more tedious and less 
hands-on experience. Both in form and 
in content, WYBC has drifted from the 
scrappy reputation of college radio 
and 
also from the spirit that sustains it. -
And without a strong membership base, 
it's hard to generate a listener base. While 
the station currently has about 75 members 
and will probably add a few more after this 
training season, the numbers can be decep-
tive; many of these members don't work 
regularly, making it difficult for WYBC to 
November 2008 
a fill its schedule with original program-
ming. Although the station broadcasts 24 
hours a day, it is only live from 6-11 p.m. 
during the school week, with a couple of 
other shows scattered at other times. An 
autocaster takes over unmanned shifts, but 
the machine's pop-heavy playlist is "not 
~ 
the kind of music the campus would be 
interested in," says Gliwa. 

In an effort to woo and retain members, 
WYBC has sacrificed programming struc-
ture. "We might have a rock show next to 
a sports talk show, back to back with an 
electronic music show," Malter explains. 
Gliwa also decries the chaotic schedule. 
"It makes it impossible to casually listen to 
WYBC," she says. 

BuT A YALE RADIO revival may be drift-
ing on the not-so-distant horizon. The 
answer, like all answers these days, will 
be Google-able. WYBC-X, an internet 
stream, is set to launch in January. The 
X-stream, which Devoe calls "the future 
of radio," will take on the AM station's 
role as an outlet for student broadcasting. 
Although the station currently simul-
casts over the internet, the new stream 
â€¢ 
will contain downloadable podcasts of 
archived shows. 
A hockey match isnt the only 
event best appreciated live. A 
Yale broadcaster could have 
captured Grant Park the 
night of November -i or the 
700 Yalies singing wlhe Star-
Spangled Banner~~ early the 
next mornin~ in a way that 
no newspaper reporter could. 
"People will be able to listen on their 
iPhones," says Malter. Or on their com-
puters, iPods, or any other mp3 player. 
The makeover might also render WYBC 
more appealing to would-be members. 
Unlike its AM or FM counterparts, the 
internet stream requires neither broadcast-
quality radio equipment nor strict compli-
ance with FCC mandates. "We can bend 
some of the rules," says Owczarek with a
