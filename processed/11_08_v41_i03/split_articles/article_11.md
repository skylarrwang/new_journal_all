CHEER AND 
LOATHING 
As a high school senior attending Bull-
dog Days, Michelle Wolfe DC '11 knew 
that she wanted to join the cheer squad. 
But when she asked her Bulldog Days host 
about Yale cheerleading, Wolfe, who was 
a varsity cheerleader at her high school, 
was disappointed to hear that the Univer-
sity apparently didn't have a squad. At the 
next day's extracurricular bazaar, however, 
she came across an enthusiastic group of 
Yale undergraduates brandishing a "Yale 
Cheerleading" sign. 
"My host didn't think there was one," 
Wolfe says. ''And I still get the same reac-
tions from people when I tell them I am 
on the cheerleading team. It seems 'to be a 
confusing and surprising concept because 
some hadn't realized that Yale even had 
cheerleaders!" 
Yalies may be oblivious to their school's 
small but active cheer culture because they 
don't attend games, or because they cave 
to popular stereotypes of cheerleaders and 
assume that such a culture cannot ·exist 
within Yale's Gothic towers and legendary 
libraries. Many would be surprised, how-
ever, to find that Yale's cheer squad is en-
trenched in a near-century of history. 
Originally a band of "yell-leaders" who 
November 2008 
frequented intercollegiate athletic events, 
the Yale Cheerleading Squad officially 
formed in 1912. Since the school didn't 
go co-ed untill969, these early cheerlead-
. ers were, like most Yalies at the time, male 
. students from elite secondary schools. 
The Bush men 
Prescott Sheldon Bush 
'16, George H. W. Bush '48,. and George 
W. Bush '68 
were all avid members of 
the Yale Cheerleading Squad; a picture of 
Sheldon Bush mid-cheer is tucked in away 
in Sterling Library's Manuscripts and Ar-
chives. In those early years, cheerleaders 
embodied not only school spirit but also 
masculinity and leadership, and they re-
ceived wide respect and admiration from 
the student body 
Anyone who has ever seen Bring It On, 
Bring It On Again, Bring It On: All Or 
Nothing, or Bring It On: In It To Win It 
is familiar with the archetypal American 
cheerleader: blonde, peppy, and subject 
to vicious social laws. Many members of 
Yale's cheer squad complain that people 
who don't know them personally make 
assumptions about their intelligence and 
sincerity based on their pastime. 
Even for Kimberlee Sheldon BK '1 0, 
who grew up in England, such American 
media portrayals are a cultural landmark. 
"I saw in all these American films that 
cheerleaders in high school were kind of 
bimbo-y and often were the popular girls 
with mean personalities," Sheldon says. 
"But I thought that might be different on 
a college level." 
Such films in fact encouraged Sheldon 
to try cheerleading what better way to 
immerse oneself in apple-pie Americana 
than by cheering at football games? · Bu~ 
she was disappointed to discover that the 
activity was not quite as popular at Yale 
as she'd imagined. "Yale girls tend to have 
hostile reactions toward cheerleading," 
Sheldon explains. "When we are trying to 
recruit and approach random girls to ask if 
they are interested in joining, some would 
go, 'Eww; no, why would I want to do 
that?' I could see this happening in high 
school, but this is really redundant here: I 
mean, we are all at Yale." 
Co-captain Lindsay Barbee TC '09 be-
lieves that Yale cheerleaders defy the ste-
reotypes. "Since a young age, cheerleaders 
are sort of the Gossip Girls of high school. 
They are hot, slutty, stupid, and popular," 
she says. "Perhaps some cheerleaders act 
that way, but not all, and definitely not 
Yale Cheer. While many of my teammates 
are quite stunning," Barbee continues, 
'·'we don't ever attempt to exude a sexy im-
age. We are bouncy, we are sharp, we are 
cute. " 
Male cheerleaders battle stereotypes as 
well, but of an entirely different nature. 
Grant Goodlin PC '10, although aware of 
the popular assumption that stuntmen are 
gay, has not experienced more than mild 
surprise from anyone who has found out 
that . he joined the squad this year. "But' 
I've gotten some great reactions," he says. 
''And I hear stuff like, 'Way to go, Grant! 
I thought that cheerleading was only for 
girls!' and 'Introduce me to some of your 
new friends."' 
Last year, former stuntman Phil Clop-
ton MC '08 won the honored title of Mr. 
Yale, which the cheer squad now uses as a 
recruiting point for future stuntmen: "Mr. 
Yale was a cheerleader!" they tell recruits. 
And the Yale name, of course, goes a 
long way to dissolve various other side 
effects of the Bring It On franchise. "We 
are cheerleaders," Barbee says, "but we are 
Yale cheerleaders. Clearly the Yale comes 
first."

**Sunday Night Lights**
**Author: Kate Selker**

SUNDAY NIGHT 
LIGHTS 
Christ Church draws its largest crowd 
of the week to sit in the dark and stare at 
an empty altar. Every Sunday at 9 p.m., 
there are multicolored candles, sweet in-
cense, and entrancing music. But there 
is no minister, no Bible, and no choir in 
sight. The crowd at the Compline service 
is decidedly non-churchy, though a few 
genuflect and make the sign of the cross 
before sitting. Most are young 
twenty-
somethings in couples and small groups, 
7 
wearing sweatshirts and high heeled boots. 
This crowd seems less interested in God 
than in music, light, and calm . 
In such an empty, cavernous church, 
footsteps and whispers sound vaguely me-
h>dic. For a few minutes, the only sounds 
are the taking-off of coats, the unzipping 
of zippers, the placing of backpacks into 
chairs. When the real music begins, it is 
cryptic, merely a low, vibrating note. The 
singers are unseen in · a balcony above 
the pews, and, slowly, words begin ·to 
form. Voices chant, "Arne 
nnn." Plain-
song, the style of liturgical chant sung at 
Compline, involves a single melody and 
no instrumental accompaniment. It's a 
non-Whiffenpoof sort of a capella, with 
l9w tones that rise to the high ribs of the 
church ceiling 
"Lord, have mercy upon 
us" 
female notes blending like chimes 
into the deep swell of male voices. "Glory 
be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the 
Holy Ghost .... " 
The lyrics change by season, according 
to the customs of the centuries-old mo-
nastic orders of St. Benedict. For over a 
thousand years, Compline services have 
been part of a cycle of prayer and music 
to mark the end of the day, the last of 
eight canonical Hours performed by the 
Christian church. Christ Church, accord-
• 
ing to its website, se~s Compline as "the 
sole point of calm in a hectic week," meant 
for "a new kind of worshipper." It posts 
podcasts of sermons online and welcomes 
seekers into the "loving, growing family'' 
of the church. 
Reverend Kathryn Reinhard hopes that 
the service targets those who can't find the 
time to worship or who find church intim-
idating. "We get a big mix, a huge range of 
people ... .it's non-threatening, you don't 
have to sit, stand, and kneel, and there's 
no intermediary," she explains. 
"You can go to it as a Christian service if 
you want to, and see it as a place to pray," 
one Compline attendee suggests, "or just 
let it be a time to relax, or meditate, or 
just listen to the music. It really doesn't 
matter if you're atheist, Jewish, Muslim, 
nothing ... nobody will question you about 
why you're there." Still, Reinhard says, "I 
hope they start coming [to Christ Church] 
because of Compline." After the service, 
she teams with Divinity School volunteers 
to serve hot cider to visitors, hoping to 
create a sense of community among the 
group and thus draw them into the Christ 
Church fold. 
The eight Compline singers form their 
own community and call themselves 
"Team Compline." The service is reputed 
as a good singing gig, not least because 
each chorister receives $50 per session. 
Compline chorus alum Lucy Fitz Gibbon 
TD '1 0 calls the service "magical." But un-
like the listeners, her mind cannot wander. 
A "half-hour of intense concentration," 
Fitz Gibbon explains, is required to main-
tain the chant's precision. And with only 
eight singers, one member's slip-up will 
echo loudly through the silent church . 
The chorus is no more religious than 
its audience. Though he sings explicitly 
Christian lyrics, Neil Vasan MED '12, 
an agnostic, enjoys the music. "There are 
mentions of God and stuff like that, but 
it's pretty inviting," he explains. "You don't 
feel like you're being bombarded with oth-
er people's beliefs." 
So, unbombarded, the devout and the 
agnostic share the pews quietly, listening. 
And when Compline ends, it is still Sun"': 
day night. The week is about to start, or it 
has finally ended. There is work to be done. 
Eyes are woozy with darkness, minds lulled 
to sleepiness by the chanting. The singers 
remain immobile in their perch above the 
congregation until they hear the squeak 
of a floorboard or the grind of a chair. At 
the first sign of shifting, Team Compline 
begins to leave. Arid slowly, Fitz Gibbon 
says, "like little bugs out of the woodwork, 
people start trickling out," from the dark 
indoors to the darkness outside.
