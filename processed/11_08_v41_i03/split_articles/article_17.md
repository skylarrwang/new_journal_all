signed on over a thousand youth and adult 
members. 

Recognizing the Center's ~nique po-· 
tential to forge relationships between Yale 
students and their younger charges, Ellis 
hired freshman and sophomore interns 
"because I knew they would be there for 
three or four years and have that consis- · 
tency with the students and· establish a 
great relationship with the members." 

The strategy seems to have worked. "It 
was really meaningful," says former intern 
Nora Jacobsen SY '10. "It was not just 
tutoring where you're with the kid for an 
hour and you don't know them.:. this ·was 
such a connection. It was probably the 
only place on the Yale campus where you 
could get something like that, and it was

amazmg. 

Jeremy Harp TC '10, who played bas-
ketball with the Center's high school stu-
dents, agrees. "I learned so much," he says, 
'~and my views of how to reach older kids 
have changed." Interested in b~coming a 
civil rights attorney or community activ-
ist, Harp discovered the importance of 
sports as an arena "where men and youth 
bond" and where Yale students can teach 
local students ''the importance of educa-
tion." He was shocked by the social and 
psychological division· between his world 
and that of his charges. "I found it amaz-
ing that they live so close physically b1._1t 
they might as well be miles away," he says. 
"The bringing of the two worlds together 
is at the Dixwell Center." 

THROUGH THE DILIGENCE of its staff and 
interns, the DYCLC successfully bridged 
that invisible gulf between Yale and New 
Haven. Adedana Ashebir MC '09 remem-
bers· the mutuality of her experience in-
terning at the Center. "We did our best to 
share what we learned and they returned 
the favor, maybe even two-fold," she says. 
"It's the Dixwell-Yale Center." Each intern 
brought individual skills and interests. 
Ashebir took students to the Yale Uni-
versity Art Gallery and screened Saturday 
movies, and Harp played basketball with 
~e older boys and talked about how gang 
viOlence was affecting their lives. 

One semester, Jacobsen organized a tol-
erance discussion group to which she in-
vited members ofYale's Arab Students As-
sociation and Women's Center. While she 
knows that "you can't completely change 
kids all at once," she did see a tangible im-
pact that she attributed to the steady pres-
ence of the interns. ''A lot of the interns 
worked a lot of hours, and the kids really 
did get to know us, and when you say to 
them that Arabs aren't terrorists, that you 
have to respect homosexuals 
for that to 
come from someone they know is really 
important."

live so close physically but 
_they might as well be miles 
away ... The bringing o the 
two worlds together is at the

Center. " Jeremy

But despite strong student presence at 
the Center and the emerging coope;a-
tion with various Yale organizations, the 
ONHSA was not satisfied that the Center 
was fulfilling its potential. One problem, 
administrators worried, was discipline. 
Claudia Merson, the Public School Part-
nerships coordinator at the ONHSA, was 
concerned that the interns didn't "know 
what is natt_1ral entropy of children and 
what is disorganized." She cites occasional 
phone calls from parents about bullying 
at the Center, which she said "shouldn't 
even be a possibility." Control was so lax 
that the administration hired a retired po-
lice officer, Charles Barbour, to help keep 
things orderly. 

Ellis had a different take on Barbour's 
presence, remarking that "he was sort of a 
grandfather figure, helped to maintain dis-
cipline and order, helped a lot of students 
with their homework." 

Jacobsen agrees that he was "an excellent 
role model for the kids" who "related to 
them in a positive way." To her, discipline 
wasn't a problem. "Things were never out 
of control," she says. 

WHEN THE INTERNS returned to school 
this fall, they waited for the usual schedul-
ing email from Ellis. It never arrived. After 
a month of radio silence, the ONHSA in-
formed them that they needed to reapply 
for their positions. Merson admits that the 
failure of communication was "1 00 per-
cent my fault, I can own up. 'A piece of it 
was that I don't think any of us understood 
the arrangement the director had with the 
interns; it's the antithesis of everything I've 
encountered in this Office." Merson says 
she had expected interns to reapply on a

regular basis rather than having their con-
tracts automatically rolled over from year 
to year. 

The change in procedure left many of 
' 
the interns confused and hurt. "We all got 
the vibe that we weren't wanted. Wheth-

er or not t at s true, 
m not sure, says 
Ashebir. Unsure of their positions at the 
Center, former interns began frantically 
searching for other jobs to pay for books 
and to cover fall tuition. 

This frantic · search, Jacobsen explains, 
should have been avoidable. "Part of the 
responsibility ofYale to its students is that 
when they provide this kind of a job, they 
make sure that they deal with the stu-
dents responsibly and riot just as dispos-
able workers who go through here in four 
years," she says. "It's not just a job for us." 

Apart from their sudden unemploy-
ment, the former interns were most trou-
bled by their broken relationships with 
students at the Center. "It doesn't make 
sense for us to break ties with the youth so 
abruptly," Harp says. "I haven't talked with 
any of the kids since I left the Center last 
semester. I can find them on Myspace now 
but that's ·about it, and I've lost touch with 
some of the older kids who I was talking 
with about gangs." 

Claudia Merson, the Public 
School Partnerships coordina-
tor at the ONHSA, was con-
·cerned·that the interns didn't 
"know what is natural en-
tropy of children and what is 
disorganized. " 

When Jacobsen visited the Center ear-
lier this semester, she worried that the stu-
dents she had mentored felt abandoned. 
"There was one kid who was a foster kid 
and it just felt like another person who'd 
gone, that's the impression I got from 
him," she remembers. "I was pretty close 
to him by the end of last year ... It was 
hard, I was coming back from the sum-
mer really looking forward to that." She 
decided to cut contact after this last visit. 
"Some of them have been hurt a lot by 
people who have come in and out of their 
lives," Jacobsen explains. "I don't want to 
·· be one of those people." 

Morand defends the employee turnover 
by emphasizing that Ellis was hired on a 
year-to-year contract 
"which is not un-
usual in the world," he adds. He believes 
that the OHNSA honored both Ellis' con-
tract arid those of the interns, and at least 
one intern was re-accepted to work at the 
Center. 

That leaves at least two former interns 
who were not even granted interviews 
when they reapplied, though one had 
worked at the Center for four semesters 
as well as the summer, and the other had 
averaged fifteen hours a week the previous · 
year. The ONHSA readily admits that it 
mishandled the transition on a personal 
level, and Merson expresses her willing-
ness to help past interns find other posi:.. 
tions in education and service. 

The final decision-making, however, 
rested on Morand, who is quick to empha-
size that "it is important to focus on L in 
[DY] CLC, to structure the place with a fo-
cus on training and education. You might 
call it the education professionalization of 
the Center." Keeping in mind Moran~s 
goal of making the DYCLC "not a drop-
in center but a true learning center," the 
ONHSA decided to seek leadership based 
on professional education experience. 

"We were moving away from a 
student-run place, moving towards profes-
sional educators," Merson says, expressing 
a wish to educate l'\Ot just the Center's kids 
but its student interns. ''As models of an

excited learner," she continues, students 
interested in a career in education "can 
learn a lot from professional educators." 

The ONHSA is still searching for a per-
manent coordinator to direct the Center, 
but the background of }effie Frazier, the 
current interim director, offers a glimpse 
of the type of leader it· hopes to pursue. 
Morand describes Frazier as a "well-recog-
nized educator" who served as a principal 
in the New Haven School District for 23 
years before retiring from her post at Wex-
ler Grant High School. Frazier "knows the 
neighborhood, knows education," he says, 
and is beginning to create a "networked 
and plugged-in place" that is "part of a 
fabric, an ongoing conversation we have 
with the neighborhood with a focus on 
learning." 

Like its former interns, Frazier recog-
nizes the Center's potential to bring two 
worlds together and has tried to use the 
organization as a vehicle to bring Yale re-
sources to New Haven youth and to al-
low them to discover the neighborhood 
in which many of them have lived their 
whole lives. 

Frazier lowers her already-soft voice to 
an ardent whisper as she relates a trip she 
planned with a group of children from 
the Center. "We were going to the Grove 
Street Cemetery" 
across the street from 
the Center 
"and the kids were complain-
ing that it was too far away. I took them 
outside, and said 'Look! It's right there!' 
They had no idea it was so dose." 

FoR NOW, THE Center is operating with 
slightly scaled-back hours 
the after-
school program ends an hour earlier and 
the calendar shows no regular youth pro-
grams on Saturdays 
and no longer caters 
to students over 13. Ellis, still on the Cen-
ter's mailing list, expressed concern that 
she had not received any publicity materi-
als this semester. But she is trying not to 
look back. While she would like the former 
interns to be able to resume their positions 
at the Center, she herself is thinking of law 
school. An important step she thinks the 
ONHSA could take to avoid misunder-
standings like that which put the interns 
out of work is the formation of a board 
to monitor programming and hiring deci-
sions. The board might include Yale stu-
dents and faculty, she recommends, as well 
as "teachers, principals, police officers, li-
brarians, parents of youth members, and 
even a couple of youth members." 

"1here was one kid who was 
a oster kid and it just elt like 
another person who'd gone, 
that's the impression I got 
from him."

Much of the infrastructure that Ellis 
constructed, however, lives on, and Fra-
zier counts thirty students enrolled in the 
after-school program, 1 7 of whom attend 
regularly. 

The current interns have started initia-
tives of their own. Some practice music 
with children who are learning to play 
instruments, and Francesca Slade PC '1 0, 
who worked with One Laptop Per Child 
at MIT this summer, has begun teaching 
basic computer programming to stude!ltS 
at the Center. 

All of this comes as good news to the 
interns whose contracts were not renewed 
and whose semesters have been fraught 
with concerns for the Center's well-being. 
"The community needs to move on, these 
kids need to move on, and they need the 
Center," Jacobsen says. Along with Ellis 
and the other former interns, she's not 
protesting. She knows that's the last thing 
the Center needs.
