"You're listening to Poptimism." It's 
just after 7 on a Monday night and Catie 
Gliwa TC '11 is on the air. "Next up, MIA 
with 'Bamboo Banga' and, at risk of losing 
one of my three listeners, Miley Cyrus." As 
the last song fades 
"and I, I can't wait to 
see you again" 
Gliwa returns to the mic. 

"This is WYBC 1349 AM. You just heard 
Miley Cyrus with 'See You Again.' Hor-- -
ace, I hope you're still listening." 

Horace is her boyfriend. 

Gliwa underestimated her listener-
ship (after all, her mom always tunes in 
from Denver, and her co-editors at the 
Yale Daily News decided to play her show 
that night), but probably not by much. 

Although the Yale Broadcasting Com-
pany's 
commercial, 
professionally-run 
FM station ranks among the top three in 
New Haven, its AM student counterpart 
is struggling to find a listener base even 
within Yale's walls. 

But it hasn't always been this way. 
Du.ring World War II, Yale's closed-
circuit station was the university's primary 
news source. With the war came a·paper 
shortage, then paper rationing, which 
made printing a daily newspaper difficult, 
if not unpatriotic. The "Oldest College 
Daily" suspended its production as part of 
the war effort, so Yale Radio stepped in; 
the station upped its programming until, 
November 2008 
under order from the Yale College dean, it 
was broadcasting continuously. 

.. 
C was one of few media 
outlets to broadcast live from 
the New Haven Green on May 
Day 1970> when thousands 
of city residents converged 
to protest the trial of Bobby 
Seale and other members of 
the Black Panther movement. 

The wartime broadcasts coincided with 
the age of President Roosevelt's fireside 
chats, an era when "people would just sit 
down with their radios," Sean Owczarek 
SM '11, incoming general manager of 
YBC, explains. Owczarek, whose shaggy 
curls often fall across his right eye, may be 
just the man to recapture WYBC's once-
sexy reputation. 

He speaks of radio.--
especially Brown Student Radio, the sta-
tion of his childhood with a reverence 
most reserve for deities. He explains that 
Brown's legendary station, though broad-
cast two hundred miles from his home on 
Long Island, convinced him that radio was 
his destined medium. 

And since arriving on campus, he has 
worked to spread his faith in airwaves. 
"The guy came in super-enthusiastic," says 
current general manager Jordan Malter 
PC '09. "Now everyone is feeding off 
that enthusiasm." This zeal radiates from 
Owczarek as he describes the medium's 
heyday 
"the heart of radio" 
with 
something like nostalgia, though neither 
he, nor even his parents, were alive at the 
urn e. 

Ken Devoe SY '69 contends that radio's 
prime both at Yale and beyond 
lasted 
well beyond the war, despite the resump-
tion of the YDN and the proliferation of 
household TVs during the 1950s. Now 
serving on the station's Board of Gover-
nors, Devoe was a member ofWYBC from 
1967 until 1969 and worked in the radio 
industry for twenty years after his time 
at Yale. In the history he tells, Yale radio 
gained popularity within the larger New 
Haven community circa 1968, around the 
same time as the Summer ofLove and the 
legendary Woodstock Music Festival. Mu-
sic made up the bulk of programming by 
this time. "The music started to change," 
explains Devoe. "The stuff you now know 
as classic rock 
the stuff we liked 
was 
cutting edge then. We started playing it 
on the FM and were essentially the only 
station playing it. The listenership outside

Yale exploded." 

Until recently, training took 
an entire . semester. A newly-
-t:evised jive-week program is 
m'or,e in line with other schools' 
requirements, but it is still a 
considerably more tedious and 
less hands-on experience. 

The popularity of Yale Radio's music 
programming in the New Haven com-
munity and on campus brought money 
and fame to the station. As a result, other 
WYBC programming, especially the news 
department, flourished. "We did have a bit 
of a presence, staying on top of news and 
controversial issues," remembers Devoe .. 
1he department covered news not only on 
c;ampus but also across the country, inter-
viewing guests at Master's Teas as well as 
broadcasting live from the 1968 Demo-
cratic Convention in Chicago. WYBC was 
ore of few media outlets to broadcast live 
from the New Haven Green on May Day 
1970, when thousands of city residents:-
students and .citizens alike 
converged to 
protest the trial of Bobby Seale and other 
members of the Black Panther movement. 

Through its live coverage of events like 
these demonstrations · and the ensuing 
student protests, WYBC became a forum 
for countercultural expression, for dissent 
against both Yale University and the na-
tion at large. 

THE ZEITGEIST OF the '60s remade radio· . 
and helped to keep it alive during the ear-
ly '70s . . But as the Baby Boomers grew up 
and the national youth culture they had 
created began to dissipate, so the glory . 
days of radio began to wane. Now, in a 
world of iTunes and podcasts, listening 
to music on the radio can feel obsolete. 

So obsolete, in fact, that radios are slowly 
being phased out. Malter himself admits 
that the overwhelming majority ofYalies 
most likely do not own radios. 

Yet while WYBC flounders, many other 
college radio stations have remained in-
credibly successful. Owczarek's beloved 
Brown Student Radio boa.Sts a listenership 
of at least 4,000 per month, and even this 
figure, impressive by Yale Radio standards, 
could be an underestimate due to iT unes 
downloads that the station cannot track. 

Listenership is alluring. Campuses with 
thriving stations like ~rown's boast more 
DJs and more producers; some even have 
talk shows. "I have a lot of friends who 
do college radio who got stcuted bec!).use 
the station was so popular at their school," 
Gliwa explains. 

She cites competitive application pro-
cesses, like the one at the University of 
Chicago, where, according to its. website, 
prospective jockeys must submit a tWo-
hour playlist showcasing "unique and in-
teresting music that wouldn't otherwise be 
heard on commercial radio outlets." 

Once applicants make the cut, they 
fight for airtime. "One of my friends' first 
shifts was 2 to 4 a.m. because they give the 
freshmen the ones no one else wants," says 
Gliwa. That friend DJs at the University of 
Oregon, where radio programming is live 
24 hours a day, seven days ·a week. Even in_ 
the wee hours of Saturday morning, peo-· 
ple call or instant message with requests, a 
phenomenon that rarely occurs at WYBC 
even during primetime. 

The station's chaotic schedules 
"makes it impossible to casu-
ally listen to 
C, " says 
Catie Gliwa TC '11. 

Currently, the Yale station struggles not 
just for listeners but for members. Malter 
considers the low level of student interest 
one of the major problems plaguing the 
station. Many attribute declining mem-
bership to WYBC's move from Hendrie · 
Hall to an off-campus building at Temple 
and Crown Street in 2000. "It's a couple 
of blocks' walk, and I bet we lose a few for 
every block we are from campus," Malter 
says, only half-kidding. The facility's atmo-
sphere may also deter students. The office, 
shared by both the FM and AM teams, 
feels decidedly corporate. Its big leather 
chairs and conference rooms are emphati-
cally unlike a romanticized picture of a 
grungy college radio station, and WYBC 
is no longer "the place to hang out" that 
it was in Devoe's days. Most members 
come in just before their shows and leave 
directly after. While Devoe's closest friends 
are his colleagues from his WYBC days, 
today's station ~acks such a community; 
Gliwa notes that she only knows a couple 
of other DJs, both from connections out-
side ofWYBC. 

Broadcast restrictions may also intimi-
date prospective DJs. The Federal Com-
. munications Commission charges $5,000
