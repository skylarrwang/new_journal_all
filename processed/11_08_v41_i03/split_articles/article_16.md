At the end of this past May, with no 
warning, Makana Ellis TD '05 was fired. 
When her supervisor at Yale's Office . of -
New Haven and State Affairs (ONHSA) 
called her in to tell her that her contract 
would not be renewed, she had been 
working for over two and a half years as 
coordinator of the Dixwell-Yale Commu-
nity Learning Center (DYCLC), an initia-
tive that works to bridge the gap between 
Yale and the Elm City. "They told me they 
wanted to take the Center to another level," 
recalls Ellis, "but they never told me prior 
that what we were doing currendy wasn't 
what they were looking for." Ellis describes 
her reaction as one of frustration. "I was 
extremely disappointed, and ... saddened 
by the event. I had definitely planned to 
continue to stay there and work with the 
. . 
youth and members of the community." 

Since opening its doors in Janyary 
2006, the DYCLC has welcomed hun-
dreds of regular members for basketball 
tournaments, after-school programs, and 
classes that range from tax preparation to 
the well-loved line dancing. But iliis se-
mester, ONHSA, fearing that the Center's 
organization had grown too lax, suddenly 
Yale-run community center 
. 
trims its grassroots. 
opted to replace many members of its 
student and volunteer staff with certified 
teachers and educational professionals. 
The resulting controversy has sparked a 
debate about the optimal method of orga-
nizing and running mentoring programs 
in New Haven. Did the free-form, essen-
tially student-run framework employed in-
the Center's original incarnation provide 
enough oversight and structure to improve 
the lives of the city's most under-served 
children? And, on the other hand, does 
the Center's new commitment to profes-
sionalism marginalize the role ofYale stu-
dents, so integral to the Center's goal of 
bridging the gap between the University 
and the city? 
c1ts not just a job for us. Â»

TEN YEARS AGO, the Ashmun Street prop-
erty that now houses the DYCLC and the 
Yale Police Department was a "vacant, 
blighted industrial structure," says Mi-
chael Morand '87 DN '93, associate vice 
president for New Haven and State Af-

fairs. After Yale learned that a hazardous 
waste removal company wanted to buy the 
property "to park industrial equipment," 
the University decided to nab it in the 
hopes of adding "security to the neighbor-
hood." The YPD moved in, followed, in 
January 2006, by the Dixwell-Yale Com-
munity Learning Center. 

As the Center's first coordinator, El-
lis, a New Haven native newly graduated 
-
from Yale, was at first "the only full-time 
person there," she remembers. "It was a 
huge responsibility, especially for some-
one coming straight out of college, but 
I was enthusiastic about it." Even before 
the Center opened, Ellis energetically set 
about creating policies and infrastruc-
ture_by conducting "a lot of door-to-door 
work, handing out surveys, trying to 
see what sorts of programs the Dixwell 
neighborhood would be interested in." 
The community wanted youth programs, 
so the Center opened with. after-school 
and student programs Tuesdays through 
Saturdays, special programs on Sundays 
and Mondays, and a plan for continued 
expansion. Ellis continued to canvas the 
neighborhood and by the end of June had
