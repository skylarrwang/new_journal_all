lege. However, statistics from the 2007 
NABUCO endowment study show that 
only a little. over half of a school's endow-
ment, on average, is restricted and that of 
those restricted funds, 30 percent are set 
aside for financial aid. "Unless Yale could 
prove to you that they have a higher pro-
portion of the endowment that is restrict-
ed than most institutions of their type, I 
simply wouldn't let them get away with 
that argument," says Munson. 

Yale, she insists, could be more generous 
with its funds even under existing restric-
tions. But Harvard, Princeton, and Yale, 
the Holy Trinity of endowments whose 
piles of treasure stretch closer and closer to 
the heavens, are not the only schools that 
have, in Munson's estimation, reached the 
other side of that intangible line. Nam-
ing names, she points out that not only 
private but also many public schools-
the University of Texas, the University of 
Minnesota 
are guilty of big endowments 
and little spending. Colleges and universi-
ties are nonprofits, but their endowments 
dwarf those of their not-for-profit peers. 
In fact, at least 26 American academic in-
stitutions have endowments larger than 
that of the nation's wealthiest museum, 
the Metropolitan Museum of Art, whose 
endowment sits at $2 billion. 

Professor Douglas Rae, who served in 
New Haven's mayoral office in the early 
'90s and who now teaches courses on capi-
talism and the city, believes that Yale has 
done its duty to its students, its scholars, 
and its city. In his estimation, the Univer- -
sity has already paid the societal dues that 
Munson and friends demand the non-
profit begin to pay. Rae points to the tax 
revenues that Yale, as the largest owner of 
commercial property in New Haven, pays 
to the city, to the financial aid reforms of 
last year, to the institution as an engine 
of employment. "Yale is hands down the 
most beneficial institution in the city," he 
says. 

Restrictions range from well-
known professorships such as 
. . 
the Sterling to the endow-
ment for tulips at jonathan 
Edwards, Yale's wealthiest col-
lege. 

Munson claims that she won't be able 
to assess whether Yale's financial aid re-
November 2008 
forms and contributions to New· Haven 
make up for its tight-fisted endowment ·· 
policies until there is more transparency 
in the financial decisions of institutions of 
higher learning. Currently, schools are not 
obligated to disclose how they spend their 
budgets. "I believe it has really contributed 
to hoarding," says Munson.· Money man-
agement is made further opaque by the 
fact that, at Yale, the Investments Office 
is not obligated to make their investments 
public unless Yale accounts for more than 
50 percent of a company's stockholding. 

Approaching the push for transparency 
from a different side, an undergraduate 
organization called the Yale Responsible 
Endowment Project has created a petition 
to encourage the University to reconsider 
its investments in a hotel management 
company whose labor policies are less than 
praiseworthy. The group is not officially 
recognized by the University. 

Of course, there are other reasons for 
keeping Yale's books under wrap. Because 
the University is a role model in the field 
of investments, other institutions clamor 
for the details of its portfolio so that they 
might mirror it. "If Yale were to disclose 
its investments, we could potentially be 
driven out of our own investments because 
people look up to us," said the former YIO 
• Intern. 

This kind of he-said, she-said debate 
seems to have come to a draw. In the past 
year, many colleges and universities 
Yale 
included 
have drastically revamped and 
greatly improved financial aid packages for 
middle-income families. In concession, 
the other side of the debate has shifted its 
proposed legislation to the backburner. 
After a congressional hearing with univer-
sity administrators on October 8, Senator 
Grassley concluded that he would most 
likely not pursue the 5 percent spending 
rule. 

Grassley's decision was no doubt also 
influenced by the results of September's 
economic downturn. The uncertain future 
against which university administrators 
insist that enormous endowments pro-
tect may have arrived. Fellow Ivies Brown 
and Cornell have instituted hiring freezes 
because of budget concerns. But with a 
minimum 5 percent payout like the one 
Congress proposed, Yale's own endow-
ment 
which garnered only 4.5 percent 
in returns in the declining market 
would 
have shrunk. 

While college administrators point to 
decreased returns as evidence that these 
• 
institutions need to protect themselves 
against an unpredictable future, endow-
ment critics insist that these are precisely 
the conditions that call for universities to 
be generous. "Harvard uses the phrase 'a 
rainy day fund,' but it would have to be 
a rainy day of Biblical proportions," says 
Munson. "There is simply no excuse what-
soever to be sitting on those funds in a 
time like this." 

c'Jf a university could dip into 
its endowment and reward all 
the needy students that need-
ed to be rewarded, eventually 
the endowment would cease 
. ,, 
to exzst. 
-KenRedd 

With both sides claiming the recession 
as proof of their victory, the endowment 
debate has sharpened rather than settled. 
Financial aid, which was always a large 
part of the discussion, is now its core. 
"Students and their families need help,'' 
says Munson. 

Still, though some have suggested that 
schools such as Yale could offer a free ride 
to every member of each incoming class 
merely by spending its endowment returns, 
very few people actually argue that schools 
should pursue such a policy. "If a univer-
sity could dip into its endowment andre-
ward all the needy students that needed to 
be rewarded, eventually the endowment 
would cease to exist," says Redd. 

Translating Lehman's terms to layman's 
terms is not a priority 
at least not for the 
YIO. Perhaps critics of endowment spend-
ing believe that the machinery of college 
and university finances have something to 
hide because financial and administrative 
officials often behave as though there is. 
With this in mind, the use of the word 
"treasure" to describe massive university 
endowments is less hyperbolic than it 
might seem. The money's whereabouts;-
its uses and its potential abuses 
are dis-
concertingly buried.
