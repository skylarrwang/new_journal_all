Outdoor enthusiasts struggle for Yale support. 

Ragged Mountain stands in a dramatic 
ridgeline that arcs across Connecticut. 
It offers a long, challenging hiking trail, 
some of the most extensive rock climb-
ing in the state, and a view of the vibrant 
foliage, shimmering lakes, and church 
steeples of rural New England. It seems a 
world away from New · Haven, yet Yalies 
can reach the ridgeline in forty minutes-
if they have a car. This fall, after a failed 
scramble for transportation, the under-
graduate group Yale Outdoors was forced 
to cancel plans for a day hike to Ragged 
Mountain, disappointing the thirteen stu-
dents who had signed up for the trip. Of 
all the forest, trail, and river systems in the 
New Haven area, only East and West Rock 
are accessible by foot, bike, or public bus. 

For undergraduate outdoor organizations, 
most notably Yale Outdoors and the Yale 
Climbing Club, no car means no hike. 

Tired of such let-downs, Eli Bildner DC 
'10, Spencer Gray TC '09, and Bo White 
FES '09 are mobilizing outdoor groups 
and pushing for change. Since outdoor ac-tivities require more funds than the average 
undergrad group, keeping them "separate 
from the central workings of the college is 
not particularly well suited to producing 
good outdoor life," Bildner explains. He, 
Gray, and White 
representing, respec-
tively, Yale Outdoors, the Climbing Club, 
and the Forestry School's . 1 OOo/o Club-
hope to persuade the University to sup-
port the centralization of outdoor life at 
Yale. "Our vision is to have outdoor life 
as a separate program, run out of the Yale 
College Dean's office, with an endowment 
and funding," Bildner explains, outlining 
the ambitious plan with his characteristic 
calm. An umbrella group incorporating 
his, Gray's, and White's clubs as well as the 
popular Freshman Outdoor Orientation 
Trips (FOOT), would facilitate commu-
nication between organizations, increase 
their scope, and allow for a greater empha-
sis on teaching wilderness skills. Ideally, 
the umbrella group would have its own 
space 
perhaps even its own building 
in 
which groups could meet and store their 
gear. This new organization, the three be-
lieve, would reduce trip costs, solve trans-
portation issues, and unify the outdoors 
community on a university-wide level. 


LAcK OF TRANSPORTATION may seem like 
a minor issue, but it presents a formidable 
challenge to Yale's struggling outdoor 
scene. Transportation costs drain the 
fiscal resources of every outdoor-oriented 
organization at Yale. As the University"--
with the exception of community-service-
oriented Dwight Hall 
lacks a fleet of 
vans for student groups to borrow, Yalies 
are often confronted with a dilemma: 
shoulder the costs of renting a van or 
cancel a trip. 

Yalies are often confronted 
with a dilemma: shoulder the 
costs of renting a van -or can-
cel a trip. 

And transportation is only part of the 
problem. Administrators have failed to 
provide storage space, so FOOT is forced 
to stash its gear in the For~stry School's 
basement and Yale Outdoors in the Berke-
ley College music room. Unlike many 
other comparable schools, Yale has no um-
brella organization devoted to supporting 
outdoor activities. To outdoors-minded 
students like White, "it's so obvious that 
THE NEW JOURNAL 

Yale lacks a strong outdoor program." In 
cold, blustery Hanover, Dartmouth boasts 
a centralized, university-supported out-
door education program that has achieved 
national prominence. In urban Boston, 
MIT facilitates outdoor. life through an 
independent non-profit organization that 
offers organized expeditions, educational 
programs, rental vans, and equipment. 
Even universities with less of an outdoor 
focus, like Princeton and Penn, manage 
outdoor life through dedicated offices and 
provide students with space to meet and 
store gear, . while at Yale, transportation 
difficulties are symptomatic of a broad 
lack of institutional support. Like other 
student organizations, outdoors groups 
receive just several hundred dollars of Un-
dergraduate Organizing Funding Commi-
tee funding per year, far too little to fund 
far-away camping trips. 

Many students find this situation par-
ticularly frustrating given the rich natural 
environment just beyond New Haven. 
Yale owns 11,000 acres of New England 
forest which it uses primarily for re-
search purposes, as well as a 1 ,500-acre 
recreational property called the Outdoor 
Education Center, less than an hour away 
and replete with cabins, kayaks, and a 
lifeguard-staffed swimming area. Most 
undergraduates know little about these 
resources since they are not made readily 
available for student use. Yet Yale College 
students have demonstrated their interest 
in outdoor life: Almost one in three Yalies 
chooses to participate in FOOT, one in six 
applies to be a FOOT leader, and there 
are seven hundred names on the Yale Out-
doors Club's panlist. 

"Outdoor activities certainly, without 
question, attract a considerable number 
of our undergraduates," says Edgar Le-
triz, acting dean of Yale College and as-
sistant dean of student affairs. But given 
the outdoor-friendly reputation of schools 
like Dartmouth and MIT, he suspects that 
prospective students who are serious about 
outdoor life might eschew New Haven. 
"The students who want those kind of ex-
periences enroll in [other] institutions," he 
says. But luring this demographic to Yale 
is not at the top of his priority list, and 
he imagines bureaucratic difficulties with 
BUdner's plan. "They are organizations 
involved in physical activities, so it would 
be a proposal best suited to the Athletics 
department," he begins, then rethinks his 
statement. "Although at Yale, athletics is 
really more about teams. It's an odd situ-
ation. They are not the typical social or 
political organizations, they're not teams, 
so where do they fit into the scheme of 
things?" 

Further complicating the situation, Le-
triz explains, since outdoors activities span 
both undergraduate and graduate organi-
zations, "a University effort would have to 
be addressed through every dean of those 
schools." This could take years. 

Dean Letriz suspects that pro-
spective students who are seri-
ous about outdoor life might 
eschew New Haven. ''The stu-
dents who want those kind of 
experiences enroll in [other] 
institutions, "he says. 

FOOT REMAINS an outrageously popular 
program, yet its institutional base is sur-
prisingly flimsy. Unlike Cultural Connec-
tions and the FreshPerson Conference, it 
isn't fully integrated with the Yale College 
dean's office. Other than covering trip 
insurance and helping with budget ac-
counting, the office does little to smooth 
FOOT's path. The program supports 
most of its costs by charging participat-
ing freshmen and manages its lqgistics 
through a corps of student organizers. 
It also relies heavily upon its part-time 
director, Priscilla "Cilia'' Kellert '7 4 FES 
- '81. 

"Cilia is the god of FOOT!" exclaims 
Avani Dholakia TC '09, a former FO·OT 
coordinator. "She holds the glue ofFOO! 
together between leadership, and she's the 
collective memory of the organization." 

Involved since the program's inception, 
Kellert acts as FOOT's alumni database, 
general manager, and collective mother. 
FOOT even owes its storage space at the 
Forestry School to Kellert's husband, a 
Forestry School professor. 

While the umbrella organization that 
Bildner and White envision would ease 
FOOT's dependence upon one individual 
and make It less expensive for its freshmen 
participants, FOOT may prefer to main-
tain its independence. And, according to 
Letriz, the support of a broad-based group 
like FOOT might be just what Bildner 
and White need to get their umbrella 
organization off the ground. In order for 
the University to establish a campus-wide 
Yale Outing Club, he warns, the proposed 
organization would have to be backed by 
a majority of the student body. Outdoors 
groups, he said, must ask ·themselves: "If 
you build it, will they come?'' 


IF THE HISTORy of Yale's Mountaineering 
Group is any guide, says White, then the 
answer is yes. White and Gray have em-
barked on a mission to revive the now-
defunct Mountaineering Club, which they 
hope to endow with an almost academic 
philosophy. ''At one point," White says, 
the club "was the premier mountaineering 
organization in the US." Though the club's 
reputation faded during the 1960s and 
'70s, he explains, the Yale library retains 
its unusually large collection of moun-
taineering literature. In the YMC's glory 
days, mountaineering was an upper-crust 
sport, dominated by men with a surplus 
of money and time; these days, the sport 
is propelled by commercial and star pow-
er, its high-profile participants aiming to 
conquer the highest terrain in the shortest 
period of time. 

The reincarnated Yale Mountaineer-
ing Club, White hopes, would embody 
both the physical and intellectual sides of 
mountaineering. '~The school might think 
it's not academic, but it's not just a sport'--
lifestyle and intellect are involved," he ex-
plains. "Precision, risk assessment, cultural 
sensitivity, conservation, thinking about 
our relationship to the environment, wil-
derness philosophy .. .it can be very intel-
lectual." On expeditions, White insists, 
"we should look at social issues, cultural 
components, and bring back to Yale what 
we've learned." 

This experiential learning is startlingly 
deficient at a university so focused on en-
vironmental sustainability. Armed with 
its high-profile Sustainable Food Project 
and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduc-
tion Commitment, the University has 
hosted state-wide conferences on sustain-
ability and recently sent President Levin 
to Washington to testify before the Senate 
Environment and Public Works Commit-
tee. Yet somehow, amidst all this green, it 
can't seem to muster the resources to send 
a dozen students out on a day hike.
