EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
On September 26, 2007, a headshot of 
Yale's chief investment officer and · global 
investment god David Swensen graced 
the New York Times business section, ac-
companying an article about the Yale en-
dowment's 28 percent jump to an unprec-
edented $22 billion. On that same day, 
Washington legislators were also think-
ing about Yale's endowment. In a morn-
ing hearing championed by the Senate 
Finance Committee's Ranking Member, 
Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), a debate about 
college endowments was circling around 
one question: Colleges are earning a lot, 
but are they spending too little of it on fi-
nancial aid for their students? 


The coincidence was not lost on Lynn 
Munson, a critic of college and university 
spending and the hearing's star witness. 
"Despite the fact that that very week the 
Senate Finance Committee, which sets the 
tax policy for the nation, had signaled· a 
strong interest in college university endow-
ments," Munson says, "Yale went ahead 
and came out with particularly prideful 
announcements of its returns. They called 
attention to themselves even as the Fi-
nance Committee was calling these issues 
. 
'' 
mto question. 


There is certainly evidence that Yale is 
proud to be well-endowed. Snoop around 
the Investments Office and you might find 
a plush, stuffed bulldog wearing an already 
outdated Yale blue sweater that reads 
"YALE ENDOWMENT $13 BILLION" 
in stitched white lettering. More recent · 
investment office paraphernalia includes a 
tote bag lined with fabric that states "The 
Yale Endowment $23 Billion October 
2007'' written over and over again in the 
Yale font. 


The bag's lining is loud; the office that 
custom-ordered it isn't. For all of its boast-
ful openness about the market value of 
Yale's endowment, the Investments Office 
is remarkably dose-lipped when it comes 
to disclosing information about its finan-
cial practices. "The Investments Office has 
no comment to offer concerning this sub-
ject," the financial analyst contacted for 
this article emailed. During the full year 
that Jhomas Kaplan, the current editor-
in-chief of the Yale Daily News, covered the 
Investments Office for the paper, Swensen 
did not once respond to Kaplan's requests 
for an interview. Swensen recently visited 
an undergraduate class to speak about 
the endowment in a downward-turning 
economy, but he began by asking that the 
students not talk to their peers about the 
November 2008 
discussion. 


The reticence of the YIO-and of simi-
lar offices at other colleges and 'universi-
ties 
is particularly problematic given 
. their primary argument in the endowment 
spending debate: Endowments are com-
plex and critics are uninformed. Armored 
in expertise, the offices retreat. into a tight-
lipped justification for their tight-pursed 
practices: "Trust us." 


c1 would tuck that informa-
tion away in my head and 
read about the GDP of small 
nations in the morning paper 
and realize that's about the 
size of some school/ endow-
ments. 


-Lynn Munson 


MuNSON, ON THE other hand, is so loqua-
cious that the endowment critic's critics 
accuse her of being a talking head. She first 
became interested in what she calls the 
"endowment hoarding" of some colleges 
and universities while she was serving as 
chief of staff at the National Endowment 
for the Humanities, a federal grant-mak-
ing agency. Reviewing applications for 
fun4ing from . colleges and universities 
across America, Munson was stunned by 
the s_ize of many endowments. "I would 
tuck that · information away in ~y head 
and read about the GDP of small nations 
in the morning paper and realize that's 
about the size of some schools' endow-
, h 
ments, s e says. 


When Munson left her post at NEH to 
start a family, she began to more seriously 
research the endowments at US colleges 
and universities 
schools to which, she 
realized, she might soon be paying tuition. 
Since then she has become something of 
an unofficial expert on the subject and is 
currently an adjunct fellow at the Center 
for College Affordability and Productiv-
• 
lty. 


Bt,J.t Munson is by no means alone in 
her critique. Though she was one of the 
first voices to question the size of college 
and univershy endowments, others 
from 
college alumni to current students, from 
college students' parents to the parents of 
fut;ure college students 
have joined her in 
a debate that has been gaining momentum 
over the past two years. This year, Senator 
Grassley teamed up with Congressman Pe-
ter Wekh (D-Vermont) to draft a proposal

A Science Investment For Yale University 
David Swensen calls his running of the Yale endowment a labor of love. During his tenure, it has 
achieved an annual compound growth rate of 16.3 percent. 
Yale University is investing $500 
miJJion in neN science and engineering 
fadlities, induding five neN buildings 
and renovations a old ones. 
Yale's 
to try to bew111e 
more a a Sdeoce and tee t lllOiogy 
the growing 
importance that universities are pladng 
and for its 
schools. 
Universities have been spending 
heavily on fadlities to fi JSter rutting-
edge 
scientific 
but 


for legislation mandating that colleges and 
universities spend a minimum of 5 percent 
of their endowments annually, a figure al-
ready legally required of all non-academic 
non-profits. 


Administrators and Swensephiles for 
the most part dismiss these criticisms as 
ill-informed or simplistic. They empha-
size that institutions of higher education 
already have their own complex, self-im-
posed spending rules 
mathematical for-
mulas that designate what percentage ofits 
endowment a college or university spends 
during a given year. While these models 
differ slightly from school to school, all 
are designed to smooth consumption over 
time so that the university doesn't have a 
drastically irregular budget 
say, a budget 
that osciliates as much as the rate of return 
does 
from year to year. Yale's long-term 
average for endowment spending is 5.25 
percent. But that does not mean that each 
and every year Yale meets the 5 percent 
minimum that members of Congress have 
proposed. Though in years with low re-
turns Yale is likely to spend as much as 5.5 
percent of its endowment, when blessed 
with high returns, it may spend as little as 
4.5 percent. (While half of a percentage 
36 
point may sound negligible, when talking 
about an endowment in the tens of bil-
lions of dollars, even fractions of fractions 
are values worth debating.) Many consid-
erations go into the equation, but one of 
the most important factors is the spending 
rule's ability to self-adjust based on the en-
dowment's past performance in the mar-
ket. "The spending rule is based on sound 
economic analysis. It's mathematical and 
it makes sense," says a current Yale student 
and former YIO intern who wished tore-
rna m anonymous. 


The spending rule requires such delicate 
engineering because it is designed to sus-
tain a college's purchasing power to perpe-
tuity. Since Yale expects to be around in-
definitely, the equation must manage the 
present not only with an informed sense 
of the past but also with a keen eye to the 
future .. The phrase that financial officers 
at universities use to describe this parity 
between present and future is "intergen-
erational equity." A stable endowment en-
sures that scholars in the year 3008 will 
have no fewer opportunities than do their 
2008 counterparts. 


"In general, endowments are biased 
toward future students," says Ken Redd, 
director of research and policy analysis 
for the National Association of College 
and University Business Officers, which 
conducts an annual and highly respected 
study of higher-education endowments in 
which Yale takes part. Redd's tone provides 
no hint of value judgment, either positive 
or negative, on whether such a bias is de-
sirable. "That's a subjective question," he 
says blandly. 


A stable endowment ensures 
that scholars in the year 3008 
will have no fewer opportuni-
ties than do their 2008 coun-
terparts. 


Critics, however, do not avoid the 
subjective, and their opinions are pretty 
transparent. "Where is the line between 
saving up for students of the future and 
asking today's students to make sacrifices 
that are too great and actually kind of de-
prive them?" asks Munson, who believes 
that many institutions of higher education 
in the U.S. have already crossed this line. 
"The policy seems to be more for the sake 
of more," she says, describing a keeping-
up-with-the-Joneses mentality . 


But in addition to the need to stabilize 
spending between the present and the fu-
ture, administrators claim that, even if a 
university wanted to spend much higher 
percentages of its endowment, there are 
a number of factors that limit how much 
the university could spend. Though the 
YIO tote bags boast "$23 billion" in a 
repeating pattern, this number is not the 
whole story. "That's the market value, but 
it's not actually the amount of cash they 
have," explains Redd. On average, about 
a quarter of college and university en-
dowments are invested in illiquid assets 
such as hedge funds, private equities, and 
natural resources, which cannot be sold in 
the open market. Illiquid assets not only 
diversify a university's investment portfo-
lio, they also "prevent raiding the endow-
ment," says Redd. 


Much of the endowment is inaccessible 
for another reason: earmarks. When do-
nors give money to colleges and universi-
ties, they have the option of mandating it 
for a specific purpose. Restrictions range 
from well-known professorships such as 
the Sterling to the endowment for tulips 
at Jonathan Edwards, Yale's wealthiest col-
