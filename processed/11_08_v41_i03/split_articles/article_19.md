On a golden day in October in New Ha-
ven, Connecticut, in a tall, old red-brick 
building on Yale's immaculate campus, 
natural. gas combusts at 1 ,200 degrees. 
"Maybe hotter," says Tom Starr, the 
manager of Yale's Central Power Plant. 
Starr leads me up a few metal steps and 
opens a hand-sized hatch on the side of a 
huge, green, insulated-steel box to reveal 
a little window. Inside, the space explodes 
with outlandish purple and yellow flames. 
We're looking at the burner that pro-
vides fuel to the big green box, called a 
boiler. Natural gas burns .to make heat in 
the burner. The heat turns water into steam 
in the boiler. And steam is everything. 
Steam runs all over campus to meet space 
heating and hot water needs. It powers the 
turbines that run steam-driven chillers to 
make chilled water for air conditioning. It 
drives the pumps that push chilled water 
in huge blue pipes from the power plant to 
every corner of campus. It keeps us warm, 
it keeps us cool, it keeps our showers hot 
and our dishes clean and our dining halls 
open, and it protects priceless research by 
maintaining the precise climate conditions 
required in labs on Science Hill. 
Starr explains all of this as we· walk 
through the plant. He speaks with the 
conversational manner of a practiced tour 
guide, casually slipping in technical terms 
just a beat too fast for me, but with the . 
volume of a bullhorn, competing with the 
noise of the plant. It· is a hissing, buzz-
ing, roaring, put-on-your-hard-hat kind 
of noise, slightly different in each part of 
this maze of metal and concrete. My own 
hard hat keeps slipping down my forehead 
and clanking against my safety goggles. 
It's pitiful enough that Starr interrupts his 
well-honed speech to help me adjust the 
hard hat. My eyes and ears must be at their . 
best to take in what so much of the Yale 
community remains blind to. 


"In the commercial side it's 
entirely 
about production_ 
costs. And for the Yale com-
munity it's reliability rst and 
production costs second. , . 
-Tom Starr 

After a few years of working on the 
advocacy side of Yale's commitment to 
sustainability by trying, mostly in vain, 
to pound conservation into student be-
havior 
most recently as the head of the 
energy team in the Yale Student Taskforce 
for Environmental Partnership (STEP) 
I 
have come in search of the commitment 
on the ground. What is it, exactly, that 
we pollution-haters are trying to replace? 
Images of the University's bright future 
hide what could be the strongest potential 
motivation for Yalies to conserve. As Yale 
President Richard Levin hands out glossy 
brochures of greenhouse gas goals to all 
of his official visitors, and as engineering-
ignorant environmentalists like me push 
Yale and its students to achieve these goals, 
the reality stands here: in the 1200° fossil-
fuel flames that continue to power our 
lifestyle. 

IN 200 5, LEVIN announced his much-
touted Greenhouse Gas Reduction Com-
mitment, vowing to reduce Yale's green-
house gas emissions to 10 percent below 
1990 levels (or 43 percent below 2005 
levels) by 2020. Since Levin's announce-
ment, the University has showered anti-
emissions efforts with publicity and funds. 
But the goal has come head-to-head with 
an even more pressing ambition: Yale is ex-
pandening at an unprecedented pace, adding 
more and more energy-intensive square 
footage to its campus. The commitment 
to greenhouse gas reduction is swimming 
upstream, and the current is only growing 
stronger. 

Yet emissions reduction is hidden where 
we might least expect it. Despite the de-
monization of conventional energy pro-
duction, Starr and company quietly wage 
their own battle to cut our carbon. Next 
to the big green box ·stands an even big-
ger gray box: another boiler, but this one 
is different. This cogeneration system, also 
known as combined heat and power, pro-
duces both electricity and steam from the 
same input of fuel 
and, in doing so, cuts 
greenhouse gas emissions drastically. One 
of Central Power Plant's three "cogen" 
units is shut down today for maintenance, 
Starr tells me excitedly, so I will be one of 
the few tourists to see inside a process that 
usually remains invisible. He opens a door 
to reveal the cool interior of the dormant 
cogen and points out a turbine, roughly 
the diameter of a bike wheel. Instead of 
directly powering a boiler, the burning of 
natural gas runs this gas turbine, which 
spins a generator to produce electricity. 
Meanwhile, the gas that powered the tur-
bine still holds energy in the form of heat; 
the gas exhaust is about one thousand de-
grees. Here, the cogen kicks in: The hot 
exhaust is channeled into a boiler to make 
steam. 

At the end of the day, run-
a blue plastic brush 
nzng 
down 15, 000 twenty-foot-
long tubes is, in terms of emis-_ 
sions reduction, one of the best 
things we can do. 

The cogen boiler is no different from 
the conventional boiler in the green box:-
except that it's getting its heat from anoth-
er source. "So the fuel that we burn here, 
we kinda get to use it twice," Starr says. By 
the time the twice-used gas exits the boiler 
and heads up and out of the tall smoke-
stacks, it has lost about 700°, leaving it at a 
modest 300. "We're taking a huge amount 
of thermal energy out of that exhaust gas 
and making something useful out of it," 
Starr boasts. 

Cogen cuts down on both cos_ts and 
emissions. Aside from its double use of 
fuel, the system allows Yale to produce 
much of its own electricity rather than rely 
entirely on the regional electric grid. Each 
of Central Power Plant's three cogenera-
tion units produces about six megawatts 
of electricity. Combined, that's enough to 
power 300,000 standard light bulbs 
or 
to cover about half of the electricity de-
mand in Central's coverage area, which in-
dudes all of Central Campus and Science 
Hill. The remaining half still comes from 
the utility company. By burning relatively 
dean natural gas {with ultra-low-sulfur 
diesel oil for backup), Yale significantly 
improves the environmental profile of its 
grid, which relies in part on highly pol-
luting coal-burning plants. And although 
building a cogeneration facility requires a 
huge investment 
$100 million for the 
Central cogen project 
the system pays 
for itself in less than a decade. 

Cogeneration is one of the cleanest ways 
to burn fossil fuel for power, but in the 
end, it is still burning fossil fuel. Yale these 
does not allow Starr and his colleagues to 
prioritize efficiency and emissions reduc-
tion; trying more experimental dean en-
ergy options takes place outside the plants, 
in settings that hold no risk of upsetting 
Yale's power supply. Yale demands reliabil-
ity, to a much higher standard than that of 
a typical utility. 

Coming from the commercial utility 
business, Starr found Yale "very, very dif-
ferent. In the commercial side it's entirely 
about production costs," he says. "And 
for the Yale community it's reliability first 
and production costs second." The Yale 
plants not only provide comfort but also 
run kitchens, medical facilities, and sci-
ence labs that must maintain standards 
of temperature, humidity, .and ventilation 
both to meet safety regulations and to sus-
tain careers' worth of experiments. Starr 
and his colleagues cringe at the mention 
of "That Day Last January," when a con-
struction accident caused parts of campus 
to lose power. "For an operation like this, 
the total integrated cost isn't just the cost 
of operating and, you know, did you burn 
m·ore or less fuel than you could have," 
Starr says. "The total cost is what hap-
pens if this facility stops operating? What's 
the value of the research work that's lost? 
What's the value of incurring damage to 
buildings? We provide the · only source of 
heat to the Central Campus. So what hap-
pens to the buildings if we're not able to 
provide heat in the dead of winter? There 
is an economic cost to that and it's enor-
mous. It's huge!" 

The big-picture measure of reliability is 
what is called firm capacity; that is, what 
would a plant be able to produce if its 
biggest unit shut down? For steam firm 
capacity, for instance, if Central's biggest 
boiler broke, how much steam would we 
able to produce? And for electricity, how 
much could we produce using cogenera-
tion alone if the grid went out, or, in re-
verse, how much could we take from the 
grid if our cogen shut down? A depend-
able power plant has built-in redundancy, 
with many machines running only to back 
up others. Redundancy not only insures 
against machine failure; it also allows 
workers to regularly shut down one set of 
machines for maintenance while another 
set fills in. 

Yale's cogeneration is not only an envi-
ronmental measure but part of what Starr 
calls the University's "very, very deep in-
vestments in assuring reliability." Yale's co-
gen electricity is cleaner and cheaper than 
the grid, but it is also more reliable. For 
Yale's medical community, with its high 
concentration of research labs and medical 
facilities, the stability of cogenerated elec-
tricity has ' proved a crucial selling point. 
After witnessing a decade of successful 
cogen operation at Central Power Plant, 
its medical campus counterpart, Sterling 
Power Plant, is preparing to install its own, 
IS-megawatt cogen facility. 

Muir learned a valuable les-
son: When the Yale communi-
ty demands energ)'> you make 
it happen 
but it better not 
get zn anyones way. 

Aside from the occasional $1 00-mil-
lion-dollar addition, the day-to-day work 
of assuring reliability consists of checking, 
cleaning, and replacing countless nuts, 
bolts, lights, pipes, and blades. Most of the 
work of running a power plant, Starr says, 
is constant routine maintenance. 

As we talk in Starr's office, which sits 
above the operations at Central Power 
Plant, two men in soot-smeared overalls 
saunter in; they have just cleaned a boiler. 
Starr looks them over. "It's not as clean as 
it should have been based on the looks of 
you, 
"h 
e says. 

One answers, chest thrust out, "It's a 
lot cleaner now, chie£" They launch into 
a discussion about baffie plates and crack 
stoppers. Once Starr is finished interro-
gating the men, he lapses into a thought-
ful pause, .then slips in one last question. 
"Drums looked all right?" "Yeah," one 
man answers, adding slyly, "Other than 
being too small." The other jumps in: 
"Can't imagine 
those holes just keep get-
ting smaller." They all laugh. 

The drums, Starr explains, are the 
round hatches that lead into a boiler. "For 
licensing for the boilers," Starr explains, 
"we're required to do an inspection every 
year. That inspection is very, very invasive. 
Those two guys have just crawled through 
the boiler from one end to the other on 
what's called a fireside, which is where the
