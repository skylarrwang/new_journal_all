CROSS ROADS 
I first encountered Holy Land USA, a 
now-defunct Christian amusement park 
in Waterbury, Connecticut, when I was 
nine years old and on vacation with my 
evangelist neighbors as part of their ongo-
ing and ill-fated project to enfold me into 
the flock. The family was nice enough, 
but something about their dynamic left 
me unnerved: The father was upstand-
ing, but with an officious and verbally 
abusive streak. The children seemed to 
believe that bees were satanic slaves. And 
the mother, congenial, pious, vaguely 
medicated, might have possessed as much 
faith in the miracle workings of Cymbalta 
as she did in anything prescribed by the 
New Testament. As we drove across the 
state to a steady stream of Worship FM, 
the illuminated crucifix standing atop the 
decrepit remains of Holy Land was visible 
&om the highway for miles in each direc-
tion and appeared to represent some kind 
of spiritual harbinger for the weekend to 
come. Would I embrace Christ? Would 
the magic finally take effect? 

"There's the cross!" exclaimed the sev-
en-year-old daughter from her car-seat. 
All eyes turned to the road as we passed 
beneath the embankment. It was a sin-
gular vision of roadside rapture. The cars 
around us fell away from view, the sound 
of the radio receded. But this transcendent 
moment could not tast. "Pay Â· attention 
to the road, dear," came the concerned 
wife's voice. Before long, we had passed 
Holy Land by and found ourselves at 
some cloistered resort, possibly also called 
Holy I .and, playing tennis and muttering 
November 2008 
prayers over macaroni and cheese. I never 
got around to embracing the Savior, but 
the image of that cross stayed with me. I 
vowed to return to Waterbury one day, but 
in different company. 

In April 2008, the crucifix had been 
torn down by the city and replaced ~ith 
a new, polished-metal replica. It was an 
unexpected decision, given the morbid 
disrepair into which the rest of Holy Land 
had been allowed to fall following its 1984 
closure. The simultaneously charming and 
psychotic brainchild of a loc~ lawyer, the 
park was originally imagined as a divine 
alternative to places like Disney World 
or Universal Studios, and in the midst of 
its 1950s heyday drew tens of thousands 
of visitors a year. A half-century later, its 
miniature recreation of Bethlehem has 
crumbled and pine trees shield the bits of 
scripture carved into stone. Guarding the 
hallowed ground is a convent of nuns who 
reside in a complex by the chain-linked 
gate and make it their business to chase 
away marauding hoboes or sexually ad-
venturous teenagers. In an alarming and 
poignant transformation, Holy Land USA 
has mutated into something more akin to 
Holy Shit USA, hallowed ground whose 
present-day allure seems less ecclesiastical 
than sublimely ironic. 

It was a rainy and miserable night this 
November when I finally embarked on 
my long-awaited return to holy ground. 
In place of Christ-crazy chaperones, I was 
accompanied by my alcoholic roommates. 
Instead.of DC Talk, we listened to NWA. 
As we cruised through toilet-bowl weather 
to a Death Row soundtrack, I knew that 
a new era had arrived. I have difficulty~ 
believing in a higher power, but at the 
time, something about driving a Japanese 
vehicle through collapsing New England 
strip-malls as "Straight out of Compton" 
destroyed the speakers felt like an undeni-
ably spiritual, if not necessarily liturgical, 
phenomenon. After 45 minutes~ the glow-
ing cross dawned over the damp cesspool 
of Waterbury like an ostentatious street-
lamp. I was overjoyed. "I hope we don't 
get murdered," my roommate muttered. 

Holy Land, while technically private 
property, is not difficult to infiltrate. Af-
ter parking our car down the hill from the 
convent so as to avert whatever kind of po-
lice attention exists near large populations 
of nuns, we walked around the border 
fence and entered the complex through 
an open gate. In the darkness, we pulled 
aside branches to reveal decimated altars 
and busted porcelain figurines. Micro-
Bethlehem, up close, shrouded in fog, had 
devolved into a violent parody of religious 
tourism. This was not faded glory but 
total annihilation. The flocks of families 
the site once hosted had left no trace of 
their presence; the sole indication of hu-
man contact was lazy and unimaginative 
vandalism, an anarchy sign spray-painted 
over a shattered Virgin. We moved uphill, 
pushing past trees, until the forest opened 
up and the crucifix stood before us. Stand-
ing on the cinder base beneath its soar-
ing, electrified scaffolding, the three of us 
looked do~n ,on Waterbury, the windows 
of its innumerable department stores and 
gas stations and hospitals glowing in the 
fog like fireflies in a swamp. It was all very 
moving and beautiful, as if the lights of the 
amusement park had somehow migrated 
down the hill from Holy Land to set up a 
more permanent and depressing camp in 
the valley, some sort of strange and fallen 
Palestine. 

When Walt Disney gave evangelist 
preacher Billy Graham a tour of Disney-
land, his guest is known to have remarked 
that the park was pure make-believe. Dis-
ney responded, "You know, the fantasy isn't 
here. This is very real ... the park is reality. 
The people are natural here; they're hav-
ing a good time; they're communicating. 
That's what people really are. The fantasy 
is out there 
outside the gates of Disney-
land, where people have hatreds and peo-
ple have jealousy. It's not really real." 

But Holy Land hints at a new progno-
sis. The hatreds of people are directed at 
rides and icons 
a trash-filled manger, a 
concrete Jesus anointed in graffiti 
while 
the real world, imperfect and hazy but im-
bued with a prescient and artificial magic, 
sits in a valley filled with cars'and nuns.
