ting long. But downstairs, in Trainworld, 
Steve taps into a well of superhuman fas-
tidiousness. "I was a Marine cadet for four 
years and I think it taught me some weird 
discipline thing," he says. This value lives 
on as he sits at his basement desk at three 
in the morning, with a beer and an earful 
ofNPR, counting receding windows on a 
black and white postcard with a magnify-
ing glass and a toothpick. 

A couple of times per year, collectors 
and miniaturists put down their magni-
fying glasses to mingle at their grandest 
gathering: .the model railroad convention. 
Steve shows up to a handful of these events, 
mostly to buy material or to sell his surplus 
supplies. He describes the scene as an un-
likely arena for middle-aged machismo·-
balding men in thick glasses dropping 
train jargon, pushing to the front of the 
display room with big expensive cameras 
while their wives wait on benches ringing 
the perimeter. "Every model builder is my 
dad's age. The future does not look hope-
ful," Steve says. The average train guy is 
a retired engineer, a current rail conduc-
tor, or a quarry worker. They tend to be a 
little overweight and a little overpatriotic. 
"I mean, I love the USA, but I'm not go-
ing to wear an American wolf T-shirt and 
be like, 'Heyyy,' you know what I mean?" 

Almost every miniature-builder picked up 
the hobby as an extension of a mechani-
cal vocation. "For a lot of the guys, it's 
all about, 'Hey man, look at my DL109 
New Haven. It's only made from 1949 to 
1950,"' Steve says, referring to a type of 
train. "That's all garbage, I don't like any 
of that stuff." 

Steve isn't in it for the machinery or the 
affirmation of masculinity. For him, the 
heart of this solitary activity is a connec-
tion to people, and he likes nothing better 
than to sit down and talk trains with some 
of the great old-timers. He's in touch with 
a wide network of Midwestern model-
builders and corresponds with an old her-
mit living off the grid in Washington State, 
where he grows a special plant Steve uses 
in his miniature forests. But while Steve 
named his third town Tribute as a nod to 
those who came before him, Trainworld 
honors more than model-railroaders. As 
Steve leads me from building to building, 
he shows me that the real foundation of 
each structure is made not of bass wood 
or chopsticks but of bits and pieces of his 
biography. His uncle spent years invent-
ing a lightweight bike n10del before up-
rooting his family to a cabin in the Blue 
Ridge Mountains; Fair Hope's bike repair 
shop is housed in a wooden A-frame. Steve 
spent his brief stint at a North · Carolina 
boarding school smoking cigarettes in· the 
shadow of a rusting water tower. "I always 
wanted to climb one," he says. In Tribute, 
a line of miniature boys lean over the rail-
ing of a water tower, egging on classmates 
scaling the ladder below. 

But perhaps the story best chronicled in 
the tracks and beams of Train world is the 
narrative of a region's past. "I really love 
the history of New Haven," says · Steve, 
who has lived in the Elm City all his life. 
Pasted on the ceiling is an aging, arm's.:. 
length map of New Haven rail-lines. "See 
that train yard, where the lines all connect? 
1hat's Target," he says. Hunting down in-
spiration and materials brings him out of 
the basement and onto his city's streets. 
Working from a 1908 postcard, he once 
spent an afternoon searching the water-
front at City Point for the exact site of 
19th-century oyster beds. The door of Fair 
Hope's brewery is decorated with an old 
bottle cap he found when. visiting the site 
of the New Haven original. But despite his 
interest in earlier eras, all of Steve's towns 
are frozen sometime between the dawn of 
the railroad revolution and the rise of to-
day's Target. 

Steve does not appe~ to harbor a 1950s 
fetish, however, and upon closer inspec-
tion, his layouts reveal a sense of humor in · 
his approach to picket-fence America. Pine 
Ridge sports a red light district; Greylock 
Falls hosts a chain gang. Boy scouts march 
through a thick forest that obscures a circle 
of drunks and a lady with a shotgun. But 
these details are playful, not cynical; there's 
a beauty to each of these towns, a blessed 
simplicity. This is Steve's parents' era, and 
for him, there's something romantic about 
it. "I kind of wish I was around in, like, 
post-World-War-II America," he says. "I 
feel like there was a lot of hope." 

Only toward the end of my tour of 
Trainworld does Steve remember the train. 
He unwraps a heavy locomotive and at-
taches a string of cars, each one unique. "I 
could have been a hobo, ridden the rails, 
done that whole thing,'' he says, dust-
ing the caboose with a whisk brush. And 
while Steve's no vagrant, his earlier life 
mirrored the mobility of one. Out of high 
school, he and his brother took their band, 
Mighty Purple, on the road 
or, more ap-
propriately, the rails. "I traveled ten years 
of my life solid. Out of the state of Con-
necticut two hundred plus days a year," he 
remembers. His band forwent asphalt for 
crossties, and Steve speaks with nostalgia 
of his train days, of travels up and down 
the coast, from Charlottesville to Boston, 
of being thrown together with strangers 
on fourth-class, 14-hour journeys. Train-
life 
the constant, blurred exposure to 
new landscape, days and nights spent 
swapping stories and smoking out bar car 
windows, always engaged and always tak-
ing in 
suits Steve. But as he neared thir-
ty, he felt the pull from train to town. He 
married, had a kid, and, for the first time, 
became serious about miniatures. 

But when Steve left the bar car for his 
basement, he did not stop watching the 
world and gathering its stories 
he merely 
replaced the blurry view from the window 
of a moving train with the precise inspec-
tion of a magnifying glass: In the steps of 
Fair Hope and the beams of Graylock Falls, 
the narratives ofNew England merge with 
his own story. 

"Let's show · you nighttime," Steve 
says. He hits the lights, cues the locomo-
tive, and sets his timers. At first, nothing 
pierces the darkness save the glow of a lone 
fire in the backwoods of Pine Ridge. But, 
slowly, sounds begin to emerge and over-
lap--cows moo, crickets chirp, twangy 
bluegrass floats from the bandstand. Then, 
one by one, living rooms illuminate, ·light 
floods the pool hall and the rug shop, and 
streedamps flicker and blink to life. Now 
comes the rumble, near-silence cut by a 
crescendoing thunder. The whistle sounds, 
the railroad crossing sign blinks red_, the 
safety gate lowers across the main street. In 
rushes the train 
its lights pass over Fair 
Hope, and in an instant, it is gone. Steve 
rolls up the sleeves of his blue and green 
flannel shirt and leans against the border 
of his miniature world. Five years ag9, he 
would have been on that train, but since 
then, he's realized that a moving life is not 
for him. He doesn't want to hurtle past the 
world's exquisite details.
