Well into the new century, Fair Hope, 
Connecticut appears to be suffering from 
chronic nostalgia for the 1950s. Kids 
play baseball in a vacant lot, their home 
runs dropping into a field of weeds and 
lilacs. The pool hall does good business. 
The church hosts crowd-pleaser mar-
riage ceremonies, the couples posing for 
photographs on steps of well-worn brick. 
Everyone is white; everyone looks happy. 
Except for when the train ruris through, 
the streets are pleasantly quiet. 
Like the other three towns it borders, 
Fair Hope is made up of thirty sections 
each less than thirty inches long. Its 路 resi-
dents fit on my thumbnail; few buildings -
are taller than my forefinger. Fair Hope 
is an entirely realized world, growing up 
building by building in the basement of 
New Haven's most unlikely miniaturist. 
"This postcard right here is a postea rd of 
a piano factory in Ivoryton, Connecticut," 
Steve Rodgers says, pointing to a yellowed 
print of Fair Hope's real-world inspiration, 
taped beneath its three-dimensional repli-
ca. "I built this in five days during a snow-
storm week, just sat on the couch while my 
wife watched Project Runway. Tim Gunn's 
dope, you know what I mean?" Steve, this 
miniature world's divine creator, is giving 
me a路guided tour of the four fictional towns 
connected by a working railway. He's eager 
to show, though he apologizes for taking 
my time. Not a miniaturist by trade, Steve 
has spent the working half of his 34 years 
in the music industry 
ten years touring 
with his brother, some stints with record 
labels, and a current gig as manager ofThe 
Space, an underage performance venue in 
ffamden. 
But on his off-days, his fictional world 
comes first. "I get really excited, I'll put in a 
fourteen hour day," Steve admits, pointing 
to a grocery store without any right angles. 
"I probably worked three weeks here just 
building that building from scratch." 
c7 get really excited I'll put 
in a fourteen hour day, ~~ Stev_e 
admits~ pointing to a grocery 
store without any right an-
gles. 
Steve is a scavenger. ''I'm a tag sale junk-
ie, like beyond junkie," he confesses. On 
average, he hits 15 sales a week 
garage 
sales, rummage sales, estate sales. After 
an initial learning phase, he stopped us-
ing kits, so he's constantly stockpiling his 
own materials. "Everything that I see, I'm 
always like, how can I use that in the con-
text of a miniature world?" Steve says, tak-
ing me through his diorama. The baseballs 
in the field are cupcake sprinkles; the port 
windows in the shipyard are eyelets from 
childrens' shoes; some of the buildings' 
interior bracing is done with chopsticks. 
Steve's always snatching up cast-offs and 
putting them to use. Out on a walk with 
his five-year-old daughter, he uncovered a 
huge, old railroad sign beneath a rotting 
caboose. The sign now graces the basement 
entry to what Steve calls "Trainworld." 路 
"My wife thinks I'm crazy," he laughs. 
"We'll be out in the yard and I'll start kill-
ing our bushes for the sake of making new 
forests in my miniature world." 
On the streets of Fair Hope 
as on the 
streets of New Haven 
fresh paint min-
gles with decay, but in Trainworld, Steve's 
diligence, not nature's entropy, drives dis-
order. "This is alcohol and India ink. Us 
real model-makers use this for weather-
ing," Steve explains as he pours dark liquid 
onto a strip of bass wood. Some buildings 
are peeling, and birds nest on rooftops and 
leave behind their droppings. Red brick is 
scuffed with sidewalk chalk. Days' worth 
of Steve's labor is not even visible. He re-
moves the roof of the church to show me a 
rehearsal for the Christmas pageant taking 
place inside; he stoops down to eye-level to 
peek in through the window of the billiard 
hall, where at a tiny pool table a man is 
poised to hit the eight ball. 路Had Steve not 
pointed it out, I would never have noticed 
that the siding of every four-inch building 
is lined with pinpoint nail holes. 
Steve's attention to detail has paid off, 
earning him something akin to celebrity 
status in the world of miniatures: His cre-
ation was recently photographed for Mod-
el Railroader Magazine. But beyond the 
borders of Fair Hope, Pine Ridge, Tribute, 
and Graylock Falls, Steve couldn't care less 
about exactitude. ''I'm not a meticulous 
person," he insists. "If you look upstairs 
in my dresser, you'll be like 'Woahhh .. .' 
" Nothing about him suggests precision. 
He punctuates his profoundest insights 
with colloquialisms, the backseat of his car 
could host a tag sale, and his hair is get-
