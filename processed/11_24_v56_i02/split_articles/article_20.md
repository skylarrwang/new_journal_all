T
he student secretary, lacking  a 
real desk, sits behind a folding table 
erected to one side of the foyer. 35 
Broadway, tucked behind the Shops at 
Yale, is spacious and quiet. Cleaning 
product hangs in the air. Save for the 
small plaques identifying these rooms 
as the home of Student Accessibility 
Services (SAS), the office could belong 
to anyone.

Before I entered Yale as a trans­
fer student this fall, I had never even 
seen a public conversation on disabil­
ity. “Disability” was appointments after 
school, weekend trips to big medical 
centers in San Francisco that didn’t 
make sense to my friends, and the imme­
diate, unspoken isolation that comes 
when I am given 50 percent more time to 
complete the exam that everyone studied 
hard for. 

Now, at Yale, a vast network of acces­
sibility services is just an email away. In 
2015, SAS provided accommodations for 
720 students. Nine years later, that num­
ber has more than quadrupled. With just 
seven employees on staff, SAS now ser­
vices some three thousand students across 
the entire University. Extra time on tests, 
single dorm rooms, dietary accommo­
dations, and assistive technology, among 
many other accommodations, fall to SAS 
to administer, regulate, and support. 

Yet even at Yale, where I have access 
to previously unimaginable resources, 
where students have actively organized 
around disability, and where nearly one 
in four students receive accommoda­
tions, I hesitate to say I have found a 
community. As national debates over 
the increase in accommodations con­
tinue, they focus almost entirely on 
Critical

The SAS office is located at 35 Broadway.
