Points of Departure
It was in prison, forced to make 
license plates, stop signs, and audito­
rium chairs for 75 cents per day, that he 
started to “wake up.”  
Foster realized that the racism he’d 
experienced as a Black man growing 
up in New Haven “had something to 
do with capitalism”—the way he was 
treated in prison felt like “modern-day 
slavery.” He became fascinated by the 
Black Panthers; he’d seen the Spike 
Lee film Malcolm X as a child and pic­
tured himself in the disillusioned and 
imprisoned young Malcolm.  
Upon his discharge, Foster felt that 
a lot of people in his position would 
simply “sit down, blend in, and live a 
quiet life.” But he had to do something. 
He began volunteering at neighborhood 
projects, including the Connecticut 
Community for Addiction Recovery, 
where he met Eric Goodman, a 28-year-
old from Vermont and founder of the 
RCA’s Connecticut branch. 

If you’ve come across the “Are You A 
Communist?” posters plastered around 
Yale’s campus, you’ve already had your 
first dalliance with the RCA. The group’s 
origins are far from New Haven: it was 
founded by Ted Grant, 
a Trotskyist who had 
spent the 1970s work­
ing with the insurgent 
group Militant to infil­
trate the British Labour 
Party. After being kicked 
out in 1983, Grant started 
giving up on the idea that 
you could make change 
through the party sys­
tem. The Revolutionary 
Communist International, 
the organization he estab­
lished a decade later, had 
a more radical vision.
The RCA believes that 
under 
capitalism, 
the 
average person’s quality of 
life slowly gets worse and 
worse until, at some point, 
the floodgates break and 
general strikes and mass 
class struggle ensue. Their 
job is to set up a structure 
for the impending revolu­
tion: Goodman explained 
they aim to “recruit people, 
build up leaders, and send 
them back to the neighbor­
hoods that they’re in.” 

F  
or a member of the Revolutionary 
Communists of America (RCA), Hassan 
Foster is a mild-mannered man. Sporting 
a beanie and oversized blazer, he opened 
his notebook to a page titled “Left-wing 
Activism.” The 42-year-old was soft-spo­
ken when we met for coffee, almost 
passing as just another armchair revolu­
tionary. Nothing could be further from 
the truth. 
After ten years in custody, Foster 
was released from the Connecticut 
prison system last spring. Charged with 
a violent crime, he claims he was pres­
sured by self-interested public defend­
ers into taking a plea, arbitrarily placed 
in solitary confinement for weeks, and 
beaten by guards who “looked at him as 
their slave.” 
Goodman was introduced to com­
munism as a sophomore at McGill 
University. At a performance art show, 
he was instructed to stare into a strang­
er’s eyes for five minutes; when their 
time was up, the pair began a casual 
conversation which soon grew political. 
The woman asked whether he’d want 
to go to a communist party meeting—
Goodman tentatively said yes. 
Sitting in his first RCA meeting, he 
found himself enthralled by how “these 
people were saying funny words like 
bourgeoise and prose…but they had a 
robust framework for why things were 
so fucked up.” His chemical engineering 
degree simply wasn’t part of the solution. 
Soon, transferring out of McGill, mov­
ing to Denver, and ditching engineering 
for history, he started a local branch and 
began organizing.  
 By 2020 Goodman found himself 
settling down with his partner in New 
Haven, ready to be “done with it all.” 
Then, the national party came calling. 
When a budding local communist asked 
the party how he could get involved 
with communism in New Haven, the 
RCA put him in touch with Goodman, 
impressed by the branch he’d built in 
Denver. Organizing, Goodman believes, 
“starts with two people,” and the party 
had found him a second.
Now, every Monday, members of 
the RCA get together and discuss texts—
Lenin’s “State and Revolution” was on 
last week’s agenda. During the week, 
they put theory into practice: attending 
protests, holding rallies, or making the 
case for communism to their friends and 
coworkers. For now, the driving goal of 
the RCA is to connect like-minded peo­
ple and build a network—Foster has 
taken college-aged “comrades” to meet 
his friends who are still in prison, and 
the group is meeting members of the 
New York branch this month. The RCA 
declined to tell me the number of mem­
bers they have––either out of secrecy 
for their grand revolutionary plans, or 
the fact that they might be smaller than 
Goodman lets on. 

Part of their strategy is to work 
within existing protests. During the 
pro-divestment protest on Beinecke 
Plaza last April, two RCA members 
camped out day and night among Yale 
students in an effort to translate inter­
national frustrations to issues closer 
to home, like workers’ rights. The RCA 
holds their own rallies as well, their 
posters emblazoned with “Fight Tuition 
Hikes!” or “No War With Iran!” 
As Goodman put it, “Foreign policy 
is just an offshoot of domestic policy.” 
Foster, who still isn’t quite a hard­
core revolutionary, hopes the party 
will empower him to make changes 
here at home. “I’m not exactly sure 
what it looks like but we can do bet­
ter. The country can do better,” Foster 
told me. He’s trying to “see a better 
city,” to reform the justice system, and 
to shine a light on the “Black magic” of 
the courtroom. After all, while he got 
a second chance, not everyone does. 
J’Allen Jones, a friend of his, was killed 
in Garner Correctional Institution in 
Newtown, Connecticut in 2018. Foster’s 
tone sombered each time he mentioned 
his own two years spent in Garner: “It 
was hell in there, there was more vio­
lence than I’ve ever seen.” 
Foster has found a second home 
in the RCA: “I’m a brother that’s been 
adopted into the family; they didn’t 
judge me for doing ten years in prison, 
they just invited me in. People want to 
hear what I have to say.” At the core, it’s 
a group where like-minded people from 
a panoply of backgrounds can gather 
and carve out a space for themselves. Yes, 
the RCA reads Lenin on Mondays, but 
they play Monopoly on Wednesdays 
and barbecue on the weekend.  
However, Goodman was quick to 
dispel any notions that the RCA was 
all fun and games. “This is a hardcore 
organization,” he said. People have to 
be “up to their responsibilities”—each 
comrade has a defined title in the party, 
from ‘Secretaries’ to ‘Press Officers.’
Chantal Gibson, a 21-year-old 
party member from New Haven, 
emphatically agreed.
“Being a comrade is a different type 
of bond,” said Gibson. “We’re not just 
casual friends, and we don’t play per­
sonality politics.” The ties between 
comrades are based off a fundamental 
understanding that “when the time 
comes, you’re dedicated and committed 
to the cause.”
The RCA itself probably isn’t going to 
overthrow capitalism, but every Monday 
night, a ragtag group of activists bands 
together, reads Marx, and keeps a small 
but fierce revolutionary flame alive in 
New Haven. Gibson accepts that their 
work “may seem small in New Haven,” 
but for revolutions around the country 
and the world to succeed, “we need to 
do our job.”  
As Goodman remarked, “A better 
world has to be possible—because if not, 
what’s the point?”∎
