nE SPRING AFTERNOON, Amber 
Leblanc’s fifth-grade daughter, 
Bella, came home in tears. Bella, 
who has dyslexia, had just met with her 
first special-ed teacher at her Chesire 
public elementary school. The teacher 
told her that whenever she sees her 
older sister Elisabeth, an avid book­
worm, reading, she should be reading, 
too. “To give that task to Bella is so 
overwhelming and so inconsiderate,” 
LeBlanc remarked.
It took three years of arguing with 
administrators for LeBlanc to get a for­
mal ADHD and dyslexia diagnosis for 
Bella. When LeBlanc brought up the 
problem to Bella’s teacher, she remem­
bers the teacher saying that Bella simply 
needed to “try harder.” 
After LeBlanc resorted to hiring 
an external tutor, the school claimed 
credit for Bella’s progress. It wasn’t until 
LeBlanc discontinued the tutoring ser­
vice that the administration finally rec­
ognized Bella’s decline and need for 
individualized support. But by then, it 
was too late.
Bella’s struggles in school began to 
disrupt her social life and self-esteem. 
The tears eventually devolved into tan­
trums. “She would come home and have 
insane anger outbursts,” said LeBlanc. 
“This was happening several times a week.” 
The second LeBlanc pulled Bella 
out of school and started homeschool­
ing, the outbursts went away.
LeBlanc is not alone in her choice 
to homeschool. According to a 2023 
Washington Post analysis, homeschooling 
has become America’s fastest-increas­
ing form of education. Connecticut’s 
neighboring state, New York, saw a 
103 percent increase in homeschooling 
in 2023 since the 2017-18 school year. 
Though the Connecticut government 
does not keep official records, The 
Education Association of Christian 
Homeschoolers estimated that the 
state’s homeschooling numbers dou­
bled from twenty-two thousand in 2019 
to between forty and forty-five thou­
sand by 2021.
“The steady increase in homeschool­
ers has been happening for a very long 
time, with a clear surge around early 
COVID,” said Diane Connors, founder 
and president of the Connecticut 
Homeschool Network (CHN).
This independence from a larger 
institution is part of what has allowed 
Tony’s classes to continue for so long; 
activities hosted by the New Haven 
Pride Center, for example, have been 
hampered since the nonprofit lost its 
501(c)(3) status for a few months this 
year after failing to file tax returns. 
Tony’s group, on the other hand, does 
not rely directly on institutional support; 
he offers the Saturday morning meet­
ings pro bono, paying for the craft sup­
plies out-of-pocket. Locations in and 
around New Haven allow him to use 
their spaces at no expense for him or the 
families who attend.
This surge in homeschooling in 
the state comes at a time of declining 
public school enrollment. The New 
Haven school district has seen a 12.65 
percent decrease in enrollment in the 
last decade and projects an additional 
1,740 student decrease over the next one 
(out of the current 18,877). 
Yet Connecticut’s unusual home­
schooling policy makes it impossible 
to measure exactly how many parents 
have turned to homeschooling for their 
children. Connecticut is a “no regula­
tion” state, offering zero requirements or 
oversight on its homeschooling families. 
Families are not required to notify the 
school district or state government when 
they pull their children from school.  
Connecticut General Statute §10-
184 requires all parents in the state 
to “instruct [their children] or cause 
them to be instructed” in a list of sub­
jects, including basic literacy, geog­
raphy, arithmetic, and United States 
history and citizenship. “But how, 
when, where, and with what materials 
is strictly left up to the parents,” says 
Attorney Deborah Stevenson, founder 
of the National Home Education Legal 
Defense (NHELD). 
Certain school districts in many of 
Connecticut’s neighboring states, such 
as Rhode Island and Massachusetts, 
ask for curriculum plan portfolios to 
demonstrate homeschoolers’ academic 
progress. Many also require time-to-
time in-person evaluations, standardized 
testing scores, and proof of qualification 
from parents. But Connecticut does not 
require any such proof of instruction, let 
alone proficiency. 
This lack of oversight has concerned 
lawmakers and child advocates, who argue

that it allows cases of abuse or neglect to 
slip through the cracks under the guise of 
homeschooling. Yet parents like LeBlanc 
believe homeschooling properly educates 
children whose learning style marginal­
izes them in public school systems. As 
the debate continues, Connecticut’s lack 
of records and regulations means infor­
mation on families’ actual homeschooling 
practices remains murky.

T
o MANY HOMESCHOOLING PARENTS, 
quality educational experiences go 
beyond academics. “I’m sure my daugh­
ter could learn to read and write, totally 
fine,” New Haven homeschooling parent 
Julia Werth says. On a typical day, Werth 
spends at most thirty to forty minutes 
of structured learning time with her 
pre-Kindergarten daughter. I asked if she 
chose homeschooling because she was 
concerned about the New Haven Public 
Schools’ recent funding deficit. She 
shakes her head.
“I would be fine sending her to 
Nathan Hale [School],” she responds, 
referencing the nearest NHPS elementary 
institution. But the reason Werth keeps 
her daughter at home isn’t centered on 
dissatisfaction with public schools. She 
likes that homeschooling allows her 
individualization, more family time, 
more sleep, more play, less stress regard­
ing testing—the list goes on.
For Katie Self, who homeschools 
her 
second 
grader 
and 
pre-kin­
dergartener, family is a priority. “I 
want to raise my children and be an 
active part of their lives,” she says. 
Homeschooling allows Self to culti­
vate Christian religious and moral val­
ues, uninterrupted by routine external 
schooling. “We love God, so that is 
consistent throughout our whole life. 
We love learning, so that is consistent 
through everything we do.”
LeBlanc’s older daughter, 12-year-
old Elisabeth, left traditional schooling 
in seventh grade. She was previously 
homeschooled from kindergarten to first 
grade. Elisabeth is looking to study neu­
roscience at Yale to better understand her 
grandmothers’ Alzheimer’s diagnoses. 
Elisabeth 
participated 
in 
AGP—
Academically Gifted Program—through­
out elementary school. In her experience, 
however, AGP mostly involved sitting in 
the back of the classroom on a computer, 
learning material she couldn’t share 
with her classmates. “I think that it then 
taught her really to zone out. She dis­
sociates a lot,” said LeBlanc. Her school 
denied LeBlanc’s proposal to let her 
skip a grade. 
Elisabeth is enthusiastic about her 
transition back to homeschooling. “It’s
