Points of Departure
fitness classes, counseling services, and 
cultural events to over three hundred 
clients. Most unique of the Clubhouse’s 
offerings, perhaps, is the Expressive Arts 
Program. It offers therapeutic services 
fueled by artistic expression: dance classes, 
music groups, and visual arts classes.
“It’s a beautiful blend between art 
and psychology,” explained Marisabel 
Sanchez, a New Haven artist and 
Fellowship’s Expressive Arts Coordinator. 
“Typical cognitive-based therapy is about 
thinking about your issues in a different 
way; it’s about changing your perspective 
on the issue you’re facing. Art is similar, 
but more expressive.”
Leo Trang, the first Fellowship client 
to join Sanchez and me in the Clubhouse, 
agreed. Hefty black headphones sat 
around his neck, the wire looped repeat­
edly around the front strap of the brown 
satchel slung over his shoulder.
He spoke with his hands. “I have a 
range of emotions from, like, here to here.” 
He created a spectrum with his palms 
parallel to the ground, one above his head 
and the other at his chest. “Before com­
ing to Fellowship, my mood was always 
low, and the medicine could kind of push 
me up to a normal level.” He moved his 
bottom hand up to his chin. “But the 
medicine locks you into that point.”
Trang was the first person at his 
psychiatrist’s office to ever success­
fully stop taking medication, which 
he attributed entirely to Fellowship. 
Before Fellowship, he tried traditional 
therapy, group therapy, intensive outpa­
tient programs, and a different art pro­
gram––all to no avail. 
Trang attributed Fellowship’s unique 
effectiveness to the autonomy it affords 
its clients. “We’re not just people lumped 
in here––there’s no bell telling us to 
move from class to class,” he said. “We’re 
all actually hanging out together. We’re 
socializing of our own free will.” This 
autonomy, he continued, allowed him to 
build a genuine community that moti­vated him to visit Fellowship consistently.
Charlotte Sabovic, a licensed clini­
cal social worker and the director of the 
Clubhouse, explained that this auton­
omy is foundational to Fellowship’s 
healthcare strategy. “Too much of their 
lives is so prescribed,” Sabovic said. 
“They’ve been told what to do for what­
ever amount of time by too many differ­
ent people. In here, it’s not that at all.”
Trang burst out in agreement: “We 
can actually breathe.”
Sabovic stifled a smile before 
continuing. “It’s a person-centered 
approach,” she said. “We’re here to 
encourage them. It’s led by what they 
want to do, independently.”
To Higgins, for example, Fellowship 
largely serves as a middle-man between 
him and the resources he needs.
Higgins has been heavily involved 
in the New Haven arts scene since 
moving here in 1997, and Fellowship 
brought him a community with which 
his art could grow. In his experimental 
pieces, he explores the relationship 
between 
photography, 
paper, 
and 
light––he creates automatistic pieces, 
which are intended to be interpreted 
distinctly by each viewer.
Through his art, Higgins retroac­
tively observes his mental health. “I can 
look back at my work and think, ‘Oh, 
jeez––that’s what I was feeling.’”
This self-awareness provided him 
the mental stability to pursue the psy­
chiatric care he needed. After working 
with Fellowship for months, he trans­
ferred his psychiatric services to a new 
provider, where he received medication 
that further stabilized his mental health.
When asked about the future of 
Fellowship Place, Guerrera empha­
sized the importance of strengthening 
Fellowship’s physical community. “All I 
want is the dollars to build more hous­
ing,” she said. “Some of these people 
don’t have incomes. The solution to 
this problem isn’t just affordable hous­
ing. We need deeply affordable housing, 
and we need support services.”
With its rent accommodating 
for residents’ incomes, its communi­
ty-based support system, and its case 
management 
resources, 
Fellowship 
seeks to fill this need.∎
