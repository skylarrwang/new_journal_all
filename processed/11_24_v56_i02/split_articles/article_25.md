Payday: A Sestina
For Balbir Singh Sodhi
Mornings spent always the same: your lips forming a line 
Like the horizon squeezing itself against the naked land until drops 
Of blue & violet bleed out. Roadrunners’ twiggy limbs casting
Zigzagging shadows. Headlights blinking awake on rolling hills. Your face 
Ripe with the morning cold. Bombay Sapphire––one shot 
Snaking down your throat. Then prepare to run 
the gift of a green card. Mama’s tears run
Through glitchy WhatsApp calls some days, the line
Cutting any hope of assurance. Some days, she takes a shot
At asking a question. “Coming home?” Her eyes drop
& then you swallow. The selfie screen a blank face
Of arrogance. Mama shaking her head. She cast
Away your dreams for her comfort. In Jalandhar, you cast
Pennies into ponds before your flight. Some run
Of luck that Mama didn’t kill you at the gate. Still face
Her reappearing questions each morning. A line
Of big burly motorbikers sliding you pennies for drops
Of espresso, which you call justification. You took one shot
