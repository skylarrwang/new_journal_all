state to do so—a move that could weigh heavily in 
the state’s decision. 

University president Maurie McInnis has asserted 
that Yale has no agency in the legal system. Weeks 
before the hearing, she told the Yale Daily News that 
the hearing outcome “really isn’t in our hands.” 
“I know people imagine it might be, but it’s 
not,” McInnis said. “Yale is not getting involved.” 

The argument that Yale cannot get involved by 
pressuring prosecutors in the cases against its students 
is perplexing, given that the University ordered the 
protestors arrested in the first place. Beinecke Plaza 
is the university’s private property, so only Yale can 
make final calls about what legally constitutes trespassing. Yale administrators—not the Yale or New 
Haven police departments, the city of New Haven, 
nor the state of Connecticut—called on police to 
descend upon the students that morning. 

Six months after the mass arrest, on the morning 
of Halloween, Hutten and forty other keffiyeh-clad 
students clustered inside the lobby of the 
New Haven Superior Court for their hearing. It 
was either the third or fourth hearing for most of 
the students, depending on whether they appeared 
at a virtual hearing in June. Demonstrators said 
that they and their lawyers pushed for continuances 
from previous hearings to pressure Yale 
into asking the state to drop the charges, a move 
symbolizing their arguments that the University 
should not have involved police and that the students 
should not have been charged in the first 
place. Yale never budged.
“The arrests were an arbitrary and abusive exercise 
of power that Yale knows that it has,” Hutten 
said. “And dropping the charges is one of the first 
bare minimum things that you can do in order to 
start to remedy that situation.”

At the Halloween hearing, about two-thirds of 
the protesters agreed to a deal in which their misdemeanor criminal trespassing charges would be 
lowered to a lesser charge of trespass infraction for 
a ninety-dollar fee.

Hutten and Padilla-Smith were among the 
two-thirds of protesters to agree to the deal, wearied 
by months of litigation, anxious about their 
upcoming appearances in front of the university’s 
executive committee, and eager to focus on campus 
activism in support of the people of Gaza. 

The remaining thirteen students declined to take 
the deal, continuing the fight to get their charges 
dropped at yet another hearing in December.

I spoke to twelve alumni involved in five different 
civil disobedience movements at Yale over 
four decades. All of them expressed a belief that the 
administration cracked down unusually hard on the 
pro-divestment protesters last spring—a break from 
the protections the university has historically provided student protesters. It is unprecedented that 
students arrested en masse spend over six months 
in legal limbo, even more so that thirteen are still 
fighting charges. And over a week after the arrests on 
Beinecke, YPD violently arrested protesters without 
direct orders from administration—setting a precedent that could compromise the safety of student 
protesters and free expression on campus. 

“It did feel strange walking around campus, 
feeling like I have been criminalized by my own 
institution,” Padilla-Smith said. “Yale likes to tout 
its student body as this politically active group of 
people that wants to make a difference in the world, 
but then when you try to actually align yourself 
with those values, they punish you.”

Student activists have carried a unique status throughout history precisely because they are 
students. Those attending elite institutions like Yale 
benefit from their association with powerful institutions that have long protected them from harsh 
recourse in the criminal justice system, allowing 
them to wield their privilege as a tool for change.
“It’s important, the level of privilege these students collectively—not individually—are able to 
summon in terms of attention from the media and 
historically better treatment by police,” said Beth 
Coleman ’91, a former anti-apartheid protester who 
is now a professor at the University of Toronto. In 
the hours after the pro-Palestine Yale students were 
arrested, the story made headlines in The New York 
Times, USA Today, the Washington Post, CNN, and 
dozens of other news outlets.
“These are the people who are credible and can 
risk getting bad grades, but they don’t have to risk 
losing their jobs,” Coleman continued. “They’re able 
to stand up in a principled way for things that need 
to change in the world.”

What distinguishes civil disobedience from 
other forms of peaceful protest is the act of breaking 
rules and welcoming consequences—legal, academic, or professional—to emphasize the gravity 
of a cause on a public stage. Even so, supporters 
of Yale’s arrestees have stressed that the University 
has a duty to protect its students from the potential 
violence of policing and to uphold their freedom 
of expression—even when administrators, trustees, 
and Yale Corporation members disagree with their 
actions and words.

Professor of Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality 
Studies Greta LaFleur, who serves as an attorney 
for dozens of the students arrested last spring, said 
she believes that the university’s choice to involve 
the police to quell the protests later empowered officers to crack down on students, even without direct 
orders from Yale administrators. 

“I don’t think there’s any coincidence whatsoever 
that the arrests were broadly non-violent on the 
part of police behavior on April 22, but the arrests 
on May 1 were brutal,” LaFleur said. “That’s what 
happens when you bring cops on campus to do the 
enforcement of disciplinary procedures or of behavioral policies.”

After April’s mass arrests on Beinecke Plaza, 
police confrontations with protesters had momentarily calmed, despite continuing demonstrations 
and the construction of a second encampment on 
Cross Campus, which police dismantled and dispersed after three days without further arrests.

On May 1, however, a group of demonstrators 
marched around campus, delivering speeches and 
chanting outside of then-President Peter Salovey’s 
home and the YPD station. After a YPD lieutenant 
warned protesters to disperse from the station over 
the speaker of his police car, protest marshal Craig 
Birckhead-Morton ’24 and the other marshals 
directed the protesters to leave, ushering them 
back to central campus. 

“Obviously, we took this warning seriously,” 
Birckhead-Morton said. “The police were caught 
off-guard. I think they really thought that they had 
really defeated us, so they were surprised.”

But as the group approached the walkway 
between Yale Law School and Sterling Memorial 
Library, Birckhead-Morton, who was arrested as 
part of the encampment a week prior, was confused 
to see YPD cars waiting by Beinecke Plaza. A police 
car suddenly drove directly into the crossway to 
block their path. 

Unlike the April 22 arrestees, no one had joined 
this demonstration thinking they were risking arrest. 
Unlike those who had been arrested en masse, they 
hadn’t received training on handling police interactions during nonviolent protests. It was Birckhead-
Morton’s job as a marshal to ensure protesters’ 
safety. But when Birckhead-Morton approached  
Lieutenant Chris Halstead—the same officer who 
ordered demonstrators to leave the YPD station—to 
ask how the protesters were supposed to disperse, 
Halstead grabbed him by the arm, pulling him 
towards the police car. It was Birckhead-Morton’s 
twenty-second birthday, and he had been holding 
his birthday cake. 

“I think it pissed them off that we had been able 
to sustain ourselves after everything that had happened,” Birckhead-Morton said. “The crowd [was] 
outraged, because why are you arresting people who 
are keeping the students safe?”

Protesters crowded around the car as another 
student marshal repeatedly asked Halstead why 
Birckhead-Morton was being arrested. An officer 
placed her under arrest. One person grabbed 
Birckhead-Morton’s other arm to tug him away 
from Halstead, who was eventually able to handcuff 
him. From the window of the police car, Birckhead-
Morton watched as another officer held a protester 
from the New Haven community against a squad 
car. A second officer broke through protesters and

tackled another New Havener. Chief of Police 
Anthony Campbell ’95 DIV ’09, aided by three other 
officers, kneeled on the protester’s back for over 
ninety seconds. The protester emerged with a bleeding nose and cut face.
“It seemed like the cops were kind of on a bit 
of a power trip,” said Rebecca Wessel ’24, a student 
organizer who was present for the May 1 arrests. 
“And maybe wanting to assert power after they had 
seen how many people were rallying against them at 
the YPD office.”

Duane Lovello, Head of Public Safety, released 
a statement on the May 1 arrests on August 26. An 
external review of the incident, it disclosed, found 
that probable cause supported each arrest, but “the 
arrests taken in total did not follow best practices,” 
including on crowd control and the disproportionate 
force used in one of the arrests.

In an email exchange dated May 4 obtained by 
student journalist Theia Chatelle ’25, YPD Assistant 
Chief of Police Von Narcisse wrote to Campbell 
that the pro-Palestine demonstrators “are pathetic 
and sad,” going on to criticize the protests as a 
“sad attempt to attack Yale” that is unrelated to the 
events in Israel and Gaza. 
“I agree 100 percent. There [sic] actions are like 
a small group of vandals and criminals rather than 
protesters,” Campbell replied. 

In response to a request for comment, Campbell 
did not answer inquiries regarding the email 
exchange or the events of April 22 and May 1. He 
confirmed that the YPD advisory committee, a civilian review board created to ensure police accountability, is no longer active and said that the university 
is “considering refinements to its scope of advisory 
responsibilities.” When Birckhead-Morton was a 
student, he was part of the committee.  

Whose Beinecke?
the occupy beinecke encampment drew in part 
from one of the most famous instances of student 
civil disobedience in Yale history: the anti-apartheid 
protests of the 1980s, in which students fought for 
Yale to divest from companies with holdings in South 
Africa. On Instagram, posts that included side-by-
side photos from the pro-Palestine demonstrations 
and the anti-apartheid protests garnered thousands 
of likes. Yet alumni told me that the details of the 
arrests and administrative responses at the two protests differed, revealing an increasing hostility toward 
student protesters last spring.” 

For ten days in April 1986, Matthew Countryman 
’86 and about twenty other Yale students slept atop 
soggy newspapers, packed together inside rickety 
wood and aluminum forts on Beinecke Plaza. 

After a year of rising dissent on campus, the 
anti-apartheid protesters set up a cluster of structures, 
aiming to resemble the poor and crowded urban 
shanties where Black South Africans were forced 
to live by the country’s white minority. Like the 
pro-Palestine protesters who erected the Beinecke 
encampment, the Coalition Against Apartheid 
activists never asked the university for permission to 
pitch up the shanties. 

“University investment was the rationale for our 
violation of the university policy. In other words, the 
university was pursuing immoral policies in South 
Africa, and that gave us the right,” Countryman told 
me this September.

The organizers of Beinecke Plaza’s newly erected 
“Winnie Mandela City” deliberately chose April 
4th, 1986, for the shanties’ debut. It was the 18-year 
anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination. 
It was also the weekend that the Yale Corporation 
would meet in person. Each day that week, hundreds 
gathered for rallies protesting Yale’s investments in 
companies doing business in South Africa.  

The Winnie Mandela City first came down ten 
days after it went up. The Yale Police Department 
had given a final warning for student protesters to 
vacate the plaza by midnight. Similar to the events 
of April 22, 2024, arrests happened early the next 
morning. About three dozen Yale Police officers 
descended on the plaza at dawn to arrest seventy-
two students and four New Haven community 
members. Countryman chose to go limp as officers 
dragged him away, pleading with them to not take 
him from his home.

Police loaded students into buses and took them 
to the city jail, where they were then booked and 
quickly released. 

The first round of arrests in April 1986 drew massive backlash from public figures in local and state 
politics. Within the Yale community, distaste was 
even stronger. 

Democrats from the Connecticut House of 
Representatives even proposed a bill to revoke Yale’s 
charter in the state constitution over the arrests; 
House minority leader Irving Stolberg declared that 
“Yale has clamped down in an arbitrary and arrogant 
manner… rather than encouraging dialogue.”

One hundred and fifty-six faculty members signed 
a statement expressing disapproval of Yale’s arrests of 
its students. It asserted that the university was guilty 
of “breaking an important tradition of trust among all 
members of the University community with regard to 
the free expression of divergent viewpoints.” 

The outrage produced quick results. A faculty 
committee, convened by administrators, announced 
that the university had to allow student activists to 
reconstruct the Winnie Mandela City and let it remain 
until the start of June. The permission was contingent 
on the shanties not preventing others’ use of the plaza 
as a thoroughfare or a space for other gatherings. 

In the following three days, two more rounds of 
arrests occurred at other apartheid-related, pro-divestment demonstrations.

Protesters were charged with misdemeanors, but 
about a week after the arrests, prosecutors exchanged 
those charges for infractions on their own accord. 
This time, prosecutors offered arrestees a deal: plead 
not-guilty or donate twenty-five dollars to a charity 
organization and drop the infractions immediately. 
Otherwise, the state would automatically enter
