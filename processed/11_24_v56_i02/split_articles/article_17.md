EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Just an hour and twenty minutes away from 
Old Saybrook, where Priscila’s family would 
eventually settle, and mere days after the murder 
of Fernando Villavicencio in 2023, Angélica Idrovo 
got a call at her home in Danbury. It was Carlos 
Córdova, an immigration organizer she knew 
through the Danbury Ecuadorian Civic Center. 
Ángelica left Ecuador when she was twelve, and 
became involved with immigration advocacy groups 
in high school. Carlos had a background in unions 
and worker’s rights associations in Ecuador, which 
expanded to include immigration work once he 
resettled.

“Anghy,” she remembers Carlos saying over the 
phone, “we want to hold a meeting to talk about 
what Ecuador is going through. We want to talk 
about the killing…We’re going to pitch the idea of 
fighting for TPS.”

Angélica replied in an instant. “Perfect, count 
me in.”

TPS confers three main benefits on qualifying 
individuals during its period of designation: 1) they 
are not removable from the United States; 2) they 
can obtain an employment authorization document 
(EAD); and 3) they may be granted travel authoriza­
tion. For some 162,000 Ecuadorians who are undoc­
umented in the U.S., these protections would be 
nothing short of life-changing.

When Priscila speaks to me about her family’s 
first few months in America, during which they 
had no official papers beyond their tourist visas, 
she is full of remembered anxiety. “I’m telling you, 
it’s like being on edge constantly, with the constant 
worry of when they might arrest you,” she says. “If 
they ask for your papers, and you don’t have them—
you’re committing a crime. And you don’t want to 
commit a crime because you’re not a bad person, 
but you’re forced to do it out of necessity.”

Indeed, the lack of legal documents compli­
cates every aspect of life in this country for people 
like Priscila. For one, it prevents them from seek­
ing legal employment, forcing migrants to turn 
to informal and poorly regulated labor markets. 
Antonio Arízaga, a New York-based activist who 
presides over the United Front for Ecuadorian 
Immigrants, tells me that some undocumented 
Ecuadorians in this country work twelve, four­
teen, even sixteen hours a day in restaurants, 
produce markets, and similar places, earning 
less-than-minimum wages. “Simply put, they are 
exploited,” he says.

A formal U.S. source of income also makes it eas­
ier to build a credit score and sign a lease. Lacking 
both when she first arrived, Priscila tells me no one 
would rent to her in Connecticut. The family had to 
relocate to Minnesota for several months to access 
a lease that accommodated their needs, and they 
weren’t able to return to Connecticut until after they 
had filed asylum claims.

Arízaga emphasizes the third benefit of TPS. It 
allows Ecuadorians to apply for a travel permit to 
return to Ecuador for urgent matters such as the 
illness or death of a family member, without fear­
ing that they will not be able to re-enter the U.S. 
Perhaps even more important than being let 
back into the country, however, is being safe from 
deportation in the first place. TPS protects benefi­
ciaries against forced removal, a crucial provision 
for people with a high risk of being detained by 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), such 
as immigrant day laborers, who must venture into 
busy public spaces each day to seek work. 

Without TPS, Ecuadorian day workers in 
Connecticut have to withstand repeated crack­
downs from ICE. One famous example is the 2006 
case of the “Danbury 11,” a group of Ecuadorian men 
who were peacefully assembled at Kennedy Park in 
Danbury one morning before a van of undercover 
city police officers showed up and offered them 
work. The van took the men who accepted to a park­
ing lot, where, as soon as they stepped off, ICE agents 
jumped out and arrested them. All of the men were 
subsequently placed into deportation proceedings 
based on statements they gave after being seized.

Yale Law School Professor Michael J. Wishnie 
’87, LAW ’93 led a team of student volunteers in 
efforts to get the men released on bond. “Many 
immigrants with meritorious defenses forgo those 
defenses because it is too costly to pursue them,” he 
tells me. Wishnie and his students argued that the 
arrests had violated their clients’ rights under the 
Fourth Amendment.

After five years and countless legal maneuvers, 
the YLS team eventually won six hundred thousand 
dollars from the City of Danbury and the Federal 
Government for eight of the men. It was the larg­
est settlement in the history of civil-rights actions 
brought by day laborers. ICE agreed to grant the men 
deferred action status. And yet, two of the original 
eleven men were still deported.

Today, TPS could change legal outcomes for 
the tens of thousands of Ecuadorian immigrants 
at risk of deportation who don’t have access to the 
resources and goodwill of America’s top law schools.

Angélica and Carlos held their first meet­
ing in Danbury in August, 2023, eight days 
after Villavicencio’s murder. About a dozen people, 
mainly leaders from local advocacy groups and cul­
tural centers, convened to discuss the implications 
of the violence in Ecuador for immigrants in the U.S. 
It was clear to them that under those conditions, it 
wasn’t safe for people like Priscila to go back.

A few weeks later, a second meeting was called. 
Then a third, this time in Stamford. About sixty 
people showed up. A fourth meeting in Danbury. 
Then Meriden. Then New Haven. Leaders from 
these and other cities like Bridgeport, Stamford, 
and Norwalk decided to form a steering committee, 
with Ángelica and Carlos at the head. Engagement 
was increasing slowly but steadily.


Then, in January of this year, the movement sud­
denly gained explosive traction—there had been new 
developments back home. 

In the first weeks of 2024, a terrifying wave of 
riots broke out in Ecuador, first inside most major 
prisons and then across the country. Gangs kid­
napped police officers, detonated explosives in the 
streets, and set cars on fire as devices of intimidation. 
In Guayaquil, a group of hooded men stormed a 
news studio during a national broadcast and pointed 
firearms at the heads of journalists. Eleven people 
died in just a few days. More than 850 were arrested.

In an exceptional exercise of executive power, 
President Daniel Noboa declared a state of “internal 
armed conflict” and unleashed the military upon the 
country’s gangs in an attempt to calm the ongoing 
riots. Back in the U.S., this created a surge of inter­
est in the TPS movement that had been taking shape 
in Connecticut. “It was in that instant that Ecuador 
met the conditions for designation,” Arízaga told me.

Under the Immigration Act of 1990, the 
Secretary of Homeland Security has the discretion 
to grant TPS to countries under three scenarios: an 
ongoing armed conflict (such as civil war); an envi­
ronmental disaster (such as an earthquake, hurri­
cane, or epidemic); and what is simply described as 
“extraordinary and temporary conditions.”

Prior to the January riots, Angélica’s team had 
devised a policy strategy to prove that the violence 
in Ecuador amounted to “extraordinary conditions,” 
a hard claim to prove due to the vagueness of the 
legal language. But Noboa’s declaration of an inter­
nal conflict prompted them to realign their plan.

“The hope now,” Angélica tells me, “is that 
Ecuador will qualify for TPS under the condition of 
‘ongoing armed conflict,’ which is far more concrete.”

In 2024, Angélica and Carlos’ Connecticut-
born movement began to gather national 
momentum, converging with more recent, inde­
pendent campaigns nationwide. Angélica says 
she connected with activists from New York, 
Minnesota, Utah, and California, all assembling 
their local communities to talk about the same 
goal: securing TPS for Ecuadorians.

In January, advocacy groups in New York, 
Pennsylvania, and Connecticut delivered letters to 
Ecuadorian officials across East Coast consulates, 
asking their government to endorse the petition 
for TPS with Washington. On January 23, Ecuador 
officially requested TPS for its migrants through a 
formal petition to the Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS). However, every activist I talked to 
stressed that the Ecuadorian government’s sup­
port has been far from vigorous. President Daniel 
Noboa has come to the U.S. on several official visits 
since he took office in January, and not once did he 
speak about TPS.

On February 22, 2024, New York organizers 
secured a meeting with three members of Congress, 
including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, to 
request their support in advocating for TPS with 
officials in the DHS. Exactly a month later, Ocasio-
Cortez led twenty-four members of Congress in 
sending a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security 
Alejandro Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony 
Blinken emphasizing the urgency of TPS as a mea­
sure for keeping Ecuadorian immigrants in the 
U.S. safe from the violence 
facing their home coun­
try. The same week, lead­
ers from major East Coast 
cities formed a National 
Coalition of Ecuadorians for 
TPS, inviting every state with 
a TPS advocacy movement 
to join forces. In June, the 
coalition organized a march 
to D.C., with people coming 
from as far as Florida and 
Utah to voice their support 
for the cause.

Less than a week after 
the march, the coalition’s 
leaders were called to a 
meeting with officials from 
the 
White 
House 
and 
Departments of State and 
Homeland Security. At the 
meeting, Angélica said Homeland Security rep­
resentatives told her and the other leaders that a 
joint committee was working on a report to assess 
whether Ecuador qualified for TPS. As of early 
November, the coalition hasn’t heard back from 
the department.

Despite the delayed response, activists still 
hold out hope for a favorable policy outcome—
even in the face of Trump’s victory in the pres­
idential election earlier this month. They expect 
the Biden administration will act swiftly in the 
coming months to safeguard protections for vul­
nerable communities before Republicans regain 
control of the executive branch in January.

With Trump promising mass deportations 
for his second term, approving TPS before he takes 
office would provide a buffer for Ecuadorians at risk 
of being sent back to a country ravaged by organized 
gang violence. For people like Priscila, this protec­
tion could mean the difference between life and 
death. What’s more, it could endure well beyond 
Trump’s inauguration, even if he tries to repeal it. 
Trump has tried and failed to rescind TPS des­
ignations for several countries in the past: first for 
Nicaragua in 2017 and then for El Salvador in 2018. 
His attempts were challenged in federal court, lead­
ing to a 2018 injunction that temporarily blocked 
the terminations—and bought Nicaraguans and 
Salvadorians years of TPS protection, even as the 
administration sought to phase it out.

Activists hope for that sort of protection 
against Trump’s mass deportation policies for 
Ecuadorians, too. The coalition’s plan is to con­
tinue pressuring Mayorkas throughout the year.

Many will face 
deportation to a 
country overwhelmed 
by violence before 
Trump’s inauguration 
in January, and, if 
Mayorkas doesn’t 
heed the community’s 
calls, many more 
after that.

Carlos and Angélica talk to me about 
how proud they are of the concrete victories 
their campaign has already achieved: lawmakers 
they met with, letters to high-ranking officials, 
protesters in high numbers assembled outside of 
Congress. They have had to fight for every inch 
of ground they’ve gained in public life. They’ve 
known what it’s like to be undocumented.

To be undocumented is to be denied the 
same political representation as everyone 
else in the country where one lives and works, 
while still being subjected to the same laws. To 
be undocumented is to be denied the right to 
vote. To be undocumented is to be dispossessed 
of the most essential tools for political agency. 
And yet, undocumented people still find ways to 
call upon those in power.

“Someone has to speak out for us—not in 
the name of a political party, not in the name 
of any candidate, but in the name of the com­
munity, that community that’s out there on the 
ground, that wakes up early to work in the fields, 
in the restaurants,” Carlos says. “It should be us 
who put forward this proposal.”

Angélica knows how much time it takes for 
independent activism to take shape. “I’ve been 
at this for a while,” she says. “It doesn’t hap­
pen in a day.” For now, she reflects on the work 
ahead. “Something that helps me a lot,” she 
tells me as our conversation draws to a close, “is 
reminding myself that hope, at the end of the 
day, is a discipline.”

It may yet take more hope, and discipline, 
before Ecuadorians are granted the protec­
tions of TPS. Many will face deportation to 
a country overwhelmed by violence before 
Trump’s inauguration in January, and, if 
Mayorkas doesn’t heed the community’s calls, 
many more after that.

Still, though the policy outcome remains 
uncertain, the significance of the underlying 
activism should not be overlooked. Through 
the TPS campaign, this community has built 
an advocacy network that stretches across 
the country. It has shown that even though 
hundreds of thousands of Ecuadorians in 
this country may lack legal papers, they are 
not without political agency. In that respect, 
the consequences of this movement for 
Ecuadorian organizing will far outlive a second 
Trump term.∎
