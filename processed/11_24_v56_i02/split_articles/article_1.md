Dear readers,

Where do individuals go when they’re left unprotected by institutions? In 
Volume 57, Issue II of The New Journal, they turn to each other. 

Seven months ago, we witnessed the mass arrest of pro-Palestine student 
protesters on Beinecke Plaza. In our cover story, Megan Vaz traces the 
protracted legal battle for arrested students and the unusual ways the 
administration cracked down on protests last spring, probing the question 
of what protections a university ought to provide its students—and what 
happens when that trust fractures. 

In his feature on the fight to secure Temporary Protected Status for 
Ecuadorians in the United States, Matías Guevara Ruales follows one 
woman’s escape from organized violence in Ecuador and the nationwide 
grassroots campaign to protect migrants from deportation.

Elsewhere in the city, people create their own communities when established 
spaces fail. Kelly Kong talks to parents defending their right to homeschool 
their children independent of governmental restrictions. Andrew Storino 
asks what it means to build a community around disability, an identity 
often private and invisible. A communist reading group unites around the 
promise of revolution, a therapeutic support center models holistic care, and 
a group of activists brings their own experiences with food insecurity to their 
organizing. 

In this issue about people uniting around the causes they believe in, the 
words of Ecuadorian-American activist Angélica Idrovo come to bear. 
“Hope,” she reminds us, “at the end of the day, is a discipline.”

With gratitude,
Maggie, Chloe, Aanika, Sam
