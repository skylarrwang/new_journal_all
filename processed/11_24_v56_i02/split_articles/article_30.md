After college, Di Maria decided to set­
tle in New Haven to pursue a career as 
a music educator. While he didn’t expect 
to plant roots in Connecticut, he ended 
up investing in the vibrant music scene 
and became a local teacher. “The rest was 
history,” he reflected.


Di Maria sees jazz as a lifeline for 
himself and for the city. To him, jazz in 
a smaller town like New Haven fosters 
a strong sense of community. “Philly, 
Wilmington, Tampa, Pittsburgh, they’re 
all similar cases to New Haven. You don’t 
have to be from New York to grow up 
with this music, to grow up in a jazz city,” 
Di Maria said. “The Underground is try­
ing to preserve that spirit, trying to keep 
that idea going that jazz doesn’t have to 
just thrive in a major metropolitan area. 
It could be somewhere like your own 
town, you know.”


The Underground defines itself as 
a “grassroots, community-based orga­
nization” that hosts clinics, shows, and 
jam sessions with locally and nationally 
renowned musicians at venues like Cafe 
Nine, The Cannon, and Three Sheets 
multiple times a month. Traditional 
event series like Tuesday Night Jazz 
at Cafe Nine fuel a symbiotic rela­
tionship between local musicians and 
the Underground, who count on the 
Monterey, is now a distant memory—
peeling crimson paint, graffiti tags, and 
wooden beams cover up what was once a 
national jazz hub. 


Conscious of this history and des­
perate to keep New Haven jazz alive, 
organizations like Jazz Haven, founded 
in 1996, and the New Haven Jazz 
Underground, founded in 2006, began 
working to preserve the spirit and legacy 
of the genre in the city. 


Jazz Haven is a not-for-profit orga­
nization that organizes jazz festivals and 
listening events around New Haven, 
such as weekly jazz listening nights at 
the Institute Library on Chapel Street.


Meanwhile, according to its founder, 
Nick Di Maria, the New Haven Jazz 
Underground’s goal is to “preserve and 
flourish jazz culture” by hosting weekly 
jazz shows around the city.

Di Maria, a musician himself, started 
playing the trumpet in 1994.
 To put it simply, he said, he instantly 
“fell in love” with the instrument—and 
with jazz. 


While he grew up just outside of 
New Haven, he visited often to see 
his uncle and fell in love with the city. 
Underground to find gigs within the New 
Haven area, as well as between musicians 
and the greater New Haven community.


Back at Cafe Nine, Di Maria intro­
duces Ed Cherry’s performance. 
“New Haven is a jazz city, through 
and through,” Di Maria says. “We’ve got 
to keep that alive. Thank you to Ed for 
coming out and performing here tonight. 
A true jazz legend.”

Ed Cherry was born in New Haven. 
He moved to New York in 1978 to 
play guitar for jazz legend Dizzy Gillespie 
for 14 years. After Gillespie’s death in 1993, 
he began his solo career. On stage, Cherry 
is suave, cool, and collected. His guitar is 
like an extension of self, a phantom limb. 
When he’s performing, he and his instru­
ment are one.


The crowd at Cafe Nine this October 
evening feels familiar. It’s clear that many 
audience members know one another; 
they catch up over a beer at the bar as 
Cherry and his band play on stage. Warm 
lights flicker as the crowd murmurs.  
After the show, a line of people queue 
up to share a word with him. Some are 
old friends; some are fans; some are fel­
low musicians inspired by his craft.

“I’m a guitar player, too,” a mid­
dle-aged, bespectacled man tells Cherry. “I 
just got back from picking up my daugh­
ter from school, man, but I knew I had to 
make it here before the show ended.”


Other audience members chime in, 
nudging their way toward Cherry, who, 
at 6-foot-5, towers over the crowd. “Great 
show, Ed!” “What a talent.” “Nice to see 
you, man.”


Cherry’s mastery of the strings, to be 
frank, intimidates me. Watching him play, 
I’m catapulted back to mornings spent on 
my childhood bedroom floor, plucking 
away at my Yamaha acoustic in my des­
perate yearning to translate my 15-year-
old thoughts into music form. I plucked 
and strummed and tapped my finger 
against the body of its bronzed wood on 
the daily. I never got very good. Cherry’s 
playing—the dynamics of it, the soul—
contains deep emotion and reflection. 
The music he plays is alive.


I muster up the courage to get a 
word in. “Awesome show,” I say. “I’ve 
been learning guitar for a few years now. 
You’re a master.” Cherry smiles warmly, 
nods. “That’s great.” He coughs, turns. 
“Keep it up.” Then he walks to the bar, 
sits down alongside the audience mem­
bers—friends, family, and community 
members—waiting for him, and orders 
himself a drink. ∎
