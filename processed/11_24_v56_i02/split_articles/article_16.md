Colorful floats descended toward the 
New Haven Green on the morning of August 
18th. Ecuadorian and American flags waved 
from motorcycles, jeeps, pickup trucks, even a 
Hummer limousine. Dancers in traditional dress 
swept into the park as vendors sold cevicho­
cho and cotton candy out of the trunks of their 
cars. Children carried their own miniature flags. 
Balloons rose, and wild honks filled the air.


As Yale’s newest undergraduates were moving 
into Old Campus, hundreds of Ecuadorians gath­
ered on the Green across the street to commem­
orate the 1809 uprising that kicked off Ecuador’s 
long struggle for independence from colonial rule. 
Each year, the local Ecuadorian community—the 
sixth largest among the foreign-born population 
of New Haven County—celebrates this holiday by 
holding a parade.


The festivities began just outside 1 Church 
Street, where the Consulate of Ecuador in 
Connecticut shares a building with a Yale School 
of Public Health research center. (The consul­
ate is one of only three foreign missions in the 
state of Connecticut, and the only one outside of 
Hartford.)


This year, leading the parade were Angélica 
Idrovo and Carlos Córdova, among other repre­
sentatives of local community organizations. They 
marched shoulder-to-shoulder, in step with the 
music. They looked determined. Together, they car­
ried a sign that read:
PODER COMUNITARIO
TPS FOR ECUADOR.


The banner was a call to action. Connecticut 
immigration activists like Angélica and Carlos 
have been trying to get the United States’ govern­
ment to designate Ecuador as a country eligible for 
Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over a year. 
The TPS designation—enshrined in federal law as a 
safeguard for people whose home countries are dan­
gerous to return to—would protect undocumented 
Ecuadorians from deportation and allow them to 
legally seek work for a defined period. With an 
ongoing wave of gang violence and an energy crisis 
currently facing the South American nation, activ­
ists say such a measure is more than justified; send­
ing undocumented Ecuadorians back home under 
the current conditions can put their lives in danger.


Connecticut has long been an epicenter for 
Ecuadorian life and activism in the U.S. Possessing 
the fifth-largest Ecuadorian population in the entire 
country, the state is home to numerous associations 
of Ecuadorians that regularly lead advocacy efforts 
to address their communities’ needs. In 2008, this 
activism played an important role in helping to 
establish the Ecuadorian Consulate in New Haven, 
which now services migrant communities in Maine, 
Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, and New 
Hampshire, in addition to Connecticut.


In August of 2023, escalating violence in Ecuador 
prompted a group of local Connecticut activists to 
start lobbying for TPS. The campaign has since spun 
into a grassroots coalition with advocacy hubs across 
the U.S., engaging over thirty-five federal legislators 
and executive officials, as well as senior members of 
the Ecuadorian government. Their efforts have forged 
new ways for largely undocumented Ecuadorian pop­
ulations across the country to exercise political influ­
ence at the national level. 


From his office at 1 Church Street, Consul 
General of Ecuador Julio Prado Espinosa tells 
me that violence, especially extortion by criminal 
gangs, has come to surpass family reunification 
and poor employment conditions as the number 
one cause for resettling reported among the 70,000 
patrons in the Consulate’s jurisdiction.


At a national level, the number of Ecuadorians 
attempting to enter the U.S. has surged dramati­
cally in recent years. As of September 2024, 122,072 
encounters with Ecuadorian nationals were reported 
by Customs and Border Protection this year along 
the Southwest border, a 5.03 percent increase over 
2023 and a 407.4 percent increase over 2022. 


For most Ecuadorian migrants coming to the 
U.S., the only possible route runs through the dense 
rainforests of Central America before reaching the 
U.S.–Mexico border. Prior to 2021, when Mexico 
started requiring tourist visas for Ecuadorians, peo­
ple could fly to Mexico before continuing their 
journey north. Today, even if migrants manage to 
cross the perilous Darién Gap and reach Mexico 
by land, life-threatening challenges await once they 
arrive: kidnappings by drug cartels, unreliable coy­
otes, the absence of an Ecuadorian embassy to fall 
back on if things go wrong, and, at the end of the 
road, a heavily patrolled border where both Mexican 
and American agents stand ready to detain those 
attempting to cross.


Still, thousands of Ecuadorians arrive on U.S. 
soil every month, their incentives to reach a safe 
haven stronger than the military-grade equipment 
used to keep them out.


Priscila Rivadeneira arrived in Connecticut in 
2022. She is 36 years old, a mother of two girls, ages 
8 and 11, and lives in Old Saybrook, CT—just thirty 
minutes from the Consulate in downtown New Haven. 
Between twelve-hour shifts at work, afternoon classes 
at Three Rivers Community College, and the morn­
ing rush to get her daughters ready for school, she can 
barely spare the time to grant me an interview. When 
we finally manage to align our schedules, it’s Friday 
night, her one day off. “You know how it is on days off,” 
she says, “there’s just more work to do… helping out 
my sister, the girls—it never stops.” 


Priscila calls her current line—or lines—of work 
“extemporáneos.” For now, she has a relatively stable 
job, taking care of an “elderly American lady,” una 
ancianita americana. She likes it. It keeps her busy 
Saturday through Thursday. Over the past two years 
she has also had to take on work doing nails and 
cutting hair, learning through YouTube videos and 
similar self-taught methods. “I’m bad with my hands, 
really,” she tells me. “I never thought I’d be doing 
things like these for work.” 


Back home, in Ecuador, Priscila was a lawyer 
and a business owner. She lived in the Andean city 
of Cuenca where she and her husband started a car 
dealership back in 2011. She used to manage the legal 
department. She tells me a story of hard-earned social 
mobility: resettling from her rural hometown to a large 
city, getting married, starting a family, opening a busi­
ness. Eventually, the couple’s efforts afforded them 
“stability, both economic and social.” They had children. 
They traveled, both in Ecuador and abroad. They set­
tled comfortably into the ranks of an entrepreneurial 
middle class. “We were doing well,” she reminisces 
with a distant stare. “It was the fruit of our labor.”


Historically, Ecuador has been a peace­
ful nation. Even though the country is tucked 
between Colombia and Peru—two cocaine-pro­
ducing powerhouses that have long contended with 
violent guerilla forces and militant groups tied to 
the drug trade—for most of this century, Ecuador 
ranked among its more developed neighbors like 
Chile or Argentina in violence indicators.


During the late 2000s and early 2010s, the 
nation experienced the largest oil boom in its history. 
Under the administration of then-President Rafael 
Correa—who has since been convicted of bribery 
in the context of a multimillion-dollar corruption 
scheme—hundreds of public schools, clinics, roads, 
and houses were built all over the country. The poor­
est 40 percent of Ecuadorians saw their incomes grow
eight times more than the national average. There was 
the promise of a welfare state on the horizon, the prom­
ise of a repatriation program for the tens of thousands 
of migrants who had left in the 1980s, the promise of a 
bright future, and an everlasting source of export reve­
nue buried under everyone’s feet to fuel it all.


That changed in 2016, when the FARC—a 
Colombian guerilla group that controlled 60 per­
cent of the world’s most productive coca crops at 
the time—signed a peace deal with the Colombian 
government, effectively demobilizing a fifty-year 
insurgency and creating an enormous power vac­
uum in the cocaine trade. Foreign organized crime 
groups began flooding into Ecuador. Each sought 
a slice of the country’s newly competitive—and 
highly lucrative—drug transportation routes.


Collusion networks between organized crime 
groups and government officials which had formed 
under Correa and a fall in oil prices toward the end 
of the 2010s allowed criminal organizations like 
Los Choneros, Los Lobos, and Los Tiguerones to 
take hold for years to come.


In 2023, eleven days before citizens voted 
for 
a 
new 
president, 
candidate 
Fernando 
Villavicencio—a former journalist who repeatedly 
called for stronger measures against drug gangs—
was shot and killed by a group of Colombian 
hitmen as he left a political rally in Quito. The 
Attorney General’s Office found evidence linking 
Villavicencio’s murder to the Lobos gang.


Years before they made national headlines, 
however, criminal organizations like Los Lobos 
were already spreading fear through the streets of 
the major cities.


Priscila says it started in 2019, when a 
series of mysterious men began showing up 
at the car dealership asking to talk to her and 
her husband. Random cars started looking eerily 
familiar. Motorcycles constantly flashed in and 
out of her rearview mirror, trailing her like shad­
ows on the road. She began to recognize the 
same young man in a helmet around town. “At 
the beginning, you’re in your own world. You 
drive your car and you feel fine. But you start 
realizing at some point that it’s the same bike, 
it’s the same guy everywhere and it’s no coinci­
dence,” she said.


The men who showed up at the office wanted 
money. Five thousand dollars every month. 
They identified themselves as members of Los 
Choneros, a drug syndicate based in the coastal 
city of Guayaquil. In exchange for the monthly 
installments, they promised to invest in firearms, 
explosives, patrol cars—“defense equipment” to 
protect the neighborhood from rival gangs.


“I had neighbors who paid,” recalls Priscila. 
“They paid because they were afraid.” Priscila held 
out at first; five thousand dollars every month was 
not a sum her family could spare.


One day, she received a 
call about a car sale opportu­
nity in a town in Guayas, not 
far from the border of her 
home province. Transactions 
like this were common; she 
often took trips around the 
country to buy and sell cars. 
On this occasion, Priscila 
and her husband decided to 
take their daughters with 
them for a family trip.


When the family arrived 
at the meeting location, they 
found no one there. After a 
tense twenty-minute wait, 
two armed men pulled over 
abruptly 
on 
motorcy­
cle. They began to harass 
Priscila’s 
husband 
with 
threats, insults, and their 
firearms. “When I saw that, I 
swear, I thought it was all going to end there, that 
our lives were going to end,” Priscila remembers. 
“I thought those people were going to shoot us on 
the spot.” She crouched inside the car and cov­
ered her daughters’ eyes.


The men told Priscila’s husband that if he 
didn’t pay them five thousand dollars every month, 
they were going to hurt his family. They said they 
were going to kill his daughters.


The Rivadeneiras tried every possible legal 
avenue to protect themselves. They filed a police 
report. They appealed to local prosecutors and 
other authorities for protection. But Ecuador’s 
weakened law enforcement system failed to stop 
the threats. Eventually, the family decided to leave 
the country. They had relatives in Connecticut. 
They came to the U.S. on tourist visas. They 
brought as many of their belongings as they man­
aged. They left everything else behind.


“If they ask for your 
papers, and you don’t 
have them—you’re 
committing a crime. 
And you don’t want 
to commit a crime 
because you’re not 
a bad person, but 
you’re forced to do it 
out of necessity.”


At this year’s Independence parade, local Ecuadorians gather to celebrate.
