and elsewhere have argued that the rise 
in accommodations can be attributed to 
a historical lack of resource-awareness 
amongst students, and a growing num­
ber of students with long-term disabili­
ties enrolling in college.
Kimberly 
McKeown, 
who 
has 
directed SAS since 2021, doesn’t attri­
bute the growing number of accommo­
dations to any single factor but notes 
that the office saw a higher number of 
requests, specifically for mental health 
conditions, following the pandemic. SAS 
does not keep disaggregated data for 
instances of each particular disability. 
Mckeown noted, anecdotally, a dramatic 
increase in students seeking accommo­
dations for dyslexia. 


in some cases, the experience of 
receiving accommodations changes not 
only a student’s practical relationship 
to living and studying at Yale but also 
their identity.
“I didn’t have much experience 
with accommodations before I came 
here,” Nida Khan ’24, a mentor in Yale’s 
Disability Peer Mentors Program, remem­
bers. “I came to college not really knowing 
what my disability was. I was just sick and 
I had nerve pain in my hands.” 
Khan’s recognition of her disability, 
and her evaluation and diagnosis, came 
only after she had struggled with chal­
lenges she could not name.
“I progressively kept getting worse 
and worse each semester,” Khan recalls. 
“It got to the point where I realized, okay, 
this isn’t just that college is hard; this is 
something specific.” 
accommodations themselves: Are they 
effective? Are they fraudulent? 
These debates overlook another 
question. Even as more students seek 
support from Yale, these students remain 
decentralized and often invisible to one 
another by virtue of their shared hidden 
identity. With these challenges, what 
would it mean to form a community 
with disabled identity at its center?


yale’s Resource Office on Disabilities 
was founded in 1982 and renamed 
Student Accessibility Services in 2019. 
The office assisted its first cohort of twen­
ty-four students in 1983-84. Early history 
of its operations is scarce, but the office 
describes itself as established “in response 
to the growing population of students 
with disabilities enrolled” at Yale. 
This “growing population” has roots 
in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Section 
504 of the act mandated that “no quali­
fied individual with a disability in the 
United States shall be excluded from, 
denied the benefits of, or be subjected 
to discrimination” under any program 
receiving federal financial assistance. The 
law’s passage would have outsized effects 
on colleges throughout the country, but 
only with time. The federal government’s 
initial failure to implement Section 
504, spurred by lobbying from employ­
ers reluctant to change hiring practices, 
led to protests and sit-ins around the 
country in the summer of 1977. It was 
only after these efforts, that Section 504 
became widely known and enforced in 
schools and workplaces nationwide.
Similar spikes at institutions across 
the country have provoked responses 
ranging from concern to praise. In “The 
Chronicle of Higher Education”, James 
Madison University professor Alan 
Levinovitz called for a scaling-back of 
accommodations and pushed “study-
skill programs, peer-support groups, and 
temporary interventions” as alternatives. 
These measures, he argued, would “help 
students make it through stressful peri­
ods without giving them a permanent 
biogenetic explanation for their chal­
lenges.” For Levinovitz, the over-med­
icalization of students’ struggles diverts 
attention away from other sources of 
the difficulties they encounter, such as 
academic underpreparedness and men­
tal health, while also diminishing the 
weight of more serious medical diagno­
ses. On the other hand, advocates at the 
U.S. Government Accountability Office 


Khan was diagnosed outside of 
Yale, but began receiving accommoda­
tions via SAS. Some were common, like 
extra time on exams and extensions 
for assignments, but one of the most 
helpful accommodations was highly 
specific: an automatic door opener acti­
vated by simply swiping her I.D. at any 
door on campus. 
“People didn’t even know that was a 
thing until they saw me do it with my 
I.D.,” Khan remembers. The technol­
ogy was “a game changer” for her, “an 
unexpected accommodation that really 
helped my life.” 


that a technology so obscure has 
such a profound impact on Khan’s life 
speaks to difficulties of finding connec­
tions across such a varied identity. Rose 
Bender, a current Yale medical student 
who graduated from the College in 2020, 
came to Yale and immediately faced this 
problem, struggling to find others who 
shared her experience. The first connec­
tion she made was by coincidence.
“Through one of my extracurricu­
lars, totally unrelated to disability, I met 
somebody who happened to have the 
same chronic illness as I did,” Bender 
said. “We became very good friends, and 
decided we wanted to start a group for 
students with disabilities.” 
That group, Disability Empowerment 
for Yale (DEFY), was founded in 2017 as 
Yale’s first student-run advocacy orga­
nization dedicated to disability. DEFY 
marked the first organized effort by dis­
abled students to create their own sup­
port system, independent of University 
structures. Their goal was not to usurp or 
replace SAS but rather to provide some­
thing that SAS could not: a group that 
focused on disabled students’ experi­
ences themselves rather than on provid­
ing purely institutional solutions to their 
challenges.
Having a single banner for stu­
dents to organize under proved effective. 
DEFY was instrumental in creating the 
American Sign Language program at 
Yale and in crafting Yale’s new policy on 
accessible course materials and websites. 
Their most well-known achievement, 
however, has been the institutionaliza­
tion of two academic mentorship pro­
grams: the Disability Peer Liaisons and 
the Disability Peer Mentors.
“When I got to Yale, other groups 
had Peer Liaisons that are run through 
the colleges and set up as soon as you 


get here,” Bender recalled. “I thought, 
why is there nothing like that for stu­
dents with disabilities?”
Bender’s friendship with someone 
who shared her experience showed the 
advantages of the comprehensive, holis­
tic mentorship offered by Peer Liaisons 
at Yale’s established cultural houses. 
She wanted to ensure that this kind of 
support wasn’t left to chance. Bender 
started an informal Peer Liaisons group 
within DEFY, creating an email list and 
handing out flyers around campus. The 
first year they had “maybe four or five 
mentees,” Bender says. The program 
grew to fifteen the next year, and DEFY 
petitioned for its institutionalization 
while continuing to work as an inde­
pendent advocacy organization.
They took the informal program to 
the two offices most likely to accept it: 
SAS and the Poorvu Center for Teaching 
and Learning. To DEFY’s surprise, both 
offices agreed to host the program, and 
it was split in two: the Disability Peer 
Liaisons, which would fall under the 
auspices of SAS, and the Disability Peer 
Mentors Program, overseen by the 
Poorvu Center.
Last 
year, 
the 
Disability 
Peer 
Mentors came under the direction of the 
Office of Educational Opportunity (OEO). 
Now, while the Disability Peer Liaisons 
continue to resemble other holistic Peer 
Liaison programs on campus (activi­
ties include taking mentees out for food, 
check-ins, and advising on life at Yale in 
general), the Disability Peer Mentors are 
now trained only in academic mentoring, 
a move made by the Poorvu administra­
tion which, according to Bender, altered 
the goals of the program fundamentally: 
“It’s not being true to the spirit of the pro­
gram,” Bender says of the Disability Peer 
Mentors’ new role under the OEO. “Putting 
it under that umbrella and that group, and 
taking away our unique training and com­
munity aspects, there’s a lot lost.” 
While the Disability Peer Liaisons 
still exist in their originally intended 
form, they are only available to under­
graduate students who are registered 
through SAS—unlike the Peer Mentors. 
For those unregistered, the path to 
holistic mentorship is not clear, if it 
exists at all. 
With increased visibility, resources, 
and organization, institutionalization 
brings the risk of moving student-
centered programs like Disability Peer 
Mentors toward another service-based 
model.


when I arrived on campus this fall, I 
was overwhelmed not only by the sheer 
number of resources sent to me as soon 
as I had scheduled a meeting with SAS, 
but also that these resources came from 
Yale’s administrative offices, and framed 
what was provided in terms of “support” 
rather than “community.” In the same 
string of emails from SAS, I learned how 
to schedule a meeting with an assistive 
technology expert and be paired with a 
Peer Liaison. 
As it stands, the physical, communal 
space for disability at Yale is The Good 
Life Center at SAS, a room within the SAS 
office and an offshoot of the larger series 
of campus relaxation spaces under the 
“Good Life” banner. Improvised from 
the skeleton of administrative suites 
surrounding it, the Good Life Center is 
an island of color and comfort between 
SAS’s white walls. Sunlight streams down 
through skylights. Accessible seating of 
varying heights and styles surrounds a 
central table, where lichens creep over 
the sides of a planter. A shelf holds cof­
fee and tea.
But according to Sovy Pham, a 
junior who works as a Peer Liaison at 
SAS, events hosted there usually have 
low attendance—a challenge the Peer 
Liaison program itself shares. 
“The number of students who receive 
accommodations versus the number of 
students who request a Peer Liaison, it’s 


drastically different,” Pham tells me. 
Pham’s initial experience with 
formal accommodations, like Khan’s, 
began at Yale. With a diagnosis, Pham 
says she can explain her situation more 
easily to professors: “My ability or 
inability to complete certain assign­
ments. There’s a reason for it, for the 
way that my brain functions differently 
than other people’s.” 
“There’s this split stream at Yale,” 
Khan observes. “A lot of these accommo­
dations are actually super common. It’s 
not just people who identify as disabled. 
People get accommodations who don’t 
spend as much time thinking about dis­
ability and what it means to be disabled 
and have a disabled body.” 
Translating such a subjective and 
personal experience into a shared iden­
tity and, beyond that, into a community, 
is a difficult task. The close relationship 
between disability and the medical and 
legal mandates of student support, spe­
cifically student confidentiality and 
evidence-based approval for accommo­
dations, can make connecting with others 
who share the experience more difficult. 
“With SAS, students don’t have to 
tell anyone that they have a disability, and 
that’s everyone’s choice. This is not to say 
that SAS is opaque on purpose, but stu­
dents are empowered to make that choice,” 
Pham notes. Disability, because it is often 
defined in terms of an individual’s capacity 
rather than their outward appearance, can 
also be literally invisible, regardless of the 
rules in place to ensure privacy.
This invisibility bleeds over into 
support and advocacy spaces as well. As 
a Peer Liaison, Pham says she doesn’t 
know anyone who is a Peer Mentor, 
despite the fact that those programs 
were once one and the same. She also 
advocates for causes related to disability 
as a member of the Yale College Council, 
including an effort to create a disability 
cultural house at Yale, but does so mostly 
independently of DEFY.
“I think disability is unique as an 
identity because it necessitates institu­
tions, because it is the institution that 
determines your ability to some extent,” 
Pham muses. “Institutions create the 
parameters for how disabilities manifest.”
Pham offers an example: “I’m Asian, 
right? If I go to the AACC, or if I don’t go 
to the AACC, I’m still gonna be Asian at 
the end of the day. My relationship to my 
identity does not have to be necessarily 
tethered to an institution.” 


writing this article has been the 
only time, at Yale or anywhere else, when 
I’ve talked to others about the experience 
of disability in a sustained, non-trivial 
way. These conversations have helped 
me see how others engage with disabil­
ity: not as a barrier to be triumphed over, 
but as a way of living. At the most basic 
level, forming a community around dis­
ability would require defining “disabil­
ity” outside of a particular institutional 
transaction.
For those who want to have these 
conversations and bridge the divide 
between statistical debates over accommo­
dations and how students actually 
experience them, there is no single path 
forward. DEFY and other advocates on 
campus have called for the creation of a 
Persons with Disabilities Cultural Center 
since 2019, but with low attendance at 
existing events on campus, it’s unclear if 
a designated physical space is the larg­
est barrier to creating a community. To 
move forward, we need to acknowledge 
that the difficulties in creating a commu­
nity around disabilities may stem from 
the very institutional measures intended 
to support them. ∎
