Tacey Hutten ‘26 was asleep inside a tent on 
Beinecke Plaza at 6 a.m. on April 22, when 
her friend shook her awake to inform her 
that police officers were outside the encampment. 
Hutten and other protesters had anticipated that 
they would be arrested, but not that the police 
would show up this early in the morning. For 
three days, Hutten, among hundreds of other stu­
dents, had been occupying the plaza, protesting 
the university’s investments in weapons manu­
facturing amid Israel’s ongoing bombardment of 
Gaza, which has killed over forty thousand people. 
They had contended with threats of arrest from the 
Yale Police Department for three nights, refusing 
administrators’ orders to disperse their encamp­
ment of over two dozen tents, where they had 
hosted teach-ins, artwork displays, student group 
performances, and mutual aid support. On the 
previous day, the university offered the protesters 
a final deal: in exchange for dispersing, organizers 
would be granted a meeting with two trustees of 
the Yale Corporation, which makes final determi­
nations regarding university investments. The pro­
testers turned it down.

Hundreds of students gathered around the 
encampment the night of April 21, linking arms to 
form a protective ring. A hundred voices chorused 
into one. Just like a tree that’s planted by the water, 
they sang, we shall not be moved. 

Police waited until dawn the next day to 
announce their final dispersal warning.

As the YPD officers closed in, over fifty dem­
onstrators awoke and assumed the same protec­
tive stance, again linking arms as they circled the 
Beinecke flagpole. As the demonstrators sang the 
protest spiritual “We Shall not be Moved,” offi­
cers arrested students in rounds, picking out a few 
protesters at a time as others waited to be taken. 
Protester Kai Padilla-Smith ’25 described how 
students were made to wait shivering for over an 
hour as the tents were ripped down behind them. 
“​It was very clearly part of the university’s con­
tinued psychological pressure on student activists. 
Why are you showing up at six in the morning 
when we were all up until three rallying to keep 
you away?” Hutten said. “That is where this univer­
sity’s resources go into—the policing and criminal­
ization of its own students—as well as the funding 
of bombs and missiles and tanks that are just deci­
mating Gaza.”

Hutten didn’t resist when police officers zip-
tied her wrists, shouldering her and forty-seven 
other arrestees, at least forty-four of whom were 
students, 
through 
the 
Schwarzman 
Center. 
Spectators and supporters heckled the officers 
and cheered for the protesters as they were loaded 
into Yale buses. The buses shook from the arrestees 
stomping, singing, and cheering pro-Palestine slo­
gans inside. All of the arrestees were charged with 
criminal misdemeanors for trespassing. 

When justifying the arrests, the University 
pointed to protesters’ refusal to disperse and 
claimed that the demonstrations blocked paths to 
the Schwarzman Center.

“Prior to their removal from the plaza, the 
university spent several hours in discussions with 
student protestors, offering them opportunities to 
meet with trustees, and to avoid arrest if they left 
the plaza by the end of that weekend,” a university 
spokesperson wrote to me. 

Following the arrests, the Sumud Coalition—
formerly known as Occupy Beinecke, the coalition 
of student groups that organized the protests—
has campaigned for Yale to drop the charges via 
social media and online petitions that have gar­
nered thousands of signatures. While Yale cannot 
directly revoke the charges pressed by the state 
of Connecticut, it does have the power to ask the
