Points of Departure
Out of the Frame
At the YUAG, the Department of Prints and 
Drawings sketches out an alternative mode 
of museum-going.
A
large wooden door on the 
fourth floor of the Yale University 
Art Gallery guards a room that looks 
off-limits. But small white print on the 
wood reads, “OPEN BY APPOINTMENT.” 
Behind lies a collection of more than 
fifty thousand prints, drawings, and pho­
tographs—the hidden treasures of the 
Department of Prints and Drawings.

Most YUAG curators work outside 
of the three-building museum, but 
Prints and Drawings is one of three 
curatorial departments housed within 
the Gallery. It operates out of a study 
room adjacent to its exhibition space 
on the fourth floor.

Most of the YUAG’s works on paper 
collection are prints. They are created 
by etching or carving an image onto a 
matrix—a template often made of wood 
or metal. The matrix is inked, and the 
inked image is transferred onto another 
surface, often paper or fabric, which 
becomes the artwork. Because the pro­
cess is defined by transfer from a template, 
printmaking facilitates reproducibility. 
For this reason, prints and drawings cura­
tor Freyda Spira told me, works on paper 
are seen as “democratic media.”

“Because they’re multiple, many cop­
ies can be distributed around the world 
and disseminate knowledge,” curator 
Lisa Hodermarsky explained.

What happens when works on paper, 
valued for their accessibility, become 
tucked away in a museum?

***
On an october afternoon, Freyda 
Spira, the Robert L. Solley Curator of 
Prints and Drawings, met me in the 
lobby of the Yale University Art Gallery. 
Together, we took the West Elevator to 
the fourth floor. 

The department was founded in 
1927, ninety-five years after the YUAG. 
Previously, the museum had been mostly 
a paintings collection, and according to 
Hodermarsky, there were only a “small 
smattering of drawings.” In 1925, the 
Gallery was gifted 150 prints by Albrecht 
Dürer and Rembrandt van Rijn, a col­
lection significant enough to start the 
department and study room.

With Spira, I entered the James 
E. Duffy Study Room, where a large 
wooden table stood at the center. Natural 
light flooded in through the floor-to-
ceiling windows, illuminating the prints 
lined neatly along the table’s perimeter. 
Towards the back of the room, offices with 
big glass windows provided a glimpse 
of the curators behind the scenes. I saw 
Lisa Hodermarsky, the Sutphin Family 
Curator of Prints and Drawings, focused 
at her desk, but as soon as I came into the 
room, she greeted me brightly. “I like your 
sweater,” she said. “Very collegiate!”

As the two curators showed me 
through the different spaces, they seam­
lessly bounced sentences back and forth 
between each other.

Spira started: “This is where we do….”

“The magic here!” Hodermarsky finished.

The curators opened several cabinets 
and drawers, sharing fun facts about each 
piece. Works on paper can stand alone 
as complete works, but the collection 
also includes many preparatory works of 
paintings displayed in the Gallery. For 
Hodermarsky, seeing the artist’s process is 
the exciting part. In the late 19th century, 
she explained, the artist of a mural would 
often do the preparatory sketch, but the 
painting was usually done by assistants. 
“The preparatory works are what have the 
artist’s hand,” Hodermarsky said.


Classes often visit the study room, 
where students can experience an alter­
native mode of museum-going. Yale 
English lecturer Margaret Spillane, who 
teaches “Writing about Contemporary 
Figurative Art,” brings her students here 
twice a semester. Students, Spillane said, 
are often surprised by the intimacy of 
experiencing the art at such proximity.

“There’s no glass, there’s no frame,” 
she said. “It’s a completely different 
experience when there’s nothing mediat­
ing the space between you and the work.”


Through the study room, works on 
paper are accessible to students in a way 
that off-site paintings and sculptures are 
not. Yet Joseph Henry, a fellow in the 
Prints and Drawings department who 
facilitates class visits, noted that the rad­
ical reproducibility and traversability of 
prints is perhaps oversold. “They’re not

cycle in and out of storage. Sometimes, 
the selections provide unexpected inspi­
ration for rotations: earlier this fall, two 
Dante portfolios were pulled for an 
Italian literature course. The curators 
are now considering the portfolios for a 
future rotation about light and darkness.

Spira said that class selections are 
just one example of the many “rab­
bit holes” through which Spira and 
Hodermarsky find inspiration. Spira said 
the collection is like a library, to which 
Hodermarsky immediately added: “The 
book you think you want is not the one 
you want. It’s the next thing.” 

Spira and Hodermarsky might 
start the curation process by browsing 
virtual documents that travel,” he told 
me, as he handled the prints. “They have 
a real materiality to them.” To be viewed 
by a visitor, each work must be individ­
ually unearthed from storage and moni­
tored by the staff.

The department has long serviced 
visitors through their study room, but 
it was only in 2022 that the department 
received a dedicated gallery space. YUAG 
Chief Curator Laurence Kanter said 
that the Gallery had always wanted one 
for the Prints and Drawings department, 
and the COVID-19 pandemic provided 
the opportunity to convert part of the 
temporary exhibition spaces for prints, 
drawings, and photography rotations.

Yet the department still cannot dis­
play a permanent installation. Because 
light exposure may cause fading and 
color shift in paper, the prints and draw­
ings gallery is changed out every six 
months. Compared to curators at other 
departments, who host mostly perma­
nent installations or special exhibitions 
planned several years in advance, cura­
tors in the Prints and Drawings depart­
ment put together rotations at a tempo 
Henry described as “a little aggressive.” 

Curating rotations, along with servicing 
visitors in their study room, keeps the 
small department busy.

With a diversity of visitors and inter­
ests to accommodate, different works

through an online database. But having 
the collection at their fingertips enables 
another level of interactivity—the cura­
tors can actually pull works out, see how 
they look in real life, and examine how 
objects look next to each other on the 
big table.

“I think we’re like kids in a candy 
store, and we have a really rich collec­
tion, and so it’s hard not to get excited,” 
Spira said.

When I first visited the small 
department, I was struck by its quiet 
hyperactivity. Now I can see that this 
hyperactivity ensures these works on 
paper have visibility. And visibility is 
crucial for works on paper—they were 
always meant to be seen.

Though these works of art may now 
be tucked away in a museum, it is the 
Prints and Drawings staff who keep the 
spirit of accessibility alive. They facilitate 
the movement of the thousands of prints 
and drawings that lie in storage—prevent­
ing them from collecting dust, and bring­
ing them to the public. With each rotation, 
a new set of works takes on renewed life.

What’s on display in the prints and 
drawings gallery is only a glimpse. Just 
one wall away, tens of thousands of hid­
den prints brim with possibility. ∎
