Black community. With the advent of 
sound recording, it spread rapidly across 
the South in the 1920s and 1930s.

During World War I, industry and 
job market growth along the Eastern 
seaboard sparked a large wave of Black 
immigration from the American South 
to the Dixwell and Oak Street neigh­
borhoods of New Haven. With the 
Great Migration, the jazz music tradi­
tion moved North, settling along the 
Eastern coastline in industrial hubs like 
New Haven.

Many new city dwellers found work 
at the local New Haven arms manu­
facturer, Winchester Repeating Arms 
Company. Amidst this revitalized indus­
trial landscape, jazz clubs began popping 
up across New Haven, serving as an out­
let for finding community and letting 
loose after a long day’s work. 

New Haven’s first club, The Monterey, 
opened its doors in 1936. Many others 
soon followed: Dinkie’s, Golden Gate, 
The Playback, The Recorder, The Foundry 
Cafe, The Democratic Club, and the 
Musicians’ Club. Most were located 
along Dixwell Avenue in historic down­
town New Haven. From the beginning, 
jazz in the city was collaborative, fueled 
by an appreciation for the shared physical 
space of Dixwell Avenue and the com­
munity-orientation inherent to the genre.

Eventually, both local and national 
names would come to consider Elm 
City their stage. Alongside artists like 
John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, and Duke 
Ellington—who would often stop to per­
form in New Haven between Boston and 
New York while on tour—local artists, like 
the Buster Brothers, Reginald Jackson, 
and Allen “Rubbs” Wilson, fueled and fed 
the jazz scene in New Haven.

Yet by the 1990s, this scene was 
growing smaller. Throughout the 1980s, 
the majority of the clubs along Dixwell 
had shut their doors due to bankruptcy, 
as well as a series of drug-related busts at 
clubs like the Foundry Cafe. Many New 
Haven musicians began moving to New 
York in search of greater opportunities. 

Today, Dixwell Avenue looks dif­
ferent. Former clubs are boarded up; 
“For Sale” signs populate the street.

heart and soul of New Haven jazz, the

’m right in the swing of things.
Literally—in the swing of it all. 
The ups and downs of the melodies, 
the croon of the trumpet, the thrum of 
the bass, and the echoes of the drums. It’s 
a Tuesday night, but New Haven’s Cafe 
Nine is alive. Flanked by posters adver­
tising Coca-Cola products and maps of 
the city’s historic downtown, local gui­
tarist Ed Cherry is soulfully strumming 
on the stage, playing a slow rendition of 
“Peace” by Horace Silver. He’s flanked 
by his ensemble: together, they form a 
trio of the bass, the drums, and Cherry 
on the strings. His eyes are closed. The 
crowd in front of him is enraptured. The 
room is silent, save for the music.

Tonight is one of Cafe Nine’s sig­
nature jazz shows, held in partnership 
with the New Haven Jazz Underground. 
Located on State Street, Cafe Nine hosts 
live music shows seven days a week with 
the goal of supporting emerging artists 
in the greater New Haven area. Twice 
per month, on Tuesday nights, local jazz 
musicians take the stage at the 34-year-
old venue.

Here—alongside other local bars like 
The Cannon and Three Sheets—the spirit 
and collaborative energy that have defined 
New Haven’s jazz music scene since the 
turn of the 20th century remain alive.

New Haven has always been a jazz city. 
Born out of the New Orleans swing and 
blues scene, jazz was originally a mech­
anism of expression for New Orleans’
