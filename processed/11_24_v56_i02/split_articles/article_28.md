the feeling that you have this tiny bunk 
bed you share with someone: that’s how 
school feels like. And then homeschool 
is this giant queen bed,” said Elisabeth, 
widening her arms to gesture at the 
immense freedom.

Today, LeBlanc feels very strongly 
about schooling: “The public school sys­
tem only works for a very small percent­
age of children.” Whether in special-ed 
or gifted programs, schools leave behind 
the kids stuck on the periphery of their 
arbitrary “normal.” 

Jenn Massameno of Wallingford, 
who homeschools her two teenage 
sons, Sam and Max, credits this failure 
partially to the Common Core State 
Standards Initiative, which began in 
2010 to increase consistency in K-12 
ELA and math education throughout 
the United States. The initiative began 
with a simple idea: to create one set of 
academic expectations for all students, 
ensuring identical and consistent lev­
els of achievement for all. Common 
Core provides outlines and descriptions 
of skills students should have at each 
grade level. Its top-down, standardized 
approach, however, limits a teacher’s 
ability to adapt to student needs and 
leaves many at a loss. 

“[Common Core] was saying that 
we’re just going to teach in the middle. 
The kids who are lower? They’re going 
to get the extra help. The kids that are 
higher? Too bad for them,” explained 
Massameno.

Massameno, a former public school 
special-ed teacher, suspected from a 
young age that Sam had dyslexia and 
her younger son, Max, had ADHD. Public 
schools offer free support for such 
special needs. Yet, after observing the 
under-resourced and overstrained spe­
cial-ed services in Wallingford Public 
Schools, Massameno opted for home­
schooling. “There was no way that I 
would ever send my kid to that school.”

According to a 2023 U.S. State 
Department 
of 
Education 
report, 
Connecticut sends 6.3 percent of its 
students out of district schools into 
specialized programs for children with 
disabilities, the most of any state. While 
specialized schools certainly can help 
students with accommodations succeed, 
the high outplacement rate may also 
demonstrate school districts’ inability to 
adequately support special-ed students 
in integrated school settings. 

“It was just really disheartening,” 
said Massameno.

III. 
F
or  Many FamilIES,  homeschool­
ing goes beyond its lexicon—“home” 
and “school.” From building original 
curriculums to seeking outside activi­
ties, parents often find themselves doing 
far more than moving a public school 
structure into a private household.

Massameno explains that one of 
the most challenging aspects of homes­
chooling is finances. “There’s no way that 
we would be able to do this if we could 
not live on the one income that my hus­
band makes,” Massameno explains. 
When Massameno and her husband 
were married, Massameno chose to stay 
home with the kids, resulting in a series 
of financial decisions that enabled her 
family to homeschool: they purchased a 
smaller house, which they could afford 
on one salary; they drove used cars until 
the cars died. 

Chione Giacomarro, who home­
schools her two children, Kamy and 
Caden, recognizes the inherent privilege 
of being able to homeschool. Most fami­
lies can only choose it, she says, “because 
they have the resources to be able to 
accommodate that.”

Homeschooling 
gets 
expensive. 
Many aspects of the vibrant practice—
extracurricular sports, art activities, fre­
quent museum trips—come with a price. 
Membership for homeschooling co-op 
groups, where families come together 
once or twice weekly to offer enrich­
ment activities and community, can also 
be costly. Durbin’s friend who homes­
chools in Oklahoma receives a state tax 
write-off for homeschooling her kids. 
Connecticut, however, does not and 
cannot provide this benefit, as it does 
not keep track of its homeschoolers.

In many homeschooling families, at 
least one parent will have to fully take 
on the role of a teacher, dropping a full 
income, or, in Werth’s case, working 
part-time outside of regular homeschool 
schedules. More often than not, the 
majority of homeschooling work falls 
to mothers, who make up 82 percent of 
stay-at-home parents in the U.S. 

IV. 
C
oNNECTICUT  ATTEMPTED  to pass 
a bill increasing homeschooling 
oversight in 2019. It failed after elicit­
ing protests from homeschooling advo­
cates like Connors and Stevenson. The 
proposed legislature first arose after 
Matthew Tirado, a non-verbal autis­
tic teen, died in early 2017 after suffer­
ing abuse and neglect at the hands of 
his mother. Tirado and his sister had 
been out of school for months before 
his death. Hartford Public Schools, 
Tirado’s district, had filed reports 
to the Department of Children and 
Families alleging potential abuse in the 
household, but no response took hold. 
Ostensibly, Tirado was just homes­
chooled, and lawfully so. 

Later that year, Sarah Eagan, 
Connecticut’s acting Child Advocate, 
argued for improved protection for 
Connecticut’s homeschooled children in 
a report. “There must be a safety net to 
protect children who are victims of abuse 
and neglect from being withdrawn from 
the safe harbor and visibility of school 
and removed to a less or even poten­
tially non-visible environment,” Eagan 
wrote. She proposed that parents “apply” 
to homeschool their children, reviewing 
a student’s truancy and absence records 
and reporting any concerns of abuse or 
neglect to the DCF ahead of time.

“In a public school, if children are 
absent, they will send truancy officers to 
the home, and there is a point where they 
will get the Department of Children and 
Families involved if a child is truant,” 
said Mary Gunsalus, Lecturer at the Yale 
Child Study Center and head of Child 
Study Center School. “But how is that 
regulated in a homeschooling environ­
ment?” she asks.

It 
isn’t. 
Connecticut 
General 
Statute §10-184 explicitly requires chil­
dren under the age of eighteen to regu­
larly attend a public school, unless “the 
person having control of such child is 
able to show that the child is elsewhere 
receiving equivalent instruction in the 
studies taught in the public schools.” 
Without 
governmental 
supervision, 
however, no one can be one hundred 
percent certain of the “equivalency” of 
instruction in a home. 

NHPS explicitly states that the dis­
trict does not provide “any support in 
educating the child” once they give 
up their seat in school. This means no 
access to free coursework, technology, 
special-ed programs, nor mental health 
and counseling services that all public 
schools mandate. For low-income fami­
lies, it also means losing access to subsi­
dized meals and after-school care.

But for many homeschooling fami­
lies, the purpose of homeschooling is to 
provide an educational experience not 
equivalent to that of public schools.

Many homeschooling parents make 
the case that truants are not homes­
chooled, as they are not being educated. 
They argue that abuse and neglect, too, 
are problems separate from at-home 
education that need to be addressed 
without infringing upon the constitu­
tional rights of homeschooling parents. 
According to Connors, many homes­
choolers left traditional schools to escape 
purported bullying, physical abuse, and 
threats of violence against students. In 
her daughter Sophia Connors’ opposi­
tion to Connecticut’s 2019 bill, she asked 
lawmakers to “leave homeschoolers 
alone and to take care of the real prob­
lems that they have yet to fix.” 

For 
Attorney 
Stevenson, 
who 
founded NHELD, the battle against 
increased 
homeschooling 
oversight 
hinges on preserving parental rights to 
direct their child’s education from state 
interference. “Did we, the people … 
grant to the government the right or the 
power to grant or take away our inalien­
able rights in the manner they propose to 
do so? Then the conversation, as a matter 
of law, must end there,” said Stevenson.

Some homeschooling families in 
Connecticut say they find the state’s 
lack of oversight crucial to their practice. 
LeBlanc finds the minimal requirements 
to be “nice,” as it enables her full freedom 
in her children’s education. Werth and 
her husband chose homeschooling partly 
because they wanted to detach learning 
from the rigid standardization of testing. 
Homeschooling is not an “anti-pub­
lic school” agenda, said Connors. “It is the 
idea of facing the truth of where the pub­
lic schools are at, and not being willing 
to give the schools the time to fix their 
issues. Your child gets one childhood and 
it isn’t to be used as [the school’s] experi­
ment, because it’s clearly failing.”

A
MELIA  DILWORTH ’23  was home­
schooled from preschool through 
ninth grade. Dilworth grew up in a 
group, 
where 
par­
ents brought their kids of similar age 
together twice a week, taking turns 
teaching different subjects. Through it, 
Dilworth experienced not only what 
it feels like to belong in a community, 
but also how to construct one from the 
ground up. “You’re in an environment 
everyone kind of comes together to 
build, right? So, it’s much more than 
just going to that empty shell of a 
school building, and saying bye at the 
end of the day.” 

Dilworth reflected that as a young 
child, watching her homeschooling 
community grow also meant witnessing 
a group of women—her and her fellow 
homeschoolers’ moms—take agency and 
create a community filled with learning 
and flourishing. “I think that was really 
good and healthy for my idea of what 
women can do,” she explained. “Together, 
we decide what we’re doing, not some 
unknown group telling us what we’re 
doing. We, as a collective, make choices.” 

But the freedom that homes­
chooled families receive also presents 
its uncertainties. 

When asked about what she 
envisions for Sam and Max’s futures, 
Massameno smiled and responded: 
“You’ve hit my weak spot.” She knows, 
however, that her number one priority 
is for her sons to be happy. “That is the 
goal. How they get there? I just—I want 
to help them get there, and I don’t know 
the best way,” she explained, adding, “and 
I’m not good with uncertainty.”

LeBlanc hopes to seek out new 
STEM resources for Elisabeth. After her 
previous homeschooling group disinte­
grated, she wants to find a new group 
for Elisabeth. She may even consider 
founding one herself. ∎
