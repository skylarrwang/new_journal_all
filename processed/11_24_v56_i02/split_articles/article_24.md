Arresting One’s Own
a no-contest plea in which infractions would be 
dropped in no sooner than thirteen months given no 
further legal troubles.
“With one stroke of a pen, [prosecutors] got rid 
of all those cases,” former anti-apartheid protester 
Doug Carver ’88 said. In contrast, he pointed to the 
unusually protracted legal process for the pro-divest­
ment protesters arrested last spring. “Seven months, 
that takes you from one school year to the next, one 
academic year to the next. There was definitely noth­
ing like that.”
Pro-Palestine protesters not only contended 
with a longer legal process than anti-apartheid 
protesters, but also tighter restrictions from admin­
istrators. While former university president Bart 
Giamatti told students they could build shanties 
elsewhere on campus, negotiations over the poten­
tial reinstatement of last spring’s encampments 
have never occurred. Instead, Yale adopted guide­
lines that outright banned unregistered student 
groups like the Sumud Coalition from hosting 
outdoor gatherings, though daytime demonstra­
tions and teach-ins have continued this semester. 
The anti-apartheid shanties stayed for another two 
years with sanction after their inception, only com­
ing down in the summer of 1988 when a disgrun­
tled alum set them ablaze.
Coleman, who had protested apartheid, said 
she felt that despite administrators’ “shockingly 
brittle” initial response of multiple rounds of arrest, 
they respected the practice and history of nonvio­
lent protest. Countryman agreed that he did not feel 
personal hostility toward students from University 
Secretary John Wilkinson ’60, the administrator in 
charge of addressing student protests. 
“I thought we had a very positive relationship, 
and it didn’t change when we did get arrested. In 
that sense, [Wilkinson] didn’t get angry with us. His 
commitment to maintaining dialogue and negotia­
tion very much remained in place,” Countryman said. 
Their relationship later grew into a friendship with 
Wilkinson that persists in the present; the former 
administrator attended Countryman’s wedding years 
after his graduation.
Meanwhile, current Yale protesters have felt 
that administrators openly express animosity toward 
them. Hutten pointed to a faculty-wide email that 
Yale College Dean of Students Pericles Lewis sent 
shortly after the arrests, in which he characterized 
protests as increasingly dangerous due to “non-Yale 
protesters with a known history of violent confron­
tation with the police.” He urged faculty to ask that 
students stop associating with them. In a statement 
to the Yale Daily News, Lewis later apologized for 
insinuating that the protests would become violent 
without evidence and said he erred in repeating mere 
speculation. 


“It has been made very clear to us that this 
campus isn’t for us,” Hutten said, “and that we are 
believed to be the people who are making this cam­
pus unsafe.” 
Eroding Trust
The breakdown of trust and communication 
between protesters last semester stands out in the 
history of student protests at Yale. 
Arrests during peaceful demonstrations were 
rare under the tenure of former university president 
Kingman Brewster, who sometimes spoke out on 
high-profile political issues and even participated in 
some protests against the Vietnam War during his 
presidency. In 1970, when several prominent mem­
bers of the Black Panther Party were charged with 
murder in New Haven and student activists gathered 
in hundreds to protest, Brewster criticized police for 
inflaming racial tensions. For a “May Day” demon­
stration on the New Haven Green against the trial, 
Brewster coordinated with student activists, residen­
tial college staff, and faculty to open up the residen­
tial colleges and dining halls for thousands of outside 
protesters.
Richard Levin, who served as university presi­
dent from 1993 to 2013, told me he had a personal 
distaste for responding to student protests with 
arrests. Police involvement only occurred under uni­
versity orders in cases where students occupied the 
inside of buildings overnight. Other protest-related 
arrests, often related to pro-labor activism, occurred 
primarily at the hands of New Haven police for 
demonstrations that blocked city streets. 
“Remembering that demonstrators are our stu­
dents is one important facet. And drawing clear lines 
about what is permissible expression and what isn’t 
is another,” Levin said. “It’s only when their right to 
express their opinions is disruptive and prevents oth­
ers from using university facilities or from going to 
class, or expressing their views, that it’s a problem.”
In the early 2000s, the undergraduate organiza­
tion Students Against Sweatshops protested in sup­
port of Yale joining the Workers’ Rights Consortium, 
a monitoring organization for overseas factories. 
Levin disagreed with their demands, but he dis­
cussed students’ concerns during their demonstra­
tions on Beinecke Plaza, even hosting a teach-in on 
labor conditions and international markets. When 
Students Against Sweatshops set up their own 
overnight encampments on Beinecke Plaza, Levin 
said he never felt the need to involve police, as the 
encampment didn’t block the flow of traffic or dis­
rupt daily life on campus. Police officers were present, 
but from a distance and inside their cars. According 
to Abigail Balbale ’04, a former Students Against 
Sweatshops protester, they only approached period­
ically to warn protesters about the rain or to recom­
mend they eat and stay warm.
“In retrospect, he was treating us like adults who 
he can have a conversation with, and that was treat­
ing us with a certain level of respect that I feel is less 
common in the world today,” said Balbale, who is 
now a professor at New York University. “So many 
universities, including Yale and NYU, have doubled 
down on their representation of the protests as vio­
lent and dangerous in a way that further undermines 
that trust.”

A Dangerous Precedent
today, countryman is a bespectacled faculty 
member at the University of Michigan, where he 
is the chair of the African American and African 
Studies department. As a former student protester 
and now-educator, he believes that arrests only 
worsen campus environments, universities’ reputa­
tions, and students’ overall well-being.
“I could see that there were lessons learned from 
the experience in the anti-apartheid movement, and 
the university seemed to be applying those to grap­
ple with students around issues, whether it’s pro-la­
bor protests, or the climate protests, or whatever else,” 
Countryman said. “So it’s striking that they have 
abandoned that—they’ve gone back to arrests.”
The act of deploying police to respond to non­
violent student activities sets a dangerous precedent, 
Greta LaFleur argued.
“I don’t think it is in any way ever safe to bring 
law enforcement onto college campuses as a means of 
enforcing college policy 
ever,” LaFleur said. “And 
there’s a really clear exam­
ple of why you shouldn’t 
do that, and that example 
is Kent State.”
On May 4, 1970, four 
students 
attending 
a 
largely peaceful protest 
against the Vietnam War 
at Kent State University 
in Kent, Ohio were shot 
to death by members of 
the state’s National Guard. 
The university had called 
in the National Guard 
after a series of rowdy 
demonstrations 
around 
campus earlier in the 
week. Nine other students 
were injured, including 
one person who became 
paralyzed for life.
The Kent State exam­
ple represents an extreme, 
but the potential for any 
degree of violence when 
calling in law enforcement 
cannot be dismissed. At 
multiple other universi­
ties, the police presence at 
recent pro-Palestine pro­
tests has endangered cur­
rent students, with police 
beating and pepper spray­
ing protesters and student 
journalists. At Columbia 
University, 
an 
officer’s 
gun fired unintentionally 
during an interaction with 
student protesters. 

     According to meeting minutes from a faculty 
senate meeting held three days after the April 22 
arrests on Beinecke Plaza, Dean Lewis told fac­
ulty he had lost his control and authority over the 
situation on Saturday evening, when two count­
er-protesters entered heated confrontations with 
protesters after attempting to film them. Police 
were a necessary response to escalating tension, 
Lewis said. But some faculty members pointed 
out that the arrival of police officers themselves 
to a nonviolent protest caused the escalation and a 
feeling of inevitable conflict.
“In fifty years, [Yale] will celebrate us for being 
activists and standing up for what we believe in… 
the same ways they celebrate the anti-apartheid 
movement,” Padilla-Smith told me. “But in the 
moment, we’re criminalized, excluded from meet­
ings, basically rushed out of the university as fast 
as we can be.”
Yale has taken steps to address the arrests of 
the spring, allowing students to meet with one 
trustee. The university has also changed its guide­
lines around free expression to restrict outdoor 
and overnight gatherings, chalk use, and postering. 
Yale has hired “free expression facilitators,” who a 
university spokesperson said are responsible for 
“supporting speaker events, rallies, vigils, gather­
ings, protests, and counterprotests.” This semester, 
the free expression facilitators have stood to the 
side and observed demonstrations and teach-ins 
on Cross Campus and Beinecke Plaza, some of 
which Yale agreed to sanction.
Yet many of the students arrested last fall 
continue to feel cast aside. When the Sumud 
Coalition was granted a meeting with one trustee 
in September, the Yale Corporation denied all of 
the group’s initial terms for meeting—including 
allowing students who were arrested or facing 
disciplinary charges to attend—in an email to 
organizers.
Hutten and Padilla-Smith are still students 
at Yale, where they continue to be involved with 
teach-ins, campaigns, and rallies held by the 
Sumud Coalition. They said that their relation­
ship with the school has changed for the worse. 
“For student activists, how are you supposed 
to attend classes and build relationships with 
professors, and invest in this university when you 
also have cops on every corner?” Hutten asked. 
“And then walking to class, you see the cop who 
arrested you.”
Outside of activist work and academics, 
Hutten avoids spending more time on campus 
than she needs to. Her trust in the university to 
engage in productive conversation has eroded. ∎
