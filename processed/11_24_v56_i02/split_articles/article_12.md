Grocery Gap

in a food desert.
F 
orty-seven dollars. That’s all the 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program (SNAP) has given Cheryl Rabe 
to spend on a month’s worth of groceries. 
At Stop & Shop, Rabe must decide: 
strawberries are too expensive on their 
own, so she opts for the value container 
of mixed fruit; organic greens aren’t 
affordable and bagged salad will go bad 
too quickly, so she chooses a head of 
lettuce; alfredo sauce—which Rabe pre­
fers—is too expensive, so she settles for 
tomato sauce; soda isn’t ideal, but it’s 
only one dollar, so it goes in the cart.
“I’ve been learning to eat like that—
to not be picky,” Rabe says, looking 
downward at the cart. Today she wears 
an Obama T-shirt that reads “Have you 
missed me yet?”  
Rabe is a member of the New Haven 
chapter of Witnesses to Hunger, a group 
whose mission is to “identify, address, 
and create positive solutions to food 
insecurity.”
What distinguishes Witnesses to 
Hunger from similar food-focused advo­
cacy groups in New Haven is their mem­
bers—many of them, like Rabe, have 
personally lived with food insecurity.
As we pass through Stop & Shop’s 
aisles, Rabe maps out New Haven’s food 
insecurity for me. The city has a tremen­
dous lack of grocery options. This means 
that, according to the United States 
Department of Agriculture, parts of New 
Haven are classified as a food desert: an 
urban area where it is difficult to buy 
affordable or good-quality fresh food. 
As a result, 22 percent of New 
Haven residents are food insecure—
double the national average, as the 
Yale Hunger and Homelessness Action 
Project (YHHAP) states. 
Stop & Shop, located on Whalley 
Avenue, is the only full-service super­
market within walking distance from 
downtown New Haven, so price gouging 
is common. 
“Milk you can get for $2.50 at 
Walmart, they’ll charge you $4.50 at Stop 
& Shop,” Rabe says. 
Food insecurity, and price goug­
ing, have only grown since the pandemic. 
Before the pandemic, Rabe said she 
received 260 dollars from SNAP. After the 
pandemic, that number dropped to six­
ty-seven dollars, and then to forty-seven 
dollars because of her part-time job.
Qualifying for SNAP depends on 
how much money an individual and 
their household makes monthly. In 
Connecticut, someone living in a house­
hold of one making no more than 2,510 
dollars could receive up to 292 dollars 
in SNAP benefits. The sum is followed by 
an asterisk; track it to the bottom of the 
chart and it’s emphasized that this 292 
dollars is “the most SNAP benefits some­
one could get.”
In other words, people like Rabe will 
probably get less.

petition with Witnesses to Hunger ask­
ing Yale to “commit one hundred thou­
sand dollars per year to support existing 
free grocery programs at New Haven 
Public School locations that reach fami­
lies when New Haven public schools are 
not in session.”
Witnesses to Hunger has received 
half of their one hundred thousand dollar 
request. Twelve thousand dollars comes 
from the Yale’s Office of New Haven 
Affairs; the rest is from private donors.
Sitting together at Panera Bread, a 
couple of months after our grocery shop­
ping trip, Rabe and Griffin—decked out 
in white and blue, since the Yankees played 
this weekend—enthusiastically update me 
on Witnesses to Hunger’s advocacy efforts. 
They tell me that Witnesses to Hunger is 
going strong and that they aren’t stopping 
at fifty thousand dollars. Furthermore, 
they want the one hundred thousand dol­
lars to be an annual donation. 
Griffin says the fight is worth it, and 
that it “won’t go away overnight.”
On the third Saturday of each 
month, Witnesses to Hunger will meet 
in Wilson Library to discuss new ways 
to get the word out, educate the commu­
nity, acquire petition signatures, and plan 
future rallies. ∎

“So now I’m finding myself at food 
pantries, food banks, soup kitchens,” 
Rabe says, “It’s been very hard.”
SNAP 
benefits 
are 
restrictive. 
Shoppers cannot use an Electronic 
Benefit Transfer card, the card that 
allows SNAP users to access their benefits, 
to purchase hot or prepared food, like 
rotisserie chicken. 
However, SNAP gives more auton­
omy to its users than its alternatives: food 
pantries, food banks, and soup kitchens. 
Rabe explains that food pantries and the 
like tend to give primarily canned goods 
and other “pieces of meals.” They are also 
difficult if you have dietary restrictions 
or preferences, such as a gluten-free or 
Kosher diet.
Witnesses to Hunger sees the issue 
of food insecurity magnified among 
families with school-aged children. Their 
current mission is to raise money for 
children at risk of going hungry when 
meals are not available through New 
Haven Public Schools, which is usually 
during school breaks.
School breaks typically occur at the 
end of the month when money is short 
for many families and SNAP benefits have 
been exhausted. To combat this, Witnesses 
to Hunger has organized an initiative to 
provide groceries to families in need. In 
April, before spring break, families could 
pick up groceries at four different public 
schools for easy accessibility. Any left­
over bags were given to local churches by 
United Way and required pre-registration 
to be picked up by families. 
Some families, however, were either 
unable to register or unaware that the 
bags required registration. Anticipating 
this, volunteers were told to enforce the 
registration rule and only give out bags 
to those who had registered beforehand. 
One of these volunteers was Mark 
Griffin, a Witnesses to Hunger mem­
ber. He decided to give the groceries to 
families, even if they hadn’t pre-regis­
tered. “Our hearts don’t work that way,” 
Griffin said. 
Griffin has been with Witnesses 
to Hunger since 2018, four years after 
the New Haven chapter started. When 
the organization began, Griffin would 
go door-to-door with Billy Bromage, 
a member of Witnesses to Hunger 
and the co-chair of the Food Access 
Working Group of the New Haven 
Food Policy Council, to let families 
know about the mobile vans Witnesses 
to Hunger was using to provide kids 
with meals over the summer.
With donations from a New Haven 
Public School Food Service donor, 
Witnesses to Hunger gave out one thou­
sand two hundred bags of food during 
the April 2024 vacation. Their focus now 
is summer break, or the “August gap,” the 
longest of all school breaks.
“One thousand two hundred bags 
may sound like a lot,” said Susan Harris, 
another Witnesses to Hunger volunteer. 
“However, there are over nineteen thou­
sand students in NHPS and all are eligible 
for free or reduced meals at school.”
