I
t started with an X-Acto knife 
and a hairdryer. About six years ago, 
outside the window on the third 
floor of the spiral staircase in Branford 
Entryway E, Kara noticed a small stone 
balcony. The perch was only about eight 
Converse wide, bracketed by shin-high 
stone walls. Two of its sides hugged 
the entryway’s curved body—slanting 
up to stone tiled roof and kissing the 
narrow window. Kara tried to open the 
window to step onto the ledge, but the 
window was sealed shut. So she melted 
the plastic with the hairdryer, X-Acto’d 
through the goo, and officially liberated 
the Branford Balcony.

Or, at least, I think that’s what hap­
pened. I’ve never met Kara. Two of my 
suitemates did, when we were first-
years and she was a senior. One of my 
suitemates remembers talking to her 
at a suite party. The other swears it was 
in a dining hall. Like the history of 
Yale itself, the story of this balcony has 
been constructed by many, often con­
flicting, testimonies.

The balcony became my I-know-
a-spot spot. My let-me-show-you-some­
where somewhere. Everybody wanted 
to show it to their friends, but nobody 
wanted it to be known. It was a corner; 
an overlook; a place to watch the moon; 
a safety hazard; a gossip hideout; a locus 
of conversation, cigarettes, alcohol, weed, 
and make-outs. 

My first-year suite joined in the 
unofficial lineage of the Branford balcony, 
conveyed mostly by passed-down stories 
and light littering. It certainly wasn’t as 
glamorous as other parts of Yale’s campus. 
Though we lived just a floor below, get­
ting onto the perch was pointedly incon­
venient. My suitemate Jamie described it 
as “super whimsical.” Kate had a different 
take: “that shit used to scare me a lot.” 
Simply put, you must:
1) Step up onto the metal handrail of 
the spiral staircase.
2) Wedge your fingers in the narrow 
window frame. Try not to worry that 
they’ll get smushed; they probably won’t.
3) Hoist yourself and pray.
“It’s kind of a collective effort to get on,” 
my suitemate Gianna explained. “It’s like: 
please hold my phone while I clamber up 
and jump up the stairs to try to get up there.”

During our time in Entryway E, my 
suite and I frequently journeyed up the 
stairs to perch on that ledge. We sat with 
the rustling of leaves, the thud of hur­
ried steps below, the constant opening 
and closing of doors in the entryway. It 
became our place—a shared spot apart 
from the supervision and pressures of 
other Yale spaces.

“It wasn’t hidden; it wasn’t private; 
it wasn’t secret,” my suitemate Kate said. 
“Yet somehow it also was.”

For as long as I knew it, the balcony 
bore remnants of this secret life. It’s been 
home to a souring bottle of red wine, 
mysterious crumpled papers, discarded 
blue face masks. Last September, it 
hosted seventeen cigarette butts, a crum­
pled Starbucks pastry bag, and a half-full 
Purell dispenser with liquid that was 
slightly green. 

“If you’re wearing white pants, you 
probably shouldn’t sit there,” my room­
mate Lauren reminded me. “And it’s not 
comfortable at all. And you don’t really 
want to lean against anything.”

In the midst of the rebellion, an air of 
fear pervaded the balcony. There were the 
rational worries—falling, getting locked 
out, staining your pants. But there was 
also a quieter hum to the space. Being 
so high up and out of sight created the 
all-consuming feeling of invisibility. 

“For the most part, if you’re up there, 
no one knows you’re there,” my suitemate 
Beth said. “Everyone walking below you, 
no one knows.”

This sense of removal, when braved 
together, turned into comfort. My suite 
and I felt free of the sterilized world of 
Yale. Our conversations moved from 
tentative high school gossip to divulging 
fears and five-year plans.

This September, Yale Facilities installed 
two shiny metal screws to either side of 
the window’s handle. A small laminated 
sign, haphazardly taped to the glass win­
dowpane reads: 
 Do Not Open Window and Use Balcony
 This is a University Violation
 Violators will be subject to ExComm
 No Questions Asked

I did, however, have some ques­
tions. When I asked Branford Facilities 
Superintendent Ian Hobbs about the 
closure, he had a simple answer: “It’s 
a safety thing…It’s just dangerous.” If 
people walked or sat on the balcony, he 
explained, they could crack the non-load 
bearing roof and create leaks. 

The balcony isn’t a balcony at all. It’s 
ornamentation, never meant for human 
feet. When Branford was built in the 
early 1920s, I doubt they planned on the 
newly minted Collegiate Gothic lending 
itself to such illicit activities. 

But students have a way of finding 
themselves in places they don’t belong. 
Hobbs remembered having the window 
screwed shut years ago. He didn’t think 
much of it again, until he saw a black 
folding chair peeking over the turrets this 
August. Apparently, the screws got loose. 

The balcony is impossible to detach 
from the splendor of Yale. For one, it stares 
Harkness Tower in the face. Everything 
about that 216-foot-tall Goliath has been 
carefully planned: each foot commemo­
rates a year from Yale’s founding to the 
tower’s construction. Climbing its 284 
steps requires an appointment—and 
supervision. Harkness and the balcony 
peer over Linonia Court, which is named, 
of course, after the Linonia Literary 
Society. Entryway E is dedicated to 
James Fenimore Cooper, one of the first 
American novelists. These spaces demand 
sanctioned activity and assert tidy mean­
ings. The balcony resists this order.

I thought about unscrewing the 
new set of hardware sealing off the 
Branford balcony. But I don’t want to 
get ExCommed. Besides, I’d be missing 
the point. It’s not for us anymore—not 
now that I’ve talked to administrators 
about it, not now that there’s a sign 
there stamped with an official Branford 
seal. Still, I’ll remember the way the 
moon looked from up there. We stared 
at it together: full and bright and con­
fessional enough that we could believe, 
even if just momentarily, that we were 
the only ones really seeing it. ∎
