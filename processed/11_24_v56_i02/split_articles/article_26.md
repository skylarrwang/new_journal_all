& payoff’s late. But Mama doesn’t see the flu shots
& Hondas. The interstate wind combing your scalp. Casts
& crutches for you & you & you. Mama doesn’t see the desert drop
Uneven sands. Slithering canals. Little runs
Of water spilling into the front door. Doesn’t see the mop become a fishing line
Like in Jalandhar with Papa. Carp & catfish. The clock face
Fading away. The engine sputters. Mama doesn’t see you face
The pickup truck. The window rolled down, the man ready to take a shot
Five times mumbling & rumbling various lines
That the Gods in his head cast
Him to say. Mama doesn’t stop your blood from running
Down the front door. She doesn’t hear your body drop
Onto the hard tile floors. Mama doesn’t see you die. She’ll hear CNN drop
Your mispronounced name. Your face
Burnt like a ghost onto her TV & his & theirs, run
For the first time from America back to India. They will show one shot
Of your Chevron. Mama will see its neat shelves & clean tiles. Customers will cast
You into a shrine & Mama will visit it when she lands, lips a quivering line. 
Mama will face God & you will respond instead. Tear drops & blood lines
Traded for something Mama will not see: that to run to America was to cast a line & wait
For your shot––stronger than the one that Mama will blame.
