Half of the New Haven Register press building, still 
occupied by the newspaper’s reporters and administrative 
staff, hums with fluorescent lights and muffled typing. 

But in the printing area, the rooms are gapingly empty. 
One room holds rows and rows of the Register’s 
characteristic red curbside newspaper dispensers. 
Arranged in tight lines, they stand like grave-markers. 
The two presses loom in another room; they stand two-
stories tall, as huge and silent as two dinosaur skeletons 
in a monumental hall. Cylinders that once whirred with 
heavy rolls of newsprint now sit empty. Their stillness 
feels unnatural. 
“When the presses were running, it was a very busy, 
loud, mechanical operation, ” Ed Stannard, a long-time 
Register writer, told me. “When they were moving at top 
speed, there was a lot going on, paper flying through. It 
was very exciting.” The presses ground to a halt in March 
when, in an effort to cut back, the Register outsourced its 
printing from New Haven to a press in Hartford, hoping 
to sell the building and move downtown. 

That is, until recently. For one weekend in October, 
Artspace, a local art venue with exhibition spaces across 
New Haven, filled the press rooms with art for its annual 
Alternative Space weekend. “We try to find a different 
vacant building, and a lot of times we try to find 
something that has some kind of cultural significance 
to New Haven. [Local artists] are interested in breathing 
new life into that and making the place come alive again, 
if only temporarily,” said Open Studios Coordinator JP 
Culligan. 

On October 20 and 21, nearly two thousand 
visitors streamed around the presses, staring up at the 
machinery. Roughly 130 artists from around Connecticut 
contributed work to the show ­— canvases, frames, and 
photographs filled the ink-stained walls with color. In one 
room, the empty newspaper dispensers were arranged 
into paths, guiding visitors from video projection to 
video projection. Push for Fire, a piece by local artist and 
Quinnipiac art professor Greg Garvey, showed a man’s 
bathrobe as it burst into flame. It crumpled into twisted 
black ash. A tie, a jacket,  and a pair of leather shoes 
followed. 

One room later, canvasses were displayed on 
makeshift walls that hung around the printing machinery. 
Visitors ascended a stairwell filled with the singing of 
a young musician who crouched under the stairs, and 
they emerged onto a catwalk that surrounds the presses’ 
upper level. Ellen Hackl Fagan, a Harlem-based artist 
who lives in Connecticut, had provided visitors with  
label makers so they could adorn the presses’ expansive 
control panels. One visitor gleefully printed out labels 
to name one dial “happiness,” and another “madness.” 

The Register hopes that after selling its current 
building, it can move from its fairly remote location on 
Long Wharf Drive to downtown New Haven “where 
we were born, and lived most of our lives,” as reporter 
Ed Stannard told me. The paper has big dreams of 
engaging more directly with the community, making the 
Register a public space with open news meetings and a 
“newsroom cafe.”
But the Register’s current location has been a New 
Haven landmark for many years. David K. Thompson, 
a photographer native to New Mexico, was drawn to 
the possibility of using the Register for an installation. 
“I wanted to interact with the machines themselves,” 
he told me. In his piece, titled Off  Register in reference 
to a printing term for misaligned elements, a video 
projection played on the rhythmic copper slats of one 
of the presses. The metal shone with the light of the 
projector and a film of people moving shone on its 
surface. Artifacts of communication sat in front of the 
press — antennas, stacked television screens displaying 
static, speakers blaring mechanical noise, and a thick 
book bolted shut. 

“The main motivation of this piece was to add a 
reanimation to the machinery here . . . to show some 
movement in there when the movement’s gone,” 
Thompson explained. 

Some artists, including Thompson, created work 
informed by the decline of print. For Greg Garvey, the 
Register’s resident ghosts were ominous. “In the room 
where the video is being shown, there are all these 
newspaper dispensers, and I made an instant mental 
comparison to one of the final scenes in Citizen Kane, 
when there are all these crates and boxes in his mansion 
after he died,” he told me. 

Noel Sardalla, a local artist, stood in a small, empty 
Register office as visitors to the exhibit streamed in and 
out. One by one, carefully, he threaded paper flowers 
from the floor beside him onto fishing line. Made from 
newsprint, the flowers were delicate and small -- each was 
only a few inches across. The line formed a net, attached 
to the ceiling, that hung a few inches away from the wall. 
The flowers suspended within it seemed to float. The 
piece, titled The Paper It’s Printed On, contained the text of 
hundreds, thousands, of newspaper articles — nutgrafs 
and decks, all folded into one another, swinging gently 
in the air.  The flowers moved slightly in the breeze of 
a visitor who walked by briskly, looking at the phone in 
her hands. 

For a few days, light played across the press again. 
The video room’s projectors threw shifting lights and 
colors onto the walls. Artists stood by their work, heads 
thrown back in laughter or bent in discussion with 
passing visitors. Guests walked by holding wine in a clear 
plastic cup. The rooms were loud, filled with the buzzing 
of conversation and the faint clicks and whirrs of audio 
installations. Faintly, in the background, I imagined I 
could hear the clamor of the presses as they churned 
out paper. “It’s unfortunate to see something like that 
disappear,” Culligan told me, “but at the same time, at 
least we get to throw a going-away party for it.”

**Title: Teaching Tongues**
**Page number(s): 5-6**

In Navajo, the phrase “I want to weigh you” 
translates directly from English into “I want to hang 
you.”

Some elderly members of the Navajo tribe still 
laugh about the old misunderstanding, but for Chris 
Brown ‘15, it represents the need for doctors that speak 
the Native American language.  When he was younger, 
Brown witnessed the poor healthcare his relatives, 
especially his grandmother, received on the reservation 
from doctors who did not speak the language. He 
resolved to return to a Navajo reservation as a doctor 
and help the elderly, many of whom do not speak 
English, receive adequate care.

Navajo is not taught as a language at Yale so Brown 
applied to Directed Independent Language Study, or 
DILS.  DILS offers the opportunity for students to work 
one-on-one with a “language partner,” a native speaker 
that guides them through their independent study of the 
language. For two hours each week, Brown has a Skype 
conversation with his language partner Jolyana Begay, a 
professor at the University of Arizona.

Popular DILS languages are less widely useful than 
languages like Chinese or Spanish, and the languages 
that trend in DILS projects are telling of cultural and 
academic patterns at Yale, in New Haven, and in the 
country as a whole. 

Trends in the popularity of languages taught in 
the classroom evolve slowly in response to changing 
political and economic balances between nations. Only 
the largest political and cultural shifts seem to make a 
mark. The popularity of Russian spiked during the Cold 
War. In the 1990s, students took interest in learning 
Japanese during Japan’s period of economic prosperity. 
More recently, in the post-9/11 era, Arabic has become 
more popular. 

DILS is a sensitive barometer that gauges the 
popularity of lesser-known languages, said Nelleke Van 
Deusen-Scholl, director of the Center for Language 
Study. 

The program is more responsive to micro-trends 
in the interests of the student body, and not necessarily 
sweeping geopolitical trends. After the Haitian 
earthquake, more students wanted to take Haitian 
Creole through DILS. Cantonese is currently one of 
DILS’ popular languages. According to DILS director 
Angela Gleason, a large number of students who grew 
up speaking Cantonese at home who have no other 
way to study the language. On a campus where many 
students are uncertain about their interests, DILS is a 
small, self-selecting program. 

Chelsea Wells ‘13 took Choctaw through DILS 
in the fall of 2011 as a way to connect to her heritage. 
Wells’ motives for learning Choctaw reflects a larger 
trend toward the celebration and conservation of less 
widely spoken languages. Her language partner was a 
woman from her hometown in Oklahoma, and Wells 
said it was great to learn from somebody from the area 
in which the language was spoken.

“Very few young people in the Nation speak 
Choctaw,” Wells explained. Her great-grandfather spoke 
the language, but did not teach it to anybody because 
of stigma against Native American languages. Wells 
views her study of Choctaw as a way to affirm that 
the language is a positive part of the culture. Though 
she says her studies were not necessarily practical, they 
fulfilled her in other ways.

But some do choose languages to match specific 
professional goals. Justin Hunter Scott GRD ’13, an 
African Studies student, took Twi, a Ghanaian language, 
through DILS so he could travel to Ghana if his plans to 
do research in Nigeria did not work out. Similarly, Alexa 
Little ’15 is studying Nepali through DILS with language 
conservation in mind, since she hopes to pursue a career 
conserving endangered languages in villages in the 
Himalayas. 

Gleason also explained that while selection of 
a student for DILS is based on merit, the number of 
students that can be accepted to study each language is 
somewhat dependent on the amount of money set aside 
for that language. European languages like Armenian

and Hungarian tend to receive the most funding. 

However, the logistics of tracking down native 
speakers of the language to serve as language partners 
can prove difficult. The partners are crucial since, 
as Ravi Pokhrel GRD ’13, a DILS language partner 
in Nepali, explained, DILS is less a class and more a 
series of conversations. Wells discontinued her study of 
Choctaw this fall because her language partner retired, 
and DILS could not find a replacement for her. Scott 
similarly had difficulty finding a Twi speaker to mentor 
his independent learning. The challenges of executing 
DILS limit who completes it successfully.

The small size of the program contributes to its 
low profile on campus. Applications for the spring 
semester are also due several months before the end of 
the fall semester, meaning a lot of students do not know 
about the program until after the deadline, Brown said. 
Students can only take DILS for four semesters while 
at Yale, an unfortunate limit for those trying to keep up 
with a language for a post-graduation goal. 

If there is enough interest, languages offered 
through DILS can transition to Yale’s standard course 
offerings, though there are many other factors involved 
in that decision. In part due to a high demand for Dutch, 
the administration set up a program in the summer of 
2011 and offered two levels of the language this fall. 
Through DILS, students reflect a body of smaller, 
diverse interests and help Yale stay relevant.

And, as Brown knows, relevance is power. He hopes 
to make being a doctor on a reservation more relevant. 
In the Navajo language, cocaine is represented by collage 
of words, a description of white crystals that you snort. 
“A lot of elderly people see their grandchildren and stuff 
using cocaine.  They might not know, if their doctor 
says “did they have crack” or something; but if their 
doctor says [the same thing] in a traditional method of 
explaining it, then it works out better.” Communication 
is key.



**Title: Feed a Fever**

O
n a Saturday evening in late June, a man 
dressed in flourescent tie-dye presses his 
thumbs together and curls over his fingers to 
form a flying heart. The Carolina Chocolate Drops is 
playing “Cornbread and Butterbeans” to subburned 
picknickers who skip and swing feverishly on the New 
Haven Green. Eric Triffin, with his tightly sprung coils, 
a receded hairline, and a full white beard, dances alone to 
the left of the stage. He wears a tie-dye T-shirt featuring 
a giant pink heart that cushions the rainbow peace sign 
strung around his neck. His dance moves are varied 
and interpretive, sometimes vaguely yogi-esque—he 
balances unsteadily on one leg and swims through the 
air; he runs frantically in place with limbs flying in all 
directions and he whirls around in a dizzy trance — but 
what he called his “visual applause” never falls short of 
euphoric. Eyes closed, smile bursting, he is a display so 
uninhibitedly outlandish — seemingly delirious, even — 
that I wonder if the high of summertime music can fully 
account for it.

To New Haven locals, Triffin, also known as 
“Trippin’ Triffin,” “Eric the TranscendDancer,” or 
simply “Carrotman,” West Haven Public Health 
employee for nearly twenty-four years, is a celebrated 
local fixture. His infectious presence and psychedelic 
performances have been visible at local festivals and live-
band performances for decades — including, as Triffin 
claims, over five hundred Mondays of Rohn Lawrence’s 
“Smooth Jazz” at Lilly’s Pad. He’s been known to make 
appearances in everything from a giant carrot costume 
to — as Toad’s bartender Aspen Powers confirms — 
full-body electroluminescent wiring that can strobe in 
beat with the music.

There’s no doubt that Triffin’s seemingly unhinged 
image can initially be perplexing. “From a distance,” 
Richard Borer, West Haven’s former mayor, tells me, 
“it’s easy to think he’s some burned-out hippie walking 
down Chapel Street.” Indeed, “hippie” is a title that 
Triffin himself fully embraces. In a voice full of whimsy, 
he tells me that his heart has felt the affirmation of the 
love generation at Woodstock. 

Perhaps nothing is more perplexing than attempting 
to reconcile this image with Triffin’s professional career. 
While Triffin claims that dancing is what he’s doing 
when he feels most alive, he knows what it means to 
“bring home the tofu.” He worked at West Haven

**Title: Eric Triffin: A Public Health Renaissance Man**
**Author:  Not specified**
**Page number(s): 10-12**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Public Health as Health Educator (1986-1990) and then 
became the city’s Public Health Director (1990-2010).
Triffin, who received his Master’s in Public Health 
from Yale School of Public Health in 1984, has secured 
West Haven hundreds of thousands of dollars in state 
and federal grants for everything from a “Childhood 
Immunization Registry and Tracking System” to “Bio-
terrorism and Emergency Response Preparation.” He 
implemented West Haven’s lead poisoning and childhood 
immunization programs, as well as initiatives to lower 
infant mortality in the area. He’s 
written at least nine opinion 
pieces and letters to the editor in 
the New Haven Register over the 
years, as well innovative public 
health essays such as: “Food-a-
Go-Go School Cafeterias: State 
of the Art Centers for Excellence 
in Nutrition and Hygiene.” On 
their 
350th 
anniversary, 
Yale 
School of Public Health awarded 
him a place on the Public Health 
Community Service Honor Roll. 
New England Division of the 
American Cancer Society has 
recognized him as “one of the 
most influential persons in the fight against tobacco 
during the last 25 years.” To top it all off, he’s fluent in 
three languages — French, English and Italian — and 
has a foothold in Spanish, Russian, and Sanskrit.


It’s an impressive resume, one that reflects what 
Robert Kilpatrick ventured to call Triffin’s “anything 
but disconnected” style. According to Kilpatrick, who 
worked for over thirty-five years with the Cornell Scott 
Hill-Health Center, it was this holistic approach to 
public health that brought Triffin to bat for the center 
when they struggled to open a branch in downtown 
West Haven back in 1995. A number of city council 
members were resisting Hill-Health’s proposal. “There 
was all this concern that there would be drug addicts 
lined up at the clinic door, causing a nuisance in the 
neighborhood,” Kilpatrick tells me. As West Haven’s 
liaison with Hill-Health and a staunch advocate of the 
clinic, Triffin was appalled. When he spoke about it, his 
voice lost its usual whimsy and his eyes narrowed. “It 
was unfathomable. These were sick people who needed 
healthcare.” Ultimately, Triffin successfully applied to 
have West Haven identified as a medically underserved 
area; a high-need, low-income designation that helped 
garner the funding and recognized the urgency for Hill-
Health to set up a clinic on Main Street.


Triffin’s work has not lacked style; Borer has called it 
the “Triffin School of Public Health.” Chuckling fondly, 
Borer recalled how Triffin started doing outreach from 
a Volkswagen bus. A card-carrying vegan, Triffin began 
driving to local festivals, farmers markets and exhibitions 
in the bus, where he would don his “Carrotman” or 
“Snappy the Peace Pod” costumes to promote healthy 
living. It’s a tradition he eventually brought to the West 
Haven Green when he started their first farmer’s market, 
and one he continues to this day. “May peas be with you, 
may peas be with you,” he beams, almost manically, as he 
hands out snap peas to passersby. 
“Now you may have peas within,” 
he says, and then, swirling around, 
”You too can create whirled 
peas.” He ends with one final 
addendum, which he delivers with 
a hint of self-satisfaction: “But 
I’m just a hip-pea.”


Kilpatrick remembers Triffin 
in the midst of an ultimately 
successful 
campaign 
to 
ban 
smoking in public places in the 
state of Connecticut. “I was at 
the capital in Hartford at this 
conference, and when Eric’s 
turn to make a statement came, 
he went up and burst into song.” He laughs. “He had 
changed the words of…I’m pretty sure it was ‘Who let 
the dogs out?’” Triffin’s approach offered a proactive 
and creative influence against a material culture in which, 
Triffin argues, “We’re infecting kids with bad [choices]. 
Advertising is a vector for chronic disease.” 
According to Borer, Triffin’s was a user-friendly 
approach that attracted people’s attention not only in a 
way they would remember, but in a way that would work. 
“Eric’s very wise,” Borer tells me. “He’s the type of 
person who could communicate anything to just about 
anybody, whether it was some high-ranking official from 
the state of Connecticut or the federal government or it 
was a single mom on the streets who needed assistance.” 
I can confirm this — Triffin, very effectively, explained 
the digestive system to me by starting with the assertion 
that a person is a lot like a donut. 


As Borer puts it, “[his approach] wasn’t ivy-tower 
stuffy intellect, but a very down-to-earth, folksy, ‘this 
is how we’re going to get people healthy’ form of 
innovative brilliance.” And, he added, the nation should 
use this grounded innovation in the burgeoning field of 
public health. He recalls an old mantra of Triffin’s: “it’s 
more of what’s happening between your hands that will 
hurt you more than anything else that’s going on in the 
world.” 
While Triffin claims 
that dancing is what 
he’s doing when he feels 
most alive, he knows 
what it means to 
“bring home the tofu.”


When Triffin reflects on his unconventional 
approach to the role of Public Health Director, the 
deliberative nature of his genius shines through. “I may 
look like a fish out of water,” he admits, “but I’m more 
like a Shakespearean fool.”


I 
meet with Triffin on a chilly October afternoon at 
Edge of  the Woods, a vegetarian health food market 
on Whalley Avenue where he does twice-weekly food 
demonstrations — on this particular day he’s making hot 
malt cider. After a quick lap around the store, I spot him 
at the end of the gluten-free aisle with a fresh tray. It’s 
a natural fit for Triffin, who got his start in nutrition 
— in the seventies, he started New Haven’s first food 
co-op and a vegetarian restaurant with his brother Kerry 
called “Down to Earth.” For him, the appeal of the 
store has a lot to do with freedom — “freedom from 
mega food corporations, freedom from killing animals, 
freedom from packaging, labeling, advertising, and 
preservatives…” He does a little jig as he explains to 
a shopper (miraculously without a spill). “Why not live 
lighter, closer to the sun, and with less of a footprint?” 
Graphic design student Benjamin Niznik MFA ’14 
catches up to Triffin just before I do. “Eric! I’m doing 
this project and I want you to participate.” He peels a 
softball-sized orange sticker off a sheet and asks Triffin 
to wear it. “The project is all about health and positive 
energy,” he explains to me later. “That’s Eric, in essence. 
The oranges are the equivalent of a virtual liking system 
in reality.”


Later, Triffin and I sit in the bakery café, sipping 
cider while he reflects on nearly six decades in New 
Haven. His narrative unfolds tangent by tangent, never 
lacking in intrigue or personal charm. With the exception 
of first grade in Paris and sixth grade in Rome, Eric grew 
up in New Haven, graduating from the Hopkins School 
in 1969 — the same year he attended “3 Days of Peace 
& Music” at Woodstock. His was a large, liberal family. 
Wearing his “Snappy the Peace Pod” costume, Triffin holds up snap peas at Edge of  the Woods Natural Market. 


“I think I was 5 or 6 years old, building fall out shelters,” 
Triffin recalls, his blue eyes lighting up as he ventures 
back into his memory. “My mother was teaching yoga 
to paraplegics in a cool atelier in Paris in the forties, and 
feeding us carrot juice and wheat germ and growing 
sprouts in the fifties and sixties. She was sort of on the 
spiritual side.” Triffin’s father, meanwhile, was Belgian 
economist and Yale professor Robert Triffin, who 
first proposed implementing a common currency to 
unite Europe. “My father was a monk in economist’s 
clothing,” Triffin laughs. “He always said ‘unity creates 
peace.’ He dissolved borders that had been fought over 
for hundreds of years.”


Eric recalls dinner table 
debates in the Triffin household 
where The New York Times was 
always on the kitchen table. “My 
mother was kind of on one side 
— very touchy, softy — and my 
father was on the other — more 
organized and theoretical.” The 
discussions drove Eric to seek 
out a middle ground, much 
like the one his career in public 
health seemed to epitomize. 
His story is interrupted 
when a woman slides a business 
card across our table as she exits 
the café. On the back, she’s 
written a note asking Triffin 
to call her about speaking for 
a Sierra Bridge Club event 
to protest a coal plant in 
Bridgeport. A few minutes 
later, another graphic design student approaches, 
asking Triffin to discuss MSG for a film she’s making. 
“You’re the third student to hit on me now,” Triffin jests. 
“Somebody else just gave me a card for a photography 
gig!” In September, Triffin made his music video debut 
in Tori Amos’ “Flavor” video. Eric-fever is rampant. 


“I 
ended up in Public Health,” Triffin levels, “because 
it was public and healthy, and not about working 
for the man.” 


Triffin’s life philosophy is one of wellness and 
community, decidedly nurturing of freedom, knowledge, 
and love — not necessarily convention. “I’m all about 
cooking two casseroles in one oven, not killing two birds 
with one stone,” he tells me. It’s a simple and honest 
philosophy that seems to perfectly reconcile “Eric the 
TranscenDancer” with Eric the Health Director. 


Given Triffin’s pacifism — he’s gone so far as to 
excise all “violent” language from his vocabulary — he 
was frustrated by what he perceived to be a “militaristic” 
shift in the field of public health after 9/11, marking a 
turning point in his career. As the wars in Afghanistan 
and Iraq gave rise to concerns of bioterrorism, the pro-
wellness, grassroots initiatives that had long characterized 
Triffin’s work were sidelined. “There would be powdered 
sugar on the street…and all of the sudden Eric would 
have to be dealing with anthrax,” Borer recounts. When 
I ask Triffin about this, he groans as he reminisces 
on “the absurd idea that Saddam would be infecting 
us with smallpox.” The Public Health Director’s job 
description seemed to include new defense initiatives, 
like establishing a position of 
Homeland Security Coordinator 
for West Haven and leading 
emergency 
preparedness 
exercises in the community. 


Triffin became uncomfortable 
with 
the 
work, 
ultimately 
viewing it as an alarmist 
extension of a war effort he 
could not bring himself to 
support. His feeling was that 
the only effective way to disarm 
violence would be through 
promoting health. We should 
have been “exporting tractors…
building wells and desalinization 
plants,” he explains.


Triffin’s 
disenchantment 
was evident to Borer, too. “I 
could always tell when Eric 
wasn’t 
buying 
something,” 
Borer tells me, “because he would suddenly get very 
quiet, purse his lips, and just sit there. That’s the closest 
thing to a negative reaction you’ll ever get out of Eric… 
I could tell he was frustrated.” Ultimately, the Director 
handed in his resignation to the Department of Public 
Health in 2010. There are certain fevers Triffin cannot 
pass on. After all, he explains, “when you show up at a 
bioterrorism conference dressed as a giant carrot, there 
are people that simply don’t approve.”


Nowadays, Triffin has put a new twist on his work, 
focusing mainly on outreach and “edutainment” as he 
continues his twenty-five year side career as an adjunct 
Professor of Public Health, Wellness and Nutrition at 
Southern Connecticut State University. “For twenty-five 
years I contained contagion,” he says, dancing along to 
his own words with hand gestures. “Now I’m trying to 
spread contagions of caring and infect people with good 
health. Good food, good music, good energy, good 
His feeling was that the 
only effective way to 
disarm violence would 
be through promoting 
health. We should have 
been “exporting tractors…
building wells and 
desalinization plants,” he 
explained.

dancing, good friendships, and good exercise.“ He is a 
self-proclaimed player and performer, a seeming vector 
of love and energy. He gushes over an encounter he had 
at this year’s Gathering of  the Vibes. “Someone came up to 
me said, ‘I think of you every day. Seeing you be free to 
do what you love makes me be more free.’ And then she 
disappeared off into the crowd.” 

My phone buzzes one evening in early December 
to a text message from Triffin. Earlier that 
day, I’d called Eric to ask what his earliest childhood 
memory was, struggling to picture him at a time before 
he developed his energy and acute eye for the world. 
His response had been hesitant — uncharacteristically 
uncomfortable, even — but he’d told me that I’d caught 
him on his way back in from a hike. He set in on a 
beautiful description of young summers spent on a bean 
and peach farm in Tuscany. 
In the text message, Triffin reveals to me his actual 
earliest memory; that of being in utero, in the “womb 
room.” Amid severe complications with her pregnancy, 
Triffin’s mother had been advised to abort by the chief 
obstetrician at the American Hospital in Paris. Instead, 
she heeded the word of a midwife, staying bedridden 
through the final months of her pregnancy.
“Throughout my youth, I would feel this sense of, 
like, three atmospheres weighing on me. It would come 
over me a couple of times a year, only when I was very 
relaxed, and stopped entirely when I was about twenty-
eight. I could feel myself being breathed by an entity 
greater than myself, very protected and totally connected 
to everything around me.” 
“I think it gave me a leg up in peacefulness, 
connectedness, and comfort with my environment,” he 
continues. “Perhaps my first dancing was in utero.”
It’s by far the strangest thing that Triffin has 
ever shared with me, and yet, I find it compellingly 
honest. Triffin’s self-conscious revelation is impossibly 
grounded, even in its visceral otherworldliness. 
It reminds me of a comment he had shared with me 
just that morning: “Someone once told me that I danced 
in order to pretend that gravity affects me.”
Whether he’s dancing with his feet or with his words, 
Triffin has a unique way of making sense of most 
things, revealing wisdom and truth to his audience just 
as Shakespeare’s fool does. But perhaps Triffin’s clearest 
moment is when he explains his own vibrant identity. 
“Viruses are embedded in the DNA, the very fabric, 
of all life,” he spells out with a smile. “They’re the 
motivators that push us to look outside ourselves and to 
share, to learn, to explore beyond convention. Aren’t we 
all simply looking to find a host and connect?”
There’s a lot that can get lost in the unorthodox 
image of Triffin, but eventually, the beauty of his 
genuine substance sneaks up on you and forces you 
to think. My mind often flickers back to the festivities-
infected New Haven Green, where I first met Triffin. 
As I laughed and speculated where he missed the turn 
to Woodstock, he asked me, “What are you doing when 
you feel most alive?” 
I should have sensed the contagion then.

**Title: Growing Up Eli**
**Author: Arielle Stambler**

For Yale kids, home is a 
public place.
Eight-year-old Yaqub Bajwa is, on average, a foot 
shorter than his friends and ten to fourteen years 
younger than them. Their statures give them a 
bit of an advantage over him in volleyball, but he is their 
equal in games of Risk. Sometimes they talk about basic 
chemistry and other times they talk about Madagascar 3. 
As a kid growing up at Yale, Yaqub regularly interacts 
with a world he is too young to fully participate in—or 
understand—but that doesn’t keep him from trying.
At 5:30 one evening, I see 
Yaqub saunter into the Timothy 
Dwight dining hall beside his 
mother Lisa Bajwa, TD resident 
fellow, who holds his two-year-
old sister, Aya, propped on her 
hip. His father, Omer Bajwa, has 
some business to attend to tonight 
as Yale’s Muslim Chaplain, so it 
won’t be a full family dinner. 
Yaqub runs into his friends 
as he meanders through the 
dining hall. When they ask him 
how his day is going, he launches 
into the saga of his extraordinary life: how his sister 
has recently learned how to turn doorknobs and keeps 
coming into his room to steal his stuffed animals, or how 
he hid a plastic spider in his teacher’s book as a practical 
joke. Yaqub knows how to work a room.
I catch a glimpse of Yaqub as he rolls his eyes at his 
sister Aya when he sits down at a table. She is pushing 
her toy stroller around the dining hall, but it won’t quite 
fit between the packed tables and she is starting to fuss. 
I sense his mom panic ever so slightly about a temper 
tantrum brewing. She placates Aya by promising her that 
she can draw with the sacred box of markers when they 
get back to the apartment.
Yaqub and Aya have to behave beyond their 
maturity levels because they spend so much time 
in public. Yaqub in particular has to assume two 
personas—one that’s playful and relaxed inside their 
resident fellow’s apartment and 
one that’s composed and well-
behaved around TD. “When we 
moved in, we sat [Yaqub] down 
and told him he had to have a 
certain respectful tone of voice in 
public,” Bajwa said. “You always 
have to be on when you’re out.”
Bajwa believes that his son 
has grown up a lot even in the few 
months since his family moved 
into TD. Since Yale students 
lavish so much attention on him, 
Bajwa sees what he calls their 
“emotional intelligence” beginning to rub off on him. 
“My kids have become more socially mature and more 
sociable since coming here,” he said. “It’s noticeable. My 
parents have said it. My in-laws have said it.” 
Being a Yale kid comes with perks. Clare 
Hungerford, the eleven-year-old daughter of Morse 
Master Amy Hungerford, and Marty Keil ’12, son of 
former Morse Master Frank Keil, both told me that one 
of the best parts of being a campus kid is the Master’s 
house. When Marty moved into the Master’s house at 
age eleven, he was most excited that it had the Game 
Show Network. When he went to dinner in the Morse 
dining hall at night, he could drink as much soda as he 
wanted. 
LEFT: Morse Master Amy Hungerford’s kids, 
Cy and Clare, enjoy Hounfest during her time as 
Calhoun’s interim Master. 
Just like any Yalie, 
Yaqub has learned 
how to organize 
his social life 
around meals.

Clare gets to have a lot more sleepovers than before 
because the house is much more spacious than her 
old one in East Rock. When her friends come over on 
Saturday nights, they watch movies and talk and play, 
and marvel at the floor-to-ceiling glass windows on the 
lower level of the house that reflect the image of the 
living room at night. But her peers are conscious of the 
oddness of her home. “They think it’s cool, but they 
wouldn’t want to do it,” Clare said. 


Having people in your house so much of the time 
takes some getting used to. A self-proclaimed dog 
person, Clare uses her new puppy, Toller, to help her 
integrate into social situations with older people. Her 
mom has noticed. “It helps her to feel like she has a 
role if she’s taking care of him in this context of a busy 
party,” Hungerford said.


Clare learns a lot from the guests and students she 
meets, but knows that she occupies a strange space at 
Yale. She’s not a peer, not a friend, but rather a fixture 
of Morse life. “Yale students are nice,” she said. “I kind 
of talk to them. But they talk more to each other.” 


Ultimately, this place is a club to which she is occasionally 
given elite access and from which she is also occasionally 
barred.


That boundary between Clare and Yale students 
even exists for seventeen-year-old Kate Bradley, daughter 
of Branford Master Elizabeth Bradley, despite her 
involvement in campus activities. She plays intramural 
squash for Branford, uses the library and the gym, 
goes out to New Haven restaurants for dinner with her 
brother, and gets advice from Yale students about what 
to study and what college life is really like, but Kate still 
knows that there is an invisible gulf between herself and 
the average Yalie. “A lot of students are only one year 
older than me, but it feels like there is such a difference 
between us,” she said. 


During his seven years living in the Morse Master’s 
house, Keil took full advantages of those boundaries. 
He said any student who happened to see him walking 
around Morse when he lived there would have thought 
of him as that “quiet Master’s kid.” He isolated himself 
from Yale student life, choosing instead to focus on the 
trajectory of his own life; it took him until senior year 
of high school to learn how to get to Old Campus from 
Morse. 


His world felt a little more normal than many 
Master’s kids’ because most of his friends at Hopkins 
School were also connected to Yale. His good friend 
Joe Schottenfeld ’12, son of Davenport Master Richard 
Schottenfeld, is exactly Marty’s age. Joe had his bar 
mitzvah party in the Davenport dining hall. Marty had his 
eighth grade graduation after-dance in his living room. It 
was an unusual way to grow up, but they normalized the 
experience for each other.


At fourteen years old, Marty told the Yale Daily News 
that he was “definitely tired of Yale,” but now admits 
in retrospect that he did not really know the University 
until Bulldog Days, when he thought about it as a college 
option for the first time. 


Clare is adamant about not wanting to go to Yale for 
college. “If I stay in one place and experience everything 
I have all over again, it’s not really a completely new 
experience or getting away from mom and dad,” she 
reasoned. Clare already overhears students stressing 
about midterms and congratulating each other on 
consulting jobs. She sees fliers for information sessions 
about studying in China and running HIV clinics in 
Ecuador. And she hears her mom get out of bed at 
2 a.m. to break up parties, knowing that students are 
outside behaving in ways that she has been taught not 
to behave. 


Amy Hungerford is not too worried about Clare 
observing those moments. “I am sort of fearless about 
knowledge in children,” Hungerford said. “There’s an 
occasion to talk about what they’re learning and seeing 
in the world.” These conversations happen very openly 
in Kate’s family as well. “When we talk about it, my 
parents treat me like an adult,” she said. 


Since Bajwa is raising his children in the Muslim 
faith, which prohibits drinking, college partying will 
eventually call for serious conversations as Yaqub and 
Aya get older. But those discussions are still a long ways 
off. “I think if my kids were teenagers and they were 
seeing kids partying on Friday nights, that would have 
been more worrisome for me,” Bajwa said.


The kids of Yale see hundreds of examples of 
ways to be in the world while growing up here. These 
kids are imagining how they will navigate their college 
experiences and, like the students, learning how to mold 
the people they will become. 


As Yaqub and I walked out of the dining hall after 
dinner, he pointed to the lit windows around the TD 
courtyard to show me where all of his friends live. 
He’s seen some of their rooms multiple times. He was 
sad that I had to leave, but he wanted to know what 
residential college I was in. Although he hadn’t heard of 
Morse before, when I mentioned that it was right next to 
Stiles, his eyes lit up. “My family eats in Stiles all the time. 
Maybe I’ll see you there at dinner again.” Just like any 
Yalie, Yaqub has learned how to organize his social life 
around meals. I’m sure I’ll see him there soon, stealthily 
carrying a plate of French fries to his seat before his 
parents can stop him, and beaming with pride every time 
a friend puts out a hand to give him a low-five.

hunks of metal lie like carcasses on the grimy 
floor, and rust grows like mold on pipes in 
English Station, a non-operational coal and 
oil power plant sitting on a man-made dredge island 
in the middle of the Mill River. On October 2, New 
Haven resident Chris Randall ventured into its depths 
and returned with photographic evidence of a surreal 
landscape.


“It’s kind of like a ghost,” Randall said. While 
exploring the site, he imagined what it would have been 
like for people to work at the plant. It must have been 
noisy—not like the dusty silence he experienced. “I can’t 
go into a place like that and not try to envision what it 
was like when it was at its capacity,” he said.


Few have seen English Station’s interior for the past 
ten months; the property is contaminated with dangerous 
amounts of asbestos and polychlorinated biphenyls 
(PCBs), and no work is being done to remediate the site 
due to a cease and desist order issued by the Connecticut 
Department of Energy and Environmental Protection 
(DEEP).


Randall has lived on Lyon Street, about a mile away 
from the site, since 2000. He is the executive director 
of New Haven Land Trust, and he runs a photography 
blog, “I Love New Haven,” with 2011 New Haven 
mayoral candidate Jeffrey Kerekes. He posted a set of 
photos under the title “English Station Invasion (Part 
A photographer helps capture the true picture 
of  a contaminated plant.

and contamination includes battles between owners and 
local environmental organizations, cleanup attempts 
that have spiraled into stagnation, and an overall lack of 
access to basic knowledge of the situation. 


Local residents are unable to navigate the 
bureaucratic mess, leaving them unaware of risks 
presented to public health and the local environment, 
especially as scavengers distribute contaminated 
materials from the site. The site’s potential hazards 
loom, but little is being done. 


Currently, English Station is off limits to its owners 
and their contractors because of the DEEP’s 
cease and desist order, issued in February. The DEEP 
is currently waiting for John Insall, who works with 
Stantec, a professional consulting service, to draw up a 
remedial action plan, Kaufman said. Kaufman said that 
the owners eventually want to redevelop the building, 
but declined to give specific information.


Most recently, English Station has been in the 
news because 24-year-old New Haven resident Sammy 
Gonzalez was arrested after being electrocuted when 
he cut through a power line at a UI substation at 
English Station. Even though English Station is no 
longer producing electricity, there is still an operational 
substation on the property. Roughly three thousand 
residents of East Rock were without power for three 
hours on November 29, and Gonzalez faces many 
criminal charges.


Dave Hartman, public information officer of the 
New Haven police department (NHPD), said that there 
is an ongoing investigation and that a motive has not 
been identified. According to an NHPD press release, 
Gonzalez “faces several criminal charges including 
burglary, criminal attempt to commit larceny and breach 
of peace in the first degree for the service interruption.” 


II)” in early October, and the New Haven Independent 
published six of those the next day. The newspaper had 
run photographs from his first expedition into English 
Station in March.


The trip into the station was motivated in part by a 
desire to expose its innards to the general public and in 
part by his curiosity. “I wanted to see what it looks like,” 
Randall said. 


“This place is a big part of our historical narrative 
and we deserve the right to see what it looks like.”


A few days after he posted the pictures, he received 
an email from Lori Saliby, a supervising environmental 
analyst at DEEP.  Saliby works with the DEEP’s storage 
tank and PCB enforcement unit. 


“Well, shit, I must be in trouble now,” Randall 
remembered thinking.


Luckily for Randall, he wasn’t in trouble, at least 
not with the government. He was told that his health, 
however, might be in danger. Sailby said that when 
they spoke over the phone about his visit, she told 
him that he had potentially contaminated himself and 
his companions, and that he may have transferred 
contamination off the site. Randall said she seemed 
concerned about his safety. 


Randall was not as concerned. “I guess that’s a risk 
I took,” he said. “Hopefully nothing happens.” The 
owners, however, don’t share his nonchalance.


“What he did was foolish, what he did was 
dangerous,” Uri Kaufman, real estate developer and 
consultant to the owners, said. “It was dangerous to him, 
[and] it was dangerous to others.”


Kaufman told me that the owners filed a criminal 
complaint against Randall for trespassing on the 
property. Randall said that he was unaware of any such 
action.


English Station’s complicated history of ownership 


Hartman said that Gonzalez is in critical condition, 
and is being treated for burns from electrocution. He 
said that, given the difficulty of accessing burn victims, 
it would be a while before they can establish a motive. 
The interview process has not yet begun.


However, 
Hartman 
speculated 
about 
what 
Gonzalez’s intentions might have been. He said that it 
might have been one of three things: “stupidity at the 
grandest level, an attempt at sabotage…[or] the theft of 
copper.”


In the nineties, while working as a freelance 
photographer for UI, Harold Shapiro photographed 
English Station when one of the turbines was being 
dismantled for cleaning. Shapiro is the head of the photo 
department at Creative Arts Workshop on Audubon 
Street, a community art school in New Haven. An 
associate fellow in Jonathan Edwards College, Shapiro 
has worked as a full-time photographer since 1981, and 
started doing freelance work for UI in 1989. Shapiro 
photographed for internal publications and captured 
some images of the interior of the power plant. At the 
time, UI owned English Station, which it built in the late 
1920s.


Ever since he was a child, Shapiro loved lighting and 
electricity. He was naturally attracted to power plants, 
which produced both. 


“While I was taking pictures of that I was able to 
explore the cavernous beauty of the space,” Shapiro 
said. He was fascinated by the “accidental beauty” of 
the pipes and metal structures. “I also play woodwind 
instruments,” Shapiro said, “and the beautiful shape of 
the saxophone and flute…are reminiscent a little bit to 
me in the power plant.”


Shapiro’s photographs, in contrast to Randall’s, are 
mostly sharp and clean. They depict an English Station 
that is an object of industrial strength and power, not of 
decay. The plant was about to go offline. 


In 1992, UI stopped power production at English 
Station and mothballed the plant, shutting it down in a 
manner that would make it easy to restart in the future. 
It is unclear why UI shut down the power plant—local 
activists said that it was because the plant was inefficient, 
and UI declined to comment for this story.


UI transferred English Station in 2000, with about 
$4 million for remediation, to Quinnipiac Energy, LLC 
(QE). QE acquired English Station with the intention of 
opening it as a peaking plant, which meant that it would 
only generate power during times of peak demand like 
the summer months when air conditioning use was 
especially high. 


The New Haven Environmental Justice Network 
(EJN) was formed in response to QE’s application, said 
Mark Mitchell, founder of the EJN. The EJN took issue 
with QE’s plan, since it would provide power to Fairfield 
County, which is in the 94th percentile of median 
household income according to recent census data, at 
the expense of polluting the low-income neighborhood 
of Fair Haven. 


It would have been especially harmful for residents 
living in nearby public housing facilities, such as Farnam 
Courts, which is less than half a mile west of English 


When Joe McAllister got the news that the DEEP 
had issued a cease and desist order for Grant 
Mackay Company’s project at English Station, he 
traveled to Connecticut immediately. McAllister has 
been working for GMC for four years, and took his 
current position as general counsel in the summer of 
2012. He describes himself as “the emergency guy.” 
The cease and desist order “was a complete shock,” 
McAllister said. To this day, he continued, nobody from 
the DEEP has explained why the order was issued.


When I relayed this to Saliby, she responded, “Well, 
that’s a complete shock to me.” She said that she met 
with McAllister and engaged in many phone calls after 
the issuance of the order.


McAllister and Kaufman agree that GMC was hired 
and began its work in the summer of 2011. The original 
contract was for GMC to perform a demolition and 
to abate the asbestos. They would “make it a level, flat 
island, like there hadn’t been a building sitting there,” 
McAllister said.


Kaufman later requested a change to the contract. 
Both hold the change came before the cease and desist 
order was issued by DEEP on February 8, 2012. 
Kaufman sought to modify the contract and add an 
option for Asnat and Evergreen to decide if they wanted 
to change the work plan from a full demolition to an 
interior demolition. An interior demolition would entail 
removing non-structural metal, but would keep the 
building standing. In order for the owners to act on this 
option, they would need to pay GMC an extra $850,000 
in cash. Barring the exercise of this option, GMC would 
proceed with the original plan and demolish the building.


Kaufman said that the application for the 
demolition permit was filed so that the owners would 
have the option to knock down the building if they 
wanted to. He said that, at the time the owners filed the 
application, they had not made up their mind about the 
fate of the building. It would be months before GMC 
finished the asbestos abatement and would be ready to 
commence demolition, if the owners desired it. But they 
were nowhere close to carrying out the action.


“It would be a shame if the cease and desist order 
were issued based upon a mistaken assumption that the 
building was slated for demolition,” Kaufman continued. 
Kaufman said that the decision to demolish either 
the interior or exterior of the building could have 
gone either way, but that it was dependent on the city 
approving the demolition permit. President of the New 
Haven Urban Design League, Anstress Farwell, said 
that since English Station is listed in the local historic 
resource inventory, the submission of the demolition 
permit triggered a ninety-day delay of demolition 
ordinance process. If a demolition permit is filed for any 
building listed in the local historic resource inventory, 
the state register of historic places, or the national

register of historic places, ninety days must pass before 
the demolition permit may be granted.
“The whole purpose is not simply to delay someone 
for ninety days, but to create a period of time when you 
can hopefully and reasonably seek out alternatives to 
demolition,” Farwell said.
The filing of the demolition order set off a chain 
reaction. Over the next three months, Farwell gathered 
her forces, contacting partner organizations like the EJN 
and the New Haven Preservation Trust. They contacted 
city officials and helped coordinate the appointment of 
Robert Smuts ‘01, chief administrative officer in New 
Haven, as the point person for the English Station at the 
city level so that someone could coordinate the response 
across the relevant departments.
The goal? “Get the site cleaned up and preserve the 
building,” Farwell said.
The City of New Haven never approved any 
demolition permits for English Station, said Andrew 
Rizzo, a building official with the City of New Haven. 
It is likely that this chain reaction made it all the 
way up to the DEEP. Saliby said that GMC’s demolition 
application triggered the order, and that DEEP received 
documents submitted by representatives of the property 
to the City of New Haven that described the methods 
of demolition. Saliby didn’t know how these documents 
came to the DEEP, but she did know one thing – they 
specified that the demolition would be an implosion.
“If this site was not cleaned up and you implode 
the building, then all the contaminated debris, just like in 
the films at 9/11 with the dust cloud coming down the 
street…is going to fly all over the neighborhood and the 
river,” Saliby explained.
McAllister argued that GMC had not decided 
on an implosion, calling Saliby’s fear a “red herring.” 
Furthermore, the application for the permit to demolish, 
filed in Rizzo’s office, did not make any mention of 
methods for demolition.
“The cease and desist order is a solution looking for 
a problem,” McAllister said.
A hearing pertaining to the cease and desist order 
was held by DEEP on October 1 at which Attorney 
Alan Kosloff, counsel for the owners, did not contest the 
order.  Because the owners were unable to provide GMC 
with access to the property, the contract is terminated, 
as far as GMC is concerned, said McAllister. However, 


---
GMC is continuing to be involved in the situation only 
to the extent necessary to retrieve its equipment from 
the property. The company continues to pay $20,000 a 
month in rental fees for equipment that is sitting on the 
site. McAllister estimated that the company has lost over 
$3 million since July 2011.
Kaufman said that the owners have filed a lawsuit 
this November against GMC, believing the company to 
be in default of the contract. 
“They have a responsibility,” Kaufman said. “They 
don’t have the right to walk away from this.”
Insall is working on a remediation plan to submit to 
the DEEP. Kaufman said that the goal of the plan that 
Insall is working on is to clean up the PCBs in the soil, 
and also to get permission for the owners to return to 
the site to finish the asbestos abatement.
McAllister made it clear that GMC would not be 
returning to the site, regardless of the owners’ plan.
“Grant Mackay will never do work on that site 
again,” McAllister said. “Or for that owner. Or in the 
state of Connecticut. All three.”
O
n a Monday afternoon last month, I was walking 
with the area with Randall, the photographer. At 
around 2:30 p.m., I turned and saw two men close the 
trunk of a car that was parked at the gate in front of 
English Station. Lines of barbed wire ran above metal 
sheets a few feet taller than myself, and signs on the 
sheets warded off trespassers. In a small public gravel 
lot between the site’s gate and Grand Avenue, two men 
jumped into a Lexus SUV, and the driver started pulling 
into the road.
I ran and tried to flag the car down. The passenger 
opened the window, but when I began to introduce 
myself, rolled the window up as the car sped away.
Randall said that he recognized one of the men. 
When Randall had been inside English Station, Randall 
had seen one of the men scavenging five pounds of 
copper. At the time, he told Randall it was “so he could 
eat.”
With the cease and desist order, there is limited 
security at the site, leading to increased scavenging of 
raw materials. Some of the scavenging is legitimate, 
conducted under the approval of the owners, while 
some of it is not.
Brendan Regan has been the owner of Regan 
Metals, a scrap metal company less than a mile away 
from English Station, for the past thirty years. The 125-
year old company was hired by QE to take scrap out of 
the site between 2003 and 2005. Regan described the 
situation at English Station at the time as “weird” and 
“bizarre.”


Many people claimed that they owned the property, 
Regan said. QE would grant his company permission 
to scrap at the site, and then other people would arrive, 
claim they were the owners, and tell Regan Metals 
that they were not allowed to collect scrap metal. One 
time, some people who claimed they were the owners 
attempted to take some of the generators out of the 
plant. “[They were] going to take the big giant generators 
in there and ship them off to Africa,” Regan said. His 
reaction to the situation: “Ok, let’s just get the hell out 
of here.”
While Regan’s company was working to collect 
scrap metal at the site, they would often see or hear 
evidence of scavengers. Kicked down doors lay flat on 
the floor and windows and locks were broken. Other 
times, they would hear foreign noises while doing their 
work; noises came from other sections of the building 
and gave away the presence of people who were not 
supposed to be there.
“People would break into that building every single 
week,” Regan said. “They’re still breaking in there today.”
On the afternoon I visited, the men I saw might 
have been scavenging, but neither Randall nor I could 
see. A trespasser was arrested in October. While these 
two incidences might not have involved stealing scrap 
theft, those who do scavenge play an important role at 
the English Station. Not only are they trespassing on 
the site, stealing scrap metal and financially damaging 
the owners, but they also may be harming themselves 
through exposure to asbestos and PCBs, and spreading 
PCB contamination in the community.
Saliby said exposure to PCBs is associated 
with reproductive disorders, infertility, small head 
circumference in newborns, neurological problems such 
as ADHD, and cancer, specifically tumors of the thyroid, 
liver, and kidneys. It is unclear how much exposure the 
surrounding neighborhoods experience. The PCBs at 
the English Station won’t go anywhere unless they are 
moved by a disturbance. Trespassing, she explained, 
therefore creates a problem for local residents.
She added, “It is possible for contamination from 
the site to migrate to nearby surface water as well as 
groundwater.”
McAllister told me that asbestos-related dangers to 
those who enter the plant have been compounded by 
the scavenging activity. When people remove metal from 
English Station, they might also rip into the insulation, 
which releases asbestos, he said, freeing it into the air 
where it can be breathed. 
Even before GMC came on the scene, scavengers 
caused asbestos problems. Regan said that, although the 
boiler house, which was filled with asbestos, was locked, 


people would often break into it, and his company 
would have go in to secure the room. “It looked like a 
winter wonderland. It was freaky, man. The stuff was 
just hanging from the ceiling.”
Kosloff said that his clients are working with DEEP 
to develop a site security plan, which is in progress. 
Saliby detailed some of the security measures 
currently in place. They include a locked gate, barbed 
wire, razor wire, large warning sings about PCBs, and a 
surveillance camera. These are not associated with the 
plan that Kosloff mentioned.
In addition to harming themselves and possibly their 
community, scavengers are taking income from whoever 
cleans up this site. Remediation of sites like English 
Station is paid for in part by selling some of the material 
on the site for scrap. Scavengers stealing metal make it 
less financially viable for a contractor to clean up the site, 
since they reduce the amount of metal available to sell 
for scrap and cover the cost of remediation. McAllister 
is also worried that GMC’s tools and equipment, which 
it has not been able to access since the cease and desist 
order was served in February, may be—or have already 
been—vandalized or stolen. The contamination poses 
a danger for many parties involved, but it seems only a 
major act of intervention can completely solve it.

nglish Station is one of more than 284 brownfield 
sites in Connecticut, according to DEEP as 
of October 2011. A brownfield, according to the 
website of the US Department of Housing and Urban

Development, is “an abandoned, idled, or underused 
property where expansion or redevelopment is 
complicated by the presence or potential presence of 
contamination.”  The Government Accountability 
Office estimates that as many as 425,000 brownfields 
exist in the US. 

Redeveloping brownfields can provide economic 
benefits. According to the website of the EPA, 
brownfield redevelopment has created over 5,500 jobs 
in the 2012 fiscal year alone. To that extent, New Haven 
sees English Station as an economic opportunity.  

New Haven has partnered with a local economic 
development organization to facilitate economic growth 
along the Mill River. The city may be interested in 
including English Station in specific plans in the future, 
said Tony Bialecki, deputy economic development 
director for the City of New Haven. 

However, because of the current 
environmental issues, the city has 
not been able to develop a strategy 
for addressing it.

Preserving 
the 
building 
as a historic site might also be 
economically 
beneficial. 
John 
Herzan, preservation services officer 
for the New Haven Preservation 
Trust, said that he hopes English 
Station can be placed on the national 
register of historic places. “We hope 
that this designation would provide 
economic incentives for reusing the 
building rather than demolishing it,” 
he said.

Residents would also like to see English Station 
brought back to life. Aaron Goode, who is on the steering 
committee of the EJN, said that English Station “fell on 
hard times, like the rest of New Haven. I sincerely hope 
that it can also be part of New Haven’s renaissance.”

But he qualified that statement, adding that this is 
possible “if we do the right kind of intervention.”

T
he first time Randall entered English Station, 
he wanted to get onto the roof. He went up 
with a friend, and took some sunset pictures.

As it got dark, Randall decided that it was time to 
come down. But he couldn’t find the way out.

“There’s really no logical sequence to get from 
one floor to another,” Randall said, speaking about one 
particular section of the building. “I was using my flash 
as a strobe to see. It took us forty-five minutes but we 
found our way out.”

TNJ
Randall is lucky that it only took him minutes to get 
out; it has taken me on the order of a hundred hours 
(and nearly as many phone calls), and I still haven’t found 
my way out. Some of the other actors haven’t been 
able to get out for years and years. The current owners 
have held the property the six years and counting, and 
residents have been saddled with the toxic site for much 
longer.

The toxicity of the site comes not only from its 
physical contaminants. The property is also contaminated 
with rumors that have been accepted as truth, a history 
of miscommunication, and a general lack of accurate 
information. Confusion amongst the official actors – 
the local, city, state, and private entities – trickles down, 
leaving the public puzzled and therefore frustrated. The 
complicated interplay between actors leaves everyone 
with a complete and accurate 
picture of the situation.

With his DSLR camera, 
Randall 
captured 
several 
different exposures of the same 
scene using slightly different 
settings. He then layered the 
photos on top of each other 
using a digital image editing 
program, with a process called 
high dynamic range imaging.

“You’re basically able to 
emphasize 
or 
deemphasize 
certain components or features 
of those exposures in the final 
image,” Randall said. 

“I guess it’s a philosophical thing whether or not 
that’s an actual representation of reality or not,” Randall 
said. “To me, it is. To me, the process adds something 
that wasn’t there. To me, it almost makes it look more 
real.”

Randall’s photographs depict English Station 
as a dilapidated industrial graveyard and Shapiro’s 
photographs show a once clean building. Just as it is 
hard to believe that they were photographing the same 
building, different people tell me stories that, while not 
necessarily opposing, appear to contradict each other.

Randall’s photographs present an eerie, unsettling 
view of reality. But, as McAllister and Regan described, 
English Station was not what it first appeared to them 
to be.

**A Fence Divides**
**Page number(s): 27**

P
ale-barked branches dip over the fence between 
Hamden and New Haven like old arms. Separat­
ing Hamden, a working-class suburb, from three 
public housing projects in the neighboring city of New 
Haven, there is a 12-foot tall fence. Five-inch long sil­
very, bolted strips link sections of the fence. Its thick 
metal grating fractures views of neighbors’ homes ten 
paces away. Added-on pieces of fence drop into vacant 
spaces among tree roots, screening even squirrel-sized 
holes. The projects are walled off on three sides. Across 
the street from the fence in Hamden, a racially mixed 
neighborhood where the median income is $71,358, a 
green Jaguar rests in the driveway of a boxy, colonial 
home next to two decorative Christmas deer. In the New 
Haven projects, where average income is $12,989 and al­
most all residents are black, low-slung apartments decay 
between patches of broken pavement.

Hamden Mayor Scott Jackson calls the fence a relic 
from the past, a barrier that allows Hamden residents 
to ignore the aspirations of people in the projects. “It’s 
about preserving a mythology,” Jackson told me. “The 
myth is that the people living on the New Haven side 
will be fundamentally different from people on the 
Hamden side.” 

Jackson, a tall, slender man of 40 and Hamden’s 
first black mayor, can be accommodating, speaking in 
cool, vetted sentences designed to repel searching ques­
tions. But he’s also a performer conscious of his iconic 
status, relishing occasions to enlarge his small office. “It 
is not enough to be right; it is our duty to be righteous,” 
he told a Hamden crowd on January 15, 2010 – Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day. Jackson declared that 1960s-era seg­
regation was not long past. Its villains, he said, practiced 
a “hate based on whispers.” He hoped his sons would 
grow up in a nation renewed, defined by the promise of

an “American dream, unrestrained.”
But that hate seems to linger – perhaps in few places 
more visibly than in the town Jackson now leads. Ham­
den’s fence prohibits access to public roads on three 
sides of the projects. Over 3,500 feet long, it assures that 
the one road into the projects is also the only way out. 
Residents hoping to buy groceries at a Hamden shop­
ping center three miles away have to travel into New Ha­
ven to get around the fence, a 7.7-mile trip that takes two 
buses and up to two hours to complete. In the case of a 
flood or fire, emergency vehicles have to travel around 
the fence to help residents in the projects. For Jackson, 
the fence proclaims a prejudice 
against the poor that middle-class 
neighborhoods across America 
already whisper.

Hamden built the first ver­
sion of the fence in 1966, a four-
foot tall chain link fence intended 
to keep crime out of an aspir­
ing middle-class neighborhood. 
White, 
working-class 
families 
were fleeing the city projects, 
leaving behind densely concen­
trated poverty. Drug activity and 
violence rose, sometimes spilling 
into Hamden. Crime was so bad that residents say the 
New Haven Fire Department refused to enter the West 
Rock projects without a police escort.

By 2005, those dangers had disappeared. The New 
Haven Housing Authority had cleared the Brookside 
and Rockview projects in preparation for remodeling, 
leaving only the elderly and disabled residents of Ribi­
coff in the West Rock area. Crime dropped dramatically 
in the empty communities as new, mixed-income hous­
ing units rose. But that same year, almost four decades 
after it first built a fence, Hamden responded to holes in 
it by erecting a second, parallel fence, adding a sturdier 
barrier around the city projects’ three edges that rises in 
places to 16 feet.

This fence is now the focus of a fight over its re­
moval that may be more complicated than anyone is 
willing to admit, confounding simple race and class di­
vides. The fence turns neighbors into opponents and 
stereotypes into reality, chaining both communities to a 
past they want to escape. For Mayor Jackson and others, 
the question is whether the myth that one town’s success 
requires the other’s demise will endure in 3,500 feet of 
metal.


J
ackson hoped to begin dismantling that impression at 
an August 29 public meeting in Hamden. New Haven 
Mayor John DeStefano, Jr. and representatives from the 
New Haven Housing Authority were on hand to pres­
ent plans for the new projects. Housing Authority rep­
resentatives came prepared to explain that new home-
ownership units and market-rate rental homes would 
diversify the projects and decrease crime. They hoped 
to tell Hamden residents about a pilot program offering 
job training and education to residents of the projects 
who committed to becoming self-sufficient within seven 
years, effectively imposing term limits on subsidized liv­
ing. New Haven officials brought a traffic study showing 
that removing the fence would not add significant clutter 
to any new intersections. Jackson 
hoped his constituents would lis­
ten to the evidence and talk like 
neighbors. 
But 
instead 
of 
civility, 
Jackson was met with rage. Any 
pretense of cordiality or common 
concern disintegrated. Under the 
fluorescent lights of the Keefe 
Community Center gymnasium, 
where three hundred people were 
packed into a space meant for one 
hundred, Hamden residents slung 
insults at New Haven. Stocky men 
lined up two deep along the walls and young couples 
craned their necks in the doorway as residents whispered 
talking points about crime and traffic into each other’s 
ears. An angry, unbridled Jackson emerged.

Jackson was still introducing the proposal to tear 
down the fence when one man called out, “It’s not going 
to happen!” The crowd’s whoops drowned his pleas for 
civility. “We’re here to talk. We’re here to talk. We’re not 
here to yell, alright?” he shouted, eagerly at first, then in 
desperate whines.

Anger and fear trampled conversation. Hamden 
residents described the robberies and traffic overflow 
they said would result from opening the fence. 
“Keep Hamden in Hamden and keep New Haven 
in New Haven!”
“That’s their choice to live by a fence.”
“You put a street through, you’re jeopardizing every 
single person in this entire room’s life.” 
Mayor DeStefano, who is white, told me that 
“nowhere in history” have good fences made good 
neighbors. At the meeting, hoping to mend the 
developing rift between Hamden and New Haven, he 
rose to boos, spoke through insulting chatter, and ended 
by tabling his request for the fence to be torn down in 
favor of a year of dialogue between residents from both 
communities.

December 2012
Near the end of the evening, Jackson was asked 
what he thought of the fence. For three years, since 
his election in 2009, Jackson had defended the fence. 
“Particularly as an iconic mayor in some ways, it was 
very important to me to listen more than I talked,” he 
explained, referring to his status as Hamden’s youngest 
and first black mayor. But now Jackson, ineffectual and 
exposed, let himself speak. “I don’t like the fence, but 
I understand it,” he said to more boos. He meant he 
understood people’s old fears of crime from the projects, 
but denied that walls were the answer. One woman 
stood screaming rejoinders at him from a distance of a 
few feet until police nudged her away.

More than the meeting’s result, I puzzled over the 
mood in the room that night. Residents of Hamden, black 
and white both, hurled invectives against New Haven 
residents charged with a dangerous sort of animosity. 
The fence was more than a bulwark against crime and 
traffic. Something about those people in the projects needed 
to be contained. It wasn’t race; the Hamden crowd was 
at least half black. It wasn’t simple geography or class, 
either; the crowd seemed to fear more than that in its 
neighbors. Something was amiss. “It did not feel like a 
safe meeting,” the Hamden town planner, Leslie Creane, 
told me. The gym was choked with a tension that seemed 
primed to explode.

It nearly did when Mike Hutsell, who lives near 
the fence in Hamden, stood to ask his question. He 
charged Jackson with forgetting constituents’ problems 
with crime. “How many times have you had your house 
broken into?” Hutsell demanded.

Jackson began to answer, but Hutsell interrupted, 
saying he wasn’t finished, and soon Jackson was pointing 
his left index finger at Hutsell and moving towards him, 
his eyes splayed wide and his shoulders hunched in 
tension as if restraining his body. “You ask the question, 
I answer,” Jackson yelled, angry that Hutsell spoke over 
him. Then again, without restraint, “YOU ASK THE 
QUESTION, I ANSWER.” Two people grabbed hold 
of Jackson’s shoulders and pushed him into the hallway. 
The demons Jackson once described on Martin Luther 
King, Jr. Day had come out to play in the town he now 
ran and they chased him from the gym.

A 
few weeks after the meeting, as Jackson sat 
behind his desk on the third floor of Hamden’s 
Government Center, I asked him what made him lose 
his cool.

“I just, I didn’t like the tone,” he said before trailing 
off. “Let me see if I can find something real quick.”

Jackson turned to his computer monitor. I guessed 
he was searching for a nasty constituent email or a 
recording of the meeting. “Sometimes being a student 
of this stuff makes it a lot more challenging than it 
probably needs to be,” he mumbled. 
 “Alright, this is a good one,” he said finally. Jackson 
turned his computer monitor around. On the screen was 
a photo in which two thickly clad firefighters turn their 
hoses on a black woman crouching against a lamppost 
in the 1960s. “In 2012 we can clearly look at that picture 
and say who’s right and who’s wrong. Clearly.” He said 
he felt for the firefighter who rested his head on his 
pillow every night knowing he was the bad guy. “Being 
on the wrong side of history is something that I find to 
be just the worst possible way to look back at the way 
I have done my job. I prefer to be ahead of the curve 
of history.” The fence, a relic from a time when certain 
people couldn’t choose where they ate or made their 
homes, was well behind that curve. Bringing the fence 
down, he said, was the right thing to do—or would one 
day be seen that way. “In fifty years, one hundred years, 
somebody’s going to think this is right.”

Then who were the people from Hamden standing 
against Jackson, the people whose grudge against the 
projects resisted the tide of history and overwhelmed 
politicians? Jackson explained that they are working class 
and many are black. Some grew up in the projects. They 
go to church with people from New Haven. Jackson 
said the piles of media reports he’d seen painting his 
constituents as out-of-touch elitists had gotten it wrong 
in a reach for the obvious story. 
People in Hamden weren’t quite keeping out a 
social class or set of values, it seemed. They were 
shutting out something harder to define, a mentality 
feared and unknown, a lifestyle of limited possibilities 
and government handouts not so distant from their 
working-class suburb. 

I
t took me only a few minutes in the home of Mike 
Hutsell, the same man who clashed with Jackson at 
the meeting, to realize that those fighting to maintain the 
fence aren’t exaggerating their fears. Hutsell lives with 
his wife Marilyn on Woodin Street in Hamden. They’re 
a black, working-class couple, and they keep a baseball 
bat by every door of their home. They said they’ve had 
two cars stolen and their house broken into once, in­
cidents they blame on New Haven criminals who they 
say crossed into Hamden before the second fence was 
raised in 2005. Mike sleeps with a Browning high-pow­
ered 9 millimeter gun under his bed. Marilyn sleeps with 
a Smith and Wesson 357 Magnum. Before he goes to 
sleep Hutsell enables five locking devices on his Dodge 
minivan. “That’s because the government can’t or won’t 
protect us,” he said. “That fence is our security.”

Marilyn led me to a dining room attached to the 
side of her home draped in red and gold cloth. A wreath 
hung on the wall and the table was set permanently for 
eight, plastic leaves scattered among gold plates and 
thick candles. Sheets of wood made up the walls. It 
looked like a life-sized construction project, and I won­
dered why Marilyn had chosen this setting. Suddenly she 
blurted its purpose. “We built this room by hand.” The 
dining room was a monument to the value she most 
wanted to impress on me: the Hutsells were self-made 
folks.

Marilyn said the difference between people in Ham­
den and the people in New Haven’s projects is work 
ethic. When Marilyn had a heart attack at age sixty, she 
ignored doctors’ advice and returned to her job at a law 
firm. Mike has two bad knees and a bad back but drives 
an oil delivery truck during the week and works at a se­
curity firm on weekends. “This is what you achieve by 
pulling your own self up. We’re not for entitlements,” 
Marilyn declared. She said people who claim that there 
are no jobs available, even in the projects, aren’t trying. 
“All you have to do is just look for it.” 

Marilyn said she feels proud driving down Woodin 
Street. “They are the homes of working class people.” 
They don’t have junk in the yard and if they do, it’s about 
to be cleaned.

The Hutsells said they supported the fence be­
cause they wanted to rest without worrying their things 
would be stolen. But their anxieties weren’t all so basic. 
“I don’t want to see the thugs, as my husband said, with 
the pants hanging down and the stuff that comes out 
of their mouths,” Marilyn explained. When I asked her

Some Hamden residents worry that tearing down the fence will lead to crime by increasing contact with residents of  the Brookside projects.

to describe the connection between home invasions and 
people in the projects, she hesitated, her nervous eyes 
searching the ceiling. She stammered: “Someone that is 
of another culture or another, I don’t know how to say 
this respectfully – someone being thuggish – has this 
idea, ‘Oh, if I rob this person I can make money.’ That’s 
crazy.”

When I asked her what troubled her about the 
projects, Marilyn didn’t seem most concerned about 
physical crime. Instead, she complained about “people 
in grocery stores with food stamps and you know they 
don’t need them.” She said people invented hardships 
to hoard handouts and turned down jobs to qualify for 
free oil. She seemed almost to be replaying the critique 
of “welfare queens” that Ronald Reagan delivered in his 
1976 campaign, poor blacks cheating the middle class 
of their wealth. Working-class Marilyn was a rung above 
those black people.

Marilyn’s fear of thugs and food stamps wasn’t 
far from a caricature of anti-poor prejudice, but it also 
wasn’t far from human. Like many middle-class Ameri­
cans, the Hutsells say their work doesn’t guarantee them 
the comfort it once did. For the first time since the 
1920s, median family income has dropped substantially 
over a decade. Family income last year was eight percent 
lower than it had been in 2000, compared to what is usu­
ally a thirty percent rise during eleven-year periods. The 
Hutsells are worried with reason, delaying retirement 
while they watch tax dollars go to the poor.

But the Hutsells’ argument was still aggressive and 
apocryphal. In their minds, food stamps weren’t a con­
sequence of economic decline. They became the cause 
The newly constructed projects, now called the Brookside Estates. 


of that decline. The middle class wasn’t struggling be­
cause globalization and automation were raising demand 
for skills and pushing down pay. Social programs for the 
poor were driving middle-class hardship.

The Hutsells saw poor people as perpetrators in 
this system. They weren’t poor by circumstance, but be­
cause of insufficient work ethic, a condemnation almost 
as permanent as one based on race or ethnicity. The kind 
of person who chose to be poor deserve to be fenced 
in. As Marilyn said, “If you don’t want to get a job and 
you want to live in low-income housing, that’s on you.”

But people like the Hutsells were intensifying New 
Haven residents’ dependency, stranding them on a 
walled-in peninsula far from jobs and public services. I 
asked Marilyn how she’d respond to people in the proj­
ects who felt penned in. “If that fence makes you feel 
insecure, then you come and live where middle class 
America lives. On the other side of that fence. And you 
take on some of the responsibilities that middle class 
America has taken on and cherishes.”

The Hutsells at their home in Hamden.


Jackson isn’t unaware of the Hutsells’ fears. Back 
in his office, he told me the difference between Ham­
den and New Haven is stark. Hamden residents have 
spent years getting up for work every morning. Life in 
the projects, where jobs come and go and apathy and an­
ger reign, is hard to imagine. But Jackson said Hamden 
had a choice.

“Do you establish public policy out of fear or out 
of hope?”

I
n the newly redesigned Brookside projects in New 
Haven, brightly colored homes are still being built. 
Sidewalks, trees, and spaces between homes have been 
planned to make the projects safer and friendlier. One 
hundred subsidized housing units are already occupied, 
along with two home-ownership units. Omar Ursini, 41, 
a new resident, was hopeful about the changed commu­
nity but worried the fence would obstruct growth. “It’s a 
cage,” he said. “That’s all it is.”

In practical terms, the fence terrifies Leslie Creane, 
Hamden’s town planner. She worries Brookside will 
have more difficulty filling 
its middle-income units and 
home-ownership 
units 
as 
long as the fence stands, 
keeping poverty concentrated 
and raising risks of crime. 
Connected streets are also 
safer streets. In the case 
of an accident or tornado, 
emergency 
vehicles 
from 
Hamden would reach the 
projects faster without a fence.

The New Haven Housing 
Authority built the West Rock projects in the 50s after 
more desirable public housing plots were exhausted. In 
fact, the land on which the projects were built was once 
Hamden property. On maps, it looks as if someone cut 
into Hamden’s otherwise smooth border with a scalpel 
and heaped the dirty plot into New Haven. The land 
had been a pig farm before the projects were built, 
undesirable from the start. “New Haven clearly found 
the most remote corner to put lots of poor people,” 
Creane said.

By 1992, unemployment was 88 percent in Rock­
view and 76 percent in Brookside. Jesse Phillips, whose 
aunt lived in the old Brookside, told me as a kid he 
found bodies lying in the road. Ursini, the Brookside 
resident, said residents in the old Rockview rolled dump­
sters filled with burning trash into the street so police 
couldn’t get inside. 

Bus routes used to stop passing through the proj­
ects at 5 p.m. Even now, Creane asked, do residents want 
to risk getting home late from work and walking from 
the bus stop to their homes down a haunting stretch of 
dead end road? “It’s a perfectly plausible survival skill. 
This has nothing to do with not wanting to work. This 
has to do with infrastructure and public policy deliber­
ately conspiring against you.”

In Westville Manor, a public housing project farther 
from the fence in West Rock, drug deals still happen on 
the purple playground slide. Candace Jones, who helps 
run a youth organization there called Solar Youth, has 
had her offices broken into three times this year. When 
a New Haven police officer arrived to respond to one 
break-in, he told Jones, “I don’t even know why you 
help these people. Don’t you know who you’re work­
ing with?” She said buses are often late and the drivers 
don’t seem to care. After all, people in the projects have 
nowhere to be.

Jones recounted a conversation with an eleven-year-
old student who had been excited to join the local drill 
team, but decided not to try out. The girl’s reason? “My 
mom has applied to so many jobs 
and she doesn’t get any. I’m not go­
ing to get it either.” Jones said she 
wished it was as simple as ‘just get 
up and get a job,’ as the Hutsells de­
mand. But hopelessness is infectious, 
and dreams shrivel quickly. She said 
children in the projects don’t have 
the “drive that I can get out there 
and be somebody” because they are 
confronted with barriers, not oppor­
tunities.

F
rom the back doors of their homes on Thorpe 
Drive in Hamden, residents can walk six steps and 
touch the fence. Harvey Massey, 73, and his wife Miriam, 
72, white residents of Thorpe, opened the first door I 
knocked on. They spoke to me through their screen 
door, but knew what I wanted. “I’ve been broken into 
four times and robbed twice,” Harvey said immediately, 
as if reading a script all of Hamden knew. He said the 
crimes took place in the seventies.

“It’s not like we’re all white, but we’ve all worked for 
what we have,” he said when I asked what distinguished 
people in Hamden from people in the projects. “We de­
serve security, we deserve the comfort of being in our 
homes without someone breaking in.” Harvey told me 
he grew up in the Brookside projects and didn’t want to 
let that way of life into Hamden.

I was confronted with the same attitude that ap­
peared in the Hutsells’ dining room, but this time I didn’t 
“In the civil rights era, 
you didn’t allow folks to 
figure out on their own 
how not to be racist.”

have to go searching for its troubling undercurrents. 

“I felt like I was raped,” Miriam blurted, unprompted, 
referring to the break-ins. “I felt absolutely violated.” 
Her words were charged with a disgust that signaled 
something uglier than the considerable distress a rob­
bery might provoke. Robbery became rape, a personal 
violation, perpetrated not just by any criminal but by an 
Other whom she hated.
“It’s a pig pen,” Miriam said later of Ribicoff, un­
prompted again, seeming repulsed. “It’s dirty.” But Ribi­
coff wasn’t a pig pen until it was fenced in. And it didn’t 
become “dirty,” a stain on the clean suburbs, until neigh­
bors like Miriam called it a pig pen. The fence helped 
people in Hamden weaponize their words, turning the 
projects into a pen and making the projects’ residents 
dirty.

is one of the few public officials 
who has never equivocated on the 
fence. “In the civil rights era you 
didn’t allow folks to figure out on 
their own how not to be racist,” 
he said, explaining that he hopes 
someone challenges the fence in 
court. “You forced the issue.”
Sitting at a Popeye’s chicken 
restaurant, Goldson said the fence 
is a reminder that racism still fouls 
American cities. After Hurricane 
Katrina, a group trying to evacu­
ate New Orleans was stopped on 
a bridge by police officers from 
neighboring Gretna, Louisiana. Officers fired warning 
shots at the group and told them they wanted “no Su­
perdomes” in Gretna, “code,” one evacuee wrote in a 
later account, “for if you are poor and black, you are not 
crossing the Mississippi River.” The Gretna police chief 
told the San Francisco Chronicle that his officers had been 
ordered to seal off the suburban city.
Goldson explained: “If you can put a fence to stop 
people from looking for a job, go shopping, go visit their 
aunt who lives in Hamden, what’s to stop you from put­
ting up a fence across a bridge when there’s a disaster 
in the town next door and there are folks that you don’t 
want to see in your town?”
In a 2005, a group of black public housing residents 
from Baltimore sued the U.S. Department of Housing 
and Urban Development, alleging racial segregation and 
discrimination in the city’s public housing system. One 
of the offenses they charged was the construction of a 
fence separating the public housing development from 
a predominantly white community nearby. The judge 
ruled that the government did not violate the Equal Pro­
tection rights of the black residents because the fence 
was motivated by concerns about crime rather than race.

Goldson’s counterpart in Hamden, its strident citi­
zens’ most loyal supporter of the fence in city 
council, is Mike Colaiacovo. Colaiacovo passed out nine 
hundred and fifty flyers telling residents about Hamden’s 
August 29 meeting. Residents skeptical of all levels of 
government reserved only thanks for Colaiacovo. He 
was a responsible man serving a responsible citizenry.
Colaiacovo ignored my twice-daily calls to his home 
and cell phone for two weeks. I left messages telling him 
his constituents trusted him. Would he please answer a 
few questions?
Finally, I drove to Colaiacovo’s home and knocked 
on his door. It was 5 p.m. on a 
Friday. The blinds were drawn 
and the house looked dark. His 
nephew, Mark, twenty-one, an­
swered the door, eyes droopy and 
shoulders slouched. Was this Mike 
Colaiacovo’s home? Mark pointed 
behind him towards the kitchen, 
where a short man in gray, cot­
ton shorts and a baggy sweatshirt 
stuck his face out from around 
a corner. Colaiacovo shook his 
head and slipped back behind the 
corner. Mark told his uncle again 
who I was. Colaiacovo’s face re­
emerged, glassy eyes on a small, 
weathered face beneath a mop of black curls. He disap­
peared again into the kitchen.
I had the sense that something was wrong, but Co­
laiacovo slowly dragged his body forward. “Come in.” I 
asked him about his defense of the fence. “We’re used to 
Brookside neighborhood and gunshots and, you know, 
stuff like that, you know, and so they’re very, uh, how 
could I say it, scared, scared, scared of what’s gonna 
happen there, you know?” What about the August 29 
meeting? “Crazy,” he chuckled. Mayor Jackson’s out­
burst? “Disappointed.”
Colaiacovo’s eyes were bloodshot and he fidgeted 
his fingers nervously in his lap. He asked me whether I 
wanted a drink. His voice slipped between registers and 
his eyelids drooped. Mark, more alert than his uncle, fin­
ished his sentences and reordered his words. “Do you 
have concerns about how the fence affects people in the 
projects?” I asked. Colaiacovo shrugged, his eyes search­
ing for focus while his eyelids shuttered again. “It is what 
it is,” he slurred. He was drunk, and I left.
Colaiacovo told me later that he had been celebrat­
ing his nephew’s 21st birthday. But even if he had suc­
cumbed to nothing worse than a few moments of self-
indulgence, the visit was troubling. While his constitu­
ents blamed New Haven’s poor for failures of discipline 
they said justified the projects’ enclosure, Colaiacovo, 
buttressed by a status quo that gave him an advantage, 
enjoyed a consequence-free afternoon of excess.

When I met New Haven’s Mayor DeStefano in his 
downtown City Hall office, one of the first things 
he expressed was his pride that New Haven welcomed 
six hundred Hamden students into its schools every day 
as part of an inter-district program. But he said none 
attend Catherine Brennan School in West Rock even 
though it posted the largest testing gains in the district 
last year and is close to Hamden students’ homes.
“You know why?” DeStefano asked. “It’s got a rep.” 
He pointed to a nine-foot-tall map on his wall showing 
the West Rock projects sticking out of New Haven like 
a lonely peninsula. He said the school was a proud place, 
“but because we allow it to be separated and isolated—
particularly from Hamden which surrounds it on three 
sides!—it’s got a rep. It’s not based on a fact, it’s based 
on an ignorance.”
The fence kept Hamden from getting to know the 
school; its physical isolation reinforced its bad reputa­
tion. The school’s reputation, in turn, reinforced its 
isolation, keeping Hamden students away even as the 
school made gains. As long as the fence remained, 
homes would be harder to fill and crime more likely to 
rise. Suddenly the projects’ reputation becomes reality 
and Hamden has a reason to stay away.
DeStefano said Hamden residents don’t know 
about life on the other side of the fence because they 
don’t want to know. “They’re getting to keep their fears 
because they are refusing to hear anything else. It’s how 
we could kill each other in the name of a loving God. 
All over the world.”
 “Look at Israel right now,” DeStefano continued. 
Israel and Gaza, kept separate by a blockade, had just 
completed seven days of fighting in which six Israelis 
and 158 Palestinians were killed. “People and missiles 
can go over fences,” he said. “Ultimately you’ve got 
to solve the problem of making sure you have healthy 
communities.” DeStefano saw fences not as a response 
to crime, but fundamentally as a response to unhealthy 
communities. Crime doesn’t emerge out of thin air; it 
grows out of deeper problems like unemployment, poor 
infrastructure, and too few jobs and resources. DeSte­
fano said fences only intensify animosities. “If you leave 
that fence up with this new community going in there, 
you’re sending a direct message about how I feel about 
you.”
DeStefano cited recent efforts by the New Haven 
Housing Authority to redevelop housing projects like 
Quinnipiac Terrace and Monterrey Place as evidence 
that mixed-income developments reduced crime and im­
proved community life. Hamden’s Police Chief, Thomas 
Wydra, agreed, calling the fence “failed public policy,” a 
symbol “none of us should be proud of.” He told me 
the fence makes crime reduction more difficult. Dead 
ends attract criminals who like operating out of sight. 
Police response times improve without the fence.
DeStefano said the fence reminded him of Jim 
Crow laws, but didn’t think people would soon see it 
with the same starkness. “I don’t think anyone’s going to 
be embarrassed by it,” he said. The fence, he seemed to 
recognize, was based in complicated class prejudices that 
were harder to interpret than their racial antecedents.
“Why do people hold onto their fears and ignoranc­
es?” DeStefano asked. He said economically insecure 
Hamden residents wanted to feel superior to lower-class 
residents of the projects. But, he continued, everyone 
has the same self-interest in healthy communities. Ide­
ally, the projects would improve, the fence would fall, 
and Hamden would benefit from new commerce. But 
neither community will get there without exposing itself 
to injury. Hamden has to trust New Haven to build a 
better project. New Haven has to trust Hamden to open 
its borders in good faith. Both communities will have to 
let old wounds heal in full public view.
 “It means we’re going to have to take chances on 
one another. How is that different from falling into a 
relationship with another person? You take a risk.”
From the Ribicoff projects in New Haven, Mark 
Grant, thirty-four, understands why people won’t take 
risks. He stood on a grassy hill picking leaves out of 
his two-year-old son Israel’s cornrows. Thick clumps of 
hair stuck out from his head and scars rested above both 
eyebrows. 
“This is checkers,” Grant told me. “Everybody 
got a bunch of kings on the board jumping all over the 
place. You don’t want your king to get lost, so you go 
jump him way over here so I can’t take him no more. I’m 
gonna move mine because I’m not gonna let you take 
mine. So we’re sitting here with a bunch of kings moving 
around trying not to get jumped.”
Nobody was willing to expose himself. Each 
hoarded his wealth. Mike Hutsell couldn’t let down his 
guard until New Haven built a better project. New Ha­
ven couldn’t build a better project until Mike Hutsell let 
down his guard. 
Grant continued: “It’s detrimental because now I 
feel like this” – he pointed towards Hamden – “is more 
sacred than this. You get the children underdeveloped 
over here because of how strongly these people feel 
about them. Now they feel alienated, segregated, be­
littled.”
Grant wiped away the last shreds of leaf from Is­
rael’s cornrows. “Keep everything off your head. Don’t 
put anything on your head, man,” he pleaded kindly.
“You’re talking about generational wealth and gen­
erational curses,” Grant said. “This right here represents 
a generational curse.”
I asked him what sort of curse the fence represents.
“You can be president one day,” Grant taunted sar­
castically. “The kids can’t appreciate that. That’s what it 
represents because now you talk about your parents and 
grandparents saying to our parents and grandparents, 
‘Your children can’t come amongst our children. You 
can’t ride up the street and see our holiday decorations 
when the snow falls.’”
I asked Grant about his neighbors, women who, like 
a number of other residents of the projects, told me 
they wanted to let the fence be. “If we care about our 
mothers, give them what they need. They need it down. 
So we broaden them.” The fence, he suggested, needs to 
come down because some people in Ribicoff aren’t sure 
whether it should come down or not. That’s the project 
life that Candace Jones lamented, a life so thoroughly 
integrated into the oppressive ideology of its power bro­
kers that people don’t care whether they can walk on the 
same streets as the privileged, catch the same buses to 
the same shopping malls and the same schools.
The simplest recipe for prosperity, Grant said, was 
to open the border. People would move freely, crime 
would fall, and Hamden would become a more desirable 
location. 
Yet some mixture of hate and fear – not quite 
of race or class but of a lifestyle terrifying in its quiet 
subjugation to the nasty, inertial laws of a life of pov­
erty – maintained the divide. In Hamden, the hate was 
coded in concerns over traffic and shootings. Elsewhere 
in America, it might take the form of a zoning regula­
tion mandating a Spanish tile roof that adds $30,000 to 
construction costs. Or a minimum one acre zoning or­
dinance. Everywhere were erected invisible walls to hold 
poverty at a distance. 
What, in the fall of 2012, kept this tiny, fractured 
community from mending its wounds? Racial integra­
tion had won in Hamden; a black mayor was elected. 
Smart housing policy had won in New Haven; the proj­
ects were being rebuilt. But the fence remained. Its mon­
strous metal sliced open two communities to expose 
prejudices not less nasty than 1960s-era racism thriving 
on the weak minds of angry men, preying on the holy 
heads of innocent boys.

In some ways, Hamden and New Haven are 
locked in a battle more complex than previous genera­
tions knew. Hate has entangled itself in the homes of 
the black Hutsells and the white Masseys without regard 
for color or class. Old hatreds have been encoded in a 
language of crime and government handouts, language 
becoming more inscrutable the more it’s used. Mayor 
Jackson and Mayor DeStefano fight villains that are dif­
ficult to name. Walls multiply and hope loses to fear.

I 
asked Mayor Jackson to visit the fence with me on a 
cold Thursday morning. He’d been tiring of talking 
about the fence, and I hoped visiting it would reawaken 
his resolve. I was wrong. “I’ve already used up my an­
nual allotment of emotion on the fence,” he said when 
we arrived. The only memory he could stir was of the 
one time he’d seen someone crawl out of the projects 
through the fence. It wasn’t a thief or drug dealer. It had 
been a black woman in a business suit, made up as if 
heading to work, leaving through a hole in the pre-2005 
fence.
As Jackson and I spoke, a woman who lived on 
Thorpe Drive, across from the fence in Hamden, 
stopped her Jeep as she drove by and leaned out an open 
window. “Mayor Jackson, when we had that meeting 
about the fence and it was a big uproar, I want to say 
that I really did respect your honesty.” Jackson, bundled 
in two jackets, was taken aback. Jackson knew the wom­
an supported the fence, and had appeared ready for a 
confrontation. Instead, the woman explained that she 
had four kids and she had put herself through nursing 
school, but could still identify with people in the proj­
ects. “If I lost a month’s worth of pay check,” she said, 
gesturing towards New Haven, “I could easily be on that 
side of the fence.”
Jackson thanked the woman as she drove away, 
shining a bit from the praise. “For a moment – for a 
moment – she had faith in somebody,” he told me. “At 
some point, I will capitalize on that. We will capitalize on 
that.” In that moment, the thin line between the impulse 
to reach out and the impulse to lash out –between scared 
people trusting someone and scared people hurting 
someone – appeared to shift towards trust. Two com­
munities seemed to rest in the balance as one woman 
reached over the fence.

The Have Cave has always been a city of connection, since even before its Puritan times. People pair up here 
constantly—for the night, for a year, and, not infrequently, for their lives. It can happen in a freshman entryway or at 
Toad’s, and in Claire’s Corner Copia or on the Green. But these can also be, and often are, momentary couplings. The 
following poems are entries on the “missed connections” section of the New Haven Craigslist page from November, 
with added line breaks and titled by listing headings. 

Guy with dad at Yale Hospital
I saw you in the waiting room with your dad, 
I believe he had an oxygen tank. He said, 
“I’m a regular here” to a woman talking to 
the both of you in a wheelchair. We made 
eye contact a few times, you had brown hair that 
went around your eyebrows. 
oh. wow.
well then 
let’s not talk of love 
or chains 
or things we can’t untie 

better yet, 
let›s not forget 
how much cooler it would have been 
had i met you at 28 
and not 18. 
or if there were only 
a 12-year age difference and 
not a twenty-plus difference. 


Waiter at Miya’s Sushi
To the cute waiter 
at Miya’s sushi 
I hope you see this!
(We made a lot of 
eye contact but 
I was with my friend and 
I didn’t want to be rude.)


Missed you at the meeting
Saw you at the technology meeting yesterday. 
Sitting along the wall, you had a blue shirt and 
dark pants while I had short hair and was dressed in 
a tan shirt and sipped a small coffee, seated with 
the group on the large table. I could hardly 
keep myself from looking at you the whole time 
which was likely obvious to you. We walked 
out the door together but I missed the chance to 
speak to you even as we walked down the hall 
next to each other. I followed you down the stairs 
and as you exited the building we separated. 
We appear to be partners in related organizations 
and I would really like to find out who you are. 
I can’t seem to stop thinking about you.

10AM most weekdays. I walk by. 
Most of the warm days you were outside and 
we said hello. Occasionally a brief conversation. 
Sometimes I thought that perhaps you were 
waiting for me. 

But now it is cold and you are 
working inside. Makes sense to me. I see you but 
I don’t get to say hello. If you would like 
we could meet somewhere after work. 
A drink or some coffee. We could say hello. 

One time you mentioned your weekend job. 
Let me know what that is so I know it is you.

The archery range was eerily quiet.  Usually buzzing with activity, today only a few stray arrows lay scattered on the grass.  I should have known better than to come on a Tuesday.


My aim has been off lately.  My usual bullseye precision feels miles away.  Frustration gnaws at me.  I've tried everything: new bows, different arrows, even meditation.  Nothing seems to work.


Perhaps it's more than just my aim. Perhaps it's the pressure.  Perhaps it's something deeper.




**Title: Ode to a Forgotten Toy**
**Author:  Robert Frost**

In the attic's dust, a soldier sleeps,
His painted coat, a faded hue.
Once proud, he stood, his secrets deep,
Now silent, still, and born anew.


His wooden limbs, once strong and bold,
Now brittle, weak, a fallen king.
A tale untold, a story old,
A childhood's joy, his silent spring.
