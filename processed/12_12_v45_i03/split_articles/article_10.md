Public Health as Health Educator (1986-1990) and then 
became the city’s Public Health Director (1990-2010).
Triffin, who received his Master’s in Public Health 
from Yale School of Public Health in 1984, has secured 
West Haven hundreds of thousands of dollars in state 
and federal grants for everything from a “Childhood 
Immunization Registry and Tracking System” to “Bio-
terrorism and Emergency Response Preparation.” He 
implemented West Haven’s lead poisoning and childhood 
immunization programs, as well as initiatives to lower 
infant mortality in the area. He’s 
written at least nine opinion 
pieces and letters to the editor in 
the New Haven Register over the 
years, as well innovative public 
health essays such as: “Food-a-
Go-Go School Cafeterias: State 
of the Art Centers for Excellence 
in Nutrition and Hygiene.” On 
their 
350th 
anniversary, 
Yale 
School of Public Health awarded 
him a place on the Public Health 
Community Service Honor Roll. 
New England Division of the 
American Cancer Society has 
recognized him as “one of the 
most influential persons in the fight against tobacco 
during the last 25 years.” To top it all off, he’s fluent in 
three languages — French, English and Italian — and 
has a foothold in Spanish, Russian, and Sanskrit.


It’s an impressive resume, one that reflects what 
Robert Kilpatrick ventured to call Triffin’s “anything 
but disconnected” style. According to Kilpatrick, who 
worked for over thirty-five years with the Cornell Scott 
Hill-Health Center, it was this holistic approach to 
public health that brought Triffin to bat for the center 
when they struggled to open a branch in downtown 
West Haven back in 1995. A number of city council 
members were resisting Hill-Health’s proposal. “There 
was all this concern that there would be drug addicts 
lined up at the clinic door, causing a nuisance in the 
neighborhood,” Kilpatrick tells me. As West Haven’s 
liaison with Hill-Health and a staunch advocate of the 
clinic, Triffin was appalled. When he spoke about it, his 
voice lost its usual whimsy and his eyes narrowed. “It 
was unfathomable. These were sick people who needed 
healthcare.” Ultimately, Triffin successfully applied to 
have West Haven identified as a medically underserved 
area; a high-need, low-income designation that helped 
garner the funding and recognized the urgency for Hill-
Health to set up a clinic on Main Street.


Triffin’s work has not lacked style; Borer has called it 
the “Triffin School of Public Health.” Chuckling fondly, 
Borer recalled how Triffin started doing outreach from 
a Volkswagen bus. A card-carrying vegan, Triffin began 
driving to local festivals, farmers markets and exhibitions 
in the bus, where he would don his “Carrotman” or 
“Snappy the Peace Pod” costumes to promote healthy 
living. It’s a tradition he eventually brought to the West 
Haven Green when he started their first farmer’s market, 
and one he continues to this day. “May peas be with you, 
may peas be with you,” he beams, almost manically, as he 
hands out snap peas to passersby. 
“Now you may have peas within,” 
he says, and then, swirling around, 
”You too can create whirled 
peas.” He ends with one final 
addendum, which he delivers with 
a hint of self-satisfaction: “But 
I’m just a hip-pea.”


Kilpatrick remembers Triffin 
in the midst of an ultimately 
successful 
campaign 
to 
ban 
smoking in public places in the 
state of Connecticut. “I was at 
the capital in Hartford at this 
conference, and when Eric’s 
turn to make a statement came, 
he went up and burst into song.” He laughs. “He had 
changed the words of…I’m pretty sure it was ‘Who let 
the dogs out?’” Triffin’s approach offered a proactive 
and creative influence against a material culture in which, 
Triffin argues, “We’re infecting kids with bad [choices]. 
Advertising is a vector for chronic disease.” 
According to Borer, Triffin’s was a user-friendly 
approach that attracted people’s attention not only in a 
way they would remember, but in a way that would work. 
“Eric’s very wise,” Borer tells me. “He’s the type of 
person who could communicate anything to just about 
anybody, whether it was some high-ranking official from 
the state of Connecticut or the federal government or it 
was a single mom on the streets who needed assistance.” 
I can confirm this — Triffin, very effectively, explained 
the digestive system to me by starting with the assertion 
that a person is a lot like a donut. 


As Borer puts it, “[his approach] wasn’t ivy-tower 
stuffy intellect, but a very down-to-earth, folksy, ‘this 
is how we’re going to get people healthy’ form of 
innovative brilliance.” And, he added, the nation should 
use this grounded innovation in the burgeoning field of 
public health. He recalls an old mantra of Triffin’s: “it’s 
more of what’s happening between your hands that will 
hurt you more than anything else that’s going on in the 
world.” 
While Triffin claims 
that dancing is what 
he’s doing when he feels 
most alive, he knows 
what it means to 
“bring home the tofu.”


When Triffin reflects on his unconventional 
approach to the role of Public Health Director, the 
deliberative nature of his genius shines through. “I may 
look like a fish out of water,” he admits, “but I’m more 
like a Shakespearean fool.”


I 
meet with Triffin on a chilly October afternoon at 
Edge of  the Woods, a vegetarian health food market 
on Whalley Avenue where he does twice-weekly food 
demonstrations — on this particular day he’s making hot 
malt cider. After a quick lap around the store, I spot him 
at the end of the gluten-free aisle with a fresh tray. It’s 
a natural fit for Triffin, who got his start in nutrition 
— in the seventies, he started New Haven’s first food 
co-op and a vegetarian restaurant with his brother Kerry 
called “Down to Earth.” For him, the appeal of the 
store has a lot to do with freedom — “freedom from 
mega food corporations, freedom from killing animals, 
freedom from packaging, labeling, advertising, and 
preservatives…” He does a little jig as he explains to 
a shopper (miraculously without a spill). “Why not live 
lighter, closer to the sun, and with less of a footprint?” 
Graphic design student Benjamin Niznik MFA ’14 
catches up to Triffin just before I do. “Eric! I’m doing 
this project and I want you to participate.” He peels a 
softball-sized orange sticker off a sheet and asks Triffin 
to wear it. “The project is all about health and positive 
energy,” he explains to me later. “That’s Eric, in essence. 
The oranges are the equivalent of a virtual liking system 
in reality.”


Later, Triffin and I sit in the bakery café, sipping 
cider while he reflects on nearly six decades in New 
Haven. His narrative unfolds tangent by tangent, never 
lacking in intrigue or personal charm. With the exception 
of first grade in Paris and sixth grade in Rome, Eric grew 
up in New Haven, graduating from the Hopkins School 
in 1969 — the same year he attended “3 Days of Peace 
& Music” at Woodstock. His was a large, liberal family. 
Wearing his “Snappy the Peace Pod” costume, Triffin holds up snap peas at Edge of  the Woods Natural Market. 


“I think I was 5 or 6 years old, building fall out shelters,” 
Triffin recalls, his blue eyes lighting up as he ventures 
back into his memory. “My mother was teaching yoga 
to paraplegics in a cool atelier in Paris in the forties, and 
feeding us carrot juice and wheat germ and growing 
sprouts in the fifties and sixties. She was sort of on the 
spiritual side.” Triffin’s father, meanwhile, was Belgian 
economist and Yale professor Robert Triffin, who 
first proposed implementing a common currency to 
unite Europe. “My father was a monk in economist’s 
clothing,” Triffin laughs. “He always said ‘unity creates 
peace.’ He dissolved borders that had been fought over 
for hundreds of years.”


Eric recalls dinner table 
debates in the Triffin household 
where The New York Times was 
always on the kitchen table. “My 
mother was kind of on one side 
— very touchy, softy — and my 
father was on the other — more 
organized and theoretical.” The 
discussions drove Eric to seek 
out a middle ground, much 
like the one his career in public 
health seemed to epitomize. 
His story is interrupted 
when a woman slides a business 
card across our table as she exits 
the café. On the back, she’s 
written a note asking Triffin 
to call her about speaking for 
a Sierra Bridge Club event 
to protest a coal plant in 
Bridgeport. A few minutes 
later, another graphic design student approaches, 
asking Triffin to discuss MSG for a film she’s making. 
“You’re the third student to hit on me now,” Triffin jests. 
“Somebody else just gave me a card for a photography 
gig!” In September, Triffin made his music video debut 
in Tori Amos’ “Flavor” video. Eric-fever is rampant. 


“I 
ended up in Public Health,” Triffin levels, “because 
it was public and healthy, and not about working 
for the man.” 


Triffin’s life philosophy is one of wellness and 
community, decidedly nurturing of freedom, knowledge, 
and love — not necessarily convention. “I’m all about 
cooking two casseroles in one oven, not killing two birds 
with one stone,” he tells me. It’s a simple and honest 
philosophy that seems to perfectly reconcile “Eric the 
TranscenDancer” with Eric the Health Director. 


Given Triffin’s pacifism — he’s gone so far as to 
excise all “violent” language from his vocabulary — he 
was frustrated by what he perceived to be a “militaristic” 
shift in the field of public health after 9/11, marking a 
turning point in his career. As the wars in Afghanistan 
and Iraq gave rise to concerns of bioterrorism, the pro-
wellness, grassroots initiatives that had long characterized 
Triffin’s work were sidelined. “There would be powdered 
sugar on the street…and all of the sudden Eric would 
have to be dealing with anthrax,” Borer recounts. When 
I ask Triffin about this, he groans as he reminisces 
on “the absurd idea that Saddam would be infecting 
us with smallpox.” The Public Health Director’s job 
description seemed to include new defense initiatives, 
like establishing a position of 
Homeland Security Coordinator 
for West Haven and leading 
emergency 
preparedness 
exercises in the community. 


Triffin became uncomfortable 
with 
the 
work, 
ultimately 
viewing it as an alarmist 
extension of a war effort he 
could not bring himself to 
support. His feeling was that 
the only effective way to disarm 
violence would be through 
promoting health. We should 
have been “exporting tractors…
building wells and desalinization 
plants,” he explains.


Triffin’s 
disenchantment 
was evident to Borer, too. “I 
could always tell when Eric 
wasn’t 
buying 
something,” 
Borer tells me, “because he would suddenly get very 
quiet, purse his lips, and just sit there. That’s the closest 
thing to a negative reaction you’ll ever get out of Eric… 
I could tell he was frustrated.” Ultimately, the Director 
handed in his resignation to the Department of Public 
Health in 2010. There are certain fevers Triffin cannot 
pass on. After all, he explains, “when you show up at a 
bioterrorism conference dressed as a giant carrot, there 
are people that simply don’t approve.”


Nowadays, Triffin has put a new twist on his work, 
focusing mainly on outreach and “edutainment” as he 
continues his twenty-five year side career as an adjunct 
Professor of Public Health, Wellness and Nutrition at 
Southern Connecticut State University. “For twenty-five 
years I contained contagion,” he says, dancing along to 
his own words with hand gestures. “Now I’m trying to 
spread contagions of caring and infect people with good 
health. Good food, good music, good energy, good 
His feeling was that the 
only effective way to 
disarm violence would 
be through promoting 
health. We should have 
been “exporting tractors…
building wells and 
desalinization plants,” he 
explained.
