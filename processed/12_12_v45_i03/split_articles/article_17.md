Development, is “an abandoned, idled, or underused 
property where expansion or redevelopment is 
complicated by the presence or potential presence of 
contamination.”  The Government Accountability 
Office estimates that as many as 425,000 brownfields 
exist in the US. 

Redeveloping brownfields can provide economic 
benefits. According to the website of the EPA, 
brownfield redevelopment has created over 5,500 jobs 
in the 2012 fiscal year alone. To that extent, New Haven 
sees English Station as an economic opportunity.  

New Haven has partnered with a local economic 
development organization to facilitate economic growth 
along the Mill River. The city may be interested in 
including English Station in specific plans in the future, 
said Tony Bialecki, deputy economic development 
director for the City of New Haven. 

However, because of the current 
environmental issues, the city has 
not been able to develop a strategy 
for addressing it.

Preserving 
the 
building 
as a historic site might also be 
economically 
beneficial. 
John 
Herzan, preservation services officer 
for the New Haven Preservation 
Trust, said that he hopes English 
Station can be placed on the national 
register of historic places. “We hope 
that this designation would provide 
economic incentives for reusing the 
building rather than demolishing it,” 
he said.

Residents would also like to see English Station 
brought back to life. Aaron Goode, who is on the steering 
committee of the EJN, said that English Station “fell on 
hard times, like the rest of New Haven. I sincerely hope 
that it can also be part of New Haven’s renaissance.”

But he qualified that statement, adding that this is 
possible “if we do the right kind of intervention.”

T
he first time Randall entered English Station, 
he wanted to get onto the roof. He went up 
with a friend, and took some sunset pictures.

As it got dark, Randall decided that it was time to 
come down. But he couldn’t find the way out.

“There’s really no logical sequence to get from 
one floor to another,” Randall said, speaking about one 
particular section of the building. “I was using my flash 
as a strobe to see. It took us forty-five minutes but we 
found our way out.”

TNJ
Randall is lucky that it only took him minutes to get 
out; it has taken me on the order of a hundred hours 
(and nearly as many phone calls), and I still haven’t found 
my way out. Some of the other actors haven’t been 
able to get out for years and years. The current owners 
have held the property the six years and counting, and 
residents have been saddled with the toxic site for much 
longer.

The toxicity of the site comes not only from its 
physical contaminants. The property is also contaminated 
with rumors that have been accepted as truth, a history 
of miscommunication, and a general lack of accurate 
information. Confusion amongst the official actors – 
the local, city, state, and private entities – trickles down, 
leaving the public puzzled and therefore frustrated. The 
complicated interplay between actors leaves everyone 
with a complete and accurate 
picture of the situation.

With his DSLR camera, 
Randall 
captured 
several 
different exposures of the same 
scene using slightly different 
settings. He then layered the 
photos on top of each other 
using a digital image editing 
program, with a process called 
high dynamic range imaging.

“You’re basically able to 
emphasize 
or 
deemphasize 
certain components or features 
of those exposures in the final 
image,” Randall said. 

“I guess it’s a philosophical thing whether or not 
that’s an actual representation of reality or not,” Randall 
said. “To me, it is. To me, the process adds something 
that wasn’t there. To me, it almost makes it look more 
real.”

Randall’s photographs depict English Station 
as a dilapidated industrial graveyard and Shapiro’s 
photographs show a once clean building. Just as it is 
hard to believe that they were photographing the same 
building, different people tell me stories that, while not 
necessarily opposing, appear to contradict each other.

Randall’s photographs present an eerie, unsettling 
view of reality. But, as McAllister and Regan described, 
English Station was not what it first appeared to them 
to be.
