to describe the connection between home invasions and 
people in the projects, she hesitated, her nervous eyes 
searching the ceiling. She stammered: “Someone that is 
of another culture or another, I don’t know how to say 
this respectfully – someone being thuggish – has this 
idea, ‘Oh, if I rob this person I can make money.’ That’s 
crazy.”

When I asked her what troubled her about the 
projects, Marilyn didn’t seem most concerned about 
physical crime. Instead, she complained about “people 
in grocery stores with food stamps and you know they 
don’t need them.” She said people invented hardships 
to hoard handouts and turned down jobs to qualify for 
free oil. She seemed almost to be replaying the critique 
of “welfare queens” that Ronald Reagan delivered in his 
1976 campaign, poor blacks cheating the middle class 
of their wealth. Working-class Marilyn was a rung above 
those black people.

Marilyn’s fear of thugs and food stamps wasn’t 
far from a caricature of anti-poor prejudice, but it also 
wasn’t far from human. Like many middle-class Ameri­
cans, the Hutsells say their work doesn’t guarantee them 
the comfort it once did. For the first time since the 
1920s, median family income has dropped substantially 
over a decade. Family income last year was eight percent 
lower than it had been in 2000, compared to what is usu­
ally a thirty percent rise during eleven-year periods. The 
Hutsells are worried with reason, delaying retirement 
while they watch tax dollars go to the poor.

But the Hutsells’ argument was still aggressive and 
apocryphal. In their minds, food stamps weren’t a con­
sequence of economic decline. They became the cause

of that decline. The middle class wasn’t struggling be­
cause globalization and automation were raising demand 
for skills and pushing down pay. Social programs for the 
poor were driving middle-class hardship.

The Hutsells saw poor people as perpetrators in 
this system. They weren’t poor by circumstance, but be­
cause of insufficient work ethic, a condemnation almost 
as permanent as one based on race or ethnicity. The kind 
of person who chose to be poor deserve to be fenced 
in. As Marilyn said, “If you don’t want to get a job and 
you want to live in low-income housing, that’s on you.”

But people like the Hutsells were intensifying New 
Haven residents’ dependency, stranding them on a 
walled-in peninsula far from jobs and public services. I 
asked Marilyn how she’d respond to people in the proj­
ects who felt penned in. “If that fence makes you feel 
insecure, then you come and live where middle class 
America lives. On the other side of that fence. And you 
take on some of the responsibilities that middle class 
America has taken on and cherishes.”

The Hutsells at their home in Hamden.


Jackson isn’t unaware of the Hutsells’ fears. Back 
in his office, he told me the difference between Ham­
den and New Haven is stark. Hamden residents have 
spent years getting up for work every morning. Life in 
the projects, where jobs come and go and apathy and an­
ger reign, is hard to imagine. But Jackson said Hamden 
had a choice.

“Do you establish public policy out of fear or out 
of hope?”

I
n the newly redesigned Brookside projects in New 
Haven, brightly colored homes are still being built. 
Sidewalks, trees, and spaces between homes have been 
planned to make the projects safer and friendlier. One 
hundred subsidized housing units are already occupied, 
along with two home-ownership units. Omar Ursini, 41, 
a new resident, was hopeful about the changed commu­
nity but worried the fence would obstruct growth. “It’s a 
cage,” he said. “That’s all it is.”

In practical terms, the fence terrifies Leslie Creane, 
Hamden’s town planner. She worries Brookside will 
have more difficulty filling 
its middle-income units and 
home-ownership 
units 
as 
long as the fence stands, 
keeping poverty concentrated 
and raising risks of crime. 
Connected streets are also 
safer streets. In the case 
of an accident or tornado, 
emergency 
vehicles 
from 
Hamden would reach the 
projects faster without a fence.

The New Haven Housing 
Authority built the West Rock projects in the 50s after 
more desirable public housing plots were exhausted. In 
fact, the land on which the projects were built was once 
Hamden property. On maps, it looks as if someone cut 
into Hamden’s otherwise smooth border with a scalpel 
and heaped the dirty plot into New Haven. The land 
had been a pig farm before the projects were built, 
undesirable from the start. “New Haven clearly found 
the most remote corner to put lots of poor people,” 
Creane said.

By 1992, unemployment was 88 percent in Rock­
view and 76 percent in Brookside. Jesse Phillips, whose 
aunt lived in the old Brookside, told me as a kid he 
found bodies lying in the road. Ursini, the Brookside 
resident, said residents in the old Rockview rolled dump­
sters filled with burning trash into the street so police 
couldn’t get inside. 

Bus routes used to stop passing through the proj­
ects at 5 p.m. Even now, Creane asked, do residents want 
to risk getting home late from work and walking from 
the bus stop to their homes down a haunting stretch of 
dead end road? “It’s a perfectly plausible survival skill. 
This has nothing to do with not wanting to work. This 
has to do with infrastructure and public policy deliber­
ately conspiring against you.”

In Westville Manor, a public housing project farther 
from the fence in West Rock, drug deals still happen on 
the purple playground slide. Candace Jones, who helps 
run a youth organization there called Solar Youth, has 
had her offices broken into three times this year. When 
a New Haven police officer arrived to respond to one 
break-in, he told Jones, “I don’t even know why you 
help these people. Don’t you know who you’re work­
ing with?” She said buses are often late and the drivers 
don’t seem to care. After all, people in the projects have 
nowhere to be.

Jones recounted a conversation with an eleven-year-
old student who had been excited to join the local drill 
team, but decided not to try out. The girl’s reason? “My 
mom has applied to so many jobs 
and she doesn’t get any. I’m not go­
ing to get it either.” Jones said she 
wished it was as simple as ‘just get 
up and get a job,’ as the Hutsells de­
mand. But hopelessness is infectious, 
and dreams shrivel quickly. She said 
children in the projects don’t have 
the “drive that I can get out there 
and be somebody” because they are 
confronted with barriers, not oppor­
tunities.

F
rom the back doors of their homes on Thorpe 
Drive in Hamden, residents can walk six steps and 
touch the fence. Harvey Massey, 73, and his wife Miriam, 
72, white residents of Thorpe, opened the first door I 
knocked on. They spoke to me through their screen 
door, but knew what I wanted. “I’ve been broken into 
four times and robbed twice,” Harvey said immediately, 
as if reading a script all of Hamden knew. He said the 
crimes took place in the seventies.

“It’s not like we’re all white, but we’ve all worked for 
what we have,” he said when I asked what distinguished 
people in Hamden from people in the projects. “We de­
serve security, we deserve the comfort of being in our 
homes without someone breaking in.” Harvey told me 
he grew up in the Brookside projects and didn’t want to 
let that way of life into Hamden.

I was confronted with the same attitude that ap­
peared in the Hutsells’ dining room, but this time I didn’t 
“In the civil rights era, 
you didn’t allow folks to 
figure out on their own 
how not to be racist.”
