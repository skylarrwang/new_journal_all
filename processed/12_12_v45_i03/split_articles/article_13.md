EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Clare gets to have a lot more sleepovers than before 
because the house is much more spacious than her 
old one in East Rock. When her friends come over on 
Saturday nights, they watch movies and talk and play, 
and marvel at the floor-to-ceiling glass windows on the 
lower level of the house that reflect the image of the 
living room at night. But her peers are conscious of the 
oddness of her home. “They think it’s cool, but they 
wouldn’t want to do it,” Clare said. 


Having people in your house so much of the time 
takes some getting used to. A self-proclaimed dog 
person, Clare uses her new puppy, Toller, to help her 
integrate into social situations with older people. Her 
mom has noticed. “It helps her to feel like she has a 
role if she’s taking care of him in this context of a busy 
party,” Hungerford said.


Clare learns a lot from the guests and students she 
meets, but knows that she occupies a strange space at 
Yale. She’s not a peer, not a friend, but rather a fixture 
of Morse life. “Yale students are nice,” she said. “I kind 
of talk to them. But they talk more to each other.” 


Ultimately, this place is a club to which she is occasionally 
given elite access and from which she is also occasionally 
barred.


That boundary between Clare and Yale students 
even exists for seventeen-year-old Kate Bradley, daughter 
of Branford Master Elizabeth Bradley, despite her 
involvement in campus activities. She plays intramural 
squash for Branford, uses the library and the gym, 
goes out to New Haven restaurants for dinner with her 
brother, and gets advice from Yale students about what 
to study and what college life is really like, but Kate still 
knows that there is an invisible gulf between herself and 
the average Yalie. “A lot of students are only one year 
older than me, but it feels like there is such a difference 
between us,” she said. 


During his seven years living in the Morse Master’s 
house, Keil took full advantages of those boundaries. 
He said any student who happened to see him walking 
around Morse when he lived there would have thought 
of him as that “quiet Master’s kid.” He isolated himself 
from Yale student life, choosing instead to focus on the 
trajectory of his own life; it took him until senior year 
of high school to learn how to get to Old Campus from 
Morse. 


His world felt a little more normal than many 
Master’s kids’ because most of his friends at Hopkins 
School were also connected to Yale. His good friend 
Joe Schottenfeld ’12, son of Davenport Master Richard 
Schottenfeld, is exactly Marty’s age. Joe had his bar 
mitzvah party in the Davenport dining hall. Marty had his 
eighth grade graduation after-dance in his living room. It 
was an unusual way to grow up, but they normalized the 
experience for each other.


At fourteen years old, Marty told the Yale Daily News 
that he was “definitely tired of Yale,” but now admits 
in retrospect that he did not really know the University 
until Bulldog Days, when he thought about it as a college 
option for the first time. 


Clare is adamant about not wanting to go to Yale for 
college. “If I stay in one place and experience everything 
I have all over again, it’s not really a completely new 
experience or getting away from mom and dad,” she 
reasoned. Clare already overhears students stressing 
about midterms and congratulating each other on 
consulting jobs. She sees fliers for information sessions 
about studying in China and running HIV clinics in 
Ecuador. And she hears her mom get out of bed at 
2 a.m. to break up parties, knowing that students are 
outside behaving in ways that she has been taught not 
to behave. 


Amy Hungerford is not too worried about Clare 
observing those moments. “I am sort of fearless about 
knowledge in children,” Hungerford said. “There’s an 
occasion to talk about what they’re learning and seeing 
in the world.” These conversations happen very openly 
in Kate’s family as well. “When we talk about it, my 
parents treat me like an adult,” she said. 


Since Bajwa is raising his children in the Muslim 
faith, which prohibits drinking, college partying will 
eventually call for serious conversations as Yaqub and 
Aya get older. But those discussions are still a long ways 
off. “I think if my kids were teenagers and they were 
seeing kids partying on Friday nights, that would have 
been more worrisome for me,” Bajwa said.


The kids of Yale see hundreds of examples of 
ways to be in the world while growing up here. These 
kids are imagining how they will navigate their college 
experiences and, like the students, learning how to mold 
the people they will become. 


As Yaqub and I walked out of the dining hall after 
dinner, he pointed to the lit windows around the TD 
courtyard to show me where all of his friends live. 
He’s seen some of their rooms multiple times. He was 
sad that I had to leave, but he wanted to know what 
residential college I was in. Although he hadn’t heard of 
Morse before, when I mentioned that it was right next to 
Stiles, his eyes lit up. “My family eats in Stiles all the time. 
Maybe I’ll see you there at dinner again.” Just like any 
Yalie, Yaqub has learned how to organize his social life 
around meals. I’m sure I’ll see him there soon, stealthily 
carrying a plate of French fries to his seat before his 
parents can stop him, and beaming with pride every time 
a friend puts out a hand to give him a low-five.
