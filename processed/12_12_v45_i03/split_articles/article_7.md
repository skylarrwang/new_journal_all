Half of the New Haven Register press building, still 
occupied by the newspaper’s reporters and administrative 
staff, hums with fluorescent lights and muffled typing. 

But in the printing area, the rooms are gapingly empty. 
One room holds rows and rows of the Register’s 
characteristic red curbside newspaper dispensers. 
Arranged in tight lines, they stand like grave-markers. 
The two presses loom in another room; they stand two-
stories tall, as huge and silent as two dinosaur skeletons 
in a monumental hall. Cylinders that once whirred with 
heavy rolls of newsprint now sit empty. Their stillness 
feels unnatural. 
“When the presses were running, it was a very busy, 
loud, mechanical operation, ” Ed Stannard, a long-time 
Register writer, told me. “When they were moving at top 
speed, there was a lot going on, paper flying through. It 
was very exciting.” The presses ground to a halt in March 
when, in an effort to cut back, the Register outsourced its 
printing from New Haven to a press in Hartford, hoping 
to sell the building and move downtown. 

That is, until recently. For one weekend in October, 
Artspace, a local art venue with exhibition spaces across 
New Haven, filled the press rooms with art for its annual 
Alternative Space weekend. “We try to find a different 
vacant building, and a lot of times we try to find 
something that has some kind of cultural significance 
to New Haven. [Local artists] are interested in breathing 
new life into that and making the place come alive again, 
if only temporarily,” said Open Studios Coordinator JP 
Culligan. 

On October 20 and 21, nearly two thousand 
visitors streamed around the presses, staring up at the 
machinery. Roughly 130 artists from around Connecticut 
contributed work to the show ­— canvases, frames, and 
photographs filled the ink-stained walls with color. In one 
room, the empty newspaper dispensers were arranged 
into paths, guiding visitors from video projection to 
video projection. Push for Fire, a piece by local artist and 
Quinnipiac art professor Greg Garvey, showed a man’s 
bathrobe as it burst into flame. It crumpled into twisted 
black ash. A tie, a jacket,  and a pair of leather shoes 
followed. 

One room later, canvasses were displayed on 
makeshift walls that hung around the printing machinery. 
Visitors ascended a stairwell filled with the singing of 
a young musician who crouched under the stairs, and 
they emerged onto a catwalk that surrounds the presses’ 
upper level. Ellen Hackl Fagan, a Harlem-based artist 
who lives in Connecticut, had provided visitors with  
label makers so they could adorn the presses’ expansive 
control panels. One visitor gleefully printed out labels 
to name one dial “happiness,” and another “madness.” 

The Register hopes that after selling its current 
building, it can move from its fairly remote location on 
Long Wharf Drive to downtown New Haven “where 
we were born, and lived most of our lives,” as reporter 
Ed Stannard told me. The paper has big dreams of 
engaging more directly with the community, making the 
Register a public space with open news meetings and a 
“newsroom cafe.”
But the Register’s current location has been a New 
Haven landmark for many years. David K. Thompson, 
a photographer native to New Mexico, was drawn to 
the possibility of using the Register for an installation. 
“I wanted to interact with the machines themselves,” 
he told me. In his piece, titled Off  Register in reference 
to a printing term for misaligned elements, a video 
projection played on the rhythmic copper slats of one 
of the presses. The metal shone with the light of the 
projector and a film of people moving shone on its 
surface. Artifacts of communication sat in front of the 
press — antennas, stacked television screens displaying 
static, speakers blaring mechanical noise, and a thick 
book bolted shut. 

“The main motivation of this piece was to add a 
reanimation to the machinery here . . . to show some 
movement in there when the movement’s gone,” 
Thompson explained. 

Some artists, including Thompson, created work 
informed by the decline of print. For Greg Garvey, the 
Register’s resident ghosts were ominous. “In the room 
where the video is being shown, there are all these 
newspaper dispensers, and I made an instant mental 
comparison to one of the final scenes in Citizen Kane, 
when there are all these crates and boxes in his mansion 
after he died,” he told me. 

Noel Sardalla, a local artist, stood in a small, empty 
Register office as visitors to the exhibit streamed in and 
out. One by one, carefully, he threaded paper flowers 
from the floor beside him onto fishing line. Made from 
newsprint, the flowers were delicate and small -- each was 
only a few inches across. The line formed a net, attached 
to the ceiling, that hung a few inches away from the wall. 
The flowers suspended within it seemed to float. The 
piece, titled The Paper It’s Printed On, contained the text of 
hundreds, thousands, of newspaper articles — nutgrafs 
and decks, all folded into one another, swinging gently 
in the air.  The flowers moved slightly in the breeze of 
a visitor who walked by briskly, looking at the phone in 
her hands. 

For a few days, light played across the press again. 
The video room’s projectors threw shifting lights and 
colors onto the walls. Artists stood by their work, heads 
thrown back in laughter or bent in discussion with 
passing visitors. Guests walked by holding wine in a clear 
plastic cup. The rooms were loud, filled with the buzzing 
of conversation and the faint clicks and whirrs of audio 
installations. Faintly, in the background, I imagined I 
could hear the clamor of the presses as they churned 
out paper. “It’s unfortunate to see something like that 
disappear,” Culligan told me, “but at the same time, at 
least we get to throw a going-away party for it.”

**Title: Teaching Tongues**
**Page number(s): 5-6**

In Navajo, the phrase “I want to weigh you” 
translates directly from English into “I want to hang 
you.”

Some elderly members of the Navajo tribe still 
laugh about the old misunderstanding, but for Chris 
Brown ‘15, it represents the need for doctors that speak 
the Native American language.  When he was younger, 
Brown witnessed the poor healthcare his relatives, 
especially his grandmother, received on the reservation 
from doctors who did not speak the language. He 
resolved to return to a Navajo reservation as a doctor 
and help the elderly, many of whom do not speak 
English, receive adequate care.

Navajo is not taught as a language at Yale so Brown 
applied to Directed Independent Language Study, or 
DILS.  DILS offers the opportunity for students to work 
one-on-one with a “language partner,” a native speaker 
that guides them through their independent study of the 
language. For two hours each week, Brown has a Skype 
conversation with his language partner Jolyana Begay, a 
professor at the University of Arizona.

Popular DILS languages are less widely useful than 
languages like Chinese or Spanish, and the languages 
that trend in DILS projects are telling of cultural and 
academic patterns at Yale, in New Haven, and in the 
country as a whole. 

Trends in the popularity of languages taught in 
the classroom evolve slowly in response to changing 
political and economic balances between nations. Only 
the largest political and cultural shifts seem to make a 
mark. The popularity of Russian spiked during the Cold 
War. In the 1990s, students took interest in learning 
Japanese during Japan’s period of economic prosperity. 
More recently, in the post-9/11 era, Arabic has become 
more popular. 

DILS is a sensitive barometer that gauges the 
popularity of lesser-known languages, said Nelleke Van 
Deusen-Scholl, director of the Center for Language 
Study. 

The program is more responsive to micro-trends 
in the interests of the student body, and not necessarily 
sweeping geopolitical trends. After the Haitian 
earthquake, more students wanted to take Haitian 
Creole through DILS. Cantonese is currently one of 
DILS’ popular languages. According to DILS director 
Angela Gleason, a large number of students who grew 
up speaking Cantonese at home who have no other 
way to study the language. On a campus where many 
students are uncertain about their interests, DILS is a 
small, self-selecting program. 

Chelsea Wells ‘13 took Choctaw through DILS 
in the fall of 2011 as a way to connect to her heritage. 
Wells’ motives for learning Choctaw reflects a larger 
trend toward the celebration and conservation of less 
widely spoken languages. Her language partner was a 
woman from her hometown in Oklahoma, and Wells 
said it was great to learn from somebody from the area 
in which the language was spoken.

“Very few young people in the Nation speak 
Choctaw,” Wells explained. Her great-grandfather spoke 
the language, but did not teach it to anybody because 
of stigma against Native American languages. Wells 
views her study of Choctaw as a way to affirm that 
the language is a positive part of the culture. Though 
she says her studies were not necessarily practical, they 
fulfilled her in other ways.

But some do choose languages to match specific 
professional goals. Justin Hunter Scott GRD ’13, an 
African Studies student, took Twi, a Ghanaian language, 
through DILS so he could travel to Ghana if his plans to 
do research in Nigeria did not work out. Similarly, Alexa 
Little ’15 is studying Nepali through DILS with language 
conservation in mind, since she hopes to pursue a career 
conserving endangered languages in villages in the 
Himalayas. 

Gleason also explained that while selection of 
a student for DILS is based on merit, the number of 
students that can be accepted to study each language is 
somewhat dependent on the amount of money set aside 
for that language. European languages like Armenian
