and contamination includes battles between owners and 
local environmental organizations, cleanup attempts 
that have spiraled into stagnation, and an overall lack of 
access to basic knowledge of the situation. 


Local residents are unable to navigate the 
bureaucratic mess, leaving them unaware of risks 
presented to public health and the local environment, 
especially as scavengers distribute contaminated 
materials from the site. The site’s potential hazards 
loom, but little is being done. 


Currently, English Station is off limits to its owners 
and their contractors because of the DEEP’s 
cease and desist order, issued in February. The DEEP 
is currently waiting for John Insall, who works with 
Stantec, a professional consulting service, to draw up a 
remedial action plan, Kaufman said. Kaufman said that 
the owners eventually want to redevelop the building, 
but declined to give specific information.


Most recently, English Station has been in the 
news because 24-year-old New Haven resident Sammy 
Gonzalez was arrested after being electrocuted when 
he cut through a power line at a UI substation at 
English Station. Even though English Station is no 
longer producing electricity, there is still an operational 
substation on the property. Roughly three thousand 
residents of East Rock were without power for three 
hours on November 29, and Gonzalez faces many 
criminal charges.


Dave Hartman, public information officer of the 
New Haven police department (NHPD), said that there 
is an ongoing investigation and that a motive has not 
been identified. According to an NHPD press release, 
Gonzalez “faces several criminal charges including 
burglary, criminal attempt to commit larceny and breach 
of peace in the first degree for the service interruption.” 


II)” in early October, and the New Haven Independent 
published six of those the next day. The newspaper had 
run photographs from his first expedition into English 
Station in March.


The trip into the station was motivated in part by a 
desire to expose its innards to the general public and in 
part by his curiosity. “I wanted to see what it looks like,” 
Randall said. 


“This place is a big part of our historical narrative 
and we deserve the right to see what it looks like.”


A few days after he posted the pictures, he received 
an email from Lori Saliby, a supervising environmental 
analyst at DEEP.  Saliby works with the DEEP’s storage 
tank and PCB enforcement unit. 


“Well, shit, I must be in trouble now,” Randall 
remembered thinking.


Luckily for Randall, he wasn’t in trouble, at least 
not with the government. He was told that his health, 
however, might be in danger. Sailby said that when 
they spoke over the phone about his visit, she told 
him that he had potentially contaminated himself and 
his companions, and that he may have transferred 
contamination off the site. Randall said she seemed 
concerned about his safety. 


Randall was not as concerned. “I guess that’s a risk 
I took,” he said. “Hopefully nothing happens.” The 
owners, however, don’t share his nonchalance.


“What he did was foolish, what he did was 
dangerous,” Uri Kaufman, real estate developer and 
consultant to the owners, said. “It was dangerous to him, 
[and] it was dangerous to others.”


Kaufman told me that the owners filed a criminal 
complaint against Randall for trespassing on the 
property. Randall said that he was unaware of any such 
action.


English Station’s complicated history of ownership 


Hartman said that Gonzalez is in critical condition, 
and is being treated for burns from electrocution. He 
said that, given the difficulty of accessing burn victims, 
it would be a while before they can establish a motive. 
The interview process has not yet begun.


However, 
Hartman 
speculated 
about 
what 
Gonzalez’s intentions might have been. He said that it 
might have been one of three things: “stupidity at the 
grandest level, an attempt at sabotage…[or] the theft of 
copper.”


In the nineties, while working as a freelance 
photographer for UI, Harold Shapiro photographed 
English Station when one of the turbines was being 
dismantled for cleaning. Shapiro is the head of the photo 
department at Creative Arts Workshop on Audubon 
Street, a community art school in New Haven. An 
associate fellow in Jonathan Edwards College, Shapiro 
has worked as a full-time photographer since 1981, and 
started doing freelance work for UI in 1989. Shapiro 
photographed for internal publications and captured 
some images of the interior of the power plant. At the 
time, UI owned English Station, which it built in the late 
1920s.


Ever since he was a child, Shapiro loved lighting and 
electricity. He was naturally attracted to power plants, 
which produced both. 


“While I was taking pictures of that I was able to 
explore the cavernous beauty of the space,” Shapiro 
said. He was fascinated by the “accidental beauty” of 
the pipes and metal structures. “I also play woodwind 
instruments,” Shapiro said, “and the beautiful shape of 
the saxophone and flute…are reminiscent a little bit to 
me in the power plant.”


Shapiro’s photographs, in contrast to Randall’s, are 
mostly sharp and clean. They depict an English Station 
that is an object of industrial strength and power, not of 
decay. The plant was about to go offline. 


In 1992, UI stopped power production at English 
Station and mothballed the plant, shutting it down in a 
manner that would make it easy to restart in the future. 
It is unclear why UI shut down the power plant—local 
activists said that it was because the plant was inefficient, 
and UI declined to comment for this story.


UI transferred English Station in 2000, with about 
$4 million for remediation, to Quinnipiac Energy, LLC 
(QE). QE acquired English Station with the intention of 
opening it as a peaking plant, which meant that it would 
only generate power during times of peak demand like 
the summer months when air conditioning use was 
especially high. 


The New Haven Environmental Justice Network 
(EJN) was formed in response to QE’s application, said 
Mark Mitchell, founder of the EJN. The EJN took issue 
with QE’s plan, since it would provide power to Fairfield 
County, which is in the 94th percentile of median 
household income according to recent census data, at 
the expense of polluting the low-income neighborhood 
of Fair Haven. 


It would have been especially harmful for residents 
living in nearby public housing facilities, such as Farnam 
Courts, which is less than half a mile west of English 


When Joe McAllister got the news that the DEEP 
had issued a cease and desist order for Grant 
Mackay Company’s project at English Station, he 
traveled to Connecticut immediately. McAllister has 
been working for GMC for four years, and took his 
current position as general counsel in the summer of 
2012. He describes himself as “the emergency guy.” 
The cease and desist order “was a complete shock,” 
McAllister said. To this day, he continued, nobody from 
the DEEP has explained why the order was issued.


When I relayed this to Saliby, she responded, “Well, 
that’s a complete shock to me.” She said that she met 
with McAllister and engaged in many phone calls after 
the issuance of the order.


McAllister and Kaufman agree that GMC was hired 
and began its work in the summer of 2011. The original 
contract was for GMC to perform a demolition and 
to abate the asbestos. They would “make it a level, flat 
island, like there hadn’t been a building sitting there,” 
McAllister said.


Kaufman later requested a change to the contract. 
Both hold the change came before the cease and desist 
order was issued by DEEP on February 8, 2012. 
Kaufman sought to modify the contract and add an 
option for Asnat and Evergreen to decide if they wanted 
to change the work plan from a full demolition to an 
interior demolition. An interior demolition would entail 
removing non-structural metal, but would keep the 
building standing. In order for the owners to act on this 
option, they would need to pay GMC an extra $850,000 
in cash. Barring the exercise of this option, GMC would 
proceed with the original plan and demolish the building.


Kaufman said that the application for the 
demolition permit was filed so that the owners would 
have the option to knock down the building if they 
wanted to. He said that, at the time the owners filed the 
application, they had not made up their mind about the 
fate of the building. It would be months before GMC 
finished the asbestos abatement and would be ready to 
commence demolition, if the owners desired it. But they 
were nowhere close to carrying out the action.


“It would be a shame if the cease and desist order 
were issued based upon a mistaken assumption that the 
building was slated for demolition,” Kaufman continued. 
Kaufman said that the decision to demolish either 
the interior or exterior of the building could have 
gone either way, but that it was dependent on the city 
approving the demolition permit. President of the New 
Haven Urban Design League, Anstress Farwell, said 
that since English Station is listed in the local historic 
resource inventory, the submission of the demolition 
permit triggered a ninety-day delay of demolition 
ordinance process. If a demolition permit is filed for any 
building listed in the local historic resource inventory, 
the state register of historic places, or the national
