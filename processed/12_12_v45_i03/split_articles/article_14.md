hunks of metal lie like carcasses on the grimy 
floor, and rust grows like mold on pipes in 
English Station, a non-operational coal and 
oil power plant sitting on a man-made dredge island 
in the middle of the Mill River. On October 2, New 
Haven resident Chris Randall ventured into its depths 
and returned with photographic evidence of a surreal 
landscape.


“It’s kind of like a ghost,” Randall said. While 
exploring the site, he imagined what it would have been 
like for people to work at the plant. It must have been 
noisy—not like the dusty silence he experienced. “I can’t 
go into a place like that and not try to envision what it 
was like when it was at its capacity,” he said.


Few have seen English Station’s interior for the past 
ten months; the property is contaminated with dangerous 
amounts of asbestos and polychlorinated biphenyls 
(PCBs), and no work is being done to remediate the site 
due to a cease and desist order issued by the Connecticut 
Department of Energy and Environmental Protection 
(DEEP).


Randall has lived on Lyon Street, about a mile away 
from the site, since 2000. He is the executive director 
of New Haven Land Trust, and he runs a photography 
blog, “I Love New Haven,” with 2011 New Haven 
mayoral candidate Jeffrey Kerekes. He posted a set of 
photos under the title “English Station Invasion (Part
