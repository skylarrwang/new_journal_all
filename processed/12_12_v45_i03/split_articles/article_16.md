register of historic places, ninety days must pass before 
the demolition permit may be granted.
“The whole purpose is not simply to delay someone 
for ninety days, but to create a period of time when you 
can hopefully and reasonably seek out alternatives to 
demolition,” Farwell said.
The filing of the demolition order set off a chain 
reaction. Over the next three months, Farwell gathered 
her forces, contacting partner organizations like the EJN 
and the New Haven Preservation Trust. They contacted 
city officials and helped coordinate the appointment of 
Robert Smuts ‘01, chief administrative officer in New 
Haven, as the point person for the English Station at the 
city level so that someone could coordinate the response 
across the relevant departments.
The goal? “Get the site cleaned up and preserve the 
building,” Farwell said.
The City of New Haven never approved any 
demolition permits for English Station, said Andrew 
Rizzo, a building official with the City of New Haven. 
It is likely that this chain reaction made it all the 
way up to the DEEP. Saliby said that GMC’s demolition 
application triggered the order, and that DEEP received 
documents submitted by representatives of the property 
to the City of New Haven that described the methods 
of demolition. Saliby didn’t know how these documents 
came to the DEEP, but she did know one thing – they 
specified that the demolition would be an implosion.
“If this site was not cleaned up and you implode 
the building, then all the contaminated debris, just like in 
the films at 9/11 with the dust cloud coming down the 
street…is going to fly all over the neighborhood and the 
river,” Saliby explained.
McAllister argued that GMC had not decided 
on an implosion, calling Saliby’s fear a “red herring.” 
Furthermore, the application for the permit to demolish, 
filed in Rizzo’s office, did not make any mention of 
methods for demolition.
“The cease and desist order is a solution looking for 
a problem,” McAllister said.
A hearing pertaining to the cease and desist order 
was held by DEEP on October 1 at which Attorney 
Alan Kosloff, counsel for the owners, did not contest the 
order.  Because the owners were unable to provide GMC 
with access to the property, the contract is terminated, 
as far as GMC is concerned, said McAllister. However,

GMC is continuing to be involved in the situation only 
to the extent necessary to retrieve its equipment from 
the property. The company continues to pay $20,000 a 
month in rental fees for equipment that is sitting on the 
site. McAllister estimated that the company has lost over 
$3 million since July 2011.
Kaufman said that the owners have filed a lawsuit 
this November against GMC, believing the company to 
be in default of the contract. 
“They have a responsibility,” Kaufman said. “They 
don’t have the right to walk away from this.”
Insall is working on a remediation plan to submit to 
the DEEP. Kaufman said that the goal of the plan that 
Insall is working on is to clean up the PCBs in the soil, 
and also to get permission for the owners to return to 
the site to finish the asbestos abatement.
McAllister made it clear that GMC would not be 
returning to the site, regardless of the owners’ plan.
“Grant Mackay will never do work on that site 
again,” McAllister said. “Or for that owner. Or in the 
state of Connecticut. All three.”
O
n a Monday afternoon last month, I was walking 
with the area with Randall, the photographer. At 
around 2:30 p.m., I turned and saw two men close the 
trunk of a car that was parked at the gate in front of 
English Station. Lines of barbed wire ran above metal 
sheets a few feet taller than myself, and signs on the 
sheets warded off trespassers. In a small public gravel 
lot between the site’s gate and Grand Avenue, two men 
jumped into a Lexus SUV, and the driver started pulling 
into the road.
I ran and tried to flag the car down. The passenger 
opened the window, but when I began to introduce 
myself, rolled the window up as the car sped away.
Randall said that he recognized one of the men. 
When Randall had been inside English Station, Randall 
had seen one of the men scavenging five pounds of 
copper. At the time, he told Randall it was “so he could 
eat.”
With the cease and desist order, there is limited 
security at the site, leading to increased scavenging of 
raw materials. Some of the scavenging is legitimate, 
conducted under the approval of the owners, while 
some of it is not.
Brendan Regan has been the owner of Regan 
Metals, a scrap metal company less than a mile away 
from English Station, for the past thirty years. The 125-
year old company was hired by QE to take scrap out of 
the site between 2003 and 2005. Regan described the 
situation at English Station at the time as “weird” and 
“bizarre.”


Many people claimed that they owned the property, 
Regan said. QE would grant his company permission 
to scrap at the site, and then other people would arrive, 
claim they were the owners, and tell Regan Metals 
that they were not allowed to collect scrap metal. One 
time, some people who claimed they were the owners 
attempted to take some of the generators out of the 
plant. “[They were] going to take the big giant generators 
in there and ship them off to Africa,” Regan said. His 
reaction to the situation: “Ok, let’s just get the hell out 
of here.”
While Regan’s company was working to collect 
scrap metal at the site, they would often see or hear 
evidence of scavengers. Kicked down doors lay flat on 
the floor and windows and locks were broken. Other 
times, they would hear foreign noises while doing their 
work; noises came from other sections of the building 
and gave away the presence of people who were not 
supposed to be there.
“People would break into that building every single 
week,” Regan said. “They’re still breaking in there today.”
On the afternoon I visited, the men I saw might 
have been scavenging, but neither Randall nor I could 
see. A trespasser was arrested in October. While these 
two incidences might not have involved stealing scrap 
theft, those who do scavenge play an important role at 
the English Station. Not only are they trespassing on 
the site, stealing scrap metal and financially damaging 
the owners, but they also may be harming themselves 
through exposure to asbestos and PCBs, and spreading 
PCB contamination in the community.
Saliby said exposure to PCBs is associated 
with reproductive disorders, infertility, small head 
circumference in newborns, neurological problems such 
as ADHD, and cancer, specifically tumors of the thyroid, 
liver, and kidneys. It is unclear how much exposure the 
surrounding neighborhoods experience. The PCBs at 
the English Station won’t go anywhere unless they are 
moved by a disturbance. Trespassing, she explained, 
therefore creates a problem for local residents.
She added, “It is possible for contamination from 
the site to migrate to nearby surface water as well as 
groundwater.”
McAllister told me that asbestos-related dangers to 
those who enter the plant have been compounded by 
the scavenging activity. When people remove metal from 
English Station, they might also rip into the insulation, 
which releases asbestos, he said, freeing it into the air 
where it can be breathed. 
Even before GMC came on the scene, scavengers 
caused asbestos problems. Regan said that, although the 
boiler house, which was filled with asbestos, was locked, 


people would often break into it, and his company 
would have go in to secure the room. “It looked like a 
winter wonderland. It was freaky, man. The stuff was 
just hanging from the ceiling.”
Kosloff said that his clients are working with DEEP 
to develop a site security plan, which is in progress. 
Saliby detailed some of the security measures 
currently in place. They include a locked gate, barbed 
wire, razor wire, large warning sings about PCBs, and a 
surveillance camera. These are not associated with the 
plan that Kosloff mentioned.
In addition to harming themselves and possibly their 
community, scavengers are taking income from whoever 
cleans up this site. Remediation of sites like English 
Station is paid for in part by selling some of the material 
on the site for scrap. Scavengers stealing metal make it 
less financially viable for a contractor to clean up the site, 
since they reduce the amount of metal available to sell 
for scrap and cover the cost of remediation. McAllister 
is also worried that GMC’s tools and equipment, which 
it has not been able to access since the cease and desist 
order was served in February, may be—or have already 
been—vandalized or stolen. The contamination poses 
a danger for many parties involved, but it seems only a 
major act of intervention can completely solve it.
