**A Fence Divides**

P
ale-barked branches dip over the fence between 
Hamden and New Haven like old arms. Separat­
ing Hamden, a working-class suburb, from three 
public housing projects in the neighboring city of New 
Haven, there is a 12-foot tall fence. Five-inch long sil­
very, bolted strips link sections of the fence. Its thick 
metal grating fractures views of neighbors’ homes ten 
paces away. Added-on pieces of fence drop into vacant 
spaces among tree roots, screening even squirrel-sized 
holes. The projects are walled off on three sides. Across 
the street from the fence in Hamden, a racially mixed 
neighborhood where the median income is $71,358, a 
green Jaguar rests in the driveway of a boxy, colonial 
home next to two decorative Christmas deer. In the New 
Haven projects, where average income is $12,989 and al­
most all residents are black, low-slung apartments decay 
between patches of broken pavement.

Hamden Mayor Scott Jackson calls the fence a relic 
from the past, a barrier that allows Hamden residents 
to ignore the aspirations of people in the projects. “It’s 
about preserving a mythology,” Jackson told me. “The 
myth is that the people living on the New Haven side 
will be fundamentally different from people on the 
Hamden side.” 

Jackson, a tall, slender man of 40 and Hamden’s 
first black mayor, can be accommodating, speaking in 
cool, vetted sentences designed to repel searching ques­
tions. But he’s also a performer conscious of his iconic 
status, relishing occasions to enlarge his small office. “It 
is not enough to be right; it is our duty to be righteous,” 
he told a Hamden crowd on January 15, 2010 – Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day. Jackson declared that 1960s-era seg­
regation was not long past. Its villains, he said, practiced 
a “hate based on whispers.” He hoped his sons would 
grow up in a nation renewed, defined by the promise of
