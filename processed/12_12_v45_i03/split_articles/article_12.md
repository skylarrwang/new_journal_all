For Yale kids, home is a 
public place.
Eight-year-old Yaqub Bajwa is, on average, a foot 
shorter than his friends and ten to fourteen years 
younger than them. Their statures give them a 
bit of an advantage over him in volleyball, but he is their 
equal in games of Risk. Sometimes they talk about basic 
chemistry and other times they talk about Madagascar 3. 
As a kid growing up at Yale, Yaqub regularly interacts 
with a world he is too young to fully participate in—or 
understand—but that doesn’t keep him from trying.
At 5:30 one evening, I see 
Yaqub saunter into the Timothy 
Dwight dining hall beside his 
mother Lisa Bajwa, TD resident 
fellow, who holds his two-year-
old sister, Aya, propped on her 
hip. His father, Omer Bajwa, has 
some business to attend to tonight 
as Yale’s Muslim Chaplain, so it 
won’t be a full family dinner. 
Yaqub runs into his friends 
as he meanders through the 
dining hall. When they ask him 
how his day is going, he launches 
into the saga of his extraordinary life: how his sister 
has recently learned how to turn doorknobs and keeps 
coming into his room to steal his stuffed animals, or how 
he hid a plastic spider in his teacher’s book as a practical 
joke. Yaqub knows how to work a room.
I catch a glimpse of Yaqub as he rolls his eyes at his 
sister Aya when he sits down at a table. She is pushing 
her toy stroller around the dining hall, but it won’t quite 
fit between the packed tables and she is starting to fuss. 
I sense his mom panic ever so slightly about a temper 
tantrum brewing. She placates Aya by promising her that 
she can draw with the sacred box of markers when they 
get back to the apartment.
Yaqub and Aya have to behave beyond their 
maturity levels because they spend so much time 
in public. Yaqub in particular has to assume two 
personas—one that’s playful and relaxed inside their 
resident fellow’s apartment and 
one that’s composed and well-
behaved around TD. “When we 
moved in, we sat [Yaqub] down 
and told him he had to have a 
certain respectful tone of voice in 
public,” Bajwa said. “You always 
have to be on when you’re out.”
Bajwa believes that his son 
has grown up a lot even in the few 
months since his family moved 
into TD. Since Yale students 
lavish so much attention on him, 
Bajwa sees what he calls their 
“emotional intelligence” beginning to rub off on him. 
“My kids have become more socially mature and more 
sociable since coming here,” he said. “It’s noticeable. My 
parents have said it. My in-laws have said it.” 
Being a Yale kid comes with perks. Clare 
Hungerford, the eleven-year-old daughter of Morse 
Master Amy Hungerford, and Marty Keil ’12, son of 
former Morse Master Frank Keil, both told me that one 
of the best parts of being a campus kid is the Master’s 
house. When Marty moved into the Master’s house at 
age eleven, he was most excited that it had the Game 
Show Network. When he went to dinner in the Morse 
dining hall at night, he could drink as much soda as he 
wanted.

Calhoun’s interim Master. 
Just like any Yalie, 
Yaqub has learned 
how to organize 
his social life 
around meals.
