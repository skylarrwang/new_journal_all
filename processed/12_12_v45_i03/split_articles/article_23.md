EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The archery range was eerily quiet.  Usually buzzing with activity, today only a few stray arrows lay scattered on the grass.  I should have known better than to come on a Tuesday.


My aim has been off lately.  My usual bullseye precision feels miles away.  Frustration gnaws at me.  I've tried everything: new bows, different arrows, even meditation.  Nothing seems to work.


Perhaps it's more than just my aim. Perhaps it's the pressure.  Perhaps it's something deeper.




**Title: Ode to a Forgotten Toy**
**Author:  Robert Frost**

In the attic's dust, a soldier sleeps,
His painted coat, a faded hue.
Once proud, he stood, his secrets deep,
Now silent, still, and born anew.


His wooden limbs, once strong and bold,
Now brittle, weak, a fallen king.
A tale untold, a story old,
A childhood's joy, his silent spring.
