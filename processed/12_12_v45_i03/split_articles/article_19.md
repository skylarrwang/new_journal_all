an “American dream, unrestrained.”
But that hate seems to linger – perhaps in few places 
more visibly than in the town Jackson now leads. Ham­
den’s fence prohibits access to public roads on three 
sides of the projects. Over 3,500 feet long, it assures that 
the one road into the projects is also the only way out. 
Residents hoping to buy groceries at a Hamden shop­
ping center three miles away have to travel into New Ha­
ven to get around the fence, a 7.7-mile trip that takes two 
buses and up to two hours to complete. In the case of a 
flood or fire, emergency vehicles have to travel around 
the fence to help residents in the projects. For Jackson, 
the fence proclaims a prejudice 
against the poor that middle-class 
neighborhoods across America 
already whisper.

Hamden built the first ver­
sion of the fence in 1966, a four-
foot tall chain link fence intended 
to keep crime out of an aspir­
ing middle-class neighborhood. 
White, 
working-class 
families 
were fleeing the city projects, 
leaving behind densely concen­
trated poverty. Drug activity and 
violence rose, sometimes spilling 
into Hamden. Crime was so bad that residents say the 
New Haven Fire Department refused to enter the West 
Rock projects without a police escort.

By 2005, those dangers had disappeared. The New 
Haven Housing Authority had cleared the Brookside 
and Rockview projects in preparation for remodeling, 
leaving only the elderly and disabled residents of Ribi­
coff in the West Rock area. Crime dropped dramatically 
in the empty communities as new, mixed-income hous­
ing units rose. But that same year, almost four decades 
after it first built a fence, Hamden responded to holes in 
it by erecting a second, parallel fence, adding a sturdier 
barrier around the city projects’ three edges that rises in 
places to 16 feet.

This fence is now the focus of a fight over its re­
moval that may be more complicated than anyone is 
willing to admit, confounding simple race and class di­
vides. The fence turns neighbors into opponents and 
stereotypes into reality, chaining both communities to a 
past they want to escape. For Mayor Jackson and others, 
the question is whether the myth that one town’s success 
requires the other’s demise will endure in 3,500 feet of 
metal.


J
ackson hoped to begin dismantling that impression at 
an August 29 public meeting in Hamden. New Haven 
Mayor John DeStefano, Jr. and representatives from the 
New Haven Housing Authority were on hand to pres­
ent plans for the new projects. Housing Authority rep­
resentatives came prepared to explain that new home-
ownership units and market-rate rental homes would 
diversify the projects and decrease crime. They hoped 
to tell Hamden residents about a pilot program offering 
job training and education to residents of the projects 
who committed to becoming self-sufficient within seven 
years, effectively imposing term limits on subsidized liv­
ing. New Haven officials brought a traffic study showing 
that removing the fence would not add significant clutter 
to any new intersections. Jackson 
hoped his constituents would lis­
ten to the evidence and talk like 
neighbors. 
But 
instead 
of 
civility, 
Jackson was met with rage. Any 
pretense of cordiality or common 
concern disintegrated. Under the 
fluorescent lights of the Keefe 
Community Center gymnasium, 
where three hundred people were 
packed into a space meant for one 
hundred, Hamden residents slung 
insults at New Haven. Stocky men 
lined up two deep along the walls and young couples 
craned their necks in the doorway as residents whispered 
talking points about crime and traffic into each other’s 
ears. An angry, unbridled Jackson emerged.

Jackson was still introducing the proposal to tear 
down the fence when one man called out, “It’s not going 
to happen!” The crowd’s whoops drowned his pleas for 
civility. “We’re here to talk. We’re here to talk. We’re not 
here to yell, alright?” he shouted, eagerly at first, then in 
desperate whines.

Anger and fear trampled conversation. Hamden 
residents described the robberies and traffic overflow 
they said would result from opening the fence. 
“Keep Hamden in Hamden and keep New Haven 
in New Haven!”
“That’s their choice to live by a fence.”
“You put a street through, you’re jeopardizing every 
single person in this entire room’s life.” 
Mayor DeStefano, who is white, told me that 
“nowhere in history” have good fences made good 
neighbors. At the meeting, hoping to mend the 
developing rift between Hamden and New Haven, he 
rose to boos, spoke through insulting chatter, and ended 
by tabling his request for the fence to be torn down in 
favor of a year of dialogue between residents from both 
communities.

December 2012
Near the end of the evening, Jackson was asked 
what he thought of the fence. For three years, since 
his election in 2009, Jackson had defended the fence. 
“Particularly as an iconic mayor in some ways, it was 
very important to me to listen more than I talked,” he 
explained, referring to his status as Hamden’s youngest 
and first black mayor. But now Jackson, ineffectual and 
exposed, let himself speak. “I don’t like the fence, but 
I understand it,” he said to more boos. He meant he 
understood people’s old fears of crime from the projects, 
but denied that walls were the answer. One woman 
stood screaming rejoinders at him from a distance of a 
few feet until police nudged her away.

More than the meeting’s result, I puzzled over the 
mood in the room that night. Residents of Hamden, black 
and white both, hurled invectives against New Haven 
residents charged with a dangerous sort of animosity. 
The fence was more than a bulwark against crime and 
traffic. Something about those people in the projects needed 
to be contained. It wasn’t race; the Hamden crowd was 
at least half black. It wasn’t simple geography or class, 
either; the crowd seemed to fear more than that in its 
neighbors. Something was amiss. “It did not feel like a 
safe meeting,” the Hamden town planner, Leslie Creane, 
told me. The gym was choked with a tension that seemed 
primed to explode.

It nearly did when Mike Hutsell, who lives near 
the fence in Hamden, stood to ask his question. He 
charged Jackson with forgetting constituents’ problems 
with crime. “How many times have you had your house 
broken into?” Hutsell demanded.

Jackson began to answer, but Hutsell interrupted, 
saying he wasn’t finished, and soon Jackson was pointing 
his left index finger at Hutsell and moving towards him, 
his eyes splayed wide and his shoulders hunched in 
tension as if restraining his body. “You ask the question, 
I answer,” Jackson yelled, angry that Hutsell spoke over 
him. Then again, without restraint, “YOU ASK THE 
QUESTION, I ANSWER.” Two people grabbed hold 
of Jackson’s shoulders and pushed him into the hallway. 
The demons Jackson once described on Martin Luther 
King, Jr. Day had come out to play in the town he now 
ran and they chased him from the gym.

A 
few weeks after the meeting, as Jackson sat 
behind his desk on the third floor of Hamden’s 
Government Center, I asked him what made him lose 
his cool.

“I just, I didn’t like the tone,” he said before trailing 
off. “Let me see if I can find something real quick.”

Jackson turned to his computer monitor. I guessed 
he was searching for a nasty constituent email or a 
recording of the meeting. “Sometimes being a student 
of this stuff makes it a lot more challenging than it 
probably needs to be,” he mumbled. 
 “Alright, this is a good one,” he said finally. Jackson 
turned his computer monitor around. On the screen was 
a photo in which two thickly clad firefighters turn their 
hoses on a black woman crouching against a lamppost 
in the 1960s. “In 2012 we can clearly look at that picture 
and say who’s right and who’s wrong. Clearly.” He said 
he felt for the firefighter who rested his head on his 
pillow every night knowing he was the bad guy. “Being 
on the wrong side of history is something that I find to 
be just the worst possible way to look back at the way 
I have done my job. I prefer to be ahead of the curve 
of history.” The fence, a relic from a time when certain 
people couldn’t choose where they ate or made their 
homes, was well behind that curve. Bringing the fence 
down, he said, was the right thing to do—or would one 
day be seen that way. “In fifty years, one hundred years, 
somebody’s going to think this is right.”

Then who were the people from Hamden standing 
against Jackson, the people whose grudge against the 
projects resisted the tide of history and overwhelmed 
politicians? Jackson explained that they are working class 
and many are black. Some grew up in the projects. They 
go to church with people from New Haven. Jackson 
said the piles of media reports he’d seen painting his 
constituents as out-of-touch elitists had gotten it wrong 
in a reach for the obvious story. 
People in Hamden weren’t quite keeping out a 
social class or set of values, it seemed. They were 
shutting out something harder to define, a mentality 
feared and unknown, a lifestyle of limited possibilities 
and government handouts not so distant from their 
working-class suburb. 

I
t took me only a few minutes in the home of Mike 
Hutsell, the same man who clashed with Jackson at 
the meeting, to realize that those fighting to maintain the 
fence aren’t exaggerating their fears. Hutsell lives with 
his wife Marilyn on Woodin Street in Hamden. They’re 
a black, working-class couple, and they keep a baseball 
bat by every door of their home. They said they’ve had 
two cars stolen and their house broken into once, in­
cidents they blame on New Haven criminals who they 
say crossed into Hamden before the second fence was 
raised in 2005. Mike sleeps with a Browning high-pow­
ered 9 millimeter gun under his bed. Marilyn sleeps with 
a Smith and Wesson 357 Magnum. Before he goes to 
sleep Hutsell enables five locking devices on his Dodge 
minivan. “That’s because the government can’t or won’t 
protect us,” he said. “That fence is our security.”

Marilyn led me to a dining room attached to the 
side of her home draped in red and gold cloth. A wreath 
hung on the wall and the table was set permanently for 
eight, plastic leaves scattered among gold plates and 
thick candles. Sheets of wood made up the walls. It 
looked like a life-sized construction project, and I won­
dered why Marilyn had chosen this setting. Suddenly she 
blurted its purpose. “We built this room by hand.” The 
dining room was a monument to the value she most 
wanted to impress on me: the Hutsells were self-made 
folks.

Marilyn said the difference between people in Ham­
den and the people in New Haven’s projects is work 
ethic. When Marilyn had a heart attack at age sixty, she 
ignored doctors’ advice and returned to her job at a law 
firm. Mike has two bad knees and a bad back but drives 
an oil delivery truck during the week and works at a se­
curity firm on weekends. “This is what you achieve by 
pulling your own self up. We’re not for entitlements,” 
Marilyn declared. She said people who claim that there 
are no jobs available, even in the projects, aren’t trying. 
“All you have to do is just look for it.” 

Marilyn said she feels proud driving down Woodin 
Street. “They are the homes of working class people.” 
They don’t have junk in the yard and if they do, it’s about 
to be cleaned.

The Hutsells said they supported the fence be­
cause they wanted to rest without worrying their things 
would be stolen. But their anxieties weren’t all so basic. 
“I don’t want to see the thugs, as my husband said, with 
the pants hanging down and the stuff that comes out 
of their mouths,” Marilyn explained. When I asked her

Some Hamden residents worry that tearing down the fence will lead to crime by increasing contact with residents of  the Brookside projects.
