dancing, good friendships, and good exercise.“ He is a 
self-proclaimed player and performer, a seeming vector 
of love and energy. He gushes over an encounter he had 
at this year’s Gathering of  the Vibes. “Someone came up to 
me said, ‘I think of you every day. Seeing you be free to 
do what you love makes me be more free.’ And then she 
disappeared off into the crowd.” 

My phone buzzes one evening in early December 
to a text message from Triffin. Earlier that 
day, I’d called Eric to ask what his earliest childhood 
memory was, struggling to picture him at a time before 
he developed his energy and acute eye for the world. 
His response had been hesitant — uncharacteristically 
uncomfortable, even — but he’d told me that I’d caught 
him on his way back in from a hike. He set in on a 
beautiful description of young summers spent on a bean 
and peach farm in Tuscany. 
In the text message, Triffin reveals to me his actual 
earliest memory; that of being in utero, in the “womb 
room.” Amid severe complications with her pregnancy, 
Triffin’s mother had been advised to abort by the chief 
obstetrician at the American Hospital in Paris. Instead, 
she heeded the word of a midwife, staying bedridden 
through the final months of her pregnancy.
“Throughout my youth, I would feel this sense of, 
like, three atmospheres weighing on me. It would come 
over me a couple of times a year, only when I was very 
relaxed, and stopped entirely when I was about twenty-
eight. I could feel myself being breathed by an entity 
greater than myself, very protected and totally connected 
to everything around me.” 
“I think it gave me a leg up in peacefulness, 
connectedness, and comfort with my environment,” he 
continues. “Perhaps my first dancing was in utero.”
It’s by far the strangest thing that Triffin has 
ever shared with me, and yet, I find it compellingly 
honest. Triffin’s self-conscious revelation is impossibly 
grounded, even in its visceral otherworldliness. 
It reminds me of a comment he had shared with me 
just that morning: “Someone once told me that I danced 
in order to pretend that gravity affects me.”
Whether he’s dancing with his feet or with his words, 
Triffin has a unique way of making sense of most 
things, revealing wisdom and truth to his audience just 
as Shakespeare’s fool does. But perhaps Triffin’s clearest 
moment is when he explains his own vibrant identity. 
“Viruses are embedded in the DNA, the very fabric, 
of all life,” he spells out with a smile. “They’re the 
motivators that push us to look outside ourselves and to 
share, to learn, to explore beyond convention. Aren’t we 
all simply looking to find a host and connect?”
There’s a lot that can get lost in the unorthodox 
image of Triffin, but eventually, the beauty of his 
genuine substance sneaks up on you and forces you 
to think. My mind often flickers back to the festivities-
infected New Haven Green, where I first met Triffin. 
As I laughed and speculated where he missed the turn 
to Woodstock, he asked me, “What are you doing when 
you feel most alive?” 
I should have sensed the contagion then.
