and Hungarian tend to receive the most funding. 

However, the logistics of tracking down native 
speakers of the language to serve as language partners 
can prove difficult. The partners are crucial since, 
as Ravi Pokhrel GRD ’13, a DILS language partner 
in Nepali, explained, DILS is less a class and more a 
series of conversations. Wells discontinued her study of 
Choctaw this fall because her language partner retired, 
and DILS could not find a replacement for her. Scott 
similarly had difficulty finding a Twi speaker to mentor 
his independent learning. The challenges of executing 
DILS limit who completes it successfully.

The small size of the program contributes to its 
low profile on campus. Applications for the spring 
semester are also due several months before the end of 
the fall semester, meaning a lot of students do not know 
about the program until after the deadline, Brown said. 
Students can only take DILS for four semesters while 
at Yale, an unfortunate limit for those trying to keep up 
with a language for a post-graduation goal. 

If there is enough interest, languages offered 
through DILS can transition to Yale’s standard course 
offerings, though there are many other factors involved 
in that decision. In part due to a high demand for Dutch, 
the administration set up a program in the summer of 
2011 and offered two levels of the language this fall. 
Through DILS, students reflect a body of smaller, 
diverse interests and help Yale stay relevant.

And, as Brown knows, relevance is power. He hopes 
to make being a doctor on a reservation more relevant. 
In the Navajo language, cocaine is represented by collage 
of words, a description of white crystals that you snort. 
“A lot of elderly people see their grandchildren and stuff 
using cocaine.  They might not know, if their doctor 
says “did they have crack” or something; but if their 
doctor says [the same thing] in a traditional method of 
explaining it, then it works out better.” Communication 
is key.
