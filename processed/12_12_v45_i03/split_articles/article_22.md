**Title: Missed Connections Poetry: New Haven Edition**
**Author: Cindy Ok**
**Page number(s): 38-39**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The Have Cave has always been a city of connection, since even before its Puritan times. People pair up here 
constantly—for the night, for a year, and, not infrequently, for their lives. It can happen in a freshman entryway or at 
Toad’s, and in Claire’s Corner Copia or on the Green. But these can also be, and often are, momentary couplings. The 
following poems are entries on the “missed connections” section of the New Haven Craigslist page from November, 
with added line breaks and titled by listing headings. 

Guy with dad at Yale Hospital
I saw you in the waiting room with your dad, 
I believe he had an oxygen tank. He said, 
“I’m a regular here” to a woman talking to 
the both of you in a wheelchair. We made 
eye contact a few times, you had brown hair that 
went around your eyebrows. 
oh. wow.
well then 
let’s not talk of love 
or chains 
or things we can’t untie 

better yet, 
let›s not forget 
how much cooler it would have been 
had i met you at 28 
and not 18. 
or if there were only 
a 12-year age difference and 
not a twenty-plus difference. 


Waiter at Miya’s Sushi
To the cute waiter 
at Miya’s sushi 
I hope you see this!
(We made a lot of 
eye contact but 
I was with my friend and 
I didn’t want to be rude.)


Missed you at the meeting
Saw you at the technology meeting yesterday. 
Sitting along the wall, you had a blue shirt and 
dark pants while I had short hair and was dressed in 
a tan shirt and sipped a small coffee, seated with 
the group on the large table. I could hardly 
keep myself from looking at you the whole time 
which was likely obvious to you. We walked 
out the door together but I missed the chance to 
speak to you even as we walked down the hall 
next to each other. I followed you down the stairs 
and as you exited the building we separated. 
We appear to be partners in related organizations 
and I would really like to find out who you are. 
I can’t seem to stop thinking about you. 


food vendor
10AM most weekdays. I walk by. 
Most of the warm days you were outside and 
we said hello. Occasionally a brief conversation. 
Sometimes I thought that perhaps you were 
waiting for me. 

But now it is cold and you are 
working inside. Makes sense to me. I see you but 
I don’t get to say hello. If you would like 
we could meet somewhere after work. 
A drink or some coffee. We could say hello. 

One time you mentioned your weekend job. 
Let me know what that is so I know it is you.
