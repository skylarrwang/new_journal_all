O
n a Saturday evening in late June, a man 
dressed in flourescent tie-dye presses his 
thumbs together and curls over his fingers to 
form a flying heart. The Carolina Chocolate Drops is 
playing “Cornbread and Butterbeans” to subburned 
picknickers who skip and swing feverishly on the New 
Haven Green. Eric Triffin, with his tightly sprung coils, 
a receded hairline, and a full white beard, dances alone to 
the left of the stage. He wears a tie-dye T-shirt featuring 
a giant pink heart that cushions the rainbow peace sign 
strung around his neck. His dance moves are varied 
and interpretive, sometimes vaguely yogi-esque—he 
balances unsteadily on one leg and swims through the 
air; he runs frantically in place with limbs flying in all 
directions and he whirls around in a dizzy trance — but 
what he called his “visual applause” never falls short of 
euphoric. Eyes closed, smile bursting, he is a display so 
uninhibitedly outlandish — seemingly delirious, even — 
that I wonder if the high of summertime music can fully 
account for it.

To New Haven locals, Triffin, also known as 
“Trippin’ Triffin,” “Eric the TranscendDancer,” or 
simply “Carrotman,” West Haven Public Health 
employee for nearly twenty-four years, is a celebrated 
local fixture. His infectious presence and psychedelic 
performances have been visible at local festivals and live-
band performances for decades — including, as Triffin 
claims, over five hundred Mondays of Rohn Lawrence’s 
“Smooth Jazz” at Lilly’s Pad. He’s been known to make 
appearances in everything from a giant carrot costume 
to — as Toad’s bartender Aspen Powers confirms — 
full-body electroluminescent wiring that can strobe in 
beat with the music.

There’s no doubt that Triffin’s seemingly unhinged 
image can initially be perplexing. “From a distance,” 
Richard Borer, West Haven’s former mayor, tells me, 
“it’s easy to think he’s some burned-out hippie walking 
down Chapel Street.” Indeed, “hippie” is a title that 
Triffin himself fully embraces. In a voice full of whimsy, 
he tells me that his heart has felt the affirmation of the 
love generation at Woodstock. 

Perhaps nothing is more perplexing than attempting 
to reconcile this image with Triffin’s professional career. 
While Triffin claims that dancing is what he’s doing 
when he feels most alive, he knows what it means to 
“bring home the tofu.” He worked at West Haven
