have to go searching for its troubling undercurrents. 

“I felt like I was raped,” Miriam blurted, unprompted, 
referring to the break-ins. “I felt absolutely violated.” 
Her words were charged with a disgust that signaled 
something uglier than the considerable distress a rob­
bery might provoke. Robbery became rape, a personal 
violation, perpetrated not just by any criminal but by an 
Other whom she hated.
“It’s a pig pen,” Miriam said later of Ribicoff, un­
prompted again, seeming repulsed. “It’s dirty.” But Ribi­
coff wasn’t a pig pen until it was fenced in. And it didn’t 
become “dirty,” a stain on the clean suburbs, until neigh­
bors like Miriam called it a pig pen. The fence helped 
people in Hamden weaponize their words, turning the 
projects into a pen and making the projects’ residents 
dirty. 

Darnell Goldson, former alderman for New Haven’s 
West Rock neighborhood, 
is one of the few public officials 
who has never equivocated on the 
fence. “In the civil rights era you 
didn’t allow folks to figure out on 
their own how not to be racist,” 
he said, explaining that he hopes 
someone challenges the fence in 
court. “You forced the issue.”
Sitting at a Popeye’s chicken 
restaurant, Goldson said the fence 
is a reminder that racism still fouls 
American cities. After Hurricane 
Katrina, a group trying to evacu­
ate New Orleans was stopped on 
a bridge by police officers from 
neighboring Gretna, Louisiana. Officers fired warning 
shots at the group and told them they wanted “no Su­
perdomes” in Gretna, “code,” one evacuee wrote in a 
later account, “for if you are poor and black, you are not 
crossing the Mississippi River.” The Gretna police chief 
told the San Francisco Chronicle that his officers had been 
ordered to seal off the suburban city.
Goldson explained: “If you can put a fence to stop 
people from looking for a job, go shopping, go visit their 
aunt who lives in Hamden, what’s to stop you from put­
ting up a fence across a bridge when there’s a disaster 
in the town next door and there are folks that you don’t 
want to see in your town?”
In a 2005, a group of black public housing residents 
from Baltimore sued the U.S. Department of Housing 
and Urban Development, alleging racial segregation and 
discrimination in the city’s public housing system. One 
of the offenses they charged was the construction of a 
fence separating the public housing development from 
a predominantly white community nearby. The judge 
ruled that the government did not violate the Equal Pro­
tection rights of the black residents because the fence 
was motivated by concerns about crime rather than race.

Goldson’s counterpart in Hamden, its strident citi­
zens’ most loyal supporter of the fence in city 
council, is Mike Colaiacovo. Colaiacovo passed out nine 
hundred and fifty flyers telling residents about Hamden’s 
August 29 meeting. Residents skeptical of all levels of 
government reserved only thanks for Colaiacovo. He 
was a responsible man serving a responsible citizenry.
Colaiacovo ignored my twice-daily calls to his home 
and cell phone for two weeks. I left messages telling him 
his constituents trusted him. Would he please answer a 
few questions?
Finally, I drove to Colaiacovo’s home and knocked 
on his door. It was 5 p.m. on a 
Friday. The blinds were drawn 
and the house looked dark. His 
nephew, Mark, twenty-one, an­
swered the door, eyes droopy and 
shoulders slouched. Was this Mike 
Colaiacovo’s home? Mark pointed 
behind him towards the kitchen, 
where a short man in gray, cot­
ton shorts and a baggy sweatshirt 
stuck his face out from around 
a corner. Colaiacovo shook his 
head and slipped back behind the 
corner. Mark told his uncle again 
who I was. Colaiacovo’s face re­
emerged, glassy eyes on a small, 
weathered face beneath a mop of black curls. He disap­
peared again into the kitchen.
I had the sense that something was wrong, but Co­
laiacovo slowly dragged his body forward. “Come in.” I 
asked him about his defense of the fence. “We’re used to 
Brookside neighborhood and gunshots and, you know, 
stuff like that, you know, and so they’re very, uh, how 
could I say it, scared, scared, scared of what’s gonna 
happen there, you know?” What about the August 29 
meeting? “Crazy,” he chuckled. Mayor Jackson’s out­
burst? “Disappointed.”
Colaiacovo’s eyes were bloodshot and he fidgeted 
his fingers nervously in his lap. He asked me whether I 
wanted a drink. His voice slipped between registers and 
his eyelids drooped. Mark, more alert than his uncle, fin­
ished his sentences and reordered his words. “Do you 
have concerns about how the fence affects people in the 
projects?” I asked. Colaiacovo shrugged, his eyes search­
ing for focus while his eyelids shuttered again. “It is what 
it is,” he slurred. He was drunk, and I left.
Colaiacovo told me later that he had been celebrat­
ing his nephew’s 21st birthday. But even if he had suc­
cumbed to nothing worse than a few moments of self-
indulgence, the visit was troubling. While his constitu­
ents blamed New Haven’s poor for failures of discipline 
they said justified the projects’ enclosure, Colaiacovo, 
buttressed by a status quo that gave him an advantage, 
enjoyed a consequence-free afternoon of excess.

When I met New Haven’s Mayor DeStefano in his 
downtown City Hall office, one of the first things 
he expressed was his pride that New Haven welcomed 
six hundred Hamden students into its schools every day 
as part of an inter-district program. But he said none 
attend Catherine Brennan School in West Rock even 
though it posted the largest testing gains in the district 
last year and is close to Hamden students’ homes.
“You know why?” DeStefano asked. “It’s got a rep.” 
He pointed to a nine-foot-tall map on his wall showing 
the West Rock projects sticking out of New Haven like 
a lonely peninsula. He said the school was a proud place, 
“but because we allow it to be separated and isolated—
particularly from Hamden which surrounds it on three 
sides!—it’s got a rep. It’s not based on a fact, it’s based 
on an ignorance.”
The fence kept Hamden from getting to know the 
school; its physical isolation reinforced its bad reputa­
tion. The school’s reputation, in turn, reinforced its 
isolation, keeping Hamden students away even as the 
school made gains. As long as the fence remained, 
homes would be harder to fill and crime more likely to 
rise. Suddenly the projects’ reputation becomes reality 
and Hamden has a reason to stay away.
DeStefano said Hamden residents don’t know 
about life on the other side of the fence because they 
don’t want to know. “They’re getting to keep their fears 
because they are refusing to hear anything else. It’s how 
we could kill each other in the name of a loving God. 
All over the world.”
 “Look at Israel right now,” DeStefano continued. 
Israel and Gaza, kept separate by a blockade, had just 
completed seven days of fighting in which six Israelis 
and 158 Palestinians were killed. “People and missiles 
can go over fences,” he said. “Ultimately you’ve got 
to solve the problem of making sure you have healthy 
communities.” DeStefano saw fences not as a response 
to crime, but fundamentally as a response to unhealthy 
communities. Crime doesn’t emerge out of thin air; it 
grows out of deeper problems like unemployment, poor 
infrastructure, and too few jobs and resources. DeSte­
fano said fences only intensify animosities. “If you leave 
that fence up with this new community going in there, 
you’re sending a direct message about how I feel about 
you.”
DeStefano cited recent efforts by the New Haven 
Housing Authority to redevelop housing projects like 
Quinnipiac Terrace and Monterrey Place as evidence 
that mixed-income developments reduced crime and im­
proved community life. Hamden’s Police Chief, Thomas 
Wydra, agreed, calling the fence “failed public policy,” a 
symbol “none of us should be proud of.” He told me 
the fence makes crime reduction more difficult. Dead 
ends attract criminals who like operating out of sight. 
Police response times improve without the fence.
DeStefano said the fence reminded him of Jim 
Crow laws, but didn’t think people would soon see it 
with the same starkness. “I don’t think anyone’s going to 
be embarrassed by it,” he said. The fence, he seemed to 
recognize, was based in complicated class prejudices that 
were harder to interpret than their racial antecedents.
“Why do people hold onto their fears and ignoranc­
es?” DeStefano asked. He said economically insecure 
Hamden residents wanted to feel superior to lower-class 
residents of the projects. But, he continued, everyone 
has the same self-interest in healthy communities. Ide­
ally, the projects would improve, the fence would fall, 
and Hamden would benefit from new commerce. But 
neither community will get there without exposing itself 
to injury. Hamden has to trust New Haven to build a 
better project. New Haven has to trust Hamden to open 
its borders in good faith. Both communities will have to 
let old wounds heal in full public view.
 “It means we’re going to have to take chances on 
one another. How is that different from falling into a 
relationship with another person? You take a risk.”
From the Ribicoff projects in New Haven, Mark 
Grant, thirty-four, understands why people won’t take 
risks. He stood on a grassy hill picking leaves out of 
his two-year-old son Israel’s cornrows. Thick clumps of 
hair stuck out from his head and scars rested above both 
eyebrows. 
“This is checkers,” Grant told me. “Everybody 
got a bunch of kings on the board jumping all over the 
place. You don’t want your king to get lost, so you go 
jump him way over here so I can’t take him no more. I’m 
gonna move mine because I’m not gonna let you take 
mine. So we’re sitting here with a bunch of kings moving 
around trying not to get jumped.”
Nobody was willing to expose himself. Each 
hoarded his wealth. Mike Hutsell couldn’t let down his 
guard until New Haven built a better project. New Ha­
ven couldn’t build a better project until Mike Hutsell let 
down his guard. 
Grant continued: “It’s detrimental because now I 
feel like this” – he pointed towards Hamden – “is more 
sacred than this. You get the children underdeveloped 
over here because of how strongly these people feel 
about them. Now they feel alienated, segregated, be­
littled.”
Grant wiped away the last shreds of leaf from Is­
rael’s cornrows. “Keep everything off your head. Don’t 
put anything on your head, man,” he pleaded kindly.
“You’re talking about generational wealth and gen­
erational curses,” Grant said. “This right here represents 
a generational curse.”
I asked him what sort of curse the fence represents.
“You can be president one day,” Grant taunted sar­
castically. “The kids can’t appreciate that. That’s what it 
represents because now you talk about your parents and 
grandparents saying to our parents and grandparents, 
‘Your children can’t come amongst our children. You 
can’t ride up the street and see our holiday decorations 
when the snow falls.’”
I asked Grant about his neighbors, women who, like 
a number of other residents of the projects, told me 
they wanted to let the fence be. “If we care about our 
mothers, give them what they need. They need it down. 
So we broaden them.” The fence, he suggested, needs to 
come down because some people in Ribicoff aren’t sure 
whether it should come down or not. That’s the project 
life that Candace Jones lamented, a life so thoroughly 
integrated into the oppressive ideology of its power bro­
kers that people don’t care whether they can walk on the 
same streets as the privileged, catch the same buses to 
the same shopping malls and the same schools.
The simplest recipe for prosperity, Grant said, was 
to open the border. People would move freely, crime 
would fall, and Hamden would become a more desirable 
location. 
Yet some mixture of hate and fear – not quite 
of race or class but of a lifestyle terrifying in its quiet 
subjugation to the nasty, inertial laws of a life of pov­
erty – maintained the divide. In Hamden, the hate was 
coded in concerns over traffic and shootings. Elsewhere 
in America, it might take the form of a zoning regula­
tion mandating a Spanish tile roof that adds $30,000 to 
construction costs. Or a minimum one acre zoning or­
dinance. Everywhere were erected invisible walls to hold 
poverty at a distance. 
What, in the fall of 2012, kept this tiny, fractured 
community from mending its wounds? Racial integra­
tion had won in Hamden; a black mayor was elected. 
Smart housing policy had won in New Haven; the proj­
ects were being rebuilt. But the fence remained. Its mon­
strous metal sliced open two communities to expose 
prejudices not less nasty than 1960s-era racism thriving 
on the weak minds of angry men, preying on the holy 
heads of innocent boys.

In some ways, Hamden and New Haven are 
locked in a battle more complex than previous genera­
tions knew. Hate has entangled itself in the homes of 
the black Hutsells and the white Masseys without regard 
for color or class. Old hatreds have been encoded in a 
language of crime and government handouts, language 
becoming more inscrutable the more it’s used. Mayor 
Jackson and Mayor DeStefano fight villains that are dif­
ficult to name. Walls multiply and hope loses to fear.

I 
asked Mayor Jackson to visit the fence with me on a 
cold Thursday morning. He’d been tiring of talking 
about the fence, and I hoped visiting it would reawaken 
his resolve. I was wrong. “I’ve already used up my an­
nual allotment of emotion on the fence,” he said when 
we arrived. The only memory he could stir was of the 
one time he’d seen someone crawl out of the projects 
through the fence. It wasn’t a thief or drug dealer. It had 
been a black woman in a business suit, made up as if 
heading to work, leaving through a hole in the pre-2005 
fence.
As Jackson and I spoke, a woman who lived on 
Thorpe Drive, across from the fence in Hamden, 
stopped her Jeep as she drove by and leaned out an open 
window. “Mayor Jackson, when we had that meeting 
about the fence and it was a big uproar, I want to say 
that I really did respect your honesty.” Jackson, bundled 
in two jackets, was taken aback. Jackson knew the wom­
an supported the fence, and had appeared ready for a 
confrontation. Instead, the woman explained that she 
had four kids and she had put herself through nursing 
school, but could still identify with people in the proj­
ects. “If I lost a month’s worth of pay check,” she said, 
gesturing towards New Haven, “I could easily be on that 
side of the fence.”
Jackson thanked the woman as she drove away, 
shining a bit from the praise. “For a moment – for a 
moment – she had faith in somebody,” he told me. “At 
some point, I will capitalize on that. We will capitalize on 
that.” In that moment, the thin line between the impulse 
to reach out and the impulse to lash out –between scared 
people trusting someone and scared people hurting 
someone – appeared to shift towards trust. Two com­
munities seemed to rest in the balance as one woman 
reached over the fence.
