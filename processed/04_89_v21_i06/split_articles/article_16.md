going to send their best science
students to Yale."

There are a number of reasons why
Yale's science departments may appear
less attractive than those of other
univers1ttes.
Unlike Harvard and
M.I.T, which receive funding from
corporations such as Xerox, and
Stanford, which can draw on the
resources of nearby Silicon Valley,
Yale lacks substantial local support
from
technological industries.
These other universities tout their
research facilities
when wooing
potential
science
under-
graduates. At Stanford, promotional
brochures feature the mile-long Linear
Accelerator. Yale has no such flashy
equipment. "Having a
showcase
facility is just that," said Professor of
Biology
Robert Wyman.
"One
shouldn't . confuse
it for better
teaching."

Science professors at Yale
emphasize the university's strengths as
"People are surprised
to hear rm a science
major because I don't
wear coke-bottle
glasses or walk around
with a calculator in
my pocket."
a teaching rather than a research
institution. They say that the science
departments don't deserve a
bad
image. Yet science students, upon
arriving at Yale, find the university
less than welcoming. A good fifteen
minute walk separates Science Hill
from the other classrooms, dormi-
tories, and administrative buildings.
In addition, science majors are socially
isolated, saddled with stereotypes by
their peers. "A lot of people are
surprised to hear rm a science major
because I don't wear coke-bottle glasses
or walk around with a calculator in my
pocket," said Joseph Cerro (BK '89), a
molecular biophysics and biochemistry
major.

The campaign
to
increase
the
population of science students at Yale
will help create a friendlier environ-
ment. With greater representation,
science majors can feel that they
belong to a significant community. "I
think it's important to have sufficient
numbers of science students so they
feel supported; that they're not the
outcasts or the weirdos, and in order to
do that they have to be more than
token," said Professor of Biology Alvin
Novick.
