The Machine Shifts Gears 
"Stunned" was 
the word most 
frequently used by 
New Haven 
political observers to describe their 
reaction to city Mayor Biagio "Ben" 
DiLieto's announcement that he will 
not run for a sixth two-year term this 
year. He faced a contest for the 
Democratic Party mayoral nomination 
from popular black state senator John 
Daniels, but DiLieto had a good 
chance of surviving that challenge and 
once again steamrolling over the 
candidates of the Republican and 
Green parties 
in the 
November 
election. The departure of DiLieto 
from the city's political stage makes

room tor new actors to compete for the 
starringÂ· role_ but Ieavell the audience 
wondering if the script will really 
change. It remains to be seen if the 
contest to succeed DiLieto will really 
produce a genuine debate about the 
future direction of the city. 

DiLieto's legacy is a city in crisis. 
Despite the fashionable shops and 
restaurants downtown, the demise of 
the city's manufacturing base, 
especially the apparel and fire-arms 
industry, has made New Haven the 
seventh poorest city per-capita in the 
nation. Studies have revealed that the 
hunger and infant mortality in certain 
city neighborhoods is worse than in 
most of the Third World. The "gentri-
fication" of other neighborhoods has 
placed a great strain on New Haven's 
housing resources and created a 
serious problem of homelessness. New 
Haven faces an environmental crisis of 
mammoth proportions unless it finds 
new ways to dispose of solid waste. In 
response to these and other problems, 
the city has experienced a flight of its 
predominantly white middle class to 
the suburbs, further undercutting New 
Haven's tax base and its ability to 
supply adequate social services to its 
remaining population, which 
IS 

increasingly black and Puerto Rican. 

Many of New Haven's problems 
predate DiLieto's tenure as mayor, but 
his critics believe he failed to act 
creatively to solve them. Much of the 
debate centers on the 
issue of 
"underdevelopment." The steady 
decline in federal funding for programs 
to revive decaying urban centers such 
as New Haven during the presidency 
of Ronald Reagan 
forced city 
governments to turn to the private 
sector to finance redevelopment. Few 
city administrations, however, turned 
so avidly to the private sector as 
DiLieto's. By loans, tax concessions, 
and other assistance, 
the city 
underwrote numerous development 
schemes mainly in the city's downtown 
and harbor areas. In its rush to finance 
these programs, the city backed a 
number of fiascos, including the ill-
fated "Downtown South" convention 
center project and inumerable 
downtown shopping mall proposals. 

Critics have charged favoritism in the 
awarding of city support to "preferred 
developers", most of whom were large 
financial 
backers of the mayor's 
campaigns. 

The underlying hope of DrLieto's 
development 
program 
was that 
prosperity would eventually trickle 
down to the poorer neighborhoods 
from the seemingly prosperous 
downtown. After a 
decade, these 
neighborhoods are still waltlng. 

Opponents charge that the mayor has 
played politics with the city's poverty-
related problems. DiLieto created task 
forces to examine such issues as solid 
waste disposal, drugs, hunger, and 
AIDS, but generally packed them with 
his political friends. These committees 
invariably reported back with strong 
endorsements of the mayor's 
programs. 

It is remarkable how little impact the 
unsolved problems of the city have had 
on the mayor's popularity at the polls. 
A few years ago, one New Haven 
magazine compared DiLieto's ability 
to avoid public blame for his admini-
stration's failings with that of former 
President Ronald Reagan. The story 
dubbed him the "teflon mayor." 

DiLieto won reelection in 1981 , 
1983, 1985, and 1987 with majorities 
approaching 75 percent. Meanwhile, 
the Republican Party in New Haven 
dwindled 
to 
a 
corporal's guard, 
controlling only the two wealthiest of 
the city's 30 wards. Most of the "protest 
vote" against DiLieto's policies went to 
the city's third party, the Greens, 
founded in 1985. Still, they have failed 
to attract much more than ten percent 
of the citywide vote. 

DiLieto faced no serious rivals for 
control of the Democratic organization 
after he ousted incumbent mayor 
Frank Logue in a primary in Septem-
ber 1979. 

After his victory, 
the 
Democratic "machine" tolerated little 
dissent. With a stranglehold on city 
hall, it rewarded its friends with 
patronage, city contracts, and various 
forms of special treatment. To receive 
the Democratic nomination for any 
local office required endorsing 
DiLieto's reelection. 

Over the DiLieto decade, 
Democratic-dominated city legislative 
branch, 
Board of Aldermen, 
deteriorated into a rubber stamp for 
the mayor. The only important intra-
party challenge DiLieto faced came in 
1987, when Bill Jones, a popular black 
city personnel administrator, forced 
him into a primary. Jones' lack of 
adequate finances and the machine's 
ability to divide the city's black 
community resulted in DiLieto 
winning by more than a two-to-one 
margin. In the same primary, the 
Democratic machine successfully 
targeted for defeat the handful of 
Democratic aldermen who had 
occasionally opposed the mayor's 
policies. 

The 1987 election victory was the 
highpoint of DiLieto's political career. 
Since then, a series of reversals have 
weakened the mayor politically and 
probably hastened his decision to 
retire. The death of Democratic Party 
Town Chairperson Vincent Mauro in 
late 1987 cost DiLieto his most skillful 
fundraiser and political fence-mender. 
Mauro's loss was keenly felt last year 
during an ugly intra-party battle to 
succeed retiring city Registrar of 
Voters Frank Rossi. When the Demo-
cratic Party Town Committee passed 
over veteran Deputy Registrar Althea 
Tyson, a black woman, to endorse 
Clerk-typist Sharon Ferrucci as Rossi's 
replacement, Tyson's backers charged 
that its motivation was racial. Tyson 
waged a primary challenge against 
Ferrucci and attracted a surprising 
degree of support among white liberal 
activists. Although DiLieto claimed to 
be neutral in this contest, the support 
that Democratic party regulars gave 
Ferrucci, who narrowly defeated 
Tyson, convinced many blacks that the 
machine feared their gaining more 
political power. 

DiLieto then became mired m a 
bruising feud 
with City School 
Superintendent John Dow and the 
chairperson of the New Haven Board 
of Education, the Reverend Edwin R. 
Edmonds. Ostensibly a fight about 
fiscal control over the school budget, 
the contest developed racial overtones 
as Dow and Edmonds, both black, 
argued that the predominantly white 
city administration was underfunding 
the educational needs of New Haven's
