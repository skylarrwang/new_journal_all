Library Renewal 
The new ORBIS computer system has 
gradually affected the lives of Yale 
library users. But for librarians in the 
back rooms of Sterling Memorial 
Library, it has precipitated several 
immediate changes. 

According to 
Gerry Lowell, Associate University 
Librarian for Technical Services, 
ORBIS has stimulated an administra-
tive reorganization that will result in a 
more efficient acquisition and cata-
loguing process. 

The old arrangement resembles an 
assembly line. As one group of workers 
purchases books from dealers and 
publishers, another group catalogues 
new acquisitions, a job that involves 
determining the books' appropriate 
subject headings and assigning them• . 
their proper call numbers. A final 
group prepares the 
volumes for 
shelving. This whole process entails a 
constaerable amount of typing and 
paperwork that ORBIS will eliminate. 

Within the new system, which 
Sterling is the first large research 
library to adopt, each librarian will 
participate in all aspects of book 
processing. Small clusters of workers, 
organized by subjects such as "social 
sciences" or "English and Northern 
European languages," will handle 
every stage of the process within their 
particular fields. 

Lowell s!lid 
the 
Technical 
Services department 
is 
reorganizing in response to increased 
automation; 
as computers become 
widespread, jobs threaten to grow 
increasingly menial. By emphasizing 
creativity and self-management within 
these new subject teams, Lowell hopes 
to produce a better trained and happier 
workforce. 

According to Robert Killheffer, who 
will lead the eleven-person history 
team. many librarians are moving to 
new jobs. "It's an absolute, total 
change," he said. "We're having large-
scale training eflorts. People in the 
teams are going to leam a whole lot of 
things that they never knew before.• 

Killheffer said the library reorganiza· 
tion will resemble the recent changes at 
Volvo automobile plants, 
where 
workers now participate in all stages of 
car manufacturing. "That's a lot more 
interesting than putting bolt A into nut

C," he said. 

In addition to acqumng new tech-
nical skills, library personnel will also 
have to learn how to work with one 
another in the new arrangement. 
"People will have more control over the 
work they do," Killheffer said. "Of 
course, there will have to be adminis-
trative decisions, but those will only be 
a small percentage. Everything else 
will be done collectively." Technical 
Services has brought in consultants to 
lead workshops on group dynamics 
and decision-making. 

Library users will also benefit from 
this administrative overhaul. With 
paperwork and bureaucracy reduced 
to a minimum, the library will be able 
to expand the ORBIS ftles more 
quickly. In addition, because ORBIS 
is connected to all of the library's 
technical service departments and 
research divisions, its users will be able 
to tell what volumes have been 
ordered, what has arrived, and what is 
circulating. 

Lowell admits that Yale was slow to 
adopt ORBIS. "We were one of the last 
kids on the block to go to the 
automated system," he said. But now 
other research libraries are eyeing 
Sterling's pioneering reorganization. 
This 
fall, 
more than 
Yale 
community will be monitoring the 
library's experiment.
