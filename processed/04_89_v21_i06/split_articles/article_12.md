families previously evicted for 
nonpayment of rent. He says suc;, 
prospective tenants are generally 
automatic rejections, but with RAP 
Schmidt could accept them. Because 
the state guarantees rental payments, 
he has consistently reserved 
apartments for RAP recipients coming 
from welfare motels . Schmidt 
describes the majority of these families 
as "model" tenants. 

Today, Schmidt awaits authori· 
zation to open his most recently •
renovated building. A year ago, the 
building's electric~ system was frayed, 
the plumbing was clogged, and the 
staircase was falling down. Vagrants

lived in the halls alongside drog 
dealers. Only two tenants remained in 
a building which could house twelve 
families. 

Schmidt made 
these 
apartments livable and intended to 
open the units to RAP recipients. 
The termination of RAP does not 
significantly affect Schmidt's 
plan~ · 
Although he can no longer open b1S 
building to RAP recipients, he will be 
able to find other tenants. In fact, be 
claims that advertising a renovated 
apartment in New Haven will generate 
hundreds of phone calls. 

Losing RAP has reduced the options 
available for homeless mothers like 
Simmons and Faulkner. Five months 
ago, Homefinders would have beell 
able to place them m permanent 


housing. Faulkner and Simmons must 
now find alternate forms of rental 
assistance. They can apply to the 
federal government for "Section 8" 
certificates, a subsidy similar to RAP, 
but the number of these subsidies is 
limited. Furthermore, some landlords 
criticize the administration of these 
certificates. Schmidt, for example, will 
not accept 'Section 8' certificates issued 
through the Housing Authority of New 
H aven. More likely, Simmons and 
Faulkner will receive rental vouchers 
for fixed sums. Yet these subsidies do 
not accomodate individuals' income 
limitations. 

Otherwise, Faulkner and Simmons 
may decide to share an apartment with 
other families. Faulkner hopes that by 
combining her income with others, she 
can 
a fford an apartment. 
Such 
overcrowding may be unavoidable. 
"I'm not going out on the streets with 
my son," Faulkner said, "He's only a 
baby. There's no way." 

Faulkner will remain in a shelter 
until May, when her 100 days of 
emergency housing expire. The state 
provides her and all other homeless 
families with three months of 
emergency shelter . Solomon believes 
this 
provision 
disguises 
the 
real 
problem: The state does not guarantee 
permanent housing. 
"There is 
a 
difference between a nght to shelter 
and a right to housing," he said. 
"There is no constitutional or federal 
right to permanent housing. The right 
needs to be established." 

Simmons and Faulkner hope to find 
permanent housing, but the prospects 
remain grim. Simmons believes the 
government is ultimately responsible 
for providing housing. •Tell them to help 
us find a place to live," she said, 
"somebody has got to do it."
