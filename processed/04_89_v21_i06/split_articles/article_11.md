**Livable Solutions Responding to the Housing Crisis**

The last tenant moved out in 1987. 

Since then all 366 apartments of the 
Elm Haven High Rise development 
have remained empty and uninhabi-
table. 

Next 
spring the 
Housing 
Authority of New Haven plans to 
demolish them. 

The Elm Haven 
towers, located just north of the Yale 
campus, epitomize failed 
public 
housing. 

With the demise of developments 
such as Elm Haven, public housing 
cannot adequately serve New Haven's 
low income tenants. Currently the 
number of people on public housing 
waiting lists exceeds the total number 
of existing units. Massive cuts in 
federal funding have also prevented 
further development. The Housing 
Authority has not constructed any new 
units in New Haven since 1986. 

Moreover, 
increasing rents have 
rendered much 
private housing 
prohibitive to low income families. 
Neither the public nor the private 
sector provides sufficient affordable 
housing. Consequently, fifteen 
to 
twenty families become homeless in 
Connecticut each week. One half of 
this burgeoning population lives in New 
Haven.

Faulkner represent the fastest growing

Faulkner, a nineteen-year-old mother 
with a two-month-old son, receives 
$434 monthly from Aid to Families 
with Dependent Children (AFDC), a 
state welfare program. Yet to rent a 
one-bedroom apartment 
in 
New 
Haven, including utilities, costs $555 a 
month. Clearly unable to afford such

an apartment, Faulkner has been in an 
emergency shelter since February. "If I 
could find an apartment; she said, "I 
wouldn't be here." Simmons, a mother 
of two, added, "What you get on 
AFDC makes it virtually impossible to 
find decent ,affordable apartments." 

In New Haven, over 300 families 
currently live in emergency shelters. In 
response to the housing crisis, several 
developers · and philanthropic 
organizations have begun to design 
far-reaching 
solutions. 
Jim 
Rosenberry, 
private developer, 
believes local homelessness stems from 
the 
poor management of public 
housing. "It belongs to everyone so it 
belongs to no one," he explained, citinlZ 
the abandoned Elm Haven High Rises 
as evidence. 

Free of bureaucratic entanglements, 
Rosenberry says he can operate more 
efficiently and more economically. 
Since 1984, 
he 
has developed 
approximately 200 apartments for low· 
income tenants in the New Haven 
area. Because he personally owns the 
property, Rosenberry believes he has 
more incentive to make necessary 
repairs and manage it effectively than 
those administering public housing. 

In March, 
Housing Operation 
Management Enterprises (HOME), 
Inc. , a non-profit organization, bought 
twenty-nine apartments from 
Rosenberry. HOME used a $1 million 
loan from Yale to purchase these units 
located in the Newhallville and Hill 
sections of New Haven. Brett Hill, 
executive director of HOME, hopes 
that by operating these units at cost ~f 
operation, HOME will insulate th1s

property from market rent increases. 

Hill, like Rosenberry, stresses the 
need for careful management. Yet 
HOME's plan is more extensive. By 
involving residents in management 
decisions, such as tenant selection and 
repair priorities, HOME seeks to 
avoid traditional antagonism between 
landlord and tenants. Hill hopes this 
involvement will encourage tenants to 
develop bonds with each other and a 
commitment 
to their building. 

HOME's plan also includes a social 
service coordinator who will help 
tenants with personal and family 
problems. A $55,000 social service 
grant from the New Haven Founda-
tion will allow HOME to make the 
program work. 

Both HOME and Rosenberry offer 
private solutions to the housing crisis. 
Yet 
their success depends upon 
government subsidies. Currently one-
third of HOME's tenants and nearly 
three-fourths of Rosenberry's receive lobbyist for the homeless, the legislature 
publicly funded rental assistance. "The will probably not reinstate the program 
idea of low-income housing becoming because of the current budget crisis. 
totally private is a total myth," said "Anythmg requiring money 
gets 
Robert Solomon, a Yale Law School 
killed." 

In September 
1986, 
homeless 
families overflowed emergency 
housing and moved into a "Tent City" 
on the New Haven Green. The state 
introduced RAP 
to enable 
these 
families to afford permanant housing 
with the greater goal of preventing 
homelessness. RAP subsidies limit rent 
to 30 percent of tenants' monthly 
income. In conjunction with the RAP 
subsidy, 
state established 
Homefinders, 
group of agents 
responsible for securing apartments for 
RAP recipients. 

The state of Connecticut created the 
Rental Assistance Program (RAP), a 
subsidy that fosters the private-public 
balance Solomon advocates, 
three 
years ago. But on January 1, the state 
stopped issuing RAPs. While the state 
will continue to support the 800 
existing RAPs, the present budget 
allocation cannot fund new subsidies.
