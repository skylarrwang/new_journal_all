"You drive them away.

You don't make them

educated, you make 
them hostile." 
requirement similar to Yale's language 
requirement. All Yale undergraduates 
must attain a certain proficiency in a 
foreign language, which they achieve 
by passing an exam or by two years of 
language study at 
Yale. 
Haller 
suggests that students should 
demonstrate a comparable proficiency 
in the sciences. Deficiently prepared 
students would take remedial classes, 
just as those who have had no language 
background start from scratch. 
Novick believes undergraduates 
should have more of a choice. He 
thinks that compelling unprepared 
students to take standard science 
courses defeats the purpose of giving 
them a science education at all. "You 
drive them away. You convince them 
that they're dumb, you teach them all 
the wrong lessons. You don't make 
them more liberally educated. You 
make them hostile." Students like those 
in Novick's course often avoid straight 
introductory science courses because 
they fear the thought of an integral or a 
chemical equation. "You hear all those 
hell stories about people staying up all 
night doing problem sets," said Jamie 
Slaughter OE '91. 
Tougher grading standards also 
deter many students from taking 
courses designed for science majors. 
Substantially fewer A's are awarded in 
Group IV than in Groups I,II or III


(languages, humanities, and social 
sciences). 
While many faculty 
members believe that the rest of the 
college should align 
its grading 
standards with the sciences, others, 
including Crabtree, think the 
sciences ought to align 
their 
grading standards with the humanities. 
Such alignment would 
be 
difficult, 
since the work turned 
in for grading in the two areas 
differs 
radically. 
In the humanities, 
grading tends toward the 
subjective, 
whereas in science 
courses grading is objective. "It's 
a little bit scary because you know 
you can write a paper, but a math 
problem is either right or wrong," 
said Slaughter, a history major. 
Professors who elect to teach science 
courses for non-majors face a uniquely 
difficult task. They want to communicate basic concepts and a love of 
their discipline to a skeptical audience 
which doesn't know the language of 
science. Because many students lack 
confidence in their quantitative skills, 
professors who teach non-majors run 
the risk of alienating their audience if 
they introduce too many formulas. 
Wyman believes part of the solution 
lies in choosing the right books. "What 
one needs are high-level texts that 
really appeal to the intelligence and 
sophistication of the Yale student, but 
which have a different aim from the 
standard texts." 
Eager to assuage students' fears, 
professors offer science without the 
difficult scientific terminology, just as 
one might teach a foreign literature 
without using the original language. 
"You can read Russian literature 
without reading it in 
Russian," 
Wyman said. Yet when professors 
completely remove the language of 
science from their courses, students 
often don't take them seriously, and 
begin to call the courses "guts." After 
working to make their classes more 
accessible, professors like Novick are 
puzzled by this phenomenon. "The 
most effectively taught courses are 
mocked, and if they continue for more 
than a few years they become the 
target of patronizing jokes and put-
down names," Novick said. The gut 
reputations may arise from disagreements among students and faculty 
as to what constitutes an effectively 
taught course. Novick believes that the 
main purpose of a class for non-majors 
is to help students grasp a general 
understanding of science. But some 
students reach for something more 
tangible. 
Elsbach 
expected 
more 
biology, and was disappointed not to 
find it in AIDS and Society. "I don't 
know if Novick went in thinking that it 
should be an easy course," she said. "A 
lot of people thought it was a gut."
