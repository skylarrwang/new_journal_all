a 
sociological study entitled Ctlslomizi_!lg 
the Body, estimates women c9mpnse 
forty percent of the market for tatt~s. 
According to Webb, tattoed celebnttes 
have drawn women into the tattoo 
parlor. •Jn the Sixties it was Janis, 
today 
it's Cher,"

Gonzalez decided to get her tattoos for 
more personal reasons. "I wanted to 
keep up with the guys." she said 
Gonzalez went for her first tattoo 
when she was thirteen. She now has

this view is changing, she says tattooed 
women are still stereotyped. 


SOifte artists believe that Webb 
perpetuates negative stereotypes about 
tattooing and women. Objections 
focus on Webb's use of overtly sexual 
and misogynous imagery. A video of 
his tattoo vampire act is notorimu in
