Coincidentally or not, 
most 
administrators graduated from Yale 
with a Bachelor of Arts degree. "So 
there is this matter of a small built-in

own trustees, faculty, labs, three-year 
degree, and even its own secret 
societies. It wasn't until the Scientific 
and Engineering Schools had both 
returned to graduate status in 1962, 
that Yale College assumed the entire 
responsibility for undergraduate arts 
and sciences. 

While the administration insists that 
changes in admissions policy and 
distributional requirements merely 
reflect a long-standing commitment to 
science at Yale, the traditions of the 
university suggest otherwise. "This is 
an arts university, and the admini-
stration for many years has been 
one sees 
institutions," said Yale 
percent, Stanford 38 percent, and 
Princeton 25 percent. 

Dean of Yale 
College Sidney 
Altman does not foresee that the 
number of science students will ever 
rise dramatically enough to shift the 
focus of Yale's curriculum. He denies 
that the administration's emphasis on 
science this year represents a change in 
Yale's educational philosophy. But 
admitting more science majors could 
exert a 
long-term 
influence on 
university policy, as today's science 
students go on to become professors 
and administrators. Furthermore, 
stricter Group IV requirements 
foreshadow 
standards of scientific 
aptitude for all students. Yale seems to be 
moving away from its tradition as a 
humanities-dominated institution. Science 
Hill might not become the center of 
campus, but Chemistry 115 might 
have to move to a bigger classroom 
next year.
