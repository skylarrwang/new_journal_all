inventive curiosity that inspired 
Whitney nearly two hundred years 
ago. 

"We focus 
on the history of 
technology but present it in a way Eli 
Whitney would have been interested 
in," said Museum Director William 
Brown. With travelling shows and a 
permanent exhibit on the history of the 
grounds, 
the museum 
offers the 
general public both displays of artifacts 
and hands-on experiments. The: 
museum also acts as a resource for 
schools: over 100 school groups have 
visited the Marconi exhibit alone. In 
March the museum helped sponsor 
workshops such as "Bubbles, Balloons 
and Paper Planes," which taught 
educational techniques for making 
science fun. 

Weekend and after-school programs 
taught by Brown and staff offer 
children the chance to experiment with 
technology. Brown believes that 
standard Â·curriculums don't meet th~ 
special interests of mechanically-
inclined children. After kindergarten, 
kids must put away the blocks until 
lOth grade, when they can take shop. 
Brown wanted to provide children a 
chance to design and build, to fill the 
gap left by the schools. In the 
museum's woodshop, kids learn how to 
_work tools. Children, ages six to eight, 
10 one class use rubber bands as motors 
to power toy cars. Another course 
teaches seven-to-nine-year-olds how to 
build wooden robots with lever-driven 
grippers and periscopes. In these 
claases, a child learns by doing. "The 
kids we work with are brilliant students 
if you don't count reading and 
writing," said Brown. He wants the 
students to know that success does not 
require high academic achievement. 
As the museum's bulletin explains: "Eli 
Whitney is remembered not for the 
accomplishments of his Yale education 
but for the practical discoveries he 
made in his workshop." 

These discoveries included new 
methods of industrial organization, 
which Whitney practiced at his gun 
factory in New Haven. Here, he 
regained the fortune he had lost on his 
earlier invention, the cotton gin. In the 
twentieth century, the site passed from 
Whitney's heirs to other manufac-
turers, who used the area as an 
industrial park. During the bicenten-
nial celebrations of 1976, Merrill 
Linsay, 
a 
famous gun collector, 
became interested in founding a 
mu.seum on the old Whitney plant. 
The museum opened in 1984, after 
renovation of the main buildings and 
initial fund-raising. Although the town 
of Hamden and the New Haven water 
company share ownership of the 
property with the museum, it is a 
private institution. Funding comes 
from many sources, including the 
state, the town of Hamden, founda-
tions, and private individuals. 

Brown finds history the best way to 
interest children in technology and 
building. He uses historical examples to 
clarify certain abstract technological 
concepts. The first reservoir built for 
New Haven's water supply stands in 
front of the museum and once powered 
Whitney's mill and factory. Brown 
explains to kids 
that unlike the 
invisible power contained jn elec-
tricity, "back in the 19th century, 
energy is tangible." By restraining and 
channelling water, a millwheel and 
dam concretely show the flow of energy 
on a large scale. Children can compare 
the waterworks to an electrical circuit, 
where the minute size of electrons 
makes the flow of power invisible. 
Analogies such as this aim to make 
technology accessible to students. 
Brown hopes to encourage such 
involvement. He wants students to 
learn culture and history not only as 
printed works and music, but also as 
"what people do mechanically."
