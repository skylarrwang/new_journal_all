Baby Talk 
Twenty-five-month-old Robyn Levine 
gurgles happily as she gazes at the 
television screens. "Look! The bunny 
is gorping the duck! See, the bunny is 
gorping the duck," says a coaxing 
voice. Robyn's eyes dart from one 
screen 
to the other, 
periodically 
focusing on the yellow light bulb in the 
center. A student, peering through a 
small opening above the screens, 
anxiously tries to follow the baby's eyes 
and records the rapid movement by 
pressing hand-held buttons. The "duck 
and 
bunny show" entrances 
yet 
another eager visitor to the Yale Infant 
Language Lab. 

The show is Assistant Professor of 
Psychology Letitia Naigles' newest 
inquiry into infant language 
acquisition. "The question is how 
someone who won't sit still and won't 
follow directions somehow manages to 
learn this incredibly complex thing 
called language," Naigles muses. 

Learning an average of five to ten new 
words a day, a child will have acquired 
a vocabulary of 60,000 words by the 
age of five. Psycholinguists still do not 
fully understand this process. Whereas 
previous language researchers focused 
on production of speech, Naigles 
concentrates on comprehension. "'The 
infants probably understand a great 
deal more than they actually say," she 
explains. Specifically, she examines 
how syntax influences an infant's 
ability to understand individual words. 

N aigles' innovative experiment 
simulates the 
process by which 
children learn verbs. To prepare her 
experiment, Naigles choreographs 
combinations of movements which 
cannot be named with a single existing 
word. 

Next, 
Naigles films 
two 
assistants as they perform her unusual 
aerobic combinatic;ms; one wearing a 
duck costume and the other a bunny 
costume. 

Naigles plays the duck and bunny 
video for the infant, while her taped 
voice introduces nonsense words such 
as "blikking" or "kradding." These 
terms correspond to the movements in 
the video. After the child hears "The 
bunny is kradding the duck!" several 
times and watches the corresponding 
two-part motion, the displays change. 
On one screen the duck and bunny 
make arm circles in unison. On the 
other the bunny pushes the duck's 
head. The taped voice then asks the 
infant "Where's kradding? 
Find 
kradding!" As the infant looks from 
one screen to the other a hidden 
assistant records the amount of time 
the infant focuses on each screen. 

Using this information, Naigles will 
determine whether the infant has 
understood the new word. 

N aigles bases her research on the 
"preferential looking paradigm", 
developed by Dr. Roberta Golinkoff of 
The New journal/April 21 , 1989 5

the University of Delaware and Dr. 
Kathryn 
Hirsh-Pasek of Temple 
University. The paradigm equates 
looking and understanding. Naigles 
uses this model to test her hypothesis 
that if the child understands the 
original sentence, she will have learned 
that "kradding" refers to a causal 
action. She will know that "the bunny 
is kradding the duck" refers to the screen 
'!Vhere the bunny pushes the duck's 
head, and will look at this screen when 
asked "Where's kradding? 
kra4ding!" 

The main advantage of Naigles' 
method is that it requires little active 
participation by the subject . . Her 
technique makes it possible to study 
language acquisition more effectively 
in children with physical handicaps 
and infants. Naigles believes that 
physical and developmental factors 
may prevent children from verbalizing 
as much as they can understand. A 
two-year-old who speaks only in three-
word utterances will respond to much 
more complex sentences. A physical 
handicap also may impair a child's 
ability to speak. By focusing on 
comprehension instead of speech 
production, Naigles avoids demanding 
that infants perform impossible 
linguistic tasks. Researchers at other 
universities use this method to study 
comprehension 
m 
children with 
cerebral palsy. 

Naigles' method also improves upon 
earlier comprehension-based experi-
ments which required infants to act out 
what they heard with toys. Sophis-
ticated video and audio technology 
allows Naigles to set up experiments 
which provide more accurate indi-
cations of an infant's comprehension. 
Having the child act out what she hears 
introduces factors such as fascination 
with the toys she uses, which could 
interfere with the child's ability to 
recreate what she has just heard. "We 
can see more clearly what they know 
about language and sentence structure 
with minimal context," Naigles said. 

In the future, Naigles hopes to 
expand her investigation by 
incorporating a study on infants' 
understanding of passive sentences. 
She also plans to examine the linguistic 
differences between children raised in 
Spanish-speaking households and 
those 
raised 
in English-speaking 
households. 

To find participants for her present 
and future research, Naigles' student 
volunteers look for infants through 
local birth announcements. Once 
contacted, interested families will 
bring their children to Naigles' offices, 
located in the basement of Sheffield-
Sterling-Strathcona Hall. 

Each 
session, which involves both the infant . 
and one 
parent, 
lasts 
about 45 
minutes. Afterwards . Naigles replays 
video 
for the parent while 
explaining its role in her studies. In 
exchange for donating their time .. 
parents may gain insight into the way 
their children Â·learn language. The kids 
get a t-shirt emblazoned with the Yale 
crest and the motto "Graduate of Yale 
Infant Studies."
