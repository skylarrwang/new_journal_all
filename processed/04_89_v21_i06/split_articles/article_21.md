EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
be thoroughly reported by the local 
press. This would have the important 
added benefit of giving public 
exposure to candidates who do not 
have wealthy contributors to pay for 
the advertising necessary for a citywide 
campaign. 


There will be no shortage of issues 
for 
this candidate debate. The 
following are just some of the most 
pressing: 

Thanks in part to a large drop in 
state subsidies, the next mayor will 
inherit an enormous budget deficit. 
This will put great pressure on the new 
mayor to continue DiLieto's program 
of subsidizing downtown development 
in order to increase the city's tax base. 
Mayoral candidates should debate the 
wisdom of continuing DiLieto's 
development policies at the expense·of 
the city's social services budget to deal 
with problems of hunger, homeless-
ness, and crime. 

A key question concerning New 
Haven's fiscal crisis involves Yale 
University's responsibility to the city. 
DiLieto steadfastly refused to ask Yale 
to pay for the services it consumed, nor 
did he attempt to tax the institution . 
With state coffers empty and the state 
unable to adequately reimburse New 
Haven for tax revenues lost because of 
:ale, this campaign should reopen the 
Issue of town-gown relations. 

DiLieto seemed content to stall 
action on the city's solid waste 
problems until the state stepped in and 
forced New Haven to join in its trash 
incineration scheme. Candidates must 
say where they will resist trash burning 
and commit the city to recycling as a 
safer solution to its solid waste crisis. 

A mayoral candidate must present a 
program for greater control over the 
city's school budget by elected officials. 
The idea of an elected rather than an 
appointed Board of Education as a way 
to achieve more public accountability 
needs 
full debate in 
this year's 

Now is the time for a funda-
mental assessment of city govern-
ment. City hiring policies need to be 
changed to remove the final vestiges of 
the political patronage system. The 
policy of award~g contracts on the 
basis of campaign contributions must 
end. The merits of a sweeping revision 
of the charter for New Haven's city 
government should be discussed in the 
1989 campaign. 

Getting the candidates to debate the 
issues is only part of the solution to 
New Haven's political problems. It is 
also up to the city's voters to educate 
themselves on the issues and lobby the 
candidates to take clear and construc-
tive 
positions. To counteract the 
organizational power of the old city 
machine, more citizens than ever 
before must give generously of their 
time and money in the upcoming 

The retirement of Ben DiLieto does 
not mean the automatic end to the 
policies that have governed New 
Haven for the past decade. Unless we 
demand that this fall's candidates make 
the election a referendum on the 
DiLieto years, the policies of his failed 
administration just might continue to 
govern the city by default.
