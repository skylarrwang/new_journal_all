largely black and Puerto Rican public 
school students. Although a budget 
compromise was finally reached, the 
political rift between DiLieto and Dow 
and Edmonds has not healed. Over the 
past few years, the New Haven school 
system has built up its own separate 
patronage network, which Dow and 
Edmonds have thrown behind the 
campaign of DiLieto challenger, John 
Daniels. For the first time, because of 
the racial context of the Tyson and the 
school battles, the black community is 
united to an unprecented degree in 
their desire to remove DiLieto. 

During the past few months, the 
DiLieto administration has been 
embarrassed by allegations of cor-
ruption and cronyism. The local 
N.A.A.C.P. 
chapter charged that 
DiLieto's Executive Assistant Joseph 
Carbone used his office to profit in real 
estate speculations. Other critics 
attacked the awarding of a $25,000 city 
development grant 
to 
a 
Dixwell 
Avenue church headed by a pro-
DiLieto black minister. Even the 
previously slavishly pro-DiLieto daily 
newpaper, The New Haven Register, 
recently printed a few critical stories on 
the ethics of the DiLieto admini-
stration. 

Despite mounting problems , 
DiLieto was the odds-on favorite 
among 
political 
observers in the 
upcoming election. The Democratic 
Party was firmly in his control and 
remained capable of turning out huge 
majorities for its candidates in the city's 
heavily Italian-American wards east of 
the Quinnipiac River. At the same 
time, the mayor retained his legendary 
popularity among New Raven's large 
senior citizen voting block. DiLieto 
could count on support from the city's 
municipal unions (except for teachers), 
who knew who was their boss, and the 
construction trade unions, who pro-
fited 
by DiL ieto's program of 
subsidizing downtown construction. 

Even without the services of Mauro as 
his chief fundraiser, DiLieto would 
have gotten lucrative financial 
contributions from businesses that 
have done and expect to continue 
doing business with the city. 

Still, DiLieto stepped down. He 
might have sensed that this election 
would be harder fought than any since 
he ousted Logue a decade ago. H is 
policies would have received more 
careful scrutiny and louder criticism 
than ever before. As a man who clearly 
enjoys his personal popularity, the 
price of victory in a contest such as that 
might have seemed too high. By re-
tiring as the undefeated champion of 
New Haven politics, DiLieto remains 
in a strong position to influence the 
choice of his .successor and thereby the 
future city policies. And therein lies 
the rub. 

The immediate beneficiary of 
DiLieto's withdrawal is John Daniels. 
He had already begun to put together a 
campaign based primarily in the city's 
black wards but with some prominent 
white supporters, such as former 
alderman Edward Zelinsky and 
Cynthia Savo, former publisher of The 
Independent, a local weekly news-
paper. In early campaign statements, 
Daniels criticized the mayor for 
ignoring the needs of poor and 
minority neighborhoods while concen-
trating resources on downtown 
development. Daniels' rhetoric was 
relatively mild, 
however, and he 
probably can still court DiLieto's white 
political supporters. This effort already 
seems underway; 
when Daniels 
responded to DiLieto's withdrawal 
announcement, he praised his 
departing rival as a great "builder" of 
the city. 

Because of his non-
confrontational 
style, 
Daniels also 
appears to 
have 
retained cordial 
relations with Arthur T. Barbieri, the 
reputed Democratic boss of the 1960's, 
who stepped in to replace Mauro as 
Town Committee Chair. 

There is
