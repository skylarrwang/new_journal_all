EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Grasping the tattoo gun between 
rubber-gloved fingers_, Spider Webb 
dips its needle into a paper container 
full of thick black pigment. He steps 
down on the foot pedal and presses the 
tip of the needle into a young woman's 
tan shoulder. Staccato bursts from the 
gun drown out the strains of Poison's 
"Fallen Angel" pouring out of a color 
television set. Webb has worked on the 
woman's tattoo for more than an hour. 
As he adds streaks of yellow, black, red 
and white ink, a tiger's head slowly 
emerges. With each additional stroke, 
the image comes into sharper focus. 
Bottles of pigment, discarded brushes 
and disposable 
razors clutter the 
countertop. At the other end of the 
counter, Andrew "Zee" Sistrand, 
Webb's assistant, tattoos the outline of 
a unicorn onto another woman's back. 
The Spider Webb studio in Derby 
can draw its customers on name alone. 
Webb's original art is included in 
national body art exhibitions. He is 
known for work such as the first three· 
dimensional tattoo and "X-1000," a 
conceptual piece in which he tattooed 
x's on a thousand people. He has 
written six books on tattoo art, several 
of which were printed by major 
publishing houses. Of New Haven's 
three tattoo artists, only Webb enjoys a 
national audience, and articles on 
him have appeared in magazines 
ranging from 
The New 
Yorker to 
Pmtiwuse. 
New 
Ha~en's other two tattoo 
studios, while lacking Webb's fame, 
hue their image on consistent, if 
undramatic, professionalism. Imperial 
Illustrations bills itself as the most 
caring tattoo studio in Connecticut. 
The owners, Joe and Debbie Vitelli, 
stress their use of hospital-quality 
sterilization equipment. Jim Stellato, 
owner of Big Jim's Papillon, touts his 
studio's exceptional level of cleanliness. 


Tattoo studios emphasize their 
fastidiousness to assuage public fears of 
the AIDS virus. Ironically, the Center 
for Disease Control (CDC) asserts that 
tattooing's ma,jor health risk is not 
"We won't just slam 
design number 372 on 
people here. Every 
tattoo is an original 
creation." 
HIV infection. According to CDC 
research, 
no 
one has 
reported 
contracting AIDS from a tattoo needle. 
The most significant health hazard for 
tattoo artists and their customers is 
contraction of either staph infection or 
hepatitis-B. Unlike the AIDS virus 
which is weak outside the body, 
hepatitis-B can live on the tip of a 
nec;dle for several days. Local artists 
are well acquainted with the dangers of 
this disease. In the late Seventies, city 
officials closed down New Haven's first 
studio, "The Illustrated Man," after 
several customers contracted hepatitis. 
The owners of New Haven's three 
current studios 
say 
that their 
establishments have had no incidents 
of serious infection. At Papillon, the 
artists use disposable needles. They 
sterilize the rest of their equipment in 
an autoclave, a heat and pressure 
sterilizer. Webb uses a similar system. 
At Imperial, the Vitellis disinfect their 
equipment with a Chemiclave 5000, a 
more modern version of the autoclave. 
Attention to health is only part of the 
tattooists' efforts to maintain a good 
relationship with customers. This 
relationship begins when the customer 
selects a design. The Vitellis find that 
clients most often choose images of 
panthers, roses, hearts, grim reapers 
and cartoon characters. Joe Vitelli sees 
a common theme in the customers' 
selections. Most people get tattoos 
during times of stress, he explains, 
and the subject matter reflects this. 
Joe Vitelli tries to dissuade first-time 
customers from 
choosing demons, 
skulls, 
Asian 
dragons or names. 
"About 60 percent of the coverup work 
we do is concealing names," he said. At 
Imperial and Papillon, clients can 
request custom designs or pick from 
standard sketches called flashes. Joe 
Vitelli stressed that clients who request 
flashwork rarely tolerate any embel-
lishment. "If they ask for a cartoon 
character, it's got to look like Hannah 
Barbara drew it themselves." 


Striving for 
truer personal 
expression, Webb refuses to tattoo 
requests for devil tattoos because he is a 
born-again Christian. 
flash. "We won't just slam design 
number 372 on people here. Every 
tattoo 
is an original creation." 
Although customers bring him 
drawings and photographs, Webb 
translates these images into his style. 
Barring any ethical conflicts, the 
tattooing begins when the customer 
either selects a flash or approves the 
artist's sketch. The physical experience 
of being tattooed varies from person to 
person. Vitelli likens the feeling to 
having sunburned skin. 
Some 
customers encounter a much higher 
level of discomfort. Laura Gonzalez 
(BR '89) described her three tattooing 
experiences as painful and nauseating. 
Although tattoo artists try to prepare 
their clients, 
Webb doubts the 
helpfulness of any explanation. "It's 
like talking about sex to a virgin." 

"We've got my artwork in books and 
photographs that they can look at. If 
they don't like my work, I can refer 
them to somebody else." 
Spider Webb, unlike Stellato or the 
Vitellis, 
avoids making value 
judgements about 
subject 
matter. 
"There's nothing I won't draw or do for 
money," 
he 
said. 
As 
practicing 
Catholics, the Vitellis will not sketch 
upside-down crosses or 666 signs. 
They also refuse to tattoo swastikas or 
anti-Semitic images. Although willing 
to draw swastikas, Stellato turns down


In applying the tattoo, the artist first 
draws an outline with black pigment. 
After completing the outline, be adds 
color by moving the vibrating needle from one corner of the tattoo to the 
other. If the artist needles one spot for too long or allows the client's body to absorb the shock, keloid scars can 
develop. 
Tattooists learn technical skills such 
as scar prevention in an apprenticeship 
program. "You can't just buy a tattoo kit 
from the back of Easy Rider magazine 
and start tattooing," Joe Vitelli said. •It 
doesn't work that way." While admit-
ting apprenticeships provide the basic 
skills, 
Webb finds this training 
inadequate. 
He believes that 
apprentices should receive formal 
instruction to become more artistically 
refined. 
Webb credits his alma 
maters- the School of Visual Arts in 
New York City and the University of 
Guanajuato in Mexico- for his 
stylistic complexity. Only in art school 
will other tattoo artists, Webb believes, 
reach a level of artistic sophistication 
comparable to his own. 
Webb has developed a distinct style. 
Placement of the tattoo is central to his 
art. A photograph of a dragon tattoo 
etched by Webb reveals how he models 
his work to the shape of his subject's 
body. The dragon winds around a 
woman's right shoulder to her left hip, 
following the curves of her breast and 
midrift. The foreshortening of the 
dragon conveys depth and motion. 
Fantastical images appear often in 
Webb's work. He draws dragons, 
winged creatures, 
serpents, 
and 
medieval warriors.

number of regional styles, from the

styles mdicates the centralization of the 
modern body art world. National 
tattoo conventions bring together 
artists from different parts of the 
country, and blur regional distinc-
tions, explains Karen lndeck, curator 
of Gallery 400 in Chicago.
