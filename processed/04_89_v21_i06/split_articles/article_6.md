Young Music Masters 
High-pitched 
tones 
and evenly-
executed beats drift out over College 
Street. These sounds emanate from the 
instruments of a hard-working group 
of graduate students at the Yale School 
of Music. But for a small minority of 
the school's 150 students, the term 
"graduate student" does not seem quite 
applicable. Four violinists and four 
cellists practicing with the rest of the 
group came here directly from high 
school. 

These 
students 
are part of a 
program 
for gifted high school 
graduates called the Certificate in 
Performance, a three-year tract within 
the School of Music. Yale's music 
school 
does 
not normally admit 
undergraduates. As a result, many 
talented players are lost to other 
conservatories like Juilliard and 
Curtis. Professors at Yale started the 
Certificate program because they 
wanted to begin working with younger 
musicians in order to mold their 
techniques. 

Applicants to the Yale Certificate 
Program undergo a rigorous admis-
sions process, including a series of 
taped 
and live 
auditions. 
After 
entering the program, students find 
that the intensity continues. Besides 
taking private lessons with famous 
faculty, Certificate students perform in 
the Yale Philharmonia, chamber en-
sembles) and master classes. They are 
also required to take one additional 
academic course. In contrast to the 
grading scale in Yale College where a 
grade of D- or above is adequate for 
. credit, the Certificate program only 
considers a B- or higher as a passing 
mark. The intensity of the program, 
and its reputation, leave Certificate 
graduates well-prepared for pro-
fessional careers in music. 

Most of these young mustctans 
already have a lot of performing 
experience when they arrive at Yale. 
Alexis Gerlach, the your)gest member 
of the Certificate Program, began 
+ The New Journal/April 21, 1989 
playing the cello at age six. At age 
eighteen she has performed in Brazil, 
Taiwan, England, and Italy. 

Gerlach came to Yale, like most of 
the Certificate students, for the high-
caliber faculty. She currently works 
with world-famous cellist Aldo Perisot. 
Another reason many students choose 
Yale's program over a conservatory is 
the chance to live in a university 
community. "I can't do only music," 
said violinist Katie Bauer. "As much as 
I love it, it is not the absolute be-ali 
and end-all of everything." 

But living with the graduate 
musicians in Helen Hadley Hall, the 
institutional-looking dormitory on 
Temple Street, can be lonely. Some 
Certificate students say they · feel left 
out of the experience of normal 
undergraduates. "I walked 
into 
Silliman and was struck by how 
different it was," said Bauer. "I really 
wish I could know more people my 
age." 

Having completed the Yale pro-
gram, Certificate students usually go 
on to obtain a bachelor's degree at 
another institution. Afterwards, they 
can petition the School of Music 
faculty to turn their certificate into a 
master's degree. Jason Rubinstein, 
who graduated from the program in 
1988, is working with Stephen Epstein, 
a leader in the 
field of record 
engineering, at CBS Masterworks. He 
is simultaneously completing his 
bachelor's degree at New York 
University. Bauer hopes to enroll in 
Yale College after she finishes the 
Certificate program, 
and Gerlach 
plans to attend a conservatory. Both 
want a career in music performance, 
Bauer in chamber music and Gerlach 
as a concert soloist.
