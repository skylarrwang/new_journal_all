"Admit a class . . . 
who can go through a 
Group-IV course 
without feeling this is 
a life-threatening, 
soul-destroying 
proposition." 

"It was huge," said Tasha Elsbach (BR 
'91) of Alvin Novick's popular AIDS 
and Society course. But Novick's class 
wasn't the only science course to draw 
a crowd this fall. Many undergra-
duates would be surprised to know that 
students filled the aisles of 110 Sterling 
Chemistry Lab for Peter Moore's 
Comprehensive General C hemistry, a 
required cou rse for chemistry majors. 
Moreover, some members of the Yale 
community are taking steps to make 
courses like Moore's even larger. 
Last year, administrators decided to 
increase the number of science 
students at Yale. Dean of Admissions 
Worth David asked the Office of 
I nstitutional Research (OIR) to 
conduct a study that would determine 
which applicants would most likely 
major in the sciences. As a new policy, 
the Admissions Committee gave 
preferential treatment to those whom 
the O IR labeled potential scientists. As 
a result, Yale accepted almost 10 
percent more science students than it 
had in 1987. 
But only a fraction of those admitted 
actually matriculated to Yale. Many 
serious students of science, math, and 
engineering still chose universities with 
stronger reputations in those fields. At 
Yale, the sciences continue to suffer 
from an underdog image as they fight 
for stature beside the humanities. High 
school guidance counselors encourage 
their students to apply to Yale for the 
liberal arts, but advise potential 
science majors to _apply elsewhere.

D irector of

Crabtree 
visited 
high schools to 
promote Yale's science departments, 
he was surprised by how openly the
