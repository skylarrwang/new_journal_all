contribution to a broader knowledge. 
Schmidt regards Yale's distribu-
tional requirements as the mechanism 
that assures breadth in a Yale College 
education. 

Yet 
this 
breadth is 
antagonistic to the integrated under-
standing he also insists students must 
have. The four groups into which all 
classes fall divide Yale's education into 
a checklist from which students must 
choose some of this group, some of 
that. By reducing knowledge to this 
checklist, students might know what to 
learn- a grasp of another language by 
the end of year four, a Group III next 
semester. But for students to be able to 
leave Yale aware of how to learn, they 
need to see relationships between the 
subjects they study. In the end, Yale 
students should believe that their 
experience has bred more than an 
intellectual expansion. They should 
feel 
they achieved an 
intellectual 
coherence as well. 

A new program is trying to piece 
together Yale's fragmen.ts. Shortly after 
most students had left for the summer, 
Schmidt announced the University's 
new interdisciplinary initiative, the 
Program in Public Philosophy and 
Ethics (PPE). PPE will address general 
questions concerning "the public" for 
both study and research. Still in the 
planning stages, PPE will begin next 
fall. 

This mlttative will create an 
undergraduate major called Politics, 
Philosophy, 
and Economics. The 
major, going by the same initials, will 
replace the existing hybrid major of 
Economics and Political Science, if 
approved by the faculty and the Yale 
Corporation. Whereas Economics and 
Political Science combines courses and 
faculty from the two parent majors, the 
proposed PPE major will have its own 
faculty and courses indigenous to the 
depanment. 

The other branch of the PPE 
proposal, the Public Philosophy and 
Ethics program, will create a union of 
faculty and students from existing 
sraduate and professional schools. By 
establishing a strong presence at the 
lhduate level, PPE hopes to initiate 
intellectual discussion with other 
centers 
for specialized 
study on 
campus. With these exchanges in 
place, PPE Director and Political 
Science Professor Douglas Rae says, 
"People can think about questions 
without translating back into 
th~ir 
disciplinary argot at every stage." 

I n 
organizing this 
program , 
Schmidt, Rae, and other PPE support-
ers are responding directly to the 
academic barriers withi n 
the 
University. The words "Politics," 
"Philosophy," and "Economics" in the 
name of the proposed major reflect the 
organizers' belief that scholarship 
benefits from smoothing over aca-
demic divisions. PPE attempts to 
redefine departmental boundaries that 
exist throughout the University by 
aiming at their points of intersection. 

Other Yale 
departments 
have 
worked in the past to fuse academic 
disciplines and have enjoyed success. 
Majors such as Women's Studies, 
African and Afro-American Studies, 
American Studies, and Humanities 
bring together different specializations 
under their headings. Yet the PPE 
major seems even more broadly con-
ceived than any of these. Whereas the 
creatjon of those earlier interdiscipli-
nary departments reflected their entry 
into formal academia, PPE is more 
than an embrace of unexplored subject 
matter. The major takes a 
new 
scholarly approach by applying several 
perspectives to several subjects. Using 
the notion of "the public" as a 
cornerstone, the major will not only 
link the well-established political 
science, philosophy, and economics 
departments, but will also claim for 
itself all that they individually teach. It 
will not add an extra house to the 
neighborhood, but rather will organize 
the existing homes as if property lines 
did not matter. 

As programs like PPE gain entry to 
universities, cross-disciplinary 
thinking will claim a larger role in 
academia. Jaroslav Pelikan, Sterling 
Professor of H istory, says the most 
significant scholarly insights over the 
past 20 years have come from the 
borders of disciplines. The scholars in 
such positions note the evidence and 
methods of other fields in order to 
learn about their own. Howard Stern, 
a lecturer in the German department, 
has done the same by investigating the 
common ground between such appar-
ently separate subjects as mathematics 
and literature. 

Stern believes that one can discover 
mathematical principles in works of 
literature. A close examination of 
mathematics reveals analogies to 
literary analysis and provides new 
means for interpretation, he says. 
Stern cites Cervantes' Don Quixote, in 
which, in the second part of the novel, 
the characters read their own story 
from the first. This self-reference could 
simply be called magic. Or, according 
to Stern, "We can see that there is a 
very simple mathematical way to 
organize that magic using (the branch 
of analytic geometry called) topology." 

Literature is currently understood 
using perspectives from 
history, 
sociology, 
linguistics, 
art, and 
philosophy. "Literary studies are 
always enriched by invoking other 
disciplines," Stern says. He feels math 
has a place, too. 

To President Schmidt, institutional 
efforts like PPE and individual efforts 
like Stern's reflect a burgeoning sense 
of academic community at Yale. The 
nourishing of these connections within 
the University produces new bases for 
scholarship and faculty research. 
Schmidt cites recent developments in 
biophysics and biochemistry, progress 
in molecular medicine, and increased 
dialogue between the humanities and 
the social sciences. The challenge is to 
find a way to open this academic 
community to the students. Pelikan 
points out that the seeds for scholarly 
breakthroughs often 
come from 
students in class discussions and in 
essays. In a truly productive and 
coherent academic community, all 
members are involved. Students must 
not feel that they are silently passing 
through Yale's course machinery, but 
rather that they are holding several 
academic conversations at once. 

For the students then, majors like 
PPE and teachers like Stern encourage 
a more expansive way of thinking. But 
these studies come with warning 
labels, both for the students and the 
professors. Poorly conceived, cross-
disciplinary 
work can promote 
obfuscation 
instead of creative 
thinking. Although Stern uses math to 
understand 
literature, 
he warns 
against 
confusing 
two. 
Each 
discipline has different founding 
principles at stake: "(In mathematics) 
the theoretical structure is immediately 
usable for higher-level theory, but 
literary theory does not have this 
power. You never move on to a higher-
order Ulysses," he says. 

Interdisciplinary study also risks 
confusing students, particularly if they 
lack enough knowledge in an area to 
go comfortably beyond. Dan Sod-
ickson (TD '88), last year's Warren 
Prize winner for the Humanities, spent 
his four undergraduate years balan- Â· 
cing interdisciplinary work in the 
Humanities with highly disciplined 
study in Physics. He sometimes felt his 
Humanities seminars were so full of 
variety that they never quite cohered. 
"They coagulated into a big knot where 
you lost everything," he says. Ruth 
Marcus, a professor of philosophy, 
calls this "being interdisciplinary for 
interdisciplinary's sake." Those who 
chase an abstract goal like inter-
disciplinary knowledge often have a 
misguided devotion 
to large-scale 
theorizing. 

Marcus feels 
that the 
relevant carry-over from one discipline 
to another will naturally evolve in the 
classroom, and that sustained pursuit 
of these connections will confuse and 
distract students. She believes that 
students should expect to graduate 
with large gaps in their knowledge: 
Marcus fears that in trying to make 
connections 
between 
subjects, 
students may lose all grasp of their 
content. 

This concern articulates a common 
criticism of interdisciplinary studies. 
But by the same token, in expecting 
boundaries to give out by themselves, 
M arcus falls on faulty logic. She 
removes the onus from both teacher 
and student to look 
beyond the 
academic divisions that entrench the 
educational system. Without a dedi-
cation to challenging these barriers, 
fragmented studies will remain the 
status quo. The promise of interdisci-
plinary programs cannot be fulfilled 
unless both teacher and student walk 
into class prepared to test boundaries 
and to shift perspectives. 

Interdisciplinary programs rest their 
underlying philosophies on the useful-
ness of knowledge. Schmidt says, 
)Knowledge} is a good, of and in 
lbelf .... [It} answers no questions of 
utility, of relevance, of social value." 
He feels this position defends liberal 
education from the narrow thinking of 
careerism and pre-professionalism. 
But students gain by having a strong 
connection to the world, rather than 
lllerely an intellectual refuge. Inter-
disciplinary study develops sophisti-
cated resources for problem-solving. 
Today, the questions to be answered 
require information from other fields 
and not just the insider's view of a 
single topic. The bringing together of 
disciplines at the undergraduate level 
squeezes 
a 
college education of 
everything it has and still addresses the 
needs of developing scholars. 

As the administration and faculty 
become more receptive to making 
education a cross-section of ideas, 
students must unlearn the high school 
lesson that learning is divided into 
discrete subjects. Why not an inter-
disciplinary directive in the Yale College 
Programs of Study? It could tell incoming 
students to look forward to making 
insights not only within a speciali-
zation but also between subjects of 
study. They would learn that students 
should try to see their classes not as five 
different projects, but as different 
extensions of the same enterprise. 

As the University finds better means 
for linking its specialties, the education 
it offers students will improve. Stu-
dents will be able to approach their 
education 
not 
with 
hesitation or 
whimsy-two common 
pitfalls 
in 
course selection- but with the excite-
ment of taking on a single challenge. 
The challenge for now, both for the 
University and the students, is to find 
an innovative approach to creating 
that coherent education. As PPE will 
show, subjects of different content will 
find common ground in the minds of 
students.
