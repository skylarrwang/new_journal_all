Under the ornate ceiling of Woolsey 
Hall and below the orderly rows 
of wooden 
benches, 
Nicholas 
Thompson-Allen and Joseph Dzeda, 
Yale's curators of organs, can hardly 
move. In their cluttered, subterranean 
workshop, they clean and repair Yale's 
14 organs. Benches, organ pipes, and 
bottle brushes crowd the room. The 
curators' most cumbersome task is 
maintammg Woolsey's towering 
centerpiece-the 12,573-pipe Newberry 
Memorial organ. 

A 40-year-old photograph hanging 
on the wall shows the workshop 
basically unchanged. Even the tea cans 
stacked on the shelves are the same. 
Many of the tools Dzeda and Thomp-
son-Allen use came from the former 
curators; the workshop today remains 
distinctly low-tech. 

Dzeda and 
Thompson-Allen have resisted 
experimenting with new materials. 
They stuck with leather diaphragms 
when other curators tried plastic, 
which Dzeda points out, deteriorates 
too quickly. When curators from other 
schools alter the organs according to the 
ruling fashion, he said, they com-
promise the instruments' quality. "You 
wouldn't repaint a Rembrandt to match 
new, yellow walls in the house. But 
that's essentially what has been done to 
the organs at these other schools." 

Even though Dzeda and Thompson-
Allen pamper their organs with old-
fashioned care, they cannot protect the 
instruments from old age. Over time, 
the diaphragms that control the organs' 
valves dry out and rupture, which 
distorts the sound. Before dismantling 
the delicate instruments, the curators 
usually wait until several problems 
accumulate. "The organs are happiest 
when left alone," Dzeda said. 

That can mean waiting anywhere 
between 25 and 50 years, when the 
organs get their regular pipe cleaning. 
But even with this long grace period, 
the curators have fallen somewhat

behind. In fact, thousands of the 
Newberry Memorial organ's pipes 
have gone unwashed since 1928. 

The cleaning process hasn't changed 
much over the intervening years. Like 
their predecessors, Dzeda and 
Thompson-Allen carry the pipes to the 
basement and scrub each one using 
bottle brushes and hot water. After re-
installing the pipes, Thompson-Allen 
performs a technique called "voicing" 
to regulate the force and response of 
the sound. 

Thompson-Allen learned this 
method from his father, Aubrey, who 
was the third organ curator in Yale's 
history. Both Dzeda and Thompson-
Allen trained with Aubrey before 
taking over as associate curators in 
1973. The two men also run the 
Thompson-Allen Company, which re-
pairs organs throughout Connecticut. 

The curators have embraced tradi-
tion over innovation. They want 
future generations to see, hear, and 
play the organs the way the Yale 
community enjoys them today. And 
although it creates more work for him, 
Dzeda believes that everyone should 
have access to the organs. "These are 
not museum pieces," he said-even 
though he still considers himself a 
curator.

John Parker speaks with urgency and 
passion about the AIDS threat facing 
intravenous (IV) 
drug abusers. 
"People say drug addicts can't change 
their behavior. But there's still time to 
reach addicts that don't know the 
facts," he said. "We need to do it now." 
As a 34-year-old, reformed heroin 
addict, ex-con, and master's candidate 
at the Yale School of Epidemiology and 
Public Health, 
Parker knows the 
addict's plight. In a controversial, self-
funded campaign that defies Connecti-
