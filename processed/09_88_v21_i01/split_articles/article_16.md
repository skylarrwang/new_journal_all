"Why is it that very 
educated, highly 
intellectual people give 
their life like nothing 
to Baha'u'llah? Can 
you find a scholar 
today willing to give 
his life for Plato?"


The room is nothing out of the 
ordinary. There are scattered floor 
pillows, a grand piano, and a large 
sofa. But tonight East meets West in 
this New Haven living room, where 
Cheryl Khavari hosts a Baha'i Faith 
fireside. An emeritus professor, a law 
student, and a New Haven area grade 
school teacher gather to share stories, 
prayers, and questions with others in 
the group. 


Khavari periodically 
consults her notes and prayer books u 
she guides the discussion on the â€¢Baha'i 
Way of Life." 


Once every two weeks, several of the 
20 Baha'is from the New Haven and 
Yale communities gather for a fireside 
meeting of prayer and discussion. The 
Baha'i Faith, an eastern religion that 
hu enjoyed quiet growth in the United 
States over the past century, shuns 
ritual, dogma, and theological contro-
versy. With no organized clergy, 
participants take an active role in 
worship at the fireside meetings. The 
religion forbids proselytizing; the 
firesides serve to communicate the 
teachings of the faith to people of other 
religious backgrounds and are open to 
all who are interested.
