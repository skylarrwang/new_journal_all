usually condescending. Critics ignored

To combat this denial, many women

subverts Freud's theory that the young 
girl must turn from her mother as love 
object to her father. Gilbert and Gubar 
suggest that the arrival of the impotent 
male hero meant that fathers could 
~y appear as weak figures whose 
tnfluence might 
be overcome . 

Gradually, women writers were able to 
come into their own and find the 
female tradition that had been hidden. 
Affiliation, as defined by Gilbert 
and Gubar, is a positive move for a 
female writer. It is a fantasy in which 
an author is able to forge a bond across 
time with a literary ancestor. But 
Gilbert and Gubar feel that such a 
bond can only be achieved in the genre 
of criticism, which is not bound by 
narrative constraints. In the novel, as 
they see it, "each event inexorably 
leads to another" and thus the author 
can never step outside the linear 
progression of time. When successful, 
affiliation should result in a truly 
timeless moment. 

That Gilbert and Gubar would place 
such emphasis on this timeless moment 
is bewildering. The concept implies a 
literary standstill, in which a text's 
meaning becomes faxed. Yet do such 
moments really exist in literature? 
Reading and re-reading, which bring 
constantly changing interpretations, 
challenge any notion of literary stasis. 
Gilbert and Gubar avoid this issue 
simply by neglecting the reader 
altogether. This is the flaw which runs 
throughout The War of tlu Words, and 
which in the end makes it a limited 
study at best. It also places the authors 
within a fairly conservative, authorial-
intention school of criticism, one which 
is at odds with much feminist thought, 
particularly that which 
has been 
influenced by deconstructionist theory. 

In direct opposition to the post-
structuralist notion that a text is an 
ever-shifting entity with many possible 
readings, Gilbert and Gubar read 
every book as the concrete result of the 
author's intention- an intention they 
interpret as confidently as if they had 
just talked with the writer over lunch. 

Thus we find references to Kate 
Chopin's dealing with her "anxieties 
about [literary J repression by enacting 
them in this text," to Willa Cather's 
"clearly feeling ambivalent" about her 
protagonist, and to the science fiction 
author C.L. Moore's depicting a 
freakish female alien because of her 
own "culturally conditioned self-
loathing." 

The problem is not simply that these 
judgments often 
seem extremely 
presumptuous and irrelevant. The 
main error is that by placing all of their 
discussion squarely on the shoulders of 
the author's apparent meaning, Gilbert 
and Gubar give no authority whatso-
ever to the reader. This is a fatal 
mistake. Feminist criticism need not 
focus on labelling texts either feminist 
or not-feminist. Rather, it should 
examine the play of gender-specific 
elements that, because of the instabili-
ty of the socially constructed opposi-
tion between female and male, con· 
tradict and undermine textual struc-
ture. Because of these contradictions, a 
text by the most extreme sexist on the 
planet can be given a valuable feminist 
reading- not, that is, a reading that 
claims the author was trying to make a 
feminist statement, but one that shows 
the patriarchal structures underlying 
the text to be capable of deconstructing 
their own foundations. 

When one considers these pos-
sibilities, many of Gilbert and Gubar's 
own readings, based as they are on 
assumed authorial intentions, seem flat 
and 
cautious. 
The 
authors 
acknowledge only tentatively that a 
woman writer might have derived 
textual power from such post-modern· 
ist concepts as a decentralized self or 
writing that is "deliberately imprudent 
or impudent." This perspective is sur-
prising since the tools of subversion 
that Mary Ellmann outlined in her 
landmark feminist text Thinking About 
Womm included irony, rashness, and 
deliberate writing from a position of 
marginality. Gilbert and Gubar take 
only small steps toward affirming the 
power of these strongly feminine 
modes of language. Although they 
discuss the strengths of paradox and 
fantasy, they view such techniques as 
escapist- proving women were so 
oppressed by reality that they had to 
turn away from it- instead of positive, 
transformative forces. 

While Gilbert and Gubar appear to 
celebrate the magical and the 
speculative, they do not realize half of 
the possibilities that fantasy generates. 
This oversight is never proven more 
strongly than by their assertion that the 
novel "inexorably" leads in one 
direction. Their doggedly linear 
conception of fiction is at odds with the 
structures of much avant-garde and 
fantasy literature. And again, what of 
the reader, who must inexorably follow 
a novel toward its single meaning? 

It is not that Gilbert and Gubar are 
unaware of the theories of post· 
structuralism. In true kitchen-sink 
fashion, they pay lip service to the 
French femin ist thinkers Julia 
Kristeva, Helene Cixous, and Luce 
Irigaray in the book's final chapter, 
provocatively titled "Sexual Linguistics." 
These writers, however, are brought 
up only to be dismissed out of hand as 
"mystical" and "straining." Gilbert and 
Gubar go on to praise Virginia Woolf 
as a bulwark of "practical" criticism. 

In fact, the last chapter may be the 
most frustrating of the entire book, 
simply because it seems so promising. 
The authors begin by setting their 
famous question, "Is the pen 
a 
metaphorical penis?" in opposition to 
"Is the womb a metaphorical mouth?" 


This dichotomy-that of the "father 
speech" 
vs. 
the 
"mother 
tongue"- raises fascinating questions 
about the origins of male linguistic 
hegemony in relation to the mother's 
role 
in transmitting language. 

Strangely, though, Gilbert and Gubar 
themselves remain on the sidelines 
throughout this discussion, throwing 
forth many provocative ideas from 
radical feminist thinkers, but rarely 
commenting on them. The chapter 
concludes with a pat comment on the 
possibilities for female writers today, 
and the reader is left scratching her 
head. What was the point? 

Gilbert and Gubar do not present 
material in this book that justifies their 
current position as the grandes dames 
of American feminist criticism. They 
have a tendency, here as in MadworTUJn, 
to toss together genres and make huge 
generalizations about periods in an 
effort to be as encyclopedic as possible. 
As a result, their treatment of areas 
such as lesbian and black literature is 
thin and unsatisfying. The very 
concept of No Man's Land as a three-
part feminist extravaganza presents a 
problem. Far too many people are 
likely to take whatever Gilbert and 
Gubar write as the feminist gospel of 
the day. 

Of course, one can always hope that the 
next two volumes- to be titled Sex-
cluJnges and Letters From the Front- will 
rectify some of the wrongs of The War 
of the Words. This seems unlikely, 
however, since the earlier Madwoman 
shared many of_ this book's problems. 

In the end. Gilbert and Gubar are 
more historians than literary critics. 
They are valuable writers, for they un-
cover lines traceable through history 
that are crucial to feminist criticism. 
But in concentrating on the symbolism 
of the pen, they neglect what happens 
once the ink dries on the page- and a 
new world, a new battle, and fantasies 
that the author never imagined sud-
denly begin.
