Twenty years after Yale College went 
co-ed, the Yale College Programs of 
Study (YCPS), popularly known as the 
"Blue Book," 
has 
followed 
suit. 
Beginning with its 1988-89 edition, the 
YCPS will no longer use the generic 
"he" to refer to students. This change 
developed from a letter that inspired 
three professors of the Women's 
Studies department to sift through 
every sentence of the Blue Book for 
words and expressions they considered 
sexist. 

The letter arrived on the desk of 
Yale President Benno Schmidt in the 
spring of 198 7. It was the expression of 
a parent's displeasure with the Univer-
sity's public stance towards women. 
According to Margaret Homans, 
chairperson of the Women's Studies 
department, the parent's complaints 
included an objection to the frequent 
use of gender-specific language in 
official 
documents. 
Nancy Cott, 
department at that time, received a 
copy of the letter. After speaking with 
Yale College Dean Sidney Altman and 
YCPS Editor Lila Friedman, Cott met 
with Homans and Mahzarin Banaji, 
assistant professor of Women's Studies. 

Working on their own time, the 
three women compiled 
list of 
suggested revisions to remove gender-
specific expressions from the YCPS. 
Their recommendations included re-
placing •the student ... he" with -rhe 
students ... they: substituting -rhe" 
for "his," and rewriting some sentences 
entirely to eliminate gender-marked 
constructions. They suggested more 
than 40 revisions for the YCPS and 
often included more than one possible 
rewrite for each sentence they wanted 
to change. They also recommended 
that the term "chairman" be replaced 
by "chair," "freshman" by "first-years" 
or "first-year students," and "upper-
classmen" by "sophomores, iuniors, 
and seniors." "We hoped that this 
would become policy for all public 
documents at Yale," Homans said. 

While Friedman understands the 
professors' concerns, she has taken a 
more conservative approach to 
changes in the Blue Book. "The generic 
'he' doesn't bother me as much as it 
docs Nancy Cott and Margaret Ho-
. mans," Friedman said. Nevertheless, 
she believes that "language 
is 
consensual" and popular usage should 
be respected. Reasoning that the Yale 
community has begun to perceive the 
construction as masculine, 
she 
approved the replacement of "he." 

Still, Friedman was unwilling to 
accept the other revisions proposed by 
the three professors. She considers the 
term .. freshman• to be fairly en-
trenched in the language at Yale and
