procedural disputes do not 
qualify for retrial. Whether or not the 
decisions in the divestment cases were 
political, the five who were suspended 
in the fall of 1986 received the penalty 
prescribed by the Undergraduate 
Regulations. 

Still, many students feel the Execu-
tive Committee needs to discipline 
itself. Carew, who became chairman 
last fall , has tried to make his 
committee more precise than previous 
boards. "One thing I feel very strongly 
about is that the procedures should be 
followed to the letter," Carew said. 
And the ad hoc group has set the 
Executive Commitee in that direction. 
"People are not aware 
of how seriously 
plagiarism is taken 
and exactly what 
constitutes 
plagiarism." 

The major coup of the ad hoc board 
was the formation of the Committee of 
Review, not quite an appellate body, 
but close. If a student has a complamt 
about an Executive Committee's de-

the case to send a written statement to 
the Committee of Review. This 
committee will not actually retry a 
case, but will advise the Executive 
Committee if it should hold another 
hearing. "We didn't want to undercut 
the Executive Committee in any way," 
Brooks said. "We see the Committee of 
Review as an opportunity for a 
reflective, second thought- a group of 
wise people who would be removed 
from 
the 
weekly 
routine of the 
decision-making." 

Some had more radical changes in

Protests ago. In 1969, an incident at 
Wright Hall sparked the first wave of 
chanÂ·ges 
in 
Executive Committee 
policy. StUdents barricaded the office 
of a personnel administrator to protest
