EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Just a couple of words, that's all. It was the next to the last night of 
production weekend, and the only major task left for the editors was to 
come up with titles. We sat down to plow through the stories in order: 
first, the Newsjournals. They're short piec~s; the titles should come 
quickly, we figured. There was Kirk Semple's piece about a program 
in New Haven to distribute clean needles to intravenous drug 
abusers. Playing on needle imagery, we came up with "Needle Point." 
But that didn't quite cut it. Then we thought about alluding to the 
controversy surrounding the program. Someone suggested "Sticking 
It Out." That wasn't right either. 

We decided to move on to the features. We were encouraged when 
the title for the cover story on Yale's disciplinary body came to us 
quickly: "Trial and Error." But apparently someone snoozed at the 
computer before the copy went to the typesetter: The piece came back 
as "Trial and Terror," which seemed a bit biased. Next we tackled 
Peter Zusi's piece-a light-hearted discourse about the art of saying 
nothing. We considered leaving the headline blank, but some thought 
that too subtle. Then someone suggested â€¢ A Tale Told By An Idiot, 
Signifying Nothing." Peter wasn't amused. 

Eventually things fell into place, as they seem to every issue. The 
Nw Journal, an undergraduate magazine covering Yale and. New 
Haven, comes o~t six times a year. We distribute 11,000 copies free 
throughout campus. Our contents range from short news stories to in-
depth research articles and from opinion pieces to book reviews. We 
are student-run and completely funded by our advertisers. 

In the past six years, six of our features have won Yale nonfiction 
writing prizes. The New Republic ran a condensed version of a New 
]ounud cover story on Accuracy in Academia. CBS turned another 
cover story on a New Haven prostitute with AIDS into a segment for 
60 Minutes. The same story also won a Rolling Stone College journalism 
award for investigative reporting. This summer the writer of the story 
about Yale Aviation clubs was asked to write a book on the same sub-
ject. And for three years in a row, The New Journal has won top honors 
from the Columbia University Press Association. 

We would like to see your input in the magazine. The New Journal lS 
looking for photographers, designers, salespeople, and writers. We 
have planned an organizational meeting for Thursday, September 22 
at 9:00p.m. in the Silliman Common Room. We hope to see you 
there .
