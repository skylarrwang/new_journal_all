**Title: Yale's Executive Committee: A Strict but Kind Parent?**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The Executive Committee views itself 
as a strict but kind parent to Yale 
undergraduates. But many students 
lee Yale College's disciplinary board as 
too heavy-handed. They complain that 
in answer to their procedural 
questions, too often they are told "just 
because." Yale's children are talking 
back, and the committee is listening. 
In response to a few controversial 
cases, 
the 
13-member disciplinary 
body, which guards the Undergradu-
ate Regulations, is working toward a 
reamciliation. The outcome could 
affect not only students' life at Yale, 
but in some cases their post-college life 
as well. 
Stuart Weinzimer (PC '88) was a 
medical school admissions director's 
dream applicant before he ran up 
against the Committee. He took a 
Jamaica class spring semester of 1987 
with over one hundred other students. 
Throughout the course, the professor 
encouraged his students to work on the 
problem sets together. 
And all 
hell 
broke 
loose. 
Weinzimer and his classmates 
collaborated. When it came to 
the take-home final, many figured the 
Yale policy applied. They were 
wrong; in the professor's eyes, over 50 
percent of the class had cheated. The 
case caught the attention of the 
Executive Committee members, and 
they called 13 of the students before the 
board the following fall. Although the 
professor recognized that there were 
extenuating circumstances, the most 
he could do for the students was plead 
for leniency. 
"There was a vast number of people 
whose papers were suspect. How they 
arrived 
at 
13 
seems arbitrary," 
Weinzimer 
said. "The scapegoats 
were made. They were never con-
cerned with the fact that there was any 
ambiguity surrounding my particular 
case." Weinzimer was suspended for 
a semester, a light sentence by the 
Committee's standards. As a result, he 
didn't get into the medical schools he 
might have. And for some of the 13 
who were suspended, with less stellar 
records than Weinzimer, it meant a 
change of plans from medical school altogether. 
Weinzimer's 
case 
is 
atypical. 
Although the majority of the cases that 
go before the Committee concern 
plagiarism and cheating, most are 
more straightforward. Forty students 
went before the Committee last year, 
and of those, over half were charged 
with academic dishonesty. According 
to Thomas Carew, chairman of the 
Executive Committee and professor of 
psychology and biology, the Commit-
tee has a clear-cut policy for plagiarism 
and 
cheating. 
"The 
routine 
punishment is spelled out in the 
regulations. They shouldn't come and 
be shell-shocked if they plagiarized that 
it's a two-term suspension," Carew 
said. "Certainly you take into account 
whether the person's moral fiber has 
been attested to, but you try to go on 
the information that is in front of you." 
The Undergraduate Regulations ex-
plain the rules and the punishment for 
everything from vandalism to political 
protest. But few students read the 
rules. When the regulations come in 
the registration packet at the beginning 
of the year, most students' minds are 
still at the beach. Later in the fall, the 
Executive Committee publishes a brief 
summary of its decisions in the Weekly 
Bulletin. But again, few students see it. 
Most students know little about the 
Executive Committee and the rules its 
members enforce. But with the help of 
an ad hoc committee appointed in 
March, 1987 by Dean of Yale College 
Sidney Altman, the Executive Com-
mittee's low profile may be rising. The 
11 members of the ad hoc group 
addressing student complaints, 
compiled a report to update Commit-
tee procedures. Their suggestions were 
approved by faculty vote last May. As 
a result, the Executive Committee will 
adopt detailed, annual summaries of


the cases and provide reasoning for its 
decisions. The Committee will try to 
make these cautionary tales more 
accessible to students, either through a 
campus mailing or the Yale Daily News. 
Liz Magill (BR '88), one of two student 
members of the ad hoc committee, 
thinks that if students know about the 
Committee, they might keep out of 
trouble. "People are not aware of how 
seriously plagiarism 
taken and 
exactly what constitutes plagiarism. I 
think (the summaries] can help with 
that and can make such cases talked 
about. And then when they receive it, 
they might say, 'That could be me, I'd 
better watch it,'" Magill said. Yet, she 
believes that if students are going to 
trust in the rules, the Committee must 
act consistently. 
Phebe Bell (MC '88) is sitting on 
Beinecke Plaza, the site of an anti-
apartheid rally attended by 1,000 
people two-and-a-half years ago. At 
height of Yale's divestment 
movement in the spring of 1986, 
several students came before the 
Executive Committee for building 
shanties, or, according to 
regulations, trespassing. Even though 
the Undergraduate Regulations call 
for suspension, the students were only 
reprimanded. The following fall, when 
Bell received a similar charge for 
blocking the Bursar's Office in protest 
of the University's holdings in South 
Africa, she expected the same penalty. 
But when Bell went in front of the 
Committee, its tune had changed. 
Bell, along with four others who had 
been reprimanded for their activities, 
was suspended for the rest of the 
semester. 
The board's membership had 
changed over the summer. The 
Executive Committee is made up of 
three students, a representative of the 
Dean's Office, three tenured and three 
untenured faculty members, and the 
three members of the coordinating 
group. The coordinating group-the 
secretary, the fact-finder, and the 
chairperson- run the Committee. Its 
members do not vote except to break a 
tie, but they do most of the work. They 
review infractions on Yale's premises 
that are called to their attention by 
police reports, 
faculty 
members, 
college deans, or the sexual harassment 
grievance board. At the end of each 
year, some stay on the Committee, but 
several new members are also ap-
pointed. In Bell's case, the presence of 
so many new members that fall broke 
up the consistency of the Committee's 
decisions. According to Richard Lapin 
(DC '88), a student member of the 
Executive Committee for two years, 
"They were two very different 
committees and two very different 
chairpeople." 
The ad hoc committee suggested 
that the members remain on the 
Committee for three years to ensure 
continuity. The Executive Committee 
will 
also make its records more 
accessible to members by putting case 
histories on computer. Cross-listing 
the cases by penalty, nature, person, 
and date will allow them to research 
past decisions that apply to current 
sessions. 
Jon Ritter (TC '88), one of the five 
suspended in the second divestment 
case, doesn't think a computer would 
have changed the outcome of his 
hearing. He thinks there is a human 
flaw in the system and that the 
Committee decided the case based on 
his politics. Ritter feels that Dean 
Altman selected a new board that was 
biased against his political activism. 
"We don't have any hard evidence that 
he appointed a committee that would 
be less sympathetic with us, but he 
certainly appointed a committee that 
was going to take a more legalistic 
approach," Ritter said. Altman 
appoints all the board members, taking 
suggestions for the student representa-
tives from the Yale College Council. 
Ritter feels that this arrangement gives 
Altman too much power over the 
Committee. But according to Peter 
Brooks, chairman of the ad hoc com-
mittee and professor of French, "The 
Dean is in the best position to produce 
a balanced committee. He is also in the 
best position to persuade people to join 
it." 
Dean Altman also has an ex officio 
post on the Executive Committee, as 
he does on many Yale College 
committees. Usually a representative 
from his office sits in. But Altman has 
attended one Executive Committee 
session, the second divestment case, 
raising a further question of his conflict 
of interest. "There is no doubt that he 
had influence on everyone in that 
room-
like if you're an untenured 
faculty looking to get in right with the 
administration," Bell said. No matter 
what effect, if any, Altman had on the 
Committee's decision, his presence 
looked bad for 
the board. The 
procedures state that either a 
representative of the Dean's Office or 
the Dean may be present at the 
session. In this case, both were there. 
The five 
defendants wanted to 
appeal based on Dean Altman's visit 
and the board's inconsistency, but 
there is no process for appealing an Ex-
ecutive Committee decision. "There is 
no one to complain to. You're supposed to 
complain to Altman, but we were 
complaining about Altman," Bell said. 
Only if there is substantial new 
evidence will the Committee rehear the
