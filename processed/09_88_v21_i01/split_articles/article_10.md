What To Do About Nothing 
Every once in a while I have nothing to 
say. This does not bother me much. 

Often, however, people expect more 
from me. At an institution that exists 
solely for the productive exchange of 
ideas-I refer here to Yale-it is a 
breach of etiquette to have nothing to 
say. It brings conversations to an end 
and indicates, well, stupidity, which 
can be awkward and embarrassing. 

And since students in particular are 
often confronted with occasions when 
they have nothing to say but are forced 
to say it, I present here some tips on 
how to say nothing, and say it at 
length. 

Circumlocute, circumlocute, cir-
cumlocute! Circumlocution is the act 
of talking around your subject, but it 
works just as well when you have no 
subject. This is what experts refer to as 
the doughnut of langu4gt: a fat ring of 
words with nothing in the middle. Cir-
cumlocution creates substance from 
nothing; 
what's more, 
it's poetic. 

Ancient writers used it all the time. 
One can enhance circumlocution 
through the use of litotes, or double 
negatives ("Don't not 
call 
me 
Ishmael"), repetition (to emphasize an 
important point), and substitution 
(why say "antepenultimate" when you 
can say "second from the next to 
last•?). 

Put things in a pattern. As does 
circumlocution, 
patterns create a 
struc:ture that makes something of your 
noth!ng. For example, if I 
have 
nothmg to say, I can change that into 
"The Seven Ages of Having Nothing to 
Say." Basing your pattern on 
S~espeare is g~, because it's 
poetiC. And now, mstead of having 
nothing to say, I. have at least seven 
paragraphs. An outline for the seven 
ages m1ght go as follows. First: When I 
was very young, I couldn't talk- thus I 
had nothing to say. Second: Once my 
mother told me to clean up my room, 
and I had nothing to say. Third: A 
professor asked me about magnetic 
fields or something and, truly, I had 
nothing to say. And so on. Different 
patterns work for different amounts of 
nothing. A doctoral thesis might be 
entitled "The Thousand and One 
Nights of Nothing to Say." 

Copy different styles. This gives you 
an excuse to say nothing because you 
are saying it in an unusual way. Legal 
talk is an obvious choice here, as it was 


Three figures sat in front of a large, old 
house, forming visors with their hands to 
shield their eyes from the afternoon sun, while 
dark shadows grew across the lawn (and 
with them grew the history of the house, a 
house that was ancient and, at the same time, 
somehow quite modern). There was nothing 
to do. Then one of the figures spoke up with a 
suddeness that positively made the teacups 
rattle in their saucers. 
•Ah, Cousin Pointsharp! I do so admire 
your independent spirit!" The cousin ad-
dressed, a most modern young woman from 
America, turned her head slightly, and then 
assured her interlocutor that he was odious. 
The third figure then spoke, an older woman, 
the bnghtness of whose gaze was matched on-
ly by that of the sun, which beat down upon 
the heads of the three figures. 
"Please, positively! This whole situa-
tion is . tellement ennuyeux! Ralph, 
what do you have to say for yourself?" 
"'Ah!" was the reply. 

This could go on for pages. The point 
of the scene is that "There was nothing 
to do." But because the style is that of a 
leisure-oriented, francophilic tea-
drinker, the passage is rather long. 
T he style itself accounts for 148 of the 
161 words that appear. 

O ne last point. Whichever method 
you choose to say your nothing, be 
sure to strike a bitter tone. You will 
sound smart, and people will take you 
more seriously. 

T hese devices are good for all 
situation s where having nothing to say 
might be rude or compromising. They 
are perfect for occasions where you 
m ust say more than you mean. They 
are a basic tool for today's student. 

There is, however, another process 
related to saying nothing, one which 
takes up less time and involves fewer 
rhetorical flourishes: That is, don't say 
anything. The difference is that when 
not saying anything, hands remain 
folded on the lap, eyes stare straight 
ahead (or perhaps pensively at the 
ceiling), and the mouth remains firmly 
shut. No words come out. When you 
don't say anything, nobody hears you 
say it- which is the complete opposite 
of saying nothing. Although'not saying 
anything requires fewer skills, many 
people consider it the more difficult 
p rocess. If it is difficult, that is because 
it requires honesty: You must admit 
you have nothing to say. 

H aving nothing to say should not 
imply having nothing on your m ind, 
but unfortunately this is often taken to 
be the case. Because of the structures 
of university study, people learn to put 
a lot of emphasis on the quick retort, 
the conclusive evidence, and the final 
analysis. All these things are loud, so 
loudness becomes the sign of the 
thinking process. But thinking is silent. 
It should not be embarrassing to let 
people see you thinking instead of having 
thought. 

Thus every 
now 
and 
then, 
everybody ought to shut up. This is an 
important point, so I'll repeat it: Shut 
up. If you do it correctly, it can 
actually be quite impressive. Picture 
the following scene: You sit with your 
legs crossed, wearing bright socks, 
holding a pad of paper (but no pen). 
You are silent. A crowd of people 
forms around you, waiting to hear 
what you have to say, but finally 
becoming impatient, they ask, "What 
is the secret?" "Oh, it's nothing," you 
reply; and they all agree that it is.
