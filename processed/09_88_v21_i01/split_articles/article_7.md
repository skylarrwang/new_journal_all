Darius Helm (MC '88) goes to the 
ltreets to distnbute clean needles to 
heroin Wlen. 
cut laws, he has been distributing clean 
hypodermic 
needles among New 
Haven's IV drug-abusing population. 
Parker is 
addressing 
a 
serious 
problem. Sixty-nine percent of the 175 
reported AIDS cases in New Haven 
are IV drug abusers. Few addicts have 
access to health information; even 
fewer use sterilizing agents or clean 
equipment. 

Three years ago, Parker founded a 
drug educational campaign in New 
Haven and Boston, now known as the 
National AIDS Brigade. He postered 
target areas in both cities with leaflets 
showing injection equipment and the 
warnings "DON'T SHARE" and "USE 
BLEACH" in Spanish and English. 
Several Yale medical students joined 
Parker on his weekly postering runs to 
the Dixwell, Grand Avenue, and Hill 
neighborhoods in New Haven. 

Parker has now taken his campaign 
one step further. He distributes clean 
needles and bleach in New Haven, 
violating a state law that prohibits the 
~ssion and 
trade of syringes 
wathout a prescription. Connecticut 
shares this law with only 13 other 
states. Using money he earns as a 
fisherman and pan-time teacher in 
South Boston, Parker buys the needles 
legally in Vermont for 18 cents each. 
Darius Helm (MC '88), a local 
AIDS counselor who helps Parker with 
the_ New Haven program, describes 
thear rounds. "We begin postering to 
attract attention and look for long 
~es (hiding track marks)," Helm 
said. â€¢If there's someone standing 
around who looks interested, we ask if 
he knows somebody who shoots drugs, 
ask him if he gets off." Once they locate 
u~en. they explain correct AIDS-
prevention techniques, 
including 
needle sterilization. 

Parker hands out 4-0 needles on his 
biweekly runs, making contact with a 
small fraction of the estimated 7,500 
IV drug abusers in the city. But he 
hopes to mobilize more volunteers and 
financial support and to dispense 4-00 
needles a month by the end of the year. 
Using the example of several inter-
national campaigns, Parker also plans 
to develop his program into a strict 
needle-for-needle exchange. 

He has met some resistance to his 
project. Some opponents of needle 
distri.bution and exhange argue that 
such programs only encourage drug 
use and drug trafficking. "I'm not sure 
that addicts are really sitting and 
worrying about AIDS, as opposed to 
getting through the day and getting 
more drugs," said Robin Kroogman, 
chairwoman of the New Haven Board 
of Aldermen's Special Committee on 
Drugs. 

Alvin Novick, M.D., professor of 
biology at Yale and chairman of the 
Mayor's Task Force on AIDS, admits 
that needle distribution could increase 
drug use, but supports Parker's cam-
paign for its short-term health benefits. 
H e believes that until enough public 
health care programs are established 
for the addict population, public health 
officials must encourage addicts to use 
their drugs safely. 

Novick also argues that the existing 
legislation intended to reduce the 
spread of drugs has done little to 
prevent drug abuse. In addition, he 
says, it has increased the spread of 
AIDS. He claims that laws restricting 
needle purchase have raised the price 
of injection equipment on the street, 
where needles cost from five to ten 
dollars. The high price of syringes has 
promoted needle sharing, which expedites 
the spread of the AIDS virus. "Addicts 
hate to share needles: Parker said. 
"They're only doing it out of necessity." 

U ndaunted by his arrest in Boston 
last month, Parker is continuing his 
efforts 
to create a 
Maine-to-New 
Jersey needle-distribution campaign. 
Recent proposals for legal needle-
exchange programs in New Haven, 
Boston, and New York City are en-
couraging, but too slow for Parker's 
agenda. To complement the expand-
ing New Haven project, he is initiating 
his own distribution program in New 
York this fall.
