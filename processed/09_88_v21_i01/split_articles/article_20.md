aspects of the organization while 
making a fresh break from attitudes 
and tactics that have hindered growth 
in the past. 


On June 5, police arrested Yale 
alumnus Dr. Elwood Bracey (SM '58), 
physician from West Palm Beach, 
and charged him with setting 
to the shantytown. The makeshift

At a hastily convened vigil the 
of the blaze, over 100 students

remnants of the shanties to 
new strategies. In addition to

hers, many new voices took part 
dialogue. "Although the younger 
~'""''"'""' might not have felt included

when the shanties were built, 
they were deeply touched when the 
shanties were torched," Blair says. 
•Many who hadn't been involved with 
us before spoke of their outrage. The 
shanties meant something to them." 


Out of this and other CAA meetings 
grew a commitment to pursue two 
related goals. The Coalition would 
push to secure a harsh punishment for 
Bracey, while erecting a new structure 
to replace the shantytown. 


The day after the fire, the Connecti-
cut state's attorney reduced charges 
against Bracey from first-
to third-
degree arson. Two weeks 
later, 
Bracey's lawy~r, his college roommate, 
entered a plea of not guilty and applied 
for accelerated rehabilitation (AR), a 
probationary period that precludes any 
formal trial. Each of the victims named 
in the application- Yale University, 
CAA, and the New H aven police 
and fire departments- had the right to 
appear in court on July 14 to object to 
Bracey's request for AR. Only the 
Coalition exercised this right. 


About a 
dozen CAA members 
attended the hearing. Four of them, 
including a Yale law professor, argued 
for a full-blown trial. One of those who 
spoke in court, Nancy Fishman (DC 
'88), was disturbed by Yal~s failure to

make a ~im ilar argument. "I think it 
says an ugly thing about the 
University," she says. 


Fishman 
believes that Yale would have been less 
accommodating towards a 
non-
alumnus. But Yale Deputy General 
Counsel William Stemple contends 
that Yale's inaction conformed with the 
University's usual posture. "I don't 
recall a case where Yale appeared in 
court to level a formal objection 
against a request for AR," he says. 


In the end, Bracey was granted 
accelerated 
rehabilitation and the 
record of his arrest will be erased in 
two years, provided he complies with the 
terms of his probation within the next 18 
months. Under these terms, Bracey 
will pay S5,000 in damages both to 
CAA and to New H aven's arson 
squad, as well as an unspecified 
amount to Yale far cleaning the granite 
slabs scorched by the fire. H e must also 
perform 400 hours of community 
service. At the specific request of the 
Coalition's 
representatives, 
100 of 
those hours will involve hands-on 
construction for a community housing 
agency. 


Despite its disappointment in the 
Bracey case, the Coalition was able to 
turn the renewed vigor of New Haven 
anti-apartheid sentiment into tangible 
gains. 


Mobilizing support for 
construction of its anti-apartheid wall, 
CAA members unearthed old phone 
lists and dialed every number they 
could find. They also encouraged 
participation of city residents by 
passing out informational leaflets on 
the New Haven Green during a 
concert. 


"We got an incredible 
response," Fishman says. "Some were 
people we'd seen before, some not. 
Some were people we hadn't seen in 
years." All told, 
more than 150 
students, New H aven activists, union 
workers, and politicians. rallied to build 
the wall on Thursday, June 16. As part 
of a series of speeches, State House 
Speaker Irving Stolberg called for the 
University to divest from companies 
doing business in South Africa. 


The very act of speaking, even more 
than the words spoken, dramatized a 
further reason for the anger incited by 
the shantytown's burning. The two 
wooden shanties had often been the 
location of rallies in the past and had 
come to symbolize not only the 
Coalition's concern for the plight of 
black South Africans, but a commit-
ment to exercising free speech. In a 
statement issued the day of the blaze, 
Yale President Benno Schmidt addressed 
this first ammendment issue directly. 
"A university must be committed to 
freedom of expression as a first 
principle, and therefore ought to 
tolerate even bizarre and eccentric 
forms of expression , 
including 
symbolic speech," Schmidt said. 


While the University voiced its 
tolerance of the Coalition's free 
expression, the precise duration of that 
expression became a 
point of 
contention . University Secretary 
Sheila Wellington granted permission 
for construction of a memorial wall for 
the weekend only. The following Mon-
day, amid threats of copy-cat arson 
against 
the structure, Wellington 
offered the University's help in 
dismantling and storing the wall so 
that it could be "reconstructed at 
discrete times and places." At a noon 
rally that day attended by U.S. 
Representative Bruce Morrison, the 
Coalition rejected Yale's offer after a 
voice vote by the approximately 120 
demonstrators present. The wall re-
mained on the site of the shanties, and 
in July, Wellington gave her belated 
sanction for its continued presence. 


Since then, the Coalition has tried to 
use the 40-foot-long plywood wall to 
divert attention from Bracey back to 
South Africa. The group plastered the 
structure with anti-apartheid slogans, 
petitions, and art, as well as a color 
photograph of the shantytown in 
flames. They intended the wall to 
inform passers-by about the racial 
policies of the South African govern-
ment, while encouraging them to 
support divestment. "It was so much 
bigger than Bracey," Fishman says. 
"We focused on teaching people about 
racism in South Africa and here. Yale 
is like a Vatican City- it tries to build 
up its own walls." 


Although the wooden wall in Rein-
ecke Plaza represents an important 
victory for the Coalition, the future of

CAA seems to rest more on whether its 
members succeed in tearing down a 
number of walls that have. arisen 
within the anti-apartheid movement. 


In the two years since the high point of 
the Coalition's visibility- its civil 
disobedience demonstrations- inter-
nal disputes have often grown while 
membership dwindled. 


This decline in anti-apartheid 
activism at Yale reflects a larger 
national trend. Soon after the South 
African government instituted its press 
ban in 1986, divestment became a less 
popular issue across the United States. 
The lack of press coverage has made it 
increasingly difficult for CAA to 
attract people to the films, lectures, 
and rallies it sponsors. 


Still, those who have worked with 
CAA point to more immediate reasons 
why attendance at its rallies shrunk 
from 1,000 in 1986 to fewer than 100 
last spring. Most agree that some 
realignment, at least in patterns of 
thinking, will prove necessary if the 
Coalition is to increase its ranks this 
fall. "I see things picking up," Fishman 
says, "but we must change our atti-
tudes 
about 
success. 
We're 
most 
powerful on the level of education. Not 
everyone IS willing to stand up at a 
rally." 


Fishman believes that the Coalition's 
fervent 
escalation of divestment 
demonstrations in 1986 actually held 
the group back in some respects and 
scared off potential supporters. She 
now encourages low-profile activities 
such 
as letter-writing campaigns 
designed to promote awareness about 
South Africa. This summer, students 
in CAA wrote to every member of the 
Yale Corporation on the subject of 
divestment. Some Coalition repre-
sentatives even met with Corporation 
members one on one. 


In addition, Fishman stresses the 
importance of promoting ties with 
other 
a-ctivist organizations on 
campus, particularly with the Black 
Student Alliance at Yale (BSAY). In 
the last year-and-a-half, the member-
ship of CAA has become racially 
bleached. "As with any movement, 
people feel locked out, and it becomes 
a clique," she says. "I get frustrated by 
that. We don't want to be just a bunch 
of white kids sitting around talking." 


Rosanne Adderley (PC '89), 
a 
former BSA Y 
political education 
leader and a CAA member since 1985,

apartheid movement. 
agrees that ethnic homogeneity has 
bun the Coalition in the past. She 
believes that many of CAA's ailments 
could be cured by establishing a multi-
racial steering committee. Last year, 
BSA Y designated a representative to 
attend Coalition meetings, and 
Adderley hopes that other campus 
political groups will follow. "There is 
something very attractive about 
presenting the administration with the 
diversity and equality that they claim 
they believe in, but which their 
involvement in South African invest-
rnents suggests they don't," Adderley 
says. 


During the 1985-86 school year, 
such a steering committee lobbied the 
administration for divestment. By fall 
1986, however, the pace of divestment 
demonstrations had outrun the com-
rnittee's organizational abilities, and 
the committee collapsed. CAA later 
~grouped with a racial mix propor-
tiOnal to the composition of the 
University population, which made for 
a predominantly white membership. 
.At the same time, many blacks were 
alienated by the Coalition's decision to

art'est of some demonstrators. Accord-
