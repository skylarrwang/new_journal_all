Gone with the wind is Friday night's 
dilemma of deciding which of the six 
movies on campus to see. The choice 
will be easier this September as only 
Spectrum, Ezra Stiles, 
and Yale 
Medical School ftlm 
soc1et1es are 
operating. The thinning of the ranks 
follows a tougher liability rule for 
film societies, making student directors 
personally responsible for debt, which 
in once case totalled $9,000. 

This new policy was sparked by the 
financial collapse of Berkeley People's 
Film Society (BPFS) last year. When 
Stan Paik (BK '89) took over BPFS in 
September, 1987, he hoped to show 
good fllms and stay on budget. By 
December, he had accumulated a $5,000 
debt, plus be had inherited $4,000 in un-
paid bills from previous directors. Paik 
increased his advertising and expanded 
the schedule, but his low turnout did not 
cover these costs. The night he showed 
the British classic, The Snvant, two 
people came. 

Paik thought he had no reason to worry· 
The University had never enforced the 
rule that makes directors liable for 
their expenses. After a few more flops, 
he cut the number of showings, but it 
was too late. Angry distributors called 
him daily to demand payment. It didn't 
stop there. They also began to call Dean 
of Student Affairs Betty Trachtenberg. 

Faced with court orders, Paik flew to 
France and left the defunct film society 
behind. 

To prevent another such occur-
ence the Dean's Office began 
investigating all ·of the film societtes' 
finances. First, the University made 
partial payments on the outstanding 
debts of film societies registered as 
undergraduate organizations. Ezra 
Stiles and Yale Medical School have 
the only two independent film so-
cieties. Then, T r achtenberg warned 
student directors that the Dean's Office 
would enforce the existing liability 
rule: The University will pay student 
directors' debts if they default, but the 
students must then repay the Univer-
sity. 

According to Trachtenberg, the 
Dean's Office isn't looking so much to 
punish students, but simply wants to 
prevent debt. The University has 
stepped in and plans to monitor the 
film societies' budgets closely. If it is 
deemed necessary, the Dean's Office 
will halt a society even mid-semester , 
unless the directors either pay their 
debts or alter the film schedule to make 
more money. 

David Kirchner (BK '89), a director 
of the Yale Law School Film Society, 
worries that the plan doesn't allow for 
sufficient flexibility. He explains 
that film societies' finances are erratic. 
A society can incur a $500 debt in 
one weekend. "If monitoring is set 
up that closely, at what point do they 
hold a director liable? At how much 
debt?" 
Kirchner asked. 
His 
society and Yale Film Society are 
taking no chances. The two are 
merging, and they will severely cut 
their schedule, wh ich won't begin until 
the spring. 

Maybe more important to movie-
goers, the new policy does not allow for 
much artistic creativity in the movie 
selection. "In a year-and-a-half or two 
years, there will be far fewer good, 
small-audience ·mms," Kirchner said. 
Now that directors must worry about 
liability, financial considerations may 
overshadow artistic ones.
