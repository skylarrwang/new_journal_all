"Is the pen a metaphorical penis?"
asked Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan
Gubar in The Madwoman in the Attic,
their groundbreaking 1979 study of
19th-century women writers. Gilbert
and Gubar argued that in a culture
where writing was defined as a male
activity,
many female authors
identified themselves with the figure of
the ranting madwoman. The book
became a classic, and the authors have
finally penned a sequel, titled The War
of the Wordr,
which came out last
January. This new book is only part one
of what is to be a three-part series, called
No Man's Land, examining the place of
the woman writer in the 20th century.
The primary achievement of The
War of the Wordr is the proof it provides
that gender issues have been an
undeniable force in modem literature writ-
ten by men and women alike. Gilbert and
Gubar feel that the emerging women's
movement at the turn of the century
played a key role in bringing gender
issues into the open. Satires of the
period often mocked women writers,
while science fiction
authors
~ considered the dire prospect of female-
ruled empires.
Yet even these
misogynistic works clearly considered
"the woman question" worthy of
literary consideration.

As
has been pointed out by
numerous critics, however,
most
female authors of this period are not
included in the modern literary canon.
The early 20th century's spirited
dialogue between
the sexes
has
typically been read as a monologue,
with the male perspective seen as
universal. As a result, the sexual
anxieties of modern male heroes are
perceived as generalized "metaphors of
metaphysical angst."
Gilbert and Gubar argue that the
prevalence of such angst, typical of
modernist literature, was a direct
result of the women's movement. The
Victorian conception of the sexless
woman gave way in the 20th century to
a new image, influenced by Freud, of
wild, voracious female desire that
threatened
societal
norms.
Simultaneously, male characters began
to
appear weak
and impotent,
victimized by uncontrollable new
opponents such as the two world wars,
industrialization, and Darwin's
theories.
These forces are often
considered fundamental to
the
formation of modernism. Of equal
importance, Gilbert and Gubar claim,
was the emergence of women into the
public sphere.
These women included many
authors. Gertrude Stein, Elinor Wylie,
Edna St. Vincent Millay and others
were controversial public figures who
"flaunted their sexuality through well-
publicized lesbian
affairs or
heterosexual promiscuity." Indeed, the
private lives of these women often
attracted more attention than their
work. Reviews that did appear were
