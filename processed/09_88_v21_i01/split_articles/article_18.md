EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
The Baha'i faith, with its emphasis on world peace and unity, is gaining followers in the United States and worldwide.  Baha'is believe that humanity is at a crossroads, possessing the technology to either unite or destroy itself. They advocate for peace on both religious and political levels, but avoid partisan politics, choosing instead to work towards positive change through community involvement and education.  Their teachings emphasize the eradication of prejudice and the importance of education, with a particular focus on educating girls.  The faith emphasizes action over words, with adherents focusing on living their beliefs as an example to others rather than through missionary work. However, Baha'is in countries like Iran face persecution for their beliefs, highlighting the challenges they face in their pursuit of peace.
