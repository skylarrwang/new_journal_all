gram at Yale, is not Baha'i, but he 
frequents the firesides. Wellen finds 
the discussions comfortable for people 
who want to explore religion. "The 
Baha'i Faith attracts the type of person 
who rejects ritual- the type who finds 
something spiritually valuable in 
religion yet resists the dogmatic claims 
and over-ritualized aspects of 
conventional religion," Wellen said. 
The Baha'i religion draws no distinct 
line between religious and secular 
issues. It seeks to realize three basic 
goals: unity of religions, international 
peace, and world brotherhood. 

In search of a modern religion 
during the early 1970's, two under-
graduates formed the Baha'i Associ-
ation at Yale. They asked Firuz 
Kazemzadeh, professor of Russian 
history and a practicing Baha'i, to be 
their advisor. At that time, Kazem-
zadeh offered a seminar in Trumbull 
College on the Baha'i Faith in response 
to student request. 
The Baha'i 
Association at Yale has gained 
recognition from the University as an 
official campus organization but has 
had a quiet presence on campus. There 
were nine members last year. Yet 
recently, Howard Garey, professor 
emeritus of French and romance 
philology and the current advisor to 
the association, 
received a 
warm 
welcome from 
the Yale Religious 
Ministry. Garey sees this welcome as 
an important step towards the aim of 
cooperation among religions. The 
semi-monthly meetings of the asso-
ciation in the Dwight Hall Library 
center. on 
topics pertinent to 
the religion, such as Islam and its 
relationship to the Baha'i Faith. Like 
the community firesides, these campus 
meetings are informal and open to all 
who are interested. 

The Yale Baha'i club is part of a 
nationwide phenomenon. There are 
over 200 Baha'i campus organizations 
across the country, with anywhere 
from two to seventy members each. 
They reached a peak of over 300 
groups in the sixties, and after a 
decline in the late seventies, there has 
been a steady growth of campus clubs 
in the last two years. The University of 
Michigan, Princeton University, and 
the University of California at Los 
Angeles have the largest organizations. 
According to Kern Kuipers of the 
Baha'i National Youth Committee, 
"Clubs are encouraged to determine 
the needs of their respective campuses 
and organize projects in keeping with 
their goal of world unity." Such 
projects as "Images of Peace," held 
annually at Princeton, try to heighten 
student awareness of different global 
religions and encourage campus-wide 
cooperation. "We are not just 
interested 
in developing ourselves 
spiritually, but in helping others to 
appreciate their own religion as well," 
Kuipers said. 

East first met West in Chicago, 
when the Baha'i Faith was introduced 
to America at the "Parliament of 
Religions," a 
conference held in 
connection with the 1893 Chicago 
World's Fair. The religion came to the 
United States from Persia, where in 
18H, a young man named Siyyid Ali-
Muhammad announced himself to be 
the Bab, or gate, through which a 
messenger from God would come. The 
messenger, Baha'u1Jah, from whom 
the Baha'iFaith gets its name, appeared 
after the Bab was martyred by the 
Persian government. In 
1912, 
Baha'u'llah's son came to the United 
States to spread the relig ion 
throughout the country. During his 
tour, he laid the cornerstone for the 
only Baha'i temple in America, which 
is located in Willmette, Illinois. 

Today, as the youngest of the world's 
independent 
religions, 
its 
global 
membership has grown from 100,000 
at the turn of the century to over four-
and-a-half million today, with 110,000 
Baha'is in the United States. Next to 
Christianity, it is the most globally 
diffused world religion, 
found 
throughout Africa, Asia, and the 
Americas. 

The faith 
is able 
to 
cross 
geographical and political boundaries 
because it recognizes the validity of all 
world religions. A primary Baha'i goal, 
the unity of religions, is based on the 
idea of progressive revelation. They 
believe that God has sent different 
manifestations, such as Moses, Jesus, 
and Muhammad, to meet humankind's 
needs at particular times. "Just as a 
child matures through various 
developmental stages until he reaches 
adulthood, humankind pursues a path 
of evolution that leads him closer and 
closer towards the realization of the 
Kingdom of God on earth," Garey 
said. "Along the way, humankind's 
needs will vary, and so God sends 
messengers at various intervals to 
address the unique problems of the 
time." Baha'is believe that God's most 
recent messenger is Baha'u'llah, whose 
teachings are to remain relevant for the 
next 1,000 years. God will then send 
another manifestation with a message 
unique to that time period. "In what 
other religious system is it taught that 
religion is relative?" Garey asked. 

Although Baha'is recognize all 
prophets and religions, they believe 
that a general acceptance of the Baha'i 
principles will bring about inter-
national peace, their second major 
goal. Baha'is identify a "Most Great 
Peace" as the next stage in the 
evolution of the planet when all 
differences between nations will be 
reconciled. The gradual establishment 
of international peace will coincide 
with the emergence of the Baha'i world 
order, which Baha'is associate with the 
millenium- the arrival of the King-
dom of God on earth. "During this 
time, 
the 
Baha'i community will 
contribute more to the search for a new 
world order, as it will already be 
apiritually grounded in the idea of 
unity," Kazemzadeh said. But Baha'is 
realize that even in the Kingdom of 
God, there will be problems. "There 
will be troublemakers," Garey said. "It 
will be a system of government in 
which the inevitable conflicts will be 
dealt with in 
a 
reasonable but 
compassionate manner. There will be 
a large place for love." 

Meanwhile, Baha'is first anticipate 
tbe establishment of a "Lesser Peace" 
that will be negotiated by secular 
means. As Kazemzadeh explained, "It 
is not an apocalyptic view that on an 
established date all guns will cease
