indelicate they might be, however 
personal," Lapin said. 


Many 
students find 
the whole 
process overwhelming. The meeting 
place itself, on the fourth floor of 
Sheffield-Sterling-Str;athcona Hall 
(SSS), Jacks amenities that might make 
the students feel at home. The Torch 
Room once housed the Torch Society. 
The students and Committee members 
sit around a long table in high-backed 
chairs and address each other by 
formal titles. If students want to plead 
guilty, 
they may 
face 
only the 
coordinating group. But if there are 
extenuating circumstances or if they 
want to plead not guilty, students 
usually 
go 
in 
front 
of the 
full 
committee to advise students who go 
committee. Most of the cases go before 
before 
the Executive Committee. 


"There were no impartial people we 
could turn to for advice, and we were 
totally at their mercy. We could have 
faculty advisors, but they didn't know 
anything about it either," Ritter said. 


The procedures suggest using a college 
According to 
Weinzimer, 
"The procedures are sketchy and don't give 
you any idea of what's going on. I was 
never fully informed of my rights." 


Before any session, students receive 
a packet of information that includes 
the procedures, the charges against 
them, and any evidence that the fact-
finder 
gathers about the case. 


Even those advisors who have had 
practice play a minor role. They are 
meant not to be advocates of the 
students but to suggest questions or 
issues to raise. They may help the 
student prepare but may not partici-
pate directly in the proceedings until 
the end. "An hour later when the 
advisor gives a small statement, it 
doesn't make any difference. Yalies are 
not known for changing their minds. 
Your advisor not only has to be 
wholeheartedly for you, but he has to 
be aggressive," Dick said. The 
advisor's role was originally intended 
to be unobtrusive so as not to turn the 
session into a trial and the advisor into 
a defense lawyer. Among the ad hoc 
committee's major revisions, it has 
tried to redefine the advisor's role as a 
more active one. 


But Carew is wary of the Executive 
Committee's becoming too much like a 
court. "The Executive Committee is 
not a trial. It's a delicate balance, but 
it's not a trial," he said. "We try to solve 
things not in strict, legalistic terms with 
cross examinations and the like, but in 
as much of a familial and supportive 
environment as we can." If the 
Committee were only sending students 
to their rooms without dinner, maybe 
they would believe him. Some students 
see the Committee more as judge and 
jury and have decided to take Yale on 
with a lawyer. Students may use 
lawyers as their advisors when they are 
charged with offenses against people or 
property. If students bring an 
attorney, the Committee calls in the 
general counsel of Yale University. 


Carew strongly recommends against 
seeking outside counsel. "I think it 
would be awful for the students. It isn't 
just that Yale could muster the clout to 
outclass the lawyers that students could 
bring in, it would be what that would 
turn the proceedings into. It would be 
adversarial." 


Lapin admits that the students who 
go in front of the Committee feel 
intimidated. But he thinks that anxiety 
is inevitable. "You're not there to have 
a picnic. I don't think it's adversarial 
like in a courtroom, but certainly ten-
sions are charged," Lapin said Many 
students feel that the University does 
little to make them feel at ease. The 
circumstances, the setting, the pro-
cedures, all add up to an unfriendly 
situation. 


Bell felt 
more comfortable 
recognizing at least three of the faces 
on the Committee. "The students on 
the Committee make such a difference. 
Regardless of how they were going to 
vote, it was such a comfort to have a

face that I knew on the Â·other side of the 
table. And I could aim a lot more of 
my talk to a person I knew was no 
more scary than I was," Bell said. She 
feels that 
more students on the 
Committee 
would 
help ease the 
tension. Student members are not 
much different from the others; their 
role is not student advocate, but 
member of the Executive Committee. 
"The student is just another member 
like anybody else, truly they are. 
There is a great sense of consensus in 
the committee. We don't feel it's us 
against them," Lapin said. 


There are some aspects of going 
before the Executive Committee that 
will never be easy. No one likes to be 
scolded. "You feel so alienated. You 
are so angry at the University, and that 
shouldn't be," Bell said. But according 
to Carew, "As much good happens in 
that room for students, as stuff that 
makes them feel bad. It validates the 
very existence of the community, and 
it says thllt we have agreed as a 
community to live by a code of rules." 


Those rules have changed with the 
times, and the Executive Committee is 
trying to respond to new problems. 
But its own image may present the 
biggest challenge. "It is not just 
important that fair decisions are made, 
but that fair decisions are perceived to 
have been made," Carew said. Com-
mittee members are working to make 
the students trust in them and in the 
house rules. Yet for those students who 
must leave Yale's family, many never 
really feel part of it again. "It was like, 
'OK you're back.' I didn't get a letter or 
anything. I appeared at Yale's doorstep 
and started taking classes again," 
Weinzimer said. "For me, Yale is just 
this evil monster now. I have no 
attachments."
