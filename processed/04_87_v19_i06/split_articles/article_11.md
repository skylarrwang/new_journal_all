EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Noah's Ark theory of ballroom dancing; graduate and undergraduate students are encouraged to arrive singly. The dancers switch partners frequently and must introduce themselves before slipping into each others' arms. 

The club consists of a core group of about fifteen students. A comparable number of floaters attend less regularly. Most are beginners, although a few seem instinctively to know a rhumba from a cha-cha. Whether or not a ballroom dancing "sub-culture" exists, most of the members have joined the club "just to have fun and dance." Ellen Barber (SM '87) and Peter Olszowka (SM '87) explained, "We realized the senior prom was coming up, and we didn't know a thing." Others said that they attend the formal dances sponsored by the residential colleges every Christmas and spring and are tired of floundering on the dance floor. "I've wanted to learn for a long ti.me, but I couldn't get into the class at the gym," said Tom Huang (SY '89). 

The club's founders hope to sponsor a dance at the end of the semester. Meanwhile, its members are looking forward- rather confidently, in fact- to the spring dances and senior prom. But now, according to Leon Hwang (TD '87), "the problem will be finding someone else who knows how to do all this." 


**Title: Critical Shortage**
**Author: Pamela Weber**

A travel brochure for the Philippines might boast of warm weather and mangos. It would probably not mention nurses. But to tap this little-known resource, Yale-New Haven Hospital recruitment officers traveled halfway around the globe last December. The hospital staff had hoped to gain more than 20 employees, but only ten candidates had passed their nursing boards and had their visas approved. As a result, the hospital continues to face a serious problem: a conservative estimate places the size of Yale-New Haven's nursing staff at 900, 100 nurses shy of the ideal figure. According to Maureen Egan, Yale-New Haven's Personnel Manager, "There hasn't been a crisis like this in a long time." 

The difficulties at Yale-New Haven reflect a national problem: there are not enough nurses to meet mounting demand. As the Baby Boom generation grows up, improved technology is keeping them and their parents alive longer. As average age increases, the likelihood of sickness and injury grows. In addition, costly insurance polictes are forcing hospitals to reduce the length of in-hospital stays. Consequently, the outpatient industry has grown, requiring still more qualified nurses. 

Despite the demand, low enrollment plagues nursing schools across the country. High school students who are not college-bound tend to enter the work force immediately after graduation, without considering alternatives like nursing school. Working conditions such as bad hours and frequent weekend shifts discourage many prospective nurses. For some, nursing's frustrations outweigh its rewards. "If I could have another chance, I would never choose the profession," said Maureen Kangley, a Registered Nurse at Yale-New Haven Hospital since 1976. The current shortage makes the job more unpleasant. Kangley and other nurses find themselves compensating for missing staff. And the shortage is affecting care. 

Rachel Rotkovitch, vice-president of nursing for Yale-New Haven Hospital, admitted that "patients may sometimes have to wait a long time when they call for a nurse because nurses are so busy." 

Such difficulties have led Rotkovitch on a crusade to recruit nurses for Yale-New Haven. She has scheduled future missions like the Philippine trip to nursing recruitment fairs in England and Ireland this spring. In addition, recruitment officers are stepping up efforts at high schools across the country.
