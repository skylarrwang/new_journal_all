He compiled a record 
of everything Walpole 
did every day for a 
60-year period. 
eighteenth century dinner party, "I can 
find at least 30 prints with references to 
corkscrews in them." Using the system, 
she can look up visual data on anything 
else from curtains to chimney sweeps 
in the library's prints. 
In the print room she and Devine 
haul out a gigantic three by two foot 
volume of H ogarth prints. "It's an 
elephant folio," she laughs, "that's all I 
can say." Turning through the .prints 
she explains how the original H ogarth 
collector George Steevens lined them 
up in various states and editions to 
make comparison easier. She pauses at 
a page showing the infamous English 
murderess Sarah Malcolm in a dozen 
printed states of the same pose. After 
the prints she produces a true piece de 
resistance, an actual copper plate of 
Hogarth's famous satire "The Sleeping 
Congregation" 
used 
to 
press out 
copies. The bookseller's 1967· price still 
affixed 
the 
back 
momentarily 
distracts her. "Ninety pounds," she 
says with pride. Apparently, Mr. 
Lewis had 
not only a 
collector's 
enthusiasm, but an eye for a good 
bargain as well. 
While the print room and much of 
the Lewis Walpole exclusively reflects 
Walpole's character, the New Library 
gives both men expression. Paintings 
of Walpole and his relatives hang from 
the walls, while a framed photograph 
of Lewis meeting with his cousin John 
F. Kennedy sits on a low table. There 
are two eight-foot cast-iron lanterns 
from Strawberry Hill at the arched 
entryway, and shelves of eighteenth-
century literature next to twentieth-
century critical volumes. Walpole's 
prized objects, such as a lacquered 
wooden box accented with Wedgwood 
and lapis lazuli that he had built to 
hold a friend's drawings, stand beside 
Lewis' favorite leather chairs and 
desks. The 1 $ense of wholeness the 
books, furniture, objects and space 
produce could not be more strategic or 
more natural. 

If the Walpole visitor. tires after 
hours of gawking, walking or re-
searching, the staff prepares tea in the 
white, sunlit kitchen at 3:30. More 
often than not, the four wom_en take 



this tea alone. Tourists make up the 
majority of visitors, and almost all 
research questions are handled by 
phone or through the mail. The last 
patron using the library for long-term 
research left late in 1986. Though 
Devine has only been at Yale for a few 
months, she is already surprised at 
how few faculty members use it. 
"Jacqueline Kennedy, 
Mr. 
Lewis' 
niece by marriage, used to drop 
around," she says casuaJly. 
The 
allusion brings up the subject of 
friendly relations with the nearby Miss 
Porters school, where the First Lady 
once prepped. A senior English class 
from the school reading Walpole's The 
Castle of Otranto has been through on a 
tour recently. Otherwise, the cold 
months tend to be the slowest. 
Even without 
regular visitors, 
Devine contents herself with keeping 
the Wa.Jpole presentable to company. 
Fully absorbed in her surroundings, 
she sighs, "The beauty is just lovely." 
In fact, her words make sense applied 
to the Lewis Walpole, whose name-
sakes balance and complement one 
another. Everywhere Lewis and his 
staff have recreated the pleasures of the 
contemplative and epistolary life 
Horace Walpole 
led. 
The added 
dimension of Lefty Lewis' effects only 
doubles that sense. Both library and 
librarian are ready for as many visitors 
as time will permit. Lefty Lewis' own 
invitation to "come and have a Walpole 
wallow" still echoes in the halls.
