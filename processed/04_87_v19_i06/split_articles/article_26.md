Heroic Landscapes 
Adrienne Rich, Robert Haas, and John 
Hollander have won it. 
W. H. Auden, 
Stephen 
Vincent 
Benet, 
and Archibald 
MacLeish have judged it. And between 400 
and 900 men and women now compete for it 
every year. The Yale Series of Younger Poets, 
the country's oldest "first book" competition, 
offers a weighty heritage to its winner. 
Begun by Clarence Day, the brother of 
Yale University 
Press Director George 
Parmlee Day, the contest is now in its eighty-
econdyear. Anyone under the age of 40 who 
never had a poetry collection published 
!Y subTTJit a manuscript; and according to 
'harles Grench, acquisitions editor at the 
ress in charge of the competition, this 
rocedure generates «a real mixed bag" of 
tries. "A lot of them are terrible," he 
oncedes. 
But the winner's poetry, 
as 
onstrated by the impressive list of past 
ictors, is often superb. In addition to 
ublishing the winner's collection, .;· the Yale 
niversity Press arranges readings and press 
'!!leases heralding the arrival of the new talent 
'n the poetry world. Winning the Younger 
Poets Series can mean the difference between 
ccess and anonymity in literary circles. 
James Merrill, the current judge of the 
mpetition, selected Julie Agoos' collection 
bove the Land as this year's winner, and 
'n March the Yale University Press published 
goos' book. According to our reviewer, her 
ork could stand alone on its merits. Due to 
good graces of Merrill and the Yale Series 
if Younger Poets, it will no longer have to. 
ulie Agoos won the Yale Younger 
oet's Award last year, and in her 
ms she presents a heart so feeling 
d so full that I am tempted to 
onder at its reverence. One cannot 
ssibly, I have thought, find the 
dscapes of Cambridge and New 
ampshire, unalterably familiar to 
ose of us who have lived there, so 
triguing and ripe with possibility.

Above the Land 
: poems are very intelligent, but not 
l. conceptually challenging; they tend to 
l:' be impersonal, 
anecdotal, 
morally 
~ neutral, elegantly turned but without 
§ passion." J ulie Agoos avoids these 
~ particular faults, carefully negotiating 
~ the often brutally unforgiving dialectic 
~ between her own voice and the weight 
8 of tradition. 


But Julie Agoos' immediate project, as 
James Merrill says in his introduction 
to her book, is to challenge her own 
pronouncement that "So much 
sensation is unknown." Unknown, or 
pei'haps undiscovered; and her poems 
dare those insensate hometown places 
to yield up their secrets. She writes of 
painting over an old chipped railing: 
Whatever homage Agoos has paid to 
the Academy's standards of poetic 
work (her love for her teachers and 
respect for the authority implicit in 
structures of learning are everywhere 
apparent), she slips through those 
tightly 
drawn 
boundaries 
with 
a 
slightly irreverent wink, a sly gesture 
of recognition. Her poems draw on 
myths 
ancient 
the 
Iliad, 
refreshing them in a 
particularly 
feminine way, while at the same time 
creating new myths equally heroic in 
their own terms: myths of broken 
language, chipped paint, and worn 
lives. 

In one poem, 
professor 
unintentionally 
insults 
Chinese 
doctoral candidate by placing her essay 
on the floor beside him after he's read 
it; and we are suddenly made aware of 
how communication has been failing 
and finally failed: "her soft-footed fury 
at the unmeant dishonor, 
insult/limited and circumscibed by 
language/yet all with the still precision 
o£ a watchspring:/the incompleteness 
of it and the timing." In another poem 
she asks her sister, who has tried to 
teach her the Latin names for trees: 
"My arm is a plow, or a circling 
airplane./! am giving a 
grain to 
something soft and fraying." And yet 
there is nothing mechanical about this 
gesture, repeated again and again 
throughout her poems, that shapes old 
observed forms to her own rhythms, 
ingraining them with her own voice. 

Both 
figures, 
the plow 
and 
airplane, describe the kinds of truth 
she lends to her observations: in one 
sense she is the truthseeker, churning 
up the fertile ground, and in the other, 
she patiently keeps her distance, 
circling wide and free above larger 
patterns. 

J .D. McClatchy has recently written 
of his misgivings about an emergent 
style among younger poets: "Their 
"Whom were you reassuring with 
Latin names?/What love made you 
believe the earth was stirred/to take 
you in? ... I cannot blame them, nor 
the blushing Acer/who fades unmoved 
by your particular step./That bark is 
not your skin, and roots long sunk/in 
moss do not drink rain for you, or 
carry/your memory to be dug at like 
a scent." 


Yet while language breaks down, as 
it does again and again in these poems, 
Agoos sets herself the 
task o f 
communicating without 
it; 
medium she chooses is the geometric 
shapes and patterns which b ind objeCts 
people together. 
Her poems 
written in Italy in which she constantly 
shifts between English and Italian 
show us a woman learning from the 
crossed, geometric and fluid patterns 
embodied both in 
the artistic· 
conventions of Italian Renaissance 
painters and 
in the 
forms of 
relationships with other people. While 
some of us may need a d ictionary to 
read these poems, we can trust her to 
make sense of unknown words for us, 
as they fit metr ically into the sentence 
or as she glosses them elsewhere. The 
effort i~ well worth it since the pressing 
sense of fluidity between shapes, old 
forms and new, 
transcends the 
language she uses. Standing on the 
banks of the Arno, she sees the figure 
of a young "Geometrist" she knows and 
remembers 
how he once pronounced 
a simple theory to a crowd of us 
in the Blue Grotto at Fresole: 
non si puo mai frenare 
Ia volonta-one can never 
cpntain the will, or the shape, of a 
thing. 

Suddenly the separations, the images 
which have refused to cohere in this 
poem begin to make distinct patterns 
of their own, in which the poet is not 
the container but the contained: 

But for the one surviving, 
North exists only in 
a hard vertical, South: 
where the father fell .. 
They my eyes steady on mountains 
in both directions; I cannot 
think in any language 
what these sights mean for now, 
though I hear the river speaking 
to itself. 

These figures of Geometry u nderlying 
her images constitute the landscape of 
her poems, a landscape wh ich draws 
on very particular sources, Italian and 
American, but which, as the title of her 
book suggests, ultimately transcend s 
them. 

The men and women of her poems 
are her heroes, but like language, 
heroism does not adhere to the figures 
of its traditional types. The heroic 
spirit she admires lives not in young 
boisterous warriors, but in the · older 
men and women who teach her: a New 
England farmer, an Italian widow, a 
silent concierge who speaks to her in 
the soft movements of his broom. 

These figures, which she treats. with 
tenderness or irony, become part of 
her search to inscribe a new Geometry, 
which borrows on old rules without 
becoming bonded by 
them. The 
process of unbinding herself from 
received forms of art, (that of Masaccio 
and Ucello) and of creating new shapes 
is a complex challenge against which 
each of her poems struggles in different 
ways. In one of her central poems, 
"The Four Seasons," Agoos evokes an 
old "Weatherman" to embody the 
elemental transcience of the weather 
itself. He is actually a field laborer, as 
old and honest, in her view, as the field 
he works in; with his aching back and 
his time-worn countenance, he is like 
the old portinaio, and the host of other 
old men who appear as the heroes of 
her poems, 
solitary unspeaking 
Other. This old "weatherman" is in a 
sense radically diminished by the poet's 
sense that he is "like this idea/of a 
crossroads in a field," and yet in the 
terms of her poem, his transcience, his 
ability to pass like the weather above 
the ground, lends him the dignity of an 
artist's subjectivity: "have I sim ply 
imagined/that life is like th is process/of 
the weather, or the patient/trud ge of 
p a inter .. . ?" 

S h e 
seems 
amb ivalent about the status of external 
objects, including th e people 
who 
represent objects: like 
the ground 
itself, will its eternal presence prevail 
over the weather (or weatherman) 
which shapes it? 

She works out 
this 
complex 
question, a question which draws 
together all the various motifs in her 
poems, through a poetry which in its 
largest sense imitates the discipline of 
geometry itself with its infinite ways of 
describing 
relations 
be tween 
objects. In her poem "The Good 
Neighbor ," 
speaker 
addresses 
herself to an ivory figurine of a 
C hinese'Iaborer, in which she sees the 
resemblance to an old professor of 
hers. She reflects that "H e, with his 
bad heart,! gave ours a sort of principle 
of heart,/found humor in the awful 
softening/that came with each a ttack 
this old portinaio·_ 
(far more capable 
of movement than we are) 
comes setting the floor astir 
with something closer to 
grandeur 
than impatience: pulling 
the broom, 
bending backward like 
an angler, 
a square bit of tapestry 
drags into the room beneath it, 
just like a hooked fish 
half rising out of flystruck 
water: how at home he is, 
moving through the room 
back first, his flexed thighs 
and puffed out ribs, 
blue-covered, 
mirroring the sky . 


on it, in each/it made (loving some 
particular/of learning) on oversized 
h eroes 
bearing 
arms." 

The 
representation of this professor 
(interchangeable with these oversized 
heroes he loves so well) as a small 
figurine cuts his heroism down to a 
more manageable size; he emerges 
fully heroic: 

For you are a good neighbor to them, 
a monk 
full of retiring passions, yet not too 
full 
to take the world beyond and move 
it inward, 
filling your basket with a lexicon of 
deeds and nature. 

The journey you must be on 
seems full of sorrow. 

Agoos makes us· wary of lexicons, but 
this one seems different, since it is a 
lexicon both of deeds and of nature, 
settling in the dialectic between the 
world beyond and the inward world, 
and privileging neither. As a tourist in 
Florence, she writes: "Here is a 
view,lhere is a postcard/a pen, a 
bright new/stamp, a glance toward the 
window, a glance inward:-" A full 
relation between the two characterizes 
heroic spirit 
in 
her 
poetry. 

Weaving these relations 
b etween 
herself an d others, and among the 
others themselves, Agoos begins to 
make patterns out of the sensate world 
with her pervasive sense of the 
immed iacy of feeling. H overing above 
the land, the patterns she draws are as 
minute and internal, and as broad and 
far-ranging as 
she 
wishes; 
what binds her poetry together is her 
sen se 
of 
profound connection 
between the two: 

I think of that unclaimed sound of 
voices 
that circles above the land: one 
cannot 
enter the perspective without losing 
sight of it. 

One loves what one is reminded of 
loving.
