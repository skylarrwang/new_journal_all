Ryan's 
insensitive and 
unmoveable stance. 
Members of the women's gymnastics 
and volleyball teams perhaps have 
more to complain about than most 
athletic teams at Yale. Some members 
of the women's volleyball team, a 
successful 
club sport last year, 
recounted 
the difficulties they 
encountered in trying to gain varsity 
status for their team, a goal they finally 
achieved this year. They told tales of 
bureaucratic mix-ups 
and of an 
Athletic Director deaf to their: needs 
and concerns. Some team me.mbers 
believe Ryan did not accurately 
represent them to the faculty committee 
on athletics, which grants varsity 
status. One member of the team 
claimed Ryan once told her that 
volleyball, the second most popular 
women's sport in the country, was not 
a "real" sport, but one to be played at 
picnics. The team 
finally 
gained 
varsity status over the summer because 
of a growing emphasis on volleyball 
t~roughout the Ivy League. 
Women's gymnastics became a focus 
of controversy last season when its final 
meet of the '84-'85 year was cancelled 
due to a bureaucratic mix-up. The 
athletic adminstration felt that the 
space allotted for the meet on the gym's 
eighth floor should be reserved for 
varsity basketball practices. During the 
course of negotiations with the rival 
team's athletic department to relocate 
or reschedule the competition, the 
meet 
fell 
through 
entirely. 
The 
administration handled the decision to 
move the meet and all suosequent 
negotiations without the knowledge of 
the Yale gymnastics team or coach. 
basketball coaches had 
not 
planned a practice for that day, and the 
incident called into question 
the 
.department's priorities, which gave 
precedence to a men's team's practice 
over a women's team's competition. 
·Members of the women's gymnastics 
team again. questioned their treatment 
by the depar:tment when they returned 
to Yale this fall. After thirteen seasons 
as a varsity team with a winning 
percentage of .908, six · Ivy League 
titles and a 99-10 record, the team 
dropped from varsity level to Varsity 
II level, a status entailing less funding 
and attention from the department. 
That decision upset many athletes and 
coaches on both men's and women's 
teams and caused many athletes to 
question Ryan's priorities. For some, 
the gymnastics incidents serve as an 
example of his alleged insensitivity. 
Ryan said the team's demotion was 
based on a policy which dictates that 
the status of a Yale team reflects the 
common standards set among all Ivy 
League teams. If other Ivy League 
universities treat a given sport as a 
high priority, Yale will follow suit. 
Yale looks to Harvard and Princeton in 
particular for setting standards. 
Because Princeton dropped their 
gymnastics team over the summer, 
leaving only four teams in the Ivy 
League, the Faculty Committee on 
Athletics, 
with Ryan's support , 
decided that Yale's team did not merit 
full varsity status. 
Princeton reinstituted its team this 
fall after overwhelmmg student and 
alumni protest, 
but Yale's 
team 
remains Varsity II and its members 
fear that such a status will hamper 
recruitment and prevent the team from 
competing on a higher level. Yale 
gymnasts and their supporters argue 
that because of the team's success over 
the last ten years, they should not be 
restricted or measu red by Ivy League 
standards which they believe they far 
surpass. ~The Ivy League is Mickey 
Mouse. Why should we _be confined to 
inferior teams? Yale should be running 
its own show and not just lqok at the 
Ivy League," said one gyinnast. R yan 
said the demotion should not affect the 
team. But members feel unsupported 
by the Athletic Department, and their 
morale has dragged. "It makes you 
wonder why you're doing athletics in 
the first place. You wish you could 
have an honest relationship but you 
don't," said one team member about 
the Athletic Department. 
The issue of the gymnastics team in 
many ways exemplifies the problems 
that arise with many of the criticisms 
leveled at Ryan. On the one hand, 
Ryan supports almost all his decisions, 
whether favorable err unfavorable, with 
department policies- policies, such as 
the creation of Varsity II status, which 
he has a large hand in shaping. And he 
cnuctzes 
many of his 
OFponents 
for their vague, subjective and often 
unsubstantiated accusations. 
"I've sort of taken that approach 
right down the line," said R yan. "That 
is to say, I've wanted to establish an 
identification for thi~ department, and 


I wanted it to know its boundanes, to 
stay within those boundaries and yet 
be terribly successful. The way to give 
those boundaries shape was to make 
policies and say 'this is the way we are 
going to be."' 
Because of his consistent adherence 
to policy in making decisions, Ryan 
often appears out-of-touch 
with 
athletics on the student level and 
indifferent to individual concerns or 
needs, focusing instead on financial 
matters. "He has a complete lack of 
respect for the people he's in charge of. 
He lost sight that the department was 
here to serve the students and team 
athletes, and it got turned around to 
where you're here 
to serve the 
administration,"

Consequently, 
complaints 
against him tend to be futile in the face 
of "policy decisions," and are 
subjective, personal, and critical of 
Ryan's attitude 
and 
personality , 
critical of the way Ryan has treated 
students and coaches. 
Those who do have a bone to pick 
with Frank Ryan usually don't speak 
out, at least not to Ryan himself. They 
tend to find other, more sympathetic 
outlets for their frustrations, such as 
friends, peers, or other athletes; and 
many simply choose not to speak at all. 
None of the coaches or athletes 
interviewed 
would speak on the 
record, citing past cases of sharp 
criticism and reprisal from members of 
his administration. The Yale Women's 
Athletic Organization, 
a 
support 
group for women athletes, published a
