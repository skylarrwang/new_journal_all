audience members feel more comfortable with this art medium, Phelps hopes to begin a series of informal dance presentations with Barnett and Kopell, followed by question-and-answer sessions. For now, though, the choreographers rely on word-of-mouth to engage people's interest. 

Each of the women, however, criticizes Yale for not helping to provide an educated audience. Yale, New Haven's most far-ranging cultural center and most influential corporation, does not provide any significant support, financial or otherwise, to dance. "Yale just doesn't respect dance or cultivate it. Dance history is a great anthropological tool,'' Kopell says. 

According to Kopell, both Wesleyan University in Middletown and Trinity College in Hartford have several dance courses within their regular curriculum. These colleges also bring in outside performers. In contrast, Yale's only dance offerings consist of a modern composition college seminar, taught every fall by instructor Barbara Feldman, and informal, non-credit physical education classes at the gym. 

Feldman points out that Yale has inadequate space for dance, and therefore cannot invite outside companies to perform on-campus. 

New Haven also faces the typical small-city struggles in finding enough dancers and enough funds for classes and performances. Phelps often must act as businesswoman as well as dancer and choreographer. At the beginning of one class she sat by the door with a list of dancers, accosting them as they walked into the studio. She needed to collect money from at least 15 people to hire a new teacher. By the end of the class, not enough dancers had contributed to ensure that the teacher would take the job. In a world with no stable financial backing, salaries are paid up front. 

In addition, male dancers are in short supply. An average class of 20 people includes only two or three men; one of these may dance with a local company, which restricts him from working for other choreographers. "Dance in America is considered a feminine art form, and men may think that only women can get involved. If they don't receive some exposure to dance in college, it can be that much scarier to take a class," Barnett comments. Recognizing the difficulties faced by both men and women in the profession, Kopell adds, "I think everyone in the dance world is frustrated in some way. But if you want to do it badly enough, you do it where you are and work with what you have." 

Despite their frustrations, these women will continue to choreograph and dance. In a largely uninitiated community, exposing audiences to dance will also remain a high priority. Given the intensity with which Barnett, Kopell and Phelps work, they should succeed in revitalizing the New Haven modern dance scene. But even if they fail, if audiences reject poets on ladders and white ropes, it won't really matter. "I am obsessed with dance. I don't find anything else as satisfying," Kopell says. "I just can't wait to get into the studio."
