Afterthought/Barry Shain 
Yale's Failing Grade 
Reflecting on my experiences at Yale, I 
immediately 
recall 
the 
sense of 
expectation that consumed me six 
years ago when I first was notified that 
I had been accepted as a graduate 
student in Political Science. I was 
looking forward to finally attending a 
u niversity where rigorous intellect-
ualism was positively countenanced 
and did not need to be apologized for 
nor hidden. Although I had attended 
over ten universities and colleges in 
California, I nevertheless still felt like a 
provincial coming for the first time to 
the capital. Maybe it was because I had 
initially graduated with a degree in 
industrial arts education (teaching 
shop) and had spent the last ten years, 
on and off, working as an auto 
mechanic; I'm just not sure. Ironically, 
that I had worked with my hands, I 
would learn, was in part responsible 
for my having been accepted. I was to 
be the department's working class 
hero. 
However, the:.ir expectations 
concerning my political sympathies 
would prove as wrong as my hopes of 
finding a dynamic intellectual life at 
Yale. 

What is most prominent in my 
memories and in my continuing sense 
of Yale are these expectations of intel-
lectualism that I had brought with me. 
Pan of this package of expectations 
was that the graduate students would 
be truly exceptional intellectuals and 
that the undergraduates would be 
rather mediocre. After all, weren't the 
graduates secular clerics willing to 
sacrifice everything in their pursuit of 
wisdom and knowledge while the 
undergraduates were rich spoiled brats 
looking to "network"? Additionally. 
"knowing" as I did that the life of the 
mind would be treated with great 
respect and devotion

expected that undergraduate teaching

priorities. 

Even before classes had begun, I 
became aware that maybe my expec-
tations for a rich intellectual life at Yale 
were painfully skewed from the reality 
that would confront me during the 
next five years. I had just returned 
from a summer of travel, the last of my 
many 1960s-style peregrinations over 
the globe, a summer of, in fact, intense 
intellectual excitement in Paris and 
.Berlin, 
where being an admitted 
conservative among Marxist intellec-
tu~ls had actually aided me in striking

up 
conversations and 
friendships. 

Then, after having passed a week of 
evenings at the graduate student bar, 
the GPSCY, I began to suspect that there 
among the graduate students my being 
intellectually challenging would not be 
met with enrhusiasm but, instead, with 
"moral" outrage. 

It seemed 
that 
graduate students, contra my expec-
tations, were not committed to the life 
of the mind. Nevertheless. I hoped that 
the GPSCY crowd would prove to be 
anomalous. Unfortunately, they would 
prove very much to be part of the 
public orthodoxy that would make 
graduate student life at Yale intellectu-
ally suffocating.

But once classes started, I had 
doubts about my initial impressions 
and discounted my experience at the 
GPSCY as being the product of post-
travel fatigue. What fostered these 
doubts was the happy discovery that 
the Political Sciencefaculty, contrary to 
my expectations, were mtellectuaUy 
open and seemingly willing to take 
risks (a p rescient observation, 
as 
allowing me to teach would subse-
quently 
bear 
witness). 
What 
experienc~d. which may in 
part 
explain the inaccuracy of my expec-
tations, was that the faculty's overall 
confidence in the 
liberal pluralisr 
descriptive and normative model was 
in the process of collapsing. They (as is 
possibly the discipline as a whole) were 
once again 
becoming 
increasingly 
insecure about their paradigmatic 
nakedness, and were beginning to 
search for alternatives-
hence, the 
openness. Obviously, Yale was not 
intellectually moribund, or so I hoped 
anew. 

But the sense of relative openness 
that I found among the Political Science 
faculty did not apply, unfortunately, to 
the graduate students. My initial 
reactions formed in the summer were, 
if anything, 
too flattering. The 
graduate students, 
the life-giving 
center of intellectual experimentation 
on every campus I had known, seemed 
to be for the most part brain-dead and 
neutered, epigones of 1960s radical-
ism, religiously dogmatic souls that 
were, nevertheless, bereft of a vital 
religion. To say that they were closed-
minded and weren't engaged actively 
in the life of the mind would prove to 
be a gross understatement. I would 
learn during the course of the next five 
years that their normal response to 
intellectual challenges would be verbal 
castigation or physical abuse. 

Although my initial impressions of

As I

Yale's commitment to ·- quality 
education. After· years· and years of

judge the quality of. teaching far more 
effectively "than <:ould the ·average 
undergraquate . . And. _what disturbed 
me was, the reaii4:ation.that the College, 
in spite of the enormous aniou.nt of 
money undergraduates spend to attend 
Yale and the pre.stige that accrues, does 
not foster intellectualism, in that 
taking teaching· serious!y _ is not 
encouraged by Y.ale College. 

Although lip service is of course 
given to the importance of teaching, l 
was struck by how empty this promise 
is when I learned that teach\Qg assis-
tants were sometimes (frequently?) 
assigned to a particular class not 
~caus.eofexpertise, or even interest in 
a subject matter, but instea~ because 
of the administrative needs of 
departments who have made pledges of 
financial assistance to these students. 

Slowly, I was beginning to doubt the 
truism that Yale Up.iversity was 
structured to serve the needs of its 
undergraduates or, in the larger sense, 
the full life of the mind. 

Not only were the teaching assistants 
frequently not passionate seekers of 
knowledge, 
but seemingly, 
assistant professors also were not 
lightning rods around which hungry 
young souls could congregate in their 
quest for understanding. How could 
they afford to be while working in a 
research university where promotion is 
based almost solely on the quantity of 
one's publications (and the possession 
of certain social graces)? 

Given that most of the junior people 
know they will be cut loose in a few 
years, rationality demands that they 
waste as little time as possible on 
teaching. Here at Yale, as at other 
research universities, there are few 
professional returns for 
investing 
energy and love into teaching. I often 
wondered how many students and 
their parents really understood on 
what basis Yale's reputation rests (the 
scholarly output of its faculty) and 
that, in general, excellence in teaching 
is not encouraged nor to be expected. 

What I found even more remarkable, 
given my experience in the '60s when 
the quattty 
01 
teacnmg was 
paramount importance to students, 
was how quiescent Yale's students were 
in the face of their exploitation. 

In spite of my general disap-
pointment with the inteUectual life to 
be found at one of the great Ivy League 
universities, 
at least one of my 
expectations, nevertheless, would 
happily prove to be errant. Without 
denying the possibility that many, if 
· not most, of the undergraduates may 
actually be the rich brats I had 
expected, I can only report that in four 
years of teaching and leading sections 
here, I have never been aware of 
having had any in my classes. And 
even more striking to me was that it 
was among the undergraduates that I 
finally 
discovered 
a 
small but 
significant minority committed to the 
Jife of the mind. And even if being a 
minority 
is something that may 
frustrate these students themselves, 
they seemingly are treated respectfully 
by their peers, a condition that cer-
tainly doesn't obtain in most of the 
many universities that I have attended. 

Almost in spite of Yale College's lack of 
support, there is ro be found among 
some of its undergraduates a flourish-
ing intellectualism. 

I have been impressed with the way 
undergraduates have responded to roy 
courses ("Political Culture of the 
1960s,., "Colonial American Rel1gious 
and Political Thought," and "Con-
servative Critiques of Modernity") 
where they are exposed, probably for 
the first time, to one truly radical form 
of thought, in this case, philosophical 
conservatism. What has struck me. as 
so unusual is their inteJlectual maturity 
in the unsettling and alien intellectual 
environment my classes create. On the 
whole, they have reacted neither as-
docile conservative sycophants nor as 
blind liberal dogmatists but, rather, as 
careful and judicious explorers 
traveling in an unknown land. 

It has been in my classes that, 
finally, I (and I hope my students) 
found myself engaged in the intellec- . 
tually challenging milieu that I initially 
had hoped would describe all my 
experiences at Yale. My students h_ave 
continuously challenged me and forced 
me to defend, clarify, and even 
expunge parts of the argument l have 
put before them. For the experience 
they have afforded me, I owe my stu-
dents a great debt of gratitude that I 
can never repay. 

In addition to having been graced 
with the finest of students, I have been 
very fortunate in my years at Yale in 
enjoying truly warm and erudite 
advisors. Therefore, in spite of the 
philistinism of many of the graduate 
students that I have encountered, I 
must think of leaving Yale only with 
the greatest of trepidation. Where else 
will I be able to teach and learn from 
such splendid students and to argue 
with such noble adversaries as my 
advisors? Nevertheless, my overall 
judgment of Yale must rest finally on 
the shocking absence of an active 
intellectual life on campus and Yale 
College's concomitant lack of commit-
ment to undergraduate education. 

Possibly, in the quest for bourgeois 
civility and scholarly professionalism, 
intellectualism at Yale has been dis-
couraged. Regardless of who or what is 
responsible (and I don't claim to 
know), it ultimately is incumbent on 
the students and their parents to insist 
on their purchased right to an education, 
not simply an experience in trivial 
pursuits.
