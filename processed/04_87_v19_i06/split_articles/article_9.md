Sterling Voices
Wednesdays, right around noon, most 
people eat lunch. Hardly anyone goes 
to the library. So hardly anyone, 
except perhaps a few librarians, hears 
the voices coming faintly from a far-off 
corner of Sterling. A lonely grad 
student playing a radio in the stacks? 
Confused worshippers mistaking Ster-
ling for a church? Not quite. It's the 
Yale University Library Staff Singers. 
"We practice on Wednesdays," 
conductor David . Weisbrod explained. 
Weisbrod, 
who 
works 
for the 
Library Systems Office, has conducted 
the Staff Singers for several years. He 
did not come up with their name; none 
of the Singers seems to want that bit of 
ingenuity credited to them. But he has 
exercised an iron fist over the group, 
for whom fifteen minutes of calis-
thenics 
precede each We.dnesday 
rehearsal. Olga Phoenix, a veteran of 
the group and native Yugoslavian, 
remembers the turbulent days before 
Weisbrod's ascendancy. "Our first 
conductor, the one before David, was 
Ukrainian, so we sang a lot of Eastern 
European music. I, myself, loved these 
songs, but I think the words were too 
difficult for the Americans to pro-
nounce. We didn't have many people 
then. Now we have more." The 
members, composed of staffers and 
graduate student workers 
from 
throughout the Yale library system, 
sing mostly in English now, although 
last year Weisbrod let his troops 
perform "Mon coeur se recommande a 
vous." 

The Singers rarely schedule more 
than two tour stops each year. While 
students vacation in December, the 
Library Staff Holiday Party features 
the group as 
its entertainment 
attraction. And in late May, the 
Singers give their annual concert. 
These dates make it difficult for 
interested undergraduates to attend 
concerts, and Weisbrod admits the 
scheduling is deliberate. "We're not a 
student group, so we don't generally 
perform for students," he said. They 
do, however, make guest appearances 
at Tower One, a ho.using development 
for senior citizens, and at Connecticut 
Hospice in Branford. 

So why do they closet themselves 
away in the corner of Sterling, in the 
Lecture Gallery, to rehearse? Actually, 
the Singers do not always act so 
reticent. They have been known to 
sneak a song or two in "acoustic 
utopia"- the library nave. In this 
bastion of silence, doesn't Weisbrod 
think it inappropriate that he and other 
librarians set a noisy example? "No," 
he said, in a tone that brooked no 
argument.
