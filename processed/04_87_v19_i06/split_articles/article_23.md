EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
On a sunny Monday afternoon in 
March, only two days after Yale 
students dt•parted for their spring 
vacations, Frank Ryan quietly an-
nounced his resignation. There was no 
press conference, just a Simple news 
release stating that Ryan, director of 
Yale Athletics, would step down from 
the post he has held for the last ten 
years to a!1,ume new responsibilities at 
Yale 
in l' niversity planning and 
de,·clopment. Two weeks later. with 
Yale's campus in full s"·•mg again, the 
,,,.-ord of Ryan's resignation began to 
spread. leaving many students and 
athletes 
perplexed and curious, 
questioning the Circumstances of his 
resignation and ir' bearing on the 
Athletic Depanmcnr. 

For 
almost 
everyone v' ho ha ~ had a stake in the 
Athletic Department during his tenure 
-athletes, coaches,- alumni and stu· 
dents- Ryan's resignation 
meant 
something. 

For some 
a 
disap· 
pointment, for others a bl~ssing, the 
end of Ryan's career came as .a surprise 
to all who have follo~"'ed his admini-
stration. 

Stacked on a chair in Ryan's office 
are the framed pictures of his past. In 
one foune sits an aged cover of Sports 
Illustrated, with a vibrant, youthful 
portrait of Rxan during his days as 
quarterback for the Cleveland Browns. 
His appearance has not changed much 
since then. Now, at age 50, the grey· 
haired Rvan still boasts a robust 
figure. H~ has as strong and staid a 
presence as his exterior might suggest, 
speaking carefully, deliberately, with a 
slight Texas drawl. Ryan'~ years before 
coming to Yale tell the story of a man


with great capabilities and diverse 
strengths. As one member of the 
Faculty Commitee on 
Athletics 
pointed out, Ryan embodied the ideal 
example of the student athlete 
-capable on the field, accomplished in 
his academics. Ryan is perhaps best 
known for his career in professional 
football, having played quarterback 
four years for the Los Angeles Rams, 
seven years for the Cleveland Browns, 
and two years for the Washington 
Redskins. 

The press lauded R yan when he 
received his Ph.D. in mathematics from 
Rice University in 1965, six months 
after he carried the Browns to the 1964 
national championship. 

After 
his 
retirement from football in 1970, he 
became the director of information 
systems 
for 
the 
U.S. 
House of 
Representatives where he designed 
their electronic voting system. And 
then, in 1977, Ryan became Athletic 
Director at Yale. 

He will leave that position this July 
to take up a !lew University post, as 
Associate Vice President of In-
stitutional Planning, working under 
Provost William Nordhaus to develop 
Yale's resources and facilities. Since his 
resignation as Athletic Director many 
faculty members and students have 
questioned the circumstances sur-
rounding his promotion. 

Because 
Ryan's second five-year contract would 
expire in May, a routine review 
committee headed by former Dean 
H oward Lamar was appointed to 
evaluate Ryan and recommend whe-
ther or not Yale should renew his 
contract. R yan accepted the new post 
before the committee could make a 
recommendation. And because stu-
dents, coaches, and other athletic 
administrators have leveled criticism 
against R yan in recent years, some 
members of the Yale community 
speculate that his appointment might 
have been a way to shelter him from a 
strongly negative evaluation, main-
taining both his credibility and that of 
the Athletic Department. 

R yan openly concedes that the 
review influenced his deciscn to move 
on, but he stresses the importance of 
other factors, including a desire to 
become more directly involved in 
education. "The fact that I was going 
through a review caused me to think 
very seriously about a new direction," 
Ryan said. · "Before the review was 
completed I had reached the decision


that I didn't want another tenure as 
Athletic Director." 

Ryan said that he began thinking 
about a career change when former 
President A. Bartlett Giamatti stepped 
down last year. "I began contemplating 
the future, without anything specific in 
mind. I was coming to the end of 
another term at Yale, and there was 
the factor of a new administration who 
often like their own staff." He said he 
reached his decision 
to 
resign in 
December, after speaking with President 
Schmidt. "Benno also thought it was a 
good idea. He agreed that ten years is a 
long time as Athletic Director, but he 
also acknowledged that I had a lot of 
capabilities and was in favor of some 
other arrangement. I was delighted," 
Ryan said. Although his new position 
is far from the realm of athletics, in 
many ways his responsibilities will not 
differ from those that he held in the 
Athletic Department-he will still be 
dealing with finances. But his new job 
will not entail the kind of tasks he faced 
when arriving at Yale ten years ago. 

At the time of Ryan's appointment, 
three major problems plagued the 
Athletic Department. "The men's 
teams were terribly unsuccessful as a 
whole. The cost of running the Athletic 
Department was considered excessive 
by the administration. And women's 
sports was just beginning to evolve and 
they were groping for a direction," 
Ryan said. Aside from these problems, 
he also felt that the morale of the 
department was extremely low. "There 
was a lot of resignation that you can't 
win at Yale," he recalled. "Some 
coaches actually told me to my face 
that they thought they just couldn't win 
and that their job at Yale was just to 
maintain the program and give the 
kids good experience. I'm all for that 
too, but I think they should win their 
fair share. 

"There was a sense of not really 
knowing how to control their own 
destiny. It was a terrible state of 
affairs," Ryan said. He was hired to 
whip the department into shape- to 
improve its otherwise disastrous 
financial state; and to make the teams 
win games. To accomplish these goals, 
Ryan brought his skills of modern 
organizational management to the 
department, enacting 
series of 
"massive · budget reductions," !'lnd 
generally bringing Yale athletics under 
firmer financial control. Some criticize 
Ryan for increasing the Athletic 
Department's bureaucracy, saying that 
by expanding the number of associate 
athletic directors from three to six, he 
slowed decision-making and inhibited 
communication between his admin-
istration and athletes. But he 
eliminated t400,000 
in excess 
spending fro.u 
the department's 
budget and directed over $9 million in 
facility improvements, including the 
renovation of Coxe Cage. Ryan also 
made many personnel changes, in both 
the coaching staff and the admini-
stration, "to eradicate the impression 
that Yale can't win." The result: in 
1982 Yale athletic teams reached a . 500 
winning percentage for the first time in 
over 25 years. 

"I think those problems have been 
corrected," Ryan said. "Women's sports 
have gotten their direction. Men's 
teams are 'back on the winning ways, 
overall. 

And 
I 
think that this 
department, as much as it might object 
to the rather strong direction I've given 
it, knows more about its place, where 
it's going·and what they needed to do 
to get there." 

Few would question that Ryan has 
strengthened the organizational and 
financial state of his department. In 
that sense, he has been a success. But 
the "rather strong direction" he refers 
to has been a bone of contention for


years. In the process of restructuring 
Yale athletics, Ryan generated mixed 
feelings, both in and out of the 
department, ranging from praise to 
anger to sheer frustration. His critics 
claim that Ryan has made as many 
problems as he has improvements in 
the department. 

At worst, Ryan has been called a 
cold and insensitive administrator who 
sought to maintain a 
well-oiled 
machine rather than to meet the 
human needs and concerns of coaches 
and athletes. Ryan has also appeared 
unsympathetic to women's athletics in 
recent years, most notably through 
several incidents involving women's 
gymnastics and volleyball. Those 
controversial incidents, coupled with 
numerous 
complaints 
of 
mismanagement from athletes, have 
become gospel for- critics seeking to
