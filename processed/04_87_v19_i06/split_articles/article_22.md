possibility of exempting teaching in-
come from the student budget limit." 
If Pollitt succeeds in eradicating the 
income limit, his action will have far-
reaching 
effect~. Horror stories 
abound about departments and profes-


sors manipulating Yale's rules or 
exploiting the vulnerability of graduate 
students to exact assistance at low or 
no wages. The income limit lends itself 
to such abuses. In one small depart-
ment, two third-year students without 
jobs or stipends applied to teach a 
popular course. But the dep;utment 
passed them over in favor of a second-
year student who was already teaching 
a 
language 
class 
in 
addition 
to 
collecting a stipend. Anxious to TA the 
prestigious class, the student accepted 
the appointment, t.10ugh it would pay 
her nothing. Instead of ensuring broad 
distribution of financial 
aid, 
the 
income limit enabled the department 
to avoid paying a TA. 

Though he has fond memories of 
Yale's professors and students, 
Houchang Chehabi (GRD '86) sees its 
administrators in another light: "The 
whole Graduate School bureaucracy is 
pervaded by a culture of pettiness, 
narrowness, and lack of imagination." 
Having worked as a TA for several 
classes and taught four courses and two 
college seminars, Chehabi, a Prize 
Teaching Fellow, applied to teach 
another college seminar in the spring 
of '86. Though he had the backing of 
two colleges and of his department, 
which was short of junior seminars, the 
Graduate School administration 
declared that he had taught too many 
courses to be eligible to teach again. 
But as a foreigner on a student visa, 
Chehabi could not work outside the 
UniversitY or qualify for federal loans. 
In the end, Yale came through with a 
loan-at 12 percent interest. Now an 
assistant professor at Harvard, 
Chehabi reports that TAs there earn 
more and work less. But his biggest 
complaint about Yale's system does not 
center on salaries. "It's the treatment," 
he says. ~One gets no respect." 

Whether or not Yale's TAs gain that 
respect will depend largely upon their 
ability to pull together. The Pollitt 
Committee may go a long way toward 
meeting demands for detailed, 
published job descriptions to 
standardize the TA system in all 
d~partments, perhaps by next year. 
But the Provost's efforts to prevent the 
committee from examining Â·salaries 
suggest that no major increase in the 
$2.6 million Teaching Fellow budget is 
forthcoming. Graduate students may 
have to force action on that front. 
The group in Machine City thinks that 
the T As can do it. "A major fact of life 
is that we're poor," Lieberman says. 
This common problem, the group 
feels, will lead graduate students to act 
collectively. According to one TA, 
"People know so little about the system 
that they just accept things." Once 
their colleagues awaken to 
their 
exploitation, argue members of the 
group, 
they 
will 
unite and, 
if 
necessary, take action. 

But Pollitt disagrees: "Those people 
who came to me and said, 'If you don't 
do something instantly we're going to 
strike!' I felt were extraordinarily 
naive." Though the Natural Sciences 
supplied 374 of the 967 TAs in Yale 
College last year, the group of would-
be organizers boasts no representatives 
from that division of the Graduate 
School. Job descriptions in terms of 
number of hours worked satisfy 
students in the Natural Sciences. Also, 
students there receive far more outside 
funding than students in the Social 
Sciences and H umanities, and conse-
quently rarely complain about wages. 

The organizers face other obstacles. 
Graduate students communicate very 
little with one another within 
departments, and even less within the 
Graduate School as a whole. Living far 
apart, these students concentrate on 
their own work and problems. How 
many paychecks would they willingly 
forego? 
Furthermore, 
individual 
financial situations, r~flecting family, 
University or outside funding, vary 
widely, 
weakening any sense of 
common experience. And graduate 
students are an extremely vulnerable 
group; 
the professors they might 
estrange by striking are the same 
people upon whom they depend to 
further their careers. "The graduate 
body is ctivided," Jepson says. "It's 
silent, it's silenced, and it isn't easy to 
get together and be heard." 

But TAs have struck before. When 
Philosophy TAs withheld grades in 
January, 1972, Yale capitulated almost 
immediately, doubling their pay. This 
action sparked wildcat strikes 
throughout 
the Gradu11te. School, 
causing Yale to initiate the_ studies that 
led to today's system. Perhaps the 
radicalized TAs organizing in Machine 
City can convince their peers that their 
individual concerns 
fit 
larger 
Houcbang Chehabi (GRD '86) says T As 
at Yale get "no respect." 

scheme. In general, graduate students 
have heard about the group. And when 
asked about striking, they react almost 
uniformly: at first, students chuckle or 
roll their eyes, perhaps scoff at the 
idea. 
T hen they reconsider, 
and 
appear startled by their conclusion. 
One woman paused and then said, as 
though speaking to herself, "When you 
think about it, we could really stop 
things completely." 

"Is this the meeting of the T A 
Solidarity Group?" Huginnie looks up 
and smiles. "Sure is. Take a seat." 
H uginnie sits at the crowd's center, 
taking notes as she gathers suggestions 
on actions the group should take and 
dividing responsibility for following 
through. The advisor from Local 34 
cuts in frequently, "In January," she 
says, "there's a possibility of 4000 Yale 
workers going out on strike. You have 
to figure out what your relationship to 
them is going to be." She provides tips 
on dealing with the Yale Corporation, 
pressing the group to take specific 
actions. "You don't organize by paper," 
she says. Huginnie runs through the 
list: posters announcing the &raduate 
student forum to be held April 21; 
graduate students at the Corporation 
breakfasts on Saturday; a deluge of 
calls to the Graduate School deans and 
President 
Benno Schmidt with 
requests for appointments; calls to 
other graduate students and to 
sympathetic faculty. There may be 
pickets on Class Day. And there may 
be a strike next year. 

And there will be another meeting in 
a week, to prepare for the forum. 
"Bring a date," calls Huginnie, as the 
students rise to leave. "Bring someone 
else who wants to work, or just to 
listen." Singly and in small groups, the 
TAs disperse, leaving behind a couple 
of Coke cups, a few scattered papers, 
and four lone undergraduates studying 
intently to the jarring accompaniment 
of the change machine.
