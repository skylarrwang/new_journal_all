"I don't know what the 
hell I'm doing when I 
go into rehearsal. I 
just have the faith that 
it will come to m e." 
When 
the Chapel Square 
Mall 
reopened 
in 
1984, choreographer 
Sandra Kopell performed a special 
dedication. "Two shopping nymphs 
danced around the fountain," she 
explains. "Thf' soundtrack was 
Muzak, and we threw money and 
were burdened by oversized credit 
cards. We also danced on the escalator 
as part of the performance. Looking 
back. r wish I had done an entire piece 
on the escalator." 


The~: dance 
took 
place 
at 
the 
bcginning of Kopell's career as a New 
Ha,·~·n artist. Two years later she met 
\.-1ary Ramett and .Judith Phelps. also 
mod~·rn clancc. choreographers. and the 
thn·e women began to work together to 
create claoK~·s and en~nts at which to 
perform tht·m. Tht•ir first efforts have 
paid off. as laq(t'r crowds attend their 
pl"rfonnances. The n·sult. clann·rs 
agn·~·. is <• resurgcm·e of community 
intt'l"t·~t in an art that has attraned 
littk support for the past ten years, 
since New Haven's dance scene went 
into decline. But as yet, this renewed 
interest has not generated broad-based 
community support or the kind of 
financial backing necessary to sustain a 
sizeable dance movement. The idea of 
modern dance elicits shrugs of 
ignorance from many people who 
think of all dance as ballet, and 
grimaces 
from 
others 
who 
view 
modern as too surreal, too cerebral, or 
just too weird. Through audience 
education and 
greater exposure, 
Barnett, Kopell, and Phelps hope to 
make their work more accepted and to 
smooth ·the way for other choreo-
graphers. 

According to Kopell, the modern 
dance scene had dwindled d rastically 
,.,•hen she arri\'ed in New Haven from 
New York four years ago. Government 
cutbacks had eliminated the three 
main companies and schools, and 
many choreographers had left for New 
York, at that time considered the 
center for 
modern dance. 
K opell 
organized several projects herself, such 
as a dance marathon for the New 
Ha,·en- Leon, Nicaragua Sister City 
Project. but the major turnaround did 
not 
occur until 
last 
year 
when 


approximately 
eight 
local 
dancers 
formed a choreographers' workshop. 
The showcase of resulting work 
became Dance Gallery, now in its 
second year. By the second set of 
performances last January, audiences 
had grown from family and friends to 
sell-out crowds totalling more than 150 
people. 

The Dance Gallery also 
brought Barnett, Kopell, and Phelps 
together. 

In rehearsal for a work Kopell has 
choreographed 
for 
Yale 
Art 
Gallery's National Museum Day on 
May 16 and 1 7, the three display 
individual styles that clearly 
distinguish modern dance from ballet. 
Layers of leotards, tights, parachute 
pants, and t-shirts cover bodies that 
are solid and muscular, not emaciated. 
The dancers' feet, not clad in toeshoes,. 
remain bare. Kopell explores each 
movement of her dance with the 
detachment of a painter evaluating her 
brush strokes. The other dancers 
provide a study in contrasts: Barnett 
moves energetically, like an 
enthusiastic child, while Phelps 
appears 
implacably 
self-assured. 
Kopell beats two sticks together to 
provide rhythm as the dancers run 
through the piece again and again. 
Occasionally she gives instructions, 
always on the beat. "And keep breath-
ing," she prompts. "And a gallop, hop, 
brush. Nice!" The dancers finish by 
bumping into a studio wall. 

In the studio, the dancers work 
without outside commentary. Once on 
stage, their monologue becomes a 
shared conversation, in which the 
audience may participate with 
applause or with silence. "Sometimes I 
worry about getting too artsy," Kopell 
admits. Nevertheless, she feels that 
inexperienced viewers need not under-
stand the message of a dance to appre-
ciate the movement. Modern choreo-
graphers usually do not have a linear 
story in mind when they compose; they 
select images to evoke an emotional 
reaction. For example, a poem Barnett 
wrote 
college entitled "Going 
Under," dealing with a childhood oper-
ation, sparked one of her works for 
Dance Gallery. "I had surgery on my 
eyes when I was three years old. It's 
obviously something 
I 
don't 
remember, but it made me think of 
surgery as a metaphor for opening. On 
one hand it could be bloody, but it also 
could be the most intimate thing," she 
says. The choreography for this piece 
calls for three dancers, one ladder, one 
poet on top of the ladder, and one man 
in an armchair reading the fluorescent 
pink, yellow, and green pages of a 
newspaper. The dancers take on a 
steely pose with arms jutting up and 
legs balancing at right angles to one 
another. Perched upon the ladder, the 
poet recites "Going Under" and then 
descends to join the dancers. Toward 
the end of the piece, the man in the 
armchair rolls off into the wings. 

Obviously, Barnett does not make 
each movement a symbol for her 
metaphor once she begins to create a 
dance. "I don't set out with a plan 
necessarily, or an idea that I want to 
express. I'm not contemplating my 
navel. I don't know what the hell I'm 
doing when I go into rehearsal. I just 
have the faith that it will come to me," 
she says. Phelps relies on a somewhat 
more methodical procedure: she takes 
an abstract idea such as "how objects 
come together" and redirects it into a 
specific image. That particular idea 
evolved into a dance called "Merging" 
based on the movement of large 
knitting needles; she and Barnett knot 
themselves up in a giant white rope. 

Kopell relies on more visual stimuli 
to inspire her choreography. Formerly 
a full-time graphic designer and illus-
trator, 
she often uses artistic or 
commercial 
icons 
to 
convey her 
message. "I really enjoy taking still 
images and making them move. It's 
kind of like connect-the-dots," she says. 
For a piece Kopell performed in D ance 
Gallery, she played the White R ock 
girl while Barnett portrayed the 
Morton Salt trademark. T hey demon-
strated supermarket folk dances as a 
professor "lectured" on shopping 
rituals. More recently, Kopell has 
moved from the shopping aisles to the 
art gallery halls, with pieces based on 
two paintings by Matisse and on the 
H enry M oore woman in the Sculpture 
Garden. The latter dance's message, 
she says, is more abstruse than those of 
her previous works, moving away from 
the satirical edge that characterized 
many of her earlier pieces. 

Kopell's recent work, along with that 
of Barnett and Phelps, may still scare 
off viewers who are more comfortable 
with images and stories they can 
readily identify. "There's a difference 
between art and entertainment. If you 
don't have to bring part of yourself to 
the performance, then you're looking 
at the Rockettes," she says. But to help
