"It's your education, 
how do you want me 
to spend the 15 hours? 
Shall I grade your 
midterms this week, 
or shall we discuss the 
reading?" 
24 The New Journal/April 17, 1987 
"We need a name. I've been referring 
to us as the TA Action Group." 
It is 8:30 on Thursday night in 
Machine City, and the meeting has 
just started. Laughter of students 
sitting at distant tables mixes with the 
sporadic chatter of the change 
machine, drifting to the round table in 
the back where four angry teaching 
assistants sit 
waiting 
for their 
colleagues and thinking of a name. 
"TAs for a better Yale, we could call 
ourselves." 
"But we need a good acronym-you 
know, like POOR." 
"Let's use some Middle Eastern 
imagery. 
Let's 
call ourselves 
Graduate Student United Front." The 
woman pauses, grinnmg. "Or the Arm 
nf God." 
Now three other graduate students 
arrive and the selection of a name is 
put on hold. One woman draws a 
xeroxed circular from her knapsack 
and scatters copies around the table. 
After discussing the letter, the others 
agree to distribute it to all graduate 
students. "Don't WannaBe Your Beast 
Of Burden," the text proclaims. "TAs 
say 'No More Exploitation.'" It goes on 
to describe the two concerns which 
unite the members of the group: low 
salaries and the lack of job descriptions 
to standardize the levels of teaching 
assistants (TAs) throughout Yale's 
departments. Individually; many TAs 
complain about each of these issues; 
the members of this nameless group 
believe that they can unite their peers to 
address both.
