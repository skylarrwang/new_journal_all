EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Two weeks later, on April 8, the 
same seven TAs have again gathered 
in Machine City. They now have a 
name: the TA Solidarity Group. And 
they also have company. Eighteen 
graduate students and one representa-
tive of Local 34 cluster around the 
table,· drawing curious glances from 
undergraduates. The mood has 
changed. Gone are the joking and the 
casual digressions of the first meeting. 
Other than the original seven, most 
seem not to know 
each other. 

Common experience and common 
anger have brought them together in 
Machine City. If no one addresses 
their concerns, common frustration 
may bring them to the picket lines. 
The group began building slowly last

fall. Rhonda Lieberman (GRD '90) 
and Anna Blume (GRD '90) met with 
Yale administrators last semester to 
complain 
about 
the TA 
system. 
Through 
the 
Committee on the 
Graduate School, an 
advisory 
committee to the graduate deans, they 
persuaded the Graduate School to 
distribute a questionnaire to all TAs at 
the beginning of April. The letter to 
the administration accompanying the 
survey warned, "A spectre is haunting 
Yale-the spectre of TA solidarity." 
Feeling that the administration would 
not go far enough in changing the 
system, Lieberman and Blume turned 
to other TAs to build a collective voice. 
Lieberman says that the graduate 
students 
they have contacted re-
sponded enthusiastically. "People were 
so relieved to find out that others 
were in dire straits financially. They 
just thought they had been given a raw 
deal as individuals." The TAs found 
that they share other criticisms. Yale, 
they say, provides them with no job 
descriptions, 
no job training, 
no 
explanation for their pay, and nowhere 
to take their complaints. Some TAs say 
that feeling exploited leads them to 
resent their undergraduate students, 
who they say are the University's 
priority. More frequently, TAs refer 
affectionately to their "kids" and worry 
that poor pay and long hours prevent 
them from teaching effectively. 
Proud of encouraging contact 
between undergraduates and faculty, 
Yale's 
administrators have resisted 
expansion of the TA system. Before 


Rhonda Lieberman (GRD '90): being a graduate student at Yale is like "being a 
townie at a resort." 

1972, when the University provided 
most graduate students full fellowshtps 
covering tuition and living expenses, 
assisting a professor in the College was 
considered a privilege; TAs earned an 
honorarium of S300 a semester. But as 
fellowship funds shrank in the late '60s 
and early '70s, Yale began encouraging 
graduate students to work in the 
College to support themselves. And the 
number of 1'As grew. 

The Humanities and Social Sciences 
now offer their students stipends of 
varying 
amounts 
to 
cover living 
expenses for the first 2 years. after 
which they expect them to teach. 
Last year, 967 graduate students 
worked one or two semesters as TAs, 
filling 
1521 
teaching appoint-
ments. According to Robert Bunsel-
meyer, associate dean of the Graduate 
School, "I think it's true that Yale, 
having started from an honorarium 
system, has a bit of historical drag." 
The TA system has not matured as 
the number of TAs has grown, and it 
has no mechanism to set matters right. 
The Provost's office, which finances 

the TA program, has no standing 
committee to receive and evaluate 
complaints. The Graduate School, to 
which many TAs turn for help, has no 
power to address their problems. 
Though 
the group gathered in 
Sterling does not have a formal hierarchy, 
Yvette Huginnie (GRD '89) has taken 
control of the meeting, tapping her Bic 
pen against an open palm to emphasize 
her points. When her stipend dried up 
after two years, Huginnie became a 
TA to support herself. Taking a job 
that interrupted her studies and 
reduced her income by S1000, she 
found that her generous educator 
could be an exacting employer. "I feel I 
was in some way decei,·ed, because 
the)' told me I could support myself 
teaching and that's just not true.~ 
The Provost's office divides teaching 
fellows into four levels determined by 
the number of hours a semester they 
work. According to this year's scale, a 
Teaching Fellow 1, such as a grader for 
a large lecture class, works 75 hours a 
semester and earns S850, a TF2 works 
150 hours for S1700, and so on. Now 
in her third semester as a TF3- the 
most common 
T A 
gradation-
Huginnie earns $2550 from Yale per 
term. She scoffs at the Provost's 
esti~ate that a TF3 should work 
approximately 15 hours each week. 
Attending lectures, meeting with the 
professor, preparing for her 
sections-with a combined enrollment 
of 31 students-leading discusssion, 
and providing office hours, she 
estimates that she spends at least 20 
hours a week as a TA. Since the course 
requires a five-page paper, a midterm, 
a 15-page paper, and a final, four 
weeks this semester she will work 
considerably longer than that, grading 
her students' written work. "And for 
that, I'm paid $510 a month. Which 
after taxes is 
$460." She laughs 
bitterly. "I know this." 
This year, the Graduate School set 
its "budget standard"- the cost of 
living for a single person in New 
Haven for nine months- at $7785. A 
TF3, working both terms, can earn 
only $5100. To ease this $2600 deficit, 
Huginnie has taken a second job, 
working at Beinecke Library 10 to 12 
hours each week. But she still finds 
herself in a predicament shared by 
many of her peers: accumulating a 
large loan debt (in her case, $13,000) 
and looking ahead to a career in 
academia, where salaries can support 
few interest payments. 
Since he became dean of the 
Graduate School last July, Jerome 
Pollitt has been trying to address 
graduate students' complaints about 
the TA system. "I would say the 
biggest challenge of my deanship is to 
try to bring some order and regularity 
and fairness into the Teaching Fellow 
program." A slim man with thinning 
reddish blond hair and a soft, clear 
voice, he sits in his office in HGS, 
spring sunshine spilling through the 
large bay windows. "I tried to persuade 
the Provost [William Nordhaus) 10 
form a heavy-weight Provostial com-
mittee to deal with this question," he 
says. Though denied this request, he 
convinced Nordhaus to allow him to 
establish an informal committee 10 
examine the system. Th.e Provost's 


the TA program, 
directed the Pollitt 
Committee to pursue only adminis-
trative issues and to make no recom-
mendations on salaries. 
But the 
committee is examining pay scales at 
other universities and plans to report 
its findings. Isn't that tantamount to 
making recommendations on salaries? 
Pollitt smiles slightly. "There will be no 
formal 
recommendation. 
I 
mean, 
we're certainly not going to keep the 
results of our inquiry secret." H e 
suspects that Yale will have to raise its 
TA salaries to be fair and to remain 
competitive in attracting students. 
The TAs claim Pollitt will discover 
that H arvard's TA salaries exceed 
by 
75 
percent. 
differences in the universities' job 
descriptions hinder comparisons, close 
approximations 
m ay be drawn. 
According to 
H arvard's teaching 
fellow coordinator-, Marilyn Larner, 
a "two-fifths" puts in 20 hours a week 
handling two sections and therefore 
would roughly correlate with Yale's 
TF3. At H arvard, two-fifths this year 
earn $8920. According to Bunsel-
meyer, -who is assisting Pollitt in 
examining the TA system, third and 
fourth year students at Harvard pay a 
'low tuition' of $2,800, while those at 
Yale generally pay none. Apparently,
