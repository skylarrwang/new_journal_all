southern dialect, and only bits and 
pieces came through. For the most 
part, they spoke so quickly the ends of 
their sentences trailed off in low, 
barely audible words. 


I kept thinking they were talking to 
me, and not wanting to ignore them I 
jumped up three times. Finally, they 
came into the living room. Evelyn's 
grandmother stuck out her hand to 
meet me, then swept me up i!1 a hug. 
She was sending Evelyn and me on an 
errand 
to 
buy 
a 
lottery 
ticket, 
buttermilk, and snuff. I thought for a 
second, remembering snuff from a 
song, but unable to picture it at the 
market. 

We started at the liquor store to buy 
the lottery ticket. Evelyn's grand-
mother had already picked a number 
as she did every day, so far without 
success. Ticket in hand, we went to the 
Congress Supermarket, a large store 
with selections of Spanish dishes in 
addition to the usual foods. In the 
refrigerated section tucked in the back 
was our buttermilk. Before leaving, we 
spent another ten minutes helping a 
woman find a stick of lard for frying. 
She looked bored and tired, but her 
face brightened at the sight of Evelyn. 
Somehow we just couldn't find the 
lard, and with Evelyn holding her arm 
to steady her, the woman laughed at 
the shelves of food, in some way very 
funny then, every row like a head 
shaking no, the lard isn't here. We 
finally found it and went to buy the 
snuff. Going into the next store was 
like entering a cave. Only a faint light 
was on, and we weaved past the figures 
of several men standing around the 
room, their eyes trailing Evelyn. She 
bought the snuff, and I was glad to 
leave there and go home. 

We walked up to the side of her 
grandmother's house, 
and two 
wrinkled hands reached out from the 
basement window. I felt like part of a 
secret transaction as the hands quickly 
pulled in the, _goods. T hen they pulled 

in 
my own hands. 
"Susan, 
for 
Thanksgiving what're you thinking to 
do? I got the whole room here, only for 
myself, and you come eat with us if 
you want. You can see how much 
room I got." 

By the time I came back to Yale this 
past fall, Evelyn, her family and I 
openly expressed our affection. I loved 
calling when Evelyn answered the 
phone because her greeting would 
change at the souno of my voice. 
Hello, she would repeat, but with a 
squeal. Her mother hugged me when I 
came over, her arms wrapped around 
me as she laughed. She would ask me 
to watch her kids while she went to the 
store, or she would send me to the store 
instead. Now she didn't apologize for 
the clutter, the ripped housedress she 
was wearing. One afternoon as I was 
leaving she put her hands on my 
shoulders for a few seconds, and her 
eyes-often darting from the front 
door to a child crying to something 
cooking on the stove- momentarily 
became calm and looked directly at 
me. She tightened her grip on my 
shoulders. "You two, you been good 
girls," she said. 

This year, Evelyn talked less about 
school and more about boyfriends. 
During our first visit in September, we 
sat in the Chapel Square Mall for two 
hours drinking cokes. She told me 
about Bobby, the first to break her 
heart. "All of a sudden he didn't call, 
and my homegirl, right, she said she 
seen him with this other girl, only I 
knew he didn't love her 'cause he loved 
me, right. And lhen that same girl I 
heard from someone else he was with 
her again, and I heard this one night 
he was at my homegirl's house, on her 
porch, right, and I went there and he 
said Evelyn I guess maybe you want 
your chains back and I said well, 
Bobby when did I ever say that, right, 
and he took them off his neck and I just 
couldn't even look at him then, Susan, 
I just couldn't look, and I went home 
and no one was there and the phone 
rang but I didn't get up, and then I 
took a bath, Susan, for a long time. 
My homegirl called and wanted to 
come over but I said no, and Susan I 
picked up them chains, right, in my 
bed, and well, he had this wavy kind of 
hair with oil on it, and the chains 
smelled like the oil being around his 
neck, and I just pulled them up to my 
face, and I smelled him Susan, oh my 
god I cried and cried. And now, I just 
don't know, I don't know, 'cause we 
never stopped loving each other, 
Susan." 

Despite her sadness over Bobby, 
Evelyn still smiled as she talked, and 
she giggled over the question of 
whether or not I had grown over the 
summer. I was shocked a few weeks 
later when her mother told me she had 
run away from home. The news made 
me feel franticalJy worried about her 
safety and whereabouts. In all our 
talks, she had given no hint that she 
was ever considerin~ leaving home. 
And I could only wonder what made 
her leave, what forces I knew nothing 
about. Â·since October, Evelyn h;tS 
<.:orne home for a short period, then 
gone to live with another boyfriend. I 
still call and leave messages that her 
mother promises to relay. 

Last month marked two years since 
first met Evelyn. I keep remembering 
what happened when I left her that 
first day. It was a Sunday, and I waited 
at the bus stop looking at the buildings 
in the growing darkness, the shadows 
and the handwritten words on the 
church door beside .me, "Sunday 
service, all welcome 6:00." People 
started trickling in. I received a nod or 
two as families walked into church, 
some followed by a man or woman 
alone, a straggler summoned at the 
door. Immediately, I felt more at home 
in the neighborhood. As voices began a 
hymn, I smiled thinking about the 
faces, thinking I knew them. But a few 
minutes later, it occurred to me what I 
must have looked like from a distance. 
from down the street, my body leaning 
against 
the church door. 
An 
emptiness replaced my smile, a feeling 
that could only have been one thing, 
longing for home.
