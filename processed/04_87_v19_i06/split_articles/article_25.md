Ryan criticizes many 
of his opponents for 
their vague, subjective 
and often 
unsubstantiated 
accusations.


magazine last year highly critical of 
Ryan's policies and 
treatment of 
women' 
athletics. 
Editors of the 
magazine say they were chastised by 
some of Ryan's administrators for 
be!ng too negative. "Most people are 
afraid tO. speak out, or are made ~o feel 
disloyal if they do," said one athlete in 
regard to criticizing Ryan's adminis-
tration. 

The door to Frank Ryan's office is 
almost always open, and he is fond of 
saying :hat he "maintains an open door 
policy," willing to communicate with 
athletes and coaches at all times. But 
few, if any, of the coaches, studems or 
~ven his own associates have been 
known to take advantage of the offer. 

In efforts to improve communications 
with the athletes themselves, Ryan 
began holding Team Captain 
Meetings three times each season for 
athletes to voice their complaints to 
him directly. "Frank had his ideas and 
would give you a chance once a year to 
break his walls down, but it was 
useless. Meetings were a formality. We 
weren't working together to come to 
solutions. We were fighting against 
him, and that is not the way a 
relationship between students and [the 
athletic] administration should be," 
one varsity team member said. 

Ryan, on the other hand, said "there 
is a curious lack of specificity [in those 
meetings), a lot of vagueness and a lot 
of groping." He asserted that people 
leave those meetings remembering 
only the negatives. "You just don't hear 
about the other stuff," Ryan said. "The 
controversies and the rough edges tend 
to get a little higher profile. The n ice 
things don't. And because I'm at the 
top of the pyramid the blame tends to 
rise up to me. But I think that I bend 
over backwards to be nice and fair to 
people." Ryan argued that most of his 
criticism comes from "a lot of misrep-
resentation and inflation. You tell me 
exactly what I need to do to improve 
the program or improve th e attitude of 
people in the program and I'll work to 
that end." 

R yan believes that 
he's 
been 
sensitive to many problems, both 
personal and admin istrative, th rough-
out his ,years in the department. 
"Unfortunately the world doesn't see 
much of that a~d so they complain and 
are dismayed at some of the things that 
happened," he said. He also believes he 
deserves .few if any of the criticisms he 
has received, criticisms which he feels 
have been exaggerated. "I was h ired to 
straighten it out, to get. it under 
control. That became the stamp of my 
administration. It's hard to do that and 
at the same time remain the nice fuzzy 
wuzzy warm 
uncle," 
Ryan 
said. 

Ryan acknowledges some of the 
strain his strict policy decisions have 
placed on his relations with athletes. "I 
don't know if I could have escaped the 
problems of having to make massive 
budget reductions early, of having to 
make the personnel changes to eradi-
cate the impression that Yale can't win. 
I don't know how diplomatic I was. I 
probably could have done some of 
those things with a little bit more 
finesse. I've always been sort of an 
upfront 
person and 
I 
think 
my 
approach was rather shocking to a 
place that had always been rather soft. 
I don't know if I would have done 
anything differently. 
I'm 
still 
an 
upfront person," Ryan said. "My 
conscience is quite clear." 

Difficulties arise in assessing Ryan's 
ten years at the Athletic Department. 
In concrete matters, 
matters of 
financial stability and w inning 
averages, Ryan can be call.ed a success.


Ryan said he has maintained "an open 
door policy" as Athletic Director. 
But in the face of discontent and 
trepidation both in and out of the 
department, one must ask 'if those 
developments cost too much. Ryan 
will assume his new role at Yale come 
July, a role to which he was perhaps 
better suited all along. And while 
Professor 
Donald Kagan of the 
Classics department serves as Interim 
Athletic Director, the search for a 
replacement .-,ill continue. No one can 
predict who it will be. But many feel 
strongly about the kind of person it 
should be. Ryan hopes Yale will find 
someone "who can blend 
fiscal 
decisions with policy decisions." But 
for the many athletes and coaches, that 
quality does not seem to be a concern. 
They feel the time ha.s come to bring in 
someone who can take the department 
in a new direction. With Yale athletics 
on firmer financial ground than ever 
before, athletes and coaches hope for a 
director with new standards, one who, 
as an athlete put it, "is a little more 
understanding."
