"A major fact of life 1s 
that we're poor." 
then, Harvard's two-fifths net about 20 
percent more from their salaries than 
do Yale's TF3s. 
Huginnie feels that Yale will never 
pay TAs what they are worth, but 
argues that it should pay them at least 
enough to live on. "In that way, the 
undergraduates will get their edu-
cation . .They won't have section leaders 
who are underpaid, overworked-" she 
leans forward, her voice dropping-
"resentful. And Yale will get their 
doctoral candidates out." Huginnie 
seems to regard direct action as the 
TAs' most effective weapon. "As it is 
now," she says, "every graduate stu-
dent 
is donating 
a 
considerable 
amount of money to Yale by working 
20 hours a week. I think there's a lot of 
rc:Jom in there to push some buttons." If 
Yale pays her for only 15 hours a week, 
she argues, she could ask her students, 
"It's your education, how do you want 
me to spend the 15 hours? Shall I grade 
your midterms this week, or shall we 
discuss the reading?" 

Not all the students sitting around 
the table in Machine City share Hu-
ginnie's enthusiasm for using a con-
frontational approach. 
A 
student 
brings up the possibility, and vigorous 
argument breaks out. When one of the 
group's newer members suggests that 
they first try to use the official 
University channels, a woman seated 
across 
from 
him sharply 
replies, 
"They're exhausted." A .gentler voice 
intervenes: "We should at least wait on 
the Pollitt Committee." Throughout 
the meeting, Ray Lurie QE '80, GRD 
'88) has been the voice of mod~ration. 
Now in his fifth year in Renaissance 
Studies, Lurie has taught sections eight 
times in the College. As chairman of 
the Committee on the Graduate 
School, he has been obsessively exam-
ining theTA system for a year. 

On the fifth floor of the Sterling 
stacks, Lurie sits in the office of his 
second job, in the St. Thomas More 
Project, describing the inequities he 
has found in the TA system. Each 
spring, when 
the Provost's · office 
notifies departments of their annual 
allotment for TA salaries, it encloses a 
memo to department · chairmen dis-
tinguishing among the four different 
TA levels. But because this memo 
emphasizes distinctions based on the 
ambiguous index of number of hours 
worked, providing only three sketchy 
models for the types of responsibilities 
TAs perform at different levels, it 
leaves each department great freedom 
for interpretation. As a result, says 
Lurie, "Every department has become 
its own fiefdom." The workload ofT As 
at the same level varies strikingly by 
department. TAs in the Art History 
department reported earning TF2 
wages for working 20 hours a week. 
TF3s in Philosophy and History teach 
two sections; those in English, one. 
Additionally, English T As can earn an 
extra $150 a term by splitting their 
sections in half. Lurie leans back, 
waving his hands in exasperation. "I, 
in the English department, am getting 
paid more to T A half the number of 
students of most of the people I know 
in History." 

Associate Provost Charles Long, who 
wrote the present guidelines, says that 
"There's a lot of m isunderstanding out 
there, which is surprising." Though he 
feels that Yale could never achieve a 
perfectly equitable system, he insists, 
"The last thing we would want to do 
is 
knowingly 
and intentionally 
exploit the graduate students." As a 
member of the Pollitt Committee, 
Long will help come up with more 
descriptive examples of typical TA 
duties to encourage departments to 
standardize their appointments. At 
present, 
the College 
maintains 
contingency fund to upgrade salaries of 
TAs who it determines should be 
higher on the wage scale. But because 
Yale does not provide its TAs with job 
descriptions, many graduate students 
seem unaware both of the pay and 
hours sc!J.les. According to one TA who 
understood the system and had her 
salary raised, "Once you can address 
them on that basis- that you're being 
underpaid on their terms- then they're 
very responsive. But there are very few 
people who know how to do that." 

According to Long, the contingency 
fund would not suffice were many TAs 
at a certain level in one department to 
demand raises. But, he points out, 
there exist other 'Yays to redress 
inequities. For example, professors 
could reduce their 
cours~ require-

ments: "It would surprise me if there 
weren't courses out there which could 
fruitfully, usefully, responsibly reduce 
the amount of writing they require 
from students." In addition, he says, 
professors could test their students with 
exams based on short-answer 
questions, which require less time to 
grade than essays. But this action 
might come dangerously close to 
replacing the undergraduates' 
academic needs with the University's 
economic ones. 

Long argues that TAs should not 
have to spend much time preparing for 
section. TAs, he says, should have read 
the course material at some point 
during their undergraduate or 
graduate careers; having to read it now 
may indicate that they are not know-
ledgeable in the field. But many TAs 
felt that if they did not reread an 
assigned book they would be short-
changing their students. One English 
TA reacted indignantly to the sug-
gestion that he should already know 
the material. "I couldn't possibly teach 
something that I hadn't read that week. 
It would be irresponsible." 

Sometimes, however, students do 
not have a strong background in the 
courses they teach. Frequently, these 
are students in the so-called "special 
programs"- Medieval Studies , 
Renaissance Studies and Comparative 
Literature. 
Because these small 
departments do not have counterparts 
in the College, their students must 
apply to other departments for jobs. 
And in defiance of the Provost's 
regulations, 
many departments 
discriminate in favor of their own 
students. English, for example, denies 
appointments to only 12 percent of 
applicants from within the depart-
ment, but to 79 percent from without. 
Jonathan Friedman, associate director 
of undergraduate studies for English, 
says that his department discriminates 
because the demand for teaching jobs 
exceeds its number of available ap-
pointments. He argues that English 
students, training to teach English 
literature, need relevant experience. In 
addition, he says, English students 
would not be qualified to teach outside 
the department. 

This issue sparked Lurie's interest in 
theTA system. As a student in Renais-
sance Studies, he has had to struggle 
for appointments in English. Now a 
TA for an undergraduate course in 
Shakespeare, he says that the English 
department passed over many of his 
peers, instead selecting less qualified 
students from among its own. "So you 
have modernists TAing Shakespeare 
because they have their pick of the 
crop, since they're in the English 
department, and people who work in 
Late Medieval or Renaissance lit-
erature, who end up in modern 
had a choice: 
literature because 
they get the 
detritus." 

general oversight committee, 
Lurie feels, would erase these prob-
lems. It might also correct problems 
resulting from 
the cumbersome 
bureaucracy. It seems that every TA, 
at some point, has had to fight at least 
once for a paycheck; one was not paid 
until two years after he completed the 
job. Other graduate students report 
even more frustrating encounters with 
theTA program's administration. 

Because of one such encounter, Lisa 
Jepson (GRD '89) joined TA Solid-
arity. Sitting in a Naples booth, she 
speaks quietly, her clipped speech 
revealing her anger as she recalls losing 
her TA position. Jepson began teach-
ing a section of Italian 115 last 
semester. Beginning her second year in 
the I tali an department, Jepson was still 
collecting her stipend. That stipend, 
combined with her salary as a TF4, 
raised her income over the Graduate 
School's budget standard. Students 
receiving support may not earn more 
than the budget standard without 
having their stipends cut, to ensure 
that the Graduate School fairly dis-
tributes financial aid. In this case, 
however, the rule ensured only that the 
Italian department lost a 
needed 
teacher. 
When she returned 
this 
semester, Jepson learned that she 
could not collect both her salary and 
her stipend. Rather than teach for free, 
she quit, leaving her students to hunt 
for another section. 

Yet graduate 
students frequently exceed the income 
limit without being penalized. Jepson 
maintains, "The rules change accord-
ing to whatever is convenient. for the 
administration." 

H owever, what appears so perplex-
ing about Jepson's case is that it would 
have been more convenient for the 
administration - in fact , 
for every-
one- to allow her to teach. But the 
Graduate School administration, 
happening to find her in violation of a 
rule, rigidly enforced it. This par-
ticular rule may not be around much 
longer. In his office in HGS, Pollitt 
tentatively gropes for the words: "rm 
giving serious consideration to the
