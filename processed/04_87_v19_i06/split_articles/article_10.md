Bad Connections
If you've finally figured out how call-
back works, if you can recite your six-
digit access code in your sleep and have 
received a refund for all the numbers 
on your phone bill you didn't call, 
congratulations. You will have more 
changes 
in the phone system to 
contend with next year. The Yale 
Communications Department will 
change student telephone numbers to 
correspond with their room numbers. 
Although many students may find this 
change 
convenient, Jeff Euben, 
manager of Central Campus Commu-
nications, calls it a security risk, 
because anyone- well-meaning or 
not- can readily find out a room 
number and locate a student. 

Changing phone numbers marks 
another step in an overhaul of the 
system which began in 1973. That 
year, while SNETCO continued to 
handle local calls, Yale bought its own 
W A TTSBOX and gained access to 
long-distance trunks. 
After the 
Medical School successfully installed 
its own telephone cables in 1980, Yale 
Communications dec.ided to buy 
phone lines for the entire campus. By 
fall 1986 it owned and operated all of 
its own telephone cables. It leases lines 
from SNET for local calls and employs 
the cheapest lines available for any 
particular long-distance route. 

Michael Grunder, director of the 
Yale Communications Department, 
concedes that "you can't put in a 
system like this perfectly." And, in 
fact, students have been grumbling 
about the phones since they arrived in 
September. Bruce Spiva, a member of 
the Student Life Committee of the 
Yale College Council, maintains that 
"Y ALENET has not communicated 
effectively enough with students. They 
haven't told people how to use the 
system and 
where 
to go with 
complaints." 

Human errors accounted for many 
of the 
transition 
problems 
first 
semester, and the department has 
taken care of most of them. Some 
students who 
signed up 
for 
BASICPLUS never received its new 
features, such as call-waiting and call-
back, 
because 
their orders were 
recorded wrong. 
In addition to 
jumbled orders, 
misenten!d Social 
Security numbers kept bills tied up for 
months, so that a number of students 
still face the prospect of back bills.

Human mistakes also kept some stu-
dents off a mailing list that would have 
informed them of the cheaper BASIC 
system which became available over 
the summer. 

The computers proved no less 
fallible than the Yale Communications 
staff, cha~:ging students for calls to such 
popular numbers as 000-0000. And if 
you think someone discovered your 
access code and made those five 
unexplained calls to Oregon, then you 
should probably request a refund. 

According to Grunder, the computer, 
and 
not 
some creative number-
pqncher, was most likely to blame. 
Moreover, it shouldn't happen again. 
To frustrate would-be code thieves, 
Yale Communications now requires 
that callers punch their access codes 
after the number they are calling 
rather than before. 

Furthermore, 
starting late 
this spring, 
the 
department may begin including the 
number from which calls originate on 
students' bills. 

But some phone problems won't go 
away. Yale Communications will still 
charge callers for staying on the line 
longer than 35 seconds, (for overseas, 
45 seconds) whether or not someone

has picked up on the other end. One 
student reported $20.00 in phone 
charges "just to hear the operator say, 
'We're sorry. All overseas lines are 
busy now.' "Yale's system is simply not 
sophisticated enough to detect when 
someone has picked up. According to 
Euben, such feedback equipment costs 
too much. 

Students already object to the cost of 
phone service. Actually, they pay less 
than New Haven 
residents. The 
YALENET monthly charge for 
BASIC is $14.00, billed as a lump fee 
at the beginning of the year. SNETCO 
charges $16.35 
per month for 
equivalent service. 
Y ALENET 
charges five percent less than SNET 
for instate c'!-lls, and five percent less 
than MCI for long distance. Next .year 
Y ALENET may offer an even cheaper 
alternative for those willing to sacrifice 
long-distance calling: a special rate to 
get a dial tone for on-carppus calls 
only. Perhaps the phone company will 
finally install a welcome change.

Stepping Out
For those who still suffer pangs of 
embarrassment over last December's 
Holiday ball or nervously anticipate 
this year's prom, the Yale Ballroom 
Dancing Club may provide hope. 
Missing her ballroom dancing days at 
M IT, Julie Forman (GRD '90) helped 
Stu Weinzimer (PC '88) organize the 
club last semester. "When I first got 
here," she saif:t, "there was no ballroomÂ· 
dancing club and I cried and cried all 
year. This year I decided to stop crying 
and just start one." 

By following Yale College Council 
guidelines for forming a club, Forman 
and Weinzimer gained a small initial 
budget which they spent on. prelim-
inary advertising for the group. The 
organization now suppor.ts itself, 
relying on a nominal attendance fee to 
cover the cost of the instructors. Elaine 
Mills Solerno, a professional instructor 
who teaches ballroom dancing at 
Payne Whitney Gymnasium, conducts 
the class. She is assisted by Liz Napier 
(Law '90), who teaches one out of four 
sessions. Napier took lessons at a dance 
studio for several years before she 
came to Yale. "There is a real sub-
culture of ballroom dancing. I used to 
go dancing four nights a week at least," 
she said. 

The Yale Ballroom Dancing Club 
and the classes offered at Payne 
Whitney differ in both cost and spirit. 
The fee for the club is $2.00 a person 
per session or $10.00 for a semester-
long membership, 
as opposed 
tO 
$40.00 a couple at the gym. In 
addition, the club is less formal. It 
meets Sunday afternoon in the Dwight 
Hall common room from 2:00 until 
whenever the last couple drags their 
feet from the floor. And unlike Payne 
Whitney, it does not subscribe to the
