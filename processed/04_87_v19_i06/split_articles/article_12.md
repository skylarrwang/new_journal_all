Borderline Friends 
Outside the window of the bus, the square, sand-colored houses of a project looked like a geometric pattern repeating itself down the street. I waited to see the sign of the Sunshine Grocery, my cue to get off. Once outside, I found the number on Evelyn's house, the porch and the front steps, the door and the staircase to the apartment. A large black woman with a blue-patterned scarf around her head unlocked the door, or rather unhooked the bent nail that held it in place. 
"You're Susan, right?" Her voice was deep and husky. "I'm Evelyn's mother. Hello." 

She led me towards tl:te kitchen where something was frying. Four children moved around the table and stove, the smallest trying to climb into a chair. "Evelyn's not ready yet," her mother said. "But I been wanting to meet you." Self-conscious, I sat at the far side of the table trying to look responsible, caring, open, not too pushy, and less scared. But Evelyn's mother barely glanced at my study of expressions. She was busy with the chicken on the stove, one of the children pulling the pants right off her waist. 

Evelyn didn't come in until her mother called her. We had permission to take a walk down the street, and for the next hour or so we started getting used to each other. At fourteen, Evelyn was a head taller than I was, muscular and long-legged , her stride even and calm. In bold matching outfits and large hooped gold earrings, she looked older than I did walking down the street. 
"H i, this is Susan. She's my big sister," she said to a friend of hers on our way home that day. She said it as if I'd lived in her house all along, as if we had the same traces of her mother's voice in us. For the next year and a half, our visits together always started the same way. I got on the bus, rode to the Sunshine Grocery, and ended up in Evelyn's kitchen. We took long walks down Congress, catching up on school or the latest boyfriend. 

Our language separated u s. Evelyn did not know what college meant, she had never heard of being Jewish. And I could only guess the meaning of her "homegirls" and jumped the first time she said "niggers" to mean boys. Much of what she said had a shock element- stories, for example, of fifteen-year olds with several children, all by different fathers, or a boy who killed him~e lf playing Russian Roulette. Evelyn doesn't seem like the right person to describe ugly things. Her mouth is always read y to smile, and she laughs in short, happy squeals. The squeals made some of the things she said even more surprising. She told me she would never have children and would never believe a man when he told her he loved her. "No way," she said. "I'm not having no baby. Uh-uh." 

M y first VISlt with Evelyn was m March of my freshman year. When I called the next week, her mother answered the phone. She invited me back not to her house but to her kitchen, and I sensed the distinction wasn't trivial. "Hello Susan. Yeah, this is Evelyn's mother." I said hello and waited, glad my nervousness was hidden on the phone. "I want to tell you Susan, when you was coming over, I thought, I just can't be nothing but myself, you know, and how's it gonna be letting someone into my kitchen and see me. But if you want you come back, okay?" 

Evelyn's second-floor apartment has four rooms: her mother's bedroom, living room, kitchen and children's room. A large TV in her mothec's bedroom stays on loud. The furniture doesn't match , and hanging beads separate the rooms instead of doors. What's most distinctive about the apartment is the smell. It smells like Evelyn's mother cooking her food, like her brand of cigarettes and her particular kind of soap. The smell is something I can't describe but only know, something intimate that makes me feel close to Evelyn. 

Our Â·walks down Congress con-tinued the next year. Occasionally, we went to the mall, to the Yale Art Gallery, to Old Campus. And a number of times we went on her family errands. During my sophomore year, a week before Thanksgiving, I went over and waited in the living room. because Evelyn's mother and grandmother talked in the kitchen. Both of them large women, they laughed with their hands down over their knees, stumbling around the room. At one point they were out of view, and I realized I couldn't understand what they were saying. Their voices had grown thick with
