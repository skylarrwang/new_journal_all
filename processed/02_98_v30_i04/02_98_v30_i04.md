EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
On November 20, 1997 a female Yale student filed a police report alleging that two Yale juniors had sexually assaulted her. The matter remained private until two weeks ago, when the Yak Daily News ran a story headlined "Two Yale Juniors Investigated for Sexual Assault." The Daily included many of the details alleged in the police report. But, despite the fact that the accused students, were identified in the police report, the Daily chose not to include their names. 

Sex crimes are, by their nature, private. And, unfortunately, sex crimes also make for great news copy. When faced with the choice between running the third installment of an eight-part series on the development of the Broadway strip and the report of a sexual assault case, it's easy to understand a tormented Daily News editor's decision. But since newspapers are in the business of reporting facts not rumors, that decision, we hope, included a basic journalistic judgment call on whether the source-the police statement of the alleged victim-was credible or not. 

No matter what the conclusion on that count, the Daily's decision to report on the alleged sexual assault transformed one woman's personal narrative into a public matter. Rumors of an assault had been percolating through the campus hearsay networks for the last two months, but the particulars of the case, as they were reported in the Daily, are now debated and discussed more widely throughout the Yale community, a community that includes both the victim and the two alleged assailants. There is good reason for concern. In the co-educational context of Yale, few crimes could be more serious. The unisex settings at Yale, from our co-ed bathrooms to our seminars, are all predicated on the idea that men and women do not have to fear one another. By violating that trust, an incident of sexual assault threatens the interaction of ideas and individuals that is the foundation of Yale. 

The Daily was right, then, to make many of the details public. It's curious, though, that the paper chose to exclude the names of the accused in their initial story. No matter how unintentionally, the Daily gives the impression that they suspect the woman's police statement is a lie. If this were the case, the editors should never have run the story. 

On the other hand, one can conclude that the Daily was assuming the worst of its readers. The Daily's choice reflects their perception that the presumption of innocence does not apply at Yale. Who can say that wouldn't be pointed at as they attempt to walk to class? Once their names become public, there would be no guarantees that the allegations would not affect the way a TA might grade work or the way a professor might write a recommendation. But, if the Daily wanted to run this story at all, this was a chance they had to take. Reporting all the allegations in the victim's statement, except the names, insults the reasoning abilities of all the Daily's readers by suggesting that we cannot tell the difference between allegations and convictions. 

It also reeks of the worst kind of old-boy collegiality. The unspoken unity of Yale students can have positive effects. To a large extent, Yale students look out for each other, both before and after graduation. When Yale students work together they can accomplish wonderful things. But this camaraderie can also be a destructive force when the urge to protect one's own means that important information gets concealed. If the Daily editors truly believed that there's a good chance a crime occurred (whether or not the statement gives all the facts), why protect the alleged attackers from the burden of public scrutiny? 

At this point all these questions are academic. Now that the names have become public (thanks to the "Rumors" section of Rumpus) the responsibility for presuming innocence has been passed to the entire community. Are we better than who the Daily News thinks we are?

**Talking Dirty**
**Author: Josephine Coakley**
**Page number(s): 5**

"Hook up"-it's a phrase tossed about all the time at Yale, in the dining hall, during a Sunday night recap of the weekend's escapades, or as a juicy bit of gossip between roommates. Like many people, I rarely heard the term before coming to Yale. Growing up in suburban New Jersey, the expression for any measure of sexual contact was "to go with," as in "Sam and Sue are going with each other upstairs." Yet, after two years at Yale; the noun and verb "hook up" and all its grammatical variations have firmly entrenched themselves in my vocabulary. 

Where did this ubiquitous term originate, and what precisely does it mean? 

A search for "hook up" on the Internet proved fruitless, leading only to sites such as "Hook up Fishing Gear" and the bizarre-sounding, but apparently unrelated "Hook-it's World of Sex." I scanned Sterling's copious collection of slang dictionaries and found no definition for "hook up" approximating the usage we here at Yale are so familiar with. One 1993 dictionary of English idioms defined "to hook up" as "to attach something, to install something electrical or mechanical" while another 1995 volume explained that it means "to travel together." The most telling definition I encountered, however, was in the 1997 edition of the Dictionary of Contemporary Slang. In Australia, "to hook" means "to pick up a romantic partner." The dictionary traced the term back to 19th century Britain, where it meant "to obtain a potential marital partner," and cited the following line from a 1994 episode of a popular Australian television series: "When you hooked Darcy last night, did you sleep with her?" 

"When I was in junior high," laughs Ryan, an Arizona resident, "any two kids who did anything remotely physical were automatically deemed to be 'going out.'" Midwesterners Anita and Santosh and Southerners Dan and Lanna also used phrases and euphemisms such as "make out" or "get together" during their high school days. In a more graphic vein, Ben from Long Beach, California, recalled "get your fuck on" as the term of choice in his high school. I found exceptions to this general rule, especially among students hailing from nearby geographical areas-Karen from local Branford, Connecticut, and New Yorkers Dan and Eugene were all well-acquainted with the saying before coming to Yale. 

So what exactly does a "hook up" entail? James, from Virginia says, "'ve been using the phrase since I came here, and I still don't fully understand what it means. I think the ambiguity of the phrase is why it's so useful." As a way of describing, without getting uncomfortably specific, non-platonic encounters of questionable significance, "hook up" is quite the versatile term.

**Debunking the Stork**
**Author: Erica Wu**

My parents never told me about the birds and the bees. Maybe they were too shy, too inhibited, or simply too embarrassed, but for whatever reason, I never got the heart-to-heart about the facts of life. Instead, when I was 16, after I had already gone through two sex-ed classes, after years and years of hearing word-of-mouth sworn truths about sex, and after four years of religiously reading my Seventeen, and Cosmo, my mom opened the corner of her mouth and asked, "Do you know how babies are born?" Not sure if I should laugh or play innocent, I sat trying to retain my composure and finally answered, as quickly as I could, "Yes, don't worry about it." 

Others told me about books mysteriously appearing in their rooms, tooth-fairy style, followed by the "come talk to us with any questions" line from their parents. Always having been curious how authors could write about sex for children when most parents have so much difficulty even introducing the word into their kids' vocabulary, I went to scope out New Haven's offerings of kiddie sex lit. 

My favorite find was the bestselling Where Did I Come From? by Peter Mayle and illustrated by Arthur Robins. With helpful pneumonics such as "vagina (it rhymes with Carolina)" and "penis... (like peanuts without the 't')" peppered throughout, Where Did I Come From? seems an obvious classic. Tactfully tackling the difficult topic of sexual intercourse, Mayle proves to be a master of euphemism and circumlocution to make potentially racy terminology suitable for young children. Likening the primal thrusts of sex to "wriggling," the (hopefully) pleasurable friction caused by this wriggling to "tickling" and "itching," and the final throes of ecstasy to "a really big sneeze," Mayle succeeds in describing sex in an accessible and comprehensible way for kids. 

On the flipside, It's Perfectly Normal by Robie H. Harris, goes into specific detail about everything a young child might want to know about sex, and then some!, all with a liberal, progressive spin. Starting with a thorough discussion of sex as gender, sex as attraction and desire, and sex as intercourse, this book includes a chapter on heterosexuality and homosexuality early on. Drawings of a bemused boy and a sweet-faced girl explicitly masturbating (separately) accompany the chapter "Perfectly Normal: Masturbation." Some parents may find that their views don't agree with Harris's and some parents may find the book too advanced and detailed for the purpose of telling a child the simple facts of life. 

After seeing what sex lit for kids has to offer, I realize that not even a book simplifies the task of debunking the stork myth. Sex, a simple biological act of nature that everybody does, remains highly politicized-less an event than an issue that demands parents arm their children with what they consider the proper ammunition. It seems to me that the birds and the bees, who just do it, have it much easier.

**Is a Sex Issue Necessary?**
**Author: The New Journal**
**Page number(s): 6**

"There is an erroneous impression current nowadays that sex is everything .... Sex is by no means everything. It varies, as a matter of fact, from only as high as 78 percent of everything to as low as 3.10 percent. The norm, in a sane, healthy person, should be between 18 and 24 percent." 
James Thurber and E.B. White 
Is Sex Necessary? (1929) 

We at The New Journal are convinced of our own sanity and health. In this issue of TNJ, however, sex is everything. This is our annual special issue, our chance to examine one subject from many different angles, and what subject could be more deserving of 100 percent of our attention than sex? 

Sex is wrapped up, literally and figuratively, with issues of our personal identity: race, age, religion, gender, education, and economics. The relevance of sex extends across these boundaries. Thurber and White chose their subject 70 years ago because they saw a change in the way society dealt with sex. We chose ours because we saw something timeless in sex. Sex and identity exist together in an odd symbiotic relationship. Sex defines who we are, and who we are defines our notions of sex. 

In choosing to write about sex we knew that we'd be running a gauntlet that many have failed. In essence sex is a private act, so there's something unnatural about any attempt to write about it publicly. Sex writing is notoriously bad (see p. 46) and we wanted to avoid the tendency among writers to get further and further away from the intimacy of sex as they get further and further into writing. 

Thurber and White confronted this same problem. They discussed the pitfalls that many aspiring sex writers fall into. "We saw, chiefly, that these writers expended their entire emotional energy in their writing and never had time for anything else .... They clearly hadn't been out much. They had been home writing; and meanwhile what was sex doing? Not standing still you better believe." 

Faced with the challenge, then, of seeking out sex in all its forms and metaforms, we adopted the attitude of Thurber and White. "Our procedure would be to approach sex bravely, and frequently. 'Approach the subject in a lively spirit,' we told ourselves, 'and the writing will take care of itself.' (It is only fair to say that the writing didn't take care of itself; the writing was a lot of work and gave us the usual pain in the neck while we were doing it.)" 

We know the pain in the neck that Thurber and White were talking about, but luckily we had the help of the following people in putting this issue together: Annie Barrett, Andrew Cohen, Erika Fricke, Shmully Hecht, Mihira Jayasekera, Katie Lee, Planned Parenthood of Connecticut, John Schochet, and Nick Yorgakaros.

A Brief History of 
Sex at Yale 
N 
0 TOUR GUIDE HAS EVER IMPRESSED US WITH TALES OF 
Old Yale's sexiness. Tradition and heritage are far more 
genteel candidates. But Yale has been populated by stu-
dents of a similar age group almost since its founding; 
and as we are well aware, we're not currently in our quietest days. It 
takes little time to realize that college without silliness, fun, and the 
opposite sex has never really existed. 

pre-1900 
The phrase "Yale class of 1859" evokes images of elite young 
men smoking cigars in a musty room. What does not occur to most 
are the raucous "jubilees" held during this period to celebrate the 
completion of biennial exams. The tests covered all topics from 
Latin to geometry to European history. After they were finished, stu-
dents were ready for some fun, and they more than rose to the chal-
lenge of creating some. 

1900-1920 
"No fooling around with women. That'll queer you absolutely," 
an upperclassman advised Dink Stover, hero of Owen Johnson's 
Stover at Yale. Having a sexual relationship with a woman doomed 
the early 20th-century Yale man to banishment from the prestigious 
secret societies. A big night out meant going to see vaudeville 
dancers and later debating the relative merits of the women's physi-
cal traits. Stover explored other options, like the luncheons periodi-
cally held for Yale students by a friend's family. For Stover, this was 
the opportunity to court his friend's sister, but the relationship 
remained chaste. 

The organized social life of the period was similarly virginal, fea-
turing the junior and senior "promenades" for which a list of the 
attendants and of the chaperones was printed in the Yak Daily News. 
The only hints of intimate male-female interactions are in the Yale 
Literary Magazine, in which Yale men sentimentally described 
women they loved, lusted after, or imagined. 

1920s 
The students exhibited some desire to explore the opposite sex, 
but tradition was still staunchly in place and tend-
ed to cool matters significantly. Chaperones were 
common, both at school dances and on student 
tours, such as ones offered to Europe complete 
with "adequate chaperonage experienced in han-
dling students." 

The jubilees were loud and joyous celebrations 
which involved food, humorous stage acts and 
singing. At times, the atmosphere could be such 
that it was necessary to prohibi~ students from 
swinging on the chandeliers. The plays often had 
certain sexual and vulgar elements {o them, which 
grew until 1865 when the production was called 
an "indecent farce" by faculty, and the use of 
female characters (played by men however) was 
promptly banned in later jubilee shows. Ever 
resourceful, the students responded the following 
year by dressing the "women" in a sort of Turkish 
garb that conveyed the meaning just as well. Per-
haps realizing the futility of their position, the fac-
ulty soon reversed the ban. Among the celebratory 
songs at the jubilee, we find the song "Say Sisters, 
Will You Meet Us?" which concludes: 
~eqUP111S t~ ule&Silft' or 
your c·co.pany nl its 
Advertisements in the Yale Daily News exhort-
ed Yale men to "Say it with flowers" and pay close 
attention to their dress, lest they be one of the 
"lamentable few" who arrive at the white-tie prom 
in a mere tux, much to their "social dismay." More 
casual mingling with the opposite sex would likely 
take place on the European tour as well, with an 
entire ship deck (of the several decks set aside for 
students) reserved for women's rooms. 

Yalies of this decade certainly felt that women 
had a defined sphere--one that was outside the 
classroom. A Yale Daily News editorial rails against 
co-education, predicting "rebellion at an invasion" 
by women, in part because the "difficulties of concentration, already 
great, would be dangerously accentuated" by a female presence. 
"Jupiter spare us from co-education," prays the editorial, "and keep 
the undergraduate schools homosexual." 

Wives of great men all remind us, 
We must take some lovely "quail,n 
And departing, leave behind us 
Boys to send ro Yale. 

1930s 
The decade saw a phasing out of the stern and staid customs of yes-
teryear. Tastes and attitudes began to modernize. Although girls might 
still spend days "deciding the size, length, 'will it go with the tie Bimbo 
always wears' problems," recalls then-Vassar 
student Faye Fation, Yalies had begun to take a 
greater interest in a woman's intellect. 

By the end of the decade, the New Haven 
Register reported that, "Only a scant handful 
of prom girls arrive with a chaperone." The 
Yak Daily News recounted that in preparation 
for the prom, "Swarms of femininity poured 
out of trains coming from the vital centers 
(Poughkeepsie, Northampton, Wellesley) into 
outstretched arms of waitingYale men." 

1940s 
"I don't like Kinsey! I don't like his 
report; I don't like anything about it," Pro-
fessor George A. Baitsell wrote in a 1948 
article in the Yak Daily News. This encapsu-
lates the campus-wide sentiments regarding 
Alfred Kinsey's Sexual Behavior in the 
Human Male, a study challepging American 
myths of fidelity and normative heterosexu- · 
ality published that same year. Kinsey's clas-
sification system for sexual preferences con-
tributed to Yale lingo in the form of the 
term "Kinsey 6," used to refer to exclusively 
gay men. Among those entering Yale that 
year was Martin Duberman (SM '52), a 
"Kinsey 6" and author of Cures: A Gay 
Man's Odyssey, which was published in 
1991. In his book, he recalls making his sis-
ter pose as his girlfriend to avoid embarrass-
ment. His quest to explore his sexuality 
while at Yale led only to anonymous, guilt-
and fear-ridden late-night trysts with 
strangers from the park benches and cruis-
ing cars of the Green. 

1950s 
"The weekends were .all about dating 
and Sf;X," Edward Rosen (BR '50) recalls. 
Weekends were a time of football and 
dances, at Yale or at any of the neighboring 
women's colleges such as Smith, Vassar, 
Wellesley, and Radcliffe. The major events, 
such as the Yale prom and Harvard week-
end, were the most sexually charged. Even 
then, Harvard weekend was an occasion for 
campus-wide parties, and the prom was rec-
ognizably formal and lavish, with live music 
and an elegant dinner. These events were a 
prime opportunity to invite your "favorite 
date" down for the weekend; and there 
would, Rosen says, "presumably be dessert 
after the main course." 

Relationships 
spanned the recognizable gamut. Rosen 
explains, "Some relationships were intimate, 
some were carnal, some were matrimonial, 
and some were frustrating." 

Yale made little effort during this time 
to discourage sexual activity. Girls were not 
allowed to spend the night in Yale dorms, 
and even the Hotel Taft made some effort 
to chaperone its guests. Both rules were 
half-heartedly enforced, however, and if one 
secured a room at the Hotel Gard, he would 
be assured of having no questions asked. 
Another difficulty was that Connecticut law 
then prohibited the sale of condoms, but 
again, determined students had little trou-
ble resolving the problem. "You just had to 
be a little resourceful," Rosen says, and the 
obstacles could be overcome. 

1960s 
Sex was on everyone's mind as Yale pon-
dered co-education. In fact, administrators 
and commentators feared that co-education 
would cause Yalies to think of little else. 
During a trial Co-education Week, the Yak 
Banner reported, "Rapes and other personal 
fouls were consistently avoided." Mixers 
continued to play a large role in the social 
scene. Even with co-education, however, the 
white-gloved 
"weekend 
women" 
were 
bussed in from Smith and Vassar. Only a 
small minority of the Yale student body was 
female, but many of these women were 
offended by the perceived need to import 
women to fuel the sexually charged atmos-
phere of the dances. 

By the end of the 1960s, Julia Preston 
(BR '73), writing in The New journal, 
described the relationships berween men 
and women as sex-or-nothing. She wrote of 
women entering long-term relationships to 
save themselves from unwelcome advances 
from peers, professors, and TAs. The few 
female students rarely formed friendships 
among themselves, and often lived entirely 
within their boyfriends' ~ocial circles. Pre-
ston also mentioned the now common con-
cerns about entering romantic relationships 
within one's college, "because the tense inti-
macy of the community precludes privacy." 
She added, "Yale men and women deal with 
each other through the medium of sexuality 
as if it were an immensely complicated 
peace treaty. You break the terms of the con-
tract and you can expect some kind of war-
fare." She worried that "friendship is in dan-
ger of becoming an insult, merely a state of 
sexual rejection," and argued that the sexual 
liberation many Yalies tout was false and a 
poor substitute for a "full co-education" 
that would allow male-female relationships 
to develop in a healthy f.tshion. 

1970s 
The tension between Yale men and 
women was dwarfed by the sudden accep-
tance of sex in general. Carrie Wingate (MC 
'77) says that sex during her time was seen 
as "just a really nice thing to do with anoth-
er person." Unlike the previous decade 
when women were concerned about their 
reputations, the 1970s attached little stigma 
to promiscuity. The new sexual freedom was 
connected with the general freedom that 
Wingate's contemporaries strove for. "We 
didn't want cars, or mortgages, or posses-
sional relationships." Wingate remembers 
this philosophy leading to empty, frustrat-
ing encounters and repressed jealousy. 

As Wingate recalls, this new permissive-
ness extended to homosexual relationships 
as well. There were still homophobic inci-
dents on campus and, several gay and les-
bian-oriented groups had appeared, includ-
ing {at various times) Yalesbians, the Yale 
Lesbian-Gay Cooperative, the Gay Alliance 
at Yale, and the Gay Student Center. While 
the 1970s were marked by political strug-
gles, such as fighting for permission to 
tabletent in Branford, the decade was also 
marked by an increase in the acceptance of 
homosexual relationships. 

1980s 
Playboy's "Women of the Ivy League," 
issue hit newsstands complete with Yale co-
eds. Yale could not revel in its sexuality, 
however, since this period also brought 
AIDS awareness. Recognizing the dangers 
of the disease and the need for education, 
Yale hired the founder of the Student AIDS 
Educators. During this time, gay and les-
bian groups became more active and accept-
ed on campus, starting a peer counseling 
group and pushing (unsuccessfully) for 
specifically gay freshman counselors. The 
Women's Center and the sexually focused 
feminist magazine Aurora were founded 
during this period.

**Title: Lorna Sarrel: A View from the Counselor's Chair**

Lorna Sarrel: 
A View from the 
Counselor's Chair 
As I walk in the door, Lorna Sarrel is handing me literature about sex at Yale. I begin to sit 
in a chair, but she stops me. She cells me that the chair is hers; the couch is for students. I want 
oo remind her that I am not a patient, but before I open my mouth she has picked up her pad 
and pen-"out of habit," she explains. I imagine Sarrel with a student in her office almost 30 
years ago. She sits in her chair with pen and paper ready. Her patient, clad in bellbottoms and 
a printed shirr, sits on the couch ready to receive the sex oounsdor's advice. I see the same scene 
repeated through the years. After a decade the bdlborrorns are tight jeans; ten }'eal$ after that, 
the printed shin is a flannd. Sarrel counseled students during the 1969 integration of women 
into Yale College, the sexual revolution of the 1970s, the oonservative swing of the 1980s, and 
the (so-far) undefined 1990s. She's seen the arrival of herpes and AIDS, the increased accep-
tance of homosexuality, the onset of the terms "date rape" and "sexual harassment." 

"We're a lot older and wiser as a society, a little sadder maybe, a little less romantic in $0m,e • ·· 
ways, about our ideas of sa," she says, thinking back on her three decades in Yale's Menpf 
Hygiene department of University Health Services. She and her husband, fdJow sex eounselor 
and gynecologist Dr. Philip Sarrel. carne to Yale in 1969. After co-teaching their course, Topics 
in Human Sexuality, to students at prominent institutions like Brown, Smith, and Amherst, 
the Sands brought their lecture to Yale in the spring of 1970. "The very first year we gave the 
course, 1,200 students signed up," she recalls. "The only place big enough to hold it was Bat--
tell Chapel. So we stood in the chapel talking about orgasms and penises-which was a very 
odd experience." They oontinued to teach the non-cm:l.it course oo Yale students for almost 25 
years. But over time, the number of students enrolled in the course gtew smaller and smaller. 
"The whole enterprise ran out of steam. The need fur information now is not as great as it 
once was." The last version of the course was offered five ~ago. 

After years of training and experience, including time spent in 1971 learning fiom Masttrs 
and Johnson-the sex: experts of the era-Sand understands the intricacies of changing sexu-
al attitudes. "One consequence of the sexual revolution was that fur people at Yale there was 
suddenly a pressure to be sexual. It was bad to be a virgin," she says. "That was the sexual rev~ 
olurion pendulum swinging too far." 

Indeed~ Yale, along with the help of the Sarrds, may have lent momentum to this shift in 
attitudes towards sex. Sex and tiM Yak Student, fur which the Sarrels were consultants, exempli-
fies Yale's progressive stance in the sexual revolution. The pamphlet was first printed in 1970 
using funds from the small fee fur their Human Sexuality course. It was written by the Student 
Committee on Human Sexuality, a Yale group remgni7.cd and approved by the university's 
administration. While today's freshmen are inundated with Jecrures and information on sex, 
the first distribution of Sex at Yak made the pages of TheN~ Y01i Tunes. In 1971, an expand-
ed version was published in paperback by Signet. The Stu4ent Guitle IQ Sex on Campus trum-
peted itself as, "'The first sex guide written by college students. for college students. about ool-
lege students." The campus version of the book became graphically explicit-the 1974 edition 
included photographs of people demonstrating how to put on a condom and insert a 
diaphragm. By the 1979 edition, the guide was toned down, the photographs repJaced by 
illustrations. "By the late 1970s, early 1980s, there was a swing back row.uds the more oonser~ 
vative petspcctive, which I think in some ways was good." Sand says, explaining dw one of 
the problems of the sexual revolution was that everyone thought they wa-c the only viigin left. 

It is obvious upon meeting Sand that she's spent many~ rdlccting upon all things~­
ual. She's very oomfonable with the subject. But does thinking about sex all the time lasen its 
allure? Sand puts it best, "My husband and I talk about sex • if it were mrn flaka."

Desire. Consumption. Dissatisfaction. Sex and food at Yale. Take 
for example pork, which you might already know as "the other white 
meat," but perhaps had forgotten may function as slang for makin' 
whoopee, grindin', or doin' the nasty (i.e. "We pocked for 0-5 min-
utes and we both came"). Approaching the average Yalie, we might 
assume that he or she has probably consumed lettuce, french fries, 
vegetable barley soup, and maybe blueberry pancakes. But, have you 
tasted a breaded porkchop? We have no idea. But we do know 
whether or not you have pocked, and even whether you liked it. 
Yale students do have sex. Not all of them (thank God), but 
57.1 percent of the undergraduates have engaged in penetrative 
intercourse {ouch). But bear in mind, the other 42.9 percent are not 
necessarily keepin' their blue-jeans clean. Of this 42.9 percent of 
students not engaging in intercourse, 48.0 percent are having oral 
sex, while 33.0 percent are manually stimulating one another. Fifty 
percent of the non-virgin women lost their virginity before coming 
to Yale, whereas 65.4 percent of the men who have lost it," lost it 
before college (Figure 1). In response to our question, "Were you a 
virgin when you came to Yale?" one particular man, so assured of 
his pre-collegiate prowess, took it upon himself to rewrite our poll's 
simple "no" as "not even close," although he was only deflowered at 
the (gasp) shockingly innocent age of 17. The same boy (we hardly 
think him a man, despite his Marky Mark stance) answered our 
"Have you had sex?" question with yet another personal touch: 
"Yes, a lot," though he has only had sex one time this year. 


While this boasting was most common among male respon-
dents, women also surprised us with gender-specific quirks. Of the 
virgins, 2.4 percent used pink pens, while 3.8 percent of non-vir-
gins employed this feminine hue. None of the men used colored 
writing utensils. Ever. What's up with the girlie ink, ladies? 
And since we're in an interrogative mode, what's up with the 
fake orgasms? Of non-virgins polled, 63.5 percent of the women 
had at some point faked an orgasm, in contrast with only 13.5 per-
cent of the men. Faking may seem like a harmless prank, but realize 
that it only fuels the foolishness of youngsters like the respondent 
above. And what's up with the fake male orgasms? Asked one 
sophomore: "How the fuck am I supposed to do that?" Well, pre-
tend that you're a tired little porker, even though you could make 
another trip to the trough. In the meantime, fellows beware, women 
who fake orgasms, and are left unsatisfied, might just search for the 
platonic form of their simulated pleasure in greener, moister, more 
delicious pastures (Figure 2). They serve pork most anywhere these 
days. (Okay, only three women-hardly a sufficient sample-said 
they always faked it. But hey, we're not doing a Gallup Poll and, 
besides, those two girls must be stopped.) 


A whopping 42.0 percent of the students polled claimed to have 
pulled the proverbial wool over his or her significant other's eyes 
while pullin' the pants off someone else. The question was simple: 
"Have you ever cheated on a significant other? a.yes b.no," but one 
morally self-conscious polygamist opted (as was quite popular in 
this survey) to supply her own answer: "c. Kind of, it was a long 
time ago" (Figure 3). We forgive you. Kind _o£ Give us a couple of 
years. We need physical and temporal distance from this poll. I8J

**Title: When Safe Isn't Safe Enough**

When Safe Isn't S~fe Enough 
K
IM AND HER BOYFRIEND KNEW HOW TO USE A 
condom. They had been in a seven-month 
monogamous relationship, and, like many col-
lege students, condoms were their contraception 
of choice. They never discussed, or even really considered, 
the possibility that Kim could get pregnant. They nev~r had 
unprotected sex. Pregnancy was not an issue. But late one 
night, Kim realized the condom broke. It seemed impossi-
ble at first; it seemed like the kind of accident that could 
only happen to other people. "When I found out rh·e con-
dom broke, my boyfriend became really nervous. I was ner-
vous, too, but I didn't freak out because I had heard of the 
morning after pill. I called the emergency number at Health 
Services the next morning," Kim says. 


Kim's call was not an uncommon one at Yale University 
Health Services (YUHS). Several times a month, students 
call asking for emergency contraception. Through word-of-
mouth, the morning after pill has received quiet publicity 
on campus in the last few years. Student AIDS Educators 
reveal its existence to freshmen, and physicians mention it 
to women who receive contraception from YUHS. With its 
catchy name, the morning after pill sounds like the ultimate 
pregnancy prevention panacea. And, indeed, it is. Well, 
usually. Numbers reveal the limits of the morning after pill. 
When taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex, it is 75 
percent effective at preventing pregnancy. And, while 72 
hours allows for a substantial morning after, 75 percent 
effectiveness falls notably short of a guarantee. 


Kim was well within the 72-hour time frame when she 
called Urgent Care. YUHS responded immediately, and 
Kim met with a physician later that day. Her visit seemed to 
move right along until she learned of the morning after 
pill's 75 percent success rate. Kim found herself weighing 
the odds. In this high-stakes game of chance, the failure rate 
was 25 percent. "The possibility that the morning after pill 
might not work and that I might get pregnant was huge to 
me," Kim explains. Hours earlier, she had witnessed the 2 
to 12 percent failure rate of condoms. On any given day, 
without contraception, she had up to a 30 percent chance 
of becoming pregnant. The morning after pill decreases this 
chance, but introduces side effects including nausea. With 
no desire to conceive and few options, Kim chose to play 
the numbers and take the morning after pill. 


The vomiting started shortly after Kim's first dose and 
continued until the second and final dose 12 hours la,ter. 
Again, the odds were against Kim. Only 30 to 60 percent of 
women experience this side effect. Kim was quite conscious 
of the gravity of her situation. Feeling sick and alone, she 
regretted using only a condom. This accident forced her to 
recognize that contraception is more than just a necessary 
evil of sex. "I realized that sex really does have a cause and 
effect. And I realized that I alone was the one who would 
have to deal with that," Kim says. Within a day, sex 
changed from an integral part of a romantic relationship to 
an action with far-reaching consequences. 


T
hese consequences are best displayed in the waiting 
area of Obstetrics and Gynecology (OB/GYN) at 
YUHS. Chairs line a dimly lit corridor littered with 
subscription offers to American Baby. An endtable overflows 
with issues of Lamaze magazine, the copy of Preparing for 
Fatherhood peeks out from beneath them. Two pregnant 
women wait for their appointments. Amid the drone of flu-
orescent lights and muted conversations, boyfriends and 
husbands are scarce. 


One can easily imagine an anxiety-ridden college stu-

A student sits in a waiting room at YUHS, contemplating the weekend's events and her forgotten diaphragm.  She plans to call YUHS for the morning-after pill, still within the 72-hour window.  The pregnant woman beside her embodies the student's fears.


Dr. Joann Knudson, Chief of OB/GYN at YUHS, explains that the morning-after pill, a higher dose of standard birth control pills, prevents implantation of a fertilized egg.  She emphasizes it's not an abortion pill and explains its mechanism.


However, Knudson omits the emotional side effects—isolation, depression, and anxiety—reported by many women who have taken the pill.  She attributes such feelings to a lack of support, dismissing potential psychological ramifications.


Kim, a student who took the morning after pill, recounts her experience, which differed greatly from Knudson's description.  For Kim, the pill didn't bring relief but instead induced anxiety about sex and ultimately contributed to the breakup with her boyfriend.


Leroy, whose girlfriend also took the morning-after pill after a condom malfunction, describes his feelings of stupidity and carelessness.  Despite their careful planning, the failure of contraception brought home the reality of the possibility of pregnancy. The experience led to a reevaluation of their contraceptive practices.


Kim's experience was far from the simple relief Knudson described; the waiting period brought anxiety and contemplation of serious decisions.  The experience led her to adopt a more cautious approach to contraception.

In cybersex, your partner is faceless, the props are a modem and a 
monitor. The lure of logging on to get off seems dubious. 

''You HAVE To GET A PICTURE INSIDE YOUR HEAD OF 
what you want before you do it," Kate advises me 
as we stroll purposefully into the computer cluster. 
Her directive is stern, but the mood is girly-giggly 
as we sit down at Macs to register for Yahoo!'s chat-line service. 
Our laughter becomes shrill when the Yahoo! server asks us to 
choose an online nickname. Mindful of the rather salacious pur-
pose of this wee-hour venture to Connecticut Hall, Kate tries to 
log on as "moist," but the computer retorts, matter-of-factly, 
"That user name already exists." "Cunning_linguist" has also been 
claimed by another Yahoo! patron, and Kate finally sQcceeds with 
"hotmoist." I'm turned down as both "Caligula" and "littleboots," · 
and must resign myself to the moniker "smallboots." The third 
member of our party, Rachel, succeeds on her first attempt as 
"reddy_2_whip." Tittering like seventh-graders, our eyes meet the 
quizzical stares of slump-shouldered freshmen laboring over their 
Thursday night OS papers. I'm momentarily chastened, but I see 
that Rachel has wasted no time getting down to business. A quick 
glance at her screen places her in the TeenSex chat room, where 
she has announced her arrival: "Hey there, I'm ready to whip and I 
wanna talk." 

It's our maiden voyage on the murky seas of online chat rooms 
in search of a poorly-charted island called "cybersex," a Bermuda 
triangle of sorts where boundaries are confused and eager libidos 
are often lost in the fog. 

"It's always been one of those words that didn't mean much to 
me," a computing assistant shrugged when I asked him for the 
lowdown on cybersex. "Do you mean porn sites on the web? Erot-
ic online chat? Sexual encounters with robots?" I wasn't sure 
myself, but though my destination was uncertain, I at least knew 
the exemplar for the person with whom I wanted to dock. He'd be 
the electronic equivalent of Jim from Nicholson Baker's homage 
to phone-sex, Vox-arch, hyper-literate, a little eccentric, drolly 
aware of the absurdity of the sexual situation but diving headlong 
into it all the same. The kind of guy who gets aroused by the 
sound of a Cacique catalog phone operator saying, "Yes, we have 
the pointelle tights in faun"; describes the expression on his face 
when he climaxes as a "Smurf grimace"; and delivers bon mots like 
"The idea of women looking down at their breasts drives me 
absolutely nutso." 

If Jim has indeed hung up his phone and bought himself a 
modem, he wasn't putting it to any use this night. Perhaps too 
anxious to begin my research, I follow the dubiously named "Mis-
16

taTwerp" into a private room, where he proves himself a frustrat-
ingly reticent cyberintimate. Here I am, itemizing each piece of 
spurned clothing and the manner of its removal and duly noting 
each changed position, and all MistaTwerp can rejoinder with is 
"Mmm ... very sexy." I give MistaTwerp the benefit of the doubt-
after aU, typing with one hand expends precious time and ener-
gy-and launch into a convoluted monologue employing a garter 
belt and an ironing board, but my reverie is abruptly broken with 
the following exchange. 

<MistaTwerp> you still there? 
<MistaTwerp leaves.> 
<MistaTwerp enters:> 
<MistaTwerp> you there? 
<smallboots> I didn't know you had left. I thought you 
were just being your quiet self. Where were we? _ 
<MistaTwerp> you sucking my cock. 
<smallboots leaves.> 

The problem here, of course, is twofold, deriving first from 
technical difficulties ("my computer is mesedup," MistaTwerp 
later apologizes) and second from sharply diverging ideas about 
what constitutes sexy sex. But as Kate later points out, there's lit-
tle that is titillating about these electronic encounters in the first 
place. "I write papers and do e-mail on my computer, and sud-
denly I'm giving some guy a blowjob," she scoffed. ''I'm reading, 
'My tongue is outlining your clit,' and it's not, and there's some-
thing so ridiculous and desperate and sad about that. It's not a 
legitimate sexual arena and I don't think it's socially legitimate 
either. I mean, how could you sustain a cybersex relationship-
how many variations can you do on 'my hand drifts down and I 
unbutton your pants'?" 


T
he answer to her question, of course, did not lie in a single 
field trip to a computing facility. Others find social and 
sexual validity in chat rooms where Kate does not. After 
engaging in cybersex over Internet Relay Chat (IRC), William, a 
junior, arranged to meet his partner in person, commencing an 
intimate relationship with her that lasted eight months. He has 
been a heavy user of IRC for two years, but i:he awkward nature of 
online love srilllingers. "Meeting online acquaintances in real life 
is really funny-it's still embarrassing," William said. "There's a 
stigma attached to it. It's seen as weird and nerdy and not just as

factoring in significant others of the flesh-and-
FEBRUARY IJ, 1998 
blood variety. "My boyfriend had this strange habit of going on IRC 
after every meal," recalled Jason, a senior. "He said he was surprised 
we'd gotten together because by that point he had given up ever meet-
ing people at Yale. He found the gay community self-selective, and he 
wasn't selected. IRC was like an underground way of connecting with 
people who maybe weren't comfortable with the social scene, who 
were interested in flirting or talking or just interested in sex. But after 
we started dating it was clear that his IRC habit was still sexually 
motivated." Rumors that his boyfriend had been unfaithful circulated 
back to Jason following their breakup, but he was troubled by the 
nature of his beau's IRC encounters in and of themselves. "I have no 
idea whether or not he arranged to have sex with anyone he met 
online. What bothered me was that I knew he was propositioning 
people and being sexually aggressive online, and it may have been a 
bluff, but it was still a matter of principle." 

Unfaithfulness by electronic proxy may be a phenomenon pecu-
liar to the Information Age, but the allure of no-name, no-strings-
attached sex is not. Still, true anonymity online seems more the 
exception than the rule. Several of Jason's friends who were also IRC 
frequenters were able to match a face with a log-on name and tell 
Jason about his lover's cybersexual opporrunism. And William was 
hesitant to give me too many intimate details about his online prac-
tices; as he said, "There is a discrete number of Yalies who do IRC, 
and if I said too much they would be able to piece together who I 
am." Which is to say, the lights in the chat room aren't as low as one 
might think. Even the routine warning that flashes on the screen so 
often during transit in Yahoo!-"Any information you may submit is 
insecure and could be accessed by a third party"--<:an seem like the 
bright glare of a policeman's flashlight shining in on teenagers parked 
at Inspiration Point. 

Just as jarring are the non sequiturs to which cyberlovers seem so 
prone to uttering in the heat of passion. Kate, easily the most cynical 
of my subjects, admits she was momentarily won over by "Cainscon-
science," who lured her into a private room on Yahoo! "He lays me 
down on the bed, he's kissing my calves, and then" -Kate's voice 
reaches an incredulous pitch-"he puts a pillow under the small of 
my back, so I'm extra-comfortable while he gives me head." Alas, the 
moment was then irretrievably lost. "And then he says, 'The view 
from here is great!'"

**Sex and the Asian American Male**
**Author: Samita Sinha**
**Page number(s): 18**

HE SETTING: A LOUD YET UNIMPOSING TECHNO BASS BEAT 
fills the comfortable off-campus apartment, the official 
new hub of MOCKA (Men of China Kick Ass) parties. 
Cigarette smoke dings to the slim-fitting black pants of 
attractive Asian American women, most of whom sip the "good" 
drinks, although some courageously chug beer with the men. A circle 
of men-with two self-consciously unself-conscious women in their 
midst-have assembled in the center of the room, replenishing their 
shot glasses with a fresh round of Goldschlager. 

On college campuses alcohol and sex are inextricably linked. In 
Asian American collegiate social circles, this relationship is particular-
ly relevant. Men and women scope each other out across the crowd. 
Silent observation is the modus operandi until alcohol can move 
them beyond timidity. 

MOCKA was formed by a group of Chinese American men in 
1995. Clara Soh (PC '99), enthusiastic participant in MOCKA fes-
tivities, says, "lr was just a bunch of guys who hung out together, 
who decided to make their social circle official-in a silly way." They 
almost incorporated a "W" into the acronym to formally include 
women in their drinking group, but the catchy name and chauvinis-
tic overtones were decidedly funnier to these men. 

MOCKA gets together once every few weeks with the ostensible 
purpose of drinking. Typically, male bonding is associated with 
images of a men's locker room stuffed with football players compar-

ing notes on who got play last night. But when referring to the Kore-
an American community at Yale, Eugene Auh says, "For Korean 
men, sex and sexuality are important. But really, Asian men don't talk 
to each other about sex." Whether it is an exceptional respect for pri-
vacy, personal insecurities, or a combination of the two, Asian Amer-
ican men within the "Asian scenes" do not explicitly discuss sex. 

"A lot of Asian American males feel like they have to measure up 
and that's a big issue," Auh says. "That's something that you really 
don't talk about, you know, you're self-conscious. There's a running 
perception that Asian men have small clicks and shit like that," 

The stereotype of the inadequate penis size of Asian men is a bru-
tal assault on the male ego within American society. In comparison to 
stereotypes of the hyper-sexualized African American man or the leg-
endary all-American, hairy-chested football player, the Asian Ameri-
can man is characterized by a smaller frame and stature. "Ninety-five 
percent of Asian boys are either fat or real skinny," Gene Huang (SM 
'98) says with a bittersweet, nostalgic smile. He, among others, 
admitted to being that short, pudgy Asian boy with a nerdy bowl 
haircut and a peculiar propensity for math. The legs that were 
exposed by his gym shorts were not nearly as hairy as those of the 
other guys in the class. 

At an early age, many Asian American men are aware of the 
American masculine ideal. They are also aware-intuitively, at 
least-of how they measure up to this ideaL They may not actively

During his iunior year of high school, 
Gene Hudng (SM '98) experienced an 
abrupt transition from being an 
outsider Asian nerd to the big man 
on campus. "The social image I have 
set up for myself is one which is 
consciously, actively trying to escape 
the fact that I am Asian American," 
Huang says. 


process the impact their physical differences have upon their self-
esteem and sexual identity, but often the real awareness comes 
retroactively. Of course, the childhood experience of an Asian man 
growing up in Orange County, California-where the Asian popula-
tion of a public high school may comprise 50 percent of the stu-
dents--differs markedly from that child growing up in a small, pre-
dominantly caucasian rown in Minnesota. 


The American media, however, reaches all of these men. Asian 
American men are emasculated by virtue of their absence. Rarely is 
an Asian American man cast as the romantic Cassanova of a movie or 
television show. The typically petite frame of an Asian woman, on 
the other hand, satisfies the American aesthetic of exotic feminine 
beauty. For example, James Bond's beauty of choice in Tomorrow 
Never Dies is Michelle Yueh. The absence of a sexually virile male role 
model, unless Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan count, breeds sexual inse-
curity in the psyche of Asian American men. Tequila shots are the 
panacea. 


B
ack at the MOCKA. party: A couple of guys are sitting on the 
windowsill in their CK shins and loose-fitting jeans, casually 
chic, smoking th.eir cigarettes and scoping the mostly familiar 
crowd in a disinterested manner as they make plans for the next

of not-so-subtle, knowing commentary. "Hasn't she really been into 
someone else for the longest time? Why is she sucking face with him 
now? Too much to drink." And in another corner: a guy and girl, 
holding their accessory drinks, have a friendly chat while swaying 
absently to the music. In their sobriety, they are physically far apart, 
and each initiation of physical contact is deliberate. Off to the side of 
the room: a group of men-and again, a few women who are man 
enough-assemble for a round of tequila shots. 


There is a common perception among Asian American women 
that Asian American men are more brotherly than sexual or sensual. 
Fuphan Chou (TC '00), a 5'9" Taiwanese American sophomore, has 
never kissed an Asian man and remains outside of the tight Asian 
scenes. She has found Asian American men attractive in the past, but 
attractions are only realized by approaching someone--something 
she finds men consistently fail to do. These men fall short in both a 
literal and figurative sense. Fuphan feels like a "big freak giant" 
around many Asian American men. "You usually flirt with a guy and 
you think, wow, the guy might be interested-in females? period. But 
you flirt with an Asian guy and he becomes your brother," she says. 


Many women within the tight-knit Asian community share 
Fuphan's sentiments, whether it is due ro a specific male vibe, or by 
their own paranoia that the Asian American community will become 
gossipy and incestuous if it views relationships with Asian men in a 
sexual way. The men have to bear the stigma of feeling asexual, but 
not because asexuality is an inherent trait. 


This stereotype is frequently imposed upon 
them. Women, particularly if they are 
entrenched in a scene where there is poten-
tial for gossip, may be guilty of this imposi-
tion. 


The culprit most responsible for the 
emasculation of Asian American men, how-
ever, is the American definition of male sex-
uality. A male is considered to be sexual only 
when he is physically aggressive and bold. In 
an American environment of large gestures 
and overtly sexual relations between men 
and women, there is little room for subtlety. 
~thin Asian cultures, subtlety of expression 
is highly valued. This subtlety often hinders 
the ability to communicate the sexual vibe 
that is so important in American male-
female interactions. "I was never touchy-
feely with people. My family never was, s~ 
· neither am I," Isaac Cheng (MC '00) says. 


This is perceptible in those two feet of space, 
in that physical gap between the man and 
woman swaying to the music. 


In examining ·che sexuality of Asian 
American men, it is important to also exam-
ine who these men are approaching. For 
many Asian American men, the way they 
approach a woman is often linked to her 
race. "I prefer women who are outgoing and 
strong-willed and I often think of Asian 
women as very reserved. Of course, I'll 
approach them directly if they don't seem. co 
have a problem with that," Bertram Chan 
(SY '00) says. For some men, there may be a 
weightiness attached to dating someone 
within their own race due to pressures exert-
ed by family and community. That pressure, 
to some degree, disallows frivolity and free-
dom in approaching women of the same 
race. 


Dating outside of their race presents a 
whole different challenge for Asian Ameri-
can men. Complexities may arise because of 
differences in background, and these differ-
ences obstruct an otherwise open channel of 
communication. Furthermore, as is the case 
with many minority groups, Asian Ameri-
cans feel pressure co dace within their own 
race. Another complexity, one that is purely 
physical, is height disadvantage. Men feel 
extremely insecure about approaching taller 
women for fear they will not be taken seri-
ously. Isaac believes that the only solution to 
such a situation is first co build a base of 
friendship. He says, "You watch movies 
where the woman goes through all these 
relationships, chen all of a sudden she goes 
to her best friend co cry. And that's the one, 
you know, that's the Asian guy! He's sitting 
in the backdrops, he's backstage. And she 
keeps going on stage and coming off until 
finally she's like, 'Oh, there's a guy back 
here!' And that's when you can maybe date 
her." 


A 
new setting: fall 1997, in Gene 
Huang's suite in Silliman. Fair 
amounts of pot and beer are passed 
around for the proudly "alternative" crowd 
at Gene's raging party. He stands near the 
keg, shjrc off, as is expected of him, feeling 
empowered and in charge in his role as 
nexus of the large crew around him. A cou-
ple of guys start screwing around, freaking 
each other to tease the crowd. Never to be 
outdone, always ready co outdo, 'Gene and 
his roommate imitate the guys and soon 
become the center of attention as planned. 
Responding to the excited hoots and claps, 
Gene gives them a show. Grabbing his 
roommate, he sucks his neck until a swelled 
red mark is visible. Gene is satisfied. Angrily, 
the roommate frees himself and vengefully 
reciprocates. 


Talking later, Gene thoughtfully scratch-
es his eyebrow-the one without the silver 
hoop-with his thumb, his cigarette sus-
pended between two fingers. "The social 
image I've set up for myself is one which is 
consciously, actively trying to escape the fact 
that I am Asian American. That label doesn't 
make any sense to who I am. I'm kind of 
oversexed and it doesn't make any sense to 
be really repressed about it," he says. 


Gene's Korean heritage has affected his 
overall identity, specifically his sexuality, 
because he has consciously defined himself 
as not typically Asian. During hjs junior year 
of high school in Minneapolis, he experi-
enced an abrupt transition from being an 
outsider Asian nerd to the big man on cam-
pus. Marked simply by a physical change, 
the way he was perceived eventually caused a 
change in attitude to follow suit. 


Isaac embraces the opposite end of the 
spectrum with the same vehemence but 
without Gene's performative tendencies. Pri-
vate, grounded, and friendly, Isaac feels that 
sex and sexuality are superfluous to the parts 
of his life that really matter. In his easy, mat-
ter-of-fact way of speaking that simultane-
ously puts the listener at ease and on guard, 
he says, ''I'm less willing to be vocal about 
things, less forceful. My approach to sexuali-
ty is not like the typical male sexuality. Who 
aspires to that anyway? None of it sounds 
very good to me." 


The most important aspect of defining 
sexuality in relation to race is reconciliation. 
Both Bert Chan and Eugene Auh seem to 
have achieved a peaceful balance between 
dealing with their "issues" and being sexual-
ly active within relationships. Each person 
works toward or against this balance in his 
own specific way. 


"If you consciously work against the 
stereotypes, you won't be associated with 
them anymore," Gene Huang says, some-
what disturbed by this fact. "But that doesn't 
mean I don't love those pictures of me as a 
nerdy little kid!"

**Title: HIV at the Ivies?**
**Author: Eli Kintsch**
**Page number(s): 26-27**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
I'M WRITING A PIECE ABOUT STUDENTS AT YALE WHO ARE LIV-
ing with HIV and/or AIDS. What I have sent you is a totally 
anonymous interview. I gave this letter, along with the enve-
lope addressed to me, to the person who knows you, and he 
or she got this package to you. The purpose of this piece is to raise aware-
ness. I want to understand better why there is such a stigma; why our cul-
ture demands that HIV patients must keep their disease a secret." I sealed 
the envelopes and sent out the letters. 

I checked my mailbox each morning, hoping for a· response to my 
questions, but no luck. People who knew HIV-positive Yalies-and some 
of the doctors who treated them-had delivered my letters. Yet each day 
at the post office I was greeted by a shiny metal corridor-nothing. A let-
ter would mean a chance to give voice to the silent, the infected. But as 
the days passed, I found myself wondering what HIV meant to the 
throngs hurrying past me and my empty mailbox. 

HIV is here at Yale. Doctors tell me there are HIV-positive· under-
graduates. Students tell me they have friends with HIV. Yet HIV 
is an issue few discuss, few consider, and few grasp as part of 
their lives. In 1995, The New Journal devoted an entire issue to AIDS 
without a mention of the disease on campus. Three years later, HIV 
remains an issue from which most students consistently distance them-
selves. Why do so few people consider this disease a part of their day-to-
day lives? Why don't we think it happens at Yale? 

"HIV at Yale? It's just something I guess I never thought of," Arturo 
Martinez (ES '99) says. "I only think about it when I see it in magazines, 
on TV. It's not an everyday topic of discussion." In trying to learn about 
HIV's psychological presence at Yale, I encountered this distancing in stu-
dent after student. Most everybody realizes that HIV exists, but few see it 
as more than a public service announcement or news story. But whether 
or not we think we know someone who deals with HIV at Yale, the virus 
is in our midst. 

"The rate of HIV occurrence within the Yale community is 0.5 
percent, the same as the rest of the American population," Dr. James 
Perlotto (ES '74), University Health Services' AIDS specialist tells me. 
"I believe there are 25 to 75 people with HIV at Yale. The majority of 
those are graduate students, but there are undergraduates who test pos-
itive for HIV." In a 1994 study of 24 college campuses, the Center for 
Disease Control reported that 1 in 500 students tested positive for 
HIV. Yale is no different. HIV is here. 

In the U.S., the AIDS epidemic has entered a somewhat hopeful 
phase. Over the past five years, researchers have found effective ways to 
deter the growth of HIV. A 1996 New York Times Magazine article by 
Andrew Sullivan, entitled "The End of AIDS," argued that with the 
advent of protease inhibitors and multi-drug cocktail regimens, AIDS 
would become an analogue to diabetes and other chronic diseases-a life-
altering condition, but not an instant death sentence. What once was a 
nation facing the uncertainty of a plague can now view the next five years 
of the epidemic with very cautious optimism, even as the disease contin-
ues to slowly spread. AIDS is no longer quite the "sexy" media topic it 
once was, though third-world and inner-city rates of infection skyrocket 
and the poor cannot afford the medications that allow infected patients 
to fight the disease. 

I began searching for HIV-positive students in order to hear what cop-
ing with the virus meant to people at a place so established and intel-
lectual that its emotional tenor can at best be described as aloof. With 
the knowledge that fellow students have HIV, I talked to undergraduates 
by the dozen, explaining what I was doing. I spoke at meetings, to sports 
teams, to classmates. I called and called and called. Still no responses. 

Soon I realized it wasn't the students who knew people with HIV 
who would answer my question. Instead it was the people who didn't 
know someone who would tell me the most. As I explained that I was 
writing about HIV, the majority of students readied themselves for policy 
questions and prepared their most enlightened attitudes for the safe-sex 
survey queries we're all used to. When asked matter-of-factly if they knew 
someone who had HIV at Yale, I saw my classmates act uncomfortable, 
put-off, and initially skeptical. 

Most were very surprised by the statistics. At first, hearing that one in 
200 people in the Yale community has HIV was frightening. And many 
did not believe that students had tested positive at YUHS. 

"College students think they're supermen," Angel Falcon, (ES '99) 
says. "People talk lots about hooking up at Yale, but no one ever men-
tions getting HIV or anything else. When I go home to Jersey, people talk 
about HIV much more-people are scared." 

Many students aren't surprised that HIV isn't discussed. "Yale is a dif-
ferent community than most," Cameron MacDougall (ES '98) explains. 
"Not to be elitist, but the reason that HIV isn't an issue here is that you're 
dealing with a highly educated population, coming from good homes. 
They know the proper precautions to take, and they're less sexually active 
than most students. If this were UVA, it would be a different story." 

Dr. Perlotto knows the story is, in fact, not "so different. As an AIDS 
specialist, his HIV-positive patients come to him to talk about the disease 
and get help. Since his arrival at Yale in 1990, he's broken the news to 
dozens of HIV-positive students, made close associations with many 
patients, and mourned the deaths of students alongside their families. 
-THE NEW JOURNAL


Depending on the week, 5 to 20 percent of Dr. Perlotto's caseload is 
devoted to HIV counseling, testing, and treating his nine graduate student 
HIV patients-some with symptoms of AIDS. Dr. Perlotto's patients 
research, work on their theses, and teach sections. AIDS is only debilitat-
ing in its late stages and few show visible symptoms of the disease. 

Watching Dr. Perlotto speak candidly about the difficulties of treat-
ing AIDS patients, I see how he has gained a reputation as an honest, 
dedicated caregiver. Yet even at an "enlightened" place like Yale, Perlotto's 
reputation as "the AIDS doctor" can frighten non-HIV patients. "Some-
times people are afraid to come see me for anything," he says, frustrated. 
"They're worried that someone will think they are coming to be treated 
for AIDS." 

HIV is an issue on every campus. People are concerned," says 
Shannon Morrison (TC '00), an AIDS educator and coordinator of the_Yale Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender 
Co-op. "The disease crosses boundaries of race, color, sexual orientation," 
Morrison says. Yet he also feels that as the issue has become more politi-
cized, it has receded into the margins. "Although the disease touches a lot 
of our lives, a lot of people still don't believe that AIDS is not a gay thing. 
A lot of straight people are tired of hearing about AIDS." 

But aren't the risks of infection negligible in college? Dr. Alvin 
Novick, the Yale professor whose class, AIDS and Society, usually attracts 
several hundred students, warns that despite the relatively low incidence 
of the disease among college students, it should not be ignored. "Incidence 
of HIV infection in college students is quite low," Dr. Novick says. 
"For those of college age it's not a threat to society, but it's still important 
to talk about." 


I'm dealing with people who see the risk of infection as real enough to come get tested," said one doctor who counsels undergraduates at YUHS. "It's the people I don't see who feel invulnerable." Talking with a 
doctor before an HIV test is one of the few ways students face the reality 
of AIDS. Despite YUHS's policy of confidential testing-in which positive 
results are recorded though kept secret as opposed to the anonymous 
testing available elsewhere in New Haven, in which names are never 
attached to test results-many undergraduates come each week for HIV-
antibody screening. YUHS won't release statistics on testing. However, 
one of the five caregivers who administer tests pulled out a folder of test 
results from the previous year, thick with forms. Between all five they 
must test hundreds of students. "Though a lot of students say they 
should be tested, many never go," AIDS educator Andrew Stadlen (OE 
'98) says. "For many, it's a hassle." 

Still, YUHS doctors have seen a gradual increase in testing as awareness has spread. "In 1985, the few students who came for testing were 
very worried," a doctor says. "Nowadays, getting tested is a more casual 
thing, and many more students come. Some of my patients who come 
are high-risk cases. A few seek testing with an incident in mind, some are 
anxious about a rumor about a past lover, and others have another STD 
which makes them fear HIV. Others show up with little or no risk of 
infection. They are the worried well. I don't look forward to the day I 
have to tell someone they're HIV-positive." 

At YUHS, test results are given one week after the blood is sampled. 
In the ten minutes prior to the second appointment, the moments of 
contemplation in the sterile waiting area can add a dose of bitter reality to 
a hectic day of contrived importance. But once back in Yale World, safely 
negative, it is natural to forget that a moment ago life hinged on one 
word from a doctor. One races off, late to class. That's as close as many 
get to HIV. The test becomes just another way for the Yale student to 
make sure the reality of the disease has not accidentally slipped into his or 
her world. 

Within a few years, however, all of us will probably know people who 
are infected. AIDS is the most common cause of death for American men 
aged 25 to 44, and people aged 18 to 21 are among the fastest growing 
risk groups for HIV. The statistics are chilling. We worry about our rela-
tionships, our jobs, our homework, and our plans for the weekend. Yet 
most Yale students don't worry about HIV. 

Many Yalies go at least part way towards practicing the measures that 
help prevent the spread of the disease. "From an anecdotal perspective, 
freshman counselors report more people are taking condoms than before,

and we are supplying more," Yale Coordinator 
of Health Education Sally Rinaldi (MPH '82) 
says. "We find people are certainly more edu-
cated and knowledgable these days. Whether 
that translates into practice, I don't know." 
At the AIDS Resource and Counseling 
Center, Rinaldi directs the public education 
that Yale students receive about AIDS. "We 
tun the safer sex talks for freshmen in the fall; 
we do presentations for fraternities, for cultural 
houses," she explains. Her elementary school 
" teacher demeanor contraSts with a cluttered 
office decorated with condoms, books on eat-
ing disorders, and pamphlet upon pamphlet 
about HIY. Since corning to campus in 1986, 
Rinaldi has been a pioneer of AIDS education 
at Yale. For years she ran voluntaCy programs 
single-handedly, setting up shop in Commons 
with movies on safe sex. 
The university itself has been slow to recog-
nize the need for greater AIDS awareness. Only 
in 1993, after years of requests from Rinaldi; 
did the administration finally sanction manda-
tory safer-sex presentations. 
The often-ridiculed safer-sex meetings is 
the only time many undergraduates ever face 
the issues of HIY. And in that one hour, the 
messages can get lost amongst the spermicide, 
the dental dams, and the dildos. ''You hope 
that students will retain the informacion we tell 
them at the meetings, but that's often an unre-
alistic expectation," AIDS educator Lauren 
Anderson (MC '99) admits. Other educators 
say students were surprised to see a poster cam-
paign advertising the chance of HN infection 
through oral sex, though the risk had been 
explained to every student at the meetings. 


When students use protection, HN is 
rarely the motivation. "Pregnancy and the 
other STDs-that's the majority of reasons 
people use condoms," Rachel Germany (ES 
'99) says. Cathy Choy (TO '98), an AIDS edu-
cator, sees similar attitudes. "I hear it a lot," 
Choy says. "'I'm on the pill. I don't need to use 
a condom."' 

"Whether or not students want to think 
about what they are protecting themselves 
from, they are using protection," Shannon 
Morrison says. But, he admits that few stu-
dents on campus use any form of protection 
during oral sex. 

Among the majority of students at Yale, 
HN itself remains unrecognized and unac-
knowledged. They half-follow the precautions 
that those who truly understand the risks and 
realities of this disease spend so much time try-
ing to teach. 


The day before my deadline for this 
piece, I found one of the envelopes 
waiting patiently in my mailbox. 
Someone had responded to one of my letters. 
I am a 26-year-old male graduate school 
(Ph.D.) srudent in the sciences. I regret that I 
won't be able to be forthcoming on many 
details and I'll explain why. 
I discovered I was HN-positive at Yale, in 
my first year of graduate school, two years 
ago. I was extremely distressed and confided 
only in my parents and two close friends. I 
evenrually told a professor who I was close to. 
While he was sympathetic, he strongly urged 
me to keep this a secret sinoe I seriously 
risked ruining the career I am preparing 
for .... I was reminded Yale is a small, closely 
knit community where rumors spread very 
quickly. Having my status disclosed would 
do me no good. I am very scared of being dis-
criminated against when I apply for teaching 
jobs (my prospective employers would know 
the Yale faculty writing my letters of recom-
mendation). 

I have been in exoellent health since I've 
tested. I am on a multi-drug regimen and my 
viral load is undetectable. thanks to protease 
inhibitors. I have to say the isolation I feel 
here is enormous, and things are bearable 
because I immerse myself in my work and 
because I am close to my family. I hope this 
helps you in any way. I am signing under a 
pseudonym (it feels srupid having to do this 
bur the risk is roo great). 

Yours, 
"Tom" 

So did this letter, in its simple sincerity, 
answer my questions? Or in looking for 
HIY, had I made myself one of us searching 
for a victimized thmz. 

For most Yalies, dealing with AIDS 
means making the epidemic an academic 
question, crowding Professor Novick's AIDS 
and Society lectures. But for the 0.5 percent, 
HN is still something only discussed with 
the closest of loved ones and best of friends, 
a solitary burden for the patients to carry. As 
my keys hung from the open mailbox, I read 
the letter over and over, absorbing the 
humanity of these handwritten words. laJ

The laws of Shomer Negiah, which Chavi also practices, seem to 
demand even more of her. In English, Shomer Negiah means "keeping 
the touch," and if one is strictly observant, touching a member of the 
opposite sex is forbidden until marriage. Its tenets of modesty even affecr 
the way a practicing member chooses to dress-Chavi will wear pants but 
not shorts. 

"There are women who won't wear pants. There are women who will 
~shorts but not shon-shorts and there are women who take it merely 
as a method of thinking about your selfhood and your relationship to 
other people in the world," she says. "To whatever extent, you try to 
make your physicality a precious thing, a rare thing." 

Is Yale a difficult place to practice her beliefs? Again, Chavi sees more 
than one side to this question. ''Yale is amazing for Jews and Yale is also 
very hard for Jews. It's hard to be observant here, but it's also one of the 
things I'm proudest o£ And I'm also very glad that I've done it because it 
gave my Yale experience a dimensionality that it wouldn't have had other-
wise." Although Chavi says that people are more curious than judgmental 
about her beliefs, she worries that many people do not see how the tenets 
ofShomer Negiah can mesh with the realities oflife in the 1990s. 

"The people we're talking about here are clearly people who go to a 
university, who can deal with things like Biblical criticism, who can deal 
with things like having condom ads," she says, speaking of herself and 
other devoudy religious students. "We can deal with a lot of things and 
we have a connecrion to religion that is not always traditional." 

For insrance, Chavi sees a dear link between the stringent laws of 
FEBRUARY 13, 1998 
Shomer Negiah and her feminism, noting that both Shomer Negiah and 
feminism reveal an intimate connection between a woman's body and her 
mind. "That is a connection that is often ignored," she says. "And I see a 
lot of women and also men who are harmed. They tend to forget that 
what they do with their bodies really does affecr their minds." For Chavi, 
keeping the touch is a day-to-day gesture of respecr for the mind as well 
as for the body. 

Chavi's comfon level at Yale seems to a great extent, to stem from her 
own ability to see things from multiple angles. She attributes this sensitiv-
ity to her membership in a community of people whose priorities match 
her own. Chavi says she's been lucky: "There are people who've had really 
shocking experiences and then there are people who've had really 
mediocre ones, and then there are people who've had really amazing 
ones-you know, what Yale's supposed to be all about: sharing of cul-
tures, sharing of ideas. That happens, and that's happened to me a lot." 

She also emphasizes that her Faith does not require her to proselytize. 
"I don't tell people how to act. If there are friends of mine who are in sup-
portive relationship and it's hard on them to remain abstinent I think that 
perhaps they should have sex. That's healthy. That's not conventional 
onhodoxy, but I'm a big believer in health of mind, soul, and body." 

Yale offers a wide range of health and counseling to suppon students' 
mental and physical well-being. In particular, Consent, 'Walden, and 
Pathways focus specifically on sexuality as it penains to homosexuality, 
sexual assault, harassment, AIDS, and STDs. Ar. the moment, however, 
there is no suppon or outreach group specifically for abstinent students.

vices to students, is one option for Yalies attempting to reconcile their

**Title: Yale's Religious Students: Navigating Faith and University Life (Continued)**
**Page number(s): 32-33**

religious beliefs with the university's social cli-
mate. Associate Chaplain Reverend Cynthia 
Terry mentions that sitting down to talk with 
someone, perhaps a counselor or other respect-
ed adult, can help clarify what a student really. 
wants or believes. 

"I would ask the srudent some questions 
about their beliefs: what their own personal val-
ues are, both about sex and about their reli-
gious traditions. Is there a high value placed on 
the practice of religious values, regardless of 
agreement with the belief? Is there an emphasis 
on making an informed decision based on per-
sonal values? Mostly, I would want to help a 
srudent feel that there really is a decision to be 
made either to have sex or not to have it. My 
approach is not to uphold a particular religious 
principle or teaching, but instead to help stu-
dents identify the values and principles by 
which they want to live their life." 

Of course, the prospect of talking about 
one's sex life with an adult can seem as difficult 
as one's initial concerns. When Sarah Oelker's 
boyfriend and friends challenged her religious 
beliefs during her freshman year, she found 
herself reluctant to speak with an authority fig-
ure about it. "I've never felt like broaching the 
subject," she says. "I guess I'm very afraid of 
just getting told flatly, 'No, you are expected to 
not participate in that activity and that activity 
is a great sin and you're in big trouble."' 

While Sarah does believe there are very 
good reasons to abstain from sex until mar-
riage, she says that at this point in her life these 
reasons are more practical than religious. "Sex 
adds a level of seriousness, especially if you've 
been raised to take it seriously. If you're going 
out with someone and you decide you're going 
to have sex with them, you become emotionally 
32 
attached," she says. "It's probably going to be 
emotionally easier for you if you don't." 

Sarah was raised in a Catholic household 
where she was expected to be abstinent. She 
even had trouble uttering the words for geni-
talia when she got involved with her first seri-
ous boyfriend during her freshman year. This 
relationship was the only one so far in her life 
that has involved sex. Ultimately, she says, it 
was a positive experience. 

"We started having more serious discus-
sions about having sex, and I developed the 
ability to say, 1\ll right, I am uncomfortable 
with ·this.' I was kind of timid in a lot of ways 
and had not dated in high school, and I 
remember being kind of afraid when I realized 
that here's this guy who wants to be involved 
with me. That kind of made me sit back and 
look at it and say 'Okay, what do I believe?"' 

According to Professor Susan Brandon, 
who teaches The Psychobiology of Sex, 
"unthoughtful" sexual behavior is defined as 
"outside of relationships and without the use of 
contraceptives or protection." In addition to 
being thoughtful about the commitment level 
of her partner and the necessary methods to 
avoid pregnancy and disease, Sarah needed to 
do some serious thinking about whether or not 
she believed pre-marital sex is a mortal sin. 

Stealing and lying were always very cut-
and-dry things that one simply was not sup-
posed to do, Sarah says. When it came to sex, 
however, the issue seemed less clear. Her 
boyfriend, who had been raised in a secular 
household and had no such stigmas attached to 
sex, actively challenged her belie&. A friend of 
Sarah's had spoken to a priest before who said 
that pre-marital sex was not intrinsically bad, 
but something you needed to think about and 
do responsibly. Sarah was strongly divided. 

"I was saying, I feel these urges and I'm 
being told that they're wrong and that's driving 
me up a wall. I feel like I'm not going to be sat-
isfied with the outcome either way. One way, 
I'm kind of fighting back a lot of things that I 
feel so strongly attracted to. And the other way, 
I feel like I'm deserting ideas and guidelines 
that I was raised with." 

Finally, Sarah chose to have sex. Although 
she says she is disturbed by how blindly she 
went into it, looking back on it she thinks she 
needed to see that an experience she had been 
so afraid of for so long was not necessarily 
goingJo be a horrible experience. 

Sarah does not recall worrying specifically 
about how having had sex was going to affect 
the fate of her soul. However, she is sometimes 
afraid to be frank with other people about her 
expenence. 

"The most trouble was the time my mom 
and I got on the topic during a lunch conversa-
tion. I was not willing to tell her I'd been sexu-
ally involved with someone. And she's lecturing 
me on how much of a mixed blessing birth 
control is. I can remember listening to her be 
negative about it and thinking I feel like crap 
" because this is kind of closing the barn door 
after the horse is stolen." 

Sarah worries that her conservative Christ-
ian friends will think less of her for having sex, 
and she is not always comfortable with being 
identified as someone who's "in the know." 
While talking to one such friend who had spe-
cific mechanical questions about sex, Sarah 
experienced an awkward moment. "She actual-
ly didn't completely understand what sex was. 
She asked, 'Does it really work like this?,' and 
gave me an example. And I said, yeah, it really 
works like that. And it was kind of creepy to 
me because she was a conservative Christian, 
and I had been raised Christian and she was 
coming to me as someone who knew." 

Although it was not an easy decision for 
her to make, Sarah believes her choice was the 
right one for her. She also says that, although 
she has not been going to church on a regular 
basis recently, she is still very interested in being 
a Catholic. "I can't say, 'Bless me Father I have 
sinned. I've had sex with this guy and I'm 
sorry.' I'm not sorry. That constirutes a prob-
lem." But she believes that the issue of whether 
you have sex or not isn't the main point of reli-
gion. It's about caring for other people. Sarah 
says that at the root of it, she is Catholic

Spend a night at a New Haven strip club, but don't be surprised 
when you turn out to be just another face in the crowd. 

My friends gripped the heads of the heart-shaped 
lollipops wiclt their teeth and withdrew them simulta-
neously from the stripper's G-string guarded crotch. 
Between the hanging clouds from the smoke machine, 
the specks of light dancing about the disco ball, and the raucous 
screams of our fellow audience members, they had no choice but to 
cross the line. 

All night the mood of this place-Cleopatra's all-nude juice bar, 
133 Hamilton Street, a five-minute drive from Yale's central campus-
had been molding us to the demands of the stripping milieu. When 
featured dancer Colette DuPree shimmied out onto the glass bottom 
stage at 2 a.m., dressed as a latex wet nurse, we definitively slipped into 
our new selves. Perhaps it was something besides the smoke and lights? 
Perhaps, but probably not. We had all smoked too many cigarettes, 
but surely none of us was drunk enough to justify dangling dollar bills 
from our teeth, clapping for each dancer in turn, watching then leer-
ing at the strippers. And what was our excuse when Ms. DuPree placed 
four small pails of fluorescent paint on the lip of the stage, handing us 
each a paintbrush? What made us so readily take them from her hand 
and paint curlicues and circles, pictures and words on her thighs and 
calves, her belly and breasts? The transition from voyeur to viewer, 
kitsch-monger to participant took only two hours. 

Later, I asked one of the friends who took the trip: what made you 
do it, what made you grab that lollipop with your teeth? 
"I had to," my friend said, "I had no choice. All the men in the 
club were screaming. We became pan of her act." 

At the time, two days earlier, I would have agreed that it was the 
only way out. Ms. DuPree, legs akimbo and balanced at the edge of 
the stage, would probably have lain spread-eagle for a half-hour wait-
ing for her chosen ones to withdraw her showstopping lollipops. Away 
from the club and its attendant atmosphere of carefully orchestrated 
seediness, another possibility occurred to me. "Well, why didn't you 
just grab it with your hand?" I asked. "That would have defused it." 
"You know," my friend replied, "I never thought of that." 

But as students at one of the top universities in the world, aren't we 
programmed to think? Yes, we party, we play, we kiss, we drink, but 
34 
this is not how we define ourselves. We are workers, doers, and 
thinkers most of all. Or are we? Something between midnight and 2 
a.m. had turned us into one of the crowd. I walked into the strip club 
worried that the group I had assembled for the trip-a gay man, a 
straight one, two women friends-would get in the way of having an 
authentic good time. I thought the five of us would never be able to let 
go of our Yaletime demeanors, our varying degrees of straight-laced 
straight-facedness and brassy flirtation, our minds. Alone perhaps I 
could avoid the feelings of guilt and embarrassment one might feel 
while cheering for naked women, but with four dose friends? Maybe 
we would whoop it up for the ladies and have an ironic good time, but 
I never suspected it would cease being a game. I never suspected we 
would be just another duster of faces in the throng of testosterone-dri-
ven men. 

I 
drove co Cleopatra's with the admonition of another friend floating 
in the back of my head. A few hours before I was scheduled co 
leave, I got a message that Nicky had called. Initially, I tried to 
assemble my team from a seasoned group of nudie bar veterans, and 
Nicky's name had been recommended by more than one friend. "I've 
done the strip club thing five times, so I'm far from an expert," my 
friend Chris wrote to me in an e-mail. "I do, however, have a sugges-
tion for you: Nicky. When I went to a strip club with Nicky and a 
bunch of guys she was the only one to get hit on-by the strippers. 
Although she has many elements, the strip club is definitely one of her 
better ones. Get her to go. It promises excitement." Through the 
grapevine, Nicky learned about my little field trip and she wanted to 
give me some tips to avoid misrepresenting the strip dub scene. Curi-
ous, I called back. 
"Hey Nicky," I said, "You called?" 
"I heard you're writing an article about strip clubs," she said. 
"Yeah, I am. I'm told you think I'm going to fuck it up." 
"It's not that. But it seems that every year all the Yale publications 
send our their writers to do a disbelieving story on strip clubs. 
Inevitably the writer writes about how boring it was, how little they 
were aroused ... " 
THE NEW jOURNAL 


--- Page 35 ---

"Don't worry, Nicky," I said. 
''I'm going to try and get aroused." 
"That's fine and good. I just 
wanted to give you a few hints." 
I was intrigued. "Like what." 
"The important thing to 
remember is that at a strip club 
you don't matter. When people go to the 
clubs for the first time they're often too self-conscious 
about who they are. They're afraid that they'll be noticed or that 
somehow they are going to embarrass themselves. The key is no one 
cares. The dancers have seen it all before. To them everyone in there is 
just another guy, just another pig, and none of them care what any of 
you want. No one gives a shit. Just have fun and blend in." 

C
ertainly it wouldn't be that easy. By nature, Yalies overintellec-
tualize. In the classroom discussion focuses on representations, 
models, theories, and almost never practice. We don't just read 
novels to enjoy them; we consider where they fit in, how they operate. 
Enjoyment-what we like--often goes undiscussed. Beyond that, part 
and parcel of the Yale lore passed from upperclassman to freshman 
every year is the idea that we are sexless, or at least neutered by our 
intellect. The undersexed Yalie is part of the Old Blue myth. 

When we each forked over $10 to the men at the door, when we 
took our seats at the back of the club, it seemed the magic of actually 
being there might never happen. We sat in one row, leaned against the 
wall, knowingly smirking and wondering just where we fit in among 
the 40-odd men in the clul>-marines on shoreleave, homeboys in 
hoodies, an essentially undifferentiated, but universally goofy, hyper-
masculine crop. Nicky was already there with her boyfriend in tow, 
ready to chastise. "I thought you'd never make it," she said. "We've 
been here for over an hour." 

Soon enough our group split up and we scattered ourselves 
throughout the room. Still near the back of the club, I took my place 
less than three feet from a man enjoying a lap dance-the stripper 
whispering suggestive babytalk in his ear, a smile on his face. I felt a 
barrier between us greater than the 
three feet of physical space that sepa-
rated him from me. I thought of this 
wall, then looked at the walls-televi-
sion screens playing video afrer video 
of swaggering hip hop, then cool 
Eurodisco, then Billy Ray Cyrus singing 
about his "Achy Breaky Heart." 

Unaroused but curious, I moved to 
the lip of the stage and sat between two of 
the marines. I held onto my notebook and 
kept writing and smoking cigarettes. An 
Asian girl announced as "Kia" took the stage, and the marine next to 
me growled, "Fuzzy underwear. I love it." Kia awkwardly removed her 
fuzzy briefs, and I noticed dog tags slapping against her bare chest, 
jostling juxtapositions in my mind I'd prefer not to make. An African 
American girl named Ebony followed Kia, then a caucasian girl, Dawn 
(my friend later dubbed her "the white trash fantasy"). The women 
were all caricatures-Dawn chewed her gum and wore a fiannel slip, 
Ebony unenthusiastically slapped her ass as a ritual to bring in tips, 
Kia had her dog tags. 

Half an hour later, my friends and I again lined up in a row, this 
time at the edge of the stage. Over the ceaseless music and the inter-
ruptions of the club's announcer-"In 15 minutes, our featured 
dancer, Colette DuPree. Come on boys, look alive!"-we discussed 
why some of the women were sexy and why some of them were not. 
"It's exoticization," one friend said. "Notice the guys just don't give it 
up the same way for the white girls. They've seen too much of that on 
television and in fashion magazines." 

Occasionally one of us would announce how little fun the club 
was, but over time these objections became less and less insistent .. I 
handed out dollars to my friends in an effort ro follow the rituals of 
the place. A few enthusiastically passed out their bills, but two of my 
friends waited. "They have to impress us fuse," one of them explained. 

At 2 a.m. we made our preparations to leave after one more song. 
Then Ms. DuPree came out, the latex wet nurse. Our jaws dropped,

Preparing for the special issue, we quickly realized that when it comes to sex, men and women seem to speak in different 
languages. So, we sent two of our editors, armed with tape recorders, to document typical discussions men and women have 
about sex and relationships when the opposite sex isn't around. To preserve the candid dialogue, we kept the participants 
anonymous. And, resisting the urge to draw conclusions, we will let the words stand on their own. 

Tim: Here's rhe thing about me. I never got any in high school. I 
kissed a girl sophomore year, and I had a girlfriend my junior 
year, and we hooked up a little, but it was pretty asexual. She 
even told me once-and this is when I knew I was going to break 
up with her-"1 like your look, you're kind of like that guy from 
the Black Crowes, asexual." I was like, "It's over." And then I 
kissed one girl after that. 

Greg: So the first time you had sex was at Yale? 

Tim: Yeah, and after that, things just fell into place. You kind of 
just hit your stride. And now my roommates think I'm just 
making up for lost time. 

Patrick: That's the same with me. I got even less than you in high 
school. I finally kissed a girl senior year, but never had a girlfriend 
or anything. 

Greg: I hooked up more in high school than now, but I only slept 
with one girl then. 

Tim: I could not have slept with a girl in high school, I was not ready. 

Patrick: Yeah, it's weird because now you're well-known as having 
good luck with the women. 

· 

Tim: The thing that happens with me is that I'll see a girl and I'll 
want her for a while quietly, and then somehow it just kind of 
works out. It's happened to me like three or four times. 

Patrick: It must be nice. 

Greg: Where was the first rime you had sex? Was it at Yale, like in 
a bunk bed? 

Tim: No, it was a single on Old Campus. It had to happen 
somewhere. I only had sex in my own bed at home once. 

FEBRUARY 13, 1998 

Karen: Faking is an easy topic, so let's talk about that. 

Linda: You fake? 

Karen: It's an easy topic because no, I don't. Never. 

Linda: You don't?! 

Amy: Yeah, me neither. Never. 

Melissa: Depends on the situation. 

Karen: You want to know why I never fake?. See, I never fake 
because if they're not doing it for me, they better know. I just 
think it's a waste of your time. Okay, lee's say it's the first time. 
It's hard to give instructions. but you can move your body in 
completely suggestive ways. 

Linda: I fake all the time. No problems with that. 

Karen: Are you kidding? Is it entertaining for you, like the acting 
pan of it? 

Linda: Yeah, it amuses me because, you know, it's like whatever-

Karen: -yes, you can be like, "They're so stupid!" 

Amy: It's run through my head before, but never. I couldn't. I feel 
guilty and also I feel like an orgasm is not the do-all end-all. I 
mean, I enjoy sex. Bottom fucking line. 

Linda: I feel guilty if I'm just silent. With some guys you don't 
even have time to fake it. It's like in, out, and you're like okay, all 
right, great. 

Karen: Yeah, it's like, "Clearly you don't know what you're doing." 

Linda: Right. It's like, "I'll lie here for you next time and we'll 
work on this." But with some men, I definitely feel like I get 
more excited when I hear them being excited. 

All: Yeah, definitely. 


Patrick: That was some of the best sex I've ever had. It was so 
great. We had to be really quiet. She had to sneak back up to the 
room she was staying in, because my parents would check. 

Tim: Having sex in my girlfriend's apartment was weird though, 
because it was a one-room apartment. We had sex on the fold-out 
couch and had to fold it back in, and then sit there having a 
conversation on that same couch an hour later with her parents. 
And one time I thought we left a condom on the floor. I just felt 
so guilty. ''I'm sorry Mr. So-and-So, I just fucked your daughter." 

Patrick: You know what's kind of weird? You might be getting 
kind of a reputation. 

Tim: Me? 

Patrick: I don't know, in a little way. I just said your name one 
time, and they were like, "Yeah, he's really good looking, but 
doesn't he hook up with anything that moves?" 

Tim: Ahhh! The reputation thing sucks. I kind of deserve it 
though. I thought I was discerning about who I hooked up with, 
but yeah, it's been getting kind of goofy. I don't care, I guess. I 
mean what does it matter, right? I don't hook up with anything 
that moves. I'm really careful. If she's a person who can handle a 
cheap thing, then it's like sure, but if it's someone I care about 
and really respect, I'm just not going to get" involved. Reputations 
suck. Who said it? 

Greg: Women talk. There's this network. 

Tim: So, how do you get them to leave Patrick? 

Greg: You kick them out at six in the morning! 

Patrick: I don't kick them out. I just-that's my problem, I don't 
get them to leave. I always kind of play along when they start 
doing the "I really want to hang out with you" t}ling, .and I'm 
like, "Yeah, me too." And then you kind of just say what you 
need to to get them to leave, and then you're like oh shit I think I 
kind of promised them something and they're going to get hurt. 

Tim: And then it's going to be a bunch of bumpy phone calls until 
they realize what you itwally-meant. That's how I feel. 

Patrick: Or at least, a weird "Hey, how's it going?" when you see 
them. But I don't understand. It seems like such a 19th century 
thing to be like, "Oh since we've slept together, that means I'm so 
committed to you." I've never understood why there should be 
such a connection in just one night. 

Greg: I feel that connection. That's why I get all hung up on one 
woman. 

Tim: You get hung up on the woman, not the sex. 

Greg: No, that's not quite it. They're inseperable, the woman as a 
person and the sex. I don't have sex with a lot of women, and the 
ones that I do, I then feel bound to. I've only slept with three 
women, so each one's a big deal ro me. 

Tim: I was just number 31 for this girl. 

Greg: Really?! 

Tim: And it scared the shit out of me, I was like, "What the fuck?" 

Patrick: How did this come up, how did she tell you? 

Tim: It just came up afterwards, you know during that pose-sex 
safe sex talk: "Now that we've actually had sex, what do you think 
of STDs?" I was like, "Dude, you're not even a double digit for 
me." I accidently made her feel bad about it. She was like "Well, 
thanks for making me feel like a slut." I didn't mean it in that 
way, just wow, that's a lot of people. 

Greg: Were you nervous because she'd been with so many men? 

Tim: No, not really. I'd ~efinitely given her signals that I thought 
she was cut'e. But it wasn't that romantic or that special, it's just 
not. Last week I went to visit this friend down at Georgetown, 
and she's just a good friend. We didn't sleep together, we kissed a 
little bit, but we just slept in the same bed and talked and stuff, 
and that was much nicer, the kind of thing I'd like to do again. 

Greg: What was this girl like, how was her body? 

Tim: She's hot, but like no, it's not about physical hotness, it's about 
warmth. With some girls you feel more warmth than with others. 

Greg: Sometimes it's about heat. 

Tim: No, heat is like exercise. 

Patrick: It's about heat, about chemistry, but heat is a false feeling. 

Tim: Yeah, you get like, "Uh-uh," but it only lasts for like an 
hour. 

Patrick: Yeah, it's all bullshit though. 

Tim: It's the warmth that keeps you returning to the same person. 
Because you're like, "Wow, you made me feel so good to hang out 
with yesterday that I want to hang out with you again." 

Greg: I suppose, but there has to be that hot base. 

Tim: You know what I realized? When I went down to visit this 
girl at Georgetown, I really felt myself just opening up a little bit. 
I think I'm this open, talkative guy. But the truth is that I'm 
really not that open with most peoele. I think ,J,he reason I'm so 
hung up on my ex-girlfriend and why it hur'tso ihucb when she 
said goodbye is because our personal lives were so integrated, and 
that's why I think she got claustrophobic. It was like having a best 
friend who you can have sex with. It's fucked up when that ends. 
That's why I'm on this spree of cheap flin~. Cheap flings suck, 
they're not that special. 

Patrick: No, it's not that. It's that you kind of always want what 
you don't have a little bit. 

Tim: Yeah, when I was with her, I was like, oooh that girl, I'm 
curious. And the best part is th apptbach, the'1ooks across a 
party, the "oh you want to come up to my room?" the flirting, 
getting drunk together, bumming cigarettes, and the walk to the 
bedroom, and maybe the first kiss, and maybe feeling the 
breasts-okay, it can go on for a while. 

Greg: And the wetness between their legs. 

Tim: Gross. 

Greg: You can't be like, "Gross," you've got to be into that. 

Tim: No, I've always been so freaked out by vaginas. I think it's 
because of my sisters-I'm scared of aU these feminine things. But 
I think that's part of my secret to relating to women. 

Greg: The fear of the vagina is his secret! 

Patrick: I have this question actually, especially because you don't 
hook up that much, do you feel any pressure to have this active 
sex life, that your sex life is somehow definitive of your manhood 
or anything? 

Greg: Not at all. I feel pretty much no pressure. There was a 
couple of months last year, when I felt so content, I didn't feel 
like I needed a woman. I was horny, I masturbated, but I never 
really looked at the women around me. Like I'd meet someone 
pretty and be flirting with her, but the possibility just didn't enter 
my mind. You've never felt that way, that it doesn't matter? 


Linda: For me it's a very aural type of thing. I don't feel guilty 
when I fake it. I've actually been asked if I've faked it and said no 
when I had. I lied, I lied. 

Amy: Are you serious? Now wait, here's a question. I feel like I 
couldn't even begin to fake it because they feel it. 

Linda: See, I think that's a lie because I don't think all guys know 
about that. 

~ 

Melissa: Well, you can contract your muscles on your own. 

Amy: Yeah, that's true. 

Linda: You can? 

Melissa: Yeah, ready? I can do it right now. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. 

Amy: Me, too. 

K_!fen· You did not jt.fst say that. Holy shit. 

.............. 

~elissa: It's called Kegel exercises. 

_ ' 

Amy: You can totally feel it. Ready contract. Evtiybody practice. 
Po it right now. 

~areJJ: I can feel it. What did you call it? 

~elfssa: Kegel exercises. They're exercises you cah do to tighten 
:your muscles and you can do that while you're having sex. You 
\:an do that to grip the member and you know.

Linda: Your knowledge never ceases to amaze me. The thing is, for 
long time I didn't know whether I was having 
orgasm or not. 

In-chi!'heginnhtgyou"Te likew:wthat'tt?' Did 1 just have one? 

Melissa: Yeah, but then when you do have one, you just know. 

Amy: Then you realize you've never had one before. 

Linda: When I have an orgasm it starts with this tingle in my toes. 

Amy: It starts in the feet. 

Melissa: That's when you hit the point of no return. 

Karen: Do you all squirm? I won't stay in one place, especially if 
I'm on a futon. I'll just walk down the futon. I've literally been 
told to stay still before because I just keep going. I just love it. It 
makes my body jerk in ways I obviously can't control. 

Linda: Do you scream or do you breathe heavily? 

Karen: I don't scream. 

Amy: I breathe heavily. 

Linda: I think I grip arms. 

Amy and Melissa: Yeah, so do I. 

Linda: It's kind of like, "If you leave I will kill you." 

Karen: I totally grip. 

Karen: I don't give blow jobs on the first hook up. They could go 
down on me 800 times and it's so obvious that they want one but 
I hate giving them. That's all there is too it. 

Melissa: I disagree. I love giving them. 

Karen: What?! 

Melissa: If I'm with someone I find it very intimate. It turns me on. 

Linda: I have issues with taking my pants off and letting that 
person make me happy. It's a very protective sort of thing. Like, if 
I let you excite me then I will be attached to you. 

Karen: Yeah. 

Amy: Also, oral sex is more intimate than sex. 

Karen: It's also very hands on. 

Linda: It's also very one-sided at the time i:hat it's happening. 

Karen: Well, not necessarily. Meanwhile, that is fun. 

Melissa: That is fun. But sometimes it's just too hard to 
concentrate. You're like, "Oh my god, what is going on?" You feel 
like your technique is breaking down because you can't focus. 

Linda: Do you have technique? 

Melissa: Yeah, de-finitely. I have a technique. 

Karen: There's a definite pattern. 

Melissa: I'll just put in a note as a student AIDS educator that 
you really shouldn't swallow. Because there is a risk associated 
with getting diseases through oral sex. 

Amy: Really? 

Melissa: Yeah. You can completely reduce your risk by not 
swallowing. If you don't let any semen in your mouth you really 
reduce your risk. 

Linda: What if you spit? 

Melissa: That's better than swallowing. But if you don't let it into 
your mouth at all, that's the best. You can do the old "just give 
me a holler when you're about to you know." 

Karen: I think in general you can tell. 

Linda: You can feel a little vein pulse and you know it's about to 
happen. Meanwhile, it doesn't taste good. Let's just put that out 
on the table now. 

Amy: Yeah, and it's a respect. issue too. If you're not in a serious 
relationship and they expect you to swallow, it's like a violation. 

Linda: If they don't inform me or even make a motion to pull 
away, that makes me angry because then it's in your mouth. 
There's no place to spit it and it's like, "Now what do you expect 
me to do?" That's not respecting me. 

Amy: Exactly. 

Linda: And then there's the whole after-oral-sex-kiss thing. Kiss or no? 

Amy: Yes. Kiss. 

Melissa: Yes. 

Linda: It's like an intimate way of saying that was okay and nice. 

Melissa: Hey, have you guys ever tried any food products? 

Karen: Marshmallow. 

Melissa: Whipped cream. 

Karen: Nutella. That's totally good. 

Amy: I want to try Hershey's syrup. 

Karen: Marshmallows were actuaJly extremely disgusting but 
extremely incredible. You can put them pretty much anywhere 
and everywhere. Think taffy. 

Karen: You know what else? I love right before you hook-up. 

Linda: Why? Because you've got that feeling that you're going to 
hook up with someone? 

Karen: Yeah, anA you also know that you're good. It's like you can 
stand there and say ro him ~~your mind, "Yeah buddy, you don't 
even know whauou're atlout to deal with.." The best was in the 
middle someoQ_,e once'said, "Holy shit." 

Linda: I got-an "I'm melting." That was grear. 

Karen: First night: seven'posit1ons. 

Lillila: What?!'My &rsc:time I could only be on top because it hurt 
too much an~Chtr way. 

' 

Karen: Mine didn't.ht.trrat all. 

Melissa: Jlosr my virginity in my own bedroom. 

Linda: Have you ever done it in your parents' bed? 

Melissa: Yeah, I've done it there. 

Karen: Okay, let's talk about positions. 

Linda: Top is good but after a while your legs start to fucking hurt.

**O, What a Tangled Web ...**
**Author: Dan Kellum**
**Page number(s): 42**

O, What a Tangled Web ... 
He kissed me, then he kissed this other guy who I kissed last year. I don't kiss 
a lot of people. Maybe he tloes, but that's not the issue. 
It's more complex than that. I met him last year when he was going 
out with this guy, David, who he later broke up with. Then he hooked 
up with the boy that David would go out with the next semester, the 
boy who would be the rebound for the boy I broke up with early that 
January. But again that's only one side of the story, because he also 
hooked up with a boy whom I had dated .roonths before, but then so clid 
David, and so did the boy I broke up witli in January. 
These relationships, wh"en thought of abstractly-only a series of 
hes-seem elegant in the way they follow after each other, like beads 
strung on a necklace. But the effect is less attractive when connected to a 
list of names, a catalogue of faces that keep popping up at the corner of 
York and Elm, then at a party you clidn't really feel like going to anyway. 
So many of these relationships amount to only glances, a kiss in a crowd-
ed room, a phone number scribbled into a matchbook. .. The romantic 
interests of some of the gay men I know have ambulated within such 
tight constraints that constructing a map of their liaisons would be con-
fusing, even daunting, such a project ending with a spider's web of for-
mer hookups, traded ex-boyfriends. 
This web speaks to the fact that though there is not one unified gay 
community at Yale, there are networks of friends that date, even if it 
means they must impose on old loyalties. Recently, a graduate student I 
dated in the fall asked a friend of mine on a date. The graduate student 
had not been that special to me. I guess it didn't matter. But it was scill 
strange, because this friend had dated or hooked up with many of the 
same people I had in the past. He asked me for informacion about the 
grad student: he wanted to know if he was cool, why it had ended 
between him and me, whether he should consider going out with him, 
never voicing any concern as to how invasive his interest might..have 
been. At the time I clidn't think much of it either, because there are so 
few gay men at Yale, so few that I could potentially be interested in. But 
the more I think about these sorts of occurrences, the more I think 
about how they devalue the meaning of these relationships. How can a 
hook up even potentially mean anything when it is so weighted with his-
torical implication? Especially among friends who gossip, how can inti-
macy be attained in the midst of so much shared information? 
If you aren't thinking seriously about dating non-Yalies in New 
Haven, then you have to keep turning over the known possibilities, the 
names and faces of classmates you know to be gay. If you want to date a 
Yale man you are confronted, then, with a limited-so small its mem-
bers seem achingly countable-pool of possible dates. You meet some-
one, you might think he's attractive, then you find out he's gay, then you 
think about him again. This return, this reconsideration, is important. 
In this situation the possibility of something turns into the something 
itself. the person you might not have considered suddenly become the 
person you leave a party with. It's an enabling compromise--"You're 
here. You're queer. I'll get used to it." -but maybe it will tum into some-
thing amazing, and maybe it's okay that you hooked up with him last 
year and you both agreed that it wasn't working out. 
I'w seen him around for the last couple ofyears. I knew he was gay. Now I'm 
rta!Ly into him. What tlo you think about him?. 
A friend said this to me at a party not long ago. He was revisiting his 
catalog of faces. Maybe the first rime he'd seen this other guy he felt the 
sparks that people talk about. Maybe my friend was dating someone else

then. Or maybe something changed about the boy in question. Maybe 
the boy had a new haircut or his conversation suddenly proved com-
pelling, or maybe the boy had put a note in my friend's bookbag, some-
thing to the effect of, "I had an amazing time talking to you last week-
end, maybe we could continue that conversation next Wednesday?" 
Maybe that bowled him over. Or maybe sensing the boundary of the 
possible reigned my friend in, made him consider what he had previous-
ly considered only in passing. 

Attractiveness in the gay community can be calculated much like a 
mathematical proof. Person X is attractive because Person X, Y, and Z 
are openly gay, and if we construct a relationship where X, Y, and Z, are 
compared, X wins. Person X is attractive because maybe X, Y, and Z are 
all there is right now. And even if person X isn't the ideal person to satis-
ry this equation, he's still person X, and he's attractive even if less than 
amazing in other respects, and then too, he's gay and both he and you 
know it. So that's one thing. 

At least there is that one important thing. 

The pairs of kvm in Shaktsptart's A Midsummer Night's Dream smn 
inttrchangeabk to rrr.any readers. As if Helma might have mded up with 
Lysarukr and Htrmia with Dmutrius insttad of viet vma. It's only impor-
t4nt that thty marry in tht md. It only matte'S that tvtrything mds happily, 
but, thm, that's sort of like college. It's not who you're hooking up with that 
mattn"s, just that you're hooking up. 

A TA told me that. So maybe this dosed-circuit of hook-ups is more 
a condition of college, of being at the tail-end of adolescence, than of 
being gay in particular. Since any college community is a confined one, 
and since the gay community is a small part of that confined communi-
ty, and since loosely-formulated groups of friends are even smaller than > 
::l 
that, settling is bound to happen to a certain degree. The thought, "I ~ 
haven't hooked up in a year," becomes ammunition against any doubts :; 
you might have about the person you're flirting with while standing near 
~: 
the pony keg. Everywhere you go there are the same people, the same ~ 
names, their interest in one another budding or wilting like so many list-
~ 
less flowers, motivated by tropisms rather than any true desire. Which is 
not to say that these aren't valid attractions, just that the exciting, all-
encompassing attractions one might expect to find exist in a pervasively ~ 
disinterested setting, couched in an historically intertwined hook-up ~ 
narrative. 
But is this situation actualiy a probkm? Should it bothtr those invoivt:d? 
This is the question I pose to myself. These friends who hook up with 
one another in spite of what has happened before, are they hurt by their 
own history? Does this siruation effect pain in the lives of those involved? 
I'm not really sure that it does. The situation doesn't seem to cause any real 
headaches, merely rurious bemusement. This messy configuration of 
entanglements isn't intrinsically a bad thing, because for the most part this 
history is cloaked in an understanding of adversity and a quiet respect for 
one another. And, though messy, these entanglements nonetheless contain 
something worth preserving. Because on the sidewalk in fiont of the 
Women's Center, or in line for packages at the post office they allow for it 
to happen. Despite all the intertwining associations, the convoluted mess 
of history, these links allow the earth-shattering something erstwhile 
recounted by sonneteers to happen between twO men.

**Title: Mustering the Nerve**
**Author: Gabriel Snyder**
**Page number(s): 44-45**

Thinking About Thinking About Sex 
by Gabriel Snyder 
Nerve Magazine (http:/ ;www.nervemag.com) 

NUKE RESPECTABLE SITES ON THE 
Internet, Nerve immediately con-
fronts the browser with a stern warn-
ing, "Nerve is a magazine of daring nude pho-
tography and brash writing about sex and 
gender." The notice hangs over the site like a 
faux "DANGER" sign on a wooden rollercoast- · 
er; the caution serves to make you feel like 
what you are doing is, well, a bit crazy- no 
matter how much you are counting on the 
tracks to hold up and the ride operators to 
know how to make the ride as utterly free of 
danger as possible. What you have come for is 
a careful simulation of exactly what you want 
to avoid. 

Nerve has dubbed itself "literate smut." 
The irony is intentional, but only partially. 
For a sexual culture like the one at Yale, where 
sex is easily politicized, theorized, and ana-
lyzed in seminars and senior essays, where per-
sonal feelings on sex are rarely acknowledged 
openly, where people are much more comfort-
able with the theory of sex than its practice, 
Nerve attempts to strike that perfeft balance 
between reason and passion, intellect and 
desire. Nerve winks at those of us who see 
ourselves as too smart to bow to the level of 
smut and agrees not to insult our intelligence 
with prurient photos and stories-all the time 
acknowledging that that's what we came for in 
the first place. 

But Nerve is not simply a high-brow ver-
sion of the corner porn shop. The purpose of 
dirty movies or Hustkr magazine is to make a 
person think about having sex. The fantasy 
that Nerve presents is not of indulging in sex, 
but rather it is the fantasy of being someone 
who fantasizes about indulging in sex. 

SINCE THE SITE WAS U.UNCHED u.sT JUNE, 
Nerve has received warm receptions from the 
mainstream media which has been attracted 
more to essays by Nerve's well-known contrib-
utors (Norman Mailer, Jocelyn Elders, and 
Quentin Crisp, to name a few) than to any of 
the site's racier selections. And the site does 
not Jack for interesting reads, whether it be an 
account by a male prostitute, a ~ieee about 
selling sex toys in homes · (a la ~->Tupperware 
parties), or porn king AI Gol~stejn:s t~ 'of the 
beginnings of Screw . . With its ·£~anguished 
writers and photographers, Nerve aspires to 
join the pantheon of intelligent web sites, dis-
played dearly by the site's two main advertis-
ers: Feed and Salon-the two titans, so to 
speak, of on-line culture. 

Nerve's two founders, Rufus Griscom and 
Genevieve Field, cenainly have the credentials 
to run a hip but smart new media venture. 
They are both refugees from the trenches of 
the New York literary world. Griscom even 
has the good taste to have graduated from an 
Ivy League school. But perhaps the most 
imponant qualification to run a site such as 
Nerve that Field and Griscom hold is that the 
two have been lovers for the last two years. 
On the site, they take on the personas of two 
sex-crazed teenagers: "We are a couple of gar-
den-variety sex enthusiasts, much like the rest 
of you mammals. On a good night we call out 
to the heavens and thrash abour like hooked 
bass, clamoring after those precious few sec-
onds of blindness." 

The content Nerve offers, though, makes 
all the rancor about smutty high culture seem 
a little silly. The photographs are as shocking 
as an art school crit, and the fiction is as dar-
ing as a college literary magazine. Everything 
is "good," to be sure, but with the mission of 
striking the difficult tone of literate smut, the 
works are warped into something they 
wouldn't normally be. Barbara Vaughn tries to 
capture the beauty of the nude form by taking 
photos of herself naked outdoors on rocks and 
in forests. Field writes of Vaughn's work, "Her 
greatest challenge .. .is to avoid the deliberate 
sexuality that the viewer exp<its to find in 
images of the nude form." Vaughn can be con-
fident that the challenge has been overcome. 
But, in the context of Nerve, Vaughn's pictures 
don't seem very smart {or very smutty). With 
the site's insistence that it means to turn its 
users on, the viewer who wants to appreciate 
Vaughn's photos is reduced to a 12-year-old 
boy snickering at the paintings by Titian by 
noting that, after all, they are of naked women. 

Elsewhere on the site, Nerve's attempts to 
be smutty fall ridiculously flat. For example, in 
the first installment of Jack Murnighan's col-
umn titled "Naughty Bits," he promises, 
"Every week I will be culling a particularly de-
gant or juicy moment from the last three thou-
sand years of fiction and poetry for your edifi-
cation and arousal." One can imagine excerpts 
from D.H. Lawrence or the Kama Sutra filling 
the space, but Murnighan's choice is the story 
of Paolo and Francesca from Dante's Inferno. 
Of such staid lines as, " ... this one, I Who 
from me will never be taken, I Kissed me, his 
body 
all 
trembling, 
on 
the 
mouth," 
Murnighan coos like an eighth-grade English 
teacher, "Even in the Middle Ages they knew 
how to appreciate the naughty bits!" 

When Nerve does come dose to making 
us blush-as in Philip Martin's shott story, 
"The Eavesdropper" - the layers of irony turn 
the author into a fool. With "The Eavesdrop-
per" Marcin seems to be ashamed to be stoop-
ing so low. His account of a failed marri~ 
interspersed with a blow-by-blow description 
THE NEw joURNAL 

of the couple's first time having sex-is not 
very far removed from a Penthouse letter. But 
with tips like this dialogu;; we know this isn't 
what he meant to do at all: 

"Do you want to fuck me?" She breathed. 
"More than anything in the world." 
"You want to fuck me hard?" 
"I want to fuck your brains out." 
She laughed. 
"Oh Will, that's not so original." 
"No, it's not." 

We can't help from laughing either. The edi~ 
tors and writers know all too well that the 
smutry and the literate have nothing to do 
with each other, and the juxtaposition of the 
rwo is ludicrous to the point of being funny. 
We can read "The Eavesdropper" as if it were 
pornography, but only if we ignore Martin's 
attempts at being original through his uno rig~ 
inality. And if we want to appreciate it as liter~ 
ature, we must rationalize the sexuality away 
until it disappears. 

This absurd juxtaposition occurs again 
and again on Nerve. In a photograph by 
Charles Gatewood, we see a naked woman 
lying on a waterbed, legs spread toward the 
camera. She is masturbating, with one hand 
in her crotch and the other gripping at a 
breast. Surrounding her are 16 fashionable 
New York gallery~goers, pensively analyzing 
the performance artist's every moan. In the 
context of the drag queens and dominatrixes at 
discos and street festivals that make up the rest 
of his photo essay, Gatewood is clearly poking 
fun at such staid intellectuals. But it is bruising 
commentary on Nerve's project, as well. Cro~ 
ping out the gathered crowd of high-brows, he 
would have an image that he could sell to any 
porn magazine, but confronted with such a 
sexual display, the only reaction the culturally 
informed can muster is quiet study. 

The unmaking of Nerve is found in the 
site's statement of intent, tided with mock 
indignation, "What Are We Thinking? (An 
Apologia)," where Griscom and Field 
unwillingly stumble upon their own failings. 
They complain that smut trying to pass as 
art does not understand, "that once our 
desire reaches a certain clip, attempts at 
artistry become annoying obstacles in the 
path of the nouns and verbs (or precious 
pixels) that deliver the goods."

SEX. THE WORD IS ALL SIBILANCE. IT SOUNDS 
like it feels. Salacious: This word, too, seems 
to hiss at us. It's as if at the level of some deep, 
ancient structure of the brain, language and 
libido coalesce. The compulsion to write melds 
with the subconscious drive to copulate. 
This drive ·may lead to obsession, but purport-
edly, Yalies don't have much sex. What better way to displace our 
desire than to write about it? It seems to be a trend that Yalies 
replace actually acting passionately with writing passionately. 
Unfortunately, in the midst of all this huffing and puffing, 
writing about sex tends to be lamentably bad. It's not surprising 
really. Sex is truly one of the most difficult things to write about, 
and those Yalies who dare to hazard it deserve a medal of valor if 
not a medal for the product of that valor. In Elizabeth Michaud's 
(CC '77) poem "Passion by Permit" recently reprinted in Zirkus, 
one Yalie lays it all on the line: "This vehicle of love I Needs a little 
affection I Oh baby, won't you honk I In my direction?" 

Aware that bad sex writing is not confined to Yale literary mag-
azines, trashy romance novels, and sci-fi thrillers, The Lomkm Lit-
erary Review gives a prize each year to passages about sex from seri-
'ous fiction that are "embarrassed, and embarrassing." This little 
gem comes from Philip Kerr's 1995 prize-winning novel Gridiron: 
"His tremulous thumbs gathered the elastic waist of her panties 
and plucked them over the twin gold domes of her behind and up 
Qi over the suspended sentences and Sobraine filter tips of her stock-
~ ing tips." What the hell is he talking about? 

This passage appears in Ben Okri's Booker Prize winning Dan-
~ gerous Lov~ "Then, as if in a new ritual in which they knew their 
e exact role, they stood up as one. They clung to one another. 
(!: "i Omoro breathed in the rich aroma of her hair oils. Then he felt his 
~ way down her back with both hands. And he stopped at the rotun-
~ dity of her backside. After that, things happened rather fast." I'm 
·~ not sure Okri's readers were all too turned on by "the rotundity of 
~ her backside." Nor, I surmise, were they all too impressed with the 
~ unabashed evasive maneuvers at the end of the passage. 

But Yale writers are not necessarily embarrassed about writing 
about sex. Many of us seem to have quite the 
opposite problem: shamelessness. After all bound-
aries are crossed, we're left with nothing ~o transgress. 
Gene Huang's (SM '98) poem "3 a.m. Sunday Morn-
ing" appeared in Aurora this year. At first it attempts 
subtlety, and ta,kes the indirect approach: "I remember the 
nights of insomnia all too well, the obvious cure I being that which 
had forced sleep before, waving me under I its arm like a fireman 
shepherding me though smoke, or a magician I vanishing me as his 
act." In the next stanza, however, all restraint is thrown to the 
wind: "We learn we are men by the bunching of skin I and the for-
mation of fist ... " Ugh. Perhaps some fresh air would have helped 
fight off this bout of sleeplessness. 

Ever since Norman Mailer and friends opened up the flood-
gates in the 1960s, discretion has given way to insanely detailed 
epic sex scenes, more akin to the instruction manual of a new hi-fi 
stereo system than a description of people making love. Sex became 
nothing more than a series of actions, painstakingly noted. 

Of course, forthrightness is a virtue, and candor has its place. 
Take, for example, Chris Schmidt's (SM '97) inspired Yak Herald 
review of everyone's favorite cinematic social commentary, Show-
girls: "Tits! Tits! Tits! Big tits, buff tits, bouncy tits, and, of course, 
'nice tits.' If you've been lacking your requisite mammary fix, 
there's enough here to last you months." The. cynicism of this film 
critique reminds us of what happens when sex is no longer about 
people but rather about things. The mechanics of sex are quite sim-
ple, and nothing new or interesting can come out of hashing them 
out once again. It's the psychological baggage that comes along that 
can be illuminating: the yearning, the guilt, the vulnerability, the 
rage, the submission. At the same time, when sex scenes are 
wrought with fury and emotion, they run the risk of being embar-
rassingly cliche. 

Somehow, we have to find the right b;llance. Yale writers can be 
adventurous and imaginative without spoiling all the fun by 
spelling everything out. Arriving at this balance is no doubt a task 
of Herculean proportions. By the looks of it, though, there is no 
sign that Yalies will stop trying.
