and we are supplying more," Yale Coordinator 
of Health Education Sally Rinaldi (MPH '82) 
says. "We find people are certainly more edu-
cated and knowledgable these days. Whether 
that translates into practice, I don't know." 
At the AIDS Resource and Counseling 
Center, Rinaldi directs the public education 
that Yale students receive about AIDS. "We 
tun the safer sex talks for freshmen in the fall; 
we do presentations for fraternities, for cultural 
houses," she explains. Her elementary school 
" teacher demeanor contraSts with a cluttered 
office decorated with condoms, books on eat-
ing disorders, and pamphlet upon pamphlet 
about HIY. Since corning to campus in 1986, 
Rinaldi has been a pioneer of AIDS education 
at Yale. For years she ran voluntaCy programs 
single-handedly, setting up shop in Commons 
with movies on safe sex. 
The university itself has been slow to recog-
nize the need for greater AIDS awareness. Only 
in 1993, after years of requests from Rinaldi; 
did the administration finally sanction manda-
tory safer-sex presentations. 
The often-ridiculed safer-sex meetings is 
the only time many undergraduates ever face 
the issues of HIY. And in that one hour, the 
messages can get lost amongst the spermicide, 
the dental dams, and the dildos. ''You hope 
that students will retain the informacion we tell 
them at the meetings, but that's often an unre-
alistic expectation," AIDS educator Lauren 
Anderson (MC '99) admits. Other educators 
say students were surprised to see a poster cam-
paign advertising the chance of HN infection 
through oral sex, though the risk had been 
explained to every student at the meetings. 


When students use protection, HN is 
rarely the motivation. "Pregnancy and the 
other STDs-that's the majority of reasons 
people use condoms," Rachel Germany (ES 
'99) says. Cathy Choy (TO '98), an AIDS edu-
cator, sees similar attitudes. "I hear it a lot," 
Choy says. "'I'm on the pill. I don't need to use 
a condom."' 

"Whether or not students want to think 
about what they are protecting themselves 
from, they are using protection," Shannon 
Morrison says. But, he admits that few stu-
dents on campus use any form of protection 
during oral sex. 

Among the majority of students at Yale, 
HN itself remains unrecognized and unac-
knowledged. They half-follow the precautions 
that those who truly understand the risks and 
realities of this disease spend so much time try-
ing to teach. 


The day before my deadline for this 
piece, I found one of the envelopes 
waiting patiently in my mailbox. 
Someone had responded to one of my letters. 
I am a 26-year-old male graduate school 
(Ph.D.) srudent in the sciences. I regret that I 
won't be able to be forthcoming on many 
details and I'll explain why. 
I discovered I was HN-positive at Yale, in 
my first year of graduate school, two years 
ago. I was extremely distressed and confided 
only in my parents and two close friends. I 
evenrually told a professor who I was close to. 
While he was sympathetic, he strongly urged 
me to keep this a secret sinoe I seriously 
risked ruining the career I am preparing 
for .... I was reminded Yale is a small, closely 
knit community where rumors spread very 
quickly. Having my status disclosed would 
do me no good. I am very scared of being dis-
criminated against when I apply for teaching 
jobs (my prospective employers would know 
the Yale faculty writing my letters of recom-
mendation). 

I have been in exoellent health since I've 
tested. I am on a multi-drug regimen and my 
viral load is undetectable. thanks to protease 
inhibitors. I have to say the isolation I feel 
here is enormous, and things are bearable 
because I immerse myself in my work and 
because I am close to my family. I hope this 
helps you in any way. I am signing under a 
pseudonym (it feels srupid having to do this 
bur the risk is roo great). 

Yours, 
"Tom" 

So did this letter, in its simple sincerity, 
answer my questions? Or in looking for 
HIY, had I made myself one of us searching 
for a victimized thmz. 

For most Yalies, dealing with AIDS 
means making the epidemic an academic 
question, crowding Professor Novick's AIDS 
and Society lectures. But for the 0.5 percent, 
HN is still something only discussed with 
the closest of loved ones and best of friends, 
a solitary burden for the patients to carry. As 
my keys hung from the open mailbox, I read 
the letter over and over, absorbing the 
humanity of these handwritten words. laJ
