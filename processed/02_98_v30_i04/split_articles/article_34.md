SEX. THE WORD IS ALL SIBILANCE. IT SOUNDS 
like it feels. Salacious: This word, too, seems 
to hiss at us. It's as if at the level of some deep, 
ancient structure of the brain, language and 
libido coalesce. The compulsion to write melds 
with the subconscious drive to copulate. 
This drive ·may lead to obsession, but purport-
edly, Yalies don't have much sex. What better way to displace our 
desire than to write about it? It seems to be a trend that Yalies 
replace actually acting passionately with writing passionately. 
Unfortunately, in the midst of all this huffing and puffing, 
writing about sex tends to be lamentably bad. It's not surprising 
really. Sex is truly one of the most difficult things to write about, 
and those Yalies who dare to hazard it deserve a medal of valor if 
not a medal for the product of that valor. In Elizabeth Michaud's 
(CC '77) poem "Passion by Permit" recently reprinted in Zirkus, 
one Yalie lays it all on the line: "This vehicle of love I Needs a little 
affection I Oh baby, won't you honk I In my direction?" 

Aware that bad sex writing is not confined to Yale literary mag-
azines, trashy romance novels, and sci-fi thrillers, The Lomkm Lit-
erary Review gives a prize each year to passages about sex from seri-
'ous fiction that are "embarrassed, and embarrassing." This little 
gem comes from Philip Kerr's 1995 prize-winning novel Gridiron: 
"His tremulous thumbs gathered the elastic waist of her panties 
and plucked them over the twin gold domes of her behind and up 
Qi over the suspended sentences and Sobraine filter tips of her stock-
~ ing tips." What the hell is he talking about? 

This passage appears in Ben Okri's Booker Prize winning Dan-
~ gerous Lov~ "Then, as if in a new ritual in which they knew their 
e exact role, they stood up as one. They clung to one another. 
(!: "i Omoro breathed in the rich aroma of her hair oils. Then he felt his 
~ way down her back with both hands. And he stopped at the rotun-
~ dity of her backside. After that, things happened rather fast." I'm 
·~ not sure Okri's readers were all too turned on by "the rotundity of 
~ her backside." Nor, I surmise, were they all too impressed with the 
~ unabashed evasive maneuvers at the end of the passage. 

But Yale writers are not necessarily embarrassed about writing 
about sex. Many of us seem to have quite the 
opposite problem: shamelessness. After all bound-
aries are crossed, we're left with nothing ~o transgress. 
Gene Huang's (SM '98) poem "3 a.m. Sunday Morn-
ing" appeared in Aurora this year. At first it attempts 
subtlety, and ta,kes the indirect approach: "I remember the 
nights of insomnia all too well, the obvious cure I being that which 
had forced sleep before, waving me under I its arm like a fireman 
shepherding me though smoke, or a magician I vanishing me as his 
act." In the next stanza, however, all restraint is thrown to the 
wind: "We learn we are men by the bunching of skin I and the for-
mation of fist ... " Ugh. Perhaps some fresh air would have helped 
fight off this bout of sleeplessness. 

Ever since Norman Mailer and friends opened up the flood-
gates in the 1960s, discretion has given way to insanely detailed 
epic sex scenes, more akin to the instruction manual of a new hi-fi 
stereo system than a description of people making love. Sex became 
nothing more than a series of actions, painstakingly noted. 

Of course, forthrightness is a virtue, and candor has its place. 
Take, for example, Chris Schmidt's (SM '97) inspired Yak Herald 
review of everyone's favorite cinematic social commentary, Show-
girls: "Tits! Tits! Tits! Big tits, buff tits, bouncy tits, and, of course, 
'nice tits.' If you've been lacking your requisite mammary fix, 
there's enough here to last you months." The. cynicism of this film 
critique reminds us of what happens when sex is no longer about 
people but rather about things. The mechanics of sex are quite sim-
ple, and nothing new or interesting can come out of hashing them 
out once again. It's the psychological baggage that comes along that 
can be illuminating: the yearning, the guilt, the vulnerability, the 
rage, the submission. At the same time, when sex scenes are 
wrought with fury and emotion, they run the risk of being embar-
rassingly cliche. 

Somehow, we have to find the right b;llance. Yale writers can be 
adventurous and imaginative without spoiling all the fun by 
spelling everything out. Arriving at this balance is no doubt a task 
of Herculean proportions. By the looks of it, though, there is no 
sign that Yalies will stop trying.
