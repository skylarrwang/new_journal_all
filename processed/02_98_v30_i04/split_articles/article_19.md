EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
A student sits in a waiting room at YUHS, contemplating the weekend's events and her forgotten diaphragm.  She plans to call YUHS for the morning-after pill, still within the 72-hour window.  The pregnant woman beside her embodies the student's fears.


Dr. Joann Knudson, Chief of OB/GYN at YUHS, explains that the morning-after pill, a higher dose of standard birth control pills, prevents implantation of a fertilized egg.  She emphasizes it's not an abortion pill and explains its mechanism.


However, Knudson omits the emotional side effects—isolation, depression, and anxiety—reported by many women who have taken the pill.  She attributes such feelings to a lack of support, dismissing potential psychological ramifications.


Kim, a student who took the morning after pill, recounts her experience, which differed greatly from Knudson's description.  For Kim, the pill didn't bring relief but instead induced anxiety about sex and ultimately contributed to the breakup with her boyfriend.


Leroy, whose girlfriend also took the morning-after pill after a condom malfunction, describes his feelings of stupidity and carelessness.  Despite their careful planning, the failure of contraception brought home the reality of the possibility of pregnancy. The experience led to a reevaluation of their contraceptive practices.


Kim's experience was far from the simple relief Knudson described; the waiting period brought anxiety and contemplation of serious decisions.  The experience led her to adopt a more cautious approach to contraception.
