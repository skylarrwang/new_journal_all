EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Malerie Marder (ART '98} makes photographs of people in the nude. But are they 
naked? Starkly lit and shot in one-hour motels, these pictures reveal the internal lives 
of friends and strangers in a way that puts their most private thoughts on display. The 
selection printed here-less risque examples of her work than the group as a whole-
let us see how clothing hides and protects more than just the flesh. These pictures let 
the viewer see the most vulnerable of human moments, instants of awkwardness and 
ecstasy, uncertainty and fulfillment.
