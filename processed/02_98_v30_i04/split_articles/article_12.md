EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
On November 20, 1997 a female Yale student filed a police report alleging that two Yale juniors had sexually assaulted her. The matter remained private until two weeks ago, when the Yak Daily News ran a story headlined "Two Yale Juniors Investigated for Sexual Assault." The Daily included many of the details alleged in the police report. But, despite the fact that the accused students, were identified in the police report, the Daily chose not to include their names. 

Sex crimes are, by their nature, private. And, unfortunately, sex crimes also make for great news copy. When faced with the choice between running the third installment of an eight-part series on the development of the Broadway strip and the report of a sexual assault case, it's easy to understand a tormented Daily News editor's decision. But since newspapers are in the business of reporting facts not rumors, that decision, we hope, included a basic journalistic judgment call on whether the source-the police statement of the alleged victim-was credible or not. 

No matter what the conclusion on that count, the Daily's decision to report on the alleged sexual assault transformed one woman's personal narrative into a public matter. Rumors of an assault had been percolating through the campus hearsay networks for the last two months, but the particulars of the case, as they were reported in the Daily, are now debated and discussed more widely throughout the Yale community, a community that includes both the victim and the two alleged assailants. There is good reason for concern. In the co-educational context of Yale, few crimes could be more serious. The unisex settings at Yale, from our co-ed bathrooms to our seminars, are all predicated on the idea that men and women do not have to fear one another. By violating that trust, an incident of sexual assault threatens the interaction of ideas and individuals that is the foundation of Yale. 

The Daily was right, then, to make many of the details public. It's curious, though, that the paper chose to exclude the names of the accused in their initial story. No matter how unintentionally, the Daily gives the impression that they suspect the woman's police statement is a lie. If this were the case, the editors should never have run the story. 

On the other hand, one can conclude that the Daily was assuming the worst of its readers. The Daily's choice reflects their perception that the presumption of innocence does not apply at Yale. Who can say that wouldn't be pointed at as they attempt to walk to class? Once their names become public, there would be no guarantees that the allegations would not affect the way a TA might grade work or the way a professor might write a recommendation. But, if the Daily wanted to run this story at all, this was a chance they had to take. Reporting all the allegations in the victim's statement, except the names, insults the reasoning abilities of all the Daily's readers by suggesting that we cannot tell the difference between allegations and convictions. 

It also reeks of the worst kind of old-boy collegiality. The unspoken unity of Yale students can have positive effects. To a large extent, Yale students look out for each other, both before and after graduation. When Yale students work together they can accomplish wonderful things. But this camaraderie can also be a destructive force when the urge to protect one's own means that important information gets concealed. If the Daily editors truly believed that there's a good chance a crime occurred (whether or not the statement gives all the facts), why protect the alleged attackers from the burden of public scrutiny? 

At this point all these questions are academic. Now that the names have become public (thanks to the "Rumors" section of Rumpus) the responsibility for presuming innocence has been passed to the entire community. Are we better than who the Daily News thinks we are?
