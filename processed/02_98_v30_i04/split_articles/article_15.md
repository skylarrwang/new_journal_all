A Brief History of 
Sex at Yale 
N 
0 TOUR GUIDE HAS EVER IMPRESSED US WITH TALES OF 
Old Yale's sexiness. Tradition and heritage are far more 
genteel candidates. But Yale has been populated by stu-
dents of a similar age group almost since its founding; 
and as we are well aware, we're not currently in our quietest days. It 
takes little time to realize that college without silliness, fun, and the 
opposite sex has never really existed. 

pre-1900 
The phrase "Yale class of 1859" evokes images of elite young 
men smoking cigars in a musty room. What does not occur to most 
are the raucous "jubilees" held during this period to celebrate the 
completion of biennial exams. The tests covered all topics from 
Latin to geometry to European history. After they were finished, stu-
dents were ready for some fun, and they more than rose to the chal-
lenge of creating some. 

1900-1920 
"No fooling around with women. That'll queer you absolutely," 
an upperclassman advised Dink Stover, hero of Owen Johnson's 
Stover at Yale. Having a sexual relationship with a woman doomed 
the early 20th-century Yale man to banishment from the prestigious 
secret societies. A big night out meant going to see vaudeville 
dancers and later debating the relative merits of the women's physi-
cal traits. Stover explored other options, like the luncheons periodi-
cally held for Yale students by a friend's family. For Stover, this was 
the opportunity to court his friend's sister, but the relationship 
remained chaste. 

The organized social life of the period was similarly virginal, fea-
turing the junior and senior "promenades" for which a list of the 
attendants and of the chaperones was printed in the Yak Daily News. 
The only hints of intimate male-female interactions are in the Yale 
Literary Magazine, in which Yale men sentimentally described 
women they loved, lusted after, or imagined. 

1920s 
The students exhibited some desire to explore the opposite sex, 
but tradition was still staunchly in place and tend-
ed to cool matters significantly. Chaperones were 
common, both at school dances and on student 
tours, such as ones offered to Europe complete 
with "adequate chaperonage experienced in han-
dling students." 

The jubilees were loud and joyous celebrations 
which involved food, humorous stage acts and 
singing. At times, the atmosphere could be such 
that it was necessary to prohibi~ students from 
swinging on the chandeliers. The plays often had 
certain sexual and vulgar elements {o them, which 
grew until 1865 when the production was called 
an "indecent farce" by faculty, and the use of 
female characters (played by men however) was 
promptly banned in later jubilee shows. Ever 
resourceful, the students responded the following 
year by dressing the "women" in a sort of Turkish 
garb that conveyed the meaning just as well. Per-
haps realizing the futility of their position, the fac-
ulty soon reversed the ban. Among the celebratory 
songs at the jubilee, we find the song "Say Sisters, 
Will You Meet Us?" which concludes:

Advertisements in the Yale Daily News exhort-
ed Yale men to "Say it with flowers" and pay close 
attention to their dress, lest they be one of the 
"lamentable few" who arrive at the white-tie prom 
in a mere tux, much to their "social dismay." More 
casual mingling with the opposite sex would likely 
take place on the European tour as well, with an 
entire ship deck (of the several decks set aside for 
students) reserved for women's rooms. 

Yalies of this decade certainly felt that women 
had a defined sphere--one that was outside the 
classroom. A Yale Daily News editorial rails against 
co-education, predicting "rebellion at an invasion" 
by women, in part because the "difficulties of concentration, already 
great, would be dangerously accentuated" by a female presence. 
"Jupiter spare us from co-education," prays the editorial, "and keep 
the undergraduate schools homosexual."

1930s 
The decade saw a phasing out of the stern and staid customs of yes-
teryear. Tastes and attitudes began to modernize. Although girls might 
still spend days "deciding the size, length, 'will it go with the tie Bimbo 
always wears' problems," recalls then-Vassar 
student Faye Fation, Yalies had begun to take a 
greater interest in a woman's intellect. 

By the end of the decade, the New Haven 
Register reported that, "Only a scant handful 
of prom girls arrive with a chaperone." The 
Yak Daily News recounted that in preparation 
for the prom, "Swarms of femininity poured 
out of trains coming from the vital centers 
(Poughkeepsie, Northampton, Wellesley) into 
outstretched arms of waitingYale men." 

1940s 
"I don't like Kinsey! I don't like his 
report; I don't like anything about it," Pro-
fessor George A. Baitsell wrote in a 1948 
article in the Yak Daily News. This encapsu-
lates the campus-wide sentiments regarding 
Alfred Kinsey's Sexual Behavior in the 
Human Male, a study challepging American 
myths of fidelity and normative heterosexu- · 
ality published that same year. Kinsey's clas-
sification system for sexual preferences con-
tributed to Yale lingo in the form of the 
term "Kinsey 6," used to refer to exclusively 
gay men. Among those entering Yale that 
year was Martin Duberman (SM '52), a 
"Kinsey 6" and author of Cures: A Gay 
Man's Odyssey, which was published in 
1991. In his book, he recalls making his sis-
ter pose as his girlfriend to avoid embarrass-
ment. His quest to explore his sexuality 
while at Yale led only to anonymous, guilt-
and fear-ridden late-night trysts with 
strangers from the park benches and cruis-
ing cars of the Green. 

1950s 
"The weekends were .all about dating 
and Sf;X," Edward Rosen (BR '50) recalls. 
Weekends were a time of football and 
dances, at Yale or at any of the neighboring 
women's colleges such as Smith, Vassar, 
Wellesley, and Radcliffe. The major events, 
such as the Yale prom and Harvard week-
end, were the most sexually charged. Even 
then, Harvard weekend was an occasion for 
campus-wide parties, and the prom was rec-
ognizably formal and lavish, with live music 
and an elegant dinner. These events were a 
prime opportunity to invite your "favorite 
date" down for the weekend; and there 
would, Rosen says, "presumably be dessert 
after the main course." 

Relationships 
spanned the recognizable gamut. Rosen 
explains, "Some relationships were intimate, 
some were carnal, some were matrimonial, 
and some were frustrating." 

Yale made little effort during this time 
to discourage sexual activity. Girls were not 
allowed to spend the night in Yale dorms, 
and even the Hotel Taft made some effort 
to chaperone its guests. Both rules were 
half-heartedly enforced, however, and if one 
secured a room at the Hotel Gard, he would 
be assured of having no questions asked. 
Another difficulty was that Connecticut law 
then prohibited the sale of condoms, but 
again, determined students had little trou-
ble resolving the problem. "You just had to 
be a little resourceful," Rosen says, and the 
obstacles could be overcome. 

1960s 
Sex was on everyone's mind as Yale pon-
dered co-education. In fact, administrators 
and commentators feared that co-education 
would cause Yalies to think of little else. 
During a trial Co-education Week, the Yak 
Banner reported, "Rapes and other personal 
fouls were consistently avoided." Mixers 
continued to play a large role in the social 
scene. Even with co-education, however, the 
white-gloved 
"weekend 
women" 
were 
bussed in from Smith and Vassar. Only a 
small minority of the Yale student body was 
female, but many of these women were 
offended by the perceived need to import 
women to fuel the sexually charged atmos-
phere of the dances. 

By the end of the 1960s, Julia Preston 
(BR '73), writing in The New journal, 
described the relationships berween men 
and women as sex-or-nothing. She wrote of 
women entering long-term relationships to 
save themselves from unwelcome advances 
from peers, professors, and TAs. The few 
female students rarely formed friendships 
among themselves, and often lived entirely 
within their boyfriends' ~ocial circles. Pre-
ston also mentioned the now common con-
cerns about entering romantic relationships 
within one's college, "because the tense inti-
macy of the community precludes privacy." 
She added, "Yale men and women deal with 
each other through the medium of sexuality 
as if it were an immensely complicated 
peace treaty. You break the terms of the con-
tract and you can expect some kind of war-
fare." She worried that "friendship is in dan-
ger of becoming an insult, merely a state of 
sexual rejection," and argued that the sexual 
liberation many Yalies tout was false and a 
poor substitute for a "full co-education" 
that would allow male-female relationships 
to develop in a healthy f.tshion. 

1970s 
The tension between Yale men and 
women was dwarfed by the sudden accep-
tance of sex in general. Carrie Wingate (MC 
'77) says that sex during her time was seen 
as "just a really nice thing to do with anoth-
er person." Unlike the previous decade 
when women were concerned about their 
reputations, the 1970s attached little stigma 
to promiscuity. The new sexual freedom was 
connected with the general freedom that 
Wingate's contemporaries strove for. "We 
didn't want cars, or mortgages, or posses-
sional relationships." Wingate remembers 
this philosophy leading to empty, frustrat-
ing encounters and repressed jealousy. 

As Wingate recalls, this new permissive-
ness extended to homosexual relationships 
as well. There were still homophobic inci-
dents on campus and, several gay and les-
bian-oriented groups had appeared, includ-
ing {at various times) Yalesbians, the Yale 
Lesbian-Gay Cooperative, the Gay Alliance 
at Yale, and the Gay Student Center. While 
the 1970s were marked by political strug-
gles, such as fighting for permission to 
tabletent in Branford, the decade was also 
marked by an increase in the acceptance of 
homosexual relationships. 

1980s 
Playboy's "Women of the Ivy League," 
issue hit newsstands complete with Yale co-
eds. Yale could not revel in its sexuality, 
however, since this period also brought 
AIDS awareness. Recognizing the dangers 
of the disease and the need for education, 
Yale hired the founder of the Student AIDS 
Educators. During this time, gay and les-
bian groups became more active and accept-
ed on campus, starting a peer counseling 
group and pushing (unsuccessfully) for 
specifically gay freshman counselors. The 
Women's Center and the sexually focused 
feminist magazine Aurora were founded 
during this period.
