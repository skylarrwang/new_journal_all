I'M WRITING A PIECE ABOUT STUDENTS AT YALE WHO ARE LIV-
ing with HIV and/or AIDS. What I have sent you is a totally 
anonymous interview. I gave this letter, along with the enve-
lope addressed to me, to the person who knows you, and he 
or she got this package to you. The purpose of this piece is to raise aware-
ness. I want to understand better why there is such a stigma; why our cul-
ture demands that HIV patients must keep their disease a secret." I sealed 
the envelopes and sent out the letters. 

I checked my mailbox each morning, hoping for a· response to my 
questions, but no luck. People who knew HIV-positive Yalies-and some 
of the doctors who treated them-had delivered my letters. Yet each day 
at the post office I was greeted by a shiny metal corridor-nothing. A let-
ter would mean a chance to give voice to the silent, the infected. But as 
the days passed, I found myself wondering what HIV meant to the 
throngs hurrying past me and my empty mailbox. 

HIV is here at Yale. Doctors tell me there are HIV-positive· under-
graduates. Students tell me they have friends with HIV. Yet HIV 
is an issue few discuss, few consider, and few grasp as part of 
their lives. In 1995, The New Journal devoted an entire issue to AIDS 
without a mention of the disease on campus. Three years later, HIV 
remains an issue from which most students consistently distance them-
selves. Why do so few people consider this disease a part of their day-to-
day lives? Why don't we think it happens at Yale? 

"HIV at Yale? It's just something I guess I never thought of," Arturo 
Martinez (ES '99) says. "I only think about it when I see it in magazines, 
on TV. It's not an everyday topic of discussion." In trying to learn about 
HIV's psychological presence at Yale, I encountered this distancing in stu-
dent after student. Most everybody realizes that HIV exists, but few see it 
as more than a public service announcement or news story. But whether 
or not we think we know someone who deals with HIV at Yale, the virus 
is in our midst. 

"The rate of HIV occurrence within the Yale community is 0.5 
percent, the same as the rest of the American population," Dr. James 
Perlotto (ES '74), University Health Services' AIDS specialist tells me. 
"I believe there are 25 to 75 people with HIV at Yale. The majority of 
those are graduate students, but there are undergraduates who test pos-
itive for HIV." In a 1994 study of 24 college campuses, the Center for 
Disease Control reported that 1 in 500 students tested positive for 
HIV. Yale is no different. HIV is here. 

In the U.S., the AIDS epidemic has entered a somewhat hopeful 
phase. Over the past five years, researchers have found effective ways to 
deter the growth of HIV. A 1996 New York Times Magazine article by 
Andrew Sullivan, entitled "The End of AIDS," argued that with the 
advent of protease inhibitors and multi-drug cocktail regimens, AIDS 
would become an analogue to diabetes and other chronic diseases-a life-
altering condition, but not an instant death sentence. What once was a 
nation facing the uncertainty of a plague can now view the next five years 
of the epidemic with very cautious optimism, even as the disease contin-
ues to slowly spread. AIDS is no longer quite the "sexy" media topic it 
once was, though third-world and inner-city rates of infection skyrocket 
and the poor cannot afford the medications that allow infected patients 
to fight the disease. 

I began searching for HIV-positive students in order to hear what cop-
ing with the virus meant to people at a place so established and intel-
lectual that its emotional tenor can at best be described as aloof. With 
the knowledge that fellow students have HIV, I talked to undergraduates 
by the dozen, explaining what I was doing. I spoke at meetings, to sports 
teams, to classmates. I called and called and called. Still no responses. 

Soon I realized it wasn't the students who knew people with HIV 
who would answer my question. Instead it was the people who didn't 
know someone who would tell me the most. As I explained that I was 
writing about HIV, the majority of students readied themselves for policy 
questions and prepared their most enlightened attitudes for the safe-sex 
survey queries we're all used to. When asked matter-of-factly if they knew 
someone who had HIV at Yale, I saw my classmates act uncomfortable, 
put-off, and initially skeptical. 

Most were very surprised by the statistics. At first, hearing that one in 
200 people in the Yale community has HIV was frightening. And many 
did not believe that students had tested positive at YUHS. 

"College students think they're supermen," Angel Falcon, (ES '99) 
says. "People talk lots about hooking up at Yale, but no one ever men-
tions getting HIV or anything else. When I go home to Jersey, people talk 
about HIV much more-people are scared." 

Many students aren't surprised that HIV isn't discussed. "Yale is a dif-
ferent community than most," Cameron MacDougall (ES '98) explains. 
"Not to be elitist, but the reason that HIV isn't an issue here is that you're 
dealing with a highly educated population, coming from good homes. 
They know the proper precautions to take, and they're less sexually active 
than most students. If this were UVA, it would be a different story." 

Dr. Perlotto knows the story is, in fact, not "so different. As an AIDS 
specialist, his HIV-positive patients come to him to talk about the disease 
and get help. Since his arrival at Yale in 1990, he's broken the news to 
dozens of HIV-positive students, made close associations with many 
patients, and mourned the deaths of students alongside their families. 
-THE NEW JOURNAL


Depending on the week, 5 to 20 percent of Dr. Perlotto's caseload is 
devoted to HIV counseling, testing, and treating his nine graduate student 
HIV patients-some with symptoms of AIDS. Dr. Perlotto's patients 
research, work on their theses, and teach sections. AIDS is only debilitat-
ing in its late stages and few show visible symptoms of the disease. 

Watching Dr. Perlotto speak candidly about the difficulties of treat-
ing AIDS patients, I see how he has gained a reputation as an honest, 
dedicated caregiver. Yet even at an "enlightened" place like Yale, Perlotto's 
reputation as "the AIDS doctor" can frighten non-HIV patients. "Some-
times people are afraid to come see me for anything," he says, frustrated. 
"They're worried that someone will think they are coming to be treated 
for AIDS." 

HIV is an issue on every campus. People are concerned," says 
Shannon Morrison (TC '00), an AIDS educator and coordinator of the_Yale Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender 
Co-op. "The disease crosses boundaries of race, color, sexual orientation," 
Morrison says. Yet he also feels that as the issue has become more politi-
cized, it has receded into the margins. "Although the disease touches a lot 
of our lives, a lot of people still don't believe that AIDS is not a gay thing. 
A lot of straight people are tired of hearing about AIDS." 

But aren't the risks of infection negligible in college? Dr. Alvin 
Novick, the Yale professor whose class, AIDS and Society, usually attracts 
several hundred students, warns that despite the relatively low incidence 
of the disease among college students, it should not be ignored. "Incidence 
of HIV infection in college students is quite low," Dr. Novick says. 
"For those of college age it's not a threat to society, but it's still important 
to talk about." 


I'm dealing with people who see the risk of infection as real enough to come get tested," said one doctor who counsels undergraduates at YUHS. "It's the people I don't see who feel invulnerable." Talking with a 
doctor before an HIV test is one of the few ways students face the reality 
of AIDS. Despite YUHS's policy of confidential testing-in which positive 
results are recorded though kept secret as opposed to the anonymous 
testing available elsewhere in New Haven, in which names are never 
attached to test results-many undergraduates come each week for HIV-
antibody screening. YUHS won't release statistics on testing. However, 
one of the five caregivers who administer tests pulled out a folder of test 
results from the previous year, thick with forms. Between all five they 
must test hundreds of students. "Though a lot of students say they 
should be tested, many never go," AIDS educator Andrew Stadlen (OE 
'98) says. "For many, it's a hassle." 

Still, YUHS doctors have seen a gradual increase in testing as awareness has spread. "In 1985, the few students who came for testing were 
very worried," a doctor says. "Nowadays, getting tested is a more casual 
thing, and many more students come. Some of my patients who come 
are high-risk cases. A few seek testing with an incident in mind, some are 
anxious about a rumor about a past lover, and others have another STD 
which makes them fear HIV. Others show up with little or no risk of 
infection. They are the worried well. I don't look forward to the day I 
have to tell someone they're HIV-positive." 

At YUHS, test results are given one week after the blood is sampled. 
In the ten minutes prior to the second appointment, the moments of 
contemplation in the sterile waiting area can add a dose of bitter reality to 
a hectic day of contrived importance. But once back in Yale World, safely 
negative, it is natural to forget that a moment ago life hinged on one 
word from a doctor. One races off, late to class. That's as close as many 
get to HIV. The test becomes just another way for the Yale student to 
make sure the reality of the disease has not accidentally slipped into his or 
her world. 

Within a few years, however, all of us will probably know people who 
are infected. AIDS is the most common cause of death for American men 
aged 25 to 44, and people aged 18 to 21 are among the fastest growing 
risk groups for HIV. The statistics are chilling. We worry about our rela-
tionships, our jobs, our homework, and our plans for the weekend. Yet 
most Yale students don't worry about HIV. 

Many Yalies go at least part way towards practicing the measures that 
help prevent the spread of the disease. "From an anecdotal perspective,
