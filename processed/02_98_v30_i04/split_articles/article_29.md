EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Preparing for the special issue, we quickly realized that when it comes to sex, men and women seem to speak in different 
languages. So, we sent two of our editors, armed with tape recorders, to document typical discussions men and women have 
about sex and relationships when the opposite sex isn't around. To preserve the candid dialogue, we kept the participants 
anonymous. And, resisting the urge to draw conclusions, we will let the words stand on their own. 

Tim: Here's rhe thing about me. I never got any in high school. I 
kissed a girl sophomore year, and I had a girlfriend my junior 
year, and we hooked up a little, but it was pretty asexual. She 
even told me once-and this is when I knew I was going to break 
up with her-"1 like your look, you're kind of like that guy from 
the Black Crowes, asexual." I was like, "It's over." And then I 
kissed one girl after that. 

Greg: So the first time you had sex was at Yale? 

Tim: Yeah, and after that, things just fell into place. You kind of 
just hit your stride. And now my roommates think I'm just 
making up for lost time. 

Patrick: That's the same with me. I got even less than you in high 
school. I finally kissed a girl senior year, but never had a girlfriend 
or anything. 

Greg: I hooked up more in high school than now, but I only slept 
with one girl then. 

Tim: I could not have slept with a girl in high school, I was not ready. 

Patrick: Yeah, it's weird because now you're well-known as having 
good luck with the women. 

· 

Tim: The thing that happens with me is that I'll see a girl and I'll 
want her for a while quietly, and then somehow it just kind of 
works out. It's happened to me like three or four times. 

Patrick: It must be nice. 

Greg: Where was the first rime you had sex? Was it at Yale, like in 
a bunk bed? 

Tim: No, it was a single on Old Campus. It had to happen 
somewhere. I only had sex in my own bed at home once. 

FEBRUARY 13, 1998 

Karen: Faking is an easy topic, so let's talk about that. 

Linda: You fake? 

Karen: It's an easy topic because no, I don't. Never. 

Linda: You don't?! 

Amy: Yeah, me neither. Never. 

Melissa: Depends on the situation. 

Karen: You want to know why I never fake?. See, I never fake 
because if they're not doing it for me, they better know. I just 
think it's a waste of your time. Okay, lee's say it's the first time. 
It's hard to give instructions. but you can move your body in 
completely suggestive ways. 

Linda: I fake all the time. No problems with that. 

Karen: Are you kidding? Is it entertaining for you, like the acting 
pan of it? 

Linda: Yeah, it amuses me because, you know, it's like whatever-

Karen: -yes, you can be like, "They're so stupid!" 

Amy: It's run through my head before, but never. I couldn't. I feel 
guilty and also I feel like an orgasm is not the do-all end-all. I 
mean, I enjoy sex. Bottom fucking line. 

Linda: I feel guilty if I'm just silent. With some guys you don't 
even have time to fake it. It's like in, out, and you're like okay, all 
right, great. 

Karen: Yeah, it's like, "Clearly you don't know what you're doing." 

Linda: Right. It's like, "I'll lie here for you next time and we'll 
work on this." But with some men, I definitely feel like I get 
more excited when I hear them being excited. 

All: Yeah, definitely. 


Patrick: That was some of the best sex I've ever had. It was so 
great. We had to be really quiet. She had to sneak back up to the 
room she was staying in, because my parents would check. 

Tim: Having sex in my girlfriend's apartment was weird though, 
because it was a one-room apartment. We had sex on the fold-out 
couch and had to fold it back in, and then sit there having a 
conversation on that same couch an hour later with her parents. 
And one time I thought we left a condom on the floor. I just felt 
so guilty. ''I'm sorry Mr. So-and-So, I just fucked your daughter." 

Patrick: You know what's kind of weird? You might be getting 
kind of a reputation. 

Tim: Me? 

Patrick: I don't know, in a little way. I just said your name one 
time, and they were like, "Yeah, he's really good looking, but 
doesn't he hook up with anything that moves?" 

Tim: Ahhh! The reputation thing sucks. I kind of deserve it 
though. I thought I was discerning about who I hooked up with, 
but yeah, it's been getting kind of goofy. I don't care, I guess. I 
mean what does it matter, right? I don't hook up with anything 
that moves. I'm really careful. If she's a person who can handle a 
cheap thing, then it's like sure, but if it's someone I care about 
and really respect, I'm just not going to get" involved. Reputations 
suck. Who said it? 

Greg: Women talk. There's this network. 

Tim: So, how do you get them to leave Patrick? 

Greg: You kick them out at six in the morning! 

Patrick: I don't kick them out. I just-that's my problem, I don't 
get them to leave. I always kind of play along when they start 
doing the "I really want to hang out with you" t}ling, .and I'm 
like, "Yeah, me too." And then you kind of just say what you 
need to to get them to leave, and then you're like oh shit I think I 
kind of promised them something and they're going to get hurt. 

Tim: And then it's going to be a bunch of bumpy phone calls until 
they realize what you itwally-meant. That's how I feel. 

Patrick: Or at least, a weird "Hey, how's it going?" when you see 
them. But I don't understand. It seems like such a 19th century 
thing to be like, "Oh since we've slept together, that means I'm so 
committed to you." I've never understood why there should be 
such a connection in just one night. 

Greg: I feel that connection. That's why I get all hung up on one 
woman. 

Tim: You get hung up on the woman, not the sex. 

Greg: No, that's not quite it. They're inseperable, the woman as a 
person and the sex. I don't have sex with a lot of women, and the 
ones that I do, I then feel bound to. I've only slept with three 
women, so each one's a big deal ro me. 

Tim: I was just number 31 for this girl. 

Greg: Really?! 

Tim: And it scared the shit out of me, I was like, "What the fuck?" 

Patrick: How did this come up, how did she tell you? 

Tim: It just came up afterwards, you know during that pose-sex 
safe sex talk: "Now that we've actually had sex, what do you think 
of STDs?" I was like, "Dude, you're not even a double digit for 
me." I accidently made her feel bad about it. She was like "Well, 
thanks for making me feel like a slut." I didn't mean it in that 
way, just wow, that's a lot of people. 

Greg: Were you nervous because she'd been with so many men? 

Tim: No, not really. I'd ~efinitely given her signals that I thought 
she was cut'e. But it wasn't that romantic or that special, it's just 
not. Last week I went to visit this friend down at Georgetown, 
and she's just a good friend. We didn't sleep together, we kissed a 
little bit, but we just slept in the same bed and talked and stuff, 
and that was much nicer, the kind of thing I'd like to do again. 

Greg: What was this girl like, how was her body? 

Tim: She's hot, but like no, it's not about physical hotness, it's about 
warmth. With some girls you feel more warmth than with others. 

Greg: Sometimes it's about heat. 

Tim: No, heat is like exercise. 

Patrick: It's about heat, about chemistry, but heat is a false feeling. 

Tim: Yeah, you get like, "Uh-uh," but it only lasts for like an 
hour. 

Patrick: Yeah, it's all bullshit though. 

Tim: It's the warmth that keeps you returning to the same person. 
Because you're like, "Wow, you made me feel so good to hang out 
with yesterday that I want to hang out with you again." 

Greg: I suppose, but there has to be that hot base. 

Tim: You know what I realized? When I went down to visit this 
girl at Georgetown, I really felt myself just opening up a little bit. 
I think I'm this open, talkative guy. But the truth is that I'm 
really not that open with most peoele. I think ,J,he reason I'm so 
hung up on my ex-girlfriend and why it hur'tso ihucb when she 
said goodbye is because our personal lives were so integrated, and 
that's why I think she got claustrophobic. It was like having a best 
friend who you can have sex with. It's fucked up when that ends. 
That's why I'm on this spree of cheap flin~. Cheap flings suck, 
they're not that special. 

Patrick: No, it's not that. It's that you kind of always want what 
you don't have a little bit. 

Tim: Yeah, when I was with her, I was like, oooh that girl, I'm 
curious. And the best part is th apptbach, the'1ooks across a 
party, the "oh you want to come up to my room?" the flirting, 
getting drunk together, bumming cigarettes, and the walk to the 
bedroom, and maybe the first kiss, and maybe feeling the 
breasts-okay, it can go on for a while. 

Greg: And the wetness between their legs. 

Tim: Gross. 

Greg: You can't be like, "Gross," you've got to be into that. 

Tim: No, I've always been so freaked out by vaginas. I think it's 
because of my sisters-I'm scared of aU these feminine things. But 
I think that's part of my secret to relating to women. 

Greg: The fear of the vagina is his secret! 

Patrick: I have this question actually, especially because you don't 
hook up that much, do you feel any pressure to have this active 
sex life, that your sex life is somehow definitive of your manhood 
or anything? 

Greg: Not at all. I feel pretty much no pressure. There was a 
couple of months last year, when I felt so content, I didn't feel 
like I needed a woman. I was horny, I masturbated, but I never 
really looked at the women around me. Like I'd meet someone 
pretty and be flirting with her, but the possibility just didn't enter 
my mind. You've never felt that way, that it doesn't matter? 


Linda: For me it's a very aural type of thing. I don't feel guilty 
when I fake it. I've actually been asked if I've faked it and said no 
when I had. I lied, I lied. 

Amy: Are you serious? Now wait, here's a question. I feel like I 
couldn't even begin to fake it because they feel it. 

Linda: See, I think that's a lie because I don't think all guys know 
about that. 

~ 

Melissa: Well, you can contract your muscles on your own. 

Amy: Yeah, that's true. 

Linda: You can? 

Melissa: Yeah, ready? I can do it right now. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. 

Amy: Me, too. 

K_!fen· You did not jt.fst say that. Holy shit. 

.............. 

~elissa: It's called Kegel exercises. 

_ ' 

Amy: You can totally feel it. Ready contract. Evtiybody practice. 
Po it right now. 

~areJJ: I can feel it. What did you call it? 

~elfssa: Kegel exercises. They're exercises you cah do to tighten 
:your muscles and you can do that while you're having sex. You 
\:an do that to grip the member and you know.

Linda: Your knowledge never ceases to amaze me. The thing is, for 
long time I didn't know whether I was having 
orgasm or not. 

In-chi!'heginnhtgyou"Te likew:wthat'tt?' Did 1 just have one? 

Melissa: Yeah, but then when you do have one, you just know. 

Amy: Then you realize you've never had one before. 

Linda: When I have an orgasm it starts with this tingle in my toes. 

Amy: It starts in the feet. 

Melissa: That's when you hit the point of no return. 

Karen: Do you all squirm? I won't stay in one place, especially if 
I'm on a futon. I'll just walk down the futon. I've literally been 
told to stay still before because I just keep going. I just love it. It 
makes my body jerk in ways I obviously can't control. 

Linda: Do you scream or do you breathe heavily? 

Karen: I don't scream. 

Amy: I breathe heavily. 

Linda: I think I grip arms. 

Amy and Melissa: Yeah, so do I. 

Linda: It's kind of like, "If you leave I will kill you." 

Karen: I totally grip. 

Karen: I don't give blow jobs on the first hook up. They could go 
down on me 800 times and it's so obvious that they want one but 
I hate giving them. That's all there is too it. 

Melissa: I disagree. I love giving them. 

Karen: What?! 

Melissa: If I'm with someone I find it very intimate. It turns me on. 

Linda: I have issues with taking my pants off and letting that 
person make me happy. It's a very protective sort of thing. Like, if 
I let you excite me then I will be attached to you. 

Karen: Yeah. 

Amy: Also, oral sex is more intimate than sex. 

Karen: It's also very hands on. 

Linda: It's also very one-sided at the time i:hat it's happening. 

Karen: Well, not necessarily. Meanwhile, that is fun. 

Melissa: That is fun. But sometimes it's just too hard to 
concentrate. You're like, "Oh my god, what is going on?" You feel 
like your technique is breaking down because you can't focus. 

Linda: Do you have technique? 

Melissa: Yeah, de-finitely. I have a technique. 

Karen: There's a definite pattern. 

Melissa: I'll just put in a note as a student AIDS educator that 
you really shouldn't swallow. Because there is a risk associated 
with getting diseases through oral sex. 

Amy: Really? 

Melissa: Yeah. You can completely reduce your risk by not 
swallowing. If you don't let any semen in your mouth you really 
reduce your risk. 

Linda: What if you spit? 

Melissa: That's better than swallowing. But if you don't let it into 
your mouth at all, that's the best. You can do the old "just give 
me a holler when you're about to you know." 

Karen: I think in general you can tell. 

Linda: You can feel a little vein pulse and you know it's about to 
happen. Meanwhile, it doesn't taste good. Let's just put that out 
on the table now. 

Amy: Yeah, and it's a respect. issue too. If you're not in a serious 
relationship and they expect you to swallow, it's like a violation. 

Linda: If they don't inform me or even make a motion to pull 
away, that makes me angry because then it's in your mouth. 
There's no place to spit it and it's like, "Now what do you expect 
me to do?" That's not respecting me. 

Amy: Exactly. 

Linda: And then there's the whole after-oral-sex-kiss thing. Kiss or no? 

Amy: Yes. Kiss. 

Melissa: Yes. 

Linda: It's like an intimate way of saying that was okay and nice. 

Melissa: Hey, have you guys ever tried any food products? 

Karen: Marshmallow. 

Melissa: Whipped cream. 

Karen: Nutella. That's totally good. 

Amy: I want to try Hershey's syrup. 

Karen: Marshmallows were actuaJly extremely disgusting but 
extremely incredible. You can put them pretty much anywhere 
and everywhere. Think taffy. 

Karen: You know what else? I love right before you hook-up. 

Linda: Why? Because you've got that feeling that you're going to 
hook up with someone? 

Karen: Yeah, anA you also know that you're good. It's like you can 
stand there and say ro him ~~your mind, "Yeah buddy, you don't 
even know whauou're atlout to deal with.." The best was in the 
middle someoQ_,e once'said, "Holy shit." 

Linda: I got-an "I'm melting." That was grear. 

Karen: First night: seven'posit1ons. 

Lillila: What?!'My &rsc:time I could only be on top because it hurt 
too much an~Chtr way. 

' 

Karen: Mine didn't.ht.trrat all. 

Melissa: Jlosr my virginity in my own bedroom. 

Linda: Have you ever done it in your parents' bed? 

Melissa: Yeah, I've done it there. 

Karen: Okay, let's talk about positions. 

Linda: Top is good but after a while your legs start to fucking hurt.
