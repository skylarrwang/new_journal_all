"There is an erroneous impression current nowadays that sex is everything .... Sex is by no means everything. It varies, as a matter of fact, from only as high as 78 percent of everything to as low as 3.10 percent. The norm, in a sane, healthy person, should be between 18 and 24 percent." 
James Thurber and E.B. White 
Is Sex Necessary? (1929) 

We at The New Journal are convinced of our own sanity and health. In this issue of TNJ, however, sex is everything. This is our annual special issue, our chance to examine one subject from many different angles, and what subject could be more deserving of 100 percent of our attention than sex? 

Sex is wrapped up, literally and figuratively, with issues of our personal identity: race, age, religion, gender, education, and economics. The relevance of sex extends across these boundaries. Thurber and White chose their subject 70 years ago because they saw a change in the way society dealt with sex. We chose ours because we saw something timeless in sex. Sex and identity exist together in an odd symbiotic relationship. Sex defines who we are, and who we are defines our notions of sex. 

In choosing to write about sex we knew that we'd be running a gauntlet that many have failed. In essence sex is a private act, so there's something unnatural about any attempt to write about it publicly. Sex writing is notoriously bad (see p. 46) and we wanted to avoid the tendency among writers to get further and further away from the intimacy of sex as they get further and further into writing. 

Thurber and White confronted this same problem. They discussed the pitfalls that many aspiring sex writers fall into. "We saw, chiefly, that these writers expended their entire emotional energy in their writing and never had time for anything else .... They clearly hadn't been out much. They had been home writing; and meanwhile what was sex doing? Not standing still you better believe." 

Faced with the challenge, then, of seeking out sex in all its forms and metaforms, we adopted the attitude of Thurber and White. "Our procedure would be to approach sex bravely, and frequently. 'Approach the subject in a lively spirit,' we told ourselves, 'and the writing will take care of itself.' (It is only fair to say that the writing didn't take care of itself; the writing was a lot of work and gave us the usual pain in the neck while we were doing it.)" 

We know the pain in the neck that Thurber and White were talking about, but luckily we had the help of the following people in putting this issue together: Annie Barrett, Andrew Cohen, Erika Fricke, Shmully Hecht, Mihira Jayasekera, Katie Lee, Planned Parenthood of Connecticut, John Schochet, and Nick Yorgakaros.
