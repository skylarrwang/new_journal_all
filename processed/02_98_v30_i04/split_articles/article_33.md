Thinking About Thinking About Sex 
by Gabriel Snyder 
Nerve Magazine (http:/ ;www.nervemag.com) 

NUKE RESPECTABLE SITES ON THE 
Internet, Nerve immediately con-
fronts the browser with a stern warn-
ing, "Nerve is a magazine of daring nude pho-
tography and brash writing about sex and 
gender." The notice hangs over the site like a 
faux "DANGER" sign on a wooden rollercoast- · 
er; the caution serves to make you feel like 
what you are doing is, well, a bit crazy- no 
matter how much you are counting on the 
tracks to hold up and the ride operators to 
know how to make the ride as utterly free of 
danger as possible. What you have come for is 
a careful simulation of exactly what you want 
to avoid. 

Nerve has dubbed itself "literate smut." 
The irony is intentional, but only partially. 
For a sexual culture like the one at Yale, where 
sex is easily politicized, theorized, and ana-
lyzed in seminars and senior essays, where per-
sonal feelings on sex are rarely acknowledged 
openly, where people are much more comfort-
able with the theory of sex than its practice, 
Nerve attempts to strike that perfeft balance 
between reason and passion, intellect and 
desire. Nerve winks at those of us who see 
ourselves as too smart to bow to the level of 
smut and agrees not to insult our intelligence 
with prurient photos and stories-all the time 
acknowledging that that's what we came for in 
the first place. 

But Nerve is not simply a high-brow ver-
sion of the corner porn shop. The purpose of 
dirty movies or Hustkr magazine is to make a 
person think about having sex. The fantasy 
that Nerve presents is not of indulging in sex, 
but rather it is the fantasy of being someone 
who fantasizes about indulging in sex. 

SINCE THE SITE WAS U.UNCHED u.sT JUNE, 
Nerve has received warm receptions from the 
mainstream media which has been attracted 
more to essays by Nerve's well-known contrib-
utors (Norman Mailer, Jocelyn Elders, and 
Quentin Crisp, to name a few) than to any of 
the site's racier selections. And the site does 
not Jack for interesting reads, whether it be an 
account by a male prostitute, a ~ieee about 
selling sex toys in homes · (a la ~->Tupperware 
parties), or porn king AI Gol~stejn:s t~ 'of the 
beginnings of Screw . . With its ·£~anguished 
writers and photographers, Nerve aspires to 
join the pantheon of intelligent web sites, dis-
played dearly by the site's two main advertis-
ers: Feed and Salon-the two titans, so to 
speak, of on-line culture. 

Nerve's two founders, Rufus Griscom and 
Genevieve Field, cenainly have the credentials 
to run a hip but smart new media venture. 
They are both refugees from the trenches of 
the New York literary world. Griscom even 
has the good taste to have graduated from an 
Ivy League school. But perhaps the most 
imponant qualification to run a site such as 
Nerve that Field and Griscom hold is that the 
two have been lovers for the last two years. 
On the site, they take on the personas of two 
sex-crazed teenagers: "We are a couple of gar-
den-variety sex enthusiasts, much like the rest 
of you mammals. On a good night we call out 
to the heavens and thrash abour like hooked 
bass, clamoring after those precious few sec-
onds of blindness." 

The content Nerve offers, though, makes 
all the rancor about smutty high culture seem 
a little silly. The photographs are as shocking 
as an art school crit, and the fiction is as dar-
ing as a college literary magazine. Everything 
is "good," to be sure, but with the mission of 
striking the difficult tone of literate smut, the 
works are warped into something they 
wouldn't normally be. Barbara Vaughn tries to 
capture the beauty of the nude form by taking 
photos of herself naked outdoors on rocks and 
in forests. Field writes of Vaughn's work, "Her 
greatest challenge .. .is to avoid the deliberate 
sexuality that the viewer exp<its to find in 
images of the nude form." Vaughn can be con-
fident that the challenge has been overcome. 
But, in the context of Nerve, Vaughn's pictures 
don't seem very smart {or very smutty). With 
the site's insistence that it means to turn its 
users on, the viewer who wants to appreciate 
Vaughn's photos is reduced to a 12-year-old 
boy snickering at the paintings by Titian by 
noting that, after all, they are of naked women. 

Elsewhere on the site, Nerve's attempts to 
be smutty fall ridiculously flat. For example, in 
the first installment of Jack Murnighan's col-
umn titled "Naughty Bits," he promises, 
"Every week I will be culling a particularly de-
gant or juicy moment from the last three thou-
sand years of fiction and poetry for your edifi-
cation and arousal." One can imagine excerpts 
from D.H. Lawrence or the Kama Sutra filling 
the space, but Murnighan's choice is the story 
of Paolo and Francesca from Dante's Inferno. 
Of such staid lines as, " ... this one, I Who 
from me will never be taken, I Kissed me, his 
body 
all 
trembling, 
on 
the 
mouth," 
Murnighan coos like an eighth-grade English 
teacher, "Even in the Middle Ages they knew 
how to appreciate the naughty bits!" 

When Nerve does come dose to making 
us blush-as in Philip Martin's shott story, 
"The Eavesdropper" - the layers of irony turn 
the author into a fool. With "The Eavesdrop-
per" Marcin seems to be ashamed to be stoop-
ing so low. His account of a failed marri~ 
interspersed with a blow-by-blow description 
THE NEw joURNAL 

of the couple's first time having sex-is not 
very far removed from a Penthouse letter. But 
with tips like this dialogu;; we know this isn't 
what he meant to do at all: 

"Do you want to fuck me?" She breathed. 
"More than anything in the world." 
"You want to fuck me hard?" 
"I want to fuck your brains out." 
She laughed. 
"Oh Will, that's not so original." 
"No, it's not." 

We can't help from laughing either. The edi~ 
tors and writers know all too well that the 
smutry and the literate have nothing to do 
with each other, and the juxtaposition of the 
rwo is ludicrous to the point of being funny. 
We can read "The Eavesdropper" as if it were 
pornography, but only if we ignore Martin's 
attempts at being original through his uno rig~ 
inality. And if we want to appreciate it as liter~ 
ature, we must rationalize the sexuality away 
until it disappears. 

This absurd juxtaposition occurs again 
and again on Nerve. In a photograph by 
Charles Gatewood, we see a naked woman 
lying on a waterbed, legs spread toward the 
camera. She is masturbating, with one hand 
in her crotch and the other gripping at a 
breast. Surrounding her are 16 fashionable 
New York gallery~goers, pensively analyzing 
the performance artist's every moan. In the 
context of the drag queens and dominatrixes at 
discos and street festivals that make up the rest 
of his photo essay, Gatewood is clearly poking 
fun at such staid intellectuals. But it is bruising 
commentary on Nerve's project, as well. Cro~ 
ping out the gathered crowd of high-brows, he 
would have an image that he could sell to any 
porn magazine, but confronted with such a 
sexual display, the only reaction the culturally 
informed can muster is quiet study. 

The unmaking of Nerve is found in the 
site's statement of intent, tided with mock 
indignation, "What Are We Thinking? (An 
Apologia)," where Griscom and Field 
unwillingly stumble upon their own failings. 
They complain that smut trying to pass as 
art does not understand, "that once our 
desire reaches a certain clip, attempts at 
artistry become annoying obstacles in the 
path of the nouns and verbs (or precious 
pixels) that deliver the goods."
