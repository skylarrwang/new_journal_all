During his iunior year of high school, 
Gene Hudng (SM '98) experienced an 
abrupt transition from being an 
outsider Asian nerd to the big man 
on campus. "The social image I have 
set up for myself is one which is 
consciously, actively trying to escape 
the fact that I am Asian American," 
Huang says. 


process the impact their physical differences have upon their self-
esteem and sexual identity, but often the real awareness comes 
retroactively. Of course, the childhood experience of an Asian man 
growing up in Orange County, California-where the Asian popula-
tion of a public high school may comprise 50 percent of the stu-
dents--differs markedly from that child growing up in a small, pre-
dominantly caucasian rown in Minnesota. 


The American media, however, reaches all of these men. Asian 
American men are emasculated by virtue of their absence. Rarely is 
an Asian American man cast as the romantic Cassanova of a movie or 
television show. The typically petite frame of an Asian woman, on 
the other hand, satisfies the American aesthetic of exotic feminine 
beauty. For example, James Bond's beauty of choice in Tomorrow 
Never Dies is Michelle Yueh. The absence of a sexually virile male role 
model, unless Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan count, breeds sexual inse-
curity in the psyche of Asian American men. Tequila shots are the 
panacea. 


B
ack at the MOCKA. party: A couple of guys are sitting on the 
windowsill in their CK shins and loose-fitting jeans, casually 
chic, smoking th.eir cigarettes and scoping the mostly familiar 
crowd in a disinterested manner as they make plans for the next 
Asian American Student Association basketball tournament. In one 
corner: a drunken pair is sloppily hooking up to a background buzz.

of not-so-subtle, knowing commentary. "Hasn't she really been into 
someone else for the longest time? Why is she sucking face with him 
now? Too much to drink." And in another corner: a guy and girl, 
holding their accessory drinks, have a friendly chat while swaying 
absently to the music. In their sobriety, they are physically far apart, 
and each initiation of physical contact is deliberate. Off to the side of 
the room: a group of men-and again, a few women who are man 
enough-assemble for a round of tequila shots. 


There is a common perception among Asian American women 
that Asian American men are more brotherly than sexual or sensual. 
Fuphan Chou (TC '00), a 5'9" Taiwanese American sophomore, has 
never kissed an Asian man and remains outside of the tight Asian 
scenes. She has found Asian American men attractive in the past, but 
attractions are only realized by approaching someone--something 
she finds men consistently fail to do. These men fall short in both a 
literal and figurative sense. Fuphan feels like a "big freak giant" 
around many Asian American men. "You usually flirt with a guy and 
you think, wow, the guy might be interested-in females? period. But 
you flirt with an Asian guy and he becomes your brother," she says. 


Many women within the tight-knit Asian community share 
Fuphan's sentiments, whether it is due ro a specific male vibe, or by 
their own paranoia that the Asian American community will become 
gossipy and incestuous if it views relationships with Asian men in a 
sexual way. The men have to bear the stigma of feeling asexual, but 
not because asexuality is an inherent trait. 


This stereotype is frequently imposed upon 
them. Women, particularly if they are 
entrenched in a scene where there is poten-
tial for gossip, may be guilty of this imposi-
tion. 


The culprit most responsible for the 
emasculation of Asian American men, how-
ever, is the American definition of male sex-
uality. A male is considered to be sexual only 
when he is physically aggressive and bold. In 
an American environment of large gestures 
and overtly sexual relations between men 
and women, there is little room for subtlety. 
~thin Asian cultures, subtlety of expression 
is highly valued. This subtlety often hinders 
the ability to communicate the sexual vibe 
that is so important in American male-
female interactions. "I was never touchy-
feely with people. My family never was, s~ 
· neither am I," Isaac Cheng (MC '00) says. 


This is perceptible in those two feet of space, 
in that physical gap between the man and 
woman swaying to the music. 


In examining ·che sexuality of Asian 
American men, it is important to also exam-
ine who these men are approaching. For 
many Asian American men, the way they 
approach a woman is often linked to her 
race. "I prefer women who are outgoing and 
strong-willed and I often think of Asian 
women as very reserved. Of course, I'll 
approach them directly if they don't seem. co 
have a problem with that," Bertram Chan 
(SY '00) says. For some men, there may be a 
weightiness attached to dating someone 
within their own race due to pressures exert-
ed by family and community. That pressure, 
to some degree, disallows frivolity and free-
dom in approaching women of the same 
race. 


Dating outside of their race presents a 
whole different challenge for Asian Ameri-
can men. Complexities may arise because of 
differences in background, and these differ-
ences obstruct an otherwise open channel of 
communication. Furthermore, as is the case 
with many minority groups, Asian Ameri-
cans feel pressure co dace within their own 
race. Another complexity, one that is purely 
physical, is height disadvantage. Men feel 
extremely insecure about approaching taller 
women for fear they will not be taken seri-
ously. Isaac believes that the only solution to 
such a situation is first co build a base of 
friendship. He says, "You watch movies 
where the woman goes through all these 
relationships, chen all of a sudden she goes 
to her best friend co cry. And that's the one, 
you know, that's the Asian guy! He's sitting 
in the backdrops, he's backstage. And she 
keeps going on stage and coming off until 
finally she's like, 'Oh, there's a guy back 
here!' And that's when you can maybe date 
her." 


A 
new setting: fall 1997, in Gene 
Huang's suite in Silliman. Fair 
amounts of pot and beer are passed 
around for the proudly "alternative" crowd 
at Gene's raging party. He stands near the 
keg, shjrc off, as is expected of him, feeling 
empowered and in charge in his role as 
nexus of the large crew around him. A cou-
ple of guys start screwing around, freaking 
each other to tease the crowd. Never to be 
outdone, always ready co outdo, 'Gene and 
his roommate imitate the guys and soon 
become the center of attention as planned. 
Responding to the excited hoots and claps, 
Gene gives them a show. Grabbing his 
roommate, he sucks his neck until a swelled 
red mark is visible. Gene is satisfied. Angrily, 
the roommate frees himself and vengefully 
reciprocates. 


Talking later, Gene thoughtfully scratch-
es his eyebrow-the one without the silver 
hoop-with his thumb, his cigarette sus-
pended between two fingers. "The social 
image I've set up for myself is one which is 
consciously, actively trying to escape the fact 
that I am Asian American. That label doesn't 
make any sense to who I am. I'm kind of 
oversexed and it doesn't make any sense to 
be really repressed about it," he says. 


Gene's Korean heritage has affected his 
overall identity, specifically his sexuality, 
because he has consciously defined himself 
as not typically Asian. During hjs junior year 
of high school in Minneapolis, he experi-
enced an abrupt transition from being an 
outsider Asian nerd to the big man on cam-
pus. Marked simply by a physical change, 
the way he was perceived eventually caused a 
change in attitude to follow suit. 


Isaac embraces the opposite end of the 
spectrum with the same vehemence but 
without Gene's performative tendencies. Pri-
vate, grounded, and friendly, Isaac feels that 
sex and sexuality are superfluous to the parts 
of his life that really matter. In his easy, mat-
ter-of-fact way of speaking that simultane-
ously puts the listener at ease and on guard, 
he says, ''I'm less willing to be vocal about 
things, less forceful. My approach to sexuali-
ty is not like the typical male sexuality. Who 
aspires to that anyway? None of it sounds 
very good to me." 


The most important aspect of defining 
sexuality in relation to race is reconciliation. 
Both Bert Chan and Eugene Auh seem to 
have achieved a peaceful balance between 
dealing with their "issues" and being sexual-
ly active within relationships. Each person 
works toward or against this balance in his 
own specific way. 


"If you consciously work against the 
stereotypes, you won't be associated with 
them anymore," Gene Huang says, some-
what disturbed by this fact. "But that doesn't 
mean I don't love those pictures of me as a 
nerdy little kid!"
