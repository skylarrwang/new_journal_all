The laws of Shomer Negiah, which Chavi also practices, seem to 
demand even more of her. In English, Shomer Negiah means "keeping 
the touch," and if one is strictly observant, touching a member of the 
opposite sex is forbidden until marriage. Its tenets of modesty even affecr 
the way a practicing member chooses to dress-Chavi will wear pants but 
not shorts. 

"There are women who won't wear pants. There are women who will 
~shorts but not shon-shorts and there are women who take it merely 
as a method of thinking about your selfhood and your relationship to 
other people in the world," she says. "To whatever extent, you try to 
make your physicality a precious thing, a rare thing." 

Is Yale a difficult place to practice her beliefs? Again, Chavi sees more 
than one side to this question. ''Yale is amazing for Jews and Yale is also 
very hard for Jews. It's hard to be observant here, but it's also one of the 
things I'm proudest o£ And I'm also very glad that I've done it because it 
gave my Yale experience a dimensionality that it wouldn't have had other-
wise." Although Chavi says that people are more curious than judgmental 
about her beliefs, she worries that many people do not see how the tenets 
ofShomer Negiah can mesh with the realities oflife in the 1990s. 

"The people we're talking about here are clearly people who go to a 
university, who can deal with things like Biblical criticism, who can deal 
with things like having condom ads," she says, speaking of herself and 
other devoudy religious students. "We can deal with a lot of things and 
we have a connecrion to religion that is not always traditional." 

For insrance, Chavi sees a dear link between the stringent laws of 
FEBRUARY 13, 1998 
Shomer Negiah and her feminism, noting that both Shomer Negiah and 
feminism reveal an intimate connection between a woman's body and her 
mind. "That is a connection that is often ignored," she says. "And I see a 
lot of women and also men who are harmed. They tend to forget that 
what they do with their bodies really does affecr their minds." For Chavi, 
keeping the touch is a day-to-day gesture of respecr for the mind as well 
as for the body. 

Chavi's comfon level at Yale seems to a great extent, to stem from her 
own ability to see things from multiple angles. She attributes this sensitiv-
ity to her membership in a community of people whose priorities match 
her own. Chavi says she's been lucky: "There are people who've had really 
shocking experiences and then there are people who've had really 
mediocre ones, and then there are people who've had really amazing 
ones-you know, what Yale's supposed to be all about: sharing of cul-
tures, sharing of ideas. That happens, and that's happened to me a lot." 

She also emphasizes that her Faith does not require her to proselytize. 
"I don't tell people how to act. If there are friends of mine who are in sup-
portive relationship and it's hard on them to remain abstinent I think that 
perhaps they should have sex. That's healthy. That's not conventional 
onhodoxy, but I'm a big believer in health of mind, soul, and body." 

Yale offers a wide range of health and counseling to suppon students' 
mental and physical well-being. In particular, Consent, 'Walden, and 
Pathways focus specifically on sexuality as it penains to homosexuality, 
sexual assault, harassment, AIDS, and STDs. Ar. the moment, however, 
there is no suppon or outreach group specifically for abstinent students. 

The University chaplain's office, which offers interfaith counseling ser-
vices to students, is one option for Yalies attempting to reconcile their

religious beliefs with the university's social cli-
mate. Associate Chaplain Reverend Cynthia 
Terry mentions that sitting down to talk with 
someone, perhaps a counselor or other respect-
ed adult, can help clarify what a student really. 
wants or believes. 

"I would ask the srudent some questions 
about their beliefs: what their own personal val-
ues are, both about sex and about their reli-
gious traditions. Is there a high value placed on 
the practice of religious values, regardless of 
agreement with the belief? Is there an emphasis 
on making an informed decision based on per-
sonal values? Mostly, I would want to help a 
srudent feel that there really is a decision to be 
made either to have sex or not to have it. My 
approach is not to uphold a particular religious 
principle or teaching, but instead to help stu-
dents identify the values and principles by 
which they want to live their life." 

Of course, the prospect of talking about 
one's sex life with an adult can seem as difficult 
as one's initial concerns. When Sarah Oelker's 
boyfriend and friends challenged her religious 
beliefs during her freshman year, she found 
herself reluctant to speak with an authority fig-
ure about it. "I've never felt like broaching the 
subject," she says. "I guess I'm very afraid of 
just getting told flatly, 'No, you are expected to 
not participate in that activity and that activity 
is a great sin and you're in big trouble."' 

While Sarah does believe there are very 
good reasons to abstain from sex until mar-
riage, she says that at this point in her life these 
reasons are more practical than religious. "Sex 
adds a level of seriousness, especially if you've 
been raised to take it seriously. If you're going 
out with someone and you decide you're going 
to have sex with them, you become emotionally 
32 
attached," she says. "It's probably going to be 
emotionally easier for you if you don't." 

Sarah was raised in a Catholic household 
where she was expected to be abstinent. She 
even had trouble uttering the words for geni-
talia when she got involved with her first seri-
ous boyfriend during her freshman year. This 
relationship was the only one so far in her life 
that has involved sex. Ultimately, she says, it 
was a positive experience. 

"We started having more serious discus-
sions about having sex, and I developed the 
ability to say, 1\ll right, I am uncomfortable 
with ·this.' I was kind of timid in a lot of ways 
and had not dated in high school, and I 
remember being kind of afraid when I realized 
that here's this guy who wants to be involved 
with me. That kind of made me sit back and 
look at it and say 'Okay, what do I believe?"' 

According to Professor Susan Brandon, 
who teaches The Psychobiology of Sex, 
"unthoughtful" sexual behavior is defined as 
"outside of relationships and without the use of 
contraceptives or protection." In addition to 
being thoughtful about the commitment level 
of her partner and the necessary methods to 
avoid pregnancy and disease, Sarah needed to 
do some serious thinking about whether or not 
she believed pre-marital sex is a mortal sin. 

Stealing and lying were always very cut-
and-dry things that one simply was not sup-
posed to do, Sarah says. When it came to sex, 
however, the issue seemed less clear. Her 
boyfriend, who had been raised in a secular 
household and had no such stigmas attached to 
sex, actively challenged her belie&. A friend of 
Sarah's had spoken to a priest before who said 
that pre-marital sex was not intrinsically bad, 
but something you needed to think about and 
do responsibly. Sarah was strongly divided. 

"I was saying, I feel these urges and I'm 
being told that they're wrong and that's driving 
me up a wall. I feel like I'm not going to be sat-
isfied with the outcome either way. One way, 
I'm kind of fighting back a lot of things that I 
feel so strongly attracted to. And the other way, 
I feel like I'm deserting ideas and guidelines 
that I was raised with." 

Finally, Sarah chose to have sex. Although 
she says she is disturbed by how blindly she 
went into it, looking back on it she thinks she 
needed to see that an experience she had been 
so afraid of for so long was not necessarily 
goingJo be a horrible experience. 

Sarah does not recall worrying specifically 
about how having had sex was going to affect 
the fate of her soul. However, she is sometimes 
afraid to be frank with other people about her 
expenence. 

"The most trouble was the time my mom 
and I got on the topic during a lunch conversa-
tion. I was not willing to tell her I'd been sexu-
ally involved with someone. And she's lecturing 
me on how much of a mixed blessing birth 
control is. I can remember listening to her be 
negative about it and thinking I feel like crap 
" because this is kind of closing the barn door 
after the horse is stolen." 

Sarah worries that her conservative Christ-
ian friends will think less of her for having sex, 
and she is not always comfortable with being 
identified as someone who's "in the know." 
While talking to one such friend who had spe-
cific mechanical questions about sex, Sarah 
experienced an awkward moment. "She actual-
ly didn't completely understand what sex was. 
She asked, 'Does it really work like this?,' and 
gave me an example. And I said, yeah, it really 
works like that. And it was kind of creepy to 
me because she was a conservative Christian, 
and I had been raised Christian and she was 
coming to me as someone who knew." 

Although it was not an easy decision for 
her to make, Sarah believes her choice was the 
right one for her. She also says that, although 
she has not been going to church on a regular 
basis recently, she is still very interested in being 
a Catholic. "I can't say, 'Bless me Father I have 
sinned. I've had sex with this guy and I'm 
sorry.' I'm not sorry. That constirutes a prob-
lem." But she believes that the issue of whether 
you have sex or not isn't the main point of reli-
gion. It's about caring for other people. Sarah 
says that at the root of it, she is Catholic
