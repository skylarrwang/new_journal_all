Naughty and the Nice

Desire. Consumption. Dissatisfaction. Sex and food at Yale. Take 
for example pork, which you might already know as "the other white 
meat," but perhaps had forgotten may function as slang for makin' 
whoopee, grindin', or doin' the nasty (i.e. "We pocked for 0-5 min-
utes and we both came"). Approaching the average Yalie, we might 
assume that he or she has probably consumed lettuce, french fries, 
vegetable barley soup, and maybe blueberry pancakes. But, have you 
tasted a breaded porkchop? We have no idea. But we do know 
whether or not you have pocked, and even whether you liked it. 
Yale students do have sex. Not all of them (thank God), but 
57.1 percent of the undergraduates have engaged in penetrative 
intercourse {ouch). But bear in mind, the other 42.9 percent are not 
necessarily keepin' their blue-jeans clean. Of this 42.9 percent of 
students not engaging in intercourse, 48.0 percent are having oral 
sex, while 33.0 percent are manually stimulating one another. Fifty 
percent of the non-virgin women lost their virginity before coming 
to Yale, whereas 65.4 percent of the men who have lost it," lost it 
before college (Figure 1). In response to our question, "Were you a 
virgin when you came to Yale?" one particular man, so assured of 
his pre-collegiate prowess, took it upon himself to rewrite our poll's 
simple "no" as "not even close," although he was only deflowered at 
the (gasp) shockingly innocent age of 17. The same boy (we hardly 
think him a man, despite his Marky Mark stance) answered our 
"Have you had sex?" question with yet another personal touch: 
"Yes, a lot," though he has only had sex one time this year. 


While this boasting was most common among male respon-
dents, women also surprised us with gender-specific quirks. Of the 
virgins, 2.4 percent used pink pens, while 3.8 percent of non-vir-
gins employed this feminine hue. None of the men used colored 
writing utensils. Ever. What's up with the girlie ink, ladies? 
And since we're in an interrogative mode, what's up with the 
fake orgasms? Of non-virgins polled, 63.5 percent of the women 
had at some point faked an orgasm, in contrast with only 13.5 per-
cent of the men. Faking may seem like a harmless prank, but realize 
that it only fuels the foolishness of youngsters like the respondent 
above. And what's up with the fake male orgasms? Asked one 
sophomore: "How the fuck am I supposed to do that?" Well, pre-
tend that you're a tired little porker, even though you could make 
another trip to the trough. In the meantime, fellows beware, women 
who fake orgasms, and are left unsatisfied, might just search for the 
platonic form of their simulated pleasure in greener, moister, more 
delicious pastures (Figure 2). They serve pork most anywhere these 
days. (Okay, only three women-hardly a sufficient sample-said 
they always faked it. But hey, we're not doing a Gallup Poll and, 
besides, those two girls must be stopped.) 


A whopping 42.0 percent of the students polled claimed to have 
pulled the proverbial wool over his or her significant other's eyes 
while pullin' the pants off someone else. The question was simple: 
"Have you ever cheated on a significant other? a.yes b.no," but one 
morally self-conscious polygamist opted (as was quite popular in 
this survey) to supply her own answer: "c. Kind of, it was a long 
time ago" (Figure 3). We forgive you. Kind _oÂ£ Give us a couple of 
years. We need physical and temporal distance from this poll. I8J
