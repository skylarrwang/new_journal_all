Lorna Sarrel: 
A View from the 
Counselor's Chair 
As I walk in the door, Lorna Sarrel is handing me literature about sex at Yale. I begin to sit 
in a chair, but she stops me. She cells me that the chair is hers; the couch is for students. I want 
oo remind her that I am not a patient, but before I open my mouth she has picked up her pad 
and pen-"out of habit," she explains. I imagine Sarrel with a student in her office almost 30 
years ago. She sits in her chair with pen and paper ready. Her patient, clad in bellbottoms and 
a printed shirr, sits on the couch ready to receive the sex oounsdor's advice. I see the same scene 
repeated through the years. After a decade the bdlborrorns are tight jeans; ten }'eal$ after that, 
the printed shin is a flannd. Sarrel counseled students during the 1969 integration of women 
into Yale College, the sexual revolution of the 1970s, the oonservative swing of the 1980s, and 
the (so-far) undefined 1990s. She's seen the arrival of herpes and AIDS, the increased accep-
tance of homosexuality, the onset of the terms "date rape" and "sexual harassment." 

"We're a lot older and wiser as a society, a little sadder maybe, a little less romantic in $0m,e • ·· 
ways, about our ideas of sa," she says, thinking back on her three decades in Yale's Menpf 
Hygiene department of University Health Services. She and her husband, fdJow sex eounselor 
and gynecologist Dr. Philip Sarrel. carne to Yale in 1969. After co-teaching their course, Topics 
in Human Sexuality, to students at prominent institutions like Brown, Smith, and Amherst, 
the Sands brought their lecture to Yale in the spring of 1970. "The very first year we gave the 
course, 1,200 students signed up," she recalls. "The only place big enough to hold it was Bat--
tell Chapel. So we stood in the chapel talking about orgasms and penises-which was a very 
odd experience." They oontinued to teach the non-cm:l.it course oo Yale students for almost 25 
years. But over time, the number of students enrolled in the course gtew smaller and smaller. 
"The whole enterprise ran out of steam. The need fur information now is not as great as it 
once was." The last version of the course was offered five ~ago. 

After years of training and experience, including time spent in 1971 learning fiom Masttrs 
and Johnson-the sex: experts of the era-Sand understands the intricacies of changing sexu-
al attitudes. "One consequence of the sexual revolution was that fur people at Yale there was 
suddenly a pressure to be sexual. It was bad to be a virgin," she says. "That was the sexual rev~ 
olurion pendulum swinging too far." 

Indeed~ Yale, along with the help of the Sarrds, may have lent momentum to this shift in 
attitudes towards sex. Sex and tiM Yak Student, fur which the Sarrels were consultants, exempli-
fies Yale's progressive stance in the sexual revolution. The pamphlet was first printed in 1970 
using funds from the small fee fur their Human Sexuality course. It was written by the Student 
Committee on Human Sexuality, a Yale group remgni7.cd and approved by the university's 
administration. While today's freshmen are inundated with Jecrures and information on sex, 
the first distribution of Sex at Yak made the pages of TheN~ Y01i Tunes. In 1971, an expand-
ed version was published in paperback by Signet. The Stu4ent Guitle IQ Sex on Campus trum-
peted itself as, "'The first sex guide written by college students. for college students. about ool-
lege students." The campus version of the book became graphically explicit-the 1974 edition 
included photographs of people demonstrating how to put on a condom and insert a 
diaphragm. By the 1979 edition, the guide was toned down, the photographs repJaced by 
illustrations. "By the late 1970s, early 1980s, there was a swing back row.uds the more oonser~ 
vative petspcctive, which I think in some ways was good." Sand says, explaining dw one of 
the problems of the sexual revolution was that everyone thought they wa-c the only viigin left. 

It is obvious upon meeting Sand that she's spent many~ rdlccting upon all things~­
ual. She's very oomfonable with the subject. But does thinking about sex all the time lasen its 
allure? Sand puts it best, "My husband and I talk about sex • if it were mrn flaka."
