In cybersex, your partner is faceless, the props are a modem and a 
monitor. The lure of logging on to get off seems dubious. 

''You HAVE To GET A PICTURE INSIDE YOUR HEAD OF 
what you want before you do it," Kate advises me 
as we stroll purposefully into the computer cluster. 
Her directive is stern, but the mood is girly-giggly 
as we sit down at Macs to register for Yahoo!'s chat-line service. 
Our laughter becomes shrill when the Yahoo! server asks us to 
choose an online nickname. Mindful of the rather salacious pur-
pose of this wee-hour venture to Connecticut Hall, Kate tries to 
log on as "moist," but the computer retorts, matter-of-factly, 
"That user name already exists." "Cunning_linguist" has also been 
claimed by another Yahoo! patron, and Kate finally sQcceeds with 
"hotmoist." I'm turned down as both "Caligula" and "littleboots," · 
and must resign myself to the moniker "smallboots." The third 
member of our party, Rachel, succeeds on her first attempt as 
"reddy_2_whip." Tittering like seventh-graders, our eyes meet the 
quizzical stares of slump-shouldered freshmen laboring over their 
Thursday night OS papers. I'm momentarily chastened, but I see 
that Rachel has wasted no time getting down to business. A quick 
glance at her screen places her in the TeenSex chat room, where 
she has announced her arrival: "Hey there, I'm ready to whip and I 
wanna talk." 

It's our maiden voyage on the murky seas of online chat rooms 
in search of a poorly-charted island called "cybersex," a Bermuda 
triangle of sorts where boundaries are confused and eager libidos 
are often lost in the fog. 

"It's always been one of those words that didn't mean much to 
me," a computing assistant shrugged when I asked him for the 
lowdown on cybersex. "Do you mean porn sites on the web? Erot-
ic online chat? Sexual encounters with robots?" I wasn't sure 
myself, but though my destination was uncertain, I at least knew 
the exemplar for the person with whom I wanted to dock. He'd be 
the electronic equivalent of Jim from Nicholson Baker's homage 
to phone-sex, Vox-arch, hyper-literate, a little eccentric, drolly 
aware of the absurdity of the sexual situation but diving headlong 
into it all the same. The kind of guy who gets aroused by the 
sound of a Cacique catalog phone operator saying, "Yes, we have 
the pointelle tights in faun"; describes the expression on his face 
when he climaxes as a "Smurf grimace"; and delivers bon mots like 
"The idea of women looking down at their breasts drives me 
absolutely nutso." 

If Jim has indeed hung up his phone and bought himself a 
modem, he wasn't putting it to any use this night. Perhaps too 
anxious to begin my research, I follow the dubiously named "Mis-

taTwerp" into a private room, where he proves himself a frustrat-
ingly reticent cyberintimate. Here I am, itemizing each piece of 
spurned clothing and the manner of its removal and duly noting 
each changed position, and all MistaTwerp can rejoinder with is 
"Mmm ... very sexy." I give MistaTwerp the benefit of the doubt-
after aU, typing with one hand expends precious time and ener-
gy-and launch into a convoluted monologue employing a garter 
belt and an ironing board, but my reverie is abruptly broken with 
the following exchange. 

<MistaTwerp> you still there? 
<MistaTwerp leaves.> 
<MistaTwerp enters:> 
<MistaTwerp> you there? 
<smallboots> I didn't know you had left. I thought you 
were just being your quiet self. Where were we? _ 
<MistaTwerp> you sucking my cock. 
<smallboots leaves.> 

The problem here, of course, is twofold, deriving first from 
technical difficulties ("my computer is mesedup," MistaTwerp 
later apologizes) and second from sharply diverging ideas about 
what constitutes sexy sex. But as Kate later points out, there's lit-
tle that is titillating about these electronic encounters in the first 
place. "I write papers and do e-mail on my computer, and sud-
denly I'm giving some guy a blowjob," she scoffed. ''I'm reading, 
'My tongue is outlining your clit,' and it's not, and there's some-
thing so ridiculous and desperate and sad about that. It's not a 
legitimate sexual arena and I don't think it's socially legitimate 
either. I mean, how could you sustain a cybersex relationship-
how many variations can you do on 'my hand drifts down and I 
unbutton your pants'?" 


T
he answer to her question, of course, did not lie in a single 
field trip to a computing facility. Others find social and 
sexual validity in chat rooms where Kate does not. After 
engaging in cybersex over Internet Relay Chat (IRC), William, a 
junior, arranged to meet his partner in person, commencing an 
intimate relationship with her that lasted eight months. He has 
been a heavy user of IRC for two years, but i:he awkward nature of 
online love srilllingers. "Meeting online acquaintances in real life 
is really funny-it's still embarrassing," William said. "There's a 
stigma attached to it. It's seen as weird and nerdy and not just as

factoring in significant others of the flesh-and-

blood variety. "My boyfriend had this strange habit of going on IRC 
after every meal," recalled Jason, a senior. "He said he was surprised 
we'd gotten together because by that point he had given up ever meet-
ing people at Yale. He found the gay community self-selective, and he 
wasn't selected. IRC was like an underground way of connecting with 
people who maybe weren't comfortable with the social scene, who 
were interested in flirting or talking or just interested in sex. But after 
we started dating it was clear that his IRC habit was still sexually 
motivated." Rumors that his boyfriend had been unfaithful circulated 
back to Jason following their breakup, but he was troubled by the 
nature of his beau's IRC encounters in and of themselves. "I have no 
idea whether or not he arranged to have sex with anyone he met 
online. What bothered me was that I knew he was propositioning 
people and being sexually aggressive online, and it may have been a 
bluff, but it was still a matter of principle." 

Unfaithfulness by electronic proxy may be a phenomenon pecu-
liar to the Information Age, but the allure of no-name, no-strings-
attached sex is not. Still, true anonymity online seems more the 
exception than the rule. Several of Jason's friends who were also IRC 
frequenters were able to match a face with a log-on name and tell 
Jason about his lover's cybersexual opporrunism. And William was 
hesitant to give me too many intimate details about his online prac-
tices; as he said, "There is a discrete number of Yalies who do IRC, 
and if I said too much they would be able to piece together who I 
am." Which is to say, the lights in the chat room aren't as low as one 
might think. Even the routine warning that flashes on the screen so 
often during transit in Yahoo!-"Any information you may submit is 
insecure and could be accessed by a third party"--<:an seem like the 
bright glare of a policeman's flashlight shining in on teenagers parked 
at Inspiration Point. 

Just as jarring are the non sequiturs to which cyberlovers seem so 
prone to uttering in the heat of passion. Kate, easily the most cynical 
of my subjects, admits she was momentarily won over by "Cainscon-
science," who lured her into a private room on Yahoo! "He lays me 
down on the bed, he's kissing my calves, and then" -Kate's voice 
reaches an incredulous pitch-"he puts a pillow under the small of 
my back, so I'm extra-comfortable while he gives me head." Alas, the 
moment was then irretrievably lost. "And then he says, 'The view 
from here is great!'"
