**Talking Dirty**

"Hook up"-it's a phrase tossed about all the time at Yale, in the dining hall, during a Sunday night recap of the weekend's escapades, or as a juicy bit of gossip between roommates. Like many people, I rarely heard the term before coming to Yale. Growing up in suburban New Jersey, the expression for any measure of sexual contact was "to go with," as in "Sam and Sue are going with each other upstairs." Yet, after two years at Yale; the noun and verb "hook up" and all its grammatical variations have firmly entrenched themselves in my vocabulary. 

Where did this ubiquitous term originate, and what precisely does it mean? 

A search for "hook up" on the Internet proved fruitless, leading only to sites such as "Hook up Fishing Gear" and the bizarre-sounding, but apparently unrelated "Hook-it's World of Sex." I scanned Sterling's copious collection of slang dictionaries and found no definition for "hook up" approximating the usage we here at Yale are so familiar with. One 1993 dictionary of English idioms defined "to hook up" as "to attach something, to install something electrical or mechanical" while another 1995 volume explained that it means "to travel together." The most telling definition I encountered, however, was in the 1997 edition of the Dictionary of Contemporary Slang. In Australia, "to hook" means "to pick up a romantic partner." The dictionary traced the term back to 19th century Britain, where it meant "to obtain a potential marital partner," and cited the following line from a 1994 episode of a popular Australian television series: "When you hooked Darcy last night, did you sleep with her?" 

"When I was in junior high," laughs Ryan, an Arizona resident, "any two kids who did anything remotely physical were automatically deemed to be 'going out.'" Midwesterners Anita and Santosh and Southerners Dan and Lanna also used phrases and euphemisms such as "make out" or "get together" during their high school days. In a more graphic vein, Ben from Long Beach, California, recalled "get your fuck on" as the term of choice in his high school. I found exceptions to this general rule, especially among students hailing from nearby geographical areas-Karen from local Branford, Connecticut, and New Yorkers Dan and Eugene were all well-acquainted with the saying before coming to Yale. 

So what exactly does a "hook up" entail? James, from Virginia says, "'ve been using the phrase since I came here, and I still don't fully understand what it means. I think the ambiguity of the phrase is why it's so useful." As a way of describing, without getting uncomfortably specific, non-platonic encounters of questionable significance, "hook up" is quite the versatile term.

**Debunking the Stork**
**Author: Erica Wu**

My parents never told me about the birds and the bees. Maybe they were too shy, too inhibited, or simply too embarrassed, but for whatever reason, I never got the heart-to-heart about the facts of life. Instead, when I was 16, after I had already gone through two sex-ed classes, after years and years of hearing word-of-mouth sworn truths about sex, and after four years of religiously reading my Seventeen, and Cosmo, my mom opened the corner of her mouth and asked, "Do you know how babies are born?" Not sure if I should laugh or play innocent, I sat trying to retain my composure and finally answered, as quickly as I could, "Yes, don't worry about it." 

Others told me about books mysteriously appearing in their rooms, tooth-fairy style, followed by the "come talk to us with any questions" line from their parents. Always having been curious how authors could write about sex for children when most parents have so much difficulty even introducing the word into their kids' vocabulary, I went to scope out New Haven's offerings of kiddie sex lit. 

My favorite find was the bestselling Where Did I Come From? by Peter Mayle and illustrated by Arthur Robins. With helpful pneumonics such as "vagina (it rhymes with Carolina)" and "penis... (like peanuts without the 't')" peppered throughout, Where Did I Come From? seems an obvious classic. Tactfully tackling the difficult topic of sexual intercourse, Mayle proves to be a master of euphemism and circumlocution to make potentially racy terminology suitable for young children. Likening the primal thrusts of sex to "wriggling," the (hopefully) pleasurable friction caused by this wriggling to "tickling" and "itching," and the final throes of ecstasy to "a really big sneeze," Mayle succeeds in describing sex in an accessible and comprehensible way for kids. 

On the flipside, It's Perfectly Normal by Robie H. Harris, goes into specific detail about everything a young child might want to know about sex, and then some!, all with a liberal, progressive spin. Starting with a thorough discussion of sex as gender, sex as attraction and desire, and sex as intercourse, this book includes a chapter on heterosexuality and homosexuality early on. Drawings of a bemused boy and a sweet-faced girl explicitly masturbating (separately) accompany the chapter "Perfectly Normal: Masturbation." Some parents may find that their views don't agree with Harris's and some parents may find the book too advanced and detailed for the purpose of telling a child the simple facts of life. 

After seeing what sex lit for kids has to offer, I realize that not even a book simplifies the task of debunking the stork myth. Sex, a simple biological act of nature that everybody does, remains highly politicized-less an event than an issue that demands parents arm their children with what they consider the proper ammunition. It seems to me that the birds and the bees, who just do it, have it much easier.
