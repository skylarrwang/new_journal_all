O, What a Tangled Web ... 
He kissed me, then he kissed this other guy who I kissed last year. I don't kiss 
a lot of people. Maybe he tloes, but that's not the issue. 
It's more complex than that. I met him last year when he was going 
out with this guy, David, who he later broke up with. Then he hooked 
up with the boy that David would go out with the next semester, the 
boy who would be the rebound for the boy I broke up with early that 
January. But again that's only one side of the story, because he also 
hooked up with a boy whom I had dated .roonths before, but then so clid 
David, and so did the boy I broke up witli in January. 
These relationships, wh"en thought of abstractly-only a series of 
hes-seem elegant in the way they follow after each other, like beads 
strung on a necklace. But the effect is less attractive when connected to a 
list of names, a catalogue of faces that keep popping up at the corner of 
York and Elm, then at a party you clidn't really feel like going to anyway. 
So many of these relationships amount to only glances, a kiss in a crowd-
ed room, a phone number scribbled into a matchbook. .. The romantic 
interests of some of the gay men I know have ambulated within such 
tight constraints that constructing a map of their liaisons would be con-
fusing, even daunting, such a project ending with a spider's web of for-
mer hookups, traded ex-boyfriends. 
This web speaks to the fact that though there is not one unified gay 
community at Yale, there are networks of friends that date, even if it 
means they must impose on old loyalties. Recently, a graduate student I 
dated in the fall asked a friend of mine on a date. The graduate student 
had not been that special to me. I guess it didn't matter. But it was scill 
strange, because this friend had dated or hooked up with many of the 
same people I had in the past. He asked me for informacion about the 
grad student: he wanted to know if he was cool, why it had ended 
between him and me, whether he should consider going out with him, 
never voicing any concern as to how invasive his interest might..have 
been. At the time I clidn't think much of it either, because there are so 
few gay men at Yale, so few that I could potentially be interested in. But 
the more I think about these sorts of occurrences, the more I think 
about how they devalue the meaning of these relationships. How can a 
hook up even potentially mean anything when it is so weighted with his-
torical implication? Especially among friends who gossip, how can inti-
macy be attained in the midst of so much shared information? 
If you aren't thinking seriously about dating non-Yalies in New 
Haven, then you have to keep turning over the known possibilities, the 
names and faces of classmates you know to be gay. If you want to date a 
Yale man you are confronted, then, with a limited-so small its mem-
bers seem achingly countable-pool of possible dates. You meet some-
one, you might think he's attractive, then you find out he's gay, then you 
think about him again. This return, this reconsideration, is important. 
In this situation the possibility of something turns into the something 
itself. the person you might not have considered suddenly become the 
person you leave a party with. It's an enabling compromise--"You're 
here. You're queer. I'll get used to it." -but maybe it will tum into some-
thing amazing, and maybe it's okay that you hooked up with him last 
year and you both agreed that it wasn't working out. 
I'w seen him around for the last couple ofyears. I knew he was gay. Now I'm 
rta!Ly into him. What tlo you think about him?. 
A friend said this to me at a party not long ago. He was revisiting his 
catalog of faces. Maybe the first rime he'd seen this other guy he felt the 
sparks that people talk about. Maybe my friend was dating someone else
