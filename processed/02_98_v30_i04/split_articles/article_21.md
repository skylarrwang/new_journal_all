HE SETTING: A LOUD YET UNIMPOSING TECHNO BASS BEAT 
fills the comfortable off-campus apartment, the official 
new hub of MOCKA (Men of China Kick Ass) parties. 
Cigarette smoke dings to the slim-fitting black pants of 
attractive Asian American women, most of whom sip the "good" 
drinks, although some courageously chug beer with the men. A circle 
of men-with two self-consciously unself-conscious women in their 
midst-have assembled in the center of the room, replenishing their 
shot glasses with a fresh round of Goldschlager. 

On college campuses alcohol and sex are inextricably linked. In 
Asian American collegiate social circles, this relationship is particular-
ly relevant. Men and women scope each other out across the crowd. 
Silent observation is the modus operandi until alcohol can move 
them beyond timidity. 

MOCKA was formed by a group of Chinese American men in 
1995. Clara Soh (PC '99), enthusiastic participant in MOCKA fes-
tivities, says, "lr was just a bunch of guys who hung out together, 
who decided to make their social circle official-in a silly way." They 
almost incorporated a "W" into the acronym to formally include 
women in their drinking group, but the catchy name and chauvinis-
tic overtones were decidedly funnier to these men. 

MOCKA gets together once every few weeks with the ostensible 
purpose of drinking. Typically, male bonding is associated with 
images of a men's locker room stuffed with football players compar-

ing notes on who got play last night. But when referring to the Kore-
an American community at Yale, Eugene Auh says, "For Korean 
men, sex and sexuality are important. But really, Asian men don't talk 
to each other about sex." Whether it is an exceptional respect for pri-
vacy, personal insecurities, or a combination of the two, Asian Amer-
ican men within the "Asian scenes" do not explicitly discuss sex. 

"A lot of Asian American males feel like they have to measure up 
and that's a big issue," Auh says. "That's something that you really 
don't talk about, you know, you're self-conscious. There's a running 
perception that Asian men have small clicks and shit like that," 

The stereotype of the inadequate penis size of Asian men is a bru-
tal assault on the male ego within American society. In comparison to 
stereotypes of the hyper-sexualized African American man or the leg-
endary all-American, hairy-chested football player, the Asian Ameri-
can man is characterized by a smaller frame and stature. "Ninety-five 
percent of Asian boys are either fat or real skinny," Gene Huang (SM 
'98) says with a bittersweet, nostalgic smile. He, among others, 
admitted to being that short, pudgy Asian boy with a nerdy bowl 
haircut and a peculiar propensity for math. The legs that were 
exposed by his gym shorts were not nearly as hairy as those of the 
other guys in the class. 

At an early age, many Asian American men are aware of the 
American masculine ideal. They are also aware-intuitively, at 
least-of how they measure up to this ideaL They may not actively
