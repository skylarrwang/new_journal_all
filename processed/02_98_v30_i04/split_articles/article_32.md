then. Or maybe something changed about the boy in question. Maybe 
the boy had a new haircut or his conversation suddenly proved com-
pelling, or maybe the boy had put a note in my friend's bookbag, some-
thing to the effect of, "I had an amazing time talking to you last week-
end, maybe we could continue that conversation next Wednesday?" 
Maybe that bowled him over. Or maybe sensing the boundary of the 
possible reigned my friend in, made him consider what he had previous-
ly considered only in passing. 

Attractiveness in the gay community can be calculated much like a 
mathematical proof. Person X is attractive because Person X, Y, and Z 
are openly gay, and if we construct a relationship where X, Y, and Z, are 
compared, X wins. Person X is attractive because maybe X, Y, and Z are 
all there is right now. And even if person X isn't the ideal person to satis-
ry this equation, he's still person X, and he's attractive even if less than 
amazing in other respects, and then too, he's gay and both he and you 
know it. So that's one thing. 

At least there is that one important thing.

but, thm, that's sort of like college. It's not who you're hooking up with that 
mattn"s, just that you're hooking up. 

A TA told me that. So maybe this dosed-circuit of hook-ups is more 
a condition of college, of being at the tail-end of adolescence, than of 
being gay in particular. Since any college community is a confined one, 
and since the gay community is a small part of that confined communi-
ty, and since loosely-formulated groups of friends are even smaller than >

that, settling is bound to happen to a certain degree. The thought, "I ~ 
haven't hooked up in a year," becomes ammunition against any doubts :; 
you might have about the person you're flirting with while standing near

the pony keg. Everywhere you go there are the same people, the same ~ 
names, their interest in one another budding or wilting like so many list-

less flowers, motivated by tropisms rather than any true desire. Which is 
not to say that these aren't valid attractions, just that the exciting, all-
encompassing attractions one might expect to find exist in a pervasively ~ 
disinterested setting, couched in an historically intertwined hook-up ~ 
narrative. 
But is this situation actualiy a probkm? Should it bothtr those invoivt:d? 
This is the question I pose to myself. These friends who hook up with 
one another in spite of what has happened before, are they hurt by their 
own history? Does this siruation effect pain in the lives of those involved? 
I'm not really sure that it does. The situation doesn't seem to cause any real 
headaches, merely rurious bemusement. This messy configuration of 
entanglements isn't intrinsically a bad thing, because for the most part this 
history is cloaked in an understanding of adversity and a quiet respect for 
one another. And, though messy, these entanglements nonetheless contain 
something worth preserving. Because on the sidewalk in fiont of the 
Women's Center, or in line for packages at the post office they allow for it 
to happen. Despite all the intertwining associations, the convoluted mess 
of history, these links allow the earth-shattering something erstwhile 
recounted by sonneteers to happen between twO men.
