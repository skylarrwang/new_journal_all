When Safe Isn't S~fe Enough 
K
IM AND HER BOYFRIEND KNEW HOW TO USE A 
condom. They had been in a seven-month 
monogamous relationship, and, like many col-
lege students, condoms were their contraception 
of choice. They never discussed, or even really considered, 
the possibility that Kim could get pregnant. They nev~r had 
unprotected sex. Pregnancy was not an issue. But late one 
night, Kim realized the condom broke. It seemed impossi-
ble at first; it seemed like the kind of accident that could 
only happen to other people. "When I found out rhÂ·e con-
dom broke, my boyfriend became really nervous. I was ner-
vous, too, but I didn't freak out because I had heard of the 
morning after pill. I called the emergency number at Health 
Services the next morning," Kim says. 


Kim's call was not an uncommon one at Yale University 
Health Services (YUHS). Several times a month, students 
call asking for emergency contraception. Through word-of-
mouth, the morning after pill has received quiet publicity 
on campus in the last few years. Student AIDS Educators 
reveal its existence to freshmen, and physicians mention it 
to women who receive contraception from YUHS. With its 
catchy name, the morning after pill sounds like the ultimate 
pregnancy prevention panacea. And, indeed, it is. Well, 
usually. Numbers reveal the limits of the morning after pill. 
When taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex, it is 75 
percent effective at preventing pregnancy. And, while 72 
hours allows for a substantial morning after, 75 percent 
effectiveness falls notably short of a guarantee. 


Kim was well within the 72-hour time frame when she 
called Urgent Care. YUHS responded immediately, and 
Kim met with a physician later that day. Her visit seemed to 
move right along until she learned of the morning after 
pill's 75 percent success rate. Kim found herself weighing 
the odds. In this high-stakes game of chance, the failure rate 
was 25 percent. "The possibility that the morning after pill 
might not work and that I might get pregnant was huge to 
me," Kim explains. Hours earlier, she had witnessed the 2 
to 12 percent failure rate of condoms. On any given day, 
without contraception, she had up to a 30 percent chance 
of becoming pregnant. The morning after pill decreases this 
chance, but introduces side effects including nausea. With 
no desire to conceive and few options, Kim chose to play 
the numbers and take the morning after pill. 


The vomiting started shortly after Kim's first dose and 
continued until the second and final dose 12 hours la,ter. 
Again, the odds were against Kim. Only 30 to 60 percent of 
women experience this side effect. Kim was quite conscious 
of the gravity of her situation. Feeling sick and alone, she 
regretted using only a condom. This accident forced her to 
recognize that contraception is more than just a necessary 
evil of sex. "I realized that sex really does have a cause and 
effect. And I realized that I alone was the one who would 
have to deal with that," Kim says. Within a day, sex 
changed from an integral part of a romantic relationship to 
an action with far-reaching consequences. 


T
hese consequences are best displayed in the waiting 
area of Obstetrics and Gynecology (OB/GYN) at 
YUHS. Chairs line a dimly lit corridor littered with 
subscription offers to American Baby. An endtable overflows 
with issues of Lamaze magazine, the copy of Preparing for 
Fatherhood peeks out from beneath them. Two pregnant 
women wait for their appointments. Amid the drone of flu-
orescent lights and muted conversations, boyfriends and 
husbands are scarce. 


One can easily imagine an anxiety-ridden college stu-
