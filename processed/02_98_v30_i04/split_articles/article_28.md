Spend a night at a New Haven strip club, but don't be surprised 
when you turn out to be just another face in the crowd. 

My friends gripped the heads of the heart-shaped 
lollipops wiclt their teeth and withdrew them simulta-
neously from the stripper's G-string guarded crotch. 
Between the hanging clouds from the smoke machine, 
the specks of light dancing about the disco ball, and the raucous 
screams of our fellow audience members, they had no choice but to 
cross the line. 

All night the mood of this place-Cleopatra's all-nude juice bar, 
133 Hamilton Street, a five-minute drive from Yale's central campus-
had been molding us to the demands of the stripping milieu. When 
featured dancer Colette DuPree shimmied out onto the glass bottom 
stage at 2 a.m., dressed as a latex wet nurse, we definitively slipped into 
our new selves. Perhaps it was something besides the smoke and lights? 
Perhaps, but probably not. We had all smoked too many cigarettes, 
but surely none of us was drunk enough to justify dangling dollar bills 
from our teeth, clapping for each dancer in turn, watching then leer-
ing at the strippers. And what was our excuse when Ms. DuPree placed 
four small pails of fluorescent paint on the lip of the stage, handing us 
each a paintbrush? What made us so readily take them from her hand 
and paint curlicues and circles, pictures and words on her thighs and 
calves, her belly and breasts? The transition from voyeur to viewer, 
kitsch-monger to participant took only two hours. 

Later, I asked one of the friends who took the trip: what made you 
do it, what made you grab that lollipop with your teeth? 
"I had to," my friend said, "I had no choice. All the men in the 
club were screaming. We became pan of her act." 

At the time, two days earlier, I would have agreed that it was the 
only way out. Ms. DuPree, legs akimbo and balanced at the edge of 
the stage, would probably have lain spread-eagle for a half-hour wait-
ing for her chosen ones to withdraw her showstopping lollipops. Away 
from the club and its attendant atmosphere of carefully orchestrated 
seediness, another possibility occurred to me. "Well, why didn't you 
just grab it with your hand?" I asked. "That would have defused it." 
"You know," my friend replied, "I never thought of that." 

But as students at one of the top universities in the world, aren't we 
programmed to think? Yes, we party, we play, we kiss, we drink, but 
34 
this is not how we define ourselves. We are workers, doers, and 
thinkers most of all. Or are we? Something between midnight and 2 
a.m. had turned us into one of the crowd. I walked into the strip club 
worried that the group I had assembled for the trip-a gay man, a 
straight one, two women friends-would get in the way of having an 
authentic good time. I thought the five of us would never be able to let 
go of our Yaletime demeanors, our varying degrees of straight-laced 
straight-facedness and brassy flirtation, our minds. Alone perhaps I 
could avoid the feelings of guilt and embarrassment one might feel 
while cheering for naked women, but with four dose friends? Maybe 
we would whoop it up for the ladies and have an ironic good time, but 
I never suspected it would cease being a game. I never suspected we 
would be just another duster of faces in the throng of testosterone-dri-
ven men. 

I 
drove co Cleopatra's with the admonition of another friend floating 
in the back of my head. A few hours before I was scheduled co 
leave, I got a message that Nicky had called. Initially, I tried to 
assemble my team from a seasoned group of nudie bar veterans, and 
Nicky's name had been recommended by more than one friend. "I've 
done the strip club thing five times, so I'm far from an expert," my 
friend Chris wrote to me in an e-mail. "I do, however, have a sugges-
tion for you: Nicky. When I went to a strip club with Nicky and a 
bunch of guys she was the only one to get hit on-by the strippers. 
Although she has many elements, the strip club is definitely one of her 
better ones. Get her to go. It promises excitement." Through the 
grapevine, Nicky learned about my little field trip and she wanted to 
give me some tips to avoid misrepresenting the strip dub scene. Curi-
ous, I called back. 
"Hey Nicky," I said, "You called?" 
"I heard you're writing an article about strip clubs," she said. 
"Yeah, I am. I'm told you think I'm going to fuck it up." 
"It's not that. But it seems that every year all the Yale publications 
send our their writers to do a disbelieving story on strip clubs. 
Inevitably the writer writes about how boring it was, how little they 
were aroused ... "

"Don't worry, Nicky," I said. 
''I'm going to try and get aroused." 
"That's fine and good. I just 
wanted to give you a few hints." 
I was intrigued. "Like what." 
"The important thing to 
remember is that at a strip club 
you don't matter. When people go to the 
clubs for the first time they're often too self-conscious 
about who they are. They're afraid that they'll be noticed or that 
somehow they are going to embarrass themselves. The key is no one 
cares. The dancers have seen it all before. To them everyone in there is 
just another guy, just another pig, and none of them care what any of 
you want. No one gives a shit. Just have fun and blend in." 

C
ertainly it wouldn't be that easy. By nature, Yalies overintellec-
tualize. In the classroom discussion focuses on representations, 
models, theories, and almost never practice. We don't just read 
novels to enjoy them; we consider where they fit in, how they operate. 
Enjoyment-what we like--often goes undiscussed. Beyond that, part 
and parcel of the Yale lore passed from upperclassman to freshman 
every year is the idea that we are sexless, or at least neutered by our 
intellect. The undersexed Yalie is part of the Old Blue myth. 

When we each forked over $10 to the men at the door, when we 
took our seats at the back of the club, it seemed the magic of actually 
being there might never happen. We sat in one row, leaned against the 
wall, knowingly smirking and wondering just where we fit in among 
the 40-odd men in the clul>-marines on shoreleave, homeboys in 
hoodies, an essentially undifferentiated, but universally goofy, hyper-
masculine crop. Nicky was already there with her boyfriend in tow, 
ready to chastise. "I thought you'd never make it," she said. "We've 
been here for over an hour." 

Soon enough our group split up and we scattered ourselves 
throughout the room. Still near the back of the club, I took my place 
less than three feet from a man enjoying a lap dance-the stripper 
whispering suggestive babytalk in his ear, a smile on his face. I felt a 
barrier between us greater than the 
three feet of physical space that sepa-
rated him from me. I thought of this 
wall, then looked at the walls-televi-
sion screens playing video afrer video 
of swaggering hip hop, then cool 
Eurodisco, then Billy Ray Cyrus singing 
about his "Achy Breaky Heart." 

Unaroused but curious, I moved to 
the lip of the stage and sat between two of 
the marines. I held onto my notebook and 
kept writing and smoking cigarettes. An 
Asian girl announced as "Kia" took the stage, and the marine next to 
me growled, "Fuzzy underwear. I love it." Kia awkwardly removed her 
fuzzy briefs, and I noticed dog tags slapping against her bare chest, 
jostling juxtapositions in my mind I'd prefer not to make. An African 
American girl named Ebony followed Kia, then a caucasian girl, Dawn 
(my friend later dubbed her "the white trash fantasy"). The women 
were all caricatures-Dawn chewed her gum and wore a fiannel slip, 
Ebony unenthusiastically slapped her ass as a ritual to bring in tips, 
Kia had her dog tags. 

Half an hour later, my friends and I again lined up in a row, this 
time at the edge of the stage. Over the ceaseless music and the inter-
ruptions of the club's announcer-"In 15 minutes, our featured 
dancer, Colette DuPree. Come on boys, look alive!"-we discussed 
why some of the women were sexy and why some of them were not. 
"It's exoticization," one friend said. "Notice the guys just don't give it 
up the same way for the white girls. They've seen too much of that on 
television and in fashion magazines." 

Occasionally one of us would announce how little fun the club 
was, but over time these objections became less and less insistent .. I 
handed out dollars to my friends in an effort ro follow the rituals of 
the place. A few enthusiastically passed out their bills, but two of my 
friends waited. "They have to impress us fuse," one of them explained. 

At 2 a.m. we made our preparations to leave after one more song. 
Then Ms. DuPree came out, the latex wet nurse. Our jaws dropped,
