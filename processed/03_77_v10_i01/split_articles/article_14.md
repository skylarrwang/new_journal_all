American Master Drawings 
American Master Drawings and 
Watercolors, by Theodore E. 
Stebbins, Jr. (with the assistance of 
John Caldwell and Carol Troyen) was 
commissioned by the Drawing Society 
to present a survey of American 
draftsmanship from 1564 to the 
present. A major exhibition of 
American drawings, based on the 
book and sponsored by The 
American Federation of Arts, has 
travelled to the Minneapolis Institute 
of Arts, The Whitney Museum of 
American Art, and is currently on 
view in San Francisco at the 
California Palace of the Legion of 
Honor. 

A selection of illustrations from the 
book iodi~s its scope. Drawings 
have been made throughout American 
history, from early notations such as 
John White's A Warrior of Florida to 
expressive works such as Untitled 
Number II by the contemporary 
sculptor, David Smith. Folk and 
country artists are represented by 
such works as the Shaker drawing 
The Tree of light, an interesting 
contrast to sophisticated drawings 
such as John La Farge's Dawn 
Comes on the Edge of Night. Mr. 
Stebbins explores in careful detail the 
varying techniques and differing 
purposes of the artists. This can 
readily be seen in a comparison of 
two masterly landscape drawings: the 
quick study of Niagara Falls from the 
Canadian Side by Frederic Edwin 
Church and the painstakingly finished 
image, Twilight, Plum Island River, 
by his contemporary Martin Johnson 
Head e. 

Watercolors is a pleasure. Hand-
somely designed and printed, it 
explores, for the first time, the rich 
and continuous tradition of American 
draftsmanship.
