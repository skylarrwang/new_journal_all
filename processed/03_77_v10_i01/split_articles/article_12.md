VISITING DAY 
Cara Geisler was enjoying herself. 
Not that the county music and arts 
camp didn't have its drawbacks: the 
camp bordered on a vast garbage 
dump, from which there arose, during 
the humid nights, an awful stench, 
and constant clouds of gnats and 
mosquitoes. The cabins were 
draughty, oddly off-balance, insect-
ridden; and Capraro, Cara's art 
teacher, was an unkempt, offensive 
middle-aged man, whose wife trotted 
around the camp in brassy bleached 
hair and gold lame peddle-pushers. 

Capraro had taken a strong liking to 
two girls from Cara's cabin, best 
friends, whom she considered 
immature. Their work was infantile-
they openly, and rather proudly, 
admitted to having auditioned for the 
camp using portfolios done by their 
high school art teacher-but, Cara 
thought bitterly, that was probably 
the key to the charm it held for 
Capraro: it was "primitive." On the 
other hand, if you had any real talent, 
and you dared to show it, Capraro 
would promptly and eagerly rework 
what you had done until it was barely 
recognizable. Not a single sketch or 
painting of Cara's had been left 
untouched. She had vowed to hide as 
much of her future work as possible 
from the sharp, jealous eyes of 
Capraro. 

No, it was not the camp itself that 
was at the root of Cara's-more than 
pleasure-elation. She felt freer 
somehow than she had ever felt in her 
life. Although the camp administra-
tion's readiness to ignore its own 
vestigial rules undoubtedly contrib-
uted to this feeling, it had a more 
basic, inadmissible cause: Cara was 
away from her parents. 

It had been two weeks since the 
first day of camp-two weeks since 
Cara had last seen her parents-and 
this third Sunday of the camp season 
was visiting day. Cara had arranged 
her voluminous bedding as neatly as 
was possible on the thin, concave 
mattress of her bunk. She had spent a 
good part of the morning trying to 
give some order to the mass of 
clothes in her trunk, which she now 
opened repeatedly, nervously, as if 
she expected the clothes to have 
somehow jumbled together again. 

Worse, she was haunted by a dis-
turbing incident that had occurred in 
the past week: one night, as though 
they had convened somewhere 
without her and planned it, the eleven 
other girls in Cara's room had gotten 
unanimously hysterical. They sobbed 
and sobbed-even, Cara noted with 
detached amazement, those girls who 
were the most outspoken in 
denouncing their parents. 

Of course it was contagious. But 
when Cara at last joined in, she cried 
for a different reason from that of the 
other girls. She cried because she was 
not homesick; and surely there was 
something terribly wrong with a 
thirteen-year-old girl, away from 
home for the first time in her life, 
who did not miss her parents at all. 

Then: in the cabin doorway, Mrs. 
Geisler stepped back abruptly, as if 
repulsed by a blast of foul air. She 
touched her husband's arm and her 
lips exclaimed silently: "Oh, Irwin!" 
"Didn't I tell you?" she said shrilly. 
"Didn't I tell you we'd find something 
like this? I knew it, I'm not 
surprised." She cast her eyes furiously 
about the room. "Just look at this-
will you just look at this place? It's a 
pigsty! Where's Cara?" 

Cara, sitting on her bed, directly in 
her mother's line of vision, was rigid 
with embarrassment. She was 
grinning. 
"Here. Hi!" she said in a voice that 
seemed to issue from the pit of her 
knotted stomach. Her only comfort, 
as she faced her mother's eloquent 
rage, was a spontaneous rush of 
irrational affection she suddenly felt 
for the two other girls in the room. 

They were still waiting for their 
parents and lay in their upper bunks 
reading paperbacks and chewing gum 
loudly, impassively. Neither was 
Cara's friend; neither gave any sign 
now that she acknowledged Cara's 
presence, or Mrs. Geisler's. But Cara 
in her desperation endowed them with 
qualities of understanding and 
compassion beyond those she would 
have expected in a good friend. 

Then, perhaps sensing that their 
mute, indifferent presence was 
somehow shielding Cara, Mrs. Geisler 
turned on the two. 
"You girls live like this?" she asked. 
The girls' eyes met. One mouthed 
the words "You bet!" and her friend 
giggled hysterically, nearly choking on 
her gum before she was able to 
control herself again. 
"Don't laugh at me, young lady!" 
Mrs. Geisler fumed. "This place is a 
disgrace- " 

But the rest of the speech was lost 
to Cara, as rivers of blood burst the 
frail walls of arteries and veins and 
flooded her ears. The next voice she 
heard clearly was her father's. 
"So," it said calmly--or maybe it 
just seemed that way, contrasted with 
her mother's. "How are things?" 
"Things are just fine," Cara 
managed to return flippantly. 
"Your sisters are outside," her 
father said. 

At this cue, Cara rose from the bed 
automatically and followed her 
parents, cautiously keeping her dis-
tance. She heard her mother say in a 
low, confidential voice: "Irwin, I don't 
want them to see that, inside there. 
I'm serious. It's a disgrace, the way 
she's living." When her father hissed, 
"Now you're being ridiculous, you're 
being stupid, Madeleine," Cara hoped 
wildly that this would be one of the 
times she could successfully ally 
herself with her father. She knew that 
he was often as impatient with and 
embarrassed by his wife as she was-
how could he not be? how could 
anyone in his right mind not be? Still, 
she had to be careful, had to watch 
and wait: there were other times, 
distressingly frequent and unpre-
dictable, when if Cara so much as 
glanced disapprovingly in her 
mother's direction-or if her father 
merely imagined that she had- he 
would slap her face with the hard 
back of his hand and force her to beg 
her mother's forgiveness. Those were 
his own words: "Now beg your 
mother's forgiveness! You don't look 
at your mother like that- hear me? 
That's the kind of treatment you 
deserve, not her, and you're going to 
get it. From now on, I swear you're 
going to get it ... " 

Cara stood blinking in the noon 
sunlight outside the cabin, dazed and 
disappointed. She was disappointed 
because the clear, perfect weather did 
not reflect the darkness and the 
turmoil into which she had been so 
suddenly thrust by her parents' visit. 
Her sisters, aged four and eight, eyed 
her wanly as Cara, unseeing, walked 
toward them. 
"Well, hi," Cara said finally. 
"Hi, Cara!" the little one piped 
immediately. She was an attractive 
child with great, long-lashed black 
eyes and shining straight dark hair. 
"Hi," the older girl said, still 
hesitant. She was tall for her age, thin 
and long-legged. Her thick, sun-
streaked brown hair fell loose from a 
ponytail in a stubborn halo about her 
narrow face. 

Cara too was tall for her age, and 
thin, but large-boned. Her massive 
growth of black hair, parted in the 
middle, was swept back over her ears 
and fastened at the nape of her neck 
with a barrette. Glints of metal 
showed through where her gold loop 
earrings were. She wore a too-long 
T-shirt and baggy green bell-
bottomed jeans and no shoes. Her 
arms and feet were covered with 
insect bites, some nearly healed and 
white with scar tissue, some scratched 
raw and oozing. 
"My God!" her mother gasped 
suddenly, noticing for the first time 
that Cara's feet were bare. "Look at 
those feet. Just look at them!" 

Cara obligingly studied her feet. 
"What have you been doing to 
yourself?" 
"I haven't been doing anything. 
Insects did that: mosquitoes, gnats, 
spiders of many varieties. They seem 
to have it in for me." 
"Go put on some shoes," Mr. 
Geisler ordered. 

Cara disappeared into the cabin 
and emerged again wearing pink 
rubber thong sandals. 
"Real shoes," her father said. "Put 
on your sneakers." 
"I can't. They hurt." 
"Well, maybe," Mrs. Geisler 
enjoined, "maybe if you had worn 
them in the first place you wouldn't 
have had this ... problem." She 
hesitated as if there were something 
unspeakably wrong with Cara's feet. 
"Did you ever think of that?" 

Cara shrugged. 
"Answer your mother," her father 
said sharply: he was not on her side 
after all. 
"No," she was forced to admit, 
annoyed and ashamed. 
"She has no common sense, Irwin," 
said her mother. "How many times 
have we said it? Oh, she's great in 
school, but when it comes to life- to 
living with people- I don't know, 
there's just nothing there." The 
woman sighed. "When is she going to 
learn?" 
"She's not," Mr. Geisler predicted 
grimly. "If she hasn't learned by now 
it's too late." 

"Irwin, we shouldn't have sent her. 
I knew this would happen." Mrs. 
Geisler shook her head slowly, 
thoughtfully. 
"What would happen?" Cara 
demanded. "Nothing's happened." 
"I'm warning you . . . " her mother 
said menacingly. She turned to her 
husband. "I tell you, after seeing this, 
I'm seriously considering taking her 
out of this place today. Seriously." 
"Seeing what?" Cara persisted 
bravely. "What?" 

But her parents seemed to have 
forgotten that she was there. Her 
sisters, meanwhile, had moved 
discreetly off to a spot some distance 
away, where the grass was sparse and 
the ground unusually soft because of 
the burrowing of moles. They 
shrieked with delight as the earth 
collapsed repeatedly beneath their 
sandaled feet. 
"We're not taking her out, 
Madeleine," Mr. Geisler was saying. 
"It's good for her. Let her get a little 
experience living in the real world for 
a change; let her see for herself that 
it's not going to be as easy 
everywhere as it is with us. Not 
everyone is going to take what we've 
taken from her. If she doesn't wake 
up now, then it's too late. She's old 
enough now." 

"I don't know," Mrs. Geisler said 
thoughtfully. "Maybe you're right." 
She turned at last to Cara: "Maybe 
after living like an animal for six 
weeks you'll appreciate your home a 
little more. Maybe you won't think 
your parents are so rotten." 

Cara failed to deny that she 
thought her parents were rotten. She 
had been through this scenario 
before: they would tell her that 
though they knew she was lying, they 
hoped, for her sake, that someday it 
would be true. Her father said, almost 
cheerfully: "I doubt it." 
"You're right," Mrs. Geisler agreed. 
"It's too much to expect, that our 
own daughter should love us." 

Cara felt as though her brain had 
turned to molten lead, and would at 
any moment come pouring out 
through her eyes. She heard her 
mother continue: 
"Come over here, let me look at 
your face." 

She went, automatically, and her 
mother studied her face as if she did 
not recognize her daughter-as if she 
were searching desperately for a 
familiar feature, a familiar curve of 
brow or cheek bone, a familiar pore. 
Then the woman grabbed at her arm. 
"I have to do your hairs," she said 
in a hot, sharp whisper against the 
side of Cara's face. 

Cara winced at the euphemism: 
"hairs" meant mustache, the shadow 
growth above her upper lip. Her 
mother would never use the word 
except when more than usually intent 
upon impressing Cara with the fact 
that she would be ugly, an object of 
ridicule, if the "hairs" were not 
regularly "done"-bleached. 
"I have to take her somewhere 
where we won't be seen." Mrs. Geisler 
explained to her husband. Cara was 
amused when he, visibly embarrassed, 
said: "I'll take the kids with me." At 
home, too, he was always em-
barrassed by the bleaching ritual, as if 
he could not bear to acknowledge this 
minor physical blemish of his 
daughter's. He was more comfortable 
in the face of what he considered the 
pervasive defects and deficiencies of 
her character. Whenever he saw Cara 
with the white bleaching cream drying 
above her lip, he would avert his eyes 
disgustedly and say: "Take that stuff 
off your face!" -before the twenty-or-
so minutes required to complete the 
process were up. So she would have 
to stay out of his sight. 
"You could go to the studio," Cara 
suggested now, helpfully, overcome in 
the face of her father's foible with the 
first tenderness she had felt all day. 
"Some of my work's there. You'll find 
it, it's signed." She and her parents 
had toured the camp the day they had 
brought her there. Her father would 
know how to find the studio: a dank, 
ill-lit, basement-like room in the back 
of the main building. 

He nodded-gratefully, Cara 
thought-and summoned her sisters 
with his hand. 
"We'll see you later," he said as he 
walked off with the two little girls. 
"Meet us at the studio, Madeleine." 
Cara heard the four-year-old ask: 
"What studio, Daddy?" Her father's 
answer- "The place where all your 
sister's artwork is kept"-filled her 
with pleasant, inexplicable pride. 
"Where can we go?" Mrs. Geisler 
nearly screamed, looking frantically 
around, as if convinced already that 
there was no spot on the camp 
grounds secluded enough for her 
purpose. The sound of her voice had 
jarred Cara back into her original 
hostility. The woman continued: 
"There must be somewhere-" 
"There is, there is, don't worry," 
Cara interrupted. She lowered her 
voice and said in mock romantic 
tones: "I know a place where we can 
be alone." 

Her mother remained stolidly 
unamused. 
"You watch out-you hear me?" 
she said. "I'm warning you, you're 
getting on my nerves today. You 
think I like to see you living like this? 
Like an animal?" She paused for a 
moment, and when she spoke again 
her voice had dropped an octave. 
"Where is it?" 
"Come on." 

Cara and her mother walked, 
unspeaking, up a half-obliterated dirt 
path that led past the stage: a painted 
wooden platform surrounded by a 
moat of gravel and a haphazard 
arrangement of bleachers. Behind 
them, on a vast mat of green and 
straw-colored grass, were spread the 
girls' cabins, the covered art patio, the
