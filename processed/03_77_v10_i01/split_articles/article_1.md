More freshman fraud
In the wake of the Andreas Alrea/
Patrick McDermitt hoax, a Yale
freshman has revealed to the New
Journal that her application for
admission to the university was also
fraudulent. Miggie Bonija, who
applied as the daughter of a Puerto-
Rican domestic residing in Spanish
Harlem, is really Linda Feineman, the
only child of an affluent Long Island
lawyer.

Linda explained her reasons for the
fraud. "All of my friends were
applying to Yale, and I realized that
the last thing the admissions office
would want to see was another
application from a Long Island JAP."
Linda confessed that she also forged
her S.A.T. scores. Her real scores
were 740 and 790, but with her
application she sent in scores of 400
and 460.

"I learned that the hard way. The
people at Harvard knew that my
application was fraudulent because
my scores were too high. They
reasoned that if I were that smart, I
wouldn't be that poor. After all, this
is America." The move paid off, and
Linda is attending Yale on a full
scholarship. She uses her book
allowance to purchase contraceptives
at the Yale Health Center.

Central to his application was
Linda's personal essay. She chose to
be novel: disdaining prose, she tried
her hand at ethnic poetry. As a result,
the Yale University Press has asked to
see more of her work. A book is in
the future. "I really felt that I knew
about the Puerto Rican experience.
I've had a lot of contact with them,
you know. When I went on my trip
to Europe, my father took me into
the city to a Spanish neighborhood,


to buy a set of matched luggage. It's
really cheap there, you know. I think
it might be hot," she confided.

Her essay-poem explores the pains
of inner-city dwelling and its
psychological effects:

Miggie Bonija's
Very upset;
She's sick and tired
of living in debt.
Tired of roaches
Tired of rats!
Whoa-ho, whoa-hoi


Yale Admissions officials have
refused to recognize the fraud.
Director Worth David was
unavailable for comment, but a
staffer who refused to be named said,
"Haven't we had enough embarrassment
for one year?''



**Title: Striking a blow against civilization at the Met**

Striking a blow
against civilization
at the Met
The Metropolitan Opera is well
known for its punctuality: the lights
had just begun to dim when I sat
down there at 8:29 on February 19.
But as the house darkened, a strange
odor filled the air. Suddenly a
middle-aged woman, struggling to
breathe, clutched my arm for support.
Within seconds my eyes seemed to
bleed tears of broken glass. My lungs
pulled taut in severe pain. My face
burned and my sinuses strained.

Around me, the many gasps for
breath became screams.

A group ran to the lobby exits and
opened the doors violently. A foul-
smelling gust of yellow haze burst
from the lobby into the theatre: we
were pushed back in. "Out the side
exits! The side exits! We've been
bombed with tear gas. Get out!!", an
usher cried. A handkerchief covering
his face muffled his words.

Ambulances, fire engines, and
caravans of police cars soon arrived.
The remarkable ventilation system of
the Met house managed to vacuum
out the theatre, leaving only vestiges
of the dusty yellow tear gas. Out of
their dedication to their art and their
audience, the extraordinary cast-
including Verrett and Crespin-
decided to go on with the opera after
a long hour's aeration.

The conductor and production were
given an ovation before the performance began. One moment in the
first act was of particular meaning for
the audience: speaking of the Paris
mob in times of strife and fear, the
heroine's father sings, "A mob in
panic speaks with a thousand eyes."
Despite the difficulty of singing and
playing instruments because of
remnants of the gas and constant
coughing of the audience, the production was a tremendous success.
The last few minutes of the opera
were so engrossing that I only
remembered the miserable opening
when I was on the subway.



**Title: Sensation Galore**
**Page number(s): 2, 15**

Violence galore?
The gaseous cloud moved slowly
through the audience. I could see row
after row jump successively from their
seats. They covered their eyes, noses,
and mouths in an attempt to breathe
without inhaling. Within seconds the
entire lower audience was standing.

A friend told me to come early to
get a good seat. I came on time. A
table with six untilled chairs, six filled
glasses of water and six microphones
faced an empty Silliman Common
Room.

Several people rushing to the aisles
fell to the floor, but others soon
helped them. The asbestos safety
curtain fell quickly, and cries were
heard from the orchestra pit. Metal
stands and chairs fell loudly.

One girl who had come from
Philadelphia to see the opera told me
what it had been like in the third
balcony.

"Up in the Family Circle we had no
idea what was happening. The
stench hadn't reached us until much
later- until it was too late. For a
while we thought Queen Elizabeth
or some VIP had entered- that is,
when everyone stood up and turned
around. But when the orchestra ran
out we all knew something was
wrong. A few seconds later, we too


The biggest sensation of
"SENSATION GALORE" was the
lack of sensation. The formal title (A
Discussion of Audience Appeal in
Entertainment Today) glossed over
the fact that the assembled group had
gathered to talk about movies. I
wondered how they were going to
discuss audience appeal in film
without discussing sex or violence. I
discuss sex and violence. I wanted
popcorn.

I shouldn't have wondered: in the
beginning of the discussion someone
pointed out that "sex is dirtier than
violence ... After that, the discussion
focused on violence.
