"I have no complaint against Yale 
students in general." he says. "What I 
resent is that they come in from the 
outside and tell the community 
residents what the community's 
problems are. 'It's the school, the 
mayor, the cops,' they say. They 
assume they know what our problems 
are because we live in a poor neigh-
borhood and they've read about the 
problems of poor neighborhoods in 
their books." 

From the point of view of 
extending the urban homesteading 
concept to other neighborhoods in the 
city, friction between Yale graduates 
and community residents constitutes 
only a minor problem. Before projects 
such as Ann Street spring up else-
where in the city, either the city or an 
outside funding source must agree to 
put up the resources that concentrated 
rehabilitation projects like the one on 
Ann Street require. Ann Street 
organizers consider outside sources a 
long shot at best. 

The city's attitude towards urban 
homesteading is certainly ambivalent. 
While Dawson and others at first 
credited Mayor Frank Logue with 
helping launch the Ann Street project, 
Logue's program of housing rehabili-
tation, Neighborhood Preservation, 
announced last September, almost 
explicitly excludes Ann Street-type 
projects. It sets grant limits of $5,000 
and loan limits of $10,000. The 
smallest loan on Ann Street was 
$16,675. 

The market value of houses on Ann 
street is under $15,000, yet home-
steaders have taken out loans of $20-
$25,000 to rehabilitate such homes. 
Their investment of time and money 
has made it evident that they consider 
Ann Street a permanent home. "I've 
spent a lot of long hours away from 
my family on this house,'' says Ann 
Smith. "My sweat, my family's sweat, 
and my roots are here. You better 
believe I plan to stay around." 

By contrast, the owners of houses 
slated for Neighborhood Preservation 
money have all chosen to get as much 
grant money as possible, making little 
or no effort to take out loans. In 
other words, not only are banks 
unwilling to invest in Neighborhood 
Preservation areas, but home-owners 
themselves are not even inclined to 
invest in their own houses. 

Except for foundations, other 
sources of funds such as banks have 
not contributed to the Ann Street 
project either, but through their labor 
residents won't have nearly the 
emotional stake in their neighbor-
hoods that homesteaders have. 

Finally, long-time residents of these 
neighborhoods will view newcomers 
as carpetbaggers who descend to 
snatch the spoils of work they them-
selves were uninvolved with. 

Incentive is the key. "The lesson of 
Ann Street," says Tony Dawson, "is 
that people who want to stay in a 
neighborhood and have a stake in it 
can improve it a lot-no matter how 
poor it is to start with." 

The fight in New Haven continues. 
During the first week of this January, 
the Board of Aldermen passed 
legislation calling for the establish-
ment of a nine-member board. 
Independent of the Redevelopment 
Agency, the new board will be 
empowered to enact urban home-
steading programs. Mayor Logue 
decides the level of funding and the 
membership of the board, testing his 
commitment to the concept. 

On Ann Street, progress continues. 
High school senior Tony Dawson 
As homesteaders move into their 
houses, become settled and raise 
families, they may lose some of their 
outspoken advocacy for urban home-
steading. Tony Dawson seems aware 
of this possibility. He has deliberately 
kept his own house on Ann Street 
unrehabilitated. "My house was the 
symbol that something was starting 
on Ann Street," he has said ... Now it's 
the symbol that what was started has 
yet to be finished."
