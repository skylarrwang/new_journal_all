Two years ago, New Haven's Ann 
Street on the Hill was ravaged and 
vacant. Street crime and crumbling 
housing had discouraged potential 
inhabitants. A third of the deteri-
orated one- and two-family homes 
were abandoned. Absentee landlords, 
bankers, private institutions, and 
government agencies had long since 
lost interest. They wrote off the street 
as a hopeless slum. 

In early 1975, an informal 
group of Ann Street residents- a 
remarkable high school sophomore 
named Tony Dawson, and two Yale 
graduates-embarked on a scheme of 
urban renewal that turned abandoned 
houses into resources instead of 
liabilities. The project suggests a 
strategy for urban renewal that 
dispenses with the conventional 
wisdom and that works. 
toHow. 

Under the so-called "urban home-
steading" legislation (enacted at the 
federal and state level but never tried 
in New Haven), potential homeowners 
could "buy" for one dollar vacant 
houses owned by HUD and turned 
over to the city. Sixteen-year-old 
Dawson took the first step by buying 
a house- not from HUD, but from 
Connecticut Housing Insurance, an 
organization that holds properties on 
which banks have foreclosed. Dawson 
then convinced the New Haven Board 
of Aldermen to ask HUD to turn the 
seven houses it owned on Ann Street 
over to the city, so the city could sell 
them to potential homesteaders. 

Over the next few months, seven 
sets of homesteaders, with jobs 
ranging from bus driver to research 
worker and mostly young married 
coup~. joined the effort. A major 
building project began. 

Ann Smith, one of the seven home-
steaders, says "The bouse we moved 
into was falling apart. Nobody had 
lived there for years. Vandals had long 
since ripped out plumbing and 
electrical equipment. In fact, they 
didn't leave much of anything." 

The priorities of the homesteaders 
became to: acquire tools; improve the 
security of the area so that the work 
of the day would not be plundered at 
night; and get enough money to 
accomplish what were, in many cases, 
total interior restorations. 

Yale contributed Sl,OOO to buy 
tools, but the security problem proved 
more difficult. As work began, some 
fulltime residents of the street were 
wary of the would-be homesteaders. 
Vandals poured gasoline from the 
rooftop of Dawson's bouse and lit it. 
The damage still shows, though the 
house bas not been hit since. The 
vandalism made the neighborhood 
more sympathetic to the home-
steaders. It went a long way toward 
encouraging a community security 
group known as NeighbQrhood 
Watch. 

This group bas managed to alter 
completely the crime pattern on the 
street. For example, a year and a half 
ago, a house on Ann Street was 
abandoned. Other residents and the 
homesteaders failed to convince the 
family in it to remain. Yet, in a city 
where vandalism invariably follows 
abandonment by less than a week, no 
one has vandalized or plundered the 
house since its tenant left. 

"Because of Neighborhood Watch," 
says Amus Stevens, a street resident, 
"there are people you can see and say 
bello to from noon to midnight." 

In a way, Neighborhood Watch was 
a natural outgrowth of the spirit the 
project bad fostered. Ann Smith 
notes, "We have really gotten into 
sharing. 'Why leave something in the 
basement if your neighbor can use it?' 
we all think. People will come around 
and ring my doorbell if they haven't 
seen me for a while." 

Coaxing money from foundations, 
and eventually from the New Haven 
Redevelopment Agency, required a 
different kind of ability. It was here 
that the Yale graduates brought their 
talents to bear. The Haymarket 
Foundation of Cambridge, Massa-
cbussets and the New Haven 
Redevelopment Agency have together 
contributed some $600,000 to the 
project, half in grants and half in 3% 
loans. 

Of all the problems the homesteaders 
faoed, the most serious was their 
relationship to Redevelopment. The 
major portion of the money they 
applied for came almost a year after 
they submitted their application. Red 
tape, which delayed payments to some 
contractors, skepticism on the part of 
Redevelopment officials about the 
project, and the officials' reluctance to 
give away power to private citizens 
very nearly destroyed the project. 

"Though they never came out and 
said it," Ann Smith recalls, "the 
Redevelopment officials seemed to 
think, 'Oh, this won't work and we're 
going to prove it.' " 

Most of the plumbers, carpenters, 
and laborers who are working on 
these houses are neighborhood 
residents or the homesteaders them-
selves. They comprise a core of about 
11 men, most of whom were untrained 
in construction skills before the 
project began. They have acquired 
most of the necessary skills through 
experience and from special help 
programs set up by the carpenters' 
union. Professionals are hired for very 
specialized tasks. 

People Acting for Change, as the 
original group came to be caUed, bas 
established a non-profit general 
The New Journal I March 1, 1977 
contractor called the Home Main-
tenance Center to help rehabilitate. 
The Center has cut normal fees by 
25%; it also has a tool-lending library 
for minor repairs. 

Of the ten original sets of home-
steaders, seven are in various stages of 
moving in or have already. The 
project now involves 13 houses. But 
the success of this project, at a time 
when most programs that try to 
benefit low income groups fail, is only 
one of its remarkable features. Even 
more remarkable is that Tony 
Dawson, the project's initiator, is still 
a high school student. 

Though his parents have only 
recently become politically active, 
Dawson began watching polls at 9. At 
10, he and a local pastor organized 
New Haven's first block association 
on nearby Ward Street. There are 
now about 17. At 16, he helped form 
People Acting for Change, partly to 
focus the efforts on Ann Street, partly 
as an umbrella organization for the 
block associations. 

On the way, be has picked up an 
award from the New Haven Police 
Department for fostering good 
relations between the police and 
private citizens. His latest project is to 
establish a student government at Lee 
High School. 

Dawson has definite theories about 
education. For one thing, he sees no 
reason why "Urban Studies classes 
should concentrate on Chicago instead 
of New Haven." He believes in the 
practical benefit from gearing courses 
to New Haven: "Knowledge replaces 
fear. If you don't know what's going 
on, you can't help with a project. 
Instead, you go and break windows." 

In the November, 1976 election, 
Dawson took charge of organizing his 
ward. A record 1900 residents voted. 
Even before this, Senator Weicker 
invited Dawson to spend a week in 
Washington to observe government at 
the Federal level. Governor Ella 
Grasso bas invited him to spend a 
week of his spring vacation looking 
over the state government. Two of his 
teachers as well as Dick Conrad, a 
Journal Courier reporter, have offered 
to help him write an autobiography. 
He plans to have completed his first 
draft by the end of the year. The 
usually cynical Conrad bas followed 
the Ann Street project closely. He 
says, "All I can say about the kid is 
that he is incredible. Not only has he 
gotten the Ann Street project under 
way, but he has prevented a war 
between People Acting for Change 
and the Hill Neighborhood Corpora-
tion that would have been disastrous 
to the area." 

Dawson bas recently become 
estranged from People Acting for 
Change because he feels Yalies have 
come to dominate it. He thinks it is 
absurd to support that white outsiders 
can organize black community 
residents better than other community 
residents. Moreover, he resents the 
Yalies' attitude towards community 
problems.
