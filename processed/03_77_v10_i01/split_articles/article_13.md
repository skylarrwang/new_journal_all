main building which was largely a 
mess hall, the flagpole. A gravel road 
led out of sight into the woods, to the 
other parts of the camp: the boys' and 
administrators' sections, the secluded 
dance studio, the rec hall, pool, tennis 
courts. The camp was located on a 
small peninsula; Cara and her mother 
wallced on a narrowing stretch of 
overgrown land toward its tip. They 
could see, directly ahead, the edge of 
the sheer, sandy drop the campers 
used to get down to the water. On 
either side the river was shielded from 
view by dense walls of the tangled, 
distorted trees that grew out in all 
directions from steep slopes. Cara led 
her mother finally to a solitary bench 
that faced the open end of the 
peninsula. Before they sat down, the 
woman patted her handbag and said 
in an oddly confidential voice, as if 
she were speaking about an illicit 
drug: "I have it right here." 


Cara noted with revulsion the 
flaccid, starkly pale spread of her 
mother's bare thighs on the weathered 
wood of the bench. Mrs. Geisler was 
a stocky woman only an inch or two 
taller than her daughter, wearing a 
short, navy-and-white cotton dress. 
Her mother had horrible legs, Cara 
thought; she had absolutely no 
ankles. She felt too that her own legs 
were an only slightly modified version 
of her mother's, so she always wore 
long pants, even in the hottest 
weather. She sat sullenly now while 
her mother fished around in her 
handbag for the drug- the bleach-
silently blaming her both for the sorry 
state of her legs and for making her 
so painfully conscious of their 
unattractiveness by bringing up the 
subject of yet another defect: the 
"hairs." 


Mrs. Geisler had found what she 
was looking for: a discreet, pale 
turquoise box with .. Jolen" inscribed 
on it in airy, feminine script, and "Lip 
Bleach" below that, in small print. 
The inaccuracy of this description 
angered Cara: it was not her lip that 
had to be bleached; it was the hairs-
the mustache!- above her lip. Raging 
inwardly, Cara watched as her 
mother, with the skilled air of a 
pharmacist, mixed the contents of the 
dainty tube of cream and a delicate 
vial of powder she had produced 
from the box. She spread the 
concoction with a tiny, spatula-
shaped stick onto a miniature pallet 
of white plastic- both also from the 
box. 
"Look at me," the woman 
commanded. 


Cara lifted and turned her head. 
Her mother applied the white cream 
with the spatula, spreading it expertly 
to cover all the hairs. A sharp smell 
bit into Cara's nostrils; she 
remembered that the writing on the 
box had also proclaimed Jolen's 
"New Rose-Scent." 


The stuff stung. Exaggerating her 
discomfort, as she always did- by 
moving her Hps as little as possible 
when she spoke, as if the cream were 
a great weight-Cara said petulantly: 
"It burns!" 


"That's only for the first few 
minutes," her mother said sagely. 


It was true- but how did she 
know? Cara wondered. She had never 
used- or needed- Jolen Lip Bleach. 
She must have read it in the 
instructions that came with the "kit," 
Cara finally decided. 


Mrs. Geisler leaned back, gazing 
with obvious satisfaction at Cara's 
face, as if it were a portrait she had 
just put the finishing touches on. 
Then, eagerly, she bent forwarct 
again. 


"Now, we'll just put a little here," 
she said as she smoothed cream over 
the little gap between Cara's rather 
heavy black eyebrows. "You need it 
here, too." 


Cara's face tensed and tingled with 
annoyance: that was something her 
mother said every time. In fact, the 
bleaching of the shadow between her 
eyebrows had always been so 
desultory a gesture on her mother's 
part that Cara did not even include it 
in her own conception of the "hairs." 


"Stop twitching!" Mrs. Geisler said. 
"That stuff cracks, and I'll have to do 
it over again." Her voice, if not her 
words, expressed the horror of a 
Michaelangelo watching her David 
threatened with an axe. 


• "Oh, never!' Cara blurted 
impulsively, forgetting even to keep 
her lips tight. 


The blood rose in Mrs. Geisler's 
face; she clenched her band around 
her daughter's exposed upper arm, 
thrusting her hot face close to the 
girrs. 


"You listen to me," she warned. 
"You just listen to me now, young 
lady. I don't like you today- you 
bear me? You think you're so great: 
well, you're not. That's what you have 
to learn, in order to live in the real 
world. People have to live in reality, 
not in a fantasy world, like you." The 
woman paused for a deep, slow 
breath. "Can you understand that?" 
she said as if she were talking to an 
idiot. 


Cara nodded, mesmerized more by 
the rhythm of the words than by their 
awful meaning. 


"Answer me." 


"Yes." 


Mrs. Geisler shook her head slowly, 
portentously. 


"I don't think so, Cara," she said. 
"I don't think you really do. I think 
you're lying." She waited for this to 
sink in- Cara did not deny it- before 
continuing grandly. "It's too much to 
expect, that you'll ever learn. I know 
it. Your father is right: if you haven't 
learned by now, it's too late. He's 
resigned himself to that-your own 
father. I don't know how he did it. I 
can't-I've tried to, God knows, but I 
can't, and that's that. I'm your 
mother, I can't let you be the way 
you are now-the way you've always 
been. You've always been this way, 
and it's no good." She appealed to 
Cara with small, inexpressive eyes, at 
the same time tightening her grip on 
the girl'§ arm. "It hurts me- it breaks 
my bean---an you understand 
that?- when I see you living like this, 
in filth. Filth! If it was up to me I 
would take you out today. But your 
father thinks it's good, maybe be's 
right, I don't know. I just don't know 
anymore." 


The hand holding Cara's arm 
relaxed, but the woman's broad face, 
drained now of color and oddly 
luminous, still hung as if disembodied 
inches from Cara's own. The woman 
was inhaling deeply and irregularly, 
dipping her head forward each time, 
her eyes half-closed. Cara had the 
sudden, terrible conviction that her 
mother was somehow drawing 
strength for another tirade from her 
own- Cara's- breath. She drew back 
in horror, gasping slightly and 
holding the burning air down inside 
her chest. When it burst forth seconds 
later, with a scalding rush, Cara 
heard herself whisper hoarselv: "No!" 


Mrs. Geisler roused herself at the 
sound, as if awakened by the snap of 
a hypnotist's fingers, and began to 
speak again as though she had never 
stopped. 


••1 only want the best for you, 
everything I do is for your own good, 
whether you know it or not," she said 
to the side of Cara's ashen face. "I 
didn't have to bring this"- she waved 
the little turquoise box-"but I 
thought maybe you'd appreciate it, 
realize I only wanted to help you. I 
didn't do it for my own sake, did I? 
But I see now that was too much to 
expect." The angry flush had returned 
to her cheeks. "Look at me!" she 
said, and peered intently at her 
daughter's face. 


Cara hated her mother now- hated 
the little eyes, hated the warmth 
which seemed to creep, sly and 
tentacled, toward her from her 
mother's body. She wanted to scream; 
she would have screamed, had the 
woman not said at that moment: "It's 
almost time to take if off," and 
reminded her of the precious cream 
drying stiff and caked above her lip. 


"I'll take it off now," Mrs. Geisler 
continued, taking a wet washcloth 
from the plastic bag she had, in tum, 
taken out of her handbag. "We have 
to meet your father," she added 
irrelevantly, daubing the bleached 
areas of Cara's face ungently. 


"Finished," she announced, with a 
sort of pride. 


Cara's skin felt raw where the 
cream had been, more exposed 
somehow than the rest of her face. 
She twitched her upper lip experi-
mentally, as if she doubted that it was 
still flexible. Her hatred had subsided

now, replaced by a bubble of hysteria 
that nearly burst when her mother 
said: 


"You have no idea how much 
better you look. I know you can't see 
yourself objectively-which you'll 
have to learn to do one of these 
days- but you were actually ugly 
before. A girl with a mustache is 
something people make fun of. Do 
you want them to make fun of you? 
Or would you rather I did this for 
you?" 




"Yes what?" 


"I'd rather you did this for me." 


"Well, then show it. Show a little 
appreciation for a change, that's all I 
ask. Is that too much for a mother to 
expect?" 


They were leaving, finally. But first 
they were going to take her picture. 
All right: she could stand that much 
more. 


Cara stood in front of the cabin, 
waiting for her father to return from 
the car with his camera, idly and 
absurdly trying to calculate the length 
of her family's visit from the position 
of the afternoon sun. Her sisters were 
playing on the molehills again; her 
mother stood nearby, scowling and 
shaking her head at nothing in 
particular- at the entire camp, 
perhaps, with its flurry of post-
visiting, pre-dinner life. 


Cara herself had lost all track of 
time soon after her parents' arrival; 
before that, the minutes had weighted 
the air with a palpable, languid 
presence. The events of the afternoon, 
following the bleaching ritual, had 
slipped past her memory unnoticed-
all except one, and it was this one 
alone that Cara desperately wanted to 
forget. The others, she was sure, had 
been innocuous enough. 


She had Hed, the tendency her 
parents always held up as ultimate 
proof of her inherent, ineluctable 
badness. The lie had not been 
premeditated; nor would it be dis-
covered. But it lent a prophetic aura 
to her parents' dismal assessment of 
the chance that Cara would "learn 
before it was too late." 


She and her mother had joined her 
father and sisters in the makeshift 
studio. The poor lighting and gray 
concrete walls of the small room 
made the paintings that were hung 
randomly or planted on easels in the 
corners stand out with a brightness 
that was almost malevolent. Looking 
around at the collected work of the 
campers, Cara noticed for the first 
time the remarkable consistency of 
many of the artists: the girl who 
painted nothing but seated, faceless 
women in eighteenth-century dress; 
the boy who worked endless 
variations on a mushroom-and-
spider's-web theme, in shades of 
orange and red. Then there was the 
work of Capraro's two favorites, 
amazingly similar: Modigliani-Iike, 
but artless, portraits of women--or 
girls, you couldn't tell which-with 
heart-shaped faces, pointed chins; 
~taring, lashless eyes outlined heavily 
in black; narrow, sloping shoulders.
