Notes from the People's Inaugural
by Aaron Belsky
It was the early morning of the
20th of January, 1977. A jet passed
overhead as Martin Luther King Sr.
took his place on a rostrum in front
of the massive statue of Abe Lincoln.
Five thousand people, mostly blacks,
stood on the steps in front of him.
"Little did I know, fourteen years
ago, that I would be standing here
again today,'' he said. "But God has
His ways of leading us and guiding
us."

King spoke to this eager crowd at
seven o'clock in the morning on the
first, freezing day of "a new era," to
preach the gospel of a new administration. He raised the crowd to
confused but loud choruses of "Praise
the Lord" and "I believe, I believe."
After each phrase they shouted his
theme, "Feed my sheep."

"Feed my sheep, the sheep must be
fed. This is what it is all about. That's
what Martin Luther King Jr. gave his
life for ... that the least of these may
never be forgotten. That's what the
president-elect is all about, that's why
he's up there, because he said that he
was concerned about the least of
these. I was hungry, and you fed me
not. I was in prison, and you didn't
visit me. I was sick, and you didn't
wait upon me. So God grant that our
president will remember always the
least of these." The people, along with
Leontyne Price and the Atlanta Boy's
Choir, shouted and praised the Lord
and sang Amazing Grace.

Standing in the first row with
cameras, microphones and note pads
all around me, I noticed Coretta King
in the front row. She sat next to
Andrew Young. CBS saw them too,
nailed them, and interviewed them
with the Washington Monument as a
backdrop. Cameras clicked away. But
all the clicking was overwhelmed by
the sound of five thousand people
singing and shouting.

It was perhaps the only moment
during the whole inaugural that
unified faith descended over one of
the large gatherings in the city, made
you believe that the political process
meant something. That dream of
fourteen years ago, voiced on the
same steps, seemed possible. The
crowd didn't care about the media.
They cared about the deliverance they
expected from a new president.

The only show of emotion I'd seen
before this had been in the office of
Senator Hubert Humphrey. Under
the countless decorations, portraits,
and memorabilia that adorned the
Senator's reception office, a
Minnesota woman sat crying. She
had thought her invitation to the
capital meant a nice seat at the
inauguration. She had supported
Carter, she had even helped out a
little at the local headquarters. Now
she couldn't even get onto the
grounds of the capitol, let alone get a
seat. The closest she could get to
Carter would be about half a mile-
or else six feet away from the
television screen set up in the office.
One of the secretaries was frantically
calling around for a prized blue ticket
to standing room on the capitol

When I left the office, the woman was
still sitting there, wiping her eyes and
clutching a Humphrey newsletter.

Outside, the capital had reached the
political apotheosis of its Bicentennial
madness. The exhibits were open
again. Mobs of historically-minded
citizens filled every nook in the
Smithsonian and every bed in every
hotel. Jimmy had told them all to
come and come they did, lifting their
white cowboy hats and greeting you
with a cheerful "Hi there, young
fella!" under the stately dome of the
Russell Office Building. The inhabitants of Plains, who had come up on
the specially-chartered "Peanut
Special" train, crashed in the lobby of
the Ambassador Hotel. They drank
Blackjack and cursed the bureaucrats.

The tour guides were working
overtime. Their fingers trembled as
they directed heads towards the
mighty dome of Congress. Two high
school girls, whose blonde hair was
tucked beneath bright red caps,
disregarded their tour leaders' antics
and practiced their steps for
tomorrow's parade on the steps of
Congress.

The taxi drivers took it all calmly,
cruising carefully past limousines and
official dark-green cars, cutting off
the rest of us. At peak hours there
was an hour wait for a cab. Only
Union Station seemed capable of
dealing with the masses.

The Visitor's Center, the former
main hall, never seemed to fill up.
The potted palms and landscaped
corners waited beneath the rhythm of
the brilliantly white Beaux-Arts
architecture. Stately Washington
could still accept all these Southern
hordes and remain unchanged. Still, a
cabby said as we left the Visitor's
Center, "I'll be happy when this is all
over, so we can get back to normal
business again."

I did some sightseeing myself,
exploring the rococo richness of the
Library of Congress. I closed my eyes
and imagined a camera, hung from
the roof, zooming in closer and closer
as I sat at one of those tables sorting
out little slips ... wow! This is where
they shot "All the President's Men."
"I am not a crook," "I do not
recollect," "Stonewall it" haunted the
place.

The Combined Armed Forces
manned every street corner in the
center of the city. They forced the
rebellious jumble of traffic into neat,
if sometimes angry, garrisons of
stalled cars and waiting pedestrians.
A Chilean general might have felt at
home amidst the machine gun-toting,
jeep-driving, walky talky-whispering
and saluting troops who were
positioned everywhere. Maybe the
Chiefs of Staff had forgotten that
Carter had claimed that the days of
the Imperial Presidency were over
and that the rebellious hippies who
had tried to spoil Nixon's inauguration had long since joined the
Green-and-White Brigade to the cry
of "Leaders for a change!"

All of this could not prevent a few
Yippies from holding a desperate
press conference proclaiming, once
again, that they were damned
disobedient. They handed out dope at
the Washington Monument: some of
it could be smelled near the latrines,
greeting the new era.

Everybody found something to do
in those few January days. The street
vendors, discarding their Bicentennial
plastics, loaded themselves and their
vehicles with green and white plastic
Carter buttons and peanuts. Grits and
Fritz peeked out from every corner of
their carts and boards. "Hi there, I'm
Jimmy Carter and I'm going to be
your next President." Buy me for a
quarter.
