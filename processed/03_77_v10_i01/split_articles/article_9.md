Parties: Double-Knits and Instamatics 
Washington was cold, but no one 
minded. On each street corner 
volunteers from the Maryland Bible 
Society handed me my very own 1977 
Inaugural Souvenir. "Jimmy Carter 
will stop adultery and fornication!" 
their pamphlet claimed. Loudspeakers 
everywhere blared the proceedings of 
the Inaugural while the crowds 
collected along Pennsylvania, three 
hours early for the parade. 

People wrapped in plaid stadium 
blankets sat in folding beach chairs 
behind police barricades. They waved 
tiny American flags, and green and 
white .. Jimmy" penants. Swaddled 
children sat placidly in strollers while 
their parents eased the cold with nips 
from steaming thermos bottles and 
discreet flasks. Vendors at every 
intersection hawked fluorescent green 
and fuchsia portraits of Carter and 
Mondale on buttons. Snack stands 
catered to the patient public; they 
offered Hari Krishna delicacies beside 
shiny tacos in saran wrap and 
"authentic" eggrolls. All I wanted was 
a hot dog and a coke. Finally, I 
settled for an orange crush, a vinyl 
cheeseburger, and positioned myself 
behind a family from New Jersey to 
watch the festivities. 

Shivering baton twirlers from 
Georgia high schools warmed them-
selves with their school flags as they 
waited for the grand march to begin. 
Secret Service sharpshooters lined the 
building tops, eagle-eyeing the 
oblivious crowds. During the 
inaugural address itself, store 
proprietors- including those from 
.. Live Peep Show" and .. Girls, Girls, 
Girls" - stepped out of their establish-
ments to hear the speech. 

At 8 p.m. the Inaugural Balls-or 
rather .. People's Parties"-
commenced. In my black chiffon 
evening gown, clogs, down jacket and 
ski mittens, I took the metro to the 
Pension Building where the second 
"add-on" ball was held. 

A female guard frisked me at the 
entrance. The assorted hardware 
around my wrist and my under-wire 
bra triggered a buzzer. Once again, 
sharpshooters nestled in balcony 
alcoves. Helicopters with search lights 
circled the building. There was a new 
crush of people, this time garbed not 
in the parkas and peacoats of the 
afternoon, but in floor-length, nylon 
party dresses and rented tuxedos. 

Hors d'oeuvres were plentiful: 
yellowed pretzels, pizza squares 
tasting of plaster-of-paris, anchovy 
paste, and enough peanuts to make 
me gag if I see one now. 
center flower arrangements rapidly 
disappeared as people plucked them 
as souvenirs. 

The news of the President's 
imminent arrival flashed across the 
room. Everyone pressed against the 
roped aisle toward the stage. I found 
myself feeling very squashed and 
short, sandwiched in between two tall 
couples. Louise's fur stole was made 
of ferrets whose penetrating glass eyes 
glared at me. Mabel stood behind me 
in a margarine-colored Caftan. Her 
husband Ernest had a glittering gold 
smile, and a laugh that made my head 
pound. 

Breathing down each other's 
necks-or up, in my case-, locked in 
place for 30 minutes as a cross 
between big band and muzak played, 
people made friends with each other. 
Swaying to the music, they exchanged 
state names, occupations, and 
invitation qualifications. Frank and 
Louise met two fellow Texans. Ernest 
discovered that the woman in front of 
him had the same brand of 
Instamatic. 

Then the Carters entered and the 
crowd became electric. Jumping up 
and down, one woman broke the heel 
of her shoe. Another fainted. On my 
tipmost toes I managed to catch a 
glimpse of a tuft of blow-dried hair, 
illuminated by spot lights. The band 
played soQiething that sounded like 
the "Queen for a Day" theme. Every 
Instamatic and Polaroid was poised 
with eager hopes of carrying home a 
snapshot souvenir. The taller people 
took photos for the shorter ones by 
raising the cameras at arms length, 
pointing them and clicking. 

The Carters left after I 0 minutes. 
The crush dissolved and someone 
announced the Fifth Dimension. In 
white jumpsuits and white smiles they 
rocketed onto the stage singing "Up, 
up and away ... " Many people had 
never heard of them; only three 
people danced. 

Listening to the 5 D's "Surrey Down" 
down," I became caught up. in the 
kitschiness of the scene. I watched 
people cluster around the ruined 
floral arrangements. Two women in 
identical, rhinestone-studded tube 
tops giggled over the coincidence of 
their appearance. 

I have to own up to a spasm of 
Americanism, though. I saved my 
ticket stub.
