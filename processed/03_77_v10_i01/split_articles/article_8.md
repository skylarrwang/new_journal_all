I r~turned to my resting place for 
the night to watch the Inaugural 
Gala. Jimmy looked happy. The 
Alvin Ailey Company got the crowd 
on their feet. Aretha Franklin made 
them cheer. Even Jimmy was moving 
his hands back and forth, in the 
manner of a Chinese statesman. 

Waking up on the cold dawn of 
January 20th, I drank a cup of coffee 
and rode the metro to the Senate 
Office Building. The morning passed 
in an endless, high-tension blur of 
motion. All Washington moved to the 
capitol in ever-contracting circles. 
The Russell Office Building seemed 
to be the heart of most of the action, 
a huge control-post of endless 
corridors. Throngs of people moved 
in and out of the suffocating offices. 
Plastic cups, holding hot chocolate, 
and plates of cake filled some offices. 
T.V.s blinked in others. Nobody had 
time to see anybody except the five 
million nobodys, those invited, united 
people of America who stared aÂ·t each 
other in the halls and offices. They 
were all waiting for a chance to see a 
somebody, to have something to talk 
about when they got back home. 
Finally at eleven o'clock we joined 
the huge crowd of people waiting at 
the narrow gates of the capitol 
grounds. We inched toward the two 
Marine guards taking tickets. Little 
did I know that reaching this gate 
was the first stage of a long odyssey 
to get closer to that great white chunk 
of card board with the presidential 
seal way up front. I prowled around 
the outskirts of the crowd, cased 
trees, avoided militia, and tried to 
push myself through the crowd with 
my WYBC pass. It was practically 
spat upon. 

Seeing a way out of this morass, I 
climbed over the string and boldly 
flashed my pass at a Marine. He 
flinched and retreated. Victory! I was 
now standing so close I could actually 
almost distinguish Jimmy's facial 
expression, cold and nervous. 

Then, he spoke. I leaned back on 
the crowd behind me and waited for 
the sweet Southern rhetoric to start 
flowing. But something was wrong. 
The words came haltingly; they were 
badly paced and cliched. 

The crowd loved it, though. They 
loved it even more when, after 
everyone had raced to find a place on 
the parade route, they discovered the 
first family strolling down the middle 
of the broad Washington Avenues. 
Harry Reasoner, seated in the back 
seat of a white Cadillac, commented 
on the whole affair. The D.C. police 
chief, the park chief, the cabinet 
officials, and even Fritz Mondale 
himself looked ridiculous in their fat 
cars as Carter walked easily past the 
cheers. 

The subsequent parade was all-
American. One float had the huge 
letters "USA" in reflecting metal, so 
that as the artist had intended, "the 
onlookers could see themselves in 
America." Floats of Arkansas 
products, Virgin Island girls, exhibits 
of the free press, and Massachusetts 
printing followed. Band after high 
school band passed by, each strutting 
to a different drummer. The Army, 
Navy, and other para-military groups 
marched in perfect unison; the 
cheerleaders from small Midwestern 
towns let their overweight legs dance 
to no apparent rhythm except the joy 
of being in the nation's capital. The 
parading horses left droppings all 
over the street; a band of cadets 
marched right throt.gh them. 

All of D.C. that night now centered 
around the eight Inaugural balls. I 
never got to the biggest and best of 
them- the Georgian party in the 
Armory, where all the big celebs 
watched Marshall Tucker belt out the 
Southern rock that had helped make 
Jimmy Carter great. I did squeeze 
myself into the Shoreham Hotel, 
where Minnesota hosted a mixed 
group of elegant Washington 
bureaucrats and businessmen, 
campaign workers and out-of-staters. 
The press room near the entrance was 
desolate. 

For the flfSt time, I saw adequate 
facilities for everyone, but everyone 
was too tired to use them. There was 
nothing left to say. Someone inter-
viewed Mondale's cousin from 
Norway. Everyone looked for Betty 
Friedan. The music in the two 
ballrooms, both decorated in sixties 
kitsch, was lousy, the drinks were 
expensive and for all of this people 
had paid $25. 

They were enjoying every moment 
of it. If the crowd wasn't boisterous. 
it was certainly giddy. "Hey, we 
won!" I heard a young kiJ wearing a 
Carter-Mondale button proclaim. 
"Oh, it's all so nice!" an elderly 
woman exclaimed. Even the couples 
not dancing or huddling in one of the 
little groups smiled at each other, the 
surroundings, a passerby. 

Then, suddenly, He was there. The 
crowd went wild, mobbed the small 
stage ... Are you having a good time?" 
Jimmy asked. 
"Yeah!" the crpwd roared back. 
"Has it been a great day? .. 
"Yeah!" 
"Do we live in a great country?!" 
"Are we going to make it even 
better in the next four years?" 
"Are you going to help me do it?" 
"Yeah!" I waited for: 
"And are we going to rock 'n roll 
tonight?" 
We spoke about what a great day it 
He spoke about what a great day it 
had been, how be hoped he would 
not betray our trust and how Rosalyn 
had worn the same dress at the last 
inaugural he had attended, his own as 
Governor of Georgia. "How many of 
you like Rosalyn's dress?" he asked 
and the crowd exploded again. They 
shouted and cried while he waved, 
until he finally gave in. He danced 
with his wife, cheek to cheek, arm in 
arm, smiling and kissing her. Where I 
was standing, to the side of the stage, 
I thought I saw Rosalyn drop a tear. 
Jody Powell looked at her,bewildered. 
Hey Jimmy, hey Rosalyn, you really 
are tender and loving? I clapped 
along with the crowd.
