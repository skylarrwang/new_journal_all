The observation unsettled her; apparently there were patterns people could not break. 
"I see this is one of yours," Mr. Geisler had said. He was thoughtfully eyeing a three-quarter-view portrait of an attractive, strong-shouldered woman with prominent cheek bones, full lips, a long, muscular neck, in a muted yellow shawl-collared dress or shirt. The painting had been executed on a rectangular wooden board and then brushed over with a sepia wash, so that it looked as if the wood had never been completely covered. "Not bad," he said, grinning expectantly at Cara, as if awaiting profuse thanks for a shining compliment. 
"You like it?" Cara said simply. 
"On the whole," her father mused, "it's not bad. The lips are too thick; the nose is good- very good." 
Suddenly he seemed suspicious. "You did that nose?" 
"Yes," Cara said, and that was the lie. The woman's nose- well-shaped, perfectly highlighted, with wide, winged nostrils- was the one part of this particular painting that Capraro had chosen to improve upon. He had done so thorough and impressive a job that Cara herself could not remember the original. Instead, she had, up until the second before she said "Yes," succeeded in more than half-convincing herself that it was her own work. 
But she had lied- she had always lied. Her parents were right: she would never learn. It was a pattern she could not break. 
Her father had returned now with the camera and a brown supermarket bag which he had given to Cara's youngest sister to hold. The little girl kept unrolling its top and peeking inside as if she thought its contents might have disappeared. Mr. Geisler took the camera out of its leather case and waved Cara to the spot- in front of the cabin steps- where he wanted her. She stood ready, hands on hips, smiling broadly for practice. Her lip still felt stiff; she was sure it was red and sore-looking. 
Just then, as Cara's luck would have it, Amy Ray walked up to the cabin. Amy Ray was one of Capraro's two favorites-the worst one. She was a lanky girl with stringy brown hair in pigtails, freckles, and a pink, inordinately fleshy nose. 
"Hi, Cara!" she said brightly. 
"Where have you been? I haven't seen you all day." She frowned, as if this fact had weighed heavily upon her mind for hours. Then she brightened again and waved cheerfully to Cara's parents. 
"Cara, why don't you ask your friend to be in the picture?" Mrs. Geisler said loudly. When Cara did not respond, she herself addressed Amy, gesticulating elaborately, so that even if the girl were deaf she would understand: "Come here, sweetie, come be in Mr. Geisler's picture!" 
The girl turned toward her and smiled with false, unbecoming shyness. 
"Are you sure?" Then to Cara: "Is it all right?" 
"But of course, Amy," Cara said coldly, with a French accent. 
Amy took her place next to Cara, imitating--consciously, Cara was convinced- her pose. Mr. Geisler said "Smile, girls!" and snapped their picture uneventfully. 
"That's all: no explosion, no fireworks," Cara said, mostly to herself. 
Her mother frowned deeply. Amy Ray punched her arm affectionately and said "See you tonight," before going inside. 
"Madeleine, it's time we got going," Mr. Geisler said, hanging the camera around his neck and motioning for his two younger daughters. 
"I'm ready," Mrs. Geisler said in an exhausted voice, as if she had just completed some grim and elaborate preparation for the trip home. Cara noticed with a jolt that her mother was scrutinizing her closely. 
"But first we have to give Cara her present." Mr. Geisler took the brown bag from the four-year-old, who hurried a last look inside before surrendering it reluctantly. "This is for you," Mr. Geisler said magnanimously, handing it to Cara. 
The bag contained a box of pretzels and a round cellophane package of dubious-looking candy- irridescent, pastel-colored sticks about the size and shape of small test tubes- which Cara knew at a glance she would hate. She had guessed when she first saw the bag that her parents had brought food-that was traditional- but she was disappointed. 
"Oh, great!" she said, keeping her voice miraculously free of irony. 
"Sustenance!" Inspiration seized her and she said to her mother: "You wouldn't believe how much I miss your cooking!" Now that her parents' departure was imminent, Cara felt, she could afford to be nice. Besides, it was true. 
Mrs. Geisler nodded, unaffected, still eyeing her daughter strangely. 
"They don't feed you here?" she said as if she really thought this might be true. 
"Oh, they feed us- it's what they feed us!" Cara tried to make her cheerful tones contagious. "You wouldn't believe what they have the nerve to call food." She grimaced humorously. 
"Yes, I would," her mother said ponderously. 
"Okay, kids, say good-bye to your sister," Mr. Geisler was saying. The two girls did so in unison. To Cara, depressed by her mother's sullen perversity, it sounded as if they had rehearsed. 
"Well, good-bye, Cara," Mr. Geisler said. "We'll see you in two weeks, I guess. Don't forget to write. Madeleine?" he urged, and started to walk with the two girls across the grounds to the parking lot. He and the little one, half-way there, turned once to wave and to summon Mrs. Geisler, whose lips, Cara saw from the corner of her eye as she waved back, had begun to tremble perceptibly. 
"That Amy seems like a nice girl," the woman said suddenly. 
"She's not," Cara insisted. It figured that the dreadful Amy Ray had something to do with her mother's agitation. 
"Well," the woman sighed, "I just thought-I just hoped-that maybe, finally, you were finding yourself a few friends-maybe you were finally learning to live with people. That's what I thought, that's what I hoped and prayed for." She shook her head. "But I see now I was wrong. I see now it was too much to expect from you." 
"I have a few friends. Amy Ray just isn't one of them." 
"Too much to expect. Too much to ask." The woman's head shook continuously now, as if with palsy. "Don't say good-bye to me. I know you don't want to." Her voice cracked. "I know it." 
Mrs. Geisler walked away swiftly, but her heavy legs, which Cara watched with terrible fascination, conveyed the impression that each step she took was weighted with a profound, maternal sorrow. 
Cara's cabin was the largest in the camp: two separate wings for campers and a smaller room between them for counselors. And it was considered the best, thanks to a built-in latrine. Cara was examining her face closely in the mirror above one of its three sinks. She pressed the skin above her lip tentatively. It felt unnaturally smooth, though in the mirror she could see enlarged pores which made it look uneven and cratered. It might have been red, too, but Cara couldn't tell: her whole face was red from crying. 
"Beautiful!" the girl said suddenly, the word condensing in a small circle of steam on the mirror. "Beautiful, beautiful. And I was ugly before-to think I was ugly before!" She laid the tips of four fingers gently on the sensitive skin. "Where would I be if my mother hadn't done this? Where would I be?" She pressed and took the hand away quickly, as if her fingers had been burned. Four small crescent-shaped indentations were strung above her lip. "I'd be ugly," she said in a high, strained voice. She replaced the fingers with great care, fitting each fingernail into its crescent. Then she scratched down hard over her lip. Scarlet threads appeared below two of the marks. "But now- now I'm absolutely gorgeous!" She started to laugh, but her mouth cracked into a grimace. "Oh, where would I be without my mother to do this for me?" she sobbed. "Where would I be without my mother?"
