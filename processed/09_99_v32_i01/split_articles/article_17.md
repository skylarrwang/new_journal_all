NEIGHBOR BACK HOME IN SEATrLE-pudgy and mid-
CUC:-at~~ed.·-JUSt sprang for a shiny new pair of MOMO 
.....,;~~ •• , ..... ,"' wheels for his otherwise run-of-the-mill Acura. 
I usually ignored customized cars, despite the countless times I'd 
watched some souped-up Honda or Mazda fly down Elm Street, 
determined to get through the Yale campus as fast as possible. Those 
cars, with their noisy mufflers and deeply tinted windows, were 
worlds apart from my neighbor, with his prim house and trimmed 
hedges. Customizing a car seems to take a considerable bit of inside 
knowledge. I can't just go down to Sears and pick up a couple of 
racing wheels while my tires are being rotated. So what's the appeal? 
Wheels are wheels, as distinctive from one another as pots in a 
kitchen: ·some are shinier than others. Customized cars seem tacky 
and self destructive; my high school classmates and I had watched 
in horror as a friend "raced out" his Honda Accord by lowering it, 
drilling holes in it, painting the whole thing silver and plastering it 
with decals. · 

Looking for an explanation, I found myself in a tiny tint shop 
at the corner of an empty lot in Hamden. It drew me in because it 
also advertised motor-sports, and I was hoping to find, afrer a little 
exploration, a performance Civic being tuned, or a giant gold-plat-
ed Cadillac having a new muffler installed. But it was a small place. 
A really small place. I stepped inside and found myself in the 
garage, where two men with spray bottles were installing tint on a 
two-door Dodge Neon. Though it was a garage, someone with 
domestic instincts had tried to create a waiting area, setting out two 
chairs and some magazines by the door. This small space was filled 
by two young girls, poured into striped tops and tight black pants. 
Apparently, the one clutching the huge set of keys with the glow-in-
the-dark key ring reading "sEXY" owned the Neon. 

I had a feeling that the tint shop was not the type of place I was 
looking for, although tint was a good start. The place sold alarms, 
10 I asked to have a look at some systems that could speak, think-
ing they would be a pretty good addition to a souped-up car. One 
of the installers, still holding a spray bottle, started to show me, but 
jUSt then, a man in an overcoat carrying an armload of stereo boxes 
stuck his head in the door, and asked if we could "use anything 
today." My guy with the spray bottle took a look at the man in the 
overcoat, looked at me, and then said back, "Sorry man, not today." 
rm back on the bus to Lanman-Wright before I realize why a stereo, 
alarm and tint store would not want the man's stereos.

lNCE THE BASS-PUMPING SPEAKERS of these cars can often be 
heard before the car is seen, I checked out a real stereo shop far-
rhcr up Dixwell, with a little more success. Sam, the owner of the 
shop, was an excitable guy who had been installing stereos for a 
lrhile, but was most proud of installing a bomb detecting system in 
a car years ago. 

I was a little disappointed that the only project in the shop's 
prage was a Dodge Caravan waiting for a radar detector. Still, he 
showed me pictUreS of cars he had worked on, some of which were 
downright impressive. He flaunted a photo of a Honda Prelude 
whose back seat had been replaced with speakers twice the size of 
Illy head. The trunk was filled with amplifiers and other stereo 
equipment, all mounted and displayed under plexiglass. The amps 
&ot so hot that they had to have their very own ventilation system. 
I found what I had come to see when I convinced Sam to take 
llle into the demo room where I could listen to some of those 
siant speakers. Sam preferred to play jazz, but at my 
~uest, we sampled a CD of his entitled "12. Bass Hits." 

That's how I learned that even a song called "The Bitch Role" (as in 
"everyone's gotta play the bitch role") could be beautiful if it could 
be played loud enough. The glass walls shook violently until Sam 
jumped to move a speaker. In sound competitions, he told me, peo-
ple have to hold the car windows in with towels to keep them from 
exploding from the pressure.

ETROIT HAS TO WORRY ABOUT HOW THEY SELL A CAR. but just 
about anything you do to your own car is completely legal," 
said an amateur racer who had come to eat at the restaurant where 
I parked cars. He was more into NASCAR-type competition, into 
horsepower, engine noise and size. He drove a Mustang that had 
apparently been souped-up quite a bit. I decided that it must have 
been in the early stages of enhancement since I had a hard time 
keeping it running while I parked it, so I don't know if I complete-
ly trust the advice he gave me. I was skeptical when he suggested I 
paint a scuffed bumper with a can of spray paint. I did, and 
although I followed his Miyagi-like instructions (sand, wash, sand, 
wash, ad. naus~am), I came out with a runny, bubbly mess that only 
vaguely resembled the shape and color of my bumper. I ended up 
having to get the whole thing repainted, which cost far more at that 
point than it would have had I taken the scuffed bumper to be 
fixed. So I cettainly didn't believe the racer when he said putting a 
tank of nitrous oxide in the trunk of a car not only makes the car 
go faster, but is also legal. 

Nitrous, which gets you high-
er than a kite at the dentist's 
office, did turn out to be 
legal. Still, it was 
hard to find car-
