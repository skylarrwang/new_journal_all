that they had been cut. Most showed up at the station to do their 
shows, only to find that they had been locked out of the station and 
that their access codes had been deactivated. Later, the Executive 
Board offered a select few an explanation for its actions. "They told 
us we were cut because we were unprofessional," says Rajeev 
Muttreja (SM 'oo), a former "Frequency" OJ and current OJ and 
Music Director of WYBvAM 1340. "They said that the product that 
was going out over the air wasn't ~lored to the YBC image and that 
no one was listening. We know people were listening." 

The Executive Board's heartless action, combined with exten-
sive coverage in the Yale Daily News and a sympathetic response 
&om the Yale College Council, prompted the DJs to act immedi-
ately. "A lot of students thought everything that happened to us 
was terrible," Muttreja says. "We sent out a petition for 3 days and 
got some 1.,000 signatures." Four months later, in April 1998, the 
DJS held an impeachment hearing for Abdelnaby, carrying the 
motion by an overwhelming 45-1. vote. However, by-laws stating 
that a certain percentage of the members had to be present barred 
his actual removal. 

In response to the student uproar, WYBC moved to buy a sec-
ond frequency dedicated to free-form expression. With the newly 
urban contemporary and hip-hop 94Â·3 JIM rargetting New Havens 
1 ~ously untapped black market and generating unprecedented 
. ~gs and revenue, the second station, AM 1340, could operate on 
rdacively low budget supported by the PM station, and thereby be 
from market restraints. 

Unfortunately for the tender relations between the students 
and the community members at the station, the AM 1340 frequency 
pursued by WYBC had previously belonged to WNHC, the only 
lllinority-owned and operated station in the city. According to 
Corwin, who was still managing WYBC during the AM 1340 take-
over, WNHC "wasn't serving the community that well. They had 
IOine syndicated home shopping nerwork, some urban program-
ming. which is usually not successful on an AM sration, and some 
talk shows that were biased and nor professionally done." When 
lrNHc declared bankruptcy in the spring of 1998, WYBC saw a solu-
tion to its problems and jumped at the chance to enter the bidding 
~. WYBC's main competition came from Bucldey Broadcasting. 
1tbich, Corwin says, made no commitment to broadcast local shows 
and which has "a history of trying to put on syndicated talk shows 
throughout the state, one of which is Bob Grant, who is known to 
S~ERIO,I999 
WYBC has many groups 
to please, but can all 
things be considered? 
be a racist." During negotiations, WYBC made clear at public meet-
ings that its aims for the AM station included not only expanding 
student programming. but also maintaining some talk shows and 
religious programs previously aired on WNHC. The station has since 
kept its promise and now airs shows such as "Teen Talk," "Youth 
Action Christian Communication" and a five-hour gospel broadcast 
on Sunday afrernoons to complement the PM station's 1. AM to 11. PM 
gospel show. In addition, the PM station donates, as it did then, 25 
percent or S250,ooo worth of commercial time to local, non-profit 
and community service organizations. That averages to about 12. 
minutes of donated space per commercial block (WPLR's main com-
petitor, 101.3 WKCI, donates 10 minutes a day), making WYBC the 
station most dedicated to public service not just in New Haven, but 
in the e11tire state. 

Despite such demonstrations of the station's commitment to 
WNH:C programming and to community affairs, and despite the 
undesirability of the alternative, WYBc's purchase of AM 1340 in June 
1998 met with stark opposition. Community members seemed 
unable to sepuate their negative image of Yale from their image of 
the sration only loosely associated widl it, and many joined a hell-
bent, but wildly misinform~ Reverand A1 Sharpton to protest 
Yale's theft of the community voice.

nity voice can be found ~arly in the WYBC office. 
Doc Percival, or Doc P. as he's known in the disc jockey 
world, has been coming to work at the FM sration nearly every day 
for the past three years. Doc is only one of many New Haven res-
idents who, either following their dreams- to become professional 
disc jockeys or simply wanting to express th~ir views, make their 
way to WYBC for training and ajr time: Wofking towards its goal of 
"bringing students and New Haven residents -together for the bet-
terment of both," the station opens its doo~to all and provides the 
kind of professional training that othe.nwise would cost its members 
thousands of dollars ar the Conneticut School of Broadcasting. 

Joining Doc at WYBC F.M are prominent public figures, ambitious 
Yale OJS, and a mix of black and white youth. Doc's dedication, 
though, sets him apart from them all. On weekdays, Doc actives 3 
or 4 hours early to work as the paid, part-time Music Director. He's 
on the air every weekday from 5 to 7 PM during commuter "drive-
time" and every Friday with his best friend, Stevie D., on their show 
"Friday Night Dance Party," which is the most popular show in the 
city from 9 PM to 2. AM. 

Doc and Stevie use their air time to promote the SM Crew, or 
Sound Masters, an organization of "socially-minded disc jockeys" 
that Doc founded 2.0 years ago. The group, which releases p6si-
tivdy-charged mix tapes and singles for underground distribution, 
includes Stevie, who also works as Community Representative to 
the WYBC Executive Board, and Castillo, who struggled through his 
own involvement in drugs and gangs. This spring they released a
