ALL ME BACK. Some days ago—
never mind how many precisely—
having a little money in 
my pocket, and a little time on my hands, 
I thought I would go purchase a coffee. It is 
a way I have of driving off the spleen, and 
~ating the circulation. Whenever I find 
myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever
it is a damp, drizzly September in my soul; when
I find myself involuntarily falling asleep while the sun 1;:.s ....... 
DOt far past its noon pinnacle in the sky, and especially when the 
weight of my responsibilities becomes so great a load that I feel even 
the shoulders of Atlas himself might buckle under such a pressure, 
then, I account it high time to get a coffee. With a philosophical 
ftourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly imbibe a cup 
of java. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, 
almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very 
nearly the same feeling toward that magical bean with me. 


Circumambulate the city of New Haven of a rainy Tuesday 
afternoon. Go from the comer of Elm Street and York and from 
there southward, to another corner, that where College and Chapel 
Stteets converge. Go eastward to Whitney Avenue and, a step or 
two to the south again, to Audubon Street. What do you see?—
hundreds upon hundreds of men filling the sundry coffee purvey-
ors in the city, indulging in caffeinated reveries. Some holed up in 
dark corners sipping still darker brew, some, beturtlenecked, sitting 
with mannequin stillness in a street side window, some reclining 
like Romans on deep sofas, some walking and quaffing simultaneously, 
risking a stain and a sting if a wave of that scalding beverage 
breaks like a swell over the side of dueling cardboard cups. 


It was in an effort to emulate these masses that I encountered 
that most impudent and curt retort with which I began, and now I 
find myself quite unable to shake its din from my ears when thinking
on coffee matters: Call me back. Yes, these were the words, 
uttered in a most frustrated tone, by one I had heretofore esteemed 
quite highly. It happened thusly: I had been endeavoring to begin 
this, my latest coffee consumption, making my way to a renowned 
Idler of the bean, a seller by the name of Atticus. Named for the 
Greek orator, in our century this man provided poets and the students of poetry with 
coffee. Approaching this familiar locale, 
however, my eyes met with quite a sur-
prise indeed. I knew the familiar sellers 
of coffee in New Haven: the aforemen-
tioned Atticus; Duncan Donut, merchant 
of a simple but tasty beverage and inventor of a 
piece of fried dough, circular, with a hole in the middle and a handle for dipping; and Willoughby, a 
Connecticut Yankee with a blend as strong and bold as his business 
sense. But I cannot well describe my surprise when off the starboard 
side of Atticus' walls I spied a name I knew well: Starbuck. 


I was familiar with the exploits of this Starbuck from a fascinating
account of his actions as first mate aboard a ship, named the 
Pequod, by one Herman Melville. Truly a fascinating document. 
Why, then, stood I so transfixed by the name I saw there in a green 
contrasting Atticus' vermilion? Well, Mr. Melville has the good 
Starbuck drowning with the rest of the Pequod's crew at the end of 
his vast and exhaustive account, the victim of Moby Dick and the 
Captain who hunted that huge white whale. 


I resolved to research this Starbuck and his biographer Melville. 
It seems that the man I took to be so meticulous a chronicler in fact 
made many grave and outrageous errors in his account. 


Through the perusal of several pertinent documents—documents
perfectly available to Mr. Melville, documents left untouched 
by him either out of incompetence or indolence—I discovered, 
astonishingly, that the albino whale chronicled by Melville haunted 
not the Atlantic, but rather breached and spyhopped off the coast 
of Chile. So remiss is Melville that he even mismonikers his whale: 
the whale's name was not Moby Dick. No, for when first that white 
fluke saluted a pair of human eyes—surely sending the owner of 
those eyes nearly over the side of his crow's nest in stupefaction—it 
was off the coast of the Mocha Islands. The crew of that ship had 
the honor of naming the white whale Mocha Dick. This mistake 
appears all the more egregious when one considers that Melville visited
Chile before writing what I had taken for an accurate account, 
but which was in fact so rife with incongruities that it could be


Herman Melville had his eye on Starbuck's exploits long before we did. 


Entering Starbuck's new digs, I mused 
that perhaps the switch was not so strange 
at all; coffee is an exotic libation, growing 
most prosperously and deliciously in the 
climes a veteran salt knows well. Knowing 
Mr. Starbuck to be saltier than 
Lot's wife, I was not awed by 
the fact that his nautical 
life seemed to be 
stamped upon his 
new one: even the 
emblem of his coffee-
house features a 
ship's masthead. 
The selections of 
coffee, their names 
spelled out above 
the store's counter, 
read like a whaler's 
passpon (had whalers carried 
such documents): 
"Columbia Narino Supremo," 
"Arabian Mocha Java," "Sumatra," and 
even one named after that bane of the 
ancient mariner, "Siren's Note Blend." By 
far the most prevalent word to be seen on 
the menu, however, was "mocha." 


Starbuck, though now safe on land, clearly 
was still haunted by that fateful attack by 
Mocha Dick. I pitied the man. 


At that moment I was jarred from my 
ruminations by the green-aproned young 
man behind the counter, whose name tag 
showed that he, like the coffee, had foreign 
origins, though Pierre's were presumably 
more European. "Can I help you with anything?" 
Pierre asked. I asked him if it might 
be possible to speak with the proprietor of 
the store. "Why, is there something wrong, 
sir?" the young man responded, apparently 
troubled by my request. I assured Pierre 
that I merely wanted to meet the man. 


Somewhat reluctantly he informed me that 
the store's owner was most easily reached 
via telephone, and that he was usually not 
in the store proper. He gave me the number
and a quizzical look that I resented. 


Convinced of Melville's incompetence, I was thus
assured that New Haven's newest coffee trader was indeed the former
first mate of said P~quod as I had suspected, though I was unable to
turn up any documents which confirmed that he had escaped watery
peril, either via rescue by the Rach~/ or otherwise. To learn of his
escape and investigate his strange switch from harpooning to
percolating, I resolved to visit Mr. Starbuck. 


To learn of his escape and investigate his strange switch 
from harpooning to percolating, I resolved 
to visit Mr. Starbuck. 


Made all the more curious by my visit 
to his shop, I telephoned Starbuck forthwith. A harried voice, sounding a bit 
younger than I had expected, answered the 
phone: "Starbucks New Haven." 


"Good day, Mr. Starbuck," I cheerily 
began, "I do not mean to take up too much 
of your valuable time, but I am what you 
might call a f.ut of yours. I wondered if you 
could recount for me how it was you 
escaped the sinking of the P~quod. That 
Melville character sure has the 
story wrong. And I am fascinated by what has 
brought you 
to become 
a seller 
of ... " 


"What?" 


"I have read 
of your exploits, 
Mr. Starbuck, in 
Herman Melville's 
rather shoddy ... " 


"My name is 
Billy Hawthorne, I am 
the owner/operator of 
Starbucks New Haven. If 
you are interested in finding ... " 


"I can understand your desire to use a 
pseudonym, to put your past behind you, 
Mr. Starbuck, but ... " 


"My name is Bill, bud, not Starbuck." 


"You are not Starbuck, former first 
mate of the P~quod?" 


"Listen, I am a very busy man. I would 
be happy to talk to you about our new 
Starbucks location in New Haven, but 
you're going to have to call me back, I am 
late to a meeting." 


"New location?" 


"You're going to have to call me back. • 


"But you are not ... " 


"Call me back." 


And with that he hung up the phone. 


Call me back! Why, Hagar's son would 
have felt more welcome in the tent of 
Sarah! My astonishment as a result of his 
impudence, his absolute disregard for my 
inquiries, was only outdone by my shock at 
the fact that this man was not Starbuck at 
all, but just some money grubber looking 


to double his ducats using the good name 
of that honest sailor. The imposter! The 
charlatan! The confidence man! 


For quite a while I was rendered 
immobile by my discoveries, but soon my 
ire spurred me into action. I had to know 
more about this Starbuck's operation. New 
location? Are there others? Why had no 
one discovered this fraud? 


What I discovered knocked me to the 
deck. There are nearly 2,000 Starbucks in 
the United States alone. The corporation is 
larger than Mocha Dick himself and is 
stalking complete control over the coffee 
trade as obsessively as Ahab himself pursued
that whale. And just as a humpback 
whale, utilizing that mysterious wall, the 
baleen, devours millions of krill in one fell 
swallow, so has Starbucks consumed its 
competition. The irony! to use the first 
mate's name to conceal the captain's heart! 
It is a subterfuge both sickening and dark. 


We must not let them succeed. Some 
cities have resisted: Nantucket and New 
Bedford have not succumbed. Let us once 
again follow the lead of those bustling port
cities! Muster up a militia Willoughby! 
Form a phalanx, followers of Atticus! 
Koffee? turn your interrogative into an 
exclamation! 


I have done my part. In the darkest 
hour of the night—Jonah! it was darker 
than the innards of the Leviathan—I 
stole to Starbucks' storefront and nailed 
a sky-hawk to that false masthead. May 
Starbucks' share of the coffee trade sink like 
the ill-fated Pequod/ and may Starbucks 
meet poor Starbuck's fate.
