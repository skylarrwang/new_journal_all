AMELA THOMAS-GRAHAM employs an 
intellectual setting to lend gravitas to 
a thin plot, in her book Blue Blood: An Ivy 
League Mystey. She exploits popular atti-
tudes about the Ivy League: a mixture of 
envy and admiration. But Yale students 
looking for a trashy, escapist read will find 
that Blue Blood won't take them very far. 


Harvard BA, MBA and JD Pamela 
Thomas-Graham demonstrates limited 
knowledge of both Yale and mystery writ-
ing in her caper. This book is only the sec-
ond of what she plans as a series of who-
dunits, each set at a different Ivy League 
school. 


Our victim, conservative Yale Law 
School professor Amanda Fox, young, 
blond and gorgeous, like so many of our 
faculty, is found stabbed ro death in a poor 
black neighborhood. One of her black stu-
dents is immediately thrown in jail. Our 
heroine, Nikki Chase, a Harvard econom-
ics professor who like so many of her col-
leagues is young. black and beautiful, rush-
es to comfort the victim's husband, her old 
friend Gary Fox, dean of Branford College. 


Chase hasn't been cured of her habit of 
interfering in official police investigations 
after successfully resolving a case at 
Harvard only months before. Here in 
gloomy New Haven, she quickly finds ... 
things are not as they seem. 


Agatha Christie it isn't. Not even Sue 
Grafton. The novel's victim, Amanda Fox, 
owes her fame to being "a beautiful, smart, 
truly conserva-
tive 
woman 
being as rare 
as a canine 
who can speak." 


The same could be said of the 
author's own success. As the jacket photo 
and bio attest, Thomas-Graham is an 
attractive, young African-American woman 
who holds multiple Harvard degrees and is 
the first black woman to be named parmer 
at McKinsey and Company, the world's 
largest management consulting firm. Her 
accomplishments are so impressive that 
evaluating the book on its own merits 
seems mean-spirited. 


Nevertheless, it must be observed that 
as a writer of prose or architect of plots, 
Thomas-Graham makes a damned fine 
management consultant. Her penchant for 
cliche dictates her choice of diction, char-
acter, situation and setting. The plot points 
of the mystery can be summed up in a few 
well-worn phrases which all appear in the 
text. The murder investigation quickly 
becomes a "racial powder keg" ignited by a 
charismatic local minister, "a masterful imi-
tation of Al Sharpton." Was Amanda Fox a 
victim of a "random street crime"? Or was 
it a "coldly calculating strategy session" by 
the "Barbie .. .lacrosse-titute" who was 
sleeping with her husband? Was it the 
"twisted revenge" of a spurned lover? Or 
perhaps she was a "pawn" in the "power 
game" played by the eccentric "low-class 
hillbilly millionaire broth-
ers on the Yale Board of 
Trustees to cause her hus-
band to commit "career sui-
cide." T he possibilities are lim-
ited. 


"For a Harvard professor, 
you've been incredibly stupid," the murder-
er tells Nikki in the final confrontation, 
and the reader has to agree. Her method of 
crime-solving involves going places alone 
with suspected murderers and annoying 
them by talking about the crime until they 
hand her clues on silver platters. She then 
repeats these pieces of information to 
everyone she runs into, as though they were 
revelatory. For example, we get to hear four 
or five times that a typed suicide note is 
probably forged, and that a white man 
wearing makeup could appear to be black. 
Who knew? 


The police, meanwhile, ignore these 
obvious pieces of evidence because they 
have a black man in jail, apparendy with no 
lawyer. A common story of race and justice 
in America. To her credit, Thomas-Graham 
aims higher than the gut in this novel, rais-
ing questions of prejudice and social divi-
sion. The Yale-New Haven setting provides 
pertinent examples of the uneasy relations 
between the overprivileged and the under-
privileged. The author plays up the ironies 
Yale students encounter every day as we 
hurry past two or three homeless people on 
our way to Sterling. 


THE New jouRNAL


The book's social message, however, is 
gloued over by the general shallowness of 
the writing. Despite an overheated riot 
ICale on Cross Campus (broken up by tear 
ps!), very little seems to be at stake. There 
ia nothing in the novel to chaUenge those 
who 
consider themselves 
reasonably 
enlightened on the subject of race or class. 


Thomas-Graham misses the opportu-
aity to throw w off the trail of the mystery 
by violating our liberal assumptions about 
who is innocent and who is guilty. We 
bow the cute young football star will wind 
ap cleared of his professor's murder, and 
dae zealous minister, though fiercely pro-
lleetive of his parishioners, is ultimately on 
the side of justice. All the good guys have 
CIDrrect racial attitudes, and all the bad guys 
â€¢ 
theN-word to telegraph their malice. 


l;anhermore, Nikki's race never hampers 
~ investigation; in fact, she is able.to use 
it as a kind of backstage pass to get the 
truth out of both wary New Havcnites and 
University liberals. 


The author's reliance on easy, positive 
l'lcial stereotypes as substitutes for charac-
terization is grating at times. Nikki receives 
Yital assistance in her investiption from 
Pearl and Marva at the beauty parlor; 
l.taggie, her chicken-frying landlady; and 
lay, the wise West Indian cop. The entire 
'West Indian dialect used by the author 
CIDftlists of a single syllable: "Mon." 


Nevertheless, the most offensive 
lllaeotyping the reader will encounter in 
this mystery is of Yale and New Haven 
lbemselves. In the book's acknowlcdg-
llents, Thomas-Graham thanks seventeen 
people by name who helped her create an 
llltbentic picture of Yale. In an interview 
IIOicM on the Barnes and Noble website, 
llae states that she spent an entire semester 
~ng down to New Haven and "poking 
-.nd." This extensive research yields 
-.ny correct references, from Atticus to 
'tVoH baked ziti. There is also a hilarious 
llaJ confrontation with the murderer set at 
ie top of Harkness Tower.

But like the Cantab she is, Thomas-
Graham can't resist the opportunity for an 
unAattcring comparison or disparaging 
remark: "At its heart, Harvard's campus 
exuded an all-American simplicity, func-
tionality and optimism, whereas this place, 
in its soul, seemed quintessentially 
European: sophisticated, ornate and world-
weary." It is hard not to take umbrage at 
backhanded comments about the "oppres-
sive grayness and squalor of New Haven," 
with its "constant rain," "rows of boarded-
up buildings" and "deserted streets." These 
arc the kinds of characterizations that 
determine the university's public percep-
tion. Parts of the book, in fact, seem to be 
taken dirccdy from news coverage of the 
murder of Suzanne Jovin. There is the same 
shock, anxiety and feeling of invasion 
expressed by Yalies, the same deluge of 
accusations and speculation by the local 
press, the same unwillingness by the Yale 
administration to comment on anything 
related to the murder. 


The existence of our own real-life 
murder mystery has no doubt been a boon 
to sales of this book. In an online interview 
given in June, Thomas-Graham works this 
connection to the fullest. She cites the 1991 
murder of Christian Prince as one of her 
"inspirations," rubbing it in with the 
remark, "unfortunately, they [Yale] have 
had several episodes of students being 
crime victims." She brought up the Jovin 
case as well, mentioning "some incredible 
parallels with my book, even though my 
book was written before it occurred." In 
fact, the parallels, other than timing and 
setting, arc hard to see. For those of us who 
experienced the Yale community's grief last 
spring over the loss of one of our own, 
mentioning the case seems offensive and 
exploitative. Linking Blu~ Blood with any 
real tragedy, despite making a good angle 
for book publicity, lends the book more 
substance than it deserves.
