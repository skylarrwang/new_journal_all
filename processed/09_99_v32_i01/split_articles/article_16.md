Controversy. An office manager In Hamden has 
called and asked for thr .. workers to come and 
move furniture. A mlnu1e later, he calls back, and 
his mind has changed: unhappy with the Labor 
Reedy workers he employed the previous week, 
he only wants two now. S..n and another man 
stand up and pick up their belongings, eager to 
begin work, only to IMrn that Chris has chosen 
two men who came In later. Donning their extra-
large blue Labor Ready t-shlrts, the two lucky 
ones walk hastily out of the room. Frustrated and 
tired, -
all sit back down, not quite surprised. 
Chris has been known to choose his own per-
sonal favorites over those with, say, bad breath 
or hostile attitudes. 
On Llvef wfth Regia and Kathie Lee, Miss 
T"n USA, a recent high school graduate from 
Del-are, announces to the world that she 
strives to combat teenage drug use and, eventu-
ally, help bring about world peace. She plans to 
study economics next year. 


12:01 PM 
Besides me, two other people are left. AI, a pre-
maturely graying man In his early forties with 
whom I've been taking smoke breaks outside, 
says he's had it. "Fuckln' A, man. Same shit 
everyday. I've had It, you know what I'm saying? 
These people rob you, you know what I'm say-
Ing? I've had it. I'm going to Hamden, get me a 
real job." I nod my assent, end try to forget that 
this Ia the same speech, nearly verbatim, that AI 
gave me yesterday. 
We walk back Inside, and AI goes to the 
rear to retrieve his bike, which he says Chris only 
reluctantly allows his to leava In the office. Only 
one parson, Sean, still remains, nodding oft every 
so often and then shaking awake wilh a violent 
jerk. I take one final look around the office, hold-
Ing the door open for AI, surveying the colored 
signs lining the otherwise plain office: "Are you a 
Premium Worker?" one asks. Most alarming Is a 
sign adjacent to the fingerprint-smudged six foot 
mirror, from which I can see a blurry reflection of 
myself: "Would you hire this parson?"

under it. We're concerned about our workers. We give away free cof-
fee and provide an open, airy space." Still, the walls of the open, 
airy, bulletproof glass-free space are covered in signs with respeccful 
words of encouragement like "You are terminated if you tell me 
how to do my job." I understood why this might be such a com-
mon problem only when I saw the manager assign work seemingly 
at random, completely disregarding the order in which people 
showed up and signed in. Another demeaning sign rests above the 
coffee maker: "If you cannot clean-up after yourself then you will 
not be able to consume food or beverages here in the building. 
labor Ready provides coffee for you the workers, it is a privilege 
that can be taken away if you can not [sic] clean up after yourself 
[aic]. There will be no excuses, if you have any questions please ask 
a member of the Labor Ready staff." Despite the errors, the work-
en pour their coffee with paranoid care, their backs to the manag-
er, never knowing whether he's watching or not. It is interesting that 
a company which demands that its workers show up every morning 
at six makes such a big deal out of its generosity in bestowing cof-
fee and non-dairy creamer. Other signs are merely short, emphatic 
Statements, such as "INJURED WORKERS WILL BE TESTED FOR DRUGS 
AND ALCOHoL!" If Labor Ready were as concerned about its work-
ers as it claims it would test them before sending them out-and 
not make the safety quiz open-book. 
SltPTEMBER 10, 1999 
Despite its meteoric rise, Labor Ready remains out of sight and 
therefore out of mind to all but the poorest and wealrhiesr among 
us. While its Chapel Street storefront is only half a block from the 
Yale campus, it is well-known to the homeless bur rarely noticed by 
students. Hedge fund managers, though, have taken an interest in 
Labor Ready, known as "LRw" on the New York Stock Exchange. Of 
late, Labor Ready, Inc. has become the darling of rhe business press. 
A glowing article appeared in Forb~s last year declaring "Labor 
Ready finds work for felons, drunks and homeless people. No,' it's 
not a charity. It is a real business." Businesswuk likewise hailed the 
company-though in a more restrained manner-with the paren-
thetical praise that it was "(nonunion, needless ro say)." And just 
last month, Fortune named Labor Ready the seventh fa.nest-

growing company in America. Peterson too 
seemed aware of his company's corporate 
prowess. "This company reminds me a lot 
of McDonalds," he said with pride. Indeed, 
the xo-year-old Tacoma-based company 
employs over half a million people each 
year, easily making it one of the largest pri-
vate employers in the country. By contrast, 
its better known Seattle-Tacoma area 
neighbor (and fellow Chapel Street resi-
dent) Starbucks employs only 26,ooo. 
Labor Ready, which anticipates revenues in 
excess of $1 billion next year recently 
jumped from the NASDAQ to the NYSE, 
where it has been a favorite ofWall Street. 
It was recently picked by Kiplingn-'s as a 
"Smart Move for 1999" because, as a stock 
analyst told the publication, "the trend 
toward outsourcing continues to be very 
powerful." The quotation echoed a Labor 
Ready manager I talked to who bragged 
that "we're growing and everyone else is 
downsizing. And if you get downsized, 
where else can you go?" 
What is so cunningly twisted about 
Labor Ready is that it both feeds off this 
trend and contributes to it. A firin that 
finds its worlters in homeless shelters 
depends on a lack of decent jobs for 
unskilled people, and yet, simply by exist-
ing it helps eliminate any remaining decent 
jobs for the unskilled. In fact, Labor 
Ready's corporate literature all but tells 
companies to downsize their least-skilled 
employees. "We pay all taxes and insur-
ance," a Labor Ready brochure crows. "You 
are no longer obligated for: Health Care 
Premiums, Life Insurance Payments, 
Pension Plan Deposits [or] Paid Tune-
Off." The brochure does not say "you will 
not be obligated for," but rather you will 
"no longer [be] obligated for," assuming 
that until Labor Ready is called in these 
workers have health coverage, pensions and 
the like. Needless to say, Labor Ready will 
not provide these benefits for the employ-
ees. No one will, and therein lies the 
savings. 
As more and more people are down-
sized and replaced with Labor Ready 
temps, the ranks of homeless and impover-
ished-the very people Labor Ready places 
in day jobs--grow. The only way homeless 
people or battered women will escape their 
situation is through decent jobs which give 
them the financial independence to better 
their situation. Labor Ready both makes 
sure such jobs become fewer and fewer and

uses the desperate populations the destruc-
tion of such jobs creates. 
This cycle is unstoppable, as Peterson 
explained: "Say the government starts 
requiring employers of more than ten peo-
ple to provide health care." This proposal is 
not so hypothetical: a similar one was part 
of the 1992 Clinton healthcart plan. 
Presumably this policy would be enacted to 
counter the corporate war on worker 
benefits which Labor Ready is at the fore-
front of fighting. By passing such a law, the 
government would provide health care for 
millions of uninsured workers at large com-
panies. At least it would on paper. "How 
do you get around it?" Peterson continued. 
•catl up Labor Ready," he says-and 
replace your full-time staff with temps. 
It was easy to see how this theory was 
put into practice when I spoke with James, 
another young black man at Labor Ready. 
James had first come to Labor Ready six 
months ago. The company placed him in a 
temp job with a company that liked his 
work and decided to hire him. Only six 
months later he had been downsized and 
was back where he started, at Labor Ready, 
working one day at a time for low pay and 
no benefits. With a service like Labor 
Ready around, many companies have no 
reason to give out steady jobs. Still, those 
companies deserve our deepest sympathies, 
according to Peterson. "It's hard for com-
panies to make money. It really is," he told 
me as he looked out over a room of people 
who had been waiting for three hours to 
find a day's work. 
But Labor Ready is not one of those 
companies in dire straits. Its unique ability 
both to contribute to and benefit from the 
economic and social degradation of 
America's cities has kept its profits growing 
and its stock price rising. Senator Phil 
Gramm once observed that "if America is 
to be saved, it will be saved at a profit." 
That may or may not be true. What Labor 
Ready makes certain, however, is the 
reverse: if America is to be ruined, it will be 
ruined at a profit.
