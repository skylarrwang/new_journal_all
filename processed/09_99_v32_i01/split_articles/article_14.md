S 
T. BRENDANS CONVENT IS A SMALL BRICK BUILDING ON A HILL, sheltered from the daily 
noise and activity ofWhalley Avenue. It is home to six women, formally called the Sisters 
of Our Lady of the Garden. They came from Argentina, Paraguay, Italy and India. They 
devote their lives to one mission: "to work courageously, energetically, and perseveringly, 
bringing Christ's love and spirit to those to whom they are sent." They are proud of the work 
they do, and of the lives they touch. They walk the halls of St. Brendan's Convent, pointing 
with pride to delicate portraits of their founder, St. Anthony Maria Gianelli, and of their 
namesake, Our Lady of the Garden. They generously open the doors to their chapel and to 
the elementary school they have been running in New Haven since 197 4Â· 

These women are not foreign to the curiosity with which most people see them. One sis-
ter laughs as she describes children too young to be polite, who gasp when they see that Sister 
Natalfn lives in a house and sleeps in a bed just as anyone else does. Just like anyone else, these 
sisters go grocery shopping. They watch television. They even take care of a dog named Toby. , 

Sister Natalin is eager to guide the camera to the most "normal" aspects of her life. Again, she 
says with a laugh, "I take all kinds of these pictures with my students." 

The Sisters of Our Lady of the Garden put their energy into teaching their young students, 
and travelling the world in order to recruit women to join them in their mission. They do not 
concern themselves with the reasons why their lifestyle or their mission may seem puzzling to 
outsiders. Instead, they welcome these outsiders without a second thought. As one sister says, 
"What we do here is nothing strange. It is simply a matter of faith.,,
