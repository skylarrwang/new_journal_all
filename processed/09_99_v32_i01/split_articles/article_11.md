**Title:  WYBC: A Station Fighting for Survival**

EPHRAM LUSTGARTEN (PC 'oo), the General Manager of the Yale 
Broadcasting Company (WYBc), swears by his company manual. Within its pages, he has found solid ideals on which to 
base his vision of the radio station. "I would quote the mission," he 
urges me. "It's very important." 

More important than I might have thought. The future of 
Yale's radio station may hinge on how closely it adheres to its official mission in the next few years. The company gospel lists three 
basic purposes for the station's existence: to serve the interests of the 
student body, to train its members in the field of radio and to bring 
students and the community together for the betterment of both. 

Juan Castillo, the tall, 48-year-old black-Hispanic man who serves 
as WYBC's Director of Community Affairs, has witnessed the station's near-collapse in its attempts to adhere to all three statements. 
These days, he believes in a slightly different goal: "Our mission," 
he says, "is to stay alive." 

For most of its existence WYBC has struggled just to remain in 
operation. While most non-profit and college stations hold telethon 
fundraisers and receive grants from their parent institutions, WYBC, 
as one of only three commercial, non-profit radio stations in the 
country, must rely solely on advertisements to generate revenue. At 
the same time, WYBC's status as an undergraduate organization prevents it from hiring an advertising director, so the station must rely 
on the efforts of student volunteers already busy with classes. 

Yale University, WYBC's parent institution, has proven less than 
sympathetic to the station's financial troubles. While the stations at 
Quinnipiac College and the University of New Haven receive generous grants from the schools' undergraduate organizations' funds 
and communications departments, Yale lacks both a communications department and the desire to support a vocational endeavor. 
"Yale breeds doctors, lawyers, and investment bankers," says Kathy 
Choi (BK 'oo), current Program Director for WYBC. "They're not 
interested in creating a breeding ground for broadcast entertainers." 

The university does offer WYBC rent-free use of its current space 
in Hendrie Hall, but the station itself incurs the rest of the significantly larger operating expenses. 

Yale Broadcasting saves some 
money through its governance by the all-student Executive Board, 
but still has to provide salaries for the full-time Director of 
Operations and part-time Music Director and Director of 
Community Affairs who oversee the operation of the station during 
the day while students go to class. In addition, the station has to 
pay for utilities and for the maintenance of its transmitter and studio equipment. The Executive Board carefully budgets the advertising revenue, but any mismanagement can throw the entire station into debt. According to Castillo, in 1988, perhaps the station's 
worst fiscal year, "They told us in a month we were closing. We 
were only making $20-25,000 a year and our expenses were $50-
60,000." Out of desperation, the station borrowed $56,000 from 
the university, a debt which it has yet to pay off in full. 

In 1994, to ease its financial worries, the Station signed a joint 
sales agreement with General Broadcasting of Connecticut, Inc. 
(also known as 99.1 WPLR.) in which WPLR agreed to sell advertising 
time and collect advertising revenue for WYBC. In return it allocated WYBC enough money from that revenue to continue operations. 
The agreement has lightened the WYBC management's workload, 
but the terms of the arrangement hardly seem fair. According to 
Jason Knight (ES '00), head of WYBC's Gospel department, selling 
advertisements for WYBC costs WPLR virtually nothing. WYBC provides the announcers and the studio, while WPLR simply instructs its 
sales representatives to offer advertising time on 94.3 WYBC, currently the number one urban station in New Haven, while selling 
ads for WPLR. From this joint sales agreement, WPLR makes $1.5 to 
$2 million a year-nearly all profit-$300,000 of which goes to 
WYBC. Knight contends that $300,000, even budgeted well, barely 
covers basic operations, let alone one-time events or equipment 
purchases. This month, Knight says, "the Gospel department sponsored the largest concert in all of New Haven and I was hard pressed 
to find the $850 we needed to print up 250 free T-shirts to give away 
at the event." When WPLR refused to support the project, WYBC was 
forced to rethink its budget. "It's a shame that we had to take away 
money from other parts of our budget to do that," Knight says. 
"We had to sacrifice other goals." 

The joint sales agreement has also forced WYBC to sacrifice 
some of its programming decisions and its dedication to innovative 
programming. Six years ago, WYBC boasted 13 distinct formats, 
from indie rock to Italian folk. After the signing of the agreement 
in 1994, that number had dropped to around three besides the 
urban contemporary, hip-hop and R&B which catered to a largely 
community-based listenership. A college rock program called 
"Frequency" enjoyed a prime time slot from 9 PM to 2 AM, Monday 
through Friday, but its positioning directly after the highly rated, 
hip-hop-centric "Spectrum" alienated urban listeners, and ratings 
consistently dropped at nine. Problems came to a head in the 
spring of 1998 in a highly publicized campus controversy. WYBC's 
General Board had recently elected Emad Abdelnaby (OC '99) as its 
Program Director. Abdelnaby, an ambitious student straight off an 
internship at a large-market station in New York, responded positively to WPLR's requests that the station abandon the eclectic programming typical of college radio nationwide and adopt a single, 
market-friendly format geared towards attracting a specific audience--particularly New Haven's captive black urban populace. 

Few people know what transpired behind the Executive Office 
doors, but Abdelnaby and Michael Corwin (SM '99), the station's 
General Manager, decided that WYBC would eliminate folk, jazz and 
"Frequency" from its programming, leaving only urban-contemporary, hip-hop and gospel. The decision, in effect, would cut all but 
a handful of student DJs from the roster, leaving a cast of mostly 
black New Haven residents to dominate the station. In an unfortunate slight, though, the Executive Board neglected to tell the DJs
