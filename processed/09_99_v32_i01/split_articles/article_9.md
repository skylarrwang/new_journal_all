Money for Nothing 
Since its conception, the mall planned 
for Long Wharf has been a rich source of 
controversy. Those responsible for attracting the mall and engineering the many 
official contracts and unofficial political 
deals necessary for its construction say that 
the 150-store complex will be a boon to 
New Haven's economic future. They project that the mall will be the source of 
3,000 new retail jobs and a multi-million 
dollar increase in tax revenue. Some, however, predict that the construction of the 
mall will sap the vital flow of commerce 
away from New Haven's downtown area, 
forcing many retailers out of business, leaving behind blighted streets full of empty 
storefronts. The planners' provision for $25 
million (funded by the issuing of bonds) 
for development of New Haven's existing 
commercial areas, therefore, would seem a 
good conciliatory measure. Instead, this 
provision proved to be the most contested 
issue in gaining the approval of the Board 
of Aldermen, perhaps even violating some 
of the principles underlying the existence 
of the board. 

When aldermen met on August 2 to 
vote, item by item, on the motion to 
approve the plans for the mall, most items 
passed with little opposition. But when the 
board arrived at the issue of the money for 
downtown, a long and contentious debate 
erupted. The debate centered on an 
amendment to the item proposed by Ward 
One alderman Julio Gonzale2 (cc '99) and 
Ward Two alderman Jelani Lawson (Me, 
'96). This amendment would have reduced 
the $25 million to $6.5 million in the first 
year, with subsequent additional funding 
dependent upon a careful account of how 
this money was used and the effectiveness 
of this use. The effort to attach the amendment was ultimately unsuccessful; although 
the item passed, over one-third of the 
aldermen present voted against it, by far 
the largest aldermanic opposition to 
emerge against any of the plans for the 
mall. 

Gonzale2 and Lawson support the 
central parts of the mall deal; in fact, they 
were instrumental in engineering a development agreement that emphasizes corporate 
responsibility, requiring the employers 
at the mall to provide such provisions as 
child care and a living wage. They opposed 
the $25 million bonding issue, says 
Gonzalez, because it was fiscally ill-conceived and because the path to its approval 
was procedurally wrong. 

In the early '9os recession, New Haven 
acquired a debt load significantly higher 
than similar cities, largely because of the 
number of bonds it issued. Although the 
city's debt is no longer growing, it still 
spends approximately 10 percent of its tax 
revenue just to pay the interest on its existing debt-the average for comparable cities 
is between 5 and 6 percent. The proposed 
$25 million bond issue will push New 
Haven into even greater debt, which, 
accounting for interest, will eventually cost 
$46 million to repay. The city will pay off 
its debt at a rate of $2 million per year with 
some of the projected tax revenue from the 
mall. Instead of burdening New Haven's 
citizens with more debt, argues Gonzalez, 
the city government should use taxes from 
the mall in a more direct method of financing. For example, if the city used $4 million 
of this new revenue for downtown 
improvements over seven years, it would 
eventually add up to $28 million dollars in 
aid, without the problem of increasing 
New Haven's debt and paying millions of 
dollars in interest. 

The procedural 
objections 
that 
Gonzale2 and Lawson have against the $25 
million bond issue stem from the differences between how it was agreed upon 
compared to the other issues. The development agreement, for example, was discussed at length and in detail, resulting in a 
satisfactory 
agreement on 
corporate 
responsibility. Before the official vote by 
the Board of Aldermen, the entire motion 
regarding the mall was brought before the 
Committee of the Whole, which includes 
all the aldermen, but acts as a more informal forum for discussion and preliminary 
votes. At the time of the committee meeting, however, the mayor's office had not 
proposed a budget for the use of the $25 
million dollars to the aldermen, preventing 
any kind of review or discussion of the use 
of this fund. Finally, at the time of the 
board vote on August 2, the DeStefano 
administration presented a budget with 
only six line items, all of them laughably 
vague, such as "public improvements" and 
"community." A staff of only five aldermen 
and five employees of the mayor's office 
will administer this almost unbudgeted 
fund. 

The procedure by which the $25 million bonding measure gained approval 
seems to defeat the purpose of New 
Haven's Board of Aldermen. Since the city 
is divided into 30 tiny wards, each of which 
elects one alderman, its board is large and 
can cause the legislative process to be cumbersome and lengthy. The reason for representation on such a local scale, despite its 
drawbacks, is that it ensures a much more 
thorough representation of all interests and 
opinions than a system of larger and thus 
fewer districts. When a proposal with such 
a potential impact on the financial future 
of New Haven and its residents is pushed 
through the approval process without full 
opportunity for review, this democratic 
ideal of full representation loses any chance 
of fulfillment. In allowing the shakiest part

of the mayor's pet project to pass with only 
lip service to proper procedure, the silent 
members of the Board represented the 
interests of one: Mayor John DeStefano.
