A
S A NATION TURNED ITS LONELY EYES tO the late Joe 
DiMaggio last March, a nation's tabloids were already 
training their suggestive gaze on his home life. The Yankee 
Clipper's death practically resurrected Marilyn Monroe. And for 
what? My friends, it was to stand in judgment of an American hero's 
sexual stamina. It seems poor Joltin' Joe couldn't make much of a 
spark in the bedroom. Scores of papers dredged up Oscar Levant's 
1955 quip on Monroe and Dimaggio's one-year marriage: "It simply 
proves that no man can be great at two national pastimes." 


DiMaggio, for his part, longed for a more traditional family where 
the woman didn't work (or require sexual satisfaction); he despised 
Marilyn's many gentlemen admirers. 


DiMaggio's tolerance for wives had apparently declined since 
his marriage to actress Dorothy Arnold (though she at least had quit 
her job). But even that hadn't lasted long, either. As Time described 
it in 1946, "Four and a half years, two trips co Reno, and one child." 


And what a child! A sweet little mama's boy named Joseph Jr., 
whom everybody calJed "Joey D." A kid who would have traded all 
Joe Sr.'s titanic exploits for a real father. Yes, I'm afraid the Clipper 
was almost always out to sea. As theN~ Yt1rk Post put it, "Although 
[DiMaggio] was baseball's brightest star, he never had time to play 
catch with his kid." And as usual, amidst eulogies for his father and 
replayings of "Mrs. Robinson," :ilmost everyone forgot about little 
Joey. If it had not been for the vigilant bribery of /nsitk Edition, the 
public would never have heard his side of the story. 


Deborah Norville scooped it straight out of a trailer park. Joey 
was barely 57. but he looked old enough to be his father. His nose 
glowed red against his white crew cut and pale cheeks. He was sit-
ting on a stool outside his mobile home, next co a pile of trash. And 
though I don't recall exactly what he said, his voice quavering. it was 
something along the lines of, "Surprisingly. I'm pretty happy here." 


That alone might have been impressive enough. But what really hit 
home was what he refused to talk about. His estranged wife and her 
two daughters, for one. His father, too, for the most part. Joey D. 
had been a pallbearer at the funeral. He'd loved his father, he said-
but they hadn't seen each other much. He supposed Joe Sr. was dis-
appointed in him. What was he doing. the heir to a fortune, work-
ing in a trash heap? "I don't rt"ally want to talk about it." Only then 
did Deborah throw us a real curve: this junkyard dog of a man, it 
turns out, attended Yale College. 


What happened? 


There was never enough room for Joey in the mansions of his 
youth. He was born in 1941, the year of his father's 56-game hitting 
streak. His parentS were divorced by the time he was three, and even 
before that, they hadn't been much of a family. After the break-up, 
little Joe was sent off to boarding school, then military school, and


back to boarding school. He finished at New Jersey's prestigious 
Lawrenceville Academy and entered Yale in 1961, where he seems to 
have had a relatively unremarkable freshman year. In 1962., feeling 
inadequate, he dropped out and joined the Marines. 


During this period, h.t and his new step-mom, Marilyn 
Monroe, became almost indecently close Qoe Sr. is said to have 
been jealous-which was almost certa,inly the desired effect). Joey 
called her collect practically every day. They s~ke three times, in 
fact, the day before she died. Her death devastated Little Joey, 
according to the Post. It completely foiled his uncommonly strong 
Oedipal complex; he'd failed to keep his mother alive, and his 
father's giant stature still loomed above him. 


In 1968, he reluctantly accepted some help from daddy and 
surrendered to domesticity. Joe Sr. set him up in the polyurethane 
foam business (one word, son: plastics). Soon afterwards, Joey mar-
ried Sue Adams. Still crippled by self-doubt, he failed at both mar-
riage and business with prodigious speed. He was drinking a ton, 
and occasionally indulged in speed. He would come home drunk 
and beat Sue bloody. He soon struck out in the foam business, and 
was divorced in 1974-


Even when Joe Sr. was dying. he refused to visit him. Big Joe's 
cousin SteUa told reporters Joey wanted to go, would have gone, 
even, if only his father had invited him. But the Yankee Clipper did 
not invite him. He died without saying good-bye to his life's great-
est disappointment. 


Joey didn't emerge again until Jnsitk Edition found him early 
this year. Joe Sr.'s death seemed to reopen the possibility of life for 
Joey D. He was talking about maybe going back into business, quit-
ting alcohol, and putting his life back together. Things were really 
starting to look up for Joltin' Junior. 


But Joey D. was unable to exorcise the specter of his father. A 
few months after he resolved to resuscitate his ambitions, he was 
still living in a trailer park. still drinking and still reclusive as ever. 
That was where be died, on August 9th, scarcely five months after 
Joe Sr. The causes were "natural." Acute asthma, the doetors said. 


But as his ex-wife told the SAn Diego Union-Tribune, "I think he 
just gave up." 


With Joe Sr.'s death, Joey D.'s existence was finally his own-
and aJ1 he could do was give up. He ruined his own life, one sus-
pects. as an elaborate revenge against a distant, intimidating father. 
A lonely death was all that was left to him. He'd refused his old 
man's "traditional family." In this, at least, he was a srunning suc--
cess.
