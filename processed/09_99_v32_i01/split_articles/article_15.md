Labor Ready finds jobs for New Haven's down and out, 
but whose interests does it really serve?

D 
UANE'S FATHER, AN .ARKANsAS SHARECROPPER, came tO 
New Haven to escape the hopeless economic prospects 
back home. An unskilled worker, he was able to find a 
steady job as a metal worker in a union shop in the North. Today 
he is retired with a pension. Ironically, in present-day New Haven, 
Duane faces the same economic desperation his father faced down 
South. 

I met Duane at 5=30 in the morning at the new Labor Ready 
branch on Chapel Street. At that hour, even the Dunkin' Donuts on 
the corner had yet to open. Labor Ready is a national chain of temp 
agencies specializing in unskilled and low-skilled workers. Duane 
was one of the hopefuls who went there looking for work the morn-
ing I dropped by. 

At dawn, seven days a week, workers show up in front of the 
store. Most are young African-American men like Duane, though a 
grandmotherly looking black woman and a number of Latinos were 
there that morning as well. The man behind the counter was white 
and wore the unofficial uniform of all middle managers--a dress


lbirt, tic and a pair of Dockers. Duane and the others signed in at 
S:JO AM in the hope of getting an opportunity to work for an aver-
IF of $6.30 an hour (about $SO a day before taxes), minw twO to 
cbrec dollars for transportation and two dollars for required equip-
ment (like gloves). At the end of the day, cashing checks at the ATM 
in the office will take another $1.50 out of the men's pay and back 
into Labor Ready's coffers. The glossy management newsletter gives 
updates on which branches have the highest percentage of workers 
llling the ATMS, interspersed with inspirational quotations from 
1Vas Robcns' bcstsdlcr u44ership S«rns of Ani/4 the Hun. 

Duane had worked through Labor Ready for the past few days 
doing demolition work at the old SNET building downtown, but he 
llill had to show up at six to notify the manager that he was willing 
ID work again today. Labor Ready hires only one day at a time and 
~~quires all workers to arrive by six so they can get to work on time. 
That Duane's work was only a ten minute walk from the store did 
1a0t merit an cxccption. Employment is stricdy daily and, as far as 
t.bor Ready is concerned, the day StartS at six sharp and ends with

a paycheck. "I call it the economic principle of beer," CI!O Glen 
Wdstad told For!Hs magazine, believing that most of his loyal 
employees work solely to pay for their nighdy alcohol fix. "Work 
Today, Paid Today" is the company slogan. At least the one they dis-
play to workers. To potential clients the slogan is "Temporary 
Labor-On Demand." 

Labor Ready recruits its clients through telemarketing. asking 
companies large and small whether they have need of readily dis-
posable workers. Labor Ready's branch managers say they start cold 
calling at s AM each day; in company literature, CI!O Wdstad 
promises that "if you arc not 100 percent satisfied with the work 
performed by an individual, notify Labor Ready within the first 
two-hour period-you won't be billed for their time and we will 
assign you a replacement worker.• Labor Ready ac:ts as the direct 
employer, making it liable for payroll taxes and workers' compensa-
tion should anyone get hurt. (A sign at the Chapel Street office 
proudly proclaimed that it has not had an accident in 39 days.) 

Clients simply pay Labor Ready a fcc, at least twice what each


5:15AM 
Even though Labor Ready officially opens for 
buslneas at six In the morning, the real line, as 
veterans will tall you, begins outside at 5:30, 
sometimes even earlier. At 5:15, there are already 
six names on the list of. thosa willing to work. The 
lucky first, Sean, arrived today at 4:30. But even 
Sean Is not guaranteed a job. In fact, he will sit 
hera today almost as long as I will. 

The drill at any of Labor Ready's hundreds 
of offices nationwide Ia the same. After putting 
your nama down on the sign-In sheet, all you can 
do Is walt. And the walt, as you learn, Is what 
saparatas those who will work today from thosa 
who will not. 

Today Is my third cllly at Labor Ready.

Behind the Imposing gray desk alta Chris, the 
Chapel Street office manager, taking each Infre-

greeting: "Thank you for calling Labor Ready, 
working savan days a weak." Besides me, he Ia

according to him, are surprising, arriving along-

worker gets paid, and tell the workers what to do. According to 
branch managers, most New Haven clients are small businesses, 
though larger ones, like Yale, which uses Labor Ready workers for 
housekeeping, come calling as well. 

But where do all the workers come from? New Haven is home 
to two of Labor Ready's over 6oo storefronts. One is located on 
Grand Avenue right down the street from a homeless shelter. The 
second-the Chapel Street location-was opened to attract those 
who spend their nights on the Green. The official corporate litera-
ture covers up their workers' situations with statements like 
"Whether you're off for the summer, worlcing part time, or just 
want to make a few extra dollars on evenings or weekends, we can 
make it happen." This list of categories did not appear to fit any of 
the workers I saw. Labor Ready's public relations department may 
have the luxury of harboring such intentional misconceptions, but 
the local New Haven management do not. As former branch man-
ager Norm Slifkin put it, "the majority of the people working here 
are hand-to-mouth." The new Chapel Street branch manager, Chris 
18 
Peterson, put it even more blundy. "Ifl need 100 people here on an 
hour's notice, I can do that," he said proudly. "How?" I asked. 
"Easy. Call the battered women's shelter." 

Along with using such vulnerable people comes the temptation 
to exploit them--even beyond the fullest extent of the law. A recent 
Department of Labor investigation of a Labor Ready branch in 
New London resulted in nearly s1o,ooo in fines for rune violations, 
including failure to pay wages on time and charging illegal trans-
portation fees. In only the first half of this year, the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration has investigated eleven accidents 
at Labor Ready and filed 23 reports on the company. 

Despite facts like these, which might suggest to the uninitiat-
ed that Labor Ready treats its workers-or "raw material" as a 
recent Forb~s company profile put it-like, well, raw material, the: 
branch managers I spoke with claim quite the opposite. According 
to Southern Connecticut District Manager Bill Welch, "Other 
operations that do what we do treat their workers like din. They 
have bulletproof glass up and the workers push the paperwork
