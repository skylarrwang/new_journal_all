Bidding Love Goodbye 
From her first-year suite in Vanderbilt 
Hall on Old Campus, Joyce Maynard carried on a notorious love affair: Maynard, 
then 18 years old, traded letters and eventually moved in with then-53-year-old J. D. 
Salinger-who was known as much for his 
reclusiveness as for The Catcher in the Rye. 
Though the relationship lasted little more 
than a year, its last vestiges-the ownership 
rights of the fourteen letters Salinger wrote 
to Maynard-were not laid to rest until 
this past summer, when Maynard auctioned them off at Sotheby's New York to 
raise money for her children's college 
tuition. 

Maynard first gained public attention 
with "An 18-Year-Old Looks Back on Life," 
her cover story of the April 23, 1972 issue of 
the New York Times Magazine. Two days 
after the story appeared, Maynard received 
a letter postmarked Cornish, New 
Hampshire, the hamlet where Salinger had 
lived when his writing propelled him 
into the public eye. The letters continued 
throughout the summer and Maynard's 
first semester at Yale. Maynard and Salinger 
exchanged thoughts but more importantly, 
perhaps, they exchanged telephone numbers and shared their excitement about possibly meeting each other in the near future. 

That meeting took place in early 1973, 
after which Maynard dropped out of Yale 
to move in with Salinger. The relationship 
became strained shortly thereafter. "I struggled to meet his expectations that I detach 
myself from worldly things and from the 
clamor of voices around me." Maynard 
wrote in a confessional essay for the 
Internet publication Y-Life Magazine in 
September 1998. "I communicated with 
almost nobody but Jerry Salinger." In 
March 1973, Maynard moved out. Though 
the two still corresponded, the letters 
became less frequent and decidedly chillier. 
In his last letter, dated August 17, 1973, 
Salinger ended the relationship. 

Maynard did not discuss her love affair 
with Salinger publicly for nearly 30 years. 
But in her 1998 memoir, At Home in the 
World, she exposed to the public the details 
of the relationship. Maynard received a 
great deal of public criticism for breaching 
the sanctity of her relationship with 
Salinger by exploiting the details of it for 
financial gain. Furthermore, Salinger's reputation as a recluse swayed public opinion 
against Maynard. In the years prior to the 
publication of Maynard's memoir, Salinger 
had fought to keep quotations from his letters to friends out of a biography and to 
stop the screening of an Iranian film adaptation of his book Franny and Zooey. He 
succeeded both times. 

When Maynard announced early in 
1999 that she intended to auction off the 
letters she had received from Salinger, however, the author took no steps to prevent 
her from doing so. Since the letters were 
not to be published, and since the applications of copyright and invasion of privacy 
laws are limited, Salinger could not take 
legal action. The auction, scheduled for 
June 22, presented the biggest threat to the 
shell Salinger had hidden in for so long. 

Fortunately for Salinger, someone 
understood his need and wish for privacy. 
Software magnate Peter Norton purchased 
the batch of letters for $156,500, nearly 
twice the pre-auction estimate. Soon after, 
Norton returned the letters to Salinger. "I 
share the widely expressed opinion that the 
work should be bought by someone sympathetic to Mr. Salinger's desire for privacy," Norton said in a public statement. 

With all parties contented, a love story 
whose legend had long outlasted the love 
itself came to its long-awaited end.
