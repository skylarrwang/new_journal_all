EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
As I join the ranks of rising juniors departing from the residential college system next year, I can feel my cool points surging daily:. Moving off campus is hip: It means house parties, halogen lights and closets that can hold more than two hangers. Unfortunately, it also means handling my own meals a step towards adulthood I'm not quite ready to take. After calculating that ordering takeout every night next year would slash through my meager savings in about three weeks, I vowed to teach myself to cook. 
It didn't go well. 

Consequently, I've devised an innovative approach to off-campus dining that combines frugality and culinary exertion: free food. Like the tight-fisted uncle who scarfs down an entire basket of corn chips at a Mexican restaurant, I plan to reduce spending by increasing sampling. After serious field work; including polling the homeless, I decided to put my plan to the test by embarking on a one-day mooching spree. Twenty-four hours, no dining halls, zero purchased food: one hundred percent fare gratis. 

My penny-pinching adventure began at midnight, and I was prepared. At 12:01, I hunched over a garbage bag outside Atticus Bookstore and Cafe, hoping to scrounge up enough sustenance to get me through the next day. But the next morning, I awoke twenty minutes before my first class to find that all that remained of my roasted garlic ciabatta loaf was a gnawed crust of bread. 
One of my roommates walked by and said apologetically. 
"Sorry ... we got hungry last night. It's not like you paid for it." 

After grazing on the meager remains of my loaf throughout Spanish, I sidled into Au Bon Pain and nonchalantly asked for soup samples of Jamaican black bean and minestrone. The chef, a heavy-set woman with a faint moustache, handed me two shot-glass-sized cups filled to the brim. I downed them, wrinkled my nose, and kindly requested the chicken florentine. But before I could plead for chowder, she rolled her eyes and walked away. I licked my lips and crawled out like the rat that I was. 

After staring at a box of graham crackers in my room (pre-purchased and thus forbidden) for half an hour, I decided it was time for dessert. I happily noted that one of the more hippie-like Ashley's employees was at the counter so I asked for a taste of cinnamon ice cream. 
He handed me a spoonful the size of a fingernail. 
I frowned at it, then nibbled slowly. A thousand of these samples wouldn't get me anywhere. I had to hurry to reach Tasti DLite before class, so I darted out of Ashley's with a vision of waffle cones teeming with creamy sorbet. When I reached Tasti-D, I breathlessly asked to try all four flavors: 

The condiment cups were fairly sizeable (about three spoonfuls each), and I lined them up on the only bench in the stark room. While the cashiers watched, I slowly sucked the contents of the Tiramisu sample, ignoring the chemical aftertaste. I shivered with pleasure, then glanced at the door, hoping a new customer would distract the workers. No such luck. They watched me with repulsed fascination, and I pretended not to notice. After downing the fourth cup, I touched the phone in my bag and rattled it as though it were vibrating. 
"Uh, phone call. Be right back. To buy something." The cashiers stared in disbelief. 
I stumbled over the bench and out the door, then dashed into class on the heels of my sugar intake. Seven minutes later, my stomach began to rumble like a rusty carburetor. 

Folie a deux, I scribbled furiously, trying to suppress the roar. Pyramus and Thisbe. The professor's head had morphed into a doughy dinner roll. I blinked, and it was suddenly patted with melted butter. I bolted. 

With a list in my hand and nothing in my stomach, I hit all of the spots on my itinerary within an hour. Animal crackers and coffee at Ten Thousand Villages; shortbread and strawberries at Wave Gallery. I knew there was a Master's Tea in Swing Space at four, so I slunk by when the lecture began, nabbing a few cubes of cheddar, a handful of crackers and an Oreo. One of the master's aides politely coughed. I snarled. 

After reading take-out menus and watching the Food Network for an hour and a half it was six, and I had run out of options. I had planned on holding out for ABP's day-old pastries at 11, but the wait seemed interminable. My next move was clear: I had to sneak into a dining hall. I chose JE for its overall squalor, and casually walked in towards the baked goods, as though I had already swiped. Just as I was about to inhale an organic brownie, I felt a hand on my shoulder. 
"Did you 

Panicked, I dropped the brownie and sprinted out, realizing too late that my assailant was a classmate, not a dining hall worker. I slowed down and began walking home, then stopped on the corner of York and Elm. The scent of the burrito cart, in all of its chili-pepper-panted, salsa-playing glory, wafted across the street. I watched the burrito man stuff a tortilla with rice and black beans, and burned with jealousy when I saw the smarmy expressions of the kids in line. 

Such hunger makes one irrational. I darted across the street, sneaked up to a lacrosse player, and reached for his fresh, steam-foil-wrapped burrito. His eyes widened with fear. I lunged. 
Stealing, after all, doesn't cost a dime.

I don't want to work for The New Journal! I have better things to do with my time than work for a magazine that has received every major writing prize at Yale as well as the Rolling Stone College Journalism Award. 
Besides, you and I both know that The New Journal is just a training ground for media types like TNJ founder, and Pulitzer Prize winner, Daniel Yergin or past TNJ staffer, and editor of the Chicago Tribune, Jack Fuller. 

And you think just because The New Journal is the oldest magazine at Yale and also has the largest circulation, I'm supposed to be impressed? Give me some credit. So, I beg of you, go ask someone who cares. 

Well, I'd love to help you! The New Journal is looking for innovative writers, DTP demigods, cutting-edge designers, dynamic photographers, artistes extraordinaires, business tycoons, and interested/interesting Yalies in general.
