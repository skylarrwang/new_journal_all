vacuum tubes twist down from the 
ceiling. "Oh, elephant trunks," says 
Anya Shutov, a pretty, puckish intern 
in her last year of graduate study at 
Winterthur, describing the ventila-
tion system which sucks up toxic 
gases from solvents. The painting lab 
hosts the same plethora of chemistry 
equipment as the other conservation 
labs, but everything here is on a larg-
er scale 
hence the overwhelming 
trunk-vacuums. 

Shutov shows off the canvases 
undergoing treatment. 
She points 
out paintings that Aronson has been 
cosmetically altering by cleaning and 
inpainting 
carefully painting over 
the canvas to even out hue or miss-
ing detail. Three rosy, fleshy women 
and an angel need to be cleaned. So 
does the vast, cloudy sky overlooking 
British gentlemen on a foxhunt. 

Next, Shutov pauses in front of her 
own biggest project, an arresting 
painting of a dark, thin brunette star-
ing miserably out of a canvas in mis-
erable shape. Over the course of her 
internship Shutov has worked to 
improve the condition of the painting, 
if not the expression of the girl. This 
is a portrait of Artemesia, who has 
reason to look so sad: She's just eaten 
a potion that includes the ashes of her 
recently deceased husband, out of her 
profound love for hirn. The artist is an 
unknown 17th-century Florentine. 

Using UV light and X-rays, Shutov 
can see where the painting has been 
previously restored and where white 
lead paint has been used. She can also 
see where the canvas has been 
stretched and where the originally rec-· 
tangular painting sacrificed its corners 
for an octagonal frame. A conservator 
before Shutov attached new corners. 
Shutov stripped the paint from these 
areas to reveal an outrageously clash-
ing leopard-print pattern, which she 
has decided to keep because "that's 
doing less, not more" 
a principle all 
conservators keep in tnind. Because 
the watercolors that previous conser-

vators used on Artemesia have faded, 
Shutov uses more colorfast but equal-
ly removable polyvinyl-acetate paints 
to inpaint. At every stage of her work 
the intern docuinents her progress 
with digital photos to ease and inform 
the job of future conservators. 

Eventually this painting will join the 
permanent collection. 

In the case of the painting of 
Artemesia, conservators .cannot con-
sult with the artist to confirm his 
original intent. But with contempo-
rary art they can; and thus, some 
controversy may be averted. For 
example, Anselm Kiefer, a - living 
artist, paints with lead that quickly 
turns to powder, and incorporates 
fern leaves that turn brown and fall 
off as well as sunflower seeds that 
inevitably scatter on the gallery's 
floors. A conservator who is unsure 
whether this predictable deteriora-
tion is part of Kiefer's intended 
effect may contact and consult with 
hirn about his wishes. Aronson's own 
experience 
with 
living 
artists 
includes 
tackling a 
frame 
that 
became infested by tern1ites. The 
conservator called the painter to 
deterrnine if the frame was special 
and should ~us be repaired. Her 
response was immediate: "Get rid of 
the frame and the painting! Send it 
back to me and I'll give you a better 
one!" Aronson ended up replacing 
the frame, and the YUAG curator is 
still deliberating whether or not t.o 
exchang the painting. 

Most of Yale's paintings, however, 
are .the legacies of artists no longer 
alive, and in conserving these paint-
ings, Aronson and his staff must 
make judicious choices about the 
artists' intents. Their decisions, and 
those of their colleagues around the 
world, can result in intense disagree-
ment, such as the feud that recently 
resulted 
from 
the 
cleaning of 
Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceilitig. 

While painting conservation may 
be the most controversial of preser-
vation fields, those 'who work in it 
receive no more glory than Noack or 
Harris in book restoration. In fact, -
what is striking and cheering about 
the staff of Yale's book and art 
preservation departments is that they 
all labor out of their love and respect 
for the artwork's integrity and for the 
artists' intents. They do not often 
curate flashy shows; they do not 
enjoy the renown of star professors 
who 
draw 
on 
preservers' 
research, nor do they rise to the fame 
of the writers and artists whose 
works they preserve. Rather, the 
caretakers of Yale's library holdings 
and paintings act behind the scenes 
to mend and maintain these treasures 
as valuable, if not as permanent, as 
the seven Dwarves' diamonds. For 
their efforts the caretakers reap the 
satisfaction of ensuring that these 
artifacts will outlive them and con-
tinue to edify and inspire future 
inheritors of the world's culture.
