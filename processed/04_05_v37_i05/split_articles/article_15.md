Since then, the Board of Aldermen 
has drawn up an official procedure 
for the naming of corners, which 
Albert Lucas, longtime head of the 
Board of Aldermen office, calls "rel-
atively simple." Gathering signatures 
of local businesses and residents is 
the flrst step, after which, with leg-
islative support, the item appears 
before two committees: Municipal 
Services ·and City Planning. If it is 
recommended, the entire Board 
votes on the ·measure. Once the 
aldermen unanimously approve, the 
mayor and the city clerk must sign 
off. Only then does the order make it 
to Trafflc and Parking, where, for 7 5 
to 100 taxpayer dollars, a new sign 
is born. 

These official regulations, still little 
more than a few handwritten phras-
es, sit in a drawer in the Board of 
Aldermen office, the administrative 
heart of the city. Here, the offlce's 
employees 
human encyclopedias of 
New Haven history 
remember the 
naming of Bishop Tutu corner and 
every street sign since the more 
recent craze. While each aldermanic 
term lasts two years, the historic·al 
memory of this . office lasts much 
longer. The e.mployees understand 
why the regulations were put in 
place. They know that rewriting his-
tory and changing the names of 
streets can honor one person's con-
tribution to the city while erasing 
' . 
another's.

AIDS 
Interfaith, Elsie Cofield no longer 
plays an active role in the organiza-
tion she founded. While others pro-
vide medical support and counseling 
to New Haven's HIV population, 
twice a day Cofield makes the 
rounds in the building, giving every-
one a hug. When she started AIDS 
Interfaith 18 years ago, however, her 
clients needed much more than 
hugs. She fought to provide them 
with basic services 
even wheel-
chairs 
at a time when many people 
shrunk from the taboo of the 
disease. 

Cofield became part of New 
Haven's history in 1966, when the

husband, Dr. Curtis Cofield III, to 
lead its congregation. The family left 
North Carolina and settled in the 
Elm City. First as a minister's wife, 
then as a teacher, Cofleld began to 
change the community .. She 
r~n.:: 
pageants, youth groups and soup 
kitchens out of the church;· in effect, 
. she raised half of the city's children. 
Her 
most lasting 
contribution, 
though, was her AIDS work, which 
educated New Haven's healthy and 
cared for its sick. 

When Alvis Brooker, a former stu-
dent of Colfield's, was elected to the 
Board of Aldermen, naming street 
signs was in vogue, and he remem-
bered his elementary school teacher. 
On May 27, 2001, Cofleld stood out-
side AIDS Interfaith, amid the whis-
tles and cheers of friends and admir-
ers. This small alley, 'once named Gill 
for a reason its residents could not 
remember, ·became Elsie Cofield 
Way for a reason they ·could. 

Unlike most of the Board's street 
signs, Elise Cofleld Way renamed the 
street in its entirety over the objec-
tions of the family of George Gill, . 
whom the street had originally com-
memorated. Gill, a stucco plasterer 
and local businessman, was a relic of 
a previous century. Just as present 
communities 
had 
resented 
Register's assertion that their icons 
didn't matter, the heirs of a more 
distant past felt slighted by the 
Board's disregard for their role in 
New Haven's history. 

Even Cofield is unsure why the 
Board changed the street name. She. 
certainly does not lack for recogni-
tion for her work. Plaques clutter the 
walls of her office and spill into the 
adjoining room, already full of arti-
cles, clippings and awards. On her 
desk, a picture of Cofield beneath 
her sign is overshadowed by a shot 
of her standing next to a grinning 
President Clinton. 

Although she passes her sign every 
day, "I don't think about it," she said.

ven · with guidelines in place, 
the controversy ·over public 
memorials lingers. With New 
Haven's many honorable citi-:-
zens both past and present, the 
Board must somehow decide who 
deserves to see his or her name, if

To Suzanna, there is no question 
that the Horowitz brothers deserve 
recognition. She has been friends 
with Hilda Horowitz for years and 
found -her husband Phil to be "a 
wonderfully, 
exceptionally 
nice 
man." When he died a year and a half 
ago, Suzanna was among the crowd 
of mourners who listened as the 
rabbi claimed, "If there were Jewish 
saints, Phil would have been one of 
them." It was then, that Suzanna 
began to wonder how the city could 
pay the family tribute. 

Street sign proposals often begin 
with an individual simply looking to 
honor a friend or colleague. Such 
grassroots sentiment _gtves street 
signs their power as symbols, but has 
also been the most common source 
of their controversy. Those in power 
can more easily honor the people 
they care about . 

Without an initial connection to 
the Board, Suzanna struggled to 
push her idea forward. At one point, 
she said, someone whom she had 
tried to contact seemed hostile to her 
proposal and had vaguely suggested 
that the fatnily was making a hefty 
profit on the sale of the building. 

Bitsie Clark, the Alderwon1an for 
Ward 7 
lower Chapel Street 
was 
supportive, but as she wrote Romy in 
December, "There is -a need for a 
groundswell of people to push for 
some way to honor the store.

stgn requues 
tephen J. Papa, Sr. has some 
ideas about how to make 
politicians notice him. He's 
been doing. it for years. 

One day in October, Papa came . 
home and found that thieves had 
broken through the backdoor and 
taken some of Mrs. Papa's jewelry 
with them. But they had also dis-
turbed Papa's most treasured sanctu-
ary 
a room . full of newspapers. 
("My name was on the front cover of 
the Register two days ago," he chor-
tled.) The thieves shuffled through 
decades worth of newspaper clip-
pings, became frustrated and hit the 
wall so hard it cracked. Papa doesn't 
know what they were looking for. 

Amid the pile of New Raven's histo-
ry in headlines: "Papa founds the 
Dwight Redevelopment .Agency," 
"Papa wrangles with a teacher's 
union ready to walk off the · job," 
"Papa is appointed to the Board of 
dance what Suzanna lacked. 

"I was here one day and my grand-
son called me up, 'You have to come 
down to our store,' he said. When I 
went outside, the mayor, the con-
gress lady, the president of St. 
Raphael's were all there. I thought 
something had happened!" 

It had. In the middle of the crowd

an octogenarian with a scrag-
gly beard, sitting with his cane and 
bum hip an his easy chair. But Papa 
is rarely at home. · "My schedule fills 
up so darn fast,'! he said. "All volun-
teer, thousands of hours, and when I 
tell you thousands, I mean many 
many hours." Most recently, Papa has 
been spending time talking to 
patients at St. Raphael's Hospital. In 
his opinion every corner of the city 
could benefit from what his grand-
green beacon floated. "Stephen ]. 
Papa Corner," it read. "I actually 
cried,'' Papa said, but then he sat 
back, thoughtfully. "I don't know 
how they kept it from me. ... I have so 
many connections!"

man about town, for most of 
her life, Suzanna was not

"I am Santa Claus," Papa chuckled. 
Come December, children start ring-

the days before Christmas. Had the 
thieves found Papa at home tha~

After all these years, Papa has 
learned how to make people listen to 
hin1 and his criticisms. Papa is the 
model of a street sign honoree: an 
individual who believes he can sin-
gle-handedly change the city. A ruth-
less self-promoter, he has in abun-
