involved in city business. But once 
she started, she was determined to 
effect change by seeing Horowitz 
Brothers Corner become a reality. 
"Why shouldn't I accomplish it?" -
she asked. "People are able to make 
changes. Why shouldn't I be able to 
make this little change?" 

In January, when Romy returned 
for spring semester, she and Suzanna 
presented their collection of signa-
tures 
the "groundswell" they need-
ed 
to an excited Bitsie Clark. Her 
hefty political clout paid off. Faster 
. than they had believed possible, con-
sidering the original resistance from 
< 
City Hall, their measure jumped 
through the requisite hurdles and 
committees with Clark's enthusiastic 
and seasoned hand behind it. On 
February 21, 2005, more than a year 
after Phil Horowitz's funeral, Romy 
and Suzanna sat in the Board cham-
ber itself for a prelinunary approval 
hearing 
before 
the 
Municipal 
Services Committee. 

Under the hall's sweeping ceilings, 
they waited as a bustling crowd of 
tniddle-aged ladies gathered towards 
the rear of the Aldermanic Chamber. 
Suzanna 
flitted 
about, 
cheeks 
flushed, chatting with friends and 
strangers who had all come to speak 
in support of her proposal. Bitsie 
Clark, raving about the positive feed-
back from other aldermen, looked 
impressed by the turn-out. 
Romy 
kept a hand on Suzanna's shoulder as 
they rehearsed her lines, encouraging 
her to enunciate so the board could 
hear her touching tribute through 
her 
thick 
Hungarian 
accent. 
Suzanna's wiry husband, a Yale sci-
entist, smiled as he watched. Even 
Hilda Horowitz had snuck in "incog-
nito," to witness the realization of 
her friend's obsession. 

One woman after another rose to 
speak on behalf of the Horowitz 
brothers. A 
long-titne employee 
commended the brothers for a 
strong tradition of women's employ-
ment, another lauded their kind-
ness to animals, another, nearly in 
• 
tears, told the committee she had· 
bought the fabric for her wedding 
chuppah at the store. Suzanna and 
Romy spoke last. 
Visibly moved, 
Alderwoman 
Rose 
Ferraro 
Santana, the chairperson of the 
Committee, effusively thanked the 
well-wishers. 
month later, Bitsie Clark's 
proposal is number 12 on the 
docket. Stuffed among other 
municipal 
suppliants, the 
small 
Horowitz 
contingency 
Romy, 
Suzanna, Art and Hilda Horowitz 
and -friends 
is clumped together, 
eagerly awaiting their item. Romy 
whispers to Suzanna, "This is it." A 
nervous Suzanna hugs her. 
Four 
aldermen besides Clark speak in 
favor of the measure, and when Carl 
Goldfield, Ward 29, concludes with, 
"This shirt, this tie, this belt: all from 
Horowitz Bros.!" he takes his seat to 
a roar of applause. 

Waiting for silence, President Jorge 
Perez asks for a vote: "All in favor?" 

n April 29 at 5:30 p.m., a 
small sign will be unveiled, 
and a crowd of well-wish-
ers including Mayor John D. Stefano 
and Congresswoman Rosa DeLaura, 
will see Horowitz Brothers Corner's 
inauguration. With a chorus of ayes 
that night in March, the Board of 
Aldermen made Suzanna's dream a 
rea~tj. The sign will be at the head 
of a long list of names that line 
Chapel Street: not only Stephen Papa 
and Elsie Cofield, but Evelyn Schatz, 
a community activist; Sidney and 
Libby Glucksman, Holocaust sur-
vivors and long-time owners of 
Sidney's Tailoring; and the Reverend 
Curtis Cofield III, Elsie's husband. 
Chapel Street has a particularly high 
concentration of signs 
but signs 
can · be found all over New Haven. 
They weave a web of names and his-
tory around the cars and pedestrians. 
No map or comprehensive list of 
signs exists, and most likely no one 
knows for sure how many there are. 
But for the communities -and individ-
uals that the signs honor, they are 
badges of New Haven's best faces .. 
the citizens who believe in the city. 
While New Raven's past recedes and 
new faces change the city, the street 
signs will stand above our heads, a 
gentle reminder of the people who 
ca.re for New Haven, and the people 
who care about them. This is New 
Haven's Hall of Fame, and the 
Horowitz Brothers Corner sign will 
mark not just the brothers' place, but 
Suzanna's.
