seem heavy; but up close, distortions, 
flaws and the hammer marks that sized 
and shaped the lead are apparent. As a 
result, the painted parts of the windows 
are confmed to legal pad-sized ditnen-
sions, and the rest of the window is 
composed of clear or mildly tinted 
glass, all from 'France. The paintings are 
detailed with the "stick-work" tech-
nique;which entails outlining the image 
with a dark brown paint, staining the 
opposite side of the glass with a wash 
and fu:ing the panel to bond the paint 
to the glass. The panel is then mounted 
in lead earning with the stained part fac-
ing 
outward, 
and 
the 
window 
is installed. 
Unfortunately, lead cames are· soft 
and seep down to the bottom of the 
structure over time, deforming the glass 
by creating a concave or convex effect. 
This causes gaps between the glass and 
the cames. The result is an ineffective 
way to insulate the building, and occa-
sionally 
the windows · have 
been 
removed to hammer the lead back out 
and create flatter windows. lri the cli-
mate-controlled stacks, new rubber-
sealed glass has been installed a few 
inches from the original window. But 
the flawlessness of the factory-made 
glass is an aesthetic flaw 
it can never 
be as attractive as the original uncased 
window. 


It seems fitting that Yale possesses 
windows that predate the concept of 
climate control. Rogers is famous for 
trying to make Yale look old, and in 
SML, his "cathedral of learning," he 
created niches for statues that never 
existed and disguised the elevator 
machinery on the roof as a turreted 
French pavilion. Bonawit responded by 
crafting patina window images that 
look aged, and slicing many of his 
images with "mending lead," which 
thoughtfully avoided the most impor-
tant parts of Bonawit's paintings. 
Bonawit blended Collegiate Gothic 
with the then-trendy Art Deco style by 
reinterpreting classical images with 
modern movernent and composition. 
He designed every window that now 
separates the Periodicals room from the 
Music Ubrary, and the characters in the


room Jump, sway 
and run with new 
life across the six 
window bays. The 
poses and motions 
of the mythic fig-
ures are modern: 
October, a sinewy 
young 
fellow, 
is 
folded 
in 
half 
like an innovative 
Pilobolus 
dancer, 
peering into a bas-
ket, while April lan-
guidly skips like a 
nine-year old girl 
through a field. 
Bonawit pre-
ferred 
a 
secular 
context 
to 
eccle~iastical, fitr ing 
for a moment in 
history that saw a 
rising interest in the 
painted and stained 
glass windows of 
residences 
schools. He also 
designed the win-
dows for some of 
Yale's older residential colleges, as well 
as 
parts 
of 
Duke, 
Princeton, 
Northwestern and the University of 
Chicago. When designing the windows 
for a church, the subject matter is 
iconographic. But a library hosts a vast 
body of cultural, historical and literary 
knowledge, as a center of creativity and 
innovation. In the academic atmos-
phere of SML, apostles and the Virgin 
Mary would be uncomfortably out of 
place. Thus, the committee decided that 
the windows lining the seminar and 
reading rooms in the stacks should rep-
resent literary characters and historical 
scenes that correspond to each room's 
intended use. The windows of the 
Natural Sciences seminar room display 
a menagerie of birds, fish, reptiles and 
a dragon. The medical study room dis-
plays an apothecary, botanists and a 
doctor in a laboratory. 


But not all rooms still serve the pur-
pose they were intended to when the 
library opened in 1931. When you enter 
room 218, you see a sign on the door·-
it probably says something. like, "Do 
not eat in here," or "Please be respect-
ful of other people in the room." It's in 
Chinese and is not translated. As 
remembered by its windows~ this is the 
East Asia reading room. Korean and 
Japanese characters paint the spine of 
each book; nothing references Western 
culture except the windows. This room 
originally held the Yale Collection of 
Amedcan Literature 
(Y~AL). But 
YCAL grew too large for this modestly-
sized room so it migrated to the 
Beinecke, and the East Asia collection 
set up shop in its place. Today, a student 
scouring a Japanese magazine at the 
lonely wooden table might rest his or 
her eyes on Hiawatha's heavy brow or 
Huck Finn's smirk. A few windows 
over, Ichabod Crane clings to a bony 
horse and speeds through an orange 
autumn forest. Poor Ichabod 
his 
frightened face will never land on his 
own story, much less the language in

which it was written. 
The East Asia reading room is not an 
anomaly; other rooms have mis-
matched windows and subjects as well. 
An example of this discontinuity is 
Room 322, which used to host history 
seminars. The windows narrate the dis-
covery of America and its tumultuous 
consequences. Pizarro's bust peers 
nobly into the room; Columbus stakes 
out the West Indies; and Bostonians 
throw tea into the dark Atlantic Ocean. 
The window paintings chronicle an 
American titneline, but no American 
history books are shelved in here. 
Instead, the books are historiographies 
of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The 
r 
Yale Babylonian Collection now lives in 
322, which houses the United States' 
largest collection of cuneiform inscrip-
tions. In their midst, a glass painting 
exalting the founding of Quinnipiac, 
Connecticut reads, "The wilderness 
shall bloom." One has to read pretty 
far into this backdrop of a boy poring 
over flaky yellowed pages to find a con- · 
nection with the Hittites. 
Down the hall from Yale's 
Babylonian Collection is the African 
Studies Room, a space that Bonawit 
could not have anticipated any more 
than he foresaw the offense caused by · 
Little Black Samba. The rooni's win-
dows are actually devoted to "trans-
portation by water," but perhaps 
"kinds of boats" would be a more fit-
ting description. The first of four win-
dows displays the trireme, a distin-
guished Greek fighting boat. Next to it, 
a two-foot wide strip of wall supports 
a framed photograph of the earth as 
seen from outer space. The next bay 
holds a painted window of the Santa 
Maria, and the next strip of wall dis-
plays 
1994 poster advertising 
"Margins to Mainstream: Lost South 
African Photographers." Then there's 
the clipper ship window. And where 
the Yale Library Gazette claims an ocean 
liner tribute should be painted on the 
glass, there is an air conditioning unit. 
The replacement is a slap in the face 
to Bonawit and Rogers. African Studies 
should not be squeezed into the 
Transportation by Water Room, and 
April2005 
•• 
Bonawit's art should not be replaced by 
an air conditioning unit. These win-
dows are art, and Bonawit devoted 
countless 
hours 
each 
image. 
Disregarding the intent and subject 
matter of the window paintings under-
tnines Rogers and Bonawit's original 
vision. Even if students don't look at 
the windows, even if the use of the 
rooms doesn't correspond to the narra-
tive of the windows, the changes belit-
tle the essence of Bonawit's art. 


Only a few windows share the fate of 
the ocean liner. The saddest window in 
the library is back in the East Asia . 
Reading Room. An image portraying 
Oliver Wendell Holmes' "Autocrat of 
the Breakfast Table" has been replaced 
by a bumpy rectangle of foggy glass 
resting awkwardly in the center of 
the window. 


Of course, windows will break, espe-
cially when they are over seventy years 
old. Anticipating this, Yale has pho-
tographed and documented every win-
dow painting. But no one specializes in 
the art of painting on glass anymore, at 
least not with Bonawit's finesse. And 
when one of his window paintings 
breaks, Yale has no option but to plop 
a plain, occasionally colored window in 
the broken window's place. In the case 
of Samba and his watermelon, the 
University tried to find someone to 
manufacture another window with a 
more appropriate subject, but amidst 
the other images, the book has the 
effect of a baby giraffe trying to walk 
on ice 
surely a misstep. 


s the centerpiece of the library, 
the great hall of SML appropri-
ately devotes its eighty windows 
to the history of Yale and New Haven. 
A student rings Yale's college bell when 
he shouldn't have, and the president of 
the University claps the delinquent's 
ears. Mittened boys gleefully clear snow 
from an Old Campus pathway. And 
then there is the window painting enti-
tled, "Five Sophomores and Freshmen 
steal eight hens from Widow Brockett's 
henhouse, pluck and cook them, and 
are caught in the act of eating them, 
1764." 


One window d~picts two men in what 
a .fourth-grader might call "pilgrim 
hats" standing on a beach, watching a 
ship sail away. This is the Phantom 
Ship, which left the dismal port city of 
New Haven in 1647 laden with goods 
and intellectuals who had the potential 
to save the failing colony. Months 
passed without news of the ship until 
one day, local citizens announced that 
the great ship could be seen on the 
horizon. Residents flocked to the 
beach, and conftrmed that this was 
indeed their ship. They held their vigil, 
watching the ship toss in the choppy 
sea until the main mast appeared to 
break off. The smaller masts followed, 
and the ship rolled over and sank into 
the mist. It was never seen again, and 
no wreckage was found. Now the phan-
tom ship lives only in New Haven leg- -
end, 
painting 
in SML. 


Installing and caring for so many win-
dows requires a great deal of titne and 
labor. Bonawit hoped the effort would 
be justified by a heightened aesthetic 
experience when studying in SML. 
Perhaps, back when the seminar rooms 
still hosted classes, the windows served 
a grander purpose. Students saw them 
every day and studied romance lan-
guages in the satne room that displays 
Moliere's La Malade Imaginaire. But over 
time, new rooms replaced the old as 
history changed the nature of the col-
lections. Now, a dwindling number of 
people climb the stacks and curl up in a 
secluded armchair with a good book 
under a muddied window depicting 
John Locke or an abacus. 


Then again, Bonawit's travails will 
always mean something 
even if only a 
· handful of students stop looking 
through the windows to look at them. 
Rogers and Bonawit wanted Y alies to 
relate to and interact with Yale's archi-
tecture. The entire school is, in that 
sense, a window-painting.
