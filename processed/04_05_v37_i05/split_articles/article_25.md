even women, 
five 
on 
wooden 
stools, 
bright 
lights skimming off a 
shoulder, an arm, illumi-
nating an eye. Two others 
veiled in flittering shadows. Script in 
hand, I listen to the five voices quake 
with fear, undulate with memory, swell 
with grace. Forgetting the reverence 
and propriety usually commanded by 
the walls of a Yale classroom, we set-
tle on our haunches and yank woman-
hood from the script, looking to it for 
what being in fen1inine skin is about. 
Performing the Vagina Monologues 
requires visceral interaction. In a mas-
sive classroom in Street Hall, I begin 
to drown in velvet sentirnent and 
smell the hutnan musk of fen1ininity. 
Fetninine. Fe-male. Fe-Yale. Female 
at Yale. I will be honest. Prior to work-
ing on the Vagina Monologues, my 
thoughts of what it means to be a 
woman on catnpus were flitnsy con-
templations at best. My knowledge 
then was an array of random things-
you-just-know, a jumbled survival 
guide: Leave your dorm alone past ten 
o'clock at your own peril. Drinking at 
frat parties without a watchful gaggle 
of friends can be fatal. Be "one of the 
boys" in academia 
deft and definite 
in your analyses. Keep that skirt to an 
appropriate length 
yop're a Yale 
lady. Speaking of short skirts, watch 
that :reputation. (I once knew a girl 
with an "unacceptable" number of 
male friends; punishment: character 
defamation; accusers: male and fetna1e 
a1ike.) And, in the dicey dance of love, 
April2005 
there's a fme line between loving too 
little and.loving too much (see afore-
mentioned punishment.) 

With these rules in mind, I enlisted 
as a Vagina Warrior. My batde: to help 
coordinate V-week and its culminating 
event, a production of the Vagina 
ever 
zne. 
. Monologues. 

When I was 15, I remember a news 
telecaster announcing in a pritn voice, 
"Playwright Eve Ensler ·brings the 
Vagina Monologues to HBO. More to 
follow on the six o'clock news." Try as 
I might, I could not (perhaps would 
not is more honest) get that word-
"vagina" 
out of my head. My 
Haitian parents never referred to the 
region except when my rnother 
rerninded my sister ·and me to wash 
our "shooshoons" and to keep our 
legs closed so no one could see our. 
"shooshoons." The technical term and 
I weren't formally introduced until 
seventh grade, when my biology 
teacher, Mrs. Coates, threatened to 
k

rna e my c ass say vagtna un 
we 
stopped laughing. At that point, the 
word was a cellar 
secret but neces-
sary. So I was shocked and a little ter-
rified when I heard the word "vagina" 
used in public, under scrutiny in the 
. media harsh spotlight. I had to get my 
hands . on a copy of the play. 
"Pappy, take me to Blockbuster. 
Please?" Surreptitiously, I combed the 
rows until I found the videocassette 
with Eve Ensler sitting atop a stool, 
.. 
her coral :red lips opened in an oval. A 
little like a vagina, I thought. I handed 
the tape to my father, banking on his 
lack of English proficiency to save me 
from mortification. He failed to 
escape embarrassment when the 
cashier 
gave 
him 
a 
fifty-or-so 
Haitian iuunigrant with a copy of the 
Vagina Monologues 
a peculiar look; 
I've since called hit n my first, albeit 
unwilling, feminist. After a litde 
explaining and coaxing, he's formally 
taken on the tide. 

On the tape, what a fen1aJe! At the 
end of Easler's performance, I had 
heard the word "vagina" so many 
times my ears were smarting. After a 
while, the stinging sensation of hear-
ing and thinking about my vagina with 
such intensity faded to a dull buzz. 
Wo-man, woman, womanhood. The 
return to the pitter-patter rhytbtn of 
daily existence dented those thoughts.

Sure, going to an all-girl school helped 
me understand femininity, but this 
fetnininity was new and imperfect. 
Four years later, the email subject 
"Vagina Monologues" delivered a 
shiver of .shock to my body. It's not 
everyday the word "vagina" busts into 
an email subject-line. On that day, 
December 4, 2004, I, Elizabeth, 
signed away my old ways when I hit 
the reply button. I had no clue what I 
was ge~tttng mto. 

Much of the feminist philosophy 
embedded in the script of the Vagina 
Monologues seeks to demystify worp.an-
hood. Ensler's argument is that the 
present environment in which girls are 
raised propagates a stereotype of what 
it means to be a woman. This environ-
ment rejects the diversity of woman-
hood in favor of one "perfect female." 
Consequently, women grow to be 
ashamed of their bodies and sexuality. 
But Ensler frowns on women who 
"masculinize" themselves to be one of 
the boys. Rather, an ideal society 
would recognize differences between 
men and women and respect both 
sexes equally. Ensler's philosophy is 
played up by the shock factor of the 
Vagina Monologues with its shock fac-
tor: The word "vagina" is mentioned 
over thirty tit.nes and each monologue 
is unabashedly provocative. The play 
deconstructs the "perfect woman" to. 
show that fetnininity comes in all 
shapes and sizes. Womanliness has no 
single definition; a woman is what and 
how she chooses to be. 

In spite of having already seen 
Ensler weep, bellow, whisper about 
the female condition, when preparing 
for the Vagina Monologues produc-
tion four years later, I was still no fem-
inist convert. I was certainly awed, and 
perhaps even inspired to inspect my 
own vagina, but I dared not call myself 
a feminist. Ijke other Yale ladies, I had 
begun sentences with, "I'm not a fem-
inist but ... " I liked tny bras, my 
hygiene and my men, thank you very 
much. I couldn't help but be haunted

by visions of unsightly cave women. 
The word seemed outdated, even 
irrelevant considering the voting 
rights, education and access to most 
professions that women had gained in 
the past century. The job was done, 
and the ancient machine which built it 
up ought to be torn down. 

As production started, odd instances 
and facts began to pop out at me. It 
was as though someone had gone 
through and vividly highlighted them 
with a massive yellow marker; certain 
memories, certain places, certain_ facts 
took on a fluorescent glow that I 
could not blithely avoid. 
They 
harkened my eyes and turned my ears 
to hear their call. The warrior (a vagi-
nal one) had heard the battle cry. 
Chit chatter. "Nobody likes her." 
"Did you see her with hitn?" "She 
makes me ·sick." "A slut." Like the 
Democratic Party, I discovered that 
sisterhood is full of factions and 
opposing values. One lady's expecta-
tions are another lady's litnits. For my 
fortunate male counterparts, "slut" 
does not have the same derisive effect. 
He may be relegated the tide "playa," 
but how enticing! He is a Don Juan, 
not a whore. 

To complement sisterhood's internal 
strife, I began to notice what I call the 
desire for self-
· · arion. In one day 
I counted 175 derogatory conunents 
pertaining to weight, hair style and 
looks-a value which averages to 15 
insults per hour. This need to break-
down the self Ensler says, "Is like an 
addiction. You have to tnake that con-
scious effort will you pick up self-
hatred today?" 

In 1969, Yale College accepted its 
first women. That was 73 years after 
Duke, 79 years after Stanford (which 
accepted women &om its inception) 
and 1 04 years after Cornell. The 
stodgy historical figures whose por-
traits overlook my meals are predotni-
nandy male. Like it or not, these fel-
lows shaped Yale's history, and as for-
mer President of Duke and Yale 
alumna, N annerl Keohane succinctly 
noted, the portraits are evidence of 
"who matters around this place." 

A look at the University's academic 
environment shows that only 19 per-
cent of its tenured faculty are female. 
Recent studies observing the class-
room behavior of Yale and Harvard 
students demonstrate that women are 
three titnes more likely to talk with 
professors of the same sex. Men 
spoke two and a half titnes longer 
than women, who were interrupted 
incessantly. Each female student must 
defend herself against male Yale, 
other ladies with viperous tongues 
and, at titnes, herself. 

A week prior to opening night of 
the Vagina Monologues, my friend Cara's 
relationship with her boyfriend was in 
danger. Continuous verbal abuse had 
eroded their mutual respect, and 
words like "bitch" becarne thoughdess 
interjections and insults. Unfounded 
jealousy, accusations and suspicion 
abounded; Cara felt uncomfortable 
and depressed. Prompted by pressure 
from their friends, the two concluded 
that a serious talk was in order. Friday 
evening was the proposed date for a 
conversation, but Michael · chose to 
drink excessively before the scheduled 
discussion and much to our conster-
nation, he became violent and alarm-
ingly belligerent. Michael grabbed 
Cara and they retreated to an undis-
closed location to begin their discus-
sion. I have seldom been as frightened 
for someone's safety. So an anxious 
Seattle native, a liberal Texan and I set 
-
out to find her. We searched through-
out the college, looking in empty 
rooms, the courtyard, even the library, 
in hopes of whisking Cara away from 
irnpending danger. When we found 
them, Cara appeared safe, sitting on a 
' 
chair talking to Michael 
though she 
later confided he had been aggressive-
ly throwing furniture before we 
arrived. The decision they made was 
to remain in a relationship. Frankly, it 
was disappointing to see how trivial

his violence was to her, not to men-
tion his belittling of her womanhood. 
That experience riled the dormant 
feminist within me to notice the con-
ditions that I, like Cara, had come to 
accept. 

On our grand ivy campus I had 
· 
encountered, through Cara, a situa-
tion that I had assumed only existed 
elsewhere. A woman's need to protect 
herself was a moot point, I thought. 
Yet the reality of my fear for Cara was, 
in fact, quite significant. This fear 
roused me from my delusions and I 
began to recognize that the things-
you-just-know were not so implied. 
r 
They ~ere defense mechanism against 
a threatening outside world. 

Easler's voice trembles in front of 
six hundred Yale students: "When 
this world starts respecting our 
women, then this earth will be right 
with itsel£ When we believe in the 
feminine, the course of nature will 
change." In the darkness, I stare up at 
the five women pulsing in red dresses 
and am starded to find that Ensler is 
nearly in tears. We did something 
right. In the same darkness that 
engulfed us every night for rehearsal, 
I understand that performance night 
is my salvation. Six hundred Y alies 
(save a few shy ones) shouted "cunt" 
at the top of their lungs, blessing that 
word. They held the most sacred 
hush I've ever heard in a theater dur-
ing a segment on a Bosnian woman's 
brutal rape. And if I could botde the 
electricity surging through the Yale 
Law School when Molly Fox per-
formed nine different types of sexual 
moans, _ concluding with the nearly 
palpable triple orgasm, it'd be a Red 
Bull with wings. 

Afterwards, people exited the theater 
saying they had never felt so free. 
Maybe shouting "cunt" or listening to 
moans in public helped cause that sen-
sation, but something more had hap-
pened. Free. Feer. Fear. Freedom. That 
last word meant redemption. I was 
afraid, am still afraid, but at least I'm 
·-
aware of it now. When I enlisted as a 
Vagina Warrior, I had unwittingly 
embarked 
an 
epic 
journey. 
Somewhere between the statistics about 
-women at Yale, Cara's struggle for self-
respect and freeing myself from the 
expectations of womanhood, I learned 
to understand mysel£ My shooshoon 
was repressed; now it is alive. I'm not 
afraid to think about my vagina any-
more. It's like waking up from a drunk-
en stupor to the moment of clarity and 
the severe headache that escorts the 
reality of the morning after. 

The rest of the world, unfortunate-
ly, did not wake up with me. I till can-
not party alone at a frat or roll up my 
skirt, even though I like the feel of the 
breeze traveling up my legs. But I now 
know that I am afraid. I know this 
world is no utopia. Maybe President 
Bush would be pleased with my stance 
on rny right to self-defense. 

So to freedom I go~ This is one 
instance when ignorance is not bliss. 
I've let it all in into my shooshoon: 
my heart.
