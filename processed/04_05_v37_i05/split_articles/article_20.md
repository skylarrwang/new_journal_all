Preservation is an exact science, and

says, they asked themselves, "What do 
we take as a model from the museum 
world, and how do we adapt that for 
, ':; . 
library conservation?_" 
One such 
model is the conservation lab of the· 
BAC. 'The 
small, 
three-chamber 
department on the art museum's third 
floor abounds in equipment similar to 
• • 
that of the library's conservation lab. 
The BAG employs. Theresa Fairbanks 
Harris as chief · conservator and 
Heather Hendry as assistant conserva-
tor, both of whom specialize in treat-
ing works of art on paper, including 
prints, drawings, watercolors and pho-
tographs. Harris and Hendry handle 
these holdings, while Mark Aronson, 
chief conservator for YUAG, con-
serves the BAC's paintings part-tirne. 
Additional part-tirne contract conser-
vators tend to objects, painted minia-
tures and sculpture. 
While the book department learned 
from the example of the museum 
world, Harris acquired her skills as a 
Yale 
undergraduate working 
for 
Noack in the then-new book lab. 
Theresa has a warm, round face and 
salf-and-pepper hair tied back in a low 
ponytail accented with a big black 
bow. She is fascinated by the mechan-
ics of books, and points excitedly to 
several kinds of paper moulds whose 
weaves and .raised wire symbols pro-
duce different watermarks. The tex-
tures and watermarks these moulds 
yield, she explains, can be used to date 
and brand a piece of paper. 
Today, both Harris and Aronson 
teach Yale courses on art conserva-
tion. Harris's passion for pedagogy is 
evinced in the many labels stuck 
around her lab, which explain the pur-
pose of different paper-related a.rti.., 
facts. A paper conservator must know

detail .. A slightly threatening wasp's 
nest hangs above Harris's workspace 
'with a sign announcing, "PAPER 
WASP NEST INSPIRED SEARCH 
FOR · OTHER PAPER-MAKING 
FIBERS." Harris explains that wasp's 
nests made of chewed-up wood 
prompted people to seek out sources 
of paper stronger and more durable 
than rags. Ironically, 19th-century 
wood-pulp paper is weaker than 15th-
century rag paper, and, for this reason, 
it often demands more of a conserva-
tor's attention than older paper. 
Before 1777, Harris explains, paper 
did not . .-.' u~dergo chemical bleaching. 
Instead, .rags used for papermaking 
were bleached by sunlight to a soft-
white. Now, bleaching is . the most 
controversial practice of paper con-
servators, since over-emphasizing 
whiteness in paper tone violates the 
integrity of the object. For older 
works of art on paper, a crisp, clean 
look would deny the paper its tirue-
earned warmth of tonality and signs 
of age. 
She believes that both students and 
scholars can benefit from irmnersing 
themselves in her field. "Art historians 
shouldn't be writing about art if-they 
don't know how it's made," she says 
forcefully. Unlike the materials used 
for a literary work, the materials used 
for art are integral to scholarly inter-
pretation. While some literary scholars 
do draw on the knowledge of book 
conservators, such as students of 
material literary culture or the history 
of book ownership, art historians 
more frequently draw on the knowl-
edge of art conservators. And art con-
servators often pursue their own

the older paper. A conservator like her-
self, therefore, should take care not to 
remove the dirt on a Whistler print, 
because its· presence may be intentional. 
Because honoring the attist's intent 
is the essence of the art conservator's 
task, the hand of the conservator 
should be invisible. This intent often 
brings conservators into conflict with 
private art owners, who may be 
unaware of the original intent or situ-
ply prefer a cleaner look. ''People 
always want magical things out of 
conservators. . . [But] you don't want 
it to look magically conserved, you 
want it to look cared for," Harris care-
fully explains. 
. . scholarship as well. 
As an example, she offers two 
copies of the same··nurer print of 
Mary Magdalene. One appears lifeless 
and flat because a previous conserva-
tor was ignorant of or insensitive to 
the rightful texture of a print. The 
other copy of the print appears "like 
low-relief sculpture," elegantly tex-
tured and defined. 
Harris proudly 
describes how she locally bleached 
disfiguring stains and washed the print 
in water to remove the bleach and 
gently clean the paper. She then drew 
A conservator must also consider 
how an individual a r tist would have 
wanted his or her artwork to appear. 
Harris gives the example of Jarnes 
McNeil Whistler, who haunted old 
bookshops and bought blank mdsheets 
on which to print his etc ·

new corners with watercolors and

book conservators, all of Harris's 
efforts are reversible. 
Paper conservation tends not to be

factly. "Paper is not so sensational

because the treatments are often sub-
tle and the work is generally not hung 
up permanently on the wall because it 
will fade with exposure to light. In 
contrast, leaning paintings and sculp-
tures may dramatically alter their 
appearance, and this elicits controver-
sy. The paper conservation lab of· the

eveloped an interest in both 
science and art, pursued these inter-
ests at Winterthur, and has worked as 
a conservator at Yale for ten years. 
Or, as one might have said a centu-
ry ago, he works as a "resto.rer." The 
controversial nature of painting con-
servation comes out in the politically 
correct distinction between "conser-
vator" and "restorer": Before the 
field was professionalized in the late 
19th century, self-labeled "restorers" 
often tried to ·improve a painting's 
artistry or update it by painting 
directly over large swaths of a work 
rather than subtly and deliberately 
altering damaged bits. These restor-
ers gave the job a bad reputation, so 
now many professional restorers 
prefer the term "conservator.'·' In 
fact, a conservator does more than 
"restore" -that is, perform physical, 
hands 
on works to a painting. A 
conservator must deal with issues 
including heating, storage, travel 
conditions, light levels and humidity. 
Aronson shrugs from under his 
black cowboy hat. "Of course, I 
don't care 
restorer, conservator 
... at a party, suppose I'm asked what 
I do for a living? Glue." 
Naturally, Aronson does much 
30 
more than glue. At the moment he's 
putting 
together 
an 
exhibition 
explaining the controversy surround-
ing painting and conservation tech-
niques over the past three hundred 
years. The exhibition will focus on a 
specific painting by Benjamin West, 
created within what Aronson calls "a 
sphere of controversy and intrigue." 
Around 179 5, he explains, a manu-
script circulated through London 
detailing the technique of Italian 
masters such as Titian and Corregio. 
This pamphlet turned out to be a 
fake, but West took it seriously and 
followed its technical instructions. 
As one might imagine, the resulting 
. painting was a disaster and West was 
lampooned in the British press for 
his gullibility. A decade later, howev-
er, West painted the same scene 
again, this time with traditional 
methods, to wide acclaim. The 
YUAG owns the new version, while 
the poorly executed painting remains 
in private hands. Aronson's exhibi-
tion would bring the two versions of 
the scene together and demonstrate 
the visual effects of different paint-
ing techniques, how these techniques 
stand up over time and how conser- · 
vation can satisfy the maintenance 
demands of the respective methods. 
The painting conservation lab 
itself, temporarily relocated from its 
YUAG space due to construction, 
occupies a single large room where 
canvases from many periods sit 
propped on easels as if conversing 
with one another. Imposing metal
