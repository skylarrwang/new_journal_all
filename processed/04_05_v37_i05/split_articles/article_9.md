IN HIGH SCHOOL I COULDN'T HAVE THE 
French stud I dreamed of, but at least 
I was getting some action in French in 
Action, a famed language program cre-
ated by Yale Professor Pierre Capretz 
aimed at exposing students to French 
language and culture. Students are 
introduced to Robert, a bumbling 
American, and Mireille, a chic French 
art-history student, to follow their 
vaguely romantic adventures through 
France courtesy of workbooks, 
audio tapes and a whopping 26 hours 
of video. The program is based on the 
courses Capretz has been teaching at 
Yale since 1956--courses that pio-
neered a new system of language 
instruction. "I came to the United 
States in 1949 with the intent to spread 
French language and culture," he says. 
"I was appalled at the way languages in 
general were taught." More specifical-
ly, Capretz noted that French was 
taught without regard to French cul-
ture. "Culture is language, language is 
culture," he says. "So I tried to develop 
material with the real spoken language, 
and represent the real culture." 

The success of French in Action has 
caused it to spread beyond Yale class-
rooms. In 1987, Capretz, in conjunction 
with Annenberg/The Corporation for 
Public Broadcasting, consolidated his 
audio material and collection of over 
three thousand slides and embarked 
on a grueling three-month film shoot 
in Paris. The result was French in 
Action, a program that has been used 
extensively in secondary schools and 
universities around the United 
States, even in rural Alabama schools 
such as mine, a testament to the pro-
gram's pervasive success. But, 
Capretz's audience has not been limit-
ed to formal students; thanks to its 
backing by Annenberg/CPB, French in 
Action has aired on numerous public 
broadcast stations around the country 
and has been picked up by satellite in 
Australia and Brazil. Roger Ebert 
ranked it alongside the works of 
Shakespeare as one of the five things 
he would desire if he were marooned 
on a desert island; and according to 
Capretz, Annenberg/CPB once esti-
mated that eight million people had 
viewed French in Action in the United 
States alone. 

Now, 18 years after its video compo-
nent was filmed, French in Action has a 
decidedly vintage quality. "Since it was 
shot in '87, there are a number of 
things that are outdated," Capretz says, 
specifically citing the cultural aspects 
of the video that are now obsolete. 
Euros have replaced the francs with 
which Robert and Mireille purchased 
aperitifs at La Closerie des Lilas, and all 
of the characters are noticeably bereft 
of cell phones. "Everyone in France 
has a portable!" Capretz exclaims. In 
my high school French class, however, 
we were more amused by the charac-
ters' eighties get-ups: Robert strolls 
through Paris donning a white sports 
coat over his jeans and a baby-blue 
Yale tee-shirt, and many of Mireille's 
friends sport what can only be called 
the French equivalent of mall-hair. 

Capretz knows that it is time for French 
in Action to receive a major face-lift, 
and he is poised to unveil a new and 
improved version for the digital age: 
French in Interaction. 

Although filming has not begun, 
Capretz imagines a plot for French in 
Interaction that will teach students about 
modern French culture while still 
using footage from French in Action. 
Tragically, Robert and Mireille have 
not ended up together--perhaps I 
read too much into her invitation mid-
way through French in Action, for 
Robert to address her with the casual 
tu, rather than the formal vous. "The 
beginning will take place on Yale cam-
pus with the two original characters, 
Robert and Mireille," Capretz says. 
"They will be walking across Beinecke 
Plaza, when their paths cross and they 
recognize each other--they each now 
have a child at Yale. Then, they'll 
repair to some place, maybe Naples 
Pizza, and recall everything that hap-
pened twenty years ago." Thus, each 
episode of French in Interaction will 
begin with a new two-minute segment 
that updates the flashback from French 
in Action that follows. 

In addition to the updated video seg-
ments, French in Interaction will 
include--voila!--a number of com-
puter-aided interactive exercises. 
French in Action includes audio tapes 
that instructed students to repeat 
phrases uttered by both Capretz and 
the characters from the videos. 
"Now," says Capretz, "as [the student] 
answers, the response is recorded on 
the computer. Then it automatically 
plays back what the character said and 
what the student said." This allows 
students to compare their own 
responses to the originals. Students 
will also be able to watch the video 
portion of the program on the computer, 
with captions if they wish, which will 
allow them to form a stronger associa-
tion between the spoken and 
written word. 

On a practical level, French 
in Interaction will update 
Capretz's wildly successful 
teaching methods. And on a 
romantic one, perhaps it will 
finally allow Robert and 
Mireille to realize their sup-
pressed passion for one anoth-
er. After all, at the end of 
French in Action, he rescued her 
from a burning building. The 
two belong together.
