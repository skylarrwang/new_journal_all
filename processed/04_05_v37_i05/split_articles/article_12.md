'THE STORY OF 'IH E YAI E FOREST BEGINS 
indoors. Once inhabited by paleontolo-
gist and explorer Othniel C. Marsh, 
Marsh Hall is a charming old house 
which now accommodates the Yale 
Institute of Sustainable Forestry. 
"Institute," however, seerns a sterile 
word to describe this comfortable niche 
in academia untainted by titne or the 
upheavals of politics. Upon entering, I 
can't suppress the feeling that I've 
stepped into soniebody's home. The 
wooden spiral staircase squeaks amiably 
at every step. I atn here to see Mark 
Ashton, professor of Silviculture and 
director of the Yale school forests. In 
his office, a friendly clutter prevails: A 
mobile adorned with dried seed-pods 
hangs above the table, various rolls of 
paper are stuffed in containers with 
handwritten labels like "storage for 
maps in tubes," and an aquarium quiet-
ly grows algae. I meet with Ashton and 
two 
doctoral 
students 
Samantha 
Rothman, the Extension and Outreach 
coordinator, and Alexander Evans, the 
coordinator of Mapping and Inventory. 
Sam and Zander, both appropriately 
dressed in sage green and brown, cheer-
fully introduce themselves and begin 
telling me about the 10,880 acres of 
forest owned by Yale 
a plot of land 
that rnost undergraduates don't even 
know exists. 

There are a total of eight tracts of 
land in the Yale School Forest system. 
The land is not endowed and therefore 
must be self-sustaining, paying for itself 
through timber production. "You have 
to rnanage it sustainably," Sam says, 
"because-this is for the long haul." The 
largest tract 
and coincidentally, the 
largest physical possession of Yale 
University 
the Yale-Myers Forest is 
also the closest to campus, spanning 
the towns of Ashford, Eastford, Union 
and Woodstock, Connecticut. Myers' 
distance from big cities and its consid-
erable size tnake it a bona fide forest, a 
rare phenomenon in the dense urban 
landscape of the East Coast. In fact, it 
sits in an area called the "Last Green 
Valley," a surprisingly large chunk of 
Connecticut left undeveloped due to 
what Zander describes as "historical 
accident." 

Urbanization is a considerable obsta-
cle to the study of forestry on the East 
Coast. The Princeton School Forest, 
Sarn explains, is more like an urban
