shals New Haven teens to defend
their rights and the rights of others
thr<?ugh the innovative use of public
service announcements (PSAs). Laura
McCargar, the group's executive direc-
tor, along with program coordinators
Stephen Taylor and Hiram Rivera,
works year-round with New Haven
teenagers to turn their real-life experi-
ences into life-changing activism.
But the chang~s aren't only public.
Within the walls of Youth Rights
Media exists another support struc-
ture: one of supervision, safety and
respect. For kids abandoned by the
system, Youth Rights Media provides
a safeguard, a structure and a home.

Grand Avenue is a maze of
sparsely furnished rooms

. Guevara stand guard over the organi-
zation's office. "Hasta Ia victoria siem-
pre/' they proclaitn: "always until vic-
tory."

Against this backdrop of legendary
insurgents I first meet Laura. Always
rushing despite her high-heeled boots,
she greets me warmly but wastes no
tirne with pleasantries. Today is the
first day of the new Media Lab ses-
sion, she explains. Media Lab is one of
the many divisions of Youth Rights
Media, intended to introduce the teens
to video equipment and production
techniques. The teens involved with
the Lab will produce two

ond PSAs with messages of their
choice. When the 61 rns are finished,
there will be a ~creening 1:?-eld fqr fam-
ily and friends at a Media Showcase
event before the tapes 'are sent to ' ' . .
CTv, Connecticut's public access net-
work. Most of the kids I meet are here
for the first time. They've been
recruited from local high schools,
referred by juvenile care officers or
brought along by friends who partici-
pate in the program.

"We'll be getting started soon, so
make yourself at home, you know,
introduce yourself to everyone."
Laura's voice acquires a serious over-
tone as she examines me with cool
blue eyes. "The kids like to know
who's in the space."

She leaves the room and I'm stand-
ing helplessly, clinging to the table and
unsure of how to proceed. I smile hes-
itandy at two girls sitting at a table ..
They smile back and introduce them-
selves as sisters, Trenna and Ashley .

younger" sister Ashley is a newcomer.
We barely make it through introduc-
tions before Karl, another youth mod-
erator and YRM veteran, lopes by in
search of wayward teens. He pauses to
acknowledge Steve, the media coordi-
nator, staring bemusedly at a cluster of
three computer screens, all of which
feature different iterations of Karl's
face. "Karl's got his picture on every
computer in here!" Steve announces

Karl stnirks and ignores hin1, contin-
uing his search for unaccounted-for
teenagers. "Where are the happy
campers?"
he yells indignandy.
"Come on!"

Eventua11y the "happy campers" are
corralled into a large ,room where
most of the planning takes place. The
room's perirneter displays tituelines,
schedules, movie ideas and lists of
rules, but the focal point is a life-sized
oudine of a body tacked to the far
wall. The body is tattooed with hand-
written words, feelings, dos and ·
don'ts. Outside its lines are "drugs,"
"guns," "racism," and their coro11aries,
while inside are "friendship," "hon-
esty," "self-respect," and other posi-
tive adjectives. The boundaries of the
body are one line of defense against
the world's ugliness, and the density of
words on both sides shows how seri-
ous the battle is.

The only seating in the room con-
sists of twenty wheeled office chairs
which the kids use as bumper cars to
convert the space into a roller rink,
launching themselves like pinballs
around the room as Laura attempts to
introduce herself and the program.
Blessed with the ability to cornmand
order, Laura preet npts chaos by asking
the group what kinds of issues they
think a PSA should involve. Calls

"racial profiling." She treats them like
adults and challenges them to debates:
"Why is it natural for you to be told
that you fit the picture of a qjtninal?"
she asks pointedly. "Why is it natural
that altnost everyone in this room has
been locked up?"

RM began in 2002 during
Laura's senior year at Yale.
With two friends at Yale Law
School, she applied for a grant from
the Yale Entrepreneurial Society to
itnplement a youth advocacy project.
They won the grant, and before she
knew it, Laura had agreed to be the
organization's director.

She relates in detail the difficulties
of trying to convince people of
YRM's legiritnacy ("We had one roo~
and no phone, and no insurance. I
don't know how to get insurance!"), of

finding sqmeone to help with the
technical aspects of the group ("I
know nothing about media, it's rnirac-
ulous that Steve ever picked up the
phone"), of maneuvering the treach-
erous maze of red tape that chokes
even the most well-intentioned organ-
izations ("What do I know about writ-
ing contracts?
How do you run a
board meeting?"), and the ultixmate
gratification of doing what she loves,
which is working with the kids ("You
get your ass pummeled''). Even now
she seems deeply affected by her
experiences. "It was really lonely," she
reflects quietly. "You're learning so
much, so much. But you have to give
so much of yonrseJ-f away."

She stresses that complete openness
is vital to face the kinds of issues the
kids encounter on a daily basis. She
gives the exa111ple of an incident in a
train station where an older man

approached the group and asked her,
point blank, if she liked working with
little black children. The kids leapt to
her defense, she says, but that didn't
make the situation easier. "Doing this
kind of work, there's no way to avoid
those conversations. Part of the
responsibility of anyone who's white
and doing this work is to have these
conversations with the kids, to talk it
out." The sassy combination of
Laura's erudite vocabulary and street
smarts complement her core strength.
"Race has never been something that
I've felt apologetic about, because I
think to be apologetic is to feel guilty,
and then the work is to clear your per-
sonal guilt, and if the work is to clear
your personal guilt, you're not her~ for
the right reasons. Do I carry privilege
because of race, because of my Yale
education? Absolutely. But am I going
to
use
it
make
changes?
Absolutely."

And she has. YRM's most successful
project to date is a · 26-tninute docu-
mentary about
the
Connecticut
Juvenile Training School (CJTS).
Marketed as a juvenile rehabilitation
facility, the school resembled a prison
more than a center of learning.
Allegations of abuse and other · scan-
dals have plagued the school, and
YRM's documentary confirmed many
people's worst fears by exposing that
the school did not educate teens as it
promised, and that guards abused
teens without provocation. After visit-
ing the center, many of YRM's teens
were adamant that it be permanently
closed. With their mission decided,
they took their documentary on the
road. The film's statewide tour, along
with the activism of other advocacy
groups, has prompted Governor Jodi
Rell to appoint a task force to review
CJTS and to investigate the possibility
of its repetitive closure.

In addition to the short PSAs the
teens are currendy filming, YRM con-
tinue[ to work on longer docntnen-
tades ·about drug sentencing dispari-

ties and the harmful effects of unjus-
tified school suspensions on at-risk
youth. The organization actively
recruits new members and pushes
aggressively to get the teens' work
seen by policy-makers. Anonymous
teens have become activists whose
work has . a statewide impact. Each
new project emboldens them, and
makes the possibility of change more
immediate and real.
early half the teens enrolled
in the program have spent
rirne in the custody of the
Connecticut Department of Children
and Fami1ies, dealt extensively with
the court system or lived in group
homes. They joke about 'verbal and
phys~cal abuse tritely, tossing out tales
of near-death experiences as casually
as

last
night's
Knicks game.

The irony is that the abusive realities
of their lives are too severe for public
access. One afternoon when Hiram,
Sara, Marcus and I are writing lines for
a scene in which two parents verbally
abuse their daughter, Sara demands to
know why she can't use the word
"slut." "It's TV, you can't curse,"
replies Hiram, exasperated-he has
already reminded the kids of this lim-
itation several titnes.

Hiram is YRM's newest staff mem-
ber: focused, dedicated and an exam-
ple of ·what class clowns grow up to
be. But the grin that normally lights
his face has faded as he listens to the
teens float plot ideas that draw on
their own experiences with their par-
ents. Despite his practical admonition
that, "In real life, there are no happy
endings, and that's the message you
gotta put out there," Hirant winces
when Sara shrugs and defends her
word choice, "That's what my mom
said to me."

Later, Tim voices sitnilar frustrations
about
narrative
restrictions
imposed on his PSA. He stares benev-
olently into the camera, taking voice
of an uncanny Ward Cleaver. "No
dad's like, 'Hello son, how was your
day at school? Would you mind taking
out the trash?"' He grins and shakes
his head. "Naw man, they're like, 'If
you don't take that trash outside I'm
gonna whoop your ass so hard you
wish you'd never been born."' No one
disagrees, but rules are rules, and the
fuming of
PSAs proceeds
curse-free.

Which is why at 5:30 one afternoon,
only four sessions before the Media
Showcase, we fmd ourselves sitting in .
the lounge with a rotating crew of 12
teens, trying unsuccessfully to shoot
J
the first ten seconds of a PSA about
domestic abuse. The premise of the
intra is that the mother Jamie admon-
ishes the father Tim, to discipline their
teenage son Lyonel. Jamie, a feisty 15-
year-old who barely reaches five feet,
is impeccably dressed in a clingy,
sleeveless white shirt and tight blue
jeans. As the crew sets up the video
equipment she carefully positions her-
self in her chair, winks coyly at the
camera and, stniling flirtatiously,
launches Take one.

"Your son has not been goin' to
school," accuses Jarnie, beginning to
count on her fingers. "He's always
cotnin' around here with an his little
friends, and they be smokin', and
drinkin' and bringing drugs into the
house, and I will not have drugs in this
house, you understand me? And fur-
thermore your son is not listening to
me; he is being very disrespectful to
me, and you're gonna have to do
something about it because I will not
be treated that way in this house!"

She's still calling out crimes in a glee-
ful in1itation of her own mother when
Hiratn yells "Cut!" He's laughing too
