RECENTLY, A THIRD-GRADER. TOURING 
the Yale Peabody Museum pointed at a 
glass case and asked . a question about 
the third floor's largely-ignored 1983 
exhibit, "Habitants of Southern New 
England." He did not ask about the 
most popular item (the arrowheads), 
the flashiest (the beaded deerskin jack-
et), or even the most gruesome (a color 
photo of an Indian burial ground, pep-
pered with skeletons). 

"Is that a stuffed man?" he asked, 
pointing to the glass cube, inside of 
which a man with skin as weathered as 
the Marlboro cowboy's sat absolutely 
still, his jet-black hair obscuring eyes in 
a perpetual stare. It was a logical ques-
tion: The boy had just wandered 
through the museum's third floor, past 
the "Birds of Connecticut" exhibit 
where lime green cases showcase 
stuffed Dodos and hundreds of other 
taxidermied hunting prizes. In front of 
him sat another animal behind another 
sheet of glass above another small 
placard with another declaration of a 
species: . . . the first settlers. 

If the third-grader had looked closer, 
he might not have asked the question at 
all: The First Settler (TFS) has finger-
nails as smooth as soapstone, hair as 
shiny as videotape and a hairline crack 
running through his left knee revealing 
his flesh to be paper white. "Everything 
disintegrates with time, even a plaster 
cast," Maureen DaRos, the Peabody's 
anthropological museum assistant, says 
wistfully. "Well, maybe not the rocks." 

Posed in imitation of a flint carver, 
The First Settler grips a large stone as 
one might grip a saltshaker. In front of 
his immaculate loincloth; resting on a 
field of blue-gray paint is a dusting of 
flint shards. By his right knee, TFS has 
arranged his finished arrowheads as 
young boys might arrange their base-
ball cards. 

More than any other case in the 
museum, the glass of The First Settler 
is oily with fingerprints. While it seems 
somewhat normal to display stuffed 
grizzly bears and pinned beetles, there's 
something about a man trapped in a 
cube of glass that draws handprints. 
Security guards pacing around get used 
to him, but on their first few shifts they 
might mistake him for a fatigued 
tourist who has plopped down to rest. 
But he's not just resting; The First 
Settler is a Sisyphus working for eterni-
ty. In the online catalog, he's known 
simply as "YPM 13931" or "Showcase 
Cast of Indian." His locality is listed as 
"unknown," and no current curator--
not even the 91 year-old archaeologist 
who last worked the job --has any idea 
where he came from. 

As long as anyone can remember, 
The First Settler, like his namesake, has 
always been around. A darkened con-
tact sheet of old insurance photos 
shows him in his previous position, 
where the "Daily Life in Ancient 
Egypt" exhibit now steals the spotlight. 
A faded square on the black stone 
ground marks his former home. 

"There was just some burlap behind 
him when we moved him," Mrs. 
DaRos explains, "Nothing like the 
environment he's in now." 

In 1983, to honor the 50th anniver-
sary of the Archaeological Society of 
Connecticut which links the findings 
of amateur archaeologists with those 
of archaeological scholars, Peabody 
curators rearranged hundreds of 
objects which had been displayed in 
random order into a dimly-lit "educa-
tional" exhibit. The exhibit chronolog-
ically traces each historical period with 
puny pen-and-ink sketches depicting 
the use of each tool. The purpose of 
the exhibit, like the purpose of archae-
ology, is to understand how people 
lived. The First Settler is a "living" 
example of this educational mission; a 
man arranged with the tools of his 
time, posed as his creators imagine he 
might have once posed. "Sometimes 
people think, 'Oh, the exhibit's so bor-
ing,"' DaRos says, scanning the arrow-
heads and soapstone bowls, "But then 
they turn around and the diorama is 
right over there." 

The exhibit is visited by third-graders, 
collectors who wish to compare the 
history of an arrowhead they've dug up 
to one displayed and Native American 
tribes. The tribes come to examine the 
remains in the museum's collection 
after they are notified in accordance 
with the Native American Grave 
Protection and Reappropriation Act, 
which gives them the right to claim 
what is theirs. Just this past March, a 
Sioux descendant and archaeological 
scholar accused the Peabody of steal-
ing from the tribe in the 1870s. Based 
on his research, the museum returned 
the fossils taken from Sioux land--
they always give back to "recognized 
tribes," but there are "fakers." So far, 
no one has claimed The First Settler. 

In 1911, a San Francisco museum 
made a plaster cast of the last living 
member of a tribe, and even kept his 
brain in a jar for posterity. While it's 
more likely The First Settler was a cast 
of a regular artist's model, it remains 
unclear where he came from. If you 
ignore the hairline crack and pretend 
he's really the man the exhibit says he 
is, you'll learn from an informational 
placard that "Native Americans arrived 
in what is now Connecticut around 
10,900 B.C., by which time the last ice 
sheet had retreated northward from 
the state." Though they would have 
liked to have gone further south, "The 
first settlers ... were prevented from 
proceeding south by the final ice sheet, 
which extended across Canada." 

Twelve thousand and five years later 
there's another ice sheet: a plate of 
glass between a plaster man and the 
curious hands that slide across 
the pane.
