foster more competition within Yale's 
campus. Warning:· A\l YCoutute 
designers . come equipped with scis-
sors and needles .. But Orly Friedman, 
the vice-president of production, 
takes a different view: "I think it real-
ly works better if everyone has their 
own project, and uses the group as 
support." Le acknowledges the diffi-
culty in coordinating group projects. 
Sometimes the bias each designer has 
for his or her own collection is more 
severe than the cut of the dresses 
coursing down the runway. 
Plus, 
designers are .reluctant to let other 
individuals intervene with their work 
• 
in any capacity, fearing that their 
vision· n11ght be compromised. "It's 
very hard for you as an artist to let 
someone else take care of the art-
work," Le continues. 
Jon Fougner, the 
student-producer 
for 
YCouture, suggests two 
ways for members to 
avoid 
competition. 
First, the group must 
offer "incentive struc-
tures" to prevent inter-
nal contests. 
The 
conunuruty. servtce 
projects· and special 
events 
-
that 
YCouture plans to 
orgaruze next year 
will hopefully diffuse 
such competition. 
A 
Project Runway-esque 
event tops the list of 
potential activities. 
It 
will be open to anyone 
interested, regardless of 
previous fashion expert-
ise. YCouture will select a 
specific material 
such as foil or a 
trash bag that all participants must 
then transform into a fashionable 
item. Le envisions famous designers 
and 
Yale 
aluruni 
judging 
the 
final products. 
Additional projects would likely 
include a lecture series and designing 
April2005 
sessions. 
In terms of conununity 
service, Le hopes that YCouture Will 
continue to contribute to important 
causes. She has also proposed a pro-
gram in which YCouture members 
would help battered women living in 
shelters improve their presentation 
for job interviews. 
In the meantime, YCouture will 
continue to struggle to find its fit. 
But this will become even more diffi-
cult after Le steps down from her 
presidential post at the year's end. 
Finding an appropriate' replacement 
should be one of the organization's 
top priorities. According to Fougtler, 
groups "sink or swim based on how 
they pick the next year's leadership." 
YCouture is no exception. Le's pred-
ecessor must be willing to introduce 
new incentives to lure more Y alies 
into the fashion rea1rn. It is a job that 
requires the threading together of 
business, couture and a vivid itnagina-
tion and proves, like Le believes, 
. "Creativity goes a very long way .... " 
Hopefully next year's fashionable 
pants will avoid design disaster. After 
all, fashion should be simple.
