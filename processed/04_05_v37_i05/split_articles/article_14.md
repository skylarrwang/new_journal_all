n October 20, the two surviving owners of Horowitz Bros., Arthur 
and Leonard Horowitz, abandoned Chapel Street to its future. 
Where an ocean of buttons and waves of fabric once flooded 
every corner, long-time employees waited out the store's final hour 
among boxes strewn like driftwood on an empty seabed. In the past few 
decades as other Chapel Street stores fled the city, Horowitz Bros. stayed on, a 
community landmark. But now even they were closing shop. One woman 
walked out of the double doors and onto the street with tears streaming down 
her face. Her name was Maria Acampora and for thirty years, she had been the 
Horowitz's bookkeeper. 

That day Suzanna Lengyel wandered through the store, taking it all in. An 
occasional customer throughout the decades, she had shopped h~re only when 
her husband's suit jackets needed new elbow patches. For the past nine months, 
however, with uttnost dedication, she had collected a library of documents,-
some mourning the store's demise, others praising its legacy. 
She asked a 
saleslady where she might find the owners and followed the woman's finger to 
the figure of Art Horowitz. Worried he rnight be gruff and nervous about what 
she had come to tell him, Suzanna introduced herself 
Art seemed happy to meet her (a friend of his cousin Phil, she said) and he 
listened as she told him about what Phil's wife Hilda had begun ca11ing 
Suzanna's "obsession." Suzanna could not believe that as an older version of 
ew Haven disappeared behind the fa<_;:ades of luxury apat tments and interna-
tional chains, the city had made no gesture to recognize the cornmiunent of the 
Horowitz tradition. B..ut if the bureaucrats at Gty Hall had not remembered the 
Horowitz brothers, Suzanna's dossier proved that plenty of 
ew Haven resi-
dents did. Now she wanted to channel these collective memories into a physi-
cal sign of the city's esteem. Her plan: to renarne the 
intersection of Chapel and State streets, 
where the store had stood for 
so long, Horowitz Bros.

of a brighter future that never seems

tory is not without its successes. 
Street signs like the one Suzanna 
envisions memorialize those who 
have given New Haven hope. Bishop 
Tutu Corner, Elsie Cofield Way, 
Steven J. Papa Corner and other signs 
prove that an individual can impact a 
city, even one as obstinate as 
New Haven. 
he history of these signs

at the corner of 
College and Chapel, the city's 
heart. Here, New Haven thrives. 
Yale's faux-Gothic buildings share 
sidewalks with the brand name stores 
that feed off the University's eco-
nomic power. The New Haven

in New Haven, but around the world,

1980s, Joel Schiavone, then a recent 
Yale graduate, began his career as a 
developer with a vision of an 
improved Chapel Street. Remaking, 
remodeling 
and 
revitalizing, 
Schiavone turned the neighborhood 
into a capitalist haven; he was "lauded 
as New Haven's savior. · · 
While Schiavone was scrubbing the 
dirt off New Haven's face, he neg-
lected to keep his own hands· clean. 
In 1987, when the anti-apartheid 
struggle in South Africa garnered 
world-wide support and the Ut).ited 
States imposed sanctions on that 
country, Schiavone flagrantly ignored 
world's 
condemnation 
attended the Young Presidents' 
not his only contributions to leave a 
mark. The New Haven tycoon inad-
vertently jump-started a city-wide 
street-naming trend.

f most residents of New Haven 
do not remember the corner's 
story, they certainly recognize

. "Have you heard of Bishop Tutu 
Corner?" Romy Drucker, a Yale 
College 
sophomore, 
asked 
leather-skinned store owner of the 
Artistic Beauty Salon. He nodded, 
although his yellowed eyes rema1ned 
blank. "We want to have something 
like that for the Horowitz brothers, 
in order to recognize all the years 
they were here." 

"Yeah, sure," says the store owner. 
"Mike 
" he calls across the room, 
"Sign this for them, okay?" Mike 
wore a stained white undershirt and a 
mustache. The somnolence of these 
two men contrasted strangely with 
their surroundings. Even Romy's 
feathery pink scarf, normally the 
brightest color for block~ paled in 
comparison with the cloying colors 
of the salon. 

On a wet and drizzly Friday morn-
ing in December, Romy and Suzanna 
petitioned the shops on Chapel Street 
for support of the Horowitz Bros. 
street sign. Romy did the ta11cing, 
while Suzanna added supportive 
comrnents. The morning had been 
fa1rly successful, but, after the beauty 
salon, Romy looked as if she was not 
entirely sure why, in the middle of 
exams, she was spending a morning 
in downtown New Haven talking 
about street signs. 

She and Suzanna had met after an 
article she published about the clos-
ing of Horowitz Bros., "Endstitch,"

The 
trend spread from Wooster Street 
into the African-American cornrnuni-
ty, where reverends and bishops of 
various churches were honored for 
selfless dedication to their parishes. 
By 2003, it seemed the Board was 
voting to erect another slgn for a dif-
ferent segment of the city's popula-
tion every few months. During the 
height of the craze, a mosque peri-
tioned for a "Nasi Moharnmed" cor-
ner, a project that was derailed only 
when the city realized that the person 
in question was not a local figure but 
the prophet Mohammed. 

As signs cropped up in all corners 
of the city, tension mounted. Some 
claitmed the Board was weighing 
down every inch of New Haven with 
meaningless monuments. In 2003, 
The New Haven Register asked readers 
to "sound off' on the question, "Is 
the naming of street corners for indi-
viduals overdone?" A related article 
argued that aldermen used the signs 
to curry favor with their constituen-
cies by drawing "laundry lists of 
names, some of them arguably ques-
tionable." Citizens reacted with indig-
nation: The signs were an honor, not 
an empty political gesture. One 
woman marched indignantly into the 
mayor's office and demanded that 
even more signs bear the narnes of 
locals, arguing that streets named
