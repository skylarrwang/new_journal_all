crazy. Ideally, pants should graze the 
ground, so as not to reveal too much 
shoe, she says. While Le's preference 
might seem perfectly ridiculous, as the 
president of YCouture she has always 
had her own sense of what's haute and 
what's not. "My philosophy is very sim-
ple, my fashion is for purely artistic rea-
sons ... " Le explains, "Simplification is 
my thing." 

To see her vision realized, Le created 
YCouture, an organization for student 
clothing designers. The group, which 
focuses on collaborative efforts 
between designers and the promotion 
of individual collections, extends 
beyond Le's vision of fashion as art: It 
proves fashion means business. 

It encourages a free exchange of ideas 
amongst its designers, producers and 
models, and lets Yalies use the language 
of textile, stitches, cut and color to 
communicate. YCouture's mission is 
two-fold (or pleated). It caters to the 
Yale population by cultivating a fash-
ion-conscious environment on campus 
and to the extended New Haven com-
munity by engaging in service projects. 

But the seams of the organiza-
tion are not as clean as Le would 
have hoped. She and the rest of 
the board have struggled to deter-
mine precisely how the group 
should operate. Since its debut on 
January 23, 2005, YCouture's 
biggest jaunt was staging the 
finale for the inaugural Winter 
Arts Festival. This initial 
attempt to rally the Yale com-
munity around fashion proved 
highly successful and highly 
lucrative. The group sold more than 
one hundred tickets, and all of the 
show's proceeds went to tsunami 
relief. 

This charitable donation 
demonstrated YCouture's position as 
a multi-faceted organization--equally 
dedicated to community service and 
fashion awareness. However, since the 
organization supports multiple design-
ers--all of whom assign individual 
meaning to their work--Le emphasizes 
the challenge YCouture has faced in 
choosing one message that serves to 
positively represent the group without 
disregarding the personalities that com-
prise it. Because YCouture acts as an 
umbrella organization for Yale's fashion 
community, it needs to split its effort 
between coordinating group 
shows--like the one which 
closed the Winter Arts 
Festival--and assisting 
individual design collec-
tions. When YCouture 
came into fruition late 
last year, many design-
ers interested in the 
group already had their 
own show ideas under-
way. But, the priority of 
YCouture's debut collec-
tion meant that many per-
sonal projects were put on 
hold. 

This caused such a 
reaction among the group's 
members that for the 
remainder of the year, the 
organization will only sup-
port individual collections 
and not attempt any 
large projects. 

Even though YCouture is less than a 
year old, the group is already looking to 
revamp its repertoire. There are two 
possible futures for YCouture: to pro-
duce and design shows which feature 
the collections of many designers or 
assist separate projects. Aiming for 
both could confuse the organization's 
image and result in overextended 
resources. 

Le wants to prevent 
YCouture from mimicking fashion's 
cut-throat nature. Even within the Yale 
bubble, she worries that attitudes more 
suited to Madison Avenue than to Elm 
Street might emerge: "I'm afraid self-
interest might take and it will fall apart." 
In what is already an aggressive aca-
demic environment, Le has no desire to
