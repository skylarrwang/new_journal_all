In the end, there is an hour -• .-
of footage and one usable 
minute. 

It will 
take 
a 
Herculean feat of editing to 
make the PSA suitable for 
television, but the final prod-
uct is stunning in its simplicity. On the 
night of the Media Showcase, a room-
ful of parents and friends falls silent 
as Jamie lists her son's offenses and 
Tim threatens to teach hirn a lesson 
"like my father taught me." _ While -
waiting for his son to arrive home, 
Tim flashes back to his own child-
hood memories of abuse, and when 
Lyonel walks in, he chooses not to hit 
him. "Don't make the same choices 
your parents made," cautions the 
voiceover. "Break the chain of abuse." 

When the lights buzz back on, Sara 
rises to read her speech. Her voice 
rings clearly through a silent room. 
"This topic is important to me 
because I think that many of our 
youth are dea1ing with matters just like 
this. I was also verbally abused 
throughout my life. I an1 now 16 
years-old, and the abuse in my fami1y 
got to the point that I had to be taken 
out of the house. 

"I know that I made a lot of bad 
decisions that reflected on the abuse I 
got at home. Maybe if my parents did-
April2005 
n't make me feel like I had nothing to 
live for then maybe my self-esteem 
wouldn't be so low. I also learned not 
to get attached to people because I 
feel that they will verbally abuse me, 
or worse. But I can't keep speaking on 
my past. Now that I look at this audi-
ence of people I wish that my mother 
who abused me to the point where she 
tried to kill me could be here. That's 
why I want to help youth, so they 
won't 
go 
through 
what 
I 
went through." 

Thunderous applause ruptures the 
stunned silence as a grinning Sara 
walks back to her seat. It's Marcus' 
turn now. He walks to the podium, his 
clothes hanging on his lanky frame. 
"I didn't write anything," he says hur-
riedly. "This is from the heart. Coming 
here was, like, a big step for me, and 
you know, I look up to everybody." He 
pauses and studies the podium. 
"That's all I got to say." 

After the Showcase several teens 
hover around Laura, asking about the 
next project and promising faithful 
attendance. In the weeks to follow, 
their faces will not disappear, but 
become fixtures of 924 Grand 
Avenue as they turn to bigger projects: 
taking on the New Haven police 
deparunent in a student-led teach-in 
and 
the Connecticut House of 
Representatives in an effort to change 
unfair drug laws. Their oasis draws 
them in even when they are not sched-
uled; they will bring their friends and 
their friends' friends; they will ask 
Laura for help with homework and 
college applications and probation 
officers. The work will be hard: The 
world outside of the body will pene-
trate uninvited. But right now, uni-
formed in black, white and red Youth 
Rights Media tee-shirts, the teens 
resetnble the posters of Che Guevara 
that preside over the strictly business 
rootn: a gueri11a band of revolutionar-
ies. The only difference is, they are just 
getl iog started.

the windows pays tribute to the art and 
Memorial Library (SNiL). Just 
its academic patton. 

Beginning in the early 1900s, Yale . 
received several large donations that 
inspired a proliferation of campus-wide 
building 
projects. 
In 
1911, 
the 
University appointed a conunittee to 
oversee construction alongside architect 
James Gamble Rogers, who designed 
SML as well as several other Yale build-
ings. Rpgers and the committee agreed . 
that the new buildings should con-
tribute to the. Collegiate Gothic style of 
the ~am pus. ·.· Thm.tgh modeled after 
Oxford and Cambridge, Collegiate 
Gothic was 
considered · a 
stricdy 
American style that it~~itated medieval 
cathedrals 
strongholds of the educat-
ed during the Middle Ages-but echoed 
more contemporary Bauhaus, Art Deco 
and Modern architec~al styles. 

The Gothic style offered the ornate 
decoration and monumental stature that 
American colleges wanted their edifices· 
to possess. The "unity in diversity" 
mantra of Gothic architecture influ-
enced Rogers, who encouraged the 
artists and craftsmen he hired to express 
individuality and creativity in their work. 
The window handles, engravings, gar-
goyles and painted windows reflect the 
myriad moods of these at tists. Had 
another team of craftsmen ornamented 
Sterling, it would have been no less char-
acteristic of the Collegiate Gothic style, 
but no single engraving or window 
would have looked the same. The win-
dow.s are a memory of a moment lost in 
-orne. 

Rogers hired G. Owen Bonawit to 
design the windows of SML. During 
the 1920s and '30s, Bonawit was a 
skilled and well-known window painter. 
Like all of the craftsmen hired to 
embellish Rogers' brainchild, Bonawit . 
enjoyed a fajr amount <;>f artistic license. 
Occasi'ona1ly the Yale. conimihee pro-
posed specific images and plates to be 
replicated ·· in window form, but the 
University mainly offered only written 
suggestions. Bonawit' s creative freedom 
was virtually unfettered. 

Although Bonawit looked to the win-
dows of medieval cathedrals for inspira-
tion, the windows of a library serve a 
distinctly different function than the 
stained glass of a church. In a church, 
the windows hover above naves and 
apses, leu ing in just enough light to 
glimpse the other end of the church. 
More importantly, the light is elevated 
and reverential. In a ID>rary, however, 
there must be sufficient light to pern tit 
reading. S'mce this light should be at eye 
level, every turn and sn1udge of the 
brush channels the light toward a read-
er's nose. Structurally, the coarse lead 
cames that hold the glass in place don't

it is officially titled according F<? the Yale 
University Library Gazette, an ·~chive of 
the library's images, "Ne~9 i: dtring a

When the . lil:i.fary was 
renovated in 1995 and the Windows 
were carefully removed to be .,.cleaned, 
Little Sambo was freed frorr;_ his glass 
and lead shackles because he was 
deemed offensive. Instead, . a happy 
book took his place near the smiling 
cook, the Queen of Hearts scarfing 
down her tarts and the other gourmand 
window paintings that line•, the SML 
staff lunch room. 

Yale's decision to remove the Sambo 
window suggests that the University 
believes people actually recog••jze the 
deliberate placement of window paint-
'· 
ings in the library. But most Y alies are 
conditioned to the catnpus' Collegiate 
Gothic style: The library is not regarded 
·as an art gallery. While library employ-
ees may notice the window paintings 
that dominate their office space, stu-
dents seldom trek up to the reading 
rooms and offices in the stacks. SML 
has 3,300 windows which took months 
to design, paint and install. Taking the
