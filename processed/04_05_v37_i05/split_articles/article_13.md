park than a forest, due to its close 
proximity to campus. 
Constant use 
disturbs the forests' utility as an envi-
ronment for controlled scientific study. 
While the Yale-Myers Forest largely 
escapes the problematic side-effects of 
urbanization, Tourney Forest, another 
of the eight which hugs the city of 
Keene, New Hampshire, is not so 
lucky. Visitors frequently leave trash 
behind, which the institute must send 
teams to clean up. 
"That's the unfortunate aspect," 
exp1ains Ashton. "We find things· like 
couches stuffed with tofu." 
"literally," darifies Zander after 
a pause. 

Myers operates with three goals in 
tnind: research, education and man-
agement. The land serves as a hands-
on laboratory where students and pro-
fessors can conduct controlled proj-
ects in order to study forest manage-
tnent techniques. Most of the land i~ 
closed 
to 
the public. 
"We have a lot of 
expenments out m 
the woods," Zander 
explains, "So we can't 
have a lot of people 
trampmg 
every 
which way." 

But there are ways 
for the public to 
experience the forest. 
A 
long trail that 
crosses some of the 
most beautiful parts 
of the Myers Forest 
is popular among the 
hiking 
community 
and a destination of 
some Yale FOOT 
trips. Students can 
conduct research as 
faculty assistants or 
take 
silviculture 
classes, which tradi-
tionally 
involves 
spending 
a 
few 
nights there in the 
spring. The institute also hosts events 
such as the Christtnas Tree Cut, during 
which anyone can join the Society of 
American Foresters members in har-
vesting pine trees and transporl ing 
them back to the Marsh Hall lawn, 
where they are sold each year. 

Another annual conununity event is 
the "Bio-Blitz" 
an ali-day and night 
wilderness excursion in which partici-
pants attempt to count how many dif-
ferent species they can identify in 24 
hours. Usually people give up at night-
fall, but Zander lights up when he 
remembers, "We have a bat person this 
year!" 

As for School of Forestry students, 
they embark on a week-long forest 
adventure at the be · 
· g of their 
masters' study, a rite of passage that 
every hopeful forester must brave. 
During this rirne they trarnp around in 
the woods, sleep in tiny bunks, get 
eaten alive by mosquitoes and experi-
ence hands-on what forestry is all 
about. 
Forestry is dirty, trying and 
character building. 

The thing that strikes me most about 
the three foresters is their apparent 
obsession with the forest. Sam gushes 
about her summers spent doing field 
work there, showing me a photograph 
of the sutnrner crew engaged in an 
intense game of wiffle-ball. When I 
ask how much rirne they usually spend 
in the forest, Zander replies that he is 
there at least one day a week during the 
year and two to three days a week dur-
ing the surmner. 
Mark just built a 
house there. 

Sam smns it up for me: "When I 
went to Yale-Myers I knew this is 
where I wanted to be." 

As Zander declares, "It's a labor 
of love."

**Unlikely Plot**
**Author: Anna Altman**

I PASS UNDER 'IH E G.A:IE OF THE GROVE 
Street Cemetery and separate from 
the crowd of students quickly pass-
ing by. The epigraph on the portal-
"The Dead Shall Be Raised" 
may 
be a source of comfort to those who 
come here, but the words retnind me 
that a cemetery serves as a final des-
tination, an ending, not a fertile 
ground on which to build a life. 

Knocking on the frosted glass door 
of the cemetery's brownstone office, 
I wonder what it must be like for 
William Cameron, the cemetery 
superintendent, to walk through 
these gates on a daily basis.-

When he opens the door, 
Cameron's disposition inunediately 
confirms my assumption that he 
must be thickskinned: He brusquely 
offers me a wooden chair just beside 
the door, situated at least five feet 
away from where he sits behind his 
desk, and asks me coldly what I want. 
"What don't I do," he scoffs, describ-
ing his profession. "It would take me 
a week, two weeks to tell you." 

Cameron ft.rst came to Grove Street 
in 
order 
"work 
outdoors." 
However, a graveyard seems an 
unlikely destination for someone 
simply seeking fresh air, and his 
clipped answers don't sufficiently 
explain why he has stayed for thirty 
years. But Cameron's surroundings 
suggest that he is more suited for 
cadavers than cubicles. His office is 
the only sign of life 
it brims with 
large plants and the continued yelps 
of three small dogs. There are no fil-
ing cabinets to be found. 

But the pets and plants in 
Cameron's office provide only the 
smallest ._ indication of his unusual 
r 
profession. Just feet away from 
-
' 
Cameron hovers his wife, Joan 
Cameron, who works as the ceme-
tery's assistant superintendent. The 
Camerons have been married for 
more than fifty years and have 
worked together for his entire tenure 
as superintendent. "We're a team," he 
tells me as he slouches back in ·his 
chair, fingers interlaced over his 
trtm torso. 

Cameron's "team" includes his four 
children and two grandchildren. 
While most people consider death an 
unexpected tragedy, the experience of 
working in a cemetery has caused 
. Cameron's family to deal with death's 
logistical details with overly rational 
precision. Growing up in an environ-
ment consistently plagued by loss has 
an effect on the children, who, he 
tells me, are now more "willing to 
accept the reality of death." 

I find myself squeamish and fidg-
ety when we talk about cremations, 
burialso, and tombstones. Death is 
not something everyone can stom-
ach; it is an acquired taste. Most peo-
ple, according to Cameron, try to 
ignore the inevitability of death, and 
fami1ies are often left unprepared 
when death does in fact occur. 

"There can be a lot of confusion for 
the family," he says with the authori-
ty of a man who has buried more 
than 7 50 corpses. 

For each burial, he becomes an 
integral part of that family's grieving 
process. "Everyone grieves in a dif-
ferent way," he tells me, recalling a 
Russian woman who visited her hus-
band's grave every day for years 
before Cameron finally buried her 
alongside hirn. Before she died, the 
woman often sought Cameron's 
company. His wife boasts about how 
good her husband is at his job; and 
how strongly he affects the bereaved. 
"People really cling to Bill for com-
fort," she muses as she plays with the 
dog curled in her lap. 

Though Cameron insists that "not 
too many people make an impres-
sion," on hirn, he acknowledges that 
helping people through a difficult 
tirne is a significant part of his work. 
"You get close to people," he admits. 
But when his job requires hirn to 
bury someone he knows, it-becomes 
different 
situation: 
"It does 
bother you." 

In a sense, Cameron and his wife 
are earthly angels. "We get along so 
good with people, I can't believe it," 
he says. Perhaps Cameron carne to 
the cemetery to work outdoors, but 
helping people has become a signifi-
cant part of why he now lives for 
the job. 

Catneron eventually divulges that 
he's writing a book about his work. It 
was his own idea, he explains, and he 
hasn't thought about selling it yet. 
"It's hard to get into," he admits (he 
can only write for "two, maybe three 
hours at a tirne") but he already has a 
title: Life in a Cemetery. As he goes on 
past the title to recite the opening 
line, I atn reminded that a cernetery is 
not just a graveyard. It is a tirne cap-
sule for people and memories. "Yes, 
there is life in a cemetery," Cameron 
reads, "and I've lived that life for 25 
years."
