bag people? I can't even tell." A line 
between acting and real life had been 
blurred. Then bag people started 
changing into their Renaissance 
costumes in front of the audience. 
When they went on to juggle and 
clown, dance, and play music, and 
walked through 
the audience 
introducing themselves, the audience 
understood that they were actors in a 
pre-show pageant that opened Taming 
of the Shrew. 

Joey Tomorrow, an independant 
artist in New Haven who directed the 
pre-show, intended it to help the 
audience make the transition from 
contemporary New Haven to Shakes-
peare's world, in what he refers to as a 
"sandwiching of time." With the set 
comprised 
of simple scaffolding, 
striped curtains, and painted tap-
estries, the Green didn't need to be 
disguised: because the audience knew 
that people were playacting, they could 
enjoy it and laugh with the actors-
even with the ambulance sirens in the 
background. Like commedia players, 
Performance Studio brought theater to 
the Green, if not exactly to the street. 
Some might say that the poetry is 
lost in such popular versions of 
Shakespeare; but then for Seham, if a 
play does not keep the audience's 
interest, the ideas will be lost. "There's 
an assumption that I'm less intel-
lectual," she said with sarcasm. "I 
actually have a lot of themes in my 
work: disguise, deception, identity. 
But people say, 'We'll do Art and be 
intellectual over here, but not be 
entertaining."' In bringing out 
elements that are of broad appeal, 
making the action and humor of 
Taming of the Shrew as clear as possible, 
Seham's work 
perhaps 
succeeded 
where the fully professional theater 
companies fail. "I'll be sitting there (in 
other theaters) totally bored, watching 
Shakespeare. I don't understand how 
that can happen. But it's amazing how 
many productions I've seen where 
they've had the iambic rhyme, or the 
British accents, but the audience did 
not understand what was going on." 
Without theater walls, Shakespeare 
on the Green has opened up theater to
New Haven not only by making it 
understandable for anybody, but also 
by making it free. Anyone can go. "It's 
a 
very egalitarian function," as 
producer Kevin Sheehan described it. 
"Shakespeare wrote for all audiences, 
but he ends up in stuffy theaters with 
rich people chortling." Open theater is 
not only an ideal for Seham, but a 
working habit. At a rehearsal where 
two kids on bikes were mimicking 
Seham as she gave direction to actors, 
someone asked "Should they be there?" 
She responded abruptly, "They are our 
audience." Beneath her common-sense 
approach to classic drama and the 
matter-of-fact way she discusses it, 
Seham holds a deep conviction that 
theater must be accessible to everyone. 
She believes a major problem with 
theater at Yale that the Performance 
Studio avoids is an exclusiveness that 
shuts people out: "That pretentious 
quality, that elite quality in theater is 
anti-theater." The vision behind the 
Performance Studio and its Shake-
speare on the Green productions 
centers on undermining the elitism of 
theater- the elitism of Art that sits 
aloft without making itself understood, 
but also the basic social elitism of 
theater that can charge $30 a show. 
"Theater is for the people. We've 
gotten into this thing, that you can 
only go see a play if you're a yuppie." 
Seham throws her hands up. "No! 
Theater is part of your life. You don't 
have to be exclusive about it, you must 
be inclusive." 

In the groups that passed by the 
rehearsal, or in the large audiences 
that brought lawn chairs, blankets, and 
picnic dinners to the Green, you could 
see that people who might never 
experience a Shakespeare play, or any 
theater at all, have a chance to see it. 
At one rehearsal, a woman with her 
baby daughter and her mother stopped 
to watch, finally sitting beside the stage 
for the next hour and a half. Now and 
again she would say "Jesus!" and shake 
her head, laughing. As Kate slapped 
her sister Bianca in the face, an "oh my 
God" came from a group of teenagers 
on the other side of the stage. Their 
tone was highly sarcastic, but they 
clapped when they left . . . forty 
minutes later. "I don't mean to be 
patronizing," Seham added, "but a lot 
of the people on the Green aren't 
college grads, and if they can get the 
jokes and laugh, I did something right. 
I didn't undo what Shakespeare put 
into his play." 

Making Shakespeare free to New 
Haven has of course required someone 
to pay the bills, if not the actors. This 
year, sponsors such as First Federal 
Savings, CBT, SNET, as well as the 
Connecticut Arts Council and other 
sources contributed $30,000- still 
short of paying the actors. That 
Shakespeare on the Green started out 
in its first two seasons with budgets of 
$5,000 and $15,000 respectively, that 
the T.V. station WNTH has given the 
production free publicity, and that a 
variety of private concerns and state 
agencies have volunteered their help 
indicates that the city in general is 
becoming enthusiastic about the 
benefits of the annual production. For

the commercial sponsors, Shakespeare 
on the Green lets them give something 
back to customers, something more 
creative than bonus teddy bears or 
alarm clocks. The main benefit is of 
course to the cultural life of New 
Haven as a whole; Performance Studio 
would like everyone to see that, along 
with the Brian Alden Jazz Festival, 
they're trying to make New Haven, as 
Sheehan describes it, "an exciting place 
to be on summer weekend nights." 

For the Performance Studio, the act 
of creation is messy; not a business, 
but fun. When the actors could not go 
out on the Green opening night, 
Sehain held a rehearsal in which no 
one could speak their dialogue; it 
resulted in hilarious slapstick and 
horseplay that conveyed Shakespeare's 
story without words. This kind of 
theater cares more about the process of 
theater than the end product. The 
Performance Studio not only opens up 
Shakespeare to new audiences, but it 
makes the creativity of theater 
accessible to people who might not 
have the chance of doing it quite the 
same way elsewhere. In New Haven, 
with Shakespeare on the Green, actors 
have found a place and a way of doing 
theater that is different, fulfilling, and 
rewarding.
