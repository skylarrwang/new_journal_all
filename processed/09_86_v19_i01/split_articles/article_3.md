New Home for Hot Items 
Just about everyone except Freshmen 
will be surprised this fall when they 
walk into Wawa's. The store, a haven 
of relief for weary weenies shuffiing in, 
reaching for their favorite shelves by 
reflex, 
has undergone a 
minor 
overhaul. It may look the same to the 
exhausted pre-med stumbling in at 3 
a.m. with her eyes half-closed, but 
when she goes for the two liter diet 
Coke she may find herself with the 
king-size Clorox instead. And for the 
English major, desperate for enough 
coffee to last him through a night while 
he churns out three more papers, the 
mini Maxwell House jars are now next 
to the Dristan in the O.T.C. drug 
section behind the counter. 
"At first customers got frantic," said 
Linda Ostrom who is Wawa's relief 
manager. 'You changed the store! 
How dare you!' they said. We're such 
creatures of habit that even we [the 
people who work at Wawa's] would go 
for something on a shelf and it would 
be a foot away." 
One of the most noticeable changes 
has been moving the cashier counter 
from the side to the front of the store. 
"This way we can see all the way down 
the aisles. People were stealing from 
areas we couldn't see," said Manager 
Mary Johnson. 
Wawa's has also 
installed a full width mirror in the rear 
of the store which allows cashiers to see 
the back shelves. Because 'hot' items 
(tuna fish, sardines, SPAM and small 
jars of Maxwell House coffee) were 
disappearing faster than they were 
being sold, they have now been placed 
behind the counter with the O.T.C. 
drugs where they can be well guarded. 
So remember to ask for your tuna fish 
by name. 
"We've also added another sandwich 
area so two people can work on the 
sandwiches without bumping into each 
other," said Johnson. Specials such as 
"The Meatball Express" and "Mac n' 
Cheese" are listed on a spanking new 
blackboard 
next 
to the sandwich 
menu. And those famous two for 
99cent "wa-dogs" have been moved to 
the other side of the sandwich section, 
thus preventing a long line of people

waiting for both sandwiches and hot 
dogs. 
"This Wawa's is not like other 
Wawa's," said 
Ostrom, who has 
worked for six years in the Wawa 
chain. 
"Most Wawa's are just 
neighborhood stores where people go 
for bread and milk and other things 
they run out of. But no one does hot 
dog and sandwich business like we do. 
People from other Wawa's come in 
here and are in disbelief at the business 
we do. We sell a helluva lot of hot 
dogs." W awa's also sells a hell of a lot of 
soda, candy and potato chips, and now 
devotes full length aisle space to each of 
them. 
"We've added another soda machine 
and our three coffee machines have 
been pulled out of their corner so 
they're more accessible," said Johnson. 
"No one could get in during coffee 
rush." One beverage Wawa's has 
discontinued because of low sales is 
beer. And the space-devouring ice 
chest is gone, replaced by more shelf 
space. To make room for bags of ice 
Wawa's has cut down on frozen foods, 
but is marketing some of its own 
brands "including Wawa ice cream ," 
said Ostrom, "which is supposed to 
have less air in it than Haagen Daz." 
Wawa fruit bars have replaced imports 
from California, and Wawa frozen 
yogurt should hit the shelves soon. 
A regular customer approaches the 
counter. Ostrom knows her by name 
and asks if she wants change for bus 
money. The customer, an elderly 
woman, smiles and nods. What did she 
think of the changes? "When I first 
walked in here I thought I was in the 
wrong store!" she said. Then she 
smiled at Linda, "But it's nice this way 
and people know me here." Ostrom 
greets many customers by name and 
chit-chats while she gets their change. 
She feels good about the renovations. 
"It's more efficient this way. The flow 
pattern is a lot better," she said. 
Johnson agrees, "But the real test will 
be when the kids come back."
