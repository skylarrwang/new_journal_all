"The house with all the 
junk hangin' all over 
it? Sure, that's crazy 
ol' Griffin Manning 
that lives there. Go 
ahead on in and 
knock on his door; 
he'll talk to you." 

If you ask Griffin Manning why he has 
decorated the outside of his house with 
wagon wheels, bird cages, 
plastic 
horses, a model log cabin and other 
children's toys, he'll hesitate for a 
moment, and then say, "Because I am 
an odd 
sort of person." 

It's 
a 
description he's accustomed to offering 
to his 
wife, 
family, 
friends and 
neighbors, all of whom have been 
calling him crazy for most of his life. 

He isn't bothered too much any more 
that those closest to him have failed to 
understand a passion for what he calls 
"antiquish" things, and he now happily 
accepts that only people of "higher 
thoughts and education" realize that 
Griffin Manning is more than just a 
crazy old man from New Haven who 
lives in a funnv-looking house on 
Winchester Avenue Each time some 
such person, receptive to the uncon-
ventional, stops by his home to take 
pictures- and this has happened once 
every few months for the past 23 
years- the occasion reassures 
Manning that he is not alone in his 
peculiar tastes and that those who have 
labeled him crazy or, less affection-
ately, "too eccentric for his own or 
anybody else's good," will have to 
swallow their words. 

Griffin Manning turned 72 last 
M ay, and he has been living on 
Winchester Avenue, just a few blocks 
from Yale Un iversity's ominous Kline 
Biology Tower, for the past 30 years. 

The neighborhood around his house is 
residential, and not u ntil recently have 
the transient kind of people associated 
with the U niversity started to move in. 

Still, 
few know about Manning's 
house, and those who do either live in 
his neighborhood or have once gotten 
lost, on a walk or a drive through New 
Haven, and have come across it unsus-
pectingly. Invariably they have found 
a novelty, the unrecognized art, they 
might say, of a poor man. 

The houses on H illhouse Avenue 
exude g randeur, classic a n d 
uncontested elegance. Two blocks 
away along Sachem Street is one of 
Yale's unofficial borders with the real 
New H aven, the 
~ .. ely G. Mwid 
M emorial Lib rar~ Winchester:\venue 
begins in fron t of M udd Library, and 
Griffin Manning's house is only three 
blocks away. Winchester has been 
holding out against the gentrification 
that presses from the east. Just one 
street over, the houses h ave all been 
renovated: rotting boards replaced, 
freshly painted inside an d out, sod laid 
in over new, more fertile soil, an alarm 
system connected to all doors a nd 
windows and almost always a new 
fence, an u gly wire fence to keep 
outsiders out. 

But Winchester Ave., the last one 
before the lot that separates this 
neighborhood from a major housing 
project, has been resisting. T he houses 
here are incongruous, not in style, but 
in degree of deterioration. In the first 
block up from Sachem, along the left 
side of the street, two sets of five new 
row houses are going up. Fram es and 
plywood now, a strong wind m ight 
settle their u nsturdiness, and yet it 
seems 
that 
t~ey face 
a n 
o ld 
neighborhood without hu miliation.

or eight, sitting on his bicycle, riding 
it-if you could call it that-in the 
front yard of a newer house. A fence 
kept him in, relegated to a small patch 
of grass; "vv" ooom," and he stood still, 
balancing himself, 
his feet just 
touching the ground. 

Before the next intersection, still less 
than 150 yards from Mudd Library, 
Windsor Pharmacy draws a crowd to 
its comer lot. It's a good day to hang 
around and listen to music, which 
spills out of radios from parked cars, 
from boxes slung over shoulders, from 
inside 
the pharmacy and 
the 
convenience store across the street, 
and from nearby houses. It all blends 
together, but with so much open air, it 
remains music 
instead of noise. 

Everyone out here has some connec-
tion to the old neighborhood, and 
outsiders receive stares to assure them 
that they are not passing through 
unnoticed. No hostility; just setting 
things straight. 

On the 
next 
block, 
Griffin 
Manning's block, a large open lot, 
which might one day become prime 
ground for more building, opens up to 
the left. For now, cars fill in some of 
the space, grazing like old, dry cows in 
a field where mounds of trash, dirt and 
scraggly brush have replaced tender 
clumps of grass. Most cars in this 
neighborhood are a 
recognizable 
breed, dented and aging American 
models, built during the seventies with 
hungry engines and rusted shells. 

Some are in worse shape than others, 
plastic taped over a missing window or 
cement blocks holding up a frame 
without engine or tires, and these 
especially seem to haunt the streets. 

The empty lot stretches back a ways-
Winchester is the last street of the 
neighborhood in this direction - and 
comes to an end at the foot of a 
14-story housing project, built with 
dull red bricks and window after 
window, 
shutterless and 
uniform 
except for the broken or boarded ones, 
which outnumber the rest. Between 
Winchester Avenue and the project 
runs a 
single line of abandoned 
railroad tracks- remnants of the old 
Farmington Canal line-overgrown, 
like the lot surrounding them, with 
weeds and trash. 

Across from the lot, in the middle of 
a block, stands Griffin Manning's 
house, a simple two-floor structure, 
narrow from the street but deep in 
back, a low chainlink fence separating 
the small, overgrown front yard from 
the sidewalk. Stripped down, the house 
would be hard to distinguish from 
others nearby. But along the fence and 
the near side of the house hangs an 
assortment of wagon wheels, some 
large enough to have really been used 
at one time, and others as small as a 45 
rpm single, but all painted beige, aqua 
or a pale blue. A two-tone plaster 
rooster, perched where the near-right 
corner of the house meets the fence, is 
like a fill-in guard dog. A platform, 
secured by wire to the top of the waist-
high gate and held up by diagonal 
supports underneath, stretches toward 
the street. On top of it sits a model log 
cabin, about one foot wide, six inches 
deep and eight tall. Just inside the gate 
stands an uprooted, narrow tree, the 
bark shaved smooth and its trunk

freshly painted aqua blue. One of the 
three or so bare, spindly branches rests 
against a bird cage that hangs from a 
corner of the front porch. Wrapped on 
t\'110 sides with chicken wire, it sways 
slowly and noiselessly, no more than 
six feet off the ground. Inside the cage 
are some of the strangest treasures. No 
nest or seed here, nothing really that 
one might expect in the average bird 
cage, but miniature horses of different 
sizes, colors and poses piled around a 
model car that looks like a 1920's 
roadster, painted red with black trim 
but faded from the sun and rain; and 
life-size birds with plastic feet molded 
together, their heads somehow caught 
between the thin gold bars of the cage, 
are suspended above the cage floor. A 
chain of silver-painted French coins, 
without denomination, but each the 
size of a nickel, weaves in and out of 
objects near the <.age's top. The cage 
resembles the house itself, a studied 
disorder, the kind of house that might 
appear in a child's fantasy. 

On the corner of Winchester and 
\1\'oodland, a man who limps and 
hisses through his teeth when he laughs 
sits behind the counter of a small, 
musty liquor store. '"You mean the 
house with all the junk hangin' all over 
it?" he says '"Sure, that's crazy ol' 
Griffin ~lanning that lives there. Go 
ahead on m and knock on his door; 
he'll talk to you." Through the side gate

door: Vi,ian ~tanning. Griffin's wife. 
answers. "I don't have nothin to do 
with all the junk out there; that's my 
husband's doin'," she says. Although 

she 
is 
72, 
like 
her husband, 
and must use a cane to get around the 
house because of arthritis, she is a 
lively, sharp woman. and a little 
suspicious. "You wanna talk to my 
husband?" she asks incredulously, and 
then pauses, studying the stranger. 
"Well, alright, come on in. He's 
through that door in the back." 

In the corner of a dimly-lit dining 
room crowded with enough furniture 
for 
two 
rooms 
its 
size, 
Manning sits nestled in a small stuffed 
chair, wrapped in a pale green blanket. 
Vivian explains that he isn't ill really, 
just a little cold. Only his foot moves, 
tapping softly to jazz that fills the 
room, emitted at near distoruon level 
from two bookshelf speakers in the 
opposite corner. Not an inch of wall 
space in the dining room is left 
uncovered by paintings, ornate 
mirrors, posters and postcards. Across 
the top of the service, someone has 
carefully arranged collections of china 
and ceramic nick-nacks, including sets 
of matching horses, some as small as a 
thumb, one family of painted birds and 
a miniature nativity scene. One table 
holds an assortment of old-fashioned 
buffet lamps, and, under another 
table, on top of which the stereo was 
playing, 
are stacks and stacks of 
records, a quick estimate of no less 
than 200. 

Griffin Manning has always loved to 
collect things, and his passion for 
music has developed into what he 
considers "the greatest collection of any 
one person" of old Gospel, Country, 
Opera and Jazz records. To convince 
the skeptic, Manning has his wifl"
