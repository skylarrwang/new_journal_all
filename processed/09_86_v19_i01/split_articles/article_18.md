and if anyone tried to touch him we'd 
slap their hand away. We were back-
stage with him for this artists panel he 
was on with Pete· Shelley, Dwight 
Yoakum, Red Hot Chili Peppers, 
Kurtis Blow, LL Cool J, Lesley Gore. 
He's real out there, completely burnt, 
and we're making these drug cracks. 
Someone says ' .. oh he should meet 
Sid-' 'You gave him ACID? Jesus, he 
can't have that stuff!' Anyways, they 
had the first six rows reserved for 
guests of the panel members and it was 
' ... oh you're with Mitch, aren't you, 
right this way .. .' and they ushered us 
right up to the good seats." 

As for landing their single, "The 
Backyard," on WPLR, Ray was, to say 
the least, shocked. Not that the song 
doesn't deserve airplay; hell, it should 
be Number One with a bullet. Could 
be, 
too. "The Backyard" is a 
groovesome tune built on a solid bass 
hook of stunningly evocative simpli-
city. Like the greatest pop music it 
makes 
perfect 
sense. 
It's 
appre-
hended completely; bass, 
guitar, 
drums, and voice locked into a whole 
greater than the sum of its parts. The 
song has an organic, living quality; it 
wasn't produced, it was born. And like 
the greatest pop music, the lyrics (here 
a remembrance of things past) go 
straight to the heart. You are left 
thinking that every word of it is true, at 
least as long as the music lasts. But 
even so, it has never been the business 
of big-league local radio to promote the 
music of independant local bands. "We 
didn't even send them a copy of the 
record," says Ray. "We had this 
attitude of 'Why bother?' Then one 
night they all came to a 
show. 
Somebody said ' ... omigod, WPLR is 
here.' They loved us and asked us to 
send them a record, which we couldn't 
believe. Phil from Cutler's finally had 
to tell us 'Hey, send these guys a 
record, they're serious.' Being on the 
radio, well, that's been a real thrill for 
me." 

When the band delivers their second 
record there should be plenty more 
thrills in store. Says Ray: "We hope to 
start recording in November and have 
an album out maybe early next year, 
but you don't like to say that. It jinxes 
everything." And, Mark reminds him, 
he was saying the same thing a year 
ago. "The Backyard was wimpy," Ray 
adds. "Acoustic guitars on everything. 
We were more rough and then we got 
wimpy around the time of the album. 
Now we're pretty rough again." That's 
putting it mildly considering the pull-
out-the-stops cover of Led 
Zep's 
"Communication Breakdown" (a real, 
um, crowd pleaser) Miracle Legion 
has added to their set. 

Chances are Miracle Legion will 
leave Connecticut's Incas Records to 
sign with a British label, Making 
Waves. The general plan is to conquer 
Britain and then tackle the U.S. 
England is a small place, which makes 
achieving mass success there an easier 
and more feasible thing than it is here. 
Making sub-culture into pop-culture is 
a way of life for the British in a way it 
never (breakdancing excluded) has 
been in America. Their first full length 
album will have to be imported back to 
their own hometown. But the hope is 
that by that time ML will have risen to 
the top of pops in the U.K., a U.S. 
label will pick them up for American 
distribution, and everyone coast to 
coast will be turned on and tuned in to 
Miracle Legion's rock 'n roll songs of 
innocence and discovery. 

Miracle Legion mines territory that 
rock 'n roll doesn't usually tap into: 
innocence, integrity, the way memory 
defines the present, the way the heart is 
attached. Their lyrics are beautiful and 
simple, without the ironies that have 
haunted rock 'n roll since its ironic 
underpinnings (white kids appro-
priating black music styles) became 
clear: 

It/Unlc il was the lowest day of the year, 
Even still we started foes with the em«rs. 
T1le sweetest man held on at the top of the hill, 
T1le sweetest lady held on to her mmwria. 
T1le world was so big, 
And I was so small, 
Your voice was always the loudest of all. 

The cover of The Backyard is a baby 
picture of Mark Mulcahy playing in 
his yard. Mulcahy is quick to deny the 
record is a childhood album ("we're not 
that smart," he quips), but it's clear 
that the band values innocence and 
simplicity. "Just say hello," begins Side 
Two of The Backyard, "it means a lot to 
me." They have retained the spirit of 
infancy even into adulthood and 
recognize that adult problems are 
problems we've known all our lives. 
When they pose these problems with a 
child's innocence they strike deep 
chords that reverberate through the 
whole of our memories. "Just Say 
Hello" is no Jonathon Richman kiddie 
song, but it brings mystery, childhood 
mystery, 
to adult 
loneliness and 
longing: "The only one in the tree, and 
if I fall will someone pick me up? Just 
say hello, it means a lot to me." 

According to rock 'n roll's mythos, 
rock is youth culture as rebellion, 
electrified sounds of sex or rage. "Let's 
spend the night together," sneered 
Mick Jagger; 
the 
Rolling Stones 
shocked the agents of respectable 
responsibility the same way Elvis' 
swivelling hips had years before and 
Prince's naughtiness would years later. 
But Mark Mulcahy asks "Will you 
wear my coat of butterflies?" In place 
of rebellion, Miracle Legion offers 
innocence; in place of sex, love. 

Their is not a complete acceptance 
of respectable responsibility. "Country 
Boy," a 
song intended for their 
upcoming album, shows both the 
allure and unacceptablility of home 
life. Mulcahy sings of wanting the girl 
next door, with her doll house you can 
stand up in, but something's wrong; he 
can't fit into the old world. "I'm not 
ready, I'm not ready to go. I've been 
wishing for this, but let's wait just a 
little bit longer." Standing on the edge 
of marriage, or some sort of 
commitment, Mulcahy sings from the 
perspective of a 
lost 
boy 
in 
Never Never Land, a perspective rock 
'n roll has never known before. The 
rejection of home life comes from 
understanding, not disdain, and it 
communicates so much more than 
contempt. From the perspective of a 
lost boy comes an adult vision. The 
results are remarkably compelling. 

Sitting in the Almar Diner I pitch all 
this to Mark and Ray. I expect them to 
respond with cliches, the big kind, the 
kind I keep finding in their songs. 
'Yeah,' I'm hoping Mark will say, 'all 
you need is love.' Instead I get a gut-
punch quip. 
Desperate, 
without 
bearings, I play my ace in the hole: 
"A ... urn .. friend of mine once wrote me 
that a Miracle Legion show should be 
more like a child's birthday party than 
a rock concert. .. urn ... what do you 
have to say to that?" 

"If that's his conception of fun, sure," 
quips Mark. 

This is it, I've had enough. This 
from a man who when he performs 
rocks 
back and forth 
with arms 
flopping loosely, like rock's Raggedy 
Andy. This from a man who weaves 
around the stage like a toddler until he 
finds the mike-stand to anchor himself, 
then grabs the mike with both hands, 
closes his eyes, and sings: "Yesterday 
we cut down the apple tree, the sound 
of cracking wood made my little heart 
tremble. I wish I didn't have to try so 
hard, but a little boy has a lot to 
remember." No quip is going to 
account for all that. 

Pressed, Mulcahy says the band's 
relationship to the.ir audience is "like 
when you used to go on vacation with 
your cousins. You're all real uptight 
the first few days 'cause you think
