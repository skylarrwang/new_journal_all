At Yale, Dr. Mary Lake Polan tests a cure for almost half of all female infertility. 
Deep in a maze of silent dimly-lit 
hallways 
inside 
the Yale 
medical 
school, only large blue boards with 
white letters give the uninitiated a 
sense of immediate location. Maps are 
hard to find, arrows do not exist. Even 
white-frocked nurses and technicians 
who every now and again emerge from 
one of the countless identical doorways 
give contradictory advice when asked 
for directions. Knowledge here is 
focused; this complex system was not 
designed for the uninformed. On the 
non-descript third 
floor of a non-
descript wing some know as Farnam 
and others don't know exists is the 
department of the Obstetrics/Gynecol-
ogy (OB/GYN) section of reproductive 
endocrinology. Here, three doctors test 
a potential cure for endometriosis. 


Not many people know about endo-
metriosis. It does not cripple, nor does 
it blind. A serious disease, though 
unsensationalized, endometriosis af-
fects only women. Causing the major 
portion of female infertility, it can be a 
very painful condition. Only recently 
have women been aware that it can be 
easily treated and cured. After all, it 
has only been in recent years that 
women have entered the medical 
profession. Although men continue to 
do the bulk of the medical research into 
the causes of infertility, the three doc-
tors researching this disease at Yale are 
women. Dr. Florence Comite, Dr. 
Mary Lake Polan and Dr. Karen 
H utchinson comprise the Infertility 
Group Practice. Polan, long affiliated 
with Yale, was the first woman to 
finish a residency in Yale's OB/GYN 
department in 1978. Now, w1th the 
endometriosis study, Polan has been 
breaking ground in the realm of 
women's medicine- but 
both 
the 
research as weU as this pioneering 
woman doctor remain unrecognized 
outside academic circles. 


In the last 20 years, since the 
women's movement, an interest has 
been sparked in the medical research 
field 
of infertility. Traditionallv 
thought to be primarily a "'omen's 
problem, infertility affects both sexes 
almost equally. Women comprise 60 
percent of aU reported cases of inferti-

Endometriosis, in turn, makes up 
as much as 25-50 percent of female in-
fertility. The drug that the Infertility 
Group is testing is GnRHa, medical 
shorthand for Gonadotropin Releasing 
Hormone analog. Thanks to GnRHa, 
women who p_reviously couldn't bear 
children now can. 


Laparoscopy, a procedure in which 
Polan inserts a thin fiber optic tube 
through the patient's navel, allows pic-
tures to be taken of the pelvic region in 
order to check for the presence of en-
dometrial growths. An associate pro-
fessor of OB/GYN who has received 
both M.D. and Ph.D. degrees, Polan 
has written reams of papers on en-
dometriosis in her career. She con-
ducts laparoscopic tests on women in 
the study before their medical treat-
ment and then again six months later 
to observe whether the growths have 
disappeared. 


Women have only just begun to 
enter surgical fields like OB/GYN. 
Most 
women 
who have entered 
medicine in the past have steered clear 
of surgical fields, which have remained 
male-dominated. But Polan was born 
in a generation who grew up during 
the first wave of American feminism. 
She c,laims not to be as "flamboyant" as 
one of her colleagues in medical 
school, Or. Elizabeth Morgan, who 
after breaking into the field of plastic 
surgery wrote an autobiographical 
account of her experiences in a book 
entitled Th~ .Makmg of a Woman Surg~on. 
Yet they shared similar experiences. 


Though currently on maternity 
leave, Polan has not slowed down her 
pace. Five weeks ago she gave birth to
her third child, Scott. She spends 
mornings in the office, trying to catch 
up on paper work, and afternoons by 
the club pool with her children, trying 
to catch up on their lives and her 
reading at the same time. Standing 
beside her family-sized sedan in the 
club parking lot one afternoon, she 
seemed harried. She bent over the 
stroller she had just pulled out of the 
trunk and hurriedly forced it open. 
"Hang on, I'll be ""ith you in a second. 
I'm .... " Her words trailed off as she-
reached into the back seat of the car. 
She re-emerged holding a red-faced 
baby in her arms. "Oh no. He's wet 
again. His diaper's going to have to be 
changed." She reached into the car 
once more, this time grabbing a 
magazine which she tucked in beside 
the baby in the stroller. Against a solid 
red backl'('round, the white words on its 
cover read: Fertility and St"ility. "Boy, I 
had no idea how hard it would be to 
have a third child -until I did it," she 
said, chuckling now that she had the 
stroller and baby en route to the pool 
where her energetic five and seven 
year-olds waited for her. She hadn't 
anticipated that caring for a new baby 
while reassuring her somewhat jealous 
older children would take so much 
energy. 


Somehow 
that just isn't 
surprising. Polan comes of the do-first-
and-think-about-the-rest-later school. 
"It was enormously stressful," she 
said of her 
residency 
at 
Yale. 
"Everybody was always watching me to 
see if I was going to fall on my face or 
not. No one was sure whether a 
woman would know. how to operate or 
whether she might cry when she got 
her perincl And of rourse. everything 
turned out just fine." On the OB/GYN


ward of the hospital, a small room with 
two beds allowed residents to catch a 
couple hours of sleep when on-call. But 
since there had never been a female 
resident before, the room had always 
been a single-sex sleeper. "When I got 
there, the other resident asked me to 
sleep in the on-call room downstairs. 
H e said his wife didn't like the idea that 
he'd have to share a room with me," 
she explained. "Come on. I'm tired. 
He's tired. What did she think we were 
going to be doing in there? I told him if 
he felt so strongly about it, he should 
sleep downstairs." The next day he 
moved. 


Polan said that to enter the medical 
world in surgery, or any field for that 
matter, women could not be merely as 
smart as their male colleagues. "We 
had to do everything they could do and 
more 
to 
compete 
for 
same 
positions," she said. "And times haven't 
changed so much." Wearing shorts, a 
shirt and sunglasses, this woman with 
short brown, slightly greying hair 
seems not at all relaxed- even 
poolside- but she remains composed. 
Polan seems to be the kind of person 
who can do five things at one time with 
ease. 


Since her residency, 
Pt'llan has 
practiced OB/GYN and has done a 
considerable amount of research into 
the causes of infertility, both male and 
female, as well as into the medical 
means to circumvent it, such as in vitro 
fertilization. 


According 
Polan, 
endometriosis, 
until a 
couple of 
decades ago, was thought only to be 
prevalent among older white women 
with nervous, 
high-strung person-
alities, but research since then has 
shown it to be egalitarian in nature, 
affecting women of all age groups and 
races- but still 
a 
misunderstood 
disease. While neither contagious nor 
considered genetic, endometriosis still 
may run in a family. 


Because of the pain endometriosis 
can cause, most women seek medical 
treatment. 
The 
two 
most 
classic 
symptoms, according to Hutchinson, 
are severe pain during menstruation 
and intercourse. "Women have come 
in who have actually put an end to 
their sexual relationships because it is 
so painful," she said. During gyneco-
logical exams, physicians can feel 
abnormal growths in the pelvic region 
or swollen ovaries, but most of the 
time, endometriosis goes undetected. 


A "retrograde flow" of endometrial 
tissue causes endometriosis. During 
menstruation the endometrial tissue 
flows out of the uterus, causing the 
bleeding associated with periods. In 
the "retrograde flow" case, some of the 
lining flows upwards into the fallopian 
tubes and into the pelvic region outside 
the uterus. There, the tissue adheres to 
organs such as the fallopian tubes, 
ovaries and the exterior of the uterus 
itself. Because this displaced tissue 
responds to the same hormones as the 
tissue in the uterus, it goes through the 
menstrual cycle of growth and bleeding 
as well. 


When these endometrial 
growths block the fallopian tubes, 
preventing eggs released from the 
ovaries from reaching the uterus, or 
when 
they cover 
the ovaries
