favorites 
are Count 
Basie, 
Eddie 
Arnold, Wayne King, Nelson Riddle, 
Frank Sinatra, Leona Price, Dizzie 
Gillespie and Willie Nelson. But Duke 
Ellington holds a special standing in 
Manning's ranks. "Outside of his 
music, jazz, Duke Ellington was the 
best-dressed man, and he didn't take 
from the magazines," he says. "There 
were styles, this and that, but he was a 
self-stylist." Manning hesitates a 
moment and then his face begins to 
break into a wide smile "And I'm a 
self-stylist," he says. "If you'd seen me 
when I was young, Griffin Manning 
was one of the sharpest black men that 
has ever 
lived." At

:Manning's laughter can be heard from 
the next room. "That's true!" says 
M anning. "And j ust like I am a self-
stylist dresser, I am a self stylist on my 
house."

his house,

inspiration, Griffin does believe that 
his moral attitudes correspond to h is 
decorative sensibilities. "I caJJ m yself 
some kind of Christian-feelin' person ," 
he says, "and I am for right against 
wrong for all times, no matter who you 
are-it makes no difference to me. 
And, just like I am odd in my belief in 
right," he continues, raising his hand 
in front of him for em phasis, "I am odd 
in the way I choose to decorate m y 
house." Does he consider himself an 
artist? "Yes, I do, somewhat," he 
replies, "because I knew there wou ld be 
people like you. I knew there would be 
people that like those little antiquish 
things out there and who cou ld see that 
they are nice right where they are." 

Born in Hartsville, South Carolina 
on May 9, 1914 to Sally and Albert 
Manning, Griffin Manning moved 
north to Washington, D.C. at 17, 
hoping to find the nation's capital less 
severely struck by the Depression. In 
Washington, Manning stayed with his 
sister, but work was sporadic at best, 
so after two years he headed. to 
Philadelphia, where he met and was 
married to Vivian Clarke in 1935. 
Mrs. 
~Ianning used to fight her 
husband's eccentric tastes in household 
design "But I ga,·e into him after I got 
really old and inconsistent," she 
explains. ~\\'ho cares any more; we 
were married 51 years ago this ~ une, 
and 'Let him do what he wants,' is what 
I sav now." 

~i.ife in Philadelphia in the 1930s 
was ~o bad," Vivian says later, "but 
not worse for us than the average black 
person." 1\.fanning found a job as a 
cook in a restaurant called Lenton's, a 
stroke of luck that he credits to 
President Roosevelt's National Relief 
Act (NRA). "At that time," he says, 
"they were working 12 and 13 hours a 
day, six days a week at Lenton's, but 
when the NRA broke out, they made 
them cut it to eight hours a day, so they 
had to hire more cooks. And I worked 
there for 
fourteen years." The 
Mannings and 
their only child, 
Christopher, born in 1936, lived in the 
same two-room apartment in a poor, 
all-black neighborhood during their 
entire stay in Philadelphia. Griffin 
Manning earned $16.30 a week for two 
jobs, and Vivian added an extra two or 
three dollars when she could get work 
scrubbing floors or washing clothes. 

Manning has a favorite story about 
the Depression years. "I remember we 
used to see people sittin' out waitin' for 
their welfare checks to come in, and 
there were so many people you could 
never imagine it. And there was a time 
when the mailman didn't have their 
checks, right in our block , and they 
jumped on the mailman and beat him 
up on the spot. Hah! It's hard to 
believe, I know, but that's a fact. I 
mean, that's really a fact." He likes this 
story because "it shows you how bad it 
was, but it don't make you sick to listen 
to 
it. " 

Nevertheless, 
Manning 
remembers the De.,::-.. ssion as some-
thing young people today would never 
believe could happen in this country. 
"It was the most pitiful sight you have 
ever seen in your life," he remembers. 
"To see these desperate people-and 
the people weren't out to rob some-


"Now I realize that we 
being here, as poor as 
we are, my wife and I 
are very lucky, 
because there are so 
many more people 
that are worse off than 
we." 

body, try in' to rob somebody; they 
were just hungry, hungry and in want 
of a place to sleep." 

When the Mannings moved to New 
Haven in 1948, financial strains began 
to ease slightly, and in 1956 they were 
able to buy their current house on 
Winchester 
AYe. According to Mr. 
Manning, they were the first blacks to 
move into the neighborhood, but he 
doesn't remember any racial problems. 
"I have always gotten along wherever I 
go," he says. "And you might say I'm 
goin off the rocker, but I'm not. I don't 
fear nobody, and, as a matter of fact, 
when people come around me, if they 
be around me long enough, a whole lot 
of people like me, because they know 
they ain't in danger." 

Throughout his ·life in New Haven, 
until his retirement seven years ago, 
Manning worked as a cook, first at a 
restaurant called Restland Farms in 
North Haven, then at an orphanage 
called Highland Heights. 
From 
1960-1963 he ran his own business, 
Grifrs Barbecue, on Dixwell Avenue, 
but returned to the orphanage when 
the restaurant fell 
through. 
Even 
during the smoothest times, however, 
the Mannings have never been far 
from poverty. The past seven years 
have been especially hard; but Mr. 
Manning still 
views his situation 
optimistically. "Now I realize that we
