thousands, 
intent on "making it" 
professionally, the joy of doing theater 
can be easily crushed by the difficulty 
of supporting oneself, 
and 
the 
creativity easily replaced by 
competition. In order to play Kate 
with the Performance Studio, Deanna 
Dunmyer commuted for five weeks 
from New York, where she is pursuing 
a professional acting career. "I love the 
New Haven Theater community. 
There's not an ego problem here, it's 
smaller, there are common factors in 
people's lives. And really, in New 
York, except for Broadway and OfT, 
they aren't really any better there." If 
other projects came up that interested 
her with the Performance Studio, she 
would probably repeat the commute 
and the sacrifice in pay. "I get tired of 
New York and of aJI the bullshitters in 
the business. Here, I find a much more 
supportive atmosphere, that you can 
grow in. And that's what this play has 
been about." 

When Taming of the Shrew opened 
under a cloudless night, you could see 
that theater does not need walls, equity 
pay, or New York to be done as it 
ought to be done. Watching the diverse 
group of people that has come out to 
see Shakespeare, Joey Tomorrow 
observed: "Everyone needs theater in 
their life. Playing is an important way 
of releasing the tensions of day to day 
survival, of reinforcing family and 
community ties." His words may not 
fully describe the scene yet, but 
gathering part of New Haven together 
on the Green is a start. Certainly, the 
risks of an open theater remain.
