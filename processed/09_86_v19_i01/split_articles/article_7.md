Between the Vines/ Tamar Lehrlch 
Guarded Speech 
It only takes one question to reveal 
where a Yale has spent this past 
summer-just mention the name 
Wayne Dick and if you receive a blank 
expression, they've probably been off 
in Paris or the Soviet Union or maybe 
even Seattle. Otherwise, the latest 
news creation of The Village Voice~ Nat 
Hentoff will be all too familiar- it's the 
story of how a poor Christian boy from 
Florida came up north to a big, liberal 
Ivy-League school, expressed his views 
on the immorality of homosexuality 
and was slapped on the hand by the 
University for his "bad speech." At 
least that's the way Hentoff told the 
story. 

After working for a national T.V. 
news program this summer, I've grown 
sensitive to the extreme power of the 
media- the extent to which a small, 
select group of people in this country 
determine what is and is not news-
worthy. Think about the death of' 
basketball player 
Len 
Bias, 
the 
promising young athlete who died 
from a cocaine overdose. The media 
dug their teeth into it, and now 
Reagan's giving out urine samples and 
shaking hands with Mexican president 
de Ia M adrid while promising to put a 
stop to drug trafficking. If the media 
hadn't taken hold of the Bias story, 
would we now be waging a nation-
wide war against crack? I've become 
wary of journalists and their motives, 
convinced that 'objective' and 
'unbiased' reporting is but a myth, 
mistrusting of words themselves. 

In mid-July, Hentoff came out with 
his four-part series on Wayne Dick, 
DC'88, who had taken sole respon-
10 The New Journal/September~. 1986 
sibility for last April's BAD week '86 
posters. The posters had satirized 
Yale's annual 
Gay and Lesbian 
Awareness Days (GLAD) and had 
parodied Professor John Boswell, 
Patrick Santana, JE'86, and Ned 
Lochaya, TC'87 (also known as Aimee 
Zing). The Executive Committee 
found his posters threatening to the 
Yale community and gave Dick two 
years' probation. As I followed the 
case, I began to see all too clearly the 
way a journalist can seize upon an 
event and thereby create an issue out 
of it, shaping it into a story which the 
public will swallow whole as though it 
were objective truth. 

Discussing the issue earlier this 
summer, I found myself instinctively 
wanting to defend Santana, who had 
brought the charges against Dick. But 
because I didn't know the details of the 
case (Hentoff pad presented them 
rather muddily) and had only vague 
memories of the BAD week '86 poster, I 
was left inarticulate. Asked if I'd want 
posters to be taken down which 
portrayed a different group-jocks, 
perhaps- in a defamatory way, I was 
silenced. But then I tried to explain 
that Hentoff had taken a skewed 
perspective- he obviously had not 
tried to talk with Santana; he had

exaggerated the impact that a sentence 
of two years' probation would have on 
Dick's future . 

In the following weeks, I gathered 
articles on the case from The Voice, The 
New Haven Register, The Boston Globe, 
and Human Events, a paper put out by 
Accuracy in Academia which called 
GLAD a "campus-wide celebration of 
perversion 
the whole 
m ess 
winding up with a dance." Yet, even 
with all of that paper in front of me, I 
felt as though certain voices -.:were 
missing. 

Then I spoke with Carrie Costello, 
DC '86, and more pieces began to fall 
into place. I discovered that Pat 
Santana and Caroline Jackson, 
director of the Afro-American Cultural 
Center, brought a grievance against 
Wayne Dick not for the BAD week '86 
poster per se but because Dick had 
specifically singled out Santana-a 
quite important point which Hentoff 
conveniently had failed to mention 
amidst his grand 
theories. 

The 
grievance specified that Wayne Dick 
had clearly violated the University 
Regulation in which " . . . the Yale 
College Faculty has affirmed: 1. Its 
commitment to protect free expression 
and peaceful dissent and to preserve 
mutual respect and charitable relations

among all members of the University. 
2. Its belief that physical restriction, 
coercion, 
or intimidation of any 
member of that community is contrary 
to the 
basic principles of the 
University," (Chapter I, p. 5). 

"The issue is not free speech," 
Costello said, "but protecting the rights 
of people who are harassed." She 
argued that the point of the First 
Amendment is to allow people the 
freedom of expression, and if one's 
speech frightens or threatens others, 
then it becomes a form of silencing. 
She considers the BAD wuk posters as 
having intimidated not only those 
individually mentioned, but the entire 
gay and lesbian community. "We must 
protect the rights of those who are 
being silenced," she stressed. She 
added that if Wayne Dick truly wished 
to establish a genuine dialogue and 
have a forum to express his thoughts, 
as Hentoff suggests, why didn't he sign 
the poster? Why didn't anyone take 
responsibility for it? "Wayne Dick has 
been presented by the media as a poor 
loner being stepped on 
by the 
majority," Costello said. "That's ironic 
considering that he actually falls into 
the main-stream of American 
thought." 

While agreeing with Hentoff that 
there's something wrong with the 
procedures of the Executive Commit-
tee, Costello was left confused by 
Hentofl's hidden agenda. "Why did 
Hentoff wait for the one case in favor 
of gay students to pick on the 
Committee?" Costello asked. She has 
helped organize an Ad Hoc Com-
mittee Against Defamation in order to 
secretary. 

Costello said she had been told that 
Dick was not acting alone- that the 
Tory party, of which Dick is a mem-
ber, created the poster during one of 
their meetings. So, Dick may have had 
the unfortunate task of bringing the 
poster to Kinko's, where an observant 
employee had helped Santana connect 
the face with the crime. If this is true, 
one can only wonder whether other 
Tory Party members put pressure on 
Dick to assume full responsibility for 
the act. Perhaps he had been advised 
that 
the press 
would 
be more 
sympathetic to a lone pamphleteer. I 
then hear from Costello that the poster 
was financed not by Dick, who Hentoff 
has told us "has become the first 
member of his family with a shot at 
getting a college degree," but by the St. 
Thomas a 
Becket 
House, 
Episcopalian bastion at Yale; that the 
Rev. Charles Dinkier, their chaplain, 
spearheaded the BAD-week campaign; 
and that the Yale alumni who formed 
the Emergency Free Speech Commit-
tee(EFSC) to defend Dick are mostly 
former Tory Party members. Their 
initial aim, she had said, had been to 
organize a press campaign intended to 
follow on the heels of the anti-sodomy 
laws passed in July. 

Is it true that the entire Tory Party 
was responsible for the poster? "I know 
Wayne," Rev. Dinkier said. "I know 
people in the Emergency Free Speech 
Committee . . . But I really don't 
know about that." He said that the 
tradition of the BAD week poster "goes 
way back." Are the members of the 
EFSC Tory Party alumni? "A lot of 
them are," he said. "You know, I am a 
membe.r of the Tory Party. I helped to 
found It 16 years ago." Wayne Dick 
laughed when he heard the rumors. "I 
di~ the. poster. It was on my type-
wnte~, In my handwriting," he said, 
stressmg each word. "It was paid for by 
me. It was not a Tory Party function, 
not a Becket House function. I don't 
even know who did it before."

Patricia C. Barnes, who covered the 
story for the New Havtn Register, quoted 
Rev. Dinkier in her July 10th article. 
Yet, 
she 
failed 
to 
explain 
what 
connection, if any, existed between the 
Reverend and Dick. Why would she 
ask Dinkier his opinion of the case and 
not someone else? "Well, I couldn't tell 
you that, except that I know they're 
friends-that's all," Barnes said. "I do 
think that Nat H entoff is a majo r force 
behind 
this." She 
told 
me how 
reprehensible the poster was. 

Hentoff a major force behind the 
case? Wayne Dick had been the one 
who initially contacted Hentoff. "A 
friend of mine knew him, knew he was 
fairly objective," Dick said. "Before the 
hearing, Hentoff was going to write an 
article no matter how it came out." Pat 
Santana explained that while Dick's 
attitudes were purely incidental to the 
grievance, his actions were a clear 
transgression of the principles of the 
UniversitY. "Hentoff gave the 
impression 
that Dick was 
being 
'punished' for having expresst:d anti-
gay and lesbian senument," Santana 
said. "Yet, if that were true, students 
would probably be in front of the 
Executive Committee every day." We 
spoke of how difficult it is for people 
who have never confronted prejudice 
tO empathize with those who have. If 
Santana hadn't been 
individually 
singled out, he told me, he never 
would have pursued the case. H e 
wondered tf the posters would be put 
up again this year- printed and copied 
out in Hamden or someplace. "You 
don't think it could happen all over 
again?" he asked. I didn't know how to 
respond. 

As we spoke I saw more clearly the 
12 The New JoumaliSeptember 5, 1986 
way Hentoff had distorted the issue. 
He had set up a parallel between Dick's 
BAD week poster and the divestment 
campaign's blocking of the entrance to 
the Bursar's office last spring. But 
there's a difference between sitting on 
the steps of a building, an act which 
still "preserves mutual respect among 
members of the Yale community," and 
an act of intimidation on an individual 
level. Hentoff then sets up a parallel 
between Yale's punishing Dick and 
Yale Law School students shouting 
down William Shockley in the mid-70s 
and preventing him from speaking 
when he came here to explain his 
genetic theories. There's a difference 
between allowing Shockley to express 
his opinion that blacks are inferior to 
whites, and having Shockley get up on 
a podium and single out specific 
individuals using racist language. 

"The issue just becomes slimier and 
slimier," I triumphantly said to my 
friend, Joe, 
a 
few 
days ago. 
I 
confidently told him of the Tory Party 
connections; I emphasized that the 
poster was unsigned; I showed him 
anti-Semitic caricatures which I had 
found in a book on the history of the 
holocaust-caricatures which illustrate 
popular superstitions and their persis-
tence throughout the ages. I began to 
draw a parallel between the fact that 
Wayne Dick had twisted Pat's name to 
become "Pet Sauznna" (emphasis added) 
and the age-old belief that the Jewish 
desire to control the bartks, 
government, the world was actually a 
concept derived from the Satanic 
image. 

But Joe interrupted me. 

"Look," he began rationally, pointing

to the anti-Semitic drawings, "those are 
political cartoons. You don't feel they 
should be censored, do you?" We 
talked; 
became 
less dogmatic. 
Frustration set in. I put it all aside for a 
few days in an attempt to gain perspec-
tive on a situation which has no single, 
definitive answers, 
no right and 
wrong. It's an emotionally-charged 
issue: Did Wayne Dick, or the Tory 
Party or Rev. Dinkier, violate the 
University Regulations specified on 
page 5? If Dick were denied the right 
to put up the BAD week '86 poster _in a 
setting outside University jurisdiction, 
would he be denied a right which falls 
under the umbrella of free speech? 
Censorship or slander? Free speech or 
defamation? 

Days later I sit before my notes and 
articles and words trying to arrive at a 
conclusion. Conclusions? No, unlike 
Hentoff I am not left with any grand 
conclusions. I remember the words of 
Sue Wise, a colleague of John R. 
Williams', the New Haven lawyer and 
civil rights activist who has agreed to 
defend Dick free of charge. "Santana 
showed a certain hypersensitivity that 
is only appropriate if you're not a 
public figure," Wise said. "Once you 
come into a public arena, you must 
expect to be held e p to ridicule; it's
