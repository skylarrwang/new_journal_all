themselves, infertilty is the end result. 

Traditional methods of treating the 
disease have ranged from 
hyster-
ectomy, the surgical removal of the 
uterus and ovaries, . to 
steroidal 
treatments. "The ultimate cure is to 
remove the uterus and ovaries, which 
needless to say is a devastating thing to 
do to a woman," said Polan. Though 
the procedure remains infrequently 
used 
today, doctors performed 
hysterectomies quite routinely 30 years 
ago for women with severe pain. While 
in the last several years doctors have 
been burning off the growths in major 
surgery, now they can perform the 
same procedure by laser. 

These 
surgical procedures, however, only 
remove the growths temporarily since 
they do not prevent the "retrograde 
flow" 
or tissue 
growth. 
But by 
removing the growths, at least 
temporarily, the surgery allowed these 
women to become impregnated. With 
these surgical procedures, however, 
the 
burning may 
cause 
internal 
scarring, which in turn can lead 
to another set of medical problems. 

Medical treatment developed in the 
last 20 years, on the other hand, 
attempts to control the growth of the 
endometrium through drugs. 
For 
young women who do not want to 
become pregnant but who want the 
pain to dissipate, Polan prescribes a 
heavier than usual dossage of birth 
control pills. While women taking the 
pill for birth control absorb hormones 
for only 21 of 28 days, women being 
treated for endometriosis must take 
birth control hormones every day. As a 
result, these women have no menstrual 
ble~ding at all, causing the growths to 
disappear and the pain to lessen. 

But for women who do want to 
become pregnant, physicians have 
prescribed danazol, a steroid which 
induces a menopause-like state. This 
treatment has been very effective and 
often used in the last decade. It too has 
drawbacks for it can cost as much as 
$150 a month, and its side effects may 
cause weight gain, fluid retention, 
facial hair growth, acne, oily skin and 
the development of a deep voice. 

The hormone cure, GnRHa, like 
the steroid, 
induces 
a 
pseudo-
menopausal state, but so far has not 
shown similar side effects. Injected just 
under the skin on the arm, or inhaled 
as a spray, the synthetic hormone shuts 
off the hormones responsible 
for 
stimulating estrogen production and 
thus the growth of endometrial tissue. 
The doctors ask women participating 
in the program to take the drug twice a 
day for six months. After this period, 
the doctors have found that both pain 
and blockages have disappeared, en-
abling several women to become preg-
nant. Of the 20 women who have taken 
the drug at least three patients have 
become pregnant, and the only side 
effects to taking GnRHa have been the 
usual symptoms of menopause. 

But the program remains small. 
Since April, 1985 the three doctors 
have tested the drug on two batches of 
10 women. Florence Comite, who has 
worked extensively Â·with GnRHa in 
treating precocious puberty, developed 
the endometriosis study. She applied
