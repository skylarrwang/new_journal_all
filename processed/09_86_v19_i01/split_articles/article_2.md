**Title: About This Issue**

About This Issue 
Yale's a great place. And so's New Haven. This issue of 
TNJ focuses on a variety of interesting, creative and 
thoughtful people around us- both within the Yale 
community and outside. It features an article on the 
August production of Shakespeare on the Green (the New 
H aven Green)- a look into its presentation, its actors, 
directors and audience- by Tom Augst. Jay Carney 
profiled Griffin Manning, an unusual old man with 
eclectic ideas about art and a house to prove it. For their 
views on women and 
medicine, 
Melissa Turner 
interviewed 
doctors 
at 
the 
Yale 
Medical 
School 
researching a disease which causes a large percentage of 
infertility in women. Reaching into the New Haven 
music world, Joe Levy profiled Miracle Legion, a young 
band well-known to patrons of the Grotto. Tamar 
Lehrich raises important questions about the media and 
its power to create news with her opinion piece on this 
summer's 
hullaballoo over the 
Executive 
Committee's 
punishment of the 
undergraduate 
responsible for the BAD Week '86 posters. And in a special 
review section for Yale's comic book afficionados, John 
Schachter reviews Krazy Kat: The Comic Art of George 
Herriman.
