EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
they're weird, but then you get more 
comfortable and relax, and everybody 
has a good time. The message of our 
shows is 'let's get together.'" Certainly 
their hometown shows at New Raven's 
premiere new-music nightspa, the Cafe 
Grotto (130 Crown St.), are family 
affairs. When the band showed slides 
of their trip to England in between 
songs at their Welcome Home concert 
last May, it was like they turned the 
place into their living room and invited 
the whole audience over for home 
movies. (It was no less boring than the 
real thing, but that's part of the point, 
dam mit.) And when the show ended 
with a sing-along cover of"Hey jude", 
I felt it all work. I left feeling more 
than the amped-up over-drive of rock 
energy. R enewed, knocked down to 
zero and brought back 
again, 
spiritually revitalized. 

Which is hardly the way I feel 
leaving the Almar Diner. "Any more 
questions? Have you got enough stuff 
for your project?" asks Mark. I nod. 
I'm lost, no platitudes to hold onto. It's 
when I get home that I remember two 
things 
that stop 
my head 
from 
spinning. The first is a Miracle Legion 
lyric that goes "I'm not after an 
explanation. Beauty means different 
things to me, I capture beauty in a 
conversation.'' The second is that right 
before we left the diner Mulcahy told 
me it would be alright to copy a demo 
tape he gave me and send it to that 
friend of mine who thought Miracle 
Legion shows were like 
birthday 
parties. "He sounds like a good guy," 
he said. I hardly had the nerve to tell 
Mark that my, urn, friend was really 
me, that I was just covering my own 
sentimental tracks. But I have this 
feeling he might understand.
