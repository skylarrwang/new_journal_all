characters speak
with
Chinese,
French, Irish-American or Southern
accents, or speak Spanish (usually
untranslated).
What sex is this amazing Kat, who
loves so unwisely and in turn is the
subject of so much ardour? No one is
sure, least of all Krazy.
Usually
referred to as "he" by his companions
and in captions, in one strip, Krazy
explains to Ignatz that he is enthralled
by "a embarrassment which smacks of
the connubial
I don't know
whether to take unto myself a wife or a
husband." And, when an orphan is left
on his doorstep, he wonders what to be
to it: a father or a mother, "a Unkil or a
Ent."
We see the complex and bizarre
dynamic of the love triangle evolving
from strip to strip in the Abrams book.
In the very first episodes, Ignatz
explains that he is "destined to bounce
a brick off Krazy Kat's' knob day by
day." "In view of all that mouse people
have suffered in the past from 'kats',
who can say that Krazy is not getting
what's coming to him?" he concludes,
as another brick sizzles home. During
a lull in brick tossing, Krazy pines:
"Oh, 'Ignatz', wherefore is you, 'Ignatz'
-long has I waited for you, and yet
you comest not-a-less (sic)." Krazy's is
a beautiful soul, loving every wrong
that is done him (or is it her?); we are
reminded of a simple, Christian saint.
Naturally this state of affairs drives
Ignatz into a frenzy of frustration.
Every line of his body is continually
a-quiver with rage; his mind is taut
with hate. Every one of his missles of
revenge is taken as a reaffirmation of
love; every plot is foiled before it
begins. Nevertheless he clings to the
vain hope that, someday, the Kat will
get his message. This leads to some
wild plot twists, where Krazy and
Ignatz conspire together to get the
Pupp out of their way- collaborators
with very different goals. Ah, the poor
Pupp. He loves Krazy ("that dear, dear
Kat")
with a
dogged,
unrequited
yearning. He persists in protecting
Krazy, against her will, arresting the
sinning mouse whenever he finds him
about his vengeful errand. Not once
does he realize that this will never
impress the Kat, never lead Krazy to
return his love.

Herriman arrived at a combination
of style, concept, content and language
that guaranteed that every strip would
be funny, and deeply so. How could he
lose? Every nuance of his characters,
every element of his design was
charged with wit, and their constant
lack of gratification insured that they
would continue their escapades. Krazy
Kat is, put simply, the greatest comic
strip there
has ever been,
and
l'ierriman, one of America's finest
artists.
Because Krazy ran continuously
from 1914 to 1944, a complete Kat
would take up several large volumes,
even
reprinted
in
the sometimes
annoyingly tiny size chosen by the
Abrams people. Let us hope that this
collection inspires enough
public
interest in Herriman to encourage the
publishers to bring out more and more
collections, until everyone interested in
American popular culture and art has
a shelf of Herriman books. That would
make me heppy, heppy indeed.
