The Green on a late August night. ·
Familiar
dark
shadows,
sparsely
branched
trees
and forbidding
stretches of grass. Welcome back to
New Haven. From the safety of the lit
sidewalk, you can see glimpses of ·a
stage, of lights, of people moving
about. On closer view: A short woman
in a wedding dress, looking like a white
cream-puff, circles around a large
bearded man, embraces hinl, knees
him in the groin,
and a
couple
thousand people burst out laughing.
This is not the New Haven Green you
know and love.


A Shakespeare play is not the first
thing you would expect to find while
walking
around
the New
Haven
Green. Walking by on the weekend of
August 22 during a performance of
Taming of the Shrew, you might have
been surprised to see the bright reds,
greens, and yellows of satin and lace
costumes; or the sets designed to evoke
a Paduan street scene. But for the third
year in a ro~, a local theater group
called Performance Studio presented
Shakespeare on the Green. In opening
up the Bard to the New Haven
community, the Performance Studio
challenges how we think of theater in a
city which, outside of Yale, many
people assume is culturally dead.


Amy Seham, artistic director of
Performance Studio, tries to make
Shakespeare understandable by
making him entertaining. Certainly
the audiences on the Green followed
the story of Tamin_f! of the Shrew, about a
foul-mouthed, ·independent
woman
tortured into ~ubmtssion by her strong-

willed suitor. Seham used masks to
define the characters. simply and to
· make them obvious types that we all
recognize: The foppish suitor, the idiot
servant, the romantic hero, the greedy
father. 'With
the
good
daughter
Bianca, dressed in pink, with pink
hearts dangling from lier dress, and the
unladylike Kate dressed in red, with
black slashes across her skirt, the
symbolism was clear. Seham chose to
emphasize the play's light-heartedness
as well as its theme of role-playing by
using Commedia. dell'Arte, colorful street-
theater from the . sixteenth century,
characterized by
its improvised
comedy and archetypal roles. The
result of Shakespeare on the Green was
playful, broad comedy, well suited to
the bawdiness .of Taming of the Shrew,
with the kind of physical humor that an
audience
naturally
fi!lds
funny-
characters hitting each other, being
chased around stage, and falling on
their rears.


Putting on a play on the Green, the
center of a small industrial city, raises
problems that neither a theater nor its
audience usually confront. The largest
challenge in doing outdoor theater· is of
course the outdoors. With Taming of the
Shrew, the wind blew through the sets,
blue plastic was tied around the
microphone amplifiers, and against the
ongoing threat of rain the Parks
Departlnent spent days covering and
uncovering the stage with large tarps.
Without the walls of a theater around
it, Shakespeare on the Green had no
protection from the weather or frmn
New Haven. When it fmally did rain
. '
on the opening night, the performance
had to be cancelled; after five weeks of
rehearsal, Seham and the cast would
rather
have
been
inside an air-_
conditioned theater. But taking it in
stride, they rehearsed yet again and
hoped for clear skies the next day.


Watching theater on the Green may
at
first
leav~ people feeling
unco1nfortable and distracted- es-
pecially those who are used to settling
back
in their chairs in a
quiet,
darkened theater, expecting the action
to re1nain in front ofthem on the stage.
How could anyone be absorbed by
Taming of the Shrew? After all, the Green
..is no secluded · park, no enchanted
forest where the fairies in A Midsummer
Night's
Dream
can
be-guile
imagination. The best stage designers
would -have difficulty disguising it as
the Shrew's back yard in Padua; no
one would believe it, with ambulances
racing down Elm Street every hour,
sirens blaring. The Green remains an
urban center, a fact that a stage, some
lights and costumes will not change.


When you sit down on the grass,
action both rehearsed and unrehearsed
surrounds you. And the players might
be anyone.


Seham creatively used the Green to
her advantage. How did the audience
make the transition from New Haven
to Shakespeare's Padua? During th1e
performance, when a stream of bag
people with shopping carts streamed
onto the Green, met at the war
me1norial, and then paraded through
the audie.nce hooting and dancing, an
audience metnber asked, "Are they real
