be1ng here, as poor as we are, my wife 
and I are very lucky, because there are 
so many more people that are worse off 
than we," he says. "I've had [welfare) 
grants here in this house, 'cause we are 
poverty-stricken, and my wife, you 
hear her, she doesn't want to admit 
that we are poverty-stricken, but we 
are. The only thing we have is the 
check that comes in from the social 
security every month, but neverthe-
less, glad to say, we have our house 
paid for. We've been here 30 years, so 
what I mean is, we are very lucky." 
A lack of money has been indil'e(:tly 
responsible for both the methods and 
the materials Manning has used to 
decorate his house. Whenever he coqld 
afford it, he would go to flea markets, 
garage sales and even junk yards -to 
pick out whatever caught his eye. 
Manning believes that, had he been a 
rich man, he probably would have 
collected valuable antique furniture, 
jewelry, 
trinkets and "first-rate" 
paintings. Instead, he collected a poor 
man's antiques, whatever he thought 
had an "antiquish" quality to it, but not 
a 
single item of which has any 
recognizable value beyond the base 
cost of its materials. Anything that 
could stand the weather (paintings and 
posters were disqualified) became a 
potential element in Manning's designs

for the outside of his house. He chose 
each 
item 
according to 
loose 
requirements: it should be interesting, 
unoffensive, 
and 
in some way 
compatible with items placed nearby 
it. However, aware that an artist need 



not explain his work, he politely 
brushes off requests for theoretical and 
conceptual explanations: "I only intend 
that people can see that this is a very 
special house, and that those seeing it 
will enjoy it." 
While a number of passers-by have, 
over the years, taken an interest in 
Manning's house, 
and, of those, 
several have pronounced his method of 
decoration 'art', it is unlikely that his 
work will live on after he dies. It is 
doubtful, especially with gentrification 
moving in from Mansfield Street, that 
whoever owns the house next will want 
to preserve it as it is. So the strange 
house on Winchester Avenue will be 
strange only as long as the Mannings 
live in it. "My mother and father 
taught us that God gives us three-score 
and ten years to live, and that makes 
70," says Mr. Manning. "And both of 
us, my wife and myself, are 72, so we 
are living on borrowed time." From 
inside the next room, Vivian laughs. 
"Where you borrowin' your time from, 
Grift?" she asks, and Manning himself 
begins to laugh. "Anyway, all fm 
sayin' is that, anyone anywhere who's 
interested to stop by a house such as 
mine can do so. And, to anyone who 
likes music, my wife and I are pleased 
to play records for them, because they 
can be safe and comfortable in this 
house. I am sure they would be 
entertained."
