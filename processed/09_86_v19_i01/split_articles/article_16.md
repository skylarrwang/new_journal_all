Polari, though, does not expect 
dramatic changes. What does she think 
will or has changed now that more 
women enter the field of OB/GYN? 
"Some people say that women are more 
sympathetic to women, that women 
obstetricians have a 
heightened 
sensitivity to wom en's issues. But 
remember 
t h ese 
are 
women 
physicians, they don't practice holistic 
medicine. These women have come 
out of a system, they have had to 
compete with men and have had to be 
better than them. They have to answer 
to the same tough questions, and their 
de~i~ion-making process is the same, 
not at all different." But the difference 
will be the "tenor of office encounters," 
she 
said. "You won't be greeted 
condescendingly, you know, like 'H i 
sweetie, how are you?'" 

Yale presents the best of all worlds 
for these women, for women's progress 
here can be mapped out, tangible. 
Problems can be pinpointed, and 
solutions can be found. But even so, 
finding a solution to endometriosis 
means finding a solution to only one of 
an infinite number of women's medical 
problems. Even in this field, it will take 
a couple of years for GnRH a to be 
released to the general public, and by 
then it will be very expensive, not 
accessible to most women. And, as 
always, researchers across the country 
lack the funding to examine women's 
medical problems thoroughly. But in 
the short run, Polan has found an ideal 
place for herself at Yale. And she 
knows it.
