10,000 Miracle Legion Fans 
Can't Be Wrong 
"Our music comes from the gut, like 
puke." Some bands have platitudes to 
sum up their sound and style, cliches 
more powerful than a locomotive, able 
both to come from and shape their 
attitudes in a single bound. Not 
Miracle Legion. They've got quips. 
One way to look at what's going on 
right now: I'm sitting in the Almar 
Diner with Mark Mulcahy and Ray 
Neal, singer and guitarist for Miracle 
Legion, eating a bacon cheeseburger 
and drinking a strawberry shake and 
giggling while they tell me how they 
ended up in a photo in The Village Voice 
article on the New Music Seminar . 
Another way of seeing things: I'm 
sitting in the Almar Diner looking for 
cliches, the big kind, the quotable ones 
you can hang a whole story on, and

these guys are giving me quips. "Our 
music comes from the gut," Mark 
quips. "Like puke." 

Not that Mulcahy is always so glib. 
Asked to name his big influences he 
cites Frank Capra and Gary Cooper. 
Not exactly what you'd expect from the 
singer/lyricist of New Haven's pre-
eminant band. Judging from the sound 
of The Backyard, the group's 1984 six-
song EP on Incas Records, you were 
guessing Psychedelic Furs maybe, or, 
unimaginative you, REM. Like those 
bands, Miracle Legion makes guitar-
centered pop that isn't afraid to be 
moody. But if you know Miracle 
Legion at all you know they don't 
confuse droning or mysticism with 
meaning, and if you've ever seen the 
Legion live you know how Capra and 
Cooper make perfect sense. In Capra's 
30's comedies Mr. 
Smith 
Goes 
to 
Washington, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, It's 
a Wonderful Life the central character's 
innocence and idealism are broken and 
all 
but destroyed by 
real-world 
cynicism, only to be validated and 
restored at the darkest hour by a 
communal outpouring of faith and 
love. The innocence and integrity of 
Miracle Legion's music just isn't that 
far from Capra's vision. Onstage 
Mulcahy seems, like Gary Cooper's 
Mr. Deeds, "pixalated," and when he 
gets down on the ground with the band 
ritTmg softly behind him and asks 
everyone in the audience to get down 
with him "so we can all come up 
together," and 
then 
actually 
gets 
everyone there to do it, well, let's just 


say it's the closest thing to a communal 
outpouring of faith and love you're 
liable to get at a rock 'n roll show. 

Off-stage in diners, Mulcahy is 
considerably less pixalated, sarcastic 
even. Liable to compare his music to 
puke. Which would be fine if Miracle 
Legion was one of those post-punk 
LOUDHARDF AST thrash bands 
whose- medium and message is all bile 
and overload and electronic upchuck, 
or even if they were one of those 
smartass ultra-ironic trash-culture 
bands with quips and rifTs to spare. But 
how does that quip get you any closer 
to the heart of a band that plays pop 
songs of dreamlike beauty, songs at 
once haunting and catchy, driving 
ballads that sway as they rock? How 
does it take in the way Mark Mulcahy's 
vocals convey both mystery and 
understanding? Or for that matter, 
how does it account for Ray Neal's 
whalloping guitar hooks, riffs that pull 
you right into the center of songs? It 
doesn't. Ask these guys for platitudes, 
the big kind, the quotable ones, and 
they give you quips. It's like that late 
summer afternoon you decided to 
finally give up and call 'Ollie-ollie-ox-
en-freed' only to find the kids you're 
playing with are having too damn 
much fun to come out, come out where 
ever they are. "Our music comes from 
the gut, like puke." 

"And," adds Ray as I break up 
laughing and 
knock over my 
milkshake, "gets all over everybody, 
like strawberry shake." 

Ah, well this at least gets us closer to 
the heart of things, because lately 
Miracle Legion's music has been 
getting all over everybody, or at least 
10,000 people. With 10,000 copies of 
T1ee Badcyard sold, and rave ups in the 
When Mark Mulcahy 
performs he rocks 
back and forth with 
arms flopping loosely, 
like rock's Raggedy 
Andy. 
Village Voice, New York Times, and 
Britain's New Musical Express, Miracle 
Legion has the best shot at national 
stardom of any local act since the days 
of 1956, when the Five Satins cut "In 
the Still of the Nite" in the basement of 
a New Haven church. 

Miracle Legion 
Ray Neal, 
guitar; Joel Potocsky, 
bass; Jeff 
Wiederscahll, drums; Mark Mulchay, 
vocals -
has been playing together for 
three years now. Mulchay's the group's 
veteran. He was drumming and singing 
for New Haven's Saucers in 1978 when 
they cut "A Certain Kind of Shy," a 
Phil Spector-ish slice of pure-pop for 
now people that still stands as one of 
the finest seven inches of local vinyl. 
After the demise of Saucers, Mark and 
Ray teamed up to form a farifisa 
organ/guitar duo called Plaid on Plaid. 
"I had this plaid jacket and plaid 
pants," Mulcahy explains by way of 
excuse for his painful pun on Dylan's 
Blonde on Blonde. "We thought it was 
a pretty good name. We mostly played 
basements. Ours." Rookie Jeff was 
acquired from Durham, Conn., which 
Mulcahy describes as "a farm team of 
great rock musicians. I saw him 
playing at a party there and asked him 
if he wanted to play in a band." Joel, 
who'd never played in a band before 
becoming a member of the Legion, 
came in a trade with Dumptruck, a 
Boston group Mulcahy drummed for. 
"He was a friend of Mike Priggen's. 
We 
needed a 
bassist and Mike 
recommended him." Together they 
make the sort of folk-rock that has 
nothing to do with any folk tradition, 
and less to do with R&B roots. They 
have created their own sound, their 
own musical and lyrical vision. On 
repeated listenings The Backyard sounds 
less and less like any other band and 
more like, well, Miracle Legion, or 
Miracle Legion's soundtrack for the 
great lost Frank Capra movie. 

Maybe it's just this that accounts for 
Miracle Legion's unaccountable 
success: the band has been able to 
create their own sound without the ironic 
distance or alienation of semi-pop or 
avant garde rock. For an independant-
label local group this band has a knack 
for popping up in the darndest places 
-
just take a look at the playlist of 
WPLR, New Haven's album oriented 
rock radio station (which places ML 
right alongside the likes of Springsteen 
and Tina Turner), or in England 
(where their six-city tour was nothing 
short of triumphant), or in Village Voice 
photo coverage of the New Music 
Seminar. 

"Yeah," Mark explains, "we were 
posing as Mitch Ryder's bodyguards. 
That's how we got in that picture. You 
remember Mitch R yder?" Mitch 
Ryder of Mitch Ryder and the Detroit 
Wheels, mid-60s white soul shouter 
who had smashes with "Jenny Take A 
Ride" and "Devil With The Blue 
Dress: that Mitch Ryder? "Yeah. We 
latched onto him, we seemed to have 
this special rapport with him, and we 
were just acting as his body guards. 
We'd stand there with our arms folded
