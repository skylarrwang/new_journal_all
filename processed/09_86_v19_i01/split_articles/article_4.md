A No-Sleeper 
George Hickenlooper (ES '86) and 
Kevin Burget (BR '86) might just have 
pulled the ultimate all-nighter this 
summer and made fllm history in the 
process. The two Yale ftlm majors, 
who both graduated this spring, had 
been awake for three days and nights 
in a row, frantically piecing together 
and editing The Bells of Funicelw, a 
feature length film on videotape they 
wrote and directed together as a final 
project for a special tutorial in film 
making with Yale professor Michael 
Roemer. 

Time was running short as the two 
rushed to prepare the ftlm in time for 
its !July 3 preview as part of the Yale 
Summer Film series shown in Davies 
Auditorium. Still editing with the 
preview only minutes away, Burget 
rushed off to the auditorium with the 
first of two video tapes that constituted 
the film, while Hickenlooper remained 
behind and hurriedly continued to edit 
the rematnmg 
tape. 

Luckily, 
he 
completed the second half just five 
minutes before the first tape was to 
end, rushed over to Davies and popped 
it into the machine in time for the 
audience to see the ftlm in its entirety. 
Hickenlooper and Burget had just 
managed to show a film as it was being 
made. 

..1 
was 
hallucinating from 
exhaustion while I was talking to the 
audience," said Hickenlooper, who 
along with Burget didn't see the film in 
its entirety that day because he fell 
asleep in the auditorium during the 
preview. 

Tht Bells of Funicello tells the story of 
the first three days of life at Yale for 
freshmen in the class of 1990. The 
characters 
include a 
surfer from 
southern California who is infatuated 
with Annette Funicello (ergo the title), 
and a radical Yale student from the 
1970's who happened to be locked in 
Harkness Tower during the protests, 
feels guilty about it, and has thrown a 
continuous party 
in Yale's steam 
tunnels honoring the protesters ever 
since. 

The film starring Yale students Birk 
Bilger '86, Julian Fleisher '88, Suzanne 
Cryer '88, Ron Livingston '89, Jeff 
Mays '87, Carla Power '88, Courtney 
Walsh '87, ~1ark Wesolo~ .. :ski '89, and 
Winter Mead '87. took over 50 hours 
of video tape, 123 scenes, and some 
800 shots to complete. The two ftlm-
makers spent the rest of the summer 
re-editing and polishing their two-hour 
long ftlm which will be shown again 
September 12 and 13 in the Yale 
University Art Gallery Auditorium. 

Hickenlooper said the film's visual 
quality and 
resolution leaves 
something to be desired, "but what 
really counts in a film is the story." 

Their professor must have thought so 
because despite the visual imperfec-
tions and the rushed editing, their al1-
nighter paid off-the film got an "A".

**Title: Dream Record**

Dream Record 
Some have said that at Yale, musicians 
talk a lot about starting bands but few 
groups ever materialize- all talk and 
no play. But times have changed. First 
students began forming new bands on 
campus. Then came Nadine, an eclectic 
music fanzine that helped publicize 
student bands and gave new life to 
Yale's pop music culture. 

This summer Yale and New Haven 
rock bands released a compilation 
record of songs called Some New 
Ruins- proof that the new interest in 
music here has become more than just 
a fad. Not surprisingly, the record was 
sponsored by Nadine. 

The album 
fearures two songs each from Yale 
bands Beauty Constant, the Rafles, 
Senator Flux, Cattle Collision and U 
Thant, and SxOxMx and Bleached 
Black from New Haven. It was re-
leased in the first week of June after 
months of organization and production 
by David Levine (SY,'88). With the 
help of John Robinson and Teo Bald-
win, 
two 
New Haven musicians, 
Levine recruited the bands under the 
auspices of I. V. Towers Records and 
Tom-A-Rok Productions, two com-
panies they created to record and 
promote local Yale and New Haven 
groups. 

The songs on Some New Ruins "range 
from light rock to hardcore," said 
Robinson, the director ofTom-A-Rok. 
Of the 300 original pressings of the 
album, most were given to radio sta-
tions, 
East-Coast distributors and 
promoters, while the rest were placed 
in local record stores where they are 
still available for $7 .98. In addition, 
700 more copies of the record are being 
pressed this month for future sales. 

The companies celebrated the 
album's release with a party on July 23 
at the Brick-N-Wood International 
Cafe, a local club with live shows for 
local bands. 

Most of the groups 
featured on the record performed, and 
over 250 people attended. Robinson 
saw the event as a starting point for the 
companies as well as the record. 

Robinson, Levine, and Baldwin like 
to emphasize that their efforts are 
geared towards combining the talents 
and tastes of musicians from both Yale 
and New Haven groups. In fact, each 
of them plays in at least one of the 
bands featured on the record along 
with numerous other musicians from 
both the University and New Haven. 

"We like to think our work builds a 
sense of community," Robinson said. 
"'Everybody is able to participate in the 
complete musical process and nobody 
takes themselves so seriously that they 
can't give time to one another." 

If their efforts, which include the 
upcoming recordings of two other local 
bands, Psylent Zone and the Revel-
ators, continue as planned, the dream 
described by David Levine on the back 
cover of the album may just become a 
reality-"you have your own band and 
I mine and maybe we could jam 
sometime and then I remember the 
dream; maybe this is it."
