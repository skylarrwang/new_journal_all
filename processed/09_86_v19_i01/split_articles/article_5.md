Justice, At Last 
There will probably be a book. Maybe 
even a movie. A young radical, a 
lawyer, thinks he is being framed, 
decides to flee the country and lives as 
a transient fugitive hiding from the 
FBI. In France he falls in love. But 
after 13 years he returns to the U.S. to 
clear his name of murder and conspir-
acy charges. The ending? .... 

Stephen Bingham, '64, is now a free 
man. 

On July 27, 1986, after two ~md a 
half months in the courtroom and five 
days of jury deliberation, Bingham 
was acquitted by a 12-0 vote of charges 
that he had smuggled a gun into 
California's San Quentin prison 15 
years ago, a gun that allegedly sparked 
· a bloody escape attempt. Jurors later 
spoke of too many inconsistensies in 
the prosecution's case and too little 
likelihood that Bingham had been 
anything more than a scape_goat. The 
member of a politically prominent 
Connecticut family, Bingham went to 
Boalt Hall Law School at Berkeley 
after Yale and a stint in the Peace 
Corps and had joined some friends in a 
makeshift lawyers' commune in 
Oakland. On August 21, 1971 he 
visited California's San Quentin 
prison. 

Bingham dealt mostly in 
landlord-tenant law, but on this day he 
came to San Quentin to visit Black 
Panther leader George Jackson, who 
was being held in m~imum security 
on a murder charge, to discuss a civil 
suit to improve prison conditions. 

Jackson was a trouble maker on the 
inside, the outspoken spearhead of the 
Panther~ adopted cause, the "Prison 
Movement." He was supposedly the 
most closely watched and certainly the 
best known prisoner in the country at 
the time. 

After Bingham left Jackson that day, 
there was a bloodbath at San Quentin, 
the worst in the prison's history. 
Jackson, two white prisoners and three 
white guards were killed. According to 
prison authorities and guards, the 
violence 
began when Jackson 
produced a gun on the way back to his 
cell after meeting with Bingham. It 
was an escape attempt, and Bingham, 
they said, had somehow smuggled the 
gun to Jackson. Bingham thought he 
was being framed. At the time, the 
California State government, with Ed 
Meese as Attorney General, had been 
trying 
to 
discredit 
the 
prison 
movement as well as· the lawyers who 
served as 
intermediaries between 
inmates and 
the public. When 
Bingham heard over the radio that the 
Marin County District Attorney 
claimed to have "conclusive evidence" 
against him, he decided to flee. "Had I 
stayed," he said, "there would have 
been no fair trial, no bail, and I 
wouldn't 
have survived in the 
California jails with those guards. I 
was accused of killing three of their 
colleagues." 

Bingham first went to Las Vegas, 
where, with friends' help, he was able 
to change his physical appearance and 
get a false birth certificate and social 
security card. For the next 13 years he 
went by the name Robert Dale Boarts. 
He travelled to Philadelphia, was able 
to get a passport and then flew to 
Europe. He spent the first three years 
on the move through Yugoslavia, 
Czechoslovakia, Austria and Italy, 
too afraid to stay anywhere long or to 
find work, but settled in Paris in 1974. 

Never losing his penchant for social 
causes, Bingham joined a group of 
political activists in Paris who spoke for 
struggling farmers. There he started 
painting houses for a living and 
enrolled in a film school, where he met 
and fell in love with a fellow student, 
Francoise Blesseau. 

In the later years of his hiding, 
Bingham travelled to _ Canada and 
three times crossed the border without 
detection, once to visit his parents. In 
1984, he and Francoise decided that he 
should risk life imprisonment to clear 
his name. On July 9, 1984, nearly 13 
years after the San Quentin shoot-out, 
Bingham turned himself in to the 
Marin County Sheriff. 

Now Stephen Bingham is free and 
can start life anew, but the man who 
•was often described as another victim 
of the sixties doesn't seem to have 
changed too much in 15 years. A week 
after the acquittal, he was on the front 
lines with Jesse Jackson during a civil 
rights march. As for the future, there is 
talk of following the family tradition 
into politics. And, of course, there 
might be a h<x?k . .
