Picturing Women 
Abandon all hope of starting off first 
semester with easy-going summer time 
conversations in the dining hall. This 
year a raging controversy will greet all 
Y alies who pick up copies of two publi-
cations identically titled Womm of the 
Ivy League. More than a few of us 
already may have one of the publi-
cations . Playboy magazine's September 
issue featuring nude photos of women 
from the Ivy League schools has had a 
week or so head start on its rival 
publication, which was coordinated by 
women centers representing all the Ivy 
League schools. The women centers 
have raised 12.000 doll~rs to publish 
40,000 copies of their version, 5,000 of 
which will be distributed at Yale this 
September. 


The idea to create a magazine 
protesting the Playboy issue originated 
in Yale's women center when Playboy 
was recruiting models . from the Ivy 
schools last spring. The Y alies chose 
not to respond by rallying or picketing. 
"We decided to take Pla;,boy to terms in 
its own form," said Joyce Banerjee 
(TD '86) who helped work on the 
original idea. 

Easier said than done. Though 
everyone 
involved agreed the 
magazine should in some way portray 
a more realistic, complete picture of 
women than Playboy offers, controversy 
surrounded the project from the very 
beginning over how that picture would 
be composed. Debates ·touched on the 
issues of whether nude phototgraphy 
and other forms of erotica should be 
included and whether the magazine 
should accept men's contributions. 

"It would have been interesting to 
have included thoughtful contributions 
from men who have also grown up 
under the influence of Playboy," said 
Renee Schwalberg (ES '87), who co-
runs 
Yale's 
women 
center. 
But 
Schwalberg stood in the minority, and 
the I vies voted overwhelmingly to 
exclude men's contributions to the 
magazine. Many feared that during 
the editing process there n1ight be a 
tendency not to judge men's contri-
butions solely on their artistic quality, 
but rather on the gender of their 
creator. In the end some comments 
from men were 
included in the 
centerfold, though not to everyone's 
agreement. And two men were very 
much involved in the conception and 
organization of the magazine. 

Almost everyone involved agreed to 
include erotica, but again some were 
unhappy with the end result. "The 
erotica had 
nothing controversial 
about it," said Banerjee. "We needed 
more material dealing with sexuality. 
We were timid on that issue." Ellen 
Levy (DC '86), who also took an active 
roll in the publication, agreed with 
Banerjee. "By glossing over female 
sexuality we reinforced the idea that it 
is embarrassing, a fault or a flaw, when 
really it ··should be celebrated." But as 
Schwalberg explained, "I would have 
been quite pleased to . print things that 
had more erotica than we did, but we 
didn't get any." 

While some think the tnagazine fails 
to reach women on a . more profound 
level, others feel the magazine should 
reach a broader audience on a level 
that will stir discussion and debate. 
"In my vision," said Schwalberg, "I 
targeted an audience that doesn't think 
much about the significance of Playboy; 
people who think it's fun or have 
neutral feelings toward it. We already 
know we have ari audience of Aurora 
readers, that's why we printed so many 
copies to reach other people." But 
Levy, who referred to the magazine as 
''just a more expensive Aurora," said it 
failed to offer "any new visions of how 
women see themselves_ as creative, 
sexual, and intellectual beings. We had 
the chance to challenge the paradign• 
that dichotomizes women as either intel-
lectual or sexual, and we blew it." 

In this muddle of controversy within 
controversy, one thing is sure: the 
debate over what is and what is not a 
realistic view of women is bound to 
continue in its epic form long after the 
covers of both magazines have frayed 
and faded.
