"Jizz! ... POW!" 
With this sound is accomplished the 
central act of one of America's proud-
est artifacts, for it is the sound of a 
brick bouncing ofT the head of Krazy 
Kat, the title character of George 
Herriman's stupendous early and mid-
twentieth century comic strip. What 
seems at first to be a simple, dimwitted 
slapstick routine, is, in fact, 
the 
rehearsing of a wry, witty, tender, and 
ironic destiny. Krazy Kat loves Ignatz 
Mouse, who hates all cats with a 
vengeful passion that finds expression 
in the bricks he constantly hurls 
Krazy-wards. The Kat, for somewhat 
arcane reasons, regards each brick as a 
"nize li'llove tokin." Officer B. Pupp, a 
bastion of law and order, yearns 
romantically for Krazy; whenever pos-
sible, he jails his rival Ignatz for 
assault. 

There is no celebration of violence 
here, as there is in Tom andJerry or the 
infernal Roadrunner. The brick 
functions instead as the key to a 
powerful love triangle; a ceaselessly 
comic web of relationships driven by 
frustrated hope, irrepressible longing, 
and a heartfelt sense of duty . . . no 
kidding. 

Doubters should consult the snazzy, 
new, paperbound collection of Krazy 
Kat daily strips and Sunday pages just 
released by Abrams. Patrick McDon-
nell, Karen O'Connell and Georgia 
Riley De Havenon, the three editors of 
the Abrams project, scrupulously date 
each of the more than two hundred 
strips they present. In addition, they 
include a bibliography of Herriman 
books, a chronological table of his 
career, a note on the provenance of 
their material, and two introductory 
essays. 

The first of these essays is a reprint 
of Gilbert Seldes' appreciation of Krazy 
Kat, taken from Seldes' 1924 book, The 
Seven 
Lively Arts. 
Seldes was an 
enthusiastic booster of popular arts at a 
time when to be such was more re-
markable and momentous than now. 
His scholarly and effusive treatment of 
Herriman ("a great master of the fan-
tastic") is entertaining and readable, if 
something of a period piece. But he is a 
winy and articulate professor, and 
describes several Krazy Kat episodes 
not otherwise included in the book. 

The remainder of the introduction is 
a long and fairly detailed essay on 
Herriman's life and work, written by 
the three editors. From them, we learn 
something about the glamorous life of 
early cartoonists, as well as about 
Herriman in particular. 

With the turn of the century came 
the growing realization on the part of 
newspaper publishers that a popular 
cartoonist could have a powerfully 
salutary effect on circulation. 
Homegrown artists like T.A Dorgan, 
T.S. Sullivant (single panel men), 
Winsor McCay (Little Nmw), and 
Herriman thus found themselves in an 
enviable position, negotlatmg con-
tracts that assured them fame and 
fortune in the growing art departments 
of the 
nation's newspapers and 
magazines. Dissatisfied at one place, 
they could always move on- Her-
riman made a number of treks from 
the West to the East coast and back 
again, finally settling down with the 
Hearst syndicate in 1904. (Hearst 
loved Krazy Kat, and guaranteed 
Herriman a large salary to continue 
the series, even when other strips far 
outclassed Krazy in readership.) 

The biographical essay, illustrated 
with a large number of family photos, 
unpublished Krazy paintings and 
drawings of the Krazy Kat characters as 
well as pre-Kat strips, gives a good 
sense of the kind of person Herriman 
was: iconoclastic, a clever sort of 
populist intellectual, devoted to his 
wife and two daughters, an ardent 
pacifist, vegetarian and animal lover. 

Herriman had a life-long fascination 
with native American culture. Native 
American pottery shows up contin-
ually in Krazy Kat, often balanced 
precariously on the roofs and chimneys 
of buildings. 

Sometimes Navajo 
logograms are incorporated into the 
frames of the strip, either painted on 
furniture or formed in the foliage of a 
topiary tree. Herriman's appreciation 
of Navajo culture and his sensitivity 
towards the Indians' 
position in 
depression America earned him the 
respect of the residents of Kayente, 
Arizona who presented him with a 
blanket with his name woven into it. 
Their region later became the basis for 
the Coconino County setting of Krazy. 

Monument Valley is an amazing 
place, an alien landscape of desert, 
mesa and limestone formations of 
strange and unexpected shapes. The 
Mittens, the Rainbow Bridge, the 
Thunder Needle-all appear in the 
background of Krazy Kat cartoons, and 
all seem as if they were products of 
Herriman's imagination until one sees 
the photographs of them provided by 
the editors. 

If there is a profundity in Krazy Kat, 
it is probably in the settings. They are 
the keys to the personalities of the 
characters and their creator, both in 
the simple sense that they show his love 
for Arizona, and in the sense that, like 
surrealist landscapes, 
they act as 
representations of our subconscious 
visions. 

Certainly Herriman's Coconino is 
not the same place as the reservation in 
Arizona- his scenery is too fluid and 
the climate and geography too 
transitory. Topography, time of day 
and situation change abruptly from 
frame to consecutive frame in Krazy 
Kat. One daily strip, for example, 
shows the characters against a distant 
butte in the first picture, on a darkened 
plain for the second frame, in front of a 
tree for the third picture, and near a 
limestone mound for 
the fourth. 

Sometimes the moon crashes into the 
desert or a distant sea as it sets, kicking 
up a cloud of dust or foam in the 
process. Day changes to night if a 
character is sad. 

But what Krazy Kat mostly is, is 
funny. Very, very funny. Although 
many of the strips end with punch-
lines, and thus share the stru~ture of 
spoken gags, most by far rely on 
stories, drawings, and situations that 
are intrinsically hilarious. Every panel 
is wonderfully funny on its own, 
because every picture has its autono-
mous charge of humor. You do not 
have to know the story or characters of 
Krazy Kat to smile at a frame in which a 
scowling, scruffy, stick-armed mouse 
heaves a brick onto the head of a 
google-eyed, kinky-tailed, starch-
collared cat. As it rapidly approaches 
the horizontal, 
the cat exclaims 
joyfully: "li'l mornings glora -there 
him is-and I'm a heppy, heppy ket." 

The rational parts of our minds 
scream: what the heck is going on 
here? That a mouse would biff a cat 
with a brick seems reasonable, given 
the historical enmity of the two species, 
or at least reasonable within the 
bounds of comic strip rationality. But 
why is the cat so happy about it? Why 
does it speak with such an eccentric 
accent? And what about the scraggly 
pine tree on the horizon in back of 
them- is it preternaturally huge, thus 
dwarfing the house that nestles near its 
trunk, or is it a tiny house, and a 
regulation-sized tree? 

All 
dislocated reality that grounds humor 
is 
present here- no matter how 
familiar we become with Krazy Kat, the 
many layers of absurdity inherent in its 
basic concept persist. 

Another central aspect of Krazy Kat 
is its sensuous celebration of the funny 
sounds of English- a quality of most 
comic discourse which often goes un-
noticed, because of its usual transpar-
ancy. Each of the Coconino characters 
has a distinct way of speakjng. Of these, 
Krazy's is the most 
r~markableÂ­
Seldes accurately described it as "partly 
Dickens and partly Yiddish, and the 
rest is not to be identified, for it is 
Krazy." Joe Storck, a 
mystical 
secondary character, lectures Krazy on 
spritualism; 
his sentence: "yovr 
'ectoplasm' 
passes out of your 
body-and soars out into the limitless 
ether, to roam willy-nilly, unleashed 
and unbound," is remembered by 
Krazy later: "Just imegine having your 
'ectospasm' running around William
