To get a taxi permit, 
new ideas, good 
equipment, and 
adequate insurance 
are not enough.

Richard Spear leans forward and 
thumps the table. "If I don't get my 
three permits this time," he says, 
jabbing the air with his finger, "I'm 
going to hire a fancy New York lawyer, 
an antitrust lawyer, even if I have to 
spend my last penny. I'll sue the

weekly lease but own and maintain 
their own cars. Although Metro Taxi 
provides dispatching, its drivers must 
compete against one another for the 
most lucrative calls while ignoring 
other customers. According to Spear, 
smaller operations could improve 
public service 
without 
directly 
comP.eting with Metro Taxi. "I'll stop

reluctance, will approve any of ,he new 
applications. 
To get a taxi permit, new ideas, 
good equipment, and adequate in-
surance are not enough. Applicants 
must establish at a D.O.T. hearing 
"the public need and convenience" 
served by their intended enterprise, 
their own business competence, and 
the 
financial 
plausibility of their 
proposal. Why make the application 
process so involved? "Entry to the 
market should be limited," John Riley 
of the D.O.T. explains, "so that those 
who hold authority, if they're per-
forming satisfactorily, should have a 
viable 
operation." 
Public Transit 
R egulatory Supervisor Robert 
Cumpstone agrees. "If tlw authori-
zation of new 
opt> rat ions 
would 
displace adequate-" he pauses, "or 
fairly adequate-service, we would 
seriously reconsider the consequences 
o f issuing that authority." Both men 
believe that the D.O.T. has an obli-
gation to protect the market for 
authorized carriers. "It's in the interest 
of public service and of public safety," 
Riley says, pointing out that a taxicab 
company is bound by license to pro-
vide a public service 24 hours a day, 
seven days a week. Metro Taxi serves 
nearly 700,000 people each year. 
Before the D.O.T. makes a 
new 
authorization, it must consider how 
that action 
might jeopardize 
market. R iley warns that any com-
promises may result 
in unstable 
finances, marginal service, and the 
concomitant hazards of speeding 
drivers, ~ n safe cars, and rate abuses . 
• !; 
A hearing determines what con-
stitutes damage 
to 
market. 
Cumpstone estimates a healthy margin 
of earnings to be 15 cents on every 
dollar. A drop to ten cents on every 
dollar due to competition, he admits, 
would not be tragic. Cumpstone main-
tains that the D.O.T. would be more 
likely to issue permits "if existing 
service is Jess than the public would 
expect." 
"I'd like to take Bob Cumpstone to 
the train station on a Friday night," 
Gerry Walthall says, tapping a pile of 
papers. 
Walthall owns Heritage 
Livery, a Branford-based limousine 
service. Last March he applied for ten 
New Haven permits, but unlike Spear, 
he is not an authorized carrier in the 
city so he faces tougher pr;ospects. 
Walthall thinks that New Haven's taxi 
problems are endemic to Metro's 
"archaic" organization. He leans over 
to search his briefcase 
for more 
evidence, 
setzmg brochures about 
cellular telephones, stock ownership 
programs, and English limousines. 
Walthall feels persecuted. The D.O.T. 
has indicted him for servicing New 
Haven without a permit. Given the 
chance, he feels he can solve the taxi 
problem. All that stops him, he claims, 
stacking his brochures, is the D.O.T. 
Doug Vine, owner of Branford Cab, 
says that on rainy days he gets nearly 
15 calls an hour from New Haven. "I 
have to turn them away," he says. Vine 
has applied for five New H aven vehicle 
permits. Meanwhile he refers his New 
H aven calls to Spear. "The D .O.T . 
has been neglectful of the public need 
X I 
and convenit·nn·." Spear ""Y"· "Ev<'ry 
night, I'm the only cab at the tram 
station lot· the II :08, and the I :OR. and 
the 2:23, and the 3:37. It's so had 
that gypsy cabs are coming in." Gypsy 
cabs are uninsured, unauthorized cars. 
"Someone in the D.O.T. is harboring 
the monopoly. Why else would they 
deny the public of New Haven the 
service it needs?" Riley counters that 
the D.O. T. does not deny the public 
anything. The D.O. T. does not have 
the resou rces to ensure adequate 
service from permit holders across the 
state, 
but 
it 
does 
investigate 
complaints. 
The independents 
believe 
D.O.T. takes "public interest" to mean 
"monopoly." Historically, the D.O.T. 
has had a no-win situation in New 
Haven. In 1979 Yellow Cab, with only 
eight cars on the road, went bankrupt. 
T he D.O.T. refused permits to appli-
cants it judged to be insufficiently 
experienced and financed; instead, it 
allowed Yellow Cab to come out of 
bankruptcy under new ownership. The 
D.O.T. sought to safeguard public 
service. It feared that any attempts it 
made to introduce a long-range solu-
tion through other carriers would 
result in crisis if they failed. Riley 
accepts that Yellow Cab's service was 
not adequate, but no competitor had 
the means to step in and take over their 
volume of business. Cumpstone argues 
that the decision to rescue Yellow Cab, 
although 
"a spotty proposition," 
allowed New Haven five years of rela-
tive stability and "fairly adequate, 
while not tremendous, service."

As long as Metro Taxi owns almost all the taxi permits in New Haven, 
others must wait to take the driver's seat. 
After Yellow Cab reorganized, the 
company remained in bad shape. Joe 
McFarland, owner of Yellow Cab, 
successfully opposed any new author· 
izations. 
Spear 
recalls 
a 
D.O.T. 
hearing for Branford Cab in August of 
1986 in which McFarland testified that 
Yellow Cab earned only $50,000 after 
taxes and that the introductiqn of even 
one more permit in New Haven would 
bankrupt him. The D.O.T. allowed no 
independent carrier to start in New 
Haven on the grounds that before it 
developed 
resources 
and 
market to compete, Yellow Cab would 
collapse, leaving the 
city with 
insufficient service. 
The D.O.T. continues to assume 
that by guaranteeing the market for 
the city's largest permit holder, it 
protects the public interest. Metro 
Taxi enjoys almost exclusive rights to 
Hamden, Woodbridge, New Haven, 
and North, East, and West Haven. 
But Yellow Cab failed under sim;Jar 
circumstances. With many of Yellow 
Cab's problems in organization and 
work force, Metro Taxi could also fail 
to supply adequate service and decent 
work conditions, especially if the 
D.O.T. shuts out competition. But the 
D.O.T. protects markets for author-
ized carriers less as a 
matter of 
principle than of expediency. In New 
Haven, change is risky. The D.O.T. 
does not concern itself with the small 
operators who feel slighted. "What 
about my business, my benefit?" Spear 
asks. "I'm a proven operator. I'm 
authorized. And I need these new cabs 
to protect my own business." 
The independents believe that the 
D.O.T. needs a firsthand look at New 
Haven. In the past, the D.O.T. has 
missed overt signs of a failing system 
because of its distance. For example, 
Yellow Cab had only 18 cars running 
on its last day of service. None of the 
drivers or dispatchers knew Metro 
Taxi would take over the next day. 
However, according to D. 0. T. re· 
cords, Yellow Cab had 70 registered 
vehicles, 
which 
Cumpstone says, 
"could have 
been 
physically 
mobilized." The D.O.T. can revoke 
permits for unregistered, unopera· 
tiona) vehicles, 
but only after a 
complaint has been filed and three 
years have passed. Riley comments 
that even during the last days of Yellow 
Cab, "surprisingly" few complaints 
reached the D.O.T. in Wethersfield. 
Spear accuses Riley of suppressing 
hundreds of letters. "None of those 
guys live in New Haven," Spear 
argues. "I know New Haven. They've 
hardly even seen it." 
Riley explains that the D.O.T. 
recognizes the problems caused by its 
isolation from New Haven and has 
taken steps toward a remedy. It plans 
to hold a joint public hearing in New 
Haven by late March. Spear, Walt· 
hall, and Vine have filed for 18 new 
taxi 
permits among them. 
The 
attorney general's office confirmed the 
legality of a joint hearing two weeks 
ago. Riley claims it will take less than a 
month to organize. 
The D.O.T. decided to hold the 
hearing in New Haven to get public 
input and to end complaints about the 
Wethersfield location. "We'll see how
