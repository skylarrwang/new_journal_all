The Primary Ambition of 
Irwin Zucker 
Irwin Zucker got 22 votes for President 
in the New Hampshire Democratic 
primary. On the surface, that makes 
him different from you and me. It also 
makes him different from Michael 
Dukakis, who garnered over 43,350 
votes. Both men are still in the race. 
Perhaps 22 votes mean more than we 
think. 

I never wanted to be President, 
though politics has always interested 
me. My dream was to be Ace Political 
Reporter, dodging through crowds on 
the campaign trail to confront Senator 
Chauncey Shmcndritk about his stand 
on arms sall''l to Southwest Northern 
Eastland. Dreams can fade, though, or 
be .recognized as dreams, and Ace 
Political Reporter soon ended up in my 
closet next to Major Leaguer and 
Woody Allen. Middle school and high

school passed, but I felt no closer to 
politics than I had in sixth grade when 
I patched together a recap of Election 
Night 1980 from the New York Times. 
Indeed, as I became a voter, ostensibly 
entering the political process, I none-
theless felt as distant from it as I had 
working for my elementary school 
M cDivitt Mustang. 
In college, 
my frustration with 
politics has arisen from something 
more basic than a sense of anonymity 
among millions of voters or of the 
invisibility of "politicians" hundreds of 
miles away. Politics- and especially 
Presidential politics- is compelling, 
daunting, seductive, but its essence 
escap~s me. The dictionary definition 
of "politics, noun" does not hint at its 
force. Does politics equal govern'ment? 
Is it the means of entering into a
Politics- and 
especially Presidential 
politics- is compel-
ling, daunting, 
seductive, but its 
essence escapes me. 


Government? Or is it some large 
process upon 
which government 
depends, but which remains free of 
government? Politics seemed to lie 
behind a glass, visible but not tangible. 
To understand, I needed to pass into 
that world beyond. 

Covering a campaign would admit 
me, I had thought, to the World of 
Politics. In my sixth-grade vision I 
would crawl under the other reporters' 
legs, jump up in front, and ask my 
questions. Now I know I would be 
stuck in the back. Bored, I would 
wander over to the complimentary 
doughnuts, then turn around to dis-
cover the press bus traveling at the 
speed of light for the next city. 

Welcome, 
Matt, to the 
Political 
Wilderness that lies outside the World 
of Politics. Here, politicians are not 
programmed, and politics is not an 
assumption, 
but another form of 
human action to be questioned. 

"[Thirty-nine] Aspirants File for 
New Hampshire Primary," the Times 
announced in late December. Some 
were familiar figures from the World 
of Politics, but who were the outsiders 
that had plunked down SIOOO apiece to 
access the ballot? According to the 
Times, one was a chemistry professor, 
another a grocery store clerk, and a 
third was the former leader of the Ku 
Klux Klan. Who, though, was "Irwin 
Zucker, 55, of Eatontown, N.J .," 
living only half an hour from my 
home? What did politics mean to him? 

"The time is at hand when the wear-
ing of prayer shawl and skullcap will 
not bar a man from the White House," 
Wallace Markfield wrote in You Could 
Live If Th9 Let You, "unless, of course, 
the man is Jewish." This sort of senti-
ment, I figured, had sparked an Irwin 
Zucker to enter the race for the Presi-
dency. He lived in Eatontown, which, 
while not affiuent 
itself, 
adjoins 
wealthy Jewish communities in Deal 
and other shore towns. I tried to con-
tact him, but he had an unlisted 
number. Both Eatontown and Mon-
mouth County 
officials 
professed 
ignorance of him, and neither the 
Chamber of Commerce nor the local 
Jewish Community Center were help-
ful. His elusiveness only enriched my 
conception of an aloof individual 
driven by private motives. I thought it 
possible that by the age of 55 one could 
have collected both intense bitterness 
toward politics and enough money to 
express it. A man with an unlisted 
number-to my mind one of the silliest 
of conceits-would willingly spend 
$1000 for no other reason than to 
soothe his ego or to register a protest 
against the political process. 

But this was not Irwin Zucker. The 
address I acquired through a call to the 
New Hampshire secretary of state led 
to a shabby real estate office in a 
parking lot facing a McDonald's-a 
modern-day log cabin amidst suburb-
ia. My knock brought no response. 
Unsure, I noticed a red, white, and 
blue sticker on the mailbox that read 
"Irwin Zucker/Restore Respect." 1 left 
a note. 

We met a couple of days later in the 
McDonald's. Zucker reached across a 
table strewn with papers to shake my 
hand. Broad-shouldcn•d

slightly of Walter Mondale. Upon 
seeing my tape recorder, he suggested 
that we move to his home, which was 
quieter. As we crossed the parking lot, 
Zucker explained that he had spent the 
last several days in Brooklyn con-
sulting with his public relations man, 
auending to campaign literature. Now 
he was thinking through his strategy 
for New Hampshire. Zucker eschewed 
the common shake-hands-and-smile 
approach, asserting that the people of 
New Hampshire were jaded by the 
fawning of the major candidates. He 
wanted to speak at the "nine or ten 
academic colleges in New Hampshire." 
H e thought this reOected his rational 
approach to politics and seemed more 
likely to gain him media attention. 

From the start, I saw that Zucker's 
view of the media was battling his de-
votion to the housing crisis, his focus 
issue. Early in his more than two weeks 
of campaigning in New Hampshire, 
Zucker wrote a press release indicting 
the press itself, claiming it was "more 
interested in what is going on in bed-
rooms than in building them." Though 
disgusted with the "Peeping Tom" me-
dia, Zucker sleeps with the book How 
lo Get Free Press beside his bed. A 
serious candidate- as Zucker, in his 
blazer and tie, 
surely considered 
himself- had to be ready for the media 
when it came. He began our conversa-
tion by complimenting my neat hand-
writing, as he had already done in his 
phone call to arrange our meeting, and 
he seemed impressed by my tape re· 
corder and briefcase. Perhaps if I were 
truly "the media," that meant, in his 
mind, a concomitant elevation of 
himself to media figure. Though the 
press seemed shallow when viewed 
from the Political Wilderness, Zucker 
nevertheless found it difficult not to 
adopt the postures of the World of 
Politics. 

Zucker handed me his campaign li-
terature: 
several 
position 
papers, 
clippings about the ballot in New 
Hampshire, relics from his campaigns 
of the past, and a biography. I began 
by asking him about his background. 
After stressing that he preferred to 
conce"ntrate on the housing problem, 
Zucker spoke candidly about his life-
style and past. Then again, it would 
have been hard to conceal anything 
from me. We were talking in his bed-
room. 

I have never been in another can-

didate's bedroom or house, but I 
suspect that they in no way resemble 
Zucker's. Senator AI Gore probably 
does not have a pile of clothes lying on 
the floor in his front room, amid scat-
tered papers, 
magazines, 
and 
Domino's Pizza boxes. The front room 
had no heat, and we held our con-
versation in his bedroom in the back. 
He sat on his bed, his wardrobe 
dangling from a rod overhead, and I 
sat on a chair across from him. Zucker 
had moved to New Jersey only a year 
and a half earlier. Previously he lived 
in Brooklyn, where he ran a newspaper 
home delivery service for two decades. 
Financial problems precipitated the 
move. 

, , 
"I have been interested in politics 
since I was ten years old," Zucker 
proudly told me. Beginning in 1970, 
he vied for a number of offices, inclu-
ding positions on a local school board, 
on the New York C ity Council, and on 
the New York State Assembly and 
Senate. He has yet to win one. This 
record he attributes to a lack of money. 
Nevertheless, Zucker refuses to accept 
contributions larger than $100, fearing 
they would lead him to become "a 
governmental prostitute." Zucker 
supports his candidacy almost entirely 
by jobs he takes when not concen-
trating solely on his campaign. He was 
employed most recently by Domino's 
Pizza. 

Zucker speaks proudly of his "hum-
ble background"-as he noted, like 
Dukakis he is of immigrant par-
entage- but believes that his strength 
as a candidate eclipses it. He sees 
himself as the "earthiest candidate 
since Harry S Truman." In one of his 
position papers, Zucker describes his 
common-sense approach and appeal to 
the mind as transcending Senator Paul 
Simon's "cater[ing] to the sensibilities 
(the emotions)." Zucker is not about to 
foster an image for the World of Poli· 
tics that downplays his thinking. 

Zucker considers himself a prag-
matic intellectual. He believes that his 
solutions to the problems "of our coun· 
try validate his candidacy, despite his 
lack of experience in public ·office.
