Street Talk 
Since I left childhood, 
the remarks, leers, 
and gestures have 
become part of my 
definition of walking 
outside. 

After midnight on a Wednesday night, 
I am returning a borrowed computer 
disk to a friend. I cannot hear the 
groups of students a few blocks away, 
but I know they are there, passing 
through Cross Campus or talking 
outside Naples pizzeria. A man ap-

direction I suspect is correct but 
question my accuracy. New Haven 
streets are made up of buildings to me, 
not names. Curly, light-brown hair, 
maybe blond. I feel guilty about my 
brusque response, 
wanting to be 
friendly or at least polite. "Can I ask 
you another question?" he persists. He 
starts across the street towards me. On 
drugs? I don't know. Definitely not a 
student. His face doesn't alarm me. 
But his words do. "Would you watch 
me jack off?" His hand reaches for his 
zipper. 

I quickly turn the corner, glancing
