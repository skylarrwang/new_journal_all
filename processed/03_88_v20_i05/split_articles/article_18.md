Overdue Notice 
Julie Hantman 
A student dining hall worker leans 
against a wet counter to pull in another 
tray. This one is loaded with a plate of 
grayish beef bourgignon, wadded nap-
kms. oranQ;e peels, and three Rlasses 
used as ashtrays. Meanwhile, behind 
the serving line, another student worker 
scoops peas on10 a plate and fields 
complaints about the food. 
Not even eight dollars an hour can 
convince some students to work in the 
dining halls. Those on financial aid, 
paying rent, or in need of spending 
money look to a number of other cam-
pus jobs. Over 350 undergraduates 
and graduates have chosen Yale's 
library system, the University's largest 
student employer. Flexible working 
hours, the chance to get schoolwork 
done at a desk position, and even the 
opportunity to learn about library 
science attract 
students. 
Although 
some tasks are tedious, there are no 
chicken bones. 
In exchange for these conveniences, 
student library workers forego the 
protection of a union. Student dining 
hall workers have been part of Local 
35- the maintenance and dining hall 
workers' union-since 
1977. The 
union ensured that students' hours 
would not be cut from one semester to 
the next and that a year's leave of 
absence would not affect their pay. In 
the most recent contract with Yale, 
26 The New Journal/March 4. 1988 
students won paid time to change into 
uniform and first crack at summer 
custodial jobs. Their minimum wage 
jumped from $6.71 to $7.88. Student 
dining hall workers also enjoy the 
protection of job descriptions and 
grievance procedures. 
Student library workers, however, 
are barred from Local 34, the clerical 
and technical worker's union, formed 
in 1984. Organizing full-time workers 
alone 
took 
five 
years of intense 
struggle. Michael Boyle, Local 34 
union organizer, explains that students 
were not included in the organizing 
drive in order to expedite the process. 
"There was a desire to get the union 
election quickly. A common manage-
ment strategy is to stall, especially over 
who's in and who's not. We didn't 
stalL" Since then, the union has had 
little time or inclination to organize 
student library workers. Constituting 
half of the library staff, students could 
augment union strength. But every 
four years, a generation of students 
comes and goes. The difficulty in 
unionizing transient workers and the 
fear that students' concerns would skew 
the permanent workers' goals also ex-
plain their exclusion. 
T hese students now face the ad-
m m lstration 
alone. 
In 
1985, 
a 
committee headed by the director of 
studen t 
employment standardized 
student jobs. Up to this point, there 
were myriad student job titles, cor-
responding to various wages. The 
committee found enough similarities 
among student jobs to channel them 
into three levels, setting wages between 
$4.85 and $6.00, and allowing for a 
yearly raise of 15 cents. But the com-
mittee neither provided a written 
description of these three levels, nor 
indicated how much they pay. 
With no guidelines, the library's 
personnel office interpreted the 
standardization 
for 
itself. 
Before 
standardization, there were about 20 
diffe~ ~nt student library jobs. Ac-
cording to Maureen Sullivan, director 
of Library Personnel, "We had some 
students who were being paid more 
than other studen ts doing the same 
level of work." The majority of the jobs 
paid between $4.65 and $5.23. These 
were channeled into Level One, at the 
new minimum of $4.85. "This was our 
effort to bring things all together with 
fewer titles and to assure that we were 
paying the students fairly," Sullivan 
says. But although the wages of some 
positions rose, most fell. To prevent 
individual workers from suffering a 
decrease, the library established a 
grandfather clause, maintaining wages 
for students· who had been earning 
more than $4.85. 
Though the administration at-
tempted to be fair by instituting the 
grandfather clause, some students feel 
that it has actually contributed to the 
injustice. One night in September, 
Mark Harmon (GRD '91) was work-
ing behind the desk at Kline Science 
Library. While chatting, he discovered 
that his co-worker earned 38 cents 
more per hour for doing the same 
work. Outraged, he filed a grievance 
through the Provost Procedure for 
Student Complaints. 
But Provost 
William Nordhaus rejected it, ex-
plaining that student wage levels are 
administrative decisions and 
not 
subject to review through student 
complaint procedures. 
In addition to unstable wages and no 
grievance procedures, student library 
workers have no sound job d.escrip-
tions.

(CCL), Level One students are meant 
to perform circulation duties under 
direct supervision. There is no written 
job description for Level Two. Accord-
ing to Sue Crockford-Peters, acting 
department head of CCL, Level Two 
workers should divide 
their time 
between lead duty- supervising other 
students-and computer work. Crock-
ford-Peters says, "We know which 
responsibilities fall into which 
categories." 
But Lynn Festa's (SM '90) exper-
ience shows that the categories are not 
•SO clear. Last semester. she worked as 
a "lead" two nights a week, at Level One 
pay. Only one worker on a shift re-
ceives Level Two pay. A lead super-
vises all students on a shift, however, 
including those at Level Two, and 
often even 
clerical 
and 
technical 
workers (C&T's). The library admini-
stration seems 
recognize 
the 
increased 
responsibility 
by 
calling 
students "leads," but does not · raise 
them to Level Two pay of $5.50 per 
hour. 
Students' increased 
role as 
supervisors reflects the library system's 
difficulty in attracting full-time 
employees. Library jobs for these 
workers are among the lowest paying 
jobs on campus. According to the 
1 f union steward at Sterling, 
Lynn 
Catalano, the root problem is that 
"the library 
is 
basically 
cheap." 
Jeff Campbell (PC '88) would agree. 
Last semester, he worked full time at 
CCL: He spent most of his time filling 
the vacant nighttime supervisor posi-
tion, which normally pays $10.00 per 
hour, but for which he earned $6.00. 
During the rest of his time he pro-
cessed course lists. Campbell estimates 
he accrued 70 to 80 hours in overtime. 
To date he has not received the $200 
owed him. In fact, no student who has 
worked over 40 hours has received the 
overtime legally due them. "The ra-
tionale is that they can always hire 
more students," Campbell says. "But 
there is only a handful of students who 
are trained to do these things. Then 
they say the budget is too tight and 
pretend as if the students are not worth 
the overtime." Although working with 
six C&T's, Campbell processed over 
40 percent of last semester's 500 
reserve course lists. 
Students at CCL are responsible for 
a great deal of the work. Some claim 
that they easily exceed the required 
rate of shelving- one truckload of 
books per hour- while many of their 
C&T co-workers shelve below this 
rate. Part of the problem seems un-
solvable; students working short shifts 
at a boring job will compensate by 
working faster. Sullivan recognizes this 
dilemma. "Most of the students who 
work in the library are hard workers. I 
think it's 
probably part of their 
nature." But their attention is not so 
focused on the stacks that they do not 
notice if a higher-paid C&T beside 
them is shelving half a truck per hour. 
Rob Coleman (DC '89) says, "You feel 
stupid for working harder than people 
who make more than you do." Many 
students start out shelving quickly but 
then slow down. "You don't get an 
extra star for shelving a truck a 
minute," one freshman says. 
In the Sterling reference depart-
ment, four students have been working 
on the Update Project to computerize 
Yale's card cataloguing system. They 
learned to use two computer data-
bases, two bibliography sources, and 
to verify bibliographic information. 
Among them, they needed to be fluent 
in three foreign languages. The stu-
dents take the project seriously, 
finding it a rewarding experience to 
work with the highly skilled reference 
librarians . 
Probably the 
most_ 
demanding and complex job in the 
library system, it pays Level One 
wages. 
Sarah 
Petit (DC '88), 
member of the Update team, says, "I 
ask myself, is it worth all the hours I 
spend there? Five dollars is just not 
adequate. 
I'm 
performing an 
invaluable service." 
For some, library wages create fi-
nancial difficulties, but most simply 
feel exploited. Lucinda Finley, asso-
ciate professor of labor law at Yale Law 
School, says, "There are few legal 
protections in the United States for 
non-unionized labor . . . Practically 
speaking, as long as the University has 
other students wanting jobs, they can 
keep job tasks the same and pay a 
lower wage." But since the fall of 1986, 
applications for student library jobs 
have dwindled. Recognizing this prob-
lem, Associate Provost Lloyd Suttle 
recently formed a committee to study 
problems at Student Employment. H e 
hopes to create a manual to explain 
what the three levels mean. As yet, 
no specific plans exist either to furnish 
job descriptions or to change the level 
system. The committee plans to review 
only the minimum wage. 
Student workers are skeptical. 
Rather than wait for the results of the 
committee, some are df'manding an 
annual 
increase in the minimum wage 
now. They have sent petitions to the 
administration and organized a work 
slowdown at CCL, shelving only as 
rapidly as they think their pay war-
rants. Feeling ignored by the admini-
stration, some see unionization as their 
only solution. But a union is no cure-
all. Many student dining hall workers 
feel like second-class citizens, ignored 
by union leaders. Though pleased with 
their high wages, they think that $17 
monthly dues are not justified. In light 
of such problems, some student library 
workers do not want 
to unionize. 
But for others, unionization may be 
the only alternative to the dishroom.
