**Spencer's Lost Love**
**Author: Jennifer Sachs**
**Page number(s): 31**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
So in the end, we leave Spencer 
where we 
found 
him, 
desolately 
contemplating his lost love. Let us 
hope he has not paid $29.95 for The 
Psychology of Love just so he can win 
J ulie's heart again. Sternberg and 
Barnes' compilation provides insight 
into some aspects of love. T he book's 
preface, however, recalls the skep-
ticism of Senator William P roxmire 
about love psychologists. "I believe 
that 200 million Americans want to 
leave some things in life a mystery . . . 
and right at the top of the list of the 
things we don't want to know is why a 
man falls in love with a woman and 
vice versa," the Senator a rgued in 
1977. Proxmire can relax- he won't 
find the answer, if one exists, in The 
Psychology of Love .
