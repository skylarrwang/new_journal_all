A 
few weeks fl'om now over the 
Aegean Sea, science and myth will 
converge in a tiny humanpowered 
aircraft called Daedalus. The aircraft is 
named for the figure in Greek. myth-
ology 
who 
with his son Icarus 
attempted to escape from the dungeon 
of King Minos. That Daedalus used 
wings of wax and feathers. The 
modern one relies on featherweight 
plastics, has a 102-foot wing span, and 
weighs only 70 pounds. Begun three 
years ago as the brainchild of a group 
of scholars at Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, the Daedalus project 
now involves the efforts of two Yale 
professors. If successful, the aircraft 
will set a new record for manpowered 
flight. 

Tracing the path of its mythical 
namesake, Daedalus will fly at about 
15 miles an hour from Heraklion, the 
capital of Crete, to the island of San 
Torini, 70 miles away. Although the 
distance is nearly twice as far as any 
other manpowered aircraft has gone, 
early tests have been encouraging. A 
year ago last January, a less stream-
lined version of Daedalus flew 37 
miles, breaking the distance record set 
by the Gossamer Albatross, which 
crossed the English Channel in 1979. 

Since the .stress of pedaling for four 
to six hours 20 feet above the ocean is 
comparable to running two mara-
thons, the Daedalus team turned to 
Ethan Nadel, 
Yale professor of 
physiology and epidemiology, to deal 
with the complexities of what Nadel 
terms "the human machine." At the 
John B. Pierce Foundation Labora-
tory, affiliated with the Yale Medical 
School, Nadel ran tests on over two 
dozen athletes who applied to pilot the 
craft. He selected five candidates, 
including 
a 
triathlete from 
University of Connecticut Medical 
School, three American cyclists, and 
the top-ranked cyclist on the Greek 
national team. 

With the assistance of second-year 
medical student Alan 
Hillibrand, 
Nadel has attended. to the needs of his 
pilots during the flight. He conducted 
tests to determine the temperature in 
the cockpit for optimum performance 
and consulted with Daedalus engineers 
in order to provide adequate venti-
lation. He also developed a fluid rich in 
carbohydrates for the pilots to drink 
during the flight. 

The team is aiming for an a~urate 
enactment of the fabled flight. ' Sarah 
Morris, associate professor of Classics 
at Yale, studied close to a dozen 
different versions of the myth before 
finally 
establishing an acceptable 
route. Morris sees the project as 
another stage in the myth's evolution; 
an account of the flight will appear in a 
book she is writing on the myth. 

Currently, the team of scholars and 
pilots are at Edwards Air Force Base in 
California for final training and flight 
preparation. The primary Daedalus 
craft suffered some damage to one 
wing and its cockpit in a minor crash 
earlier this month, but the team plans 
to travel to Crete with the replacement 
craft at the end of March. Although to 
some the project may seem like model 
building on a grand scale, Nadel firmly 
believes that it has significance beyond 
the record books. "It has research and a 
lot of students involved, the generation 
of new knowledge, and it educates the 
general public," he said. "This is what 
an academic project ought to be."
