up Wall Street to see people by Naples. 
I know that I will be safe; he won't 
follow me. I look over my shoulder and 
capitalize on my fear and anger. "Fuck 
off," I say derisively. Somehow I pull it 
off. 


For the next few days I bring the 
subject up occasionally, 
either to 
explain why I ask for an escort home or 
to get feedback from others. I also need 
to dissociate myself from his offense by 
making it public. Many times, both 
women and men responding to the 
story express confusion, shock, sur-
prise. "Why do men do that?" they ask. 
"As a man, I don't have to worry about 
being alone. I can't imagine not being 
comfortable enough to walk around." 
"That's really horrible," they say. 


Part of me wants to brush off their 
reactions. After all, such incidents 
happen every day. Although that night 
was the first time a harasser asked me 
to watch him masturbate, the harass-
ment in general joins a long list of 
offenses. The women I know have all 
been victims at some time, to ~orne 
extent. My mind provides any number 
of scenarios: day or night, 
busy 
sidewalk or isolated street, group of 
women or alone. Since I left childhood, 
~· the remarks, leers, and gestures have 
become part of my definition of walk-
ing outside. Over time, these routine 
assaults have undermined my sense of 
self-sufficiency. Each incident threat-
ens my identity as an independent 
woman, as well as my safety. 


When I leave the corner of Wall and 
Temple, I feel both numb and strange-
ly alert. Several yards ahead of me, 
someone unlocks a bike. I estimate the 
length of time before he crosses my 
path. I try to determine whether he will 
turn at the intersection and whether 
the street ahead is well-lighted. Only 
then do I notice that I am almost 
home. Once outside the residential 
college gate, I consider abandoning my 
·~ errand to seek the safety of my room. 
But in familiar territory, my fear 
seems exaggerated. 


On the street leading to my friend's 
room, a policeman observes the pas-
sers-by. I want to tell him about the 
man just a few blocks away, but I feel 
silly. Nothing has really happened to 
me, I tell myself as I walk on, but I 
thank the policeman silently for being 
there. A man stands in the passage 
between the Co-op and my friend's 
college. By this time I am tn(\ timid to 
pass, and so I wait for him to finish urin-
ating against the wall. My hesitancy 
makes me feel both prudish and vul-
nerable. The policeman starts in my 
direction, and I smile weakly. I feel as 
if I will never make it to a place with 
familiar faces. 


Given time to think about that night, I 
realized that I had underestimated its 
impact. Something significant had oc-
curred. I studied "street harassment" a 
year ago in Introduction to 
Women~ 
Studies, taught by Assistant Professor 
Micaela di Leonardo, and I remember 
feeling relieved when I read her article, 
"The Political Economy of Street 
Harassment." Right there in academic 
language someone had verified that 
harassment exists, and that it 
IS 
unwarranted. 


But my response stemmed from ha-
bit, not from anything I had learned in 
an article a year ago. Taught since 
childhood to ignore the comments, I 
had come to overlook my reactions. 
Street harassment had taken on such 
an elusive quality that I could not 
identify its effects. And consequently, 
every incident in which a man ha-
rassed 
me became a 
non-event, 
especially under less 
menacing 
circumstances. It didn't really hap-
pen, so I could not really be dis-
turbed by it. At the time, even my 
would-be exhibitionist failed to stir me 
out of that mentality, 
so that 
I 
only smiled at an on-duty police 
officer and felt embarrassed about 
bothering him. Later I recognized how 
much I had compromised my feelings. 


But di Leonardo leaves no room for 
uncertainty. Street harassment, like 
rape, 
constitutes 
violence 
against 
women. And our society trivializes it, 
as it does rape. Di Leonardo testifies to 
the event, first by defining it: 
Street harassment occurs when one 
or more strange men accost one or 
more women whom they perceive as 
heterosexual in a public place which 
is not the woman's/women's work-
site. 
Through looks, 
words, or 
gestures the man asserts his right to 
intrude on the woman's attention, 
defining her as a sexual object, and 
forcing her to interact with him. 


The key words are "intrude" and 
"force." Masquerading as 
sexual 
compliment, street harassment serves 
to rob women of their freedom. 


According to di Leonardo, our cul-
ture expects women to be friendly, 
even when men are not. Therefore, 
they have two "acceptable" reactions to 
a harasser: either to smile or to show 
fear. Both signal deference to someone 
of higher status. Since the second wave 
of the women's movement, street ha-
rassment has increased significantly as 
women require more time outside to 
conduct thc.-ir business and to take care 
of their needs. The day-to-day abuses 
they suffer provide a quick way for 
men to repossess outside territory. 


Society redefines these abuses as 
flattery. "They are flirting with you; 
can't you take a compliment?" Which 
leads into: "It must be something about 
you. What were you wearing; how did 
you walk?" Many women accept street 
harassment in its more mild forms as 
complimentary, as reflective of their 
sexual appeal. But in accepting ha-
rassment as a compliment, women also 
accept an invasion of their privacy and 
a restriction of their mobility. 


I don't want to do that. In struggling 
to find an appropriate response to 
harassment, I used to stay silent. But 
too much of women's language is si-
lence. Sometime last year, I began to 
train myself to reclaim my voice. 


When I felt safe- if there were a 
number of people around or I had an 
easy out- I started to swear back, and 
once I told the stranger to "chill." I 
usually said the first thing that entered 
my mind. However, that method has 
its drawbacks. Saying "fuck you" to a 
harasser who has couched his assault in 
sexual innuendo seems to be the wrong 
reply. That night on Temple Street 
was the first time I had managed to say 
"fuck off' instead. I considered it a 
major accomplishment. 


Swearing back appeals to me be-
cause it counters the notion of what 
"ladies" 
should say. 
Since 
street 
harassers view women as inferior, I 
want to break away from their image 
of "female" as much as possible. But it 
isn't always right to do so. Foremost, a 
woman has to consider her safety. A 
man aggressively calling names from 
his car could have a hidden weapon. 
Even a foot gunning the accelerator 
becomes life-threatening. 


In order to talk back to harassers, I 
have to believe that I am not at fault. 
Society leads women to think that they 
bear the responsibility for the cat call 
out of a car window and the "hey, 
baby" from the corner. Yet rape aware-
ness 
literature uses 
the 
phrase 
"blaming the victim" for logic like that. 
From their own, ,experience, women 
can testify that street harassment has 
little to do with their clothes. At most it 
would seem that their contribution is 
having breasts. 


Knowing where the blame lies does 
not remove my feelings of suscept-
ibility. In facing a walk outside, part of 
me welcomes the advent of the cold 
l weather and the necessary layers of 
· clothes. Once shapeless, I feel more 
l protected- reduced to a figure without 
~ contour. I realize, however, that my 
~ disguise has few real results. After all, 
g my midnight harasser found me in 
i head-to-toe bulky clothing. Although 
he can take advantage of his mask as a 
stranger, I can do little to prevent his 
attack except to remove myself from all 
public situations. But that non-solu-
tion leaves me feeling robbed. Why 
should I have to eliminate myself to be 
free from scrutiny? 


The harasser has a lesson to teach: 
Women have to watch themselves 
while in the public domain. They 
never really walk alone since someone 
else always observes them. Acknow-
ledging this invasion, I have to seek 
protection, usually from men who 
enjoy immunity to this kind of sexual 
harassment (although many perceived 
homosexuals suffer another type of 
abuse). For a woman who strives to be 
understood as self-sufficient, turning 
to a man makes me feel as- if I'm turn-
ing to Daddy to help me walk across 
the street. This solution serves to keep 
men in control and to give value to 
their biceps and not their personatities. 


Although I certainly appreciate the 
protection of my male friends, I resent 
that only they give me unhindered 
access to public space. 


I later learned that the man who had 
harassed me also harassed a friend of 
mine-on that same Wednesday night. 
Hidden in a dumpster's shadow, he 
surprised her. The words were the 
same, and she too was not touched. Yet 
the incidents left both of us shaken. We 
each had to find a way to respond, to 
assess the danger, and to understand 
the implications. It was a demand on 
our time and energy that neither of us 
wanted. The next day I decided to re-
port the harassment to the Yale police. 
I sought to counter an event that 
deserved attention: because something 
could have been worse does not mean 
it wasn't bad. The police were respon-
sive, but they encouraged me to report 
~ such a case sooner in the future. As it 
was, he got away with it.
