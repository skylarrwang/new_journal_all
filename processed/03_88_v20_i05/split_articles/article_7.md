The International Center of New 
Haven has 
run out 
of money. 
Burdened with a $10,000 deficit from 
last year, the traditional resource of 
New Haven's international student 
communities cannot raise sufficient 
funds on its own. It has turned to Yale 
for help. 

The Center, founded in 1949 as a 
gathering place and residence for 
Yale's international students, separated 
from the University 33 years ago to 
serve the greater community. It now 
provides social and academic support 
for international students in New 
Haven. 

Yale, 
which 
gives 
some 
assistance to the Center, is hesitant to 
increase its commitment, citing other 
budgetary priorities and questioning 
whether the Center is of use to Yale 
students. 

But Gretchen 
Kingsley, 
executive director of the Center, warns 
that if the current fiscal problem is not 
solved, "the community that will be 
affected the most will be the Yale 
international community." She 
estimates that of the Center's 2000 
members, over 80 percent are affiliated 
with Yale and most are in the graduate 
schools. 

From an office in two Yale-donated 
rooms on Temple Street and a house 
on Prospect Street, the Center supplies 
information on everything from travel 
to taxes, 
offers host 
family and 
language 
programs, 
and provides 
translators, interpreters, and foreig_!l-
language tutors. The house serves as a 
residence for 15 people, mostly Yale 
graduate students, and as a site for 
receptions, picnics, and discussion 
groups. Gad Barzilai, 
an Israeli 
Fulbright scholar in political science at 
Yale, has lived in the house since 
September. He values the Center as a 
forum for "debate with people from 
different countries about political and 
social issues." 

Funded by donations and a nearly 
exhausted endowment, the Center has 
accrued a deficit over the last seven 
years. According to Shah Karim (SY 
'81, GRAD '88), an economics student 
from Bangladesh and a member of the 
Center's board of directors, this year 
the Center is far from satisfying its 
$150,000 budget. He explains that 'if 
the board cannot find sufficient funds, 
it will have to mortgage the house and 
drastically 
cut 
back 
the 
Center's 
programs. 

Rad Daly (SM '49), director of 
administrative services and associate 
secretary of the University, believes 
that Yale could profit from a strong 
International Center. Last summer the 
University doubled its contribution to 
the Center from one to two dollars per 
registered person. The Graduate 
School matched 70 percent of these 
funds. Yale has reviewed other ways to 
increase its involvement in the Center, 
such as augmenting its donations or 
buying the house. 

But, 
as 
Daly 
explains, 
University 
has 
not 
arrived at a decision for two reasons: 
its engagement in labor and Teaching 
Assistant negotiations and its 
reservations about the Center's use. 

While Daly concedes that it is difficult 
to figure out a formula for the human 
services that the Center provides, he 
doubts that the students themselves use 
it. "As I see it, it takes care of spouses 
and children," he says. 

George Andreopoulos, a political 
science post-doctoral research fellow 
from Greece and a resident at the 
International Center, believes that 
Daly is poorly informed. He faults 
both the administration's insufficient 
interest in the Center and the Center's 
lack of publicity for Daly's mis-
conception. 

In an effort to make the community, 
and Yale in particular, more aware 
and supportive of its programs, the 
Center has organized a spring fund-
raising campaign. It held a 
benefi~ 
concert with the Berkeley Chamber 
Orchestra last week and has scheduled 
a bazaar and several international 
meals for the coming months.
