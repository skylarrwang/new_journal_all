In New Haven, 
change is risky. T he 
D .O.T. does not 
concern itself with the 
small operators . 
many cars Metro's got on the road that 
day," Cumpstonc says. Ir the D.O.T. 
is to change New Haven's cab service, 
he stresses that the public testimony 
solicited at the hearing has to be 
convincing. "We've got to get these 
guys to see what's going on here," 
Spear says. 

T he 
hearing might bring the 
D.O.T. closer to the needs of the New 
Haven public, but only temporarily. It 
cannot sustain that contact. While the 
D.O.T. approves the equipment of all 
carriers, the Motor Vehicle Bureau 
must inspect it every six months. The 
lack of supervision makes for some 
disturbing stories. Last July, a foreign 
summer student paid S70 to get from 
Connecticut Limo to Silliman College. 
Some of the independents tell of the 
difficulty of driving the inspected 
vehicles when they were employees of 
Yellow Cab. "Yellow's cars were in 
deplorable condition," Woods says. He 
recalls never being able to find a cab 
with seat belts. Walthall remembers 
one day when every one of the five cars 
he drove broke down. On one occa-
sion, Vine pulled into the depot and 
floored the brakes. A tire fell ofT the 
cab. "I walked out of there that day," 
he says, "and never went back. Never 
in my four years there did I see an 
inspector come look at the cars." Riley 
shrugs ofT the problem. "The Motor 
Vehicle Bureau is supposed to inspect 
every six months. But they never do. 
They simply don't have the personnel, 
12 or 14 inspectors, I think, for all th<.· 
taxis, buses, and livery cars in the stall'. 
In comparison to Yellow Cab, 
Woods observes, "Metro seems to 
glitter." Metro Taxi's failings, as well 
as its successes, have an important 
bearing on the March hearing. Metro 
has increased its fleet to 70 cars. The 
expansion of one authorized carrier 
and the arrival of two new ones would 
therefore not endanger its position. 
Still, says Riley, if the authorized 
carriers in a region can show that new 
operations "demonstrably affect their 
own interests and can testify as to their 
vehicle earnings, we have to listen." If 
the service in New Haven proves in-
adequate 
for 
the 
public's 
needs, 
however, the hearing could be a 
watershed. Many of the independents, 
Walthall 
and Wood s 
particularly, 
believe that Metro Taxi's service is 
poor 
and that its organization 
guarantees a repeat of the Yellow Cab 
nightmare. 

Metro drivers pay a weekly lease for 
administrative services-a meter, a 
permit, and dispatching. Since the 
drivers are independent subcontractors 
and own their own cars, Metro does 
not worry about insurance, worker's 
11 
compensation, accident liability, or 
maintenance. "Metro has put more 
good cabs on the road this way, and I 
respect that," Vine says. "But that's 
about all, and it won't last. Already I'm 
seeing broken 
1 windows covered with 
tape and dented fenders. Almost all the 
people are the same, too-drivers, 
dispatchers, all from Yellow Cab." The 
advantage of the weekly lease, Walt-
hall explains, is that "it cleans out those 
guys who can't hold on to money long 
enough to pay at the end of a week." It 
can, 
however , 
put an 
excessive 
financial strain on the driverS- When 
Metro Taxi's radio broke down over a 
weekend, drivers had no effective 
dispatching. Meeting the lease at 
week's end became a serious problem 
for many. Fourteen-hour shifts are 
" 
common; drivers no longer get the 
limited benefits they had when they 
were unionized under Yellow Cab. 
Vine is not surprised that Metro Taxi 
drivers are "dropping leases like 
crazy." On top of the cost of gas, 
maintenance, and lease, they make a 
$75 payment toward car ownership. 
"They're paying 18 percent interest on 
their cars," Walthall says. "Most of 
them don't have the credit to get a 
better deal." 

Woods and Walthall single out the 
dispatch 
system 
as Metro Taxi's 
biggest problem. Drivers hear each 
other's dispatches. With no incentive to 
take a call or to complete the one they 
have taken, they race one another to r 
the attractive jobs and ignore the 
others. 
Walthall details 
how dis· 
patchers fabricate "dead" calls to divert 
new drivers and position their .friends 
near lucrative 
p ick-ups. 
Woods' 
solution d raws from proven systems. 
"The police use a professional dispatch 
system," Woods says. "You shouldn't 
have some d river who's lost his license 
in that dispatch seat. You should get 
someone who doesn't know the cab-
bies." Both men think that private, 
dependable d ispatches could be made 
over a system of cellular telephones. 
Cen tralized radio dispatch, waiting 
lists, and other innovations adapted 
fro m the livery business could smooth 
operations. 

W oods' own success story demon-
strates how within certain limits the 
D .O.T.'s system can work. Three 
years ago, Woods applied for and 
received three New ·H aven permits for 
C a rolyn's Checker Cab. The company 
provides a different kind of service: 
dependable, quick, and by appoint-
ment only. Woods showed that his 
alternative did not directly compete 
with Yellow Cab, and he overcame the 
difficulty of proving that he would 
serve the public need and convenience. 
In his hearing, the D.O.T. accepted 
the testimon y of a New H aven woman 
who relied on taxis to transport her to 
and from the hospital for therapy. H er 
portable oxygen supply could sustain 
, 
4 
her for two hours. She argued that she 
could not continue to stake her life on 
Yellow Cab's reliability. 

The u pcoming hearing will deter-
mine whether th ree small carriers can 
gain significant access to the New 
Haven market, but a real break-
through seems unlikely. Cumpstone 
says that if New Haven can support 
two major carriers, as do H artford and 
New London, in theory the D .O.T. 
has no reason to protect Metro Taxi. 
Opportunities in New Haven, how-
ever, are limited. "I can't see anything 
more than four or five permits getting 
by without quite a bit of justification," 
Riley says. Spear sees that limit 
working against the public interest. 
"With a little bit of competition, Metro 
m ight clean up its act."
