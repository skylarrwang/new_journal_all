at the other candidates, Zucker sees 
that "they want to be President to 
satisfy their own ego requirements. If 
you don't even address the housing 
problem- I see them addressing every-
thing else, 
but not 
the housing 
problem- I don't see why you should 
present yourself to the American 
people as a candidate for P resident." 
Zucker is an ardent supporter of free 
enterprise. However, he implores us 
not to ignore the ills of our system, and 
explains that "our slums are worse than 
ever, poverty still affiicts us, [and) 
unemployment haunts us." Zucker 
feels that our housing policy can 
address these problems. Every Ameri-
can, he contends, is allected by the 
housing industry. He has encapsulated 
the situation in what he calls the 
"R iddle of the Sphynx (sic] of Our 
Time": 
Why is it that in the face of the 
enormous and increasingly acceler-
ating technological advances that we 
are heir to, that America's newly-
weds, with both wife and husband 
working, 
find it 
increasingly 
perplexing to realize home 
ownership? 

Zucker responds to this problem in 
part in his "Three Dimensional In-
Depth Statement On D isarmament." 
H e proposes to remove housing from 
public funding, leaving it to the free-
enterprise system. By switching the 
base of property tax from building to 
land, Zucker expects to stimulate a 
building 
boom 
that 
will 
produce 
housing affordable 
to 
the 
poor. 
T hrough this shift in our lives, Zucker 
feels, we can work towards a domestic 
peace that we can then expand to peace 
among nations. In this way we will 
"Restore Respect and dignity to all, 
and to every facet of human endeavor 
and enterprise in our world." 

Zucker has a solid faith in politics, 
but in a different sort than I know. He 
compares current politics to the ideals 
of Estes Kefauver and the cult of inte-
gr~ty. "There has been a diminution of 
respect in our society," Zucker as-
serts. "Basically, I hold the politicians 
responsible for that . . .. They are the 
examples of our society. In fact, Justice 
Brandeis once made that point in a 
dissenting opinion, that, for good or 
evil, our politicians set the example for 
our society. I pick up the paper one 
day and a 
Republican is stealing 
money, the next day a Democrat is 
stealing money. This has permeated 
our society," he said. Zucker points his 
finger at all who betray the public 
trust. Not only docs he call Senator 
Joseph Biden a "delinquent rogue," but 
he decries Robert Dole and all other 
Sl·nators, 
who 
h<· 
ft·ds 
faikd 
discipline Biden properly. 

Politicians, Zucker says, must "per-
form their duty and act in accord with 
the interests of the nation." Thus, he 
sharply criticizes Gore, Simon, and 
others who attend to their electoral 
needs, instead of to the needs of the 
country. Zucker puts his desire to be 
President in perspective: "Maybe this 
is something I want, I want to be 
President, but there are 240 million 
other Americans, what do they care 
about me being President, except that 
I have something that will be helpful to 
them." 

In a phone conversation after the 
primary, Zucker labeled his results a 
"poor showing." He was not dis-
heartened, at least not enough to 
prevent him from leaving for South 
Dakota to campaign for five days be-
fore its caucus. Yes, he told me, his 
financial situation was tight; like Jesus, 
he must take a loaf of bread and feed it 
to the multitude. He had already gam-
bled $850 on two half-page adver-
tisements in the Manchester, N. H ., 
Union-uad". In South Dakota, with 
fewer "fringe" candidates, he had a 
greater chance of catching the media's 
attention. Besides, he told me, he had 
made mistakes in New H ampshire, 
and even if he could not rectify them in 
South Dakota, he certainly could in 
time for the New J ersey primary- the 
nation's last. In New J ersey, he would 
try to speak at the universities as early 
as possible. 
H e hoped to interest 
students enough to aid his campaign. 

I recalled what he had told me in our 
original conversation: "If you could tell 
me right now, if you rould tell me 'Mr. 
Zucker, you can have your ch01ce, 
would you want the housing crisis 
solved or would you want the Presi-
dency - you can'l have both, Mr. 
Zucker-what would you want?"' His 
voice dropped. "I would want the 
housing crisis solved." H e hoped his 
candidacy might raise interest in the 
book he was writing about housing and 
the free enterprise system, tentatively 
titled Swindle. After New H ampshire, 
he suggested, "people listen to you 
more carefully if you have been a 
Presidential candidate." 

Although he is making plans beyond 
the election, Irwin Zucker thinks he still 
has an outside chan(T to gain the 
nomination, if only because it is up for 
grabs. "None of the seven dwarves will 
survive Atlanta," he said, referring to 
the Democratic convention later this 
summer. "Their mentality- the verbal 
spitballs they shoot at each other-
really makes them dwarves." 

I had seen Zucker in the World of 
Politics-he was a small blur over the 
edge, a cursory note at the end of an 
article on page 35. Not until I became 
aware of the Political Wilderness could 
I hear his voice. In the transition, I 
discovered the meaning of politics for 
Zucker. "The Senate has an ATTI-
TUDE!" he had written in a position 
paper; as a citizen, he feels betrayed by 
the World of Politics. The main 
problem with politics, he told me, is 
that it is "difficult to get people 
interested in what is after all their 
business-government." He wants to 
revise the political structure. 

Irwin Zucker believes he has only to 
bring politicians back to the ideals of 
H arry Truman and Adlai Stevenson, 
who respected the people. The people, 
he feels, arc waiting. "He marches to a 
d ifferent drummer," Martin Zucker, 
owner of Marty's Famous Chicken in 
Red Bank, N. J., told me while his 
brother was in transit to South Dakota. 
"I think of him as Don Quixote-very 
sincere." Indeed, Zucker's absolute 
faith in the political mechanism makes 
him resemble Truman less than Qui-
xote. I, too, want to see politics 
working for me. But though I feel 
neglected by the exclusive World of 
Politics, 
I 
cannot share 
Zucker's 
devotion to political solutions. The 
people do not seem poised for a major 
makeover of the body politic. 

Zucker's reliance on the World of 
Politics 
aacomplish 
his 
goals 
perplexes me. Regardless of whether 
his views of a "politics of respect" make 
him reactionary, nostalgic, or forward-
looking-labeling Zucker is, as the 
cliche goes, as easy as nailingjello to a 
tree- the people arc not respondmg. 
New 
H ampshire seemed proof 
enough. Yet merely dismissing Zucker 
as a nut is too facile. His sideshow is 
more interesting than the rest of the 
political circus, even if I cannot agree 
with all of his views. As his brother told 
me, "I don't approve or disapprove of 
what he does, but I have to look at the 
reality of the situation: People are 
laughing at him . . . . But he's not 
hurting anyone, and who knows, he 
may even be helping." Is his approach 
getting him any closer to his goals? 

Zucker told me before New Hamp-
shire, "I'm 55 years old- my life is 
kinda over ... and I feel, in a very 
conscientious way, that I want to 
spend (the rest of) my life improving 
conditions in this country, in par-
ticular, solving the housing crisis." 

Lyndon LaRouche, who picked up 
2307 votes in the 1980 primary, 
garnered oniy 188 votes this time 
around, almost nine times Zucker's 
figure. 
The 
people dismissed 
LaRouche from the World of Politics 
after they had admitted him; Zucker 
has not had the chance to enter. "I told 
a newsman what I told you about 
housing," Zucker related after the 
primary, "and he just shrugged:" 

Zucker will probably never reach the 
World of Politics. But by his de-
finition, he does not belong there, 
precisely because it 
violates his 
conception of politics: It excludes 
grassroots perspectives. Ultimately, we 
share the cost of Zucker's Catch-22. As 
we glance through the glass towards 
the World of Politics, we overlook 
another, vital world, the Political 
Wilderness. Zucker has something to 
say, but we require him to enter the 
World of Politics before we will bother 
to listen to him. Until we recast our 
thinking, Zucker will remain ignored, 
preaching alone in the W ilderness .
