Spencer has just broken up with his 
girlfriend of three weeks, the best three 
weeks of his life. Night after night he 
lies awake in his room, tossing and 
turning. During the day he slouches 
morosely from class to class. He has 
stopped shaving and no longer brushes 
his teeth regularly. Finally, he breaks 
down and confesses to a friend: "Gosh, 
I handled that relationship poorly. 
Julie and I had such different expec-
tations. If only I could do it over 
again- I'd sit down with her and we'd 
a) draw little triangles to represent the 
dimensions of love, or b) draw little 
interlocking circles with pluses and 
minuses and boundaries of different 
thicknesses to represent our feelings 
toward each other. Or maybe we'd 
c) make really complex drawings, for 
which we'd need a score sheet to keep 
track of what all the horizontal and 
vertical lines and axes meant. I'm sure 
that would improve our understanding 
of one another, I just know it would." 
The millions of men and women in 
these tragic circumstances can relax.

edited by Robert Sternberg, Yale's 
IBM Professor of Psychology and 
Education, and Michael Barnes, a 
graduate student, offers 395 pages (less 
endnotes) of insight into that most 
painful human condition, love. Sixteen 
chapters by psychology professors, 
sociologists, and one psychotherapist 
attempt to define love in all of its 
incarnations, to explain how rela-
tionships work, and to represent them 
as a series of triangles, circles, and 
geometric configurations of inde-
terminate shape. In the end, no 
consensus on love's meaning emerges. 
Instead, Sternberg and Barnes present 
an overview of recent research into 
what they claim is a rapidly advancing 
field. 

The Psychology of Love contains three 
sections: "Global Theories of Love," 
"Theories of Romantic Love," and 
"Theories of Love and Relationship 
Maintenance." Individual chapters 
treat love as a biological imperative, a 
cultural construct, and, perhaps with 
Spencer in mind, a neurotic aber-
ration. The Psychology of Love works best 
as a scientific colloquy on the nature 
and meaning of love. Sternberg and 
Barnes have assembled a group of 
contentious scientists and an 
assortment of thought-provoking 
ideas. 

Some of the theories raised in The 
Psychology of Love might distract 
Spencer, or at least entertain him. One 
of the more intriguing experiments 
posits that love can be heightened, or 
even created,' using fear as a vehicle. 
Two researchers found that men ex-
pressed feelings of greater desire and

passion after successfully navigating a 
treacherous bridge than did men who 
crossed a safer bridge. If Spencer 
cannot lure Julie onto the ledge of a 
b uilding or into the lair of a wild boar 
to regain her affection, he might try 
reading about the research of John 
Alan Lee. In a chapter on "Love-
Styles," Lee suggests that eight types of 
love exist, including "eros" (physically 
d emonstrated love), "storge" (un-
e m otional, 
quiet, 
dispassionate 
affection), 
and "mania" Uealous, 
insatiable, insecure emotion). Spencer 
could try to turn himself into a "ludic" 
lover, one to whom "sex is for fun, not 
for expressing commitment, and love 
is not the most important activity in 
life." Julie would become just a distant 
memory. 

Not all modern psychologists hold 
Lee's nonjudgmental view of love-
styles. Stanton Peele argues in "Fools 
for Love" that certain kinds of love 
deserve skepticism and even censure: 
"Among its other failures, psycho-
logical theory has come perilously close 
to 
labeling 
social 
individual 
pathology as love." Peele recommends 
treating romantic love as one would a 
dru g 
add iction- by substituting a 
more positive activity, such as reading 
a daily newspaper. 

Other researchers, however, impart 
a broad significance to feelings of deep

and dependent love. Phillip Shaver, 
C indy H azan, and Donna Bradshaw 
hypothesize in "Love as Attachment" 
that "love has always and everywhere 
existed as a biological potential." They 
compare romantic love to the emotions 
a nd needs experienced by human and 
primate in fants for their caregiving 
parents. "Love as Attachment" and 
"Fools for Love" create a fascinating 
dialectic. 

The divergent conclusions of these 
two sets of researchers stem only in 
part from their different techniques 
and emphases. Their argument ori-
ginates in a more fundamental dis-
crepancy: their understanding of love. 

The problem of loosely defined terms 
persists th roughou t The Psychology of 
Love. Peele discusses passionate love as 
an incapacitating experience. In "A 
Vision of Romantic Love," Nathaniel 
Branden 
calls 
it "a triumph of 
psychological maturity." Robert 
Sternberg, in "Triangulating Love," 
defines certain 
kinds of love 
as 
"fatuous" or "infatuated" but 
distinguishes "consummate love" as 
clearly superior. 

Each of these 
researchers reaches a similar con-
clusion about the nature of ideal 
love- but poor Spencer, who doesn't 
really want to buy the book or to read 
it carefully, will leaf frantically through 
the pages in search of a quick solution 
to his romantic woes and come up 
confused. In a book that purports to 
compare and contrast theories of love, 
clarity is essential. 

The Psychology qf Love also falters 
when 
its 
contributors attempt 
universalize their theories. 
Most 
contributors concede 
that 
their 
experiments and 
conclusions a re 
historicaJJy and 
cuhuraJJy limited. 
They also share a less acknowledged 
bias, that of heterosexual orientation. 
Only two researchers specifically 
include homosexual love in their work.

Branden, describing the network of 
a 
complementary needs involved in "ro-
mantic love," omits the possibility of 
homosexuality. His list includes the 
following: "(T]he need to encounter, unite 
with, and live out vicariously our opposite-
gender possibilities: the need, in males, to 
find an embodiment in the world of the 
internal feminine; the need, in fe-
males, to find an embodiment in the 
world of the internal masculine." The 
section "Theories of Relationship and 
Love Maintenance" includes so many 
references to married couples that it is 
hard to miss the writers' drift: Love 
equals, or at least manifests itself 
correctly in, heterosexual marriage. 

David Buss' chapter "Love Acts: 
The Evolutionary Biology of Love" 
combines some of these omissions into 
a shoddy- this time sexist- theory. 
This chapter presents an example, 
albeit an exaggerated one, of the traps 
researchers can fall into when too eager 
to prove novel ideas. Buss hypothesizes 
that love, instead of being an attitude 
or a state of mind, manifests itself in a 
series of natural and common acts with 
the ultimate goal of reproduction. 
Males, Buss says, will search for 
"repFoductively valuable" females to 
increase 
their chances of having 
offspring. However, no overt signs of 
female fertility exist. Buss suggests that 
as a result, males typically look for 
"female age and health cues that signal 
reproductive capability- Youth, 
health, beauty, clear skin, smooth 
skin, lustrous hair, full lips, white 
teeth, lively gait." 

To prove his hypothesis, Buss con-
ducted experiments in which he asked 
respondents to select acts they thought 
were representative of "love." He 
found that men emphasized female 
physical appearance more than women 
did. Ignoring the vast array of cultural 
and social conditions that may have led 
men to consider physical appearance 
an important factor in selecting a 
mate, Buss offers this result up as proof 
of his hypothesis. 

If any of the other researchers ('rr, it 
is on the side of caution, preferring

oversimplified explanations of com-
mon sense attitudes toward love to 
more challenging theories. This is 
most evident when writers suggest 
diagnostic tools for improving love 
relationships. The value of drawing a 
diagram to represent an emotional 
state is that it allows the people 
involved to distance themselves from 
their emotions. Quite possibly some-
one might prefer drawing a triangle 
whose vertices represent deci-
sion/commitment, passion, and 
intimacy- as Sternberg suggests- to 
exploring 
these 
feelings 
outright. 
However, 
The 
Psychology of Love 

The Psychology of love 
demonstrates the ease with which 
definitions of all of these words can 
confuse even an experienced scientist. 
Asking a person in love to reduce love's 
complexities to a geometric shape can 
be dangerous, especially if that person 
already has trouble communicating 
effectively. 

Some of the other 
researchers 
acknowledge 
this difficulty and 
attempt to solve it with more intricate 
pictorial 
representations of love. 
Wendy Williams and Michael Barnes, 
in their chapter "Love Within Life," 
provide a model of a love relationship 
that includes an internal and an ex-
ternal world for each participant in the 
relationship, as weli as boundaries 
where these worlds intersect. The area 
of each space is important as well. The 
authors load each aspect of the model 
with an inordinate amount of infor-
mation- for example, in the "external 
world" they lump together family 
members, children, hobbies, and other 
interests. Still, Williams and Barnes 
concede in the end that "boundaries 
are more complex" than the ones they 
present. If even this complex and 
abstruse model forces major over-
simplification, it may not be worth the 
effort. 

attempt 
translate 
psychological theory into real life 
l produces a 
strained conflation of 
scientific jargon and 
informality. 
Plagued by the need to appeal to a 
wider readership, the authors often 
resort to trite cultural symbols that 
undercut their professionalism. 
"Indeed, the expression 'Don't leave 
home without it!' might be more 
important with reference to love than 
to one's American Express card .. . . ," 
Bernard Murstein concludes in his "A 
Taxonomy of Love." Another contri-
butor begins by stating, "A song by the 
Doobie Brothers asks where we would 
be now, without love. This question 
captures two key themes of this 
chapter." By depending on 
cliches, the authors undermine our 
estimation of their scientific analysis. 
On occasion, they also reveal them-
selves to be as silly as the cliches they 
use. In his 30-page article on "Love-
Styles," John Alan Lee devotes ten 
pages to complaining that the other 
researchers on the playground have 
not noticed 
him. "(T]here is 
no 
reference to my 1970-76 publications 
in Munro and Adams . . . . Dion and 
Dion [make] no reference to my work, 
even though I was teaching in another 
department of the same university." 
Disagreement among psychologists 
and sociologists is endemic to the 
discipline, 
but 
it 
should spawn 
productive inquiry rather than· feelings 
of injury.
