Seventeen Yale volunteers returned 
from winter break to find that Dwight 
Hall had decided to discontinue Group 
Work, a program that arranged weekly 
day trips for over 40 children living in 
the Quinnipiac View (Q-View) 
housing project in Fair Haven. Group 
Work depended on a Dwight Hall van 
to transport the children. But the Yale 
Motor Pool, which manages all Yale 
vehicles, charged that volunteers took 
the program's van on unauthorized 
personal trips. "We found that vans 
signed out to go to Q-View were 
coming back with 600 miles put on 
them over the weekend," Dwight Hall 
Director Jack Hasegawa said. The 
Motor Pool 
refused to continue 
insuring the van; Dwight Hall could 
not afford to insure it; and Group 
Work was paralyzed. 

Dwight Hall considered keeping the 
van in use but feared being sued in the 
case of an accident. This almost 
happened three years ago when a 
Group Work child fell out of a moving 
van. "The injury wasn't serious, and 
the parents were glad to have their 
child back safe," Hasegawa said. "But 
in the second-most litigious state in the 
country, any one of those kids could 
still wipe us off the face of the non-
profit world." 

Dwight Hall sold the van and left 
Group Work leaders looking for 
options. Brian Lee (BR '88), the 
student coordinator of the program, 
had hoped that the van would be given 
to another volunteer program, which 
would lend it to Group Work. But the 
job training program that acquired 
the van uses it on weekday afternoons 
and weekends, the only times Group 
Work members could meet with the 
children. Lee said he had considered 
having volunteers take buses to the 
Q-View 
project. 
"But the neigh-
borhood isn't very safe," he said, "and 
the purpose of the program was to take 
the kids places they couldn't usually 
go." 

When Group Work started 10 years 
ago, volunteers had no choice but to 
use buses for transportation. At that 
time, Q-View had a community center 
which served as the program's activity 
site. In 1983, the New Haven Boys and 
Girls Club sponsored the program and let 
the volunteers use a van and the Club's 
building. Later, the YMCA provided 
a van and driver, but, according to 
Hasegawa, 
their 
service proved 
unreliable. To make the program 
independent, Becky Bunnell (BR '84), 
a former director of Group Work, 
raised $11,000 from alumni to buy the 
van for Dwight Hall. Now, however, 
without Motor Pool support, Group 
Work cannot function as it has in the 
past. 

Some volunteers still take buses or 
borrow cars to see the children. But 
most of the students have made good-
bye trips to Q-View. Lee, who will 
graduate this term, said he can no 
longer make a commitment to the 
program. In order for Group Work to 
rebuild, 
he said, 
students must 
"conceive of a new way" to run the 
program. Hasegawa agreed. "Dwight 
Hall 
is 
student-run and student-
oriented ," he said. "If people want to 
revive Group Work, they'll have to 
take the initiative."
