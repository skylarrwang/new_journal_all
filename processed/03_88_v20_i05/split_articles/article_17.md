through a lucrative job in corporate 
law. Steve Fazman (LAW '87), an 
associate 
lawyer at

Weiss, 
Rifkind, 
Wharton and Garrison,

firm might carry more weight than a 
public interest group in gaining him a 
government job. 
Some point 
to 
Arthur Liman (LAW '57), a corporate 
lawyer who headed the congressional 
Iran-Contra hearings, to show that a 
private law career and public service 
need not be mutually exclusive .. 
The failure of Yale students to turn 
to the public sector reflects a growing 
national problem. The most recent 
convention of the American Asso-
ciation of Law Schools focused on the 
tension between high salaries and 
social obligation. The Law School feels 
added pressure to nudge its students 
toward public service: Its pride is at

interest reputation is an integral part of 
the self-image of the school." But the 
deck is stacked against efforts to 
·maintain that reputation. Every year 
at the October Job Fair, about 20 
public sector groups vie with 420 
private firms for Yale law students' 
attention .
