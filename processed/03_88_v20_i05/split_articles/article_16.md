Serving Tradition 
Cynthia Cameros 
Fall, not spring, is courting season at 
Yale Law School. Hundreds of re-
cruiters from private law firms visit the 
school and ply third-year students with 
lunch at the Park Plaza. Some provide 
airfare to the firm and a night's stay at 
one of the city's best hotels. For 
students interested in working in the 
public sector, getting even an inter-
view can prove difficult. Public interest 
organizations rarely can afford to send 
a recruiter. If one does come, the 
representative and students typically 
gather in a spare room for a brown bag 
lunch. 

Since the 1920's, Yale Law School 
has had a reputation for promoting 
public service. As proponents of legal 
realism, faculty members considered 
law in terms of its social consequences. 
This concern prompted several pro-
fessors to stop teaching law and instead 
to wield it in the New Deal admini-
stration. Although some law students 
call the reputation a thing of the past, 
Associate Dean of the Law School 
Stephen Yandle argues, "Yale Law 
School is recognized as a spawning 
ground 
for 
lawyers 
who commit 
themselves full- or part-time to public 
interest law." Now, 
Law School 
administrators worry that the charms 
of private firms will outshine those of 
the public sector. The Law School has 
instituted several programs to en-
courage students with an interest in 
public service. So far, the programs 
have had little effect. 

Law students' interest in govern-
ment and public interest law has 
diminished since the 1970's. In 1971, 
almost a quarter of the graduates 
entered the public sector. Fifteen years 
later, the percentage had dropped to 
six; Yale trailed the national average 
by ten percent. Private firms, mean-
while, 
have 
attracted 
Yale 
law 
graduates. Forty percent opted for a 
private law career in 1971. Students' 
interest peaked in 1983, when 57 
percent of law students took jobs at 
private firms. And last year, 42 
percent chose this path. The private 
sector 
percentages exclude 
those 
pursuing judicial clerkships, which 
have steadily grown more popular and 
often provide stepping stones to a ,. 
corporate career. 

Rising salaries in private law firms 
have attracted students while public 
interest organizations have failed to 
match their pace. According tb Yan-
dle, before the 1970's, public and
private sector salaries could compete. 
Today, a starting salary in public 
interest runs $21,792, 
while new 
associate lawyers at Cravath, Swaine 
and Moore earn $71,000-the highest 
starting salary at a private firm. 

Even reform-minded lawyers have 
entered the private sector. 
David 
Huebner (LAW '86) had found his 
ideal job at the Center for Law as 
Public Interest, representing clients in 
environmental and anti-fraud cases. 
The salary was low, but enough to live 
on. After 18 months the Center ran out 
of funding for him. Because of his 
pressing loan payments, 
Huebner 
joined a medium-sized private firm 
rather than search for another public 
interest job. There, he feels less 
motivated. "I prefer to work for the 
victim," he says. 

Academic loans force many Yale 
students to choose private firms. 
Fifteen years ago a student's budget 
averaged $5750. This year, tuition, 
books, and living expenses add up to 
$20,030. As a result, most students tap 
a variety of federal loans to underwrite 
their educational expenses. The 
average debt, $28,000, exceeds most 
starting salaries in the public sector. 
Ten percent of Yale Law School 
graduates owe over $37,000 in loans. 

Recognizing the financial dilemma 
graduates face in the public sector, the 
Law School established several 
programs to aid students leaning in 
that direction. It offers fellowships to 
subsidize public sector jobs over the 
summer. In addition, law students 
fund their own Â· summer programs. 
Together the two programs sponsor 
over 50 students every summer. But 
before the institution of PICA in 1985, 
students lacked the longterm aid to 
help launch them into a public service 
career. The Public Interest Careers 
Assistance program will forgive a law 
student's loan debt after eight to ten 
years of public sector work. Yale 
lagged behind most major law schools, 
including Harvard and Northwestern, 
in developing such a program. 

When Dean of the Law School 
Harry Wellington raised the idea of 
loan forgiveness in 1982, he received a 
hostile reception at the provost's office. 
President Bartlett Giamatti, Provost 
William Brainard, and Yale Cor-
poration members rejected the 
proposal despite the Law School's 
strong support and the 
financial 
backing of alumni. 
The admini-
stration, faculty, and students fought 
for loan forgiveness. The new Law 
School Dean, Guido Calabresi , 
threatened to quit if the program were 
not instituted. When the Corporation 
rejected PICA, Calabresi recalls, "I 
told the provost that I could not accept 
that. I would not have stayed on as 
dean." On a 
separate front, law 
students wrote letters urging Cor-
poration members to approve the loan 
forgiveness program. 

In 1985 they finally did. But the 
plan was unreasonable, requiring 
students to stay in the public sector up 
to 20 consecutive years. When Benno 
Schmidt, Jr. , the former dean of 
Columbia Law School, became Yale's 
president, he liberalized the plan. 
Bypassing the Corporation, he drafted 
a ten-year schedule for loan forgive-
ness. Financial backing comes from 
the annual incomes of the Jus tin T. 
Golenbock Memorial Fund and the 
Rita C. Davidson Memorial Fund, 
alumni 
funds 
earmarked 
the 
program. Not surprised by the strong 
alumni support, Yandle says, "The 
alumni are in tune with the spirit of 
Yale Law School. In their minds a 
degree from Yale Law School carries 
with it a public obligation." 

To enter the PICA program, grad-
uates must earn below $40,000 in 
either a public interest position or in a 
local, state, or federal government job. 
Students who graduated before the 
program's adoption still can apply. 
Yandle is considering whether students 
with judicial clerkships, now excluded 
from the program, should qualify. So 
far, 
aid office 
has 
accepted 19 students. 

Currently an applicant for loan 
forgiveness, Lisa Stansky (LAW '89) 
works as a staff attorney for the New 
Orleans Legal Assistance Corporation, 
far from the traditional enclaves of her 
classmates in New York City and 
Washington, D.C. The gap is not only 
geographical. Of her brush with the 
corporate world, she says, "I in-
terviewed with some firms but felt that 
I wouldn't fit in, because I wouldn't be 
able to do the work I wanted to do. 
The interviewers saw that I would have 
qualms representing their clients and 
asked me what I was doing there." Her 
current job enables her to concentrate 
on a major concern of hers-legal 
problems of the poor. In exchange for 
work she enjoys, Stansky does her own 
secretarial 
work. 
She will 
make 
$18,500 this year. 

Stansky presently owes $38,950 in 
loans from her law and undergraduate 
education. For the first two years of the 
program, PICA will lend her enough 
money to cover her educational pay-
ments. In return, she must contribute 
a percentage of her annual income. 
This year she will owe $1275. After 
three years, the Law School will begin 
to pay off her debt, expecting only her 
personal income contribution. Unless 
Stansky leaves public interest before 
the ten years of the program are up, 
PICA will pay off the rest of her loans. 

Even with the PICA program, how-
ever, the percentage of Yale students 
choosing the public sector has not 
increased 
significantly. 
The 
percentage doubled after the first year 
of the program, from four to eight 
percent, but numbers have fallen in 
the past two years. According to Tracy 
Sivitz (LAW '88), one of the students 
who campaigned for PICA, the pro-
gram offers only a weak incentive to 
enter public service law. "Loan 
deferral is just enabling you to pay 
rent, pay for gas, and clothe yourself," 
she says. Yandle admits that the 
percentages will stay the same until 
public sector salaries become more 
competitive with the private sector. 

To reconcile financial and altruistic 
goals, graduates explore other paths to 
public service. Some graduates per-
form pro bono work as part of the jobs in 
private firms. Others plan to serve the 
public in a government or justice
