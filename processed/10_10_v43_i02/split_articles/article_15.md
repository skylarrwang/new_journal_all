was weirded out but totally into 
it). 
Several clients 
often the 
toughest-looking · 
guys 
have 
passed out in the chair. 
As I listen to Duck talk, there's 
little doubt in my mind that I'd fall 
into that last category. I tell him 
about my chronic squea rnishness, 
and rather than judge me for 
it, Duck nods knowingly. 
Our 
minds, he says, can't tell the 
difference between reality and 
fantasy on their own. It takes 
information from the five senses 
to confirm the distinction. 
So 
when the mind signals the body 
to generate tons of chemicals in 
response to, or anticipation of, 
something horrible, and then that 
horrible something really just feels 
like, say, a ticklish sunburn, those 
unused chemicals go 
haywire. 
That's when a tattooee passes out, 
or when I start to feellightheaded. 
Chemically speaking, imagining 
getting a tattoo can be worse than

It should come as no shock, 
then, that when I drive to Shelton 
one sunny Thursday morning to 
watch my first-ever tattooing, I 
grip the steering wheel a bit too 
tightly .. I breathe a little heavily as I 
. accompany Duck on his customary 
trip to t~e Dunkin' Qonuts down 
the street, where the employees 
~ 
know him so well that they often 
have his large coffee ready to go 
by the time he walks through 
the doors. Today, Duck makes a 
miniature performance of putting 
. . 
change in their tip cup, (shaking 
the cup in mock-indignation: 
"What's this?. It's empty! I'm just 
gonna have to fill it for ya!"). . 
At 11 a.m., a guy natned Ron 
with a build like a defensive tackle 
and arms sheathed in ink walks 
' 
through the front door of the shop. 
He and Duck joke like old.friends: 
Ron -worked at Excalibur a while 
back as a piercer and ~pprentice 
tattoo artist. He's here now to get 
some work on his arms finished 
before he ships off to Iraq in late 
Novembe,r, and he's brought his 
fiancee, a 19 year-old ballerina 
na tned Nicole. 
This is a special occasion: 
Ron and Nicole, the soon-
to-be-newlyweds, are getting 
matching puzzle-piece tattoos. 
· 
It's about Ron's millionth 
tattoo, but it's Nicole's first, 
and so Ron's dad Randy and 
their fa rnily friend Elaine 
show up a few minutes later to 
witness 
the 
important 
event. 
All the other folks in the room, 
excluding myself, have at least one 
of Duck's tattoos on their bodies, 
and they're here to see a loved one 
' join their ranks. 
As 
faanilial 
chatter fills 
room, Duck goes through his prep 
work. He sets a paper plate on the 
counter, smears it with a thin strip 
of Vaseline, a,nd sticks two tiny 
caps onto it. He fills these caps 
with ink, which he stores in rows 
ofbottles that look like transparent 
cafeteria ketchup containers 
one 
pure black, the other watered down 
for gray shading. Then, delivering 
a well-rehearsed speech, he shows 
Nicole her needle, removes it from 
its factory packaging, and slides it 
through a disposable plastic tube, 
which acts as a guide a1;1d a handle 
-
and attaches to the machine· itself. 
Each needle is actually a thin metal 
rod connected to a duster ·of one 
to twelve tiny pins 
more pins for 
a thicker stroke. The butt end of 
the rod attaches to a spring-loaded 
bar on the machine, which sits 
over a series of electromagnetic 
coils. A long black wire carries 
an 
electrical 
current 
from the power source to 
these coils, and 120 times per 
~econd, the electricity charges the 
magnets, the bar is pulled, and the

needle enters the skin. 
Nicole has chosen to place the 
puzzle-piece on her foot 
she's 
used to going en pointe for ballet, 
and so assumes she has a high 
degree of pedal pain tolerance. 
Duck rubs her foot with a Speed 
Stick to provide a sticky coating for 
the stencil, then transfers the hand-
drawn design onto her skin. He 
can tell she's tense and he loosens 
her up by cracking a couple jokes. 
Ron's here to comfort her, so 
Nicole doesn't need too much 
loosening. I'll later see customers 
that walk into · Excalibur as if to 
· face the guillotine 
real bundles of 
nerves 
and watch Duck pull out 
a new tactic for each one. ''Are you 
nervous?" he'll ask, before putting 
on an agitated, nebbishy voice. 
"Well dbn't be nervous. You'll make 
me nervous, my hands will get all 
sweaty, the needle will slip ... " Or 
he'll spin a client around in the 
chair over and over again until she 
finally stops scrunching up her 
shoulders. Or he'll put a hand on 
a customer's back and say, ''Are you 
alright?" then raise his voice, look 
around the room, and repeat, ''Are , 
you alright?" then throw his arms · 
into dra rna tic full extension ·and 
mock-shout, as if on the deck of a 
sinking ship, "Is everybody alright?" 
His years of practice at clowning, 
maritime and otherwise, clearly 
pay off. At the craft of tattooing, 
Duck is a pro, but at the art of 
placating a nervous customer, he's 
an absolute virtuoso. 
No diversion tactic can take 
the anxious sting out of the next 
moment, though~ when he picks 
up the machine with a latex-gloved

This is where I see blood rising up .

in those high school assemblies, 
and try to -think about the finer 
points of my recent computer-

almost 
imperceptibly in the room. The 
banter now continues as before, 
· the radio still plays, the DVD 
screens still display a fish tank 
video Duck bought at Bed Bath 
& Beyond. But something about 
the quality of Nicole's presence in 
the space has shifted. 
Ron and 
Elaine talk to her as Duck works, 
and she responds, laughing at 
their jokes, quipping back at their 
digs. Yet she's distracted. A pat t 
of her isn't there. A part of her is 
rhythmic singing and drumming: 
The sensation of pain was drawn 
out and segmented, an end in itself. 
In Hawaii, tattoo artists colored 
the tips of women's tongues as part 
of a mourning ceremony for a dead 
chief just as the ink becarne a 
permanent memorial mark, so also 
the tongue-pricking accomplished 
a kind of corporeal mortification. 
When the art first 
reached 
America with the addition of the 
Tattooed Man to the freak show 
line-up, the grotesque allure of 
pain was central in its populist 
appeal: P.T. Barnum advertised 
his inunensely profitable freak 
Prince Constantine, a middle-
aged Grecian inked head to toe, 
as a white man captured by island 
savages 
and forcibly 
tattooed. 
Crowds flocked to Constantine's 
booth to hear lurid stories of 
agony and swelling as much as

Back 
then, even for decades after the

1891, many artists poked by

in New York ·or Boston, a slimy

Duck's studio, 
where 
every 
hand is gloved, every spray bottle 
pla5tic-baggied, and every needle 
formally goodbyed en route to the 
sharps container, is a far cry from 
the . abodes of Charlie Wagner,

anything but an ordeal. But the 
pain is inescapable. And to try to 
escape it in the first place would 
be, in a way, cheating or at 
least missing out on a part of the 
experience. When you get a tattoo, 
"the memory of it gets locked into 
your emotional psyche," Duck said 
to me once. "Every time the needle 
hits, your mind is interlocked with 
the emotion." 
That's why .Duck doesn't like 
flash, and why he refuses to tattoo 
customers with designs that are 
just plain stupid· ·(although he

etched into your back or your 
ankle or your arm, when you can 
literally feel its every contour being 
imprinted on your person, it takes 
on a heightened significance. 
Randy, Ron's dad, has a stunning 
gorilla-head tattoo spanning his 
formidable bicep. Duck designed 
it. Multiple psychic readings have 
identified the gorilla as Randy's 
power animal, a 
fact further 
attested by a second Duck-made 
tattoo on his calf, showing his 
own screa rning face merging, like 
the Batman villain Two-Face, with 
that of the ape. Whether or not the 
silverback and its accompanying 
symbolism had any real import 
in Randy's life before the tattoo is 
irrelevant: Once he's felt each hair 
and muscle pricked into his arm, 
that ape acquires a primal meaning . 
One of the many images on 
Ron's labyrinthine ink-cratnmed 
arm is a Calvin and Hobbes 
design in memory of Elaine's son, 
a close friend who died young .

I learn about these two men's 
tattoos while Duck is still at work 
on Nicole's foot. And by the time 
the completed· puzzle piece sits 
on her skin atop an angry cloud 
of swelling, and tiny red drops 
· begin to ooze around its edges 
like condensation, I don't feel the 
lightheadedness that I know I 
should be feeling. That is, I don't 
feel it until Ron, leaning in gently 
to take a look, suddenly slaps 
the finished design hard. Nicole 
jolts up and tries to hit him as he 
runs away, and the whole room 
laughs (except for one horrified 
Yale student who nearly spills the 
remainder of his latte). Ron says 
he did it to "set the ink," but Duck 
tells me that he's really carrying on 
a hallowed tradition: Whenever 
someone gets his or her first tattoo, 
someone else in the room who's 
already been through the process 
offers a little mild abuse to the 
-tender area. Well, not always mild:
