Enrolling in business school seems incongruous 
with Hammer's ideals

organizing, anti-capitalist, biking-playwright doing

"People asked me 
what's a socialist democrat like 
you doing in business school?" he laughed. "But it 
really is a school of management." 

Even after Ha tnmer graduated, he stuck around 
New Haven. Calling it the cultural capital of the 
state, Hatnmer says there's nowhere he'd rather live

and work than here. From the Schubert and the Yale 
Repertory Theater, to the nearby (bike-accessible!) 
kayaking spots, New Haven is an ideal location 
for Harnmer. And as a community activist, it's also 
perfect for him to spread the gospel of cycling and

his belief in democratic socialism. 

As we turn onto Crown Street, Hatnmer begins 
to chatter excitedly about his hopes for the new 
pedicab company. In addition to working morning 
and afternoon rush hours, and orchestrating pickups 
and drop-offs from the State Street train station, 
Hatnmer wants to ·start a service for the Crown 
Street club scene on weekends. Though he quickly 
adds that he's aware bicycles won't create world 
peace, it's impossible to ignore Hatnmer's ever-
present idealism, his hope that even a little bit of 
good, clean business on Crown might help diminish 
the drunken brawls that occur there. 

"I see bicycling like a lot of other things in 
society," he says, his eyes lighting up for a moment. 
"It should be available to everyone." 

The business Ha truner founded, called BEEEP! 
(Bicycle Education, Entrepreneurship and 
Enrichment Prograans) is the fruit of his idealism. 
The business's for-profit wing manages the pedicab 
rides. The nonprofit side hosts cycling tours for New 
Haven youth, sets up tandem rides for the blind, 
and runs an adaptive biking progra an that allows 
paraplegics to use their hands to bike. BEEEP! lets . ... . -. 
OCTOBER 2010 
Hammer dabble in his own egalitarian universe of 
equal-opportunity-bicycling. 

But theater, Hammer tells me, is the arena where 
he taps into his most extreme passions. He recalls 
one of the several· musical revues he has composed: 
• 
"The Touring Bicycle Repair Clinic Theater." The 
production toured vaudeville-style 
he and the 
. actors traveled from one town green to another, 
. bringing mechanics with them to fix the audience's 
bicycles while the actors performed. 

Hammer breaks into one of the songs 'from the 
show. The original composition, inspired by Pierre 
Lallement, who is often credited with inventing the 
bicycle in the 1860's, tells the story of a man who 
builds a flying bicycle that eventually soars over the 
English Channel. In Ha •nmer's plot line, the man 
tests the contraption by flying it around the New 
Haven Green. 

Harnmer sings: · 
"Though twas said could not be done by expert 
panels 
A bicycle jle,w oJer the English Channel. .. 
... SoJ if we take our cue from Leonardo 
Think about the future hard now 
Fight to win a place for bikes in the world of our . 
children 
Where its not a pain to take them on the train 
And bike lanes and bike paths separate us from the 
trollies 
And from the few automobiles remaining 
On the way weJll win a few 
And lose some too and when we do wlll know 
That weJre not throughJ the myopia of a few 
~ Wont keep us from our bicycle utopia 
Wont keep us from our bicycle utopiaJJ

As we ride down Crown Street, I wonder if I can 
catch a glimpse of East Rock Park from the Green. 
I think of how Ha truner's moment of crisis is at the 
center of his idealism, how the realities of violence 
and crime and streets without bike lanes encroach 
on his utopian vision of the city he loves. 

From the top of East Rock, however, with the 
city stretching out in perfect miniature, you might 
imagine that a flying bicycle could sail over the spin~s 
of New Haven, uninhibited by gravity 
and that, if 
you fell, an urnbrella atop a bicycle helmet would be 
enough to help you glide safely to the ground .

Always have. 
The goriest shoot-
'em-up movies and the grisliest 
burn-victim photos don't faze me, 
but I shudder at the mere thought 
of any · implement that pierces, 
pricks, rends, or tears. And the idea 
of people subjecting themselves 
to said implements willingly has 
always occupied a special place in 
the pantheon ofThings That Freak

documentary videos

injury presentations in high school

my head with dizzying 
colored lights. The assembly · on

I spent those 
forty-five minutes with my hands 
so firmly cupped on my eyes that I 
thought they might stick.

Yes, that's right: In a foyer 
packed 
with 
bizarre 
objects 
jostling for attention: (medieval 
sword mounted on wall, slideshow 
of nipple piercings and tattooed 
. . . . . . 
private parts running on loop) 
; perhaps the most ~ye-catching 
is a bulky crate overflowing with 
squishy foarn ducks: Each duck's 
chest reads, "I GOT PRICKED @ 
EXCALIBUR." Every client who 
gets tattooed takes one home, and 
they seJ;Ve a double purpose: On 
the one hand, as keepsakes, and 
on the other, as yielding ·objects 
for those clients to squeeze with 
all their might as the store's owner, 
using a tiny machine powered by 
electromagnetic coils, drives a set 
of pins into their skin at a rate of 
120-140 penetrations per second. 

Most of these ducks, I'm told, end 
up decapitated. 

Most tattoo parlors don't have 
crates of duck toys,in their lobbies. 
But again, Excalibur is not your 
typical parlor. Mo,st tattoo parlors 
have racks of pre-designed images, 
or "flash," hanging in their main 
rooms; Excalibur offers only custom 
designs. Most tattoo parlors have 
dim heavy-metal· music leaking 
from the speakers in the corner; 
Excalibur has, depending on the 
day and mqod, a soundtrack . of 
old-timey jazz, or classic rock, 
or bagpipe -music.

parlors have a , staff of cranky

Charles "Duck'' Unitas. Duck 
is the owner and sole proprietor 
("Head chef, dishwasher, and all 
that," as he puts it), a gregarious 
middlc;!-aged man . with a vaguely 
avuncular grey beard, a passion 
for wildly-patterned short-sleeve 
button-downs, and an uncanny 
knack for putting his customers at 
ease. 

Duck recognizes, with a hint 
of pride, that he's not what you'd 
expect in a tattoo artist, and since 
I'm, without a · doubt, the opposite 
of the typical tat-parlor patron, 
we make a pretty nice pair. He's 
a born storyteller, and I spend 
hours listening to him spin out 
his personal history as he reclines 
in his adjustable tattooing chair, 
his cowboy-booted feet perched 
on a high stool, one arm playing 
with hJs earring, the other flapping 
about~_ .. expressively as his voice 
jumps-between registers. 

Duck, who says. he picked up 
crayons as a toddler and never put 
them down, is a lifelong artist, 
but he got into tattooing late.

How much does it hurt? 

In

the question that brought me to 
Excalibur.

Excalibur's doors

elephant in tattooing's proverbial 
room. Among tattoo artists and 
tattooees, there's little consensus 
on the answer. 

"It's like a tickle 
and a sunburn at the sa tne time," 
one of Duck's frequent customers 
tells me. (Then again, this is 
coming from a man who pierced 
his own lip with a sharpened nail 
while still in middle school.) "It 
just feels like a scratch," says 
another. On the other hand, one 
female tat-enthusiast writes in Self 
magazine that a couple of flowers 
on her left ankle hurt more than 
her Caesarean section.
