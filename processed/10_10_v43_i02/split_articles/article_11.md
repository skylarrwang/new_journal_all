n 1793, Ebenezer Brackett larnented: 
Yet scarce are mentiona in the historic page . 
Thy mother Britain's best-deserving sons, 
Who, fled from fate, and second Charles's rage, 
Resorted hither 
here reposa their bones. 

In 2010, New Haven native Nathaniel Zelinsky'13 
suggests Brackett's concerns about the preservation 
of this historical record were unfounded. The legend 
of Britain's best deserving sons lauded by Brackett 
in his "A Poem Commemorative of Goffe," Whaley 
and Dixwell is, according to Zelinsky, "a New Haven . 
story that· everyone knows. I don't remember not 
knowing about it." And indeed, it is a staple tale of 
the city's elementary school curriculum~ . . . 

The legend known to today's New Haven 
schoolchildren is simple: The judges fled . to 
Massachusetts and then to New Haven, where they 
hid from the king's agents. "It would really stink if 
they got caught and killed, but I've always .assumed 
that they survived," says Zelinsky. His indoctrination 
into the myth went no further. A brief foray into the 
marble walls of the Beinecke (or on the Internet), 
however, illuminates the rest of the history . 

The year is 1648.'1he location of our tale, England. 
The country has been devastated by two decades of 
civil war, and Oliver Cromwell's government has 
found the former King, Charles I, guilty of "High 
Treason and other high Crymes," a sentence that 
calls for beheading. Among the ·54 men who sign the 
death · warrant are John Dixwell, Edward Whalley, 
and his son-in-law Willian1 Goffe. After sbme legal 
hullabaloo, King Charles dies theatrically on Jan. 30, 
1649, declaring, "I am the martyr of the people." His 
head is severed with a single blow. 
Unfortunately for 
our, heroes, 
the 
English 
Restoration of 1660 brings King Charles II into 
power with a vengeance. Here then, the story starts 
in earnest; the death warrant that Whalley, Goffe, 
and Diwell signed condemning Charles I now serves 
as their own death warrant. They are not safe in 
England. Whalley and Goffe flee over 3,000 miles 
to colonial Carnbridge, Mass., where Gov. Endicott 
welcomes them warmly in late July of 1660. While 
the historical record is unclear, Dixwell presumably 
makes his way to America as well.
