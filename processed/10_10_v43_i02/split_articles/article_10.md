oboes playing in the distance. 
"Sunday in the Park" takes place 
annually in Edgerton Park, a 22-
acre site given to the city in 1965. 
The grounds were first home to Eli 
Whitney and later to industrialist 
Frederick Brewster, who replaced 
Whitney's mansion with a Tudor-
style house he called "Edgerton," 
for its location on the edge of 
town. Brewster commissioned the 
grounds to be redesigned in the 
4 
New Haven tradition, occurring 
one Sunday in mid-September 
every year. They bring to town 
live music and attractions, such 
as chess, wagon rides, moonwalk, 
and Hula Hoops in an endeavor 
to create a welcoming fair, where 
fa rnilies relax and friends mingle in 
the early days of fall. 
Standing arnid farnilies arnbling

baby 
carriages 
and 
unicyclists 
circling 
around 
clown outfits, I make my way to 
a wagon half-full with passengers · 
and climb on. Sitting on my left is 
-
a young girl with short blonde curls 
and pink cheeks. She is waving to 
an imaginary crowd as the wagon 
pulls off with a creak. 
The 
ponies 
gently trot the 
wagon around a white fountain 
whose recent renovation was made 
possible by the $19,000 raised at 
last year's fair. The pale marble is 
now bathed in the morning sun 
and emits a faint glow, like a giant 
halo. 
A turn of the wagon reveals a 
greenhouse on my left. Behind the 
frosted glass, blurred figures move 
among clouds· 'of green, red, and 
yellow. Edgerton Park Conservancy 
' 
is offering introductory tours of 
tropical plants to elementary school 
students. The simulation rainforest 
allows children to experience rare 
plants first-hand, and even take 
home their favorite kinds. A boy 
marches out of the greenhouse 
carrying an exotic potted plant. 
My little neighbor gasps, clutches 
her mother's arm, and squirms on 
the seat. I can tell she wants one 
too. 


As the wagon makes its way along 
a narrowing path that disappears 
behind a hill, we enter a quieter 
area. Entertainment booths, from 
a chess stand to a petting zoo, 
sprinkle both sides of the road, all 
requiring pre-purchased tickets. 
Next to a desk behind the "Yale 
Peabody 
Muse.um" 
banner, 
a 
bespectacled woman bows over a 
boy of six or seven in a Superman 
T-shirt. She puts a small wooden 
ring on his head and tries to 
balance a giant shallow ba •nboo 
basket on top of it. 
"This is how people in the 
Philippines carry bananas," she 
explain~~,· 
"Isn't -rhat fascinating." The boy's 
mother nods and pushes on her 
son's shoulders. "C'mon now, see if 
you can walk!" 
His face covered by the shadow 
of the basket, the boy stumbles 
forward several steps and falls onto 
his knees. The basket roBs off onto 
the grass and his mother chuckles, 
retrieving the basket from its 
landing spot. 
Once distant, screa•ns and cheers 
have grown louder as our wagon 
winds through the booths and 
veers toward the front of the hill. 
The girl next to me suddenly sits 
up straight, and her eyes widen as 
she cries, "Look! Bungee jump!" 
The wagon comes to a halt but 
the eager little bodies inside keep 
fidgeting. 
The children throw 
themselves over -the rails, land 
awkwardly on their sides, climb 
up, and rush ahead, their parents 
trailing behind with backpacks 
and calling out their natnes. 
When her mother finally catches 
her, my new friend is already 
in line for the bungee jump. 
"Amelie 
there." 
Her 
mother 
squeezes a ticket into her fist, 
while Amelie eyes the boy ahead of 
her. He is already standing on the 
giant tra•npoline, putting his legs 
through loops of a safety strap with 
a volunteer's help. 

"We come 
ere every year, 
Amelie's mother says as she shakes 
her head. "She never gets enough 
of it." 
Amelie hands her $2 ticket to 
the volunteer and races toward the 
trampoline. She knows she's about 
to soar and flip in the sky. 
A list of attractions in the park 
continues to spill out from the·· 
loudspeaker above my head. "It's 
Sunday in the Park." The voice 
repeats, "Sunday in the Park!"
