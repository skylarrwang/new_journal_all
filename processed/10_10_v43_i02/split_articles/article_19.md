Newhallville neighborhood, has

cornrows. The strings are red, the

gang with roots in California and 
members all over the country . 
including many in New Haven. 
West wears a red and black plastic 
belt, a red necklace, and two plastic 
buttons on her shirt, each with a

or perhaps 
because of this, West is a Blood. 
The 
New 
Haven 
Police 
Department sits on Union Avenue 
in the Hill, the neighborhood that 
forms the city's southern border. 
It is surrounded on three sides, by 
the Church Street South public 
housing projects, a train station, 
and highways that lead out of the 
city. The projects used to be like 
fortresses for gangs, says Det. Ricky 
Pelletier. "Once you were inside,

immediately around the police 
station is known as the Jungle. It 
was once run by the Latin Kings, a 
national gang of mostly Latinos and 
Italians that began in the 1940s.

But by the late 1980s, a gang called 
the Jungle Boys, who lived in the 
Church Street South projects, had 
taken hold. "We'd come out for 
lineup in the morning and hear 
gunshots," Pelletier remembers. 
Pelletier 
has 
always 
been 
fascinated 
with 
Haven's 
gangs. He is a tough guy and looks 
it. He is hefty, well over 6 feet 
tall, with a blonde buzz cut and a 
small, thick blonde mustache that 
would make him look menacing 
if he didn't chuckle so often. He 
joined the NHPD in 1988. After



working briefly in patrol ("Not 
' 
enough action") and . the firearms 
and narcotics units ("I was dealing 
with the gangs on a regular basis"), 
he became the NHPD's de facto 
expert on the city's gangs and 
neighborhood rivalries. · 
Last year, the department finally 
created an official Gang Intelligence 
Unit, a collaboration among city, 
state, and federal police, as well as 
national government agencies such 
as the Drug Enforcement Agency 
(DEA), the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI), and the Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and 
Explosives (ATF). The new unit is 
part of NHPD's attempt to keep 
abreast . of the changing nature of 
gang violence in the city; Pelletier 
and his partner, Det. Mike Novella, 
were put in charge. 



They are aided in large part by

the city's new 
chief o£ police Frank Limon is a 30-
year veteran of the Chicago police 
force, in which he supervised 600 
people in the Organized Crime 
Unit's efforts to combat guns, 
drugs, and gangs in that city. 
Within days of taking office 
this past April, Limon _rolled but 
Operation Corridor, an effort to 
flood the city's most gang-ridden 
streets with enough police officers 
to stop the gunfire. But twenty 
years of gang 'history, and a city 
divided by rivalries that may run 
deeper than the gangs themselves, 
means that he has his work cut out 
for him.

In the past year or so, it has also 
become home to R2, also known 
as R2 BWE (Beef with Everybody) 
Black Flag, a gang that was linked 
to a spate of recent homicides 
and assaults. On the eastern edge 
of the city, a housing complex 
known as "the Island" overlooks 
the Quinnipiac River. It's the turf 
of the Island Brothers, a gang 
whose glory days, says Pelletier, 
have come and gone but who are 
still very much a presence on the 
streets near the river. Northwest of 
Yale's ca rnpus, the Tribe is nestled 
between the Ville to the north and 
the Tre to the west. The Tre is home 
to Kensington Street International 
(KSI), one of the tougher gangs 
from New Haven's worst days. 
Recently the Tre has also become 
home to Bloods and Crips from 
New York and New Jersey who 
have moved in to recruit new 
members.

when Pelletier joined _the NHPD, 
ranked 
arnong 
Ca rnden, N.J. and South Central 
Los Angeles as the most dangerous 
cities in America. "Traditionally, 
most of the crime was in the 
housing 
projects," 
explains. "When I carne on in '88, 
it was the Island Brothers, KSI, 
the Latin Kings, and the Jungle 
Boys that were running the show.

Each neighborhood has its own 
flavor and its own rivalries, but for 
They were mostly based out of the 
projects." During the late 1980s 
and early 1990s, drugs and the 
gangs that formed to deal them 
exploded on the city streets. · 
Up · until about 
1995, 
housing projects were insulated 
crime dens, a labyrinthine network 
of apattments within apartments, 
which could be taken over by a 
particular gang and used as a home 
base to stash guns and sell drugs. 
Gang members from other cities:-
the Latin Kings of New York, the 
Crips from Chicago-could drive 
into the city and disappear into 
their respective fortresses to drop 
off drugs or hide from police. The 
daily fights and shootings in the 
city were over drug turf; if you 
weren't a Jungle Boy and you tried 
to sell drugs around the Jungle, 
you were asking to get shot. 
When 
projects 
were 
redeveloped in the mid-1990s, 
they were remodeled into regular 
apartment-style buildings, getting

similar attributes: shootings in the 
years, there's been less fighting over 
which gang sells drugs on which 
corner. "The kids got smart that we 
were using undercover cops to bust 
them on street corners," Pelleteir 
explains. "So instead of standing 
on a corner and continuing to be 
a target, they would give a client 
a phone number and say, 'Call me 
up, I'll get you . what you need.' 
They'd set a meeting spot, drive to 
a dark place to make the exchange." 
Because of this, it is now easier, and 
arguably safer, than ever before to 
deal drugs in New Haven without 
getting arrested or jumped by a 
competing dealer. There's no need

The need for allegiance dies 
hard. When the national gangs of 
the 1980s and 1990s were shut 
down by the New Haven Gang 
Task Force, many of the major 
adult players in New Haven's crime 
scene were taken off the streets and 
incarcerated. They left behind a

na rne of the hood, hand signals or 
colors to signify membership. For 
exa rnple, members of the Crips 
and residents of the Ville both 
identify themselves with the color 
blue. 
Kathleen 
Edwards, 
supervisory 
prosecutor of the 
Juvenile Court in New Haven, 
says that just a few years ago, 
kids repped neighborhoods more 
often than they repped gangs. The 
juvenile offenders she prosecuted 
told her they identified themselves 
by where they lived in the city-
the Tre, the Tribe, the Ville. "The 
kids give themselves na rnes, maybe 
have a handshake or a symbol 
they identify with, but they're 
mostly 
identifying 
neighborhood," she explains. 
Now, the city's gangs are gaining 
national affiliation yet again. Over 
the last 18 months or so, says 
Pelletier, small sets with national 
reach have exploded across the 
city. "We do still have smaller 
street gangs, but everyone 
even 
those 
have taken on national 
affiliations." Most common are 
the sets of the Bloods, Crips, Latin 
Kings, and the Black Gangster 
Disciples, a national group with a 
heavy presence in Chicago. 
In addition to the shift from 
street-corner 
drug 
deals 
to

Pelletier ~redits technelogy with 
the change. "Before, kids might 
have wanted to call themselves the 
Bloods or the Crips but not really . 
understood 
what 
that 
meant. 
Now, they're picking up on the 
philosophy," says Pelletier. "We 
see it in interviews with kids. They 
can use the Internet, can Google 
the gang's philosophy, can connect 
with.an actual Grape Street Crip or 
a Blood from California. It's easier 
to pick up." 
In concert with these means of 
technological enlistment, 
adult 
Bloods from New York and New 
Jersey have moved to the Ville and 
the Tre, and are actively recruiting 
young new members.

West is one of the gang's new 
charges. She calls herself a "five-
fifty," just half a Blood. "We called 
five-fifties 'cause five is the five-
pointed star [a national Blood 
symbol], and fifty 'cause we only 
half down," she explains. Half 
down? "It means you rock wit' all 
Bloods and not Crips, but if your
