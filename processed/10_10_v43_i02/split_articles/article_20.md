was 
likely just 
following the .rules. In a recent 
raid carried out by Pelletier and 
Novella, NHPD seized two Blood 
handbooks, used to indoctrinate 
new members of the gang. The 
documents 
include 
an 
oath 
("Blooding is about respecting 
your farnily and doing what you 
could"), a prayer ("Will I ride, Yes 
. I'll ride, cause I bang with pride, 
.·.when I die bury me 5 feet up with 
red on me"), a pledge ("I pledge 
allegiance to he Blood flag and all 
my mill as in this nation"), and the 
rules of Stoney Face Milia, a subset 
of Bloods from the Ville. The rules 
form a code of conduct. Pelletier 
and the five-fifties say new Bloods 
have to memorize everything in the 
handbook so that they understand 
the philosophy of the fa rnily they 
are joining. The ·consequences 
of breaking the rules is stated 
dearly; "Rule No. 21: All 20 rules 
must Be enforced and followed, if 
caught Breaking any of these rules, 
you will Be terminated on site." 
· · Terminated, explains Williarns, 
means shot. 
Some of the rules seem practical: 
"Rule No. 4: No nastiness, 
meaning shower at least once a 
d " 
ay. 
"Rule 
No. 
2: 
No 
meaning no backbiting 
divi~e and conquer.'' 
treason, 
and no 
"Rule No. 9: Exercise, meaning 
work out your body, mind, and 
soul spiritually." 
Some are more threatening. 
Shaun, the Blood who shot his Crip 
brother, must have been following 
Rule No. 20: "No playing with 
the enemy, meaning if you see an 
enemy, tear his face off." 
Even Williarns and West, the 
two girls who call themselves 
half-Bloods, 
seem 
intimately 
fa rniliar with the rules, prayers, 
and symbols of the gang. While 
West talks about the friends she

has lost to gang violence, she

doodles 
their 
na rnes in red and black, the colors 
of the Bloods: "RIP · my fallen 
angels," she writes around pictures 
of five-pointed stars. "Nonnie, 
Brillhead, Moe-Milly, Lil Larry, 
Tank, Cornell." The letter "C" in 
"Cornell" is drawn with a slash 
through it, a visual disrespect to 
the Crips. The '.'B" in Brillhead is

dominance. 
These 
handwriting.trends are standard in 
Blood personal writings and graffiti 
across America; the same habits 
are visible in the handwritten 
Blood codes seized by NHPD. 
When Williams and West speak, 
they use Blood code words that 
are translated in the handbooks. 
Despite their half-status, these girls 
have absorbed too much of the 
national philosophy and dogma to 
be brushed aside as wannabes. 
"Will it Ever Go Away?" 
Whether 
Bloods 
are 
fighting Crips, or kids from the Tre 
are fighting kids from the Hill, the 
fact remains that kids believe it is 
more dangerous not to have a crew 
than to join a gang or rep a hood. 
Without backup, it can be hard 
to walk through other parts of the 
city. "If you walkin' in a place where 
you don't know people, the people 
from that hood gonna check you," 
says C.J. Pike, a scrawny' .13-year-
old-boy from the Ville. "They 
gonna surround you, ask you 
where you from, what you doin' in 
their hood, how long you gonna 
be there for." The kids who claim 
that hoods are likely to defend it 
against an outsider without a pack 
of friends alongside him. "If you 
don't say you gonna leave real soon, 
they make you leave." Two of Pike's 
friends got shot in broad daylight 
this year for walking in a hood 
that wasn't their own. Last year, 
-
Maurice '!ank'' Wilson, a college-
bound 17-year-old, was shot in the 
middle of winter, usually a calmer 
time. Wilson was lucky 
the shot 
wasn't fatal. 
· Even with luck, however, it's hard 
to avoid the system of violence. Kids 
are especially susceptible to gang 
affiliations if their blood relatives 
remain active. "I got a friend 
whose parents are both Crips, and 
her three older brothers are Crips," 
says Willia1ns. "She's an honors 
student." But she isn't a Crip, so 
"she had to move out the house, 
because her parents don't want 
nothin' to do with her." West and 
Willia 1ns both seem to understand 
that if parents show their children 
love and affection at an early age, 
the kids are more likely to stay 
off the streets. "The kids that got 
beaten when they was young, they 
the ones who's in the streets now," 
says Willia 1ns solemnly. "Give 
them respect instead of beating 
them. Take them out somewhere 
so they don't get bored and hang 
out with bad kids on the streets. 
' 
Show them love. Then they'll stay 
out the hood."

and her friends, the city needs 
to prevent the next generation 
of youth from stepping up and 
re-populating the major gangs.

such as Youth Rights Media, a 
nonprofit that teaches kids to

prevention. 
Your

meets 
weekday afternoons from 4:30 to 
7:30 p.m., the idle hours between 
school and curfew during which 
kids are most likely to commit 
crimes. The progra rn schedules 
activities to occupy kids during the 
prime hours of criminal activity, 
and gives kids creative outlets for 
emotions that might otherwise turn 
ugly. In addition to the counselors, 
school tutors, career specialists, 
and religious mentors. that Your 
Place provides, Jeuland schedules 
"superVised free time" -activities 
like karaoke and painting-for kids 
to express themselves in a way that 
adults can positively reinforce. 
"That might seem like it has 
nothing to do with gang violence, 
but every single one of 9ur kids has 
either seen a shooting, run away 
from a shooting, or lived their lives 
in fear of getting shot," says Jeuland. 
"Kids who have been traumatized 
like this, they're expecting people 
to give up on them, to tell them 
they're bad kids. To get up and sing 
in front of friends, and have adults 
cheer them on - it makes a world 
of difference. We've seen it." 
The schools are stepping up, too.

ar. 
Can the city actually keep its 
kids from shooting each other? 
Pike, for one, thinks the violence 
will extinguish itself if he just waits 
it out. "Probably by the time I'm 
24, there will be no more Bloods or 
Crips," he says. Why 24? "They'll 
all be in jail or dead by then." 
West disagrees. "Lockin' people 
up ain't gonna stop it," she says. 
"It will just get worse inside the

jails. You can't lock all the people 
up that's involved in this gang 
violence; its too many." 
And Pelletier plays the realist 
when discussing violence in New 
Haven. "Will it ever go away? I 
been working here for 20 years. I 
don't think you can ever stop it," 
he says. Of the violence, and the 
guns and drugs that come with it, 
he says, "It's like trash 
it never 
stops coming~ it's just a matter of 
taking it out. But if you don't. take 
out the trash, it's gonna pile up and 
be bad for everybody."
