For their part, consumers bring 
food home and forget about it in 
their refrigerators, . and restaurants 
throw 
out 
uneaten 
portions 
of meals. 
Unsurprisingly, 
the 
majority of food wasted is produce 
and dairy, which . spoil quickly. 
One 1987 University of Oregon 
study showed that most household 
food is thrown out because of 
misconceptions about perishable 
foods. Many people do not realize 
that milk .and other dairy products, 
unless obviously sour, can still be 
consumed after their expiration 
dates. 
Because of this, good food 
often goes to waste. According 
to the United States Department 
of Agriculture, in 1995, almost 
96 billion pounds of food-
27 percent of the year's edible 
food supply were lost at the 
farm, retail and consumer levels . . 
Although some was diseased or 
spoiled, a. significant percentage of 
food lost at the retail level was fit 
-
for distribution. 
Dumpster divers have no trouble 
finding food from all levels of the 
food pyra rnid, including meat, 
fresh produce, and dairy products. 
The food 
is 
often minimally 
da rnaged and needs only to be 
washed before being eaten. Shirley 
said he has never gotten sick from 
salvaged food. 
, 
If only five percent of the 96 
billion pounds of food wasted in 
1995 were recovered, the arnount 
would adequately feed 4 million 
people for one day. Food recovery 
prograrns 
across 
country 
seek to rectify this problem by 
redistributing leftover food, while 
businesses and restaurants have 
been implementing prograrns to 
reduce food waste for economic 
reasons. There are other stores, 
like Attic us in New Haven, that 
leave out their edible waste for the 
public to take . 
Many Yale 
students 
eagerly 
participate in events ~such as Spring 
Salvage or Eli Exchange, in which 
students trade clothing and other 
used items, but would never climb 
into a dumpster for the sarne 
items. Potential legal and health 
risks 
combined 
with 
personal 
standards for food intake may give 
many pause, but for those without 
those qualms, the choice is logical. 
As Frank explained: "I eat food. I 
know a place where I can get food 
that is free. It's going to be wasted 
otherwise. As long as [grocery 
stores] are being wasteful, I feel 
totally justified in taking advantage 
of their waste." 


**A Ride with Paul Hammer**
**Page number(s): 12**

e're pulling onto the main road. My driver 
carefully looks over his right shoulder to 
check for traffic. A minivan passes, and the middle-
aged, portly driver visibly snaps his neck around, 
craning to get a better look at us. The next driver 
does the sa rne. When the street is finally clear, we 
slip into the traffic headed down Orange Street, and 
we're off. 
I wish we were moving a little faster, because at 
. this pace it's hard to escape the stares of pedestrians 
. and drivers alike. Riding in a pedicab is more 
·conspicuous than I had anticipated in the everyday · 
street scene of New Haven. 
My driver has no such worries. He grins widely 
at each of our spectators, calling out, "You set the 
fare! We'll take you almost anywhere!" This is an 
exhibition for him, a chance to perform as much as 
advertise. As we maneuver through the thick Friday 
afternoon traffic, he gets almost as many waves as 
befuddled stares. 
"You seem to know a lot of faces," I comment. 
"Well 
they know me," he laughs. 
*** 
It has only been two weeks since Paul Harnmer 
launched his new pedicab company, but he's 
already made his mark. His signature helmet can be 
spotted from blocks away 
it's bright purple, with a 
multicolored mini-umbrella attached to the top. He 
explains that the helmet, like many parts· of his life, 
melds his two great loves: bicycling and dra rna. 
"With a side order of social justice and activism," 
he adds, breaking into a grin, his mustache bristles 
curving upwards. 
· 
The eccentric headgear may be one reason so 
many people recognize Ha rnmer on our ride, but 
it's certainly not the only one; he identifies some of 
the folks waving as being acquaintances from New 
Haven's art world and volunteer scene. Harnmer 
wears many hats (not all of them purple) in this 
city, but beneath them all is the sa rne jovial smile, 
the san1e clipped bristly mustache, and the san1e 
energetic ctttzen. 
Harnmer is not just a pedicab driver. He is the 
founder of a nonprofit that puts kids on bikes, a 
playwright, an active participant in community 
theater, and a volunteer at numerous community 
service groups across the city, from the Integrated 
Refugee Immigrant Services (IRIS) to the National 
Association of Mental Illness. Ha nuner seems to be 
everywhere 
a staple of the community.

Looking at Hammer's resume, it's easy to forget 
that, for him, service is as much personal therapy 
as it is a fight on behalf of local refugees or 
underprivileged kids. Years ago, he was diagnosed 
with bipolar disorder, and in 2004, he tells me, 
"I made the cover of the New Haven Register." A 
pause. "By jumping off of East Rock." 
The attention his suicide attempt garnered forced 
Hatnmer to grapple with his bipolar disorder. And 
six years later, though he is still in recovery from 
·brain injuries sustained from his fall, he can smile a 
watery grin and joke about starting a support group, 
"The Bi-Polar Bears." 
. "My commitment to working with others ... 
• That is definitely a difference in my focus since 
· God spared my life." And he remains grateful. As 
he considers the incident six years ago, his eyes are 
tinged with red, and he tears up. "I than,t<: God every 
day that I'm alive. I always wear my helmet." 
Harnmer can remember his first bike ride 
he's 
glad he was wearing a helmet, then, too. His first 
time riding, as a child in New York City, Ha rnmer 
drove straight through a sprinkler. He went flying 
over the bicycle seat and was soaked through. 
Undeterred, however, he bounced back and spent 
much of his childhood biking around Central Park, 
taking in the puppeteers and Shakespeare in the Park 
and the zoo. 
. At 14, Harnmer embarked on his first cycling 
tour around the northeast, pedaling between youth 
hostels, where he met people from all over the 
world. 
"I'd never experienced that," he explains. 
"Bicycling takes you places 
literally." 
Today, we ride past the Green, Old Carnpus just 
visible across the way. Ha rnmer has known and 
loved these streets since he moved to the city years 
ago. After graduating from Wesleyan University, 
Harnmer picked New Haven as his next residence 
because it was near both Boston and New York, 
where many of his Wesleyan classmates were headed. 
As he immersed himself in the local community 
theater scene, worked in the Yale Law School coding 
investigations, and volunteered at a senior citizen · · · 
theater company, Ha rnmer stumbled upon the Yale 
School of Management. 
"I applied on a lark and on a dare," he reminisces
