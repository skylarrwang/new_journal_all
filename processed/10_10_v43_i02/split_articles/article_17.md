guys with whom to become friends 
with. Two of his online friends 
just started a business together, 
but there's a lot of testosterone. "If 
you win," he writes in an e:-mail, 
"you feel like you've proven your 
masculinity. If you lose, you feel 
like you aren't good enough." 
If you kill an enemy, there's a 
sexualized "tea-bagging" custom in 
which you "crouch on [the corpse] 
repeatedly." A lot of the players, he

Norberg, who is straight, sees this 
belittling as an attempt to affirm

Norberg likes public health and 
sex. He is on the board of directors 
of Sex Week at Yale. He also has a 
radio show on

explanatory. But because there's no 
such thing as too much sex talk, 
Norberg signed up for this class.

a magazine slated to launch next

related issues, and he_ answers my

''As a ,gay male," he says, "you come 
up against a tension between your 
sexual identity and your gender 
on a daily basis. It's something 
that's inevitable because of the 
historic association between gay 
men and effeminacy." Jake is far 
from effeminate.· He has a more 
forceful presence on- the phone 
than most people have in person. 
He's big and tall, he works out a 
lot, and he played sports in high 
school. At gay bars, people ask him 
if he's straight. He's "one hundred

There's no single aspect of his

at Yale have had an impact, but "it's

More broadly, Conway explains 
that there's no single trope of 
masculinity 
at 
Yale 
"there's 
no such thing as a 'Yale Man."' 
Although definitions of masculinity 
vary widely among a diverse 
student body, Conway still notices 
an ideal of hegemonic, white, 
and heterosexual masculinity that 
affects "all of our social inter-
relationships and how we perceive 
ourselves." Yale's atmosphere, he 
comments, remains "elitist and 
takes as its sort of archetype the 
white elite." Conway says he agrees 
with Judith Butler, a 20th century-
American 
philosopher 
who 
posited that gender 
archetypal or 
~ 
otherwise 
is "performative." 
VanDusen has certainly noticed a 
certain performance of masculinity 
at Yale. A freshman, he has spent 
the last six weeks meeting and 
greeting. He says many guys he 
meets "will totally let you know 
what they're good at, what they're 
great at, what they've accomplished, 
in a much more forward way than 
I'm used to." People didn't brag so 
much where he's from. Here, "it's 
very in your face 
the kind of 
backhanded, 'Yeah, it's difficult for 
Harry Vandusen '14 
me to be in this French class 'cause, 
you know, I speak so fluently and 
a lot of them can't converse with 
me.'" He sounds fed up. "These are 
conversations I've actually had." 
He thinks the bragging is an 
expression of masculinity. And he 
also seems to think it's a form of 
overcompensation: "The people 
who don't talk about what they've 
done. Once you pry a little, they're 
the most impressive ones." This 
view is aligned with what VanDusen 
identifies as a theme of the course: 
if you fall short with respect to one 
aspect of your masculinity, you 
tend to "exert it by showing off 
other accomplishments." 
At Saltarelli's high school, in 
Orange County, Calif. ("notable 
for its 
many sex 
scandals!"), 
masculinity is another "ridiculous 
performance" 
what 
Saltarelli 
calls the "performative bro thing." . 
The popular guys were "really 
athletic, kind of outrageous and 
funny, kind of douchey." Like 
VanDusen, when Saltarelli carne to 
Yale, he was able to realize about 
his hometown that "it's not like 
that everywhere." But most places 
he goes, Saltarelli sti 1 notices a

quality of performance in the 
actions of males. 
And at Yale, there are a lot of 
performers. When I ask him to 
define 
masculinity within 
his 
· improv comedy group, the Viola 
Question, Saltarelli describes a 
quality of affability: "the ability to 
behave respectfully and amicably 
with all kinds of people." Funnily 
enough, this kind of masculinity 
doesn't seem gender-specific at all. 
Ramirez, also active in the theater 
community, sees masculinity in his 
crowd as a way of "acting, and 
carrying yourself" 
either showy 
or nonchalant. "The more laid-
back ones," like Ramirez, hang out 
backstage. "The more out-there 
people," he says, "are the ones who 
perform. There are a lot of really 
out-there people who do really 
crazy things. Everyone loves it. A 
lot of them are my friends. They're 
just silly, all the time." Is that really 
an 
expression . of . masculinity?

Rarnirez has observed that 
his classmates also display their 
masculinity in different ways: 
· "There are guys that are really 
flarnboyant and others that are 
extremely chill, really laid-back, 
just like, 'I don't care."' 
"Sometimes," Ramirez says, "I 
just want to be laid back, and not 
really care about what I look like." 
Today he's wearing corduroys, 
checkered Vans, and a pullover· 
hoodie. It's chill. But, he says, 
"sometimes I care a lot, and I'll 
go crazy and dress up." He pauses. 
"Sometimes I just feel like dressing

When Reid walks into class one 
Wednesday, everyone is already 
24 
seated, unpacked, and chatting. 
By the time he gets to the front 
of the room, the class' attention is 
on him. Reid is small, with silver 
hair and a tastefully trimmed 
beard. This afternoon, he's wearing 
black, pinstriped pants, a light 
blue button down with a few 
buttons open, and dress shoes. He 
enunciates every word and waves 
his hands as he speaks. The accent 
of his English is falniliar, but I 
can't put my finger on the place of 
origin. Not the UK, not Australia ... 
South Mrica. Growing up there, 
Reid explains, he faced "fairly rigid 
ideas about masculinity," and had 
. the experience of "completely not 
fitting within those norms." After 
getting his doctorate in queer 
studies from . the University of 
Amsterda 1 n, Reid returned to South 
Mrica to conduct field research. 
There, in the rural areas where he 
researched queer identities, "people 
think of themselves as ladies or 
gents," regardless of their biological 
gender . . Gay .men are like ladies, 
"gay l-adies" 
so hyper-masculine 
straight men, who often have wives 
or girlfriends, have sex with them 
and "don't see it as contradictory to 
their heterosexual identity." These 
kinds of discoveries made Reid 
think about not only what it means 
to be gay or straight, but also what 
it means simply to be a man. 
Maleness as a scholarly subject 
is fairly novel. Reid's course is 
the only one about masculinity 
in his department, which began 
as Women's Studies, and then 
broadened, 
becoming 
first 
Women's and Gender Studies 
and finally Women's, Gender, and 
Sexuality Studies, reflecting the 
evolution of the field. Women's 
studies departments at universities 
were born from the feminist 
movement, in which masculinity 
was thought of as "the problem 
and the enemy," Reid says. But as 
he writes in the syllabus, multiple 
factors, including the "sociological 
enquiry into the changing nature of 
work and farnily," have yielded an 
intense new focus on the changing 
roles of men and masculinity in 
SOCiety. 
"If you fall short with 
respect to one 
aspect of your . 
masculinity, you tend 
•• 
· to "exert it by · -~ 
showin.g off other

There's 
no doubt that old-
fashioned 
is 
still 
kicking. At the beginning of 
Wednesday's class, Yi 
gives a 
presentation 
on Tucker 
Max, 
author of "I Hope They Serve Beer 
in Hell." 
"Tucker Max," he reads from 
his opening slide "Hegemonic 
Male or General Douchebag? Or 
both?" (Yi likes to think Max is 
a combination of the two.) At 
first, the class is a rnused as Yi lists 
notable events in the life of the 
self-described "raging dickhead," 
who "gets excessively drunk at 
inappropriate times" and "sleeps 
with more women than is safe or 
reasonable." By the time Yi reveals 
that, in 2009, American popular··
