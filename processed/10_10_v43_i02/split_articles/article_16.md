Ron claims that ·for his own first 
tattoo in Duck's studio, a whole 
host 
of 
people 
employees, 
• 
friends, passers-by 
were invited 
one by one to attack his raw arm. 
"They were beating me with two-
by-fours," he jokes. 
Finally, 
Nicole 
is 
finished. 
''Alrighty 
m'dear," 
says 
Duck, 
lowering the pneumatic chair. 
"Let's bring you back down to 
earth." 


Just before I met Duck, I'd been 
thinking in the most distant, 
hypothetical way 
about getting 
a tattoo mysel£ 
Before then I'd 
never considered doing so any 
more than I'd considered throwing 
myself at a brick wall or going 
at my leg with a staple gun. But 
some little thrill-hungry imp over 
my shoulder got the notion that 
submitting to the needle would 
. make a perfect finale for this 
piece: Squea rnish young academic 
finally gets inked! 
I brought up 
the idea on a fa•nily reunion· in 
Virginia, and was met with a earful 
of disapproval. "Oooh," said my 
mother, making a face and trying 
to think of a constructive way to 
fra•ne her extrel!le disgust with the 
suggestion. My sister chimed in: 
"If you want to see what it feels 
like, I can just stick a pin in your 
arm." Immediately I started feeling 
woozy and decided there was no 
way I could man up enough to do 
it 
the issue became moot. 
But 
then, 
watching 
Duck 
complete 
a 
progression 
increasingly 
involved 
tattoos 
(including one, in neon green; on a 
particularly copious bleeder whose 
girlfriend kept opening his ink-
and-blood-soaked paper 
towels 
and asking him to read them like 
Rorschach blots), I built up a level 
of squeam-tolerance I'd 
never 
thought possible. 
I floated the 
idea to my mother one more time 
during a late-night phone call. She 
raised a point I'd largely forgotten 
in all my focus on the gory aspects: 
Whatever design I got would be 
there forever. 


I tried to think of something that 
I'd want engraved permanently 
onto my body . 
A Celtic cross? No, I'd been to 
church twice in as many years, 
and I consider myself Irish only 
for about a one-hour period every 
Saint Patrick's Day. 
Something writerly? 
Pen and 
ink or some such? Naw, I haven't 
really decided on a career, and how 
stupid would that crap look in law 
school? 
A pretty tree or a bird would look 
nice, but not nice enough to justify 
the sidelong glances from potential 
bosses and mothers-in-law . 
That night, I found myself 
tossing and turning in bed, my 
squeamishness back in full force. 
My bare skin felt electric and I 
registered every point of contact 
between my body and the -sheets 
with painful sensitivity. I couldn't 
stop imagining needles gliding 
over every uncovered inch. 
Before I finally drifted off, I 
had a wild tho'ught ~ . , Maybe ~y 
rejuvenated fear wasn't about sharp 
objects, wasn't connected tofragile 
skin and oozing. drops ~( blood. 
Maybe 1t was a more fund'ament;u 
worry, a writer's fear: the sense that 
given pen and ink and· the most 
precious canvas of all~ I would 
have nothing· wort~ while ·to say. 
Nothing for which fd 'be ready to 
hurt.

is outstandingly 
handsome and robust; very 
masculine. 

This is The American ·Heritage 
Dictionarys 
exa•I1ple 
sentence 
for the word "masculine." It's the 
kind of s.entence that's intended 
to elucidate, to enlighten. It's the 
kind your high school .English 
teacher makes you write on tests to 
prove, beyond a shadow of doubt, 
that you know the meaning of the 
word. Masculine equals handsome 
plus robust~ Outstandingly so. 
: Does 
America 
really 
define 
masculinity this way? Does Yale? 
_Every Wednesday afternoon, in . 
a well-lit basement classroom in 
Rosenkranz Hall, 20 Yalies and a 
professor, Graeme Reid, attempt . 
to answer these questions and 
more. The course, offered by the 
Women's, Gender, and Sexuality 
Studies 
department, 
"Men, 
Manhood, and Masculinity." The 
13 women and seven men enrolled 
:were · chosen from · some . 100 
applicants. 

They have their wo.rk cut out 
for them. A national conversation 
has emerged, one that suggests 
masculinity is in . crisis. 
The 
Atlantic ran a cover _story . called 
"The End of Men," citing the new 
female majority in the workforce 
as a defining shift. In October~ 
Newsweek featured a piece called 
" 
· UP! The Traditional Male 
is an Endangered Species. It's Time 
to Re~hink Masculinity." And now, 
Yale is offering a course on what it 
nieans to be a man. 
Max Saltarelli '13 saw the course 
description and thought, "Men, 
manhood, 
masculinity? 
That 
sOunds really cool! I'm a male! So 
maybe I would_ know a thing or 
two about men!" 
His interest in the course 
is personal. Saltarelli came out · For his part, John Yi '12 wanted 
as gay about a mo~th into · his 
to take something different. He 
freshman 'year. His parents, he says, 
had taken 24 credits in his first two 
are each from different generat_ions 
(his father is .older); and they had 
different ideas about raising a 
son. His mother· was "loving and 
sheltering," indulging his whims-
like when he just had to have that 
pair of jelly shoes-in preschool, or 
when he wanted to be the. Pink 
Power Ranger for Halloween. 
His father "envisioned it in a 
more '50s sort of way'' than his 
mothec He wanted his son to go · 
fishing, or throw a football around, 
or "get really into basketball." 
L?-ughing, Saltarelli tells ·me ·that 
he didn't .quite fit the mold. His 
years, all in the math, economics, 
and music departments. When 
he· saw "Men, Manhood, and 
Masculinity" in the Blue Book, 
he thought, "Those are the sarne 
questions that I think about every 
d 
ay. 
Yi lights up when he talks 
about his three sisters 
one's his 
twin, and the others are a couple 
of years older. They "happen to 
be the most beautiful, talented, 
amazing, 
empowenng women 
he knows. ("One of them went to 
Wellesley 
she like, wanted to go 
to Wellesley.") Growing up, John 
and his sisters were inseparable. 
They took gymnastics and dance 
classes together 
he even joined 
them at the salon for haircuts. 
They were best friends. He says 
he never realized that "there really 
is a power dyna 1nic between boys 
and girls" in much of society. His 
mother owned a small business; 
she was the breadwinner and head 
of the household. "It was always 
'Ma•na Yi and her four kids,"' he 
chuckles. When Yi ca 1ne to Yale, 
the combination of living with 
m·en for the first time and coming 
out as gay made him ask, "Holy 
s--t, what is masculinity? What 
does it mean to be a guy?" 
childhood was marked by a series 
of botched attempts at Little · 
League. Then there was "a brief 
basketball thing. 
Literally one 
practice." MaX. puts on a gruff voice 
to imitate his father.- "He should 
be outside playing football!" The 
imitation is lighthearted, . but he 
does remember feeling "kind of 
sad." Did his mother care that he 
didn't play sports? "Not at all." 
Unlike some of his classmates, 
Saltarelli wants to be there not 
because he has thought so much 
about 
the 
issues 
course 
addresses 
but rather he feels he 
hasn't thought about them enough. 
In any case, he "semi-took it on a 
whim." 
As the students of WGSS 304 
have discovered, the answer varies 
from place to place and across 
conununities. Harry VanDusen 
~ 14 is from Lynnfield, Mass., a · 
small town settled in 1638. He 
describes the idea of masculinity 
there as "traditional." Back home, 
a man was expected to be "tough, 
a tough guy" 
stoic, physically 
and emotionally. When I ask if 
there were any openly gay rnen in
