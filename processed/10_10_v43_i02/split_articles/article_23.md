·A 'been-there' guide for the cash-strapped interior decorator:

There are some great things about shopping in traditional stores: the consistency of selection and pricing; the choice to pay by cash, 
credit, check, or coupon; that warm sense of security you get approaching the register, confident in a safe transaction. 
You know the 
feeling, you've walked those aisles. But especially for broke college kids, getting a good deal trumps all safety standards and concerns about 
comfort. Enter Craigslist.

Yes, the Craigslist. That seedy bounty of the Internet. That cornucopia of all things cheap and/ or stolen. It is the perfect r~source for 
today's frugal consumer 
the ideal alternative when Salvo's selection turns up too chic. 
For the uninitiated, Craigslist is an online classifieds database, started by Craig Newberg in 1995, that now ranks among the top 
ten most visited sites in America. The model is genius: a unique intersection between commerce and gambling where the rush of eBay 
meets the creep of ChatRoullete. Where every purchase is weighed against the probability of being swindled, and "cash only" payments 
. sometimes mean organs too. Where men and women, minors and geriatrics come together to buy, sell, defraud, and bamboozle . 
My own foray into the mysterious world of Craigslist took me on tour of the Connecticut underground, and exposed me to a teeming 
economy, sheltered behind the anonymity oflnternet pseudonym. First, there was Frank the 'bike dealer' in East Haven, whose one-room 
apartment offered an unusually diverse assortment of Cannondale bicycles for suspiciously low rates. Fearing criminal consequences, I 
instead turned to Dave, who seemed slightly more legal when we met at 6 a.m. on Crown Street. Soon to follow was Liza, a lovely little 
chain-smoker from Branford &om whom I bought a $30 sofa. In introducing the couch to my common room, I suspect I may have also 
introduced invasive parasites into the larger Davenport community. When all was said and done, however, I emerged with a great bike, 
• . 
a comfortable couch, and both of my kidneys. Not a bad deal. 
Takeaway Points: 
-A lot of ads will say "no e-mails"... Nobody likes a paper trail. 
-Leather is almost never leather . 
-Delivery is pretty much impossible. 
-Bedbugs can make a grown man tremble.
