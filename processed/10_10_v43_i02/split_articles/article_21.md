thing to do in my home-
, 
town, if it was a weekend 
and you weren't old enough to 
drive, was a movie at the local mall. 
You might grab a slice of pizza first; 
but in any case, you needed a ride. 
Usually, the responsibility for my 
friends and me fell to Julia's dad, 
a quiet guy with a moustache and 
thick glasses. Over the course of 
many 10-minute drives, he be-
came privy to all the conspiracy 
theories and crushes that plague 
14-year-old girls. It never occurred 
to us that he could hear from the 
front seat. 


Three years later, if any-
one's dad had suggested driving us 
to prom, we would have been mor-
tified. There were times and places 
for our dads and their cars 
and 
far fewer of them, as soon as we 
learned how to drive ourselves. 
Then, we could come and go as 
we pleased. I kept the garage-door 
opener for my dad's house in the 
console of my car, its shape distinc-
tive enough to find by fishing in 
the pile of loose receipts and CDs. 
Now, travel, by car or otherwise, 
with either parent leaves me nos-
talgic. This summer, when I flew to 
Arizona for a week of hiking with 
my dad, he held my boarding pass 
as he had when I was 10. When 
it was time to return from Grand 
Canyon National Park to the air-
port in Phoenix, he drove us across 
the state in a rental car whose cu-
pholders we filled with trail mix. 
I put my feet up on the dash and 
napped. Later in the summer, as 
we took out our boots for a hike, 
my dad would turn to me and say, · 
that's Grand Canyon dust. 


Because its terrain varies so much 
in elevation, Arizona is home to 
at least six biomes. My dad and I 
drove through desert scrub, where 
Saguaro cactuses stand like traffic 
cops. We drove through charpar-
ral, long plains studded with low 
bushes and houses visible miles be-
fore we reached them. Higher up, 
we drove through forests of fir and 
pine. It was like driving across the 
world. 


I inherit two things from my 
dad: driving, and insomnia. On 
my 16th birthday, he surprised 
me by pulling around the car after 
breakfast and telling me to get in. 
I was terrified. He made me drive 
to a nearby parking lot and back. 
That year, before I was ready to try 
my mother's manual-transmission 
car, teaching me to drive was my 
dad's job. We made time for lessons 
when I was at his place. Our long 
Sunday drives traced tree-shaded 
roads in rural western Connecti-
cut, qut past the spot on the river 
where people go tubing. 


"Lots of stupid and untalented 
people make perfectly good driv-
ers," my dad reassured me, when I 
despaired of ever learning how to 
drive. "Anyone can drive." When 
I attempted parallel parking, he'd 
recite Woody Allen: "It's OK, I can 
walk to the curb from here." 


Now, both of us can drive, but 
neither of us has ever been able to 
sleep. I stay up too late, and my 
dad wakes up too early. When I 
was 12 and my parents separated, 
my dad wouldn't give me the base-
ment room at his house, because it 
was two flights of stairs away from 
his, and he didn't want me to be 
lonely or to have trouble falling 
asleep. 


When I was very young, my dad 
would wrap me in coats and put 
me in the car and drive me all over 
town until the rhythm of wheels 
on road put me to sleep. The year I 
was six and afraid of fireworks, he 
did this on the fourth of July, being 
careful to avoid the routes closest 
to the shows' noise. 


In Arizona, my dad and I drove all 
day and night into Flagstaff, 
"World's First International Dark 
Sky City''; out of Flagstaff, down a 
stretch of highway adopted by the 
Flagstaff Optimists' Club, and 
another by the Baha'i Faith. We 
drove in the direction of the San 
Francisco Peaks. Massive, white-
capped, the range would be cele-
brated in any other state, but in 
Grand Canyon country, it's given 
short shrift. We drove into Sedona 
at sunset, when its red rocks glow 
like heat lamps. "Crystal Castles 
Metaphysical Department Store," 
said a sign there. Late, we saw signs 
for a river called Big Bug Creek and 
a town named Bumble Bee. 


In the middle of nowhere, be-
fore we got to Phoenix, my dad 
pulled off the road. "I'm going to 
close my eyes for just a minute," 
he said. "And when I awake, you 
can remind me to tell you the story 
of the Death Valley real estate op-
portunity." On the road there was 
time for stories. My dad, being my 
dad, knows everything about me, 
but I hadn't known why he didn't 
serve in Vietnam (his December 
birthday was late in the lottery) or 
the five American cities he would 
choose to show a tourist (Seattle 
made his list). My dad believes 
that Oreos and oranges are the 
best snacks for hiking, and that 
Gatorade is important. My dad's 
ex-girlfriend was not a good travel 
companion, too fussy, but my dad 
told me I am good to travel with, 
because I'm always game. 


My dad and I were still an hour 
out of Phoenix when we saw six 
javelinas, hairy Southwestern pigs, 
in the light of our headlights. By 
this time of night, long stretches 
of highway were empty except for 
the pigs. We waited for them to 
nose their way across the road and 
then pulled off for gas. Besides 
Coke and cigarettes, the conve-
nience store sold antiques, mari-
juana paraphernalia, and a broad 
array of magazines. Outside, a 
sign on the door reads, "100s OF 
KNIVES." 


Let's stop and poke around, I 
suggested. Why not, said my dad, 
resigned, laughing. It was so late 
already. Together, we peered at the 
weirdest merchandise. Behind the 
counter stood a greasy-haired teen-
age boy and, next to him, some-
thing labeled "Fully Functional 
Umbrella/Sword $36.99." 


We paid for our drinks and got 
back in the car. We were flying out 
of Phoenix the next day, very early. 
We were going to use our hotel 
room there for four, maybe five, 
hours of sleep. "If I was your age," 
my dad told me, "I would just 
sleep in the car. Cancel the hotel 
room." 


"Let's do it!" I said, but he shook 
his head and drove on. There was 
a difference between being 20 and 
your daughter being 20. He wasn't 
about to let me sleep on the side of 
the road. 


When we got to the hotel in 
Phoenix, the desert night was still 
warm. It took us a few minutes to 
find parking—desperate minutes: 
we couldn't believe that after such 
a long drive, there was going to be 
no parking at the end. Toting duffel 
bags, we spilled into the fluores-
cent lobby, where there were two 
men dressed business-casual with 
two women whose short skirts, 
high heels, and makeup were all 
wrong. I had never seen prosti-
tutes before. We went upstairs to 
our room, and I spent some time 
on the balcony, green light drift-
ing up from the hotel pool, as my 
dad inside tried to sleep. The next 
morning, we turned in the rental 
and flew home. 


Back home, late in the summer, 
my dad and I were in the car again, 
and he remembers the story of the 
thousand frogs. He had never told 
me this story before. One night 
when I was two, he was driving 
me down an empty road in New 
Hampshire, after a rainstorm. He 
was trying to help me fall asleep. 
The road was wet and slick, and 
the frogs were out because of the 
weather. There were thousands of 
them, my dad told me, hopping 
all over the road. He must have 
crushed dozens of frogs as I slept 
in the passenger seat, the road rib-
boned beneath us, and he drove 
me, smoothly, on and on into the 
night.
