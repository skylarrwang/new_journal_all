Yet Whalley and Goffe's reprieve 
is short-lived. The king of England 
renews the orders for their capture, 
and Massachusetts issues another 
warrant for their arrest. "Kirk and 
Kelland, two zealous royalists" 
(as Brackett describes them in his 
poem) leave Boston to ferret the 
two fugitives out. Whalley and 
Goffe lay a false trail to Milford and 
return to New Haven to hide in 
the Rev. John Davenport's house. 
Aware of the increasingly severe 
threats to Davenport, Whalley 
and Goffe nobly ·resolve to turn 
themselves in and then settle on 
another plan of action: gypsy life. 
OCTOBER 2010 
With the help of one Mr. Jones, the 
former pair bounce from a barn, to 
a mill, to the woods (reportedly, 
they hide under a bridge as their 
pursuers crossed on horseback), 
before arriving at the modern-day 
historical site of Judges' Cave here 
in -New Haven. While Kirk and 
Kellond are ·utterly hoodwinked 
and travel to the Dutch colony of 
New Amsterdarn (now New York 
City) before returning to Boston, 
Native American hunters discover 
our heroes' humble dwelling at the 
remote West Rock location and 
report the two beleaguered rebels 
in 1664. 
From there, Whalley and Gaffe 
flee Judges' Cave to Hadley, Mass., 
where they are briefly reunited 
with Dixwell. He eventually parts ·· 
for New Haven, where he takes 
the name of John Davis, marries, 
and has two children. Whalley and 
Goffe, unknown to the majority of 
the Hadley's residents, remain in 
the minister's house for the next 
15 or 16 years. Whalley dies first, 
and Gaffe perhaps travels south 
afterward (some swear he was seen 
in Hartford). Their resting places 
are unknown.

Though he didn't know this 
mysterious end to 
the story, 
Zelinsky's 
relationship 
to. the 
three judges took on its own 
legendary spin this summer when 
he interned at Parlia anent. While 
on a palace tour, he encountered 
Charles' death warrant in the 
Queen's Robing Room, displayed 
on an old piece of parchment. The 
54 signautres on the docurnent 
include Whalley's, Goffe's, and 
Dixwell's. "Whalley is actually very 
early on and you notice it when 
you look at the death warrant." 
He is fourth, to be precise, right 
under Cromwell, his name, like 
the others, accompanied by a seal 
of red wax. 
An ocean . away and centuries 
later, it is green and white paint, 
and metal poles that bear the 
heroes' 
na rnes 
our 
industrial 
tribute to a revolutionary past.
