They come to Yale, these people, to learn and to meet people. They come with varying degrees of self-awareness, but usually they see themselves as whole human beings: whole feminine human beings. And that is where the trouble begins; for these people are women in the Graduate School at Yale.


It does not take long for the campus to become familiar to them; but, at the same time, they remain aware of something strange. In the natural loneliness of the first few weeks it is hard to distinguish feelings, but soon the disease becomes apparent. They are becoming bods--bods to be stared at, bods to be evaluated, bods to be fantasized about, bods for the Yalies to visually screw. For some, for a while, it is exciting to be so appreciated. For others, right away, it is repulsive. For all, sooner or later, it is dehumanizing, desexualizing and a drag. No matter what they may be like as people, at Yale they stand out. The averted eyes or the grilling stare make them aware that somehow they don't really belong.


As they sit through their seminars, they experience a different strain. The first few times it isn't clear why they are so often put down. The more they talk knowledgeably or perceptively, the clearer it becomes. They are becoming impersonalized female minds-minds to be tested, minds to be dissected, minds to be proved inferior, minds for the graduate men to mentally rape. For some, for a while, it is challenging and stimulating. For others, right away, it is demoralizing. For all, sooner or later, it is dehumanizing, desexualizing and a drag.


To be criticized, as they are by graduate men, for being unfeminine and frigid is brutal when they are being prodded to be hard-nosed, competitive minds in class. Kenneth Kenniston, a professor of psychiatry at Yale, says: "Yale is a magnet for men who don't really want to be around women. Put these men in the same school as women who resent the renunciation that graduate school involves anyway, and you have a pretty tense situation." The damned-if-you-are, damned-if-you're-not atmosphere in the Graduate School makes women aware that somehow they do not really belong.


They begin their academic program with the faculty. After several sessions of discussing ideas, they become aware of a different tension. Gradually they begin to understand that they are becoming precocious psyches-psyches to be patronized, to be dominated, to be professionalized-psyches for the faculty to prostitute. For a while it is an ego trip. Ultimately it is a down.


They are expected to prove their competence as scholars while assuming that this has no relation to their personalities or lives as women. The more they conform to the grad-grind syndrome, the easier the tensions become. But if they are spirited, involved or not career oriented, they become aware that, somehow, they do not realy belong. After a couple of years, many of them (60%) drop out.


But the real question is: Why are women so disruptive? Why should they be so raptly attended as bodies, minds and careers and so consistently ignored as persons? Why must they constantly prove themselves competent sexually, mentally and professionally? Haven't they declared time and again that this is a good thing?


Maybe all these women are just paranoid. Yet is it paranoid to cringe when you walk into Hungry Charley's on a Saturday night only to be asked if you are enjoying the mixer? Is it paranoid to go to an art film and be nauseated by the whistles, hisses, ooo's and woo's of the Yalies when a woman's body is exposed? Is it paranoid to wonder at the overwhelming admisison of single graduate males that they never even considered how many women would be at Yale when they applied? Is it paranoid to feel that Yale is hypocritical when they allow women into their school while classifying gynecological problems as "special" medical problems? And is it paranoid to be dismayed when a professor asks if you are sure you want to go through with your degree because you expressed a concern about the academic, personal and social problems at Yale and in New Haven?


The women who come to Yale are not just male minds in female bodies. They are not unfeminine intellects trying to make it in a man's world. They are women in all that makes women different and unique. For all the talk that is going around about feminine mystiques it is amazing that all the difference Yale acknowledges between men and women is the sexual one.


It might be worth while to consider some of the differences in modes of think-
