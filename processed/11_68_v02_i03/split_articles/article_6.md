EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
I spent a month this summer in Cuba and 
kept a daily journal, mostly transcriptions 
of conversation. What follow are some 
excerpts from that journal. I traveled wide-
ly about the island, talking with all sorts of 
people. The extraordinary impression they 
aU gave me was one of a revolution in 
progress. Even after almost ten years, the 
atmosphere in Cuba is charged with a 
sense of newness and change. I owe a debt 
of thanks to my Cuban friends for their 
willingness to let me do as I pleased and 
their efforts to let me see and do what I 
wanted virtually without restriction. I hope 
readers can capture for themselves here 
something of what it is like in Cuba today. 
Thanks too to Anne Jones of Radcliffe, 
whom I met in Mexico as we were leaving 
for Havana and who has aided my recol-
lections from time to time. 

Waiting in the Mexico City airport for 
the Cubana flight, Anne and I met a 
motherly Cuban who works for a pub-
lishing house in Havana. She was in 
Mexico to visit her grandchildren. She 
told us stories of Fidel ("Ay, Fidel, what a 
maivelous boy!") and complained about 
conditions in the airport. 
"It's just shameful the way they take 
your pictures here, as if you were some sort 
of criminal. For heaven's sake, they caU 
Cuba a police state, and look what they do 
to you here! It makes a person nervous. I 
just won't feel calm until we're on that 
plane. Thank goodness that sort of thing 
doesn't go on in Cuba." 

Walter Wagoner, Jr., is a second-year stu-
dent at the Yale Law School. 
"You know, it makes a person so mad. 
Why, here they are in Mexico having all 
these problems with the students, and what 
do they start saying? 'Castro-Commu-
nists!' That's all they think about. Why, the 
papers talk as if we were running around 
here stirring everything up. They should 
have a little more sense; these young peo-
ple have their own problems; we certainly 
don't have to get involved. This is a very 
strange country!" 

We boarded a Russian airliner for the 
three-hour flight. The food was great, the 
best I've ever bad on a plane. Our Cuban 
lady friend kept urging us to eat on. "Of 
course they'll say that the Cubans are all 
starving to death. Well, you'll see soon 
enough." She rubbed her stomach and 
winked. 

We were met at the Jose Mart( Airport 
by several young people working for the 
Cuban Tourist Agency. We were nervous, 
still; they gave us a daiquiri, and that began 
to calm me'down. But then, damn it, 
somebody came along and took our pic-
ture! The baggage arrived a few moments 
later; no one had opened it. We were 
ushered to an elderly Cadillac and off we 
went toward Havana. 

It was evening; lights were beginning to 
illuminate the towers of the city as we 
approached. The mood of the streets was 
calm, after the hustle and smog of Mexico. 
We watched the signs: 
The Fight of the Vietnamese People is Our 
Fight 
Ten Million Tons of Sugar by 1970 
The, Girl With Green Eyes 
Che-Until Victory! 
Visit Santiago de Cuba 
Communications Will Be Maintained, In 
War As In Peace 
Homeland Or Death; We Shall Overcome 

Only one out of three streetlights were on, 
but the red sun on the brilliant green 
vegetation gave everything a deep glow. 

After supper, we walked into Havana for 
our first look at the Revolution. A few 
blocks from the hotel Anne spotted a small 
building with "PALANTE" pasted in 
hand-cut letters across the windows. We 
decided to walk in, though it was past 
eleven. We found the staff of the leading 
humor magazine, introduced ourselves and 
asked about it. 
"It's a humor magazine-cartoons and 
satire, mainly-though we do some service 
features as well. You could say we make 
fun of just about everything." The editor 
was a young man of about 28 or 30, with 
longish black curly hair, bright green eyes 
and quick smiles. He showed us copies-
16 pages on large sheets of newsprint, 
full-page and half-page cartoons in two 
and and three colors, divided almost 
equally between political and more gen-
eral themes, often very sexy. The carica-
ture of the guerilla soldier was that of 
a defiant little man, all beard, nose and 
boots, often bespectacled, with a gun 
sticking out of the top of the boots where 
they joined the base of his neck; a huge ci-
gar and a beanie topped it off. 

The women were extraordinarly cur-
vacious, all hips and breasts tugging at 
miniskirts and thin blouses. The sex of the 
cartoons was explicit and unrestrained. 
Even the issue following the death of Che 
was grimly, darkly, bitterly humorous: 
guns disguised as cigars protruding from 
beards of defiant soldiers. 

Anne asked him how he got to be editor: 
if he were a member of the party, for in-
stance. He looked a little shy in response. 
"Well, actually, I'm not a member of the 
party; you don't have to be. Maybe I will 
be someday, but I have just a few little de-
fects." 

I asked him if they criticized the gov-
ernment in the magazine. 
"We joke about it a lot, and we try to 
point out what goes wrong. But we don't 
criticize for its own sake and we try not to 
be negative. We think of ourselves as 
revolutionaries and humorists at the same 
time. We try to be truthful and have fun 
with it, too." 

We walked on a few blocks until we 
came to a basement apartment with a 
small sign outside reading "CDR" (Com-
mittees in the Defense of the Revolution), 
and in we went. Large poster of Che on 
the waUs, Marx and Fidel under glass on 
the coffee table, ten folks sitting around the 
room, aU ages, generous blend of colors. 
We just asked who they were and what 
they did. All neighbors, they answered, de-
fending the Revolution at the block level. 


What did they mean? "See this plastic 
bag?" answered a lady. "We get together 
and fill it with dirt that they truck in-to 
the corner. Then we put a coffee seedling in 
it-thousands of bags in a good weekend 
-they go out to the fields in another truck 
and are planted-all around Havana in the 
Havana Cord6n Plan." 

"What do you think about the Revolu-
tion?" 
"Fantastic-the most beautiful thing in 
the world. Here we are, all neighbors, 
black and white. You know, in the old days 
me and Maria here couldn't really get to-
gether. We had our own circles, the places 
I went to, the parties and so on, well, a 
black person couldn't go. We were friends, 
of course, but it just wasn't the same. 
Now-the Revolution-black and white, 
it's all the same." They smiled sweetly at 
each other. 

"Ah, but Fidel, Fidel." A sinewy old 
black man was on his feet now. "We de-
pend on Fidel and his wonderful example, 
'nuestro Hder maximo'; we would be no-
where without our Fidel. What vision! 
What strength! With our Fidel we'll just 
keep moving forward until there's no stop-
ping us!" 

Four women were speaking at once 
now, as if to cut the old fellow off. 
"Look," said one of them, ''you should 
tell the Americans that we don't hate them, 
that we think of them as brothers, 'nuestro 
hermano pals,' but we are determined to 
make this Revolution a complete success. 
It's not the people there, not the people at 
all. But that Mr. Johnson! Well, that's 
something else again. I really wish you'd 
try to get that across when you go back." 

We walked out an hour later with one of 
the young men of the block. "You noticed 
how that old man kept talking about 
Fidel," he said. "Well, frankly, it bothered 
me. That's something Fidel wants to dis-
courage. He doesn't make so many 
speeches now, not like he used to-trying 
to get people to figure things out for them-
selves. That's one of our big problems: 
some people depend too much on Fidel." 

I walked about a mile into Havana this 
afternoon, just to look around. The streets 
are colorless: faded paint and tom posters, 
but no litter. Once in a while you overbear 
a passing comment from one of the older 
ladies-how you have to get in line at 
five in the morning to buy your ration of 
meat and how they might run out when 
there are only five people ahead of you in 
the line. 

Kids all over the place; schools are on 
vacation. 
"Frances?" a little boy called out to me. 
He was sitting with a friend on the edge 
of the sidewalk. I shook my bead. 
"Ruso? Aleman? Checo? Ingles? Itali-
ano?" I kept shaking no. 
"Well what are you then?" 
"American," I answered. 
"My God! I've never seen an Ameri-
can! How did you get here? What are they 
going to do to you when you go back?" 

All of a sudden, I was being mobbed by 
children. They were filling the street. 
Traffic was blocked. Anxious mothers were 
peering over their heads. Older men were 
muttering with each other and eyeing me 
with suspicion. We were on the edge of 
chaos. 
"How high is the Empire State Building? 
Taller than the ones in Havana? Do you 
have lots of cars in America? What about 
the black people? Are you a Black Pan-
ther?" I hated to disappoint them. We 
streamed over to a nearby park and talked 
for hours. One boy wondered if I had ever 
heard of Che. Yes, I told him, sometimes 
we carry his picture. "Then how do you es-
cape from the police when they come after 
you?" he asked. 

We talked most of the evening with 
Miguel, a poet who lives here in Havana. 
"In a way," he was saying, "it's too bad 
Che left. We needed him. He was the op-
position here. He had Fidel's kind of 
charisma. He could touch Fidel. I can't re-
member the number of times I've spoken 
with Fidel, intimately. We are very close. 
But somehow I can't imagine touching 
him, just reaching out and touching him in 
conversation, like this. One simply doesn't 
imagine such things; there is something 
about his presence. But Che could do that, 
the only one. That was a mark of his 
stature. Che was a brilliant man, far more 
so than the average. We have great need 
for more like that. Education is still a great 
problem here. 
"In government, Che stood for more 
economic centralization. He had extensive 
debates with the French economist 
Bettleheim about that. Che would write in 
the magazine Our Industry very powerful 
stuff, even though it sometimes seemed 
like a contest to see who could quote more 
Marx, Lenin and Fidel. Che usually won 
on that score." He paused. 
"I should have died in Bolivia. I would 
have, gladly. Cbe went there and be lost; 
we needed him here. There wasn't a week-
end that Che didn't go to some farm or 
factory for voluntary work. I really think 
there are very few people in Cuba that 
haven't known him and worked with him. 
Children here, they go out now and plant 
coffee and talk very seriously about living 
like Che. He left us that." We asked about 
Fidel. 
"Cuban. That's the best way to describe 
Fidel. Incredibly, powerfully Cuban. 
There's something untamed in the Cuban 
character-it's not just Fidel. In that sense, 
he's the expression of his people. His 
mother carried a gun, a pistol right on her 
~elt. She prayed for the Revolution and 
threatened to shoot anyone who tried to 
nationalize her lands. 
''I'll never forget the early sixties, when 
Fidel was having all his troubles with the 
Catholic church. He was laid up with 
pneumonia when his mother announced 
that she would celebrate a public mass in 
the largest cathedral in Havana for his 
recovery. Poor Fidel had to drag himself 
out of bed to tell his mother that it just 
wasn't good politics/
