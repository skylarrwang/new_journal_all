People were breaking into small groups 
and talking excitedly. Four smaller chil-
dren ran up to me and asked if I knew how 
to dance the Hankipanki. I denied any 
knowledge of it. "So what do you do when 
you dance?" 
"Anything that comes into my mind," I 
said, trying to avoid the showdown. 
"Great! Jet's dance," answered a twelve-year-old girl. 
"I'll dance if we all dance," I offered. 
A boy started to bang out the Hankipanki 
on his guitar. The older girl began to 
dance in front of me and took my hand. I 
can't be certain, but I don't think it was 
the Hankipanki. But it was good. It wasn't 
until then that I noticed her wedding ring. 
After the dance I asked about that. 
"Ha. Don't worry." She was laughing 
with some of the women. 
"You're damn right I'll worry." 
"OK; I'll tell you about that. My hus-
band ... well, when we were both in the 
militia about three years ago we weren't 
married yet, we were just novios. There 
was a meeting one night and Fidel came. I 
don't know why, but he asked my boy-
friend why he wasn't married and he said, 
'Comandante, the truth is I have a girl-
friend, that one there. We'd like to get 
married, but just now the time isn't right. 
My parents are against it. It's a delicate 
thing, really, comandante. Well, you see, 
my girl is a little on the dark side, and myÂ· 
parents aren't quite ready for that, com-
prende?' So Fidel just looks at him for a 
long time, then he slams his fist and says, 
'You're getting married!' Fidel thought we 
ought to have a military wedding. You 
know, swords and all that. I had on a very 
cute little white wedding dress. Short. My 
boyfriend wore his uniform. Fidel said we 
ought to have a nice honeymoon, and he 
paid for us to go to Varadero Beach. You 
could say Fidel was really interested in 
that wedding. We got divorced after that. 
So you can stop worrying." 


We got up at 5:00AM on Wednesday, 
breakfast at six and out to work by seven, 
digging more pits for the coffee seedlings. 
We had a contest with one of the other 
brigades to see who could dig the most pits 
in eight hours. I was told that the four-
hour average for one guy is 90 or 100. I 
got in 174 in the morning; one guy did 252. 
An older man, about 65, was the low man 
with 90. And he was roundly congratu-
lated. The spirit continued to be great, 
reaching a peak at mid-morning melon 
break for watermelon, lemonade and 
dirty jokes. 

The afternoon was slower. A threat of 
rain drove most of the men back to the 
camp. "WeiJ, you know what Fidel says," 
I was told. " 'Not a single wet worker in 
this revolution!' Now don't get the wrong 
idea; if there is something that has to be 
done, and it has to be done right away, 
we do it, rain or no rain. Why once I cut 
cane for 17 hours straight-it would have 
dried up if we hadn't worked like that. 
But if we can keep dry we like to." 

During that break, the talk turned to 
examples of good working spirit. 
"You should see that Cuban Central 
Committee when they came out to cut 
cane. No water, no rest stops, just flying 
cane. You get one of those guys out in 
front of you and you really want to work. 
You know, if Fidel came by he'd just grab 
a hoe and do more work than anyone else." 

There was a very heavy guy with a heart 
condition who told me, "I can't do any 
hard fast work-it's the condition I have; 
it could kill me. I can only do a few dozen 
pits a day, but everyone should do what 
he can." I suggested that if they keep up 
this pace, it should all pay off in lots of 
food within a few years. "Well, you can't 
really say that in 'X' years we'll be well 
off. When you think of Vietnam .... You 
know, as long as there is anyone in the 
world who needs our help, such as in Viet-
nam, we'll just keep on working like this." 

The clouds blew over, and we continued 
to work until about five. It had been a 
very rough day; my hands were sore, and 
my whole body felt lilce it would be hard 
to get up in the morning. I was leaving 
that night at midnight for Havana and then 
for home. There was to be a talent show 
in the camp in my honor, and I was to 
sing some songs. I was thinking about that 
when one of the men approached me 
quietly on the road back to camp. "They 
say you're leaving tonight to go back to 
the United States. I hope you'll write. It's 
been good having you here. I want you to 
know one thing, and I am very serious. 
You know, I have a wonderful family and 
a good job--a very good life. But never-
theless, I've written to the Party in Havana 
offering to go and fight in Vietnam if that 
is necessary. That would be the greatest 
honor in the world, to fight alongside those 
men and women. And I've been thinking, 
talking to you, about the United States. 
You've made a great impression here; you 
have a great task before you in that coun-
try. I can understand why you want to go 
back. It's a beautiful land with fine people; 
I traveled there some years ago. Someday 
I hope to return. Let me just say this to 
you. The struggle you will have in that 
country will not be easy. Please remember 
this. If you ever feel you need help, I 
am willing to come and fight alongside 
you. It would be a fine thing to fight for 
such a wonderful country as the United 
States."

Daddy won it. But my father says the 
Presidency of the United States is never 
stolen, and he wouldn't want a recount be-
cause he wouldn't want to win that way." 

And now Julie has dropped out of 
Smith, apparently having gotten all she 
can out of the school, but David attends 
Amherst Tuesdays through Thursdays, de-
voting the weekends to jetting to whatever 
spot the Nixon campaign chooses. While at 
school he not only seriously devotes him-
self to studying-a fraternity friend says 
that David has never missed his Tuesday 
class at 9:00-he also talks with local 
leaders about Republican strategy. Yes, 
here is a coUege spokesman that the Amer-
ican working class can admire. 

They have progressed a long way, this 
pair, from the simple pleasures of Route 9, 
with never a wisp of an idea of what the 
future would reveal. And one can imagine 
them twenty years or more from now, 
when the road between two colleges will 
become the path to the Presidency, when 
the nation will turn to this glowing couple 
as new redeemers in the image of Nixon. 
Julie of course will still smile and say that 
her husband is the greatest man ever and 
of course she takes all her orders from 
him; David will smile too and refuse to 
meet any candidate in a televised debate 
and promise to get us out of whatever 
war we're in at the time. And he probably 
will. '"I.E

ing and expression, views toward the value 
of education and how it fits into their 
lives, as well as some of the more psychic 
and personal needs and desires of women 
As it is, Yale Graduate School, by its very 
nature of being a career-oriented, profes 
sionally academic training school, forces 
women, whose identity is not defined by 
their achievements but by their insights 
and perceptions, to renounce that which is 
essential to their integrity-their femin-
inity. 

When Yale leaps into coeducation, it 
had better consider what educating women 
really means. But then, maybe it will take 
several thousand women to make Yale 
aware of what it has been doing to its 
women and to help make it a natural at-
mosphere for living as well as learning. 
For the sake of the men at least as much 
as for the women, I hope coeducation will 
be complete and soon. It is only when 
male undergraduates, graduate students 
and faculty can view women as a natural 
part of their lives that women can again 
be free from the tensions which make their 
years here so often a dehumanizing, de-
sexualizing drag.

**Living end**
**Page number(s): 11**

Even that bastion of solidarity, the New 
York Times, is beginning to show a few 
cracks. 

Walter Kerr thinks they have ugly 
bodies. 

Eric Bentley denounced Clive Barnes in 
his article, "I reject the Living Theater." 
Clive Barnes returned fire by accusing 
Bentley of "propagandistic journalism of 
a high degree of sophistication." 

But no one captured the Living Theatre 
quite the way a Minnesota editor did as he 
read a wire dispatch about Paradise Now 
at Yale. Readers of the St. Paul Dispatch 
were offered the following editorial: 
"The so-called 'living theater' may have 
become the living end. 
"Or so it seemed in New Haven late 
Thursday night. The Yale Drama School 
is currently presenting New Paradise, a 
play which ends with a member of the cast 
shouting, 'The streets belong to the people,' 
at which point he leads the rest of the cast, 
and any game members of the audience, 
out into the street where they undress 
themselves. 
"Well, as anyone knows, it's easy to 
bomb in New Haven. But this play more 
than bombed; it ended with 10 people get-
ting arrested by the New Haven police, a 
fine force, but not one noted for its love of 
the theater, living or dead. 
"Those arrested were charged with in-
decent exposure and a breach of the peace. 
To which you might say, 'Lousy cops! 
They foiled a work of art.' 
"But the error, surely, is with the play. 
Anything which calls itself theater, no 
matter how it applies to or duplicates 
reality, is supposed to be make-believe. 
When you write a play to have people 
running about naked on public streets, the 
play has breached the limits of make-
believe. 
"In short, there can be no such thing as 
'living theater,' that is drama that some-
how is meant to come alive in the real 
world, for if it truly becomes part of that 
world, if it becomes 'living,' then it is no 
longer theater. 
"Surely, the police of New Haven prob-
ably haven't thought this through, and 
certainly they don't have to. It's quite 
simple: people aren't supposed to run 
around in public with no clothes on, 
whether they're players or not. 
" 'Living theater' has little future in the 
world of the living-
it should stay with 
the world of the theater. In the meantime, 
Old Blues could spread the story that this 
really happened at Harvard." 


**Letters**

To the editors: 
It is easy to understand why many who 
wish to advance the goals of peace and of 
civil and human rights have been unde-
cided about how, or even whether, to vote 
in this year's Presidential election. Having 
shared this indecision, we have now con-
cluded that we should vote-and vote for 
for Hubert Humphrey and Edmund 
Muskie. We want to explain why. 

Everyone who fails to vote for President 
adds to George Wallace's percentage of 
total votes cast and helps to promote his 
influence in the future. We believe that 
his powerful appeal to prejudice and 
violence must be repudiated now, before 
it gains further support. Moreover, write-
in votes for a scattering of other candidates 
will be unavailing for this purpose; what 
newsmen and campaign managers will talk 
about are the Humphrey-Nixon-Wallace 
figures. 

presupposes that there is no choice be-
tween Nixon-Agnew and Humphrey-
Muskie. We believe there is a choice. We 
feel that the Republicans are far less likely 
than the Democrats to make headway 
against the militarism, intolerance and in-
justice that disturb us so deeply. We are 
reassured by Muskie and .appalled that 
Agnew could become President. 

gives an uncontested vote to the people 
with whom he most strongly disagrees. By 
refusing to vote, many disillusioned Dem-
ocrats and Independents would give away 
the next two to eight years, in the hope that 
Democratic politicians will come to them. 
But there is good evidence that, as Nelson 
Polsby says, "It is neither the meek nor the 
pure of heart who inherit the wreckage of 
a political party when the party is buried 
in a landslide. Incumbent office-holders 
and party 'regulars' pick up the pieces." 

Furthermore, what happens during 
these years will determine the course of 
our future. We fear that even if 1972 or 
1976 brings the election of a man we ad-
mire unreservedly, his effectiveness may 
be crippled by the mistakes of his im-
mediate predecessor. If we really want to 
overcome the apathy and hatred that 
threaten our country, we will do well to 
participate realistically in the choice of 
our next President.
