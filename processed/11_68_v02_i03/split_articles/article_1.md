When I heard that General Curtis LeMay was speaking at the Forestry School, I immediately began preparations to write a first rate hatchet job. Indeed, I started to hone and polish every verbal axe in my linguistic tool box-from metaphor and pretentious allusion to irony and downright sarcasm. With a bow toward Thoreau, I would call my piece, "In Wildness is the Defoliation of the World," and I would fill it with pithy comments about the General's inability to see the forest for the trees. After having listened to LeMay, however, I am obliged to put my caustic metaphors back into mothballs and to de-escalate my irony. To my surprise-and that of most of the audience-LeMay was impressive and honest.


On the face of it, General LeMay's speech was simply a well reasoned and carefully documented plea for "war" against "the dissipation of our natural re-sources in this country, yes, even in the world." In language that was always articulate and sometimes ruggedly poetic, he complained that although Lake Erie was "dead" and the Hudson River "practically a sewage canal," Americans continued slowly to "commit suicide" by their "reckless waste of our resources." Indeed, he feared the "imminent collapse of our natural environment."


Conservation has been a major political issue for at least a hundred years, and it has been important not merely because it related to the disposition of wealth but because it implied a vision of America as the bountiful "virgin land." Like Frederick Jackson Turner and so many others, LeMay saw both literal and symbolic relationship between the depletion of Nature's gifts and the declining quality of American life. In three hundred years, he said, we have replaced a "natural paradise" with smog-soaked cities. Moreover, we shall never achieve peace, security and racial justice so long as nations and individuals must "compete for a handful of food and a mouthful of water."


LeMay thinks (or rather feels) that there is something wrong with America, but his speech was not a sentimentalist's longing for his lost virgin land, nor was it a rant against smog-laden cities filled with "theoreticians" and "pointy-headed bureaucrats," to borrow his runningmate's idiom. Unlike George Wallace, Curtis LeMay is a good soldier who defers with respect-sometimes with awe-to expert opinion. Indeed, although LeMay's "bomb 'em back to the Stone Age" military strategy may be unique, his political analysis of Vietnam is clearly culled from "expert" writings on containment by Kennan, Rostow, Rusk and other "liberal" intellectuals.


Although LeMay emphasized that government and administration should be as decentralized as possible, he advocated a federal "organization of competent people" to coordinate the salvation of the American environment. Because resource depletion is a problem "of such magnitude that it makes going to the moon look easy," this bureau would be "many times" the size of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Moreover, LeMay said that government control should begin "at once" to "force" an end to water and air pollution by private enterprise.


Shortly after World War II, LeMay turned down an appointment to a vacant Senate seat from Ohio because he didn't want to enter politics. In a sense, he still hasn't entered politics. George Wallace's candor has declined as his Gallup poll has risen, but Curtis LeMay still says what's on his mind, even if it contradicts his runningmate and even if it contradicts what was on his mind two sentences ago.


Certainly Wallace must shudder to think that some of the home folks might hear of LeMay's enthusiasm for birth control and his assertion that there are "many, many, many cases where legalized abortion is the proper thing to do and should be left up to the people concerned and the physician concerned." Certainly Wallace supporters who consider states' rights a sacred revelation would look askance at LeMay's willingness to use "big government" to purify biological ecosystems.


George Wallace has created a more or less consistent ideology, with a hero (himself), villains (Earl Warren, the "pseudo-intellectuals") and a theory of history (the trend toward "creeping socialism" at home and the external threat of Godless Communism). Curtis LeMay is like the disgusted cab driver or cop who will vote for the Wallace ticket, not out of sympathy for a specific political philosophy but because he feels in his guts that something is rotten. These men can't articulate their gripes, but their grievances are no less real.
