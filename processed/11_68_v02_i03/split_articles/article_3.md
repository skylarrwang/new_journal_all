It lies serenely between the Berkshire hills in the heart of Massachusetts, this weather-beaten valley, this preserve of all that is old and good in the history of New England ways. And wending its way through the heart of the valley, with the huge, raw New England sky hovering always above, is Route 9. Route 9, which spans the seven miles between two schools as if it is a personal learning experience itself: travelling along this road one senses that here all of the aspects of the worthy life have been deliberately set out for display in a religious-pastoral pattern ... the trees and meadows, the small red schoolhouses and humble private homes, owner-operated businesses and large chain stores, the feeling ... as if, somehow, it had all been preordained. Our story concerns two people who managed to use this road, who saw it not just as the road between Smith and Amherst but as something greater: David Eisenhower and Julie Nixon, who, even before the public became aware of their collective presence, were bridging the gap and making the connection.


As all relationships must start, so did this one: the two future mates barely aware of each other's existence. Perhaps David knew from the start that Julie Nixon, the girl he hadn't seen for eight years and remembered only as a pesty little brat who hung around the White House (of course, he didn't care much for girls at that time), was a freshman at Smith, but he thought little of it. He was too worried about doing well at Amherst and meeting new friends. The boys in his dorm remember how he used to introduce himself as "David," avoiding the addition of his last name from embarrassment or the feeling that everyone knew already, so that there was no point in overdoing it. Occasionally he would complain to some sympathetic listener about the administration's attempt to protect him by stocking his entry with seventy percent prep-school alumni, giving him more a feeling of frustration than comfort. At any rate, these opening weeks were an unsteady time for him, when he was unsure what course his future would take. He had just been chairman of Exeter's Liberal Party and had considered himself a liberal, but now these leanings were, well . . . . He would sometimes try out a new position in discussions on such neutral topics as the merits of Barry Goldwater, started by still-nervous freshmen who needed some safe subject to tear apart. From the right corner of the room, a quiet voice (David's): "Well, I don't think Goldwater was so bad."


The same process of adjustment must have been occurring at Julie's end of the road. Everyone knew she was coming to Smith, so they were understandably nervous, worried she wouldn't like them. Her destined freshman roommate was almost frantic, coming from Oregon and knowing little of those slick Eastern ways. But all were pleasantly surprised. Well, Julie did display this thin facade, a kind of pseudo-sophistication that was hard to take at first; and she had such marvelously well-tailored clothes in perfect style--the skirts always reaching exactly to the knee--and she was already so ... Smith. However, they soon realized her genuine sweetness and sincerity and her real interest in everybody's activities. Maybe some of the Baldwin House girls couldn't become too close because they were afraid of upsetting Julie by disagreeing with her father's political views, but the others readily accepted her into their close-knit group. The spirit of Smith found a roost in her so easily that anyone who didn't realize who she was would have sworn she had attended Smith for years.


Still the two continued oblivious of each other, dating other people, until one fateful day a Republican Organization Woman, little realizing herself to be the pawn of some divine agency, called David and suggested he take Julie out for publicity reasons. David talked to Julie, but was wary at first. "I just spoke to Julie Nixon, and boy did she sound obnoxious." He asked some of his acquaintances if they wanted to date her; but finding no suitable substitute and feeling some sense of commitment, he asked her out. Even then his first impression was not entirely eradicated, but he was starting to waver. Her benign, cleansing influence was uprooting his fears, soothing his harried soul. For Julie liked David from the start.


After that first phone call she reported to friends his deep, humble voice and generally amenable nature. She knew that he was different from the unsatisfactory dates she had experienced thus far and hoped that he would understand and second the views that other boys scoffed at. But she must have known he would, for behind the sweet smile that covered her face lay the thought: "Daddy will be so pleased!"


Love does not grow as easily as the Eisenhower - Nixon: 1968 magazine would like to believe. It takes time and effort and sharing. Julie was willing to devote that time to helping David in his troubled development. By October of their freshman year they were dating fairly regularly, straining to sprout a mutual feeling. During Thanksgiving vacation she invited David (after he got a haircut) to the family retreat, showing him the serenity and purity of her home life. He met her father and saw the man's ideals in practice-his gracious smile, genuine affection for friends and family, determination to preserve the good things in American society. David also met the Minollas -the Nixon's servant couple-and was impressed by their treatment as part of the family, the way they worshipped the Nixons and obediently, almost eagerly, did everything asked of them.


At this time Julie was still dating another boy, the only leftover from her pre-David experimentation, but this would soon end. He was a fine boy, as Julie's freshman roommate recalls: "He was pretty nice. He must have been, to go out with her." But he was nowhere near-and


Their friends at the two schools shared in their activity, participated in their infectious joy. Once when Julie phoned the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity house, which David entered in his sophomore year, the person answered, "He's out in back blowing pot."


Julie thought for a few seconds. "Oh, no. Not David."


"Well, you never can tell about him. He's always trying new things."


But then of course they laughed good-naturedly in unison, Julie realizing through the absurdity of the situation that it was just a friendly joke. The boys at Amherst were unsure what Julie was really like, some considering her friendly but not too intelligent, others asserting that behind her surface lurked a real depth of thought. The girls in Baldwin House thought David was very funny and entertaining (although his A.D. buddies classify him as mainly inoffensive), as they remembered the times they sat with him for hours, listening to anecdotes, having a generally jolly time. Regardless of what any of them thought, the most consistent image was the two of them engaging in their favorite on-campus activity-sitting for hours at the Amherst snack bar eating ice cream, staring at a cold slab of fudge ripple.


However they occupied themselves on campus, their fondest memory together was probably the road and the many times they walked, hitchhiked or drove down it -driving coming only after Ike's expression of disapproval over their thumbing activities, necessitating the joint ownership of a light-green 1962 Valiant. They must have enjoyed most of all walking hand-in-hand, wending their solitary way through fallen autumn leaves. Perhaps stopping and reminiscing in the playground of the red-brick schoolhouse, while a little girl beat out erasers, sending clouds of chalk dust into the chill-edged air. Maybe they wandered into the little shop with its distinctive sign: "Julie's Flower Garden-Cut Flowers," picking out some green remembrance of the blossoming countryside, to be guarded in their rooms while they were apart. They might have gone to the Hadley drive-in, little more than an unpainted billboard, smiling together at the screen antics of Hell's Angels counterparts. But most likely they relished sitting together under a tree on some secluded section of a romantically flowing meadow, flirting playfully:


"You know Daddy's a Quaker."


"Yes, Julie."


"You know Quakers are pacifists and believe that all men are equal."


"Yes, Daddy agreed- the ideal David approached. So by the International Debutante Ball in December-when Julie reigned as the American representative, gliding down the aisle while the tones of "America the Beautiful" filled the Waldorf Astoria ballroom and David attentively followed as her official civilian escort-they were inseparable.


They became the Siamese twins, a couple of grafted destinies: David looking like a cross between the urbanity of a Playboy ad for Cricketeer suits and the innocence of a Norman Rockwell depiction of Tom Sawyer; Julie with her round, wholesome face, pleasing smile and conservative dresses--never pants--resembling the ideal American companion. They attended everything together. Dances at Baldwin House where they could lose themselves in the infectious soul of a (white) rock band. Culturally enriching activities, such as plays, which they could enjoy in their winning way, Julie commenting after one dramatic production: "It was so nice. They all spoke with such cute British accents."


So they grew together, building to engagement as a natural outcome of their love.


Yet they must have known that this delicious privacy could not last. For the announcement of the engagement of these Republican progenies, accomplished by Nixon via television while campaigning before the Oregon primary, could only bring them national attention. And of course the Nixon campaign organizers would expect them to help in the cause. Luckily they were of the same mind, David having long since dropped his dangerous liberal attitudes, so that although they loathed the loss of their private, innocent sharing, they were ready to do what they could to help Nixon, despite unwished-for publicity. At the first press conference after the engagement announcement they told the world how happy they were and that from then until after the election their time would be devoted to the cause.


The couple set to work: attending Nixon rallies, speaking at dinners, wearing "Nixon's the One!" buttons. They exchanged the road between Smith and Amherst for a national road, a conglomeration of all the American trails--from backwoods cow-path to superhighway. David, especially, proved to be an eloquent representative of the Nixon teachings. He knew that Nixon had made certain questionable moves, such as catering to Strom Thurmond, but he understood their motivation. "Strom Thurmond is second to God with a large segment of American voters. I guess he's third now that Wallace is second .... In practical terms Strom Thurmond held the line with the southern delegations. Now, does that mean you disregard Strom Thurmond and watch the nomination go down the river?" He commented on Nixon's determination to end the war, the problems of a vocal left causing a dangerous threat from the right, and the way Wallace was helped by Watts, Chicago and similar incidents. Here was a college spokesman that the American working class could admire.


Of course Julie was there all the time, giving her silent support, commending him on his fine progress. From time to time she talked with the press, but hers was mainly a nostalgic position, reflecting on the past with an unstated but obvious confidence in the future: "I still haven't conceded the 1960 election. I do believe
