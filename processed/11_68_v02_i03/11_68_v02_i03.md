**Title: In Comment: Curtis LeMay marches to the beat of a different drummer, Yale is no Walden for graduate women, and civil disobedience and the theatre gets a thorough review.**
**Author: Leo Ribuffo**
**Page number(s): 2**

When I heard that General Curtis LeMay was speaking at the Forestry School, I immediately began preparations to write a first rate hatchet job. Indeed, I started to hone and polish every verbal axe in my linguistic tool box-from metaphor and pretentious allusion to irony and downright sarcasm. With a bow toward Thoreau, I would call my piece, "In Wildness is the Defoliation of the World," and I would fill it with pithy comments about the General's inability to see the forest for the trees. After having listened to LeMay, however, I am obliged to put my caustic metaphors back into mothballs and to de-escalate my irony. To my surprise-and that of most of the audience-LeMay was impressive and honest.


On the face of it, General LeMay's speech was simply a well reasoned and carefully documented plea for "war" against "the dissipation of our natural re-sources in this country, yes, even in the world." In language that was always articulate and sometimes ruggedly poetic, he complained that although Lake Erie was "dead" and the Hudson River "practically a sewage canal," Americans continued slowly to "commit suicide" by their "reckless waste of our resources." Indeed, he feared the "imminent collapse of our natural environment."


Conservation has been a major political issue for at least a hundred years, and it has been important not merely because it related to the disposition of wealth but because it implied a vision of America as the bountiful "virgin land." Like Frederick Jackson Turner and so many others, LeMay saw both literal and symbolic relationship between the depletion of Nature's gifts and the declining quality of American life. In three hundred years, he said, we have replaced a "natural paradise" with smog-soaked cities. Moreover, we shall never achieve peace, security and racial justice so long as nations and individuals must "compete for a handful of food and a mouthful of water."


LeMay thinks (or rather feels) that there is something wrong with America, but his speech was not a sentimentalist's longing for his lost virgin land, nor was it a rant against smog-laden cities filled with "theoreticians" and "pointy-headed bureaucrats," to borrow his runningmate's idiom. Unlike George Wallace, Curtis LeMay is a good soldier who defers with respect-sometimes with awe-to expert opinion. Indeed, although LeMay's "bomb 'em back to the Stone Age" military strategy may be unique, his political analysis of Vietnam is clearly culled from "expert" writings on containment by Kennan, Rostow, Rusk and other "liberal" intellectuals.


Although LeMay emphasized that government and administration should be as decentralized as possible, he advocated a federal "organization of competent people" to coordinate the salvation of the American environment. Because resource depletion is a problem "of such magnitude that it makes going to the moon look easy," this bureau would be "many times" the size of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Moreover, LeMay said that government control should begin "at once" to "force" an end to water and air pollution by private enterprise.


Shortly after World War II, LeMay turned down an appointment to a vacant Senate seat from Ohio because he didn't want to enter politics. In a sense, he still hasn't entered politics. George Wallace's candor has declined as his Gallup poll has risen, but Curtis LeMay still says what's on his mind, even if it contradicts his runningmate and even if it contradicts what was on his mind two sentences ago.


Certainly Wallace must shudder to think that some of the home folks might hear of LeMay's enthusiasm for birth control and his assertion that there are "many, many, many cases where legalized abortion is the proper thing to do and should be left up to the people concerned and the physician concerned." Certainly Wallace supporters who consider states' rights a sacred revelation would look askance at LeMay's willingness to use "big government" to purify biological ecosystems.


George Wallace has created a more or less consistent ideology, with a hero (himself), villains (Earl Warren, the "pseudo-intellectuals") and a theory of history (the trend toward "creeping socialism" at home and the external threat of Godless Communism). Curtis LeMay is like the disgusted cab driver or cop who will vote for the Wallace ticket, not out of sympathy for a specific political philosophy but because he feels in his guts that something is rotten. These men can't articulate their gripes, but their grievances are no less real.


**Title: Women**
**Author:  (Unnamed)**
**Page number(s): 2, 14**

They come to Yale, these people, to learn and to meet people. They come with varying degrees of self-awareness, but usually they see themselves as whole human beings: whole feminine human beings. And that is where the trouble begins; for these people are women in the Graduate School at Yale.


It does not take long for the campus to become familiar to them; but, at the same time, they remain aware of something strange. In the natural loneliness of the first few weeks it is hard to distinguish feelings, but soon the disease becomes apparent. They are becoming bods--bods to be stared at, bods to be evaluated, bods to be fantasized about, bods for the Yalies to visually screw. For some, for a while, it is exciting to be so appreciated. For others, right away, it is repulsive. For all, sooner or later, it is dehumanizing, desexualizing and a drag. No matter what they may be like as people, at Yale they stand out. The averted eyes or the grilling stare make them aware that somehow they don't really belong.


As they sit through their seminars, they experience a different strain. The first few times it isn't clear why they are so often put down. The more they talk knowledgeably or perceptively, the clearer it becomes. They are becoming impersonalized female minds-minds to be tested, minds to be dissected, minds to be proved inferior, minds for the graduate men to mentally rape. For some, for a while, it is challenging and stimulating. For others, right away, it is demoralizing. For all, sooner or later, it is dehumanizing, desexualizing and a drag.


To be criticized, as they are by graduate men, for being unfeminine and frigid is brutal when they are being prodded to be hard-nosed, competitive minds in class. Kenneth Kenniston, a professor of psychiatry at Yale, says: "Yale is a magnet for men who don't really want to be around women. Put these men in the same school as women who resent the renunciation that graduate school involves anyway, and you have a pretty tense situation." The damned-if-you-are, damned-if-you're-not atmosphere in the Graduate School makes women aware that somehow they do not really belong.


They begin their academic program with the faculty. After several sessions of discussing ideas, they become aware of a different tension. Gradually they begin to understand that they are becoming precocious psyches-psyches to be patronized, to be dominated, to be professionalized-psyches for the faculty to prostitute. For a while it is an ego trip. Ultimately it is a down.


They are expected to prove their competence as scholars while assuming that this has no relation to their personalities or lives as women. The more they conform to the grad-grind syndrome, the easier the tensions become. But if they are spirited, involved or not career oriented, they become aware that, somehow, they do not realy belong. After a couple of years, many of them (60%) drop out.


But the real question is: Why are women so disruptive? Why should they be so raptly attended as bodies, minds and careers and so consistently ignored as persons? Why must they constantly prove themselves competent sexually, mentally and professionally? Haven't they declared time and again that this is a good thing?


Maybe all these women are just paranoid. Yet is it paranoid to cringe when you walk into Hungry Charley's on a Saturday night only to be asked if you are enjoying the mixer? Is it paranoid to go to an art film and be nauseated by the whistles, hisses, ooo's and woo's of the Yalies when a woman's body is exposed? Is it paranoid to wonder at the overwhelming admisison of single graduate males that they never even considered how many women would be at Yale when they applied? Is it paranoid to feel that Yale is hypocritical when they allow women into their school while classifying gynecological problems as "special" medical problems? And is it paranoid to be dismayed when a professor asks if you are sure you want to go through with your degree because you expressed a concern about the academic, personal and social problems at Yale and in New Haven?


The women who come to Yale are not just male minds in female bodies. They are not unfeminine intellects trying to make it in a man's world. They are women in all that makes women different and unique. For all the talk that is going around about feminine mystiques it is amazing that all the difference Yale acknowledges between men and women is the sexual one.


It might be worth while to consider some of the differences in modes of think-

**Title: David and Julie: a romance**
**Author: James Durchslag**
**Page number(s): 3, 14**

It lies serenely between the Berkshire hills in the heart of Massachusetts, this weather-beaten valley, this preserve of all that is old and good in the history of New England ways. And wending its way through the heart of the valley, with the huge, raw New England sky hovering always above, is Route 9. Route 9, which spans the seven miles between two schools as if it is a personal learning experience itself: travelling along this road one senses that here all of the aspects of the worthy life have been deliberately set out for display in a religious-pastoral pattern ... the trees and meadows, the small red schoolhouses and humble private homes, owner-operated businesses and large chain stores, the feeling ... as if, somehow, it had all been preordained. Our story concerns two people who managed to use this road, who saw it not just as the road between Smith and Amherst but as something greater: David Eisenhower and Julie Nixon, who, even before the public became aware of their collective presence, were bridging the gap and making the connection.


As all relationships must start, so did this one: the two future mates barely aware of each other's existence. Perhaps David knew from the start that Julie Nixon, the girl he hadn't seen for eight years and remembered only as a pesty little brat who hung around the White House (of course, he didn't care much for girls at that time), was a freshman at Smith, but he thought little of it. He was too worried about doing well at Amherst and meeting new friends. The boys in his dorm remember how he used to introduce himself as "David," avoiding the addition of his last name from embarrassment or the feeling that everyone knew already, so that there was no point in overdoing it. Occasionally he would complain to some sympathetic listener about the administration's attempt to protect him by stocking his entry with seventy percent prep-school alumni, giving him more a feeling of frustration than comfort. At any rate, these opening weeks were an unsteady time for him, when he was unsure what course his future would take. He had just been chairman of Exeter's Liberal Party and had considered himself a liberal, but now these leanings were, well . . . . He would sometimes try out a new position in discussions on such neutral topics as the merits of Barry Goldwater, started by still-nervous freshmen who needed some safe subject to tear apart. From the right corner of the room, a quiet voice (David's): "Well, I don't think Goldwater was so bad."


The same process of adjustment must have been occurring at Julie's end of the road. Everyone knew she was coming to Smith, so they were understandably nervous, worried she wouldn't like them. Her destined freshman roommate was almost frantic, coming from Oregon and knowing little of those slick Eastern ways. But all were pleasantly surprised. Well, Julie did display this thin facade, a kind of pseudo-sophistication that was hard to take at first; and she had such marvelously well-tailored clothes in perfect style--the skirts always reaching exactly to the knee--and she was already so ... Smith. However, they soon realized her genuine sweetness and sincerity and her real interest in everybody's activities. Maybe some of the Baldwin House girls couldn't become too close because they were afraid of upsetting Julie by disagreeing with her father's political views, but the others readily accepted her into their close-knit group. The spirit of Smith found a roost in her so easily that anyone who didn't realize who she was would have sworn she had attended Smith for years.


Still the two continued oblivious of each other, dating other people, until one fateful day a Republican Organization Woman, little realizing herself to be the pawn of some divine agency, called David and suggested he take Julie out for publicity reasons. David talked to Julie, but was wary at first. "I just spoke to Julie Nixon, and boy did she sound obnoxious." He asked some of his acquaintances if they wanted to date her; but finding no suitable substitute and feeling some sense of commitment, he asked her out. Even then his first impression was not entirely eradicated, but he was starting to waver. Her benign, cleansing influence was uprooting his fears, soothing his harried soul. For Julie liked David from the start.


After that first phone call she reported to friends his deep, humble voice and generally amenable nature. She knew that he was different from the unsatisfactory dates she had experienced thus far and hoped that he would understand and second the views that other boys scoffed at. But she must have known he would, for behind the sweet smile that covered her face lay the thought: "Daddy will be so pleased!"


Love does not grow as easily as the Eisenhower - Nixon: 1968 magazine would like to believe. It takes time and effort and sharing. Julie was willing to devote that time to helping David in his troubled development. By October of their freshman year they were dating fairly regularly, straining to sprout a mutual feeling. During Thanksgiving vacation she invited David (after he got a haircut) to the family retreat, showing him the serenity and purity of her home life. He met her father and saw the man's ideals in practice-his gracious smile, genuine affection for friends and family, determination to preserve the good things in American society. David also met the Minollas -the Nixon's servant couple-and was impressed by their treatment as part of the family, the way they worshipped the Nixons and obediently, almost eagerly, did everything asked of them.


At this time Julie was still dating another boy, the only leftover from her pre-David experimentation, but this would soon end. He was a fine boy, as Julie's freshman roommate recalls: "He was pretty nice. He must have been, to go out with her." But he was nowhere near-and


Their friends at the two schools shared in their activity, participated in their infectious joy. Once when Julie phoned the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity house, which David entered in his sophomore year, the person answered, "He's out in back blowing pot."


Julie thought for a few seconds. "Oh, no. Not David."


"Well, you never can tell about him. He's always trying new things."


But then of course they laughed good-naturedly in unison, Julie realizing through the absurdity of the situation that it was just a friendly joke. The boys at Amherst were unsure what Julie was really like, some considering her friendly but not too intelligent, others asserting that behind her surface lurked a real depth of thought. The girls in Baldwin House thought David was very funny and entertaining (although his A.D. buddies classify him as mainly inoffensive), as they remembered the times they sat with him for hours, listening to anecdotes, having a generally jolly time. Regardless of what any of them thought, the most consistent image was the two of them engaging in their favorite on-campus activity-sitting for hours at the Amherst snack bar eating ice cream, staring at a cold slab of fudge ripple.


However they occupied themselves on campus, their fondest memory together was probably the road and the many times they walked, hitchhiked or drove down it -driving coming only after Ike's expression of disapproval over their thumbing activities, necessitating the joint ownership of a light-green 1962 Valiant. They must have enjoyed most of all walking hand-in-hand, wending their solitary way through fallen autumn leaves. Perhaps stopping and reminiscing in the playground of the red-brick schoolhouse, while a little girl beat out erasers, sending clouds of chalk dust into the chill-edged air. Maybe they wandered into the little shop with its distinctive sign: "Julie's Flower Garden-Cut Flowers," picking out some green remembrance of the blossoming countryside, to be guarded in their rooms while they were apart. They might have gone to the Hadley drive-in, little more than an unpainted billboard, smiling together at the screen antics of Hell's Angels counterparts. But most likely they relished sitting together under a tree on some secluded section of a romantically flowing meadow, flirting playfully:


"You know Daddy's a Quaker."


"Yes, Julie."


"You know Quakers are pacifists and believe that all men are equal."


"Yes, Daddy agreed- the ideal David approached. So by the International Debutante Ball in December-when Julie reigned as the American representative, gliding down the aisle while the tones of "America the Beautiful" filled the Waldorf Astoria ballroom and David attentively followed as her official civilian escort-they were inseparable.


They became the Siamese twins, a couple of grafted destinies: David looking like a cross between the urbanity of a Playboy ad for Cricketeer suits and the innocence of a Norman Rockwell depiction of Tom Sawyer; Julie with her round, wholesome face, pleasing smile and conservative dresses--never pants--resembling the ideal American companion. They attended everything together. Dances at Baldwin House where they could lose themselves in the infectious soul of a (white) rock band. Culturally enriching activities, such as plays, which they could enjoy in their winning way, Julie commenting after one dramatic production: "It was so nice. They all spoke with such cute British accents."


So they grew together, building to engagement as a natural outcome of their love.


Yet they must have known that this delicious privacy could not last. For the announcement of the engagement of these Republican progenies, accomplished by Nixon via television while campaigning before the Oregon primary, could only bring them national attention. And of course the Nixon campaign organizers would expect them to help in the cause. Luckily they were of the same mind, David having long since dropped his dangerous liberal attitudes, so that although they loathed the loss of their private, innocent sharing, they were ready to do what they could to help Nixon, despite unwished-for publicity. At the first press conference after the engagement announcement they told the world how happy they were and that from then until after the election their time would be devoted to the cause.


The couple set to work: attending Nixon rallies, speaking at dinners, wearing "Nixon's the One!" buttons. They exchanged the road between Smith and Amherst for a national road, a conglomeration of all the American trails--from backwoods cow-path to superhighway. David, especially, proved to be an eloquent representative of the Nixon teachings. He knew that Nixon had made certain questionable moves, such as catering to Strom Thurmond, but he understood their motivation. "Strom Thurmond is second to God with a large segment of American voters. I guess he's third now that Wallace is second .... In practical terms Strom Thurmond held the line with the southern delegations. Now, does that mean you disregard Strom Thurmond and watch the nomination go down the river?" He commented on Nixon's determination to end the war, the problems of a vocal left causing a dangerous threat from the right, and the way Wallace was helped by Watts, Chicago and similar incidents. Here was a college spokesman that the American working class could admire.


Of course Julie was there all the time, giving her silent support, commending him on his fine progress. From time to time she talked with the press, but hers was mainly a nostalgic position, reflecting on the past with an unstated but obvious confidence in the future: "I still haven't conceded the 1960 election. I do believe

**Title: Faces of the revolution: a Cuban journal**
**Author: Walt Wagoner, Jr.**
**Page number(s): 4-6**

EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
I spent a month this summer in Cuba and 
kept a daily journal, mostly transcriptions 
of conversation. What follow are some 
excerpts from that journal. I traveled wide-
ly about the island, talking with all sorts of 
people. The extraordinary impression they 
aU gave me was one of a revolution in 
progress. Even after almost ten years, the 
atmosphere in Cuba is charged with a 
sense of newness and change. I owe a debt 
of thanks to my Cuban friends for their 
willingness to let me do as I pleased and 
their efforts to let me see and do what I 
wanted virtually without restriction. I hope 
readers can capture for themselves here 
something of what it is like in Cuba today. 
Thanks too to Anne Jones of Radcliffe, 
whom I met in Mexico as we were leaving 
for Havana and who has aided my recol-
lections from time to time. 

Waiting in the Mexico City airport for 
the Cubana flight, Anne and I met a 
motherly Cuban who works for a pub-
lishing house in Havana. She was in 
Mexico to visit her grandchildren. She 
told us stories of Fidel ("Ay, Fidel, what a 
maivelous boy!") and complained about 
conditions in the airport. 
"It's just shameful the way they take 
your pictures here, as if you were some sort 
of criminal. For heaven's sake, they caU 
Cuba a police state, and look what they do 
to you here! It makes a person nervous. I 
just won't feel calm until we're on that 
plane. Thank goodness that sort of thing 
doesn't go on in Cuba." 

Walter Wagoner, Jr., is a second-year stu-
dent at the Yale Law School. 
"You know, it makes a person so mad. 
Why, here they are in Mexico having all 
these problems with the students, and what 
do they start saying? 'Castro-Commu-
nists!' That's all they think about. Why, the 
papers talk as if we were running around 
here stirring everything up. They should 
have a little more sense; these young peo-
ple have their own problems; we certainly 
don't have to get involved. This is a very 
strange country!" 

We boarded a Russian airliner for the 
three-hour flight. The food was great, the 
best I've ever bad on a plane. Our Cuban 
lady friend kept urging us to eat on. "Of 
course they'll say that the Cubans are all 
starving to death. Well, you'll see soon 
enough." She rubbed her stomach and 
winked. 

We were met at the Jose Mart( Airport 
by several young people working for the 
Cuban Tourist Agency. We were nervous, 
still; they gave us a daiquiri, and that began 
to calm me'down. But then, damn it, 
somebody came along and took our pic-
ture! The baggage arrived a few moments 
later; no one had opened it. We were 
ushered to an elderly Cadillac and off we 
went toward Havana. 

It was evening; lights were beginning to 
illuminate the towers of the city as we 
approached. The mood of the streets was 
calm, after the hustle and smog of Mexico. 
We watched the signs: 
The Fight of the Vietnamese People is Our 
Fight 
Ten Million Tons of Sugar by 1970 
The, Girl With Green Eyes 
Che-Until Victory! 
Visit Santiago de Cuba 
Communications Will Be Maintained, In 
War As In Peace 
Homeland Or Death; We Shall Overcome 

Only one out of three streetlights were on, 
but the red sun on the brilliant green 
vegetation gave everything a deep glow. 

After supper, we walked into Havana for 
our first look at the Revolution. A few 
blocks from the hotel Anne spotted a small 
building with "PALANTE" pasted in 
hand-cut letters across the windows. We 
decided to walk in, though it was past 
eleven. We found the staff of the leading 
humor magazine, introduced ourselves and 
asked about it. 
"It's a humor magazine-cartoons and 
satire, mainly-though we do some service 
features as well. You could say we make 
fun of just about everything." The editor 
was a young man of about 28 or 30, with 
longish black curly hair, bright green eyes 
and quick smiles. He showed us copies-
16 pages on large sheets of newsprint, 
full-page and half-page cartoons in two 
and and three colors, divided almost 
equally between political and more gen-
eral themes, often very sexy. The carica-
ture of the guerilla soldier was that of 
a defiant little man, all beard, nose and 
boots, often bespectacled, with a gun 
sticking out of the top of the boots where 
they joined the base of his neck; a huge ci-
gar and a beanie topped it off. 

The women were extraordinarly cur-
vacious, all hips and breasts tugging at 
miniskirts and thin blouses. The sex of the 
cartoons was explicit and unrestrained. 
Even the issue following the death of Che 
was grimly, darkly, bitterly humorous: 
guns disguised as cigars protruding from 
beards of defiant soldiers. 

Anne asked him how he got to be editor: 
if he were a member of the party, for in-
stance. He looked a little shy in response. 
"Well, actually, I'm not a member of the 
party; you don't have to be. Maybe I will 
be someday, but I have just a few little de-
fects." 

I asked him if they criticized the gov-
ernment in the magazine. 
"We joke about it a lot, and we try to 
point out what goes wrong. But we don't 
criticize for its own sake and we try not to 
be negative. We think of ourselves as 
revolutionaries and humorists at the same 
time. We try to be truthful and have fun 
with it, too." 

We walked on a few blocks until we 
came to a basement apartment with a 
small sign outside reading "CDR" (Com-
mittees in the Defense of the Revolution), 
and in we went. Large poster of Che on 
the waUs, Marx and Fidel under glass on 
the coffee table, ten folks sitting around the 
room, aU ages, generous blend of colors. 
We just asked who they were and what 
they did. All neighbors, they answered, de-
fending the Revolution at the block level. 


What did they mean? "See this plastic 
bag?" answered a lady. "We get together 
and fill it with dirt that they truck in-to 
the corner. Then we put a coffee seedling in 
it-thousands of bags in a good weekend 
-they go out to the fields in another truck 
and are planted-all around Havana in the 
Havana Cord6n Plan." 

"What do you think about the Revolu-
tion?" 
"Fantastic-the most beautiful thing in 
the world. Here we are, all neighbors, 
black and white. You know, in the old days 
me and Maria here couldn't really get to-
gether. We had our own circles, the places 
I went to, the parties and so on, well, a 
black person couldn't go. We were friends, 
of course, but it just wasn't the same. 
Now-the Revolution-black and white, 
it's all the same." They smiled sweetly at 
each other. 

"Ah, but Fidel, Fidel." A sinewy old 
black man was on his feet now. "We de-
pend on Fidel and his wonderful example, 
'nuestro Hder maximo'; we would be no-
where without our Fidel. What vision! 
What strength! With our Fidel we'll just 
keep moving forward until there's no stop-
ping us!" 

Four women were speaking at once 
now, as if to cut the old fellow off. 
"Look," said one of them, ''you should 
tell the Americans that we don't hate them, 
that we think of them as brothers, 'nuestro 
hermano pals,' but we are determined to 
make this Revolution a complete success. 
It's not the people there, not the people at 
all. But that Mr. Johnson! Well, that's 
something else again. I really wish you'd 
try to get that across when you go back." 

We walked out an hour later with one of 
the young men of the block. "You noticed 
how that old man kept talking about 
Fidel," he said. "Well, frankly, it bothered 
me. That's something Fidel wants to dis-
courage. He doesn't make so many 
speeches now, not like he used to-trying 
to get people to figure things out for them-
selves. That's one of our big problems: 
some people depend too much on Fidel." 

I walked about a mile into Havana this 
afternoon, just to look around. The streets 
are colorless: faded paint and tom posters, 
but no litter. Once in a while you overbear 
a passing comment from one of the older 
ladies-how you have to get in line at 
five in the morning to buy your ration of 
meat and how they might run out when 
there are only five people ahead of you in 
the line. 

Kids all over the place; schools are on 
vacation. 
"Frances?" a little boy called out to me. 
He was sitting with a friend on the edge 
of the sidewalk. I shook my bead. 
"Ruso? Aleman? Checo? Ingles? Itali-
ano?" I kept shaking no. 
"Well what are you then?" 
"American," I answered. 
"My God! I've never seen an Ameri-
can! How did you get here? What are they 
going to do to you when you go back?" 

All of a sudden, I was being mobbed by 
children. They were filling the street. 
Traffic was blocked. Anxious mothers were 
peering over their heads. Older men were 
muttering with each other and eyeing me 
with suspicion. We were on the edge of 
chaos. 
"How high is the Empire State Building? 
Taller than the ones in Havana? Do you 
have lots of cars in America? What about 
the black people? Are you a Black Pan-
ther?" I hated to disappoint them. We 
streamed over to a nearby park and talked 
for hours. One boy wondered if I had ever 
heard of Che. Yes, I told him, sometimes 
we carry his picture. "Then how do you es-
cape from the police when they come after 
you?" he asked. 

We talked most of the evening with 
Miguel, a poet who lives here in Havana. 
"In a way," he was saying, "it's too bad 
Che left. We needed him. He was the op-
position here. He had Fidel's kind of 
charisma. He could touch Fidel. I can't re-
member the number of times I've spoken 
with Fidel, intimately. We are very close. 
But somehow I can't imagine touching 
him, just reaching out and touching him in 
conversation, like this. One simply doesn't 
imagine such things; there is something 
about his presence. But Che could do that, 
the only one. That was a mark of his 
stature. Che was a brilliant man, far more 
so than the average. We have great need 
for more like that. Education is still a great 
problem here. 
"In government, Che stood for more 
economic centralization. He had extensive 
debates with the French economist 
Bettleheim about that. Che would write in 
the magazine Our Industry very powerful 
stuff, even though it sometimes seemed 
like a contest to see who could quote more

"I should have died in Bolivia. I would 
have, gladly. Cbe went there and be lost;

wasn't good politics/

The Cox Commission Report: Crisis at Columbia: Report of the Fact-Finding Commission Appointed to Investigate the Disturbances at Columbia University. A Vintage Special, 222 pp. 
The events of last April and May at Columbia University provided an institution which yearns for more public recognition with enough publicity to last it a decade. 
Now that we have been treated to a nationally televised spectacular of policemen having a ball with young people in Chicago, the public memory of the Columbia uprising has dimmed. The recent publication of Crisis at Columbia, the report compiled by the faculty-appointed commission headed by former Solicitor General Archibald Cox, should refresh our recollection of that turbulent period. The report is likely to become the definitive work for parents, university administrators and non-radical students on what happened at Columbia last spring. As such it is flawed, for unlike Mark Twain, who told the truth with some stretches, the Cox report tells the truth with some contractions. 

When the Cox Commission conducted hearings last spring, the leaders of the two Columbia groups most involved in the crisis, Students for a Democratic Society and the Student Afro-American Society, refused to participate, claiming that the Commission was unrepresentative of the University and was bound to compile a report favoring the particular interests of the faculty. There is some merit in this charge. The report emphasizes as a cause of unrest Columbia's relative decline in four years from fifth to seventeenth place among American universities in faculty salaries. It does not suggest, however, that any student seized a building in order to get his professor a bigger paycheck. 

Some students might find the style of the report patronizing. Even a master of academic cliche would sound foolish making statements like, "The present generation of young people in our universities is the best informed, the most intelligent, and the most idealistic this country has ever known." Similarly, the drafters of the report try to get with it by speaking of the police "bust" and Columbia "jocks." The Columbia Spectator had the good sense to write about the "raid" and the "athletes." 
Robert Schu/zinger, a second-year graduate student in American history, is an alumnus of Columbia and was on the Morningside Heights campus when the buildings were occupied. 

Nevertheless, the report does make a sincere effort to tell what happened and why and to suggest what Columbia (and other universities) ought to do to prevent similar outbreaks in the future. It is most forthright in explaining what the uprising was not. No sinister conclave in Maryland of left-wing mischief-makers plotted the uprising, as an article in the New Republic averred. Nor was Mark Rudd, the chairman of SDS at Columbia, in any sense a revolutionary mastermind. The report makes it quite clear that Rudd, the other SDS leaders and the leaders of the Student Afro-American Society were surprised by the rapid turn of events and had to make decisions after being confronted with unplanned situations. 

The seizure of five buildings was a spontaneous act made possible by a long history of student frustrations and unhappiness reinforced by administration intransigence and blundering. The fact that nearly a thousand students participated in the sit-ins and that substantially more honored a student strike after police came to clear the campus is correctly cited as proof that whatever happened was not the work of an insignificant band of agitators and firebrands. 

If unscrupulous radicals did not engineer a destructive confrontation with the university authorities, then what caused the spring rising? Part of the explanation is familiar-too familiar. The Cox Commission says that we live in disrupted times, that young people question old values, that the war in Vietnam and the civil rights struggle have aroused our youth, and that, besides, there seems to be a world-wide rising of the young against the old. General explanations like this explain nothing. 

When the report speaks of the particular conditions within a single urban university which caused it to blow up, we begin to understand how a climate of mutual distrust and even contempt developed at Columbia. Three issues were involved in the Columbia crisis: (1) the University's expansion and its relations with its neighbors in Morningside Heights and Harlem, (2) the University's relations with the defense establishment and (3) the University's structure and the role students legitimately should have in planning university policies. 

Like other urban universities wishing to expand facilities, Columbia has come into sharp conflict with its neighbors, and the report makes a valiant effort to refrain from evaluating the justice of Columbia's expansion plans. It can see no harm in the gymnasium Columbia planned to construct in Morningside Park. It believes that the University was not freely grabbing public lands and finds that the amount of space it allocated for the use of community members was adequate. It does indicate, however, that only in 1966, i.e. eight years after the original plan for the gym was drafted, did university officials meet with community leaders to discover what their objections to the gym were. 

Columbia's general policy of improving the quality of the Morningside Heights neighborhood by removing the neighbors gets rougher treatment in the report. During the bearings last spring witnesses testified that Columbia had evicted some seven thousand residents, mostly low-income blacks, Puerto Ricans and aged whites, from Morningside Heights in the last ten years. The Commission was particularly shocked by the refusal of Columbia's affiliated Pharmacy School to honor a university pledge to relocate the people it displaced. The Commission refused to judge the merits of the testimony of those witnesses who claimed that the University had no interest in what happened to the residents of Morningside Heights. It did note the obvious strength of conviction of those who testified. The Commission did observe generally that a university cannot be run as an ordinary business venture-a truth that Columbia, with its real estate policies and its farcical activity as a cigarette filter manufacturer, apparently never learned. 

The Cox Commission found that the University's ties with the Institute for Defense Analysis were not a sufficient cause for the seizure of buildings. When the report describes the grudging manner in which Columbia administrators revealed there was a connection, the atmosphere of suspicion becomes clearer. But it takes a careful reader to glean from the report the fact that a graduate school dean once denied any university connection with I.D.A. and that the president of the University once stated that Columbia had never received money from the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct secret research. The report judges the first statement to be legitimate since not the University but only individual faculty members had contracts with I.D.A. 

President Kirk's denial of a CIA connection is found unexceptionable, since the results of the research paid for by the CIA were made public, even if the source of the money was indeed kept a dark secret. The Cox Commission says university officials were not "insincere" in their answers to student questions concerning government contracts. Perhaps they were at least "disingenuous"? 

The members of the Commission, most of whom were lawyers, were greatly concerned by the lack of formal disciplinary procedures at Columbia to assure students a role in judging their peers. Instead, all disciplinary power was jealously preserved by the president and the deans. A rule forbidding political demonstrations inside university buildings had been promulgated by President Kirk in September, 1967, in spite of opposition from a Committee on Student Life and the Columbia University Student Council. In February, 1968, the University singled out for discipline five students of a hundred who had demonstrated inside a building against the presence on campus of a recruiter from Dow Chemical. The fact that these five were leaders of SDS indicated a political inspiration behind the disciplinary procedure. 

The report criticizes the administration for having these students suspended by the dean of Columbia College instead of following the extraordinary procedure of public trial by a student-faculty-administration tribunal which had been employed a year before. The report somehow neglects to mention that the previous disciplinary hearing had been made public only after 250 students forced their way into the hearing room. 

Perhaps the report's greatest fault is its refusal to take a firm stand on the violence which occurred when police were called to clear the campus buildings on the night of April 29. Violence, the Commission concludes, was inevitable, and not too much could be done to reduce it. Only one commission member was moved to speak some hard sense about how policemen should conduct themselves. Anthony Amsterdam of the University of Pennsylvania Law School offered his opinion that, One who resists a policeman doubtless ought to be held morally accountable for the policeman's legitimate use of force to overcome his resistance. Events may also very well hold him physically accountable for creating the risk that the police force will get out of hand. I see no moral utility for taxing him, in the realm of conscience, for the policeman's use of excessive and illegitimate force. It seems to me that he may properly expect that the policeman will not use excessive force. The propriety of this expectation is not based upon factual probabilities, but upon a standard of conduct for police which society cannot afford to relax. 

By refusing to judge the conduct of the police the Commission also managed to ignore the charge raised by the Columbia Spectator that much vandalism occurred in one of the occupied buildings after the students had been cleared and only police remained inside. 

What is the Commission's solution? They appeal to students who find their university administrators transparently uncandid to show these men more civility and goodwill. To the administrators they make the modest proposal that they stop treating faculty members as employees, students as customers, critics as evil men and the surrounding community as an unhealthy swamp which will go away if it is ignored or swallowed. To all members of the University the Commission appeals for a willingness to share power and to respect opposing views. 

In the end, the Commission begs the question by proposing that the solution is greater tolerance and understanding among those concerned. If only people were nicer the world would indeed be better. The Cox Report should have been less interested in improving people and more concerned with changing institutions. The best that can be hoped today for the "new" Columbia is an institution in which the administration tolerates the students. In their turn, perhaps, students will become more skeptically amused than enraged by the inevitable administration verbal legerdemain. Maybe students will soon derive some satisfaction from knowing that a Columbia education and a sojourn on Morningside Heights makes them wise in the ways our world is run.

People were breaking into small groups 
and talking excitedly. Four smaller chil-
dren ran up to me and asked if I knew how 
to dance the Hankipanki. I denied any 
knowledge of it. "So what do you do when 
you dance?" 
"Anything that comes into my mind," I 
said, trying to avoid the showdown. 
"Great! Jet's dance," answered a twelve-year-old girl. 
"I'll dance if we all dance," I offered. 
A boy started to bang out the Hankipanki 
on his guitar. The older girl began to 
dance in front of me and took my hand. I 
can't be certain, but I don't think it was 
the Hankipanki. But it was good. It wasn't 
until then that I noticed her wedding ring. 
After the dance I asked about that. 
"Ha. Don't worry." She was laughing 
with some of the women. 
"You're damn right I'll worry." 
"OK; I'll tell you about that. My hus-
band ... well, when we were both in the 
militia about three years ago we weren't 
married yet, we were just novios. There 
was a meeting one night and Fidel came. I 
don't know why, but he asked my boy-
friend why he wasn't married and he said, 
'Comandante, the truth is I have a girl-
friend, that one there. We'd like to get 
married, but just now the time isn't right. 
My parents are against it. It's a delicate 
thing, really, comandante. Well, you see, 
my girl is a little on the dark side, and my· 
parents aren't quite ready for that, com-
prende?' So Fidel just looks at him for a 
long time, then he slams his fist and says, 
'You're getting married!' Fidel thought we 
ought to have a military wedding. You 
know, swords and all that. I had on a very 
cute little white wedding dress. Short. My 
boyfriend wore his uniform. Fidel said we 
ought to have a nice honeymoon, and he 
paid for us to go to Varadero Beach. You 
could say Fidel was really interested in 
that wedding. We got divorced after that. 
So you can stop worrying." 


We got up at 5:00AM on Wednesday, 
breakfast at six and out to work by seven, 
digging more pits for the coffee seedlings. 
We had a contest with one of the other 
brigades to see who could dig the most pits 
in eight hours. I was told that the four-
hour average for one guy is 90 or 100. I 
got in 174 in the morning; one guy did 252. 
An older man, about 65, was the low man 
with 90. And he was roundly congratu-
lated. The spirit continued to be great, 
reaching a peak at mid-morning melon 
break for watermelon, lemonade and 
dirty jokes. 

The afternoon was slower. A threat of 
rain drove most of the men back to the 
camp. "WeiJ, you know what Fidel says," 
I was told. " 'Not a single wet worker in 
this revolution!' Now don't get the wrong 
idea; if there is something that has to be 
done, and it has to be done right away, 
we do it, rain or no rain. Why once I cut 
cane for 17 hours straight-it would have 
dried up if we hadn't worked like that. 
But if we can keep dry we like to." 

During that break, the talk turned to 
examples of good working spirit. 
"You should see that Cuban Central 
Committee when they came out to cut 
cane. No water, no rest stops, just flying 
cane. You get one of those guys out in 
front of you and you really want to work. 
You know, if Fidel came by he'd just grab 
a hoe and do more work than anyone else." 

There was a very heavy guy with a heart 
condition who told me, "I can't do any 
hard fast work-it's the condition I have; 
it could kill me. I can only do a few dozen 
pits a day, but everyone should do what 
he can." I suggested that if they keep up 
this pace, it should all pay off in lots of 
food within a few years. "Well, you can't 
really say that in 'X' years we'll be well 
off. When you think of Vietnam .... You 
know, as long as there is anyone in the 
world who needs our help, such as in Viet-
nam, we'll just keep on working like this." 

The clouds blew over, and we continued 
to work until about five. It had been a 
very rough day; my hands were sore, and 
my whole body felt lilce it would be hard 
to get up in the morning. I was leaving 
that night at midnight for Havana and then 
for home. There was to be a talent show 
in the camp in my honor, and I was to 
sing some songs. I was thinking about that 
when one of the men approached me 
quietly on the road back to camp. "They 
say you're leaving tonight to go back to 
the United States. I hope you'll write. It's 
been good having you here. I want you to 
know one thing, and I am very serious. 
You know, I have a wonderful family and 
a good job--a very good life. But never-
theless, I've written to the Party in Havana 
offering to go and fight in Vietnam if that 
is necessary. That would be the greatest 
honor in the world, to fight alongside those 
men and women. And I've been thinking, 
talking to you, about the United States. 
You've made a great impression here; you 
have a great task before you in that coun-
try. I can understand why you want to go 
back. It's a beautiful land with fine people; 
I traveled there some years ago. Someday 
I hope to return. Let me just say this to 
you. The struggle you will have in that 
country will not be easy. Please remember 
this. If you ever feel you need help, I 
am willing to come and fight alongside 
you. It would be a fine thing to fight for 
such a wonderful country as the United 
States."

Daddy won it. But my father says the 
Presidency of the United States is never 
stolen, and he wouldn't want a recount be-
cause he wouldn't want to win that way." 

And now Julie has dropped out of 
Smith, apparently having gotten all she 
can out of the school, but David attends 
Amherst Tuesdays through Thursdays, de-
voting the weekends to jetting to whatever 
spot the Nixon campaign chooses. While at 
school he not only seriously devotes him-
self to studying-a fraternity friend says 
that David has never missed his Tuesday 
class at 9:00-he also talks with local 
leaders about Republican strategy. Yes, 
here is a coUege spokesman that the Amer-
ican working class can admire. 

They have progressed a long way, this 
pair, from the simple pleasures of Route 9, 
with never a wisp of an idea of what the 
future would reveal. And one can imagine 
them twenty years or more from now, 
when the road between two colleges will 
become the path to the Presidency, when 
the nation will turn to this glowing couple 
as new redeemers in the image of Nixon. 
Julie of course will still smile and say that 
her husband is the greatest man ever and 
of course she takes all her orders from 
him; David will smile too and refuse to 
meet any candidate in a televised debate 
and promise to get us out of whatever 
war we're in at the time. And he probably 
will. '"I.E

ing and expression, views toward the value 
of education and how it fits into their 
lives, as well as some of the more psychic 
and personal needs and desires of women 
As it is, Yale Graduate School, by its very 
nature of being a career-oriented, profes 
sionally academic training school, forces 
women, whose identity is not defined by 
their achievements but by their insights 
and perceptions, to renounce that which is 
essential to their integrity-their femin-
inity. 

When Yale leaps into coeducation, it 
had better consider what educating women 
really means. But then, maybe it will take 
several thousand women to make Yale 
aware of what it has been doing to its 
women and to help make it a natural at-
mosphere for living as well as learning. 
For the sake of the men at least as much 
as for the women, I hope coeducation will 
be complete and soon. It is only when 
male undergraduates, graduate students 
and faculty can view women as a natural 
part of their lives that women can again 
be free from the tensions which make their 
years here so often a dehumanizing, de-
sexualizing drag.

**Living end**
**Page number(s): 11**

Even that bastion of solidarity, the New 
York Times, is beginning to show a few 
cracks. 

Walter Kerr thinks they have ugly 
bodies. 

Eric Bentley denounced Clive Barnes in 
his article, "I reject the Living Theater." 
Clive Barnes returned fire by accusing 
Bentley of "propagandistic journalism of 
a high degree of sophistication." 

But no one captured the Living Theatre 
quite the way a Minnesota editor did as he 
read a wire dispatch about Paradise Now 
at Yale. Readers of the St. Paul Dispatch 
were offered the following editorial: 
"The so-called 'living theater' may have 
become the living end. 
"Or so it seemed in New Haven late 
Thursday night. The Yale Drama School 
is currently presenting New Paradise, a 
play which ends with a member of the cast 
shouting, 'The streets belong to the people,' 
at which point he leads the rest of the cast, 
and any game members of the audience, 
out into the street where they undress 
themselves. 
"Well, as anyone knows, it's easy to 
bomb in New Haven. But this play more 
than bombed; it ended with 10 people get-
ting arrested by the New Haven police, a 
fine force, but not one noted for its love of 
the theater, living or dead. 
"Those arrested were charged with in-
decent exposure and a breach of the peace. 
To which you might say, 'Lousy cops! 
They foiled a work of art.' 
"But the error, surely, is with the play. 
Anything which calls itself theater, no 
matter how it applies to or duplicates 
reality, is supposed to be make-believe. 
When you write a play to have people 
running about naked on public streets, the 
play has breached the limits of make-
believe. 
"In short, there can be no such thing as 
'living theater,' that is drama that some-
how is meant to come alive in the real 
world, for if it truly becomes part of that 
world, if it becomes 'living,' then it is no 
longer theater. 
"Surely, the police of New Haven prob-
ably haven't thought this through, and 
certainly they don't have to. It's quite 
simple: people aren't supposed to run 
around in public with no clothes on, 
whether they're players or not. 
" 'Living theater' has little future in the 
world of the living-
it should stay with 
the world of the theater. In the meantime, 
Old Blues could spread the story that this 
really happened at Harvard." 


**Letters**

To the editors: 
It is easy to understand why many who 
wish to advance the goals of peace and of 
civil and human rights have been unde-
cided about how, or even whether, to vote 
in this year's Presidential election. Having 
shared this indecision, we have now con-
cluded that we should vote-and vote for 
for Hubert Humphrey and Edmund 
Muskie. We want to explain why. 

Everyone who fails to vote for President 
adds to George Wallace's percentage of 
total votes cast and helps to promote his 
influence in the future. We believe that 
his powerful appeal to prejudice and 
violence must be repudiated now, before 
it gains further support. Moreover, write-
in votes for a scattering of other candidates 
will be unavailing for this purpose; what 
newsmen and campaign managers will talk 
about are the Humphrey-Nixon-Wallace 
figures. 

presupposes that there is no choice be-
tween Nixon-Agnew and Humphrey-
Muskie. We believe there is a choice. We 
feel that the Republicans are far less likely 
than the Democrats to make headway 
against the militarism, intolerance and in-
justice that disturb us so deeply. We are 
reassured by Muskie and .appalled that 
Agnew could become President. 

gives an uncontested vote to the people 
with whom he most strongly disagrees. By 
refusing to vote, many disillusioned Dem-
ocrats and Independents would give away 
the next two to eight years, in the hope that 
Democratic politicians will come to them. 
But there is good evidence that, as Nelson 
Polsby says, "It is neither the meek nor the 
pure of heart who inherit the wreckage of 
a political party when the party is buried 
in a landslide. Incumbent office-holders 
and party 'regulars' pick up the pieces." 

Furthermore, what happens during 
these years will determine the course of 
our future. We fear that even if 1972 or 
1976 brings the election of a man we ad-
mire unreservedly, his effectiveness may 
be crippled by the mistakes of his im-
mediate predecessor. If we really want to 
overcome the apathy and hatred that 
threaten our country, we will do well to 
participate realistically in the choice of 
our next President.
