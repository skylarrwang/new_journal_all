EXTRACT ARTICLE CONTENT:
Chancellor's success with domestic stories caught the eye of the 
NBC bosses, who assigned him to 
the NBC Vienna bureau in 1958. It 
was the first of a series of overseas 
assignments that would span 12 
years, and would culminate in his 
designation as chief of the NBC team 
that accompanied President Nixon 
on his Russia and China trips in 
1971. From Vienna he was transferred 
to London, traveled around 
the Mediterranean Sea directing 
David Brinkley's "Our Man in the 
Mediterranean", and in 1960 covered 
the trial of U-2 pilot Gary Powers 
from the Moscow bureau. 

That same year he covered the 
American presidential campaign and 
election. He won the reputation of 
"Iron Man" from his NBC colleagues 
during this assignment 
when, while waiting for John Kennedy 
to arrive in Hyannis to make 
his victory statement, he talked on 
the air for 90 minutes without a 
break. 

About that time NBC was remodeling 
the Today show, their 
early morning program, and putting 
it under the auspices of the news 
department. "Iron Man" Chancellor 
was called on to become the Today 
host, a coveted assignment but one 
that he was reluctant to take. His 
first love was still reporting, and he 
itched to get back. 

He got his chance after hosting 
Today for a year. NBC made him 
chief of its Brussels bureau, where he 
covered the European Common Market. 
He happily filed stories from 
Europe and at home until 1965. 

At one point, his wit turned a potentially 
embarrassing scene into a 
classic TV report. As a floorman for 
the 1964 Republican Convention, he 
was accosted in the middle of a report 
by a sergeant-at-arms who was 
attempting to clear the aisles. "It's 
awfully hard to remain dignified at a 
time like this," he reported as the 
man hustled him off the floor before 
a national television audience. His 
adlibbed conclusion: "This is John 
Chancellor, somewhere in custody." 

Lyndon Johnson appointed him 
director of the Voice of America in 
1965-he was the first working journalist 
to be so honored. But by 1967 
he was back at NBC reporting on a 
wide variety of stories: the 1972 elections, 
Apollo space flights and the 
recent Senate Watergate hearings. 

These posts with NBC have not 
only enabled him to see a good deal 
of the world (he loves to travel), but 
have also made him an extremely 
valuable member of the NBC News 
organization. NBC spent over 
$150,000 a year shuttling him back 
and forth between Washington and 
New York from 1970 until this year 
("Indulging my habits," as he puts 
it). In Washington he spent 
time with his family and maintained 
his contacts and friendships with 
government people ("You shouldn't 
write about people without knowing 
them," he believes) four days each 
week, and spent the other three days 
working at NBC headquarters in 
New York. 

He grew weary of weekly commuting, 
however, so recently he moved 
to New York, where he can be seen 
bicycling in Central Park and is trying 
to develop a circle of friends outside 
of broadcasting. 

Making the transition from field 
reporter to anchorman required considerable 
adjustment. "I was scared 
to death when I began," he recalls, 
"but I have a little more confidence 
in myself now. I feel less foolish doing 
the news." He finds it emotionally 
helpful to visualize his audience 
not in terms of millions but as one 
or two people gathered around a TV 
set. 

The transition from legman to 
desk man evokes ambivalent feelings 
from him. "Having traveled a lot all 
my life I genuinely miss it. But, on 
the other hand, I'm forty-six years 
old, and your legs begin to go after a 
while. And your enthusiasm for the 
fray lessens a bit. But I'm not going 
to be an anchorman forever. I'll 
probably get back to some limited 
kind of traveling in ten years or so." 

Through his career in the news 
business, Chancellor has witnessed, 
written, and reported a lot of news, 
and he says it tends to lose its luster 
every once in a while. "The news is 
episodic-much of it is the same," he 
comments. "It's a cycle of disasters 
and floods and government upheavals 
and things like that." He 
worries that his on-the-air performance 
might become too routine. 

There are good nights and bad 
nights. "A friend of mine watches 
the show occasionally, and sometimes 
he calls up afterwards and 
says, 'Boy, you were terrible tonight. 
You were just reading it. You were 
bored by it and therefore all of us 
were bored by it.' But he adds that 
nights like those have been rare in 
the recent climate of Watergate and 
the Middle East War. 

One night last month, after Nixon 
fired Watergate Special Prosecutor 
Archibald Cox, Chancellor opened 
the show saying that in his 23 years 
as a reporter he'd never seen such an 
extraordinary news day. Such major 
developments help to keep his 
interest up. "I hope to keep my enthusiasm 
for the news while I'm in 
this job," he says. "That's an important 
element. If you believe in it, 
think it's important, it comes across 
better and is more meaningful 
to people." 

His years as a political reporter 
(he has covered every presidential 
election since 1952) have convinced 
him that the press plays a vital intermediary 
role between the government 
and the public. 

He points out that the government 
has learned to use the press to 
its own advantage. For example, releasing 
bad news at a time when it 
may well go unnoticed: "Sometimes, 
I think, a Saturday afternoon in August 
isn't a bad time to put out a 
piece of news you have to put out but 
don't want to put out. If it's a little 
embarrassing, you issue a typewritten 
statement-you just give it 
to the reporters and don't take any 
questions. 

"The announcement of the President's 
compromise on the secret 
White House tapes, which he took 
back the following Monday, came 
out at 8:15 on a Friday night. I've 
heard it said that was a deliberate 
attempt by the White House to keep 
it off the nightly news programs. 

"But I don't agree with that. I 
think that in many instances, particularly 
now in the White House, they 
are having meetings and checking 
with people and deciding what 
they're going to do, and they just get 
the news out when they can." 

Still, he admits that the government 
can and does try to manage the 
news. "The media-national and local-are 
manipulated to a very considerable 
extent," he claims. "And to 
a considerable extent we're passive, 
much more than people realize. The 
way the game of government and citizenship 
is played in this country, I 
think we probably ought not to be 
other than passive in transmitting 
what the government wants transmitted. 
Where I think the American 
press doesn't do a good enough job is 
in following up and asking questions. 

"In other words, I see the press as 
two tracks. One, if the President 
says something, he's got to have an 
avenue of saying that to the people-any 
government has to. But then we 
ought to question that, put it to all 
kinds of tests. That's the other side 
of the press." 

In the wake of the Washington 
Post's investigative reporting which 
broke the Watergate story, however, 
Chancellor expresses his discontent


**A Nightly News Day**
**Page number(s): 5**

Producing the Nightly News every weekday night becomes a continuing 
battle against time. News happens 24 hours a day, but the program 
lasts only 25 minutes (after commercials), long enough to broadcast 
about the number of words of two-thirds of an average newspaper page. 
It is the work of 12 Nightly News staffers to distill the day's most 
important events into a concise broadcast. Here is how they do it: 
11:00 The conference call. Executive Producer Les Crystal and his 
associate producers confer with NBC's news bureaus across the country-
Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington. Each bureau reports the major 
news events in its area and details the number of camera crews and 
correspondents available for assignment. When the conference call ends 
the producers have a good idea what film reports will be ready by 
evening and which regional stories demand further attention. 

11:30-3:00 Foreign bureaus check in by telephone. Overseas stories 
are assigned. Lunch. 

1:00 The "rundown" meeting. The producers assemble to review the 
day's news and how it is being covered. They judge the importance of 
each news item, assign times (usually between 10 seconds and three 
minutes) and determine the order for broadcast. 

3:45 The rundown meeting produces a preliminary time budget-a 
rough outline of the show. Chancellor gathers the wire-service copy, 
studies it, and prepares to write. 

5:00 "Feeds"-film reports from the bureaus-begin to come in over 
the two TV monitors in the newsroom. The left screen carries domestic 
feeds sent by cable or microwave, the right international feeds sent by 
satellite. Associate Producer Joe Angotti watches each feed and decides 
whether changes need to be made. If so, the feed is repeated (most feeds 
are broadcast live from a studio and recorded on video tape in New 
York). 

5:30 The news writing team sets to work-Chancellor at the corner desk, 
Editor Sandy Goodman and Senior Editor Gil Millstein at adjoining 
ones. Copy from their typewriters is passed to the producers for 
checking, then to a production assistant for cues and timing (each 
news item is read at Chancellor speed and timed by stopwatch.) 

5:55 The news is written. The tension eases at the writers' end, but 
continues for the producers. Chancellor gets his shoes shined. Feeds 
continue to come in. 

6:20 Chancellor leaves the newsroom with his still-incomplete script. 
The original of the script is tested on the TelePrompter, and the studio 
is ready. 

6:25 In the newsroom, final timing of the script continues. The missing 
pages are delivered to the studio by runner. 

6:29 In the control room, a director, producer and production assistant 
scramble to re-order the news sequence to cover for an overseas feed 
that has not come in. Chancellor is notified by intercom. 

6:30 The show begins. It is fed live to many areas of the country, but is 
taped to be broadcast at 7:00 in New York and elsewhere. The control 
room crew count seconds, give cues, flip switches. 

6:59 Despite last-minute changes, the show falls short of precision by 
only five seconds. Chancellor: "Good night for NBC News."
