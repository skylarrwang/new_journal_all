We seU for less because we don't want to be 
undersold. Our huge buying power (over 20 
stores throughout the eastern United States) 
assures you of getting the best equipment 
from us for less. 
---warranty--
we·re the original people to offer more than 
just what the manufacturer does. The other 
stores in ·town continue to sell the copies for 
the same price we sell the original. Besides, 
no one can compete with us in co-operationf

If you're looking for a stereo this is one question you should have asked yourself by now. It's tf:le question we kept asking ourselves until we 
finally began Audio Components (over 5 years ago) so we began and will always continue to discount stereos. Thanks to our satisfied cus-
tomers, we excel in buying for less, keeping our overhead down, so we can guarantee we sell it for less. All year long we seH different brands 
of Hi-Fi for less. For example examine this Pioneer system.
