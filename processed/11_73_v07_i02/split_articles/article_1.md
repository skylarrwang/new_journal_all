Comment
The New Journal humbly accepts 
congratulations for its graphic vic-
tory in the recent Bladderball game. 
Despite a late arrival on the field, 
and gaps at five key positions, our 
team undauntedly crept to victory. 
We realize that our assertion of 
victory contradicts the claims of 
other campus publication teams. 
Deadline pressure forced each to go 
to press before the last play was exe-
cuted, the last block was thrown, or 
the last impetus was imparted. 


Lamentably, they missed the 
Journal team's brilliant, last-minute 
flanking maneuver, which clinched 
our victory.
