Oedipus Rep 
(continued from page 10) 
January could lose a lot of political 
bite. Anthony Ulasewicz may still be 
the butt of jokes, but only for those 
who can remember who he is. 

Marks admits that he and other 
Rep members have been a little 
worried that "Classics" views 
Watergate too much from a summer 
of '73 perspective. At the same time 
however, they feel that the form of 
Â· the show solves much, though not 
all, of the topicality problem. "The 
production views Watergate as a 
whole and not just as a series of indi-
vidual events," Marks notes, and the 
directors have chosen "between what 
is ephemeral and what isn't." 

Still, some parts of the script 
have changed with the news. As orig-
inally written, the "Samlet" script 
gave much attention to the murder 
of a character named "Spirago." 
"But people have forgotten about 
Agnew," Geidt says, "so we cut that 
speech in half." Other sketches may 
well need changes to incorporate new 
events, but on the whole, Brustein 
notes, "History is tending to confirm 
our material." 

Like any theatrical work-and 
''Watergate Classics'' is certainly 
that-the show is written to enter-
tain its audience. But the Rep staff 
hopes the show will do more than 
simply draw laughs. They think it 
will help to clear up confusion about 
the significance of Watergate, and 
hopefully produce a jarring moral 
effect on the audience. As Marks 
emphasizes, "we're writing for 
content, not just to be cute." 

The political tone of "Classics," 
as the authors do not hesitate to 
admit, expresses their own political 
feelings. Marks is careful to explain, 
however, that creating a politically-
charged revue is "quite distinct from 
an actor using his name to support a 
candidate. It's not like saying 'I'm 
famous so listen to what I have to 
say.' Our goal is not to preach but to 
use talent to express feelings and to 
entertain. We are doing it through 
the art form." 

Critics may argue that this per-
sonal expression in the Watergate 
revue does not belong on the stage of 
a major repertory company. To that 
criticism, Director Brustein replies: 
"The Yale Rep is a theater that looks 
backwards and forwards in history. I

felt that it was consistent with that 
philosophy to take a classic and give 
it a contemporary interpretation. 

"We personally, and hopefully a 
larger group of people, feel that the 
country needs a theatrical purge to 
express some free-floating feelings. 
The purpose of the production is to 
show that theater is related to real 
crises." 

This relation between the theater 
and real crises is not always clear. 
The audience may ask of "Water-
gate Classics" "Is this Art?" with 
the same incredulity as a parent ask-
ing if the Rolling Stones actually 
play Music. But drama has never 
existed in a vacuum. It has always 
been a means to deal with the real 
world. The re-interpreted plays in 
"Classics" are political, but this 
dimension does not automatically 
remove them from the realm of art. 
Nor does it make the Rep a political 
theater. Brustein notes that Chekov 
once said, "Great writers must con-
cern themselves with politics only 
insofar as it is necessary to put up a 
defense against politics.'' 

Of course, no discussion of Water-
gate can avoid dealing with the ulti-
mate political possibility of impeach-
ment. Impeachment could have 
several different effects on "Water-
gate Classics." It could, for example, 
complete the parallel between 
Oedipus and Nixon. On the other 
hand, it could make the show past 
history in a hurry. 

Even though the creators of 
"Classics" feel the work may have a 
validity that could withstand 
Nixon's demise, members of the cast 
still worry that Nixon may be im-
peached. But Marks, who founded a 
Teenage Republican Club in Hamil-
ton County, Ohio, quickly adds that 
the worry "is strictly show-biz." 0
