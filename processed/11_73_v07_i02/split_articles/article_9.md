**Title: On being physician and cancer investigator (A difficult thing to bring off)**
**Author: Beverly Kelsey**
**Page number(s): 11-12**

The best of today's scientific investi-
gators know that they cannot afford 
to bury their minds in laboratories or 
live in cubicles with obscure jour-
nals. At Yale this old stereotype 
appears to live in legend only-a 
notice for a meeting of "The Ameri-
can Society for the Perpetuation of 
Obscure Journals" is posted 
facetiously on the bulletin board of 
Dr. Joseph Bertino, chief of the Yale 
Medical School's section on oncol-
ogy, the study and treatment of 
cancer. 


What may be trend elsewhere is 
already history at Yale's Hunter 
Clinic: cancer investigators have 
been, and are, merging pure scien-
tific research with the human and 
ethical dimensions of science, dealing 
with public misconceptions, experi-
menting with human beings under 
strict guidelines with "informed con-
sent", and becoming deeply com-
mitted to doctor-researcher-family 
interactions. 


The misconceptions about cancer 
extend beyond the science pages of 
some glossy magazines, which assert 
there's no present cure for a soli-
tary phenomenon called Cancer (add-
ing, of course, that science is coming 
close); indeed, Bertino agrees it isn't 
unusual for a specialist in some other 
field to think that cancer is more 
hopeless than, say, kidney trans-
plants. 


"People think of cancer as being 
a disease and that a cure will drop 
out of the sky," says Bertino. 
"What's happening is that we're 
curing more and more cancer every 
year. Four or five disseminated (past 
local stage) cancers, most of them 
the rapidly growing types, are cured 
by drugs a percentage of the time: 
Hodgkin's disease, acute leukemia in 
children, Choriocarcinoma (cancer of 
the placenta), Burkitt's lymphoma 
(in African children), Wilms' tumor 
(childhood kidney cancer).

"I think we've got one of the best 
programs in the country for treat-
ing disseminated Hodgkin's. We use 
a combination of drugs (chemother-
apy) and follow that by a low dose of 
radiation therapy to all known areas 
of the disease. Eighty per cent of 
our disseminated Hodgkin's patients 
are in complete remission now, that 
is, the outlook is for cure. 


"We have ten or so patients who 
are more than two years since begin-
ning the treatment and are now off 
all therapy. They come in every three 
to six months just for a checkup." 


On the other hand, Bertino 
asserts, "We're not doing well in 
lung and colon cancers. Pancreas and 
stomach cancers are very bad. Liver 
cancer is unusual but many cancers 
will spread to the liver, in which 
case they're very difficult to manage. 
Although at present we cannot cure 
breast cancer with chemotherapy, 
there's the hope that this might be 
the next major solid tumor we can do 
something with significantly in 
chemotherapy.'' 


On the subject of common sim-
plification, another section member, 
Dr. Malcolm Mitchell added, "What 
we're doing now with our incoming 
general residents and interns is incul-
cating the positive attitude that 
'cancer' isn't a bad word. It's just 
another disease, often chronic, some-
times curable. The cancer patient can 
be very much like a patient with 
chronic kidney disease, chronic dia-
betes, or chronic anything, who we 
follow up for a longer period of time, 
making his disease better." For him 
the patients are far from resembling 
hopeless gargoyles: "We often 
remind students the patients aren't 
uniformly dead and dying.'' 


Ironically, it is the cancer patient 
who often threatens a physician, 
Mitchell says. "It isn't so much the 
problem of how to deal with a cancer 
patient but the cancer patient 
himself, just having a patient with 
cancer. A failure. You know you're 
not going to cure him, at least you 
think not. 


"Some physicians consistently 
don't tell their patients the truth. 
They'll say they have a benign tumor 
but it's going to be cured. These are 
false impressions any way you look 
at it and we have the odious but 
necessary task of telling a patient 
that he has a tumor present in such 
and such a location. Of course he's 
scared but he'd rather have specifics 
than distort things out of proportion. 
I won't say it's growing wildly wher-
ever it is but I'll say it's present ex-
actly where it is. I'll also give an ele-
ment of hope. I'll never say precisely 
'you've got a year or six months to 
live' because I'm working against 
myself by giving the patient a time. 


"Sometimes patients are told that 
they have severe anemia like an 18 
year-old girl I know. She wasn't 
being told she had a very rapidly 
growing ovarian tumor. 'Is it malig-
nant?' she asked. I said, 'Well, 
malignant to you may mean it's all 
over the body. It's not all over. You 
have it in your abdomen and liver.' 
When you talk about a malignant 
tumor to somebody you don't know 
what visions he has conjured up: it's 
all over the place, it's eating him 
up. 


In another recent case, Mitchell 
met with a cancer patient whose wife 
told Mitchell in private, "I don't 
want you to tell him all about his 
cancer. I'm not sure he can handle 
it!" So Mitchell asked, "Why do you 
think that? He seems very reason-
able. Can you handle it?" It became 
obvious she wanted to tell her hus-
band but didn't feel able to because 
her doctor thought it was a bad 
idea. "It's been killing me to have to 
hold this inside myself,'' she said. 


According to Mitchell, "The fam-
ily member or doctor thinks he's 
sparing the patient but he's always 
sparing himself. When I finally told 
the woman how I was going to tell 
her husband what he's got she said, 
'Oh thank heavens, now we can talk 
about it, the two of us.' " 


Fortunately, these encounters 
aren't routine, although they happen 
more often than the oncologists like. 
While community physicians some-
times do offer their patients either 
unfair despair or unrealistic hope, 
Bertino notes that it works both 
ways. "Some outside physicians are 
very interested, will talk with us 
about what we're going to do, and 
will help the patient evaluate 
whether it's worthwhile taking the 
drug or entering the trial. Others 
refer their patients and then have 
really no more communication with 
them. It's just up to us to talk to the 
patient." 


As a discipline, oncology doesn't 
imply any one specific therapy. 
Chemotherapy is one mode but 
oncologists also use surgery, radio· 
therapy and the newer immuno-
therapy. Immunotherapy essentially 
involves using the host's own 
immunity to help him defeat the 
tumor by stimulating this immunity, 
or giving him immunity from 
another host who has better 
immunity. 


About ten years ago the oncology 
section was created by the depart-
ments of Pharmacology and Medi-
cine under the rather in~pirational 
leadership of Dr. Arnold Welch and 
Dr. Paul Beeson, who understood 
better than most that the use of 
drugs in man should mean a very 
strong input from pharmacology and 
basic science. No longer a fledgling, 
the section now has six faculty, five 
postdoctoral fellows, two research 
nurses and a physician's assistant. 


At least twenty faculty are involved 
more tangentially. 


"The quality of our postdoctoral 
fellows has been remarkable the last 
couple of years," says Bertino. 
"When this was a new discipline in 
medicine and many schools had no 
medical oncology sections, all the 
excitement was in metabolism and 
infectious disease. Cancer treatment 
was considered kind of low down. It 
was a very investigational kind of 
program. There weren't that many

effective drugs. Sporadically, good 
people with genuine scientific 
interest were applying, but in recent 
years -well, the chief residents are 
wanting to go into our program." 


Bertino looks to the future. "In 
our proposed new cancer center, we 
hope to have a cluster of people 
working together in virology, 
looking at it from different vantages: 
we expect to have a genetic virolo-
gist, a so-called biologic virologist, a 
phenomena virologist (who examines 
what happens when a virus infects 
the cell) and a structural virologist." 


Like other medical centers, Yale 
has chemotherapy clinical trials 
called Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. 
The first phase, where the problem is 
toxicity, is to see whether the drug 
can be used at all and to establish 
the dosage range. At one time the 
drug amount was expressed in terms 
of the body weight for each species; 
it's now more often expressed in 
terms of body surface area, so 
one can calculate dosage from one 
species to another more easily. 


Once the dosage range is estab-
lished, the investigators go on to find 
out how effective the drug really is 
against a certain disease. Thus 
Phase 2. There are Yale-instigated 
trials and national group trials in 
which Yale participates. Yale can 
either participate in a national trial 
routinely (the mere injection of an 
agent in a determined number of sub-
jects) or choose to "extend" the 
national group trial by further 
research and development. A 20-
member committee of the National 
Cancer Institute acts to encourage 
more collaboration in the extensive 
and high-priority clinical trial of 
compounds. It looks at the results 
obtained, looks at the protocols 
(studies with well-defined proce-
dures) drawn up for treatment, 
makes criticisms and may recom-
mend Federal money for the 
research. 


Along with the surgeons, radio-
therapists and a statistician who sit 
on this particular review committee 
is Yale's Dr. William Creasy. Creasy 
is a biochemical pharmacologist who 
studies plant substances that may 
chemically inhibit cell division. His 
area of expertise is the mechanism of 
action of anti-cancer drugs at the 
cellular level. 


Creasy is almost a Prospero 
figure, a benign presence in his labo-
ratory island of ferns. He even 
worked with periwinkles once, those 
border flowers that don't just crop 
up in Jane Austen flower beds, but in 
chemistry labs as well. About 12 
years ago an extract of common peri-
winkle developed in Canada ("at 
least a foreign variety of this which 
has larger amounts of drug") was 
introduced in the Yale clinic for 
Volume seven, number two I November 25,1973 I 12 
toxicology studies. This extract Vin-
blastine, was found useful in treating 
lymphomas (cancer of the lymph 
system). "In fact Vinblastine is one 
of the most useful agents that's 
available. That and Vincristine 
which occurs in the same plant. 
When I came nothing was known of 
their pharmacology or biochem-
istry," Creasey says. 


Many people may start at a third of 
that dose. You may do two patients 
at that level. If you see nothing you 
go to another level, maybe twice the 
first one.'' 


Toxicity is also very much on 
Mitchell's mind. Creasey spoke of 
leukemia studies; Mitchell, besides 
supervising the bone marrow trans-
plantation program, is extending the

Research in the lab now involves 
three different plant drugs isolated 
elsewhere. It appears, however, that 
the "Mexican Tree Fern"(a smaller 
version of the 15-20 root plants 
growing like trees in the Vera Cruz 
region of Mexico) has the best "ser-
endipity quotient" for Creasey. 


"While I was looking for something 
else in a very old issue of Nature, 20 
or 30 years old, I found this article 
where someone had found anti-
biotic activities in some crude 
extracts of this material." 


"Creasey works on this problem in 
a room of his laboratory where he 
maintains several transplanted 
mouse tumors, on which he tests 
combinations of old as well as pos-
sible new toxic agents. "We haven't 
got the pure compound yet," he 
says. Progress in working up the ex-
tract is slow because the compound 
is highly water-soluble, but soon 
some chemists may help out in an 
effort of larger scale. 


Creasey gave one striking ex-
ample of a Phase I study running 
into an unexpected toxicity problem. 


"Some years ago we had a very big 
input developing a drug called 
Azauridine which was tried as an 
anti-leukemia agent (since that time 
used for psoriasis and other things). 
You can give a rat a good dose of 
this stuff; it appears to have no 
effect. But a dog can die if given just 
one-hundreth of that dose. How do 
you know how a human body is 
going to react in such situations? 


"Most of the other species didn't 
show nearly as much sensitivity as 
the dog. The mouse was a little more 
sensitive than the rat. As it turned 
out, humans--like rats--could tolerate 
very large doses. 


"But we didn't start at large 
doses. We started assuming that 
man was like the dog rather than the 
rat. Usually we start in the human 
with a dose considerably lower than 
the lowest dose that's been shown to 
produce toxicity in any species. 


national trial of the B.C.G. vaccine 
(a tuberculin bacillus) to discover 
what effect it has on immunologic 
function in leukemia patients and 
those with malignant melanoma (a 
dark-pigmented tumor). "There's no 
evidence that B.C.G. is a cure for 
human cancer in spite of some notor-
iety about it elsewhere last year. It's 
becoming acceptable therapy, but 
it's not standard therapy that any 
physician in the community can do. 
We do this under very strict scien-
tific control. I follow the immunity of 
all these patients in the lab by doing 
tests on the lymphocytes (corpuscles 
formed in lymph glands) to see 
whether or not they're boosting their 
immunity with B.C.G. Potentially, 
each of the patients with tumors has 
immunity to that tumor." 


Mitchell points out that animal 
systems provide an analogy to hu-
man systems that is useful in his re-
search. "Most of the animal models 
have been leukemia models because 
they're easy to work with. You need 
fewer than 100,000 cells (usually 
fewer than 10,000) to get really sig-
nificant results even in mice in im-
munotherapy research. It was natur-
al to apply the agent B.C.G. to hu-
man leukemia since the analogy was 
already there from the animal 
system." 


Bertino also chose leukemia pa-
tients for his 1972 trial of the enzyme 
carboxypeptidase Gl(CPG1)."I'm 
not so sure we've chosen the right 
kind of cancer patient to test," he 
maintains, "But when you have a 
limited amount of the drug and you 
want to demonstrate its effective-
ness and also be able to measure its 
effects on cells, then leukemia offers 
you the opportunity much better 
than other kinds of human cancer. 
Leukemia patients have the tumor 
cells in the blood so you can sample 
them to see whether the blood count 
is going up or down. If the blood 
count goes down by 50 percent or 25 
percent you can measure that accu-
rately. With solid tumors you get 
some changes that may not be 
related to drug effect." 


CPGl depletes the body's folic 
acid compounds necessary to cell 
growth, as did the enzyme methotex-
rate on which Bertino and his col-
leagues did some pioneering work for 
ten years. With a very limited supply 
of CPG 1 and with the knowledge 
that children have tested more re-
sponsively to chemical agents in the 
past than adults, Bertino's first 
group included three children and 
one woman. He sees a possibility of 
eventually using dialysis with CPG 1 
in a one or two-week program to get 
some kind of remission. If periodic 
treatment should be needed, it would 
not be the type of continuous life-
support dialysis program needed for 
patients without kidney function. 


Bertino and his colleagues hope to 
proceed to a direct strategy where 
the enzyme would be inserted 
through tubes into the patient's 
bloodstream. 


In all medical research, the ethical 
problem of coercion arises, often in 
the form of psychological arm-twist-
ing which pressures a sick person 
into trying experimental therapy. 
This problem is not foreign to 
these physician-investigators. 


Having served for five years on the 
Human Investigation Committee 
(HIC) of the School of Medicine and 
Yale-New Haven Hospital, Mitchell 
emphasizes that much strenuous 
thinking remains to be done in areas 
pertaining to experimental work 
with human subjects. Protocols, 
questionnaires and invasion of 
privacy must all be investigated. 


How do physicians get around the 
coercion problem when a patient is 
presented with a choice of therapy 
procedures without adequately 
understanding them? Here, the In-
formed Consent form is vital. The 
"Consent Form for Participation in a 
Clinical Investigation Project" con-
cludes, "Its (the project's) general 
purposes, potential benefits, and 
possible hazards and inconveniences 
have been explained to my satisfac-
tion." The procedure must be ex-
plained to him in non-technical lan-
guage, and the patient has to know 
he'll get standard therapy should he 
choose not to participate in the 
study. Not only the subject but also 
his responsible next of kin must sign 
the consent form. 


Yale's guidelines on the protec-
tion of human subjects were drafted 
in accordance with the guidelines 
issued by the Department of Health, 
Education and Welfare to all medical 
centers. These local guidelines stipu-
late that all completed protocols and 
consent forms become part of the 
permanent record of the committee's
