proceedings and are "subject to in-
spection and review by various 
granting agencies." HIC annually 
reviews any ongoing grant proposals 
involving investigations of human 
subjects. Furthermore, the prin-
cipal investigator has the responsi-
bility of submitting a revised proto-
col whenever the nature of his proj-
ect changes in a way that might 
affect participating subjects. 

The oncologists try to detail to 
the patient everything that might 
happen in the way of side effects, 
while emphasizing that none of these 
w may happen at all. A patient's accep-
tance may depend a great deal on 
his confidence in the doctor. The on-
cology section, therefore, is quite 
aware of what might be called per-
sonality coercion, or undue defer· 
ence to the Man in the White Coat. 

" We're aware that the patient 
might feel, 'If I don't do this the doc-
tor won't like me anymore','' says 
Mitchell. "I'm not sure we ever total-
ly get around coercion but I think we 
make strides in that direction. We'd 
never give a patient an investiga-
tional agent if we had something 
that would work reasonably well. If 
we knew a drug worked 30 or 40 per-
cent of the time, even for a short 
period of time, we'd use that agent in 
preference to our newer agent. 

"The only situation in which we'd 
probably use a very strong new 
agent on a patient who is ambula-
. tory and functioning well would be 
when we know the disease would 
make him bedridden very soon. We'd 
have to believe that there would be 
a therapeutic gain.'' 

Supposing a lot of staff time and 
money has been invested in a certain 
Phase 1 trial and the seventh patient 
out of seven has had his endurance 
stretched to the limit and wants out . 
If he's intimidated by the doctor's 
aura of authority he may not broach 
his true feeling, and may not ask to 
withdraw as the Informed Consent 
form says he can. What then? 

" It depends on what kind of ther-
apeutic effects you're getting," Ber-
tino says. " If the patient is pretty 
sick and he vomits and the next day 
the blood count is improving, both 
patient and doctor feel a lot more 
. 
enthusiastic about continuing than 1f 
nothing much is happening. The 
problem you get into is having those 
bad effects with the patient not feel-
ing better or the disease not getting 
better. 

" If you get one of our unit physi-
cians who's very much interested in 
the drug. it's perhaps easy for him to 
rationalize and continue pushing 
when it's not, maybe, in the patient's 
best interest. But we criticize our-
selves. If a doctor persists in using a 
drug, getting some effects he 
shouldn't get. he gets noise back 
from the others. The patient isn't 
sequestered away and surreptitously 
fed something." 

"Sometimes there's a problem we 
run into if a drug we test is of no 
value in six or seven patients consec-
utively-itdoes give them some side 
effects-yet you need a last few 
patients in order to make sure you 
aren't missing something. That's 
hard to do. That's the problem some-
times." 

Bertino emphasized that being 
both physician and investigator is a 
hard balancing act: "Our field is apt 
to attract very scientific kinds of 
people, but I think in this area more 
than any you really have to be able 
to deal with people and patients and 
to understand yourself because it can 
get very difficult dealing with dying 
patients. We have a lot of patient-
family interaction." And the full pro-
fessors join in, not holding them-
selves aloof by using nurses as inter-
mediaries to meet families and brief 
patients. 

" We have a great floor, " Bertino 
says."We're fortunate we're not 
overloaded with patients per faculty 
member. We give the patients a lot 
of support (they need it). Our two 
special procedures nurses in Out-· 
patient are just tremendous. The 
morale is amazingly good." 

"The mythology is that we give 
drugs to people, " Dr. Mitchell con-
cluded."We don't. When you treat a 
patient you're in close collaboration 
with him. You get phone calls at 1 
am. the way a practicing physician 
does. I 've come in here at all hours of 
the day and night to take care of 
people. Clinical research really 
means three kinds of things : taking 
care of patients, teaching, and doing 
research on the patients and in the 
lab. Research here can't be non-
people oriented. It doesn't protect 
you from the buffeting of patient 
contact at all. 

"What it does is give you a differ-
ent relationship to the patient. You 
are both his physician and his inves-
tigator, a very difficult thing to 
bring off. You have ethical conside-
rations in mind while you also treat 
him investigatively. The two aren't 
at all contradictory. The best 
physician really does investigate and 
learns from the patient so he treats 
him better and the next one even 
better." 

His feeling rose: " If you restrict 
your research to mice and test tubes 
then you can avoid patients if you 
wish. But most of us would be very 
reluctant to go into a pure lab envi-
ronment. We also feel we need the 
stimulation of research to feel we're 
really doing the most for our 
patients. The basic myth that people 
who don't like patients can go into 
academic medicine b false. This is 
clinical practice plus.''O
