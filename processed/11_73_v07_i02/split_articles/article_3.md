"Where are my words?" 
6:10 on a Wednesday evening, 20 
minutes before ten million house· 
holds will tune in the NBC Nightly 
News, finds anchorman John Chan-
cellor at NBC's Manhattan head· 
quarters puffing his pipe and watch-
ing his shoes get shined. He is not 
waiting to begin his work-on the 
contrary. he has nearly completed a 
workday that began at nine in the 
morning. He has written and broad-
cast his daily "Monitor" radio essay, 
collected the wire-service copy and 
written most of the script for to-
night's show. After his half-hour 
newscast he will be heading home. 

At 6:20 Chancellor rolls down the 
sleeves of his red pin-striped shirt, 
straightens his tie and reaches for his 
jacket. He strides through the news· 
room to his secretary's desk, looking 
for his script. "Where are my 
words?" He finds the sheaf of yellow 
and white carbons-yellow for his 
words, white for technical cues-and 
heads down a long hallway toward 
the studio. 

His script will not be complete 
until several minutes into the broad-
cast, for the newsroom staff is still 
working to complete the final edit-
ing, time the length of news items, 
and determine the final order of to-
night's show. In the control room 
a director and producer are verifying 
that videotapes are ready to roll, 
commercials cued up, art work for 
the VIZ screens behind Chancellor 
properly ordered, and the announcer 
ready. But Chancellor, in the studio, 
appears to be in no hurry. He pencils 
in his final notes and corrections on 
his carbons, checks out the Tele-
Prompter which feeds him the orig-
inal, clears his throat, and at pre-
cisely 6:30 smoothly delivers the 
news. 

After 23 years in the news bus-
iness John Chancellor is a steady 
professional, well accustomed to the 
pressures of time, expert at last min-
ute changes. He is relatively new at 
the anchorman position, however. 
He succeeded the famed Huntley-
Brinkley team in August of 1971 
after Chet Huntley retired. Although 
Brinkley remains on the Nightly 
News intoning commentaries Tues-
day through Saturday, Chancellor 
has imparted to the NBC Nightly 
News a tone of professional so-
briety unlike the informal, often 
caustic delivery of his predecessors. 

In the Nielson ratings, Chancellor 
is the man in the middle, sandwiched 
between front-running Walter Cron-
kite of CBS and the Smith-Reasoner 
team at ABC. "We've been tailgat-
ing Cronkite for over a year now," he 
comments, "and I hope to catch him." 

Some critics feel that Chancellor's 
straightforward and often formal 
newscasting style p resents an ob-
stacle to catching Cronkite. "I'm 
accused of being much too dure and 
professorial," he admits, yet he 
claims that most of the news these 
days requires serious treatment. 

Besides, he is a reporter, not a per-
former. "I think the news is im-
portant," he says. ''I'm just the 
channel for it." 

The Nightly Neu•s staff approves 
of Chancellor's choice of style and 
believes that in time it will prove 
effective in attracting viewers. Chan-
cellor has only been the solo anchor-
man for a little over a year. "It takes 
a long time to build trust and con-
fidence ... he says. "We're trying to 
build that way, and in a few years I 
hope it will work, that we will have 
the biggest audience. But the second 
biggest audience isn't bad." 

If Chancellor's on-the-air demean-
or gives the impression that he 
knows what he is talking about, it is 
because he writes much of the news 
he reads. He is the chief writer for 
the program. "Most of the important 
work has been done by the time I get 
into the studio," he says. "Assem-
bling the news, deciding on it, writ-
ing it and reporting it interest me 
more than performing it on the air." 

Chancellor's dedication to the 
news has developed over the years 
since he took his first job with a 
newspaper. Born in Chicago in 1927, 
he left DePaul Academy at the age of 
15 to work at odd jobs until the 
outbreak of World War II, when he 
enlisted in the Army as a public re-
lations specialist. After his discharge 
and a brief stay at the University of 
Illinois, he started work as a copy-
boy for the Chicago Sun-Times. He 
rose quickly-through the ranks, and 
by 1949 had become a feature writer 
with a beat extending across the 
U.S. and Canada. It wasn't long be-
fore his work attracted the attention 
of the NBC-affiliated TV station in 
Chicago, WNBQ. 

Chancellor joined WNBQ in 1950 
and quickly established a reputation 
for intrepid reporting. He responded 
to police radio calls in an unmarked 
car equipped with a flashing red 
light and a siren, and could thus 
beat most other reporters to the 
scene of a news event. In 1955, he lay 
face down on the street in the midst 
of a Chicago gun battle to tape-re-
cord the capture of a murderer. For 
this effort he won the Sigma Delta 
Chi award for outstanding reporting. 

By 1956, his reporting skill was 
landing him NBC assignments of na-
tional importance. He covered the 
p residential campaign that year, in-
cluding the Chicago and San Fran-
cisco conventions. NBC sent him to 
Little Rock, Arkansas, to cover the 
openin g of a newly-desegregated 
high school. H e ended up staying for 
eight weeks when racial violence 
erupted t here.
