An Interview with Proctor and Bergman 

Philip Proctor and Peter Bergman 
have marketed craziness-successfully-for 
the last seven years. 
Graduates ('62 and '61) from a Yale 
that required jackets and ties in class 
and at dinner, the two nevertheless 
created two-fourths of a comedy 
phenomenon known as Firesign 
Theater. Firesign Theater (all four of 
them have astrological fire signs) 
was born in the counter culture of the 
LBJ years, beginning as Radio Free 
Oz, on a Los Angeles radio station 
where they would "show movies" 
over the radio, very much in the tradition 
of the "Lone Ranger" and 
the "Green Hornet" radio shows. 

Firesign soon became distinctive for 
a peculiar multi-level humor with 
cinematic qualities, trafficking in 
discontinuity and free association. 
Their style is systematic madness-it 
takes off from the mundane 
and delivers the listener to the nether 
regions of pure fantasy with ever-
present plays on language and 
sound: situational humor, like a 
high school principal addressing the 
student body, a new car with environmental 
options, or a futuristic 
pay television station where distinctions 
between video and libidinal impulses 
crumble. 

Firesign albums-their first five 
collectively have sold a million 
copies-have not played to counter 
culture audiences as much as they 
have helped shape that counter culture-a 
contention suggested by 
daily language, where there are as 
many expressions that originated 
with the Theater as there are from, 
say, a Shakespeare play. Which 
makes sense, since two of Firesign 
were once Shakespearean actors-
Bergman was not, but he did invent 
the phrase "love-in": "I was 
working for a listener-sponsored 
radio station where nobody gets 
paid. So I decided to sell something 
over the radio and I invented 
the 'love-in kit'. That's also where 
the word 'kit' originated." 

Proctor and Bergman came to 
Yale November 9 after shooting their 
first movie short in three days. Their 
concert at Sprague Hall resumed a 
nationwide promotion tour of their 
first non-firesign album, TV OR 
NOT TV, before a riotous, dopedrenched 
audience. They had played 
Yale before (as Firesign at Woolsey 
Hall) in the late sixties when their 
appeal was greatest. "The stage was 
so high," says Proctor, "I thought 
we were going to be guillotined." 

Those days are gone. Though they 
are touring separately, they insist 
that the group hasn't split up, but 
that they all just needed a rest from 
each other. The other two members 
of the group, Phil Austin and David 
Ossman, don't like to tour as much, 
and, after all, Proctor and Bergman 
did go to Yale together. 

The Yale half of Firesign is a 
likely pair; they met, so the releases 
go, under the stage of the Yale 
Dramat in 1959. Although they were 
merely "professional acquaintances" 
then, their years at Yale created a 
bond between them. Proctor was a 
Pundit and a Scroll and Key man, 
Bergman a former managing editor 
of the Yale Record. 

They have been anxious to 
develop a new format for a visual 
show, and their effort was evident 
during their performance at Yale. 
The largely audial-centered Firesign 
touch that made them famous was 
missing. On stage, Proctor, in a pink 
frilled shirt, mugged it for sight 
gags; Bergman, with a maniacal grin, 
punned relentlessly. In the midst of 
experimentation, they tried new 
stuff, reworking material off their 
TV OR NOT TV album into a tight 
visual show. The audience, anxious 
to see it work, responded enthusiastically 
at first, heckling with lines off 
old Firesign albums, dressed up as 
the "Bozo" and "Bosco" heroes of 
some earlier theater fantasies. They 
were patient with the show's weak 
transitions, thrilled with the visual 
puns that corresponded to the verbal 
ones, hissed anti-feminist material, 
and cheered suggestions of old Fire-
sign flashes. The show was only a 
moderate success. Proctor and 
Bergman alone aren't Firesign, nor 
did they try to be. 

They have grown with their 
public. Gone are the great counter 
culture audiences; submerged, perhaps, 
in the greater slick commercialism 
that has infested all spectacles in the 
media today. 

Knowing that they have to keep 
moving with the times, Proctor and 
Bergman are show biz pros now, not 
freaky kids. They have families, 
agents, contract negotiations. One of 
them lives in Beverly Hills. They're 
talking about doing a TV series next 
season, about guest appearances on 
the Helen Reddy Show ("she's so 
nice," says Bergman, with a wave of 
his hand one only sees in the thick of 
Hollywood). They refuse to put down 
Cheech and Chong: "Great guys." 

Along with this commercial maturity, 
one notices a desire for reflection, 
self-evaluation and nostalgia 
for their days at Yale-the days 
when one of their friends appeared as 
Jesus during the freshman riots; 
when Bergman pulled pranks on 
senior society tap night by chaining 
the entrances to the colleges ("Did I 
really do that?"); when Proctor, who 
was working as a bursary student for 
Yale Reports, spliced together one 
great report featuring the coughs, 
throat clearings, gutterals, and 
sneezes of celebrities who came to 
Yale. 

There have been traces of Yale in 
the Firesign albums through the 
years as well. Nick Danger (from 
"How Can You Be in Two Places at 
Once When You're Not Anywhere at 
All") has an "old campus sweetheart". 
In TV OR NOT TV, one routine invokes 
secret Scroll and Key 
terminology that nobody else would 
understand. But beyond these instances 
lies the claim that Yale had a
