On the campaign trail with Oedipus Rep 
by Michael Jacobson. 
John Mitchell would not like 
Watergate Classics (or, The Bug 
Stops Here). 
Not because he would feel that 
Yale Repertory Theatre Director 
Robert Brustein is assaulting a pub· 
lie long ago wearied by Johnny Car· 
son's Watergate monologues. Not 
simply because he would resent be· 
ing cast as the Tinman in Ouer the 
Rainbow. The once-Attorney Gen· 
eral would object that Brustein and 
his fellow playwrights are attribut· 
ing too much significance to the W a· 
tergate Affair. After all, comparing 
Nixon's problems to those of Oedi· 
pus Rex? Is that fair to either of 
them? 


Mitchell's knocks notwithstanding, 
the Rep's approach to "Classics" 
penetrates beyond topical humor. 
The revue's creators explore on stage 
the parallels between the Watergate 
fiasco- a contemporary tragedy-
and episodes from classic drama by 
Shakespeare, Sophocles and Beckett. 
Brustein and his Rep colleagues hope 
that the presumably non-partisan 
classic dramatists will help them to 
plumb the moral depths of the Wa-
tergate Affair. 


The idea to produce a Watergate 
revue based on the classics first oc-
curred to Brustein last year during a 
leave spent traveling in Greece, re-
tracing Oedipus' journey to Delphi. 
The news of the implication of Halde-
man and Ehrlichman had just bro· 
ken, drawing Nixon into the Wa-
tergate investigation, and Brustein was 
struck by the parallel between Nixon 
and Oedipus. He set down his ideas 
in an article called "Nixon on the 
road to Delphi," and later gave them 
dramatic form in a play called Oedi-
pus Nix. 


Back in the States, Brustein sug-
gested the revue idea to Rep mem· 
bers Jonathan Marks and Jeremy 
Geidt, who co-produced a Watergate 
spoof at the Yale Cabaret last spring. 
Marks and Geidt enthusiastically set 
about writing Sam Ervin into 
Shakespeare, resulting in a playlet 
called "Samlet." By fall, the revue 
had grown to include contributions 
by Lonnie Carter, Art Buchwald and 
Jules Feiffer. 


To direct the production, Brustein 
called on Isaiah Sheffer, a man with 
numerous film, television and stage 
productions to his credit. Sheffer 
agreed readily. "I was interested in 
this play because of the central 
idea," he explains. "It was not just 
to have a Watergate cabaret, but to 
use certain classics, which we have 
all grown up with, to make some 
sense out of what is happening." 


While to some using the classics 
to show what is universal about 
Watergate may seem to echo the 
Republican protest "But everyone 
does it!", "Classics" does not apolo-
gize for Nixon. Rather, it seeks to 
put the Watergate tragedy in the 
dramatic context of Sophocles or 
Beckett to give larger meaning to the 
acts of "a few overzealous men." 


The classics provide an appropriate 
vehicle for this task precisely 
because they address questions 
which have persistently plagued 
mankind. Brustein's "Oedipus Nix", 
for example, draws from the Sopho-
clean play whose central character 
lacks the insight to realize that he is 
the source of corruption in his own 
kingdom. 


Obviously, the entertainment 
value of the production profits from 
popular familiarity with the classics 
(and with the cast of Watergate 
heros and villians as well). Yet it is 
debatable whether the classics them-
selves are in any way enhanced by 
their topical interpretations. The 
creators of "Classics" are quick to 
point out, however, that it is not 
their purpose to "blaspheme" the 
plays from which they have drawn. 


As Geidt puts it, "How can you 
blaspheme the classics? They have 
been plumbed for new material ever 
since they've become classics." 


"We are not trying to screw up 
the classics but to make political use 
out of them," adds Sheffer. Many of 
the plays from which the Rep has 
drawn are in themselves deeply 
political: Oedipus Rex, Agamemnon, 
Hamlet. In each case, the creators 
have tried to remain true to the spirit 
of the original version. "Samlet", says 
Marks, is actually a validation of 
Hamlet's classical thought. "It's 
probably the type of thing Shake-
speare had in mind all along," he 
comments. "He just didn't get the 
newspapers." 


Perhaps Shakespeare was lucky 
that he didn't. For every form of 
political satire must deal with the 
problem of topicality: it must keep 
up with, and in some cases stay a 
jump ahead of, political events. 


With Watergate, that problem is 
particularly acute. Since the initial 
disclosures, events have occurred so 
rapidly that it is difficult to keep 
abreast of the latest developments, 
much less ponder their meaning or 
joke about them. "Watergate Clas· 
sics" was conceived during the sum-
mer, written this fall, and will run 
from November 16 through January. 


With all that has happened in the 
past three months alone, an un-
