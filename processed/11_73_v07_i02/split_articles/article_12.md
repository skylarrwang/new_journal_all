cert Manager Vincent Oneppo called 
Zamfir "the world's greatest living 
virtuoso" on the pan-pipe. While in 
the U.S. such brilliance is given the 
same adulation as is washboard· 
playing, pan-pipe playing is hailed in 
Rumania, where it is taught in con-
servatories, and where ~amfir ' s per· 
formances have made him a national 
hero. Swiss critic Renee Cervan 
called Zamfir, who is famous 
throughout Europe,"an unequaled 
virtuoso, a sensous poet, positively 
miraculous." 

The other series are the Yale 
Piano ~eries and 'Great Quartets of 
theW orld ·. The latter appeals to 
what ·program co-ordinator Roger 
Hall calls "a ready-made string· 
quartet audience." He adds, "uni· 
versity areas such as Yale are more 
prone to go for such intellectual, and 
in a way snobbish, tastes." Hall 
boasts "I think it would be difficult 
to put together a stronger series. We 
have included the Guarneri, Julliard, 
and Amadeus quartets, which are 
among the finest around today." The 
series was sold out in September . 

. The Sprague Hall series com· 
plement the Woolsey Hall concerts 
(which feature big-name soloists) 
and the Music School Sanford Lee· 
tures and Ellington Series (which 
presents great Afro-American 
musicians). Though the music pro· 
gram is compartmentalized, the 
overall structure of music offerings 
is an integrated whole. Rather than 
presenting diversity within each 
series. as they did last year, the 
M ~;~sic School provides balance 
among the series. 

Perhaps most important, the Uni· 
versity is seen. as the party bringing 
culture to New Haven.
