Yale in Jail 
Do thirty-one people voluntarily 
locked into a contrived situation 
experience the real situation? And 
can they validly transfer the 
thoughts they formulate in the simu-
lated experience into learning about 
a "real life" situation? 

Twenty-one Yale students and ten 
Boston State College students expe-
rienced prison directly but hypothet-
ically six weeks ago when they spent 
a weekend as "inmates" in the 
former Haddam County Jail. Now 
the Connecticut Department of Cor-
rections Criminal Justice Training 
Academy, the jail helps state correc-
tion officers and prison personnel 
understand prisoner behavior by 
exposing the law-abiding to the 
incarceration normally reserved for 
the law-breaking. 

Seventeen of the Yalies were 
members of the Calhoun/Branford 
seminar ''Incarceration: Conse-
quences and Alternatives." The sem-
inar is taught jointly by Roy King, 
a Visiting Ford Foundation Research 
Fellow in the sociology department 
and Sociology Professor at Eng-
land's University of Southampton, 
and Kelsey Kaufman, Yale '71, 
former corrections officer and now a 
Harvard graduate student. 

The seminar's multiform 
approach to learning distinguishes it 
from most Yale courses. The stu-
dents try to understand incarcera-
tion not only through the conven-
tional media of readings and a 
research paper, but also through 
field trips, movies, and encounters 
with guest speakers( among them 
corrections administrators and past 
and present inmates). The lock-up, 
which no one knew about when they 
signed up for the seminar, was 
intended to provide a radical base to 
the whole course. 

In some respects, the incarc~a­
tion was a phony situation. Being 
allowed to spend a weekend in jail is 
· not the same as having a long stretch 
of "time" ahead-everyone knew 
they would leave on Sunday. But 
once the student inmates entered the 
sealed world of the prison the situa-
tion quickly became • 'real'' enough. 
They were searched thoroughly, 
deprived of all personal belongings, 
clad in prison uniforms, assigned 
numbers instead of names, and 
locked peremptorily into separate 
cells. They were allowed no books, no 
watches, no pencil or paper. The only 
faces they could see were those of the 
professionally hostile guards. 

Real boredom and frustration set 
in-the experience was taking hold. 
The guards were "out to get" every-
body, and kept changing the "rules 
of the game" with studied but 
impenetrable arbitrariness. Solidar-
ity between the inmates grew 
quickly, beginning as a familiarity 
with the others' voices, and culmina-
ting in the great toilet paper inci-
dent of Saturday night. 

That night the guards made the 
fatal, if human, blunder of becoming 
so absorbed in "All in the Family" 
that they neglected to conduct their 
rounds. Suddenly freed from scru-
tiny, the inmates on the men's cell 
block (two tiers of ten cells each) 
began to construct a monument to 
solidarity and defiance. Slowly and 
laboriously they wove a thread of 
toilet paper through the bars and 
passed it from cell to cell. ("Don't 
laugh!" protested one of the partici-
pants, "don't you realize how serious 
this was, and how fragile toilet paper 
is?") The prisoners connected 18 
cells before they were discovered. 

The "former inmates•· grinned 
when they recounted that episode, 
but hastened to add that it was an 
exceptional interlude, a rare moment 
of victory over the guards. The rest 
of the weekend was hardly as glam-
orously high-pitched. It consisted 
above all of boredom and the queasy 
disorientation of not knowing what 
time it was or how much remained. 
They were humiliated by being 
treated as a numbered quantity, 
frustrated by confinement. As one 
student summarized ·'The externals 
of it may have been contrived, but 
the internals certainly were real. .. 

To what extent can one bring an 
experience like that weekend back 
into the classroom? Most of t he stu-
dents noted that there had been little 
explicit mention of the common 
experience after it occurred; it was 
never discussed in class. Still, the 
experience, however unarticulated, 
remains a kind of undercurrent of 
understanding. Everyone agrees 
that the course would have been 
qualitatively different without the 
prison weekend. One person spoke of 
a "silent knowing" which all share 
intuitively-a rare form of knowl-
edge at Yale nowadays. 

A couple of years ago, there were 
many more courses at Yale similar to 
this seminar in attitude, courses 
which tried to combine qualitatively 
different layers of learning into a 
variegated understanding, which 
tried to balance the inevitable pas-
sivity of books-and-lecture learning 
with direct experiential involvement. 
Many of these courses were report-
edly quashed because faculty and 
administrators felt that they lacked 
·intellectual rigor. Or, perhaps they 
disappeared because the legendary 
student shift toward serious bookish-
ness really has occurred. Still, the 
success of this seminar makes a 
strong case for the educational value 
of courses which are not only intellec-
tually rigorous, but also emotionally 
and personally demanding.

Pan-pipes and Pianos 
The Yale Music School broke with 
tradition last year by sponsoring two 
"variety series" rather than a 
variety of series. 

Last year's series, descriptively 
titled Series A and Series B, 
presented outside performers and 
Music School faculty, respectively. 
The School soon discovered that the 
variety which appealed to everyone 
in general prompted no one in partic-
ular to buy season tickets. Hence 
they revived the old approach: two 
of three series this year will have 
quite focused appeal. The Con-
noisseur Series will present artists 
from different areas of music. Its 
season ticket sales are unspectacu-
lar, as people buy only single per-
formance tickets to hear their favo-
rite music. 

The series· first performer will be 
the Gheorghe Zamfir Ensemble, a 
Rumanian _folk troupe touring the 
U.S. for the first time. Zamfir plays 
the pan-pipe. an ancient wind instru-
ment consbtin~ of wooden tubes of 
varying lengths into which one blows 
to produce sound. Music School Con-
