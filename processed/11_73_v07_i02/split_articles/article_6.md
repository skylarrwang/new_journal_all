greater philosophic effect on Firesign 
humor over the years. "We repre-
sent a Yale frontal attack on 
humor," they say. They love to talk 
about Yale. They love to talk. If 
they hadn't met at Yale, Fire sign 
would never have been: 
Bergman: Proctor and I have a con-
nection through Yale. And that's a 
tremendous connection. We work 
well as a team because we have simi-
lar tastes. 
Proctor: I sat down one evening 
in California on a picture of Peter 
Bergman that was in the Free Press. 
' It said,"KPFK newsman Peter 
Bergman interviews, you know, 
Marvin Chomsky dressed as a sol-
dier on the Strip during the riots. 
Bergman: It was a kid wearing a 
marine jacket. He was one of the 
first people to put on army clothes as 
streetwear. And he was being thrown 
in jail as being a marine out of 
uniform. Proctor: This was the first 
indication I had that Peter was there 
when I was in Los Angeles. So I got 
in touch with him. I was writing for 
" 
a paper called the East Village Other 
then, just for the fun of it, funny 
material. I called Peter and he said, 
"Yeah, I do a show every night on 
KPFK, Radio Free Oz." I said~ 
"Yeah, I've heard about that. ·• He 
said, "Why don't you come on down 
and we'll talk." And we talked about 
Yale first thing. 
Then we started to do improvisa-
tions. B: That's true. That was real 
Firesign Theater, wasn't it? 
P: Peter was doing a theater of learn-
ing on the air. He was using arcane 
subjects like astrology, tarot. 
B: Indian mysticism. P: It was 
really far-out stuff. It was very 
enlightening and very interesting. 
Peter also created the word "love-
in." All of the first love-ins in Cali-
fornia, or most of them, are con-
nected with John Carpenter and 
Peter Bergman. 
Peter introduced me to Phil 
Austin and Dave Ossman. Austin 
was producing a show at the time 
and Ossman was a recently fired 
station manager. We did an improvi-
sation on the air called "The Oz Film 
"Festival", showing movies on the 
air. Everybody believed all the char-
acters that we portrayed, so that's 
how we got started. 
P: It's interesting. Bergman and I 
have been doing Firesign Theater for 
seven years and we've been doing 
double for about a year now. They're 
equal forms. Even me as a single 
actor, I've done some stuff as a 
single actor, and I'm influenced by 
Firesign Theater. That's because 
we're doing our own work. We're like 
singers, musicians. We're singing 
our comedy. Like Peter Cook and 
Dudley Moore. We saw them in New 
York. They're like musicians. 
Everything connects to a hero. 
Because life is sequential. The way 
we relate to things is on a multi-level 
basis. The Firesign Theater magic 
comes out of the relationship of four 
men who .. . B: are radically differ-
ent ... P: are radically different and 
yet have enough edge on their per-
sonalities that they tend to appreci-
ate someone else's attitude or vision 
of something. 

The Firesign Theater 1s not so 
much a theater as it is a combination 
of people and talents. I've always 
had my own private attitudes about 
it. I even have my own private atti-
tudes about our relationship. I'm 
only myself; I'm not my brother's 
keeper. Therefore, if I'm pleased 
with the expression of art that I'm 
involved in (this is only one aspect of 
my life), then what more satisfaction 
do I require? Not just on the artistic 
level, but on the level of my life. Can 
I support myself? Am I comfortable? 
Do I like traveling? Can I stand the 
strain away from my wife? Do I 
enjoy getting together to get crea-
tive ideas together? People that we 
meet contribute to what we do. It's 
an artistic situation. Can we appear 
in public? Can we appear on televi-
sion and do the things that we do 
and perhaps enlighten other people 
who may not be aware of the sort of 
intellectual hard core comedy we're 
involved in? What you were talking 
about ... the records are multi-level 
and deep and they do seem to teach 
many things. I find it exciting and 
enlightening only because I find it 
creatively satisfying. Otherwise I 
wouldn't want to be around it. 

When the projects that Firesign 
Theater was involved in became too 
much of an emotional strain on me 
for various personality reasons, I, 
like the rest of the group, had to 
leave the group and find some other 
alternative until we had cooled out 
sufficiently to be able to relate to one 
another again. When you're together 
for seven or eight years, it is inevi-
table ... B: Changes happen. P: Just 
like a family. You're together and 
then Sissy grows up and Big Brother 
is in a fatal automobile accident, 
Charlie has a terrible affair, scandal-
ized in the papers, Father divorces 
Mother. All those things happen in 
the normal life of individual men and 
women. And when they're working 
together in alliance, there has to be a 
professional attitude that holds the 
thing together. We are very sensitive 
personalities, and when it isn't work-
ing personally for us, we just can't 
work together. We have had several 
sabbaticals since we've been togeth-
er, and the difficulty has always been 
that the Firesign Theater would hold 
to the form of work as the only thing 
that could keep life and limb togeth-
er. In other words, the focus was the 
Firesign Theater. It was everything. 

If the Firesign Theater didn't 
exist, there was nothing. That was 
cause for great emotional anxiety, 
much of it ill-founded. Whenever one 
member or a combination of mem-
bers wanted to do something by 
themselves, the other members 
would balk at this and hold to it 
like a love affair. And I think as 
we've grown and matured, married 
and divorced, lost friends and gained 
friends, made money and lost 
money-all those things that happen 
to you-we have maintained among 
ourselves a sort of loving attitude 
that has to do with the joy that 
we get out of creating together and 
making material that, when it really 
works for us, we hope will influence a 
large audience. 

P: When we first did Firesign 
Theater, we really didn't have in 
mind any audience at all. To this 
day, we don't really have an audience:> 
in mind when we do the Firesign 
Theater material. B: We just please 
each other. P: Right, we just please 
each other. We are the school, we 
are the audience, it is the language 
between us. It has its own unique 
magic. 

B: Firesign Theater really hasn't 
changed that much. P: Not really. 
Our next record, you'll see, is a blend 
of what we've done before in a sort of 
Nick Dangeresque form. The only 
thing that I can see is happening, 
what Peter and I ate certainly aware 
of, is that it's becoming a little more 
cinematic. It's inevitable for the 
Firesign Theater to make a movie. 
Peter and I are making movies now. 
B: We just finished making a movie 
now. P: Yes, just yesterday. Today. 
Hey, it's still today. 

How do we create our material? 
Well, we plan it. We do planet. Daily 
planet. Actually, we worked together 
on a fairly ritualistic basis. We would 
say: OK. we'll define a goal we want 
to accomplish. we Y..ill commit our-
selves to the project. and we will 
create a source of income to sustain 
the project. Let's say it's a Columbia 
record. OK. Get a project number 
and ask for an advance in a certain 
amount, plan our studio time, where 
we're going to do it, plan the piece, 
and decide how much time we want 
to give ourselves to create it. 

Now those are all pretty mature 
determinations, and some artists 
don't work that way at all. Some 


--- Page 8 ---

artists work on a slow basis, with 
no real schedule, but this is the way 
the Firesign does it because there 
are four personal lives involved. So 
we come together, we put our minds 
to it, we enjoy the project, what 
comes out of it comes out of it, we 
create it, we put it on the record, 
we listen to it, make determinations 
and judgments about the design of 
the cover and it comes out. If it's 
not that, it's a movie, a radio show 
for a week or twelve weeks or fifteen 
weeks, and that involves making 
discs that we can put out to people if 
it's funny. So each project has its 
parameters. Proctor and Bergman do 
the same thing. 

Dave Ossman just put out an 
album called "How Time Flies", in 
which Peter and I and the rest of the 
Firesign Theater appear. I think 
there are more multiple projects in 
the offing for the Firesign Theater, 
because that's what splitting up for a 
while was about. Can we as individ-
uals, now that we've proved that 
there's a Firesign Theater, do things 
on our own? Can we still come 
together in different combinations 
and create art? And what will it be 
like? What'll happen if Bergman and 
Proctor get together? What'll hap-
pen if Bergman and Ossman get 
together? What'll happen if Proctor 
and Ossman get together? What'll 
happen if Bergman and Ossman and 
pen if Proctor and Bergman and 
Ossman and Austin get together on 
a project by Proctor and Bergman? 
See. This is the kind of thing that 
we're investigating. We hope it'll be 
more fascinating. 

I liked creative work at the 
Dramat, the Drama School, 
theater ... Theater was the thing that 
I was most interested in. It was 
one of the things which helped keep 
me sane during the Yale period, 
because you know there are lots of 
pressures when you're in school. I 
tried to choose courses that were 
enlightening to me in regard to the 
things that I wanted to do. I took 
a lot of philosophy courses, political 
philosophy, Shakespearean courses, 
literary courses, language courses (I 
spoke French and Russian because of 
a lot of training I had earlier than 
Yale). 

In extracurricular activities, I did 
singing and theater more than any-
thing else, and it was a great school 
for me in that regard. The thing I 
had felt about schools was that they 
never taught the skills, they never 
taught, they never trained the brain. 
They drained the brain, but they 
didn't train the brain. It was like 
demanding things of you they dido 't 
instruct you to perform. You can 
teach memory courses, you can teach 
self-hypnosis, you can teach lan-
guage courses in new ways. B: Uni-
versities and colleges teach you to be 
teachers, not learners. P: Yes, they 
teach you to be teachers. B: They've 
learned how to learn and they pass 
on those techniques. Some people 
stay here and become teachers; other 
people go off and become other 
things. You look back at your Yale 
experience and you say, "Well, I 
learned how to be a teacher, I learned 
how to do research, I learned how to 
use a library." P: Yeah, school of 
intellect as opposed to school of 
mind. B: Yes, it's not a school of 
mind. 

P: A school is an environment 
that people come to, it's like a little 
city. B: That's why they should 
make it as unrestricted as possible, 
because it is an environment. P: 
Yeah, right. But when it was restrict-
ed, people still had to respond. The 
stakes were high. The people still 
would respond in terms of their own 
nature. Some people repressed their 
nature so horribly that they self-
destructed. 

B: The first day here I realized 
that it was not what I had imagined 
it to be, because YALE was this 
four-letter word that was this 
.. 
Volum/seven, number two 1 November 25,19731 8 
thing-it had to be perfect, or at 
least it had to be incredible. And I 
got here and it was Yale, a set of 
buildings and people. You know, it 
was just life. 

I have a double feeling about 
Yale. I '11 always return to it. I'll 
return to it for the rest of my life. 
P: Schizophrenic! B: Yes, truly 
schizophrenic. At one point, it was a 
lot of hate-there were no girls, it 
was totally organized- I felt 
trapped. But at the same time I 
really dug the fact that I was at Yale. 
At some point, I was purely what 
you would call a snob. But being a 
snob was underapprr:iated. If you 
find a place that's cqmfortable and 
safe for you, then y~u can be accused 
of being a snob. Bu you just go to 
where you're safe, ou know. I felt 
so safe here I stayea six years. I 
couldn't leave. 

I think one of the things Yale 
teaches you just l}Y its environment 
is that. it gives you a chance to feel 
what it's like to ~e successful. This 
building is successful. Yale is suc-
cessful. P: This room is successful. 
B: You can get in touch immediately 
with large architecture, large goals, 
large ideas. There's no doubt about 
it. That's what you're rubbing up 
against. No matter what you want to 
do, be a lawyer for the poor, 
you've spent four years touching up 
against that much wealth, that much 
success. The discipline, too. It's all 
around you. 

Proctor and I represent a sort of 
Yale frontal attack on creating a new 
comedy. It's Yale in that it's rather 
fearless, courageous, macho in a 
sophisticated sort of way, and sopho-
moric and collegiate like the other 
side of Yale is. It's very vulnerable 
and kiddish, and it's not hard-edged. 
Yale is not hard-sell. When was the 
last time anyone came around here 
since you've been in and put any 
kind of pressure on you? They really 
treat you like a member of the select 
family. 

I was thinking big when I left 
here, and I'm sure Proctor was. 
P: Sure. B: I didn't know what I 
wanted to do. I had rejected being a 
Supreme Court Justice. I looked at 
all those things, you know. I didn't 
want to become the chief rabbi. 
I toyed with all these things, but I 
left Yale not knowing where I was 
going. I only knew that something 
was going to happen. 

· P: Even my secret society, Scroll· 
and Key, had that kind of effect on 
me. There were certain nights, 
Thursday and Sun~ay nights, you 
were supposed to meet, and I just 
couldn't be there. Now you know it 
was the tradition that you were 
there. Somebody would disappear 
from a certain function because they 
had to be there. But it was more 
important to me to be at a rehearsal 
for something that I was. doing than 
it was to be involved in that other 
activity. So I drew a solar plexus 
strain, a nervous strain during that 
time, because poomp! there was a 
commitment to this thing that had 
certain regulations and foum! there 
was the instinct of my heart, my 
mind, my feeling, and my spirit 
that wanted to be somewhere else 
expressing itself another way. And I 
made those choices and was respon-
sible for them. 

Again, that's why I say, Yale 
tempered a lot of the attitudes that I 
have now, that I've expressed in 
humor. I saw a lot of things at 
Yale. They were quite clear and 
really much like what was happening 
on the outside at that time. But 
on a smaller scale, a scale that was a 
little easier to comprehend. And it 
was certainly a family feeling that 
welcomed us here, which is why I 
think it's so fascinating that you 
have now more of a universal family 
in Yale itself. It seems to be a warm 
and friendly place, a friendly school, 
and the kind of openness that exists 
now is much more real than the kind 
of fellowship that existed when we

were at Yale. But fellowship was 
also real. Maybe it had to be at a 
cocktail party. B: Remember? It was 
all males. P: Sure. All males. There 
were strange ways for men to get 
together. But they were humanly, in 
the heart and the mind, as real as 
anything could be. If they weren't 
real, they weren't real because the 
friendships weren't there. Women · 
were out of it. They just didn't 
exist. 

Yale represented then, as it prob-
ably does now, a microcosm of the 
world outside, and it was still a very 
gray-flannel world at that time. It 
was useless. B: It had no hippies. 
P: No hippies, hipless pants, and 
buttons in the back. B: Just before 
the change. 

I had my first joint sophomore 
year from Eddie Kramer, Class of 
'62. P: Eddie Kramer, right, and the 
first man in my class to die. B: 
Right, flew into a mountain in a 
plane. Chilean Airlines, or something 
like that. Remember Eddie Kramer? 
He was with Ginsberg in Europe, 
he brought back some Nepalese 
grass. It was in freshman quad. I 
was already a sophomore, and I went 
over to visit him. 

I went up to his room and he 
showed me this book with pictures of 
Ginsberg and all these other people. 
I vaguely knew who they were. He 
said, "Here's this grass I brought 
back from Nepal." He rolled up a J 
and I took two or three tokes. 
P: You didn't call them tokes or a J 
then, did you? B: No, no. I didn't 
toke on a nice J. I think he had 
this cigarette-looking thing ... It was 
thin and it was white cigarette paper, 
and it was unrolled. It was obviously 
a hand-rolled cigarette. I smoked on 
it two or three times and nothing 
happened. Had it, I have since 
thought, my entire life would have 
changed. P: But your life wasn't 
ready to change. B: No, it wasn't. 

P: I smoked marijuana several 
times before it had an effect on me 
that was important in my life. That 
was because the time at which it 
became important to me, it was 
introduced to me by a man who 
became my friend. Really, more than 
a man, it was Brandon Dewilde, who 
was an actor and who recently died. 
We became very close. I was under-
studying Brandon in a Broadway 
show. 

All this happened because I came 
to Yale to become involved in the 
Drama School, which turned out to 
be a stiff. Instead, the Dramat hap-
pened. In the Dramat in '62 were 
Austin Pendleton, who was in 
Peter's class, and Skip Hennett, and 
Sam W aterston, and Tom Liggenn 
and Billy Hennett B: and Peter 
Hunt P: Peter Hunt, actor, lighting 
man, talented director, and many, 
many talented people who were just 
there. 

Peter and I knew each other at 
Yale because Peter used to work with 
Austin Pendleton in writing Tom 
Jones and Brewster's Back in Town. 
We were not friends, we were profes-
sional associates. B: Professional 
acquaintances. P: Peter was involv-
ed in politics on the campus at that 
time, and I didn't really relate to 
this very well. I had been to the 
Soviet Union and I kind of had a 
human feeling about politics ... 

I always wanted to be in the 
theater. The only reason I came to 
Yale was because of the Yale Drama 
School. But it was like the dino-
saurs: it was the end of an era. The 
techniques they were teaching, the 
manner in which they were teaching 
them, the staff, although they were 
dedicated to the theater, they were 
representative of the theater of 
another century. 

The acting classes, I remember, 
consisted of tearing the ego of the 
individual artist down to the bare 
bones and then teaching technique 
from that. B: The dead man , yes. P: 
''Now you read this way, and you 
pronounce this way, and you create 
this way." What was interesting 
about that, and what made that 
work in spite of its limitation, 
was the same thing that I found 
exciting about Yale when I was here. 
The rules that were supposed to 
govern your behavior were in many 
instances so inhuman and ludicrous 
that the individuals who chose to 
fight against them became quite 
creative. 

When I was at Yale, there were 
many absurd experiences. Was I 
crazy? No, I was in theater. B, mim-
icking: "I wasn't crazy, I was in 
theater." P:I was around girls, and I 
had relationships of my own, and I 
was proud of them because I felt 
they were real and important to my 
life. So I used to walk girls into 
Trumbull right under the eyes of 
these campus cops, the CC, an~ they 
never even saw it, because I refused 
to live by the arbitrary rules. I 
thought it was ludicrous, a game. If I 
had ever been called on it, I would 
have gone the limit to reveal the 
absurdity of the situation. 

But funny things happened while 
I was at Yale. There was one night 
when I came back from a rehearsal at 
the Dramat and was walking along 
the street towards Trumbull and I 
saw a roommate of mine wearing a 
turtle shell on his head and on top of 
it was a candle which was lit and 
burning. This was Clyde. Walking 
about ten feet behind him wearing 
the hat and suit which they always 
wore was a campus policeman, trail-
ing him. I said, "Hi, Clyde. What 
happened? What's going on?" He 
said, "My girl is pregnant and I'm 
celebrating. I'm going to get 
married." He was living with this 
girl on weekends (and sometimes 
during the week) in the room with 
the three of us in Trumbull. He'd 
sneak her in in various ways. She 
was a smart girl. 

I had constructed this thing called 
a 'room at the top'. I don't know if 
you still have those double-decker 
beds or not. Anyway, I had taken a 
bed cover and hung it over the frame 
so that there was a nice little private 
kind of a tent at the top and then I 
put one at the bottom for my friend 
from Africa, from Johannesburg. 
He's a poet now, he's writing poetry. 
I've run into him a couple of times in 
California. 

In any event, that was happening. 
The other guy was down the hall in 
this complex (I later had my own 
room in Trumbull) and he was a 
· thief. His father was a famous 
American composer, but he was a 
kind of kleptomaniac, but in a hu-
morous way. He was another kind of 
crazy, drop-out person. I mean he 
used to go steal plastic Jesuses from 
the dashboards of cars and he'd line 
them up on our fireplace mantle. 
Some of them glowed in the dark. 

The other guy who was in there 
was an electronics genius. This was 
all in like '61, '62. He rigged the 
entire room for sound, so we could do 
all our phone calls over stereo speak· 
ers, and he constructed a light in the 
center of the room. He meticulously 
drilled a hole through a large brandy 
snifter, filled it with crushed auto 
glass from a shatterproof window 
and put little lights in it, running an 
invisible wire through it with a pul-
sator. Incredible! And this was 
before drugs. This was purely an 
attitude of life, and it existed like a 
flower grows in pavement, in the 
mystic gray walls of Yale at that 
time. All the things that people did 
in their sexual and social behavior 
were kind of absurd explosions of 
erratic repressed behavior patterns, 
and they were all very amusing in 
their own way and very horrifying 
on another level. But, in essence, it 
was as free a community as you 
wanted to make it. 0
