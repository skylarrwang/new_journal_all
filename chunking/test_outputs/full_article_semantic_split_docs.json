The trustees of\nthe Yale Corporation, which holds\n103,600 shares in GM, abstained from\nvoting on the shareholder resolutions. They did so, they explained, \" on the\nprinciple that the Fellows of the\nCorporation do not, and should not,\nhave the power to take a corporate\nposition on issues of a social or political\nnature. This principle derives from the\nphilosophy that a university is a\ncollegium or forum for the expression\nof a wide diversity of views. This\nconception is the cornerstone of\nacademic freedom.\" In doing so, the\nYale Corporation took the stance that\nits investments were \"neutral,\" and\nthat the mere act of owning and\nbenefitting from shares in no way\nimplies support or criticism of a\ncompany's actions. The trustees\nmaintained that to remain silent is to\nremain neutral.",
  "A year later, this statement met with\nserious questioning in a seminar\nproject led by Professor John Simon of\nthe Law School.",
  "The project\nformulated a set of guidelines for the\nconsideration of ethical questions\nrelated to investments. Yale responded\nby setting up the University-wide\nAdvisory Committee on Investment\nResponsibility. This body received as\nits sole power, however, the task of\nreviewing shareholder resolutions\nintroduced by other shareholders and\nadvising the Corporation on how it\nshould vote. The Advisory Committee\nhas never introduced a resolution of its\nown, and its recommendations are not\n\nYale's investments in companies\noperating in the Republic of South\nAfrica pose a serious challenge to this\nstance of neutrality. It is becoming\nincreasingly obvious that American\ninvestments there both directly and\nindirectly support the racist regime of\nJohn Vorster.",
  "Examples of direct aid\nare well known: IBM (Yale shares\n67,650) leases computers to the South\nAfrican police and prisons for the\nenforcement of the repressive passbook\nlaws; GM and Ford (Yale shares\n103,600and 127,500 respectively)\nsupply trucks to the military; Citicorp\nand J.P. Morgan (Yale shares 36,900\nand 35,200) made loans totalling\n$110 million to the South African\ngovernment in 1976 alone.",
  "But the\npresence of foreign investment by its\nvery nature, through the promotion of\ncapital-intensive-and highly\ntechnological industry, supports the\nwhite regime indirectly by serving only\nthe needs of the white population. Ambassador Radha Krishna Ramphul,\nupcoming President of the U.N. Security Council, told the Council in\nMarch of this year,\n\n\"It is crystal clear that foreign\ninvestment is not geared to improving\nthe situation in Southern Africa at\npresent. Foreign funds are not directed\nto agricultural development in the\nrural areas or to social programmes\nwhich would benefit the life of\nAfricans. The South African\ngovernment is not using those\nfunds...",
  "to dismantle apartheid in some\nabsentminded way. To the contrary,\nthanks to foreign investment and\nforeign loans, the South African\ngovernment has been able to build and\nmaintain a garrison state.\"\n\nIn addition, the recently enacted South\nAfrican law requiring foreign concerns\neither to produce what the government\norders or to face nationalization of\ntheir assets makes every corporation,\nwillingly or unwillingly, an accomplice\nto the continuation of apartheid. In view of such evidence, it is plain\nthat American corporate investment in\nSouth Africa is by no means neutral,\nbut is a bulwark in the fortress of\napartheid. This fact calls Yale's\nsupposed neutrality in investments\ninto serious question. If Yale continues\nto reap the benefits of the profits on\noppression in South Africa and\nremains silent, can it still claim that it\nis taking no stance? Is not this very\nsilence a position in support of foreign\ninvestment in South Africa, in support\nof apartheid? -by Nick Olcott and Alisa Klaus\n\nFor those of you who do not speak\nScientist, the title of writer-director\nSteven Spielberg's latest feature\ndescribes an intimate inter-planetary\nrendez-vous.

Rather, it is an allegorical\nsci-fi melodrama about two people\nwhose intitial, illuminating brief\nencounter with a U.F.O. leaves them\nhaunted by its mysterious shape unt\u0131l\nthey find cosmic vindication of their\nvision. Close Encounters is an\nenjoyable minor fantasy on eternal\nthemes, but Spielberg's theological\npremise is shamelessly commerical and\nabsurdly simplistic. Alas, at the film's\nend I found myself quite as lost in the\nproverbial stars as I had been when I\nhopefully paid my $4.50; and to my\nsense of injury at the poverty of the\nspiritual transaction was added the\nequally enduring (albeit less\nexistential) insult of actual penury.",
  "After the film opens with the\ntraditional blinding explosion of white\nlight, the director thrusts us inside a\nMexican desert sandstorm reminiscent\nin ferocity of the Seven Plagues of\nEgypt. Here scientists are conducting a\nsearch for clues regarding the existence\nof extra-terrestrial life forms.",
  "When\nan inexplicably contented old man\nstammers in Spanish that \"the sun has\nsung\" to him, it is clear to all and\nsundry that something is rotten in the\nsolar system. Spielberg then transports\nus to the little house on the prairie in\nMuncie, Indiana, where Jillian Guiler\n(Milinda Dillon) lives with her toddler\nson, Barry. To his mother's horror,\nBarry is lured into the night by\nseductive extra-terrestrial vibes.",
  "She\ngives chase and catches him on a\ndeserted highway where both Guilers\nrun into Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfus),\na neighbor who claims to have seen an\nUnidentified Flying Object. As the\nadults stand arguing by the roadside,\nseveral 1977-style flying saucers fly by. Barry, delighted by the evocative\nconical Shape he perceives, trills out,\n\"Ice cream!\" Although Ronni Neary\n(Terri Garr) is understandably skeptical\nwhen her husband recounts his\nadventures, reports of strange\nphenomena all over the world (the\nearth) are released shortly, and Roy\nand Jillian rightly begin to suspect that\nthe fault is not in themselves but in\ntheir stars after all. In one of the picture's most striking\nscenes, little Barry is kidnapped by\nclouds of fire.",
  "Despite his mother's\ndesperate attempts to keep him locked\nin the house while star wars rage\noutdoors, he unerringly walks to the\nsingle unlocked door and opens it. The\nvisual allusion to The Wizard of Oz\nbecomes manifest: standing on the\nthreshold of a singing sun, Barry looks\nfor all the world like Dorothy opening\nthe door from her black-and-white\nKansas homestead into the infinitely\nmore vivid polychromatic Land of Oz. Like a supersonic Pied Piper, the\nU.F.O.",

Introduced to California in the mid-1800's, the grape probably originated somewhere in Europe, perhaps Italy.",
  "Nevertheless it is today considered a wine unique to California. For years, Zinfandel was dismissed as a rather ordinary varietal well suited for jug wines and blending. Recent vintages, however, have produced a wine that is truly excellent and distinguished. Wide variations exist among wines labeled Zinfandel. Since Zinfandel grapes raisin easily in warm climates, it is at its best in the cool north coast vineyards. Zinfandels range from light fruity wines which are quite drinkable when only a few years old to big inky-black wines rich in tannin that will require many years of bottle age to reach their peak.

If\nyou feel that you are deficient in this\nrespect, a decade at the Museum of\nBroadcasting should bring you up to\nstandard. On November 9, 1976, The\nMuseum of Broadcasting was\nestablished at 1 East 53rd Street under\na personal grant from William S. Paley\nas \"the first American museum\ndedicated to the study and\npreservation of the more than fifty-year\nhistory of radio and television\nbroadcasting.\" So far, over 16,000\npeople have visited the museum. Founder Paley, also the Chairman\nof CBS-TV, says that he recognized\nthe need for a \"concerted and\norganized preservation effort\" in\n1966. The following year the William\nS. Paley Foundation conducted\nstudies on the feasibility of a major\npermanent facility. The National En-\ndowment on the Arts supported this\nresearch endeavor with a matching\ngrant. Since its triumphant inception the\nMuseum has been enthusiastically\nsupported by all of the networks,\npublic broadcasting, the National\nAssociation of Broadcasters, and\nseveral distinguished independent\nbroadcasters. Ahern is now permitted\nto request up to 300 hours each of\nTV and radio and broadcasting from\neach of the three networks every\nmonth. She anticipates owning\napproximately seven thousand TV\nshows and 150,000 radio broadcasts\nby the end of 1980.",
  "Most of the present selections have\nnot been shown publicly since their\noriginal airing, and a great many are\nfrom the first five years of large-scale\nTV broadcasting, 1948 to 1953. The\nMuseum features Joe McCarthy's self-\ndefense on \"See It Now,\" Fred Allen's\n\"Town Hall Tonight,\" and uncut\ntelecasts of the Kennedy-Nixon\ndebates. Also available for your\nlistening pleasure are some of the\nearliest broadcasts in existence: Bing\nCrosby's Rhythm Boys singing with\nPaul Whiteman's orchestra, Lucky\nLindy's jubilant return to America\nand Mom, and a quantity of speeches\nmade by FDR, the earliest of which is\ndated 1920 (he was but a young\nsprout of thirty-eight years). There\nare also a number of fascinating and\nhorrible wartime radiocasts made by\npro-Axis Americans and Englishmen.",
  "Hear 'em and weep. At the museum, in the Broadcast\nStudy Center, I espied a technician\nindustriously watching TV at her desk\nin the attractive, Jetsonesque room\nwhere audio and video tapes are\npresented. The architect responsible\nfor the pleasantly futuristic design is\nMr. John Beyer, head of a firm\nbearing the suggestively homophonic\nname of Beyer, Blinder and Bell. Said\nmuseum technician seemed to be on a\nfirst-name basis with some of the\nvisitors; later she told me that several\nmembers of the museum arrive every\nday at lunchtime to watch a favorite\nshow. \"We've got a couple of fanatics\nwho are systematically going through\nall of the episodes of 'Playhouse 90'\nand 'Studio One',\" she confided. She\nalso profferred a list of the Most\nRequested Tapes: The Beatles on \"Ed\nSullivan,\" \"The Best of Ernie\nKovacs,\" \"Amos 'n Andy,\" and \"Peter\nPan.\" My visual appetite whetted by\nthis tempting menu, I entered the\nIndex Room. The Index Room contained peri-\nodicals, a large central table, a wall\ncovered with file cabinets, and a\ntelevision. Onscreen Alistair Cooke\nwas graciously welcoming us all to\nthe museum. An introductory teletape\neffectively communicated the diversity\nof the material in storage, from\nspeeches of all the presidents of the\nUnited States since radio waves have\nfilled the air, to the comedy routines\nof Bert Lahr and Bea Lillie. It\ndescribed radio and TV productions\nof classical drama, Judy Garland's\nradio debut at the tender age of\ntwelve (as Ross MacDonald said, \"I\ndon't believe that people know every-\nthing at birth and forget it as they\ngrow older\" the early Judy is less\nthan spectacular) and a television\nappearance by Arturo Toscanini who,\nat 84, apparently hadn't forgotten a\ndamned thing. There aren't many\ncartoons among the varied holdings,\nexcept for made-for-TV animation\nmovies, but the Museum of Broad-\ncasting does maintain a library of rare\nbooks and television scripts, as well\nas books and periodicals on the\nindustry.",
  "Visitors to the museum have ready\naccess to this taped wonderland.",
  "In\nthe Index room, one selects programs\nfrom an extensive, computer-\ngenerated file of index cards, and\nreserves time at one of the custom\ndesigned broadcast consoles. In spite\nof myself, I looked up Yale in the file\nand found, in addition to two\nunexplained tapes of old Hasty\nPudding shows from the 1930's, the\n1957 Omnibus production of Owen\nJohnson's Stover at Yale. Secure in one of eight consoles,\neach of which accommodates three\npeople, I settled in for a broadcasting\nblitz.",
  "The museum technician on duty\nlocked the tapes into place, and I\nattached one of the three sets of\nheadphones to my eager ears. Always\na sucker for Viennese schmaltz, I\nlistened to Romberg's operetta, The\nNew Moon. The romantic reverie 1\nfell into while listening to a quavery\nsoprano warble \"Lover, Come Back\nto Me\" was harshly interrupted by a\ncommercial for Zlotnick's Furrier,\ncirca 1937, and that cattiest of feline\nfilms, The Women. I heard the ineffable and probably\ninebriated John Barrymore give a\nsuperb reading of Hamlet's soliloquies\nin a rather absurd 1937 radio show\nentitled \"Streamlined Shakespeare.\"\nAh, if only he had had a better\neditor!

  "Recent\nadvances in cryptography, the art of\nsecret cipher-coding of messages, have\nassured that this mail will only be\ndecipherable and readable by its\nintended recipient. The proof of this\nassertion comes from the \"purest\"\nsubjects in mathematics, algebra and\nnumber theory, as well as the\ntheoretical area known as \"compu-\ntational complexity\". Finally, we will\nall have pre-programmed, special-\npurpose personal computers to do\nthis enciphering and deciphering, and\nthese machines will most likely be\ncheap enough to get free in a box of\nCheerios.

Another more secure cryptographic\nsystem is the transmission of private\nkey for a specific message. This key\nwould be a list of random numbers as\nlong as the message to be transmitted.

The key could be intercepted\nand copied before it reaches the\nrecipient, and the message decoded\neasily. And if a lot of messages are\nbeing sent, the problem of syn-\nchronizing the proper keys with their\nassociated messages becomes very\ncomplicated. For extended communi-\ncations between a large number of\nparties, the one-time key system is a\nhopeless mess. **One Way Functions**\n\nThe inspiration for the first major\nbreakthrough in cryptographic re-\nsearch came from Whitfield Diffie\nand Martin Hellman of Stanford\nUniversity. Their work appeared in\n\"New Directions in Cryptography\"\n(IEEE Transactions on Information\nTheory, November 1976). Diffie and\nHellman propose a cryptographic\ntechnique called the \"public key\ncryptosystem\" which relies on a group\nof coding functions called \"one-way\ntrapdoor functions.\" These functions\nare easy to carry out, but like a\ntrapdoor, very difficult to reverse. The characteristics for a good one-\nway trapdoor function are the\nfollowing:\n\n1. All messages are simply coded into\n    integers by changing A to 01, B to\n    02, and so on.",
  "Then we only have\n    to \"code\" and \"decode\" large\n    numbers.",
  "2. There are two encoding and de-\n    coding procedures f and g which\n    inverses of one another. If a text\n    is simply coded into a number N,\n    we encode the message by sending\n    the number M = f(N), and M is\n    decoded by computing g(M) =\n    g(f(N)), which (if our coding\n    procedures work) must be N. Therefore g(f(N)) = N. Since\n    encoding and decoding are es-\n    sentially the same kind of opera-\n    tion, changing one number to\n    another, it is also true that\n    f(g(N)) = N. 3. The encoding and decoding pro-\n    cedures f and g can both be done\n    quickly. 4. The \"trapdoor\" condition: Given\n    the procedure f, it is compu-\n    tationally infeasible for anyone to\n    break the code and derive g. With these conditions, it is easy to\ndescribe an efficient communications\nsystem.",
  "Every user A who wishes to\nparticipate in this message sending\nscheme has his own encoding and\ndecoding machines. Let's call them f\nand ga. User A makes his encoding\ndevice f public and sends one to all\nhis friends with the following mes-\nsage: \"If you want to send me some\nelectronic mail, type it into vour\nelectric message sender and encode it\nwith my fA machine just before you\nmail it.\" His decoding device,gA,\nhowever, he keeps a secret, so only he\nhas a copy of it. This way, no one\nbesides A will be able to decode\n\nmessages sent to A. **Computer Crime and\nDigital Signatures**\n\nThe single problem with this design\nis that it is only secure at one end. When B sends a message to A, it is\nclear that only A can read it.",
  "But it is\nstill possible that B did not send the\nmessage, for another individual C\ncould be impersonating B and writing\nmessages in B's name. It is this loophole that has been\nexploited in an increasingly popular\npublic offense known as computer\ncrime, namely ripping off with\nmachines for fun and profit.",
  "An\nexcellent summary of such criminal\nexploits can be found in a two-part\nseries which appeared in the New\nYorker this summer (\"Annals of\nCrime (Computers - I and 11),\"\nAugust 22, 1977 and August 29,\n1977). Consider a bank that has a\ncomputerized account system. If a\nbank teller can learn to impersonate\nthe bank president on the computer,\nthe teller can learn the balance of\nspecial accounts, shift money from\none account to another (which in-\nvolves a mere change of numbers\nstored in computer memory), and\ngenerally make a mess of things. In a\nbank without a computer system of\nthis sort, such activity would be\nimpossible. First, the bank teller\ndoesn't look like the bank president,\nso personal attempts would obviously\nfail if he tried to ask the accountant\nanything. Second, a written request\nwould probably fail, since those in the\nknow would see that the signature at\nthe bottom of the bank president's\npurported request was not authentic. In either case the fraud might easily\nbe traced back to the bank teller. The clever solution to this problem\nof anonymity is what Diffie and\nHellman call \"digital signatures\". Here is how it works: Suppose B\nwants to send A a message N.",
  "B has a\npublic encoding device fs (of which A\nand everyone else has a copy) and a\nsecret decoding device ga. Similarly,\nA has a public encoding device f\n(which B knows) and his own\ndecoding device ga, also secret. To\nsend the message N, B first encodes\nthe message with f, and then codes\nthe result with his own device ga, and\nsends the message g(f(N)). When A\nreceives the message, he first decodes\nit with B's public coder fs, and then\ngets fA(N), as fe and ga are mathe-\nmatical inverses. A then applies his\nprivate decoding device ga to fa(N). and out comes the message N!",
  "This method is absolutely secure. The reason is that when B sent the\nmessage to A, he used his secret\ncoding device gs. For someone to\nimpersonate B, they would have to\nfigure out how to derive gs from f. and this should be next to impossible. Coding a message with your own\nsecret g-machine is a way of \"signing\"\nthe message, because no one else can\nduplicate that coding procedure. Such\na public key cryptosystem can resist\nthe strongest form of cryptographic\ncode breaking, the \"chosen plaintext\nattack.\"\n\nThe secret of the one-way trapdoor\nfunction is pretty much out of the\nbag. The details of the prime number\nimplementation (as mentioned by\nMartin Gardner in the \"Mathematical\nGames\" section of Scientific Ameri\ncan, August 1977) can be found in a\npaper called \"On Digital Signatures\nand Public-Key Cryptosystems\"\n(Technical Memo 82, April 1977),\navailable for 35 cents and a stamped\naddressed envelope by writing to Dr.",

  "At\nlast count, Rivest had received on the\norder of two thousand requests for\nthis paper, as yet unanswered. Why is\nProfessor Rivest such a poor corres-\npondent? Because of the National\nSecurity Agency. The explanation for this state of\naffairs gained public attention in a\nfront-page New York Times article\n(October 19, 1977), entitled \"Scien-\ntists Accuse Agency of Harassment\nOver Code Studies.\" A source at the\nNational Science Foundation, which\nfunds much of the research described\nhere, complained that NSA was\nengaging in \"systematic, bureaucratic\nsniping\" in an attempt to control this\nresearch. The article appeared a week\nafter a conference on information\ntheory was held at Cornell University\nin Ithaca, N.Y.",
  "Several weeks before the con-\nference, its sponsors, the Institute of\nElectric and Electronic Engineers\n(IEEE), received a letter from one of\nits members, Joseph A. Meyer. Ac-\ncording to the Times, well-placed\nscientists claim that Meyer is em-\nployed by the NSA. Meyer warned\nthat publication and distribution of\nscientific papers on cryptography,\npresented at the upcoming conference,\nwould be in violation of the 1954\nMunitions Control Act, known cur-\nrently as the Arms Export Control\nAct. Lawyers from the IEEE, Stan-\nford, and MIT generally concurred\nwith this view.",
  "Scientific research is\nroutinely sent abroad to nations all\nover the world, including the Soviet\nUnion. The new research could be\nused to create security systems for\nmilitary communications that would\nbe impenetrable by the KGB, the\nSoviet intelligence agency. Of course,\nshould the Soviets or any other\nnation employ the same techniques,\nthe NSA and C.I.A. would be equally\nunable to break the code. Hence\npublicizing this research is roughly\nsynonymous with exporting arma-\nments to the military menace emanat-\ning from Moscow.",
  "This set the stage\nfor a rather tense conference. At the conference, Diffie and\nHellman presented their results on\nNP problems and their relations to\ncryptography, as briefly described\nabove. Rivest of MIT also presented\nthe MIT group's results on prime-\nnumber encryption. Under advice\nfrom MIT lawyers, however, Rivest\nsaid that he was unable to answer\nquestions on the MIT group's re-\nsearch, although he read the paper he\nhad prepared for the conference. The\nlegal logjam over publication has also\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n# NP Problems and One-Way Functions\n\n### December 6, 1977\n\nNaturally, the above argument assumes that we can really find functions like f and g. But exactly where can such \"hard\" functions be found? Diffie and Hellman suggest the use of a class of exceedingly difficult problems in \"computational complexity\", a sub-branch of theoretical computer science. These are known as \"NP problems\". The \"NP\" here means that a properly stated problem can be solved on a nondeterministic Turing machine in time bounded above by a polynomial function of the size of the problem description. Clear enough? What this means in English is that an NP problem has the following characteristic: Every problem has a \"size\" - let us say that the \"size\" of a problem is the length of its description. Depending on how we look at a problem, we may choose to count the number of letters or words needed to describe the problem, or the number of physical objects to which it refers, and so on. With an NP problem, the number of possible solutions is exponentially related to the problem size, say, for a problem of size x, there are 10 possible solutions. Furthermore, we do not have the faintest intuitive idea as to which possible solution will actually yield the correct answer, so we have to try them all!",
  "One familiar NP problem occurs in symbolic logic and is called the \"satisfiability problem\". Given a statement in sentential logic (ask your roommate, he's in Philosophy 130a, a notorious flamer), which has symbols like \"P\", \"Q\", \"R\" (which stand for statements that may be true or false), such as\n\n((P or not-Q) or R) and\n(not-P or not-R),\n\nis there some assignment of truth or falsity to P, Q, R that makes the whole statement true? Working it out will have to take 2 = 8 cases into consideration, which is done in what\n\nthere are n sentential variables (P, Q, R....) in the sentence, we have to try out 2\" possible solutions.",
  "This is clearly an exponential problem. ### The Knapsack Problem - A Good One-Way Function\n\nDiffie and Hellman use another NP problem called the \"knapsack\" problem to create a one-way trapdoor function. A case of the knapsack problem is the following: I give you a list of 100 random numbers and tell you that a subset of these numbers, added together, equals 490. Find me that subset of integers. There isn't any fast way to find this subset, you're going to have to check them all - and there are 2100 (approximately 1030) possible cases. Have a nice time looking! Here is the essence of a trapdoor function: add up a subset of integers, and transmit the sum. This is easy. The \"decoding\" of the sum into the subset of numbers adding up to it is exponentially hard. If the random numbers were chosen carefully, the recipient of the message can decode the message easily. This is the \"trapdoor\" principle - the creator of the random list can use the \"decode\" key easily, but no curious crypt-analyst can figure it out. Not to be outdone, a group of MIT researchers have come up with an alternate one-way trapdoor function that takes advantage of prime numbers and their bizarre properties. This new method is credited to the efforts of Ronald Rivest (Yale '69 for you alumni fans), Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adelman of MIT. Rivest is an associate professor of electrical engineering.",
  "This group has relied on a host of other results proved by a number of researchers. Here is how the prime number trapdoor works: THE PUBLIC ENCODING KEY (what we called the \"f\" machine): Every person P publishes two big\n\nmessage N to P, raise N to the s-th power, divide it by r, and transmit the remainder. Mathematically, we write this as\n\nE(N) = N' modulo r. The number r is the product of two very large primes, p and q, which are kept secret. The computation E(N) can be done very quickly. THE PRIVATE DECODING KEY (what we called the \"g\" machine before): Take the encoded message M, raise it to the t-th power, divide it by r, and the remainder should be N. This can be expressed as\n\nD(M) = M' modulo r.",
  "The number t depends on the values of p and q, which are kept secret. Knowing t, D(M) can also be quickly calculated. The trapdoor principle here is that while it is computationally easy to find out if a very large number is prime, it is (at least by present knowledge) practically impossible to find all the prime factors of a large number. The MIT researchers picked s = 9007 and r to be a 129 digit number that, if printed here, would almost certainly be incorrectly typeset. The number r is the product of two 64-digit and 65-digit prime numbers. How can we find out if a very large number p is prime?",
  "At first glance this would seem to be a difficult question to solve. But recent investigations by Gary Miller (currently at the University of Rochester) and Michael Rabin (Hebrew University), among others, have shown that it's not as tough as it's initially cracked up to be. Using a variety of classical mathematical arguments including the use of Fermat's Theorem (one of my favorite theorems) and the Extended Riemann Hypothesis (the unextended version is good enough for me, thanks), both conjectured over a century ago, it has been shown that finding primes as big as 2200 is still easy. In fact, a MIT computer programmed with the correct algorithm found such a prime in less than a minute. --- Page 8 ---\n# Taluscope\n### the new journal, december 6, 1977\n\nTalus was the best guard anywhere;\nhis record-breaking total of more that a\n,hundred crushed, burned, and sunken\nships will probably never be matched. Now he wasn't the sort of man to go\naround town saying things like, \"Talus\nhere.",
  "I'm big.",
  "I'm mean.\" Not at all. Of course, he never really went around\ntown at all, seeing as how he lived on\nthe island and never had any dealings\nwith ordinary folks, except when he\nkilled them. He was pretty quiet, most of the\ntime, as big as six regular men, and\nstrong as a whole navy. But he didn't\nkill for pleasure, and not to satisfy an\nugly temper. It was just his job, and he\nhad been made for it. In his younger\ndays he would use what free time he\nhad relaxing in the shallows, watching\nclouds and stars, peaceful things,\nmaybe to make up for the\nship-smashing. He wasn't really so big as you might\nhave heard, what with stories about\nhim tossing around ships and eating\npeople whole. Usually a stranger's ship\nwould sail around to the east side of\nthe island. There was a nice strip of\nsand and a little bay that was protected\nby a rocky cliff about a hundred feet\ntall. Well, Talus had him a cave half\nway up, and he could watch a good bit\nfrom his front door. When he spotted\na speck on the sea, he'd climb to the\ntop of his bluff and wait, maybe catch\na nap while he had time. But when\nthat ship pulled into the calm water,\nTalus would take a running jump and\ncome shooting down like a comet. When he got bored with his bronze\nball dive, he would make some fancy\nflip or twist, then bore right on\nthrough the ship, fingertips first,\nstraight as a plumb. Of course, if his\njumping off place wasn't handy, he\ncould always break a ship in half with\none well-aimed boulder. There's something else about Talus\nnobody seems to know, and that's that\nhe had him a wife.",
  "Sort of a wife, more\nlike a servant, really, named Lysia. She\nwas bronze, too, but her color was\nlighter, more twinkly than Talus. Very\npetite, for a metal woman, maybe ten\nfeet, twelve feet at the most, but\ngoodly portions, as they say. It seems\nthat some witch over in Chelaan\nwanted to outdo Vulcan, and maybe\nshe felt sorry for lonely old Talus, but\nwhyever for, she built Lysia, a worthy\nmate for a creation like he was. Lysia would wait in their cave while\nTalus did his guarding, she would keep\nhim company while he waited on his\ncliff, maybe she changed his oil, I\ndon't know. She did save him from\nbeing alone, and she was not afraid of\nhim.",
  "But they had a problem. The night he died, he spent a while\nover on the southwest beach. He\nwasn't practicing his dives, not sitting\nquiet or waiting for the moon to pop\nout from behind a cloud. That night\nhe stormed around like the old Volcant\nDaddy himself, tearing loose parts of\nthe shore and heaving them in all\ndirections. He yelled, \"Curse\nVulcan!\" and \"Blazes for Chaalia!\"\nover and over (I think Chaalia must\nhave been Lysia's witch mamma), and\nthe whole place shook and echoed. Sometimes he might toss chunks of\nearth for exercise, but only for a\nchange, as cranky Minos didn't\nappreciate having his pile of dirt\nsquandered away. This doesn't much sound like the\ncalm type I was talking about, but he\nwas due for a little tantrum after his\nset-to with Lysia.",
  "That was earlier in\nthe night, and their voices got louder\nand louder till I could hear plain as\nday. First thing I could make out was\nTalus, saying, \"I am bronze, woman,\nnot flesh,\" a nasty sound in him. But quick and loud as you please,\nshe answered back, \"And I am bronze\nand woman, man.'\" Now on paper it's\nhard to tell you how mean she was\nacting, but the way she said \"man\"\nwas enough to make me wither even\nfurther into my hiding place, and\nTalus, he seemed to take it for an\ninsult, too. There was a deep crash,\nlike maybe he punched a hole in their\nliving room wall, and he just boomed,\n\"You are an acorn to this oak!\"\n\n\"And you a mule to this mare,\" she\nsaid, even and ornery. Now the way\nthey talked was funny to me, like they\nwere high-class strangers.",
  "But the way\nwords rang out of their mouths, with a\nkind of instant echo, made everyone\nstick clear in my head. Lysia still was not afraid of him,\nthough he seemed changed, into the\nbellowing bull of stories about him. Then she softened up some, sounded\nmore like a real wife. \"Talus, I am\nsorry. You are a great, a very great\nman, and I have loved you and served\nyou all of my life. But I am not you,\nand not a great man.\" Nobody said\nanything for a little bit, then she went\non. \"Vulcan did not mean for you to\nhave a mate, I know. But I need your\ntouch, your glance, whatever love there\nis. A kiss, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Perhaps the kiss of man would\nserve you better.\" He stomped out of\nthe cave, stopped just outside, and\nlooked back for a second. \"Or ass,\nperhaps,\" he said. Then he took off,\ngoing under me so close I could've\ntouched his head, but right on by he\nwent, like spurs were digging at him. For a while I just lay low, till I heard\nLysia, alone in the cave, crying like a\nreal woman. Let me back up a little, as you may\nbe confused about my being on this\nisland in the first place. I signed on\nwith Jason just before his long trip,\nand he asked for too much to handle\nmore than once; I'm not saying he\ndidn't do his share, but he left a lot of\ndirty jobs to the crew. Everybody was\nscared of Talus, and Jason took that as\na challenge. Just couldn't abide sailing\npast Talus without poking a spear in\nthat general direction. So he handed me a spear and sent\nme and one other fellow to kill Talus. Can't imagine what he was thinking.",
  "Drunk, maybe. We rowed the whole way for fear the\nmoon might shine our sail at the giant,\nand we pulled our little boat up on a\nrocky beach somewhat north of the big\nbay, figuring that's where Talus would\nprobably be watching. He was too\ncaught up in his woman problems to\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n# the new journal, december 6, 1977\n## -by Jim Johnson\n\nnotice us anyway. From where we landed, the only way\nto the rest of the place was over the top\nof the bluff. I had to find him before I\ncould kill him, so my shipmate\nguarded the boat, and away I climbed. From the top, I couldn't see my\ncomrade or the boat; that was good. On the way down the other side, I\nheard the voices ringing from inside,\nand I hid fast, near enough to hear the\nfight, but too close to the cave's\nopening for my liking. It surprised me that somebody like\nTalus would back off from a fight, and\nwith a woman at that, but from their\nargument and the crying, I figured she\nmight be inclined to help me out. I\nnudged my way into the cave, spear\npoint first, ready to hightail. Never saw\na prettier woman, or more pitiful. \"Excuse me,\" I said, and she looked\nup slowly. \"Are you...",
  "Mrs. Talus?\"\nThat didn't seem quite right, but\nsurely only a wife could talk to a giant\nthe way she did. She smiled at\nsomething, the spear still poking\naround in front of me, or maybe the\nquestion, and said, \"Talus has no\nwoman, nor will he have.\"\n\"Does that mean you want to get off\nthis rock?\"\nShe stopped her crying, and very\nladylike, said, \"Whatever I shall find\napart from this island will be island as\nmuch as here I find. I can stay no\nmore.\" Still that funny way of talking,\nstill ringing right in my head, but I\ngathered she wanted to leave Talus. Very polite, I asked her if she wanted\nto make a deal, that she could sail with\nus if she'd tell me how to handle old\nTalus.",
  "At first she couldn't warm up to the\nidea.",
  "She told me not to even think\nabout killing him, that he was really a\nfine man; she was the one I should\nblame. Well, who knows, but I\nbelieved her about Talus having some\ngood in him. She told me how\ndifferent it had been before he started\nbrooding, and about his fancy diving,\nhow he liked the stars and tried not to\nstep on the seashells because they were\npretty. But after all, I had a job to do, and I\nkept after her about Talus' weak spot. Finally, she said, \"To betray his\nsecret's to betray nothing; you may\nknow how he can die, but also know\nyour weakness. He will never allow you\nto kill him. Talus could be killed, she admitted,\nby pulling some kind of plug out of\nhim. Then all of his life-juice or\nwhatever would run out, and he'd die. \"So where's the plug?\"\nShe stood up, but seeing as she's\nkind of tall for me, she got on her\nknees so we'd be more face to face, and\npointed down at my crotch. \"There.\"\n\"You mean his...\" I was still\nlooking for a good word, but she went\non. \"Desire and life are held in him\nthere, by a button, most small, and yet\nin essence larger than himself. From\nmy most willing womanhood he's\nsuffered much; a little man would not\nget even near enough to see it.\" I was\nstill staring down where she had\npointed; came close to asking her how\nTalus managed some certain things\n(one in particular), but I figured he\ncouldn't, at least not without killing\nhimself. \"Right.",
  "Yes. Well, look, there's a\nlittle boat hidden on that beach over\nthe hill. Tell the fellow there that I\nsent you, and wait there. And try not\nto scare him too much.\" She left. All the way across the island you\ncould hear Talus and feel the ground\nshaking. Maybe he wasn't quite as big\nas in the stories, but he sure made up\nfor it in volume.",
  "I started toward the sound of his\nvoice, but before a mile was up, the\nruckus stopped. He was calming down\nsome, maybe he'd go to sleep and I\ncould sneak up on him. Of couse, he\nnever slept, but I had to keep my\nspirits up. Then he was running; I felt each\nbounce and jolt as he headed for\nhome, toward his cave; toward me for\nthat matter. So I turned myself around\nand started running, too. Hid myself\nin his cave just as Talus started up the\ncliff. He called out Lysia's name while\nhe climbed, didn't sound mad\nany more; desperate, if anything. He\ndidn't stop at the cave, just kept\nclimbing and calling to Lysia until he\nreached the top. Didn't make any sense of it till I\ncrept outside for a quick look. Just\nbeyond the still water in the bay, our\nboat's small sail was shining away in\nthe moonlight; my friend Linneus had\nabandoned me. Standing toward the\nfront of the boat, like a figurehead,\nwas Lysia. Even at a good distance you\ncouldn't miss her.",
  "And missing her seemed like the last\nthing on Talus's mind. He tore a huge\nhunk of stone from the cliff and raised\nit over his head. All quiet now, and I\ncouldn't see his face, but the outline of\nhis arms with the boulder towered over\nme, clear against the moon. He tossed\nthat rock with such a snap it sailed out\ntwice as far as the boat, then crushed a\npiece of driftwood and smashed into\nthe sea. The driftwood was gone, and\nthe only other target was our boat. Talus backed away from the cliff's\nedge, and I couldn't see him. I braced\nmyself to see him running off, diving\nthrough Linneus, breaking the boat to\nkindling. After a minute or so he walked back\ninto view.",
  "Saw all of him, watched him\nas he pissed into the ocean. Just what it\nlooked like anyway, kind of\nmatter-of-fact, head down. Looked\nunsteady for a bit, then, not graceful,\nhe followed his water into the bay. I watched as he went under, then\nback to the clifftop, and I shouted and\nwaved to Linneus and Lysia. They\ndidn't come back, but at the top of\nTalus's bluff I found his note, carved\nin stone:\nLysia, bronze and woman, wed\nTo Talus, unwed, bronze, and dead. Took me a year to get off that island,\nand it's a year since, but nobody seems\nto know anything about Lysia.",
  "Maybe\nshe couldn't live without him after all,\nand she's gone; all right.",
  "But these\nstories! I hear talk about Castor and\nPollux and Jason and Medea, but none\nof them were around when Talus died. And Lysia was right-no little man like\nme could've gotten close enough. --- Page 10 ---\n# Nobody does it Banner!",

Schank\nfeels that the best way to make a\nmachine act intelligent is to make it do\nexactly what people do, as close as we\ncan figure out. At an international conference on\nArtificial Intelligence at M.I.T. this\nsummer, Schank was the chairman of\nthe \"Natural Language Processing\"\nsession. In Artificial Intelligence (AI)\njargon, a \"Language\" can be either\n\"natural\", like English or Latin, or\n\"artificial\", like Fortran, which is a\nlanguage designed for computers. The\nAl lab isn't very interested in artificial\nlanguages (which are primarily the\nprovince of the Systems people.) They\nare, however, interested in English,\nand how people use it to communicate\nwith each other and understand what\nthey read. Take this sentence, for example: \"I\nhit Roger Schank in the mouth.\"\nWhen you read that, you not only\nunderstand the physical action that I\nperformed by \"hitting,\" you also\nknow that I must have been next\nto him before I could hit him, and that\nhe was probably amazed that I would\ndo such a thing, (you are too: you\nprobably don't believe that I really did\nit), and you expect me to explain the\naction, or justify it, and you expect\nRoger to hit me back, or order me out\nof his office, or call for help or\nsomething. You know all that just\nfrom my saying that I hit him.",
  "Schank and his group are trying to\nwrite computer programs that will read\na sentence like that and make the same\ninferences that you made when you\nread it. In fact, they have a system,\ncalled \"SAM\", which can actually read\nnewspaper stories and understand\nthem. For example, take this lead\nstory, straight off the UPI wire:\n\"An Iberian tanker today struck a\nreef off the coast of Florida, spilling\ntons of oil into the Atlantic Ocean. Helicopters are keeping the spreading\nspill under observation, and it is not\nyet known whether nearby beaches will\nbe affected.\"\n\nSAM knows all sorts of things about\noil spills, and tankers, and has a\nsmattering of geography, so it can\nanswer questions about the story, like\n\"What caused the oil spill?\". The\nanswer SAM prints back is \"A tanker\nstruck a reef, and the tanker probably\ncracked open, and the oil leaked out\nthe crack.\" Not an answer full of\ninsights, but certainly displaying an\nunderstanding of the physical events\nthat took place. SAM is an expert on\nphysical events.",
  "It understands stories\n\nshould be directed. The main idea is to\nsee if we can make a machine act\n\"intelligent\", although no one really\nagrees on what constitutes intelligence. The programs that have been\nwritten so far in the Al field have been\nstatic, like SAM reading a certain type\nof story from a newspaper. It can read\nthe story, but it can't learn from it. SAM itself is no different after reading\na story than before. It can't make any\nnew inferences, or alter its point of\nview. Rick Granger, a Computer\nScience grad student, is working on an\naddition to SAM that allows it to figure\nout a new word from context. For\nexample, if you read that President\nCarter went to Bagawaga to establish\ndiplomatic relations there, then you'd\nknow that Bagawaga was probably a\ncountry, even though you never heard\nof it before. The reason you can do that\nis that you've already heard a thousand\nstories dealing with Presidents and\ndiplomatic relations, and you know\nthat in general, countries are the things\nthat people go to and establish\ndiplomatic relations with. So you\ninterpret the story in terms of other\nstories like it that you've seen\n\nabout car crashes, earthquakes, oil\nspills, floods, and other disasters. It\ndoes not understand the human\nintentionality behind such stories.",
  "Like\n\"why did the driver lose control of the\ncar?\" or \"how will people react to the\ndamage?\". However, there's another\nprogram at the AI lab called \"Pam\"\nwhich understands exactly that sort of\nthing. PAM reads stories about things\nlike robberies, and understands the\nmotivations behind people involved in\nsuch activities. It's not going to solve\nany serious sociological problems about\nwhy people perform robberies, but it's\ndoing a lot to augment scientists'\nunderstanding of what processes\nunderlie the human understanding\nprocess itself. Al is a relatively new field, and\nvarious people in the field have\ndifferent ideas about how research\npreviously. That's exactly how SAM\nreads stories. In fact, that's the only\nreason it can understand them in the\nfirst place: by having all that built-in\nknowledge about the situation that the\nstory is describing. Yale graduate students are currently\nworking on projects that tap\nknowledge, enabling SAM to figure\nout words from context, just as we do. If the computer read that story, it\nwould think that Bagawaga was a\ncountry after it read it; it would\nactually know a new piece of\ninformation. Other projects include\ngeneral learning programs that will\nenable the computer to talk about\nwhat it's learned, and to learn things\nexplicitly, as well as implicitly like\nSAM.",

MONDAY through FRIDAY PHONE 776-8522\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n# Re-Viewing Jean-Luc Godard, or\n## Why is This Man Smiling? ### the new journal, december 6, 1977\n\nA query some years ago to the editor of\nthe NYTimes Arts and Leisure section\nsuggesting an article on the Godard\nseries that had played at the Carnegie\nHall that summer elicited a polite no,\nthanks anyway, there's no news peg. I suppose there really wasn't,\nalthough the chance to see the\nnear-complete works of any director in\norder ought to merit some attention. And Godard, well for lots of us\nGodard wasn't just any director. I\noffered a tentative title on the order of\n\"The most important director of the\nsixties as seen from the vantage point\nthe seventies.\" I realized later that\ntheir editor was new, and maybe I\nshould have explained who Godard\nwas. Because Godard was more than just\nthe most \"important\" director of the\nsixties, in say the same way that\nNorman dello Joio could be called the\nmost important composer of the\nthirties. Cinematically Godard came\nvery close to being the sixties. (Of\ncourse a number of the old guard did\nsome of their finest work in the same\nperiod, and I wouldn't want to say that\neven the best Godard was necessarily\nbetter than Torn Curtain, El Dorado,\nor The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence. But those were retrospective winter's\ntales, and the sixties were more notable\nfor their newfangledness than their\nbackward glances.) Even at the time\nmany of us felt that the decade was\ndefining itself cinematically through\nthe dazzling and precocious assurance\nof Godard, and looking back it's\npossible to see even more clearly now\nhas almost all his films opened up\npossibilities, showed not just where he\nmight go next, but where movies could\nfollow. That's what made his films\nlook so different when you saw them a\ncouple of years later. Andrew Sarris\nprobably said it best,\n\n\"But Godard was a very special\ncase... The pattern was always the\nsame.",
  "Each new film would be assailed\nby his detractors as his biggest mess\nyet, and even his friends would look a\nlittle uncomfortable. A year later the\nsame film would look like a modern\nmasterpiece, and two years later like\nthe last full-bodied flowering of\nclassicism.\"\n\nAnd now that the great creative\nperiod seems to be over, we can look\nback again. The view has changed a\nbit.",
  "The narrative dislocations of\nPierrot le Fou, for example, no longer\nseem to intimidating as they once did. What Richard Roud called Godard's\n\"realism\" seems less important now\nthan the various stylizations, and these\ntoo seem less \"abstract\", to use the\nother pole of Roud's \"dialectic.\" I\ndon't know whether Godard would\nagree, though he might. He once\nanswered an interviewer's suggestion\nthat Pierrot had a lot of blood in it\nwith \"No, there's a lot of red.\"\nThe point of several of his pictures\nlooks different too. La/Une Femme\nMariee seems less a generalized\nindictment of that cliche of European\nfilmmaking (or at least American\ncritical reaction to it) \"the\nmeaninglessness of modern life\" than\na specifically pre-feminist work. Pierrot\nle Fou seems less and less about its\nadmittedly gorgeous North by\nNorthwest-like escape from the lights\nand rooftops of Paris to the cote\nd'azur, and more about its close-ups of\nAnna Karina. But for me the key to Godard seems\nto be lurking somewhere in the\nbackground of Sarris' remark.",
  "And\nthat I take to be something very akin\nto nostalgia. It's not a nostalgia for the\npast, except perhaps for his own artistic\nsalad days. Nor am I equating it with\nGodard's fabled \"romanticism\",\nalthough that's a bit closer. What I\nsense in Godard, and what moves me,\nis his incredible awareness of\npossibilities of the movies his movies\nmight have been, would like to be,\ncould never be. Example: At the end of his early\nfilm Bande a Part, one of the two\nheroes is shot after a suspenseful chase. The approach to that moment is\nextremely close in tone to the ending\nof Truffaut's Shoot the Piano Player,\nonly... Only Godard just can't do it. Instead, short-circuiting the emotions\nof the scene, he has Arthur run around\ncomically, like a chicken with its head\ncut off-a grotesquely funny dance of\ndeath. The camera never moves while\nArthur runs to the exact left edge of\nthe frame, then to the exact right\nedge-as if there were chalk marks on\nthe ground and this were a Minnelli\nmusical.",
  "Unable to believe in the\nconventions of his story, Godard\nevades, and switches genres. It's like\nthe moment in Pierrot Le Fou when\nKarina says \"Fin du roman Jules\nVerne; retournons au policier\ndeuxieme rang.\"\nBut Bande a Part was planned as just\nsuch a genre movie, a policier\ndeuxieme rang. It was to be his first big\nhit after Breathless.",
  "It didn't turn out\nthat way, of course. Godard couldn't\nmake it that way. He couldn't believe\nin the emotions proper to the death of\none of his characters. Yet his films are\nfilled with a yearning for just such\ngenres, just such moments of feeling. More than any other director I can\nthink of, Godard has had a very\nself-conscious relationship to his\nsources, whether in an individual story\nor a genre. But this relationship had\nbecome increasingly ironic,\nincreasingly one impossibility until,\nclutching at straws, he latched on to\nthe Maoist rhetoric that fills his latest\nfilms a true counsel of despair. You can watch this happening\nchronologically.",
  "That's what makes\neach film of Godard's a \"transition\nfilm\", as Ira Hauptman has pointed\nout. Renata Adler said rather\nlaconically of Les Carabiniers that it\nadvanced the art of cinema \"a step.\"\nAnd in fact critics at the time tended to\nemphasize the novelty of each film, to\nsee, if they understood them at all, the\ndoors each film was opening, even the\ndoors they were opening for cinema. What seem more important now are\nthe doors each film was closing for\nGodard. That's what I meant by nostalgia-a\nsearch for genres, feelings, certainties\nto hold on to. (Two of his films open\nwith the heroine saying \"Je ne sais\npas.\") What makes this earch so\npoignant is that these are usually the\nconventions and feelings he was able to\nbelieve in only a few films back. Pierrot\nle Fou seems to wish it could believe in\nlove as simply as does Une Femme est\nUne Femme, Weekend that it could\nhold onto even the partial affirmations\nof Pierrot. That's why Pierrot, though in the\nend, I think, less successful than his\nother outdoor 'scope and color epic,\nContempt, is ultimately so much\nmore affecting. Contempt, with its\nextensive use of classical illusion, its\nheroic images of statues and Fritz\nLang, marks a tributary direction in\nGodard's career. The value of Fierrot\nby contrast has much to do with its\ncentral place in that career. Martin\nRubin once called it\n\"One of those suicidal works\n(comparable to Welles' Lady from\nShanghai, Sternberg's Anatahan,\nFord's Seven Women) in which a\ndirector lays all his cards on the table\nand afterwards must either completely\nre-examine the nature of his art\n(Godard, Welles), or else stop making\nfilms altogether (Sternberg, Ford). But this is only especially true for\nPieerot; it holds, more or less, for all\nhis films.",
  "Godard's situation was thus like that\nof many of this characters. They too\noften try to live their lives according to\npast literary and cinematic models,\nand, like Godard, they usually fail. Anna Karina may be able to \"danser\ncomme dans les musicales de\nHollywood,\" though she does it\nwithout the hoped-for \"choreographie\nde Bob Fosse.\" But Arthur's romance\nwith Odille in Bande a Part can no\nmore be like Romeo and Juliet their\nEnglish teacher reads them than\nGodard can in fact make a real policier\n(or a real Hollywood musical)-any\nmore, in fact, than they can complete\ntheir teacher's exercise of translating\nthe modern French back into the\noriginal blank verse. (Of course Godard\nis aware that even Romeo and Juliet\ncouldn't live their lives by the already\noutdated Petrarchan love sonnet\nconventions they chose to incarnate.)\n\"Send her to watch Johnny Guitar,\"\nsays Belmondo of a lazy maid in Perrot\nle Fou; but we know it won't help. Richard Roud has described\nGodard's career in a series of almost\nhappy dialectics.",
  "I think its more a\nmatter of painful paradoxes. Godard is\nironizing genres at the same time as he\nwants to believe in them, just as his\nheavy irony toward the Maoist student\nheroes of La Chinoise can't conceal his\ndesire for the clarity of their\ndedication, the simplicity of their\nbelief. Godard couldn't help seeing the\ncontradictions: The terrible beauty of\nhis flaming car crashes; the visual\nappeal of those cranes, bridges,\nposters, and detergents he though were\ndestroying the Paris of 2 or 3 things;\nthe purity and justice of Bardot's\ncontempt in the film of that name, but\nalso the humane sadness of Piccoli's\n(continued on page 14)\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n# And All That Jazz\n### December 6, 1977\nA long, narrow room, rows of\nkitchen-type chairs, a\nconspicuous-and-proud-of-it soda\nmachine, and a make-shift stage area\nbring jazz home to the public in an\ninformal setting at New York City's\nJazz Museum.

He is an\nartist whose music can't be\ncategorized.",
  "And to complete the\nmurky image, he's extremely\ntemperamental and seldom gives\ninterviews. Most critics believe that\nJarrett's career is on the upswing, and\ntherefore he is more saleable and\nprintworthy than ever. In Billboard magazine terminology,\nJarrett has the ability to \"cross\nmarkets\" in record sales. His eclectic\nstyle appeals to jazz listeners, fans of\nso-called \"fusion\" music like Weather\nReport, all pianists, and even some\nclassical buffs. Albums like his Koln\nConcert solo recording have received\n5-star ratings from Downbeat\nmagazine and almost everyone else. His solo recordings on the ECM label\nhave been his biggest commercial\nsuccesses in this country. Jarrett is a classically-trained pianist\nwith effortless technique and a musical\nconception influenced by many\nsources, from folk songs to Debussy. Even to the uninitiated listener, his\nrecordings can be entrancing.",
  "Though\ninfluenced by the mainstream jazz\ntradition, Jarret is never just a jazz\nplayer, and at times he is not even an\nimproviser. He has many of the\npretensions of a \"serious composer.\"\nWith a set of conflicting\npreconceptions, this writer went to\nWoolsey Hall on November 10th to see\nand hear Keith Jarrett's American tour\ndebut. The tour is somewhat unusual\nin that Jarrett is playing with a group,\nmoreover, an all-Europeon group\ncalled Belonging. Norwegians Jan\nGarbarek, Palle Daniellson, and Jon\nCristensen accompany the pianist. This\ntrio has earned a solid reputation in\nEurope, and the combination of these\nmusical forces raised some speculation\nbefore the New Haven concert.",
  "In\nJarrett's three previous visits to this\ncity, he played solo. The presence of Belonging made\nlittle difference in Jarrett's overall\nperformance, as the pianist's playing\ncompletely dominated the ensemble. Not only did he fill a large part of the\nconcert with extended solo\nintroductions and interludes, he\ncontrolled the form and direction of\neach piece. Total group interaction,\nessential in this kind of free format,\nwas negligible.",
  "It sounded more like\nthree musicians trying to respond to\neach other's monologues. In his American tour debut at\nWoolsey, Jarrett also used two\ntechniques which have become\nstandard practices in his concerts of the\nlast few years. The first consists of\nhammering one note on the piano for\nwhat seems like hours.",
  "When he finally\nceased the audience burst into\nspontaneous applause, reminding me\nof the man who kept hitting his head\nagainst a brick wall because it felt so\ngood when he stopped. The second\ntechnique involves using different\nparts of the Steinway for percussion:\nthe strings, stool, lid, or anything else\nwithin reach. What does it all mean?",
  "It\nmust mean something; it sounds\nterrible. Jarrett has said that while on stage,\nhe lets his subconscious mind take over\nand tries to block out any conscious\nthoughts. This means that almost\nanything can happen in the long,\nloosely-structured improvisations, and\nthis approach can produce inspired\nmoments felt by every listener. Too\noften, it produces periods of uneven\nquality and sheer boredom. Whough\nthe Woolsey Hall audience was treated\nto a few minutes of intense playing,\nJarrett spent twice as much time\nfooling around, apparently waiting for\nhis subconscious to make the next\nmove. His concert recordings are\nselected from hours of live tapes, so the\nquality is consistently good. The\nconcert-goer doesn't have this luxury\nof selection, and dissappointing\nexperiences like the New Haven\nconcert are too often the result. Perhaps his subconscious had a bad\nnight, perhaps his concerts need a little\nmore conscious direction. Maybe\nJarrett really doesn't like American\naudiences. ## -Jon Prestley\n\nKeith Jarrett left many questions\nabout the future of his tour\nunanswered. He will probably remain\nan enigma, and a particularly\nfrustrating one, especially for his older\nfans. But enigma or not, knowing his\ntalent and potential, his New Haven\nconcert can only be called a\ndisappointment. ## Dutch Treat\n\nThis is the second in a series of two\narticles. As my concorde jet slowly cruised\nover the houses of Levittown into the\nblack smog of New York, I sat musing\nwhistfully and wishfully about my visit\nwith Hermien.

  "So I packed my\nduffelbag and bookbag and winged\nback to liberty, bringing her the paean\nI wrote in the last issue of this gazette. She was kind enough to notice, as soon\nas I walked onto her pasture, the little\nwrought-iron likeliness of her luscious\nself that now dangles daily before the\ndeaf-and-dumb eyes of my fellow\nundergraduates, enticing those poor\ncreatures so far removed from her\ngrace. After a fat and comforting hug,\nwhich filled my nostrils once again\nwith her earthy scent, she set about\nchiding me for my clothes. \"Where are\nyour wooden shoes?\" she mooed,\ntapping her hoof on my new, but\ncarefully worn, Topsiders. \"Those will\nnever do.",
