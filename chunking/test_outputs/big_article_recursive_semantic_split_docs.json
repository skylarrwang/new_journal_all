  "\n## Can Yale be Neutral? ### December 6, 1977\n\nIn 1970, a non-profit group called\nthe Project on Corporate Responsibility\nsponsored a campaign among\nshareholders in General Motors\nadvocating increased shareholder input\ninto the formulation of that company's\npublic policy, and increased attention\nto the social and political consequences\nof corporate actions. The trustees of\nthe Yale Corporation, which holds\n103,600 shares in GM, abstained from\nvoting on the shareholder resolutions. They did so, they explained, \" on the\nprinciple that the Fellows of the\nCorporation do not, and should not,\nhave the power to take a corporate\nposition on issues of a social or political\nnature. This principle derives from the\nphilosophy that a university is a\ncollegium or forum for the expression\nof a wide diversity of views. This\nconception is the cornerstone of\nacademic freedom.\" In doing so, the\nYale Corporation took the stance that\nits investments were \"neutral,\" and\nthat the mere act of owning and\nbenefitting from shares in no way\nimplies support or criticism of a\ncompany's actions. The trustees\nmaintained that to remain silent is to\nremain neutral.",
  "A year later, this statement met with\nserious questioning in a seminar\nproject led by Professor John Simon of\nthe Law School.",
  "The project\nformulated a set of guidelines for the\nconsideration of ethical questions\nrelated to investments. Yale responded\nby setting up the University-wide\nAdvisory Committee on Investment\nResponsibility. This body received as\nits sole power, however, the task of\nreviewing shareholder resolutions\nintroduced by other shareholders and\nadvising the Corporation on how it\nshould vote. The Advisory Committee\nhas never introduced a resolution of its\nown, and its recommendations are not\n\nYale's investments in companies\noperating in the Republic of South\nAfrica pose a serious challenge to this\nstance of neutrality. It is becoming\nincreasingly obvious that American\ninvestments there both directly and\nindirectly support the racist regime of\nJohn Vorster.",
  "Examples of direct aid\nare well known: IBM (Yale shares\n67,650) leases computers to the South\nAfrican police and prisons for the\nenforcement of the repressive passbook\nlaws; GM and Ford (Yale shares\n103,600and 127,500 respectively)\nsupply trucks to the military; Citicorp\nand J.P. Morgan (Yale shares 36,900\nand 35,200) made loans totalling\n$110 million to the South African\ngovernment in 1976 alone.",
  "But the\npresence of foreign investment by its\nvery nature, through the promotion of\ncapital-intensive-and highly\ntechnological industry, supports the\nwhite regime indirectly by serving only\nthe needs of the white population. Ambassador Radha Krishna Ramphul,\nupcoming President of the U.N. Security Council, told the Council in\nMarch of this year,\n\n\"It is crystal clear that foreign\ninvestment is not geared to improving\nthe situation in Southern Africa at\npresent. Foreign funds are not directed\nto agricultural development in the\nrural areas or to social programmes\nwhich would benefit the life of\nAfricans.",
  "The South African\ngovernment is not using those\nfunds...",
  "to dismantle apartheid in some\nabsentminded way. To the contrary,\nthanks to foreign investment and\nforeign loans, the South African\ngovernment has been able to build and\nmaintain a garrison state.\"\n\nIn addition, the recently enacted South\nAfrican law requiring foreign concerns\neither to produce what the government\norders or to face nationalization of\ntheir assets makes every corporation,\nwillingly or unwillingly, an accomplice\nto the continuation of apartheid. In view of such evidence, it is plain\nthat American corporate investment in\nSouth Africa is by no means neutral,\nbut is a bulwark in the fortress of\napartheid. This fact calls Yale's\nsupposed neutrality in investments\ninto serious question. If Yale continues\nto reap the benefits of the profits on\noppression in South Africa and\nremains silent, can it still claim that it\nis taking no stance? Is not this very\nsilence a position in support of foreign\ninvestment in South Africa, in support\nof apartheid? -by Nick Olcott and Alisa Klaus\n\nFor those of you who do not speak\nScientist, the title of writer-director\nSteven Spielberg's latest feature\ndescribes an intimate inter-planetary\nrendez-vous. Close Encounters of the\nThird Kind is not a futuristic\ndocumentary about inter-earthling\nperversions. Rather, it is an allegorical\nsci-fi melodrama about two people\nwhose intitial, illuminating brief\nencounter with a U.F.O. leaves them\nhaunted by its mysterious shape unt\u0131l\nthey find cosmic vindication of their\nvision. Close Encounters is an\nenjoyable minor fantasy on eternal\nthemes, but Spielberg's theological\npremise is shamelessly commerical and\nabsurdly simplistic. Alas, at the film's\nend I found myself quite as lost in the\nproverbial stars as I had been when I\nhopefully paid my $4.50; and to my\nsense of injury at the poverty of the\nspiritual transaction was added the\nequally enduring (albeit less\nexistential) insult of actual penury.",
  "After the film opens with the\ntraditional blinding explosion of white\nlight, the director thrusts us inside a\nMexican desert sandstorm reminiscent\nin ferocity of the Seven Plagues of\nEgypt. Here scientists are conducting a\nsearch for clues regarding the existence\nof extra-terrestrial life forms.",
  "When\nan inexplicably contented old man\nstammers in Spanish that \"the sun has\nsung\" to him, it is clear to all and\nsundry that something is rotten in the\nsolar system. Spielberg then transports\nus to the little house on the prairie in\nMuncie, Indiana, where Jillian Guiler\n(Milinda Dillon) lives with her toddler\nson, Barry. To his mother's horror,\nBarry is lured into the night by\nseductive extra-terrestrial vibes.",
  "She\ngives chase and catches him on a\ndeserted highway where both Guilers\nrun into Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfus),\na neighbor who claims to have seen an\nUnidentified Flying Object. As the\nadults stand arguing by the roadside,\nseveral 1977-style flying saucers fly by. Barry, delighted by the evocative\nconical Shape he perceives, trills out,\n\"Ice cream!\" Although Ronni Neary\n(Terri Garr) is understandably skeptical\nwhen her husband recounts his\nadventures, reports of strange\nphenomena all over the world (the\nearth) are released shortly, and Roy\nand Jillian rightly begin to suspect that\nthe fault is not in themselves but in\ntheir stars after all. In one of the picture's most striking\nscenes, little Barry is kidnapped by\nclouds of fire.",
  "Despite his mother's\ndesperate attempts to keep him locked\nin the house while star wars rage\noutdoors, he unerringly walks to the\nsingle unlocked door and opens it. The\nvisual allusion to The Wizard of Oz\nbecomes manifest: standing on the\nthreshold of a singing sun, Barry looks\nfor all the world like Dorothy opening\nthe door from her black-and-white\nKansas homestead into the infinitely\nmore vivid polychromatic Land of Oz. Like a supersonic Pied Piper, the\nU.F.O.",
  "charms the boy out into the\nglare and sweeps him off his feet.",
  "Jillian and Roy become obsessed\nwith the Shape. She cannot stop\nsketching it, while he sculpts it in every\ndollop of shaving cream, every\nspoonful of mashed potatoes. Each\nsenses the importance of the cryptic\nimage, yet neither can break the code."
