Bread is the oldest food that doesn’t require foraging or hunting. It has been an essential part of human history and formed early human societies. Wheat was domesticated in the Middle East, and cultivation of bread spread to Europe, North Africa, and East Asia. In the Black Desert in Jordan, charred bread crumbs have been discovered that are thought to have been made by Natufian hunter-gatherers (a culture from the epipaleolithic period). It’s believed these breadcrumbs are derived from wild wheat, wild barley, and plant roots and date back between 14,600 and 11,600 years ago.


Millstones for grinding grain dated 30,000 years old, suggest that bread was one of the first ever foods, and existed before humans became agricultural. Stone tools were used for cracking and smashing various cereals and grains to make them into a more versatile food. As humans evolved, we mixed these cracked grains with water to create a variety of foods including porridge. We also discovered that by leaving this paste out in the sun, it formed a dry bread-like crust. However, the success of this process relied heavily on the grains available and the weather.

The process of finding ingredients and developing practices to turn grain and water into a palatable food gave status and recognition to individuals. This helped towns become more ordered and sophisticated compared to Nomadic lifestyles where people had no fixed habitation.

10,000 BC
There is extensive evidence of bread being made and consumed in Egypt some 10,000 years ago during the Neolithic period. Bread was a staple of Egyptian food and everyone from the pharaoh to peasants consumed it.

The Egyptians also had other uses for bread and used types of thick, non-porous bread as containers for other meals. This type of bread was easier to bake than leavened flatbreads as it didn't need a vertical oven. In around 450 BC, Egyptians discovered they could make these meals using whatever grain was most available in generous amounts. This discovery later led to an uptake in agricultural activities which formed larger villages and settlements. As a result, this contributed to the creation of cities worldwide and is what we know as modern day society. It’s believed the most common source of making bread during Ancient times was to leave a piece of bread out from the day before (with sugar and water in) and serve it at dinner as a sourdough starter.

The toughness and structure of this bread enabled it to last longer. Iberians and Gauls used the foam from beer fermentation in their baking process to add a unique lightness and taste, whilst those who didn’t have beer in other parts of the world, used wine juice to do the same thing. In terms of cooking methods, these evolved over time and became more advanced. It’s believed the first free standing ovens with an open door for access were invented by the Greeks, with different breads being made including pastries and cakes. This is not too dissimilar from how we bake today.
