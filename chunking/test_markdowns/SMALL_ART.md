## Can Yale be Neutral? ### December 6, 1977

In 1970, a non-profit group called
the Project on Corporate Responsibility
sponsored a campaign among
shareholders in General Motors
advocating increased shareholder input
into the formulation of that company's
public policy, and increased attention
to the social and political consequences
of corporate actions. The trustees of
the Yale Corporation, which holds
103,600 shares in GM, abstained from
voting on the shareholder resolutions. They did so, they explained, " on the
principle that the Fellows of the
Corporation do not, and should not,
have the power to take a corporate
position on issues of a social or political
nature. This principle derives from the
philosophy that a university is a
collegium or forum for the expression
of a wide diversity of views. This
conception is the cornerstone of
academic freedom." In doing so, the
Yale Corporation took the stance that
its investments were "neutral," and
that the mere act of owning and
benefitting from shares in no way
implies support or criticism of a
company's actions. The trustees
maintained that to remain silent is to
remain neutral. A year later, this statement met with
serious questioning in a seminar
project led by Professor John Simon of
the Law School. The project
formulated a set of guidelines for the
consideration of ethical questions
related to investments. Yale responded
by setting up the University-wide
Advisory Committee on Investment
Responsibility. This body received as
its sole power, however, the task of
reviewing shareholder resolutions
introduced by other shareholders and
advising the Corporation on how it
should vote. The Advisory Committee
has never introduced a resolution of its
own, and its recommendations are not

Yale's investments in companies
operating in the Republic of South
Africa pose a serious challenge to this
stance of neutrality. It is becoming
increasingly obvious that American
investments there both directly and
indirectly support the racist regime of
John Vorster.
